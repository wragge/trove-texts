THE RED PAGE.
A MARCHING SONG.
~V~ W ERE we will say with our hands together
§■—-# War's red fury shall pass us by :
jl. JL. Let the old tups follow the old bell-wether,
Lambkins may lag and fly.
So, to your eyries , eagles of thunder !
So, to your carnage, vultures obscene !
She is not flesh for your beaks to plunder,
Our Australian queen.
We will not bring to her bright betrothal
Evil gifts from a poisoned past,
All the bane of the old-world brothel,
Monarchy’s scrofula, bane of caste :
Surely the cleansing seas shall purge us,
Halcyon skies shall yield their calm,
Surely the slave’s whip never shall urge us
Still to disdain her balm.
Here from Peace we dare not sever,
Borne by Toil, her charioteer,
Round and around, for ever and ever,
In the delight of the striving year.
Plough-lands, virgin, leap for the tillage ;
Stock-lands cry for the herd ;
Wealth is ours : shall we arm for pillage,
Gulled by an empty ivord
Glory 1 He who ran to the clarion
Saw, perchance, ere he lay to die,
Altar and throne, tioin birds of carrion.
Wheel above him—and knew the lie 1
Kings make war, and mourns the people
Lured by priests on the crimson tpuest:
Till the last king hangs from the last high steeple
Never the earth will rest.
Peace 1 and industry aye exalted ;
Peace ! and happiness held secure ;
Peace ! and liberty unassaulted
Shedding a blessing sure.
War ! the murderer decked in scarlet:
Leer and strut of an odious tribe ;
War 1 the labourer scorned as varlet,
Butt of his parasite’s jibe.
Peace ! and a new-born nation’s forces
Saved, conserved for a nation's pains ;
War ! and a nation’s strong resources
Leeched and bled from a million veins.
Strife of destinies, urgent, real,
Bids us sow for the future’s dues:
How shall we range our proud ideal ?
Under which banner, choose 1
What! with Freedom, a babe, to bind her !
We from gyves so hardly won:
What / with the gibbering dark behind her,
Turn aloof from the risen sun /
■Hateful legacies, seeds of quarrel,
Spurn them down to the black abyss :
Lift young brows to the peaceful laurel /
Stifle the serpent’s hiss.
She, the Muse of a world’s oblation,
She, the beldam dabbled with blood,
She, the honoured, dishonoured nation —
Lo, where she drowns in mud !
Praise her, giver of high example ;
Praise her, olden tyranny’s foe ;
Praise her, mother of genius ample :
Curse her, and let her go.
Hold we fast in our kin’s alliance ?
Let us have justice, peer with peer ;
Independence is no defiance:
Those our lovers, how should they fear t
Pliant courtiers fawn to slay us —
Lice of politics, left of their pride:
Judas and Jezebel join to betray us—
Sycophants 1 crawl aside.
Come what may, that the old beast-nature
Snarls and crouches and seeks our doom:
Why for that shall we brook dictature
When we shall war, and how, with whom ?
Self-revering, an armed Australia
Well may fight for her own young brood—
Never, to gild a king’s regalia.
Never in foreign feud.
So let us swear, with hearts together,
War’s red ruin shall pass us by :
Young limbs freed from the time-old tether,
Young broivs lifted high.
Swift to your eyries, eagles of thunder !
Sloio to your carnage, vultures obscene /
She is not flesh for your beaks to plunder,
Our Australian queen.

Now that Lond. limes has thrown away what
igniCy Pigott left it, and is hustling for dollars like any
other book-agent, Australians should beware of the
transferred-credit fallacy. Victims of this fallacy ar<nie

therefore A s opinion in the separate and distinct field of

Siimlarly, when The Encyclopaedia Britannica had
passed out of date, and was in great part superseded,
Lond Times issued an edition, added the current
credit of The Thunderer” to the bygone credit of the
encyclopaedia, and converted the two credits into cash.
Quite a number of Australian flats were caught, and
nought for fifteen guineas or so a monument to the
ullness of their intellects. In a great degree they did
not buy encyclopaedia : they bought their own notion of
the importance of Lond. Times. Chambers’s Encyclo-
paedia, up-to-date and for all practical purposes superior,
was on sale for one-fourth of the money ; but the trans-
ferred-credit serpent beguiled them.

The Century Dictionary, Atlas, and Cyclopaedia, in ten
volumes for £VI 10s. and upwards. There are probably
n,h ! l e People in Australasia to whom it is
worth the money. Possibly five thousand people will
buy it because it is a good article, and can be bou°-ht
by instalments, and the drum of advertisement is beaten
by London Times. Nevertheless, it is not worth the
money, considering the use you can make of the

THE NEEDLEWORK CURE
work°' W men ■*° !jo never doing needle-
Of those who complain that reading is their only
dehsht and recreation, and that even reading threatens
to pall, I ask attention to this simple experience. Many
•a time coming home after a day’s work, weary, and
hungrily restless for something to restore the tone of
mind and body, have I taken up a favourite author of
notion, or history, prose or verse, to fling them down
again in disgust; not one has had the power to refresh or
console. Disappointed and sick at heart, I have turned
to the work-basket, and, behold, a miracle ! For as the
needle plies along the seam, or threads its mazy way
through some intricate art design, a thousand happy
memories of things that I have read come flitting into the
mmd like homing birds, there to mate with others of
their kind, and nestie round the store-house of the brain.
The needle pricks its straight or devious- course, but
the rapt mind moves only in the light that never was on
sea or land, and knows itself in Paradise. May not the
reason that women are so often better readers than men
lie in the fact that it is hardly ever possible for them to
spend all their leisure in reading, because of the im -
penous demands of the übiquitous needlework, which,
however, has its compensations, since, being pre-
eminently mechanical, it leaves the mind free to roam
among the memories of past reading, and enjoy afresh
the beauties culled therefrom ? M. Santos Dumont knits,
I have read, while mentally resolving some difficult pro-
blem of aerial engineering.—o. M. J., in T.P.’s Weekly
LITTLE CONTEIBUTORS
L.B. : Is it necessary to enumerate the in-
stances of a nation being at its best concurrently with
the production of great dramas by native writers?
Athens and .Eschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristo-
phanes. Elizabethan England—and Marlowe, his con-
temporaries and immediate successors, amongst them
Shakespear. In modern times, the insurgenee of Nor-
wegian nationalism along with the advent of Bjornson
and Ibsen ?
Why can we not have an Australian drama? In poetry
a,nd prose-fiction there has been a large amount of
literary effort, resulting in some very creditable work.
In drama is there the least of attempts? Melbourne has
five theatres, Sydney shortly will have six, and other
Australian cities have one or two each. But the play-
bills never announce a play by a local dramaturgist.
Australian theatrical managers are not altogether fools.
They do not discourage the native playwright. There is
no native playwright to.discourage. If someone brought
along a romantic play as good as If I Were King
Williamson would not refuse it. Or a farce better than
Are lou a Mason? —a not very wonderful piece of
dramatic workmanship or literary value. There is
money in play-writing. Anderson gave £5OO for
the Australasian rights of A Woman of Pleasure
Williamson £! 000 for Sherlock Holmes. Eor every person
in Australia who buys a six-shilling novel there are at
least a thousand who pay from three to five shillings for a
dress-circle seat. A good pjay bv an Australasian writer
would be worth several hundreds for the Australasian
rights alone. He could still retain the rights for the rest
of the world.
There are other factors to be noted. The principal one
is the utterly contemptible way in which the theatres are
“ done” by the so-called “critics.” These “critics” are
ordinary pressmen who turn out good, bad, or indifferent
copy about a prize-fight or a rise in the price of meat
They report a show; criticise it—never. But the in-
iquities of Australian theatrical criticism would need a
whole pamphlet.
Kiwi: “Quilp N.” was right re M.L. copy-
right. The position, as defined by several decided cases
is this : Our Copyright Ordinance of 1842 grants to
authors, without registration, ,28 years protection for
works first produced in this country. The International
Copyright Act 1886 (Imperial) is in force, not only
throughout the British Empire, but throughout the
“ Copyright Union,” as designed by the Berne Conven-
tion of 1885. The statute is subject, however, to the law
of each country in the Union, and as it does not repeal
our own ordinance of 1842, it is really not in force in
Maoriland at all. The only way in which a Maoriland
author could get the benefit of the Act, therefore, would
be to publish his work in England [or Australia.—B.]
first. It would be easy to induce Parliament to pass the
necessary legislation if it understood the true position ;
but it doesn’t ; and, generally, Parliament doesn’t care'
about things that do not spell votes.
“Gael”: Why does Jessie Mackay put a Teu-
tonic dialect into the mouth of an aged Celtic exile?
My mother was bred in Appin ; I have travelled all over
the Scottish Highlands ; but I have yet to hear the Doric
of the Lowlands from the lips of the Gaelic-speaking Celt
“For love of Appin,” thought and expressed in Gaelic,
would have been inexpressibly heart-moving: failing
that, why should Miss Mackay not use modern English?
As one whose mother tongue is Gaelic, I assure her that
the Lowland Scottish words in this poem are jarring
notes.
Quilp N.: Even in Homer’s day the literary
robber prayed on writers’ brains. In Buckley’s Life of
Horruir are these passages :—“ There was, at that time an
unprincipled man named Thestorides at Phocasa, a
teacher of the rudiments of literature. Having observed
the talents of Homer, he offered to shelter and take care
of him if, as recompense, Homer would permit him to
take down his verses in writing... . Homer, being poor
and destitute, accepted his offer. ... He composed the
little Iliad When Thestorides had taken down that
poem and the rest he had received from Homer, he
left Phocaea.” Homer followed, and “ When Thestorides
heard that Homer was in Chios he left the island.”
BOOKFELLOWSHIPMENT
“To those who have travelled through the vast
fertile districts of North America,” writes “Northum-
brian” in Reynolds's of April 19, “nothing is more
impressive than the absolute human silence, so to speak
which reigns for hundreds of miles at a stretch. The soil
is deep and rich, the great trees murmur in solitude • the
rivers, teeming with fish, roll on neglected. All nature
seems to be silently awaiting the arrival of civilised man
to wield the axe, to drive the furrow, and gather in the
harvest. But he is slow to come. Many travellers have
spoken of the impressions thus made upon them as almost
akin to one of despair.”
Unluekily The Bulletin of Feb. 21, containing Quinn’s
expression of the same notion regarding Australia
reached London a few days before this was published ; or
the passage would be cited to show a curious parallel of
ideas. It is cited to show a familiar conjunction of
scissors.
Reynolds’s is a useful paper, despite the disgust of
many English bred on the theory of “God bless the
squire and his relations and keep us in our proper
stations.” The Bulletin’s Lond. correspondent had an
Idea in regard to Reynolds’s not long ago. He had noticed
that his London paragraphs travelled to the antipodes
returned to the antipodes, and recurred in Reynolds’s--
often with an acknowledgment to the antipodes. So he
wrote to the editor : Why not let me write similarly for
you.at first-hand—and save waiting? The editor replied :
No ; it would not do ; we find it impossible to get matter
written in London as it is written for The Bulletin. And
he continued reprinting !
Reynolds’s is English too.
The Academy has to protest against Henley's
declaration in May Pall Mall Maya, that for “ four-fifths
of his time [Wordsworth] rs but a piddling poetaster.’’

Faguet s dictum that Zola wrote too early Everyman
who writes before thirty, and who does not consecrate
lifes golden age, from twenty to thirty, to reading
observation, and reflection, without writing a line risks
having no brains and becoming a mere literary workman
Exceptions are rare ’’—but the rule is chimerical.
In a Maoriland paper’s competition to fix the
twelve greatest poets, British or American,’’our old
friend David the Psalmist received 100 votes! It was
not made clear whether the competitors thought he
wrote in English, or whether they regarded him as a
typical Early Briton.
S.M. Herald recently distributed the prizes
of its eighth international chess-problem tourney. Two
of three were sent to Jamaica, the third to Paris
Other competitors hailed from Russia, Bohemia, and
Bessarabia. We cannot see the sense of sending Aus-
tralian money to Jamaica, or encouraging players in
Bessarabia. If the Herald’s object is to benefit itself
and Australia, the competition should be confined to
Australians. Australia cannot yet match the world at
chess, and Australian players are not impelled to enter
lists where they are practically sure to be beaten. They
must creep before they walk. To stimulate them to
creep, they should surely be protected from world-
jostling. When local competition has trained learners
to expertness, then let them confront the foreigner.
The Bill of Twelve Millions is a bribe to Ire-
land to be good and let bygones be bygones, and, of
course, Ireland will—till the money is spent. But even
in face of the bribe, the literary Irish are irreconcilable.
The protest against King Edward’s reception which
hustled Maud Gonne from a Dublin platform is made by
the “ Literary Renascence” representatives generally.
In Yeats’s eyes the visit is an affront to serious national
life—it “will appeal to all that is superficial and trivial
in society.” Edward Martvn, who wrote The Heather
Field, is also protesting. We have n’t heard from George
Moore yet; but we shouldn’t be surprised to hear of
George carrying a pike to. the royal landing-stage.
Those “artists.” “What’s the matter with
Blank ? He seems very grumpy. Didn’t they let him
into the Teaching Association ? ” “Oh yes ; he got in ail
right. He’s grumpy because Dash got in too.”
Repeating our thought, The Spectator writes
(April 4), “ The best incense which the most devoted
disciples can offer to the memory of a great man is to
proceed in the direction in which he pointed, not to go
back and try to conjure up his personality.. .The con-
centrated study of the past dazzles the mental eyes, and
makes it difficult to grope along the path which leads
into the future." We should not be permanently on our
knees before the immortal W S. Better be up and doing
to find or create an Australian Shakespear.
D’Annunzio’s dream of a new world-theatre,
magnificently equipped to enforce the message of the
modern drama, has been made possible by American
dollars. A Miss Morgan has promised to Eleonora Duse
£BO,OOO to build a palace where d’Annunzio's genius shall
be interpreted to its highest by Duse’s genius ; and the
ooeb plans to play in Italy’ the national-apostolic part
:hat Bjornson played in Norway.
This portrait of Duse, the actress who disappoints many
and exalts her admirers to the pitch of worship, is repro-
duced from one of VV. Nicholson's characteristic drawings.
Some of the younger American illustrators are developing
Nicholson’s method effectively in three-tone pictures—
pure white and black, and a grey.

Requires no drug auxiliaries to stimulate
you. It is life. It gives you new energy,
adds ambition to your existence, warms the
heart, invigorates the circulation, expands
the tissues, develops the organs, and in three
months will make the weak, run-down man or
woman forget they ever had a pain. It is a
certain cure for Indigestion, Constipation,
Kidney and Liver Troubles, Rheumatism,
Lame Back, Kervous Affliction, Dull Pain in
the Head, Over and Around the Eyes. We
give you no additional drugs by this method.
They only add to your misery.
Worn while you sleep, our Belt pumps the
soothing, invigorating life current into your
body for hours at a time. The current is
infused into the nerve cells and tissues, it
generates warmth and activity into the blood,
adds fuel to the dying fire, and produces life
and vigorous health.
Do not buy an Electric Belt un-
less you have absolutely decided
to take
NO MORE DRUGS.
We know that no man remains weak and ill
because he likes it, or because he wants to.
It is because he has been unable to find a
remedy that will cure him. Many men have
wasted time and money on drugs and medi-
cinal treatment , when drugs were the last
things they should have turned to. The vital
element, the life of the nerves and tissues in
the human body is electricity, and when the
normal supply is exhausted nothing under the
sun will replace it, except a current of electri-
city carried into the body from the outside.
If every organ and tissue and nerve in the
body was full of electricity, there could be no
weakness—no disease could exist. Therefore,
when you are weak or ill you must use electri-
city if you want to get well.
LIFE LONG EPILEPSY.
5 Prentice Street, Brunswick, Vic.
Dear Sirs,—l am happy to be able to inform you that your High
Grade Electric Belt has had a wonderful effect upon my trouble,
viz., Epilepsy, from which I have been a great sufferer as long as I
can remember.
My seizures, which were of about weekly occurrence, have so
far been reduced that, in four months, I have had only one. I will
gladly answer any enquiries from fellow-sufferers, and can conscien-
tiously recommend your mode of treatment. Faithfully yours,
J F. MATHEWS.
“Stanmoie,” Hay Street, Perth, W.A.
Dear Sir,—Regarding your Electric Belt, I am glad to tell
you it is working well. I am still wearing it regularly,
and have every confidence in its good results. lam rapidly
recovering, and hope to continue so, although you
cannot cure a case like mine in a week-. lam working regu-
larly, that is more than I did before I used it, and, what’s
more, I can sleep splendidly and eat well. I hope, in the
near future, to send you an honest testimonial, accom-
panied by my photo., to show the sickly world the honest
good your Belt has done to an unfortunate, one-time
cripple. I remain, Yours, R. G. O. SALTER.
LAME BACK.
Patutahi, Poverty Bav, N Z
Dear Sir,—With regard to the Electric Belt which I'got from
you, I beg to inform you that lam pleased with it so far. I have
just worn it one month to the day, and it has relieved me of the
lameness in my back ; in a word, it has done all I could reason-
ably expect in so short a time. When I think of the knavery and
trickery and roguery of a great many of the so-called would-be
cures, I am somewhat surprised at your straightforward dealing
and I like you for it, and will not fail to let it be known —Yours
respectfully I remain, dear sirs, JAMES CHAMBERS.
BELT WITHOUT DRUGS.
We do not advertise to sell you an Electric Belt, and when you come for one tell you that you don’t need electricity, that a Belt WITHOUT drue-
is useless. We insist that it is foolish for you to buy drugs. Drug treatment is expensive and useless if you have a really good Electric Bodv armli a « S
The reason WE DON’T TRY TO SELL YOU DRUGS is that our “ Belt ” is an electric appliance, manufactured by practical Electricians in accordance
with our patent specifications, not made by manufacturing jewellers, as others generally are, and because a genuine Electric Belt cures without drug
assistance.

what puzzles

When the hair is starved, it stops
growing, loses its lustre, falls out,
turns gray. Ayer’s Hair Vigor is a
hair-help. It makes the hair grow,
stops it from falling, and completely
cures dandruff.
Ayer's Hair Vigor
If your hair is fading or turning
gray, begin at once with Ayer’s Hair
Vigor. It will positively restore color
to your gray hair, all the full, rich
color it had in early life.
As a hair-dressing you will certainly
like it, for it keeps the hair soft and
glossy and prevents it from splitting
at the ends.
Do not be deceived by cheap imita-
tions which will only disappoint you.
Make sure that you get the genuine

The Return.
And O, the heart o’ me !
Here is a pretty looking-glass
Set in a silver tree
Fore which she used to pose and pass
In sweet conspiracy.
And here the agate-headed pin
That with the silky net
Did hedge about and gather in
Her hair’s bright coronet.
O, splendid heroine!
Here do you see the verse of love,
The lovely versical
Inscribed; below a flying dove,
Above, a philomel...
Behold her scented glove !
And here’s the belt she always wore,
With jade in every ring
And, at the end, a tiger’s claw
To make a fastening,
(Deep-hidden metaphor)
And see, her double candle-stick
Upon the bureau stands
This morning, with a blackened wick
And streaked with snowy bands
Of wax, blown thin and thick.
But she has gone, for aye, away,
And left these things behind
(To add forgetlessness each day
To eyes that would be blind)
In profligate display.
Nay L.Hark 1...1 hear her petticoat
Lap-lapping like a wave
That bears a Naiad-child afloat—
And O, again that stave
Of music from her throat!
Beat high, glad heart o’ me !
Go, place the pretty looking-glass
Set in its silver tree
Where she may pose again and pass
In fresh conspiracy.

When Heath-bells Wave.
The leaves of the lightwood were tender green
And a brighter tinge on the gums was seen ;
The scent of the wattles was in the air
When the heath-bells waved on the hillside fair.
Through the grey old gum-trees a silver gleam
And a rippling murmur revealed the stream,
Half-hidden in moss and in maiden-hair,
When the heath-bells waved on the hillside fair.
Over the range came a man and a maid,
And they lingered long in the lightwood shade,
For sweet was the love-tale he whispered there
When the heath-bells waved on the hillside fair.

We’re getting old in Nature’s books,
But man’s no older than he feels
Nor woman older than she looks.
So we will gambol while we may,
And trip it with the careless throng ;
Though years be heavy, hearts are gay—•
If we can love we yet are young.
Bind roses in your golden hair,
Bright ribbons pin upon your breast;
Though you be old you yet are fair,
And youthful ways become you best;
We’ll whirl away our youth’s last days,
And sing to Cupid syren’s song,
We’ll wile the hours with amorous lays—
If we can love we yet are young.
And if our passions sluggard grow
There’s wine to stir them into pace,
And we may make them brighter glow
Than when we started in the race ;
So let us not then lag behind,
Too soon the old folk stay among.
Let Care not weigh upon the mind—
If we can love we yet are young.
Drink to the bottom of our cup,
Drink while the mad fumes Time defy,
Drink with the flagon tilted up,
When it is emptied we will die.
Bask till the last in Youth’s bright rays,
Drink in the strength of red wine strong,
Game to the last we’ll end our days—
If we can love we yet are young.
VIC.
PAUL MELL.
The Sea Wall.
Creepers cling never with tender arms
To fold you round ;
Bare and unhung your grey stones are
From top to ground.
Only the sea creeps shimmering
To kiss your feet;
Smiling and joyous, or slumbering
With dreamings sweet.
Sometimes the waves come laughingly
Up to your side,
Thinking to win you— carry you
Off on the tide.
Dancing and splashing, they cover you
With kiss upon kiss ;
Hold you and fold you and bury you,
Beaming with bliss.
Ever the sea comes courting you ;
And for your sake,
The hearts of the waves despairingly
At your feet break.
Little you care for-the waves’ embrace;
But just for two . •
Dreamers who dream by your dear grey side ;
Your heart is true.

ITCHING HUMOURS
SPEEDY CURE TREATMENT
FOR EVERY HUMOUR.
Bathe the affected parts with hot water and CUTICURA
SOAP, to cleanse the skin and scalp of crusts and scales, and
soften the thickened cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing, and
apply CUTICURA OINTMENT freely to allay itching, irritation,
and inflammation, and soothe and heal, and lastly take CUTI-
CURA RESOLVENT PILLS, to cool and cleanse the blood.
This pure, sweet, and wholesome treatment affords instant
relief, permits rest and sleep, and points to a speedy, perman-
ent, and economical cure of the most torturing, disfiguring,
itching, burning, and scaly skin, scalp, and blood humours,
eczemas, rashes, and irritations, from infancy to age, with
loss of hair, when all else fails.
MILLIONS OSE CDTICURA SOAP
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment, for preserving, purifying, and beautify-
ing the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, and for all the pur-
poses of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Millions of Women use Cuticura
Soap in the form of baths for annoying irritations, inflammations, and
excoriations, for too free or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes
for ulcerative weaknesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especiallv mothers.

You know that no man is worth anything athletically whose muscles are not elastic. He may
have good wind, a strong heart, big lungs, a clear head, and a long stride. Yet it all counts for
nothing — yes, absolutely nothing —if his muscles lack elasticity.
In other words, stiffen him up with rheumatism and you undermine all his value, vou render
every good quality worthless.
Rheumatism in a man has its counterpart in portable roofings. A portable roofing without
elasticity is like an athlete with rheumatism. Ruberoid Roofing is elastic when you buy It and it
always remains elastic.
The Greeks used to say, “ You can judge of Hercules’ stature by his foot.” You know it is not
the foot of a baby, a child, or an adult, but of a giant.
You can tell the difference between rheumatic roofings and the Giant kind by the name
“ Ruberoid” which is stamped on every yard of the Genuine.
Be sure you get genuine Ruberoid. If in doubt write to the following

How the Tory Cuts His Own Throat.
J ust now a person may take up any Australian
daily paper with a dead certainty of finding in it
two wails—probably the two wails a dozen times
repeated. One is the wail about the cessation of
the influx of capital ; the other, the wail about
the practical stoppage of immigration. And
the daily paper, being mostly a rich Tories’
paper, always decides that these two evils
arise through “the dominance of Labor in
politics.” The Bulletin has been casually
cutting out and hoarding up samples of this
curious phase of alleged Thought, and drop-
ping them in a drawer as specimens of a strangely
helpless frame of mind. It dips its hand into its
drawer-full of wails and takes out a sample at
random from among the dozens there accumu-
lated :
The unfortunate position the States are placed in, con-
sequent upon the Labor question, is now becoming
serious. London papers clamor against the tyranny to
which we are subjected. The servants have become
masters. Under these circumstances, we can hardly
expect London financiers to come to our rescue by taking
up future loans, except at advanced rates of interest.
That chance sample (the drawer-full includes wails
from 37 daily newspapers and many trade publica-
tions of one kind and another) is a fair specimen
of the lot. Just now, Australia is full of lament-
ings about the falling off in the influx of people
and the influx of money, and imposing statements
to the effect that Labor legislation is responsible
for all the trouble. The Bulletin proposes to
discourse on this subject in a purely impartial
frame of mind. For the moment, it intends
to borrow a high bell-topper and a long
frock-coat, and try to imagine itself a
worried Tory seeking dispassionately for the
reason of his temporary inability to make money.
Only it will try, in doing so, not to be quite so
great a fool as the average Tory, or so helpless a
sample of humanity.
* * * *
In the first place, Labor politics are compara-
tively new things. There has never been a Labor
Government except Anderson Dawson’s six-
days’ hopeless minority Ministry in Queensland.
The Labor party forms a dismally small minority
in Queensland, N.S.W., and S.A. ; an almost
invisible minority in the other three States. If'
Labor has done anything bad, then theanti-Labor
politicians, instead of cursing Labor, should de-
nounce their own incapacity, their ignorance, their
utter unfitness for self-government. What Labor
has won has been practically all won since 1896 or
1897. Factory laws, minimum-wage laws, old-age-
pension laws, arbitration laws, have all sprung up
since then. But the influx- of capital stopp'ed-
short in 1891, when the Tory person’s boom broke
and the Tory person’s banks began to go up the
unholy spout, and all confidence in the Australian
Tory person’s honesty or discretion went out of
the world. This is N.S.W. State Statistician
Coghlan’s statement (“Seven Colonies of Aus-
tralasia” for 1901-2, page 757) of the amount of
private money sent to Australasia for investment
in recent years (they are all five year periods
except the last one):
1871-75—Withdrawal of foreign capital .. £2,892,000
1876-80—Influx of foreign capital .. .. 11,407,000'
1881-85 Do .... 87,186,000'
1886-90 Do .... 49,077,000
1891-95 —Withdrawal of foreign capital .. 1,322,000
1896-1901—Influx of foreign capital .. 13,870,000
On the strength of this official pronouncement by
the only. Australian statistician whose figures
carry weight all over the world, The Bulletin
desires to point out that the withdrawal of
foreign capital was an event which happened
here ndarly 25 years before there was any
Labor party to put the responsibility on;
that in recent years the only withdrawal took
place in the days when the Tory person made
his infamous bank smashes ; and that during
the era of old age pensions, arbitration laws,
factory laws,. and other conspicuous examples
of Labor legislation, the influx of capital has
resumed. The question whether the influx of
capital, being merely an influx of debt, is desirable
is another matter ; the matter at issue is that the
daily press says it is desirable, and says that
Labor politics have killed it. And on the evi-
dence of Australasia’s greatest statistician, The
Bulletin calls that press—notably the Sydney
Telegraph, Melbourne Argus and Age, Laun-
ceston Examiner, and Brisbane Courier —a liar.
* * * *
As regards the influx of population, Coghlan
(“Seven Colonies of Australasia” for 1901-2,
page 536) also carries his figures up to end of 1901,
and shows, as regards the Commonwealth States,
these remarkable results in four periods of five
years each:
1882—1886 Net Gain by Immigration .. 232,023
1887—1891 Do; „ 140,817
1892—1896 Net Loss by Emigration .. 622
1897—1901 Net Gain by Immigration .. 1116
Again, on the evidence of the one great statistical
authority of this country The Bulletin declares
the Tory press to be a liar, for the evidence shows
that the influx of money stopped short when
public confidence in this country was destroyed
by the Munros, Matthew Davieses, Finks,
Bents, Abigails and all the rest of the crowd of
bank boomers, and instead of immigration ceasing
with the beginning of the recent “ socialistic legis-
lation ” it only showed some faint signs of reviving
about that period. It wasn’t the six hatters but
the 66 or so. dishonest banks that made the
trouble. It isn’t Labor legislation, but the
memory of the millions out of which the Tory
party diddled them with lying balance-sheets,
that scares the British investor.
* » * *
This is not a time for useless recrimination, but
The Bulletin, trying for the moment to feel like
a Tory and a Fat Man, is aggravated at the stupid
narrowness, the short-sightedness, the suicidal
tendencies of the class to which it (temporarily)
belongs. There is room for the bell-toppered class
m Australia to make a fortune now if it could
only see a yard ahead of it—which, apparently, it
can't do. Its whole policy at present consists in
sitting down and bewailing the imaginary evils of
Labor legislation. It has taken to its soul the de-
lusion that the results of its own dishonesty, ignor-
ance, folly and incapacity are all the results of
Labor legislation which didn’t exist till long after-
wards, and it has done this solely to avoid admit-
ting that it has been ignorant, foolish and incap-
able ; and it is so comforted by the delusion that it
sits still and does nothing except curse Labor
legislation.
» * • *
The question why money and people with
money do not come here more freely should be
easily answered. A capitalist does not come here
to put his money in the Queensland National
Bank, or the A.J.S. Bank, or the Australian
Deposit and Mortgage Bank, or the Land Mort-
gage Bank of Australia. Australia is so full of
damaged or partially convalescent banks, and of
the ruins of banks that went broke altogether,
that there is a gloom over Australian institutions
in general. The capitalist wouldn’t come here to
buy drought-stricken country lands. He is darkly
suspicious about city lands lest the fearful slump
of ten years ago may be repeated. He wouldn’t
come here to start a new bank, or a new insur-
ance office; these fields are appallingly over-
crowded. As to starting a new manufacturing in-
dustry, he is willing enough to do that in Canada
or the United States, where the market is growing
constantly with the increase of population, and
where he knows for certain that that market is re-
served solely for the manufacturer in the country.
But the Australian tariff is so low that he can
send his goods here without the trouble of building
local factories. So long as the Commonwealth
imports goods to the value of .£ll or .£l2 per
head annually there isn’t much room for the
manufacturer, and so long as there is a strong
party here which demands more imports, so long
will he be afraid that there will be still less room
for him than there is now. The foreign manu-
facturer never brought his capital and his mill
and settled down here, even when there was no
Labor party and no Labor legislation. What-
ever he may be in theory, he has consistently
lighted out for high tariff countries in practice.
The country that attracts him is always the
one where he can rely on having the market
himself, and. he doesn’t care whether the
M'Millan man is taxed out, shut out, or hanged
for coming in. But when he finds a country
preaching the gospel of the beauty of importing
calico he doesn’t go to that country and try to
make calico. Even the fact that he would pay
far less land tax, income tax and local rates here
than in most countries doesn’t fetch him.
* * * *
As to why immigrants of the ordinary class
don t come here in any large numbers, that is
easy of explanation. To the agricultural immi-
grant Australia says : “ You may go out into the
dry regions where there is & crop once in seven
years, and get . land for almost nothing, and
die of thirst on it. In the well-watered country
the good land that remains is mostly held by
large English companies or by private landlords
and they either won’t sell at all or ask about £4O
an acre. They want more than you can now buy
land for in England. Our own farmers are
going from Victoria to N.S.W., from NSW
to Queensland, to Maoriland, to Tasmania—
vainly looking for land because the big companies
and the great individual landowners won’t sell
and no one makes them sell. They are even
going to Canada and Africa and Argentina look-
nig for land —so what chance is there for you’”
To the artisan in almost every line of skilled in-
dustry Australia says: “ Your industry doesn’t
exist here. We import these things. We have
nothing to offer you.” And to everybody Aus-
tralia says: “We have already about the largest
proportion of unemployed known among civilised
\vhite races, so there is practically no hope for
you, and if ycni stay you must shoulder a bigger
share of public debt than is to be found in anv
other country_q.ii .earth. _Quj dght.is really The
only thing we have to offer you.” And, in the
face of all this, the lory person fails to under-
stand why immigration is scanty.
* * * *
What the trader of every description wants is
a high-wage population—a population that can
afford to buy lots of things at his emporium ; yet
the trading classes in general bellow for low wages
in order that the great mass of the people won’t
be able to buy their goods. The trading class
wants, above all things, to see the big estates cut
up, compulsorily and promptly, and the land
■closely settled with prosperous small farmers who
will buy their goods, and purchase the Argus
every morning. There is room for 40,000 such
farmers in the Western District of Victoria alone,
yet the traders are mostly allied to the many big
landholders who keep these small farmers out
altogether, and the few big landlords who let them
in and rack-rent them so mercilessly that they
have very little money to spend at anybody’s
emporium. What the trading classes badly want
is new manufactures and 50,000 new artisans in
Melbourne and Sydney to spend their wages—
their high wages—at the traders’ shops. It
doesn’t matter to the trader even if all the
theories of Cobdkn are knocked endways, so long
as these industries are created ; yet the trading
classes are mostly with the big importers, and
because a country can’t import its clothes and its
ironwork, and manufacture them at the same time,
these 50,000 extra customers are not here. They
won’t be here while there is no work for them to
do, and there can’t be any work while the things
they ought to be making are imported. And
because they are not here the landlords’ houses
remain empty, and the trader’s shop remains
half empty, and the Argus’s circulation doesn’t
go up, and the bank’s business doesn’t improve,
and the public debt, which would be only £2B a
head if we had double the population is £56 a
head, and just because it is £56 a head the income-
tax is twice as high as it need be. So the fool
Tory sits down and saws persistently at his own
throat. His one idea is to cut down wages so that
the community won’t be able to buy his goods,
and so that there may be no attraction for immi-
grants. People don’t come 16,000 miles to get
their wages reduced.
* * * *
Labor legislation hasn’t stopped the influx of
either men or capital; they have both revived a
little under its auspices. It hasn’t diminished
manufactures ; they are greater now than they
ever were before. But Australia never had a
cjuarter the manufactures it required to support
its people, and for years and years under the Tory
regime the mass of the community lived on public
loans, private loans, land sales, and public works.
Up to 1890 this was the great drunk nation of the
earth. Now that these numerous forms of public
I O U are about exhausted, this country is face to
face with the fact that it can’t find work even for
its present agricultural population, unless more
good land is made available, and how land can
be made available unless the large holders who
keep it locked up are compelled to throw it open is
a question that the Tory press never answers. It
is also face to face with the fact that it can’t find
honest and productive work for its present city
population unless more industries are started, and
more industries can’t be started unless there is
a market for the goods they produce; and Aus-
tralia can’t find a market for more goods of local
manufacture unless it uses less of foreign manu-
facture. Yet there is a large Freetrarle or
Revenue Tariff party in Australia which promises,
if it wins at next election, that it will reduce the
duties, and that the blessed result will be that
there will be much more foreign goods used and
less local goods, and that there will consequently
be less local industry, and less locally-earned wages
to spend ; and, when the foreign artisan comes
here, he will learn more emphatically than ever
that there is nothing doing in his line. And,
while things are at this pass, the Tory party has
nothing to suggest; it only blathers mechanically
about Labor legislation, and says some gibberish
about something it calls Six Hatters.
Britain’s Sidle Into Protection.
“ In all ranks and in all schools of politics there
is a general awakening to an appreciation of ‘ the
Colonies,’ ” said B. R. Wish in an interview re-
garding British politics the other day. That
explains, in a measure, why that particularly
crafty politician, Chamberlain, fixes upon “the
colonies as a shield behind which Britain may
retreat from its present obviously untenable Free-
trade position. Allowing him full blame for his
selfish opportunism, recollecting that he was
willing to betray a great leader and a great cause
for the sake of personal advancement, and to soak
a great country in blood for personal advertise-
ment, Chamberlain must be credited with a
firm grip of politics, a business-like acumen, and
a gift of foresight (which in his early days first
gained for him prominence as a Radical municipal
statesman). _ He has shown all his cleverness in
the fashion in which he has swung round to the
cause of Protection. For many years now
Britain has steadily decayed under Freetrade!
Its old position of absolute supremacy in trade
and manufacture has been lost, and, in almost
every great department of industrial life, it has
had to sink to a second or third or fourth place
Conquest and annexation, the stealing of great
goldfields and diamond fields, have been its prin-
cipal streak of luck in recent years. Coincidently
with this loss of material prosperity, there
has been a far more serious draining away
of the national stamina. Britain’s lands have
P as ? e l out of cultivation to such an extent
that the old yeomanry” is almost extinct.
I rom a degenerated and neurasthenic population
it finds it almost impossible to secure sailors for
the navy and soldiers for the army of any decent
standard of physical strength. And, withal,
iiritam is faced always with the shuddering dread
of famine in war time # As was the case with
Rome in its decline, Britain’s native lands no
longer produce anything like the quantity of food
necessary for the support of the home population.
Should a great war stop the currents of commerce
shut the seas against grain and meat ships it
alone of the great Powers of the world would
be left in the position of a beleaguered
and unprovisioned fortress. America, France
ussia ’ coul d gather as usual their
home harvests and continue to subsist, suffering
oidy the deprivation of certain luxuries ; BrS
would lack bread and meat and would be brought
a suppliant to the feet of its enemies by sK
hunger. Phis result could almost be arrived
at while Britain s fleets were unconquered • an
alliance of three Powers to stop supplies would
make bread so dear as to be beyond the reach of
tle masses. That is an intolerable position to be

manufacturing industries of that part of the

tralia certainly will not do is to admit British
Empire colored-labor products on preferential
terms, or (unless by the betrayals of our poli-
ticians) give preferences to British goods which
are not .balanced by compensating preferences on
x>ritain s side* If such unfair concessions should
at any time be made, through the pliancy of poli-
eager f ?? I ra P erial favors, it is certain
that they would be short-lived, and liable at
any moment to cancellation by the people,
lhat is the Australian attitude in regard to an
imperial Zollverein, and probably Chamberlain
knows it as well as we do. But the British mind
requires some pretence to justify an abandonment
r .eetrade, other than its own past foolishness,
and if it finds that pretence in the cry of “to
please the colonies,” it is unreasonable for Aus-
tralia to make a fuss. At present, the preferential
xiru I ?> ea d ? es no f really exist in this community.
Whmi Britain has adopted Protection, and is able
to offer preference in return for preference, it will
have some practical life; but not until then.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Freetrade Britain That is and the
Protectionist Britain That Was.
Of late nearly all the space Sydney Telegraph
can spare from its pages of wild demand for
Protection for Freetrade morning papers has been
devoted to a series of lengthy articles about the
horrors of the old Protectionist days in Britain,
and the great improvement that has set in during
later years. Some of its statements are false;
a great many are quite true, only false deduc-
tions are built upon them. During a great part
of_ Britain’s Freetrade period things have cer-
tainly been much better than they were during
part of the Protectionist period, and if Freetrade
had been the only thing that happened, and if the
improvement had been confined to the Freetrade
nation, then it might be fairly assumed that Free-
trade was the cause of the improvement. But there
came into this world in close succession, railways,
telegraphs, steam-boats, thebiggestgolddiscoveries
m all history, the invention of an enormous
number of new labor-saving machines, the prac-
tical discovery of steel —and the Freetrade fetish,
joss or hobgoblin. ' The Freetrader manufactures
his case by the cheerful assumption that steel,
electricity, railways, telegraphs, steam - boats,
labor-saving machinery the great goldfinds of
Australia and California which doubled the
world’s supply of money, did nothing to improve
the world and that Freetrade did everything. All
the comparisons between what Britain was and
what Britain is are based on this ineffably silly
. ■ And the rock on which the lie goes to
pieces is the fact that countries which had
all these material advantages and Protection
made far more progress than the one which
had the same material advantages and Freetrade.


In the old days of the sailing ship, the stage coach,
the hand-loom, and the scanty gold supply, all the
world was poor. Protectionist Britain was
poor, but in manufactures, exports and wealth
it beat the rest of ( the world out of sight. Now,
as the result of the great awakening of invention]
the world is rich by comparison with what it was
in 1830; but Freetrade Britain doesn't lead the
world any longer. The United States beats it
badly in exports, and it is being fast overtaken by
Germany. Britain’s paupers have greatly de-
but those of othercountries have decreased
so much faster that Freetrade Britain is now the
most pauper-ridden country in Europe. It is
beaten in manufactures by Germany and the
United States. It is gradually being overtaken
in the matter of shipping, and the Sydney Tele-
graph’s own London correspondent says that
London is no longer the financial centre
of the world as it used to be. Free-
trade England, with railways, steam-boats,
steel, electricity, and the product of the Aus-
tralian and African gold mines in its coffers,
is a vast deal richer than Protectionist England
was with the old hand-loom and the stage-coach
and no foreign gold mines. But Protectionist
Germany and America, with railways, steamboats,
steel and electricity, are immeasurably further
ahead of what they used to be in the primitive
coach and hand-loom days. Protectionist Britain,
poor as it might be, was indisputably first in
industry —so much first that competition was
nowhere. Freetrade Britain, rich as it may be,
has a desperately hard fight to get a very bad
second place, and bids fair to be third or fourth
before long.

Tittle-Tattle.
When Premier Irvine was eager to get his claws
into the flesh of the Victorian railway men, the
Parliament of his State met and proceeded to
business without the solemn flummery of an
Address-in-Reply debate. Procedure was sim-
plified to dispense with that needless waste of
time. The Governor opened Parliament, announc-
ing what it was summoned for, and members got
to business straight away. It was a bad sort of
business, but the example of sensible alacrity in
method was good. The Federal Parliament had,
at time of writing, wasted a fortnight of a
session, which must of necessity be short, in
solemnly discussing an Address-in-Reply. There
was no reason for the discussion, no value
in it. A mob of scandal-niongering old women
chattering in Catmittee over the characters
of absent friends would have been doing just as
useful work. The only salient points of the
tedious debate were provided by gentlemen
of the Conroy and Pumpkin Smith type,
who contributed their key-hole impressions of
Cabinet Ministers’ private lives gathered
whilst Parliament was out of session. Since
no amendment of the Address was at any time
suggested, it was, presumably, satisfactory to
the members, who should have said “aye” to it
and gone on with business, instead of abusing a
constitutional custom to wander at large in dreary,
discursive, and oftentimes utterly inane, discus-
sion of all sorts of questions. Once upon a
time the right to “ ventilate grievances ” in
debating an Address-in-Reply was of value.
In those days the “King’s speech to his faith-
ful Commons” generally consisted of a demand
for money—that and that only. Then the faith-
ful Commons, in framing a message in reply, indi-
cated a very reluctant willingness to grant the
money, and in debating that message discussed the
grievances which subjects had against the Crown.
If the monarch were wise, he remedied some of
the grievances and the Supply Bill went through.
The necessity for all that flummery has now alto-
gether disappeared, and with the necessity for it
the flummery and its wearisome waste of time
should be abolished. It is not inspiring to see a
national Parliament behaving like a gathering of
old women and solemnly setting itself to a week
or two’s scandal-mongering and purposeless talk
and cat chorus —especially when there is so much
pressing work to be done.
The Unhappy Freetrade Newspapers.
The cool, bracing air of Freetrade still blows on
the Sydney Freetrade newspapers, and-the snug
hothouse in which—protected from outside com-'
petition and warmed with a generous subsidy
from the Treasury—their proprietaries forced divi-
dends to gross bulk, is still barred against them.
So their wailing cries fill the air, and with sturdy *
mendicancy they grind their organs day after day
to the tune of “Pay, Pay, Pay/’ ButtheN.S.W.
Treasury is never likely to be imposed upon by
the wealthy pauper papers again, even though
Carruthers voices his 'full sympathy with their
demands andletsit be understood that, if he should
get into office, their paws can steal to the State
coffers again; for the See Government is beingmade
stronger in, the eyes of the people by the daily
exposure ” of it as a Cabinet which is courageous
enough to undertake, in the interests of good,
government and economy, a task which all pre-
vious administrations shirked. It has done much
to put John See into a favorable position before
the electors that he, whose financial interests in
daily newspapers are probably as great as those
of any man in the State, should have undertaken
to withdraw their subsidies. The previous experi-
ence of William Ltne proved that at least a sec-
tlo,n of the Freetrade press is very amenable
indeed to kindness, and can be blind even
to protectionism, if it is well fed. Un-
doubtedly John See could secure for himself
an equal amount of support, by adopting the
same methods ; and at the same time increase
rnstead of diminishing his newspaper dividends.
I hat he has preferred the honest and courageous
path will not be forgotten by the people
when the time comes for judgment. Need-
less to say, however, the public is not being
assisted to a knowledge of the true facts by the
newspapers whose interests are affected. Even
wilder misrepresentation than usual is being in-
dulged in by the unreliable Telegraph on the
matter. That paper, for instance, industriously
complains that, in addition to imposing quarter
parcel rates on newspapers, the See Government
has, from motives of malice, insisted that each
separate package shall be stamped, instead of the
bulk of the packages being weighed and charged
for. That statement is a mean and malicious
misrepresentation. The fact is that the Freetrade
newspapers object so vehemently to Free-
trade for themselves that they said in the
first instance that they would not pay
even the very much reduced rate which the
Government demanded ; and then, that they
would only pay under protest. The Government,
acting rightly, all will agree, refused to accept
any payments under protest, and until the news-
paper proprietaries agree to pay the rate imposed
(which is the rate that has been for many years
fixed by law, though the papers did not pay it) has
decided to treat them as persons with no credit
account—making them pay in advance as ordinary
members of the community. The decision showed
a disinclination on the part of the Government to
stand any bluff, which must have been infinitely
galling to newspapers accustomed to treat
Premiers as puppets ; but it was quite fair and
business-like. A very encouraging feature
of the controversy is that, so far, all the
efforts of the newspapers to work up an agitation
in their own favor have absolutely failed, and that
public opinion seems to endorse the attitude of
the Government. It would appear that the
minds of the people are not so much enslaved to
press dictation as of old. They are getting to
know their newspapers.

Victoria’s Begging Farmer.
Some day or another there will be in Victoria a
revolt of the city workers against the boundless
arrogance of the squatter and farmer class. This
class lives in a state of constant protest against
State socialism so far as it helps, even in the
remotest degree, the city worker; yet Victoria is
one vast poorhouse, charitable aid scheme and
system of State socialism for the benefit of the
squatter and farmer. Some years ago the State
gave a bonus of 30s. an acre on all lands planted
with vines, in order to encourage the wine in-
dustry —and the city and town worker paid more
than half the bonus. It gave a butter bonus ; it
supplied trees from State nurseries; the State
scent farm sent out flowers and white mulberries
to foster a silk _ and scent industry—and the city
worker paid his share. The sugar beet bonus,
the free seed wheat, and the charity rate for the
carriage of starving stock followed. For all these
things the city worker paid a good half share.
The farmer gets his produce carried at a ridicu-
lously low rate as compared with the pro-
duce of the town manufacturer; he is the sole
cause of the railway deficit. The farmer, by
a huge and shameless process of repudia-
tion, got the bulk of his water-works ex-
penditure charged to the State, and the city
worker pays half of that, in addition to paying
the whole of his own water-works expenditure.
The country local government bodies get subsidies
from the State, of which the town worker pays
half in addition to paying all his own local
government expenditure. The farmer and squat-
ter have almost sole possession of the Upper
House; it is a House in which only con-
siderable landowners are allowed to sit, so
they are qualified for membership while
the city worker is not. They have an absurdly
large share of representation in the Assembly
because the average number of electors to a
member is lowest in the country districts. The
farmer’s class representatives are to be found in
practically every Ministry; the city workers
have only once had a Ministerial representative
of their own order— Tbenwith. The farming
class gets back all it pays to the State as the
purchase price of its land in subsidies, aids,
reduced railway rates and so on—in fact, it gets it
all back twice over, and to all intents and pur-
Eoses it gets its land for nothing so far as the
tate is concerned. It gets the same benefit from
Protection, except in one respect, that the city
bootmaker does ; boots and wheat each
have had the local market preserved for
them, and had to take their chance in the
world’s markets as regards the exported sur-
plus, with the difference that there has been
at various times a bonus—of which the city
worker paid half—on the export of the farmer’s
surplus, while there was never any such aid to the
export of the bootmaker’s surplus. The city
worker has hitherto taken all these things philo-
sophically, but of late the cadging, begging, re-
pudiating farmer has commenced tcrsystematically
hold himself up to public admiration as the strong,
self-reliant man of the community, and to describe
the city worker who pays his bills so uncomplain-
ingly as a person who has subjected the State to
“Trades Hall domination,” and who habitually
preys on a guileless agricultural community. And
this addition of lying and insult to systematic
cadging may yet lead to a definite declaration of
war against the begging farmer and all his aids,
steals, doles and concessions.

“ Good Men at Fifteen Shillings a Week."
The callous principles of the Australian reac-
tionary and alleged Freetrade party are so seldom
set forth in their naked, undisguised brutality
that a journal like the Pastoralists’ Review,
which states these facts in an off-hand, simple-
minded way, does good service to the democratic
cause. Indeed it is difficult to imagine a better
tonic for a languid democrat than a six-months’
course of the squatters’ organ. The May issue of
the Review, which pretty well touches the high-
water mark of Toryism, contains a leading article
on the Vic. railway strike, which, for reckless
mendacity and vindictive ferocity, easily eclipses
anything else written on that unfortunate subject.
The text of the article is the malign influence of
the Labor party, to which the whole of the
trouble is attributed, and the organ of the meek
sheep and the tame cow winds up with the
following scream :
To destroy and demoralise is the only result of their
propaganda, and savagery the practical outcome of their
high-falutin socialism. They have shown themselves in
their right colors as highwaymen, and it has become an
absolute condition for Australia and Maoriland to clear
ourselves of this social pest, in comparison with which
rabbits are a mere circumstance.
That is a pretty good scream in its way, but
another remark in the same issue is almost
better:—
Let anyone think what a boom in station and farm
improvements would take place if good labor were avail-
able at 15s. a week and found.
That statement is, probably, quite true, though a
considerable amount of the labor is even now ob-
tained by the farmer and squatter at 15s. a week
and “found.” But it is pretty certain that there
would be a boom in station and farm improve-
ments if plenty of good labor were procurable for
ss. a week and “found”—or for “found” only.
For that matter, there would be a considerable
boom, even at present wages, if plenty of good
overdraft were obtainable at 1| per cent., or if
farm rents in good country were only is. an acre,
or if the interest on the public debt were reduced
to 1 per cent, by the simple process of refusing to
pay more. The simple creed of the Pastoralists’
Review is : “ What a lot of money we could make
by confiscating it from the other fellow!” And
if the other fellow reads this highwayman’s
doctrine too often he may begin to have similar
ideas of his own.

Irvine’s Claws.
The Bulletin is obliged to confess that it has
not, even yet, done full justice to the infamous
attack on law and order embodied in the Irvine
Strike Suppression Bill. Two of Irvine’s claws
have so far escaped notice—because an original
copy of the Bill was not procurable and it was
necessary to rely on the daily newspapers’
(alleged) full transcription. The daily news-
papers, whether from a desire to suppress facts
damaging to their friend Irvine, or from an
ignorant idea that the matters were unimportant,
suppressed these two claws of the Bill :
(X) (1) In any prosecution for an offence against this Act
a witness shall not in any court or before any justices be
excused from answering any question on the ground that
his answer may incriminate or tend to incriminate
himself.
(2) A witness who answers truly all questions he is by
this section required to answer shall receive from the
court a certificate stating he has so answered, and such
certificate shall be a bar to all criminal proceedings
against such witness in respect to any offence not being
a felony as to which he has been examined.
(XI) The prosecution of any person for any offence
against this Act may be proceeded with before anj’Police
Magistrate at any convenient Court of Petty Sessions or
suitable place notwithstanding that such court or suitable
place is not the nearest to or most easy of access from
the place where the offence was committed.
These provisions make further hash of the British
constitution, about the glories of which Tories
prate so vehemently, and further display Irvine
as a would-be lawless tyrant seeking powers by
which he could gaol anybody, innocent or guilty.
Clause 10 provides that a witness may be forced
to incriminate himself in the witness box after
the much-abused French criminal system and con-
trary to all the traditions of the British Common
Law, which forbids even a policeman seeking to
trap an arrested person into admissions, and
definitely sets forth that “no man shall be
convicted out of his own mouth.” Clause 11
proposes that persons may be sent for
trial anywhere; if it had passed it would have
been only necessary for the Irvine Government to
have intimidated or purchased ONE police magis-
trate in all Victoria, and it could have sent all its
Coercion cases before him and thus made convict-
tion certain. British Common Law provides that
an accused person must be sent for trial to the
nearest court; if a man commits a crime at, say,
Bathurst (N.S.W.), he must be brought before the
local petty court there and committed to quarter
sessions or assizes in the district, unless some other
session is more convenient in point of time, and
venue of trial can only be changed for good reason
shown. For the Crown to be able to select
its court for the trial of offences would endanger
the liberty of every person in the community.
But Irvine proposed that. The Bulletin’s
regret that Irvine did not get his Bill through
increases daily. A month’s enforcement of it
would have made it impossible for the future, in
Australia, for any person to be a Tory without
being shadowed by two detectives and searched
daily for bombs.

Re the Stott tragedy in South Yarra (Vic.). At
the post-mortem examination of Stott’s body, Dr.
Mollison said: “The brain was not an abso-
lutely healthy one. The man had been suffering
from specific disease for some years past, and that
had affected the brain.” The Coroner said that
Stott was “ in a state of incipient general paraly-
sis of the brain, a condition that might have led
him to plan and commit the murder.” Yet the
only witness who had seen anything of him while
alive—and she had known him for six years—
merely thought “ his manner a bit strange.” An
extra drink would have that effect on the manner
of almost any man. The question is this :If
Stott had not committed suicide, and thereby
given the doctors a chance to explore his brain
and find out things, what would have been the
result ? Almost certainly he would have been
hanged. This case makes one wonder how many
men have been hanged who should rather have
been sent to a lunatic asylum. Why not get
down to business by having the brain of every
hanged man, and every murderer who dies
in prison without hanging, dissected by the best
possible experts not attached to the penal depart-
ment. Then let the results be published, and
let the community figure out, so far as the best
available evidence will admit, what proportion of
lunatics it has (or has not) hanged. This would
go some distance towards clearing up a very dark
mystery. At present, even if the hanged mur-
derer’s brain is examined, the medical faculty is
generally as silent as a defunct oyster about the
results, and, if the public has hanged a lunatic—•
well, the public is left in blessed ignorance of the
fact.

A marine officer writes :
Exit steamer Oakland with eleven of her crew. Yet
another name to be added to the long list of foundered
colliers. Doubtless the usual inquiry will be held, and a
finding arrived at that the vessel was, to all intents and
purposes, thoroughly well found and in all respects sea-
worthy when starting on her fatal voyage. Yet the fact
remains that within four hours from leaving her loading
port the vessel became a total loss, the cause being quite
unconnected with the risks usually associated with the
sea-going business—fire, collision, stranding, or break-
down of machinery. Survivors’ accounts state that
shortly after leaving the shelter of Newcastle harbor
the vessel commenced to list heavily to port, rendering
it unmanageable in the heavy sea when the skipper
attempted to make for the shelter of Port Stephens.
The list points to inefficient trimming of the coal cargo
which was on board. For the safe carriage of bulk
cargoes such as coal, grain, etc., efficient trimming is the
chief consideration. With regard to the latter, extensive
legislation exists in Britain, prescribing the quantities
that must not he exceeded in any one , compartment of
the vessel. I am not laying any charges of remissness
against the officials at the coal port, whose duty
it is to see that ships shall not clear the port
overloaded. Since the loss of the Federal, these
latter have been more than usually alert in
examining load lines, both by day and night, previous to
vessels unmooring from loading berths. But cargo
trimming is an item of shipping economy that comes
directly under the master’s supervision; failing him
under that of the next in command. In the coal trade
this important duty is usually placed in the hands of the
foreman who bosses the ’longshore gang of trimmers
engaged for the work, so that his mere word is the
only assurance the master has concerning his vessel’s
seaworthiness so far as her freight is concerned. In
spite of all care, slipshod work will at times occur, more
especially on an occasion like this, where a small vessel
puts in for a few hours to fill up, and leaves in a hurry
towards midnight in order to make her next port by
day. Owners who, through their agents, are willing to
accept these risks have only themselves to blame when
loss occurs, but it is hard on those who have no say in
the matter, that they should have to pay the penalty
with their lives.

Attention has been drawn to three successive
sentences delivered by Judge t CHOMLEY, at Mel-
bourne general sessions. A young man of the
habitually violent order got six months’ hard
labor for inflicting serious knife-wounds upon a
“ pal.” It was his tenth conviction, and the
learned Judge classed him as a brute, hence the
mildness of the punishment, seemingly. The
next on the list was a thief, whose twelfth con-
viction brought him 12 months’ hard labor. Then
came a silly young first offender, pleading guilty
to some small embezzlements. The judgment on
him was 18 months’ imprisonment. The law,
strange to say, doesn’t regard a man’s body as a
valuable property unless the possessor happens to
be rich in other respects. Or, to be strictly
accurate, it isn’t the law so much as the
hopeless aggregate ass who is hired to administer
it. Chomley, by law, could have given a nominal
sentence to the insignificant first offender who
took a trifle of petty cash, and a heavy one to the
brutal ruffian with ten convictions. The mistake
the law made was in giving Chomley so much
latitude, and trusting to Chomley’s discretion
when Chomley hadn’t any. Its second mistake
lies in not speaking severely to Chomley about
the matter afterwards.

The Rev. Hennessey, the new-chum parson of
the Pitt-strest (Sydney) church, who wants to
know what the Labor party thinks of itself for
not reducing the number of pubs in Sydney,
comes from Birmingham, or thereabouts. Now,
the Sydney metropolitan licensing district has
one pub to every 607 mouths ; while Birmingham
has one to every 340. Manchester, in the same
neighborhood, has one to every 214 ; and Liver-
pool isn’t much better. In fact, only two of the
22 larger English centres have fewer than one to
every 500—Leeds and Cardiff. The Rev. Hen-
nessey is wasting himself in Sydney ; he ought to
go, say, to Dudley, where there is a pub to every
55 adults. Lord Dudley, by the way, owns 33
pubs himself ; and he isn’t the biggest noble
landlord by a long way. His Lordship of Derby
has 72 of them. Hennessey speaks with lofty
and pompous severity about the sinfulness of the
N.S.W. Labor party because of the many public-
houses of Sydney, yet Sydney compares remark-
ably well with the place where Hennessey comes
from, and where there is no Labor party in
politics. Will Hennessey tell us what kind of a
fearless, manly reproof he addressed to the Earls of
Derby and Dudley? Or did he think it better
to be respectful to noble British public-house
owners with rich offerings to make?

Premier Balfour on preferential trade :
If by a general tax on foodstuffs it is possible to obtain
from the colonies large measures of Freetrade in manu-
factured goods, I am not sure it would not be worth
while.
No, Balfour, it wouldn't be worth while—not
worth our while. If it is a case of charging a 35
per cent, duty on British goods and 65 per cent,
on Yankee goods, and thus securing to Britain
such orders as we have to give, while still fostering
our own manufactures, there can be little objec-
tion, provided Britain offers a reasonable equiva-
lent. But to destroy our manufactures by Eree-
trade for the sake of getting extra good terms in
England for our own wool when our sheep are
mostly dead; and for our wheat when, through
the drought, we can’t raise enough wheat
to feed ourselves; and for our meat when
our cattle are mostly dry bones—no, Balfour, it
isn’t worth while. And even if there was no
drought, it isn’t worth while to destroy our manu-
factures and resort solely to the most "poorly-paid
occupation on earth—that of dragging raw
material out of the ground for export—with the
chance that Britain may shortly change its mind
again, and throw open its ports once more to all
comers, and leave us just where we were, minus
our manufactures. No, Balfour, it isn’t worth
while to give Britain a large measure of Freetrade
in manufactured goods. It isn’t worth while,
Balfour.
Marulan (N. S. W.) council has passed a resolution
praying the hard-hearted Andrew Carnegie to
come out here with his blood-money and open up
iron works in its district to utilise the local iron
deposits. Wherefore it is advisable to tell this
fool council these three things :
(1) Australia wants to have its iron works owned
locally, and the profits spent in the country. It doesn’t
want its iron deposits used up merely that a foreigner
may go away with a few more millions to spend in
England.
(2) It wants to work out its own salvation—not to be
known as the Great Helpless Beggar Nation which is al-
ways passing the hat or asking some flinty Scotch-
American with a grasping hand and a bagman’s soul to
come and help it.
(3) The best thing Marulan can do is to sack its Free-
trade member Conroy, who votes against Protection or
a bonus for the iron industry, and thereby prevents that
local iron industry being started—and then get to work
itself.

A letter from Seddon’s country :
A small parallel to the Bent-Irvine disfranchisement
of the public service has been talked about again in
Maoriland. One M‘Curdy, employed in the Telegraph
Department, became a leading member of the Maoriland
Farmers’ Union, and on this fact becoming known to
Minister Joseph Ward, M’Curdy was, after several ulti-
mata and defiances, dismissed from the service. At a
social to a recently-elected M.H.R., a Labor leader raised
the M'Curdy question, whereupon Joseph Ward explained
that ever since there had been a Parliament in Maoriland
State employees had not been permitted to take any part
in politics, and that the telegraphist had been rightly dis-
missed. Yet it is not more than three weeks ago since
the Government issued an order that “henceforth no ;
civil servant should take part in politics,” so it seems
rather a new tyranny than an old one. Seddon was
entirely dumb on the matter of the Vic. railway strike.
All that he could be got to say was that it was a pity
it was not settled by arbitration. Of course it was a pity
but when a man has talked so long and so. loudly on all
the subjects upon which man has ever talked Since the '
world began, this thunderclap of silence seemed remark-
able. Seddon has conciliated nobody by his determined
straddling of the fence, and he has alienated the -sym-
pathy of the workers to a very large extent. He seems
to have forgotten almost how to speak about anything
except the sickening silken bonds, and those bonds have
got so disreputable through being pawed by greasy hands
that old man Seddon is hard put to it to make them look
respectable.
The Heart-Breaking Government.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Premier See, in speaking to the deputation from the
unemployed, said that by the end of the week work
would be provided for 500 men at stone-breaking, and
he would make similar provision for 1000 more if neces-
sary. Mr. Carruthers stated that he would not raise
the slightest objection if the Government would start some
permanent public works for the relief of the people.
In dreams I saw the Premier stand
Beside a heap of hearts,
And on his right Owe’Sullivan
Drove up with many carts.
He tipped his drays and gat him hence
Unto the quarry holes,
Whilst John See and his Government
Broke hearts for weekly doles.
And on their left Carruthers stood,
With brain and pockets void ;
He was, he said, the Leader of
The Sydney Unemployed.
But See’s big hammer rose and fell
And brake more hearts in twain,
What time Carruthers’ anguished yell,
Did greet his ear in vain.
He cried “ Pray let me earn my bread
At hammering the hearts ” ;
And then unto Owe’Sullivan —
“ Pray let me drive your carts.”
But lo ! the Driver shook his head
And pointed unto See,
Who pointed to Owe’Sullivan,
Then brake on earnestly.
And when I woke, Carruthers still
Sobbed loud by fits and starts,
Whilst John See and his Government
Still brake the piles of hearts.

loudly as at an excellent joke, while the other was
savage at being made fun of when he only wanted
“ a serious answer.”

Patriotism Exalteth a Nation.
This may not be quite orthodox, but it is nevertheless true. It is also afact that in N.S.W.
patriotism is sadly lacking in its people. Parochialism and selfishness are rampant every-
where-in Parliament and People. Instead of AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURED GOODS
or equal merit to.the Foreign-made Article being preferred, they are only taken if CHEAPER*
The very men who cry the loudest, “ AUSTRALIA FOR THE AUSTRALIANS !/’-even to
the extent of keeping out the English Hatters—are those who, from pure prejudice, call
ror the roreign-made Article in preference to the Australian production. This is not the
spirit that prevails in America, and which has made it the greatest country on the face or
the earth. There nothing is good unless it is “ ’Murkan,” and so it must be here if we are
to become a Nation. The Rosewarne Packing Co., Limited, have lately added to the other
branches of their canning business the manufacture of Potted Ham and other Meats, in

The “Runaway Girl,” who came back to
Sydney last Saturday night, for one week only,
made her appearance with an assembly of such
excellent extremities and with so charming a girl
in the name part that The Bulletin left its
alleged intellect in the cloak-room. There was
only one really knock-kneed girl visible in the
crowd, a discerning stage-manager having evi-
dently exercised care that the inferior sup-
ports of the crowd were kept in the back-
ground. So graceful were the visible understand-
ings that the show struck this writer as a sort of
religious ceremony. On the whole, the present
production of the “ Girl ” is a much more pleasing
entertainment than the former uprising of the
same piece at the same house some months
ago. The former people could sing better,
but they made it big, garish and aggressive.
The Dagoes loomed larger in it, and when the
Girl fled the convent Florence Young dressed her
hideously in the sort of costume the unpoetic
Maori wahine wears when she smokes a short
clay pipe on the step of a public-house. Also,
Lauri made Flipper an arrogant bounder, and
Carrie Moore represented Alice as a forward
hussy. The play is essentially a play for little
people, and Fred. Graham, Miss Lillian Digges,
and Miss Rose Musgrove seem better suited to
their parts. Miss Digges, in the name part, plays
in a girlish, natural way that gives the whole
weird business an air of probability ; she makes it
a sort of silly school girl escapade that has some
human interest in it. Unfortunately, the airy
little girl was handicapped on Saturday by
a severe cold, which did not, however,
detract from the charm of her acting.
Fred Graham’s Flipper is a low-spirited wit bear-
ing up bravely against the depression caused by
a new job which he knows nothing about. As a
member of-tiie peerage, Arthur Lissant is superb ;
his dignified bearing and his mixture of hauteur
and affability prove that Arthur is “nobly
born.” It is quite refreshing to see a man who is
obviously of noble birth representing the peerage
on the stage as to the manner born. The “Run-
away Girl,” as already hinted, is on for one week
only. On Saturday it will be replaced by the
“ Belle of New York,” which may fairly claim to
be the best and most musical of the musical come-
dies now oiA deck.
** * *
At Sydney Lyceum. Wm. Anderson is now
nightly offering two murders, a bad case of d.t’s.,
some vitriol throwing, a palace and a dosshouse,
a cathedral and Monte Carlo, a fashionable wed-
ding, a Russian Count, a duel, and a host of
sundries too numerous to particularise. The hero,
who is Inman, is married twice; and the house
that wants its hero married more than twice in
one evening is a Turk and no Englishman.
“Man’s Enemy” is One of the pieces on which
the management builds its hopes of future sal-
vation ; all four acts are sprinkled with disserta-
tions on the awfulness of drink. (But, alas for
man’s inconsistency, you turn from the
stage with the half-formed determination to
henceforth wear the blue ribbon of a dry life,
and you find on your programme a cordial
encouragement to drink Boggins’s beer and
Somebody’s brandy by day, and schnapps at bed-
time.) Whether, however, the moral of “Man’s
Enemy ” is quite as good as it looks on the sur-
face isn’t clear ; anyway, Harry Staunton, who
does the heaviest drinking, winds up with a
magnificent wedding, while something terrible
happens to all the cool, calm people who don’t
take liquor. This is a good melodrama, for all
that. Saturday night, when it was first put on, a
packed house yelled its joy ; and when one of the
villains looked like escaping, the hero was warned
from half-a-dozen parts of the house, a pretty
good proof that it is “thrilling and realistic.”
Robert Inman (hero, who drinks), Stirling Whyte
(elderly, hero, who doesn’t), and Miss Guildford
(adventuress, who doesn’t, and gets murdered
with a poker) have heavy work, and do it well ; L.
Dunbar (adventurer, who doesn’t drink, and looks
like getting hanged at 11 o’clock) and Miss Gorrick
(heroine, who marries the hero after the bad
woman who is killed with the poker has done
with him) do reasonably well; and B. Bailey and
Ethel Buckley supply clean, creditable comedy,
in conjunction with a beery gentleman with very
long and very uncertain legs. It is a thrilling
bill and a piece which hangs together better
than most of that kind, and it will last for a week
or so more.
** * *
“The Gay Parisienne,” served up to
crowds of affluent people in the evening dress of
immaculate respectability at Sydney Criterion by
the Waverley Musical Society, is run by two
people of unusual ability, several more of
reasonably fair quality, and a large num-
ber of dreary mediocrities —dreary even from
an amateur standpoint. As the dainty little
adventuress, Julie Bon-Bon, Miss Lily Delany
was simply scrumptious in her short red frock,
with its four tiny flounces, and the hat, the red
ribbons of which tied so trickily under her chin.
To see her trip across the stage in that short
frock was the Sort of sight the Sultan
dreams he will see among the houris
of Paradise but when she came out in
an ordinary long frock, a street frock, with a
train on it, she slumped with a slump to which
that of Chillagoe was but a slide. W. J. Curtis, ' ■
as Ebenezer Honeycomb, the sanctimonious hum- |
bug, was seen to much better advantage when he
donned the red whiskers and kilts of guilty dis-
guise. Harold Curtis, as the French spy, was un-
usually good also, and Mr. Loughlin had about the
best-looking pair of legs writer ever saw on a man.
The successful girl of the piece, however, was
Miss Boyd, as Ruth, the candid servant. She
was a very large success, and her comedy business
was much better than that of many professionals
who are regularly lauded by the theatrical critics.
Miss Stratford played Mrs. Honeycomb as that
severe and nagging lady should be played.
Several other people deserve lengthy notices, but
in mercy they will be omitted.
*# * *
Sydney Tivoli did very well during a week
in which loyal Australians have been having a
somewhat racketty time, in honor of the birthday
of a Duke who probably, poor fellow, can’t have
a racketty time on his own for various reasons.
The Boissetts (whose final Sydney performance is
to-night—Thursday) contribute a new pantomime
which is rather better than their former work, and
the “ Bikerena ” races between various cycling
champions are interesting without being fatal.
To be interesting without being fatal is a great
art in the bike arena.
*# # #
Miss Maggie Moore, fresh in voice and
young in face, handicapped only by an Italian
prima-donna figure, had a warm welcome back to
Sydney on Saturday and Monday last, when she
staged the familiar “Struck Oil ” at the Palace.
It is not a very robust drama, and has to be eked
out with a good deal of song and variety business,
and in that Miss Moore is thoroughly at home.
Her voice is still a great deal superior in tone and
quality to that of many a nowadays comic opera
star. Mr. Forde, as John Stofel, gives adequate
support, both in the humorous and pathetic
scenes ; other members of the co. have little to
do, and do it without obvious discomfort.
** * *
At Melbourne Princess’s the first week of
“As You Like It’’left it an open question whether
Melbourne would really warm to this beautifully
illustrated revival of a play which has hitherto
been more honored in the speech than the
observance. Previous revivals were more talked
of than looked at. This is a glorified edition of
the same old work. The pictures are the finest
ever staged; a capital orchestra makes music
whilst the curtain is down, and during much of
the time when it is up: the entertainment as a
whole appeals to all who will come along and take
it quietly. But for the public that finds sermons
in race-cards, books in the babbling bars, tongues
in football barrackers, and “rot” in everything—
for them Shakspeare’s unexciting comedy has no
attraction beyond the bloomin’ wrestling match,
which is a put-up job. Nevertheless “As You Like
It” drew a big attendance last Saturday night, and
the merits of Musgrove’s plucky venture will
doubtless force a certain amount of patronage.
The ginger that made “ The Dream ” palatable to
the multitude is lacking in this play, yet the
taste for poetic spectacle, here and there developed
by the more pungent production, will count for
something now and evermore.
* * * •
In some respects, the performance im-
proves on acquaintance; in other respects, it
grows rather irritating. Though Miss Nora
Kerin is an absolutely ideal Rosalind on occa-
sion, her acting is often perfunctory. She
walks through the part like an intelligent
angel forgetting to put her heart into it.
Miss Dora Rignold, on the other hand, is
earnest, and in the first act (where Celia gets
many of the lines usually purloined by Rosalind)
her sympathetic manner and rich voice are very
effective. For that matter, both girls are more
convincing in the first act than in the forest
scenes. Norman Partridge, as Orlando, is the
artistic antithesis of Miss Kerin. When he talks
in a seeming casual way he is at his best —he cer-
tainly achieves naturalness where Kyrle Bellew
didn’t. But when he dwells upon his elocution
he is just Partridge—game Partridge. Fortu-
nately, he has the recommendation of being a
young, athletic man—distinctly young, although
he looks older than his age, and brings his hair
forward in odd kiss-curls on his forehead. Wicked
brother Oliver is carefully and picturesquely
played by J. Holding, whose performance in
“The Dream” showed steady improvement.
Oliver, all the same, is one of the most improbable
of Shakspearian circumstances. He has no sooner
repented of his sin (off the stage) than he
bewitches a duke’s daughter by merely mention-
ing how wicked he was half-an-hour ago, and lo !
the smitten pair get married to-morrow. The two
dukes are satisfactory in their respective manners,
for the exiled potentate seems a mild, gentle-
manly old person, born to get ousted from a soft
billet by a more ambitious relative, whilst the
usurper is a combative little tyrant, with a bold,
disinheriting nose, and when he talks death to
Rosalind he sounds dangerous. This evil
duke, like the wicked Oliver, gets, or be-
comes, suddenly virtuous, and his conversion,
like Oliver’s, happens behind the sceues. In
last week’s paragraph The Bulletin spoke of
an appalling messenger who disfigured the final
scene by bringing glad tidings of the ducal con-
vert. He was the other Jaques (Shakspeare care-
lessly slipped two of them into the one story), and
through a mistake in fitting the names of the
actors to a telegraphed notice it happened that the
wrong Jaques, after being denounced as a calamity,
got credit for being the respectable Jaques, played
by Alfred Bucklaw. The same error couldn’t
recur, for the wrong Jaques was mercilessly cut
out of the caste on the next night. Three small
parts —Leßeau, Corin and Sylvius—are well filled.
Charles Denny’s Touchstone has an air of genu-
ineness which Miss Milton’s Audrey has not,
and Kenningham makes a tuneful Amiens’.
Somehow as Amiens he strikes a note of modem
I comic opera in the Forest of Arden.
#* * *
' At Melbourne Royal, where Bland Holt
reigns, the last night of “The Price of Peace”
was Saturday, and on Sunday the House of
Commons buried Premier Baker, K.G., with full
Parliamentary honors. On Monday that expan-
sive Australian pastoral and Sydneycal drama,
“The Breaking of the Drought,” was to point
its morals at a Melbourne audience for the first
time. Local remarks on the bush fire, the thirsty
soil, and the lamb that went astray are deferred
until next week. “The Drought” having been
often discussed in The Bulletin during its long
Sydney season, the necessity for further com-
ment is not very urgent.
i** * *
• Sheridan and co., back in Melbourne after
an absence of more than a year, made a promising
start at the Bijou on Saturday night. “The
Lady Slavey,” described as a comic operatical
comedy, seems to be, firstly, an ancient panto-
mime fable in modem burlesque form, and,
secondly, a variety show appertaining thereto.
It might be summed-up as musical comedy for the
million, or a reminiscent nightmare at popular
prices. Also the manager who billed it as
“ Cinderella-up-to-Date ” would have good and
sufficient reason for his advt. The one startling
novelty in Sheridan’s latest Melbourne out-
break has been previously referred to by
this journal. He gets through his share
of the proceedings without once lapsing
into long skirts. For a few brief moments he
abandons his trousers, and presents an alarming
appearance of pale-pink legs, but the skirt he
wears at this crisis is a masculine Scotch kilt,
more or less. Otherwise Sheridan is a bailiff, a
flunkey, or a spurious millionaire, and the verdict
of posterity will probably decide that he was best
as a bailiff. Another bailiff, played by Went-
worth in a broken spirit of former great-
ness, is likewise a humorous character, whilst
an orthodox tow-headed idiot is passably
perpetrated by Sydney Carden. Miss Mavis, in
the name part, and several other people (mostly
ladies) introduce songs and dances. Some of the
singing was not strictly tuneful on Saturday, but
seemed likely to improve. Moreover, the audi-
ence encored it for what it was worth, and the
general efforts of the principals and chorus,
assisted by two neat backgrounds and a small
energetic orchestra, will probably satisfy Mel-
bourne’s chronic want.
** * *
“Secret Service,” the workmanlike drama
from America, has put Daniel Frawley and Co. on
good business terms with the Melbourne populace,
and if the present season was not limited to six
weeks the nightly discomfiture of the evil Yankee
patriot by the virtuous Confederate spy would
continue a while longer. Under the circumstances
it looks better policy to change the bill next Satur-
day (13th) when a new version of “Madame Sans
Gene” will take the floor with Frawley as
Napoleon, and Miss Van Buren as the plump and
genial Madame who beards the Daniel in his den.
** * #
At the Opera House the departure of
well-beloved Rudinoff and the arrival of the
Boissett pantomimists didn’t eventuate last week,
as threatened. It is happening this week. Also
the first appearance of an eccentric juggler will
take place on Saturday, and in the meantime the
popular firm of J. W. Win ton and M'Ginty is
helping to cover Rudinoff’s retreat.
** * *
Mark Hambourg created a farewell furore
in Melbourne last Monday and is now en route to
Maoriland with Brother Boris and Lemmone. A
forthcoming musical visitor to Melbourne is a
young lady violinist from Bendigo, whose first
concert at the Town Hall has been announced for
Saturday.
»* * *
The Musgrove Opera Co. is coming to a
bright and glorious conclusion at Adelaide Royal,
Lempriere Pringle and the Slapoffski having come
back for the final week. Piddock and Josephine
Stanton sing well in “The Thirty Thieves,” the
former apparently modelling his style upon
Wallace Brownlow. Also Shirley and Courte-
nay are a capable pair, but Edward Lauri
and May Beatty do most of the hard work.
The Tivoli has reopened with George Wil-
loughby in “Mistakes Will Happen,” and
the rollicking, if sometimes rather mechanical
humors surrounding the gentleman who had to
go away because he Annoyed the Dog are sufficient
to fill the small house. The Town Hall has been
packed by Edward Branscombe’s Westminster
Abbey concert party, including five highly-trained
small boys, whose flute-like .voices take the
Adelaide public in a tender spot. The party
came from Tasmania, and has now gone west; it
will be heard in the eastern capitals a little later.
By the way, a “society entertainer,” who forms
a part of it, introduces in one of his sketches the
old “accompanied byjthe curate” chestnut, sub-
dued to drawing-room flavor; and the daily
papers acclaimed it specially as a marvel of
originality and wit !
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Whenever Australia is told that alreadv it
£56 of public debt per head while Great Britainhas <TnW
£lB odd and many other countries not even that mnl 7
the inevitable answer is that the comparison <Wt
a PPIy.. because Australia owns its own railways Th.
truth is that about £35 of the total of £56 has been scent
on railways ; so that, even apart from railways the Zlll
is £2! per head which is a great deal mor'e ’than th
British debt. And many countries which also own
own railways owe very little indeed. In Australia’s case
too, a good deal of this £35 isn’t represented by railway
any longer, but only by rust, and year by year the An
way becomes less while the rust becomes more vet in.
debt becomes larger because the interest isn't wholly
paid out of revenue, but to a considerable extent
indirectly out of further loans. Nearly all our borrowing
has been done within the last 20 years ; for everv fu
debt that we had incurred in 1880 we now have £3los Th
greaterpart of our publicworks are therefore almostnew-
up to now, by patching(in many cases done with more loan
money) the works still pass for new and as beintr worth
cost price Yet there is a point at which patching *
not hide the truth or serve its purpose, just as ther! j, .
time inevitably when the composition will no longer keen
the water out of the rusted ship. g. Australia was the
other day given a glimpse of these unpleasant
facts. A railway commission is sitting there and
the Engineer-in-Chief was asked to account for the
large maintenance expenses. He answered that
the older and worse the line, the heavier the’
expense needed to keep it tratficable. To carry the
Barrier traffic 401 b. rails had been laid ; in many cases
these had been worn out and 501 b. rails had been put in
“ But,” the Engineer-in-Chief added, “the time will come
when the whole line will have to be relaid, for which no
provision has yet been made. There will be a day of
reckoning some day in the future.” A day of reckoning
—it will be no name for what is coming ! For theposition
is something like this :
(1) We borrow money and build railways with it and
they don’t pay the interest.
(2) We borrow more money to patch the railways: and
as the interest is now larger the railway deficit is also
larger.
(3) We borrow money to pay up part at least of the
railway-interest deficits; and, as the interest is now
larger than ever, the deficit becomes larger than ever
(4) We borrow more money to relay the railways.
And when that happens we have four lots of loans
in respect of a railway that wouldn’t pay interest on
even one lot when it had only that much to do ; and we
have taken practically the same line of railway to the
pawnshop four times.

In 1875, just when N.S. W. was starting its bor-
rowing policy on a large scale, it went to London for a mil-
lion pounds, offering 4 per cent. It actually got £894,700.
This loan is now falling due, and the State is raising
another million to pay it back. This time it hopes to
get something like £987,000. On the two transactions it
thus loses £llB,3oo—it owes £1,000,000 though it only
received £881,700. For the £894,700 which it formerly
raised it has already paid £1,120,000 in interest, and
it still owes the million; and as that million is
now costing another £13,000, the original £894,700 has
really cost £1,133,000, with a million still to pay. What
has become of the first million, or rather the first
£894,700, nobody remembers now ; the chances are that
what it bought was thrown out on the scrap heap 10 or
15 years ago. The only thing that remains as good as
new is the debt. But if N.S.W. in 1875 had decided to
set aside out of revenue £40,000 a year for public works
instead of £40,000 a year interest on a £1,000,000 public
works loan, it would have far more public works than it
has now, and it wouldn’t owe the £1,000,000 it owes now,
and it wouldn’t have to pay the £40,000 a year it pays
now. The result of that one small loan is the same as if
£1,133,000 had been thrown into the deep sea.

The Illawarra Steam Navigation Co., which
is at present a proprietary concern, proceeds with a
scheme of reconstruction with a view to registration.
There are at present 16,599 shares of £5 paid to £3 10s.
(£58,096), and on March 31, 1903, the nominal reserves
were £26,991. The plan of reconstruction most likely to
be adopted is to issue five £1 shares paid to 15s. for each
existing share, and pay a liquidation dividend of 10s. per
share. Of the reserves, about £4691 will be written off.
It is some years since anything substantial has been
written off; too high a dividend has been maintained
to allow of that being done. Now £4691 goes off at once.

In the published statements the rents from Harbor fore-
shore resumptions are included, although a great part
of the purchase money has not yet been paid. Excluding
this item, therefore, the position is as stated above; in-
cluding it, it is as below :

Inc. £36,119 Inc. £394,037 Inc. £357,918
This is bad enough ; yet the first statement of the case,
which is worse, is undoubtedly the more correct.
Further, there are other items which are not yet charged,
but will yet come in—repayments and charges to
suspense accounts—and these will add a substantial
amount to the deficit. How the year will end it is im-
possible to say. Revenue for June is usually heavy,
mainly through income-tax payments ; but the ordinary
expenditure for May was so unusually small that it looks
as though the payments for the current month (June) will
have to be extra heavy to make up for it. Even
crediting the State with the Harbor rent fakes, the 1902-3
deficit is certain to rank with the very worst—with the
£582,288 of the disastrous 1892-3 period (the period of the
bank smashes) and with the Reid deficit of £607,523 in
1896; and it would have been worse still but for the
unexpectedly large surplus derived from the Australian
Customs, to a great extent as the result of the honest
administration of that department. The loan expenditure
is looking more respectable ; on the last five momns
there has been a decrease of £987,584 as compared witn
the same months of the previous year. For the u
months the position is :

The Wilfley Concentrator is probably the most
successful piece of mining machinery ever introduced.
In 1897 it was first brought out as a novelty, and in 1903
is regarded as an absolute necessity in the plant of every
mine requiring to concentrate its ores. Over 5000 of the
machines have been sold, and upwards of 600 mines have
it in use all over the world, while in the Commonwealth
of Australia above 500 machines are now working on 120
mines. Thirty million tons of ore are being treated
annually by the above tables; probably more than equal
to the combined ore tonnage of all other makes of
concentrators. The Wilfley is the only concentrating
table in use at the Great Anaconda Copper Mines where
431 tables are now at w'ork. Particulars and catalogues
can be obtained on application to the sole Australian
Manufacturers, the Austral Otis Engineering Co., South

As the Brjulder (W.A.) municipality wished to
extend the town to the west of the railway line, an
interview took place (May 26) with Minister of Mines
Gregory, at which manager Hamilton, of Great Boulder ;
manager Sutherland, of Golden Horseshoe ; and manager
Nicholson) of Ivanhoe, were present. Mr. Hamilton
pointed out that “ this ground contained the deep levels
of the existing lodes, and was the locality which
would have the most work done on it in future. The
Kalgoorlie Consols had of late had additional prospective
value given to it through the Ivanhoe Junction’s new
leases having come so much under notice.” Mr. Nichol-
son said that “ the Ivanhoe Co. intended spending about
£35,000 on machinery, and would be doing a lot of
diamond drilling on the Crescent leases (late Ass.
Southern). The Kalgoorlie Consols had an equally good
chance of doing well” Mr. Sutherland said that “ his
co. had been compelled to purchase 62 acres (Golden
Treasure) for £15,000, but had not spent that money
merely to use the land for a dump. They had acquired
that area because of mining possibilities in connection
with it, and it was a very valuable lease.” These, then,
are the opinions of the three leading W.A. mine managers
on what were long considered wild cats. Mr. Gregory
supported them and refused the Boulder Council’s
request.

With the nominal surplus (now £281,980) Queensland
will have to try to pay £748,000 for interest at the end of
the current month. The current month’s collections will
be considerably ahead of expenditure, unless something
altogether out of the way happens ; so that in the end
Queensland willprobably wind up with a shortage of about
£350,000. In plain English, about that much of the
interest bill will have to be paid out of money borrowed
from somewhere or other. Still, that will not be quite as
bad as was expected at one time ; the figures for May
like those for April, show a good, solid improvement!

The large increase in the month’s revenue is due to the
collection of the new income and poll tax. The total
expenditure of loan funds for the 11 months is £824,589
as compared with £1,024,160 for the same part of 1901-2.

These are nearly the most exciting figures of the whole
collection. At the end of March there was a surplus of
£290,105 ; at the end of April it had got down to £188,178
Every item, almost, is unsatisfactory. Revenue ’ has
fallen, expenditure has jumped in a most remarkable
manner, and the month shows altogether one of the
worst deficits in the State’s historv. April, 1903, shows
by comparison with April, 1902, this way

South Australia furnishes only quarterly
returns, and the last quarter closed on March 31 with a
deficit of £53,082 as against a deficit of £165,796 for the
corresponding part of 1901-2. It is more than likely that
the deficit will disappear, and that a small surplus
will be shown. In land and income taxes, from which
£215,000 was expected for the year, onlv £111,644 was
received in the first nine months ; and as the full amount
expected from these duties should be realised, while
expenditure is still being strictly curtailed, there are
strong probabilities that Butler, farmer and Treasurer
will come out square. ’

The great slump in the month’s returns is due very
largely to the fact that the Commonwealth Govt, having
had very large payments to make during May, there was
nothing worth speaking of to return to the State, as
against an average of about £26,500 per month for the
earlier months of the year.

The co. carries a heavy mortgage (£64,000), on which
£2261 interest was paid during the year—equal to some-
thing over 7 per cent, on the co.'s capital. Year by year
hitherto something has been paid off this, but nothing
can be done in that way this year. Apparently the rate
of interest has now been put up ; anyway, on top of its
other misfortunes, the co. has had to pay out a larger
sum under this head than for several years past, not-
withstanding that the principal has been reduced from
£70,000 in 1899 to £64,000 from the beginning of last
year. This circumstance will probably make’ the co.
more anxious than ever to shift the burden.

The insurance fund is now £3,382,817. In addition to
this there is an investment fluctuation fund, provided as
set out above, and also a tontine savings fund, thelatter
kept separate from the general fund until it matures.
The Investment Fluctuation Fund has been operated
upon as follows during the past few years :

1898 .. 965 27,685
On account of the tontine business the figures with regard
to the expense rate are liable to be erratic. In 1901, for
instance, the rate was depressed through the passing of
the No. 1 tontine fund, then matured, into the general
funds. But for that fact the figures for 1902 would look
even better than they do in the following table :
Expenses in Proportion to Total Income.
1893 .. £l4 19 0 per cent. 1898 .. £l4 610 per cent.

1897 .. 14 17 2 „ „ 1902 .. 13 65 „ „
This is, considering the size of the business, an unusually
low rate, No privately managed office of corresponding
age and size shows anything like such good results. The
A.M.P.’s rate for last year was, it is true, £8 14s. Od. per
cent. ; but, then, the A.M.P. has now an income of over
2£ millions a year. The Colonial Mutual, with a business
more nearly equal to the Maoriland State Department’s,
has lately brought its expense rate down to £lB 17s. sd. ;
the Mutual Life Association, with not quite two-thirds of
the income, stands at £l9 9s. lOd.; and of the three large
offices doing business in Australia the Equitable’s
(£lB Is. 5d.) is lowest.

1896 419 0 „ 1901 4 8 8 ,
1897 416 7 ~ 1902 4 8 6 „
This is on the average of the insurance fund alone. In-
cluding the average of the investment fluctuation fund
(which would be the correct course, seeing that that
fund is presumably earning interest) the rate is
£4 7s. sd. against £4 7s. Bd. for 1901, and £4 Bs. 3d. for
1900. The total annual amount of interest earned has
increased from £108,098 in 1893 to £147,486 in 1902,
showing an increase of 37 per cent, for the decade.
During the year a valuation (on a 3J per cent, basis) of
the M.L. State Life Insurance Department’s liabilities was
made ; and, after allowing for the transfer of £22.783 to
the Investment Fluctuation Fund, a surplus of £168,408
was disclosed. Of this amount £167,934 has been dis-
tributed on what is known as the compound reversionary
bonus plan, members in the general section receiving
bonus additions to their policies of 1 per cent, calculated
on the sum assured and existing bonuses. The effect
of this plan is to make the bonus addition the larger the
longer the policy has been in force. The aggregate
additions to policies in the 32 years of the Department’s
life now reach £1,919,820.
Accident insurance is a new branch of
the Maoriland Government Insurance Department,
authorised by an Act of 1899. Capital is provided for to
the extent of £25,000, which may be raised by debentures
or stock carrying a sinking fund provision. The funds,
it is also provided, are to be kept wholly apart from those
of the life department. To the end of December, 1902, it
had been necessary to raise only £lOOO. Present position

The A. A. Company, after 79 years’ blood-
sucking, is preparing to scuttle out of N.S.W. What a
time there was in England when the great scheme of
exploiting Australia took hold of the public ! Members
of Parliament, the governor and several directors of the
Bank of England rushed for shares. George IV. was
King, and was, it is said, with difficulty restrained from
gambling in the shares under a fictitious name. There
was a small leaven of political honesty in the speculation,
which accounts for the names of such men as Joseph
Hume and Lord Brougham on the lists. Indeed, the
promoters put it forward as a patriotic and philanthropic
scheme, representing that capital and population were
needed in Australia, and that the company would supply
both. Commissioner Bigge, who had visited Australia,
was the originator, and continued for years head and
front of the enterprise. The scuttle out is caused by the
land-tax, the threatened progressive land-tax, and the
imminent absentee-tax.

There has been a marked steady fall in the
Sydney Hydraulic shares (amounting to about 40 per

Luck or judgment? A farm of 500 acres in
S.A.’s “ middle north,” about 80 miles up from Adelaide,
changed hands twelve months ago at £3 an acre. The
purchaser cut all the wheat crop for hay, got 300
tons, and has sold it at £5 a ton —getting back just the
price of the land out of the crop the other fellow had
planted.

Whitaker Wright’s alleged anxiety to prove
his financial purity in London criminal court soon re-
solved itself into an earnest desire to keep himself in
America, out of harm’s way. His application for a habeas
corpus writ was refused by the U.S. Supreme Court
last week. Whitaker must now be pretty darned sorry
that he didn’t rush back to England in a fume of virtuous
indignation and hammer at the frontdoor of the criminal
court, demanding to be tried and acquitted at the court’s
earliest convenience. The prisoner who needs to be
dragged away from a habeas'corpus application doesn’t
present a dignified figure of innocence, anyhow. He
looks too like a wild cat being fetched along backwards
by its tail.

The position is probably better than these figures would
suggest. The profits for the two terms of 1902 were
swollen by an item, “ surplus by revaluation,” while the
profit for the past half-year has been depressed by an
item “Special provision for depreciation and income-tax,
£215.” The exact nature of this latter item isn’t apparent.
Probably the depreciation ought not to be charged to the
half-year’s expenses, but, as the two things are mixed,
the only possible course has been followed and the whole
item has been charged. Stripping the profits for the pre-
ceding terms of the revaluation surplus, and omitting
the depreciation, etc., item from last half-year’s accounts,
the earnings would show like this April 1902, £B9l ;
Oct.' 1902, £1069 ; April 1903, £904. On a previous
occasion the spectacle of a pawn-office, with its own
property in pawn to somebody else, struck this paper as
peculiar. A change has now been made ; the old mort-
gage has disappeared, the necessary amount to cause the
disappearance having turned up in the shape of deposits.
A permanent reserve fund is, however, still missing. •
Bewick, Moreing and Co., the English mining
engineers, are said to be directing attention to N.S.W. as
a field for their monopolistic enterprise. Mount Boppy,
near Cobar, by its consistently high average yields and
excellent all-round prospects, has excited their envy, and
they are supposed to be negotiating for its purchase.
Shareholders will be foolish to let them have a finger in
the pie. Co. is moderately capitalised—£llo,oo0 —and
with the additional plant which it is proposed to erect,
the mine will return large profits for many years to come.
B.M. & Co., to assert their superiority as mining
engineers, would probably want to remodel the whole
system of working and equipment, and would require
that the capital be trebled to give them the slice which
would be adequate to represent their eminent services,
the result of all which might be that a rattling good
show as it is would be converted into an indifferent
one as far as profits are concerned. Mount Boppy is the
only survivor of the wreck of the Eissler-governed Anglo-
Australian Exploration Co. —by the way, it is the show
of which for a long time Eissler thought the least —and
as the shareholders in that otherwise unlucky corporation
look to it to retrieve some part of their losses, no offer
which the avaricious B.M. and Co. crowd may make is
likely to tempt them. Another property which B.M. and
Co. are reported to be anxious to have a shot at is the
Mount Bulga copper-mine, near Orange. This they may
command on their own terms. It is owned by a Mel-
bourne syndicate, whose members think such a lot of it
that they are afraid to work it on anything like
a large scale on their own account—they evidently
dread becoming rich all of a sudden, as they would
undoubtedly do if the mine were anything approaching
what their fancy paints it. Melbourne papers state that
B.M. and Co. offer to take the mine on a 12 months’
option, paying £3OOO cash, and undertaking to spend
£7OOO, and, if results are satisfactory', to form a co. with
a capital of £250,000, of which £50,000 is to be working
capital. One-third of the shares are to go to the present
syndicate. This is unadulterated bosh. B.M. and Co.
are not such innocents at the game as to put up £3OOO
for the privilege of spending £7OOO to determine whether
or not a prospecting show is good enough to form into a
£250,000 co., of which local people are to take one-third.
If B.M. and Co.’s expert examination proves the property
to be only half as good as some of the people associated
with it say it is, they may handle it, but on very different
terms from those quoted.

Cobar Chesney mine has been about the best
profit-earner in N.S.W.—for experts. All sorts and con-
ditions of men have been commissioned to report upon
it, and the aggregate of fees paid to them would be quite
enough to equip an ordinary mine. The result, apparently,
is that the owners are left just as much in doubt as they
were at the outset, and it has been found necessary to
have another report. This time Mr. Dyson, late manager
of the Lloyd mine, Burraga, is the lucky man. That
gentleman is undoubtedly well qualified to give advice as
a metallurgist, but getting such advice is like putting the
cart before the horse. What is wanted at the Chesney
mine is perfection of the mechanical arrangements for the
concentration of the ore. The old hope that the massive
ore body would become less siliceous and more heavily
charged with iron as depth was attained has not been
realised. The ore as it exists is not amenable to any
process of direct smelting, and the problem is how best
to deal with it mechanically to produce a smeltable mix-
ture. The best expert advice which can be offered to the
Chesney people is to apply some common-sense—blended,
of course, with some capital. The Melbourne men, who
principally own the show, are not men of straw, nor are
they devoid of enterprise or faith in the mine. Why not,
then, provide the needed cash and give manager Wool-
cock a chance to show what he can do in the way of con-
centration ? Let him succeed with that, and the rest is
simple. Anyhow, it is time that monkeying with this
unquestionably valuable property was discontinued. It
is the worst example in N.S.W. of meddle and muddle.

The.low ebb to which gold-mining has come in
N.S.W. is shown in the official statement that the gold
yield for May is only a trifle over 10,000 oz. Of this
amount the Cobar district must have contributed at least
three-fifths. Of the balance, Wyalong ought to account
for one-fifth, so that a beggarly 2000 oz. is all that is won
in the rest of the vast State dotted all over with mining
camps. Ordinary newspaper reports indicate a gleam of
hope in connection with reef-mining in the Forbes dis-
trict ; but, as a rule, these reports are not to be regarded
seriously. The average local correspondent does not
know the distinction between a specimen and a sample ;
or, if he does, his personal interest prompts him to
magnify one into the other.

Zinc-extraction is now monopolising what atten-
tion Broken Hill can spare from the impending water-
famine. The threatened trouble over the patent rights
to the salt-cake or liquid treatment is coming to a head ;
C. V. Potter, of Melbourne, has issued a writ against the
B.H. Proprietary, claiming that the Delprat process
infringes his patent, and asking that the Delprat
machinery be converted into scrap metal and damages
paid. Meantime the B.H. Prop, continues its prepara-
tions to use the process on a much larger scale. The
Sulphide Corporation still sticks to the magnetic device ;
and, in conformity with its old policy of lying low
and doing nothing, B.H. Block 10 is simply watching
developments. Its position is this : it can make a small
profit with the magnetic plant which was experimented
with on the mine, but the indications seem to be that the
liquid process will make even more profit. On the whole,
this waiting policy has paid Block 10 very well; it thus,
for one thing, avoided the gijeat blunder which the South,
Central, British, and Junction made of providing expen-
sive smelting furnaces to treat their own ores. What
would happen if they all adopted a “waiting policy” is
another matter. Apropos magnetic concentration, David
Edwards, engineer first of the South and then of the
North, and one of the first men to patent a process for
the magnetic separation of Broken Hill ores, has left the
Barrier after 10 or 12 years’ service, to become engineer
of the newly amalgamated Parramatta and Yelta copper-
mines, S.A.

As this issue was going to press desperate
Broken Hill was offering £2OOO to the Yankee rain-maker,
Dr. M’Carthy, who has been making a noise in Vic.
lately, to go up and produce 3in of wet in three weeks,
and M’Carthy was asking for £5OOO. It’s pretty easy, at
a nice comfortable distance, to smile at Broken Hill’s
“ gullibility” ; but, somehow, things look different when
you’re in a desert, two or three hundred miles from
everywhere, and your water-supply looks like a small
quantity of green slime at the bottom of a small hole, and
the failure of even that supply means blank ruin. As
for the “rain-maker,” he’s all right. He wants to bet
nothing (or at most the price of a railway ticket) to £5OOO
that it will rain at Broken Hill within three weeks, in
what, even at Broken Hill, is the wettest month of the
year on the average ; and even this writer, who can’t
make rain worth a cent, would not mind writing 100
wagers of the same kind. But the rain-maker says that,
unless the £5OOO is made available, there will be no rain.
Therefore, by his own showing, he ranks with a Victorian
striking engine-driver—only 1000 times worse. The man
who knows how to drive an engine, but won’t do it, ex-
cept on certain terms, isn’t a patch in the way of iniquity
on the man who knows how to bring down rain and
won’t. What M’Carthy evidently needs is a strong Bent
Government to put him in gaol for 12 months and fine
him £lOO if it doesn’t rain. M’Carthy is on strike, and
what is the Bent-Irvine for but to put down strikes ?

Great Fingall South (W.A.), an offshoot of
Chaffers, which holds a preponderating interest, looks
like proving a good thing. Co. originally held some
blocks to the S.E. of the big mine, but diamond-drill
proved them worthless. Government then granted co.
right of mining on a reserve, and also paid £1 for
£1 subsidy to test the ground. At 700 ft., a
low-grade ore body was found, and, at 760 ft.,
a lode assaying soz. iBdwt. 16gr. Check assays of the
drill core have been made by Govt.; so that it is
practically responsible for the statement. Co. is in
750,000 shares of 4s. each, but the financial position is
obscure. Co. is managed by Fred. Cape, a well-known
Sydneyite.

Brown Hill Extended (W.A.) has gouged out
all the rich patch of ore in the N.W. corner of lease,
while the Associated Northern will have done ditto in
anothercoitple of months. As the two mines between them
have been responsible for from 17,000 to 18,000 oz. monthly,
there is likely to be a serious decline in W.A. returns till
the blank is filled by other mines, especially as South Kal-
gurli is also on the silent list. Shaft on Northern has
already passed the point (912 ft.) where pay ore was
“located by drill,” and it isn’t there. The next point
where good ore was reported was at 1100 ft., and it will
take .4 months to get there. The latter chute was
reported to be 8 to 10 ft. wide, and worth soz. The
depression in the scrip is not wonderful, and a consider-
able further drop would surprise none.

Queen Margaret (W. A.) had a very good crush-
ing from its South Gippsland lease —3940 z. from 250 tons.
The 10-head only ran half-time owing to water difficulties.
Manager Henderson says he has any amount of similar
ore in sight ; yet apparently insiders do not place much
faith in the future of the mine, or scrip would be much
higher. The reef averages 18in., and is being stoped
from the 185 and 285 ft levels. The shaft is going down
to 400 ft., when another level will be mrule availaole.
Stoping at the old Bulong property is still proceeding,
but the mine is practically worked out, and will shortly
be abandoned.

What gullible fools these Londoners be! At
the Golden Horseshoe meeting the chairman stated that
the policy of the directors was not to distribute any
larger annual dividends until they were satisfied that
they were “ properly entitled to do so.” This remark
was received with approving cheers. It was a pure
assumption of virtue, as the balance-sheet showed that
during the year the directors had distributed in divs.
every penny that they were properly entitled to do. It
may be fairly argued that they did more than this, inas-
much as they made no provision for a reserve fund. If
they are to write off 25 per cent, of the book-value of
plant and machinery every year there is necessity for
such a fund to provide for replacements.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W. A.) dropped £37,000 over
the sale of the Fremantle Smelting Works, and would,
on previous experience, have dropped a good deal more
if it hadn’t sold them. All smelting works are reputed
robbers; and yet the liquidator is always on their door-
step, or thereabout.

“Your husband tried to kiss me last night!
“Ah, well, you know he's drinking again."
On the subject of Father “Joe”
Bunbury’s tragic end, “R.C.” writes:
How was it that Father Bunbury, the “ silenced ”
priest, whose weakness in regard to grog was so well
known, was allowed to spend the three weeks which
preceded his death in a city pub ? If there was a Priests’
Home for such cases the result might have been different.
There was a Home ten years ago, and to-day there is
none. .Mainly as the result of a bequest of £lOOO by
Monsignor Lynch, who died in 1884 (a few months before
the arrival of Cardinal Moran), the Home for Aged and
Infirm Priests, known as,St, Charles Villa, was established
at Ryde. Cardinal Moran, in opening the Home in 1890,
said “it was a matter, of religious duty to provide an
honorable home for these priests, who would come there
to pass their declining years.” A few years later the
Cardinal turned the Home into a convent for nuns and an
orphanage. The broken-down priest has now no place of
refuge. Under the circumstances it should not surprise,
even, if it shocks, the Catholic community to hear that
two or three friendless old clerics have ended their days
miserably as paupers in the Government Asylums.
For superb, unmatchable cheek, the
pampered Vic. railway blackleg takes the bun.
A beautiful instance cropped up in Melb. Age
the other day, when “one of them,” after having
previously created a fuss by telling how he was
cold-shouldered by the other railway workers,
suggested that he and his class should receive
liberal compensation—a big sum in cash, in fact—
and should retire from “a position which no self-
respecting man would endure,” and resume loafing
at the corner. After the local “loyalist "’ insect
has put in a fortnight’s work he is naturally very
tired, and wants to go back to his old game of
letting the old woman earn a few shillings by
washing, so that he can spend his time trifling
with long beers in a pub. There is also another
kind of blackleg, the lily-white variety, and a
specimen of that kind likewise got his woeful
story into the Age. It seems that when this
aristocrat came nobly to the assistance of Thomas
Bent he was treated just as unceremoniously as if
he were a common—haw—everyday engine-man.
When the railway heads were unable to tell him
what time his train would go out next morning he
left instructions at the department that some—
haw—menial should telephone to his palace and
tell him the exact hour at which his services
would be required. And because they didn’t
telephone, or call round for him in a brougham,
but just relied upon him, as an ardent loyalist, to
get down to his work in the morning after the
manner of the ordinary worker, he became—haw—
quite angry, and threatened to pull some fellah’s
nose, or to use very strong language. Fortu-
nately, this fine young dude only had one day’s
experience on the footplate. A week of it would
have revealed the Railway Department to him as
such a sink ef democratic iniquity that he would—
haw—have preferred death.

Last Saturday night a Woolloomooloo
(Sydney) policeman found a 16-year-old boy lying
wounded in a lane off William-st. He had shot
himself in the left side with a pistol. Asked why
he did it, he said that his father had committed
suicide twelve months before, his mother had
since died in Sydney Hospital, and he was living
in lodgings. Death was to him a dim, shadowy
demesne where the rough edges of everything
were smoothed away, and where there Were no
lodgings.

In Victoria, if you are a man and there
are no other obstacles in the way, you can marry
your deceased wife’s sister ; but' the courts there
have just had thrown at them the problem
whether you can marry your deceased wife’s
sister’s daughter. The daughter of the sister-in-
law seems further off than the sister-in-law her-
self ; but in law she’s your niece, and there’s the
trouble. On the other hand, whether she’s your
niece or not, the tact remains that, in every other
relationship, if you can legally marry a woman to
whom you haven’t been married already, you can
legally marry her daughter, providing that lady
is old enough, and single, and doesn’t object.
It is a curious thing that when a man goes
mad through being employed by a contractor, at
14s. a week he generally begins by killing his wife
and children to put them out of their misery,
instead of killing the contractor to put him out
of his meanness.
NOT IN HER LINE.
Niece: “That is a portrait of Miss Slovely; don't you think she's
beautiful?"
AUNT: “No, indeed. She's not my style of beauty at all."
The case of that man who pleaded guilty
to a charge of having married a second wife while
the first one was still above the violets and the
daisies was characteristic. The defendant had
been separated from his first wife for a consider-
able time, and, hearing that she had married
again, reckoned that that action made him free
to do likewise. He seemed quite shocked at the
information that he had not been released by his
wife’s action. This strange ignorance of the law
is probably the basic reason for that frequent
advt. : “This is to notify my husband, John
Smith, that if he does not return within two
weeks it is my intention to marry again.—
(Signed) Jane Smith.”
A recent Fatman letter to S. M.
Herald extolled the absence of labor'
unions in Zion city, and,- in recom-
mending the system to this country,
spoke : “ Every honest employer will
give his employee what he can earn.”
. . . A few days after the Herald
reported : “ Shocking Tragedy in
Melbourne,” “Mother and Child
Murdered,” “Second Child Fatally
Injured,” “Killed by Hatchet Blows,’
“ The Father Missing,” and stated :
“Inability to pay the rent was proba-
bly the indirect cause of the tragedy
. . . he (the murderer, who has since
suicided) had acted as a driver for a
municipal contractor, receiving pay-
ment at the rate of 14s. per week.”
Truly, the penalty the community
pays for its sin in allowing a fourteen
shillings a week wage-rate is a grue-
some tragedy.
Thejit’st order issued by N.S.W. Assistant-
Inspector-General of Police :
Applications having been made by the police at a
number of places for the supply of letter-balances, it is
considered that the general issue of scales (which would
mean a large expenditure) can just now be very well
deferred. By the use of a little tact the police can always
manage to get their lettersweighed at the post office. ' "
The N.S.W. policemen already has to act as
electoral officer, health officer, burglar-chaser
dog-tax collector, compiler of jury lists, and a
hundred other things. In future he must add to
bis duties “ the use of a little tact ” to get official
letters weighed. And that may be the last straw

Troubles
Skilled counsel pleading for Jones and
Grand (condemned to death for the Auburn
murder) on an appeal put up a good fight for the
accused, but were handicapped by the fact that,
at the trial, when the accused had no skilled
counsel, the points liable to be taken in their favor
were passed over. Extract from S.M. Herald
report of the appeal:
Mr. Ralston said that there were two other points
which he wished to take, and one was that a large quan-
tity of evidence was given by the Crown as to previous
offences committed by Grand, and he submitted that the
Crown should not have been allowed to gave that evi-
dence. The fact that no objection was taken to it on
behalf of Grand made no difference. Somewhat similar
evidence was given in the case of Jones, but it was
objected to.
Mr. Pilcher took the objection that the point now
raised was not open to the accused ; and after further
argument,
The Court held that, as the special case was solely in
reference to his Honor’s direction or non-direction on a
point of law, the last point taken was not open to the
prisoners.
Perhaps the point, if taken, would have been sus-
tained ; perhaps not. In any case, the incident
shows the unfairness of the system of giving an
accused person, on trial for his life, a 2ld. defence
whilst he has to face a guinea prosecution.

The Owe’Sullivan is a curious character.
He has sent a gang of men to cut away the shrubs
growing near the Spit—one of the beauty spots of
Sydney suburbs—to make room for hoardings to
carry hideous patent-pill and soap advertisements.
And this is the gentleman who was such a whalg
for art that he wanted a colossal statue of “Aus-
tralia Facing the Dawn ” to be set up on Pinch-
gut ! But that was probably a passing frenzy.

STARTLED STRANGER: “Dear me! why?”

Some fiend disguised in the outer husk
and semblance of humanity has been sending back
to Maoriland photos, of the crowd of legislators
who went in the Mapouriki to view Seddon’s pro-
spective empire in Polynesia. The photos, mostly
represent them lounging about the decks in the
partially “ nood,” and Maoriland, which never
saw nearly so much of its law-makers before, is
surprised at their lack of dignity.
There is seldom a woman so fast but
remorse can overtake her.
Fleas and the police are never there.

Women inspectors under N.S.W.
Factory Act retail the difficulties they
meet with in their efforts to teach precau-
tion to the female employees.
A source of great danger is
the practice of the younger
ones of wearing their long
hair flying loose. Thelock3
might easily catch in the
machinery, but they are
deaf to argument. “Aren’t
you _ frightened ? ” queried
an inspector to a bright
young thing whose tresses
were aggressively flowing;
“Aren’t you frightened of
your hair getting en-
tangled?” “Oh yes, Miss.
Once Miss, it did catch,
and it was nearly all tore
out, Miss. I never will for-
get it, Miss—l won’t,
really! ”
As in future
the land of Nor-
folk Island is,
according to Gov-
ernor Kawson, to
be leased to the
settlers, instead of
being sold or granted,
the value of the land
already alienated will
be greatly increased,
and a land-tax is,
therefore, under con-
sideration. But a minia- _
ture insurrection is likely
to result. When a Gov.
ernment order broke up the
settlement in 1805 those owning
land raised a hefty row, and
were only appeased on being
given land grants double the size in Tasmania.
New Norfolk and Norfolk Plains (Tas.) are names
that recall that 98-years-old job.
• a Burglar Bill ’’ : When a magistrate or
judge gets the gout he should be promptly re-
trenched, and so, more especially, should a gaol
“beak.” The extra biting
edge which the bad leg or
toe puts on his sentences
seldom leaks out, and when
the unfortunate does get a
chance it is too late to resur-
rect things. I know a gaol
punishment book which has
the track of a gouty leg all
through its pages. By its
aid I could write a weather
record for the past seven
years. The “ beak ” will find
a lot of curses piled against
the back of the Golden Door
when he knocks, even if the
Lord makes allowance for the
gouty leg.

The ballot held at Gee-
long (Vic.) for 39 of Lands
Minister Taverner’s available
Beech Forest blocks drew 511
applications. It is estimated
that it will take three genera-
tions to clear the land, and
produce must be carted on
sledges to main centres. To
relieve the distress prevail-
ing in Ballarat (Vic.) this
winter a soup kitchen is to
be started by local clergy and
managed by Salvarmy offi-
cers. Yet Conservative poli-
ticians tell us we want more
population— to rush the par-
son for a soup ticket or
Taverner for a chance to
bury themselves in a living
grave.

A quaint item in smart
Society is “baby cards.” As
soon as the mother is in a fit
state to receive visitors, she
sends cards to all her friends
inscribed “Mrs. Duboschay
and baby, at home,” etc. A 3
regards the baby the infor-
ination seems wildly super-
fluous. No one would expect an infant of that
age to be at the public-house. The “baby’s
cards ” are extremely popular with the recently-
married folks, but those who have had eight
babies view the idea coldly.

It’s lucky for the reputation of the police
that accidents do happen. An ex-solicitor of
Sydney planned a most elaborate series of
forgeries in Melbourne. No detail was wanting.
He provided even for rubber stamps with the names
of the firms he had his eye on. Carefully he
divided his orders among the shops which said
they made rubber stamps. He didn’t know that
they didn’t really make the stamps—that they
simply farmed out the orders to another firm ;
and when that firm was struck by an unexplain-
able rush for rubber stamps it began to suspect
things, and called in a policeman. And the
policeman called in the ex-solicitor for six months
—and all because a firm or two said it made
rubber stamps when it really only collected a
commission from other people for making them.

A letter from a Melbourne “ white-work ”
manufacturer sets forth that, since the Federal
tariff reduced the duty on women’s blouses by
nearly 50 per cent, he has not made a single
blouse, half his machines are idle, and many of
his former employees are out of work. The
published report of an English factory inspector
shows that blouses are made in London by “ out-
side workers ”at each ; and either the Aus-
tralian woman must work for the same unspeak-
able wage, or she must be unemployed, or there
must be a sufficient duty to cover the difference
between 2Jd. and a living wage. The M'Millan and
Pumpkin Smith and Bruce Smith party is quite
proud of the partial success of its efforts to drag
the Australian woman down to the ghastly
horrors of blouse-making at 2^d.

Bent seems to be running his Victorian
comic railways on much the same principle (or
lack of it) as the very small infant who builds a
mud house and then deliberately aims rocks at it.
Thomas the Blunderer lately offered free passes to
persons building houses along some of his disused
suburban lines, but since the strike most of these
dilapidated remnants of lines have had such a
wretched service that even the existing residents
are departing as hastily as they can pack up their
goods and chattels. On the Glen Iris and Outer
Circle lines (both within Bent’s ‘‘free pass”
radius) there is now absolutely no train either way
after 6 p.in. Bent, however, equalises matters by
giving Eltham—a lone bush paddock with houses
as frequent as crocodiles in Greece—an extra train
a day and two more on Sunday. Eltham is in the
electorate and adjacent to the home of brother
Minister Ewan Cameron.

The quick succumbing of so many of the
Oakland crew, when exposed in an open boat for
a few hours in autumn weather, suggests either
that the men were of very poor stamina or that
they were very much exhausted before taking to
the boats. A healthy, well-fed, reasonably-clad
man can stand, as a rule, 24 hours’ exposure in
the bitterly cold weather of the far Southern seas.

Governor Ranfurly laid the foundation-
stone of his own pet dog-kennel, the Veterans’
Home, at Auckland on Empire Day—the most
piebald holiday in M.L. He explained, in a weary
sort of way, that £BOOO had been collected, and
that another £4OOO was required to finish the job,
and he hoped it would be subscribed. But it
won’t. Maorilanders have a plentiful lack of
enthusiasm on the subject which has filled Ran-
furly with disgust.
Justice Pring recorded sentence of death
on Arthur Straehan,- found guilty of attempting
to murder a girl in Sydney. The recording of a
sentence of death is merely an official act, free
from theatricality of every kind, and giving no
scope for the maudlin pathos and bad taste some
Judges indulge in when orally pronouhcing such
a sentence. The jury recommended Straehan to
mercy, and it is almost certain the recoihmenda-
tion will be adopted, although attempt at murder
is a capital offence as the law stands. It is gener-
ally understood, in fact, that when the Judge
give up his cherished privilege of making a
droning sound in the practically dead man’s ear
for a great length of time the sentence will not be
carried out. The case suggests the advisable-
ness of recording death sentences on all oc-
casions. What good does it do the Judge-
or the prisoner to go through the half-
hour or quarter hour of weeping conversation, in
the course of which his Honor talks buzzing
t° the prisoner about his past evil life,
and the prisoner sometimes, but much too rarely,
breaks in to inform his Honor that he is a dull,
pompous, lamentable old ass, and that he makes
a noise like an immense angry bee stuck in a
plate of treacle? The only man who can afford
to tell these truths to his Honoris the man who
is sentenced to death under circumstances that
give no hope of reprieve, and if he would only
rise to the occasion oftener, and ask his Honor
not to be a pious and long-winded gramaphone,
he might do some good before he departs.

Judge Prynnge has decided that soldiers
oan t sue for their pay. “If soldiers were allowed
to sue for their pay, or for any other grievances
they might fancy they had, it would lead
unquestionably to great insubordination.” Cer-
tainly. If a soldier is swindled, he must obey.
If he is jumped on, he must still obey. If he
can t get justice, he must go on obeying. A
soldier, in fact, isn’t supposed to know when he is
swindled, and he isn’t supposed to know what
justice is. He is just supposed to take what is
given him, and salute; and kill whomsoever he is
told to kill, and salute again. It’s a very fine
occupation for a civilised democracy to encourage.

One evening, about three days after the
beginning of the Victorian railway strike, a wild
and beery individual, very much out at elbow, was
leaning over the parapet of Princes’ Bridge, head
on hands, while through his clenched teeth he
muttered, bitterly, “Re-jictid—Re-jictid.” A
kind-hearted, elderly man, with a fat, good-
humored face and stomach to match, stopped,
went up to him, put a hand on his shoulder, and
cheerfully urged, “Buck up, old man ! buck up !
Lots more girls in the world. She’s not the only
pebble on- .” “What in ’ellish yer talkin’
abart?” rudely interrupted the beery one, with a
wild gleam artd a loud hiccup. “ Whosh talkin’of
galsh ! You and your short think o’ nothin’ but
wimminish ! (hie.) ” (Here the friendly citizen
went pink.) “ Wimmin be ! Fact ish (hie),
I plied to that Bent for ter drive enginish,
and he slung me out. Me !! ” And he turned
his back on the crowd that had collected,
and wept audibly. Later on, he was being
helped into a cab by two constables, all the time
explaining that Bent was his uncle, and that Tom
Mann would, in six months, be Premier of
Victoria.

The Melbourne Queen's Memorial Statue
fund being too small to allow the design chosen
to. be executed completely in marble, the com-
mittee lately decided to have a freestone pedestal.
Freestone being almost as evanescent as the
memory of the lady herself, local architects now
suggest a brickwork monument with a veneer of
marble. Gouldn t something be done in the way
of a pedestal and ‘ statoo ’ of lead or pig-iron (lead
is cheap just now) to be gilded over or painted in
colors? This would allow of half the fund beino-
invested at interest (with a committee to admin-
ister it), said interest being applied to repainting
the statue as often as required. Besides being
a permanent and reproductive work, this would
also serve to keep the lady’s memory green—or
some other color according to the committee’s
taste.
The of it ! Daring the recent Vic-
torian loco, men’s strike the greater part of the
trains that were run were either driven by the
loco, foremen, or the locomotives were run by
blacklegs with a foreman on the engine to look
after things. The loco, foremen are almost all
ex-drivers. They got their positions because the
Engine-drivers’, and Firemen’s Association, by
much hard fighting, got it recognised that their
senior men should, get those billets, which had
formerly gone to senior engine-fitters. Thus the
Association assisted its own defeat by placing
men in power who could take the drivers’ places
on an emergency.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, June 9,1903.
My Dear Arini,—
The descent of the Japanese squadron upon the
port of Sydney illustrated another sham of our
civilisation—that of the “official call.” First
couple of days were mainly occupied by the
Governor-General, the State Governor, the
British Admiral, and other personages “calling
on’’ the visiting Admiral. First some big guns
would explode violently, and a launch would
deposit the visiting potentate on the Jap’s deck.
The Japs couldn’t understand the visitor nor the
visitor the Japs, and in a few moments there
would be more loud explosions, and the visitor
would bolt shoreward for home, arriving there
just in .time to hear further loud explosions,
announcing that the Jap Admiral had just
started to call on him in the same unintelligible
fashion.
The three black-hulled, red-water-lined Jap
warships, with their curious Marconigram masts,
made stately entry to our harbor on Friday.
Since then our streets and shops and trams have
been overrun with civil, smiling, snub-nosed,
brown, blue-dressed sailors. I have heard that
most of the officers keep diaries. Oh, for a read
of some of the entries made after, for instance,
Mrs. Fanshawe’s reception at Admiralty House
on Saturday. They and the Australians at the
function were naturally handicapped by not being
able to converse. They have very little English.
One gave me to understand that he liked
“ Ho-bat,” and that Mt. Wellington was
like Fujiyama. I tried my book knowledge
of Japan on him, but he replied only with polite
wriggles. They yearned to watch the girls,
especially the blonde ones. Miss Fanshawe
floated about, introducing brown men and white
girls, and all the inscrutable black eyes followed
her white and gold and pink presence, wondering
why the chrysanthemum that cherry-blossom girl
had so much liberty and what the Daimio she
was saying. When an Australian damsel meets a
foreigner she thinks it the proper courteous
international thing to make inquiries re the
customs of his country. So: “Is it true,” asked
Miss Point Piper of a junior Jap, “that little
girls of two years in your country have dolls
strapped to their backs to accustom them to the
carrying of babies later on ? ” “ Welly tine yar-
ber, Sydney.—Yes! ” replied the gentleman.
Yet Miss P.P. had the face to tell her friends after
the reception that he and she had had a most
interesting chat.
Mrs. Fanshawe’s “ at home ” was more Asiatic
than Caucasian. It would have added to the
gaiety of this nation and of the brown men if the
women guests had worn kimonos, obis, and clogs,
and blackleaded hair with skewers in it. No need
to carry the idea so far as blackening the teeth
and shaving the eyebrows. The hostess, a pre-
maturely grey lady, wore a Morris green velvet
gown with white lace. If she had stood against a
dark-red curtain and purply-grey pillar with one
foot on a warm-brown footstool (provided the foot
wasn’t too English), with a panel of Sydney Har-
bor and a misty suggestion of hubby’s flagship
down the perspective, she yould have fixed up a
really fine picture.
A side show which took the Japs’ fancy at
Admiralty House reception was that of an unob-
trusive little lady taking notes for one of the
dailies. A crescent-shaped phalanx of the choco-
late men watched alternately her pencil and her
face with intense interest. They probably thought
that she was sketching them, for they assumed
their best attitudes and patted their medals
anxiously.
Mrs. Everard Brown, her golden hair twisted
cable-wise, wore the only (diamond) tiara in the
room; most of the rest of her wore shimmery,
clinging black. That tiara puzzled the Japs;
they wondered how any of us dared to walk other-
wise than backwards from it. Mrs. Philip
Morton, who certainly does not go to The
Scream, The Gentle Hint or Home Fits, to
learn how to dress, had a huge blossom, like a
single petal sun-flower above her forehead, and
around her decollete gown fell a deep ermine
collar. Mdme. Eitaki, the Jap Consul’s wife,
really ought to wear her own national dress ; I’m
sure the low European gown makes her unhappy ;
but she s a dear little, smiling, self-possessed
woman, who couldn’t make an enemy—except,
perhaps, of her dressmaker.
What a good thing for Brigadier-General Finn
that he was not in charge of the review on Satur-
day. As it was a State function he should have
been in charge, but the fact that he was not, saved
him from hibiscus-hued language from andsome
’Utton after the blunder in the march past
occurred. If the “ brilliant pageant ” had been
Finned instead of Huttoned the fiasco might not
have happened.
A citizen, whom the law recently relieved
of his matrimonial bonds on his own petition,
is explaining privately to scores of friends
that his Gwendoline did not care a straw
personally for the intruding Guy ; it was his
flattery that led her astray. With deep sighs
Guy would pour into her ears his regret that she
had not married a Governor, and that she ought
to be at least head of the society of a State, if not
of that of all six States. It was a crime on the
part of plain Alphonso, her husband, to have
married her, and thus robbed some one of high
degree of the chance. Guy, who lived in cham-
bers, was fond of music, but could not play ; so
Gwendoline made him a present of the school-
room piano, which was a good one, and bought
him a pianola, and sent the bill (£6O) to her plain
Alphonso—who paid it, thinking the machine
had been ordered for, and was then in,
the schoolroom. And Guy would find fault
with the way Gwen did her hair, saying that the
style did not do justice to her “ cameo profile ”
and that it detracted from the “singular inner
beauty displayed in her eyes.” What he meant
by this sentence probably not even Guy knew,
but it impressed Gwen immensely, and she gave
him a pair of sleeve links for it, and got very weary
of the man who thought the acme of hair dressing
was “ neatness,” and of the commonplace people
around who persisted in thinking her just one of
themselves. But plain Alphonso woke up one
day, and began to see solicitors, and at the first
hint of the trouble Guy fled the country without
even a farewell line to Gwendoline.
What guys some of the Sydney women make of
their heads by sticking so many combs, hairpins,
and other ornaments of tortoise-shell, celluloid or
metal into their hair. At a recent ball, I saw one
head of hair pierced by seven celluloid arrows. If
a spark had fallen on that arrowed region, what a
horror would have ensued. Recently, in Paris, a
lady and gentleman were driving in a cab to a
cemetery, carrying a celluloid wreath with them,
when a spark from the man’s cigarette fell on the
masquerading guncotton. It burst into flame, set
fire to their clothing and the cab. Of course,
persons guilty of trying to honor the dead with
such a horror as a celluloid wreath deserve some
punishment, but nothing so severe as burning.
“M.A.P.” (Molasses All Persons) has a par., in
a recent issue, about the late W. B. Dailey which
shows how little the writer knows about the sub-
ject on which he spreads himself. “ The hand of
Death sought him early,” says the ’grapher;
and “the fine son who was to carry forward the
torch of his genius and gentleness soon followed
him away. The lad came over to England to
school a few years ago, fell off his pony, and was
killed.” Now Dailey had three sons. It
was the youngest, Charles, who was killed,
and _ not off a pony either, but in the
hunting field. There was nothing he was not
game to ride. The “lad” was old enough
to be engaged (to Miss Fattorini, who after-
wards married Captain Fitzwilliam Curtis).
There are two other sons, W. 8., named after his
father, lives in England, and is by way of being a
barrister. He is a sportsman, and contributes to
the Badminton Magazine, and his verses (signed
with a pen-name) appear occasionally. The second
son, Jack, who lives in Sydney, is also a barrister,
a squire of dames, and a gourmet, who promises
to re-establish the famous fish dinners that his
father inaugurated. He is a good horseman,
fancies himself as a whip, and does not look out
of place driving a drag-load of pretty women to a
racecourse.
And how absurd does high-falutin’ praise seem
from the mouth or pen of the man who betrays a
deep ignorance of the subject of his eulogy. “I
knew him when he was a bhoy, and watched his
jaynious divilop from the crradle,” said one of
these extravagant eulogists the other day, in my
hearing, of a man older than himself. Another
instance: A politician of great “eloquence”
and a 10-donkey praise-power, wasintroducing two
men the other day. He slimed one of them over
with fantastic compliments, and announced his
name; to the other he applied even more extra-
vagant adjectives of eulogy, stated how he had
looked with pride on the development of his
mighty intellect, then leaned forward and whis-
pered, “My dear sir, what is your name ? I have
forgotten it.”
A pretty actress visiting Australia, who poses
as something of a playwright and short-storyist,
when talking “littery-like” to an acquaintance
recently, referred to “Lord” Swinburne. “Swin-
burne is not titled,” said the other, but the actress
would have him a lord.
Junior Mrs. Henniker Heaton, who was in
Sydney lately, and is related to Swinburne, used
to tell of two prim, rich sisters, who once called
upon her, and to whom she exhibited a Cosway
miniature of Lady Something (Ashburnham was,
I think, the name), Swinburne’s mother. “ Was
Swinburne’s mother a lady of title ? ” asked one
of the sisters amazedly. On being assured, she
turned to her sister, exclaiming: “Oh, Ethelind,
and we have always refused to have his poems in
the house—we must get them at once.”
Now is the season of the Income Tax payment.
I see that Miss Margaret Harris has been appeal-
ing against her assessments. Miss Margaret is a
sister of Matthew Harris, and possesses the finest
suite of emeralds, rubies and opals in New South
Wales, or perhaps out of it.
A ball in aid of the Orphanage of Mercy will
be held in Paddington Town Hall next Monday,
15th inst. The very name commends it to our
sympathies. All good persons will buy a ticket,
as a matter of course, and all very bad ones
should do so without delay, in order that they
may obtain mercy—hereafter. Hon. secs. : Mrs.
Chas. Hothain, of Ocean-street, and Miss Gollin.
Two old-time families joined in matrimony last
month, when Sydney Laurance Myles, grandson
of Laurance Myles (who, in the ’4o’s, was Com-
missioner of Police in Sydney, and who built the
huge pile which shows on the skyline above
Dawes Point, and is still known as Myles’ Build-
ings), married Ethel Muriel Daly, a grand-
daughter of one of Sydney’s best-known commer-
cial men of half-a-century ago, Christopher
Newton. There is a highly honorable episode
attached to the latter gentleman’s career. He
failed in business, but kept pegging away until
20s. in the £ was paid. The English creditors
fitted out a steam yacht, of big burden, at a cost
of some thousands, and presented the vessel com-
plete, and ready for sea, to Mr. Newton. That
-was in the ’7o’s.
Artist Longstaff has had three pictures accepted
by the Royal Academy show. One, a portrait of
Mrs. Scantlebury, hangs on the line.
Sydney streets during our wet spell—what
fearsome sights they were ! In the State Premier’s
journey across the Blacksoil Plains he had at
least clean mud to negotiate. Our mud was dirty
and semi-liquid. Pitt-street, from Post Office to
MarkeC-street—the most central part of the city—
was unspeakably dirty ; and one had to board the
tram cars through pools of water and quagmires
of slush. Judging from signs, by-laws against
expectorating on the sidewalks must oe useless,
and it is time that the Sydney Ferries Co. made
punishable the offence of expectorating on the
decks of their steamers. There is merely a
printed notice: “Passengers are requested not
to spit ” ; but it is of no more importance to a
certain class of travellers than what the wild
waves are saying. In New York there is a fine
of 500 dollars or a year’s imprisonment for spit-
ting in a tram car. In Paris a by-law has just
been framed, which makes it punishable to put
the smallest bit of rag or paper or fruit paring in
the streets—all proper precautions against the
spread of the tubercle bacillus.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
< * ‘ The other Sunday was late Queen Victoria’s
birthday. How many people remembered to
drop a tear in memory of the Widow of Windsor ?
Poor old Queen, the role of widow was the last
one Nature had meant her for. I have been
reading a contemporary account of her appear-
ance at a dinner in the Inner Temple in 1844,
when she was a plump, jovial little matron of 25,
with her Albert at her side and a fast-filling
nursery of bouncing babies. She went to the law-
dinner in a bonnet of blue drawn-silk with white
feather, dress of Limerick lace and scarlet Indian
shawl with deep gold border. She ate heartily
of the ‘ cold collation, ’ smiled and talked happily,
and when they drank ‘ dear Albert’s ’ health, she
stood up and drained her glass of port wine to the
dregs. When she was leaving, a broken wine-
glass lay in her path. A gallant barrister flung
a serviette over it and knelt right on top of it for
fear it might graze the Royal shoe. Queen
Elizabeth knighted Raleigh for less, but then
Elizabeth had not an Albert to monopolise her
favors.
“Justice Williams’ library, recently sold,
proved disappointing to book-lovers. Seemingly,
the student, in the end, had not been able to part
with his pet volumes, those submitted for sale being
only a scratch lot, just as weak in law literature
as in general reading. The retired judge is the
father of a large family, and the auctioneer had to
deal with nine sets of school-books and lots of
out-of-date nursery volumes, such as “Watching
for Pa,” “ Infants’ Magazine ” etc., which, for all
the price they brought, might just as well have
been given to some juvenile charitable library.
His Honor evidently looks forward to a quiet time
in England, as before his departure he tried to
dispose of his court suit and similar sartorial
gew-gaws among his judicial brethren. The latter,
however, did not rush the second-hand plumage,
most of them having reached the stage when
figure idiosyncrasies demand individual tailoring.
“St. Vincent’s Hospital hop gave the season its
start in a quite brilliant style. What with
official, military, hunting and hop-scotch sets, to
say nothing of a host of cabbage-green and
Dresden squares, the sight in the Town Hall was
worth seeing. The powder from hundreds of
flaked thatches thickened the air, left a layer on
flying swallow-tails, and an unnecessary coat-
ing on carefully-adjusted complexions. It was
the one grief of the evening. Some of the frisky
‘ setters ’ dangled a Romney ringlet, and then
there was enough flour left on the chest to fur-
nish a tray of biscuits. The Waxellency lancered
gleefully in and out of the official margin, evi-
dently in his theatrical element. Mayor Gillott
waxed genial. The uses of office have won for
the practical lawyer some of the grease paints of
social flattery,
“Two Toorak sisters wore, surmounting their
towering hair-frames, immense hoops of pink
roses reared aloft on blue foundations. Miss
Frankie Oliver was one of the buxom beauties,
young enough and pretty enough to stand the
frosted and spotted layings-on to advantage.
The elaborate make-up of most others spelt
disaster, and one saw with a sigh, here and there,
a coy curl drooping on a withered breast.
“The manoeuvres of the young man with a
detachment of sisters at a fashionable hop are a
fine subject for study. Always the same sad fear
in the eyes of the bravely-smiling sisters, always
the same assumption of good comradeship about
the brother. He goes scouting, slaps a chum on
the back, talks and laughs strainedly awhile, then
gets it off his chest—* Gome and see the girls.’
‘Here?’ ‘ Yes, the three are here. You'd better
come while there’s a chance of nailing them for a
whirl.’ While there’s a chance ! The mockery of
it! The Johnnie *on his own ’ has to be a strate-
gist to evade chums with sisters of the pale, sad
type.
“ Melbourne gets itself ready for a masquerade
ball—the first for many a season. The Dowager
of Cliveden is the head of the mask committee,
and helps to devise means for keeping the whirl
select. There is such latitude in a dress of dis-
guise that the ‘ very swift, may be expected to
rush into dominoes and crowd the hall. The
■committee women are seized with this fear, and
are in the throes of a dozen good schemes for
keeping the alloy from their gold. They keenly
■desire to have some kind of espionage without
■offending the desirable. Some of the most
matured matrons are in the thick of the arrange-
ments. A chance for these frisky old ladies to
cover the Time tracks and the fading features
with a jaunty and misleading domino is too great
a temptation to be resisted.
“All the Millers, and the Toorak clans gener-
rallied to the Hunt Club meeting on
Saturday. The gee-gee crowd, inured to the
damp and rheumatic conditions of Moonee
Valley in the wet season, piled on coats, cloaks,
and furs. The Cliveden dowager despised
all cumbersome trappings, and stood out bv
reason of her \ onderfully moulded form and
subdued black and white raiment. Muffled up
like a sleigh driver, as a type of the other
extreme, was big John Forrest’s wife.
“The L. C. Mackinnons made the great driving
splash of the Hunt meeting, with a spanking four-
in-hand. Several Melbourne bachelors figured on
its passenger list. It was a novelty to see the
spry, short-skirted girls skip to their box seats.
Two or three clean strides and they were there.
No entrapped chiffons; no train reefings. The
women mostly turned out in the brief skirt and
the new military coat, into the pockets of which
they thrust their hands. Miss Eva Robertson, in
the widest and briefest of skirts, sported a mass of
hunting-red trimmings with rather brilliant effect.
All the racy men wore gold bugles in their cravats!
“ Theatrical matinees provide excellent oppor-
tunities for conning sensational millinery. At
Carrie Moore’s farewell, wonderful hats of palest-
blue felt, trailed with convolvuli, white, faint-blue,
and black, respectively, were worn by a pair of
smart sisters, who have returned from Europe,
prone to startle, not to say shock, stay at-home
friends by dress, complexion and deportment
novelties, described by the tourists themselves,
as ‘the latest from Paris.’ People who know the
French capital will ask, ‘Which Paris?’ The
city of the boulevardes is many-sided, and boasts
as much variety of output as did Noah’s Ark in
its day. At the same matinee, Miss Eva Robert-
son topped a chic gown of black erepe-de-chine
with a choice millinery blend of white felt, sable
fur and French fringe.
“ In recognition of the fact that the late Dr.
Morrison was regarded as the father of Melbourne
secondary schools, some 800 schoolboys marched
in front of his coffin, while ‘ old boys, ’’Varsity
senators, and many more representatives of public
bodies took part in the procession. To the last
hour of his life the old doctor was handsome,
erect of bearing, and breezy and debonair of man-
ner. He had been a most successful man from all
points of view. His financial and domestic
affairs were as prosperous as his academic arrange-
ments. Many years ago he sustained a great loss
in the death of his wife, but his old age was
cheered by the devotion of seven children, upon
whom he had lavished every advantage that
education and foreign travel could supply. The
old doctor himself described his eldest son, Mr.
Alec. Morrison, barrister, musical critic and
traveller, as ‘one of the most brilliant young men
in Melbourne,’ but not built to make money at
the Bar, like Dr. Morrison’s son-in-law, Mr. E. F.
Mitchell. The Scotch College patriarch lived to
see all three of his dark, elegant daughters happily
married, and literally revelled in the role of grand-
father. Just the other Wednesday afternoon he
looked the happiest person in the Princess d.e., at
the beck and call of a bevy of gipsy-eyed grand-
daughters, seeing ‘ Midsummer Night’s Dream ’
under Gaffer’s fond auspices. The same little
ones had been his companions on his afternoon
walk the day of his death, which came, seemingly
without a pang, as he sat in his favorite study-
chair, chatting to his daughter and a friend.
“Miss Dora Rignold’s Celia, especially in the
first act, recalls the figure of one of the stained-
glass Saints coquetting with the sunlight in a
local Cathedral. Miss Kerin’s Rosalind smiles
with distressing frequency, and the stiff, stately
Celia with painful effort. One of the most natural
and pleasant features of their acting together is the
spontaneous embrace that follows every avowal or
tearful call to arms. The pair play up to each
other affectionately—a rare thing in the sex when
hugging is in frequent question. But they are
inseparable off the boards. To see them buying;
sweets together, and playfully sorting out their
chocolate fancies, i 3 to forget ail instances of mere
male friendship.
“ The departure of the comic-opera trippers
from Melbourne boards brought prodigious sighs
from ti e stalls where the golden asses bray.
Tangible sympathy was shown by a Dives inHhe
squatting line, who, with magnificent unconcern,
scattered numerous small cheques among the
coyest of the co. with the remark that
he hadn’t time to buy a souvenir—didn’t
know how or what—ribbons not in his
line, etc., etc., and he was leaving the
nuisance of purchase in their hands. A diamond
bauble for one particular Trilby was a souvenir
that caused considerable trouble. The air quivered
with jaundiced comments. One well-favored
trophy-bearer hummed, ‘ Everybody’s awfully
good to me,’ till her associates nearly choked witn
rage.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


INFLUENZA.
Influenza is in the air! You cannot escape it unless you set your blood right with Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. They actually make new blood.
If Influenza germs get into your system when your blood is poor, you will fall an easy victim to
fevers and chills, headaches and backaches, and all the other weakening tortures of La Grippe.
And Influenza always leaves you a weary, wretched wreck—a prey to Pneumonia, Bronchitis,
Consumption, Rheumatic Fever, and deadly Kidney trouble.
But, taken in time, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ward off Influenza by bracing the blood to fight the
o-erms. Taken after an attack, they drive out the poisonous dregs of disease and build up the shattered
strength.
Terribly Weak Through Influenza. —“lnfluenza pulled me down terribly,” say* Mr. J. J. Talbot,
6 Smith’s Terrace, Edward-street, Wagga Wagga. “ I was far too weak and ill to attend to business. I turned from
food, and did not care whether I lived or died. My legs and back lost all strength so that I could hardly walk. 1w w
a burden to myself and everyone else. Then a Wagga resident recommended Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. The first three
doses did me a little good—and from that time on I improved. Within a fortnight I was almost well, and before long
I was completely cured. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have swept every trace of influenza from my s,\ stem.”

Thomas Bent, Vic.’s railway nigger driver
was born at Penrith (N.S.W.) in 1837.
Henry Lawson’s wife obtained a decree
for judicial separation against him last week.
Governor Le Hunte, late of New Guinea,
and now of S.A., is a native of County Wexford,
Ireland.
Mrs. Outtrim, mother of ex-M.L.A. Out-
trim (Vic.), has just celebrated her 93rd birthday
at Maryborough, and is still hale and hearty.
Rumor has it up North that Premier
Philp is going back to his old firm of Burns, Philp
and Co., as manager, with a big salary. Proba-
bly rumor lies as usual.
Cabled that Bob Cab Smith, Archbishop
of Sydney, fell on a hard, rocky road somewhere
at ’Ome and hurt his kneecap. That is what
comes of not taking a cab.
An ex-M.P. of S.A., and one of the
brainiest of them, was lately “sent up” as an
incorrigible rogue and vagabond. A pitiable
dipsomaniac—nothing worse. What an ass the
law is that has no place for such men but a gaol 1
Maitland (N.S.W.) claims to be the birth-
place of a full-blown British army general.
General Baker Creed Russell, who has just
attained the rank, was born on the Hunter in
1837—a son of Bowen Russell, M.L.C., and brother
of the N.S.W. rain predictor.
The whirligig of time l A one-time red-
hot Australian labor agitator of the fire-brand
type, and now an employer, sacked an employee,
the other day, for omitting to address him as
“Sir ! ” Had a squatter made the same request
to that same boss 10 years ago, there would prob-
ably have been an inquest on that station.
Living in retirement in a picturesque spot
overlooking Willoughby Falls, Middle Harbor
(Sydney), is an old Queensland parliamentarian,
Mr. J. Malbon Thomp-
son. He is a native
of Sydney, born in
1830, and son of
John Thompson,
Deputy - Surveyor
of the State. Mr.
Thompson was ad-
mitted a solicitor
in Sydney in 1855.
He removed to
Ipswich (Q.), and
was elected for
the town in 1868:
was Chairman of
Committees for
two years, Lands
Minister under
Palmer, 1870 - 73,
and Minister for
Works until ’74, when
Palmer’s Government
retired. He was
Minister for Justice
under MTlwraith in
L 879. While Min-
ister for Lands he
carried the Home-
steads Area Bill,
and did a good deal
towards the stoppage of
dummying.
The rumored intention
of N.S.W. Minister Crick
to quit the solicitor branch
of the profession and go to
the Bar so as to qualify for
the Attorney-Generalship
reproduces part of an old
legal-parliamentary situa-
tion of nearly half a century
ago. James Martin, after-
wards Chief-Justice, joined the
Cowper Ministry as Attorney-General
in 1856. He was then a solicitor,
and although the office was legally
held, W. M. Manning, Edward Wise
and other haughty barristers kicked
against being officially
subject to a solicitor.
The opposition was so
strong that the Govern-
ment lasted only 37
days. Martin promptly
turned over to the Bar
and re-emerged as
Attorney-General
the following year.
N.S.W. may yet
be startled to see
SENATAH MATHIESON.
of W.A.
Jack Want acting officially as Crick’s junior.
Of interest to Australian politicians who
struggle for, and proudly sport, the degrading
badge of G.C.M.G., K.C.M.G., &c., to note that
during King Ned’s recent tour of Scotland the
mayors of the principal cities had nothing less
than a baronetcy offered to them.
“If God gives me my heart’s wish,” said
Kingston the other day, replying to somebody
who asked him if he was going on to the High
Court bench, “I will die in legislative harness,
doing my best for the people, fighting for them
on the platform and in Parliament.”
Sydney Morning Herald manager, Sam
Cook, called on N.S.W. Minister Perry, the other
day, to complain bitterly of misrepresentation of
the newspapers by the Ministry. “Ah,” said
Perry, “now you knowhow we feel sometimes.”
And that’s all the satisfaction Cook got.
Ex-detective Broomfield (N.S.W.), who
died recently, at 86 years of age, was one of the
Sydney d.’s told off to follow the Duke of Edin-
burgh on his second visit to Australia. He com-
plained that he was not paid his expenses for the
service, but. then the Duke’s washerwoman was
also unpaid.
It is gossiped in Adelaide that Customs
Minister Kingston has devoted nearly the whole
of his official salary to the liquidation of his pri-
vate debts, the bulk of which consisted of liabili-
ties bequeathed by his brother, who died some
years ago. Those who are acquainted with King-
ston know that he lives in the simplest manner,
spending practically nothing on himself. Had he
stuck to the law he could have easily. earned £5OOO
a year instead of the paltry wages paid by Govern-
ments.
“Politicus” : Recent Bulletin par. con-
cerning “Pom-Pom” Forrest and the origin of
his nickname is slightly in error. The name
“ Pom-Pom ” was bestowed on Forrest by W. Lr
Higgs (at that time M.L. A. for Fortitude Valley)
on account of that gentleman’s pom-pompous,
short, barking style of utterance. I orres spo i-
tical mana was tolerably high in Queensland
politics a few years ago, but at present
looked upon as a hopelessly out-of-date back-
number.
One of the representatives of Dowie’sZion
City in Adelaide, Rev. C. Friend Hawkins, is
said to have dabbled in almost every religion bar
oalvarmyism and Buddhism. After all, religions
are so much alike that there seems no real reason
why a man shouldn’t belong to all of them at once
instead of trying them one after the other.
There was only one clause of Wise’s letter
re I reetrade for Freetrade newspapers which
Sydney D.T. published without comment, and
that simply embodied a tag of Latin (from Seneca)
explaining why he wasn’t going to bandy person-
alities with the paper. It was ignored, probably
because the D.T. didn’t understand that part.
David Syme did not pay the expenses of
his leader of the staff (Fox) in the recent action
against I’renwith, although everyone seemed to
that the Age was bearing the cost of the
libel case. A subscription to help in meeting the
legal charges (£560) is now being raised, and pre-
sumably David will shell out liberally, more par-
ticularly as he has just published a book on
Soul.”
Dr. Alexander Morrison, principal of
Scotts’ College, Melbourne, who died the other
Sunday, was one of the old veterans of Victorian
wo’ hberal world did not agree with
Sandy ” very well, but that concerned him not.
He went his own way, stiff-backed and bigoted,
but honest and sincere. He was of the old Pres-
byterian school, with an unshakable belief in
hell and such-like institutions. He was one of
the heresy-hunters in Charles Strong’s time ; and
no one could smell heresy at longer range than
the old doctor.
Barton denied, during the Melbourne rail-
way strike, that he had any idea of calling out the
Federal military. Nevertheless he was in a great
funk, and thought that there would be civil war.
Railway Commissioner Fitzpatrick, and O’Calla-
ghan, Chief Commissioner of Police, had a very
bad quarter of an hour at the second strike
Cabinet meeting. Fitzpatrick, it is alleged, was
told to send in his resignation or make the wheels
move, all Bent’s yells having failed. The whole
of the civil service was with the strikers, but the
press-manufactured “public opinion’’ was too
strong, and intimidation carried the day.
An auction advertisement in S.M. Herald
of recent date recalls a very eminent Australian
scientist: “By order of the executors of Mrs.
Priddle, will be sold,” &c. Mrs. Priddle was the
widow of an old-time St. Luke’s parson (Liver-
pool, N.S.W.), her first husband being the eminent
scientist, Dr. George Bennett, of Bourke-st.,
Woolloomooloo, who died in the 90’s at the age of
86 years. Dr. Bennett first came to N.S.W. in
1828. He was one of two experts.appointed by
Judge Burton to inquire into the mental condition
of the notorious John Knatclibull, who was
hanged in 1844 for the murder of a widow named
Jamieson, at the corner of Kent-st. and Margaret-
place. Robert Lowe’s defence of this malefactor
was “emotional insanity.”
About a fallen king :
Mahuta, last of the brown kings, has swapped his crown
for a membership in Seddon’s Executive and a seat in the
Legislative Council. Perhaps there isn’t as much poetry
about the new billet, but the pay is steadier —a regular
salary is provided for. Only a few of the Ngatimaniapoto
tribe held out till the last; these, led by Patu Patu,
turned up at Government House before the swearing-in,
and chanted a weird song to the effect that Mahuta was
going to say good-bye to kingship and power, and
was selling himself to the pakeha for cash. Mahuta,
who drove down in a cab with Seddon, went across, and
argued ; but it evidently wasn’t a conclusive argument,
for the malcontents still threw mud at him in song.
Next day there was a Gazette notice announcing the
appointment of “Mahuta Potatau Tawhiao Te Whero-
whero, known as King Mahuta, descendant of Potatau
and Tawhiao, formerly known as Maori King.” If Taw-
hiao had cared, he could have had greater honors from
the pakeha than have come the way of Mahuta, nis son—
Native Minister Donald M’Leod would have made him
the equal of an Indian prince ; and afterwards Governor
Onslow tempted him with a large pension. But Tawhiao
was an old man then, and, though he looked at the pen-
sion very hard, he decided to let his son take the final
plunge if it seemed to him good.
, Sydney Telegraph on its useless, bab-
bling tin-god and obstructionist, Pumpkin Smith :
Last session he gave the House four hours of it without
stopping. No man in Parliament can direct a stonewall
or can arrange the speeches for a debate with better
party effect than can Mr. Smith. He possesses the added
advantage that he can take a hand himself, and talk at
any length without exhaustion, scarcely with effort.
When the tariff was introduced it was necessary for
party purposes
Not in the interests of the country, be it observed,
but for the purposes of the importing party—
that one of the Freetraders should get up and speak
for nearly two hours. Mr. Winter Cooke, of Victoria, a
quiet, gentlemanly man, who had been in the Legislative
Council of his State for several years, and had never
spoken for more than a quarter of an hour, was put up to
complete the evening. Mr. Cooke negotiated the first ten
minutes ; then he began to slacken speed. In a quarter
of an hour he was hoisting signals of distress. In tv entv
minutes he was done. Mr. Sydney Smith suddenly had
to take up the unfinished task. He had left his notes at
home ;he had not even a quotation. For an hour and a
half he talked profusely about nothing. The ex-
hausted Mr. Cooke looked on in amazement. It was a
trifle to Mr. Sydney Smith. Next day he started again,
and talked for four hours, scarcely stopping to take
breath, and winding up almost as fresh as he began.
“It was a trifle to Mr. Sydney Smith.” He is
used to talking about nothing.
IF HAMLET CAME TO MELBOURNE.
“ Nay, good heralds! If ’twere a couple of liars
on different sides one might come by some
truth.”
Some notable June birthdays are :—Chief-
Justice Griffith (Queensland) 58 on June 21;
President Chaffey Baker, 61 on June 22, and
Premier Dick Seddon, 58 on the same day. Ex-
Premier Peacock (Vic.) was 42 and ex-Premier
Edward Braddon (Tas.) 74 on June 11, while ex-
Works Minister Burgovne, the doyen of the S.A.
Assembly, was 76 on June 10. Also Archbishop
Murphy, of Tasmania, will be 88 on June 18.
Some three years ago three N.S.W. priests
fell under the personal censure of Cardinal Moran
at St. Patrick’s College, Manly, and he threatened
suspension. Timely influence, however, prevented
that. All three are now dead. Father M'Glone
was accidentally killed while driving on the Blue
Mountains. Father Timoney, who got into
“ trouble ” in South Africa while he was acting as
military chaplain to one of the N.S. Wales con-
tingents, died of cancer in the throat within a few
months of reaching England. The third member
of the trio, Father Joseph Bunbury, ended his life
pathetically at the Royal Hotel.
WARNED OFF.
MR. LOCHHEAD (to deputation of owners and merchants):
“The masters were distinctly warned before they came
here that we could not give them trucks.” —Daily Paper.
About a dozen ships are lying idle in port for
want of trucks.
Passed out, at Bendigo (Vic.), JohnKeam,
one of the oldest of the old school of mine mana-
gers, who brought the Garden Gully from obscur-
ity to the front rank of div.-payers.
English mails bring information that Vic-
toria’s old friend, W. T. Carter, ex-M.L.A. for
Williamstown, ex-parson, inventor, anti-
vaccinationist, etc., is still taking a
lively interest in politics. In the long
ago W.T. preached in a S.A. kirk,
but, unable to agree with the flock
of the pious State, drifted to Williams-
town and into Vic. Parliament.
Toiltd for many a day trying to get
an serial motor to mote, but in vain.
' The law got down on him several
times for having , his children un-
vaccinated, but Carter stuck to
his beliefs, and paid the fines
imposed. At latest advices, he
had been shouting in the
Chamberlain interest in
Cornwall, and the miners
had been throwing *dag
or jeers at him.
A solicitor’s clerk
who, in the tem-
porary absence of his
principal, tried to
keep a case going
in a Sydney police
court, a little while
ago, was pointedly
snubbed. Some
years ago it was
quite a common
thing for clerks to
take a hand in the
court business
without drawing
any comment from
the Bench. The
late Chief Justice
Martin used to tell
how, when him-
self clerk to Bob
Nicoll, he ruled the
court for the better part
of an hour. The magistrate at last violently shut
the juvenile up, but healed the trouble by inviting
him to “a glass of wine” when the court closed.
Richard Smith, of Canterbury (N.S.W.),
died last week at the reputed age of 107 years.
The record sets out that he was born in Wiltshire
(England) in 1796, and enlisted in the 50th Regi-
ment 90 years ago; that he came to Australia
with the 12th Regiment in 1835; and afterwards
joined the police force in which he served for 23
years, retiring in 1860 at the age of 64. Later on
he kept hotel at Braidwood (N.S.W.) for 15 years,
and then put in about a similar period farming at
Queanbeyan. He never wore glasses, and died with
all his teeth still sound. Also teetotallers may
note the shocking fact that he smoked heavily and
drank a moderate quantity of spirits regularly till
he was 100. Then he knocked off both indul-
gences, and the fact that he lived the best part of
100 years with the aid of spirits and tobacco, and
only seven years without them, may possibly tend
to show the deadly results of total abstinence.
As a general thing there is a haze of doubt about
the age of alleged centenarians, but Richard
Smith’s case seems to rest on better evidence than
usual.
There’s a priest in a Blue Mountain
(N.S.W.) town who is so much given to being
carried away with the exuber-
ance of his own verbosity that
he has instructed a faithful
servitor to allow him 20 minutes
for his sermon, and then to ring
a bell. At the bell the iermon
stops, whether it has reached
thirdly, fourthly, or lastly. Some
of his co-religionisms are anxious
to bring that servitor and his
bell down to Sydney to attend
on Cardinal Moran and gi\ e him
a warning when he is saying
foolish things. It is a pity to
heara man who can saya straight
thing blathering over sectarian
squabbles.
There are 31 retired colo-
nial Anglican Bishops resident
in England, 10 being from Au--
tralasia. This importing and exporting of tem-
porary prelates begins to look like foolishness.
The new pulpit set up in St. James’s,
Sydney, to the memory of Edward Deas Thom-
son, recalls an honorable and notable early Aus-
tralian. Deas Thomson was of the clerkly order
of mind, and of most methodical habits, but he
woke up to some fine political speeches in the old
Legislative Council, and he helped Wentworth
to carry the Constitution Act through the British
Parliament. He married a daughter of Governor
Bourke in 1833 in St. James’s Church. Went-
worth intended Thomson to be first Premier
under Responsible Government, but intrigues
were numerous, and Stuart Donaldson won the
honor, which he held for less than three months.
Deas Thomson is notable as the man who abolished
the preferential tariff in favor of British goods.
For 22 years before his time all foreign goods
other than liquor and tobacco paid 5 per cen'.
duty, British goods being free; foreign liquor
paid 2s. per gallon more than British.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
NEARSIGHTED AND INTOXICATED VISITOR (at
Zoo): “Serves yer right. Yer a (hie) divil
ter use obscene language when yer (hie)
speechless drunk. How (hie) longsh the
sintince? ”
“Scotty the Vvrinkler”: You will give
me, dear 8., just this one shot at “Flap Doodle.”
He cannot have read the epitome of my life (with
portrait) published by you. I take exception to
his (“ J.F.D.’s) last sentence (B. 16/5/’O3): —
It’s nothing to boast of. certainly, but I have had a
wider and more varied experience among smart spielers
(not thimble-and-pea men and country takedowns) than
"6xB” and “The Wrinkler ” and “ The Wrinkler’s” dog
thrown in.
Now I ask if he was with me at the R.M.A., at
Warley, in India, Abyssinia, Egypt, Woolwich,
Gibraltar, the States and Texas ; and a good part
of Spain and Portugal? They areall spielers there.
How "J.F.D.” knows all I have done in 59
years I can’t tell. “6 xB”is a friend of mine,
and not a gambler, only an occasional kippist.
Surely our know-all can get someone to see his
hand and back him, if I throw in a point or two.
Here are some of the items I’ll back myself in
against the man wlio knows so well the range of
my capability : Any game of cards, barring euchre
and forty-fives. I don’t play the former since I
saw Tyson’s blacks at it for nuggets of twist. The
other my knuckles won’t stand and I fail in the
awful necessary grimaces. Pigeon - shooting,
rifle ditto, pistol ditto (I’ll fire from the
hip), fencing with foils (we oan nip off
the buttons if “ J.F.D.” cares for it). I
am still too weak, after six months’ illness,
to use the sticks or gloves. I’ll ride old Julia
Pastrana (22 years old) against any bona fide
owned nag belonging to “ J.F.D.”, any hurdle
course from here to Moss Vale. I ’ll dress fly-hooks
(salmon to midge on single horse-hair) against him.
If his sport and spieling are only theoretical, per-
haps he’ll tackle mein ancient languages—Latin,
Greek, Sanscrit; or modern French, Spanish and
Hindustani. Or in art: oil, water, monochrome,
chalks, pencil. Or in science: mathematics,
up to the differential and integral calculi, plan-
drawing, descriptive geometry, surveying, artillery,
fortification, or in military matters. Any three
of these —he picks one, I pick the next, toss up
for choice of third. But the bootless bummer of
Druitt-street is not to be umpire. By the way, I
have not owned a detached collar since I was a
boy. I never wore a celluloid one in my life.
And, as regards my dog, there are only eight of
him. A man who writes the above-quoted
sentence talks through his neck.

“Shaker” : Some years ago, The Bul-
letin remarked that the party in charge of the
rain department of Providence seemed to be a
lamentably bad shot; well, there doesn’t seem to
be much improvement yet. Parts of N.S.W. —
in which State days of humiliation and prayer for
rain have become an established institution
during the past two years—are still suffering
from drought; while, in the Cape York Penin-
sula, where the people never pray at all, but
swear something extra, it has practically been
raining every day this year so far, with falls up
to 18 inohes in 24 hours, and some of the small
townships are in danger of becoming lost in the
grass. Really, the prayer for rain party ought
to include a strong remonstranoe in next special
services.

A lambing-down shanty in real life :
Bully kept the pub. In his way Bully was ft casuist.
He considered if a swagman was inclined to drink he
might as well drink at his shanty as in Melbourne. He
would not have so far to walk back again. In this Bully
was warmly supported by Geordie, the blacksmith, as he
was the only man available to make even the pretence of
helping to drink a cheque when it happened to come
along. Nothing surprised Bully. You might walk into
the bar with a cheque for £lOO, throw it on the counter,
and ask him if he could change it. “ Oh, yes,” he would
gay, “ what are you going to have ? ” After you had had
your drink some time, he would come out and tell you he
hadn’t quite enough change, but the man with the water
cart would be back soon (a creature of Bully’s imagination
only), and then he would be able to square it up with
him. Then Geordie’s turn came on. He would drop in
quite promiscuously, call for a whisky, take no notice of
the new arrival, and challenge Bully to a game of crib.
Bully was off—but perhaps the stranger would, while he
was waiting for Jack to come back with the water cart.
Nine times out of ten the stranger would, as most
swagmen are insatiable cribbage players. Before he
started playing he would have a drink with Geordie.
By this time the swagman would be feeling tolerably
comfortable after his walk of 20 miles or so and the
whisky ; but if he was a particularly determined swag-
man he would, perhaps, think about getting on the road,
and ask Bully if the man with the water-cart would be
back soon. Bully did not know what was keeping him.
Geordie would suggest that the old horse had perhaps
stuck him up. Then the swagman would find that it was
too late to go on the road again that day, as the next
water was about ten miles off ; if time was an object he
would console himself with the thought that he could
take the coach to the railway next morning. Having
won the game of cribbage he would probably ask Bully
and Geordie to have a drink, and would inform Bully
that he would camp there that night and go on by the
coach, giving a strict injunction to waken him when the
coach came along.
If he was a man inclined to drink at all, next morning
he would find himself in bed at Bully’s, with empty
bottles all round, and a very hazy idea of what had occurred
the night before. Bully would not be about. Bully had
to be up all night attending to the coaches and would
not be out of bed till 11 o’clock.
Presently Geordie would turn up for his morning dram,
and tell him what a glorious time they had had the
previous night. The swagman is principally concerned
about his money. But a few more whiskies, and he
feels that he is himself again, and by the time Bully
puts in an appearance, is in a much better humor; in
fact, he is just about ready for another sleep. He asks
Bully about his money, and he is told that he is too
drunk to settle up with just now, to have another
drink, goto bed and have a sleep.
In the meantime Bully has sent the cheque by the
mailman for collection, and will receive the cash that
night. There is really no necessity for hurry, as two
days of Bully’s whisky would be too much for any one.
It only takes a day to get drunk certainly, but fully a
fortnight to get sober again.
But Bully, for all his scheming, was considered not a
bad sort by the swagmen generally, as the hard-up could
always get a bit of bread and meat, and Bully never
allowed a man who had spent much money in his house
to leave absolutely broke. Two or three days before he
intended to give them their walking-ticket he would
tell them to square themselves up, and taper off the
whisky supply, and when they left would give them a
bottle of whisky and a couple of pounds to see them to
the next job.

“ Walter H. Rose ” : My idea of a trans-
continental railway route (from a personal know-
ledge of the country, most of which I have
travelled overland): A line to run from Bourke
via Thargomindah-Windorah-Bedouin, about 60
miles south of Camooweal; Burnette Downs to
Katherine, to Pine Greek. From Bedouin,
a branch to run to Hergott Springs (Adelaide
and Melbourne traffic). This route passes through
either mineral, pastoral, or agricultural lands, and
would at least have a chance to pay interest on
the cost, besides the population it would support
along the different lines, and is all through watered
country. If this line had been in existence during
this late awful drought, millions of starving stock
could have been trucked away out to the West or
Barclay’s Tableland, where grass and water were
more plentiful.

THE NEW-CHUM: “ But, dash it all! if you

what the dooce does your wife do?”
Reported thatE. O. Robinson—Australia’s
“ Buffalo Bill ” —has sold his property, Melville
Island, together with 60,000 buffaloes depasturing
there, to a Vancouver syndicate. It was offered
12 months ago in Melbourne, but failed to find a
purchaser. There should be a good thing in
buffaloes just now. E. Holmes, of Port Darwin,
has lately contracted to supply several pearling
parties with 30 tons of barrelled buffalo per
month; and he hopes that some use will be made
of the hundreds of thousands of these animals that
are annually slaughtered just for their horns and
hides in the Northern Territory.

“M.R.”: In a corner of my garden I
found a nest of large red ants, I decided
not to disturb them, and
for quite twelve months
we worked together on a
most friendly footing. I
dug within a foot of the
nest, the ants crawling over
the newly turned ground,
evidently seeking insects,
&c., often passing over my
boots; not infrequently 1
picked an ant up in my
hands accidentally while
weeding. One day, how-
ever, I inadvertently cut
one of the ants in two with
the hoe; in less than a
minute war was declared
and the whole nest attacked
me. I had to beat a hasty
retreat with half a dozen
stings, nor have I been able
to approach that part of
the garden since though it
is nearly two years since
they declared war. They
will often come 25 yards
when they hear the chip-
ping of the hoe, always
angry, aggressive and unforgiving. [Next!]

“Yarrum”: Once saw a German cocky
with a pair of bullocks trying to drag a log into his
yard. The bulls jibbed at a bit of a hill, and
couldn’t be persuaded to move another yard.
Then Hans took yokes and bows off, turned the
cattle adrift, and sang out for his old woman;
and the two, with spare chain over shoulders and
lifting together, had the log home in no time. The
oxen, the man explained, “ vas alvays a drifle veak
dis dime of de year, unless dey vos fed up.” He
added that when his frau (who was Irish) got her
toes in she could shift as much as any two men of
his acquaintance. She looked it.
A Westralian town
being recently beauti-
fied by a park, a night-
watchman was appoin-
ted, in the interests
of respectability, to
evict all persons found
therein after dark. Evi-
dently the billet is no
sinecure, for the care-
taker recently re-
marked to the local
editor: “A cove wants
to be pretty sharp ter
stalk some of these
parties ; and what with
a bloke in a brown
suit lookin’ like a tree,
and a girl in green
lookin’ like a busn, it’s
no soft snap gettin’ em
all chucked out on to
time. Bein’ short-
sighted, too, I’ve had
to ’ave recourse to
strategy ; so I gets a
long pole with a sharp
point, and when I sus-
pects there’s a pair
sittin’ talkin’ among
the bushes, I jabs my
pole in hard. Only
last night that very
thing happened, but as
I pulled the pole out
I thought it felt a bit
heavy. I hadn’t time
to examine it, however,
for just then a young
fellow pops up on the
other side of the bushes
and shouts, ‘ Here,
that’s my girl when
you’ve done with her ! ’
‘Where’s yer girl’’
sez I. ‘There,’ sez
he, pointin’ over;
‘ you’ve got her hooked
on that infernal stick
o’ yourn.’ The pole
had pone clean through
her frock, and it was a few
minutes before I could shake
her off.”
“ T. 8.” inquires :
Dear Bulletin, —Would you be kind enough to tell me
what is a fair average day’s shearing for a man with a
machine ? Do you know of any man on his own shearing
over 300 sheep in one day ?
Will one or two—not 250—truthful persons please

“Bunny”: The snagging operations in
the Darling are a disgrace, and a revenue-consumer
of 40 h.p. Time after time one sees huge logs
dragged up and left to lie on the banks of the
river, so that the first rise of any dimensions
sweeps them back into the river again. A firing
party should follow each snagging party. Of
course, the logs will not burn well as soon as they
come out of the river, but in this rainless climate
they soon dry. Twice just before this last rise, I
saw a snagging party hauling up logs and debris
from a part of the river bed that was absolutely
dry. Surely these were occasions that called for
burning-off.' This style of providing plenty future
work for snagpers is what makes outback folk jeer
at Governme . jobs.

“ Alpar ” tells a true fish yarn :
A few of us had made a night of it at an up-country
(N.S.W.) pub., and, in the morning, we pulled down the
creek to cool our heads. At the lake entrance, we struck
a fish-trap (large floating box), holding three immense
cod, trapped the night before. We chased the biggest
fellow around till we caught him, and tied a blue ribbon
to his tail. At the ensuing races, Brown (fisherman)
exhibited the “ remarkable fish," but couldn’t get any-
body to believe that he hadn’t tied on the ribbon himself.
Since then, he has been regarded as the biggest liar in
the district; and hearing, the other day, that this repu-
tation had lost him a J.P.ship, my conscience smote me,
so that I wrote and explained the "joke.” Yesterday, I
received an open postcard from him, intimating that I
am a liar ; so when we meet there will probably be
trouble.
THE GAIETY OF BIRDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
« i feel as gay as a bird.”— Vic. Railway Minister Bent.
I have seen the eagles swoop
On the dying lambs below ;
I have seen the black crows stoop
To the,feast of eyes, and oh !
I do think I understand
All the meaning of his words—
Yea, I know their gaiety—
Blinding gaiety—of birds.
I have heard the buzzards scream
Dashing down from overhead,
And have seen the vultures teem
Round the faces of the dead.
I have seen the birds at work
’Mid the wretched flocks and herds,
And I know the gaiety—
Gory gaiety—of birds.
Tis the crimsoned gaiety
Of the sharp, blood-spattered claw ;
’Tis the screaming, hellish glee
Of the things that rend and gnaw !
’Tis the joke of crow and hawk,
Tearing beating hearts in shreds ;
Ah, I ken their gaiety—
CursM gaiety—of birds.
For the screaming hawk is gay,
Shrilling sated in the sky ;
And the vulture wings away
With a dull and heavy eye ;
And the full crow lazily
Calls his hungry mates from far,
And they haste in ecstasy
To the saturnalia 1
So I think I understand
All the meaning of his words,
And I dread Bent’s gaiety—
Gory gaiety—of birds.

it in a glass case in the sho-v window, two lively

Phillips the town loafer, a played-out Chinese gardener,
and a lady of pleasure—the only one the place possessed
They brought her home, and she remonstrated with Dad
and Mother in passing. Her language was terrible; Mother
said she beat the fishwoman that attacked Dan O’Connell.
During the next month the Army denounced Dad as a
bigoted Roman, who wanted to persecute them, and Billy
Phillips walked up as far as our house and challenged
Dad to mortal combat, while Dan fought seven rounds
with the Chinaman in the main street and narrowly
escaped with a fine. They were all good chaps living
near us, and they sympathised with Dad, came round
every half-hour to talk the matter over and ask him for
the hundredth time how he was fool enough to let them in.
Finally, the Army left on a magistrate’s order. The court
case cost Dad £1 Bs. They owed seven weeks’ rent, and
it cost £1 to exorcise the house before we moved in, and
little Paddy was nearly blinded through getting a splash
of holy water in his eye. The converts all relapsed soon
afterwards.

“Steele Rudd”; Barbara Suther-
land is right—all way-back settlers don’t
wear short trousers and long beards;
neither have all their women folk big feet
and frowsy heads. And surely no in-
telligent reader ever thought otherwise ?
Cropped beards, clean shaves, small feet,
well-dressed people, good-looking girls,
even false teeth, are plentiful enough in
the bush. But the fact of these existing
doesn’t «djsprove the presence of the other
fellow. And the reason they’re not written
up is, I suppose, because they are not
characters —because they don’t do any-
thing, or say anything, or look anything
worth ink. Of course you can’t get a
character representative of the broad
bush any more than you can produce a
national novel, or a national suit of
pyjamas. And I fail to see that a lady
has any cause to come out in her bare feet
and shriek because some bush people are
credited with dropping an “h ” or a “g”,
any more than the politicians _of the
several States would be justified in hunt-
ing round for “Hop” with a shot-gun
when that artist caricatures G. H. Reid
as a person with an eye-glass and no legs
and a violent tendency to evolve into a
turnip.

“ Meteor ” : Talk about big mos-
quitoes ! There was a jackeroo on the
Culgoa once who caught an immense
“skeeter ” out in a swamp near the border-
fence, and after a terrible struggle suc-
ceeded in tying him to the pommel with
a pair of saddle-straps. Halting for dinner,
he tied his horse to a piece of old wire-
fence while he went off to fill his “shay ”
at the creek. Meantime the “skeeter”
managed to get both wings loose, the
result of which was that the jackeroo had
to foot it back to the head-station and
report the disappearance of his cuddy;
which was afterwards found 6 miles away,
feeding unconcernedly, with the wire-
fence still hanging to the bridle. After
flying that far with the horse, the
“skeeter” had escaped through the
“ D’s” being wrenched out of the saddle.

Bobby Brown is aboriginal king of
Lake Tyers (Gippsland, Vic.), and his last
visible relio of a vast legendary kingdom
is a brass plate (proclaiming on one side his royal
estate and on the other the virtues of a patent
medicine), which he wears on his manly bosom.
Bobby Rex attended a late Bairnsdale horse sale,
and was present when a “gunner’’was knocked
down for £45. “ Mine gib it dis one brazz plate
for a horse like it dat peller,” said Bobby Brown,
who thereby became a kind of unconscious
aboriginal Shakspearean monarch, desirous of
swapping his kingdom for a horse.
Overheard from a Westralian squatter of
excellent family”: “Yes; but the worst of it
was that after I did knock him down, I had only
these light kid boots on ; and of they’re no
dam good to kick a nigger with.”
A GOVE YOU USETER KNOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
He only lives in fancy, yet
You love him passing well,
He is a mate you’ll ne’er forget
Whose deeds no pen can tell ;
Though there were giants on the earth
In days long, long ago,
He was a dozen giants worth—
A cove you useter know.
You’re seated in a shanty where
The liars congregate ;
You simply lie back in your chair,
And peacefully you wait.
Then when the yarns begin to fail
And lose their cheerful flow,
You tell again his fearsome tale —
This cove you useter know.
Or in the shearers’ hut at night,
Amongst the other men,
With tallies rising left and right
As big guns “ ring” again,
When someone springs it extra high,
Two hundred rams or so,
You’ll swear you saw it beaten by—
A cove you useter know.
You knew a horse that never shirked
A fence of any weight;
You knew a collie pup that worked
Sleep-walking through the night;
A bird that knitted with its claws,
And knitted none too slow-;
The man that owned these wonders was
A cove you useter know.
With rails to rattle, spars to break,
Unwilling nags to “ send,”
With flooded creeks and risks to take,
And mighty cheques to spend,
With wild man-eating colts to ride,
And thirsty tracks to go,
There’s none can stand a chance beside
A cove you useter know.
He’s quite imaginary—just
A mythologic bloke,
The friend of days of lurid “ bust “
And days when you were broke,
And yet you love him, and your eyes
With real affection glow,
As you his mighty deeds apprise—
This cove you useter know.

A strike incident. A big striker was
speaking to an engine-man, trying to induce
him to leave the kettle alone, when one of the
bespectacled University “special police’ came
along and ordered him to desist. The striker
gazed in a fatherly manner on the interrupter for
a moment, and then caught him up in his arms
and gently lifted him over the station fence.
After that he continued his speech with the
driver in peace, though seven stone of dignity,
special constable and spectacles raged outside the
fence.
The Melbourne people rushed to feast and
flatter the ‘brave little Japs,’ but they grudge
a living wage to heroes nearer home, as seen by
their attitude towards our own railway men, who
risk life and limb in the Public Service as sturdily
as the fiercest foreign fire-eater of them all.
Within the last few days two guards have fallen
at their posts, and scarcely a week passes without
a ‘ railway case’ for hospital or morgue. One of
the latest was maimed for life in a collision
between suburban trains at 5 o clock on a foggy
morning. The other, examining the couplings of
his midnight 4 goods,* mot with a* dreadful death.
Day after, I heard inmates of a cushioned first-
class compartment describe railway men as ‘ pam-
pered ’ and ‘ over-paid.’
“J.F.D.”: I live in a house where the
rooms are let empty to married couples that bring
their own furniture. I call it “Commonwealth
House,” because the people are from so many
States. There are six rooms let. and their occu-
pants pay as follows: New South Wales, front
balcony bedroom (I live there), Bs. weekly; Vic-
toria, front bedroom downstairs, 75.; South
Australia, back ground floor, 6s. ; Queens-
land, back first floor, ss. 6d. ; Westralia and
Tasmania, back rooms overlooking the yard,
4s each. The landlady sleeps in the attic; her
name is Barton. I call the attic the Federal
capital. The rent of the house is 235. weekly, so
you see the Commonwealth tariff gives a
surplus of 11s. 6d., besides the use of the
Federal capital. The bathroom, kitchen, and
washhouse are Commonwealth property. There
i 3 a fat wench with a merry eye and a glib
tongue who does odd jobs for the occu-
pants of the different States, and charges high,
too. She runs Barton down behind her back,
makes faces at her, &c., so I have christened her
George Reid. She works mostly for N.S.W.
THE SHUNTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The engine-bars are splashed and starr’d —
They've kiUed a shunter in the yard.
“ He never seen how he was struck.
And he died sudden,” someone said.
The driver coughed— “ That flamin’ truck
Come on the slant and struck him dead.”
The fireman choked and growled “ Hard luck !
As he was carried to the shed.
The engine whistles short and low
(His blood is on her ‘ catcher-bars’).
We had to let his young wife know
His soul had passed beyond the stars,
Where he will hear no engines blow,
Nor listen for the coming cars.
She stared and stared—until he came.
On four men’s shoulders, up the hill.
She sobbed and laughed and called his name,
And shivered when he lay so still —
She had no cruel words of blame —
She bore no one of us ill-will.
They’ve washed the rails and sprinkled sand.
(Oh ! hear the mail go roaring on !)
And he was just a railway hand—
A hidden star that never shone—
And no one seems to understand
Her heart is broken ! He is gone !
The engine-bars are cold and hard
They've killed a shunter in the yard.

MARTELLS
THREE STAR
The Frown of Cohen.
It is only a reasonable thing that a people which
takes its means of subsistence from Cohen should
in time have to also take its politios from Cohen.
The man who goes too often to the pawnshop
with his houses and lands and chattels must one
day leave his soul in pop there, too. Sydney
Daily Telegraph’s appeal to the Tamwortn
electors to eleot Garland as a means of placating
the London money-lender wasn’t merely a dis-
reputable trick of vote-canvassing ; it was a warn-
ing of what will come in the near future as the
logical complement of a borrowing polioy, when
well be required to pay up to Cohen not only the
interest due but also our political and social inde-
pendence. A. recent incident in S’African politics
shows how general is the view among the London
money-lenders that, in return for their ducats,
they should have some voice in the governmeut
of the countries to which they lend. In January,
1903, the Cape Colony Government proposed to
float’s loan, whereupon a Mr. Wankltn, M.P.,
wrote to the papers, and fussed about generally,
with the argument that, because Cape Colony
was not Jingo in its politics, it should not get any
loans until it changed its mind and became
devoutly Jingo. Now, in a further letter to the
press, Mr. Wankltn, M.P., olaims—
This suggestion of mine led to the withdrawal of the
loan which the Government of the Cape proposed to
issue in January, and Mr. Jan Hofmeyr, the President of
the Afrikander Bond, has issued a manifesto to his sup-
porters, imploring them to abandon boycotting and other
evil practices on the ground mainly that by indulgence in
them they are interfering with the material prosperity of
the Cape.
I should like to give a word of advice to the people of
Cape Colony in all goodwill, and to say, “ Do not
attempt to issue any fresh loan until after the general
election, which must take place in Ootober at the latest.”
If any attempt is made to borrow before the general
election the people of the Cape may have to pay dearly
for it, and it is possible to buy money at too high a price.
If the voters at the Cape will continue to give us proofs
of active loyalty, if they will really come together as one
people, and if they will offer us after their general elec-
tion a Ministry in which we can have confidence, we shall
be delighted to once more resume business negotiations
with them, and to hope for their future prosperity.
Mr. Wankltn may be, doubtless is, the sort of
bird that clucks more than it lays ; his statement
that his letter was responsible for the withdrawal
of the Cape Colony loan may be largely unwar-
ranted assumption. But it is quite clear that the
alternative he sets before Cape Colony—alter
your politics or do without our money—is one
that will commend itself to the London Cohens.
Australia in the near future may be given the
option of abandoning her “ white ” policy and
much of her political and economic liberty in re-
turn for a continuance of the loan “dope,” to which
pernicious custom has habituated her constitu-
tion. Already such a degraded bargain has been
suggested by one of the “ great ” Sydney dailies ;
its general advocacy by the importing, borrowing
classes is only a matter of time. And its accept-
ance? Well, if Australia continues to borrow,
that seems ultimately inevitable—that or repu-
diation.
Britain's Food Supply.
Britain begins to grow seriously alarmed at the
decay of local agriculture under Freetrade, and
at its position as a country which could be starved
out after a month or two of war. It isn’t even a
question now of keeping command of the sea;
Britain might have command of the sea and be
famine-stricken all the same. The United States
alone supplies more than half the bread of
Britain, and a war with the U.S., which would
necessarily make that country stop supplies,
would mean famine. A simultaneous war with
the U.S., Russia, and Argentina, even if Britain
could sweep every vessel of these three Powers
from the sea, would very nearly mean death. To
quote a recent manifesto issued by the corn-mer-
chants of England :
We, the undersigned, concur in the opinion that, if
Great Britain should become involved in a European war,
the country must be prepared to see bread at practically
famine prices. We base our opinion on the following
reasons:
1. The experience of the Napoleonic and Crimean wars,
during each of which, though we possessed full command
of the sea, the price of wheat rose enormously.
2. As late as the Crimean war we were almost self-
supporting, but we now import four-fifths of our wheat.
3. The chief source of our supply is the United States ;
but the price of wheat on the American corn mark< t can
be raised artificially, and in the event of a European war
in which Great Britain was involved, it is quite possible,
indeed probable, that it would be so raised.
Britain could grow its own wheat supply and
avoid this danger if it would, but the doctrine of
the beauty of importing has eaten into its soul,
and a huge proportion of its area which should be
devoted to food-raising is allowed to be set aside
for the idle pleasure of a few titled drones. The
Duke of Sutherland draws £140,000 a year from
his landed possessions, and he has cut up the
county of Sutherland, of which he i 3 the virtual
owner, into 51 shooting-grounds, which bring
him in a gross rental of £20,000 a year. The
Duke of Westminster rents from brother dukes
116,000 acres in Scotland, for which he pays
,£12,000 a year, while the Duke of Fife
has let the whole forest of Mar (81,000
acres) at a rental of £lO,OOO a year.
All these lands, and many other huge areas, are
withdrawn from cultivation, in order that they
may be used for fowl-murdering purposes; and
their population has been driven away. The map
in the Statesman’s Year Book for 1902 marks
nearly half Scotland as uninhabited and set aside
for the growth of birds and wild animals. And
meanwhile the British food supply becomes more
precarious, and the time grows nearer when a
bigger Pierpont Morgan, merely by organising
an international wheat nng, can starve Britain
into submission without war.
The Teachings of Kembla.
Fob years past N.S.W. has been drifting into the
habit of throwing the responsibility for mining
accidents upon Government inspectors. Ihe re-
sult showed itself at Mt. Kembla, as described in
the Commission’s report; and it has shown itself
in just the same way at a hundred other places.
Managers rely upon inspectors to draw attention
to dangers ; and the inspectors, with a dozen, or
perhaps 60, mines in their districts, can t, o
course, see to everything. And even it they
could, the inspector, who has only passed a very
junior sort of examination in mine-engineering
who isn’t even always graded as a P r ° tes '
sional in the service—and who can t \ery
well be expected to be any better a man than his
poor salary of £3OO a year will buy, isn t likely to
interfere much with the methods of a g .
trained manager drawing, perhaps, £looo
a year. The big man is paid the big salary
because he is supposed to know just

spector cannot always be on hand, and since it
isn’t desirable that he should interfere to any
great extent even when he is on hand, it is foolish
to load him with the responsibility in case things
go wrong. That man should have the responsi-
bility who is, or should be, always on the pre-
mises ; and that man is the manager and nobody
else. He is the man who is responsible for
the way in which the mine is worked —for the
methods adopted, the machinery used, and all the
rest —and every effort and every inclination to
shift one ounce of the responsibility from him
ought to be resisted most stubbornly. When it is
made unmistakably plain that the manager and
nobody but the manager will be held personally
responsible for the accidents that happen, the
manager will take all sorts of care that accidents
don’t happen ; and we won’t have the sorry state
of drift and let-things-slide that apparently pre-
vailed at Mt. Kembla.
The Martell Case.
Justice a’Beckett’s lengthy and lucid decision
in Melb. Supreme Court lately, in what was
known as the Martell case, administered a
severe shock in the eye to the Victorian Federated
Employers, and practically vindicated the union-
ist’s right to dictate the terms on which he, as a
unionist, will accept employment, just as his em-
ployer lays down the terms on which he will
employ the other. Briefly, Martell, a gold-
miner, blacklegged at Eldorado (Vie.) during a
strike some years back, during which time he
acted as Argus correspondent, thereafter resign-
ing his membership of the A.M.A. Then he
went to Outtrim, got employment in the local
coal mine and joined the Vic. Coal-Miners’ Asso-
ciation. His fellow unionists soon learnt of his
previous doings, discarded him from the associa-
tion, and told the manager that if Martell con-
tinued in the company’s employ they would strike.
They did so strike! Martell was dismissed
and refused further employment, and the union-
ists then resumed work. Thereupon the Federated
Employers’ Unions took the case up, found
Martell a billet as steward at their club-rooms
at £2 10s. a week, and found most of the money
to fight the case. The gist of his Honor’s
judgment was that “he had not _ to
consider whether they (the unionists, indi-
vidually as well as collectively) showed
ill-will towards plaintiff, but whether their deter-
mining motive was a desire to injure him or to
inflict on him some personal loss or injury. . . .
The question of law, which was a difficult one,
had been thoroughly argued out, and he read
the lengthy judgments referred to. Relying on
the (English) case of Allen v. Flood he held that
a mere intimation to the employers by defendants
that they would not work if other persons were
employed or retained in their employment, would
not give those persons a right of action, where the
intimation was not given with the object of
gratifying malice felt towards those persons or
prompted by a desire to injure them, but with a
desire to strengthen their own combination. . . .
He did not think defendants were actuated by
malice or spite, but acted simply in the interests of
the union they served. It was done for the purpose
of doing that for which they were constituted.”
Judgment for defendants, with costs, and another
nail driven in the freedom-of-contract coffin.

A Deputation.
There were a great many beauty spots about Sj T dney,
and these acted as temptations. He had observed the
thousands of people who thronged the Circular Quay
when they should be at home or worshipping God.—Rev.
George Lane at a recent Wesleyan conference (Sydney
D.T. report).
A deputation waited upon Premier See,, the
other day, to bring before him the grave perils to
the community arising from the existence of so
many beauty spots around Sydney. Those present
were thoroughly representative of the Calvinist
feeling. In a lengthy speech, the Leader of the
Deputation pointed to the awful immorality, the
drinking habits, and, worse than all, the per-
nicious gaiety fostered by the harbor fore-
shores. Young men and women, and sometimes
old men and women, went walking, driving, or
boating to various beautiful spots, and the con-
sequences were so shocking as to make a highly
interesting narrative. From the observations of
the Rev. Joshua Meeke. by telescope and other-
wise, it had been ascertained — (The Bulletin is
obliged to omit what had been ascertained). The
worst feature of the matter was the heathenish
gaiety which marked these parties. Even where
close and long-continued observation failed to
disclose any particular immorality, the ear was
shocked by profane laughter and pagan merriment.
It was a reproach to tne sober and decorous that
these things should be ——
Premier See (interrupting): “ Yes, gentlemen,
but what do you propose to do ? ”
The Leader of the Deputation : “ The remedy is
simple—the abolition of all these beauty spots.
The trees should be levelled to the ground, the
dancing pavilions destroyed, the flowers rooted up
and the sites of these picnicking resorts sown with
salt, according to Scriptural precedent. If the
Government were to further enclose the harbor
foreshores with a galvanised iron fence and allow
admittance within only on an order signed by four
clergymen to persons of approved decorum,
probably—
Premier See : “ But you can’t abolish vice ! ”
The Leader of the Deputation: “We admit
that, but we object to the conditions of
pagan gaiety under which it is carried on. Sin
exists by Divine ordinance, so that the good may
have the satisfaction of knowing that the wicked
shall burn. But the path of the transgressor
should be made hard and enclosed with a gal-
vanised iron fence. The wicked should not be
allowed to betake themselves to these spots and
flaunt their ribald gaiety in the face of the good.
It takes away all the satisfaction of being good.”
Premier See was just explaining that man was
the creature of his environment, that the pro-
posed desolation of the harbor would be a very
costly matter, and that, unfortunately, the supply
of loan money was low at present, when this
issue went to press.
Last week I took to my bed
With a cough and a cold in my head,
My friends were all sighing, as they thought I
was dying,
But I banished all fears when I said ;
Bad cold I may have for sure,
But to die—that I will not endure ;
Just send for the stuff that will cure any cough,

An invariable feature of the daily press strike
news is the determined attempt to magnify small
accidents and incidents into “dastardly actions” and
“diabolical plots.” During the great Chicago Pullman
railway strike, 1894, the American press charged the
strikers with every species of crime and violence ; but
after the excitement an unbiassed Commission eulogised
the “dignified, manly, and conservative conduct” of the
strikers. t
* » * *
One of the most amusing features of the Melbourne
newspaper crusade against the railway men was the poor j
weak ‘Erald’s volte-face. The ’Erald started well on
the first day of the strike by giving a full and compre-
hensive account of the affair in all its bearings and with
all its incidents. When one of Bully Bent’s alleged
engine-drivers dropped his lead plug and bolted in terror
from his work, the ’Erald said so unrestrictedly. But
plain truth did not suit Irvine and the morning press
harpies,and it was allowed to leak out that the Argus
and Age were going to combine in bringing out a strike
evening paper. And just about the time that report got
about the ’Erald curled up, and began to forget to men-
tion sensational news items in connection with Bent’s
railways.

The linotype is an aw’kward animal to fool with.
While a Sydney paper was shrieking against the Vic. rail-
way “rebels,” it received a report which badly “kicked”
with the paper’s comments ; so, after the stuff had been
linotyped, a few lines were added to nullify the effect of
the report. In the old days of hand-setting, when small
jobs of that kind had to be done, the last line was simply
“picked up,” the addition made, and nobody outside
was any the wiser. But you can’t pick up a linotype
line and add to it ; if you want to drop in a “ not,” or
sprinkle your enemy’s speech with “ groans” and
“ dissent” at the last moment, the whole line has to be
reset ; and then sometimes the machine-operator forgets
to throw out the discarded line—the line with no
“groans” or “dissent” in it—and the two appear next
day at breakfast, one above the other, calling one
another a liar, and casting serious reflections on the
honesty of the office. And something like this happened
in the case mentioned.

“ 0.0. C.” : “ Great newspapers ” should strive to be
“ wells of English undefiled,” if they wish to retain the
respect of the people and make good their claim to
educate. But what do we find ? Their composition and
grammar are something lamentable ; plural nouns and
singular verbs, split infinitives, utterly inexcusable mis-
quotations, and hideous solecisms are common, not only
jn the “ news” but also the “ leading” cols. Two of the
most irritating blunders (because the most common and
uncalled-for) are the wretched Gibbonism “ and which,”
applied to the antecedent, and the misuse of will for
shall. Here is a beautiful sentence from the pen of a
man who should be a master of English—if only to keep
his paper as a literary as well as a news standard : [We
shall gladly comply with the request made by the rev.

THE PESSIMISTIC POET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I 'are my gloomy days, like other men,
Who’vs had their fill o’ fickle fortune’s knocks,
An’ drifted on the journalistic rocks,
To earn their tucker with a dubious pen.
Jane’s mother ran me on to litteryture—
Braggin’ about ’er son who wears fine clothes,
An’ keeps a sulky, an’ a ruby nose,
By writin’ poems for a kidney cure.
An’ so, at last, to gain a little peace,
I ’elped Jane's brother in me over-time—
CE’d got an order for a rod of rhyme
To advertise a patent axle-grease).
An’ all through that I lost a stiddy job
Of ’umpin’ bricks at six-and-six a day,
' For, deeply thinkin’ out a rhyme for “ dray,”
I dropped a hod-full on the boss’s nob.
An’, since that day, I’ve ’ad no luck at all—
For editors ’ave such bewilderin’ tricks,
That poets might as well be slingin’ bricks
Or bustin’ iron barks with wedge an’ maul.
Some coves “ decline with thanks” an’ some with scorn,
Some keep your screed until it’s out of date,
An’ fill the gentle poet’s soul with hate,
Makin’ 'im wish ’e never had been born.
Sometimes our screed’s too cold—sometimes too ’ot—
An’ O ! my brethren, ’ow it makes us curse
To see some other poet’s rocky verse
In print—when our superior stuff is not!
I ’ave my gloomy days, as I ’ave said,
When all my screed ’as missed the copy-file,
An’ Jane is at my elbow with a pile
Of beastly bills, which all good poets dread.
So I shall chuck it if the cashier fail*
To place upon ’is estimates a sum
That will repay me for this pome I’ve done,
An’ save me from a job at splittin’ rail*.

MALONEY'S MAGAZINE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Bowser : Country members would be placed at a
great disadvantage if Hansard was to be issued as before.
The present publication on Saturday permitted them to
read the speeches on Sunday afternoon.
Mr. Maloney hoped that the Government would some
day graft Hansard on to the Government Gazette, and
so "make a readable journal. At present nobody read the
Government Gazette from end to end, but if Hansard
was included and issued once or twice a week, there
would be a large number of subscribers.— Vie. Legisla-
tive Assembly Report.
On a tired and Mast nation
There has burst a revelation,
There has shone a light, refulgent and serene;
We acclaim it with elation —
’Tis our “literry ” salvation—
Maloney’s Illustrated Magazine.
To the stockman and the shearer
It is infinitely dearer
Than the wicked and irreverent Bulletin —
And the wisest seers and sages
Fondly dote upon its pages,
And seek knowledge in Maloney’s Magazine.
In its columns we shall get
All the Government Gazette,
With Hansard neatly sandwiched in between.
All “ Appointments” and “ Impoundings,”
"Tenders called for”—“Coastal Soundings,"
Will be pictured in Maloney’s Magazine.
It is full of fun and laughter,
With true pathos coming after ;
It is fearless—it is trenchant—it is keen ;
It abounds in tender pleading—
It is perfect Sunday reading—
Hurry up and buy Maloney’s Magazine !

POLITICAL
POINTS
William M‘Millan says that Minister
Kingston “set out with the idea that nine-tenths
of importers were rogues.” Well, aren’t they?
Liverpool (N.S.W.) School of Arts Debat-
ing Society has decided that “ A Labor party in
Parliament is a menace to Good Government.”
The Labor party may now put up its shutters.
“ Solidarity ” writes :
The ball is rolling ! One Melbourne firm that closed down
during strike, apparently to alienate sympathy of workers
from strikers, is re-admitting old employees on condition
that they leave the Union.
“ Kati-Kati ” : One of tire finest views in
Maoriland is that from the top of Mount Eden,
Auckland. You can see almost everything from
there, except the sense of paying current expenses
out of loans.
Old Allan M‘Lean, Rep. for Gippsland
(Vic.), on Alfred Deakin : “ After listening to the
Attorney-General’s speech, I feel sure that if the
Attorney-General tried, he could throw an attrac-
tive halo round the mouth of Hades itself.”
“Colonel” Mackay, who left the Lyne
Ministry in 1900 to go and whirl a comparatively
harmless sword in Africa, comes back to his old
billet as successor to Suttor, now appointed Pre-
sident of the N.S.W. Upper Tomb. It is to be
hoped that the new Minister’s sword doesn’t get
between his legs.
Sheriff Boothby, who was entrusted with
the division of S.A. into seven districts for the
purpose of elections to the Federal House of
Representatives, has named one of the constituen-
cies after Joe Chamberlain. It would be much
more to the purpose to call it Kingston, more
particularly as it includes the Assembly electorate
for years represented by the father of the Minister
for Customs. How invidious it would be to have
a member for Chamberlain in the Federal Parlia-
ment when Imperial subjects were being discussed!
The indecency of allowing broken-down
Duncan Gillies to hang on to the Vic. Speaker-
ship after the whole of his work has been done
for a year by
Chairman of Com-
mittees Beazley,
is said to be
merely breaking
the ground for
a worse scandal
to come. The
possibility is
being discussed
among poli-
ticians' __ of an
effort by the Ice-
berg crowd to
thrust Bully Bent
into the Legisla-
ti v e Assembly
chair as soon as
Parliament meets
and the inevit-
able questions are
asked with re-
gard to Gillies.
Bent is fatuous
enough to consi-
der that he has
outlived the sins
which cost him
the Speakeiship
when he held it
previously, and
on the other hand,
the smooth Ir-
vine and Shiels
ar) probably only to o anxious
to get rid of their deafen-
ing colleague now that the
dirty work of giving Labor
a “set back” has been ac-
complished.
Carruthers gets both
feet into Parkes s shoes on
the N.S.W. liquor question.
He opposes money compen-
sation, but will give time.
But if, as Joseph and
his holy friends allege,
drink is daily send-
ing souls to hell,
time compensation is
a hideously cold-
blooded solution of the difficulty. Parkes escaped
the effect of this retort by saying “There is no
hell. ” But J oseph is a true believer.
New Yictorian Railway Commissioner
Tait left a railway strike behind him in Canada.
Many Canadian Pacific men had, when the mail
left, been out five weeks fighting for the right to
continue their union membership. At Vancouver
the co. put on 42 Japs, to handle freight, but
they also came out, which is the most encouraging
thing The Bulletin has heard about Japan up to
date.
Pretty nearly all the drunken and in-
capable railway men weeded out of the Vic-
torian service during the last dozen years have
now got back into it under the plea of “loyalty”
during the strike. The question that the public
will shortly have to decide is whether it is better
for them to be killed by a man whose humility has
satisfied Bent, or taken safely to their destination
by a man who has hurt Bent’s feelings.
Bruce Smith, pointing the trembling
finger of scorn at Minister Kingston :
What had the Minister done ? Had he proved one case
of fraud against a member of the mercantile community ?
Where has Rip Van Smith been slumbering?
Apparently he never even heard of his dear
friends, the convicted and bowled-out firm of
Robert Reid and Co.
Verbatim extract from Age report of
unemployed deputation to Bent :
Mr. Fleming : The Premier had promised shelter for
the unemployed, hut had not given it.
Mr. Bent : That’s where you are wrong. The Premier
never bleaks his word. I gave the promise.
Bent apparently regarded that as quite sufficient
explanation of the breakage.
“ Aunt Jane ” Walker (N.S.W.), as he is
known in the Senate, to differentiate him from
“ Mary Jane ” Gould, got off a remark about the
Six Hatters “becoming as historic as the Three
Tailors of Tooley-street. ’ He thought he’d made
a good hit, until Higgs (Q.) replied : “Yes ; and
just about as important.” Then “Auntie ” nearly
wept.
Irvine’s anti-strike session of Parliament
isn’t a record. Victoria’s fifth Parliament held
five sessions in 21 months—they lasted respectively
52 days, 51 days, eight months, 51 days, and 51
minutes. The last was a special session called to
officially scratch the back of the Duke of Edin-
burgh. The tenth Parliament had only one
session, lasting 46 days.
“ Joey ” Carruthers’ policy begins to take
shape in a sort of way; it may now be fairly
described as a square three-sided circle with a
tendency to be a shapeless cube —something like a
public jim-jam, in fact. His latest is :
(1) He wants “the piling up of the debt burden”
stopped, though he doesn’t exactly promise to stop it.
(2) He believes in reducing taxation.
(3) He believes in lots of public works.
(4) He believes in getting a quart out of a pint pot, and
still leaving plenty in the pot.
Dunwich and other Q. charitable institu-
tions have now passed to the jurisdic.tion of John
Leahy, “the strong man” of Philp’s Ministry.
“ Janny ” has promptly decided that a lot of the
Govt, charity is misplaced, so a lot of worn-out
creatures who haven’t got a vote will have either
to starve or resume the hunt for toil, which is the
same thing, till the day of reckoning comes. John
of the Baokblox is now known as the “ Bowels of
Compassion.”
“A.H.”: Re clergymen and the strike.
It is very difficult to tell how many Melbourne
clergymen spoke out for liberty and conciliation,
for their sermons were ignored or “edited.”
Among my small circle were several, notably
the Anglican Bishop Clarke, whose outspoken
utterance could not be twisted to any encour-
agement of the Government tyranny. Also R. H.
Lambley, the Unitarian, a English - trained
Liberal of pro-Boer sympathies.
AN AUSTRALIAN COMMERCIAL

There will be a great collision of wood
when “ Colonel ” Onslow, of Camden Park, fights
John Kidd for the Camden seat at next N.S.W.
election. Onslow is a grandson of John Macarthur,
a very grasping public mendicant who had all the
best land in the district given him 100 years ago,
and reckons, in the good old English squirearchal
way, that he has a lien on the suffrages of his
tenantry. His father had the same idea, and
used the Camden seat now and then when he was
tired of standing up.
Sydney Telegraph now describes the
Government's demand that it shall obey the law,
which provides that newspaper parcels shall pay
one-fourth the ordinary railway parcels rate in-
stead of paying nothing at all, as “taxing news-
papers and suppressing free speech.” Regarded
as an insolent and bounding cadger demanding
victuals at the back door with threats of violence,
the Telegraph now about holds the world’s
record.
The announcement that N.S.W. Labor
party intends to strike in real earnest for a
graduated land-tax and
absentee-tax is good so
far as it goes, but, as
usual, it doesn’t go far
enough. The Labor party
thus proposes to raise a
little extra revenue, but
that can easily be fooled
away and the deficit and
the borrowing leprosy be
left just where they are.
Within the last three
years the annual revenue
lias been increased by over
£1,000,000, and the deficit
has grown worse. N.S.W.
wants a party that is solid
on raising enough revenue
to cover all expenditure
and stop the accumula-
tion of debts and deficits —
either putting revenue up
to expenditure or bringing
expenditure down to re-
venue. And there isn’t a
word about raising enough
revenue so far in the
Labor programme.
The Commonwealth’s appoint-
menss to offices in New Guinea recall
the mess the British Government
made over the first appointment-to
that territory. Premier MTlwraith’s
sensational seizure of the island by a
police-magistrate was annulled, and
Dowmng-street sent out Peter Scratchley as Com-
missioner. At Albany, Scratchley learned that
Germany had grabbed a part of his domain.
However, he toiled on. But Sam Griffith insisted
on seeing the draft of the commission, and, after
study, pronounced the dooument illegal. Owing
to Germany’s grab the boundaries were erroneous,
and Sam, then a Q.C., declared that Seratchley’s
laws and regulations under that commission would
be null and void. Scratchley closed the trouble
by dying.
Much has been made over Curley’s
hours’ speech before N. S. W. Arbitration Court.
A layman is certainly liable to be prolix, but if
paid at all he is generally paid by the job. The
lawyer, on the other hand, is paid generally by
the day, and a matter of 9£ hours is often spun over
a fortnight. Let anyone who wants to see how
many words can be spread around an incident
when the lawyer is paid by the day, turn up
Bruce Smith’s address on the M‘Sharry case.
Some more of Bully Bent’s economies
turned up near Castlemaine (Vic.) a few days
back. An early morning train was stuck up for
an hour as it couldn’t get “ line clear ” from the
next station —the station-master-cum-porter-cura-
everything had been up attending to goods traffic
most of the night, and over-slept himself. Bent’s
plan of relying upon one man to work day and
night upset the running arrangements of three
trains and stranded at least one train-load for a
whole morning.
Two motions in favor of Federal Old Age
Pensions, by Rep. O’Malley and Senator Jaw-
bone Neild, are before the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment. There is no earthly reason why there
shouldn’t be Federal Old Age Pensions. A
Federal graduated land tax and absentee tax,
if as heavy as they should be, would supply
the means, and, incidentally, the former would
also supply much room for the expansion of the
farming industry by shifting that dreadful
obstruction, the big landlord.
Of labor unions which do no business out-
side N.S.W., the Newcastle Miners’ is now much
the strongest in numbers; it has 6006 members,
or had that many in April. The Railway and
Tramway men come next, with 2507 ; but this
doesn’t include firemen and cleaners and others,
who have their separate unions. The Sydney
Wharf Laborers are also over 2000 strong.
According to the return furnished to the Regis-
trar for Arbitration, the bogus Machine Shearers’
and Shed Hands’ Union has 1810 members, while
the A.W.U. is 21,000 strong, inclusive of the Vic.
and S.A. members.
The Commission that is inquiring into
the habits and customs of Melbourne University
stumbled, t’other day, on what old Jock MTntyre
called a “ frightful case of sweating.” It learnt
that the assistants in the State Agricultural
Laboratory, many of them men with a University
education, and men who had proved themselves
competent analysts, only received, as a rule, .£5O
to .£75 a year ! Out of the 27 on the staff, but
two or three get more than £lOO a year. One man
has been doing analytical work on the regular
staff for four ySars, yet only gets £75 ! Seems as
if the Factories Act wants applying to Chief
Secretary Murray’s department just as much as
to the most conscienceless slop-shop in the city.
Johnny Haynes on the abolition of free
newspaper trains :
As to retaliation against the Sydney press for adverse
criticism, it was unworthy of even a third-rate politician
to hamper the despatch of newspapers. It is an outrage
to tax the only means by which country people could
hope to come near to, or compete with, people more for-
tunately situated in the metropolis.
Apparently there isn’t one man in the whole gang
who is honest enough to tell the square truth —
that the Commonwealth Constitution forbids any
State to protect or assist by bounties its goods
against those of other States, and that in abolish-
ing the huge annual grant hitherto made to the
Sydney papers the See Government is only obey-
ing the law.
In the House of Repa. Langdon Bony-
thon’s defence of Kingston’s Customs administra-
tion drew this crushing interjection from |M‘Mil.
lan : “Most of the cases have been for amounts
of £2 and under.” Of course they have, and
some of the biggest embezzlers—men who looted
many thousands—have also been tried for a small
specific steal of £2. When M'Millan’s friend has
done a few hundred £2 swindles be is generally
tried for the one that is most easy of proof. If
he were tried for the whole lot the cases would
take five years.

HOST'S SON: “ Hear ov her! Why, she ran
third in the Jimmicumben Handicap. Her
jock was sent up fer six months, and old
Macfie, that owns her, was fined a tenner.
Hear ov her! I should rather think we did."
George Reid’s assurance that, if we reduce
our 25 per cent, duties to 12£ per cent., there will
be so much more merchandise imported (and con-
sequently so much more to be paid for it, and so
much less local manufacture and local employ-
ment) and that the Treasury will get more revenue
than it does now, suggests that there is going to
be a Reid Blot as well as a Braddou Blot. The
Braddon Blot idea is that, if the Australian Trea-
surer wants £lOO,OOO more customs revenue for
his own use he must raise £400,000, for three-
fourths of all money received from this source has
to go to the States. The Reid Blot idea is that,
if Australia wants another million of customs
revenue, it must buy £8,000,000 of M'Millan’s
foreign goods to get it—and kill £8,000,000
worth of its own manufactures.
New Victorian Railway Commissioner
Tait, leaving Sydney by rail, reached the border
in style (not to mention up to time). When he left
the N.S.W. system and boarded Bent’s humorous
Sydney “Express,” the Vic. men did their best,
and arrived at Seymour only five minutes late.
Exultant at this performance, the men then pre-
pared to reach Melbourne to time, but they hadn’t
gone two miles when Bent’s exhausted engine
sank down on the road disabled, and a tired
Commissioner had to fill in time listening to the
“sarcastic” remarks of the natives of the region,
whilst hasty messages were sent on to Wallan to
send on another engine, so that the new boss
might reach his destination not more than half a
day late.
Henry Campbell Bannerraan speaking for
Freetrade: —
According to Mr. Charles Booth, the eminent statis-
tical authority upon the life and labor of the people of
Great Britain, there were twelve millions of people in
Great Britain under-fed to the verge of hunger. . . . The
Government was engaged in the grand diversion of
making a bonfire of Freetrade, and consigning to the
flames the mistakes of the past; but let it be careful lest
the Empire, now ablaze with prosperity, be not reduced
to ashes.
If to have 12,000,000 people in something like
chronic hunger out of a population of about
40,000,000 is the best “ blaze of prosperity ” Free-
trade can produce, that ghastly fraud had better
leave off blazing at the earliest possible moment.
No wonder other countries avoid Freetrade; they
don’t want one-third of their people to live in
hunger.
Minister Owe’Sullivan, of N.S. W., received
about the worst shock of his life, the other day,
when interviewing a deputation re the proposed
Temora-Barellan railway. He had explained that
the work was hung up because loan-money was
not available, when a deputationist suggested that
the line might be built out of revenue. Then the
Owe’Sullivan fell backwards. When he recovered
he answered, “ No, it’s a reproductive work, and
must be constructed out of loan funds.” And
after all, in this ridiculous remark, the Owe’-
man only represented a very general sentiment.
Australia has borrowed until it has almost come
to be understood that it is a sin to construct any
public work with our own money—to have any
public work that isn’t mortgaged to the last penny
of its value —or to pay off any of our debts. The
great Owe’Sullivan creed is that, when we can’t
get loans, we must cease to build public works
and relapse into barbarism. It is a fool of a
creed, and makes Australia the jeer and laughing-
stock of the world, but this country has got it in
an almost incurable form.

Mr. S. A. PALMER, April 27, 1900.
184 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Dear Sir,—For ten (10) years I have suffered from
Catarrh of the Stomach, suffering intense pain during
the whole time. Several times any life was despaired of,
and at last the doctor said he could do no more for me.
At this time I read vour advertisement, and determined
to give VITADATIO a trial. The result has exceeded
my GREATEST anticipations. I am now FULLY RE-
COVERED, and am in better health than I have been for
the past twelve years. I earnestly recommend the medi-
cine to similar sufferers. You are at liberty to make
what use you like of this, and I shall feel a pleasure in
answering anv questions re my complaint.—Yours truly,
(Signed) ISABELLA CUMMINS.

STEELE RUDD’S
“ On Our Selection.”
From a S.M. Herald leader about King-
ston :
It is a fundamental principle of British justice that a
man charged with wrongdoing shall be deemed innocent
till proved guilty. The Minister (Kingston) reverses the
principle by claiming that every trader is a rogue until
he is proved an honest man.
This silly jibe has been thrown out so often that
it is about time the evidence was produced.
When the importer s clerk is believed to have
faked the boss’s cash-book, the importer generally
has him run-in by a ’tec., and he is put in the
dock, and, if he can’t rebut the evidence brought
against him, he gets 12 months. When the im-
porter is found to have faked his customs entries,
he is summoned in a gentlemanly way, and he
isn’t put in the dock but sits at the solicitors’
table, and, if he can’t rebut the evidence brought
against him, he is fined a trifle. If Kingston
treated the importing swindler as the latter treats
his defaulting clerk, many eminent softgoodsmen
would have been seen making for the lock-up in
charge of a big detective.
DANGEROUS.
The greatest danger from colds and influenza
is their tendency to result in pneumonia. If
reasonable care is used, and Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy taken, all danger will be avoided. It
will cure a cold or an attack of influenza in less
time than other treatment. It always cures, and
cures quickly. Is. 6d.*
Memory and Success.
The Secret of Success—A Cood Memory.
The Pelman System
of Memory Training.

bad memory means worry and failure. No
matter how bad your memory may be Pelman’s
System will make it pood. Even if your memory
is pood, Pelman’s System will teach you how to
use your brains systematically and turn failure
into success.
The System is taught in Five Postal Lessons,
which can be had from Melbourne Branch. All
the teaching required is done successfully by cor-
respondence with Melbourne Secretary. ' The
Melbourne Branch gives you everything you
need, same as Bead Office in London.
Do you want to remember Figures, Dates,

to think rapidly, to reason logically, to avoid
mistakes? In a word, do you want to be in line
with the men whose trained minds have brought
success? Then take Pelman’s Course of Training.
It is simple, easy, practical, effective. If you
have any doubt, however, write first for a FREE

Horsham (Vic.) had a cold, calm thief on its
hands recently. First he leased a block of land outside the
town, and, apparently, didn’t pay the rent. Then he
bought a large quantity of wood on credit, and didn’t pay
for that. Next he stole nearly every buggy in the district
took them to pieces, packed them in cases made out of
unpaid-for wood, and consigned the lot to Adelaide.
But as the procession went towards the station the
unpaid wood-man thought he recognised his timber in
the departing cases, and raised a row with the carrier
about his bill. Then the buggy-lifter lost his nerve, and
fled across country, and the whole thing went to pieces
through one little hitch at the last.

One of the Melb. retail tea-warehouses adver-
tises its brand of dust by devoting one of its city
windows to a representation of a digger seated outside
his tent, and contemplating one of the firm’s packages.
Such a nice* clean digger—spotless moles, irreproachable
shirt, and a beard that has evidently done duty at the
wax-works* Even the heap of mullock at the mouth of
the shaft would bear comparison with India’s coral
strand, and the handles of pick and shovel bear evidence
of being sand-papered daily. The other day a real
bushie happened along, and pushed through the crowd
at the window to investigate. Slowly he spelt out the
inscription till he came to the word digger. Then he
glared, and turning to the crowd roared: “ Digger ! him
a digger! Why, he ain’t no damned digger. He’s a
perfect dashed lydy ! ”

sisted of 28 empty trucks. Sending a man to do a boy’s

“ J.F.D.” : The lady who keeps a fashionable
registry-office for the letting of apartments and finding
cheap and aristocratic “ diggings” seems to me to have
struck a paying reef. My landlady has a back room en-
closing a spring bed, and, being desirous of finding an
occupant, she called at a city office run by a tall military,
looking female, with a General Booth nose, on which a
pince-nez clung like a drowning woman hanging to a rock.
The landlady was immediately mulct of a registration fee
of 2s. 6d., and an inspection visit arranged for the follow-
ing day. The she field-marshal arrived, surveyed the pre-
mises, ordered the hat-stand to be removed to the other
side of the hall, made the cringing landlady turn up the
mattress, collected 2s. inspection fee and 6d. tram-fares,
and departed, sweeping the small housemaid nearly out
of the front door. When the landladj’ recovered her
breath, she told me the bony-nosed cyclone, if she
found a boarder who would stay a month, claimed the
first week’s board money in addition to the ss. already
paid. I appeased Mrs. Todgers by telling her she was-
exceedingly lucky to escape cab-fares or p . !.aps the hire
of a motor car for the inspection trip.

As to “private enterprise,” two Queensland
sugar mill companies working under the Sugar Works
Act actually petitioned the State to manage their affairs
because they had become virtually insolvent. The State
did so on short notice, although there were no officers in>
the Government service who had the necessary training
for this sort of business, and after three years of absolute
State management both concerns have paid their way.
The northern company (Proserpine Central Mill Co.) now
pays interest and redemption to the State for original
capital advanced, which was never done under the old
“ private enterprise ” regime.

“F.C.”: Am seriously thinking of becomings
landlord in a large way. There seem to be pickings.
Friend of mine whose five-years’ lease of a'market garden
was about to expire, was informed by landlord that he
couldn’t be granted a renewal, as he (tenant) had lately
bought a piece of ground which he proposed turning into 1
a garden of his own. Landlord reckoned a, tenant un-
desirable who didn’t, or mightn’t, give his whole time
and attention to his leased land. Tenant inquired of
landlord what latter would allow him for improvements.
“Nothing! The lease stipulates that all fixtures remain
on the property.” So ray friend had to walk out leaving
a new pump, chimney, several chains of barbed wire
fencing, and other improvements, for which the new
tenant pays an increased rental. Also, friends and self
lately helped a widow, who was trying to keep herself
and youngsters by a small shop, by turning-to one night
and fitting up several rows of shelves, window-slides, Ac.
A mohth later she wanted to shift to a cheaper and better
situated shop, and asked us if we would mind moving the
Shelves, &c., for her. We cheerfully agreed; but the
landlord summarily objected, saying fixtures were his
property. He also refused compensation for improve-
ments, and got an increased rent on the strength of them.
p.S.—We have since settled our account with that man—
but that is another story.

“Petramos”: Conversing with Blank, the
landlord of a tied beer-house, he informed me that,
besides other burdens, he had to bear that of advertising
his brewing co.’s wares for nix. It is done like this .
The co. brings along some hideous board, and, without
permission, puts it up on the landlord s balcony. The
landlord takes it down. The co. (again without permis-
sion) puts it up agfain. The landlord wants it to be paid
for. This is refused, and the landlord hauls it down
a»-ain, saving he is not going to have his balcony dis-
figured for nothing. Then the brewing co. writes the
landlord saying that if he doesn’t choose to have the
advt. up he needn’t, but respectfully reminds him that it
can be nasty if it likes. And poor Boniface, recollecting
what the co. could do if it wanted to, submits to the
lvrannv, and sticks beery advts. (no good for his trade)'
all round his balcony, and turns away others who are
W iUi nK to pay for such advertisements, and loses boarders
Who would sooner stay at a hotel from the balcony of
Which they could see something of the street.
“C. 0.”: What a very profitable swindle the
registry office swindle is 1 The employer is charged, say f
10s. commission, and the employee anything from £1 to
£5, for the billets are sold by the agents to the highest
bidders, irrespective of fitness. The agent relies solely
upon his, or her, miraculous gift of observation. Let an
applicant enter the office and offer £5 for a billet for “ me
and the missus,” and the agent, with one swift glance (at
the fiver), knows that “ this splendid couple would be a
dazzling acquisition to any station—hardworking, honest,
truthful, clean, economical, good-tempered, very abject
to their employer, and—married.” The fiver tells him all
that at a glance. Knew a case recently of a man who
was sent up as a first-class boundary-rider, but when he
was introduced to the horse he was to use, he explained
that, never having been on a horse, he would prefer to
walk around his twenty miles of fence. Told that he
would have to exercise his walking powers in getting
back to Sydney, he nearly wept, and declared he had
given the agent his last pound (she had asked for five) to
obtain the billet. The boss, being a humane man, paid
the boundary-walker’s fare back, which, added to his
fare up and £1 to the agent, made his agency experiment
rather expensive. But isn’t it a case of centralisation
run mad when even station hands go to Sydney to get
billets in the bush ?
* • • *
“C.A.R.O.’’: Wayback business ideas ate
sometimes rather crude. A station employee, with six
months’ earnings in his pockets, visited Wyalong diggings
once. He struck two impecunious acquaintances pro-
specting an alleged reefing show. Fired by sanguine
expectations, the bushman agreed to buy in, and after
several drinks handed over the sum agreed upon. During
his solitary ride home he sobered up and felt misgivings
at having parted with his hard cash without written
acknowledgment. Something must be done to avert a
calamity should his claim be repudiated. Accordingly
that night he compiled a document thus: “I, Dan
Smith, certfy I bort in with Sid Jones and Fred Morgan
of there clame & pade 7 pond the shere, sined Dan
Smith.” Smith then went to his employer and had the
valuable document put in the safe. The show is a dead-
and-gone frost, but the receipt is still extant.

“Eiddal”: The mortgagee deserves a kinder
word than he generally receives. Have never seen a line
written in praise of the large army of implement makers,
agents, storekeepers, etc., in their relations with the
drought-stricken “cookies.” Yet not one that I have
heard of has moved a hand to push the unfortunates in
this large district (near the Murray), and the conspiracy
of wait-for-a-good-season-for-our-money is deserving a
word of commendation. One small storekeeper did
threaten to summon a cocky a few miles out. When a
larger creditor heard of it he went and paid the bill to
silence the talker, for if one piece of blue paper got home,
all the cockies in the neighborhood would find their
creditors after them like a pack of wolves. Even the
banks, and money-lenders generally, are entirely sym-
pathetic-even after waiting over three seasons for
interest—and this state of affairs has much to do with
the seeming solvency of areas that cannot boast a cocky
able to pay for a “bag of flour.” If the coming season
prove “ a bit of orlright,” every cocky will be able to
pretty well clear himself; if we have another dry season,
well —Sheol will be nothing to the state of things that
will exist for a few years to come. May He (whose hand
pulls the string of the big shower-bath) not let the trust
of the trusters mentioned above be in vain 1
“E.”: “Twenty-seven capable hands. No
•waiting,” caught my eye, and I found myself in “the
brightest saloon in the city.” “ Take a seat—you’re
next,” was hurled at me as I entered, and soon it became
my turn to be attacked. “Shave or hair cut?” (I am
nearly bald.) As he lathered he talked the usual barber
talk. “ Razor right, sir ? Your hair’s getting a little
thin on top, sir. You should join our club, sir ;we keep
a dermatologist free to all our weekly subscribers—if
you’d let him see your hair ; no charge, sir. I’m sure
you’d soon be wanting your hair cut once a week. Oh,
he’s a marvel, sir, and just from America ; and only Is. a
week, which includes four shaves a week, hair cut when
required, boots blacked, &c.” “Does it,” I mildly
inquired, “include coals and board?” I consented,
however, to share these blessings with my own mug and
brush for the sum of Is. a week, and got my Is. ready
for the first week’s instalment. At beck of my barber, up
■came the dermatologist man, who looked at my head
through a microscope and reported “fine young
hair starting to grow.” He said that under
his charge, and at the cost of Is. weekly, I
should soon be like the hairy man from Borneo. He
ordered my varlet to put some mixture on my head. The
operation over, I stepped with my blue ticket (which I
fondly imagined designated the shilling aforesaid) to the
counter, the stout lady beaming upon me very graciously.
I had a shilling in my pocket, but fearing she might think
it my only coin, I pulled out 2s. 6d. and awaited the
■change. “ Fourteen and six, please," said the stout lady.
“Fourteen and six !” I shouted. “Whaffor?” “One
shilling for the weekly subscription, 2s. for entrance fee,
and 11 s. 6d. for a bottle of our wonderful hair restorer.”
Imagine my feelings, 14s. 6d.—the price of a race horse
these hard times. I paid rather than argue, but I am
going to slay the wonderful dermatologist fresh from
America—slay him deader than any other was ever seen
before.”

N.S.W. Commercial Agents seem largely em-
ployed in telling Australian exporters things that they
ought to know already. For instance, orchardists have
been sending apples to France. “There is no room for
them,” writes Commercial Agent Lance. It would be
astounding if there were. France is an apple country.
But it is as astounding that Australian apple-growers do
not know that.
Sydney Anglicanism differentiates sub-
stantially between the plebeian corpse that takes
to clay and the tony one that demands brick-
work. The legalised tariff for interment runs
thus for burials :
In Clay. In Bricked Vault.
Clergyman .. 5s £llO
Clerk .. .. 2s. .. .. 7 6
Sexton .. .. is 2 0
This is charging not according to station in life,
but station in death, for the parson’s duties are
the same whether clay or brick be the last resting-
place. And many a stingy corpse must curse in-
wardly at being charged £1 Is. for ss. worth of
preacher.
British army reform under Lord Roberts
is proceeding satisfactorily. Within the past
few months the following progressive steps have
been ordered:
Officers of line regiments to wear frock coats with an
opening 9J inches wide at the top.
Officers of line regiments to wear frock coats with an
opening 7£ inches wide at the top (previous regulation
cancelled;.
Gold lace slings for full dress abolished.
Gold lace slings restored.
Mounted officers to wear spat-putties.
Spat-putties abolished.
Trousers to have red-piping sewn down the seam.
Trousers to have a cloth band down the seam (previous
regulation cancelled).
Trousers to have red piping, sewn flat, down the seam
(both previous regulations cancelled).
[Note that, with all this attention to trousers, the
necessity of fitting them with armor-plate seats
has not been considered.]
Twisted cord to be substituted for piping as shoulder
badges.
And many others. Australians who took commis-
sions in the British army find the reform pace a
good deal too hot for them, and have to retire ere
bankrupting themselves in clothes. It takes a
great deal of money to keep up with Lord Roberts’
enthusiasm for reform.
“ Kati-Kati : I am getting sick of washing.
It’s not the game it’s cracked up to be. Fifty
years ago, in an English village, one could be
most fastidiously clean by washing face and hands
twice a day and bathing twice a year. Now two
baths a day and a dozen washings of hands and
face give one no proud pre-eminence. One dreads
the fumigations and disinfectings and antiseptic
washings that will shortly be considered the irre-
ducible minimum of cleanliness, and yet leave one
feeling no cleaner. There seems no finality about
washing, and, after ail, a man is only as clean as
he feels, and a woman as clean as she looks.
Three men rolled out of a city club
t’other night, and staggered along the street.
One of the trio, who was a superintendent of a fire
brigades, commenced to tell his friends wonderful
tales of his brigade’s efficiency. His friends,
making no comment, sat down on a doorstep.
“Wh’V” hiccuped the sup., trying to keep his
balance standing up, “ you doan (hie) bdieve me.
I tell you my brigade can travel at 40. mile an
hour—4o mile an hour, I shay ! I’m willing to
bet half-a-dollar I can bring the blanky (hie)
brigade here in a minute.” One of the friends
accepted the bet on condition that they should be
given a ride home. The sup. then made a search
for a fire-alarm, smashed the glass and waited.
One, two, three, five minutes passed, and no
brigade put in an appearance, and, seeing his
friends had fallen asleep, the superintendent set
out for the fire station (|-mile distant) to investi-
gate. He reached the station an hour-and-a-half
later. He had sobered somewhat on the way,
and wanted to know why the devil the street
call wasn’t answered. On being told that no call
had been received, the hatless official scratched
his head, and sent a man round to investigate.
Later, the man reported that the —— street
alarm had not been touched, but a dentist’s show-
case close by had been smashed. Also, he’d found
Messrs. and and the sup.’s hat on a
doorstep, and had taken them all home. The
superintendent gave him half-a-sovereign to say
nothing about the matter, and it is presumably
owing to the dead silence he maintained that the
story is here set down.
THE OLD CASHIERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Where are the snows of Autumn ? *
The poet Villon cried.
In vain, in vain he sought ’em
On moorland and hillside.
But I, far more forlorn than he,
Cry out, across the years :
Where are the men who stood by me—
Where are the Old Cashiers ?
Many a time I tasked them
For half a quid or crown,
But, ev’ry time I asked them,
They planked the money down.
They did not make a fool of me ;
And so I ask with tears :
Where are the men who used to be—
Where are the Old Cashiers ?
Says one—“ What are you wishing ?"
With pleasant silver guile.
“ I’m going to go a-flshing,”
I’d answer with a smile.
“You’re just like what I used to be ;
Your lie my old age cheers ”
And he’d give seven-and-six to me—
Where are the Old Cashiers ?
Fine old cashiers, a-inany
In bygone days I knew ;
But now there’s hardly any
Who’ll cash my 1.0. U.
In vain, in vain I’ve sought ’em.
And so I ask with tears :
Where are the snows of Autumn ?
Where are the Old Cashiers ?

JAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Agricultural Minister Kidd recently told a number of
Parramatta fruitgrowers, who proposed to start a jam
factory that “ it would be desirable that even for jam-
making good fruit should be available.” Just so.
In making of black-currant
Jam, or raspberry, or plum,
The maker should be careful,
And not work by rule of thumb.
The vegetable marrows
That he uses should be sound ;
The melons and the pumpkins
Should be good as grow on grou id.
And all the fruit he boils down
It should stand the strictest test;
And, if he uses turnips,
Swedish turnips are the best.
He shouldn’t use bananas
That have rotted into glue,
For that would be dishonest—
And would spoil his market, too.
’Tis this adulteration
By makers without shame,
That with the Honest Public
Gives the trade an evil name.
And, when the jam is ready,
He should put it up in tins,
That little folk may eat it—
For their prospective sins.

warn people to always make sure that they have
been given Scrubb’s Ammonia, and not an

Prosperous Canterbury Jockey Club (M.L.) is
setting up another grand stand, to cost £12,000. One
feature will be 24 private boxes, priced at £lOO each, and
all have been snapped up. The annual meeting pro-
nounced against so much as £4OOO being given during the
season for two-year-old races, and expressed the opinion
that the number of short distance events should be cur-
tailed and longer distance contests substituted. Members
wouldn’t cotton on to the stipendiary steward system, in
view of the fact that it hadn’t proved a howling success
in Sydney. A mistake. Because Sydney stipendiaries
don’t do their duty it doesn’t follow that M.L. officials
would be guilty of similar laches.

V.R.C. Birthday meet at Flemington, Monday,
had adverse weather and tracks were holding and watery.
Though attendance was larger than expected, the club
will lose over the venture. Three of seven starters in
Steeple came down. Feature of the programme was the
fine form of lightweight jock Carslake, who, with three
mounts, won three events. Twelve turned out for Birth-
day Handicap, but the field didn’t include a single high-
class nag. Sultan of Johore’s recent purchase—Rapid
Pilgrim—opened first favorite, but wh°n betting settled
down Moonee Valley winner Muntchaka supplanted him.
At the half distance Rapid Pilgrim was in front; then
Gold Bar quickly deposed him, to be, in turn, squelched
by Florin (in the last stride or two), who scored by half a
head amid intense excitement. Rapid Pilgrim was a
head away, third. Florin belongs to South Australian
sport, Mr. W. J. Rowen, and ran practically unbacked.
Favorite was in trouble all the time.

Adelaide R.C. Birthday meet closed Saturday.
Rain in the morning rendered conditions under foot
very sloppy. Principal event, the Alderman Cup, fell to
Adjuster, from 12 others, after a close finish with Tinfoil
(a neck away) second, and The Bird (a head further off)
third. Most of the starters were well backed. Cross
Keys was first choice, with the winner next in demand.
Spite of uninviting weather, tote business totalled
£13,847—0n1y £689 less than same day last year. Machine
takings for the three days were £43,429—a shortage of
£5674.

Orphan Boy (by Navigator from Golden Image),
winner of Adelaide Birthday Cup, Saturday, did most of
his racing in N.S.W., annexing, among other events,
Rbsehill and May Handicaps and Newcastle Tatt.’s Cup.
Present owner (Mr. J. Nicholas) bought him from Mr. I>.
Hutchinson 12 months ago, and brought the nag to
Westralia, where he gathered Kalgoorlie Tramway Handi-
cap and Coolgardie Cup last August, and Geraldton Cup
following October. Top-notch nags of Australian turf
history have figured among Adelaide Cup winners at
different times—notably Locksley, Richmond, Darebin,
Mata of earlier days, and latterly, Sardine, La Tosca,
Destiny, Paul Pry, Footbolt, and last Melbourne Cup
winner Victory.

In a field of 15 Noble Lady was sent out red-hot
(at 2 to 1) for A.J.C. Exeter Stakes, Monday, and
won handily. Public generally (despite the free flow of
money for the mare) never anticipated the happening, in
view of the fact that she was unplaced at Tatts.’ meeting,
May 16 ; was third in Moorefield Flying Handicap, seven
days later, and never threatened trouble once in A.J.C.
Princess May Stakes, nine days before her success. Stable
connections and a few of the cute crowd gathered the bulk
of the boodle. Noble Lady was owned by recently-
deceased Frank Kuhn, and his brother had the mount on
Saturday.

Four stripped for A.J.C. ’Chase, Monday.
Billy Barton and Monarch were in front till after crossing
“ the treble ” first time, when 8.8. hit hard and came a
cropper. Subsequently, however, and after some trouble
in securing the nag, rider remounted and finished the
round. Monarch streaked away from t’other two for 21m.;
but the hill-top fence brought disaster. Jockey G. Hunter
and nag lay apparently lifeless for some time, and, just
as everyone feared the worst, the horse stood up and then
so did his jock, who, getting astride again, finished the
journey, securing third money, amidst hearty plaudits
from all sections of the ground. Ultimate winner
Brokerage owned the race—hard held from first lep to
concluding run ; though racing closely bracketed with
Signet over the greater part of the journey, he scored
very easily at the end.

Most of the 14 that lined up for A.J.C. Prince
of Wales Stakes (lm. 3fur.), Monday, had “ the sweep.”
Tatterdemalion (talked a week before as “ good goods ”)
was tipped a “ moral ” on the course, and sent out a
warm first favorite at sto 2 against. Fanfare, .Nothos,
Vocalist and Fireclay were also heavily invested upon.
Finish proved a treat—Randwick has never seen anything
better. Passing Leger stand chances of about eight
looked equally rosy. Backers howled deliriously as
Tatterdemalion, Mechlin and Nothos moved to the front
and raced abreast until Mechlin broke up a few strides
from home, leaving the fight to Tatterdemalion and
Nothos, the latter landing the monev by a head.

laide, Melbourne, and Sydney Prince of Wales Birthday
meetings should have produced exceptionally exciting
finishes. In Sydney there was a head between first and
second, and a neck between second and third. Adelaide
saw a neck and a head the respective margins, and Mel-
bourne half-a-head.

Wallace-Moonlyong filly Hes, owned by
“ Havilah” White, appropriated A.J.C. Nursery Handicap
(Monday) easily from favorite Graft, and strong tip,
Master Correze. Hitherto Hes, though always
brilliantly away, invariably failed badly at the end
of five furlongs, but this time she went f-mile, and
finished at least as strong as the others, while hundreds
of onlooking punters kicked themselves for not “stand-
ing” her once more.

“’Oxboro” trained colt St. Modan brilliantly
got away with a double (Farm Stakes and Welter) at
Warwick Farm, Saturday, starting at 4 and 7 to 1 as
named, and putting up 101 b. penalt3’ in latter event,
which brought his load to 9.3. Both races were hotly
fought, successful nag beating 18 in the second success.
St. Modan belongs to a lady whose turf name is “ Mr.
Russell Chiswick ”; he is by Haut Brion from the
Trenton mare Galvina, the dam of Cataract and Milli.
Coining from a fine racing stock, St. Modan will probably
make a big splash shortly.

June Handicap, principal item of Bris-
bane Tatt.’s meet, Saturday, went to Little Tartar (3 to
1) who beat favorite Gozard (5 to 4) by three-quarters of
a length, with third last choice, Splenthorpe, following
half length further off. L.T.’s dam, Nandu, is by Dare-
bin from Narina, by Yattendon ; he finished fourth in
Queensland Cup at Q.T.C. meet last month.

Fourteen mishaps occurred in one day’s racing
at Takapuna (M.L.) recently. Eight of these took place
in the Maiden Hurdles, in which 14 started. The state of
the ground was a minor cause, the non-proficiency of the
jumpers the main fault. Why do owners send out prads
for stick events before giving them a good schooling ?
Wonder is that jocks can be found who will risk their
necks to ride ’em.

Caliban, one-time champion jumper and hunter
of the Echuca (Vic.) district, went the way of all horse-
flesh t’other day, from old age. Twenty-two years ago
Caliban made his debut at Elmore show, and thenceforth
carried all before him for years, winning for his owner
(Billy Enders, of Oarag Carag) over £6OO in trophies and
cash. Caliban was always reckoned one of the Enders
family, and Billy’s wife has had a wisp of the old hero’s tail
worked into a watch-guard as a durable memento of an
_animal that never ate any oats he didn’t honestly earn.

Prize money (£2815) given at recent Q T.C.
autumn meet was well distributed. Thirty-four owners

Entries for next year’s A.J.C. classic events
show a shortage of 148 as compared with last year.
December Stakes has 53 as against 87 ; Champagne Stakes

Melbourne Cup nominations closed last week

S.A.J.C. meet provided.
“ Adelaide ” : The British Association game of
football, through requiring the ball to be kicked under
the crossbar, encourages the training of big men as goal-
keepers. Foulke, who “ keeps ” for a front-rank Sheffield
club, and has been chosen in a picked team Of England
more than once, tips the beam at 23st. 101 b. ! The actual
record is held by a circus elephant, which was installed
between the posts at a theatrical fancy-dress match
in Birmingham some years ago, the only corner of the
goal left open to attack being just between his extended
foreleg and his trunk.

In S. A.., where thelocal M.P. gets only £2OO a year,
and pickings are few, 56 of the 60 members some little time
back entered into a solemn league and covenant to refuse
to be bled by the cricket and football clubs of their
respective districts. To the first letter or two, intimating
that Mr. Blank Dash, M.P., had been “unanimously
elected vice-president of the Young Turks II.,” Mr.
Blank Dash sent back an emphatic “No it seemed a
safe thing to do, because the handwriting of the sec.
suggested that the Young Turks 11. didn’t yet have a
vote. Presently, however, the Senior Turks also
notified Blank Dash of his appointment as vice-
president ; and, on reflecting that he got in by only
a small majority last election, and that the Senior Turks
had 25 votes, he resolved to send the usual trifle— if any
of the other 55 covenanters stuck him up about it he
would say that he didn’t send the trifle as an M.P., but
that he supported the Senior Turks on the broad question
of principle and as a private citizen. But none of the
other 55 did stick him up —most of them had been doing
the same thing themselves. Now there is another solemn
league and covenant never to mention the other one ; and
the Young Turks are getting the usual reply that Blank
Dash is grateful for the honor conferred upon him, and
that he begs to enclose half-a-guinea towards the funds
of the club, of whose success, etc.

A fearsome exhibition of Rugby was given in
Invercargill (M.L.) district when a town crowd of juniors
went countrywards to flatten out a bucolic team. Rules
were cast to the winds, and when temper got the better
of the wranglers little heed was paid to the oval at all ;
it was a case of kick whenever there was a moving
obstacle, whether he was standing, or lying on the ground.
When things were sorted out after the battle ’twas found
that about 15 were injured, the sides suffering almost
equally. One man had a limb broken, another had to
have his face stitched up, and the others were so badly
mauled that they couldn’t show out for over a week. It
was a great game 1

The assets of the Melbourne Bicycle Club {vide
the annual balance-sheet) now total £lo,s4l—the last
Austral Wheel Race, though a falling-off on previous
years, scooping in £694 14s. lid. What a difference
between the Melbourne Club and the N.S.W. League of
Wheelmen ! The latter body hasn’t an asset worth
noting; and as for management—well, the less said about
that the better.
* * * *
Australian Federal Cycling Council’s decision
to form a body on the co-operative principle for the pur-
pose of bringing out fore-front European and American
bikists isn’t relished a bit by N.S.W- speculators, who
have hitherto had a monopoly. And the monopoly, on
the whole, has panned out handsomely, and they are
kicking vigorously, and assert that already arrangements
for inducing the presence here of Danish, French,
American, and Indian riders are progressing. All the
same, it looks as if the council’s project—capital, £2OOO
(200 shares at £lO each)—will become an accomplished
fact, especially as the shares are to be equally divided
among leagues (six) represented on the council.
N.S.W. bike league matters wax interesting,
and amusing too. Want of confidence motion, passed by
68 members at a special meeting, has been ignored by the
offending council, which obstinately declines to resign as
desired. Meanwhile, deposed sec. Branagan has been
re-instated, and, chuckling over the discomfiture of the
enemy, is going on with his duties as usual. He contends
that the general meeting having condemned the council,
that body doesn’t now legally exist, and that another
council must be created to carry on the League’s work.
But the objectionable body isn’t going to be bundled out
without a vigorous kick. It purposes appealing to
members generally Wednesday, next week, with the object
of discussing expulsion of Mr. Branagan and its action
anent the Dunlop road race. Meanwhile, the dismissed
sec,, who won’t be dismissed, has written the Dunlop Tyre
Co., sanctioning its road race “unconditionally,” and
assuring it of the League’s hearty support. Develop-
ments are being eagerlv watched.

Return ’rastle ’tween turbaned heathens Buttan
Singh and Gunga Brahm, in Melbourne, last week, saw
former easily turn the tables. This time, Buttan had
got himself into excellent fix. At last moment
Gunga, though in the hall, refused to shape till threatened
with loss of his whack of the “ gate ” as well as £5 lodged
as a guarantee that he would show, First bout, the
heathen raged considerably, writhing and twisting for
7Jmin_, till Buttan got the “ grape-vine ” on and secured
the fall. Gunga was inclined to “chuck it” then, but
the enemy’s taunts and jeers goaded him to having
another “cut.” This time, they displayed absolute
ferocity till a half Nelson brought Gunga over on his
back in 2min. 29sec. Buttan thus won with two straight
falls, and then, with a yell and a wild Allah-a-hoo, chal-
lenged any man on the continent for £2OO a-side. Pity
that there isn’t a white man visible in the land with a
hope of wiping the Indian out—and he is no wonder at
that.

Ex-English champion billiardist Stevenson,
playing his first Australian game against Scott, the Perth
champion, gave 550 in 1000, but was nowhere at the
finish. In fact, Scott got Jahead of his handicap at one
stage—9l3 to 311 —but the Englishman then put on 253
while the local man was adding 87. The cloth wasn’t
spread tightly enough to suit Stevenson’s delicate “ side”
play.
* * * *
Rumball and Belfield—ex-and present champion
amateur billiardists—kicked against N.S.W. Sports Club’s
definition of an amateur. Rumball contended that the
fact of an amateur forfeiting his status through engaging
in a tournament which included professionals, placed
upon the amateur the responsibility of sifting out ante-
cedents of all competitors in such events. So the com-
mittee obligingly inserted “ knowingly,” and Rumball
retired satisfied. Belfield wasn’t in accord with Rum-
ball’s views at all, but had a growl of his own ; there
should, he said, be no objection to an amateur playing
an exhibition match “ with distinguished professional
visitors.” But the committee reckons that an “amateur
doesn’t play with the ‘ distinguished professional ’ two or
three hours every night for a week for nothing but the
honor and glory.”

Governing body of Maoriland amateur athletics
has been sounding the vario'us associations regarding
guarantees in the event of a visit of a Hinglish or ’Mur-
kan team this December. Six men were to be imported
to compete at 22 meetings, extending over ten weeks ;
cost (approximately) £lOOO. Associations can’t see the
way clear to find the coin this year, so the scheme has
been dropped, but the executive intends working it up for
next season.

Two courses before final, the owners
of Army Girl, ultimate winner of recent Bel-
more (Sydney) Federal Coursing Cup (for which 48 dogs
were slipped), wanted to withdraw her on the ground
that sue was too much the worse for wear and tear to go
on. But the stewards wouldn’t allow it, and the hound
shaped more brilliantly subsequently than before.
Feature of the competition was the downfall of well
backed Victorian Planet through the agency of unthought
of Croix. Backers laid 20 to 1 on former, and Mo.
offered 10 to 1 against latter. Planet’s price straight out
for the stake was 5 to 1; he divided favoritism with
Army Girl and Lumpkin.

“Jab” : Saw it stated that Maoriland amateur
champion Fitzsimmons (brother of the only Bob) would
come over and compete in continent’s amateur premier-
ships to be decided in Sydney September next. This is
very unlikely in the face of fact that an injury to his eye,
sustained while working in his smithy, recently laid him
up 18 weeks. Most likely he will never compete as a
boxer again—the eye is sure to go against him.
Match in Adelaide, Saturday night last, for
lightweight championship of S.A. between “Cocker”
Tweedie and Jim Iliscutt was for £5O a-side, and drew a
crowded house. Bets at ring-side were big, even money
being freely offered and taken. Hiscutt was atop from
the start, serving out punishment liberally. In the
second round Tweedie was floored five times, and on the
last occasion he failed to respond. Tweedie has gone off
materially ; his fighting of two or three years since would
have had Hiscutt guessing all the time. A little while
back same two met in Sydney, and then Tweedie led till
police interference stopped proceedings, and Hiscutt got
the verdict—an unjustifiable decision.
Black dandy pug. Peter Felix went to Bendigo
races bv same train as Sultan of Johore, and several of
the “ naicest ” were on the platform to meet the Malay
potentate. Felix, arrayed faultlessly (dazzlingly, in fact),
was among the first out of the cars. “ There he is ! ”
“ There he is ! ” whispered the crowd one to anot her, and
they cheered him, whereupon Peter (not a bit taken aback)
doffed his high silk hat again and again—bowing low
the while—evidently under the impression that it was all
in recognition of his cleverness in keeping as far away
from Bill Doherty, in their contest the other day, as the
24ft, ring would allow. Meanwhile the Sultan, who
isn’t nearly as black and gorgeous-looking as Felix, got
away unnoticed.

Monty Andrews-Paddy Martin scrap, at Sydney
National, last week, was willing and determined enough,
but lacked incident throughout, and became depressingly
monotonous often because of the sameness of the fight-
ing. Close of stipulated 20 rounds witnessed both on
their feet, and referee M‘Donaid gave the fight to
Andrews—a good decision, which the great bulk of the
house cheered.
* * * *
Jim Higgins, the Port Melb. rising star, main-
tained his reputation for giving the public good value for
their money when he defeated veteran Starlight, at Melb.
Queen’s Hall, on Saturday night, Starlight certainly
gave no indication of the 52 years he is reputed to carry,
as he stepped into the ring as shinv and hard as a
polished cocoanut, And when the fight started, he
proved that age cannot wither nor custom stale the in-
finite variety of his blows nor the power behind them.
Starlight fought better than Australia has seen him do since
the old days when he made a splendid showing against the
best, but he w'as up against a man half his age and one
upon whom the worst punishment dropped like the
gentle dew from heaven. Nevertheless, Starlight had
Higgins on two occasions so dazzled from his mass of
whirling uppercuts that he was glad to clinch the rounds
out. Hitting in clinches was frequent at one stage and a
warning from the referee, Stokesby, led to a conversation
on unauthorised stoush between him and Tot Higgins, who
was seconding his brother. In fact, conversations ’were
the only thing that marred the fight. Starlight, during
the thickest part of the battle, talked more than a free-
trade senator on the Address-in-Reply and the audience
joined in. Eventually he got a hit over the heart and
another on the upper arm which led to his squirming in
pain and giving best. The nig. thought that what ailed
him was an injured ligament. As a matter of fact he was
suffering from clergyman’s sore throat,
* * * *
Jim Higgins promises to be the best middle-
weight the Southern State has produced for many
a day. The younger brother of Tot Higgins, he
has for instructor a man who had few superiors
in Australia as far as science was concerned. That
he has benefited by such instruction is shown by
his own cleverness. Added to this, he is an unusually
hard hitter and possesses a unique capacity for taking
punishment. In the first five rounds of his last fight with
Fraser, Higgins got enough to satisfy three men, yet
every hit merely inspired him to further effort. There
was no sparring for wind after a blow, no clinching to
avoid further trouble. The more Higgins got, the better
he enjoyed it, and the harder his own hits grew. There
should be a future for this sort of man in the rim'—or out
of it for that matter.

Pug situation, as far as the forefronters of heavy-
weight brigade are concerned, is interesting. Doherty
after beating Felix, has challenged all comers for any
stake, despite that he previously went under to Dan
Oreedon and champion Billy McCall ; and a Kalgoorlie
(\\ .A.) speculator has offered Doherty and McCall a £4OO
purse. Tasmanian fighter James wanted to connect with
Doherty or McCall, but former refused to visit Tasmania
under any consideration, though willing to fight in Mel-
bourne. Meanwhile, McCall and James were negotiating
Queenstown (Tas.) sports offered £lOO purse, and James
promised to bet £2OO on the side. Sydney National S O
went £5O higher, with the addition of £2O expenses to
James. Then Tasmanian people increased their induce-
ment to £2OO, which will probably fetch McCall, but he
hadn t quite made up his mind when The Bulletin went
to press. Dan Creedon chipped in late, asking how it
was lus challenge for £5OO a-side had been ignored ; but
as McCall can t fight the lot at one time, some must
wait, and, provided the champion is a winner always,
he 11 give every man of the three a turn, for not one
among them loves fighting better.

“ J.F.D.” : The man who is found in possession
of a spring stump, or a spring punching-ball for testing
one’s strength by sledge-hammer or fist, should be prose-
cuted by law. Know a puny clerk, possessor of a five and
a half inch bicep, who thought himself a Samson. He
grabbed a 281 b. sledge one night at Paddy’s Markets
Sydney, and struck a mighty blow at a battered stump
which rested on a spring that would hold the national
debt. He now wears a truss—a victim of acute hernia
Know another, a powerful man, who struck with the
force of a Cootamundra cyclone when the machine hap-
pened to be taking a rest, with the result that both his
wrists were broken. The owner of the.machine only
charged the usual fee of threepence. The -same with the
spring punchitig-machine. Every consumptive clerk
thinks he can strike a blow like Bob Fitzsimmons, and
generally succeeds in spraining his wrist, or injuring
some muscle of the arm. Besides, the machine is no
actual test of strength ; the muscular man seldom puts
up the record punch.

Persistently rumored that big Shoalhaven
sculler, Jim Stanbury, now engaged in dredge work at
Newcastle, proposes having another cut at world’s cham-
pionship honors and will challenge winner of Tressider-
Towns match—if it takes place. He recently got his old
racing shell up from Sydney for purposes of practice, and
is said to have backers who’ll find the needful for him
when he is ready. Late last year Jim went into the
thing in earnest and brought his bulk from 17st. to I4st
but supporters were lacking and he drifted back to the
previous state again. Boat now being used hy Stanburv
is that wherein he defeated English champion, Harding,
and was beaten by then world’s premier (Gaudaur)on
the Thames.

Last Saturday’s win of inter-’Varsity “eight”
race was Sydney’s ninth in 16—one of which (’B9) saw
N.S.W. crew absent. Sydney has never been beaten at
home. Melbourne won five times and Adelaide twice.
Victoria succeeded last year and six of that crew' were in
the boat on Saturday. Total weigh l sof crews concerned
were- Sydney, 90st. 71bs. ; Melbourne, 9ist. 7!hs., and
Adelaide, 90st. 31bs. Couldn’t be picked much closer.
Seated in their boats. Melbourne’s combination certainly
looked heavier than the difference given.
Alderman Ross, of Waterloo, recently informed
the local council that “the scum of the earth collected
outside certain racecourses on certain days of the week,
and he had been compelled to get out of his trap and lead
the horse through the crowd.” L ’
Recent photographs of phenomenon “Terrible”
Terry MVovern prove the sporting aphorism that they’re
good in all shapes. Not that the deposed featherweight
champion is poorly built, hut he stands with his left toe
sharply turned in, violating one of the most important < f
pugilistic conventions. And this is more than a con-
vention, for any man standing in such a position leaves
his body so balanced that the slightest tap in one direction
will overset it. This shows that Terry is : a great fighter
in spite of his faults, and yet we will probably see a score
of his admirers imitating what they would do better to
avoid.
“ Ike” : There is no doubt about our being a
sporting community. VVas watching an aged fanatic in
Richmond (Vic.) wardens giving opt tracts, the other
Sunday morning. There were fout\people walking in
front of me, at intervals of about 20yds.'or 30yds. First
man glanced at his tract, crumpled it up, and hit it
prettily to leg with his walking-stick ; second recipient
(a boy) rolled his into a marble and fired it, in approved
style, off his knee. Third, rolled his up and bowled a leg-
break : while the fourth (a youth) puiited a goal through
vacant space into a neighboring tree-guard. Not to be
outdone, I gave mine a lovely right hook, and fair on the
point. I remember wishing it was Tommy B—, but no
matter. There were no trains that morning, that’s why I
was walking.
LIFE’S HANDICAP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The Handicap is free for all; we face the starter’s gate
Upon the racecourse, which is Life—but shall we all run
straight ?
When God allots our handicaps, I wonder does He guess
How little weight will leave the best of riders in distress.
And when we’re stringing down the course, I often
wonder if
He sees who’s riding for a fall, and knows who’s running
stiff?
The reckless riders take the lead—the crafty edge inside ;
But if by riding foul they win, are they disqualified ?
There’s room enough for dirty tricks at corners of the
course 1
I wonder is allowance made for any losing horse ?
Are any protests entertained ? Are idle ones let go ?
And does the Judge see everything, and does the Steward
know !

The garish horde of sly-grog sellers is said
to have increased by about 30 per cent, in
southern M.L. prohibited districts during the
last year, and when the new grogless centres come
under the ban on Ist July the condition of things
may be conjectured. But it is a crumb of comfort
for the Cold Tea party to know that Prohibition
will likely remain the vogue, even after next
election. In the first place the no-license party
will always be on hand. Then the sly grog-
sellers will naturally work tooth and nail for
prohibition ; and again (as in Clutha) people will
become so used to having liquor in their houses
that they won’t want hotels. The Prohibitionists,
however, intend bringing forward a Bill prohibit-
ing the importation of grog, and then real trouble
may be expected.
NOT A DISEASE.
A cough is not a disease, but a symptom. It
indicates that the lungs and bronchial tubes are
inflamed. This inflammation often leads to
pneumonia. The surest way to ward off pneu-
monia is to use Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy on
the first appearance of the cough or cold. It
always cures, and cures quickly. Is. 6d.*

THE PULLMAN AUTOHATIC VENTILATOR (the invention of the famous inventor and builcer of the
luxurious Pullman Railway Carriages) admits into any room equipped with it a constant snpp y of outside fresh air
free from dust, smoke, or wet, and ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT DRAUGHT, irrespective of weather conditions,
gently diffuses the air and also acts as an exhaust. IT LOLVES ABSOLUTELY THE PROBLEM OF HEALT
VENTILATION. For sleeping apartments, offices, hospitals, lodge and smoking rooms, factories, halls, public
buildings, enclosed vehicles, schools, churches, &c., the invention is invaluable. It can be fitted to the window or
brickwork without disfiguring the original structure, and cost is so moderate as to bring the im ention within reacn
of the householder of most modest means. VENTILATE AND THUS REMOVE ONI, Or THE PRINCIPAL

Premier Philp has been going round with
unusual energy extolling the good deeds and
backbone of the present Queensland Government,
and imploring the people not to lean on the
Government lest the bone breaks. Philp’s
Government leans mostly on the British money-
lender, and the latter leans on the Queensland
taxpayer for his interest, and when the tax-
payer leans on the Government in turn, it makes
a very shaky and disreputable triangle. Philp
and co. will have to do another lean, or loan (it
amounts to the same thing) next June, when the
£400,000 deficit happens.
A naive letter to S.M. Herald from one
,; F. A. Salusbury, ” officebearer in several branches
of the N.S.W. “Reform” League, and a strong
advocate of that body’s stirring platform, started
with the big heading “Suspend the Income Tax !”
and demanded to know :
Will any of our reform leaders undertake to abolish the
income tax or suspend the operation of the Act for such
time as the Federal tariff continues in force ?
As the Federal tariff will be in force as long as
there is a Commonwealth, Salusbury wants to
find a leader who will advocate the permanent
abolition of the income tax regardless of conse-
quences. An eminent of that sort
should be easily found—but the demand is a sorry
giving away of the show. The “ Reform ” party
is supposed to want to abolish the deficit first of
all, and this ugly rush to abolish its own special
tax-burdens first looks bad.
If G. H. Reid would only keep his
humorous gifts for the law-courts and leave
politics alone ! Arguing before N.S.W. Supreme
Court in the “ soldier’s pay ” case, he had a hope-
less brief for plaintiff, but managed to make
things nasty for the other side. Some of the
argument :
Mr. O’Connor argued that if soldiers had civil rights
they might, when asked to storm a position, refuse and
seek to apply to the civil courts for an order to restrain
the general from ordering them to do such a thing.
His Honor said that the principle contended for by Mr.
O’Connor was embodied in the lines, “Theirs not to
reason why, theirs but to do and die.”
Mr. Reid : The “doing” in this case appears to be of
another sort. (Laughter.)
His Honor said that if the soldiers had civil rights they
might swarm into the. law-courts in time of war instead
of going to the battle-fields.
Mr. Reid said, since that was said, what were they to
think of the Government after offering certain pay, and,
when it was claimed, raising such a point ?
His Honor : They have raised it.
Mr. Reid : Of course, it is not a matter to talk of in
this court, but after all the brilliant eloquence of the
Premier
His Honor : Now, Mr. Reid. (Laughter.)
Mr. O’Connor’s voice was also heard in protest.
Mr. Reid : I have got that much in. (preat laughter.)
Constipation and Piles.
Permanently Cured by Bile Beans.
“ Some time ago I had a severe attack of piles,
brought on, I think, by constipation.” says Mr.
Geo. Neale, of Mary-street, South Singleton. “ I
suffered intense agony always, when either sitting,
lying down, or standing. I tried many so-called
remedies, but without avail. I Was, happily,
advised to give Bile Beans a trial, which I did.
The first few doses afforded me great relief, and
subsequently the piles disappeared, and I feel
assured that by taking an occasional dose of t! e
Beans, thus keeping my bowels clear, the Piles
will return no more. My wife and ag< d mother
also use Bile Beans, the former for biliousness and
the latter when she feels at all out-of-sorts. I can
confidently recommend the Beans to anyone
similarly afflicted.” Bile Be ins have now a world
wide reputation for curing biliousness, headache,
indigestion, constipation, piies, debility, female
weaknesses, nervousness, bad blood, pimples and
all skin eruptions, bad breath, anaemia, loss of
appetite, rheumatism, and by giving tone to the
system will ward off coughs, colds and influenza.
Bile Beans are obtainable from all medicine
vendors.*
“Tell them they shan t have a day
longer ; the game has been played for all it’s
worth.” — Thomas Bent, Vic’s. Minister for Rail-
way Breakdowns, t’other day, when asked to extend
the period during which freight on starving sto k
should he nothing or near it. Several papers
headed the reply as “A Brutal Speech,” “An
Offensive Reply ” ; and so it is—offensiveness and
hoggishness are innate with Bent. But when
this same Bent spoke thus, and worse, to the
unfortunate railway men who to his face dared
to uphold their rights, the same papers came out
with headings about “A Firm Minister,” “Mag-
nificent Ministerial Attitude,”~etc. Yah !
George Reid has, of late, turned various
somersaults almost simultaneously. (1) He told
the people of Sydney that the proposed trans-
continental line to Westralia was a shameful
waste of money and a device to catch votes ; and
he also told the people of Westralia that if he
were Premier the line would have been com-
menced long ago. (2) He was elected in Sydney
on a platform of direct taxation ; and he lately
stumped Tasmania declaring that he had never
advocated Federal direct taxation. (3) He was
the man who introduced to Australia (when he
did his famous backdown and said “Yes, Mr.
Chamberlain’’) the educational test for keeping
out colored aliens, and he now denounces that
test with extraordinary fury.

“ Mulberry ’’ on victuals :
Re “ T.D.” and his wail about the disappearance of
“ colonial goose.” I remember about 30 years ago, at a
tavern in the west end of Little Collins-st., Melb., a great
dish, and one frequently served up, was known as
“ Barwon goose.” The said “goose” consisted of sea-
gulls, curried. The tavern at that time was much
frequented by civil servants who were engaged at the
west end of the city. The “ goose ” wasn’t too bad, but
was at times rather tough. It seems to have gone to the
same limbo as the “ colonial ” bird.
Letter received by a Melbourne matri-
monial agent:—
Sir, —What do you take me for? Am sending back
photo, by return post. I distinctly said I wanted a wife,
not a charwoman. You want to introduce me to an
angular, cross-eyed, half-bald spinster about 57 years of
age. She does not answer my description in any particu-
lar except that she has means. It is bad enough to have
to look to a matrimonial agency for a wife, but it is
simply intolerable when you try to inflict upon me for
life a sour-faced old maid that has been scouring the
globe for a husband for 40 years. Please post another
photo, if you have one available, and don’t try to palm off
any more faded goods upon me.
It is well for their peace of mind that one half the
customers of the matrimonial agencies don’t know
the dreadful language the other half uses when it
sees the photograph.
CROTTPY CHILDREN.
If your children are subject to croup, watch for
the first symptom of the disease—hoarseness. If
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is given as soon as
the child becomes hoarse, the attack can be avert-
ed. Even after the croupy cough has appeared
the attack can always be prevented by giving this
remedy. It is also invaluable for colds and
whooping cough. It always cures, and cures
quickly. Is. fd.*
N.S.W. Railway Commissioners have de*
cided to remove the iron bars which at present block
the windows of the “ American J> type of carriage
exclusively used on the Sydney suburban railway
service. This is to be done gradually as the cars
come in for repairs, and has been determined on
in consequence of representations to the Depart-
ment that these bars would aggravate loss of life
in the event of accident, owing to the difficulty in
extricating the passengers. Considering that a
frightful disaster did occur over five years ago
in Redfern Station yard, when, owing to this very
fact, several persons were severely scalded, it is
evident that it takes time to make an impression
on the Department. The alteration should have
been made years ago. The reason of the bars
ever being placed there is lost in antiquity.

HAVE YOU READ THE
STORY ARIGHT * . • .
Mangatoki, Eltham, Taranaki N.Z
May 21st, 1902. ’
Dear Sirs: One of our children was
apparently fading away, but from what
cause we could not determine. Mr. Alex
McMinn, a journalist, saw our child and ad-
vised us to try Scott’s Emulsion, which he was
sure would benefit her, as it had done in the
case of a granddaughter of his own. On giv
ing it the visible improvement began from the
second or third day. Continuing its use the
child improved rapidly, eventually becoming
perfectly robust and healthy, and has enjoyed
excellent health ever since. We feel confident,
but for of*Qtt s Emulsion, we could not have
reared the child. Yours faithfully
(Signed) D. Herlihy!

HAVE YOU READ THE STORY
ARIGHT > A child’s face will always tell
you a true story of what is the matter when
illness has attacked the child. You may not
be able to determine exactly what ails it; that
is not easy even to practised eyes. The child
tells you very straightly and very plaintively
that it is physically unwell, and this is the
moment of all moments when you should read
the story aright! If you do read it aright, you
will give the child
SCOTT’S EMULSION. Because,
whatever may be the specific disease from
which the child may be suffering, Scott’s
Emulsion instantly, almost, builds up the
child’s strength, and gives that extra power
of resistance which it needs to throw out the
disease. This is the great secret why Scott’s
Emulsion always cures. It will cure your
child, even if you are not able to recognise the
disease. There is but one thing you have to
do; and that is, to see that on the wrapper of
the bottle there is a picture of a man carrying
a big cod-fish; if that cod-fish is not there,
you are not getting what we promise you—
—a cure! You can obtain a sample of
Scott’s Emulsion and the choicest children’s
booklet of the year, “ A Bunch of Roses,”
beautifully printed in colours, by sending
sd. to Scott & Bowne, Ltd., 483 Kent-street,
Sydney, and mentioning this paper. All
chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

TO WOMEN
WHO SUFFER FROM
KIDNEY.. LIVER DISEASE
Amongst life’s cruellest problems are the pain and suffering which many women are called upon
to endure. The radiant days of girlhood have scarcely passed ere the immature woman is forced to
assume the burden of her sex, and in many instances, she never again knows the enjoyment of
perfect health. The health of woman, too, is of supreme importance. Upon it depends the vigor of
posterity. The happy home life of husband and children is based upon the cheerfulness and content-
ment of the wife and mother. To the credit of woman, be it said, she carries her troubles, and
continues to present a smiling face, under circumstances which would strain to breaking point the
nervous system of the strongest man. But even woman, with all her wonderful power of endurance,
cannot stand the pressure of suffering indefinitely without aid. Thousands of women have cause to
bless the day when first they tried the healing, health-restoring effect of Warner’s Safe Cure. The
following letters from women are quoted in order that other women, who similarly suffer, may learn
how to regain health and strength even though they may have resigned themselves, in desperation, to
the prospect of never being thoroughly well again.
Mrs. R. L.
Head, Vine Cottage, Second Street, Port Pirie, S.A., says:—
“ It is with the greatest pleasure that I write to tell you of the great and lasting benefit I derived
rom the use of Warner s Safe Cure, for I feel that, but for that medicine, I should now be in my
grave. 1 had been suffering for a very long time from a complaint common to women of middle age.
was losing flesh at an alarming rate. The doctors could do nothing for me, and I commenced to
use arner s Safe Cure with a very forlorn hope. Greatly to the surprise of myself and friends, I
began to improve in health from the first bottle. I continued to take the medicine, and gained health
and strength every day. In a few weeks I was up and about my household work, and am now quite
stout and in good health.” H
Mrs. E. Bade, Camrock, Elwood Street, North Brighton, Vic., says :
i 6 pnDVfid Warner s Safe Cure to be a most wonderful medicine when suffering from that
anguid and tired feeling most women are subject to, and which makes one unfit to attend to one’s
household duties. In my case Warner’s S ife Cure had an immediate and lasting beneficial effect.”
Mrs. M. A. Cherry, Lake Street, Perth, W.A., says:—
i som ? time I had been gradually declining in health, suffering from nervous exhaustion. My
louroio work became a burden tome. I had to sit down and rest after the slightest exertion.
I Ins state continued until I became quite prostrated. I was advised to take Warner s Safe Cure by
someone who had received great benefit from it. When I had taken three bottles of the medicine I
oecame quite strong again, my energy and vigour returned, and my work became a pleasure to me
once more.
Emma Darvell, Ladies’ Nurse, 8 Carlton Street, Prahran,
says:—
tvii I p^ to , re P°rt the benefit I derived from taking Warner’s Safe Cure and Warner’s Safe
Afte . r T an y, y ears of pain and suffering from kidney and liver complaint, I, who was accus
tomed to minister to others, was brought to a bed of sickness myself, and the doctors could give me
no hope of recovery or relief they giving me but a short time to liye. At last I tried Warner’s Snfe
Cure. I rom the first bottle I began to improve in health. Gradually the pain left me. I continued
to take the medicine for some time, until I was perfectly cured and sound in bodv and in mind. I
ha\ e continued to keep well ever since, though some years have elapsed since that time. I may state
that the doctors were more than surprised to see me up again. I have heard of many other cases
during my professional career which have been cured by Warner’s Safe Cure.”

rather than the exception. This is not a question
of philanthropy, but of practical business, the em-
ployer realising that, to get the best results from
his hands, he must provide for their comfort
and cleanliness. Labor-saving machinery is
encouraged by the unions, and the inventor thereof
is encouraged by the employer. Finally, from
the cash point of view only, “ the American work-
man is at the week-end, taking all things into
(including every detail of the cost
of living), better off than his English brother by
2o per cent (This takes no account of the fuller
and better life he leads by reason of his superior
education, the comforts he enjoys at home and at
work, and the respect he has for himself as a
fairly, if not adequately, paid worker in the
human army ) Evidently, if Protection creates,
as Sprite Myth, Yes-No Reid, M'Millan and
other interested parties claim, a race of millionaire
monopolists, it is also liable to create a race of
self-respecting, cultivated, well-paid workers
which I reetrade, as instanced by the case of Eng-
land, is liable not to do.
One of the first returns laid before the Australian
Parliament this session showed that under the
Immigration Restriction Act 653 persons were
refused admittance last year. These included 459
Chinese, 29 Africans, 22 South Sea Islanders, 17
Japs, and 11 Hindoos. At the same time 1079
Chinese were admitted on State permits, 56 under
tonnage regulations (!), and 168 in conformity
with the Act. Also 513 Japs entered the Com-
monwealth, 246 under a just-dead treaty, 11 on
consular certificates, 21 accredited by the Japanese
Govt., 7 on State permits, 28 complied with the
Act, 188 were engaged in pearling operations, and
12 were returned to Australia as deserters (!!).
Thus 1086 colored aliens w'ere admitted on State
permits, while 196 were allowed, to comply with
the Act —for be it remembered that Act is wide
enough to shut out all humanity if the persons
who administer it so desire. It looks as if the
White Australia policy is still a long way from
being practised.
Labor federation is in the air in Westralia. The
two Trades and Labor Councils (coastal and gold-
fields), the Fremantle Trades Hall Association,
and all the big unions not affiliated with these
bodies, have joined to form the W.A. division of
the Australasian Labor Federation, and have
started business by taking over the running of
the Federal elections. A scheme for a closer
internal federation is now being argued out by
the unions on the coast. At present there are
four executives in Perth and Fremantle, and their
mutual bickerings are a never-failing source of
“ copy ”to the reporters. The new scheme, now
practically agreed upon, proposes to abolish these
executives, and federate all the unions on the
coast between Geraldton and Albany in an Indus-
trial Council. When that Council saunters on
the scene, the Perth Fatman will wake with a
start to find the most powerful (because the most
united) trades council in Australia prodding him
in the rear. It’s a healthy sign to see the unions
beginning to believe in unity.
Our Friend the Leper.
“ Ne’ek-do-weel ” writes :
“ Every country that has tried it, ha« had to pay a
heavy price for importing colored labor to work in its
sugar plantations. The West Indies, where Hindus
were introduced, are now over-run with leprosy; at
Trinidad there is one of the largest leper asylums in the
world.”—(Bulletin, 16/5/’03.)
The above is hardly according to fact. To state, or to
allow it to be inferred, that the appalling leprosy in the
West Indies dates from the introduction of the Hindus
to work in the canefields will not quite bear looking into.
When I was in Jamaica the sugar industry was fast col-
lapsing. It was deplorable to see the once magnificent
sugar estates over-run with rank luxuriant tropical vege-
tation , the splendid stone houses, aqueducts, reservoirs
and machinery houses moss-grown and falling into decay’
and the most expensive, up-to-date machinery rustino-
and rotting in idleness. It was in the endeavor to save
this dying industry that it was decided to import
Hindus, but I know that leprosy was so rampant
in the island, generations before' that, that it had
ceased to be looked upon as a matter of great or
even any moment. Leprosy there is said to be a 1 gacv
from the original white colonists, the result of their filthy
habits of life and an almost exclusively fish diet. I have
said that, in my day, it was looked upon as a matter of
small moment. There was a leper hospital for those who
could not afford private treatment, somewhere in the
scrub between Kingston and Spanishtown, which was, I
believe, guarded by a cordon of armed police, on account
of the lecherous habits which are a distinguishing charac-
teristic of lepers, but, so far as the moneyed class was
concerned, no precautions whatever were observed. I
have been watching a case in the police court, and' an
inspector, pointing over my shoulder to something on the
charge-sheet, has pulled off his glove, and a shower of
scales has fallen from his hand on to the paper. He
did not even apologise. I have lunched with a wealthy
family, one member of which has been brought to the
table in a chair and fed, his hands covered with a white
cloth. The other members of the family showed no signs
of the disease, and the sisters of the pitiful object in the
chair were remarkably pretty girls. None of the family
had the slightest objection to stating what was wrong
with their relative. They say in the West Indies that
leprosy is only communicable by direct inoculation, and
as leprosy generally skips one or two generations at a
time, a clean man (as to this particular disease) has but
slight hesitation in marrying a woman who, though
unaffected herself, has blood relations of the same
generation palpably affected, and vice versa. The West
Indians are, constitutionally, believers in the motto
“ sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,” and a pair,
married as above, know that there is little likelihood of
their offspring being tainted. If leprosy breaks out in
their grand or great-grandchildren, well, that will be
their look-out. I used to know the West Indies well,
and the same conditions of life apply to nearly all of
them—Jamaica, Barbadoes, Trinidad, St. Luoia,
Demerara, Honduras, etc.


Joe Chamberlain’s preferential idea recog-
nises the fact that everyone has a preference for
some thing or another. The most preferential
brand of whisky in every country where drinkers
use their intelligence is D.C.L., and as this is the
brand for inspiring business men to action, it may
have had something to do with Joseph’s wily
notion. D.C.L. the preferred whisky.*
The few millions of sheep that have
outlived the droughts in this country of
too much climate do not necessarily owe
their salvation to be law of the survival of
the fittest. But with Tattoo Oil, the well-known
sheep marker, the case is very different. Because
Tattoo is the finest and only safe branding oil.
It keeps on surviving to a large extent every year
and all the time.*
In these times of cut-throat competition when
profits are either swept away or reduced to a minimum,'
the ordinary mind is puzzled as to economy in working.
In almost every instance the solution lies in one word—
“ haulage.” The margin of profit in many undertakings
entirely^depends upon an economical method of haulage
and those interested in this question should communicate
with Mr. A. E. Leplastrier, 40 Hunter-street, Sydney,
Manager for the Central Tramway Co., as by means of
light and cheap Tramways and suitable rolling stock
economical and expeditious haulage in all weathers is
assured. ' Plants can be supplied for manual, animal or
locomotive traction.*
The man who wakes up in the morning with a
firm conviction that while he slept Satan was using his
tongue as a gridiron, and wdth a pain across the small of
his back, invariably yearns, with a deep, religious yearn-
ing, for something cool, refreshing, and fizzy. The
Gardner Spa Water, supplied in bottles or casks by Owen
Gardner and Co., of Brisbane, is the thing he requires—
the thing above all others. It gives life a sudden zest,
and the system begins to buck up like a thirsty land in a
monsoon after seven years’ drought.*

Great Fingall Consols (W.A.) appears to have
got over its annual meeting fairly successfully, all things
donsidered. The opposition insisted on getting its
ftbminee.W.T. Jones—familiarly known as “Bravo” Jones
£-on the board; but, apart from that, the malcontents
did not score much. Objection was taken to Monkhouse,
Btoneham and Co., as auditors, owing to part of that
firm and part of Bewick, Moreing’s firm (the managers)
being inextricably mixed up in company promotions,
but the objection was overruled. Bewick-Moreing’s con-
duct of the mine was eulogised, but history hardly
endorses the eulogy. When originally known as Con-
solidated Murchison, co. started with 20-head of stamps
and a w’orking capital of £25,540. After treating 18,000
tons of practically surface stone for 10,7130 z., an average
of 12dwt., the concern collapsed. Reconstructed w'ith a
Working capital of £39,469, a new battery of 40 head
was acquired, another 19,303 tons produced 16,5320 z.
(an average of I7dwt.), and co. again went bung,
owing no less than £lB,OOO. Including proceeds of
gold won, the total sum expended was £150,000,
‘plus £lB,OOO then owing. Thus £168,000 was
spent in four years, and the deepest workings were 300 ft.,
and no ore reserves were in sight. The co. was finally
reconstructed in May, 1899, and paid its first div. two
years later, in June, 1901. By this time at least
£250,000 had been spent on the mine. If ever a good
mining proposition was bungled Great Fingall Consols is
that mine. The shareholders, nevertheless, confirmed
the renewal of the managers' agreement for a further
five years at £4OOO a year. The staff also gets 2 per cent,
on divs., which percentage will not be less than £7500 to
£lO,OOO a year. The West Fingall blocks, which are
absolutely worthless, were repurchased for £47,832 in
cash. Wonderful are the ways of British mine share-
holders.
* * * *
' Lake View South (W.A.) may yet have a good
run for its money in the recently purchased Robinson
mine, Kanowna. It was condemned five years ago as
valueless below the 100 ft. level, notwithstanding that
from above that level 34,000 tons had been gutted out for
31,5000 z. Four other managers since then have done
nothing with it. Tributors then got to work and made a
little fortune ; several thousand ounces of gold have been
won, all from above the 200 ft. level, April return being
3580 z. from 452 tons. At 200 ft. the reef is fully 12ft. wide
but low grade. Shaft is now being sunk to 300 ft., and,
so far as anyone can foresee, mine may prove a very good
proposition. Anyhow, the previous condemnation was
quite unwarranted. The mine’s equipment is so primi-
tive that it looks like the work of ancient Phoenicians.
* * * *
Associated (W.A.) is dismantling the two old
Ropp furnaces and substituting six Merton furnaces.
This should reduce costs by nearly ss. a ton, and very
materially,increase percentage of extraction. Many other
Improvements are being made. A 20-head mill is to be
installed to treat free milling ores, and a dynamo for
running all the machinery by electricity is to be erected.
Manager Gleisberg is putting a good deal of vim into his
rnanagement, and it looks as if he would gradually get
the mine into shape to earn divs. The drive to connect
the two shafts at 1000 ft. is being pushed ahead, and,
when connected, cost of haulage will be considerably re-
duced. The Oroya chute has so far proved a Will-o’-the-
Wisp. This co. is in a very strong position financially,
having £150,000 invested in British Consols.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) is nowin charge
of G. M. Roberts, late metallurgist and understudy of
Hamilton, of the Great Boulder. All sorts of rumors are
afloat about the mine, but the only one likely to be true
is that the reserves of rich smelting ore are almost
depleted, and that another two months will see the end
of such returns. It is also asserted, and with a good
deal of truth, that the timbering and mullocking of the
mine will now entail a good deal of expense. Nothing
has yet transpired as to the ore body at 912 ft., but the
Shaft is very near the spot now. On the Iron Monarch
two bore holes have been completed, and a third is on
the way. These three will test the full length of the
property. Great secrecy is displayed as to the result, but
the possibility of the lease turning out a gold mine is
fairly hopeful.
>- Golden Link (W.A.) has been doing very well
on its Eclipse lease, and is making a profit of about
£40,000 a year. Allowing for London exes, this should
ensure a div. of 10 per cent, per annum. The battery is
to be increased by five head, which should bring the out-
put to 3000 tons monthly, as the old second-hand 10-head
is treating 2000 tons. This addition should nearly double
profits. The lode is being stoped out for a width of 40ft.,
with some 20,000 tons of half-ounce ore in sight. Three
levels are being driven, and development can easily be
kept ahead pf milling. The Golden Link lease, adjoining
.the Lake View Consols, is said to be looking better, but
it has been such a long-drawn-out disappointment that
one can hardly be blamed for being a sceptic on that
point. Co. has issued 353,183 of its 400,000 shares, on
which is an uncalled assessment of 2s. a share. Financially
it is therefore strong. The continuation of the Eclipse
lode should be found in the Kalgoorlie Amalgamated,
which is now looking so much better that the directors
have decided to appoint a manager and go in for
systematic mining, instead of mere diamond-drilling.
Ballarat’s hopes have been severely blighted.
The South Star has flickered out of existence. For nearly
a quarter of a century it has been a mine of mighty
expectations, but it has badly failed to realise them. It
has shattered many fortunes. The last run produced
3trained relations between certain reputedly wealthy
mining men and their bankers. Over £350,000 has been
spent on the mine to demonstrate that it is a duffer. At
any rate, the late owners seem to be satisfied on that
score, as they have taken every moveable article out of it.
At the present time Ballarat proper has not a regular
dividend-paying quartz mine.

Queen Cross Reef (Charters Towers) put up a
record for May with 76720 z. from 2572 tons. During the
past half-year the value of the gold won was £116,456,
and divs. totalled, £90,000, equal to £5OO per day, Sun-
days and holidays included. Mine manager Waters must
thank his stars for quitting Mount Macdonald (N.S.W.)
when he did.

All the world’s a stage, and most of us want to take

You can never hope to reach the top rung of the
theatrical ladder if you are too careful where you step.
“ Melb.” : English, you know ! The band parts of
“My Lady Molly ” did not arrive in time. Consequently,
Caron scored them, and produced theopera. Afterwards
the band scores came, and the press remarked on the
great improvement. Then it had to eat humble pie, with
the announcement that Williamson had stuck to Caron s
scoring because it was so much better than the imported
scores, and that the latter had never been used at all.
Strange that two of It. S. Smythe’s most successful
star lecturers—Charles Clark and Max O’Rell—should
pass out within a month. The Much-Travelled has not
been associated with a very long list of notables, for he
picked only the good things. The death of two of them
so recently will make the survivors feel nervous, and we
may hear of another one following suit. If R.S.S.had to
nominate the victim The Bulletin could guess him first
try.
Nellie Stewart told a Dunedin interviewer that when
last in Maoriland she met a man who travelled 60 miles to
see “Patience.” To be quite sure of witnessing this
masterpiece he was noticed waiting outside the theatre
at 11 a.m. He was still there at 6.30, when the prima
donna went to the theatre. At 11 p.m., when the per-
formance was over, Miss Stewart tripped over a recumbent
form, and saw in the light that it was the 60-mile man,
but dead drunk. He had not been in the theatre, his
own patience having become exhausted just before the
doors opened. ...
Herr Plock, who had gone eight years beyond the
“allotted span,” died a few days since. It was not
many weeks ago that the wife of Chief Justice Madden
appealed for funds to pro-
vide a presentation for
Melbourne’s ancient ball-
room bandmaster on his
exit from the festive
scene. Her letter to dear
old Plock enclosing cheque
for £56 13s. must have
reached him at almost the
last hour of his life, when
the veteran was not able
to moralise on the dimen-
sions of that tribute.
Wrote Mrs. Madden : “ All
your many friends who
have during rather more
than two generations
found their greatest plea-
sure and happiest experi-
ences associated with y our
music and kindly sym-
pathy, have learned, with
very real regret, that ad-
vancing years have caused
you to retire from the
active pursuit of your
profession.” And the
sympathy of all those
thousands of Melbourne’s
nicest frivollers—young,
middle-aged and otherwise
—was worth £56 13s. !
Which rather suggests that
the men who were lured into
matrimonial contracts by the
seductive strains of Plock’s
Band reckon the business was a
bad mistake.
“Hiphen”: Mark Hambourg of the massive mane hrs

At the best of times Brisbane is, from a financial point

arrived it is dreadfully severe on the travelling profesh.
No matter how thoroughly “off” a season is, and if the

Sheridan lately set a kindly example by paying every

“J.A.C.”: Those references (B. 6/6/’O3) to departing
strong-man Miller and the “ rastling ” introduced into
“ Julius Caesar ” remind one of the English tradition of
the eminent “fit-up” tragedian who, with a few inter-
polated heroic phrases, borrowed the first gravedigger’s
shovel and performed the spade-dance, in the graveyard
scene in “ Hamlet.”
Geelong boasts a ghost—a real air ghost. He resides
in a house in that City of the Dead. It is said that at a
certain hour (shake on the deep B flat, please) the ghost
appears (loud pedal), and, gliding to the mantelpiece,
leans his arms thereon and glares (run from top of key-
board right down to the wood) around. Then the light
grows blue (deep notes, pianissimo), an awful glare burns
in the ghost’s eyes (run from the lower G to the upper,
and back again); he raises his hand to his head (soft
pedal), and then, with a fearsome shriek (give her blazes
among the top notes), he springs into the air and disap-
pears (run from upper C down to the wood six times,
with loud pedal).
Max O’Kell toured Canada and the States five or six
times, but when he proposed a second visit to Australia
he couldn’t get Smythe to think of it. “ Even if the
public in general could overlook your contempt for the
Southern Cross,” said Smythe, “ the Sydney people would
never forgive your allusions to their alfresco amours, and
the daily procession of closed hansoms on the South
Head Road. I never could understand why you intro-
duced the hansom cabs into your book. That sort of
thing is not peculiar to Sydney. You see it all over the
civilised world.” “Yes, I know,” said Max, “ but you
don’t see it in the morning." Sydney struck him as being
pre-eminently the place where the early sinner catches
the flighty girl.
Said that manager Williamson has decided to fit Her
Majesty’s (Melb.) with hot water pipes for warming the
auditorium to a comfortable degree during (he winter
months. If so, he will find it the best investment he has
ever made. People complain bitterly that places of
entertainment in Victoria are constructed to suit a
Queensland winter climate. Melbourne is not the worst
place in this respect. The other night when Mark
Hambourg was appearing at Ballarat, friend Lemmone
had to put an oil stove in his dressing-room, or his
wonderful fingers would have stiffened with the cold.
Haddon Chambers, who once wrote an unsuccessful
play called “An Old Lady,” thinks of calling his next
play “ A Great Lady.”
Mrs. Brown Potter is about to stage a society drama of
the deepest sentimentality, written by an English country
vicar under her gentle guidance. This comes of Mrs.
Potter's recent weakness for giving recitations in churches
and other haunts of the godly. The parsons have now
begun to sell her their tame dramas.
“ Hamlet ” : Geo. Musgrove paid Adelaide a flying visit,
and ’tis said he gave the “ Fortune Teller” crew such a
rough time that, as soon as they saw his back, they felt
like getting on the beer out of sheer joy. He witnessed
the Wednesday matinee of “The Chow Honeymoon” when
it was in its second week, and, though it had only two
nights to run, called a rehearsal next morning, and—
U gh i—talk of an editor’s scissors and paste, they were
nothing to be compared with G.M. hacking the “Honey-
moon ” about. They say he advised one man not to “ act
the d n marionette”—but then the air was full of good
advice that day.
Talking of the new boom in dramatisations of Dickens,
somebody revives the story of how the novelist came to
change his plot for “The Old Curiosity Shop.” Whilst
the story was still being issued in monthly numbers the
pirate playwrights got to work upon it, and presently
there were half-a-dozen dramas going, every oneof which
had a joyful ending. Little Nell was alive, and likely to
get married in every case. So Dickens killed little Nell.
Miss Ethel E. Robinson, who beat all
Australia in the Federal public service general
division examination, being the only candidate in
the Commonwealth to secure the entire possible
number of marks, is 17 years old, and resides at
Castlemaine (Vic.), where she was trained in onr
of the local State schools.
In May, 40 men and 38 women aged 70
years and upwards died in Sydney ; aged from 70
to 79 there were 56 ; 80 to 89, 20; one at 91, and
one at 93 years.
Sydney Daily Telegraph published in
its issue of May 30 a letter from its London
correspondent dated 24th April, headed “ Where
are the Protectionists?” and pooh-poohing the
idea of the growth of a Protectionist feeling in
England. The same issue contained cablegrams
from London, dated just five weeks later, about
the speeches of Britain’s Prime Minister and his
most prominent colleague urging the country to
alter its whole fiscal policy. It has always been
one of the curious features of the D.T. that it is
edited so carelessly that the paper often succeeds
in saying two exactly opposite things in the one
issue.
The other day secretary Scorer, of the
Vic. engine-drivers, cabled to Canada asking the
Government if there was work there for the men
whom Bent had squeezed out; and the Australian
Freetrade papers simply laughed themselves
hoarse when the reply came back that the Govern-
ment only offered special inducements to agricul-
turists. Most of the papers said that this proved
what a high value Canada placed upon agriculture
and the other “great natural producing indus-
tries.” It didn’t seem to occur to them that,
obviously, the “great natural industries” of
Canada are the only ones that don’t offer good
enough prospects to the local population, where-
fore the Government has to offer a special bonus
to the foreign agriculturist to come in.
WHAT FELL ON OWESULLIVAN.
“A member of the deputation, which was asking for
the construction of the Temora-Barellan railway, ven-
tured to inquire if the line could not be constructed out
of revenue. The Minister was startled at such a proposi-
tion. ‘Oh! no,’ he said, when he had recovered his
self-possession. ‘It’s a reproductive work, and must be
constructed out of loan funds.’”—S.M. HERALD REPORT.
HOW HE RECOVERED.—(By an artist who
wasn't on the spot.)
A correspondent, from Broken Hill, al-
leges this :
A young woman was before a country court charged
with vagrancy. She was discharged to the custody of a
friend, hut is now in a Salvarmy rescue home earning,
probably, a good deal more than her keep. The father
of the girl is an old-age pensioner, but he doesn’t see a
red cent of his pension, which is received by a friend of
the pensioner and handed to the Salvarmy home for the
“ support ” of his daughter.
The latest Sydney Telegraph hoax is to
the effect that there is, in the demand that the
Freetrade papers shall pay the parcel rates which
have for many years been fixed by law, but which
they have long evaded, a conspiracy of some kind
to benefit the Victorian press. No particulars
are given, but the vague, general lie has been
told with such vigor that Clarke, M.H. R., has
put a question on the Representatives’ notice
paper about the “conspiracy.” The best thing
the Reps, can do is to summon the Telegraph
editor to the bar of the House, and tell him to
bring details of the outrage with him.
Premier Philp, of Queensland, says his
programme for the coming session (there being a
general election close at hand) will include adult
suffrage and reduction of the Assembly to 50 or 60
members. Also he proposes to increase the dura-
tion of Parliament to four years. Philp likewise
assures the country that he hasn’t been extrava-
gant. Perhaps he hasn’t. All Queensland knows
is that he managed to increase the expenditure by
.£1,000,000 compared with Nelson’s figures, and
the Premier who runs up expenditure from to
4J millions looks worse than extravagant—he
looks like a dangerous political lunatic.
Queensland Premier Philp has been
making what the cheap colored-labor papers call
“ trenchant remarks ” :
There are some things at Atherton which I do not like.
A number of men who are crying out for a “ white Aus-
tralia ” have taken land from the Queensland Government
at half-a-crown an acre, and are sub-letting it to Chinamen
at £1 per acre. Now, these men were loudest in their
cries for a “ while Australia,” and for no black man or
Chinaman to be in Australia.
Now will Philp explain how he knows, just by
paying a flying visit to Atherton, that the men
who have sub-let land to Chinese are of the White
Australia party, and do not belong to the
large nigger-labor minority in that district which'
voted for Philp’s own candidate ? Unless he can
shown that he does know, the public has the privi-
lege of thinking him a mean, unscrupulous slan
derer if it feels that way.

There are Men Living in
Australia To-Day
whose lives are failures, who are dying by inches. Illness has brought them
adversity, ill-health has destroyed their energy. They have NEVER REACHED
the goal for which they have striven. They have lost hope and ambition.. In this

make it worth the living.
Disease means an ENEMY. It may mean Death. A man likes to feel strong,

to treat such diseases. The SPECIALISTS of
The Freeman & Wallace Institute
he should consult, who practise in the front rank of Science, and whose keen insight
into diseases, and whose singular skill in CURING THEM have made their names
famous over Australia. Their ELECTRO-THERAPEUTIC methods, or the treat-
ment of Nerve Diseases by ELECTRICITY and MEDICINE, have been endorsed
by some of the leading persons of the land. In all instances where this treatment
has been adopted, speedy and
Remarkably Curative effects have Resulted,
the patients enjoying better health than they have experienced for years.
Here is the testimony of a splendid athlete, the finest art-cyclist who has visited
Australia, now starring the States under contract to Mr. Harry Rickards, the great
Vaudeville King. MR. ARTHUR HILL, of “Hill and Sylvainy,” whose portrait
is here published, recently injured his back, suffering from
A Severe and Serious Strain,
which affected the kidneys and threatened to incapacitate him. Here is his testi-
mony to the SPECIALISTS’ ONE POUND ELECTRIC ‘‘ INVIGORATOR ’
BELT and to their Magical Electro-Medical treatment. In plain terms in a letter
to the SPECIALISTS he informs the public of Australia what it did for him —
“During April of this year I strained the
muscles of my back, which threatened complete
prostration. To regain my nerve and muscular
strength speedily, I wore one of your much spoken
of Electric “ INVIGORATOR ” BELTS, and adopted
your treatment, It is a wonderfully curative in-
strument, for in a few days I regained that mus-
cular power essential to the great feats of strength
involved in my professional career.
“ (Signed) ARTHUR HILL

The Cure of the Century. Remarkable Cases of Relief.
Any man who may be ill or weak from any cause may regain his lost strength
in a few weeks by adopting THE SPECIALISTS’ wonderful modes of nerve
re-invigoration. Their'' Electric “ INVIGORATOR ” Belts are constructed
upon the finest scientific, plans. They are locally manufactured, and locally
certificated.
They are Sold for One Pound Only,
and can be worn by any member of a family. £8 is allowed in return for their £lO
Electric “INVIGORATOR” Belt, which contains 2oz. 18ct. gold, even after a cure
has been effected. Duty on all Belts is paid throughout the States. There is no
Functional, Nerve, Stomach, or Kidney Disease which this treatment will not
alleviate and cure.
All these “INVIGORATOR” Belts bear the highest awards from such high
electrical authorities as Mr. G. English, C.E., late Electrician to the New South
Wales Government Railways, and Mr. Albert Libby, Consulting Engineer for Allis,
Chalmers, Co., the largest electrical firm in the world, and who supervised the
formation of the present electric car service of Sydney. These certificates may be
inspected upon application.
THE SPECIALISTS have testimonies, in addition to Mr. Hill’s, from such men
as Mr. DANIEL O’CONNOR, M.P., Mr. PATRICK LARKIN, J.{\, Inspector
FOWLER, N.S. Wales Police, and numerous others. These are but a few instances.
They have cured numberless men from such grave diseases as DYSPEPSIA, INDI
GESTION, GOUT, NEURALGIA, SCIATICA, BLOOD COMPLAINTS,
BLADDER and
Liver Troubles, Prostratic Disorders, Varicocele, etc.
They have indisputable proof to this effect. Their Electric “ INVIGORATOR”
Belt, when worn round the waist nightly for a few hours, saturates the vital nerve
centres with a healthy natural energy. LACK OF NERVE FORCE is at the mot
of the above diseases. Electricity restores nerve-power, and the current, assisted by
strong reconstructive remedies, soon effects a radical cure. Only in a few instances
has it been proved that the electric current administered individually has benefited
the patient, and where such benefit has been proved the nerve-system was but slightly
impaired. No amount of Electricity alone will renew an old kidney, or create the
necessary tissue essential to perfect health, and when time and money is spent upon
such a form of treatment the chances of a radical cure are rendered more remote and
hopeless.
The Specialists’ Fees are: Advice and Medicine, £1 only.
When under treatment you are under the care of an Internationally Registered
Physician and Specialist, Dr. R. WALLACE, M.D., who is registered by Medical Boards of
New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, England and America. He is the only
Registered Specialist in Australia who thoroughly understands Electrical treatment. (See
New South Wales Registered Medical Practitioners’ List.)

T’other day, a firm which is compiling a
handbook on the industries—State and otherwise
—of Barataria sent an agent to approach a Cabinet
Minister as to the insertion of Government matter
and advertisements. The Minister’s photograph
appeared half-a-dozen times or so in the publica-
tion referred to. Most of the likenesses were
good, and the eminent statesman professed him-
self pleased; but suddenly he came across one
which represented him as clothed in a white
suit and absolutely devoid of facial expression.
The great man fired up immediately : “ And d’ye
think I’ll be a party to spending the country’s
money on a work that represents me as looking
just like a cockatoo on a blanky fence ! ”
Mat Toohey, father of Jim and Jack, who
have now followed the old man, always liked a
drink at a pub., although there was any quantity
of good stuff at home. His sight failing, the
gardener had to escort him to the pub. and bring
him back. One day the local “ talent ” were
baiting a Chinaman in the bar. “ You English-
man, John?” “No, me not Englishman.”
“ You Scotchman, John ?” “ No, me not Scotch-
man.” “You Irishman, John?” “No. me no
dam Ilishman.” Old Mat measured the distance
by his ears and threw his blackthorn. The Chow
got it across the nose. John Toohey had to
settle with the Chow unknown to the old fire-
eater. He would make no apology whatsoever.

Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has

It reproduces the human voice to such a fine point, that in listening

with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-

the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases

ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to

A Maoriland correspondent :
The art of politics in these intelligent democracies of
the South seems to be a convertible term for the art of
facing every way at the same time. I know of one
politician in this State who won a seat at the last elec-
tion. He drove a drag round the electorate, which drag
was provided by the brewers; his deposit was put up
by a Wesleyan parson, and he piously attended every
church service in the constituency from the high
Anglican and R.O. to the most obscure little Bethel.
He got the support of the football club, the Unitarians
and the Chinese. It would be a sorrowful thing if a truly
versatile man like that were left out.
The late Alderman Gatehouse (Melb.)
used to say that, during a period of great financial
stress in the Age office, years ago, he saved the
paper from extinction by voluntarily advancing
£3OOO. Also, he was in the habit of remarking
that he wished he hadn’t done it, although he was
repaid with interest.

Jock McPhail.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Woolshed burned, and eight men injured in a
most unequal fight.”
That was what the papers stated
In a telegram undated,
When the blacklegs came to Brenda, thief-like, at
the dead of night.
And the inference accepted by the city journalists
Found expression in the head-line, “ Outrage by
the Unionists ” ;
But the gods’ ungarnished gospel is this bold and
bitter tale
From the Never-Never classics, headed simply,
“Jock McPhail.”
Now the Brenda shed was Union when the Brown-
ings held the run,
Never shark or blackleg worked there under
Browning—sire or son ;
But, beneath the broker’s hammer, Brenda went
to “ Angel ” Gray,
And a stronghold of the Union with the freehold
passed away.
For the Angel was a mongrel with a sanctimonious
air,
Who had earned a reputation by his aptitude at
prayer;
And he spoke with ceaseless longing of the harp
and of the crown,
So it wasn’t any wonder that he cut the wages
down.
But the men who shore at Brenda when old
Browning bossed the board
Took a solemn oath and binding, every one in
stern accord,
That unless the full agreement in the Union terms
was made,
Not a man on Brenda station should so much as
sharpen blade.
Never word they said to super., never threat made
Angel Gray,
Till he posted up a notice at the shed one
Saturday—
“ Brenda shearing starts on Thursday. P.U.
terms.” They read the news ;
Then they formed a deputation to make manifest
their views.
But that shearers’ deputation had no leader elo-
quent,
And it simply kept repeating, when it lacked an
argument:
“Brenda shed has been a stronghold of the Union
in the past;
Brenda shed shall be a stronghold while the bonds
of Union last.”
And the Angel heard and answered: “I have
taken this in prayer
To the footstool of the Father, humbly wrestling
with it there,
And you have my ultimatum; take or leave it as
you like.”
“We’ll announce the benediction,” said M‘Swee-
ney : “Let us strike ! ”
So they formed a camp at Brenda and they
picketed the gates,
Picketed the route and roadways, watchful as
the sleepless Fates,
And the men the boss imported never entered
Brenda shed,
And the station hands he threatened joined the
shearers’ camp instead.
And the Angel’s heart was troubled, for, although
his ways were deep,
Whatsoever thing he ventured, lo ! the shearers
held him cheap;
And, at last, one Monday morning when a month
had passed away,
Game a notice of submission from the hands of
Angel Gray.
It was posted at the woolshed, and’the pickets
farthest out
Caught the ringing exultation of the shearers
round about,
And the cheer that thrilled through Brenda, with
its fervid euphony, ' . ‘ '
Was the loud Amen of Labor loyal unto victory.
There was gathering of outposts in a wild con-
fusion then,
Joy of hard-won battle beaming in the eyes of
half-fed men;
And the sentiments of Logan were re-echoed far
and wide
When he said, “Let’s celebrate it at the ‘Cattle
Drovers’ Guide.’ ”
So they journeyed to the shanty, and they drank
like warriors bold
When the flagons of our fathers filled the board in
days of old.
Drank and feasted ; but when midnight found
them full of maudlin glee,
Jock M'Phail rode through the darkness Brenda-
wards with Red M‘Gee.
Something crooked Jock was fearing, so they
sought the gloom of trees
In a wide half-circle northward of the tell-tale
southern breeze,
Riding cautiously and quickly till a broken shaft
of light,
Shining from the shearers’ humpy, told them that
M‘Phail was right.
Spectre-footed, then, and eager to the humpy
door they crawled,
Peered through chinks, wild-eyed with anger,
listening like men enthralled;
For they heard the Brenda super, to a stranger
hoarsely say—
“ There’ll be bloodshed here to-morrow, sure as
God made Angel Gray ! ”
Silently the door they opened, silently as shadows
passed,
Seized the super, and the stranger, fought with
them and bound them fast;
Then they forced the Angel’s purpose from the
super.—and M‘Gee
Mounted horse to warn the others of the boss’s
treachery.
But Red Mac. could scarce have reached them
when along the homestead track
Angel rode toward the humpy with the blacklegs
at his back;
“Open up!” he cried the super., “It is I! you
need not fear ! ”
Jock M'Phail alone made answer—“ Never scab
shall enter here ! ”
But they broke the door and rushed him. Still
M'Phail stood firm and true ;
With his back against a door-post blood with
every hit he drew.
Right and left they fell before him, right and
left, on either hand,
And the mark on Angel’s forehead is the Union
shearer’s brand.
And, perchance, the cause had conquered, but a
“ scab ” with blood a-flow
Climbed the hut and with a sapling struck
M'Phail a coward’s blow,
And with one great cry of anguish dying out into
. a groan
Sank the man who fought for Brenda, single-
handed and alone.
And the Angel, watching grimly, shouted when
he saw him fall;
Shouted and, with hot blood-hunger, showed his
baseness then to all :
“Hound of hell and spawn of harlot! this for
you, and this ! ” he cried,
And he struck the prostrate shearer, spurning
him with foot aside.
And he left him bleeding, senseless, seeking for
him later on
When the blacklegs’ swags were settled, but the
unionist was gone.
Broken-boned and weak and feeble, maddened by
his awful pain,
Spitting blood and sick and weary, Jook had
striven to rise in vain;
But he crawled toward the woolshed hand by
hand and knee by knee,
Blood trailed in the dusty saltbush, crooning ever
painfully—
“ Brenda shed a Union stronghold always was in
years gone past;
Brenda shed shall still be Union while the bonds
of Union last.”
Foot by foot he struggled onward where the silent
darkness lay;
Foot by foot, the hot blood flowing swiftly with his
life away; . C.
Foot by foot, until —Eureka! he could feel the
woolshed door;
Then the thought, of Earth’s to-morrow troubled
Jock M'Phail no more;
For beneath the woolshed creeping, coat and shirt
and bark in hand,
Only this his heart was crying as he slowly made a
brand—
“ Brenda shed a Union stronghold always was in
years gone past;
Brenda shed” —the brand was lighted—“shall be
Union to the last! ”
Gleams of light that grew and gathered ; burst of
flame that winglike spread,
Smiting all the bush with terror, all the sullen sky
with dread !
What though Unionist and blackleg worked like
heroes at the well—
Limned in flame and robed in glory Brenda shed
to ashes fell.
And the smoke-grimed Union shearers gathered
mournfully around,
Treading lightly o’er the ashes, for they trod on
holy ground;
And they swore an oath, bare-headed, by a slow
and bloody trail,
Still to fight and yet to conquer for the sake of
Jock McPhail.

PEARS
The Romance of the Munga-
whero.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We ate our lunch in the shade of the giant moun-
tain birches. Below us the landscape was unrolled
like a map, while immediately beneath, the broad
Mungawhero hurried down its rocky bed at 20
miles an hour and hurled itself over a splendid
cataract, sheer 200 feet, on to the basalt rocks
below, and sent up a cloud of spray which in the
sun and the moonlight made a perpetual rainbow.
The Maoris regarded the spot with superstition,
and even our rough axemen, who had mighty
little reverence about them, used to watch in
silent awe the wondrous fall and the trembling
rainbow. Tim, usually a man of strange swear-
words, said it was “the sort of place the saints
might live in, if it wasn’t so dashed wet.”
From where we stood the falling water looked
like an enormous veil, and I remarked on the
likeness to Turae, the guide. He regarded it
critically, shifted his pipe to the other side of his
face, and told us the name, which, for space rea-
sons, is here omitted, but being translated means,
“ The-place-where-Wini-the-wife-of-Renati-went-
through - the - veil - for - the - sake-of-the-white-man -
she-loved and-for-the-sake-of-the-brown - husband-
whom-she-loved-not.”
I passed the tobacco to Turae ; he cut off a fill,
slowly lit his pipe, and commenced :
“It was in the days when the Government sur-
veyor came through this country that Henare, his
scout, camped down there by the Mungawhero,
where our camp is to-day, just above the fall.
Renati, who was with the party, was no good
with the axe, and Henare sent him out to kill the
wild pigs that the men required for meat. For
that reason Renati was not always in camp at
nights, for when he pursued the pig far and came
to the places of the other Maoris, he would some-
times rest for a day or two. Then Henare would
use strong words, cursing Renati, and go out and
shoot pigs with his revolver.
“ The camp on the Mungawhero was a good ens,
and they stayed there long—many weeks. All
this time Renati hunted pigs, but killed few, and
stayed much in the kiangas around, and left his
wife Wini alone in the camp, and Wini was
angry. •
“Wini was beautiful with the beauty that the
pakeha likes. On her face were no marks of the
tattoo, and although she was married to Renati
her lips were not stained with blue 5 for she had
been among the children whom the pakehas saved
after the battle of Moteo, and whom they reared
in the missionary college at Wanganui when they
had slain the warriors of Titokowaru, and Tito
had become a Queen’s man. ;
“Henare, the scout, was a great man, even
among his own people, the pakehas. He could
shoot the pigeon that flew, with the revolver, and
no other pakeha or Maori have I ever known who
could do that. Also, he was strong, and when
the camp shifted he always carried the camp-oven
in his blankets so that dinner should not be late.
“Renati was a fool. He stayed in the kianga
where dwelt the missionary who taught that a
man may have as many wives as he can support,
and Renati was baptised by him and craved
Wiremu Te Nahu that he should give him his
daughter Arini for a second wife.
“ Wiremu was grim. He was oid, and he sat
over the fire day and night thinking of the past;
thinking of the days before Whitmore swept
through the land, and came down with the morn-
ing light and shot the Maoris in the strong places
even as they rose from sleep, Wiremu was sour.
He called for the young men, and Renati stood
waiting, thinking that Wiremu would place before
his sons the offer of marriage just made for Arini.
“ The young men came in and sat down around
the chief in a ring. Wiremu took no notice, but
sat there in his blanket, glowering into the fire.
The young men waited, for none would think of
speaking before so great a chief, the only chief
who had escaped out of the hands of the Little
Captain at Moteo, whose canoe had bounded past
the great wheel guns, leaped the chains and
dashed through the rain of fire. All these things
they remembered of the old man, and sat in
silence till he should be pleased to speak.
“ The old chief glowered into the fire a long
while. Suddenly he spoke : ‘ I called my young
men. Are they here?’ It was beneath the
dignity of so great a chief to look round and count
them.
“They answered him that they were indeed
present, and the old man slipped off his blanket
and bent closer to the fire, but he threw back his
head and half closed his eyes, as was his habit
when he was angry.
“ ‘ We have a daughter, Arini; as perhaps you
are all aware. Renati Hapuka has seen our
daughter Arini and would take her for wife. We,
the Te Nahus, are honored ! We would that all
our daughters were mated and that they had
many children, for the day of the Maori will not
come unless the young men and women have
many children, and can man down the pakeha,
and drive him into the great waters from which
he came.
“ ‘ But it has come to our ears that this black-
fellow, Renati Hapuka, hath a wife in the camp
of the white man Henare, who marks out the
land for the Queen. Henare, he takes the land
for the Queen, but the wife of Renati Hapuka he
takes for himself; and this nigger, having one
wife whom he cannot save from the white man,
wquld take as a second wife our daughter Arini,
that the next white man who comes along to mark
the laud for the Queen shall not miss overmuch
the white wahine he left in the big pah down by
the water. Cast me this blackfellow out of the
kianga, and set the kuris on him if he dare to
return.’
“They seized Renati suudenly, and they cast
him forth roughly, and bade him go to the camp
of Henare and inquire humbly of the white man
if he might return to his own tent.
“It was afternoon when Renati came down
the track and crossed the river on the ledge of
rock beneath the fall, in the place where the
rainbow is, for Renati was a bad man, and feared
not the spirit who dwells in the house made by
the light and the falling water.
“Wini sat on the river bank, singing the song
of the laughing water, and she made good the
rent in the blue and white shirt of Henare the
whiteman. Renati went into his tent, and saw
his own shirt all tattered. Wini cared only lor
the shirt of the pakeha, Henare.
“ Renati crossed over to where his wife was
sitting, carrying his tattered shirt in his hand,
but she touk no notice. He saluted her, but she
looked only into the waters and at the shirt ol
the. white man, which she was mending.
‘‘The cook came over and asked Renati where
were the pigs for which he waited. Renati cursed
his mother. The cook went to get a tomahawk.
But when he got the tomahawk, he saw that there
was trouble between Renati and Wini, and he
forgave Renati, for he had two wives of his own,
and was a man of experience and wisdom. Also,
his mother was dead many years.
“So he laid down the tomahawk, lit his pipe,
and waited to see Renati beat his wife. Renati
stood before her, and his wrath made his neck to
swell. ‘ I have returned ; woman, is it not plain
to you that I have returned ? ’ he said.
‘“lt is of no concern to me,’ she said, still
looking at the torn shirt of the pakeha which she
mended, and heeding not the tattered one which
Renati held close to her face, ‘if a blackfellow
who goes off after the women of his wife’s tribe
and leaves his wahine alone in the camp of the
stranger, has returned for a day or so.’ And she
went on singing the song of the laughing water.
“ The rage of Renati was terrible to see. He
could not speak, but he shook the tattered shirt
in the face of Wini, so that she could not see
where to put the stitches in that of Henare, the
pakeha.
“ She rose to her feet.
“ ‘ Pah ! ’ she said ; ‘ wash thy shirt, it is black
and of an ill odor, while this of the great white
chief is clean, and smells like the manuka, the
-manuka which covers the land with the white
blossom and sweet fragrance.’
“ He snatched the white man’s shirt from her
and cast it into the water, and the current bore it
away toward the fall.
“She said something in the Queen’s tongue, and
snatching the tattered shirt from Renati she threw
it as far as she could into the water. The current
bore it away, too. Renati seized her by the waist
and shoulder, for she was small though shapely
and of the beauty which the pakeha loves, and
hurled her into the water. The current gripped
her, and bore her away from the bank, and she
was swept over the fall, into the rainbow and so
down to Reinga.
“ The cook saw that the Taniwha had entered
into Renati, and he caught up his tomahawk and
fled into the bush and hid himself.
“Renati took a billhook, and fled swiftly up
the track that led to the station, and the cook
came back and made ready his kumeras for the
night’s dinner.
“Suddenly he heard a shout, and saw Henare,
the white man, running towards the river. He
ran so fast, that Renati, who leaped along behind
with the billhook raised ready to strike, could not
overtake him.
“The white man stopped on the edge of the
river, and turning to Renati said, ‘Where ’
“Renati struck him, but the heavy helmet
turned the blow aside, and the white man stepped
back to recover himself, slipped on the wet paapa
rock, and fell into the river.
“ Him, too, the current gripped fiercely, and
bore towards the centre ; but Henare was a strong
swimmer, and he battled with the tide till he saw
the uselessness of it. Then he swam towards the
other side, the cook shouting to him to swim
hard.
“Renati danced wildly, and shouted bad words
at him, and told him to go over the centre of the
fall, where he would find Wini waiting for him,
also the two shirts. And he tore his clothes from
himself and danced a haka, for joy at seeing the
white man in a hopeless case.
“ The tide ran strong, and it bore the scout
towards the fall, and he was but a little above
the cataract when he was only half way across.
He looked back hopelessly, and saw Renati
dancing his haka on the bank where he could see
him go over the fall.
“ A tree was racing down the river, top first.
Its great branches caught against the ridge that
makes the fall, and above which is a deep hole.
The tree, being caught, held for a moment before
the current swung it round and rolled it over the
fall sideways.
“The white man raised himself on the tree
and shook the water from his ears. Then he
looked at both banks and at Renati, who still
danced his haka, being a noisy fellow and without
dignity.
“Henare raised himself on the tree as the
current swung it round. It jerked and then
steadied for a moment, and Renati stopped his
haka that he might the better see the white man
go down to the pakeha’s Reinga ...
“The white man’s arm was pointed towards
Renati, there were three flashes from the tree,
and that black fellow sprang up into the air and
fell of a heap.
“The cook saw it all. He rushed to the bank
and shouted, ‘ Hail to thee, Henare ; thou art
indeed a great chief, and goest to a brave death ! ’
“ Even as he spoke the waters gripped the
tree, and Henare, diving from it, was caught in
the great swirl and carried over the cataract, into
the rainbow and out of the world.
“When the men came down from the day’s work
at the station they threw the body of Renati also
into the water, and he too was smashed to frag-
ments between the falling waters and the hard
rocks below.
“ Ouwei! It was a great trouble to make about
two old shirts.”

Westminster Abbey : The interior is magnifi-
cently simple; once you disregard the bad art of
many of the tombs. But the fog comes in here
also, and the dim religious light is too dim, and
the place, in winter anyhow, is smelly.
“ Wash it with a hose, the dirty, shabby Abbey,
Microbes in the chancel and corpses in the floor,
Tombs in tea-chest art, and sculptures weak and flabby,
And the fog—an atmospheric moss on groin and choir
and floor.”
An Englishman in Australia once told me that
no Australian would ever write good literature
until he had been to the Abbey for inspiration.
He also said something about “ the tradition of
the race,” but seeing that tradition is about 80
par cent, lie, and 10 per cent, faulty reporting
and 10 per cent, fact, the advice did not seem
much better than advice to take Titus Oates
for a model would be. The belief in all tradition
rests on the assumption that human nature has
suffered a weakening and impoverishment during
the last generation or two. Whereas, if it has
changed at all, it must have found betterment.
But the fact is, that for all vital purposes it is the
same as it was when Nero burned the Christians,
who, by the way, must have been a great nuisance
to the established order of things.
As for “ inspiration,” there is more in one dram
of sunshine than in a thousand tons of dead kings.
However, the worship of the dead is common in
England. It is governed by old men—very old
men; and a very old man is usually merely a dead
man, who insists on holding his breath.

The Savage Club : In the chair was the Chief
Justice of England, a fine stamp of a man, the
cultured John Bull, whom I thought until now
existed only as a sort of superstition. He sang
two songs—one, the Judge’s song from “ Trial by
Jury ” which, to the extent of his beginnings
only, might have been autobiographical; the
other that rollicking sea song with the swinging
chorus:
“ To the wind that blows,
And the ship that goes,
And the lass that loves a sailor.”
Imagine Madden, the Chief Justice of Victoria,
doffing his “ dignity ” to sing. It is impossible.
He knows that he keeps his dignity an unwilling
prisoner, and that it would escape altogether if
once let off the chain.

The Cheshire Cheese : Strangers from America,
Australia, India, Africa, and from the English
provinces make “pilgrimages” to this old haunt
of Doctor Johnson. It is a little low-down
house with little boxes in its eating-room, like the
drinking compartments at old Sammy Peck s
public-house in Hobart—that public-house which
is English in its drinking, and reminiscent of the
days of American whalers in the Tasman Sea, in
its name—the Alabama.
The proprietor and the visitors to the Cheshire
Cheese insist that the old ways of the 18t'i cen-
tury are here perpetuated because of their pic-
turesqueness, but the high prices charged for eat-
ing a microscopic steak, at a rough table, while
seated on a rude chair, placed on a floor covered
with sawdust, are proofs that the sawdust and the
roughness are retained because they are cheap,
and carpets and decoration cost money.
The waiter asked me “ if I would like to see the
doctor’s chair upstairs,” and I replied, for the
purpose of making him explain at great length his
obscure ideas of the insanitary dictionarian, that
I didn’t want to see any doctor’s chair, as I was
never ill.
“What!” said he. “ But it’s the great Doctor
Johnson, sir.”
“I don’t care who he is ; I don’t know him.”
“Know him, sir. Nobody knows him, sir—
he’s dead this hundereds o’ years, sir.
“ Well, then, what does he want with a chair?
“It’s the great Doctor Johnson, sir—great
writer, sir.” .
“Well, I don’t know anything about him. Can
you give me any fish ? ”
“No, sir; no fish here. Just what they had a
hundered years ago, sir. The House pudden ,
sir.”
“ What is it made of ? ”
“ Just what Doctor Johnson used to have, sir.
Very rich it is, sir.”
“ I’ll take a steak then.”
“Yes, sir. An’some beer, sir? An’ a leetle
cheese, sir? Real Chesher, sir. Jus what the
doctor used to have, sir.”
I broke the rules of the establishment by order-
ing Cheddar.
As I was eating, the waiter stood at my elbow
and told me all about Johnson. “That was his
seat, sir—the place is just the same as it was
then.”
“Now then,” said I, “it’s useless telling me
that. According to your own story, Johnson was
dead before Tasmania was settled.”
“Tasmania, sir?”
“Yes—Hobart. This place has been copied
from Sammy Peck’s public-house in Hobart.”
The waiter left me then.
In the next box were two young men making
the “pilgrimage,” going resolutely through the
Johnsonian programme. Their hearts may have
been in their work; their stomachs weren’t.
That rich pudding —of steak, kidney, larks,
oysters, and other things ; the heavy ale; the
Cheshire cheese, and the half-bottle of old port
were put in ’tween decks with a cheerful heroism
that discounted the difficulties ; but they found
their Waterloo in the heavy tobacco, smoked in
churchwarden clays “same as Doctor Johnson
used, sir.” They grew pale, and hurriedly writ-
ing their names in “ Doctor Johnson’s Book ” —a
register weighing about 301 b.—they walked out
looking as if they’d like to run.

’Tis a warning of Kidney Ills.
Backache is the Kidneys’ cry for help
the aches and pains of bad back—the
Lame Back—the Weak Back—all
tell of Kidneys sick from overwork.
Kidneys become blocked, con-
gested, inflamed.
They’re delicate little organs,
those kidneys of ours.
Weren’t intended to stand
the strain that Twentieth
Century hustle and bustle
puts on them. Most natural
thing in the world that they
should get out of order.
And when they do they
let us know about it mighty
quickly.
Send a sharp twinge in
the back to tell us of their
need for help. It’s a warn-
ing that had best be heeded.
Serious trouble ahead if it isn’t-
Backache is the beginning—the end is death, if the
warning is neglected.
No time should be wasted.
Go to their aid.
Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
Will start the Kidneys work-
ing rightly, relieve the back-
ache, heal the inflammation.
Remove the Backache, cure
every Kidney 111, cure Dia-
betes, and women’s disorders.
They are a little remedy that
help women to bear the bur-
dens of life more easily. Make
better, happier, more capable
women of them. Are doing it
right here in Sydney.
The best proof of this lies
in the evidence of people you
know, the evidence of friends
and neighbours.
SYDNEY PROOF.
Mrs. Burraston, 93 Abercrombie-streefc, Sydney, says :—“Three years ago, in
Armidale, T made a statement that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me of
kidney complaint, which had afflicted me for twenty years. I have used this
remedy since I made that statement—but very little. I am pleased to tell you
that lam still well, the medicine having worked a permanent cure in my case. I
was real bad before I got these pills. I had frightful pains in the small of my
back ; in fact, these pains were always bad. I could not well rise after bending,
and could not turn in my bed without crying out, it was so bad. I scarcely slept
at all, excepting on the most favorable occasions. I suffered with headaches, and
my sight was so dim I had to wear spectacles. My secretions were discolored,
and contained a gritty deposit. At the time I got Doan’s Pills I had become
hopeless of ever losing these troubles, and the effects when I used the medicine
were a most welcome surprise. The fourth dose gave me slight relief, and the
first box gave me increased energy. Not long after I was free of all pain and
headaches, and I slept splendidly every night. In fact, I was cured, and cured
to stay, as time has proved. These are grand Pills for the Kidneys.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by
all Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes,
l&s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price by Poster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.
BUT BE SURE THEY ARE DOAN S-
Eczema.
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any itchiness of the skin.
Piles almost drive' you crazy.
All day they make you miserable.
All night they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema.
Such miseries are daily decreasing.
People are learning they can be cured.
Learning the merits of Doan’s Ointment.
Plenty of proof that Doan’s Ointment will
cure Piles,
Eczema, or any irritation of the skin.
Read the testimony of a Sydney citizen :
Mrs. Peters, 15 Edward-street, Redfern,
says “ About two years ago I certified that
Doan’s Ointment had cured me of Eczema, of
five years’ standing. I am better able’ to
bear the statement out now than two years
ago, as the cure has been proven since then.
I’ve been free of the itch ever since; in fact,
perfectly cured. It used to be a burning itch
on the leg that was very hard to bear. In
hot weather it used to be terrible. I had a
good deal of treatment. I had it seen to by a
number of doctors, but it baffled them, and I
was also treated as an out-door patient at the
hospital, with no better result. I came to use
Doan’s Ointment by hearing so many people
speak of it as an excellent remedy for itching
skin trouble.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all diseases
of the skin, Eczema, Piles, Hives, Sores, In-
sect Bites, Chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe
and very effective. Very often two or three
pots have cured chronic cases where other
remedies have failed for years.
Doan’s Ointment is sold by all chemists and
storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per pot, or will be
posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan
Co., 7b Pitt-street, Sydney.

By the Sands of the Sea,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sails—and a Sea of Gold !
And my lover’s strong band I bold,
While my wild tears rise
As the daylight dies—
I fear for my lover with fears untold,
For he sails away
At the close of day
On that shimmering Sea of Gold.
Oh, treacherous Sea of Gold !
Sails—and a Sea of Green !
And I think of that parting scene,
As alone I stand
On the wind-blown strand
With my heart a-dread with foreboding keen.
For, though fondly he swore
To meet me once more
On the shore of this Sea of Green —
Thou’rt greedy, oh, Sea of Green !
Sails —and a Sea of Grey !
And a world to match, as I pray
’Neath the darkening sky
That my lover and I
May meet again on that golden day
When, all partings o’er,
We shall fear no more
That lonely, grim Sea of Grey.
Oh, desolate Sea of Grey !
Sails—and a Sea of Black !
And the winds work ruin and wrack.
Again I stand here
Witli a deadly fear—
“ Oh, love, my love, why com’st thou not back ? ’»
But my cry is lost
In the gale, and tossed
And mocked l>y that Sea of Black.
Oh, merciless Sea of Black !
Sails —and a Sea of Blue !
And the brown boats rise into view.
But I shrink from the sight,
For the waves, last night,
My lover they brought to me—dead, but true
To his tryst with me,
And he lay at my knee—
Oh God ! what a coming from out of the sea !
For ever and ever my curse rest on thee,
Thou calm, smiling Sea of Blue !
Oh, hypocrite Sea of Blue !
SYDNEY.
S. ELLIOTT NAPIER.
The Fall of the Dice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thebe was the man she was going to marry, and
there was the man she loved, and there was her-
self. Other people came into her world, but they
do not count here.
Just at this time she happened to be a lady-
help, and when she had carried the dinner things
out into the kitchen she went to the head of the
kitchen steps to meet the man she loved. He
generally came in the back way because it was the
shortest, and he generally helped her wash up
before he strolled into the front rooms, because
Everybody in the front rooms knew it—except
the man she was going to marry, and he was there
for the first time. She had been playing ping-
pong with him in the glare of the hot dining-
room. Now, out in the shadowed kitchen, she
was going to play a cruelly-hard game with the
Other Man.
Bert Barlow, passing the kitchen, saw the
Other Man on the steps, and grinned. For he
knew the ignorance of the man she was going to
marry. The Other Man called to Bert from the
door, and came in laughing. This evening was to
him just as all the rest were, and would be. But
she knew that it was the end of the beginning of
Life.
It was a hot, breathless night, with enough
moonlight across the kitchen to allow the gas-jet
to bum low and the corners where cups and dish-
towels hung to go out in darkness. The Other
Man put his arm round her shoulders in the
ordinary possessive way, and stooped to kiss her.
Without doubt he was good to look at, even in
the shadows ; but she slipped from him instantly.
A thing denied increases in value, and it was
her intention to awaken all the desire in him this
night.
“What’s that for? Don’t be a little sneak,
Jenny. You can keep that sort of thing for the
other fellows.”
There was enough anger in him to show that he
really cared.
“Look,” she said, dramatically, and spread
out her hands on the table before him.
She was not in the least pretty, but she had
that which the few women possessing it know
to be more powerful than beauty. It is usually
called devilment. He looked, knowing she had
practised that little backward poise before the
glass. But it pleased him, nevertheless.
Then he put hia hand over the spread ones,
and drew them nearer as he sat on the table-
edge,
“Well, little girl ?”
‘ ‘ Those pearls are my engagement ring. ”
He separated the fingers, chuckling content-
edly.
“That’s another of ’em, isn’t it? And that?
How many times have you been engaged since I
knew you, Jenny ? You keep the scalps, and let
the poor beggars go ”
“ I mean it this time.”
“Of course. You always do. Who is it,
then?”
“Jim—again. He—he’s here now.”
The Other Man whistled softly.
“The deuce he is ! I thought he belonged to
the back-country entirely. Never mind. You’ll
chuck him as you’ve chucked the lot of ’em, lock,
stock, and barrel. You must have your little
game, Jenny, but you’ve never cared for a man
yet—except me.”
She jerked away her hands and put them
behind her. The thumping of her heart un-
steadied her voice; for he spoke plain truth.
“ You don’t know that. It’s a ”.
“I do know that ! Come here, Jenny ”
“No!”
“Afraid of Jim, eh?” His eyebrows went up,
quizzically. “ He’ll be sitting on the edge of his
chair, turning over photograph albums, and
mopping his face when nobody’s looking. He’s
all safe. Besides, Bert shut the middle door. I
heard him.”
She would have played this game better if love
and fear had not blurred the moves.
“It is you who should be afraid of Jim. He’s
a good man, much better than you.”
“So he is. Very much better. That’s why
you love me. Come and tell me you love me,
Jenny.”
“ I’ll never tell you that any more, now. And
I’ll never let you kiss me.”
“Won’t you? Not when you know I’m want-
ing you so ? ” His tone was very tender, for he,
too, knew the value of practice.
“Jenny ! If you love me, dear?”
She came then, with the meek submission that
had won her much before this day. But then
she had played for sport.
The man she was going to marry was rich, and
grey as a bandicoot. Also, he would give her the
soul out of his body if she desired it, and it could
be found. And at the word of the Other Man
she would go with him to the end of life, caring
not at all what the morrow might bring. But he
had not said that word, and —because she loved
him—she did not know if he would ever say it.
The incoming tide talked to the sandy beach
across the road, and the tick of the clock was
oppressively loud. She moved, and he held her
closer.
“If Jim knew,” she whispered.
“ Who cares? Like his cheek to want all your
kisses himself ! ”
“You wouldn’t like it if —if you were he ! ”
“By George, no ! I should not.” The Other
Man laughed uneasily. “It’s his own fault. I
look after my possessions better than he does.”
Her pulses drummed in her ears, and she flung
him a challenge.
“Seems to me you prefer looking after his.”
“Perhaps I do. When they’re only his in
name.”
A damp dish-cloth on the wall had a fleering
face in the moonlight. Possibly it saw all the
cards in the game she was playing so blindly.
“I’ll be more than his in name—next month.”
“What?”
“ I am going to marry Jim next month.”
He drew back her head and looked at her
keenly.
“You can’t. You love me, not him.”
“ But I’m going to marry him. I mean it. I’m
going to marry him ! ”
This was the last throw, and she had staked
her soul on it. He half guessed, as their eyes
held each other silently. To Jenny there was
nothing in the swimming universe but those eyes
that met hers. If he cared! Oh, God! if he
cared—just a little !
His own sight was very clear, and presently he
reddened.
No one likes to feel that he deserves horse-
whipping ; and so the Power that made man of
sinful clay should undoubtedly take the blame.
Besides, they had both played with fire all their
lives, and if she had burnt her fingers at last, it
was surely only what she might have expected.
He dropped his eyes, and stood up with a sigh.
“Well, every girl thinks more of marriage than
of love, I suppose. Jim’s a good man, as you
justly observe, and he will make a very estimable
husband. I wish you all happiness, of course,
and—though you are going to be so cruel to me,
Jenny—you’ll give me another kiss for the sake of
the jolly times we used to have.”
She let him take the kisses, because the world
had come to an end, and nothing else mattered.
But she was numb under his touch. Then the
rattle of the piano reminded her. She straight-
ened her hair in the deft, quick way he knew so
well, and walked before him into the crowded
front rooms.
Being a woman, it was necessary that she should
so talk and laugh and sing that the Other Man
would never know that she had played with him
for the desire of her soul—and lost.
And (being a woman) no one ever did know.
Except the Other Man.
G. B. LANCASTER.
Thus “Kendrick” in the first class
smoker: —
Had a queer experience myself once. Wisdom tooth
pained like Sheol. Sunday morning. Called on a friend,
a half-caste Yankee, who was duly qualified and all that,
and a real good fellow to boot. He said he’d have him
out for a crown. I pulled out my pocket book and found
a Government cheque and sixpence. Douglas couldn’t
change the cheque, and said “ Don’t trouble ; it’ll be all
right.” His wife stood by to help, and he placed a cork
with a string attached between my teeth lengthwise. I
inhaled the gas, and by-and-bye knew he was feeling my
finger tips and afterwards he touche d the pupils of my
eyes. His wife and he were a hundred yards apart, and
shouting at each other like old boots. Something told
me they were going to go through me for the cheque. I
jumped from the chair, hit Douglas on the point and
knocked him down kicking into the corner, and banged
through a swinging green baize door, crushing Mrs.
Douglas’s hand in so doing. I got out in the street, ran
down the pavement among all the church-goers, hatless,
my nose bleeding, the blood dripping on my shirt-front,
and the cork still in my teeth. Just then the cork
dropped out. I struck an attitude and yelled “Thank
heaven I’m saved.” I looked across the street, saw Joe
Wells, and sang out “ Hold on, Joe, I want you for a wit-
ness to this,” and ran across the road. On stepping up
on the other side, there was no Joe there. I felt an awful
ass, walked back to Douglas, apologised to him and wife,
and drank a glass of wine that he had ready. Then some-
how we quarrelled again, and I killed both of them 'and
set the house on fire, and went home. Just then I heard
Douglas remarking that the tooth had come out pretty
easy, cons idering.
A Sydney man of high moral character
(call him Smith) got a shock the other day and
likewise gained a valuable insight into the work-
ings of the female mind even as exemplified in the
humble Mary Jane. He is the father of an un-
usually handsome child, whom his wife loves to
deck out in velvet and Fauntleroy curls, and
whom his Mary Jane, a large-mouthed person
with few attractions, is deputed to take for an
airing every morning. One day Smith was going
through Hyde Park with Brown, also a man of
unblemished character, when they saw Mary Jane
and Smith’s infant in the near distance. Imme-
diately Brown heaved a heavy sigh, and remarked
how sad it was that such a lovely child should bear
the brand of illegitimacy and that sinful man
should again have triumphed. Smith was naturally
upset at this aspersion cast on his offspring,
and further inquiries elicited the startling fact
that his Percival was known all through the
adjacent streets as Mary Jane’s misfortune, and
the son of an unknown person of great social
importance. Mary .Jane had yearnings, it
seemed, to be a species of London Journal
heroine. She had acquired a small local halo by
her supposed liaison with a man of rank, and was
not at all worried over the fact that she had
bought her halo by posing, to a certain extent, as
a lost person. The possibilities of great things
were in Mary Jane, but she departed from a
shocked household next morning, all the same.


A Weak Stomach
Indigestion, No Appetite, Exhaustion, General Weakness,—All Due
to a Sluggish Liver and Impure Blood.

Mr. G. A. Boxall, of Prahran, Vic-
toria, sends us his photograph and says:
“I wish to tell every one the great
help I received from Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. I suffered terribly from weak-
ness of the stomach, indigestion, and
biliousness, and I had no appetite. I
felt tired all the time. Sometimes it
seemed almost impossible for me to
keep about. But after using Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla for a short time for my
blood and as a general tonic to my
nervous system, and with an occasional
use of the Pills to keep my bowels in
good condition, I rapidly improved, and
am now enjoying better health than I
have in a long time. I now keep these
medicines near at hand and take just a
little whenever I begin to feel badly,
for, you know, ‘ a stitch in time saves
nine.’ ”
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Of course you cannot enjoy good health if your stomach gives out. You
must have an appetite, must digest your food, and must keep your liver
active. Muscular strength, nervous strength, desire to be active, and a feeling
of general good health may be yours by keeping your liver active and your
blood pure. It takes just two medicines for this: Ayer’s Pills for the liver
and Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for the blood.
It s Ayer’s Sarsaparilla you want. Insist upon getting “Ayer’s,” for it’s
stronger, contains more ingredients, and cures quicker than any other kind
AYER’S i arsaparilla
Strengthens the Stomach and Aids Digestion
Ayer’s Pills keep the liver in a healthy condition.

something good to tell, there is no need to delude the unwary
into reading an apparently interesting story, which proves
to be a prelude to an advertisement. The startling story
and the “thrilling” testimonial do not add to the merit of
the article advertised. If you are troubled with
BAD DIGESTION, IMPURE BLOOD, LANGUOR,

or other such ailments which arise from a Disordered
Stomach imperfectly doing its work, you need not
experiment with the many medicines so plausibly put

Rosalind was Peg Woffington’s favorite, and last, part.
She was speaking the epilogue to “ As You Like It,” at
Covent Garden Theatre in 1757, when paralysis struck
her dumb.
The good fortune of the late Max O’Rell lay in the fact
that he was a Frenchman domiciled in England, am
capable of producing books of intelligent comparati
criticism on a people who readily accepted the uncomp -
mentary parts thereof. No Englishman resident in Pa
could have made thousands of pounds by writing Jacques
Bonhmmne et La Belle France, gaily satirising tle
French. As a lecturer before English-speaking audienc
Max O’Rell seemed to owe all his success to his foreignnes
His accent gave point to his little jokes, which we
mostly of the smallest kind.
Adelaide Critic lately “corrected” somebody’s rem-
niscences of Essie Jenyns by stating that she made h
first appearance in 1886. As a matter of fact Ess
Jenyns made her first appearance, at Melb. Royal, aft
her return from England in December, ’B5. But befo
going to England with her mother and step-brother sh
had played minor parts, beinjf then a very young gir ,
and very promising. Present scribe remembers her in a i
least one of those early parts. She was a slavey, and sh
sat on a rocking chair and nursed a baby. There mus ;
have been something very natural and convincing abou i
Essie of the rocking chair, or she would not now be th s
scribe’s only recollection of the show in which she was
mere detail.
Years ago, when George Darrell (of all people 1) playec
Hamlet in Maoriland, and Oily Deering was a member o
the co., Oily doubled the parts of Polonius and the Firs ;
Gravedigger. His fruity voice proclaimed the identit
of the cemetery man the moment he spoke. He wa
obviously old Polonius back from the grave. One nigh ,
an irreverent person in the gallery greeted him, “So
you’ve dug yerself up, ’ave yer ! ’*
“ F.” : Pinero, by far the brightest English dramatis

Re identification of suspects. The usual procedure i
to place the alleged criminal among a gang of other pri
soners, from whom he or she has to be selected by
whoever is there for the purpose. The other day
theatrical gentleman was called upon to establish th
identity of a supposed cut-purse. At the door of th
prison he was met by a police-sergeant, who said to him
“ I suppose, Mr. X , you’ll be able to pick hin
out?” “ Certainly ; I know the man well.” “Of cours

Wilson Barrett had a very narrow escape at Mancheste
some time in April. By the mistake of a chemist
he was administered a strong dose of aconite in lieu of
prescription for cold. For several hours his life was
despaired of, but he recovered, and the tall Roman
boots and short Roman shirt of Claudian are not vacant
yet.
“ Melb.”: Dowie’s local “ Zion,” the Hibernian Hall, is
next door to the old County Court, scene of the libe
action between Tom Walker and Dowie. Dowie’s agent,
the energetic and vituperative Voliva, has taken the
Hibernian Hall with a view to doing Zion business on a
big scale. Dowie must have forwarded a large sum of
money. Voliva refuses to let any part of the hall for
other meetings, concerts, dances, or anything outside
the Dowie job.
“ Haresfoot ” : Apropos Daniel Frawley’s “ Secret
Service,” produced in Melb. There is another play of
that name, a short comedy, in which Daddy Rogers was
a favorite Australian exponent of Michel Perrin, a harm-
less old chap, in unmitigated distress through discovering
that he had been a tool of Pouch? 1 , in betraying his best
friends. Bouffe was the original representative in Paris,
and Barren in London. The “ Secret Service ”of Gillette
and Frawley is a kind of second edition of “ Held by the
Enemy.”
of Roumania has written a descriptive song
(in German), which tells of a starving weaver dying in
the attempt to work his shuttle. His son is at the wars
fighting for the king—God Bless him ; his daughter has
committed an illegitimate baby, asid his wife has gone
mad. Queen “ Carmen Sylva,” composing such songs of
misery in her royal boudoir, in between her ceremonious
meal_ times, strikes one as a beautiful exponent of
monarchical principles.
Previous to Edward Lloyd’s arrival in Australia, it was
stated in Williamson and Musgrove’s advt. circular that
" the great mass of his English admirers are especially
fond of ‘ Goodbye, Sweetheart, Goodbye. This they are
never tired of hearing.” He never sang it in Australia.
His voice was no longer capable of eharming effect in the
li&ht ballads with which his name had.been identified ©f
yore. W. and M. didn’t know what sort of Lloyd they
were importing.
Esau, the man-monkey, lately performing at London
Pavilion, is dead of pneumonia, the disease that threatens
all civilised apes. Esau, the story goes, was heavily
insured with the National Live Stock Insurance Co.,
though it is hardly likely that any co. would take a big
risk on the life of the hairy music-hall artist. Also, it is
stated that the cheque for Esau’s premium was written
by his own hand, and that he will be succeeded in public
esteem by another monkey, whose forte is billiards.
Ex-Rev. Ralph Brown, who died down south the other
day, was one of the first of the cranks to undertake a
world tour with nothing in his pocket. Of course, he
travelled on his tongue, and wound up with enough to
start him on his unfortunate career as a.land-boomster.
“ Tim ” : lie productions of Dickens’ adaptations in
Melbourne touched on by “ Haresfoot ” (B. 16/5/’O3), my
brightest recollection is of a lengthy howl founded on the
“ Old Curiosity Shop,” that I sat out at the old Poly-
technic (up Bourke-st.) in the year 2 or thereabouts.
Prices were Is., 6d. and 3d., and bulky D’Orsay Ogden was
Bill Sykes. D’Orsay was a vigorous roarer, and when he
yelled at his faithful dorg he frightened seven years'
growth out of that ill-used animal. D’Orsay’s wife was
Nancy. There were about 16 acts—D’Orsay’s own adapta-
tion. Curtain rose at 8.45 (or else 7.45) and descended
at 1.48 a.m. Sunday morning. There was no orchestra.
A London correspondent sends some particulars re
Australian variety performers in England. Charles
Faning, on arrival, secured some good engagements, but
was unfortunate enough to be laid up for a time. He

Florrie Ford is “ going big ” in more wavs than one—she

Alma Gt-rey a little better than well. Old “Johnny”

doing “ three-part turns.”
“Melb.": Albert Norman hates the villains. His
happy time was when he replaced Baker for awhile,
as the hero in “ The World.” Macreadv, Irving, and
Willard are examples of actors who did long and dreary
spells in the villainous. O. Smith, the Adelphi villain,
was one of the gentlest and most amiable men in
London, ever plaintively bewailing his lot. Baker,
when with Dampier, and for six years with Bland Holt,
groaned under the same affliction.
