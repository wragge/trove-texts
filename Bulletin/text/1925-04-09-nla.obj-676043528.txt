“Among My Own People”
They told me Henry Lawson was coming
to my town, and a day or two after his
arrival I wrote to him, not without some
hesitation, for I had not seen him for over
a quarter of a century and I did not know
how the applause of all Australia and other
fiarts of the world might have affected him.
lut I need not have worried, for the next
day the following letter reached me, written
in a very shaky hand, for he had been very
ill:
Pine Avenue, Leeton
(Damn the date).
Dear Mr. Graliame, —I was delighted to get your
note. I’ve had two other such already, and both
from farms—one from Mr. McCausland (1 have
written to him also). We all seem to be here —•
there’s Alee (Leslie) McGill, the brewer of soft tack ;
he’s another old Bourke mate: 1 go up for a chat
nearly every evening. We are just camping here
and my affairs are all mucked up just now; I’m
working like hell to get ’em straight, and waiting
to see what the Department is going to do with me.
Drop in any'day, and we’ll “get acquaint” again
and arrange for a long chat, either here or at your
place, and I’ll tell you the fates of the characters
mentioned in your note, as far as I know.
Yours sincerely, Henuy Lawson.
That evening I walked up the street in the
hope of meeting him, and saw him coming
down the hill, his broad-leafed liat turned up
at the back, and a small parcel under his
arm. Of course, I knew him at once; I
do not think anyone would fail to recognise
Lawsou after once seeing him. But what
surprised me was that he knew me when
we were yet ten yards apart. What a
hearty, silent handshake we had! And
great peering into faces and looking each
other up and down! Then he insisted I
must go with him to his bungalow and meet
the Little Landlady and “dog Charlie.” I
went, and soon we were all good friends.
Feverishly he ran me from room to room,
showing me the furniture he had made;
although rough, it was strong and service-
able, and his only tools were a saw and a
hammer—he had used the nails drawn from
the packing-eases from which he made the
things. And how proud he was of them
all—the dresser, linen-press and table! The
little cabinet that is now at my elbow was
amongst them. Standing on four short legs,
it has a recess wherein I store books, and
near the top is a semi-secret cavity, where
I keep old papers and such like—he chuckled
as he showed it to me, and described how
it would “just hold six” —he meant bottles.
Then we sat and talked far into the night,
and went over some of the old times again.
How full he was of bright hopes! He’d show
’em, he said, what his own people could do
for him. I think at the time he felt he was
a kind of, literary come-back. He made a
jinn that rather surprised me at the time.
We were discussing the house that w 7 as at
his disposal, and he considered it quite good
enough—too good, in fact, he said. When
I remarked: “Mr. Broatch’s house” (Broatch
was the then manager of the irrigation
areas) “would not bo too good for you.” he
replied: “We’ll broach the subject to ’em.”
A year later I heard him make another;
those were the only two T ever knew 7 him to
be guilty of.
It was a warm night, and when I was
leaving he said he’d walk part of the way
home with me. Although we did not talk
much, I don’t think I’ll ever forget that
walk. When we were parting, almost
at my gate, poor Lawson broke down —as
I said before, he’d been very ill, and his
nerves were in a rotten state. Wringing
my hand almost off the wrist, he said: “Good
night and God bless you—God bless us both.
We are Jim and Harry again now.” And
then he turned and almost ran off.
A few days after that Jack Sullivan, who
owned the local paper, offered him £2 10s.
each for two articles dealing with his (Law-
son’s) impressions of the place, and two fine
things they were. The first he headed
“Among My Own People.” Although both
were good they did not make much of a
stir. People didn’t have much time or in-
clination to read such things just then;
their literature consisted mostly of bills
overdue, or final notices, typed on stiff blue
paper.
As the weeks passed the color came back
to Lawson’s cheeks, and his step was lighter
and his elniclde heard oftener. One day
old Frank, the head groom, lent him a
saddle hack, Gipsy by name. Whether
Gipsy at that moment heard the call of the
wild, or whether Lawson did something to
annoy her, I don’t know; but she bolted
almost as soon as he was mounted. Past
my place at a full gallop they went. He
was sitting well back and pulling hard. I
followed on a bike, but as the mare was old
and pig-fat, she soon pulled up. As he dis-
mounted to greet me, he said: “I'm glad she
cleared out, Jim; it has shown me that my
nerve is as good as ever, and that I haven’t
forgotten how to ride.” Although his trous-
ers had worked up almost to his knees, and
be was a bit pale and shaky, I said nothing.
Then he felt like using an axe again. We
were both short of firewood, and the Water
Commission lent him a horse and dray to
cart some. What a day that was for him ! A
hit stiff and awkward at first, but after lie
“got his second wind” he was all right, and
worked faster than I could. He had not
forgotten the way to swing the Kelly. We
boiled the billy for dinner, resting it on
two small pieces of wood and building the
fire all round it. That pleased him im-
mensely; it was the right way, he said, the
buslnnan’s way; for he liked to feel that
he was of the bush again.
After we had given “Arrers” over to the
groom, we had tea at my place; and how
proud Henry was of his blisters and sun-
burn ! When we had finished the meal arid
had a smoke, he read the children’s hands.
This one “oughter be musical,” and that one
should write and so on. One of the younger
ones said: “What about your hand, Uncle
Harry? What docs it say?” “My hand!”
he said. “Oh. it says I oughter be dead.”
As I walked home with him that night we
passed a house where vehicles and horses
and bikes were drawn up all round. “What’s
on here?” he asked. I told him it was a
wedding, and, as I knew the people well,
we would go in if he cared to. “No,” he
answered firmly, and chuckled: “It’s too
late to save him, anyway.”
It was a While after, when the Little Land-
lady had gone away for a week or two, that
he decided to “batch” —cook, wash and “do”
for himself generally. We kept a watchful
eye on him, and for a few days everything
went off well. Then he’d forget to have
food in for breakfast, or the baker neglected
to leave the bread, or the cat or “dog
Charlie” stole the meat. He wavered and
finally capitulated, and crossed to the big
house over the road at meal-times. It was
noticed that he always gave the maid a coiu
as he was leaving. One of the family at
last took him aside to explain that the girl
didn’t expect a tip; like themselves, she was
pleased to see him there. Then followed
explanations and discomfiture for Lawson.
It was the home of a high official he had
slipped into; lie had thought all ulong it
was a boarding-ftbuse, and that he had been
paying the girl for the meal. But those
people were the big-hearted ones, and begged
him to continue coming. He beat a hasty
retreat, however, and I do not think he ever
went back.
As tile summer advanced I found him
changing a little, and his moods varied; one
day he’d be hilarious as a child, the next
he’d be down in the depths. It was these
moods that gave me the idea of the week-
end camps at the river; and as I had an old
horse, we pooled our cash and bought a
sulky. So began a long series of camping
and fishing excursions that were the means
of binding the old mnteship tighter than
ever.

Churches
There are greatly religious churches —
churches that awaken a religious feeling of
awe and wonder in man the moment he goes
into them. There are churches far more
ornate and rich that arouse about as much
religious feeling as a picture-theatre or town
hall. It is a matter of atmosphere. One
goes into St. Peter’s in Rome for instance,
with a guidebook in one’s hand, and one
comes out with the guidebook still in one’s
hand. But when one goes into Notre Dame,
in Paris, one whispers and feels inclined to
put the guidebook away. Notre Dame is
religious church. So is Westminster Abbey
But St. Peter’s in Rome is not. Neither is
St. Paul’s in London.
When a man climbs up a mountain side
to people watching below he becomes smaller
and smaller. This is a commonplace. But
like all other commonplaces this one, when
looked into, becomes strange. Yet stranger
by far is the fact that the man himself, as he
gets further and further away from the
watching people, becomes smaller anc
smaller to himself. He shrinks, as it were
inversely as the world looms larger anc
larger about him. Then it is that the gigan-
tic mystery of even the smallest things seems
to come nearer and nearer to him. He feels
the infinite. He becomes aware of what he
calls God.
When the prophets of old washed to com-
mune with God they climbed the mountains
or went out into the desert or the forest.
Then back amongst men they built teipples
wherein they sought to recreate wiiat they
had felt on the mountain or in the desert or
the forest. They would reproduce the solemn
majesty of Nature that had brought God to
them, and so bring God to their fellow men.
They cunningly imprisoned behind thick walls
desert and forest and mountain-top silence—
the silence one feels. They stored up the
sounds of vast winds rushing through vast
space, and with rows of columns and cun-
ningly constructed arches they suggested
limitless distances and limitless height.
Then with colored glasses—ruby and
blue in the main—they lit the shadows
with evening and morning light. So
they sought to get the atmosphere they had
known. So they sought to introduce the
people to the awesome, beautiful presence
they had found. They were, as are all
who live close to Nature, men of simple be-
liefs and tremendous faith. And the churches
they wrought were religious churches.
Amongst others the Gothic churches of
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are such
churches. But the possibly more magnificent
churches of the far more intellectual and,
consequently, far more sceptical Renaissance
age are not. Michelangelo was a mighty
genius, but he did not have the simple belief
and the great faith necessary in the true
church-builder. He did not put any religious
inspiration into the designing of St. Peter’s
in Rome. He did not go out into the desert,
or out to sea, or up into the mountains. He
did not tarry in places where the great
silences are. He only set out to outdo w’hat
other architects had done. He copied pillars,
not trees; window’s, not sunsets; organ
notes, not the w’ind. He would build a
grander, larger church than had ever been
built in the world before. And he did what
he set out to do. St. Peter’s is rich and
wonderful because Michelangelo W’as a genius.
But there are many • far more religious
churches in the w’orld that were designed by
men of whom the w’orld has never heard.
When we go into St. Peter’s we feel inclined
to say, “What a mighty genius the designer
of this must have been! How great is
man!” But when we enter the truly religi-
ous church we feel inclined to say, “How
small and humble all this makes one feel!
How mighty is God!”
It is much the same with St. Paul’s in
London as it is with St. Peter’s in Rome.
It lacks that which all the disfiguring monu-
ments with which Westminster Abbey is
packed cannot take away from that church.
St. Paul’s, like St. Peter’s, was designed by
an unbeliever. Sir Christopher Wren de-
signed palaces as well as churches. He put
himself into St. Paul’s as Michelangelo put
himself into St. Peter’s. He dedicated it
not to his God but to himself. Over his
grave in the crypt is inscribed, “Look around
for my monument.” One likes old Sir Chris-
topher Wren. And one loves St. Paul’s be-
cause Nelson and Wellington and Picton are

buried there in the grim cellar. And there
are those tattered flags. It is an inspiring
tomb. And it is ponderous as a tomb should
bo. It is not light and aspiring as a church
should be. It seems to bend one s thoughts
down towards those who lie beneath, its
immense columns seem to be pressing
into the earth beneath the weight of its
mighty dome. It is not like this in tru y
religious churches. They turn one ® thoughlit.
away from the earth. About the twelfth-century
Gothic Exeter Cathedral, for instance there
is an airy lightness. There is an everlasting
looking up. The graceful columns seem to
hold aloft the roof with the greatest ease.
They seem to stand like dances on tiptoe,
like flowers on windless days.
Many years ago men who were not geniuses
translated the Bible into English. 1 hey put
all the belief and reverence they felt in the
original into the English they used. They did
not work to show how clever they were or
how great they were. As they worked they
felt the greatness of their unquestioned be-
lief; they felt the smallness and humbleness
of themselves. The result is that the Eng-
lish Bible is a religious book. Thousands
of far more clever and far more intellectual
and possibly more understanding men have
attempted to improve on what these humble
believers did, and have failed. Notre Dame
and Westminster Abbey were designed by
men who felt God in the mountains and the
wind and the forests and the seas, and they
put these things into the great grey build-
ings to express the God they felt. St.
Peter’s and St. Paul's are to them as works
of art are to trees and flowers. Works of
art and trees and flowers are all beautiful
things and all necessary to the world in
which man dwells. But they are not the
same. _ __
ALAN D. MICKLE.
The Great Elchee
In the recently-published “Kings of
Arabia,” by Colonel Harold F. Jacob, Sir
John Malcolm, the “Great Elchee,” is held
to a passing censure for not bargaining with
the Sublime Porte, on a very liberal offer
made by the latter, for the British occupa-
tion of Aden as far back as 1827. Aden
was not acquired by the British till the pass-
ing of another decade, and was the first
conquest made by them after the accession
of Queen Victoria. The riiention of Malcolm
in this connection recalls the memory of a
great personality who united in himself to
a remarkable degree the qualities of a
scholar, a descriptive and historical writer, a
distinguished soldier, and a shrewd diploma-
tist. In some respects be resembled our
own Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, who
was not only a brilliant soldier, author,
scholar, translator, scientific inventor, accom-
plished surveyor and cartographer, but one
of the greatest explorers of Australia on the
“Golden Roll.”
I made my acquaintance with the writings
of Sir John Malcolm over 40 years ago when
I fished his “Sketches of Persia” and his
“Life of Clive” out of the tool-chest at a
timber-camp on the Murray. There were not
many books to be had, and “Clive” and
“Persia” were read through more than once.
His other books (a “History of Persia,” a
“Memoir of Central India,” a “Political His-
tory of India from 1784 to 1823,” and some
translations from the poets of Persia) were
for the skimming of after years. The cream
of his output is, however, to be found in
“Sketches of Persia.” Like Mitchell, who
hailed from Stirlingshire, he was a Scot;
but an Eskdale Scot. He was born in May,
1769, the fourth of ten sons of a small laird,
who had also seven daughters and was so
honest that he never offered a nag for sale
without furnishing the prospective purchaser
with a catalogue of its faults and failings.
Needless to say, his family had often to eat
their porridge without salt. The future
Governor of Bombay had to do his chores
like the other boys and girls of the brood,
and had little time for schooling. But, being
a quick and apprehending youngster, he
conned lr's lessons as he trudged backwards
and forwards to Wester kirk, where he re-
ceived his primary instruction and where he
was so prankishly inclined that “Jock’s at
the bottom of it” became his label for mis-
chief. When, as Governor of Bombay, he
srnt his old schoolmaster the anonymously
published “Sketches of Persia,” he intimated
on the fly-leaf “Jock’s at the bottom of it!”
When still very young he was, through
t' influence .of friends of his father, sent
to London to enter the East India Company’s
service. His first commission was signed in
October, 1781; his age was 12 years and
6 months! When 14 he was sent
to India as a cadet in the Madras army, and
applied himself with immense gusto to the
study of Oriental languages, especially of
Persian. When he was about 30 “John
Company” began preparations for the renewal
of the war against Tippoo Sahib, the Sultan of
Mysore, and the son of the notorious Hyder
Ali. This was Captain Malcolm’s oppor-
tunity :he w r as then assistant to the British
Resident at Hyderabad. The war terminated
with the complete conquest of Mysore, and
the death of Tippoo, who fell bravely fight-
ing on the ramparts of his capital of Sering-
apatam, in the siege of which city Captain
Malcolm greatly distinguished himself.
On the conclusion of the war against
Tippoo, Malcolm was sent on a mission to
the Court of Persia, to disengage that coun-
try from an alliance with Napoleon, to
establish political and commercial treaties,
and to induce the Shall to make a diversion
in Cabul for the relief of India from danger
of attack from Afghanistan. Malcolm was
splendidly qualified for his mission. He was
a student of Persian literature and an adept
in the spoken usage of the Persian tongue.
Though still in his early and vigorous man-
hood, he had spent 17 years in the
Orient. A master of civil affairs and admin-
istrative functions, no less than a brilliant
soldier, he had studied the Eastern mind and
the Eastern character, until he understood
every fold and wrinkle of its cryptic and
subtle complexity—and his mission had at
the time a brilliant success. The “Great
Elchee” made other visits after this (in 1802
and 1803 and again in 1810), and he recorded
,his impressions in the “Sketches of Persia.”
/which was not, however, published until a
quarter of a century afterwards. This book
[is a delightful accompaniment to the “Hajji
;Baba” adventure-novels of James J. Morier.
It is a guide to the topography of Persia,
recounts its tales and folklore, its fables
and apologues, its laws and customs, the
sports of hunting and hawking. It retells
in a new fashion anecdotes of dead kings
and sages, particularising the mighty Haroon-
oor-Rasheed; examines the P9etry of h ir-
dousee and Hafiz, with illuminative trans-
lations: and concludes with observations on
the intrusion of Russia. Its pages are magi-
cal with names of romantic sonorousness —
Persepolis, Shiraz, Khorassan and Isfahan—
and it should be read in conjunction with
the “Thousand and One Nights.”
In 1812, after his fourth visit to Persia.
Malcolm went to England, from which he had
been absent for about 30 years, with
the titles of Khan and Sepahdar of the
Empire, and wearing the order of the Sun
and Lion bestowed on him by the Shah of
Persia. He returned to India as Sir John
Malcolm to serve as the Governor-General s
Political Agent in the Deccan, with the rank
of a Brigadier-General. In 1815 lie pub-
lished his “History of Persia”—which, with
his other valuable works, is still regarded as
authoritative. .
As an instance of the keenness with which
the “Great Eleheo” listened to the opinions
floating around him, if he considered them
pregnant enough to be worth recording
take the following :
Abdulla is a man in whose company I take great
pleasure. His understanding is vigorous and strong,
and he has sufficient knowledge oi the English
character to speak his sentiments with freedom and
confidence... .Speaking of Turkey, he said that he
had no idea of its having the power to resist the
slightest attack, and lie believed, if left alone, it
would soon fall to pieces of itself. “I am myself a
Turk, and know my countrymen well. From the
Grand Signor to the lowest peasant in the empire,
they are alike devoid of public virtue and patriotism :
and that spirit of religion, which has long been the
only bond of union that has kept this unwieldy
State together, is every day becoming fainter ; and
while the Wahabees are making converts of the
inhabitants of Arabia and Syria, the provinces of
Turkey in Europe are relaxing from their religious
zeal, and becoming every day more ripe for the rule
of those Christian nations under whose power they
must soon fall.”
In 1822, aged 53, Malcolm returned to
England, and during the year following pub-
lished his “Memoir of Central India.” and
(in 1826) a “Political History of India from
17M to 1823.” In 1827 he was appointed
Governor of Bombay, and it was whilst hold-
ing this office that the “Sketches of Persia”
appeared in 1828. In 1830 he left India,
having served his country for half a century
in the East, and died at Windsor of paraly-
sis, in May, 1833. peed 64.

What Is Ahead of Man?
“A Country Doctor" must be suffering
severely from loss of sleep and a bad liver
—both consequent, I suspect, upon difficult
obstetrical practice—when he proceeds to
answer his own question as to “What Is
Ahead of Man”- (R.P., 12/3/25). Our
evolution he designates as “retrograde,
while admitting the vast and ever-increasing
development of the human brain. Our civili-
sation he calls “a process of degeneration,"
while indicating the increasing, perfection of
the instrument —the aforesaid brain —by
w*hich civilisation is advanced and main-
tained. In the degeneration of a few organs,
whose use we are rapidly out-growing and
upon which we no longer depend to the ex-
tent our ancestors did, he foresees the ulti-
mate decrepitude of the race. Man, after a
long period of development and a glorious
but momentary prime, is to be wdiceled oft
the earth in an invalid chair, a toothless, en-
feebled victim of racial senility !
Is “A Country Doctor” serious?
Can he not see in the disorders he men-
tions Nature's method of adapting us to our
rapidly-changing environment, by supplying
what is necessary and eliminating what is
useless? Of what use is a long vision or a
keen sense of smell and taste to the average
twentieth-century man? Our ancestors found
it as necessary to be able to see the distant
enemy or smell the distant quarry as we
find it to be able to read news-sheets and
sign cheques. What, moreover, could be a
more horrible burden to a city or flat-dweller
than a keen and insistent olfactory appara-
tus? And who wants to taste cook’s hands
in the scones or mingle the flavor of the
knife-polisli with the morning chop? What
man who undergoes the daily misery of shav-
ing and the weekly boredom of the hair-cut
will deplore the increasing sparsity of our
supply of hair?
Glasses are used to-day as often to correct
long vision (e.g., in presbyopia) as to im-
prove short-sightedness; and is not our in-
creasing use of near vision as likely to pro-
duce a usefully short-sighted race as it is
to produce a “totally blind” one? The preva-
lence of constipation is due almost entirely
to an ignorance (as to diet, hygienic habits,
etc.) which can easily be removed by a
little education. The Americans, in a few
decades, have been transformed from what
was probably the most into, apparently, the
least constipated nation on earth. While
most doctors lead sedentary .lives, I have
never met a constipated one, or one who
lived on cascara.
The physical well-being of the future race
can be left safely to an inventive and scien-
tific genius which has not yet reached its
zenith. “The peripatetic mass of brain
matter sans teeth,” etc., would be too futile
a curtain for the Dramatist who conceived
us!
J. R. G.
“Kodak”
“Kodak"’ has gone; and paradise will
be brightened by his gift of humor. I can
see him introducing the great Crayfish joke
to Peter; and Peter 'will chuckle so much
over it that he will hold the gate wide open
for a long queue of sinners. I doubt whether
there are boarders in Elysium, or dull sub-
urbanites, or pompous bishops, or blithering
drunks. But even if these legitimate causes
of laughter are barred by the civic ordi-
nances in Paradise, “Kodak” will find humor
even in angels, and there will be a titter
through eternity in which the cherubim
will join.
Humor, how rare it must be in Paradise,
and how precious it is on earth! And when
a real humorist is born the stars should
sing in their courses. In all probability
they do. Certainly when Ernest O’Ferrall
was born the stars danced, and now are
still.
Life is a serious business at best; but
the bleak expanses of humanity’s journey on
this earth are, here and there, at long-
intervals, livened by the genius of genuine
laughter. Those tiny oases are to be trea-
sured, so few they are. Our thoughts, our
feelings, our happinesses and our griefs pro-
vide the genuine humorist with the materials
of laughter. In the dulness and greyness
of our brief lives he discovers the sense of the
comic. “Kodak” was such a humorist. But
not a great humorist. He specialised in one
brand. He was not cosmic. He took for
his province the world of the suburbs and
the middle-class that stumbles through life
without much knowledge of it or how to
make the best of it. It was this congenital
narrowing of his humor to one class and
one brand that limited his appeal, not in
Australia, but in the wider world outside,
the world that finds humor in a banana but
knows not the subtle comedy of the cray.
A drunk is a drunk all the world over,
save in the United States; but “Kodak’s”
drunks were a specialised and definitely Aus-
tralian class.
The secret of his humor lay in the fact
that he did not look down from a bleak
aloofness at his subjects. He belonged to
Ids boarders; be was one. of us—a member
of the universal family of suburbanites. He
did not himself take home a lobster, but
lie sympathised with that generous though
alcoholic action, and he had aln almost
tender compassion for the cray. He was,
until his happy m§rr|age. a full-blooded
Rodger. And it was this soul-sympathy
with all the Rodgers of the suburban world
that made him the subtle interpreter of that
inarticulate class.
The popular conception of a humorist is
one always merry and bright, bubbling over
with gaiety, flinging out uproarious quips
in genial company, leading the merriment
at its loudest. “Rad,” as his heaps of
friends knew him. was at heart a melancholy
man, though the kindest of human souls.
Like Mark Twain, he was serious. His
frail physique, while physically against him,
made him the humorist he undoubtedly was.
From bis melancholy lie fished up subtle
humor with a shy smile, and it was not
he who laughed. He was content to let
the world do that. Yet who can say that
lie found no joy in life? Like Jack Point,
lie wore his melancholy behind his mask.
The gentlest, kindliest, most genuine fellow
in the world !
After all, says the crass public, what use
is a humorist? He makes us laugh, but
a laugh is soon spent and leaves no echo.
He does not make two perambulators where
there was only one perambulator before; he
does not turn' out sausages upon which the
world is nourished; he does not sit on Royal
Commissions, though the world would feel
better if he did : he does not become even
an alderman. He merely slips through life
leaving a trail of laughter as he goes. So
at the funeral of “Kodak” there were no
wreaths from the City Council or the Millions
Club or any of the other official or semi-
official bodies that renresent the community.
He passed from the life he had so enlivened
without any recognition from anybody in
narticular. After all. he was only a humor-
ist. After all, he was only that precious
gift that is occasionally given to our dull
humanity, a man who makes a continent
laugh. Gathered at his graveside there
were only personal friends and relations
and brothers of the pen. Journalists all,
and all had loved this gentle soul, and knew
he had served the community better than
many a Prime Minister.

A Satchel of Books
Sunken Gold, by Andre Savignon (Harrap). A
translation of a French novel of adventure which has
had a wide circulation among the youth of its native
land. The translation is by Edgar Jepson, some-
thing of an expert himself in this class of stoirv-
building. A vessel is fitted out to recover cargo
from sunken vessels on the coast of Brittany. The
story is told by a lad who was one of the crew, and
is replete with incidents and accessories of mystery
and imagination.
The. Thundering Herd, by Zane Grey (Harper;
Robertson and Mullens). All the traveller sees of
the Indian to-day is a derelict in tattered raiment
lounging at the “dgp6t” of some railway that cuts
through the prairie lands. This volume, which has
all the vim and love interest of its predecessors, con-
centrates upon the hunting of the buffalo. It takes
its readers back to the ’seventies, and gives a graphic
picture of life when “the rewards of buffalo hunting
were great enough to fire the blood of any. young
man.” ft is a bracing story, with the winds of
Heaven blowing through it.
Rogues and Diamonds, by Selwyn Jepson (Harrap).
“David Shaw Gould, sitting on the bench by Water-
loo Bridge, was cold.” It was the seventh night he
had sat on the same bench, and he was hungry. ine
police are seeking him for murder, of which he is
not guilty, and altogether David is in a corner. He
falls in with, a fat, bad man, and is by him intro-
duced to a Professor who is employed in the produc-
tion of synthetic diamonds. Follow intrigue, a
woman, a Dutchman from the African goldfields, anil
others to make an exciting plot.
Influencing Monica, by Lewese Maley (Ouselcy:
and Robertson and Mullens). “Fathers fust make use
of their children from the time they can open a
o-ate or drive a cow from the yard. They seem to
consider them implements essential to their indus-
try They feed and clothe them fov the same reason
that they oil and keep in order their metal imple-
ments.” ' This is the note of revolt in the Hves of
two daughters of a dairy-farmer, and out of it they
formulate a creed, one of whose articles is a deter-
mination not to marry no matter what comes along;
they refuse to bear children to be life-long drudges
on ’ a farm and slaves of the cow. How Monica,
the leading lady of this dairy-farm novel, was in-
fluenced by male wiles to renounce her creed con-
stitutes its romantic interest. The story is one with
a purpose • it has a fragmentary plot, and no atmo-
sphere. Its action is supposed to take place in
Victoria, but for the bare mention of this fact, it
might as well be cast in Devon or on the Veldt. Ihe
dialogue at times moves with creaking joints and
art fails to conceal itself.
Knocking About, by Augustus Baker Peirce (Vale
University Press). Harvard and Yale are to the
U.S.A. what Oxford and Cambridge are to England,
yet it is not conceivable that such a work as this
could have been published by either ot the latter.
It is a rough and ready record ot some of the
author’s adventures in Australia, embellished by
crude illustrations from his pencil. His claim to
academic distinction appears to be that he ( was a
good raconteur of stories, an excellent munic, clever
in legerdemain” and “a constant joy to the children.
The cost of publication was defrayed out of a
memorial fund, ft is fairly certain no commercially
minded private publisher in Australia would ha\c
taken the risk, though the book’s contents are wholly
devoted to our country. Straggling, disconnected,
and without form as it is, it yet gives an ente -
taining picture of life in Victoria and N. S. V alls
in the ’seventies and ’eighties. Probably the best
passages in the book are those describing the once
busy traffic by steamer on the Murray, a phase
of 'colonial life now almost forgotten; but the*,
are grave doubts whether even here the authors
memory has not played tricks with his pen.

Owners enthusiastically proclaim the Packard Straight-Eight,"the great-
est car in the world.”
In luxury of performance and supreme smartness of equipment and
finish there is certainly nothing to compare with it.
From the principle of Straight-Eight motor design come a speed-capa-
city, an ability of acceleration, an absence of gear shifting, that lift this
famous Packard far above its contemporaries.
The almost limitless reserve of silent, vibrationless power; the incom-
parable riding ease ; the safety, simplicity and ease of operation of Pack-
ard four-wheel brakes; the brilliant finish and sweeping grace are some
of the Straight-Eight qualities that particularly inspire enthusiasm.
The Packard Single-Six embodies perfectly the ideal of a quality car
that is—light in weight—economical to maintain—powerful—easy-
riding and moderately priced.
The long, low, sweeping lines are inimitably Packard. Riding comfort
is ensured by an exceptional spring length and long wheelbase. Aus-
tralian owners are getting from 16 to 20 miles and even more to the
gallon of petrol; 8,000 to 12,000 miles to a set of tyres ; 500 to 800 miles
or more to a gallon of oil, and, with all this, experiencing a comparative
freedom from adjustments and repairs that is a revelation.
The Single-Six enclosed models are the very essence of comfort and
convenience in motoring. They are upholstered in heavy grey-blue broad-
cloth attractively pleated. The cushions are wide and deep with luxurious
springs. All the enclosed models are equipped with a beautiful vanity
case and smoking set of Packard design. The quality and workmanship
of Single-Six enclosed models is of the same superlative standard that
Packard has always built into its enclosed cars.
The present price reduction of £3OO enables us to offer you all the com-
forts and luxuries of these enclosed cars at a price almost equivalent to
that of open models.

The Silver Migrants.
In every coastal hamlet.
Where fishing-folk abide,
Who watch by night and ramming
The ways of wind and tide,
Who know the green sea highways
Where silver migrants fare.
Bronzed men are up and doing,
Good news is on the air.
From bay, lagoon and river,
Where late their shoals abode,
By ancient habit driven
Along an ancient road,
Sea mullet, silver mullet,
Host after shining host,
By beach and reef and headland
Are moving up the coast.
Upon their cool green highway
They journey, undeterred
By jewfish and by kingfish,
By shark and (living bird;
Upon their path of peril,
By hungry foes pursued,
They journey ever northward,
4 flashing multitude.
Beneath high lighthouse lanterns
That shed white beams afar,
By shoal and lonely islet,
By dune and sandy bar.
O’er sunken rock and beaches,
O’er seaweed and sea-grass,
No pause a moment making
The silver migrants pass.
With boat and net made ready.
From dawn till day grows late,
With eyes upon the waters,
Keen-eyed brown watc hers wait;
For though swift shark and gannet
Feast red on shoal and shoal,
Man counts them as his harvest
And takes his royal toll.
From bay, lagoon and river,
In hordes they issue forth,
Sea mullet, silver mullet,
Upon their journey north.
Pursued by sharks and kingfish,
Waylaid by birds and men,
Sea mullet, silver mullet,
Are on the run again.

Love, if your eyes were not so strange,
So haunting their inconstant hue
I’liat changes, as sea-colors change,
* Prom grey to green, from green to blue;
If in their depths they did not hold
Green darkness of the shadowed sea
And sunken gleams of pirate gold
Below their deep serenity;
And if they did not sometimes seem
Mere grey than winter's misted rain
Or blue, like dusk, only to gleam.
Not blue nor grey, but green again—
I might forget you ; but so long
As in the grey sea's depths of blue
Green shadows waver and grow strong,
Love, love, I must remember you!

The Queen’s Room.
All yellow were the curtains of her room—
Only the prie Dieu was of leafy green—
Of yellow wood the tall and carven chairs,
With ebony and ivory studs between.
And ’broidered on the curtains was a stag,
Golden, his antlers like a branch of flame ;
And orange hounds that trailed him o’er the
wold
Even as envy muttered on her name.
Pale yellow was the long robe of the Queen,
As primrose petals blowing by a wood :
Her cincture was of gold, while emeralds
In frozen pools between the bright links
stood.
Most yellow was the moon above the lake
When the red deer stamped in the silver
glade:
And in the dusk the ivory of her brow
Against the green of her prie Dieu was
laid.
Yet she was listening through her flooding
hair —
As ears might listen on a headsman's
block
Before the axe has fallen —for the sound
Of one dull key set in a sullen lock.
All vellow were the curtains of her room.
All yellow was the moon above the tide.
The yellow door has opened to the King.
“Mary, have pity!” Thus the great Queen
cried!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Influence.
All the unmeasured universe of time
Is patterned with the paths of travelling
souls;
And the eternal infinite controls
The intricate design. No pantomime
Of mummers setting forth a drab display
Of imitated life, no shadow-show
Whereof the end is seen in the same glow
That lightens the beginning, no fair day
Whereof the morning and the night are
known
Can simulate this pattern woven through
With loosened fringes of Eternity.
There is no single road that winds alone.
What man but held to other hands, and
grew?
And some are wholly bond, and none are free.

LAME DUCKS FROM OVERSEAS.
Judge Bevan recently had before him, at
Yass (N.S.W.), two criminals named
Miller and Yeajs, whom he sentenced to
five years’ penal, servitude; and his remark
that the importation of persons of low type
was a matter of grave concern, and he could
wish it was receiving due attention, points
a suggestion made some time ago that an
Australian Medical Service should be insti-
tuted in England. Naturally English doctors
are more concerned in getting rid of un-
desirables thafi in safeguarding “the
Colonies.” The medical certificate in use
by them is, it is admitted, fairly comprehen-
sive. It requires the doctor to state the
condition of heart, lungs, teeth, digestion,
hearing, sight, (physique, sikin, efic., and
requires a statement as to whether or not
the applicant has ever been treated for
tuberculosis, mental or nervous trouble or
epilepsy, and whether he shows any signs
of disease of the genito-urinary organs. He
is then required to certify that the applicant
is, or is not, of sound constitution and fit
to earn Iris living. Then follows a declara-
tion to be signed by the applicant to the
effect that all lie has told the doctor is true,
so in effect the “medical’’ certificate is at
some points merely a certificate by the doctor
that the applicant has declared himself to
be free of insanity, epilepsy, etc. For the
doctor to have satisfied himself on all points
he would need to have gone thoroughly into
the applicant’s medical and family history,
and to have taken the trouble to verify
statements. He would need to have made
psychological tests, as mental or moral dis-
ability is often an elusive thing, not obvious
even to the trained observer without special
investigation. Including the necessary physi-
cal examination, all this would take at least
an hour for each applicant—and it would be
quick work at that. Furthermore, it is no
proof that a person is not suffering from
v.d. because he shows no objective “signs”
of genito-urinary disease; a Wassermann
blood-test for syphilis and a bacteriological
examination for gonorrhoea are necessary.
Listening through a stethoscope to a per-
son’s lungs is not sufficient to enable a doctor
to say with certainty that a patient is not
phthisical; the sputum must be examined.
Now, the Wassermann test alone will not
he made in England—even by the Board of
Health—for less than a guinea; if done
privately it will cost several guineas. The
cost of examining sputum and gonorrhoeal
“smears” is in the same neighborhood. It
is safe to say that none of these examina-
tions is ever done, and that no mental tests
are made, first, because they are not speci-
fied, and, second, because the amount paid
the doctor is 10s (id. for each applicant!
* * •
There are two points in relation to this
pretence at a medical examination which
are of particular interest to Australians. In
the first place, in the annual reports issued
by the English Board of Health in refer-
ence to the v.d. clinics, attention is invariably
drawn to the large number of patients—
sometimes two-thirds —who disappear with-
out concluding treatment, i.e., before they
can be guaranteed non-infectious. In the
absence of Wassermann and bacteriological
tests, who shall say how many of them “dis-
appear” into Australia? We should follow
the example of Canada and the U.S.A. in
deporting any immigrant found to be an
undesirable citizen within five years of his
arrival. Our limit is six weeks, and it
applies only to certain cases. The second
point is quite as disturbing. When war pen-
sions were being allotted, attention was
drawn by Sir Frederick Milner to the
astounding fact that pensions claimed on
the ground of mental instability were refused
to many claimants because their mental
incapacity dated from prior to the war,
although it was proved that the claimants
had stated their instability to the examining
doctor, and had in many cases brought certi-
ficates from the mental hospitals in which
they had been treated. It was claimed that
the doctors employed by the War Office
were responsible, and grave charges of in-
capacity were laid against them. Granting
that the doctors were merely incompetent,
the question arises: Are any of these doctors
who could not detect mental instability
even when pointed out to them by the
patients themselves, and who would be less
likely to detect it in the case of an appli-
cant for migration who naturally would
try to conceal his disability—are any of
these doctors employed to examine migrants
to the “colonies”? Is the doctor who declared
Puddifoot, for example, to be a fit and
proper person to earn his living (in Aus-
tralia!) still on the medical roster, and
presumably passing other Puddifoots to
assault helpless children, destroy life and
property and put the State to the expense
of criminal trials, etc.? Color is lent to
the suspicions by the fact that, for one
thing, Australia House recruits its migrants
from the unemployment bureaus, and an
applicant for unemployment relief who re-
fuses to apply for a passage has been kno'vn
to be threatened with having his dole dis-
continued. Also by the fact that, despite
Percy Hunter’s pained denials and Joseph
Cook’s “explanations.” circulars dated July
28, 1923, were issued to the poorhouses in
England, setting out that Australia House
and the British Government jointly would
lend the Poor-Law Guardians £ll toward
the passage of any adult pauper if the guar-
dians would pay the rest of his passage
(£ll) —always provided, of course, that
the pauper was acceptable to Australia
House. It is highly improbable that he
would not be acceptable, seeing that he
would he examined by an English doctor.
* * * *
The first step toward remedy is a recogni-
tion by the people of Australia that the
post of Director of Migration is by far the
most responsible position held in England
by any Australian —far more important than
that of any of the Agents-General or even of
the High Commissioner. The individual
holding it should be possessed of sufficient
dignity and strength of character to be
above political or social patronage. He
should appoint his own staff and not be
hampered by promoted politicians whose,
value to their country is, at best, equivalent
to the value of the brass-work to a ship.
The second step is the institution of an Aus-
tralian Medical Service in England staffed
by Australian doctors with Australian ideals
and a knowledge of the conditions to which
the migrant is coming, and responsible only
to the Australian Government. Then the
doctor responsible for sending us. a Miller
or a' Year could be dealt with. The Aus-
tralian Medical Service could and should
have its own laboratory in which all the
necessary blood and bacteriological tests
could be done, and an examination for
v.d. and psychological tests should be
compulsory in every case. The third
step is obvious to all but the Immigra-
tion authorities in the several States. It is
reorganisation of the arrangements for the
reception, absorption into the community
and employment of immigrants. Then we
would be in a position to attract the best
type of migrant and the skilled workers at
present going in thousands to the U.S.A. —
which, despite the quota system, and the
fact that migrants pay their own passages
without assistance, is attracting the best of
the people migrating from Britain. It is
true, of course, that an Australian Medical
Service would be expensive. But what of
the saving if we could eliminate the Puddi-
foots. Millers and Years we import at
present? Has anyone any idea of the num-
ber of people of other than Australian birth
whom Australia supports—or partially sup-
ports—in mental and general hospitals, t.b.
sanitaria, gaols. State charitable institu-
tions. etc., or of the number of such persons
who come before the police courts? Of the
number of immigrants and immigrants’
children who are a charge on the community
in homes for the mentally defective, or in
homes for “fallen women,” or who, worse
still, are at large in society? Of the num-
bers not Australian treated, at great expense
to the State, in v.d. clinics? No one can
know these things, because the figures have
never been comniled.
THE BRICKS OF BEDLAM.
Anybody who has doubts about the authen-
ticity of that recent cable reporting the
trial at Moscow of members of a religious
sect who preach and practise the interesting
faith that, because Adam and Eve never
married, children born in wedlock are unholy
and must be killed, are referred to Ferdi-
nand Ossendowski’s “The Shadow of the
Gloomy East” for confirmation. Ossen-
dowski knows Russia’s cradle, which is
nearer Tartary than Europe, well, lie spent
many years in the home of Jengiiiz Khan
and wrote two strange books about it; he
shared in exile to Siberia the usual fate of
the Polish intelligentsia under the Czars,
and lie held many high positions in the
Russia of pre-Bolshevik days. It is not of
the madhouse built by the amiable Lenin
that he writes, but of its foundations
in the soul of Russia. That soul was
never more than half European, and early
in its development the dark shadow of the
immemorial East closed over it and quenched
the meagre gleam of Byzantine Christianity,
itself an Oriental rushlight. And so, as
in most'of Asia, the unit of Russian society
remains the village commune and the basis
of the commune’s creed is pagan.
Although a priest, as illiterate as them-
selves, is present in every Russian village to
represent the Christian creed, it is to the
terrible old Siberian god Perkimas the
villagers turn in times of stress; and it is
to the shaman, the custodian of a still earlier
aboriginal faith, they apply in their daily
troubles with the milkehurn and the flail.
The descendants of the wizards, exorcisers
and devil-dancers of old Asia still function
in the village; the old Oriental art of poison-
ing is maintained as the secret of a female
caste who obtain their acolytes from peasant
families by purchase and make them deaf
and dumb. The villagers hate and fear and
sometimes lynch the respected company of
witches, but they resort to them for in-
struction in the art of doing away with
drunken husbands or attracting fresh lovers.
An ancient institution in Asia are the
eunuchs, and their counterpart in Russia
is found in the sJcoptsy. They are the
“white doves” whose sad, yellow faces are to
be seen in the counting-houses of the cities,
where they form a special caste of wealthy
bankers. They believe that mankind will
exist only so long as there are men prepared
of their own freewill to deprive themselves
of the power of perpetuating their race, and
at least one male in all shoptsy families
is dedicated to this pathetic martyrdom.
Even in Singapore one still sees examples
of the typically Oriental custom of self-
flagellation. but only occasions of high festi-
val provide the spectacle. In Russia the
“doggers" are a sect with ramifications that
extend through the peasants’ homes up to
the palace precincts of Tsarskoye Selo. The
cult at one time became so popular that the
Government began a savage persecution.
“Floggers” were given a taste of their own
medicine in the public squares to the music
of military drums, and scores of them
perished: yet the flogging mysteries still
flourished amongst merchants and aristo-
crats in pre-war St. Petersburg. It is signi-
ficant of how ineradicable these primitive
impulses of the Russian soul are that the
headquarters of the anti-Bolshevik leader,
Koltchak, should have quiekly fallen under
the same influences as the old Imperial court:
all military decisions were referred to spirit-
ualistic mediums: the Commander in Chief
was engrossed in Christian and unchristian
mysticism, and when division arose between
the strategists a Russian hero of the Napo-
leonic wars was summoned by a nomad
shaman to help them out.
Bolshevism in its first raptures gave the
old instincts sufficient outlet; but when the
revolutionary outburst had served their pur-
pose, the proletariat’s new masters imposed
repression more drastic than before. It is
the national sub-conscious fighting to cir-
cumvent this repression that has caused the
reappearance with redoubled force of the
old cults of the occult, devil-worship, self-
torture and the strange religion of the anti-
CH rest which makes mothers destroy children
born with strange marks on them, and epi-
demics of self-immolation affect whole dis-
tricts. Ossendowski’s terrible picture
makes it easier to understand the course
events have taken in Russia since Lenin
lot loose the proletariat upon the State.
Whether he was more fool than knave to try
to build his asylum of such material will
probably never be decided.
“YOU AND EACH OF YOU.”
“It is a strange thing that 12 men of ordinary
commonsense cannot agree. The facts are simple';
the evidence is clear. If you do not agree you will
have to he locked up for the night.” —Extract from
homily of any old Judge to any old jury any old day.
Your Honor. —We of the jury are, I
think, the only persons employed in this
court who habitually lose money on the job.
Those of us who are business men see our
affairs drifting to chaos. If workers, wo
likely fall out with the boss and maybe lose
our berths. For our consolation we are
frequently accused of stupidity and ob-
stinacy. On occasion it is delicately hinted
that these apparent disabilities are only
the external disguise of the inwardly cor-
rupt. Up to the present we have remained
silent. We have had speeches from the
dock, orations from the Bar, long and (for
those who understand them) illuminating
addresses from the Bench. The jury alone
through the ages has remained silent. The
time is now ripe to speak.
Your Honor states that as men of ordinary
commonsense we ought to be able to agree
upon our verdict. Your Honor leaves it to
be inferred that it is a reflection on our
intelligence that we do not and cannot agree.
You suggest that we have in some way failed
in our duty. You assume that we have a
corporate understanding of homogeneous
quality. Now let me inform you that it is
no part of our duty to agree. Agreement is
accidental, not essential. Your Honor
starts—you have evidently not listened
attentively to the terms of the oath which
vve and each of us took when we commenced
the hearing of this case. For that you are
to be excused. Aon were doubtless pre-
occupied in the preliminaries of your Honor’s
own job. I venture to quote it to you:—
\ou and each of you swear by Almighty God that
you will well and truly try and true deliverance
make between our Sovereign Lord the King and
all persons whom you or any of you shall have in
charge and true verdicts give according to the evi-
dence. Hearken to the evidence.
"\oh <ind each oj you." Your Honor finds
nothing there about agreement. It Ims been
enjoined on ns to hearken to the evidence.
We have hearkened. Each of us is ready
to make, true deliverance per medium of me,
the foreman. Had vve been quadrupeds we
and each of us would probably have followed
the lead of one of us. We have, however,
hut two legs apiece and these are not
feathered.
We have done more than hearken to the
evidence. We have ( 1 think more from
courtesy than from duty) hearkened also to
learned counsel. We liuve observed that,
with the aid-of these skilful dissectors of law
and fact, some of the witnesses have miser-
ably unsaid at one stage of their evidence
what they had cheerfully said at an earlier
stage. This lias not reduced our difficul-
ties. Many witnesses have deposed to cer-
tain things being facts, while others have
sworn with equal confidence that the truth
is not in these deponents. This has not
been helpful. I understand that we may
draw an inference from the demeanor of wit-
nesses as to which is a witness to truth and
which not. As to that, our experience is
that the most plausible are often the biggest
liars. But though this proverb is generally
accepted as sound, we do not think it is yet
capable of universal application. Were it
applied generally it would be very hard on
the Bar.
We have, therefore, not found our task so
easy as it appears to your Honor. We will,
of course, if so required, go back and spend
the night in the jury room. I have an inter-
esting novel in my pocket with which to
pass the time. I am accustomed to reading
in bed, and I look forward to well-earned,
dreamless repose. I do not propose, how-
ever, to discuss this case further with my
jaded fellow jurors.
Does your Honor snort? But why? Why
are you peeked? Consider the position for
once from the standpoint of that eminent
person the man of commonsense. Why
should I attempt further to jostle my col-
leagues out of the opinion which they hon-
estly hold, and which they have arrived at
through so much sweat and tears? On tile
other hand, why should I, who have heark-
ened to everything as per instruction, anil
who formed an opinion when my mind was
more or less fresh and alert, suffer myself
to have another person’s opinion forced on
me by dreadful reiteration now that 1 am
tired and bored? What guarantee will your
Honor have that, any new opinion which 1
may adopt will be better than my previous
one? It would probably be worse. If we.
as a body, are asses, which of the learned
counsel is the ass? Or are they, as your
Honor has gently implied, botli asses? Your
Honor is, of course, immune by Act of Par-
liament.
Moreover, your Honor, are your Honors of
the Bench (confidentially speaking) such
gluttons for agreement? In your honorable
and lucrative business of splitting straws,
how often have you not yourselves split irre-
vocably on the question which was Tweedle-
dum and which Tweedledee? Quite so, your
Honor, I do not count that against you for
unrighteousness. I put it to your credit. But
my point is that if inflexible independence
of mind in a Judge is to be applauded, why
should that mark of excellence be thrown
in the face of a juror as one might unkindly
throw an over-ripe pluck?
You say we are judges merely of plain
facts —a vastly different thing from the
subtleties of law. Your Honor’s interjection
is pertinent, but your argument is not ten-
able. The facts upon 'the right consideration
of which Mr. Prisoner may get 10 years
are infinitely more important than any legal
fiction, however attenuated. Moreover, the
facts are harder to establish. Fiction may
be discovered eventually in refined lore, but
facts, as I have already pointed out, are
often undiscoverable. Still further, the law.
including legal fiction, is based on fact and
the knowledge of facts; so for many reasons
your Honors have much less excuse for dis-
agreement than we.
Then, again, when you look askance at us.
has it occurred to your Honor that at least
some of us may be intelligent and right?
Eleven of us may be enlightened and only
one obdurate. You have not heard about
that. You insist on regarding us as a cor-
poration or a herd. If your Honor was to
be suddenly translated to the jury box, to
be as one of us, you might find that you were
the strong and independent against eleven.
Who. then, would be the wise and who the
mule? Your Honor would of course be
right; but if by superior eloquence and in-
telligence one may swing eleven, what, then
becomes of the Palladium? If it is to be a
one-man decision, better have it from the
Bench than from the jury box. (This may
be an argument against the jury system; but
that does not at present concern me.)
But, your Honor may say, in addition to
our corporate stupidity there is to be con-
sidered our individual dishonesty. We may
be bought—corrupt—in the bag. I venture
to hope that your Honor thinks that some
of us may possibly be honest. But how
many and which?—that is the rub. Being
myself a purist bound by my oath, 1 quite
agree that if any juryman argues for a ver-
dict in which he does not believe he ought
not to be here. Clearly his place is at the
Bar, with a right of succession to the Bench:
but remember, please, that we are plain men
of various trades and occupations. We are
unskilled in the art of make-believe. For
example, my colleague of the Builders
Laborers’ Union remarked in the jury room :
“I’ll stick to my opinion. I speak as I feel
the same as when a brick falls on iny head.
Then it is possible that your Honor’s eager-
ness to convict gives some juryman a bent
towards acquittal. Your Honor asks how
we can know that you favor a conviction.
Sucli a question suggests an even more un-
flattering conception of our mentality on your
part than I had hitherto suspected. My


colleague the rabbit-seller, in his picturesque
way on that aspect of the case, was over-
heard to say. referring to your Honors atti-
tude to the prisoner: “The old chap isn t
licking his chops to get at him for a long-
time is hcV" If 1 may say so without
offence. 1 think the whole jury do agree in
substance with the rabbit-seller on that
point, though I would much prefer that lie
had put it in other language.
GWYNPLATNE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Clumsiest “Scheme” to Date.
Pearce, of the Home and Territories show,
would have been false to his own traditions,
and to those of the eight Ministries in which
lie has drawn salary, if he hadn’t turned up
with an elephantine scheme for putting the
Northern problem in an entirely new aspect,
so that the thinking process will have to
start again from scratch. A Federal elec-
tion is nearing, and, thanks to his 16-years'
record of letting-it-slide, Pearce’s Westra-
lian seat looks like .passing from under him
at last. Wherefore, in the lack of the capa-
city for doing things, the need to make a
froth and a dust by the saying of things is
urgent. Accordingly he proposes that the
Northern Territory, which has found him
no more active than any of his predecessors
and no more active than any of his previous
portfolios found him, should be made a
bigger responsibility than ever by adding to
it those parts of Queensland and Westralia
north of latitude 20. The result would
be a really monstrous Northern Territory
for Pearce to wreak his genius on. The
possibilities in the project (if it isn’t nipped
in the bud) for agitating, speeching, taking
evidence, “going to the people” on the sub-
ject, coming back from the people on the
subject, and for forming leagues and getting
into a dizzy state of propaganda, are obvious.
To carry it through it would be necessary to
obtain the assent of one Federal Parliament,
two State Parliaments and two State popu-
lations. If the five consents were obtained
there would be the same problem of appor-
tioning assets and liabilities as if North
Queensland was becoming a new State in-
stead of a patch on a makeshift province.
This division of assets and liabilities is
always spoken of as an insuperable lion in
the path when the matter of making real
new States is mooted, but for the purposes
of the Pearce project it appears that some
method of mollifying the animal has been
found. According to the sketch put forward,
the new unit of the Commonwealth, measur-
ing about a million square miles, isn’t to be
exactly a Territory nor precisely a State,
hut a species of in-between thing, and in
preparation to become a State. The idea, in
this land of overgrown States, of amalgamat-
ing three great areas with a view to making
the biggest State yet known would be ludi-
crous if the scheme meant only what it
said, but of course it doesn’t. According to
the prospectus the mammoth property is
to be governed by the Commonwealth,
Queensland and Westralia jointly, but
whether they will govern in a Parliamentary
way, or disfranchise the inhabitants and
rule by a commission of some sort, or instal
an autocrat instead of a commission, doesn’t
appear yet. If votes are to run the show
it is worth noting that the great bulk of
the voting power will he at the Queensland
end, and will he largely non-British. The
most obvious translation appears to be that
Westralia and Queensland are to hand over
a large piece of land apiece, and yet not
really hand over anything save perhaps
some debts, for they will only exchange whole
control of one estate for a third control of
an estate four times as large. Any real sur-
render is to be done by the Commonwealth.
The proposed temporary Territory not being
of any account as a loan-raising proposition,
the Commonwealth will naturally be the
money-finding partner. It is easy to sur-
mise that Queensland and Westralia, as joint
rulers, will cordially approve of applying the
general funds, including those of Victoria,
Tasmania and S. Australia, to the building
of that northern East-to-West railway be-
tween Townsville (Q.) and Derby or some
adjacent little town in W.A. for which
Theodore has schemed so hard. They will
also approve, as a matter of course, of tear-
ing up the bond which pledges the Common-
wealth to the direct line from South to
North. With two such coadjutors to accele-
rate him even Pearce might show a turn of
speed for the first time in his life. When
the really expensive work is done, and some
settlement achieved, the monster province,
with its three-headed control, will presum-
ably dissolve from sheer unwieldiness, and
the handiest way will be for the north-west
and north-east fragments to dissolve back
whence they came. In other words Westralia
and Queensland will take hack, in an im-
proved state, the hits of land which they
lent, but didn’t part with, to compile
Pearce’s Phantom Province. The advent
of a costly “expert” from England to report
on harbors in the area raises the question
whether the Prime Minister is lending an
ear to his colleague’s lumbering devices. It
would really be better if the well-meaning
Bruce got busy on the work that is nearest,
and proceeded to fulfil the plain contract
on which the transfer of the Northern Terri-
tory was based. That definite action, and
nothing else, would put a stop to the jug-
glings of a crowd of minor political per-
formers who apparently never heard of the
sanctity of an oath or a promise.. Then, with
a short and easy road by which settlement
could reach the Gommonwealth’s own Posses-
sion in the North, a new beginning would be
made, and one beginning is worth more than
10 conspiracies.
Our Pacifist Navy-Builders.
It is reported that the Bruce-Pac<e Govern-
ment is to be challenged, when the House of
Reps, meets, on its decision to get the two
10,000-ton cruisers built in Scotland. The
debate will he interesting if it shows not
only the Government’s reasons, given in their
totality, for sending the second order abroad
—and the public wants to be satisfied that
those reasons are adequate—but whether it
has any ideas as to the building of warships
in one of the neglected deep-water ports.
And the speeches of certain Labor leaders,
now represented as steady supporters of naval
construction, promise some thrills. When
the Defence Equipment Bill was dealt with
in the House of Heps., Frank Anstey, the
member for Bourke. w T as leading the Labor
Opposition in the absence of Matthew
Charlton, who w’as on his way to Geneva.
The Prime Minister had said that “the Gov-
ernment' is very anxious that at least one
cruiser should be built in Australia." On
this Anstey, who followed him, remarked:
“The Government proposes to appropriate
£2,000,000 for the construction of two
cruisers for the defence of Australia”; and,
declaring that the Prime Minister had been
“unable to discover any facts to justify the
proposed expenditure,” he moved the sub-
joined amendment: —
That, as efforts are being made by the President
of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great
Britain to convene another conference to deal with
the question of further disarmament, and in view
of the early sitting of the League of Nations, it is
the opinion of this House that naval construction
should be deferred for the present.
And the following sentiments w 7 cre heaved at
the Hansard reporters by the mover of the
amendment and other representative Labor
speakers:—
Anstey: The Labor party accepts the statement
of the Prime Minister that, it is the desire of every
man and woman in Australia to decrease armaihents,
and it proposes to act in accordance with that desire.
Its members, therefore, will not vote for millions
of pounds to be spent upon additional armaments
against that desire. How futile will be the expendi-
ture of this vast sum Of money! Why should we
waste our money in building these two cruisers?
Lazzarini : 1 agree with Mr. Anstey that the build-
ing of these two cruisers will place Australia in a
dangerous position. The proposal of the Government
is calculated not to benefit Australia but to injure
her. If we build these cruisers other nations
will be justified in becoming suspicious of Australia.
McGrath: We should be preaching the gospel of
peace and inculcating it in the minds of our children
instead of talking about spending millions of pounds
upon the construction of battleships. Our colors are
nailed to the mast. We will not take part in any
Imperialistic war; we believe that these cruisers
are to be constructed only' to further the cause of
Imperialism.
Riley : The proposal violates the spirit of the
Washington Treaty, I support the amendment moved
by the aeting-Leader of the Opposition, and the
Labor party is prepared to submit it to the people
at the next elections.
Brennan : With the miserable make-believe pro-
posed by the Government, these two cruisers pat-
rolling somewhere— God knows where —this waste of
£4,000,000 upon the construction of vessels that
are to be sunk almost as soon as they are built,
1 have no sympathy. Our strongest weapon of
practical defence is the conciliation of the other
nations of the world.
Also, when Gabb, the Labor member for
Angas, said he intended voting for the bill
and against liis leader’s amendment, one of
his colleagues told him not to make a fool
of himself, and another invited him to “hop
outside” and get his head punched. In the
result the unhappy Gabb was “disciplined”
into voting for the amendment. And this is
the partv that now poses as being afire with
indignation because the two cruisers are not
to be built at Cockatoo. The cynical effron-
tery of it!
The Biggest State, and the Least.
The Federal Commission which is sitting to
hear Westralian politicians explain why
their State should get another big gift from
its neighbors still pursues its way. Mean-
while the W.A. Government has smoothed
the path of comment by sending east printed
copies of its case. It is as persuasive a case
as can be made out of very poor materials,
though some of the pleas almost suggest a
reckless dependence on the elasticity of the
Commission’s leg. For instance, it is urged
that “without the concurrence of Western
Australia Federation was an impossible
dream. W.A. comprises almost one-third of
the entire continent of Australia, and if she
had stood out of Federation the idea of
Federation would have been killed.” Most
people recognised that it would have been
fatal if N. S. Wales had stood out, for it
represented the biggest mass of population,
or if S. Aus., which then carried the N. Ter-
ritory with it, had absented itself, for then
the Commonwealth would have been cut in
halves. But no one regarded Westralia as
in the same category. Australia did without
it for 41 years (1788-1829) and _ existed
somehow. S. Australia also brought into the
partnership nearly one-third of the continent,
and it hasn’t been paid for its adhesion yet,
nor has it sent in its bill for blackmail. And,
anyhow, if Federation is the rotten thing
Westralian politicians profess it is, the com-
munity owes them nothing for allegedly
bringing it about. On page 8 of the “case”
appears a list dealing with the growth of
population in the different States. It re-
veals that from the beginning of the old
colony to the beginning of Federation the
Westralian population grew at the average
rate of barely 2700 per annum. In the sub-
sequent or Federal period the increase was
7120 per annum. And the percentage of
increase since the union is the largest save
that of N. S. Wales. The object of the
population table is, therefore, far from clear.
Another peg on which to hang a claim is the
burden of administering so huge an area.
Yet no one insists that the little crowd at
Perth should worry about all the vast prop-
erty. There is no reason why it shouldn’t
- hand over its tropical garden to the Common-
wealth as 8. Australia did. A further plea
for “compensation” is to the effect that Big-
john’s State went into the union in a lofty
and self-sacrificing and trustful spirit—in
fact, that it effected its entry without mak-
ing reservations for its own security. Yet
actually Westralia secured a separate and
very profitable tariff of its own for five years ;
it. negotiated a subsidy, at the general cost,
of something like £2,000,000, spread over a
term of years; and it obtained, at the general
charge, a railway worth £7,000,000 or so.
It looks almost like the cormorant at the
feast, instead of the poor hound. A table
attached to the brief of the eminent Iv.C.
who prepared the document gives a view of
the accumulated surpluses (two) and the
accumulated doficits (four) of the six States
during 22 years (1902-23). It looks reason-
ably accurate. Westralia has the biggest
deficit. But each State has a sinking-fund
of some sort, as a set-off to its shortage,
and Westralia has far the largest one —
thanks to the foresight of persons dead and
gone. These are the latest available figures:

And it is Westralia, with its surplus, which
is the chronic cadger of the community!
Westralia and Tasmania are the only States
which have obtained direct monetary assist-
ance from the Commonwealth. How they
struggled to meet their liabilities out of
their own resources before they extended the
hat is partly shown by the respective taxa-
tion doings. In the 22 years 1901-02 to
1922-23 Westralia twice collected the highest
taxes per head among the six States, but that
was 18 years ago. In four years it collected
the second highest; in five years it ranked
third; three times it was fourth; four times
its tax rate was the lowest but one, and four
times it ranked absolutely lowest. In the
eight years when its taxes were lowest it
had eight deficits. In the same 22 years
there were 13 in which Tasmania taxed its
far-from-golden community at a higher rate
per head than any of its neighbors, in a heroic
effort to keep solvent. Three times it ranked
second highest; once it was third; on four
occasions it was fourth; and once it taxed
on the lowest scale, but that was 21 years
ago, before the need to face the situation was
apparent. Thirteen firsts in 22 years left
mighty few records to divide among the
island's five neighbors. During the 10 years
from 1918-14 onwards, when war and other
troubles made it evident that finance was
likely to be in a bad way, Westralia exacted
from its people, on an average, £1 18s. 9d.
per inhabitant per annum, which was 7s. 7d,
per inhabitant below the average of the six
States (£2 6s. 4d.). Tasmanian taxation
averaged £2 12s. 2d. per head per year, or
ss. lOd. above the average. The isle of few
resources was making a genuine effort to keep
off the pension list. Yet when Tasmania
made its appeal for a little accommodation it
was told gruffly to levy some more taxes,
and put its house in order first. But when
Westralia made its demand, a Royal Com-
mission hastened westward to see what could
be done. Which possibly shows the advan-
tage of owning a big estate and having a
peer in the family.
Cabbages and Kings.
Ttte Stuarts came back to the throne, but
they didn’t stay long, and it wasn’t the origi-
nal throne-loser who did it (he having
lost his head), but his son. The Bourbons
came back, but they didn’t stay long either,
arid it wasn’t the throne-dropper who did
it (lie had also lost his head, which seems
the detachable end of kings), but his small
brother. The Bonabartes returned (not the
one who went away, but his rather dubious
nephew), and their stay was even shorter.
The Egbert family re-appeared on the throne
of England, after being off it during three
reigns, and lasted through the time of one
miserable saint, when the dynasty which had
taken so much trouble to revive died again.
Egbert himself wasn’t restored, but as he
had been buried for 203 years that was
natural. The difference between the original
dynasty and the restored one is apparently
the same as between the original joint and
the hash. It will be in the natural order
of things that the Hoiienzollerns should
have another run, and prove a disillusion-
ment and a dud. The fact that Ludendorff,
who proposed to be the General Monk of
the restoration, was a shocking failure as a
Presidential candidate proves nothing. The
time isn’t ripe for General MONK-ing till the
Hun industries are fully rebuilt (and they
are rebuilding now faster than anything
else on earth), till enough indemnity has been
paid to create a soothing delusion that some
more is likely to be paid, till Germany has
got into the League of Nations and disinte-
grated that ramshackle concern by the
familiar white-ant tactics, till (as a free and
full-blown member of the League) it has
successfully protested against foreign officers
snooping round and criticising its surrep-
titious armaments, and till some of the
Cromwells are dead. The annoying thing
about Cromwell, if any attempt had been
made in his lifetime to put the young man
on the throne, was that he remembered the
old man too well. In addition to all the
other reasons for delay it is better to wait
till old William is dead, lest he should mis-
take himself for the restored person, and to
find a younger Monk than Ludendorff, and
one with fewer defeats on his record. The
Prussians, who run Germany and yet are
not German, have never shown any tendency
for republican institutions, and as there was
never before a Prussian State without a
Hotienzollern at the top of it they have a
sentimental attachment for the disreputable
old family. When it comes back they will
probably realise that they had simply for-
gotten how bad it was, and bury the senti-
ment.
A Cobweb in a Dream.
A railway runs due east from Moree to a
dead end at Inverell (N.S.W.) ; and it is
understood that there is no hope at all of an
extension of the line for 150 miles further
east, because that would connect this rich
district with the main Sydney-Brisbane line,
the coastal Sydney-Brisbane line, and two
N.S.W. ports of more or less quality. But
of late the Public Works Committee has
departed, in a sense, from its old attitude,
and has taken to recommending new lines in
the north of the Ma State, though never the
ones that are most in demand. Thus as the
Moree-Inverell line runs east, and the natural
idea is to carry it on eastward to the coast,
the Committee passed a line to run north
and a little west to an isolated dead end at
Ashford, some 35 miles distant. Since then
it has done something even more remark-
able. Grafton and Coff’s Harbor have no
luck with their demand for 150 miles of new
railway to connect them with their own
tableland at. Glen Innes and Inverell. The
w’ork, it is stated with monotonous persist-:
ence, would not pay. But the Committee has
passed a northward line to connect Grafton
with Killarney, a village in S. Queensland
which joins up by a branch line with Bris-
bane, per long circuit via Warwick. This
WTork is to be 161 miles long, wiiich is 11
miles longer than the constantly rejected
one to the adjacent N.S.W. tableland. It is
expected to cost £3,529,190, or £21,920 per
mile, and it is expected to lose £213,000 per
annum (£1323 per mile each year). Appa-
rently the w’orst loss in all the State’s bleak
record doesn’t matter in this case. But
why doesn’t it matter? The Committee then
had another period of energy, and recom-
mended a line also northward (i.e., toward
the Queensland border) from Casino to a
dead end at the hamlet of Bonalbo. This work
is to be 31 miles long and to cost £825,000.
or £26,613 per mile. The anticipated loss
in this case doesn’t appear to have been fur-
nished. If these expensive hill-climbing
works are completed, the hitherto neglected
north of N.S.W. will be possessed of five
parallel railways for a considerable distance,
to say nothing of the proposed Inverell-
Ashford work, which will do the parallel
act in the offing. And with it all the N.S.W.
northern tableland will be as far from hav-
ing even moderately direct railway communi-
cation with the N.S.W. northern coast as
ever it was. Should the North get all the
money-losing north-and-south connections with
Sydney with which it is threatened it will
have a vast; mass of bankrupt luggage to
carry with it should it chance to secede, and
will have most of its natural lines still to
build, if the desire to bring about this
rotten condition of things in the reason of
the Committee’s antics, the community which
pays the expenses ought to be informed. The
State’s railway map already looks like a
cobweb in a blood-drinker’s dream, and the
tendency is for the worse.
The Pacifist in a Bellicose Mood.
In an article which has been adopted as an
A.W.U. manifesto, the Worker launches a
furious attack on “the horde of cheap, igno-
rant and low-grade aliens who are being
brought here to-day from Italy, from Greece,
from Jugo-Slavia and other countries of the
south of Europe.” Explaining that it “re-
alises the importance of that thrilling slogan
‘Workers of the World, Unite!’ ” it describes
these particular workers of the world as
“degraded importations, miserable semi-
slaves, human flotsam and jetsam of the
Mediterranean, scum and dregs and drifting
rubbish,” also “deleterious matter skimmed
off the simmering brew of Italy,” where
“the monster Mussolini” monsts and
musses. Certainly an odd way of showing
that you are internationalist to the back-
teeth ! The U.S.A., it seems, has “cut off
the stream that was depositing so much mud
and slime upon her soil from Southern
European countries,” and the Worker is
clearly of opinion that Australia can do
likewise. But the American laws excluding
Japanese and all but a trickle of Italians
are backed by force. The Republic lias
.110,000,000 inhabitants, and its navy, now
that Britain has accepted the one-Power
standard, is as strong as any in the world,
perhaps stronger. Australia has 5,800.000
inhabitants and a navy consisting of four
light cruisers, two of them obsolete or nearly
so. And the Worker would like to see even
that poor navy abolished. Does anyone
imagine that Japan or Italy would accept
the American exclusion laws if the Republic
bad 5,800,000 people, with the Brisbane, the
Adelaide, the Sydney and the Melbourne for
their first line of defence? Of course, Aus-
tralia is a foundation member of the League
of Nations, and could bespeak the help of
that body if it copied the U.S. immigration
policy and the same were challenged. But
Greece and Italy are also foundation mem-
bers of the League of Nations, and when
they fell out over the Corfu business and
the stronger member bashed the weaker into
submission, the League was conveniently
asleep. It might be argued, again, that
Australia is a British Dominion, and that
J. Bull would not let an aggrieved foreign
nation make war on it without joining in;
but British intervention in such a ouarrel
would be a form of “Imperialism,” and
“Imperialism” the Worker loathes. Still
it is on this very “Imperialism” that our
bellicose pacifists and exclusionist Marxians
rely. Opposed to an Australian navy,
opposed to an Australian army, opposed to
immigration they hurl insults at foreign
countries —insults which, Bruce complains,
he has had to ask the representatives of the
countries attacked not to transmit to their
Governments —and demand a rigid exclu-
sion policy, their expectation being that
J. Bull will shield them from the conse-
quences, even if he has to shed his blood.
It is an attitude that is beneath a black-
fellow’s contempt.
Tiie Arabian Blight.
“C.0.M.” leads a new crusade: —
Where the desert breezes ruffle the palms about
the loneliest camel pad in the world, a number of
squalid Arabs learned to play an utterly inane game
and named it the Arabic equivalent of arithmetic.
They considered it an excellent way of passing the
time between murders in a country where there was
nothing to do, nothing to see, scarcely anything to
cat and much less to drink. Even fiction —the
earlier pastime of the race —had grown wearisome;
and the song about the camel —a still more ancient
mode of killing unnecessary hours—had lost a great
deal of its charm. Arithmetic, as conducted with
the newly invented figures, became all the rage.
It was evident even to the lowest intelligence that
no finer method of wasting life had been discovered.
Of course, other nations had played a game something
like it, with a cruder system of numerals, ever since
the first bold investigator discovered that he had an
equal number of toes on each foot, but. to the Arab
belongs the credit of perfecting an occupation of
innate futility entirely suitable to the driest part
of the dreariest desert on earth. Arithmetic is an
entirely sapless thing, grotesque, inhuman, bringing
the spirit of death and utter desolation to every
land and life it touches.
People who assert that arithmetic has its uses are
entirely blinded by custom. Great tracts of the
earth’s surface achieved a high state of culture
before anything more complicated than the mere
counting of toes had been evolved. Ancient Greece
and Rome only played the game to a very, limited
extent; and it is plain historical fact that when
the full futility of arithmetic with its insanity of
grotesques, known as figures, came from Arabia to
Europe, that continent immediately dropped back
into the barbarism we know as the Middle Ages.
Arithmetic failed in more than two thousand years
to lift its chief players, the Arabs, a single degree
in civilisation, and elsewhere it is clear that the
progress of humanity has gone on in spite of the
tremendous handicaps which the Arab invention im-
posed upon it. It is perfectly true that the life
we now lead requires a little arithmetic, just as
some diseases demand occasional doses of irritant
poisons; but in a thoroughly healthy society there
would be an immediate demand for the total prohi-
bition of figures. Clearly all the counting
which the average man is unable to do on his
fingers, toes and the palings of his garden fence is
not merely lowering in a moral sense, but unnatural,
and therefore anti-soeial and opposed to the prin-

oiples of human evolution. As compared with the
ravages of patience, ping-pong, fiction-reading and
other time-destroying devices of perfectly empty
minds, those of arithmetic look serious indeed.
There are young men whose lives are almost entirely
devoted to this thing who cannot be said in any real
sense to live at all. Their time is wasted in playing
with Arabic grotesques, and that occupation keeps
their minds under a baleful hypnotic influence which
stunts both soul and body.
Such .uses as arithmetic is claimed to possess —
and the claim has never been substantiated in any
court of logic—can be served equally well by the
calculating machines now in vogue. These machines
possess twice the brain capacity of the average book-
keeping clerk ; and the proposal to give them votes
at the State and Federal elections has very strong
support from leading business men. It is per-
fectly evident that, possessing such mechanical con-
trivances, no human creatures should be employed in
arithmetic, except on the ground that two or three
of them can be bought for the price of one machine.
But all such matters are merely the commonplaces
of modern thinking men; the dark regions to which
such thought has not yet penetrated are the Education
Departments of our various States. Incredible as it
seems, enormous sums of money are spent every year
teaching the children of perfectly respectable parents
to play arithmetic! This desert game of squalid
and wholly non-intellectual Arabs is made the chief
study of those who are to be citizens of the Com-
monwealth, to the complete exclusion of education.
If- these children did not educate themselves to some
extent, and break away from the absurdity forced
upon them by their teachers, they would necessarily
become second-rate clerks, their entire mental and
physical powers having been destroyed by over-
indulgence in arithmetic. As two calculating
machines are worth four such clerks, it is evident
that the pernicious system now in vogue is con-
stantly reducing the effective power of our popula-
tion. Entire prohibition of arithmetic might in
the present period of moral decay be hard to en-
force ; but a common regard for the decencies of life
should make us insist upon its being kept away from
children in their tender years. If they take to it
afterwards, as some of them possibly may, the
conscience of the community will be at least clear,
in that the new generation has been given a reasonable
chance of escaping the Arabian blight.
The Queensland Opposition.
Queensland Labor is chuckling: once more
at the BouRBON-like stupidity of the State
Opposition. Realising that the Brennan
appointment had offended people who gener-
ally vote Labor, and that it might lose the
Toowoomba seat with a candidate of the coat-
trailing and corn-crushing order, the crowd
in office nominated a well-liked local iden-
tity who could be depended upon to poll a
strong vote regardless of his politics— Evan
John Llewelyn, superintendent of the Too-
woomba Ambulance centre. The Opposition,
on the other hand, selected James Tolmie,
once a member of the Denham Government,
which is remembered without enthusiasm,
and now an elderly calamity-howler with
no appeal to the considerable proportion of
electors who have qualified since .1918, when
he lost his seat. It selected him at a ballot
which was thrown open to all the Too-
woomba people enrolled on March 10, a privi-
lege which was availed of by grinning Labor
supporters to vote numerously for the man
they reckoned easiest to beat on April 4.
Even then Tolmie only defeated Godsall,
sometime mayor of Toowoomba (Garde,
president of the district Diggers, was the
third aspirant), by four votes in a poll of
1012; and ardent Godsallites, not unnatu-
rally, showed little interest in tin' subsequent
proceedings. This comic-opera plebiscite
was preceded by the usual brisk row among
Opnosition organisations. Early in the piece
King, Elpiiinstgne, Kerr and Peterson,
M’s.L.A. (King is styled “leader of the
United party,” although Moore is “leader
of the Opposition”), rushed up from Brisbane
and addressed a meeting “for the purpose of
selecting a candidate to contest the seat.”
Thereupon they were querulously asked by
the Brisbane Courier whether they repre-
sented “the National Union and a National
Union party that appears to be in process of
formation, or the United party and its organ-
isation,” since “the United Parliamentary
party” had not authorised their mission.
“Toowoomba,” the paper added, “is a proud,
democratic and self-reliant constituency, and
it is not a place that will take kindly to the
National Union, which has become a seri-
ously disintegrating element in local politics,
or to interference by some arrogant repre-
sentative of southern money interests such
as that of which Mr. Charles Taylor.
M.L.A. (himself ‘leader of the United
party’ until a short time ago), and Mr.
Shipley have given such concrete examples.”
Having only a rabble of cackling feudists to
contend against, the Labor party, of course,
retained the seat. More than that, it in-
creased its majority from 366 to 760. In
the circumstances the wonder is that the
representative of the several Disunited par-
ties should have got 2646 votes. The last
three Federal contests and the Greater Bris-
bane polls have shown that where there is
something like unity on the other side, and
something like a policy, and something like
intelligence in the direction of the campaign,
Labor-socialism can be beaten in Queensland.
But it will never be beaten in the State
sphere while the Opposition is split into yelp-
ing groups without leadership and without a
policy—groups that apparently hate one
another as much as they hate Labor.

A fire which destroyed 1700 houses would
be a terrible disaster to an Australian city,
but in Japan it is more or less in the day's
work. Every Japanese city is alleged to be
completely burnt and rebuilt once within
every generation. Made of paper, bamboo,
mud and wattles, a Japanese house afford-
ing as much accommodation as an ordinary
suburban cottage in Australia is completed
in five days. There is an air of hasty
improvisation about even a landscape in
Japan, and there is something of the
nomad about its inhabitants. The moun-
tains are constantly being shaken down and
the plains heaved up, new islands made and
old ones engulfed. The country has had
over (10 capitals, of most of which no trace
remains; and the most venerable shrines
are built of wood, and therefore only a cen-
tury old. It is on such foundations that
Japanese statesmen have tried to build a
modern State, with its enormous weight of
bricks, mortar and machinery, its traditions
of permanence and its ability to bear the
burden of enormous armaments. That the
strains are great is shown by the restless
hysteria of the people at moments of national

excitement. From the consequences of this
hysteria the astute Elder Statesmen have
hitherto saved the nation ; but the mob never
likes its emotions to be interfered with, and
the present political fight in Japan centres
in the attempt to get rid of the old leaders.

“Billy See”; A large number of well-mean-
ing people are growing excited over what
they are pleased to term the Southern Euro-
pean influx —into Queensland particularly.
Westralia experienced the same incursion
between 15 and 25 years ago. Large num-
bers of Italians and Slavs arrived on the
goldfields, and it was persistently stated and
believed that mine, managers and wood-line
directors aimed at reducing wages by means
of these aliens. Yet none of those dismal
prophecies have been fulfilled. Wages have
risen steadily along w T ith the standard of
living, and the British miner still holds his
own on what is left of the Golden Mile.
The Dagoes were regarded as potential scabs,
but I never came across a single instance of
their submitting to be used as such. In
fact, when Ned Hogan, lately a Victorian
Minister, organised the firewood cutters on
the Kurrawang w T ood line, the Dagoes joined
up like one man. Of the thousands of
Italians who came to the goldfields and
worked as miners, a big percentage have since
settled on the land, and their children, edu-
cated in our State schools, are growing up
good Australians. Round about Perth the
old-time Groper used to regard the Chow as
the only person capable of growing vege-
tables cheaply and efficiently. Nowadays the
Italian is ousting the Asiatic. Here’s an
example of what the race can do. More
than 20 years ago a couple of undersized
runts snatched a job on the Ivanhoe G. M.
They had about a dozen words of English
between them, and because of this disability,
coupled with a tigerish zeal, they got more
than their share of scorn and cheap practical
jokes. They hung on for a few years and
then went on the land—just outside Boulder,
of all places. They bashed up the lumps
of briek-hard dirt, manured and watered, and
coaxed all sorts of things to grow. During
the past 15 years these two Italians have
supplied the Kalgoorlie markets with
hundreds of tons of fresh vegetables. One
of them now pays the Goldfields Water
Scheme an average of £4O per month for
what he uses on four acres. Incidentally,
each gardener has reared a family of seven
children. And many other case's of good
settlers from Italv could be cited. Of course
everyone would like to see Australia popu-
luted with people of British stock; but any
white man is better than a yellow one.

“F.N.W.” : WHEN —or if—the Common-
wealth steamers are knocked down to a
bidder, it will b. interesting to note If
any of the conditions of sale will touch the
question of the continued employment of the
officers and engineers that staff the ships at
the present time. The usual practice of new
owners is to offer such men retention at the
expense of a “step,” i.e., captains revert to
chiefs and chiefs slump to seconds. This
happened when the 8.1. absorbed the Apcar
Line, and also. I believe, with the passing
of Archibald Currie’s vessels. On the
other hand, the survivors of Lund’s Blue
Anchor ships scored somewhat when they
were taken into the Inchcape fold, old man
Lund insisting that the staffs should be re-
tained at full status when he sold out after
the tragic loss of the Waratah off the South
African coast. To give the I*, and O. direc-
tors their due, it can be added that they have
carried out scrupulously their side of the
contract. But, as matters stand, owing to
the retarded promotion in the mercantile
marine of late years, any first-class concern
that was compelled to take over the “Bay”
officers, with their few years’ service in the
C.G.L., and to place them on full equality
with its own men (average 20 to 25 years’
of service from fifth officer to command),
would probably find the Government’s effort
provocative of much trouble.

Commissioner Clapp seems to be as proud
of his “Reso” train as he is of his slogans,
and the Melbourne dailies are equally en-
thusiastic ; but the cocky is beginning to
have his doubts. The “Reso” train is a sort
of travelling show stuffed with exhibits in-
tended to display the resources of Victoria
and in some vague fashion teach the people
who see it how to become better farmers.
In order to do this, a number of carriage-
are tilled with more or less distinguished visi-
tors. members of Parliament and other live-
stock of the human species. Currumburra,
impressed with the hazy idea that the
“Reso” train is somehow for its benefit, rose
to the occasion the other day. a number of
its citizens disbursing os. each for a recep-
tion at which the tourists on the train were
guests; but when, in a rather stunned
fashion, it tried to estimate the benefit that
had accrued to it. all it could remember was
some airy remarks by a visitor from Canada
that Australia was a great country, and
some glowing references to the farmers as
the backbone of the land by a city M.L.A.
No information had been distributed about
how to grow an extra turnip, or increase
Strawberry’s yield of butter-fat by a fraction.
But somebody remembered that sundry
freight trains with perishable produce had
been held up to let through the “Iteso”
train with its queer load of tourists, and
Currumburra became distinctly cynical. So
a man from Currumburra was commis-
sioned by his disgruntled fellow-citizens to
ask The Bulletin exactly what is the use
of the “Reso” train; and Tiie Bulletin can
only suggest that it is merely another of
those expensive circuses intended to obscure
the absence of useful work to improve the
lot of the man on the land.

“Ex-Dig.” : The TJ.S. Government has con-
cluded, after anti-aircraft guns had fired at
kites towed by ’planes without registering a
single hit in 880 shots, that anti-aircraft
gunnery is a futile arm of defence. The
war made that pretty certain without any
peace-time experiments. Even with rifle fire
it was difficult to hit a ’plane. At Meteren
in 1918 I had my first experience of the
newly introduced system of engaging troops
with machine-gun fire from an aeroplane.
As the Hun sailed towards us at a low alti-
tude, we looked upon it as a gift from the
gods. We felt quite secure in our trench
possie, and keen rivalry was displayed to
win the prize and holiday which was the
due of the man who brought down an aero-
plane with the rifle. By all rules that
aeroplane should have been riddled, but it
wasn’t; and the swoop of the ’plane directly
at us, first from the front and then from
the rear, peppering bullets all around us,
was so unpleasant that very soon most of
tlie ground shooters had decided that pot-
shotting at ’planes was no sport, and had
retired to dug-outs. Bullet-proof shields
and the ease with which the high-velocity
bullet can be deflected may have had some-
thing to do with the failure of a whole com-
pany, including some crack shots, to lodge a
hit. For that matter, the airman didn’t
get any hits either; but the attack from
above made us feel as if our coyer was torn
from us, and we were field mice cowering
under the swoop of a hawk. We were all
relieved, I think, when a fighting ’plane of
our own came along and drove the marauder
off. The only effective counter to the air-
flier is another machine of the same species;
and even then, according to the testimony
of experts, most of the hits were scored from
above.
-♦
“Mingamab” : The softwoods v. hard-
woods controversy is with us again,
and Forestry Leaguers, theorists and
armchair-carpenters are doing nearly all
the arguing. From builders and trades-
men comes a great silence. When they do
talk they are prepared to grant the superior
strength, durability, beauty and cheapness of
the Australian product—if properly kept and
conditioned. Green, improperly selected and
carelessly stacked and dried, as is too often
the case, it is the trickiest, twistiest, most
exasperating of materials. Further, seasoned
hardwood demands in use the skill of the
joiner rather than the slapdash hack-and-
cliop methods of the half-carpenter now let
loose on so many jobs. Misfits in cutting or
joining softwood may be remedied with bits
tacked on with wire nails; with slim wedges
knocked in where tongues and tenons do not
match; with plugs of putty and licks of
whitelead. Again, hardwood splits easily;
thin nails will not penetrate its tough fibres ;
its close grain insists that a fit must “fit”
or be noticeable; its fine markings demand
the disclosing varnish rather than the all-
disguising paint; mistakes made in matching
shout aloud their incongruities. It necessi-
tates, in short, more care, better tradesman-
ship, slower progress. That means higher
cost per job. In addition, hardwood is
heavier than softwoods, which means stronger
joists to carry frames, stronger frames to
carry rafters, and so more expense. Hard-
wood is most usable when at its worst — i.c.,
green. Its' shrinkability at that stage is
astonishing, as may bo seen in some of those
war-service homes. When seasoned it is
hard on tools, skill and temper; and wdien
worked up it is so attractive and has cost so
much that it seems a waste to bury it in
sub-structures and under paint in places
where cheap, undressed Oregon would serve
as well.

The appearance of Australia’s first Ger-
man indemnity payment recalls memories of
1918. Eric Geddes, in the British elections
oi that year, said he would squeeze Germany
until you could hear the pips squeak. Lloyd
George stated that not only should Germany
pay the whole cost of the war, but that she
could. A venerable peed* calculated the avail-
able wealth of the country from the esti-
mated size of its coal measures, its probable
mineral resources and the area and possible
productivity of its land, and invited the
Allies to walk in and take the lot. The
whole cost of the war has been estimated at
from 24,000 millions upward, and the inter-
est on this would be 1200 millions. Under
the Dawes scheme Germany is being asked
to pay this year 50 millions, Australia’s pro-
portion being £1.35,000; and a loan had to be
made to the debtor to obtain even this!
Meanwhile the statesmen rvho produced the
original prospectus awe still at large. They
are not all in power, but some of them —in
Australia and elsewhere—have great hopes.
The Drys got a fearful doing in Westralia
on Saturday. At the 1921 local-option poll
they scored 31,303 vofles against 37.710 (or
38.242 against 39,875 if the “reduction” vote
is added in one case and “increase” in the
other), but at the State-wide affair last
week they were beaten by 70.000 to 38,000,
with many Outback ballot-boxes to be
counted. And the Outbacker, except in
some of the farming districts, has no use for
compulsory drouth. The truth is that Pro-
hibition is a lost cause in Australia, but the
politicians in some of the States are suffici-
ently in awe of its supporters to yield to
their demands for costly and useless refer-
enda. In Queensland, for instance, though
the people recorded a majority of 88,879
against no-license 18 months ago (the voting
was 232.191 to 143,312), there are to be
local-option polls in selected districts (Cold
Tea does the selecting) in a few weeks.
Victoria is having quite an orgy of de-
centralisation. .Within a week or so we
read of no less than ten vessels loading
wheat at Portland; the Ford Co. has got a
site in Geelong for its works; and the Bal
larat Trustees Co. has bought a block of
buildings in Market-street, Melbourne, for
the growing needs of its chief branch office.
If Parliament wasn’t in such a chronic
state of adjournment on full pay it might
do a kind action by putting its best foot
on the imported match industry. A factory
in Melbourne has space and machinery for
400 more employees, and if the importation
of matches (£267,165 was the value last
year) was reduced by 994 per cent, there
would be work and wages for them all.
Thanks, it is said, to some fresh gyration of
the exchange, it is a case of discharging
workers instead of taking on new ones.
Sweden is one great source of the match
supply, and Sweden wasn’t even an ally in
the war.
THE STATUE OF FIDOETY.
“Gold continues to pour into America in payment of interest on war debts, and the country is seri-
ously alarmed at the accumulation, which is far beyond the country's powers of absorption.
Westralia, which had a skirted politician
in the last Parliament, is to have one in
this, May Holman having been selected to
succeed her late father in the representation
of Forrest, the safest Labor seat in the
Assembly. An amiable and accomplished
young woman, she was her father’s secre-
tary for years and is as well acquainted as
he was with the Forrest electorate and with
the affairs of the Timber Workers’ Pinion,
which dominates it. When only a flapper,
the new member married a legislator ot 22
or thereabouts whom the lighter side of
Parliamentary life demoralised. She divorced
him and resumed her maiden name.
From the Queensland Gallery :
The State Nationalists are looking for a new
leader, and they need one sorely. The indications
are that the job (and the safe seat that goes with it)
will be offered to Hugh Macrossan, who though still
on the sunny side of 40 is a leader of the Queensland
Bar. Macrossan is eloquent and has a personality.
He is a son of that John Murtagh Macrossan who was
a member of Tom Mcllwraith’s Ministries and one
of the fathers of Federation. John Murtagh Maeros-
san’s speeches at the Federal Congress can be read
with profit to-day; they were full of sound Aus-
tralianism. The trouble is that Hugh Macrossan's
practice is worth £6OOO or £7OOO a year, and it is
hard for a young man to give that up, or most of it,
as he would have to do if he took on the leadership
of a party.
Melbourne City’s municipal expenditure
has nearly trebled in 15 years. It was
£244,000 in 1909, and nearly £605,000 last
year; this year is expected to see an in-
crease of at least £30,000, and there are
proposals in the air which may at once lift
the total well towards the threequarter-
rnillion mark. The municipal rate has gone
up to 2s. in the £, and councillors shrink
from the thought of increasing it. But they
also shrink from economy, which is the only
other honest course. Melbourne’s civic head-
quarters don’t stink yet; but the Council is
laying the foundations.
Flowers, President of the N.SAV. Leg.
Council, landed a nasty one on Premier
Fuller at the joint session for choosing a
Senator vice Power. Power had been
chosen only a few months ago to succeed
one of the same color, because Fuller per-
suaded his party that it was the honest
thing to nominate a man of the same crowd
as the one who had dropped out. On the
eve of a general election, however, party
politicians don’t give much away; and
Fuller’s scruples melted. But, when Josiah
Thomas (Nationalist) and Gibbs (Labor)
tied in the voting, Flowers swung his dirty
left by giving the casting vote to Gibbs on
the ground (among others) that on a pre-
vious occasion the Premier had ruled that the
seat should go to one of the same party as
had vacated it. It was a rotten reason;
but it served Fuller right. For his selection
Gibbs probably has to thank Bailey, M.L.A.,
more than any other member —except
Flowers: A. C. Willis hasn’t killed the Goul-
burn man’s influence by a long chalk.
To make it possible for Anzac Day to be
fixed as a statutory holiday, Vic. Premier
Allan suggests cutting out one of the present
holidays. That ought to be easy. The
King’s Birthday is not a holiday in Britain,
and even our loudest trumpeters of royalism
would not accuse England of being “dis-
loyal.” In Melbourne too many holidays
come in a bunch in the autumn —Easter,
Anzac, Eight Hours’, and the King’s.
The British knuckle-unders have been
finding a lot of weird arguments against the
Singapore base, but the most recent, from
the Daily News, takes the chocolates. This
cocoa expert considers that the chief objec-
tion to the base is that it might invite an
attack not on Australia, but on itself. Its
“capture in war time is a staggering possi-
bility,” he says. That is true. The surest
way' of preventing the capture of a great
naval base is not to build one, and the only
way of being dead-sure that you won’t have
your beer stolen is never to have any beer.
As all parties in the Victorian Parliament
favor a contributory superannuation scheme
for Government employees, the bill which
the Allan-Peacock Ministry will submit next
session will have a good chance of enactment
unless the Uppah Chambah —in dread of
more taxation —throws it out. Mindful of
this possibility civil servants and their rela-
tions are arranging to question, retiriug mem-
bers and other candidates seeking election to
the Plush House in June.
The pained astonishment of a section of
the British press at S’Africa’s expressed
intention of abolishing preference to British
goods closely resembles the attitude of the
old maid who has beeu bitten by. her pam-
pered parrot. None of the Dominions has
been so spoon-fed as the Union, and this
petting has been mostly directed to the
Dutch section. These moves to placate the
Afrikander have, however, merely added to
his resentment and suspicion. To the Dutch-
men proper must be added those of mixed
descent—usually more violently anti-British
than their cousins of Dutch or Dutch Hugue-
not stock—and the strong element of militant
Labor which has of late years grown up. and
is largely Clyde-bred. The disappearance of
the South African party—the moderate
Dutch section which was content to accept
British rule—is significant. In its place a
militant Labor party has grown up, and this,
hand in hand with the Nationalists,
the Ilertzog party, is preparing South
Africa for an effort to set up outside the
Empire as a Republic. Hertzog's promise
that the question of secession shall not be
entertained at present only holds good for
the life of this Parliament; after that seces-
sion is to be the main objective of the
Nationalist party in the Union.
The Apprenticeship Bill recommended by
three Boards is to get another run in the Vic-
torian Parliament. This time Alec Peacock,
as Treasurer, Minister for Education and
Minister for Labor, hopes that all parties
will help in passing the measure on which
he has set his heart, even if it has to be im-
proved in a future session. The main idea
in view is to have a controlling commission,
with subsidiary bodies to see that youths are
taught skilled occupations in the workshops
and in technical schools. Naturally the
author of the wages-board system also de-
sires to minimise strikes. A companion
measure he will presently submit will pro
vide for a secret ballot before a strike is
declared.
There was nothing soft about the Ford
people’s method of deciding the site for
their Australian works. They looked at
a number of places or had a number of
places casually mentioned and set them all
bidding against one another. Finally it was
announced that, so far as Victoria is con-
cerned. the decision was for Geelong. Some
time ago the McKay Harvester Co. had the
idea of moving there, the port facilities being
the attraction. Local land sharks promptly
boomed the prices of all suitable land to such
a figure that the project was abandoned.
Probably the memory of that foolish loss
would have kept Geelong from making the
same mistake again ; but the Ford people
took no chances.
Matthew Charlton dropped in at Adel-
aide last week, but failed to improve the
outlook for his party in South Aus. —an out-
look darkened by the collapse of the Labor
Government’s thousand-homes contract and
by the support given by “advanced” local
Laborites to the mad I.WAV. project of boy-
cotting the U.S. fleet. Tackled by a reporter
about the North-South railway, Charlton
clumsily replied that “the question had not
been considered by Labor as a party, but
Labor would do what was right towards all
the States to honor the promises made.”
Considering that Labor was in power when
the Territory was taken over by the Com-
monwealth and for nearly three years after-
wards, and that Charlton has been its leader
in two Parliaments, the answer will be read
in South Australia with feelings of rage and
contempt. Especially as the awkward gen-
tleman from Hunter (N.SAV.) will probably
have a mortal struggle for his leadership
with a man who is committed to the Queens-
land deviation.
If Farmer Allan remains in office as head
of the Vic. Coalition he intends to have the
Newmarket stock saleyard shifted to Laver
ton. 13 miles from Melbourne. It means an
outlay of a million or so, including rail
cockspurs and sidings, roads, water supply,
drainage and the rest; but it’s a job that
has to be faced, and the transfer of noxious
trades will of course follow. It is all merely
another little instalment of the price we
have to pay for crowding half the population
of the State around Batman’s Hill.
“Galleryite”: Dr. C. .T. Fallon’s meagre
attendance in N.SAV. Parliament during the
last three years set us tipping that he would
not again be a candidate in the “Democratic”
(i.e.. Catholic Federation) interest. Now he
has decided to run again. Though capable
of making a good literary speech in favor
of State aid to denominational schools and
such matters, the doctor seems to entirely
lack the political sense. On secular sub-
jects, which constitute 95 per cent, of the
'business of the Legislature, lie rarely had an
opinion to offer. ' The indications are that
both the “Democratic” representative and
the “Protestant Labor” member for New-
castle wall have a rough spin at the elections.
“Guna”: Many of the Digger settlers have
left the blocks which the Victorian mortgage-
lifting Government settled them on at peak
prices, and this Digger rises to complain of
the dirty trick of putting overseas settlers
in their places. On one hoodoo block I
have in mind they “settled” an ex-Indian
officer with £3OO of his own, with the result
that 18 months later he left without a bean
to swell the unemployed army in Melbourne.
Ilis 40 acres of unkindly soil would not take
the water well enough to grow; lucerne, but
saffron thistle flourished amazingly.

The year’s operations gave piebald results.
On one hand, there was a serious slump in
new life business, which meant that tin'
expense rate soared, and the fire and marine
losses were again very heavy; on the other
hand, expenses were reduced substantially
and industrial business showed marked im-
provement. Now the fire, accident and
marine department is to be separated from
the life and, with the solid business of the
Australian Traders’, given a second start in
the world under a new title—Commonwealth
Traders. The C.G.A.’s original prospectus
declared that “a co. doing general insurance
business has a greater opportunitly for ulti-
mate and permanent success than a co. which
transacts one phase of the business only.”
But the office has learned many things since
then. It may even have acouired a sus-
picion that the man who can make boots is
not always much of a watchmaker, and that
the attempt to get hold of somebody who
knows a bit about both things is liable to
be disastrous. With the Carpenters on the
job the transferred business may prove to be
a source of profit instead of being merely a
sponge. Last year’s net premium income in
that branch was £33,680 (£27.845 in 1923),
but losses were £23,989; and as expenses
reached £18,934 the branch was £9157 to the
bad. But here is the whole history item-
ised :

On the Life side both Ordinary and Indus-
trial departments improved. Greater atten-
tion was paid to expenses. New premiums
in Ordinary amounted to £5282 compared
with £13,169 in 1923. The average policy
was £237 compared with £287. But, while
the average amount is important, it is
quality that counts. And quality .has not been
blatantly present in past business. For in-
stance, the business written in 1923 was in
1128 policies producing an annual income of
£14,234. The renewals that year were
£11,021. Last year renewals amounted to
only £14,489, which throws aspersions on the
character of the 1923 business—or the earlier
business, or both. Expenses, as mentioned,
were lighter. But the marked contraction
in new business made it relatively very ex-
pensive, the cost being 236 p.c. as compared
with 144 p.c. in 1923 on the basis of allow-
ing 10 p.c. for the cost of renewals.
The most favorable movement was in In-
dustrial. and on last year’s operations the
high hopes of the promoter and first
managing-driector, the late Thomas Foster,
may be justified. Under his guidance the
co. purchased ready-made Industrial business,
Foster contending that Industrial could he
made very profitable if handled in a large
way. To that end the Industrial policies of
the Life Insurance Co. of Australia were
purchased at a price which made the L.I.A.
cheer, seeing that for 11 years it had been
trying to place the business on its feet. The
Industrial side of the Co-operative was also
purchased and the policies of the Australian
Workers’ Co-operative taken over. When
those deals had been finalised the C.G.A.
held over 16,600 Industrial policies assur-
ing about a half-million and producing an
annual premium income of £37.560. Ex-
penses apportioned to the Industrial depart-
ment show a good improvement. For £27,862
of premiums in 1923 the cost was £29,236;
last year £42,842 cost £31,003 (phis, in each
case, some exes, not departmentalised and
additions to “establishment”). That repre-
sented a reduction in cost of approximately
33 p.c.
During the year 990 shares were sold and
some unpaid calls were got in, so capital
moved from £91,921 to £93,703; but £56,677
of that is represented only by faith, hope
and perhaps charity. That deficit is apart
from whatever is necessary to cover the
actuarial liability under policies in the Ordi-
nary and Industrial branches and the unex-
pired risks in fire, marine, etc. In the latter,
i'or instance, the customary provision (40
p.c. of net premiums—and the co.’s experi-
ence has proved that inadequate for its
risks) calls for £13,472, or £10,668 more
than has been placed in the fund. All in all,
shareholders can see that: there is not very
much of their money left. The assets posi-
tion is a shade worse, but the slide was
nearly stopped:—

It is doubtful if the net tangible assets, which
amounted to £37.026 on December 31, were
more than enough to cover total liabilities
under policies. That is n most unsatisfac-
tory position, and one which the co. should
have investigated by its consulting actuary.
With influential Boards in three States the
co. should be able to command business at n
reasonable cost, and the new year opens with
some favorable indications. If they fail to
materialise very soon this Column expects
a messy condition of things when the actuary
makes his investigations at the end of the
year, even though by that time the assets
column will bo expanded by the new Com-
monwealth Traders’ Co. shares. It is hardly
necessarv to mention that shareholders have
a long wait in front of them: and 7 p.c.

It is indicative of the strength of Howard
Smith that, following the smallest profit since
1915, a half-million of bonus scrip was
issued to shareholders —a 33 p.c. gift. The
co. is a holding concern, although it does odd
jobs as manager and agent which no doubt
bring in an honest penny or more. The
sources of last year’s big profit were—
Australian Steamships, Ltd. (the old Howard Smith
line).
Caledonian Collieries.
Invincible Colliery.
Australian Sugar Co., Ltd.
Brisbane Wharves, Ltd.
Commonwealth Steel Products, Ltd.
Other cos.
Interest from debentures and public securities.
Payment for services as managing agent of some
of the subsidiaries mentioned.
Being a holding co., no information is given
as to the earnings of the subsidiaries. The
co. holds all the shares in Australian Steam-
ships, and there lias been a heavy silence
as to the profits since Howard Smith, Ltd.,
decided to separate its shipping and coal in-
terests. Before the Steamships’ accounts
were retired from the public gaze it had a
paid capital of £839,623, and the rich harvest
of the war years lies beyond that date.
The holding in Caledonian Collieries was
the greater at one time. But since
the movement in 1920, when there
was either a capitalisation of reserves or a
writing up of assets or both, the shipping
interest must have reached the top of the list
of shareholdings, which, at December 31
last, stood in the books at £2,443,109. Just
how much of Australian Steam profits have
gone to its parent it is impossible to say.
Caledonian Collieries carries outside money
and issues an attenuated balance-sheet, anil
the Howard Smith holding is around the
million mark. Invincible Colliery also issues
a curt balance-sheet, but from it and other
interests the returns are of less importance.
Last year profits were within £4OO of the
record of the boom year 1920; but. although
shareholders were given 12 p.e. as against
15 p.c._ on that occasion (last year’s div.
took £15,000 more because of the half-million
capitalisation), reserves got more, there being
now no pref. capital to provide for. Re-
serves at £154.990 are even now substantial
for a holding co., for it isn’t reckless to
assume that Australian Steamships has nor
distributed all its profits. Howard Smith’s
own liquid position was a shade better
1921. 1923. 1924.
Liquid assets .. £747,456 £343.568 £347,716
Liabilities . . 531,032 686,084 674.002
Liquid surplus .. £216,424
Excess liabilities £342,516 £326,286
Last year’s 12 p.e. div. was close to the
profit disclosed, which suggests that there is
a limit to gift issues even in a money-spinner
like this. When the new eo. took over,
more than three-quarters of a million was
produced from one source or another, and
shareholders were given five shares and a
fraction for every one held in the old eo.
This with last year’s half-million of bonus
scrip makes the 10 p.e. a nice thing for old
holders. But that sufficient profits have
been left in Australian Steam and other sub-
sidiaries to make another gift issue possible
at an early date seems unlikely. Some of
Australian Steam’s war harvest may still be
in cold storage, of course, although the big
addition to the parent’s holding from that
source in 1920 should have absorbed most of
it. ' Still the market is satisfied to set
against the possibility of a shrinkage in the
dividend the possibility of gift issues in the
indefinite future, and is therefore content with
a present return of 62 p.e. on the invest-
ment.

This, Australia’s greatest colliery co., is a
Howard-Smith offshoot. Last year profits
showed an improvement of £14,302,
although the figure was still far be-
low the 1921 record of £147,790. In-
formation disclosed by the accounts is con-
fined to the bare statement of the “balance for
the year,” and there is nothing to show wliat
was laid aside for depreciation and amortisa-
tion. Reviewing the balance-sheets since
the Howard-Smith interests took over from
the old Caledonian Coal Co. in 1913, one is
left with the impression that, despite the
enormous scale on which the co. produces and
the assured market it has through Howard-
Smith control, it has not done extraordinarily
well. West Wallsend and Killingworth
(Borehole seam) and Waratah (Burwood
seam) are still good mines, although working
has become more expensive; but the four
Abcrdares (Aberdare, Central, Extended and
South) are the show pits of the North, and
are working seams from which the coal can
be won easily and cheaply. Yet only twice
has the ordinary div. been 10 p.e. and once
12 p.c. (profs, are (i p.c. cum., but partici-
pate with ordinaries up to 8 p.c.). Here is
what the balance-sheets show :

The value placed upon the properties when
the Howard Smith Co. floated the proposi-
tion was far beyond the purchase price (the
capital of the Scottish co. was £350,000) ;
and, although this has not worked to the dis-
advantage of the parent co., it Las not meant
anything fat for individual shareholders.
These at the start were Howard Smith share-
holders. When the Howard Smith Co.
formed Caledonian Collieries. Ltd., it took
all the ords. (600,007) and 152,500 of the
252,500 profs., and 11.-S. shareholders were
allowed 50,000 at par and 50,000 at a premium
of Is. In view of those figures, the 6 and 7
p.c. divs. take on a different color so far
as Howard Smith Co. is concerned. Mean-
time the co. has raised a further £211,795 of
prefs. and £423,592 of ordinaries. What
seems fairly clear is that in addition to that
capital the co. lias been drawing on profits
for equipment and development work. Not
only are Aberdare and Aberdare Ex-
tended much better equipped than when
they were taken over, but Aberdare
Central and Aberdare South have been
opened up and equipped on a simi-
lar scale, and it does not look as though
capital has paid for all of it. At the present
time new electrical winding machinery is
being installed at the latter two mines. When
this is completed they will resume produc-
tion on the big scale that marks all four pits,
which are operating on the thick, easily-
worked seams of the finest coal of its class
in the world.
The 5 p.c. of 1923 is easily understood, as
the four months’ strike on the Maitland field
affected the Cessnock mines, and, although
West Wallsend. Killingworth and Waratah
worked full time, they could not compensate
for the loss of output from the big pits. Last
year's skimpy <i p.c. is more puzzling. De-
velopment. work is practically completed, the
mines are well equipped and should be set-
tling down to give the maximum return. It
is almost unnecessary to state the report pre-
serves a complete silence on these matters.
The co. lias always been silent and has been
credited with hiding a lot. The question is
whether it has hidden as much as was
thought. Certainly production now should be
greater than ever before. Maitland coal is
world-famed and, apart from the assured
market through Howard Smith, commanded
ready sale until strikes lost one market
after another to Australian producers.
With production on a huge scale amortisa-
tion is an important item, and depreciation
no less so. There is no reason to suspect
that the allowance is not sufficient. At Jan.
3 there was £185,573 of liquid and semi-liquid
assets to cover overdraft of £2129 and “credi-
tors. £227,257.” Whether the whole of that
sum represents floating debt and overdraft, or
whether it contains some hidden reserves is,
of course, impossible to say. Rut it may be
suspected. The co. is installing a ecntral
power-house to cost £100,0(X). This is to serve
the four Abcrdares and will save working
expenses. Incidentally, it will permit the eo.
to expand its service to private consumers —
one of its sources of revenue.

Cash purchases and cash sales, plus good
buying, are the secret of the success of
London Stores. At the close of last year’s
accounts, floating debts amounted to _ only
£7705, while debts due to the co. were £8893.
These figures in a balance-sheet total of
£442,405 tell their own story. Last year’s
profit; were very close to the record of the
preceding year. During the period building
was in progress in one part of the co.’s pre-
mises, but, despite that, better business was
done than in any previous year, as gross
profits show: —
1914 .. £47,532 1 1920 .. £95,160

1918 . . 67,740 | 1924 . . 139,436
1919 . . 75,983 | 1925 . . 157,226
Expenses, however, moved up sharply. Last
year they were £107,592, or £18,483 greater
than in the preceding period, add some word
of explanation might have been forthcoming
as to the cause. If expenditure increases at
that rate, profits would soon have to take in
a hole or two in their belt. On the other
hand if it was abnormal for the' period, then
the Board will have a fat sum for appropri-
ation next balance, assuming it can maintain
its other figures.
At the start the co. put nothing into bricks
and mortar, and that was a material factor
in the splendid progress of early years.
Nowadays the item looms large. On Feb. 28
freehold and leasehold were in the books at
£217,794, on which was a mortgage of
£129,000. For a eo. with a capital of
£200,000 to be so heavily interested in pre-
mises means, as a rule, comparatively low
earnings; but in a case of this sort the capi-
tal is deceptive, because it doesn’t, include the
visible reserves and the vastly larger amount
represented by goodwill—an intangible and
untrustworthy asset, of course, but for the
moment very valuable. Also it is recognised
that rising rents have forced many cos. to
purchase freeholds in order to hold their
ground-floor premises. London Stores origi-
nally purchased another site, but when it
managed to secure its present position it
sold the other at a profit of £27.355. A 10-
storeyed building is going up on the new site.

“Book debts” for 1024 included £52,000 bal-
ance of purchase money on the sale of the

ment of that balance accounts for most of
the improvement in the cash position. Good-
will is still in the books at £16,659. The
position is very solid. The mortgage
(£129,000) and trade debts (£7705) are
covered by £203,639 of liquid assets. Net
tangibles amount to £270,341, or 275. for
each £1 share, which is almost double the
amount shown in the first balance-sheet. The
outlook for the current term justifies the
market’s assumption that the 15 p.c. will be
paid, and the new share issue will be a nice

by Carlton and United and one-third by the
Co-op.; H. F. Young, S. J. Morel) and J.
Richardson will join the Board of the Com-
bine. It is understood that brewing opera-
tions will continue unaltered. This and
recent deals give the Combine control over
the trade in the whole of Victoria.
The rise in sterling, in terms of the
dollar, plus the high discount rate on Lon-
don, makes it impossible for Gold Producers’
Assoc., Ltd., to export gold at a profit. But
it has been decided to maintain a skeleton
organisation in case conditions alter. At
the annual meeting in Melbourne, Chairman
Dyason said that in the six years of its life
gold sold, expressed in sovereigns, was
£19,548,988, the net average price obtained
being 235. 11.66 d. and the premium distri-
buted, 3s. 11.46 d. per sovereign. Total
“dividend” was £3,866,045. Discrimination
as to markets had resulted in £380.503 more
being obtained than if the gold had been
shipped to London. The Association’s re-
presentative in “the East” has been recalled.
Finally, it was resolved:—
That in view of the grave disabilities imposed
upon the goldmining industry through the prohibi-
tion of gold exports, the industry is deserving of
specially favorable treatment at the hands of the
Commonwealth Government.
Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd., was formed in Jan.,
1924, but mining did not start until the
following April. The first accounts, to Dec.
31 last, show a debit at P. and L. of
£33,798, which is transferred to prospecting
and development account. Of the total,
mine expenditure amounted to £30,686
(£153 for depreciation), administration exes.,
including £2218 brokerage and formation,
£4956. Ore sold gave £629 and interest and
discount £1215. Paid-up capital is £356,180
with £65,000, purchase price of South leases,
to be satisfied by the allotment of 3250
fully-paid shares. Assets at Dec. 31 were:
Mine property £362,685 (plus the amount at
development account), plant and buildings
£5412. stores and odds and ends £1932,
cash £17.354. The report states that the con-
tract with the London financial house which
provides for advances to the co. up to
£500,000 for the erection of a treatment
plant is expected to be completed at an
early date. A report to March 9 by mine
superintendent Ernest Baits is included. He
holds to his estimate of 1,119,000 tons
averaging 15 p.c. lead and 5.280 z. silver for
each 100 ft. of depth, and reports that _ in
every case where the shafts are deepening
in ore the grade is being more than main-
tained.
* * - * . *
W. H. Corbould has been staying on at
Mount Isa to see the Black Star No. 10
shaft pushed down into the sulphides, and
three shifts have been put on to speed up
the work. Chief Geologist Dunstan has also
been on the field making a report for the
Public Works Commission to decide the
question of early railway construction.
Reckoning only payable ore to 170 ft., re-
serves run to nearly 2,000,000 tons, so there
is little doubt as to his recommendations,
particularly as his first report on the field
was highly favorable. Willie Robinson and
George King were recent visitors to the field
in company with ex-Premier Theodore. The
iformer donated £lOO for local improvement
purposes, which may be a straw that shows
which way the wind is blowing. Anyway,
Corbould sticks to his first opinion of the
field that it is going to be a large profit-
producer.
The visit of King and Robinson during
the worst season of the year was not made
for health reasons. Rumors that the Clark-
Robinson group are likely to be shortly
interested in Isa Mines, Ltd., are borne out
by the arrival of a representative of Geo.
Klug at Isa to sample the co.'s workings
and check its assay plan. Providing these
are right—and Ernest Bails has always pro-
fessed conservatism m all estimates given to
the public—it is practically certain that
this groan will feed the Isa field with all
the capital required for its immediate de-
velopment and ore treatment. As well as
sinking the shafts rapidly the big co. is
putting down several bores, and silver values
are improving in depth. #
Chillagoe (Q.) State Smelters, with two
lead furnaces in blast, treated 4309 tons
ore during February for bullion containing
504 tons lead. 37,4330 z. silver and 115 oz.
gold. In the same period 2451 tons silver-
lead ore was received from the State Mines
at Mungana and 396 tons were purchased,
the latter assaying 14.5 lead and 9.20 z. silver.
The Girofla is supplying the bulk of the ore
from Mungana, but it carries only 9 p.c.
lead and 6oz. of silver, while the expensive
Gady Jane contributed 713 tons worth IS
p.c. lead and 9oz. silver.
» * * *
Mt. Cobalt (Q.) has had a good even
run since operations started in January.
Plentiful rain and freedom from milling
trouble have ensured this. For February
85 tons concentrates were obtained, carrying
over 22 tons metallic cobalt. The output
for March will considerably exceed this, as
extra men have been put on. Prospects can
be considered fairly good. The north level
at 212 ft. has opened up a good lens of milling
ore, but the south is cutting through non-
payable dirt at present. To test the 2r-tt.
northern shoot underfoot, a winze has .lust
been started. The co. is said to have had
difficulty in marketing its concentrates, but
the fact that hands have been increased to
around 130 skittles that report.
* * * *
At Wiluna (W.A.) A. H. Collier’s Lon-
don syndicate, in which several big Kal-
goorlie cos. are interested, is sinking as fast
as possible on Gwalia Consolidated, and
hopes soon to get down and confirm the
attractive results obtained by the bore last
year. Meanwhile, in expectation of success
attending the syndicate’s operations, and a
big flotation following, Adelaide is either
shepherding or looking for something to
gamble on. Already the surrounding coun-
try has been pegged, and substantial deposits
plus large share interests are being impu-
dently asked for blocks that have nothing
in sight or prospects just sufficient to string
the public on. The usual invasion of hard-
up cos. with loads of forfeited or reserved
shares to place is tipped to start directly
some market interest can be worked up in
the field. * * *
A recent aboriginal discovery of alluvial
gold near Hall’s Creek (W.A.) recalls
memories of the Kimberley rush in 1886. A
year or two previously then Government
Geologist Hardman visited Kimberley and
recommended that a search be made for gold.
Steps were taken to form a prospecting party,
and the Leg. Council placed £lOOO on the
estimates “to be expended for discovery of
a goldfield.” A result was that late in 1885
an Eastern States party led by Hall and
Slattery went to Kimberley, found gold and
caused a rush in which few were successful
and many failed. Later on the question as
to who was the discoverer of the field arose.
Carr Boyd put in a claim, but it was dis-
allowed, and an award of £5OO made to
Hall and Slattery’s party. Although fall-
ing far short of expectations, Kimberley
served an excellent purpose. It proved that
Westralia had prospects of becoming a gold-
producing country; and this paved the way
for the discovery of bigger fields.
* * * »
As outside capital hasn’t the pluck, some
local money is being found to re-open the
old Edna May mines at Westonia (W.A.L
In the space of a few years over a milion ster-
ling was won from this little and now almost
deserted goldfield, and, although ridiculed by
some experts, the handful of battlers left
there have faith in the future, and believe
they will do well. Considerable reserves cer-
tainly exist in the old workings of the Edna
May group, and some of the surrounding
claims have prospects.
* * * *
A wholesale resurrection of the dead is
predicted if Westralia gets the gold bonus.
The Lancefield. at Laverton, is mentioped as
one big mine that will be brought back to
life, and Fraser’s, at Southern Cross, is
another. Both are now mouldering in their
graves. Lancefield was floated by Hoover
and others in the Westralian boom days,
being then regarded as a big thing. So it
was and still is. but the prohibitive cost of
treating refractory ore ruined the original
co. (which was reconstructed many times),
and though its successors made money for
a while, an unsympathetic arbitration award
ultimately froze them out. Unlike the
Lancefield, Fraser’s is free milling and
paid divs. for years on a small capital. It
was a good show down to 400 ft., but was
well gutted, and is now a series of under-
ground waterholes, around which a few men
are fossicking.
* * * *
The co. having a full till, W. E. Wain-
wright has got permission to get a new shaft
down at the south end of the Broken Hill
South. It will be a massive job, as it is to
go to 130<Jft. and cannot draw upon ore till
below < 00ft., owing to the pitch of the shoots
being in that direction. There will be the
chance lower down to have a shot at the
undeveloped western ore bodies, which
have not been touched save by the drill. The
shaft is to have four compartments, each
Oift. long by 3ft. Sin. wide, so that big
haulage will be possible. All that is said
officially is that the working is to go down ;
in these days it is not usual to give the
shareholder details, even though a few score
thousands may have to be mopped up before
a job is complete. Wain wright really
means to have the south end of the mine
properly equipped before he is out of economi-
cal range of the ore shoots served by his
present group of shafts. With metals high
in the market, funds for the new job won’t
cause a moment’s anxiety, and there will be
no trouble over keeping the quarterly div.
and bonus going.

Adelong Gold Estates (N.S.W.) shows
steady improvement in weekly sluicing yields.
The last four gave 155, 178, 197 and 196
ounces respectively.
Christmas Gift (N.S.W.) cleaned up 424
tons for 3470 z. of £3 gold after a six weeks’
run. The improved crushings have kept
down calls, but dividends are not mentioned.
The outlook has improved in three places.
There is a strong ore-body in the intermediate
level below the 200 ft. on Baulders'on’s lode.
At the s.-e. end of the stope on the lode, a
strong face of slate, hard quartz and galena
is being worked. This trends s.-e. and
downwards. And on the Federal lode the
rising stope west of the main rise shows
2ft. of “good ore,” where crushings are being
broken.
* . «■ * *
The Sutherland Lode Development Co., at
Kiandra (N.S.W.), has at last started at
the right end. R. F. Stone, late of Laloki,
Papua, on assuming the management, at once
installed a shaft pump which had been lying
about the premises, and punched the shaft
down to 74ft. An official circular to share-
holders states: “At this depth the ore body
was 4ft. wide, and a grab sample across the
whole width gave 6oz. Sdwt. gold per ton.”
The reef is underlying to the east, and con-
sequently the manager thinks it is not all
visible in the shaft. A change of country
“consisting of nice-looking blue slate” is
coming in on the western end of the shaft.
The reef was also cut 80ft. north of the shaft,
in a costeen, sft. beneath the surface, where
20in. of stone dollied 2oz. free gold to the ton.
* * * *
Great Britain tin, Emmaville (N.S.W.),
has declared its 102nd dividend of Is., and
it is still on good faces. There are only
10,000 10s. shares to cater for, which is a
great help, of course.
Peak Mines. Cobar (N.S.W.), reports an
improvement in the new winze on the west
lode at a point 37ft. north from the main
west crosscut off the 226 ft. level. Though
the lode stuff in the western half of the winze
is low grade, 21 inches of ore in the eastern
half assayed 88oz. silver and 51-dwt. gold.
Pitching steeply to the south, it is wider and
better in the north end of the winze, where
it goes 1220 z. silver and 7dwt. gold.
Hair-raising things are heard about the
Washington silver-lead show at Moira
(Tas.). The yarn is that No. 1 lode
1100 ft. of surface work has brought to light
a formation sft. to 20ft. wide. A shaft went
down 80ft. in good-grade milling ore. A
tunnel cut the formation; and, while the
soutli drive face is in mineralised stuff not
worth anything milling ore covers the full
face of the north drive. There are five other
runs of ore to develop, the last picked up
being on the crest of the mountain which
gives a home to the other shoots. All that
is asked for at first is a £5OOO mill to be
worked by water power. Then we are to
see the fur fly. A fuss is being made be-
cause some ore has tested well for radio-
crystal purposes: but if the mine is what it
is said to be. why linger on that minute
product?

T. PI. Palmer has been telling the Speck
not only that it has a good mine in the South
Comet (B. 19/3/’25). but that he has the
agency for Beer Soriheimer, the Frankfort
German Jew metal buyers who played in
Elder Smith’s back yard before the Great
War. Palmer thinks the mine has 100,000
tons of ore in sight, and, having had a lot
of experience at junction North in measur-
ing up stopes. he should know. Forty thou-
sand shares have been underwritten at 2s.
each. It doesn’t do to prophesy a lot about
Dundas. for it was pretty well tried in
Wm. Orr’s day, when it came a cropper.
Still, lead then was more like £9 a ton than
the £36 it is now. But if the ore is there
why should it go to Frankfort? Why not
to Pirie?

Latest boring report from the Kuala
Lumpur, Kulampang (F.M.S.). takes stock
of 20 holes bottoming from 21ft. to 58ft.
Three catch the eye with 23. 19 and 15 oz.
Then the figures diminish by steps and
stairs to traces and nil —reducing the aver-
age below a frigid 6oz.
A nice little lot of Tongkah Compounds
changed hands before the news came through
to the office that the suction cutter plant of
the Thompsons was making a better output,
though it is still 20,000 cub. yards short of
the monthly possible. What gave the bulls
pluck was that the grade of the ground has
gone up from below 0.71 b. to over the lib.
mark, which, after all, is the big thing. The
dredge has again stopped to change the
machinery, so the next advice may be that
the 70,000 mark has been reached.

“Plumb Bob” : In order to resuscitate the
old United Service Lodge in Adelaide it was
necessary to assemble at least seven Masons
who were members when the warrant was
surrendered in 1895. Eight were secured,
the youngest being 65 and the eldest 80. The
first item on the agenda paper was the read-
ing of the minutes of the last meeting, held
nearly 30 years ago, and an elder arose to
point out a slight error. After this had been
duly corrected the minutes were confirmed
and the business of the evening proceeded

ment which should be tried by all school
teachers to put the kiddies on their guard
against believing and repeating scandal. In
a recent trial I had a circle of twenty-two
boys standing some ten paces apart, while a
like number of girls formed a similar circle.
A boy and a girl came from their circles
and 1 showed them the following message on
paper: “Jimmy Brown ate four tomatoes
and three oranges for his lunch on Tuesday.”
This message was then passed round the
circle by each child running up and whis-
pering it to the next one. The last child
wrote it down. This is what the boy handed
in: “Mr. Jones had two bananas, two
peaches and two oranges. The girl had:
"Jimmy Brown had four oranges and
four bananas for his breakfast yesterday
morning.” Invariably the girls hand in
greater detail and greater inaccuracies. To
try to trace the changes in the message is
about as futile as trying to locate the origi-
nators of the exaggerations in real scandal.
In the test described above, all the children
had played the game before, and boys and
girls were competing for accuracy. One
school, on its first, trial, twisted the sentence
"The afternoon train has just gone out.” to
"The birds are singing in the trees." How
it was managed Heaven only knows.

“Feng-Shui": A gentleman by the name of
Charles Fort, of Marchmont-street, Russell-
square, London, has written asking for de-
tails of any unusual immigrants into this
country that do not arrive by the ordinary
channels: e.g., showers of fish, frogs, or
other beasts or objects that do not usually
accompany the rainfall even when it pours
cats and dogs. The gentleman has over 50
records of showers of living things, mainly
culled from orthodox scientific journals pub-
lished in America; and as Australia is a
large flat surface almost equal in area to
U.S.A., the chances of similar visitations
here, lie thinks, are large. He instances a
deluge of jelly-fish at Bath, in England, in
1804, and another of snails at Pilton, on the
same island. Ilis somewhat startling theory
is that these living downpours are not earth
denizens at all, but arrive on unknown cur-
rents from other planets; and it the truth
of this could be established there is no reason
why we should not take advantage of the
same currents to settle the question of the
moon’s atmosphere. Saturn’s rings and the
canals on Mars. Beyond an occasional fall
of fish, however. Australia has not recorded
many of these* phenomena: Mr. Fort should
go to China. There the official archives are
full of well-documented accounts of showers
of blood and mud. also of chopsticks, fans
and other objects that arc typically Chinese
in appearance. If the speculative gentleman
is right in his theory, there is a planet some-
where in our solar system which has evolved
a civilisation in many respects similar to the
extremely peculiar civilisation of the China-
man.

“Forebridge” : The Mesopotamian arrack is
unquestionably a devastating fluid (B.

I nominate mescal, distilled by the Mexicans
from pulque, which
is itself a fer-
mented drink made
from the juice of
the American aloe.

who had gone down

be the queerest
craft afloat, a man
named Bruce, with

three kiddies, is
preparing for a

Bourke (N.S.W.).
The boat is built of
kerosene tins, a
tarpaulin, a water-
pipe, a Ford fan,
a bike chain, the
ribs of a motor-car
hood, and a host of
sundries. It is 21 ft.
in length and 4ft.

ler is a screw made
from an old Ford
fan to which plates
have been riveted.
The screw is driven

monument.

“Boronia”: Jazz effects are coming to be

and nowanights it is common to hear the
anguish of the accordion augmented by
some Jimbill who presides over an assort-
ment of noises. At our last “darnee” the
“ ’cordeen” engineer was assisted by a per-
cussion artist who controlled an old kettle-
drum, two cowbells, two discs of fluted iron
for cymbals, a ratchet made of two cotton-
reels and some wire, and a piece of iron for
a triangle. The noise was fearsome; but
the dancers seem to like it, and I heard a
girl declare that it “puts go inter th’ sets.”

"Macquarie”: At Bathurst the other day

“Disulphide”: There were the makings of
a first-class mystery yarn in a recent poison-
ing case near Bendigo. All the inmates of
a farmhouse became ill, and one of them
died. Arsenical poisoning was found to be
responsible; but there were no clues to sug-
gest that anybody wanted to do the house-
hold any harm, and no trace of the purchase
of arsenic. Then it was discovered that
the owner of the house had been similarly ill
before, and always after drinking water
from a certain well. An investigation led to
dead frogs being found in the well, with
traces of arsenic in them. And then it
came out that the well had been lined with
second-hand bricks from a demolished pyrites
works in Bendigo. A coating of cement had
prevented harm until it was eaten away and
the bricks exposed ; then Death struck. The
incident may make other people feel uncom-
fortable. Only 4000 bricks went into the
well; but <BOO,OOO bricks from the pyrites
works have been scattered over the country.
“X2X”: Recent cases of poisoning by
arsenical bricks in Victoria recall that some
years ago a family in a Sydney suburb de-
veloped typical symptoms of arsenic poison-
ing. There were suspicions of foul play
till it was discovered that the wall-paper in
the house contained arsenic in the form of
coloring matter; mould had attacked the
paper and converted the poison into an
easily soluble compound which had been
carried into the family’s food by flies or the,
air itself. A similar outbreak was traced
to the presence of. the poison in a carpet,
chemical changes having resulted in tli'e
compound being loosened from the fibre
and wafted upwards by air-draughts.
“Piriti” : “B.V.E.’s” batch of 300 A.W.L.’s
(B. 26/3/’25) were a mere circumstance
beside the exodus that took place from Sling
Training Camp, Salisbury Plain, on the day
the Armistice was declared. As soon as
the news came through practically every Dig-
ger with any cash at all, and many who
were in the chronic dead-stiff condition of
most of us, made tracks for London, con-
siderably over 100 miles away. Some trav-
elled by train and defied the military Jacks
to put them off; others, less assertive, dis-
covered a new enthusiasm for route-march-
ing and padded the hoof or begged lifts the
whole way. All the signallers’ and ord-
nance store bicycles and motor-cycles mys-
teriously disappeared the same night, and a
lot of the A.S.C. horses were among the
missing, together with their grooms. One
little band of enthusiasts pinched an A.S.C.
motor-waggon and struck out for a train
connection at Salisbury, 20 miles off. Un-
fortunately among the cargo was a barrel
of beer, and the party ended in a ditch, half-
way to their objective, which they subse-
quently reached on foot in time to be
gathered in by a reinforced police patrol. 1
don't know what the official estimate of
A.W.L's was, but it must have been well
over 2000, judging by the number who ap-
peared on parade next morning. They
drifted back in dribs and drabs for weeks
afterwards, as their cash ran out or the
prospect of an early boat home appealed to
them. The clink couldn’t hold them all,
so most escaped reprisals.
“Head Light”: The bottle, accused of so
much evil, has just saved the life of a Mel-
bourne motorist whose car overturned. As
the owner was spilled out the bottle dropped
from his pocket, was pinned in an upright
position as the car crashed over, and acted
as a prop which kept the solid part of the
car body from crushing the prostrate man to
death. But there will be more comfort in
the’incident for Drys than Wets; it was a
lemonade envelope that did the trick.

“Merris”: When our trooper tied up at

appeared into the gloom. The ship’s adjutant

At last the people of Australia have taken their place in the World of Wine •

Australia challenged the wine-growers of Europe, in competition at Wembley
Brewers’ Exhibition in 1924, and v/ith her Orlando Port and Frontignac carried
off the palm as the best wines in those classes exhibited.
Orlando Wines win everywhere be-
cause of their purity, quality, bouquet

“Henry Pannikin”: This was the most ex-
traordinary fluke shot 1 ever saw or heard
of. The Fourth Division were holding the
line at Warneton; headquarters in a very
deep dug-out well behind. At dinner-time
the orderlies prepared the meal on a space
in the open. The diners were just finishing
their soup when a shell planked itself fair
on the table. There was a general mix-up
of crockery, adjutants, orderlies and edibles;
and when the atmosphere cleared there were
a few casualties to attend to. General
Brand, now N.S.W. State Commandant, was
one; he was hit in the face.

"XllX”: In Australian States, N.S.W.
excepted, it is the custom to bury the bodies
of executed criminals in quicklime within
the prison in which they have met their end.
The official idea is that the quicklime causes
the body to disintegrate, so that very soon
after burial practically nothing of it re-
mains. Evidently the official mind knows
little about chemistry, for the action of
quicklime on a corpse is to preserve it rather
than to destroy it. The substance is anliy-
THE HOODOO SEX.
“Sad about Mrs. Jones, isn't it?"
“What, the widow?”
“Yes — missing, and probably murdered.”
“Poor dear. A woman isn't safe these dags, even when
her husband's dead!”
drous calcium oxide: the intense affinity
which this possesses for water in any form
is responsible for the preservative effect, so
that when it comes into contact with the
body it immediately starts to deprive the
tissues of the water in them. The result is
to convert the tissues into a condition some-
what resembling that produced by smoke-
drying, in which state they are likely to
remain almost indefinitely, provided that no
air gains access to them. Crippen, who
murdered his wife in London !•> years ago.
found this out to his cost. After he had
cut. up the murdered woman’s corpse, he
buried portions of it in quicklime underneath
a cellar floor, in the belief that they would
soon be destroyed. Instead, they were in
such a perfect state of preservation when
dug up months later that a doctor was able
to identify them by the scar of an opera-
tion which he had performed on the mur-
dered woman. And so Crippen was hanged,
a victim to an imperfect knowledge of chemi-
cal reactions.

“Rata”: “A.J.M.’s” fatalist who took no
chances w i tli his
beer reminds me of
anot h e r of the
tribe. We were
waiting for the
Bondi tram, and l
remarked on the
narrow escape of a
man who has
evaded a motor-
'car by half an inch.
"No,” said Mug-
son, “there was no
real risk there. It
was not his turn.
Whatever will be
will be. Man can-
not, escape his
fate.” Just then
our tram came
along, and I jumped
for the smoker. 1
heard a shout, and
sawMugson tangled
up with a lorry. He
joined me a minute
lat e r, off his
guard. "The near-
est thing in my
life,” he announced.
“If I hadn't dodged
smartly I’d have
been a goner." "But.
fate” 1 began.
"Damn fate,”, said
the shaken Mug-
son. "I'll see' that,
the police get that
man. He’s no right
to drive round try-
ing to kill people!”
And in time of
stress I find most
fatalists feel like
that.
“Macann”: There was one kind of deser-
tion which, although a military crime,
didn't leave much of a stain on the A.l.h.s
record —desertion to get into active service.
It was most prevalent in the early stag'es
of tlie war, especially in the
Gallipoli campaign, when scores
of youngsters, kept out of the
disturbance to look after horses
in Egypt, stowed away in trans-
ports going to Anzac. One chap
I knew made a habit of it. Desert-
ing from hospital in Enoggera
(Q.) to get away with the first
division, he was discovered on
the boat and forgiven. An in-
jured leg prevented his appear-
ance on parades, and in Mel-
bourne he was sent to hospital
again. He took no risks that
time, and the transport was well
out from Westralia before he
came to light. He was not
among the sections of his ammu-
nition column selected for the
first hop-over at Gallipoli, but
he emerged from the stokehold
to go ashore with them at
Lemnos. Off Anzac he walked
down a gangway on to a de-
stroyer loaded with infantry-
men, and was ashore not lons
after the Landing. Sent back
that afternoon he returned with
the transport to Egypt, but
joined some Bth Battalion rein-
forcements and got to Gallipoli
again. His artillery leggings
gave the game away, and the
battalion C.O. told him to “get
to hell out. of this.” But a much
under-staffed ammunition officer
took him on to his strength, and
after a term with the 7th Bat-
tery he was knocked in the Lone
Pine argument. From Monte
Video (.vmg.) he nut himself on
the strength of a transport go-
ing to Egypt and travelled from
there, again sub rosa, to France.
Wounded the second time, he
cleared out from England lo
join his unit in the line.’ Then the war ended
and a fed up C.O. sent him to Australia on
1914 leave.

“Lex”: Governor Murray, after a _ rest
and health holiday in N. S. Wales,
is returning to his kingdom m Papua.
It is far from Port' Moresby to Red-
fern, and the scantily-clad maidens of
the land of cocoanut oil have little in
common with the Doreens of the boot and
shirt factories. Yet Herbert Murray, way
back in the ’nineties, was the diligent appren-
tice who drew up their charter of liberties
—the first Factory Act. He sweated at it
in the chambers then occupied in Richmond-
terrace by the Parliamentary Draftsman to
whom he was assistant. Murray made a
good job of it; and, though time has neces-
sitated amendment after amendment, his
principal act is, nevertheless, the foundation
of the State’s factories legislation. He
found relief from the labor in French novels
and kept his body in good form at the fenc-
ing school. The Doreens might at least have
sent him off with a bale of cotton shirts.
PUTTING HIM IN HIS PLACE.
"Have you anything for the skin, please?"
"Ah, madam, something to make yon beautiful?"
"Certainly not! Something to make me more beautiful."
“Class B” : The Education Department is
always considering new ways to make school
attractive to the Victorian youngster; but
it never struck anything so successful as a
scheme developed the other day in a sub-
urban school. A muscular woman arrived
and, having handed her baby to a girl, ‘"went
for” the headmaster, explaining hotly whilst
she smashed his glasses over his nose that
it was repayment for a strapping adminis-
tered to her boy when he had declined to take
the cane. An assistant who made an effort
to interfere on behalf of the embarrassed
head was warned to keep himself to himself
or expect something similar; and the
assaulted dominie finally had to seek refuge
in flight. It was a deplorable incident, of
course; but lots of those youngsters now
see in school possibilities they never saw
before.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: A legal point was raised by
defending counsel in a Melbourne court last
week. A young man was sentenced to im-
prisonment, but released on liis bond to be
of good behavior for two years. He failed
to keep his undertaking, becoming involved
with the Law in N. S. Wales and doing a
“stretch” of 12 months. When he turned
up in Melbourne again the police nabbed him
promptl v on a charge of having broken his
bond. His plea was that the ill behavior
having occurred in another State it didn’t
count: but Knight, P.M., remarked that,
though the point was interesting, the offender
would have to go in first and appeal after-
wards. So the matter rests with the
prisoner and his friends, unless the Burglars’
Protection Society should feel inclined to
take the matter up.
"FY7”: The company which is now run-
ning the one-time N.S.W. State trawlers
has installed wireless telephones on its
boats. From his office the manager can
ring up, find out how and what the catch is
and, if necessary, take measures to prevent
a market glut, or indicate what particular
brand of fish is likely to be in demand.
It would seem only a short step to the in-
stitution of a mail-order service Direct from
Trawl to Table (slogan suggestion copy-
right). The office could ring up its customers
advising a choice line just up in the last
trawl and book orders. These could be
carried from the trawler to the depot by
trained seagulls, or perhaps flying-fish. The
Southern latitudes might tell against these
last in winter, but they could be supplied
with flannel jackets and kept in the engine-
room till required. I’ve seen a lot of in-
surance-company prospectuses of late that
don’t read half as attractive as that.
“Nakhoda”: He came up out of the
greeny-grey water like an enormous bronze
moon rising through mist. After his various
doors and windows had been unscrewed and
the headpiece turned back, he disclosed to
Binks and me—we had paused on the ferry
pontoon on our way to work —a very red
face patched with a ver l ' white moustache
and surmounted by a skull almost as
bronzed and shining as his divers’ head-
dress. "Y’ wouldn’t expect to meet a shark
up here in Circular Quay,” he said casually,
“but one met me jus’ now. Jus’ as I was
cornin’ up. Saw ’im shadowy out of the back
of me head. ’E kept makin’ big sweeps
across astern of me, an’ every time ’e got
a bit pluckier an’ ’is ugly-lookin’ ’ead come
plainer. I wanted to finish the job I was on
to save goin’ down again, so I jus’ kep’ one
eye on ’im until I reckoned the next rush
would bring ’im within shootin’ distahee.
You know- —advice to the young ’unter —fire
when you see the green in ’is eye. Then 1
jus’ wriggled me little finger up me wrist-
band and let the air go—that’s ow it s
done. It struck ’im in the teeth like a bar
of iron—you never saw a shark so sur-
prised in ' ycr life. I guess he’ll stick to
frightenin’ female bathers at Manly and
Coogee before lie’ll come playin' tricks with
a diver again,” and he signalled to his hat-
man to bring him his pipe. "My hat!”
shouted Binks to me as he twisted his
fragile body out of the way of a bellowing
motor-car, skilfully defeated tlie bloody de-
signs of a lorry and hopped across the foam-
ing cutwater of a tram on to the opposite
side,walk of Circular Quay—"some chaps
lead dangerous lives!”
* * * *
“Centurion”: A blithe and unrepentant
sinner went joyously from a Sydney police
court: the other day to serve a sentence of
a year and a month additional to one lie was
already working off. He had been passing
himself off in the suburbs as a wireless in-
spector and fining conscience-stricken radio
pirates—or anyone else: —as much as lie
thought they were good for. The job that
seemed to give him most pleasure was one
worked on a suburban electrician. “Yes,”
be confessed, “I fined that joker 2s. fid. for
not notifying his change of address. I ought
to have fined him £3.” Asked if lie, had any-
thing to say before sentence, the "inspector”
desired that his electrician client might be
informed that he himself was now changing
his address without paying even 2s. fid. for it.

"Hasen”: In these dog-days, when coun-
tesses and generals and mysterious “A's” and
“B's” have lost interest, the Melbourne
papers found copy in the proposal to remove
sundry palms from St. Kilda-road during
the erection of electric poles by the Tram-
way Board. Yet, despite hysterical shrieks
about vandals, tub-thumpings by municipal
bigwigs and grave words by the omnipresent
James Barrett, Mr. and Mrs. Melbourne just
went on with their dinner and took the kids
to the pictures as usual. Perhaps they
realised that no artistic damage was being-
done. Much of the beauty in any collection
of trees, be it natural forest or man-made
avenue, lies in the inviting distances to be
seen through them, in the vistas revealed;
and this applies with greater force to the
long, straight avenues of approach to a city.
The vandalism that has already taken place
TALKED TO DEATH.
“We do ‘most everything by electricity in
the States; why, even our condemned
criminals”
“Yes, I've heard you kill ’em by elocution."
lias, by the removal of obstructing and
rather scraggy palms between really fine
trees, opened up just such pleasing and
attractive vistas, hitherto concealed. It is
no longer a case of not being able to see the
wood for the palms, and the wood turns out
to be well worth seeing. Which is perhaps
why the public stayed away in enormous
numbers from the protest meeting held in St.
Kilda-road. The attendance was estimated
at "about 30 people,” and several of these,
of course, were reporters and press pho-
tographers, and more were Tramway Board
and Council employees—the vandals them-
selves. A mouse could make a more hearty
protest.

The Speck's only obviously-Scotch poli-
, tician, Alex. Hean, is giving the forthcom-
ing elections (June 3) a miss. No reason
is publicly offered, but as the astute Mean
is the most inveterate office-catcher in the
island it may be taken as certain that he
regards his party (Nat.) as unlikely to ob-
tain a majority at the coming elections.
During his 22 years of political life he has

held Ministerial or other paid office for
nearly 20. The State has probably
paid him more than £15,000 for services
rendered, and as his farm in the prolific
Sorell district has never been idle, the
chances are that he has saved at least
£14,990. In the Assembly lobbies lie will be
much missed, as he was generally admitted
to be the best raconteur there.
A Vic. hamlet with a population of 150

Senator, W. A. Gibbs, elected bv the N.S.W.
Parliament to fill the seat of the late Jack
Power, who died seven weeks after taking
Allan Macdougall’s place. Gibbs had his
first yell at Yan Yean 47 years ago. He
mined in the S’African quarrel as a Vic.
Bushman, worked as a miner at Cobar
(N.S.W.) for seven years, landed with the
rest at Gallipoli, and was sent back wounded
in June, 1916; then he joined the A.L.P.
staff, and has been assistant sec. ever since.
He was unsuccessful against Mark Morton
for Allowrie in 1917, and also missed the
bus for St. George three years later. In
Labor circles he is known as a conscien-
tious worker who hasn’t got a limelight
apparatus.
Arthur Robinson, ex-Vic. Attorney-
General, has described his appointment as
a director of the Ford Manufacturing Co.
of Aus. (Geelong) as a “pleasant surprise.”
He must be getting used to pleasant sur-
prises by this time; certainly he has had

Lppuh Chambah followed. Then came the
virtual control of the House of Landlords
for six years and a K.C.M.G.-ship. The fas-
cination of politics was never such as to
make him forget bis own lucrative legal
business. Now he is apparently heading for
million airedom, membership of the House
of Commons, a castle in Britain, and a
baronetcy.
Luborites hope that George Hooper, who
again has the nomination for East Mel-
bourne, in which he failed by only 121 votes
last election, will bring a new seat into
Labor’s possession on the next occasion. The
argument is that if St. Hilda bad been
contested East Melbourne would have been
won. In Victoria the property-owner may vote
either in his own electorate as a resident or
in the place where lie owns property, and
187 St. Hilda people, Eggleston having been
given a walkover in the seaside place, voted
in East Melbourne, mainly for Farthing,
M.L.A. This time Laborites will see that
Eggleston is opposed. Hooper, incidentally,
is an example of the queer importance of
football in Melbourne. It was as a foot-
ball club committeeman of considerable zeal
that he first became known. That fame got
him into civil politics; and his popularity as
an alderman will help him in his political
campaign better than his speaking, which is
poor. ;
Joe Timms, the Adelaide contractor whose
name has been associated with so many big
public works, has called together his credi-
tors following his failure to complete the
Thousand Homes contract for the S.A. Labor
Government. Timms has handled big money
in his time. Starting as a navvy in his
’teens lie became a contractor at 22. Associ-
ated with the late Teesdale Smith in the con-
struction of the Nairne to Bordertown rail-
way, with Smith and Baxter in the building
of_ the Oodnadatta line, and with Sidney
Kidman, Timms’s name became almost a
household word in Australia. His last big
job prior to that of the Thousand Homes was*
the Lake Victoria dam, in connection with
the locking scheme of the Murray, but hgrre
he lost money. He was the owner at one
time or another of valuable Adelaide pro-
perty, including the Imperial Hotel, King
William-street, which he sold in March last
year for £86,000; and he was also interested
in squatting and in the Narbethong (Vic.)
sawmills.
“lan C.”: While the delegates to the
A.N.A. Conference. at Ballarat listened to
the debate on their organisation's finances
they munched apples supplied by the local
branches. Peacock, State Treasurer, watched
them with interest, and wondered whether it
would be a good idea to place of fruit
oil the green benches of the Assembly on Bud-
get day. Some of. us recalled that Oscar
Asche, when nbiying the melancholy Jaques
in “As You Like It,” bit and' chewed an
apple while discoursing on. the seven ages

More than 40 years of it hjas been spent in

committee of the old weatjher-stained Hyde
Park church—the building itself more than
half a century old —is arranging to commem-
orate the event on June 1$ Mr. Walters’s

The widow of J. Fred. Hayward, whose
career as a S. Aus. pastorajist dates back to

Hayward, who died there in 1912, in his

those mighty S. Aus. squafiters, the brothers
Dr. W. J. and Dr. J. Harris Browne;
he himself owned among other stations
Arvona in S.A., and had a proprietary
interest in the famous Canowie Estate.
He married in 1864 Ellen, youngest
daughter of the late Capt. 0. W. Litchfield,
Chief Inspector of Police in S. Aus., and
shortly afterwards retired to live in England.

this decoration—a D.C.M. gained with the
first contingent at Gallipoli—he received £5O
from brewery-owner A. Lanfear. He was
invalided home with a shattered leg; but it
mended so satisfactorily that he again passed
the M.O. and returned to have another lick
with the boys in France. South Africa had
given him a previous taste of it.
Anyone who has knocked around the wild
strait between the South and North islands
of Maoriland in stout deep-keelers with
double skins will appreciate the feat of W.
G. Harding and his two sons, of Wellington,
who recently took a 15-foot canvas canoe
from Masterton down the rapids of the
Waipoua and Ruamahunga rivers into
Bakes Wairarapa and Onake, and thence
tried to reach Wellington by sea. The 85-
mile journey was done in three days, and the
much-holed craft was within a mile of the
treacherous Wellington Heads when a shift
of wind forced the navigators to land
through the surf on to the rocky coast. A
battered canoe finished the cruise by lorry
and the argonauts walked home; but they
had put a feather in the cap of the Royal
Port Nicholson Yacht Club, to which they
belong.
Next season Vk Uppah Chambah will
have to do without T. H. Payne, one of its
soundest members, as he is off for another
trip to the Cold Land with a section of his
family. Three years ago, when the trien-
nial election was on, he was across the sea,
and a South Melbourne baker nominated
against him. But the breadmaker was in-
duced by Payne’s friends to withdraw, and
the old member got the walkover to which he
had become accustomed since 1904. He
is one of the wealthy members of the House,
and loathed public life when he forced him-
self into it; but he takes to it more kindly
now.
11. J. Carter, 8.A., and Fellow of the
Entomological Society, the newly-elected
president of the Linnean Society, will bring
to his new office a fame in learned circles
which comes from 33 years of scientific
research, most of it in connection with Aus-
tralian insects. English by birth, he came
here from Cambridge 43 years ago, and has
taught at Sydney Grammar for 20. Like
many other learned men, his name is
scarcely known outside scientific circles, but
within them he is regarded as Australia’s
foremost bug expert.

The appointment of G. Oliver Smith,
B.M.E, (Melb.), B.Sc. (Tas.), as ‘City
Engineer of Hobart (rice Bellamy who has
gone to a big water and sewerage job in
South Aus.), is notable, if only for the
fact that he is j:he first Tasmanian native
to be handed the job—on probation for six
months in this case. In past years Bumble-
dom has practically insisted that the City
Engineer should be an outsider, even if (as
actually happened in some cases) he came
from some small county town of the main-
land. Apart from engineering and public-
health qualifications, Smith lias been man-
ager of more than one mine, has been lecturer
and examiner at the Hobart Technical
school, and has acted as State Government
analyst for six months. As a final qualifica-
tion he has already spent 17 years as
Assistant Engineer. Ilis wife is quite cap-
able of giving him a hand —she is a B.Sc.,
too.

P/§>y
Unlike other fumigants, the fumes of CALCIUM CYANIDE
;ire not generated outside the warren and then blown in.
That way the fumes would quickly be absorbed by the soil.
No, CALCIUM CYANIDE is blown in in the form of dust.
The fumes are then instantly generated and last for at least
twenty-four hours. Every opening is indicated by a dust-
cloud. No rabbit can escape, however deep the dead-ends.
The dust is heavy and goes to the bottom, the gas is light
and rises into dead-ends.
The Fumo Dust Blower has been de-
signed for the application of CALCIUM
CYANIDE as the result of twelve months’
experience. It is strong, simple and
convenient. The supply of dust is under
direct control and can be completely
shut off if desired.

"I p Top’’: Some N.Q. tribes are certain
that ghosts cannot cross water. So when a member
passes west they shift camp across a river, imme-
diately after having disposed of the body in such
a way as will be pleasing to its ghost. Several
tribes go to extremes to prevent the spirit’s unwel-
come attentions. After planting the body they blaze
the trees in a circle around it. When the ghost
hops out of the grave ami chase.'
his retiring friends lie’ll follow
the tree-marks and never reach
anywhere at all. To be dead-cer-
tain they jamb coals in the dead
man’s ears before planting - him,
which keeps the ghost encased for
a considerable time. They also
light fires around the spot, prefer-
ably in trees, because the ghost
will surely delay his pursuit to
warm himself. Then to make a
racecourse certainty of it the whole
tribe go for the lick of their
lives for the nearest river. Sortie
tribes spike the ghost’s wheel in
this way; they cut off the corpse's
head, roast it and smash the skill!
to bits, leaving tiie remnants in
the tire. When the ghost hops from
the grave lie misses his head an i
gropes blindly about until he
burns his fingers in the coals, an l
is then jolly glad to duck back
into his six-by-two. Yet other
tribes smash the bones of a dead
fnau’s body, and weigh it down
with heavy stones before finallv
covering it. This all helps to
keep the ghost underground as
long as possible. But the nigs
always take care to leave plenty
of tuqker close by the grave for
the ghost’s breakfast. Otherwise
he’d get into a fury and break
tilings. Although the burial cus-
toms differ much, the reincarna-
tion belief is universal. The ghost
wanders for a time upon the tribal
hunting-grounds, then, becoming
lonely, hops off to the spirits'
waiting-room, and in such congenial company “walks
about’ until his time comes to be born on earth
again All niggers that are “civilised” explain
the dving-out of their race by the fact that “black
man he die. Jump up quick-fella white fella.”
“Werrimee”: As a variant to long-distance
droving, how is this for a record? In 1916 a drover
named Shepherd left Manfred (Q.) with 8000
wethers, to wander up and down stock routes for
teed, until rain replenished their own bare run.
rheie wasn t very much on the stock routes, but it
was the only sustenance to be had. All the drover
had to do was to keep on feed of some sort, and
study maps. As the jumbucks were “travelling
sbeep,” however, he had to put six miles between his
night camps. During their travels the sheep were
shorn twice. After 18 months’ wandering, Shepherd
returned to Manfred with 6600.
"Centre”: "Jesmond” rings the bell (B.
12/3/’25) when he says that “adobe houses require
a dry climate.” The old adobe churches and houses
of Mexico would never have stood for hundreds of
years but for the fact that they were built in coun-
try as dry as the desert. They need no dampeourse
or cement foundations there to prevert the walls
from crumbling. The only foundations they have
are simply the adobe rammed hard into trenches from
THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
LOCAL PREACHER (an engined river): “Special service will
be held nets' Sunday afternoon at 2.30 p.m., when short
addresses will be delivered by the Salvation cap’n and.
the Baptis' minister. We ’ope all av ’ce will roll
up, an' moorc, too, for when Salvation fire and. Baptis'
water do get together 't edden goin' be long before
steam is up.”
which the walls -rise. The only treatment the
walls receive is a wash over, fairly frequently, of
liquid cow manure. Earth-floor and walls get this
alike, it being a capital disinfectant, as Indians
and South African natives well know. The more
imposing of the Mexican adobe buildings have an
outer coating of white lime-wash; this acts as a
preservative against the weather, and inside adds
considerably to the light. 1 know a man in Queens-
land who built an adobe house, of four rooms, over
30 years ago, and has lived in it ever since. That
house stands in a. healthy and dust-dry country. My
brother built one 10 years ago, and now there : s
only a low mound of grass-grown earth, lie built
close to a Queensland river, near the coast —a site
absolutely unsuitable for adobe.
. “ILF.”: The canniest cocky I know is
a well to-do farmer in Gippsland (Vic.). In the
moulting season he assists Nature by plucking feathers
from his chooks, and as Ids birds are numbered by
the hundred he sells a large quantity of feathers
each year. He is known in the district as “the man
who shears his fowls.” He also frequently inspects
all his barb-wire fences for wool held fast by the
barbs when the jumbucks have been in contact.
Once he had two sows farrow at the same time:
one he styed, the other was allowed to select her
own nest. A fox got all the piglets in the paddock,
and the remaining litter was divided between the
two sows. Result, 10 prime porkers ready for
market in jig time.
"Yamim”: The best damper ever I had
was made by a woman in whose house 1 lodged
when skulldriving handy to Gundagai (N.S.W.).
Both the hubby and l loved damper, and when we
kept the firewood well up to the missus, and she
was in a good humor, she? obliged. The gift—it is
a gift—must have been inherited, as her dad was a
champion at the? game. Yet some say tliat a woman
can’t make a decent damper.
* * * *
"Wandi”: The largest pelican rookery I
have come across was in Cawudilla Lake, out from
the Darling River. An island in that lake, 50yds.
wide and half a mile long, in favorable seasons was
covered with nests, placed about a yard apart.
The nests were shallow depressions scraped in the
sand, and scantily lined with wood and
other local material. The eggs, three or
four in a nest, made the island loos
as if it was strewn with snowballs. When
one lot had finished nesting, another lot occupied
tlie ground. Large numbers of swans and ducks
nested in the surroundings, whilst in the trees
that stood in shallow water were numerous nests of
cormorants, egrets and pink-eared ducks. After
flood rains had filled Cawndilla Lake, scores of
thousands of pelicans made their home there for
months at a time. Such a host, with the multitudes
of cormorants, made a tremendous drain on the
fish supply, and when the breeding season was over
their depleted store compelled them to scatter far
and wide.
Country Ped : I have heard of persons
using a motor-car to muster sheep, but surely the
limit was reached in Vic. when four men in a car
drove a mob of 50 along a three-chain road into
the market town. It is almost needless to add that
every man was fat.
* * * *
"Top Rail : Bees, like the Communist
brethren, hate nothing so much as sweat, particularly
the sweat of horses. Even tne
honey-gatherers, usually in a
hurry to get their job over,
will fly half a mile off their
beat to ease their fury on a
sweating Dobbin ; and most,
selectors who keep a hive or
i wo take care not to have them

worked. A Bumbury (N.S.W.I
tanner received an unforger-
table lesson on this subject

"8.X.W.”: Weird are
the shapes Nature has given
to alluvial, goltl nuggets. At
Kurnalpi (W.A.), Con Murpliv
picked from his shaker a nug-
get about three-quarters of an
ounce which was a really anuH
ing represc ntation of a swan,
curved neck and all. Bissengcr,
of Bulong, had a flat nugget
about an ounce in weight
which was a map of Australia.
Herald Stockfeld obtained a
half-ounce piece the facsimile
of a four-rooted molar tooth,
the top grinding surface hav-
ing: a slight hollow as if deeav
had set in. My own trophy
was a gold grub or caterpillar
inside a broken quartz crystal.
A remarkable feature of the
W.A. alluvial-gold areas was
tlie almost unfailing pre-ence
of obsidian bombs, pear-shaped
and indented like a blane-mange mould, in all prob-
ability of meteoric origin.
“T.Iv.T.”: My experience is that the
female abo. can endure thirst better than the male.
In the dry season Central Australian blacks keep
about the wells in the sandy country, where it s
easier to obtain food. As a rule, these wells last
from wet to wet, but sometimes there is a drought,
and then trouble comes. The nigs hang on as long as
they can, but in the end they are forced to break
for a. permanent water, anything up to IfiO miles
away. Perhaps they have let the supply get too low
to fill their kangaroo-hide bags. Perhaps there are
no bags. Anyhow, hampered with children and old

and,in each ease it was a young woman who staggered
in first to take water back. When 1 have had boys

THREE POOR MARINERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H c be three poor mariners, we be three poor mariners,
Xewly come from the seas,
While others live at ease.
Shall we yo dance the round, the round , the round,
Shall we <jo dance the round, the round, the round!
Ike Warren’s boat was o’er the bank
With freight from Twofold Bay ;
In Lizzie David’s pub we drank
•'n I yarned the hours away,
\\ hile little waves rose up and sank
Like dolphins at their play.
Ay, Charlie Scott and lj<e between,
Upon a beer ease I
Forget the sorrows that have been,
Bade present Care pass by
And let blue sea and landscape green
Bewitch my lazy eye.
A patron saint of sailormen
John Barleycorn is he;
We paid him tribute now and then—
Lang syne it was since we,
Withheld by thrall of ship and pen,
Had met so happily.
The hills of Nadgee floated far,
In amethystine haze;
And, like a trained church choir, the bar
Pursued its hymn of praise,
While in dull, organ notes afar
Old Ocean droned the bass.
A breath of salt and seaweed blew
Along the Gippsland main;
The wind-tossed gums, and wattles, too,
Beneath their feet again
Their white and golden Spring frocks threw
Like dryads in disdain.
’Mid noiseless rain of finished flowers,
And lake tides lapping low,
We heeded not the passing hours,
We let our. troubles go—
It is not oft kind Fortune dowers
Three friendly fellows so.
THE UNEMPLOYED PROBLEM IN MELBOURNE.
"'Ow arc things now, Bill?”
“No good. Rheumatics. Doubt if I’ll hever be able to
do a honest dag’s 'eldin'-up again.”
Though friends I have of high uptrend,
And friends of humbler lot,
Though all the world might be my friend —
Which all the world is aot—
Among my mates until tile end
Stand Ike and Charlie Scott.
As hard as nails, but soft as dough
To any tearful tale,
Two good old coastal salts who know
The trick of helm and sail,
Who, spite what wicked winds may blow,
Year after year, prevail.
John Barleycorn, John Barleycorn,
Your sly, soft ways I ken!
But still you warmed, ere I was born.
The oft-chilled hearts of men ;
With wings of thought, at eve or morn,
You sometimes tip the pen.
No doubt through you our fall from grace
When Charlie on the floor
Stood up to sing, with sea-boot face,
The words of “Shanandore”;
Its ribald chorus through the place
Re-echoed with a roar.
But, as the good old chanteys rang,
And loud and louder grew
Each sea refrain, with thump and clang
That helped the chorus through,
I told my soul, “Let care go hang,
’Tis only Truth is true!”
l or three poor mariners are we;
While others live at case.
We sail whatever ports we see
O’er Life’s uncertain seas;
It is not oft a man may be
With honest friends like those.
These were my thoughts as on the floor
We danced the joyous round—
Three manners, some blokes from shore,
A sunny day around,
And each of us for evermore
Upon the outward bound.
These were my thoughts; and who arc you
Would tell me it was wrong
When all the snarling seas were blue—
Leashed dogs upon a, thong—
And Charlie Scott to see us through
IVith sailor dance and song?
Uor three poor mariners arc we;
While others live at ease,
One cm land and two at sea
Wo toil without surcease,
That all our freights delivered be
On Life’s uncertain quays.
Yea. three poor mariners re-met
In passing middle age,
With tales to tell and throats to'wet;
And though the Pecksniffs rage,
We’ll drain a cup of kindness yet
Our sorrows to assuage.
And we will dance the round, the round
Upon the taproom floor,
And sing our song of “Homeward Bound”
And deep-sea songs galore;
Ay, we will dance the round, the round,
And fill ’em up once more.

GENUINE BALLOON TIRES
STANDARD EQUIPMENT
u

a
r\
Greatest Ifelzie HUDSONBverOHeredf
The 7 Passenger
Phaeton
Hudson’s consistent leadership in value is emphasized again in the
adoption of genuine balloon tires as standard equipment on all models.
Do not confuse with “semi-balloon” types. Hudson’s are genuine
balloon tires. Compare the difference. Also note that Hudson has
not simply “added balloon tires.” Both running and steering gear
have been specially designed for the radical differences balloon tires
bring. The result is the easiest steering and riding Hudson ever built.
In All Ways a Finer SUPER-SIX
Note that in Hudson this costlier tire
equipment is not reflected in the price.
It merely adds another factor of con-
trast to Hudson’s advantage of low cost
among fine quality cars.
Of course, as always, Hudson’s chief
advantage is in the superiority of me-
chanical design and construction.
In speed, acceleration, hill-climbing and
endurance it holds marks that are
famous among all stock cars. Many of
its official records have never been
equalled by any car regardless of price.
In this territory, as elsewhere through-
out the world, the great number of
Hudsons you see in service is the best
proof of the value and satisfaction they
consistently render. Greater fuel and
oil mileage, exceptionally low cost for
replacement parts, and easy accessibil-
ity give the new Hudson remarkable
economy of maintenance and operation.
And the position of its builders —the
sixth largest producer of cars in the
world —assures the standard of quality
you may expect, as well as the acknowl-
edged policy of satisfaction to owners,
that stand back of the Hudson Super-Six.

“Larrapinta”: I can’t say whether the
weight, oi 9141 b. carried 70 miles by Tagh Mahomet’s
camel (B. 12/3/’25) is a record, but I hope it is.
The poor brutes get enough ill-treatment in the
hands of Asiatic drivers without being compelled to
carry weights like that. Any bushman who has been
along the Maree-Alice Springs, Birdsville or Inna-
mincka tracks can bear witness to the way these
fiends ill-use their camels, and the horrible sores
which result. I once saw a bull camel reared on
Beltana station (S.A.) cany 12cwt. two miles at
Maree in order to settle a bet. If those
concerned in the senseless business had been forced
to hump a bag of wheat each over the same distance
they might understand what the camel thought
of the business.
* * « *
“Machete”: Though it was disputed for
a long time, naturalists now seem to be agreed
that there are, as “Alastor” says (B. 26/2/’25),
pure-bred dingoes black or white in color, and these
last not albinos. The real First Dog, represented by
the hunting wild dogs of India and Africa, is invari-
ably red. The dingo is, however, supposed to be
a tame dog that went wild a very long time ago,
and his variations in color may bo due to a mixed
ancestry. The extra molar, referred to by “Alastor,”
is very unusual. The dingo, like all the dogs, has
42 teeth.
* * * *
“Morob” : The abo. “baby-stones” in South
Groperland (B. 1 9 /2/’2 5 ) have a counterpart in some
of the coastal districts of Dutch New Guinea. There,
however, the belief is carried somewhat further, it
being supposed that the stones impart, or at. least
assist, fecundity. Barren women desirous of having
children frequently seek their aid. This is done
by staying in the vicinity of the stones as much
as possible, and even by sitting on them, sometimes
for hours at a stretch. Occasionally sorcerers put
a tabu on the stones for a certain period, the idea
being to prevent enthusiastic dames from giving
a village more mouths than can bo conveniently fed.
# * * *
“Fez”: I learned a lesson in catching bait
from some youngsters at Brunswick Heads
(N.S.W.) the other day. These juve-
niles had a pickle bottle with a string
tied around the neck and a crust of
bread inside. Having coaxed the
small mullet around with the aid of
bread crumbs, the bottle was lowered
into the water. In no time the mullet
were diving in head first, and the bottle
was drawn up and emptied ready for
another catch. As many as half a
dozen small mullet were obtained each
time.
“Iveppel”: The spider is sup-
posed to be the model of perseverance,
but let me say a word for the frog.
Last night I put in a profitable half-
hour watching one attempt to climb
4ft. up a verandah wall to catch a
grasshopper. A heavy shower had
made the newly-painted wall slippery.
The frog would gradually ascend about
18in., and then for all his efforts slip
back. This occurred about a dozen
times. Finally, by a super effort he
managed to get within a few inches of
the grasshopper, which during all this
time had not shifted. Then, creeping
very gradually up the remaining dis-
tance, he made a jump and just man-
Jged to grab the tip of the ’hopper’s
leg. It couldn’t hold on, however, and
the ’hopper sprang away. Nothing de-
terred, the frog turned his attention
to a moth, which alighted close by,
and caught it. The look of satisfaction
on that frog’s face as he clamped his
jaws was almost human.
“Bahmahoota”: “Rita C.” (B. 12/3/’25)
may rightly disagree with “Curlew” (B. 12/2/’25).
The station-manager is known the “trump” ;
never as the “blue tongue.” The shed overseer or
boss of the board is the “red light” ; shed-hands are
“brushy tails,” “lop-ears” or “blue tongues”; the
cook is the “babbler” ; his offsider or assistant is
“slushy”; and a station-hand is a “line ’possum”
or “sheep nurse.” And the engine-driver who blow.-;
the whistle first thing in the morning is whatever
a sleepy wage-slave likes to call him. /
“Curlew”: During 40 years in Central and S.-W.
Queensland I never heard shed-hands called “blue
tongues,” as “Rita C.” (B. 12/3/”25) asserts. They
were always “loppies.” “Ex-Englishman’s” men-
tion of iron quoits (B. 19/3/’25) suggests that
“good iron” derives from that once popular game.
Certainly the words were often employed by spec-
tators to express approval of a good throw. And
I have heard that they were used, too, in the whal-
ing days in reference to a well-planted harpoon.
•.• I •
“J.W.M.”; “Ex-Englishman’s” notion of how the
“ringer” of a shearing shed got the name is very
wide of the mark. Fifty years or more ago a run
was 15 sheep. When the first man caught his 15th
sheep he rang a bell, and naturally the fastest
shearer became known as the “ringer.” In those
days it usually took an hour and 20 minutes for
the run.
“Tarago”: I always thought the spider
was master in his own domain, but he isn’t. Recently I
witnessed a go, Rafferty’s rules, between a big
black specimen and a grasshopper. The vegetarian
started the trouble by bounding into the web ring
and dancing an air jig. Jack Johnson darted from
his curled-leaf dressing-room to the centre of the
ring and clinched. The ’hopper got home two hefty
kicks under the short ribs, and the colored gent,
staggered to his corner to recover his wind. In he
bogged again and literally crawled all over his adver-
sary. He appeared to be trying to turn Hop Harry
on his back, preparatory to putting in the boot; but
in reality he was endeavoring to bind him with a rope
that he had cunningly concealed in his hip pocket.
All the time the other chap kept operating with
heavy lefts and rights, mostly landing below’ the
belt. The pace became fierce. Johrpon secured
a scissors grip, and it looked odds on him, when his
opponent bit him on the face. That was too hot.
Jack rushed to the edge of the ring and, grabbing
a guyrope, jerked it savagely. The ’hopper tumbled
out of the web, groggy but safe, and I presume he
got the decision on a foul. Anyway, Jack retired
to his dressing-room to be patched up by his second,
and to explain to the reporters that he would have
“won easy” if he hadn’t “done his hand.”
* * * *
“Slam”: What is the last word about
these big trees? I -doubt the Californians’ claim
of 470 ft. for their tallest sequoia (a fallen giant
long since removed and cut up), and the Australian
claim of 500 ft. for the loftiest of the Gippsland
trees finds me equally incredulous, though a W.A.
surveyor tells me he actually measured a 537 ft. gum
in the Sandgropcr State. A grey box on a flat north
from Genoa (Vic.) goes 148 ft. to the first branch,
and is considered 450 ft. high. 1 saw another giant,
also in Vie., which yielded 27 lengths of 6ft. palings.
It was cut 12ft. from the ground, and about Oft.
was left below the first limb, making a tot cl of
200 ft. to the first limb. But the tallest trees I
ever saw were not more than 300 or 380 feet,
according to my reckoning, and I’ve been all over
the east coast and seen all the big-timber country.

“Billo”: The Council never mentions
Bunny as a snake-killer; vet Harry Smith, hatter
and king bushman of the Upper Wonnangatta (Vic.),
vouches for seeing a rabbit take a flying leap at a
snake and, landing heavily, break the reptile’s back.
Presumably, if the first, shot misses, or merely dis-
ables, another go is permissible.
DAD’S SUNDAY BATH.
“Mulgo” : One afternoon I was looking for
a cow’ on Myrtle Creek, when I heard what I thought
was the tinkle of her bell in a patch of scrub on
the other side of the watercourse. When I got near
the spot there was a sudden startled jingle of the
bon, and then a boy about eight years old ran
out of the scrub. He belonged to a neighbor, whose
house was only a short distance away, and the bell
was hanging on his belt. It transpired that he was
an incorrigible wanderer, and as there was always
a danger of his getting lost, the bell was strapped
on him as a safeguard. He was a shy and rather
sensitive boy, and didn’t like strangers to see him
wearing the jingler. If he couldn’t run away in
time, with his hand on the metallic tongue, he
crouched in the grass until the stranger had passed.
Bush mothei’s have tried many schemes to keep track
of their children, but that was the only belled boy
I ever saw.

“H.V.E.”: The cormorant (or shag), be
he big or little, black, white-breasted or another
variety, is social in sleeping habit. Towards dusk
the foul, old-world birds may be seen silhouetted
against the evening sky, as they leave their ‘fishing
grounds and fly steadily inland to the tree which
is to serve as dormitory. At a considerable distance
they somewhat resemble the mountain duck, as the
flight is rather slow and labored. I have often
seen dead trees near a N.S.W. South Coast tidal
lake metamorphosed into whited skeletons owing to
their coating of cormorant guano, while be n ath the
tree is usually a fair-sized heap of the same material.
Yet this valuable fertiliser is seldom made use of
locally. It is a species of cormorant which, assem-
bling in enormous numbers on certain islands off
the coast of South America, chiefly forms the
famous nitrate beds or guano of commerce. On
these rich guano flel Is are caretakers whose busi-
ness it is to shoot the condors which prey on the
cormorants’ eggs and ugly young, and to pile up
and burn such birds as die naturally, else a pesti-
lence might arise. To some extent our cormo-
rants, though whales on the fry of valuable food fishes,
perform a useful office. From the crop of one shot
was listed up some young mullet, some worms, a
young lagoon tortoise and a few small brown eels.
Both tortoises and eels are themselves greedy’ de-
voured of the eggs and fry of valuable fishes.
* * * ■»
“Billy See”: It isn’t only sailors or
sleepers-out in the tropics who are liable to be
mocnstruck (B. 5/3/’25). I remember a night in
Kalgoorlie when a miner who was rather badly
“stung” slumbered in the open on the broad of hit
back beneath the rays of the full moon. He
awoke with his face curiously twisted and for a
day or two he was under observation as a mental
case in the Government hospital. However, as the
moon waned he recovered, but for months
afterwards the moonlight made him shiver. Per-
sons who have been sunstruek will shiver, too, if
caught bare-headed in the hot sun, and this will
last for years. I know that from my own experience.
“Nimrod”: Let me introduce “28” and
“Nitric” (B. 6/3/’25) to the best weather-tipster of
them all—the black magpie (jay) of the Tasmanian
highlands and lake country. A storm is nearly always
heralded there by the restless movements of these
birds, thousands of them, on the mountain sides.
All day their cries and the beating of their wings
can be heard, the congregation being sw'cllcd by
arrivals from all points, of the compass. The next
day there is a black, clamorous flight, lasting for
hours, over treetops and myrtle scrub until the
lowlands are reached. The storm may not break
for a day or two, but it never misses.
“Bill M.”: Wellington (M.L.) has decided that the
official meteorologist is more trustworthy than any
feathered rival. For three years a big albatross
came into port in the early part of March and each
time fine weather—exceptionally fine for the time of
year—followed. This year the Ancient Mariner’s
aversion arrived as per schedule, and shopkeepers
overstocked with “step-ins” and flame-colored stock-
ings went so far as to advertise “Albatross Weather.”
But within 24 hours came a northerly which blew
for a week, and there were heavy rainstorms and
not a little damage. Shotguns will be waiting for
the deceitful fowl in March, 1926.
“Centre”: If there is anything in “Akran’s” theory
(B. 12/3/’25) that the muscovy duck is a dab at
forecasting a downpour, we’re due for a second
Deluge. My muscovy ducks have been behaving in
a way that made me doubt their sanity, till I read
“Akran’s” par. Evidently their cake-walking and
tangoing and jazzing and circling are done with
the idea of getting me to re-roof the fowl-house
before the rain comes. But how far ahead of the
coming flood are they supposed to give warning?
Our mob has been performing for nearly two months
now, though the ants, earwigs, crickets, frogs,
spiders, cattle and other “prophets” in the sur-
rounding country are showing no unusual sign of
excitement.

“Boronia” : How is this for seed vitality?
Twenty-five years ago a packet containing Sturt-pea
seeds was sent from the eastern goldfields (W.A.)
to a resident of a Perth suburb. The seeds were
mislaid until a few weeks ago, when they were resur-
rected and planted. To-day the owner has a score
or so of healthy plants which promise to bring
the glory of this beautiful flower to Suburbia.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: Don’t know about
mango-trees attracting fleas, but I do know that they
attract hosts of black ants. We have several of the
vegetables growing near our house, and for several
years now the place has been over-run by ants which
we um’t h ; ft. They are not the ordinary small black
chap that usually makes raids on the sugar-bag, but
a somewhat larger and glossier insect that forages in
the foliage of trees. As this par. is being written
they are streaking up along the verandah studdings
in thousands, carrying with them their eggs. They
seldom molest eatables, but they will persist in eating
holes in the paper at the back of framed pictures
hanging on the wall and depositing their eggs inside.
The only thing we haven’t tried in attempting to
shift them is throwing stones at them. Can any
Abo. give us a useful hint?
* * * »
“Sandys”: I called about .’1 p.m. and he
asked me in to have a cupper tea ; but before opening
the kitchen door he discreetly poked his head in the
•window. “Thought the missus might be ’aving a
bath,” he explained.
* * * *
“C. Henry”: Can any Abo. name the
slimy beast I unearthed last week? I was splitting
a water-soaked log for firewood; in the centre oi
the log, embedded in the lotted wood and earthy-
debris, was a bluish-green worm—l say “worm” for
want of a better name—-about lOin. long. I could
distinguish neither- legs nor head, and its movement
was not apparently by any muscular effort; it seemed
to flow slowly out of sight like some viscous fluid
At its middle it was about as thick as my little
finger and rather lumpy, tapering at each end.
Its color was the most extraordinary thing about it:
it had a sort of fluorescent transparency, only com-
parable to the fluorescence seen in a hard vacuum
tube when a high p.d. is applied. It gave forth a
most offensive smell.
* * * *
“Jake” : A well-bred sheep-slut of ours in
Western Queensland has developed the atrocious habit
of devouring her litter. This has happened on
three occasions, and not once has there been any
apparent cause. Did she decide to make use of
the simplest method of freeing herself from the
trouble of rearing them, or can the Council suggest
a more plausible reason ?
* * * *
“Hayband”: Twice I have seen a record
drought and a record good season next
door to one another. In Queensland
the dividing line was a wire fence.
Terriek Terriek station had got the
benefit of half a dozen rainstorms,
aggregating inches. Sheep and other
stock, mud-fat, were unable to keep
up with the resulting growth, and grass
a foot high waved right up to the
fence. Dams overflowed and the station
had land for agistment. Eileen Downs,
just through the fence, missed these
storms. Hungry sheep wore the coun-
try down till it looked like a school
playground. Water was being carted
eight miles, and the gloom and misery
of a drought lay all over the property.
This state of affairs continued for eight
months, when a general downpour re-
lieved the situation. On the Richmond
River (N.S.W.) in 1902 a bountiful sea-
son and a drought held sway for about
nine months within 12 miles of each
other. About Bangalow and in to-
wards the coast the coekies had such
a good time, with high prices for pro-
duce, plenty of feed, both for use and
sale at starvation prices to their stricken
neighbors, that their aggregate smile
looked like the entrance to the harbor.
Above Casino, on the Upper Richmond,
about four inches alighted during the
period mentioned instead of the average
50. The only work doing was the lop-
ping of boughs for the starving stock
and “undressing ’em” when they died.
“Buttenden”: The one certain fact that
emerges from the latest argument as to whether the
’roo thumps with legs or tail is that, after a century
of hunting the animal and studying his habits, we
still don’t know everything about him. “Nitric”
asserts most positively that the tail is used; “Gouger"
is equally emphatic that it is the legs. Now, one
of these dyed-in-the-wool bushmen—as I take them
both to be from a long acquaintance -with their
writings—is manifestly wrong, and the probabili-
ties are that they both know a good deal more
about the habits of the ’roo than does the average
Australian. My own opinion is that “Nitric’s”
whiptail is either an exception to the general run
of marsupials, or a trick beast that ought to be in a
circus. At any rate, there’s one thing we all
know about the ’roo’s tail, whether he thumps with
it or not—it makes bonzer soup. Let me close
the discussion on that comforting note.
* * * *
“1.L.1.”: A few years back—perhaps it
lies there still —there was a fallen limb from a blood-
woou-tree just outside Brisbane, in one of Petrie’s
paddocks, with a history all its own. In 1824
a party of men looking for timber commenced cut-
ting this limb. The natives stole upon them and
managed to get away with an axe. The whites
fired, killing one of the blacks. Subsequently the
blacks killed two of the whites. From 1824 to
1624 is a long time, and that old bloodwood must
have been rather aged even before the limb blew
off. Bloodwood fence-posts on Petrie’s place are solid
as the day they were put in, 30 years ago; iron-
bark has had to be replaced twice in that time,
having been eaten by white-ants. Another long line of
bloodwood-fencing was tested after being 45 years
in the ground: all the posts pulled up were as solid
as when they were rammed in.

If you turned into Alfred Bark fo*r the
opening of the War Museum last Thursday
afternoon to the sound of a band playing
old-time patriotic tunes, and found yourself
with a queer little fluttering of the heart
and a tightening of the throat before "the
first flag flown at Anzac,” you felt it rather
incongruous to discover alongside of you
George Lambert, very natty in brown, sur-
rounded by a group of admirers, pointing out
both the merits and the limitations of his own
war pictures. It seemed a strange occasion for
a dissertation ‘on Art. Incidentally, artists
were frequent in the landscape, probably
keen on the work in the war records section ;
President of the Society of Artists, Uro
Smith, was in evidence, with Charlie Bryant
rather in the background. The Governor-
General opened the Museum, which is housed
in the old Exhibition Building, and fol-
lowed up speeches by Senator Pearce and
Premier George Fuller with a sort of ono-
father-to-another talk that made an enor
mous appeal to the waiting hundreds behind
the barriers. For the ceremonial was
held in the open air with a tapestry of
flags for background and such war chiefs
as General Rosenthal, General Herring,
General Brand and "Fighting Charlie” Cox
as special attractions. Tall and gentle war
correspondent Charlie Bean and Captain
Wilkins of the wizard camera were others
who walked with their dead. The models
of the famous battlefields and trenches prove
the most interesting, though both exciting
and fascinating to the philosopher or the
fatalist is the display of pocket objects which
saved lives. Gallant Boss Smith's aeroplane,
in which he made the flight to Australia,
and the cunningly wrought observation posts
Avill waken Young Australia to wild hero-
worship. Lady de Chair and daughter Elaine
were among the first-day visitors.
It was thoughtful of the A.J.C. to give,
the books a day’s outing amid the country
scenes of Warwick Farm last Saturday—
so healthy for the poor things before they
undertake the distressing labors and losses
of Easter at Randwick. Fashionable Syd
ney motored to the re-opening of "the Farm”
in hordes, and the journey to the spacious
racecourse by George's River was regarded
as a day-long picnic, many of the racegoers
lunching from hampers on their way. Per-
haps the distance from toAvn and a vacillat-
ing sky were responsible for the outbreak
of Easter models —many a new-line two-
piece got its first-of-the-season airing, and
felt hats crowned all the knutty ones.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers wore one of the white pull-
ons, and Morna MacCormick had another.
Mrs. Colin Stephen was, of course, among
those present, and brought daughter Helen.
Janet and Barbara Knox and Mrs. Roy
Chisholm, with sister Marjorie Little, were
others who sought a little flutter in the
country air. The just-returned Mrs. Oscar
Ireland and Mrs. Malcolm Mackellar Avere
tAvo good-lookers who distinguished the
almost-übiquitous brown attire. The Allen
clan was numerous and brisk, and actress
Janet Eccles was an incident in a meeting
that was rounded off by the presence of Mrs.
Pat Osborne.
The Institute of Journalists used up some
of its superfluous cash in dispensing wassail
(ordinary red and white) at Farmer’s the
other day. War-historian Bean Avas the
principal reason of eating (as a schoolgirl
once translated the worn-out French phrase),
and four other reasons Avere General Brand,
Elsa Stralia, Bessie Griffiths and Homer
Samuels —Galli-Curci’s husband. The last-
named appeared among the Avild newspaper
people (probably at Madame’s instigation)
in an American translation of the English
shooting-coat. From the moment his long
leanness uncoiled itself, Charlie Bean, an
almost transparent curtain of flesh for the
living flame to the glory of Anzac which is
his spirit, dominated the gathering. Pass-
ing his days amid the aeons of heroism that
the Diggers crowded into four years of Euro-
pean hell-brew, Charles Bean is a living
banner of a deathless army. He is, as it
Avere, a temple of the Holy Ghost of Anzac,
and his speech Avas a prayer: “Lord, keep
their memory green !”
The Musical Association, not at all doAvn-
licarted over Galli-Curci’s refusal to be its
guest last Aveek. duly went ahead with the
scheduled reception to songbird Elsa Stralia
and tin l members of her company, Bessie
Griffiths and tenor Jordan. Elsa, having
accepted the invitation, was on the mat to
the minute. Never before has the Musical
Association netted such a gathering of
celebrities and good frocking. Farmer's was
crowded out, and. every second person in that
roll-up had a public of his own in some one
of the arts. Dagmar Thompson, just back
from study with Ysaye, very sinuous and
blonde, introduced a new composition of the
Master’s to Sydney; and Bertie Kelly and
his orchestra played a Haydn quartette Avith
tine atmospheric effects. Frank Hutchens
sat in a front seat radiating goodwill to
man; singer Julia (’aroli came Avith her smil-
ing husband; tall May Moore convoyed Dean
Talbot’s wife; artist Charlie Bryant; sculp-
tor Theo Cowan ; the piano Beales; Trixie
Tange, with her pale gold mop; Mrs. Wun-
derlich of the satin-smooth skin—these were
among the hordes who murmured sweet words
to the smiling Stralia.
The glad hand to Stralia stretched into
its second week, with no lessening in the
warmth of its grip. Tea-parties, dinners
and receptions have followed one another
with a rapidity that must be bewildering to
the prima donna. The Millions Club spread
the carpet one afternoon last week, and 10
minutes after the appointed time it was im-
possible to wedge even the sharpest nose
into the infdee. Arthur Rickard, supported
by his lady, did the honors, and spoke of
Stralia’s English and American triumphs, re-
peating much that tenor Charles Hackett,
who had sung in grand opera with her,
had told Sydney concerning the sumptuous
quality of the singer’s tone. Musicians were
much in evidence at the afternoon brew, and
violinist Dagmar Thomson and singer
Dulcie Huxtable were responsible for one
of the most melodic programmes served at
such a gathering.
Herewith a little picture of Myrtle Meggy,
Sydney’s brilliant pianist, who received a
loud ovation the other day in Minneapolis,
where she appeared with the orchestra of
Hen r i Ver-
brugghen, one
time conduc-
tor of our
State Conser-
vator i n m.
Myrtle, who is
on the Con-
s e r vatorium
staff, is spoken
of in musical
circles as Syd-
ney’s livihgi
memorial t o
Sydney Moss.
She was that
teacher’s most
gifted pupil
at the time of
his death, and
the great
man’s admi-
rers deter-
mined to make
Myrtle t li e
musician lie had intended. Thus was study
abroad made possible for the clever girl.
Sydney Riley’s camera caught her for us.
The Old Masters knew well what they
were about when they painted the Mother of
Christ in a mantle of blue. It is the color
of tenderness; the color with which lovers
of old bound the letters of romance that
moderns have no time to write; the color of
forget-me-nots. So all last week a tent the
blue of babies’ eyes arched the city, and
poor in memories indeed was that man or
woman who failed to respond to the week’s
appeal on behalf of the Free Kindergartens.
No one who has not seen the kindergartens
in action and the narrow arid streets and
rooming houses which are their baby pupils’
homes can have any idea of the colossal
work the girl teachers are doing for the
race. Such poor, solemn little things most
of the small ones arc when they pass for
the first time through the open doors.
Laughter and joyous sounds are not the order
of their days, and that’s the big job—to
lead them in the way of happiness. Tire
demonstration early in the week, when hun-
dreds of babies made the Town Hall shrill
as an aviary with their work and their play,
was one of the best arguments in favor of
the extension of the campaign.
Wednesday may haAc been April Fool’s
Day, but as it applied to babies it rvas a
paradise, and they enjoyed every bit of it.
Packed into motor-cars, they skimmed in
hundreds about the city as happy as lark's,
and meanwhile grown-up friends at every
traffic junction peddled blue flowers at a
silver coin a piece towards the swelling trea-
sury.
The Blue Flower dance, engineered by a.
Younger Set committee. Idled the Wentworth
in the interests of the Kindergartens one
night of the .week. .V delphinium blue aura
that modernised itself into a jazz cap em-
bellished every dancer, the energetic lasses
at the helm cutting out a dance apiece to
traffic the blue cap and the blue floAver in
exchange for silver. Bose Hardy Johnstone,
the organiser, girdled her enthusiasm and
her orchid georgettes with silver; Grace
Jewell, the secretary, wore roseate softness
weighted Avitli beads; and treasurers Olga
Kosh and Ksme Rodd contrasted pale pink
and delphinium blue froeking. The ener-
getic girls have set out to raise £lOOO tor
the N.S.W. Union.
A festive and successful cabaret at. the
Wentworth, to which the Vice-reinc brought
daughter Elaine, and a Friday-night fair ir
the Town Hall were other money-raisers in
the kiddies’ interests.
Premier George Fuller’s daughter Gwen
hadn’t got used to the feeling of her new
engagement-ring before all Sydney knew of
her romance. The young man is Frank
Wharton, of North Queensland, and from
the moment the two of them were seen in
Hardy Brothers’ looking at rings it would
have been easier to check Niagara than the
spreading of the news. Gwen is one of
Sydney’s good-lookers and best-dressers, and
is as expert at jazz as at sport. The happy
man’s father is a director of Winchcombe,
Carson, and the name of his own station is
Furaba. But there’s to be a town house in
Sydney as well.
St. Philip’s lighted its tapers the other
night for the wedding of Nan Roberts, a
well-known North Shore line girl, to Cap-
tain Andrew, M.C.. of Rochester (Vic.).
The bride, who was squired by a brother, was
a study in ivory and gold; and gold also
was the predominating note in the froeking of
Mrs. Ward Hordern, who was the only fol-
lower of the bride. Colonel Callaghan best-
manned ; and Petty’s, near-by, served the
breakfast.
A before-Easter bride was Doris Brierley,
the dark-haired chick of fin l 11. ('. Rrierleys,
of Ashfield, who married Dr. Chris. David-
son (lie’s an old Rockhampton boy) at St.
Andrew’s, Summer Hill. Canon Langford
Smith tied the knot, and the bride, a shim-
mer of iridiseence misted over with tulle
that frothed into a georgette train, was fol-
lowed by four ’maids, all pale pinks and
golds, like sunset, who carried their heads
in a cloud of pink and silver tissue fashioned
into turbans. An equal number of male sup-
ports stood by the groom. The reception
was housed at Brierloeh, the home of tin*
bride’s parents.
The Elsa Stralia cabaret for St. Mar-
garet's threatens to be another pack-out at
the Ambassadors on the 22nd. Stralia’s visit
to the babies the other day had a terrific
effect; ever since special nurses have had
to be put on to train the newest Australians
in pianissimo effects.
Tarjmanian novelist Marie Bjelke Petersen
will soon have the joy of seeing her “Jewelled
Nights” on the silver screen. Louise Lovely
and her company are filming the story at
Savage River amid the picturesque scenery of
the Tasmanian West Coast, to the great joy
and excitement of the osmiridium miners who
inhabit those rain-swept parts.
Still the high cost of living! Raleigh got
himself into history by merely spreading his
cloak for a Queen's feet, but it cost Percy
Marks a garland of orchids containing an
opal worth £3OO of some other people’s money
when he wanted to do a Queen of Song proud
the other day. And suitably enough it was
presented at the English-speaking Union’s
4 o’clock at Farmer’s last Friday. The
bouquet was arranged in an engraved and
filigreed gold bouquet-holder such as the
ladies of old adored, and the jewel in its
diamond-setting lay in a sealed packet in its
heart.
May Moore’s camera interviewed Jack
Griffiths the other day, and made this pic-
ture of the popular concert manager. John
is managing the Stralia season, and expects
to have as
great a success
with her as
he had with his
first songbird,

The workers in the interests of the T.B.
Settlement have induced even the lions and
the tigers to give a helping hand, and on
April 30 all the animals in Wirths' Circus
will present a special performance, the gate
money to swell the total of the floral fete

The coach was busy demonstrating mashie
shots to a beginner, and didn’t observe the
stealthy approach of another fair player.
Whang! came a vicious hall right on tin
fleshy part of his leg. lie spun round, and
stammered hopelessly in his choice of the

The girl in the Hat opposite was invited
to a party and found herself in front of a
bell that, true to flat traditions, doesn't
ring, on the heels of three young men. all
spruce, bone-thin and wearing the jazz ex-
pression. In reply to a rattle at the letter
Hap the hostess arrived at the door sinuous
and coruscating. To her the three young
men raised their hats with the precision of
a drill manoeuvre, and spake the tallest:
“What happened to Lord CarnavonV” “lie
was stung,” intoned the second youth. “He
was stung,” affirmed the third, lingeringly
and regretfully, “lie was stung!” sighed
the hostess, taking the hats of all three, and
beckoning the other girl across the lintel.
In this way did the latest wheeze and the
girl opposite become acquainted.
The Oooma district is just welcoming a

The office Tennyson, after studying the
photographs, of the candidates for the Queen
of the May stakes in connection with the
Hospital Saturday appeal, throws the fol-
lowing into the lap of this Letter: —
If you're waking, cull me early, call me early,
Mother dear,
For 1 have much to do, Mother, the May Day of this
year—
To shear my thatch, and shave my neck, and “per-
manent’' my crop,
And twenty times to jerk, Mother, and twenty times
to hop,
And squeeze into my rubbers, Mol her, to keep the
bulges down,
For I must keep my title of the thinnest girl in
town.
Oh, there is much to do, Mother, to speed the voting
day,
When i'll bring home a pound or two for being
Queen o’ the May !
The week in Brisbane: —
While his Ex. is away up country the Hon. Hill
Lennon’s top hat will remain iioistcd at Ooceinmein
House. Before waving adieu to Brisbane, Sir Matthew
spread the cloth for the Lennons, Cecil Palmers,
Professor and Mrs. Steele, Canon Garland and others.
Captain Gardiner and the officers of the Devon
cooked up a concert at the Seamen’s Institute for
the friends of the Missions to Seamen. Cadets dressed
as Pierrots made amiable fooling before a blac.v
background of stars.
The Creche and Kindergarten should carry away
a full bag of siller from the benefit arranged in
Cremorne Theatre by the Eve and Christopherson
ladies. Mayne Linton’s elocution and Jessie Page's
charming singing were washed down with items by
J.C.W experts, Con Moreni, Ivy Davies and others
from the Empire and the Pony Ballet from the
Winter Garden. Barbara Sisley mothered a playlet
and the Havana band harassed the echoes.
On Saturday night the Muriel Starr company
packed up “The Pelican,” and took away a ton ot
tributes with it.
Mabel Zillman was principally responsible for the
musical repast spread at the Women’s Club on
April 2. Fred Homer’s baritone and J. Ellis's
piano playing were features of the show. President
llighfield and Martha Burns tendered thanks.
The E. R. B. Jordans purveyed grand opera in the
Elite Theatre, and just to show they could create
their own atmosphere they did it before red and
grey curtains and potplants. Elsie Coyle and Mrs.
Jordan got many vegetable tributes.
Nancy Blane poured tea for bride-elect Jean Bur-
rell amid a color scheme of pale gold roses, gold
tulle and tiny golden bells.
“Soldier” Foott’s old mates gave him a dinner at
the Daniel). The Engineers’ colors, purple, pre-
dominated. The electric lights glittered from under
red shades, between gum tips, concealing a centre
piece that was a wireless and voiced a word of
welcome. Besides a platoon of lieut.-colonels and
majors, Ethel Bage, ot Melbourne, Freda Bage and
Jean Aiuiand were sighted. An evening at Cremorne
with the Diggers finished the jollo.
A dinner and a dance finished the Mixed Foursomes
at, the R. Q. Golf Club. Big dahlias and gerberas
formed the setting, and amongst those who fed and
jazzed were the Erie Annings, Dr. and Mrs. Hopkins,
Crizel Gibson, Jean Moore, Mrs. William Dearden,
t lie Dobells and Whatmores.
Auchenflowcr Bowling Club farewelled James
Maskrey and gave him a smoker’s outfit, and to ms
lady a handbag. They are oil to the Cold Country.
Jazz and music finished the business.
A personal devil in the form of a green snake
laid itself to rest comfortably on the big Bible
in the Clavfield Baptist Church. Deacon Robson
went in to uncover the Book before morning
service, and found the emerald evil. Four feet six
uncoiled itself at the first stroke of the deacon's
stick, and then there was a race down the nave.
The stick won, and there was something besides
the sermon to discuss amongst the congregation that
day.

Phones Central 1532, 1533.
Relatives, friends and critics reported at
the Playhouse on Friday night, when Dorothy
Randle allowed what she had learnt in piano-
forte playing during her three years at the
Royal Academy. The maiden, who is grace-
ful" and slight, with a nice crimpy shingle
and but few birthdays behind her, suggested
in her interpretations not so much the exuber-
ance of youth as the more matured thought
of a poetic dreamer. Her knee-length rai-
ment was of rock-melon pink, and was bro-
cade above the waist line and iffarabout-
edged georgette below. The usual chocolate
boxes were'handed up (but of course nowa-
days you put silk hosiery in them), along with
garden stuffs innumerable. In tube frock of
white marocain, festooned with silver fringe
linked to a shower of silver blossoms, assist-
ing-artist Victoria Anderson, a hope of the
Albert-street Con., raised a contralto voice of
rare quality and range, and gathered in
an armful of floral acknowledgments. A
preliminary canter to the recital was a wel-
come to Dorothy and her mother at the
Austral Salon early in the week. Mayoress
Bruntou, in black millinery topping an all-
blending gown of beige georgette and lace,
was among the guests. The pianist was
charming in cinnamon tones, and her proud
parent relieved a black lace and satin toil-
ette and headpiece with grey. Victoria
Anderson and Viola Morris cheered the:
party with song, and Miss Callaghan with
story, when the teacups were removed.
The Stradbrokes were among those who
held strealners when the Khyber put out for
foreign ports, arid son George, who was off
to school at Harrow, held the other ends.
Lady Helena slipped off quietly a couple of
weeks ago, so Government House is even
lonelier than it has been since the death
of the small son.
Melbourne’s Garden Week at Wirths’
Olympia was a continuous flower parade,
with side-shows of all else that Mother
Earth produces, and lectures and demonstra-
tions thereon. The event called together
curators from around the continent in a
three days’ conference upon tree-planting.
Nearly a hundred authorities exchanged
opinions upon wlir.t, where and when to
plant. The Week's financial reaping went
towards the proposed Horticultural Scholar-
ship at Burnley College, which will be a
memorial to the late John Cronin, Director
of the Botanic Gardens. Mayor Bruuton
said the open sesame, and his lady, in a
sapphire-blue gown and black millinery,
smiled approval above presentation roses.
The flowers were gorgeous. There were
strangely beautiful orchids that had been
tenderly reared by the Orchid Club ; tuberous
begonias with big camellia-like blooms:
dahlias of every hue, and gladioli in hun-
dreds and as many shades. In a block of
ice pink ones shone silver-tipped. The City
Council sent its rarest from glass-house and
gardens, and no one marvelled when £50,000
was quoted as the annual upkeep of the aris-
tocrats. S. Australia sent apples to make
Adam sin again.
Pauline Frederick has had little spare
time, but has made it more by not attending
any afternoon-tea crushes. Rehearsals,
Saturday afternoons at the races, a look-in
at a theatre or a quiet game of poker in the
evenings—her life here has so far held
nothing more. The dust of travel was
hardly off when each member of the co. was
allotted a share of the “Spring Cleaning”
which will brighten the Theatre Royal on
Saturday night; and a visit on Saturday
found Pauline choosing the draperies and up-
holstering for the stage-settings. The scene
was like an Eastern bazaar, as stage decora-
tors and property men laid brocades and gold
trimmings at the star’s feet. Entrances of
performers through lemon, amber, pink and
green sounded to this Page like crawling
through a cocktail, but Snowy Baker says
there’s no harm in that. Essentially an
athlete and a lover of the open air, one of
l’auline’s first Melbourne enterprises was a
bit of horse-dealing, after which she ordered
a saddle of approved Australian lines. Next
week she will take to the open road daily.
The O’Grady is easily the most “runabout”
Governor Tas. has had. He goes every-
where, opens everything, talks freely and
interestingly on every conceivable subject on
which a Governor may permissibly express
liimself, and avoids with engaging dexterity
all the snares set for him by designing poli-
ticians and politiciennes. His liitherings and
thitheriugs about the island are so numerous
and kaleidoscopic that it must be a severe
strain on his womenfolk at Government
House to keep any sort of tab on his doings.
Now that his daughter, Mrs. Kerr-Cameron,
has flitted, his Ex. will probably get more
hopelessly out of domestic surveillance than
ever. Presumably daughter Margaret will
just have to tuck a latchkey into pa’s vest
pocket, admonish him to change his socks
regularly and avoid draughts, assure him
that he'll find a hit of something between
two plates in the kitchen stove if he should
return home in the night-time feeling peckish,
kiss him affectionately and leave the rest to
Providence. What else can the poor dear
do?
Amid tears and floral offerings innumer-
able, Mrs. Guy Bates Post has waved good-
bye from the Melbourne-Sydney express to
hubby and attendant friends. A home under
construction in Pasadena calls her back to
U.S.A. Said domicile is the very latest
breath of household electrification. Early
morning will find the attractive little woman
manipulating from her bedside many buttons
which set going the work-saving inach'nery,
even the coffee percolating under the mystic
pressure. The gown favored by American
society when playing mah jongg was donned
by the lady at a farewell gathering —
a robe long and tube-like and tightly swathed
about the hips, with leg-of-mutton sleeves
and turned-down collar, fashioned in almond-
green brocaded crftpe de Chine, evolved by
a Chinese designer of N’York.
Croquet, formerly a game for schoolgirls
or matrons and spinsters in the sere and
yellow, has become a scientific pastime of
the stronger sex. Stern men now gather
up the impedimenta of the craft, pack their
latest sporting suit—showing the Tut
influence in its material —and set out for
gigantic test struggles with other gentlemen
overseas. On a recent day Glen Robinson,
president of the Vic. Croquet Ass., assisted
by Mrs. Robinson, spurred with tea and
cake the chosen knights of his club to their
departure to battle with fellow-champions
abroad.
An evening reception at the Lyceum Club,
all dolled up with gorgeous gladioli, honored
the Tallis dame, who lias just got back from
abroad, and Mrs. W. M. Robins —their joint
efforts as honorary organisers of the Queen
Victoria Hospital Appeal last year caused
the pounds to pour into the institution’s
bank account even unto the hundred thou-
sand. The hospital for women is wholly
staffed and controlled by the sex. The
festivity was engineered by president Mrs.
Norman Brookes and the Q.V. committee.
The company included Dr. Constance Ellis
and a rare bouquet of women medieoes. Sil-
ver beads and rhinestones sparkled upon the
cosmos-pink gown of the Tallis lady, and
her co-worker was an opposing glitter of
crystal upon coral-pink georgette. The
president, in raiment of silver and mauve
brocade, and aided by Dr. Ellis, breathed
appreciation of the partners’ “love” game
with its “vantage” hospital.
This is composer Dudley Glass, who has
just returned from two years’ travel through
Europe’s musical centres, with a sojourn
in America on the homeward track. Un-
usual success has been his lot, for London’s
leading pub-
lishers have
accepted his
efforts, which
number 30, em-
bracing piano-
forte and violin
, pieces, many
art songs and
a choral work.
Notwithstand-
ing his serious
expression,
lighter num-
bers in waltz-
songs, which
had popularity
at the Palla-
dium and Coli-
seum, are also
amongst hi s
brain children.
For his songs
he writes his
own lyrics;
and he did the same for liis most ambitious
work, an operetta, though a very well-known
London playwright collaborated with him in
the “book.” This work is likely to be pro-
duced in London, but the composer nurses a
secret longing to see it upon the boards of a
theatre in Melbourne. Peter Dawson has
sung and Wembley has heard several of his
repertoire, and they will be immortalised
per the gramophone. Could youthful com-
poser desire more? The Albert-street Con-
servatorium taught him his first steps.
The £30,000 Appeal for Melbourne’s E;ye
and Ear Hospital got a £6OOO lift through a
general raid made by the predatory sex upon
the city and suburbs on a recent pay day. A
miniature brick was the sign put upon the
squeezed oranges. The onslaught was con-
tinued into the evening by a market and
c.-ife chantant at Hoyt’s de Luxe, with an
all-professional programme piloted by Eileen
Castles. The hospital has gone its splendid
way for 35 or 40 years in unsnlendid
premises, with much discomfort to doctors,
ministering angels and patients. But tne
badly needed additions are well in sight now’.

The reclaiming of her studio hustled Miss
Butler George into showing her hand some-
what earlier than she intended; so critics,
fellow-artists and friends have foregathered
daily to view her first big bronzes. Since
her return from London over two years ago
she has been busy on the two bas-reliefs
which will adorn the war memorial at Mont
St. Quentin. Strength and movement char-
acterise “The 2nd Div., A.1.F., in Attack’
and “Bringing Up the Guns.” The dainty
lady, who is given to wearing fussy frocks
and picture millinery, can say “Alone I. did
it!” for her fingers have not been guided
by teacher or school save for six months
unsatisfactory work divided between two
London art academies. Miniatures and fattS
prove the artist’s touch can be fairy-like as
well as vigorous.
The Alliance Francaise welcomed back
its president, Mrs. James Dyer, in . the
galleries of the Vic. Artists’ Society.
French Consul-General Bene Turek talked
about Corsica, and jazz kept the func-
tion from being too highbrow. For her
services to the society the silver medal of
the parent body in Paris was handed over
by the Consul with much eulogy to the chief
lady, whose black satin sheathing was traced
with an upstanding design in gold thread.
Some church people are scandalised at the
way Lenten services are being carried on in
a couple of ultra-high Anglican churches in
Melbourne. Holy water, sackcloth and the
confessional have bee™ introduced, and in
one of the two water blessed by the “prior”
is on sale. Whether the demand is greater
than the supply is not known, but on the
first day of sprinkling the faithful in one
chureli the suprdv re™ out.
At the Seamen’s Mission annual meeting
well-earned verbal posies were pelted at the
Ladies’ Plarbor Lights Guild, which lias
looked after over 40,000 Jacks ashore during
the past 12 months. An SOS was sent out
for recruits to the subscribers’ list at the
usual guinea a head. The meeting, which
had Lord Forster in the chair, finally resolved
itself into a tea-drinking. Hon. secs. Ethel
Godfrey and Beatrice Cuscaden worked over-
time seeing that no important matter or
person was overlooked.
The Hori. Mrs. Hebert Ui^desny—she was
Mary Clarke, daughter of the late baronet
William —is due in Melbourne shortly for
a chat with her girlhood’s friends. The lady,
who is a widow, married a son of an Earl of
Lindsay, and has one child, a girl. Her
widowed sister-in-law, Mrs. Reggie Clarke,
who with a Herbert Power daughter and the
Rupert Greene’s elder girl, Marie, has been
circling the world for the second time since
Peace blew in, landed back here the other
day. As daughter Joan has been left behind
at an English school it looks as if Mrs.
Reggie already has a third journey in view.
Her son and heir, Clive, is getting his learn-
ing at Geelong Grammar.
Philadelphia Robertson, the Red Cross
secretary, is handing her pen to an under-
stndv preparatory to embarking on an
English trip; and Chairman Morrice Wil-
liams asked the representatives of the
Aussie and Vic. Divisions to step into the
Hotel Windsor to cheer the lady over the
teacups. Mrs. Williams helped her hus-
band and Lady Forster gave vW-regil sup-
port. The chairman and Knight Edward
Miller provided the usual verbal posies,
which Lady Forster weighted with a gold-
equipped handbag and cheque.
Clarice, daughter of the Brighton Fred
Jeffreys, kept her date with Jack Whitton
at the Melbourne Grammar Chapel, in white

train that tiny chick Mullic Moody held
out of harm's way. Sister Florence and
Cousin Dome ‘tended the bride in frocks

lent appreciative ears; and l)r. Sugdon. Miss
Sugden, the Barrett pair, Mrs. Herbert
Brookes (a vice-pres.) and Professor Laver
were in the vice-regal compound. Outstand-
ing features of the programme were the
Beethoven Symphony No. 5 in O Minor and
the Cesar Franck Symphonic Variations for
Piano and Orchestra, the latter with soloist.

The Arthur Mahaffy widow lias coo-eed
across seas to mention that her daughter,
Sibell, a fetching blonde, has booked for a
matrimonial venture with a good-looking
Dublin Fusilier officer, Captain Cornish-
Hodelu, who is now in Cairo with the regi-
ili'ent; As Enid Boyd, the widow was one
Of the Smartest Melbourne Society girls of

his term of office as administrator of a West

Fiji.
Dorothea Spinney, whose presentation of
Greek plays is a pleasant memory of 1921.
has come this way again, and lately landed
ip Maoriland after successful English and
American tours. Melbourne audiences will
renew acquaintance with her towards the
end of next month. “Electra,” translated
by Gilbert Murray, is an addition to her
repertoire. Melbourne’s season will be
followed by visits to the sister States.
Doris Morton, who captains the company
of Girl Guides known as the 3rd Fitzroy
St. Mary’s, set out Londonwards last week,
by way of Java and Singapore, for further
Guide-training. The traveller, who is the
elder daughter of the popular medical Mor-
tons, is accompanied by Guide-Commissioner
E. C. Livingston, of Sou’ ’Stralia.
Sister Adelaide’s supplement:—
The newly purchased Mortlock home on Brougham-
place was house-warmed by a dance for visiting and
local poloists—the first big frivol of the season.
Mrs. Mortlock said how-d’y-do in silver-embroidered
black, and had as her lieutenants her sister-
in-law, Mrs. John Tennant, also in black, with
daughter Joan slim and charming in black ant
silver, and Mrs. F. A. Tennant, just back from
the other side, in gold and blue beaded crepe de
Chine fresh from Paris wrappings.
The Register- has been saying good-bye to two
of its staff —Walter Martin, who has looked after
its trade and finance columns for ages, and is booked
for a billet in Melbourne; and Winifred Scott, who
is bound for the Cold Land. Rugs and suit-eases
backed up the staff’s expressions of goodwill. As
“Magpie” Miss Scott is ' better known than any
other S.A. skirted journalist, and was one of the
first women in this State to daily tread the Inky
Way.
Joan, eldest daughter of the Walter Murray’s of
Cappeedee station and a grand-daughter of the
late John Murray of Rhine Park, has received the
Usual token from Ross, son of the George Lillicrapps

Captain Hambletcn will say good-bye to this
village when the Governor leaves, and will go back
with him to rejoin the Field Artillery. Legh Winser,
back from his trip to England, will step into bis
old job of private secretary.
There was a flutter at the Aldgate flower sho-.'
when a hive of bees swarmed in the hall, concen-
trating on the dining-room and its doorways. Hunger
and caution fought a prolonged battle, but the former
won.
Tne Jazz Frolics tried “The Japanese Teashop,’’ a
revue written by Wylton Todd, one of themselves,
on Norwood first. Dances and music were under
the direction of others of the band, Robert Help-
man and Val Robertson, and the excellent little
show moved with a swing from start to finish.
Asthore Symon, Marie Coghill, Charles Langley
and Robert Helpman were ameng its bright features.

FOOTBALL TIME
The Season of the Man!
The man who is justifiably proud of his athleticism is a
normal man, because he has got that physical and mental
balance which the world admires. His tastes are rational,
and he shines amongst his fellows not only for his virility,
but for his mental alertness.
Now that the manly game of Football assumes another season’s
crown the requirements of the game are demanding attention.
The name of Mick Simmons is Legion amongst footballers all
over Australia. Nowhere in the world of sport can any
store claim such superiority for football material as has

OTIONS
There were 25,000 people at Warwick
Farm (N.S.W.); on Saturday, and the A.J.C.’s scheme
of improvements came in for candid criticism, some
of which was justified. The public grandstand, it
was said with reason, is too small and too far
from the winning post, towards which it will have
to be extended, and the leger stand, though appa-
rently big enough, was also objected to on the score
of remoteness. Then there were complaints that the
straight was too short (this, unfortunately, it will
be difficult to remedy), that the catering resources
were inadequate, that the railway service was horrible
and that the extra charges to the birdcage and the
official stand were “over the odds.” No doubt the
A.J.C. will weigh the objections well and see what
can be done to better things by the time the next
meeting comes round. In any case punters would
have found less to blame and more to praise (and
there is really a great deal that is praiseworthy) if
favorites had not gone down so persistently. The
Brush Steeple was won by Plain Alwyne at 10's,
the Fairfield Handicap by Manfred at the same
price, the Liverpool Handicap by Golden Voice at
12’s, the Chipping Norton Stakes by Wallace Mort-
lake at 16’s, the Autumn Cup by Ceo at 20’s, and
the first division of the Cabramatta Handicap by
Hemisphere (two horses being preferred) at 7’s.
After this succession of disasters, the public backed
half a dozen quadrupeds in the last race—it was
the second division of the Cabramatta —only to see
an obscure neddy called Nostalgia, friendless at
20’s, except for a mild stable commission, beat
the whole six and the other eight as well. Nostalgia
is a three-year-old colt by The Epicure’s sire The
Sybarite—Marvina, and like his more famous rela-
tive is a resolute finisher. But his finish brought
gloom to 99 p.c. of the punting brigade, though
McShortodds reckoned it the end of a perfect day.
None of the newspaper tipsters made Beauford
their No. 1 choice for the Liverpool Handicap, but
the bagmen quoted the topweight at a short price
always (3 to 1 was the best), and stacks of public
money came for him. Next in demand was Brimming
(s’s). a well-built, beautifully-muscled chestnut,
looking more like a five-year-old than a filly, while
Braehead and Bathos were at 7’s, and Golden Voice
at 12’s. Beauford jumped out smartly, but an early
bump took a lot of the steam out of him, and
Sunburst suffered in the same way, as did several
others. One who escaped was Golden Voice, who
trailed Kilkenny Lass for a few furlongs, and,
giving her the go-by, came into the straight with
a good lead which he increased to two lengths and
a half in the run to the judge’s box. He was
followed home by Brimming, who finished fast after
having been badly placed, and then by Quixotic,
Braehead, Kilkenny Lass and Beauford. Golden
Voice, w T ho galloped the six furlongs in Imm.
13Isec., is a three-year-old brown gelding by Demos-
thenes—Golden Shoe, owned by H. E. A. and V.
White and trained by J. Barden. He is in the
Doncaster with 7st. 10lb., 21b. less than Saturdays
weight, and will meet Brimming on the same terms,
a difference of 31b. in her favor; but, excellent
sprinter though he unquestionably is, it is doubtful
whether he can go a mile. There is no such doubt
in her case.
The big, punters put in heavily on Poetaster
(6 to 4) in the two-year-old race, but she failed them
badly, nor was Manfred, a Valais —Otford colt,
fancied by Ben Chaffey. The Hawk (2 to 1 onin
the absence of Whittier and Heroic) also failed
them in the Chipping Norton Stakes, but he should
not be discarded on that account by those who
fancied him for the Doncaster. After all, a mile
and a quarter is a bit further than he cares to go.
Then, instead of riding him behind several horses,
as he did at Rosehill, Pike let the little fellow
dispute the lead for three furlongs with The Night
Patrol, who galloped brilliantly for a while, thougn
palpably a bit above himself. Having settled the
English horse, The Hawk was tackled by Windbag,
and Lilypond and Wallace Mortlake joined in an
exhilarating struggle which ended in favor of John
“Baron” Brown’s chestnut by a short head, Windbag
being second, Lilypond half a length away third
and The Hawk a close fourth. Wallace Mortlake
was ridden by Norman Wood, who is not long back
from India. Allowed 141 b. for being a five-year-old
maiden, he carried Bst. 2lb. (The Hawk had
9st. 91b.), or 2lb. less than his Sydney Cup impost.
He is naturally in demand for the Cup, but
although he ran a fair race in Sir Andrew’s Metro-
politan, two miles may be too far for him.
The Autumn Cup was a very rough race, and
some of those who chased the place-getters home
will assuredly do better at Randwick, with its long
stretches and stamina-testing straight. It. was sur-
prising to find Prince Minimbah at 16’s, for he had
been holding his own with Wallace Mortlake on the
track, but the stable doesn’t bet to any extent, and
it is a habit with many punters to follow the
money. That commodity came in cartloads for
Wallarak (s’s), Houdini t6’s). Solidify (7’s), Royal
Ron,'- (7’s), Accarak (B’s) and Confusion (10’s).
The last-named was badly interfered with, and
the others never got out of the ruck, but Wallarak
was running on encouragingly when it was too late.
Dialogue saw to the pace, but Prince Minimbah,
who was never further back than third, disposed of
him before the straight was reached, and shot away
with a good lead. The Prince won by three-quarters
of a length, with a lot in hand, but near the
judge’s box he shifted towards the rails, and
although there was no actual interference the stewards
awarded the race to Ceo on the ground that he had
been blocked while making his run. It was a
decision that astonished nearly everyone on the
course, the bookmakers especially—some of them
bet 0 to l Ceo on the protest, others 8 to 1, one
man even 10 to I—and in this page’s judgment
the stipendiaries blundered. A caution or a small
fine would have met the case. Ceo, till recently a
“picnic” horse, is owned by Colonel Rutledge,
Progressive M.L.A. for Goulburn, who left for
Engktnd a few days before the race, having previously
refused an offer of sweep-money, and is trained by
N. Dewsbury, while S. Oracknell had the mount.
By Earlston, a sire of stayers, out of Mistle, he is
a hardy customer who can take a knock or two and
come again, and he will have to be reckoned with
in the Sydney Cup, in which he has 7st.—Blb. less
than on' Saturday. Kingslot (20‘s) was a good
third, and the 12 furlongs were left behind in
2min 34|sec.
If the rain stays away new attendance
records will proboblv be registered at Randwick
this Easter, for Sydney, in addition to its residential
population of a million or more, has been invaded
RUNNING STIFF.
“Any luck?”
“No; I don’ think th’ flamin’ worm’s after it!”
by an unusually large number of sun-tanned people
with money to burn; the result of fat cheques for
wheat and wool. Then the A.J.C.’s bill of fare has
never looked better. Beauford has emerged from
his retirement, Heroic, Whittier, Baekwood, Lilypond
and The Night Patrol have arrived from Victoria,
Te Kara has come from Maoriland, and David is
still in the business—though why the game old
fellow hasn’t been retired to the paddock he has
so richly earned is one of the mysteries of the
turf. Most of the cracks will meet in the w.f.a.
Autumn Stakes, 12 furlongs, on Saturday, and per-
haps Heroic will return C. B. Ivellow a portion of
his 16.000 guineas in that race, though it is
doubtful whether the chestnut will go faster than
Whittier or The Night Patrol in the All-aged Stakes,
one mile, on the Wednesday. Then the St. Leger gives
promise of being as thrilling as when Millieme
downed the mighty Artilleryman five years since. Six
or seven weeks ago the task ahead of Spearfelt
looked fairly easy, but since then Meenah and Wind-
bag have shown splendid form, and one or other, if
not both, will give him trouble in large quantities.
Still, the Spearhead colt is selected to win. The
three-year-olds are a very fine lot this season.
Valiard, the Newmarket Handicap winner, has dis-
appeared from the Doncaster, but Mountain Song
(Bst. 61b.), Golden Voice (7st. 101 b.), Lausanne
(7st. 91b.), brimming (7st. 71b.) and Nostalgia
(6st. 121 b.) are in that race, and this commentator
won’t be surprised if any of them comes home.
The same, however, is true of The Hawk (lOst. 51b.),
Whittier (9st. 101 b.), AH Sunshine (Bst. 111 b.),
Polytheist (Bst. 101 b.), Valiant (Bst. 31b.), Valdoona
(Bst. 21b.), Encre (Bst.), Julia Grey (7st. 111 b.). Royal
Dighton (7st. 10lb.) and Fair Rosaleen (,7st. 8lb.).
There has never been a more open Doncaster. In-
stead of the murderous prices marked on the book-
makers’ charts during the last week or two and
wired to other parts of the Commonwealth (punters
in distant States have to take dynamite odds as a re-
sult of the wowser ban on publication in N. S.
Wales and Victoria) it should be Bto 1 the field. Lau-
sanne’s public trial at Rosehill on March 27 greatly im-
pressed the writer, and if the colt can stand another
good gallop on Thursday (he has been favoring a
leg, although there doesn’t seem to be very much
wrong with it, and he ran brilliantly in Melbourne
when half fit) he may add to Toohey’s extraordinary
run of successes in the Doncaster. And Valiant is
chosen as the next best on the theory that a.
good four-year-old with a handy weight and recent
form to recommend him is nearly always dangerous.
There is no getting away from the fact that Poly-
eletan is wonderfully well handicapped in the Sydney
Cup. Humping 7st. 131 b. in the Rosehill Cup,
11 furlongs, on Sept. 18, he beat Purser (9st, 101 b.)
and Spearfelt (7st. 91b.) handily. Purser subse-
quently won the A.J.C. Sydney Handicap, 11 fur-
longs and 210 yards, with 9st. 81b. and the
Caulfield Cup, in a canter, with 9st. 51b. Spearfelt
has been third in the A.J.C. Derby and the Mel-
bourne Cup, and first in the V.R.C). Derby and St.
Leger. Polycletan has landed the Metropolitan
(with 7st. 41b.) and a welter at Rosehill with 9st.
131 b., while he was a good third at w.f.a. to The
Hawk and Whittier. Now he has only 7st. 121 b.,
whereas Spearfelt, one of the favorites, has Bst. 101 b.
Other horses fancied by their trainers are Lilypond
(9st.), Te Kara (Bst. lllb.), Wallace Mortlake (Bst.
41b.), Windbag (7 st. 121 b.), Brown Rajah (7st.
lllb.), Meenah (7st. lllb.), Wallarak (7st. 51b.),
Valwyne (7st. 41b.), Confusion (7st. 31b.) and Ceo
(7st.) ; but Polydetan looks the pick. If he fails
to see it out Valwyne’s number may be hoisted by
the man in the box. As a three-year-old this beauti-
fully bred mare (she is by Valais —Beanbri), ran
eighth in Bitalli’s Melbourne Cup, and she is very
well just now.
* * * *
After his impressive gallop at Mentone
the previous week, when he was fast overhauling
Last Drop at the end of six furlongs, Pluto (9 to 2)
looked a good thing for the Epsom Handicap at
Mordialloc (Vic.) on Saturday, even though he
had four furlongs further to travel. And a good
thing he proved to be. Beeline was favorite, and a
parcel went on Demades (s’s), who missed the
Duncan touch, but once in the straight Pluto cut
down Darjeeling and went on to win nicely from
Danton (10’s), who seems to be regaining his good
Tasmanian form, and Beeline in the fast time of
2min. 6}see. H. E. Connolly, who owns Jackstaff,
too, bought the Sutala —Procrastinate gelding (he
comes from M.L.) six weeks ago, and has done well
with him. In the two-year-old race On Top (s’s)
upset a course record that had stood for 10 years, by
running five furlongs in lmin. Jsec.; and Waranton,
beautifully ridden by Norman Devereux, established
new figures in the very next race, encompassing
the distance in 59£sec. Although Devereux has been
very successful lately, Waranton was allowed to go
out at 10’s.
* * * *
“Hamer”: “Bunty” Brown, who steered
Backwood to victory in the last Melbourne Cup, is
giving up the jockey business. “Bunty” has to his
credit a long list of wins in big fixtures —the V.R.C.
Derby (on Whittier), the A.J.C. Derby (Rivoli), the
Vic. St. Leger (Caserta) and the V.A.T.C. Debutant
Stakes (Liquid Fire) amongst them —but he prob-
ably feels that he is putting too much poundage on
his unusual (for a jockey) length. One stranger at
the last Cup discounted the chances of Backwood
when he saw him mounted, and, although urged,
declined to back the horse. “What, with a pole
of a jockey like that on top!” he sneered. “Why,
before lie could whisper encouragement to his mount
they’d both have to be fitted with wireless!”
* * * *
“Lud” : Frank Dompsey broke his duck in
the second week of the English flat-racing season,
and already English critics are predicting that lie
will make his mark. Hi's initial success was gained
on one of the very old-fashioned courses—Warwick—
and the left-handed running probably suited him.
Given a fair go, Dempsey should do as well as
either Bullock or Carslake, who are both getting up
in years. That he is one of the finest riders living
there can be no question. One of his best efforts, 1
think, was on Royal Thought in last year’s V.A.T.C.
Oakleigh Plate. Probably no other boy in Aus-
tralia could have got that outsider home. Anyhow
the animal has not scored since.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The winning of that most
gruelling of jumping races, the Liverpool Grand
National, will come as a knock to those who say
that Roi Herode’s stock cannot stay. The winner,
Double Chance, was by the famous French grey,
and anything that, can get round the awful four
miles at Aintree has nothing of the squib in its
make-up. The same charge was levelled here at
Chry,solans, also by Roi Herode, and the failure of
the Aga Khan’s filly, Mumtaz Mahal, in the English
three-year-old classics last year, after her triumphs
over the two-year-old distances, was advanced as
further evidence that it was merely a sprinting
family. Mumtaz Mahal is a daughter of The
Tetrarch, Roi Herode’s best son, whose breakdown
as a three-year-old never gave him a chance to
show over a distance.
» * » *
A keen fortnight of polo in Adelaide
showed a young and hard-riding family party from
Mount Crawford (S.A.) —three Murrays and Angas—.
the best team in sight. Three or four teams from
Victoria kept things going, and were a trifle too
good for anything except Mount Crawford.
* * * .
A crowd of 20,(MX) sweltered at the Mel-
bourne Motordrome on Saturday afternoon to see the
Americans Thye and Miller wrestle for the “light-heavy-
weight championship of the world,” and decided after-
wards that the swelter was worth while. Thye weighed
in at 3-Jlb. less than the 12st. 71b. to which he was
limited, and Miller scaled list 811 b. Miller got the
first fall—-the result of some interesting work in
the fifth round. Five rounds later Thye made the
smaller man tap the mat in token of submission, and
no further incidents (nor any accidents) occurring
in the next three rounds, the referee declared it. a
draw. The match was advertised to be for 50 [)m.
of the gross and a £lOOO purse, but on Monday
came the announcement that the management had
been “misled” as to the conditions, or something of
the sort, and that the purse would be hung up for
a finish fight or wrestle or exhibition or whatever
it is. So the men are to meet again. They always
do in these cases.
“H. Hardupp”; Alf Bridges, who refereed
the Thye-Miller affair, is the Stadium’s
trained spider. In street clothes he gives
that misleading appearance of slightness which
often goes with a well-proportioned figure.
Good at the grappling game himself, he has to
keep as fit to referee a match as if he were himself
a contestant. Spectators realise this when they see
Alf doing his spider acts as he chases the heavy
masses of muscle around the Stadium ring, sometimes
hung over the ropes with his head near the ground
so' that he may not miss a possible pinfall.
* * * *
Darton, the rugged Belgian middleweight,
stopped Archie Bradley in 16 rounds at Brisbane
on Saturday, and 5000 yelling Queenslanders saw
a great, fight. Archibald shaped like a winner for
10 rounds, but there was a bit too much powder in
the Belgian’s punches.
* * * »
“Adelaide”: Never saw “hit on wicket”
(or h.0.w.) in print till The Bulletin quoted and
queried it ; but there is a growing tendency in
South Oss to report “played on, b. So-and-so,” which
is exactly the same thing. I know that neither
expression is to be found in the rules; but, after
all, it is rotten luck to play the ball and then find
it disturb the stumps, and no wonder the batsman
—and the reader, too —likes to have the hundred-to-
one chance noted, when it comes off. Much less
excuse is there for the cricket reporters’ recent craze
for saying—not on the score sheet, but in the de-
scriptive stuff —that each batsman was “clean” bowled.
Of course he was, unless the contrary is stated. One
might just as well add “not on foul” to the
report of each race and each fight.
* * * *
“Wink”: Mayne has confounded his
critics again. In the first two Tests in Maoriland
he made two blobs and 1 in three knocks, and the
critics gleefully labelled him a back number, as they
had done so often before. And then Edgar must
come to light with 210 in his very next innings,
a feat which has enabled him to wear his faded cap
as jauntily as ever. Nowadays when he does manage
to stay in for a while, Mayne toils and scrapes like
any drudge, but in his prime he had few peers as
a graceful batsman. He would flash the ball tfo
all parts of the field with a seemingly careless
ease. It is in apeing this former insouciance that he
generally gets out l.b.w. or in some other silly way.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The M.L. R.U. team to
visit Australia will come over early in June and
will stay a week longer than usual in order to
plav at Newcastle. In spite of the strong Soccer
following in the coalmining city, the Union game
holds its own comfortably against its League rival,
which has never made a big hit up there, as it
has done in the metropolis and the larger country
towns. The All Blacks first visited Newcastle as
far back as 1884, and Queensland invariably had a
shy at the Hunter River men going to or returning
from Sydney. In those days, Newcastle could field
a tough side and was always well represented in the
State and international teams.
TRANSMUTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bonzer was a noddy brave:
He ate the glass on Kewan’s grave,
And never after that would graft,
But jibbed and bucked both fore and aft.
He ate the grasses off the mound
That covered Dennie underground;
Thenceforward he was just a rip
Who took no heed of slat or whip.
To draw some sleepers or the like
You ask him and he goes on strike
Because he’s eaten of the weeds
That Dennie Kewan’s spirit breeds.
This Dennie lvewan, feckless craytur,
Was an industrial agitator
Who loved a strike, and loathed the irk
Of seeing brother man at work.
All flesh is grass, as people say,
But I would prove to you to-day
The saying may be just as true —
All growing grass is spirit too.

THE INKY WAY.
Ex-Inspector D. G. O’Donnell, of the Vic. Detective
force, is publishing his reminiscences in the Gisborne
Gazette. The old “demon” has taken to farming
in the district in which he was born. His stone's
are well written, and there is less fiction in them
than in most police yarns.
Gone from the Inky Way, at 58, Robert Deckc.
Learning the job in Jarrahland he anchored finally
in Sydney, where he worked on all the morning
papers, being at the time of his death commercial
writer for the Daily Telegraph. He was a founda-
tion member of the A.J.A., and a delegate to the
society's first inter-State conference —in 1912.
Herbert Vickers, the new sec. to the Vic. Premier,
began life as a cadet on the old Bendigo Evening
News. Apprenticed for five years, he received for
the fii'st year five bob a week, and in the fifth year
he thought he was rich with a pound a week. In
1888 he entered the Vic. Civil Service, and after
37 years’ effort has reached the height of his ambi-
tion.
“C.”: Frank Harris, no longer editor of American
Pearsons’, now spends his days in the sunshine c f
the Riviera. Although over 70, he promises him-
self a trip to Australia in the near future. The
banning of the first volume of his audacious “Life
and Loves” was a severe blow to him; yet he is
going on with the second and third. If they get
past the Censor they should be worth reading, Harris’s
pet business being to show Important People with
as much of their shirts hanging out as possible.
R. W. Kenderdine, of Federal Hansard, has just
completed his second term as Federal President it
the A.J.A. One of his most notable achievements
lias been to obtain an award covering the provincial
newspapers in Australia. The conference which dealt
with the award lasted 11 days, and it was due
largely to the tact of Kenderdine that it did not on
several occasions break up. At the coming annual
conference of the A.J.A. he will probably be elected
for a third term, and also earn the gold badge, the
highest honor the A.J.A. has to offer to its members.
“J.G.”: On March 23 flic ICilmore (Vic.) Free
Press completed its 60th year, and it has been
owned and edited all the time by Tom Hunt, ex-M.L.A.
Although well into the 80's now, the old record-
breaker still takes an active interest in the pro-,
duction of his paper. He is, further, the oldest of
all who have sat in the State Parliament, having
entered the Assembly in the early ’sixties. Nowadays
his spare time is occupied in sitting on the Board
of the Kilmorc Dairy Co. and the Kilmore police-
court bench; in addition lie is the deputy-coroner
of the district.
“Ian”: J. Weatherston, of Federal Hansard, was
prominent at the A.N.A. conference at Ballarat, a-
one of the St. Kilda delegates. Weatherston began
bis journey on the Inky Way as a cadet on the
Melbourne Evening Standard 32 years ago. Thence
be went to W.A., and after a term on the goldfields
and the now extinct Perth Morning Herald joined
the State Hansard. From that to his present job
was but a step. Billy Admans, deputy chief of Fed.
Hansard, was a sub. on the Standard when Weather-
ston was a cadet. Was there ever such a happy
family as that hard-worked, underpaid Standard
staff ?
“Guna”: That kindly old Inky-wayfarer, Donald
McDonald, lias left his charming bush garden at
Black Rock for Kyabram and its drier air. Buying
an acre of tangled ti-tree and wattle thicket at
Black Rock many years ago, the nature-lover built
himself a queer, ramshackle domicile. Not wishing
to disturb his feathered and furred tenants, he
built rooms only where there were bare patches.
When letting this place recently, lie made a proviso
that an aged bandicoot who had occupied a ti-tree
patch for the past seven years must not be disturbed,
and also that three blue-tongued lizards were to
retain their sanctuary.
“Simon”: My newsagent has a Machiavellian way
of bringing people to his shop whose accounts are
overdue. Ilis way is to administer an irritant, as it
were.- Thus a hardshell Nationalist who has had the
Labor Daily thrown on his verandah for a couple
of mornings instead of the S. M. Herald is sure to
come along hot-foot to protest against the outrage.
His wrath is nothing to that of the devout lady
who finds Strewtii obtrusively stuck in the garden
hedge for the church people to see. He also tells me
that the Catholic Press applied under the front
gate never fails to bring along a heated Protestant
whose account is in arrear. And the Watchman.
Well, take the case of Mrs. McSweeny. She brought
it back in a pillow-slip with a “Here, for the luv av
Heaven, take this! I found it on me front verandy
—the holy season av Lint, too!”
“F.T.K.”: A literary aspirant who for ages un-
successfully tried every known journal in Sydney
gave himself land editors) a respite only when lie
went dotty on a Titian-haired charmer who for a
time fancied him a persecuted Milton. She soon
transferred her affections to somebody with no literary
yearnings, whereat the blighted one reeled off tour
closely-typed sheets of foolscap, placed it in his
pocket addressed to the police “or whosoever shall
find my body," took a dose of poison and laid him-
self down to die outside the charmer’s flat. But
death was cheated; he was discovered in time and
rushed to a hospital, where a stomach-pump restored
him to life and letters. I interviewed him in the
Reception House. When I told him of the letter
explaining his intended exit to a better world, he
joyfully cried “In print at last!” But when l
informed him that his four-pager was cut down to
20 lines he fumed and 1 swore and declared that
“the damned police cared as little as editors for
literature.”
HELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 dreamed that out of this world 1 passed, to the
end a good-for-nought.
And “at all events I shall find at last what Hell is
like,” 1 thought.
1 shuddered to think of ihe ghastly things on the
foul Plutonian shores,
Beyond the flapping of Azrael’s wings and the swish
ol' old Charon’s oars.
1 turned my mind to some of the hells foreshadowed
in Holy Writ,
With brimstone trimmings and sulphur smells in
an incandescent Pit,
And troops of devils with forks of flame who yell
with fiendish glee
While they prick and prod each sinner’s frame for
all eternity.
And then 1 was up against Sheol's gates where
Satan’s realm begins—
So most tilings come to him who waits and more
to him who sins.
A liveried Imp behind me slammed the door and 1
gazed, as bid,
Where the souls of a million billion damned pay
dear for the deeds they did.
And sudden my reeling sense it reached, here was
torture more refined
Than ever a Knox or a Calvin preached in the
world 1 had left behind.
For each of the lost a paper gripped, a die. and a
pencil, too,
And the groans they oozed and the oaths they dripped
would harrow you through and through,
And the little devils put in the boot as they hustled
to and fro
On many a form in pain acute with knitted brow
bent low.
“.Just crossword puzzles, young fellermelad,” said
the guide, “and the Old Man claims
They beat the best that we ever had in the way ot
hellish games;
Beat all the tortures, outworn, antique, that Torque-
mada knew,
So we set ’em one each day of the week, the mob—
and on Sundays two.”

Galli-Curci, with her lark-like arabesques
of sound, is still, after five concerts, packing
Sydney Town Hall. The critical may find
monotony in the singing, but it is melli-
fluous monotony that is worth more than
its weight in gold to the management. The
voice is not always tone-perfect, in spite
of the loud hssli to the contrary, and the
little singer’s diction is noticeably careless.
But so long as she can sing “Una Voce” from
“The Barber,” and Bishop’s “Lo! Here the
Gentle Lark” as Sydney heard her during
this season, her coloratura laurels are still
safe. There was a sparkling joyousness
about “The Lark” that was irresistible, and
a brilliance in “The Barber” number that
provided a super-tlirill. There is a creamy
smoothness in the middle tones, and a limpid
quality which imbued Grieg ! s “The Swan,”
and the Rimsky-Korsakoff “Chanson Indoue”
with a contemplative charm. The Mad Scene
from “Lucia” was not one of the successes,
probably because it came at the end of a
long programme still further enlarged with
encores. (When will concert-goers be satis-
fied with one hour’s singing instead of de-
manding a list of numbers whose length alone
must give them a sort of musical indiges-
tion?) Benedict’s “La Capinera” pro-
vided another of the dizzying thrills of a

season whose vocal loop-the-loops included
Adolph Adam’s “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman?”
and David’s “Cliarmant Oiseau,” and whose
classic atmosphere was gained by smooth-
flowing compositions of the old French and
Italian masters. But a protest should be
made against the inclusion of such extra-
ordinary encores as “Just a Song at Twi-
light.” Probably Madame thinks Australia
too young a country to remember it. At all
the concerts Mr. Berenguer supplied the
flute obligato to such numbers as called for
it; and on almost every bill he was set down
for solo numbers. Unfortunately for Mr.
Berenguer this country has produced and
heard again and again both an Amadio and
a Lemmone. Mr. Berenguer is as little
suited to solo work as Mr. Samuels.

Vaudeville appeals to the great public for
the same reason as a smoke concert, a beano
in a ship’s fo’c’s’le or a wireless programme.
Any individual in the audience can drop out
when he has had enough. The trouble about
m st musicql comedies this country imports
fr».m U.S.A. is that they call themselves
plays, brandish at infrequent but irritating
intervals something they call a plot, and
insist on being sat out to the end, just the
same as “Hamlet” and “The Murdered Bug
and the Blood-stained Bedpost.” In the
latter cases, however, the cunning play-
wrights have introduced an element of doubt.
You have to stay to the final curtain to
know w r ho murdered the insect and who is.
going to finish Hamlet when he has finished
all the rest. They have succeeded by subtle
means in making you feverishly anxious
about the fate of both. Nobody but a con-
genital idiot or an unsophisticated head-
hunter could have any doubts about the fate
of the musical-comedy heroine and her
musical-comedy lover; and as the situations
that carry them along to the extremely in-
evitable conclusion consist of a series of
vaudeville turns, much mental strain would,
be avoided if the plot were stated in a few
concise words on the programme and left
out altogether from the manoeuvres on the
stage.

Apparently “Kid Boots,” which drove off
at Sydney Majesty’s on Saturday, was born
in one of Uncle Samuel’s lucid intervals;
it is an exception, although not a terribly
rampageous one, to the above melancholy
rule. A comedy of golf, it succeeds consis-
tently in hanging round the clubhouse, with
occasional excursions into the caddie-shop
and the ladies’ locker-room; and although
Field Fisher, as a grouchy manufacturer
of sporting goods, and Gaston Mervale, as
his foxy rival, hardly justify their corporate
existence, and George Grotty, as a social
observer, doesn’t observe anything worth
writing home about, most of the cast are
well in place. Everybody dresses in plus-
fours or fetching sweaters; George Gee. as
the caddie-master, makes fun of a very
solemn pastime; George Vollaire, as a semi-
pro., uses his position as a means of snaring
the heart of Josie Melville, a member of the
club; Adele Crane sings about the game
very nicely and Jean Newcombe plays it
very badly. Floie Allen looks after the
ladies’ lockers with her usual sparrow-like
alertness. Even the scenery does its best
to look as splendid as the landscape that
frames the Killara golf links outside Sydney.
* * * *
Altogether. “Kid Boots” is a superior brand
of merchandise, and carries the usual high
polish of .T.C.W. productions. Wahne Slius-
kah, a Red Indian lady, dances Spanish
fandangos capably, and Harry Tierney’s
music is better matured than the light vint-
ages of these days usually are.

The Rudd family is in Sydney again—it
is its habit to drop in about the time bakers
do a roaring trade in buns and the fish
hawker comes into his kingdom. This year
the canvas gum-trees have their roots at the
Palace, and those who saw the hoary Aus-
tralian character-comedy a .score of years
ago will be surprised to find that Fords,
movies and the radio craze have made no
impression on the Rudds. They are still
exaggerated types—Pitt-street buslimen —but
such is the power of repetition that thousands
of metropolitans and even many country
people accept them as utterly true to life.
In reality Billy Bearup, instead of bolting
when he sighted Dad, would touch the old
man for the “makings” and whisper a dead
cert for the Doncaster in return, while the
Careys exist only in Bookstall novels, and
are not the curse that canvassers are. Still
the Rudds have a host of warm friends
who wouldn’t miss the little bit about the
minister and the last scone for a first prize
in Tatt.’s. Bert Bailey has quietened down
a little as Dad, but Fred McDonald is a
still active Dave. Kate (Eileen Alexander)
and Sandy (Vivian Edwards) are not quite
in the picture, but the rest of the Rudd
family, Mum (Alfreda Bevan), Sarah (Lily
Molloy) and Joe (G. W. Irvine) are
dinkum.

The Vanbrugh-Boncicault coalition having
decided to switch over from “His House in
Order” to the eminently successful “Aren’t

Filmer Jesson, M.P., will be spared further

Tatham will start catching her husband in

The appearance of Chris Charlton at
Sydney Tivoli is a trifle premature. A wise
management would have kept him locked up
until the American Fleet steamed through the
Heads, and then pasted up a poster in every
pub in town. Whereupon the thirsty Yanks
would have stormed the Castlereagh-street
house Just for a glimpse of his magic kettle.
Last Saturday the audience was invited to
call for a drink, and whether it was whisky,
beer, rum, brandy or sherry, it all came out
of the spout of the same little tin pot and
was handed over the footlights for consump-
tion. Another stranger is Tom Clare, a droll
humorist, many of whose monologue turns
have been served up by pirates before lie
reached here. Tom Moore is a passable bari-
tone who lauds the stoker, and Long Tack
Sam and his offsiders supply an elaborate
entertainment in a blaze of Oriental gim-
crackery.

George Wallace has withdrawn his be-
witching ballet from the front line at Syd-
ney Fullers’, and, instead of a revue with a
swaying bevy of beauties, patrons are invited
to swallow this week a show compounded of
drama, burlesque and straight comedy. It
is somewhat disjointed, and George Wallace

himself is developing the bad habit of talking
about George Wallace. The vaudeville side
ranges from Ethel Morrissey, three and a
half, to a couple whose date of birth it
wouldn’t be polite to mention. However, as
the gods emit loud yells of approval be-
tween crunches of peanuts, they all answer
the purpose for which they are there.

“This Woman,” at Sydney Lyceum, bumps
trouble from the start; but after suffering
the indignity of being run in for 20 days for
being what of course the chaste maiden isn’t,
it is discovered that she has a voice; and
everybody lives happily ever after. “Love’s
Wilderness,” which takes up the major part
of the Piccadilly bill, is a story of the South-
ern States. The heroine, an endearing little
lady, unintentionally commits bigamy, and
to save a lot of embarrassihg questions the
scenario writer has the greater of two evils
neatly removed, “The Story Without a
Name,” at the Strand, is as lurid as the
articles in the magazine section of the Sun-
day newspapers. “Don’t Doubt Your Hus-
band” is Hoyt’s latest advice ; which shows
that Hoyt’s don’t know as much as some
Sydney wives know. There is a likeable
little clothes-mender who strides down
“Fools’ Highwmy” at the same house. Larry
Semon, reputed to be a star jester, is at the
Lyric, but even the seven-year-olds who
patronise children’s matindes. say that Law-
rence is slipping. “Ports of Call,” at the
Empress, are uninteresting; “Great Expec-
tations,” at the Rialto, is a poor caricature
of Charles Dickens; the “Ten Command-
ments,” at the Prince Edward, lias reached
twice ten weeks; and “The Sea Hawk,” at
the Crystal Palace, is presenting the man-
agement with a fine nest of golden eggs.

Some echoes and a Voice: —
Carlyle Jackson, an old pupil of Julian Ashton,
has been painting in Melbourne for the past six
years, and has now brought his endeavors back to
Sydney. It is a pity he hasn’t more faith in
himself. No. 14 is a reminiscence of Hans Hey sen,
No. 25 has elements of Hilder, No. 36 is a bad
Claussen, elsewhere Corot is represented, and in
Nos. 8 and 33 Blamire Young is not forgotten.
Nevertheless, a strong thread of fresh and clean
color, sound tone values and clever composition
running through the show may have been spun from
the inner consciousness of Carlyle Jackson himself.
There is a delightful weaving of light and shade in
his valley scenes; in “The Timber Trader”—two
shots—he has dealt faithfully with ships; in No.
37, “Beadh Landscape, Manly,” he has captured
the tones of sea and sand; and in 35, “Hayfields
near Heidelberg,” the detail is as good as the
general structure. The collection, which is housed
at Farmers’, suggests that when the artist has ceased
to be seduced by other voices and listens to the
still, small note that appears to be within him, he
may do great things.

A Sydney show and a £5OO prize:—
A. J. Murch will put £5OO in his pocket and hie
to Europe for two years to complete his education
as a result of the judging of this year’s Society of
Artists’ Scholarship pictures. The shy fowl Imagi-
nation sat on his brush when he executed “Balder,"
his effort in composition; the same bird failed ir u
alight anywhere near the others, which probahh
explains why H. E. Badham, whose technique is
exceedingly good, was only a runner-up. Muich
has technique as well, and shows it in his study of
a nude boy, somewhat morgue-like as to the llesh
tints but sound in moulding, in his portrait of a
tight-lipped old lady and in' a lively bronze, in
devoting its grant from the State to the pur'ixises
of an open competition, the Society of Artists showed
more patriotism than the Royal Art Society, which
pocketed its grant; and there is irony in the fact
that it was an R.A.S. student who carried off the
prize.

Allan Wilkie found “Henry the Fifth,”
'■staged last Friday night, such a winner that
:ui announcement was immediately made
that it would be repeated on Monday, dis-
placing “The Two Gentlemen of Verona.'
The robustious patriotic drama not only
succeeded in filling the Melbourne New
Palace to the last niche, but itself fitted the
company. Allan Wilkie was purposeful as
the King who rises from prayer to wallop
the French, and Miss Hunter-Watts was
charming as Katharine, the style of part
suiting her; and they were greatly helped
by the Alice of Jean Athol. The Fluellen
of Hamilton Henry was fine; and Cecily
Wilson as the Chorus who drifts in to ex-
plain history delivered her lines in a fashion
that well earned the applause she got. George
Rignold could always draw houses witu
“Henry V.,” and Wilkie would probably find
it profitable to fill it out with more pompous
detail than he usually allows himself, and
run it for a season. “The Taming of the
Shrew” was the Saturday bill, and it, too,
went well. The co. is now taking a soft of
’busman’s holiday for a couple of nights
while it rehearses “She Stoops to Conquer.”
Goldsmith’s comedy is no one-night affair;
it will run until the box-office hints that the
public wants a change.

thrust into the background of merely impend-
ing things. Cappy will talk about his dol-

The Two Rascals continue to keep Mel-
bourne Tivoli audiences amused and the
front electrics bright. Additions to the pro-
gramme are Four Jolly Scots (and the
Scotch have a far keener sense of humor
than is alleged if they can see it in some
of the gags), . and an illusionist who fails
to create any illusion that he is in the first

Local color is introduced by Stiffy and
Mo in at least the title of their this week’s
sketch, “At the Police Strike” ; but of course
the couple are just the same old hilarious
nonsense-purveyors. Arthur and Helena
Buckley are new arrivals with a much-the-
same-as-usual telepathy act.
The “Secrets of the Night” are having an
exposure at Hoyt's dc Luxe, and additional
excitement is provided by Zane Grey’s “The
Border Legion.” Women are being lured to
the Majestic by “Reckless Romance,” which
provides more humor than love thrills, how-
ever ; and a Conan Doyle story finds a filming
in Fires of Fate.” At the Capitol, Rudolph
Valentino fails to look anything like the
Monsieur Beaucaire that might have existed
in the period when gentlemen did not wash
but managed a remarkable courtliness.

The concert of the University Symphony
Orchestra drew a crowd which was more
liberal in its applause than some of the work
merited; but the average concert-goer likes
music with Avhich he is familiar, and ivas
give. ll iL Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony lacked
distinction, and there was a certain jerkiness
in the opening.. Later on the wood-wind sec-
tion was inspiring—a contrast to the uneven
tumult of the basses in the Scherzo. In spite
of raggedness in the conclusion, the “Corio-
lanus” overture was better; and making due
allowance, the whole affair was meritorious.
A lack of force and inspiration was the most
striking characteristic of Dorothy Randle’s
pianoforte recital at Melbourne Playhouse
last Friday night. On the credit side were
accuracy and a certain gracefulness in expres-
sion. Miss Randle made her first public
appearance in Melbourne when she was only
seven; she has been to London, and botii
studied and scored some public success there.
It is disappointing that her progress has not
been greater. Her best number was Liszt's
“La Campanella.” A nice contralto was dis-
played in supporting songs by Miss Victoria
Anderson, but she was unable to rise above
a tone monotony which could and should be
remedied.

Adelaide has a striking picture in “The
Thief of Bagdad,” at West’s. It works out
the conviction of Yankee dramatists that a
criminal Turning to the Right is the best
possible hero, especially if you cast him amid
Chu Chin Chow surroundings. Douglas
Fairbanks does some stunts, but his per-
sonality is almost overhadowed later by pan-
tomime properties. Also the management—
as in other houses just now—has gone to a
lot of expense to stage a prologue, with live
singers, but it does not seem to add much to
the effect. Wondergraph appeals to women
with “A Forbidden Paradise.” and the York
does so frankly with “In Every Woman’s
Biff;-” The Royal is closed; but the P. of
Wales keeps the spoken drama going. George
Cross gives a really fine rendering of the
modern Fiend in Corelli’s old “Sorrows of
Satan,” and Lesley Adrienne is the lady who
gets vamped. An Australian play is to follow.
“S. Gumm”; Pauline Frederick, who got
a mayoral reception in Sydney, is a native of
Boston, Mass., like the Rev. Jonah Witch-
roaster and other eminent Puritans of times
past. There is no other point of resem-
blance. For a decade or more Pauline was
known in America as a sprightly actress who
could hold her own in the singing depart-
ment. She took such parts as Titania in
A Princess of Kensington,” Lady Rowena
Eggington in “When Knights Were Bold,”
Elsie Vernette in “Samson,” and Zuleika in
Joseph and His Brethren.” Then, in April,
1915, she went on the cinema stage, where
she was certainly streets ahead of most of
the picture-“actresses” whose antics have
been seen on Australian screens. Her re-
turn to the legitimate will be made in “A
Spring Cleaning.” by Frederick Lonsdale,
who wrote “King of Cadonia,” “High
Jinks, “Maid of the Mountains” and
Aren t We All?” Pauline has been mar-
ried at least twice, her second (or more)
husband jheing Willard Mack (otherwise
Charles W. McLaughlin), actor and writer
of many plays, none of them seen in Aus-
tralia. She is Willard’s third venture.

“Caul-boy”: Galli-Curci resembles a bird
in more particulars than in her flute-like and
unimpassioned singing. When she runs on
and off the stage, her light Gaiety-skirts
flaring out behind, she reminds me of that
feathered biped whose finest feathers make
ladies’ fans. When she comes up after a,
long draught of song, her quick little pecks
to right and left recall a sparrow at a
saucer of water. She has her charms, but
it is not the voluptuous appeal of a Dal
Monte. It calls more to the impersonal
feeling of wonder—the sensations that a bird
of paradise evokes.
“Lysander”: Though there may be a
thought too much Wilkie about the Shaks-
peare Allan Wilkie is discovering to Aus-
tralia, certain encouraging facts are notice-
able as a result of the painstaking Scot\s
work. Audiences are eager to see Wilkie's
coimpany, because it provides an enjoyable
well-done show, not because it is “the thing”
to patronise Shakspeare; and school-children
are actually wanting to see Shakspeare
played. This despite scenery reduced al-
most to mere diagram, and costuming which
grows very familiar to the spectator who
sees out the whole Wilkie series of 21
plays. Cast changes during Wilkie’s 1925
season have led the liypercritics to find fault
with the elocution-class flavor of present
leads’ work; but, after all, much of Shaks-
peare is poetry to be declaimed rather than
living speech to be spoken, and the juveniles
may be forgiven.
“Flaming Youth”: A certain mystery
about an imported play enabled a theatrical
producer to make his marble good- Shortly
after the piece had
been put Unto re-
hearsal the .manage-
ment and the per-
formers wpndered
why it had ever
been selected: but
there wa s no
chance of checking
the suspicion that
there had been a
huge blunder in
making the copies,
the original script
having mysteriously
disappeared. Then
the producer got in
some good work.
He interrupted the
rehearsals to inter-
polate gags he had
thought out in the
bath or at break-
fast ; and soon the
script and parts
had the appearance
o f b eing com-
pletely re-written.
They were so greatly
altered, in fact,
that ne w copies
were made. The
result was an amaz-
ingly good play
which, when staged
in earnest, went
with a bing. Natu-
rally the perdoocer
got large credit
from a management
which had been in-
clined to regard him
as a dud. His secret
was discovered
when a couple of
actors accidentally
came upon the
original script. At
great pains, ’and
with much labor to
the co., he had
worked in an emas-
culated dum m y
script, and im-
proved it up to the
standard of the real play, and, incidentally,
established a reputation as a useful man.
But they didn’t blab.
“Hamer”: A roomier hall is to rise out
of the ashes of the old inadequate concert
hall of Melbourne’s civic edifice. To find
space for a hall to hold 3000 people the
Victoria Coffee Palace, the lease of which
falls in this year, is to be taken over. The
decision kills, for some years at least, the
agitation of those who want the Town Hall
to take a complete change into the country.
“C. 1.5.”: I can tell “Pan’s Pipe” what
became of that “Panorama of the American
Civil War” (B. 26/3/’25). It was dis-
played at Cole’s Book Arcade, Melbourne,
in 1885, being hung on the bookshelves on
the first floor. There it was afterwards used
as covering-up cloths, and in the end was
consigned to the rubbish-bin.
“Schnorrer” : This is the true tale of Mos-
covitch’s introduction to the English-speaking
stage. He had been playing in Yiddish for
20 years all over Europe, and was still at
the old game in the East End of Eondon
when an English manager made a point
of seeing him at the show-place of the Chosen.
Immensely impressed, the manager suggested
tliat *llO act° r should try Shylock. Mosco-
\Uclis English was very weak at the time-
even now, in ordinary conversation, he talks
like one whose tongue is feeling its foot-
steps, so to speak. Rut six weeks after he
nad decided to accept the advice he was
appearing as the Jew that Shakspeare drew.
“Flaming Youth”; Where Stiffv and Mo
now exchange badinage some very line com-
panies visiting Melbourne showed in davs
past. Rrough and Roucicault were tenant-
ing the old theatre, on the site of which the
Rijou now stands, when the place was burnt
down m 1880. The arcade underneath, now
devoted entirely to the business of the vaude-
ville show, was once the haunt of youth and
near-beauty. In the days of almost nn-
-1 egulated pubs beer was sold on a counter
opening on the arcade, and the drinker could
kiss the barmaid behind the counter for the
change. There were many barmaids, none
belonging to the Dorcas Society, and there
were palm-readers, herbalists, tattoo-artists
and other practitioners of odd professions.
It was a queer old alley of sin, but it has
long since acquired the respectability now
typified by Stiffy and Mo.
/ ‘‘Sparc Corporal”: Madame Tussaud’s
(I>. 26/3/’25) was invariably included in the
sightseeing trips arranged by the kindly
people who looked after the happiness of
Diggers on leave in London. On one jaunt
a clergyman who was to act as guide was
hailed in a friendly fashion by a rough dia-
mond over from France for the first time.
"1 never thought a parson could be such a
blanky sport,” said Rough-as-bags, heartily.
“Air wot sorta tarts are they at this joint
of Madame’s?” His new respect for the
sporting character of the clergy slumped
when he learned that Tussaud’s was not the
sort of “Madame’s” lie had encountered in
some French towns.
“Ha inf at ; The coming of a new theatrical
combination has given the Ward-Fullers a
chance to get the Melbourne New Palace off
their hands on a lease. It will also enable
an Australian composer to get a local airing
for three revues which met with success in
London, where “Puss Puss” ran for seven
months and “Snap’’ and “Pot Luck” for some
time longer. Kenneth Duffield, a South Aus-
tralian, is the composer in question, and he
had Dion Tithcfadge to help him. Duffield,
who rose to a captaincy in the war, and after
it was over drifted back to London, has re-
turned to Australia and is a prime mover
in the new concern. With him is Howett
Worster. who has parted from the William
son firm.
“Minim”; I cannot go so far with “Char-
lik (R. 2/4/’25) as to say that Edward
German lacked humor as a composer of light
opera. He lacked only the fun-suggesting
librettist. _ The man who could give us the
l’ichly-comic “Jolly Sailormen” of “The Prin-
cess of Kensington,” the various country
dances for which he is famous, and several
of the numbers in his least-known work, “Tom
Jones,” could surely respond to any humorous
notion of his collaborators. Rut, unfortu-
nately, stodginess was the badge of all their
tribe. Sullivan was not a humorist until he
settled down to work with Gilbert. His
earliest inclinations were towards the com-
posing of "Lost Chords” and oratorios.
“Pitt Street Pro”: It would not be sur-
prising to find that the lady’s managers have
overdone the Pauline Frederick boom. The
picture-crazed public who have been so de-
monstrative at her carefully stage-managed
receptions may cool off when they see her
in a speaking part. And Pauline’s part in
her opening play is by no means the show-
iest in the piece. Of course it’s a manager’s
business to boost his stars, but unless the
performers make their bows in oleaginous
r6les, the fat, so to speak, is in the fire.
For patrons always associate the part with
the actor, and if the part is not good they
are inevitably disappointed.
“Hasen”: Since seeing Moscovitch, Badger
had never stopped talking about wdiat an
artist the man was. We became quite used
to the opening, “That Russian chap” or
“That Pole (or Jew),” for Badger could
never remember the name and was hazy
about the nationality of his hero. Mostly we
rushed to agree with him, but I was sur-
prised to hear Smith do so. Smith’s idea of
amusement is even more low in the brow
than mine. “Seen that Jeiv feller what’s
his name?” I heard Badger begin. “Jolly
fine, isn’t he?” said Smith. “Why, man.”
breathed Badger impressively, “he’s wonder-
ful. There’s been no one like him for years.
He” “That’s wdiat I say,” broke in
Smith enthusiastically. “Can’t understand
people saying they don’t like him.” “Igno-
rant louts, hissed Badger savagely. “Haven’t
got the brains to appreciate him.” Then
followed a long duet of praise, mostly unin-
telligible until some minutes later 1 heard
Smith say, “Why, the last time I saw him I
laughed myself sick.” “Laughter?” muttered
Badger, weakly. “Yes,” burbled Smith. “Re-
member when he says. 'She's some sheila
dinkum, boy!’ and”—“Good God!” gasped
Badger. “Who’re you talking about?”
“Why,” said Smith, “Mo, of course, and
Stiffy says” But at that point Badger
fainted.
NIGHT LIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The night is turned to noon where flows the throbbing
human tide,
The headlights of the motors glare and glance;
The flaming serpents flicker where ttie movie doors
swing wide
To glut an avid public with Romance.
Lights that blaze and lights that quiver, rippling
lights on bap and river,
Lights beneath whose purple shadows crouch the
flotsam of defeat;
Lights, like lidless eyes unwinking
Such as drug the mind from thinking,
And we stagger, dazed and blinking.
From the street.
The heavens declare in sky-line ads. what whisky
we should drink,
Or what a wise man fancies in cigars;
Above the roaring city streets the fiery letters blink ;
A milky glare obliterates the stars.
ALL IN THE DAY’S WORK.
THE STAGE LADY: “ Wherever did I get these awful cigarettes?”
HER SISTER: “ Don’t you remember, dear? Those are some you
gave the testimonial to last week.”
Night utters speech to-night in signs of “Eat More
Citrus Fruit” ;
Or “Buy Australian Goods” or “Eat More Cheese” ;
Or “Extra Pair of Trousers Given Free with Every
Suit”—
Publicity has banned the Pleiades.
Lights that deal in dressy notions, lights that tell
of pills and potions,
Lights that spell, in dancing letters, ivhat to eat
and drink and wear •
Lights that leap from their concealing
Till they leave the senses reeling,
Mammon’s merchandise revealing
From the air.
But far from glare and tumult in the ghostly forest
aisles
The pillared gums are white beneatli the moon;
And over mossy ways that wind for unremembered
miles
The stars unhindered spell their mystic rune.
A square of yellow lamplight, and a wisp of smoke
that wings
Above a roof most intimate and dear—
’Tis the light of love and welcome, and the joy of
simple things,
When night brings rest and God is very near.
VICTORIA.

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted: and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Country P.: But if you sent in a ticket
whose butt hadn’t been returned to the “art union”
promoters, you’d have no hope of getting a prize.
Only marbles represented by butts go into the barrel:
that’s where the check comes in....W.R.: Thanks,
quite right. Hoskinstown (B. 19/3/’25) was on the
Captain’s Flat road, some miles from Canberra....
G. Wint: We’ve seen brighter stuff thrown up out
of one of your mudsprings.... H. Washer: Pack of
rubbish A.H.C.: Glad to hear from you, but
the rubbish has had as much attention as it deserves.
. ...R.H.S.: It clatters like a jazz band in a rail-
way accident... .W. B. Maori land: The door is shut.
....John E. C.: No, it plainly ought to go to the
other paper... .H.G.B.: Hardly strong enough for
its length. But you ought to have some good
paragraphs in your fountain-pen... .M. 11.H.: Good
subject, nat made the most of... .Bus-misser: Printed
at last:—
Now I am like the author Blank,
1, too, spin sagas red ;
Tin; Bulletin has hopes that I
Will blanky well drop dead.
But, gents, 1 am the new Shakspeare—
My works will stir all climes.
Old Blank’s book came from one “Please die I”
They’ve asked me fifty times!
. ...G.M.: The pigeon yarn was told in the Ark....
Irene P.: “The Poet” is poor stuff; but the “Echo”
verse may be good when you can handle it better...
Longing: Not up to standard A.M.B.B.: Nothing
in any of this lot. .. .G.E.M.: “The Sea” fails....
E.M.S.: None of them quite gets through.... Hugh
S.; Poor little thing repeating a point that has been
made so often... .E.K.R.: No use to this six-
penn’orth... .Vincent C.: It is too weak and thin.
. ...W.McM.: A poor sort of noise to make at this
time of day... .T.A.S.: Nothing printable there....
E.Y. (Lakemba): Misses, but the marksmanship is
very fair. Try again.... J.S.S.: Not enough thought;
not enough skill... .Bellerive: The “Tramp Hero”
is in your best style:—
As flames did burst from a wooden house
A tramp from the roadside shade
Baffled he’s way thro’ flames and smoke
Before the arrival of a Are Brigade.
He rescued from the burning mass,
And wafting cheers did sound.
Brigades appeared upon the scene,
And a crowd did gather round.
“’Twas a risky job,” the tramp exclaimed,
“For a man of fifty-three;
The Mother’s piteous cries aroused
The daredevil spirit in Me.”
He’d staked he’s life to save the child.
And wandered away alone,
A hero of the down and outs,
Gaunt, homeless and unknown.
. ...T.B. (Brisbane): A vivid enough fragment, but
it doesn’t make a yarn... .N.D.R.; Not for us....
E.H.M.; It works to a mechanical ending on the old
lines W.J.T.: The change of metre in each stanza
is too violent... .O.B.I.: None of them hit us hard
enough. .. .Billy S.: A poor yarn and not well told.
... .J.A.K.: This is too crowded a paper for rambling
stuff of that kind... .Michael 0.: Misses... .H.J.G.:
An old yarn in a setting that does not improve it.
P.R.M.; Makes a poor sermon M.H.H.: Yarn
too obviously manufactured. The art lies in re-
moving the traces of the machine tools. .. .Jazzer:
It may be true, but you have made it a dull story.
. ...R.C. (Brisbane): The one-eyed horse is a weary
animal... .A.J.H.; Not much merit in it... .H.J.G.:
Right off our beat. ... J.A.Ii.: The “Gap” story is
far too improbable. .. .T.N.T.: Not well enough done.
....Robert N.: The verse is crude. You'll have to
put more work into it to get it through J.R.L.:
The effort to achieve mirth is too obvious. And
the form of the verse doesn't help Ethel D.:
Dcn’t care for “Aspirations”... .C.C.: “The Flapper”
says nothing new and doesn’t say it well ... .W.H.R.:
“Discovery” hasn’t enough interest... .C.W. (Manly) :
The sonnet is passable. The others fall down heavily
in places.... Plodder: They must go back... .A.S.B.:
“The Brook” is a very commonplace stream....
Ripponlea; The lament of the bath is a moving
ditty:—
As I take my bath of a Saturday night,
And with splotches of soap my face is white,
My goat it does get
And my style it does cramp,
As I crawl around wet
And a towel I can’t lamp ;
I almost feel inclined to cry
When I get some soap in mine eye.
I blunder and bellow and wallow and grope
And curse the man that invc nted soap.
I open a lid
Then emit a howl;
Make a desperate bid
And grab the towel.
’Tis crook, dear reader, I’m sure you'll agree,
When you get some soap in your e’e.
....Helen R.: Such outpourings of words are alto-
gether unreal... .Edmund D.; It runs smoothly
enough, but never shows any distinction; and the
matter is mostly commonplace.. ..Judith R.: Read
some good verse and don’t make statements that are
absurd. The Southern Cross is by no means supreme
in the southern skies.... D.F.E.: The lines are very
rugged and say precious little....????: It would be
much easier to read if constructed in grammatical
sentences... .W.E.B.: Not up.... Label: Jerry-built
verse without a fresh idea... .R.L.C.: Sad rubbish.
, ...Frank N.: A feeble little flutter.... Butten D.:
Better write to the paper that was victimised....
..R.: “Mrs. Beaume” would consume too much space.
.... Tubby: Sent to the tip. Whatever have we
printed to make you think we would print a thing
like that?....John J. D. (and 50 others): Alas and
alas, and Oswald Pryor thought he was getting in
a humorous touch when he made the young man
struggle with the bride’s wrong hand.
TO ART 16 llC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
O.M.G.: Your “first attempt at publicity” must
look for an opening elsewhere... .S.G.R.: Specimens
submitted don’t indicate an unsuspected Phil May.
. ...D.C.: Your notions of how small boys look
and talk, also the general demeanor of lamp-posts
in public places, are not lacking in originality. ...
J.S.: You don’t fully illustrate your idea.... J.R.V.:
You are not so bad as to merit death by the slow
slicing process; nor so good as to make this paper
want to risk anything on you yet.
“D.D.D.”: Many of the railway fettlers
along the way-back section of the Q.C.R.,
beyond Barcaldine, make full use of the
sub-tropical climate. They grow and cure tbe-'r
own tobacco, and in some cases produce their
own coffee, whip' many of f bc humifies are
now surrounded by cotton bushes—the raw
fibre comes in handy tor stuffing mattresses
f! r>d pGinws. Experiments are also being
made with tea.

In addition to recording speed and mileage, this Stewart Patented Speedometer for Ford Cars indicates by means of colored figures
when different parts of the Car should be lubricated.
Each instrument has a neat metal tablet attached, to which the driver can refer for oiling instructions whenever a colored dial turns
up on the mileage register. A stiff-covered pocket-book containing illustrated lubrication chart, with ruled pages for recording
petrol and oil purchases,' is furnished with each instrument.
Whenever a colored
dial appears, the
hinged chart should be
pulled down and the
needed lubrication
attended to.
This Patented Stewart Speedometer automatically informs the Ford Car driver whenever it
necessary to oil or grease any part of his car. There is no guess-work—no uncertainty or worry—i
troublesome investigation of inaccessible parts.
The Stewart Oiling System Speedometer does
your remembering for you.

“Uramao”: Financial institutions that
have been buying M.L. municipal and Gov-
ernment bonds found that the securities were
beginning to crowd out the strongrooms. A
law has now made it possible for these insti-
tutions to consolidate their holdings into a
single debenture of any amount. Under the
supervision of Audit Department and other
officials live cases crammed with 5cwt. of
£100 bonds went, up in smoke the other day.

“Sucre”: 1 accepted a three days post-
dated cheque from a customer, and in due
course paid it into my banking account. It
came back to me with the recommendation
“Refer to drawer.” I did, only to learn that
the drawer had no account at this bank or
any other. She—it was a lady—was candor
personified over the transaction. I con-
sulted a lawyer, who told me there were no
grounds for criminal prosecution. “She gave
you a promissory note,” said Costs, “and it's
dishonored, that’s all.” I suppose this is
correct, but it seems a startling view.
“H.D.”: Another English co. lias been
formed to convert Nor'-West turtles (W.A.)
into soup and other products. Capital is
£15,000 in £1 shares, of which the vendors,
who are not uamed, take a third and 2500
are held in reserve. The prospectus speaks
of a yearly profit of £13,000 from the treat-
ment of five turtles a day. The promoters
declare that this estimate is conservative
and that in addition to turtles there are many
things in the sea where the co. pro-
poses to fish that can be turned to profit.
They add that prospects are “teeming with
great possibilities.” Bill _»enstead, an old
Coolgardiean, is manager, and his entourage
includes a Parisian chef.

“Mako” : A race against time was won the
other day by the steamer Koromiko, which
after loading 5000 tons of wheat in Mel-
bourne for Maoriland ports was delayed in
her departure by strike troubles. Ordinarily
the vessel would have arrived well ahead of
time, and thus avoided by a good margin the
new wheat duty of £2 4s. per ton. The
Government refused to consider the question
of remitting the impost should the vessel be
late, and the Koromiko received a wireless
appeal to hurry up and escape being required
to pay £10,000 to the Customs. Crowding
on all possible speed she passed the port
limit in Auckland at 11.20 p.m. The extra
duty was assessable at midnight, so time
was money to the extent of about £250 per
minute.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Crumbling now under the
breaker’s hammer, Monahan’s Buildings.
Swanston-street, which ranked as proud evi-
dence of Melbourne’s progress when the place
was opened a few years ago. The building
cost £50,000 and ran up to five storeys on
walls 3ft. thick at the base, with a massive
front of granite piers; but already it is con-
sidered good business to scrap the lot and
throw up a steel and concrete building with
mostly six-inch walls running to 11 storeys.
The salvage of materials goes to pay the
wrecker. It is all he will get; but as the
value of salvaged material he will use in
the construction of a factory in South Mel-
bourne is estimated at £14,000, and there will
still be some to spare,, he isn’t feeling sorry
for himself.
* * * «
“Sixenate” : Costs in Tasmania has taken
its cut out of an ambergris find of 30 years
ago. Black Louis and Black James found
the stuff on the beach near Port Davey, and
David Barclay, manager of the old Commer-
cial Bank of Tasmania, marketed it, without
asking a penny for his trouble, and very ad
vantageously for the two colored gents, who
found themselves with £6000 to cut up
between them. Black Louis died recently,
and by his will, dated 1915, left a remain-
ing £2000 to the daughters of Barclay, pre-
sumably out of gratitude to the banker.
Costs came in upon the action of a step-
daughter who thought she had a claim. She
had married a Chinaman, to whose color
Black Louis objected so strongly that he cut
her out of his will. The final verdict was
in favor of the banker’s daughters.

“Troophorse”: The pearling industry in
the Northern Territory is at last receiving
attention from Broome (W.A.). Several
months ago Jim Clark sent three luggers
round to Darwin to prospect the grounds.
Several old patches in the local harbor, un-
touched since pre-war days, gave results suf-
ficiently promising to induce him to set 15
boats at work in the vicinity. For some
unknown reason Jap divers have been sailing
of late far down the coast, instead of work-
ing the grounds handy to port. Patches off
Melville Island where good shell was obtained
before the war have not been touched since.
Last year Captain Edwards was the only
pearler working Darwin, and his nect com-
prised only two luggers. In pre-war days
Jolly and Co. used to work something like a
dozen boats, while several smaller companies
operated. Territory shell has always been
high grade, though healthy pearls have been
scarce.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Two wives of a Constantinople Turk on the same
day gave birth to twins and a third wife simultane-
ously gave birth to triplets.”— Cable.
Young Farmer Smith, on whom the Stork
Has just bestowed a bouncing pair,
Rests for a moment 0:1 his fork
To breathe a fervent, heartfelt prayer
(For babies must be pacified, • •>
And soothing them’s each night his work):
“With these two I’m quite ' satisfied—
My oath, I’m glad I’m not a Turk.”
But Farmer Brown, who has been wed
For many years (at least a score),
Works the sum out, then rubs his head—
The total fills his mind with awe.
“A bloke would want a biggish house;
But with that lot of kids to work
We sure could milk a lot of cows—
My oath, f wish I was a Turk!”
QUEENSLAND.

yet expedient PERFORATED
HONE solves the question per-
manently ; it provides a life-
time of easy shaving for a
6mall outlay—only 5/-, or post

Maoriland may have a very celebrated
name in its list of M’s.P. after next election.
One of the candidates for the Thames is
W. E. Gladstone Willy.
“Toy Wheel” : Hats off to John Cowan, of
Tatham, Richmond River (N.S.W.). A
famous breeder of Jersey cattle, he has pre-
sented every Digger in his district (45 alto-
gether, and practically all dairy-farmers)
with a bull calf. And with every Channel
Islander arrived a certificate to the effect
that he was bred from some of the best
strains in Australia.
Just died, at Emu Park (Q.), Harry John-
son, who called himself a hotelier. He was
a maker of slogans as far back as IS9O. One
of his best was on the programme of an
opera co. appearing in the Theatre Royal,
opposite the Belmore Arms, Rockhampton.
It was one of Rocky’s hot nights; and over
Johnson’s ad. on the programme were the
words: “Everything iced at the Belmore ex-
cept the welcome.”
“Baju”: One of the Sydney Sunday news-
papers every week “writes up” a school, and
gives a list of its famous old boys. These
lists are illuminating as showing what makes
for greatness. The latest had IS old boys
in it. They included the proprietor of a
wine saloon, the keeper of a suburban hotel,
a couple of Water Board officials, a Treasury
official, a storekeeper or two, a couple of
vets, a dentist and Walter Marks. M.11.R.
“Gigadibs”; How’s this for an Australian?
He’s a fitter and turner in the Vic. Railways,
aged IS, and the eldest of a large family. He
kept house when his widowed mother was in
hospital. He bathed the babies and cooked
Irish stew, scones and pastry. He has
taught himself to play the piano, and
puts in his nights doing a tech,
school diploma course in mechanical
engineering, one more year to go. He plays
a good forward game with his home football
team, and risks his life every Sunday after-
noon on a concoction he’s turned and fitted
out of five old scrapped motor-bikes of dif-
ferent makes.
Dear Bulletin, —Something was for-
gotten in the tale about “The Natural Re-
sources of Erin” (B. 12/3/’25). The little
Irish Free State, about the size of Tasmania,
really keeps two (2) Chief Justices at £5OOO
a year, one described as “Lord” and one as
“President.” One is “High” and the other
“Supreme.” Then there are the two £4OOO
Judges and the five £3500 Judges. The last
named, who seem comparatively minor per-
sons, are thus paid the same as Australia’s
Federal Chief Justice. The whole outfit,
when everything is in working order, is to
consist of “District Justices’ Courts, Circuit
Courts, a High Court, a Criminal Appeal
Court and a Supreme Court of Appeal.” The
famine hasn’t reached the Bench yet—Yours,
etc., Henry Horsecollar.
“Nitric”: What Bananalander will not
remember “Old Dan” Hawke, who has just
passed out at Emu Park, the oldest inhabi-
tant of Central Q., aged (so they say) 105?
He came to Queensland from China (he was
full Chinese) over 70 years ago, and kept a
store and a hotel at Tungamull in the coach-
ing days. In the big drought of the ’eighties
Dan displayed a sign stating that rations
could be procured free of charge by out of
works; and he spent hundreds of pounds on
doctors for persons who were ill and needy.
His affection for British ways and institu-
tions was overwhelming; he treasured the
Union Jack in which he was wrapped at his
own request when buried, according to the
rites of the Anglican Church. Dan had one
heavy loss. He had put £5OO in notes away
in a box. Thirty years afterwards he looked
at them to find they were dust.
“Dalba” : The new chum had been a clerk
in a London office before he came to Aus-
tralia to worry the soul out of the wharfin-
ger on the N.S.W. North Coast pier where
he was given a semi-laborer’s job. The
wharfinger was directing the fixing of a
tarpaulin over some goods, and Chum,
being more or less in the way, was ordered
to go to the ship and bring off a few chocks,
lie looked worried, but his ceaseless ques-
tions had called forth so much lurid lan-
guage that he took a risk. He returned
with a crate of fowls, saying “’Ere boss, y*
better take your own pick.” That nearly
cost him his job, but he was forgiven until,
a fortnight later, a couple of trestles were
needed. The waterside term for these is
horses. Chum brought off the ship a nag
that had cost much worry and effort to get
aboard. He has a job in the country now.
“Simon”: Donald Walter Croal, out of the
Service but still protesting, has got more
excitement from a small circumstance than
most people wmuld think possible. During
the ’flu’ scare a few years ago he was a
teller in the H.O. of the N.S.W. Government
Savings Bank. ' When the proclamation to
wear masks w T as issued his John Hampden
spirit was aroused, and he refused in a voice
like Magna Chajrta. If he wore one he’d be
paralysed; if he didn’t he’d be arrested. So,
fighting a rearguard action, he retreated
within his own house. He reasoned that he
was thus a prisoner, and that there was a
breach of the Habeas Corpus Act. Not an
M.L.A. at the time escaped either him or
his grievance, and in sportive mood they
agreed to hear him at the Bar of the
House. Hansard dedicated a great many
pages to a speech that should be one of the
most extraordinary in Australian history.
“X2X”: For years past there has been
a bitter controversy between some of the
scientific societies of Australia and the
pharmaceutical societies of the various
States over the use of the term “chemist.”
The scientists contend that the title belongs
to them and that the proper designation of
the pill-makers is “pharmacist,” a claim
which is vigorously contested by men of thy
pestle. About four years ago the Aus-
tralian Chemical Society unsuccessfully
attempted to have the use of the word
“chemist” reserved to its members by a
Federal charter. It had right on its side,
too. A chemist is one who either studies
matter and the different forms and phases
in which it exists, together with the forces
responsible for these forms, or uses the
forces in the industrial preparation of
various compounds, the two activities some-
times being combined in these enlightened
days. On the other hand, a pharmacist is
one whose job is to compound medicines
and drugs at the direction of a physician.
The distinction is clearly recognised in
almost every other country in the world.

Mr. Compton Mackenzie—
Well-known author, fearless critic and
Editor of “THE GRAMOPHONE”
(England),
writes in that journal as follows:—•
“I have been enormously impressed by my
first experience with the Edison instrument and
Edison Records. The first thing that got me
was the piano record. I have never heard any
piano record to touch it for realism. I then
tried Claudia Muzio in a couple of arias, and
I could not believe it was the same voice I had
heard attributed to her on other records. A
harp record was astonishing. As for jazz bands,
all the jazz bands I have heard on the gramo-
phone sound like tin kettles by comparison. I
am pretty hard bitten in the way of gramophone
improvements, but the jazz bands of the Edison
HAVE AMAZED ME.”


MAKES
SHAVING
A PLEASURE!
REXONA
Here is a new idea in Shaving Soap—another Rexona triumph
—one this time which will be appreciated by men wherever beards
grow. Rexona Shaving Soap contains the same Oils and Essences
that have made Rexona famous the world over, and is made on
the Rexona formula, and thus makes a Shaving Stick which is a
soap and lotion combined.
Rexona Shaving Stick (medicated) is Rexona Soap especially
treated so as to produce a thick creamy lather,
which will soften the beard and improve the
skin at the same time.
It is delicately perfumed and medicated
on the same principles as Rexona, and not
only produces a lasting lather, but purifies
and leaves the skin in perfect condition.
Being an antiseptic Medicated Soap, it
has a tendency to quickly heal any cut you
may have the misfortune to get, and if
troubled with pimples or blotches of any
kind, will daily tend to remove them.
Rexona Shaving Soap is packed in deco-
rated pure aluminium containers, which are
strong, liqht and durable and will not rust,
and which keep the shaving soap in perfect
condition.

Thrall.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I MADE a little pipe of dreams.
With curious cunning fashioned fair,
To shape life’s laughter into themes
That mock the scourge of care.
“I will be happy now,” I said,
“As Day’s blue, arching flame above,
My hungering heart your lips have fed;
I am your' thrall, dear love!”
“How joyous now shall be my songs,
Who taste the strange wine of your kiss!
I have forgotten all time’s wrongs
And all things else but this.”
All, yet so sad it was, alas!
No laughter wakened when 1 played;
At heart I felt a chill wind pass
That stirred not leaf and blade!
Sweetheart! what strange god’s sorcery
Sang through the simple reed of mine
That broke my heart with melody
Of Passion’s grief divine?
Around me, fairer far than dreams.
Wild wattle sings its golden spell;
O’er seas of sapphire shadow gleams
Day’s burning azure bell.
And evermore a shadow .Mays
To mock the loveliness I see.
That bids me sing in sombre praise
Of love’s dark mystery.
Why must I love you overmuch?
1 ever held that dreams are best.
You wake with your frail fingers' touch
Fierce longings, fierce unrest.
Ah, I who love you hate you too!
The carven amber of your hair,
Your pagan eyes of lapis blue
And all that makes you fair.
For you have netted fast my soul,
And lighted at your beauty’s lire
Within my heart a glowing coal
Of pitiless desire.
You shone between me and my dreams,
And I foreswore them murmuring "This
Dim valley of enchanted streams
Is well lost for your kiss.”
'Twerc well if I might drown and die
Deep in your eyes, dark pools of blue;
For all my dreams are wrought awry,
And love holds hatred too.
There is so little you can give
Beyond the range of common things—
A passion that the years outlive,
A kiss that sears and stings.
Yet, sweet, I cannot let you go,
Though, haply, you grow weary too
Of love’s eternal puppet show —
Masked mummers, I and you !
For we are many, and not one.
A thousand women through your eyes
Laugh hack the splendor of the sun,
Swift changing shadow-wise.
Erst you were Columbine and I
Sad Harlequin, a-smile through pain—
Love’s jester who, scarce knowing why,
Must still pursue in vain.
Though sometimes, when through echoing
room
Or corridor I called your name,
I’d find, to lose in purple gloom,
Your lips of coral flame.
Then I besought the Demiurge:
“O shadow of a fate unknown!
Give me this woman, let me merge
Her being with mine own.”
I turned, and you were smiling there
With eyes love-warm and lapis-bright,
The scented amber of your hair
Unbound for my delight.
“I will be happy now,” I said.
“Say, rather,” laughed the voice supreme,
“Farewell to happiness instead,
0 bondman to a dream!”

The Bad Man from Goondiwindi.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LIJCK had sent the Bad Man from Goon-
diwindi back to Quartpot after only
a month of absence. He came out of
the West again; but it was the Near West,
down the Macintyre below his home town,
which he saw but at a distance as he drove
a mere five hundred head of mixed cattle
eastward. He trucked them at the cattle
siding on the railroad beyond Quartpot, and
then returned to Denny Deneen’s hotel as
if he remembered a previous harmless royster-
ing there, and wanted more of it. And he
had been in Quartpot for a week of quiet
drinking with anybody who was handy as
a guest. Denny had observed the Bad Man
increasing the excise and inland revenue
from the second day of his stay; but Denny
always shunned the drinker, although he
did not abhor the drinker’s money. And
the full week had gone before Denny spoke
to the Bad Man, and then opened conver-
sation only because the Bad Man sang some-
thing that reminded Denny of an earlier
home.
While the Bad Man sang that he had been
“taken and tried and committed and sent
out to Botiny Bay, and as the Judge on
him passed sentence, why, these were the
words he did say,” Denny, reading the litera-
ture of brewers’ and spirit merchants’ in-
voices, had cursed the Bad Man’s music with
curses not loud but deep. And then his
mental attitude to the Bad Man changed as
the Bad Man sang:—
“Oh! there was a man lived in Ililrush
An’ "sure his name was Michael Bush;
He had one son, his Teddy dear,
An’ ’twas him that was fond of a drop of beer—
Musha ding dong da
Fol di riddle da,
My son Teddy musha ding dong da.”
“Musha ding dong da,” hummed Denny in
close sympathy. “Poor man, Goondiwindi!
God help him ! Drinkin like that an singin
like that! He has trouble of his own, poor
man, lias Goondiwindi.” ,
The Bad Man. to the audience of the
empty street, he having earlier put all his
guests out of action, abandoned music tor
the drama by changing the chanson for the
recitative. He declaimed loudly :
“Oh! Phadrig Crohure was the broth of a hoy,
An’ he shtood six feet eight; .
An’ at drinkin’ or fightin’ or takin’ his joy
’Tis Phadrig was great.
Bring me a rum. Mitchell grass an Flin-
ders grass, they say; but give me belah
country—belah and coolibah.”
"Phadrig was great.” repeated Denny.
“Goondiwindi was well brought up, anny-
ways.” . . .
The Bad Man again burst into song, his
liquor having for the moment pulled out
the sympathetic stop in his vocal organs;
and Denny heard that sincere song of sorrow
and of loss :
“I’m sitting by the stile, Mary,
Where we sat side by side
In the bright May morning long ago,
When first you were my bride,”
Denny arose and tiptoed to the hall, and
then to the hotel-door; and there lie saw
Goondiwindi, still singing, his eyes closed
and tears distilling by the eyelashes and fall-
ing on his face : —-
“The corn was springin’ fresh an’ green
An’ the lark sang loud an’ high.
And the bloom was on your cheeks, Mary,
And the lovelight in your eye.”
“Shteady! Shteady!” said Denny, stand
ing by the Bad Man. “Take a pull at your-
self, me poor lad. Singin' that ould song
warmed me to you,” he added, with a sus-
picious brokenness in his voice. “Poor ould
Goondiwindi! An’ lost, a girl yourself in
your time, poor man !”
“The on’y girl I ever loved. Lost her, l
did." sobbed Goondiwindi. “My oath, I
did.”
“Come you inside to your room, Goondi-
windi. an' go to your bed; an’ lave the
dhrink alone for wan day, an’ to-morrer
you’ll be as sober as a judge isn’t, an’ sing-
in’ like a fine little bird upon a bough. ’Tis
a good, sliwate voice God gave you. Goondi-
windi, an’ He wouldn’t like it if He knew
yon was tearin’ holes in it wit’ rum. Come
to your bed, me lad, then.”
“Me poor Tilly,” sobbed Goondiwindi.
“Poor girl!”
“Ah, she’s dead, is she? Poor lad !”
“No fear! Married inspector noosanees
—down at Bourke, on Darlin’ River.”
“Dear, dear! Well, well! But that
needn’t make you kill yourself, me lad.
Wimmin grow like herbs —two crops a_ year.
Sober you up an' go an’ find a wife to
shteady yon.”
“Nobody’d have me,” said the melancholy
Bad Man.
“Arfh! Talk sense! Why, Bill Putti-
foot. a little ould, baldy-headed wliisp of a
butcher man—he’s as ugly as your sore toe
to look at —an’ he have married Mistliress
Chookwanday; an’ home they’ll be this day
from the honeymoon, an’ stayin’ in the hotel
here till their house do be ready; an’ you
a fine, big. tall felly that can ride buckin’
horses an’ t’row bullocks over finces by
the tail! You’d have all the girls in Quart-
pot afther you if you shober up.”
“D’y think so, Denny?”
“I do that. Goondy.”
“Beg y’r pardon. Mister Deneon.”
“Granted, Misther Goondiwindi. Think
so? I know so! Women hate dhrink be-
cause they’re jealous of it, as they’re jeal-
ous of a man’s work that takes him away
from them ; or of another woman ; or jealous
of his newspaper they are if he should read
it an’ not notice them. What was it came
betune you-—you an’ your girl? Dhrink,
was it?”
“Not at first —after! First it was bul-
licks.”
“Cattle?”
“Yes. Thousands of cattle, an’ me away
drovin’ ’em.”
“Better before than afther. Thank your
shtars she found out before.”
“That was it,” replied Goondiwindi
gloomily. “That’s what come between us—-
cattle an’ pubs, bullicks an’ shieker.”
“Come you to your room, an’ they’ll call
you for your tay. Shlape you the out,
an’ then shave yourself, an’ you an’ me
will have a drink or two this night.”
“All right,” said the Bad Man. “You’ll
do me. I’ll have a rum an’ then I’ll go
an’ play shut-eye.”
“Do that,” said Denny, “an’ you’ll w*ake
like a gynte that’s had refreshmints; an’
you’ll sing like a t’rush.”
“I ain’t been a Bad Man, reely,” said the
Bad Man. “I was never in gaol in me life.”
“You were looky, then.”
“An’ I never took a man down.”
“You was fortunate, then, an’ had no
chance.”
“I’ll have a rum and then to by-bye. I’ll
go on the water-waggon after this. I’ll be
a good man.”
“T’would be a change for you,” said Denny
encouragingly. “Come you in an’ have your
rum an’ then reformation.”
* * * *
Puttifoot and the new Mrs. Puttifoot re-
turned from the honeymoon that afternoon,
and Mickey drove them to Deneen’s hotel,
which was to be their home until their house
was ready. Denny, receiving them at the
hotel entrance, saw in Puttifoot a new dig-
nity, and in the lady a new submission.
Marvelling at the change, Denny congratu-
lated Puttifoot on his improvement what
time Mrs. Puttifoot withdrew to her room
to unpack the suitcases carried in by Mickey.
“Married life have improved you, Bill
Puttifoot. You’re fatter and younger; an’,
by the hokey, your hair is growin’ on the
top of your head, an’ I can’t call you the
little wliisp of a baldy-headed butcher-man
any more wit’out tellin’ a lie.”
“Yes,” said Puttifoot. “Henny says all
me hair will come back. She’s rubbin’ on me
’ead Tunks’s Capill’ry Hair-Cofferus, night
an’ mornin’. Scratched me head once she
did be accident. But y’ can see the hair is
growin’.”
“So it is, then! Have a drink, Bill.”
“All right. But the missus don’t like me
drinkin’ in the daytime; just a nightcap
goin’ to bed we have.”
“But you have her well thrained, as I told
you, Biil. She’s as meek an’ lovin’ as a
tinder shuckin’ fowl there, ’atin’ out of your

The Bad Man from Goondiwindi awoke
when the sun was low, and the Bad Man
awoke with a scandalous taste in his mouth
and the sense of ill-being in his liver which
punishes a usually active man for afternoon
sleeping; and his stomach and liver being out
of order, he thought his discomfort was
the still, small voice of conscience becoming
as unstill and as large as if it were made for
a megaphone.
The window showed him the daylight
paling, and he read it as a personal warning
—the dwindling of the sun as the light slowly
paled out of the Bad Man’s life, and left
him there dead and worthless and forgotten.
At the terrible future visualised for himself,
the Bad Man’s eyes filled with tears. He
seemed to be marvellously friendless, and
terribly alone. He thought of the Girl at
Goondiwindi who had married the Inspector
of Nuisances at Bourke on the Darling
River, and wondered if his life would have
been better had the Girl of Goondiwindi
stayed true to him—and had they not been
separated by cattle and rum. And then his
mental processes took him further back to
the days when he was a schoolboy who never
went to school, unless he was delivered there
by the strong arm of his father. Even then,
although he had been a truant whenever
supervision was lifted, his life had been com-
paratively righteous, and from that vantage
he could look ahead again to the days when
he was a youth of 30, hating liquor and
loving horses and the open country and the
great plains—happy and free from blame.
Back again to extreme youth and his
childhood tended by a devoted mother, whom,
as a man, he had neglected ; that mother who
held the world from harming him until age
relaxed her grip on life and laid her away
in the dust of Tamworth churchyard. Ah,
if he had only known ! If knowledge did not
come to fools only when they come to the
edge of the plain that they think will open
as usual to another pleasant valley, and when
they look they look into their own graves!
To be husband to that Girl of Goondi-
windi —although she had been faithless, and
facile in selection —to have been father to
her children! If regret for all his little
sins could but restore the golden opportunity
he had missed, to his unhappiness! A little
child of his own to play on his knees; little
lingers to hold in his rough hand, a little
child to lead by that self-knowledge and con-
trol which is the discipline ot power to a
finer, fuller manhood than he had ever known !
He thought of his secret crimes, which all
men know in their hearts —the sins of omis-
sion or commission, of successful and un-
suspected theft, of treacheries never known,
of meannesses never public.
The Bad Man thought of such things as
lifting the 8.Z.1. horses, back of Brewarrina ;
of the hundreds of cleanskins lifted by him
in unfenced country, a venal sin, and one
usual to his inferiors, his betters and his
equals, and a sin of latitude and condition.
And he thought of other thefts than these,
and wished with all his soul that he had
married the Girl from Goondiwindi and that
her child called him father. He hungered
to be again a child, or, at least, to be near
a child and know his mind cleaner by the
proximity.
And then from the room next door —made
as public as a daily newspaper by the fact
that for ventilation purposes the partition
did not go all the way to the roof but
stopped on a level with the spring of the
eaves came—
“lss oo well, dear? Tell oo mummy,
darling!”
“Ess, I is.”
“Or boo’ful love! Was oo tired in oo
little tootsies?”
“Ess, I am.”
“Oo ’ickle love. Won’t oo grow up an’ be
a big mannie an’ bring home lollies an’
money for Miffnmv?”
“Ess.”
“Oo pitty love. Kiss Mummy, dear —big
nice sweetie kisses for Mummy!”
“Ess, Mummy.”
The noises of kisses inartistically timed
and placed came to the Bad Man ; his heart
yearned for that young mother and her
adored child. Yet he felt not clean enough
to overhear the sacred confidences of mother
and baby; his heart bursting with regret, his
eyes ovenvelling tears, he softly left his room
that he might not disturb the adoring mother,
and walked along the passage towards the
bar, his teeth set in resolution.
He was done with the old life. As the day
had grown dull and cold and now staggered
to its death in the dark, so should his old
life end and the new life begin—-begin in
sorrow, maybe, but, through clean living and
self-abnegation, grow to happiness. lie asked
in his inmost soul that his mother might tor-
give his neglect of her; and he; craved mercy
of God and man for many thousands of clean-
skins, and for 48 horses back of Brewarrinn,
branded 8.Z.1.: and for all the other black
and red and green and purple sins that sa<
upon fhe footrail of his bed and gibbered at
him when he was suffering the indigestion of
a recovery, lie would reform; nay, he had
reiormed in that hour; and he would make
a landmark between the howling wilderness
of his past and the quiet order of his new
life, so that all men and his own self might
know and remember. lie would ascend to
the water waggon, quailing a stirrup-cup of
soda and lirnejuice.
lie advanced to the bar window in the
hall of the hotel and said firmly, but with
an undertone of sorrow :
“Soda and lirnejuice. Jack."
“What? Soda and lirnejuiceV By eripes!
What’s the game?”
“No game,” said tin 1 Bad Man. I cut,
it out. I'm goin’ dry.”
“Can yer do it V When y’r not in the
bush, I mean.”
"My oath!” said the Bad Man, bravely
swallowing his cheerless drink of gaseous
acids, and immediately finding that he had
a wambling in the stomach. “I’m off the
hard stuff for keeps.”
lie looked at tin' rum in its decanter,
liquid rubies in the light, but held bravely
to resolution ; and, the wambling continuing,
he decided to rest again.
In his room again he lay down and all
the devils of memory came back to hurt him
and were immediately exorcised by the re-
sumed love speeches of the unknown mother
and her child.
“Ickle darling! Mummy’s love. Is oo?”
“Ess, I is.”
“Dear one. dear ickle Willie. Mummy s
boo’ful baby.”
The Bad Man’s eyes filled with tears again
as he listened to all these babyish confessions
of a child’s love and a mother’s adoration,
lie must see that child. He could not bear
not to see it.
He cautiously climbed on the high rail of
his bed-head to see the happy mother and
the little angel kidnapped from Heaven in
the sudden raid of lovers. He looked over
the partition; and there he saw a long-
nosed, grievously thin lady seated in a nig
basket-chair, and nursing upon her knee a
little, round, plump and partly-bakl butcher-
man.
“Does oo love oo Mummy, oo booful
sing?” said Mrs. Puttifoot, formerly Cho-
quindie.
“Ess, I does big-love oo,” bleated Mr.
Puttifoot.
With a yell of disgust—and of fear as
the bed-rail gave way under him—back into
the bed fell the Bad Man from Goondiwindi.
■** * *
“An’ wliat d’you yell like that for, then?"
asked Denny Doneen. “You frightened Mrs.
Ohookwanday, tliinkin’ there was murther
in the house, then.”
“I was dreamin’,” replied the Bad Man.
“An’ I woke up.... 1 thought it was a kid.
.... By Gripes, it’s no good to me. Give
me a rum.”
And from the water-waggon descended
the Bad Man from Goondiwindi.

(The ,Farallones are a group of islets 24
miles outside the Golden Gate.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rBIHERE'S a rum shin out by the Faral-
lonos
(Yo, and heave, with a corkscrew
pull) ;
She’s down —hull down—from the Golden
Gate
Where the moaning steamers creep and wait
For the hoot of the diaphones.
There’s a rum ship out by the Farallones
(Yo, and heave, with her hatches full!).
The rum boats race through the fog-banks
thick
(Port, if you hear a steamboat’s bell!).
With her bluff bows caught in the ocean
drift
Tossed and swung by the lazy lift
The rum ship feels the ocean’s kick,
The rum boats race through the fogbanks
thick
(Port your helm. Oh, port, lad, well!).
Dark is the night off the Farallones
(Yo and heave, with a corkscrew twist!) ;
And never the gleam of a white star shows —
Only the high, dim lantern glows
And the fog-horn yells and moans.
The ocean’s wide off the Farallones
(Wipe your lips where they last were
kissed !). .
Oh, who is to know that the rum boats are
(Hail the wheel if you see a sign!)
Tight as wasps round a honeycomb!
They need no lights to steer them home
Nor shadow of moon or star;
But the rum ship knows where the rum boats
are
As she swings them in on a heaving-line.
They're headed in where the waggons wait
(Hark to the hum of their driven speed!),
Into the bays where the drivers bide
And the sea rocks sing to the ebbing tide....
But the sleuths slipped out of the Golden
Gate
(Each boat call in her hour of need!).
There’s a rum ship caught off the Farallones
(Yo, and heave, how the sea tides drag!) ;
And they tell, as they steer through the
channels dark,
How she drifted in from the 32-mile mark
To the rocks Old Glory owns.
There’s a rum ship caught at the Farallones
Sailing under the British flag.
