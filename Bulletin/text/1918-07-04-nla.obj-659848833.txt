Weapons of Warfare
William Le Quex’s story of Rasputin j
most interesting where it is richest in polit
cal instruction. Hastily written from a pi
of documentary evidence and a fund of ve
bal information, the book lias no literal
merits. Nor is the spiciness of its facts
special recommendation to all the 20,000 pu
chasers of the first two Australasian edition
References to the Cult of Naked Believer
which the “Rascal Monk” introduced to th
willing ladies of I’etrograd and elsewher
grow tiresome as the book goes on. Whei
it is stated on page 14 that “lie declared tha
no woman could obtain favor of the Almight
without first committing sexual sin, becaus
that sin was the first which was forgive
above all others,” and that the wome
accepted him as the Almighty's chosen agen
for sinning purposes—when this is statec
enough has been said about Rasputin as
“holy man.”
The fellow wasn’t even a monk of an
crazy Russian sect. He invented his Cult o
Naked Believers after he had come to grie
as a horse-thief and vagabond. Gregor
Novikh by name, he acquired the title
Rasputin (meaning Ne’er-do-well-son) in th
Siberian Province of Tobolsk, where he orig
nally got himself disliked. Although he sub
sequemtly imposed upon some of the ignoran
Russian masses by means of cheap and eas
“miracles,” assisted by unquestionably hyp
notic influence, he never was more than
scandalous joke to most of the peasants wli
knew of him. Husbands and fathers of hi
high-toned society victims tried to kill him
grand-dukes kicked him out of a ballroom
But he always came up smiling owing to hi
hold on the Empress. When he was a wel
established fact in Russian autocratic go\
ernment the Kaiser worked him for all h
was worth as a traitorous scoundrel, and a
sole controller of the royal personage wli
wanted Germany to win the War.
Rasputin’s principal official colleagues
the betrayal of his wretched country wer
Stiirmer, whom he had pushed into the posi
tion of Premier, and Protopopoff. One of hi
secret letters of instruction from Berlin
said:—
You arc to inform S. and P. that the shortage o
food in Russia is not sufficiently marked. They mus
appoint a new food-controller who will contrive to ereat
a famine. An epidemic, if spread in Moscow, Kazan
Kharkow, Odessa and other cities at the same tim
as the famine, would greatly contribute towards Ger
many’s success. The matter has been discussed ant
an outbreak of cholera suggested.
A deciphered letter which came to him when
ho was living under an alias in Berlin (in
1916) was from Protopopoff:—
S. is eager for news regarding the proposed German
offensive against the British in Flanders, and the
exact position regarding the U-boat campaign. In-
form the Chancellor that news from Washington
to-day shows that President Wilson is determined
ana warn him that J. and G., whom he will knov
by initials as German agents in the United States
have been discovered and may be arrested. He may
perhaps communicate with them bv wireless....
Present my humble compliments to his Majesty the
Emperor.
Rasputin visited Berlin under the alias of
Pastor Yan Meewen, with a trusty man
servant for his companion. (The trusty
man-servant gave a lot of facts away aftei
his unreverend master had been happily mur
dered.) But it seems that the German press
didn’t make any mystery of the intrigues
with Russian traitors, for Rasputin was no
sooner back at Petrograd than the Kol-
nxsche Zeitung said: “We need have no
fear. Stiirmer may be relied on not to place
any obstacles in the way of Russia’s desire
for peace with Germany.”
Meantime Rasputin had despatched
wireless message from a Russian warship ii
the Baltic to the Admiralty station a't Reva:
—a message in a cipher of which the key
was discovered after the Revolution:—
To his Excellency the Minister Protopopoff.—All
goes well. I had an audience at the Neues Palais
H?; d u y , of , three hour3 ’ duration. Inform Charles
Michael that the Emperor sends his best greetingi
and acknowledgments of his despatch of the 3rd
inst.. It has been found necessary to recall the
troops who have been held ready at Hamburg and
Bremen for the invasion of Britain. The General
htaff have, after due consideration, decided that an
invasion might meet with disaster, henee they are
turning their attention to submarine and aerial
attacks upon Britain in order to crush her. I have
learnt from a conversation with the Kaiser that
bond on is to be destroyed by a succession of fleets
of super-aeroplanes launching newly-devised explosive
and poison-gas bombs of a terribly destructive char-
acter.
While all this was happening the- German-
ised Premier of Russia and his co-conspirator
Protopopoff were busy pulling the leg of
Britain and her Allies, and poor General
-Hrussiloff was honestly protesting to an
American interviewer that the ultimate
defeat of Germany admitted of no doubt
whatever. William le Quex’s evidence is
most important not for its revelations of a
dirty hypnotist debauching mob of idle,
historical women, but for its testimony that
Intrigue is Germany’s most deadly weapon.
Is treacherv being associated with official
piotestations of patriotism in any other of
the allied countries?” asks the romantic his-
torian who has turned dead-and-damned
Rasputin to such excellent business account.
The Guardians of the Gate
a flew b°ok of historical lectures on
the herbs, The Guardians of the Gate (Ox-
ford: Clarendon Press), R. G. D. Laffan
takes a different view about Johnny Turk:
There has been and fs now a tendency in Emr-
land to regard the Turks as a race of honorable
gentlemen, clean fighters, and even, when left to
themselves, very tolerable governors. The nations whom
they have ruled have thought very differently. They
know what it has meant to be defenceless before the
Sfi ® tkew sons carried off to be educated as
Moslems and to form the corps of Janizaries, to be
unable to protect their daughters from entering the
harems of the dominant race, or the fruits of their
labor from the landlords... .To his equal in wealth
or military prowess the Turk has usually appeared
filh<L g ri leman i Ti th th , e qualities of'a gallant
lighter but woe to those whom Allah has made weak
and delivered into his hand, should they not submit
to all Ills wishes 1
Baffan notes tnat a main influence in pre*
serving the national spirit of Servia has
been the folk songs and ballads (pesme).
V Ke old British ballads, these produc-
tions of nameless bards were handed on from
generation to generation without being put

Sleep-Meter comes
from overseas to over-
see your time. He
was born in the home
of Big Ben.
Sleep-Meter is de-
signed to measure sleep
as a good alarm should;
and to tick off your work-
a-day minutes in a steady,
truthful way.
The same good Westclox con-
struction that helped Big Ben
success makes Sleep-Meter run
and ring on time. Needle-line
pivots of polished steel greatly
reduce friction. That’s the
Westclox method of clock mak-
ing. And that’s why folks call
Westclox success clocks.
Sleep-Meter is five inches
high, has a clear, readable dial,
clean cut hands, a pleasant-toned
back-bell, and a sturdy build.

your body must be kept to concert pitch. Your mind cannot be
alert and vigorous if your body is slack, listless and enervated.
Every day, as regularly as you wind up your watch, you
must wind up your system, in order that, purified

I’ve taken a ship to the foot of the hill
Where Sunset is driving young Evening to
rest
Through pastures of stars to the shadowy
West.
Down under, deep under, I see the waves
whirl.
From amber and jade to a kingdom of
pearl;
The haven of Happiness there in the sea.
Hy-Brasil! Hy-Brasil! that beckons to me!

French Roses.
My brother wrote to me from fair, sad
France.
From muddy trenches close to Dead Man's
Hill.
No word he said of Huns, or each hour s
chance
Of life or death; or how he hungered still
For baths and comforts missed in ravished
France.
Nothing of nerves, or lost loved streets, or
pain;
No word of empty places at the Mess,
Nor of impatience at the pelting rain,
Or at the killing work, the strain, and
stress;
No mention of his pain in others’ pain.
Only that he and all the boys were well,
And that his job was really rather good
As jobs went now —silly to call it He 11....
Sorry to hear of London short of food
Sent greetings, and hoped everyone was well.
But in a postcript over-leaf he said
That he had seen some roses growing there
Three paces out in No Man’s Land; tin-
dead
And dying always seemed to turn and stare
At these white roses at the last, he said.
All through the day the shells had fallen
near;
Deep craters in the field had opened wide ;
But ever that lost garden-strip was clear
For dying eyes to see; the loud, red tide
Rolled back whenever burning Death crepr
near.
And in the next day’s dawn he saw the tree
Still there ; no rose had fallen in the night.
A shred of garden where white roses three
In No Mam’s Land bloomed sweet and
bright,
Like fragrant prayers upon an older Tree —
White roses three or three lamps rapt and
still
That light red day and night, out there
in France.
For fading eyes that peer down Dead Man’s
Hill,
And leave at last to God the soldier's
chance.
God send His roses dawn-white bloom there
still!

HILARY LOFTING.
Knights and Ladies.
I picture through the years
A beach that clasps a sea
Whose spray is as the salt of tears,
Each wave a memory.
Here fell that whispered word
My heart may not forget;
So low you spoke, I scarcely heard:
“Dear! Knights and ladies yet!”
For loneliness in lieu
Of all I did not take,
For all the gracious rift of you
Rejected for your sake,
No thanks are in my heart,
Nor would you have them be.
Whose lips, that joined us, kept apart
That paradise and me.
Our footprints on the sand
Ere dawn were swept away;
Our path from that forbidden land
No sunlight might betray.
Though neither cross nor mound
Death’s presence may declare*
To you, to me, ’tis holy ground—•
Our love lies buried there.

A MATTER FOR CONSIDERATION.
If Acting-Prime Minister Watt is in a hurry
to do the best he can to make the world safe
for democracy lie will retire t,o a lonely place
and think hard over the War Precautions
Act. Having done this it may strike him
that the time is about ripe to use the danger-
ous instrument aforesaid with more cir-
cumspection than has been shown hitherto.
Apart from considerations of how much
“freedom of speech” a citizen is entitled to
expect while a war is raging round the cor-
ner, and about the point at which non-con-
formity merges into treason, the War Pre-
cautions Act is liable to do much more harm
than good unless it is used with great care.
It is all very well to say that it is possible
through this Aot to get hold of individuals
w r ho would otherwise talk treason at the top
of their voices; that at a time of national
peril it would be as idiotic to let treason-
mongers have a free tongue as to split legal
hairs about the interpretation of plain words.
There is a comprehensive truth in this. But
it is also true that under the War Precau-
tions Act the definition of treason or some-
thing akin thereto, can be made so elastic as
to wear an appearance provocative of de-
rision. It is of far less importance to Aus-
tralia that the Federal Government should
do nothing to make the populace hostile to
recruiting than that it should exasperate
it by fussy officiousness. If Watt has an
idea that there has been no exasperation
concerning an incident which, unfortunately,
The Bulletin is not allowed to directly re-
fer to, he should get it out of his head right
away. There has been any amount of exas-
peration. Nor has it been without reason.
The net result of it all has been to
turn too many men into surreptitious
workers against enlistment, with a balance
Oil the other hand of shutting the mouths of
» few Windy feather-heads whose influence
V«d they been left alone would have amounted
to less than that of a pickled onion.
About the facts leading up to recent
arrests The Bulletin has no knowledge;
but taking the case as it has been
stated for the Government it seems
fairly clear that the ordinary processes of
law are ample to deal with the alleged
offence. This country is not under martial
law, and Watt should see that nobody has
justification for saying that it is next door to
it. The adage about allowing enough rope to
be accumulated for purposes of suicide is
one that officialdom always forgets, and
the politician is ever prone to think
that exhibitions of force are mistaken
for indications of strength. After all would
it matter if all the alleged seditionists and
“friends of the enemy” and opponents of
reinforcing the army and assorted freaks in
general were allowed to come out in the open
and be seen and heard and be judged by the
ordinary law? For a long time the War
Precautions Act has been an obstacle to re-
cruiting. The Acting Prime Minister ought
to reconsider the position. There are many
reasons why he should, and not a single
reason why he shouldn’t.
OUR BLOATED ARISTOCRACY OF
AMBASSADORS.
The chronic disease of job hunger is just
now in a virulent phase. Almost every week
it is discovered by persons in the running
for adipose billets that there is an adipose
billet unfilled, and that Australia is suffering
great loss because somebody hasn’t been
appointed long since with a big salary and
heavy allowances and a considerable staff and
a long engagement and no supervision save
his own. to sit in marble halls somewhere
with a one-ton carpet on the floor, and advise
or revise or supervise. The discovery of the
want is never made by the rank-and-file of
the community. The farmer, the meat- and
wool-grower, the mining man or the manu-
facturer doesn't clamor that some second-
rate city lawyer or moderately successful
middleman or troublesome politician should
be sent abroad at vast expense to explain all
about goods he doesn’t understand to people
who have no faith in his judgment and who
have no time for him. They flatly refuse to
hire him as a commercial-traveller on his
merits; possibly they wouldn’t hire him as a
junior clerk. Also, they sometimes foam at
the mouth when they hear how the mentally-
shambling person has described their goods.
Cook and Hughes have suddenly
discovered that Australia suffers great loss
for lack of a highly-paid representative at
Washington. The nature of the loss isn’t
specified. We can’t sell manufactured
goqds to the United States, for, by reason of
too much Freetrade and too many borrowing
habits and the easy lingering habits born of
the borrowing habits, we haven’t a surplus
in any single line to sell. We even import
tacks, and W. M. Hughes at Wash-
ington could hardly get us tacks any cheaper
than our own buyers do. Besides, tacks
aren’t made at Washington. We sell wool
to the U.S. at the world’s price. In 1916 it
took nearly £8.000,000 worth of our wool, or
about one-third, against an abject £500,000
worth in 1911; but the U.S. buyers
came here, and Hughes at Washington
wouldn’t be of any use. Anyhow, the
wool doesn’t go to Washington. We send
coal to the U.S. Pacific Coast when we Can
get ships to carry it, but the Pacific Coast is
a long, long way from Washington, and
hurried business-men make their-deals by
cable. As for having a highly-paid function-
ary to help us buy from the U.S., we already
buy far more than we can honestly pay for.
And this country doesn’t want a borrower
over there. It already owes too much, and
if anybody from China or Peru feels like
buying our securities, there are drayloads of
them in London ready to be peddled out to
all the world. Even a capitalist on the
upper waters of the Amazon can get £lOO,OOO
worth of them any day if the cable holds out..
Why a gilded jack-of-all-trades should be
required in Washington passes understand-
ing.
In London this suffering Commonwealth
already pays seven borrowing ambassadors,
to say nothing of special officers who look
after immigrants, commerce and side-lines.
The job-hungerers now suggest a special
Australian War Minister in London. He can’t
make our men fight any better, for no men
ever born could fight better. He can’t pay
them, for he will have no more money than
any other official. His influence on recruit-
ing will be nil, he being too far away. His
advice about military and naval operations
and the making of ships and munitions won’t
be valuable, and his counsel about the dis-
posal of things at the close of the war seems
superfluous while there is a High Commis-
sioner about. Furthermore, there has arisen
a scheme at the mouth of Agent-General
Wade, of N. S. Wales, for a Dominions
Office in place of a Colonial Office, the same
to be staffed by men “who have served their
apprenticeship overseas and have studied the
operation of liberal institutions and under-
stand the workings of democratic minds.”
There are exactly 90 men in the Assembly
which Wade used to adorn who would fill
the bill to their own satisfaction. Their
disagreement about democratic institutions
is marvellous, but they have a general idea
that the best democrat is the one who pawns
the soul of posterity most heavily to foreign
capitalists and supplies most holidays. A
very common feeling has been that the less
Imperial interference there is in Australian
affairs, the better we are pleased, and that
it would be poor policy to prod the
“Colonial” Office into fresh activity in our
direction by filling it with officials who, until
they became stale and out of date, would
know in quite a number of different ways
how this country should be governed, and
how other Dominions should be governed, and
how other Dominions think we should be
governed. The “Colonial” Office is a quiet
affair which interferes hardly at all with self-
governing Dominions unless, like Cape
Colony and Natal in the old days, their poli-
tics were necessarily mixed up with the
foreign affairs of Huns. Boers, Zulus and
Portuguese on their borders. Its chief busi-
ness is to look after nigger and mixed depend-
encies which haven’t reached, and perhaps
never will reach, the Parliamentary stage,
and to which the impassioned knowledge of
the borrowing and road-and-bridge politician
re payment of members, trades-unionism and
one-adult-one-vote would be disastrous and
confusing. It lives really to oil the wheels
of niggerdom. and it does this pretty well on
£60.000 a year for “salaries, etc.,” so far
as we can see at a distance. With all
its multifarious labors spread over Asia,
Africa, America and all the oceans, it lias
only six officials whose salaries compare with
those of N. S. Wales’s three Civil Service
Commissioners. Charles Wade reckons
that if the job-hungerers crowd into this
place and treble the expense they will
“breathe on the dry bones of officialdom.”
Breathing on bones is dirty. Breathing on
bones which don’t concern us is imper-
tinence.
With all its ambassadors, and its pro-
posed ambassadors, and its temporary or
flying commissioners like N ielsen and
Senator Long, and its permanent com-
missioners. and its proposed commis-
sioners, and the ardent paid reformers
whom Wade wants to barnacle on to the
“Colonial” Office, and its suggested War
Minister in London, this country looks as if
its principal export would one day be diplo-
matists. And the ‘output of local jobs on
Boards and Commissions is terrible. Some
of these jobs are made for respected gentle-
men in high places because the men behind
them And promotion slow. Many are made
for disrespected but very influential gentle-
men whom their colleagues can’t endure any
longer. Under the plain, sensible system of
elected Ministers the potent but intolerable
one can be shifted by a vote of the House
(including probably his colleagues) without
sacrificing' the rest of the Ministry and put-
ting the Onnosition in power. Under the
party system a discredited leader can
seldom be bounced unless the whole Cabinet
goes with him. and the rest of the Cabinet
objects to going. So the nasty man on top
is paid at the nublic cost to cease from
troubling; that is to say, a rich billet is
found or made for him. No politician save
an honest one desires to have the party sys-
tem interfered with, for every one sees ahead
of him the golden hope of becoming so huge,
or at. least disagreeable, that he must be
bribed to leave off. It is all mean
and expensive. It costs more than a
full-blown peerage, for a peer isn’t salaried
for being a peer. He has to hustle for his
crust the same as a laborer or a slum land-
lord. N. (S. Wales nays its Agent-Ceneral,
who is a mere deputy of the High Commis-
sioner. far more than Chile, a prosperous
Republic with the same acreage and nearly
twice the population, pays to its President.
It pays Wade’s secretary, the shadow of a
shadow, more than the wage of the President
of Switzerland. A certain wandering and
humorous and undistinguished Commissioner
who went to the U.S. and whose output of
information was small, was earning for a
long while at the same rate as the U.S.
Minister for War, for his “allowance” was
liberal and his Parliamentary wage went on
in his absence. X. S. Wales, in its usual
capacity of Ma State, leads the way in job-
hunger, as in many other bumptious evils.
Hughes and Cook' and Wade who are head-
ing the new crusade for foreign billets are all
N.S.W. politicians.. And seeing that N.S.W.
has the biggest debt in the Common-
wealth, and is floating the biggest loans, and
provides the loudest wail to the effect that it
can't earn its own bread and cheese and will
starve if the loans stop, its position is
anomalous. In fact, the whole position is
anomalous.
AT NECROPOLIS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down at Stradbroke Island, a sombre
jewel set in Moreton Bay, there is a settle-
ment of 1871 men and women who have
given up battling, and through that quiet
haven drift slowly to the sand. It is a good,
kindly thing the State does there, and the
inhabitants have all the happiness life has
left for them. Westward is Peel Island, the
home of lepers; a lazar house that lights
disease and sometimes cures it. So, here in
this bay, science is coddling the dying and
salving the leper, while it hacks to pieces
the youth, health, courage and beauty of the
world on the battlefields of Europe, and
breaks splendid life upon the wheel. And to
add to that enormity, while strong men who,
in the ordinary course of nature, would be
the fathers of the future, are killed, old
habits and prejudices that regard war as
natural also regard as natural the apathy of
the State in permitting the spread and per-
petuation of syphilis and tuberculosis, even
to the extent of regarding State examination
of men and women projecting marriage aS
an interference with “the liberty of the sub-
ject.” But unless as a people we are pre-
pared to die out, and die out in unspeakable
horrors, every citizen must # regard himself
and his body as the property of the State,
and the State must deal with him in the
interests of public safety.
These thoughts of the betterment of life
arise from the consideration of death, and of
the two cities of the dead, one on the island
by Moreton Bay, the other on the footlnlls
of Toowong. At Dunwich there are 250
deaths a year from an average population of
.1000 or so. There are acres of dead
closely packed—about a foot between the
graves; all safely pigeonholed for refer-
ence below the grass. There are hun-
dreds of little iron crosses for identi-
fication, each but a few inches above its
skeleton and the grass covering it; a few
tombstones staggering to the dissolution of
the people they record ; poincianas spreading
greenly above, and 14 graves open and
ready. There is a blind Cingalese: he
has been here for 27 years making his daily
round of the cemetery guided by his tapping
stick, and a close attendant of all burials.
Of the 1371 people of Dunwich 932 were
born in the United Kingdom, and 215 in
Australia and Maoriland. The proportion
of inmates is greatest between the ages of
70 and 80 (421) ; but there are 176 between
80 and 90; and 14 alleged to be 90 and over,
although most of these ages, relying on im-
perfect memories or the tendency to exag-
gerate age, are as uninviting to verification
as they are probably impossible of it. The
loudest noise of this Necropolis is the sea
upon the, shingle and the tapping of the
blind man’s stick.
Toowong cemetery I have seen in the
good, hot summer and the genial autumn : in
the time of the frangipanni in its first
season of bloom; of the jasmine and
magnolia and . all the heavy scents which
are to many people the smell of death, and
are to me the essence of life—to me the
flower of the bride, as to most people the
flower of the dead. I saw it again in
the late autumn. The poinsettia flaming
already; the salvia and hibiscus blazing; the
wattles beginning to make air heavy
with scents of the new season; and air all
blue and gold going up- the foothills to the
wooded heights that rampart this other
Necropolis. It is the most Italian of Aus-
tralian cemeteries; serried ranks and tiers
and terraces of monuments and single
shafts; an acropolis of tombs; monoliths
making these rolling hills aspirant; stone
needles and broken columns, and draped
and extinguishing torches; and never enough
of the cypress that is sword, flame and
feather all in one.
It is white stone and scent and silence in
these hills, once you pass the bamboo groves
that creak and whisper ceaselessly of strain-
ing cordage on the sea. The ostrich plumes
of the poineiana throw moving shadows over
balustraded tombs; a frangipanni has cap-
tured and over-shadowed a grave and its
monolith ; and the white streets of necropolis
descending to the valley flow up the
hill beyond. Legislator and lawyer are
memoria lised in this highest hill; Governors
Blackall and Maurice O’Connell ;
Knights Charles Lilley. Arthur Palmer
and Joshua Peter Bell; Judge Mein and
Robert Ranking, first Police Magistrate of
Queensland; and farther on, many men 1
knew — W. 11. Browne, B. D. Morehead,
MacDonald Patterson, Jack An near
and James Tiiallon. Good George Paul,
Judge and steadfast friend, who should have
died hereafter, is somewhere here; and
Claude Lewis Bernays, whom I knew at
Gavutu and who was killed in the Solomons
at the age of 25. Peter Jackson is in
another section, and on the Western Hill is
T. J. Byrnes, the State Premier who died
young; all Brisbane at their feet and, east-
ward, blue hills beyond the river.
All the life about these who once were as
good or as bad as any of us is the life of
the flowers and of the little lizards who run
over the tombs and. make a lizard’s palace
of a crack in the mausoleum of the once-
great. In rare places there is no hiding
place for a lizard —only a blanket of green
lawn, and the unconsciously pure art of the
little cross of marble laid upon the grass,
and bearing but a word.
Let us draw the thankful breath that we
be still alive; death being a horror not to
be thought on till it be here, and then calmly
accepted. It is more the duty of man to
think of life and the bettering of it. The
worship of the dead and of death is a wrong
thing; dead men. dead things, dead beliefs,
dead kings, dead shibboleths and dead lies-
which once were almost facts. These tombs
in Toowong of Sergeant Bruce, killed in the
Boer War;, and Driver Anderson, killed in
France; and of the three brothers Cordell.
also killed in France; are of more value to
the present than all of Queen Elizabeth
and her gladiators, because they are nearer.
The fact that these men did “so die is yet
another and quicker reason why the democ-
racies of the world, once in power, make
wars of aggression impossible, as present re-
publics have made them difficult.

MADNESS WITH METHOD AND
MADNESS WITHOUT METHOD.
The person with a patent medicine for sale
is always with ns, and his nostrum in its
most aggressive form is warranted to cure
poverty, shell-shock, religious despondency,
horrors and dandruff. The discoverer of
perpetual motion is generally around with-
out the faintest idea that his great device
has been discovered unsuccessfully thousands
of times already. And in times of stress,
especially in countries like Australia, where
politics of one sort or another are among
the biggest of the great natural industries,
the political perpetual-motion genius and
patent-medicine vendor is very numerous. He
includes the mere talking-machine, the semi-
lunatic with the craze of persecution; the
person w r ith a mania for power, even if it is
only the power to sway a small audience by
vague denunciation at a street corner; the
honest but unfledged individual who hears
for the first time about some battered finan-
cial device which is as old as the valleys, but
which he regards as a precious find because
he is so far behind the intellectual procession
that he didn’t hear of it earlier; the person
with a sour stomach whose bile leads to
general hatred; the criminal who believes
that general smash is worth while for the
sake of the excitement and the possible pick-
ings among the debris; and the professional
traitor who serves the enemy. The last-
named at least knows w r here he is tending,
and having a steady purpose in view he can
use the feckless, shiftless folk for many
purposes. Strikes about anything or
nothing are among his great weapons.
They leave' hatred and poverty behind them,
and poverty breeds more hatred. A large,
long, bitter strike ending in utter failure is
an asset, for it makes more people poor and
aggravated than a successful upheaval. There
is quite a large, or at least a loud, demand
that Australia should withdraw from the
war, so that the Hun, whom all the discon-
tented seem to love, may have a better chance
of winning and settling his own terms with
this country afterwards. Proposals for com-
pelling all institutions to hand their reserves
to the Commonwealth Bank are seriously
advanced before a Labor Conference; there-
are fierce demands for a levy of some
sort on bank deposits, with no mention
of the obvious fact that deposits are
'the money an institution owes, not the
money it has. Annexing bank deposits
sounds large and thrilling, but it is only
stealing debts. Mixed theories are abroad
that the Governments should raise a lot
more loans at interest or without interest
and make more debt, and this is muddled
with propositions for the repudiation of the
debt. The Commonwealth Bank, which is
the property of the people, and one of
the world’s finest examples of successful
co-operation, comes in for much contumely,
and its reorganisation is often demanded
so that the Bank may cease to be an


engine of class tyranny. There is a lot
of shapeless verbal discontent in these days
of casual red-flagging, and it all looks too in-
coherent to have any purpose. But every kind
of annoyed person, or individual who can be
taught to become annoyed, is cultivated by
tljie Bolshevik element and urged to rise
against parties unknoAvn and do “direct
actions” not clearly specified. If enough
people can be persuaded that they ought to
be sufficiently annoyed a general disintegra-
tion sets in. Russia representated the great
success of this. The upheaval was a care-
fully engineered combination of many griev-
ances. Probably the most astonished folk
of all were a lot of Avell-meaning persons
who thought they Avere leading the movement
and found that they were oniy following it,
and following so far behind that they Avere
presently left hull-down on the horizon.
They imagined themselves to be Generals,
and they weren’t even the hangers-on at the
last baggage-waggon.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gun Under the Bed.
To democratise the Defence Act it should include:
An appeal from courts-martial to the civil courts;
officers elected from qualified men by the subordinate
ranks: officers to have served in the ranks ; optional
salute'; officers and men to mess together; trainees
and citizen forces to have the custody of their arms j
age of compulsory training to be raised to 18 years
with provision for conscientious objectors. -Scheme
laid before the Australian Labor Conference.
The proposals that nobody should be
eligible to be an officer unless he had
first been a ranker, that all officers should
be elected by the rank-and-file, and that
officers and men should mess together, have
points in their favor and they have other
points. There would be a tendency for Bill
in the aggregate to elect Bill in the con-
crete to be an officer on the strength of his
personal popularity, his scientific ability,
which he had had no chance to demonstrate,
being decided upon by his mates, who. in many
cases, had no more scientific knowledge than
himself. True, the choice is to be made from
“qualified’’ men, but probably in the long
run Bill in t]ie aggregate would decide who
Avere the qualified men. The policy of the
election of officers is always supported by
the example of the French revolutionary
army, but the parallel is doubtful. The Com-
mittee of Public Safety, the Convention or the
Directory made short work of the elected
officer if he didn’t give satisfaction, and it
was the judge of ivhat was satisfaction.
Potentates like Robespierre. St. Just,
Carnot and Bonaparte ran the show with
a high hand. The election idea would prove
admirable provided there was some capable
authority to decide on the qualifications of
candidates; but otherwise the tests would be
plausibility and jolly-good-fellowship. The
idea of officers and men eating together is
evidently meant to prevent the officer getting
too high an opinion of himself. It is appar-
ently intended to avert real authority; to
remind the captain or the colonel that he is
only Bill after all; to make sure that he
remains Bill, and to give all hands a chance
to call him so three times a day.. He and
his class aren’t to retire into seclusion like a
caucus or a conference, which also consists
of elected men. It is the same principle
which causes the editor of a Labor paper to
lunch with the humblest members of the
staff, and leads eyen the very wealthy Labor
member like McGirb (N.S.W.) to take his
meals along with the domestic servants and
the handy man. The idea of making all sen-
tences by court-martial subject to review by
the civil courts can be approved on the score
of theoretical justice, but it will make any
kind of discipline so slow as to be almost
non-existent. And the private should surely
be able to put some trust in the findings of
a military court composed of men taken
from his own order, elected by himself, and
liable, three times a day, to get the tough
bits' of the meat and find the mustard put
out of their reach if they don’t give satisfac-
tion. Then in the ordinary course of events
there is an appeal to a high commanding-
officer who would also be liable to hear the
candid opinion of his subordinates at each
meal. The idea looks like the expression of
a firm resolve to keep the officer very ’umble
—perhaps too ’umble to be useful. The
optional salute can be defended on the
ground that it is optional to take off one’s
hat to a lady ; in fact, the salute is a useless
frill. After all, the most important proposi-
tion is that trainees should have the custody
of their own weapons. Why there should
be such a wholesale demand for weapons in
the house during time of peace unless some-
body is planning an organised insurrection
with bloodshed and adjuncts it is hard to
say. The placing of guns and ammunition
at the complete disposal of I.W.W. men,
Bolsheviks, Anarchists, Hun agents, men
who advocate “Direct Action” (which can
only mean Direct Violence), and any other
persons who care to qualify for the posses-
sion of lethal weapons by starting military
training seems reckless. It is a pity that the
public and the press were shut out when
members of the Labor Conference were toll -
ing each other why they wanted to arm their
followers at the public expense—not merely
to arm them when on military duty, but to
equip them for an organised midnight rising
against the great, unorganised majority which
could mostly be disarmed before morning.
It is the public that is liable to be shot at
with its own gun, and the. crowd which meets
behind closed doors doesn’t inspire unlimited
confidence.
The National Wardrobe.
Ax importer submitted to the Inter-State
Commission at Melbourne last week the
opinion that whether imported material
would be used as frequently to clothe Aus-
tralians after the war as before depended on
“public taste and price.” Well, with a
view to educating the national palate The
Bulletin puts it to William lliggs that
he should negotiate for peace with Watt
and Pearce., . so that a comprehensive
measure anticipating the development, of
good taste in clobber may be passed during
the armistice. The measure might reason-
ably include the following provisions:—
1. That hereinafter any person under the age of
92 years (in Bananaland 91, on account of the Awful
Climate) who appears in a public place wearing
imported woollen clothes or colorable imitation, for
any of the purposes hereby enumerated, shall be sub-
ject to summary arrest and internment for 11 years
or until the termination of the war, whichever is
the longest, that is to say—
Appears in public to attend a funeral; buys or
sells war bonds, wheat scrip, sausages or any
other ponderable or describable thing whatso-
ever ; visits the theatre, pictures or races ; attends
a meeting of his union, club or political party;
drinks tea; loafs or works.
2. That if any individual of either sex is detected
in the vicinity of a hospital, railway station, court
of law, shop, house or motor-car clad in apparel
on which the place of origin is not branded in letters
11 inches long, such brand to be immediately under
the top hem of the outer garment, such individual
shall be subject to conviction before a J.P. and liable
to a fine of £75 per annum for six years.
3. That on a date to be fixed by Order-in-Council
but not later than three months after the pass-
ing of this Act, coats, pants, waistcoats, overcoats,
mantles, skirts, jackets and costumes of all descrip-
tions made from materials not wholly manufactured
in Australia shall be surrendered to the police and
forwarded to Russia at the earliest opportunity fo#
distribution among the Bolsheviks. Any person who
retains such articles to be also forwarded to Russia.
4. Should the supply of locally-manufactured
materials not be adequate to meet the demand, the
Ministry is hereby empowered to place the popula-
tion on a clothes ration, consisting of not more
than one suit and an extra pair of pants for males
and one dress for females, renewals to be permitted
every year during the currency of the war. Any
male found on inspection to be harboring more than
one suit and an extra pair of pants shall be deprived
of the trousers ration, and any female hoarding or
borrowing or otherwise trafficking in the regulation or
other drapery may be made co-respondent in any
divorce proceedings then pending, at the option of
the petitioner, without right of being heard at the
proceedings.
Unless an early start is made somewhere to
develop the national taste there is a strong
probability that before the war collapses
many Australians will have to fall back on
cornsacks and rabbit-skins, or take to the
bush to escape the consequences.
The Tariff Menace.
There is much food for thought in the N. S.
Wales Agent-General’s account of the con-
dition of labor in British-owned fac-
tories in China. Good Australians, who
hope to see the Commonwealth enter
upon a new phase of existence after
the war, and become a self-supporting
and self-supplying nation, have reason to
foresee much trouble in the fact that Eng-
lish capitalists are employing children for 12
hours a day for seven days a week, and 52
weeks in the year, in a land where flesh and
blood are. cheap and factory laws non-exis-
tent. While the masses of Britain and the
Donfinions are fighting for the existence of
the Empire, filled with the hope of a new
world to be and better conditions after the
struggle is over, Fat is preparing to build
up huge dividends for himself by a plan
which is capable of wrecking any chance of
a satisfactory industrial future unless he is
firmly discouraged. What good is it for
British and Australian politicians to blather
about the paradise for the workers that we
must all help to establish after the Hun is
defeated, when wealthy British manufac-
turers are contemplating the swamping of
the home industries with dirt cheap goods
manufactured under as dreadful a system of
slavery as the world has even known? How
long are we to regard as patriotic citizens
men who for their own greedy ends compel
their fellow citizens to compete against
sweated Chow kids? If countries with
hopes of better things for the producing
masses are going to allow goods manu-
factured in such conditions to enter
their markets, good wages and conditions must
go under. Yet Acting Prime-Minister Watt
declares that there is no intention of build-
ing up the tariff defence. It is time that
Australian democrats left off quarrelling
about petty party politics, and looked this
menace in the face.
Liberty v. License.
“O.Iv.” : Thebe was a weird gathering at
Melbourne Towm Hall one night last week
for the purpose of setting up a “League of
Liberty” on a platform of vague negatives.
The alleged object was to “safeguard the
reasonable and necessary freedom of action
of the individual of the community,” but
never a speaker attempted to define “reason-
ableness” and “necessity” as regards what
the individual should be allowed to do.
Nothing, in fact, was made clear by the
utterances of the Leaguers, except that, they
could depend on the warm support of brewers,
distillers, pub-keepers, etc. The repeal
of “extreme” legislation was demanded,
but the definition of “extreme” remained un-
stated ; yet it seems certain that “liberty”
meant extension of existing “license,” with
particular regard to liquor traffic and pony
meetings. The note practically sounded by
the Leaguers was a note of interrogation—
how much liberty or license is reasonable
and necessary to the average individual, not
forgetting the citizen in short skirts and tall
boots? Certainly Billson, M.L.A., ventured
to remark that “Indulgence in sport and love
of gaiety in the past had not been inimical
to the moral health of the community.” but
even he forbore from stating exactly what he
was driving at. Nobody, anyhow openly,
advocated more liberty for the fair sex. Posi-
tives were avoided. Whilst liberty was hav-
ing its night out in the Town Hall, a rival
meeting at the Temperance Hall resolved: —
That this meeting is of opinion that the greatest
hindrance to national and personal liberty is the
legalised liquor traffic, and that the liberty of the
individual can best be obtained through the total
prohibition of alcoholic drinks.
When you come to think of the number of
people who lose their liberty as the result of
drink or pony-racing, or both, the argument
seems to be in favor of the “extremists.”
They, at any rate, are game to state exactly
what they want or what they don't want.
Time was when the suppression of cock-
fighting. bull bear-baiting and all-night-
gambling houses was challenged as an inter-
ference with the liberty of the subject.. The
outcry against “cant” and “hypocrisy” had
just as much show of force in the 18th cen-
tury as it has to-day, but “cant” and “hypoc-
risy” survived the outcry when the brutality
of cock-fighting was wiped out and corporal
punishment in the army and navy was abol-
ished by men who had been taught in
their youth that liberty to order a flogging
was necessary to a commanding-officer.
Though the extremist didn’t actually win, his
battle was generally drawn in his favor.
«
If the Kaiser Had Grown Cabbages.
“Henry Horsecollar” in reply
The holding-forth of “George Street” (B.
20/6/’18) with the above heading leaves me cold and
unconvinced. I think that eloquent writer is rather
uneven, is overcrowded in places, and that his argu-
ment is out of repair. Also his alignment strikes
me as imperfect, and he drives his theory on the
wrong side of the highway.
I have a fixed belief that the population of the
world is rapidly overtaking the possible food
supply.
“Georoe Street” holds that there is no visible
risk of over-population, and throws road metal or
kerbstones at Statistician Knibbs’s supposition about
the human race doubling itself in 60 years. If it
did he believes that “small, healthy island popula-
tions which have been little affected by disease and
not at all by war should during the centuries have
so increased that there would hardly have been
standing-room for a blade of grass between their
boots, but a' very slight emigration to larger lands
has maintained the freedom of the garden patch.”
Without any desire to obstruct the traffic I can’t
locate the island which “George Street” describes
unless it is Pitcairn, a speck of recent settlement
whereof the previous history is mislaid, or some
baby atoll in the farther-out Pacific. The Hawaiian
group has been struck by everything from the
Emperor Kamehameha to measles, yet it looks fairly
off the track. Greenland, which seems pretty safe,
has had pestilence and war —war to a finish, and
none of the defeated party left to tell what hap-
pened. They just were, and they just were not.
Iceland has had plagues and revolution. There have
been pestilences and gory strife on the Isle of Dogs,
and Pinchgut hasn’t been free from recrimination.
- But the main point is that the tall old skyscraping
centuries to which “George Street” refers have
nothing to do with the case. The great art of
multiplying population is a one-storev affair. It
began one century ago. In all the sons from the
great fish lizard to 1811, England and Wales accumu-
lated 10,000,000 inhabitants. In 1911, despite the
vast export of people to the United States, Canada,
South Africa, Australia, Maoriland and elsewhere,
the number was 36,000,000. Allowing for emigration
the nation suddenly took to doubling about every
20 years. The increase between 1570 and 1750
(180 ill-drained and badly-ventilated years) was
just about half that between 1901 and 1911 (io
comparatively well-drained years with fewer germs
in them). And England is rather behind the proces-
sion than in front of it. The United States,
Canada, the Argentine Republic, Australia, Maori-
land, Cape Colony, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Bavaria,
Japan, Java, Egvpt and stacks of other places beat
the Ma Land badly in sudden multiplication.
The other main proposition of “George Street”
is that one acre of closely-cultivated land anil
support a family of four, so that there is still plenty
of room. In looking for that kind of theoretical
land the seeker necessarily leaves out a huge, cold
slab of America, Asia and Europe, the great deserts
of Africa and Asia, the fairly-big deserts of
America (Mojave, Atacama, etc.), the big, dry part
of Australia; also vast areas of mountain and table-
land where the principal crops are rocks, ice and
wind; also lakes, Great Salt Lakes, inland seas, Dead
Seas, volcanoes and sundries. There isn’t very-
much land of the kind “George Street” indicates
to experiment on, and it may easily require all the
fertiliser that two whole acres can produce to feed
the one pet and pampered bit of hypothetical soil
that is to support four assumed people. The most
intensely cultivated country in the world, Belgium,
hasn’t managed by a very long way to support its
own 600 folk per square mile, let alone the 2560
of whom “George Street” discourses. The trouble
is that people want meat and wool and leather, and
it is impossible to put many sheep and cattle and
horses on an acre. The ox won’t grow in a flower-
pot. Then forests are required to supply furniture,
firewood, ships, buildings, etc., etc., and forests
require a lot of breathing-room. They seldom
flourish under the bed. Mines, factories, foundries,
houses, wharves, railways, reservoirs, water-catchment
areas, warehouses, shipyards, canals, schools, univer-
sities, shops, hospitals, roads, public parks and
other things are also great eaters of space.
According to “George Street's*' interesting theory
the people of Sydney and suburbs could have grown
all their food and all other necessaries within their
own municipal boundaries until about 1891, while
Melbourne could still do so and have a handsome
surplus for export. Considering that the area used
to catch water for Sydney is itself twice as big as
the city this seems crowded, but it may be feasible.
Anyhow, Melbourne, with its heifers —enough to sup-
ply moat and milk and hides and bone-dust for
650,000 people—grazing on 1000 hills within the
domain of the Mayor and corporation, and its wide-
spread and umbrageous forest on the premises, and
its miles of grain waving all over Elsternwick, and
its Yan Yean reservoir right there, and its skipping
lambs on the tram-line along with its skipping hogs
would be a better city than it is now.
Hughes in the Freak Change Act.
W. M. Hughes has once more started to
make a din in England about matters of
which he has no authority whatever to speak
in the name of Australia. The amazing
part is that he has directed his outcry
against the holy bulwarks of Freetrade.
Hughes was a Freetrader in days when tin-
fiscal controversy seemed to mean something,
lie continued to be a Freetrader in the deplor-
able fiscal-sinking days before the war ; and
never by any political act during his lease
of power has he proved to the Common-
wealth that he has repented of his sin or
seen the folly of his ways. The Labor
party, of which he was once the chief pillar,
was almost solid for Protection; there was
a majority for it in the opposing party; but
Protection of a kind that would really pro*,
tect Australian industry was never carried
into law. The main cause of all the fiscal-
sinking and “ducking” which marked those
vital years was the prominence of the Free-
trader W. M. Hughes in the Labor ranks.
Now this same man suddenly dashes into
English politics, to attack the ruinous policy
wbieh in Australia ho had always so strenu-
ously supported! As a lightning-change
artist a politician of this sort would take a
lot of beating; hut the explanation is not
far to seek. It is no direct concern of Aus-
tralia ; but there is an uncomfortable feeling
that Such representation in London as that
of Hughes is dangerous in that he might
just as readily have linked the name of the
Commonwealth with even more delicate
affairs in Bull’s domestic circle than the
fiscal policy if it had suited the party bosses’
purposes.
The Spider Addresses a Few Words to
the Fly.
There Seemed at the'beginning of the week,
according to the Leakage of Scraps of News
Department, that the battle on the Western
Front was ready to flare up again. The
meaning of this was that the German had
cleared up the wreckage left from recent
collisions and appeared ready to hit again.
How much weight he can put behind his
wallop remains to be seen, hut taking all
the circumstances into consideration it is
not much use expecting to hear of the pro-
ceedings being on a limited scale, or to be
excessively confident about what the address
of the Front will be a fortnight later. Mean-
while the most important happening heard
about has been a speech made in the Reich-
stag by Yon Kuiilmann, the Foreign Min-
ister, wherein he spoke of the impossibility
of expecting a complete military victory
and suggested peace by negotiation. This
has been variously interpreted. It is said
to have made a tremendous sensation in Ger-
many. The militarists of Prussia are
reported to regard Von Kuiilmann as a
“defeatist” and to be demanding his head.
The Kaiser is alleged to be in a tremendous
rage. To all of this a substantial helping
of salt can be given, for the utterances of
a Minister in the Reichstag differ very
materially from the speeches of a Minister
in, say, Britain or France. It is no more
reasonable to. suppose that Yon Kuiilmann
spoke without preliminary assent being
given to his speech by the Kaiser than that
he addressed the Reichstag while standing
on his head. Naturally, with immense con-
quests on hand elsewhere, the war in the
West is calamitous to Germany and she
would gladly end the trouble there—if the
Allies would let those conquests which
would make her mistress of Europe stand.
This is what Kuhlmann is after. And
when he speaks, for the Kaiser, of peace
without victory in the West, it is not inap-
propriate to recollect that the same man was
the pliant tool of Wilhelm in the negotia-
tions with the Russians at Brest-Lovinsk.
Kuhlmann went there with talk about, “no
annexations” and promises of German readi-
ness for “an honorable peace.” This kept
the opponents. of annexations in Germany
quiet, and while they were being fooled by
Kuhlmann the Russians were being fooled,
and all hands woke up to find the dismember-
ment of Russia in full operation. He is
now turning on the same sort of talk for
consumption elsewhere, and while he is
doing it Lupendorff is preparing to bash his
way through to Paris. There is no cleavage
in the aims of the governing classes in Ger-
many, except possibly differences of opinion
about whether it would not be cheaper to end
America.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
War struck his gong. The lands were
drenched in blood.
Men thought you craven at that first loud
call,
Forgetful of those days ivlien, as a flood,
Your manhood rose that tyranny might fall;
When, lest one slave should live in your free
land.
You set old Freedom’s trumpet to your
mouth
And blew your thunderous message to the
South
That all the world your truth might under-
stand.
Truth, Faith and Freedom sang your cradle-
song.
At Plymouth Rock the deep foundation set
Of that new dream that overawes the strong,
Remains through changing years unshaken
yet.
Where Stanihsii strode along the forest’s
hem
Stout hearts beat ever for Man’s nobler right;
And in the tempest of the world’s black night
A dying Europe calls in hope to them.
France, England, bleeding for the truth of
Peace,
Stand mightily against the surging foe.
Vainly the flames and agonies increase
Where the grim legions' stagger to and fro.
Death gluts all fields, but Wrong with iron
power
Still forces the red battle in the West.
The balance trembles in" the vast world-test
It is the crowning and decisive hour.
You might have stayed beyond your guarding
sea,
Nursing in safety all your hands had won,
Hearing the wheels sing- to eternity
A song of endless peaceful tasks begun.
But you were fashioned in another mould :
In splendid pride you heard the call of
Man —• *
From east to west the fiery message ran—
“We seek the paths our fathers trod of old.
“Wrong to the meanest thing in this broad
world
Is wrong to us. We take the fatal field
Till the drums cease and all the flags are
furled,
And the last despotism break and yield.
Not for the hope of gain nor fear of loss.
But for the faith of Man we make our stand,
With all the strength of an awakened land
Facing the horror of war’s iron cross. ’
There shall be victory. The battle breaks
Into a wilder discord at the last.
The nations tremble and the broad earth
shakes
In storms unknown to her tempestuous past.
Comes the last awful clash of faith and fear ;
And through the maddened clamor of the
guns
The clear, strong Avorcl of final triumph
runs — . .
“Courage, brave hearts! America is here .

Allies would evaporate, leaving Germany a
big winner.
-
The manager of the, Bank of New Zealand,
announcing a really elegant profit (in paper
money mostly) took occasion to remark that
“it was the expenditure of borrowed money
which was creating this prosperity.” It is a
solemn truth, but few bankers have the
courage to admit it. Big local loans floated
mostly in paper money that is only good here
and spent here because it can’t be spent any-
where else, are just the old Victorian land
boom on a bigger scale. In those days
Brown sold land to Smith at a huge price,
and Smith sold land to Brown at a gigantic
price, and Brown was rich with Smith’s
bill, and Smith was rich with Brown’s pro-
missory-note bbth of them discounted by
Robinson’s bank. But when the documents
fell due Brown found Smith had no real
money, and Smith found the same concerning
Brown. So neither paid, and Robinson’s
bank was left with the land, which it tried to
sell to Jenkins, but he had no real money
either.
Everard im Tiiurn, sometime Governor of
Ffgi and High Commissioner of the Western
Pacific, understands his old German neigh-
bors a good deal better now than when he
was actually on the spot. Dr. Sole, ex-
Governor of German Samoa, is now Imperial
Colonial Secretary in Berlin, im Tiiurn. who
met him frequently in the Pacific, saw no
reason then to regard him as a scheming or
crafty Hun ; but now, gazing back with larger
knowledge and clearer vision, he recognises
that Solf and his subordinates were playing
their cards with remarkable skill and pursu-
ing a deeply-laid, carefully-planned plot to
dominate the Pacific and Indian oceans.
Captains of German warships were very
keen and diligent in their surveys among
the islands, and Governor im Tiiurn
had on several occasions to call their
attention to breaches of the inter-
national regulations. On reporting these
facts to the Colonial Office he was
assured that the matter was of no import-
ance, and that the Germans were actuated
solely by love of science. That was to be
expected from the Colonial Office, but im
Tiiurn has not the slightest doubt now
that the Squareheads were deliberately
selecting, surveying and preparing naval
bases for a war which they knew was
coming. Had hostilities developed on the
lines they anticipated, these bases would have
been used to attack traders and troopships,
and, no doubt, the Australian coast.
•
Dear Bulletin, —The sinking of the Wim-
mera between Maoriland and Australia is a
reminder —if any reminder was required after
the Wolf episode—that, despite all our won-
derful luck, the tail-end of the war is at our
doors. There are suspicions that mine-sowing
goes on even to-day by peaceful-looking
vessels, and that the numerous Hun or Hun
agent who stalks abroad, and talks treason
openly and is allowed to howl at the decent
Australian as if he were a slave or a dog,
may possibly be directing the business by a
widespread signalling system and other
devices which officialdom looks upon with a
deaf eye and pursues with unseeing feet.
After the discovery that an unregistered
alien with a Hun name, who hadn’t even the
excuse or justification of long service, had
been put in charge of the points at Hawkes-
bury Bridge—the one place where the Aus-
tralian railway system can be cut in two
after a fashion which would involve two
years repairing work, and the coal supply
isolated—l think officialdom is capable of
many things. How about beginning the new
era with an overhaul of officialdom—the
naturalised Huns, the people of recent Hun
descent, the Huns who have changed their
names, the people who say they are German-
Swiss or Norwegian or Swedish, but who
look too much like Huns, the people who talk
Hun sympathies, the men with Hun wives
and friends and connections and half-Hun
children—these last are very important.
Then perhaps the blind ear of officialdom
would wake up and its unhearing feet would
get a move on.—Yours, etc., Herman Hogg.
Alexander Turnbull, formerly associated
with the firm of W. and G. Turnbull, mer-
chants, of Wellington (M.L.), died a few days
ago at 49. Being a merchant was the least
important part of Alex. Turnbull’s life. He
was a book-collector of exceptional industry
and judgment, and leaves behind what is cer-
tainly the finest private library ever gathered
together in Maoriland, and in some respects
one of the most valuable in the world. He
was very keen on first editions of manuscripts!,
but it was his accumulation of letters, pam-
phlets, books and maps relating to M.L.,
from its very beginning, which gave his
library particular value. It is far more com-
plete than the Hocken collection, for Turn-
bull was to M.L. what Mitchell was to N. S.
Wales. For many years this almost price-
less collection was housed in the big ram-
shackle old Turnbull home, built of timber, in
Bowen-street. Wellington, where the bachelor
Alex, lived —almost inviting destruction by
fire. Subsequently it was removed to safer
quarters, and The Bulletin understands
that the greater part becomes the property
of the nation. The dead man was one of
three brothers —Bob and Will were the other
two—a quiet, unassuming citizen, for many
years addicted to yachting.
Resolution adopted by the Perth Inter-
State Labor Conference :
Proclamation for compulsory military service must
contain express declaration of immediate peril to
Australia, and must within 14 days be laid before
both Houses, either of which may veto it.
And. of course, if Immediate Peril is a
gentleman it. will wait courteously on the
doormat while the jobbing parties of which
Parliament is composed wrangle for a politi-
cal advantage.
The old Sydney Water Police Court, where
the bray of the ass was often drowned by
the roar of escaping steam from the ferry-
boats lying at Circular Quay, was closed
without any official fuss during the week.
The old place didn’t even fine itself ss.
by way of farewell. Two old magistrates
also climbed do wn at the end of the week.
One was Smitlhers, the beak who made
a lot of people feel uncomfortable during
his turn as president of a military exemption
court. The other was Love, who once fined
a firm £33,000 for boiling down sheep with-
out the necessary permission.
Something must be behind the amazing
proposition made in the N.S.W. Assembly
that wheat certificates should not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange, because . “greedy
speculators” buy them up. The Stock Ex-
change quotation tells the farmer that the
value of his certificate, fixed by open com-
petition, is perhaps Is. per bushel. If no
such knowledge was available the “greedy
speculator” might get it for 3d. and pre-
tend that he was doing a favor at that. A
fine opening for the affable hawk would
present itself if the quotation was abolished.
Who was the person that devised the
idea of secrecy, and had the front to profess
that the farmer should he prevented, in his
own interests, from knowing what price is
offering for his goods? He was a man of
“front” ; the front of Parliament House isn’t
a circumstance to him,.
“The Oldest Inhabitant’s” pubs:—
The premises on the S.E. corner of Pitt and King
streets announced as for auction sale were built in
or about 1881, but the memories of the corner belong to
Old Sydney. The land is understood to be one of
old Sam Terry’s properties. In 1817 he had a pub
in Pitt-street called The Grapes, but it was in or
near where the Angel Hotel is now. Eighty years ago
a red brick two-storey inn stood on the Pitt-King
corner known as the Elephant and Castle, The first land-
lord was Charles Morris. Before taking the house
lie had The Australian on the N.E. corner of Kent and
Market streets, and afterwards he had the Free-
masons’ Arms in Pitt-street, near the Victoria
Theatre. In 1844 Philip Solomon ran the Elephant
arid Castle, and about 100 yards away George Coppin,
of theatre fame, conducted the Clown Tavern, which
he took over from Bill Dind, also of theatre note.
Coppin lost all his savings in the house. The E. and C.
continued under the old name until the first
’seventies, when Frank Underwood changed the name
to the Surrey. About ’Bl it was demolished to make
way for the present building.
About a month ago N. S. Wales Govern-
ment wiped away the cold perspiration that
had been gathering under its hat and decided
that it could face the world with a light
heart. Up to that stage the cash-book had
looked about .as cheerful as an aged camel.
Revenue had slumped over half a million
during the big strike, and the odds against
being able to dodge another deficit seemed
hundreds to nothing. But the income-tax
harvest turned out to be a record, increased
railway charges helped fill the void, and the
financial year closed on Saturday with a
surplus of £23,824. “War prosperity” had
saved the situation. New sources of revenue
tapped last year, the increased incomes of
pastoralists and certain traders and more
copious land sales lifted ordinary revenue
by £461,690, and the railways annexed
£438.181 more than before. The net all-
round increase is £1,048.884. instead of
£1,878,000 estimated. The happenings
early in the year and the recovery in the
last lap threw estimates up in the air.
Three months ago there were fears of a
deficit of £400,000.
When, lately, N. S. Wales Health Min-
ister J. D. Fitzgerald noticed two ex-soldiers
among the patients in Maitland
he was moved to this mild protest:—, |?f
The Federal Government had, whenever:3they dis-
covered an incurable case in one/of <the hospitals
under their care, got the soldier patient to accept a
discharge, and he then immediately’ became a care on
the State.
If words mean anything Fitzgerald’s are a
definite charge against the Defence Depart-
ment of shunting its responsibility to in-
capacitated Billjim, and doing it by what
looks like pretty fine practice at that.

THE MAN WHO CAME BACK.
[For The Bulletin.]
Young Potter was an ass indeed, devoid of mental
meekness,
Whose New York aunt could merely plead for pity
for his “weakness”
When Potter pere, the millionaire, this costly boy’s
creator,
Announced that he no more would be his doting
liquidator.
When told to earn a yearly screw (a smaller sum
in dollars
Than what he had been used to blew in silken ties
and collars)
Young Potter had no sense of shame; he smilingly
protested
That he would make, his dada’s name dishonored and
detested.
To San Francisco he was sent. In drinking and in
gorging
He revelled to his heart’s content before he took
to forging:
And nightly, at a garish hell where he was known
and noted,
He met his guiding Starr Marcelle, to whom he was
devoted.
A singer she in gaudy togs, a virgin plump and
supple:
And he the gayest of gay dogs—an interesting couple.
One midnight, being full of wine, he begged the maid
he trusted
To be his loving mistress, and Oh, dear! she was
disgusted.
Old Potter tried again to save the winer and the
diner:
His minions chloroformed the knave, and shipped
him off to China,
But when Marcelle found Harry gone—without \ a
word departed—
She went to Shanghai on her own, alone and broken-
hearted.
The waster dude had made a point of going to the
Devil,
So down at Chew thing's opium-joint he reached his
proper level;
He staggered in profoundly drunk, though still in-
clined to joking,
And through the deadly stink there slunk his goddess,
pale with smoking.
Then did salvation come to each. She offered him
her -Virtue,
But Harry gazed upon his peach and cried, “I’d
blush to hurt you.”
And she replied, “Thou shalt not smoke or drink,
beloved honey.”
To life’s reulities they woke in bonds of matrimony.
Their former selves they simply loathed, this pair
of wedded Potters.
In righteousness discreetly clothed they had no time
for rotters.
For drink and smoke they’d ceased to care ; to cut
the story shorter,
At last the New York millionaire took Marcelle for
his “dorter.”
Young Harry, when he kneels to pray, at night or
morniqg early,
Thanks Heaven for the cabaret where erst he met
his girlie;
And Marcelle, as she lies abed, the Word of God
perusing,
Invokes a blessing on the head of good old Shanghai
Chew-Ching.
Conversion is a blessed thing which singles out the
sinner.
With peasant or anointed king it’s bound to be a
winner;
Conversion comes to any men or girls who care to
risk it.
If they be in an opium-den—well then it takes the
biscuit.
The foregoing synopsis of “The Man Who
Came Back,” at the Royal (Melb.), states
practically everything worth mentioning
about that unwholesome drama, except that
its fourth act happens at Honolulu, where a
detective in the employ of old-man Potter
desires Mrs. Potter, junior, to go astray.
She sends her husband, the prodigal, back to
bis father, but slie still declines to take the
wrong turning seemingly. Therefore the
detec', sends a favorable report to her father-
in-law, who decides to receive the remark-
able young person into his gilded family. Of
several American plays concerning absurd
millionaire fathers and their deplorable only
sons, this is the least amusing. Also it is
the one with the longest space of intermission
between acts. If there ever was an air of
probability about the plot it must have blown
itself away during the four long intervals last
Saturday. Possibly
a hero who carried
more weight than
Louis Kimball, and
a heroine more
incisively audible
than Miss Starr
would be better
able to camouflage
the glaring un-
naturalism of the
play ; but, anyhow,
it gets all the act-
ing the author
deserves, and Up-
ward’s scenery does
it more than jus-
tice. Pleasing dance
items are contri-
buted to the cabaret
episode by George
Welch, Annie Sed-
don, dashing Kitty
Downes and others,
also Belbridge, in
the capacity of a
Voice from a n
opium bunk, utters
a howling mono-
logue accompani-
ment to the course
of events in Chew
Ching’s joint. For
the rest, there are
“The Man Who Came
Bade,” at Melbourne
Royal.
Muriel Starr, as Mar-'
celle, saying she loves
him.
Stynn and Marion Marcus dtfrke in
parts that matter, and Frank Harvey, as a
casual caotain who is finally alleged to be
a detective.
The idea of a blow on the cranium turn-
ing a young and respectable matron into a
successful despoiler of amorous old men is
broached with an air of scientific plausibility
in “De Luxe Annie,” which reached King’s
(Melb.) on Saturday. The story is related
much in the manner of a previous crimo-
drama called “On Trial,” but the episodes,
which reveal the temporary extinction of
Mrs. Julie Kendal in the criminal person-
ality of “Silky Ann,” are fitted together
with a skill that never leaves the slightest
chink in the narrative. It is worth while
ignoring the conspiracy to restore Annie
to a sense of moral responsibility merely to
watch the author, Edward Clark, planning
unobtrusively for a stunning climax. The
little affair of the cut hand and the bottle
of acid in Act 2 is an eloquent case in
point, and shows that Edward is the equal
of George M. Cohan in the technicalities of
his craft. In the last act, the summer cot-
tage at New Canaan, Connecticut, where the
subconscious Julie’ is slowly awakened by
the sight of many familiar objects, there is
a stronger surrender to improbability,
though it must be admitted that the seem-
ingly far-fetched incident of Jimmie Fitz-
patrick donning Hal Kendal’s clothes is not
sufficiently Unlikely to damage the drama-
tist’s achievement. Undoubtedly his diver-
sion is based on some audacious assumptions,
but he is so dexterous in producing the
shock of surprise that the incredulous scoff
dies away in the throat.
“De Luxe Annie” is produced with flaw-
less detail. Annie’s flat on the Riverside
Drive, New York, with its decorative panels
and bevelled-glass doors, is a delicate intima-
tion of her outrageous prosperity. Also the
hurrying scenery past the window of the
Pullman, where the yarn is told between
cigars by Dr. Niblo, only needs to be sup-
ported by a bit of smoke and noise to make
the illusion of travel complete. As regards
the acting, it is almost equally divided
between Cyril Mackay and Emelie Polini.
Mackay. as Jimmie Fitzpatrick, Annie’s wist-
ful partner in blackmail, gets every thrill of
realism from the part. Emelie Polini, as
Annie, exercises her art very gracefully
indeed, and in the sentimental passages with
Clarence Blakiston employs a rare voice.
Blakiston, as the unaccountable husband,
Kendal, uses the same grey face for every
situation; and the sagacity of detective
Cronin is hidden under the hard black hat
of Harmon Lee. G. Kay Souper absorbs the
treasures of the dictionary to formulate the
theories of Dr. Niblo; Maurice Dudley
quavers over the goatee of old Cyrus Munroe ;
and Olive Wilton appears once in the
foreground as the retired spieleress, Mrs.
Archer. The darkie waiter (Charles Pope)
is a spectacle of bowlegged efficiency.
Whether his efficiency is responsible for his
bowleggedness or his bowleggedness enables
him to carry an extra supply of efficiency is
a matter for conjecture.
All goes well with tuneful “Katinka” at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.). An amended pro-
gram reveals the fact that the girlie who

" The Bing Boys” ended a good season at
the Royal (Adelaide) with a jolly farewell
evening, at which Jack Cannot achieved his
great ambition Of making all his colleagues
(and most of the orchestra) laugh at the
wrong moment. The dancing of Mae Baird
and the rest is a leading feature in the
show; but Clyde Cook should cut out the
tedious talk before lie starts his fine foot-
work. Also there is nothing attractive about
the ballet, in walking dress, hauling up its
skirts to expose old-fashioned white under-
wear. The eo. has moved on towards Maori-
land. Melodrama at the Tivoli was chiefly
remarkable for a bit of “intense” acting by
Darcy Kelway, as a change from his usual
comic business. Kelly and Drake, at the
Majestic, were genuinely funny, and the
veteran Philip Newbury, still in great voice,
was enthusiastically received. The King’s

The main point about “The Thirteenth
Chair.” in which Margaret Wycherly pre-
sented herself for the first time in Australia
at the Criterion (Sydney) on Saturday, is
that furniture- has nothing to do with it.
Nor has the arithmetic incidental to the title
even a remote relation to the story. And the
purpose or intention of the play is just as
hard to determine as the reason for the
christening. These reflections do not prevent
the drama—if it is drama—from being well
worth inspection, nor do they suggest that
the piece is not able to keep an audience in
a grip that never slackens. Who killed
Spencer Lee—Lee who was found dead in
his lodgings Murdered by a knife thrust
between his shoulders? The police failed to
unravel the mystery. Enter then, Edward
Wales, chum of the dead man, and Rosalie La
Grange, an alleged medium. There are 13
in the room. Seated in a circle, with doors
locked, they hold a “stance,” Rosalie being
tied to a chair. Down go the lights. In the
darkness the ‘“spirit control” transpires,
making inquiries through the medium on
behalf of the defunct Lee for Wales. Pressed
by Wales to give the name of the murderer
the spook falters; there is a groan, a shriek,
the lights are switched up, and Wales pitches
off his chair —dead. He had been stabbed
through the back like Lee. The murderer of
both was in the room. Rosalie La Grange
remains tied hands and feet to her chair. As
a matter of fact, there had been a prelimi-
nary frame-up between her and Wales, but
the plot had gone farther than either dreamed
of, and the woman knew no more who had
slain Lee than who had taken the life of his
mate in Roscoe Crosby’s sitting-room. The
rest is a swift sequence of wrong suspicions,
unjust accusation, muddle and lying. The
odds against anyone being able to Sherlock
the culprit in ten tries up to within lOsec.
of the nerve collapse under a guilty con-
science are long and certain. It is this that
gives “The Thirteenth Chair” its grip.

Like nearly all the later American plays it
moves quickly and surely. There is nothing-
superfluous about this play, either in dia-
logue, action or setting. The scene is simple
and unchanged. The characters keep to the
point, there are no comic interludes and few
tear-showers. That the proceedings are
wildly impossible and that the builder of the
play had at the finish to fall back on the
device of getting Providence to make ghostly
revelations in answer to the prayers of the
medium, who was a confessed cheat and lived
by artifice, matters nothing. If there had
been no revelation there would have been no
discovery of the criminal, who had to be
found somehow.
* * * *
Margaret Wycherly plays the part of the
crafty old medium with a fine restraint and
sense of dramatic values. She has a part of
great difficulty— certainly one that could
easily be made preposterous by over emphasis
of emotion. She seems to have a wise appre-
ciation of the difference between humor and
farce. The play is remarkably well oast.
Lizette Parkes, the temporarily persecuted
daughter of Rosalie, fits the picture to a. line.
This page finds great difficulty in taking
New York s alleged inspectors of police seri-
ously, and the cop who blunders heavily
through the mysterious deaths of Lee and
Wales doesn’t help to make the job any
easier. But if the Johns thereabouts are
ot the type the local dramatist makes them
then this one at least seems human and
reasonably sane. Who killed Spencer Lee?
" r ell. if someone explained that Othello
strangled his wife and later on committed
hara-kiri it wouldn't matter much to anyone
who wanted to see those unhappy episodes.
Lut if it was known in advance who slew
Lee-—well, that brings the difference between
Shakspeare and the man who created “The
I hirteenth Chair ’ into the argument. And
as it would be a fool of an argument, the
criminal is allowed to escape mention.

“The Masquerader” arrived at the Palace
on Saturday, and as much of Sydney as could
get into the theatre was there' to meet Chil-
cote-Loder-I ost. The American star didn’t
disappoint anybody; there were recalls after
e\eiy curtain. The audience was gripped
at the outset by the accidental meet-
ing in the. foggy prologue, with the river
boats hooting mournfully, of the dumb
Cmlcote (played by an unnamed actor)
hanging on to the stage lamp-post, and Loder
II ost) the hard-up journalist, who did all
the conversation in two voices, and supplied
the eminent drunk with the visiting-card and
cigar-light which set the plot going. Then
with a careless, self-contemptuous “Good-
night,’ Loder saunters off round the corner
and the curtain rustles down, to rise a few
minutes later on Chilcote doing a morning-
after sleep on his library floor. After that
the hard-working Post only gets a brief
chance to be the decent, hard-working press-
man who keeps his dog in his lodgings and
talks inflated rot to the landlady’s daughter,
a simple lass, who says “Lor’, "sir!” at fre-
quent intervals. After a newspaper has sent
him a cheque and used his article as an
editorial, in bursts the drug-dazed Chilcote
and urges his. scribbling double to make the
great speech in the Commons. (The play
belongs to the period when the English still
thought the war could be won by making
speeches.) Chilcote falls asleep on Loder’s
couch, and in comes Brock, the faithful
valet-guardian of countless generations of
Chilcotes. and. mistaking Loder for Chil.,
urges him to come home until he is
knocked down for being an old fool. Con-
vinced of his mistake he urges Loder to go
to the House and make his helpless boss’s
speech, and Loder reluctantly goes. After-
wards the delighted populace take the elo-
quent impostor home to Chil’s house, where
Chil’s. wife promptly accepts him as the old-
established drug-fiend. (Nothing could be
wilder, but the play is done so well that the
eager playgoer swallows his mirth.) It
subsequently transpires that the only person
who sees through Loder’s tremendous bluff
is the society dame who flirts and “dopes”
with him. She spots the tell-tale scar on
his finger just after she has swallowed the
dose of morphia she had prepared for herself
and Chilcote. (Evidently what English
society wants is more morphia to brighten it
up.) When the likeable Loder becomes the
detestable Chilcote he has to imitate as far
as possible the unpleasant Chilcote charac-
teristics, and he is just becoming unchilled
to the other fellow’s yearning widow when
the curtain falls, leaving the playgoer won-
dering if the keen society flirt will drug her-
self out before her infuriated babblings about
the Great Chilcote Fraud are listened to.
The impression is left that a woman with
her extraordinary capacity for dope would
last long enough to bowl out several im-
postors.
Post gets through his double job with
first-class honors. One lias at times the
fleeting impression that Chilcote sober is a
bit too stagey; but Chilcote drugged is
very convincing, and Chilcote choking and
dying by lamplight, with his shadow groping

set in the time when Europe was ringing

and O’Shea, an officer under the Corsican,
had penetrated the Prussian dine disguised
as a half-witted gipsy. Rose McMichael.
travelling to a dying parent, is captured by
the Prussians and brought into camp as a
prisoner. To save her from the kind of fate
that might be expected in tl at locality,
O’Shea marries her; then his Irish gallantry
prompts liipr to woo the lacy in true-
love fashion. From there the play is
taken up with O’Shea’s pursuit of the lady,
with a happy ending at Dublin. Like all
Doone’s productions, the play is clean and
wholesome, and Allen himself has never done
better work. His admirers, on Saturday
night could only be persuaded to go home
after he had come before the curtain and
sung “The Wearin’ of the Cireen.” Edna
Iveeley, as the petulant belle of Dublin, also
got the loud hand. Tom Buckley, as
Roderick O’Toole, was particularly happy

O’Dowd a natural young woman; and
these, with Maurice Lynch, as McNabb, the

Flossie Lusk, as Mrs. Hugg, does her best
to look a bad-tempered matron of 36. It's
a difficult job for the new girl. Frith ambles
idiotically through the show as the cheerful
dipsomaniac in green pyjamas who treats his

day.
Ada Reeve and tenor Balboni stand at
the head of present Tivoli (Sydney) bill.
Xeiman and Kennedy, the admirable black-
faced team, come next, and then little Lucie
Linda dances in. One of the merriest spec-
tacles of the show is the stiff-legged scoot
round a base-drum done by a comedian-
drummer dressed like Johnny Coleman, the
“scarecrow dancer” of years ago. It is in-
cidental to a turn which otherwise drags.
The two teamsters should build up their act
to that clever bit of eccentric business.
The Frivolities, a costume comedy crowd,

The Haymarket is offering an attractive
Paramount three-course hill of fare, with
Sessue Hayalcawa providing the pickings.
He is a secret-service man in a story of
political intrigue and domestic love called
“The Secret Game.” Vivian Martin, as the
careful daughter who goes to the big city
to look after mother, makes “The Sunset
Trail” an appetising entrOe; while the
sweets and savories are handed out by
“Those Athletic Girls.” The Empress is
rustling with the silk of jockey coats as
they flash round the course in Nat Gould’s
“A Gamble for Love.” The interest centres
around a fair girl, two good horses, a great
race and a cheque for £30,000. (Sixpence
will give you the inside running to the lot.)
Clara Kimball Young, looking very hand-
some, changes her hat and frock quite fre-
quently on the Crystal Palace screen in her
part of a rich, young and neglected French
wife who wants to make hubby sit up and
take notice of what he’s missing; and Gladys
BroekweU’s dual role in “The Moral Law”
gives her a chance to display to Lyceum
audiences each of the thousand different
expressions her press-agent claims for her.
She doesn’t quite succeed; but then the
actress who can live up to her press-agent
has not yet been born.
Russia has Bed (siiardB.-a.ntl White Guards,

Sydney Telegraph on costly fashions:—
There is only one reason why a woman changes the
style of her dress. Because the other woman does it.
Fashions being ruinous, why not abolish the
Other Woman, at least till the war is over?
She has always been a trouble (often end-
ing in divorce), like Rumor, Casus Belli,
A Voice (at public meetings), and others
of that ilk —whatever an ilk may be.
From Petrograd :
We have celebrated the first anniversary of “the
reign of Liberty,” despite protests from our hollow
stomachs. Meat, mostly horse, aggravated by age
and emaciation, is 7s. 6d. a lb. for the most degraded
portions, but one needs to have a friend in the right
place to get a fragment of honest steak. Butter and
sugar are practically unprocurable at 365. and
375. 6d.. per lb., but an undergrown specimen of the
potato is available at about 10s. a lb. in English
money, and a little flour can be had for 12s. 6d.
a lb. Bread has fluctuated between 4s. and 17s. 6d.
a lb., and it is nothing to see a mass of furs from the
aristocratic quarter joining a queue to get a share.
Still the Bolshevik system of inflating the currency
provides many People with enough ready paper to buy
an existence at those crazy prices. It is said that
there are 40,000,000,000 1 roubles in circulation, and
the floating wealth is only limited by the capacity of
the printing press and the shortage of paper. Life,
at time of writing, is a vodka-sodden Utopianism
that travesties the wildest tyrannies of the old
regime. Vladimir, the metropolitan of Kiev, a harm-
less ecclesiastic of 75, was lately driven out of his
cathedral, stripped naked and butchered in the street
by a mob. Knots of unknown corpses occasionally
festoon peaceful doorsteps, whilst woman of all classes
are the prey of beasts who prowl in undesirable
quantities. Recently Lenin and Trotsky ukased that
the few big pubs in Petrograd must supply a certain
number of cheap meals irrespective of the cost to the
proprietor or his ability to get provisions. It is a
mad Russia, but it is absurd to say that it has gone
to the Devil. The Devil has come to Russia bringing
a horde of greasy visionaries and ruffians mouthing
discarded anarchies and perpetrating a thousand
evils.

If the Attorney-General approves, the share-
holders are going to have another < bite: the
directors think the time has come when one
bonus share for every 10 now held may be
safely distributed, the capital being provided
“from reserve funds accumulated, prior to
June 30, 1014.” It would be hard to pick
them out; but it lias to be put that way or
the Commonwealth Treasury would want a
bite, too. From one point of view share-
holders won't be any better off, of course; for
the reserves are theirs already—those re-
serves, at least, which are not specifically set
apart to protect the debenture-holders. Blit
they will have another share to sell, if they
want to sell, or another to bring a dividend
to them if they prefer to hold. Still, tin 1
directors probably won’t as a rule, divide
more in the aggregate than they would if the
capital wasn't increased. At any rate, they
don’t even make a pretence of keeping the
rate of dividend steady. In the past seven
years, since the last distribution of bonus
shares was made, the dividend has moved
between 10 and 20 p.c., according, generally,
to the season's profits.
Than the past 25 years' history of this eo.
nothing better shows the remarkable recu-
perative powers of this great country of
ours. After the boom of the late ’eighties
and early ’nineties the eo. was nearly down
and out. Some of the subsequent reconstruc-
tions* don’t make pleasant reading. How-
ever. that is ancient history. What is of
most interest now is that so lately as l!)0(i
the reserves were under £lOO.OOO. arid the
dividend in that year was only 5 p.c. on a
capital of £550.000. Since then the profits
not distributed by way of dividend have
amounted to £746,213, of which £602.472 has
been added to reserves and £143.741 distri-
buted as bonus capital. .Meantime a divi-
dend of 15 p.c. has been averaged—in all
£1.150,735, equal to 17 p.c. p.a. on the capi-
tal as it stood in 1007 ; and the shareholders
have provided no capital since then. Cer-
tainly it hasn't been all profit from current
business; some of it lias been so-called profit
made by selling previously written-down
assets, and the capitalisation of those profits
is a fair thing. Australia was taught a
lesson in those days of gloom. In scores of
instances the writing-down was done too
severely, and weak shareholders suffered
more than they should have done, to the great
advantage of those who could hang on.'
This co.’s weak features in the old days
have disappeared. The next comparison
shows tin l changes that have been made in
the past 10 years:—

“Other liabilities” now total only £137,891);
all the other debt is fixed. Creditors cannot
therefore compromise the co. and its clients
by forcing sales at the most inopportune
time —which is the time that depositors and
creditors on open account generally choose to
make their most urgent demands. The co.
could almost pay off its open liabilities out of
its till-money. Its liquid assets are just
upon 50 p.c. of its total liabilities, debentures
included. Of those debentures, or debenture
stock. 60 p.c. carries only 4 p.c.; and G.B.
and Co. ought to make a penny or two out
of that cheap money for a good many years
to come. Advances total £1,824,770. There
are no doubt risks in that lot. But it is safe
to say that no old dead accounts are in-
cluded ; arid, considering the assured future
of the pastoral industry, barring droughts
and rabbits, the co. will only have mis-
management to blame if it makes many bad
debts out of that million and three-quarters.
Station properties and stock have been gradu-
ally worked down to £283,024; and, in view
of the price of wool, there ought to be a bit
of a margin in that, too. Add the sweet com-
missions from the big price guaranteed for
the next two wool-clips; and the outlook for
this co. is very bright indeed. Drought may
hit it, certainly; but as it is placed now it
would take a very bad drought to cause it
serious losses of capital.

The rate of dividend recommended by the
directors was 8 p.c., which on a capital of
£300,000 would have absorbed £24,000. This
div., however, is paid “less income tax,” and
that brings the figures down as shown in the
last line. The Trust was formed in 1903 to
take over the assets of the English and Aus-
tralian Assets Co., the Federal Assets Co.
and the Melbourne Assets Co-, which them-
selves had taken over derelicts of the ’nine-
ties—-the City of Melbourne Bank, the
Federal Bank of Australia, and the
English and Australian Bank. Issued
capital was £273.333 in 1,300,000 shares
of 45., and £392,485 of 4 p.c. deben-
tures were allotted to shareholders and
creditors for their interests in the old wrecks.
The six years to 1909 were exceedingly pros-
perous, and salvage operations proved so
easy that the co. was enabled to discharge
the whole of its debenture debt Meantime
properties had appreciated in value to such
an extent with the good times that after un-
loading this liability of £392,485 the co.
found that the book value of its assets lfad
been reduced by only about £275,000. Then,
so that the Mercantile Bank Assets Co. could
bo brought into the fold, the Trust's assets
were re-valued and written-up. and £240.559
was distributed in debentures and cash. This
issue was gradually repurchased, generally
at a profit to the co.. as properties were un-
loaded, and by 3914 the debentures had been
entirely redeemed. This shows how the
figures have moved

The £38,087 now outstanding is portion of
£200,000 44 p.c. debentures issued for cash
in 1914. Last year there was a loss of £1866
on realisations, the management apparently
having accelerated the selling of some of
the least profitable properties while con-
ditions were favorable. Otherwise. the co.
had a good year; the returns from its Fiji
sugar estate and station properties and from
interest arid dividends totalling £46.566.
compared with £31,886 in 1916; £28,442 in
1915: and £40,846 in 1934. Liabilities
total £51,458. Of that £38,087 represents
the 44 p.c. debentures mentioned above, and
£3136 outstanding notes of the defunct
banks. Probably very little of that latter
amount will be called for.
At the beginning the Trust was to have
been practically little more than its own
undertaker, new investments having been
limited to £lO,OOO a year. But by 1909
everything was looking so well that the eo.
got definitely into the trust and investment
business. This shows the assets movements
since 1906:
Old Cos.’ Trust’s Purchasers’ Cash,
Assets. Investments. Balances. etc.

1917.. 296,232 90,174 68,128 5,243
So the co. is nowadays not dependent upon
surpluses on realisations for its income.
Apart from the profits from its station pro-
perties, there is also a dependable amount
coming in from the co.’s own invest-
merits (£38,300 is in War Loan), and good
interest is doubtless also being earned by
selling properties on long-deferred terms.

It is now 10 years since the co. began opera-
tions. Shortage of native labor has been the
chief trouble, and though there was an im-
provement during the year to March, 1917,
there was a falling-off last term : 201 laborers
having been paid off and 152 new hands
engaged, leaving a labor force of 386 at
March 31 last. In consequence, during the
past term only 213 acres have been prepared
for cultivation. The co. has now 3655 acres
under cocoanuts, 100 acres under rubber and
47 acres partly cleared. Of the cocoanut
areas 1450 acres are seven years or more
old and producing crops ; and in the rubber
section there are 5000 mature trees, of which
3000 are to remain untapped until the staff
has acquired more experience in the work.
Production has been considerably increased
during the past year:—
Copra. Rubber.
1916 . . 192 tons 417 lb.
1917 .. 274 „ 1414 ~
1918 .. 361 „ 2589 „
The output of copra would have been greater
last year had not a disease necessitated the
destruction of several hundred trees and re-
duced the crop from two of the estates. Net
proceeds from sales were £5696, compared with
£4078 for the previous year, and general and
administrative expenses absorbed £1460.
During the 12 months £11.280 was spent on
development, making a total outlay to date
of £01,838. Against that item - the co. has
so fffr accumulated out of profits a reserve
of £10,004. There are 1000 shares of £lOO
each, and £70,000 has now been paid
ui>. Liabilities amount to £14.737. Produce
on hand is reckoned to be worth £3027. and
there is only £4O in the till. So the Board
proposes to call up another £7 10s. per share,
in three monthly instalments, increasing
paid-up capital by £7500.

The record of this co. for the past’four years
makes sad reading for shareholders. „As
the table shows, a 10 p.c. div. or more bad
been regularly distributed with ease for
years. In 1914, when everything was
looking, bright—-gas stiles had more than
doubled in five years—-the co. capital-
ised £15,867 of reserves and got in a
lot of new capital at a premium of Bs. per
£1 share. However, this new issue did not
nearly provide for the financing of the new
works then in course of erection, and the
co. had to go to the bank, the result being a
debenture debt of £28,500. Since 1914 one
trouble has been heaped upon another. Costs
have soared to an alarming extent: the price of
coal supplies has been continually on the rise,
and during the past year the Industrial Court
increased wages by 44 p.c. The Gas Act
has also been sitting heavily on the co. This
Act came into operation on April 1 last year,
but the price for Townsville was not decided
upon until December. Meantime the co. was
compelled to charge the rates in force in
1915. Added to these troubles, the co. was
also seriously affected by three strikes last
year—the gas-workers’ strike in April,
the Northern railway disturbance and the big
N. S. Wales upheaval, which practically cut
off coal supplies. Consequently, last year’s
operations showed a very small margin of
profit—£2s9s after allowing for depreciation
—and shareholders get nothing. Capital is
£74,900, and there are liabilities totalling
£33,167. More or less liquid assets amount
to £10,615; sq the financial position is not
particularly cheerful. Four years ago
property and plant stood in the books at
£47,950; but the new works and the cost of
the land on which they were erected have
added over £52.000 to these items.

The ordinary dividend is at the rate of 10
l>.c. p.a.; and frequently a shilling bonus is
declared, and at the same time a call of Is.
is made. Ten years ago the paid capital was
£lO,OOO in 20,000 shares paid to 10s. ; now it
is £16,000, and the present bonus will make
the shares paid to 17s. Meantime the busi-
ness has increased quite satisfactorily; as at
April, 1908. the total was £1,121,372 and
now it is £2,171,933. The co/s own assets
are premises £12,871, War Loans and other
public securities £13,821, mortgages and
other advances £5029, and net cash and
sundries (apparently advances to estates)
£4494. What these produce the accounts do
not show; but at 4J p.c. they would show
just chough to pay the 10 p.c. dividend, leav-
ing all the profit from the business to go to
reserves. Nor is there any reason to expect
that the future will be less prosperous. The
trustee.cos. may have to reduce their charges
in the future or do more for their money—
probably under State competition—but the
circle of their clients will certainly go on
widening and widening.

This co. has not done at all badly during the
past half-year considering the shipping
shortage, the disturbance of the export trade
and the fact that the first couple of months
of the term were affected by the big strike.
The profit from trading in pre-war terms
was in the vicinity of £50,000; for the half-
year to March 31 it was £47,347. The co.
has had an interesting history. Thirteen
years ago, when the old property was nearly
worked out and profits were looking very
sick, some of the pref. shareholders asked
the Court to wind-up the co. Had they suc-
ceeded the ordinaries would not have got
back a penny of their capital. However,
the Court turned down the application and
the directors raised £20,000 of new’ capital
and went ahead developing the property they
had acquired at Cessnock. With what results
the table above partly shows. Two years
ago another property w r as purchased and
during the past six months it has been
brought to the producing stage, the coal
proving to be of first-class quality. Now
still another area is being purchased—-2500
.acres at Kalingo. on the South Maitland
field—and boring has proved the coal to be
“of the very highest quality and quite equal
to the best South Maitland.” So the co. at
present has tw’o producing mines and is
about to open up a third. Capital is
£llO,OOO (90.000 £1 ords. and 20,000 £1 121
p.c. prefs.). the same as it was wlien the co.
got to work on its Neath property over 10
years ago. After purchasing new mines and
developing them out of profits, the cash
position has moved this way since 1908: —

Liquid assets . . 5,827 39,605 47,998
So, besides paying good dividends and buying
new properties, • a net liability of £16,478
has been converted into a net surplus of
£43,067. This surplus, however, must not
be regarded wholly as stored-up profits. As
the coal is got out, the value of the mine
diminishes. So the accumulated surplus
liquid assets have to provide for a return of
capital when the properties have been worked
out. After the lesson of 10 years or so ago
the directors are apparently making full
provision for that time.

Great Britain, Emmaville (N.S.W.), pro-
duced 63 tons tin ore for the half-year to
April worth almost £214 per ton, compared
with 62 tons averaging £166 14s. per ton
tor the previous term. The Britain plant,
which sluiced 51,635 cub. yds. for an average
, l-441b. per cub. yd., has now worked out
the wide ground on the main lead and is
operating in one of the two narrow branches
forming the head of the lead. The Y Creek
plant got on to better stuff and treated
53,164 cub. yds. for an average yield of 1.251 b.
per cub. yd., the average for the previous term
having been .881 b. It is estimated that this
plant has a further two years’ work ahead of
it. During the half-year six Is. dividends
were distributed, and since the accounts
were made up a further 4s. per share has
been handed out. Capital is £5OOO in 10,000
fully-paid shares of 10s. each. At the end
of April the co. owed £4257 and liquid assets
totalled £9324. The mine account has been
written down to £450. The directors have
taken an option over 200 acres near Mount
Amos (Q.) and are at present sampling the
property.
Adelong Estates (N.S.W.) is tipped to
run into poorer ground shortly, according to
manager George: but that doesn’t necessarily
mean the end of profitable returns. During
the half-year to April 30 costs worked out at
about 104 oz. weekly for the two plants, and
as each clean-up averaged 2200 z. there was
a working profit of £12,500. It was No. 2
plant that piled up the tally. At no time
was the dredge handling- less than Od. dirt,
and occasionally it was putting through lid.
to 13d. Avash. Compared with that plum-
pudding stuff No. 1 dredge’s average of 5 Ad.
looks poor, but it was payable all the time.
George thinks that costs are at a maximum.
If so, the quarterly shilling won’t be in.
jeopardy so long as the dredges can be kept
rummaging in wash. The co. has now
paid off Monty Cohen, and has a surplus of
liquid assets of £10,500 to tide over bad times
should events falsify manager George’s pre-
diction that even with less gold profitable
returns are to continue.

Ivanhoe (W.A.) made a net profit of
£106,092 last year, and 10s. Od. per share
was returned to shareholders, absorbing
£105,000. Ore reserves are now estimated
at 1,935,874 tons, averaging 345. 2d. per ton.
Deducting 225. 9d. working expenses, 4s. lOd.
loss in residues and Bd. 'for London office
disbursements, in all 2Ss. 3d., there re-
mains a net profit of about ss. lid. per ton,
which on 18.000 tons a month amounts to
upwards of £60,000 a year. With other in-
come the Board considers that the co. will be
able to pay a div. of 6s. 6d. per share yearly
for a considerable time, unless some new
troubles in the way of increased taxation or
further difficulties with labor have to be met.
Ivanhoe has distributed £3,670.000 among
shareholders, and has written off all but
£54,295 of the £1,056.071 expended on
development, plant, etc.

The experience of Black Range Pinna-
cles (W.A.) serves as a sort of warning to
cos. 1 owning busted mines not to hang on
long to any capital that may be left. ' The
Pinnacles shut down and obtained a year’s
exemption some months ago, yet the State
and Federal tax-gatherers collared £1439 of
the undistributed funds, and have now
demanded between them a further £B5l. The
co. is disputing this latter claim, and is
hurriedly trying to sell out before being billed
further. Heavy taxation is inevitable, but
the taxing of a co. out of existence in this
way seems unjustifiable.
To the end of June the 30-odd State bat-
teries in Westralia had crushed a little
under five miHions sterling out of gold and
over £90,000 out of tin ore. The mills, how-
ever, for the want of sufficient custom, have
not paid. Around almost every one of them
are to be seen shows which were abandoned
when the owners were no longer able to go
any deeper without pumping and hadn’t the
cash or backing to buy plant. Many of
these waterlogged shows may be quite as
good in the bottom as they were in the
upper levels, but nobody seems inclined to
furnish the capital to drain them and find
out. Instead of succumbing to political
influence and installing batteries here, there
and everywhere, Governments would have
saved money had they subsidised claim-
holders to develop ore, and so have something
to attract mine-buyers instead of allowing
owners to clean out and crush everything
down to water-level, compel State batteries
to remain idle for about 10 months out of
every year for the want of stone to crush,
and finally leave nothing but a hole full of
water that no one will look at.

Tributors are now getting a look-in on
most of Ivalgoorlie’s big mines. The latest
is the Associated, where portion of the hilly
surface has been thrown open and several
blocks marked out. Oroya Links is now
over-run with tributors, and will soon bear
the same rooted appearance as the adjoining
North Kalgurli and Associated Northern.
Boulder Perseverance is also being prepared
for the same fate. So far no tributes have
been let on Great Boulder, Ivanhoe, Golden
Horseshoe or Lake View, but it is only a
matter of time. The most profitable tribute
on the field, since one party cleared £5OOO
a man out of a rich spot on the old Brown-
hill lease, has been the Associated Northern.
Already over £30,000 worth of gold has been
dug out, and last month’s return gave nearly
£ll,OOO. Of this the co. got approximately
£4OOO in royalty, etc.
Scarcity of efficient labor still prevents
the Greenbushes tin deposits (W.A.) being
extensively worked, and the distant north-
west Wodgina field is in the same predica-
ment. Copper is being mined in a spas-
modic way at Phillips River, and would be
worked on a much bigger scale on the iso-
lated fields beyond Peak Ilill but for trans-
port and other charges making the cost of
production prohibitive. Big veins of cop-
per are also stated to be visible along the
banks of the Ord River, in the North, but
here again the expense of , getting and mar-
keting is too great under present condi-
tions. Several deposits of tin and cop-
per nearer the coast and railway are now
being tried. Beyond patches here and there
on the Yalgoo field very little molybdenite
has so far been unearthed in Westralia, but
a few prospectors, backed by Perth and Kal-
goorlie speculators, are out testing likely
places.

The Wealth of Nations is one of the old-
time Westralian mines which is reckoned
in some quarters to be worth looking over
again. This is the show where John Dunn
made his sensational find in the first
days of Coolgardie. After discoveries on
the Murchison and at Mt. Margaret in
1893, he had a look at likely country
between 30 to 40 miles north-west of
Coolgardie. His first find was a patch
of 400 oz. of alluvial gold. Then lie
came across the Wealth of Nations.
Breaking the cap of the reef, which was
sft. high and Oft. thick, he obtained, besides
a lot of other gold, the "Honest John” speci-
men, weighing 1801 b. and containing BQooz.
of gold, valued at £3OOO. This was per-
haps one of the most brilliant quartz speci-
mens found in Australia. A tremendous
rush, headed by Smiler Hales on a brumby,
took place to the locality, and in a few
days nearly a thousand men were on the
ground. Dunn, who got a third of the
£22,000 worth of gold lodged in the bank,
sold his share in the mine for £20.000. The
other members of the syndicate disposed of
theirs six months later for £150.000. and
the show was then floated in London. By
that time, however, nearly all the gold
had been taken out, and the co. soon gave
up.
* * * *
One of Dyason’s bad disappointments at
Bendigo was George LanselFs old favorite,
the Virginia. Calls were paid for a decade
before Lansell got any reward. Prior to
the advent of Dyason’s co. profits came
from beating out the saddle of the
centre reef at about 1900 ft. As the show
was becoming a drag Dyason threw it open
to tributors, and hardly a party in the mine
has failed to do well. They quickly ascer-
tained that the gold made where cross spurs
cut into the legs of the saddles, and by pick-
ing out blocks containing these occurrences
they have been getting splendid yields. Opie
and Ralph have been the luckiest crowd.
Their rich shoot is only about Oft. long by
18in. wide, but it is a bonanza, working out
up to 540 z. per ton. As other parties are
doing well, the co. is going to try its luck
beyond the tribute blocks, as well as having
a shot at developing the spurs on the Mac-
duff formation at 3250 ft. and those east at
608 ft.

Cathcart Victory is the only show plucky
enough to tackle shallow alluvial at Ararat
(Vic.). Its first try on the Hopkins lead
cut no ice. Now it is dodging into the Vic-
tory gutter at a point below its junction with
the Hopkins and Spring Gully systems.
These tributaries were payable in their far
upper reaches; but there is not much in
Alec Dow’s Cathcart Victory work either up
or down the gutter to show that he has
any of the old bonanza stuff at his disposal.

Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) made a profit on
working account of £67,550 for the six
months to February 28. After deducting
office charges and setting aside £7145 for
income tax there was a net profit of
£50,934. Of this £11,665 goes into deprecia-
tion reserve, £15,000 towards new plant, and
after including the £5B brought in from the
previous term the carry-forward amounts to
£24,327. On the question of dividends the
directors say:—
It must be understood that the eo.’s product
(blister copper) is not deliverable under existing
contracts until it is refined. The financing of this
large tonnage of blister, and the increased amount
required to maintain stocks of stores, coke, etc.,
combined with the heavy capital expenditure
involved in the completion of the Trekelano tramway
and the equipment of that mine, have influenced the
policy of the Board in respect to dividend distribu-
tions.
The co. is leaning on the bank to the extent
of £119,132, it holds £57,413 of deposits and
owes sundry creditors £32,859. Add income-
tax .provision, and liabilities total £229,407.
On the other side products on hand and in
transit are valued at £278,380, stores, etc.,
at £126,308, and cash items amount to
£11.731; total, £416,419. The surplus of
liquid assets over liabilities is thus £157,012.
During: the six months the smelter put
through 49,065 tons ore for 3262 tons blister
containing 3204 tons tine copper, 12020 z.
gold and 21,8530 z. silver. The total ore raised
in the term was 40,556 tons, the chief pro-
ducers being: Hampden mines, 10,016 tons ;
Duchess. 12.083 tons; Salmon and Dingo,
11,375 tons; and MacGregor-Wallaroo, 5411
tons. General-manager Erie Huntley esti-
mates ore reserves at 266,500 tons containing
17,300 tons copper.

Mungana Copper. Chillagoe (Q.), share-
holders are being called together in Mel-
bourne on the 15th inst. to discuss winding
up. The co. was dependent on the Chillagoe
Co.’s smelters, and when they closed down
in March, 1915, Mungana, having no other
market for its ore, had also to cease opera-
tions. The directors have been holding on in
the hope that Chillagoe|would resume when
the development of the Mount Mulligan coal
deposits promised hope of reducing smelting
costs. However, Chillagoe shows no signs of
re-starting, and Mungana, wearied of main-
taining its plant, decided to allow the leases
to lapse and sell off. Some of the ground
forfeited has already been taken up, and tile
present leaseholders have been granted State
aid.
Cloncurry (Q.) cos. smelted 17,966 tons
of ore in April for a return of 1131 tons
blister copper, containing 31450 z. gold and
23270 z. of silver. During the month 3907
tons of limestone and 1330 tons of ironstone
were used, costing £4277; so, roughly, the
cost of fluxes amounted to £3 15s. per ton
of copper. Much of the limestone used con-
tains from h p.c. to 1 p.c. copper, and the
Hampden co. sometimes obtains 17 tons of
copper out of its limestone fluxes. Average
extraction from the three smelteries in April
was 6.29 p.c. copper.
A Melbourne syndicate is starting a bore-
hole on the big zinc lode at Ban Ban, 19
miles out of Biggenden. in the Burnett dis-
trict (Q.). State Geologist Dunstan had a
look over the lode in 1.916 and after trench-
ing to a depth of 12ft. exposed a width of
45ft. of solid sulphide ore. He reported that
“the ore is made up of iron pyrites and zinc
blendes, with mere traces of galena, the two
former being distinct from one another and
no doubt would be easily separated b.v
mechanical means.” A general sample
yielded 12.4 p.c. zinc and 13dwt. silver on
assay.

Mt. Morgan Extension (Q.) has a scheme
on hand to raise £5OOO to continue mining
and prospecting the block adjoining its
wealthy neighbor. It is proposed to issue

Treasurer’s sanction is conditional on the
issue being subscribed by the present share-
holders. Most of the shares are held by
men who made their monev at Charters
Towers.

Mt. Elliott (Q.), having recovered from
its latest labor trouble, has warmed up its
furnace again. The return for May was
390 tons of copper valued roughly at £39,000
from 7913 tons of ore, an average of about
90s. per ton. Some good ore is at present
being raised from No. 3 level.

North Tasmania Copper is distributing

it down.

The use of charcoal dust as a precipitant
for gold from cyanide solutions, in place of
the much more expensive zinc dust, is an
Australian development that is apparently
going to spread. H. R. Edmunds, who in
conjunction with K. Byron Moore installed
it at the Riverina South (W.A.), has gone
to a Rhodesian show, where it is understood
he will install a similar plant.

ment of machinery. Metal Manufactures.

‘•Quidnunc”: To “Brown Coalite” (B.
27/6/T8) I would say that whereas Mor-
well is 90 miles from Melbourne, Kiewa is
twice, the distance. Certainly it is not a
question of Kiewa versus brown coal. The
issue raised by Harper and Herman was:
Why not turn the brown coal to account by
providing fuel for domestic and factory use,
as well as for tli? generation of cheap power?
After all, the big users of the 1,000,000 tons
of coal sent yearly into Victoria are the
house and the manufactory. Where Minis-
ter Livingston failed was that he hadn’t the
courage to spend the cash necessary to send
a top-notcher to the United States or Europe
to not only pick up the very latest about
the cheap generation of power but to get
the first unit of a briquetting plant. Mines
Minister Barnes, being a practical miner,
sees this and realises that the high per
centage of tines at the Morwell open cut
niust be used to bring costs down. Pulver-
ising is one solution; briquetting is another;
and gasifying is a third. With black coal at
41s. per ton to the housewife the briquette
is a necessity. Saxony turns out 25 million
tons of briquettes annually. The clay capping
at Morwell handled by mechanical devices
isn’t a bugbear if modern appliances are
used, as in Germany. Just as with Kiewa, no
one has even said a bad word against the
Hobson Bay-Werribee seam. The difference
between it and Morwell lies in the fact that
the overburden is a thick run of basalt ren-
dering open-cut work impossible. If the cost
of getting this coal is only ss. 6d. per ton,
how is it that the big shaft at Altona, at
Melbourne’s front door, does not put Mor-
nvell right out of the picture? Anyway, Pre-
mier Lawson adopts the State control plank
in respect to brown coal, and he intends to
get a hustle on at Morwell to secure the
cheap, power Melbourne wants.

Riehmondj Mallett Street, Camperdown,
UW’IS
A* one who has proved the sterling worth of Clements Tonic, I recommend
it gratefully.
About eight years ago I underwent a serious operation, with the result that
ever since I have suffered from nervous headaches, which medicines, poultices, lini-
ments and ointments failed to cure.
I had tried every remedy possible, and when Clements Tonic ivas suggested I
consented ; and now I can conscientiously slate that after taking it I have been
entirely free from any head pains; in fact, I feel 10 years younger and fit for
another score of years of hard work.
I shall always be pleased to confirm this statement to anyone calling on me.
and I am well known, as I have been in Sydney
over fo years and in business on my own
account for many years.

It is as good for women as for men.

Frank Wilson, ex-Preuiier of Westralia. is
making a slow but satisfactory recovery from
an operation he underwent at Sydney at the
beginning of May. He is returning to the
West by easy stages, taking rests at Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Port Augusta.
Lon Reynolds, whose caricatures from the
Speck have appeared in The Bulletin,
went into Claremont camp the other day en
route to the European conflict. He* has just
turned 21, and was an architectural drafts-
man in the Tasmanian Public Works Depart-
ment.
CHARLIE
McDONALD,
M.H.R., ex-Speaker
of Fed. House of
Reps.
Dead in Adelaide, very suddenly, Jasper
Bee, formerly a leading accountant in the
Public Service, and at one time president of
the P.S. Association. He was 71 at the eud.
Since retiring from office-work he had been
putting in strenuous labor on an orchard in
the hills, and apparently the strain proved
too much for his heart.
V;.
Tim O’Connor, brother of the famous Dan.
is the “father” of the retail butchering
trade in Sydney. He arrived in ISoo
with his parents and two brothers (Patsey
was the other). The father was a butcher
from the Cold Country, and Dan and Tim
followed the trade. Patsey had an agency
and also did a little newspaper work. Dan, of
course, took to politics, and became the
most picturesque postmaster-general of his
time. Tim is the survivor of the three. For
03 years he has been in with the meat busi-
ness.
Andrew JR. Johnstone, who laid down the
hammer last week with a record of some-
thing like 40 years to look back upon, was
a salesman at the old saleyards situated at
an ancient hostelry at Homebush (N.S.W.),
known then and now as The Horse and
Jockey. His last sale was conducted for
Winchcombe, Carson, Limited. There was
a strange coincidence on the day. The first
lot of sheep sold by Andrew Johnstone at
the old Horse and Jockey yards, 39 years
ago, was knocked down to the late Thomas
Elliott, while the last lot upon which the
auctioneer’s hammer fell was to Wrn. Elliott,
a son of the said Thomas.
Waller Gibson, engineer, just home to
Melbourne from German prisons, was in
Aberbach, near Heidelberg, for health reasons
in Nov., 1914. when he was interned. Fritz,
recognising that the Australian was unfit
for military service, not long ago released
him, but he wasn’t so incapacitated that he
couldn’t work his passage home from England
PARTICULAR.
"Terrible wowser, isn’t she?”
"Yes; she wouldn’t accompany a man on the
piano without a chaperon!"
when lie was otherwise unable to get a
passage. A number of prisoners where Gib-
son was interned went mad, clue to the strain
and general ill-treatment. He refutes the
report that the Hun was boiling-down bodies
of dead soldiers to obtain fat. Carcases, not
corpses, were so treated, he explains. Those
who are deceiving themselves with the expec-
tation that internal discontent in Germany
will win the war for us get cold comfort
from the man who has just come from there.
Inspector George Brown, of N. S. Wales
Police, leaves the beat on pension after 35
years of it. When in the detective branch
long ago he helped to drag Butler, the Blue
Mountain murderer, to the gallows. As the
result of a photograph that Brown.got hold
of Butler was recognised when he left New-
castle on board the Swanhilda. The rest,
including the send-off, was easy.
“F.”: Apropos Charles Summers (B.
27/6/T8). The sculptor-stonemason had a
brainy brother who settled in Melbourne—
Joseph Summers, Mus. Bac. Oxon., who in
early life was a chorister in Wells Cathe-
dral. He came to Melbourne in 1865, and
was choirmaster and organist at St.
Peter‘s_ Anglican Church, Eastern Hill.
In 1876 he was appointed Inspector of
Music for State Schools. Charles Summers,
on the occasion of the Tercentenary of
Shakspeare’s birth, made a cast in plaster
for a statue of Shakspeare. This was un-
veiled with much ceremony in front of the
Library in Melbourne, where now is
the effigy of Redmond Barry. The amount
needed for the statue was not subscribed, so
the plaster was made into something useful.
The death at Sydney of Mrs. Annie Creel*,
wkLw of the late Joseph opens the
door of memory. Creer was 83 when he
went out. tie was a Manxman who came
to Australia and settled for a time at Mait-
land (N.S.W.). From there he went to
Newcastle, where he carried on an auction-
eering business. For some years he held
down the Northumberland seat in the
Assembly. During a long spell of unemploy-
ment George Dibbs commissioned him _to
start a State Labor Bureau, and he carried
it on while Dibbs lasted as Premier. Later,
the “burreo” was kept on in modified form
under another ex-M.L.A., W. F. Schey.
Adelaide Register the other day recalled
the admittance to the Bar of Charles Burton
Hardy. lie is one of the very few to chase
Costs continuously for half a century. Per-
haps it would be more correct to say that
they have chased him, for it is his boast that
he has for the last 47 years sat in the same
chair, at the same table, in the same room.
He was always more of a family-lawyer than
an advocate. Chief Justice Cooper was his
uncle. The old name of Fenn and Hardy
still remains on the brass plate. Cleland,
K.C., was in the firm at one time, and the
present junior members are Burton Hardy-,
now at Front, and Blackburn, who has
brought a V.C. back with him from the same
address.
Ryan, Essendon’s “Nationalist” member in
the Vie. Assembly, has come to the conclu-
sion that lie can be of more service in khaki
than politics. He will go abroad as a
reinforcement in the Railway Unit.
The death of Denny Day, well known in
banking and commercial circles in Queensland
bushranging
incident of nearly 80 years ago.
Day was son of the police-magis-
trate at Maitland, who in 1841
distinguished himself as the leader
of a party which, after a pitched
battle, captured the “Jew Boy’s”
gang at Doughboy Hollow’. The
batch was tried in Sydney, found
guilty, and the lot (six) were dili-
gently hanged in the gaol yard in
Lower George-street. Great efforts
were made to save the leader,
Edward Davis, who was “well con-
nected.” He was better connected
at the finish.
Emma Caroline Palmer, who
went to the long sleep in her 85th
year in Sydney the other day, was
the widow of Benjamin Palmer,
who was Mayor of Sydney
187">-76. She was the mother of
the late wufe of Richard Teece, of
the A.M.P. Society. The Palmers
were a family of hotelkeepers.
In 1850 Benjamin kept the Swan
with Two Necks (the corruption
of Swan with Two Nicks, known in
London liquor history), and after-
wards the Liverpool Arms, on the south-
west corner of King and Pitt streets,
Sydney.
Mazzini Tron, a Westralian parson who
got the Military Cross as chaplain in France
last year, collected two more decorations
the other day—a D.S.O. and a wound-stripe.
Before the war Tron was a member of the
Anglican Brotherhood of St. Boniface,
stationed at Dwellingup. Now he belongs
to the Brotherhood of St. Billiim the Cru-
sader.
"Chudah”: Monash was educated at Mel-
bourne Scotch College. He matriculated in
IS I 9, when only 14 years old; dux two years
later. _ As a civil engineer he had a high
standing in Melbourne. He was an early
authority on reinforced concrete, and secre-
tary of the Monier Concrete Construction
Company. On four occasions he was presi-
dent of the Victorian Engineers’ Institute,
and is a member of the London Engineers’
Institute. But his bias was military. He
joined the Victorian forces as lieutenant in
1887. advanced to lieutenant-colonel in
190 S (commanding the Intelligence Corps),
aud went to the war in December, 1914, as
Brigadier-(1 eneral. He was concerned in the
operations at Anzac, Courtney’s Post. Pope’s
Hill, the Neck. Walker’s Ridge, Table Top.
The Apex, Lone Pine, Suez Canal. Armen-
tieres, Messines. Ypres, etc. He has a
Napoleonic-looking head, with the addition
of a moustache.
The N. S. Wales Courts presided over by
Judge Hey don are not lucky places for labor-
union representatives to have business in.
Miller, Hampton and “Dihny” Gulhen died
while his Honor sat in Arbitration, and he
had no sooner taken on the Presidentship of
the new Board of Trade than A. E. Dengate
followed them. Dengate was organiser for
the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and
was right in the troubles of the big strike
last year. He was only 40, and too useful
to be lost.
‘‘Wart”: Passed out at George Town
(Tas.), aged 82, Samuel Richards, who was
connected with mining in Victoria and the
Speck all his life. He was on the Victoria
diggings in the early’fifties, and on his return
to Tassy discovered the Lefroy field, for
which be received the Government grant.
He lived long enough to see the field practi-
cally deserted. Samuel had no family of his
own. but he brought up his. brother's son.
Surgeon-Major Sam Richards, who was-killed
at Gallipoli.
CHEERFUL OUTLOOK.
“You’re sure to moke good."
“Oh, come! I sag! ice mustn’t he too preci-
ous, y’ know."
“Nonsense. I can see your name on the
Honor Roll already."
After representing Gravesend for 18'years,
Gilbert Parker, once of the S. M. Herald,
has resigned, owing to illness. As a Parlia-
mentarian Parker was painstaking and well-
informed ; yet, on the authority' of Henry
Lucy, he was one of the Commons’ most
distinguished bores.
Hugh Garland, of Adelaide Register,
wrote some good war sketches when at home
last year, before his last and fatal visit to the
firing-line. These have been collected with
his verses (some of which appeared in
the “Anzac Book”), and photographs of
him or taken by him ; and the whole makes
a suitable memorial. It sold by thou-
sands in the streets of Adelaide at the Violet
Day celebration last week.
"The Oldest Inhabitant” expounds:—
Apropos the lady practical gardener (B. 27/6/’18),
Mrs. “Rolf Boldrewood,” one of the Rileys, of Rally,
was an enthusiastic horticulturist. She learned the
art at the old home of her grandfather, Captain
Brooks, of Denham Court, where she lived with her
uncle, Captain Bloomfield. At the mature age of
eight years she went to Miss Moore’s school at Bella
Rcti.ro, near Sydney, where her fancy for gardening
was developed. As she grew older she was a wel-
come visitor at T. S. Mort’s gardens at Green Oakes.
On holidays, as a treat, her cousin, Mrs. Robert
Campbell (also a Riley of Rabv), was in the
habit of taking her to Guilfoyle’s nursery at Double
Bay. The last garden she had was at the home o’
her cousin, James Riley, at Glenmore. After mar-
riage she had so many removals from place to place
that a permanent garden was impossible. In 1893
Mrs. Browne published through Mulfens, of Mel-
bourne, a volume entitled “The Flower Garden in
Australia,” which she dedicated to Lady Jersey. It
is of 144 pages and treats of 337 plants and shrubs.
THE CONQUEST OF WINTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The curse of Moses on these winter days,
Grim biting nights and misty lifeless morns.
The happy spirit in my waistcoat scorns
A world that sulks in gloom and never plays.
Who first invented winter in the maze
Of the lost ages, let him bear the mark,
Thrice branded, of old Cain. The Primal Nark
Deserves a frozen hell, sans light, sans blaze.
The world was upright as all worlds should be,
Spinning an even course between its poles.
Without tiie use of blankets, coats or coals,
Our mild race lived beside a milder sea.
All fruits were there for breakfast, lunch or tea.
Sneezes were quite unknown, and from the ills
Of influenza and rheumatic chills
The smiling - world was absolutely free.
Then came the Titan Nark, and pushed askew
The cosmos in perpetual glad#ess clad.
Tiie cold crept in and half the race went mad
l u the sharp grip of pangs it never knew.
Uncertain where to go or what to do,
Some tore the skins from sheep and seals and
bears,
Some iu secluded corners made their lairs,
Some climbed volcanoes with desire to stew.
ITow to get warm was then the single thought,
The thought from which all other trouble came.
Sonic took to war, and at the gory game,
To keep their circulation moving, fought.
Others, in mad experimenting, wrought
Strange liquors that might tire the freezing blood;
And, in the face of winter frost and flood,
The primal whisky at their fancy caught.
Things straightened out. But never came again
The happy days of warm and perfect, case,
' Cold icebergs floated from the Polar seas,
And all the world was lashed with bitter rain.
Men crowded into city streets- in vain,
Beared their high roofs and paid in minted gold
A constant tribute to keep out the cold
That always gave them chilblains on the brain.
Where is the Primal Nark that wrought this thing?
Let all wars cease until we beat the knave.
Ho!. Marshal all the legions of the brave!
’! here is one work to do, one song to sing—
M e 11 move her while she yet is on the wing!
Australia down below, Europe above,
All hands together! Ease her up. Now, shove!
Push the old earth into perpetual spring !

A POINT IN THEIR FAVOR.
NELL : “Why do you like sailors best?”
JILL: “They go barefooted aboard ship, so
you don’t helve to he always knitting
socks for them.”
The chivalrous Hun got in some fine work
hist week, when the Wimmera, bound from
Auckland to Sydney, surged against a mine.
Apparently this was one of the implements
sprinkled about the MX. coast by the raider
Wolf, which appears to have spent a few
happy weeks thereabouts before adjourning
to annex the Matunga. It; is Useless to ask
what possible military or naval advantage
it could give the German to drop instruments
of sudden death in the pathway of passen-
ger vessels in this part of the world. There
is no advantage in such work. It is just
plain murder. A happening such as this
brings actual war no closer to Australia,
but it throws a fairly bright light on the
character of the enemy who is struggling to
get closer and resume being a neighbor. The
victims of the disaster, fellow citizens of
Australians, have been butchered in cold
blood by German hands, and by the grace of
Providence and the help of Australia’s man-
hood the German shall atone for the crime.
Of 158 people who were aboard the vessel
25 are missing.
The Wimmera, was the third of the Hud-
dart Parker lieet to take the knock in the
vicinity of the top of Maoriland. The
other two were the Elingamite, which hit
one of the Kings a little to the nor’ard of
where the Wimmera stopped ; and the Tas-
mania, wrecked at Mahia. There was a
death-roll of 45 after the Elingamite went
down and of 10 at Mahia. The most calam-
ilous happening at sea over yonder, measured
in terms of lives lost, was the stranding of
the British warship Orpheus on Manakau
bar in Davy .Tones gathered in 181
that day. Eighteen years later, when the
Tarnrua climbed on to Waipapa Point, he
got 131, and in ’94 the Wairarapa, over-
running the Moko Ilinou light, and banging
full-steam abend into the Great Barrier,
gave him 135. Nine years ago there Avas a
tally of 75 in Cook Strait. Poking about
in the wrong place looking for a gleam from
Pincarrow the Penguin, full of passengers
from Pieton to Wellington, was ripped open
like a sardine-tin on the foul ground near
Terawhiti, and the rest happened as swiftly
as if she had been torpedoed. Only one
woman reached the shore that night. She
brought a dead baby Avith her. Some rab-
biters coming doAvn to the beach from their
camp on the nearby hills in the grey dawn
found her beneath an upturned boat, the
body of the child tied to one of the thwarts.

William Webster, P.M.G., again:—
I note the paragraph in your last issue, regard-
ing the refusal to send the wire containing offensive
words. Your reference to Sir Henry Parkes is a
mere quibble, as the wire was intended to convey
what 1 implied to the receiver. As regards your
footnote on truth, you lie when you say I have been
responsible for the loss of mailbags, as is shoAvn
by the published authentic report by officers of both
the;’ Railway and Postal Departments. Hence your
anxiety for my veracity is misplaced, seeing that
same is so badly needed at home.
All of which comes to this. The Bulletin
is not alloAved to suggest over Webster’s tele-
graph lines that a man may be a liar, but
Webster, P.M.G., can call a man a liar
direct on his official notepaper, and despatch
it through his post office. It is somewhat
confusing.

The trouble in “David Copperfield” about
King Charles’s head was nothing in .compari-
son to the envenomed discussion that crops
ftp periodically in Bananaland about Griffin’s
head. Griffin, the old-time Gold Commis-
sioner and P.M. who murdered two con-
stables of the Clermont gold-escort and was
subsequently hanged for the crime, was buried
in a Rockhampton cemetery, A local medico
unearthed the corpse, removed the head,
dried and peeled it and kept it as an orna-
ment of his study for many years. A touch
of the extra gruesome was added to this
resurrection by the fact that the excavators
found a defunct Chow in his. coffin resting
peacefully above Griffin's box. He had
arrived opportunely, and was dropped into
the open allotment to save time and unneces-
sary frill.

“0.L.” : John Langley, Anglican Bishop of
Bendigo (Vie.), has once more been begging
Synod to look into the relations between the
Church and the wage-earner. He has asked
his brother-parsons to try and “more intelli-
gently understand the principles of trades-
unionism” and to seek some remedy for “the
ever-widening breach that exists between the
Church and the great majority of the wage-
earners of the community.” As a rule, the
Anglican parson knows no more of Aus-
tralia’s political windings than a sheep; but
discussion can lead the Church nowhere so
long as the fact remains that the Rev.
Teaspoon devotes, most of his personal atten-
tion to the glossiest birds of his flock, and
occasionally patronises the barnyard variety.

On the eve of the Evacuation :
I walked from the 'right to the left sector of our
line, four miles over rough and difficult country.
The hills and valleys,' each with its special name
and significance, at normal times literally teeming
with life, were deserted in appearance, and this,
combined rvith a certain uncany stillness in the air,
gave one a feeling of foreboding. Passing by a
small cemetery I paused to look at the graves and
read the names and inscriptions on the little white
crosses. These death camps had been well tended
by the boys, and their care was manifested. It
FRAGILE.
“Not so loud, hoy! Why don't you drop your voice a hit token speaking?"
“It breaks if I do, sir!”
was winter. A little robin-redbreast was hopping
about from one cross to another. Each small, but
iftonumetal, memorial placed by the fallen man’s
comrade stood as a symbol of the sacrifice that had
been made. It was the greatest symbol that
brother could erect to brother. Death! These men
were buried on Anzac! What were the feelings of
those who were leaving behind on the coming night
some very dear friend in the care of an enemy,
however brave. Alas! the Australians whose love
of liberty led them to embark upon unknown perils
and dangers. They had left home full of the joy
of life, a splendid product of a free land, unheckled
with the conventions and prejudices of an older
world. Is this to be the end of their crusade? Is
all that sacrifice in vain? I know Australia better
than to think it.
SUSPICIOUS.
“I'm afraid, dear, George doesn't love me
71010.”
“What makes yon think so?”
“Well, token ice quarrel lie makes it up
straight away.”
“Bad Australian’s” old friends:—
I have met my countrymen in a good many parts
of the world, and they have mostly been good Aus-
tralians right through—in some cases aggressively so.
Down here in S: America I have seen the Australian
on the beach from Guayaquil to Punta Arenas;
punching down from Puget Sound in a Yankee wind-
jammer to Valparaiso and around the Horn to
Buenos Aires; sundowning across the Andes; run-
ning mines and mule transport in Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia and Chile; controlling freezing works and
canning beef and mutton in Argentina; managing
dredgers, lumber mills and sugar outfits in Brazil
and Paraguay; handling big shipping business on
the Pacific Coast; railroading all over the continent
and at times hobnobbing with Presidents and ban-
dits ; always with a. proper pride in his homeland
openly expressed in the face of all men, though many
of him has had little to -thank Australia for from a
materialistic point of view. The exiled Australian
throughout S. America is invariably spoken of as the
“‘Australia no,” while the rest of the family comes
under the general term “Inglese,” which seems to
show that he has made the position fairly clear in
Latin America, and 1 have no reason to believe that
he has failed to make it equally clear elsewhere.

“Assistant Billjim” : A sergeant-major was
giving ns a pretty ,forty time after a route
march through the city. “You’re not sol-
dier’s bootlaces,” he said ; “in fact, I can't
find words to express my disgust at yon.”
“That’s the worst of being a poor ignorant
says the bloke behind me.
According to a cable message published in
Sydney newspapers last week a person
named Joseph Rutherford, boss of the
“International Bible Students’ Associa-
tion, ’ and six assistants had been sentenced
to 20 years’ residence in the cooler for con-
spiring to violate the United States’ . pion-
age law. It looks a vague sort of a charge,
but the 20 years is sufficiently definite to
suggest that Rutherford and co. had been
doing something fairly serious in the way of
interrupting Uncle Sam’s argument across
the Atlantic, Meantime The - Bulletin has
been wondering whether Rutherford’s pro-
longed retirement will interfere with the
Australian end of liis business. Only the
other day a kind-faced citizen armed with a
bag handed this paper a copy of a disordered
looking publication called the Bible
Students’ Monthly. Heaven knows what

NON COMPRENEZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“We were forced to retire through overwhelming
numbers.” ‘ °
Limping down the sunset road
Looking westward on the wheat,
Piled in many a golden load,
France seems sticking to my feet.
Overhead the yellow moon
Gives a friendly little nod
As she did that scarlet June
When we marched in line with God.
I can see the miles we made
All the weary, bleeding way;
When a man would wish a spade
Nearer than ids battle pay.
Voices break amid the trees.
Sleepy birds the evening leave
To the little errant breeze
Playing with my empty sleeve.
Poor old pal I left out there,
Loose and broken like the shell—
Arms so strong were built to share
In a fight of Heaven and Hell!
Step and fall and step and fall,
Limping to the sunset vale;
But above the cricket’s call
I can hear a tired wail. /
Dumbly crying comes the sound,
Beating anguish to my brain—
Brother voices from the ground ;
Arms that will not strike again;
French and English moaning woe
Where the feet of war have gone....
“Non comprcnez/’ dull arid low ;
“Non comprenez/’ till the dawn.
Limping through the gates of- night,
Tears of pain within my soul,
Westward gleaming, light on light,
Quiet stars above me 'roll.
Dear old playmate making dust
For the felon feet to pass,
Honor has your heart (in trust
Breathing freedom from her grass!

Four Grain Silos, 85 feet high, 25 feet diameter, at Wagga, for the Murrumbidgee Milling Co.
The walls of these 4 great Silos are only 7 inches thick.
Australia’s problem to-day is the preservation of wheat until
shipping becomes available.
Reinforced Concrete provides the cheapest, strongest, most
durable and fireproof structure that can be built for this
purpose. Reduces insurance to a minimum.
In buildings required for any other purpose, reinforced con-
crete has outstanding advantages which save money. We
shall be glad to discuss any building proposition with you
or with your architect or engineer.
Our indented Steel Re inforcing Bars, rolled in Australia by G. $ C. Hoskins Ltd., are used
in all the Government Wheat Silos in N.S.W.

One of the horrors of defensive war—the
war that defends Australia only when the
enemy comes here, instead of doing the job
m Flanders—is that people are driven to
'destroy their own cities. The retreating
French and Belgians carried away every-
thing they could carry. The advancing
Huns took the rest. They bombarded
the cities to drive the Allies out. The
Allies had to bombard as they retreated to
check the pursuit. Day after day the French
and Belgians rain bombs on their own lost
towns to hustle the new Hun occupants: in
lact the lost town in the Debatable Land is
everybody’s target and anybody’s dog. War
abroad is purgatory. War at home, war
when the defence is at our own door, is
Shool heated seven times with compound
interest thrown in.
“Form Fours”: A few days ago a party
of men from the infantry guard of returned
Anzacs at Point Nepean (Vic.), while off
duty, were trailing a wallaby through the
dense scrub near the Quarantine Station
when they discovered a “plant” of nine full
quart bottles of whisky—a relic of the
wreck of the Sierra Nevada, which occurred
near there 18 years ago. The ship’s cargo
consisted of whisky, and the back beach was
strewn with barrels and cases. Then began
a weird orgy among the residents. Thousands
of bottles, dozens of cases and barrels were
collected and either buried among the sand
dunes or planted in the dense scrub, despite
the soldiers who were placed on guard.
Unfortunately, the ever-shifting sand
and the almost -impenetrable scrub have
obliterated all traces of hundreds of the
plants. Occasionally, however, one is un-
earthed. whereupon there is great joy in the
locality, and the sounds of revelry rebound
from the rim of Paradise.

“Devonia”: I can heartily endorse the re-
marks by “Padjud” (B. 26/5/T8) and other
correspondents that the correspondence col-
leges require Government inspection and
supervision. I wanted to learn “journalism,”
and wrote to two Sydney Colleges for in-
formation. The first replied that they had
no such course, but advised me to apply to
a member of a certain newspaper staff. The
second show sent a synopsis of a course —GO
lessons for £l2 12s. It looked all right, and
I enrolled, but got only 42 lessons instead of
GO. No text-books used, merely typed lessons
so indistinct that some could not be read.
But here’s the point. A few months after
my course began I got a letter saying that if
I would send the names of three people who
SWEET NOTHINGS.
“Have you any idea how short that skirt, is?"
"Yes, and I’ve a fair idea of how long it
will he before you get me another one.”
would take lessons they would give me a
certificate of proficiency in any subject' The
whole course as advertised was a three-years’
one, and 1 had not completed the first year
when that amazing letter came.
USEFUL.
“I won the prize at the cooking competition

“Arthur R.”: The secret society that
“Quidam” (B. 20/G/T8) mentions, is not
only confined to tramps, but is shared by
hawkers, thieves, burglars and impostors
generally. In Australia this freemasonry
is very com m o n
among the tramps,
who have reduced it
to a fine art. I have
seen a tramp care-
fully examine a tele-
graph- or a gate-post
before entering a
house, but on inspect-
ing the post later I
could not find any-
thing at all sus-
picious. Hawkers,
even when they have
never before been in
the street, know the
good and the bad
places for trade, and,
as a rule, the old
hand will never touch
the latter. In a street
that w%s recently
visited by burglars,
marks of guidance
were found chalked
on all the houses
touched, showing that
a system of cabalis-
tic signs was in- use.
To all appearances
the signs were merely
rough drawings done
by children; but in
reading them in con-
junction, after the
burglaries, it was
possible to gather the
sense of many of the
mysterious hie r o-
glyphics, the mean-
ings of which varied
from “Savage dog in yard” to “Electric
alarms fitted throughout.”
■* * * *
“Form Fours”: Two oaken casks that
were sunk in the sand on the Sorrento beach
by Colonel Collins in 1803 to obtain a supply
of fresh water for his settlement were found
some months ago near “The Sisters,” two
points of land to the east of the town. This
spot is the scene of the first attempt at
settlement in Victoria, and should be set
aside as a National Park, but instead a mere
strip of land leading up to some later settlers’
graves has been reserved. The reservation
does not cover one acre and does not include
the actual site of the original settlement.
That has been grabbed by selfish bunga-
low-builders who have fenced it off right
down to the water’s edge and put up the
usual Hunnish notice that trespassers will
be prosecuted. A great deal of the foreshore
has been alienated in a similar manner, and
barbed-wire entanglements fixed right down
to the sea. Whenever I see wire now I
want to turn the guns on it. and get at the
people who put it up.
“Eye-Witness” : In a remote corner of the
Speck the scattered residents recently
arranged a welcome home for two of their
returned Billjims. For genuine heartiness
it knocked any other show I have been at.
On the night chosen to lionise the boys the
heavens burst; but the dripping Salvation
Army band assembled in full force in the
storm and, having collected the guests of the
evening at their respective homes, together
with their soaked relatives, they formed
a procession and splashed off down a cross-
country track to the tune of “Tipperary.”
The rain made the trombone splutter and
put some of the lanterns out, but didn’t
damp the enthusiasm. Arriving at the small
weatherboard school-house, which was
almost full to overflowing already, they
were welcomed on the step by the oldest
inhabitant, who conducted the two dripping
and self-conscious heroes to the place of
honor on the platform. Seated as close
together as they could conveniently get on
a rickety form they tried real hard to look
as if they were a thousand miles away
while the neighbors clapped and cheered.
The Australian flag disguised a multiplica-
tion sum on the blackboard, and gum-
leaves hung from the rafters, which were
shaken when a girl pinned a medal on each
of the boys. Supper was handed around
and afterwards they descended from the
platform by request and after a good lot of
persuasion related a few of their experi-
ences. “Glad to be back? Rath-er —what do
you think?” I met them both next day leaning
against the fence in one of the paddocks,
and they shyly confided they had not felt
half as nervous w r hen the shrapnel was fly-
ing as they had at the blanky welcome.
“But it was a real tip-top evenin’!”

“Marco Buzz”: According to a stewardess
of the Matunga the wireless operator was
asleep in bed when the Wolf first showed
her teeth. That is the explanation given as
to why the merchant vessel sent out no dis-
tress signals. It’s unconvincing to anyone
who knows. The wireless cabin on the
Matunga was right on the bridge, and the
average dot-dash merchant sleeps pretty
light right alongside his instruments, so its
only a matter of seconds to throw over the
starting handle and get away a call. In all
probability what happened was that the
Wolf said: “Use your wireless and 1 will
sink you,” or some such warning. In the
case of any sensational happenings at sea
the ravenous public is filled lip with the
vegetable cook’s narrative or that of the
17th spud-peeler. The officers won’t talk.
I’ll wager that the Sparks of the Matunga
was up and ready to broadcast his S.O.S. call
within seconds of the challenge.

CONCERNING BROWN AND SUNDRIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There's little news to write about this week:
1 vainly look around or gaze afar,
And, being short of matter, so to speak,
i naturally grab the old guitar,
And chant in measured strain a rhyme jejune
That cares for nothing, save to keep in tune.
My old friend Brown has ridden in a hearse,
The first and only time since, he was born ;
He made a change for better or for worse.
I liked old Brown, but have no time to mourn,
Perhaps he was not worth six lines of space,
But I, hard up for news, just state the case.
Fresh income taxes, owing to the war.
Will soon befall us—-so saith Willy Watt.
The pressman smiles ; the squatter's soul is sore.
I pay a little; he must pay a lot.
Gaily I muse on millionaires and such,
And thank the Lord my income isn't much.
’Tis love, they say, that makes the world go round.
Food, work and sleep are also in the game.
I love new loves, although I’ve ever found
Each burning passion burned the same old flame.
The moon and stars and blessed sun above —
They shine and go, and shine again, like love.
The war goes on ; goes on from day to day.
Lloyd George is anxious, and the Kaiser brags.
A bit of luck, methinks, has blown our way,
For Italy last week .was waving flags.
I never skite of Right, or British pluck—
I only watch and wait and hope for luck.
The power of luck my patriot heart appals:
It conquers merit and lays virtue low
(Our milkman w6n first prize in TattersaH's.
And drank himself to death a year ago). . ' |j
The war’s a sweepstake to be drawn in Franc"':
That side will lose which draws the last mischance.
Enough of this! I cannot stop to sing
Of politics and soaring price of meat.
The Bird of Time is always on the wing,
And poor Brown sleepeth in his winding-sheet."
I spoke of him as riding in a hearse —
AIL things must die —pray God it isn’t worse.
VICTORIA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
W. M. Hughes was airily hurtling nations
through the window of the world from Lon-
don when The Bulletin last heard of him.
This is how he explained the position to the
Chamber of Commerce (29/6/T8) — at
lunch, of course:—- ,
Since I last addressed this Chamber .on the
economic aspects of the war, Russia, led by vision-
aries, fools and traitors, has vanished utterly from
the nations of the earth.
Providence, stack Russia in with the discards.
A MEASURE OF RELIEF.
"See ’ere wot the paper says: ‘Wars are
nowadays waged only for the possession
or exploitation of fertile and undeveloped
territories inhabited by inferior races.' ”
“Well, thank goodness, we're safe.”
The amendment of the Commonwealth
electoral law favored by the Federal Minis-
try consists partly of applying the alterna-
tive vote to Federal elections for members of
the House of Reps. The general machinery
of the proposed Bill is stated by Home
Affairs Minister Glynn to closely follow the
Victorian pattern. Under this system, which in
various ways has been tried in Bananaland
and W.A.—and which Deakin failed in 190 G
to induce the Federal House to accept—the
elector marks the names on the ballot-paper
in tin* order of his preference—?l. 2, 3 and so
on. The result is to ensure that the person
declared elected where three or more candi-
dates go to the poll, has a nominal majority
behind him. Unless application of the pre-
ference is made compulsory upon the elector
the system is more or less useless, since the
polling may lead to consequences just as
calamitous as when the top-mnn-in on the
first count takes the seat. The idea that the
alternative vote gives the elector any sort
of real protection against the machine-made
candidate from the party caucus is a delusion.
It certainly does not, and what is equally
certain is that if the Labor party goes to
the polls at next Oouimonwoalth election in
the dishevelled condition it is now, that party
will got soundly walloped. That is one of
the main reasons why the Bill is coming on.
IRON RATIONS.
“Prisoners (Austrian) declare that the efficiency
of the Austrian forces has ended. There is plenty of
ammunition, but no food.”— Cable.
MILTARISM: “Hungry? Pshaw! Do as I do."
Ilolman of N. S. Wales finished his fifth
consecutive year of Premiership.on June 30.
Other very consecutive Premiers inside the
Commonwealth have been Bigjohn Forrest,
of Westralia (10 years and .17 days not out.
for he retired to become a Commonwealth
Minister) ; Kingston, of South Australia (C>
years 51 months) ; Herbert, of (Queensland (0
years 1.1 months) ; Turner,of Victoria.(3 years
21 months), and Reid, of N.S.W. (5 years
11 months). Holman has certain records
of his own. He ran the expenditure up
higher and faster than any of his predecessors,
lie increased the expenditure of his State far
more than the increase of all the other States
put together. He paid more interest for the
renewal of a bigger loan than had ever hap-
pened previously in Australasia, because he
was in the biggest hole, lie has more un-
finished railways on hand than ever hap-
pened to anybody else; the falling-off in the
revenue from his public works is the biggest
slump to date; and the shortage in his public
works revenue (i.e., the excess of expendi-
ture over revenue as regards his alleged "per-
manent and reproductives”) tops the score.
Queensland’s strenuous Minister for .Rail-
ways gibed at George V. in a recent speech
because the King described him in an official
document as “our trusty and well-beloved
John Fihelly.” It does seem rather cumber-
some. but then the world is full of small
amenities, and they serve at times to grease
the wheels of intercourse. One man must
call another something unless he simply
whistles at him. “Jack” would seem brief
on the part of a king at short acquaintance.
“Old Pot” in an official document would re-
quire some getting used to. If a man is
naturally grumpy or professionally indig-
nant it is hard to say what to call him.
“Carfax”: The Federal Government
announced the other day that it had not
made up its mind whether to bring in a Bill
providing for electing the Senate on the pro-
portional representation system. As it stands
now, of course, the Senate (it has always
been the same) is a jest so far as it can be
said.to reflect popular opinion. At last elec-
tion Labor didn’t get a look in. At the pre-
vious poll the other side was severely dealt
with. It has been the same after every
election—one party getting an absurd over-
representation compared with the votes cast,
and the other a ridiculously disproportional
under-representation. But applying the pro-
portional representation system to the Sen-
ate as at present constituted cannot give
the Australian public anything materially
different from what it has had all along. So
long as each Slate has an equal number of
members it is sheer farce to claim that
representation could be made proportional
by the mere arithmetic of the returning offi-
cers. Meanwhile it might be as well if Watt
explained whether it is the intention to go
on with the idea of splitting the States into
two constituencies for Senate election pur-
poses.
“Sol M.”: Supposing there is another
wickedly-extravagant sinecure in the shape
of that “highly-paid Com-
missioner” at Washington,
or that “Resident Minister”
at London, and supposing
the Opposition wants to be
nasty, let me suggest a way.
When the appointment is
announced it might give
solemn notice that, as soon
as it comes into power, it
will annul the job, cancel
the appointment, and compel
the appointee by retro-
spective Act to refund the
salary he has received. Then
Barnacle would sit up and
Stiltstalking would say that
calamity had come upon
him.
“0.K.” : Fihelly, Minister
of Railways for Queensland,
seems proud to admit that he
referred to England—hated
England—as “a country of
cant, hypocrisy and humbug”
during a recent address.
Quite so. The description
also applies to Australia in
general and Queensland in
particular. It applies with
greater force to Ireland, and
all the other countries over-
looked by Fihelly. Cant,
hypocrisy and humbug are
common to all countries, reli-
gions, philosophies and even
Societies for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. The
error that Fihelly made was
in suggesting that these de-
plorable weaknesses of
human nature are most viru-
lent in England. But as the errors of
Fihelly won’t live after him they’re hardly
worth considering.
Apropos the suggestion that the W. M.
Hughes Ministry may appoint W. M.
Hughes to a profitable billet in London or
Washington, that sort of. place isn’t always
a. tower of refuge. The Government of
James Munro, Premier and hanker, appointed
James Munro to he Victorian Agent-
General ; but bis banks, like others, began
cracking shamefully, and Sliiels, his suc-
cessor, called him back because the deposi-
tors badly wanted to see him.
Agar I\ ynne's brief session as Vic. Rail-
ways-Mmister has brought results in at least
one important direction. When Wynne had
been relieved of his job by Barnes of Wal-
halla, he upended himself in the Assembly
and scarified the railways-administratiou
most rudely for its outrageous indifference
to the safety of shippers’ goods in transit.
The Commissioners replied, of course, in the
usual indignant manner, and certain scoffers
demanded to know why Wynne himself
hadn’t dealt with “pilferers” while he was in
office. Recent events, however, seem to have
fully justified Wynne’s outburst, a bunch of
stationmasters having actually been dealt
with in the courts (some of them gaoled
and others fined). It is an indication of
reform, hut what the Commissioners still
have ahead of them is the task of removing
temptation from the pilferer's way. This
can partially be done by introducing better
business methods, so that the railway-
officials at Bull Gully won’t be tempted to
sin by having mislaid at their feet the goods
intended for flow Flat, somewhere on the
farther side of the State.
W. .V: Ilolman has had during five years
of Premiership 21 colleagues. One of them
is dead and three are out of politics. Hol-
man entered Parliament as representative of
Grenfell in July 27. IS9B, and has sat for
that electorate and Cootamundra ever since.
Seven Parliaments. He has been Attorney-
General, Minister for Justice, .Chief Secsre-
tary, Col. Treasurer, Solicitor-General, Minis-
ter for Public Instruction and Minister for
Record Borrowing.
THE WOOING.
“Ach! Vey you say nodings?"
When there is a chance to devise some-
thing in the way of crippling Australia's
defence it isn’t missed by the anti-Austra-
lian collection which climbs into high places
and drives the file of Labor like cattle. One
of the decisions of the recent Inter-State
Labor Conference was that there should be
no military training for males under the
voting age, which is 21. That abolishes the
cadet system entirely. And, so far as
capable defence goes, it wipes out every citi-
zen below the age of 22 <>r 23, for it takes
time to make a thoroughly efficient soldier
even if he gives his whole attention to train-
ing. and a lot of time when he trains only
at odd moments, This is not a question of
preparing men for military adventure abroad.
It is a matter of making the best for the
protection of the homes, womenfolk and
children, to say nothing of the nationhood, of
the smallest handful that ever had a big
country to defend. Other countries, such
as Denmark and Switzerland, which are
absolutely non-aggressive, regard 17 or 18
years of 1 heir nationhood as the right time
to start military education : but the confer-
ence of Australian Labor bodies seems to
have taken the attitude that our young men
are a molly-coddle or feeding-bottle variety,
like the pet dog that is wrapped in cotton-
wool.
“Trot”: As Woman is gelling the fran-
chise in England, and floods of blither have
been poured out about the “influence of the
gentler sex on legislation.” a ballot recently
taken by the Textile Factory Workers’ Asso-
ciation of Lancashire on the proposal to raise
the school age to 14 years, and so abolish the
existing "half-time” system, had particular
interest. There was a two to one majority
against The best that can be said about
this is that the majority was less than voted
six years ago against raising the age to 13
and much Jess than in ’99 opposed lifting
the school age from 11 to 12. The weavers
nowadays are nearly all women, and they
went solidly for child labor. This is a com-
plete reversal <of what was expected, and
seems to show that Woman thereabouts
intends to push the polls as an anti-educa-
tionist and defender of the kid in the factory.

stolen in the post); second, he stopped losing bags;
third he resumed losing- bugs; fourth (at time of
writing) he didn’t seem to know whether to lose hags
or not.
Tub Time of Joy.
The canopy above is deeper blue,
The clouds are droves of angels in the sky,
The morning- news is dressed in pleasing hue,
The Roman eagle soars in pride on high.
All things are up except the price of meat,
And the base Hun, who falls so fast in France,
Where he is smit by men with winged feet
As George the Saint smote dragons with his lance.
But brighter suns have gilt the peaks and crags lately,
For Webster, P.M.G., has lost no bags lately.
The Time of Joy (continued) :
The Serbian’s broken lines have formed once more,
hike lions rally Belgium’s faithful few,
The Melbourne train is punctual as of yore,
There falls a yard of rain or maybe two,
And haggard plains rejoice. The kine grow fat
On grass and other natural resources.
The little hill breaks into song. The flat
Ts flattened with its load of sheep and horses.
No longer have we browsed on bones and rags lately,
For Webster, P.M.G., has lost no bags lately.
The Time of Blasted Hopes.
A shrunken sun crawls upward in the east,
And shrunken stars loaf down the heaveniy street.
A Fleshless Thing sits at the Ca-sar’s feast,
Tlie Caesar’s legions fight hard in retreat.
The flag of France flies on the backward track,
As lofty as of old, but sadly torn.
The day is grey, the night is extra black,
And no one cares if it be night or morn.
Our visioned angels are but freaks and hags again,
For Webster, P.M.G., is short of bags again.
The Time of Suspense.
And then there is a dreary interlude
When everything is more or less suspended.
We wait for omens bad or omens good,
And life is cither just begun or ended.
Our armies rally but they don’t advance:
The half-sunk U-boat lingers half-way down,
The half-burst gun stops bursting over France,
The sinking kingdoms hesitate to drown.
Thus all the universe of God hangs fire and lags
Waiting to know if Webster loses any more bags.

THE DANGER OF WORMS.
Stomach and Intestinal Worms are one of
the most common complaints throughout
Australasia. Indigestion is a primary cause,
or they may he produced by Constipation,
ol 1, through the eating of tainted food or
food improperly cooked. There is also the
possibility of their introduction into the
system in the form of cysts or germs in
fruit and meat; so that all classes of the
eonUnlinity. irrespective of age, are liable to
this Complaint.
It is not alone the irritation and annoy-
ance caused by these parasitical animals
that infest the stomach and bowels, but the
more serious consequences which will follow,
that must be kept in view. From the
highly organised and sensitive parts which
they occupy. Worms give rise to great con-
stitutional derangements and produce a
variety of symptoms, more particularly
affecting the stomach and head. Many cases
of Convulsions, Epilepsy, Hysteria, St.
Vitus’ Dance, Melancholia, Nervous Diseases,
and even Insanity have resulted from this
cause.
If the patient has a tendency to any weak-
ness, the neglect to eradicate the worms
from the system must inevitably cause the
emaciation of the whole body, and a general
breakdown of the whole organism.
NEVER TROUBLED SINCE.
“A chemist's wife,” writes Mrs. Rose
Thomas, of 20 Parry Street, East Perth,
W.A., ‘"recommended my trying Comstock's
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets for my son
Jack, who was troubled with intestinal
worms. I had tried several mixtures with-
out beneficial results, and then came to your
remedy. I found my son passed a very large
number of pin worms for several days, then
his health was restored and rest became com-
posed at night. He has never been troubled
since with these parasites for over three
years now. I have since had occasions to
personally recommend this remedy to other
similar sufferers. You can publish this
testimony whenever desired.”
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation, com-
pounded on a scientific principle for the eradication
of worms which infest the intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the worms but cause
no- injury to the stomach or bowels and do not
weaken the svstem. The pellets are prepared in the
form of a confection or lolly, have no disagreeable
taste or smell, but, on the contrary, inspire children
to take them as they would an ordinary lozenge.
Obtainable at all leading chemists and stores, or
direct from The W. 11. Comstock Co., Ltd., 23 Lang'
Street, Church Hill, Sydney ; and Parish Street, Wel-
lington, N.Z. Price 3s. 6d. per packet (6 packets

How to Make a
Good Non-Poisonous
Coug'h Mixture.
To avoid the dangers attendant upon the giving to children of cough mixtures
containing such habit-forming opium drugs as paregoric, laudanum and morphia
parents will be well advised if they make their own family cough mixture from
HEENZO (registered name for Hean’s Essence), which is a compound of non-
poisono is heibal extiacts needing only the addition of warm water and sweet-
ening- to make a most reliable treatment for chest and throat troubles. Each
bottle of HEENZO will make a pint of ready-to-use mixture. A pint of ready-
made cough remedies would cost anything from 12/- to £l. HEENZO costs
onlj 2/- (by post, 2/S), and is obtainable from all leading chemists and stores,
or direct from G. W. HEAN, Manufacturing Chemist, 178 Castlereagh
Street, Sydney.

“Te Whare”: The brown tree-snake is
rarer than the green of similar arboreal habit, itself by
no means common. I’ve met the latter twice in Monaro
(N.S.AV.) willows, the leaves of which he closely
matches in coloring, and the brown one once in the
same quarter, where he was labelled
red swamp-snake. As, however, he is
almost entirely nocturnal in habit, he is
more appropriately known as moon-
snake and sometimes as red tiger. In
coloring he is salmon-brown above
and salmon below’, with many bands
of black or umber-brown, a color-
scheme not unlike that of the tiger
species. This snake lias grooved
teeth and is of the colubrine species
(which includes the deadly black,
brown and tiger), but, nevertheless,
he is reckoned non-venomous. He is
a savage and determined fighter when
cornered. I understand that he
boards chiefly in northern and eastern
Australia. The reptile elopes witli
small birds from their perches at
night, after the fashion of the diamond-
snake, also a nocturnal forager. The
green tree-snake, on the other hand,
attaches his business end to unwary
frogs and small' birds in broad dav-
light, his groat length (it may run to over 6ft.)
enabling him to operate at a considerable distance
from his anchorage among green leaves.

“Phitteel” : Bill was deaf. He had his
heart in the game, but a keen sense of hearing
being a necessary possession at the time, he was sent
to the rear/ and put on assisting the cooks and
cleaning up about the dugouts. A trench mate saw
him mooching around one day and asked how he
was doing. Very dejectedly Bill replied, “Oh, they
got me on a bower-bird’s job pickin’ up bits
er glass and sticks.”
SAME THING.
“How sad your brother’s death. Second one gone, isn't it?”
“All gone.”
“All?’ Bui haven’t you two more?”
“Two dead, two married.”
“Ida I).”: “It was the biggest scare I ever
gbt,” said Joe. “I was fishin’ in the creek —dyna-
mitin’ for ’em. Old Peter had been missin’ for a
couple of days, and when I let off a charge, instead
of the fish, up he comes. He just rose slowly, head
first, as far.as his chest, looked at me for a moment,
reproachful-like for disturbin' his rest, and sank
again. Desert Gold and Biplane couldn’t have heat
me home. When the corpse prospectors got him he
had stones tied to his feet.”

“Mrs. Lance Rawson” : Apropos of the
jabiru, recently seen at Ballina, Richmond River
(N.S.AV.). I have seen them frequently at Bonoro
on AVide Bay, opposite Frazer's Island (Q.). They
were very shy, and' usually came along the shore in
the early morning, after small crabs, I think. Have
seen as many as four at one time. AVe knew them as
“jabirus,” but others called them gigantic cranes.
All kinds of cranes and fish-hawks were common in
AVide Bay, and pelicans came there in flocks. So
did sea curlews, and excellent eating they were when
dried and smoked like fish.

shine Cottage is ?”

“Te Whare”: Does any W.A. Abo. know
anything of the “springing centipede” mentioned by
Tom AVard in liis “Rambles of an Australian Natural-
ist”? This crawler, which, according to AVard, run-
to nearly 17 inches in length, is described as
copper-colored with greenish reflections. It draws
the tail-end of its body up to the head, forming a
loop in the same manner as some caterpillars (bush
kids call them loopers) when progressing along; a
twig. Then the beast springs 12 or 16 feet and
disappears.

JACK THE NARK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down the tracks along the Lachlan where - tis
summer all the year,
And the general atmospheric state is mostly dust and
flies;
Where the squatters and the bagmen live on mort-
gages and beer,
And the willy-willies form the only cloudlets in the
skies.
Where the blazing noonday sunshine sets the lignum
scrub alight,
And the glass is scarcely ever down below the
hundred mark,
Noams a whisky-sodden whaler who is always on the
bite,
And who answers to the disrespectful name of “Jack
the Nark.”
Now, although ’tis scarcely credible, it is a fact
withal,
That away back’ in the diggings’ days when Forbes
won passing fame
With her mile of golden wash dirt, and her nuggets,
and Ben Ball,
Jack the Nark had been the owner of her test and
richest claim.
But his name was something different then, and, as
a public man,
He was always in the vanguard when trie diggers’
lights were fought;
And he struck .for right and freedom, as a sturdy
miner can,
And his friendship and assistance never once in vain
were sought.
JUST TO AMUSE THE BOYS.
TOMMY: “Come on, [?]unt, try if yon can do
this.”
So to recognise liis services, his comrades of the field
Had subscribed to buy a. watch for him, and raised
a hundred pounds,
A neat inscription on tile back to all the world
revealed
That their pride and admiration for him had no
earthly bounds.
They handed up the present at a banquet in the hall
(.It had newly been erected near the Miners’ Rest
Hotel).
And as he made his speech of thanks he swore before
them all,
He would' keep the watch until lie died, no matter
what befell.
That watch had oft been stolen in the drunken
owner’s- sleep.
But by some freak of Mother Luck he always got it
back.
It was more than difficult to sell, ’twas harder still to
keep—
As was known to thief and publican on every west-
ern track.
So the watchful shanty-keepers never ceased in their
intent
To conclude an honest bargain and to buy it openly;
And they made Jack tempting offers (to a tenner
one man went),
Though they tried to buy it only at the finish of his
spree.
Xow, one day lie reached Condobolin (he’d been
missing for a year),
And he stumbled to the bar of Starker’s Golden
Fleece Hotel;
M ith tears of anguish in his eyes he pleaded for a
beer,
And be sobbed when from old Starker’s lips profane
refusal fell.
He subsided on the rough-hewn stool that stood
beside the door,
In his eyes -was deep despairing, and he shook in
misery.
There he lingered for an instant, then he leaped
across the floor,
And he fairly screamed at Starker: “Will you buy
this watch from me?;”
ell, they bargained long and loudly, and at last
the watch was sold
For eleven pounds, and Starker also gave a written
note
Setting out that for a week the watch he would
agree to hold,
And if Jack could then redeem it (which he thought
a thing remote)
He would charge Up ten bob interest, and the time-
piece he’d return.
So the loafers and old Starker chuckled at the
coming treat;
But their thirst was disappointed, for they saw
with great concern
The whaler rush, with bitter tears, outside and down
the street.
In he went to Keele, the jeweller, told him glumlv of
the sale,
Laying on the dusty counter the agreement he’d
received ;
And if Keele were disappointed he could see ’twas
no avail
To upbraid the trembling victim where remorsefully
he grieved.
Then Jack made proposition that if Keele would
give a pound,
He could put him in the way of beating Starker at
the post.
He would hand him the agreement. Keele observed
the course was sound,
For ho knew, the famous timepiece and had Starker
hot on toast.
He paid the note. Then sadly Jack the Nark took
up his swag
And he faced the dusty stock-route with its netting,
gates and lanes ;
And they watched him stop the mailman, saw his
faltering footsteps drag
As he clambered to the shanghai e’er it lurched
across the plains.
They were tough, case-hardened sinners; but they
felt the rising force
Of a something left within them that was near akin
to shame.
They had seen a man’s sold broken, watched the
passion of remorse,
And they maybe swung a muffled curse at what they
knew to blame.
It was on the third day this that Keele in
Stalker’s bar
To one arid all announced the fact that he had bought
Jack’s right.
He said that he’d redeem the watch. There came a
sudden jar
Of angry speech that gentred on the theme of bash
and fight.
The argument was drowned in beer; and then the
watch was bought.
'Twas Keele that jumped upon his hat and raved of
theft and sin.
Though bold inscription met his eye" upon the metal
wrought;
Old Jack the Nark had left them there ci brummy
watch of 'tin.

“Bill Bowyang”: Septic sores, or veldi
sores as they were called during the South African
disturbance, are as prevalent in Palestine as they
were in Sinai. I’ve met only one doctor here who
could cure them in quick time. Ho was a Coptic
in Upper Egypt, and his treatment consisted in
cutting the sore clean out of the affected part, after
which he used an ointment of his own manufacture.
The worst sores generally healed within two weeks.

Upon your lungs has taken hold,
To keep that cold from getting worse

GOING THE PACE.
CITY VISITOR : “I suppose you find the girls round here a hit slow.”
JOE : “Slow! Why, no; there is Dolly Smith can milk her fifteen cows before breakfast!”
' Shepherd”: No bird of Eastern Australia
?s harder to find than the coachwhip, which comes
out of the dense undergrowth only in the earlv
mornings to water. It is the male which is respon-
sible for the whip-like note. The call is often heard
hut the seeker can rarely see the producer. The
temale answers the call with “pit-wit-wee” so rapidlv
that one would think both sounds proceeded from the
same bird. If wifey does not answer, hubby calls
again, this time, however, omitting the whip-like
crack. The nest is a loosely-constructed dwelling of
twigs, lined with grass, and is in some well-concealed
spot. On the North Coast (N.S.W.) it is made in
a bunch of lawyer-vines, which, on account of the
spines, makes access to the home almost impossible
There are two eggs at a sitting, bluish-white with,
black markings.
* * * ~ *
lannatherra”: My old prad was always
noted for strict sobriety. This' day, however, we
were quietly jogging along to the next pub, when
the smell of something very dead struck us. The
moke sniffed a full supply, rapidly focussed a drying
cowhide on the adjacent fence, and in his sudden
hurry left me on the road. I took the fragrant
thing back and tried to show it to an old decrepit
wreck in the yard. Before I reached him he raised
his fore-hooves to Heaven, screamed prayers for
deliverance, propelled his old rheumatism over a
five-foot gate, and did the next two miles in 3min.
40 2-ssee. I’ve never heard of this hurry-up recipe
before. Is it the sight or the smell that horrifies
them ?
* * * *
“Eachlander”: In Perak (Malaya) the
native gets a move on when the birik-birik, or night-
jar, flies crying over his hut after dark. As soon as
the birds pass, brown brother rushes outside with a
wooden platter (sengkalan) and beats it hard with
a knife, yelling at the top of his voice something
that means “great-grandfather, bring us their
hearts. This is because the birds are believed to
fly in the wake of a spectral hunter who roams the
forests with a pack of ghostly dogs, and whose
appearance is the tip that a sudden death is about,
to transpire. The demand for the hearts is in-
tended to delude the spook into the belief that those
yelling belong to his push, in which case he will
spare them. This superstition is not so surprising
when one considers that in some parts of England,
particularly Yorkshire, the yokels perform rites
equally as strange when “Gabriel’s Hounds” are
understood to be abroad. ’These mystical canines
are, of course, merely wild-geese, but their calls are
weird enough to scare more than the superstitious
Hodge.
D.D.M.”: “E.S.S.” (B. 30/5/M8) talks
of the crow as a valuable asset to the pastoralist
because he fills his tummy with maggots, and keeps
down the blowflies. Has “E.S.S.” ever watched
his Hun friend picking the eyes out of helpless
lambs and weak mothers to digest the maggots with ?
Each sheep thus treated is worth on an average 20s.
If “E.S.S.” really grudges the shilling a head paid
for every black scavenger killed, I guess he doesn’t
own sheep.
****
‘‘Pick”: Let me assure “H.V.E.,” who
appears in defence of the bee-eating bird, that my attack
was not due to mistaken identity. My bee-eater is
a coastal bird about the size of a swallow, brown
shading to mauve underneath, slaty blue back,
with a white throat. Among South Coast apiaries
he is regarded as a worse menace than is the parra-
keet to the cherry orchard, and he is less easily
dealt with, because shooting him kills also hundreds
of honey-foragers,, and upsets the serenity and good
tempei ot the factory-hands. He feeds only upon
the honey-laden bees as they wing laboriously hive-
ward, probably because they fly low and are easily
caught.
* * * *
‘‘Silas Snell”: When Mrs. Howard died
of the second allotment of twins, following within
13 months upon the first consignment, Howard, of
Toll Gate, engaged Mrs. Toms, of Sapling Flat, to
be a second mother to the four small souls, and to
liousekeep and milk in between times. Henry
Howard was a bush-bred native who never in the
course of his 38 years had been to the city, and
furthermore had never discovered a desire to go. He
was large-limbed, lumbering, slow to think and so
dilatory in uttering his thoughts that he often forgot
wdiat they were before he could articulate them.
Mrs. Toms was a widow in her own right, and it
presently occurred to her that it would be better for
all concerned if she married Howard. Henry had
already made it apparent that his thoughts were
adrift in that direction. It was not reasonable to
expect a man of Howard’s stamp to dash in with a
proposal like an impetuous boy, but, obviously, he
was doing his best. He would come into the kitchen
in the morning or evening, falter, fumble with any-
thing he could lay hands on, stutter, “I—eh, eh” .
and go away again. It was plain to be seen the
man was greatly disturbed, and Mrs. Toms smiled
and bided her time. Meanwhile the widow worked
like a Trojan, doing three women's duties, house-
keeper, nurse and dairy-hand, with blithe enthusiasm,
all to encourage Henry, and Henry continued to drift
to her, and say, “Eh I —-I —I —eh, eh,” or words to
that effect. This went on for close upon two
years before Mrs. Tom’s patience broke down. “I
know what you want to say, man,” she cried.
“You want me to marry you. Well, for Heaven’s
sake let’s get married and be done with it.” The
shock gave Howard power of speech. “Married be
d—d!” he roared. “What I’ve bin goin’ to say is
I will not have them d—d twins barfed in hot
water!” Mrs. Toms left next day. Then Howard
got into the way of calling on her at Sapling Flat
on Sundays and odd occasions, and saying “I —I—eh
—I,” or something to that purport, while the widow
scowled blackly and gave him the broad of her back.
This, too, went on for a long time before Mrs. Toms
exploded again. “Well, you lanky idiot,” she
snorted, “do you want to tell me' how to bath a
baby ?” Howard shook his head. “No —o —o,” he
said. “I was goin’ to ask you to marry me, things
bein’ so upset after you left, but, come to think of
it, the twins is well grown now.” And Howard
went home again.
* * * *
“Yannatherra”: For callous cruelty I
commend the North Banana land abo. when he’s on
a turtle diet. Having landed one of the big sea
snails, the family prepares a fire in which
water-worn stones are made almost red-hot. The
poor old menu is stood on end and the membrane
between the back of his neck and the edge of the
shell is cut away, leaving a large cavity between the
flesh anil the roof. This cavity is partially filled
with salt water and the blood of the victim. The
stones ready, they are dropped into the gravy and a.
sizzling cloud of steam issues. Though the process
parboils the flesh and keeps it fresh, it
doesn’t kill the turtle. I have seen one alive two
days after being treated, and the protesting waggle
of his big flappers was a pitiful sight. The gorging
parties slice strips of meat off the supply at intervals
and grill them. The turtle sticks it out almost
until there is nothing left of him but the last gasp.

“Woolgar: To keep crows away acquire a
pet eagle-hawk. First catch your eagle-hawk—
anyway you like—and legrope him to a post handy
to the house. Mr. Crow sights the “pet,” and then
beats it to the skyline, leaving the fowl-yard alone.
I found my household terror after he had been
damaged by a whirlwind and a tree. But we’re
not friendly. He gets his food on the end of a 10-
foot sapling. It’s a bit awkward, but a lot safer
than feeding him out of the hand.
* * * *
“l*. R. O’Test” : Saw a fine aerial battle
some days ago between a big eagle and a flock
of ibis. The attacker knew all the tricks of the
game, and had the ibis at their wit’s end to escape.
He would dart through and break the flock into
small parties, apparently attempting to single out
one bird for an easy victim. The contest had not
ended when the ibis took to flight, heading for the
Lachlan River, 40 miles away, with Old Curved Beak
still swooping murderously.
“S. Wesley Lee” : If “Chloe” (B. G/6/’IK)
will cock her shell-like ear she will hear me intoning’
from “Fruits of Queensland,” by Albert 11. Benson,
-M.R.A.O,:—
The paw-paw bears male and female flowers, which
may be on the same trees, but are usually on differ-
ent trees, so that, it is usual to speak of male and
female trees. This is, however, a mistake, as accord-
ing to Bailey the plant is polygamous—that is to say
male, female or hermaphrodite flowers may be found
on the same or on different plants.
Benson was for some time instructor in fruit culture
to the Queensland Government. I have often come
across “male’’ trees bearing, and the crop can
usually be greatly increased by cutting out the top
of the tree.
* # * *
“Wart” : Let ine second “Scrub’s” appeal
(B. 23/5/’18) for an open season for bombing the
rotter with a gun who pots every strange bird lie
sees. There are two species of him, one who calls
himself a “sportsman” (the liar!) and shoots just for
the satisfaction of seeing the feathers fly; the other
labels himself a “scientist” (the perjurer!) and is
out to bag “specimens.” Some time ago a number
of the pretty little mag'pie-larks crossed Bass Straits
and took up their quarters in the Speck. They were
not given a chance, every one being murdered. At
different times the kookaburra has been imported to
Tassy, and 10 years ago Jack seemed likely to become
a permanent feature of the landscape; but they are
becoming - scarcer and scarcer. A couple of months
a party of so-called sportsmen were passing in
a motor-car through Gordon, and a couple of ’burras
laughed from the side trees. One of the Huns shot
both birds. May the Devil use him as a furnace rake.
THE EXPLANATION.
“Why do they write menus in French instead of plain English?”
"So that you can ask for Irish stew without Hushing."
MY OLD MATE EUCALYPTUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My old mate Eucalyptus he sits there on the shelf,
And winks at me all winter, the jolly, bottled elf!
He is the hot sweet spirit of Summer’s rustling’ trees,
And waits there for my comfort when cold winds
make me sneeze.
The gale howls in the chimney, and hard upon the
pane
The driven rain is drumming to stir my bones again.
I cough and sneeze and shiver and seek a woolly vest
And down comes Eucalyptus to warm my aching
chest.
Ifis warm breath sets me dreaming of summers hot
and still,
Of trees and tempting shadows on some Australian
hill,
And thereby he brings comfort to one half-dead of
cold,
Renewing hopes of Springtime and suns of beaten
gold.
The West Wind drives its sword-point against the
helpless lung,
But in comes Eucalyptus and out the wretch is flung.
Some put their faith in pine-trees from forests over-
sea ;
My old mate Eucalyptus will take good care of me!

BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS, CROUP AND COLDS.
THOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. 1 his
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in. preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud,” or serious illness may follow.

The Psychological Solution of Wars
(which is only a small part of the title) is
an American fragment about the Infinite and
the Infinitesimal. An astronomer is the
possessor of a long hole with glass at each
end, through which he looks at other worlds.
A religionist is the alleged finder of a hole
in the darkness of things through which he
looks at the next world. A very successful
creed gets a vast rental for its hole and is
arrogant. A very unsuccessful one hardly
makes bread and cheese out of its hole, and
is soured by disappointment. The present
orifice is small but hopeful, and belongs to
a lady, Dr. Julia Seton. It hangs out at an
address which is hereby suppressed, and issues
short, cheap gospels on such light subjects
a s “How to Make Soldiers Bullet-proof,” and
“the Science of Protective Cosmic Non-
Itesistance against Evil.” The public is
urged to send its dollar at once to a person
whose name and address will not be supplied
on application, for there are already too many
people sending away dollars. The batch of
literature which reached this office has been
destroyed, lest some weak-minded person
should get hold of it.
A book published in 1913, entitled
Memoirs of the Viceroy Li Hung-chang ,
purporting to be compiled from a translated
selection from Li’s voluminous MSS., re-
covered from his various Yamens, is now
stated by J. O. P. Bland, in his biography
of Li. to be a literary fraud. Yet no public
disclaimer of the book was ever issued by
the Chinese Government (which was _ de-
clared to have authorised the publication)
or by any member of Li’s family. It has
now'been formally stated by a member of
that family that Li never kept a diary.
The Inky Way
There are corpses all along the Inky Way
on the Westralian goldfields. In the middle
’nineties Coolgardie had two dailies and four
weeklies, Kalgoorlie two dailies and three
weeklies, Boulder and Ivanowna a daily
each, and Menzies two dailies; and at least
one and in some cases two weeklies, bi-
weeklies or tri-weeklies flourished in Norse-
man, Broad Arrow, Leonora, Morgans,
Laverton, Lawlers, Cue, Mt. Magnet and
Southern Cross. Weeklies at Meekatliarra
and Sandstone came later. The sole survi-
vors are one morning and two weeklies at
Kalgoorlie, one evening of postage-stamp
size at Boulder, one mostly-desperate weekly
each at Southern Cross, Norseman, Leonora,
Laverton, Cue, Mt. Magnet and Meekatliarra,
and none at Coolgardie, Broad Arnow, Mor-
gans, Menzies or Sandstone.
“Huffin-Guffin”: The 2000th issue of The
Bulletin (B. 13/0/TS) reminds me. A
week or two ago the Hamilton (Vic.) Spec-
tator reached its 10,000 th issue. This
paper was where J. F. Archibald first
appeared in immortal type. I learned to
read from the old sheet in the late ’7o’s. The
Spectator was a newspaper in those days.
There has been a Shanks in Adelaide
Advertiser office ever since the paper
existed. There have generally been two. T.
E. Shanks, day overseer for the past 22
years, started under his brother, then man-
ager of the job-printing department 51
years ago, and is still going strong. A son
also carries on the family tradition. In
their leisure hours the Shanks’ taste runs to
high-class music.
Isabel Gullett, sister to war-correspondent
Harry, and niece to Henry Gullett, ex-
editor of 5.M.11., is taking charge of the
Woman’s Page of Sydney Sunday Times
while Isabel Ramsay is away in America.
Miss Gullett brings an experienced hand to
the job. She was for a long time on the staff
of the British Australasian, and when
brother Harry was ill she kept his London
letter to Sydney Telegraph going so
brightly that no one noticed any difference.
An attack of pneumonia hurried the young

WORM-EATEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He could bask half his day at ease
Beneath the kindly sky,
Or lave in warm, caressing seas
Where coral islands lie;
But tied to work by curious laws
At authorship he groans,
For aye the worm ambition gnaws
His bones.
He makes no splendid vision shine
From out his careful rhymes;
His stories are not superfine—
They always die betimes.
Toil how he may no masterpiece
Will from his fountain fall.
Slave of the worm, he may not cease
At all.
At dinner, party, ball, or play
His Worm he’ll ne’er forget.
His mind holds all that men may say,
’Tis fish within his net.
The worm distracts his slumber e’en;
He dreams of fame alone.
Yet through the world he goes, unseen,
Unknown.
He grinds throughout the perfect day,
His lamp shines in the night,
And book, and story’, and love-lay
He struggles still to write.
And so he’ll struggle, wan and dry,
Till ended is his term,
A man’s life giv’n to gratify
A worm.

“Murkah” : One of the most business-like
things that Webster, P.M.G., could do would
be to limit the lettergram traffic to purely
domestic affairs. For years past the system
has been abused in wholesale fashion. Par.
9, Art. 37.2 a of the Postal Guide says:—
If more than one lettergram be lodged on the
same evening addressed to the same person or firm,
and the text indicates that one is a continuation of
the other or others, the whole shall be treated as
one lettergram and charged for accordingly.
This regulation is ignored. I have received
seven lettergrams each of 40 words, each
palpably a continuation of the preceding
one, and on bringing the fact under the
notice of the superintendent, have been in-
formed that it didn’t matter. Lettergram
rate is 40 words a Is. and Id. each addi-
tional word, therefore revenue lost 4s. on
that deal alone. Firms with an inter-State
business are using the ordinary telegram
(rate 10 words a Is.) less and less and ’grain-
ming at evening. The poorness of the inter-
state telegraph service encourages this, as
nine times in 10 the lettergram is delivered
as soon as the telegram would be. that is,
next morning. This is notably the case in
telegrams from Westralia to the Eastern
States owing to the difference in times. It
is well known among operators that two
men (sender and receiver) cannot pay their
own wages on lettergram work, and the cal-
culation takes no account' of relays.
W, E. Abbott, of Wiugeri (N.S.W.) :
So much lias been .said recently about the small
preportion of high-class cuts that are to be found in
a bullock that I will ask space for a few words.
One writer saj r s there are only 21b. of fillet steak
in a 7001 b. bullock. All the meat in a bullock can
be cut into steaks if the retailer’s customers want
steaks only. It is frequently used on Outback
stations in that way when most convenient, and I
think, in these times of scarcity, it would do our
city epicures, who think they can only cat fillet
steak, a lot of good if they had to live on shank
steak for a while.. It is all equally nutritious, and
if they died under the experiment the doctors and
undertakers would get something out of them. I
am an optimist and believe that “all things work
together for good.”

“Pick”: If anyone wants an admirable
substitute for Baltic pine, which, until the
Hun upset things, was almost universally
used for house-lining, try sassafras. Unfor-
tunately the beautiful timber is native Aus-
tralian (it grows plentifully on the Eastern
slopes of the coastal ranges) or it would
have been a favorite with thousands besides
the bush sawyer long ago. Greenish-brown
and yellow, close-grained, it cannot be util-
ised by the splitter, but when sawn it
planes down to a velvety finish that requires
only varnish to show up its beauty. Also,
its 1 carnation aroma warns off borers and
other destroyers. It suffers soon from dry
rot, though, where it touches the earth.
When seasoned it neither warps nor shrinks,
and bushmen who have tried it for the inner
shell of their cottages, will have no other.
» * * *
The Ballarat Banking Co. is the one Aus-
tralian institution of its kind which can say
that its head-office is not within reach of the
guns of a Hun fleet and handy for demolition
at an hour’s notice or less. It pitched its
tent 74 miles from the firing-line; where-
fore it may some day take a new name —the
Last Bank.

“F.N.T.”: Nowadays a fee of over £2O is
charged by some “business-colleges” and
similar philanthropists for what is alleged to
be a qualifying course in radio-telegraphy.
To parents'of youths just leaving school, too
young for the A.1.F., there is something
attractive in the idea of Willie serving his
country as a Flying Corps or deep-sea opera-
tor instead of having to “rough it”
as a .plain private. Jobs, however,
are almost as scarce as grizzly-bears in
Collins-street, while preference in the scram-
ble is very properly given to returned
soldiers. These facts don’t prevent the pro-
fiteers from trying to coax guineas. Now and
again a speedy operator is turned out, but
the progress mostly ends there. The qualified
expert has to attain a speed of 25 words
per minute and he must have a thorough
practical knowledge of the wireless
plant; yet the average “college” supplies its
“practical knowledge” by means of plans. In
a multitude of cases, when the young student
presently gets wise to actual conditions, in-
cluding the fact that the prize ahead, if he
ever catches up to it, is a couple of pounds a
week, he waves his first quarter’s payment a
fond farewell and chucks the show. Some-
body in authority should commandeer tlie
books of a sample lot of exploiters and com-
pile three lots of figures, showing (1) the
number of students completing the course
since, say, tlie beginning of 1916; (2) the
number who have given the course best after
parting with their first payment; and (...)
the number of students who have secured
jobs during the stated period.

If a Victorian shopkeeper be found by an
inspector to be in possession of light weights
the Law will, if invited, fine him and confis-
cate the false metals; but if the shopkeeper
casually puts his thumb, or even his whole
fist on the scale when weighing, say, a pound
of butter or sugar, and thereby gives his
customer three or four ounces short, the in-
dividual who is robbed has no redress what-
ever; Even the police, or the municipal
authorities have no power to take action.
This piece of rascality is becoming so fre-
quent and outrageous that even placid Chief
Sec. Bowser has persuaded himself to try to
amend the law.
According to the auditors, Brisbane City
Council has incurred a loss of £28,299 in
running its ferry services for five years.
This is without making any allowance for
office services and supervision. The auditors
point out that when P.E. leased the ferries
he used to make a profit on the. busi-
ness, but Bumble has altered all that and
thrown an inefficient service into the bar-
gain. Now the voice that was crying “'muni-
cipalise the trams” is turned off at the meter
for the time being.

“Arthur It.”: Our bread-carter used to

his filthy habits., and we were on the point
of changing our baker when a new carter
took on the job. He was spotlessly clean,
and formed such a striking contrast to the
previous man that we could not help remark-
ing on the fact to him. “Oh, that s old
Jim.” he explained. “The customers com-
plained of him being dirty, so the boss took
him off the caj't and put him on baking.

The first Australian “middleman” was
Simeon Lord. In the seventeen-nineties and
the early days of the 19tli century he pur-
chased cargoes as they arrived. In 1801 he
sold a shipload of coal to the captain of the
Cornwallis at GOs. per ton, f.0.b., taking in
exchange goods imported per the Cornwallis
at 30 p.c. on invoice price. These Mr. Lord
sold to the Governor of N. S. Wales, who
bought on behalf of the King.

“Billy T.”: He stood on the mat and
“eorfedr. Could I give him a shilling? He
gave no special reason why I should give him
a shilling, but the assumption was that any
man with the soul of a dog-tick would give a
shilling to hear a “corf” like that. “Only a
shillin’,” he said. Hastily I gave him the
coin. “That’s a bad .cough,” I said. “Yes,”
he replied. “Mother died of it.” (Corf.)
“‘Father died of it.” (Corf.) “Two of me
aunts died of it.” (Corf.) “I’m d.vin’ of it.”
‘“But,” I expostulated, “why don’t you have
treatment? I suppose it could be cured.”
“Cured?” he replied with the first flush of:
feeling. “Cured? Not me. What ’ud I do
fer a livin’?” He shuffled out and half, a
minute later I heard him corfing on the mat
next door.
* Mr Mr Mr
“F.C.” : Fenton, M.P., grew excited lately
because he had been asked lOd. for a pint
bottle of tomato-sauce. Likely enough. And
I wouldn’t card to make it this season and
retail it at even that figure. Victorian
tomatoes were a failure last summer. I
know dozens who had to plough in acres of
tomatoes —a dead loss of time, labor and
money. Now Fenton wants the price fixed
at sd. or 6d. for the bottle, the cork, the
label; the shopkeeper’s services, the manu-
facturer’s-ditto, the vinegar, spices, etc., the
sauce-maker’s wages and the tomatoes. Next
year the grower will have to be satisfied with
a shilling or 9d. a ease—second-hand cases
cost 9d. each —and then Fenton will start
drivelling about the rush to the city and
want to put men on the land.
“Scotch-and-Soda” : While Australia talks
about collaring trade, busy little Trashimura
and 0 Mimosa San are working away turn-
ing out passably imitations of everything.
Just struck this affecting inscription on p
penny-toy box :
TWA’ DOGS.
(Made in Japan.)
I’d like to hear the Highland Society’s
opinion on it. Have the kilt and the kimono
anything in common ?
“The Oldest Inhabitant’s” story :
This is mv recollection of flic beginnings of the
great London business of Spiers and Pond. In 1853
Pond kept a boarding-house in Latrobe-street West,
in Melbourne. James Mooney then built a large pub
at the eastern end of Big Bpurke-street fwe always
called it Big Bourke), a few yards away from the
Salle de Valentino. This house, which he called the
National, had an extensive cellar known as The
Shakspeare. Here from Felix Spiers and Christopher
Pond you could get a grilled chop with a potato and
“half a pint of British” for a shilling, the “British”
being obtained from the National upstairs. Presently
•Christopher Pond, a large, handsome man of win-
some manner, went to England, and Felix Spiers
joined George Hennelle, a wine and spirit merchant
of Swanston-street, in the Royal Hotel. John Black,
a carrier on the roads, had built the Theatre Royal
in 1855, but could not make it pay to suit him.
So George Coppin, in partnership with G. V. Brooke,
got the property. The Royal Hotel constituted the
front of the house. Hennelle returned to his old
business, and Pond, back from England, joined Spiers
and the Cafe de Paris, which had been the private
bar and lounge, came into existence. It was on the
same level as the dress-circle and had an entrance
thereto. On June 14, 1858, the “opening dinner”
was held, “George Coppin, Esq., in the chair.” The
menu (a copy of which is in front of me) was a
most elaborate affair —printed in red on a broad
band of white silk. After that the firm moved ahead
as “J.F.11.” described in a recent Bulletix.
• * * *
“Quidam” : Every person who has yearn-
ings to be a farmer, and just enough luck
not to be, believes that there is a ton of
money in pigs. Anyone who has become
closely acquainted with the animals and
has fed them on bought tucker can swear to
the- same fact. He can also swear to the
trouble of getting it out again. But they
are charming and winsome creatures, full of
pretty perversities that knock cold-blooded
calculation kite high. The difference be-
tween the cash return from pig-breeding on
a purely mathematical basis and the busi-
ness as translated into cold fact by the
affectionate creatures themselves is often
great enough to drive a man to whale-
faming or some other sedentary occupation.
THE TOYMAKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He sits atone before his high-placed stand
And carves his little toys so patiently.
Beneath the chisel in his fumbling hand
A soldier grows, a ship with, sails maybe.
And he who claimed the mastery of force,
Driving his mighty engines through the night,
Now paints a windmill or a wooden horse
With colored strips to win some child’s delight.
' He knew the splendor of his manhood’s power,
Swift as a flame his .leaping ardor shone;
Locked in iiis memory lies one burning hour,
That closed its carnage as the charge swept on.
He will do well, they say; he perseveres.
And so he sits throughout the long, bright years.

THE WHITLEY REPORT.
The Whitley report is the outcome of a
Special Commission appointed by the Brit-
ish Government to. inquire into the relation-
ship of Capital and Labor, with a view of
proposing such adjustments at the close of
the War as shall meet changed circum-
stances and satisfy the reasonable demands
of Labor for a larger share in controlling its
conditions; it is a most important document.
Practically it recommends a Parliament for
each industry, composed of representatives
of employees, elected from District Councils,
these being comprised of delegates from indi-
vidual Works’ Committees, which commit-
tees are again representative of the Shops’
or Departments’ Committees of the said
Works, the idea being to organise the whole
of the trades from the bottom upward.
It is an interesting fact that Cadbury
Bros., in their Cocoa and Chocolate Works
at Bournville, have, in various respects, anti-
cipated the recommendations of the Whitley
Report. Works’ Committees have been a
feature at Bournville for years past: Shop
Committees are a more recent institution.
Probably, through the mutual goodwill exist-
ing between Cadbury’s and their workpeople,
the ground is as favorable at Bournville for
the successful working of the Whitley recom-
mendations as anywhere in England. Every-
body knows there will be heavy spade work
to be done in adjusting the relations of
Labor and Capital after the War. hip “good-
will” softens the ground immeasurably. The
report that Cadbury’s Works are closed, and
their goods permanently shut out of this
market is not true. The goods now being
turned out are only limited by the supplies
of raw material allowed, and everything is
in train to restore them to their old place
here immediately circumstances permit.

Australia’s
Premier Tyre.
Made in all sizes, but only one quality—THE BEST.
Twelve Reasons Why You Should Use “COLO” TYRES Only.
BECAUSE:
1. They are made of the purest Para Rubber, with chemical admixtures, scientifically prescribed to secure the
best results.
2. The canvas is made specially to our order, and is the best that money can buy.
3. The various processes are conducted by operatives of the highest skill, under expert supervision.
4. The “COLO” gives the maximum of resiliency with the minimum of depreciation.
5. The “COLO” is procurable in ALL SIZES.
6. The “COLO” is GUARANTEED to do a 3000-miles run, and averages considerably more.
7. The “COLO” is SPECIALLY BUILT for the rough roads which are the rule in Austi-alia.
8. The “COLO” is made by an Australian Company, employing Australian workmen.
9. What any tyre will do EVERY “COLO” can do —and better.
10. “COLO” service is not service on paper. It is service on the hills and mountain-sides; it is service in the mud
and sand.
11. No matter what your destination —funeral, race-meeting, or whatever it may be—“COLO” tyres will get you
there on time.
12. The “COLO,” as a reliable, serviceable and economical tyre, cannot be improved upon.

“Fax” : The last nisrbt of the Guy Botes
Post co. at Melbourne Kiug’s brought another
reminder of the injustice and heart-burnings
appertaining to vegetable tribute demonstra-
tions. At the handing out of the bouquets
the leading lady came off best, as was only
fair, but there was a conspicuous allotment
of tribute to Mrs. Post, whose work in “The
Masquerader” hadn’t in the least contributed
to the success of the season. Meanwhile,
Katie Towers, who had given a capital per-
formance of an important character in “The
Nigger” (the play of the night), was getting
no floral tributes whatever. If anything for
her was concealed among the mass of vege-
tables it didn’t reach her whilst the audience
was looking. The omission robbed the whole
business of sentimental significance. Katie
Towers came a good second lady in the
estimation of the public who had seen both
plays, but being merely Australian (the wife
of old actor George Chalmers) she didn’t
seem to count in the festival.
“CANARY COTTAGE;’ AT SYDNEY
MAJESTY’S .
Alfred Frith, the hard drinker, tries to show
William Greene a parade of jim-jams.
“S.S.” : Said the circus hand: “There’s a
lot in that Androcles and the lion idea. When
we were in Wellington, Maoriland, some
years ago. Cleopatra, a nasty young lioness
we had. got hold of her cage mate and
wanted to gnaw his bones. We bad to singe
her off, and half a dozen of us were jabbing
at her with any spiked implement we could
lay hands on. A few days later there was
Something the matter with her ladyship’s
right foreleg. The vet. found the point of a
wooden stake broken off in tbe flesh. The
wound was festering. He drew out the
splinter and poulticed the sore and five
minutes later Cleopatra was sleeping peace-
fully. When we next visited the city a
great row broke out in the menagerie one
evening just before the performance was to
begin. Clbopatra had got a man’s arm through
the bars of her cage. She was beaten off,
taking a fair amount of the arm with her.
The man was the vet. who had eased Cleo’s
pangs a couple of years before, and he had
put his hand in to convince a friend that
wild animals have a sense of gratitude.”
Dolly Castles is suing an American
telegraph co. for £lOOO, alleging that the
noil-delivery of a telegram explaining that
she could not attend a rehearsal led her to
the sack from the “Flo Flo” show. She was
on £3O a week.
Harold Terry, author of “General Post,”
and Howard Carr, formerly a J.C.W. musi-
cal director, have collaborated in an operetta.
“Master Wayfarer,” which has been warmly
welcomed by London critics. Carr is now-
one of the most prolific manufacturers of
musical pastry in England.
Madeline Collins, of Goulburn (N.S.W.).
has made a flying start in grand opera as
Juliet, at Drury-lane. According to cable
she has the critics in full cry about tin;
“freshness, richness and purity of her voice,
and the grace and naturalness of her acting.”
From London:—
Genevieve Ward’s autobiography, “Both Sides of
the Curtain,” makes a readable volume. The veteran
actress, still going strong at 82, was largely and
advantageously assisted in its completion by her old
friend, novelist, dramatic critic, and leader-writer
Richard Whiteing, of the London Daily News.
American-born, she started in opera and continued
warbling the works of Verdi, Rossini, Bellini and
Donizetti until her voice broke. Then she had to
leave the lyric stage and take to the spoken word,
making a successful debut in Shakspenre at, Man-
chester. In her operatic days Genevieve sang with
both Charles Santley and Sims Reeves. The former
she describes as the “finest and most masterful bari-
tone I have ever known.” Sims Reeves was “voice
and nothing else, the greatest tenor of his day, but
a mere stick at acting.” Miss Ward played in
Tennyson’s “Beekct” with Irving and Ellen Terry
before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. She
was astonished to notice “how short” the Queen was,
but was impressed by the beauty of her voice. The
Queen evidently enjoyed the performance and led
the applause, with the result that the actress was
“startled to hear great approval of passages of
secondary importance that would not have got a
hand in a London theatre.” Genevieve struck a
gold-mine in “Forget-Me-Not,” a powerful and
appealing melodrama based on a romantic episode in
her own career, which she played all over Europe,
Australia, America, South Africa, and numerous other
localities. She recalls with satisfaction the building
of the Genevieve Ward wing of the Melbourne Hospi-
tal as the outcome of her farewell performance in
the Melbourne Town Hall, transformed for the
occasion into a theatre.
“Hamlet Junior”: During the recent
“Daddy Long Legs” season at the Adelaide
Royal, in one of the interludes, the
“Cavalleria Rusticana” intermezzo was
played by Will Cade, the orchestra leader, as
a violin solo. The audience was so emphatic
in its demand for more that the brilliant
buw-wagger had to repeat his contribution
before the show was allowed to proceed.
“H.”: Are Australians aware that the
late George Musgrave revolutionised the
chorus in the London theatres? The fact is
recalled in latest theatrical columns of Lon-
don Globe. When George put on his great-
est success, “The Belle of New York,” at
the Shaftesbury, he imported the first
“American Beauty Chorus” ever seen in Lon-
don. guaranteeing them three times the rul-
ing London rate. Their brilliancy, energy
and vivacity were a revelation, and there-
after the languid English chorus girls had to
look alive and whoop things up. “The
Belle,” which made a great fortune for Mus-
grave, is said to be “still yielding handsome
profits by tourist companies in the provinces
and Oversea Dominions.”
“J.F.11.” (from London) : The raising of
the military age has brought a number of
prominent players under the star shells. In a
lengthy list appear Oscar Asche 46, Norman
McKennell 48, H. B. Irving 47, Dennis
Eadie 48, Bertram Willis 44, W. FI. Berry
46. Robert Hale 44, and Gerald Du Maurier
45. The last-named, who was running J. W.
Barrie’s latest success, “Dear Brutus,” at
Wyndhara Theatre, has not waited for the
conscripts’ call. He applied immediately for
a commission in the Guards. His brother,
Major Guy Du Maurier, author of the pro-
phetic anti-German war play of seven or
eight years ago, “An Englishman’s Home,”
was killed in action. B. B. Irving is
another who waited not upon the order ot
his going. He has been told off for duty
in the Intelligence Department of the
Admiralty.
“Glen H.”: The Poverty Point par. (B.
20/G./T8) that describes old Turner, d.c.
doorkeeper at Melb. Her Majesty’s, as “a
model of tact and discretion.” reminds me.
Years ago Turner was doorkeeper at the
Princess’s, and one night, there came a pro-
minent citizen and his wife. Turner saw at
once that what had been handed to him was
not a ticket, but said nothing until the inter-
val, when the citizen came out to see about
the traditional dog. Then the agitated visi-
tor handed the doorkeeper the correct paste-
board. and received in return an elegant
card bearing the photograph and address of
a French lady, who in those days conducted
a fashionable dovecote at East Melbourne.
THE NARK.
HAS-BEEN: “Cheap lot, I call ’em. Hand
’em out the lest, an’ they treat you like
a worm!”
THE MISSUS: “Well, you got the early bird,
didn’t you, Willy?”
‘‘Dex”: As to “Joy Wattle” (B.
80/5/T8), I can’t identify the lady with the
cheap now de guerre billed as “Australia’s
Novelty Prima Donna,” but her singing
brings her plenty of popularity. Apart from
her legitimate songs she supplies impersona-
tions of Melba ( !) and a bush-girl singing.
At the Palace (Plymouth) she 'and Albert
Whelan were lately keeping up the spirits
of shivering Australian visitors.
“Stargazer”; The villain, Clifton Noyes,
in Edward Sheldon’s “The Nigger,” as pro-
duced by Guy Post, is a quaint example of
the curious perversion that turns a decent
sort of fellow into a despicable rascal, if his
views and doings happen to run counter to
the aspirations of the elegant hero in howl-
ing melodrama. Noyes owns a great dis-
tillery, which will be ruined if his cousin,
the Governor of the State, sanctions a Pro-
hibition Bill. To dissuade this man (the
hero) Noyes tells him that he (the hero)
is really a slightly discolored person, the
descendant of slave stock. Even liis
unsullied reputation belongs to the vil-
lain. But he (Noyes) will not noise these
facts abroad in Old Virginia if permitted to
continue in possession of his profitable busi-
ness —a laudable enough ambition in anyone
but a villain. The hero refuses to agree
with Noyes, so the latter points out that if
the proposed Prohibition of Liquor Bill be-
comes law% being a ruined distiller, it will
be necessary for him to take over all the
hero’s possessions, as the rightful heir. This
makes him an execrable wretch loathed by
e\ery person in the audience, each of whom,
in similar circumstances, would act as Noyes
did, more suddenly and with greater vehe-
mence. The unfortunate villain in this class
o” play can be the only strenuous upholder
of the Ten Commandments in sight, yet he
is a spiritual leper in the eyes of a vast con-
course that has its moral possibilities tem-
porarily dislocated.
“0. Ockney”; Dion Titheradge is much
to the fgre in England. He is represented, at:
time of writing, on the vaudeville stage by a
new sketch entitled “Something to His Ad-
vantage,” in which the Scotch actress Jean
Aylwin is being starred. He is also gun-
ning a three-aet comedy called "The K.C.”
at the Playhouse, Liverpool, with a Reper-
tory organisation. A press notice of the
piece runs: “The author, who was given a
genuine Playhouse call, appeared in khaki.”
“0.K.”: One of the respects in which “Do
Luxe Annie” differs from other shows im-
ported from America is in having an Aus-
tralian producer. Young A. L. Pearce was
sent to U.S.A. by the Taits to study the
business from an Australian point of view.
“75”: The music (with the exception of a
dance number) for the Maud Allan-Grein
production of “Salome,” which led to the
criminal libel action against Pemberton
Billing, was written and conducted by Aus-
tralia’s old acquaintance Howard Carr, who
for years waved a baton in the J.C.W.
employ.
Thomas Beeeham, the indefatigable ex-
ploiter of grand opera in English, is begin-
ning to reap the reward of perseverance. A
recent five weeks’ season at Drury Lane is
probably the most payable that Beeeham has
experienced since he went into the business.
A LEADING PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of course you all know Caleb Tiott.
Important roles he’d play—
Like villagers who grin and cry
“Gawd bless til’ squoire !” and then throw high
Their hats and yell “Hooray.”
In “Shouts Off Stage,” or some such part,
Tie oft revealed his matchless art.
Last week we met. “How now ?’’ asked 1.
“I’m playing lead,” was his reply.
Next night I went to see him act;
Which cost three hard-earned bob.
N6t till the hero and his kith,
Through lying tales, were threatened with
The vengeance of a mob
Did I spy Trott. When, armed with stones,
The crowd surged on, with shouts and groans,
I saw his boast witli fact agreed—
’Tvvas Caleb's job the crowd to lead !
VICTORIA.
HARRISON O.
HIS INDIRECT SUCCESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I have played Hamlet in my time”—
The dark man wagged his head.
“You’d think me guilty of a crime
By what the critics said.
“But writer chaps I do not mind;
The public is my guide.
In its respect my prize I find,
And that was not denied.
“The fine appreciation, too,
His brother artists give
Encourages the actor who
Would have his mem’ry live.
“My Hamlet was in this respect
A great success, for see
A boon that I did not expect
It duly brought to me.
“A city manager one day
Quite took me to Ms heart.
He much desired to have me play
A most important part.
“Said he: ‘My boy, since seeing you
As Hamlet (it was prime!),
I’ve simply craved to have you do
The dame in pantomime!’"

Keep an Eye on Your Tyres
To be careless with Tyres to-day is a
costly waste.
It is more than a waste of money, for it
uses up materials, rubber and cotton, and
waste is almost criminal in these days.
Tyres should be made to run every mile the
factory puts into them. To get less is a proof of
careless driving or neglect of the tyres.
Many car-owners get over 10,000 miles from
Goodyear Tyres. More get something like 7,000.
Tqo many get little more than 4,000 miles.
Yet, all Goodyear Tyres are the same. All have
the same strength of fabric. All the same tough,
harding-wearing tread.
Then, why the big difference in actual use?
Why should not all car owners get 10,000 miles
from their Goodyear Tyres?
There is only one answer.
Some watch their tyres more closely than others.
They care for them, and save themselves money thereby.
Accidents account for some loss, it is true, but even
accidents can be guarded against.
It is every man’s duty, at this time, to drive sensibly ;
to keep an eye on his tyres ; to spend a little time and
thought on them ; to get the full mileage that is in them.
HOW TO SAVE YOUR TYRES
Keep tyres properly inflated.
Repair little tread cuts promptly.
Avoid jolts, sudden stops, quick
starts
Use French talc in the casing—
not too much.
Keep out of deep ruts.
Keep front wheels true.
7. Carry a spare tube.
8. Cover your spare tyre.
9. Paint rims to avoid rust.
10. Do not use a substitute for air.
11. See nothing scrapes the tyres.
12. Wipe off oil, grease, acids with
petrol.
Goocyear Tyies, Heavy Tourist Tubes and “Tyre Saver” Accessories are easy to get from Goodyear Service Station Dealers everywhere.

THE BALLAD OF THE KAISER’S PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the lvaiser bold and bad
Who looked to land and sea
In hope that peace could still be had
Without a victory,
llis awful thunders shook the hills,
llis bolts were widely cast.
The earth was full of shames and ills ;
But, could he win at last?
He counted heads, he counted gains,
He counted tasks undone,
The close-packed graves, the battle strains,
The weight of ship add gun ;
And when the reckoning all was made
He frowned upon his work,
And very small attention paid
To Austrian or Turk.
Across the sea the mighty host
Of foemen gathered strong;
And every wave to Europe’s coast
Bore fighting men along.
America, awake at last,
Thronged to the fighting line.
It seemed the fatal die was east—
He murmured “Gott” and “nein.”
The Kaiser pulled his stern moustache,
He looked to sea and sky ;
His armies all had done their dash,
The hour had come to die.
He looked afar, he looked anear,
He looked to earth and air:
And smoothing out llis royal sneer
Betook himself to prayer.
Deeply he prayed as monarehs must
When streams of blood turn wrong
And heavy guns in which they trust
Kecoil upon the strong;
And as an answer to that prayer
There crept across the ocean
A gentle murmur on the air—
“ Peace by negotiation.”
The Kaiser leaped upon his feet —
“Call up the last reserve!
Load all the guns, brush up the fleet!
We shall not flinch nor swerve.
Negotiate,” in accents proud
He cried. “I’m game to bet
That splendid Sydney Labor crowd
Will win me London yet!”
N.s.w.
MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
Randolph Bedford :
A letter from my son in the war zone advises that
he cablegrammed me in April. It isn’t here yet.
Meanwhile a column of tripe can be wired any day
to convey the thrilling news that Jocook has had
his first cocktail and that Mrs. Hughes is delivering
messages from Australia to Englishwomen (per pub-
licity agent), and that the man who hatched the
Warwick egg has the chewing-gum habit. I’m told
that it helps recruiting. All I can say is that it
looks like it.
“Globe”: The O.C. of the liospitai-ship
was puzzled. No leave for the soldier lads
was granted for the three days we were at
the port; yet Billjim was never on board
in his proper quantity. Guards were doubled
all over the ship, but the boys seemed to
come and go as they liked. I was let into
the joke by one digger who borrowed a
ship’s suit of white duck. We had 178 of
crew come aboard that night, though she
carries only 110.
William James Gunther, Anglican arch-
deacon, who recently died at Sydney, was a
son of James Gunther, who was at
Wellington (N.S.W.) in the ’thirties
conducting a mission, under the Church
of England, to the Wiradhuri-speaking
abo. tribes of Wellington Vale, and there
the just-dead archdeacon was born in 1839.
The father, who later became Archdeacon
of Mudgee, was able to send the son to
King’s School, Parramatta, and then to
Queen’s College, Oxford, where he B.A.’d in
1862 and M.A.’d in 1865. He was ordained
in the diocese of Lindfield, and was curate of
Stephenhill in Derbyshire, 1863-65, and
coming to Australia became curate at St.
Philip’s, Sydney. He was rector of St.
John’s, Parramatta, from 1868, and unmitred
bishop of the old district until his retirement
in 1910. The King’s School owes its restora-
tion in 1869 mainly to his efforts. Mrs.
Donaldson, wife of ex-Stipendiary • Donald-
son, is a sister.
Major-General Brudenell White, Chief of
Staff to “Birdy” in the latter’s new job with
the British army, was an R.A.A. lieutenant
at Queenscliff 10 years ago. Foresight and
administrative ability put him where he is.
When he came back to Australia after a trip
to England for military training, he brought
with him the belief that war with Germany
was inevitable. Accordingly he occupied
much of his spare time in drawing up a
bunch of plans for the local mobilisation
which he thought likely to follow. When
the war started he was acting Chief of the
General Staff in Australia, and his plans
came out of their pigeon-hole forthwith.
"White was one of those who took a hand in
planning the Landing, the offensive at Lone
Pine, the Evacuation, and the subsequent
strengthening of the Australian army in
Egypt; and the new appointment puts the
hallmark on his later work in France. Now,
a t 43. he is a lean, keen, young man with a
piercing eye, a high brow, a patrician profile
and 10 letters after his name.
“Bouragi’s” old friends :
The, Church House at Samarai, where the Angli-
can missionary ceases from troubling and the wowser
is at rest, was the hostel of Billy the Cook when
the ladda and the Gira goldfields were booming and
Milne Bay and St. Aiguan’s still had a kick in
them. There he presided over high revel and dis-
pensed hospitality at a bob a nip. The present
establishment was imported from Cooktown, but
Billy’s first home was built of split palm and nipa.
Visitors slept in a detached boudoir, known as the
“dead house.” The awakening ceremony was a
simple one. Billy came to the bedside with a
bucket of rum and goat’s milk and smote the
sleeper on the nose with a pannikin. When lie
awoke he received his quota and rose or went to
sleep again. Sometimes the boss and the bucket
fell through the palm floor, but there was always
more balm in Gilead. Billy’s hens were a bit of a
nuisance. They would roost on the rafters above
the beds. They tell me that Samarai is an effete
hole now ; afternoon tea and tennis and grace before
meals.

THE STORY OF
THE MARK
OF SUPREMACY
of!i upon a time there were some Clever People who built a Big House, where
the best Singers and Musicians came and sang or played, whilst the Clever
People caught the little sound-waves and made them into wonderful things
called Records, so that beauthml music should live for ever. Other people
tried to do this too, but the people in the Big House did it so wonderfully that
nearly everybody who loved music came to them, and their fame spread all over the world.
Then the Clever People put a mark on the beautiful records and instruments they made, and
everyone who saw that mark knew that those goods were the best in the land. Other people
built shops where they sold the goods with the sign of the little dog on them, and people
who loved music flocked to their shops, and the clever people were famous ever after.

IMPORTANT.-LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes. crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay)
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-
where. Post free 1/8. Free sample posted. ROCKE. TOMPSITT & CO., Melbourne.
For your Infant or Invalid
Benger’s Food is appetising and delicious. Even the fresh new
milk used to prepare it is made lighter and easier to digest !
In the tin one food may look like another, but there the
resemblance of any other food to Benger’s ends. You prepare
mn
Food
in a way different from others ! Fresh new milk is always
used, and in a few minutes (see directions) both the Food and
the milk become blended into a dainty cream by a gentle first
process of digestion, self-contained in the Food. ’
To this, and to its great nutritive power, Benger’s owes its
unique position as “ the Food the Doctor orders. ”
Bender's Food is entirely British J n origin, ownership, and manufacture. It is sold in tins
by Chemists, etc., everywhere. Carefully follow the directions on the tin when prepaiing it.

Gunner Harold F. Renton, a Gippsland
lad who has just won the Military Medal in
France, is, or at any rate lately was. the
prize infant of his Howitzer battery. He is
6ft. one way and the other.
Professions of the six leaders of the
A.1.F.: Monash, engineer and lawyer; Glas-
gow, banker; Rosenthal, architect; Gelli-
brand, orchardist; Sinclair-Maclagan, soldier ;
Hobbs, architect. Rosenthal belongs to the
Chosen Race.
Reported for guard duty at Peter's Gate,
Sergeant Bert Doohan, of Gulgong
(N.S.W.). If the young man wasn’t the first
to enlist in N. S. Wales maybe his brother
was, for they went together to the recruiting
office in 1914 with the early-door rush. Jack
Doohan was killed at Gallipoli.
Winged westward at 28, after three years’
fighting, Squadron-commander Roderick Stan-
ley Dallas, Bananaland’s most brilliant air-
man. He had accounted for 84 machines, in-
cluding two observation-balloons, and had
collected the D.S.O. with two bars, the Croix
de Guerre and numerous “mentions.” Mt.
Morgan, his native town, mourns for its dead.
Private Brian Templer Barton, 'who was
killed in France a while back, turned right-
about-wheel on a fortune to shoulder a gun.
Last week, Barton’s estate was sworn for
probate’at £25,634. He was tending flocks
at Murrungundy, Wellington (N.S.W.),
when the roar of the war-gong reached his
ears.
Arthur Snowden, K. 8., of Melbourne, who
passed out the other day at 89, arrived in
Melbourne in 1852, when he was 28. lie was
admitted as a solicitor in 1867, and
joined the late Samuel Gillott in partner-
ship. Snowden was Mayor of Melbourne
1892-5, and served in the Leg. Council for
11 years.-
The A.I.F. got a large helping of brawn
when Frederick Agar, lately manager of the
Johnson flour-milling concern at Richmond
(Vic.), enlisted the other day. Agar is 43 as
time flies, 6ft. 3in. as height springs. He is
one of the “plutocratic” settlers on the East
Malvern hillside which used to belong to the
late Bill Knox, M.H.R. Home ties put aside
to meet the emergency are a wife and seven
young Agars.
Home from the Bible country, on sick
furlough. Leonard Potts, who wears wings
in the Army of the Clouds and has been
flying constantly for over a year. With
his brother Jack he enlisted in the 7th
Light Horse over three years back, and
both later joined up with the A.F.C. Lieu-
tenant Jack, six months ago, in an aerial
fight with a Hun became the victim of his
own success, for he brought down a taube
wallop on his own machine and was killed
instantly.
“Terry Hy Hie”: At Dubbo (N.S.W.)
last week a woman proceeded against a
neighbor for using the sort of insulting lan-
guage that the blushing cop usually writes
on a slip of paper for the edification of the
J.P. For the defence the point was
taken that, as the complainant was stone-
deaf, she didn’t hear the blankies. and con-
sequently couldn’t be insulted. The Bench
concurred and dismissed the charge, with Is.
costs against the deaf ’un. Now, I’m deaf
myself, and what I want to know is this:
Can Jones throw a hogshead of language at
me in the hearing of Smith and leave me with
no redress except the gratification of watch-
ing Smith fall down dead?
“R.8.U.” : Our little parson returned from
France the other day and, after explaining
from his pulpit that all his pre-war notions
about drinking, swearing and other indis-
cretions were now mere airy nothings along-
side a wonderful new appreciation he had
of his fellow man, he staggered an already
startled congregation by declaring that when
a wounded Billjim pal said, “Well, you’re a
good old blanker,” it was the most sincere
compliment he had ever received. The little
man didn’t rap an oath, but he went very
close to it when storming at “the eligibles,
shirkers, loafers, wasters and poltroons.”
“If,” hissed he, “I had gone forth nobly,
and had been wounded and gassed and re-
turned to my dear homeland and met you
shirkers, what would I think of you? What
would I do to you? I — er — I'would give you
a jolly good hiding!” He’ll say something
rash one of these days.
“R.S.V.P.”: The number of Rhodes
scholars at Oxford has dropped from 180
before the war to eight—six from the Brit-
ish Dominions, and two Americans. Five
/ are medical students, of whom two have
been on service, and one has had a year’s
ambulance work in France and is now
doing Government work in chemistry. An-
other has been passed out as medically unfit.
Practically all the scholars selected for the
last two or three years have got leave of
absence for the duration of the war and will
with luck find their £3OO a year awaiting
them when they are through with their
bigger job. As things stand the trustees have
decided to hang up any further selections
for a while. Last year five Australian and
one Maoriland Oxford scholars raked in a
Military Cross, and one Australian, A. P.
Boor (W.A.), was killed in action.
The Federal Government is extremely
casual in its attitude, or want of attitude,
towards the existence of citrus canker in
the Northern Territory. This disease is the
last word in fruit troubles, inasmuch as it is
not only absolutely deadly but there is no
known cure for it. The only course is com-
plete destruction of the affected trees.
Emanating from Japan it got into America,
and simply wiped out the orange groves of
Florida and other eastern States. It is
reckoned the most infectious plant disease
within human knowledge. In the work of
destroying the infected orchards in Florida
the men employed were compelled to burn
the clothing they wore while at work, as the
disease can be conveyed by such medium.
Everything in the orchards is burnt. In
1916 the pest was discovered in the Terri-
tory, and, apart from a proclamation to that
effect, the Federal authorities have done
nothing. Frenzied citrus-growers in N. S.
Wales cannot even learn if the infected trees
have been destroyed, and rumors of an .exten-
sion of the area infected are current. A
bacteriologist hasn’t even been sent to thf>
North to definitely diagnose the disease,
though beyond question it is the real thing.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, July 1,191 S.
My Dear Arini,—
Italy’s Day brought the usual surging
crowd into Martin-place, where at noon Gov-
ernor Davidson gave the raid its official
push-off. As on every other “day,” col-
lectors had been hard at work before the
milkcarts rumbled through the streets. A
procession (Whiter Bentley’s idea) wended
through ihe crowd—-centurions, Roman
ladies, gladiators, slaves, gondola, chariots
of Ben llur memory, prancing steeds, flanked
by maidens rattling collection-boxes. But
lor the liquid Italian language, as spoken
by flark-eyed signoras in some of the stalls,
the. “day” was on the same pattern as other
national appeals.
In the Town Hall a carnival for Italy's
1 >a.v raged for 48 hours. There were no
casualties; a few -scrimmages behind the
scenes merely uncorked the pent-up spirits
of our Most Exclusive. The festival' ran
11 odi Friday till late on Saturday evening.
(’< nsul-General Flos was the official opener,
His buff waistcoat was all that-was visible!
at one angle of the hall, a large frame of
lattice-work, used as a forcing bed for silk
cushions, having been built up in front of
the platform. The military cap worn by Mrs.
Fiasdu (probably part of a lady brigadier-
general’s outfit), the hem of Mrs. Kelly’s
Beg Woffington skirt, the boots of Dr.
Mafano (afterwards identified as his pro-
perty), the head of Captain Lubrano, and
a black Spanish rooster's tail-feathers (sub-
sequently recognised in the military hat
worn by the lion, organiser, Mrs. Ferrari
Passmore) were all that could be picked
out through the framework. Stallholders
of note were Airs. Charles Waldron
with Auntie Spencer* Brunt,on as first
aid (this was a nursery gear stall).
Mrs. Herbert Nelson, Mrs. .T. Leete and
Mrs. G. I’. Upton took care of the mysteries
of Ye Dressing-table Stall. Mrs. Edmund
Playfair hovered in a fancy shop. The
•A m erica n-A ustra lia n Dengue, managed by
Mrs. Brittain, sold £5O worth of sweets on
the first day. The Soldiers’ Comforts stall
(Mrs. Rutter, - Mrs. Gregory and their lady
helps) traded ’baccy and other necessities of
life in this corner, and a score or two of other
pirate crews were at their old . habits. About
the most striking get-up- consisted of bright-
blue trousers, golden yellow jackets, and
yellow hats like small pagoda towers. The
gills inside belonged to Mrs. McPhail’s
Chinese tea-house. Next door damsels in
gorgeous Javanese dresses handed round
coffee. On Saturday afternoon Wallace
Brownlow warbled.
Italy’s Day Fund had solid help from Mrs.
Jewett (French League), Mrs. Isles and
Misses P. Harwood and G. Davies. On the
male staff of lion, workers, gent-helpers E.
Gard Trouton (glued to his task in Dalton
House till any time o’ night for the past
month). A. Phillips, E. S. Marks and
L. Harvey finished up with laurels. About
£35,000, at least, is likely to be the tally.
Governor Davidson murmured the magic
words that opened the Sheep Show.
On the previous day, lean, tanned judges
had sized up the points of the woolly
dukes and duchesses, running knowing fin-
gers into the depths of silky fleeces until the
champions were selected and led forth for
the blue ribbons. For once the veteran
flock-master, Sam McCaughey, was absent
from the June pastoral felicitations on the
Agricultural Grounds.
There was a gathering of the clans when
Doris Douglass, only daughter of the William
Douglasses. Point Piper, married Charles
William Macleod, of Randwiek. Lorna
Cameron, Enid Douglass (the best girl’s
cousin) and Marjorie Macleod were the
brideSmaidens. The pretty young wife was
frocked in white ’satin shimmer under a foam
of tulle and silver lace. White orchids were
the feature of her beautiful posy. The
’groom’s present to his sweetheart were dia-
monds that glittered round a wristlet watch.
Father gave daughter away. There was a
l ig party at the Australia after the formali-
ties in old St. Philip’s Church. Charles
W. Macleod, by the way, is a nephew of The
Bulletin’s sec., Tom McMahon.
Young Sturdee. of Melbourne (father is
a doctor and uncle is the famous Admiral of
that name), left Australia as a young lieut
in the Permanent Engineers. That was in
the early days of the war, for the sappers
were not held back as were (and are) the
luckless Permanent Artillerymen. Sapper
Sturdee went through the Gallipoli tragedy
with a whole skin. Then on to France,
where he won steady promotion. News
comes now that Lieut.-Colonel Sturdee is on
Sir Douglas Haig’s staff. “I hope he woh’t
overdo it,” writes his young wife, who left
Australia about two years ago, “for his
duties begin at 8 a.m. and lie’s seldom through
till between 1 and 2 next morning.” Engineer-
adviser, or something of the kind, is Sturdee’s
position. He is an expert tunneller.
Gone back to the spume of the North Sea,
or wherever duty calls him, Walter Marks,
li.N.V.R. The forceful Australian has had
over three years’ service, much of the time
being spent in deep-sea fishing for mines and
on patrol work. A brief furlough in his
native sunshine is just; finished.
One of the well-known Mann family of
Sydney has been awarded the M.C. for gal-
lantry while on active service with a British
regiment in Italy. He is Lieut. E. Furneaux
Mann.
A very young Australian. Sub-Lieut.
Outhwaite, R.N.V.R.. not yet 19, was in the
great adventure at Zeebrugge on the night
of April 22, when the British salted some
of the enemy fleet. The lad, a son of that
R. L. Outhwaite of Victoria, swings a salute
with the coastal motor-boat service.
A youthful fair-haired bride, Graeio
Kerkham, gave the right answer when the
parson put it to her a week or two ago.
'1 he fortunate man is Edward Bradley, a
son of the W. I J . Bradleys of Glen Ormond,
Peteisham. The girl’s wedding finery was a
vision of foam-white georgette with a faint
Pink blush (supplied by pale-tinted gossa-
mer) underneath. Mounted on white taf-
feta the frock showed a glittering silver cor-
sage under a gauzy drape, Bridesmaidens
Doris Kerkham and Hilda Bradley were
fortified by the last note in fashion —
autumn-tinted crimson drapery, over pale
yellow silk. Black millinery and gorgeous
bouquets of yellow roses and autumn leaves
completed their happiness. The wedding-
party, mostly old friends and near relatives,
gathered at Petty’s. The Misses Alien,
formerly of Tasmania, were in the celebra-
tion. The Kerkhaxns, of Summer Hill, are
old Tasmanian residents and belong to a
clan which took root in the Launceston dis-
trict’s apple orchards years ago. The new
Mrs. Bradley will be . old enough to record
her vote in 18 months of so.
M. ,T. McNally, the genial artist, has been
over in Sydney for a few days. After a
dizzy round of handshaking he hurried back
to Melbourne.
“America is in
this war to a finish ;
it will never quit
till victory is
assured.” This mes-
sage from Uncle
Sam is delivered
from Consul-General
Brittain to Australia
on July 4. Australia
feels the better for
the message. The
United States is
building ships wher-
ever there is a water-
front and the Re-
public is sending the
hefty Sammies to
the war-zone with a.
speed which exceeds
the Allies’ most san-
guine expectations. The Consul who speaks
for the Republic in Australia knows Europe
as well as many of us know our Own con-
tinent. And he knows Germany. Before
joining the diplomatic service Mr. Brittain
represented his own county Columbiana in
Ohio State Legislature. That gave him four
years’ experience in practical politics.
Appointed Consul by President McKinley in
1597, he . went to Nantes, in Brittany, and
took charge there till 1902. Then he went
to Germany and made his headquarters at
Kehl. In 1907 he moved on to Prague,
Bohemia, and represented the U.S.A. in one
of the world’s most beautiful cities until
1913. When his term of office expired
Prague presented him with the highest token
of esteem they could bestow on any for-
eigner. This was a bronze bas-relief of the
lovely old town, showing in the foreground
the figure of a long-ago Bohemian princess—
an exquisite piece of art.
“While I look back to those happy years
in Bohemia,” he says, “let me repeat, what
the man in the street here does not seem to
understand, that there is a vital difference
between Bohemia and Austria. The former
is forced to fight with her hereditary enemy.
In Prague 95 per cent, of the population is
Slay, and the people are regretfully fighting
against Britain, knowing that there is no
good ground for quarrel. Germany, Bohemia
hates. As for France, she has regarded that
Republic with the greatest kindness, hav-
ing so much in common.” After Bohemia,
which, like Moravia, would be pro-Ally if it
dared, the much-travelled Brittain had a
second helping of German life as Consul in
Coburg. Leaving there in June, 1914, when
Berlin was feverishly speeding up her war-
plot, the American representative spent a
year in Auckland (M.L.) as Consul-General.
Then to Sydney. The photo is by Falk.
Cavaliere Eles, Consul-General for Italy
in Australia, arrived in Melbourne in 1914.
He is an accomplished linguist, and an able
man of affairs. The
Italian diplomat has
represented our vic-
torious ally in Tunis,
and New York. Be-
side you he appears
in his war-paint
(photo by Falk).
Sydney has seen
little of him. During
the Stricklands’
reign, he was their
guest at Government
House. Melbourne
is his official resi-
dence, but Italy's
Day brought him
over the border. The
Cavaliere (you can
call him Chevalier if
you like) is a hap-
pier man than he was a few weeks ago, for
Australia has plucked some briars from his
paths regarding local Italian Reservists
called up by their own Government for duty
at the Front. The Austrian defeat is another
rift in the clouds. Mrs. Eles is an American.
The Conservatorium has hung a fine por-
trait of the lamented pianist Yvonne Char-
vin, whose grave is fresh with flowers from
the hands of loving pilgrims. Captain Clmr-
vin, formerly of the Pacifique, found the
home-coming to Sydney insupportable with-
out his adored Yvonne. He has gone to France
via TJ.S.A. Aboard the boat that he travelled
by went the press delegates on their way to
England, and Dr. Duval, the U.S. agricub
tural wheat expert.
Six water-colors by Norman Lindsay left
Sydney on Sunday night’s express for Mel-
bourne, in charge of artist McNally. Two
of the canvases are commissions. The others
will be snapped up soon after their arrival.
Some day Lindsay will be the millionaire
brush man of Australia. Most of his work,
by the way, is done in a mountain studio.
The crowd pouring into Guy Bates Post’s
show at the Palace on Saturday night had
its individual complexions assisted by new
rose-striped globes in the foyer. The marble
stairs also glowed with the same helpful
tinting. Used to the crude white blaze that hits
the eye in most halls of entertainment (chilly
vaults at this season), women looked soothed
and comforted. The Harry Devy party sank
into their seats just before the curtain rose
and disclosed a lamp-post solitary' in a sea
of London fog. G. B. Post appears to have
some nostrum for making every separate
hair on his head shine like a streak of black
varnish. The Sydney knut will have to lie
in wait for the visitor and tear the secret
from his msthetic person. The leading lady,
Thais Lawton (Mrs. Chilcote), who has a>
massive chin, is a charming actress, very
capable of rising to the difficulties of being
married to “a double.” She wore in one act
a beautiful black frock with floating mists of
raven tulle. Lady Astrupp (Miss Adele
Ritchie) swept the floor with glittering fish-
tail finery, built on conventional lines.
Mr. and Mrs. Thorald Grant, over from
Melbourne for the Sheep Show, are old
friends of the Davidsons. The lady visitor
has been staying at Government House.
At Esther Kahn’s concert of her own
manuscript compositions in the King’s Hall
on Saturday night, a remarkable child will
play the pianoforte. The youngster’s name
is Louis Allen, not yet five summers old, and
he was discovered by the lgte Kretschmann,
Sydney’s great music master for 40 years or
thereabouts.
Recently David Storey, M.L.A., and his
wife had a pleasant surprise. It was a
cablegram signed by both their sons. The
brothers had not met for five years till they
shook hands in France a week or two ago.
The elder was finishing his medical course in
London when Germany broke into Belgium.
Both young men have been at the Front for
some time.
The Brendan Lane Mullins gold medal
for the best Australian historical paper has
gone to Malcolm W. D. Mclntyre. Scot’s
College. .John Lane Mullins, who gives this
annual trophy, dedicates it to the memory
of his only son, killed in France in 1917.
Dorothy Cumming had a narrow escape
during the Canadian part of her tour with
the Cyril Maude j co. In an old-fashioned
theatre (in which the co. had antique
accommodation for its grease-painting) the
stage switchboard was unprotected. The
Australian’s drapery, a fanciful tunic of
flimsy material with a lot of metallic trim-
ming. fused, and nearly set the girl inside it
on fire. The dress was done for, but
Dorothy emerged unhurt from the ruins.
The affluent sth Artillery Comforters had
their evening out in St. James’s Hall the
other night. At the end of a brisk concert
programme. Dr. Waddell handed the bri-
gade’s returned gunners a new set of colors.
Captain Playfair took delivery.
According to a correspondent in the Fog,
the slim figure is an outstanding feature of
a dressmaker’s bad dreams. Compulsory
rationing, which in England was fairly
strenuous last winter, limited the supply of
fats in the food, and consequently reduced
the rotundity of the average plump English-
woman of pre-war days. Here the smart
dress-builder steps in to supply the want.
As narrow skirts are coming in and tighter
corsages, the lean woman who wears them
must be renovated by her ingenious frock-
designer. The throat is muffled in soft neck-
wear. Padding is sewn inside the lining of
jacket or bodice. Quilting as a trimming
is boldly used to fill in the caverns of the
extra-gaunt. The crinoline and loose drapery
would have been a special dispensation. But
tailors and costumibres are the dictators.
They say that, the tube is back again.
A golden-wedding notice published the other
week is unique in its way. The happy pair,
Mr. and Mrs. Edwin James Dening, were
united in the bonds by Rev. W. E. Bourne
at West Kempsey on Waterloo Day in 1868,
and Mr. Bourne is still in active work as a
Methodist minister at 85 or thereabouts at
Lindfield. He was shipmate in 1864 with
Mr. Brentnall, M.L.C., Queensland, who last
week celebrated his 84th year. He left the
pulpit for the press.
Can you spare a nanny (your own or your
neighbor’s) to French’s Forest, where there
are nearly 40 families trying to extract
enough milk from five cows, two of which alre
on strike, to fill the milk pot and the baby’s
bottle in each home? The women who are
making this appeal report a tragic scarcity of
the fluid which is so necessary for the health
of Billjim’s infant. Address your offer to Miss
Rosa Gore, 114 Hunter-street. Sydney.
P.S.—-There’s not room on her premises for
the animals themselves.
Another Sydney man, H. J. Vog-an, has
gone to England to make munitions. He’s a
brilliant young Bachelor of Engineering, of
our University, who won the two-years’
fellowship given by the Walter Hall Trust
Fund.
Lucille Benstead, the brainy Australian
singer, has varied her concert engagements
on the other side by warbling on a tank
(you know the kind of tank I mean).
Egbert was its name and it lurched through
a stretch of quiet'provincial English towns
in search of war bonds.
Towards the end of July ex-Government
House, Cranbrook, will be officially thrown
open by Governor as a school for
boys under the guardianship of the Church
of England. The mansion was James White’s
home in the days when his colors so often
caught the judge’s eye at Randwick.
From. Maoriland (where the panto is
brightening the winter) comes loud praise
of dancer Maudie Arafery. The slim little
bit of thistledown is making a nightly hit in
her “Spirit of Temptation” dance.
On July 5, with intervals for rest and
refreshment till July 12, there's to be at
St. James’s Hall a “high-market.” The
Women's Reform League has £l5OO in hand
towards the purchase of a battle-plane, and
means to get the balance, about £BOO, by the
forthcoming effort.
The Soldiers’ Welcome, under the shadow
of St. Andrew’s Cathedral, will celebrate
its second birthday this week by
accepting anything yon will give for
the man in khaki. Lady Davidson is booked
to be present. The “gift afternoon”
(Wednesday in this week) will be well
assisted by music, which helps the lady
pirates to lure their victims to the browii-
paper-parcef repository.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MAMMA, DADDY AND CHILDREN all
LOVE CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless fruit laxative cleanses the
stomaeh, liver and bowels without
any griping.
A delicious cure for constipation, bilious-
ness, sick headache, disordered stomach, in-
digestion, coated tongue, sallowness—take
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig.” For
the cause of all this distress lies in a torpid
liver and sluggish bowels.
A tablespoonful to-night means all con-
stipation poison, waste matter, fermenting
food and bile gently moved out of your sys-
tem by morning without griping. Please
don’t think of California Syrup of Figs—
“Califig”-—as a physic. Don’t think you are
drugging yourself or your children. This
delicious fruit laxative cannot cause injury.
Even a delicate child can take it as safely as
a robust man. It is a most harmless, effec-
tive stomach, liver and bowel regulator and
tonic ever devised.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—which has full
directions for babies, children of all ages and
for grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Get the genuine, made by California Fig
Syrup Company. Refuse any other kind
with contempt. “Califig”—California Syrup
of Figs—is sold by all chemists in bottles of
two sizes, Is. ljd. and Is. 9d. [6

Melbourne, July 1,191 S.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Not satisfied with bringing np the pig in
the way it should go, Yestelle Watson
Cooper (whose amazing stage appearance as
an Eastern dancer a few years back is still
a subject for polite mirth) is extending her
farming activities to sheep and cattle. She
has acquired' grazing pastures at Broadford,
Sunday apd Greenvale. Sister Irene (Mrs.
L. Muller) nowadays decorates a military
hospital at Bombay, while another sister,
Blanche, is a V.A.D. in England.
Isidore Kosmiusky has been putting in a
good deal of work writing a book on jewels
which is likely to lie published soon. Isidore
finds auras and personalities in jewels; they
have violent prejudices and attractions;
some even have antagonism to each other
when put together. Other gems cling
together and buy each other drinks, as it
were.
Mrs. Fred Pett has her leg in splints still.
However, she is comforted by having a fellow-
sufferer at hand. Her small Australian
terrier broke his leg in a motor smash, and
now yawns all day alongside the bed of his
faithful mistress.
Amongst the distinguished company on
the boat that freighted Melba home was
Bobby Peel, grandson of an earl and a
descendant of the famous John'Peel, cele-
brated in the old Scotch songs.
A London paper lately remarked that Sir
Thomas Bowater (several times Lord Mayor
of London and a perpetual nephew of our
Alderman Davey) was seen in Tudor-street
wearing a belltopper. Writer remarked on
it being the first belltopper she had seen for
a week. The London belltopper is one of
the things the Kaiser has really crushed.
The sudden death of Mrs. Walter Howard
Smith of heart trouble last week came as a
shock to her friends, particularly those who
had attended with her a tea-party at Mrs.
Tom Lodiuglpom’s St. Kilda house a few
hours before her collapse. She had been
devotedly mothering the orphaned children
of her sister, Mrs. Horne. Dr. and Mrs.
Horne both died within a tragically short
period.
Senator Pearce and his little .missus are
off to Westralia by the transcontinental.
Melbourne doctors are» getting scared at
the quick spread of a new variety of influ-
enza. A warning is being advertised to every
citizen discovering a cold in his head. “Take
a precautionary dose of crushed aspirin in
quinine,” is the professional advice. This
'fill' has a trick of leaving weeks of depression
in its trail. Probably it was imported from
England, where it is at present raging, for
naturally we couldn’t make influenza in
Australia.
A “call” from Africa was lately turned
down by Scotchbyterian shepherd H. T.
Postle, formerly a. chaplain' with the A.I.F.
but now tending the flock at Beeac (Vic.).
While going through a S’African port with
Australian troops the young man foregath-
ered with certain elders of the Scotch estab-
lishment there; and they later sent him a
gilt-edged offer on behaif of a local congrega-
tion.
Mrs. Richard, formerly of France, but for
some years a neighbor of the_State Governor
and Judge tliggins at Malvern, is giving the
tricolor an extra airing these days, her son
Rene having won the Croix de Guerre.
The Royal Golfers, men and women, are
working all-in to prepare a success for their
patriotic appeal on July 5. The kiosk in
the Centreway will sell tobacco on one
side and fripperies on the other. Mrs.
Thill, Mrs. Charlie Fairbairn. Mrs. Leding-
ham and Mrs. Gatehouse will run it.
Miss Sheehan, who recently gave a concert
for the Red Cross at Healesville, during the
week-end entertained the singers who had
come so far into the hills to help. Mrs. Aus-
tral Salon Quinnell went to chaperone Peggy
Seccombe, Rose Wharton and Norah Delaney.
Kirby. Boanas and Chant also joined the
excursion.
Mrs. Waters, from Sydney, was lately in
Melbourne helping her son break through the
enlistment barriers. The youngster is 19
and is yearning to fly. He was turned down
once, but his patriotic mother got busy before
hurrying back to Sydney for Italy’s Day.
The latest Home Fires party at Mel-
bourne Mansions was in connection with
the French Red Cross. Napoleon Boffard
arranged the music. Kirby sang like a plump
lark, and the young dreamy-eyed American
baritone, Harold Bourne, uplifted a rousing
voice. Reciter Alexander Watson and the
Carlyle Smythes showed up at the party.
Lieut.-Col. Bingham has presented a
bombing aeroplane to the Australian biers
abroad. The name suggests old Melbourne
memories of Colonel Bingham, but the donor
of the aeroplane is merely a namesake of the
Colonel, in no way related to him. This one
is an English baronet, and sole surviving
partner in a Sheffield firm of electroplate
manufacturers. He fitted out a battery at
his own expense, and has seen much service
in the war.
Lieutenant F. Norman Hodges, second son
of the Judge, has died from the effects of his
war service. He married shortly before the
war pretty Vanda Clarke, second daughter
of the W. J. T. Clarkes, of Toorak.
Colonel Harold Newbigan and Chas.
Crespjn (sometime wounded) cleared off to
England via America by the last boat. Mrs.
Newbigan and her sister, Mrs. Leslie Stuart,
went with the ship as far as Sydney to wave
farewell. Mrs. Stuart is posting back
excuses to Tettie Appleton for leaving that
young person all the work of getting up the
big patriotic dance at the Stuart home. She
salves her conscience by bailing up Sydney
to buy guinea tickets for the dance. “It’s
in Grand National week,” she coaxes, and
tickets are going off well for July 10.
Colonel Stanley has been put on the retired
list. This is really heartrending to all who
love to see a well-preserved figure in uni-
form. Stanley in his regimentals has bright-
ened Collins-street for years.
The Frank Austins, of Avalon, are rejoic-
ing over a new M.C. for the family heirlooms,
Mrs. Austin’s brother, Lieut. John Sanger,
having won the decoration while with the
British guns.
The two daughters of George Hibbert,
cordial manufacturer of Sorrento (Vic.),
are even better than someone thought
(B. 20/6/T8). Hibbert himself is prac-
tically an invalid, and when the dis-
turbance in Europe started his four sons
enlisted. Unfortunately, two of them have
gone west and a third has been invalided
home. With the boys away, the sisters
kept _ the factory going, and, in addi-
tion, in spite of two painful vehicular acci-
dents, have delivered almost the whole of
the factory’s output themselves to their cus-
tomers in Sorrento and Portsea.
“A” class men of the A.1.F., returned on
furlough from the Front, are in future to
pay no fares on Melbourne public convey-
ances. The most sluggish transit-body to
make the concession was the cable-tram
Trust, which decided, after a lot of backing
and filling, that it would offer the sacrifice
upon certain conditions. Those who wish to
receive the favor must call in person at the
Trust’s headquarters and apply for their
passes. The Defence Department suggested
that it would surely be quite enough if the
Trust sent the pasteboards to the military
office, where they would be duly allotted. The
Trust, however, was adamant. Considering
that the cable-trams are only £350,000 to the
good on the past year’s operations, the
Trust of course couldn’t afford to take any
risks: but thoughtless people might be in-
clined to say that the daily habit of thinking
m tuppences made the Board less sensitive
to the fair thing than it should have been.
Cousin Adelaide’s notes :
The Cheer-Up Society has made the most of the
fortnight allotted to it by the Repatriation authorities
for its appeal for funds. Apart from the inevitable
button day, the biggest effort was a children’s fancy-
dress ball at the Exhibition. A breezy lecture by
Mrs. George Aldridge on war-work in London, a con-
cert, at the Queen’s Hall and another at the Ifut,
and a repetition of Dr. Duguid’s lecture on the Light
Horse were other items of the week’s programme.
The Royal Agricultural Society has decided that
the profits on shows for the year ending March, 1919,
are to go to patriotic funds; also that the March
Show is to be a two days’ affair only.
Lieut. K. G. Jacob, who was killed at the end
of May after service that dated from the Landing,
was the sixth son of Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Jacob,
from Kadina. Four brothers are still fighting'and
one is a prisoner of war.
The suggestion that Col. LighFs supposed house
at Thebarton should be bought and permanently
preserved has been turned down ,hy the Government
because of the “lack of authentic record that the
building in question ever was occupied by Colonel
Light.” Even Glenelg’s famous gum-tree isn’t sacred
to sceptics. It’s a suspicious world.
Captain J. R. Campbell, whose service with the
A.I.F. at Gallipoli was succeeded by a post as Com-
forts Fund Commissioner with the Fifth Division,
has returned to S.A.
July sees the launching of the South Australian
Soldiers’ Fund appeal, with the new insurance scheme
as its chief objective. If the money is forthcoming
it will mean that the dependants of members of the
A.I.F. (exclusive of those who enlist for transport
work only) will get a lump sum in addition to
ordinary allowances from the Fund to w'hich they are
entitled. The amount paid will vary from £4O for
orphans under 16 to £125 for widows with four
or more children.
An Anglican parson made his dfibut at the Wal-
laroo Police Court the other day to plead the case
of two ship’s apprentices who took French leave
from their ship to attend church service, and put
in the rest of the day ashore. He got them off with
a light fine. The captain went back and kicked the
mainmast overboard.
The Government has been stirred up on-the ques-
tion of finding employment for returned soldiers by
a deputation from the Returned Sailors and Sol-
diers’ lieague introduced by its president, Capt.
Blackburn, Y.C. Their perfectly reasonable sugges-
tions (that returned soldiers should have preference
of employment in the Government service, that
single eligibles should be retrenched before returned
men, that the authorities bestir themselves in finding
land for the 180 men now waiting for blocks, etc.)
were sympathetically enough received. Now let’s see
if anything will move.
The wife of the Rev. Henry Howard is dead, after
a brief illness. Her maiden name was Reynolds,
and her home prior to her marriage was in Bruns-

The final count of the Children’s Red Cross appeal
shows that it brought in £17,000 —an astonishing
amount to be gathered together in small sums.
One of the pretty sassiety flappers who is
on V.A.D. work in Melbourne is flashing a
diamond engagement-ring. The giver is a
Melbourne man who dabbles in science and
is busy in an English munition-factory.
The patriotic Australians who used to
object to Australian musicians going abroad to
be "finished” may rejoice that war has
slammed the doors of all the German and
Austrian music factories. But these foreign
places where fiddlers were turned out by
the dozen were useful to take the conceit
out of the occasional musical prodigy from
these parts. An experienced Australian
teacher —himself a travelled violinist —tells
with joy how. years ago, he heard and hated
a clever Australian boy who had been patted
by local critics till liis young head was
swelled out of shape. Months later he met
in Vienna a nice tamed lad who had had the
conceit knocked out of him by critical foreign-
ers as a sort of preparation for his higher
musical education. He was willing and
eager, the proper attitude for a student,
instead of being off-hand and superior. There
are one or two untravelled prodigies knock-
ing about now, and the people who admire
their talent most at the same time yearn to
see them spanked into a proper frame of
mind.
Freda Sternberg, who acted as Melba’s
pen-hand in the U.S., reached here a week
after Nellie, plumper than when she left
and charged with gossip about the Bol-
sheviki, tenori, and other untamed animals
encountered abroad. She will hail Columbia
again at the end of the year.
Billy Steele, the handsome young man
who acts as Melba’s accompanist when she
sings with the organ, and William Tainsh
have collaborated in an Australian song cycle
which provoked applause when sung recently.
Vera Carew and Norah North Barrett,
soprano and contralto respectively, are giv-
ing a concert in the Assembly Hall early in
August. Mrs. Norman Brookes, Walter
Kirby and other musical people are arrang-
ing parties for the recital, so the girls are
assured of a good and well-dressed house.
Composer Clifton Boanas has sighed a con-
tract to supply Paling’s with a bunch of songs,
and .the first batch will arrive on the next
boat—that’s if there is any next boat. The
young man delivers himself of a lot of sugar-
sweet ditties.
The Stella Power concert was more of a
welcome to Melba than anything else. Melba
held the centre of the Town Hall with her
party, which included Lady Helen. Her Ex.
looked severe in black, while Melba positively
dazzled in a gold cloak. Jimmy Dyer had
a seat of honor next Melba. Mrs. Jimmy
sat behind her husband.
Stella came forth in a dead-white frock,
very long in the skirt and very short in the
bodice. The back of the dress ended at the
waist. To keep the cold from doing its worst
she wore a fairy scarf of white tulle. Her
hair was brushed straight back from her
forehead with a tight band of ribbon across.
Oratory and vegetables were features of
the last night of the Bates Post season at
the King’s. Burly Lionel Belmore competed
with the star in the matter of applause, and
was handed, up a bottle of firewater hung
about with bones. This came from a group
of clubmen to whom Lionel had been in the
habit of-singing his favorite hymn, a touch-
ing composition asking that when he died
his bones should be pickled in alcohol. The
genial Belmore was the hit of the season
socially, Guy Bates being of a silent and
serious disposition.
A woman’s lunch-party was given at the
Oriental to farewell Mrs. Bates Post. Mrs.
Dalrymple, Mrs. G. Currie and Mrs. Gate-
house _ were foremost hostesses. Samples
of their Toorak gardens decorated the table,
and the guest’s keepsakes were expensive
little baubles such as small enamel dressing-
room clocks, jewelled powder-boxes and
Parisian bridge sets. Kirby warbled from
the gallery. Miss Zoealli sang and Miss
Woolw-orth played.
Melbourne men keen on boxing got up a lot
of enthusiasm about Bates Post’s athletic
prowess and the way he “strips.” The
American actor keeps himself fit by walking.
To paraphrase the old song that Trilby
used to sing, “Oh, don’t you remember sweet
Florence Bland Holt?” Of course, you do!
Well, Mrs. Bland may be seen every Tuesday
at the Patriotic Tea Room in the Centreway
selling delectable cakes clad in a gingham
gown with a saucy mob cap. (P.S. —Mrs.
'Bland wears the gown and cap ; the cakes go
about without frills.)
A Sydney correspondent advises that the
star’s wife who laid a beringed hand on her
husband’s shoulder at a recent Melbourne
last night, thereby intimating that she was
the real leading lady, startled and amused
Sydney playgoers when the curtain was rush-
ing up and down after the first performance
of the season was over. All the complimen-
tary vegetables had been handed across and
the speeches made, when, the house still
being clamorous, the man in charge of the
curtain decided to give them another look
at the two principals. The blind was half-
way up and the two leads were in posi-
tion getting ready to bow when the second
lady bounced on from the wings and empha-
sised her annoyance at nearly missing the
call by thumping the stage with the fiorai
wand or crutch she carried.
Emelie Polini landed in Melbourne last
Thursday amid a hail of cheers led by Guy
Bates Post. The small star was embedded in
furs, but there was enough of her brunette
prettiness visible to catch the eye. Though
she is direct from the TT.S, she was born in
England, and takes the deceptive name of
Polini from an Italian father. Georgia
Harvey, a new r American actress of the Mrs.
Wiggs pattern, came with the leading lady.
The farewell to author Vance Palmer has
been postponed until July 0. on which date
his friends will meet and tear food in his
presence at Oxford Chambers.
“An Irish Heart,” David McKee Wright’s
collection of poems, will be published at the
end of the month. The book was originally
to be issued by the author on the subscrip-
tion plan ; but it has now been taken over by
Angus and Robertson. The collection con-
tains a selection of Wright’s best work
written over a long period of years, with the
addition of some new work —his best Irish
writings. Original subscribers are to have
copies of a separate edition-I—which 1 —which ought to
make them happy.
The veteran Sam Johnstone said good-
bye to his pals of Federal Hansard
the other day, and took away a roll-top desk
as a memento of a long association. John-
stone had embalmed the fulininations of poli-
ticians in Hansard for over 80 years—first
in the N. S. Wales Parliament and later in
the Federal Parliament—and he allowed only
neurasthenia to rol) him of his enthusiasm
for work. He .was a painstaking, capable re-
porter whose shorthand was equal to Idea kin
when that breakaway was going all out.
Johnstone put an edge on his Pitman on the
Hobart press, later lending his pen to the
Sydney Telegraph.
Of all the fires that have burned at
Melba’s shrine, one started by the singer’s
late dad has lasted the longest. The Mitchell
cash that laid the foundations of Melba’s
career was made in many ways, one of its
sources being the lime-kilns which the old
man owned at Lilydale. There, year after
year for several decades past, a column of
smoke has arisen night and day, a landmark
visible for many miles around. I remember
looking down on it from the north-western
hills for the first: time more than—but that
doesn’t matter. Probably the incense is still
burning.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

The G. N. Hurdle Race, at Flemington
next Saturday, looks a fairly open event, despite
the alleged “certainty” of WeStendale, who made
new friends by winning over two miles at Wilb’ams-
town last Saturday. If staying is Westendale’s
specialty he is bound, bar accident, to carry his
lighter weight into a place; for the three-miles race.
But there are others, without 'counting the ones
above the lost. 71b. mark, whose chances will pro-
bably be spoilt by a strong pace. At time of writ-
ing, with the final acceptances no! yet arrived at,
the most likely lot appear to be I-layston, Wallalo,
Calais, Kinlark, WeStendale, Kosytli and Matchlight,
none of them old enough to be called aged, excepting
Wallalo, who was once fast enough to win the Aus-
tralian Cup. Taking one to beat the favorite the
writer picks Rosyth. This six-year-old lias a show
on his latest running, and in point of breed (by
Wallace-Cruciform) he is an impressive chance with
only 9st. 21b. against his name. *
John Wren’s gelding half-brother to Garlin
had not been much of a credit to the family until
Saturday, but he probably doesn't owe John much
now. In the Juvenile Handicap at Warwick Farm
he was backed for good solid money down to 5 to 1
in a field of 15. Also he won after having none
the best of the trip. Seeing that he was up against
really smart youngsters like New Guinea, Maltoff,
Pacific and Millie Kenilworth, there is fair reason
to suppose, in view of the betting, that Piargea may
have shown the stable he was feeling fairly well.
The youngster cost 310 guineas as a yearling.
The Newhaven gelding Lord Haven, lately
transferred from the unregistered courses, made the
rest look like William-goats in the hurdles at War-
wick Farm (Sydney) on Saturday. Jumping beauti-
fully, he cleared out like a defaulting solicitor and
won easing up. The next to arrive was 20 lengths
off, and 11 others put in an appearance at infre-
quent intervals. Some day the system of hurdle-
racing on suburban courses will be changed to pro-
vide that the first horse to get round and touch
the last shall be the winner; and, judging by some
recent displays, the race wouldn’t last long.
For her inches it would be hard to find a
better bit of horseflesh than the grey mare Lady
Liddell. She is only 14.1, and over four furlongs,
no matter what weight she has aboard, can be reued
on to run “50.” At Ascot (Sydney) on June 22 she
carried lOst. 131 b. and an apprentice boy and beat
11 others. On Saturday, on the same track, with
lOst. 121 b., in a 14.2 race, she ran all over the
track and then won from 14 others easily. The
lady is a miniature model of the thoroughbred nag.

“0.K.”; Looking at the weights for Mel-
bourne Cup, published 44 months ere the race falls
due, in order that Moses may accumulate much
dead meat on his book, one is struck firstly bv the
fact that 11 of the 26 horses weighted higher than
Bst 4lb. are English-born, and most of them are
unlikely to face the barrier. Another striking fact
is that considerably more than half the total num-
ber of entrants are handicapped below 7st. There
are 75 of them on the bottom mark, which, except in
the case of dark three-year-olds, is the handicapper’s
way of saying’ they don’t appear to have a ghost of
a chance. There may be a Derby colt concealed
among this motley gathering of gees at Gst. 71b.,
but the chances are there isn’t. The winner of Mel-
bourne Cup is rarely an under-seven-stoner. Nine
times within the last 14 years the winner has carried
not more than Bst., nor less than 7st. Gib., which is
the regulation weight for a Derby winner who has
earned a penalty. Last year the winner was favor-
ably handicapped at Bst. 4lb. This year Shadow-
land looks favorably handicapped at Sst. Gib. He
was comparatively new to the country when he ran
second for Sydney Cup with 7st. 131 b. up. If he
keeps going as at present, and is not overworked on
the track, this good-looking gee and first-clask stayer
should be one of the picks on the day. Another con-
spicuously well-treated one is Court Jester, at 7st.
121 b. He was over-rated as a three-year-old, but the fact
remains that he ran second in the Australian Cup,
and third in the Sydney Cup with 7st. 81b. How much
better handicapped is Court Jester than, say, Prince
Bardolph at Bst. 31b.? Bardolph certainly ran away
with a Sydney Cup (from a poor field), but at that
time he was already a four-year-old and his weight
was only 7st. 31b.' Coq d’Or, of course, is kindly
treated with Bst. 111 b., unless the estimates of his
English form are all wrong. But no Melbourne Cup
winner has carried as much as even Bst. 111 b. in the
last 15 years: moreover, it isn’t clear that Coq d’Or
will be acclimatised and fit by November 5, and the
awful failure of Lanins last year carried a warning
with it.

Lightweight jockey Marshall, writing from
Java, his new home, to Fred Monten, timekeeper for
the S.A. Jockey Club, says: “Java is indeed a strange
and wealthy country. Just fancy an island only half
the size of Victoria, with a population of 33 millions.
Everybody seems to have plenty of money. The
big day of a meeting is always on Sunday morning.
There are 10 races in a day. The first is run at
8.30 a.m. and the last about 12.30 or 1 p.m. There
is no set time for any race except the first; they
just run them off when they are ready. But there
is not much time wasted, as it is too hot to do any-
thing after midday. Everybody sleeps in the after-
noon and at night they gamble. The races are run
right-handed, as at Randwick. ‘Native riders are
very funny. They ride without boots, and grasp
the stirruns with their toes. There is no clerk-of-
course, and when you win a race you come back on
your own. You get a great reception from the
stand, pull up in front of the winning-post to be
photographed and receive congratulations. A native
takes oft your saddle, everybody shakes hands with
you and pats you on the back, and then you weigh
in. In fact, it is a huge picnic. I am training and
riding for Mr. Ong Sam, a very wealthy Chinaman.”

During the past 12 months the N. S,
Wales Government received £59,402 from the books
by way of betting tax, and £82,802 from the
totalisator, most of which was contributed by the
people who make small wagers. The real solid
betting transactions not being settled on the spot
were not the subject of any tax. This is going to
be remedied. Meanwhile a Sydney paper with a
fine, sense of humor accuses the Ministry of an inten-
tion to get revenue by appropriating the whole of
the fees paid by Ike to the racing clubs. Of course,
there is no knowing what a Government that appropri-
ates 7 per cent, of the totalisator turnover may
contemplate perpetrating, but if it went on these
lines —well, now just how many race meetings would
there be to bother about ?

At Cowra (N.S.W.) races last week ' the
trainers of Powdal and Flavenworth were astounded
at the poor running of their horses. An examination
showed that some skunk or skunks had driven
needles into the tendons of the nags’ hind-legs. Two
of the injured were very lame. Many efforts have
been made to dope horses, but for downright Hun-
ism the ruffians who worked this trick are easy
winners.

The Australian Waterloo Cup, to be run
at Rooty Hill this week, has not drawn so many
entries as would have been the case had Beauty Spot
not been nominated. Early nominations were
received from Victoria and Queensland, but when
it came to making the final acceptances many
owners found out something wrong with their tykes
and withdrew. Some of the stories about injuries,
etc., may have been genuine, but in most eases there
is a suspicion that owners, were suffering from
Beauty Spotitis.

The annual field trials for pointers and
setters in N. S. Wales were held at Macquarie
Fields, near Liverpool, last week. There was a large
muster of gun dogs and their proprietors, but, owing
to the dry weather and the consequent bad scent,
and the fact that very few of the quail could fly,
the trials degenerated into a farce—so much so that
on the second-last day of the meeting most of the
hound proprietors left the ground. The officials,
however, carried the farce to a conclusion, and
finally it was announced that the secretary of the
club, C. H. Gorrick, had made a clean sweep of
the prizes, his dogs, Melwood Chip (3661 points),
Wind ’Em Shot (345) and Tim Wind ’Em (327)
filling the three first places. In the puppy event
Dr. Herbert Marks won with Lavfield Firefly, Dr.
A. T. Browne’s Satan’s Shot being runner-up.

The N. S. Wales sports have not been
missing in the war game. The Rugby Union had
4000 members, 3872 enlisted, and 382 died on active
service. Metropolitan Rugby Union put 97.5 of its
eligibles into the proper togs. The Rowing Associa-
tion sent along 975. The Amateur Cyclists wheeled
in 1000, or 70 per cent, of their eligibles. The
Amateur Swimming Association contributed 851 (71
per cent.) ; Football League (Australian Rules), 6/5;
Baseball Association. 300 ; Football Association, 1000 ;
and the Amateur Athletic Association, 68.4 per cent,
of its crowd.

William Caffyn, the old-time Surrey
cricketer, has just tipped off his 90th birthda'y. He
is probably the oldest living first-class performer at
the game. Caffyn went to U.S.A. and Canada with
Wisden’s team in ’59. Two years later he came to
Australia with the first English team to visit these
parts, and wandered back in ’63. He is the only
survivor of those three combinations. George
Wootton, once a professional, is the nearest old ’un
in point of age to Caffyn, being 84. Wootton played
his first match for Nottingham in 1861 —against
Surrey and Caffyn.
* * * *
“Stumps”: N. S. Wales Cricket Associa-
tion had an attack of extra short-sightedness the
other day when it refused Mosman (second-grade
premiers) admission to the first-grade competition
next season. The first-grade premiership has been
lopsided for many years owing to one club having
a bye in turn. Moreover it is clear from the stand-
ard of play of some clubs that the competition nepds
remodelling. In ’l5-16 Middle Harbor won only
one out of 13 matches; in ’l6-17 Middle Harbor
and North Sydney each won one match out of 11;
last year Middle Harbor and North Sydney each won
three and Western Suburbs two out of a dozen.
These clubs, which are the chopping-block on which
bowlers gather good averages, are certainly not
entitled to be continually placed before the top-
notchers in the second grade, and the association
would forfeit none of its dignity if it gave another
thought to the matter.

Tv. B. Fraser (’Varsity), who came home
first in the Rugby Union 110yds. sprint championship
at Sydney last week, is an expeditious individual
when the necessity arises. At the ’Varsity champion-
ships recently he won the 120vds. hurdles (17
1-5 sec.), and was second in 100yds., 440yds. and
broad jump. Last, year he won the 440yds. and
120yds. hurdles and filled a place in the 100yds. and
broad jump. In the 1916 Queensland championships,
Fraser also filled places in the broad jump and
120yds. hurdles.

N. F. Stewart, who won Sydney Grammar
heavy-weight boxing championship last week, was
much too brawny for the other youths who stripped
for the fray. He turned the scale at 13st. 81b. In
the final, 1L K. Ward (list. 41b.), son of theatrical
manager Hugh Ward, was the David who tackled
Goliath in the semi-final; but Ward had left his
little sling at home, and the big fellow pounded him.
Stewart pulled “No. 5” in the'school crew which
won this year’s eight-oar championship. When he
finishes growing he ought to be quite a big boy.

“M.P.A.” : Passed out last week after G 6
virile rounds. Jack Graham, a picturesque figure in
Melbourne athletic circles. A really fine all-round
athlete in his day Graham, until a few days before
his death, was capable of putting the average ath-
letic youngster on his two shoulders, or otherwise
laying him out. On Coll ins-street block the old chap
presented a Dickcnsonian appearance in velvet coat
and cap—a whiff of the old days when sports went
dog-fighting and cock-fighting. Graham came from
the Southern States of America in his young days as
personal bodyguard to Hailey, of Cooper and Bailey’s
Circus, a weird old bird who carried around a thou,
of sovs. and put his takings into one pocket and
paid accounts, out of capital in t’other. Later
Graham became identified with all the big wrestling
guns—Cannon, Connors, Dinnie, Whistler, Miller,
Mons Victor, Jack Blackburn, Duncan 0. Ross arid
lesser lights of the time. He toured with Donald
Dinnie as the middleweight all-round member of the
show, and during a trip in N. S. Wales he fell out
with old Donald, who, by the way, was a bail-
tempered man. A fiei'ce row ensued. Donald chased
Graham round and round the waggons of the show,
whilst the big Scot’s lady love tried to trip the fugi-
tive, so that he was compelled to give her a push,
which enabled him to secure a. heavy whip. This
he used to such good effect on Dinnie’s head that
Donald took the count. Graham left the show before
Dinnie came around, but Dinnie went in search of
him, took his old mate back at an increased salary
and incidentally slew the fatted calf. When Graham
settled down in Melbourne he established an athletic
school of an all-round character, teaching boxing,
wrestling, single-sticks, swordsmanship, etc., besides
instructing at the, Melbourne Grammar School. He
stood as second to Buttirff Singh and Gungp. Bra ham.
It was during the Singh-Weber contests that I was
opposed to Graham as a second and as a manager.
The old chap’s experience put it well over me, parti-
cularly the night that Singh strangled Weber at
VVirths’ Circus, an action quite within the Indian’s
rights. I did hot stipulate the barring of any holds,
so really Graham had the “strangle” and a few more
points up his sleeve. Jack was very loyal to
Buttan, and against strong popular opposition stuck
fast for his end of the bout. The old man hadn’t
been quite himself since he lost his wife some time
hack, and when he got a touch of pneumonia he
didn’t care to resist it. lie leaves two huskv sons
besides two daughters. The boys both won amateur
boxing championships, and are chips off the old
block.
* * * *
“O.K. ': Jack Graham, the old wrestler
and general utility athlete, who died in Melbourne
last week, was the hero of one of the many stories
of strong-men that the’late Arthur Russell used to
tell. When Buttan Singh had just arrived in Mel-
bourne somebody brought him round to Graham’s
little academy, what time he was busy with pupils.
The modest Hindu suggested he would like to have
his wrestling powers tested by an old master of
the game, so Graham consented to give him a turn
on the mat. Buttan had hardly got going before
the wily white veteran downed him with a cross-
buttock and turned away, as though the little matter
were disposed of. The darky proposed to have
another go, but Graham excused himself on the
ground that he had his business to attend to. When
the stranger from India had gone way Arthur Rus'-
sell asked Graham why he didn’t try a second bout.
“Do you think I was going to be made to look
small before the class?” said Graham. The old
expert had discovered the cleverness of Buttan in a
minute, and knew that the cross-buttock trick
wouldn’t work again.
* * * *
“0.K.”: The death of Jack Graham sets
me thinking of a morning long ago when Tom and
Dan Fitzgerald were running their circus at the old
Alexandra Theatre, Melbourne (now Her Majesty’s).
The three fine young lions had not been “tamed” in
public for some months, owing to them having
mauled the last man who did a turn with them in
the cage. Business needed a shake up, so the Fitzes
decided to put the acid on the roaring animals and
test their tameness. The trouble was to get a man
to go into their sanctum; Jack Graham volunteered
for the job, and this was the morning of the first
rehearsal. A number of long, thin iron bars were
heated in readiness fpr poking into the cage if the
beasts showed fight. When all was prepared Jack
Graham slipped in at the door, armed with a life
preserver, and stood on guard in the near corner
of the cage. Jack’s eye rivalled the glare in the
lions’. It was a tall apartment, but the lions
nearly hit the top of it as they sprang perpendicu-
larly into the air. They were much disturbed in
their young minds, and Graham didn’t look too
happy. One of the beasts showed a marked dis-
position to see what the human intruder was made
of, so a touch of hot iron was introduced into the
proceedings. There stood the old athlete, his head
bent forward and his arm bent for action if necessary.
Tom Fitzgerald whispered to me: “Jack has an idea
that if the worst came to the worst he could wrestle
’em. He has no idea of the strength of a lion.”
The worst didn’t happen, however. The lions cooled
down a bit, and when they were clustered together
at the far end of the cage Graham slipped quietly
out again. It was an exciting three minutes.
A round up of the Australian homing
pigeon' starts next week in Vic. He is going to
France to do his bit carrying messages and assist-
ing the Billjims. Many who have watched patiently
for his return on Saturday afternoons ’way back in
Australia will be interested to know how the birds
stand the climate of France.

“Surat”: Presuming that the letters b.l.
used by “Q.” (B. 20/6/’18) signify breech-loading
(they could easily mean something different) and
that someone measured the distance to where tin-
deceased was found, it seems a pity “Q.” omitted
to state how far the hare he shot at 104 yards ran
between colliding with the accident and death. If
the hare was sitting when shot dead at the distance
what kind of high explosive does “Q.” put into his
prehistoric implement ? Given the best 12-bore gun
and strongest cartridges the odds are about 6 to 1
against “Q.” shooting a rooster stone dead at 40
yards, even with the bird tied up. If he dopbts
this he can borrow a tape and some poultry and
have a go. Owing to a descendant of Ananias con-
tinually shooting (lucks at 95 yards (across a glass)
we recently tested on a tin several guns, including
a 50-guinea affair, 32in. barrel, full choke, with
which pigeon matches have been won at Sydney and
Northern Bivers. As our friend backed down on
seeing 80 yards taped, we took a test at 00, with
42gr. powder No. 4 shot. No charge penetrated the
tin. Best pattern 11 grains. If _ “Q.” has an
explosive that will propel*, a charge from a shotgun
to kill at 104 yards, the time is ripe for pigeon
shooters to go back another 20.

“Pick” : What is the greatest number of
wild ducks that has been killed by a single charge
from an ordinary shot-gun? At Tilba Lake, South
Coast (N.S.AV.) Bill Seecombe once laid out 2T.
He took a line shot through them as they fed among
the seaweed drifting alongshore, and was so aston-
ished at the haul that he forgot to fire the second
barrel.
LOST AT SEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 met a man some days ago
Whose face was set in deepest woe.
“You’ve heard the news,” I heard him whine,
“The Wimmera has struck a mine,
And all those lives are lost at sea! ”
His tones were ‘those of tragedy.
He looked at me with visage grim.
Of course I tried to comfort him.
“Some of those lives you think are drowned
Will by the rescue boats be found.
They will turn up all right,” I said.
In deepest gloom he shook his head.
The paper in his hand he waved,
“Why, here it says not one was saved.
There were no lifebelts on, that boat
That would keep one of them afloat.
All, all are lost beneath the sea!”
He wept, that sportsman, bitterly.
“You had on board,” I said, “a wife?
A son, a friend, a treasured life?
Hut do not to despair give way,
They may be found another day.”
“Not these!” in accents grim he said,
“The paper says that they are dead.
“Those Maorilancl six horses swift
Upon the waste of waters drift.
The money that i might have won
By backing them when here they’d run !
And now as long as I shall live
1 shall the Kaiser not forgive!”
His face went grey and grim with trouble,
“I might have backed one in a double;
lie might the Melbourne Cup have won !
Oh, dash and asterisk the Hun!
Were I a younger man,” he hissed,
“I feel as though I might enlist!”
Then his face cleared: “Oh, thank the Lord,
That Desert Gold was not on board!”

With Health Everything is
Source of Pleasure
• —without it nothing else, whatever it may he, is enjoy-
able. Even the other temporal blessings—a great mind,
a happy temperament—are degraded and dwarfed for
want of it. Everything should be made secondary to health.
There’s no reason why you should *not be healthy—-
Nature intended you to be so.
The various organs of your body have certain functions
to perform. It is your duty to see that these organs are
not overtaxed or run down, which will prevent them
from properly fulfilling their respective functions. For
instance, constipation, indigestion and other disorders, of
the system are the direct result of your internal muscles
being much below normal —failing in their duty.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles
that govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and quickly bring them back to n healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best of health? Then
why not write to-day for full particulars of my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture ?
This is > proof of what I say:—
“Dear Sir, —I am writing to you to let you know
how 1 am getting on after a month’s course of your
Physical Culture. I am feeling splendid, and must
say I am very pleased with the result of the exer-
cises. I have gained 101 b. in weight, and am feeling
really well.—(Signed) I’.Ddt., Dookie (Victoria).”
Many hundreds of letters from pupils all over Aus-
tralia and New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like you to have my Booklet, “HEALTH
AND STRENGTH FROM SELF-CULTURE,” which tolls
about my methods, fees, etc. Just write name and
address across this advertisement, and send it to me,
with three penny stamps for postage.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Aaisdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous hair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women
know that for this purpose such a simple
substance as powdered pheminol may be
used, applied directly to the hair. The recom-
mended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Almost any
chemist could supply an ounce of pheminol,
which quantity should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist, you will mar your ap-
pearance still more. The new and rational
way is to take off the complexion itself, with
all its offensive marks. Just get some pure
mercolized wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. Remove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolized wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky
particles, so gradually that no one guesses
you are treating your face—unless it be by
the result, which is truly wonderful. There
is nothing like it for bestowing a natural,
healthy and beautiful complexion.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol, obtained from the chemist, is
dropped in a tumbler of hot water, which will
then of course “fizz” briskly. When the
effervescence has subsided the face is bathed
with the stymol-charged water and then dried
with a towel. The offending blackheads, of
their own accord, come right off on the
towel, the large oily pores immediately con-
tract and efface themselves naturally. There
is no squeezing, forcing, or any drastic
action. The skin is left uninjured, smooth,
soft and cool. A few such treatments should
be taken at intervals of three or four days
thereafter in order to insure the permanence
of the pleasing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
(hey are always obvious, inconvenient, and
often down-right injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get two ounces of
tammalite concentrate from your chemist and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum to prove
this. Apply this simple and harmless lotion
for a few nights to the hair with a small
sponge, and the greyness will gradually dis-
appear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in pos-
session of the formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty
specialist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve
the scalp impurities, but only adds to the
trouble by completely choking the pores with
animal matter.” The substance sticks, de-
composes. thereby causing the hair to assume
a dead, “dull color.” Avoid eggs (and soap
too) on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair,
will clear and prevent dandruff, and leave
that fine fluffy effect so much sought after.
It also removes excess oil or greasiness. [1

The human body is self-regulating and self-
healing—all that it needs is rational treatment. To
eat, drink, breathe, bathe, recreate, rest and sleep, as
Nature intended, is to lay a sure and solid founda-
tion for abundant and abiding health, strength and
capacity.
After suffering for 25 years from Dyspepsia, Con-
stipation and Nerve Prostration I learned how to
remove the causes of these maladies, and thereby
enabled Nature to restore me to robust health and
full capacity.
You can do likewise by adopting the same means.

literature.” Certainly... .F.D.: Thanks) send any-

In a jolly little country town at the Barrossa inn
You would always find Todev and Curly King;
If you happened to call they would sure to be in,
Only to give a wink for drink and start to sing.
To sing they could, they’d make the household ring,
And everyone that passed would stop to hear Curly
King:
With banjo and harp and their violin :
Their voices above the violin would stir everyone
within.
Now one day they stirred the cop Joe Maken,
They knew not what they were undertaking;
To resist they did and could not be taken,
So home they went with a severe shaking.
Next morning as they rose and opened their door,
They wondered what they’d done the day before;
So they come to the conclusion not to touch any
more
As they reckoned it was keeping them very very
poor.
... .R.S.A.: Not enough thrill. .. .C.M.M.: You
missed the chief ingredient—something to say....
Stott and Underwood: We don’t reprint; anyhow, it
isn’t worth reprinting. Nothing is worth reprinting
except your birth-certificate on your 25th birthday.
E.A.S.: Verse of no quality S.L.: All right;
have it your own way:—
Again and again the foe dashes his teeth
Against that stony wall—it makes him wreathe
And tremble, but our troops stand firm, even though
They bend back beneath the force of the enemy’s
blow;
Yet still they stand firm and will stand firm to the
end.
’Tis an inspiration to see men stand firm, my friend—
Therefore stand firm, stand firm, stand firm!
.. . .R.W.J.: So the silent English twilight made you
think in broad Scotch, did it? Serves you right...,
A.C.G.: “Soldier Bloke” poor stuff.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.M.: Nothing that suits... .H.C.: Crude both
ways... .11. N.: No use whatever... .V.M.W.: Go
ahead, carefully. .. .K.H.: One is somewhat like
Dana Gibson’s work. The other is like nothing that
this paper is aware 0f....R.H.: Not interesting
work.... Jack H.: You’re only starting to experi-
ment. Our prophesying department was closed many
years ago owing to the ruin on the turf of the
prophet... .F.G.: It’s an artistic smash... .T.H.:
The scarecrow policeman’s helmet looks like a
badly-drawn coal scuttle... .F.S.D.: No, you’re only
beginning.
“Match Maker”: I nominate the cloak-
room attendant at a. Bananaland rail-
way station for the Hungry Man Com-
petition. I have visited this station on
several occasions and at various times dur-
ing the day, and on all occasions except one
have found the room locked, and on inquir-
ing the reason for it, have been told that
“the bloke who has the key has gone home
to have a feed.” Is that why they live so
long in the North?
Correy’s Gardens, at Cabarita, on the
Parramatta Rivex, has been passed out of
the list of pleasure resorts, the property
having been secured by the British-Aus-
tralian Lead Manufacturing Co. for £lO,OOO.
The area is 12 acres, with large frontages
to the river and Kendall Bay. In the long
ago the only “resort” easily get-at-able from
Sydney was the Sir Joseph Banks Hotel
and grounds. The house was built
by Thomas Ivellett (keeper of the military
canteen in the George-street Barracks) in
the late ’forties. One Beaumont succeeded
him. Wedding feasts and “wet” parties were
a feature. Thomas Correy had a large area
of land on the Sydney side of the Sir Joseph
Banks, and in the mid-’seventies he estab-
lished “tea gardens.” In 1884 he purchased
the spot just sold.

LORRIES
The Allies’ Cause Knows No
When it became known that the
standard type of lorry as constructed
In 1914 fell short of meeting- the re-
quirements of war service, English and
American engineers collaborated, which
resulted in building the Clylesdale
Lorries. The Clyde Cars Company
have increased facilities for further
production, and Clydesdale Lorries are
now available for shipment for com-
mercial uses. This is the opportunity

INDIVIDUAL FITNESS.
This is the time when our people need to
be strong of muscle and steady of nerve.
Hysterical people are of no use in war
time. When they try to help they hinder.
Fitness should start with the individual.
If you are run down and nervous, pale and
lacking in strength to do your part, you need
more blood.
If your hand, your thumb or foot trembles
when you try to hold it still, if the lines are
shaky when you write, if you have tremors
of your lips or chin, your nerves need
strengthening.
Proper food and a good tonic will keep
most people in good health. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People are the most
popular tonic medicine in the world, harm-
less, non-alcoholic and certain in their action,
which is to build up the blood and to restore
vitality to the run-down system. For those
who are failing in strength Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are an ideal tonic.
Sufferers from nervous disorders who
have been taking treatment without benefit
should investigate the tonic method. Write
to-day to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Box / 594 G.P.0., Sydney, for the booklet.

be sent free on request. Advt.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Government has promised to inquire into the
practice oi charging returned soldiers for breakages.
We saw him on the street to-day.
He’d just come home again.
Three years ago he went away,
And it was very plain
To this or any other war
He’d go no more.
He walked on crutches and one shin,
One arm was in a sling ;
He’d lost an eye and halt' his chin.
Not this, nor anything
Could shift the grin that played around
His visage browned.
Indecent seemed his levity.
We heard a comrade say:
Deep in his country’s debt was he,
And could not hope to pay
This dear paternal land for his
Dire breakages!

BILLY T.
“Trooper Bluegum”: Even in Palestine
the Hun is a beast. In the attach on
Ammon the Camel Corps charged a trench,
and the occupants, Turks and Germans, sur-
rendered. Lieutenant Newson, an English
officer, clambered in with a bunch of Aus-
tralians and Scotties, and took possession.
He was just returning his revolver to the
holster when a German officer whipped out
a weapon and shot the Englishman dead.
An Irisli-Australian roared out: “You !”
and another Hun went to the heap.
“The Old Soldier”: Although Monash is
the first civilian to rise to the rank of General
during this war he isn’t the first man who
has made the There was Stewart,
afterwards made a peer as Lord Lymedoch,
who began life in the diplomatic service, and
afterwards raised a regiment in Perthshire
to serve against the French. ■ He first went
to Sicily, and then was sent to Spain, where
he was Wellington’s right-hand man. At
that time a lieutenant-general’s commission
only meant the command of a division.
“Y.Z.”: If the text-books are right the
marvel is that about two-thirds of bush-bred
babies are not poisoned with food before
reaching two years. Everywhere I have seen
youngsters under two years at the board,
taking what was going. Putting up
at a farmhouse in the country re-
cently, I was touched to find the infant
son, aged 19 months, served with a big slab
of cold boiled beef for breakfast. Later, the
mother —a daughter of the house —entered.
“Who gave Bub beef?” she cried, and
“Thank Heaven!” thought I, “here’s one
with a ha’porth o' common.” “Who gave
Bub this beef?” insisted the indignant
mother. “I did,” came a voice from the
next room. “Well, ain’t you got any sav?
Don’t you know he won’t eat heel without
pickles?"
“Segundo” : Shoulder to shoulder in peace
as in war is the motto of Ernest Alfred
Coleman, returned Billjim, whom not all the
civvy police and provost guards in the world
could persuade, to desert a cobber in a tight
place. The other day there was an argument
outside Melb. Town Hall, and Coleman,
seeing his mate run in, demanded that he
should be locked up also. The John Hops
proceeded to the dispersal of the crowd,
thereby giving the digger time to change his
mind. But Coleman was a man of one idea
in the matter, and as he persisted in it, he
was accommodated. “I wanted to be locked
up with the lad,” he explained to the magis-
trate next morning when he was charged with
street obstruction, “because I thought I’d be
doing him a good turn.” The Bench, reckon-
ing, apparently, that one good turn deserves
another, discharged him.
The several Royal Commissions in South
Aus., which have lately been dealing out
heavy censures to individuals, were called
to order last week. Missing heels of cheque-
books and alterations in the ledger were
in question. They had been tampered with,
said Noel Webb, the chairman, and when the
witness denied it he was met with, “I say
they have! You have admitted they have
been altered.” The witness opined that that
was different altogether. Hiram Varley, the
witness’s lawyer, entered a protest. He
put, it this way:—
You are not a judge, but an ordinary person,
appointed to make an inquiry and to report to those
who have appointed you. I think you will find, when
you investigate the Act very closely, that your powers
are practically nil.
The chairman retorted that he would go on
with the examination in his own way ; but
later in the day he explained that when he
used the word “tampered” concerning the
alterations in the books, he didn't attach
any sinister meaning to the word, but meant
“altered.” “It was unfortunate,” Varley
commented, and Webb handsomely admitted
that perhaps it was. Then the expense to
the country was proceeded with.
“B. J.S.”: The fallacy by which Maoriland
pine was considered the only fit covering for
cow-fat in transport has been buried years
apo except in a certain quarter in N. S.
Wales, where the best recommendation any-
thing could have was that it was produced in
some other place but Australia. Our own
pine has been' proved to make the fit box for
our butter. All the Queensland factories
are content to use local pine while the good
Australian factories of Northern N. S. Wales
utilise the white pine which grows in abun-
dance on the Richmond River and the head
waters of the Clai’ence. There are acres
upon acres of suitable timber land which will
provide all the boxes ever required. The
M.L. pine barracker has been a certain
factory combine with headquarters in Syd-
ney. Giving evidence before the Queensland
Commission of Public Works at Kyogle, J.
H. Allen, a director of a local butter factory,
stated that there was no better timber for
packing the fat than the hoop pine in the
district. His co. had used it for nearly three
years, and estimated that it saved no less
than £6OO a year. Asked to explain why the
Case Factory in Sydney used M.L. pine, the
witness said he thought it was because they
had taken up a lease of that pine in the
Shivery Isles. The Kyogle Factory made a
test of the two woods, and the Chief Dairy
Expert of N.S.W., W. A. O’Callaghan, re-
ported in March, 1914, that he could dis-
tinguish no difference between the butters
stored in local and those stored in MV . pine.

Rexona and Rexona Soap
Needed in Every Home.
CECIL HAINES, ff tittle Rexona Girl (from
photo by Kenelm Stump)*
Miss Cecil Haines, now
appearing in “The Masquer-
ader” with the distinguished
American actor Guy Bates
Post, is loved by all Aus-
tralian theatre-goers. Of her
many cherished stage suc-
cesses perhaps the most
popular has been “Suds” in
“Seven Little Australians.”
Cecil writes to us from
Melbourne: —•
King’s Theatre,
Melbourne, Vic.
Rexona Company, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —
Mother has told me that
I may write and tell you
how much I love llexona
Soap. One day another
soap was given to me for
my bath. I didu’t like it,
and asked mother,
“PLEASE, dear mother,
let me always have my
Rexona.” If I knock
myself we use Rexona
Ointment.
With love,
Your little friend.
(Sgd.) CECIL HAINES.
TRY THE REXONA
TREATMENT.
Rexona Soap and Ointment
are universal favorites with
everyone who values a pure
and healthy skin. The longer
you neglect your skin the
harder it will be to care for
it. DelaJ- may result in
Eczema, Ringworm, Running
Sores, or some of the many
and unpleasant forms that
skin trouble so often assumes.
Rexona the Rapid Healer and
Rexona Soap are sure preserv-
atives for the health and skin.
Rexona Soap keeps the skin
soft and pure, and Rexona
the Rapid Healer will imme-
diately eradicate any disease
which may be apparent, for
it arouses the skin to healthy
activity, so that it quickly
recuperates.
Buy a tablet of Rexona Soap from
your Chemist or Storekeeper. It is
beautifully put up anti sold at 1/- per
tablet, or you can get it in boxes con-
taining three tablets in a box. Rexona
is supplied only in triangular pots at
1/6; or in larger pots, holding nearly
lour times tue tjuantity, at 3/-.

The Battle of the Bulls.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
KIND night set its foot at the door
And the men that fought slept well,
Some in their beds and some on the
shore
And some where none could tell.
And a quiet moon went ur> the sky
With a laugh for the thorn and tree:
And maybe a tear was white in her eye
For the dead men down by the sea.
The turf was red where the fire went low,
And a mouse ran round the wall;
But never a horn was heard to blow
Nor the Death-Shee gave a call.
Quiet it was for sleep or death,
And the air of the Spring was cool,
Till the midnight woke to the roaring breath
Of the marching Ulster bull.
Blowing the challenge of years and days,
Till the black hills shook to hear,
lie walked through the land in all green
ways
With a trumpet of death and fear.
Och. hasp the door and close it tight;
Lie down and tremble .and wait.
Will the bull of the west bring up to the
fight
A long horn red with hate?
’Tis the thunder of God! ’Tis the voice of
the wind!
Over the Shannon it comes—
The Connaught bull in his anger blind
With the feet of him beating like drums.
Kind night stood with her foot at the door
And the men that had fought awoke.
Surely the dead stood up on the shore
As that tempest of battle broke.
And in Ireland, from Moyle to Clear,
The world was as deaf as a stone;
And never a word could a strong man hear
But the voice of the bulls alone.
Horn and hoof and hoof and horn !
And how would the mountains shake
And the white stars tremble till day was
born
With a misty sun in its wake !
Och, hasp the door and close it tight,
And sav a prayer to Heaven;
For the bulls of the north and west will
fight
Till the days have counted seven.
’Twas the lough that spilled its waters out,
’Twas the mountain top that fell,
And the forest that ran with a warning
shout
To hide in an old stone well.
Bellow on bellow and roar on roar,
A ploughing of death they wrought—
'Twas the dead men standing along the
shore
That looked at the way they fought.
Hoof and horn and horn and hoof —
Till the days had counted seven,
’Twas dark in the house at night and morn
While the strong men prayed to Heaven.
The folk that were out on the sea in ships
Looked over the green of the land;
And the white of the foam on the north
bull’s lips
Was like surf on a mile of sand.
’Twas the west bull’s tail that had broken
the trees,
’Twas his horn that had turned a hill —
Och, boys of beef, by Maeve’s brown bees.
Go home, you have fought your fill!
Hoof and horn and horn and hoof,
And the days have counted seven,
With the bulls of the world above the roof
To darken the light of Heaven.
And is it over and have they gone?
Och, light of the yellow sky !
’Twas kind and warm that the good sun
shone
With the green of the world in his eye.
Men and women across the land
Went out with a step of fear;
And the cold dead men lay down in the sand
In the quiet that let them hear.
But one bold eye looked over the corn
And saw through the far clouds curled
The bull of the north on the west bull’s horn
Away at the end of the world!
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WEIGHT.
Fate and a Child.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
POLICEMAN SMITH lay flat on his
face in a clump of silver-grass and
ferns at the edge of the bush. Twenty
paces behind him, securely hidden by the
tangled sweep of the undergrowth from
any but chance discovery, his horse stood
tied to the'bole of a sapling gum.
Smith’s eves were fastened on a small hut
of slab and paling in the centre of. the
clearing. lie had so chosen his position
that the approach on either side was easily
discernible. Anyone entering or leaving the
hut must, since the building had but one out-
side door, pass well within the focus of the
policeman’s vigilant eyes. So near was he
to the object of his scrutiny that, even
though the growing darkness might serve to
trick his sight, his trained hearing would
instantly interpret any unusual rustling of
the close-set bushes which crowded the very
doorstep of the hut.
For half an hour he had lain thus, silent
save for the sharp intake of his breath,
motionless but for the occasional twitching
of a limb. In spite of the chill air his
forehead was moist with tiny beads of
sweat, and the wide lapels of his heavy ser-
vice coat were thrown back as if his body
were oppressed by heat. The set expression
of his features suggested something beyond
the mere finesse of the task which he .was
there to carry out. There .was a strained,
hungry look on his lean face, a bud of
nervous glitter in his narrowed eyes, which
seemed to hint at a tremendous self-repres-
sion. His duty indeed called for the inac-
tion of the moment, but his whole soul died
out for performance.
Dusk was falling on the crest of the hills.
Deep in the narrow gullies purple shadows
•were gathering, rising swiftly upwards to
meet the murky pall of night which hung,
like smoke-drift, about the walls of the
ravine. At each gust of the rising wind the
bushes near him rustled stealthily. Uncanny
voices called from the chill recesses of the
bush, rising and falling on the strings of the
wind like the suppressed murmunngs of a
hidden host. And through them all there
sounded, insistent and terrible, the whim-
pering of a frightened child.
Two days before, his little daughter, a
tinv brown-eyed baby of four, had somehow
eluded the vigilance of watchful, loving eyes
and had wandered, God alone knew how or
where, into the wild country surrounding
their home. For two days and nights the
residents of the townshin, led by the dis-
tracted father and spurred continually by
the dreadful, self-accusing agony of the
mother, scoured the bush. Their search was
unrewarded. The child had vanished
utterly.
It was at noon of the third day that
Smith, leaden-eyed and agnostic, received a
long, peremptory wire from headquarters
giving instructions which for one brief
moment tempted him to fierce and final
renunciation of his oath of service. One
Hood, long wanted for the killing of a yaga-
bond hawker named Nathan, was thought to
be making his way back to the district over
which Smith had charge. For this was
Hood’s native place, and Hood’s old mother
had been ill to the point of death. How real
was this man’s affection for the mother that
bore him may be gauged by the fact that he
had not hesitated to emerge from a five
years’ obscurity and deliberately_ brave the
inevitable punishment which his capture
would bring upon him. Policeman Smith
had immediate orders to proceed to the Hoods’
hut, fifteen miles away on the flank of a
mountain range, and bring in his man, alive
or dead.
The thought of abandoning the search for
his child brought Smith to the verge of
madness. It was his wife, suddenly grown
strangely calm, who persuaded his accept-
ance of the position. Her woman’s surer
faith would, not allow her to question the
ruling of the Providence in which _ she
believed. The neighbors should continue
the search. It might even be that, freed
from the over-anxious activities of the
father, their efforts would be more sure of
success. This interposition, which seemed
so cruel and hard to understand,' might be
but the testing of their faith, the unseen
hand of God smoothing the paths which were
to guide their baliy’s feet to safety. So
evening came and found Smith flattened in
the grass within a stone’s-throw of his
quarry.
In the brief interval which must elapse
before the dusk would be sufficiently deep
to mask Ms approach, he sought to ease bis
tortured thoughts by sending his mind back
five years to the bleak autumn day which
saw "the commission of Jonas Hood’s crime.
Smith had been new to the district then.
At first he had known nothing of the in-
tense provocation which the ill-fated hawker
had given his slayer. His first inkling of
the truth came from a rather shocked recog-
nition of the indifference, almost amounting
to apathy, with which the countryside re-
ceived the news of Nathan’s death. In time
he came to believe that Nathan had merited
his fate to a degree which it is given few
men to merit such swift, unbending punish-
ment. It was true the Law could recognise
no distinction. Yet, when Hood had_ un-
accountably escaped, Smith had found it in
his heart to be glad, notwithstanding the
sharp official rebuke which descended upon
his own head. Under the softening influence
of time his sympathies had become more
firmly fixed than ever. Towards a hardened
criminal he would have had no such yielding
of sentiment; for Hood, self-immolated on
the altar of filial devotion, he felt nothing
but pity.
Sapphire dusk faded to the purple depths
of night. In the recesses of the bush a
bird screamed harshly. From overhead
came the peculiar zip-zip of bats _ circling
the unaccustomed space of the clearing. On
a sudden a flicker of light showed behind a
window of the now barely distinguishable
hut.
The policeman rose to his feet ana
stretched his cramped limbs carefully. The
burning impatience which consumed him
was now free to translate itself into prompt
action. Quickly, with the tread of a cat.
he felt his way through the dark and paused
with his hand on the rough knob of the hut
door. No sound came to bis straining
ears. Save for the dim streak of light
issuing from beneath the warped edge of
the doorway there was no evidence of life
within. Softly he tried the handle. The
door was not locked. Next minute he had
stepped softly across the threshliold and
pushed the door back into place behind him.
His eyes, flashing quickly over the in-
terior. rested on the cramped figures of a
man and woman sitting over a few burning
embers on the blackened hearth. Their backs
were towards him. The noise of the wind,
together with his own studied carefulness,
had gained him entry unobserved. His
glance passed on and rested on a door set m
the wall opposite. There came dimly to his
ears the stertorous breathing of _ a tired
sleeper. The grim flicker of a smile passed
over Smith’s face. He had located his man.
He stepped forward into the room. As lie
did so the woman turned slowly about in
her seat and faced him.
Familiar as his calling had made him wdth
the display of human emotions, the police-
man felt his heart suddenly contract with
pity. The open mouth, the wide, terrified
eyes, the palsied motion of the thin hand
lifted suddenly to the withered bosom—
these things gripped his manhood so that,
remembering his own child wandering in
the blackness without, he tried to speak and
could not. Presently, he found himself.
“Where’s Jonas?”

like this.”
A look of almost cunning came into the
old ( wrinkled face.
i a 00c i son > a good son! Ah, but you
don t know what kept my Jonas here. Smart
as you are, you don’t know that. He would
have been safe away long before you come
only he turned back again.”
With his hand on the door of the bedroom
the pohceman paused a second time.
He turned back? Why did he do that?”
The old woman dragged herself across the
floor to his side. “Yes, lie come back. Say
10’s all bad, if you want to, but remember
he come back when he didn’t need to. He
had to choose, and maybe there ain’t no
Hod. Ho in and see. And then, if you
want to, take him away and hang him —my
Jonas!
The door fell in at their touch. The light
u'om the lamp at their backs went dimly
past them into the narrow space beyond.
Stretched on the bed was a fully-clothed
man, haggard and unshaven, his face vacant
with heavy sleep. There was something on
the bed at his side. The policeman bent
lower to see what it was. He saw a child,
white-faced and strangely shrunken, but
breathing peacefully. The head of tangled
curls rested on the man’s heart. The tiny
fingers of one hand were twined in his.
Smith stood looking down at them like a
man suddenly roused from a hideous nignt-
mare. Then he cried: “Marjorie! O God!
... .my little Marjorie!” and dropped on his
knees by the bedside.
The old woman began to whimper softly.
“He come back for the sake of the little ’un.
Hed have been clear away, but ho couldn’t
leave the little un to die in the bush. And
then he went to sleep and I couldn’t wake
him. She was tugging at his arm in an
agony of hope. “You ain’t going to take my
Jonas away. God wouldn’t let yon. He
fetched the little thing home and fed it •
and then he was tired and went to sleep and
I couldn’t wake him.”
For answer Smith did a strange thing
Pushing her gently aside he bent for a
second over the unconscious man on the bed
and held his lips to the roughened fingers
-r the hand that had strangled Nathan the
Jew the hand that had brought back the
love of God to his own heart. Then, with
the still sleeping child hugged fiercely to his
breast, he went out into the night.
BERNARD CRONIN.
The Comings and Goings of Jim.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JIM was Mother’s joy, but Dad wasn’t
keen on him by any means. I’m Bill,
and Jim is my younger brother.
There is more than a good deal to do on a
fair-sized farm like ours, and *Tini wasn’t
keen on bogging into any of it. That’s why
the old man wasn’t keen on Jim.
Dad managed to put up with me. I put
up with Jim. Mother put up with the lot
of us, and Jim put it on all of us whenever
he got the chance.
Dad got a kind of bad taste in his mouth
at the mere look of him ever since Jim
burned ten tons of hay. There’s no sense
in smoking cigarettes about a haystack. Dad
threatened to kick him out about once a
week, but Mother always managed to save
him till he was twenty. «
Just about that time Dad got put out bad
about the jersey heifer falling into the creek.
Of course she must fall into a dry place and
break her neck. Up till then she had been
the apple-tree of Dad’s eye, besides being
the envy of the neighbors.
However, as she wasn’t expected to fall
up and unbreak her neck, Dad spent part
ot the morning skinning her while I went in
for a bit of plough exercise.
With gloom in his eye, sorrow in his
heart, and the hide on his back, Dad re-
turned towards the house.
Mother was swinging Douglas at the wood-
heap, while Jim took casual observations
from the doorstep through a cloud of cigar-
ette reek.
Just as Dad sighted these proceedings the
axe above called Douglas—glanced from a
piece of wood and the blade got mother on
the foot. It was a severe cut. She went
down in a faint, so it must have been bad.
Before Jim could obtain sufficient pur-
chase to raise himself to his feet Dad had
earned Mother to the door. He kicked Jim
in the breakfast part to hasten him out
of the way. And he succeeded. Jim
could be pretty brisk sometimes, so he
hurried down to the stable and was unwell.
He had eaten just as hearty a breakfast as
usual, and Dad’s fancy in footwear was iron-
clad.
After we had bandaged up the axe-wound
and put Mother to bed. Dad went back to the
kitchen with battle in his eye. He got down
his old blunderbuss from over the door and
fed her a large dinner of powder. As I
didn t care about any corpses lying round
the homestead, I felt thankful we had run
out of shot. He filled up the barrel with
coarse salt instead. Then he went hunting.
Jim observed these preparations through a
crack in the wall of the stable. It took him no
more than a second to work out that not only
was Dad going shooting, but that the game
was himself. As Dad had never been of any
account as a shooter of flying game, Jim
decided, after half a second’s thought, that
he’d have a better chance if he got a move
on. So he uttered the howl of his life and
leaped for the next State, which was Vic-
toria.
Dad had a go at him side-on, running, at
a range of forty yards, and he’d more suc-
cess than usual. Because of the quantity
of the charge Jim must have gathered some,
and I noticed it scattered fine. Jim also
scattered. He cleared the wire-netted fence
in his stride, an achievement I didn’t know
he was capable of, and he clamored so loud
that the fowls bolted for shelter. Dad’s
parting words were: “You lazy cow. If
you come near here any more I’ll blow your
head off!” I thought Jim was too busy to
get any of the farewell message, but he
must have got the spirit of it, as he dis-
appeared for years.
That was the first going of Jim. Mother
took it hard for a good while, but I cheered
her up by telling her now and again that I’d
seen someone that met Jim in Queensland'
and that he was doing real well, and in poli-
tics, and likely to be Premier. These were
lies, of course, but they didn’t hurt me much.
I never even heard tidings of Jim for five
years, till I saw in a Sydney paper that
he’d got 18 months’ indoor labor for at-
tempted burglary. Anybody could have told
Jim he’d be too tired for success at that
game.
I burned that paper before Mother could
look at it.
A couple of years after this, bush fires
played havoc with us. House, fences and
crops all went. Everything we had worked
so hard to come by went except the land it-
self.
Then Dad and I sallied forth and helped
Russell to save his belongings, and Dad
worked like three men. The fire had all but
ruined the old man, but lie killed himself
saving Russell. Over-heated and exhausted
he died very suddenly even as he toiled, and
we buried him with little pomp but much
sorrow where the big strong heart of him
would have wished it.
I had to mortgage the land to get a humpy
built, fences replaced and some new farm
implements, and Mother and I had to
struggle like niggers. But we kept gaining.
Mother was a brick, and I told her some
more good lies about Jim. I said he would
soon be Governor.
About one o clock one morning someone
woke me up by knocking at my bedroom
window. It was Jim. The appearance of
him made me out a worse liar than I thought
1 was. He looked more lamentable than a
drought.
“Don’t mind me. Bill!” he said. “I can
camp on the floor if you gimme a blanket!”
and he sat down to take his boots off
I was thinking hard still. Trying to look
sorrowful he kept on : “Awful sorry to hear
about the poor old man goin’ under so sud-
den It was then I struck a plan.
Yes!” I said. “We got burnt right out,
bll t. were getting things a bit ship-shape
again, 111 call the old man to see you.”
hn?Wh e^% Start / d from his head - Ht
had both boots and socks off but he didn't
unpeel any more clothes.
if- i’rPSf’ ain,fc ? ie dead - Bill? Why, I read
ImeM!” PPer SIX months ago—th’ old man,
P ea 4.' rot! That was a false re-
B was corrected a couple of days
T.,! er ' hy, the old man’s as fit as a fiddie.
I ll call him, and I suppose he’ll be glad to
see you ! ’
a “ F ? r P awsak ?,. Bill, don’t talk so loud!
An don t call him, Bill! I’m not stayin’
here. It you ve got any spare brass gimme
enough to get up to Queensland!”
Jims voice had sunk to a gaol whisper.
Meanwhile he stuffed the socks into his
pocket, and slipped his ancient boots on
barebacked. I gave him a pound and he
tiptoed out into the morning darkness.
When he got out I called “What’s up?”
as near the poor old man’s voice as I could.
Then I replied, “It’s Jim come back, Dad.”
. I grabbed the gun and fired both barrels
in the air, and yelled for all I was worth.
By the shout of fear that rang out I think
Jim once again negotiated that fence in his
stride, and the patter of flying footsteps
down the road caused me to fear that he’d
over-run the station by a mile or two.
Mother came out to see what the trouble
was about. I told her the native cats were
at the fowls.
TALYWALKA.
A Song of Grass.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grass is a warrior:
With his sword, with his spear.
He marches through the world
At the springing of the year;
His border is the mountain,
The ocean runs beside,
He takes the winds for Ministers
To bear his pennons wide.
The grass is a traveller:
He wears the nation’s flags;
ITis spirits never weary,
„ His foot never drags ;
Kentucky to the Flinders,
Or Mexico to Perth,
He bears a seed of knowledge
And plants it in the earth.
The grass is a builder:
He builds a city fine;
The beetle runs about its streets,
The ants go line by line;
Its chimneys all so slender
Shine in the morning sun;
And even the little stars come out
To look at them one by one.
The grass is a lover,
A lover strong and warm :
He holds the earth within his clasp,
He holds her with his arm :
‘ Earth, thou shalt never me escape!”
And through eternal years
She bears upon her bosom
The burden of his spears.
