Lysaght: New ways with steel.
W-TW.-
Steel to think about
LY-TEN
The tough one. A versatile steel that
is changing design concepts for trucks,
boats, containers, tractors, rail wagons,
and a variety of other products. Now
they can be made lighter, stronger
than ever before. Because low-cost
LY-TEN sheet steel has far greater
impact resistance than mild steel (or
other metals), and much better resis-
tance to corrosion. It can be cold
worked or welded —either to itself or
any other low-carbon steel sheet. So
get your weight down, get LY-TEN.
Send now for full details on LY-TEN
—the facts could revolutionise your
thinking on the uses of sheet steel.

UP IN SMOKE
WHEN we called on Tom Purves at
the Australian Galleries in Colling-
wood, Melbourne, he was looking very
melancholy. “All I possess is what I
stand up in,” he said. Actually, he was
looking fairly right for a gallery
director, dark slacks, dark blue yacht
squadron pullover with pennant on the
left breast, and open-necked viyella
check shirt.
“I was up at Eildon,” he continued.
“The first that Anne and I heard was
the radio news. It said a three-i'oomed
timber house had burned down in
Molesworth Street. We wondered a
little. Molesworth Street isn’t really
the .type of street that has three-
roomed timber houses.”
He was absolutely right. The house
that burned at 8 a.m. on the Sunday
morning was his own. It was only
finished this year, and the furnishing
had been completed only the previous
Thursday. It was on four levels, was
by Robin Boyd, and was featured in
the “Women’s Weekly” on April 10,
in a large color spread. It was brick,
lined throughout with mountain
ash. “We wanted it this way,” he said,
“so that we could put nails in the
wall. It was an extension of the gallery,
a place for the best paintings, a place
where we could take foreign buyers.”
So when the fire went through it
destroyed over $100,000 worth of
paintings. Purves lost a whole series
of Nolans, Boyds, Tuckers, Percevals,
and pictures by Fred Williams. He lost
a large Tucker of the gambler series
of 1956, two portraits of John Per-
ceval, and a portrait by Tom Woods
finished only the previous week, a
Perceval landscape, an early Nolan
of the Kimberleys, and an Antarctica
Nolan, a large Tucker of the current
1968 series, and a key picture by
Arthur Boyd in the bride series, “The
Captive Bride.” Tom Purves was par-
ticularly distressed about this.
“There’s one odd coincidence,” he
added. “One picture we treasured
was a portrait of Anne by Arthur Boyd,
done eight years ago. Arthur, as you
know, paints very few portraits. Before
the fire he arranged to come back and
paint Anne this morning. She’s sitting
for him right now and that will be -the
first picture of our new collection.”
As for the house, Robin Boyd already
is working on another. Apparently it
will have no timber.
GETTING AFLOAT
TONY GEMENIS, the restaurateur
who’s been given permission to build
Sydney’s first floating restaurant, was
jubilant, but not in a mood to count
chickens after the Maritime Services
Board announced its decision. After all,
he’s spent six years trying to gain
approval for his plan. His first applica-
tion was submitted in 1962 after he
returned from a trip to Europe, and
was rejected by the Woollhara Council,
then he made another one, which was
turned down by the Maritime Services
Board.
Mr. Gemenis, who has owned
Prunier’s restaurant in Double Bay
for the past 21 years, is calling for
tenders for the construction of the
boat, which will be moored next to a
jetty to be built by the Maritime Ser-
vices Board. The plans are already
drawn up, and he is going to spend
$200,000 on the restaurant. Originally
he planned to convert a ferry boat into
a restaurant, but finally decided the
simplest way to satisfy the requirements
of all the authorities involved was to
build a new boat. It will be built on a
pontoon, but shaped like a river boat
with a paddle-wheel in the stern.
Meanwhile, plans for Sydney’s other
floating restaurant are still in limbo.
A company called Harbor Restaurants
Pty. Ltd. have bought the showboat,
the “Sydney Queen,” which, as the
“Kalang,” used to take trippers on day
cruises on the Harbor.
But the “Sydney Queen” languishes
in dock, while Harbor Restaurants
wrangle with the authorities over a
suitable mooring place. Both have
agreed that it should be moored off
North Sydney, but the authorities want
it west of the Harbor Bridge near Luna
Park, while Harbor Restaurants argue
that it is not a suitable place to moor
a vessel. “The water on that side is
50 feet deep,” a director of the com-
pany, Mr. H. S. Whitham says, “and
there is a strong current. We’ve written
to the Minister, and we’re still await-
ing a reply. Certainly the decision in
favor of the other restaurant won’t
affect our plans. There’s room for
two, or even more restaurants on the
Harbor.”
GIVING BALLET A LIFT
FOR THE PAST three weeks
American freelance choreographer John
Butler has been in Sydney with the
Australian Ballet creating his ninth
ballet this year. He has a total of more
than 100 ballets to his credit since
1955. “But this is the first time I have
accepted a commission before seeing
the company I would be working with,”
he said.
“People in Canada whose opinions I
respect told me how much they liked
the Australian Ballet, and I have found
even more than I expected,” he said.
“The company is totally responsive;
full of marvellous enthusiasm.”
Mr. Butler is impressed with the
youth of the Australian Ballet and the
exceptionally strong male element.
Mr. Butler has finally settled on
“Threshold” as the title for his new
25-minute ballet which opens at Her
Majesty’s Theatre in Sydney on August
16, in the second program of the Aus-
tralian Ballet’s 1968 season. It is then
the exclusive property of the company
for the next three years. It is set to two
contemporary musical scores, one by
Durko, a Pole, the other by a Yugo-
slavian woman named Bacewicz. The
“dimensional” decor is by Australian
artist Kenneth Rowell.
A development of a theme he began
with “Ceremony” for the Pennsylvania
Ballet and carried on in “Initiate” for
the Utah Repertory Dance Theatre,
“Threshold” is based on what Mr.
Butler calls “the rehearsal of terror in
the world today.” “The young people
have broken from restrictions but the
freedom they have gained has trapped
them now and they have to find a way
forward. They are desperate to be
together and yet each one is totally
alone there is no communication.
The way out should be a positive love
force rather than a hit, blood thing. But
my ballet is much more abstract than
that. It doesn’t give an answer so much
as a promise hence ‘Threshold’.”
Mr. Butler is based in New York
where he moved from Memphis, Ten-
nessee “the South is almost a waste-
land as far as appreciation and expo-
sure to the arts is concerned.” He got a
scholarship to Martha Graham’s school
of contemporary dance, and later with
the classical School of American Ballet.
After seven years’ dancing with the
Graham company he formed a com-
pany of his own. After a highly success-
ful Broadway debut he toured it
through the Near East and to the Inter-
national Festival in Genoa and the
Holland Fi^tival.

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
playwrights whose work has impressed
him so much only that three have
written plays before, while another is
a novelist and a fifth a Melbourne
radio announcer. But he wasn’t so
reticent about the uses to which Gov-
ernment subsidies should be put. “To
encourage playwrights, above all,
authors should be sent abroad to study
drama, and small theatres should be
given grants against loss, so there’s not
this awful pressure on a playwright to
write a winner first time.
“This should be done before any-
thing before building any new
theatres. Use existing auditoriums. And
I definitely think the National Theatre
should be in Canberra. The auditorium
there is as good as any theatre in the
world. People say Canberra is not a
theatre centre, but. it could be, for
shorter seasons than normal, perhaps,
but it’s definitely possible.”
Bridge, a friend of Googie Withers
and John McCallum, has been in
Australia ostensibly to see their play
“Relatively Speaking” but he is also
interested in the idea of forming a
theatre company of Australia to give
performances here and abroad.
The scheme was first aired earlier
this year by John McCallum, who
announced that he and Bridge would
take an Australian production of Oscar
Wilde’s “An Ideal Husband” to London
next year, then tour Canada and the
United States with it. At that time,
McCallum visualised future productions
mounted in London.
But Bridge, after seeing almost every
play running during his three-week
stay here, thinks the plan may work
better if productions originated here.
“Cne or two names could be brought
out from London, but we could form
the rest of the company here. ‘ldeal
Husband’ depends on cast availability,
but we would create plays of that
calibre—Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward,
and Wilde—a minimum of two plays to
start with.
“I know it’s impertinent of me, an
English impresario, to come out here
and say he could run something like
this. But since I’ve been in Australia,
I’ve spoken to most of the theatre
groups, and I think somehow they
should be channelled into a whole
without the friction between Sydney
and Melbourne.”
Last year, Bridge took two touring
companies to Canada, one to present
“10 Downing Street,” with Alastair Sim
in the lead, the other to do a production
of Noel Coward’s “Hay Fever,” with
Celia Johnson, and it’s been suggested
that he help form a Canadian national
company.
Large, gregarious, and enthusiastic
about everything he’s seen, he says he
now has friends everywhere in Aus-
tralia. “I’ve been enormously impressed,
both by the productions I’ve seen —
especially ‘The Magistrate’ and ‘The
Crucible’ in Melbourne, and ‘Lear’ in
Sydney—and by the size of the
audiences.
“Friday afternoon at 5.30—a packed
house for ‘The Magistrate,’ another
big house at ‘Lear’ on a Saturday after-
noon, and more people than you’d get
at a matinee in London at the lunch-
time plays at the AMP Theatre. The
standard of amateur productions is in-
credibly good—and the standard of
musical talent here, with directors like
Jon Ewing and stars like Nancye Hayes
and Jill Perryman. Australians have no
conception of their own talent.”
And with that, Mr. Bridge was off—
his suitcase bulging with cuttings about
the Australian theatre, and those six
new Australian plays.

There’s a revolution happening in
Europe particularly England
right now. The traditional picture of
a port drinker as a cantankerous old
gouty club dweller is going . . . going
. . . gone. Because the young world
has discovered port. And, what’s
more, the sophisticated young men
and women of Britain have made
Port their favourite drink. It’s not
hard to understand why. And I
believe this will happen here, too,
particularly when there are so many
very good ports available at quite
reasonable prices (our Royal Reserve
Port costs about 80c sometimes
less and is an excellent port.) Why
should you sip a port ? my answer
is that any wine that takes as long to
make as a good port, deserves to be
approached with respect. And sipped
gently and enjoyed to the last sip.
Especially with a dry biscuit before
going to bed.
On the styles of white
table wines.
Notwithstanding the number of dif-
ferent wine brands available, in
On the gentle art of port sipping
Australia we have a wide range of
white table wine types from which to
choose. I would like to quickly enu-
merate them, and briefly describe
the differences so you will have a
better idea of what the names mean
next time you buy a white wine. (Be-
cause I know them best, I have based
these descriptions on the Dalwood
range, but what I say can be broadly
applied to white wines generally).
Dalwood Riesling is light and re-
freshing with a grapey, crisp finish.
Hock is similar, but with a more pro-
nounced bouquet and flavour.
Chablis has a tangy, flinty, character,
while White Burgundy is soft and full
bodied. Other white table wines are
Moselle (like Eden Valley Moselle)
which is light and delicate with a
trace of natural grape sugars, and
Sauterne which is sweeter. If you
like Riesling, you should really try
Minchinbury Rhine Riesling. This is
different to ordinary rieslings,
as it is made from the Rhine
Riesling grape which gives
this wine a pronounced
fruity -flavour that places it
in a class of its own.

mentation” with Victorian children.
The petition will call on the Victorian
Government to safeguard children
from “words, expressions, and phrases
which adults seldom hear and never
use and from warped, biased, and
unnatural sexual notions.”
Mr. Somerville said that the
League was merely acting as agents
for the “very strong and widespread
opinion” which existed on the matter.
He said that the League, which was
backed by Church and community
leaders, such as the two Archbishops
of Melbourne, was not just a negative
organisation. “We have a number of
positive projects. We hope to make
an award to the best family TV pro-
gram and the best TV ad next year.
“We just hate that word negative,”
he added. Did he keep an eye on
pornography? “Yes, I’rp very busy, but
I do try to see the controversial films,
for example. We have to keep abreast
of the current standards of the censor.
The more they fall the harder it would

THE WEATHERMAN'S
TIP ON THE
IDEAL CLIMATE
PEOPLE IN Australia are most
peculiar about climate. The citizens
of Brisbane honestly believe that the
Antarctic Circle runs through the
continent somewhere south of Mur-
willumbah. Whereas here in Melbourne
we know that Brisbane’s climate is
appalling, steaming, mosquito-ridden,
akin to Lae at its worst. We know,
too, that Perth is far too hot, Adelaide
too dry, Hobart too frigid, but cur-
iously enough, the finest climate ever
devised for mankind is right here in
Melbourne a little chilly at times,
perhaps, but that’s what makes us so
clever at acquiring money.
We have just been going carefully
through the statistics. Melbourne is the
second-windiest capital after Perth.
It is the second coldest after Hobart.
It has the least sunshine, an average
of only 5.7 hours. It is the second
driest after Adelaide, yet it has the
second-largest number of wet days, 143,
behind Sydney with 150.
So there you have the picture. We
are cold, windy, gloomy, dry on actual
water but with a sort of perpetual
leaking sky. Actually there are only
three world meteorological centres, two
in the Northern Hemisphere, at Wash-
ington and Moscow, and one in the
Southern Hemisphere, at Melbourne.
One modestly presumed that Mel-
bourne was chosen because of our
superb climate. We simply have more
weather than anyone else. We were
even chosen for this year’s national
“Up till now everybody blamed the
bomb!"
conference of Weather Bureau regional
directors, and while they were here we
provided them with a splendid amount
of weather for them to look at, choppy
seas, constant gale warnings in Port
Phillip Bay, maximum temperature
around 46-47 deg., and winds oriented
almost direct from Mawson Island.
Our Director of Meteorology, and a
Vice-President of the World Meteor-
ology Organisation is Mr. W. J. Gibbs.
He said Moscow was chosen as one
centre because of their huge met. or-
ganisation. “At a stab in the dark I
would say they have 100,000 employed
on weather work and hydrological sur-
veys.” Then, of course, the Americans
were the most advanced in the world,
spending $5O million a year on weather
satellites alone. Washington had to be
a centre. As for Melbourne, we were
simply the most advanced in the South-
ern Hemisphere and, besides, the Aus-
tralian met. headquarters was here, the
CSIRO division was here, and the only
University Met. Department was here.
As part of all this, the Weather
Bureau has just received a $1.9 mil-
lion computer, and another worth $1.4
million will arrive in February. It is
in antiseptic air-conditioned splendor
at the corner of Lonsdale and
Exhibition Streets right opposite the
Comedy Theatre. There is a curious
entertainment tie-up here. The theatre
crowds, when they come out at night,
can push their noses against the big
plate windows of the world weather
centre and look at forecasts being born.
Inside, smoking is utterly forbidden.
Smoke detectors will pick up even the
striking of a match and set off the
fire alarms. The fire brigade is feel-

machine which draws weather maps in
2.5 seconds; in the old days this was
done by hand in 20 minutes.
The most fascinating feature right
now is the computer’s memory capacity.
It can handle the rainfall figures for
10,000 stations for 50 years for 365
days a year. You dial a number, say
Manangatang, and lo!' and on a TV
come Manangatang’s figures year by
year.
Of course, it takes time to feed in
all the information for every tiny place.
But the hometown of the Minister for
the Interior, Mr. Peter Nixon, is there.
Dial 57 and you get the rainfall figures
of Orbost right back to 1883. In a few
years’ time, with the aid of closed-
circuit television, stations in Darwin or,
say, Perth or Adelaide will be able to
plug in and make direct use of the com-
puter.
Ah, but the important thing was to
discover what the computer would do
for weather forecasting. We were
fascinated to note that recently we
received a wrong forecast for the
weather in Melbourne and at the same
time there was a wrong forecast for
the weather for the Test Cricket at
Birmingham—weathermen being human
—12,000 miles apart.
Mr. Gibbs says it will not improve
immediately the accuracy of forecasts.
It will speed up operations, it will en-
able them more quickly to evaluate all
the information from various centres,
including satellites, and to issue more
forecasts. But it will take five years
before they start to get the value of
research from the computer. He said:
“People don’t generally realise that
understanding the problems of the
nuclear physics is the equivalent of
finding a cure for cancer in medicine.”
So one of his problems with the com-
puter is finding the right mathemati-
cians, and the job calls for men with
doctorates.
One wondered whether the computer
could eventually take over everything.
“The Americans have this dream,” said
Mr. Gibbs. “They see the nation cover-
ed with unstaffed automatic weather
stations. These would feed in the in-
formation from read-out stations from
everywhere, even from satellites, and
the computer would be so program-
med that it could use this information
and give automatic forecasts. It would
be very expensive and theoretically
possible. But there is still a flaw. You
still need the highly trained man to
read, understand, and analyse the
information.”
Somehow this was a comforting
thought, and seeing that your cor-
respondent had Australia’s number one
weatherman in a corner it was im-
portant to get reassurance on another
point: Which place had the best
climate in Australia? Where would Mr.
Gibbs choose to retire? He gazed off
into the great cloudy yonder: “Some-
where between Sydney and Brisbane,
I think. An island would be ideal, but
failing that a place right on the New
South Wales north coast.” There it
would be warm in winter, and the

A CLOGMAKER'S
STAND AGAINST THE
MARCH OF TIME
AT NO. 4 Wigan Road, Hindley,
Lancashire’s last dogger, Harry Hurst,
is saying they thought this boom in
clogs’d be a nine-day wonder. First
they kept orders on cards, look, these
filthy things, then young Walter, he’s
coming up to 29, says what we need
is books, Dad. And now Harry and
Walter and Horace turn out 40 pairs
a week in this converted fish-and-chip
shop, thick with 50 years of dirt and
grime.
Clean this lot up, says Walter, and
the place’ll fall down. They did have
a picture of the Queen hanging up-
stairs, but someone took it and
left the frame. Walter went through
a mad phase once and collected Fred
headlines. They’re here, hundreds of
them, yellow with age, over his work-
bench, and a calendar of luscious nudes
which disturb Horace to distraction.
Over there in the corner are Grand-
father Walter’s knives. In those days,
70 years ago, he made his own beech-
wood soles.
“Ho, times have changed,” says
Harry, throwing down a sackful ex-
factory. “You could’ve had any color
upper you liked so long as it was
black.” Now it’s red, green, blue,
brown, anything. “’Ere’s a purr fit to
wear t’ church combination beige
and brown . . .” With fancy button-
tops, 21 shillings children’s, 35/11
women’s, 39/11 men’s. Iron-edged or
rubber, brass studs and tips. There’s
now’t so good for feet as clogs. Bunions,
dropped arches, corns, they clear the
lot. Who wears them? Men in t’fac-
tories, schoolchildren, ladies who know
what’s good for them.
And now they’re exporting. It’s like
this: Harry removes his corduroy hat
and slips into an apron. Where’s his
knife? He moost have his own. Walter’s
put it in the till. It’s like this: A lady
doctor known hereabouts as Mrs. Ryan,
The Clog, gets up at Council meeting
not so long ago and says bring back
the clog for children. And the Wigan
“Observer,” which knows a good story
when it sees one, reports it and follows
up with a feature on Harry with a
lovely picture blown up big.
Then television picks it up. “Righto,”
says Harry one morning at 9, “I’m
ready for you.” Ho, we’re the intro-
duction, say these two young men, the
rest are coming. Well, they pour in
with the clapping-boards, those things
that go smack-smack, put up their arc
lights and wires and things, like Holly-
wood it was, and get Harry to put his
workbench in the middle, for their con-
venience, like, and Harry says, “Hold
on, I’m a busy man. I’ve got no time
for this sort of thing.” It’s all right,
we’re paying you, they said—er ... 15
guineas. “Well, that’s different,” says
Harry, who reckoned the program cost
£lOO, no wonder TV licences are going
up, and that there commentator look-
ing a right fool in clogs and miner’s
knee-cap protectors and him in his
London cravat and all. Money for old
rope, that’s what.
Next thing is the “Daily Mirror”
arrives. They put a fancy model on
Walter’s workbench and get old Jane
Effingham up the road to pose along-
side,. a sort of ancient and modern
with clogs on, says Walter. Then the
letters pour in, we want clogs, write
Wigan-memory-starved migrants from
foreign parts, slightly worn ones will
do, but send them urgent and oblige.
“I am using my clogs on the side-
board as bookends,” writes a lady in
Florida, “everybody asks about them,
this way a conversation starts.” Paper-
weights, doorsteps, they’d make grand
lethal weapons for ladies living on their
own. Walter remembers when men got
into barrels and kicked till the loser
passed out, or on. Like cock-fighting,
sort of. “Eh, Dad,” he cries, “why
don’t we kit the Test Match cricketers
with a purr each?”
It’s past four o’clock and no one’s
done much clogging this afternoon.
Harry’s making, in fits and starts,
a size 2 child’s red clog with strap-top.
There’s now’t to it once you’ve got
your fore-and-aft nails straight. Walter
can’t work and talk at the same time,
something he discovered when he
swallowed a nail. Harry’s friend
Maurice, who’s been in shoes 50 years
and nothing’ll tempt him back, walks
in and says he’s got a sister in Adelaide,
it’s quite nice, and he knows someone
in Perth who says the flies and heat
are horrible. Horace is still out. He’ll
be there, though, for the 70th anniver-
sary. A staff dance, says Walter, all
three of ’em. Gordon arrives for a
running repair. Harry doesn’t hold
with this too often, they start taking
it for granted. On Friday they’ll come
in with their weekend boots and say
no rush, we’ll wait. You’ll wait till
Monday then, says Harry, who’s not
a tough old Tory councillor for noth-
ing. Aye, he enjoys clogging, he’d not
want to change. Unlike some.
There’s a fellow up there trying to
turn Hindley into a garden city, the
gateway of the north he sees it as. “I
ask you,” says Harry, “who wants to,
and if they put us in smart shops my
21-bob clogs’ll cost 30 bob, who’ll pay
that?” So he gets the first plans
quashed. “We’re fighting” he says,
banging in the last nail, “to keep the
place a dump. And we’re winning.”

HASLUCK, FAIRHALL MAY CALL IT A DAY
Comment by Alan Reid
THERE WAS a nostalgic flavor in the
words of External Affairs Minister Paul
Hasluck at last week’s meeting of the
Asian and Pacific Council. He seemed
almost to be reminiscing when speak-
ing about his activities over nearly a
quarter of a century as a diplomat,
parliamentarian, and Minister of the
Crown.
An axiom of politics is that when a
man starts talking about the past he is
contemplating his retirement. If Mr.
Hasluck is contemplating retirement
from politics, it will come as no sur-
prise to many of his colleagues.
Mr. Hasluck cannot be very happy
about the present setup. Prime Minister
John Gorton is not exactly enamored
of the External Affairs Department.
Mr. Gorton dislikes what he has des-
cribed as their “waffling” their “on
the one hand” but “on the other hand”
approach.
Personally, I feel that Mr. Gorton is
a bit harsh. In complex situations
and external affairs these days are very
complex often all a conscientious
officer can do is give both sides of the
problem as he sees it from his expert
viewpoint and leave the politician, who
must carry the responsibility for the
ultimate decision, to make the decision.
One thing is quite clear. There has
been a downgrading of External
Affairs’ role since Mr. Gorton became
Prime Minister. Despite protests, he
took no External Affairs representatives
with him on his trip to the United
States. He relied for his advice on the
Secretary of the Prime Minister’s
Department, Mr. C. L. Hewitt, who, of
necessity, could not be an expert in
the external-affairs field with his previ-
ous experience largely in the Treasury
and Education, and on the Australian
Ambassador in Washington, Sir Keith
Waller, who, though an External
Affairs officer, has had to concentrate
in recent years upon exclusively United
States aspects of external affairs.
I have always felt that possibly with
a wider range of advice—and in saying
that I am in no way denigrating the
abilities of either Hewitt or Waller,
both of whom are highly capable
Mr. Gorton might have avoided the
damaging gaffes for which Opposition
Leader Whitlam so effectively took the
Prime Minister to task in the Parlia-
ment after the United States’ visit.
When Mr. Gorton later went to
South-East Asia, he took with him an
External Affairs officer. But, according
to my colleague Robert Baudino, who
accompanied Mr. Gorton on this trip,
the External Affairs officer clearly
functioned as an organiser for cere-
monial occasions, did the paperwork,
and was not regarded by the Prime
Minister, or any of his personal staff,
as an adviser in the real sense of the
word.
These things cannot be making Mr.
Hasluck too happy, though as a man
of great propriety, with a deep regard
for the principle of joint Cabinet
responsibility, he has maintained pub-
licly an unruffled mien. But he could
have been tilting gently at Mr. Gorton’s
habit of dispensing with External
Affairs’ advice when he emphasised to
the ASPAC conference the necessity for
long and intensive training, both in
politics and external-affairs matters, if
nations wanted to obtain productive
results from their politicians and
advisers.
In a way, Mr. Hasluck, when he pulls
out of politics, will probably do so with
a sense of relief. He has high intelli-
gence, strength, and integrity. My bet
is that if he retires it will be in cir-

With the force of change growing
stronger in today's fast-moving
business world, it is no longer
possible to "make do" with un-

in efficiency and profitability.
For instance, our experts can
after a fact-finding survey plan

cumstances thatl have due regard to
the well-being of | the Government which
he has served since he entered the Par-
liament in 1949. But his sensitivity has
never allowed him to take the rough
with the smooth as philosophically as
many of his fellow parliamentarians do,
and he has never really fitted comfort-
ably into the harsh political environment
which he entered after a diplomatic
career. He has never recognised that
merit in politics, while advantageous,
does not necessarily bring its due reward
but has to be attractively displayed like
a bargain in a shop window. He did
not push his wares during the leadership
struggle, but was disappointed when
Mr. Gorton beat him for the Prime
Ministership. Some of his colleagues
are quite convinced that he will be out
of politics, though not necessarily out
of public life, within a year or by the
next election at the latest. He may go
to Washington as Australian Ambassa-
dor there.
His colleagues claim that he is talk-
ing too wistfully of the books he wants
to write and which he thinks need to
be written—he is a poet and a historian
as well as a politician not be
contemplating retirement within the
reasonably close future.
Mr. Hasluck’s is not the only resigna-
tion that Mr. Gorton could have on his
desk either before or at the next elec-
tion. The resignation of Defence
Minister, Allen Fairhall, is another possi-
bility.
Mr. Fairhall is an unusual parliamen-
tary type. He is an administrator rather
than a politician. The endless intrigues
which fascinate his parliamentary col-
leagues, both Government and Labor,
and which for them is part of the lure
of politics, leave him cold. He is quite
open about the fact that he has stayed
in politics already longer than he in-
tended. He entered Parliament in 1949
during the bank nationalisation flurry
to do a job, not to get involved in
political machinations, and he has stuck
to that attitude ever since.
The recent furore about the business-
men-for-Fairhall move, with the sugges-
tion that Mr. Fairhall should replace
Mr. Gorton as Prime Minister, left him
with a sour taste in his mouth. Most
parliamentarians would have been
amused as well as flattered that even
an insignificant movement would want
them for Prime Minister. Mr. Fairhall
was irritated at the use of his name
without his authority.
A man who prefers fishing to cutting
political bait, Mr. Fairhall would prob-
ably like to call it a parliamentary day.
But he will undoubtedly time his resig-
nation for when it would be least em-
barrassing to the Government and the
Liberal Party.
It would seem, however, that both his
and Mr. Hasluck’s retirement from the
Parliament are possibilities that could
turn into probabilities as the months
inch the Government closer to the next
election.


Mateship
' K
It’s a great thing. An Australian tradition. A spirit of mateship sprang up
between Australians and New Guineans during the second world war and this
spirit runs strong today. Mates help each other. Not out of sympathy, or because
they have to, but as a matter of course, with unhesitating certainty. It’s
mateship that’s led to the grant of as much as $7B million in a single
year to help develop New Guinea so that our tomorrows
will be as great as your todays.
It’s mateship that prompts hundreds of highly skilled Australians, in big demand
at home, to come to New Guinea to pass on their experience and know-how.
The jobs they do are valuable. The training they provide is
invaluable. The positions below need the impetus of Australian polish.

ASPAC: trouble over Japan’s soft line
AUSTRALIA
LAST WEEK’S Canberra meeting of
Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC)
Foreign Ministers saw lines clearly
drawn. It was Japan versus the rest
led by Thailand and Korea.
The Japanese, under the leadership
of Foreign Minister Miki, assumed their
“low posture” at its lowest. “ASPAC is
a regional organisation for mutual
understanding and co-operation,” Mr.
Miki declared at the end of a closed-
session speech. He opposed even discus-
sion of the security problems of the
region: “We have to prepare for peace
and not for war.”
Thailand’s Thanat Khoman had hit
the headlines after the opening session
with a blistering attack on Left-wing
intellectuals in the West: “To them, a
war of conquest becomes a morally
justified war of national liberation,
while the war of resistance to aggres-
sion is illegal and immoral. By demon-
strating and downgrading their own
governments and leaders they ally
themselves with those who uphold and
practise totalitarianism and who deny
even to their own suffering subjects the
most elementary liberties.” He went on
to speak of “an element of racism” in
the view that South-East Asians “are
expendable and may be sacrificed.”
He spoke of an ominous imbalance
of ambitions in the world today: on
the Communist side “the emphasis is on
extension of influence by tightening
the hold on disaffected partners and by
unconditionally supporting struggles
for so-called national liberation,” while
on our side there is “continuous exhor-
tation to disengage.”
On the Vietnam War there was
similar clear division. Taking a French
line, the Japanese said of the Paris
talks that “both countries concerned
are searching seriously for a path which
would lead to an honorable peace,”
while every other delegate spoke of
North Vietnamese obduracy and could
see no progress whatever toward peace.
The Thais said that any “patch-up job”
would be quite unacceptable, and the
Vietnamese laid down a new definition
of their attitude to the talks. Their new
Foreign Minister, Mr. Thanh, said in
closed session that once real negotia-
tions as opposed to the present pre-
liminary talks began, the principals
must be the Governments of North
Vietnam and South Vietnam.
The war was a Vietnamese war and
the Americans were involved at the
invitation of his Government and had
to accede to its wishes in the matter.
Any standstill truce or ceasefire within
South Vietnam would only be accept-
able as part of a final settlement. He
expressed concern at the limits on the
bombing of North Vietnam, and said
the increased infiltration of men and
materials from the North was made
possible by Allied restraint the
strongest hint so far by an official
spokesman of Vietnamese impatience
Australian Prime
Minister Gorton
opening the
conference in
Canberra
last week
with the lack of progress at Paris and
the accompanying bombing halt.
A number of things emerged during
the course of the ASPAC meeting.
India evidently has been making
approaches to join the organisation, but
this has met with discouragement from
several members. They claim first that
India is out of the ASPAC region and
its inclusion would increase too greatly
the potential size of the organisation.
But, secondly, they say that India’s
interest in joining is purely selfish,
wanting to use the organisation as a
lever to open markets for its manu-
factured goods. Thailand, Vietnam,
Taiwan, and Korea also see India as an
obvious ally of “neutralist” Japanese
within ASPAC. And for this reason
they are also reluctant to encourage
Cambodia, Burma, and Indonesia to
apply for membership.
Prime Minister Gorton, who opened
the Council meeting in the Canberra
Theatre, tried to reconcile the demand
for regional self-reliance with a call for
a continued American presence in
Asia. “Ultimately, the future of this
region lies in the hands of the peoples
and countries within it,” he said, but
for the moment, “we must welcome the
support of our major allies.”
He spoke of threats of aggression,
•but conveyed no sense of urgency. Mr.
Hasluck, on the other hand, in a
speech which was a quite different one
from Mr. Gorton’s, referred to “the
great crisis” in the region. Observers
took this difference of appoach plus
the generally nostalgic tone of the
speech and an implicit attack on the
Prime Minister (“even in politics you
need some training before you meet the
great tests of political life”) as a further
indication of his imminent retirement
from the Government.
The final communique was far from
being any easily agreed piece of diplo-
matic guff. The drafting committee
worked late into two nights, and the
Ministers themselves ran long over
their planned time in amending the
agreed draft. Much of it was a matter
of dispute between the Japanese and the
Koreans. There was protracted argu-
ment between them over whether there
should be mention of Northern sabo-
teurs and assassins, and this was only
resolved by Thai and Australian media-
tion. They also argued over references
to China, its acquisition of nuclear
weapons, its bomb-testing, and its sup-
port for insurgency elsewhere in Asia.
The Japanese wanted no mention of
China whatever, and they almost won
through. The approved communique
only carried a waffly reference to
“problems arising out of developments
on the Chinese mainland.” Again there
had been protracted debate with the
Japanese over terminology, the Japan-
ese flatly refusing to approve the term
Communist China and insisting that
there be no reference whatever to any
military challenge it may pose.
On Vietnam the Ministers could
only agree that they “took note of the
present talks in Paris.” The Vietnamese
had wanted as a maximum a declara-
tion that real negotiations must include
the Governments of Hanoi and Saigon
as principals, but they were prepared
to compromise with the weaker state
ment that “the Republic of Vietnan
would naturally play a leading role.”
Previous communiques had madt
plentiful reference to “Communist
aggression and threats” and talked of
the need for “free countries to further
strengthen their solidarity.” There was
no such hard talk this time, largely
through Mr. Miki’s influence, and the
communique was unusually soft.
The next meeting is to be in Tokyo,
and the Japanese Foreign Minister said
he hoped that by then other nations
might have joined: Indonesia, Singa-
pore, Burma, and Cambodia are the
non-Communist nations of the region
which are not yet members. The softer
line was partly for their benefit, but
other delegates speculated that it was
part of Mr. Miki’s domestic politics.
The Japanese Foreign Ministry was
evidently making sure that Japanese
newspaper correspondents didn’t give


Hasluck greets Thanh (r.) and other South Vietnam delegates last week
Thanat Khoman’s hardline speeches
too much coverage. “If that got on to
the front pages, there would be half a
million rioting students at Haneda Air-
port, and don’t forget Mr. Miki is
running for the Prime Ministership.
The Japanese voter doesn’t like people
who provoke riots,” said one Japanese.
Mr. Miki, in an address at the Aus-
tralian National University, spoke
frankly about the restrictions which
pacifist public opinion puts on his
country’s foreign policy. “Idealism and
absolute pacifism are still deeply im-
bedded in the mind of the Japanese
people. Seclusion may well have im-
planted insularism upon the mentality
of the Japanese people. This is a burden
not to be found in other nations, which
the Japanese Government must carry
in the formulation and the execution
of its foreign policy.”
Whatever the reasons, Japanese
behaviour at the conference in Can-
berra was deeply resented by other
delegations. One small Asian nation’s
delegate, asked in the corridor whether
the Japanese were delaying agreement
on the final communique, simply spat
out one word: “Bastards.”
Australia took almost no initiatives
at the meeting, our foreign policy being
in a state of flux. And whereas other
delegations worked closely with the
Press providing briefings, partial
texts, and even tape recordings of their
contributions at the closed sessions
the Australian delegation was instructed
to say nothing at all. Every Foreign
Minister, except Mr. Hasluck, made
himself freely available to the Press,
giving formal and informal Press con-
ferences and speaking to journalists
whenever they had spare time.
The agreement establishing the
ASPAC Cultural Centre was signed
and sealed. Based in Seoul, it will begin
operations within three months. It is
a project the Australian Government is
very keen on. We have agreed to con-
tribute a quarter of the first year’s
operations budget of $160,000. Our
delegates to the Council' meeting
announced that Australia intends to
establish bilateral programs of cultural
exchange with as many Asian coun-
tries as possible, some involving formal
agreements. This follows the first agree-
ment signed with Indonesia on Mr.
Gorton’s recent journey.
Our delegates also sponsored a
clause in the agreement leaving mem-
bership of the Cultural Centre open to
non-members of the ASPAC Council.
In this way, it is hoped that wary
countries like Singapore and Indonesia
may be able to participate in ASPAC
activities without having to take the
larger step of joining the central organ-
isation itself. Or else it might provide
a stepping stone to full membership.
One of ASPAC’s most notable successes
so far in promoting a sense of regional-
ism has been the establishment of
informal “ASPAC caucuses” in inter-
national organisations.
At the UN and at more than 20
international meetings, the standing
committee of ASPAC has arranged for
“prior informal consultations” among
ASPAC delegates. Decisions are, of
course, never binding in the caucus
manner, but the system makes it pos-
sible for delegates to bargain and often
reach some sort of' consensus before-
hand. An “ASPAC bloc” may not be
long in forming.
Meanwhile, in the rush for a pet
ASPAC project to nurse on home terri-
tory between ministerial council meet-
ings Australia has obtained a registry
of services.
The Department of External Affairs
is to provide a Canberra office to base
the director, Australian Mr. J. Wolfe,
and the deputy director, yet to be
appointed from another ASPAC
country. With the aid of a computer,
Wolfe aims to record the names of
experts and the way to get them so
that requests from member countries
for certain technical skills can be passed
to the right quarters.
Wolfe aims to gather information
about experts in four fields initially:
agriculture, forestry, engineering, and
fisheries.
“There is an urgent need in the region
to know who is doing what,” he said
at a briefing on the registry in Canberra
last week. “Often applied research is
in the local language and hence other-
wise inaccessible.”
Wolfe did not, however, expect to
list experts from non-ASPAC countries.
The best he could offer his journalistic
audience was that the registry would
try to co-ordinate with other organisa-
tions to avoid duplication. Meanwhile,
his major worry is to find the informa-
tion, and to store it. “Information sys-
tems can be unwieldy as they grow,”
he said.
So far he has travelled in all ASPAC
countries except New Zealand, where he
is to go shortly. By collating data from
Governments, private organisations, and
universities he aims to direct requests to
sources of data.
Wolfe was unable to say whether or
not the registry’s information would be
available to non-ASPAC members, but
it could be regionalism carried to
absurdity if it is not available both to
private organisations within ASPAC
and to countries outside this latest
definition of regionalism.
ASPAC and N.Z.
HONORARY ASIANS
NEW ZEALAND’S support for non-
proliferation applies not only to nuclear
armaments but to regional organisations
as well, according to New Zealand jour-
nalist Anthony Haas, who was in
Canberra for last week’s ASPAC meet-
ing.
New Zealand’s delegate, L. R.
Adams-Schneider, said he would greet
yet another idea for a small aid and
development program to be considered
as an ASPAC project only after a close
look had been taken at the overlapping
work of other international agencies.
This time Taiwan, which had joined
the scramble for a regional organisation
on its soil, sought a food and fertiliser
technology centre for the Asian and
Pacific region.
Mr. Adams-Schneider, whose inter-
national experience was less than any
other head of mission at ASPAC,
accepted his N.Z. External Affairs
Department brief to seek rationalisation
in the work of the growing crop of so-
called regional organisations. Yet, for
New Zealand, presence at ASPAC was
welcome, for it is the only purely Asian
organisation to define her as an “hon-
orary Asian.”
New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Mr.
Holyoake, has said he would like to
see New Zealand in ASEAN as well as
ASPAC, but sees this only as a long-
term possibility. Although the prolif-
eration of regional groupings is re-
garded as slightly absurd by some
Wellington officials, New Zealand bene-
fits from the fuzzy and changing defini-
tion of “Asian and Pacific regionalism”
because it leaves her free to keep her
European links.
The various ASPAC projects have
provided opportunities for New Zea-
land to do more aid-giving; the instal-
ment announced for the Canberra


gathering was 50,000 N.Z. dollars for
a social and cultural centre at Seoul.
Support for grandiose South Korean
dreams of regional paraphernalia was
politely and conveniently dodged by
New Zealand as she defined her con-
tribution as “modest.” Much of the
contribution will be spent in New
Zealand providing study facilities. Mr.
Adams-Schneider said: “We have it in
mind to make scholarships available in
such subjects as journalism, book pro-
duction, social sciences, broadcasting,
librarianship, art gallery and museum
administration, town planning, and
industrial design.”
The Australian-run ASPAC register
of experts director, Mr. Wolfe, will visit
New Zealand shortly to gather names
for his computer file. New Zealand
skills ought to provide a reasonable
crop of experts for the engineering,
food production, and agriculture inter-
ests of the registry, while it might not
be a bad idea if New Zealand em-
ployed a few of the fishing experts the
registry wants to list.
New Zealand had no big projects to
press at ASPAC after her “modest”
efforts, but according to Mr. Adams-
Schneider he managed to “play quite
a good mediatory role” among delega-
tions. The political push-pull pressures
surrounding nomination of “threats”
in Asia and the preoccupations of Paul
Hasluck as chairman gave Adams-
Schneider the chance to take greater
initiatives than his previous reputation
in international affairs would have
suggested.
The contrast between the low Cabi-
net status of Adams-Schneider, a former
small businessman and lay preacher,
and the other mission leaders, each with
impressive university backgrounds, most
with prominent regional or inter-
national reputations, was marked.
About the only other visible sign of
Adams-Schneider’s presence was New
Zealand support for the nuclear non-
proliferation treaty and Australia’s
hesitation on the subject.
PLANNING
PERTH'S NEW HUB
EVEN IN A STATE that prides itself
on thinking big, Western Australia
Deveiopment Corporation ideas have
been so wayout that most have been
filed in the “too hard” basket. So far,
in five years, the company has done
virtually nothing concrete, but their
ideas and the controversies they have
aroused would fill a fat book. Last
week, for the first time, WADC con-
cepts were given a chance to be
translated into tangible terms. The
Government chose the Corporation
above the two other groups to offer
a $27 million development that will
change Perth radically.
In return for a $7 million job of
sinking the central railway station and
line, WADC (provided their scheme
is approved) will get most of the
WADC’s site for Perth’s underground
35-acre freehold land thus created, as
well as aerial rights for building above
the sunken railway. The other two
groups which tendered were an offshoot
of a giant British organisation and a
consortium of seven firms headed by
Perth engineers J. O. Clough and Son.
Politically it was a hot decision,
made even hotter by the fact that once
again WADC was dealing in that
emotion-packed commodity, Western
Australian land. An earlier scheme in-
volved originally 4-| million acres of
arid land in the south near Balledonia,
where their offer went something like
this: “It’s no good to you and it may
be no good to us. We have resources
to find out if it’s any good to anyone.
If it is, we’d expect some consideration
for proving that it is.”
In the face of such a proposition,
Western Australians began to wonder
was there something about Balledonia
they hadn’t noticed. The area was
whittled back from 4|- million acres
to about one-third of this area, and
even then negotiations bogged down
although they are expected to resume
soon. In fact, there is a strong im-
pression that the rail-sinking project
is a way of WADC proving its talents
and worthiness to take on the Balle-
donia research project. The resources
are considerable. Participating com-
panies include some impressive ones
from Britain, the U.S.A., and Australia.
The rail-sinking scheme entails
building two hotels, a 22-storey office
block, convention and trade centre,
and a shopping complex. Professor
Gordon Stephenson, who is planning
the blueprint for Perth redevelopment,
sees the move as the beginning of a
modern city of Perth calling for
changes progressively over ten to 20
years. But a warning from the “West
Australian” will be taken up by
those who see WADC as another
group of American super-conmen.
Basically the scheme is to allow the
commercial part of the city, hedged
on the south by the Swan River, to
extend northwards around a planned
Cultural Centre.
The newspaper claims ■ “the main
objection is that the proposals do not
take advantage of the unique oppor-
tunity Perth has to redesign its hub
in a way that would give the city
distinction and be an inspiration to
future generations. If that goal is to
be achieved the new design would
have to be related to the Cultural
Centre . . . but the first stage of the
WADC plan has the emphasis on
commercial building . . In the nine
months before definite plans have to
be submitted the Corporation will be
under strong pressure to come up with
a scheme worthy of such unique con-
cepts.
MEDICINE
MAMMOTH TEACH-IN
THE SOMEWHAT military flavor of
the Press briefing last week for the
forthcoming Third Australian Medical
Congress was explained by the presence
of ex-Sandhurst staff officer Colonel
A. G. Hewitt, OC operations for the
largest and most important medical
gathering ever held in Australia.
Colonel Hewitt came to Australia in
1962 for a three-year term as military
adviser to the British High Commis-
sioner in Canberra, followed up with
a pre-retirement duty tour in Singapore,,
and then made a decision against with-
drawal east of Suez in favor of Sydney.
The invitation to his new command as-
full-time organiser came ten months ago
from the host body to the Congress,
the N.S.W. branch of the Australian
Medical Association, which had already
put in 12 months’ work on the gather-
ing which is attracting about 1400
visitors from 25 countries. Many of
them, like South African heart surgeon
Dr. Christiaan Barnard, are the most
eminent specialists in their fields.
The Australian Medical Congress is


usually a less spectacular affair, a trien-
nial meeting which rotates among the
State capitals. But this year it is a
historic event, for associated with it are
joint annual meetings of the AMA and
the BMA, an occasion of robed,
academic splendor in the Sydney Town
Hewitt ...OC operations
Hall on August 12 when Dr. C. O. F.
Rieger, of Adelaide, will be elected
president of the British body for the
next 12 months.
This week has also seen the election
of another South Australian medical
man, Sir Leonard Ross Mallen, as presi-
dent of a separate international confer-
ence currently in session in Sydney, the
22nd World Medical Assembly. The
Assembly meets annually in the country
of the president-elect, and distinguished
visitors attending include Dr. Alfonso
de la Fuente, Madrid, Dr. Gerald D.
Dorman, New York, and Dr. J. Jon-
cheres, Paris.
The larger gathering, the Third
Medical Congress, gets under way on
August 10 with a service in the Great
Synagogue, and an ecumenical service
in the Great Hall of Sydney University
on Sunday. The work starts on August
13 with the opening of a four-day
scientific program during which 260
papers will be presented in from ten to
14 concurrent meetings daily with “live”
sessions being televised on closed-circuit
from the Great Hall to overflow
audiences in lecture theatres in the Uni-
versity’s Carslaw Building.
The conference will get off on the
first day to a more notable start than
the most diligent organising committee
could have foreseen two years ago
when Dr. Christiaan Barnard delivers a
paper on heart transplants. Scheduled
to arrive on August 12 after a 36-hour
flight from South Africa, via Athens, he
faces such a clamor for his time, Press,
radio, television, and social appoint-
ments, that the Press attache of the
South African Ambassador has taken
over the job of sorting things out.
On August 14 the Congress will dis-
cuss the second theme, “How Many
Doctors,” which is concerned with the
quality and number of doctors in the
community. Lord Todd, the Master of
Christ’s College, Cambridge, and latterly
chairman of the Royal Commission on
Medical Education in Britain, will be
an outstanding contributor in this
panel.
Another topic to which events have
given special significance The Pill
will be discussed by five Australian
doctors on the following day.
In the final session, on August 15,
the health of Aboriginal children and
their patterns of intellectual develop-
ment in favorable and unfavorable
environments will be under examination
by another group of Australian doctors.
To give the visitors a break from the
strain of such a mammoth teach-in, the
AMA has organised an equally daunt-
ing social program which includes a
ball, a garden party, a president’s
dinner, sailing, sight-seeing, concerts,
and even invitations to horse racing and
trotting.
QUEENSLAND
FLYING PREMIER
QUEENSLAND’S NEW Premier,
almost certain to be the new Country
Party Leader, Mr. Johannes Bjelke-
Petersen, will take over the Government
this Thursday, amid rumblings of dis-
content from the State Liberal Party.
There was intense behind-the-scenes
manoeuvring last week for the “care-
taker” Premier, Liberal Leader Gordon
Chalk, to continue as Premier at least
until the State elections later this year.
But the Country Party came out with
a flat “no” and the Country Party
has 26 seats in the Coalition Govern-
ment compared with the Liberal Party’s
19.
Mr. Chalk, as Deputy Premier, took
over the “caretaker” Government in
Queensland last Thursday following the
death of Premier Pizzey from a heart
attack on Wednesday night. The new
Premier will be named after the joint
Parties meet this week, but as the
Parliamentary Country Party elected
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen as its new Leader
last Friday night, this virtually made
him the new Premier.
The agreement between the two
Parties when the coalition took power
in 1957 was that the Country Party
would keep the Premiership and the
Liberal Party the Deputy-Premier’s
post. Since then the Liberals have sug-
gested alternating the Premiership, but
nothing has come out of the discussions.
Mr. Pizzey took over on January 17
this year after the retirement of Mr.
(now Sir Francis) Nicklin, and Mr.
Bjelke-Petersen stepped in as Country
Party Deputy-Leader. He had an
absolute majority over the Mines and
Main Roads Minister, Mr. Camm, and
the Education Minister, Mr. Fletcher,
in that election.
Mr. Bjelke (pronounced “Jelka”)-
Petersen is 57, married, with four chil-
dren. He was born in Dannevirke, New
Zealand, but came to Queensland as
a boy, and has spent most of his life
in the Kingaroy district, where he has
agricultural and grazing interests.
He was a pioneer of aerial spraying
in Queensland and operates an aerial-
spraying business which has helped
clear tens of thousands of acres of
brigalow scrub country. He is the only
member of Queensland’s Parliament
with a private pilot’s licence, and flies
his own light aircraft.
Mr. Bjelke-Petersen, an active mem-
ber of the Lutheran Church, won the
seat of Nanango (now Barrambah) in
1947 and has held it ever since. He is
outspoken and once refused a £2OO
salary increase and refused to join a
parliamentary pensions scheme because
it “savors too much of feathering one’s
own nest.” Queensland MPs are now
wondering whether this outlook might

SOUTH AUSTRALIA
LATEST REFORMS
THE PREMIER of South Australia,
Mr. Steele Hall, must surely take this
year’s honors for unpredictable political
moves. When he announced the LCL’s
electoral reform proposals last Thurs-
day, the Opposition could not have been
more surprised and more cautious, for
Hall’s plan—on paper —has made sur-
prising and substantial concessions to
what the ALP had put forward as its
compromise plan. Whether it’s ulti-
mately democratic is arguable, for the
LCL would appear to retain a clear
electoral advantage in the country. But
it would appear that were the ALP to
receive again the 53 percent vote it
won in March this year, it would be re-
turned to power.
The LCL’s original plan was for a
45-seat. House, with 25 city seats
averaging 17,000 voters and 20 country
seats averaging 8500 voters. The new
plan proposes a 47-seat House, one
seat less than in the ALP’s plan, with
an Electoral Commission made up of a
Supreme Court Judge, the Surveyor-
General, and the State Returning Officer
sitting to decide on boundaries follow-
ing the division of enrolled electors bv
47.
The Commission is expected to
recommend either 28 city seats averag-
ing 15,000 voters and 19 country seats
averaging 9200 voters —or 29 city seats
averaging 14,600 voters and 18 country
seats averaging 9700 voters. The plan
would be based on a newly drawn-up
metropolitan area, parts of which are
not yet densely settled. A differential
above and below the quotas would be
allowed, amounting to 10 percent in the
metropolitan area and 15 percent in the
country. The ALP plan had included
an obligatory 10 percent differential in
country areas.
In justifying loaded quotas, Mr. Hall
said that his proposals gave substantially
the same country weighting as existed
in Victoria and New South Wales
country electorates, and considerably
less than in Queensland and Western
Australia. He said he felt the plan
would be acceptable to all Parties and
the electorate in general, though it is
known that many members of his own
Party were not entirely in favor of the
plan, since some sitting Members in
country electorates could lose their seats.
The Opposition Leader, Mr. Don
Dunstan, would not commit himself on
the plan any further than to say that
the concessions made by the LCL were
a start in the right direction, and that
the proposal would be considered in
detail by the appropriate Party com-
mittee. The ALP may, in fact, be pre-
pared to go along with it for reasons of
simple expediency, rather than allow
themselves to appear as intransigent as
they had accused the LCL of being.


JEWISH PRESS
LOST MINORITY
AS THE PROOFS of the August 2
edition of the Melbourne “Jewish
Herald” were being corrected, promi-
nent members of Victorian Jewry were
waiting for the knock of a court bailiff.
Mr. David Lederman, the “Jewish
Herald’s” peppery editor and managing
director, had twice threatened legal
action against members of the Victor-
ian Board of Deputies, following the
resignation of columnist Mark Braham
and drastic loss of advertising from
Jewish subscribers.
While the bailiff was trying to find
solicitor and president of the Zionist
Federation of Australia and New
Zealand. Mr. Nathan Jacobson, who
was out of town, Lederman was apply-
ing the finishing touches to a spirited
article on freedom of the Press. Making
an analogy of the methods of
the Board of Deputies in Melbourne
with those used by the Nazis in the
occupied countries, he charged that
when minority views were suppressed
Jewish life itself was in danger.
After 10 months of rumblings, the
contretemps has developed a number
of facets, but the central issue lies with
Lederman’s publication of Mark
Braham’s column, “As I See It.” For
several months before his resignation
in mid-June, Braham had been express-
ing his concern that modern Zionism,
and its identification with the military
successes of Israel, was weakening the
hold of the spiritual values in the
concept of Judaism.
His theme that Jews were not neces-
sarily Semites had disturbed some
Jewish groups for some time, but when
he levelled criticism against the actions
of Jewish paratroopers in the June war,
and the attitude of many Jews to the
conflict, discontent grew to such a pitch
that the Board of Deputies wrote to
Lederman, asking him to discontinue
the column.
The Board and its public-relations
chairman, diamond dealer Mr. Isi
Leibler, maintain that the demand did
not infringe the freedom of the Press.
They say that there is a difference
between anti-Zionist discussion in a
paper’s open forum, the letters page
or in individual articles, and the
repeated expression of views which are
offensive to a closed community which
is almost unanimously devoutly pro-
Zionist.
Mr. Leibler said the basic fibre of
Jewish beliefs had been attacked by
the column. “I don’t believe a paper
serving a parochial community has a
right of this kind.” Would Catholics
stand for sustained support of abortion
in their Press? he asked.
Mr. Zabludn, a leading executive
member of the Board, denied that the
letter sent to Lederman containing their
request amounted to an abrogation of
free speech. “It would be dangerous,
perhaps, if pressure had been exercised
to put a particular point of view, but
in this case we were merely asking him
to refrain from printing very offensive
material. If he feels that this is a pres-
sure, it must be stressed the Board has
no direct control over the community.
They are free to advertise or not.”
Mr. Lederman’s talent for publicity
has also galled many Deputies. Sensi-
tive about Jewish matters appearing in
the outside community, they have tried
to keep the lid on the pot, insisting that
Mr. Braham’s resignation ended their
quarrel with the “Jewish Herald.”
A call -by a number of organisations
and individuals to Melbourne’s Jewry
to prevent the paper’s demise and to
bring the parties together to sort out
their differences is unlikely to produce
a result.
For more than a month letters have
passed between the Board and Leder-
man, but neither would agree to the
conditions imposed by the other before
a meeting was held. The feeling pro-
Recent “Jewish Herald” front page
duced by the “Jewish Herald’s” frequent
censure of the Board and its senior
officials for not showing true leader-
ship is probably too strong to allow
amicable discussions. It was, in fact,
a rebuke of Mr. Jacobson which
prompted the retaliation which is
now the subject of legal proceedings.
Darker allegations of bad faith, and
attempts to create a cause celebre to
aid circulation will not encourage
reconciliation.
Lederman and his supporters claim
that the Board has merely used the
Braham affair to wage a vendetta
against the paper. They say the old
generation and the nouveau riche
leaders could not stomach the “Jewish
Herald’s” perhaps unsubtle criticism,
and have taken the simple step of killing
a paper which gives an alternative voice
to Jewish life.
Two of Lederman’s strongest allies,
who are both past-editors of the paper,
author Newman Rosenthal and ABC
producer Sam Lipski, take the ground
that the Board’s obtuseness had estab-
lished a vastly wrong-headed precedent,
not only for the life of Jewish journal-
ism in Australia but for the respect of
minority opinion a concern of over-
riding significance to Jews everywhere.
Lipski, who had crushingly dissected
one of Braham’s articles two months
before, charged the Board with “almost
unbelievable stupidity and malice.”
The only gainer from the scandal
appears to be the “Jewish Herald’s”
rival, the “Jewish News,” which has
kept a discreet silence throughout the
rumpus. Decorated resistence fighter
Lederman had perhaps one consolation:
he seemed to be enjoying the fight
immensely, even while losing it.
SIR JOHN CRAWFORD
CRITICISM WITHDRAWN
IT IS unusual for students to defend
a University Vice-Chancellor, particu-
larly if they believe that he is on
the side of law and order, but Sir
John Crawford, Vice-Chancellor of
the Australian National University,,
has had that unusual experience.
On June 12, 1968, Sir John Craw-
ford gave a speech to ANU students.
In it he said no inquiries had been
made to the ANU under a section of
the National Service Act to which
students objected, and he hoped this
would continue to be the position. He
added: “Should it prove otherwise
under new legislation when finally en-
acted, I will decide my own course
of action in the light of any approach
made to me, seeking legal advice and
the views of the University Council
as may seem appropriate.”
Sir John was criticised by, among
others, Alan Reid in The Bulletin for
seeming to claim for himself the right
to be selective in his observance of
the law. But in a letter to the “Can-
berra Times” Mr. Alan Brooks,
president of the ANU Students’"
Representative Council, has now pro-
tested: “Sir John, throughout the year,,
has consistently pointed out that
freedom of speech and action,
especially as far as students are con-
cerned, must be kept within legal
bounds.” Evidence for this includes the
fact that in a copy of the ANU’s
newspaper, “Woroni”, dated March 7,
1968, Sir John was reported as saying:
“Students should exercise their full
rights as citizens to speak their minds,
while recognising that this does not
entitle them to break the law.”
On that basis Alan Reid withdraws
his criticism, although he laments the
ambiguity of Sir John’s June 12 state-
ment and regrets that, in the atmos-
phere of the times, Sir John did not
publicise, in the same forthright terms
as he had previously in “Woroni”,
his view that freedom of speech and
observance of the law were reconcil-
able.


INTERNATIONAL
Dubcek’s trial at the summit
Dubcek, Brezhnev, and Kosygin ... smiles in Bratislava
The sign on a baby carriage in Prague: “Dubcek hold out!”
IF ONLY they knew it—and perhaps
the Bratislava talks may have begun
to convince them of it Alexander
Dubcek is the best man the Russians
have got in Czechoslovakia. Not be-
cause he is their tool: no man has
stood up to Soviet fury more bravely
and steadily than he in defence of
Czechoslovakia’s right to choose her
own course. But because nobody, if not
Dubcek, can keep Czechoslovakia on
that chosen course, which means
Socialism, democracy fit for self-
respecting people, loyalty to the
Warsaw Pact. A Moscow henchman
would merely complete the ruin and
disgrace of Communism which Antonin
Novotny went far to bring about. A
Prague intellectual, a man of reform-
ist theory might already have lost
control and released a total rebellion
against Communism.
, l S ° VI m f aders ° fear f d
that Dubcek would be overthrown by
the democratic torrent he allowed to
flow. Their own blunders have removed
this danger. In the past two weeks.
Alexander Dubcek, the shy and un-
known man without gifts of demagogy,
has become the unchallenged national
leader. If he does not betray this trust
—and is not betrayed by his own col-
leagues in the weeks to come—
his position is assured. Soviet threats,
and his steadfast response to them,
have brought the doubting nation to
his side until men can say, as they do
now in Prague: “If all Communists are
going to be like Dubcek, then I’ll join
the Party.”
In January, when the long leadership
crisis suddenly jerked him into power,
nobody knew quite who he was. The
Czech correspondents in Berlin were
not even sure how to spell his name.
“Good God!” said everybody. “A
Slovak as First Secretary? They must
have been at their wits’ end.”
Now Dubcek is as present and
familiar as beer and sausage to every
Czech and Slovak. His creased-up face,
his nose before launching into a speech,
carry-on as he gets his spectacles astride
his nose before launching into a speech
are a part of everybody’s life. Little is
known about his background, even now.
But some personal qualities come across
instantly.
He is a humble man, with no pre-
tensions. He goes on buzzing about in
his own sma ll Fiat, hobnobbing with
strangers about Soccer (a Slovak pas-
sion), and sitting on his towel signing
autographs at the swimming-pool after
executing his stylish swallow dives. De-
termined to stay in touch, he does
things on television which torture a
sophisticated producer, like leaning for-
ward and saying that he is looking into
a camera i ens but fancying he can see
all the viewers through it.
He makes a habit of thanking the
, , °
people for their support and trust.

Three things seem important in
Alexander Dubcek s past, seen as the
background to a political leader. These
are his connection with Russia, his
overwhelmingly small-town experience,
and the fact that he is Slovak.
As a Communist, he has the non-
dogmatic confidence of a man who is
the son of Communists, has been a
worker, and has never considered being
anything else but a Communist. His
father, Steve Dubcek, emigrated to the
States before World War I, joined the
proto-Communist “Socialist Party of
Illinois” in 1917, and returned in 1921.
Alexander was born in November
that year in the village of Uhrovec,.
in a house which by haunting
coincidence —• was the birthplace of
Slovakia’s greatest hero, the writer and
nationalist Ludovit Stur.
Then they went to Russia Steve
Dubcek, with 300 other idealist Czechs
and Slovaks, joined the “Interhelpo”
co-operative ’ farm near Frunze in
Soviet Asia and Alexander’s first
school was in Kirghizia. They returned
in 1938, when Alexander was 17, and
settled at Trencin in Western Slovakia,
Later, between 1955 and 1958, Alex-
ander was to attend the political school
of the Soviet Central Committee in
Moscow. This unique knowledge of
the Soviet mind and institutions is a
priceless asset today. It is also a
guarantee: though Dubcek knows the
crimes and gigantic mistakes of which
the Soviet Union is capable, he feels
an enduring respect for it.
™ ~ . ,
The small-town aspect is to do with
P 0"- Dohcek is not a weak man. He
J° lned * e P arl V as a " apprentice at
*e Skoda factory at Dubmca, near
Trencin, where he afterwards worked
! n a yf ast factory. He made his way
m small-town politics, becoming Party
ho « >n Banska Bystrica in 1953, in
1958 secretary of the Bratislava
region, and in 1963 already a Mem-
ber of the Praesidium in Prague and
a Member of Parliament First Sec-
retary of the Slovak Communist Party,
As far as can be found out, Dubcek
has never visited the West in his life,
Even in Prague, in the first months, he
felt isolated and unsure. But the West
Slovakian years, in that- intimate yet
hard-fisted kind of politics, taught him
how to handle men who at that
level—might dare to disobey and how
to get things done in a Party apparatus.
His home is still a villa in a Bratislava
suburb, where he goes when he can
and where his blonde wife, Anna, lives


with their three sons, the eldest a medi-
cal student, the others, teenagers, still
at school.
And Dubcek is a Slovak. This fact is
the hinge of the whole Czechoslovak
swing to democracy. His loyalty to this
proud, aggrieved little people who
are the Scots of Czechoslovakia led
him first to fight Novotny for more
Slovak self-government and then,
crucially, to see that Slovak grievances
were only one sector of the whole
nation’s sufferings under dictatorship. In
other words, only a democratic revolu-
tion for all Czechoslovakia could guar-
antee the Slovaks local freedom.
This revelation came slowly. In
1944, he fought as a Communist and
a Slovak patriot in the rising against
the Germans (he was twice wounded in
the leg, and his brother Julius was
killed). Then, in the late 19505, he and
other Slovak leaders fenced with
Novotny for a bigger share of invest-
ment for Slovakia. It was no coincidence
that Trencin was one of the first Party
branches to challenge Novotny.
As First Secretary in Slovakia, Dubcek
at last forged the connection between the
fight for self-government and the fight
for democracy. He allowed Slovak
writers and journalists sensational free-
dom. The crimes of Stalinism were
assailed in Bratislava while Prague was
still silent. The fatal possibility that
the Slovaks would go for autonomy
without bothering about democratic re-
form like a pocket Rumania was
avoided. Thus the alliance between re-
formers and Slovaks which brought
Dubcek to power nationally, and which
really supports the whole Czechoslovak
experiment, became possible.
There was a broad gulf separating
pragmatic Dubcek from the revisionist
theorists in Prague, from intellectuals
who had lived and fought in the West
and developed daring blueprints for
the marriage of Communism and
“bourgeois liberties.” At the outset,
these men doubted if Dubcek really
understood about liberty. Between
January and June, some of them pre-
dicted that the wave of emancipation
would overtake Dubcek and sweep him
away, to replace him by a radical re-
visionist from their own circles.
At first it looked as if they might
be right. In March, Dubcek simply sat
back and let things rip. He told in-
credulous journalists to write what they
liked: television and radio set about
destroying Stalinism on their own. He
told the trade unions that “the cre-
ation and content of union policy lies
in your hands. Neither the Party nor
State wishes or intends to mentor you.”
At first critical, he then promised the
radical reformers an emergency con-
gress, which meant the purge of the
whole leadership. Even the intellectuals
became slightly aghast at what they
were doing.
Dubcek remained almost silent. He
trusted the people not to overdo mat-
ters, and handed them the initiative.
In practice, he was in greater control
than it appeared. But then the Rus-
sians, frenzied with anxiety and egged
on by the panic-stricken East Germans,
brought out the big stick and trans-
formed everything. Armed invasion
threatened. Dubcek came quietly and
firmly forward. The country rallied
to him. The radicals saw, in time, that
Dubcek was the only man who could
save them.
Power lies very heavily upon Alex-
ander Dubcek, because he takes it as
responsibility. Though the communique
from the five-nation Warsaw Pact
summit talks at Bratislava at the
weekend endorsed the national
sovereignty of each country, and Dub-
cek on Sunday twice reassured his
countrymen that nothing agreed at the
talks had been held back from them,
cautious Czechs were fearful that there
might be some slowing down on the
newly taken road to internal reforms.
The Czechs dared to trust Dubcek.
Events will show whether this unpre-
tentious man, Slovak and Communist,
was able to fulfil that trust.
THE PHILIPPINES
ACT OF GOD, AND MAN
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Manila
TWO EVENTS last week may have
serious long-term consequences for the
Philippines: one was the Pope’s encycli-
cal on contraception, the other was the
Manila earthquake. The earthquake
produced immediate shock and grief,
but it may also force changes in the
city’s building methods and standards.
The Philippines is an overwhelmingly
Catholic country and one with an
official population rise of some 35 per
thousand annually.
The extent to which Filipinos are
Catholic is obviously debatable. For
the well off and well educated,
Catholicism obviously is honored more
in form than substance, and the Pill
plus other contraceptives are used. For
the masses it may often only be a
matter of ritual, but the hard fact
remains that continuing adherence to
the rhythm method as part of that
ritual has little if any checking rate
on the high rate of population growth.
In addition, while for the elite the
Senator Manglapus ... setback
Papal announcement was a matter for
much discussion and a little criticism,
for the bulk of the population the
scientific or cynical attitudes of the
rich are outside their world. In short,
the lopsidedly distributed and in-
adequately growing Filipino cake will
continue to have to provide for an ever-
increasing number of mouths.
The average run of politicians for
whom Church support is important will
not play a part in checking this process
whereby the 100-million mark will be
reached well before the end of the
century. For those such as Senator Raul
Manglapus, trying to arouse the Catholic
conscience into a Christian social move-
ment for political change, the encyclical
represents a setback. Manglapus has been
able to use earlier Pauline encyclicals
as weapons against the Filipino intelli-
gentsia’s conservatism. The latest encyc-
lical would seem likely to diminish his
ability to represent Catholicism to that
intelligentsia as a means for social
change and radical action. The stoked
fires will be that much more difficult to-
put out.
Rescue operations continue at Ruby
Towers, the five-storey block of apart-
ments which bore the brunt of last
week’s earthquake in Manila. More than
250 people have been pulled out of the
wreck, but it is evident that a high
proportion will be dug out too late.
Nonetheless, the Army, police, Navy,
and private volunteers continue to work
away, mocked by the older, more dilapi-
dated wooden buildings around them
which did not collapse.
The Ruby Towers disaster was the
worst single outcome of the force-six-to-
seven tremor, on. the international scale
of ten, which was followed by several
force-three tremors and many other
slight ones throughout Friday. On Satur-
day, early in the afternoon, there was
Rescue workers searching for victims of


the violent Manila earthquake
yet another distinct shock of force five
which once again sent occupants of
larger, substantial Manila office or hotel
buildings scurrying into the streets.
Unlike Japan, the Philippines does
not live under the permanent shadow
of earthquakes. Oldtimers were hard
put to it to remember any similar severe
occurrence. Nonetheless, the visual evi-
dence of this earthquake leaves the dis-
tinct impression that in future Filipino
engineers will have to recalculate safety
factors for buildings.
Secretary of Justice Teehankee has
ordered an investigation into the con-
struction of all buildings badly dam-
aged by the quake. The educated
Filipino reaction is that if the investi-
gation is thoroughly carried out some
contractors should cease to be such.
Will the Filipinos gamble on the
law of chance that there will not be
a repeat performance? Or will they
give to this serious problem the care
and attention it will require long after
the immediate human crisis is over?
Thus it was not only nature in the
form of the earthquake but also man
himself in the form of the Papal pro-
nouncement which illustrated last
week that Filipino stability looks like
remaining too much subject to unpre-
dictable forces. In ironic contrast,
therefore, was the warm welcome
accorded the first-ever 17-man goodwill
delegation from the country which sees
both revolutionary fires and* scientific
interference with the transmission of
life as being to its advantage. The
Russian delegation naturally included
a flawless speaker of Tagalog, the
Philippines national language, remind-
ing that Moscow hadn’t forgotten its
blueprint.
In passing, if there was any expres-
sion of the Australian Government’s or
people’s concern and sympathy for
their neighbor’s tragedy and distress
following the earthquake, then I failed
to see it reported. One small further
opportunity lost to assert that we care
about the part of the world in which
we are placed?
CHINA
MAO STAYS MUM
CHINA’S long, hot summer of confused
violence, to which trussed and mutilated
corpses fished out of Hong Kong waters
have borne grim witness, is itself brutal
evidence of Mao Tse Tung’s withered
political power, analysts point out today.
In 1966, alarmed that the Chinese
structure of Party and administration
might ossify into a new self-seeking
mandarinate and that the pure urge
toward the ideal classless society would
die, Mao launched the masses against
his own established Communist hier-
archy in the “cultural revolution.”
But the new organs of egalitarian
government, the “three-way” provincial
revolutionary committees, since formed
with difficulty in all but five key frontier
provinces of China, have themselves
tended to harden into closed bureaucra-
cies. In most cases they are dominated
by local military leaders and rehabili-
tated Communist cadres of the old
hierarchy.
The original conflict between the
amateurs and professionals, the idealists
who wanted to destroy all at once in
order to build a new classless Paradise
and the steady-does-it pragmatists of
the Communist Party, has therefore
been converted into a power struggle
between the haves on the revolutionary
committee and the have-not revolution-
ary rebels largely left out in the cold.
In theory, Mao, whose thoughts are
gospel, could still quell the destructive
storm over China by personally making
his wishes and precise intentions clear.
But he stays silent. Mao dare not com-
mit himself too openly, experts say,
because opposition to his mass-line
dogma is too widespread and strong. He
wins his support by wheeling and deal-
ing privately, it seems, suiting his words
to his man.
In consequence, at provincial level
rival factions all claim to be the true
interpreters of Mao’s disembodied “in-
structions,” which they adapt to their
own particular line in the scrimmage
for local supremacy.
This leaves “Maoist” and “Maoist” at
each others’ throats, and, in the past
two months, bitter fighting has been
reported from eight provinces and
autonomous regions of China, especi-
ally in the rebellious deep south, where
men are notoriously Nelson-eyed about
Peking’s signals. In Kwangsi Province
warring mobs struggling viciously for
control of the towns with machine-guns,
mortars, and grenades have been sup-
ported by rival factions within the
Army itself, but “revolutionary rebels”
supporting the local military authority
have understandably received the most
military aid and appear to have
smashed the “grand army” of Left-
wing Red Guards loyal to Peking.
Thousands of refugees have poured east-
ward into neighboring Kwangtung
Province ' and its capital at Canton,
where one visitor has described seeing-
hundreds of bloated bodies of defeated
and murdered “Maoists” which had
drifted down the river from KwangsL
Canton is no haven, however. Schools
and even many police stations are shut
and hospitals have been commandeered
by Red Guards. The refuse piles high
in the streets and sporadic food short-
ages send prices out of reach of dis-
contented workers who are on half-pay,
because their factories are too often the
settings for savage skirmishes between
armed rebels and provide work only
intermittently. Throughout the pro-
vince, floods have aggravated the chaos,
an influenza epidemic threatens, and in
the towns thousands queue outside de-
nuded pharmacies, eye-witnesses say. A
curfew has been imposed in Canton and
some fear a complete breakdown of
public order.
In this monstrous projection of
medieval lawlessness, a city of three
million is divided between ideological
Montague and Capulet. And the Army
rarely intervenes, when hundreds, and
even thousands of rival Red revolution-
aries fight it out with everything from
bottles and bicycle chains to modern
automatic weapons seized from the
soldiers themselves.
Mao has reputedly declared that
China is paying a “high price” for cul-
tural revolutions which may take 15
years to “consolidate.” But the silence
prompted by his own weakness is one
of the most expensive items on the bill.
UNITED STATES
NOT "RIFF-RAFF" RIOTS
THE URBAN RIOTS of America’s
long, hot summers are a form of social
protest by non-criminal elements and
are justified as such by a majority of
American Negroes.
• The National Advisory Commission
on Civil Disorders has now issued
three studies, supplementing its major
report to the President last February,
which suggested that future riots could
be prevented, not through massive sup-
pression and police action but by
transforming the Negro slums and the
institutions and attitudes that have
created them.
President Johnson appointed the
eleven-man commission a year ago to
find the causes of the 1967 riots in
the cities, and to recommend solu-
tions. After extensive investigation, the
commission found that the United
States was moving toward “two
societies, one black, one white
separate and unequal,” and laid the
blame for the trend on “white racism.”
It also made sweeping recommendations


National
Guards
called out in
the latest
flare-up of
racial
violence in
Cleveland,
Detroit
for changes in law enforcement, wel-
fare payments, employment, education,
and coverage of riots by the news
media.
One of the studies released by the
commission last week repudiated the
“riff-raff theory” of riots, which con-
tends that only a small fraction of
the Negro population participates, and
that the vast “respectable” majority
deplores the violence. The second
study showed that a majority of
Negroes still desired integration with
whites, but many others had lost faith
in the American system and were
listening to militant leaders advocating
violence and separatism. The third
study disclosed that white-owned busi-
nesses, the police, and other institutions
serving the Negro slums were frequent-
ly insensitive to the needs of the people
living there.
The studies pointed out that the
riff-raff theory was widely accepted
because it was reassuring to most white
Americans. However, after examina-
tion of 10,000 arrest records in ten
cities the commission found:
• Instead of only one or two percent
of the Negro community actively par-
ticipating in riots, as generally believed,
the average participation was 18 per-
cent.
• Rioters were not “riff-raff” or
outside agitators but were representa-
tive of the young-adult Negro males
in the ghetto.
• The overwhelming majority of
rioters were employed. About three-
fourths of those arrested had jobs.
• More than two-thirds of those
arrested were adults over eighteen.
Ninety percent of those arrested were
males. However, many females rioted
without being arrested because of police
leriiency.
The studies concluded that the 1967
riots were carried out by a “small but
significant minority of the Negro popu-
lation, fairly representative of the
ghetto residents, and tacitly supported
by at least a large minority of the
black community.”
BIAFRA
IS THERE STILL WORSE?
THE HIDEOUS situation in Biafra
grows steadily uglier. With something
like 3000 people believed to be dying
every day from starvation or malnutri-
tion, the hopes of bringing in adequate
food supplies have receded yet further.
At the recent talks between Biafran and
Nigerian leaders in Niamey, General
Gowon seemed to have given way to his
most hawkish advisers. He turned down
the routes for land corridors that the
Biafrans had suggested, insisting instead
that all relief should go along the road
from Enugu into Biafran territory. This
road is still disputed territory; there has
been heavy fighting along it; its surface,
in the Ibo-held sector, is very poor; and
it is certainly not the best route avail-
able. In the talks this week at Addis
Ababa, the Nigerians forced the Biafrans
to agree that relief should be discussed
only after a political settlement and a
ceasefire had been agreed.
The Nigerian attitude may reflect
General Gowon’s fear that he will not
be able to hold back his regional com-
manders for much longer. There has
been an increase in the fighting north
of Port Harcourt and it appears that
federal forces are preparing to attack
Owerri, one of the three towns still in
Ibo hands. This could mean that the
fiery Nigerian commander in the Port
Harcourt area, Colonel Adekunle, has
decided to anticipate orders to attack
the Biafran heartland.
There are several signs that a general
assault on Biafra may not be far away.
The Nigerians have indicated that they
intend to keep 50,000 of their 75,000
soldiers under arms after the* war is
over. This could mean that they have
decided they will need a long-term army
of occupation in Ibo territory once they
have captured the strategic points. It
could be just a way of substituting under-
employment for unemployment. But
taken with the comments of the Nigerian
“Daily Times,” which often reflects
official views and which proclaimed last
week that the only way out was “to
bring Ojukwu to his knees in the theatre
of war and not at the conference table,”
it sounds ominously suggestive.
If there were an invasion many of the
people in the refugee camps would flee
into the bush, there would be prolonged
and bitter fighting, and it seems un-
likely that the Army would help. It
would need all the transport it posses-
ses, and would not welcome relief work
which might get in the way. Colonel
Adekunle has already said that relief
should be handled by the Army and
not by the Red Cross. As it is, the Red
Cross is having difficulties in finding
drivers willing to brave the dangers
of ambush on the Enugu road. If there
were renewed large-scale fighting, it
might be impossible to find drivers
willing to take on the job even
assuming that the Red Cross were
allowed to operate.
Some Nigerians have been saying
that the Federal Army has a duty to
invade the heartland to put an end
to the starvation. In practice an
invasion would increase the suffering.
Whatever happens, a very large num-
ber of people are dying in Biafra. If
the Nigerians invade, the number will
be even greater.
JAPAN
THE LESSER EVIL
FOR YEARS the Americans have been
trying to get a “sensible” public de-
bate of defence issues in Japan. Now
they have got it. But the snag is that
the reappraisal in Tokyo looks like
coming to conclusions very different
from Washington’s own.
America’s conventional mythology
about Japan has assumed that, if only
the emotional Left could be neutra-
lised, all Right-thinking Japanese
would realise that their own security
interests dovetail neatly with American
policy in Asia. Japan would play a
more forward political role counter-
balancing China; it would also take on
a greater share of the economic and
military burdens of keeping the peace.
Most Japanese, outside the Defence
Agency and the Right Wing of the
Liberal-Democratic Party, see little
merit in a massive build-up of con-
ventional arms. As it is, the Army
cannot recruit enough volunteers to
keep up to strength. There might be
a case for a stronger Navy since Japan’s
lifelines for fuel and raw materials are
long. But that is all.
The Japanese now spend only 7-8
percent of total government spending
(or roughly 1 percent of their GNP)
on all three Services. Nearly half of
this sum is offset by direct Ameri-
can defence spending in Japan. No
politician wants to advocate cuts in
overdue spending on social welfare or
an increase in taxes to finance more
guns. The American presence is much
the lesser evil on the political un-
popularity scales.
Besides, the Japanese cannot think
what they would do with a beefed-up
Army. Few Japanese can conceive of
an unprovoked direct attack on their
islands by China or Russia. And they
fear that Japanese entanglement in
foreign military alliances would act
more as a lightning rod than as an
umbrella. The commitment to provide
Japanese soil for American bases
in the China containment game is
risky enough. A commitment to pro-
vide Japanese troops in an Asian war
is almost unthinkable. When the Thai
Prime Minister visited Tokyo recently

Japan out of any plan to extend existing
regional economic and political co-
operation into the defence sphere.
The Americans argue that, even if
Japan insists on keeping its boys at
home, it needs to build up its con-
ventional forces simply to defend its
own territory adequately. Most Japanese
do not accept that this argument
applies to a nation of islands about
12 minutes from China as a missile
flies. Ultimately, they counter, Japan’s
safety must depend on political good
sense and on nuclear deterrence.
Those who go on to argue that
Japan should have its own deterrent
are in a small minority. In theory,
Japan could develop a bomb in one
or two years, a creditable delivery
system in perhaps five. In practice,
the problems of expense, of securing
fuel supplies, even of finding enough
scientists both able and willing to
work on such a project would be for-
midable. Yet it would be a mistake to
dismiss the nuclear fringe completely.
Japan’s so-called “nuclear allergy” may
not be permanent.
It is still suicide for a politician to
envisage nuclear arms in public. Mr.
Kurashi, the former Minister of Agri-
culture, was forced out of office in
February for making just that mistake.
But observers are arguing the case and
getting space in journals which were
formerly the preserve of pacifists.
More surprising, a recent survey
showed that even in progressive Tokyo
21.2 percent of those questioned sup-
ported the proposition that Japan
should have nuclear arms.
Barring an unexpected disaster, most
Japanese still look to the. American
nuclear umbrella, and ultimately to the
emergence of a stable three-way nuclear
stalemate between America, Russia, and
China, for their insurance policy. The
point worrying the Americans is that
many Japanese reckon that continued
reliance on America’s -nuclear umbrella
does not presuppose continued unquali-
fied support for the present America-
Japan Security Treaty. Some sort of
treaty link is desirable. But the 46
American bases and 38,000 servicemen
in Japan may not be.
In the short term, the Japanese Gov-
ernment’s stated policy is simply to
allow the security treaty with the
United States to run on automatically
after 1970. Last month’s Upper House
elections in which the ruling party lost
only one seat while their leading rivals,
the Socialists, lost seven suggests that
most people are realistic enough to
accept this. But, in the longer term,
pressure for some loosening of defence
ties with America seems bound to grow.
Newly affluent and confident, most
Japanese want more room to assert
themselves after two decades of suffo-
cating American tutelage. An increasing
number, inside as well as outside govern-
ment, argue that a reduction in
America’s permanent military presence
on Japanese soil would not only
remove much of the present friction
between Americans and Japanese, and
the deeper fear that the Americans
might involve Japan in a disastrous
quarrel not of its own making. It
would also increase Tokyo’s chances of
wooing Peking into more reasonable
relations with its neighbors.
The Americans are not entirely unre-
sponsive to this line of argument. They
recognise that there is a strong political
case for removing some of the bases
that have become engulfed by Japan’s
urban sprawl. It is also probable that
when the Vietnam War ends the return
of Okinawa will be negotiated swiftly
and relatively smoothly. It would be
difficult for the Americans to give up
their rights to use the bases there as
needed; but they could offer to remove
the nuclear irritant. In the end, Wash-
ington, too, may decide that a stable,
prosperous, and more independent
Japan might be a more useful friend
than one more closely allied and heavily
armed.

The Pope and the Pill
Pope Paul moves through summer holidaymakers at Castelgandolfo a few days before his encyclical was issued
By IVAN YATES
THE POPE’S pronouncement on con-
traception took many Catholics by sur-
prise. Even men who prided themselves
on their skill at the doubtful science of
vaticanology were caught out. Partly, no
doubt, the shock was the result of wish-
ful thinking: many had been praying
that some relaxation would be made
in the rigor of the Church’s traditional
teaching on birth control, and, naturally,
they were accustomed to believe in the
efficacy of prayer.
Partly, it had come to seem almost
inconceivable that such prolonged study
and heart-searching could yield so nega-
tive a result. It is more than five years
since Pope John set up his commission
of experts, which grew to be 50 strong,
composed of priests and laymen, includ-
ing married couples. That commission
reported two years ago, by a large
majority, in favor of change. Even the
16 or so cardinals and bishops whom
Pope Paul had added to the original
members accepted the case for change
by a smaller, but still substantial,
majority.
No one maintains that the Pope was
obliged to accept the commission’s con-
clusion because it had a majority on
its side. Like doctors and lawyers, theo-
logians, and even bishops, are, in cir-
cumstances like these, commissioned to
give expert advice which it always
remains the right of the person who
asks for it to accept or reject. But many
Catholics did expect that if the majority
report were to be turned down, at least
some new and convincing grounds for
its rejection would be put forward.
That is to put the problem in secular,
or at least lay, terms. But, more import-
ant, two opposed ideas of the Church
itself seem to be involved two differ-
ent “ecclesiologies,” to use theologians’
jargon. One is based on the First
Vatican Council of 1870 with its high
doctrine of the Papacy and Papal infal-
libility: it can appeal to the fact that
the Second Vatican Council in this
decade repeated the conclusions of
Vatican I about the place of the Papacy
in the Church. There is no disputing
that, juridically, the Pope was perfectly
free to act as he has done.
But Vatican II led many Catholics
to expect that the actual exercise of the
Pope’s “Magisterium” or teaching office
would be very different. For it placed
the primacy of the Pope in the context
first of the whole people of God and,
secondly, in that of the “collegiality”
of all the bishops. Quite apart from its
content, therefore, the encyclical
“Humanae Vitae” has disappointed
many Catholics, because it seems to fly
in the face of the whole spirit of Pope
John’s great council.
It is this dangerous mix of high-
handed, almost authoritarian method of
decision, perfunctory, almost dismissive
treatment of argument with the desper-
ate importance of the subject-matter,
that has detonated the explosion in the
Catholic world and far beyond. A dis-
tinguished Catholic laywoman believes
70 percent of Catholics will reject the
encyclical. An experienced priest gives
it a life of five years at the most. Anyone
who has talked recently to young semin-
arians at the English College in Rome
knows they will have none of it.
Yet this is the action of a Pope who,
at his election in 1963, was the chosen
candidate of the progressive cardinals,
who had won a reputation for himself
earlier at Milan as a modern-minded,
outward-looking prelate, who has
pioneered the new tradition of papal
journeys to distant parts of the world
and personally involved himself with
Vietnam and Biafra, who in many ways
has carried forward the work of reform
and renewal which won for Pope John
his great reputation. He has retired
bishops, begun to reform the Roman
Curia, and got rid, one by one, of the
extravagances and archaisms in the
Vatican.
How does one explain this combina-
tion of reform and reaction? Com-
parison has been drawn between
Anthony Eden following the great
Churchill, and Paul succeeding Pope
John. Just as Eden was needled by


criticism of his weakness and hesita-
tions, so Paul, tortured by indecision,
was publicly dubbed “Amletico,”
Hamlet-like. Both men, it is claimed,
reacted by choosing the wrong issue on
which to stand and fight. By this token,
contraception is Pope Paul’s Suez.
It is a suggestive parallel, but it does
not fit the facts. The evidence shows
that Pope Paul’s encyclical was not the
product of petulance but of. deep, pro-
longed agony of mind. By all accounts
there were drafts in existence before
last autumn’s synod of bishops met. At
that time, reports suggested that they
included passages of casuistry about the
Noted theologian Monsignor Ferdinando Lambruschini discusses the encyclical at
a Press conference in Rome
Pill which were certainly omitted from
last week’s document. At least three
West European cardinals, Suenens, of
Malines-Brussels, Doepfner, of Munich,
and Koenig, of Vienna, have pleaded
with the Pope in the past 12 months
not to issue his draft. Cardinal Suenens,
in particular, has told friends he sent a
warning letter to the Pope in stronger
terms than he had ever thought it right
to issue before. But although all three
cardinals had every opportunity to put
their case when they were in Rome,
they were obviously not in such a fav-
orable position as those who were there
all day every day, working within the
Curia in a Byzantine atmosphere of
intrigue and secrecy.
Last week’s issue of the encyclical
brought serenity to its author—assum-
ing, for the moment, that the Pope was
its author. Indeed, the Pope should
be paid the compliment of sincerity and
should be acquitted of ignoring advice.
He merely rejected it. Does this mean,
then, that his liberal period is over?
That he has decided, looking around
the world, that enough is enough? His
references in the encyclical to “every
form of pornography and licentious
performances” and his known fear of
the introduction into Italian law of the
right to divorce suggest, certainly, that,
like Malcolm Muggeridge, he thinks it
is time to stop the rot.
“What is more, this change would
inflict a grave blow on the teaching
about the assistance of the Holy
Spirit.” The report recalled that in
1930 Pope Pius Xl’s encyclical on
birth control, “Casti Connubi?,” was
put forward in direct opposition to the
permissive attitude of the same year’s
Lambeth Conference of Anglican
Bishops by the church “to whom God
has entrusted the defence of the integ-
rity and purity of morals. Is it now
to be admitted,” it asked, “that the
Church erred in this her work and
that the Holy Spirit rather assists the
Anglican Church?” Perish the thought!
If this stood entirely on its own, one
might put it down to a blind spot in
his make-up. The first mistake was
not his: the decision to reserve the
subject of birth control for the Pope
alone. This did not prevent several
speeches calling for reform during the
debate on marriage at the Vatican
Council in November, 1964. Cardinal
Suenens, calling for account to be
taken of the “new insights of modern
science,” said: “We have made some
progress since Aristotle. I beg you,
my brothers: let us avoid a new
Galileo case. One is enough for the
Church.”
To cap this, the 88-year-old patriarch
Maximos of Antioch described the
regulation of birth as “an urgent prob-
lem if ever there was one, since it is
at the bottom of a grave crisis of the
Catholic conscience.” It was a question,
he said, of a lack of alignment between
the official doctrine of the Church
and the contrary pratice of the
immense majority of Christian couples.
“Frankly,” he went on, “ought not
the official positions of the Church on
this matter to be revised in the light
of modern science, both theological
and medical, psychological and socio-
logical? And are we not in the right
to ask ourselves if certain official posi-
tions are not to be attributed to out-
dated conceptions and perhaps also to
a psychosis of celibates who are
strangers to this sector of life?”
But the issue of birth control does
not stand on its own. Last week’s
encyclical follows the Pope’s action
recently in publishing a credo, closing
the official year of faith, This was a
highly conservative statement of dogma
which caused as much pain at Uppsala,,
where the World Council of Churches
was meeting, as last week’s encyclical
did at the Lambeth Conference of
Anglican bishops in London. These two-
incidents, taken together, make it seem
more likely that we have, in the pres-
ent Pope, a man who is naturally con-
servative where morals and doctrine
are concerned, but liberal in action and
in his political attitude to the modern
world.
This is, by no means, an improbable
combination. People often fail to realise
that Pope John, too, was a natural con-
servative in matters of faith, but also,
like Paul, bold and modern in his
administrative methods and conventions
and in his attitude to Communism.
This is not to say that Pope John
would have made Paul’s decision over
birth control. Their personalties were
very different: Paul, intellectual, intro-
verted, a patrician without the common
touch; John, all peasant shrewdness,
jolly, extrovert. John might well have
been content to leave the issue of con-
traception to the council, which was
his creation, and he would, surely, have
been humbler in the face of his expert
commission’s recommendations. Paul’s
very intellectual power, which is con-
siderable, must have made him that
much readier to overrule the experts.
Moreover, there was another impor-
tant difference in the respective experi-
ence of the two Popes. John had been
for most of his life a diplomat in dif-
ferent parts of the world. Paul had
spent most of his career in the Roman
Curia, much of it in the service of
Pope Pius, a man of the old school
with a high view of the place of the
Papacy. And it must not be forgotten
that behind last week’s encyclical lies
not only a pious Italian priest’s view
of sex and its temptations, but also a
question of authority. The minority
report, which advocated no change in
the position of the Church on birth
control, was even more concerned with
authority than sex.
It was signed by four theologians,
three of them Jesuits, and it took the
simple line that contraception was
always seriously evil and the Church
could not change its attitude because
it was right. But it went on from
there to assert that “if the Church


should now admit that the teaching
passed on is no longer of value, teach-
ing which has been preached and
stated with ever more insistent solemn-
ity until very recent years, it must be
feared greatly that its authority in
almost all moral and dogmatic matters
will be seriously harmed.
It is difficult not to feel that this
sort of argument must have had con-
siderable appeal for Pope Paul. For,
in effect, it was saying that if you
alter the line on contraception, the
position of papacy will be under-
mined. The irony is that, by not alter-
ing it, Pope Paul has achieved exactly
the same result. The particular delicacy
of his position is that if he had followed
the majority of his advisers he would
be overturning not, as one might think,
a very ancient authority of the Church,
which could, no doubt, more easily
have been ascribed to circumstances
which have now altered, but a very
modern one. There is little warrant
in scripture or in the early fathers of
the Church or in its general councils
for a ban on contraception. Certainly,
the Pope quotes none in his encyclical.
But there is Pope Pius’ encyclical in
1930, and there are twentieth-century
statements of national groups of
bishops, German, French, American,
Indian, and British. The Pope himself
issued a pastoral letter on the subject
in 1960 when he was Archbishop of
Milan.
In taking this uncompromising line,
moreover, the Pope was merely match-
ing an old-fashioned theology to his old-
fashioned ecclesiology. It is a scholastic
theology, operating quite outside time,
and demanding always an inner con-
sistency and coherence. In his
encyclical, the Pope refers specifically
to the Church being “coherent” with
itself. More modern theologians see
the Church, rather, as a pilgrim through
time, responding to change with change
and unworried by the process.
The Pope’s own advisers, in their
majority report, echoed this theology
when they wrote: “There is then no
sound basis for fearing that change
would cause a loss of trust in the
Church’s teaching authority or would
make it possible to raise doubts on
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Ramsay, addresses the Lambeth Conference.
The encyclical coincided with the conference
every other doctrine. Such a change
is to be seen rather as a step forward
toward a more mature comprehension
of the whole doctrine of the Church.
Doubt and reconsideration are quite
reasonable when proper reasons for
doubt and reconsideration occur.”
The Church teaches that papal pro-
nouncements are infallible only when
they are specifically defined as such,
and, in fact, at most two have been
so defined. Encyclicals like Pope Paul’s
on contraception are said to be
“authentic,” according to the old
ecclesiology. They demand religious
assent or, if that is impossible for any-
one, at least “obsequious silence.”
Nowadays, in the present crisis of
authority, they are more likely to
receive outspoken protest.
The Pqpe’s advisers gave some justi-
fication for this when they wrote: “In
recent decades there has been an
increasing tendency to consider the
authentic, non-infallible magisterium
infallible in practice, whereas in reality
it must be expected that the non-infal-
lible magisterium is sometimes mis-
taken.” In fact, in the past, encyclicals
have become dead letters in the course
of time. Religious liberty was
anathematised in one 19th-century
example; now the concept has been
blessed by the Vatican Council. Dur-
ing World War II an encyclical
equated membership of the ’Roman
Catholic Church with being “in the
body of Christ.”
What, then, will happen to Pope
Paul's latest offering? Its life is limited
in time, certainly, and the trend toward
public protest will surely shorten it. Is
five years a conservative estimate? Does
it matter much, anyway, if it proves to
be more honored in the breach than
the observance? Will the next session
of the Synod of Bishops take the matter
up? Or the standing theological com-
mission promised by the last synod? Or
is it too much to expect that bishops
and bishops’ men will press for reform?
Will it be left to those most closely
concerned, lay men and women, to-
assert themselves?
Last year a conference of the lay
apostolate in Rome passed a resolution
recording “the very strong feeling among
Christian lay people that there is need
for a clear stand by the teaching
authorities of the Church which would
focus on fundamental moral and spiri-
tual values, while leaving the choice of
scientific and technical means for achiev-
ing responsible parenthood to parents-
acting in accordance with their Christian
faith and on the basis of medical and
scientific consultation.”
It seems inescapable that this rebellion
against Papal authority will divide even
more sharply different parts of the
Catholic woxld from one another:
Catholic countries in Europe and some
of the missionary areas in other con-
tinents will go one way; advanced
Western countries, particularly those
with strong Protestant and democratic
traditions, will go another. The trend
toward “National Catholicisms” has-
been subtly fostered by the decision
everywhere to hold the Mass in the
vernacular. Now it must be accelerated.
In some sense, this is a return to an
earlier tradition. It is really only since
the middle of the last century, following-
the revolutions in Europe, that the
Papacy has been put on a pinnacle of
unchallenged authority.
How will it all end? In schism? Or
in breakaways? Or will genuine col-
legial government be established within
the world-wide Church in time? What-
ever fate is in store for the Catholic
Church, the debate over contraception
will flourish and, following the Pope’s:
example, will increasingly extend to the
nature of authority. Perhaps the
crunch will come when the Pope re-
tires and a new conclave meets to
choose his successor. This could be as
soon as 1972, when the Pope reaches
the retirement age of 75 which he has
designated for others, if the strain
proves too much for his gallant spirit
but frail physique.


Watching the Oceans: A report from General Dynamics
Wouldn’t it be nice if you could plan a
vacation and know weeks ahead that
the weather would be good?
Actually, 24-hour local forecasting
is right almost 85 percent of the time.
But longer range prediction—on which
can depend anything from a vacation
-trip to the success of a year’s wheat
crop —is far less certain.
Even though information from
hundreds of full-time land weather
stations is supplemented by measure-
ments in the upper atmosphere and
reports from weather satellites, a vital
link in the chain has been missing.
Weather is essentially born or modi-
fied as a result of the interaction of
sun and air with the oceans that cover
two-thirds of the earth’s surface.
Oceanography and meteorology can
be considered two faces of the same
coin —the study of the total marine en-
vironment. And relatively little is
known about it yet.
Seagoing “weather bureau”:
What has been needed to fill the gap is
an oceanographic “weather bureau.”
It would have to stay in place in the
deepest part of the sea, regardless of
storm or current; collect environmen-
tal information from the atmosphere,
the surface and the depths; send that
information regularly and correctly
back to land.
And it would have to do all these
jobs without human presence for long
periods of time.
With a network of such sea stations
seeded throughout the world, oceanic
information could be integrated with
that obtained from land stations and
from space. Meteorologists could de-
termine the patterns that will create the
weather next week, or perhaps months
hence.
Oceanographers could analyze the
subsurface currents, the levels of dis-
solved nutrients in the water, the mi-
gratory patterns of fish to anticipate
their location for commercial fishing.
And with navigation lights, fog
horns and radar beacons at known po-
sitions, such a network would provide
invaluable navigation aid for ships.
Monster buoys:
Today, the beginning of such a world-
wide system may be at hand—an ocean
data station, more commonly known
as a monster buoy, developed and built
by General Dynamics for the United
States Navy’s Office of Naval Re-
search.
The first prototype has been under-
going sea trials since 1964, collecting
and sending its information through
calm and hurricane.
This ocean data system consists of
a giant pieplate-shaped buoy, forty
feet in diameter and seven and one-
half feet deep, containing an assort-
ment of environmental measuring de-
vices and the electronic and power
equipment to collect and transmit to
shore the data acquired.
It can be “locked” in place, moored
to an ocean floor as deep as 30,000
feet, by a plaited nylon cable only two
inches thick. Although the buoys are
presently designed to operate for a
year at a time without human mainte-
nance, the conventional propane-pow-
ered generator systems that provide
Someday a large network of ocean data stations
could simultaneously supply information about
weather and oceanographic factors throughout all
the oceans Land-based scientists could receive an
almost minute-by-minute picture of what is going
on throughout the total marine environment.
electricity for the buoy’s operation
carry a two-year supply of fuel.
Unlike a traditional ship, which ex-
aggerates the motion of waves, partic-
ularly in side-to-side pendulum-like
rolling, the symmetrical, discus-shaped
buoy hull follows the slope of the
waves, reducing pitching and rolling
to a minimum. Its stability keeps its
omnidirectional antenna in proper po-
sition to radio information to a shore
analysis station.
Defies hurricanes:
No one really knows just how rough
the weather might get in a full-scale
typhoon or hurricane—defined only as
a cyclonic storm with winds of over
75 miles per hour—because of the ob-
vious difficulty of humans taking ac-
curate measurements under such con-
ditions.
The General Dynamics/ONR ocean
data station was designed to withstand
winds of 160 miles per hour and waves
60 feet high.
Buoy Bravo, the first prototype, re-
mained in place under winds of 110
miles per hour and waves 50 feet high
during Hurricane Betsy in 1965, with
no interruption in its flow of informa-
tion. Its elastic nylon mooring line
permits the buoy to drift slightly and
then pull back to position without
dragging its “anchor” of steel chain.
Typhoons and hurricanes, luckily
occur only occasionally. But the in-
tensely corrosive environment of the
sea is constant. For protection, the
buoy’s steel hull, mast and antennae
are coated with inorganic zinc and sev-
eral layers of vinyl.
A hundred tests:
An assortment of sensors can be lo-
cated on the 38-foot-high mast and on
the radial spokes of the discone an-
tenna to measure wind, humidity, pre-
cipitation, radiation (from the sky and
reflected back from the sea), baromet-
ric pressure, and compass bearing.
Others inside and immediately un-
der the hull will read water tempera-
ture at the surface, wave height, period
and direction.
Clamped along the mooring line at
regular intervals underwater, still oth-
ers will measure temperature, pressure
and salinity and determine the struc-
ture of subsurface layers of the depths.
Inside the hull, rugged electronic
components and circuitry will acquire,
store and transmit information from
as many as 100 separate sensors.
These subsystems will be packaged

The ground station will also instruct
the buoy to transmit data on the par-
ticular one of its three radio channels
which will assure best reception on
shore of long-distance “bounce” off
the ionosphere.
Benefit for all nations:
A few prototype monster buoys do
not, to be sure, constitute a full-scale
oceanic environmental survey. They
do provide a starting point for a truly
international system —one in which all
nations would share, and from which
all would benefit.
But now that the practicality of an
ocean data station has been proved,
the many elements of a total system are
already being worked out: the opti-
mum number and locations of stations
to provide simultaneous coverage
throughout the seas; ways to integrate
at central analysis stations the ocean
data with that from land and space;
techniques of maintenance and replen-
ishment for the seaborne network; de-
velopment of devices to measure many
kinds of subsurface phenomena.
The day when data stations will be
dotted throughout the oceans for a
genuine oceanographic-meteorologi-
cal environmental watch could come
within a decade.

Taking the plunge into publishing
Sam Ure Smith ... old hand
Alex Sheppard ... newcomer
By SANDRA HALL
AFTER 18 YEARS as a bookseller,
Colonel Alex Sheppard of Sydney has
turned to publishing. About two months
ago he brought out Bethia Foote’s
account of the career of Jack Lang,
“Dismissal of a Premier,” after it
reputedly had been turned down by
some other publishers; it is now selling
extremely well.
Colonel Sheppard has hired a
manager for Morgan’s, his bookshop,
and is publishing two books a month,
beginning with two novels, one a con-
temporary story about Sydney by Keith
Thomas, the other, set in Canada, by
Gwen Kelly. He plans to print 10 per-
cent of the editions in hardback and 90
percent in paperback. They’ll be called
Alpha Books and will be designed by
Transfield prizewinner Harry William-
son.
“I’ve set up five bookshops in this
country,” Colonel Sheppard says, “all
of them still running, and I felt it was
time I went into publishing. I’ve been
thinking about it for a while, but if
Bethia Foote’s book had flopped I
couldn’t have gone on. You need a
minimum of $lO,OOO to start as an in-
dependent publisher and a lot of
credit with the printers. You couldn’t
do it without that.”
This seems as good an illustration as
any of what makes a publisher, the
chance that starts him off, the
enthusiasms which keep him going.
Of the existing Australian companies,
Rigby’s and Angus and Robertson
are the only ones to have survived the
vicissitudes of publishing during the
19 th century.
W. C. Rigby, whose first publication
was a sermon by a Cornish parson,
delivered in the South Australian
copper mining town of Moonta, was
an Adelaide bookseller. Until 1936, the
firm’s publishing activities were
sporadic and confined mostly to
educational books, but Rigby’s did
publish the book which started Pixie
O’Harris on her career as a children’s
artist.
George Robertson, a founder of
Angus and Robertson, seems to have
been responsible for the first public
statement on publishing. It was a cau-
tious remark, well suited to the uncer-
tainties of the time. No publisher, he
said, should issue anything for which
he was not prepared to take the risk;
there was considerable harm done by the
issuing of books merely because their
authors had been able to pay the cost
of the printing; the shelves of the book-
sellers had been loaded with unwanted
books.
By the late 1860 s, Robertson felt
confident enough to “take the risk” on
his first book a book of verse by
H. Peden Steel titled “A Crown of
Wattle.” “The Man from Snowy
River” reinforced his confidence in the
1890 s by selling 25,000 copies in 19
months.
“Banjo” Paterson’s poems are still
steady sellers on the Angus and Robert-
son list, along with Henry Lawson’s
work and C. J. Dennis’ “The Senti-
mental Bloke.” Books which also main-
tain seemingly permanent positions
there are Norman Lindsay’s “The
Magic Pudding,” 50 years old this
year, May Gibbs’ timeless sagas of
life in gumnut land, H. M. Green’s
“A History of Australian Literature,”
Manning Clark’s “Select, Documents,”
Neville Cayley’s “What Bird Is That?”
and “The Commonsense Cookery
Book,” which has sold over a million
copies.
George Ferguson, a grandson of
George Robertson, who now heads
Angus and Robertson, began working
for the company in 1931 in the book
shop and remembers that it was almost
impossible to sell an Australian book
before the War. “Migrants, the use
of Australian school readers, and the
growth of the library movement have
helped to change things,” he said. “The
first book I had a hand in? It’s hard
to pinpoint, but it was probably a book
called ‘Sun and Cloud on River and
Sea’ by Ishmael Dare, or Arthur Jose,
which was his real name.”
Angus and Robertson publishes an
average qf 150 new books a year, about
45 percent of them educational, 20
percent children’s books, and six per-
cent new novels, although the propor-
tion varies from year to year. The com-
pany is opening an office in Singa-
pore this month as part of a plan to
sell more books in Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines, and, later, in Indonesia.
Two books touching on the Pacific
area, “The Philippines” by John Cock-
roft and “Australia’s Foreign Policy”
by Dr. T. B. Millar, are on the com-
pany’s current list.
Several Australian publishers are
interested in books about the Pacific
now, but Andrew Fabinyi, of Cheshire’s,
published Wilfred Burchett’s “Pacific
Treasure Island: New Caledonia”
soon after he joined Cheshire’s in 1939
and followed it up with “Two Pacific
Democracies: China and Australia” by
Y. Tsao, then Chinese vice-consul in
Melbourne.
Fabinyi says of the second book:
“I would like to live long enough to
publish another book under the same
title. In any case, both books repre-
sented my view that the immense scope
of English-language publishing gives
us a responsibility to deal with the
world around us that is, the Pacific
and Asia which was then regarded
as a dead subject elsewhere.”
He adds that the Burchett book was
an immediate best seller and had four
editions, but would have sold more
had it not been for the wartime restric-
tions on paper.
Although Frank Cheshire founded
Cheshire’s in 1925, in Melbourne, the
firm’s publishing activities were at
first incidental to educational book-
selling. Before 1939, it had published
only three books one on kinder-
garten methods, a paperback edition of
“A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and
“First Two Years’ Arithmetic and
Algebra,” which is still in print and
has sold over a million copies.
In the early days, Fabinyi was his
own editor, production manager, sales
and advertising manager, as well as
doing other jobs in the bookshop. To-
day, he heads a staff of 50. But other-
wise, he feels Cheshire’s hasn’t changed
since it pioneered new techniques in
schoolbook publishing and issued the


first work done at the Australian
National University.
The company’s best sellers have been
Alan Marshall’s “I Can Jump Puddles,”
“The Australian Ugliness” by Robin
Boyd, Henry Mayer’s “Australian
Politics,” and “Australian Civilisation”
edited by Peter Coleman, together with
a number of secondary-school books.
Tempering Fabinyi’s confidence
about the future development of
Australian publishing are some fears—
“the danger of overproduction, the
overexploitation of certain themes,
and an overestimate of the potential-
ities of the market, particularly because
of the difficult economic position of
Australian bookselling.
“But there will be expansion and I
believe it will reflect fresh thinking on
new educational techniques. I see a
particularly bright future for new
Australian work at both scholarly and
popular level in the fields of sociology
and economics.
“I’m confident, too, that new creative
talent which we need will come
forward to force the public back to
fiction. The publication of Australian
poetry, now often a labor of love, could
well turn into something commercially
viable within the next few years.
“The future will also largely depend
on our ability to export more Austra-
lian books and Australian copyrights
and generally to keep our publishing
right in the mainstream of international
publishing.”
One section of the market set for
immediate expansion is paperback
publishing. Since its quality has im-
proved immeasurably over the years, it
has become responsible for an increas-
ing amount of • fiction sales. As one
publisher put it, “Young people seem
to resent hard binding.”
Meanwhile, Sun Books, now almost
three years old, is beginning to publish
books simultaneously in hardback and
paperback. “We used to go straight into
paperback with new books,” Geoffrey
Dutton, one of the partners in Sun
Books, explained, “but we’re not doing
that any more, because we feel authors
should have a hardback release as well
for libraries, prestige, and so on.”
When Dutton and his partner, Brian
Stonier, formed Sun Books they pub-
lished several books at the same time
in order to get enough impact Maie
Casey’s “An Australian Story,” “Alien
Son” by Judah Waten, “The Permit”
by Donald Horne, Gary Player’s “Golf
Secrets,” and “Maurice Guest” by
Henry Handel Richardson.
“We had a catholic attitude, which
I think we’ve maintained,” Dutton
says. “This year, we’re doing the anti-
hanging book edited by Barry Jones,
one on modern Australian art, reprints
of some best sellers, translations of
Russian poetry, an annual collection of
Australian cartoons, and a sort of egg-
heads’ book about freshwater fish, as
well as some scientific and educational
books.”
One of Australian publishing’s best
success stories belongs to Ure Smith,
who published “They’re a Weird Mob”
after it had arrived as an unsolicited
manuscript which had been rejected by
another publisher.
“I thought it should sell 10,000 to
20,000 copies,” Sam Ure Smith says,
“but I didn’t know it would do as well
as it did.” It was published in Novem-
ber, 1957, the first printing of 6000
copies was completely sold the same
month, a second printing of 8000 was
sold in January, 30,000 in February,
then 10,000 every ten days. In six
months, it had sold over 80,000 in
hardback, and in three years 100,000
in paperback and 300,000 in hardback.
It was so big, it nearly undid us.”
Ure Smith’s biggest sellers have
been in humorous books—Alistair Mor-
rison’s book about “Strine,” which sold
over 100,000, and Cyril Pearl’s “So
You Want to be an Australian,” 30,000
to 40,000.
The development of Ure Smith pub-
lishing has been in several stages, begin-
ning in 1916 with Sidney Ure Smith’s
publication of the J. J. Hilder Mem-
orial Catalogue. At the time, Ure Smith
was studying art at the Julian Ashton
school, the odd man out in a family of
hoteliers and pastoralists. He was a
recognised etcher, but art was no more
than a hobby alongside his real interest,
publishing.
The catalogue led to the first edition
of “Art in Australia,” and a company,
taking the name of the quarterly, was
formed. The books published at that
time were more elaborate editions of
the magazine.
In 1935, the company combined
with “The Sydney Morning Herald”
to interest itself in the publication of
a magazine called “The Home”; in
1939, Sidney Ure Smith left the SMH
to form Ure Smith Pty. Ltd. The
company published magazines and a
series of art books, but found it hard
to exist dealing exclusively with the
arts.
“Before my father’s death in 1949
we didn’t do a great deal toward
becoming a general publishing house,”
Mr. Ure Smith said, “but in 1950
we started thinking about it in earnest.
I found out I didn’t know a great deal
about it, so I worked in England for
two years. When I got back, ‘Weird
Mob’ blasted us into the general field.
We had to stay there.
“We outgrew our capital structure,
so considered a merger with another
publishing company. We chose Horwitz
group for the partnership, because we
felt Ure Smith would add well to
Horwitz’s diversity. As I see Australian
publishing, we’ve become a lot less
parochial we have a hard look at
everything for the American and
British market, and now for the Asian
55
one.
While Ure Smith began life publish-
ing with art books and magazines,
Lansdowne Press has just decided to
launch itself into the art field with
the Australian Art Library, billed as'
“the largest single project to be under-
taken by an Australian publisher.” Art
critic and teacher John Henshaw is
editing the series, of which 30 titles
are to be published initially in various
formats and price ranges early in 1969.
Yet Lloyd O’Neil, who founded Lans-
downe in Melbourne in 1960, did so
with a book titled “How to Play Aussie
Rules,” which featured tips on the game
from 20 football stars. “It was
immediately available. I’d had it in
mind when I was manager of Jacaranda
Press in Brisbane and I resigned from
Jacaranda to do it.”
O’Neil’s start in the book business
was as a bookseller in Angus and
Robertson’s in 1945. He spent four
years at Cassell’s Australian office,
then became Jacaranda Press’ first
employee. “The first book I had a hand
in publishing was called ‘ALP—The
Story of the Labor Party.’ I had 10
percent of the Jacaranda shares, but
as Brian Clouston, the managing
director, is only four years older than
I am, I knew I’d be number two to
him for the rest of my days if I
stayed. He’s a close friend, and I
thought I’d go as far away as possible
to start on my own, so I started Lans-
downe in Melbourne.”
Lansdowne’s emphasis has been on
Australian history, biography, sport, and
current affairs, with children’s books
and some humor.
“We haven’t done many novels, but
we are doing one this year—‘The Wine
of God’s Anger’ by Kenneth Cook. It’s
about a Catholic conscript sent to a
war like the Vietnam one—and I think
it’s a powerful book in the present con-
text. As for the art series, art has always
interested me. I was in charge of the
art department at A and R. I suppose
we’ve been planning this for 18 months
or so.”
Brian Clouston made his publishing
debut with a secondary-school anthology
called “Living Verse,” which has been
re-printed 17 times since 1954 and has
sold almost 500,000 copies. Jacaranda
has had success with its Minenda
Readers, used throughout the Pacific
for the teaching of English as a second
language, and its steadiest sales with
the Jacaranda Pocket Guide series deal-
ing with aspects of Australian natural
history.
The company’s most surprising sales
success was “We Are Going,” a
collection of verse by the Aboriginal
poet Kath Walker, which sold seven
editions in ten weeks. Jacaranda also
claims Australian publishing’s most
spectacular failure—Tony Morphett’s
novel, “Fitzgerald,” which was pulped
on the eve of publication because of
a threatened libel action.
“Australian book buyers’ tastes have
changed for two reasons,” Clouston
says. “The first is a world-wide one and
is concerned with the impact of tele-
vision. The market for fiction of the
light, ephemeral type has almost dis-
appeared. The second reason is the
emergence of a growing national con-
sciousness in Australia over the past 20
years. There’s evidence of this in every
publisher’s list.”


The man for the jobs
ABORIGINES, education, and the arts:
a dedication to one of this trinity of
good causes would be enough to salve
the social consciences of most men.
But not for Dr. Herbert Cole Coombs.
Having established a reputation as
by far the best central banker Aus-
tralia has had, despite the mistakes,
particularly in his earlier inflexible
approach to interest rates, that he now
freely admits to, Dr. Coombs is
now setting out, at 62, to make a new
career out of what have been side-
interests.
If his approach to his new jobs
chairman of the Council for Aboriginal
Affairs, chairman of the Australian
Council for the Arts and, a seeming
contradiction in terms, the first full-
time Chancellor of the Australian
National University follows the
pattern of his 184 years in charge of
Dr. Coombs pauses to reflect
the central bank, then there will
be remarkable energy and an in-
triguing ability to innovate applied to
them. There may also be some stub-
bornness on matters on which he has
made up his mind.
The thread which runs through Dr.
Coombs’ attitude to his three new jobs
is his belief in the benefits that can
come from training people for their
roles in life.
His views on education are heavily
involved with the proper use of our
“large proportion of highly educated
and scientifically trained people” and
of the “quite impressive” research
institute structure in Australia. His view
is that these resources are under-
employed; that there should be closer
association between these areas and
industry. It seems likely that his in-
fluence in higher education may well
be to increase the interaction be-
tween the universities and the business
community.
He also sees a need for an improve-
ment in the quality of business leaders.
Some years ago, Dr. Coombs made a
powerful complaint about the calibre
of management in Australia. Recently
he said there were signs of improve-
ment. “But there is an awfully long
way to go yet,” he added. He
thought that the quality of manage-
ment was perhaps improving at a
faster rate than that of directors; the
very limited supply of people suitable
for directorship duties made for a
situation in which there are too many
demands on them, sometimes to a
degree where all the work involved
cannot be coped with adequately.
How does Dr. Coombs intend to try
to solve this problem? At his retirement
Press conference he seemed to be sug-
gesting the creation of an educated elite,
a group of people who would have the
right economic and financial back-
ground and who would get the right
training while still young enough to be
inventive and creative. He suggested an
institutional method of doing this;
possibly the banks could act as the
channel for these directorship services,
recruiting and training a stock of skilled
professional directors who would be
available at a fee to industry.
It is only a short step from this view
to the French elitist educational system,
where the bulk of top management and
public servants come through an educa-
tional process that prepares them for
their leading roles. As Chancellor of the
ANU, Dr. Coombs will certainly be in
a position to influence the tertiary
education system along these lines,
although his university is the most
removed of all from the business atmos-
phere. But the prospect of the ANU
being a source of supply of an elite,
specially trained for positions of power
in the public service and industry, is a
real one under the Coombs banner.
His style is already clear. As the
creator of the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust, which he has now left for his
new Australian Council job, he tended
to dominate. The Elizabethan in 1954
was greeted with public enthusiasm. It
was only in recent years that it dis-
solved in seas of criticism, so that Dr.
Coombs, leaving for the new body, •
appears as if he were deserting a sink-
ing ship and striking out alone for the
shore.
However, the Elizabethan, in what is
relatively a short space of time, estab-
lished the necessity and usefulness of
public support for the arts and, almost
by its mistakes and misdirections,
formed a basis on which the new Aus-
tralian Council can build. There were
practical difficulties, too. Dr. Coombs,
as a public servant, felt he was not able
publicly to answer criticism, and his
associates did not often do this effec-
tively. Also, he would be entirely aware
that not always can the man be found
for the job.
Also, with Dr. Coombs’ background,
it is hard not to believe that some, or
perhaps even a majority, of the people
chosen for the Elizabethan board may
have caused him recurring surprise and
disappointment. It is hard, unless you
have had constant proximity to the
“patrons of the arts” in Australia, to
realise the extent of their limitations.
Dr. Coombs’ role as a supporter of
Australian art is perhaps more in-
teresting, and certainly he has been
more successful here than with the
more intractable performing arts. The
Reserve Bank has probably been the
largest single customer of Australian
paintings, which adorn what have been
called the “stately pleasure domes,”
the offices of the Reserve Bank
throughout the Commonwealth.
In its patronage of art the Reserve
Bank has very much gone its own
way. In Canberra, where life is so
ordered that permission must be
obtained for any outside sculpture, the
Reserve Bank is something of a
law unto itself. However, Sydney art
dealer Mr. Rudy Komon has sug-
gested that the bank’s taste in paintings
has been Dr. Coombs’ and that it is
very good taste; Mr. Komon, who
might still know more art than high
finance, has suggested that the
bank’s collection of paintings has
appreciated in value more rapidly than
any other of its assets.
This Coombs view on training people
for special tasks can play a major role
in his work with Aborigines. So far,
Dr. Coombs has had little to say about
what he plans to do as chairman of
the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, but
he did say a short time ago that the
council would be looking for ways
of giving Aborigines effective training
so they can successfully find work, as
well as giving them help to embark on
individual enterprises.
Aborigines should not be sheltered
from the need to manage their own
affairs, is his basic policy; only by
having to make decisions can they
learn to make them.
Here, too, Dr. Coombs appears in-
tent on creating a skilled elite of
decision-makers. But whether this
policy can be extended effectively into
his third area of interest, the arts, is
another matter. It may take more than
Dr. Coombs’ energy and determin-
ation to develop a skilled group
capable of running the various arts
with the mixture of ability, training,
and enthusiasm that Dr. Coombs seems
to set as his ideal.
For this reason alone, his arts job
may be the most difficult of the three
for him.

Now, the foodexplosion
By PETER SAMUEL
AMONG THE MEMBERS of the in-
tellectual establishment in Western
countries, a principal conventional
wisdom is that a calamitous food short-
age is about to overcome the world.
Mouths are multiplying more quickly
than the food to feed them, so the
modern Malthusian theory describes
the course of events. These views are
propagated by a variety of people. The
most prestigious is the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organisation,
which regularly issues pessimistic
statements about world food prospects.
Often the people who take the greatest
interest in the underdeveloped world
take the same line.
Articles and books on the subject
proliferate. One of the most recent,
titled “Famine — 1975!”, argues the
case that “the stork has passed the
plough” even more vigorously than
anything to date. It is worth quoting
several passages to appreciate the tone
of the argument: “The locomotive
roaring straight at us is the population
explosion. The unmovable landslide
across the tracks is the stagnant pro-
duction of food in the undeveloped
nations, the nations where population
is greatest. The collision is inevitable.
The famines are inevitable.”
This example, with its generalisation
of the message of impending doom
and its fatalism is perhaps extreme,
but it communicates the essence of
arguments being put around by a
variety of goodwilled people wanting
to do the right thing by the potential
victims of this disaster.
How an assertion of the inevitability
of disaster can possibly appeal as part
of an argument for trying to avert it,
beats me, but the more important
point is that the facts are grotesquely
wrong. Food production in the under-
developed world has not been stag-
nant unless all the statistics which have
been collected in the past 20 years
are completely misleading. In a tiny
handful of countries Uruguay, Cuba,
Burma, and Algeria there has been
no evidence of a rising trend, but
among all the other 50 or 60 countries
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
there is such evidence. Food production
has generally been rising in a small
majority of countries at a faster rate
than population, in a minority at a
slower rate than population.
Asia is the area of Australia’s greatest
interest and here the picture is pretty
clear. It certainly is not working
according to the simple formulae of
disaster. Every country has a different
food-population picture, and general-
isations simply do not make sense
except perhaps the generalisation that
there are no insuperable physical or
economic problems in the way of an
improvement. China, Vietnam, Burma,
and Indonesia have been the poor
performers. In China the food situation
has varied inversely with the peaks and
troughs of Maoist fervor. In 1959 and
1960, following the utopian nonsense
of the Great Leap Forward, food pro-
duction plummetted. In the period of
relaxation and relative pragmatism it
revived and benefited by the expansion
of irrigation and fertiliser supply. Now,
under the Cultural Revolution, when to
put production ahead of ideological
purity is a heinous crime again and
when anarchy is prevalent, production
is falling again. In Vietnam, stricken by
war, perhaps a third of the fields of
the country have been abandoned by
farmers and a normally food-surplus
country is turned into a major im-
porter. Burma, shut off from the rest
of the world, wracked by tribal insur-
gencies, and hampered by very corrupt
nationalised trading companies, is
really an unknown. But it is a fair
guess that its food production is not
keeping pace with population growth.
Despite its long period under Sukarno,
Indonesia has done surprisingly well in
food production. Today, its food prob-
lem is related mainly to the rundown
of the transport system and persecution
of the Chinese trading community.
Given peace and governments inter-
ested in feeding their people, there
appears to be no reason why they
should not succeed. There is certainly
nothing inevitable about failure.
This is demonstrated in the successes
of the rest of Asia. Japan, Malaysia,
Singapore, and Hong Kong of course
have no food problems. They are all
able to buy enough food with the
export income they earn by the
strength of their economies, like the
countries of Western Europe. South
Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, are
well-reported success stories with food
problems solved, agricultural develop-
ment having achieved “take-off” sev-
eral years ago, and industrialisation
posing the major economic challenge.
The Philippines, Ceylon, India, and
Pakistan form a sort of middle group
of countries whose mediocre perform-
ance to date —despite massive economic
aid and governments at least verbally
committed to development have
represented the great question-mark.
The Philippines, with its brazenly com-
mercial political system, its gross land-
lordism, and apparently casual Latin
attitudes to administration, has seemed
something of a no-hoper. But, defying
expectations, this year it is self-
sufficient in its staple food of rice for
the first time in its history.
Ceylon, governed by a coterie of
parties which look from outside about
as improbable an administration as a
coalition of the Australian Labor Party,
the Communist Party, and the collec-
tion of protesters around Mr. R. Gould,
is also doing very well in food produc-
tion. Its rice harvest in 1967-8 was up
by 12 percent over the previous record.
Indeed it is the food performance of
the Indian sub-continent, following
devastating droughts and despite rather
inept administrations, which gives the
greatest grounds for hope.
An American agricultural expert,
Lester Brown, writing in the latest issue
of “Foreign Affairs,” argues that the
picture in Asia is so bright that it
justifies the term “agricultural revolu-
tion” as a description of the radical
improvements which are occuring. The
Indian food-grain harvest this year is
expected to reach 100 million tons,
a magic figure for years, one which
many people in India and outside
doubted was ever attainable. When the
British left, production was about 40
million tons and with Nehru’s fascina-
tion with Stalinist models of forced-
draught growth based on steel produc-
tion and heavy engineering, the agri-
cultural growth performance was poor
and by the middle of this decade some-
thing of a crisis was developing. The
picture was not much different in
Pakistan. There is virtual unanimity
among experts that the Indian sub-
continent has now turned the corner
in modernising food production. India’s
100-million-ton harvest is not only an
increase of a third on the drought-year
harvest but a 12 percent rise on the
last good-season record. Pakistan’s
harvest, gathered in April and May, is
up 30 percent on last year.
Brown sees the progress as attribut-
able to “solid technological progress—
more efficient varieties, more fertiliser,

better farm practices.” In the case of
India, years of cadre work by com-
munity-development officers of the
central Government would appear to
be paying off in increased receptiveness
on the part of peasants to new ideas.
Brown points out that for the govern-
ments of the region “shortchanging
agriculture is no longer either feasible
or fashionable.” For about four years
now agriculture has been getting
higher priority than industry in govern-
ment budgets and aid programs. The
short-tether policy of U.S. aid where-
by food-aid agreements are short-term
affairs with renewal dependant on local
effort and performance, has been im-
portant. When the record of govern-
ment-to-government communications is
finally published, it may well show
that the Americans have literally black-
mailed a number of governments into
effective food policies. In any case, these
have been adopted on the results.
Budgets for agriculture have been en-
larged. Restrictions on foreign invest-
ment have been waived, to allow in-
creased fertiliser production by private
firms.
But the key e’ement in the so-called
“agricultural revolution” is the rapid
introduction of new varieties of cereal
seeds. In wheat the revolution is with
the so-called Mexican dwarf varieties.
The Mexican Government, working
with the Rockefeller Foundation from
the late 19405, succeeded in raising
yields by 250 percent through a seed-
breeding program. The great character-
istic of the wheats they have developed
is that, unlike most tropical varieties,
they respond to fertiliser without
growing long and lanky and falling
over. In 1965 Pakistan and India started
to import Mexican seed and this year
it is being used on almost all the irri-
gated wheatland in the Indian sub-
continent.
In rice, the Philippines is the country
famous for the new high-yielding
varieties. The best known is IR-8, a
cross between an Indonesian and a
Taiwanese rice, developed by the Inter-
national Rice Research Institute, sup-
ported by the Ford Foundation. Yield
A U.N. helping

pines (centre) paddy
fields now yield
double, even treble,
crops. A Vietnam-
ese farmer (left)
with a precious load
increases of between 100 and 400 per-
cent are being achieved by the introduc-
tion of IR-8. Such results require, of
course, irrigation and fertiliser, but
these are now being made available
and used on an expanded scale. A
number of qualities are being success-
fully bred into the new strains a
ripening period of 120 days compared
to 180 normally, an insensitivity to day-
light length which allows it to be
planted at any time of the year. Double
and even treble cropping is therefore
often made possible.
Advances are also being made in
the breeding of high-yielding sorghums
and millets. And hybrid corns, for a
long time an American specialty, are
being spread through a. number of
Asian countries.
Early attempts to popularise better
seeds failed because of peasant scepti-
cism. The improved yields were margi-
nal and unconvincing to the cynical
farmer. And often they required a whole
variety of new practices to be intro-
duced with the new seed for it to be
successful. Now the improved seeds
are so spectacularly good that the
barriers of suspicion fall quickly.
The new seeds have provided farm-
ers with the incentive in larger harvests
and the cash flow of profits to invest
heavily in equipment. In the Pakistani
part of the Punjab, for instance, over
30,000 tubewells and pumps (costing
$lOOO to $2500 each) have been in-
stalled in five years, most without
subsidy or government assistance.
Mexican wheats make them tremend-
ously profitable, and they are paid off
in two years generally. Pesticides, dust-
ers, grain-drying equipment and the
like are being bought in unprecedented
numbers.
As significant as anything is the fact
that the more intensive agriculture
being developed as a result of better
seed requires more labor. Two or three
crops are often grown in 12 months
where one was before. Planting and
harvesting work is multiplied. Extra
weeding is needed. This utilises Asia’s
greatest untapped resource people
who work half-pace, half the day. They
have something profitable to employ
them for the first time.
Brown argues that this agricultural
revolution is likely to have a social
impact as well as an economic one.
With subsistence farmers turning to
marketing and changing their annual
work pattern from that handed down
to them by their fathers, they are likely
to become less traditional and more
pragmatic in other aspects of their
life. They may, in particular, become
more receptive to birth control.
India’s 100-million-ton harvest should
shake the gloom-mongers out of their
neo-Malthusian nightmares.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Standing united or
dividing for a fall?
Wool nets
54 bale lots
boost efficiency
THE FIRST OVERALL reduction in
freight rates for exports to Britain
and Europe since 1930 is, by agree-
ment of most exporters, not anywhere
good enough. Under the new proposals,
yet to be ratified, shipping rates for
wool and general cargo are to be
reduced by 4| percent, and those for
refrigerated cargoes, such as meat and
dairy products, by two percent. Sav-
ings will range from $3 a ton on most
manufactures to 6 cents a 60-pound
carton of beef. But, for one reason
and another, exporters, particularly
wool exporters, have been thinking in
the region of a ten percent cut and they
aren’t going to accept the current offer
without putting up a fight.
Superficially, the offer of the Aus-
tralian-Europe shipping Conference of
23 British and European shipping lines
appears fair almost to the point of
generosity. Its basis was the accoun-
tants’ reports of voyage results for all
the ships within the Conference for
1967, the first full year of a “ration-
alised” shipping service.
The Conference lines are becoming
better organised and more efficient:
better handling methods and packing
of products, and relative peace on the
Australian waterfront, had helped to
keep costs down; there was a reduction
in voyage times of 3.2 days south-
wards and 6.2 days northwards; there
was a 20 percent improvement in load-
ing and discharging times in Europe;
and in Australia loading was improved
by 12.9 percent and discharging by
5.7 percent.
Despite an increase in costs through
normal inflation of 3.5 percent, the
accountants’ reports showed an over-
all surplus of 4.3 percent above the
eight percent profit on capital em-
ployed, which, by agreement, goes,
to the shipowners. Such a surplus is
normally shared between the exporters
and the shipowners. But not this year.
The latest negotiations took into
consideration the closure of the Suez
Canal, which added a six percent sur-
charge to shipping costs, and were
carried on in the face of open demands
from the wool shippers for reductions
in freight rates of at least ten per-
cent, demands for greater freedom
of action by members of the British
wool federation, and tentative negotia-
tions in the direction of Bulgarian,
Polish, and Russian shipping as an
alternative to the Conference lines,
particularly as far as shipments of
wool to Eastern Europe were con-
cerned. Whatever the reasons which
prompted the move, the Conference
decided to pass the full surplus of
4.3 percent on to the shippers.
Broadly speaking, the offer seems fair
enough. And yet the shippers have had
a perennial attitude of suspicion and
distrust for the Conference lines for
more than 80 years; and this the Con-
ference has encouraged with the secret-
iveness of its activities in the decision-
making field and its regular ploys to
oust outside competition despite the
perpetual cries from the shippers for
unregulated competition. Competition,
goes the argument, would do away
with the overtonnage which is inherent
in the Conference system and which is
only too obviously offset by higher
freight rates.
The next move now rests with the
wool shippers, who account for some
40 percent of the total cargoes shipped
by the Conference lines to Britain and
Europe. They are singuarly unim-
pressed with the \\ percent cut in
freight rates, which will save them about
$1.6 million on the average 2.3 million
bales shipped to Britain and Europe, or
about 0.23 cents a pound of greasy
wool or twice that amount on clean
wool, and of no consequence at all as
far as wool, prices are concerned.
As the major exporters, the wool
shippers’ attitude toward the new
freight rates is critical to the whole
Conference arrangement. Unless the
wool shippers accept their \\ percent
cut it is unlikely that the others will.
One main argument for not accept-
ing is that wool has been subsidising
other commodity freight rates for far
too long and this can no longer be
sustained. Another is that the impor-
tant changes taking place in the
handling and packaging of wool a
commodity which particularly lends
itself to such innovations has added
considerably to the Conference lines
increased efficiency and will continue to
do so increasingly for some time yet.
Here, they have a good case for fur-
ther freight-rate reductions. Already
the shipping of bales in larger pre-
strapped units or nets has cut the time
of loading and unloading by as much
as seven times and has been voted such
a success by buyers that they are pre-
pared to change their buying habits to
accommodate it. Further advances in
container handling are obviously not
far ahead, and, on this basis, the mem-
bers of Interlaine, which accounts for
some tvyo-thirds of the annual wool
shipments, are determined to negotiate
their own lower freight rates in Europe
and will meet there with Conference
representatives in August. Obviously
wool shippers in Australia could find
themselves at a disadvantage were they
to accept the new rates without quali-
fication now.
It seems likely that Australian wool
shippers will try to reopen the question
of freight rates with the Conference
as early as possible. Such a move will
involve the co-operation and participa-
tion of all wool shippers, including the
Interlaine group, the British wool
federation, and the East European
shippers.
With Interlaine all set for its own
negotiations and the East Europeans
gesturing toward their own local ship-
ping lines, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment’s paternal advice to the wool
shippers divided, they will fall
points out the weakness of the current
situation. The various factions of the
wool shippers are each concerned that
the others will not negotiate secretly
advantageous shipping arrangements.
Yet this is exactly what they seem to
be on the verge of doing. Unless they
unite, the Conference will hold the
whip hand, and the proposed new
freight rates will no doubt have to be
accepted.
COMMONWEALTH STATISTICS
FOOD FOR THOUGHT
VOCIFEROUS followers of the cur-
rent vogue for “preaching caution in an
atmosphere, of euphoria” were given
their first solid food for quiet contem-
plation last week in the preliminary
statistics on the current account and
capital inflow from the office of the
Commonwealth Statistician.
The trends had all been predicted
well in advance, only the details were


new. But for the pessimists there were
healthy cash results from the minerals
boom to be considered and a promising
jump of $lO2 million in Government
loan raising. And for the euphoric
optimists who still remain there is the
chastening game of trying to unravel
the extent of volatile elements con-
tained in the $629 million leap in
total capital inflow.
Despite the bad effects of the
drought on rural production, total
exports held more or less steady at
$2944 million. Mineral exports made
a good start toward their hoped-for
earnings of $lOOO million by 1975,
with iron ore more than doubling to
$lOO million, alumina sales showing a
rise of $3B million, and coal a rise
of $l5 million. Admittedly, some 88
percent of all iron ore and 96 percent
of coal went to Japan and there is
every reason for advocating and seek-
ing a more widely diversified market.
But such considerations should not be
allowed to distort the immediate pros-
pect: the drought has broken; mineral
exports can be expected to show even
bigger growth next year; and in a
couple of years’ time indigenous oil
should be wiping an annual $3OO mil-
lion off the import bill.
Imports last year, however, jumped
by $344 million, and of the total $3182
million, some $B4O million was spent
in the U.S., where defence and civil
aircraft purchases will continue to
absorb a large proportion. Add to the
trade deficit of $238 million transport
costs (up by $55 million to $290 mil-
lion) and the cost of servicing over-
seas investment (up by $53 million to
$446 million) and the deficit of the
current account yawns some $431
million wider at $lOBl million.
The capital inflow more than
covered that. Government loan raisings
were up by $lO2 million—though with
most of this being accounted for by
defence loans tied to the purchase of
military equipment. The Marketing
Authorities were up from a deficit of
$76 million' to an inflow of $34 million
though this reflects the drought-
diminished wheat crop, and so a fall
in the credit extended on wheat
exports, hardly a real capital inflow.
Then, with undistributed companies’
income up $l2 million to $ll5 mil-
ion, the Commonwealth Statistician’s
elucidation of capital inflow comes to
a halt, the potential volatility of some
$9OO million still undisclosed.
According to former precedent, the
mysterious “balancing item” in the
account is accepted without further
questioning, though this year at $493
million it accounts for something more
than a third of the total capital inflow,
beating the previous record of 1965-66,
when about a third of the total or $263
million was so classified. There is no
evidence that previous items have been
particularly volatile, but, equally, there
is no way of predicting the character
of a completely unknown element.
The classification of a further $.400
million is, in effect, only a little less
vague. By lumping together portfolio
MEN AND MATTERS
THERE ARE already something like
45 life-assurance companies registered
in Australia. And now Mr. George
D. Bjurman, executive vice-president of
Occidental Life Insurance Co. of Cali-
fornia (the ninth-biggest in the United
States), is out here to start up the 46th.
Do we need another? According to
cautious, quietly spoken 62-year-old Mr.
Bjurman, we do, because his company is
bringing in “something extra” in the
form of fixed-term assurance that can
bring insurance cover of $20,000 for
about $B6 a year against a more con-
ventional form of policy that would cost
up to $3Bl.
But if Occidental can do it, so can the
other 45. So the real significance of
Occidental seems more related to what
its investment policy is going to be like
in Australia. Already the company has
brought about $2 million into the
country to form the basis of its local
fund (under Australian insurance law,
all local premiums must be invested
locally). The money, by the way, came
from Occidental’s Canadian operations,
where it has $77 million worth of assets,
rather than from the U.S., where its
assets total $1.3 billion, because of the
Administration’s guidelines policy.
But it is this very guidelines policy
that seems to have presented Occidental
with a great deal of the investment
opportunities that it seems to be look-
ing for in Australia. For Mr. Bjurman,
who has a daily investment turnover of
about $5 million back in Los Angeles,
seems strongly attracted to the fixed-
interest offerings of the U.S. subsidiaries
operating here which have been raising
money locally because they are unable
to raise it at home. The current Esso
issue, at an interest rate \ percent better
than Esso is offering back in the U.S.,
sounded just great to Mr. Bjurman, and
so did last year’s IBM issue (“where
can I get more of that at 7| percent?”).
And he liked the sound of FNCB-
Waltons, GMAC, and Chrysler
Credit. But he won’t be putting his
company’s cash into development pro-
jects where there is no pxofit record or
into ranches, so the AMP can breathe
easily. For Occidental is not attracted
to unproven ventures; and while it
mainly likes fixed-interest securities (and
is a bit cross that convertible notes are
still out of court here), he nevertheless
is keen to look an equity in the face,
particularly if it is in a service industry,
where he considers the main growth in
Australia will be.
In fact, says Mr. Bjurman, prospects
in Australia are so good that, were it
not for the guidelines, Occidental would
be investing something like $l5 million
here instead of $2 million.
AFTER ABOUT half a century with
Myer’s, nearly all of it in Adelaide,
where he was sent from Bourke Street
in 1928 as assistant to Sir Norman
Myer, J. A. “Jimmy” Martin, one of
the hardest-hitting salesmen them
all, has given up the gimmicks. Last
week he stepped down from the
managing director’s post of Myer
(S.A.) Ltd., now wholly Myer owned.
Martin was born in Victoria at
Hamilton sixty-five years ago and got
his formal education at Stawell State
and Essendon High School. At seven-
teen he joined Myer’s in Melbourne,
where he learnt well the Bourke Street
battleground merchandising tactics of
Sidney Myer that eight years later he
was to bring to the hitherto sedate
Adelaide shopping scene. Right to the
end of his reign there, his two main
Rundle Street rivals, John Martin
(from the start) and David Jones’
(which came into the play after snatch-
ing Charles Burke from under his
nose in 1954), found his flair hard to
match.
Events as well as age have crept up
on Mr. Martin. Things were never
quite the same for him after the parent
George Bjurman
Jimmy Martin
company’s successful bid for the
minority shareholding in Myer (S.A.)
in January, 1966, which had been
offered to the public when the Rundle
Street company of James Marshall was
floated in 1856. Being the chairman
and managing director of a listed pub-
lic company and then merely of a
wholly owned subsidiary were two dif-
ferent things. Equally, in the Adelaide
retailing arena itself, Rundle Street has
been losing some of its hegemony to
the newly created shopping centres in
the suburbs, where the competitive
struggle for business demands a more
subtle and less blatant selling approach.
The old Myer guard in Rundle
Street is, of course, still to be strongly
represented by Mr. Burfield, but two
of the other old directors, N. W.
Higgins and D. W. C. Matthews, are
bowing out along with Martin. Woven
in these retirement moves is probably
the most significant recent step of all,
the posting of Mr. B. Glowery as the
new merchandising director in place of
Mr. Higgins. In the top job, Mr. Bur-
field will be looking to Glowery perhaps
more than Martin did to Higgins to
put up ideas needed to meet the chal-
lenges of the merchandising revolution.


investments and institutional loans, the
accounts cloud any attempt to assess
the permanence of yet another third
of the total capital inflow; the loans
being reliable, medium-term affairs ex-
tended by overseas banking concerns
to some of the more established mineral
companies; the portfolio investments-
providing the most unreliable item of
capital involved, and a preoccupying
subject for much current and mournful
speculation. Once again there is no
precedent for assuming that portfolio
funds will be withdrawn overnight, but,
equally, the jump of portfolio-institu-
tional loan inflow from $l9B million
last year to a tentative estimate of $4OO
million this is in itself completely un-
precedented. So there is probably little
point in even considering that, very
roughly, portfolio investment and in-
stitutional loans have stood about equal
over the past two years.
It would certainly be useful for the
Treasurer in doing his budgeting for
this year to have a much better idea
than the published statistics give of
how much of the capital inflow could
undergo repatriation should Britain’s
trade balance take a turn for the better,
should the Basle Agreement take the
pressure off sterling, and should the
U.S. dollar manage to outwit gold.
More importantly, it might help him in
predicting how capital inflow is likely
to fare this current year.
Despite an apparent lack of real
knowledge of what actually constituted
last year’s capital inflow, the Treasurer
is still confident about being able to-
maintain it at a good rate (if not
quite so good as in 1967-68). It would
be more comforting if the published
figures gave more tangible backing to-
his view. Perhaps the Commonwealth
Statistician has some homework to
catch up on.
Speculator’s Diary
BUYING ON BAD NEWS
FOR A ROUGH RIDE
IN THE OIL MARKET
IT TAKES a game man to buy on bad
news, especially in a market as uncer-
tain as ours is right now. But it is the
way to make the biggest profits if
things come good again. And there is
no doubt that there has been bad news
in recent times for the Associated
group, the Alliance group, and Amal-
gamated Petroleum.
Alliance had a failure with its
Thunda well, which was on a favorable
structure in an interesting location;
Associated suffered from the with-
drawal of its impressive partners in its
Bluff coal development, and Amal-
gamated’s Matjara offshore well found
no oil. But there is a real prospect of
better times ahead for these energetic
groups and the current downturn in
their prices could well provide a
useful opportunity to buy-in relatively
cheaply.
The Associated group have come
back a fair way in recent weeks; the
cheapest of them, Associated Contin-
ental Petroleum, got down as low as 37
cents last week having been up to 65
cents not so long ago. But the facts of
the Bluff coal situation may turn out
to be not so depressing as they appeared
at first sight. It is true that the power-
ful consortium of Pickands Mather,
CRA, and Kaiser no longer are inter-
ested in developing the Bluff deposits
into a major source of exports in a
project that would have required huge
capital expenditure. The reason appears
to be that the economics of the field
would not sustain a major operation.
But it also seems quite likely that they
can sustain a much smaller-scale ven-
ture which did not involve such a
large capital outlay (and which would
not interest the Pickands Mather “big
leaguers”). There is nothing wrong
with the coal and it is handy to trans-
port, being on the line to Gladstone,
which is now a major coal-handling
port (Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui’s 4 million
tons a year goes through Gladstone).
There seems a good chance that a
less spectacular (but nevertheless
worthwhile) underground mining ven-
ture than that envisaged by Pickands
Mather and its partners may well be
developed at Associated’s Bluff deposit.
Anyway, Bluff and Dingo are only
two of the Associated group’s irons in
the coal fire. It has two other areas
south of Moura with underground
deposits of medium-volatile coking coal
along with large reserves (possibly 200
million tons) of high-quality steaming
coal, of which about one-quarter would
be suitable for open-cut mining.
Another reason for buying the Associ-
ated group now is that it has gone
through a two-month hiatus in its oil-
drilling program while waiting for a
suitable rig for its next Roma well,
which should spud in late this month.
There is no doubt the failure of
Thunda is a big blow to the Alliance
group’s hopes in the Chandos area of
finally getting more than just the trickle
of oil that first excited the company
in this part of Queensland some years
ago. In Thunda, the group came across
traces' of porosity with oilstaining and
fluorescence and some shale, and,
according to some reports, this was
interesting enough to encourage the
group to consider putting down another
well in the area shortly.
But no matter how excited the com-
pany may still be about the Chandos
area, it does not have the same fizz in
the market as the offshore prospect in
Bonaparte Gulf, which is to be drilled
in only three months’ time. With noth-
ing happening for the group, now could
be the time to buy. The Alliance Pet-
troleum shares look the most volatile
in the group.
Amalgamated Petroleum’s failure at
Matjara means that no- matter how
much interesting information it col-
lected, it will not have another rig avail-
able to do further offshore drilling in
this area for quite some time, even if it
wanted to. So there will be a period of
quiet on its oil front for a while. But
in the mineral field the company’s
highly speculative activities are still
worth a fly (including its stake in Timor
Oil), particularly as the 16-cent con-
tributing shares have come back down
to only 37 cents (having got up to 88
at one stage), which is where they were
long before there was any talk of Mat-
jara.
These three stocks could all go lower
if the market continues to slide, but
that is the risk to be taken in buying
on bad news. But the rewards can be
worthwhile for those who can afford to
hold on and who don’t mind a rough
ride.
This week’s sale was Hilton Cor-
poration, as I took advantage of a little
flurry in the stock following Dunlop’s
bid for prestige to make a $25 profit.
Kitty is now $53 in the red.

THE BUDGET
BOOM CONFIRMED
THE LATEST CROP of statistics be-
fore the Budget will make little impact
on Budget thinking. It confirms trends-
which have already been detected.
Consumer spending would appear to
be rising extremely strongly from retail
sales statistics, for what they are worth.
May and June saw the sales figure rise
from $620 to $636 million, a rate of
growth which amounts to an annual
rate of 16 percent.
New capital expenditure figures for
the March quarter show a slight fall
from the very high level in the Decem-
ber quarter of 1967. Manufacturing in-
vestment is extraordinarily weak, con-
sidering the general state of the
economy. But for a surge in invest-
ment, mining business capital spending
would have lagged badly.
But with the economy entering a
boom period with farm incomes rising
and general consumer spending increas-
ing fast, spare capacity in industry is
bound to disappear and spending on
extensions to recover.

BRIEFLY
The economy: A record capital inflow' of $1159 million
gave Australia a favorable final balance of payments
for 1967-68, and overseas’ reserves improved by $7B '
million despite increased imports.
Savings deposits growth slowed down in the year to
June, particularly in the later stages, due to an increasing
liquidity squeeze and the attractions of other
forms of investment.
Retail sales in the year to June rose 6.3 percent, and,
as consumer price index rose 3.3 percent, the
apparent real growth in retail sales was about 3 percent.
The Federal Government will pay a further $14.5
million to primary producers to compensate for losses
brought about by sterling devaluation. This is over
and above the $34 million compensation provided last
April for statutory marketing authorities of
primary products.
The markets: On Australian share markets oil
continued to weaken, and even industrials slipped. The
non-ferrous section was a little stronger. Peko lost
50c to $l3, Great Boulder shed $1 to $13.20.
Thiess slipped 66c to $4.30, and BHP just managed to
hold its own, at $23.50, after sliding to $22.80, the
lowest price in three months. Great Western hit a record
77c, but finished at 62c, only 7c higher than
the week before.
Amalgamated was hammered down from 97c to 73c
on abandonment of Matjara, Magellan eased
40c to $4.60, Mid-Eastern weakened 7c to 94c, and
Oil Search lost 17c to $1.22. Ampol Ex, perhaps on
rumors of a gas deal with Japan for Dongara production
(officially denied), bucked the trend to add on 5c to $4.20.
Despite the prospect of capital enlargement by the
Prestige takeover, Dunlop strengthened 9c to $2.59,
Lindeman gained 58c to $5.70, and E. A. Greenwood,
favorably reviewed by “Security” at $1.02 in
the July 13 issue, moved up 20c to $1.90.
TNT Ltd. turned out to be the buyer of the 880,000
R. W. Miller (Holdings) shares at $1.45 from a
director of the company, Mr. Robert Miller, who then
resigned . . . There was also a special parcel
of 147,017 H. C. Sleigh shares traded at $1.02.
Indecisiveness continued on the London Stock Exchange
last week, but the “Financial Times” industrial
ordinary share index showed a net rise on the w-eek of
8.5 points. Australian nickel issues took a turn for the
better on Friday with Great Boulder, North Kalgurli,
and Western Mining all in demand again.
In very light trading, Wall Street continued its decline
with blue chips bearing the brunt of the downturn.
To some extent the market was caught
in the crossfire between White House and the
steel industry over price hikes following
steel’s labor settlements.
Companies: Without waiting for Government decisions
on color TV, Electronic Industries announced
it would establish a color television plant at Clarinda,
Victoria, within the next year.
Alliance Holdings announced a 25 percent lift in
earnings. . . . The Commercial Bank boosted
earnings by 12 percent to $2.9 million . . . CAGA
continued the run of buoyant reports from
financiers, with a 16.8 percent profit gain to $2,466,000
. . . Westfield Development hiked dividend
up from 10 to 12| percent when profits rose 49 percent.
Brambles Industries lifted net profit from
$1,954,229 to a record peak of $2,201,013, but dividend
was reduced from 15 to 12 percent on capital
increased by a bonus issue and a par issue
to shareholders during the year ... In a second
handout within a year, J. Fielding announced a one-for-ten
bonus, after profit added $78,000 to a record $903,000.
Hooker’s offshoot, Network Finance, lifted
profit marginally in the June year to $429,000 . . .
Ralph McKay is making a one-for-five issue at
100 percent premium to raise $300,000.
Profit for the June year rose marginally, despite
the drought . . . Lawrenson and Alumasc
got back into the black, but no dividend was declared . . .
In the June half-year Carlton Brewery earned
slightly lower profit . . . The Cahills restaurant chain
increased profit 32 percent from a 23 percent
sales improvement.
Dalgety and NZ Loan profit slid from $4.38 million
to $4.16 million, owing to drought, lower wool prices,
and a loss in the California poultry division . . .
After its two-for-five issue, Dennys Lascelles had to shear
its dividend back from 16J to 12J percent.
Profits are not yet revealed . . . Continuing problems
in its treatment plant gave Renison, the CGFA
tin miner, a loss of $911,000 in the year to June . . .
Even including Brownbilt for the first time,
John Lysaght profit fell 35 percent from $3.9 million
to $2.5 million in the half-year to June, and
directors partly blamed the drought.
Mid-Eastern Minerals filed prospectus, and reported
that one of the largest alluvial tin miners in the
world is doing a feasibility study on large low-grade
alluvial tin deposits near Cooktown, Queensland . . .
Mt. Goldsworthy will supply seven Japanese steel mills
with a further 11.05 million tons of iron ore over
the next 11 years in addition to the existing contracts to
supply 20 million tons over seven years to 1973.

THE LAND
Two organisations seek
to represent
Cinderella in Canberra
CASTING PIGS in the role of Cin-
derella when all along in the national
farmyard they’ve been treated like the
smelly ugly sisters most people think
them to be was only a matter of time.
As any pig breeder will tell you, they
are the cleanest, most kindly animals
on the land and, anyway, this
year the number of pigs in Australia
got over the two million level for the
first time. This won’t make everybody
pig-minded but, for the record, in the
year to March 31, 1968, pigs increased
their numbers by 11.9 percent to
2,018,000; cattle by 5 percent to
19,182,000; and sheep by only 1.7 per-
cent to 166,972,000. There are of course
more pigs in New South Wales than
in any other State, the honor having
been won back from Queensland seven
years ago (Victoria has steadily held
third position for years). What is more,
the pig population is increasing by
far the most rapidly in N.S.W. by
24.5 percent to 640,000 there last year
compared with 14.3 percent to 184,000
in W.A., 8.8 to 509,000 in Queensland,
7.7 to 239,000 in S.A., by 1.7 to 357,000
in Victoria (the pig is a good drought
resister) and stayed at 86,000 in Tas-
mania. To get these figures in perspec-
tive, perhaps it is as well to
remember that in the year to June,
1968, more than three million pigs
were slaughtered in Australia (the
tally to end of May was 2,816,700).
At this rate of slaughter, the average
life expectancy of an Australian pig
would be around eight months.
Pig societies are common to all
States as outworkings of the Austra-
lian Pig Society, but useful though their
activities have been to pig farmers
they have so far fallen short of creat-
ing an image of a national pig
industry. Resolutions passed at the
annual meeting of the APS four years
ago to get the industry better
organised have all until recently led
to very little. Most State branches of
the APS have been content to let things
slip, despite periodic efforts by some
enthusiasts to get the industry out of
its trough. All this is changing. The
Australian pig world is astir.
In several States, moves are afoot
to form commercial pig producers’
councils, with the ultimate objective
of welding them into a national body.
It is stirring in other directions also,
on the research side for one, and in
canvassing the possibilities for exports
for another. The chairman of the newly
formed Victorian Farmers’ Union,
Mr. A. H. Williams, thinks exports
could be the answer to the “extremely
finely balanced” relationship between
demand and supply of pigmeat in Aus-
tralia (supply in the first 11 months
last year was easily a record). Further-
more, he said, “A national grain
policy conducive to full competitive
trading in pigmeats could well be in
the interests of the grain grower, the
pig producer, and the nation as a
whole. All these aspects could well
bear serious consideration and examin-
ation.”
Milk probably being a bit more im-
portant than grain in pig raising, the
producers in Victoria have turned to
the Victorian Dairyfarmers’ Association
(which has so far stood aside from
recent unity moves between farmers’
organisations in the State) to get their
new Council off the ground. There’s
not a grain man in sight. The Council
has the services of the chairman of
the VDA’s pig committee as its num-
ber two man. Its chairman will be
the top man from the Victorian
branch of the Australian Pig Society.
Its new secretary was formerly assis-
tant secretary of the VDA. In outlining
the Council’s objectives, Mr. J.
Treacy, its first chairman, said recently
that they were primarily to have one
Commonwealth organisation to be the
representative body of the pig in-
dustry of Australia. This, he stated,
would “be a body which could make
suggestions on behalf of the industry
to the Federal Government about
all matters including raising funds for
research, promotion, and extension
work within the industry.” Nobody will
have any doubts about what that means.
While the APS seems confident
that organisation of the pig industry
will proceed along these lines, the
move has rubbed the old sores between
the VDA and the Victorian Branch
of the Australian Primary Producers’
Union. The latter has the majority of
the State’s commercial pig farmers in
its ranks (the APS is more for the
stud breeders). Also the APPU con-
siders Federal recognition of the
interests of the pig industry would be
best achieved under APPU auspices
which are in the process of being
greatly strengthened by its mergers
with other farmers’ organisations in
various States. (In South Australia
the APPU has merged with the Farmers
and Graziers’ Association of S.A. The
VFU was formed by its merger with
the Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association last month, and merger
plans are proceeding between the APPU
and United Farmers and Woolgrowers’
Association in N.S.W.) Like the APS,
the APPU has dedicated itself inter
alia toward getting Federal recognition
for the pig industry, but their journeys
to this destination are very different
routes (in fact the APPU’s pig section
will be the fourth biggest in its Federal
set-up as this is expected to develope
on completion of its merger and integ-
ration plans).
AGRISEARCH
SOIL MAPPING
POSSIBLY THE largest international
science congress ever to be held in Aus-
tralia is meeting in Adelaide from
August sth through August 15th. People
interested in soil have gathered there.
They have flown in on the four winds,
with the largest contingent coming from
Russia and the East. There is nothing
political in this; it is just that the
eastern Europeans have always been
deeply interested in soil. Hence the
reason why Russian and Polish words
such as podzol and chernozem occur
commonly in the English jargon of soil
science. The previous conference spon-
sored hy the International Society of
Soil Scientists was held in Bucharest,
Rumania, in 1964.
Several of the delegates arrived in
Australia some weeks ago and many
more will be staying on for weeks or
even months after the congress to have
a good look at our unique soils and
spend working-visits in a number of
our laboratories. A diverse variety of
long and short, pre- and post-confer-
ence tours have been organised for the
visitors besides excursions during the
conference to such localities -as the
Barossa Valley, the Ninety-mile Desert,
and Kangaroo Island. By the time he
departs for home the keen bus-riding
soils man should have a good know-
ledge of Australian farming conditions
and natural resources. As a result, these
intellectuals of opinion makers will
carry back to the four corners of the
earth informed notions of where this
country is heading over the next decade.
Over 300 scientific papers will have
been presented and discussed in
English, French, or German by the
time the congress disbands. (A simul-
taneous translation service has been
made possible by giving linguists a
training course in the technical langu-
age of soil science.) The papers have
been compiled into four volumes, and
a fifth, summarising the discussions,
will be produced after the conference.
The conference itself is divided into
seven major sections dealing with soil
physics, chemistry, biology, fertility,
classification, technology (irrigation,
drainage, tillage, etc.), and mineralogy.
These headings disguise a host of
subjects ranging from the exotic to the


Surprising these days how

homely, all of which draw forth a
veritable torrent of words and virtuoso
display of knowledge.
Besides the practical crumbs of
farming information that fall from the
conference tables, masses of meat for
the scientific stomachs are being served
up. Perhaps the piece de resistance, at
least from the Australian soil scientists’
point of view, was the tabling of the
“Atlas of Australian Soils.” Work on
compiling this fundamental document
started just on a decade ago by the
CSIRO Division of Soils and the last
sheet of the Atlas came from the printer
just in time for the conference. This
atlas consists of ten sheet maps at a
scale of 1 inch to 32 miles which cover
the continent and Tasmania. Each
sheet is accompanied by a booklet
which describes the soils and land-
scapes.
These maps will serve as basic guides
for future surveys of smaller areas in
greater detail and assist in planning
many aspects of soils research and its
application. Indeed, some surprising
practical results have already been
revealed 'by the mapping process. For
instance, it has indicated several new
potential farming or grazing areas that
have escaped the notice of our settlers
and land-developers to date. One such
is the “wet desert” area on the north-
eastern side of Yorke Peninsula, in
South Australia. With relatively little
effort and the correction of trace
element deficiencies, this country could
be brought into production. State
Departments of Agriculture and some
fertiliser firms have already begun
using the Atlas to plan a nation-wide
network of field trials aimed at find-
ing optimum fertiliser rates for
economic plant production on each of
the main soil types.
The criteria used for developing
these maps differs widely from the soil
classification systems used by the Rus-
sians and Americans and so provide
delegates with hot topics for debate.
Long before the Russians introduced
their political revolution they estab-
lished new concepts of soil mapping
which greatly influenced Australian
appreciation of soil types until relatively
recently. The Americans devised a new
system about ten years ago, but our
scientists have rejected it, too. The
great aim of soil mappers everywhere
is to devise a system which definitely
relates soil characteristics to the
economic use of the land. They are
striving to build a firm bridge con-
necting the experimental plots with
the millions of farmers’ paddocks.
The congress does not appear to
have attracted public interest to the
extent one might have supposed in a
country which still leans so heavily on
its primary production. The soil scien-
tists in Adelaide have not merely been
putting on their version of the Olympic
Games. They have been describing how
we may help to hold off Thomas R.
Malthus’ dire prediction, and how we
may use the tools of modern science
and engineering to increase the pro-
ductivity of our soils economically.


INVESTMENT
The Markets
OIL SPECULATORS FACE
PROBLEMS, BUT
NICKEL LOOKS GOOD
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE • OIL TABLE
IT IS EASY to get too sophisti-
cated altogether about the stock-
market. The multitude of reasons for
the dullness of the last few weeks, in-
cluding the suggestion that no one in
Britain cares about investing in August
because of the midsummer holidays,
are all very well. But there seems one
simple, overwhelming reason for the
market easing, particularly in the
speculative stocks. And that is the
absence of good news. Look at the oil
market. Last week there was a collec-
tion of well failures that would take
the steam out of any boom.
First of all, there was no oil in
Amalgamated’s Matjara offshore well,
near Moreton Island, off the Queens-
land coast; Interstate’s Purrumbete
well near Camperdown in Victoria
found nothing; Magellan’s Ravens-
bourne well in west Queensland bot-
tomed out with no success; and Phil-
lips Oil’s Kapuri well, off Papua,
ended up dry. This was simply a con-
tinuation of the run of failures that
has dogged the oil exploration effort
this year. The great hopes that were
dashed at Ashmore Reef and at
Capricorn in the offshore search, and
at Thunda (near the Chandos well that
had discovered a trickle of oil) will
have to be rekindled before the oil
market will recover its lost elan. It is
absurd to look for clever reasons why
the oil market has fallen; finding some
oil outside Bass Strait is what it needs.
The most dismal feature of the oil
market is that the odds are rapidly
lessening that a good strike will be
made in the near future. After such
a long list of failures, the market is
now pinning its main hopes on the
Legendre well, north-east of Barrow
Island, and on the Esso-Oil Search Ini
well being drilled on what is believed
to be the same structure as the Phil-
lips LTramu well that discovered hydro-
carbons earlier this year. If neither of
these bring in good results, the oil
market is going to look a lot sicker
than it does now.
But the history of the search for
oil suggests that it is unrealistic to put
too much faith in the chance of two
wells coming good; not even BHP-
Esso strikes oil every time. The market
has every reason to be nervous. Of
course there are other wells that could
provide some cheering news, but they
are not the repository of such high
hopes as the Woodside-Mid Eastern
Legendre well or Oil Search’s Ini.
What the market needs is something
soon, and there is a real risk that it
won’t get it. Failure at Legendre and
Ini would knock such a lot of steam
out of oil investors that not even the
prospect of an interesting well to come
later on this year in Bonaparte Gulf
would do much to stimulate the market.
For the facts are now clear that look-
ing for oil in Australia is not just a
matter of finding an interesting-looking
structure and drilling it. The almost
automatic successes of BHP-Esso have
blinded the market to the realities of
the search for oil, not only as repre-
sented in Australia but also overseas,
where failure rates are generally pretty
high.
But at least in one section of the
market there has been some good news
nickel. The excellent nickel values
released at the weekend by Great
Boulder and North Kalgurli on their
Scotia lease (curiously enough, London
seemed to know about the news on
Friday) are now making it increasingly
certain that the partners have an eco-
nomic deposit that will warrant a large-
scale development project. The 3.54
percent nickel discovered across a width
of probably 70ft. or so (the drill was
at an angle and went across 100.75 ft.)
backs up last month’s 3.42 percent
nickel across a width of 55ft. from a
nearby hole. These values compare
favorably with WMC’s average grade
of 3.8 percent in its proven ore.
This is the sort of news the market
needs; it adds some interest to those
companies holding leases around the
partners’ area at Scotia. And if this
week’s WMC regular report has the
hoped-for good news on greater
reserves, the nickel end of the market
could well retain its good health,
whether British investors are on holi-
days or not.
SERVICE INDUSTRY
BRAMBLES BREAKTHROUGH?
IN MID-MAY, the Chartist suggested
that the 50-cent shares in Brambles In-
dustries, the Sydney-based transport
group, engineer, and steel merchant,
could continue the rise that had taken
them from 1968’s low-point of $l.OB to
their price then of $1.64, up further to-
a first target of $2.40 and possibly to
an eventual $3. In the meantime, how-
ever, they had to get past a resistance
level around $l.BO and so far they
have not yet managed to do so, with
the shares currently at $1.78.
Brambles, which is getting a bit of a
conglomerate look about it these days,
is well and truly in the category of “ser-
vice industry” stocks that foreign in-
vestors find so attractive in Australia.
And it has the added benefit of sharing
in the minerals boom —as a supplier.
Last week’s percent profit lift by
Brambles, in the year to June, was
at least partly attributable to
accelerated mining activity.
The group is customs agent and
carrier for the Savage River (Tas-
mania) iron-ore operation and has a
THE CHARTIST SAYS: OIL SEARCH LIMITED can still be retained
by investors for further gains. Since the original recommendation in March, 1967,
at 17 cents, prices have already achieved a high of $1.55. It can readily he seen
that at times this stock moves in very fast intermediate trend rates and is basically
a reliable technical “performer.” The current consolidation pattern suggests that
targets of approximately $2.25 and $2.80 are distinct possibilities. Any rise above
$1.50 on high volume would constitute a breakout from the current congestion
area. Last sale price on 1.8.68 $1.29.


branch in the Western Australian iron-
ore country of Port Hedland. Con-
siderable sums of money were spent, at
least in the first half, in providing ser-
vices for the developing areas of
Western Australia.
This is a big area of development for
Brambles, which should get further
benefits of last year’s expansion in the
current period, so that 1967-68’s lower
earning rate and reduced dividend on
capital increased by a one-for-four
bonus and a one-for-eight cash issue
last year should soon be made up.
From 1968 balance date the company
expects to obtain considerable relief
from a lessening impact of the con-
servative policy of providing heavy
early life charges for depreciation of
plant and equipment and amortisation
of property improvement of a
specialised nature.
The 1968 tax provision was again
about 40 percent of pre-tax declared
profit (excluding the income from half-
owned Breckett’s slag metal recovery)
presumably because of further invest-
ment allowance benefits. All of the
profit rise in 1967-68 came from
Brambles’ own operations; its barely
steady investment income (mainly from
Breckett) of $| million dropped from
26 percent of the group’s profit to less
than 23 percent.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA
CEMENT BOOM
ANOTHER industrial company shar-
ing in the benefits brought by the
mining boom is Cockburn Cement, the
Western Australian subsidiary of a lead-
ing British group, whose merits were
forcefully stated last week in London
by the popular “Daily Express.”
British investors are familiar with
Cockburn’s parent, Rugby Portland
Cement, which owns 85 percent of the
Australian company’s shares and are
believed to have soaked up a consider-
able number of the 1.8 million 50c
shares which were placed with Austra-
lian investors at $1.60 in July, 1967,
making for an even greater shortage
of scrip here. The shares have rushed
up to $4.85 this year, although profit
for the year to December last increased
by a modest enough 7 percent.
While cement producers over in the
eastern States, with excess capacity,
have been fighting for the available
business, Cockburn has a near mono-
poly of the Western Australian market
and is protected by distance of 3000
and more miles. The development in
the west is providing greater scope for
growth than anything that the eastern
States can offer.
The 300,000 tons of new capacity
now being installed by Cockburn to
bring capacity up to 560,000 tons will,
of course, not be fully used for some
time, but the chairman promised in
the prospectus that this plant extension
(costing $ll million) would result in
“steadily rising profits (and dividend)
in the years to come.” Already share-
holders have done better than expected
from prospectus estimates of a maiden
15 percent, when 16 percent was paid
out of 1967 profits. Tax savings will
be available at least this year from
investment allowance.
POOR RESULTS
EXPLANATIONS, PLEASE!
IT WOULD be more than helpful to
shareholders and the market if, when
announcing poor final results, as Min-
ster did last week, some explanations
were given of the whys and wherefores
without leaving people to sweat it out
(usually with the market going against
them) until the board has the printed
documents ready for mailing (in Min-
ster’s case this will be five weeks after
the preliminary announcement).
The urgency of an explanation by
Minster is emphasised by the fact that
the interim statement six months ear-
lier was also a poor one, but it por-
tended better things on the horizon for
the second half of the year, a rise in
sales and so forth.
The thing that shareholders know for
certain happened are that their divi-
dend has been halved from the 20 per-
cent paid in each of the last ten years
and that profit for the year dropped
from $996,316 to $612,815, even
though assisted by a remarkably sharp
drop in taxation from $519,915 to a
mere $121,992, a figure which appears
well out of line when related to the
actual profit for the year, and in itself
demands explanation.
The year’s profit being well under
half that of two years earlier, and
nothing said on trading prospects, has
left the market a bit bewildered, especi-
ally as it ran the $1 shares up to $1.70
earlier in the year on the (false) hopes
raised by the interim. The only saving
grace is that the dividend (albeit at
the halved rate of 10 percent) has 14
percent earnings covering it. But the
general disillusionment seems rightly
reflected in the slide in the share price
to $1.17.
POOR RESULTS
BETTER THINGS TO COME
TO SHOW what a good board can do
in giving the background to a poor
result, take Cohn Bros., which has exten-
sive soft drink, farm, and other interests
mainly centred in central and northern
Victoria. There we were told of a drop
in profit from $231,650 to $146,525 for
the year to April 30, although in this
case the dividend was unchanged at 12
percent for the year in spite of it being
only barely covered by earnings of 12.7
percent. Starting off by saying that sales
for the year were in fact steady, the
report went on to explain that substan-
tial non-recurring costs had been incur-
red in modernising and rebuilding the
company’s factories at Bendigo and
Wangaratta, and in developing the farm
subsidiary, Plamble Farm Pty. Ltd. This
expenditure was written off profits last
year, but substantial benefits from it are
expected to help them in future years.
Even so, this exercise didn’t affect the
tax provision, which remained steady for
the year. As the low-earnings cover
would seem to be a temporary phen-
omenon, these shares are worth a thought
on their current yield basis of 8.8 per-
cent.
Mining
SOME LONG-TERM
PROFIT PROJECTIONS
FOR MARY KATHLEEN
IN PRICING Mary Kathleen Uranium
shares up around the $11.50 mark,
investors are not looking to the con-
tract now being negotiated for the
export of 5000 short tons; it can
explain only a part of this price. They
are looking, instead, at the contract
after next, which seems likely to bring
rewards that would even satisfy buyers
at current prices. But it is essential
to realise that this is a longish-term
proposition and that unless the
promised uranium boom of the 1970 s
gets even wider than expected then
MKU’s shares may be unlikely to show
many more dramatic rises on the basis
of uranium unless it finds even
more although rare earths could
add to their lustre.
At present the stockmarket knows
little more about Mary Kathleen’s
uranium export application than that
it likes it. The shares have risen by
about $3 since the company last
month asked permission to export
5000 short tons of uranium and there-
by indicated clearly that, in accordance
with the Government’s rules, it had
proven a further 5000 tons of reserves
at the mine. But what will the contract
really mean to Mary Kathleen
Uranium’s profits and to those of
its 35 percent owner, Kathleen Invest-
ments?
Last time MKU was exporting
uranium, it made a profit of about
$5.70 a pound after mining costs of
$2.80 a pound and amortisation of 50
cents a pound, leaving total costs at
$3.30 a pound out of a contract price
of $9 a pound. This time, the cost
structure is going to be different. In
the first place, operational costs will,
no doubt, be higher, as normal cost
rises over the past five years and more
since MKU stopped mining will have
their effect. On the other hand, the

fact that the ore body is prepared and
waiting for extraction should reduce
some mining costs.
It seems, then, that total costs could
end up not much greater than $3.20 a
lb. And if, as seems likely, the contract
price for the 5000 short tons now for
sale is around $8 a lb., this would leave
$4.80 a share pre-tax as profit. But
pre-tax in 1969 is a different kettle of
fish to pre-tax in 1959-63, when the
Government did not charge tax on
uranium mining profits. That situation
ended in 1965; tax is now to be paid.
So MKU’s pre-tax profit of $4B mil-
lion on the coming contract (if it is at
$8 a lb.) would shrink to about $3O
million after tax (assuming some
healthy depreciation allowances on new
equipment) or about $5.25 per MKU
share.
One striking advantage of this $5.25
per share is that about $4.50 is tax free
in the hands of the investor, as the $25
million in tax paid reserves left over
from the last time MKU was mined can
be distributed this time.
Nevertheless, this leaves well over
half the current price of MKU shares
unexplained by the current contract
even though this contract will take half
of the known reserves of the mine. The
logic behind this is simple, and relates
to the sensible expectation that MKU
will be allowed to mine its remaining
5000 short tons when the coming con-
tract expires (which could be from
three to five years) and that the price
it will get will be far higher than $8
a lb. The mathematics of this are that,
roughly, MKU total net profits on a
5000 short ton contract would rise by
about $1 per share for every $1 per lb.
rise in the price of uranium above the
$8 a lb. likely for the current contract.
In other words, a price of $l2 a lb.
would bring in net after-tax profits of
$9.25 per share. Add this to the likely
per share earnings from the present
arrangements and there is a distinct
possibility that MKU’s uranium alone
will earn it $14.50 per share after tax
over the next seven to ten years—and
it could earn a fair bit more than that
if prices rise much above $l2 in the
19705.
On top of this there is the. strong
likelihood that MKU will begin to
earn substantial profits in the 1970 s
from its rare earths, which it may well
begin producing as a part of its
uranium processing with the current
contract. There is still a great deal of
uncertainty in the group about the
marketing side of the rare-earths
operation, but it seems possible that
each MKU share could have about $5
of rare-earths profits attached to it.
This lifts the possible amount of net
profit per MKU share fairly close to
$2O over the next decade, which goes
close to justifying current prices. And
then there is the prospect that MKU
may find more uranium, although the
chances of this are an unknown quan-
tity. An additional benefit could come
from the rare-earths operation, in that
it could make it worth while for the
company to mine some lower-grade
uranium ore that held rare earths than
now, and so effectively add further to
recoverable uranium reserves.
One major uncertainty about this
sort of projection is that it depends on
the Government allowing MKU to
continue in operation after it completes
the 5000 short ton contract it is cur-
rently negotiating. Under the Govern-
ment’s present policy, MKU would
have to discover a further 5000 tons
before it would be allowed to export.
This seems certain to be changed as
it is clearly unrealistic. There are two
ways the situation could change.
Firstly, there could be so much
uranium discovered in Australia that
the Government no longer needed
a conservation policy (and if Queens-
land Mines comes up to expectations
and if Exoil-Transoil prove up their
large indicated reserves at Mt. Painter,
then we will be part of the way there).
Secondly, the Government seems very
likely to take the view that it would
be uneconomic to close the MKU
plant down again after this contract
and that instead it should mine for
stockpiling, with the Government itself
building up a reserve of uranium. It
is the Government’s conservation
policy; it should carry the cost of it.
But what do all these profit projec-
tions mean to Kathleen Investments,
the 35 percent owner of MKU? The
first contract should result in a profit
entitlement to Kathleen Investment
shareholders of about $1.40 a share
(the bulk of which would be tax free).
The remaining 5000 short tons, if it
were sold at up around $l2 a pound,
would bring in about $2.50 per Kath-
leen Investments share, making a total
of almost $4. And rare earths could
add a further $1.40 or so. So uranium
and rare earths from MKU alone
could provide about $5.30 in future
available net profits per share to Kath-
leen Investments shareholders, who are
currently paying about $6.50 for shares
in a group that also has major mineral
sands interests as well as extensive
interest in uranium and iron ore (the
Savage River).

AWAITING THE RESULTS
OF HARDIE'S LARGE
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
AN OLD favorite for growth and
security conscious investors, James
Hardie Asbestos Ltd., seems destined
for a much improved profit in the year
to March, 1969. Official company
thinking was that 1968 was a hard year,
yet earnings were maintained. This


C.S.R. Co's ANNUAL REPORT
Points from Directors’ Report and Review of Operations
In their annual report to shareholders, reviewing the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd., the Directors
referred to:
• Lower total production from the company’s sugar mills in Australia and Fiji.
• The low world prices for raw sugar and the for an International Sugar Agreement.
• Good progress in the construction work for the Mt. Newman iron ore project.
• The desirability of Australia and New Zealand giving more attention to Fiji.
RAW SUGAR MILLING BY C.S.R.
The group made 793,000 tons
of raw sugar in the 1967 season.
Considerably more is likely to be
made this year.

The Company's Australian Mills
The company’s Australian mills
made 502,000 tons of raw sugar,
19,000 tons less than the 1966 record.
The Queensland mills produced the
same tonnage 'in both years, the
reduction occurring in the New South
Wales area.
In the last decade many improve-
ments have been brought about in
the Australian raw sugar industry.
They have come from deliberative
planning and effort, using cost an-
alysis, followed by the application
of capital, ideas and improved
technology. There have been major
improvements in the quality of the
raw sugar, increasing its market
appeal to buyers. It has seemed
that the most likely area for further
cost reduction is mechanical har-
vesting, with emphasis on clean cane
and on the elimination of delays
before crushing. A further effort in
this area would, if successful, benefit
the industry, and particularly
growers.
For the 1968 season, good crops
are in view, probably making a new
record tonnage for C.S.R. Australian
mills.
Fiji
Due to a third successive year of
severe drought, our subsidiary. South
Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd., made only
291,000 tons of raw sugar in the
1967 season.
The poor “performance” of the
Fiji industry in recent years due
to drought has been a handicap
to Fiji in the current International
Sugar Agreement negotiations. The
actual export performance of each
country has been considered to be
a basic criterion in the negotiation
of the export quotas in any new
international agreement. The fixing
of a quota for Fiji without adequate
regard for the effects of the long
drought would be permanently detri-
mental to Fiji.
Crop prospects for 1968 have
improved a little. Production will
again be less than the normal ex-
pectancy for the acreage under cane,
and less than the capacity of the
factories.
The Australian press has recently
given some attention to Fiji. Fiji is
advancing rapidly in self-government,
and its future course, and par-
ticularly its economic and political
stability, will be of high importance
to Australia and New Zealand. Aus-
tralia and New Zealand have con-
tributed importantly to the relatively
high standard of living and economic
development there through the activi-
ties of this company and others. It
seems certain that Fiji will become
prominent amongst the island com-
munities of the South Pacific. It is
important therefore that Australia,
and in particular the Commonwealth
Government and the press, should
become even more interested in it.
C.S.R. has been in sugar in Fiji
since last century and we can fairly
claim to be mainly responsible for
the industry’s high standards of
efficiency and its sound sociological
structure. We have previously at-
tempted diversification, without strik-
ing success, but some activities such
as beef cattle and rice milling have
continued.
A few years ago we took a share
interest in Fiji Industries Ltd., a
cement manufacturing company.
Recently we have joined with that
company and other interests in a
new company, Standard Concrete
Industries Ltd., incorporated in Fiji,
to make ready mixed concrete and
various cast-concrete products. This
venture fits in with the Government’s
expressed policy.
We have been granted a mineral
prospecting licence over part of Viti
Levu; and we have co-operated with
the Government in trials to determine
whether local phosphate deposits can
be satisfactorily processed and used
in agriculture to replace imported
phosphatic fertilisers.
Good progress is being made with
the housing project to give employees
at Lautoka mill opportunities for
owning houses.
In the sugar industry the incomes
of the millers and growers are still
suffering from the unsatisfactory
world prices.
South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.
buys 98% of its supply of sugar
cane from 15,000 independent far-
mers. The remaining 2% of the cane
is produced on small plantations
owned by C.S.R. which are also
used to develop more efficient farm-
ing techniques. The conversion by
the company in the 1920’s from a
“plantation” industry to one of
small independent farmers was an
important sociological advance.
Salaried career officers engaged by
S.P.S.M. from people born in Fiji
now form nearly forty per cent of
its staff officers. Some of them hold
senior positions and many are
making good progress. All of them
receive in-service training and several
have been given tertiary education in
Australia.
Increasing opportunities for second-
ary education in Fiji, aided by the
98 scholarships now under award by
S.P.S.M., will provide a wider choice
of suitably educated applicants for
staff positions. The number and
quality of applicants will be further
helped by the establishment of the
University of the South Pacific. The
company and S.P.S.M. made a sub-
stantial donation to this university.
S.P.S.M. has so far awarded 14
scholarships to students attending the
university. Our re-developed trade
apprenticeship scheme is an outstand-
ing success.
A recent innovation has been the
“cane development scheme” at Singa-
toka for helping less advanced
farmers to improve their cane
production.
In 1964 we offered to sell at par
to local residents up to 5,000,000 5/-
fully paid shares of South Pacific
Sugar Mills Ltd. The dividend rate
at the time was 7J% per annum
(and has been unchanged since).
800,700 shares were bought by some
1700 local residents. The shares they
hold represent only 2.2% of the
issued capital of S.P.S.M.
It is not our wish that so small
a proportion of the issued capital
should be locally owned and we are
entirely willing in principle to sell
more shares to the public of Fiji on
reasonable terms. However, it will
be fairer to all concerned for this
to be considered again when more
is known of the outcome of the
current negotiations for a new
International Sugar Agreement and
of the consequences for the industry
and S.P.S.M.
GENERAL SUGAR MATTERS
International Sugar Agreement
Negotiations
Every country exporting sugar to
the world market has suffered the
consequences of the very low world
prices of recent years. Consequently
continuous efforts have been put into
the task of attempting to secure an
effective International Sugar Agree-
ment.
About 70 sugar exporting and
importing countries assembled at
Geneva on the 17th April for an
international sugar conference under
the auspices of UNCTAD. Intensive
negotiations continued until Ist June,
when the conference was adjourned.
A resumption of the conference is
tentatively set down for September.
British Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement
Britain and the European
Economic Community
For the 1968 calendar year, Aus-
tralia’s and Fiji’s negotiated price
quotas under the B.C.S.A. are 335,000
and 140,000 long tons respectively.
For these tonnages, each country
receives the negotiated price of
£5tg.43.10.0 f.o.b. and stowed. Fiji
receives an additional special pay-
ment, making the total return to
Fiji £5tg.47.10.0 per ton. The quotas
and prices were fixed for three years
in 1965 and a- triennial review of
them and of other aspects of the
B.C.S.A. for the three years 1969 to
1971 is to be held towards the end
of 1968.
As we have previously emphasised,
the B.C.S.A. is the backbone of the
Australian and Fiji sugar exporting
arrangements. All exporting parties
to B.C.S.A. have made strong
representations to the United King-
dom Government about the serious
prospects which would confront their
sugar industries should the United
Kingdom enter the E.E.C. under
conditions which do not provide
comparable assurances of outlet and
price for the negotiated price quotas.
REFINED SUGAR
Australia: Sales of sugar products
from the five C.S.R. refineries for
the year ended 31st March 1968
were 600.000 tons.
New Zealand: Sales of sugar prod-
ucts by the New Zealand Sugar Co.
Ltd. for the vear ended 31st March
1968 were 142,000 tons. 6% higher
than in the previous year.
C.S.R. BUILDING MATERIALS
The Building Materials Division's
sales and profit rose during the year.
Hardboards Australia Ltd. (50%
C.S.R., 50% Associated Pulp &
Paper Mills Ltd.): The demand
for hardboard has eased recently
after a period of growth during 1967.
Exports continue at a high rate.
Gypsum Products Group: During
the year the Melbourne and Sydney
Gyprock factories have been increased
in capacity and a 'new plaster mill
has started at Yarraville in Mel-
bourne.
C.S.R. Vinyl Flooring Group:
Further embossed Vinylflex floor tile
patterns have been introduced. Com-
petition in vinyl flooring is severe.
An enquiry into the vinyl flooring
industry has been held by the Tariff
Board and the outcome is awaited.
Pyneboard Companies (50%
C.S.R., 50% Australian Paper Manu-
facturers Ltd.): The market for
particle board in Australia is still
growing.
Mineral Fibres Group (85%
C.S.R.): The demand for the rock-
wool insulation of the Bradford
companies continues to grow at a
satisfactory rate.
Hardie-8.1. (50% C.S.R., 50%
James Hardie & Co. Pty. Ltd.):
The demand for Hardie-8.1. calcium
silicate thermal insulation is increas-
ing slowly. The manufacturing
capacity has been increased and is
sufficient to meet the anticipated
maximum market requirements.
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. Ltd.:
1.C.1.A.N.Z. has become the com-
pany’s 'partner in C.S.R. Chemicals
and holds 49.7% of the issued shares,
the holding of the C.S.R. Co. falling
from 60% to 50.3%. The Newcastle
Chemical Co. Pty. Ltd., previously
owned by 1.C.1.A.N.Z., with factories
in Newcastle and Melbourne, has
been merged with C.S.R. Chemicals.
OTHER ACTIVITIES AND
INTERESTS
Distilleries: Sales of most distillery
products continued to edge upwards
throughout the year.
Anticay: The company’s Central
Research Department has developed
a project for the manufacture and
use of calcium sucrose phosphates
(registered trade name Anticay) as
a food additive to inhibit dental
caries.
Gove Alumina Project. Nabalco
Pty. Ltd. (50% Swiss Aluminium
Ltd., 21\% C.S.R., 22J% other Aus-
tralian interests): A feasibility study
for this project was completed on
schedule by Nabalco. It is now
apparent that the alumina plant
should be larger than originally
planned. Some elements of the
project remain to be clarified in the
next few months.
Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd. (50%
C.S.R., 50% Blue Metal Industries
Ltd.): This company does not end
its financial year until 30th June.
Its results for the year are expected
to be an improvement over the
comparable figures for the previous
year.
Mt. Newman Iron Ore Venture.
Pilbara Iron Limited: Construction
work on this large project in Western
Australia is now well advanced. The
first shipments of iron ore to the
Japanese steel mills are due to
commence from Port Hedland in
April 1969. The Mt. Newman project
has a majority of Australian owner-
ship. Our view has been confirmed
that the company’s large investment
in Pilbara Iron Ltd. is a promisimi
one. CSR2B2A

J
year the company is believed to be
budgeting for at least a ten percent
profit increase—and in the first quarter
it was “meeting budget.”
The big factor controlling James
Hardie’s performance is that this year
the company emerges from a period of
great capital expenditure.
Although commitments for capital
expenditure footnoted in the accounts
are not always a reliable guide to the
capital expenditure contemplated, this
year’s figure of $485,000 compared with
$1.9 million in 1967, and $3.5 million
in 1966, suggests a substantial fall off
in expansion. The company says that
there is a very hard core of capital
expenditure necessary every year, but
confirms that for 1969 no single major
unit is on the drawing boards.
The actual amount expended on new
plant is rarely divulged, but gross value
of plant in the books has increased by
$l2 million since 1963, including the
plant acquired in the Wunderlich-
Humes Pipe takeover. This huge in-
vestment is not evident from figures in
the accompanying table, because the
plant is written off so fast that if there
were no new investment in plant for
the next two years, and depreciation
remained as big as in 1968, the plant
and equipment . in the group’s ten
manufacturing locations would be writ-
ten right out of the books before March,
1970.
The net value of depreciated plant
is shown in 1968 accounts as $6,041,000
(about 21 percent of cost) compared
with $9,704,000 in 1963.
The company explains this tradition
of writing off depreciation at far higher
rates than the Tax Commissioner sees
fit, as necessary because of the abrasive
nature of the raw materials used,
which produces severe wear and tear
on the plant. Anyway, it allows James
Hardie to take advantage of new
technology quickly, because the obso-
lescence factor is minimised. (This has
been a great benefit to the industry.
The selling price of asbestos cement
has risen less than any other external
cladding material, for example.)
New machinery installed has a far
higher output than that discarded, and
is significantly more expensive, so that
until demand has caught up with the
company’s capacity to supply the in-
dustry, and until the company is work-
ing on a two shift basis, there is a
digestive period for new capital ex-
penditure, reflected in a tapering off
in earning rate.
In 1967 the chairman said that un-
used capacity of the new pipe-making
machine in Meeanda (Qld.) and of
the new sheet machine in South Aus-
tralia would be fully used in two
or three years. Already the Queens-
land machine is working almost to
capacity, although South Australia has
been handicapped by slow economic
growth. There is spare capacity also
in New Zealand, but not a lot in
James Hardie plants elsewhere.
Accelerated earning rate should result
for this current year.
Tax rates are very high in relation
to declared profits because of the
heavy depreciation policy, and because
N.Z. profits are subject to 50 percent
tax rates. Even allowing for minority
interests, and excluding the $385,000
investment income, tax provided in
1968 was about 56 percent of trading
profits.
Substantial tax relief was available
for a couple of years from losses ac-
quired in the takeover of Wunderlich
Humes Asbestos Pipes Pty. Ltd. In
1966, tax provision was much lower
than usual, giving an exceptional high
earning rate, and this result should be
considered an aberration from the 27
to 28 percent profit rate which the
company usually manages.
In July, 1964, Hardie bought this
joint venture for something like
$900,01/ ’ cash (which it was able to
arrange practically overnight) and paid
the former partners the $1,880,000
which they had advanced to the associ-
ated company. Its manufacturing activi-
ties were then integrated with those of
James Hardie. This was the one assault
on Hardie’s supremacy in the asbestos
pipe industry, and Hardie was the
eventual winner.
Liquidity is a point of pride with
James Hardie, which currently holds
shares and debentures in listed com-
panies, shown in the books at $3,786,000,
compared with market value in March
of $5,050,000. These include debentures
in BHP, CSR, and so on, a 22 percent
shareholding in the Malaysian company
it manages (United Asbestos Cement
Berhad), and a substantial investment
in Cassiar Asbestos Corporation of
Canada, which supplies some asbestos
to James Hardie.
In the year under review it tucked
away $1 million, which was surplus to
the company’s own requirements, in
long-term debentures, although Hardie
could put its hands on this if necessary.
Another, less liquid, investment is a
partnership with CSR, Hardie-BI Co.,
which makes thermal insulation mat-
erials for sale by a CSR subsidiary.
This does contribute to profit, but not
significantly. At 1968 balance date, the
capital and accumulated profits of the
partnership were shown as $567,000.
Although the company has invest-
ments of $5,353,000 and short-term
deposits among current assets of
$2,504,000. Its adherence to this policy
of liquidity is such that in March, 1964,
the company had $1,088,000 in listed
shares and debentures, $3,697,000 in
short-term deposits, yet three months
later the company went to shareholders
for $1,650,000 from one-for-four par
issue. By 1965 balance date the company
still had $2,876,000 in deposits and
$2,006,000 in listed investments, yet in
November, 1965, made another one-for-
four par issue for $2,100,000.
The company apparently would rather
have plenty of fat, and carve off a slice
here and there for shareholders in the

bonus element of a par issue, than oper-
ate on much tighter finances, which
could show vastly improved earning rate.
(Return from book value of listed invest-
ments in the last two years has been
around 4 to 5 percent.) The last bonus
was in a big lump, one for two in
November, 1959. Shareholders might
prefer the tax-free benefits of smaller
and more-frequent bonuses.
Anyway, the company seems dedi-
cated to the idea of a ten percent
dividend, which in recent years has
been varied only in 1964 when payout
was percent, including a 2£ pre-
cent bonus and 1 percent from special
reserves.
Sales were generally better in 1968
than 1967, but higher costs deprived
the company of most of the higher
income. Increased labor costs took most
of the cream, but 1968-69 the company
is already recovering much of this in
higher pi * duct prices.
The next company development will
probably be to move the Queensland
building materials plant from the near-
city location at Newstead out to Strath-
pine, where the company has land for
expansion. It has already provided for
expansion in other States, with vacant
land at St. Marys (N.S.W.), Elizabeth
(S.A.), Spearwood (near Kwinana,
W.A.), Brooklyn (Vic.) and near
Christchurch in the South Island of
New Zealand. Existing plants are at
Camellia (N.S.W.), Brooklyn (Vic.),
Newstead and Meeanda (Qld.), Welsh-
pool and Rivervale (W.A.), Birkenhead
and Elizabeth (S.A.), and in Penrose
(North Island of N.Z.).
James Hardie is not telling what its
product breakdown is, for fear of
helping competition. The pipe business
may have slightly more scope for expan-
sion than building materials. It has lost
some markets to the plastic pipe-
makers in the lower diameter pipes, for
water reticulation, drainage, and sew-
erage. All State factories can supply all
sizes of Fibrolite pressure pipes up to
24-inch internal diameter, and the
company is thinking in terms of much
bigger pipes than that. This will allow
it to have a larger share of the bigger
projects under construction throughout
Australia.
Drought in the eastern States in
recent years should emphasise to muni-
cipalities the urgency for greater
conservation and reticulation of water.
There is a trend to enclosed drains
rather than open channels, for irriga-
tion although the investment is tre-
mendous. The growth in the pipe
market, in the company’s words, has
been “considerable” in the past ten
years, and the future promises even
greater expansion.
The building industry looks particu-
larly healthy, so the market for Fibro-
lite corrugated sheets, flat, and decor-
ated sheets, moulded panels, slates and
shingles, should be buoyant. New pro-
ducts are being designed to open both
new and expanded markets for building
materials.
Friction materials for automotive and
general industries are made by the
partly owned (60 percent) subsidiary,
Hardie-Ferodo Pty. Ltd., where the
remaining 40 percent is held by Turner
and Newall Ltd., parent of Ferodo Ltd.
of the U.K. Ferodo makes available its
research to Hardie, and supplies fric-
tion materials complementary to those
made here, so that Hardie can offer
a complete range to the Australian
market. In July, 1967, the friction
materials plant was moved from Cam-
ellia to Smithfield (N.S.W.). The
brake-linings business is highly com-
petitive, and automotive manufacturers,
beset by problems of increasing their
local content, squeeze their sub - con-
tractors rather than their own margins.
Hardie-Ferodo also provides friction
materials for railways, and earth-
moving equipment, currently much
used in the mining boom. Sales and
profits of Hardie-Ferodo were both
up in 1968, although production was
affected by the move. Current year
should be that much better.

The reduction in the net asset value
of overseas subsidiaries by $697,000
due to devaluation, primarily refers to
the N.Z. subsidiary, so it may be de-
duced that the current book value of
the N.Z. operations is around $2.8
million, at conservative valuation. The
N.Z. economy is not creating a very
favorable climate for Hardie opera-
tions, and future profits will be re-
duced by the amount of the devalua-
tion.
The Malaysian company was prob-
ably profitable in the last couple of
months of its year to June, but would
show a loss for 1967-68, and with luck,
a profit in 1968-69. The building
materials plant was established first,
then pipe-making.
With its prudent system of financing
growth largely from retained profits
and enormously heavy depreciation
provisions, the company’s disclosed
profits and net assets are far short of
their true performance and worth. This
ultra-conservatism could well invite a

MANY INDUSTRIAL
PROCESSES DEPEND ON
JOHN BEITH
SURFACTANTS ARE chemical
agents used to make water wetter and
many manufacturing processes in in-
dustry depend for their success on the
spreading, penetrating or dispersing
effects, which these behind the scenes
chemicals provide.
Apart from their wetting ability,
surfactants have auxiliary properties
such as lubricity, softening, easy rinsa-
bility, foaming or lack of .foaming. In
textiles, surfactants are used in dyeing,
in pigment pastes for textile printing, in
sizing solutions for synthetic filament
yarns, in bleaching, in fabric impreg-
nation. In fact, there is scarcely a single
stage in the wet processing of textiles
which does not require a wetting agent
of some kind or other. Surfactants are
equally important for metal cleaning;
for the soaking, degreasing and dyeing
of leathers; in paints and other pro-
tective coatings; in paper and pulp and
also in such diverse areas as plastics,
pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents,
cosmetics, insecticides, petroleum,
ceramics, adhesives, and so the list goes
on. Apart from wetting agents, the
product range includes defoamers,
soluble lubricants, water soluble resins,
emulsifiers, detergents, metallic soaps,
disperants, plasticisers, fatty chemicals,
stabilisers, tackifiers, and thickeners.
John Beith Holdings is one of Aus-
tralia’s largest suppliers of specialised
surfactants and started life in 1944 on
a paid capital of $BOO. The founder and
current managing director, FI. A.
Koch-Osborne who was one of the two
original partners in the business, had to
borrow to pay his share of the original
capital. The name John Beith was
acquired as a convenient company
title at the cost of $l.
Koch-Osborne, who is half Swiss, half
English, was trained as an industrial
chemist in Sandoz, the large inter-
national Swiss chemical house and be-
fore World War II was manager
of the Japanese branch of Sandoz in
Kobe. Arriving in Australia, he spent
a brief period as a Japanese interpreter
before starting John Beith. Since going
public in 1961, net earnings after tax
have shot up by 98 percent to $218,000
in 1967, eaxnings per share are up by 53
percent over the same period, and total
assets employed up by 235 percent.
Until 12 years ago, the company
operated solely as an agent for over-
seas chemical companies and no manu-
facturing was carried on. But today,
the Bankstown (Sydney) factory, spread
over seven acres, provides possibly 35
percent of group turnover and about 55
percent of group income. The com-
pany is increasing its rate of local pro-
duction (it has about doubled over
the last five years) and is curtailing
its overseas trading, activity, as profit
margins in its own manufacturing lines
are double what can be earned from
trading as an agent for other suppliers.
On a dissection of group profit, dye-
stuffs, finishing compounds, and sizing
materials for the textile trades repre-
sents about 24 percent, plasticisers and
stabilisers for plastics about 20 per-
cent, detergents about 15 percent,
surfactants for paint and other protec-
tive coating, about 10 percent, and
the balancing 31 percent is widely
spread over a large number of other
industries.
The acquisition of F. Brooke and
related companies in 1965 expanded
John Beith’s sales of textile chemicals
and the company is now one of the
largest manufacturers in Australia of
surfactants to the textile industry.
The area showing the greatest
potential in the immediate future
is in the range of PVC plasticisers and
stabilisers, which Beith produce under
licence to Lankro Chemicals Ltd.,
Britain and Argus Chemical Co., U.S.A.
Products in this area embrace epoxy
plasticisers, together with barium,
cadmium, and tin stabilisers, and Beith
is one of the principal manufacturers of
these chemicals in Australia.
PVC is the second-largest volume

The profit growth slowed down in
1966, and there was a rise of less than
2 percent in net income in 1967. The
interim announcement in March, 1968,
suggested a lower rate of profitability
over the six months to December,
1967, compared with the correspond-
ing six months of 1966. It is now be-
lieved that profits for the year to June
1968, will be around the 1966 and
1967 levels, suggesting improved trad-
ing in the January-June, 1968, period.
With the stepping up of the manufac-
turing operations over the last three to
four years, finance costs and deprecia-
tion have taken a toll, and with a sub-
stantial level of idle capacity, profit
margins to turnover has declined. My
hunch is that in 1968/69 the company
will show a return to increased profit-
ability, which should spell sharemarket
growth. This is expected to develop
with the accelerated growth in demand
for the company’s range of plasticisers
and stabilisers.
At $1.12 the shares show a dividend
yield of 6.1 percent and a price earn-
ings ratio of 8.0. Investors who arc
prepared to look ahead for buoyant
profit returns in 1968/69, and ignore
the current static income picture, would
be well advised to put this stock on
their shopping list.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Back home to a climate of selfconsciousness
By SANDRA HALL
KEITH LUBY propped three paintings
against the wall in a particular sequence.
“I am going against everything modern
art talks about,” he said. “I’m telling
a story.”
Luby has, in fact, invoked from Aus-
tralian critics that deadly epithet
“literary.” His work (a selection of
which is reproduced in color on the
opposite page) has even been labelled
primitive, and he’s appropriately bitter
about it. He thinks the Australian
climate of opinion about art is pecu-
liarly selfconscious in its determination
to keep up with international trends
and intolerant of painters beyond its
immediate concern. “Here, there’s a
new academy of abstraction—like the
old English academy under Sir Joshua
Reynolds, and it’s just as afraid of any
disturbance of its conservative state.”
For the past three years, Luby, now
28, has been working intermittently on
a series of paintings and drawings he’s
ambitiously titling “History of the
World” —“a fairytale history,” he
stressed, taking some of the awesome-
ness out of it.
In their starkness and in their power,
the figures in Luby’s drawings slightly
resemble the figures of the young Eng-
lish cartoonist he admires, Gerald
Scarfe. “I’m not against being cartoon-
ist-like. Scarfe is far superior to some
of the younger painters he’s an ex-
cellent draughtsman, and he’s con-
necting himself with the things going
on around him something abstract
painters aren’t doing as far as I can
see.
“There’s a puritanical approach to
art here at the moment, when, what
Australia needs is a Hogarth some-
one to see the absurdity of our condi-
tion. “Hogarth accepted himself as a
cartoonist but history has shown him
to have been an artist.”
Luby, tall and black-suited, has a
vaguely melancholy air, until you
realise he’s a little like his drawings—
the humor is there, looking out a
trifle sadly at it all. “People I consider
have a sense of humor can laugh at
my paintings. Irish irony doesn’t lack
humor, and I don’t think they do,
either.”
Luby went to Europe at 20, after
leaving the National Art School in
Sydney. He spent a year touring
museums, and wondering if insufficient
education made it impossible for him
to understand what was happening in
modern art. Three years later, he
decided it wasn’t.
He spent five years in Italy where
he had two exhibitions (“I was doing
some large paintings then. Probably
because I was living around the corner
from the Sistine Chapel”), then went
to England for two years, returning
to Australia for an exhibition at the
Macquarie Galleries.
“I think some of the young painters
I knew before I went away — those
with a love of drawing — have had
that crushed, in a way, by the feeling
about art here. Interior decoration has
a lot to do with it, because it helps
to perpetuate the fashion. For instance,
hard edge will probably last for a few
years and anyone committed to figura-
tive painting will have it rough.”
Since Luby’s return to Australia last
year, he’s married and rented a small
orchard at Ebenezer, near Windsor,
where he’s working on “The History
. . for his next exhibition in October.
MUSIC/LISA GRANT
IN FROM THE COLD
AUSTRALIAN composers are not yet
beyond the clammy reach of the jingle-
jungle of commercialism, but the
opportunities to write their kind of
music and exist on the returns are im-
proving. Colin Brumby, of Brisbane, is
the latest of them to feel the dry
warmth of support and encouragement;
he has just been signed to a five-year
contract by J. Albert and Son Pty.
Ltd., the music publishers. It is not
an arrangement which will make an
immediate difference to the time he’s
able to devote to composition, but it
offers potentialities he hasn’t had since
he began writing music about 1953.
Since then he has accumulated a
stack of unpublished manuscripts 12
major and minor orchestral works, six
children’s operettas, and uncounted
choral works and pieces for small en-
sembles and solo instruments and
come to earn his support as senior
lecturer in music at the University of
Queensland.
Under the contract, Alberts will have
first option on everything he writes in
the next five years, plus the right to dive
into his large stockpile. Brumby admits
that the publishers “have it a bit their
way,” but as he hopes eventually to
live off his compositions he wasn’t re-
Colin Brumby
luctant to sign with one of Australia’s
two major publishers.
“At the moment I earn hardly any-
thing at all from royalties,” he says,
“and even though the contract means
the circulation of my work will be
comparatively limited, it will be pub-
lished and I won’t have to suffer the
long delays involved in trying to in-
terest British publishers.”
Brumby, 35, has been a prolific com-
poser since attending the Melbourne
University Conservatorium, from which
he graduated in 1957. He has written
for an orchestra of instruments even
while continuing to study in Spain
(under Phillip Jarnach in 1962) and
England (under Alexander Goehr in
1963). He returned to Australia — and
the music department of the University
of Queensland — in 1964 and has
since added such diverse compositions
to his library as “Antipodea” (two
movements for orchestra), three Italian
songs for high voice and string quartet,
and “Gilgamesh,” a setting of a poem
by Thomas Shapcott for chorus,
brass, percussion, and speaker which
was first performed at the 1968
Adelaide Festival.
Currently, he has two operettas —-
“Rita and Dita” and “The Wise Shoe-
maker” — on an Arts Council-spon-
sored tour of Queensland, under the
direction of his wife, Marissa, and has
just completed a satirical operetta,
“Persephone,” designed for school and
other amateur groups. Brumby thinks
there are too few works of that kind
to choose from, forcing amateur groups
to fall back too often on Gilbert and
Sullivan. He is particularly interested
at present in what Alberts broadly
classify as “educational music,” and
some small pieces for children will be
among his first to come off Alberts’
press. His work in progress includes
a violin concerto for solo violin and
a large orchestra of wind and percus-
sion (“that will take me 12 months
to complete”), a piano trio, and two
more operettas for children.

Making theatre for children

lian actor recently returned after 20

ON A Sydney stage where the snapping
social comment of “America Hurrah”
recently was muted, a group of actors
prepare to advance theatre on a dif-
ferent level. They are rehearsing three
plays for children, and they’re more
concerned with cultivating a majority
audience for theatre among young
people than they arc with four-lettered
minority causes which often evaporate
for the lack of an understanding
audience. Producing theatre for a young
generation in Australia is a scattered,
well-intentioned industry, but it’s a
difficult product both to assess and
develop. Catching a child’s imagina-
tion with the fantasy and knockabout
comedy of traditional pantomime is
not difficult, even for amateurs; re-
taining and enlarging the child’s interest
to the point where he becomes intel-
ligently discriminating and eager to
express his acknowledgement of theatre
is difficult, even for professionals.
Since 1964, the Australian Theatre
for Young People has been accepting
the responsibility on that level almost
alone among professionals, taking care-
fully tailored productions during
school terms to children in Queens-
land, N.S.W. country areas, and the
Sydney suburbs. It has adapted old
plays and commissioned new ones from
Australian writers, and regularly pre-
sented school holiday performances for
children in Sydney. Now, for the first
time, it has a theatre it can call a
home. By arrangement with impresario
Harry M. Miller, the ATYP is to have
the use of the Playbox Theatre in
Phillip Street,- Sydney, and their first
production there is being rehearsed
at the New Theatre. Alastair Duncan
has arranged the program—a revue-
type show containing three one-act
plays—under the title of “The Dragon,
the Donkey, and the Nightingale,”
which will play twice daily from Fri-
day, August 23, to August 31, and then
for another six weeks of Saturdays.

OPERA/JOHN CARGHER
HAIR-RAISING PROSPECTS
AT A TIME when any normal opera
company would already have its next
season’s operas in preparation, the
usual tinkle of rumors about next
year’s Trust productions rings a merry
tune which is visually reflected in the
upstanding hair of any opera lover
who hears it. It is hard to know
whether these rumors are activated by
Messrs. Flaag, Young, and Hall for the
purpose of gauging the public’s reac-
tion to their plans. If so, they are
leaving it a little late. But very recent
experience with Menotti’s little number
called “The Saint of Bleecker Street”
(planned and cancelled twice at the
last moment) does make it look that
way.
The operas in preparation are Verdi’s
“Falstaff” and “Un ballo in maschera,”
Puccini’s “Madame Butterfly,” Moz-
art’s “Cosi fan tutte,” Pizzetti’s “Mur-
der in the Cathedral,” and Wolf-
Ferrari’s “School for Fathers.” There
can be no argument about the first
three. “Falstaff” obviously means that
Against all expectations the
management has grasped the oppor-
tunity to obtain Tito Gobbi’s services
as both producer and star.
Although “Falstaff” is not the best
box-office opera, built around Gobbi
it becomes a major musical event w;hich
will ensure sold-out subscriptions no
matter what the other operas are. “Un
ballo in maschera” can be justified
as a superb vehicle for Donald Smith,
who has rightly achieved his own
kind of star status.
The production of “Madame Butter-
fly” should prove to be a local show-
piece, possibly controversial, but cer-
tainly stimulating. Sir Robert Help-
mann has staged “Butterfly” before with
success and only acute stinginess in
costumes and scenery could cause a
failure here.
So far, so good. It is even possible
to argue that “Cosi fan tutte” can be
cast'more than adequately without im-
ported stars and that a beautiful (if
abominable) production complete with
costumes and scenery is in storage.
But do we have to have Mozart every
year? Are there no other composers
whose wares the Trust can revive?
Donizetti? Bellini? Massenet? Or if
these are too “pop” for our arty man-
agement, what’s wrong with Gluck’s
“Orfeo ed Euridice” with Lauris Elms?
The other two works planned are a
different kettle of rotting fish. There
has been clamor for modern works,
and rightly so. There exists at least a
dozen operas written after 1920 which
would rouse tremendous interest at the
box office.
There is ample justification for the
inclusion of Berg, Henze, Weill, or
Britten in the repertoire. But what
wild-eyed lunatic dreams up works like
“The Saint of Bleecker Street” and
now “Murder in the Cathedral”? No
major opera house has tackled either
for years and in the case of the latter
there is not even the redeeming name
of Menotti to fool some poor unfor-
tunate into believing that he will see
another “Consul.”
The production of “School for
Fathers” is almost welcome after such
an incredible piece of planning. Admit-
tedly, Wolf-Ferrari’s little gem has not
been produced anywhere for years, nor
does it have any kind of box-office
Tito Cobbi . .. secured?
appeal. But at least we know that it
is an entertaining and tuneful piece of
nonsense which the Trust’s artists can
perform with their usual elan, and at
very little cost. The public may well
welcome the uninhibited slapstick of
“School for Fathers.” Even so, some
Offenbach, or even Sullivan, would
have filled the bill (and the theatre)
better.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
UNAMBITIOUS AT 50
Generation. William Goodhart. Theatre
62, Adelaide.
THEATRE 62’s 50th production since
formation six years ago is William
Goodhart’s “Generation,” in which a
liberal-minded advertising executive
visits his newly married daughter and
finds her nine months pregnant. She
and her husband are fully fledged
members of the switched-on, dropped-
out generation, complete with beads
and guitars. Demonstrating their con-
tempt for the “system,” they intend to
have the baby born in their loft-pad
without the help of doctors. The com-
edy arises from two situations: the
middle-class father’s inability to under-
stand the couple, and his attempts to
stop the birth taking place in the loft,
which involve his agency’s PR depart-
ment, a doctor friend, and a publisher,
with concomitant satirical points being
made at their expense.
It is a humorous, inoffensive play,
fairly well acted, adequately set, and
even slick in broad terms. In New
York it was a popular success, and in
Adelaide it also tends to be that. But
I would have expected Theatre 62 to
present something a little more am-
bitious for their 50th production.
“Generation” is not an important play,
either commercially or artistically, and
its current presentation has no marked
qualities of production or acting. In
fact, the standard Theatre 62 faults
are once again displayed in a lack of
attention to detail, rough-and-ready
properties, and an absence of really
tightly controlled, well - rehearsed,
synchronous action. With all its excel-
lent facilities, and operating on a fully
professional basis, it is indeed capable
of better things. Perhaps the simple
effort of keeping an unsubsidised com-
pany alive leaves no time for the
director, John Edmund, and his cast
to catch up with itself artistically. It
is time, however, that it took itself
seriously.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
UNDER-REHEARSED
NOBODY COULD say Sydney is
starved for music: a full-scale opera
season has just finished and a ballet
season is in progress, the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra seems to be in per-
manent residence at the Town Hall,
the Sydney String Quartet has recently
completed its packet deal, and Tessa
Birnie is about to embark on a like
series of four matinee recitals which
will trace keyboard music from 1320 to
1967.
Looking back over the Sydney
String Quartet’s four recitals I felt a
little disappointed. Despite the imag-
inative programming, a quartet, a
string trio, and a piano quintet, and
despite the promise of the first concert
there was no sense of culmination in
the series; in fact, the final concert
contained the most wayward ensemble
of any. Could it be that the players
are as badly off for rehearsal time as
they were when they were members of
the Orchestra? All of them are on the
teaching staff of the Conservatorium,
and an extensive teaching practice con-
stitutes hard labor, and is no prepara-
tion for the dedication and the intense
rehearsal schedule which is the sine
qua non of an immaculate ensemble.
The players are sensitive, superbly tal-
ented, and hard-working musicians, but
if their efforts are to be so dissipated
that rehearsal time is dangerously
limited we can forget about our
Quartet rising above a level of solid
professionalism. Surely if the appro-
priate authorities lifted the players’
retainers to a point where work outside
the Quartet and solo appearances could
be confined to the teaching of a few
genuinely talented pupils, the coaching
of student chamber groups, and an
annual master class, this would be a
step in the right direction.
One thing has emerged from this
series for which Sydney’s, not to say
Australia’s, music-loving public can be
grateful: Carl Pini is an excellent
leader and a first-class fiddle player, a
classical stylist yet capable of making
a warm and ravishing sound in the
full-blooded Romantics, in effect an
ideal chamber musician.

CRY-ALONG WITH STEFAN
AS EXECUTIVE director of the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust, Mr. Stefan
Haag can’t honestly be said to have
backed his words of support for drama
in Australia with practical deeds, but
his voice is still of benefit to the cause.
Just back from a two-month study
tour of America, he’s had plenty to
say against the banning by the
N.S.W. Chief Secretary of the play
“Motel” in the trilogy “America
Hurrah” at Sydney’s New Theatre.
Censorship of such a sort, he said,
would make it difficult to show Aus-
tralian audiences the “exciting con-
temporary trend in American theatre,”
not that the Trust showed much
eagerness to dabble in new theatrical
trends even before the banning of
“Motel.”
But Mr. Haag seems now to be an
enthusiastic convert to contemporary
American theatre. One play he saw
in New York was “The Boys in the
Band” which is about homosexuality
and is peppered with several of the
four-letter words which contributed to
the exit of “Motel” from the Sydney
stage. Of “Boys” Mr. Haag is reported
to have said: “You laugh yourself silly
but, by the end of the play, you cry.
I don’t get this often, but there were
tears running down my cheeks. It was
tremendously poignant and marvellous
theatre.”
Dry- eyed Australian theatregoers who
can’t remember when they’ve last seen
“tremendously poignant and marvellous
theatre” should be prepared to cry-
along with Mr. Haag and fight for the
right to do so: “The Boys in
the Band” is under serious consideration
for commercial production here.
Meanwhile, “America Hurrah” con-
tinues to play to capacity houses at
the New Theatre, but with a satirical
sketch called “Hotel” substituting for
the banned “Motel.” And for that
rebellion against the absurdities of
censorship we offer two four-letter
words — well done.
CONSULTATION
TEIE medical profession is not cus-
tomarily eager to chat to the Press,
but in times of crisis it can be as
expedient as anyone with a message
to get across. When the N.S.W. Govern-
ment announced (“Prematurely,” as
Health Minister Jago later admitted)
that the Sydney Hospital was to be
relocated at Parramatta, about 20 miles
away, the directors of the hospital and
doctors might have been unprepared
for such a “horror-shock-drama,” but
they recovered quickly and were soon
fighting back.
With their help, the midday edition
of the “Mirror” on the same day had
found a man who had had a heart
attack in George Street the afternoon
before, and whose story, if Sydney
Hospital were at Parramatta, “might
have been his obituary.” The midday
edition of the “Sun,” meanwhile, was
quoting the president of the hospital
board, Dr. F. L. Ritchie, as saying that
a “life a day would be lost if the
hospital were transferred.”
By the next morning, almost every-
body connected with the hospital had
said their piece, except the patients,
particularly those on the open veran-
das exposed both to Sydney’s climate
and the traffic in Macquarie Street.
Twenty-four hours later State
Cabinet was said to be ready to re-
consider the transfer plan — and, with
or without the urging of medicos, the
Press of Sydney was thundering its
own opposition. The entente cordiale
between doctors and reporters might
have evaporated, but it was nice to
feel wanted, however briefly.
ALL CHANGE
SYDNEY’S two afternoon newspapers,
the “Mirror” and the “Sun,” often seem
to exist in a Humphrey Bogart world
of journalism, scrapping over a circu-
lation area which has become a sort
of blood alley for their stunts, gimmicks,
and “Bid-Quit-Shock” posters. In such
a world casualties come suddenly and
ingloriously, and last week Mr. Douglas
Flaherty joined Mr. Rupert Murdoch’s
growing list of ex-editors. Flaherty, who
began his newspaper career as a photog-
rapher, left the “Mirror” to be suc-
ceeded as editor by English-born Mr.
John Moore, an ex-“Sun” man. And to
complete this latest round of unmusical
chair-grabbing, Mr. Sol Chandler, an
ex-Murdoch editorial executive, has
joined the “Sun.” In blood alley it pays
to keep your options open.
DOUBLE-TALK?
WERE kindly Dr. John Dolittle, the
famed fictional zooglot of Puddleby-on-
the-Marsh, and his creator, the late
English author Hugh Lofting, basically
white racists? This allegation has been
gaining wide credence recently, particu-
larly since the Hollywood film “Dr.
Dolittle,” starring Rex Harrison as the
man who could speak to animals, has
been drawing thousands of children to
picture theatres throughout the world.
Dr. Dolittle, whose rapport with ani-
mals has delighted children all over the
world for nearly a half century, was
actually “the personification of the great
white father nobly bearing the white
man’s burden,” in the view of the
Council on Interracial Books for Chil-
dren, an organisation of editors and
people in the U.S. book-publishing
industry.

DRAWING DEFENDED
Master drawings of the 17th Century,
Etchings by Rembrandt and Van
Ostade. Art Gallery of N.S.W., Syd-
ney.
Sixteen Brazilian Graphic Artists. Rudy
Komon Gallery, Sydney.
ACCUSTOMED as we are to struc-
tural severity or expressive flamboyance
in huge modern paintings, we have
to make an almost conscious effort
to examine the 62 tiny drawings from
the Witt collection and the con-
current display of the N.S.W. Gallery’s
own etchings by Rembrandt and Van
Ostade. Yet the drawings of the 17th
century, Jackob Rosenberg points out
in his recent “On Quality in Art”
(Phaidon), were marked by a sense
of balance, a richness of formal rela-
tions, a surety associated with flexibility
and ease, and a spontaneity assoc-
iated with suggestiveness all terms
that should make these drawings im-
mediately acceptable. But drawing has
come to be regarded as a minor,
inconsequential art, modern interest in
it declining with the eclipse of the
most calligraphic of movements, ab-
stract expressionism.
The facts are, however, that a Dobell,
Constable, or even a Rembrandt sketch
can be superior to a grander, “more
finished” painting, and that a drawing
is a subjective and imaginative notation
about the scene or person before the
artist; it is a playful, cursory skirmish
with what is depicted rather than a
ruminative interpretation of a sub-
ject. The point is made clear by the
etchings of Rembrandt and of Adriaen
Van Ostade (1610-85), who, despite
their concern with the natural, as wit-
ness Rembrandt’s tremendously dynamic
Three Trees (1643) and his Landscape
with Sportsmen and Dogs (c. 1652) and
Van Ostade’s Anglers, the approach is
dramatic and the scene, by the careful
contemplation associated with the tech-
nique, is rendered symbolic. Van Ostade
views his anglers from below so that his
splendidly realised bridge looks like the
insecure bridge of life.
The Witt drawings, which are not
Hands, by Lodovico Carracci. ..
rendered firm and tender by outline
all masterly, are generally serene, sen-
sitive, and subtly softened with the shift
of light; there is, especially in the land-
scapes, a relaxed, ornamental playful-
ness, as, for example, when a drifting
shadow enhances the solidity of cliff in
A Walled Town on a Hill by Gio-
vanni Grimaldi (1606-1680), or when
the fragile foliage combines with the
equally fragile rocks in a landscape by
Paul Brill (1554-1626), who, like Jan
Breughel the Elder and many others,
opens the view beyond the rocky fore-
ground to suggestions of an eternal
panorama.
Decorative embellishment is most
thematic in Landscape with Road and
Figures by Pieter Molyn (1555-1561):
the tiny semicircles that form the float-
ing foliage of the drifting trees are
repeated with accumulative power in
the tufts of grass, and the winding road
is the rhythmical counterpart of the
trees’ silhouette; the horsemen, like the
viewer, approach the scene quietly, and
an open gate leads the eye and the mind
to speculate on what lies behind, but a
tired, sprawling peasant brings us back
to the commonplace reality on which
these works are based. A bearded man
by Jusepe de Ribera (1591-1652) may
be tied to a tree, but you have only
to compare this curious drawing with
Goya’s Disasters of War to realise how
cool the 17th century was, though cer-
tainly Van Dyck’s Brazen Serpent has
a Tiepoloesque, rhythmical play of loose
line and wilful areas of light and dark
in controlled tumult.
One could compare the three figure
pieces by Reni, Domenichino, and Guer-
cino for what happens to drapes on and
about bodies (it is generally thought
that they are best when they suggest
the body beneath, but that strikes me
as a pre-Cezanne criterion) or could
discuss the relation of Pieter Saendre-
dam’s black chalk on blue paper church
interior to abstraction, since Thomas
Hess treats him as a precursor of
geometrical abstraction, or investigate
how Lodovico Carracci’s pair of hands
in soft black chalk are rendered both
firm and tender by outline and both
soft and solid by subtle shifts of light.
But one’s eye constantly returns to a
View of Yssel by Constantyn Huygens
(1628-1697), who uses the conventional
dark bistre foreground as foil to the
frail curves that indicate the flat lands,
shore, and bay beyond. The curves are
cut with horizontal bands that presage
the horizon with its town and ship
beneath a drifting grey sky that lets its
light fall where it may.
In the face of such drawings, the
virtuosity of the Brazilians begins to
look rather mannered, and the prints,
like so much modern art, are too pre-
conceived and too aggressively frontal.
Artlessness seems anathema in the art
of the print-maker, but Rossini Perez
and Anna Letycia do make a virtue of
modernism’s bold positiveness, and
Maria Bonomi achieves some of the
toughness of those masters of the
modern woodcut, the German express-
ionists. More subtle, in a mingling of

THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
DISTRACTING MADMEN
Marat/Sade. Melbourne Youth Theatre,
Monash University.
MARAT/SADE is one man’s internal
debate restated in the most brilliant
theatrical terms, as Peter Weiss weighs
his commitment to the idea of revolu-
tionary change, with all it’s inherent
dangers, against the concept of intellec-
tual detachment and independence.
(“Don’t imagine that you can beat them
without using force,” argues Marat.
“This revolution is leading to the with-
ering of the individual,” counters Sade.)
The clash of ideas is further
emphasised by an unprecedented discord
of styles. As Peter Brook has written,
“everything is put in place by its
neighbor—the serious by the comic, the
noble by the popular, the literary by
the crude, the intellectual by the physi-
cal .. . violence is illuminated by the
cool flow of thought.”
But before insight can emerge from
Charenton’s delirium, producers must
get a degree of dramatic unity from
these opposites. The danger exists that
with 40 madmen on stage throughout
the performance, peripheral goings-on
will distract from central issues. And
this is what tended to happen in John
Ellis’ production.
Where Brook choreographed the
movements of the asylum’s company,
compressing them into tight groupings
obsessively repeating the same actions,
Ellis allowed his cast to wander the full
depth of the stage according to their
loony whims.
On the other hand, Ellis’ production
placed heavier emphasis on Marat than
Brook’s, which seems correct after a
reading of the text. Where Sade won
the film on points, Marat at least drew
the bout on stage. Given a young and
inexperienced cast and a monstrously
difficult play, Ellis achieved a produc-
tion of surprising quality.
Reviewed briefly: “Commitment,” a
one-acter by the Australian playwright
Jack Hibberd, has just had a produc-
tion in Melbourne. It takes us to a
teenage party where the subject of
Vietnam intrudes into the booze and
sex. One of the boys has just been con-
scripted and is subjected to some in-
tense rubbishing, but far from being
bitter or fearful he is, in fact, ex-
hilarated at the thought of escaping
from a job of soul-destroying dullness.
The play includes some nicely carved
cameos and Hibberd’s ear for the local
idiom is as good as Humphries’; his?
humor almost as sinister.

BERTRAND RUSSELL
SEEN AS A MYSTIC
WITHOUT A FAITH
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell,
Vol. 2, 1914-1944. Allen and Unwin.
$6.30.
“THE CENTRE of me is always and
eternally a terrible pain a curious
wild pain a searching for something
beyond what the world contains, some-
thing transfigured and infinite the
beatific vision —. God I do not
find it, I do not think it is to be
found but the love of it is my life
—it’s like passionate love for a ghost.
At times it fills me with rage, at times
with wild despair, it is the source of
gentleness and cruelty and work, it
fills every passion that I have it is
the actual spring of life within me.”
Set in one of those boring literary
competitions, or as a context question
in an Eng. Lit. examination paper, few,
I imagine, would be able to identify
the above passage as by Bertrand
Russell actually in a letter to Lady
Constance Malleson, dated 23rd Octo-
ber, 1916. Yet, surprisingly enough, to
judge by this second enthralling volume
of his autobiography, it is a highly
characteristic utterance. Underneath
his studied exterior of a man of cynical
wit, hedonistic practice, and agnostic
principle, there was at any rate
in those days an anguished mystic.
Especially in his letters to Lady Con-
stance (or Colette; probably the woman
he loved most), it comes out again
and again.
Like all mystics, he was essentially
a solitary, and really quite liked his
life in prison, where he served a sen-
tence in the first division for writing
that American soldiers might be used
to intimidate British strikers, “an occu-
pation to which the American Army
is accustomed when at home.” He
assumed that, in view of the threat of
a revolutionary situation resulting from
the war’s stalemate, when the dough-
boys came over to Europe they would
not be sent to fight the Germans but
to occupy Britain and France. I found
this blithe, preposterous assumption
very much in his vein, and in keeping
with a similar one when he bet me
£2O that Senator Joseph McCarthy
would be elected President of the
United States in succession to Eisen-
hower. Yet how marvellous is his can-
dor about himself! For instance:
“Throughout my life I have longed
to feel that oneness with large bodies
of human beings that is experienced by
the members of enthusiastic crowds.
The longing has often been strong
enough to lead me into self-deception.
I have imagined myself in turn a
Liberal, a Socialist, or a Pacifist, but
I have never been any of these things
in any profound sense.”
He goes on to remark that Spinoza’s
concept of “the intellectual love of
God” has always seemed to him the
highest of all pursuits, but that even
this pale deity has eluded him. “I
have loved a ghost,” he concludes,
“and in loving a ghost my inmost self
has itself become spectral. I have
therefore buried it deeper and deeper
beneath layers of cheerfulness, affection,
and joy of life. But my most pro-
found feelings have remained always
solitary and have found in human
things no companionship. The sea,
the stars, the night wind in waste
places mean more to me than even
the human beings I love best, and I
am conscious that human affection is
to me at bottom an attempt to escape
from the vain search for God.”
It is very fine, very truthful, and
very sad. I know of no other con-
temporary capable of looking at him-
self with the same detachment and
the same honesty—qualities which put
his autobiography in a class of its own;
both the narrative portions, written, as
I understand, some 20 years ago, with
a grace of style from which he has
rarely, even in his most superficial
writings, departed, and the collection
of letters, some of them, like the ones
exchanged with Wittgenstein, very
funny in a quiet sort of way.
It is the same honesty and truth-
fulness that enabled Russell, almost
alone among Left-wing intellectuals,
to realise even in the very early days
that the Russian Revolution was
going to produce results diametrically
opposed to the hopes invested in it by
its Western European and American
admirers. Whereas Shaw, the Webbs,
Laski, Strachey, Julian Huxley, Gide,
and hosts of others displayed a pitiable
gullibility and credulity before the pre-
tensions of the new Soviet regime,
Russell kept his head. His letters
written during a trip to the U.S.S.R. in
the early summer of 1920 are a model
of objectivity and good sense, and stand
out in the voluminous and almost in-
conceivably fatuous literature on the
subject as a bright and shining light.
His time in Russia, he writes, sum-
ming up his impressions in a letter
dated 25th June, 1920, partly owing to
illness but more because he loathed
the Bolsheviks, had been infinitely pain-
ful to him. “Bolshevism,” he goes on,
“is a close tyrannical bureaucracy, with
a spy system more elaborate and ter-
rible than the Tsar’s, and an aristocracy
as insolent and unfeeling, composed of
Americanised Jews. No vestige of
liberty remains, in thought or speech
or action. I was stifled and oppressed by
the weight of the machine as by a cope
of lead.” Some ten years later I felt
exactly the same, but expressed myself
far less cogently and much more
furiously. Russell goes on to argue that
nonetheless the countrymen of Dostoev-
sky have to be governed in that par-
ticular way at that particular moment;
“yet it is terrible . . . the aim of the
Bolsheviks is to make them industrial
and as Yankee as possible. Imagine
yourself governed in every detail by a
mixture of Sidney Webb and Rufus
Isaacs. . . .” Alas, we can imagine it
all too easily.
Another of Russell’s admirable traits
that emerges from his autobiography,
and that sets him apart from most of
his fellow liberal intellectuals, is his
way of applying his principles to his
own personal conduct. Thus when he
reached the conclusion that inherited
wealth was unjustifiable he at once pro-
ceeded to give away his own; some of
it, incidentally, to T. S. Eliot, to whom
he was immensely kind, not only
financially, but in providing him with
hospitality and in helping to succour
Eliot’s distracted first wife. A charac-
teristic effort was made by D. H.
Lawrence to participate in Russell’s
largesse—“Oh, and I want to ask you,
when you make your will, do leave me
enough to live on. I want you to live
for ever. But I want you to make me
in some part your heir.” Lawrence saw
nothing incompatible between this
Russell ... anchorite without a cell?
mercenary appeal and exhortations
like:
“Do stop working and writing
altogether and become a creature
instead of a mechanical instrument. Do
clear out of the whole social ship. Do
for your very pride’s sake become a
mere nothing, a mole, a creature that
feels its way and doesn’t think. Do for
heaven’s sake be a baby and not a
savant any more. Don’t do anything
more —but for heaven’s sake begin to
be —start at the very beginning and
be a perfect baby; in the name of
courage.”
As Russell meekly points out, the
trouble about this program was that,
as he had disposed of his inherited
wealth, if he adopted it he would have
nothing to leave to Lawrence or any-
one else. Russell’s judgment of Law-
rence is about the best I know, apart
from Jessie Chambers’, Jessie being


the original of Miriam in “Sons and
Lovers.” Lawrence, he writes, was
an essentially timid man who tried to
conceal his timidity by bluster. His
ideas, such as they were, were taken
from his German wife, who was not
timid at all; under her wing he felt
safe, and dished her up, snobbishness
and all, as Lady Chatterley. “The
world between the wars,” Russell goes
on, “was attracted to madness. Of
this attraction, Nazism was the most
emphatic expression. Lawrence was a
suitable exponent of this cult of
insanity.”
Russell’s great objection to Lawrence
(whose stimulation he admits) was
that he was full of hatred; he was
a feeble would-be despot who got angry
with the world because it would not
instantly obey his behests and who
hated other people just because they
existed. Lawrence’s excessive emphasis
on sex, Russell contends, “was due to
the fact than in sex alone he was com-
pelled to admit that he was not the
only human being in the universe.”
At the same time, this sex relationship
was so painful to him that he con-
ceived of it in terms of perpetual con-
flict, in which the two persons con-
cerned are attempting to destroy each
other.
Russell’s own personal relationships
were not particularly satisfactory or
happy; he longed for a happy family
life and children, but his various
marriages (except the last, which he
pronounces an unqualified success)
broke up. The reason was the one he
gives that he stood aloof, that
he was a stranger in the world, that
his true gaze was set elsewhere. In the
last resort his love, at times so ardent,
had no roots in our earthly soil. Was
he, perhaps (a strange thought, I ad-
mit), a monk manque, a religious
without a faith, an anchorite without
a cell except for that brief happy
interlude in jail?
I am, of course, in no position to
pronounce upon his great works of
scholarship like “Principia Mathe-
matica”; much of his other writing, as
he admits himself, was pot-boiling to
bring him in some necessary cash. I
feel certain that his autobiography,
though probably put together rather
hurriedly, will stand as one of the
great documents of our time.
MAN OF GOODWILL
By ERNEST BRAMSTEAD
Towards the Further Shore. Prince
Hubertus zu Lowenstein. Gollancz.
$14.70.
THE AUTHOR belongs to that small
group of liberal European aristocrats,
now dying out, who combine zest of
life and ease of manner with a sense
of non-conformity, and a touch of
Quixoterie. Born in 1906 at a family
castle in Tyrol, his Bavarian father,
Maximilian, Prince of Lowenstein-
Wertheim-Freudenberg, and his Eng-
lish mother, Constance, daughter of
Lord Henry Pirbright, parted when
their son was four. There were in-
numerable relatives and family compli-
cations, but they do not seem to have
affected the outlook of the Prince, his
openminded cosmopolitanism, or his
lasting roots in the Catholic Church.
Critical of institutions, Prince Lowen-
stein distinguishes all the time between
the spirit of Catholicism and the
Catholic “Establishment.” Austria,
where he grew up, he writes, “was in
many ways typical of a priest-ridden
country and iater one of clerical fas-
cism. Ambitious politicians, clerics, and
laymen alike most shamelessly misused
the name of Christ for their own pur-
poses.”
In Germany, the Prince maintains,
the record of the Church after 1918
was also “nothing to be proud of, parti-
cularly under the Nazis. The defence
of the Faith was left to the down-
trodden, common - people, and the
refugees, maligned and defamed by
Lowenstein ... the pen proved stronger
‘official’ Catholicism while the Hitler
regime lasted.”
On the other hand, Lowenstein does
not share in the fashionable criticism
of Pope Piux XII, with whom he
had two important audiences. The
first was in 1935 when Eugenio Pacelli,
then Cardinal of State in the Vatican,
listened attentively to Lowenstein’s
story of the activities of pro-Nazi circles
in U.S.A. At their second meeting, in
1949, Pius XII told the Prince, “When
you were here in 1935 you predicted
what would happen.” Lowenstein
thinks that the Pope leaned too much on
the advice of prominent German clerics
and even more of laymen like Franz
von Papen and the high German nobil-
ity. Pius XII committed errors of judg-
ment, but always “acted without fear
or concern for his personal position.”
To me the most interesting part of
these memoirs is the first in which the
Prince recounts the struggle for German
Democracy during the unruly years of
the Weimar Republic. After having
studied law in Munich, Hamburg, and
Geneva, Prince Lowenstein became a
•regular contributor to two leading pro-
gressive newspapers in Berlin. More
important, a few weeks after the Nazis
had scored their first big electoral
success in the autumn of 1930, he joined
the Reichsbanner, a mass organisation
in defence of the Republic. He was
well aware that this meant a break
with his class, a “point of no return.”
At the end of 1931 he appeared on the
same platform in Berlin with the Prus-
sian Minister of the Interior, the Socia-
list Severing, at a meeting organised by
the Republican youth organisations.
Afterwards many of the young people
who had cheered the speakers were
attacked by the police in the street.
Their chief, Severing, had not realised
how much Nazi sympathisers had al-
ready infiltrated the police. Grotesque
to think that the Minister had to go
from one police station to another
to get his young followers released.
By mid-July, 1932, the Republic was,
with Franz von Papen as its Reich
Chancellor, in serious danger. Lowen-
stein and his friends sent a mem-
orandum to all members of the Repub-
lican caretaker Government in Prussia
demanding an immediate proclamation
of a state of emergency in order to
forestall a coup d'etat by Von Papen.
However, the Prussian Premier Otto
Braun and his Minister Severing did not
act resolutely and Von Papen was
allowed to get away with his coup.
“Nothing was done to oust Papen, just
as later on nothing to oust Hitler, while
there was still time.” Yet, in looking
back the Prince is not ashamed of the
little-loved Weimar Republic “with all
its shortcomings, all its unrealistic trust
in the goodness of man, it had been one
of the most decent States in history.”
After Hitler came to power Storm-
troopers were soon to ransack the
Lowenstein home in Berlin and a bene-
volent police officer urged him and his
Norwegian wife to leave the country.
When the shadows of Fascism length-
ened in Austria, too, the Prince went
first to England, then later to the United
States, which was to become his second
home country. Helped by some far-
sighted liberal Americans such as Dr.
Nicholas Murray, the president of
Columbia University, he lectured all
over the States and was instrumental
in creating an “American Guild for
German Cultural Freedom” and a
“German Academy of Arts and Sciences
in Exile” to which belonged such
eminent men as Sigmund Freud and
Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Stefan
and Arnold Zweig, and the Protestant
theologian Paul Tillich.
In 1937 Lowenstein went to Spain.
Afterwards the Left Book Club in Lon-
don published his account “A Catholic
in Republican Spain.” With his stand
against Franco, Lowenstein took a line
similar to that of the French Catholic
philosopher Jacques Maritain. The
outbreak of World War II found the
Prince in Paris. He recalls a depressing

it’s twice as good
picture “of complete helplessness, lack
of organisation, and almost anarchy”
in France and felt lucky to be able to
return to the United States in time.
An indefatigable writer of memor-
andums, he continued to appeal for
causes which seemed rather hopeless at
the time. For instance, in the spring of
1940 he approached the Press and lead-
ing personalities in 'the United States in
favor of a “Save Europe Committee”
with the idealistic sub-title “Committee
for a Just Peace, a Democratic Ger-
many, and a Federated Europe.” Like
St. Simon after the Napoleonic Wars,
Prince Lowenstein can claim that he
spread seminal ideas that were to be
accepted as a matter of course a dozen
or so years atferwards. He also claims to
have contributed later to the defeat
of anti-German Vansittartism in Eng-
land and of the Morgenthau Plan for
Germany in the United States. The
author asserts that the famous speech
by the Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes in Stuttgart, in September, 1946,
which marked a turning point in United
States policy toward the defeated Ger-
mans, was not unconnected with the
influence of Lowenstein’s writings.
Rightly or wrongly, he claims that
in his case “eventually the pen proved
stronger than brute force.”
After the collapse of the Third Reich
the Prince and his Norwegian wife de-
cided not to become American citizens
but to return with the victors to van-
quished Germany. There is an odd
irony in the fact that in 1946 in
Bremen the Prince had to fill in the
famous Fragebogen, the questionnaire
issued by the American occupation
authorities to all Germans in an attempt
to track down Nazis. As German aris-
tocrats were then rather suspect to the
powers-that-be, they must have felt
rather relieved when Lowenstein
answered the headings: “Indicate
highest military rank” with “Kentucky
Colonel,” and “Who was your sup-
erior?” with “Governor Ruby Laffon,
of Kentucky.” Soon Lowenstein was to'
write critical reports on the conditions
in Germany for the U.S.A. syndicate
“National Weeklies.” For a while he
also became a lecturer in history at
Heidelberg University until his new
colleagues, anxious to curry favor with
American administration, denounced
him peevishly for having spoken well
of Bismarck.
Lowenstein continued to remain a
non-conformist when, in 1953, he be-
came a member of the German Diet
in Bonn for four years. Although he
represented the Free Democrats, he
seems to have been aware that he
fitted ill into any Party pattern. Earlier,
with a characteristic attitude of non-
violent resistance, he had brought about
the “liberation” of Heligoland, from
which the inhabitants had been re-
moved by the British occupation auth-
orities for the use of the island as a
bombing target for the postwar RAF.
As a result of Lowenstein’s Gandhi-
like tactics the island was returned to

its population. On the other hand, after
the author had witnessed the revolution
in Hungary in 1956 all he could do was
to criticise the Western world bitterly
for letting the Hungarian freedom-
fighters down.
The book is not without its weak-
nesses. There is too much name-drop-
ping and the last part sometimes
degenerates into a travelogue. In recent
years this traveller with a purpose,
averse to both nationalism and Com-
munism, has, as an unofficial envoy
for Bonn, visited some 60 countries. He
claims to have assisted in bringing about
the reconciliation between the Vatican
and the Greek Orthodox Church, be-
tween Rome and Constantinople, result-
ing in the historic meeting between Pope
Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch
Athenagoras I in Jerusalem.
In 1957 the late Dr. von Brentano,
then West Germany’s Minister of For-
eign Affairs, rejected an offer from
Prince Lowenstein to join the German,
Foreign Service. Brentano informed
him with some equivocation that
“knowing your activities both within
Parliament and outside so well, I have
to tell you ithat men with ideas or
initiative of their own cannot be used
by me in the foreign service.” Perhaps
the decision was a blessing in disguise,
for without it this lively and outspoken
book might never have seen the light
of day.
AMERICA'S WAY OUT?
By RICHARD CAMERON
Pax Americana. Ronald Steel. Hamish
Hamilton. $4.45.
THE TEXT FOR Ronald Steel’s
polemical volume is taken from an
address of John Quincy Adams:
“America is the well-wisher to the free-
dom and independence of all. She is
the champion and vindicator only of
her own.” A radical in the now influen-
tial neo-isolationist school, Steel calls
for drastic pruning of America’s inter-
national commitments and a reassess-
ment of the country’s world role.
Steel believes that the United States
became committed to intervention by a
process of rhetorical inflation. In its
anti-Communist zeal, Calvinist idealism
extended the essentially limited Monroe
and Truman doctrines until the limits
of effective power were far overreached
and the national interest forgotten. As
a result, the country has fallen into a
critical moral dilemma: How can hypo-
critical intervention be reconciled with
American ideals and how can American
values be made relevant to a world
that seems neither to want nor respect
them.
He maintains that America has
neither the duty nor the capacity to
protect every non-Communist country
and that, in fact, the threat of world
Communism is a myth. A firm adherent
of the national interest theory of inter-
national politics, he believes that Com-
munism is so divided it can no longer
be a threat to the United States. The
internal policies of Communist countries
are regarded as irrelevant as long as
they are not actively hostile to America.
America’s network of alliances has,
therefore, become a costly, provocative,
and outdated impediment to flexible
and realistic policies. Both NATO and
SEATO should be scrapped. The for-
mer encourages tensions in Europe,
while the latter has proved futile in its
attempt to contain Communist ideology.
Freed of these “unnatural protector-
ships” both continents would be abD to
move toward home-grown solutions to
their problems.
“Pax Americana” argues for a dif-
ferent reorientation of policy when it
turns to Latin America. In this area
intervention is regarded as permissible,
provided it is confined to trade and
technical help: it must be constantly
aware of the progressive, liberal, and
radical groups, and eschew any form of
military involvement which is, in any
case, self-defeating and contributes in
the long term to Communist success.
Steel is an intelligent and sophisti-
cated observer, widely informed, and if
his book is confined to generalities it is
because of demands of space rather
than superficial attitudes. He displays
healthy suspicion of Soviet intentions,
shrewd understanding about such things
as foreign aid and the appeals of Com-
munism, and on Europe, its current
mood and future prospects, he is pun-
gent and persuasive. Yet there are many
serious inadequacies.
Somehow, America will in the future
be able to recognise cases of “open
aggression” against countries that are
not “feeble dictatorships,” and some-
how America would come to their aid,
not alone but preferably with the
U.S.S.R. or the UN. One’s mind goes
back to Manchuria and Vietnam. It
is just not that simple.
There also seems to be an awkward
tension between his belief in Machiavel-
lian power politics and his tendency to
rely on good intentions and hope.
Realistic up to a point, he fails to take
account of all the possible contingen-
cies. Thus, there is no examination of
a situation such as a muscular China in
the future attempting to isolate the
individual members of the “Asian
Balance” which Steel believes should
replace SEATO.
His redefining of Asia as an area of
“secondary interest” appears to be the
result of a rush to find a way out of
Vietnam. It is not so much that Ameri-
can troops should never go back: they
could return to protect those countries
which come under his fluid concept of
“Community of common values”
(India, Japan, Australia, etc.). But only
when the American national interest is
involved. At the moment, South Viet-
nam falls conveniently outside this com-
munity and this interest.
When “Pax Americana” was written
a year ago, the neo-isolationist position
was becoming respectable. At the end
of this year many Americans may
endorse a diluted version as inevitable.


CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMANS
CELLAR MANAGER:
This month has seen the release of
four different connoisseur Dry Reds,
and these will be followed in turn by
several Hunter River Burgundies and
Dry Whites.
Two of the wines just released were
special Lindeman “cellar” style wines,
produced by judicious blending of
Hunter River wine with wine from
Coonawarra and Clare. They are both
of the 1964 Vintage and were:—
Reserve Claret Bin 2910
Reserve Burgundy Bin 2920
The wines are similar in some respects
in that they both have a complex,
vinous bouquet and flavour and similar
district and varietal characteristics.
However, in style they are very dif-
ferent the Claret being firm and
astringent on the palate, and the Bur-
gundy round, soft and velvety. Bin
2910 is a Show Prizewinner, having
been awarded a Gold Medal at the 1967
Brisbane Show in the Commercial
Claret class.
Another of the releases was:—
Reserve Claret Bin 3011
a 1964 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon
from Clare, South Australia. The wine
has a lovely, soft, fruity, vinous
bouquet, and similar flavor, without
the undue tannin astringency of straight
Cabernet.
The last of the four releases was a
1965 Special Bin Oeillade-Shiraz
Clc ret from Langhorne Creek, South
Australia. Here the Oeillade grapes
have been used to lighten and soften
the fuller-bodied Shiraz fruit, resulting
in a light, fine flavored, delicate, yet
firm luncheon Claret.
Each of the wines released is, in our
opinion, of outstanding quality, repre-
senting great value for money. Each
has been preceded, and will be followed,
by similar wines of different vintages,
maintaining a constant age on the wines
released.

A DRY RED TIDE
IN THE AFFAIRS
OF WINE MEN
FIGURES issued in - Canberra last
week show that the value of imports
of still wines, mostly dry reds, rose
from $424,000 to $775,000 in 12
months. A spokesman for the Australian
Wine Board pooh-poohed this increase
by pointing out that total imports were
only about a quarter of a million
gallons. Well, that’s fair enough, since
the increase in money is only $351,000.
Or 82 percent in one year.
And yet ten years ago the Wine
Board seemed quite happy with a local
sale of about a million gallons of dry
red. Heavy sarcasm, see.
The fact is that too-heavy price
rises and the increasing demand have
resulted in this increase in imports. And
the vintage this year saw the grower
demanding, and getting, more money
for his grapes margins which must
be passed on to the customer. Higher
prices will mean greater dissatisfaction
and this will lead to a search for other
supplies. So, only a quarter of a million
gallons could easily rise to only a million
gallons within two years; half of what
total still wines sales were only ten
years ago.
I just don’t know when the Wine
Board spokesman will start to get
concerned. I feel that within ten years
half our yearly consumption could be
of imported wines. Some say there is
not much the industry can do about
it. Many firms are planting as fast as
they can go, though the equation is a
difficult one. Many say that there
could be a glut of wine one day, yet we
still drink only about three bottles
of table wine per head per year.
I think there is still a chance that
we could become a wine-drinking
nation. Not like the French or Italians,
the two-hundred-bottles-a-year men. But
our consumption could go up to five
gallons or 30 bottles a year, three and
a half gallons more than today.
There is still much need for pro-
motion and communication. There is
also need for a stronger sense of
responsibility and for some far-
sightedness. It is not in the interests of
the industry to lobby for higher import
duties to safeguard higher local prices.
This way you could easily lose
potential wine-drinkers altogether. If
they made too much noise the revenue
gnomes of Canberra could examine the
prosperity of the industry to see if it
could support some form of tax. Yet
a tax on all types of wine would
cause serious hardship to many soldier
settler areas, and you know how
touchy politicians are about them.
The situation is a complex one and
calls for restraint. Restraint on the
part of the seller and also on the part
of the buyer. The latter must realise
that we never had it so good for such
a long time, at the expense of the
grape-grower and wine-maker, and
that those days are gone for ever and
ever, amen.
The situation also calls for a lot
more imagination and, far better,
co-operation between the various
companies. The Wine Board should
have more money to spend on research
into equipment and methods to increase
production. It should also have more
money to increase promotion of less
popular styles that are more readily
available. It cannot afford not to do so.
There are many areas in Australia,
at present unknown to wine-lovers,
which one day will be proudly pro-
claimed across labels on bottles of red
and white. For there is undoubtedly
plenty of room still for the vine, and
thousands of acres of suitable soil with
consistent climate could be utilised
for growing grapes for making into
table wines.
I have a pigeon-fancying friend, a
man who breeds birds for the table
and exchanges some among his friends
for other groaning-board goodies. He
has a friend, an Italian settler now 79
years old, who is a great gourmet and
who is interested in many other facets
of life. This grand old gentleman lives
in Batlow, not far from Tumut, in the
Snowy Mountains complex, and has
been trying to grow grapes for wine
for many years. Only recently has he
had any success. Many vines that were
planted failed, and others thrived to
bear poor fruit. The area is about two
and half thousand feet above sea
level, and there is a moderately high
rainfall. Frost on the one hand and
diseases on the other.
Success was achieved with the
Isabella variety of the genus, Vitis
labrusca. (As against the more
common one, Vitis vinifera, from
which most of the quality wines of the
world are made.) Apparently the
Isabella can stand up to more than
thirty inches of rain, and the vines
were trained on trellises about eight
feet above the ground to avoid frosts.
This year there was a good crop, and
a sturdy red wine was made. The
Italian friends of the friend of my
friend call the wine Clinto, after a
wine of the same style made near
Padua, in Northern Italy. There is
another Vitis labrusca variety there,
originally from America, called Clinton,
that is a clinging cousin to the Isabella,
so their mistake is not a serious one.
I tasted the 1968 red just last week.
It has a beautiful royal-purple color,
quite tremendous. There was some
obvious gas, probably evidence of a
malo-lactic exchange. The nose was a
curious mixture of passionfruit flavor
and nailpolish acetone, and this carried
through into the mouth. The wine is
quite full-bodied and the acid finish
agreeable and clean. But the flavor
was definitely most strange. Which of
the questionable characteristics came
from the variety and which from the

area I have no idea. And since the
vinifera varieties have not responded
and only the Isabella has, it seems we
shall not find out, in spite of the old
man’s search for viticultural truth and
his justifiable delight in making a
drinkable wine.
Many virgin regions exist in Australia
which could produce wine. But I don’t
think the Snowy Mountains area is
among them.
In answer to your many requests I
shall give you my recipe for Pigeon
and Peas. This dish is a damned fine
excuse to open a couple of bottles of
superb old Hunter on a rainy winter’s
night. I mentioned my pigeon-fancying
friend. He lets me have some of the
Carneaux pigeons he breeds and I
invite him over for dinner to try them.
It’s a funny world.
Take a Carneaux per person. (A
Park or Fountain pigeon will do, or
try some other game.) Melt some
clarified butter in a large pot and
brown birds on all sides together with
some diced bacon. Calls for lots of
juggling and drips on the stove, but
who cares, my wife cleans up. Flame
the lot in a generous slosh of brandy
and push the birds around until almost
all the spirit has burnt away. Remove
birds and bacon, stir in two or three
tablespoonfuls of flour, and cook gently
for a while, then add chopped parsley
and salt and pepper. Put the birds and
bacon back, and add a generous portion
per person of fresh garden peas or
those splendid dehydrated packet
peas.
Then add the Cellarmasterly sauce.
This is my secret, he said in a whisper,
a mixture in the blender of all the
giblets and liver, and bits and things
inside the pigeon plus some red wine,
plus some beef stock, or a small tin
of beef consomme (opened). Enough
liquid to almost cover the birds.
Simmer gently for an hour or so,
bubbles barely rising, turning pigeons
once in a while. Remove pigeons,
reduce sauce if necessary, and serve
with small boiled potatoes. It’s magnifi-
cent!
My favorite bedside reading is “Alexis
Lichine’s Encyclopaedia of Wines and
Spirits” (Cassell and Co.). Of the three
wine encyclopaedias I now have, it is
the one to which I constantly refer,
whether to find out if a U.S. gallon is
smaller than the British gallon (it is),
or to ascertain if Schiller Wine, a
mixture of red and white, is still as
popular as it used to be in Wurttem-
berg. (It isn’t.)
But seriously, chaps, there’s just so
much in this massive book. To start
with, nearly 700 pages and each of them
with two columns. Maps, tables, charts.
Ten chapters on such items as the
History of Wine, Starting a Cellar, and
Serving Wine, and including two
splendid bits on The Vine and Wine:
What it is, How it is Made. Five
excellent appendices. And, last and
most important, many thousands of
references.
Lichine is an incredible fellow, com-
pletely absorbed in the world of wine.
(He was once married to Arlene Dahl,
which must have given him some sort
of relief.) He owns two chateaus in
Bordeaux and three vineyards in Bur-
gundy. He has offices in the U.S.A.
and France. He wrote the best-selling
“Wines of France.” He recommends
lists of wines for major hotels of the
world and ocean liners. He is the pos-
sessor of an almost mystical palate that
can classify grape, year, area, com-
mune, and chateau. Right side of the
hill sort of stuff. He dared reclassify
the 1855 Classification. And now this
tremendous effort.
Incidentally, I see that some of his
companies’ wines are in Australia now.
A pleasant, clean Beaujolais, a Chateau
Neuf that needs bottle age, a soft,
drinkable Vosne-Romanee, and a mag-
nificent Chateau Lafite Rothschild
1962, which ought to be at $9 a bottle.
Back to the book. I thoroughly
recommend it to anybody with real
wine interest, and that doesn’t mean
just drinking the stuff. You also need
about $l5. It is worth every cent, by
far the best of these world wine books.
Did you know that GRK is another
name for GERK, a “White Dalmatian
wine, dry, pale yellow in color, with an
individual aftertaste?” I didn’t.


Letters
Wool industry
You have completely missed the point
(8., July 27) of this Council’s criticism
of the constant harping on the necessity
for unanimity of policies relating to
the wool industry. The Council’s
president, Mr. T. B. C. Walker, was
not using “disagreement as a defence”:
on the contrary, he was criticising the
Government for its inertia on the
problems of the industry and pro-
posals put forward for dealing with
them. Of course, the costs problem
has long been recognised as common
to the whole of rural industry. How-
ever, agreement on problems will get
us nowhere—it is action that is re-
quired, and this is where it is futile
to wait for unanimity.
In so far as Government action is
required on problems of the wool “in-
dustry,” as it is glibly described by
those who do not know the structure
of the “industry,” action is either not
forthcoming or is confused or delayed
because of unwarranted concern to
have the approval of the very large
number of growers who produce very
little wool. It is naive to expect the
“industry” to have a common policy
on “major matters of principle” such
as marketing over which even the
experts are divided. On many “limited
and technical problems,” including some
proposals for Government assistance
measures, there is sufficient unanimity
between this Council and the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation for practical purposes.
On other matters mentioned in your
articles, such as freight negotiations,
the Council and the Federation are
parties to the negotiations, and have
been for many years. Your article
understates the drop in the value of
wool production in the latest season.
The figure quoted relates only to the
value of wool sold at auction: the real
drop was $95 million.

What do we know
about Asia?
As the lecturer responsible for Aus-
tralian history (“Mainland and Tas-
manian Studies”) in this university, I
must protest about the libel committed
against my colleagues by your anony-
mous writer in the misleading article
“What do we know about Asia?” (8.,
July 20). The passage I refer to is “ . . .
history departments are the best served
. . . Melbourne seems to be the front-
runner, Hobart tails the field. (Per-
haps they are still preoccupied with
Mainland Studies.)”
Twenty years ago I read history in
this university. Two of my five history
subjects were concerned with Asian
history; one, a second-year subject,
dealt with China and Japan; the other,
a third-year subject, covered Inter-
national Relations in the Far East.
Since then, Mr. G. T. J. Wilson has
added a course on Indian history and
the History Department has added to
its staff Dr. Liew, a Chinese historian
and a graduate of the Australian
National University. The Political
Science Department has two specialists,
Drs. Boyce and Eldridge, who offer
courses on South-East Asia.

Your brief but contemptuous dismis-
sal of the work of this university in
the field of Asian Studies (8., July 20)
necessitates a reply, though of course a
letter cannot hope to gain the same
prominence as your original insult. The
Law Faculty members concerned are
writing separately. So far as History and
Political Science are concerned, Asian
studies constitute a very substantial pro-
portion of our second- and third-year
courses, whilst a significant range of
options are offered in these fields to
honors students. Roughly speaking,
overall course content amounts to above
one-third in Political Science and above
one-quarter in History. The inter-
national-relations studies undertaken in
Political Science indirectly give further
strength, whilst Dr. Fryer’s interest in
African politics adds an important
comparative dimension. It must be
pointed out that the first lectureship
in Asian Flistory in any Australian
university was established here over
20 years ago, with the appointment of
Mr. George Wilson, who incidentally
established early personal links between
this university and the Department of
External Affairs which are still retained
by those who have followed, regardless
of some sharp policy disagreements.
It is also worth noting that a surpris-
ingly large number of ABC special cor-
respondents in Asia originate from this
university.
Any objective assessment in terms of
proportion of teaching and other re-
sources devoted to Asia relative to
total resources of both Departments
must place us fairly high in this particu-
lar academic field within Australia,
allowing that the field generally ,is
underdeveloped. Coverage of historical
and contemporary data is both ex-
tensive and intensive, whilst our various
opinions and disciplinary approaches
are widely representative. Our own
efforts to foster consciousness of Asia
in the community are well supported
by the Adult Education Board and the
Australian Institute of International
Affairs. Our main weakness lies on the
language side, although hopeful signs
are increasingly to be found.
In general terms we welcome ideas
and openminded criticism, but are
heartily sick of being patronised by
those who make no effort to find out
facts. We have a constant flow of
visitors of all types, and may the flow
increase. Tasmanian separatism is one
of a series of myths about Australia
fostered and preserved to support the
self-esteem of a narrow unrepresenta-
tive coterie of literati and semi-intel-
lectuals in the two South - Eastern
States, whose culturally coercive in-
fluence is in need of thoroughgoing
challenge.

On our return to Australia we were
somewhat disconcerted to read (“What
do we know about Asia?”) that in the
incorporation of Asian studies within
existing departments of universities
“Hobart tails the field.” While we
recognise that the University of Tas-
mania may be small in numbers, we
would point out that in a Law School
having a full time staff of seven, three
members of staff are actively engaged
in comparative Asian studies. One man
is studying the interaction of Islamic
and Western legal institutions, and two
others are engaged in a survey of com-
mercial problems throughout the Asian
region.
We fully understand that this infor-
mation may not have been supplied to
you when your contributor made his
inquiries at the University of Tas-
mania. The explanation is simple. The
first man was pursuing his studies in
Cairo, the other two were in Malaysia
organising a seminar on commercial
problems for Asian lawyers.

Student unrest
In Alan Reid’s “Comment” (B. r
July 13) he interpreted present student
unrest as “attempts to enforce by un-
lawful actions views rejected by the
majority on the last occasion they Lad
the opportunity to express their
opinions.” We think Alan Reid ignores
the unique features of present student
demonstrations which distinguish them
from past protests. This is not their
militancy but their focus and purpose.
Past demonstrations were directed at
the public with the intention of sway-
ing popular opinion and thereby in-
fluencing Government policy. Recent
Gallup Polls show that public opinion
has become increasingly opposed to
the Vietnam War and its adjunct, the
Government’s policy of conscription.
But Government policies have not
responded to this change as might have
been hoped. Changes in public opinion
seem to have been ignored by the
Government altogether.
For these reasons recent student “sit-
ins” have not been directed at changing
public attitudes. Nor have they been

of autocratic laws that demand many
of them to fight, kill, and perhaps die

Students who participate in “sit-

disregard the inalienable right of the
individual to abstain from adding to
the “violence” which our Government
condemns in Australia but condones

were a true democracy its laws would

Greece's Colonels
On the surface, Mr. H. B. Gullett
(8., July 27) makes a fairly good
apology for the present Greek regime.
On looking closer, one is appalled by
his attitude to life. He does not believe
the “ —more serious charges” against
the Junta, but assumes that “official
murder, illegal imprisonment, beatings,
and torture—” may exist there, as
they probably do in “Hungary,
Indonesia, Ethiopia, China, and almost
the whole of Africa.” He believes that
the Greek people have done best under
the dictatorships, but admits the
Colonels have made many mistakes. “
notably in removing too many capable
men because of their political opinions.”
He does not elaborate on this fact to
show that a large proportion of
academic staff at both university and
school level have been dismissed and
the children of those whose politics
are disapproved of by the Junta are
no longer able to obtain an education.
Mr. Gullett’s confidence in the find-
ings of the British Parliamentary
delegation was not shared by many
English newspapers. Indeed, the
members of the delegation may not
have seen any torture, but they were
dependent on an interpreter for most
of their information and, strangely, they
seem to have accepted the fact of
imprisonment without trial of hundreds,
possibly thousands, of people for over
a year, without question.
Police brutality by way of beatings
is acceptable to Mr. Gullett and,
according to him, not considered
torture by the Greeks. Mr. Gullett’s
main point of argument appears to
be that the Greek Junta is no more
repressive or cruel than Communist
dictatorships and therefore should be
acceptable to us: I cannot accept
dictatorship by either Left or Right
and had I read nothing other than Mr.
Gullett’s article on the present Greek
Government, it would stand condemned
in my eyes.

Opera House organ
I think that Mr. Sutherland Smith
has overlooked (8., July 27) my mean-
ing on the subject of Baroque-type
organs and their suitability for the
Opera House. Unless my understanding
of the potential use of the Opera House
is wrong and it probably is, as . no
one does seem to have any clear idea
as to its precise function it is my
understanding that among other more
cultural uses it will also be used for
conventions and various social func-
tions. Under these conditions, I cannot
imagine, say, a convention of pharma-
cists or engineers being greatly enthusi-
astic at the idea of a recital of purely
Church music. Similarly, if the hall is
to be used for a social function I would
imagine that Gershwin would be pre-
ferable to Bach.
Mr. Sutherland Smith asks what type
of organ I have in mind. That is easy;
a complete dual-purpose instrument
which can be supplied with two con-
soles. One console for straight recital
work, and the other for what will un-
doubtedly be its greatest use —namely,
entertainment. Organs of this type have
been installed in municipal auditoriums
throughout the world.
There is little purpose for installing
a single-purpose concert recital organ as
we already have such an organ in the
Town Hall. It is not merely a case
of accepting either “this or that,” as, if
it were, one could put up a good case
for a “mighty Wurlitzer” as the
Opera House is much more a theatre
than a church. But, why be so inflex-
ible in either direction, when with a
little commonsense planning we can
have the best of both.

Should they hang?
Peter Samuel’s review of “The Penalty
is Death” (8., July 20) is based on
the same misconception on its origin
as that of the writer. The Law as
given by God, an eye for an eye, was
basic only, for the eye of an old man
could not be of the same value as that
of a young man, for obviously the
oldster had had the use of his eye
over many years, whilst the younger
had only begun his use of his eye. So
a system of payments for damages was
brought in, as is the case today. How-
ever, in the case of murder this was
clearly disallowed: see Numbers 35;
31, Ex. 21; 12-17, Lev. 24; 17, Deut.
19; 11-13. There can be no doubt
whatsoever but that God Himself re-
quired the death penalty carried out.
To say this is “old hat” is wrong, for
Christ Himself said, “I come not to
destroy the Law but to fulfil it.” He
continues, “not one jot or tittle of the
Law shall pass away.” Again He said,
“Do not think I shall be the Crown
Prosecutor at your Judgment, there
will be one, Moses, even he unto whom
the Law was given.”
Man brought in the “twelve men
tried and true” in recent years; it was
not always so. The Law required a
Judge only; up to the Court door I
could offer Joe Blow my hand and
say forget it, old boy, let’s go home,
and that would end that; if, however,
Joe Blow killed me, he, in doing so,
deprived himself of the only person
on the face of this earth who could
forgive him. There you are, you have
Barry Jones, Peter Samuel, and The
Book of Life; make your choice: there
can be no fence-sitters when Moses
gets to work, he only knows one
Law.

Rural industries
Is it not an “unnecessary and pre-
ventible cost element” (8., July 20)
when wages have been raised several
hundred percent, while living standards
can be, and have been, raised by only
a fraction of that amount. Nor when
prices of local manufactured goods
have been raised by a similar amount
without any increase in their value?

Tippers made from Comalco aluminium out-carry,
out-last other metal bodies!
Name the load blue metal, coal, sand
or loam an aluminium tipper beats other
materials hollow! You benefit from greater
durability, longer life, maximum resistance to
abrasion. Comalco aluminium is rust-free,
and there’s virtually no maintenance
needed. Profit from the experience of
Brambles Industries. Their aluminium tipper
shown here has travelled 25,000 miles in its
six months’ life to date, averaging 9 cwt.
extra payload per journey. This means
that 5,625 additional ton/miles have been
gained over a tipper constructed of
conventional materials. They’re getting
cleaner load discharge, faster turn-around
and lower fuel consumption. Makes sense to
choose aluminium? They think so. Contact
the Transport Industries Representative
at your local Comalco Sales Office for
