A Lesson on Pedigree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was reading in a society magazine some
graceful remarks about a young cub’s peerless (or
Deerful) pedigree, that he was related through his
paternal grandsi re to General This and through his
maternal grandma to Lord That, and ever so
many more baubled nonentities by this line and
that lino, with offshoots like spokes in a wheel.
L if have two parents ; my two parents each have
two parents, or four between them. Ihus 1 have
four grandparents, who each have two parents
unless brother marry sister), or eight between
them These eight grandparents similarly have
sixteen parents win are my great-grandparents
and so on. Here is an equirational progression of
nnrents with two as the ratio governing the
s P erie thus-2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
*o4B', 4096, 8192, 16,384, 32,768, to infinity
This beats all to flinders the one-grai n-of-wheat-
for-the-firstriiail-in-the-horse s-shoes problem, but
before I proceed to discuss that let me air some
family pride. I have traced back my family-tree
for 20 generations, and, among other curiosities, I
have discovered that I have, up to that date
iust 2 097,150 direct ancestors, with unlimited
side - relatives in the nature of aunts and
uncles and cousins, &c. Further, that one
of my great-etc-uncles was hanged for high-
treason ; another was a person of the John
Knox style; a whole shovelful were massa-
cred at Glencoe ; some of my present clan-kith are
fat men with votes for “ Thrift ” and much beeves
and land ; several got baubles more or less Brum-
magem in the past; and, by dropping down side-
lines from pretty women who were “no better
than they ought to have been, ’lean claim kinship
with Royalty (!), and Jersey, and Lady Munro,
and Wat Tyler, and Joan of Are, and the Duke
i>f New York, and Moll Flanders, and others too
tedious to mention. Never did I realise so feel-
ingly that “all the world is kin” and that we all
ought to have baubles and coronets and golden
coaches and morganatic wives.
I respectfully make the suggestion to Her
Gracious, my 295th cousin by blood, that these
trifles might be made a matter for Time Payment;
that, on the hire system, and to forfeit if pay-
ments are not kept up, I might own a throne and
a crown and a sceptre and a Great Seal and
several votes for “Thrift” and all accessories—
that, in fact, any poor relation who chose to take
the Time Payment system at his own risk might
become a potentate for a year, a month, a day,
an hour, or per minute. This is merely a sug-
gestion, but an improvement on the savage
scramble and fire-and-slaughter system of some of
my indirect ancestors.
* # *
Consider the hard and paralysing enigma
laid bare by these considerations.
Every man who ever does become an ancestor
and not an extinct scion, generally manages that
feat before he is 25. Therefore, a century repre-
sents four generations. A thousand years, 40
generations; and 6000 years, the Ohristianly
alleged age of the world, 240 generations.
Let the mathematicians work out the sum of
the equirational progression of: —
2,4, 8, 16, . . . 237,_ 238, 239, 240,
and find the total number of direct ancestors every
living being has got, according to dogmatic
Christianity.
Here, saving errors in multiplication and addi-
tion, which really do not affect the gigantic total
worth a fleabite, it is—a number expressed by 72
figures—
-339,394,241,516,501,247,18!), 557,155,028,561,791,776
567,952,989,569,576,575,669,497,513,853,950.
How can one express that figure ? Another
digit and it would be some unital three quad-
rillions times three quadrillons. Or can the num-
ber be styled “ Three-hundred-and-thirty-nine-
thousand, three-hund red-arid-ninety- four undece-
millions?”
Moulty fowls of “ the aristocracy,” who brag
disdain of anything “ common,” take huge pride
in “ancestors,” the common stock of all. If any-
one slunk up back-alleys and side-shoots of
pedigree like the. society gabbler who shocked
me with his prattle of the “ well-connected ” cub,
the very meanest might link on to Queen Victoria
as an offshoot of some royal connection.
# * #
What of orthodox ideas ? If Adam and
Eve were the only living human pair when the
Eden apple was chewed, what about my millions
on millions of ancestors? I make this a personal
matter, but every man must see that the farther
he harks back, the more ancestors he digs up.
Who can stand by and see, without a protest,
his duodecimillions of revered dead wiped out by
the ruthless iconoclast, and all his reminiscent
rights desecrated ? I never stood in my marble
halls and rhapsodised over the armour of my sires,
but I aver that my figures are the unfailing out-
come of a natural law, visible to all mankind to-
day.
It follows, then, that the earth’s population
can’t increase, but must dwindle to (probably)
Campbell’s “ Last Man.” Humanity evidently
began with a big swarm of ancestors, and has
been decreasing ever since, for every son patently
has two more ancestors-than his father had before
him.
We must look, therefore, for the swarming ant-
beds of humanity in the past, and not in a future
which can never present as many numbers as its
ever-doubling 72-numeraled ancestry.
I want the mathematicians to study this
matter, and to give a diagram to show at once to
the eye the dimensions of the world’s population
as it is now, and as it was when those duodeci-
millions of ancestral Adams delved and their
Eves span. Will they make that diagram like an
inverted pyramid, with posterity stringing out of
the point-end ? Or like an hour-glass? Or like a
chandelier pendant, with a bulge (maximum) in
the middle and tapering off (minimum) at both
ends ?
They’ve got to explain away my ancestry before
I’m satisfied.
The learned societies should take it up. They
cannot avoid a direct challenge. Let them wrestle
with the figures as I have done, and, if they are

SELECTED OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
ON THE
SUMMER ANNUAL.
DAILY CHRONICLE. —“Mr. Phil May is an artist of whose work, at its best, we could
not easily have enough. Therefore his name attached to the latest among the annuals at once
lends it interest. You would look through Punch week after week in vain for anything funnier
than the expression of the lady in the railway carriage who sits underneath the huge trunk,
which its owner tells her reassuringly has ‘nothing in it that'll smash.’ ”
DAILY TELEGRAPH.— “ It is not often that a publication intended for popular holiday
reading musters such an array of literary talent as that brought to bear on ‘ Phil May’s Illustrated
Summer Annual.’ The Annual contains 126 pages of matter, and may be fairly pronounced one
of the most attractive publications of its kind ever issued.”
ST. JAMES’S GAZETTE.— “We know of no more attractive shillingsworlh than
< Phil May’s Illustrated Summer Annual.’ There is a good deal of variety in the ‘ artistic merit,
of course ; but at least everything is interesting. Most attractive of all to many readers will be
Mr. Sala’s gossip about Dickens at home at Gad s Hill.”
NEWCASTLE CHRONICLE.— “ ‘Phil May’s Illustrated Summer Annual’ is published
at one shilling, and would be belter worth 31J. 6<L than most of the three-volume novels at
Mudie’s.”
PALL MALL GAZETTE.— “ Mr. May, who gives the name to this venture, is an
extremely clever and original caricaturist.”
NATIONAL OBSERVER.— “ Mr. May is before all things an artist. Not only does he
draw with knowledge and expression, but also he generally contrives to catch a decorative aspect,
and to extract a marvellous deal of colour from his simple medium.
DAILY GRAPHIC. —“ If merit is any criterion of longevity, then it may safely be pre-
dicted that it will stay. Mr. Phil May’s reputation as an artist is so independent of praise or
criticism that it needs no more proclaiming than good wine, while with regard to the literal)
side the Editor has been very happily inspired.”
STAR. —“ Mr. May is responsible directly for the clever and humorous sketches in the
book, and has chosen the contributors, who include some of the best short story-tellers of
to-day. ”
REFEREE. —“ Would be a good shillingsworlh if only for its clever illustrations.’’
SPORTSMAN.— “ I should like to recommend ‘Phil May’s Summer Annual’to every
reader of the Spoilsman. Never was so good a likeness of Matthew Dawson drawn ; while
the Duke of Westminster, Mr, Arthur Coventry, Lord Alington, Sam Loates, Joe Thompson,
John Bull, etc., are limned to the life with just sufficient exaggeration.”

A North. Queensland Temperance Story.
“ENOUGH TO SICKEN AN ALLIGATOR."
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
Anyone who knows the Goram River, North
Queensland, is aware that it simply swarms with
alligators. That is to say, it used to swarm with
alligators until Dick Transom began his anti-
alligator crusade. Which crusade had its origin
in the fact that they had eaten his mother-in-law.
At the crossing of the Goram there is a stone
causeway. On the up-stream side the water is
shallow; on the down-side there is a bottomless
hole which formerly was fairly alive with
saurians. Old Rumblepeg, who kept the shanty
on the west bank, was partly responsible for
this. Men who had sampled his notable ## * were
constantly walking over the edge of the causeway,
and so the alligators were as fat, lively and tame
as young kittens.
“They were all fly-blown, poor chaps ! ” Rum-
blepeg would cheerfully remark of the victims to
misplaced confidence. It was a cheap, safe and
thoroughly reliable graveyard ; cremation was “ a
fool to it.” -
It was, unfortunately, on this side that Tran-
som’s mother-in-law fell out of the buggy as he
was driving her up to the station on a visit to her
daughter. 111-natured people remarked that the
accident happened immediately after she had
announced her intention of residing permanently
with them. Anyhow, she was in the back seat of
the vehicle, engaged in giving her son-in-law
valuable advice, when the near hind wheel went
over an extra-big boulder in the causeway, and as
at the same moment the off-one plumped into a
hollow —the poor old lady, with but a small
piece of her mind delivered, took a sudden header
into the fathomless pool from which, needless to
remark, she never emerged.
The worst of it was that as she took the fatal
plunge she instinctively clutched at whatever was
nearest, which happened to be a leather hand-bag;
and, of course, the hand-bag went with her.
Transom might have spared the one, but he had
forty horse-power reasons for not losing the other.
It contained a cash-box holding many articles
of value. In the box was his mother-in-law’s will.
She was a lady of temper, who quarrelled with
her eight children in rotation and duly appointed
the reigning favourite of the hour as sole legatee.
Now, as just then Transom’s wife held that
enviable position, it was imperatively necessary to
recover the will. Again, the ancient dame, who
was old-fashioned in her habits, had some valuable
jewellery which she always insisted upon carrying
about with her, and there were papers of Tran-
som’s own in the box, without which he might
one day find himself in Queer-street.
It will thus be seen that although Transom, in
a vainglorious way, made out that he was
avenging the death of his mother-in-law, in
reality he was searching for the lost handbag in
the interior of an alligator.
He went about his task systematically. At the
lower end of the hole there was a rocky bar of
some breadth, and here he stationed men to watch
day and night, keeping fires burning during the
dark hours. By this means he anticipated con-
fining the guilty “crocks.” to the hole until he was
prepared to deal with them. A messenger was
despatched to town for dynamite cartridges, and,
meanwhile, Transom and one or two < ther good
shots sat on the bank and stalked alligators. It
was extremely tantalising. The very first ’gator
shot contained a bunch of keys, which Transom at
once recognised. Then, although they got many
strange relics, nothing more appertaining to the;
deceased lady came to light.
At length the messenger returned, and the bom-
bardment commenced in downright earnest. The
sport was splendid, and as the news of what was
going on had brought all the inhabitants, black
and white, to the spot, there was an animated
scene on the banks of the usually lonely Goram.
Alligator after alligator turned up its toes, or
floated, stunned, to the surface, to be dragged!
ashore and slaughtered ; but although enough dis-
membered fragments of the late lamented were
found to furnish forth a respectable corpse,
neither handbag nor cashbox was forthcoming.
The inference then was, that the bag was repos-
ing quietly at the bottom of the hole, and as no.
more alligators appeared, dead or alive, Transom
tried to get the blacks to dive for it, but of this
they fought shy. It was just possible that one or
two reptiles had escaped, and, if so, how about
the diver? Meanwhile, the festering carcases
exhaled a pestiferous odour, and old Rumblepeg
was coining money. The collected remains of
Transom’s mother-in-law were decently buried and
things were at a standstill.
It was rumoured amongst those gathered about
the crossing that there was an alligator of enor-
mous size still dormant in the hole. He was a
well-known character, and all were certain that
he was not included amongst the slain. One hot
evening Transom was up at the shanty moodily
thinking about abandoning the search when,,
whether instigated by the stale fumes of the bar
or not, an idea entered his head, which he at once
proceeded to put into execution.
A bullock had been killed that night, and he
procured a good sized leg of beef.
“ I am going to fish for that old alligator,” he
explained, “ and I want to give this joint a good
penetrating smell.” So he got some of Rumble-
peg’s rum and soaked the beef therein. Next day
he stood it in the sun, and by night you could!
have smelt it across Torres Straits against a nor’-
west monsoon. Half hopefully he took it down
and plunged it into the deep pool. “It is my
last card,” he thought.
The stars were paling when Transom awoke
with his usual “head” on him. However, he
arose and proceeded to the river to see the result
of his ground-bait. By the time he reached the
pool it was broad daylight, but nothing was.
visible either on the surface or on the banks.
Disconsolately he was about turning away when
there was a movement in the water, and he slunk
down and watched. A low sand-spit was in front
of his post of observation, and on this the largest
alligator he had ever seen slowly and unsteadily
dragged itself. Waddling across the wet sand it
laid its head on a stranded log and groaned with
such fervency that Transom had to groan in
sympathy. Then it banged its head against the
log in a dismal, reproachful sort of way, as much
as to say, “No, I’ll never, never touch it again;
nothing shall ever tempt me.” Presently, with
much more moaning, it laid its head on the log in
such obvious agony that the sympathetic Transom
hadn’t the heart to shoot.
After about five minutes spent in repentance
and good resolutions, the alligator seemed to be
taken worse ; it got up, swayed about on its short
legs, gave a mighty heave, and there on the sand
lay the long-sought hand-bag.
Rumblepeg’s rum had beaten the dynamite.
- The sick alligator crawled feebly to the water’s
-edge and slowly disappeared. Transom hastened
Sto secure his property, and returned to his cam'p,
but ever since that eventful morning he has been
&, cast-iron teetotaller.

MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE.
OEI3INAL and BEST TONIC. OFTEN IMITATED. NEVEB EQUALLED.
Captain Fisher, Stipendiary Magistrate, writes " I have used MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE,
and I am convinced that it is a valuable therapeutical agent possessed of excellent Tonic properties.”
Captain Heselton, J.P., Chairman Port Jackson Steamship Company, writes: — “For many years I have
used MARSHALL'S TONIC NERVINE, and I can therefore personally testify to its many excelle it strengthening
properties. I may say that I have also, on many occasions, presented it to the employees of Ihe company, and always
with the most beneficial results. I conscientiously consider it to be a most invaluable Nerve and Brain restorative, a
thine which even the robust sometimes require. I gladly subscribe my name to endorse the merits of a remedy like
MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE.”
J. M'Farlane, Esq., M.L.A., writes“ Havine been a great Sufferer from INDIGESTION for a number of
years, and having used a number of remedies without relief, I was persuaded to try MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE,
and after three weeks’use all symptoms of Indigestion have vanished, and in my case all that is claimed for your
Tonic has been fully borne out, and I can confidently recommend it to all those similarly afflicted.”

SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1593.
Public Notice.
The Bulletin has long advocated the sup-
pression in Australia of all titles of so-called'
“nobility,” and as every movement must
have a beginning, it has now resolved, to
definitely commence the process of abolition.
This paper intends from this date tb systema- ■
tically ignore in this country all Royal and
Imperial “dignities” of every description.
If the example spreads, which it certainly
will, and the system becomes universal
throughout Australasia, where the great
mass of voters is Republican at heart,
then Royal and Imperial dignities, so far as
these provinces are concerned, become
extinct in one act. A title which commands
no recognition is, to all intents and pur-
poses, non-existent. The possessor of genius,
learning, artistic capacity, or any other
mental endowment may be independent of
external recognition ; if his qualities are not
acknowledged by the outer world he can
reserve them for his own consumption, and
extract as much gratification from them as if
they were announced in letters of gold on a
monument forty storeys high ; but the
holder of a title whose “honour” no one,
save himself, will notice, is, as an enhandled
dignitary, utterly and absolutely extinguished.
His distinction is merely so much ink and
oxygen, and if the public will not use the
ink in writing it or the oxygen in uttering it,
then it is as entirely dead as if it had never
been. Its owner’s position is then exactly
the same as that of the Dutchman who
owned a tulip when the tulip mania was
over, and the bulb which was once worth its
weight in rubies had dropped to the value of
a commori onion ; or the possessor of an
“old master” which proves to be a mere
oleograph ; or the lunatic with an imaginary
kingdom, and straws stuck in his hair in lieu
of a crown ; or the Tichrorne claimant; or
Sebastian ot Portugal when he returned
from Africa to claim his throne, and, failing
to prove his identity, became a beggar and a
vagrant wailing over his lost glory, and
liable to be arrested as a pauper of unsound
mind.
« # *
The Bulletin takes this new departure
for various reasons, one of them being its
profound pity for titled Australians in
general. The Austin an is the outcast of
the “ nobility.” The B.itish politician, even
of the fourth-rate variety, may aspire to a
hereditary peerage ; the most able of Aus-
tralians can only look for a title that the
tenth-rate Briton would kick away in scorn.
No British politician is ever offered a mere
khighthood-Mt is a recognised fact that the
meanest of his kind would jump on such a
patent of nobility with both feet ; but the
“colonist”is often offered something even less
than that awful “dignity”—the C. M.G.-ship
was invented as a still cheaper degradation
to tit cases where a whole knighthood is too
large and lavish an honour. Thu “colonist”
is the Chinaman among title holders—the
nigger who is rewarded with bead necklaces
and red cotton handkerchiefs; and he is sub-
divided into the good nigger who gets a big
red handkerchief, and the inferior one who
gets a smaller and less glaring clout, and the
really bad nigger who gets no rag at all.
But whatever variety he belongs to he
regains a nigger to the bitter end, and he
never gets beyond the bead necklace and the
red handkerchief. This is the last and
worst of the many insults that* are heaped
upon him. A dukedom .or a marquisate is
as distinctly a mockery as a C.M.G.-ship,
but the person who has a soul for gilded
mockeries, and yet is content to grab
for the smallest and poorest of the lot is
doubly an object of contempt. The man
who scrambles through countless intrigues
to, b.e an emperor or a sultan is not to be
envied, but the man who scrambles as
desperately to be a parish beadle is—well,
what is he ?
# # •
The democratic title of “Mr.,” which
belongs equally to the millionaire and the
gardener, is more honourable than all the
“ distinctions ”■ in the Royal gift. The man
who is “created ” a marquis is placed in
that position obviously because he is not good
enough to be a duke, and considering the
material of which some dukes are made the
inference is not flattering. The individual
who is created an earl is so situated because
he is not good enough to be worth creating
a‘marquis ; the viscount gets his “ honour ”■
because he is not worth making an earl, the
baron because he is too mean to bp qualified;
as a viscount, and the baronet because he is,
not worth making into the poprest kind; of
peer going. ' Then comes an assorted lipt of
various kinds'of knighthoods more oy less
esteemed, with St. Micha el and St. George
about the bottom of the, catalogue, each,
knight being a poor ; common, earthenware,
object which isn’t of' sufficient account, eyen
to be made into a baronet ; and last of all
come sundry dregs calledj “Companions”
who are such because they are deemed, too
low* even for a knighthood. The Australian
wlio receives ah “honour’” is so carefully
ahd definitely informed, while getting it,
that he is too common and cheap and;
degraded tp deserve any one among so many
other honours that he becomes an
aTmbst too far dpwri eyen for pity., He has
to struggle throhgh such a long list of ipsiflt-
ihg comparisons to arrive at his “dignity ”
that any self-respect He ever possessed mu,st
be pretty nearly extinct by tW time be gets
there. The difference’between the ILO.M.G,
and any Vvell-cohdhcteti individual who is
blessed,With rib distinction whatever is easily,
defined ; the latter is declared by his want
of a title 'to be as' good as 999 but’of
every* 1000 of his fellow-meii, while the
former is deckled, by his title, to
be a vast amoiint worse than several
thousands of other persons whose names
anybne can find’ih Whitaker’s Almanac.
Which differehed comes to very much the
saine ad that between an ordinary man'and,
a very superior prize hog. '
# # *
In the attitude which it lias resolved.to
take up, The Bulletin' is guided strictly
by British precedent, and, to tile average
K.C.M.G., British precedent is a holy thing
and practically infallible. It lias’ already
been decided in England that an 'individual'
with the Australian prefix'of ‘ l _Hon.”‘ is
“ honourable ivithin the colony'”, only ; 'out-
side the country where his title was con-
ferred he is 1 not hohourable. ' Therefore,
The Bulletin concludes that the person
who gets a K.C.M.G.-ship front England is '
a K.C.M.G. in England only, and'it proposes
to act accordingly. ; Therd ard nkny titles
coming from sources ad Imperial and as
venerable as Victoria herself which the
British crown absolutely ignores ; the mar-
quisate conferred on Patrick Jennings by
the Pope is a ease in point, which dignity is
treated with derision, despite the fact that
the Pope is a sovereign ruling over a wider
empire than any Guelph ever commanded ;
and when this paper proposes to place
Jennings’ Roman and his English title on
the same level, it thereby hopes to do
equal justice to two founts of so-called
“ honour,” whose distinctions are equally
hollow and equally foreign to the democratic
spirit. In these pages for the future,
the Roman marquis will be Mr. Jennings
only, and the latest K.C.M.G. will be once
more plain Mr. G. R. Dibbs as he was before
the Fall, when the woman tempted him and
lie did become a knight. And The Bulletin,
in so describing them, will mean much loss
disrespect than it did in the days when it
published them in all their garish magnifi-
cence. It will even feel comparatively
friendly towards the hairy Foreign-trade
poet when it describes him once more as Mr.
Henry Parkes, and forgets, for the moment
at least, that ho wrecked any prospects of
greatness he ever possessed by becoming a
knight of the order of the perjured extor-
tioner of Cappadocia.
The rule which we here set up for our own
guidance applies, of course, to purely arti-
ficial distinctions only. Such individuals as
Primate 8. Smith and Cardinal Moran are
excepted, because their titles are merely
professional descriptions ; the one is a bit hop
and the other is a cardinal by trade, each
pursuing a lawful calling by the use of a
“palace” and certain pastoral crooks and
other tools, after the manner of ordinary
artisans. Premier Bhiels, Judge Owen,
the Pope, Chief Justice Madden, and
various others come into the same cate-
gory, Further, the rule docs not apply to
European title-holders, that country being
apparently incurable. But Australian Im-
perial “ honours,” which are “ honours ’’and
nothing else, will no longer bo recognised in
this paper under any circumstances whatso-
ever. Some day, however, The Bulletin
will perhaps begin to confer knighthoods and
C.M.0.-ships on its own account, its au-
thority for so doing being simply that
it feels that way inclined, which is exactly
the same authority under which Victoria
dispenses her patents of nobility, and the
Pope scatters unrecognised marquisates
throughout the earth. It will do so with a
full knowledge that titles are a hollow sham
and a degradation, and it will bestow its dis-
tinctions only in quarters where a good,
reliable degradation seems to be urgently
wanted and where it promises to do the
most harm.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Chinese Strike.
About 350 Mongolian cabinet-makers were out
on strike in Melbourne last week, and the local
Standard, with glaring inconsistency and the
true spirit of a ground-down Chow, seizes upon
the opportunity to cast lumbering sneers at the
local Trades Hall people, and to demonstrate
that the Celestial clod who allows himself to
get caked with filth and to contract spinal
curvature in the, franfic pursuit of 20s. a week
is a superior creature, t,o ( the white unionist,
taking, him “ by andjlaygq,” and is a person to
beencoupged, Says tjhe. Standard :
The “ labour trouble,,” in Little Bourke-street, ought
tp serve as a useful lesson to,the European leaders as tp.
now to handle the spike weapon. The Chinese are firm
tlie disagreement between master's .and men has lasted for,
a fortnight, yet there ha? one defection from the
raiiks of the latter. And they a}-e held together a, united
body without apy lorry oratory, wjthqut picketing, with-
oyt boycotting, without brass bands, rvijfiout prpcessipns,
and without fluttering the redjflag,bf, anarchy.
The, Standard, being a, humhlp. and icon trite,
instrument in the,, hapds of a, gang of scratch
capitalists, woufd rather haye, stewed, in, its,

erroneous. On the, contrary, Cat is. a, self-

“from 30s. to £2' a, w.eek, with bpard and
and it is against “ a redpefion, in, flijs,

heathen has struck. The, evening paper, fol-
lowing its usual custom in strike capes, went to.
the boss Chows for its figures. As a matter of
fact, all Mongolian cabinet-makers are on. piece-
work, and -the soulless Celestial who earns 30s.
a week is that gnarled horror clad in a loin-rag
and a cake of abomination, caged in an awful
den off “ Lillie Blurke-street,” whom you will
see, if you peep through the chinks of his shop-
walls at any hour of the night or morning,
working like a galvanic mummy with hands
and feet and teeth—it never stops, it is never
seen eating, and is never known to sleep. The
paper that holds this “patient worker ” up to
the admiration of all men evidently thinks the
average Christian would be improved by fol-
lowing the customs of the Celestial. All this
misplaced admiration will lead to no good. The
end of it will be that a deputation of thankful
lepers will come round to express its grati-
tude to the Standard, and will clasp the board
to its infected breast with fatal results.
The Rape of the Bauble.
Thanks to the jealous virtue of Campbell,
M.L.A., the Victorian Legislative Assembly
barely avoided making an ignominious ass of
itself last week. Campbell,- in his reckless
innocence, armed himself with a copy of the
Ballarat Courier, and read from it a crude
paragraph concerning Matthew Davies’ mace,
to the mingled amusement and dismay of his
less apostolic friends in the Senate. This para-
graph was evidently the clumsy work of one
who had brought but little real knowledge to
bear upon a very dangerous subject. The writer,
after a vague reference to “festive cusses”
taking the mace from Parliament House, stated,
as a fact, that it was “ even now ” in a brothel
and being “freely exhibited to clients,” etc.
Furthermore, the inexpert journalist solemnly
reprimanded the Government for allowing the
bauble to remain in such unholy company, and
condemned the police for not bringing the
“ festive cusses ”to justice. The embarrass-
ment of the (Government when Mr. Campbell
droned forth these aspersions on the collec-
tive character of the Legislature was quite
pitiable. Chief Secretary M‘Lean and Premier
Sitiels each felt deeply ashamed of the Bal-
larat Courier, but were neither of them pre-
pared to punish the newspaper right away.
This was strange, yet, stranger still, their
inconsistency met with tin* approval of sages
like Duncan Gillies, while the Speaker ruled
that the Government had nothing to do with
the matter. Then the patriotic Campbell, in
a state of “profound astonishment”-—poor
lamb! —moved that the publisher of this
appalling libel bo called upon to answer for his
blasphemy at the bar of the House, and the
House gave an uneasy, half-hearted assent. A
certain dread of hearing what the offending
publisher had to say for himself seemed to tem-
per the general indignation. As the event
proved, however, the elderly gentleman in
question had nothing to say in support of his
organ’s allegations, and with his abject apologies
forhavingprinted one harsh word about the mace
this delectable incident was dropped like a hot
potato. The editor, his employe, who, it is
understood, would have asserted the truth of
the published statement and defied the House
to do its worst, was not called at all. The
Victorian Assembly derived what satisfaction!
it could from a bald statement that the Courier
had based its article on erroneous in,formation,.
How much or how little erroneousness* was
being apologised for nobody ventured; to enquire.,
A point which immediately strikes every critic-
of this farcical comedy is the. fact that it leaves,
the mystery of the missing mace- quite undis-
turbed. Matthew, Davies’ mace, was taken,
from its case.. J'here. we- have, a, great fact
poetically expressed, The- police, have prose-
cuted nobody for stealing t,lie. precious thing,,
yet the. Chief Secretary offer® to, supply
any honourable member (in, private), with,
any mace, information that is in, the depart-
ment’s possessipn, Wjhatis the “ information”’
which neither t,he police nor the Government
will; djyulge to an anxious world, and, how, cauig,
if, that, M/Lean could say “ every hon P member
knew, there wasn’t a, tittle, of truth, in. the.
statements ” of the. Courier, though, the.
theft, of the ipace has not, bqen charged, against
apyone ?. Where are- the. Government A proofs,
that the, baubjq. never fpund its way tp a,
brpthel ? Apd why did the Hon,, M,‘Lran, call
the. Ballarat Courier am unmitigatedi liar,
whilst his chief, Supers, deprecatediithe-hauling
of the newspaper over the- coals,, because “it
Would, never do tp act precipitately,, and
perhaps place -the. House in, a, false,or ridiculous
ppsitjon.iiyso .doing” ’!■■ W.hati a,hopeless tangle
of professed ignorauep-ambasserted,knowledge!
Npw, Thi; Bulletin, issipformed thafci Matthew
Davies's, has been in, a. ‘‘house of ill-
fame,” particularly well-known to the Mel-
bpurpe, detectives.,
Ip the .merry, Victorian Parliament last week, a
member, begged to. draw attention to the case
of a.young man, who, had! been sentenced to 17
or 18 years’ imprisonment for breaking into a
church, The late governor of Pentridge gaol
had previously drawn, the, member’s attention
to this ghastly illustration of bigotry, or stupi-
dity, on, the, judgment-seat, but now, for the
first time only,, was. it publicly suggested that
the poor devil had been shamefully over-
punished,. He took nothing out of the church,
andi was probably half an idiot for thinking he
wpnld, find anything to take, yet he is doing
hfs long “ stretch”’of time, while the bloated,
scoundrel, G., N.. Taylor, who cold-bloodedly
ruined scores- of people, serves a modest four
years in, the., cosy billet of prison librarian.
Nevertheless, Taylor is not so well off but
that, he., has- cause to complain. In the course-
of ani,eye-opening discussion, it was stated that
a, man,, whose offence was the murder of his.
Wife,, “had been spirited away to England by!
some means !’* And the utter indifference with
whjch, the House treated this last revelation,-
spoke, eloquently of a legislative willingness to«
let other criminals, be spirited away to England,,
if, necessary..
Dr. Maloney, of the Victorian Assembly,
asked Premier Shiels whether he couldn’t
kindly appoint three Judges, in place of a jury,
to. try the Mercantile Bank directors, and
Shiels said that the Government, was “ not
prepared to take steps to abolish trial by jury.”
Seemingly an absurd question answered in a
contemptuous spirit. Yet if Maloney had un-
covered the meaning which dictated his enquiry,
one might have found a pointed significance in
vS iiiels’ reply. In the meantime, The Bulletin
wonders whether the Mercantile Bank directors,
if committed, will be in constant communication
with their jury, as happened with the Premier
Building Association crowd and their tribunal.
Colonel Templeton has exposed the “ careless-
ness ” of the Crown in that memorable case, and
the question now to be considered is not as to
whether the Government will abolish trial by
jury, but whether it will take steps to prevent
another judicial scandal.
Captain Sanderson, of the steamer Gulf of
Siam, how in. Sydney, gives, in Sydney D.T.,
an interesting report of the “New Australia’
region. The captain claims to have five years
experience of the country, and has even taken
out emigrants to the Promised Land. The fol-
lowing are some of Ins views ;
The cOuntry as far north as- Bahia Blanca is ;*■ complete 1
desert, the predominating features being thorn-bush and
sandy soil, and there is no rain, except a little which
falls during one or two months in the year. In 1885 I
took out a number of passengers to a place called KiO
Chupat, a rivulet running from the Andes into the South
Atlantic, about 200 miles south from Rio Negro, which I
understand to be the site proposed for founding this set-
tlement 06 “New Australia.” There bad previously been 1


„ Welsh colony established there in 1862, by from 800 to
1000 Welsh immigrants. They landed at Nuevo Uulf, and
iT.e nut to such straits that one-half of them died before
, hpv ,‘ot to the little valley of Rio Ohupat, which they
pvoected to make their home. The rest were only kept
bv the aborigines, who hunted for them over the 50
of desert which they had to traverse in order to
■each Bio Ohupat. . . . The inducement for this first
nlmiv was that each immigrant received 240 acres in the
r'hnnat Valiev through the Argentine Government.
Agents were sent over to England to talk it up, and get
.wvmle to "'0 out and build a local railway from the Rio
f'imint to Nuevo Gulf, a distance of 50 miles. The
Hrst lialo'i of immigrants in response to this movement
consisted of 200 who went out in a Liverpool steamer,
rim same inducement was held out to these immigrants
to the Welsh in 1802 ; but as the good arable land was
so limited, when they got there they found it all taken
rm and they were left with only the desert to face. There
A 1,,,) redress, seeing they were on foreign soil. Some
staved to work at the railway, but they were kept under
conditions worse than the vilest slavery. I went up and
down tins line and heard their tale of woe. There were
m habitations, and the new comers had to dig little holes
in the earth to live in. . . In 1886 we took out, to our
n-reat astonishment, 70 more emigrants. They were
landed on the beach, without any habitation or provision
for their subsistence having been made. They also had
heen promised 240 a. of land each, but they might as
readilv have been promised 1000, for the whole desert was
not worth a sixpence. . . An agent of the company
promoting the local railway made an expedition into the
interior to see if better land could not be dis-
covered. After being away 14 days he reported
nothing but a desert—no vegetation and no drink-
ing water and returned in great distress. . . .
The first Welsh party thought they were going to make
their own laws, and teach theirchildren theirown language
in their own schools. They were, however, soon dis-
abused of that idea by the appearance in the locality of
an official from the Argentine Government, who gave
them to understand that they would have to be sub-
servient to the Government, have their children trained
up in Spanish schools, and generally adopt Anglo-Spanish
customs. It is worse than the worst features of Australian
soil. The country is as Hat as the sea ; there is no railway
south of Bahia Blanca, which is fully 150 miles north of
the proposed “New Australian’’ settlement, and postal
communication is only carried on by means of steamers
at irregular periods. An attempt was made to establish
postal communication by horse with Bahia Blanca, but
neither horse nor rider were heard of again after they
started. The authorities, too, are of the most degraded
Spanisli or Gauoha type. As far as I know, when you
have passed Bahia Blanca southwards you have passed
the line of arable land and of civilisation. From Buenos
Ayres westward the soil is better, but not to be oomparea
with Australian land. There are no trees to speak of,
thornbush being the predominant feature of vegetation.
Evidently there is a deep-laid conspiracy against
“New Australia.” The South Americans
themselves are in the movement—they have
conspired together to leave this region un-
occupied for more than 300 years, and to regard
it as being of no use to anybody ; and the
Indians seem to have been in the conspiracy
even before the Spanish invasion.

The “ Supplementary Report of the New South
Wales Civil Service Board for 1891,” a docu-
ment which has been kept so dark that very
few are even aware of its existence, has just
reached this office. As a full and complete
explanation of the causes which have led to the
insolvency of the Civil Service Superannuation
Fund, the “Report”.is valuable. According
to the figures furnished by two eminent actuaries,
the shortage, as far back as 1890, was £99,000 ;
hi other words, there is no longer any Fund
only a steadily-increasing void and a minus
quantity. The" Fund, in 1887, when the Jen-
nings-Dibbs Cabinet retired from office, was
solvent, with a balance of nearly £20,000 over
all liabilities, therefore three years of Parkes’
administration dissipated not only all the
current receipts, amounting to £330,000, but
created a deficiency of £llB,OOO. Parkes’
economy consisted simply in discharging super-
fluous civil servants and pensioning them out
of the Superannuation Fund, thereby shifting
the burden from the public revenue to the
private savings of the service. The act was one
of absolute confiscation, the money which the
civil servants had been forced to contribute as
a provision for their old age being seized
upon to create a bogus surplus in the
public accounts. Under the Parkes regime
no less than 89 individuals, all under the
statutory age for retirement, were saddled
on the fund, which was thus burdened
with an improper liability of £173,500.
Eighteen of .these pensioners were under 40,
and the great majority were under 50 years of
age. Even in the last year of its existence the
Parkes Government pursued its devastating
path of thrift by discharging any officials who
could be spared, compensating them with
pensions out of the Superannuation Fund, and
borrowing money from any available source to
pay the pensions. The principle was exactly
the same as that on which Parkes ran his
other insurance-company some years ago, and
tlie same identical smash followed in each case.
The one advantage of the existing system of
Government by Contradiction is that this kind
of fraudulent "finance is always exposed—when
it is too late—-by the other side on its accession
to office. Party Government never, or hardly
ever, gets there in time to prevent any swindle,
however glaring, but for showing it up when
the evil is past remedy it has no equal.

The Commonwealth Bill of the Imperial Federa-
tion Convention is becoming too expensive a
toy for even resourceful New South Wales to
play with much longer. It was an indirect
factor in the downfall of the Parkes Admini-
stration ; and now it promises to be the means of
upsetting the Dibbs Cabinet. During Parkes’
Premiership the question of Australian Federa-
tion was discussed on fourteen nights in the
Legislative Assembly ; and since Dibbs formed
his Government it has been debated on seven
nights. If, as Dibbs avers, it costs £350 a night
to run what he elegantly termed “the parlia-
mentary show,” those debates have«cost the
province £7350; but, apart from these occasions,
the general question has been debated at great
length, from time to time, on addresses-in-
reply, and motions of censure, and motions of
adjournment; and the probability is that it
cost fully £2650 to “run the Parliamentary
show ” while these irregular debates were pro-
ceeding. To this total of £lO,OOO, however,
there must be added the price of Parkes’ Con-
vention, which stands at £5806 in the books of
the Treasury. An expenditure of £15,806 in
the cause of Imperial Federation ! Yet it is
solemnly proposed to suspend all legislative
business—for an indefinite period ! —in order to
consider the Common-link Bill clause by clause.
If it needed six nights to criticise the
principles of the measure how many nights
are likely to be consumed in scrutinising the
various machinations of the emissaries of the
Imperial Federation League ? Six resolute
men, versed in parliamentary procedure, could
protract the committee proceedings to three
months. When is this farce to end, and what
is it to cost ? Cannot the Labour members dis-
cern the motives of the Imperial Federationists?
Let the Common-link Bill be revised radically
hut rapidly ; and then, when the appeal is made
to the constituencies, the Representatives of
Labour can effectually saddle the real sinners
with the responsibility of this criminal waste of
time and treasure.
Diplomacy.
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
“You are quite wrong. I was not rude to her,
but simply, as I thought, diplomatic. A girl with
six thousand a year in her own right, with the
record of a hundred offers made her, needs
approaching in some other than conventional
ways. I must admit I made a mistake this time,
but my judgment, when women were concerned,
was never at fault before.”
“ But what did you do to come such an awful
cropper?—what line did you take?”
“Do ! I simply took her for a long walk and
attempted to educate her into my pet theory that
there is but one man who needs more praying for
than he with great sensual tendencies, viz : he
with none. I backed m, elf up with peeps
into the private lives of all the great of
the earth, from David downward —by the
aid of a little ingenuity I taught her
to understand the absolutely lost condition of the
ninety and nine “who needed no repentance,”
until at last, stopping beneath the shadow of a
great oak, she looked up in some bewilderment
and asked, ‘ Who, then, shall be saved ?’ ”
Then came my chance,
“The vaccinated,” I exclaimed, placing my
hand upon my breast; “ they who have come up
out of much tribulation, spies who have invaded
the Devil’s territory and stolen grapes,” and when
I had, as I thought, converted her from the hollow
conventional into my own way of thinking I sank
my voice down to the strictly confidential and
told her that I, too, in common with David and
the rest, had
“Ate, drank, lived, laughed, loved and liked life well.”
And would she, knowing this, pardon my veracity
and take me for what I was? You see, don’t you,
the wisdom of my plan of campaign ?
“ Not quite.”
“ But surely you know, my dear fellow, that
every woman is at heart a rake and her Mte noir
the milk-sop of sister-worship.”
“ Well, how did you succeed ? ”
She stood very thoughtfully for a second or two,
and then, to my intense astonishment, said : “ I
have not the slightest objection to your wide
knowledge of things carnal ; the last man that I
would think of marrying would be a hero of the
‘ kiss-mammy ’ school who, in that he had not
tasted of the tree of knowledge, could have no
feelings in common with a legitimate daughter of
Eve.” And then again she added after a pause :
“Think how much we shall have to tell each
other when we are married, of past loves, of
crusades against conventionality, of risky midnight
episodes. Life can never be dull for us,can it ?” I
need scarcely say that this speech frightened me
greatly—six thousand a year was not to be thrown
away lightly; but it must be accompanied by
innocence and purity. I was about to add that
my theory went a step farther than I had told
her, and involved the union of knowledge with
sweet innocence, the coming together of white-
robed chastity and a practical acquaintance with
the world’s ways. When, reading my thoughts,
she stopped me by raising her hand and continued
—“I started life with much such theories as
yours. I did not see much worth living for in the
constricted life that society has prescribed for the
ordinary woman. My fortune made the acquisition
of knowledge an easy matter, and so at 18 I went
to school again. I travelled into other countries
under another name, and explored a little into the
dark continent of men’s midnights, the —to women
—great and mysterious unknown.
“And learnt?” I asked with what breath this
startling revelation had left me. She shut up
like an orchid-leaf and said with a laugh, “Some
day I will tell you.”
“ This was sauce for the goose with a vengeance.”
“ Yes, apple-sauce, this ‘legitimate daughter of
Eve ’ would say, probably ; what did I do next ?
Why, I took my ten seconds and then asked if I
might meet her in the afternoon beneath the same
tree. We met, and I—well, to put it very briefly
—I backed out of it. She remonstrated, prated of
injustice done her, confidences violated, and all
that, but I was firm, and told her that my keen
sense of right and wrong, my admiration for a high
standard of morality— in women— 'dictated the
course I was taking. So we parted—she in tears,
and I with a gratifying sense of having done a
noble thing in sacrificing six thousand a year in
so good a cause. It was then I went to the
country, and caught in her father’s dairy my wild
gazelle' that I am now taming and educating.”
“ By-the-by, how is she getting on ?” _
“ Not well. She has been at school six months
and still eats peas with her knife, and drops all
her h’s anyhow, she is virtuous. But let us get
back to the other—to the wise Caroline. Have
you heard anything of her lately ?”
“ Yes, I left her an hour since; my main object
in coming was to tell you that we are to be
married to-morrow.”
“Married! Married!! My poor fellow, had
you no knowledge until now of her past ?”
“Knowledge ! She has been a parishioner of my
father’s since she was seven, she is the founder of
his Mechanics’ Institute and the Girls’ Friendly
Society, and insists upon remaining president of
them after the wedding.”
“ But—and now, do be candid with me, I
promise you I will not be angry—tell me wherein I
made the mistake; has she or has not
a prude’s objection to a man of the world?”
‘ < Indeed, no, but she has a lady’shorror of making
it a topic of conversation. She thinks, as I do,
that it is extremely improbable that when David
and Jonathan went for a stroll they discussed
Abigail and her charms. When you have per-
fected the education of your wild gazelle you
will teach her, won’t you, to hide as much as
possible of her past ? Miss Hardy is pleased to
believe that she loves me, but she has no love for
the manure about my roots, and if she is as wise
as I think her she will not burrow for it.”

Dear Bulletin, —The best monument that
can be established to the memory of George
Higinbotham the Great, the most enduring, the
most eloquent of his greatness, and the most
valuable to the community would be, in my
individual opinion, a compilation of his political
and other utterances. As a text-book for young,
and even purblind Democracy, it would be full of
the purest and noblest inspiration. I selfishly
hope that the proposed memorial will, in part at
least, partake of such live and life-giving form.
—Yours fraternally, Paul Mell.
In Memoriam.
George Higinbotham. Died, Dec. 31, 1802.
IL ro of mark among heroes, type of the God-soul
that mado you,
Ever the champion steadfast, rich in humanity s
Soon—ah, too soon for humanity ! -Death midst
the Shadows has laid you
Powerless and prone and effectless, lost m
material dust; . . ,
Lost to the millions that languish and wntne
’neath the burdens of ages —
Ages long wrapt in the hell-nurtured darkness
that heralds the light, ,
Lost to that band of devoted whose record life s
unwritten pages
Shall blazon for aye as the soldiers who con-
quered and fell in the fight.
Lost to the murmuring peoples, still voicing, with
pathos uncertain, ,
Anthems whose keynote, majestic and g.onous,
tenderly true,
Shall swell ’neath the word of the Master, rending
in twain the dusk curtain
At last, with a storm-blast resistless, life s heart-
core shall thrill through and through,
And, gathering ever in volume, shall sweep mm,
silence eternal, . . ,
Error’s false harmonies, questioning man s
jarring note of despair ;
And the ban-dogs of avarice, lust-born, shall for
aye cease their discord infernal,
And, bristling o’er with shamed terror, sneak
mutely to die in their lair.
Lost to us, aye, thou’rt dead in our dim-lit
horizon of Now,
But see, in the east, rises yonder, the thrice-
blessed herald of day!
Thou still art our pilot and counsellor, still with
the wreath on thy brow,
Girded for toil, thou art loader ! Press forward
and show us the way !
Tetnora, Jan. 11, 1893.

Mr. Twynam, the N.S. W. Chief Surveyor,
has taken six months’ leave, prior to retirement.
The vacant post will be filled by J. R. All worth,
the Maitland District Surveyor.
In condemning Judge Williams’ verdant
protest against the appointment of Dr. Madden
as legal chieftain of Victoria it is generally for-
gotten that Williams was about to be commissioned
to the acting-Governorship when the new man
intervened. Just as Williams was to supersede
the Radical Higinbotham, because he seemed less
“dangerous,” Tory Madden now supersedes Wil-
liams, the Democratic native. That accommoda-
ting “dormant commission” which could remain
dormant during Higinbotham’s lifetime, wakes
up again suddenly at the approach of Chief
Justice Madden.
“ I believe that the Melbourne merchant 3
would gladly purchase a continuance of their im
porting monopoly by the surrender of our civi
government. I believe the pastoral class would
gladly, on the same terms, effect the defeat of the
agricultural interest. . . . And I say that, as
with the merchants and squatters, so with the
officials. There is not in this country at the
present minute a dissatisfied official who would
not procure the redress of his grievances, whether
real or imaginary, by the sacrifice of all public
rights, and by the destruction, personal and
political, of every public reputation.”—Higin-
botham.
The acceptance by Minister Lyne, N.S.W.,
of a local tender for iron pipes at an excess in cost
over importers' tenders of at least .£lO,OOO is not
only not an instalment of Protection but is flatly
against Protectionist principles. The excess is
practically a bonus, and a State bonus granted
after insufficient publicity and under conditions
which limit local competition is the most vicious
form of bolstering up a native industry conceivable,
inasmuch as the incidence is partial and the gain
is ephemeral. At the same time it doesn’t lie in
the mouths of the Freetraders to oppose the
acceptance of the pipe-tender. There is scarcely
a writer advocating Freetrade who does not
justify the principle of the bonus —in particular,
B. R. Wise, in his latest book, does this so aptly
to the circumstances in which Lyne finds himself,
that it is a wonder the latter did not quote Wise
in defence of his action.
The latest explanation of Premier Shiels
is that “ he has not resigned.”
Roger North, Government Agent of the
Queensland “ blackbirder ” Foam, suicided the
other day at Maryborough. What interesting
reading there would be in a return of all the
Government Agents who have suicided, been
chopped down by niggers, broken their necks
falling down stairs, dropped over balconies while
getting away from devils, blue alligators, and
mock-turtle, gone overboard at sea, and died other
violent deaths since the blood-soaked Queensland
slave-trade first began ! In the old times there
used to be a great sameness about the death of the
Government Agent. He came home from a cruise
and straightway went on a horrid and continuous
rum-drunk along with the captain and the mate.
He told ghastly stories about murders and orgies
in the South Seas, and had more rum after each
story. He smoked like a furnace and used to yell
in his sleep, and keep the whole hotel awake all
night. Then he became maudlin, lachrymose,
and wretched, and thought himself pursued by
ghostly Kanakas, and, after sprinting around the
hotel with nothing on, he generally cut his throat
and hovehimself through awindow. His belongings,
when overhauled, usually consisted of some
clothes, pawn-tickets, a lot of firearms, a portrait
of a riotous-looking barmaid and another of a
Kanaka woman without any clothes on, and a
dog’s-eared letter from “ Home,” declining to for-
ward another remittance. He was planted in the
most forlorn corner of the cemetery, he never had
any tombstone, and his name is so completely for-
gotten that he might never have had any name at
all.
You have heard of George Washington Shiels,
Who never says what isn’t true,
But wriggles the same as the eels
Were slippily fashioned to do.
His statements are swaddled in doubt,
Their meanings we struggle to find ;
This much we can clearly make out—
At present he hasn’t resigned.
When holding first place in the House
And “ leading” the Government on,
A baby without any nous
Could tell that his Nibs hadn’t gone.
As long as he stays in the fore,
With bis followers huddled behind,
You can bet all your money, and more,
That a Premier hasn't resigned.
Perhaps he has taken the “ knock ”
In spirit, but not in the flesh,
And soon will surrender his flock
In favour of somebody fresh.
But the beautiful truth is the thing
That governs official mankind,
And Shiels can piously cling
To the fact that he hasn't resigned.
CORRESPONDENCE
No notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must in every case appear on MS.
“John L.” (Sydney): You remind us of the
infidel who said “Thank God, I’m an Atheist.” Think
over this and you’ll see the point “0. C. Mac ” : Sub-

pointless Scotch reminiscence “ F ; F.” (Townsville):
Sorry, but we can’t spare space for the infant phenomenon
of the Far North.... “ E.T.L.” (Townsville): The world is
tired of tin stereotyped Christmas cant about peace and
goodwill. But then nobody believes it, not even the
preacher. It is only the weary yell of a tired snuftier
who wants to get home to his stuffed turkey and plum-
duff .. “ Anglo-Australian ” (Queensland): Wehaveshut

about his grave may be sent to The Bulletin. ... “ Alpha ”

able and bony subject....“ J. Jones” (Goulburn): Good
story if true. Also good if not true.... “ A Crow'-eater ” :
Have read seven times, and finally conclude that the lost
swaarnan was uncle to the man with the wooden leg, and
that the man who drank his cheque at the pub. ate the
horse that was stolen by the brother of the one-eyed man
from the father-in-law' of the individual who was never
again heard of. Try to sort the tale out next time... .
“Geo. L.S.” (Port Pirie): Your ignorance of banking is
something stupendous. You are almost ignorant enough
to be an auditor “ Waratah ” : The first verse is
“ immense ” :
“ Australia mine, you have charms for me,
Though lands afar are green ;
And your foes will swing on a ring-barked tree
Ere I’ll go to the Argentine.”
“ E.D.” (Wellington): We have received eleven con-
tradictory reports about the M.L. senator who lost his
teeth overboard, and have shifted the owner of the teeth
six times. We decline to shift him any more. The tooth-
story must stand,... “W.A.S.” (Maitland): Hardly suit-
able “ Boa ” (N. Sydney): How did the man shoot him-
self through the head and then wrap up the pistol in brown
paper and address it to the girl? Very improbable,
though we did once meet, at a Sydney surgeon’s
door, a man who, after shooting himself right
through the brain, had walked a mi1e.....“ Satan ”
(Gehenna, we presume); Thanks “Eleve”: Good
sentiment, but commonplace verse. The “ heart-
rending moan” is used up.... “Thomas L.” (Ultimo);
Excellent... “Sox”: We don’t care for the flogging of
the “martial drum ” and the waving of the “ battle-flag,”
A land-bank that would wave an honest balance-sheet
would do a lot more g00d.... “ White Hart ” : No good,
even apart from the crushing fact that the hero “ strode ”
into the hotel... “X.Y.P.”: We notice that it is always
the harmless little man with the shrill voice who sends in
the lurid battle-poem, while the big, murderous-looking
man invariably writes about the spring flowers and the
dew. Judging by the awful carnage in your screed you
should be a person 4ft. high with a perambulator ..
“The Exile”: A very dull lament. Exiles are dreary
persons “Libby” : We receive 40 pomes a week on an
average telling Labour to “Arise! ” and not one telling it
definitely what it ought to do when.it has “ arisen ”...
“ D.C.” (Kiama): Willing indistinct. Locks like a state-
ment that you have 82 diseases, drink 12 quarts of tea a
day, and are working with a confirmed wife-beater
“ J.G.O’S.” (B.): The Bulletin really doesn’t care
whether you are made a magistrate or not
“Singleton”: Many thanks....” A Labourer” (Port
Augusta): Received “Arakoom”: What is “an
anachronistic oleograph of the didactic school,” anyhow?
Is it only put in because it sounds we 11?....“ A Native
Bear”: Well-written, though an old, old, very' old and
time-battered subject.... “ Observer ” : Figures of speech
too wild. An “argosy ” launched from “a womb,” and
“ treasures of the brain going forth on their journey,”
and “a utopia launched on the stream,” are too awful....
“ J.C.M'C.” (Melb.): Unsuitable. Still, there is poetry
in the picture of “ the sun setting behind the lime-kiln of
Madame Melba’s papa, while the she-bard on the hill
composed her “Rebuke to a Bull-Ant’” “Owen
Tudor” (Sydney): It isn’t a poem, but a square mile of
sing-song. If we were you, we’d throw the screed
open for selection “ Prof. R.S.” (of Cooma); \our
“local song” is inane dish-water, set to the tune of the
cat on the back-wall. Also, when you write puffs for
your fortune-telling biz., you should at least learn ta
spell the glaring mendacity better than this:
My charge it is but here 2 bob,
To tell your tale right througliou,
For like Professor girls.
This world can boast but few.
1 here defy the uper 10
To beat me for the right.
Come wen you may, my jollie palls,
You will not find me lite.
“J.U.O.” (Ooolamon): We know nothing of her,
except that no one has complained before. Write her
again “8.G.” (Ball.); Very welcome “ Will R.” :
Wc always suspect verses “ written by a friend of ” the
person who sends them. We want some tangible entity
to bombard in case of plagiarism —“ H. C. Shaw”:
Letter awaiting you... “ Corfitz Cronquist”: Letter
from Sweden and three otlu rs lying at Bulletin office. ..
“ T.S.” : Well meant, but it. isn’t poetry. He had an ear
for rhythm, and to print such poetry about him would
raise him from the grave..., “W. E. Carew” : Good veige.
“D.A.A.” (Melb.): Not yet to hand “Lictor”:
Many thanks “Eko”: Before a man starts to write
about Kanakas as a paid commissioner of the Argus he
must necessarily know what the Arous wants to hear.
Such papers don’t exist for the purpose of changing their
spots or blasting any description of disguised slavery that
pays dividends... “B. L’E.”: “ Marion L,” accepted....
“M.W.S.” (Kill., Q.): Hop, wants to know what it is all
about? .. “Lolo”: Hawley Smart was better than
Surtees, of “Sponge’s Sporting Tour,” and the like, but
much inferior to Whyte-Melville, indeed not in the same
flight at a 11.... “ T.G.S,” (Camden): We don’t know any-
thing about telegram re caricature.... “ Miner ” (Perth):
Thanks “R.R.” (Q.): Write again.C.W.M.” :
Thanks, but we don’t want poems “based on other
pieces.” “D. Emdee ” : We have read the Argus
Kanaka-trade articles. As, however, the Argus was
absolutely committed in advance to support the South
Sea nigger-trade, we simply let the articles go for what
they’re worth.
The Victorian Board of Lands and Works
has declared that, for the future, only sawn
sleepers will be used on the railways. The reason
given for this—that sleeper-cutters waste forest
timber—is abject in its futility and a standing
reflection on the imagination of the particular
“ authority ” commissioned to supply the excuse.
Broadaxe-men can get just as many sleepers out
of a log as the saw-miller, and the hewn sleepers
are far superior to the sawn timber. By the way,
isn’t there one high Victorian railway-functionary
a saw-mill proprietor?
The Argus, which paper reveres the name
of Disraeli, reprints a sketch from the Speaker,
showing that the man with the green velvet waist-
coat and the greasy kiss-curls owed a very great
deal to one Neilson, a Times reporter, who
reported him when he was a despised nobody, and
helped to push him on all occasions. The pith of
the story is in its proof that Disraeli had “ grati-
tude ”as big as a football. He never forgot the
friend of his obscure days, and when he became
Prime Minister “recommended Neilson to the
Queen for a civil list pension !” It is always
pleasant to hear of these noble traits in our great
men.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Royal, “Falka.”
Her Majesty’s “ Blue Beard.”
Lyceum “ Little Red Riding Hood.”
Opera House Harry Rickards.
York Street Rink Wirth’s Colossal Circus.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's “The Forty Thieves.”
Royal “ Babes in the Wood.”
Fillis’ Circus and Menagerie.
“Falka,” at Sydney Royal, improves on
a longer and closer acquaintance, and the materials
out of which it is constructed somehow don’t look
quite so skimpy as they did. The acting, which is
good all round, the scenery, and the music, are
sufficient to cover a multitude of sins, and certain
improvements are visible this week which make
■the piece go with more vim than it did. Falka is
a better shot with a fruit for one thing, and can
hit Tanered now with three apples out of four.
This makes us feel better, particularly as Tanered
seems to be hurt by the vegetable, though justice
will never be fully satisfied until that clown is
struck with a ship’s anchor, largest size. The
drinky monk is even more hilariously drunk
than he was at first. A good piece of Tancred’s
■opening speech—the one he makes before he falls
into the cellar —has been cut out, to the satisfaction
of everybody concerned ; and the only objection-
able feature which can’t be remedied is Mr. Edward
Allen in a girl’s frock which is several degrees too
short for him, and a whalebone corset, and a pair
of pale-blue stockings. The public has got ac-
customed to the girl-boy, and is ready to rise with
enthusiasm when she comes along, but the boy-
girl is and always will be a failure, and the she-
man of all sorts —the Widow O’Brien included—
is an unwholesome spectacle. In “Falka,” the
he-maiden is such an essential feature of the story,
that it can’t be eradicated without abolishing, the
entire opera, and perhaps it is on that account
that this otherwise pretty show has never yet
made any decided boom. The question as to
whether Miss Clara Merivale or Miss Josephine
Deakin is the greater attraction has been agitating
the present writer all the past fortnight, and is
hereby left unsettled for an indefinite period.
There is so very much to be said for both these
charmers that The Bulletin despairingly sug-
gests they should toss for it.
** * *
Sydney Garrick, which closed up last week
under certain depressing circumstances already
fully described, remains closed under the same
circumstances, and patiently awaits the advent of
the doughty Tommy Hudson on the 28th.
The two pantomimes are still competing
against each other with varied success, and
a special effort is being made to boom “Blue-,
beard” at Her ’Majesty’s by distributing
toys among the audience. Whether this means
that the potentate with the azure wool can’t
stand entirely on his own merits, or that the
management is making a stupendous effort to
crush its loathsome contemporary, the other pan-
tomime, the advertisement sayeth not. The Shakes-
pearian comedy at the Criterion has finished its
fourth week, and there is, so far, no sign of any
falling off in the public enthusiasm. The public,
like the bunyip, is an unaccountable animal.
Three months ago Shakespeare seemed to be the
very last thing that was wanted in Sydney, and
now it would appear that the community is
screaming for Shakespeare and for nothing else.
Harry Rickards’ unmelodious coster song "still
rends the air at the Opera House with a fair
measure of success, and the “ad.” asserts that the
“Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay Lament” was “re-de-
manded seven times.” Which fact, considering
that the audience has had the same “ Lament ”
about three times every night for a month past, is
calculated to make a philosopher sit up and think
audibly.
* * *- *
About twice a week on a steady average
there arrives at this office a letter from some well-
meaning correspondent, generally a person con-
nected with a theatre, pointing out that The
Bulletin, or some other paper, has made mention
of Miss Jones, or some equally obscure person
who was billed in some obscure part at a local
show, whereas Miss Jones failed to turn up at ;
the last moment and her place was filled by Miss
Smith. Then the correspondent goes on to
explain that two years ago an equally glaring
mistake was made when Mr. Higgins, at the
last moment, took Mr. Briggs’ part as the
fourth rioter, or something of the kind, and the
Bulletin, going by the programme, altogether
overlooked the change. We hereby announce
that we are tired of this sort of information.
The Bulletin doesn't know which is Miss Jones
or Miss Smith, it never expects to know, and it
really doesn’t want to. If th*e eighth girl in tights
is billed as Jones it cheerfully accepts her as such,
and if the management puts on a new girl every
night for 14 consecutive nights, and keeps the
old name standing in the bill all the while, it will
accept them all as Miss Jones and never notice the
difference. It will do the same for 28 nights if
necessary. The very small mummer—the one who
helps to form a tumult in a historical play, or acts
as a guard of honour—is apparently convinced
that every newspaper-man should know his or her
grease-painted lineaments by heart, but, as it
happens, the toil-worn pressman doesn’t know
anything of the kind, any more than the
weary public does, and doesn’t attempt to.
As a rule, he can recognise the leading actors and
actresses, and he takes the rest for granted. If
one of the small fry calls himself Julius Ciesar on
the bill, while the part he is alleged to fill is
really occupied by Pompey, the pair can fight it
out. Any further-letters on this well-worn subject
will be thrown out of the back window.
Mr. W. E. Humphreys has called round to
point out that it is he and not Captain
Russell, as stated in these columns last week,
who is so lucky as to be the husband
of Mdlle. Jasia Scherazade. Mr. Humphreys
is the gentleman who throws a tiger about in
Fillis’ arena, and whips it over fences, and has
boxing-matches with it, until the big cat gives it
up and goes home bounced and beaten. Also, Mr.
Humphreys was for years animal-trainer at
Sanger’s and Wombwell’s and other circuses in
Europe, and what he doesn’t know about the
handling of lions, tigers, panthers, elephants,
rhinoceroses and other wild beasts is not worth
knowing. In those circumstances, and moved by
the eternal instincts of justice, The Bulletin
hereby withdraws the statement that Captain
Russell is the husband of Mdlle. Scherazade.

The Victorian Australian Natives’ Asso-
ciation is making extensive preparations for
its Foundation Day demonstration on Jan, 26.
A big programme of athletic sports has been
arranged, various side and music shows will be on
hand, and Archibald Meston’s Queensland blacks
are to perform various blood and lung ceremonies,
and initiate the city-bred Australian into the
mysteries of boomerang and nulla warfare. All
the available amateur artistic and literary genius
is to compete for prizes, and the successful entries
will be published and exhibited on the day of the
fete. Besides this, the admission-ticket includes a
chance in the art union, the first prize of which is
an optional twelvemonths’ trip round the world,
or a villa value i£6oo, to be selected by the winner.
The art-union prizes total <£1250.

The Melbourne pantomimes plod their
weary ways with an unmistakeable air of fatigue.
There is no ginger in either entertainment, and
numerous audiences nightly express their dissatis-
faction in a negative manner. “ Forty Thieves,”
at the Princess’, was expected to improve as time
went on—up to the present, it has only changed
slightly for the worse. The donkey is a green
patch in the desert, and Snazelle’s singing goes
for something, but the pantomime, for the most
part, isn’t a pantomime, or a burlesque, or any-
thing, save the spectacle of Lonnen industriously
striving.to be comic in the midst of gaudy sorrow.
Therefore, “ The Forty Thieves ” has come to be
regarded as an expensive delusion, and a revised
edition, advertised for Saturday night, is very
urgently called for. New songs, dances, and
extras are promised on a liberal scale, and if the
result should be tantamount to a new show
entirely, all may yet go well.
** * *
“ Babes in the Wood” now professes to
have special charms for the young, but in this
selfish world the “old man,” who pays the piper,
is the individual you need to nobble. Moreover,
the merry laugh of innocent childhood isn’t
especially noticeable at the Royal, anyway. Pos-
sibly the youngsters took fright at the news that
George Coppin’s panto, is intended to educate
them in Hinglish history, for the infant with a
yearning to be educated doesn’t exist. An
announcement that the last matinee of “ The
Babes ” will occur on Saturday seems like a flag
of distress, and the prospect of Melbourne pre-
sently coming down again to one theatre is faced
with fortitude. A suggestion that the poor old
Opera House has shut up is embodied in the pre-
ceding paragraph.
** * *
Fillis’ Circus and Menagerie make an
opportune start next Saturday (21st) upon a con-
venient pitch. The site chosen for this large
enterprise is adjacent to the business end of
Princes’ Bridge, so in the event of the lions
breaking loose they will naturally prowl into the
Anglican Cathedral and go for the Christians as
of old. The glories of Fillis’ Circus have been
told in The Bulletin, and a boom is almost
certain to ensue. Melbourne is in just that
gloomy frame of mind for which reckless horse-
riding and the roar of wild beasts are necessary
tonics. A taste for performing tiger has been
whetted by coloured posters, and an earnest hope
that the five elephants will pull down a pantomine
with their trunks is generally expressed.

Geo. W ood, late of the Alabama Minstrels,
has hurled in his lot with the Cogills, at St.
George’s II ill, whilst the Gaiety puts forth a
champion clog dance and other exciting novelties.
Also, the' weather is largely in favour of Saturday
concerts at the Exhibition, win rj Miss Banks,
Ida’ Osborne, Gladstone Wright, Stockwell, James
Wood, and other cultured songsters hold the floor.
The soprano and tenor vocalists mostly warble of
love, m contra-distinction to the contralto and

At Poverty Point.
At Melbourne Princess’, after the entry of the nations,
the audience is requested to join in the “National

Bernard Beere s lour in America has come to an
u,ltunel y el)d - S!le was the deadest of dead frosts, and
t |, is> too> after such preliminary puffing as feiractresses
ever had. All kinds of excuses are made for her fiasco,
but the real explanation is that she is worn out—for the
present, anyhow,
To judge by the tone of the press-notices, remarks The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, people at a distance
would think that, by the death of Fred Leslie, England
had sustained a national loss. Mummer-worship is as rife
as ever. George Edwards is in despair, as he mav well
be, for how is Leslie’s place to be filled? Arthur Roberts
is all very well in his vulgar way, and Lonnen may amuse
some people by his laboured extravagances, but for
spontaneous merriment and true rattling burlesque Fred
B es ’* e has left no successor.
We will forgive the Americans finding fault with Johnny
Sharidans Australian perfornur’, because they stick up

Melbourne and Adelaide Cycloramas are now en-
gaged in changing their pictures. “Jerusalem at,the
Time of the Crucifixion ” goes to Melbourne, and
“Waterloo ”to Adelaide. It remains to be seen whether
Jeremiah Brown, the “ Waterloo veteran,” will be carried
to Saintopolis, or whether he will hereafter he exhibited
as a survivor of the siege of Titus.
Albert Chevalier is said to have signed engagements
which extend over several years, by which he will scoop
in something like £40,000 ! Lucky “ Chivvy I” It is a
question, however, whether the music-hall rage will last
so long, and then it will be seen how far these long-ahead
engagements will hold good, for people say they are all
one way, and that a Cobb’s coach can be driven through
any of them when the necessity arises.
Tommy Hudson, the minstrel man, has just finished a
most satisfactory seven weeks’ season at Brisbane Theatre
Royal. On the night of his benefit the thermometer stood
at 98, in a packed house,
“ Fritz ” was acted by Williamson, in Melbourne, befor®
Emmet came.
The blue pencil, Leslie complained, was run by the
Gaiety manager too much through his burlesque composi-
tions, in London. So he produced “ Cinder Ellen” in
Australia, and we had all the wit.
The portrait of Miss Hilda Spong, recently published
by The Bulletin, was taken from an artistic photo, by
Falk, of 406 George-street, Sydney. Through an over-
sight our indebtedness to that firm was not acknowledged.
The “Waterloo” Oyclorama fairly competed with the
pantomimes on its last day in Melbourne. A thousand
people paid to take a last look at the fine, breezy picture
which has been a continuous draw for 44 months.
“ Waterloo” spoilt Melbourne for “The Siege of Paris,”
where there was no chance for the distance-effects that
gave the battlefield its chief charm for the multitude.
People can’t be convinced that “The Siege ” is as big a
can vas as the other.
The comely Julia Wormlie will marry the coloured basso
MoAdoo.
What shall be done unto him whom the Queen delighteth
to honour? Filthy lucre cannot pass between a queen
and a knight, so Her Majesty thanked Augustus Harris
for producing “ Carmen ” at Windsor, gave him a breast-
pin, and graciously allowed him to write his name in her
birthday book !
G. T. Minshull, an exact imitator of Fred. Leslie’s style,
was taking the latter’s part in “Cinder-Ellen Up Too Late ”
when the last mail left London.
Choice extract from “ Mr. Shrewsbury at Home ”
operetta, at Melbourne Exhibition concerts. Shrewsbury
(Edwin Kelly), on hearing a bassoon outside the window,
exclaims, “ Someone’s sick in the garden." But Lance
Lenton declares that such a line was no part of his trans-
lation.
Nothirg could be more mysterious than Bellew’s Mel-
bourne m-rriage, and it resembled Montgomery’s, in all
but the after-effects.
“ By gar, vat do de peoples vant?”—Simonben.
Mary Anderson wanted Fred Leslie to act Romeo
through the American tour.
Chas. Warn ;r, Cartwright, and other actors, figured as
supers in the recent performance of “Carmen,” Windsor
Castle, before Queen Victoria. Carrington was Lord High
Chief Bustler, or Chamberlain, on the occasion.
Plain Bill Holloway modestly says that Henry Irving is
nearly as strict as Harwood or himself.
Slab of plot from George Leitch’s new drama, “A
Prodigal Son,” lately booming at Bendigo (Vic.): Two
brothers, one legitimate and the other not, have a fight
on the sea-shore over a girl. The bad man of the play,
who also wants the girl, steps silently out of the adja-
cent bushes and welts the legitimate relative on the head
in the midst of the scrimmage, and then steps back again
as noiselessly as he came. The other combatant, thinking
his brother is dead, and that he did the orful deed, gives
himself up and is tried. The principal witness
against him declines to give evidence on the ground that
she is the prisoner’s long-lost wife—the prisoner doesn’t
seem to know this fact himself. The Judge, who is the
prisoner’s long-lost father—neither of them seem to know
this fact, either—sentences him to death, and he is taken
away by sea, probably to be hanged. But the ship is
wrecked, and the defendant is cast ashore on the same
spot where the original crime was committed, and while
he is shaking the ocean out of his hair his brother—alive
—comes riding in on top of a wave, and they are
re-united. Blue fire and curtain !
Edmund Tearle is coming to Australia to undergo the
chastening process which has done so many London
actors good.
A San Francisco paper tells a gruesome tale about a
showman named Samuels. He went round with a troupe
of trained apes, and all went well till one night when the
two biggest apes rose in insurrection in the middle of the
pciformance, and bit off the hands of Samuels and his
wife before the audience could interfere.
According to Froude, when the wise rule
the ignorant then society is healthiest. Possibly,
if they’d rule in the interests of the ignorant and
not in their own.
Madden and Purves, 20 years ago, gave
no sign of their eminence. Madden was a
billiard-ball sort of fellow, who seemed to have
nothing incisive about him, while Purves was
condemned to obscurity for his angular and brutal
manner, and want of tact. However, as “ Augur ”
Chapman said, they run in all shapes.
No Labour-member should, in the opinion
of The Bulletin, be on chummy terms with any
Ministry, no matter how composed. All Party
Governments are naturally Conservative and cor-
rupt, and nothing but rabid attack and continual
exposure will keep them straight. The Irishman
who, landing in America, asked if there was a
Government there, and, being told that there was,
answered, “Then, I’m agin it,” was an instinctive
democrat and true to his principles.
The S.M. Herald is afraid that the Mel-
bourne Chinese strikers will introduce revolution-
ary labour practices into their own country. The
godly Herald does not seem to be aware that the
earliest strike recorded seems to have had Divine
sanction. The Jews who objected to make bricks
without straw and who, taking their bosses’
jewels, marched out of Egypt in triumph, struck
so successfully that, as a race, they’ve never re-
turned to manual labour since.
Hector Wilson, the well-known Victorian
squatter, Eugenie Legrand’s second husband (her
first was Kyrle Bellew) is dead. He kept
very quiet for many years, but was knocked out
by the consequences of his hilarious days—the
days wherein, for instance, he and some congenial
spirits tilled with water all the boots that the
boarders at Scott’s Hotel had put out to be cleaned.
And when landlord Wilson remonstrated, the
genial Hector punched him in the eye, for which
the Bench sent Hector up to Melbourne gaol
whence, some days later, he emerged to take his
seat in a drag (drawn by four white horses, and
driven by one of the Penders) amid the sound of
defiant trumpets tootled by his gilded pals.
Hector Wilson was a wild youth, but he had the
). .. . ~f . r ’.lander, and was extremely popular
with his friends.

The Argus told James Service to come
out to form a Cabinet. James replied that on no
account would he take office again. He said so
three years ago and meant it.
St. Patrick’s College, Melb., boasts Dr,
Madden as its crack, and next is Dr. P. Moloney
—who, by the way, has never even aspired to
Parliament. Shiels is from the Scotch College;
and Deakin from Church of England Grammar
School.
The Ardrossan (Scotland) Herald says ;
“ Sir Thomas MTlwraith, now in his 57th year,
is likely again to be Premier in New South Wales
in succession to Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, who
is about to change the office of Premier for that
of Chief Justice of Brisbane.” Let us federate.
Said Lord Newminster to Lord Thurlow,
towards the end of the last century: “My Lord,
I should prefer Bath to London, but that Ido so
miss my morning paper.” Thurlow: “Why,
damme, man, in another hundred years these
morning papers will have undermined all your
privileges.”
According to the latest report, the “ miss-
ing mace” of the Victorian Legislative Assembly
is now at Parliament House, two “ladies” having
brought it back in a “ keb. ”By the way, a close
scanning of the mace debate and an analysis of
the division-list throws strong light on the par-
ticular Ms. P. implicated in this odorous piece of
business.
Dear Bulletin, You recently asked,
Did anyone ever see a deformed Chinaman ? Yes.
I have seen a humpbacked Chow selling vegetables
(and maybe leprosy) in Northern N.S.W. At
West Maitland I met a Chinky with no lower-
jaw, the vacancy being parchrnented over, pickle-
jar fashion, with stuff like the web of a
duck’s-foot. He was one of a strange trio of
physical curiosities. Near by was a negro fruit-
pedlar, with snowy wool, looking like a grass-tree
stump with a scoured thatch-sprout. Nigger said
that oranges were sixpence a dozen : and (I sup.
pose because he couldn’t sell them) he sat on the
kerbstone eating them as if for a wager. Just
then a bullock-team came along. Bullocky was a
handsome-faced, but one-legged and one crutched
white man, who would sling himself from “polers”
to “leaders” in four hops, stop, balance himself
on his crutch, and flog with both hands cleverly
and pluckily. Even the simoom-blast of his pro-
fanity did not upset his equilibrium. The nostrils
of the half-faced Chinaman twittered strangely.
I suppose the man from Leperland was smiling.
I shuddered till the nails dropped out of my boot-
soles. —Yours,
W. M‘MOLESKIN.

Why the mysterious, but potent, political influ-
ence of the Barrier mines ? For many years compulsory
registration within the province has been talked of, and
never a reason publicly urged against it, yet never has
such registration been enforced, and N.S.W, continues to
put up with the loss of revenue. Five years’ experience
has shown that nothing but £1 a ton duty will cause the
mines to use N.S.W.-manufactured coke, but even **»
alleged Protectionist Govt, jibs at its imposition.

The N.S.W. Mines Department should more
clearly define the fees and charges to be made by registrars

Fitz Gibbon told the Melbourne Metropolitan

On enquiring the name of one who was ready to take the.

which Fitz. replied (so he says); “Thank you, I’ve been
to see Walker, London.” Just imagine a solemn old chap

In anticipation of a Mining on Private Property

conservatism so often applied to that English concern.

The writer’s remark about the all-round poison-

dynamite, gelatine, lithofracteur.hellite,sterile,and other
compounds. The writer will admit that some of these

much-advertised article which was carefully tested, by an
old miner in a hot, hard crosscut. “ Did you suffer from
the fumes? ” asked the agent. “ Not at all,” rep’ e 1 the
miner. “Absolutely non-poisonous?” “Yes, but it’s
no explosive,” was the satirical reply.

Nothing in mining succeeds like success. It
booms adjoining blocks, rich or barren. We have received
the Araana prospectus. The properly consists of 33 acres
of the Wentworth goldfield estate of over 1000 acres, and
is floated on these terms—capital, £lOO,OOO -£BO,OOO for
the vendors, £33,333 paid in that number of paid-up
shares, and the balance in cash or shares at the option of
the directors, but which was received the cable sayeth
not. If in shares, then the proprietary company practi-
cally has still the mine. J. J. Cooper, M.E., M.M.,
whose reports on the richness of the estate would he
agreeable reading during the wildest dream of avarice,
foreshadows the value of the Amaim. He says of the
“Brown Vein ” in the Aladdin’s Lamp: “It is not a
vein in which rich gold makes in shoots, hut uniformly
throughout, so it may reasonably bo expected that it will
be met with as rich iii this block as in the Jackass and
Aladdin’s Lamp.” It is remarkable that no report appears
in the prospectus either from Ihe mining manager of the
Wentworth mine or the consulting engineer.

Some confusing paragraphs have appeared
respecting the action taken by some big Adelaide men in
the Shoalhaven sluicing district. The facts are these:
Some six months ago a small number of Sydney men
purchased the water-rights and ground of the Manar
Sluicing Co., which, after spending some £lO,OOO and
declaring a few small dividends by playing at hydriuho
sluicing, went the way of most N.S.W. mining companies
—into liquidation. It was represented in Adelaide that
the ground was payable and by no means worked out,
and that the race might be enlarged and extended to a
well-known claim called the Yellow Springs, or other
places languishing for the want of water. Pleitner,
formerly manager of the Baker’s Creek mine, was engaged
to inspect. Messrs. Handyside and Johnson, ootn
ex-Mimsters of S.A., and well-known practical
mining men, followed. Altogether a fortnight was
spent in prospecting the tremendous drift area, taking
levels, examining proposed tail races, main races and head
waters with the result that they were surprised and
satisfied. A company has been formed, including many
of the Adelaide Barrier men, to carry out the work which,
though it will involve much money, will repay itself in the
first year of sluicing operations. The other two big
sluicing properties on the Shoalhaven River are owned in
Melbourne. They include about 1000 frontage acres to the
drift, which means that they will command ten times that
amount of ground when they begin sluicing thousiyids of
loads away daily, and all the workable land is taken up in
the interests of Melbourne and Adelaide. N.S.W. men, as
usual, will wake up to the potentialities of the field and will
rush madly in with the boom, and lose their money with
their senses.

The lie told about two American miners boring
a hard drill-hole three feet in fifteen minutes has had one
effect. It has started drilling contests on the Barrier,
where the winners bored 27 inches in 15min. But as
there were three of them, we assume that there were two
hammers going, which made all the difference.

A firm of English brokers, in a mining boom,
made a pile of money in the floating of wild-cat mines,
which, they got cheap and passed off at big prices. In one
property, however, a splendid tin lode was found, and
great was the indignation of the members of the firm
that they should unintentionally have sold to the public
what would have paid them to keep.

The Stevenson mix-up, in Melbourne, brings to
mind the time when this Manchester Lane firm was prose-
cuted for Customs evasion, one of the cases in which
Purves won his spurs. It was 15 years ago, and caused a
prime sensation, and the Customs officers, under Guthrie,
carried the warehouse by assault, but nothing came of it,

What has become of the N.S;W. diamond-
mines? After several years working with machinery
there appear to be no satisfactory results. The Melbourne
Co. working at Bingera struck patches of very rich wash
but failed to make operations pay. Thousands of carats
have been found, but not one large stone among them.
The majority of the stones are straw-coloured or brownish
and their average price all through is about ss. per carat,
not 225. as quoted. Picked parcels may have fetched
this. Contrast these mines with those of the Cape. Here
is a limited body of wash to treat of varying thickness
and richness, to reach which in most cases considerable
outlay is requisite for travelling or sinking through the
basalt. The wash-dirt is not so easy to treat as at the
Cape. Here wages are more than double, and the
chances of finding valuable stones small. At the Cape
large diamonds were found right down from the red sand
on the surface, and the depth of diamoi diferous ground
is not yet known, though proved to hundredsof feet.
With the advantages of cheap labour, an indefinite body
of wash-dirt, and the occasional finding of large stones,
many claims could not be made to pay; others only by
putting through 200 tons a day. How many loads a day
can they calculate on putting through regularly from
Australian mines, and, if thousands, with an enormous
yield of small diamonds, what must prices assuredly fall
to? Already the De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mining
Co. have shut down some of their minesso as to limit the
output, and could flood the market any time they saw fit.

Bastion and party, who have been working a
big ironstone blow in the Tarrawingee district and
supplying the British smelters with flux therefrom, have
recently struck in the ironstone some fine specimens of
silver. One or more of the N.S.W. Mines officials, in
reporting on the show many months ago, said practically
that silver would never be found in the formation—an
unsafe remark to make about anything. They have now
been asked to allow the warden or other official to
examine the property, and, if satisfied that the specimens
come from there, to make reasonable reparation to the
owners by contradicting previous reports.
The men who broke into the Golden Gully mine,
N.S.W., are almost worthy of sympathy. Some samples
of heavy pyrites were locked up in a drive used as a
powder-magazine, awaiting the return of the manager.
Then came the rumour that “ another bonanza had been
struck,” and thieves proceeded to steal it. They burst
the door over the shaft and that of the drive, and carried
away what, judging by its weight, they doubtless
imagined was nearly half gold. They are now trying to
kick theniselves for running the risk of ten years’ gaol for
a bag of pyrites, which they' might as well return with
some appropriate expression of their disgust.
# * •
The Peak Hill (Proprietary) mine, recently, came
upon a formation of which little notice was taken. After
driving some 50ft. it was found to contain gold equal to
loz. to the ton. They are now 80ft. into it and not
through. Reports still declare the whole body to be oz.-
rock, and these have been confirmed by directors who
visited the mine last week. In their excitement corres-
pondents speak of its keeping all the batteries of the field
going for many years. Shares have nearly doubled in
value. The writer has been impressed with the perman-
ency of the field indicated by the regularity of big half-oz.
crushings, but would now remind the public that at the
initiation of Peak Hill they were told of several equally
large formations which “assayed” an oz. and “ looked
like Mount Morgan.” They did both, but were very
short-lived. There is hardly a doubt about the present
value of the recent find ; the only question is—will it
last? It it does, in size and value, the shares are worth
as many pounds as they are shillings. Time and work
alone will tell.
# # #
How often do we read in the N.S.W. mining
reports and prospectuses—“ The lode will probably in-
crease in depth !” But has any man ever read —“The
lode will probably become sunller and poorer with
depth?” Never. Yet one is just as reasonable as the
other. Sometimes lodes increase and sometimes they
don’t. There is no golden rule, one way or the other.

“ True Blue crushed last fortnight 100 tons of

Startling, if correct. In the published prospec-
tus of the Amana block of the Wentworth estate (N.S.W.)
it is stated that the manager of the present mine, W. A.
Irwin, reports the brown vein lode formation proved in
the Aladdin’s Lamp to he about 25 feet wide, 6 feet of
which assays 7ozs. to the ton !

No. 1 Baker’s Creek Extended (formerly
“ Baker’s Creek South ’’) is extending one of the levels
of the parent mine, but have already got 100 ft. beyond
the boundary without meeting anything good. It wouia
be strange if in this reef there is only one rich shoot
of gold. The greatest difficulty in the Extended will be
to make sure of keeping in the formation, for the reel at
times disappears altogether, and at others breaks into
sections which bear away in different directions.

declares that “ schemers are busy amongst us {in Mel-

the flat-catching suggestion to convert the ruins of several
companies into a new and sound concern, Simpson scons
at the idea, of issuing “ debentures bearing interest,
with no safer base than land unproductive of income.
44 Debenture ” is a good name to conjure with, however,
ana any flimsy scheme of reconstruction is good enough
to dangle before the eyes of the public as long as certain
gentlemen are before the court.

Bad as times have been during the past year,
the gold-centres of Australia—Charters Towers, Bendigo,
Ballarat, Gym pie, and Croydon—had much bigger yields

old year in all these places took the bloom away from
other quarters.

In California, granite is not regarded as a
favourable country rock, but, as in Australia, many of the
so-called granite formations are syenites and diorites.
Charters Towers and Croydon have, however, demon-

in any other formation.

Col. North, the Nitrate King, is giving some
attention to Australian mining. He has a representative
here, who proposes to establish big smelting and reduc-
tion works at Launceston, It is reported that he has
purchased the Star of Peace at Hill End. As to the
Colonel’s success, much will depend on the keenness of his
representative. There are but two essentials in mining
success —judgment and good luck, and, of the two, the
latter is by far the greater.

The N.S.W. Mines Department has reported
against the establishment of a School of Mines because
of the provision already made for instruction in mining
and metallurgy at Sydney University and Technical
College. Has either ever turned out a competent mining
man ? Are they ever likely to? The schools of Bendigo
and Ballarat have turned out many, some of whom are
managing mines in N.S.W. Imagine what those institu-
tions would be if Victoria possessed in abundance the
metals characteristic of N.S.W. ! Of tin Victoria pro-
duces next to nothing. The same of copper, silver, lead
and antimony. In N.S.W. each of these metals is
extensively worked ; besides, in a less degree, bismuth,
manganese, cobalt, &c., &c. The bulk of N.S.W. reef
gold is either very fine or in sulphurets, whereas that of
Victoria is mostly free and rough. Yet the N.S.W.
Minister for Mines is advised that there is no need for
even a School of Mints. N.S.W. wants much more than
a School of Mines ; it. needs a mining college so extensive
in its curriculum that it would embrace not only geology
and assaying but practical metallurgy and mining. Its
establishment would involve considerable expenditure,
but it should be a State metal work, and, like that of
Frieburg, to which thousands of tons of N.S.W. minerals
have been sent, it could be made self-supporting and be
the means of creating a new and splendid profession for
young men.

The “New Zealand and River Plate Invest-
ment C 0.,” a year or two ago, gathered up its spare coin
and retired from Maoriland to Buenos Ayres, under an
impression, so it is alleged, that the former country,
during the Ballauoe regime, wasn’t a fit place for the
investment of British capital. This unhappy institution
has just been heard of once more, after a long silence, as
having paid an emaciated dividend of 2 per cent, per
annum in Argentina. It used to pay an obese 15 per
cent, in the old days when its coin was lent out to Canter-
bury farmers. When the co. wound up its M.L. business
all the Tory papers whooped about capital being ‘‘driven
out of the country.” That capital will never drive back
to the same country any more, but it hopes to walk back
on crutches some day when it has got rested after its
Argentine experiences.

A Maltese charwoman has broken the bank-
ing record. She opened a “bank” in the squalid
island of many assorted card-sharpers, and accepted
deposits at five per cent, per week —interest payable
weekly. The business boomed till the deposits reached
£loo,ooo—then it burst; assets one dii ty old woman and
a mattress. The vv e died charwoman, who seems to
have been out of her mind, if She ever had one, knew
nothing of the principles of banking. There was no
champagne, no boom balance-sheets, no big banking-
premises ; she simply took deposits in a hovel with the
windows stuffed with brown paper and rags, and paid the
interest out as long as any money came in. She didn’t
even buy herself a new frock out of the proceeds; she
didn’t float a single company, or invest the money in any-
thing; as it came in she put it in a barrel, or a packing
case, and the wretched old banker even lost her sleep
sitting up at nights—for no salary at all—to see that
nobody ran away with the barrel. She didn’t know
that there was anything unsound in her financial
system until one day when she got down to the
bottom of the vat in looking for the money to pay the
interest on a deposit, and ascertained that she was
s one-broke, with unlimited liabilities ; and even then
she couldn’t realise how on earth the thing came to pass,
but concluded that the bank was possessed by a devil.
There was nothing dignified about the winding-up—no
liquidators at £lOOO per annum, no shareholders’ meet-
ing, no calls, no official assignee—only an old woman in
rags, weeping on the floor of the bank, and nothing more.

A curious political sign in Brisbane (Q.) is
that the principal land-and-property auctioneers
are sorry (?) that Premier Griffith has accepted
the Chief Justiceship of Queensland. It is
thoroughly understood that many members of
Parliament voted the extra ,£lOOO to the Chief
Justice’s salary, in the hope of getting rid of
Griffith, whose reputation has been thus openly
stated— “ He’s bound to come on top, because he
will always turn round and join and lead the
crowd that is on top, no matter what past profes-
sions of opinions he is compelled to swallow. He
actually has no guiding creed except his own cold-
blooded ambition, and the best thing that can
happen all parties is to shunt him.” There’s a
monument to deserve, if you like
Dear Bulletin, —lf Dickson, Powers,
Groom, Gannon and Donaldson —with Dickson

Dickson-led party need not be expected to “down”
the “ Kanaka - importing - meat - exporting - land-
grab” crowd. Dickson, the land-auctioneer, would
be throwing away the “ vittles ” of his congeners
if he “downed” land-grab. Dickson, the recent
Grifßlwraithian opponent of Labour-man Fitz-
gerald at Bulimba, supported the Kanaka policy
of the horrible Coalition Government. Charlie
Powers poses as a broad-minded reformer, but is
simply a weathercock to ail winds that blow.
Groom is an old parliamentarian, but an old fox
full of tricky knowledge. Gannon teas straight,
but his interests have also been too long connected
with auctioneering to bode popular good. Donald-
son is a complaisant any thing, who has “formally ”
bidden farewell to public life. You don’t mention
J. G. Drake. No wonder. He who was a thorn
in the side of the Griffilwraith has been nicely
shelved by foisting him into an arbitrator’s billet,
worth many hundreds a year. —H.O.
Dear Bulletin, — In your last issue one
“S.A.R.” puts in a plea for the misuse of the
aspirate, and wants to know why you harp so on
the brutal injustice done by Parkes to that
unoffending letter. “Is it not possible,” he says,
“ that the men who omit tiie use of the aspirate
except for special emphasis ” (hemphasis, I suppose
he means) “ are more progressive and correct
than those who are painfully precise about their
h’s?” It’s just possible they are. But where
does the man who omits his final “ g’s ” come in
under this theory? When a big, fat person
tells you that he’ll “ ’ave some more pudden’,” is
that also a sure sign 'that he is progres-
sive and correct? Also, what about the man
who leaves out auxiliary words and says
“ I done it,” instead of “ I have done it ?” I sup-
pose he is even still more progressive. “S.A.R.”
points out that “the people of a country are the
best authorities as to the pronunciation of its
language.” Are they? There are 29 different
ways of pronouncing the English language in
England, and they are so widely different that
the Lancashire man and the Somerset man
can understand each other about as well as
a Choctaw understands a Greek. The only
places in the British Isles that I know of where
pure English is spoken are Dublin and Inverness.
According to your correspondent, when Parkes says
“ heny ” instead of “ any ” he does it for emphasis.
What’s the matter with “hanythink” then? Does
the final “ k ” add a little more hemphasis, vigour,
correctness, and progression ? Also, just think
how much vigour there must be in the phrase,
“We hare sevenk.” More than half the people
of England commonly tack on an “ r ’ to words
ending with a vowel, and pronounce “ Eliza ” as
“ Helizar.” I presume the “r” in that case is
more emphasis, vigour, progression, &c. The
same applies, I expect, to the superfluous
syllable, which the provincial Englishman
puts into “ Henry,” which he generally pro-
nounces “’Enncry.” “S.A.R.” says that the
majority of literate Englishmen omit the aspirate
except when they wish to be emphatic. That is
just where he is wrong; the Englishman who
takes liberties with the aspirate follows one simple
rule—he leaves out the “h ” where it ought to be
and inserts it where it ought not to be. The same
Parkes who says “heny” when he wants to be
unusually vigorous in bis language will ask for a
“ ’N’s hegg ” for breakfast without turning an
’air. Just here I may mention that I recognise in
the initials “S.A.R.” those of a tolerably well-
known man about Sydney who is himself pretty
loose in his aspirates, therefore I suppose he is
really apologising for y’imself rather than for
Parkes. —Yours, &c., T.S.

Judge Williams and Dr. Madden are not
the best of friends. The Bulletin, however, has
reason to believe that Madden will not resign the
Chief Justiceship on this account. He is a lot
tougher than Salomons.

The Countess of Kintore, who finds $

Judge Hodges (Vic.) admits having con-
templated a return to the bar. Ho has been hit
hard over the land, and they say he made <£lo,ooo

Higinbotham (Argus, Jan. 7, ’93) unintentionally
emphasises an important fact in the life of the
late Chief Justice. In referring to the political
career of Higinbotham frequent reference is made
to men who held prominent positions at the time,
all being plain “ misters.” But in speaking to-
day of their actions in the past it is necessary to
refer to them, in almost every instance as “Mr.
(now Sir so-and-so”)—the only “Mister” who
retained his “ Mr.” being George Higinbotham.

Mr. J. T. Ryan, a newspaper-man who
would appear to be facile princeps in Australia as

man that he has never met with Marcus Clarke’s
“For the Term of his Natural Life.” There

says he does, but because Clarke’s book —one of
the great novels of the century—is the work of
a colonial, it must be “Cwude!”
The prospect of feud upon the Victorian
Bench, between Chief Justice Madden and
“ Heartless ” Williams, recalls the fact that Red-
mond Barry fully expected the Chief Justiceship
of Victoria when A’Beckett retired. However,
Stawell, who was Attorney-General, appointed
himself, and thereby grievously affronted Barry,
who for years would take a circuit of the old
Courthouse rather than pass StaweU's chambers
while on his way to his favourite “ New ” Court-
house. Though sitting on the Chief’s right in
Banco, no words of friendship were ever inter-
changed. On one occasion—in the old monthly-
mail days—Barry wanted an early adjournment
to write Ids letters, and suggested that the Bar
might also wish to write its letters. The Bar did,
but Stawell quietly said : “The Court will sit till
five.” And it did.

with ruthless retrenchment because his pay is
voted annually on the Estimates. Why should
not every official’s screw- from the Governor’s to

England’s blue-jackets are her pride and

Workhouse (good alternative name for England,
by the way), Fulham Road, London, to the Daily

of age, in fair health, totally destitute, and friend-
less.”
Somebody sends us a report to the effect
that the Universal Review (London) is about to
lie resurrected. The Bulletin devoutly hopes
this is true. The Universal was the only
amusing magazine we remember. Its central
principle seemed to be that nothing was ever done
by the person who was supposed to have done it,
and that nothing was ever left undone by the
person who was supposed not to have done it,
also that all the good characters in history were
really infamous, and all the bad characters
eminently loveable. It maintained an attitude
of refined and culchawed despair on religious
matters, and professed to believe, more or less, in
Dagon and Baal, and it eloquently whitewashed
Jezebel. Further, it illustrated almost every sub-
ject it touched with a beautiful engraving of a
woman with hardly anything on. The Universal
was the only magazine on record which could
drag in so much undressed lady every time. s

Had “Andy” Kelly’s attempt in N.S.W.
Assembly to am’eild Barton’s Federation resolu-

The death of the N.S.W. Superintendent

Never, since Stawell, has the Victorian
Attorney-General been a man who could appoint
himself to the Chief Justiciary without clamour,
and yet this power is retained. Even Higin-
botham and Wrixon, when in office, could not
have thus advanced themselves, without a row.
Barton’s promise to graft a “ One-man-
one-vote” clause into the Federation proposals,
when in committee, won him several votes not
only against Kelly’s anti plurality amendment
but for his Federation resolutions. Labour-
member Cook, who ought to have known better,
was one of the nobbled.

Civil Service reform is all on the cards in

The Argus referred to this speech as “most
unpleasant,” “ a discordant note,” &c. The truth
is often unpleasant.
Dibbs has begun to think of riding fm* a 1
fall, and Parkes and Barton are co-operating to
keep him in office until the object of theiit
Imperial masters is served.- The instant the
Federation Bill is disposed of Parkes will emerge
from his political lair and plot to relieve Dibbs of
the Premiership. When Parkes begins to air his
cant phrase, “If I were in office again, which I
trust I never shall be,” as lie has done several 1
times of late, it is always suggestive of political
thunder—and treachery.
The touchstone of G. Republican Dibbs 9
sincerity in the matter of N.S.W. military
retrenchment is—Will he do away with the use-
less, needless Government House guard, and sub-
stitute a plain bobby ? And why on earth is that
ridiculous and expensive person, the Usher of the
Black Rod, not sent about his business ? And 1
what is the use of a Sergeant-at-Aims, considering
that the whole of his duties could easily be per-
formed by a policeman of the lowest grade, sum-
monable instantly per medium of an electric bell
in front of the Speaker ?
Bri edit’s disease is one of the most deadly
complaints that attack debilitated constitutions.
Owing to over exertion and over consumption of
nerve force, the system becomes gradually weak-
ened and relaxation sets in. The thin mem-
branes of the kidneys are the first to go, and
medical authorities state that 50 per cent, of the
deaths nowadays occur indirectly from Bright’s
disease, though the patients and their medical
advisers never even suspected the presence of such
a deadly foe. The function of the kidney is to
separate the waste fluids from the blood, to purify
it, and this process is carried on by what is
termed by physiologists “osmosis.” In weakened
systems the membranes become relaxed, and the
albumen of the blood finds its way with the waste
fluids through the kidney walls, and passes from
the body with the urine, the patient’s health and
strength thus gradually failing. Beyond the
presence of albumen in the water, albuminuria
has not any positive symptoms; but general weak-
ness-, which always leads to these serious dis-
orders-, always signifies its presence by special
signs. You may get headache, spasmodic tooth-
ache,, torturing neuralgia, pain in small of the
back,, disinclination to work, heavy, aching limbs
on waking in the morning,, bloodshot eyes, poor
appetite, or constipation. These warning symp-
toms must not be neglected, or as sure as a rat
hole will sink a ship, so sore will the patient’s life
be sacrificed. The remedy indicated is Clements
Tonic; this will restore all organs to a proper
healthy state, and ensure correct performance of
the processes of digestion, assimilation, perspi- ’
tion, secretion, and elimination. Clements Tonic
has a record of cures effected such as no other
medicine ever secured, and we are willing to prove
our representations by outside evidence. A case
ito point is that of Captain P. Connelly, 20 Elliott-
street, Balmain, Sydney, New South Wales, who
writes ;■ —‘'Three months ago my wife, 55 years of
age, was confined to her bed, unable to move, I
called in Dr. , of Balmain, who pronounced
the case as hopeless, and beyond all human skill,
it being a general breaking-up of the system. He
further told me she was in a high state of fever
(what kind he did not state). Her temperature
was 105. She was quite unconscious, and appar-
ently not far from her end. She remained under
his treatment for about ten days, during which
time she took the medicine he prescribed without
the least improvement. On his third visit he
again pronounced the ease as hopeless, and told
me to give no medicine, but plenty of nourish-
ment, and if I liked I could call in another
medical man. I could see my wife rapidly sink-
ing, and having heard of Clements Tonic, I
determined to try it. I purchased a bottle from
Mr. —«•—, chemist, of Balmain. When the
doctor paid his fourth visit I had given her three
doses, and noticed a decided improvement.
When the doctor saw my wife he told me that,
wonderful to say, she was better, and he repeated
his former statement, and told me not to be
astonished if she died at any moment. I told him
what I had been giving her, and he said it was no
use giving it. I persevered with Clements Tonic,
and the fourth large bottle completely restored
her to health. She is now able to go about as
well as ever, and do her own housework ; in fact,
she has since attended to her daughter and niece
through their eon linemen ts, and nursed a friend
through typhoid fever. I feel so thankful to you
for your Clements Tonic that I should bo acting
ungratefully if I did not ac knowledge the wonder-
ful cure your C eun nts Tonic has made. I may
say that in every ease I advise people to try it, it
has had the same effect. I am well known in
Balmain, holding as I do several medals from the
Royal Humane Society for saving life. Anyone
wishing to see me personally and ask me about
Clements Tonic can always find me at the above
■address. —I remain, yours faithfully, Capt. P.
Connelly, 20 Elliott-street, Balmain, N.S.W.

In Central
Queensland, the other
day there was de-
tected a very bad case
of “stacking” in a
game of Nap at A
card -club. The
offender was prbuiptly
kicked intb the
street.
The Melbourne detectives obligingly plo-
fess to believe that the Victorian Parliamentary
mace was not removed “for a lark,” but stolefi
for the sake of gain, and the proprietor bf tlie
Ballarat Cociuhr has had to apologise at the
bar of the Assembly for having Wade a statement
to the contrary. Nevertheless,, setae who prbfess
to be “in the kUOMv-,’ Assert thAt the detectives
are perfectly 'Ovell Awake that the nta'deHs kt presdnt
or Was lately located at A fiOtoViofis 'e'ity den of
prostitution, vVhitlrdr it Was cbnVeyed by Aertai'n
drunken politicians, and that .the lio'uns of the
establishment and their male ‘friertas have, durtrfg
(Imnke'n Orgies, laid the niaCe dn the table With
the whisky-aud-soda, and shouted ih choktis —
“ Take away that bauble-!” The mace is supposed
to be the outward and visible sign of the authority
and dignity of the Speaker. So it is.
If the Speaker’s mace really was stolen from
the keeping of an ineffably degraded and dis-
credited Parliament, and transferred to a place
where, in Yankee phrase, “it properly belongs,”
the fact is only an evidence of the eternal fitness
of things. Supposing it gets to be known for a
tact in. London that some old harridan of a pro-
curess has the Joss of the Victorian Legislative
Assembly locked up in her chest of drawers,
Victorian shecuritiea ought to go up so fast that
people will be able to hear the gold growing on
them.
For the rumours circulated with respect to the
mace. Premier Shiels and Co. have only them-
selves to thank. It “ was not in the public
interest” that the Government should disclose
what they knew about tbe circumstances atten-
dant on “ the bauble’s” disappearance. When-
ever Shiels has publicly struck a mysterious
attitude, and let it be known that “mum’s the
word,” it has invariably been found that he was
endeavouring to distract attention from something
with a particularly evil odour.

Editor Bulletin — Sir,—The Queensland
Postmaster-General now ukases that no officer of
his depaftmdnt drawing a salary less than £l6O
per a'nfibin will be permitted To marry without his
(the P.M. General’s) express permission. One
unfortunate, drawing £l5O, “ chanced it” and got
married Oil the quiet, as he saw no prospect of an
increase for sOme years. The fket became,officially
known, and the offender was promptly “Uh-
macked ” by being transferred tb a %tat!oi\ \\\ the
Far West where it Wa§ ftexT \6 iibpossible *to 'take
his wife, tie bobbin’t Vefdße .tA go ot ap'peal, as
his only legitimate ekeiise \Vbiild ‘haVe 'proved tlie
disregard 6f King Theqdd'fe’s iroii regulation.
The telegraphists would like to kno\V if this new
rule is not a direct infringement of the liberty
of the subject, and consequently illegal. It is, no
doubt, a direct incentive to ah immoral life, for as
things go at present in Queensland a “learner”
ehterihg the telegraph department at 18 years (the
minimum age) will be at least 50 before lie can get
married. —Telegraphist.

When the son of a well-known Banana-
laud brewer was courting a pretty barmaid (to
whom lie lias since been happily" married), his
dad—a pippin of rare eccentricity but many good
points-having heard rumours of the infatuation,
which the young man was trying to keep dark, said
to him : “ Look here, I don’t know whether there
is any truth in it or not, and I’m not anxious to
believe it, but I have beard that you are engaged
to a barmaid. What have you got to say about
it?” “Well, father,” murmured the obstinate
man, “ I think I’m only following your own
example.” The old man thenceforward smiled on
the suit.

There are districts in N.S. Wales where
many of the inhabitants not only have never seen
any town larger than a sixth-rate collection of
humpies, but have no desire to do so. They
regard Sydney as the country yokels of England
used to do London 60 or 70 years ago. They live
on their own selections and are comfortably off.
Strikes and labour-troubles affect them nothin
fact they rarely, if ever, see a newspaper. The
younger branches go in for the “ Deadwood Dick ”
kind of literature combined with horse-breaking.
A lady from one of these Arcadian retreats came
down to Sydney, the other day. Although the
mother of several children and well-to-do, she had
never seen a shop-window before she arrived in the
metropolis. Still she had original notions of her
own, and although she had made up her mind to
buy many things, there was one, above all, to be
the first consideration. It was-“-a tailor-made
dress.

D'eat Bulletin, — Analogous to your

yarn is ah Adelaide '(S.A.) story of years ago.

ment servant, much persecuted by duns, who

Why ? Because he wore, when inside, a wig and

Copy of a telegram sent from Sydney, on
a recent Saturday, by a presumptuous man, on
behalf of himself and wife, to a suburban acquaint-
ance ; “ We invite ourselves to dinner to-morrow.
Make due preparations . ” The sender actually
wanted to forward this “collect,” but the regula-
tions prevented that outrage. Which somehow
reminds the writer of a well-known Bananaland
civil-servant, who has been everything from
D -puty-Sub-Assistant Secretary in the Tally
Office to Chief Penwiper in the Nibs Department,
and who may be further recognised when described
as au Irishman wearing the prenominal “Mac.”
I hi.s Macßally had somewhat inflated notions of his
own importance arid of the social respect due to him.
Being pressed to dine with a friend, he con-
descendingly accepted the invitation. On facing
the family board, the uplifting of the covers
corned-beef and carrots. “ Fwhat’s this,
me good woman,” says Macßally, “corn-beef
and carrots. Fwhere’s the poltery? D’ye mane
to say that whin a jintleman uv moy rank con-
discinds to grace your table, ye have nothing
bethur nor corn-beef to give him ? Ye should have
had ducks, or a goose, or turkey, or, at the very
laste, a pair uv fowls. Doan’t ye -let this occur
agin.” And he meant it in dead earnest.

N.S.W, State-school experience proves
that girls learn reading, writing, spelling, geog-

A certain N.S.W. State-school inspector,

In reply to your advertisement in to-night’s Star for a
young man for a country store, I beg to make application
for the situation. I have been in the grocery business for
over six years as a buyer, and have driven a cab. lam a
strict teetotaller, and a thoroughly earnest Christian. I
am not in favour of half-holidays, but would like my
liberty two or three times a week of an evening to enable
me to institute open-air prayer meetings in your town.
The wages I must leave entirely to your own opinion of
my qualifications. I do not gamble, or have never been
mi a racecourse in my life, as I hold that races are only
fit for swine and such like. As far as my character is
concerned, I beg to refer you to Mr. B. or Mr. A., of
Dunedin. I must apologise for trespassing so much on
your valuable time, hut when I think of the terrible
amount of sin that is going on around us I wander from
my subject. In conclusion I am quite sure that should
you give me a trial I shall afford entire satisfaction.

In Sydney, last Thursday, a Dutchman,
named Van Kaspelen, shot his landlady under
the impression that she was his wife. This shows
that a man should always make sure it is his
wife before shooting. When he discovered his
mistake he shot himself, and now he and the
landlady are both dead, while the wife remains
alive.
If any further assurance of the truth of
the reported engagement of Duke George to Mary
of Teck were needed (says our London correspon-
dent by last mail, before the official announcement
was made), it would be afforded by the anxiety of
onr great “territorial magnates” to have the
Tecks to stay with them at their country houses.
If all were not well in the matrimonial line, the
Tecks might go hang before they would be invited
to plant their feet under the Duke of West-
minster’s mahogany at Eaton Hall.

The Victorian divorce - law is badly
muddled. Not long since, in the case of Jackson
v. Jackson, Judge Hodges refused a separation on
the ground that the petitioner had been deserted
by her husband in N.S. Wales, and though she
had afterwards lived for many years in Victoria,
and her husband had never returned to her or
contributed to her support, the question of
domicile was held to be fatal. There is nothing
in the Act declaring that a wife must be deserted
in Victoria in order to obtain a divorce under
Victorian law, yet, according to Judge Hodges, it
would appear that if a man living at Wodonga
lures his wife just over the border to Albury and
abandons her there, she can never afterwards
obtain redress in her own province ! On the other
hand, in the case of Ctagne v. Clagne, which was
built bn an exactly similar plan, Judge Williams
granted the application without demur. It would
be interesting to know what the Victorian divorce-
law really is. Perhaps these two Judges will
kindly talk the matter over.

for correct time. The operator having a couple of
cartridges on hand together with a gun behind the
screen, gravely informs his visitor that he will, as
a favour to him, have the sound of the Brisbane
1 p.m. gun transmitted along the wire. A few
seconds elapse and an explosion occurs. The
magistrate, staggers back and exclaiming ; “ By
the holy St. Patrick, that’s wonderful. No doubt
‘about it, Oi can shmell the powdher!” and totters
off. To this day he believes he heard the Brisbane

On a Far Northern goldfield, some years
ago, the diggers affectionately fraternised with
the local gins, until a much-married digger got
knocked on the head by a blackfellow. The
diggers, resenting the familiarity, concerted on a
certain day to blot out the black cause from the
face of the district. On the fatal morning a
humane but vacillating gold-hunter, with his boy
well under cover of a Colt, hesitated. “Shoot
the !” said his mate. “ Ek-ek-xcuse me,”
replied the vacillating one, “ this is the f-f-Frst
m-murder I have ever corn-mum-mitted.” Bang !
And the man who hesitated had joined the army
of the fittest.

“Faustine,” writing in Sydney Daily
Telegraph
One small literary contribution on the subject there is
to chronicle —a pamphlet by a well-known member of the
Women’s Liberal Federation, published in answer to Mr.
Gladstone’s diatribe against the granting of the suffrage
to women. “It is not by depriving women,” she says,
“or any portion of womanhood, of her just rights that
you can preserve her delicacy, purity, and refinement; it
is not by accentuating sex that you can promote the
elevation of her oivn nature; it is by upholding that
which makes her a human being in its full sense, free of
choice, with issues as vast as those you possess yourself—a
soul as divine— an immortality as profound. If delicacy
and refinement are the results of the old system of regard-
ing womanhood, what are we to say of our music-halls,
our casinos, of such a spectacle as the Strand pre-
sents any night in London, and of the various
diversions which are brought forward for the dubious
amusement of men. In these sex is the supreme and
central attraction, and unfortunately the present
“sources of its power” are very far from being on the
plane which ivould make man noble, and woman free.
The whole article is logical, incisive, yet thoroughly
womanly; and if the “grand old man” is still uncon-
vinced by it, he must feel, at least, that he has in the
writer an antagonist worthy of his steel.
Flapdoodle ! Notice the italics. They are ours.
Was there ever a more damnable abusing of the
English language? Was there ever seen a slip-
shoddier piece of composition ? But that’s not the
worst. Half the italicised expressions are point-
blank mistakes, ignorances. “Womanhood” for
womankind; “free of choice’’—what does it
mean? “Issues,” “the possession of issues,”
only calls to mind the afflicted old lady in the
Scriptures. And can one immortality be more
“profound” than another? And yet, forsooth,
such stuff is “logical, incisive, and thoroughly
womanly.” It is thoroughly feminine, right
enough.

iPoOr Fitz Gibbon 1 “ When he had b'ceVi
at ‘home,’ sitting am'bngst hundreds of men in a
hotel, he had looked around on faces that seemed
as familiar as those he saw before him now. It
pained him to the heart, however, to find that
they did not know him.”
The Bulletin is getting kind of sick of
the theory that the Australian is better ediicated
than the rest of humanity. Recently, at Wer-
ron RR llr t (Vic.), a man Was found hanging by the
neck from a tree. One of his finders started away
in search of that vague and hazy thing which is
described as “help,” and the other stayed to
watch the suspended figure. What good the
watching was expected to do isn’t defined, and is
never likely to be. The hanged person wasn’t
dead, but both his discoverers were possessed of
that old English superstition that it is a felony
to cut down a suicide until a policeman, or a J.P.",
or a Commissioner for Affidavits, or a pound-
keeper, arrives on the scene, so they let him hang.
It was three hours before a duly constituted
authority arrived and took the dangling citizen
down. He was dead by that time, and has
remained dead ever since.
THE DUTIES OF AN AIDE-DE-CAMP.
Oh, some folk think vice-royalty is festive and hilarious,
The duties of an A.D.C. are manifold and various,
So listen, whilst I tell in song,
The duties of an aide-de-cong.
Whatsoever betide
To the Governor’s side
We must stick - or the public would eat him
For each bounder we see
Says, “ Just introduce me
To his Lordship—l’m anxious to meet him.”
Then they grab at his paw
And they chatter and jaw
Till they’d talk him to death—if we’d let ’em—
And the folk he has met,
They are all in a fret,
Just for fear he might chance to forget ’em.
When some local King Billy
Is talking him silly,
Or the pound-keeper’s wife has waylaid him,
From folks of that stamp
When he has to decamp—
We’re his aides to decamp—so we aid him.
Then some feminine beauty
Will come and salute ye,
She may be a Miss or a Madam,
Or a man comes in view,
Bails you up, “ How de do !”
And you don’t know the fellow from Adair I
But you’ve got to keep sweet
With each man that you meet,
And a trifie like this mustn't bar you,
So you clutch at his fin,
And you say, with a grin,
■“ Oh, delighted to see you —how are you ?”
Then we do country shows
Where some prize-taker blows
Of his pig—a great, vast forty-stoner—
“ See, my Lord ! ain’t he fine !”
“ How is that for a swine !”
When it isn’t a patch on its owner!
We fix up the dinners
For parsons and sinners
And lawyers and bishops and showmen,
And a judge of the court
We put next to a “ sport,”
And an Orangeman next to a Roman.
We send invitations
To all celebrations,
Some Nobody’s presence entreating,
And the old folks of all
We invite to a ball,
And the young—to a grandmothers’ me li ig.
And when we go dancing,
Like cart-horses prancing.
We plunge where the people are thickenin',
And each gay local swell
Thinks it’s “ off ” to dance well,
So he copies our style - ain’t it sickenin’!
Then at banquets we dine
And swig cheap, nasty wine.
But the poor aide-de-camp mustn’t funk :
And they call it champagne,
But we’re free to maintain,
That he feels real pain when he’s drunk it.
Then our horses hestri ling
We go out a-riilio '
Lest our health by conlineine it we’d injure ;
You cm notice the glare
Of the Governor's hair
When the little h >ys s.iy, “ Go it, Ginger I”
Then these wandering lords—
They so often are frauds
This out-of-way country invading,
If a in in dresses well
And behaves like a swell,
Then he’s somebody’s cook masquerading.
But an out-aud-ont ass
With a thirst for the glass
And (he symptoms of drink on his “ boko,”
Who is perpetually
Pursuing the ballet,
lie is always the “ true Orinoco.”
We must slave with our quills—
Keep the cash-pay the bills -
Keep account of the liquor and victuals—
So I think you’ll agree
That the gay A.D.C.
Has a life that’s not all beer and skittles !
THE MODERN MOTTO.
“Cant not of honesty— cash down.”— Dipsomaniac.
“ In days of old, when knights were hold,”
And iron togs were quite the thing,
The custom was, as we are told,
For war-cries o’er the field to ring,
The whiles the sword with mighty swing
Through shield, and helm, and skull would crash,
This motto to our fights we bring—
“ln God we trust—all others, cash.”
The valiant knights are stark and cold—
Their day is done, they’ve had their fling
No more they prick o’er hill or wold.
No more they hear the minstrels sing.
Their mottoes, too, have taken wing—
Their notions with our ways would clash ;
We’re wiser now in everything—
In God we trust—all others, cash.
No faith in man or maid we hold
(That flourished only in earth’s spring!*
We kneel before the Calf of Gold,
Like Israel in Ls wandering—
Though some poor dreamers yet would cling
To truth and suoh-like simple trash
Above their prayers our chant shali ring—
In God we trust— all others, cash.
Envoi.
Lady ! What dowry do you bring?
To wed for love were somewhat rash—
In marriage, as in everything,
In God we trust —all others, cash.

“IT FEARS NEITHER ARMY NOR
NAVY.”
Those things used to bo called the wooden walls
of England.
The scene was the Naval Exhibition at Chelsea,
in the Summer of 1891. The speaker was a young
man, and his auditor one of those lithe, bright-
haired girls one so often sees in this island.
“ And aren’t they the wooden walls of England,
now ?” she said, as a child might ask when Noah
might be expected in Liverpool with his ark.
“Not exactly,” replied her escort, tenderly;
“ they are rather out of style. Come ; I’ll show
what sorts of walls we have now,” and he led her
off in the direction of the beautiful models of the
great steel ships of war.
The young fellow was right in assuming that
this country had a big and powerful navy, but the
chances of war decrease with the preparations
made to meet it. Besides, the interests that
would be put to hazard grow constantly larger and
nations avoid fighting as long as possible.
This is a hopeful consideration, and if England
had nothing to be afraid of beyond the danger of
being attacked from abroad, we might sleep in
peace. But there is an enemy against which
neither army nor navy is of any avail. It defies
the gunboats in the Channel and the redcoats on
the shore, and kills more people than are ever
likely to fall in battle.
If we could stop the ravages of this foe we
should soon be able to surprise our distant colonies
with the arrival among them of a splendid class of
our surplus population.
We allude, of course, to disease. Not to epi-
demics of cholera or influenza, but to diseases
which are at work year in and year out, in every
season, carrying off rich and poor alike. Unques-
tionably the worst of these is the one that attacks
the digestive system, the one from which springs
the majority of ailments, which go under various
names, as, for example, rheumatism, gout,
bronchitis, consumption, the several fevers, and
others which were formerly, erroneously, supposed
to have distinct characters, and to require distinct
treatment.
Now, however, the best medical authorities
recognise these ailments as symptoms and out-
growths of indigestion and dyspepsia, and treat
them accordingly. In illustration of what can be
done, we cite a single case. A man named
Edward Kelly, who resides at 27, St. Vincent
Street, London Road, Liverpool, having pre-
viously had perfect health, experienced a dull
pain in the right side, a bad taste in the mouth,
furred tongue, loss of appetite, discoloured skin,
unnatural langour and fatigue, and what he des-
cribes as a “sinking feeling,” as though the sup-
porting power were exhausted beneath him.
This was in 1887, and he bore it without obtain-
ing relief from the usual medical treatment until
April, 1890, when one day, when he was working
in a bonded warehouse, he says, “ a dreadful pain
struck me in the back, and I had great trouble in
getting through my work. Getting worse,” he
continues, “I went to a doctor, who said it was
inflammation of the kidneys. He gave me
medicine and attended me off and on for six
months, but with no beneficial result. He said he
could not understand how I could keep on with
my work. Still, I did struggle on, though the
disease was wearing me out. From a strong, able
man, I became thin and weak, and was afraid I
should have to give up my work. Last July,
1890, a Custom House officer recommended me to
try an advertised preparation, entitled Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. I did so, and before I had
finished the first bottle the pain left my back, and
I began to digest ray food and gain strength. By
continuing to use this remedy I was soon as well
as ever in my life. My master, seeing what the
Syrup had done for me, also took it for indiges-
tion, with so much benefit that now he always
keeps it by him. I have no interest whatever in
testifying thus, aAd only speak of the medicine as I
found it.”
Mr. Kelly evidently had a narrow escape from
Bright’s disease, a malady very common among
all classes in England, and one of the surest and
most direct products of torpid liver, itself a
symptom of indigestion and dyspepsia. We
mention this case not to put money in anybody’s
pocket, but for the sake of the sufferers who need
help—no matter what it comes from.
A NURSE’S REPORT.
Medical men say that a good nurse in a diffi-
cult case is better than medicine, but when we
can get a good nurse and good medicine, the
patient stands a much better chance of recovery.
The few words of advice given below by nurse
Eliza King, of Great Massingham, Swaffham, are
well worthy the attention of all readers of this
paper. They are as follows : “ I have constantly
used St. Jacobs Oil in the various situations I
have occupied as nurse, and have invariably found
it excellent in all cases requiring outward applica-
tions, such as sprains, bruises, rheumatyi affec-
tions, neuralgia, &c. In cases of pleurisy it is an
excellent remedy—well rubbed in. I can strongly
recommend it, after several years’ use and ex-
perience. It should be in every household.”
Sister Carolina, St. Andrew’s Hospital, Clewer,
Windsor, writes: “I take this opportunity of
stating that I have found St. Jacobs Oil a most
efficacious reqaedy in goutalso in sprains and
bruises. Indeed, we cannot say too much in its
praise, and our doctor is ordering it constantly.”
Henry and Ann Bright, hon. superintendents
of the North London Home for Aged Christian
Blind Women, says that a remedy has proved
itself unfailing; that rheumatism and neuralgia
have, in every ease, been removed by St. Jacobs
Oil—the remedy referred to—and that many old
ladies, some of them 90 years old, instead of toss-
ing about in agony, now enjoy a good night’s rest
through its influence. Mrs. Bright says she can-
not say enough in its favour.
Six gold medals have been awarded to St.
Jacobs Oil for its marvellous power to relieve and
cure pain. It acts like magic. It cures when
everything else has failed. It has cured people
who have been lame and crippled with pain over
20 years. It cures rheumatism, neuralgia, face-
ache, backache, sprains, and other bodily pains.
It is an external remedy. It penetrates to the
seat of the disease. It is simple, safe, and sure.

The European dynamite business, now so
widely advertised, reminds one of the commercial
traveller who some years ago placed some frozen
dynamite samples to dry at a N.S.W. hotel fire.
An explosion followed which nearly shifted the
house, and the unfortunate traveller was scattered
in bits to the four winds. The largest piece of him
picked up was found at the top of a tree, and was
but the size of a decent mutton chop.
A lollyshop in the most fashionable quarter
of London sold souvenirs of Tennyson’s funeral
in the form of black peppermint-balls. Pasted
against the centre window and immediately over
a crape-trimmed pyramid of chocolate-creams was
a card inscribed—“ In Memoriam. Lord Tenny-
son. Sleep sweetly.” The most charitable ex-
planation of the lollypop man’s hideous joke is
that it was intended to satirise the rnaudlin
sentiment which deluged London at the time.
One passenger killed, in the Scotch express
accident had just provided for his family before
catching the train. At the railway bookstall he
bought about a dozen of the petty periodicals
which include an accident-insurance coupon
amongst their pirated pictures and paragraphs.
These were found carefully stuffed into the
pockets of the corpse, who wore a sardonic
chuckle on his cold, grey face. One of these days
a gigantic railway smash will be followed by a
rush of weeping widows, each carrying a blood-
stained copy of Prigged Bits, Funny Thikvings,
or what not, to the offices of those catchpenny
papers, all of which will go hopelessly insolvent
forthwith.
It must be admitted that since Bismarck has
been called upon to assert his unofficial indi-
viduality he seems a bigger fraud the more you
look at him. In his boom days he had a simple
bayonet policy, based on the notion that old,
woolly-headed William would live for ever. Be-
lieving in the immortality of that steel-plated
ancient, Bismarck snorted at the mother of a
future emperor, and the lady slowly and im-
perceptibly taught her son that the world would
get along just as well without Bismarck. Ihe
son, being an overbearing young cub, liked the
idea, and so, when old William died, his old
Chancellor practically died likewise, and the
world has got along a lot better without him.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“Walter Giffen is a certainty for the Australian
team.” Of course:—
Such a hue-and-cry is being made after Walter
Gillen’s scalp by the Sydney press that no time is given
to picking out much greater flaws in the constitution of
the team for England.
* » *
George Giffen holds the right end of the stick.
He says Walter must go if he goes, and as the team
cannot very well do without him, it is most probable that
Walter must go, any amount of printers’ ink to the
contrary notwithstanding.
* * *
New South Wales, which has just beaten South
Australia in an innings, is very badly treated with only
three men in the team.
* * *
Gregory’s batting and fielding should find him
a place in any team ; and that Graham, a man who has
made his reputation upon one innings, should be in before
Iredale and Dcnnan, is not fair to Australian cricket.
# * »
Donnan, they say, is a grumbler ; and Iredale
is not of physique sufficiently strong to stand the strain
of an English tour.
* * *
The grumbling excuse is weak, for where could
greater Dick Deadeyes be found than Blackham, and
Charley ” Turner when his bowling does not come off ?
* * #
As for Iredale’s strength, be is strong enough
to make his nineties and centuries, and it is hard to say
the style of man who is most likely to “ come off ” in
England. Evans) Trott, Bruce, Lyons, and Trumble were
not successes, and Blackham did not shine as a batsman.
Men of Callaway’s stamp are likely to improve on such a
trip, but it is indeed hard to say.
* * #
Bannerman has coached and thereby spoilt
Donnan.
* * #
Twice this season C. Richardson, playing for
the Sydney Belvideres, has gone in first and carried his
bat out on a bad wicket against Turner and Cos.
# * #
The inevitable row over the choice of an Aus-
tralian Eleven is raging fljroely.
* * *
Harry Graham, the promising Victorian bat, is
also a prominent footballer. He plays with the Mel-
bourne club, and stood third in the list of goal-kickers
last season.
* * *
Long Bonnor, the other day, made 148 not out
in a match, Orange District (J.C. -v AH Comers 15.
* # #
The big black spot on the selection of the Aus-
tralian Eleven for England is Walter Giffen, whose proper
place is in a second eleven. He is simply the brother of
George Giffen and that is all.
» * •
“The Visitors ” are often the losers in interpro-
vincial matches. N.S.W. lost in Adelaide and in Mel-
bournc. Now S. Australia has lost in Melbourne and in
Sydney.
» # #
In the matches N.S.W. v. S. Australia, Donnan
succumbed in each of his three innings to Jones.
» * *
Charles Turner, in his present form, is about
the best cricketer on earth.
# # #
Cricket maxim : Never elect a bowler captain.
Compare Giffen’s captainship with Bannerman’s in the
recent match, Bannerman’s field position is mid - off,
and this, combined with his long experience of cricket
and cricketers, constitutes him the ablest captain for the
Australian Eleven.
* * #
Sam Jones should be a warning to Messrs.
Gregory and Callaway.
* * «
Whenever the Sydney Association Ground
policeman walks off with a man who has climbed over the
fence, 50 of “ the push” scramble over in his absence.
* * *
If Walter Giffen is finally selected before Reed-
man for the Australia'i Eleven, the lat ter will have much
cause for complaint. Reedm in has headed him in general
averages for years and performed better for the province.
# # *
It was cut and dried months ago that Giffen
should go to England. George did not want to go, but
Sir Edwin Smith, a great Norwood supporter, seem ed his
leave, and an assistant has been learning Giffen’s duties
in Adelaide Post-office for months past. That is how the
present writer came (o know, before anyone else, weeks
ago, and announced the fad in these columns.

It is alleged, says an Adelaide paper, that in a
Norw ood (S. A.) Sunday-school the children are taught to
pray: “God bless father and mother; God bless our
sisters and brothers, and God bless Mr. Giffen, the great
cricketer.”

At Whangarei (M.L.) races lately, the police
borrowed a horse-box, and when they captured a spieler,
locked him up therein, instead of wasting time taking
him to the lock-up a mile or two distant. When they had
jammed one spieler into the horse-box they went back for
another, and in just 90 minutes every welsher, wheel of-
fortune man, and lottery-shark (mostly fresh importations
from Sydney) was blaspheming through the bars and
threatening awful things, if he were not Instantly set at
liberty. Then the den was wheeled away to a quiet spot
and left there till the races were over, and in the evening
it was towed into the township, where 'he Magistrate
lent all its contents up for two months.

Charley Mitchell, the pugilist, sent to gaol for
assaulting an old man in London, avers that if Haddon
Chambers, who witnessed the occurrence, had given
evidence he would have been acquitted triumphantly
when charged. But Haddon “funked” the publicity,
and refused to speak. Mitchell consequently has a
grievance against the “ gifted Australian dramatist,” and
probably some fine evening, when Charles is “a bit
sprung,” Haddon may find himself minus an eye or a
nose, or something, for by all accounts Mitchell is as
ready with his teeth as with his mawleys.

satisfied with the weights, it will pay well.

Joe Thompson, in England, opposes bookmaker-
registration, though in Australia, it was the work of his
party under a mistaken impression that it would give a

fresh crowd who have ruled the roast.

Joe Thompson (writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent; is still most unpopular with leading local
pencillers, especially with “ Red Hot ” Fry, whose busi-
ness he tried to cut into last year by laying long prices.
On one occasion he was surrounded by a big crowd,
mostly gobemouches, attracted by the quondam Levia-
than’s strident voice and the ephemeral fame he had got.
Somebody said to Fry : “ Ain’t he goin’ it, Har Haitch
(R.H.)? Look at the bloomin’ crowd round ’im.’’ “Yes,”
said Fry, very quietly, “ I see him. He is going strong;
but will he stay the course?” Well, Joe did manage to
stay the course, but he was nearly “all out,” and 1 don’t
think he will try the same distance again. He is credited
w ith having lost very heavily since he went to England,
but whether he has lost or gained, he is always to the fore
on Monday, and quite as ready to pay as to receive. He
will never be popular, however, in the ring, and backers,
even, don’t care much about him.

The clergy of Nelson (M.L-) have presented a
petition to the local Jockey Club, drawing attention to
certain abuses which are said to prevail on the local race-
course. The motive of the petitioners is evidently above
reproach, but, unfortunately, they drop into sporting
language here and there is a most unbecoming fashion.
One of the statements in the precious document sets forth
that “the public hardly ever get a fair run for their
stuff,” which sounds as if the parsons read the sporting
intelligence regularly.
The “ Grisler ’’ champagne (Messrs. Jules
Reiuird and Cos., of 30(> Kent-street, Sydney,
agents) is the coining brand. Connoisseurs who
have sampled'this bottled glory of the vineyards
declare it to be the best variety in the market.
There is probably no such thing as absolute per-
fection in champagne, any more than in anything
else-there is always room for the world and its
liquors to keep moving—but the “Grisler,” for
the present, seems to be on top.
What boots it if before attack
Of English foe our fellows falter?
I am the great Australian crack,
And love my little brother Walter.
If I should take the trip and “ tin ”
And leave him, I’d deserve a halter ;
And I’ll be hanged if 1 join in
If they pass over little Walter.
Pray, where’s the use of being great,
An indispensable big brother,
If Wally may not share the “ gate,”
And get his whack like any other?
And I shall boss the blooming team,
And bowl from May till late September ;
The Englishmen will score like steam,
But, then, one may be caught, remember!
And while nine men, disgusted, sneer,
And may in their allegiance falter,
I’ll have the moral aid of dear—
Of precious little brother Walter.
My will more mighty is than all 1
Committees may seem very knowing ;
But though we all go to the wall,
To England Wal. with us is going.

COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and

Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.” —Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.”—“ Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Tesl.monials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.” — Australian Stab.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktown Courier (Q.).
“ It may not be out of place to mention that Herr
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times.
“Herr Rassmussen’s press notices in all the other
colonies agree in regard to the skill he possesses as a Herba-
list, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to be well
established.”— S. A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen has achieved a high reputation for
his skill in botanical treatment of disease.” — Evening

A Throat

Specialty.
“German
Syrup”
Those who have not
used Boschee’s Ger-
man Syrup for some
severe and chronic
trouble of the Throat
and Lungs can hard-
ly appreciate what a truly wonder-
ful medicine it is. The delicious
sensations of healing, easing, clear-
ing, strength-gathering and recover-
ing are unknown joys. For Ger-
man Syrup we do not ask easy cases.
Sugar and water may smooth a
throat or stop a tickling—for a while.
This is as far as the ordinary cough
medicine goes. Boschee’s German
Syrup is a discovery, a great Throat
and Lung Specialty. Where for
years there have been sensitiveness,
pain, coughing, spitting, hemorr-
hage, voice failure, weakness, slip-
ping down hill, where doctors and
medicine and advice have been swal-
lowed and followed to the gulf of
despair, where there is the sickening
conviction that all is over and the
end is inevitable, there we place
German Syrup. It cures. ) You are
a live man yet if you take it. ®

Row’s Assorted Bitters

Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any ottier medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE,
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the BI00& and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

“I) George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows;
“That I feel it a duty L owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,

All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,

Baron Berzilius’-
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and" Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting dhus-
(ion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeiti a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
nIEETOTAULEiis will find this newly-invented
lOiNIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is nnsur-
passed.

ROW S, and take no substitute.

Sir Joseph Hawley, the racing man, wa s
much struck with a married lady in Italy. She
said : “I have an unmarried sister, exactly like
me, in England.” Hawley posted straight off and
married her.

professed to be a Democratic paper :—“The claim

refrigerating chambers of a meat-ship is surely
exorbitant, and there is absolutely nothing in the
plea that such work is injurious to health.” No
comment is needed.
From a letter received in Sydney from
native sources by The Bulletin, it appears that
another annexation is on the tapis. The people
of Niuh, an isolated but productive island lying
300 miles to the eastward of Tonga, are becoming
tinged with the desire to form part of “ that
glorious empire on which,” &c., &c. For the past
20 years Niuh (or Savage Island, as it is more
generally known) has been one of the richest copra
and cotton-yielding islands in the Pacific, and only
its isolated position and the peculiar character of
its inhabitants has saved it from becoming, like
•Samoa, the exploiting ground of English and
German land-sharks and adventurers. There are
about ten villages in the island containing a popu-
lation of 5000 souls, the two largest towns being
Alofi on the coast, and Hakupu in the interior.
The Savage Island native may be met with in all
parts of Oceana—from Samoa to Tahiti, and espe-
cially is he fond of working in the guano islands
in mid-Pacific, where he goes on a six or twelve
months’ agreement for ten dollars a month.
During Sir Arthur Gordon’s High Commissioner-
ship he appointed the oldest trader on the island
(a man named Head) Deputy Commissioner, but
the Savage Islanders treated the appointment
with mockery, although they had and have now
great respect for Mr. Head as a trader. Mr.
Head, who had this terrific and empty dignity
thrust upon him by Sir Arthur, has never since
had any communication from Fiji, and lives on
in happy carelessness of his latent grandeur.
But if the wish for annexation is gratified,
as doubtless it will, then it will be necessary
for quite another sort of man to be appointed
as Resident. The people of NiuS are possibly the
most cantankerous and suspicious of all Malayo-
Polynesian races—which is good for. them. About
twelve years ago, one Patterson, agent for the
German-Sainoan Goddeffroys, had the temerity to
hoist the German flag over his station when the
German brig Alfred arrived there. In ten minutes
the whole population of Alofi arose and “went
for” the trader, who barricaded himself in his
house, and announced through the keyhole that
lie only hoisted the flag out of compliment to the
ship. To. which the natives replied that they
wouldn’t even allow that; if he wished to show
the German flag, he could call the captain inside
his house to look at it, but must then put it away
in his box and lock it up ; they would not let any
trader hoist any flag on shore. Meanwhile, the
flagstaff was cut down and chopped up, and the
flag made into loin-cloths for the cliildren. When
the Goldfinch called there in 1891, the captain
sent word to Faataaiki (the king) to come and see
him. FaaJaaiki sent back word that he was at
work on his plantation and had no time to come
in and see visitors, but if the man-of-war re-
turned in a month, he might see him if he was
not too busy. Faataaiki has a fund of anecdote
about “Bully” Hayes, the Captain Kidd of the
South Pacific, and his fellow-pirate, Captain
Ben Peese. Peese, in those days, sold Mr. Head,
then a young man, a lot of trade to buy produce
with. In the course of a year he returned, and
Head, going on board, saw Hayes, whom Peese
described as a “friend, travelling on account of
his delicate health ” (Hayes was over 6ft., and
had the muscular development of a healthy
working bullock). Head brought off all the pro-
duce he had collected, and which represented a
large sum. Then the rascal, Peese, told him, to
clear off ashore again if he valued his life. A
boat was lowered, and poor Head, seeing the- folly
of resistance, got in. Hayes was in charge-, and
his apparently amiable face induced Head to make
an appeal to him, to which Hayes replied, “Waal,
I won’t see you landed altogether helpless among
these natives; I’ll make Peese give you a case
of tobacco.” The tobacco was put in,, and the
boat pulled away to a village called Aratele.
Here’the natives threatened to kill Hayes if he
landed, until Head begged them to desist and allow
him to,come ashore, Hayes, meanwhile, pressing a
pistol against the trader’s head, and saying that if
any treachery was meditated he would blow his
brains out.. Head landed safely,.and has remained
there ever since, being now a wealthy man andl
respected by. whites and natives;alike. In the-
letter referred, to there is an allusion, to,the effect
that “it will be good for us here in, many
things if an upright Judge with, a strong arm,
will punish the evil ones, white and native,” and 1
then mention is made of a white man who for
years past has been guilty of shocking crimes-
J against children of tender years, and who. calling
himself an American citizen, has managed to keep
out of the hands of any stray British man-o’-war.
And here may be related another anecdote of the
incomparable Bully Hayes. The man above
referred to once entertained the jovial pirate in
his house, and somewhat ostentatiously displayed
his cash-box containing GOO dols., stating it was
only a “month’s takings.” Whereupon the
humorous Bully—a perfect Bismarck in the grim-
ness of his brutality—swept the gold pieces into
Ids pockets, remarking that “ that was only a
day’s takings, but he would look on it as a friendly
loan.” The trader never saw it again and was too
scared to talk about it during Hayes’ life.
Savage Island is about 35 miles in circuit, round
in form, of upheaved coral formation and a steep
coast. Its position is about lat. 19° 10' South:
long. 169° 45' West.


COLLEGE, MEDICAL SCHOOL*
Glasgow, 16th Nov., 1892.
To Messrs. Bosisto and Co., —
It is with pleasure that I write to state
(ny opinion of your Eucalyptus Oil. It is de-
cidedly better than any other similar oil which
can be obtained in this country.
It is a lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil
than any I have hitherto used, besides being free
from the heavy, nauseous odour characteristic of
others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations and con-
siderably enhances its value.

fessor of Zoology, Anderson’s Coll. :

Here at Last!
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
A. MYSTERY
Which no One Can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she Would faint off, and he unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch- frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could Suggest was inedj
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, Try Mesmerism.
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of his, and so, uJ'C'i
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, 1 1 y
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest. tor a long
lime she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning ; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when

The Hat that Doomed the Man.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The baby cried, and though the wind was
blowing strongly enough to cap every wave in the
harbour with a snowy crest, his mother appeased
him by taking him in her arms up to the cliffs
that towered far above the open sea. 4 S
And the child smiled again, and clapped his
hands, called to the shrieking sea-gulls and
laughed merrily at the boisterous breeze that
swept the curls over his face.
Far below, rocking on the restless waters, was
anchored a fisherman’s boat, the sole occupant of
which was employed casting in and drawing out
his lines.
“ See old Tom fishing 1” prattled the mother,
holding her baby forward.
Boy-boy glanced down at the black blot on the
blue waves and cried : “Tam —Tam !”
But the wind was strong, and, besides, Tom was
very deaf, and Boy-boy, growing angry at not
being replied to, flung out his small hands, crying
imperatively: “Tam—Tam!”
And just then a playful gust seized Boy-boy’s
little straw hat and carried it swiftly downwards,
till it lay floating amid the gathering foam at the
foot of the rocks. 1
The mother, fearing the child might take cold, I
cuddled the bare yellow head to her bosom and
ran swiftly homeward, while Boy-boy kicked,
wept, and fought for freedom.
* # *
Up on a higher point of the cliffs, but
snugly stowed in a little cave that overlooked the
ocean, nestled a loving couple, sheltered, warm,
and full of a deep content.
And they, too, watched the industrious fisher-
man, and saw the baby and his mother on the
lower eminence. And they saw the hat that was
blown away, and the careful mother who turned
homeward. When next they looked away from
each other’s countenances, they beheld a man
standing where the mother and child had been,
taking off his coat. So they marvelled and looked
deep into one another’s eyes for an explanation.
When next they looked world-ward the man
was placing his boots and his hat carefully beside
his coat. 4
Whereupon they became interested, and when
he stepped firmly to the edge of the precipice,
they gasped in horrdr for they realised his inten-
tion, and when he carried it out they sprang to
their feet, clasping hands tightly; atid leant Over
the dwful heights watching him as he rolled and
tumbled down and finally struck the water and
disappeared like d, stone;
It seemed impossible fot him to haVe fespaped
touching the rocks that shotted their jagged edges
above the swirling sea, yet afi instant latef 1 they
saw him re-appeat, swinlraitlg boldly and des-
perately in widening circled. , ,
He had changed his mind —Or had he been hor-
rified by a glimpse of eternity ? .
Life, evidently, wds worth the living ! But the
waves were strong, and he was weak, and the only
human being near to help him ttas engrossed in
attending to his lines. • .
The twain on the lock regained theit voices
with one accord.
“Boat ahoy! ahoy!” How they shrieked!
And the man struggled on, while the fisherman
gazed stolidly at his swaying lines.
Ahoy ! ahoy !” Their voices ran out above the
droning of the heavy sea and the splash of the
waves against the rocky shore, his deep and pas-
sionate, hers shrill and agonised.
The man of unstable mind fought on.
The fisherman laid an expectant hand on a
jerking line when the cries from above broke on
his dulled ears, and looking up he discovered the
gesticulating couple. .
Guided by their frantic gestures he turned in
hid seat and saw an object in the water. Muttering
some anathema at being called upott to disturb
himself, he hauled up his kellick, rotted a short
distance, and then stopping reached Over and
hauled in the thing. ■ ■
They on the rocks unclasp hands and shriek
and dance and gesticulate with renewed energy.
“ All right! ” comes back to them in the hoarse
voice of the phlegmatic fisher as he waves Boy-
boy’s hat which he has rescued.
And while he waves to reassure the two who are
nearly frantic, an inscrutable Providence guides a
shark to its evening meal.
And they on the cliffs are dumb, and old lom
waves Boy-boy’s hat crying, “ All right! ”

Tales of the Riverine.
BY PRICE WARUNG.
The Incineration of Dictionary Ned.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It is a traditional belief with the sturdy
people of the Riverine district that theirs was
always an “honest man’s country”—that in the
elasticity of its atmosphere men of the shady sort
could not breathe, and their methods would not
work. Like many other good old beliefs this
particular one has no warrant in fact. What
with smuggling and “ the rebate system ” on the
rivers, and dummying and “peacocking” on
land, 1 do not think, area for area, a region can be
found in Australia where the device that is
dubious and the dodge that is dark grew to such
luxuriance. Once upon a time of very long ago
that was, of course. At the present day, it is
unnecessary to state, the men of the Riverine are
as guileless “ as they make ’em.” The breath of
the plains and the rivers is now an exhalation of
innocence—of a surety. Such a dodge as is
herein related would be of impossible happening
now.
The generation of settlers of which the parent-
age was in the Robertson Land Act was, in truth,
a very sad one. Morally speaking, I mean. As
far as spirits and tempers went, it was jovial and
companionable, but the admirable comradeship
which, on the surface, marked the country, hid
feuds and hatreds and duplicities that were so far
from admirable as to be detestable. Sometimes
the disguise was thrown aside, and “ the fine free-
handed squatter ” showed his teeth clenched men-
acingly, or the “enterprising selector” forgot his
manners and threatened and boasted that he and his
class would pick the eyes out of every run in the
district and the heart out of every run-holder.
Sometimes the one was in fault, and sometimes
the other; oftenest, both were in error. And thus,
whether the Riverine sky smiled with exquisite
delicacy of blue tint, or frowned with its occa-
sional sullenness, or glared brassily, the men who
worked and schemed beneath it were driven by
the iniquity and folly of the politicians to range
themselves in one of two opposing armies, and to
spend their energies in cutting one another’s
throats, instead of combining in the eminently
useful work of cutting the throats of the legisla-
tors.
It was nothing but natural that some persons
and things quite innocent of partisanship should
get mixed up involuntarily with these class-battles
and animosities. Bankers, tradesmen, and clergy-
men, with every wish and interest to remain inde-
pendent of both sides, became entangled with one
or the other or both. So, too, the boat-owner,
who earned big lump freights from the squatter for
wool and stores, but who made also big profits on
his own tradings with the selectors and tradesmen.
Even the Government officials took sides.
But of all the men and things and institutions
that, having no immediate relation to the adver-
saries in the great battle of Free Selection versus
Squatterdom, yet became involved with the for-
tunes of the fray, the most singular item was the
corpse of Dictionary Ned.* And the story of the
way it did so is also an illustration of the
lack of honour in the achievement of one’s ends
which widely characterised the Riverine men of
the period. The trick by which Ned’s corpse
enabled the race between the Currency Lass and
the Pride of the Darling to be won by the former
was, in one aspect, justifiable. But certainly, in
several others, the reverse. And this is a case
where the predominant qualities give the tone to
the whole proceeding.
# # #
Dictionary Ned, dying in Hay hospital,
had desired with his latest words to be cremated,
or, as he termed it, “incinerated.” “Cremate”
or “cremation” were not in his dictionary;
“incinerate” and “incineration” were. In this
epoch of the Early Seventies, when the disposal of
the dead by burning was mooted, the latter terms
were as often used as the former, but both expres-
sions were as novelties, and the thing expressed
was more novel still. Accordingly, when poor old
Dictionary had “ gone inside,” the Riverine
Grazier, of Hay, and the Riverine Herald, of
Echuca, each put forth a claim for the honour and
distinction of burning Ned. Also—for the profit.
Ned was known on the rivers—well and favour-
ably known, and nobody in the flush times of the
Riverine thought anything of travelling a hundred
miles to do respect to a dead acquaintance. In
ordinary circumstances, Ned would have had a
glorious funeral, and the local publican a rousing
time, but when his obsequies were to comprise no
ordinary hearse and ostrich-feather business, but
the genuine novelty of a cremation, there was
every reason to look for an inrush of visitors,
intense grief, and deep drinking. Consequently,
each of the patriotic and bibulous editors of the
two influential papers named demanded that Ned
should be finally disposed of in his own “ impor-
tant and leading centre.”
» # #
Echuca won the point—not, it is to be sus-
pected, by any superiority of logic on the part of
its editor, or of body in its local brew, but owing
to the fact that Boyd, the Echuca bank manager,
was in possession of Ned’s funds. He wired Mr.
Grundy, forwarding agent at Hay, to “ Send Ned
along by first boat. Dispose of him here.” Mr.
Boyd’s word in this particular case was law. It
was often law in others, too —and deuced expen-
sive law at that.
Ned, you may remember, was bargeman on the
Royal Duke, the barge of the Currency Lass
steamer. And as the Lass and the Duke were
topping up with back clips at Pollard’s Wharf, at
the time Boyd’s wire came to hand, it was the
easiest thing in the world to slip Ned in his coffin
aboard the craft to which he had been attached.
As they dropped down into the mid-stream the
hands from the other boats in port joined the
loafers and lumpers on the wharves and cheered.
Every person of standing above the average
departing by coach or steamer was sped by a
cheer from the Hay people of that time. A
prisoner going to Deniliquin to be tried and
hanged, and the judge who would sentence him, a
newly-married couple or, as now, a corpse—it was
all one to Hay. How the cheers would spring forth
—and the throats would get dry and dusty and be
washed out. Disappointed as Hay was at losing
the chance of seeing curious, prosaic old Ned
transformed by fire into a poetic white salt, it
would not refuse him the farewell as he lay in his
shell under the tarpaulin aft in the barge. The
sight of that elongated object was touching—and
a splendid excuse for a drink. Hay folk always
disliked drinking for its own sake. They appreci-
ated an excuse.
Between Hay and Nap-Nap the trip of the Lass
and her barge was uneventful. Somehow every-
one on board had expected something to happen.
It was no unusual thing to pick up a coffin at a
wayside landing for transport to the nearest town-
ship or Melbourne, but there was, when the crew
came to think about it, something eerie and
peculiar in the notion of carrying a stiff ’un to be
burnt. And the river men were almost as super-
stitious as sailors.
Without the same reason for hating to have a
parson on board that Jack at sea has, a boat-hand
grew morose when a white-choker was seen among
the passengers though there was no albatross to
daunt him as it poised itself on “a magnificent
length of tremulous pinion,” to entrance him
with malign glance, there were land-birds
which infected him with their mystery ; and
if the mermaid did not spring from the
water to lure him to ruin, still the yellow
wave was alive with weird creatures whose mur-
murs could be heard in the still night when the
boats were tied up, and the moonlight splintered
through the gums and acacias on the banks. And
so the nervous-system of the Lass’s crew was
shaken severely by the knowledge of their defunct
passenger’s destination. “’Tis a-temptin’ the
Arl-maaghty, that it be,” said Cornish Jim, the
Methodist fireman who would sing Wesley’s hymns
in a sweet tenor in the intervals of blasphemy.
“I do b’lieve as they maaght ha’ wa’ted a bit an’
so he be warnted to be buirnt, don’t ’ee think ?
’Twarn’t as if Satan udn’t do it in arl good time!”
And Jim spoke in all seriousness the sentiments
of all. Nevertheless, M’Farlane’s Nap-Nap was
reached without incident. At M'Farlane’s, the
Lass found the Pride of the Darling taking in
wool and passengers. Though owned by different
men, they were twin boats from the same yard,
built on the same model, with equal engine-power,
but, owing to the Pride having been generally
worked on the Darling, while the Lass was a
Murray and Murrumbidgee boat, they had never
been matched in a trial of speed. And it was a
problem on the rivers which was the better boat.
The general impression was that they were much
of a muchness, and that any test of superiority
would really be decided by the qualities of their
skippers.
• # •
The Currency Lass was commanded by
Ted Gowan—one of the early-time chaps who had
risen from the position of an ordinary deck-hand ;
while the Pride was skippered by one of the big
firm’s newer importations. Forrester was a decent
fellow enough, and ready to adjust himself to the
river conditions. He was, however, like so many
new chums, too much disposed to toady to mere
wealth, and the “big-frontage man” was to him
an object of reverence, quite irrespective of the
consideration as to whether the fellow he made
much of was anything more than the nominee of
a bank, or was in the least degree admirable
regarded simply as a man. Consequently, he was
“just the sort” to tumble into all sorts of pit-
falls on the rivers in an epoch of transition. In
the disputes between squatters and selectors he
could not help taking sides, while grim old stagers
like Davies, and Dorward, and Lewin steered
right ahead, and let the troubled waters close up
after them as best they could.
As the Lass steamed by the Nap-Nap landing,
she was gladly hailed by Dick Pillar, mate of the
Pride, who was hungry for a tussle.
“ Hello, the Lass ! In a hurry, Ted ?” he called.
“ Can’t yer wait for us at the town, and we’ll race
yer up to ’Chuca ?”
“How long’ll you be, Dick?” Gowan said, as
he slowed down. “ I’ll go slow if you won’t be
long. ”
“ We’ve another score of bales an’ the fadges to
stow, an’ then to trim her. We’ll be arter yer in
a hour. ”
“Right you are then. I’ll wait at Cramsie’s
an’ fix up terms. I’m on for a spin if your skipper
is 1”
And then Dick bethought himself. Perhaps
the new-chum cove wouldn’t be willing to give up
command to him, Dick, as it was essential he
should for a race on equal conditions. To pit
Forrester against Gowan was to lose the contest
at once, before the start. Gowan could wriggle
his boat and barge across “wet grass ” without
the thrilling of a nerve, but Forrester was
desperately afraid of the shifting stream and its
mysteriously changing currents and snags and
sandspits. Would Forrester consent ?
Dick put the question before his skipper. He
urged how the rivers had always wanted a fair
heel and toe race between the sister craft, and
here was a quite unusual chance to oblige ’em—
loading about the same—next to no passengers to
kick up a fuss when the pressure gauge was getting
suspiciously high—fair weather—and the race
would be over before the bosses (owners) would
know anything about it. The bosses did not
object to racing per se, but they, had, in view of
the risk thereto attaching, a repugnance to rapid
night runs, and it was, of course, a prime con-
dition of a contest that there should be no
stoppages.
Forrester was dubious. He was not certain, he
said, how the bosses would take the thing at all;
win or lose. And—he hinted though he did not
say—that Gowan knew the stream ever sa much
better than he did.
“ Oh, the bosses won’t say nothin’ when it’s all
over,” urged Dick. “It’s the knowin’ of it in
advance they can’t get over, for it shakes up the
insurance people a bit. An’ as to runnin’, why,
sir, I’ll stick at the wheel till I drop jest to have a
show of puttin’ ol’ Ted Gowan down.”
Forrester was aft when Pillar had approached
him, talking to a passenger, just come on board
from the station homestead. This man, the Hon.
Samuel Darke, M.L.O. (Victoria), was a well-
known figure in every spot familiar to Riverine
men. Half Irish, half Scotch, he was tall as one
of the first breed of Hawkesbury Cornstalks, and
strong with the strength of the brute. His intel-
ligence, though it smacked of the brute, too, as it
was more cunning and instinct than reason, had
carried him upward from the duffing-yard of the
Manaro gully-raker to the proud position of a
frontage shark in Riverina, who was spoken of
with admiration at Scott’s in Melbourne, and
Esplin’s in Hay, and Petty’s in Sydney. Why the
heavy jowl, the eyes that wouldn’t look straight,
the coarse ridge of fleshy nose, and the overhang-
ing brow had not hanged him before the gully-
raker had merged into the “ honest squatter ” and
influential legislator suggested questions as to the
peccability, in the way of bribes, of the rural
police. He was one of the chieftains of the moneyed
host who had sworn by their altars to beat and
bounce the “cookie” out of Riverina, and was
altogether so great a man that the British-born

soul of Captain Forrester worshipped him im-
mensely. Was he not the favoured of the princi-
pal of the Britisher’s gods, Success?
Now, Darke had overheard Dick’s appeal to his
skipper, and conscious, of his supremacy, inter-
fered unasked.
“ No racin’ while I’m a-board, skipper ! Ye
don’t come that game wi’ me! ”
“ No, oh no, of course not, sir.” And Forrester,
forgetting he was no longer an apprentice in an
ocean liner, addressing his omnipotent captain,
touched his cap.
“ An’ I’m damned if I don’t get the marks of
that other fellow’s wool! If he carries clips of
any of my friends I’ll take care he gets a fine
rap over the knuckles.”
“ Yes, sir—just so—Mr. Darke ! That’s what
I feel, sir. ’Tisn’t fair to consignors to run risks !”
Then, turning to Pillar, he said, “No, mate!
Can’t think of racing ! ”
So Dick retired for’ard.
As he passed the engine-room he spoke dis-
gustedly to the engineer. “My colonial oath !
Hanged if I don’t start a bloomin’ subscription to
buy th’ old man a soot of plush an’ false calves.”
“ What’s he been adoin’ of, Dick ? ”
“A-touchin’ of his cap to that Darke!
Wot’s th’ rivers a-oomin’ to when a full-blown
skipper does th’ flunkey to an old cattle-duffer ?
Th’ rivers is a-goin’ to th’ devil, an’ no mistake.”
# * •
This was ab Nap-Nap landing. When,
however, the Pride had covered the 30 miles or so
to Balranald, an alteration in the resolution of her
skipper and passenger was effected with unex-
pected ease. A company of young fellows from
the Heytesbury country in Western Victoria had
just selected on Oanally and neighbouring stations,
and some of their number were on their way to
Echuca to shift down their stores and waggons.
They had booked as deck passengers by the Lass,
and were all impatience for the arrival of the
other boat in order that the race might be entered
upon.
Gowan, whose craft’s steam was up, wood in,
and passengers aboard, sprang from Cramsie’s
stage to the Pride’s deck, as the latter slowed in
to take up a small lot of hides. “ Well, Forrester,”
he said, “ what d’you say ? Are you on to make
a match of it? First through ’Chuca punt—losers
to give winners a spread at Jimmy Irons’s ?”
“ No,” said Forrester, shortly. “ I’m not on! ”
“Phew, you’re not, ain’t you? What the
dickens did you mean then by patting Dick
Pillar up to ask me? Have you grown funkey on
it?”
“No, I haven’t. But business is business—
and our owners don’t pay us to run races and
risks at the same time.”
“ Our owners ! Speak for your own, my boy,”
retorted Gowan, nettled. “I’ll speak for mine
who trusts to my judgment and doesn’t keep me
in leading strings like some other coves have got
their skippers ! ” Then he turned to go. As he
did so, he caught sight of the Honorable Sam
Darke.
“ Good day, Mr. Darke. ’Ope yer well! I
want Forrester here to race us to ’Chuca, but he
isn’t game.”
“ I’ll take care he ain’t game !” said the M.L.C.,
with characteristic coarseness of tone.
“Well,” rejoined Gowan, annoyed, “My
passengers, though they’re only selectors, ain’t
afraid of a bit of a flutter.”
“ Oh, oh, you’re carryin’ some of those
blackmailin’ beauties, are you ?”
“I don’t know nothin’ about blackmailin’, an’
as they ain’t M.P.’s on the land racket, I don’t
think as they does either !” shouted Gowan, as he
was crossing the gang-plank.-
“ Damn you ! I’ll make you pay for that sooner
or later !” exclaimed Darke, furious, as all his class
were, at insinuations referring to their well-known
land-sharking methods.
“ Oh, keep your hair on, Mr. Darke!” replied
Gowan, “an’ if you want to make me pay, back
that bloomin’ Pride in a match with me to ’Chuca,
and she’s bound to win, y’know, when she’s
you aboard. You bring good luck wherever you
go, don’t ye ! —’specially to the cookies an’ dummy
crowds!”
Darke, irritated at these words, discovered a
perception of a way in which he could take down
this impertinent skipper. He turned to Forrester,
whose notions of propriety were being grievously
shocked by the language of his brother skipper,
and said, “Forrester, are yer in racin’ trim?”
“ Well—yes—sir, if you really wish it.”
; Darke, without answering, called to Gowan,
“ Look’ere, you cheeky dog, if your black-
mailers ’ll back you to a ’underd, money down, I
lay two to one on th’ Pride 1”
And while his challenge was exciting a sensa-
tion among the passengers and crew of the other
boat he chuckled himself into good humour by the
consideration that he’d got ’em there. He’d risk
“ two’underd wi’ pleasure, seein’ as’ow th’loss
of a ’underd would break the .” This was an
occasion when his old-time bullockese was of dis-
tinct value as a mode of expression.
• • •
After a hasty conference the challenge
was accepted by the Currency Lass party. While
the crews of both boats eagerly wooded up for the
fray, so as to avoid needless stoppages, a stake-
holder was appointed. A colonial experiencer,
returning full up of his experience to Melbourne,
en route for his mother's Kensington drawing-
room, offered his services, but was treated with
scorn by both parties. They applied to him with
unnecessary indelicacy of phrase, the old query—
“ Who shall guard the guardians ?” Peter Camp-
bell, bush missionary, also on his way to Mel-
bourne for a mild dissipation after a fairly success-
ful journey among the Edward and Wakool
stations, was also repudiated. Peter was well-
known, “and they didn’t like to throw tempta-
tion in his way.” And, finally, Cramsie’s
manager being appointed with instructions to
wire the amount to the firm’s Echuca agency to
be claimed by the winner, the stakes were lodged.
Of a composite nature they were ! “ Cash-
orders ” on the shipping firms and stations were
the main currency of the rivers, and the stakes
held a superb variety of autographs of more or less
financial solidity. Even the Legislative Coun-
cillor, who never travelled without gold—gold
payments to dummies and their kin could not be
traced !—took advantage of the opportunity to
free his pocket-book of orders.
And then the conditions were drawn up on two
halves of a sheet of notepaper
The stakes to be lodged with Cramsie’s manager
—<£2oo on the Pride’s behalf ; .£lOO on behalf of
the Lass.
Each boat to have a representative on the other.
Day and night running.
First through the punt at Echuca.
The boats to start from the foot of Yura-
nigh-street, called after Sir Thomas Mitchell’s
famous black Yuranigh (whose grave enclosure
was for some time used by a distinguished legis-
lator as a cowrbale). No warping over pinches
and shallows. Fair heel and toe work all through.
Fuel, cord for cord, taken in at Balranald, and
no stoppage for refilling at wood-piles permitted.
And—f uel not supplemented from cargo.
Last in the schedule of conditions, this proviso
might, not improbably, prove the moat important.
Races had taken place in which an unscrupulous
skipper had used consignees’ casks of tallow as
stoking material for a furnace, paying for the same
out of the stakes thus illegitimately won.
* * m
They started from the crazy timber thing
called the wharf, after a three hours’ spell devoted
by all hands on the two boats to adjusting top
hamper, getting clean furnaces, trimming the
barges. Opposite Yuranigh-street they shut off
steam, and waited till Cramsie’s manager passed a
measuring-rod over the stacked cords of wood.
The Lass’s stock was, if anything, under that
of the Pride. With much greatness of soul, the
Legislative Councillor consented to a dozen sticks
of firewood being shoved over to the Lass.
Then a brawny young blacksmith from the
Camperdown country, Victoria, was dropped on
the Pride as representative of the Lass, and the
Lass received Peter Campbell, selected by Darke,
to watch over the interests of the Pride on her
rival. Peter’s main spiritual—and spirituous—
sustenance came from the squatters’ class. Hence
Darke felt he was safe with Peter.
And then, at the best available substitute for
a pistol-shot—a reverberant cracking of Gory
Sam from Tanga’s stockwhip—and amid a roar
of cheers, a full head of steam was put on. With
a crash and a splash and a rattle, they ran off
level. If the start meant, any thing, it should be
a well-matched race.
# # #
A wire from Balranald had acquainted the
Swan Hillites with the intelligence that, at last,
the twin boats were “at it.” And, as they rolled
by it with a duck-like skimming—they were almost
level—the people clustered on the banks at the
crossing township shouted hints as to the state
of the rivers, which might have been valuable if
only they had been understood. And —but why
particularise all points? Now one was ahead a
tow-rope’s length, and now the other ; each was
greatly handled, and each answered to her builder’s
fame.
But, nearing Gunbower, they set down for the
final struggle. Dick Pillar —Forrester was wise
enough to give up the wheel and do the mate’s
work—and Gowan were sleepless, and yet each
was fresher, so it seemed to their backers, than
when the crafts left Balranald.
At Gunbower, the Lass hung up for a couple of
hours to cool her bearings for the final run in.
Pillar would have done the same, but he was over-
ruled by Darke, M.L.O. There are problems in
applied mechanics that even the massive intellect
of a Legislative Councillor cannot solve. Darke
could not apprehend the impossibility of running
incessantly with heated plummer-blocks, and how
he chuckled and chuckled as the sound of the
Lass’s exhaust grew fainter and fainter, and utterly
faded into silence. “He would give those—
(bullockese) —selectors somethink to remember him
by !” he swore.
But ten miles beyond Gunbower a dreadful
message was communicated to him. The wood
had given out! Overnight, the stock had been
drawn upon hugely, and now, in the blossoming
dawn, it was known that the fuel on hand would
not suffice for two hours’ full running.
Heavens, how he effervesced with eloquent
bulloeky talk! He swore he would stoke the
furnace with the (bullockese) carcases of the (more
bullockese) deck-hands! “I’ll be hanged if you
will!” quoth Camperdown’s son of Vulcan.
“ Deck-hands ain’t wooden, you see, Mr. Darke—
not being Members of Parliament, sir !”
Then he would have had the men’s bunks and
the cabin fittings broken up for fuel, “No, you
don’t!” persisted the Oamperdonian. “Not if I
knows it!” And the Honourable the Legislative
Councillor was beaten again.
But one gleam of hope had he. The Lass must
be almost in the same plight. And of fulfilment
of this he was not deprived, for when, sometime
after the swift gliding of the Pride had given place
to a subdued and pulseless motion that was almost
retrogressive, she was gradually overhauled by
the Lass, it was noticed that she, too, was running
at less than half-speed.
As the Lass drew near to the Pride, Peter
Campbell, missioner to the back blocks, waddled
for’ard and shouted. The words were no sooner
out of his mouth than—-it hurts us to havl to
relate so painful an incident —the closed fist of a
sturdy child of the forest struck Peter’s saintly
paunch and doubled him up. “Shut up, you old
fraud, you ! If we’re out of firewood, that’s our
look-out, not theirs !’’ It would have been some
consolation to Peter, as he revolved in much
inconvenience for some moments, could he but
have been sure that his words had reached the
Honourable Samuel Darke’s ears. As it hap-
pened, they did ; and Darke and his sympathisers
took heart of grace thereby. The Lass’s people
must be in equal trouble with themselves.
# * #
Unfortunately for Darke’s two hundred,
the distress of the Lass was, however, not quite
so extreme as the Pride’s. The Lass had some-
thing in reserve.
By slow puffings and feeble paddlings which
were ever on the verge of ceasing to propel the
crafts a foot further in their course, the two
steamers had reached the bend which leads into
the reach by Echuca park. Twenty minutes’ fair
steaming would see them at the pontoons of the
floating-bridge, but how on earth were they to
reach the punt ?
If, during the rapid running, the excitement on
the boats mounted with the steam gauge, there
was, as might have been expected, no drooping of
the enthusiasm as the steam power grew weaker
and weaker. Progress, since Gunbower Mills were
passed, was decidedly of an ironical sort, and, had
the river been flowing with a masterful flood
current, it is quite conceivable that the race would
have been declared off from sheer inability to
complete the last ten miles of their course. It
was, however, sluggish, and the crafts managed,
with laborious strainings, to make headway
till entering the long park reach. Then
even Dai’ke considered the contest no longer
worth fighting. Between the stern post of
the Pride’s barge and the nose of the Lass there
was a good 40 yards. It was evidently hopeless
for the' Lass to conquer even that paltry distance
and come level. Morally, if not by the precise

conditions of the match, the race was won by the
Pride.
He was saying as much to Forrester and Pillar,
when a solid volume of murky cloud burst from
the Lass’s smoke-stack, and with increased firing
the Lass and her barge shot forward suddenly.
“ H !” cried Darke. “ They’ve been gullin’
us !” And then he became too maddened to
indulge even in the unqualified vocabulary of the
gully-raker and puncher.
As for Pillar and Forrester, they confessed the
game was up. But how the devil did Gowan
manage it? Had he burnt his boat’s fittings?
That was unlikely! He had no rich squatter
aboard to stand the damage. Then, how had he
managed ? Had he not been running fair, but
had surreptitiously obtained fuel ?
The way of it they learnt from that reverend
sufferer, Peter Campbell. As the Lass rushed
past them, they could just grasp his words over
the derisive cheering of the victorious party:
“ Mister Darke, mon, they’re boomin’ the
corpse!”
» # *
It was even so. Dictionary Ned, by a
happy thought of Gowan’s, was granted his in-
cineration ; somewhat prematurely, perhaps, but
on the final judgment of the river-men when the
subject was debated later, in the way he would
hafe most preferred. And he raised just steam
enough to force the Lass and her consort, the
Duke, through the pontoons.
Darke, at first, protested against the stakes
being paid over. “ Cargo was barred ! ” he splut-
tered. “Damn it! if it came to firin’ up with
cargo, I’d have shoved in half-a-dozen bales of
wool ! ”
“ Dictionary Ned wasn’t cargo ! ” contended
Gowan. “ There isn’t a boat on the rivers as
would take poor old Ned as cargo, except Locky
M'Bean’s Goldsb’rough ! ”
“ What in would ye call him, then?” roared
Darke.
“ Why, an honorary passenger, sir, o’ course !”
retorted Gowan.
The popular verdict, and the stakeholders’, went
with Gowan. And, thereupon, there was the
most royal of sprees at the old Bridge, at which
the memory of Dictionary Ned was toasted in the
most solemn and impressive of silences.
It was Cornish Jim who set the ballot talk
rolling once more. “P’r’ps,” he said, “Th’
Arlmaiighty do know Ts business best aiifter arl!”
Jim was like most men. He approved of the
Almighty’s dealings with him, when he was on
the winning side.
Freedom of contract : freedom of contact
—with coloured races.
Genius is sometimes hereditary. Conan
Doyle’s father was the famous “ Dicky ” Doyle,
of London Punch —(in its good days) —and his
grandfather was the “ H.B. ”of pre-Victorian and
early Victorian celebrity.
They say dead-beats have worked passages
from Adelaide to West Australia merely by nick-
ing up fancy dogs and taking them aboard. The
ship was cft route for Zanzibar, where good dogs,
especially greyhounds, are at a premium.
An article in the World (Eng.) on Dr.
Conan Doyle mentions him, Smollett and Lever
as the instances of the connection between the
medical profession and the writing of romances.
What has become of Oliver Goldsmith? Does
the prejudice against “foreign degrees” go back
so far as that? Or is it now decided by the New
Criticism that the “Vicar of Wakefield” is not
romance ?
West Australians have started to complete
the harbour at Fremantle —mainly so as to be
able to shut up a Yankee skipper who waxed
sarcastic. “Call that a harbour,” he yelled,
“ call that a harbour ! I reckon I’d make as good
a harbour as that with seven tandstickor matches
and a pint o’ beer. You stick a few piles in the
Indian Ocean, you protect them by the Cape of
Good Hope. Then you have the cheek to get up
and call the thing a harbour.”
An attempt has been made to steal Jay
Gould’s carcase, for purposes of ransom, and his
sepulchre is now guarded day and night by armed
men. The best way to protect the dead miser is
for the heirs to notify that anybody can have
Gould’s remains by coming for them, and can
keep them when he has got them. Whenever a
rich American dies now, some body-snatcher
immediately comes after his dust, and the way to
extinguish the industry is to let him have it.
“ Another way ” would be cremation.
The Bishop of Winchester, in a recent
pastoral letter dated from Farnham Castle,
remarks : —“ I wish you to understand —some of
you may feel a difficulty in understanding it,
loyal Churchmen though you be —why it is that it
seems a duty to live here If I could
not have lived in modest dignity at Farnham I
might have shrunk from coming to you at all.”
There are just sixty four rooms at Farnham, not
counting kitchens, servants’ apartments and
offices, fourteen flights of stairs, thirty-nine
chimneys, also stained-glass windows and about
an acre of roof. There is nearly a mile of stair
and hall carpet in the place, and it costs =£2so a
year to keep up the red deer in the park.
“Modest dignity ” is a good way to express this
pastoral simplicty.
An English court has just decided that no
action can be taken in the case of a man who
shouted slanderous and disgusting language to a
lady across the river Lea, because the abuse was
composed in one county and received in another,
therefore neither county has jurisdiction. How
would this apply in the case of a man standing
just over the Queensland border who shot or threw
bricks at another man in N.S. Wales, with fatal
results ? The N.S. Wales courts, as far as we see,
could take no cognisance of the man, because he
was in Queensland when the crime was committed,
and the Queensland courts could take no cogni-
sance of the corpse, for it was hit in N.S.W. This
theory is based, of course, on the assumption that
a crime dates from the place the brick starts from
—not from the place it stops at. Or supposing a
man standing just inside the border hit another on
the head with a stick, and the latter fell back
across the frontier and expired. If he was alive
when he left Queensland, how would the fact that
he afterwards died in N.S. Wales affect the case r j*

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWOKTH FAILS.
THIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10J Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
. When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may' be safely described as
The Madeira of the Blue Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the ’mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.
The vvaratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Fails in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
' Hie charming Estate of Fontainebleau !
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be' without exception the finest
Carnage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and,the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.

once, as they are likely' to largely' advance in value. The
