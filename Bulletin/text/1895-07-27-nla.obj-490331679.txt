CONCERNING ENGLISH
CRITICS.
English literary criticism often seems to Aus-
tralians singularly bad. For one thing, it is
coloured by the loves and jealousies of literary
Cliques. Hath not one of their own writers re-
cently said that-“the bardlets of the Bodloy Head
sit in a row, and have pomatum rubbed into their
heads, week after week, by the assiduous Mr. Le
Gallienne, who will presently skip up beside them
again and expect to have pomatum rubbed into
him ” ? The Le Gallienne coterie makes a good
Jeal of current-literature criticism for the Daily
Chronicle and Weekly Sun —if that can be
called criticism which is mainly a chorus of un-
diseriminating praise. T. P. O’Connor’s criticism
in the Son is a bolus of long extracts washed down
with superficial epithets. The Literary World
Is weak and commonplace. The Bookman is
good, as far as it goes ; and the Academy is also
good, though tame. The ablest English literary
criticism, generally speaking, is found in the
Athen/EUM and the Saturday Review the
former being more thorough, the latter brighter.
Quiller-Couch, in the Speaker, is a good taster
and chronicler, but hardly a good critic. The
Spectator would be good if it could get rid of its
“ respectable ” bias ; the National Observer
runs too much to smartness and flippancy.
As an example of biased English criticism, take
the comments in the National Observer and the
Spectator on William Watson’s recently-pub-
lished “Hymn to the Sea." The former journal
sums-up the poem in two lines as “a long jingle-
jangle ” in “ metre both imitative and mono-
tonous.” The latter can hardly praise it enough in
two columns, and concludes by saying that “in
this noble poem, mistermed a hymn, but all the
more wonderful for the purely imaginative char-
acter of its splendor, we are greatly mistaken if
all competent critics will not recognise at last that
we have amongst us another of the really greatest
masters of English song.” Now, the truth, to an
Australian mind, seems to lie about midway
between these extremes of blame and praise.
And the Australian mind is so peculiarly-situated
that its judgments in such a matter are much more
likely to be sound than those penned in the heated
literary atmosphere of London. For its attitude
is impersonal, almost incurious ; it has the same
high standards to refer to ; and the dividing sea
lias almost the force of dividing time, and helps to
lift its dicta above the mists of contemporary
prejudice, into the clear upper-air which
strengthens and refines the verdict of posterity.
As examples of incompetent English criticism,
take almost every word penned regarding tales by
English authors with an Australia milieu —and
there is no English author so poor nowadays that ho
oannot sport a bushranger or a sundowner. Here
critics and authors generally browse in the same
fields of ignorance, with results satisfactory to
both classes. The Saturday Review, for in-
stance, says of one of Marriott Watson’s recently-
miblished stories, “The Last of
“ an Australian bush-ranger,” that it “would be a
striking story anywhere.” Anywhere—but in
Australia, where its exotic unreality kills it at
once. A bushranger sticks up a station. The
family are at evening dinner ; and “ beef or mut-
ton or pork ” are mentioned as their “ three
staples.” An English jackeroo has his meals with
the squatter, and is referred to by the writer (and
the bushranger) as “the cadet.” The squatter
resides on the station, and his manager. The
mutton is “half-bred Leicester.” The bush-
ranger enters and says all the hands are “ in a
corral.” “A station-hand, hot and dusty with
travel, broke into the room ” while dinner was
proceeding—as is apparently the habit of station-
hands. The bushranger takes the squatter’s arm
with one hand, and the manager’s with the other,
and marches them out to the stables. He is alotie
at the time ; both his hands are occupied ; and
they submit! The bushranger fires twice (joint-
blank without doing any harm ; and eventually he
and a mate are shot—thanks mostly to “the
cadet ” (of course). And so on. Perhaps one or
two of these things would pass singly; but
together, to an Australian eye, they make the tale
ridiculous.
But the Saturday Reviewer doesn’t know that.
RECENT PUBLICATIONS.
Ohas. H. Barton, author of “Outlines of Aus-
tralian Physiography ” (cloth, 3s 6d), is a well-
known Maryborough (Q.) identity; and what he
does is done thoroughly. His old-time leading-
articles in the Chronicle scorned to make any-
thing less than three or four 22-inch full news
■olumns. One in particular, discussing the ques-
tion of a bridge over the Burrum, or the Isis, or
some such trumpery little Northern creek, was the
awe of surrounding journalists. It started with
an historical exordium which referred to the
ancient stone bridges of China, Xerxes’ bridge of
boats, across the Hellespont, and Trajan’s big
bridge across the Danube, and gradually mean-
dered down the centuries past the Menai suspen-
sion, the Brooklyn, and the Tay, until it reached
r he Burrum bridge by very easy stages and urged
that tli" Govt., with all these noble examples
before them, should be urged to hand over £250
at once. The absolute accuracy of these details is
not guaranteed, but the impression of tremendous
learning was fix and on the reader’s mind in some
such fashion and 4i columns. Mr. Barton has
attacked Australian physiography with com-
parative brevity, but no less determination. His
book comprises th<> substance of a course of
University Extension lectures delivered last
year. He treats of the general configuration
-and hydrography of Australia ; of the climate ; of
hypsometrical and geological features ; of fauna
and flora ; and of the aborigines. His work has
chief value as an educational handbook ; its attrac-
tion for the general leader is slight. The style is
lucid, but not luminous ; the subject is treated
rather ponderously than picturesquely. The book
is admirable as an aid to study, but lacks interest
as an aid to popular information. This is not
meant as blame, but merely as admeasurement of
praise ; for Mr. Barton’s “ Outlines” can be cordi-
ally commended to Australians with intelligence
enough to appreciate them : the regret is only that
so many are unfitted to appreciate them —if a
deduction from the sales of piratical literature and
“ comic scraps ” has any value. An extract from
Mr. Barton’s most imaginative section —that
which deals with “The Aborigines”—would give
an idea of his best manner : elsewhere he is too
heavily-burdened with facts. But space is want-
ing, and the book should be bought. Only one
misprint is noted: “J. L. Jack” for “R. L.
Jack ” on p. 38.
The first number of Stead’s “ Penny Poets ”
series is to hand: “Macaulay’s Poems” (3d.).
It is a very cheap and creditable production,
though not so “ unique ” as Mr. Fitchett
thinks; for Dick’s penny series contains
many English classics, “ Merrie England ”
is a larger pennyworth than the “Lays,” and
Cassell and other publishers have done a good deal
with penny numbers. And these had not the
advantage of Stead’s mastery of reclame.
“ The Knife that Killed Po Haney ” is the title
of another set of Frank Stockton’s short stories
(cloth, 45.). They are cleverly done, but too
bloodless to interest much; and the humor of
“Rudder Grange ” is now attenuated to vanishing
point.
“The Avenger of Blood,” by J. Maclaren
Cobban (cloth, 45.), is a boys’ book of moderate
interest only.
More trash is published in Macmillan’s Colonial
Library than in any other of the series with which
Australia is favored. Books like “ Alice Lauder,”
and “The Burden of a Woman” belong to a
dull, commonplace type possibly interesting
to a very low-calibre intellect; but, in any
case, time is wasted in reading them when good
authors are so cheap and numerous, “ Thirteen
Doctors,” by Mrs. J. K. Spender—a series of
medical tales—is little better; and comparison
with “Round the Red Lamp” is inevitable and
disastrous. Frankfort Moore’s “Two in the
Bush ” is a collection of short stories which show
talent and are worth looking at, though the author
has done much better work. “ Two in the Bush,”
by-the-bye, is another injustice to Australia. It
is a bad English shot that can’t hit Australia.
“ Under God’s Sky,” is a provincial English char-
acter novel which calls for no enthusiasm.
George R. Parkin’s “Great Dominion ” is a series of
papers on Canadian commercial aspects, readable
and informing, and worth purchase by anyone
interested in the Canada of to-day. (The above,
each —paper, 2s. lOd. ; cloth, 3s. 10d.).
“Tales of Mean Streets,” by Arthur Morrison
(paper, 35.; cloth, 45.), has been very highly
praised in England. It is a series of stories and
sketches illustrating London East-End life, un-
doubtedly very strong, though the merit is rather
that of exceedingly clever journalism tiian of
literature, A book to buy.
NOTES.
Australians have much to be thankful for in
the matter of cheap books. In Bell’s, Macmil-
lan’s, Longmans’, Heinemann’s, Cassell’s, and
Methuen’s libraries we get the best new fiction at
about half the English price. Certainly, the
three-volume tradition has been ended summarily,
but English readers have often to pay Gs. for the
book which we have for 2s. >d. or 3s. fid. Dis-
count, indeed, lowers the over-sea price to 4s. Gd. :
but the growing fashion of net prices is seriously
weakening this pleasant custom of Paternoster
Row. Of course Australia pays the publishers for
her privileges ; for here nearly everyone has been
educated by the State into book-buying, and the
vogue of the circulating library is comparatively
small. To an Australian wholesale buyer said an
English publisher the other day: “ You have a
four-million population; but you buy, on the
English scale, books enough for ten millions.”
Mrs. Caffyn’s profits from “A Yellow Aster”
are set (on the best authority) at from .£120" to
<£ls'io. The publishers hardly expect to make
.£IOOO. The total sale of all editions to the end of
June was about 3 ,01) > copies— not so many, con-
sidering that the book was the rage of last London
season. The new and cheaper edition (45.) is
not selling well—the glory hath departed.
Australian booksellers have booked a large
number of orders for “ Trilby’’—wholly on the
strength of the English and American vogue.
Yet the book is rather dull than otherwise; and
the spicy Whistler passages which appeared in
Harper’s edition are cut out. For Du Maurier’s
“ Peter Ibbetson ” —quite as good, or bad—there
is no demand at all. And “ Trilby ” herself, mar-
vellous feet and all, is so long in reaching the Aus-
tralian public that when she does come nobody
will care, or even pretend to care, very much about
her.
Alleged Scotch “ wut ” is always sure of a
patriotic audience, and “lan Maclaren,” author
of “ Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush,” has no reason
to complain of the popular reception which has
welcomed his indubitable geese as swans of the
finest feather. A nation which can regard Burns’
Letters to Clarinda and Cos. as models of epistolary
English is capable of any literary aberration. But
“lan Maclaren,’’according to Douglas Sladen, who
reports his speech to an audience of authors, seems
to have more humor on his tongue than on his pen.
He said his boy came home from a public-school
and complained of being called “A Young
Pseudonym.” “If you are going to write books,
why can’t you write like this. Bee, this book is
something like. Here is a ghost, that’s all right;
there is a cliff and eagle’s eggs; there’s nothing
like that in yours. Here’s a big book swimming
with blood. See the number of people who have
to die. If you could write a thing like that I’d
read it myself, and I’d lend it to fellows in other
houses as well.”
Zola on Universities ; —“ Whoever has breathed
the air of such a school remains infected by it as;
long as he lives. The stale and sickly odour of
dead and useless learning clings to his very brain,
and in spite of all his efforts he goes through life
itching with petty jealousies and a pedagogue’s
love of the rod, and embittered with all the hatred
and envy of the old bachelor who had never had
courage enough to claim the woman he loved.
When such a fellow happens to be quick and bold
by nature, an innovator with new ideas, which is
not often the ease, he spends such time and labor
in giving his thoughts an academic and conven-
tional air, that we pass his discovery by as an
antiquated formula. He cannot be original if he
would ; he has lived top long in the mould ; his
being has taken the shape imposed upon it. You
may sow scholars and reap professors, but never
will you find an original, creative intelligence
among them pawns, pawns, nothing but
pawns.”
Angus and Robertson have arranged with
Henry Lawson to bring out a choice edition of his
works in two vols., prose and verse, at ss. each ;
posted, ss. Gd. Mrs. Louisa Lawson’s Is. edition
was exhausted some time .ago. The type and
binding will probably be uniform with those of
“The Banjo’s” book, to be issued by the same
publishers shortly; and the four volumes (Victor
Daley is also to be added) will form a substantial
contribution towards a desirable library of young
Australian authors.

Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have bad occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what,
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Q TJ R S Ei Ii Tf B S !
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business'we do,-and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not tar out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves „ _
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and oontentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surelv the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHON Y HORDE UN’S .
naver cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
(t has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Flumors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest ‘and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [ No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be used from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood ot all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

MY NATIVE LAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My native land, my native land 1
Your fruits are sweet, your gardens fair ;
Your fields expand on every hand
With harvest rich and vintage rare ;
Your hills are green, your skies serene,
A generous sun upon you shines,
And far-off lands with hungry hands
Are envious of your priceless mines.
Whoever seeks your genial shores
Your city “Queen of Beauty ” greets,
But hopeless hearts are at your doors,
And haggard faces haunt your streets.
My native land, my native land !
I hold it blazons your disgrace
That ruffian bands with greedy hands
Are mighty in each judgment-place.
The air is pure, the mart secure,
Earth yields its toll of wool and gold ;
But hide your face—’tis your disgrace
To know of justice bought and sold.
To know that hunger hovers o’er
The homes where hope must hold aloof,
That famine lingers near the door,
And sorrow shadows many a roof.
My native land, my native land !
The church-bells ring from gilded spires,
The brazen burst of noise ascends,
The incense from the altar blends
With vapor from the brew-house fires ,
The portly sweater in the kirk
Sits cushioned in the foremost row ;
His lean, exploited victims lurk
Where it would soil his garb to go.
His hymn is sung. His organ peals.
His plate goes round. His prayer is said, j
But does that soothe the man who feels
That someone robs him of his bread ?
Some day— perhaps toward the end
Of this r a m-cwm-religion age—
The sweater’s glory-hymn may blend
With sweater-victims’ hymns of rage,
When blood-stained, bent on vengeance comes
The haggard army from the slums.
My native land, my native land !
Why should these evil things befall ?
Each eager field would gladly yield
A lusty store of food for all.
It is not right that through the night
From shade to shade starved people glide
And fight with dogs to get the crusts
That richer hands have thrown aside.
That is, I hold, the crowning shame
Of shames that all your glories mar,
A blight to damn the fairest name
And brand your beauty like a bar.
My native land, my native land !
These be but feeble words we say ;
I would that in my vengeful hand
They might be swords to smite and slay
The wrongs that prosper here to-day.
My native land, my native land 1

ROCK WALLABY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They sit at the doors of their rooky oastle,
Their bright eyes turned to the setting sun ;
Secure and calm in the peace of ages,
They hear the stream in the valleys run.
They take no heed of the world beyond it
Where human battles are lost and won.
From dizzy heights they can look around them,
And gaze on scenes we can never know —
The silver streak of the winding streamlet,
The topmost boughs of the trees below,
The crimsoned breast of a white bird flying
Towards the hills and the sunset’s glow.
They are full of secrets, these “ little people ; ”
They know of many a hidden cave; ,
They hear the call of the earth-bound river
To unknown shores that its waters lave,-
A sad, sweet song in the darkness fretting
For flow’rs and sun in its living grave.
Their young ones sleep to the gentle cadence,
The lullaby of the river-song ;
Their fathers heard it in long past ages—
It sings of joy when the pulse is strong,
And soothes the rest when the life-light flickers
Before the sleep that must last so long.
Perchance they know of the rich veins showing
Like lightning streaks in a stormy sky,
Of gems that sparkle in many a crevice
Not all the wealth of the world could buy ;
The secrets hid in the granite castles,
As “ silent people ” they live and die.
More fair to them are the dew-drops hanging
Like opals run on a silken string ;
Mure sweet the gold of the western heavens,
The rainbow tints on the bee-bird’s wing ;
More bright the sparkle of falling water
On silver sands at the mountain spring.
So they sit at the doors of their wind-swept castles
With calm eyes turned to the glowing west ;
The dingoes howl in the scrubs beneath them,
But they feel secure in their rocky nest.
And the tig-trees cling to the narrow ledges
Like posies pinned on the mountain’s breast.
You make me think, 0, you “little people 1 ”
Of old cave-dwellers beyond the sea,
Who lived and died and are quite forgotten—
For such your fate in the years must be.
But I pray for many a long day coming
The human rivers flow far from thee.

SATURDAY, JULY 27, 1895.
The S.A. State Band Bank.
When the Seddon Ministry established the
State Loan Department in Maoriland, for
the purpose of advancing money on mort-
gage at minimum rates, and thereby relieving
agriculture from a heavy weight of usury,
that progressive province led the way, as it
generally does, in a much-needed reform.
South Australia, the only other province of
Australasia where a really democratic
Government is in power, is now following in
its footsteps. Victoria is also considering
some preliminary steps in the same direc-
tion, and there seems reason to hope that
the land-bank principle will soon be in
operation in three out of the seven states of
Australasia. In New South Wales, unfor-
tunately, the time ot the last three Govern-
ments has been almost wholly occupied in
refixing or demolishing, or trying to refix or
demolish, the tariff of their predecessors,
and the next Government seems likely to be
similarly occupied ; and in the Legislatures of
Queensland andWestralia the somnolent Fat
Man is predominant, and nothing new ever
happens, unless it be some new scheme for
the exploitation of the people in the Fat
Man interest. Meanwhile, the two provinces
where the land-bank scheme has already
taken definite shape supply a valuable object-
lesson to their neighbors if the latter are
capable of profiting thereby,
* * *
The State Loan Department of Maoriland
started with one enormous defect, from
which sprung a number of smaller drawbacks
and disadvantages. It was built entirely on
English capital instead of upon local
resources, therefore, despite the low rate at
which that capital was obtained, there is
another serious addition to the already heavy
outflow of money to meet the claims of the
great abseniee pawnbroker, J. Bull. The
loan falls due at a fixed date, although a
remote one, and, as future loans will probably
be arranged on the same basis, the State
land-bank is liable to be seriously embar-
rassed if the date of repayment comes at a
time of financial stress. The State*receives
its money in huge sums at long intervals,'
and their influx tends to create periods of
unhealthy inflation. It has to pay interest
on those sums until they can be safely in-
vested, and makes a certain loss in the
interval, and the operations of the Loan
Department are liable to be brought up
short by a sudden refusal on the part of the
nominee Chamber, which views the whole
proceeding with an unfriendly eye, to
sanction further loans. What is wanted
is not the sudden and violent arrival
of large slabs of borrowed capital, but a
steady and constant influx of fixed deposits
which can be regulated so as to make the
demand and the supply correspond, to some
extent at least, with each other. The
object of the institution should be twofold :
to lend money to agriculturists and others,
but principally to agriculturists, at the
lowest convenient rate of interest and with
a minimum of red-tape and legal expense,
and also to provide the safest possible form
of local investment. The Maoriland Loan
Department fultils the latter half of its mis-
sion only in so far that it furnishes a very
good investment for the savings of the Eng-
lish people, and leaves those of its own
country almost entirely out of the reckoning.
• # «
The scheme propounded by the Kingston
Ministry is better in some respects and worse
in others, but, on the whole, it looks the
more democratic and the more distinctly
commendable of the two. The Bill now
before the Assembly, however, is a huge,
unwieldy affair which should have been
divided into three. One part concerns the
reconstruction of the Government Savings
Bank. Another provides that the said bank
is to be the sole note-issuing authority in
the province, and supplies the necessary rules
and regulations. These two devices, how-
ever commendable, have no bearing on the
present subject. The third section of the
Bill provides for the creation of a State
land-bank with a maximum capital of
£3,000,000 —a woefully inadequate amount,
but one which will doubtless be increased
if necessary. This capital is to be raised
by the issue of 4 per cent, deben-
tures in sums of £lO each, which will
be transferable by delivery, so that they
will circulate as freely as bank notes. The
interest certainly looks excessive ; seeing
that the State lately floated a local loan at
per cent., the State land-bank should
be able to get its money at the same figure.
Also, it is announced that the bonds are re-
deemable in seven years, and if this means that
the date of repayment is definitely fixed
seven years hence, then there is serious
trouble ahead for Premier Kingston's new
institution. Also, it is definitely provided
that all profits are to be used to reduce the
rate of interest to borrowers ; the*S.A. Loan
Department, unlike that of Maoriland, is
not to be a money-making institution in any
sense ; and this Quixotic proposition wants
to be demolished with the axe of hard
common-sense, and interred in the place set
apart for defunct fads of all kinds. The
State land-bank should get its money at the
lowest rate possible in Australia, it being an
absolutely irrevocable condition of its exist-
ence that it takes local deposits only. It
should lend that money out at the lowest
rate which hard economy in its management,
and the necessity of accumulating a reserve,
will allow. But it should accumulate a
reserve, and keep on accumulating all through
its existence. Even an institution which
never lends more than half the value of the
security, and which insists on a steady and
continuous reduction of the principal of its
debt, is not safe from disaster in this
most uncertain of all possible worlds. More-
over, it should be the object of the institu-
tion to accumulate trading capital of its own
apart from that which is borrowed from the
nation, and to become a great State asset to
set against the State’s many liabilities.
* # . *
The necessity for a State land-bank is
sufficiently understandable when the present
condition of the agricultural and pastoral
industry is considered. Through a variety
of causes, the mere enumeration of which
would take far too much space at present,
country lands are just now, and have been
for a long time, and seem likely to be
for some years longer, the most absolutely
unrealisable form of property in Australia.
Money lent upon them, even under condi-
tions which make its ultimate loss next to
impossible, is almost certain to be locked up
for very long periods. Therefore, an ordi-
nary institution, whose funds consist mainly
of short-dated deposits, cannot safely lend on
such security. The Australian banks which
are now either avowedly or unavowedly in
more or less serious difficulties—and this
includes nearly all the banks in this country
—owe a good portion of their troubles to the
fact that they borrowed money from the
public for terms ranging from three months
to five or six years, and invested much of it
in mortgages where it may not be recover-
able for a quarter of a century. The high
rates which they charged, partly in
view of this risk and mainly through
blind avarice and incapacity to take a
logical view of anything, helped to accelerate
the recent fall in values, and to make their
money still less recoverable ; and their frantic
efforts to extract payment from their debtors
after the crash of 1393 caused further depre-
ciation, and made the situation all the more
hopeless. The big life insurance societies
are able—as an insurance society cannot
well be rushed by creditors—to wait much
longer for a recovery, but even they cannot
afford to lock up money indefinitely ; and
the private mortgagee is generally in much
the same situation. Therefore, it has come
to pass in New South Wales, and in a less
degree in other provinces, that the man who
wants to borrow, up to half or even less than
half the present value of a purely agri-
cultural freehold, in this period of excessive
cheapness, has often to pay as much as 10
per cent, for the accommodation, and some-
times finds it difficult to procure even at
that exorbitant figure. Agricultural pro-
perty is so slow of realisation that the lender
must be prepared either to let his loan
stand for an indefinite period, or to foreclose
and take a very indefinite and far-off chance
of realisation. Therefore, a state of things
has arisen under which the most toilsome
and worst-paid industry in the land is
weighed down with the heaviest load of
interest, and one which it is utterly unable
to carry. The remedy obviously lies in
the establishment of an institution which
has an enormous amount of capital to
lend, which can lend cheaply because it
obtains its capital at a low rate, and which
can lend for very extensive periods so long
as it is covered by abundant secuiity, because
its capital is repayable solely at its own con-
venience. And the reason why the land-
bank should be a State instead of a private
institution is that the State can borrow—
and consequently lend—more cheaply than
any private company. Also, a further
reason is that, even under the most careful
system, a certain number of properties must
fall into the hands of the bank by foreclosure,
and the accumulation of property in the
hands of a joint-stock institution would be
a further aggravation of the evil of private
landlordism.
* * •
The Bulletin, therefore, suggests the fol-
lowing conditions as a basis for the State
land-banks, when these institutions definitely
arrive in Australia : (1) That their capital
should have no fixed limits and should be
raised by the issue, within Australia only, of
£5O, £2O, and £lO debentu res, bearing
interest of per cent., or less, if money be
procurable at a lower figure, and redeemable
at the option of the State only, at any time
after 10 years. (2) That the money thus
obtained be lent on freehold land, agricul-
tural land always having the preference, to
the extent of not more than half its value, at 5
per cent, interest, with either 1 or 2 per cent,
added for the repayment of the principal.
The borrower would thus wipe off principal
and interest by a payment of six or seven
percent., whereas he now pays more than
that rate for interest alone, and the constant
reduction of the total amount outstanding
would protect the institution, in a great
measure, from any possible loss through
depreciation of the security. (3) That all
work in connection with valuations and the
preparation and release of mortgages be
done by the bank’s own officers at the lowest
possible rates, which should be about one-
third of those now charged by the ordinary
legal shark. And (4) that out of the differ-
ence of £1 10s. per cent, between the bor-
rowing and lending rates, 10s. per cent, be
set aside as a reserve, one-half of it being
employed in new loans and the other half
invested in Government securities as a pro-
vision for unforeseen emergencies, and that
all profits arising from the investment of the
reserve be further reserved in the same
fashion. The other £1 per cent could be
made to cover all working expenses even at
the outset, and if these can be reduced-
and they should be reducible in course of
time by one-half—then of the amount thus
saved one-half should allotted to borrowers
in reduction of their debts, and the other
half go to the reserve. When the State takes
over the issue of notes, that issue might be
made through the land-bank, and the profits
arising from it be also added to the reserve.
* • m
The debentures of the State land-bank
would probably have almost the same cur-
rency as bank-notes, and in times of financial
panic they could be made to answer the
same purpose as a temporai-y legal tender
note-issue. A considerable amount of the
gold-reserves now lying unprofitably in the
coffers of the banks would doubtless be in-
vested in these securities, and between the
banks and private lenders the amount of
money locally available should be fully equal
to, if not in excess of, requirements. The
operations of the institution would relieve
the agricultural class of a heavy load in in-
terest, and thereby make agriculture more
profitable ; they would help to prevent future
banking panics by taking this class of busi-
ness to a great extent out of the hands of
private institutions, whose interference in it
has been woefully disastrous to ail parties
concerned ; and by helping the agricultural
industry they would increase the value of
country lands, and thereby enrich the small
independent landholder. Also, if not coun-
teracted in this respect by other measures,
they would increase the value of the land
shark's big estate, and thus enable him to
charge heavier rents to his miserable tenants.
Consequently, the old moral once more arises
that the large landowner, and still more the
large landholder who does not cultivate his
own property but lets it out to tenants, and,
above all, the large landholder who does
this, and spends his rents abroad as an
absentee in addition to his other sins, re-
quire to be struck by a tax which will effec-
tually discouiage their particular branch of
capitalism. Otherwise the land-bank system
would indirectly tend to increase the burden
of rent and to help on the accumulation of
big estates, by making the occupation of the
big land-grabber mure profitable than id
now is.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Tobacco Monopoly.
Mr. J. M. Sinclair, one of the many commis-
sioners that Victoria sent abroad in the days of
'Patterson and his predecessors, lias come back
with a valuable idea—about the only one which
the country has received in return for much
expenditure. He proposes that Victoria should
follow the lead of France, Italy, and other
European countries by making the manufacture
and sale of tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and snuff
—if there is any demand for snuff nowadays—a
State monopoly. The idea is regarded as dis-
tinctly “un-English,” and, therefore, it has come
with a considerable shock on the community,
but it has much to recommend it, none the less.
In France the tobacco monopoly yields a clear
profit to the Government of .£12,000,000
annually. In Austria-Hungary it returns a
profit of about £00,000,000, and in many other
countries it works satisfactorily and furnishes
a substantial revenue. Considering the heavy
consumption in Victoria, the monopoly should
supply a revenue to the Melbourne Treasury of
at least .£600,000, at present wholesale and
retail prices, whereas the present tobacco-tax
returns only half that amount, and the differ-
ence is an item of very considerable import-
ance. It is also one which will increase with
the growth of population. The great ques-
tion now in all the Australias is to
obtain more revenue—much more revenue,
so as to construct public works without
borrowing, and to remedy the eternal
deficit, and yet to pile as few new taxes as pos-
sible on an aggravated nation which generally
rejects a heavy - taxing Government at the
earliest opportunity. Tobacco and drink mono-
polies, a iState Land Bank, and a State paper
currency are all possible sources of income
which would imply no visible taxation, and as
such they are just the sort of thing wliich the
hard-driven public financier craves after. And,
in addition to this, the tobacco monopoly has
certain collateral advantages. The State, as
the sole manufacturer and wholesale dealer,
would buy its supplies of raw material as far as
possible from the local producer, at a fixed
price, on well-defined conditions. A certain
standard of quality would lie insisted on, and
if the local grower exerted himself to reach
that standard, the State would take all his
product up to the limit of its requirements, and
give him the preference over the importer.
Thus, provided he took sufficient pains to turn
out a high-class article, lie would have a con-
stant and reliable market provided for him; if
he didn’t take the necessary pains the business
would go to the cheapest foreign producer who
did. The State tobacco monopoly would
thus give immense assistance to the local
grower if he was worth assisting, and its
factories would pay to local workmen a
large amount in wages which now goes abroad.
Also the system would ensure that the
goods sold would be of good quality, if the
nation was not too tired to insist that they
should be so. And, for the benefit of that large
section of the community which is British above
all things, it is worth noting that the tobacco
monopoly—like a good many other things—is
not quite so “ un-English” as is generally sup-
posed. In India, where the British officials had
a comparatively free hand to work according to
the dictates of common sense, the largest source
of revenue is the land-tax, the next largest the
State railways, and two other important items
of revenue are the profits of the State opium
monopoly and of the State paper currency.
The difference between an opium and a tobacco
monopoly is merely a difference of circum-
stances.
MacLaurin on Land-Tax.
One of the objections to the N.S.VV. land-tax
so eloquently advanced by Dr, MacLaurik,
M.L.C., was as follow’s ;
The real object of the Government, so far as I can find
out, if they understand their object at all, is to impose a
tax which would be more severe upon the country than it
is upon the town, and for the following reasons; if any
one will look through ilr. Coghlau’s last bonk he will find,
if he makes a comparison between the people in municipal-
ities which are practically town populations and the people
outside municipalities, that in the municipalities the value
of the land is al)out£78,000,000, and the value of buildings
and improvements about £72,000,000. That is to say,
practically speaking, the lands and improvements are of
equal value. On the other hand, in the country outside the
municipalities, the value of the land is about £97,000,000,
and the value of the improvements £57,000,000, of which
£9,000,000 worth are on Crown lands, leaving £48,000,000
worth on private lands. That is to say, outside the
municipalities the value of the lands is to the value of the
improvements as twm to one. What is the result? The
result is that a person who lives in the town pays Id. in
the £ on half of his property, whereas the man that lives
in the country pays Id. in the £ on two-thirds of his pro-
perly. That is the real boiling-down of the Bill.
This is a Hue example of the kind of whizzing
noise that does duty for logic. The proposal to
tax land at tne same figure all round is inequit-
able, according to Dr. MacLaurin, because tbo
town inhabitant has pub more improvements on
his property, ‘and paid for them, than the
farmer. And, on the same basis, the land-tax
would be inequitable if there were more cross-
eyed peopfe, or men with bow-legs, to each acre
in the city than in the country, “Also, the dog-
tax is inequitable because there are more dogs
to the square mile in Sydney than there
are out by the Bar won. The MacLaurin
theory, boiled down into very inferior tallow,
and carried to its logical conclusion, practically
amounts to this : that the same thing shouldn’t
be taxed at the same rate throughout the coun-
try, unless the thing that stands on top of it is
of the same value in each case. Therefore, the
land in George-stfeet, Sydney, which has the
Equitable building on top of it, shouldn’t be
taxed on the same scale as a piece of equal
value in the same street with a two-storey
shanty on it. Likewise, the man with a straw
hat on top of him as an improvement should
pay less taxes than a man with a bell-topper.
Every argument wants to be stood on its bead
and inspected both ways up before it is accepted.


Gambling' is Scriptural.
Dear Bulletin,-— Victorian parsons cry aloud
against gambling, and their cry is chorused
stertorously by the “books.” But what is the
verdict of the Book ? In Leviticus (xvi.), Aaron
“tosses up” (or oasts lots) witli God for the
scapegoat. In Numbers (xxvi.), the land by a
Mosaic law is divided on the art-union principle.
In Joshua (vii.), capital punishment is inflicted
on the verdict of dice, or some similar exemplar
of innumerable possibilities, and the victim
confesses the crime. In Samuel (x.), a king is
chosen “by lot”—and he was as big a failure
as other kings. In Acts (i.), a capable apostle
is chosen in the same way. The words of
Solomon on the subject are—
The lot is cast into the lap: but the whole disposing
thereof is of the Lord. . .
Gambling was a pastime of the Jews, but
nowhere is it condemned in their Scriptures.
Usury, “ sweating,” false weights, hard drink-
ing, monopoly, land alienation, etc., etc., got
heavy knocks from Moses and the prophets—
but gambling goes unchid. Whence get the
parsons their brief ? The bookmaker is perhaps
the devil’s advocate, and he barracks with the
parson now. Is gambling in itself vicious?
Giffen and Stoddart “ toss .up for first
innings in an “International ” —is this wicked?
Four bishops play whist —3d. a corner ; what
moral law is violated? John Smith put a
pound he can spare on the tote —is he to be
kept out of heaven by the parsons, and boy-
cotted in hades by the bookies ? The parsons
and the pencillers they toil not, but they do
spin yarns. There can be excess in gambling
just as there is excess in parsons. Excess is the
trouble. The bookmaker’s cause is a leak in
the economic boiler, but the tote is a safety-
valve for exuberance ! The parsons’ idea seems
to be to stop up leaks, and then run the boiler
without a safety-valve.—F.
Where the Assets are.
Any one who cares to form an idea how the
selector and the individual pastoralist are being
wiped out in New South Wales by those
eternal mortgagees, the banks, and how the
country is getting along to that fine British
condition in which everyone will work for a
landlord and no one will work for himself,
should study the Government Gazette. The
pages of that cold and business-like publication
are full of information to the reader with a
seeing eye and a large, anxious ear. Here are
a few examples taken at random from the
latest issues : On pages 4T27-34 appears a list
of certain pastoral leases in the Central Divi-
sion on which extensions have been granted.
There are 486 squatting properties on the list,
and 244 of these are registered as belong-
ing to banks and finance companies. On
pages 4185-88 appear sundry lists of con-
ditional purchases for which it is intended
to issue certificates. Out of 31 properties
on one list (page 4186) nine belong to
banks and one to a Scotch insurance society.
There are 38 names on the next list, and they
include seven banks and one finance co. Out of
49 selections on page 4187, 12 belong to banks,
but out of 35 selections on page 4188, the banks
hold only six. There are nine conditional pur-
chases in a list on page 4173, and of these one
bank owns four. On page 4025, it is announced
that certificates are to be issued upon 40 condi-
tional purchases, of which eight are held by
banks. Thirty-eight selections are mentioned
in a similar list on page 4027, and of these 11
are in the hands of banks and finance com-
panies. On page 4085 appears a list of 31 selec-
tions, portions of which are to be resumed for
roads, and of these various banks appear as the
registered owners of seven. The Gazette of
4th July announces that 208 “preferential
occupation licenses ” have been granted
in the Central Division, and 56 of these
are granted to banks and financial com-
panies. Nine out of 50 selections on page
4333, for which certificates are to issue,
are in the hands of the same eternal mortgagee,
and seven out of 29 on page 4331. The trail of
the bank is over the entire pastoral and agricul-
tural industry of the province. Probably few
shareholders have any idea how much of their
alleged assets consist of hundreds of little
isolated patches of land dotted over all parts,
even the most remote, of this great loan land.
If they knew the story in its entirety they
would probably hang their scrip on a willow-
tree, and weep bitterly, and refuse to be com-
forted.
A bill now before Maoriland Parliament pro-
vides that any person owning a house and land
to a value not exceeding ,£l5OO can settle them,
by a very inexpensive process, on his wife and
children, and after the settlement has been six
months in force the property is absolutely pro-
tected against all creditors. The old man has
the use of it during his lifetime, but at his
death the settlement takes effect. This is good
enough so far as it goes, but, like a similar
scheme propounded in New South Wales, it
doesn’t go nearly far enough. It is intended
principally as a protection for the agricultural
settler, and that person is just the one whose
chronic ignorance of law and natural inertia—
not to say lumpishness—will prevent him
making adequate use of it, while the city specu-
lator and the professional landlord and all the
bird-of-prey element will adopt it liberally.
What is required is a law providing that every
man’s freehold home and—if he is an agricul-
turist or pastoralist—a certain number of acres
attached thereto, shall be absolutely protected
against seizure by any creditor, the Govern-
ment alone excepted, for any debts, on mort-
gage or otherwise, incurred after the passing of
the Act, without any registration process what-
ever. Every man, when his existing mortgage
is wiped off, would thus be prevented from in-
curring a new one so far as his actual place of
residence is concerned, and nobody could
acquire the right to eject anybody else and his
family into a stony world. The hitherto in-
alienable right of one man to “ sling out ”
another has been recognised altogether too long.
The most persistent and prevalent feature of
politics, and in politicians, is inconsistency.
Almost every prominent Freetrader in N.S.W.
Assembly has been, at some time or other, a
clamorous Protectionist; almost every Protec-
tionist has been a Freetrader. Many of the
Opposition, both in Assembly and Council, who
the other day voted against land-taxation,
loudly advocated it a year or two ago. Half
the measures now moved by the Reid Govt,
and opposed by the Dibbs party were, two
years ago, moved by the Dibbs Govt, and
opposed by the Reid party. “ Hi don’t want
hoffis ” one week ; Hi lead a forlorn hope to
grab hoffis the next. The Joe Chamberlain
of old becomes the honorable aristocrat and
Tory colleague of now. Parkes of 42 years
ago hurled “ Brummagem House of Lords ” at
Wentworth, then an ex-patriot turned Tory
and groveller ; now, Premier Reid flings the
phrase at Parkes, himself turned boot-polisher
and champion of a Tory Upper House. Corol-
lary : Let any man keep a full and truthful
diary for ten solid years, and, at the end of the
decade, look back at what he idas and see if he
can identify that with what he is.
Some impecunious Treasurer might seriously
consider tile advisability of raising the minimum
fine for the common or garden drunk to 205.,
and for t he drunk with trimmings to 405., with
corresponding increases for bad language,
common assault, and breakage. Victoria could
raise £30,000 a year easily from this source,
and N.S.W. £50,000. Another valuable idea
would be to add to each line (say) 25 per cent,
additional costs as payment for the use of the
court and magistrate. This particular aspect
of the costs question hasn’t been considered so
far, yet when a ss. drunk gets the use of a
£5OOO courthouse to be fined in, it is only reason-
able that he should pay for it. The drunk and
the language and assault persons are neglected
sources of revenue. Still another idea would
be to let off the more affluent minor offender
without any money penalty at all, but to
sentence him to take up interminable 2£ per
cent. State debentures for, say, 20 times the
amount of his lawful tine. As a means of
raising money cheaply in the country there are
some valuable points about this idea, and Aus-
tralia might ultimately pay off its foreign
indebtedness out of its drunks and disorderlies
and other small criminals. The drunk, in
short, is a mine which wants to be properly
worked, and it is incomprehensible that, while
politicians have been at their wits’ end for
money any time this last 10 years, he should
have been neglected.
The case of two young men arrested at Colling-
wood (Vic.) recently is of Australasian interest.
They were unimportant young men, and were
arrested confessedly for doing nothing. No
man with a shabby coat and patched pants can
safely do nothing in Melbourne. The arresting
constable deposed that there had been a number
of robberies in Colling wood lately, and he ran
in the two young men in question in consequence
—not because there was the remotest visible
connection between them and the robberies,
but because they seemed to come handy, and it
was as well to run them in as anybody else.
Anyhow, the policeman had nothing else to do
at the time, so it didn’t matter. A liigh-piriced
lawyer was called into requisition, and he
proved that the prisoners had been working up
country recently, but had been unable to get
anything to do since their return to town, be-
cause they couldn’t well look for work whilst
they were locked up for not having work ; but
they were very sorry, and wouldn’t do it again.
In consideration of these expressions of contri-
tion, the Bench took a lenient view of the case,
and discharged the prisoners severely. The
young men then paid their lawyer and went
home. The next time a man is arrested for
being out of work, The Bulletin hopes all the
employers in the vicinity will be charged with
being accessories before the fact. It would be
strictly logical.
The N.S.W. Government has made a tolerably
bad beginning with its perpetual leasing system,
provided for under the new Lauds Act. The
first soil thrown open under its provisions is out
in the West, in the land of Goo-forgotten,
about nine or ten miles from Bourke. It is
irrigated from an adjacent bore, and the rental
is estimated on the very high capital value of
£2O an acre. Another experiment is being
made at Temora with almost waterless land,
which the department values at from
255. to 40s. an acre. The perpetual leas-
ing system isn’t likely to amount to much
under these conditions. If it is to have
anything like a fair chance the Govern-
ment should include in its Land Tax Bill,
when it is next introduced, a clause by
which it can resume large estates at a small
percentage over the tax valuation, and then try
its perpetual leasing system in the Eastern
Division, where markets are more adjacent and
the drought spectre doesn’t stalk about so
persistently. As The Bulletin has said over
and over again, it is not the Central Division
which so badly wants to be opened up as the
Eastern one. There is enough land there lying
unused in the hands of Fat Men and speculative
syndicates to meet the demands of agriculturists
for some years to come, and the policy which
allows the Fat Man and the syndicate indi-
vidual to block settlement in the coastal regions,
and shoves the agriculturist far out into the
dismal West, doesn’t give the latter anything
like a fair chance. A perpetual lease at an
annual rent of 10s. per acre, in the vicinity of
Bourke, is about as dismal a thing as any man
could have.
A Melb. Herald genius describes Kev.
Haskett Smith’s lectures :
He tells the story of his travels, and does not really
lecture, and draws a vivid mental picture, which is splen-
didly supplemented by the very excellent views which
are presented. Mr. Haskett Smith took his audience to
the hill of Calvary, where the crucifixion is held to have
taken place ( sic!), the Pole (sic!) of Si loam, and the
Mount of Olives, keeping their interest unshaken (sic !)
while he discoursed upon the sacred stories attaching to
these historic spots.
The crucifixion being “held to have taken place”
at Calvary is delightful from a paper the man-
aging editor and half the directors of which are
Catholics. And the “Polo of Siloam !”
Stephen Stambouloff, the Bulgarian ex-
Premier, who was fatally hacked by a gang of
assassins, the other day, in the streets of Sophia,
supplies a fine example of national ingratitude.
When Bulgaria came into political existence
about 17 years ago it was little better than a heap
of ashes with a starving community rooting tor
food among the ruins. Stambouloff—the one
brainy, iron-handed patriot among a crowd of
nonentities—re-built its ruined towns, organised
its finances, created an army strong enough to
wipe out the invading Servians, established
a liberal system of education, and contrived,
with the very narrow resources of a very
miserable little kingdom, to stave off Russia
on one side and Turkey on the other. He
propped up Alexander all through his stormy
reign, and when that gaudy Battenberg gave up
the struggle, and Russian annexation was im-
minent, he made himself practically dictator, and
broke up the pro-Russian movement. Then
Panitza organised another Russian conspiracy
with a great part of the army at his back, and
Stambouloff, when everybody else was paralysed
and the country was degenerating into a reign of
terror, cut the matter short by arresting him with
his own hands, and hauling him away to prison
and execution. But at last the Bulgarians grew
tired of their one great statesman, and Ferdinand,
the scented prince and botanist, with the 150 em-
broidered shirts, sacked him for not possessing
sufficiently elegant manners and for a general
want of respect to his royal master. He be-
came virtually a prisoner, not being allowed
to leave Bulgaria. He was tried on various futile
charges. The mob in the street, incited by
Russian agents, threw mud and stones at their
national hero. He was ineffectually shot at on
sundry occasions by conspirators who could not
aim reasonably straight, and he became pre-
maturely old and a hopeless wreck from diabetes.
Finally, he was fatally mangled, in broad day-
light, by four assassins, and died with both his
hands cut off and 2G wounds on his head and else-
where. Stambouloff was probably the most
picturesque patriot Europe has produced since
Garibaldi, and his tenth-rate country throws a
dejected little brick at his memory by way of
reward for all he did on its behalf. It also threw
bricks and mud at his funeral, and his coffin had
to be protected by the police.

The shrill promoter floats his company,
The sham reformer’s for a title sold,
And in one mighty chorus all agree :
“ So he be not a lord or have no purse,
Ho w can he be deserving of a verse ? ”
“ My Lord” —Good Lord!—a hundred years ago
A great man was, and then became .1 peer ;
His greatness he belittled ; did he know
That with himself the brains would disappear
From out his stock and leave an empty show,
A shell, a name, the subject of a jeer
When Lord Tomnoddy’s hobby we report ?
Skirt-dancing ’neath the lime-lights is his forte.
Ye slaves of custom ! will ye never learn
The man’s own actions measure real worth ?
Why can ye not the staring truth discern
That he who boasts of nothing but his birth
And trades on it to play the fool, or turn
To vice unchecked, or vacant drunken mirth,
Or deems him fashioned out of finer clay,
Is but a rotting branch best cut away ?
What faults, what follies oft the name con-
dones !
A royal courtesan, that flaunts her shame :
A title may be won by timely loans;
Beer, if one brew enough, will do the same ;
A cmcp which, lost, will end in breaking stones
Gets Mr. Jones a handle to his name.
On grounds like these descends from sire to son
The rank upheld as nobly as ’twas won.
And here to southern skies the taint has spread;
We have our “honors,” too (God save the
mark !)
The “ golden link,” the Governor, at the head,
Whose levees form a sort of social ark
Where knights of dubious grammar proudly
tread
Beside their would-be comrades, the fat shark
Of many acres, and the politician
Whose wife declares a title is his mission.
By this great deity there sits one more
Who’s greater still and still more widely
wooed ;
Rank all men worship ; gold they all adore,
All-potent'wealth, whose worshippers include
Saint, sinner, worldling, parson, wit and bore,
The gay, the sad, the prurient and the prude ;
To count their total no one head is able,
E’en with a money-lender’s interest-table.
“How came that wealth?” Who wants to
know to-day ?
What though the owner is a rogue complete,
Who robs his clients—in a legal way,
Or, looking far too holy e’er to cheat,
Makes helpless women his especial prey,
Or sweats the sempstress —till she walks the
street,
Or starves : “ the money smells not,” says the
poet ;
So none should care to what ill-deeds they
owe it.
“A wealthy man !” what magic in the word !
The gilded cad is merely “ most outspoken ;”
The rich seducer—“ Well, perhaps he’s erred,
But hers the fault—her poverty’s the token ;”
A drunken beast—“Oh, yes, it lias occurred
That he the bounds of temperance has
broken.”
Be rich, and you may be a brute or devil ;
Be poor, you must not touch the skirts of evil.
And while these potent deities remain ;
While honesty and honor are as naught
To rank and wealth, that cover every stain
Of deeds ignoble by which they were sought ;
While wealth’s the test, and freeborn men will
deign
To truckle for distinction to a court ;
Our social system none can ever mend :
We’re fools, and suffer for it to the end.

Hygiene teaches that nothing is so bene-
ficial to the human constitution as thorough
cleanliness, a theory verified by modern revela-
tions of the deadly microbes which infest the
flesh and blood—especially if we do not keep
ourselves in a clean condition, which ought to be
the first aim of every individual with any esteem
for himself. The use of Amykos has proved to be
very important to this end, by its great sanitary
power over the skin, mouth, teeth, &c. If you
value yourself, never be without this excellent pre-
paration.*

My Dear Moorabinpa—
The reception given by Air. Clifford Hall<s and
Miss Ribbentrop, at the Grosvenor Hotel, the
other day, was one of the lamest shows in the
annals of daylight entertainment. A mere clutch
of people turned up, and sat round with the*
aspect of uninterested mourners waiting to hear
a dead insolvent’s will read, and listened to the
massive hostess devoting herself mostly to a friend
who had been quarantined with her. Aliss Rihhen-
trop waa so wrapped up in fighting her yellow-
flag battles oer again that I am sure the rest of
the audience felt rather de trap, which possibly
accounted for the early exodus.
Air. Halle is a tall, thin, adjutant-bird sort of a
man, reminding you of Captain Feildingand Ray-
mond Blathwayt rolled into one paste, and ap-
pears to suffer in private from a desire to lecture
Ids visitors. Doubtless Mr. Halle enunciated
many wise and improving statements in a long
afternoon of loquacity, for he is cruelly perfect in
his musical views, but most of his guests would
have preferred to hear either him or Aliss Rihben-
trop sing—an ounce of practice is worth a ton of
theory. However, neither “obliged the com-
pany,” which drifted away, wondering if Air. H.
and Aliss R. constituted a show in themselves,
and merely invited you to gaze upon them and
die, so to speak. As a rule, musical people give
you a taste of their quality on these occasions—
otherwise society can’t help marvelling why
they’ve roused it out 1
Lord Brassey has been feted in London previous
to his taking ship to Australia, and it has been
thought necessary to cable that “his lordship
would consider it his greatest duty to foster the
kindly feelings binding the silken fetters of mutual
pride and^ affection between Great Britain and her
colonies. I think this wild remark now comes
under the heading of “chestnuts,” and should
certainly be taken as written, since it is as integ-
ral a part of a Governor’s outfit as his cocked hat,
and people who solemnly and expensively wire it
out at every gubernatorial shuffle evidently havg
no idea of the value of cable-space.
But, desp'te many flattering indications of a
set-fair vice regal atmosphere for Alelhourne, I
have my doubts of Brassey’s success if the “good
story which a Sydney daily recently alleged
that Lord B. ‘ told about himself ” is a sample of
the new Vie. Governor’s abilities as a humorist.
I his is the “good story” (it certainly requires an
indicator or a hand-painting);—“ On the day pre-
vious his lordship spoke at Harrow at a meeting
in support of Dr. Barnardo’s homes. After the
meeting he started to walk back to London, and
came up to four little girls who had been at the
meeting. ‘ What did you think of Lord Brassey? ’
asked one. ‘I thought him a nice gentleman,’
said another. ‘I didn’t,’ said the third; ‘he
can’t speak a bit—he hummed and ha’d all the
time! ’ Apart from the awful revelation from
the lips of babes and sucklings that Victoria’s
new vice-regal ideal is one of those irritating after-
dinner orators who say that “ it—er—er—er— hum
affords me much—hum—pleasure to find myself
—er er hum,’ there is the deeper horror that
H.E. should consider such a Band of Hope anec-
dote worth repeating when the press was about.
Even Charley’s Aunt told a funnier tale than that.
Major-General and Airs. Hutton are not long
for this part of the world, as x the curly-haired
commandant’s term expires in April next, and
they will probably leave for ’Ome in that favor-
able month of exodus—Alarch. Golden-haired
Mrs. Hutton should receive a grateful send-off at
the hands of society, for her brilliant parties
stopped a very hungry hole during the late dreary
vice-regal administration. Looks, style, toilet,
tact and vyealth were all on her side, combined
with a pedigree almost as elongated as Hampden’s
and peppered with illustrious fighting-men, one of
whom is the Sir Richard Grenville immortalised
by Tennyson. The belligerent commander, how-
ever, is the son of a parson, though there must
have been a love of gunpowder in the family, for
Ins mother married a general after the cleric went
to head quarters with his report, as it were.
Talking of the milingtary, a warlike Sydney
military journal, evidently edited by a half-pay
captain with a flower in his buttonhole, recently
remarked : “We would like to see some fresh
blood infused into the Sydney Lancers. . . .
It seems strange that the merchant sons of Syd-
ney, who have all plenty of horses, should not
volunteer more to fill the ranks of the lancers.”
To my notion, it would he a good deal more
convincing if fresh blood were let out of the
pictorial Sydney Lancers, who have never got a
scratch during their nominally warlike career. A
soldier who hasn’t smelt gunpowder is as uncon-
vincing as his little tin prototypes in the toy-
shops. And, as for the “ merchant sons ” —the
corps was so outraged, once upon a time, at the
presence among it of a beastly tradesman who sold
socks, that Sydney youths with scales and a counter
even in the middle distance of their escutcheon
have ever since been too nervous to apply. They
never knew when this fastidious corps considered
that the drapah ceased and the Lanceah began.
Ami, apart from this, the expense of belonging to
the squad which bumps so at the trot is enough to
deter many a youth from entering. At least one
N.S. W. couple is absolutely piano-less owing to
hubby’s military ardor. The “century ”of piano
money went to buy a butterfly gold-laced suit for
Gussie—to go and be shot in by-and-by, for all he
or his wife knows to the contrary.
On dit that a recently- broken engagement
between a massively handsome Sydneygirl and her
late swain is almost on again. The lady recently
paid a visit to the native city of her former
Romeo, and report says a reconciliation was the
result. However, the re-engagement is not yet
officially announced, but society hopes for the
best.
The reception of honor to General Dodds (a
recent military meteor in the Australian social
firmament), at the Hotel Australia, last Saturday
evening, was a well-harbered, well-gloved spec-
tacle. with perhaps more English “poker” in
the mixture than is usual in French festivities.
But the, reception was inherently French, being
arranged by a French committee, with Dr. Laure
as president and M. Funck hon. secretary, and
including Messieurs Adet, Blanc, Durienx, Me-
tayer, Rev. P&re le Rennetel, and Dr. Rougier, all
of whom must have been charmed at the complete
success of their admirable arrangements, musical,
decorative, and otherwise. But until French com-
mittees learn to lay on a supply of national sparkle
for the use of their English guests only, they
cannot hope to preserve the delicate bouquet of
Parisian gaiety at their Franco-Anglo festivals.
As a regulator of spontaneous mirth, one average
English person balanced by three airy French
folks has the same effect as an ounce of sand to
three ounces of feathers. Even champagne-cup
a fa Dr. Monkhonse Brierly didn’t avail, on the
occasion I speak of, to bring the distinguished
company up to French soiree pitch.
The hero of the evening, General Dodds, who
twined additional laurels round his head during
the Dahomeyan war, came in great style, with a
gold-trimmed tunic leading gently on to a pair of
scarlet trousers and golden spurs. I thought those
spurs a good hint for the next Coolgardie lucky
digger. Or do they only suggest a new reading of
the “ silver spoon ” pryverb—“horn with golden
spurs on his heels ?” lam sure the General —who
was so gorgeously dressed himself that he must
appreciate fal-lalery—couldn’t help liking the
frocking, which was clever, taking the average,
and Frenchy into the bargain. The Acting-
Governoress (whose perpetual smile, by the
way, on occasions of this kind is creating a
dreadful smirk-record for the coming Viscountess
to live up to, especially if she happens to wear
shop-teeth) wore a black dress with a white front,
with plenty of glitter from jet and diamonds.
Aliss Darley (who always looks to me as if she
were sitting in judgment on the fleeting show)
also wore the hue of the minstrel corner-man’s
cheek. Mrs. Hutton was in grey and white satin
and diamonds. Mrs. (Justice) Innes glittered in
black, with violet-velvet sleeves, and a good dis-
play of the jewels Marguerite left her home for.
Aladame Lanre, wife of the president, also wore a
sparkling black gown—indeed, almost everybody
honored the occasion in her attire.
Perhaps- the most picturesque person in the
richly-dressed assemblage was a recent arrival
from France, who sported a long frock of white
brocade, with plenty of tail, anyhow, if the
bodice was only the size of a duty-stamp with a
bite out of it. She reminded me of the white girl
in the “ Peacemaker,’’ and was quite the opposite
of a lady in coooanut-ice combination, made in a
stage-ward robe sort of way —en polonaise, with
flights of little pink bows ; or a matron, with one
green feather on her head, reminding one of a
pretty Joey which had moulted all but its top-
knot. Alusic was amiably contributed by Madame
Kellermann—in yellow brocade, with a corsage
trimming of medals, a lady-amateur vocalist,
Kowalski, Poussard (always a personally-popnlar
artist), Vollrnar and Stael, while Madame Aengen-
heyster (in heliotrope) gave a French recitation.
The committee’s thanks to the trio of artistes took
the form of bouquets, but nobody thought of the
artists. Nobody ever does, though lam sure men
would appreciate a buttonhole just as much as
women gurgle over a bouquet.
East Sydney Rowing Club annual ball scored a
huge failure this year, when only a sprinkle of
couples turned up to play hide-and-seek in the big
The dressing was
quite as dispiriting as the attendance. One lady
had copied Flo. Young’s “ Madame Lange ” pink
and black dress as nearly as she could manage,
only she left out Aliss Young’s principal attrac-
tion—that shapely pink leg which shot out
through a crack in the draperies, now and again.
The rest seemed to be dressed in “art” costumes,
like bags gathered round the neck, though the
prevalent off-the-shonlder sleeve had a good fol-
lowing, of course. The E.S.R.O. have some idea
of cheapening down to a five-shilling dance next
year, I am told.
While talking about pay-to-go-in dances, the
annual ball in aid of Tempe Refuge (it’s just been
painted a deep cerulean bine—l mean the Refuge,
of course) is hilled for the 30th in Sydney Town
Hall, and means to wipe the flure with other
public dances of its weight and dignity. There
is to be fancy-dancing to amuse the galleryites,
but this will not interfere witli the public dancing
in any way—which almost looks as if the fancy
sets were going to perform on the ceiling. In
which case a crowded house is assured. The big
blazing Masonic ball occurs next evening (31st).
I think the idea of amalgamating all the little
Alasonio “socials ” into one aggravated entertain-
ment is a noble notion on somebody’s part.
Talking of festivities reminds me that the most
searching criticism it is possible to throw at any
social entertainment was thrown in Sydney a
while ago, after a high social clam-bake, or what-
ever it might be, was over, and the guests had
got away in apple-pie order, expressing themselves
as charmed and overwhelmed at the joy of spend-
ing such a pleasant evening until they got
round the corner. Then the whole crowd of
them (assorted species) bolted headlong fora cafe (I
don’t know which cafe, but it ought to have hi en
Paris House if they had ever studied the mouth-
watering menu which prevails, now thatLievain’s
taken the place in hand), and sat down to a large,
square, groaning supper—the whole hordeof them.
Then they really did begin to enjoy their evening.
Apropos of midnight suppers, I heard that one
large and merry group of 21 souls managed to
work up to the state of playing the piano with
their hats, and frivolities like that, on three
bottles of fizz! The miracle of the loaves and
fishes may now retire with its record broken.
“In Town ” seems to be the mustard-plaster of
the Gaiety Co.’s repertoire—l mean for drawing
houses to Sydney Lyceum, though it’s been
hustled in the straight, so to speak, by dainty
Decima Aloore’s vocal shakiness as Kitty Hether-
ington, Aliss Moore, of whom a very charming
picture by Falk is printed elsewhere in this issue,
however, atones for her little bronchial echo of a
sweet refined voice by putting real acting into it,
and making Kitty’s part something more than an
animated broomstick humbly waiting to give Cod-
dington his cues. Have you noticed that the bound
ingßradfield isn’t right up to date in at least one
hit of In’s pantomime in “ Some do it this way ?’’
Thesupposititious supper-scene, parexemple, when
the lady makes a great fuss tying the strings of
her “ dolman.” No woman ties her top wrap in
with a ribbon nowadays, so that pulley-hauling
business looks un-modern. The last time I saw
“In Town,” Claire Leighton took Aland Hobson’s
part in the tights of Romeo. I don’t like to be
personal, hut if Romeo’s legs were anything like
Claire Leighton’s, it’s no wonder he kept Juliet
firmly fixed at a great height above him when he
started the “ really mean it,” as the song says.
Apropos of the Gaiety girls—they remind me
that Sydney Johnniedom missed a rare chance for
a cheap quiz when they let the lithe and good-
looking Samoan dancing-girls (who are going to
do Europe on exhibit) escape per German steamer
in an unadmired state, and even missed attending
a large dance given in the copper-colored ladies’
honor, when there was, I hear, a dress (?) rehear-
sal of the Samoan ballets which are about to make
the Germans blush. The girls are said to be a
prime consignment—but when you come to think
of Mr. Louis Becke’s wicked stories “By Reef
and Palm,” it really seems quite providential
nobody put Gussie and Cholly near the track of
these potato-colored Yenuses.
In “Thoroughbred,” writes my Melb. corres*
pondent, Miss Faber wears the prettiest gown
she has shown up to date. Wall-paper pattern
brocade of pink azaleas on cream satin ground,
bodice of pale sulphur satin, shrouded with stem-
green accordeon chiffon. Miss Noble, too, looks

Despite the sneers of unsympathetic males, con*
tinues my correspondent, the Austral Salon is
booming. Last Monday, at Mrs. Saddler’s “at
home ” held at the Salon, the attendance was so
great that it bulged out of the door and kept the
lift-boy lively all the afternoon. There must have
been 300 women present and there were four men,
two of whom added to the gaiety of the afternoon
by singing dirgeful ballads. Lady Clarke, as
vice-president, has issued invitations for a conver-
sazione on Bth August, at Cliveden. The cards
bear the club badge, and all whose names appear
on the books as members or associates have been
bidden.

The Dacres having left Sydney, after a
run of most undeserved ill luck, George Hignold
resumed business at Her Alajesty’s, on Saturday,
with “Youth.” A larger audience than usual
assembled to witness this spectacle, which started
at 7.45, and got to the end of its eighth act some-
where in the vicinity of midnight. There is more
drama for the money in “Youth” than in any
other spectacle now devastating this country; it
fills time and space, and hangs over into eternity
like a dry tree sticking out over a withered land.
Also, it is strictly virtuous, after a certain primi-
tive fashion. There are no fine shades of character
in it; the haughty villain is exceedingly wicked
and lofty, and the coarse villain is a hairy gorilla
with a black eye, and the hero is an individual of
oppressive purity, and there i*v,also an Irishman,
who is resolved to be funny of “bust.” Pre-
sumably, he undergoes the latter painful operation
after the audience is gone. The eight scenes are
all new and beautiful. There are 200 or more
British troops in the piece, and they tight man-
fully with a few niggers in a red desert, and fire off
800 guns, more or less; and G. Hignold, who is
supposed to have gone off for help, is suddenly
found standing in the centre with the limelight
on him, and a tattered banner in his hand. An
impression is gaining ground that Mr. Hignold
sleeps with the limelight on him. Another act
reveals a soul-stirring riot in a prison, with con-
vict G. Hignold rescuing the warder from an awful
death ; and a third great scene is the departure of
the huge troopship with Private Hignold in a
conspicuous place on the upper deck. The earlier
acts show the downward career of Lieutenant
Hignold, and the last one of all shows the return
home of ex-private Hignold, Y. 0., and the sudden
collapse of all his enemies.
• • •
The very numerous G. Hignold, above
mentioned does Ins part, such as it is, very well,
especially when he departs on the horse in search
of reinforcements, and suddenly returns with both
hands full of limelight and flag. Soot Ihglis, as
the polished villain, fills a stereotyped part
sufficiently well. The same brilliant observation
applies to Sweeney’s stereotyped Irishman, and
Miss Knights’ stereotyped adventuress, and the
stereotyped parson, and many other people. Mr.
Plimmer is notable as a pleasant and manly officer
conhealed behind an unusually shiny eyeglass, and
Miss Maud Williamson is another adventuress
who is a little less stereotyped, and whose bright
smile shows up nicely against the background of
Gaffer Hodge’s tombstone in Act I.
• • #
It is alleged that Mr. Rignokl’s next pro-
duction will be a great religious drama, “Joseph
of Canaan.” If this refers to the Old Testament
Imro, The Bulletin respectfully suggests that
Mr, Hignold should be Joseph; Mr. Scot Inglis,
Potiphar ; and Mr. Plimmer, Pharaoh. Also, it
proposes _ that Air. Sweeney should be Father
Jacob, with a powerful Irish accent.

“ In Town,” at Sydney Lyceum, has done
better business so far than the “ Gaiety Girl,’’and
could last for another fortnight if wanted, to
judge by present appearances. Sydney, in this
matter, has followed the lead of Melbourne, which
also returned “In Town ” at the head of the poll
by a large majority. The Bulletin doesn’t even
profess to know the reason of this public fervor,
but, having decided that Brad field is not a suf-
ficient explanation, it sets it down to the comic
back-view of little Fred Kaye, as the call-boy, and
leaves the matter at that. The “ Shop Girl ” and
“ Gentleman Joe” are to follow at some period in
the remote future.

The two variety shows at the Tivoli and
Empire are getting along reasonably well, con-
sidering that Parkes and G. Heid have lately been
furnishing all tile variety that any sane and
healthy person could ask for, and that nearly
100 other persons have been carrying on in a truly
dreadful fashion, gratis, all over the city and
suburbs. The spectacle of a hoarse candidate
gyrating on a public-house balcony by the glare of
a slush-lamp on a windy night, and wildly pro-
mising everything to everybody, while bags of
flour explode on his bat, is calculate to draw the
audience away from the best variety-show that
ever existed.

Hamilton’s Circus is living up to its early
reputation. The card-playing pony is just getting
into form, and the bauds that be holds are quite
dreadful to see; also, when it is his deal, he turns
up a big trump with fiendish malignity. Some
very clever child-gymnasts have been added to
the programme; also a wrestling bear, who lately
induced one of the audience to join in a rough-
and-tumble encounter, and got badly knocked
out. The general impression is, however, that
the bear had been stiffened by the bookmakers.

“ Thoroughbred, ” otherwise Roast Chicken,
galloped very short at Melbourne Princess’s, and,
after Alonday night, the invisible animal was
turned out to grass. The Bulletin would ad vise
B. and B. bo sell their phantom steed, without
reserve, to somebody who can run him at small
country meetings. In the language of sporting
journalism, he comes in baked after getting a
gruelling, and the Hoast Chicken pot boils over.
As a dead bird, he is no good, except, for laying
purposes. But enough of the mythical quad-
ruped, “Mrs. Tanqueray” was announced to
appear on Tuesday, and stay four nights. The
admirers of Aliss Olliffe include everybody who
has an eye for the picturesque or a soul to be
thrilled, therefore the few opportunities of behold
ing that charming actress m the character of
Paula should attract much attention.

Harry Rickards took leave of Melb., at
the Opera House, on Monday, and is now crossing
the seas to engage new lots of variety artists. He
will be badly missed during his absence in foreign
parts. The boys have loved ’Arry for many
years, also their fathers loved him before they
were born, but he was never so generally doated
upon as now. The chorus of “’E dunno where ’e
are” trembled with emotion these last nights,
and its broken roar must have been audible in the
lower heavens. The great gap left by the retreat-
ing form of H. Rickards will be filled as much as
possible by Harry Dooley, who makes his first
appearance at the Opera House on Saturday.

A smoke-concert at the Melb. Bankers’
Institute last Thursday revealed the members of
a somewhat ’auglity calling in a genial light, and
was one of the best-arranged entertainments of the
kind that has happened to poor old Melbourne
since its deposits went into reconstruction.
Amateur talent expands under such treatment as
it receives from the elegantly-tailored bank
official in Ins social lair. Smoke-night perform-
ances seem to be improving steadily in quality.
Young Waxrnan’s imitations of Sass, Cecil Ward,
Tapley, Brough, Charles Norrie and Elton would
make a pretty big order for any professional
mimic to execute. A Liedertafel quintet party
are more than worth the listening to, although
they warble gratis, and the man with a yarn to
tell at a place where one is paid refreshments to
hear him is often a sound comedian. A novel
musical item on the Bankers’ programme was a
chorister-boy, who hit the sympathetic audience
on a tender spot with his young mezzo-soprano.
This was the same lad, Harold Fisher, who had
made a Cyril Tylerish success at the Town Hall
half-an-hour previously.
At Poverty Point,
Thus a very straighlspoken Bulletin correspondent—a
most competent critic, by the way—on Juliet Wray
Flegeltaub's) debut as Clairette with tbs W. and M.
Opera Co. at Adelaide. “With a handicap of ugly
features and no limbs or Aspire she simply brought down
the bouse, people in the stalls and dress-circle standing
up and shouting at the end of her song in the Hrst act
(‘Yes, I am the daughter of my mother,’ etc.). There
were two big encores and a third loudly demanded. A
novice who walks in and sweeps the floor with N Hie s
record as a vocalist is an artist even in this puritan city.
More ugly than otherwise, with a not too sympathetic
voice, she, by dint of a certain vim and magnetism,
achieved a triumph such as I've only heard once before,
and that was achieved by the refined and charming little
Deoima Moore in the same part. “Madame Angot ”
seems a lucky operetta to debut in. Flo. Young made
her biggest hit as Madame Lange.
A London correspondent paints the Dacres’ poor recep-
tion in Melb. as discouraging to other artists. But Aus-
tralia mirrors London, fair or unfair. Take the Gaiety,
on the other hand. In these dark days people will only
endure a show that amuses them. They will not stand
instruction, or moral lessons. They don’t want dramatic
beef and beer, but only oysters and champagne.
Herbert Flemming was a member of Mrs. Langtry’s co.
at latest dates. Wonder if the now' full-blown Lily re-
gards Herbert with the eyes of another actress who
described him as having “a godlike face”?
Dear Bulletin, —Your correspondent, Ah Gie, persists
in speaking of Miss Varley's “ secession ” from the W. and
M Opera Co. She was under engagement, to the Firm at
the time of her death, an engagement which would have
lasted until the middle of next year.—An Boon.
An Australienne, writing privately from London, says of
Melba’s singing in “ Faust “She lias a divine voice.
Each note is perfect, as perfect and pure as silence, if you
can understand. You can’t imagine her singing out of
tune, or fl it, or sharp, or harsh, and it rings through the
enormous Covent Garden, so that even when she is sing-
ing gotto voce you hear every note distinctly. Patti can’t
touch her, hut as an actress you simply can’t criticise her.
She doesn't act. I never saw a woman so devoid of ex-
pression and charm. Not a touch of magnetism. That
is what prevents her taking her right place at the very
top of the tree. In the dungeon scene, where she clasps
Faust and sings “ Oui,c’est toi I Je t’aime / ” she might
have been singing “That’s a pretty necktie.” Faust was
the handsome Alvarez. He took his top-note in the
garden-scene exquisitely and so fulfilled his mission. But
Plaocon ! Imagine a French Mephislopheles singing (in
his native tongue) like an angel, acting.like the very
devil, and pacing about like a panther in beautiful scarlet
tights (not that I ever saw a panther in tights). That's
Plancon, every lime. He is the best M. in the world. The
Blew de ior was superb. lam quite ashamed of myself
for not getting tired of Faust. 1 never shall.”
The show in which Lonnen and Alice Lethbridge were
shining lights went suddenly hung bef >re the last English
mail left. It seems that a new lady, Miss Ada Heeve, was
brought into rivalry with the Lethbridge, and awful ruc-
tions used to happen behind the scenes. Alice Leth. has
more than an average share of the jealousy which seems
inseparable from a business where success demands noisy
applause. She went into hysterics at Melb. Princess’s
when Mary Weir, for one memorable night only, broke a
promise not to dmce the serpentine whirl in fleshings.
Alice couldn’t display her own scraggy outlines, and
objected to the shapely Mary scoring in her stead.
Marshall Hall lias given publicity to adroll story against
a Melb. musical critic. Toe yarn has it that the news-
paper man, after hearing Madame Wiedermann sing the
same song twice at Halid’s concert the other Saturday,
went into Hie greenroom to enquire “ what the song
might be that madaine sang in response to her recall.”
People will note something more than an astounding joke
in this little incident. It is well for them to hear that a
free and independent “critic” is one who pays friendly
visits to the performers he is supposed to know only as
public artists,
~Boucicaull is wise to give “ Mrs. Tanqueray,” with Miss
Olliffe in the name-part, a chance of improving biz. at
Melb. Princess’s, although there is little hope for any-
thing, however good, produced during the coldest of B.
and B. seasons.
Every now and then Miss Faber is a striking reminder
of Mrs. Brough. The resemblance seems to be in the cut
of the head and neck, the set of the features, and one or
two tricks of expression.
An American damsel has adopted the toothsome stage-
name of Tartie Frightling. Not long ago a Gaiety girl
brought an action against a weekly journal in which she
had been casually described as a “ lari." The other little
charmer has no absurd scruples, evidently. We call her
little advisedly. She must he petite—little Tartie, and
real jam.
Contributions to the memorial to the late Lucy Cham-
bers—tlie most popular Australian singing teacher of her
time—have rolled in generously. It has been decided to
place a plain stone cross over Lucy’s resting-place, and to
devote the rest of the funds to found a memorial bed in
the Women’s Hospital. A most excellent way of keeping
the famous singer’s memory green.
Ada Crossley, it is said, would he quite disheartened by
her rehutfs but for Melba’s encouragement.
It is extremely plain, from certain recent Melb, events,
that no one who leaches music for a living should he
, allowed to act as musical critic tor the press. “No man
is a competent judge in iiis own cause ” —or in that of his
professional rivals.
Geraldine Olliffe’s engagement with the B. and B. co.
is only for six months, and will expire in Sept. "Tis likely,
■though, that it will be renewed till Xmas, when Mrs.
Brough is due to re-appear with the co.
Melba, on her meal-method : “I take about the same
thing every day in the year— cafi au lait, mutton-chops,
beefsteak, greens, fruit, and light wine, I never touch
cereals, bread, potatoes, pastry, or candy. I eat. fruit
three times a day. I only eat broiled meat, and I take it
with salad. I never drink anything cold, and as I don’t
fancy cooked water, 1 live on coffee, tea, and wine.”
Boucicault is making extensive preparations to sump-
tuously stage Haddon Chambers’ new piece, “John a-
Dreams,” at Melb. Princess’s. In one act there is a
panoramic scene, and in order to paint the scene properly
Melb. Exhibition Building had to he taken. Also,
“Boucy ” intends trying some new lighting-effects of his
own devising.

Sawyer, the Tory who last week called
John Burns a liar, and lost sundry teeth in the
scuffle, is a valet. Most British valets are Tories,
somehow. So, as a rule, are footmen, butlers—

Sawyer will probably be pensioned by the Prim-
rose League.
The political revival of Lord Salisbury
inadvertently saved the Vic. Government a thou-
sand pounds. Hopetoun has accepted a nominal
billet in the new Ministry, and on the strength of
this hollow distinction he retired from his peculiar
position of Vic. Gov. on leave of absence and half-
pay. Satisfactory to know that Victoria’s gain is
not Great Britain's loss. Hopetoun’s seat in the
Cabinet has no salary hanging to it, but it is
sufficiently a sear to disqualify him from catrying
a scandalous farce any further. For the present,
and until Brassey swears in, Victoria has no
official deity, merely a ghostly imitation.

The Union Bank of Australia declares a divi-
dend for the half-year at the rate of 5 percent, per annum.
Last half-year the rale was C per cent., the one before it
was 8, in ’92 the rate was as hitch as 12 per cent.,
and seven years ago it stood at 14. The reserve-fund
Blands at the same figure (£1,000,000) as it did seven years
ago, the policy of the hank in recent years having been to
pay away practically all its earnings to shareholders. Con-
sequently, despite its acknowledged solidity, its dividends
have fallen heavily, and whether the end of the fall has
been reached is still uncertain.

That steady and methodical little concern, the
Ballarat Banking Co., has made a net profit of 4.3449,
against £3710 for the previous half-year, which, with
£28720n hand, makes £Bl2l available for distribution.
It pays its usual div. at the rale of 5J per cent, per
annum on its capital of £85,000 (£2337) and adds £l5OO
to reserve, which now stands at £50,000. The reserve, it
may’ be mentioned, lias increased by £9OOO since the
beginning of ’93. The Ballarat Bank lias cash and
Government debentures equal to 33 per cent, of its
liabilities—the best record among the purely Victorian
banks.

the lot. Four banks and two in trance societies were
among the tenderers, and each ba k wanted to take the
whole £lO,OOO. The A.M.P. gels £4 7s. per cent, on its
investment, which, considering the security, shows that
the struggle for any kind of interest-paying stock is a
pretty hard one just now.

The system of accepting deposit-receipts (bought

at he biggest discount.

The N.S.W. Mont de about the steadiest
investment in the province, lias a net profit of £4239 (as
compared with £4470 last half-year), and £753 brought

£4992. The usual div. at 10 per cent, per annum absorbs
£3581 ; £5OO goes to reserve, making it £12,000 ; £l5O to
contingency fund to cover possible depreciation of securi-
ties, making it £6374; and £761 is carried forward.
Altogether the half-yearly report of the Mont de l’i6t<s

One Brown, a Melbourne accountant, giving
evidence before the Vic. Hanking Commission, stated
that £43,000,000 were lent out by the banks in Victoria,
and the average rate of interest was “at least 8 per
cent.” The banks get this money from the public at not
over 4 per cent, on an average, and lend it to the public
at double that price, and yet they can’t live on the dif-
ference. A State Land Bank, under even decent manage-
ment, could borrow at the same rate, and lend on
agricultural land up to half its value at 5 per cent., and
make about as much profit out of the transaction as the
private hanks do. It would not have to maintain 13
boards of directors, 13 boss managers, 13 big head offices,
13 different s'affs, and as many different sets of branch
offices with branch managers and staffs to match; it
would not require to advertise on the extensive scale the
present banks do in order to attract customers; and it
would not need to charge extia rates to make up for losses
on other classes of business, for it would not he driven
by competition to take risky business. The people who
borrow' from the private banks pay for all the 13
big head offices, and all the rest of the gorgeousness, and
the bad debts, and the advertising, and Hie oilier circum-
stances. Brown makes the eminently sensible suggestion
that the State should take over from the hanks all their
agricultural inorlages, and become responsible for an
equal amount of their deposits, and thus start the Slate
Land Bank right off. Then it could, in consideration of
the extra security afforded, convert the deposits into
Jong-dated 3.J per cents., and, in the case of depositors
who wouldn’t convert, it could pay them off and get new
ones in their stead. With the saving in interest and
working expenses it could reduce mortgage interest im-
mediately to 6 per cent, all round and yet leave a large
margin to cover any losses through had business taken
over, and when the bad business was nil liquidated it
con’d make a further reduction to 5 per cent, without
difficulty. This is about the most practical and business-
like idea up to date.

crowd ” behind him, has been experimenting on various
Broken Hill sulphides, and claims to have discovered an
inexpensive ohemieal that will 1 ach out the zinc from
merely crushed ore. But he will give no details; it is
doubtful, in fact, if he will (rust the Patents Office with
ills secret. Arrangements are proceeding for the erection
of a plant at the South (8.H.) mine capable of treating
100 tons daily.
♦ * * *
The North mine (8.H.) has changed hands for
the fifth time. The only people who have made money
out of it are those who hare bought it to sell. The
original co. was in 80,000 £1 shares ; the New North had
£l shares. The latter erected expensive but
lumbering coimentratiiig works to deal with ttie car-
bonates, but s mt them down, and long ago the
mill was partly dismantled. Apart from a few patches
of rich cupriferous carbonates, got at 200 ft., little has
been exposed in the mine Iml low-grade sulphides and
some very low-grade carbonates. At 300 ft. they pro-
spected most extensively, but most unsuccessfully ;
though there is still some ground W'est to fossick in. The
cute “ South crowd ” is, however, now standing by the
new venture, which has a nominal capital of £lOO,OOO,
and proposes to see what can be done with Hie sulphides.
Mr. J. B. Gluyas, general manager of the
Broken Hill South, wishes it to be known, in reference to
a statement recently printed, that lie has no intent ion
whatever of retiring from Iris present position, and is
much annoyed at Hie dissemination of such a rumor.

Latest Westralian mining manager’s report :
“We have, for the week, mended Hie windlass and
erected a new grindstone.”
A Coolgardie correspondent: “Re Great
Boulder. Last time I saw the mine I recognised that
they had a lot of told ore, but never gave it credit for
lasting so long, and never entertained any idea of the
crowd being able to “ boost ”up the shares to £4. There
is no doubt their luck in striking a rich reef in‘time
shafts ’ is nothing less than phenomenal.
“I went out lately to see a mine a good many
miles from Coolgardie, and would not have exchanged
nr bools for the show. A few days ago it was sold for
£7OOO. Another riiiu J was put under offer to a middle-
man tor £4500. He brings out a buyer who approves at
£7OOO, pays £750 deposit, £3OO of which goes to Mr.
Middleman, who, on completion of sale, drew £2200
further commission. You cannot approach anyone about
the sale of a mine without his wanting a big slice of the
plunder.
“Coolgardie is a great place on Sunday night.
As I write I can hear church services, the Salvation Army
band, the theatre concert, and a crowd of 1500 excited
men yelling around the Comma office lor M'Cann, the
Lake Cowan fool who has been looked up by the police for
his own safety.”

Re Great Boulder (Hannan’s): “The best gold
ever raised is coming from the south drive at the 100 ft.
level, 800 ft. from the main shaft, the reef being continuous
all the way r . The winze below the 100 ft. is down 60ft.
The stone is simply glistening with line gold. The niin •
becomes more phenomenal as it is opened up." Of
Bayley’s nothing is said ; overshadowed by Great Boulder.
A mine had better be born poor and become rich than
vice versa.

Lindsay’s (Coolgardie): “Tests show small pro-
spects ; reef, 3ft., 18in. of which is composed of pyrites
and quartz. Samples show free gold in small quantities.”

it’s the original course of the old Madame Berry lead,

“Jack” Lyall, the well-known legal manager
of Launceston, has just been prosecuted in the local
police-court on a charge of forging a transfer of scrip In
the West Volunteer P.A., which, until lately, he managed.
The charge arises out of the recent West V. scandal in
which the cutting of the lode with paying stone was
“ hushed ” for a few days to the benefit of the few in the
“know.” A few shares were distributed amongst em-
ployes at the mine—it has byen.said for hush purpose—
and quite recently one of them applied to the Supreme
Court for a rectification of tire register on discovering
that his name was not there. It then transpired that the
shares given him had been transferred by a foreign signa-
ture purporting to he Ids, and that he had not received
any of the divs. declared during his shareholding. Re-
sult—the recent prosecution eventuating in Lyall's com-
mittal for trial. For the defence it is urged that the
shares were only given to enable donee to attend and
vote at a particular meeting, and were re-transferred by
his purported signature—that such proceedings are usual
in such cases and, in the present instance, were, like Vic.
ex-members’ use of defunct passes “ without intent to
defraud.”

long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion cf
peach and ivory may be had by anyone--who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

N.S. W ales Premier
Reid, at a big meeting
last week, said he had

with such enthusiasm that

In retiring from that very

added, fervently, “ God
bless you ! ” When actor
Elliston produced a mimic
coronation at Drury Lane
just after the accession of
Geo. IV., Elliston him-
self impersonated the

actually came to believe
himself a real King.
“ Bless you, my people ! ”
he exclaimed. So far,

won’t take much notice of Wise until the latter
becomes as fat as he (Reid) is. There’s a lot in
this. The besotted public really think a man

monstrously hairy. They worship Beam, not
Brain. All the same, Wise would probably sen’c
nearly as much as Reid. Wind doesn’t weigh.

Rosebery had it in his head to provide a

Sometimes a man is a prophet in his own
country. The Goulburn Valley, of which district
he is a native, is very proud of “ Breaking-the-

propose to give him a public welcome. Seeing
that he brings to them neither cheap money nor a
reduction in rents this is very good of them.
The Gipps Ward (Sydney) election-oppon-
ents, Dan. O’Connor and George Black, were the
most prominent figures at the first Sydney recep-
tion of Sarah Bernhardt. Daniel distinguished
himself, in addressing the Divine Sarah, by placing
a very improper accent on the final vowel of
“belle;” while Black was the only man in the
assemblage who had the nerve to publicly kiss
Sarah’s hand.
The weakest form of vanity is that of the
newspaper-man who inflicts his own portrait upon
his readers. S. V. Winter—who is old enough to
know better—has just done this in the weekly
satellite of Melb. Herald. It is more than
usually unpardonable in Samuel’s case, because he
is not lovely. Years of bad temper, caused by
futile endeavors to read his own handwriting,
have quite spoilt his beauty.
S.A. Govt, still hankers for tidings of
the Bublic Trustee who, years ago, cleared out
with about .£15,000 and is supposed to lie a
grandee in Mexico. He really deserved success.
Before he left he took the official advice of the
late Crown Solicitor Mann, Q!c., as to what
countries had no extradition-treaties with Great
Britain. He was advised that Mexico was one,
and promptly steamed off there.
In Sydney, the other night, ex-Premier
Barkes publicly accused Bremier Reid of “delud-
ing” Governor Hopetonn, of Victoria, into accept-
ing an invitation to a farewell-dinner at Sydney,
in order that he (Hopetonn) might, on reaching
England, he induced to advocate Reid’s claims to
a knighthood'! The envious old “statesman”
cannot open his month without making it plain
that Imperial baubles are his gods.
Premier Reid says he was “ only a boy in
the gallery” when Edmund Butler, Q.C., was
denied the N.S.W, Chief Justiceship by Barkes.
Mr. Reid is now 50, and Butler and Barkes quar-
relled in Nov., 73. This would make the “ boy
Reid ” just 28 years of age oh that eventful night.
When the present N.S.W. Bremier was 28 he was
corresponding clerk in the Treasury and a shining
light in Sydney School of Arts Deflating Club.
Dear Bulletin, —Now that
old man Barkes seems discredited in
the eyes of Australians, I wish to
mention that over 50 years ago a
wild young mare, which he had
borrowed from my father, bucked
something awful with him, and
jumped a dog-leg fence on Home-
bush racecourse, and that old (then
young) Barkes rode her like
and sat like a rock. This is all I
can say in his favor—and it is much
—now that he is down in the
world ; but it would have been
painting the lily to mention it
when he was “ Brirne Minister.” —

William Tarleton, the tedious veteran
Hobart B.M. who dropped dead in the street
whilst returning from church, was 75 years of age,
and had been on the bench since his arrival in Tas-
mania in 1842. As Assistant-B.M. he sat, for a
time, in company with the notorious John Brice-
then B.M. at Hobart. Tarleton, though a
strict disciplinarian, in the early days did much
towards lightening many of the tyrannies of the
system.
One of Williamson and Musgrove’s living-
picture models has, The Bulletin hears, just
become the spouse of a 22-year-old Melb. johnny.
The lady, a native of the Southern city, will lie
remembered as having outshone in face and form
all the remaining poseuses of the show, both im-
ported and home-made. The bridegroom is the
heir of one of the oldest (white) Vic. families, and
his possessions, transmuted into ready cash, would
probably run into five figures several times over,
even at present values.
Just listen to J. Gavan Duffy talking at
the Vic. Humane Society’s distribution of awards :
“Those who receive the society’s awards should
be as proud as if they bent the knee at Windsor
to receive the honor of knighthood from Her
Majesty the Queen.” And this from the son of
the Duffy who was a rebel “to his backbone and
spinal marrow” at one stage of bis career, who
accepted the “honor of knighthood” later on.
and who still accepts a pension from the Vic.
Govt. John Gavan Duffy should have just a Htt i
mercy on his poor old father.

Mr. J. W. DICKINSON.
Mr. J. W. Dickinson, runner-rip to Mr.
Coni on in the N.S.W. bowling championship
matches, proven his quality by beating .39 ardent
competitors. He is a native of Sydney, andl
stands in the first rank of Australian bowlers.
He played for the Glebe in ’94 in the first cham-
pion rink (against all clubs), and materially con-
tributed to his team’s victory. He lias been a
most successful captain in matches between
N.S. W. and Victoria and Maoriland; and was
playing for the Glebe club when it won, three
years in succession, the “John Young trophy.’’
He also won the intercolonial championship
medal against Victoria. Mr. Dickinson is Mr,
Conlon’s brother-in-law, so there must surely be
a favorable bias in bowling relationship.
A recent Australasian contained a poem
by Adam Lindsay Gordon, entitled “The Feud.’’
It was given as previously unpublished, but editor
Bonython, of Adelaide Observer, printed it in a
London literary paper some years ago. The Aus-
tralasian editor expressed doubt as to whether it
is a genuine Gordon relic or not. The doubt
was unnecessary. It was written by Gordon at
Mt. Gambler in 1863, shortly after the publication
of the pictures of Baton (subsequently Sir Noel
Baton), one of which formed its subject, and was
the first original composition of any length pro-
duced by the Centaur poet. It was thought so
well of by his friends that, sorns time afterwards,
he had 50 copies of it printed at the office of the
Border Watch, in Albury, for private circula-
tion. Gordon did not, however, think it of
sufficient merit to be included in his published,
poems. And his judgment was correct.

The present S.A. Parliament distances all
previous records for solid jaw. Recently legisla-
tors talked for a whole week—sole result, motion
for a polling-place carried.
One Ridley Smith, a Queenslander (all
Queenslanders who live in England are Tories),
opposed John Burns at the British general elec-
tion, and polled within 259 of him.
Ere ten years, The Bulletin predicts, it
will be an all-Australian democratic axiom that
no man holding an Imperial title shall ever be
returned to any House of Assembly. .
The first par. which meets the eye in a
recent copy of the Sydney Socialist organ
“Readers of the Socialist, support only the
business people who advertise in this paper.”
“State railways cannot pay.” Yet up in
the land where Transcontinental M‘llwraith made
the above assertion, one State railway, the
Northern, has just paid an annual div. of 9 per
cent., and promises to pay 10 next year. Where
is the syndicate-ruled line of 250 miles which can
show a similar return ?
The Argus proves con-
clusively that because pro-
tected mills used 40 per
cent, of cotton in certain
“ woollen ” goods, therefore
Protection is a failure. It
naturally follows on . the
statement of the National
Wool Co. of Australia, that
as one Yorkshire firm, under
Freetrade, makes tweed with
100 per cent, of shoddy—
Fret trade is 60 per cent, more
of a failure than Protection.
The Pariiamen tary com-
mittee appointed in England
to consider the importation
of foreign prison-made goods,
lias discovered some curious
facts. In the Belgian pri-
sons thousands of convicts
are employed at mat-making.
Owing to the economical
mode of working, their
goods can be sold in Free-
trade England at half, the
price of the locally-made
article, despite the low
wages paid in the dear old
mother country. In the
last five years these Belgian
gaol - products have taken
such effectual possession of
the market that the sales in
London alone are now equal
to .£4OOO a week. Even the
mats sold in English blind-
asylums, as the work of the
inmates, are often secretly
imported from the Belgian
gaols! In 1870, the Eng-
lish mat-makers not only
supplied the local market
but did a large export trade;
now the industry is almost
extinct. It is suggested
that “diplomatic pressure
should be brought to bear
on Belgium to prevent the
export of gaol-made goods.
“Diplomatic pressure’’isPro-
tection under another name.
The reductions in Vic. Customs duties
don’t seem to be tending to an Argus “revenue
tariff ” The real revenue-tariff which Victoria is
coming to will take the form of a graduated land-
tax.
Dow, of Victoria, lately moved a cordial
vote of thanks to the Argus for the services it had
rendered to Protection by opposing it. Next day
the Argus briefly stated that Dow was a circus
clown.”
Rumored, in London, that Mr Seppy
Stephen—haw'.—is to succeed N.S.W. Agent-

In a pamphlet B. R. Wise states that
Premier Reid, when forming his present Cabinet,
offered him the post of Colonial Treasurer, which
was declined. Had Wise accepted, Reid would
be Colonial Secretary, and where would Brunker
be ?

Hypocrisy in excels!s! The British Govt,
wanted to enquire into the Turkish massacres in
Armenia, the other day. Yet Gov. Loch was
laughed at when he wanted an enquiry, some
time ago, into the exploits of the S. African
Chartered Co. in M itabeleland.
The Melb. Coffee Palace intriguers for
alcohol regard Premier Turner as their enemy,
holding professionally so many briefs for the hotel
interest. He was in a mighty hurry to pass hi?
very first bill for the publican relief in regard to
transfers, but waves off the Coffee Palace barmaid.
Apropos of the Queensland agitation for
Electoral Reform and voters’ rights. Twenty
years ago voters’ rights were issued in
Queensland and the system worked well. The
measure, however, was passed by a Conservative
Ministry and its Liberal successors wrathful!/
repealed it.
An ex-Premier, who is also a K.C.M.G.,

And how beastly unfamiliar is the rest of the
paragraph !

The Amalgamated Society of Engineers

Rider Haggard was ill-advised enough to

A bill iiow before Maoriland Parliament
provides that no debt shall be legally recoverable
after it has been two years outstanding, ano that
no debt under for goods sold and delivered
sb.'llb., ~e c „.e , „bl„ by H-.l «o>"-
Bathgate, of Maoriland, used to advocate that no
debt should be recoverable at law, on the giound
that “the State is not a debt-collector, and the
majority of the community not be taxed
for the. maintenance of civil courts in order that a
minority may do risky business.” ihings are
moving that way.
One of the triumphs of Maoriland Trea-
surer Ward is that he has been able (subject to
the ratification of the two Parliaments concerned)
to negotiate a reciprocity treaty between Maori-
land and Canada. Thus a Protectionist country
is found to be like a prudent man, who has con-
served his estate and is able to barter portion ot
his accumulated wealth for some of the goods ot
equally prudent neighbors across the way. But
the Freetrade country into winch the loreign-
traders would convert N.S.W. is like a Juggins
BOLD ENOUGH.
NEW-CHUM : “ The, finest mart

who has already turned over his fortune to the
greedy maws of all the rooks, hawks, and vultures
who swarm around Ins carcase. Again, a Protec-
tionist country is like a maiden set off with a
handsome “dot; ” vyhile a Freetrade land is a
deflowered woman without a dower.
Zox, the Vic. Freetrade politician who
1 1 wavs*wears the white waistcoat of a blameless
,fe complained bitterly that the extra penny duty
~n ’candles “raised the price to the poor con-
Mimer ” But when the Protectionists demanded
the removal of the penny duty on coffee, on tlie
ground that it couldn’t be grown in the country
and only raised the price to the consumer, he rose
in protest: “No one would feel a penny per lb.,
said Zox. The Freetrader only worries about the
poor consumer when there is danger of a duty
helping along some local industry.
The courteous N.S.W, ex-Premier Parkes
on his hated enemy, Premier Reid : “Blunderingly
arrogant of soul, and one of the most contemptible
toadies that ever existed, he thinks of naught,
this vain, inglorious, brainless man, save
the advancement of a creature named George
Reid.” Also : “ They might as well call for tluee
cheers for a baboon as for Mr. Reid ; in George
Reid they had a clown—(groans)—who was de-
stroying their liberties. He could not speak at
length, but he would give his assurance—(a voice;
‘ You are an old fraud.’)” Mr. Barton : You
cowardiy scoundrel.” Henry Parkes : ‘ He was
a scoundrel. (Cheers and groans.) It was ever
thus,” etc., etc.
The Abrahams brothers, lately convicted
of fraudulent trading by a Melbourne jury, are
said to have made thousands of pounds in their
time out of legitimate transactions with the Vic.
Government. Although the business was scan-
dalous, the discredit of it rests upon the other
people iu this instance. The Abrahams firm used
to buy up from the Vic. Defence Dept, all the
“ obsolete ” rifles discarded by the local army, and
sell them again in England at a big profit. Each
time the arms of the precious forces were brought
up to date the old weapons were disposed of tor
“a song ” to the local jobbers, instead of being
shipped, at a fair market price, to a foreign gun-
factory.
One “J. C. Rounding” points out, in
Sydney Evening News, that Britain, which is a
Ereetrade country, lias largely reduced its public
debt, while France, Germany, Austria, Russia
and Italy, all ot which are heavily protected, are
piling up their State liabilities alarmingly. Ihe
other side of the story is that Britain paid on its
debts with almost the same energy while it was a
protected country ; that the United States, which
is also protected, lias reduced its liabilities even
faster than Britain ; while Turkey and sundry
Spanish-American republics have practised Iree-
tiade, and have piled up big debts and then gone
broke. And neither set of tacts proves anything,
after all.
Extract from report of election-meeting
held by a Sydney preacher named Bennett
Anderson :
Mr. Anderson, wfio spoke from a table placed outside a
coffee palace, did not wait for a chairman, but began his
address at once. He had not, he said, entered upon the
campaign with much spirit, because he would not be tree
from the ifcthel until next week, and as he was suffering
from a severe cold be would not be able to address them
very often or at great length, but be would reach them
all through the post. . . He was the nominee of the
Local Option League and the Good Templars, and if re-
turned would devote his spare time to the work of tem-
perance and of the churches. . .
A heavy shower of rain caused the meeting to terminate
suddenly.
The irony of Nature !
H. : “ The regulation thing in England
nowadays is six years for a strong Cabinet, and
apparently the new one may reckon on it.
Chamberlain is the only prominent member who
is a Liberal. Hartington and Goscheu are as
much Tories as Salisbury. Chamberlain has not
got what he wanted. He will quarrel with Ins
colleagues, and slide out of the Cabinet. Mean-
while, Asquith will shape up as leader of the
Radicals, for Hareourt and Morley have achieved
as much as they ever wilt. The demand of the
time will evoke some really popular democrat to
the fore someone as yet unknown. Chamberlain
will yet grapple with Ballour. 1 hey are essen-
tially different men. Balfour is an aristocrat,
while Chamberlain only plays his cards, and has no
faith in the royalty show.”
Victorian : “ Tlie coming battle, Argus v.
Age, is for the Moderate Protectionist vote.
There is hardly any Vic. Freetrade-party, either
in Parliament or the country. The Argus is not
Freetrade, hut its watchword is—No Prohibition,
and it is chilly to N.S.W. Premier Reid. Imagine
how the Argus would have tackled such a crisis,
20 years ago, with doses of the dead and buried
Bastiat and Mill! ”
Premier Reid’s 4;aunt that his critic,
Edmund Barton (to whom he had given an acting
Supreme Court Judgeship), was showing gross in-
gratitude in politically assailing him, was a huge
mistake and altogether the biggest slip made by
anybody during the N.S.W. general election.
Barton’s reply—“ If he did not give it because he
thought me the best man, then he must have given
it for some other motive ’’—is unanswerable.
When the
S.A. election
(pomes on next

accumulated
hatred of the
local Fat Man
for Premier
Kingston will
break forth in
eggs and exe-
cration. And

any idea how
unutterably

Fat of the pro-
vince—all the
loathing that
was ever enter-
tained for

D i b bs and

into one great

hardly equal it.
Hopes are en-
tertained in
quarters where

ered together,
that the woman

tained in Maoriland, and proved m > < rly fallacious.
As one Conservative candidate tiiere pathetically
remarked when the numbers went up : “A nice
mess you’ve made of it with your Woman Suf-
frage.”
Dear Bulletin, —Be Michael Davitt's con-
tention that fear of capital punishment deters
only those nervous people who do not need deter-
rence, the nervously-constituted man-impelled
by an emotional storm to a violent act is un-
questionably much more oblivious of consequences
than the cold-blooded contemplator of murder,
who would, therefore, most experience whatever
deterrent effect there might be in the prospect of
retributorv killing. Nervousness, in any case, is
so carefully discriminated by psychologists from
cowardice that Lewes calls it “in many instances
merely the reflex index of the temperament which
is capable, upon emergency, of the highest courage
of all.”— Speculum.
Some of the Victorian importers now feel
very sorry they spoke in the matter of locally-
manufactured shoddy. If the proposal that all
goods fie stamped according to their quality, under
severe penalties for deception, be carried, it will
matter comparatively little so far as local goods
are concerned, seeing that the Vic. factories are
within reach of the law and can be kept up to the
mark. But the English and German shoddy-
makers being out of reach, the responsibility of
their deceptions will rest on the importer, who is
the man within gunshot range of the statutes.
Moreover, if the law is enforced, even reasonably
well, there will be such an awful exposure of the
import shoddy business as was never heard of
before. And the intention of the importers was
simply to expose the local makers ; the idea of
being exposed themselves is altogether new.
The Wellington (M.L.) Evening Post
fossil breaks out again ;
Mr. Joyce’s Elective Governors Bill was x noxious
political weed, and we are glad it was promptly trampled
on. We 011I3’ wish some means could be devised of killing
the root of such measures, so that they should never again
spring: up to taint the political atmosphere with a foul
flavor of disloyalty and imperial disintegration. Instead
of desiring to see our powers of self-Government extended
by the right to elect a Governor in the colony, we would
prefer to s i, e the whole too elaborate machinery of Con-
stitutional Government swept away and the powers of
real Government entrusted to the hands of a competent
Imperially-appointed Governor. The advent of_ an elec-
tive Governor would be the signal for all who desire to live
under a system of Government guaranteeing the security
of life and property to clear out of Republican New
Zealand.
The “foul flavor of Imperial disintegration” is
especially good.

Womanhood Suffrage does not exist in
N.S. W., yet at the ’94 election one member
of “the other sex” recorded her vote—at one of
the outside polling-places of Glen Innes electorate.
Her husband was ill, so she took his “right” and
marched bravely off to the ballot-box. The poll-
clerk at first refused to accept the vote, but
madame argued him into believing that, as the
husband couldn’t attend, she was perfectly eligibl;
to represent him. The upshot was that member
Wright got the benefit of the only female vote yet
taken in the province

The Vic. Acting-Governoress is a potentate
to suit the times. Ever so many melancholj
dressmakers wrote to her to say their trade was
languishing for want of encouragement at head-
quarters. So she devised a fancy-dress ball for
next month at which it is imperative that every-
one shall wear fancy clothes. She has had many
letters from designers, costumieres, &c., saying
that the idea has not only helped them but let
them employ a large number of out-of-work
seamstresses.

Dear Bulletin, —The dead set now being
made in Melbourne against the Bicycle Woman
is, I think, to be explained by the Queen of Spain
legend. Right-thinking persons consider it inde-
cent for a woman (off the stage) to make public
the fact that she has legs. There is a fortune
waiting for the man who will invent a side-saddle
bicycle. The New Woman will not, of course,
patronise it, her ardent desire being to evolve legs.
By the way, is it not curious that, in spite of
physiology, man always gives his sculptured or
painted ideal wom«n small-r heads and longer legs
than the average natural woman possesses? The
Venus de Medici has the longest body and short-
est legs of all the Greek female statues —and even
then they are longer than those of the modern
average female. It cannot, I think, be impressed
upon woman too strongly that she is an absurdly
short-legged animal, and that her salvation lies in
skirts.— Creevk Roe.

Dear Bulletin, —He is the small imper-
tinent son of a near relative, and is allowed Aus-
tralian liberties. He chips in the conversation of
the eldors and occasionally enlightens them. Frin-
stance : we were discussing the eternal female as
now manifested, and deploring her scramble for
the pants. “My word, she wouldn’t want ’em if
she went to our school,” said the small boy. and
he sat very feelingly on the extreme edge of his
chair and sighed. There is a soul of good in things
evil—even skirts. — Snell.

Dear Bulletin, — I saw the New Woman
15 years ago in the Tumut Ranges. She was
carrying a heavy swag, and her husband, who
followed her, carried a pipe in his mouth. I asked
them to take some billy-tea I was making at the
time. Both sit down. The man said, “ Chuck
over that swag,” The woman chucked it, and he
placed it under his head, and, stretching himself
out at full length, remarked, “Now, mate, I call
this comfortable.” The New Woman of these
present years doesn’t seem to know what a rod she
is putting in pickle for herself, —C.R.

Lady Hopetoun’s cousin, Mr.
lias become engaged to a daughter of the late
Salmon Wilson ; almost simultaneously with thC
promulgation of this announcement comes the
news that, under their deceased father’s will, the
Wilson girls get .£50,000 each. Miss Wilson (Mr.
Ralston’s hride-elect) is .a pale, somewhat diminu-
tive damsel, demurely “English’’ in deportment
and dress, and with so little love for things Aus-
tralian that she only consented to the recent
Ercildonne sojourn for health reasons.
* *
The traditional coolness between th°
Hopetouns and a certain tomboy heiress is said
to have originated at one of the first up-country
meets patronised by their Excellencies. To beguile
the preliminary wait, the frisky damsel in question
joined the men of the house-party in a friendly
game of leap-frog on the verandah, to the intense
enjoyment of all concerned. When the fun was
at its height, the Countess suddenly quitted her
post of observation, and, .addressing her hostess in
icy tones, requested to be driven to the station as
she wished to go home. And home she went, the
prayers and tears of the assemblage notwith-
standing. Lady Hopetoun never forgot this
episode, and in after years when a polo hall was
being arranged in the vicinity of her favorite
summer residence, she warned the invitation com-
mittee to choose between herself and the dashing
culprit aforesaid.
The cable announces that Gov. Brassey
and his wife are “eager to give their hearts’ pros-
perity and happiness for the elevation of the
people.” Which means just as much and as little
as if he said that he was prepared to saorifice the
hereditary perspective of his liver in order to pro-
mote the habit of making clear soup out of gum-
trees. Is there no such thing in existence as a
plain, sensible Governor, who won’t make a fool
of himself by waving a maudlin and incoherent
fork at banquets, but will simply state that he is
going to draw his salary regularly, and sign all
needful State documents in a legible hand, and
make himself as agreeable as circumstances will
permit ?

A Melb. ladies' school got up some scenes
from Shakespeare in aid of a local charity, and
the manageress stipulated that not a single ticket
should be sold to an unmarried man. One im-
posing pater-familias represented the male element
in the audience. All went well but dismally till
the stage-director, for the purposes of illusion,
began to burn a pale-blue, harmless light—as he
thought. It turned out to be a strong compound
of sulphur. In a moment the stage was blotted
out, and the crowd of ladies, all in full evening-
dress and in closely-packed rows, found them-
selves in a thick, yellow-black cloud. Strug-
gling, spluttering, thinking they were all
going to be burnt -to death, they fell over
one another pell-mell, tearing each other’s
dresses, and getting mixed up in each
other’s ornamental combs, as th y fought their
way out of doors. Then the cry went up from
the hearts of all the pretty school damsels— “ Oh
for a man ! ’ For paterfamilias had been the first
to bundle out of the ball door, and the stage-
director, in order to make him look as much like a
woman as possible, had been swathed in silk from
top to toe and fastened up with safety-pins. He
had to be dragged out bodily by the kitchen-maids
to prevent him from suffocating in the cause of
decorum. Not one of the crowd of women present
had thought of throwing up the windows.

station.” Evidently the time is coming, or has
already come, when a steamer-load of lepers will
be regarded in the same matter-of-fact light as a
steamer-load pi frozen meat. "By-and-bye, special
freights and insurance rates will lie quoted for this
kind of cargo, and vessels will be lost through a
quantity of bulk lepers shifting during a gale and
putting the vessel on her beam-ends, or
through overloading, or spontaneous combus-
tion, or through want of sufficient allowance
for the possible swelling of the lepers cn
route. The Bulletin can see with a prophetic
eye the manifest of some tramp steamer on
the N.Q. coast ten years lienee; Ten tons
common or inferior lepers shipped as dead
weight; 40 crates of rare lepers with peculiar
symptoms, very valuable as medical curiosities;
quantity of refrigerated leper; one elephantiasis
patient in loose box on main deck; one insane
leper confined in hen-coop; stuffed leper in case
for museum ; petrified leper shipped as geological
specimen; one cask of pickled leper in brine ;
tombstone for prominent leper lately deceased ;
missionary; one box of hymn-books for leper-
station ; suspected leper in second cabin going up
for medical examination.

The leper-boy, Molloy, froin Rockhampton

logical examination of his blood. He now seems
to be recovering. His case was pronounced true
leprosy by eight doctors. Nor can the leprosy
bacillus be found in the blood of the Kanaka,
“Bob,” also getting better. What price the
leprosy-judgment of the average medico ? About

Extract front a speech by that wild Irish-
man, Chief-Justice Madden, of Vic. :
It was characteristic of the English people that, much
as they admired high courage, they were disposed to
insist that it should not he accompanied by anything
like dramatic effect. ... It was the cool, calm
determination to perform duty a id look for no further
reward which had made England's glorv wherever she
had been called upon to exhibit this quality. ... It
was this quality which won for England the battle of
Albuera, where a handful of Englishmen held “the hill
against a great mass of the,enemy, who supposed, from
the confident attitude of the men, that they were sup-
ported by strong reserves. The result was that the
French retreited, leaving the hill in the hands of IheEng-
lish. At Alma the day was won a dozen times by the
Russian army, hut the devoted bravery of small detached
bodies of English soldiers overthrew the opposing columns
which numbered at least 10,000.
Then, having done a final whoop about England,
Madden proceeded to distribute the Humane
Society’s medals to a large mtmher of people,
named Murphy and MacTavish and Muldoon and
O’Brien and Donald Mac Knight and Franz Oscar,
and things like that, who.had distinguished them-
selves by acts of valor.-

The Queensland planters, having robbed

agents, either white or Mack, are sent out from a
plantation, furnished with the fullest information
as to likely recruiting-grounds. They visit the
different plantations and talk with the boys whose
time has expired, or is about to expire. After
finding out the rate of wages they receive, the
agent, on behalf of his superior, offers a higher one.

A rise in N.S.W. horse-hair ! With Judge
Stephen in England, Judge Lines on six months’
leave. Judge Windeyer expecting a Privy Council
call ’Ome (which he won’t get—if the N.S.W.
taxpayer has to stand the racket) and Chief
Justice Darley engaged in gubernatorial functions,
there is a flutter in the hawkeries of Sydney.
In its criminal jurisdiction the court is very
short-handed. Chief Justice D irley, Acting-
Governor, cannot sit; Judge Windeyer, in view
of recent events, will not, or (in the opinion of
most people) should not sit; Judges Inims and
M. H. Stephen are ill; Judge Owen is in Equity,
and never wears scarlet and ermine; Judge
Manning (Bankruptcy) is, to the great regret
of all who have practised before him, in very bad
health, and seldom takes a hand in criminal
matters. So that, the whole of the work has been
threatening to fall on Mr. Justice Simpson. It
looks as if Premier-Barrister Reid would have
some nice morsels of legal patronage to dispense.
In Judge Lines’ absence, Mr. Henry E. Cohen,
erstwhile Minister of Justice, will have a seat on
the Supreme Court bench. Mr. Cohen is a man
of much ability as a commercial lawyer, but his
appointment came rather as a surprise to the public
—some of whom expected to see the senior Dis-
trict Court Judge (Murray) temporarily appointed.
The Ministry which inaugurates a system of ap-
pointing to the Supreme Court comparatively
young men of experience and vigor will deserve
public gratitude.

“ Canteen ” obtains at Trial Bay (N.S.W.)

Dear Bulletin, — Apropos
the recent Yio. shock of four
children at a birth. I lay odds
that the parents are each one of
twins. It is a cert, that twin
blood is on one side of the
parentage. I’ve had a deal of
experience in breeding stock,
principally sheep, which gener-
ally produce one at a time—
hence the human analogy.
Now, when twins were dropped,
I always had them put with
their mothers in a special pad-
dock, after carefully marking
them; and when matured I
mated them. A twin ram
mated with ordinary ewes very
frequently got twins, and a
twin ewe mated with an ordin-
ary ram also produced twins
very regularly. Going further,
1 mated a male twin with a
female twin, and in several
cases got triplets and quar-
tettes as the result. These in
turn, when mated, produced
wonderful results, but in every
case the progeny were still-
born. What I wish to point
out is, that twins should not
marry twins. The risk is too
great. Unfortunately, I myself
am one of triplets, and the gtrl
I adore is one of twins. I dare
not marry her.—Old Jackkeoo.

It is common in the North
to hale a blackboy or gin before
the magistrate, and induce the
aboriginal to put his or her
mark to a so-called agreement
binding the said nigger to serve
for several years. This passes
for a legal contract, but it is
really unadulterated slavery.
Another aboriginal grievance :
some lady down South fancies
she would like to have a black
picaninny to attend upon her,
and gives the order to an agent. The picaninny
can generally be procured, for there are several
picaninny-purveyors in the'North.

A lady lately died up North, leaving be-
hind her an indifferent husband and a broken-
hearted lover (who had worshipped her in her
pre-matrimonial days). Sympathy, strange to
say, went, not to the husband, but to the other
man ! It was the case of the cruelly-treated wife
and the old (and generally generous) adorer.
“Yes,” said a lady friend, “we ought to pity
Mr. Blank. I suppose wo’vo "ot to regard him
as the ‘ illegitimate widower 1 ’ ”

On the very Melbourne beat where the
big jewellery robbery took place, the other week,
a constable was reprimanded for being a minute
late in meeting his inspector at a given spot. A
constable told the writer that it is impossible to
convince some inspectors that being late may, in
some cases, be due to watching a suspicious
character, and that in consequence constables
prefer to let such matters slide rather than risk
being reported and perhaps fined for being behind
time. And yet the authorities are amazed that so
many burglaries occur. Burglars pick their time
to the minute, and are always safe from disturb-
ance so long as this system of meeting inspectors
at fixed spots at fixed times is in force.

With reference to a paragraph which ap-
peared in The Bulletin of 22ud June, stating
that a memorial brass-plate had been removed
from St. Mary’s Cathedral, and giving probable
reasons for the act, this paper is informed on the
best authority that the plate referred to was
merely taken down during the renovation of the
altar, and will be immediately replaced in a better
and more suitable position in the cathedral. As
there is not a shadow of truth in the insinuations
contained in the paragraph, The Bulletin very
much regrets its insertion.

“ Visiting a township after an absence of
20 years,” writes a commercial traveller to The
Bulletin, “I put up at the old coaching hotel,
and found the whilom groom and cook had joined
forces and were the proprietors. The railway had
deposed King Cobb, and the departure of the
drummers had shorn the house of its ancient
glories. On going upstairs I met the proprietress
opposite the bath-room, and had my attention
duly called to it, and to the advantages of the pre-
sent water-supply over the tank and water-cart of
the old time. ‘Ye know that (meaning the bath)
saves the girl dragging water upstairs and the
slops down, for she can empty them in the bath.
An’ it’s so handy when the water’s turned off ;
why, the other day it was cut off at five minutes’
notice, and we filled the bath and kept the house
going with it, as we sold the tanks to the selectors
when the waterworks were finished.’ Water from
that bath for culinary and drinking purposes !
Ugh !”

Because a London clergyman devotes bis
evangelising energies entirely to the lost sheep of
tiie flesh-colored-tights-and-high-kicking profes-
sion, a call has been made in cold print for
some Australian city pastors to do likewise. It
shouldn’t be difficult to answer that call. Any
merely tepid-blooded parson should be warm-
veined enough to volunteer to form Bible-classes
and prayer-soirees with (say) Sydney Lyceum
“ Gaiety ” girls. “ The intemperate kick of ouah
deah sistali Madge Rossell,” for instance, might
be made a frequent subject of special prayer.
Lessons in angelic leering, so as to spiritualise the
sensuous smile of sistah Grace Palotta, would be a
most encouraging branch of missionary work.
All this is zeal-firing enough, but there remains
beyond it a large and arid field for which,

as yet, there are no reapers. Who is
going to tackle the conversion of the ungodly
newspaper - man ? Of the pagan priest who
exalteth the horn of the Gaiety Girl, so to speak ?
Of the false prophet who maketh the common and
garden sinner to fall down and worship the Anti-
christ of plump proportions and rouged and
henna’d tints? Even General Booth, whose nose
oidy would almost pawnbroke Paradise without
any collateral security, is said to have despaired of
converting reporters. The writer has known one
or two converted reporters, but they couldn’t
report worth a cent, and their only recommenda-
tion was that they could always be found when
anything unpleasant had to be “represented ” by
“the paper.” There is, therefore, a loud call for
a New Evangelist who will devote his life, his
pastorhood (and his purse, if it’s worth it), to the
ungodly newsnaper-man.

Dear Bulletin, —To those abandoned
miscreants who, like myself, combine freecj|i)tn *
from any theological brand with an intimate
knowledge of the “pore heathen,” there is a
noble feast of farce in the figures with which
Romanists and Protestants are bolstering up their
respective “ crushings ” of proselytism. It
doesn’t matter an Amen to which sectarian shib-
boleth the dusky victim attaches himself—he
simply exchanges pagan plain for pagan with
trimmings. The more hypocritically adept lie
becomes in mouthing the formulie of a creed which
never gets deeper than his skin, the taller feather
he is in the convertitory cap of Father O’Flynn
or the Reverend Sandy Mae Snuffle. So that
honors are easy, anyhow ! Pagan Plain.

Is there a more aimless, graceless, sense-
less gambol on earth than the Scottish sword-
dance, or reel, or whatever may be the technical
name of that item which a gloomy Caledonian
perpetrates in kilts? The other night, at Melb.
Town Hall, a bare-legged young man placed two
swords crosswise upon the platform, and hopped
monotonously among the four quarterings, whilst
a brither Scot blew beastly noises from the bag-
pipes. The young man was described on the
programme as dancing “Gillie Callum.” Osten-
sibly, he was impersonating a poodle on hot bricks.
Anxiety was written on his face, his body ap-
peared bent with colic, his legs formed two sides
of an equilateral triangle, and worked from the
knees without regard to the squealing of his in-
fernal orchestra. “Gillie Galium” lasted nine
minutes by the clock, and, when it ceased, a voice
from the audience cried, “ Verra guid reel 1 ”

Mr. Rayner, described as “ a representa-

some remarks about another man’s wife in a
pamphlet issued by him. It is necessary here to
state that Mr. Rayner (who formerly travelled in
Queensland for a brief period as a Bulletin can-

Bulletin to say, in that country or elsewhere,
a "vthing about anybody’s wife.
The middle week in July will be sadly re-
membered by Australian miners. On the 18th,
nine men, working in the slopes at the back of the
400 ft. level of the Broken Hill South, were killed
by a concussion of air, caused by a creep in the
workings. On the 20th, six men employed at the
M'Evoy gold and tin mine, Eldorado (Vic.), were
entombed by a similar creep, coming this time
from old workings. Several others, working near
by, would have been killed by the rush of liquid
mullock had not Joseph Ferguson, one of the
heroes so often discovered in mining emergencies,
rushed up the crosscut to them, away from the
shaft and safety, and called them out. They were
just able to get clear, and would have been.over-
taken and smothered had not a huge boulder stuck
in the drive behind them. As it was, they were
wading through mullock up to their necks. And
on the 21st inst., the Broken Hill Block limine
was discovered to be on fire, and remains so at
time of writing.
The Melbourne Government House balls
which have been announced have proved an
incentive to the artistes de toilettes. Much toil

rare artistic skill in this way was a faultlessly-
fitting evening gown of lovely rich brocaded silk,
draped in thoroughly Parisian taste, in Messrs.

and who has evidently received a good share of
the gift which made Worth famous in the world

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
THE ADMIRAL!
(A long shot for the ’95 Cup.)
It was the time when punters ask—
“ What horse think you the Cup will win?"
And men essay the simple task
Of doing surplus dollars in.
Each horse’s breeding, age, and “weight"
I scanned ; then sought a pal of yore,
Whose tips were tolerably straight—
He’d put me on “ good things ” before.
I found Gamaliel in the bines,
Recovering from rum, alack 1
I named the horses, bade him choose
The likeliest, and best to back.
Bnthe, the Oracle, seemed glum—
Sat sad and silent, in his chair,
Till half a tumblerful of rum
Produced a somewhat brisker air.
Then spake: “ Hard times and biz. forlorn
Have changed these days from days of yor- ,
And Melbourne now, alas ! is shorn
Of old Cup-glories, evermore.
‘We’re stiff as biscuits here in town:
All tiie good chaps are ‘ up a tree ’ —
And more, tiie Cup - with stakes cut down—
Is not the race it used to be !”
He drained ids glass and heaved a sigh,
And o’er tiie list of horses looked ;
Then, slyly; winked his dexter eye
And said, “ I guess ‘ The Cup ’ is cooked!"
Another drink lie drained. Tiie same,
In lesser quantity, I took ;
Whilst inspiration somehow came
From emphasis he laid on “cook.”
“ The horse that’s owned by Sammy Cook ?”
“Guessed well and wisely !” said my pal;
“Get hence, and with some honest ‘book’
Put your ‘ bit ’ on—Tiie Admiral.”
The Admiral’s tiie horse I’m “shook”
Upon ; and for tiie Cup I shall
Place confidence In “Captain Cook”
And dollars on his—Admiral.

A motion in favor of abolishing the “ tote ” has
be -n carried in Maoriland Parliament. The pr ‘Vince has
had lime to forget tiie old pre-tote days when it was
over-run with bookmakers, vvelshers and spielers, and tiie
raw, red-headed Presbyterian element once more asserts
itself, with the Mossy Isaacs brigade shooing it on. How-
ever, Govt, proposes to let the tote alone.

“Tom” Manifold, killed in* the hunting-field

Western district, polo champion, he died in agony at tiie
early age of 30 years. The second amateur killed in the
Vic. hunting-field within a fortnight.

An open secret is the expressed and exe-
cuted determination of the owner of a disqualified
Caulfield Cup winner never to allow his prads to finish
behind those of tiie man to whom the Cup was awarded.
The revenge has been carried out. Tiie “ other man ”
has run into second place many times, always to find the
winner supplied by bis enemy.

Victorian criticism of the totalisator chiefly
radiates from Bendigo, the city of Alf. Joseph. Aif. and
his appointed legal wire-puller are making themselves
busy everywhere, hut it is from the Bendigo pubs., press,
and pulpit that the voice of Josephus will be oftenest
heard.
There are many points to be noted in connec-
tion with anli-Tote manifestations. Melb Sportsman is
doing its poor little best to uphold the Hebrews, who
support it largely ; and Melb. Herald puls the best
possible face —which is an ugly one at that—on Ikey Mo,
because tiie Sportsman aforesaid represents the ’Erald
stable. The Tote struggle is full of humor for the
initiated.

A row looms re the captaincy of next Austra-
lian eleven. The position is by most people assigned to
Geo. Giffen, hut there are many who predict rhat should
he bead the team the results will he dire. Writes one
correspondent; “Everybody knows what an important
factor a good captain is, and everybody who knows any-
thing about Australian cricket knows that Australia
would have won tiie rubber from Stoddart’s team had
Giffen not been our captain. A man so irritable, full of
prejudice, and with suoh’an exalted opinion of his own
prowess, should never be allowed to have charge of an
Australian Eleven. There is one man who is certain to be
in the team who lias all the essentials of a captain— good
temper, excellent judgment of game and men, fairness
and coolness. His claims cannot lie overlooked. Victoria’s
success was due to him last season ; that man is Harry
Troit.” Then (here is a contingent who advocate the
claims of Blackball! as captain, while admitting that as
regards active cricket he has long passed the meridian.
George Giffen says he has not been consulted as
to the personnel of the next Australian team, and know*
nothing about the prospective team under the manage-
ment of Phil. Sheridan. Giffen’s candidate for manager
is “Jack" Creswell, sec. S.A.C.A.
* ♦ * *
English cricket statistics to date explain, in a
measure, the high scores made by Australia against
Stoddart’s team. Richardson, Briggs, Peel, and Look-
wood stood only seventh, tenth, and eighteenth, respec-
tively, on the list of bowling averages, the cracks thus far
being Painter, Rougher, Attewell, and Murch. Peel’s
fahing-off is remarkable.

M‘Laren’s innings of 424 against Somersetshire
must surprise everybody who saw that somewhat wan
young man make his two big scores on the Melb. ground.
Although a fine, free, safe bat for awhile after he had
“got set’’—not an everyday occurrence with him —
M’Laren seemed physically incapable of preserving Ins
form through a whole day's play. He made 200 odd
against Victoria, but at the 150 stage he weakened to such
a degree that any good ball wou.d have beaten him, and
for about balf-an-bour bis wicket wasn’t worth five
minutes purchase. In tlie final test-match, M’Laren was
exhausted when he hit bis wicket, so completely done-up
as to suggest the idea that he purposely put himself out
of bis misery.
* * • *
W. G. Grace, says The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, lias reason for pray for ttie soul of the man
who first invented cricket, for tie owes all that lie lias in
the world to it. His two achievements of completing his
liundredtli hundred, and making his 1000 runs in the
first month ot the season, created quite a furore, which has
not quite died out, and a national testimonial is in pro-
gress, led by the Daily Telegraph, the astute managers
of which, seeing a big advt. in it, have started a shilling
subscription. But as people talk of collecting from
£30,000 to £50,000 I lie shillings w ill need to come in faster
and thicker th in they have up to now. A letter from
“ Tummy ” to Grace gave the thing a big fillip, and Col.
North followed this up with a cheque for £5O. The
M.C.C. are to give £lOO, Surrey the same amount, and a
like sum is promised by his own county.
A proposal lias been made to insure Grace’s life
for the benefit of his family to the amount of £20,000,
but I don’t think this will suit VV.G.’s book, as he is fond
of cash, and would much rather have half the amount on
the nail. But whatever is done people must hurry up,
for though the glamour of successive big scores will keep
up enthusiasm, a few small ones will soon damp it, and
already there are signs of W.G. getting out of form. He
fluked up 30, Hie other day, at Lord’s, but ought to have
been caught before he bad scored. In fact, all this season
his luck has been remarkable.

H. H. Massie, having been made an hon,
member of Marylebone C.C., was playing for the club
against Kent at Lord’s when the mail left. He had only made
four when his stumps W'ere scattered ; and he distin-
guished himself in I lie field by missing an easy catch or
two. He received quite an ovation from the crowd and
pavilion, for the recollection of his prowess at the Oval in
’B2 is still fresh. Massie’s manner, too, is liked.

The interest in Sydney football this season
culminated last Saturday in tiie match Randwick v.
Pirates, which 10,000 people gathered to witness. When
the match began the Pirate forwards, though lighter than
the Randwicks, swept down the gr mud W'ith a tierce pace
which threatened the hostile line every second. But it
was behind the forwards that the battle was lost and won.
The feverish excitement spread throughout the Pirat#
team, making their backs eager and anxious, while tba
Rand wick backs preserved a sure and cool defence. Then,
too, there was admirable generalship on the Bandwlck
side. Early in the game the easiest chance possible was
given one of'the Pirate backs, but the demoralising
excitement of his side caused him (a very fine kick) to
miss a goal that many a novice would have scored. There
is one point, however, on which too much praise cannot
be given the Pirates. When the game stood Randwick 6,
Pirate 0, and Duggan, of Randwick, got hurt too badly to
play on, the Pirates allowed a fresh man to take his place.
One man less might have made tiie contest equal ; as it
was Randwick won by 14 points to 0.

The football-match on Sydney Cricket Ground
last Saturday, University v. Paddington Electorate,
ended in a hollow win for University by 19 points to'o.
The mile and two-miles cycling handicaps were both won
by Graeme. The scratch men were never in it, and the
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen will have to abandon the
practice of handicapping men out of a race unless they
wish to absolutely kill tire interest. And public interest
in the cash amateur must be kept up to boiling-point
always.

Geelong, cocksure of dishing Essendon, was
knocked silly by the latter’s dashing play, and only
recovered in time to find the match lost. At no point of

tire opinion of some good judges, played the best game in
its history.

There is a club in Chelsea where neophytes are put

the historical “bow window’’) has a branch establish-
ment there where ladies can breakfast or take refreshers,
and this lias quite given a cachet to the business. It may
interest ladies to know'that “rational” costume is not
worn, all the fair riders being attired in short dresses of
blue serge.

The battle between the bat and ball seems now
all in favor of the bat. Grace’s record of 344 rung lias

almost paid for themselves. The Bulletin

more than satisfied with the Hattersley machines,
and have sent for more.

Joe Thompson named his residence at
Bast Melbourne *‘Don Juan House,” after the
winner of the Melbourne Cup of 1873. Had he
known a few days before the race the condition of
the Don he would have probably never had a
house. A violent attack on the lungs was only
abated and the horse brought round by the unre-
mitting care of a most popular Victorian trainer,
whose good judgment has since been rewarded by
the success of winning the greatest Australian
handicap with a horse of his own breeding.*
Judges want to know if Carbine, who is

Memoir are similarly bred the winners in the
sweep might cable “ Portland.”*

Ihe new extradition treaty with Argentina,
under which Balfour was surrendered, is now
known in .England as the Jabez Corpus Act.
Dear Bulletin, —A suggestion. Why
should there not be a federal Acclimatisation
Board to supervise ami regulate the introduction
ot non-Australasian animals and plants likely to
thrive and be a source of profit to Australasia, to
prevent the introduction of possible pests, and to
em ct the acclimatisation of desirable animals and
plants of one province in another, where possible?
What may happen through unregulated private
enterprise is manifest in the rabbit and fox plagues
throughout the Australias, and in the destructive
effect efforts to reduce these plagues have had
on other useful beasts and birds. What can be
gone by persistent and wise endeavor has already
been shown in several provinces. In Victoria,
we now have fallow' deer on the Upper Yarra, the
Indian axis deer on the Grampians, Sambur deer
in ttie Koo-w'ee-rup swamp district, Rusa and
x ormosan ut-er in the Gembrook ranges, and hares
in (southern Victoria. We have ostriches in
Western Victoria, pheasants in theDandenong dis-
trict, while thrushes, starlings, minahs, and spar-
rows keep down insect-pests all over the country.
On the other hand, the alpaca, which requires
mountainous country IO.OOUft. above sea-level, has
failed for lack thereof, and the cashmere goat from
a similar cause ; also, partridges, Californian
quail, robins, goldfinches, linnets, and other small
birds have practically succumbed to native cats,
tiger cats, iguanas, snakes, laughing jackasses,
hawks, and bush-fires. Trout thrive well, but
English and Californian salmon have failed
utterly. In Maoriland, again, red, axis and fallow
deer, the Ceylon elk, hares, and Tasmanian black
opossums have been successfully acclimatised ; so
have pheasants, partridges, quail, skylarks, black-
birds, thrushes, finches, starlings, minahs, linnets,
a,nd sparrows among birds; and trout, char, white-
fish, perch, tench, and salmon among fish. In
Westralia, also, trout from Tasmania, Murray cod
and Murray perch from South Australia, and
silver eels from Victoria have been successfully
introduced. Lots more can be done in this way
in all the provinces, and a federal acclimatisation
board could do it best of all.— J.S.R.
ILNO S “ERUIT SALT.”—A lady writes:—
( 1 think you will be glad to hear that I find your
x RU IT SALT ’ a most valuable remedy ; and I
can assure you I recommend it to all my friends,
and the result is always satisfactory. Everything,
medicine or food, ceasi d to act properly for at
least months befoie I commenced taking it;
the little food I could take generally .punished me
or returned. My life was one of great suffering,
so that I must have succumbed before long. To
me and our family it has been a great earthly bles-
sing. I feel I cannot ray too much for it.” Sold

Buyers and manufacturers interested in
baking and confectionery trades are reminded that
the third annual International Exhibition and
Market, confined exclusively to these important
industries, will be held in London, England, from
September 21 to 28 of this year. All the engineer-
ing and manufacturings firms of repute in England
are making prominent exhibits, and there is]
reason to believe that all the inventions that have
been introduced in recent years will be-.on view.
The Agricultural Hall is the largest building of
its kind in England, and the whole of the Great
Hall is already fully let, and there remains but
little space in the galleries. The attendance last
year was nearly 200,000 people in the week, and
very large commercial transactions were effected
by the exhibitors. The Exhibition has the sup-
port and countenance all the associations con-
nected with the trade in the United Kingdom.*
Mr. W. R. Wilson paid a flying visit to
Sydney, last week, to confer with Mr. George
Adams as to fixing the date of drawing the St.
Alban’s sweep. Tickets are being sold at the
rate of 10,000 a month, and Mr. Adams thinks
this number might be increased threefold if the
date of drawing were announced, but it has been
decided not to do this at present. Mr. Wilson
fears that the requisite number of shares might
not—in spite of Mr. Adams’ opinion to the con-
trary —be taken up on the appointed day.
This would involve his taking a parcel him-
self, and possibly becoming a prize-winner—
which he does n>t want to be. Mr. Adams
says the best periods of the year for selling shares
in these large sweeps are the spring months,
during the sporting season, and at the close of the
shearing.*

a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal ‘ Alfaline Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
nlthomrh this is over five years ago I have "remained well ever since. Ihe Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.—

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir, - I think it my duty to
inform you tbit a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system
and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alf aline Pills completely cured i/'e of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness, I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, T consider you are deserving of success, wmcn
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen, March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous" System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading:doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper ot
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE lIA GERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which d d
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that

you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

“ It la consoling,” writes a Melb, cones-
pendent to Ihb Bulletin, “ for a Melbourne man
who sits at breakfast picking splinters of Ballarat
bacon from between bis teeth, to read in his morn-
| ll g journal that Victoria is likely to establish an
immense bacon-export trade. The local consumer
I Ilever struggles with a bit of badly-cured pig with-
j out wishing it had been exported. Seeing that
i Batls factory ham can be bought from the same
people who grow the tough] ill-flavored rasher of
salt wood, there is surely some giound for the
assertion that first-class Australian bacon is an
impossibility.” Yet they sell in Sydney excellent
V ictonan bacon.

Editor Bulletin, —Re Federation. The
settlers on this river (Dumaresq, Q.) don’t want
Tit. I his year they have sold their tobacco for
7 §d. per lb. all round. In Sydney it is often sold
as low as l^d. —hardly ever higher than sd.
Jfederation would, as far as I can see, destroy this
industry the only one left whereby a few pounds
can be made at farming. But just admire the
madness of the said settlers. Everyone is this
season doing his utmost to place Chinamen on
his land to grow the weed, so that he himself may
sit down and look on. He will take, say, one-
third of the crop; and to be as well off as if he
grew two acres himself, ho must get the Chinese
to grow six acres. One hundred farmers growing
600 a. tobacco by Chinese will flood the local
market and reduce prices to N.S.W. level, whilst
100 J farmers growing only 200 a. would be safe
and have all the profits, and not overstock the
market. There is no outlet for leaf, as every
province and country levies heavy import duties.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Kailway Employ© at Kaiapoi,
New Zealand, writes;
“About ten years ago, while engaged in
shunting, my foot caught between the rails,
and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About
a year ago it became much worse, and I
feared I should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. I did so, and after taking four
bottles the swelling disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with it since.”

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
" It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ i enger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick tip flesh and
strength."
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used."
When the M.L. Tariff Commission visited
Brunnerton (West Coast) lately, the local Mayor,
who chaperoned it, pointing to the cliff across
the bridge, called attention to a mass of fallen
rocks and debris and the remains of a house which
have been turned upside-down, and delivered him-
self thus: “ There were 40 people in that house one
night last week holding a wake, when the slip
occurred and knocked them all topsy-turvy, yet
the only one who was not injured was the corpse.
The room he was in was not smashed like the
other rooms, but the mercy is, with all them
boulders coming through, some of them were not
killed, though they were nearly all smashed a bit
and bruised.”
There has been much mysterious shaking
of heads lately amongst fat persons—who know
all about Boaz and Tubal-Cain, and who each
month walk around the grave of Hiram Abiff with
their fingers to their noses—over a recent N.S.W.
country-town incident. A newly-arrived civil
servant, who doesn’t belong to the craft, had put
up at the leading hotel, the headquarters of the
local Masonic lodge. The barnacle’s bedroom
was next to the lodge-room, and for many years
had been used on lodge-nights by the mystic
brotherhood as a sort of ante-room to the lodge—
a department where preliminary mysteries were
conducted, where quaking novices were put
through their paces, where, maybe, the Gulielmus
Capricornicus of the lodge found temporary stable
accommodation, and where—this at any rate is a
certainty—the members were in the habit of
depositing their hats and overcoats. On lodge-
night the civil servant, after a nightcap at the
bar, proceeded to his bedroom, near the door
of which, to his great mystification, he found a
functionary standing, sword in hand. The C.S.
pushed past this potentate—the tyler of the lodge
—and proceeded to open his bedroom door. The
tyler, in terrible accents, said : “ You cannot enter
there !” and made a menacing movement. Where-
upon the C.S., an athletic personage, closed with
the guard, and, having thrown him downstairs,
entered his room, to find it filled with 50 or 60
different varieties of hats, &o. These he promptly
pitched out of the window, together with some of
the lodge-paraphernalia, and so completely vindi-
cated his position as sole tenant of the room that
if the lodge billy-goat wasn’t found in the public
pound next day it wasn’t his fault. The Masons
are horrified at the outrage, and a complaint
having been made to the head of the civil servant’s
department, he has been called upon for a report.

A first-class smoking-carriage on the Hob-
son’s Bay line (Vic.) was occupied the other even-
ing by one gaudy dude, in a fur-lined coat and a
top-hat. Just as the train was starting, a work-
man scrambled in. The top-hatted one glared at
him with the disgusted expression of a man who
wasn’t accustomed to such beastly low company,
and ostentatiously lighted a sixpenny cigar to
purify the atmosphere. The workman stared
back, and retaliated with a short pipe. Then the
superior person moved to the further end of the
carriage, and crowded himself into the corner till
they got to Windsor, when he waved his cane out
of the window and called a “ portah.” “This—
haw—person haft intruded himself here—l believe,
without any authority whatevah. Would you—
haw—inspect his ticket?” The workman pro-
duced a first-class ticket, and said, curtly ;
“Pr’aps you’ll be so kind as to inspect his
ticket now ? ” Then there was a long delay while
the lofty person felt among his high-priced clothes,
and at last reluctantly handed out a second-class
season. “You’ll have to get out of here, sir,”
said the official, in an unsympathetic voice.
“Shall I help you to chuck him out?” said the
workman. Then a door banged loudly, and a cold
gust of wind blew the top-hat along the platform.

Sant by some satirical dog:— Bulletin
man (noticing highly-decomposed human head on
St. Kilda beach); “Ah ! Here’s a story for the
Christmas number 1”
The first Sydney Sunday newspaper was
the Sydney Gazrttb of 2nd April, 1803. The
change from Saturday to Sunday was made so
that a whole week’s news and shipping should
appear. It remained a Sunday paper for seven
years.
In Australasia hanging is the commonest
method of suicide among men, shooting comes
second, cutting, stabbing and drowning tie
for third place, while poisoning stands fourth.
Women go mostly for drowning and poisoning,
often for stabbing or hanging, hardly ever for
shooting.

ing upon the fly-leaf of the family-Bible the name

“Rich the treasure, sweet the pleasure■ sweetest pleasure after pain.
Dryden (Homocea Measure.)
“ IT TOUCHES THE SPOT.”—Aye, that is what ‘Homocea 1
does. And does it quickly too—whether it’s a toothache or
neuralgia, with all their shooting pains, eczema, with its
painful and distressing irritation. Rheumatism in the joints or
muscles has been cured, even of years’ standing—while for
cuts, burns, and bruises it is far ahead of any ointment that has ever been
before the public.
LORD GARRICK
says ‘Homocea*
cured him of He-
ƒ
morrhoids, when
all else failed ; that he gave some to a labourer who was rendered quite lame
f
by a stone falling upon him, and it cured him in tour
days. A woman had a pain in the elbow and could
not bend it for a year, and it cured her, and another
used it for a bad leg, and it was doing her good.
One letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff 1 ever came across.”
LORD COMBERMERE says that he
found “ Homocea did him more good
than any other embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.
f
Remember that “ Homocea” subdues inflammation and allays irritation almost as soon as applied.
All Storekeepers and Chemists stock “Homocea.”

The Obstinacy of Mrs. Tatton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were lying off the town of Niafu, in
Vavau, one of the Friendlies, when Tatton came
on board. He was a short, dark, thick-set
man, and master of a small trading vessel, the
Lunahlo. We had made his acquaintance at
Wallis Island about a year previously, and on the
sain© day that we ran into Yavau the Lunalilo
followed us, towed in by her boat. As she passed
our vessel, Tatton, whom we saw standing aft,
waved his hand and called out to me to come on
board after supper, and the skipper and myself
were about getting ready when the steward came
to say
“ Here’s Captain Tatton, sir.”
We jumped up and shook hands with him. Our
skipper, a rough, hard-shell, old Connecticut
Yankee, with a heavy hand and a soft heart, at
once blurted out —
“ What the blazes is the matter with you,
Tatton ? Got yaller fever or the cholery morbus
aboard ? Anyone been and run away with your
little missus, or what ?”
Tatton attempted to smile at old Barron’s joke,
but failed. .
“No one has run away with Luisa, Barron,
but she’s leaving me, all the same. The poor girl’s
dying. I came in here thinking I would find the
Narrangansett. She passed me last night, heading
this way, and steaming very fast. I burnt every
blue-light I had on the schooner, and fired a gun ;
but she was too far off, I suppose,” and the
sturdy, hard - faced seaman passed his hand
Wearily over his face.
In an instant Barron, the grizzled old veteran
of 30 years’ hardship and adventure in the two
Pacifies, reached out his hand to Tatton.
“ That’s bad news. Is there anything we can
do for you, Tatton? I guess you reckoned on the
Narrangansett’s doctor. Is she very bad ?”
Tatton nodded. “ Dying. I can see that; and
I think she knows it, too. Only a doctor can be
of any use. What can I do? I wonder if the
Yankee has gone on to Tongatabu ? If I thought
so I would heave up and try and get there in
time.” ~ , . ,< ,
“ Wait till to-morrow,” said our skipper, she
thay turn up by then. And they told us in Apia
that they were coming here first.”
This cheered Tatton up a bit; and, after a glass
of grog, he asked me to go back with him. Before
leaving the cabin our skipper said to me
1 “ Got any champagne left in the trade-room ? ’
“ About half-a-case.’’
“ All right, put it down against me”—and when
the steward handed down a heavy native basket
into Tatton’s boat I knew what it was, and whom
it was for. And I remembered that when Tatton,
Barron, and myself were involved in an angry
argument over a.yam-trading incident at Futuna,
our visitor had told the grizzled old skipper “ he
was too blasted mean to live, like all Yanks.
# * *
.Tatton’s schooner, like our own vessel,
lay close in to the shore, and the distance between
them was short. He was very silent, and I could
she he was deeply touched at the prospect of losing
his wife. About a year or so before we had met
him at Wallis Island, he had married the daughter
o£_an old trader living on one of the Navigators
Group—a delicate-looking, child-like creature,
who, were she in civilisation, would hardly have
left the nursery. And since then Tatton, the
hard-drinking, quarrelsome skipper whose chief
argument in any dispute was his fist —and he had
many arguments, in which native women were
generally involved—had undergone a wonderful
change and acquired an extraordinary renown ;
in brief, he became that rare fiah in any sea, a
moral trading captain.
• # •
Luisa, born of a Manhikian mother by a
white father, was lying on a bed of soft mats
spread on the cabin floor. By her side was a
native sailor fanning her, for the cabin was close.
Seated on the transoms a few feet further off was
another seaman, a big, sallow-faced native of
Mauhiki. He was nursing a baby—a baby with
a face like a toad. He looked stolidly at us for a
moment, then bent his face over that of the sleep-
ing child.
“ She is asleep,” said the man beside her in a
whisper. Tatton silently motioned me to a seat,
and we spoke in whispers.
“ Born just as we passed Beveridge Reef a week
ago,” and he pointed over to where the big Man-
hiki man sat solemnly swaying to and fro.
“ She wanted to be away from Aitutaki
pined co get back to Samoa to her mother and
her people. So I closed up the station and
brought her aboard. Such rotten luck you never
saw. Head winds and calms, calms and head
winds, for nearly a month ; and then, just off
Beveridge . . .”
Here the girl moved and awoke.
“ Luisa,” said Tatton, bending over her, “here
is'an old friend of your father’s.”
The girl looked at me; then put out her slender
hand and said in her mother’s tongue, in a voice
scarce above a whisper, “ Ah, yes, I remember
you. Have you forgotten the day when you and
my father and brothers went to Apia to the
fa’atau fui (auction) and Alafoti, the big American
who rapped on the table with a hammer, gave me
a dressed-up doll? ’’—and she smiled faintly.
m * *
That was over six years ago. How it all
came back to me ! Fat, jolly old Alvora, sell-
ing a miscellaneous lot of goods in an Apian resi-
dent’s house, and the strange, motley crowd that
surrounded him ; among them this girl s father,
his sons and myself. And I remembered, too, a
little girl of about ten coming in at the door,
dressed in European style, and smiling at us ; and
old Ned bringing her over to me and telling me it
was his little girl “ runned down from the Sisters
where she was a-sohoolin’ to see her brothers;
then when the faatau tai was over how the old
dried-up trader, his stalwart sons, the little girl
and myself all walked up to the French Mission
and gave the runaway back to the good Sisters.
And here she w is now, not yet much past sixteen,
a mother, and dying.
The big sailor cirae over beside her and squatted
cross-legged on the mats, latton placed his arm
around her and raised her up to look at the
hideous little bundle of mortality in his arms.
“ What an ugly little aitu (devil) it is,” she said
to Tatton in Samoan, as the Manhiki man placed
it on the mat within touch.
Tatton turned to me with something like a
smile. “By God, she’s pulling herself together
again. If that cruiser would only show up Id
give the ship and cargo.” Then he went and
opened the wine and gave her a glass.
I stayed another hour or so, and then left them;
bearing in my mind the picture of the slight
figure of the girl, who had again fallen asleep
under the effects of the wine, lying motionless on
the couch of mats; the big man-nurse, and
Puniola, the Savage Island sailor, softly waving
his fan over the wan features; and Tatton, with
his sun-browned face, resting on his hand, gazing
intently down upon the sleeper.
• • •
The grey mists of dawn had scarcely
begun to shift from the hills behind Niafu
when we saw the long black hull °f the
Narrangansett steaming up the harbor, bne
was one of the famed “ ninety - day ships,
and made a brave show as she cut aside the calm
waters and brought up a couple of hundred yards
astern of us. Her anchor had barely touched the
ground when we saw Tatton s boat pull alongside,
and in another five minutes leave again with
another man seated beside Tatton, and pull hard
for the Lunalilo. ~ , „ . , ,
“ Waal, now, look at that,” said the Grizzled
One to me, as we sat sipping our coffee on the
skylight; “there’s a man that, for the past ten
years, has been up to all kind of red-hot oussed-
ness, plain and decorated, nigger-catchin , women-
buyin’, and sioh like Island fixin’s, and, as sure as
I ain’t one of the saved, but he’s jest a turned
man, all over that slip of a yaller girl. Laud
alive ! but he must think a lot of her, to have the
front to pull the doctor outer his bunk before
coffee in the morning ! ”
» • •
We had finished our coffee and were
watching the movements of those on board the
steamer when we saw the Lunalilo s boat again
leave and pull over to us, with only two men
in her. They bumped up alongside, and one
jumped on deck and gave me a note from iatton,
“ Come on board as quick as you can. Bring
Allan with you.” .
Allan was our boatswain, a M inhiki half-caste.
Wondering what was wrong, I called him, and we
got in the boat and went aboard. The moment
we gained the deck Tatton met us, looking pale
and excited. The doctor of the man-of-war was
sitting on deck smoking a cigar.
“ How is she ?” I asked Tatton.
“ Bad, rny lad ; and the doctor says that unless
he can attend to her at once she cannot possibly
live more than a few days.”
“Well,” I asked wonderingly, “why doesn t
he?” „ ......
“ Because she won’t let him. Says she d rather
die ten times over first. You know what a curious
sort of modesty native women have about some
things. Well, as soon as ever the doctor came on
board—of course I’d let him know as far as my
knowledge went what was wrong—l told her he
would soon put her right. She sat up and com-
menced to cry, and said she wouldn’t have him; and
the moment I went on deck to call the doctor down
that big Manhiki buck lifted her up and carried
her into my cabin, put the youngster in with her,
and then locked the door. Now, he’s standing
guard outside. The fool says he’ll kill anyone
that tries to open it. You see he’s a kind of a
far-away cousin of the family on the mother s side.
That’s why I asked you to bring Allan. Perhaps
he can talk Rimi over into ...”
Allan shook his head. “ It’s no use, Captain
Tatton,” he said in excellent English. “If you
like I’ll go down and scruff Rimi and sling him on
deck ; but, by God, I’ll take his place if your wife
wants me to keep out the doctor.”
“Curse you for a wooden-headed Kanaka,
said Tatton ; “ don’t I tell you she’s got to die if
she won’t see the doctor ?”
“Look here, Captain Tatton,’ said the half-oaste
boatswain again, “ you ought to know enough of
native ways by this time to know that no man can
aid your wife. Take her ashore here to some of
the old Tongan women. She’d be disgraced for
life if you force a doctor on her, and she knows
ifc ’’ .
Poor Tatton was half mad. We went to
the man-of-war doctor and explained. He was a
good-natured man, and listened quietly.
“ I will wait here another hour—two hours, he
said, “if you think she will change her mind. If
she won’t I think you can’t do better than take
this man’s advice,” pointing to Allan, “ and let
her be attended by some native women. They
may save her life, but I doubt it. It’s a surgical
case.”
Then he got up and walked to the rail.
* • •
Allan went down, and his huge country-
man and he talked. Then Allan called out to us to
come down, except the doctor, and the big man
opened the door and let us in. Luisa was lying
in Tatton’s bunk, clasping his hideous little effigy
to her bosom. ...
“Luisa,” said Tatton, placing his hand on her
arm, and speaking in English, “do you under-
stand that if you will not let the American fo mat
attend to you that you will die ? Is it not so ? ’
turning to Allan and me.
The girl’s big, frightened eyes sought ours to
read the answer, and then slowly closed. She lay
quite still a moment or so while the tears welled
out and coursed down her cheeks.
“ E pule le Atua ,” she said at last. (“ It is God s
will if I die.”)
“Luisa,” I said, “don’t you want to see your
brothers and sisters again? Why are you ashamed?
In papalagi (the white man’s land), when a child
is born or a woman is sick to death, it is the cus-
tom of all women to have with them a fo'mai to
save them from death.”
She shook her head. “ I know. Tatton hath
told me that many times. But what woman but a
shameless white woman would suffer such a thing?”
• * *
The doctor’s step sounded overhead. Ritni,
with a dangerous look in his eye, shoved past us
and stood at the head of the bunk. Allan, speak-
ing in Manhikian to him, said, “Have no fear,’
and he went out again. Poor devil, a perfect
slave to Tatton at any other time, he was ready to
lay his life down in defence of this ever-so-distanl
cousin before she should be “ made ashamed.”
Then we went on deck again, defeated. The
doctor said he would send some medicine—all he
could do. As he stood in the gangway lighting
another cigar he said, in answer to Tatton : “ Oh,
yes ; give her a glass of champagne now and then ;
it’ll keep her alive a little longer and do no harm.”
I went away with the doctor, leaving Allan to
help Tatton take his wife ashore to the native she-
doctors of Niafu village.
* • • 1
Four days afterwards Luisa died. After
the burial Tatton went off to the Narrangansett,
and the doctor improvised a cunningly-contrived
feeding-bottle with a thick rubber tube for the
little Tatton, and gave a couple of dozen tins of
milk “to tucker the kid,” as Tatton expressed it,
“ till he could leave it with its mother’s folks.”

mates piped hands to supper on the war-ship, the
Lunalilo hove up, and with Tatton at the wheel
paid off before the first puffs of the land-breeze.
Seated between the up-ended flaps of the skylight
was the big, sallow-faced native sailor, with Luisa’s
toad-faced legacy in his lap.
LOUIS BECKE.
“,I will endeavor,” was the only answer
that a Castlemaiue (Vic.) parson could get from
an intending husband in answer to the usual
“love, cherish, and protect” marriage-service
question. The lady was more certain of herself.

Dear Bulletin, —From my brother, out
back: “ The Bulletins reach me in sad repair.
First, the postmaster opens them just to see they
are all right. Then the policeman takes them
home for security, like. The chap with the station-
bag looks upon all papers as his property for the
time being ; the boss and overseer take a squint on
the sly. Paddy cadges them from someone and
reads them to the whole hut, every word, from
articles to book-dept. The boundary-rider brings
them out here, and has them off by heart. When
the last lot came Dan and I patched them up
and struggled through them, and two swaggies
got them and took them down the track to Heaven
knows where. Those Bulletins are well read.”
At the recent opening of the new Rich-
mond-South Yarra Bridge, a spread was given by
the local mayors, and at the conclusion, a caterer’s
assistant, finding one of the guests with a bottle
of wine in his possession, had him locked up on a
charge of theft—which was dismissed at Court,
there being no proof of felonious intent. But
things turned out otherwise some months back,
at a big Northern wedding between the son of a
local magnate and a district heiress. The eere :
mony was a marvellous and magnificent affair,
and the local boomsters and bung-bank directors
tumbled over each other thereat. Suddenly a
would-be funny youth, seeing a very heavy swell
leavipg a side-gate with a small parcel under his
arm, called out: “I see yer! He’s sneaking
some of the presents.” It turned out the
true word spoken in jest, and the bold
peculator, becoming confused, admitted his
guilt in the drawing-room before the assembled
guests. The young couple were “ off ” a prosecu-
tion, but the biggest boomster present stepped
forward and said that the rights of property must
be respected, and a duty was owed to society,
thereupon sending for a policemen. At the trial
of the larcenist the fact was carefully omitted
that he was a guest at the wedding, all the evi-
dence of the prosecution making it appear as if he
had sneaked in by the back-gate ; but the prisoner
knocked all this in a heap by getting into the box
to testify on his own behalf, and swearing that he
had smiled upon the bride’s family when they
wre but at the outer portals of Sassiety. Then
toe bride took hysterica on the floor of the court,
and her mother burst into a series of heart-rending
sobs, and all was chaos for a few seconds until the
presiding beak summed up sufficient presence of
mind to yell out “six months.”
Self-Sacrifice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The thing,” said Philos, “is too one-sided to
bear discussion. It is always viewed telescopi-
cally—the saorificer looking through the orthodox
end, the ‘ sacrificiary ’ through the other. We
cannot even discuss the relative values of the
different kinds of sacrifice, for the value is created
by the circumstances. Still I think its depths
are sounded in the text running, ‘ Greater love
hath no man than this, that he lay down his life
for his friend.’ I call my story—
Two Telegrams.
“ Wish I was home, Tom ! First Christmas
Day I’ve been away since the old man died.
Reckon the old mother’ll grieve a bit to-day.
Damned if I’d a-taken the mob if I’d thought of
it. Let’s send her a wire, Tom—it’ll show I
thought of her anyhow, and cheer her up a bit.
There’s an office just ahead. Hey, Mister ! Shop
shut? I want to send the old woman a merry
Xmas. What ? closed ! Oh, well, send it along
in the morning, will you? Thanks. Have a
nip?”
“Steady, Tom! Ease the bandage, will you?
No go, old boy, it’s all up. That steer was too
many for us. I said when we first yarded him
he’d give us trouble. Just as well I cut in when
I did or you’d a-gone to the Never without time
to pass your swag. Ugh ! makes you feel creepy
to see your own blood coming out like that.
Wonder if mother’s got the message yet ? Sorry
I sent it. Feel a bit dozy—think—l’ll have—a—
a —a .”
“Did you send my mate’s telegram ? J ust sent
it? Well, that’s hard luck. Great Scott! what a
shock for the old woman. Here, I want you to
send another to tell his mother that he saved my
life at the cost of his own. He was killed this
morning.”
* * •
“So you think the greatest sacrifice is that of
life,” said the Pessimist.
“I don’t. Life just now is considerably dis-
counted by the trouble of living, and a man who
has a chance of putting an end to himself with
the honor of heroism instead of the stigma of
suicide is to be envied. We value most that
we have not. To me the highest sacrifice is that
of honor.”
“Pooh,” said Philos, “what is honor but an
idealistic bond of mutual self-protection?”
“Yes,” added the Simpleton, “and the loss of
an ideal is less costly than trying to live up to it.”
“Still,” said the Pessimist, “most men would
face death rather than universal execration—the
coward that wouldn’t doesn’t affect my theory—
his life has a negative value. I call my story
Just Retribution?
“ Was it without reason he black-legged ? With
a sick wife and six children—the eldest nine—to
keep on 10s. a week strike-pay ! You would have
gone to the pub. and forgotten them while you
drank to Unionism ! Ah, well! he didn’t. What
were your taunts to the hunger-glint in their
eyes? Their skin-clad bones cut deeper than
your stones ! And because he dared moral suicide
rather than actual murder you called down the
curses of the Almighty ! You stoned him to the
pit’s mouth ! You prayed the good God he might
never come out alive! Would you have thus
blasphemed had you known ’twould be even so?
And the coincidence you call retribution ! Bah !
The annals of Black-leg-land show brighter heroes
than your selfish souls dream of ! ”
• # »
“ How many of your heroes would have dared
their deeds had they known the probability of
futility—that their sacrifice was vain?” asked
the Simpleton. “ Here’s my own story : I was
in love once—in fact, I still am! Not with the
girl that is, but with the girl I thought she was !
You fellows, of course, can’t understand it, but
the sacrifice of life and honor for her sake would
have been easy. Why, my dead self was sacri-
ficed ! Yet she loved me, too—at the time ! But
there was an obstacle—chimerical, I thought it.
She held it unsurpassable, and so great was my
infatuation that I loved her the more for her high
principles. (Smile, Philos ! ’Tis a common varia-
tion of the world-old story. Only this—l do not
as usual claim pre-eminence in grief). Circum-
stances were such that my presence even occasion-
ally made her lot the harder. I left. Only the
felon who voluntarily closes his eye to the
single ray that for an instant illumines
his darkness can feel as I did. Still it
was for her sake—l was helping her. But
at last my pent-up passion leaped its bounds—l
knew I must see her or go mad. I saw her. The
weary months that had seemed an eternity in the
passing were retrospectively so many hours. She
held out her hand smilingly. ‘I don’t think I’ve
seen you since my wedding,’ she said.
“ Ah f my friends ! worship self-sacrifice if you
will, but, believe me, self-abnegation is the highest
form of altruism.”

Dear Bulletin, —Since the ss. per night
travelling allowance for N.S.W. constables came
into vogue (simultaneously with reduction of the
officers’ allowance), the officers leave no stone un-
turned to disprove the bona fides of the claims
made by their subordinates. ' For instance, if a
constable remains the night at a private house
where no actual pecuniary charge is made, but
where the constable has to recompense his enter-
tainers in some other way, no allowance is paid.
M.’sP., who considered they were doing the poor
bobby a good turn by getting him a shilling extra
per night, might well give this matter a little
consideration.— Trooper.

little fortune.

Illustrious brother of the sun and moon.—Behold thj
servant prostrate before thy feet. I kowtow to thee, and
beg that of thy graciousness thou mayst grant that 1 may
speak and live. Thy honored manuscript has deigned to
cast the light of its august countenance upon us. With
raptures we have perused it. By the bones of my
ancestors, never have I encountered such wit, such pal bos,
such lofty thought. With fear and trembling I return the
writing. Were Ito publish the treasure you sent me, the
Emperor would order that it should be made the standard,
and that none be published except such as equalled it.
Knowing literature as I do, and that it would be impos-
sible in ten thousand years to equal what you have done,

your pardon. Behold, my head is at your feet. Do what
you will. Your servant’s servant.— Tub Editor.
The Chinese equivalent of “ returned with
thanks.”
A London correspondent :—Reading in
a recent Bulletin about old Tom Stubbs,
the auctioneer (grandfather of Miss Maud Fitz-
Stubbs), reminds me that the old gentleman
carried on business in King-street, Sydney, for
many years before he went to Melbourne. Even
then he was celebrated for his florid ads.,
which put George Robins in the shade. Mr.
Stubbs was a great admirer of Napoleon Bona*
parte, and called his property on the Parramatta
River (at Tarban Creek) Longwood. It was sold
to the Marists and is now known as Villa Maria.
All over the house could be seen statues, busts,
and statuettes of the Little Corporal, and I have
in my possession a small bust of him which Stubbs
gave to my father. “Old Tom,” as he was called,
was a great musician, a gift inherited by all his
family without exception. Two of his sons—Bob
(father of the clever Maud) and Napoleon, the
second son—started from some China port for
California in the time of the gold mania—l
think in ’49. They themselves were on board
a cutter called the Rose of Australia; and
they convoyed a real Chinese junk, from which
they became separated in a typhoon. The
junk was never heard of, but the cutter was
picked up at sea dismasted with only the two
Stubbs boys on board, both lashed to the vessel.
They were in the last stage of exhaustion, but
they recovered and were brought on to Sydney.
I recollect well their arrival and the excitement
their adventures caused. One of the boys married a
lady who had had the awful experience of being
actually in bed with her adopted mother, Mrs.
Hoadley, in a house in King-st., between George
and York streets, when a man entered the bed-
room and murdered the old lady, the little girl
being all the time hidden under the bed-clothes.
She heard the blows of the hammer with which
the murderer broke Mrs. Hoadley’s skull. All
the Stubbs boys were handsome, fine-looking
fellows, and the daughter, Mrs. Walter Church,
was quite a beauty as a girl.

REFRIGERATION.
WE can SUPPLY REFRIGERATORS from the smallest to
'' the largest requirement, suitable for DRY COLD STORAGE

Simple in construction, cheap to run, efficient and economical.

60,000 LAVAL SEPARATORS in RAIL'S USE.
Capacity from 12 to 60 gallons per hour for hand-power, and
100 to 300 gallons for steam-power. Prices, lElfi upwards.
Using a poor Cream Separator means great annual loss in
mm ey returns. Several factories having discovered this have
put in Alpha separators, so as to get the greatest possible
amount of butter out of the milk, and with the least working
V
expenses.
