THE RED PAGE
A SYDNEY POET.
IN Edith C. A.’ Vivian, the Sydney girl
who died at Johannesburg at the age of
twenty-two years, there was more than
the promise of a real poetic gift. Her work,
posthumously collected by her. twin-sister,
titled The Pursuit of Poetry, and published
by TruslOve and Hanson, London (per
Angus and Robertson, Sydney) evidences a
remarkably precocious artistic temperament,
and her performance, sadly incomplete as it
is, contains work of a maturity and beauty
strangely ungirlish. Her verses are un-
doubtely imitative; Keats and Browning
wielded their tremendous sway over a mind
sensitive, feminine, young; her experience
of life was necessarily meagre, her outlook
narrow ; yet her feeling for nature is in-
dependently evident, her sense of music
spontaneous and true. And in her artless
and careless verses she contrives to create an
atmosphere ; within her lines lies an un-
analysable charm like that of Keats. Words
to her are beautiful and colorful things, to
be cherished for their own sake.
It is a happy bird
That sends its song sans word
Up from some quiet tree in the green wood ;
That singeth purposeless,
But just from joy—no less.
And changes mood
As easily as a fairy-courted fairy could. . , .
And as this happy bird
Maketh its full voice heard,
Without a rhyme or reason for its flow,
My pen I sometimes take,
And.let it rhymed words make,
Just for the slow
Sweet pleasure acts not planned nor reasoned out
can know.
For words have colors sweet,
And each one dips its feet
Into an ancient well of honey melancholy;
And if their ordinance
Be mixed into sweet dance
Unweeningly,
Oh, let them have their play and fall back
statelily.
The slight cloyingness of these stanzas
would probably have been restrained with
more mature years. The poem from which
they are taken was written before Edith
Vivian’s eighteenth year. Her level is not
high, she knows.
Alas, my level is so low, I think ;
Just the damp pool where cattle stoop to drink.
And all the mud weed-yielding, careless-eyed,
My small pool lets them choke it either side.
The subsets touch it sometimes, but a tree
Close by leans over laughing, and you see
Its shadow ousts the brightness, only here
And there the red gold touches ’twixt the leaves
(The shadow leaves); and ripples with a jeer
Bear them towards the greyness, which receives
And chokes them out. And then night reigns
again.
I love the night; she sorrows for my pain,
And lets one little star sleep in me, while
Her moonbeams sometimes cast a careless smile.
Even my wild tree-shadow draws and creeps
Off from me, keeps her leaves quiet as she sleeps.
Oh, low pond-level! But one thing I know,
That mud-born things appear, arise and go
Up to the sky, their wings have matched the blue.
The clever things ! I wonder how they knew
Down ’neath my water ’twas the thing to do.
But mud-conceived, yet full of perfect grace '
They flash themselves away, and into space
Absorbed, perhaps they visit, who can say,
My little star that loves me, which each day
Is hidden from me. Yes, I love to think
My low pond-level, where the cattle drink,
Can send them forth, as even this heart of mine
Sencjs forth its rhyme-spelt cries, its one soul-sign.
There is hardly a piece in the book that is
not redeemed from the commonplace by
some musical line. She speaks of leaves,
So green,
The flowing air makes green mist over them ;
of a child,
So white and delicate, he seemed a cloud
Formed from fresh-gathered dew, and touched to
red
A little by a sunbeam ;
of
__ , , The gleam
Of eyes that peered through darkness like black
dew;
of roses that grow
Petal by petal to a laugh ;
of the strange things of the ocean-deeps ;
Are they empowered with a water-wing,
Thick- membraned, bubble-eyed sea butterflies ?
But it is in her power to paint with little
touches an atmosphere of fantasy that Edith
Vivian shows her humble kinship with the
elect. “In some Lemuria, forgot, un-
known,”
So past and gone that now *tis only sung
By ancient ocean murmuring through its foam
And some quaint sea-bird to the tale hath clung ’
And cries it piteously before a storm ;
As a dispirited poet, who knows how to fashion *
A noble tale, but leaves out all the passion,
and in “ A Little Garden ” where,
The little fays in this retreat,
That ’stablish guard, and foes defeat,
Must walk with icy, small blue feet;
And pause to rub their hands with glee
In each small sunflake they can see,
Edith Vivian shows the spontaneity and the
delicacy of the artist. Here is a piece of
dainty imagery, marred by two lines of prose:
One day my tree
Turned her leaves butterflies, and set them free.
’Twas strange, the moaning from the barren air
That sink and fitted where those leaf-shapes
were,
Knowing the little windows which had fed
Her atmosphere so long with vapor, fled . . .
Poor things ! Their last act was to emulate
The butterflies, and this was done too late.
They had forgot the colors of their wings,
And so, dead gold, hard red, and barred -with
strings
Of a, sharp green, they fluttered down to earth,
Which suffocated soon their short-time mirth.
And here—from ‘ ‘ Thoughts Translated from
the Hearts of All Girls is a brief indica-
tion of her leaning toward the larger themes
that the years would have brought her :
My Lover, I sleep fast.
lam clad in night. And, Dear, the night breeds
buds,
Such wealth may grow in darkness. Wake me
then,
Thou Lover, with one kiss, and we shall see
Together, what sweet flowers a kiss unfolds.
But incomplete and immature as her talent
is, once or twice she rises from her low
pond-level, as with these lines upon “Wis-
dom and Friendship ” : V.
A great wind came to me, and wrapped me firm
In its most powerful presence. It did not bear
The scent of any colored flower, nor draw
Onward an azure-winged caught butterfly
Adrift within its flight; nor ever rose
A far dim drifted sound of melodies
In raptured mystery. It had not passed
Through a faint world of slumber, and of dreams,
Nor bore it any whistled cry the trees
Had given in wind-washed agony. It blew
Straight from a still clear heaven. I do not think
One star bad e’en slipped through it. Me it took
And placed high up upon a stone. . . .
The lightning went
Upon its journey feeble as glow-worm’s spark ;
And the full thunder raged into a sound
Like the meek piping of a mated bird.
Yea, rising up on tiptoe I could find
A looming other world or two, aspin
And laughing through old air. I never yet
On such a powerful platform e’er had stood,
Nor my meek eyes marked scene so limitless.
And by such sight made lonely, I looked round,
And saw some flower that dreamed beside my
rock
Its innocent life away. Ido not know
What color roamed upon it, but I knelt
And put it to my face, and clasped my hands
About it, and was safe from that vast wind,
Which in swift silence still did draw its flight
O’er that vast universe to hunt the stars.
A poem such as this may stand as Edith
Vivian’s title to inclusion within the fellow-
ship of Australian verse—and, compared
with the verse that has come out of England
and America during the last ten years, that
fellowship is no mean one.

"NIL."
A KGENTINA
The astonishing present wealth, and equally
astonishing future possibilities, of our greatest pro-
ducing competitor are convincingly indicated by
W. H. Koebel in his book Modern Argentina: the
HI Dorado of To : day (Bell, per G. Robertson,
Sydney). Argentina is a country of mixed
nationalities that apparently live in harmony, and
are in process of being welded into one distinct
national type. For the making of the Argentina
race of the immediate future this heterogeneous lot
of raoes have been flung into the pot:—The de-
scendents of the Spanish “ Conquistadores,”
Basque and Italian immigrants, the Gaucho-
Argentines—descendants of Spaniards who have
intermarried with the original Indians, Patago-
nian and Chaco natives, and the children of all
foreigners resident in the Republic. For by
Argentine law the latter, if born in the country,
become its citizens.
“The fascination which Argentina exercises
upon immigrants of all classes is probably unique.
. . . Within a very short time the erstwhile
stranger has developed an affection towards the
country which is all but patriotic. His children,
born in the Republic, Argentine by law, become
almost invariably Argentine in very nature.
They will speak Spanish in preference to English ;
indeed, if'their parents permit it, they will refuse
to employ the latter language at all. In all
matters concerning nationality, their tendency—
entirely foreign to the race in other parts of the
world—is to become oblivious of their British
extraction. In sentiment, they are more acutely
Argentine than their co-republicans of older
standing. That they may accentuate this they
will even serve their military term with
cheeriness, an experience detested by the
rest of the nation. If in Europe, Paris will
know them more intimately than London,
while, wherever they rnav lie, the blue and
white of the Argentihe flag will rouse them to
enthusiasm, though the Union Jack lea-ves them
politely unmoved. Thus these, together with
many other Northerners, go to form a solid
element in this surprising Argentine nation that
is in the making. This process of welding and
consolidation has been at work now for several
generations. In the towns the results are less
noticeable. In the Camp, on the other hand, one
may meet with Browns, Jones, Robinsons, Camp-
bells, and Mulroyds, who know no more of the
British Isles than the average untraVelled Argen-
tine, who can speak no word of English, and who
are loth to believe that their grand-parents em-
ployed any tongue other than Spanish.”
A curious instance of the diffusion of English
blood in Argentina is mentioned by Koebel. In
San Juan, where the Indian strain is prevalent,
many of the natives bear, say, the name of Batiz.
Batiz is merely English Bates; and these
natives are descendants of General Beresford’s
soldiers who were taken prisoners in 1806. They
eventually made their way to San Juan, and in-
termarried with the Indians. “The result is
Batiz, duskiness, and a little hut with mud walls.”
The case for a White Australia could not have
been more graphically put.
Unfortunately for their picturesque aspect, the
country is getting tired of revolutions, though
conservatives assert that the system is fairer and
more expeditious than that of the general election
as carried on in Argentina. However, even in
politics the good old days are going fast. “To
retire from politics with a purse as slender
as it was at the commencement of the career is
an act that is still regarded with admiration. But
it no longer evokes that stupor of amazement with
which the Argentines were once wont to greet,
such a feat. Indeed, honesty has already become*
more general, less of a fad.”
The Republic has a population of five millions,
and crams one million' of them into one city,
Buenos Aires. This great, modern, luxurious
city exists solely for the handling of the products
of the “Camp ” —wheat, alfalfa, maize and live
stock. The urban manufactures and industries
are insignificant. Thus in a country purely pas-
toral and agricultural there is one townsman to
every five of its population. We have hardly
done so badly in Australia. There is evidently
trouble looming up for Buenos Aires, the “city
of theatres, of restaurants, of vacuum house-
cleaners, of great railway termini, of strikes, of
giant advertisements, and of blocks in the traffic.”
For the strike has been adopted by the Argentine
with an enthusiasm due to the recent deplorable
shortage in revolutions. And as soon as a strike
occurs the Government simply declares a state of
siege in 'the city. However, the slaughter
of “blacklegs” and policemen in a strike
of Italians is usually cpiite in conformity
with the best revolutionary traditions of
the country. And, judging from an incident
related by the author, th% ethics of voting at
elections are dignified and easy. You may vote
twice at the same polling place—it may be a case
of absent-mindedness—but a third attempt may
cause you to be regarded with some suspicion.
And among the estaneieros there is this maxim,
“ When in doubt, send a pair of carriage horses
to the ‘ Jefe Politico ’ ” —the stipendiary magis-
trate and police officer of the district.
Some interesting facts are to be gleaned from
the book. Football is now the national game of
Argentina. “It is astonishing to view the firm
and settled hold which this game has obtained on
the general population in the course of a few
years.’’ . . . One of the Buenos Aires theatres
produces nothing but plays that are Argentine—
and our Australian drama is still waiting birth.
... The chief prize in the chief Argentine national
lottery is £90,000. But in two years’ time Argen-
tina will get on without lotteries. . . . Nobody
“ shouts’iin an Argentine pub or club; this im-
Eortant question of paying for drinks is decided
y dice. . . . There are baths in the chief trains.
. . . The improvement in sheep-farming is due
solely to the advent of Maorilanders, while the
cattle-dip has been adopted from Australia.
Modem Argentina is a well-illustrated account of
a country which undoubtedly has before it an
important rdle in the world’s affairs.
OUR SAUSAGE SERIAL
Authors did nob display so much eagerness to
marry Alice as they showed in slaughtering
Charles—-and there was not one description of
her wedding costume. It appears that, after all,
Charles wasn’t so very dead. He seems about
the only character that can’t be killed. However,
as he is now married, he ean be considered dead
once more. “C.S.G.” appears right in his sur-
mise that this trend seems more as if it couldn’t
than it didn’t. The author of Chapter VII. is H.
S. Mitchell, Brooke-street, Camperdown, Vie.
As twenty-seven years now elapse, the next chap-
ter seems an appropriate moment for the unac-
countably delayed appearance of the Missing
Will, the Faded Flannel-Flower, the Lost Child,
the Forged Marriage Lines, and the Face at the
A publication that deserves a wider than a mere
professional appreciation in Australia is Art and
Architecture (Win. Brooks, Sydney). Well printed
and exquisitely illustrated, this magazine is the
pioneer of a national architecture; it is rightly
concerned less with the public building than with
the simple and inexpensive Australian home. In
the past the dwellings of Sydney have been based
upon ideas of living, imported, together with the
plum-pudding and the silk hat, from a country
that is climatically the antithesis of ours. A
series of articles upon “ The Ideal Australian
House” puts before us suggestions for a more
comfortable and simpler home life. Simplicity,
coolness and ventilation are the main desiderata
of Australian dwellings, and Art and Architecture
is doing a national service in its insistence
upon .a, home that shall be typically Australian.
There is no reason at all in our. smaller'dwellings
for the heavy furnishings and oppressive stuffiness
of the houses of a country where the chief
enemy is the cold. In the four numbers of
this magazine issued this year there are to be
found a number of articles devoted to applied
Australian art, notably, in the last number, an
appreciation of the friezes designed by Harry J.
Weston. _ The ideal of a beautiful Sydney, too, ia
not last sight of, though the futility displayed by
the municipal authorities in destroying the
narrow-fronted buildings in George-street North,
in order to allow those same wedges of ugliness to
go up again, shows the uselessness of protesting
against the stupidity of the average alderman.
“ I knew a man once in Wininio, and his name
was Bill Smith, and him and me was-down at the
pub one afternoon, cooling our internals, when
Bill looks through the window towards the
station, and sees Joe Brady coming from the
train.” Thus Nathan F. Spielvogel (author of
A Gumsucker on the Tramp) introduces his new
collection of yarns, The Cocky Farmer (G.
Robertson, Sydney). The yarns are bright and
amusing ; the cover design is excellent. The book
is good Australian stuff. It should appeal to the
great good-natured heart of the back-blocks.
A second edition of Harold Hansell’s At the
“Labor in Vain ” (Gordon and Goteh, 6 d.) has
made its appearance, signalising the 11th thousand
copies. We gave the first edition our quite qualified
approbation. The illustrations by Ruby Lindsay
are charming. Australian authors, get your books
well illustrated, and you, too, may go yet into the
11th thousand. Also, you might consider the
advisability of putting an advt. for a furnishing
business upon the back of your book.
From Whitcombe and Tombs, M.L., comes a
nicely illustrated booklet about the Dominion,
consisting of photographs illustrating verses by
M.L. authors, quoted apparently without acknow-
ledgment to their publishers.

CHAPTER VIJ,—WEDDING BELLS,
Daylight burst through the keyhole, and found
Alice clasping her lover’s hand.
Bounding across the floor, she made her way to
the sideboard, stumbling over the corpse of the
Customs officer, whom Carruthers had slain.
Returning, to the side of Charles with a goblet
full of methylated spirit, she poured the contents
down his throat.
Charles, reviving, proposed marriage.
They turned to leave. ):
With an ear-piercing shriek, Alice fell back into
Charles’s arms. An enormous snake, escaped
from a menagerie, had coiled itself round her
ankle.
Charles cut away the ophidian with his nail-
scissors before it had time to strike, and bounded
aboard his airship at anchor in the right-of-way.
With a single blow of his scissors he parted the
moorings, and they soared aloft.
A terrific cyclone Wrecked their craft on the
spire of the cathedral. A wireless message sum-
moned the parson to the belfry, and, clinging to
the lightning conductor, Charles and Alice were
made one.
Congratulations and beer were afterwards dis-
pensed in the^estry.

“It is with gratitude I write you that I
nave now a splendid head of hair, both thick
and very soft, all owing to my having used
your wonderful Hair Vigor. I was almost
bald headed before I used the Hair Vigor. I
still use it once a day, rubbing it well into the
roots of the hair. I used to wear a skull-cap,
and I am very grateful to Ayer’s Hair Vigor
for the improvement it has made in my looks.”

“ A severe attack of measles
left my little Cecil with a
nasty cough. From the
first dose of Scott’s Emulsion
I noticed an improvement
in his condition, and now,
after a course of it he is
quite a different child. His
cold has entirely disappeared,
he is stronger and better in
every way than he has ever
been, and has gained con-
siderably in weight.”
(Mrs.) E. HUCKSTEPP
THE REASON WHY
He is Stronger
a The intense nourishing
power of Scott’s, which
simply forces disease and
weakness out of the system,
and puts health and vigour
in their place, is due to two
things: (i) the pure, fine
quality Norwegian oil always
used in Scott’s; (2) the Scott
process of manufacturing
TRADE MARK
it, which makes
it perfectly
digestible by the
weakest sys-
tem— the impor-
tance of this
is obvious! Poor
oils and indigesti-
ble emulsions are
useless.
Make sure of Scott’s by seeing “the
fishman with fish’ ’ on the package.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Ocean Song.
Just a song of rocky ledges lying low beneath my
feet,
Melodied in moving marches where Pacific
breakers beat, '
Grander far, Linnette, beloved, than the mellow
murmurings
Caught by sleepy bends at Beulah where the lute-
lipped Tambo sings;
Grander far, Linnette, and graver, yet between
the breaking seas.
Sweet with all the measured music of the wide
wave symphonies—
Voices of victorious ages only heard in undertone
When the surf is beaten backward from the green
sea monarch’s throne.
Not a crest is on the ocean, not a white crest on
the bay,
Save where sunken reefs are sleeping round a
little island-way;
Like the blue-grass of our valleys with the lighter
green of maize,
Rhythmic undulations only sweep in from the
sky-line’s haze;
Yet upon the rocky ledges, with his fleecy hair of
white,
Hark ! The king of all musicians in his marvel
song of might.
Hark, the king ! The moody monarch! In his
lightest fantasy
Waking anthems from the headland, songs of joy
and victory.
Crash and crash of smooth seas breaking ! Dash
and dash of spray and spume !
“Par enough !” the rocks are moaning; shouts
the monarch, “Ho ! Make room ! ”
“Room! Make room!” A crumbled cornice
answers the insistent call,
And a thousand fretted fragments to the weeping
ledges fall;
Never bird of land or water flits or floats across
the bay;
But the headlands south and northward bend their
hoary heads and pray.
Knee-deep in the foam that flecks them, scarred
and scored with ocean brands,
Living things of stately grandeur stretching forth
beseeching hands.
Song of Strength, the bridegroom lusty, wedded
unto steadfastness—
Sung for us who fail or falter, grander for the
storm and stress;
“ Earth is mine ! ” it flings the message where the
waves are eating in ;
“ Earth is thine, the strong, the steadfast; work
and watch and wait and win !
Prom the chaos of the ages, 10, the lands that I
have made!
Voices of the lost Atlantis, what care I that they
upbraid ?
Onward ! onward ! ever onward 1 ” Hark ! —the
moving melody—
Crash and crash of breakers falling, full of joy
and victory.
Ah ! the clouded West is sleeping, day has been
and day is gone;
Through the sea-salt twilight marching, spray-
white hopes come sweeping on—
Spray-white hopes, the offsprings dearest of our
darkest day and hour,
Thickest at the fall of evening when the clouds of
tempests low’r.
But I watch the distant headlands till, with
moonless arms, the night
Bolds them to her breast like children, worn and
weary of the light;
And on soft green swards of couch-grass, under
pines of sombre hue,
Here, beloved, till to-morrow, I shall sleep and
dream of you.
VIC.
E. S. EMERSON.
The Painter.
The sun is painting the harbor blue,
And the winter weeps behind ;
Our hearts are bursting the prison through
Where they long have been confined.
There’s a different feel in the air to-day
That doubles our strength—and more—
As we lie in the light and drink each ray
That glints on the golden shore.
We crawl from under our refuge dark
To the joys that earth can give ;
For the sun’s renewing the sinking spark
That lets us know we live.
We’ll soon drink deep of the joys of life
And scoff at its fret and pain,
For toil is easy and sweet is strife
When the summer’s here again.
For even sorrow the sun imbues
With feelings that entrance ;
And deep it paints with the glorious hues
That color the true romance ;
Our souls that lie in the grave will rise
To swell with a vigor new,
When the sun is gilding the western skies
And painting the harbor blue.
We’ll revel long in the roaring stress
Where the lace-edged breakers curl;
And we’ll soon see less in the way of dress
And more in the way of girl;
For loud will the surf-kissed beaches ring
With laughter’s joyous note.
And the Pagan picnic push will sing
On the midnight Manly boat.
So raise our praise to the golden days
And the harbor stretched below ;
Burn sacrifice to the cloudless skies
And the bare, brown cliffs we know.
For care sits hard on the heart of none
And our youth we may renew,
In the days ahead when the summer sun
Is painting the harbor blue.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor ivill carefully read and, where practicable ,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence" column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
two columns in length, or, say, SOOO words, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
Tiif, Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS. when the
address is specified and stamps are enclosed But no
MS. will be returned, or preserved, unless these conditions
are observed. When MS. is forwarded, without stamps
for return it 'will be understood that the copy is to be
destroyed if not acceptable. Personal applications for
return of MS. cannot receive attention. The Bulletin
desires, further, those sending MS. to distinctly under-
stand that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Jllaolc and White.

IRELAND AND THE AUSTRALIAN
TARIFF.
Ireland has settled down again, and the story of
frantic street-fights in Belfast no longer drifts to
us along the cable. Ireland is its old self once
more—a quiet, depressed country, ruined by
Freetrade, trodden flat by its great landlords, its
people filled with an intense desire to get away to
almost any place on earth where British rule,
and the British land system, and the British im-
porting disease are not. It stands alone on the
list of the white man’s countries as the one land
that is unfit for a white man to live in, the one
horrible example of depopulation, the one
kingdom which almost the whole native popula-
tion would gladly leave if the passage money
were available. Ireland under Freetrade drifts
back towards the state in which Julius Caesar
might have found it if he had ventured
so far—a bush or jungle, in which it may
yet be necessary to re-introduce the bear and the
wolf so as to fill up the landscape. Under the
Cobden policy fully half its population has
vanished in half-a-century, which is probably a
world’s record for depopulation, with neither
plague nor war as a disturbing influence. The
Irishman, in a national sense, is becoming home-
less, like the Jew, and it is a question if he isn’t
likely to become the more homeless of the two,
for the Jew is beginning to drift back in a small
way to his old quarters in Palestine, while the
Irishman still moves away. He is a reasonable
success everywhere save in his own country. He
is a useful citizen everywhere save in his own
country ; in Ireland there seems to be no scope
for useful citizens. For the land that takes him
in he shoulders a rifle manfully in time of trouble,
or else he takes command and directs the men
who carry the rifle, as did Marshal. O’Donnell in
Spain, and Marshal MacMahon in France,
and the Viceroy Bernard O’Higgins in
Peru ; but he begins to abandon the practice
of carrying the rifle in his native land. Just
now, when Australia is considering a new Tariff
Bill,’ it is advisable to review the example of
Ireland, for the unpatriotic remnant of Free-
traders’is once more urging Australia to adopt
the policy of Oobden, and if Australia listens to
the voice of the importer, then its case will almost
certainly be that of Ireland over again. In fact,
Ireland is the only case on earth which would
parallel that of Australia if Australia followed
the advice tendered it by Reid, and Cook, and
Bruce Smith, and Johnson, and Fuller, and
the Argus, and Herald, and Telegraph, and
Courier, and all the rest of the persons and
papers that run in the anti-Australian interest.
A little over half-a-century ago the United
Kingdom began to fool with Freetrade, but the
component parts of the kingdom entered on the
experiment under widely different conditions.
Great Britain then possessed the bulk of the world’s
manufactures, commerce, steam-power, machinery,
shipping, and banking business. After a long
period cf the most rigid Protection the world had
ever seen, it was first in almost everything. There
was but little gold in circulation then, for the
goldfields of California, Colorado, Australia,
Maoriland, South Africa, and Alaska were all
undiscovered, but Britain had a lien on nearly all
the gold there was. Machinery was in a crude
state, and in many trades it took 20 hours’ work
to produce what can now be produced in eight,
but of what machinery there was Britain had
almost a monopoly. Steamers were only beginning
to scoot on the face of the waters, but such steamers
as did scoot at that date were almost all British-
owned. Banking was limited, because means of
communication were slow, but of what banking
there was Britain had almost a monopoly. In the
first four decades of last century Britain was a
High Tariff country, while the United States
and Germany were both comparatively Low
Tariff countries, and the idea that American or
German competition could ever be worth
considering was then a matter for scoff and
laughter. Britain took up the Freetrade madness
with a light heart, even as Emile Ollivier went
into the German war. Its lead over all other
nations was so enormous that the idea of it ever
being overtaken seemed a jest, and the proposi-
tion aroused that merriment which is compared
with the crackling of thorns under the pot. And
Britain had the wonderful luck to persuade other
nations to follow in its footsteps. If Britain had
straightway become a Freetrade nation, com-
peting with highly-protected nations, the disaster
would, in all probability, have followed so rapidly
that the Freetrade doctrine would never have got
a chance to soak in. But France, Germany, and
the United States all took the fiscal craze
more or less virulently. For many years
Britain was the Freetrade nation that was full-
grown, and which almost owned the earth,
competing with practically Freetrade or Revenue
Tariff nations that were in their industrial
infancy. Then the greatest goldfields on earth
were found in British territory almost immediately
after the beginnings of Freetrade, and they made
Britain rich ; and the growth of railways, steam-
ships, telegraphs, and industrial machinery set
the slow old world going with a rush. Because
all these things happened immediately after
Britain took to Freetrade, their results were
credited to Freetrade, and are so credited to this
day. Cobden and his cult had prophesied pros-
perity, and lo! a good deal of prosperity arrived, and
after that there was nothing more to be said. John
Bull sat down and soaked himself in Freetrade
theories, and he became so full of the new doctrine
as to be almost incurable. He ranked in his
imperviousness to argument with the people who
hollered for two hours on end, “ Great is Diana
of the Ephesians,” and left the matter at that.
So when the United States and Germany
took to High Protection; and Britain, instead
of being a Freetrade country competing
with other practically Freetrade countries,
became a Freetrade country competing with High
Protectionist countries; and when it began to
drop back, in an industrial sense, to second and
third place, it looked round blindly for the reason
and didn’t begin to find it for a long while. For
in the old, stolid, BuLL-lilte manner it had decided
that the advantages of Freetrade were as fixed and
settled and definite as the four seasons or the
Established Church, and sooner than think
differently it would have ascribed its industrial
eclipse to the machinations of the Archbishop of
Canterbury.
* * * *
And meanwhile the dreadful example of the
workings of his fetich —the prize example of the
globe—was right at Bull’s door, and he didn’t
see it. Most of him doesn’t see it yet. For cen-
turies it had been the policy of successive British
Governments to kill off Irish manufacturing in-
dustries lest they should compete with those of
England. This disgraceful system had only
recently been abandoned when the Freetrade
and importing craze fell on Bull like
an avalanche. So Ireland faced the new
order of things with its manufactures just
growing up afresh, where Britain entered on
the new era with nearly all the manufactures
of the earth already concentrated in its territory.
Ireland, in fact, set out under compulsion to do
what Reid and Cook and Bruce Smith urge
Australia to do—to build up its manufactures on
Freetrade lines. And it failed, as every other
country has failed. The kingdom which carried
8,175,124 people in the last census before the
beginning of Freetrade carried little more than
4,000,000 at the latest enumeration. In 1841,
Ireland was almost as thickly peopled as England
—it had 251 people to the square mile, while
England had 273. Now it has about 130 com-
pared with England’s 558. In the last two
decades, before the beginning of Freetrade, the
Irish population was growing almost as rapidly
as that of England, but since then it has steadily
decreased. Of course, the gigantic exodus began
with the potato famine—just as it would begin in
Australia with the next drought, if Australia
were mad enough to follow the advice of Reid
and Cook and B. Smith, but neither the potato
famine nor the drought can be held responsible.
They are periodical happenings, and a country
that isn’t prepared to meet its own periodical
happenings might as well be dead. In
Ireland, a country that is sodden with rain,
the responsibility lay on the policy which
compelled the community to depend on
“the great natural resources,” and killed off its
rainproof industries; in Australia, which is
afflicted with drought, the responsibility would
lie —if this country were mad enough to follow
the advice of Reid and J. Cook and B. Smith—
on the policy which compelled it to depend on
its “ great natural resources,” and which killed off
its drought-proof industries. Whether it is flood
or whether it is heat and dust and rainlessness,
the result is the same in the end. The “great
natural resources ” are a precarious herd, and the
country which trusts to them is a poor affair,
which is probably the reason why neither Reid
nor Cook nor Bruce Smith go on the land.
* * * *
It is true that Ireland has many evils to
contend with as well as Freetrade; but the
point is that it survived every evil till
Freetrade came along. It has an un-
speakable gang of great landlords, but in the old
Protectionist days it had them in a still worse
form and still the population grew. It has the
absentee, but it bad him ever since the Conquest.
And the Government of Ireland has been far
milder during the sixty years of Freetrade and
depopulation than at any previous period since
the English annexation. The ferocious wars are
over. The persecution of the Roman Catholics is
ended. The British Go vernment no longer discusses
schemes for the extirpation of the whole Irish race
as it did in the old days. The period when it was
punishable by death for an Irishman to be found
east of the Shannon and his two alternatives were
“Hell or Connaught” is aged history. Instead
the ruling power now passes Fair Rent Acts, and
lends money to tenants that they may acquire the
freehold of their farms. But, despite all reforms,
the case of Freetrade Ireland seems incurable. In
Russian Poland, which is also a conquered land,
and which is, in many respects, the counterpart of
Ireland, a coarse and boorish Government does
acts of tyranny which would make the present
generation of comparatively humane English
rulers in Ireland shudder. But however coarse
and crude and heartless the Russian rulers in
Poland may be, they have grasped one fact to
which John Bull, with his Freetrade mad-
ness, is blind and impervious—that man’s first
requirements are food, clothes, a house, and a pay-
able job. So in its own coarse, ignorant, de-
mented way Russia has shoved along the mines
and factories and foundries and other industries
of Poland. It doesn’t believe in giving the Pole
a vote, but it has great faith in getting him a
job. And, as a consequence, the population of
Russian Poland has about doubled itself in the
period during which that of Ireland diminished
one-half. The coarse Russian tyrant who gets
the Pole a job is at least in a fair way to make
Poland the richest and most thickly-peopled part
of the empire. The British doctrinaire, with his
good intentions and his exploded slab of political
economy, is making Ireland a desert.
* * * *
Therefore when Australia is considering its
tariff it is well for it to keep an eye on Ireland.
Great Britain isn’t a case in point, for Britain
only began to experiment with Freetrade after it
had captured, under Protection, the wealth and
industries of the world, and had got a century’s
start of all competitors. New South Wales has
nothing to do with the case, for New South Wales,
even in the days when it preached Free-
trade most furiously, gave Protection openly
through the Customs to many of its in-
dustries, and surreptitiously, through postal,
railway and wharfage concessions, to many
more. But Ireland stands out conspicuously
as the one country which did, under compulsion,
what Reid and Cook and Bruce Smith, and the
Argus, Herald, Telegraph, Evening News and
Courier, and many other deranged people and
publications, urge Australia to do through volun-
tary lunacy. In the first place it got genuine
Freetrade —not the bogus article that New South
Wales used to have, but the real thing. And in
the second place it got this alleged blessing while
its manufacturing industries were still quite
young, just as ours are, and it set to work to build
them up under the system which Reid advocates,
just as Reid professes that he would have us
do. As a result, Ireland has been conspicuous
for half-a-century as the one white man’s country
on earth that is unfit for human habitation.
Private landlordism and private railway owner-
ship, and other things which Bruce (Smith
admires, have helped along the downfall,
but the Irish nation grew and multiplied
in spite of them till Freetrade came. The alleged
dreamy, unpractical nature of the Celt may have
hindered Ireland’s progress, but even the allegedly
dreamy, unpractical Celt increased wondrously
in Ireland till Freetrade happened. Ignorance,
unpunctuality, shiftlessness, whisky, and super-
stition are charged against the Irish peasant ; but
however these things may be, he managed to
wrest a subsistence from his country, and to show
a marvellous expansion in numbers till Freetrade
befell him. The theory of the Wilks and Dill
Macky push, that Protection and Roman
Catholicism are naturally allied, is folly. The
Irishman is Roman Catholic by the accident of
inheritance, and most Roman Catholics here-
abouts are of Irish descent; but the Irishman in
Australia is mainly Protectionist, not because he
is a Roman Catholic, but because his country has
enjoyed the only complete and perfect sample
and exposition of Freetrade that ever came upon
any white man’s country in modern times, and
as a result the great bulk of the Irish are a
people without a country save that of their adop-
tion—a homeless race wandering over the face of
the earth. In fiscal matters the Irishman is pre-
eminently the Man Who Has Been There. And,
unless the Australian Freetraders can explain
Ireland away, they had best hold cheir peace.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Sydney Wire-Netting Industry.
TheN.S.W. State Premier’s wire-netting griev-
ance has been a very cold and damp affair for the
last week or two. The public has pretty well
forgotten Joseph Carruthers’ heroic prigging of
the wire, and that most valiant advt. is hardly
mentioned nowadays. The High Court case, in
which Joseph is to put the feather of madness in
his belltopper and the straw of lunacy in his hair,
and address the Court after the manner of
“Mill’s Essay on Liberty ” hasn’t come off yet,
and very few people seem to remember that it is
ever coming off. Carruthers has paid the duty
on the balance of the netting, now that the election
is over. An attempt was made to arouse the fury
of the landowner class, and to make it raving
mad against the Commonwealth, by suspending
the distribution of the netting, under the
pretence that the price must be a matter
of grave uncertainty until the law decided
whether the “Federal extortion” of the duty was
lawful or otherwise. But by this time the land-
owners have mostly dropped to the fact that,
while the Braddon clause lasts, it makes hardly a
penny of difference to N.S.W. whether it pays
the duty or not, and that the great uproar about
“ Federal tyranny ” is merely Joseph’s sour, dis-
agreeable little advertisement; if he pays the
duty he gets it back at the end of the month
in the distribution of the Federal surplus, and
if he doesn’t get it back he doesn’t pay it,
and one thing is two-and-six and the other
thing is half-a-crown. So the landowners
told Joseph pretty plainly that his pretence
of delaying the distribution of the goods
till he knew whether he had or had not to
add a ruinous amount of duty to the price was
too thin, and Joseph, being thus bowled out, paid
the duty as already mentioned, and climbed down
from bis attitude of lofty reserve. It didn’t
improve things, either, when some of the intended
recipients declined the State’s imported netting
on the ground that it was inferior, and
scoffed at it as rubbish. As a matter of
fact, almost all imported netting is on the
way to become rubbish by the time it gets
here, being grievously deteriorated by tight
rolling and packing. Meanwhile, other things
have happened. The Sydney wire-netting factory,
helped by the new tariff, has engaged extra hands
and got new machines to work, and has increased
its output to nearly 380 miles of netting per week.
That practically means that in one act it has over-
taken the Australian demand, and has given
Sydney, for the time at least, a monopoly of this
great industry. After Joseph Carruthers’
clamor and falsehood about the duty on netting
being devised in the interests of “a Victorian in-
dustry ” this is a painful circumstance. And the
Sydney factory, which already employs 400 hands,
is prepared to turn out the goods even faster than
it is doing, if the demand increases. Furthermore,
it is sending out a better article than the imported
stuff, and it has reduced the price all round at the
average rate of £1 per mile, and it threatens
further reductions. It did this despite the
entreaties of importers, who implored the
local industry to keep up the price and
not make imported wire—even the stuff that
was imported before the duty went on—unsale-
able. Of course Joseph Carruthers can still
sell his imported netting, despite local compe-
tition, for the simple reason that he can give
unlimited credit at the country’s expense—in
fact, he can, at the country’s expense, give such
extensive credit that the wire need never be paid
for at all. Even the best New South Wales
industry can’t hold its own against imports that
are heavily subsidised out of the Treasury. But,
all the same, the Sydney wire-netting industry is
doing well. As a side issue, the management
rises to state that it is a locally-owned industry,
and that the statement circulated by Premier
Carruthers at election time, to the effect that
the profits go to England, doesn’t contain a word
of truth or a semblance of accuracy, and was
merely one of the many devices employed in the
importing and Stinking Fish interest to arouse
hatred towards Australian manufactures.
The Astonishment of Schumacher.
A few days ago a deputation of Victorian country
flour-millers waited upon Minister Chapman, and
told a tale of woe with regard to the new tariff.
According to the Government proposals, the
duties on milling machinery are to be increased ;
and the deputation pointed out, tearfully, that
the only result would be to make milling more
expensive, as the machinery was imported, and
would still be imported, there being none made in
this country. Also, as an afterthought, the
deputation pointed out that making flour
was practically a “ primary industry,” and
should have special consideration. The depu-
tation was introduced and supported by
Palmer, of Echuca electorate, the Tory Foreign-
trader who recently beat that good Protectionist
Kennedy on the insectarian ticket. A report of
this deputation appeared in next morning’s
papers, and it caused one man, in the words of
Scripture, to. “drink the wine of astonishment.”
This was Otto Schumacher, who, as soon as he
recovered, wrote amazed letters to the Age and
the Argus, pointing out that his firm had been
making milling machinery for years past, and had
fitted up scores of mills with the very latest and
most up-to-date plants. Schumacher said that
he was, in effect, almost flabbergasted at the
audacity of the deputation. But he was com-
pletely prostrated with shock at noticing that
Palmer was the supporter of the deputation,
because he (the astonished Schumacher) had
actually made the machinery for Palmer’s own
mill! And the ink was hardly dry on Schu-
macher’s letter before another letter appeared,
the writer stating that he also made milling
machinery of all sorts, and would be pleased to
hear from the deputation. Palmer has kept a
gigantic silence on the question since ; but one
miller wrote to the Argus questioning Schu-
macher’s ability to make every item required for
a mill, and mentioning two articles as outside his
range. Schumacher (who was gradually recover-
ing from his astonishment) replied immediately,
offering to take orders for both the articles,
and to supply them within a few days. So far
this has closed the incident, which is highly instruc-
tive as regards the ways of the Foreign-trader.
The man who comes badly out of the affair is
Palmer, who, being aware of the facts of the
case, let a deputation of fellow-millers tell shame-
ful lies without an attempt at interference, and
countenanced these lies by his presence. Palmer
knew that the story told to Minister Chapman
was a huge deception, a slander upon Australian
industry, and a scheme to discredit and destroy
Australian manufactures. And he lent it his aid,
it being apparently his business as a Foreign-
trader to destroy Australian manufactures.
A Dry Hint.
In New South Wales a prolonged spell of dry
weather has made pastoralists anxious, and cow-
men, orchardists, and farmers almost desperate;
in Victoria unfavorable weather conditions also
affected the spring, and there is talk there of a
five-bushel wheat crop only. There is no call for
any exaggerated pessimism over these facts. They
are normal enough in the sense that such dry
spells must be frequently expected; and
they need not prove disastrous, for they only
serve to reduce what would otherwise be an
unnaturally high level of productivity from
the soil. Australia is extraordinarily prolific in
good seasons. It is not subject to the long, cold,
barren winters of most other countries. Its
soil must get a rest somehow. And the
drought is the somehow. The present dry spell
need set no one calling out “woe,” but, all the
same, it is a useful dry hint from Nature to dis-
regard the advice, founded on booming estimates
of our primitive resources, that the Freetraders
make and use as arguments against a policy of
Protection to foster manufacturing industries.
“When there is so much money in wool, wheat
and butter,” they argue, “ why on earth worry
about making furniture or pottery or ironware?
Stick to the natural industries!” (meaning by natu-
ralindustriesthegrowthof wheat, which isa foreign
imported grain, its growth fostered in the first
instance by huge bonuses of land and money, and
now supplanting the really natural industry of
nardoo culture; the pasturing of sheep, imported
animals, which supplant the natural kangaroo
and turn us from the really “ natural ” industry
of kangaroo-robe making ; and the production of
butter, another unnatural, imported, bounty-fed
and protected industry). As a matter of truth
all industries are natural to Australia which
are not forbidden by the climate or by
the impossibility of getting the raw material
either locally or from abroad (the English
cotton industry, for example, is founded on an
imported raw product). The Freetrader argues
for the restriction of our national energies, not to
natural industries, but to a few primitive ones
which have grown to greatness in spite of him.
In the earliest days he doubtless protested against
any other sphere of national ambition than that
of guarding convicts and cooking for them the
food imported from Britain, and flogging them
with imported whips. Now, with a perverseness
but little modified by the growth of years, he
argues just as strenuously against adding any new
buttresses to our national structure. And
Nature, opportunely enough, comes along
with a dry hint that if Australia persists
in relying solely on the soil industries,


this continent will always be liable to painful
economic crises when the spring rains fail. The
hint coincides with the tariff debate, and should
strengthen the hands of those who recognise that
the wider the range of a country’s products and
resources, the greater and surer its prosperity. If
to the wheat-growing, the wool-growing, the
butter-making, and sugar-growing industries, all
of which were in the first instance protected,
bounty-fed, and sedulously nurtured through the
troubles of infancy, Australia can now add great
metal industries (the extraordinarily rich supplies
of coal, iron, copper, and tin indicate these as the
most natural of industries), great fabric works
(again indicated as natural by the fact that Aus-
tralia holds the world’s supremacy in wool, and
has in the North potential cotton fields of vast
area), and other manufactures, the rate of national
progress will be not only vastly increased, but
also “steadied.” The continent will no longer be
at the mercy of a “ dry spell.”
An Architect on the Tariff.
A prominent Sydney architect, Cyril Blacket,
writes
The professional man who thinks well of the tariff
and expects good national results from it—if he is wise
and wishes to earn a peaceable living in Sydney at
the present time—will keep his opinions to himself.
Such views as his are not in favor among his
class, however popular with the great mass of the
people Yet common gratitude to the land which has
fed and clothed him demands that every true Australian
should protest against the unworthy crying-down of our
country'.
I can throw some light on the Protection v. Freetrade
question from a study of the rise and fall of prices of
building material in Sydney during the last 25 years. It
will be remembered that about nine years ago foreign
manufacturers of wall papers combined and raised prices
25 per cent, on the retail selling value —which it is
reasonable to assume is fully 50 per cent, on the manu-
facturers’ prices. As this was in no way connected with
any Customs tariff we accepted the increase without
remark. The price of bricks has varied from 20s. to 60s.
per 1000, whilst timber has varied 6s. per 100 ft. Wages
have varied from ss. to 15s. per day. But as a Customs
duty was not responsible for these, we of the building
fraternity have made no remark. We knew well that
prices were simply increased because increased consump-
tion enabled sellers to obtain their demands. But when a
Customs duty is announced on foreign-made goods our
indignation is unbounded, because our local political
guides tel) us that the unfortunate investor will be called
on to pay the duty.
But if the question were fairly put and squarely
answered as to whether a Customs tariff will raise the
cost of building material, and will inflict any evil on us,
emphatically the answer would be “ No 1 ” even leaving
for the time being out of consideration the question as to
whether an increase of population is not of more im-
portance to this continent’s well-being than any other
subject, and the fact that the tariff, by inducing local
industries, will certainly attract population of a desirable
Class.
When cement was admitted duty-free into Sydney,
Hemmoor cement sold at 13s. 6d. per cask. The imposi-
tion of a 3s. per cask duty should, according to popular
argument, have increased the co r ' to 16s. 6d. per cask.
But cement may now be bought _,r Us. 6d. The obvious
explanation is that the duf induced the local manu-
facture of high-class Portland cement, and this may now
be bought at 10s. 6d. per cask—or about 25 per cent, less
than the price we paid previous to the imposition of a
duty.
The variable value of lead in its crude state makes
any comparison of the market value of the manufactured
article before and after the duty was put on very diffi-
cult, but it is beyond dispute that the duty induced local
manufacture, and the local manufacture has steadied
the market.
As to Australian marble, Mr. Jagger, the contractor
who built the Medical School, spent a large sum in opening
up a marble quarry near Windellima, from which the
marble floor at the Medical School was quarried. The
marble was in every way suitable, but the unrestricted
importation of the foreign article ruined the contractor.
The imposition of a duty induced inquiry as to what
marble N.S.W. possesses, with the result that to-day that
State stands in the front rank for brilliant and beautiful
marbles, which are so popular that the importation of
foreign marble has almost died out.
Flooring and roofing tiles, water-fillings, galvanised
iron, nails, paints, bolts and nuts, and other building
materials, may be instanced in the same way.
Unfortunately, much of the criticism of the tariff is so
unfairly put that it seems almost impossible to under-
stand the length to which a biassed mind can travel from
the truth. As an instance, take Oregon pine—which we
are told will be increased 3s. per 100 ft. Even if such
were the case, it is difficult to understand why we should
be enraged at this increase, for when the great demand
for rebuilding San Francisco caused sellers to put up the
price, we didn’t squeal. The real fact with regard to
Oregon is, that although if sawn up and dressed a duty
is chargeable, yet in the log it is free. The only difference
will be, therefore, that the pine will be sawn and dressed
in N.S. W. instead of in America.
Of course, no sane person will expect that special goods
which are made only by one firm, in a foreign country,
will become cheaper owing to a Customs tariff, but in
such a case asß. and S. linseed oi.'. which, on account of
its brand, commands a top price, it will probably happen
that the firm, finding that the raw material can be pro-
cured here, will start a local factory, and thus save duty
and freight. The tariff holds out a strong inducement in
this direction, for although there is a duty on linseed oil
in its manufactured state, yet linseed for the manufac-
ture of oil is free.
If such a state of affairs does come about, in this or
parallel cases, we shall obtain a recognised brand at a
lower cost than hitherto, in addition to the increase of
population. And, to the writer’s mind, population is so
urgently needed that, even if all the evils which objectors
to the tariff urge should really come upon us, and they
are accompanied by a substantial increase in population,
we should have every reason to be more than satisfied.
True patriotism consists in advancing the land which
supports you rather than some foreign country, and the
prayer of every Australian should be to fill this land with
a population of workers, and that before some other
Power finds an opportunity to do it in our stead.

“ Get Along With, the Tariff.”
That is the bitter, bitter howl of the Foreign-
traders in the Australian Parliament. “ Get
along with the tariff! ” And clumsy old William
Lyne, who can’t orate much, and who mixes up
his speeches a good deal, and who loses his tem-
per too often, and who, on the surface, does lots of
things that he shouldn’t do, isn’t getting along very
fast. For beneath William Lyne’s elephantine ex-
terior there is a world of wisdom and an ocean of
sagacity. He may rake down a good deal of
crockery as he goes along, and he may take up a
heap of room in his progress, but he arrives ;
while all manner of lightsome diplomatic per-
sonages who leap gaily in dancing pumps along
the political way don’t get there after all. It would
be a fool of a policy to hurry with the tariff.
The making of a tariff is a gigantic business
—all that George Reid ever did in all his
political career isn’t equal to that one job. On
many points it can only be tested by experience,
and Lyne is getting the experience. The tariff
goes into force, in a temporary way, as soon as it
is introduced, but it doesn’t come permanently
into force till the Act is passed. There ought to
be at least six months between these events in
order that the country can see how the thing
works. No wise man gets married to a girl with-
out a preliminary period of engagement. And this
is the preliminary period of engagement. The
rage of Joseph Cook and Bruce Smith and
Johnson and Wilks and the rest arises out of the
fact that the tariff is working well, and that their
case is growing weaker every day. If they be-
lieved the tariff was the bad thing they say it is,
they would want delay. They would speak
kindly to William the Elephantine, and tell him
not to hurry. They would say that the tariff dis-
cussion would do just as well after Christmas as
any other time, for they would be sure that every
day the evidences of the disastrous character
of Protection and the blessings of Freetrade would
accumulate, and the longer the final decision was
postponed the more votes there would be for
Joseph Cook and the fewer for Alfred Deakin
and William Lyne. It is just because every-
thing is against them that the Foreign-traders
want to hurry. The grocery prices which were
put up are going down again. The wire-netting
horror has been knocked out in one act; the Sydney
wire-netting factory is already making about
enough wire to supply all Australia, and it lias
lowered its prices instead of raising them, and the
quality is better than that of the imported stuff.
The tobacconists who decided that they would no
longer throw in a box of matches with the tobacco
purchase are beginning to resume their old prac-
tices ; on the morning when these words were
written this scribe bought his usual shilling s-
worth of nefarious cheroots, and the box of elee-
mosynary matches which disappeared a few weeks
ago shyly turned up again; and the same box
transpired again in the afternoon, when he bought
some tobacco to make a conflagration in
his sixpenny pipe. The people who
thought they would have to sit on the
floor because of the seven-and-sixpenny duty on
chairs find an unexpected rush of good, cheap,
Australian chairs. Persons who fully reckoned,
six weeks ago, on going naked because of the duty
on “clobber,” are being informed in whispers —
by tailors who, a year or two ago, would have
died rather than mention such a thing—
that Marrickville, or Ipswich, or Ballarat, or
Lobethal tweed is just as good as the im-
ported article, and cheaper than the imported
article ever was. The bootmakers who, a few
weeks ago, added the duty to the sham American
boots that are really made in Australia, are
taking it off again through pressure of competition,
and are beginning also to call the boots Aus-
tralian. The workman who, in the first week or
two of the new tariff, found that his pound was
only worth 17s. 6d., already begins to wonder if
it isn’t worth 20s. 6d., provided he buys Aus-
tralian goods. There is more employment,
more hope, and an upward tendency in wages.
The great Sydney anti-tariff meeting col-
lapsed so badly that the doors never even
opened to the excited multitude of 35 people
who wanted to get in—this despite the
“bob” that was spent on “refreshments for
Senator Neild.” The other great Foreign-trade
demonstration held in N.S.W. —that of Minister
Hogue at the Glebe —attracted about 100 people,
and it was only by the resolute action of the chair-
man in refusing to let anybody speak on the other
side that it was prevented from turning into a
pro-tariff meeting. State Premier Carruthers,
of N.S. W., went to the country protesting against
the tariff, and despite the support of the whole
Sydney daily press, he crawled back with only 43
pledged followers in a House of 90. The fruit-
growers at the back of Sydney are jubilant; and
there are schemes for starting a condensed milk
factory at Windsor, and the N.S.W.-made piano
is looking up. In Queensland the anti-tarifSsts
have almost given up holding meetings, for the
Protectionists got into a bad habit of capturing
them and giving wild cheers for Deakin and
Lyne. At a great anti-tariff demonstration on
the Westralian goldfields it took the most vigorous
and vociferous counting of hands to discover 43
votes for Freetrade. Under these conditions what
wonder that sagacious old Bill Lyne, who makes
a pose of plodding along like a mammoth while he
keeps his eye on everything before and behind
and on each side, doesn’t rush the Tariff Bill! He
is accumulating witnesses all the time ; and if his
leader will only stand by him, and if his party
will only realise the strength of its position,
victory is already assured. And what wonder
that Cook, and his friends, and the importers’
press, curse at the delay ! If the discussion had
started a month ago they could have fought the
matter with musty quotations from Cobden and
other corpses. Now there is the evidence of a
whole army of live industries to fight, and the
odds grow heavier every day.
+
Wool and the Importer.
Foreign-trade papers renew the old squeal that
Victorian and Tasmanian woollen mills are
“choked with orders,” and consequently are so
glutted with prosperity that they need no tariff.
This yarn was first fabricated a year ago, and was
then given a squashing denial; but this spring it
is again resurrected. According to the Argus
(24 fflVI) :
Gratifying prosperity has been enjoyed for a consider-
able time. The manufacturers can only turn out a
certain quantity, and all the mills were working to their
full capacity winter and summer. ... A Hobart manufac-
turer . . . was so full of orders that he could not accept
any new business. . . . The Geelong- and Castlemaine mills
are similarly embarrassed.
To which wild and enthusiastic statement, based
not upon a healthy gladness at the alleged “ pros-
perity,” but upon a mean desire to damage the
Australian factories by removing the duty which
Lyne has presented to them, there came these
replies :
From the Doveton Woollen Mills Co., Ballarat: “ Under
the tariff that was in force until last month, the company
was actually losing business. . . . The mills would be
delighted to receive further orders : if they could make
sure of them they would be enabled to extend their plant. ”
From the Ballarat Woollen Mills, Sunnyside “ Con-
siderably overdrawn. On the introduction of the new
tariff several of the big mills sent orders for additional
machinery, which would enable them to cope with the
increase of business expected.”
From the Collins Woollen Mills, Geelong: —“ Had to
cease the manufacture of tweeds when the duty was
reduced. Had not refused a single order for blankets
and flannels.”
From the Excelsior Woollen Mills, Geelong “ Would
like to know who offered the 4 big order ’ said by the
Argus to have been refused.” (But no one will tell.)
“ When the new tariff was introduced, there was a rush
for Australian blankets and flannels by houses which
otherwise would have got goods abroad, but they could
not expect to get early delivery when local mills had
undertaken previous orders.”
From the Castlemaine Mills:—“The article was pure
bluff written for a purpose. It is untrue that the mills
are so glutted with orders that they cannot supply the
demand.”
Even supposing that the Foreign-traders told the
truth (which they didn’t), they forgot to mention
that the mills which did the work have been run
either at a loss or at a starvation profit (see B.
12/9/’O7) because of the want of a Protective tariff.
The Argus makes an importer say :
When the tariff increased the duty from 15 to 30 per
cent. I had to cable countermanding an order placed in
England, because we would have lost seriously on it.
That sentence is a fine argument for the duty.
But the importer goes on :
This makes us all the more dependent on the Australian
manufacturers. ... Of course, the inevitable ultimate
result of the stoppage of importations and the under-pro-
duction and increasing demand locally will be a rise in
price.
It is just here that the Argus’s importer begins
to go as far wrong as if he tried to reach the moon
by digging a well. The “inevitable ultimate
result ” (and not so very ultimate) will be that the
Australian manufacturers will be able to do what
they dare not do at present—build new factories,
erect new machinery, and employ thousands of
more hands. Then, with the increasing demand,
there will be an increasing and specialised output
of what even this pet of the Argus calls “ popular
goods and of excellent quality,” and there won’t
be a rise in price, but more likely a reduction.
But something “inevitable and ultimate” is likely
to happen to the importer, unless he puts his
money (as he probably will) into manufacturing
enterprises, and thus becomes a useful Australian
instead of the foreign excrescence which he is at
present.
Where Neither High Wages Nor High Duties
Terrify.
“ Stony ” writes :
In its absurd gallery-play of sympathy for the worker
Melbourne Argus remarked (30/S/’O7) that, whichever
way you turn, you cannot get away from the fact that
wages cannot be increased by arbitrary means. The wage
is only worth what it will buy, and if wages are forced
up, commodities and rents will go up too. , r . , .
Now, the writer has lived and worked in Texas (u.o. A.J,
among other places. There skilled men w'ere getting
thumping good wages— 3idols. (say 145.) for carpenters,
and four and five dollars for fitters and such mechanics.
This in a part of the U.S.A. where the trolley-cars travel
thirty miles an hour —when it suits them—and where
there is electric light and ice laid on, and where the
nigger is infrequent, and life generally is joyful and
luxurious. Even in Texas, by the way, the unskilled
laborer gets from to 2dols. per day, according to
his toil. Where in N.S.W. (say) is the unskilled laborer
gettingmore(worth mentioning) than sixbobaday? In
the U.S. A., there’s never a bachelor mechanic, drawing his
four or five dols. aday, that has to pay more than4dol. per
week for his top-notch tucker ; and the IJdol.-a-day man
can get it for less if he wants to. This is “ boarding,"
which must allow a profit for the boarding-housekeeper ;
and it is no hash-house skimping, either, but full measure,
pressed down and running over, of pork and divers meats,
and beans of 15 kinds, and tomatoes, and slaw', and buck-
wheat cakes with Vermont syrup, and hot biscuit, and
greens, and roast turkey and cranberry sauce at
Thanksgiving—all in a country saturated with
the union spirit, and the “increasing of wages
by arbitrary means.” Wages certainly have been
increased in America by “ arbitrary means.” That is the
only way wages ever are increased. But the circum-
stance hasn’t brought disaster on the worker to any
noticeable extent. The Argos should remember that the
people of the U.S.A. have a full-grown tariff, that they
produce their own pork and beans, that they can those
things themselves, also that they tin their kerosene (in-
stead of getting, sayq an Australian to do it for them),
and their own green peas, and fish and fruit, and meat.
For this work they pay the wages which they have to pay
(when the unions get to work), and having nothing to
add but railroad freight and such matters, they simply
forward the goods to their markets and draw the cash.
All that the worker in remote places has to disburse,
over and above, are railroad charges, and even the rail-
road charges would be reasonable if there were national-
ised railways as in this country. Americans pay no over-
seas freight or importer’s profit or fraudulent impost “ on
account of the tariff.” As for rents, I have seen a township
grow up in a few' months in that same Texas, near the
seat of a new industry, and the growl about rents was nil.
The Argus, in its concern for the tariff-harassed worker,
is indiscreet in two-fold fashion. It insults the intelli-
gence of all its readers when, despite the examples at
hand of countries that have prospered under anti-
sw'eating and industry-fostering legislation, it predicts
misery for everybody from the adoption in this country'
of methods that have succeeded elsewhere; and as to
the worker section of its readers, the paper grossly
insults the intelligence of those people by its humorlessly
unconvincing affectation of anxiety as to what may
happen to them anyhow. When did the Argus —the brutal,
callous Tory Argus— care a straw for the worker, except
when it had a rich man’s axe to grind on his coun-
tenance ?
Getting Our Own Gun.
At last a move has been made for the local manu-
facture of rifles. The Australian Parliament last
week passed a vote of £32,000 for a local small-
arms factory. It is welcome, though it is a poor
little start, and is afflicted with that half-
heartedness which miserably characterises every
defence movement. The amount needed for the
rifle factory is known to be £65,000. Only half of
it is now voted. Evidently it is intended to
extend the construction of the factory
over two years, and it is thought that it
was necessary to break it gently to the Aus-
tralian Parliament that a whole £65,000 was
to be expended in this way ! That is not the
spirit in which the urgent matter of looking to
our national security should be taken. Genuine
reform can only come from a man who will wipe
out all the records and traditions of the past with
a brief “ we have sinned,” and begin a new policy
without a trace of the criminal sloth, stupidity
and indifference which made the defence of our
continent the last of thoughts in the politician s
mind, far inferior in importance to the newest
backblocks railway proposal. On this question of
rifle-manufacture there is very good reason to turn
a disgusted back on the past, and out of
loathing for its mistakes glean good resolves for
the future. A national rifle factory should have
been established with the first year of the Federa-
tion. It was necessary to the national security,
and it would have been a measure of economy.
At present we pay £5 per imported rifle (with the
certainty that when war is waging, and rifles are
more than ever necessary, importation will have
to cease). The cost of making a military rifle,
according to United States figures, is from six
to eight dollars. Taking the extreme figure, the
cost is less than 355., and we pay £5 ! These
facts have been pointed out again and again.
When Mr. Playfokd was Minister for Defence,
the present N.S.W. Commandant, General Gor-
don, made an offer to the Department that he
would himself form a company to make not only
rifles, but shot and shell as well ; that he would
supply the Commonwealth, at English prices,
with up to 60,000riflesa year, and he asked only a
bonus of £1 each on the first 5000 rifles. He did
not conceal the fact that he reckoned there was a
fortune in the contract at the price. The Depart-
ment refused the offer (which represented an enor-
mous national advantage compared with the
policy of importing rifles), but did not learn the
lesson that what promised to be so good a thing to
private capital was certainly a fine speculation for
the State, considering the financial aspect only.
Matters muddled along for a few more years.
Various estimates as to the cost of setting up a
small arms factory were supplied by various
incompetent civil servants. They were mostly
founded on the assumption that a rifle factory
must be built of marble, with majolica mantel-
pieces in rich profusion, and a suite of handsome
rooms for every official. At any rate, they were
all widely over the mark. And now that a sensible
estimate has been arrived at, the Government cuts
the miserable little sum in two, and proposes
evidently to spread the work over two years.
Drought.
The weather-experts are beginning to throw out
hints that a drought is just showing up over the
rim of things. The trouble, they allege, is that
the winds that should have brought Australia
rain during the late winter and early summer
went south and saturated Tasmania, and now the
winds have set in steadily from the wrong direc-
tion. Bo Australia has missed one lot of rain, and
there’s no telling when it will get the next
lot. But the commercial news had begun to
talk drought before the weather-experts
committed themselves to anything. The un-
reliable Cow has dried up promptly; and the
butter exports have slipped on themselves and
fallen heavily. For the 10 weeks from the begin-
ning of July to the middle of September the
disaster had been this size (figures relate to butter
shipments to Great Britain)
1904. 1905. 1906. 1907.

On top of that the prices of milk, cheese, flour,
meat, and other things have been put up; and
altogether the outlook is a great deal less cheerful
than it might be. There are about 75 lessons to
be learned from the whole business; but two are
enough to go on with, considering their size
(1) The “great natural industries ” of this country—
which are commonly supposed to mean the growing oi
wheat and wool and cows—are really about the most un-
reliable industries of all the industries it possesses.
Therefore, the scorn of the importer and his dupe, wher
drought-proof industries are suggested, ought to be
withered by a still hotter blast of scorn. There reallj
The Creed of Empire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Twenty-two members who belong to the trade union
group in the British House of Commons have issued a
manifesto relative to the Colonial Conference and allied
matters. The document starts thus: “It seems time
that the British working man protested against the ab-
surdities of some of the Colonial Premiers. It is realised
that the white population of Maoriland is only about the
same as that of the Birmingham district, and of Australia
about half that of London. Notwithstanding this, each
of these Colonies . . . assumes to treat with Great Britain,
with its 40,000,000 inhabitants, as nation with nation.”—
London Times. . .
Thirteen millions of the population of Great Britain are
on the brink of starvation.— The Prime Minister of
England.
So this is the creed of Empire—that we on the
outer marge
Must bow to the Shoreditch pauper when he
speaks his mind at large !
We bannered the sea with top-s’ls in the roaring
days of yore—
Aye, we turned our backs on Britain and trekked
to a distant shore ;
While the paupers wailed and shivered, w«
founded a nation new,
And stablished the flag of Britain on a continent
or two.
But now when we’d speak with England, lo ! the
Shoreditch pauper raves,
And we find that we are not freemen—we are
simply the Empire's slaves !
We have toiled with the axe and hammer—we
have slogged with a Titan’s will,
And the mark of our hand is written from Toronto
to Broken Hill ;
We have pierced through the sand-blown mulga
to the Cross and the Gascoyne Field,
But it seems that we’re merely bondmen —yea, a
helot’s dues we yield !
For the noble Shoreditch pauper, who rots in a
fetid slum,
Is the man who bosses the Empire and bangs on
the lordly drum !
We are merely the outcast people, and never a
voice have we
In steering the bloated Empire—“ Not much !
howls Bloggs, M.P.
Our hands are the hands that labored —by dint of
muscle and brain
We have builded the outer ramparts, but lo! all
our deeds were vain !
For the pauper who stayed in England is better
than us by far ;
And his voice like a spell prevaileth in the House
where the statesmen are !
Tho’ we founded a Greater Britain tlio we
toiled with hammer and saw
While the paupers whined and grovelled, still the
pauper fashions the law !
Yea, the foulest slums of London, where the
beggars and harlots prey,
Are the seat of the Empire’s glory—so the shrill
tub-thumpers say !
They are warning the British workman—who is
mostly in search of a job—
To beware of the Outland robbers who would
plunder his empty fob ;
Yea, the shrill trade-union person expoundeth his
dreary Creed-
Denouncing the Empire-builders as an outcast,
pariah breed ;
We have followed the lonely furrow to succor the
pauper pale ; 0
We have clothed the pauper’s carcase—and hark
to his thankful wail !
We are branded as upstart persons by the pauper
crew forlorn —
And the Empire-builder’s wages are the Old Dead
Cat of scorn !
There is room for a score of Britains in this our
sea-girt land,
But the party that shrieks in Shoreditch is unable
to understand !
He thinks that his paltry mud-speck is the hub of
the blessed earth;
So he girds at the new-born nations with a mad-
man’s dull-eyed mirth.
Aye, he howls in his frowsy hovel, ’way down in
the reeking slum ;
But he’ll dance to a different measure when the
Teuton pounds his drum.
And perhaps when a German army knocks loud
at the English gate,
He will learn that his creed is rotten—he will
jump when it’s all too late !
For this is his creed of Empire—that we on the
outer marge
Must how to the Shoreditch pauper when he speaks
his mind at large !
Lo !we bannered the sea with top-s'ls in the roaring
days of yore —
Aye , we turned our hacks on Britain, and we
steered for a far-off shore;
While the paupers wept and perished, lo! we
founded a Nation new —
Aye, we stablished the fay of Britain on a conti-
nent or two —
But now, when we'd speak with Britain , lo 1 the
Shoreditch pauper raves,
And ice find that we are not freemen—we are simply
the Empire’s slaves!

isn’t any sense in letting the superior importing person
have a monopoly of the scorn.
(2) Barring Victoria, there isn’t a State that hasn’t got
deeper into the bog of debt even during the amazing run
of luck they have all had ; and when three or four of
them, mainly by magnificent juggling, have produced
alleged surpluses, instead of wiping out past deficits with
the money they have mostly listened to the foolish call
of the S. M. Herald, etc., and have either cut down or
propose to cut down taxation, railway rates, etc., etc.
Now it looks as though a bad drought were making this
way again, and the same fool papers will, of course,
protest against increasing taxation, railway rates, etc.,
when depression hangs over the place ; consequently
there will be more deficits to add to the deficits that
should have been wiped out in the good times, but weren’t.

Exit Carruthers.
Last Monday Joseph Carruthers suddenly
ceased to be Premier of N.S.W. His resignation
was set down to illness, but it is an open secret
that the worst phase of his illness only came on
after the break-out of the fierce Cabinet dissen-
sions which led to his resignation. To all intents
and purposes it was the insane wire-netting
steal which ended Joseph’s political career—
for the time at all events. The Government
came back from the elections with only 43
pledged supporters in a House of 90, and several
of these have been saying openly that, though they
were elected as Government nominees, yet, if
McGowen moved a vote of censure over the
netting outrage, they would vote against the
Ministry. Only Carruthers, Hogue, and Acting-
Governor Darley were present at the hole-and-
corner Cabinet meeting which gave its deranged
sanction to the breakage of the law, so it
could hardly be called the act of the
Ministry, and a pledge to support the Ministry
didn’t cover proceedings of the sort. Some
Ministers are said to have been bitterly indignant
at the wily fashion in which the Premier took
advantage of their absence from Sydney to collect
his faithful Hogue and the scandalously incapable
Acting-Governor, and put the remarkable pro-
ceeding through; and when it became evident that
the Ministry was in actual danger by reason of the
silly business, their anger didn’t become any less.
There was trouble, too, about filling the vacant
places in the Cabinet, and it was freely reported
last week that the Premier intended to throw
overboard the faithful Hogue— the one colleague
who had helped him in his great act of
foolishness—to the extent of taking his salary
from him and reducing him to the status of
an honorary. A Government with only 43
pledged supporters in a House of 90 has to
walk warily and fish anxiously for outside
votes. The fact that the wire-netting business
was the point on which the Ministry was most
likely to go down made Carruthers the Jonah
of his own Cabinet. In the distribution of the
vacant portfolios there was too open a bidding for
new support; names were announced in a tenta-
tive way, and then there was a waiting for public
applause ; and the men who were thus mentioned
said they were being used as bait in an unplea-
santly public fashion. So the troubles grew and
multiplied till last Monday, when Joseph Car-
ruthers went out.

Justice Hodges, of Victoria, didn’t show up too
well the other day. Presiding in a criminal case,
the last on the list, at Shepparton, he sent the
jury into retirement at 1.40 p.m. on Thursday.
The jury argued pros and cons for some hours,
and at 5 p.m. notified that it wanted to inspect
the scene of the alleged offence. It inspected,
and returned to consider some more. In the
ordinary course the jurors would have been dis-
charged at 7.40 p.m. if they couldn’t agree on a
verdict before ; but at 5.45 his Honor announced
that the Melbourne train would be leaving at 5:56,
and he proposed to leave on it—presumably by
way of hint that if the jury was going to agree at
all it had better hurry up. He considerately ar-
ranged to be telegraphed for should the jury agree
before the statutory time had expired. What
was to happen should the twelve need his Honor’s
valuable assistance in elucidating some point, his
Honor did not say. The jury finally disagreed,
anyway, without his assistance. But seeing that
Mr. Hodges is paid to attend to judicial business
and nothing else, that his assistance might have
been required and is supposed to be of consider-
able value, and that, so far as is known, he had no
other judicial engagements that week, it seems
nearly time to ask if Mr. Hodges is tired of his
job, or what ?

One A. H. Hasell, an importer of Jap. manure,
has returned from a trip to Japan, and supplied
the press with two items of news. One is that the
god-like Japs “regard our White Australia policy
with a kind of sublime pity” and “can’t under-
stand what appears to them such selfish, dog-in-
the-manger tactics.” Apparently Hasell, the
importer, fully agrees with the Japs in this
matter. He hasn’t a word to say about
the Jap dog-in-the-manger policy which forbids a
white man to own land, or to conduct a retail
trade, or to hold shares in companies in Japan.
Hasell, it would seem, didn’t give back-talk to
the narrow-minded, unhospitable, dog-in-the-
manger Jap, and tell him that he first set the
example of exclusiveness. Rather, like a
good, unpatriotic, anti-Australian importer, he
seems to have just agreed with the Jap
that we are a poor lot. The other item
of. news that Hasell brought back is
that there is no need to shut the Japs out of
Australia, because they wouldn’t come here in any
case ; they are too busy in Korea and. Manchuria
to want to have anything to do with a place
“4000 or 5000 miles away.” Hasell knows this
because the Japs told him so themselves, and like
a good importer he believes everything that a
colored foreigner tells him. And the fact that
the Japs are swarming into the Hawaiian Islands,
California, British Columbia, and even Mexico’
makes no difference to Hasell the importer!
They told him that they were too busy in Korea
and Manchuria to go to remote parts, and because
they were brown he accepted their assurance. To
an importer brownness beats obvious facts anv
day.

“ Peter Pan ” writes :
Adelaide citizens have lately had a splendid example of
the beneficent regard Pat has for the public welfare. In
summer the dust in the principal street is a disgrace
despite the Holy City’s alleged “ magnificently-paved
roads ” and similar verbiage ; and in winter, after the
rain has been given a fair chance, the street is little better
than a hog-pen. I’m Oroweater every time ; but it’s no
use shutting one’s eyes to an unfortunate fact. The City
Council accepted a local tender to pave the thoroughfare
with Westralian jarrah blocks, conditionally on a pro-
posed special rate of Id. being agreed to by the rate-
payers. Mayor Bruce had declared the motion carried
at a meeting called to obtain the necessary consent; but
Fat jumped up from all over the hall and demanded a
poll, which the auctioneer had to grant. Fat battled so
savagely against the Australian wood that the necessary
rate was negatived by two to one. Had the jarrah contract
been endorsed, instead of the money going to a foreign
asphalt co., every bean of the price (about £30,000) would
have been spent in Australia. But such a ghastly proceed-
ing would have robbed Fat of his commission or something,
and, with righteous indignation, it promptly invaded
municipalism and squelched the whole show. Meanwhile,
the winter’s ooze is beginning to dry up, the dust
fiend has already appeared, and a big contract has been
lost to Australian industry.

The lack of discipline and order in the House of
Reps, stands out conspicuously in the pages of
Hansard. Interruptions are so constant that
very often what is supposed to be a speech is
really a dialogue or a conversation or a chorus,
yet a disorderly member has to interrupt about
20 times before the man in the chair even pre-
tends to interpose. As a case in point, Chanter,
M.L.A., delivered a speech on the tariff on 12th
September. Chanter isn’t a Minister, and he
isn't responsible for the tariff, and he isn’t an
aggressive character, so there was less temptation
to interfere with him than there might have been
in the case of some other men. Yet in a speech
that made 16 pages of Hansard he was inter-
rupted once each by Tudor, Spence, Mauger,
Forrest, Thomas Brown, Batchelor, Ewing,
Hutchison, and Watkins ; twice each by
Tilley Brown, Chapman, and Hume Cook;
three times each by Thomas and Bowden ; four
times by Fowler ; five times each by Johnson
and Bamford ; nine times by Hedges ; 11
times by Joe Cook ; 14 times by Wilks ; 19 times
by Foxton ; 26 times by the dreadful
Archer ; 28 times by the insufferable Atkinson ;
and 31 times by the mannerless Bruce Smith. A
strong Chairman would have had Bruce Smith
bundled out on his ear when he made his 20th
interjection, if not sooner. And, unfortunately,
the average speaker replies to all the 173 inter-
jections, whereby he encourages the persons who
had the usages of civilised society left out of their
education. A great deal of good would be done
in the Reps, if even a dozen prominent members
would bind themselves by solemn oath (1) not to
interject; (2) to take .no notice of interjections,
and to treat the interjectors as if they were dead
and buried.

In the remarkableness of its financial ideas the
S.M. Herald stands almost alone amid the world’s
press. It doesn’t know that Australia has a debt,
and therefore any attempt on the part of any
politician to pay off the debt that the Herald
isn t aware of makes the Herald mad with that
politician, and causes it to rush in with advice.
This, for instance, is from last Saturday’s leader
on the proposal to reduce the Victorian income-
tax :
. The amazing thing is that the old fetich, that a surplus
is the one thing’ desired in the financial government of a
country, takes so unconscionable a time a-dying.
Blessed by good seasons, Victoria has had so happy
a record that her accounts showed a balance
to revenue over expenditure of over £BOO,OOO
last year. Seeing that a surplus is not desirable
m public concerns, and that it invariably means that the
people are overtaxed, the proper course for a Government
in this position is to reduce the taxation.
Now, in the absence of a sinking fund and a
public works fund, the so-called “surplus ” is the
only means Victoria has with which to (1) reduce
the old accumulated deficit on revenue account;
(2) reduce the fixed public debt; (3) construct new
works so as to obviate the necessity of fresh
borrowing; and (4) repurchase land for closer
settlement (unless the land which was sold,
and the proceeds treated as revenue, is
to be bought back out of loans); and (5) the
so-called surplus is even then the only fund out
of which it is possible to repair or replace the
dilapidated public schools and such-like build-
ings, for Bent, in his alarm lest a slump should
overtake him, and he should fail to make ends
meet on paper, -doesn’t charge those essentials to
ordinary revenue. And with all these things to
be done out of a poor little balance of £BOO,OOO
for the year, the Herald rises up with its thistle
m its mouth, and, braying eloquently, says “a
surplus is not desirable.”

“Mate” writes from his good ship’s heaving
deck :
“ Watch Below,” on the shortage of mates (B. 11/7/’O7),
brings up a subject that demands attention in a loud
voice.
The English shipowners are doing all they can to create
a supply. They have asked the Board of Trade to reduce
the qualifications necessary to obtain a certificate, and
nearly all have increased the pay. This is clear evidence
they consider the position serious.
When the supply was plentiful, their cry was for better
educated men—men of some social position, as they put
it—and all advocated stiffening the examinations. If one
commented on the inadequate pay, he was regarded with
the eye of pained surprise, as a sordid and mercenary
person who didn’t consider the “ Social Status of the
Profession.” The prestige of belonging to “our Line,”
and the prospect of getting “ command ” in the dim and
distant future, were considered sufficient offset to wages
that about paid one’s laundry bills.
In my young and foolish days I interviewed the P. and
O. in London with reference to a position as an officer.
After much questioning as to my family and its county
connections, I was told to depart and obtain uniforms.
“ Millar, of Royal Albert Dock, will supply everything
correctly ” (at a cost of something over £5O). “In about
three months you will be appointed fifth officer in the
Indian service. The remuneration is £3 10s. per month.”
I retired, tears of gratitude making me unable to even
thank the P. and O. 00. properly, and next day signed on
in a sailing ship.
The Australian shipowners are doing nothing towards
securing mates for the future. They seem to trust to
the apparently higher wages to induce deep-water men
to go into the coast ships. I say “ apparently higher
wages ” because the difference is not great when looked
closely into. The deep-water mate gets cheap tobacco
and clothes—larger items than they appear at a first
glance. He hasn’t to worry about and save up for ex-
emption certificates as our coast men have, and he has
more to look forward to—the wages of masters in all
decent English lines being much higher than with us.

“ Her Love Against the World,” Meynell
and Gunn’s gorgeous Sydney Royal production,
still eventuates nightly and matineely, and is
likely so to do for some consecutive time yet. The
Sydney public doesn’t half mind sitting in a play-
house that is cool, as playhouses go these sultry
times, the while it watches Miss Mclntosh strive
heatedly for her love (Harcourt Beatty) against the
world (as personified by Gaston Mervale and his
minions). Wherefore the hour for a change of
bill is not yet.

That quaint mixture, “ The Ragged Earl,’
who wears his tatters at Her Majesty’s (Sydney),
will array himself magnificently out of his poor
old housekeeper’s stocking for the last time on
night; after that Andrew Mack will be
Jack Shannon—to the extent, that is, that he is
ever anybody but A. Mack. That matter of the
old lady’s stocking is, by the way, one of the
many things in connection with this amazing
“ Ragged Earl ” melodrama about which an ex-
planation is badly needed. When the poor old
housekeeper offers, in the best manner of the
faithful stage retainer, to hand over the savings of
a lifetime, preserved in a stocking, so that Mr.
Mack may get out of his raggedness and pursue
his love to Dublin, my lord is appropriately
pained and pleased all in one. He loves the dear
old creature, but he couldn’t think of taking her
money, and he goes off amidst loud applause for
the nobility of his sentiment. Later on, how-
ever, he is in Dublin and magnificence at the
same time, and he mentions casually to a lady
who wanted to know why they called him the
rggged earl, that the gorgeous clothes were made
out of an old lady’s stocking. So there’s a haunt-
ing suspicion that Mack has thrown in the joke
on his own responsibility, or that the earl gets the
before-mentioned tempestuous applause by false
pretences.

Except that the Tivoli now supplies
nightly a thrilling motor-car smash in place of
the jugglingGeraldos, there isn’t much change in
the Sydney House of Rickards. The motor smash
occurs at Dieppe, or some foreign place; and as
there was a flickergraphotographer handy when
it happened, he preserved everything for H.
Rickards except the escaping perfume. That
was pursued for some distance; then Rickards
whistled the dog back, and said that, as it had its
own Stinking Fish State-frights party, Australia
would probably be able to manage without any
imported odors.

“ Human Hearts ” cease beating at
Sydney Criterion on Friday. On Saturday the
theatre will be filled by a vast Anderson produc-
tion, “The Southern Cross,” perpetrated by the
same hand that wrote part of that monstrous suc-
cess “The Squatter’s Daughter.”

At Sydney Palace, “ The Yellow Peril ” is
announced for Saturday evening, Oct. 5. On the
city hoardings the amber danger appears as
a bright-blue Chinaman, with ferocious claws,
and teeth calculated to make a child
scream. The yellowness is a background for
the lettering, saying that the Peril is due.
Mr. Charles W. Taylor is responsible for the
announcement that the production of the prim-
rose threat will be the most gorgeous effort
of modern stage craft. Costumes have been
specially imported from China, no doubt before
they could be tariffed. The scene opens in an
English rose garden. Thence its action leap-
frogs over all obstacles to China. But it doesn’t
drowse on land. There’s a fight on board a junk,
between Chinese troops and British blue jackets,
which sounds thrilling. So long as someone else
does the work this fierce weather, Sydney doesn’t
mind leaning back and looking on—at the work
and fight.
Wonderland reopens its city at Bondi on
Saturday, with a startling bunch of novelties,
pageants and shows. All the winter Pro-
prietor Anderson and a lot of keen-faced young
Australians have been sitting behind locked doors,
with an armed guard at every window pane, for-
mulating plans for the air-ship which is to
travel from cliff to cliff over the boiling tide that
rushes up around the feet of Wonderland City,
and which is always the right temperature for
bathing. The dirigible ship will carry passengers
who are desirous of thrills before the Day of
Judgment. Side shows, surprises, music, and
ice-creams will have part in the programme.

“The Dairy Maids,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melbourne), rush along, full steam ahead, and the
shouts of mirth from audiences are like ship sirens
gone mad in a harbor on an anniversary. There
are even folk left who let out a horrible yell at
the Lauri-Clifton jest, “Then you think the
Doctor a profligate?” “No, Mum; a Presby-
terian.” And just so long as these maniacs are at
large, so long will comic opera ring-in that painful
gag. The country damsels in Arcadian and im-
possible frocks and gold-heeled slippers (just the
thing for a Cow Shed) show no signs of disbanding
or of deserting their rural butter-patting.

The Butt-Rumfords finished their trium-
phal Melbourne season with a flourishing matinee
on Thursday, and departed with a gracious pro-
mise of more when the Cup carnival comes to
pass. The early section of the concert was a half-
mast affair full of religiosity and solemn churchi-
ness. The Rumford wailed about Death four
different times with artistic but funereal pathos,
and the continued lack of the Smile caused
a serious blank—like unto an eclipse of a
heavenly light. The Barre violinist played
an Adagio Religioso, and the pianist worked
with the solemnity of a comic artist, Mrs.
Clara sang two Schubert songs (also about
Death). She sang in German, with fine effect;

French words, in little French songs, as sung by
ylara, plod along with elephantine tread. The
interval, in some miraculous way, changed the
spirit of the programme into a subtle and light-
some vein, and the Butts gave a more artistic
show than they had perpetrated in the whole
previous season.

exciting adventures. On Saturday, “Monsieur

The Coward Picture concerts again pre-
sent themselves at Melbourne Town Hall. On
Saturday a full house got more than the worth of
its money. The performers were pretty mostly
of the trousered sex, a quartette of boys being
added to the original harmonist trio. The male
voices warbled some part-songs with satisfactory
results. Indeed, one could support more of their
music. After a long course of the jammy ballad
beloved of soulful soloists, such simple sen-
timent and quaint melody come as a relief.
Mr. Percy Coward sang in his astounding
alto a Scawtch song or so; and Miss
Nellie Gordon voiced some others, which gave the
evening quite an oatmealy atmosphere. Mr.
Avalon Collard resuscitated some moribund jests
with great success, and the animated pictures
almost jumped off the sheet in more than one
instance.

At Prahran Town Hall, on Thursday,
“Ye Olde Crow,” an original opera by Cyril
Brinkley, was produced for the first time. Its
plot is an arrant absurdity located at an En-
glish village inn, apparently in the 18th century.
A nobleman and his son (who resembles an amor-
ous lobster) make a rendezvous with a fire-eating
General and his daughter, at the “ Olde Crow ”
pub. Previously the juniors have exchanged
“photos” (a premature proceeding, surely, a
hundred years ago !). On the strength of these
anachronisms, they have tumbled into love with
each other, and their parents meet for the pur-
pose of arranging their union. The innkeeper
gets the hang of these frayed circumstances. He
attempts to keep the two families apart, while
his daughter makes overtures to the lord-
ling and his own son woos the heiress.
Upon this loose and rusty nail are hung
three hours of astonishingly sad buffoonery and
fatuous dialogue. The music, however, rises far
above the banality of its inspiration. The plot
prevents its being particularly characteristic, but
usually it is virile and melodious, though some
solo numbers are shadowed by the wraiths of
popular successes. But all the choruses are
tolerable—one or two are undeniably good-—and
two love-songs approach the old standards of
opera-bouffe. The company which sang the opera
was bad. Not one individual quite fulfilled even
amateur requirements, and it says much for the
score that it withstood such evil treatment. The
very youthful composer has aspired to something
akin to Offenbach. With continued earnestness
and some assistance, he may become Brinkley,
and mean more to Australia than the German
gentleman ever did, or will.
The Melbourne Opera House programme
is beginning to look a lot better. On Saturday
the four Geraldos commenced to scintillate with
great success. The admirable neatness of their
Indian club juggling, their smart ’Murkan hair-
dressing, the high-waisted pantaloons of the
eldest jougleur, and the fantastic humor of the
Geraldo who strayed out of a Beardsley drawing,
all combine to make the act the smartest
seen for quite a while. The Whiteleys also
are rare. At least, the troupe’s “lady” is.
By the way, on closer observation, “she”
appears to be anything but a lady. In fact,
“she” shows every indication of being one
of the natural enemies of the sex that wears
skirts, being exactly like a prodigiously strong
young man in manner, method, and leg contours.
But “her” feats of strength amply atone for any
discrepancy ’twixt garments and sex. Ernest Fitts
and Eileen Lyons still chortle ballads. Carden
Wilson scores with his mimicries. And Tom
Dawson continues proving that he’s as funny as
WootWell, only he’s an Australian. Next Satur-
day “La Sylphe,” a new classical dancer with an
incredible figure, will step her measure.

Saturday night saw the seventh Australian
drama, “ The Great Rescue,” unfold its classic
beauties at Melbourne Royal. The play is
L. J. Carter’s effort, “ Bedford’s Hope,” adapted
to Bland’oltian purposes by an unknown hand.
It throngs with amorous aristocrats and with
working men, willing and anxious to forego their
wages, if only they can assist the beloved boss.
It contains villains of the blackest hue who not
only have vulgar manners, but have long lists of
murders, assaults and bigamies to their credit.
Also it abounds in emotional, huggable heroines,
of the kind most frequently found in mining town-
ships—damsels whose deportment declares careful
training, and whose frocks claim European origin.
And there is a crazed Kanaka and a Chinese
house-boy.

Bill Bedford, mining investor, has sunk
£30,000 in a mine called the Wombat, which (this
information is culled from the drama !) takes its
name from an indigenous animal. At the rising
of the curtain, England, Oireland, and Scotland,
in the person of three Wombat employees, are
on top awaiting the arrival of Bill and some of his
toney cobbers. The international trio make them-
selves ridiculous, until Australia, in the person of
Bill, takes up the running. Then a scoundrelly
squatter makes a scowling appearance. He hates
Bill, ’cos that enterprising chap beat him at last
elections. And amongst the guests of Bill,


Modern Saw Mill Machinery.
WILLIAM FLEMING, Equitable Building, Sydney.
M.L. A., he encounters a buxom widow who has
buried two of his victims, and knows all about his
past, which could be catalogued as blanky.
As soon as the party has gone down
into the bowels of the Wombat, he blows
up the machinery with a handy explosive.
The workers hurriedly come up in the packing
box which represents the cage, followed
presently by the visitors. It is then disclosed
that Bill is below rescuing two miners. He
succeeds, but owing to the exigencies of the
drama, stays down long enough to be flooded into
the only corner of the works that isn’t submerged
by an inrush of water. A local Diver Hughes
goes down and rescues him from a fine scenic
illusion.
9 * * *
Later the squatter-ciiap gets Bill to assign
him 10,000 shares, in the apparently barren
Wombat. Two minutes after Bill discovers that
the blessed mine is just yellow with gold. Great
consternation ! The fat capitalist has already
rushed off to get delivery of the scrip, cutting
telegraph wires, and accusing Alice Bedford’s
lordly fiance of murder as he goes along. Bill
and his daughter and the superiah suitor just
arrive at the railway depot in time to see the
ruffian steam off in the express to Townsville.
The lordlet is detained by a Charters Towers
copper on the murder charge ; so Bill and Alice
continue the pursuit. They start off without
gloves, goggles, or any other details, in a one dog-
power nursery motor-car to race the train to
Townsville. Of course, the toy car beats the
Government conveyance, and Bill Bedford puts
the kybosh on the narked squatter, who inciden-
tally gets gaoled.
* * * *
The scenery throughout can only be called
superb. Artist Brunton has surpassed himself.
In particular the patent scenery in the motor race
is beautiful. The actors don’t get a chance to
compete successfully with Brunton’s efforts. They
have only fatuities to utter. All the same, Miss
Ross is charming as an 18-year-old girl, and Miss
Harrie Ireland makes a high-class comedy widow.
Albert Norman does the virtuous English youth
to advantage. Styan and Leslie Woods give fine
portraits of the wicked Hooker and his son, and
Bland himself makes a huge hit as Bedford.

“ Why Woman Sins” is a problem pro-
pounded by the Holloway Co. at Melbourne
Bijou. It gives no lucid explanation, evidently
considering it would be superfluous. The play
throws a lurid illumination upon the morals of
the King’s Navee. Captain Carlton, R.N., starts
the rock of circumstance rolling with an offer of
his black heart and his red hand to the heroine,
and by the murder of her pa. He blames that
little escapade on to her lover, a brother officer
named Maxwell. Later, just to show his origin-
ality and enterprise, he incarcerates them both in
a Plymouth dungeon, where he leaves them to
starve to death. Their friends, who are
in the comic-relief business, rescue them
with a plug of dynamite applied to the
right place. Then the heroic Maxwell is
sent to Dartmoor to do a life sentence for the
murder of his best girl’s daddy. He is freed on
the unsupported statement of a dying convict.
Then he goes in search of Captain Carlton, R.N.
He finds him suffering from pains in the tummy
induced by poison, and pains in the conscience
caused by the spectre of the deceased parent and
the stiffening corpse of his paramour. The
wicked Captain hastens to die dramatically, and
the heroic couple clasp each other in a triumphant
ecstasy.
* * * *
The play is a lovely exposition of psy-
chology. The villain is a degenerate—driven into
crime by his diseased nerves. The talented
gentleman who represents him depicts the
character as an epileptic. He takes a Sadistic
interest in agony, and has fits after every exercise
of his natural gifts in the homicidal direction.
His female accomplice is an hysterical subject,
whose maternal instincts are cankered by her appe-
tite for excitement.* The hero is a natural-born
hero —an epicene creature, with an aptitude for
tearful outbursts, and no initiative nor resource.
And the heroine is his female counterpart. The
drama is not enhanced by its scientific interest to
any marked extent. Its other issues are tangled
up by the subtleties of the psychopathic specimens,
and the question of “ Why Woman Sins” is left to
be solved by the lady who gets found out.
* * * *
As the imbecile hero, Harry Sweeney is
unnecessarily good. In the tomb-scene his acting
is quite poetic. C. R. Stanford plays a serio-
comic convict with art, making him into a real
human being suffering from arrested mental
development. W. J. Taite is a villain who lisps
convincingly. Godfrey Cass is as debonair in a
foolish part as if he’d never been a rogue in all his
stage career. Miss Beatrice Holloway looks her
prettiest: and Hans Phillips makes a cheerful
reappearance, as a low-comedy gardener, in a
sailor-suit.

The Souter and Wynne-Jones Japanese
opera, “The Grey Kimona,” is having atrial trip
at Adelaide Royal. It brings in anything that
seems likely to attract, including bioscope pic-
tures, and most of the Tin-can Band from “The
Fatal Wedding.” There are good points about
the grey garment. Other Adelaide shows (mostly
at “ two and one” prices) have been Skuthorpe’s
rough-riding contests, the Tivoli (with pictures),
the All Blacks (with pictures), and sundry con-
certs, by a choir of 1100 voices from the city and
suburban schools.
Thos. Bent says he is on the eve of spend-
ing millions in buying back Western District land
from the great Victorian squatters, and spreading
his closer settlement scheme generally, and he
talks threateningly of a heavy land-tax looming
in the dim blue-hazed distance. Evidently Bent’s
idea of a cute policy is to buy the land first and
stick on the tax afterwards, so as to reduce the
value, of the land he has bought. At present Vic-
torian land values are boosted out of sight by
unexampled prosperity and artificial scarcity, and
every time Bent yells that he is going to buy, he
gives the price another shunt upwards. The
policy of locking the stable after the horse is
stolen is glittering acumen compared with Bent’s
idea. Bent proposes to wait till the horse is
stolen, and then burn down the stable to add to
the loss. After that, he will buy back his own
stolen horse at an advance.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ 0.5. G.” writes briefly from Coventry (England): " I’ve
got a picture showing Pansy Montague as Lady Godiva.
It’s a blitherer.”
Apropos “La Milo,” and other plump, prepossessing
young ladies now amassing fortunes in London by the
simple process of taking off most of their clothing, the
following, from an article on “ Attitude ” in Blackie’s
Encyclopaedia, is of timely interest: “At the end of the
eighteenth century the celebrated Lady Hamilton began
the practice of exhibiting attitudes, and as every art
begins with imitation, she imitated with great talent the
attitudes of antique statues in many large towns of
Europe, and consequently Sir William Hamilton could
say that he possessed in his wife a whole collection
of antiques. Her dress was a simple tunic,
fastened with a ribbon tight under ber breast,
and a shawl. With these she imitated all the
different draperies. Mr. Rehberg drew her atti-
tudes, and published them in London. On the continent
of Europe this art was carried to much perfection by Mrs.
Ilendel Schutz, who exhibited the most beautiful atti-
tudes, copied from the Greek, Egyptian, Italian, and
German styles of art. But not being satisfied with imita-
tions, she invented many attitudes, which were declared
bv all the critics of the day (including Goethe) to be some
of the finest productions of art. Her attitudes were
drawn and published by Peroux and Ritter in 1809.” It
seems from the foregoing that Nelson’s fair lady was the
first to go a-Milo-ing; and that everything connected
with it, even down to the plea that the scanty garb is
assumed in the sacred cause of Art, is fairly ancient.
“Bloggs”: In sooth, what Andy Mack doesn’t know
about advertising and the art of making his show dis-
cussed isn’t worth putting into a beggar’s hat. In “ The
Ragged Earl” Andrew croons a rather fetching little
lullaby—the sort whose chorus it is desirable the gallery
should learn and render. As the gallery was slow in
dropping to this part of its business, a gang of strident-
voiced youths has been specially chartered and planted
near the roof, where, at the correct moment, they croon
the melody with vim and 50 tram-power violence.
fervent Irishmen who have never been in Ireland in their
lives lean back blissfully and say it’s just like Connemara,
and when somebody offers, as an amendment, the theory
that it is more like Hell, there is quite an unpleasantness.
DEAKIN. LYNE. BENT.
These are pictures of Deakin, Lyne and Thomas Bent from The
Tailor and Cutter (a clothes-paper published in London). The
picture of Thos. Bent explains how kings are made so beautiful in
the London press.
The two lions that roar along the beach are never quite
as fierce towards each other as two lionesses can be in
like circumstances. There are two leading ladies in one
Australian dramatic company of note, and as they are
running neck and neck for first place, their ferocity is
like that of a body of Bulgarians invading Macedonia.
The management that places two actresses in this posi-
tion invites trouble. This one gets it, and gets it in
its most heated form, for the artistes are not
above tearing clothes and hurling furniture, and when
one is on the stage and the other off, the latter
stands in the wings and hisses her performing sister.
This hissing and the other sounds of enmity and strife
have penetrated to the audience ; also the clamor that
ensues when the rash manager expostulates with a
heated actress. One of these nights the two ladies will
get at each other on the stage, and then the audience
will see a fine wrestling match run on plain scratch-as-
cats-can principles, and it will go away feeling glad and
saying that it has got good value for its money.
“ Ten 2 4”: Almost every theory to account for Melba’s
prolonged dive into seclusion in these parts has been
advanced barring what is probably the correct one. Few
people realise that Melb.i’s repertoire is very limited.
Mimi, Juliet, Marguerite, and a couple more, and the
list of grand opera roles she plays is exhausted. Melba’s
ambition is towards Wagner, and to perpetrate Wagner
effectively even such a genius as Melba needs months of
close study. Women of the Melba brand of physique
and nerve don’t require rest and quiet and seclusion
(which are the things the songstress is said to be pursuing)
any more than do Chinamen or prize-fighters—in fact,
these things worry them, and are among the few matters
on earth capable of bringing on an attack of hysterics.
In this scribe’s view the lady with the mighty voice pro-
poses to emerge from Ercildoun in time for the next
Fogtown season with an extensive Wagner repertoire—
and if she proposes that, it’s done.
Dear Bulletin. —Are not the Rumford-Butts overdoing
the “domesticity” business? It is nice to learn that
they have brought little Bubba and Tootles with them,
and a nurse. Australia throbs to the roots of its gum
trees when it hears how Tootles and Bubba stood the
train and all the pretty ships, and it has smiled be-
nignantly when told of the clever things Bubba and
Tootles said and did. But when the shops are filled with
photos of Mrs. Rumford with Bubba and Mr. Rumford
with Tootles, is it not time to mention that the gifted
couple are here to sing ; and if they can sing (and the
present writer knows that they both can, divinely), what
the dickens do they want with tricks which have had per-
force to be resorted to by passe prima donnas, and con-
traltos beyond their prime, and tenors who have long ago
swallowed their voices with their beer, and basses with
police-court records? Let us have less of Budge and
Toddie, and more (if there can be more) of the adorable

Sarah Bernhardt becomes an aggressive Sarah these
days. She issued a £lO,OOO writ against N.Y. World for
gently suggesting that she’d see her “ autobiography ”
for the first time ’ when it appeared in print, and she’s
just had a Parisian editor mulct of £2O damages, fined
£2, and gaoled for a week. The question was whether
or not Sarah should join the Legion of Honor, and the
editor thought not. He also gave reasons. It was the
reasons that made Sarah wild.
There is one leading lady in a prominent Australian
combination, the quality of whose acting can always be
judged by the character of her dresses. If she likes her
part very much, she goes to great pains, and dresses it
charmingly ; if she dislikes it, any old clo’ will do. As a
result of this policy, shabby dressing and shabby acting
go together, and there is a marked gradation in gowns up
to the point at which the lady spreads herself like the
numerous Mrs. Solomon in all her millinery.
11 Silas Snell ”: The funniest item on Rickards’s Mel-
bourne programme these evenings is “ The Adventuress,”
a melodrama in four acts founded on “ Lady Audley’s
Secret,” and played by two or three imported specialists
and two or three raw recruits from among the song and
dance people of the ordinary vaudeville. The recruits are
rather superior to the principals, who were shipped half-
way round the world to present the excruciating shocker.
The Rickardian audience receives “The Adventuress”
with cold intolerance. It runs for about 20minutes, con-
sequently the acts are somewhat short and sudden. They
are more in the nature of involuntary spasms than
deliberate acts. In Act 1., occupying say five minutes,
Lady Audley is discovered canoodling with her elderly
baronet. The elderly baronet totters off and Lady
Audley’s former husband slides on. The lady says she is
going to faint, and asks the original husband to wet her
handkerchief in the well, said well being placed in the
centre of Audley Court lawn for the express purpose. The
superfluous husband deliberately climbs into the well to
moisten the wife, and Lady Audley pushes his head and
exits, exclaiming, “ Dead men tell no tales.” In Act 11.,
the bosom friend of the man in the well keeps talking of
the deceased, while Lady A. has facial convulsions, indica-
tive of unmitigated fury. “Happy ideal Kill the
bosom friend.” In Act 111., a young witness to the
murder in the well turns up and demands hush-beer-
monev. “ Happy idea ! Poison the young witness.” In
Act IV., Lady Audley has another happy idea; she
decides to set fire to the house and burn everybody. She
sets fire to the house, and is rejoicing over the incinera-
tion of the bosom friend, when the latter blows out the
fire and steps forth unsinged. The murdered man conies
out of the well. The elderly baronet drops dead. Lady
Audley begins to see snakes. She claws her features
violently, and screams to have the mad illusions removed
on a shovel, and then she conveniently dies. Nothing
funnier than “The Adventuress” has been seen on any
stage, but the gifted management insists on its being
taken seriously, and people whose screams of laughter
can be heard far away at Brunswick are thrown out.
“Cockaigne”: Mrs. Calvert, actress and manageress,
reminisces in the September Pall Mall. The familiar
account is given about Irving as a young man. Mrs. Cal-
vert could not see anything in him. Emily Soldene
thought him just a little beyond the ordinary—rather
clever. Miss Bateman says he gave her the idea of being
disappointed. This is borne out by two extant photos of
him, one in 1865 with the moustache, the other in 1868,
as Bob Gassitt in “ Dearer Than Life.” It was a dis-
appointed countenance.
“ D.” : With the arrival
in London of a brace of
mighty aliens from Mace-
donia—Arif Hassan (16Jst.)
and Mahmoud Ali (17fst.)
to wit—under the tutelage
of Perri, “The Terrible
Greek,” the wrestling mi-
crobe bids fair to nip the
Cold Country as shrewdly
as it did half-a-dozen years
agone. The spectacle of
one unwieldy foreigner, on
a small mat, essaying per-
spiringly for an hour on
end to roll another of the
same proportions over on
his back, and, after a mul-
titude of scientific smack-
ings, a d grippings, and
much thoughtful consider-
ation, failing, utterly in the
attempt, and instead being
himself upended and
smacked and gripped in his
turn by the other mon-
strosity, isn’t highly ab-
sorbing one would fancy,
unless to the expert. But
London, without in the
least understanding what it
all means, likes this sort of
show. As a show it is my-
sterious ; and it is rather
pointless, like a Lord
Mayor’s procession, or a
covey of beef-eaters emerg-
ing from the Tower, and
hence it is engrossing.
Hackenschmidt, the heavy
Russian substance, has been
challenged to lie on a mat
with both the new-comers
for vast sums of gold ; and
human abnormalities, with out-of-the-way and threaten-
ing names and boastful sub-titles, are becoming quite
frequent in the Great Mud.
“J.A.C.”: In these days, when the trend is towards
Protection, what’s the matter with protecting the mi-
gratory mummer ? He, and she, can do with it. True,
things are a little better than they used to be, and the
peripatetic pro. is not such a common object of the high-
way as in bygone days. Formerly, when an actor joined
a company formed for the purpose of raiding the back-
blocks, sympathising friends would anxiously inquire into
the condition of his boots and other items, the inference
being that the5 7 might be in requisition on the homeward
journey. But, alas, the harassed snide manager can no
longer imperiously march through the land, blazing his
trail with sounds of lamentation .from hotel landlords.
Under the present N.S.W. Licensing Act, Bung has power
to quod him. But while Bung is protected, the player is
neglected. There is no summary course open to him. He
cannot sue under the Masters and Servants Act ; he has
to go through the more com; heated processes of the
District Court. There are still sundry gentry travelling
the country whose return to town with all their liabilities
satisfied would be celebrated with a public holiday. Some
of their exploits are particularly heartless. Here is one
of many: I am acquainted with a young woman of
attractive appearance and unimpeachable respectability,
who joined a company formed by one of these marauders
—a scallywag who is Still pursuing the nefarious tenner of
his way. He began operations by borrowing a fiver—
“ just for a few days, you know—run myself short,” and
all that sort of thing. That was the last she saw of her
fiver. More than that, he planted her, as he, with great im-
partiality, also did the others, in an out-of-the-way country
township, with a threepenny piece and a return half railway
ticket in her pocket. She had to leave her baggage at
the hotel in pledge for her board, and she arrived in
Sydney with what she stood up in. She called on the
“ manager ” —he was living in a good hotel and apparently
healthy—and endeavoured to get a small sum from him.
Not abean ! What was she to do? Night was advanc-
ing-, she had no friends or relations in town to
go to no lodging-house keeper would take her in without
luggage, and she was in sore straits. Now, what should
be done to a person who could callously permit a decent
girl, to whom he was indebted, to run the risk of insult,
possibly worse ? I am at a loss to think of an ade-
quate punishment. Luckily, she met another member
of the company, who, not without difficulty,
learned how she was circumstanced, and, from his
own slender resources, helped her. They manage things
better in the Cold Country. There exists an Actors’
Protection Society, and, mainly through the instru-
mentality of the late Henry Irving, aided by John Hare,
Squire Bancroft, and Edward Terry, a special Act was
passed ordaining that any manager who takes out a com-
pany must show that he has in hand three weeks’ salaries
and return fares from the furthest point t.o be touched
during the tour. Infringement of this law doesn’t mean
a fine, it means a “ stretch.”
“ Melb.”: In view of the High Court decision re Sunday
shows, I have been looking them up. Wren’s Cyclorama
has the biggest crow-d —over 2000. Cole’s Hippodrome
has nearly 2000. Tom Mann, at the Bijou, has 1500. The
Democratic Club, familiarly known as the Demo, has up
to 800. This place is in Exhibition (formerly Stephen)
street, near the Hippodrome. The Masonic Hall has
about 800. The Guild Hall, formerly the Zion and
Hibernian, is also open on Sunday nights—a very large
place, which Tom Mann has left for the Bijou. Wirth’s
new Olympia, south of Prince’s Bridge, next Prince’s
Court, is being readied up for Sunday nights, and will
hold 4000.
Phil Goatcher, of decorative stage memory, has estab-
lished himself in Melbourne and Perth simultaneously
as a decorator and general oracle to house-furnishers. A
promising son shares his labors in the upholstery vine-
yard.
“ J.K.” : The “draw” of Paris during most of last
season was “ Thais,” an opera founded on the novel of
that name. A disrobing scene, that is described as
altogether paralysing (and also as incapable of being
bqwdlerised), makes the new production unfit for English-
speaking peoples to patronise in their own pure lands.
The dogged purity of the British person (in his own
country) loses him more artistic shows than enough.
A Philistine ”: In spite of much enthusiastic news-
paper praise and huge advertisement, Clara Butt, as an
artist, has missed fire in Melbourne. Her audiences are
never moved to the spontaneous admiration that Trebelli
or Orossley, or even Arral, elicited. They are merely
astounded by the thundering big voice and impressed by
the thundering big owner of the thundering big voice.
They applaud Clara, and the sweetly handsome father of
Clara’s much-advertised kids, as a matter of course ; and
demand encores, with the idea of getting more than
they’re offered for the large price of admittance to see
the large woman. But Clara doesn’t touch them on a
vital spot. She is too obviously coached. Her gusts of
passion, her gentle pathos, her subtleties, and her senti-
mentality bespeak a master-mind and an inspired soul.
But one feels all the while that neither mind nor soul
belongs to Clara—that she’s only a voice which sings bor-
rowed interpretations in carefully learned phrases. Of
course, when her maternal gifts and their much-boomed
exercise are considered, one can forgive Clara for being
a very ordinary woman for her size and her voice—or
one should. Butt at a guinea a time one wishes that some
of her loudly-heralded charm would slop out of her
nursery hours into her concert performances. Clara’s
husband is most superior—awfully well-bred and feahf’ly
goodlookin’—and he is almost as good a baritone as
Brownlow used to be. The other members of the concert
party are just nothing in particular. And the whole
blessed show is a nice example of the usefulness of a trio
of small children, and an ostentatious taste for home
comforts, when a plump giantess with a phenomenally
loud voice wants to catch public approval.
“P.” : “Go quietly ” is my advice to the
criminal, as well as to the drunk, when the bobby
happens along. James Holdsworth and James
Kelly, just convicted for the big tobacco robbery
at Kronheimer’s (Melbourne), will agree with me
when they come out ten years hence (less remis-
sion for good behavior) to read The Bulletin
back files. The night they were arrested they
fought like the devil with bottles, bricks, feet and
fists, while another nqan, who used a gun, got
away with a bullet somewhere inside him. The
upshot was the maximum sentence of ten years.
Their record might have got them the maximum
anyhow, but the bottles and bullets made it a
sure thing that Justice A’Beckett would give them
all he knew. Always go quietly—or else run like
an Early Christian pursued by Beelzebub.
The British bluejacket is not exactly the
man in whom one would expect to find romance
and all-conquering passion; such things are
hardly to be expected at the salary he gets. But
the trial of Joseph Robertson at Perth (W.A.) for
deserting the flagship Powerful, disclosed that he
and his mate, Leslie, were so much in love with
two Australian women that when the flagship was
five miles from the Westralian coast they lowered
themselves into the water and started the long
swim, in the hope of getting back to their girls.
Leslie was engaged to a Sydney girl, and
Robertson was married to a Melbourne one
(which last fact makes the case even more
bewildering). The water was bitterly cold ;
the currents were strong and adverse; and
Leander, no Leslie, becoming numbed, called for
assistance. Robertson swam through the dark-
ness towards his mate, but failed to find him,
and the presumption is that he was drowned.
Robertson struggled on, and after what seemed an
eternity reached the shore at North Fremantle,
where a man gave him some old clothes and asked
no questions. The plucky deserter had only 25.,
with which he kept himself alive four days, while
sleeping in the bush. Then he became hungry,
and the lonely nights were haunted by the last
cry of Leslie, and, unable to bear it any longer,
he walked to the nearest police-station and gave
himself up. Presumably desertion is a grievous
crime, but any decent court-martial (few such
courts are decent) would let Robertson down
easily. A man capable of tackling the contract
he attempted is rare enough to deserve considera-
tion. He is even more rare than the ilb. toy-
terrier and that unusual but ridiculous blue
postage-stamp of Mauritius that some addle-
headed people pay £4OO for.
There are many brands of whisky which
if taken at the flood lead on to snakes—although
not to Morrisey’s snakes. But D.C.L. is that
popular brand which assists the mental vision to
distinguish the real from the unreal, and guides
the feet of the wary from those tangled paths of
foolishness which end in wriggle. D.C.L. is the
anti-snake brand.*
“Caber”: Every week our household
worries through 10 loaves of bread, 181 b. meat,
41b. sugar, and other necessaries. Now I pay lOd.
extra for bread because the wheat crop in some
other countries has partially failed, and the ring
of rich Australian millers thinks 325. per ton
(with the mill offal thrown in) a fair dip into the
public’s trousers pocket; also I pay Is. 6d. extra
for meat on account of the dead-bullock market
being rigged by a ring of Homebush speculators ;
likewise I pay 4d. extra for sugar to help reward
the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. for successfully
creating a monopoly. This totals up 2s. Bd. Is
there any squealing about the workman’s penny
that Private Enterprise collars? Nary squeai.
But when the Commonwealth asks for a farthing
to protect its industries, the place gets quite
sloppy on account of the tears of the importers
and their papers.
From a veteran who has seen service in
three continents: —
The S. M. Herald, after deploring the poor condition
of the Australian defences, exclaims: “It would almost
seem that serving in the ranks was distasteful to the Aus-
tralian.” Here, again, you get the idea that the Austra-
lian is something different from and inferior to the rest
of the world. As a matter of fact., he has the same feeling
about serving in the ranks as the average Englishman,
Frenchman, or German. In time of war he is as ready as
any other man to serve, but when the excitement of the
fighting is over, he finds life in barracks deadly dull, and
country quarters intolerable. That’s what’s the matter.
The idea of giving Australia a military force modelled on
the British Army must be given up, and some system
suited to the circumstances of the country must be con-
trived ; but, whatever it is, it must be based on the prin-
ciple of universal service. Australia cannot afford
exemptions. With universal service it would be possible
to put a quarter-of-a-million of men into the field at a
week’s notice.
The S. M. Herald the other day, without
mentioning the subject at all, managed to throw
a strong sidelight on the Sydney attitude towards
the Federal capital question. It was discussing
far-Western railway projects, and mentioned that
a deputation had asked for a railway from the
Darling at Menindieto Broken Hill. Whereupon
the Herald laid this down :
The only gratification this State could derive from the
expenditure of whatever sum the line would cost would
be the increase of the earnings of the railways of South
Australia. That is a proposition which could not be ex-
pected to appeal to the persons responsible to the country
for the development of its resources by means of im-
proved railway communication.
The Lower Darling country might benefit, and
Broken Hill might benefit, and the country
between might benefit, and the railway itself
might pay handsomely; but because the S. Aus-
tralian railways might also benefit —in other
words, because the traffic would naturally flow
through S. Australia instead of unnaturally to
Sydney—the thing isn’t to bethought of, just as
any proposal which doesn’t allow of Sydney get-
ting all the trade of the Federal capital isn’t to be
thought of either.

Geo. Anderson, aged 70, who was recently
handed six richly-earned years of hard labor by
Vic. Justice A’Beckett for having made two
attempts to criminally assault a girl, cetat 13,
is probably a lunatic or the next best thing
thereto. However, quite as comprehensive a
lunatic in her way appears, on her own showing,
to be the child’s mother. According to the
evidence, Anderson, a perfect stranger, came to
the lady, and, with her full consent, took her
child [cetat 13) away to the Palace Hotel, Bourke-
street, “to teach her to be an actress.” The same
lady, if asked for 3d. or the loan of the frying-pan
by one whom she did not know, would probably
have bristled with ire and refused absolutely so
preposterous a demand. And yet a 13-year-old
girl is just as valuable as a frying-pan, and is
almost invariably worth more than 3d.
PRISON HUMOR.
PRISONER (to warder operating at camera): “ When can I see the proofs?”
“Diogenes,” from Murwillumbah :—
Re your remarks about Murwillumbah (N.S.W.) fire
and municipal incapacity. The same council, some little
time ago, in full conclave and after solemnly discussing
the matter for three-fourths of an hour, decided by vote
that an old brolly, which had been lying in the street for
a week, should be removed by the Inspector of Nuisances.
Perhaps it was the necessity for struggling with such
vital matters as the brolly in the street that delayed the
city fathers from coming to some decision on the trifling
matter of a water supply, although the water question
had been before them for the last three years.
Leon Nelken, “honorary supervisor” of
the recent gigantic Sydney Town Hall meeting of
protest against the tariff (the meeting of protest
that would have constituted a perfectly terrific
protest had anyone turned up to protest), gathered
on Tuesday night last week, together with another
convinced anti-tariffist, at Bateman’s Hotel. His
object was to explain to a great crowd of citizens
why no one protested against the tariff on that
memorable night; also to submit a balance-sheet
in connection with the struggle. Leon is probably
the worst hand at alluring a crowd in this hemi-
sphere. Of all the anti-tariff subscribers to the still-
born movement of the 16th, not one turned up on
Tuesday to wring Nelken’s hand, and sympathise
with him in his trouble. Thirty-three bright
golden sovereigns has Leon expended (also four
bob and eke a tlirippenny bit), and he wanted to
tell the multitude that fizzled all about the details.
A telegram to Senator Gould ran into 11s.
6d. (so a S.M.H. reporter learned); postage
stamps worked out at a solid 2s. ; the sending of
the “ first circulars to 100 requisitionists ” stood
Nelken in no less than 7s. 3d. ; while on Sept. 9
the Freetrade enthusiast did in the sum of
Bs. on tram and cab fares. “Refreshments
to Senator Neild ” cost Is. on September 16.
“Someone,” says Leon, “was hostile to the
scheme,” and against that man the supervisor
proposes to “ take action.” Truly, it is all very
pathetic, and if J. Neild doesn’t pay back that
bob, with which he became refreshed on a false
basis, he ought to be ashamed of himself.

The trial of Abraham Myerson and Maurice
Myerson, the two Roumanian gentlemen who
have been defending themselves in battered
English, on a charge of defrauding a vast number
of Sydney traders, came to a curious end last
week. The accusation against the pair was that
they had bought huge quantities of goods on
credit, and then had auctioned them for cash at a
heavy loss, and concealed much of the proceeds.
The jury found Abraham, the terribly voluble
man of the pair, guilty straight out; and it is re-
ported to have found Maurice guilty with a most
remarkable recommendation to mercy because of
ill-health, and because he was the “ unsuspecting
tool ”of Abraham the Voluble. Logically enough,
George Reid, K.C., demanded that this should be
regarded as an acquittal in the case of Maurice ;
a man can’t be guilty of fraud if he had no
fraudulent intent, and was only somebody else’s
“unsuspecting tool.” Then it turned out that
his Honor hadn’t heard the really important part
of the alleged recommendation, and hadn’t it
down in his notes. His associate hadn’t taken it
down at all. Crown Prosecutor Pollock had
apparently missed the word “unsuspecting,”
which made all the difference. The man from
the Crown Solicitor’s office had done the same as
Pollock. The jury had dispersed, and couldn’t
be recaptured. So in the end Abraham the
Deafening got five years, and his brother, the man
who, according to at least one press report, was
found guilty and completely exonerated at the
same time, got 2| years. Naturally, he wore a
dissatisfied expression when his little lot was
handed down to him. Any man would under
these mixed conditions.
‘ 4 Moony Mike ” sends a letter which
awakens The Bulletin to the fact that it is
tottering on the verge of a controversy of which it
is impossible to see the end :—
“ Wakeful’s ” surprise (B. 19/9/’07) has apparently got
the better of the good quality of observation which he so
modestly thrusts upon himself. Ballarat “ hasn’t got the
finest buildings, etc.” Bendigo has. The P.O. in Bendigo
is better than the Ballarat show in point of size, appear-
ance and appointment. Ballarat’s law courts become a
hovel beside Bendigo’s, which are said to have the finest
rooms and offices to be met with in any law courts in
Australia. Bendigo’s grandstand (brick), which seats
about 2000, was built eight years ago at a cost which
made the public howl. In an interview with a Daily
Mail reporter Jessop referred to it as a tin shed, and
when some indignant Bendigonian forwarded a photo to
the paper, Jessop looked up his diary and apologised—
he meant Ballarat, he said ! The Bendigo theatre
knocks spots off the Ballarat barn. Bendigo Town
Ilall is the best in Victoria outside Melbourne.
The residences of the upper class in Ballarat are better
than those of the Bendigo rich, because these latter are
too darned scared of spending their money. But the
other houses in Bendigo are much better, and are often
owned by the occupier. “ Wakeful’s ” other wails are
easily dealt with :—
On second thoughts, The Bulletin chops the
narrative off short just here.

The passengers rescued from the steamer
Fortunatus, burned in mid-ocean, have reached
Sydney, and tell of an amazing escape. The
Fortunatus was manned by a black crew, con-
sequently the boats were almost filled with
niggers. Luckily, on the third day after the
mishap, a ship was sighted, and it was none too
soon, for already a nigger mutiny, with almost
certain murder, was pretty plainly in sight. It
was so plainly in sight that an officer had pro-
mised a lady passenger that when the crisis came
he would shoot her, and thus save her from a
worse fate. The Fortunatus seems to have been
afflicted with the slackness and muddle which
characterise nigger ships. In the boats the water
supply was scanty ; some of the kegs were never
filled at all, and some of the water was
carried in open buckets and was soon made
undrinkable by salt spray. Some of the
corned beef was mouldy, while the tins supposed
to contain food turned out to be mostly pepper
and mustard. If only Bruce Smith and Merivale,
of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, had been
there they might have learned things about the
White Ocean policy. Far out on a trackless sea,
with a tin of mustard and a prospective nigger
mutiny, even a Tory’s belief in cheap colored
labor begins to totter somewhat.

An importer’s clerk writes this without
the knowledge of the boss
The antiquated and inadequate methods of discharging
and unloading imported goods at the Sydney wharves—
methods which were in use when goods used to arrive in
an occasional wind-jammer—are still used now when
steamers are arriving nearly every day, and are capable
of vomiting 6000 tons of carg'o in 48 hours. The result
is that the shippers (who only give consignees 48 hours
grace) dump their cargoes higgledy-piggledy on the
wharves and as far as they dare up the neighboring
streets. No attempt is made at classification. Conse-
quently if six cases of hats come consigned to one firm, a
case will be at the bottom of one heap and a couple more
at the top of another, while 1000 rolls of Carruthers’
wire-netting are probably reposing on the remainder. An
unfortunate carter starts at 9 a.m. to get these hats.
An hour is wasted dodging all the carts in the
city which are also down after goods. On reaching the
wharf the rest of the day is spent looking for the hats,
and at 6 p.m. the carter returns to his boss with about
half the consignment. Up to now the shipowners, steve-
dores, merchants, and master carriers have just made the
carter work overtime without payment until he found
the blessed hats. The Arbitration Court award has,
however, fixed the hours for the carters, and the men
are beginning to make good money in overtime.
The master carriers have now notified the merchants that
this overtime charge is to be debited to them. The mer-
chants are threatening to charge it up to the stevedores,
while the stevedores warn the shipping people that the
bill will come to them. The whole shipping community,
which didn’t bother while the poor carter had to stand
the racket, is now going to combine and see whether the
whole business can’t be put on a modern basis. It even
threatens to copy Melbourne.
Judge Gordon has got in an ugly blow at
Costs in S. A. In a small Supreme Court case
lately he told the Bar that he “ intended to dis-
courage long and tedious investigation by counsel
of cases in the law books,” adding that the Court
might be “presumed to have some knowledge”
of leading cases. (Most Judges insist on being
presumed to know nothing, and must have every-
thing thrown at them.) Gordon added pleasantly
that counsel “could of course read from their
books at any length they liked ”; but in
small cases he should allow only one day’s Costs,
no matter how ' long the arguments were
spun out! The senior counsel present pulled
himself together, and remarked manfully
that he was “glad to hear your Honor say this,”
and the case ended that afternoon. All the same
it is a little rough on the firm of Horsetail and
Costs. To-day it meets the Judge who admits
that he knows the leading cases, and is willing to
take them into consideration without having them
all explained to him. To-morrow it runs against
the Bench that refuses to be officially aware that
King William-street is a public thoroughfare
unless the matter is explained, and if Horsetail
and Costs forget to mention the fact they are
liable to lose their case through his Honor’s mis-
taken impression that King W.-street is a grass
paddock.

The Bourke Meat Co.’s works, which cost
about £25,000, are to be dismantled and sold,
owing, as S. M. Herald puts it, “ to the desire
to concentrate this class of business around the
metropolis.” Thus, in order to satisfy the insane
craving to drag all trade and industry to the over-
grown city, most of the £25,000 sunk in Bourke
will remain submerged ; and the deserted sites of
the meat works, tanneries, glue and bone mills,
where industries should be springing up to pro-
vide the local Bill with a job, will hum with
nothing but the industrious wandering goat, and
the empty jam-tin, and the children of Bill
demanding of the surrounding wilderness why
father stays at home now, and wherefore it is
mother no longer gives the family enough to eat.
And the S.M.H. contention that it may make
for cheapness to cart stock 500 miles, with much
suffering to themselves and considerable expense
and risk to their owners, won’t appeal to those
hungry children or to the wandering industrious
goat one atom.

Beer acts differently on different people.
An erring maiden was grabbed by the Melbourne
police on her way to the river. She had had two
glasses, and wanted to drown herself. Now, there
are girls in whom two glasses awaken only the
ambition to kick a man’s hat off the top of a lamp-
post. What’s the psychological difference ?
SURFING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T. B. Tartakover thinks that surf bathing will tempt
Sydney swimmers to leave racing practice, and so lower
their speed. —Newspaper allegation.
The say that Tartakover fears
The surf will stop the flyers,
The blokes with big high trudgeon gears
Whom everyone admires ;
They say he thinks that pace will go
And lazy we will be,
Splashing with Phyllida or Flo
Upon the frothy sea.
He says that when the billows bend
And fling you to the shore,
The strenuous life is at an end,
And racing is no more ;
That by-and-bye your sluggard limbs
Will more and more denote
A lazy crowd of Bills and Jims
Who only want to float.
Well, be it so. Let records fall,
While screaming papers scoff ;
Let champions with the latest crawl
Cut fifths of seconds off.
I will not kick with piston feet
To be the first man home,
While I can surf it with some sweet,
Brown Venus of the foam.

“Acacia”: Be your paragraph, “The
Girl With the Tale.” We have a maid named
May. She is the wrong side of thirty. She
prides herself on her morality and the dangers
she has escaped. Once she told us a tale of horror
that froze our blood. She worked with a woman
who ran a laundry and let lodgings to single men.
She had been washing all day, and in the evening
one of them inquired “Tired, May?” May
replied that she was tired, whereupon the base
wretch said : “Well, don’t go to bed for half an
hour, and I’ll bring you something nice when I
come home.” “So I.got a tomahawk, and put it
under the cushion of a chair, and sat on it, and
waited for him to come in,” said maid May, with
the air of Mercia repulsing Marcus Superhumanus
with the Cross. Then the wretch brought her a
glass of milk and some sandwiches from the corner
shop for her supper. “ Did you not feel ashamed
of your unkind suspicions? ” inquired our Dorcas.
“ I did not,” said the virtuous girl with the nasty
mind. “He was only smoodging, but I wasn’t
afraid of him while I had the tomahawk ! ”
THE ALIEN.
“ Wonder what I’ve done to he sent here , and all
my chappies in the other place.”
Copper, though it has fallen from £lO5 to
£65 per ton, has had just a gentle little tumble
compared with the thing that has happened to
Costs in Victoria. In 1891 the County Court
cases tried ran up to 9947 in number, and there
were 247 civil cases for the Supreme Court to
wrestle with and thesehiorßar to feed upon ; last
year there were only 64 cases in the Supreme
Court and 556 in the County Court, or altogether
only about as many in the whole twelve months
as 1891 averaged every three weeks. No wonder
Six-and-Eightpence wears a worried look, and the
spider that haunts desolate places begins to spin
cobwebs across his doorway.

The latest kind of girl has turned up in
Melbourne. At the age of she became the
mother, in her own mind, of a wholly imaginary
child, and so harrowed up her own good name
that when a dead infant was found the police
reluctantly ran her in. Medical examination
cleared her character, much against her will, and
she was shunted into a Neglected Children’s
institution, calling out as she went “Gimme back
me sins,” or words to that effect.

Now that the drought has suddenly re-
sumed business in N.S.W. quite a lot of drifting,
temporary people, who couldn’t understand why
there should be a desire to plant
the Australian capital alongside
the ever-flowing Snowy River, will
begin to see the point. During
the last four good years it has
almost been forgotten that a modi-
fied drought is Australia’s normal
condition ; and that, if there is a
new city to be built, the first
essential is an unfailing river be-
side which to deposit that city.
The drought is only about three
months old, and already Sydney
is on short allowance of water. If
the dryness continues Sydney will
get on very short allowance ; the
Darling will shrivel; cows will
begin to walk across the Murray ;
the ’Bidgee will be little more than
a muddy trickle; the Lachlan will
be a mere unreliable dampness;
and Lake George will dry up.
But the Snowy, fed by the snow
and ice of N.S.W.’s one stupen-
dous mountain group, goes all the
time, and the capital that is planted
beside it will never be dry.
“Hiphen”: The atmosphere of Mel-
bourne is being much affected by the Melba
motor-car. It is a veritable prima donna among
motors. Everything about it surpasses all other
motors ever seen, heard of, or smelt. The screech
of its siren is louder than Bent’s coo-ee. It has as
many cylinders as a camel. Its speed is 10,000
candle-power. Its odor is the equal of 10 dead
whales, two wire-netting debates, and one Carru-
thers’ secesh speech. Inside it is an Aladdin’s
palace. It has hot and cold water laid on in every
bedroom, also Turkish, Russian, vapor and shower
baths. There are electric buttons for all require-
ments. For a brandy and soda all you do is to
press a knob, hold your face under the tap, and
there you are. If you take too much brandy and
soda you are fined ss. on the premises. There is
also the choice of beer, fizz and Hunyadi water.
Cold collation may be had in the car at any
moment of the night or day. For hot dinners,
however, 10 minutes’ notice must be given.
Three of Melba’s imported chefs have a galley
underneath, where they do the cooking. There is
a piano at which the owner can practise. On the
roof is a garden, where she can sit in the cool of
the evening. On this roof garden there is also a
patent groanagraph (specially invented), in which
the prima-donna can listen to her rivals singing
flat. The car contains a library, church, and
hair-dressing establishment, and long beaches for
surf-bathing. One side is a millinery warehouse,
and the other is a gymnasium and a space for
vigorous pedestrian exercise, also a yacht and a
balloon. A board the size of a farm states that
£5OO will be paid for any workable suggestion for
an improvement. It is the most magnificent, the
most lavish, the most ruinous—well, it is aboshter
and a blitherer. And trailing behind it are a pie
stall, a baked-potato can, and a peanut emporium,
and Melba’s own Dago (at £5OO a year) runs ahead
selling 24 bananas in a bag for 3d.

The matter excited more interest than it would
otherwise deserve, because plaintiff bad been
nominaWl for mpmhprqbin of a Masonic lodo-e
nominated for. membership or a iviasotne
and defendant was already a Mason. Being
asked about Jabara’s character, Brother Asaley
replied that he was a bad egg and {a bad hat, and
would cheerfully swear a man’s life away. Then,
pro and con., charges of arson, defrauding
creditors, making false declarations, and pro-
miscuous commercial rascality were passed
casually around. After the j ury had listened till
it was tired, it reckoned a verdict for plaintiff,
with each party to pay his own costs, would
about meet the case. His Honor told the jury it
had nothing to do with Costs, so it handed in a
verdict practically to the same effect, awarding a
farthing damages. From the evidence it looks as
though the order of Liberated Bricklayerssheltered
some queer fish. Asaley and another Jabara—
one Rasheed—and Mukand Lai all belong to the
one lodge, Mukand being Worshipful Boss, no
less ; and they stand in the order equal with

Last week the steamer Marere, a huge,
unwieldy, four-masted brute, was berthed at
Flood’s wharf, on the west side of Circular Quay,
Sydney, On backing out from the wharf the
steamer ran away, shot right across the water,
and was only stopped by a collier which was lying
alongside the French mail boat at the opposite
quay. The collier hasn’t felt really well since.
Luckily this was at a time “between” the ferry
boats. There are times when a large, clumsy
steamer doing the trick described above might
have walked over the ruins of two or three ferry
boats on its tempestuous way. The decision to
remove the oversea traffic from Circular Quay
cannot be arrived at too soon.

Tuberculozyne (Yonkerman).
64 Pitt-street, Sydney,
August 20th, 1907.
Mrs. C. Hargreaves,
Nelson, Maoriland.
Dear Madam, —Some little time ago we made you a
special concession in order that you might continue the
Tuberculozyne treatment without intermission until your
health is quite restored. You surely would not delay in
sending for your treatment without good reason, so we
write to-day to learn why we have not heard from you.
We cannot see how it would be possible to send more con-
vincing proof that Tuberculozyne does cure Consumption,
if taken in time, than we have sent you ; and we have
told you that we fear you are running a great risk in
discontinuing the treatment now, when you have already
laid a good foundation on which to build. When con-
sumption is once fully established, it requires heroic and
persistent treatment" to overcome its ravages, and it is
because we so fully appreciate the deadly nature of this
disease that we persist in warning you over and over
again.,..
We have sent you our booklets filled with the joyful
words of many who write that they have been rescued
from sickness and suffering by the Tuberculozyne treat-
ment, and we believe our remedy will ultimately prove
equally helpful to you. Do not give up hope, for you hav i
reason to feel assured that Tuberculozyne will cure you
as effectually as it did Henry March, or James Boylan, or
little Maggie Foster, and many others whom we might
mention did space permit.
You should delay no longer in sending for another
treatment of Tuberculozyne, for if you are not cured you
are running a fearful risk in allowing your disease to
progress unhindered when effective and regular treat-
ment for perhaps but a few weeks longer might restore
you to perfect health. To make life worth living, good
health is essential, and so long as there remains a trace
of the deadly consumption in your system you cannot be
well and hearty.
We shall hope to hear from you, and we trusv. you will
not permit a longer intermission between treatments, for
every day is of value, and we want to cure you with all
possible speed.
And the other letter
Nelson, Maoriland,
September 2, 1907.
Dear Bulletin.— Would you oblige me by telling the
agent for Yonkerman that Mrs. Hargreaves is dead ? It
is’no use me writing him and saying she is dead ;he will
persist in sending his letters. ...
I like the Lone Hand very much, especially its articles
“ For the Public Good.” Unfortunately, my late wife
would not see that she was being robbed by quacks.

“ It. A. P.” summarises the Holy Column: —
The S. M. Herald’s Religious Announcements columns
suggest that Sydney is cosmopolitan in its creed. The
Roman Catholic body seems satisfied to trust its members
to turn up without being reminded by advertisement.
Christianity other than the R.C. Church is sectioned as
follows by the S. M. Herald Church of England,
Presbyterian, Congregational, Methodist, Baptist (sub-
divided into “Strict” and “Particular”) and Church of
Christ. Included in “ Other Services, etc.,” are Unitarian
Church, Sydney Christadelphian Ecclesia (whatever that
means), Sydney Progressive Spiritualistic Lyceum, Church
of Seers "(where an infant, with the assistance of the
members, will be dedicated to Spiritualism by Mr. Blank),
Mr. Blank’s Domain Church (where the preacher preaches
from Ecclesiastes Chap, ix., v. 13-17), Christian Science
Church, New Church, Philosophical Society, Social Demo-
cratic Federation, Spiritualists’ Association of N.S.W.,
Sydney Theosophical Society, Sydney Women’s Prayer
Union, L.O. Lodge Annual Religious Service, Y.M.C.A.,
Y.W.C.A., the United Welsh Free Church, and, lastly, the
Universal Brotherhood Organisation and Theosophical
Societv. The last, I believe, is quite a small body
despite its name. Many of the preachers publish their
text or subjects, which include such items as “Man
Overboard,” “ Unappreciated Service,” “Preaching to a
Small Audience,” “ The Glory of the Commonplace,” and
“The Queen of Sheba.” “A Spirit Flower Service” is
advertised ; Seven Seances are to be held, and, to con-
clude, this variegated column announces an organ (not
barrel) for sale, and calls for “ two earnest young men ”
as Catechists or Stipendiary Readers.

COLUMN
There are several good points and a few poor
ones about Treasurer Kidston’s past management of the
Queensland finances and his proposals for the future. He
only goes off the right track when he plays the politician
and juggles with words and figures in relation to loans
and loan expenditure. He recognises that borrowing is
in general bad, and in Queensland’s already over-weighted
condition very bad ; and he takes credit for not borrow-
ing. Yet, while he doesn’t borrow, he uses borrowed
money. “Never before,” he said in his Budget speech,
“ did Queensland refrain from borrowing for four years,
and never before was Queensland in so strong a financial
position ” ; also:—
“ The burden of our annual interest bill was already so
heavy in comparison with our revenue that it was deemed
desirable to call a halt; and the Government decided to
attempt to finance Queensland without further borrow-
ing, for some years at least. I am glad to say that,
despite all predictions of failure, this policy has been
carried out with marked success.”
That sounds well: but, according to the showing of the
Treasury itself, the loan expenditure for the past four,
years has been as follows :
Loans
Works, to Local
etc. Bodies. Total.
1903- .. £508,082 £95,723 £603,805
1904- .. 171,224 54,242 225,466
1905- .. 193,388 104,236 297,624
1906- .. 614,557 69,013 683,570
Total £1,487,251 £323,214 £1,810,465
Yet, in spite of this loan expenditure of £1,810,465 in
four years, it is true in one sense that there has been no
borrowing. The fact is that, just previously, there had been
heavy borrowing, and Treasurer Kidston ha 3 been living
on the proceeds of those transactions. At September 30,
1903, the Q.N. Bank held £1,699,945 of borrowed money
locked up under the bank’s reconstruction scheme. In
four years the Bank has repaid £405,373 of this locked-up
money, and now owes only £1,285,572. That accounts
for nearly half a million. Then for many years Queens-
land had lent large sums to local authorities—for the con-
struction of railways, sugar mills, etc. In something
under four years £523,831 of this money has also been re-
paid. It is easy enough, then, to understand why
Treasurer Kidston hasn’t borrowed any money. Previous
Governments borrowed money and lent it to a third
party, and the third party has been paying it back. But
instead of Treasurer Kidston paying off his loans, and thus
ending the whole transaction, he has torn up the third
party’s lOU and used the money himself. Under those
circumstances, to say that the Government and the State
have left off borrowing is mere juggling with words.
The other unsatisfactory feature of the Kidston
financial policy—half-brother to the first feature—is the
manner in which the surplus is handled. After a suc-
cession of appalling deficits, amounting in four years to
£1,163,893, Kidston arrived, and with him the following
surpluses:—
1904- .. .. £13,995
1905- .. .. 127,810
1906- .. .. 396,115
Under the Queensland law surpluses go in reduction of
accumulated deficits; though a part of the surplus
of 1905-6 was devoted to paying salaries previously cut
down. The whole of the past year’s £396,115 is, how-
ever, available towards wiping out the old blot. But
Treasurer Kidston puts it this way :
“ This surplus was paid over to the trustees of the
Public Debt Reduction Fund on July 17, and was in-
vested by them in the purchase of a debenture which has
since been cancelled, thus increasing by nearly £hoo,ooo
the fund available for public works without any addition
to the public debt of the State.”
In other words, Treasurer Kidston wipes out a blot for
the miserably poor purpose of having paper on which to
make another blot of the same size. He doesn’t wipe
out a debt so that the burden of interest may be reduced
forever; he only sees in the circumstance a deplorable
excuse to borrow the old amount over again, and increase
the interest burdan up to the old breaking point or there-
abouts.
For the rest the Kidston policy is nearly as good
as it could be ; it is amazing, in fact, that a Treasurer
who does the honest, straightforward things that Kidston
does or proposes to do should juggle with the loan
business as he does. Carruthers, of N. S. Wales, pro-
duced surpluses by a system of cunning fakes—first, by
calling a million of land sales money revenue ; then by
deferring a vast amount of the expenditure, and
ultimately paying it out of a public works fund,
provided very, largely out of the so-called surplus.
Kidston refuses to get into the limelight by any
such shallow trickery with figures. This year he
estimates that he will have a surplus of £7104. A
Treasurer built on the Carruthers model might have esti-
mated a surplus of that size ; but he would have made
pretty sure of actually having one of £500,000. Kidston,
however, instead of producing a fake surplus, and paying
for things out of it, provides for the payment of things
direct. The result is that, as he provides for spending
out of revenue £528,503 more than last year’s total, his
chances of producing a huge surplus at' the end of the
year, and standing in the limelight while he poses as a
Heaven-sent financier on the strength of it, are pretty
small But that won’t affect the real quality of his finance.
Treasurer Kidston’s extra expenditure of
£528,503 includes £448,648 which he sets down as “ extra-
ordinary.” This total includes £60,000 for old-age
pensions—six months’ payments only, because it is prac-
tically impossible to get the proposed system to work
until the beginning of next year. As pointed out just
now, for several years previous to the arrival of this run
of good seasons, Queensland had a deficit, which
amounted for the one year 1900-1 to £528,189. Prac-
tically no new taxation has been imposed since then ; on
the contrary, some taxes have been reduced, and
Treasurer Kidston also proposes to cut £lOO,OOO off rail-
way freights and fares. In view of all those things, it seems
dangerous to put a new permanent charge of £lOO,OOO
upon the revenue without making special provision’ for
raising the money. Apart from that, the vast bulk of
Kidston’s extra expenditure will be paid once and then
done with. He puts £78,000 into public buildings, spends
£50,000 on immigration, £28,500 on relaying certain rail-
ways, and pays £125,148 into loan account to recoup it
for certain items which should never have been charged
to loans —loss on loan flotations, cost of temporary
buildings, and aids to deep sinking. To wipe out these
items is good, honest finance. The one cockroach in the
soup is represented by the Treasurer’s bad habit of
apparently regarding the wiping out of that £125,000 as
a justification for spending another £125,000 of borrowed
money on works—the bad habit of regarding a blot
removed as merely so much extra space available for
putting in a new blot of the same dimensions.
A return as to the increase of State expenditure,
asked for by Mahon, M.P., showed that the six little local
Governments in 1905-’O6 spent £29,754,199, compared with
£25,469,084 in 1899-1900, allowing for £3,051,771 spent in
the latter year on Customs, Defence, etc., since taken
over by the Commonwealth. The worst offenders are,
naturally, those that have made the most noise about
“ Commonwealth extravagance ” and talked most loudly
about “ Secesh N. S. Wales, with an increased State
expenditure of £2,350,087, and Westralia, with a ditto of
£1,301,869. Not only have these thriftless prodigals
failed to reduce their expenditure as they were expected
to do, but they have enormously increased it.

The S. M. Herald tells again the absurd un-
truth that the sugar industry “ costs the people of the
Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds sterling
per annum to maintain,” and it wants to know' what is
going to happen in the future, when home production
will be passed, “ and every ton additional that is pro-
duced will prove an added burden to the people of the
Commonwealth.” The yarn that the “white” sugar in-
dustry is subsidised to the extent of “ hundreds of thou-
sands per annum ” has been told so often that thousands
believe it, even if the Herald knows better. Yet the
fact is that, so far from the sugar business costing Aus-
tralia a subsidy, Australia collects an excise duty from
the sugar producer of £3 per ton. If, however, the sugar
is “ white ” grown, a rebate equal to 4s. per ton of 10 per
cent, sugar-cane (= £2 per ton of sugar) is paid. In the
past five years things have panned out as follows ; and
the figures for the current year, according to official
estimate, are added to show that the present is much the
same as the past:—

Assuming that the estimates for 1907-8 are borne out
Australia will, therefore, in six years have collected from
the sugar-growers no less than £1,543,636 net. If the
growers of wheat, or wool, or butter had been called
upon to pay that much extra taxation, over and above
what other people pay, the Herald umuld have called it
robbery. But when it is the sugar industry that pays
this taxation, the Herald, maddened at the loss of its
kanaka, has the brazen effrontery to declare that the
industry “costs the people of the Commonwealth
hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum to main-
tain.”

The S. Australian railways had a phenomenally
good time last year (to June 30, 1907) —the fifth year in
succession in which an improvement was shown in the
matter of return on capital cost. In 1902 that return
was down to 2'98 per cent. ; for the past year it had got
up to 5-16 per cent., which meant a surplus of £227,643
after paying working expenses and interest. But there
is still an accumulated deficit of £1,450,817, plus wear
and tear and depreciation not provided for. Last year a
trifle more than usual was done in relaying permanent
ways and replacing condemned buildings and stock—
£l67,B2o went in such items—but there are still heavy
arrears. These figures do not include the Northern
Territory railway transactions.
The Northern Territory line earned a micro-
scropic amount over working expenses last year : the net
revenue was £738, which works out at o'o6 per cent, on
the £1,180,395 spent in construction. Pour years ago the
return got up to 0'32 per cent. ; but it has been gradually
shrinking since then. The balance-sheet now shows an
accumulated loss of £939,760 on the line ; so that, unless
something is done to make the railway of some use—at
present it runs 145 miles, and stops at nowhere in parti-
cular—it looks as though in about three years more the
accumulated loss will be equal to the first cost. The line
was opened in 1889.

This State Bank was established in 1896 primarily for the
assistance of agriculturists ; but it obtained power also
to advance money on town property, to municipalities,
and to encourage rural industries. The money has been
raised by the Treasury on bonds carrying 3J or 4 per cent.
The average amount of bonds outstanding last year was
£586,965 ; the interest paid was £20,763, so the average
cost was £3 10s. 9d. per cent. This money, along with
the bulk of the reserves, is let out at the uniform rate of
4| per cent. All that varies is the term of repayment,
and consequently the sinking fund. Interest and repay-
ment together work out like this :
42 years (the maximum).. .. £5 6 6 per cent.
20 years „ .. .. 712 8 „
10years ~ .. .. 12 10 8 „
The maximum term, so far as private loans are concerned,
is applied only to “ broad acres ”; on town advances,
where the security consists largely of buildings, the 20
and 10 year terms are usually imposed. But loans are
made for shorter periods at the option of the borrower,
though the bank’s experiences with regard to these short
loans, involving heavy repayments, are apparently not
very satisfactory. They account for the great bulk of
the arrears. And there is really no reason why people
should impose these short terms and heavy repayments
on themselves, inasmuch as the whole or any part of a
loan may be paid off at any time.
Arrears were mentioned just now. Of principal,
these amount to £11,601 ; of interest, only £998. From
the beginning, the total amount advanced has been
£1,109,362. The advances entirely paid off are £352,354,
leaving £757,008 advanced on mortgages current. The
total amount which should have accrued for reduction of
principal is £184,002; the amount paid is £172,401,
leaving the £11,601 of arrears mentioned ; so that of the
amounts which have fallen due £2 4s. per £lOOO are in
arrear. There have, of course, been some few fore-
closures during the 12 years ; but the total losses on this
account have been only £586. As against that, there are
the aggregate net profits of £25,582, now shown in the
table above as reserves.
These substantial profits, now available to meet
future reverses, have been made in spite of the fact that
there is a margin of just less than 1 per cent, between
the borrowing and the lending rate. That, however, as
this next list shows, has been ample so far

These expenses include “ contingencies,” but not addi-
tions to buildings, etc., charged to profit and loss ; the
latter item is, however, small. The contingencies in-
clude travelling expenses, rates, etc. The amazing thing
at first sight is that, considering the terms the bank
offers, the advances should not be larger in the aggregate.
The fact, however, is that this bank’s competitors have
come down to its level or thereabouts. Things in that
respect are not what they were. This writer had his
first experience of money-lending’ in S. Australia, a few
years before the State Bank opened its doors. On some
“ broad acres,” otherwise unencumbered, he paid at one
time 8 per cent. ; as the State Bank drew nearer, he paid
down to 6J per cent. At the State Bank £7 12s. Bd. per
cent, pays not only interest, but repays principal also in
20 years. This Bank’s balance-sheets and accounts don’t
show all the good it has done. The most highly respect-
able private shark’s 8 per cent, made a beast of burden of
this writer for three or four of what ought to have been
the best years of his life. There is no need for the young
man of to-day to become a beast of burden under similar
circumstances.
As mentioned previously, the money is raised
by bonds. As advances are paid off old bonds have also
to be paid off : and this process has recently gone on as
follows:

It will be observed that the advances are £613,731, or
£21,131 more than the bonds outstanding ; and that ex-
plains where the reserves are.

This co. is loaded up with properties bought at old boom
prices. They seem to include some pretty poor properties,
too, as well as dear ones ; the co. complains of large
warehouses being- unoccupied, and other misadventures
ol the same kind. The rents gross are equal to £3 18s.
per cent. ; and the co. owes £126,654, on which the
interest averages a shade under 4J per cent. That and
the working expenses, including large amounts spent on
repairs, explain why the co. only shows a microscopic
profit even though the rents do give nearly 4 per cent,
gross on book value. There is a theory that only an allow-
ance too small to be worth mentioning need be made for
depreciation in connection with solid city buildings ; but
experience shows that the man or the co. that starts out
on that assumption is likely to get into trouble.
The man who pays rent wants conveniences for
his money, and the old premises soon can’t offer
the conveniences of the new ones, which means either
large numbers of “ To let ” signs in the old buildings or
heavy outlay in renovations and remodelling. Evidently
this co. suffers in this way ; while it has nursed its boom-
bought properties, other people have put up new
premises, and so its outlook has become steadily gloomier.
The capital stands nominally at£160,648; itisimpossible to
tell from the published figures how much is approximately
intact. The rents are not much help, because unoccupied
land, which may be worth thousands, may be bringing in
only pence. Beyond that, it is hard to find anything
cheerful to even vaguely suggest. Of 20,000 shares 4393
have been forfeited—37l during the past year—and there
is a good deal of eloquence about those figures on the
question of what capital is intact.

Ten years ago the capital was £42,890 ; but it was written
down in two lots—one in 1897, and one in 1904—and it
now stands at £17,056. The profits on property sales
shown during the past two years are, therefore, only
book profits ; to the extent of those profits, things haven’t
panned out quite as badly as was provided for when the
properties were written down out of capital. Having had
this cleaning-up—and it looks thorough enough—the
society now prepares to go into regular business again •
since 1891, when it left off dividends, it has practically been
getting out of the bog, and doing nothing else. At present
deposits and other debts amount to only £2858 (10 years
ago they amounted to £23,542, and that was more bog
to get out of); and the total income for 1906-7 was
only £1735. In spite of its name, the society, with
the paraphernalia of an office to maintain, can’t show
good results on a business that size. Of the assets
(£24,518) only £6410 are advances ; the balance (except a
small furniture item) consists of foreclosures. These
latter have, however, been written down so hard that
they returned last year about £7 2s. 3d. per cent. In
view of the way in which the society has cleaned up the
old wreckage, the proposal to go into ordinary business
again deserves encouragement. But on the present
capital it can only be a small business, after all—pre-
suming the society keeps the borrowing within the
bounds that it ought to keep.

The amount of the bonus mentioned in the last line is
approximate. To help the local market this co. exports
butter, and, in consideration of that fact, suppliers
whose butter is sold locally have Jd. per lb. deducted to
form an export fund, to safeguard the co. against losses
on shipments. For the season ending July, 1906, there
was a loss of about £7B ; for the past season the results
were more satisfactory, and all the farthings deducted
will be paid back : this amount is included in the bonus.
Before making the half-yearly payments on account of'
dividend, bonus, etc., the reserves consisted of insurance
fund £5OO, dividend equalisation fund £lOO, export re-
serve £362, and undivided profit £509. The co., which
runs its own little river steamers to collect cream, and
made 420 tons of butter in the past 12 months, started
out on its useful co-operative career in 1901; up to that
time the factory had been owned by the Australian Dairy
Co. Depreciation appears to be amply provided for, and
the management seems to be marked by economy.

This is a complicated business. Instead of being content
to put aside something by way of reserves, and thus
making' the fat years provide against probable losses
during the lean years, this concern has capitalised almost
all of the profits left over after paying 6 per cent, and
providing the usual cash bonus. In the past six years the
total amount capitalised in this way is £2710, which is
considerably more than half the capital. That means
that the 6 per cent, dividend is going to be something
more than a 12 per cent, dividend in reality—that is to
cay, on the capital actually paid up. The defence of this
policy is that this is a co-operative concern, and there is
an ancient delusion that co-operative concerns have no
right to have reserves—Heaven only knows why.
Naturally the policy is leading to trouble already.
-Because the dividend amounts to just about double what
it ought to—-it has bean gradually creeping up to that —
the association finds it inadvisable to pay any bonuses at
all in cash ; but instead of putting the amount to reserve,
the whole lot is capitalised, so that next year the
trouble will be still worse. The 6 per cent, dividend next
year (if it can be paid) will be equal to about 14 per cent,
on the capital actually put up ; and yet the chairman had
tne gall to tell shareholders at the half-yearly meeting,
apropos of something else—“ This is carrying out the true
co-operative principle of distributing the profits on the
basis of purchases, and not in large dividends on the
capita] one may have invested in shares.” Taking it all
round, it appears to be the most unsatisfactory co-opera-
tive concern in the Commonwealth. Tasmania did have
two others, run on equally wrong lines, but they both
appear to have dropped out; and this one is going the
right way to disappear also. Some of the figures in the
last line are approximate ; the amounts of the dividends,
bonuses, etc., have to be partly estimated. Also, by the
way, £lO has fallen into the reserves without mentioning
where it came from.

The form of this society’s accounts might be simplified to
advantage ; but the policy with regard to finances is un-
mistakably good. In addition to steadily writing down
the capital items, 5 per cent, of the net profits go to re-
serve as a fixed thing, and as much thereafter as possible :
in other words, additions to reserves are not regarded as
something that can wait till dividends are satisfied.
Bonuses (2| per cent.) are distributed among non-share-
holding purchases ; and this total and the half-yearly
contribution to the distressed members’ fund are in the
foregoing deducted from profits. Also the society has for
its motto, “ Australian Goods for Australian Citizens,”
and does a valuable patriotic work apart from actual
shop-keeping.

That interesting little experiment promoted
among Victorian civil servants, the Co-operative Credit
Bank of Victoria, is getting big enough to be noticed now
with the naked eye. At the end of its first half-year
(August, 1906) it had a paid capital of £425, and £404 had
been advanced. (The advances are for all sorts of things,
but mostly to allow the borrower to purchase for cash at
the Civil Service Stores. The “ bank ” does a good deal,
too, in this line : shareholders who usually take out
monthly railway tickets are financed so that they may
take out “ half-yearlies.”) Present paid capital is £1674,
out of £2OOO authorised ; and the authorised capital is
now to be put up to £5OOO. Last half-year’s profit was
£42, and the co. starts off on a dividend career with
6 per cent.

North Queensland Insurance and North Queens-
land Accident Insurance Cos. have about completed
arrangements for amalgamation. The new co., to be
called the Queensland insurance Co., will have a capital
of £150,000, half paid up. The combined capital of the
two cos. was £134,375 (£67,187 paid) ; the extra amount
has been made up by the issue of new shares (one for
every seven) to holders in the North Queensland Insu-
rance Co.

Apropos the moan of the London bosses of the
Westralian mines (which pay £2,000,000 a year in divi-
dends, mostly to people in England and other
foreign parts) that the tariff will cost them
£50,000 in duties on mining machinery: A N. S.
Wales co. lately wanted an air compressor. It
got three or four prices—among them one from an
English maker, and one each from Queensland and
Victorian makers. The English tender was £1375, and the
co. wanted four months in which to deliver the machine.
The Queensland maker offered a machine of the same
capacity, built according to the co.’s specifications, and
subject to the co.’s tests, for £765; also these works under-
took to deliver in seven weeks. The Victorian tender-was
£7Bs—Queensland, £765 ; Victorian, £785; English, £1375.
Both the Queensland and the Victorian works were
established under the High Protection of the State
Governments; and, having become established, this it the
result. Instead of costing it money, High Protection on
this one line puts £6lO into the co.’s pocket, and provides
it with the plant in half the time that the foreign maker
required. Some of the mining cos. which don’t complain
about other machinery say, nevertheless, that electrical
machinery can’t be made here and should be free. Well,
air-compressing machinery wasn’t made here either until
Queensland and Victoria encouraged its manufacture
with High Protection.

Block 14, Broken Hill, is holding a better hand
than it has done for years. Over 10,000 tons of carbonates
have been won this last half-year ; and there are another
10,000 tons in sight. But the limit to the carbonate pro-
duction is also in sight ; and, in spite of recent develop-
ments and a rosy balance-sheet, people will ask that
annoying question, “What is there below the 600 ft.
level”? It is all very well to hold up the northern end
of the mine as a kind of promised land, flowing with high-
grade ore ; but the mine has been so full of disappoint-
ments that proof positive is called for. All that is certain
is that the new find will add something to the rapidly
shrinking sulphide reserves. Meantime, it is fortunate
for the management that a little good ore was come
across south of the shaft at the 400 ft. level, on the sill
floor, where previously only poor material was thought
to exist. This development has “sweetened” the ore
milled, which had been falling to a very low grade.
* * * ■«
Just now the Junction North, Broken Hill, is
plugging through a tiresome rhodonite bar at the northern
end of the 937 ft. level, and the miners don’t like the job,
and “ pull out ” as fast almost as they go in. There is
about 13ft. of this atrociously hard stuff to get through.
Especially now, when miners’ wages are ruling high on
the Barrier, the occurrence of rhodonite means distress
for the underground manager. Parties are allowed some-
thing extra per ton to throw it out, so that it won’t get into
the mill and cause a loss of lead (owing to its high specific
gravity rhodonite usually carries away from the tables
a portion of the lead derived from other sources). Even
then, lumps of it get to the ore breakers, and cause
trouble there. The Junction North doesn’t believe in
giving contract miners what the management considers
exorbitant wages ; heuce the recent interruption in the
output. The mill has been running very well lately, but
frequent stoppages, owing to lack of ore, have curtailed
the production.
* * * *
Much has been said concerning the lack of
■“competent” miners at Broken Hill, especially shaft-
men and men for sinking winzes ; but very little has
been said about the unusual rush of shaft-sinking along
the line of lode. Good shaft-men—men capable of
putting timber in a shaft—are never plentiful, and just
now there are more of them employed on the Barrier
than for the last 17 years. Shaft-sinking is in progress
at the B. H. Prop., Block 10, South, Block 14, British,
North, Junction, South Blocks, New A.B.H. Consols, and
New White Leads, so it is no wonder men qualified for
that class of work are scarce. But it i 3 not the sort of job
that lasts long as a rule.

British Broken Hill is looking hopefully
towards that block of almost virgin ground
between Thompson and Marsh shafts, known as Block 16.
The main outcrop takes a sweep to the northward just as
it passes Thompson shaft, but there is plenty of evidence
of the existence of an eastern make of ore, which probablv
occurs in a succession of shoots pitching northwards, and
which must, therefore, be met, with in Block 16. Ore cut
in Thompson shaft a little while ago caused a mild sensa-
tion ; but, though it is following the shaft down in the
south end, it is, so for, too poo- to be seriously considered.

Some of the little floats that the Broken Hill
boom spawned in its early days can’t even wait for the
lead market to slide down before collapsing-. The North
British Blocks has now gone into liquidation. But the
very first to throw up the sponge was the Round Hill Co.
—a crowd that didn’t have half enough pluck to tackle
that proposition.

The Bellambi (N.S.W.) Coal Co. for the year to
August 31 shows net profits of £33,514. An interim
dividend of £13,125 was paid ; and there is now a distri-
bution of £17,500, making 17J per cent, for the year. The
co. has during die year wiped off the last of the deben-
tures issued in connection with the purchase of the South
Bulli, and after payment of the current dividend will have
reserves of £77,351.

Last monthly return from the Great Cobar is
nearly as bad a slump as the metal market is suffering
from : 16,400 tons ore for matte containing 356 tons
copper, lloOoz. gold, and 63000 z. silver. Previous
monthly runs have given 25 per cent, more copper. The
yield works out at 2.17 per cent, copper, I.4dwt. gold,
and 7idwt. silver. Allowing for loss in converting matte
and refining the metals, the yield would be Worth about
the same as Mt. Lyell ore averages ; but the profit would
be less, because of greater mining costs. A reduced yield
both in quantity and value is disconcerting. It is all
very well for the management to say that the output
will be doubled (it is now about 200,000 tons a year); but
if the value is to be decreased—well, who gains? Not
the shareholder, anyway.

Mt. David (N.S.W.) people wore a worried look
last week. The previous clean-up, which was expected
to go about 17dwt., climbed up to about 22dwt., and on
that and mine developments, shares, v/hich had had a bad
time at a few pence for years, ran up to 6s. 9d. The
second clean-up was expected to be as good ; but 400 tons
gave only 2790 z., including cyanide recovery. Promptly
thousands of shares were thrown at the market, which
was knocked in the day down to 4s. spi. The circum-
stances didn’t warrant the attack, and only Mt. David’s
long run of poor results and disappointments made
such a slump possible. The new reef has opened up better
than the mine’s record would have led one to expect.
Going up on the two rises above the level where the stone
was found the reef certainly narrows, but in the two
w.nzesit has gradually widened, and it is better to have
a reef widen as it goes down than as it goes up—it can’t
be reasonably expected to widen both ways. These new
workings have been badly ventilated—the air is none too
good even now—and, being short-handed through the
’flu’ raging in those parts, the manager didn’t rush stone
from these workings. Hence the crushing isn’t a test of
the quality of the new find—only about a sixth of it came
from there.

The old Frogmore copper mine (N.S.W. ), which
Francis Drake, representative of an English syndicate,
hoped to revive, has been given best, temporarily at any
rate. On the strength of the experience at Blayney, the
optionists had hopes of making something to go on with
out of the copper in the w'ater ; but, after the first few
feet, the results were very disappointing. In the natural
order of things it was expected that the copper in
solution would be at least no less, if not greater, as the
w'ater was lowered ; but this proved not to be the case.
The small quantity of copper in the water also casts some
doubt upon the size of the available ore deposits in the
mine.
* * * *
A spirit of resignation pervades the Board of
the New Brothers Home No. 1 (Tas.). There was a time
when to suggest that the lead might go into the Briseis
lease, despite Mackenzie’s survey, was to get hit on the
head with a brick. Now that the western rim rock has
risen like dough in a trough, what before could
only be whispered can now be proclaimed. About
500,000 cubic yards of drift is affected by the swing
of the lead. What life, then, has the mine when
shorn of this little slab ? Some say twelve months,
others eighteen, and a few sanguine souls venture
two years. Strike the average, and there is 9s. in divs.
ahead—provided, of course, the tin market keeps good.
Seemingly the Board was too obtuse to sniff out what the
potting of chairman Joske with a time sale of shares
months back meant. Now the veil is lifted, proving that
the market, as usual, smells the carcase soonest. J. B.
Mackenzie’s estimate of the contents of the mine was
1,448,000 cubic yards of drift, containing 1855 tons of
tin, from which, at £lOO per ton, he expected to net
£125,919. This is a little over £2 per share. To
date the co. has paid 11s., and the other 9s. above
referred to makes the total divs. 205., or half of the esti-
mate. The weak feature of his estimate was that he did
not bore or sink shafts ahead to prove actually the course
of the gutter. This mistake has been persisted in by the
Board, which thought all along it and not the Briseis had
the gutter. There is some talk of good tin on the high
ground, where a tributary may come in from the west.
But the fall is so great that the bulk of the tin has, in all
probability, been swept into the main gutter. However,
the lead now is to be bored, and the best and the worst
of the show will soon be known.

Pioneer Tin (Tas.) is to be reconstructed. Two
reasons—(1) to provide £27,000f0r apower station, so that
the plant can be worked electrically ; (2) to cut up shares.
The co. started some years back with 25,000 £1 shares, of
which 5000 went to the old Tasmanian co. Later on
2000 were let out at £4 10s. premium, and there are still
3000 in reserve. Price of scrip, £9; value of reserve
shares, £27,000. The co. wants £27,000 for its new
scheme. Why not sell these shares ? Not a bit of
it ! The idea is to make a new co. of £200,000
in £1 shares, issue 135,000 to holders of present
27,000 shares (five for one), and let £27,000 be subscribed
for 27,000 shares, holding the balance of scrip in reserve.
The reason for this roundabout is quite clear. £9 shares
are not very marketable, while 30s. or 40s. scrip will be.
The co.’s mine is the best alluvial tin show in
Tassy. The output so far has been 2,271,200 cub. yds. of
drift; tin, 219 j-( tons ; divs. paid, £lll,OOO. Costs are,
on an average, per cub. yard ; the dirt runs a shade
over 21b. of stream tin percub. yard. Last year’s divs. went
this way :—6s. 6d. in July, 6s. 6d. in Oct., Bs. 6d. in Dec.,
and 3s. 6d. in July. The co. has fully 2,500,000 cub. yds. of
drift proved ahead by boring, so that there is as much
dirt to work as has yet been sluiced. But work won’t be
as cheap, and the ground will be less rich. The lead is
widening, making the handling of more top drift necessary
to get at the richer dirt. That poorer drift is coming in
is shown by the yearly average returns, which have fallen
from fully 2£lb. to under 21b. If the price of tin fell, the
difference would be an item. So the idea is to bring out
the new issue, and give a chance to those who don’t want
risks to get out. At present the show is a fat-man’s
claim, Money Miller, Harvey Patterson, and Reggie Bright
being the stars.

Ringarooma (Tas.) dredge still lives in the
future. For nearly 18 months —ever since it started—it
has been going to cross to the east side of the river, and
hasn’t been able to ; so the time has been filled in on the
west side, bumping against submerged timber and making
losses, which at August 31 totalled £4072. Past half-
year’s contribution to this woe was £595. Calls have
now brought the capital up to £21,000, and that has put
the finances straight; there is somewhere about £6OO
clear on the credit side, which will tide the dredge over
the poor time it will have till it can cross the river—some
time probably in midsummer, if the weather is kinder to
the co. than it has been so far.
* * * *
There has been rather a better feeling towards
Mt. Molloy (Q.) lately: “ London ” has been sucking up a
few more shares.. The mine has bitterly disappointed
some men who inspected it, thought they couldn’t
make a mistake in valuing a mine, and bought in up past
405.; but it isn’t done yet, and is always liable to furnish
surprises. The ore occurs in bunches parallel to the bed-
ding of the banded shales, and under such conditions
parallel ore-shoots may be picked up at any time. The
ore found lately below the bottom level, though not rich,
will cost less for fluxes than the bulk of the ore. And
costs, anyhow, are not out of the way, considering the
circumstances. Raleigh, who has been put in charge
lately, is working economically—and, as a rule, there
isn't too much economy about N.Q. company-owned
mines.
Mt. Molloy (Q.) will get its railway ; and from
there John Moffat may next push the line on to the Mt.
Carbine wolfram show, especially if (as is likely) the O.K.
copper people come to some arrangement about extend-
ing it out their way. The Carbine is the wolfram show
which veteran Moffat introduced some time ago as the
biggest thing in wolfram in Australia. Practically all
the mineral got so far has been found at one end of a
small ridge rising out of a plain. The country rock con-
sists of shales and sandstones, and the wolfram occurs in
quartz reefs from 18in. to about sft. wide, nearly vertical
as a rule, and very patchy. A large quantity of wolfram
was got from the surface, but most of the work in the
future w'ill be reefing. With the mineral at over £7 per
bag the show supported about 300 men ; but things have
eased off now. The method of treatment looks ridicu-
lously crude, but it is pretty effective. The specimen
stone (quartz and wolfram mixed) is burned in heaps,
with layers of wood between the stone ; and owing to the
different degrees of expansion, the wolfram and quartz
are easily broken apart afterwards. The show is 20 miles
on from Molloy towards O.K. As to the latter mine,
North Queensland belief in it is still strong; but
Brisbane, which at one time held a very big interest in
it, cuts it dead, and has passed on practically all its hold-
ing to southerners. The co.’s half-year ended on Sept.
30, when it had cleared off all liabilities and accumulated
well over £20,000.

Some at least of the directors of Mt. Hector,
the Central Queensland copper show, much boomed and
heavily “burst,” evidently think Tub Bulletin was
right in saying that the Board should have included a
recommendation to close down in its recent report. Any-
way, it now circularises the shareholders, bidding them
to attend a meeting for the purpose of deciding the
question of closing down. For a certainty the share-
holders will stay away, some of them being too busy
trying to find someone to whom to pass the baby at the
absurd figure of 14s. per share.
* * * *
Great Fitzroy Copper Mine (Central Queens-
land) is feeling a little better at present, and is beginning
to spread itself in the press. Managed by Bewick, More-
ing and Co., none of its virtues are likely to be sup-
pressed when cash is required for further development
and plant. Fitzroy might be a payable proposition if it
had to carry, say, 200,000 shares, the bulk of which had
furnished £1 apiece for working. Even then a kindly
market for copper would be required. As it is, however,
the mine has to stagger under 500,000 shares, and
silicious ore does not like that burden.
» * * *
Directors of Pe&lc Downs (Q.) apparently now
recognise the hopelessness of the position of the co., for
they are understood to be appealing to Mb. Morgan
Co. to carry the thing on. But the Stock Exchange yarn
is slightly different in color. The tale goes round
Brisbane that the Mt. Morgan Co. is to take Peak Downs
over, and in effect is going to make Peak Downs share-
holders a present of one sovereign for every shilling
they can produce, and later on may give them the Mt.
Morgan mine just for letting them into Peak Downs. All of
which is a cold-blooded attempt to “ boost” the price of
shares. The real position at Peak Downs is one of utter
failure—financial, metallurgical, and mining. Despite
the fact that in the press it is reported that smelting
operations proceed satisfactorily (they are proceeding at
a loss), the co. finds it necessary to call up the last little
threepence, which will give it a paltry £lOOO. This sum
is already mortgaged. Of one thing the public had
better beware—they must not be gulled into think-
ing Mt. Morgan will do anything f ■ r the present share-
holders, except probably relieve them of a costly incubus.
Mt. Morgan Co. may want some of the Peak Downs
material, but it can only take it up on the basis of
ironstone. In its present hands, Peak Downs is just
about as valuable as an ironstone show, and that is not
much chop away in the interior.

The day of reconstruction has arrived at Clon-
curry (Q.). Willcocks’ Syndicate is to go into the pot;
present shares (1200) will be cut up into 84,000, and
threepenny calls provided for. The syndicate had bright
ideas of putting off no end of pups ; but in all the long
string of its properties, there isn’t one that it could get
the public to become even moderately interested in at
present.

Among old N.Q. fields that are getting some
notice again is the Ortona, on the Percy River, It is 110
miles S.W. of Georgetown, but via Hughenden (240
miles) the route is more practicable for teams, because
water is better that way. In the early days there were
many rushes to that part, with Woolgar as the pivot, and
the Perry field yielded several large nuggets. Long dis-
tances to haul and bad roads made only but the richest
reefs and alluvial workable, and at length the fields
fizzled. Chows are the main occupants now. But the
Etheridge railway will help to make another and a bigger
stir in those parts, though even the Etheridge railway
won’t improve the track south from Georgetown.

Lamentable news from Charters Towers : there
is to be no evening “ call ” ! Even the local sharebrokers
confess that some development must take place before
a revival can be expected. Mills’ United crushed 1952
tons for £9670; development work will prove deeper
ground about 400 ft. on the incline below No. 10.
Pfeiffer’s Day Dawn has an output of 500 tons a month ;
it has also a lot of ground available for stoping, and
intends to open out deeper levels. Pfeiffer’s is in
200,000 shares, which is a sobering consideration.
Phoebe is interesting because of the crosscut going in
at 775 ft. to pick up the George reef, which was found
to be payable 300 ft. below. Kelly’s, next door, has an
anxious eye on this development. Golden Alexandra
has better prospects ; its crushing of 1285 tons returned
£4 12s. 3d. per ton. The reef in the underlie shows im-
provement. Brilliant and St. George has also had a de-
velopment ; the sinking of the Identity shaft has been in
hard granite, but has intersected a formation about which
more will be heard when the flow of water has been
mastered. Ruby P.C. crushed 370 tons for £2427; but
the market doesn’t budge.

No. 2 S. Gt. Eastern, Gympie, comes out of the
gloom of poor crushings, during which men were sacked
and stampers hung up, with a find of payable gold in the
Inglewood reef. Scrip has doubled in value. But it is
premature to go nap on this development. One of the
characteristics of the Inglewood reef when traversing
favorable black-slate country is the presence of tellurides,
and the reef in the neighborhood of crosscourses contains
the richest patches of gold. That is noticeable
just now in No. 2 North Columbia, where rich specimens
have been obtained on both sides of a crosscourse. S.
Glanmire and Monkland is also prospecting the Ingle-
wood reef at a higher level, but so far has drawn a blank.
Better country is, however, likely in the direction of the
boundary, for No. 2 S. Great Eastern obtained payable
gold there. No. 2 reef, at the 1160 ft. level, is also showing a
few inches of rich stone going south, and the reef seems
to be improving in size and quality going north. Interest
still centres in the development of the Empire reef at the
Great Northern ; some geological theories have been vin-
dicated, and a small quantity of heavily mineralised stone,
assaying well for gold, has been found. But the excite-
ment is mostly anticipatory.

Veteran mine-manager Warren came down
from North Queensland last week, after pulling Smith’s
Greek out of the fire ; and Peter Brander, late of Chilla-
goe, is now in charge. The veteran tackled Smith’s
Creek as a forlorn hope, fossicked out the ore bodies
(which are disturbed by faults), developed a mine, and
put enough money in the till to pay a dividend before he
left. He went up for three months, battled along under
difficulties for about a year and a half, and was respon-
sible for the best recovery ever made by an appa-
rently blown-out North Queensland mine. Even now it
isn’t a big thing, by any means; but, if tin keeps a
reasonable price, there are a few divs. in the 11 backs ”
now waiting to be broken down.

The Queensland Government owns a coal mine
on the Dawson, but hasn’t got any good out of it so far.
The Admiralty tried the coal, and couldn’t get it to burn
freely ; and the Railway Department turned it down also.
But the Mt. Morgan people have stuck to the experi-
ments, and they reported the other day to Premier
Kidston that they had tried it in a furnace which had
been specially designed to burn sawdust. “With forced
draught, it burned excellently, with intense heat,” the
wire ran. “ Every prospect of coal being valuable with
similar or improved furnaces.”

Speculators had better beware of nor’-west
Westralia, which there is a tendency to boom just now.
There may be others, but mostly the mines appear to be
short shoots and shallow deposits. Such country may
pan out all right for small working parties, but so'far as
cos. are concerned it is best left alone. A man who
ought to know states, as the result of a personal inspec-
tion, that the much-talked-of Moolyella tin mine, in that
part of the West, is over-rated, and that its deposit does
not appear to be permanent.
* * * *
Manager Treloar says in his latest report to the
Princess Royal directors (W.A.) :“I told you we could
do without a call for August, and we may 7 be able to do
without calls in future; but to open up the mine with
the value of stone in sight will be a task, and I doubt if it
is not a very wrong - policy in the best interests of share-
holders. ... I am delighted at the prospect of getting the
south shoot again. I regard its discovery as a certainty,
and regret the fact that I have not the means to push on
with this development at once.... From what I have seen
since my return, and knowing the mine as I do, I have a
good opinion of the future, and believe that I can make
it profitable if the shareholders will only find the means.”
Shareholders were warned a few weeks ago that some-
thing iike this was going to be sprung on them, and
have therefore had plenty of time to put padlocks on
their pockets.
• * * T
Northern Blocks Syndicate (W. A.) is about to
go into liquidation. This concern is a pup of the Asso-
ciated Northern Blocks, and was formed in 1903 to take
three wild-cat leases off the parent co.’s hands. The
Associated Northern itself subscribed for half the shares,
and distributed the remainder, share for share, among
its indifferent shareholders. The new co. was thus turned
adrift with £17,500 to its credit, while the market got a
pew gambling counter. Failing to discover payable ore
in any of its three properties, the Syndicate afterwards
acquired the Leviathan lease at Southern Cross for £BOOO.
This mine furnished one or two good returns, and looked
promising for a time. The reef, however, went wrong in
depth ; then, to make matters worse, the funds gave out.
And that was the beginning of the end.
The slimes filter at the Sons of Gwalia (W.A.)
should increase the capacity of the tailings plant from
100 to 200 tons per day, and add about £lOOO to* The
monthly revenue. Both the main and Gwalia South shoots
are looking well in depth, and, judging by the improved
appearance of the bottom workings, bigger dividends may
come next year. At present the recoverable value of the
ore treated stands at about 28s. 6d. per ton, which is
much below the grade of the stuff how being mined’ in
the lower levels.
There appears to be nothing in the recent
report that the Brown Hill Extended had been offered to
the Oroya-Brown Hill Co. The question of getting the
latter concern to treat some rich ore remaining in the
north-west corner of the Extended lease was discussed,
but the yarn about t he Brown Hill ’Co. being asked to buy 7
the property is scouted by the directors of the Extended.
Faith in the Queensland Menzies Co.’s Good-
enough lease (W.A.) dies hard. It is now proposed to
raise more capital, and to give shareholders in the old co.
to apply for one share for every two shares now
held. The proceeds of the last reconstruction went
largely in a Johnny 7 Alborts kind of equipment and in
aimless prospecting. What guarantee have shareholders
and intending shareholders that the new money will not
be frittered away in some equally foolish manner? Also,
what guarantee have they that the mine is worth another
trial? Thege things need investigation.
Provided the shoots hold down, there is a bright
time ahead for Golden Ridge shareholders (W.A.). Pre-
sent profits would pay 50 per cent, per annum on the
capital, and but for the fact that there is a doubt of the
mine’s permanency, the shares would rank as the most
tempting speculation in the West. The main shaft is
down to 400 ft.; and if values prove to be anyway near as
good there as at the No. 2 and 3 levels, the market is
bound to receive a big lift.
« * • *
Steps are being taken at the Ida H., Laverton
(W.A.), to ascertain if prospects are good enough in the
bottom to justify the expenditure of about £9OOO on a
new shaft north of the present one. The shoot has pitched
further north at every level, and, at a depth of 500 ft., it
is fully 1000 feet from the main shaft. From this point a
winze has been sunk a further 100 ft. in good stone, and
should the work now about to be started prove these
values to extend laterally as well as in depth, the new
shaft alluded to will be put down.
* * » *
The heavy fall in copper is a stunning blow to
Phillips River (W.A.) and the Kaufman crowd. By pick-
ing out the best ore the mines there may yield good
profits for a time; but unless copper springs again,
Phillips River’s cake will soon be dough.
* * * *
Chicks have come home to roost with Sewell,
Flowerday, and others interested in the Duke Junction,
up Maryborough way (Vic.). Burnt Creek, next door,
has been pumping millions daily 7, and the Duke Junction
has been watching with lazy content. But in the
Burnt Creek are some of the Finks, and one James
Randell, who can see as far into a brick wall as
nine other people. Having pumped enough water
to partly drain the Duke Junction ground, the
Burnt Creek crowd want it for their own. Sewell
and Co. resist, of course. Where the fun comes in is
that Sewell and friends backed up the opponents of the
tribute system at the Sebastopol Plateau mines. They
may not have seen, of course, that to hold ground while
it is being drained by the man next door is to take a form
of tribute—a practice to which they declared they were
bitterly opposed. Whether they saw it or not, The
Bulletin now presents them with the fact, and suggests
tha t they should hand over the lease to the other people,
and be pleasant about it. If they don’t, somebody will
remind them of how Minister McLeod acted over the
Dyason lease at Castlemaine.

Widow J. A. Wallace, who, some time back,
had to defend her administration of old J. A.’s estate, is
quitting the sluicing shows up Beechworth way (Vic.).
Young Wallace is understood to have taken some of them
on, and thus proves himself plucky, for the Sludge Board
may at any time call for settling dams ar.d other impedi-
menta to keep the sludge off the land down near Wanga-
ratta. Anyway, the widow is well out of them. Now
she is offering another nice claim—the Woolshed—worth
£2OOO or so a year. Mine-sec. Rollason has that business
in hand. Tenders close on Oct. 21.

Alexandra Reefs, Alexandra (Vic.), is a mine
with a history, and, like most things of that sort, it wants
watching. Thus, not long since, it opened out a level,
got about enough gold to gild a pawnbroker’s sign, let a
tribute, saw a 4oz. crushing come, determined the
tribute, and never got more than calls afterwards. Which
means, not that the tributors should be suspected, but
that the ground is patchy, just as it always is in claims
up that side of the mountains. The present co. is now
having a shot at an old shaft, and has got on to gold. It
is a prospect only that in no way disproves the belief
that rich gold does not live down in the local reefs.
* * m *
Bendigo folk believe that their battery work is
so good that no one can ever get enough gold out of the
tailings dumps to make the process pay. The assay value
is probably about Idwt. Dozens of trials have been made,
but so far local belief has been sustained, as all the cash
put in has been lost. Nevertheless, another syndicate is
on the job, having obtained a tribute over the Catherine
Reef, Hercules and Energetic, and Koch’s Pioneer heaps.
These are all big dumps, and the cos. are to get a royalty
of 3d. per ton. The coarseness of the gold or the asso-
ciated mineral may tell against good cyanide work. If it
doesn’t, there will be a big rush to put up vats below all
the batteries ; and then another chip will be knocked off
Bendigo’s very good opinion of itself.

A month or two ago much energy was put into
an attempt to revive interest in Tarcoola (S. Aus.),
on the strength of the discovery of a continuation of the
Tarcoola Blocks “line of lode.” (Fancy calling that
bunch of quartz threads traversing a dyke a “ line of
lode”!) The bubble was pricked, however, by Tolmer,
manager of the Government mine at Tarcoola. His
sampling gave at most 2dwt. but generally nil. As the
Blocks Co. has averaged over loz. per ton for years past
and yet is always in financial trouble (it is practically hung
up at the present), things look blue for the “ new find.”
There is one fairly strong kick left in the Blocks Co., viz
a good crosscut from the vertical shaft instead of the
ridiculous gouging from underlays which has been the
system for so many years. The mine has eaten up a deal
of money, got partly from the matrix and partly from
shareholders pockets; but it can’t get ahead—for
one thing, the “ gold ” is only worth about £3 Is. per oz.:
and for another, it is hard to mine.

Some Queensland people believe they have got
hold of the biggest, richest, and (from one point of view'
most accessible iron-ore deposit in Australia at Yampi
bound. Yampi Sound is about 100 miles from Derby, in
the far north-west, and the only way of reaching it at
present is by creeping along the coast in a small boat.
.Nevertheless a man lias been up pegging it out and
getting samples, and he passed through Sydney this
week on his way back to Queensland. The stuff goes
over 60 per cent, iron ; but analyses have yet to prove its
purity. Unfortunately it isn’t for the supply of Aus-
tralian furnaces that a sale is expected. An English syndi-
cate proposes to establish the iron industry at Singapore,
and that is where a market will be sought. As described,
the ore-deposit at Yampi comes right down to the water’s
edge ; in fact, the cliffs are made of it, and alongside, in
a sheltered p sition, there is 10 fathoms of water. But,
so far, admittedly, everything depends upon whether the
ore is free from phosphorus, etc.
Apropos the Singapore iron-industry project, the
promoters are considering turn possible sources of coal
supply. One is a new find near Lahore ; the other is a
Borneo field, from which fine samples of coking coal have
been taken. Men who are interested in the latter say it
is going to be a big thing.

The Bulletin, having a vacancy on its staff,
wants to hear from a bright w’riter with a sound know-
ledge of finance.
The Aerial Tramways which have been erected
for the British and Sulphide Corporation (Central) Mines
at Broken Hill are fine examples of present-day skill and
technical knowledge. The Mines will effect considerable
saving by means of these Aerial ways as compared with
any other known mechanical contrivance for i andling
ores on a large scale. The; British Mine will economise
to over 2s. per ton. These two plants have already been
subjected to severe tests, and have amply demonstrated
their worth and ability. Both Aeriahvays were supplied
by W. & J. Leinpriere, of Melbourne, who represent A.
Bleichert & Co., of London, the largest firm in the world
for the manufacture of transport appliances.*

One set of Improved Plunger Pumps, Cornish
type, is at present being constructed for the Berry United
Gold Mines, to the order of Messrs. Bewick, Moreing and
Company. The set will consist of 3 lifts, each of 200 ft.,
the total lift being 600 ft. The Plungers are 26in. in
diameter and 10ft. stroke, and the discharge 2,500,000
gallons per day. The valve boxes are made in separate
pieces, instead of forming part of one H piece, and the
valves are of the compound fla p type. The total weight
is 110 tons. The Austral Otis Engineering Company have
this work in hand. This Company has constructed and
erected most of the big volume, deep alluvial plants now
working in Victoria.

Business Education.—A tree is known by its
fruit, a business school by its successes in public exami-
nations and the demand of business men for its gradu-
ates. In both these respects Stott and Hoare’s Business
College stands at the head. A single instance will ex-
emplify the first claim : At all Government Examina-
tions for Shorthand Writers and Typists, held during the
past five years, students have won first place. As to the
second, not only does every student as soon as competent
secure an appointment, but the demand for graduates
greatly exceeds the supply. It is a mistake in these
times "to put a boy to business immediately he has passed
through his primary or high-school course; years of
poorly-paid drudgery will be saved him, and his pros-
pects of advancement will be greatly enhanced by giving
him a sound modern business educatiop at this well-

“Full-up”: As a nabive-born Australian
bushman, I want to protest against the much-
printed “yer,” given forth to the world as part of
the bush vernacular. Of course, we don’t gram-
marise and enunciate “according to Cocker.”
Life for ordinary bushmen is too short. We use
two negatives, compound comparatives, double
superlatives, etc., and we mostly say “yous
blokes,” but we don’t say “ yer.” Possibly I lack
humor ; but, look you, I’ve toiled nigh on fifty
years in all the States; “yakkerea”at dry-blow-
ing on Kimberley and Coolgardie m the early
days, swung shovel, axe, stockwhip and shear-
blades in all the eastern States, Tassy, and
Maoriland, and I say emphatically that whatever
bushman say they do not say “ yer.”
“ Jimmie Pannikin ”: I have been wander-
ing amidst wattles for weeks, through the Closer-
in-Country, saturating myself with the sight and
smell of the loveliest flowering tree in all the
world. The many-millioned magnificence of our
glorious tree of the cloth-of-gold affects me curi-
ously. It makes me endeavor to say all the
thanksgiving prayers that are forgotten in the
strenuous and sometimes selfish daily grind. I
want to organise a party of real Australians (who
already have the sympathetic attitude towards
Nature) to travel the wattle wonderland between
Binda and Bigga next spring. The golden
splendor of our bush is now beginning to tarnish
and fade. Nature-lovers can start straight away
to save up their pennies for a personally con-
ducted tour next spring, or for a trip marked out
by me, and followed according to individual
tastes and times and temperaments. I’d like to
guide a party of sunbaked outbackers, and give
them a never-to-be-forgotten feast of color and
scent quite essentially Australian. As an old and
intermittently-valued contributor and originator
of competitions, I ask you to publish this par, so
that Nature-lovers (pecuniarily poor if rich other-
wise) may start to get ready for the wonderful
wattle carnival of 1908.

“ Hamer ” : He the Maori discussion. It is
a noticeable fact that all the champions of Maori
nobility lift their voices from the Poverty Bay
district ; but their testimony in that district does
not effect the truth of general statements about
the Maori as he is in other parts of Maoriland. I
have frequently remarked that the Gisborne
Maori is the best type of them all; and that he is
a wonderful contrast to his brother in other dis-
tricts. And for this the local Maori Council is to
be thanked. The Maori is a child in disposition ;
and, as with any other child, his training is every-
thing. Thus in districts where those who should
have been his guardians are unfit, the Maori is
mostly a dirty, vicious and disagreeable child. The
gentlemen of the Gisborne Council, however, are
themselves of Maori blood, and are clear-sighted
and disinterested. They have the power to
destroy insanitary dwellings, and to compel
Brown Brother to live in a civilised fashion.
They exercise that power, and in doing so insist
on Brown Brother doing some work, which policy
is part of his salvation. Most of the balance of
his salvation is the ban which the Council has put
upon alcohol. If a Gisborne Maori, with a beery
desire in his eye, is seen in the vicinity of
a pub, it is the duty of every other Maori in
the vicinity to keep him out of it. The most
stimulating drink obtainable in the pahs is
orange champagne, which sounds a cheerful drink,
but isn’t. “Bromide” doubts, and “ Pakeha ”
even, a Gisbornite himself, is not certain, that the
Maori “grafters,” mentioned by another corre-
spondent, were full-blooded Maoris. Quite likely
they were. In the Poverty Bay district, where
the best Maori resides, there is probably less race
mixture than in any other part of the country.
“Agricola” : A few of the old generation of
bullockies still make their own bullock-bells. The
material of which they are constructed is old saw-
metal—pit-saws for preference, though serviceable
bells can be manufac-
tured from an old
cross-cut saw of
good quality. The
metal is heated,
'and then beaten
as nearly to the
shape of a bull-
frog bell as the
skill of the
worker permits.
The mouth is
narrow, and the
upper part
• widens out con-
siderably. The
sides are riveted
with any old
thing wire
nails, fragments
of No. 8 fencing
wire, etc. The
tongue is made by
fixing an old nut on
a nail, the end of which
is clenched at the top of
the bell. The admiring owner
assures you that, with an old
saw-bell, he can locate his bullocks at any
range up to seven miles. The distance varies
in direct proportion to his lack of veracity.
Anyway, the fact remains that this home-made
article is equal to the best imported in sound
capacity.

“ Caber ” : “ Oby ” (B. 19/9/’O7) descants
on the blackfellow’s veneration for native flora,
and wants us to believe a fanciful yarn about
niggers being killed for cutting down trees. It is
true Black Brother didn’t cut down trees ; but
that was from fear, not of death, but of hard
work. When a nigger wants a ’possum or a bees’
nest, he climbs his tree by cutting steps up to his
dinner. With the bunya, however, he uses a
supplejack vine, slinging himself up the branch-
less barrel. The tomahawk must not be used on
a bunya tree, and probably would mean an execu-
tion if it was. Have never seen a notch on one
yet, but have known Queensland sawtnillers to
cut up hundreds of them, contrary to a stringent
law for their protection. “ Oby ” was probably
thinking of the bunya. No other tree is sacred
to the blackfellow.

“S.G.”: Let all the “Abo” scribblers
turn green with envy, for I know where there’s a
lyre-bird’s nest. It was just finished when I
found it; a big nest, set only 2ft. from the
ground, but beautifully made, with an arched
roof, fashioned of twigs and the woven fibres of
the fern-tree trunk. (Read that slowly.) Then
the egg was laid ; about the size of a hen’s, slaty-
blue, with medallions of black (’tis a girl writes
this!) The chick happened along the other day—
an ugly little thing only half-dressed in bhick
down, outlined with bare skin. The mother-bird
doesn’t mind me. She eagerly eats the worms
that I give her. I always thought before that they
were frightened things ! (I don’t mean the worms.)
WORSE.
CONSTABLE (to North Queenslander who has struck Sydney under the new Sunday liquor law ,
and has in vain assailed the doors of various pubs); “ What's the matter with ye[?]
Is it mad dhrunk ye are?"
N.Q.: “ Worse, constable, far worse; it’s mad sober I am."
“Lantana” : According to experts, the
best grass known to the world as a fertiliser in
sandy wastes is Melilotus officinalis. It was
introduced into King Island, off the South coast
ot Australia, through the wreck of a Dutch baraue,
many years ago. Some mattresses washed ashore
from the wreck were stuffed with the grass, the
seeds of which germinated in the sand, and m the
course of years the tufts spread over the whole
coastal area, and converted a barren fringe of
country into one of the richest areas in the Com-
monwealth. Melilotus is really a kind of clover,
much like Bokhara clover, and, being a leguminous
plant, it absorbs nitrogen from the atmosphere
and transfers it to the soil, thus transforming raw
white beach sand into dark brown, and sometimes
black, soil in the course of not so very many
years.
* * * *
“ Groper ” : You are wrong when you
state (B. 22/8/’O7) that land found Katanning
(W. A.) costs £3 10s. to £4 10s. an acre to clear. I
have, under my eye now, a contract let to clear at
225., and the contractors consider they have, a
good price. This is for green timber. Dry tim-
ber I have seen done for 10s., though that is rather
a short price. [Then ‘'Groper” had better quarrel
with the Westralian Lands Department. In its
“Guide to Selection” it states that clearing
in the Katinning district runs up to £6 per acre.
—Ed. B.] The low average in the wheat yield
last year, round Katanning and Wagin, was not
due so much to the fact that poor land was
cropped, as to the dry season. There were no
October rains. For the last eight years (it may
be longer) rain has always fallen at the end of
October, thus ensuring good crops. This
Westralian land is pounds better than it
looks. The finest crop east of the railway
this year is growing in sand, with, of
course, superphosphate. There is the, case of a
wheat crop grown in sand and bonedust, that
averaged 25 bushels to the acre. This is no fable.
In the extreme southern and south-western dis-
tricts, where fruit is grown equal to the best in
the other States, the land is chiefly ironstone
rubble, or black sand. Of course, all good land
near the line is taken up. There are men
selecting 30 miles from the line who will come out
on top. There are others taking inferior stuff closer
in who will probably go down. There are old men
putting their hard-won earnings on to land that
wouldn’t keep a fasting mule. The land here
may not be as good for farming as in the other
States, but -the climatic conditions are excellent.
The rainfall is certain. [Then there’s something
wrong with the excuse given above to account for
last season’s failure. —Ed. B.] Big landlords
are few. Piesse holds about 3000 acres round
Katanning, and 30,000 acres of poison land at
Kojonup. Goblup Estate, four miles west, con-
tains 25,000 acres, though this has been split up
among three. Another holding comprised until
lately 40,000 acres. This has been divided among
a few. In them (the holdings) is the usual mix-
ture of good and bad land. If any of your staff
should weary of spilling ink, send them to those
parts east of the Great Southern line, and they’ll
not regret it. There are going to be all sorts of
good things in the future—spur lines, and pubs
within 10 miles. (The nearest pub is 30 miles
away at present, and even at that range I can
hear the beer a-calling.)

“ Snell ” : Will the Aboriginalities special-
ist permit me to start a disputation of anthropo-
logical importance? During the Show week in
Melbourne I have had peculiar opportunities
of studying the bush Australian, and am struck
by his strong contrast with the city-bred type.
Aboriginality contributors should be able to
supply matter of interest and some scientific value
in its bearing on the race idiosyncrasies of the
man from Out Back and Over There, by stating
what they have found to be the most marked
difference between the Australian townie and
the Australian bushie. A distinguished Aus-
tralian churchman declared recently that he could
pick a Methodist out of a miscellaneous crowd by
his countenance. But how would an observant
recorder of aboriginalities identify a bushie as a
bushie in a mixed assemblage in town ? The
solution is not as simple as it seems, since the
bushie grades into the townie by easy stages, and
the townie slopes into a bushie in nice, half-mile
gradations ; but there are quaint peculiarities in
Bill Bushie by which he can be identified. Let
them be recorded.
* * * *
“ Boronia ” (he writes from Westralia,
and so enters into a certain snake controversy
rather late): —
It is not necessary to place your headgear in front of a
passing snake to arrest the attention of the long sub-
stance. A jam-tin has the same effect, or, if you do not
happen to have one concealed about you, your boot will
do. I once tried the experiment, and it terminated
fatally for the boot. Was walking along (that is the only
way you can walk) when I perceived a small black snake
coming towards me. I whipped off a hoof-case and
deposited it in the track of the reptile. Instead of the
reptile stopping to gaze at the obstacle while I went in
search of a young tree wherewith to commit murder, it
calmly climbed inside and went to sleep. Being afraid to
empty the snake out of its mansion, I went in search of a
gun, and after a two-mile tramp on one boot I borrowed
the artillery from a selector. 1 then went back to the
occupied boot, and not before the magazine of the rifle
was exhausted did I attempt to inspect the damage com-
mitted. The snake was quite dead. So was the boot.
No more of those experiments for me. It made me
trudge four miles with one boot, and cost me the price of
two new boots.
* * * *
“Douglas T.” : At my present country
seat there is a tame kangaroo. Its habits, and
the expression on its weird prehistoric “dial,”
have been puzzling me very much lately. One
striking peculiarity—a quaint method of hauling
a portion of its back-blocks to the front, for
scratching purposes—seems to suggest a Lost Art.
If a dog approaches the marsupial with an air of
friendliness, the sudden elevation to full height,
and the look of contempt with which it treats the
proposed familiarity, are worth the price of
several beers to look at. Occasionally the ’roo
sprints round a circle of considerable diameter, at
a devil of a pace. Wonder if this denotes a sub-
conscious recollection of some circus business in
the Stone Age? Frequently, too, I find the
animal in deep thought, with a retrospective ex-
pression in its eyes, as if it were communing with
the spirits of illustrious ancestors of the miocene
period. Rely upon it, there are parts of the
kangaroo’s thinking machine that we know
nothing about.

AN ECHO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wide the grass was spreading , and the plain sloped down
before us —
Hillock and hollow and mossed and rocky mound ;
Faintly and clear came the bush birds’ ringing chorus
Out of gum and she-oak bower in snatches sweet of
sound.
Grandly rose the mountains, one long-gone September,
Crag and peak and dim crest, stalely and still,
Where we went a-riding, say, love, do you remember
Where the Wannon Water ivinds around the hill?
Down by the Long Point, where the station cattle
Grouped ’neath the shady red-gum trees,
Sweet came a breath of the yellow-blooming wattle
Up from the green river leas.
Murmuring low was the music of the river,
Rippling by rocky pool and rill ;
That was a lost day, past and gone for ever,
Where the Wannon Water swirls around the hill.
Clatter of the wild duck, startled from the rushes,
Blossom and bud unnamed, unknown ;
One winding bridle-track thro’ the tangled bushes,
One by one the brown horse and the roan.
Now where the feathered grass is thick by the river,
Up through the grey scrubs still,
Love and Joy and lost Youth gone, gone for ever
Where the Wannon Water sweeps around the hill.
One curl of white mist, floating down the hollow,
Sunbeams in a tangled golden maze ;
One spot where two kissed, sweet it was to follow
Love along the lonely bushland ways.
Lost, lost its magic ; where the tall reeds quiver
Old days are over, and old songs are still;
Only the winds are whispering just as ever
Where the Wannon Water curves around the hill.
Grey heart and grey heart, and ever weary-hearted,
Little ken I now, love, of you ;
Quick or dead, I know not, long ’tis since we parted,
Wide our paths, since bygone days we knew.
Only the murmured music of the river
Never through the ages is still.
Only the mountains stately are as ever,
Where the Wannon Water swings around the hill.
Only the bush birds’ mirth still is never failing,
Only the dim shades fall
Just the same as ever, when the skies are paling
In pearly veil and purple pall.
Only an idyll of the old grey river,
An echo that lingers still,
When I lie o’ nights and listen to the frogs that chorus
ever,
Where the Wannon Water winds around the hill.

“Walfre”: Re B. par (5/9/’O7), concern-
ing the late courthouse-yard gum tree at Broken
Hill. There’s absolutely no reason for hysteria on
the part of “Emu Bush.” The felled gum
was already half-dead. Also, the spot where
it formerly stood is now planted with peppers,
which are the only trees that will grow a length of
time on the Hill. Gums invariably die in from 10
to 15 years. Better—argue the locals—a healthy
pepper than a moribund gum ; and this deponent,
for one, agrees with them.
AN OBVIOUS INSULT.

“Hamer”: Murwfflumbah (N.S.W.), re-
cently wiped out by fire, was a great place for
sualtes. One Sunday the local clergyman was
shocked by the inattention of his congregation;
everybody seemed to be staring at something
above his head. He looked upward and saw' a
snake in a suspended attitude. It was his busy
day. and after he had helped the congregation to
slay the representative of iniquity he discovered
another snake in the vestry. This made him late
for dinner, so he hurried home, and on the vicarage
verandah he encountered another snake. This
made him still later for dinner—in fact, the
sausage was quite cold.
THE COMING OF THE CAMEL.
ABDUL THE BEAUTIFUL : “ Dear I Dear!
How coy and distant these bushmen are to the hapless wanderer in these parts!”
“ Janor ” : Harold and Reginald, coming
to fisticuffs over the manner of working their
alluvial claim, dissolved partnership with a jerk.
It wasn’t much to quarrel over, for, during the
couple of months they had been at work, the
ground had only yielded sufficient gold to pay
the store account. However, it was that or the
track, so a coin being spun for choice, the claim
was divided. Reginald won the toss, and cun-
ningly selected the unworked portion of the area,
leaving the working face and a big slice of de-
pleted bottom to Harold. Then they put in their
pegs, and regis-
tered their hold-
ings. There was
but one waterhole
in the creek, so
they marked off
this with a piece
of chalk, or some-
thing, and each
washed his wash-
dirt on his proper
side. Thus a fort-
night passed, dur-
ing which time
Harold’s claim
panned out tuck-
er, while Reginald
failed to raise the
color. Then, one
hot day, they met
at the waterhole,
and each panned
away for a while
in grim silence.
But presently the
speechlessness of
things was broken
by that sound
which, once heard,
1 is never forgotten
—the grunt of
coarse gold on the
bottom of the dish,
and it is the
sweetest sound in
all the world to
the digger. It
came from Har-
old’s dish, and in
a flash he had the
sweet singer in his
hand, and a pretty
nugget it was, of
about three
ounces. Reginald
had a good view
of it, and his eyes
bulged, and envy
j j • _
. and despair tug-
ged his innards. His dish was again a duffer.
He straightened his aching back and cursed
in three languages. A jackass smiled audibly
from an overhanging gum branch. The un-
lucky man seized his dish, and hurled it at the
bird, and missed. “Oh!” he moaned, “God’s
got a blanky down on me,” and he fled through the
scrub. Six months have elapsed, and he remains
fled.
“Larrikin”: When will some writer
arise and paint the Australian bush girl of the
people as she is? We’ve had ’em all brands.
Now, sit tight and let me tell you that the bush
girl, as I know her, wears a man’s hat, a blouse
flying loose in the breeze, a curtailed skirt, and a
pair of hob-nailed men’s boots. She shouts like a
man, can swear like a trooper, rides astride, can
kill a sheep and butcher it well—in fact, the bush
girl can do any mortal thing she puts her hand to.
And when sickness comes along, the bush girl is
as gentle and as clean as any town girl I ever
struck 1
“Lindy Lou ” : The other day, while out
shooting, I saw a crow sitting patiently on the
end of a hollow log. Thought it good enough to
watch him—the pesky brutes always want watch-
ing—so planted behind some scrub. Nothing
happened for some minutes, so I thought it up to
me to collect a tray-bit from the Pastures Protec-
tion Board for his scalp. Just then a rabbit poked
his head out of the hollow, and scored the crow’s
eye-picker just where the chicken got the axe.
Bunny lay very still, either knocked out
or dead. Anyway, he knew for certain
very shortly, for his eyes were out, and
his entrails scattered about, in three seconds
under evens. The crow said nothing about
his catch to anyone, but five of his cousins
arrived from nowhere, just as he had comfortably
reached the kidney fat. He didn’t receive them
very cordially, but they bustled him and called
him horrible names, so he went off and sulked by
himself in a big tree. In a minute or so there
wasn’t a scrap of any of the dainties left for him,
only just the ordinary meat. I spared him, as he
had at least got rid of one of our rabbits; but I
carried home one of the bushrangers instead, and
now his head adorns a nail in the corner of the
harness-room.
“Nil Apropos “ Yarrum” (B. 12/9/’O7).
A drummer acquaintance of mine was doing his
beat on “ the Peninsula ” (Yorke’s Peninsula,
S.A.), and met a cocky, cet. 30, who had just re-
turned from his first trip to “ Airdlid.” Asked
how he liked it, and what he had seen, he replied,
“Airdlid’s all right. There’s a turble lot of
houses and things. Whips o’ pubs. Them
trams is all right. I seen a lot of queer things in
Airdlid all right. I can’t reck’lect what they was,
but they was all right, all'right ! There was one
place I seen, I don’t reck’lect what they called
it. They was a lot of yards and pens with things
in ’em. All right, they was. The best I seen
was some things in a kind of a cage. What was
it they was called ? Oh, you know ! Er— what was
it ? Oh yes ! Monks ! That was it! They was
all right! ”
“F.H.R.”: The forest devil used in many
parts of Australia is a devil of a machine when it
breaks. We were hooked on to an ancient yel low box
tree once. The devil was attached to the butt of
another hoary forester, and the machinery was
supplied by a horse and a twenty-foot lever. I
was hooking up. About seventy feet of steel bars
were straining from half way up the tree to the
devil. And I wanted just another inch to hook
up for the last pull, which is always away from
the tree. The old grey bent down to it, but it was
still three-eighths short. “ A bit more,” I yelled
to the driver, and he gave the grey a tap on
the neck with his hand. Now that honorable
animal was never used to chastisement, and he
resented this slur on his character. He threw his
head down and pulled. The yellow-box veteran
shook his head and trembled in every leaf, but
stood firm. Something had to go, for nearly half
a ton of good Australian horse was pulling for his
reputation’s sake, and alas ! the imported slack-
chain of steel parted with a crack like an old
Enfield rifle fired in a jam-tin. Ten steel bars
hurtled round me, and I experienced the feeling
of being speared at (and missed) by a horde of
myalls. I escaped with a broken finger and a big
scare. The old grey, though he saved his reputa-
tion as a scratch puller, turned a complete somer-
sault, and in its whirlings the lever carefully
banged on Joe’s stomach. After the local smith
had repaired the chain we took our revenge out of
the ancient forester—all except Joe, whose stomach
is lame to this day.
THE STRANGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I pull sheep up the dirty race, and bark them down
again ;
I watch the sun go raging by, in sweat and thirst and
pain ;
I hold the flocks along the fence, and curse them as they
break,
And when I’m through I think upon the massive wage I
make ;
I smoke and stroll along the creek, on Sundays, in the
cool,
And see old Foo asleep, and call myself a feckless fool
To toil for five bob less than he—a quid’s his weekly haul
For tending white spring-onions, tender onions, sweet
and small.
The lonely, lounging alien, tripping down from row to
row,
Puts in his mornings crawling round to watch green
runners grow ;
Asparagus and broccoli he nurses, careful, fond,
With spinach all about his hut, and artichokes beyond ;
And while I nurse my woes and sneer to see the easy
ground,
Which blossoms like the rose may grab his easy
pound,
The alien, grinning, yellow, beams beneath his heathen
hat
On twenty kinds of garden- trir.k, all down the verdant
flat.
He hoes and teeters in and out among the peas and beans
To keep the Old Man’s tissues right with good, fresh fruit
and greens,
And while I work in perfumed wool and roar at smelly
sheep,
He’s spending pleasant hours enwrapt in dope-enchanted
sleep;
Or, like a lady-gardener, he trowels here and there,
To keep the carrots blooming in his garden, green and
fair.
He draws a quid ! And fifteen bob’s my wretched toiler’s
rate
To pay my way and keep my future family off the State.
I start at dawn, with open shirt, all ready for the fray ;
I pull grey sheep along the race; I bark and curse all
day;
All day the blaze is on my neck, as up and down I go ;
I cart my cross—eight hours of toil—for half-a-crown or
so ;
And when I think of how I stand hot dust and stinging
flies,
I see red blood aflood before my sore, half-blinded eyes ;
For Jimmy, with his hungry grasp upon my native land,
Is there, and—curse him ! —grinning, with a weed-rake in
his hand.

J.R.: The Foreign-traders who say Australia
does not produce timbers suitable for sulky-building and
chair-making are merely ignorant of the products of their
own country. One of Sydney’s best-known carriage-
builders affirms that the best wood in the world for sulky-
making is Australian spotted gum, and that there are
numbers of Australian pines also suitable, likewise kauri,
which, of course, mostly comes from Maoriland. For
chair-making we have quite a variety : Queensland maple,
a species of elm, Tasmanian blackwood, and—most beauti-
ful of all for artistic chairs and furniture —the Australian
rosewood, whiohisaN.S.W. timber. We can also utilise the
bamboo, and a Queensland man recently forwarded par-
ticulars of some hitherto unused woods which he had
found make up excellently for chairs. So under these
circumstances there is no need for the Australian to sit
on the floor on account of the duty on chairs. Now
experiments are being made with an Australian timber
with a view to producing bentwood furniture
Bothered Bushy : It signifies “ not elsewhere included.”
....Solentes :“Navvy ”is short for navigator. He was
originally a maker of canals for purposes of internal navi-
gation.... 8. : Yes, it was a fine example of anti-Aus-
tralian malignity to order the kiddies at the school
demonstration to sing “ Sunny New South Wales ”
instead of the more national song, f‘ Advance Australia
Fair.” But if you expected the S. M. Herald to sympa-
thise with your grievance in the matter you were liable
to be badly left. The Herald can take an all-Australian
view when it is a question of falsely and slanderously
charging Australia in general with having treated certain
shipwrecked sailors “ like pirates, or worse,” but that
seems to be almost the only all-Australian view it has
about it One in the Joke : Thanks. It doesn’t strike
us as anything very immense in the way of a joke ;
still it was fresh and cheerful in its way...
Mollie Mac W.: (1) You dispute the statement that Maori-
land “charges about a million to public works fund.”
Well, for year ended March ’O6 it charged £1,012,404, and
the average of the five years before that was £870,774.
These are the State Statistician’s published figures.
(2) Your assurance that “all income and expendi-
ture are set forth most clearly,” etc., is absurd.
Apparently you have no financial knowledge of your
your own, and are taking the Budget as gospel. (3) The
naive statement that all is well because only about
£27,000,000 of the debt has no productive works to show
for it is too beautiful for words. That record of fraud,
cowardice, dishonesty, and plain swindle is almost un-
paralleled, and just as soon as the foreign loan-money
ceases to come in the results of having about the
biggest unproductive debt per head on earth will be
felt. (4) Your statement that Maoriland securities
stand “higher than any Australian stock” is another
case of taking somebody’s yarn for granted. (September
19 in London, Maoriland 3 per cents., £B5 10s.; Tasmanian
ditto, £BB ; Victorian ditto, £B7). And Maoriland is still
paying 4 per cent, for borrowed money, which shows that
its credit is pretty bad. Also there are other absurdities...
W.J.H. : Alec. Forrest’s ’79 expedition (Feb. 25 to Oct.
6) mapped the country from the De Grey River to Daly
Waters, on the Overland Telegraph line —he had to rush
300 miles for the telegraph line “owing to sick com-
panions and provisions falling short.” From a practical
point of view, the trip was highly successful, as he
found some of the most valuable country in the northern
part of W.A. His report was followed by the Johnston-
Hardman survey part}'; and its report led up to the
Kimberley gold rush Radium: Your suggestion that
a competition in bad dreams be started in the “ Abo.”
column touches no responsive chord in this office.
Dreams, even the most horrible, are such idle, negligible
things as to be hardly worth lying about A Victim
(Forbes): No, it isn’t genuine. In fact, it is a darned

railways is sft. 3in. This is the Victorian gauge,

The rest of the S.A. lines are 3ft. 6in....5.8. :
The paper which said that David Syme had a “con-
trolling interest,” or any kind of an interest, in Tiie
Bulletin was a liar. More than that, it was a conscious
liar, and invented its own lie. Every Bulletin share-
holder, save one, is inside The Bulletin office, and work-
ing on the paper. The one shareholder who isn’t work-
ing on the paper was its founder and for many years its
editor, and he is out of harness through ill-health
Dux: That yarn about Henare and the missus and
the picanniny and the bottle used to be an Australian
aboriginal narrative, and Henare was Binghi then
Onslow : Your wretched verses about Squires are weeks
behind the times. “On Slow ” doesn’t express you.
You should call yourself “On Dead.” The other
verses are a trifle worse than those about Squires
J.M.N, : Pretty little bits, but quite out of our line
A.J.S. : The basket swallowed it accordingly ...Stella:
Rather pleasing, but just like 10,000 other such mildly
sentimental effusions... .R. W. Ripon : You have humor

Wang: Its literary shortcomings are too great
Mallet: “ Jimmy ”is weak. The other is better, but is
spoilt by bad metre F.E.M. : Not too bad for a first
attempt. You have the gift of terseness, at all events...
Phoggarty : Don’t care for either of them Summer B :
Has a trace of power, but is otherwise awkward and un-
skilful Jet: Shows the inexperienced hand, but pro-
mises better things W.P.K. : Sorry they don’t suit

most ingenious, arouse no enthusiasm in this office....
G.E.B. : Go to ! Cannot Maoriland, with its riot of sense-
less public holidays to commemorate the births of utterly
unimportant over-sea royalties, spare one holiday to sig-
nalise its own birth as a Dominion ? Again, G.E.8.,

marks,” though it might have been a lot better
E.D.H.: Rather far-fetched and feeble ...Diomed: You
don’t make your meaning clear enough Tommy G.:

JAWBONE NEILD ON THE TARIFF,
“It rests In s cradle bearing a dutv of
\X?£~r£
are under a 27% per
cent, duty, and the
blankets a duty of
J 3 per cent., while
the coverlet bears
a 27% per cent,
duty. The baby
linen bears a duty
of 44 per cent.”
' ‘‘Under the unfederal Federal
tariff, the Australian baby has
a terrible burthen of taxation
to bear from
the hour of
its birth.” _
‘The infant’s basin Is charged
per cent., the sponge 38/ 2 per cent.”
“The feeding bottle is loaded
with 38K per cent. If the little
one requires physic,
there is 27>i per
• cent, to pay upon
it, and about 60 per
cent, upon the bottle
that contains it.”
•• Now let us look at the infant grown
to boyhood, and at schoolboy age. His
underclothing is taxed 49% per cent. ;
his shirt 44 per cent.; his sox 33 per
cent.; his suit 44 per cent. When he
starts for school he wears a hat or cap
at 38% per cent., and his satchel has
also paid 38% per cent, duty The
articles used by him at school, which
before Federation could have been pur-
chased for £l, now cost upwards of
£1 Bs. 4d.”
It is now up to the Australian baby
to consider whether life is worth (
living.
“ How is the tax-strangled
Australian baby to compete
with the tax-free British'
infant?” i
This means to the buyer of
these simple necessaries that it
now requires £j Bs. to purchase
what could, before Federation,
have been bought for £l.”
•• When the Australian
dies there is 27 y 2 per cent,
duty on his coffin ; a duty
of 27>4 per cent, upon his
shroud ; 22 per cent, upon
the organ "that plays his re-
quiem ; 27 >4 per cent, upon the
harness of the horses that draw
his hearse; 3S/ 2 per cent, upon
the hearse that bears his remains
to the cemetery.”
Naturally, under these circumstances,
the consistent Freetrade corpse would
“ refuse to be drawn,”
and would walk to the
cemetery on his own.
There being a heavy duty on
cosmetics, the question is :
Will Colonel Jawbone Neild
appear upon parade with un-
waxed moustaches, or will he
compromise and wax one side
only ? 'V
*' And, finally, 38% per cent upon
the tombstone that records his
virtues.”
A slight effort of imagination pic-
tures a deceased Jawbone Neild de-
clining to repose under a 38% per
cent, tombstone, preferring to sit
up in a tree and proclaim his own
virtues.
Jawbone Neild in his laugnable character

A Bathtirst correspondent in re the local
contest there for the State seat:—
A judiciously spent £5O would have saved Young bis
Seat. His thriftiness was much commented upon. In
fact a persistent rumor was about on the day of the elec-
tion that his wife was seen cutting his hair in his own
backyard to save the barber’s sprat.
It’s on such issues that the Carruthers following
is returned !
John McTaggart pioneered the northern
part of South Australia when the region was
really wilder than is now the average of the
Northern Territory, and, notwithstanding the
alleged terrible wear and tear of climate on the
white man’s system, he has managed to work up a
highly creditable life score, having just died at
89. Perhaps his death at 89 will be set down as
another evidence that the white man can’t live in
the heated innards of Australia.
“Melb.”: Henry Taylor, journalist, has
just passed away. Having done well in country
correspondence, Syme gave him a good position
on the Age over 40 years ago. He was staff
leader during Syme’s first trip to Europe. Wil-
loughby and Somerton persuaded him to transfer
to the new Daily Telegraph, in the same posi-
tion, and that paper died and was dumped in its
little grave. Sundry meteorites followed Taylor
on the Age ere Schuler got his foot on the bottom
rung of the ladder.
Just 57 years ago, Robert Lowe, afterwards
created Viscount Sherbrooke, left Sydney for
England. He never returned, but he drew, with
methodical regularity, some house rents from
Castlereagh -street. He died 15 years ago. but
the unearned increment still went on. Now,
however, the trustees have decided to sell by
auction. The first lot is what was known as the
Gaiety Hotel, but when Archbishop Vaughan
built the Guildhall, it was known as the Guild-
hall Hotel. The other lots are seven brick
dwellings in Chinatown.

Acting-Collector of Customs Baxter, of
Sydney, is not one of those officials who loom
before the public. Compared with Wollaston
and Lockyer, the bosses of the Customs, he is a
small man. All the same, Baxter is likely to
make history. He has been selected in a nominal
sort of way as the awful example of the Federal
civil servant who wouldn’t pay his income-tax
and as nominal defendant he has raised a huge
question as to the powers and status of the High
Court. Baxter, in a quiet, nominal sort of way,
will cost thousands before he is settled. To begin
with, long R. R. Garran goes to London over his

W. 11. Wood climbs into Ministerial office
again in N.S.W. He is an exemplar of the success
which attends the man who makes himself un-
pleasant. Once upon a time Wood made himself
very unpleasant to Lvue, and Lyne gave him a
portfolio. When Bill left for Federal politics his
successor, John See, in allotting portfolios,
dropped Wood. Then Wood decided to put suc-
cess on a surer basis, and after that he was always
sour and nasty and horrible. There wasn’t in the
House a more consistently unpleasant man than
Wood. So they made him Chairman of Com-
mittees ; and now the honey of Ministerial office
is poured over him.
Arthur Morgan, President of Queensland
Legislative Council, once played the part of stern
Roman father in opposi-
tion to strong influence.
He was the just-appointed
Speaker in the Assembly
at the time, and, having
previously advocated re-
trenchment in the public
service, it was up to him.
So he called for the list
of Hansard employees
(Hansard was under him
as Speaker), and ran a
large broad pen through
the name of his son, an
energetic member of the
staff. And having re-
trenched Morgan junior,
he leaned back as one who
had done his duty, and
fixed his eye on the ceiling.
Fred Johns, of that
valuable work “Johns’s
Notable Australians,” is
going to bring out an en-
larged and up-to-date edi-
tion of his book shortly.
This time it will spread far
enough to take in notable
Maorilanders. This will
greatly enlarge the work, for Maoriland is just
crowded with notabilities.
Pensioners live long. An inquisitive
member of the British House of Commons has
just brought out the fact that several people on
the pension lists of William IY. and of George IV.
(who died in 1830) are still surviving. Also, he
dragged to light the D’Auverquerque foolishness.
One of that family saved the life of William of
Orange about 1690, and the monarch calmly pro-
mised that Great Britain should pay the family
£2OOO a year for ever. A good part of it was com-
muted for a lump of cash during the last century,
but £375 16s. still stands. Of course, the
D’Auverquerques don’t get it. One of them sold
out to a bank. But Britain still hands out £375
16s. yearly to the order of the father of all
Orangemen.
The western side of Pitt-street, Sydney,
between King and Market streets, is now almost
filled with drapery shops. Which recalls the
commencement of the drapery trade in that
locality. In the -year 1832 Mrs. Susannah Nash
is advertised as a “ dealer,” though her business
was that of a draper. She arrived, it is under-
stood, in the late ’twenties, bringing with her a
stock of pins, needles, tapes, and millinery. She
purchased a piece of ground, where E. Way and
Co. now hang out, built a shop and dwelling,
and started her primitive drapery store. In the
early ’thirties, for reasons best known to them-
selves, Mrs. Susannah Nash’s name was removed
from the signboard, and that of “William Nash,
draper,”etc., substituted. Bill Nash was a bom
gambler, but died wealthy in 1864. The pioneer
Ritt-street draperess died four years before him,
and on her tomb in the Camperdown cemetery
Bill the Gambler had the grace to inscribe : “A
better woman, wife and mdther, there never was.”
Oakes, the Paddington jeweller, Car-
ruthers’ new Minister, is not the first of the name
to figure prominently in N.S.W. George Oakes,
M.L. A for Parramatta, was a fighter in his day,
and starred in a great scene in the Macquarie-
street House. He was also the first man killed by
the big Sydney trams, known as Juggernauts to
the people of that day. The first Oakes came to
Australia to evangelise it, but the Governor
recommended him to turn to hard graft instead.
He turned policeman, and succeeded to the billet
vacated by pickpocket George Barrington.
Holman is going to have a rival

“Mrs. Larner” (Norfolk Island) writes:—
Your Norfolk Island par (B. 4/7/’O7) re bulls and bar-
risters evinces a woeful ignorance of Norfolk Island
history. The bull “ Barrister ” can’t come back here, for
he is by this time part and parcel of Norfolk Island, since
he paid the penalty of his crimes and was shot and buried
by the local constable. So much for bulls ; now for bar-
risters. The most picturesque identity on the island is
Oliver Macey Quintal, a member of the Maoriland Bar.
He practised his profession for some time in Auckland,
but returned to Norfolk Island many years ago, and now
just manages to exist by manual toil. Occasionally he
appears “ for the defendant, y’r washup ” before the local
“ beak.” Oh, yes, the Norfolker knows a barrister from a
bull.
Teddy Savral, “ the Cake-Walker,” one-
time member of a discolored vaudeville co., lately
well-known in Melbourne and Sydney as a light-
weight pugilist, has found religion, and is now
running a gospel mill at Bendigo, where the
bounding Worralls grow. The Bulletin lately
noted Teddy’s relapse into poetry, especially an
impassioned ode to Tittell Brune. But Edward
no longer writes worldly ditties; he is turning
out hymns by the yard, and has sent a bushel to a
Melbourne music warehouse for publication.
They mostly invite sinners to think of their end
in coon-song metres. Teddy’s sermon, “From
the Prize-ring to the Pulpit,” is a stirring 20
rounds with the Devil. By the way, the Rev.
Savral holds that the devil is not as black as he’s
painted—that he is, in fact, a * white man.
“ They’d never give the management of Hell over
to a coon,” says “ the Cake-Walker.” “ They’d
expect us to be glad to be stokers.”
Aery from the N.S.W. press gallery:
So W. H. Wood is absorbed in the Carruthers
Government. Wood was a Labor man in the
beginning of his career. The advocacy of Labor
measures was his sole political recommendation
to the people who visited his Delegate store in
days far back. But he played balancer when he
found himself in Parliament, and in a few years
dropped into the Government of W. ’J. Lyne.
Since then he has accepted everything good that
came his way. He had to be almost booted out
of some positions. He has pocketed a good deal
of money as Chairman of Committees, and it is
said he cherished undying hatred to the See
crowd because he didn’t get more. For a young
man—born about ’69—he can show old stagers
many points. It was he who knocked Henry
Clarke, the octogenarian, out of political business.
Still, having gone round the clock of N.S.W.
politics, making in turn something out of every
party, the future is likely to grow monotonous.
He can’t go round again, for the clock-face is
used up, and staying with one party must be very
wearying to Wood.
J. P. T. Caulfield, the one-time “Boy
Politician,” died in Melbourne last week, at the
age of 43. Caulfield was many things in his life-
time. He flitted gaily from country journalism to
hotel-brokery, pub-keeping, and the running of a
drink cure. In his journalistic days he and the late
John Farrell ran rival papers at Lithgow( N.S.W.),
and John pushed wild borak at J.P.T. in verse.
J.P.T. couldn’t write verse, so he was handi-
capped ; but he hustled for advts. in a way his
poet rival was quite incapable of, and did fairly
well. He was a Protectionist and then a Free-
trader and a Single-Taxer. He was at one time
a rather persistent and wholly unlucky candidate
for Parliament; the nameof the “Boy Politician”
killed his chances every time. He got through
much money in various States, and took his
reverses affably. A hurried, clean-shaven,
pleasant, kindly, eloquent, not-too-well-ballasted
man was Caulfield. He was always young with
a curious kind of elderly youth ; he was always
serious when other people regarded him as some-
thing of a joke; he was always sincere and
honest; and he was always ready to do a good
turn to anybody. J. P. T. Caulfield was an in-
stitution at a time when Australia didn’t take
its politics very seriously, and a whole lot of
people will regret his passing out.

Mrs. Morgan, who died last week at Ade-
laide, aged 74, was the widow of one-of S.A.’s
numerous Premiers. The State had 41
Governments in its first 47 years, so it had lots of
Premiers and Ministers, and it repeated them a
good deal—for instance, Henry Ayers was in
eleven Ministries, and still wasn’t in office so very
long. William Morgan was Chief Secretary
under Premier Boucaut for nine months, and
again for eleven months ; and then he put up
the amazing record (for S.A.) of being Premier
for three years, and again for a quarter of a year.
Then he went out to make room for a new poli-
tical generation—Bray, and A. Catt, and ex-
policeman Jenkin Coles, and others.
Last financial year (to June 30, 1907), the
Queensland railways paid working expenses and
interest and left £B4Bl over. Prior to that, it
was 22 years since they had committed such an
indiscretion as to even pay working expenses and
interest, without leaving anything at all over.
An impassioned letter, signed “Squatter,”
and filled with denunciation of the wire-netting
duty and the Sydney wire-netting industry,
appeared in Sydney Telegraph last week. It
excited a little interest among those in the know,
Chiefly because it happened to leak out which
importer composed the letter, ahd how much
itnported netting that importer has on hand,
A political sensatiofi of last week Was the
S resit of Carruthers to tear Jimmy Hogue’s
inisterial portfolio from him and inake hifii a
mere honorary Minister. Jittimy Hogue is Said
to have been the only Minister who backed tip
Carruthers in getting an Order-in-Council to
“authorise” the wire-netting seizure. And is
this to be Jimmy’s reward for being at a crisis as
much of a traitor as Joseph ?
Yic. Assembly members have been
wandering over the idle lands of the Western
district, and as the Age puts it, “Everybody
was convinced of the necessity of cutting up these
estates and settling them ; but it was considered
that Mr. Bent’s scheme would only boom prices
and make sound settlement impossible. . . . M r -
Prendergast again advocated a land-tax.” Well,
and what does the Age do? And what do the
others do—the others whoare not Mr. Prendergast?
Premier Ward, of the Dominion of Maori-
land, issued a proclamation to the people on the
day when Maoriland ceased to be a “ Colony.”
There was much good advice in the proclamation,
especially the words “Preserve the purity of your
race from every undesirable mixture.” The
Chow-haunted Dominion, which has never yet
managed to raise a White Maoriland party,
badly needs such advice. And it requires almost
as badly another streak of good counsel which
Ward didn’t give it: “ Don’t borrow.”
Willis, one of the Foreign-traders that
N. S. Wales sends to the House of Reps., dived
into his own wardrobe during the Budget debate,
and produced this :
I bought a pair of boots in Melbourne for 10s. 6d. —I
usually pay 225. 6d. —and they are the worst boots I ever
purchased.
Which is so like the anti-Australian Foreign-
trader. He “usually pays 225. fid.” for his im-
ported boots (which probably were not imported,
after all), and when ne gives 10s. fid.—less than
half—for a pair of Australian-made boots, and
finds that they do not wear so well, he points
triumphantly to the fact, and asks what further
proof is wanted of the rottenness of Australian
manufactures.
FAIR WARNING.
It would be idle to pretend that there are not many
grave and important questions pending which may be
fraught with serious consequences to your nation and
to mine. —Parting shot by Jap Consul, September 26, ’O7.
THE SOOTHASTER: “Fort are living in a false
security. You are threatened with a grave
and immediate danger.”
“Mate”: According to the papers, Mr.
Justice O’Connor objects to the extra work as
President of the Federal Arbitration Court. He
has struck because he didn’t get additional remu-
neration—that is, overtime. A few months ago
he gave what I suppose he called an equitable
award in the case of coasting mates. He said
that the payment of overtime to us would be
unwise and unworkable, and we are not allowed
to strike. Now if only an Arbitration Court con-
sisting of mates could sit and hear Mr. O’Connor’s
plea for overtime ! Part of the time for which he
wants overtime pay was the time he spent in
deciding that we didn’t need overtime pay.
The Argus, etc., are quite sure that
“ Protection increases prices.” Yet, for a year
past, it has been possible to buy bottles from 15
to 20 per cent, cheaper than you could when
Sydney was a Freetrade port. True, they were
Jap and German bottles. The Jap has been
pouring in derated water bottles in 50 gross lots.
And very soon afte' the old tariff (10 per cent.)
was put on, the price of German bottles came
down by 25 per cent, at one swoop—by way of a
hint to Australians who might think of becoming
bottle-makers that that was what the German
thought of a mean little 10 per cent, duty, and as
a warning to the would-be local manufacturer to
keep off the herbage.

THE DISAPPOINTED DEPUTY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
During the discussion on the Estimates, House of
Reps., Friday, 20 9/’O7, Bill Lyne, in response to the
500th (or thereabouts) interjection of J. Cook, deputy-
fcemporary-stopgap-Leader of the Opposition : “ I can’t
do anything right from your point of view, and I don’t
intend to try ! ”
Oh, Joseph Cook, why do you grow
So querulously petulant ?
’Tis weary, waiting (as you know)
One’s artful rivals to supplant;
That Lyne and Co. still run the show
Is vexing, one may freely grant;
But why this dismal, fretful flow
Of snaps and snarls inelegant V
Is it because, despite the blow,
You fe'e’l you haven’t Buckley’s show?
the party which you lead, I trow,
Is quite the stupidest extant!
That’s why it fails to overthrow
B. Lyne—the man of adamant !
That’s why it lets you lead, you know,
And as its spokesman oft descant !
No wonder, Joseph, that you grow
So querulously petulant 1
Though Fortune may strange gifts bestow,
I fear you haven’t Buckley’s show !

BENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Accused of talking about himself, Yic. Premier Bent
smartly responded, “Well, ain’t I something to talk
about! ”
Wherever Tommy Bent may go
Of Premier Bent he’ll ever chat;
The Premier always lets us know
What jovial Tommy Bent is at,
And what he did, and what he knew
Since far away ih ’forty-two;
We should tiot shudder when he jawg
Of Bent, formidable and stout;
be talks about himself because
There’s nothing else to talk about;
At least it’s plain he is in touch
With no one else who matters much.
’Tis well for little men to rate
The Premier on his self-esteem ;
About themselves they need not prate,
They always have another theme
Of inexhaustible extent—
The qualities of Tommy Bent !

SEMPER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 1, 1907.
My Dear Arini,—
. Miss Clara Butt came off the wearisome train
journey from Melbourne looking as fresh as
only a person with a good constitution and a
fejood complexion may look after such an ordeal.
She reminds of the girl in Wells’ story, “The
Food of the Gods.” (You know the goddess-like
young giantess who was the product of the right
kind, the godly kind, of food.) Various recep-
tions arranged in her honor are declared off, as
she desires to rest —as much as the interviewers
will let her. Kennerley Bumford, at the Cen-
tral Station reception, looked as proud of her as
if he were a peacock and she his tail. There
never was such a gorgeous pea-hen as Clara Butt.
Her secretary Ibbs was very soon lost on the
golf links. The Tait boys couldn’t ’phone round
seven miles of links for Ibbs ; and, as the melodious
giantess may be spoken to through Ibbs only, she
often escapes that tired feeling that comes of
being questioned like a catechism or a census
paper. But the Taits must feel like committing
a little giganticide and a good deal of Ibbscenity.
Daughter of Anak, Clara Butt, now at home at
“ Fairlight,” knows how to make a picture of her-
self. She sits with her back against the twilight
of the drawing-room. Every blind is lowered, for,
without, the earth splits wit!} heat. But she
faces a panel of crude light from the open door—a
rain of uncompromising sunshine. Her com-
plexion, eyes and teeth are all of the best, and
youthful at that, so she knows what she’s facing.
Her first words of greeting seem to come out of
the basement of “ Fairlight.” Never heard a bit-
tern boom in a marsh—but maybe the bittern and
Mrs. Anak boom welcome in the same key. After
a further ten words or so, the unusual profundity
goes out of her tones, or becomes unnoticeable.
Her splendid figure is in a long blue Empire gown,
and the huge pearl studs—they are huge—in her
ears couldn’t have a more artistic background
than the soft black gloom of her hair haloed
around her head. The lady’s quiverful was
“ down the garden ’’—they should have been pre-
sent, pulling the hem of mamma’s gown, and
standing up on chairs to kiss her. She talks
music, Australians in London, passion-fruit,
climate as a possible voice producer or retarder—
talks with brightness and brains, and tells how she
longs to see Australian local color in the shape of
station life, the swaggie, and the superb Biverina
boundary-rider with his horse, his dogs, and his
stockwhip.
I don’t know whether the lady herself authorises
the pronunciation, but I notice that in certain
haunts of affectation and artificial Teutonism she
is styled Clara “Boot,” to rhyme with “foot.”
Why do these things happen ? And though Clara
is English and Butt is English, the daily papers
insist on calling her “Madame.”
Talking of voices. A girl who has until last
week been cook with a Pointer family has been
snatched from the realms of the hot range and
the gas stove by music-lovers who heard her sing-
ing in the kitchen, and she is now started a*
voice-culture. Her voice is said to be a contralto
of unusual range and purity.
A golden wedding: On September 26, 1857,
Father John Eugene Gourbeillon, popularly
known as “Father John, the French Sculptor,”
united in wedlock, at old St. Mary’s, Patrick
MacMahon, second son of Patrick MacMahon, of
Cloonteen, near Six-mile Bridge, County Clare,
Ireland, to Dora MacDonough, second daughter
of Patrick MacDonough, of William-street, Lime-
rick City. The Pats and the Macs have been
successful during the half-century, as Mr. Mac-
Mahon has owned the Circular Quay Bond for 40
years. Father John sculped the figures which
still stand in the niches of that bit of old St.
Mary’s which survives.
The announcement of Mr. Kelso King’s en-
gagement knocked a luminous hole in the society
darkness or, correctly speaking, the dulness that
has endured for half a year. The girl is Miss
Alice Kirk, of Melbourne, a relative of millionaire
Walter Hall. Mr. K. K.’s first wife was an
heiress of considerable nuggets. One of his two
good-looking daughters married, recently, an
Englishman named Waring; the other youngster
still frisks on the summer lawns and swings on
the dewy cobweb before the day is aired. The
correctly-tailored widower, who has the rigidly
proper air of a High Church vestryman, carries
his fatherhood of two opulent grown-ups as
lightly as he does his blinding-bright silk hat.
One small mercy for which Society has to be
thankful: It wasn’t a widow who harpooned the
wary head of the Mercantile Mutual Insurance.
The bride-elect, Kirk, who is one of the family
of Kirk’s Horse Bazaar, will be here for the
Spring races with some of her people.
Another engagement is that of Miss Mary See,
of Grafton, to Mr. J. Adams, a brother of Dr.
Adams, of the Powerful, who married one of the
Knox girls. The bride-elect, like her cousin, Miss
Lily See, is well qualified to enter for the Beauty
contest just taken up by The Lone Hand, in
response to an English and American challenge,
and should struggle well up in the front rank of
the disturbance.
Last Saturday in a William-street tram I saw
a beautiful She who could, an she would, make a
fair bid for the contest. She was very fair—not
a chemical Flora —and she was artistically frocked
in striped black and white silk muslin with blue
facets and a brown, ruffled hat. She showed con-
siderable courtesy in the matter of passing fares.
Do you ever meet a really-truly pretty woman
who is not also pretty-mannered ?
Concerning courtesy: Sydney is getting an
ugly reputation as a champion rude place. The
majority of Maorilanders who visit us comment
on the discourtesy of office boys, the brevity of
lift attendants, and the suddenness of counter
clerks and railway people, and the hustler hust-
ling for his tram. And a day or so ago I met a
British gentlevvoman who complained that, in
passing through our Australian capitals, she was
treated as if she had come to restore stolen pro-
perty, or was suspected of being a canvasser for
an unfashionable charity. We didn’t deserve,
she asserted, our beautiful surroundings and our
glorious climate. We weren’t measured for them,
so to speak. We deserved slop suits. She
acknowledged that when she reached the
heads of departments their courtesy was
undeniable. Also she admitted that our
metropolitan policeman is a pet. For the
rest we were in such debt to good breeding that
we ought to go into Chancery and be sold. For
herself, she was going on to Maoriland, where she
had been told (I wonder if the Maoriland Intelli-
gence Department told her) that every laboring
man behaves as did Philip Sidney, Admirable
Crichton and Dan O’Connor, not to mention
Bayard and other polished examples that you
could see your face reflected in.
The Equity Court here has just disposed of a
quaint will case. Some time in the yesterday
afternoon of history, William Beard left his pro-
perty to his son Samuel with these conditions :
That he is to support my wife, his mother, as long as
she lives, and should she desire to leave him, to allow his
mother ss. per week as long as she lives ; also to support
my daughter, his sister, Sarah Ann Beard, as long as she
keeps herself quiet, but if he finds that he cannot manage
her he is to give her £lO sterling, and let her go and do
for herself.
As regards the old lady, it seems there was no
trouble; she lived till she died, and now
sleeps peacefully with her mothers in God’s
Acre. But Sarah Ann, the daughter, wouldn’t
keep quiet. Instead, she hollered at the top of
her voice; and Samuel couldn’t manage her any
more than he could drive an angry camel. In the
end the lady was taken away at the top of her
voice to the lunatic asylum, and her £lO was sent
after her, and Samuel Beard applied to the Court
for an assurance that he had fulfilled the condi-
tions of the will. He got it, and Sarah is now off
his mind.
A new musical and dramatic club, “ The
Nomads,” has arisen in Sydney, and hopes to add
to the gaiety of the nation. Mr. Percy Gray
(sweet name to whisper in the gloaming) is its
hon. sec., and it is rehearsing Audran’s “Olivette”
and a comedy.
Yesterday Mayor of Sydney Hughes formally
opened Falke’s new studios in City Bank Cham-
bers. As much of Society as could drag itself
away from its iced Yichy and milk and into its
fluffy, dog-star clothes came along to the func-
tion, and to congratulate Mr. Brooks Thornley
on the agate and jasper surroundings of the new
art centre.
The Miowera takes away from these shores
Mrs. Carreno (who has been doing Rotorua in
Maoriland), and Mrs. Tittell Brune and her Clar-
ence.
A Sydney girl who is going to an Asiatic port
to wed a naval potentate—he’s not Asiatic—has a
ripping travelling coat made by a Pitt-street firm
in her trousseau. It was created from two steamer
rugs, with the addition of a yoke of emerald green
check.
Mr. Hazon waved his baton at the Citizens’
Complimentary Concert over a serious pro-
gramme. It is a fairly serious thing to say good-
bye to the collective citizen with whom he has
been associated, and from whom he earned his
crust, for twenty years. The citizen likewise felt
that there were aloes and citrons in the meta-
phorical stirrup cup, but they did their best to
sweeten it with praise, hurrahs, flowers, and a
bank draft for some £6OO. State Ex. Rawson
said the suitable thing, put an envelope into Mr.
Hazon’s salary hook, and shook the same hook.
A group consisting of the headlights of the
Amateur Orchestral—Messrs. L. Beaton, Merri-
man, Barton, Marich, Southwell, and others—
which went on the platform with his Ex., behaved
with extreme gravity and decorum, and wore
beautiful, mirror-bright boots.
The Child Study Association picnic to the
“ Innisfallen ” Willises’ place at Middle Harbor,
on Saturday, was go great a success that all con-
cerned are seeing medals on their collective chest.
The generous Willises provided sufficient cookies
for the 400 or so that attended. It was a paying
picnic, so the funds will be somewhat inflated.
Dr. anql Mrs. Alan Carroll, Mrs. Izett, Mrs.
Coghlan, Mrs. Rosenbloom, and other honorary
workers for the charity were to the fore, and the
Newtown Brass Band and Mr. Will Bennett gave
their melody for sweet charity’s sake.
You remember my mentioning Carrie Moore’s
motor, and brougham, and dogcart? Well, they
are merely some of the gifts of her fiance, who
will soon be her financier and permanent car fare.
She marries the gentleman about the beginning
of the new year, but she will not leave the stage.
Mr. Charles Hughes, who has been assistant-
manager of the U.S.S. Co. in Sydney for some
years, will go as manager of the same co. to Tas-
mania. His successor—Mr. Cranford, a Maori-
lander —is already in Sydney.
Mr. and Mrs. James, of Newcastle, have been
taking a look at this city so as to better appreciate
that Great Commercial Centre where they abide.
He is mayor of the Lesser Smoke—a clean-shaven,
athletic-looking party minus the Usual worried
mayoral expression.
Dr. Clubbe will be back from his European
gambollings in a few weeks, yet the hollow made
by his resignation in the Prince Alfred Hospital
has not yet been padded out. Senior Assistant-
Surgeon Abbott, whose due it would seem to be,
cannot be a misfit. He has done eight years hard
—in the capacity of S.A.S., of course. At the
end of , his first term of six years, the heavily-
alphabeted Sawboneses showed their confidence
in him by electing him for another six years, two
of which have expired in great agony.
Now that the Humbert Millions are dead and
gone, a certain amount of interest begins to
centre round the Page Millions. Very curious
and shadowy and remarkable is the yarn of these
Page Millions. The estate is said to cover a
huge area of London, and the alleged value is
almost anything—£so,ooo,ooo or £100,000,000 or
£150,000,000; it even rages up to £200,000.000.
It might be wise to call the thing the Page
Billion at once, so as to allow it room to grow.
The Page family is said to have flourished and
waved its tail greatly in the land from the time
of Henry VIII. till the year 1829. Then the last-
known Paragraph of the family came to an end.
One account is that the final Page died, while
another legend says that there were two Pages,
who both disappeared. In fact the Leaf blew
away. At all events, the British Government is
said to have appointed trustees to take charge of
the estate, and then apparently it forgot
all about it for seventy years or so. The
trustees, it would seem, handed down their stiddy
job from one generation to another, like the
trustees in “The Wandering Jew,” and the
millions grew, and grew, and bloated, and swelled
visibly. Now—so the story goes on—the British
Government has thoughts of annexing the heap
unless an heir can be found, and an heir —or at
least a claimant —has turned up in the shape of
one Morris, an Englishman hanging out in Sydney.
A little company with £5OOO capital has been
formed to push his claim, though to go into a
scrimmage of that size with £5OOO seems very like
going into battle with a feather and a toothpick.
Many legal authorities think well of Morris’s
claim to the Page Millions, and presumably
there are some Millions, and there really was
a Page, and there hasn’t been passed on Morris
and his friends the biggest and wildest joke the
world has seen since Mrs. Humbert’s safe was
opened and found to contain a tram-ticket, or
something of the kind. Anyhow, the matter will
soon be cleared up. An agent is going to London,
and when he gets there he will ask a policeman
to direct him to the Page Millions, and the
officer will tell him which ’bus to take.
A writer in London Daily Mail, apropos
the awful Ghould pair, who have owned up to
murdering and hacking to pieces one of their
visitors, contends that if they are tried and sen-
tenced in Monte Carlo there is little likelihood of
anything happening to them. In support there
is quoted a local instance—recorded in the archives
of the town—and which formed the basis of one of
G. de Maupassant’s stories. There is no gaol in
Monaco, and there isn’t a public executioner in
the whole Principality. Twenty-five years ago a
murderer named Henz or Herz was convicted and
sentenced to death there. The authorities tried
to get an executioner and fixings complete from
France, but the French Government demanded
a 25,000-franc fee. Italy was next tried, but
couldn’t be beaten down below 17,000 francs. Some-
one suggested throwing the criminal into the
Mediterranean Sea, but no practical man-drowner
could be hired except at an exorbitant figure, and,
besides, the prisoner stood on his legal rights and
clamored for the guillotine or nothing. In the
end the sentence was commuted to imprisonment
for life. There being no gaol and no adjacent
State wanting to board a murderer, a room was
hired, a padlock fastened to it. and a special
gaoler appointed. After a while the gaoler drank
himself to death. It was impossible to find a
successor at anything like a reasonable
figure, and the assassin was told that in
future he’d have to take charge of himself.
He agreed, and for a time his meals
were brought to him from a hotel. Then one day
dinner was late or something, and the condemned
wretch went out and dined at the hotel. There-
after he took all his meals abroad, returning and
locking himself in his dungeon every night.
After three years of this the local administrators
made a fresh effort at retrenchment, and ap-
proaching their captive, told him he could go free;
in fact they urged him as a favor to clear out and
never return. He refused to do anything of the
sort; his point being that, owing to his unhappy
lapse into murder, it was hard for him now to get
employment elsewhere. Also, he was comfort-
able where he was. But all this was long ago.
Monaco has gone ahead financially since those
days, and sooner than see the Ghould couple, who
have given the Riviera such a deplorably bad
advt., go unscathed, the Casino itself will pro-
bably buy a guillotine and turn a waiter into an
executioner.
A while ago Frances Donnelly, a N’York
chorus lady, married a more than middle-aged
British widower, by name Ashburton, who, on
his side, compensated for all disadvantages and
disabilities, by being—(l) a peer, and (2) the
owner of 36,000 acres of arable land. This is
what the lady ladles out to a N. Y. World re-
porter re her new acquisition :
I suppose some of my acquaintances may say that I
married Lord Ashburton because he had both title and
riches. That’s far from the truth. In Ashburton I met
the man of iron will, the soldier, a famous huntsman, and
a master of men.
“ I very much fear that he is master of my will, too,”
she added with a touch of naivete : “ but no,” she con-
tinued sagely, “before he married me his family used to
say that he was like a lion, and would always have his
own way. But that’s not so now. I rule him well.
Whenever the other members of the family want any-
thing from him they come to me and ask that I be their
emissary to Lionheart.”
As against the lady’s possibly biassed view of
Lionheart it may be mentioned that, besides
having probably gout and a permanent liver
trouble, he has reached an age when people
aren’t “ famous huntsmen ” any more; also,
according to Debrett, he isn’t a soldier, and there
is no evidence on record anywhere that he masters
worth a cent. Otherwise the Ashburton dame
has limned her spouse and the state of affairs
generally with neatness and precision.
Thus “Mario,” from Brisbane :
Once more Lady Chelmsford has thrown herself into
the breach to help the Children’s Hospital. At a
meeting on Saturday morning last, all those whose
dearest wish it is to gleam softly in the full flare of Vice-
Royalty decided that a juvenile ball should be held next
month in aid of the working expenses. The hospital
management, by-the-bye, is so busy bickering over some
small detail about a piece of land on which to build its
new wards that it has quite forgotten that time is life,
and it bids fair to face the coming summer and the
regular diphtheria epidemic in the same old, insanitarv,
wooden barn. The well-equipped ward for which the
public subscribed at the fete last March, and which the said
public fully expected to see built before the summer, is
still a castle in Spain, and Spain is a long way off.
Next week the Governor departs under Captain
Verney’s chaperonage to Townsville, the place which
elects R. Philp ; but what has occurred to inspire in him
a sudden desire to depart to that Chow-haunted, Japanese-
laundered port remains shrouded in mystery.
His Grace the Very Rev. Dr. Donaldson was a sick
and fra\ ed and battered father of the church on his
return from a canoeing tour in Papua. He developed a
sharp attack of malaria in the land of our black brother.
He will now have to go slow for some time, and the mad
excitement of a Home Mission garden-partv in the
Bishopsbourne grounds has been postponed for a fort-
night.
The results of the recent hospital fSte are said to be
£7OO net, which, with the Government subsidy, brings
the institution benefits to £1750. A substantial portion
of the said £7OO was gathered in per medium of a spin-
ning jenny, which, being interpreted, means a machine
on which you spend several dozen sixpences, in the fond
delusion that you may win a miserable and decrepit half-
crown. Now, nine days late, Attorney-General Blair
states that, had he known of this proceeding, the pro-
moters would have been fried with the utmost ferocity
of the law. But the pretty girls who raked in the shekels
only laugh. They don’t take Mr. Blair seriously when he
assures them that the minimum punishment for their
offence is amputation of the head.
The coming of Blanche Arral to Brisbane has re-
opened the vexed question—Who is she? I have it
on vague and middling authority that Blanche Arral,
the unknown but brilliant exponent of dramatic
operatic art, and the great Calv 6 are one. Some
time ago that remarkable woman became mixed up
in an adventure which led to personal violence, and,
as a consequence, she found it convenient to leave
Europe for the time being. A few weeks later Blanche
Arral, the unknown, burst upon this hemisphere, and
sprang into instant favor. In the official returns of
operatic stars in Germany and France there appears
opposite Calv6’s name the entry : “ Present whereabouts
unknown.” Pictures of Calve are like the Blanche Arral
pictures in features and pose as are two peas in one pod.
And, curiously enough, Calvb and Blanche Arral claim
the same instructor.
“ Rosna ” writes from Adelaide:—
Our little live Crematorium girded up its furnaces last
week to receive the mortal remains of two enter-
prising inhabitants. The ordinary populace is still
slightly suspicious of this eminently sane and healthy
mode of disposing of one’s superfluous old bones, and
these are only about the seventh and eighth cases the
“ Creamery ” has had in its several years’ existence. One
applicant last week was Mrs. Morgan, widow of William
Morgan, who was a Premier of ours in the dark ages of ’7O
something. She was not one of the frenzied crowd who
pursue Sassiety and endeavor to put salt on the tail
of that elusive institution. She liked her ain fireside.
Also she was a quiet and unobtrusive philanthropist who
gave 2s. 6d. in secret where richer persons gave Is. and
blew 275. fid. worth of brass trumpet till the implement
was worn to rags.
Comedian Victor Gouriet, who danced himself into our
susceptible hearts with the “ Blue Moon,” met with a pain-
ful accident during the performance of “Three Little
Maids ”at the Theatre Royal. Gouriet was responding
to the second or third encore of the Dutch dance, when
the tendon of his heel snapped, and he collapsed on the
stage. The audience took it as a sign of mock fatigue,
and shrieked and applauded wildly. It continued to
shriek and applaud when someone came and helped the
cripple off, and nothing could persuade it that there was
anything actually amiss. Gouriet was taken to a private
hospital, where an operation was performed. With care
he will be able to rejoin the company for its Sydney
season, but he will have to go slow for a long time.
Opera companies have rather a habit of leaving their stars
in Adelaide hospitals. Last time it was Olive Godwin,
who had to stay here, and be mended and nailed together
after appendicitis.
I’m going to get up a petition to the Labah pahty to
have the name of Adelaide changed to Notbindoin, which
is a native word, meaning dead slow. Lady Le Hunte
has been giving a small weekly shivoo to a few of her
intimates at the Residence; but every other form of
frenzied social happening is suspended and hung up, like
a curate who has committed suicide, and the Exalted
have gone to sleep.
We have packed up our little exhibits in cotton wool
and sent them off to Melbourne town to gather in
all the prizes at the Women’s Work Exhibition. An
Adelaide girl—Miss Lucy Sholl—goes along to guard
them from the attacks of the envious multitude. After
reading the Sydney morning papers we realise that the
Melbourne people are capable of anything.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Beauty . —There is no topic interests women more
and no possession they prize more highly than beauty. It
has been so through all the ages, and while human nature
remains unaltered will still be so. Hence the Valaze
Institute established by Mile. Helena Rubinstein here in
Sydney caters to a distinct want—and caters thoroughly.
All the advances in beauty culture made by the great
Complexion Salons of Paris and Vienna are practised at
the Institute, and there is scarce a blemish that mars the
human face divine but Mile. Rubinstein has a treatment
to successfully remedy it. Red noses, double chins,
superfluous hairs, flabbiness, wrinkles, crowsfeet, are but
a few of the unlovelinesses that are permanently removed,
and even the eradication of birth marks and such like
serious blemishes are successfully treated. Ladies should
call into the Valazelnstitute when in town—even a sitting
of face massage had there will result in benefit to one’s
looks. The address is 158 Pitt Street, on the second floor.
Also at 274 Collins Street, Melbourne. Ask to see Mile.
Rubinstein herself.*
The irreconcilable party in Queensland now
musters only two members—Lesina and Hardacre.
In token of their staunch adherence to the plat-
form, these two gentlemen follow Philp regularly
into the division lobby. The rest of the party,
led by Bowman, is giving the Government loyal
support, and good progress is being made with
Kids ton’s democratic programme.
When political candidates raise the cry of
“ Measures, not Men ! ” do they ever reflect that
the main function of Government is not the mere
putting of Bills through the Parliamentary mill,
but the much more important work of administra-
tion? With a poor class of men, honest and
effective administration is impossible—even
though “ Reform ” measures be ground out at the
rate of a dozen per diem.
Another “Federal outrage” has gone
wrong, in Tasmania this time. When the Com-
merce Act was passed, a howl went up from that
Speck that the apple-export trade would be
ruined. Meetings were called, conferences of
fruitgrowers were held, and State Ministers raved.
It was wildly alleged that the thing aimed at
could not be done—that it would take armies of
inspectors, and that it was A Blow aimed specially
at Tasmania. The agitation was so far successful
that it resulted in the defeat of two good
Federalists, and very nearly led to the defeat of
Minister Keating. But now the State Minister
for Agriculture in his annual report says :
The “Commerce Act” was primarily for the protection
of genuine traders, against those who misrepresent the
quality of their goods. By enforcing this probity in busi-
ness, it has become a guarantee to the consumers of
receiving wares true to name and value. It is to be
regretted that it became necessary to enact such legisla-
tion. At first it was considered that it would unduly
harass and damage the industry, but I am glad to say
that the growers, exporters, and shippers have become
quite reconciled to this new legislation.
Then the report goes on to mention that the thing
that couldn’t be done, even though armies of
inspectors were employed, was effectively done by
four men “without any delay whatever to the
boats.” But not one of the fools who declared
that this beneficent legislation spelled ruin has
the grace to apologise to Deakin, Lyne and Co.,
the men who knew so much more than he did,
and admit that he was a coarse, ignorant cater-
pillar throwing dirt at Solomon.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 30, 1907.
My Dear Yarrie,—
There was a gap—a huge vacuum in the atmo-
sphere—after the express whirled the radiant
Clara Butt away from Melbourne on Friday.
The Large Lady almost missed the train.
A manager or two, and a worried secretary,
and a pianist or so fussed about ner-
vously. Clara sailed into view—large, serene
and smiling—at the last moment, and placidly
boarded the car. She was suited in leather-
bound pepper-and-salt, and wore a verdant
green hat like somebody’s lawn. A diminutive,
grev-elad maid followed with a huge purple dress-
ing-case, and husband Bertie flanked the proces-
sion with a worried look. Then the hungry crowd
rushed the windows and grabbed scraps of lilac
from the Adored One’s bouquet. They had a
few minutes’ chance, as a stand-up fight was
delaying the train. Some common or garden man
had jumped into a carriage reserved for the higher
court Judges, and he refused to vacate his cosy
corner or leave his wooden hut on wheels for any
old porter. It was a lively train; the Inter-
national College football boys were returning
Sydney-ward with much hurrah, and the re-
mainder of the club was bursting itself with noise
on the platform.
At the last Butt concert here the Northcote
Dame, with Secretary Share in attendance, front-
rowed (please pronounce that carefully). Mrs.
Deakin and clever, pretty daughter Stella, 8.5.,
accompanied the Governor Lady.
Steele, of Pianola fame, had rather a good ex-
perience lately. Melba had ordered a piano and
the attached animal to be sent up to “ Ercildoun,”
the country nook where she vegetates when she
doesn’t break loose and fly headlong to Melbourne
to escape from the vegetation ; and he had
journeyed with the order. At “Ercildoun” he
was playing and putting on musical frills and
testing the piano, when Melba broke in threaten-
ingly with “If you go on playing I shall sing ! ”
Steele naturally went on, and Silver Throat sang
and sang, till all the birds —the magpies, and
wag-tails, and blackbirds, and kookaburras, and
the tame emu, and the ostrich, and the hen
(which had leaped off the hot egg to listen), and
the turkey-gobbler—collected in the garden, and
gaped with open beak, and clawed up nearly an
acre of lawn in their excitement and applause.
She sang herself into a glory-gay mood, and a
little later, discovering a horse hanging up to the
rail, she jumped aboard (astride, and dressed any
old house-way) and went tearing off round the
paddocks at full gallop—like the old-time bush
girl Nellie Mitchell. Well, anyhow, that’s the
story. It is also said that the bill for the repair
of the lawn where the birds were applauding is no
less than £22 10s.
The sociable schemes of a wildly artistic coterie
are in process of materialisation, and promise
some excitement. A periodical feed at a popular
pension, followed by vituperative argument, and
“ etching-bath ” (a local synonym for Australian
wine) is a preliminary programme. Petticoats
are promised admission on certain formidable
conditions. One is that they show a:proper re-
spect for their intellectual betters, and don’t dare
to even breath loudly, while six eloquent youths,
with disorganised ideas and hair, exhaustingly
argue the inexhaustible question : “ Did Christi-
anity deal out a dirty left to High Art ? ” Any
misguided female who dares to sneeze during
this section of the entertainment will be
firmly ruled out. Personal paragraphists of
the same sex are promised special attention.
All round mutual improvement is premedi-
tated ; but probably that altruistic intention
won’t survive the first two meetings. Men and
minds are a safe enough mixture, but when a
generous leavening of Cat is included, it’s guaran-
teed to explode with a huge, hurtful detonation
before very long.
The suit for damages, on account of a broken
heart and disappointed ambition, threatened by a
local frock-concocter against a medicine man has, I
hear, been abandoned. Which will be sad news
for the gossips. The injured lady, it is said,
found that her chief certainty in the affair was a
virulent battle. Also, she saw the shadow of
Costs —no bigger than a lawyer’s hand at first—on
the horizon. So, like a wise woman, she thought
better of it.
Prime Minister Deakin’s reappearance in the
House of Reps, made quite a gala hour. All were
pleased to see him, and obviously he enjoyed their
pleasure. A trifle fleshier, with bright clear eyes
and a veneer of sunburn, he looks more fit than at
any time since his return from England. Mrs.
Deakin also made a momentary appearance, look-
ing more like the sister of her own daughter than
ever.
Never do I see the Reps, without finding new
points of interest in our prize politicians. Last
time their skulls preoccupied me. There isn’t a
dozen men in the whole Chamber with quite
normal brain-cases. Perhaps the vanity of states-
manship produces the skulls; perhaps the skulls
produce politicians. Dear knows ! but certainly
those astounding bumps would deny most of our
Representatives any success as beauty actors. On
Wednesday everyone was animated and argument-
ative, and only Speaker Holder was immobile
amongst the gibbering crowd. Sitting silent and
still, in his great carved chair, he suggested
Death watching a circus, or the Sphinx consider-
ing a worm in Egypt. And when he called
“Order!” his command completed the illusion.
It sounded like the opening sentence of court pro-
ceedings instituted by Eternity.
Director Houghton, of Gordon House —which
is a huge structure devoted to our impecunious
brethren—quaintly illustrates the refining in-
fluence of Bridge. Inspecting the cardroom of
his institution, he heard a gentle artisan, who
played the vulgar game of draw-poker, demand
blankily, “ Three cards ! ” Passing on, he
came upon another group which was in the mazes
of Bridge. The traditions of that regal gamble,
or else its subtle atmosphere, had got them down.
Would yer be good ’nuff to show us what’s
trumps?” asked one gentleman who, when he
works at all, hawks oysters. “Thank yer ! Your
bloomin’ lead ! ” Evidently Bridge is potent as a
manner-maker among men.
Already batches of bachelor girls make out
their summer plans of campaign.' For the most
part they re directed towards gay sea-fringes,
where the maids will pitch elaborate camps, and
play wood-nymphs and water-naiads to their
heart’s content. Last year camp results were
more than satisfactory. Hardly a bachelor bunch
of either sex went through the season without
one member or more getting lost in that scrub
called matrimony. It takes an honest misan-
thrope to ignore the appeal of a plump brunette
in a scarlet bathing gown, or the allurement of a
tame siren with auburn hair, who looks like Circe
while she rinses out the tea-billv.
Then there are the nocturnal fishing expeditions
(which may produce three four-ounce flat-heads).
When a pair in a boat row down a roadway of
moonshine into deep water, and hold hands for
hours, while crabs steal the bait, one may reason-
ably expect an engagement. I think it’s because
girls are more unaffected and primitive when
they’re half-naked in the sea, than when they’re
insufficiently clothed in a ball-room.
Dame Forrest nowadays figures as a patroness
of the arts. Beside being kind to the obscure
aspirant, she entertains the famous. On Friday,
she lunched a small party at which Melba, Mrs.
Butt and her amiable spouse, Miss Elbert-Orton,
and Julius Superbus ate their grub sandwiched
’twixt mere sassiety folk. The astute lady realises
that to keep up her social end, a hostess must
have as much enterprise as an entrepreneur, and
a good deal more generosity.
An amateur composer, Cyril Brinkley, and an
amateur co. put up an original comic opera on
Thursday. A large, lazy audience listened to it,
and the ushers applauded. Tom Bent was
there in gorgeous pumps (I believe he censured
French feet to draw attention to his own, which
are rather small and very neat). Also he had an
attack of toothache and a pale niece with him.
The opera was really creditable to its very young
composer. But the performers were sufficiently
awful to make Mozart an infliction. The singing
lovers were the only melodious items in the whole
capering cast.
Mrs. Humphrey Weinholt and her hubby sail
round town under the experienced wing of pa
Purves, K.C., prior to disappearing over the
furthest horizon of North Queensland. The lady,
who dazzled as Miss Mary Purves, shines still
more brightly as a matron.
More comedy is being played by a popular
company than its mighty audiences see. The two
pretty creatures who lend their charms to the
current drama are as fond of each other as a cat
and a canary. One is ingenue, other is experienced,
so their tactics show a nice dissimilarity of
method. So far, their scores are about level. The
chief chimera of contention is, “ Which of us is
leading lady ? ”
The big O’Hara medico and another golf en-
thusiast were practising hard at Fisherman’s
Bend. “I’ll play you for all I have in my
pocket,’'said the sporty doctor. “ Done !” said
the other, and the doctor lost. Then the medico
ventured his case and cleeks, and lost again.
“Play you for my hat,” wagered the big im-
petuous Irishman. The doctor went up to town
bareheaded. He didn’t stake his clothes and
boots.
Miss Eloise Juno’s complimentary concert was
not as successful as it should have been. Indeed,
benefits seldom are these days. But, neverthe-
less, the popular lady scored to some extent.
Sensible folk advise the abolition of public enter-
tainments for testimonial purposes. The expenses
are heavy, and when they are paid little remains
for the grateful beneficiary. In Herr Otto
Linden’s case subscriptions will be received by
Hjalmar Josephi and flautist Weston-Pett, and
that venerable favorite’s testimonial will not be
penalised by a single unnecessary expense.
An Englishwoman, of charitable designs,
thought out a good scheme the other day. The
village church wanted a new roof, or the rector
wanted a new Sunday frill—or some other worthy
object had to be served. She issued tickets.
A Grand Concert,

You bought a ticket, and that ended the matter.
You didn’t have to go and have your feelings
harrowed by amateur musicians.
Miss Corona Patterson was wedded to her
man-o’-warsman on Wednesday, with much pic-
turesque detail. The charming centre-piece was
draped in ivory satin and striped gauze, and
wore a Brussels veil, whereof the value and
beauty advertised the fact that it was lent by a
grandam. Her attendant ornaments were her
sister Hazel and Miss Ida Elder in Wedgewood
blue-and-white frocks of much grace. The lieu-
tenant enjoyed the moral support of two gold-
braided sailor-men. The wedded pair afterwards
held a reception at Menzies’ Hotel, before flitting
to Sydney. Papa Harvey Patterson presented a
box of table silver, and Mrs. F. M. Dickenson was
original enough to give the doves an entirely de-
sirable rug, really and truly Persian, same as the
cat you meet occasionally.
The “ Sandow Girls,” who wave rather sparse
arms at visitors to “ The Dairy Maids,” excite the
scorn and derision of genuine disciples of physical
culture. These brawny persons say that the
stage Sandow girl isn’t a bit true to the ideals of
the real girl—the one who lets her big sister stand
on her muscular Little Mary for the sake of
amusement. The stage version is too luscious
about the body curves, and her arms aren’t suf-
ficiently symmetrical (a proper Sandow arm is as
nicely modulated as a villanelle by Wilde). Her
beauteous buzzom isn’t high enough, also it is too
ample. Altogether, the Dairy-Made sample is too
“female”, instead of being like unto a he-angel
in his most modern nightgown. Be it understood
that this criticism of the stage lady emanates from
a skirted athlete. The waistcoated ones don’t
criticise —they content themselves with just ad-
miring and breathing heavily.
The Shirley Fisher maiden (erstwhile of Ade-
laide, and given to many butterfly flittings to
Melbourne and Sydney), who picked out a big
silver-fish in the matrimonial market and
departed with him to the Motheaten Land, has
been the envied of visiting girl-chums, because of
her petted life, her swagger house in Park Lane,
and all the taken-for-granted attendant glories.
Now word comes that the lady has suddenly
taken to chorus-work (in “The Belle of New
York ”) in a London theatre.
“Tryphena,” from Pans :
It’s a barren and deserted Fogtown just now. There
are pinnies on the Chippendale chairs and bandages on
the vases, and a sense of desolation over Mayfair. A
domestic or two, and Jacques in a greasy old suit with the
sleep ever in his eyes, remain to keep the house in its
place, and the moth and the rust and the Bill Sikes from
destructive entrance. At night all Park Lane lifts the
white faces of its houses to a grey starless sky, and as one
drives along there’s an impression of a ghostly legion lan-
guishing in the dull, apathetic August atmosphere. Just
here and there a small flicker of light from a tall window
tells of habitation—of Mary Ann reading of a young
Duke who wedded a vaudeviller. Only at the cafbs is
there Life—and it is life in moderation. The seductive
music steals over the strings, and amorous couples drop
their cutlery and clasp hands, and the butter congeals in
cold sulks on the cooling artichoke. It’s the giddy sec-
tion of the populace that helps to pay the gas and band
bill at the cafes in August. No fashionable dare be seen
hanging superfluous on the Big' Smoke stage after the
middle of July. The Smart World spreads itself at Spa,
at Marienbad (where the King has been stared into
anger), at Carlsbad, at Aix-les-Bains; or it frolics
wickedly at Ostend—sparkling, devilish, expensive Os-
tend. Nearer the hub, at Brighton and Margate, the
saucy' trippers do the Grand Stroll on the Promenades.
The Jew is in prominence (it seems no Christian Britisher
has any cash to spare on the summer sirens), and
he’s such a healthy-looking, beautifully-groomed pro-
duct. He doesn’t over-dress or over-flash. There s
nothing aggressive about his clothes, whatever his manner
maybe. For the London Jew is cultured, and guards
himself jealously from ridicule or criticism—as jealously
as his ancient conceit will let him. So he talks cleverly,
is informing, interesting, and good-humored. Only does
his colossal assurance, as he. struts with Mamie, the
beautiful, strike the onlooker. These handsome young
Hoggenheimers are not rude —they’re rich.
Down at these show places, as in the Big Smoke, the
Hatless Club multiplies and increases every hour. At
first sight, I imagined all London had rushed out of its
office and was dashing to post an urgent letter.
Subsequently I found no letters were being hastily
hurled into the post-pillars, and that the hatless legion
was bent on ordinary business through the Strand.
Sometimes the naked-headed carried a gamp and even a
pair of gloves, and the hatted Londoner was too insensible
to grin. Even a class of feminine leaves her thatch un-
toqued, and she’s even sillier-looking than the unbatted
male, for the rest of her is burdened by clothes—bur-
dened, oppressed, lumbered. It isn’t an attractive type
of She who pursues the hatless craze. It’s mostly the
schoolmarm—the toiling spinster, whose greying hair-
pinned thatch looks unlovely in the drab atmosphere of
Piccadilly these August days.
Fashion, on the other hand, concentrates its edicts and
all recent mandates on the millinery subject. Stylish
Womanhood was never so well catered for in regard to
top-gear. The frock is a mere trifle. The hat is Every-
thing. It is a work of art in the first place to consider
its fore and aft parts. One takes it from its prettily rib-
boned box and sits down in deep, earnest cogitation.
How was it put on at Madame Fluff’s? That is the
question. Very likely, after several hours’ rehearsal, one
goes forth with it skewered at the wrong angle. This
fact learned, one drives furiously to Fluff’s for an abiding 1
lesson in the art of the hat’s lodgment. The secret of it
all is Hair. Your own abundant locks will not suffice, no
matter how profuse. No wonder the women of Fogtown
build up the edifice before breakfast and preserve it till
bedtime. Such a hair and hat building is too great a
labor to be demolished in a few hours or to be erected
hastily. ~ ~ , ~,
They call Paris in August dead. Dead 1 I landed at
night, when the day’s toil of France had ceased, and
night—the Paris night—had commenced. It wasn’t so
much a noisy Paris as a luminous one. The newer
motors spin silently. The vehicles have their bells, but,
after the Big-Smoke hansoms’ ting-a-linging eternally,
that is nothing. The vivacious Parisians were strolling
in teams along the lovely Boulevards, down the green
avenues, and along the gay Champs Elysbes. They
strolled arm in arm, greatly absorbed, and their voices
were only a small part of the quiet city hum—that hum
which is peculiar to every great metropolis. But the
glory of the lights ! They flashed along the boulevards or
they glowed steadily in their glass top-coats in lines and
"roups before the giddy caffis chantants. “ Paris is
dead ” says the valet in apology to Monsieur. “ Paris is
dead ” explains the chambermaid to Madame. “ And the
Americans can’t keep it alive ” grins the Englishman.
They' have possession of the hotels, but they can get no
<rrip for all their rain of dollars on the city. Jonathan
stands isolated in a Paris throng. He is lost. He can’t
understand how completely he is out of the picture.
His raucous voice and nasal twang prevail in the reading
and dining rooms of his hotel; but in the caf6 chantant,
the crowded Louvre, the Tuilleries, the Palaces of Exposi-
tion, away in lovely Versailles, he is overawed by the
sparkling Parisians, and mopes about, bored by his own
unfitness. , , . .. . TT ,
The Englishman, on the other hand, is at home here. He s
slv and he knows his way about. He dines with Clotilde,
and is content to let her twitter and chirp and peck and
dazzle him. She does it all so beautifully. Her voice is
thin high, sweet. She laughs up and down the soprano
scale’s. Her eyes dance over young John Bull. They
tease and please alternately. Sometimes she presses her
pretty, clever, ornamental, little hand on his, and he
fervently hopes no one is looking, and that she’ll do it
ao-ain. -It’s a tender little action that Clotilde invari-
ably helps on dinner with. Her scarlet lips pout and
pucker as she talks, or they spread back from the loveliest
teeth that daughter of Eve ever nibbled apple with. Her
face is oval, clear, smooth as satin, colorless as ivory.
Her hair is lifted back from her temples in an ocean roller
manner of crimp. She wears no fringe. Her forehead is
part of her beauty. It has no learned bulges. It’saspretty
as her ears, and they are sweet sea-shell fringes. She is
powdered, brow-pencilled, massaged, coifled and doesn’t
look as if she knows what any of these ridiculous things
mean. The charm of Clotilde is her absolute (apparent)
unconsciousness of the care expended on her toilette.
Her vivacity is as ceaseless as the electric fan Young
John Bull understands just sufficient French to enjoy
Clotilde’s nonsense, and sufficient aesthetics to appreciate
all the exquisite details of her wonderful get-up. He sits
sipping his liqueur, looking at his temptation with a lot
of judgment and a little smoke in his eyes. Clotilde
whiffs her weed in his face prettily, and he sits and gloats,
quietly contemplating, at her charming and occasionally
wicked antics.
All the beautiful, misty little snatches of Aus-
tralian bush atmosphere that were in Johnny
Ford Paterson’s picture show have melted away
to lucky Melbournites for little more than a song.
Paterson priced them far too low'. Professor
Spencer has shown his never-erring eye, and has
annexed the brightest gems of the collection. The
Prof, is lucky in the possession of that wonderful
bush twilight scene.
Mrs. Yorke Syme, of the Florid Frocks, had
her “ Tournemount ” mansion packed with guests
on Thursday afternoon. Mrs. Deputy Chapman
was among f*he guests, and the visiting Tasmanian
Douglas Lady and her daughter. It was an
elaborate afternoon tea, and there was some sing-
ing that was well worth listening to.
Rita Kiddle, the maid of sheepy wealth, packs
her Saratogas for India next week. Smart chiffon
stores have been fixing up the most fascinating of
frills and frocks for the traveller.
Melbourne photographers are agog over The
Lone Hand Beauty Quest. For one, Mr.
Brewster, of La Fayette studios, has made special
arrangements to attract the fair to his studio, and
I hear others are following in his track. It will
be a great score for the photographer whose
client’s pictured countenance goes round the
world as that of the typical Australian beauty.
J. C. and Mrs. Williamson have left London

Miss Clara Clifton, who was mentioned in
a recent “Melbourne Chatter ” as having got tired
of hotel life and set up housekeeping on her own
account, writes in indignant denial, and wants
the statement contradicted “to save further
trouble.” The Bulletin has walked long and
earnestly round the statement, and has viewed it
from every possible point, and it can’t see where
the trouble could possibly come in, unless it is
libellous for a lady to possess her own furniture
and crockery ; but the statement is withdrawn in
any case. Miss Clifton doesn’t cook her own chop
in her own domicile. She hangs out at the Old
White Hart, Melbourne.
The Bent Government lately showed its
high appreciation of the value of a scientific
training. It advertised for fruit-inspectors to
investigate possibly-diseased bananas, etc., at the
wharves. They were to have a good knowledge of
insect pests and fungoid diseases, and they were
offered casual employment —a ( few hours whenever
a Sydney or Brisbane boat arrived—at Is. per
hour. The department was surprised, too, when
it got no applications. Now, if the same Govern-
ment wanted a lawyer to see if anything was
wrong with a proposed agreement, it wouldn’t
dream of paying him less than £2 2s. an hour, and
it might have to pay £lO 10s. But the scientific
expert hasn’t banded himself into a close corpora-
tion, and isn’t supposed to need the stimulus of
filthy lucre. He is expected to be well enough
rewarded by being given the chance to find a new
bug.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Rockhampton (Q.) raised an anti-tariff
meeting the other day. A retired importer occu-
pied the chair. An importer moved that the
meeting strongly disapproved of the tariff. A
shopkeeper seconded. The retired importer in
the chair refused to allow any hostile discussion.
Then about 40 out of the 68 peoDle present voted
against the resolution, but the retired importer in
the chair declared it carried, and refused to listen
to any protests. After that the very small meet-
ing closed with a very big slam, and the bogus
results were sent out.
Boulder (W.A.) has had a great and en-
thusiastic meeting to protest against the tariff
[vide the Perth Foreign-trade papers). Some
storekeepers and other dealers organised it, and
nearly ran the boots off their feet beating up re-
cruits for a long distance around. The result was
that, in a district where there are some 5000
Federal voters, an audience of less than 100 was
gathered together, and of these 42 voted to con-
demn the tariff, and 25 voted that there was
nothing wrong with the tariff. And an attempt
to work up a secession meeting struck an even
colder snag than that.
COW AND BULL.
Tommy Bent declares that John Bull alone is
capable of saying what sort of Governors Aus-
tralia should have. Tommy has stated that he

he prefers bowing to the other fellow.

And doubtless William -M‘Linen’s firm is pre-
pared to assure the public, even though it is
driven to the use of Australian-made goods, that
the quality is as high and the price as low as ever.
It may even do as it did when the first Federal
tariff came along, and state that the prices will be
lower than ever.
The Newfoundland Constitution has been
suspended so that the Mother Country can hand
the infant s interests orer to the tender mercies
o the United States. A possible British suspen-
sion of the future is the Australian Constitution,
so that Japanese immigrants may enter free
unless Australia sets to work now to make such a
move emphatically not worth while. And the
way to do that is to build up a population, and an
army, and a navy that will enable us to say to
liull in a loud bull-voice : “ Our armed assistance
-,v s t 0 y° u as that of the Jap.
Which will you have ? ”
Three columns of jubilation in Sydney
Telegraph, September 26, announced the
crushing humiliation ” of the Australian Go-
vernment. What it amounted to was that
Joe Cook, with all the swiftness of a small
ioy chucking a lump of mud when nobody
!? J °Sr nscore d a snap division against
mu , Government by a majority of two.
1 he decision was promptly reversed, and the only
result of the incident was that some hours were
wasted, and the Telegraph was able to air its
atrocious French (un mouton cn rage is its version
ot a gibe that every schoolboy should be able to
spell). These be but poor fruits of a “ great
victory.”
There seemed no possible hope of unseating
Labor Senator O’Loghlin if those S. Australian
voting papers had remained burned. And—well
this is a North Queensland yarn. In 1883, Jack
Hamilton, Fred Cooper, and Tom Campbell were
candidates. All was plain sailing for Tom until
the return for California Gully came in, which
gave a vote of 185 each for Jack Hamilton and
Cooper-and five for Campbell. This placed
Jack at the head of the poll, with Cooper a few
votes behind, but nearly 100 ahead of Campbell.
However, the Gully vote smelt so of fish that an
appeal was made to the Elections and Qualifica-
tions Committee, when it was alleged that the
Gully could not poll over twenty votes; in fact,
the only butcher within forty miles said he merely
killed half-a-bullock a month, or thereabouts.
1 hereupon Cooper was fired out, and the second
seat was given to Campbell. But that didn’t
settle the matter. Promptly thev made Camp-
bell insolvent, and then he had to go out. They
put a lot of energy into their politics in Queens-
land 25 years ago.
As soon as Philp was beaten at the Queens-
land polls, the Brisbane papers got purple in the
nice, so hard did they work to bring: about a
coalition between Kidston and Philp. Then
when Kidston said he wasn’t walking into that
parlor, and with Labor help dished both Philp
and the papers, the latter screamed that Queens-
land s credit was gone, and that the wharves were
piled feet high with departing capital. The
Courter got down to details, and knew of a capi-
talist who had withdrawn £87,469 11s. 1.0 d., or
some such sum—name and address, however, not
mentioned, and no reference permitted to a
banker. Since that screech these two things have
happened
(1) The same Courier has reported that vast improve-
ments are contemplated to properties around the
wharves, one lot alone running to £lOO,OOO.
„ C) The same papers have announced that Kidston has
refused offers of large sums tendered as loans on better
terms than were obtained in 1903.”
For all that, the papers haven’t had the honesty
to admit that they invented the furious rush of
departing capital, and the Courier has made no
swallo .w th® Fatman it created, or the
£87,469 11s. lOd. it endowed him with.
If N.S.W. Premier Carruthers makes good
his contention that the Ma State is entitled to
import goods for sale free of dutv, there is a
dazzling time ahead for the Customs
agent. And why not? The land agent
has had his turn; and the Customs
agent will soon learn to whisper to the
big importers : “Hand over the cash
and say nothing, and 3 r our shipments
will be Jet in free as State imports.”
Even if the importer of shoddy had to
give the agent Is. an acre, same as
the improvement lease person, it would
pay him splendidly.
N.S. W. Auditor-General’s report
for 1907 has something to say about
the way the mostly Anti-Sosh farmer
has scorned to be beholden to the State
by pajbng iip for the seed wheat issued
to him during bad seasons. The N.S.W.
Government began to distribute seed
wheat on tick in 1889, and, up to 1903,
£127,018 worth of the article was given
out. The farmer’s sturdy scorn of State
assistance is shown by the fact that,
after a run of splendid seasons, June,
1907, found him still owing £37.596.
Also the Department has written off
£7991 as the'baddest kind of a debt.
The Auditor-General urges law proceedings, but
the Agricultural Department is “ averse to strong
measures.”
S. J. Mitchell has an amending Northern
Territory Mining Bill on the stocks of the S.
Aus. Assembly. It is aimed at the abominable
system by which Europeans take ud leases nomi-
nally for themselves, but really for Asiatics, from
whom they exact blood-money. Almost every
European of note up in the N.T. has at some
time or other adopted this caper to improve his
income without exertion, to the detriment of
white workers. Hence the passive—almost
active—resistance in certain “influential” N.T
quarters to the White Australia policy. Hence
also some bricks will be thrown at Mitchell for
daring to interfere with what they have the gall
to call their vested interests. But as White Aus-
tralia will be put a few steps nearer if his Bill
passes, Mitchell, who is a good Australian, will
probably put up with a brick or two;
Marvellous are the tangles the Foreign-
trade rags get into these days. Brisbane Courier
was. loudest of the Brisbane dailies in its prolonged
moan rc the big duty on imported chairs ; and its
sympathy for the unhappy Australian worker,
doomed to stand up for life as a result thereof,
was touching to a degree. That the aforesaid
worker should ever be able to make a chair for
himself was scouted, with a sob of regret, as one
of the utterly hopeless things of this life. Mean-
while the Observer (which is the Courier in its
evening state, only rather more so) was running a
series of articles headed “Amateur Carpentry for
Boys,” showing how bookcases, garden seats,
tables, dolls’ houses, and the like may be made by
the veriest nipper, and at a cost so'infinitesimal
as to return said nipper a good profit. To the
Protectionist mind, the argument that while an
Australian adult can’t make a kitchen chair if he
bursts for it, the same adult’s youngest kid
can do the job with ease, will appear involved
and a shade'unconvineing ; but to the Freetrader
(especially the Brisbane breed of him) the thing
is quite clear and reasonable.
Not “ JUST AS GOOD.”—Don’t be led
astray by taking something else when calling for
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. It is pleasant to
take, safe and sure. Always cures.*
JAW.—THE LAST OBSTRUCTION IN THE WAY.
The announcement that Premier Car-
ruthers will take the new portfolio of Agriculture
in the N.S.W. Ministry, while in the shuffle the
old Chief Secretary s Department is to he wiped
has shaken up the N.S.W. Public Set vice.
The Chief Secretary’s office hirelings are worried
about their billets, and the rush to apply for the
job of Inspector of Turnips in the new Depart-
ment is something terrible.
The Corowa (N.S.W.) Crown Lands Agent
got a shock on September 25, when seven blocks
of land, totalling a few thousand acres, were
thrown open for conditional purchase. When
the tired man put up the shutters he found he had
received £B5OO, being deposits from 471 applicants,
every one of whom wanted a block, and yet
N.S.W. is advertising for immigrants to come
out and go on the land. This is the sort of thing
that should gain 471 solid votes for a graduated
land-tax.
N.S.W. Government Gazette has per-
formed the obsequies of a long-dead township.
Silverton was a hunky young place once upon a
time, and in 1886 it became a municipality, and
installed its council with great pomp and beer
and circumstance. Then the silver lodes petered
out, and the populace shouldered the unmarried
lady called Matilda and left for fresh fields, and
the council didn’t meet any more because there
wasn t anything to meet for ; besides the council
was dead, or had left, and there wasn’t anybody
among the ruins to elect a new council, or any
reason why there should he; and the council
chamber became the abode of starving rats, and
the ghosts of the “ good old days” gibbered for-
lornly o nights through the broken, cobwebby
windows. The new Local Government Act gives
the Governor power to bury dead municipalities,
and last week Silverton was duly gazetted as
being no more. It goes to join the mayor of
Tyre, and the aldermen of Sidon, and the person
who inspected nuisances in Ecbatana, and the
dog-tax official at Palmyra.
“ T. A.W.” writes :
In the S. M. Herald of the 24th inst,, Mr. Killmrn Scott
has something more to say regarding the Fifield (N.S.W.)
magnesite deposits—apparently in answer to my remarks
published in The Bulletin of the 19th, re the original
article in the Herald on this subject. All I need say in
reply is to point out that Mr. Scott’s observations in no
way affect the points raised by me—indeed be is himself
forced to admit the truth of my statement that fire-bricks
have bean made in this State for years. In the article to
which 1 took exception Mr. Scott is reported to have said
that “ there is now no reason why Australia should not
be able to produce her own furnace bricks, instead
of having to import them,” and that “it will be
a good thing for Australia if she can produce her
own fire-bricks and furnace linings.” The natural
and obvious inference to be drawn by the reader
unacquainted with the subject from these remarks
is that Australia does not now produce any fire-bricks or
furnace linings, and it was that inference which it was
my aim to combat. Had Mr. Scott said that Australia
at present produced no magnesite firebricks or mag-
nesite furnace linings, and that it will be a good thing for
her if she can produce this particular kind of brick and
lining, no exception could have been taken to his state-
ments, hut his remarks as they stood gave a totally
wrong impression, and I am pleased to have been able to
induce Mr. Scott to publicly qualify them in the wav he
has done. ‘
Sydney Telegraph last week allowed
Senator Neild nearly a column in which to rehash
an old American joke about the man who rose
from his 33 per cent, bed, and looked at the 30 per
cent, clock, and then washed in a 38-i- per cent,
wash-basin, with 27 h per cent, soap, and so on
ad infinitum. There were 300 or 400 such items
in the laborious joke, and it was all based on the
theory that Australia will never make anything,
and will for ever import and pay duty on every-
thing. Neild even propounded the idea that
Australia must import its butter, eggs, sugar,
bacon, bread and salt, and wailed about the duty
on them. So far as this writer knows, the labored
witticism was first devised to help Cleveland and
his partialiy Freetrade following into office in the
U.S., but it may really date back to Canute.
Anyhow Neild made a very poor rehash of it.
Sinclair, one of the Reps, whose election
was hailed as a great victory for Anti-Sosh,
moved the adjournment of the House, last week,
to denounce the squeezing of the butter industry
by Private Enterprise in the shape of the Shipping
Combine. Briefly, Sinclair’s grievance was that
the Combine recently raised butter freights to
London to 2s. 6d. per box. Some butter pro-
ducers, including Sinclair, then fixed up an agree-
ment with theFederal-Houlder-Shirelineat Is. lOd.
a box. It was antic’pated that the F.H.S. would
not be ready to carryall the butter offering for
the next few months, so that some of Sinclair’s
friends would have to ship butter by the Combine.
To meet this difficulty a fund was started to
recoup these shippers the difference between
Is. 10d. and 2s. Gd. The Combine, however, has
calmly announced that any friend of Sinclair’s
party who wants to ship by its lines will be charged
not 2s. Gd., but 3s. 2d. This move scattered Sin-
clair's Anti-Sosh theories to the winds, and hearose
to beg the Government, when completing the mail
contract, to put in some stringent socialistic
clauses dealing with this kind of Private Enter-
prise. Lyne hinted that perhaps a State-owned
line of steamers would be the only solution, and
Sinclair was understood to welcome the idea, and
to be ready to go the whole socialistic hog. .He is
prepared to go all the hog there is and then to
cry out for more hog to go, even as Alexander the
Great, when he had gone the entire hog in Persia,
wept because hog had run out.
ON THE TARIFF RAMPARTS.
HRID: “ Watchman! What of the night?"
COOK: “ The outlook is black and drear.”
“ Aimee ” writes :
The boss at my pub opened a ease of sauce last week,
and was much pleased on account of the big reduction in
price shown on the invoic ■. Drawing forth a bottle, he
took the wrapper off. Then the smile vanished, and
gave place to a yell of rage. “Damned Sydney stuff!”
he said wildly. The case was promptly returned. I
don’t know whether the sauce is any good or not;
neither does my publican. But as he told me afterwards,
“ Everyone knows we can’t make sauce in this country,”
The Maoriland farm hand is beginning
to kick like the fat person Jeshurun. Met in
solemn conclave at Ashburton the other day, he
demanded legislation to compel the haughty
cockatoo to supply separate sleeping accommoda-
tion for each employee and a fireplace at which
the bucolic toiler can dry his clothing on wet
nights. The Maoriland Tory press admits that
the demand is eminently reasonable, but suggests
that it be rejected because the “ hands” might be
inflated by their victory', and ask for more. The
Tory does not believe in doing justice though the
heavens fall. He has a firm belief that if justice
were done the heavens would fall on him twice
a week, and he doesn’t think he could stand the
shock!
A SAD CASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Argus correspondent draws attention, in pathetic
terms, to the fact that the new tariff will practically stop
the importation of British biscuits and lollies.
Go, pull down the blinds, my brother,
And leave him alone in his grief;
I’m one that can feel for another,
For his tears may bring- him relief.
For what have we done to this stranger,
Who, motherless, bides on our shore?
Who cares if his life be in danger?
Were our people so callous of yore ?
There’s a sob in his throat ; he is eating
A biscuit from over the foam ;
Soon he and Grim Want will be meeting—
And what will they call us at “ Home ” ?
The biscuits of Aulsebrook or Swallow
Lie heavy as lead on his chest.
See how he stands, empty and hollow !
And notice the folds in his vest!
For Cadbury’s choc’lates he’s craving,
And what will we do for his pain ?
MacRobertson’s name sets him raving—
“ Imported ” is burnt on his brain.
Ah, leave him ; for deep is his sorrow ;
Do not mock at his agonised shriek.
He perhaps may improve by to-morrow,
Or at least by the end of the week.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Last Saturday’s Hawkesbury meeting drew a
crowd, and provided fields that seemed to indicate that
the ancient glory is on a return journey. Christian
Moses had a poor, inferior sort of time till a sudden turn
up in the very last race relieved the situation somewhat.
The success of Fez (Bst. 101 b.) in the Stewards’ Mile, and
Virtu (9st. 51b.) in the Flying Handicap, caused a rush on
each for the Epsom, in which their weights are 7st. 101 b.
and fist. 121 b respectively.
* » * *
The most discussed gee-gee in Australia at the
present moment is Collarit. A popular fancy for the
Epsom for months, he probably carries more public
money than any other horse in the race. Crick has been
making remarks that cause punters to shiver, and he
cynically announces that, of all the money the horse
carries, not one penny belongs to him. One reason why
Collarit was so rushed was the report that Crick had said
at one of his election meetings that unless Collarit won
the Epsom he was a broken gamester. Now it seems he
never made the statement. Also, he hasn’t trusted all
his fortunes on Collafit’s back ; in fact, he hasn’t cared to
deposit even a penny on that moving surface. The most
disquieting feature of the business is the cheerful wil-
lingness of Christian Ikey to lay 100 to two against.
Meanwhile, there are a lot of anxious punters rushing
round trying to unload. Others are holding on, in the
belief that Patrick William will come with a rush, and
prove his faith in the animal by raking in all the money
possible at the long price. Meanwhile there has been a
rush to get on Collarit for the Metrop., and now it seems
that there also Crick hasn’t a penny on. The horse may
win the Metrop., or some subsequent long race, but,
reckoning or. past performances, anything over a mile is
beyond him.
* * * *
Why lolaire should be a strong favorite for the
Epsom is beyond human ken. So far he has only shown
one fast gallop over seven furlongs at Randwick, and that
was nothing remarkable. Perhaps there’s danger of
overdoing it, or it may be that he wants careful nursing.
Imported Antonio’s manner of winning at Rosehill on
Saturday week compels earnest consideration, even though
there was nothing classy behind him, as he did what there
was to be done like a thorough racehorse. Lord Beau-
champ, Luciana, Kyeadgerie, Virtu, and others will have
heaps of deserved support, but this scribe’s fancy leans to
Legation’s chance. Nothing better has been seen in
public than the way Legation gathered in Tatt’s Tramway
Handicap of six furlongs, beating Melodrama easily, and
finishing as -if a mile would have suited him better. An
outsider that is worth having a saver on is Lady Tren-
chant, on her performances at Canterbury and Moorefield.
She carried Bst. 61b. in the Moorefield event, and will carry
Ist. 131 b. less in the Epsom.
* « * *
Reasoned out as well as such things can be, the
Metropolitan looks a good thing for Mooltan. On paper,
his track and public form, combined with the fact that
he carries only 6st. 131 b., gives him a pull over all others,
but as the race will not be decided on paper, it is quite
possible that this certainty may be upset, as others have
been, and the deed may be done by Garehes or the Maori-
lander, Maranui. Although Maranui’s public perform-
ance was disappointing, his track showing is brilliant,
and it is more than possible that he may go to the front
at the start and stay there till the winning-post bolts
past him.
* * * *
Continued defections from A. J.C. Derby seem
likely to knock to pieces the prophecy that the starters
will number double figures. Of those who are almost
certain to be left in, Mountain King looks easily the best,
in spite of the fact that a slight tendency to “roar”
indicates breathing trouble. Were the distance a mile,
or a mile and a quarter, Mountain King would be a fairly
sure thing ; but, as it isn’t, it is just possible that Peru,
a stayer of the first order, may knock him out.
The common report that Mooltan will not figure
in the Epsom Handicap and the Caulfield Cup, owing to
his owner having backed him heavily for the Metropolitan
and the Melbourne Cup, is a sad circumstance. On paper
there is no reason w r hy he shouldn’t have scooped Epsom
Metrop., Caulfield and Melbourne Cups. His weights are
7st. 21b., 6st. 131 b., 7st. 51b. and 7st. lib. respectively, and
the penalties and dates would not have spoiled his chances
unduly if his training gallops are anything to go by.
Poseidon got through a tougher task last year.
* * * *
Mahutonga, the brilliant Auckland Cup winner
of three years ago, joins Oarruthers in retirement. He
has broken down finally, and been withdrawn from
Caulfield and Melbourne Cups engagements. The horse
suffered with a game leg after coming from Maoriland
last year, and a long spell was granted him. He seemed
to recover, .but trainer Frank McGrath has pronounced
the case hopeless.
* * * *
An officer of the A.J.C. with a taste for
statistics has discovered that last season, under the
auspices of his own club alone, 379 clubs held 572 meetings
which occupied 689 days, and they distributed prize
money to the extent of £106,497 12s. This isn’t a sport—
it’s an industry, and a very useless one.

Two pars in Sydney Telegraph (24/9/’O7)
“ The sporting clubs were very lively yesterday, conse-
quent upon the general settlement of bets associated
with the Rosehill Racing Club’s spring meeting. It was
a winning meeting for the members of the ring generally,
but losing backers were prompt in their attendance, and,
as usual, the bulk of the business was arranged at midday. ”
“Rather unexpectedly the betting market yesterday
was particularly quiet, and backers of horses were either
afraid or unwilling to declare themselves In the
Epsom Handicap lolaire tops the quotations at a short
figure, while double the rate of odds is offering against the
next most fancied candidates, Collarit, Lord Beauchamp,
Legation, and Pompous. Forge is the next-best favorite’
succeeded by Lady Florence, who is some points shorter
than Antonio, Barrenjoey (backed for a few hundreds)
Jute, Kyeadgerie, Melodrama, Banzai, Mooltan, Virtu
and Thackeray. Mooltan is still a red-hot fancy for The
Metropolitan, followed some points away by Garehes,
but Legation is a little weaker, having retired to the
company of Apologue, Camera, Florance, lolaire, Lord
Fitzroy, Proceed, Peru, and Maranui. Collarit, from
being a member of the outside division, has firmed some
points. A two Cups double that was liberally befriended
yesterday was that of Zinskie and Mountain King.”
As such betting clubs are allowed to thrive, the bottom
has plainly dropped out of Wade’s Gaming Act. If it
hasn’t dropped out, and the Act is still operative, why
don’t the Sydney police raid the premises where this
gambling is persistently practised ? Does the “greased
hand” protrude? There is something smellful in this
gambling curse.
Adelaide football season finished with plentiful
excitement. The nominal Final was won by Norwood
from Port Adelaide, before a crowd of 20,000, although
15,000 were at the Show close by, with another big-
gathering at a race-meeting. Port had a right to
challenge, as having been premiers on the season’s play.
When the two teams met again, S.A.’s record for a
football match was established, and it now stands at
25,000. Norwood won again, more easily than before.
The pace was warm, so was the weather, and at
three-quarter time Norden, the umpire specially im-
ported from Melbourne, collapsed, and had to be carried
from the field.
* • * *
The Australian form of football certainly does
advance some claim to be regarded as the national game
It is the only division of the game that thinks continen-
tally. Rugby and British Association are all parochial
affairs, and their premierships and champion clubs are
unknown outside their own territorial divisions. But in
the Australian game there is an Australian champion-
ship. This year, the decisive match was played at Ade-
laide, where the Norwood (S.A.)club beat Carlton (the Vic-
torian champion club) by 90 points to 58. Till half-time
the game was dead level, but in the third quarter Nor-
wood came away with the speed of the wild ass and the
cunning of the serpent, so that Carlton was left far
behind. The Victorian crowd rallied gamely in the final
quarter, and set out to make up the leeway. But it was
a hopeless task, and time ran out before much impres-
sion had been made, leaving Norwood champion of the
continent.
•■* * ♦
The absence of any counter-attraction —the
League season being finished—sent a few' extra thousands
to the small East Melbourne ground, where the Vic.
Association final was to be settled by Williamstown and
West Melbourne, on Saturday. The turnstiles were
stated to have passed 24,000, for about £4OO ; allowing
for club members, etc., there must have been close on
30,000 in the packed ground, and, as far as the spectators
were concerned, they had as much chance of settling any
differences as have the sardines in the little tins. The
play was a fine exposition of first-class football.
Though ’Town held the lead throughout, it was mainly
by reason of the straight kicking of its forwards, and
West wired in all through, especially in the last
quarter, with such vim that a little better luck
or straighter shooting would have given it the game. At
lemon time the scores were ’Town, 39 ; West, 21. In
the next 25 minutes West got eight decent chances to
score, but could raise, the two flags only once. ’Towm
had but three shots at the posts, but managed to send
the leather through twice—gaining the Association pen-
nant, the glory, gate, billets, boots, sea-baths and all the
rest of it by seven goals 10 behinds to three goals 16
behinds. This is the first time in its existence that
Williamstown has achieved the top rung of the ladder ; in
fact, it is the first time it has got its name on the
“ placed ” list since the days when the 13 big clubs used
all to play together. Then, in ’BB, it managed to get
third to South and Geelong. The surprise was so great
that it took ’Towm 19 years to get over it.
A smaller crowd, on the same ground three
days before, witnessed a fiercer and wilder struggle
when the North Melbourne Locos and the Smith-street
Trades battled for the Wednesday Association Premier-
ship. The umpire, a well-known League player, under-
stands the game, but he is not possessed of the well-
balanced intellect, firm eye, and eagle hand, or whatever
it is that makes the ideal umpire. Consequently
though there was no legal assault and battery, or at-
tempt at riot, or fracture of King Ned’s peace, the game
speedily became a mere episode in which every man did
as it seemed meet to him to do. The teams were evenly
matched, and though the Locos managed to gain a lead of
eight points by three-quarter time, they dared not endanger
that slight advantage by playing for more, so they steadily
booted the ball to or over the boundary line. As the
umpire failed to penalise these capers, the Smith-streeters
got annoyed, and slung the rules to the winds likewise
Crowding on the ball, they forced it along by main
strength, and scored a goal. The Locos worked it
steadily round the wing, and notched two behinds. Then
a Smithie conceived a brilliant idea. Grabbing the ball
he started towards the enemy’s goal in Rugby fashion’
never attempting to bounce the sphere at all. There
were yells and appeals all round the ground
but the umpire was considering the weather, and the
Smithie sped on, preparing to kick. He had got within
10yds. of the posts when a Loco back snatched him
round the neck and slung him to the soil. He made a
desperate kick as he fell, but by that time his neck was
too awry for his aim to be straight, and only a behind re-
sulted. Then the bell rang, and the Locos shook hands
with their barrackers over their three point victory—3.s
to 3.2. The “ game” was a joyous episode, but, as foot-
ball, it was as great a farce as Bob Philp’s finance.
“ Melb.” : Australian football was started here
in 1858, by Tommy Wills, the cricketer, who had played
the game at Rugby'. He consulted with H. C. A. Harrison
the champion runner, W. J. Hammersley and J. B.’
Thompson. These two combined journalism and cricket.
The three drew up a set of rules, thus inventing the
Australian game.

For a fine, fast game of football, played in a
manly spirit, commend us to the Sydney Soccer
crowd. The match between Broadmeadow and Pyrmont
for the Gardiner Cup, on Saturday afternoon, was a fine
struggle, and one of the best athletic exhibitions writer
has ever gazed upon. It started fast, and grew faster
still in the second half, while during the extension of 20
minutes which was tacked on to the usual time to give
one or other the chance to slay, it was faster than ever.
Although the game ended in a scoreless draw, the honors
were with Broadmeadow, and the Pyrmont men—the
Premiers, the Mighty Ones who had‘suffered only one
defeat during the season—were all but outclassed. A
tendency to overcrowd and something like over-tagerness
among the forwards of the country team, were all that
saved Pyrmont from defeat. The country backs, on the
other hand, were perfect, and played a pretty game
indeed. It was a great match, and some splendid things
were done in the ruck and around the goals, where
Spencer, of Pyrmont, distinguished himself greatly.
Elgey, of Broadmeadow, was also very good, but, owing
to the slight superiority of his team, had not as many
chances of displaying his skill as the Pyrmont goal-
keeper. The teams will meet again at the same ground
next Saturday to struggle to a finish.

The news that Sydney artist and amateur bike
rider, J. Salvana, had started on his third attempt to
lower E. A. Pearson’s 75hr. smin. Melbourne to Sydney
cycle road record aroused no enthusiasm and very little
interest. People declined to take Salvana seriously,
bracketing him with the bunyip and other intangible
things. The season of the year was against success—
short days and long, cold, moonless nights. Pear-
son’s record dated back nine years, and the 572 miles of
track misnamed a road has been getting steadily worse
ever since. On Saturday, however, the community was
electrified by the news that Salvana had arrived at Picton
about two hours inside record time, riding strongly, and
that he hoped to be in Sydney by 2.30 p.m. But the hilly
nature of the last section broke him up somewhat, and
he did not arrive till 3.31. Even then he was 1 hour
34min. better than Pearson’s time. Hitherto a practi-
cally unknown rider, he now takes his place among the
giants.
The Dunlop people struck bad roads for the
Warrnambool to Melbourne race, but notwithstanding
the sloppy state of going, T. Larcombe beat all records bv
traversing the 165 miles in 7hr. 40min. 10sec., which is
2min. 50sec. inside Jack Arnst’s time for the same run.
The race was won by B. Dobie, of Victoria, starting
from the 42min. mark. He was followed by A. H.
Oakes, one of the one-armed riders. Oakes would
undoubtedly have won had his pedal not come unscrewed.
The thirdman was also a Victorian, J. H. Willis. Larcombe
punctured badly, and to avoid delay a passing cyclist
gave him his wheel. Whether this constitutes a breach
of the rules as to changing machines it will be for the
League of Wheelmen to say. No outside pacing was
allowed, but officials reported that Dobie had the benefit
of two motor cyclists part of the way, and the matter
will be investigated. The starters numbered 235, and
the majority of them made very good time indeed, in
spite of the wet going. '

Just before noon last Saturday something like
80 motor cars, carrying over 300 people, descended on the
quiet recesses of National Park, 18 miles from Sydney,
Hn fl d r e d he th o ° o «if g of „ h . orrls echoed between the hills and
P® 4, wallabies that gather round nightly to
eat Mclntosh s sugar. Having fallen on a specially-
prepaied luncheon, the motorists went out and gazed
upon the gable-like hill the cars were to climb

the 22 that remaned in started. It was a great sight.

Three sailing clubs held races on Saturday last
on Port Jackson, and one on Botany Bay, the light
easterly breeze making ideal conditions. The St. George
Club s opening was marked by the first appearance of the
new boat St. George, which was sailed by the veteran,
”• and just managed to beat Our Own,
steered by T. Cuneo, who is also a past master.
The wrestling champion of Westralia has been
an unknown individual for a long time, but on Septern-
ber. lb pcorge Dinnie and Bert Woods met at Her
Majesty s Theatre, Perth, to clothe the question with
some finality. The only result has been to leave things
more complicated than before. Dinnie stripped at 14st.,
and Woods at 13st. Woods began operations with grace-
ful hypnotic waving of the hands in front of Dinnie’s
complexion. Dinnie filled in time curling his moustache
and thinking matters over regardless of the requests of
the audience to “ bog inter it! ” Then a thought burst
upon Dinnie, and, wildly embracing Woods round the
legs, he brought him bump on to the mat. Woods
bridged, and Dinnie, getting a crutch hold, forced him
ott the mat, and deposited him among the footlights.
Woods balanced himself for a few seconds on an
e J e ° tric , Ijght globe, and then rolled into the front
stalls with great energy. There followed an ani-
mated discussion sustained by the referee two
judges, and a number of people who had backed
one or other of the men. The position was complicated,
and took 45 minutes hard arguing to work out. The
throw was declared a foul, and Woods thereupon claimed
a fall. But the rules read that “if a man be unable to
continue the match the other side wins.” And that is
the troubie. The,referee declared Dinnie the winner on
that clause, and retired amidst yells, remarking that he
would leave the bush lawyers to thresh out the finer
pouits. Backers of Dinnie are trying vainly to collect the
spoof, but the other side declare that when the man
was unable to continue as the result of a foul the man
guilty of the foul cannot win, and sternly declare that
they will see the other fellows in Sheol before they part a
stiver. J F

Hayward, Hirst and Lilley, the pot-hunting
English cricketers, who sniffed at the M.C.O.’s offer of
£3OO each for an Australian tour, and demanded £lOO
more (and in the end got nothing), have had some
straight talk fired at them by their own friends, in-
cluding P. F. Warner, captain of the last English team
that came in. Here actually are the terms offered
(1) £3OO to be paid as remuneration, £25 thereof to be
paid before leaving England, £175 during the tour, and
the balance upon return to England; (2) sea passage
(first class) and 30s. a week when on board ship to cover
charges for wines, spirits, tobacco and other expenses •
(3) hotel expenses in Australia, and 40s. per week to
cover charges for wine, spirits, tobacco, cab fares and
other expenses ; (4) railway' fares and travelling expenses
in Australia, including luncheons and drinks ; (5) washing
bills up to a reasonable amount; (6) the usual gratuities
for servants. A man who wants more than that shouldn’t
be a cricketer. He’s greedy enough to be an importer.

Cricket opened with a grand flourish in Sydney
last Saturday. The batsmen smote to kill, the often
alleged “back-number” Syd Gregory smiting 219
to his own cheek, while Macartney ran up to
144, and Jansen battered 99 on the scoring board.
Gregory’s exhibition was worth watching: he
swiped six sixes, three of them off successive balls
and backed them up with 30 hits that cleaned up
for a return of four each. The ball that brought
disaster was delivered before he was ready, and
Gregory stepped back thinking it was a meteorite that
had dropped from somewhere. However, as he did not
appeal, it counted. On the other hand, the trundlers
were not obliterated. Down at Manly, Fisher, of North
Sydney, knocked down five of Middle Harbor’s stumps
for a paltry 24, and his performance was just about
equalled by that of Connolly, of Central Cumber-
land, who took seven of Southern District’s tim-
ber stacks for 36. North Sydney has already
beaten Middle Harbor, which finished up with
106 runs. North Sydney went in and compiled 130 for
the loss of six wickets, and practically closed the argu-
ment. Petersham, the baby club, tackled Sydney Dis-
trict, and lost eight wickets for 280, which was mighty
good. Waverley made 359 against Redfern for the loss of
six wickets. Balmain made 248 against Paddington.
Gordon scored 304 for nine wickets against Burwood.
University dismissed Glebe for 195, and made 42 without
losing a wicket.

A team of Fijian native cricketers is said to be
on its way to Australia. With whom they are toplay has
not been announced, and the cricket authorities in
Sydney are as dumb as oysters on the subject. Cricket
is, according to McLeod, just about dead; but the
presence of a black team from Fiji on the Sydney Cricket
Ground would indicate that it has become piebald,
which is worse than being dead. The next thing will be
a “ clicket” team of Chows from Singapore.

Cricketer W. S. Duff (Australian rep. R. A.
Duff’s brother) has been shaking things up already this
season with the bat, and compiled 94 and 100
not out in two matches for Callan Park. Folkard (of
the same team) also piled up a mammoth 203 the other
day. There is a deal of merit in such scores thus early in
the season.

Something like an event was decided in Maori-
land recently, when two athletes—Kelly and Wakeman—
decided to settle a difference by a 53 miles walking
match from Marton to Taihape, for a stake of £5O. They
left Marton at 5 a.m., and after a vigorous set-to for 47
miles (to Utiku), Wakeman threw it up, leaving Kelly to
reach Taihape at 4.25 p. m. The 53 miles were covered
in 11£ hours—a very respectable performance over Maori-
land’s rugged country.

“ Dick ” Arnst is the most disgusted athlete in
Australasia at present. Although the Maorilander has
only won a couple of handicap sculling events, none of
the alleged first-class Australians will give him a match ;
and Arnst has therefore put up the necessary deposit to
row the winner of the Webb-Tresidder championship
struggle. Arnst, too, has a wild hankering for another
smack at cycling, and (providing there are any big prizes
about) will have a hand at scooping them in during the
coming season.

Squib : An ex-champion amateur pug
moralises. “There is nothing in the ’onor and glory

success your efforts are rewarded with a piece of gold and
enamel worth at the outside fifty bob. At first yer dead

jolts just ter knock yer into shape. He puts a finishing

it aimcult to obtain a sparring partner—make a chopping
block of yer enthusiastic phizog. As the competitions
are drawing close you must look after wind and
weight, so you indulge in long walks wrapped in half a
dozen sweaters and several yards of blanket, finishing
with a Turkish or ’ot sea-bath. Then diet, no rich
puddins, pastry or greasy meat—you’d do better in gaol.
Passing the pastry shop you sigh for a tart or
cream puff, but the championship is always
looming. It envelopes you, working, walking, eating ; it’s
always before you, and asleep you dream of ‘biff, biff.’
After months of training and self-denial, you enter, and
are accepted by a white-shirted committee at a kind of
court-martial as to whether you’re a brewer, a beef-
eater, or your great-grandfather a lag. At last the night
arrives. It s your first appearance in public. The hall’s
crowded. You recognise no one, not even your second.
AH is a confused mass, as you sit in the corner and smile
a sickly smile at t’other feller in the opposite one. The
referee treats you like a father. ‘ Now, boys, don’t’old
and it. Shake hands. Box on.’ Assuming a ferocious
expression,.you make for t’other fellow, who glares in
similar fashion. At first your attitude is just the thing,
and you spar and exhibit natty footwork. Then you stop
a solid straight left with your face, and the contest ends
in three wild and awful rounds. Science is thrown to the
wmds. ‘ He’it me ; I’ll’ave a bit of ’im’—so you mostly bog
in. 1 other feller’s phiz appears gigantic, and at intervals
you view stars and comets. Then wild cheers—you don’t
know what for. A gent in a boiled shirt declares you
winner, and you retire more or less resembling a Yarra
suicide. Several similar contests, and you qualify for the
final. At this stage you enter the ring the worse for
wear, but less excited. Then you’re at it, t’other chap
landing some heavy clouts, but you wait and watch for
an opening. At last he over-reaches, and you send in
your best right swing. It seems to bury right into his jaw.
He hits the floor with a thud like a side of mutton.
You want to jump on him, but the referee sends
corner while the ten seconds are counted.
The boiled-shirt feller declares you champion. You exit
like a piece of chewed string. T’other chap goes away
feet first. You are champion with a fifty-bob medal. The
outed chap is quite silly for days, and requires a spell on
the kerbstone on his way to toil. His preparation cost
him nigh a tenner, and he gets a junk of silver worth
fully ten bob.” The moraliser isn’t taking any more biff
or medals. “ I look on now—say I can’t get the weight,
or something.”
France, which has more motors to the square
yard than any other country, begins to complain that the
noisy, smelly automobile destroys fine manners. The
motor-hog becomes abruti, coarser and louder with every

who, having been confectioner in grand families, knows

. Another alleged automatic tyre puncture healer
is about to be put on the market. It is the invention of
a couple of young Maorilanders named Rogers and Myers.
From the eulogistic references in the Maoriland press the
scribes over there are apparently under the misapprehen-
sion that this is the first and only tyre-healer ever in-
vented. Which idea is far from correct. Several have
been invented, and some of these are already on the
market. Still, there is plenty of room for another.
The Sydney firm of Osborn and Jerdan has
just completed the longest, best, and most expensive
cinematograph film ever produced in the Common wealth.
It was done for G. MacMahon, who took a full com-
pany into the bush and travelled over miles of
country to get the suitable locations and specta-
cular surroundings to illustrate “Robbery Under
Arms." Churches, gaols, racecourses and waterfalls
have all been commandeered and worked into the
film, that was made throughout at 393 George-street.
This is a bright beginning of what may yet prove
to be a great industry. Hit herto our films have all been
imported, except those taken to illustrate a few football
matches, and this is the first attempt to work up a com-
plete novel in pictures. There are a lot of good Austra-
lian yarns that would lend themselves to illustration in
the same manner, and the taste ought to be an increasing

CONSTIPATION.
Constipation is like stuffing up the sewers of
the city, and keeping all the filth in them till they
are filled with poison and corruption, breeding
disease and pestilence. When the bowels are
clogged the waste matter decays and ferments,
and enters the blood, and is carried to all parts of
the body, producing headaches, biliousness,
sleeplessness, heartburn, loss of appetite, indi-
gestion, neuralgia, rheumatism, and various other
ailments, disturbing the heart and nervous system,
and, if continued, is liable to cause inflammation
of the bowels, liver and kidneys. To maintain a
healthy system the bowels should operate at least
once every 24 hours. This is one of Nature’s pro-
visions which is too often ignored, and the result
is untold suffering. Women are the greatest
offenders, but sooner or later they must pay the
penalty. Many women’s ailments are due to the
straining and purging, following upon habitual
constipation, and in many cases displacement of
the pelvic organs may be attributed to the same
cause. Constipation caused through neglect iri
course of time becomes chronic, and the use of
drastic purgatives not only weakens the intestines,
but by the habitual use of such medicine the
bowels refuse to act naturally. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Hoot Pills are a perfect remedy. They
act upon the liver, and stimulate the secretion of
bile, and assist the bowels in a perfectly natural
manner to throw off the waste matter from the
system. They do not weaken, sicken, or gripe,
nor parch the bowels —like salts (which thin the
blood) and many other remedies which only
aggravate the trouble —but restore them to their
normal condition, and, being purely vegetable,
may be taken with perfect safety by the most
delicate woman or the youngest child.*

A MINISTER’S TESTIMONY.
REV. HENRY GAINFORD, OF THE HIND-
MARSH SQUARE CONGREGATIONAL IN-
STITUTIONAL CHURCH, ADELAIDE,
writes:—“The Earoscope you sent me has
wrought a marvellous change in my hearing.
The change is indeed so pronounced that I feel
it my duty, even at this stage, to recommend
it to anyone suffering from deafness, in what-
ever stage it may be.”
A NURSE’S TESTIMONY.
THE WELL - KNOWN AND HIGHLY-
ESTEEMED NURSE STUART, OF G 2
BONDI ROAD, WAVERLEY, writes“ I
am happy to tell you that after 15 years
of suffering- I am now completely cured
from the distressing head noises, and my
hearing is as good as ever it was. I hope
that all unfortunate victims will he fortunate
enough to hear of your wonderful discovery.”
Dr. P. J. SMITH, 8.A., M A C., writes
“1 cheerfully endorse the ‘EAROSCOPE’ as a specific treatment for Deafness,
Head-noises, or Ringing in he Ears.”
THOS. M’NEVIN, Esq. (a retired squatter in his 70th year) from Glebe Point,
N.S.W. (formerly from Melbourne), writes: —
“ My hearing is improving from day to day, and I also find my memory much better.
CURED AFTER ALL OTHER TREATMENTS FAILED.
The Earoscope Co., Pitt Street. 138 Burton Street, Darling-hurst, loth April, 1907.
Sirs, —I received your kind letter inquiring as to the progress of my treatment with your Earoscope, ana
lam very pleased to report to you with most satisfactory results, for I FEEL HAPPY to GET RID ofthe
NOISES anti to ENJOY GOOD HEARING AGAIN. As explained to you at the time when I bought the Baro-
scope, that I have tried Ear Drums and many other treatments. None of them did me any good, and several
doctors who treated me for some time gave me up after years of treatment, and it was only at the induce-
ment of my friend that I bought the Earoscope, which is certainly a wonderful treatment. I never expected
to be cured, and it was indeed a happy surprise to me after so many years of suffering. I thank you heartily
for the good you have done me, as you have made a new man of me entirely.
Very truly yours, (Sgd.) DAVID LINDSAY.
If you are afflicted with Deafness, Head Noises, Ringing in the Ears, Discharging Ears, or
any other Aural Complication, and desire a complete and permanent cure, write to the
EAROSCOPE INSTITUTE (DEPT. 26), 90 PITT STREET, SYDNEY,
N.S.W., for the “ EAROSCOPE REVIEW,” fully describing an entirely new self-
applied method, which will be sent to you GrRATIS on mentioning this paper.
Do not be disheartened because your Doctor pronounced you incurable, and do not give up
in despair because the many so-called Treatments have failed to do you any good. The
successful cures accomplished in some of the most obstinate cases of 30 and 40 years’ standing
are sufficient evidence of the efficacy of this Treatment, even in cases which had resisted all
other Treatments, and been considered incurable.

DUNLOP ROAD RACE.
Australasian Road Championship for 1907
Won by T. LARCOMBE (N.S.W.) off scratch on
DUNLOP TYRES
In World’s Record Time of 7hrs. 40mins. lOsecs.
Larcombe’s performance ranks as the finest achievement yet accom-
plished on the road in this or any other part of the world. Out of 235
starters, 157 used Dunlops, which conveys an idea of the great
popularity of these speedy and reliable tyres.
“Tax-Gatherer,” from Melbourne :—
The Federal civil servants of this State have, by appeals
tb Oourts of Petty Sessions, Supreme Courts, High
Courts, and Privy Councils, pretty well managed to
evade payment of State income-tax up to the present,
but it is alleged that a good number of the officials in the
State Income-Tax office have done the same in a much
simpler way, and without any costly law trouble.
Towards the end of the year, when most people have paid
up, two or three clerks are set to work to make out a
register of all those who have not. This they do faith-
fully, so far, without fear or favor. From this register
are made out what are called “ sue ” or summon notices,
but it would be only human nature if the clerks forgot to
summon themselves. The notices go through various
departments, and so many things happen to them that
by the time everybody has finished buzzing round the
heap of documents there is hardly a summons left for
anybody in the office. About twelve months ago an
Income-Tax clerk was “ sacked,” and they were so intent
on “doing him bad” that they forgot to look up the
books and find out whether he had paid his tax or not.
Inquiry the other day showed that he hadn’t, and he is
lik lv to be in Woolloomooloo or Japan by now. Further,
he may have taken with him, in case of trouble, a list of
the other fellows who haven’t paid, so perhaps he is best
left alone.
The Newcastle (N.S.W.) Labor League,
which objected to an increase in the Australian
Parliamentary allowance on the ground that if a
Labor member “ could not live on £400 a year, it
showed that he had lost touch with his class,’
missed the target completely. The Parliamentary
allowance at £400 a year didn’t leave £200 a
year as the wage of the member who drew it
when necessary expenses were deducted (often
it left just about £150 a year), and it kept a
man much too closely in touch with the pauper
class.
“ Oby ” writes: —
The value of the alleged protection which Britain will
afford Australia if war happens along can only be ascer-
tained when the time of trial comes. No occasion has yet
occurred when more than talk was called for. Next door
to Australia, however, is a State (Maonland) that was
once driven into a war enterprise. At a critical juncture
of the Maori war application was made to Britain for
military assistance. It was refused. Later on, after
further appeals, a small force was sent on condition that
Maoriland paid all expenses of men and furnishings.

HE foundation of the busi-
ness of Huddart Parker
& Company Proprietary
Limited dates back to the
year 1853, when the late
Mr. T. J. Parker arrived
f in Geelong, representing the firm of J. & D.
Parker, warehousemen, of London. He erected
there an iron store, which he had brought out
from England, and commenced business as an
importer. Towards the close of the following year
he became more directly connected with the shipping
interest as agent for the steamer Express, which
had recently arrived from England, of which
Captain William Smith, who was in command,
was joint owner with Mr. S. B. Skinner, the
engineer. The late Captain Thomas, Webb, for
a long time associated with Mr. T. J. Parker
and Mr. John Traill, joined the Express as chief
officer when she entered the Geelong and Mel-
bourne trade. Mr. Traill, who is now Chairman of
Directors of Huddart, Parker and Co., joined Mr.
Parker early in 1855 as manager of the ‘‘Express”
steamer agency.. Some years afterwards the late
Captain William Howard Smith, preparatory to
entering the inter-State trade with the You Yangs,
sold his share in the Express to Mr. Parker, who took
up his residence in Melbourne, assuming the agency
there, Mr. Traill remaining in sole charge at Geelong.
Captain Webb then took charge of the Express, Mr.
Skinner, now joint owner with Mr. Parker, being the
engineer. Mr. Skinner died in 1867, and Mr. Traill
and Captain Webb became joint owners bv the pur-
chase of his interest. In 1869 the Express was super-
seded by the Despatch, the latter steamer having been
built in Scotland under the supervision of Mr.
Parker. The Alert and Excelsior were in succession
built for the same trade, the former in 1877 and the
latter in 1882, and with the Excelsior’s arrival com-
menced the bi-daily sendee in the Geelong and
Melbourne trade, now carried on by the Courier and
Excelsior.
This brings the history of the Company to a time
when it is necessary to go back again and review
another branch of the business, in which the
late Peter Huddart was successful in establishing
the coal trade between New South Wales and
m
Geelong. Captain Huddart, who came to
the colony about 1854-55, was in the early
’6o’s joined by his nephew, Mr. .James
Huddart, who established a business at
Ballarat, and after-
wards took up the
importation of
coal and export
of produce at
Geelong. In the
year 1876 Mr.
Huddart
joined
Messrs.
Parker,
Traill and
Webb,
forming
the well-
known
firm of
Huddart,
Parker and
Co., who
were then coal importers and merchants at Geelong,
each partner having an equal interest, Mr. Huddart
being appointed manager. The ships owned by the
firm at this stage were the barques Olivia Davies,
Medea, and Queen Emma. In the following year
the firm purchased the coal-importing business of Mr.
Morley, in Melbourne, and with the business took
over the barques Frederica and Sparrow Hawk.
Mr. Huddart was appointed manager in Mel-
bourne, and Mr. Traill, in addition to the
management of the steamboat business at
Geelong, took charge of the coal-importing
trade at that port. The coal business at both ports
having already increased, it was resolved in 1880 to
employ steam instead of sailing vessels in the trade,
and the steamers Nemesis, Lindus, and Wendouree
were procured in rapid succession, the presence of
Mr. T. .T. Parker in England at the time enabling
the firm to build these vessels to good advantage. A
further development took place in 1882, when the
firm considered it advisable to enter the Sydney
trade, the then firm of John Fraser and Co. becoming
their agents, and supplying the necessary wharf ac-
commodation. Later on a branch office was -opened*
and a wharf leased by the company. It was
soon found that the steamers Nemesis, Lin-
dus, and Wendouree were inadequate for the
extended trade, and Mr. Huddart was com-
missioned to build in England two steamers of a
superior type, the vessels being named the Burrum-
beet and Corangamite, and these steamers were
amongst the first in which the triple expansion engines
were introduced. The Nemesis was the big steamer
of its day, built of iron, 1393 tons gross register,
240 ft. long, 34ft. wide, and 17ft. deep, and carried
1800 tons dead weight, eight passengers, and a crew
of 27.
During the developments which have just been
enumerated, it became apparent that the two
businesses, namely the Geelong and Melbourne
trade and the inter-State business, which now over-
shadowed the former, should be amalgamated, and in
1886 Mr. Parker transferred half his interest in the
steamers Despatch, Alert and Excelsior to Mr.
James Huddart, who then attained an equal interest
with the other partners, and was appointed general
manager of the firm, which in all its branches
was carried on under the name adopted in
1876—Huddart, Parker & Company. Two years
later, namely, in 1878, the present limited
company was formed, with a capital of £300,000, each
of the partners taking up a fourth of the shares, Mr.
Ernest J. Parker joining the Board. A year or two
afterwards Mr. W. T. Appleton and Mr. John L.
Webb were also made directors.
Trade with Tasmania was commenced in August
of the year 1889, the p.s. Newcastle being in the first
instance chartered to run between Melbourne and
Launceston, the Coogee afterwards being altered and
placed in the trade. The service between Sydney
and Hobart was initiated by the steamer Wendouree
in November of the same year. In 1890 the operas
tions of the Company were extended to South
and Western Australia, the Nemesis being the
first of the Company’s steamers to be encaged
in that service. The s.s. Tasmania was built in 1892,
and employed in the different trades carried on by
the Company as occasion required. Ultimately the
Company, having determined to enter the New
Zealand trade, placed her, in November, 1893, in the
running between Sydney, Auckland, Wellington,
Lyttelton, and Dunedin, and vice versa, and later
she had as her consort the steamer Anglian, pur-
chased from the Union Co., of London, trading to
South Africa. In addition to the developments of
these trades, the Port Phillip Bay excursion trade re-
ceived attention, and the splendid paddle steamer
Hygeia was built on the Clyde to run as a special ex-
cursion boat between Melbourne and Queenscliff and
other watering places, and in addition the Company
gave attention to the towage trade both in Mel-
bourne and in Adelaide by providing the powerful
steam tugs Eagle and Falcon.
Since 1895 rapid developments have taken place in
the New Zealand and Tasmanian trades, and the
Company has added to its fleet the steamers
Wimmera, Victoria, Zealandia, and Westralia, the
first-named running a regular service between Mel-
bourne, Hobart, Bluff, Dunedin, Lyttelton, Welling-
ton and Sydney, and vice versa; and the Victoria
and Zealandia making a fortnightly boat from
Sydney to Auckland, Gisborne, Napier, Wellington,
Lyttelton, and Dunedin, and rice versa ; while the
‘ Westralia maintains the service between Hobart and
Sydney. During the same period the trade on the
epast has not been neglected, and to the fleet of late
years have been added the Barwon, Corio, Moora-
bool. and Yarra, carrying coal from the New South
Wales collieries to Melbourne and Adelaide, and
produce back again. The fine new steamer Riverina,
built by Sir James Laing and Sons, of Sunderland, in
conjunction with the Burrumbeet and Anglian, is
employed in the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, West
Australian trade.
The Company has now building in England the
Ulimaroa, a magnificent twin-screw steamer of 5700
tons register, 400 ft. long and 52ft. beam, with accom-
modation for 420 passengers in three classes, and
extensive stock and refrigerated space. In addition,
an order has just been placed fora 5500 tons dead-
weight cargo boat.
The euphonious name Ulimaroa is taken from
Hawkesworth’s edition of Captain Cook’s First
Voyage, Vol. 11., Chapter 5 : —“ December 9th, 1769,
Doubtless Bay, N.Z. While we lay becalmed several
canoes came off tous... and findiyg these people so in-
telligent we enquired if they knew any country besides
their own. They answered that their ancestors had told
them that to the north-west by north or north-north
west there was a country of great extent called Uli-
maroa, to which some people had sailed in a very
large canoe, and that only a part of them had returned
and reported that, after a passage of a month, they had
seen a country where the people eat hogs.”
The head office of the Company is
in Melbourne, with branch offices at
Sydney,' Newcastle, Wellington,
Hobart, Geelong, and Bal-
larat, while the Company
is represented by
agencies at the vari-
ous other ports
to which the trade
extends. The
present directors
are :—Mr. John
Traill, Chairman
(who recently cele-
brated his jubilee
in shipping), and
Messrs. W. T.
Appleton, J. L.
Webb, and Cap-
tain T. L. Webb,
the last - named
residingat Sydney.

USE OF CUTICURA HAS
A MARVELOUS RESULT
“My husband and I thought you
would like to know what the Cuticura
Remedies have done for our baby boy.
He had running eczema from birth.
It developed itself after the first month.
The poor little fellow’s head was quite
raw, his face was a sickening sight and
the dreadful humour would soak his
pillow through in a single night. It
wore him to a shadow. People who
saw him said, ‘How can you wish him
to live?’ Two doctors saw him; one
recommended Cuticura Remedies, but
could do little else for him, for it was so
obstinate. We tried several remedies,
in fact everything we could think of and
were told of. At last we got Cuticura
Ointment, and together with the Cuti-
cura Soap the result was marvelous, for
I have not finished one box and the
skin is now perfectly clear. It has all
dried up and his hair is growing won-
derfully, and instead of sleepless nights
he has the proper sound sleep. Mrs.
C. Baker, 28, Victoria Road, Bland-
ford, Dorset, March 12, 1906.”

CONSTIPATION
is the most common and fruitful cause of suffering, especially
among women. It may arise from a variety of causes, but is
most frequently due to a torpid liver. When the liver becomes
torpid and inactive the bowels become sluggish and constipated,
foul and noxiops gases are absorbed into the system, poisoning
the blood and nerve centres, and producing headaches, languor,
difficulty in breathing, sleeplessness, and general disorder of
the system. Drastic purgatives don’t cure constipationthey
may give temporary relief, but do not remove the cause—
TORPID LIVER
The remedy is Mother Seigel’s Syrup. Read this:—“l used to
get very bad turns of biliousness, with violent headaches, which
made life a misery for me. I tried many remedies without
benefit, and also dieted myself; but as for that I could hardly
eat anything, and whatever I ate made me suffer. But with the
first bottle of Mother Seigel’s Syrup I began to mend and after
a course of that great medicine I was quite cured."—From

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

The Ballarat Banking Company invariably fees the
reporters who attend the half-yearly meetings as a matter
of duty. Each scribe is handed out a sovereign. In the
palmy days of Ballarat, the mining companies used to fee
the reporters ; and a few of them still provide drinks and
cigars to all and sundry who attend the meetings.

Country correspondents supply most of the humorous
reading of the daily papers. One of the tribe lately
wrote in great excitement to the S. A. Register, that an
error had crawled into his last budget of news. “It was
Brown, not Jones, who rushed out and stopped the
horse.” And the mighty Register gravely announced
that later advices from Dustville showed that Brown and
not Jones made rapid progress to the front and reduced
the velocity of the steed. Thus does the truth prevail.

of N.S.W. (South Aus.), etc., has attained its 1000th issue.
No less than 503,101,043 copies of Answers have been sold

teristically—“ If all these copies were placed on end they
would reach four times round the globe.” A cheerless

The working journalist seems to have come into his
own in the Dominionette. With the starting of a new
morning paper in Wellington, a dozen oi so new positions
were created, and the competent man found his stork
had gone up 50 per cent. In one office where there was
a danger of defection, the spirit of unrest was quieted by
advancing the pittance of sundry hacks by a pound a
week, and even in offices a long way from Wellington
there was a fattening of the pay envelope that meant
much in a land where you can get fairly drunk for Is. (id.

“ True William ”: Once on a time I strolled into the
Melbourne newspaper office in which the warrior bows his
crested head (when he isn’t absent in Europe or South
Africa) over the copy and the proofs. In my younger
days this literary military personage used to be a Major.
Therefore, I asked for him by that title. The minion
to whom I spoke appeared paralysed, and tottered
on his basis. Then he braced up, and breathed
heavily for a second, moistened his dry lips with his
tongue, and said in a hollow voice, “ You mean Colonel.”
I said I really meant General, and the earth, which had
stopped, moved on its axis again.

Although it lost money in its recent fight with the
London Publishers’ Association over the high price of
books, The Times has something to show for the hole in
its pocket. All the publishers have brought their prices
down. Macmillan and Longmans have come down in
some cases to one-third of their former figures. Ohatto
and Windus and Sisely and 00. are issuing former four-
and-sixpenny volumes at 2s. 6d. ; Routledge’s half-crown
books can be got for Is. IOJd. ; and the Blackwoods and
William Heinemann have brought their six-shilling

“Agricola”: A certain Riverina weekly says it has
decided leanings towards Preetrade. At least, it opposed
Bill Lyne with all the ink it could squeeze on to its
p iges. In its editorial page for 28/8/’O7 it clamored loudly
against the “iniquitous tariff” in leaders, sub-leaders,
and notes. A full two-column report of a scrap of an
indignation meeting, which pledged itself to oppose the
“ abominable tariff,” appeared in a prominent page. A
little farther on there loomed up a long Melbourneletter,
the writer of which upheld the tariff with enthu-
siasm. Farther on again, the Sydney letter occupied a
full page. The writer threw up his hat undisguisedly
over the tariff, and drew pictures of the coming pros-
perity of the State. He also poured contempt on the
Sydney dailies for -their prevaricating and misleading
articles. Yet, on the editorial page, these rags were
congratulated on their brave stand against the tariff,
i Similarly, on one page Joke Carruthers was called a
“ hero ” for stealing the wire-netting, and on the other
I page he was called a plain “ thief.” That paper isn’t
1 content with being all things to all men. It is also all
f things to some hogs.

I It occurred in the time of the late Thaddeus O’Kane, of
the Northern Miner, Charters Towers. One very-
wet evening the old man sent a reporter to the School of
Arts to write up a Presbyterian concert. Midnightcame
round before the reporter turned up considerably blith-
ered, and the foreman barked at him for his copy. He
had none. He was searched, but the only property
about him was a hiccup. He hadn’t gone near the School
of Arts, so another reporter grabbed the advertised pro-
gramme, and dashed off a flattering notice, mentioning
the encores, vociferous applause, etc. At nine o’clock
next morning the Presbyterian parson arrived with a
long horse-countenance to interview Thady, and asked
him to explain the report. “ What explanation is
required ?’’ said Thady. “ I thought it was rather a com-
plimentary notice.” “ But,” wailed the sky-pilot,
“ owing to the inclemency of the weather, the concert
didn’t take place ! ” Retorted the old man, without a
blush: “ What are you growling about? Any fool can
report a concert that does take place, but it takes a smart
fellow to report one that doesn’t 1 ”
THE GEESE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Galli.. anseres non fefellere. —Livy.)
The wise man nods, the brave man sleeps,
The watchdog slumbers heavy-eyed,
As dimly on the rampart creeps
The Gaul, no scabbard by his side ;
But through the dark and dangerous peace
There breaks the gabbling of the geese.
The garrisons of modern days
Sleep calm and cosy in a bed,
While all night long the printers race
Through stories yearning to be read.—
And o’er the morning’s eggs and grease
There comes the glory of the geese !
“ Pro Bono Publico ” leaps out,
A gander with a voice like sin,
“ Constant Subscriber ” starts to shout,
And good old “ Verbum Sap ” chips in ;
Mother of Five,” before they cease,
Has wakened all her sister geese.
“A colonist of ’52”
Checks new invaders every night,
And wild alarums gallop through
The tale of “ Lifelong Rechabite ” ;
Then loud and raucous and obese
Struts “ Flinders-lane ” amid the geese.
“Nine Years a Resident ” is heard
In cackle of uncanny sound,
While “ Orangeman ”—unlovely bird !
Within the joss-house whizzes round,
Till strident “ Where Are Our Police ? ”
Browns all the din of other geese.
So sleep may blind the warriors’ eyes,
The sentries may be set in vain,
Dulness beset brains ne’er so wise,
The priest lie dreaming in his fane ;
The foe may bring their souls release,
But, Lord, he won’t get past the geese 1

WORKS A WONDERFUL CHANGE.
(BY A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
So many go on suffering year by year through
lack of serviceable information, it is deemed ad-
visable to place before the public the story of Mrs.
Mary Janeßudd, of 38 Young-street, Redfern, so
that a salutary lesson may be learned. What
Mrs. Budd said to our special was this :
“It is now eight years since my husband died,
a Calamity that took place when we had been
living in this house nine years, s‘o you see I have
been residing here a good while.”
“Yes,” assented the reporter. “I believe you
are an old resident of these parts ? ”
“ I was born in Bourke-street, and have lived in
this locality all my life. But, to go back to my
story. It was not long after my great bereavement
that I became a total wreck. The blow nearly
killed me, and for a good while I was really
stupefied with grief. For some considerable time
my memory was completely lost, and it was im-
possible for me to concentrate my mind for a few
minutes upon any subject. When my dazed con-
dition passed away it was then that 1 realised how
terribly my whole system had suffered, a fact
which dawned upon me as I stood at the table one
day feeling so ill that I did not think I would live
till the morrow. For my own part, I did not care
what happened, but I thought of my three little
children, and said to myself : ‘ What ever can I
take to do me good for their sakes ? ’ ”
“ Was that the first time you thought of taking
anything?” vs 5
“ It was the first time I thought of acting on
my own judgment, the reason being that I was
under a doctor for some length of time, and his
treatment hadn’t benefited me in the least.”
“What did your medical attendant say was
wrong with you ? ”
“He told me I had taken my afflictions in-
wardly, and that my nervous system was in a very
weak state. I knew that well enough, unfortu-
nately, for I could not even bear to hear the
children talking, their voices got on my nerves so,
andif a tap came to the door I nearly fainted with
fright. I hadn’t the least desire for food, and I
Ihinjc one of my greatest afflictions was my in-
ability to gpt to sleep. For four years I did not
know what it was to sleep properly for one night.
It was usual for me to remain awake till about 3
or 4 o clock in the morning, and then dose off till
half-past 5, when I always awoke with a start, and
would get no. more sleep till next morning. And
the dreams I had each time I slept—they were
awful.”
You must have lost weight during vour
illness?” 0 •
‘‘ oh , ! . I was ghastly. My bones were almost
protruding through my skin, and anybody seeing
me could not have thought otherwise than that I
would never get better again. I really thought 1
was doomed to die, and feel sure I would hav-
TnATTn ad J7 o ufr, a #°.S N & Y Foli CLEMENTy
TONIC, WHICH WAS THE LAST MEOT
OF ALL THAT I TOOK. AfHendSSi
used to say Why don’t you try some Clements
J onlc . but I always postponed doing so ; but at
last 1 thought that as I had heard so much about
it, and nothing else could do me any good, I would
?l V a Flemen ! s 1 ° mc , a trial. This was the decision
that I came to the day that I stood at the table
reeling that I could not last another twenty-four
hours, so what better reason than that could I have
for saying than Clements Tonic saved my life’
ou must understand that I was quite incapable
of doing any work ana that it was a common thing
for me to be in.bed a fortnight at a time, utterly
unable to attend to anything that required seeing
to, so when Clements Tonic began to put a little
hfe and strength into me you can imagine how
thankful I was for it. And weren’t the neighbors
surprised to hear that I had taken a turn for the
better ?'My word, it was a matter that astonished
nearly the whole of Redfern. But what a relief
it was to have my headaches ease off after suffer-
ing so ong with them ! And wasn’t I glad to feel
that Clements lonic was also doing good to mv
nervous system ? Why, I had only been taking
that remedy a few weeks when I could stand noises
of any kind without wincing, and already I was
getting more sleep than I had had for years.”
“Did you feel more refreshed after it’than
formerly ?’
“ C. 11 ! ? e f; much. The reason why, I suppose
was that I did not dream at all, so both my brain
and body were resting all the time, and when I
awoke 1 felt so fresh and lighthearted—no nasty
taste in the mouth as before, a clean tongue and
my word, what an appetite for breakfast I had !
Clements Tonic did make me eat and no mistake
and my nerves were getting stronger and stronger
as the days went by. Eventually my old fears and
imaginations died right away, nothing more
troubling me, and all this wonderful change was
entirely due to Clements Tonic. Oh ! I have
thanked God thousands of times that I was guided
to take that remedy, and I am so anxious that
other sufferers may regain hope by hearing of my
cure. But Clements Tonic served me well in other
ways. It put an end to the giddy feelings I used
to have, removed the swollen feeling from my
eyes and the suffocating sensations from my chest
then, finally, built up my strength so perfectly
that everyone could see my health was thoroughly
regained.” J

THOB. CAJXPY. J.P,
“ Cross-ISJ ibs ” sends a pub dialogue :
“ Y’r can’t tell me anything about these medical
blokes,” said the man with the two-storey ohln, as he
pushed his vacant glass to the centre of the counter
JUickmg off the discarded portion of an eschalot that
had fallen upon his abdominal curve, he leered at the
man who was sipping- gin beside him.
. That person, after gazing at the counter lunch reflect-
ively, remarked that he could not. He always doctored
himself, and his medicine only cost him “ thrippence a
touch.”
“Y’r lucky, old bloke,” growled the other. Then
tapping the centre button on his vest, he said im-
pressively, ‘‘ This ’ere ’as cost me a few lov’ly quid.”
1 Must ’ave reared it beside a liberal table,” said the
schnapps drinker, eyeing the watch-chained convexness
intently.
The dual-chinned man grinned derisively.
“S’truth, you don’t understand me old son" he
answered. “Look’ere. I was feelin’ crook a couple o’
months ago, so I seen a doctor. He got ’is stethescope on
me, felt my pulse, an’ inquired my occupation. Told

muttered about nerves an’ excitement, an’ suggested th’

“So I got into a private ’orspital, an’ then inter bed.

The big man fell down dead.
In West Queensland the local publicans
playa big part in politics. The W. Q. Bung is nearly
always—for evident reasons—strong Labor, and
ins trail is, more or less, over many of the little
organisations. The early Queensland Labor party
consisted principally of total abstainers, and the
thought of any kind of alliance or friendship with
the publican party would have horrified its mem-
bers. However, Bung is a close friend now in the
West, and Labor is so much the poorer.


Tenders.
Sale of Valuable Gold-
Mining' Lease (SI Plant.
RENDERS are invited for the purchase of the Mining
-*■ Lease No. 4305 Beechworth, with Plant and Machinery
thereon, known as “ Woolshed,” and forming part of the
Estate of the late Hon. J. A. Wallace.
The Lease comprises about 269 acres, of which about
100 acres have been worked.
Mrs. Ada Wallace, the Executrix of the Will of the late
Hon. J. A. Wallace, desires to wind up the estate as soon
as possible, and has therefore decided to place this claim
on the market for sale by tender.
The method adopted for working is'by Hydraulic Sluic-
ing, and a large, powerful, and well-equipped plant is
now at work on the property.
The water supply is good, and there is a large storage
dam on the claim.
Two water rights, Nos. 742 and 755, are held in connec-
tion with the dam, and will be included in the sale.
The barge is now operating in the bed of the creek,
and the ground ahead has been tested by means of bores,
and the results as given by this method show that the
ground is highly payable, and that the bottom is soft and
suitable for sluicing.
It is estimated that about eight acres of ground can be
dealt with each year, and from the position now occupied
by the barge to the head of the Lease, this would give
about 13 years work. The lowest part of the Lease could
be worked by dredging, if it were thought inadvisable to
move the barge down to that portion of the ground.
The average depth of the ground to be worked is esti-
mated at about 33ft.
Further particulars and full details of the plant can be
obtained on application at the office of the Executrix,
352 Collins Street, Melbourne, or at the office of Messrs.
Rollason, Brandon and Co., 47 Queen Street, Melbourne,
where orders to view and forms of tender can also be
obtained.
Tenders on the above-mentioned forms are to be sent
to the Executrix at the above address, and must be
delivered on or before the 21st day of October, 1907.
CONDITIONS.
1. Each Tender must be■ accompanied by a Banker’s
cheque for 5 per cent, of the amount of the Tender,
which cheques will be returned to the unsuccessful Ten-
derers.
2. The successful Tenderer is to pay the balance of the
purchase money in cash on or before November 30, 1907.
3. The successful Tenderer is, within a week after
acceptance of his tender, to sign a contract, which may
be inspected at the above address-
4. The highest or any Tender will not necessarily be
accepted.

BRONCHITIS AND ASTHMA.
A SYDNEY RESIDENT SUFFERED FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS.
SO BAD HE DARED NOT STIR.
RELIEVED IN A FEW MINUTES BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
WOULD GIVE £5O FOR THE SAME BENEFIT RATHER THAN SUFFER.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Friend,—Chronic Bronchitis I had from birth, and lam now 66 years old. Some time
back I contracted Aschma, and for months I was so bad that any remedy that had previously relieved smothering’
was of no use to me. I was so bad that I dared not stir, and spent the worst night I ever h id. When in a conversa-
tion, Mr. March, J.P., of Balmain, Sydney, kindly told me that a friend of his was using your Bronchitis Cure, ana
that it was good. So my sister bought me a bottle of it, and in a few minutes after taking the nrst dose 1 couia
breathe a little. The next day I was better, and kept getting better every day. # To-day I am better than 1 nave
been for the last seven years. I took the medicine as directed, six bottles, and it cost me less than l would
give £5O for the same benefit rather than suffer as I did. Please make what use of this letter you think nt, ii by so
doing it would only cause one to get rid of this fearful complaint.—Yours faithfully, . .

minded and so setting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that HEAKJN L o BKU«L,±llllo ourtij
has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact, and to request you in youi own in eies s o
particular to ask for HEARN h’S and see that you get it.

BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of
digestion by Infants and Invalids.
g
fdg
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.
Benger’s Food is sold in tins by Chemists, etc., everywhere.
“ Janor ” on victuals :
This food fad business makes a sound, healthy grafter
smile ; and he also notes that the faddists are mostly of
the leisured class. There’s nothing wrong with the
ordinary workaday meal, providing the meat isn t
diseased, that the other things are not adulterated, and
that the cooking is good. It calls for little alteration ;it
is the breed of the eater that requires improvement.
Given a social system under which every individual would
have to do a certain amount of work or fast, and which
controlled the production of the race on stud-book lines,
and the food faddist would be an unknown quantity. As
things are, the tucker tinkerer increases and multiplies
daily. If he went to work he’d be too hungry at meal
times to theorise. I once put in a winter on the coldest
part of the Australian Alps, working in a rise on a reef
underlying at an angle of 45 degrees. It was bad
ground, and we were putting in very heavy
timber, nothing less than 20in. in diameter. These
logs had to be pulled up the slimy surface by
hand. Taking it all round, it was a strenuous job. And
we ate ! One week our butcher’s bill (mate and self) got
up to 421 b. ; but that was the record. Now, a food-
fadder would have died in that rise first shift. Have just
been reading in a Snips publication some interviews with
the leading food idiots of England. They all go nap on
semi-starvation, total abstinence, and no tobacco. Rot 1
I’m pretty ancient now, have eaten about a drove of bul-
locks, never turned my back on a glass of grog, and have
smoked half-a-ton of tobacco. And I’m open to run,
jump, or wrestle any food-faddist, irrespective of age;
or if he’s off physical culture, I’ll take him on at chess
or mathematics. Get an axe, oh dyspeptic one, and
chop out for thyself an appetite !

Headache, Indigestion and
Constipation.
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, lias been discovered, which is
now completely curing each of tile
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in affording quick relief. You
do not require to go on takißg them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a dose of Frootoids when ill and
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective,
j Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient, but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost, .impor-
tance that this should be borne in
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
People should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses with each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frootoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose ot Frootoids, instead of an or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the. pa-
tient Will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so become quite
independent of the necessity of taking
any aperient medicine.
Frootoids are only now being placed
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in getting them from your local che-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them,
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price,
1/6, to W. G. Hearne, Chemist, Gee-
long, and a bottle of them will be im-
mediately forwarded to you post free.
Chemists, © storekeepers, and r whole-
salers can now obtain wholesale sup-
plies from W. G. Hearne, Chemist,

They are as - easy of digestion as maternal milk, and

The Milk Foods ' are absolutely free from any noxious

A Promise To You
Good Health
Clear Skin
Sweet Breath
Hearty Appetite
Sound Sleep
Happiness
You can have all these if your
bowels work right. Good Bowels
are the secret of Good Health,
just the same as Bad Bowels are
the cause of sickness and disease.
Don’t wait until you are flat on
your back before you will believe
that there is something wrong with
your bowels. “ A stitch in time
saves nine.” When your head
aches, or your tongue is coated,
or your breath is heavy, that’s
the time to take a Reuter’s Little
Pill.
They strengthen the walls of the
bowels and induce a snake-like
movement, (the movement of na-
ture) which propels the waste
matter upon its way. That’s just
where they differ from salts, jalap,
sedlitz powders, cascara, and the
old fashion pill which simply blast
out the contents of the bowels.
Reuter’s Little Pills will cure the
most obstinate cases of constipa-
tion and indigestion without dis-
comfort or inconvenience. The
after effects of heavy dinners, late
suppers, whiskey, wine or beer
drinking, nervous excitement and
other similar strains upon the sys-
tem are quickly relieved by Reut-
er’s Little Pills.
We are spending a good many
thousand pounds to let the world
know what a true and loyal friend
it has in Reuter’s Little Pills, and
on this account there naturally has
sprung up imitators and substi-
tutors. We caution you to beware
of these unscrupulous thieves of
trade. A dishonest man will al-
ways try to sell you a dishonest
article. Beware of the smooth-
speaking clerk with his " Just as
Good” story. He makes more
money when he substitutes.
Reuter's Little Pills are made
by Barclay & Co., New York,
U. S. A. They are the only pills
containing the combination of
vegetable ingredients which will
fulfill the claims made for them.
This is the package. Be sure you
get it.

Mat-Fever.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, well we know this illness, we South
Sea-sailing men,
We catch it .u the stillness of isles outside
the ken
Of cities and convention, and moralists and such,
Where work finds little mention, and nothing
matters much.
Where every prospect pleases, and Man, however
vile,
Swift absolution seizes on seeing Somnus smile
His tropic smile, so soothing, that subtly-seems to
say, -
Each frowning scruple smoothing: “ Sufficient to
the day.
“ Sufficient just to capture such comfort as we can;
Come, take the moment’s rapture, the future
baffles man.
Cool, shaded huts invite you, you may not shirk
the call
Where yielding mats delight you with their
mesmeric thrall.”
For wander-lust is over for such as reach those
isles,
The most persistent rover their blandishment
beguiles
To abstinence from fretting; for here, indeed, is
life
'* A-sleeping and forgetting,” beyond all spurs
and strife.
They grapple our affection, these ease-bred island
ways,
The rest from circumspection, the freedom of the
days
That claim not keen distraction, that wake no
vain desire,
Whose trade winds’ fanning action is all that we
require.
Blow, breezes, blow, and let us cast Care upon
your blast—
The friends who don’t regret us, frayed fancies of
the past;
Bleak thoughts these bring abaft them, and
thoughts are needless fuss,
Blow, breezes, blow, and waft them away, away
from us.
So retrospect grows hazy, more disregarded still,
As, summer-steeped and lazy, we doze along until
After life’s matful fever we swoon to sounder
sleep,
When Time, the ruthless reiver, his ripened crop
shall reap.
Dear days, for me soon ending ! Still, here, upon
the wall,
My best-loved mats depending, your latitudes
recall.
How fancy used to wander! What dreams I
used to dream!
Upon the old mats yonder, by Vaisingano’s
stream !
A cup of brimming measure I pledge that dead
time in,
For it was purely pleasure, though maybe judged
as sin
By such as deem toil duty; enough it was for me
To glory in a beauty I never else may see.
White, coral-sanded beaches, blue sky, and bluer
sea;
Surf-silvered reef that reaches from weather-side
to lee;
Tall, feathered palms a-quiver, as through their
frond ed mass
Sigh zephyrs that deliver sweet perfumes as they
pass.
Steep, battlemented mountains, upon whose dark
fagades
Splash out, like foaming fountains, a hundred
bright cascades :
Beneath the purpled passes, between them and
the sea,
Sweep swards of swaying grasses, as green as
green can be.
Ah, swift to recollection the haunting pictures
rise !
And oft in their direction my inclination flies,
Where I may follow after in person, too, ere long
For, lands where life is laughter, your lure is over-
strong.
Then quit of worldly clamor, resuming Island
ways,
All in the golden glamor of sun-suffusioned days;
Free, careless and contented, above description
blest,
Samoa, the sweet-scented, shall wheedle me to
rest.

TALAFEKAU.
At the Glaciarium,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was nearly closing time when he drifted into
the Glaciarium. He put down his shilling,
and called confidently for a “ whisky and
soda.” The clerk was good-natured. He smiled
at the pleasantry and passed out the usual check.
Then it dawned on our hero that he had come to
some place of entertainment, and he passed some-
what uncertainly into the interior with a firm
resolve to enjoy himself. His glassy eye soon
detected the rushing, rolling, sliding, squirming
mass on the rink. A small boy dodged as he
frantically waved his hat.
“Hooray,” he yelled. It was not an artistic
yell. It cracked half way, and ended in a husky
hiccough. “ Hooray, a foo’ball match.”
The old lady with the curled feathers in her
bonnet vacated her seat hurriedly, and left for less
convivial quarters. Did he care? Not he.
He was keeping his resolve to enjoy himself—and
enjoy himself he would, at all costs.
On the rink a nervous youth with a pimply face
wobbled desperately for an instant. That instant
was his downfall— the fall was none the less
severe because of its suddenness. His fall was
the signal for others. A sportive couple, a fair-
haired girl and a “nice” boy, who were cutting
fantastic figures on the ice, were the first to
follow suit. The figures they cut were still more
fantastic. The nervous youth endeavored to
crawl out. To all appearances his sole object was
to hide himself without exciting comment in the
process. He had no wish to argue the point with
the cold, hard ice. But misfortune gripped him.
His skates caught in the girl’s fair hair, and took
some of it away. His nervousness increased, and
he crawled excitedly, the lock of hair trailing
behind, like the tail of a comet. The sportive
couple regained their feet and moved off, slowly and
sadly, the girl ever and anon casting back wistful
glances at the lost lock of hair. It could be seen
that she wanted that hair. The pair had
apparently lost all interest in the proceedings.
So had the nervous youth. Not so our hero.
This game was unique—he was enjoying himself.
He felt tempted to join the participants, but the
restraining hand of an officious attendant held
him back as he endeavored to scale the barrier.
Suddenly he turned with ferocity on the small
boy who had dodged. “ Who’s playin’ ?” he de-
manded.
The boy fled. Those at a safe distance
tittered.
Failing to get satisfaction, he slept. As he
slept he smiled contentedly.
And still the game on the ice went on. Up
the rink came a conglomerate mass—heads and
feet, arms and legs—intermingled in wild con-
fusion.
Real Ice Skating ! The “ Poetry of Motion ! ”
The poetry of motion indeed. Ask that anxious-
looking individual with the side whiskers as he
stands so earnestly (on the ice one must need
stand earnestly) ask him as he stands so
earnestly balancing with such care, what
he thinks of the “poetry of motion.” How
he perspires ! Note the lines deepen about
his mouth as he feels his ankles giving
way under him ! Note the appealing glances
he casts at his slippery footing ! Take your
eyes from his confusion as at last he succumbs
in a shapeless mass on the relentless ice. Even
his side whiskers seem to have joined the forces
allied against him, and hold him down in spite ol
his well-meant efforts to rise. One would think
he would be pleased to rest awhile. But no. Fie
cannot rest content until he regains his feet —and
not even then. Gome away, and spare his blushes.
Pass on to the young lady who is deriving much
enjoyment from pulling herself round the rink by
the railing of the barrier. See the earnest resolve
pictured on her features. She will go home to-
night and tell her friends that “ it is just lovely,
and she’s getting on splendidly.” She will not
tell them that for the sake of comfort she carried
one skate in her hand. She thinks it so much easier
to learn “ one leg at a time.” She is quite ob-
livious of the squirming horde in the centre of
the rink. They do not interest her. She has no
time. She is learning to skate —to skate on real
ice, just like the English.
But what is this —rub the moisture from your
glasses and look again. Surely this is no mortal.
Watch him as he winds through the tangle of
arms and legs, hands in pockets, gliding easily
and gracefully as a swallow. No wonder that the
spectators hold their breath as he passes. He is
a god, and for a moment the worms wriggling
out there in the centre are forgotten.
But our hero ? As he awoke he heard a young
lady beside him remark : “ Yes, I am fond of
horses. We have eight.”
He was flattered. At his age, young ladies did
not annoy him with attentions. He turned
politely, smiling genially.
“You are mos' fortunate, m’ dear young lady,”
he gurgled, “I’m also ver’ fond of horses, but
I’ve only got two, ’n one of ’em is no dash’ good.
No dash’ good at all.”
The young lady blushed furiously. The next
instant he was afforded an excellent opportunity
of studying her back. Dear me ! What is this
he has found? A button unfastened on her
blouse ! She must be informed. He leaned
towards her confidentially.
“ ’Scuse me,” he said in husky whispers.
“ ’Scuse ”
But she was gone. He could only wonder
vaguely.
Once more his wandering gaze fell on the centre
of interest, and he brightened perceptibly.
“What yer runnin’ ’way for?” he asked
severely of a perspiring individual who was
charging furiously for a haven of safety.
The one addressed lost his head, also his
balance. His feet shot out suddenly, likewise
his arms. Fie did not recover his balance, but he
dislodged a neighbor’s tooth.
“ Mos’ cowardly,” muttered our now in-
tensely interested spectator. “ Mos’ cowardly
to strike a man like that.” But the game called
him. A worried frown puckered his features.
Something evidently was annoying him. He
could contain himself no longer.
“ Spread y’r men out, Cap’n,” he called, indig-
nantly, pointing an accusing finger at the tangle in
the centre. “ Don’ let ’em close up in that way.
That’sh not way to play. Now, when I was a
young feller ” His interest was attracted by
a “ young feller ” crawling painfully to the edge.
“ Badly hurt?” he inquired, solicitously. There
was no reply.
Apparently, he was hurt —badly. Ere our hero
cduld hasten to the assistance of the injured one, the
band struck up. Surely the game was not over.
Yes, the players were leaving. All seemed more
or less injured. This, indeed, had been a good
game. Fie must shake hands with the Captain.
He stepped on to the field. When the stars
cleared, he asked feebly for the Captain.
They informed him, as they picked up the
buttons he had shed, that there was no Captain.
“No Cap’n?” he ejaculated, unbelieving.
“Whatth’ — Why th’
“ There is no Captain,” they explained; “ this
is the Glaciarium. ”
“ Take me home,” he said, weeping.

AN ECHO FROM

Pacific, setting forth the manner in
which Zam-Buk Balm is pursuing its
healing mission among the natives,
fittingly illustrates the wonderful
soothing, antiseptic and healing
powers which Zam-Buk alone pos-
sesses, and the advisability of always
keeping a pot handy in the home for
the ready treatment of all injuries,
diseases, and disorders of the skin.
The Proprietors,
The Zam-Buk Manf’g Co.,
Sydney.
Dear Sirs,—When I received the pot of
Zam-Buk Balm from you, I was suffering
from an ugly gash on my ankle, which was
very painful and caused my leg to swell up to
the knee. I tried different remedies, but
none of them did the wound any good, sol
resolved to give Zam-Buk a trial. Upon
applying the Balm to the wound, the pain
and burning sensation left it. After three applications of Zam-Buk Balm, not only had the
wound on my ankle closed, but all the swelling had entirely disappeared.
Again, I dressed an old Running Ulcer on the shin of one of the natives here, who for the
past 10 years had tried all kinds of European and native remedies, but without avail. Zam-
Buk Balm, however, has given the poor native great relief; stopped the running, and about
half-an-inch of the wound has already healed perfectly.
The natives say “ Zam-Buk koe faitoo mana,” i.e., “ Zam-Buk is a miraculous medicine (or
ointment).” I can safely say that Zam-Buk succeeds where every other kind of healing balm
fails. You are at liberty to use this unsolicited testimonial for the benefit of fellow-
sufferers.

The Challengers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
riding the roaring lists
W of fate in bold emprise,
I What the meed when the fray is past, and
the night leans down the skies ?
Ever they march before us into the virgin lands,
Shouting the fighting chorus
Over the circling sands,
And the uttermost heights have heard the song,
and known their fighting hands.
Frontiersmen, whose arms and hearts are st rong
to play the game ;
The backwoods heard their even song
The night they dared and came,
Blazing a trail through the loneliness with biting,
axe and flame.
These are the brave, the challengers, flinging a
gage to the odds—
To the black defiles and the storm-blown spurs
Where the hill-wood leans and nods ;
And ever before their feet swift death, and the
lightning of the gods.
League-long torrents from out the womb of ravines
thunder-swept,
Dim, lone forests astir with doom,
Where gray fears crouched and crept—
There they have raised the lodge, and there lain
down in peace and slept.
Out of the thresh of our little lives into the
world go they,
That the sick at heart in the crowded hives
May follow in slow array
When the rocking waggons set forth i’ the dawn
for the new lands far away.
Strong souls leading the van—what, then, if few
of ye may return ?
The gate is plain to the earnest men
To enter, and toil, and learn
The pledge of the earth when the white roofs
gleam, and the upland clearings burn.
The herds shall feed in the valley bod, the flocks
on the mountain side,
For the will of the outposts who reach ahead
(Who knows where now they ride?)
And a city rear to the open skies when the great
green woods have died.
Ever they ravish the secret ways, and ever their
cry is hurled
To the wayfarers by the open blaze,
And the twilight tents unfurled :
“ Come up, come up, where the earth is wide on
the hills of this outer world.”
Challengers dead on the bloody shields —what is thy
meed divine ?
J fust of thy memories urned deep, and a nation’s
heart for shrine.

The Unwritten Law.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IyTOW,” said the man, and turned to his
I companion expectantly, ‘ ‘ I should like
an explanation.”
About them were the sounds and scents of a
Javanese night, the pungent odor of strange
flowers and shrubs making the air sweet to faint-
ness, and the chirp and hum of insects stinging
life into the stillness. A little wind blew warm
and gentle from the sloping coffee fields, rustling
the leaves and grasses, and adding to and diffusing
the many odors. A pomegranate tree, with its
flaring fruits mellowed in the starlight, made a
dusky background for the woman’s white figure.
“ I think,” she said, steadily, “ that you have
hardly a right to expect one. Sooner or later I
saw we must come together alone, and so I have
come with you to-night, but I do not think I need
tell you what you ask. Our engagement ended a
year ago.”
The man struck an unnecessary match for his
cigar, and in its quick flare he glanced at the
woman’s face. The face held fear—fear and
shame.
“ Your letters stopped abruptly a year ago,” he
remarked. “ That’s all I know about the matter,
except that a ring and a couple of trinkets found
me after a little wandering. Now I should like to
know the meaning of that—and other things ; for
instance, you, the girl I was engaged to marry in
Sydney, being here on Van Starltszen’s plantation
in mid-Java, alone—with him.”
“ I may refuse to tell you,” she answered.
“ Our engagement is ended, and I think there is
nothing more to say.”
The man faced round on her angrily. ‘ ‘ But I
think there is,” he cried. “ Three years I waited
and worked for you, and then this ! ”
But the woman had learned much in a year,
and she laughed a little.
“ Well played,” she said. “ And if I tell you
what you want,- will you tell me truthfully the story
of those three years of ‘ working and waiting ’ ? ”
Then, as he kept silence : ‘ ‘ Oh, you need not be
afraid. I am not easily frightened—now. And
I think my request fully as reasonable as yours. ”
“ I have lived as well as other fellows,” he
said, “ and I never forgot you.”
She leaned over and touched him, and the scent
from her hair drifted with the perfume of the
gardens. “ You never meant to come back,” she
said quietly.
“He answered her sullenly. “ It’s a lie,” he
said, “ and you know it.”
“ I know that you did not.” She fronted him
with a sudden hot anger. “ Love !” she cried.
“'Do you call it love that binds a girl for any in-
definite period oyer five years, that expects her to
waste the years of her youth—her brightest time
—in return for a letter when you chose to write ? ”
“Anyway, I did like you, and I meant to
marry you,” he persisted, and his voice was a
snarl.
“ Well; say you 'lid,” she said, shortly.
“ When ? When you had wasted the best of my
life. When my youth was narrowed and cramped
while you had taken all that life had to give?
With the dregs of your life and your capacity for
love, you might have come to me, I admit. You
would have travelled and seen what the world had
to show, and then you would, as men put it, have
‘ settled down.’ And I, who had seen nothing,
would have done the same. That was what you
reserved for me.”
“ Wouldn’t it have been better than this, any-
way ? ” he rapped out, coarsely.
“ I hardly think so,” and she held her head
high, ignoring the insult. “ Van Starltszen loves
me a little in his own lawless fashion. And
should I ever have worn a dress like this in
Sydney ? ” There was a hint of pleasure in her
voice.
He looked at her in the little flicker of moon-
light that was stealing from the light drift of
clouds, and he saw how the lines ot the dress dis-
played the curves of her figure. She stood clear-
cut against the massed foliage of the stunted tree,
the white of her body flung out in sharp relief.
And a man loves curves. Desire leaped to his
eyes.
“Van Starltszen will never marry you,” he
said, brutally.
He could not see the flush on her cheeks, but
he guessed by the quick turn of her head that it
was there.
“ I know that,” she answered, “ but I believe,
were it possible, he might. You see he is
separated from his wife. She lives in Holland,
and, being a Catholic, will not divorce him. He
has been very good to me,” she cried of a sud-
den. “ I was so sick of it all in Sydney when I
met Clarkson.”
He winced a little, for he guessed at the
Clarkson she meant, and he bore an evil name.
She had braced herself for her story, but she
told it with averted eyes and tight-locked hands.
“I saw what my life seemed likely to be,” she
said, “ and it wasn’t very appetising. You
don’t know what suburban life can be when you
daren’t go this way and that for fear of meeting
a creditor. I was sick to death of it all, and
there were others behind me, my step-brothers
and sisters—good enough in their way, you know,
but not my way.
“ I answered an advertisement for a barmaid
at the Alsace. I remember how furtively I
sneaked up to the manager and begged for the
chance. He liked my style, so I was a ‘ salooner.’
Then I met Clarkson. He—we went away
together, and after a while we came to Singapore.
He left me—and I met Van Starltszen. He
brought me here. We’ve been here two or three
months. And then you came coffee pricing—-
and that’s all.”
She faced him again, defiantly. “ I’m glad,”
she said. “ Glad ,” and flung her arms out in an
all-embracing gesture that took in all the beauty
of the scene, the tropic perfume, the whispering
stillness, and all the witchery of a central Java
night. “ I’ve wanted it ! I’ve the roving blood
and the love of life and color in me. This is my
birthright, and I’ve longed for it. But,” and her
voice grew womanly soft, “I’m sorry, Frank, if
you cared.”
“ Cared ! Good God ! ” and he gripped her
hands. “ Cared ! ”
He kissed her roughly, as a woman loves to be
kissed, and held her close, as a woman, with her
love for physical contact, loves to be held.
“ Give it up,” he said. “ Give it up and come
away with me. -I’ll go to-morrow, if you like.”
She drew her hands away slowly, and stood
silent while he watched her. There was a hot
desire in his voice that she knew and answered.
“ Frank,” she said, “ I don’t pretend to love
you as I once understood love, and I’m not
unhappy here. Starltszen’s very good to me.
But —perhaps—I’d like to try respectability again. ”
She caught at his hands. “Ah, you are good,
Frank, and I’m sorry, dear, sorry. But 111 try
to make up to you. There’s not one man in a
hundred would do it. I’ll be a good wife to you,
Frank. I’ll try not to let you regret.”
But the man’s passion was born of the night
and the climate as much as of the woman, and
though it was hot he was cool-headed enough
yet to know when he was going too far. He
let her hands drop.
“ I’m sorry, Madge, but—l don’t—think-—you
quite—understand. I ” (he stayed awhile)
“ admit I’ve .been no saint, but a man’s a man all
the world over, and —well, it’s always been the
law that a man’s life’s his own, but his wife must
come to him—clean.”
She stood very still for a moment, her hands
clenched tight.
“ I think I understand very well,” she said.
“I suppose that we—women generally, I mean
—have made the law ourselves. We have never
loved the saints, but we have always been the
hardest to each other.”
A passionate anger shook her. She was half
hysterical, and her voice was choked and quiver-
ing as a woman’s is when she is tightening her
muscles to keep back the tears.
“ I think I understand. Oh, yes, I under-
stand, and I think, too, that I gave you credit for
too much courage.”
“ Madge ! ” —he would have caught her hands
again—would have explained, and (for the spell
of the tropics was on him) he might have pro-
mised almost anything. But Van Starltszen’s
voice came rolling out of the darkness calling her
name.
The big Dutchman carried a scarlet wrap, and
he drew it about her shoulders with a jealous care.
“ It grows chill, my bird,” he said, and his
rich voice was very tender.
He turned to the Englishman, who was awk-
wardly lighting a cigar in a vain effort to catch a
glimpse of his host’s face.
“ Mynheer,” he said, and his tone was courte-
ous, but sharply decided, “ it grows late, and chill
as well, but our Java days are warm, and they
who travel do so in the early morning. The sun-
set promised us heat to-morrow. You have a
long ride before you, and, if you would go early,
I think, Mynheer, if I were you, I should get
some rest.”
Van Starltszen also lit a cigar, and the light
showed a look in his eve which was a warning.

The Leader of Them All!
That is, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla; not
some other kind, but “Ayer’s.”
This grand old family medicine
has stood the test for over sixty
years. That’s the kind you
should take. You cannot afford
to experiment, your health is
too precious.
You may not now be really ill
from some well-defined disease, and yet
you know you are all run down, your
nerves are unstrung, and you feel weak
and discouraged.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
is the strongest and best medicine you can
take to remove this tired and exhausted
feeling. It brings cheer, hope, courage.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disap-
point you. Be sure that you get “AYER’S.”
