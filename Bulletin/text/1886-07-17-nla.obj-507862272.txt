Impbbial Federation, in the near future, will
be the main question of Australasian politics.
Upon its decision mighty issues depend,
for the future of these colonies will be in-
volved in its adoption or rejection. Aus-
tralians must soon be called upon to decide
whether they will range themselves under
an Imperial banner, or, on the other hand,
lay the foundations of’a lusty Confederation
of the South. Already Imperialism is actively
working to secure these colonies as recruits
for her forces. Such Governors as Lord
Carington and Sir H. B. Loch are the re-
cruiting-sergeants of the Empire; they
appear in a gorgeous Imperial guise calcu-
lated to arouse a hankering for glory attain-
able by active service under the same Sove-
reign ; and the Queen’s shilling in the shape
of Privy Council honours, which are not
titles, and titles such as knighthoods and
C.M.G.-ships, which are not honours, are will-
ingly given to those persons whose sympa-
thies it is deemed necessary to secure. Rose-
bery wires anhysterioal “ W ell-donel ” Wales
shakes hands with wealthy Australian tal-
low-smelters, pig-butchers, and whiskey-
sellers; the Queen invites the same distin-
guished visitors to lunch; and an append-
age to royalty, in the shape ot a prince or
a pensioner, is to come out to open the
Adelaide Exhibition—all for the cause of
Imperialism. There is a conspiracy to seize
Australia as a captive to increase the vainly-
foreshadowed triumphs of a gigantic and
aggressive British Empire. Dazzled by the
glitter of imagined glories, there are many
men in Australia who do not hesitate to
act as traitors to the land they inhabit by
joining in the conspiracy. To this end Mr.
Dalley sent forth a handful of hireling
nigger-butchers ; post-prandial orators act
as frothy special-pleaders for Imperia l ism
Jingo editors spread their epileptic frenzy
over leaders remarkable only for bathos and
empty boastings ; Slatterys make ridi-
culous and high-flown orations in the House
to which Abigails give grateful applause—
and Mr. A. P. Can away writes a 49-page
pamphlet on “Our Fathers and our Im-
perial Rights.”
■ ■ ■
Were it not for the rapidly-increasing im-
portance of the question of Imperial Union,
this brochure by Mr. Cana way would be
sufficiently noticed by a two-line paragraph,
for it contains many grave inaccuracies,
very little of argument, and is indefinite
even beyond the generality of deliverances
on the same subject; but it is the theme,
not its eluoidator, which demands notice.
We must weigh the plaintiff’s case, however
contemptible the utterance of the advocate
may appear. The pamphlet is divided in
accordance with its title, and may be most
easily treated in the same’ manner. Mr.
Canaway takes much trouble in discuss-
ing the genealogy ot Britons to prove that
the inhabitants of the United Kingdom,
whom he calls “Inner British,” are of the
same speech and descent, whether residing in
England, Ireland, or Scotland. This is either
a commonplace fact, or a manifest error,
according to the interpretation which it is
made to bear. If this means that the 'same
elements are to be traced in each pro-
vince, the statement is true enough,
but of no tangible importance; if, how-
ever, it be taken to indicate that
the elements are present in anything
like corresponding proportions, evident and
well-known facts array themselves in oppo-
sition to the assumption. Yet this argu-
ment, worthless as it must be in either
case, is held to justify the abolition of the
Irish Parliament. “The Union,” says our
author, “was in fine carried and was ac-
cepted because seasonably expressive of the
high political truth of the unity of the
British people; and the truth then so
solemnly put on record cannot now by any
vulgar (!) expedients of agitation be brought
into serious dispute.” There is a tine old
Tory flavour about this blast. It matters not
that the truth was put on record by bribery,
corruption, treachery, and trickery of the
grossest kind. Truth, according to Tory
ideas, is never more effective than when
driven in with the bayonet, or gilded with a
bribe; and it is gratifying to know that this
corrupt union cannot be brought into “ seri-
ous dispute ” by the “ vulgah ” agitation of
a Gladstone. Such being the case, we
THE LATE REV. JAMES FULLERTON, LL.B,
must believe that the general election, as
well as all the reported debates in the House
of Commons over the Home Rule Bill, did
not really occur at all. They are mere
myths of a sensation-mongering Press.
* • •
Besides decreeing that Home Rule cannot
be granted to Ireland because its people are
the same by speech and descent as the other
British, Mr. Can a way extends his argument
to this Continent and endeavours to make it
prove the necessity of our Imperial Union
with the other parts of the Empire. “The
Australian,” he says, “is the Briton
thoroughbred.” A mind inclined to levity
might naturally enquire here whether a
tinge of the, Mongolian blood, a dash of the
Teutonic strain, and a soupcon of the French
is necessary to the creation of a “Briton
thoroughbred,” but we are not now con-
cerned with such unimportant points. We
do not venture to remind Mr. Canawat
that British blood has in the mass
been much mixed on this continent. It is
easier to grant his premises and to investi-
gate the extraordinary conclusion he obtains
therefrom, which is thus stated:—“The
most pregnant incident of a people’s oneness
is its competency to be politically united
into one State, a thing achieved, as afore-
said, by the Germans and Italians. There-
fore the British people is, in theory, capable
of Union into one State.” The “Union”
instanced is worthy of the argument. The
Italians and Germans never were one people
in any sense of the word. They differed in
descent, speech, interests, habits, customs,
and feature, and were never politically
united at any period of their history. They
were certainly at one time nominally under
one tyrant, which may be the high Tory idea
of political union, but for all practical pur-
poses were still separate nations. The one
link which bound them was oppression by the
stronger nation. When the weaker people
were enabled to shake off the yoke they
gladly did so, although at a heavy cost,
“ The accession of Konrad,” says an ency-
clopaedic writer, “ was the signal for various
tumultous risings of the Italians against
their German rulers, who had become the
object of general detestation.” This refers
to that sanctified political union .he Ger-
mans and Italians so eloquently described
by our gifted Imperialist, and eulogised in-
as a model for Australians. Yet
the instance is fairly suitable for applioa-
tion to the present subject. The oneness of
the Biitish and ourselve* which really does
not exist, would cause, by its absence, simi-
lar detestation if such a political union were
formed. Queen Victobia would, like
Otho 1., be the monarch ruling over the
two peoples, and the weaker nation, Aus-
tralia, would meekly and loyally endure
the yoke of Imperial oppression—until we
were able to throw it off.
* * a
Dazzled by supposed glories of ancestry
always a source of boastful pride to a l*ory,
Mr. CanaWat refuses to admit any other
reason for political union, and asserts union
to be absolutely necessary to those, where-
ever situate, who use the same speech and
are of the same descent. Our contention la
directly opposed to these assumptions. We
hold community of interest and aim to be
the one indispensable condition of political
union. If, for instance, all Scotchmen were
Radicals, all Irishmen Liberals, and all En-
glishmen Tories, separation or conquest
would be the certain result. Similarly a close
union of England and Australia would pro-
duce, sooner or later, disastrous consequences.
Both in aim and interest Australians differ
from inhabitants of the United Kingdom.
In these Colonies there are a very large
number—a very large proportion, even—of
Republicans; besides these, many of the best
citizens have come out, or their fathers have
come out to escape the keen miseries of star-
vation ; and a large proportion have emis
grated to escape the class tyranny of older
lands. How would any of these per-
sons, nearly all of whom have gained
prosperity and influence beneath a freer
sky, meet any attempt to again fasten Upon
them the rule which they abhor ? It Is not
necessarily the Australian natives who arb
most truly patriotic to their Australian
liberties. Many Englishmen Who have only
recently arrived would be amdng the fore-
most to protest against any infringement
of the liberties they now enjoy by rheans
of any system of Imperial Union. He is the
truest Australian who loves Australian privi-
leges best. On these grounds Thb Bcti/lutin
denounced that monument of political snob-
bery, the “ Australian Natives’ Association.’*
Australians [approve themselves, such by
their devotion to our own national liberties
and rights. The resident of any of these
colonies whose heart is set upon that Egyp-
tian flesh-pot—lmperial glory—is a foreigner
and a traitor, although he may be a native
of the soil. No possible incident of union
could bring our interest-born national
thoughts into harmony with those prevail-
ing in England; and no advantage gained
could in any way atone for the loss of rights
of [legislation and liberties assured under
our respective Parliaments. Australian
progress will not submit to be bound by the
chains of an alien Toryism. Colonial Con-
servatives are more pliant and progressive
than: English] Radicals ; Colonial Councils,
despite all their vices, more Liberal than
the English Commons; to yoke the two
nations would be to couple the horse and
the ox in the same team. Each ham-
pering the operations, and, chafing at the
methods of the other, would endure the
companionship only so long as the tackling
was strong enough to hold them together
* * «
Imperialists of the Cana wav type do not
seem to consider, and will not deign to dis-
cuss, the solid sacrifices Australia must make
in order to obtain this wreath of Imperial
glory. Political union of the whole Empire
would necessitate, in the first place, assimi-
lation of tariffs, and this alone is an almost
prohibitive requirement. If Victoria has to
choose between Protection and Imperial
union, she will almost certainly retain the
former; and when the inhabitants of any
of the Colonies have to elect between Home
and Foreign Rule, they will, upon being

dependence, but it is impossible that this
Continent can again be brought into sub-
jection. “ Our Imperial Rights,” according
to the second portion of Mr. Canaway’s
pamphlet, would seem to consist chiefly of a
right, which we may assert at our pleasure,
of taking part in old-world squabbles and
obtaining glory thereby. Such “ rights,” of
inestimable value from a Tory point of view,
possess no charms for those who admire the
nobler triumphs of peaoe, the victories in
the work of national redemption. After
carefully reading that part of Mr. Cana-
way’s book dealing, in magniloquent but
distressingly vague descriptions, with these
“ Imperial Rights,” we are still inclined to
believe that, measured by his description,
they are not worth as much as would have
purchased a mid-day meal for the Soudan
goat.

America, according to this author, is a
fearful example which Australia would do
well to avoid. “ Tin niggardliness of
Nature” he says, “forbids Australia to
follow the United States. If she follows
their pulioy (which God avert!) (sic), she
cannot have their growth ; and if she ambi-
tions (sic) an equal growth, she must not
follow their policy.” And this is his idea of
the Americans:—
“At the beginning of their national life, and in
pursuance of their policy, they abdicated the
right* of British men, and slighted the bond of
descent and speech: they took up with the rights
of man— [How wrocgl— Ed. B]—and relied on the
bond of material interest. The policy has still its
last word to say; the resources and area of the
territory have hitherto sufficed for all the popula-
tion ; the hour of strain and distress has yet to
coma. But even now (if facts and authorities
speaktrue) there is such a want of aim and aspira-
tion pervading their national life as denies to the
Americans the true exaltation of greatness. If
Imagination were here in place, one might com-
pare them to some disorbed star which, blazing and
splendidly refulgent though it gleam, yet, having
onoe, m disdain of the slow and majestic wheeling
of its native-appointed system, shot out of it to
take the trackless void, now circles through the
firmament, all restless and unpnrpoaed, joyless and
alone.”
This, as a sample of Imperial twaddle, is
really very fine. There is also a haughty
disregard of realities about it, together
with a fide touch of romance, which is cal-
culated to enhance the cause of Imperialists
very considerably. But even with these
beauties Mr. Can away is to be commended
for having—possibly from sheer thoughtless-
ness-loaded his soaring fancies with just a
few grains of truth. It is true, for instance,
that America took up with the rights of
man—rights which England’s! ruling classes
have ooatinuously outraged; it is true,
also, that America’s hour of strain and dis-
tress has yet to come, while England’s
period of misery has already spread itself
over a full century; and It is also a faot
that the American star is “blazing and
splendidly refulgent,” while that of Eng-
land is rapidly and surely declining. But,
admitting these truths, we; take strong ex-
ception to the remainder of the passage.
The inference which Mr. Canawat wishes
us to drawls that the exaltation of national
greatness ca,n only be achieved by drawing
inspiration from Imperial Britain. This is
Toryism in excelsis. We believe that Eng-
land has achieved a large measure of great-
ness, but to assert that she has a divine
monopoly of that commodity is to contra-
dict all the facts of the world’s history.
• m *
i Mr. Cana way is an M.A. of Oxford, he
may, therefore, be supposed to know some-
thing of England, but his knowledge of
Australia seems to consist mainly of miscon-
ceptions. Of this Continent he writes :
“ She is without water. Nature has left her dry
and unrefreshed -a son-struck soil too drouth y for
the farmers husbandry. . . . Her Govern-
ments have given railways (nine-tenths built with
borrowed capital), but the limit of public credit
looms visible ahead, and the country remains un-
watered as before and pastoral perforce. A
pastoral population must be scattered, therefore
small, and therefore needing few to manufacture
for it. Industrial pursuits for the mass of the
population are not seriously to be yet thought of
In Australia; climate apart, its home market must
readily be glutted, and a foreign market cannot
be found. The only question is grass or corn,
sheep or men; and because sheep cannot uphold a
State, Australia’s path of progress is to water.”
We quote this in full, in order to show
what ignorance of the country in which he
lives, a man assisted by his preconceptions
may acquire. WUere is there mention here of
the almost untouched mineral deposits of
Australia—what of the huge stores of iron,
coal, gold, tin, copper, and other minerals,
discovered and undiscovered ? Not suited
for the farmer’s husbandry ? How then are
the shiploads of exported wheat obtained ?
The whole passage is eloquent of ignorance.
Mr. Canaway unintentionally admits that
he knows nothing of Australia, and every
page of his book snows that he regards Im-
perial glory as the one thing to be desired
by this Australian nation. Thus the mental
forces which he brings to bear upon the
question of Australia’s destiny, are ignor-
ance of Australian natural resources and
condition, and sentiments and aspirations
alike foreign to this Continent. He is not
an Australian, although, for aught we know,
he may be native-born. Under these cir-
cumstances, his inflated exhortation to Aus-
tralians may be mildly described as an
imoertinence. Ah Chung Eat, ifle Mongo-
lian, might, with equal propriety, advocate
a union of Australia and Cnma, and mignt,
if be could not find anything better, use all
the arguments of the pamphlet with equal—
certainly not less—effect. As a special-
pleader for Imperialism, Mr. Canaway is
not a success; as a writer for and adviser of
Australians in national matters he must he
accounted a dismal failure.
A Side-Light on the Present British
General Election.
Land Monopoly.—How Long will it Last ?
We reprint below an article by Adam Badeau, of
New York, describing the condition of Scotland,
the most nobility-rid den country in the world.
Mr. Gladstone is reported by reoeut cablegrams to
have remarked, in the course of a speech delivered
during the late British general election, that
Scotland and Ireland Lad done their duty and had
stood by him, for they had learnt their lesson ; It
was now for England slowly and painfully to
learn hers. With the Instruction In national
misery suggestively sketched in this article, it
seems improbable that Scotland will take long In
attaining the standard of political education ne-
cessary for the emancipation of her pauper mil-
lions. Old traditions and superstitions have long
availed to enslave those who should be free, but
it Is certain that oppression will not be able now
for long to postpone the advance of freedom. The
following, according to Badeau, is the condition of
the masses under the rule of the British aris-
tocracy:—
" Scotland is the paradise of the peers. The
county of Sutherland contains 1,399,353 acres. of
which the Duke of Sutherland owns 1,176,343. The
population of the oountv is 34,317 souls. Six other
potentates hold over 100,000 acres among them,
leaving exactly 5395 acres for the remaining 34,310
inhabitants. There are, however, only 85 of these
with more than an acre apiece.
“ Among the other great proprietors in Scotland
are the Duchess of Sutherland, who owns an estate
of 149,000 acres In her own right, and the Earl of
Fife, who has one of 140,000; another of 73 , .00O l , and
another of 40 GOO. The Duke of Richmond has one
of 155.000, and another of 69.000; the Earl of Sea-
field (the head of the Grants), one of 93,000, one of
48.000, and one of 16,C00; the Earl of Breadalbane
owns 193,000 and 179,000 acres; the Duke of Hamil-
ton. 103,000 and 45 000; the Duke of Buccleugb,
353.000, 104,000, and 60,000. The Duke of Argyll is
comparatively poor; he Owns only 168,000 acres,
while the Queen’s estate of Balmoral Is a modest
little property of 35,000 acres. In Inverness-shire
30 men own 3,000,000 acres among them, and in
Aberdeenshire 33 ‘lords and gentlemen ’ own more
than half the county, though the population is
344.000, The greater part of all this territory is
devoted to the sports of the aristocracy, for whom
Scotland is only one great playground.
“ Three-fourths of these noble landlords inherit
rhelr estates either from grasping robbers of the
Norman ‘.type or Cromwellian conquest, or from
women who sold their beauty and their virtue to
kings or panders, or from politicians of the stamp
of Aaron Burr or Alderman Jaehne. Walpole and
Pitt were the most lavish distributors of coronets
England ever had, and one of these notoriously
bought with money and titles the very Irish
Union which is certain soon to be dissolved, while
the other was the author of the famous maxim in
English politics; ‘ Every man has bis price.’
“ The great landowners themselves seldom cul-
tivate more than a little piece of soil, sufficient for
the requirements of a single establishment. The
arable and pasture land of the k'ngdom is let
out to 1,160,000 tenant farmers, 70 per cent, of
whom hold less than 50 acres each, 13 per cent,
between 50 and 100 acres, and only 18 per cent,
more than 100 acres apiece. In all the kingdom
only 600 farms exceed 1000 acres in extent. Many
of the farmers are little better off than their own
labourers, but In the aggregate they employ a
capital of £400,000,000. With the labourers they
constitute one-tenth of the working population of
the country.
" The labourers have no capital butthe furniture
of their dwellings, unless the strength of their
bodies and the hard experience of toil may be-
considered capital. Their wages are insufficient to
maintain them, and the consequence is there are
a million of paupers to be supported by the State.
They have, of course, no Independence, but are
in reality serfs of the soil. They rarely leave the
parish in which they were born; until recently, if
they did so, they forfeited the right to relief
when destitute, or to the almshouse, which every
peasant looks to as the end of his labourlous life.
They never save; they have insufficient food; in
many parts of the country their stature is dwarfish,
their gait slow and sluggish, like their minds.
They have no education; thelrjonly pleasure is
drink. Above all, they have no possibility of bet-
tering themselves. But it is upon their poverty,
degradation, and misery, that the grandeur and
luxury of the aristocracy are founded. One is the
direct cause of the other.
In ',lBBO, the average wages of the agricultural
labourer, the man who worked the two thousand
million acres of land, and produced the three hun-
dred and thirty millions of revenue, was 14s. a
week. Out of this he had to pay his rent to the
earl or the duke, which was 3s. Bread was Hi. a
pound, meat (93., and butter Is. 83. So his 3s. a
day would not buy many pounds of meat or
butter, If the family was large. For there were
shoes to be got for all, clothes, fuel, lights as well
as food, all out of 14s. a week, and in sight of the
castle of my lord, who was rich solely because the
hind was poor.
“ The ordinary cottage of the English labourer
has but two rooms, and when the married man has
a family of nearly or quite grown sons and
daughters they often all sleep in one room, and
not unfrequently in the same bed. The great
majority of cottages are wretchedly built, often
on ivery unhealthy sites, miserably small, very
low, badly drained, and they scarcely ever have a
cellar or a space under the roof above the room on
the lower floor. They are fit abodes for a pea-
santry pauperised and demoralised by the utter
helplessness of their condition.
“ The first summer that I spent In England I
visited two splendid mansions In the south whose
owners were earls. One of these showed me a
hail in his castle that was restored in the time of
Henry V., and the other was of the family of that
Count Robert of Paris who sat for awhile on the
throne of Constantinople. Both of these nobles
were personally estimable, and even religious
men, who undoubtedly supposed they were doing
their duty in that state of life to which it had
pleased God to call them. I knew of exalted and
beautiful traits in the character of each that
would extort the admiration of honourable men
everywhere.
“ While I was visiting them, I attended the
meetings of the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, held in a neighbouring
town. Large parties went in each day from the
palatial and luxurious abodes of the nobility, to be
present at the sessions, at which the earl presided,
and nearly a .'score of high-placed proprietors at-
tended what interested me most of all, the sittings
of the Department of Political and Social
Economy. The magnates were engaged for
several days discussing the condition of the Eng-
lish poor. I heard viscounts and baronets and
bishops and earls lamenting the misery and de-
pravity, the poverty and low wages of the
wretches who lived on their estates. I heard them
admit that in their part of the country a shilling a
day was often the wages of a strong, healthy man,
who had a wife and six or seven children to sup
port, out of which, 1 heard them say, at least a
shilling a week was deducted for rent. I heard
that whole families occupied a single bedroom. I
heard of the ignorance and stolidity often the
brutality, of the English peasants, of whom there
are several millions.
“’Not all are in this extreme condition, but all
are degraded and demoralised ; and I have heard
English noblemen declare that, as a class, they are
more brutish—that was the word—than any other
peasantry In the world. The worst things I have
told are neither exceptional nor rare. I went
back to' the stately halls, where 40 or 50 guests
were feasted each night off of silver, and waere
the very servants were ten times better fed and
clad and housed than the best of the lower class
outside ; where the poor crowded around the
charitable kitchen g ate, literally glad to feed on
the qpumbs that fell from the rich man’s table ;
and I wondered what would be the end—and how
long it would be deferred—of the aristocracy of
England 1 ”
How long will it last? It will last until the
despised and oppressed labourers learn that they
have rights, and power to enforce them. Then
the end will come perhaps In fire and blood, per-
haps by radical Parliamentary reform—and tnen
the freed British serf will wonder why he endured
bondage so long, and patiently.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Blockheads’ Blockade.
Anything more senseless or disgraceful to the
responsible parties than the stonewalling last week
in the New South Wales Assembly cannot be found
upon the past records of that nuver too dignified
Assembly. The degrading struggle began without
reason, continued without decency, culminated in
rowdyism, and concluded in cant. From first to
last the proceedings were destitute of anything
that can be applauded. The course of conduct
varied only from bad to outrageous, from vile to
viler still. Upon the Opposition the odium of the
affair must be cast. Their aim was hopeless from
the first ; they could not hope to prevail,
and endurance in obstruction only betrayed
their malignity. The desperation of the strug<
gle, and the bitterness with which It was
carried on, cannot be accounted for by any of the
stated grounds of obstruction. No question of
principle was Involved, the liberties of the people
were not In any way endangered, nor was the
legislation proposed, such as to evoke any con-
siderable interest on the part of the public. As a
matter of fact, the question, outside the House
and the dally newspaper offices, is looked upon
with Indifference by the very large majority of
those whom its decision will affect, and members
are fully aware of this fact. Had the issue been
comprised In the question of ad valorem duties
alone, the debate might have been finished
within 13 hours. But bigotry brought its weight
to bear upon the question. Orangemen have long
viewed with impotent anger the Catholic represen-
tation in the Cabinet. They burned with silent
hate when the coooanut-01l contingent were
baulked in their New Hebrides scheme by the
moderate action of Sir Patrick Jennings, and
they hoped to secure a revenge for that rebuff by
getting the Freetraders to join with them in a
wild attempt at humiliating a Government
which they were utterly unable to defeat.
The Eiama Ghost has been again raised, the
Yellow Dog has howled with all his vicious energy,
but the degradation of the House generally has
been the only result. With the approach of the
13ch of July, the bigots determined to distinguish
themselves somehow. The red-rag of Catholicism
was on the Treasury Benches, and at it the Orange
Bull charged, but only to retire with broken horns
and bleeding face. If Sir Patrick Jennings had
ever within our knowledge.during his Premiership,
showed that his religion Interfered with his duty
to the country, we would unhesitatingly Impeach
him of the political crime. But we know of no sin
of this nature, and, therefore, congratulate him
upon his victory of last week, and only regret
that he showed so little of grace in its accomplish-
ment. His excuse must be that, insulted by the
insolence of his opponents, he was moved to assert
his victory more strongly than he would other-
wise have done.
" Bats!”
“ The worst rogue makes the holiest saint,” and
similarly the fiercest of all Freetraders Is the
renegade Protectionist, There was a time—and
not so very long ago, either—when the Sydney
Daily Telegraph whined piteously for protec-
tion of native Industries, hut since It forsook that
policy no journal has more hysterically howled for
Freetrade. From the tenor and tone of its leaders,
and the venom with which It attacks all who
favour the proposed Increases of the New Sou th
Wales Custom Duties, It would seem that the
D.T. regards consistent Freetrade as the one
essential of National salvation. No epithets
are too abusive for those who favour t T ae
ad valorem duties, and no sin possible "*to* those
who delay their Imposition. Even Sir 'Heni ;y
Parkes, who, but a short time back was freely
anathematised, has worked out his political r e-
demption in the eyes of this franzlgd daily; and
even poor little Abigail longer despised
and abused. The Daily Telegraph, which “ re-
grets,” too, that it“has hitherto under-rated” Jaw-
bone Neild> is the only Sydney paper which" has
ventured to disgrace itself by applauding tl»e
stupid, aimless, and brutal exhibition of Par-
liamentary larrikinisna of "last week, and th«e
members of the Opposition, who were responsible
for it. If any principle were Involved, we might
be able to discover a reason for this editorial
fury, but it Is impossible to pretend that
this la the Protection Is a questisn
not of principle, but of circumstance. We have
supported Protection because it is calculated,
when judiciously applied, to give an impetus to the
progress of the country; if, however, the circum-
stances of New South Wales were such as to
render Freetrade the more beneficial policy, we
would advocate its adoption without doing .vio-
lence to any guiding principle of national politics.
But even supposing that there were a principle
Involved, it has been already affirmed by the im-
position of duties which the Telegraph appar-
ently desires to be maintained. Sugar-growers are
amply protected under the existing tariff, so are
brewers, baeon-curers, kerosene-oil distillers,
and-thousands of other operatives. If Sydney
were an absolutely free port there might be some
sense in the fury 'of the renegade D.T., but the
duties now sought.to bepmppsed only add slightly
to the burden of taxation already, borne,by the
consumer, and give the manufacturer a little
more encouragement thin he has recently re-
ceived. To object to the new duties, while
favouring the retention of those already collected*
and stating the ohjection'to be one of “ principle,’
is the baldest inconsistency. And if it be hypo-
critically answered that the present dutiea are only
incidentally protective, and were imposed for
revenue purposes, the evident reply is the
same qualities adhere to the new schedules, over
which so much fuss is being made. Some oftha
proposed tolls will not give the slightest en-
couragement to local industries. This is frce y
admitted. Would the D.T., then support such
and oppose only those which confer a benefit upon
manufacturers and their hands ? To do so would
be more reasonable than to join them all together In
one common condemnation. To sjy that the
country has not had a chance of deciding this ques-
tlon, and la opposed to ad valorem duties, is an airy
item of romance. At last election 37 more or less
pronounced Protectionists were returned, and as
many more asserted themselves favourable to the
encouragement of local Industries. And It is cer-
tain that every elector wishes to tee the debts of
the country paid. After much consideration of
the question, we cannot discover why the Tele-
graph should go “on the rampage ” with such
vehement energy. The " blockheads’ blockade ”
we account for by the operation of blind bigotry
and fanatical fury. Surely the Telegraph has
not also allied itself with the “Klama Ghost ”
party ?
*
Parkes and the Yellow Pup.
The Orangemen of New South Wales must be
about the meanest and most servlle'set of men that
ever owned hearts wherewith to hate. They
raised Sir Henry Parkes up a few months ago
from the very dust, and made him to be a leader
of their party in the Assembly. Grateful for the
favour, he immediately retorted by dragging the
party through the mud of humiliation, publicly
approving of Home Rule, which the Orangemen
abhor, and was only prevented from attending
the meeting commending Gladstone’s policy, by
the intervention of Divine Providence, assisted, as
it is said, by Frawncis Habiglb. Then, when
the Revs. Madqwick, Barnier, FRaclkleton
Barry, Oram, and other fervent firebrands held
their annual meeting for the promotion of sec-
tarian hatred, he lounged in with a nonchalant
air, and when called upon to speak, professed
ignorance of the aims of Orangemen, refused to
become one of them, and showed his utter con-
tempt for the whole proceedings by Insolent chaff
and sarcasm hidden only by the thinnest of veils;
and yet they will continue to support him. He
has kicked the Yellow Pup; he has thrown Home
Rule stones at it; he is asked to acknowledge his
ownership of it, and he flatly declines. Poverty,
stricken for want of power, It Is afflicted with the
mange of public contempt, and, although the ap-
proving words of Parkes would act as an oint-
ment to remove the affliction, Parkes refuses to
apply that remedy. He will not even allow
it [to be registered in his name, so for want
of a license it sneaks through the town
liable at any time to be “ run in ”by the police of
public opinion, and boiled down in the cauldron
of contumely. Yet, with all this, PaAKes does not
refuse to sustain his political importance by trea-
suring up the bones, in the shape of the votes of
Foster, NeilD, and 00., which the despised
Yellow Pup is able to steal. From a careful re-
view of the position of both parties, we are
inclined to consider that the dog is adapted to the
master, and the master a suitable owner for the
dog. They have many points in common, and In
their present attitudes are about equally worthy
of admiration, as far as political conduct Is con-
cerned.

Cui Bono?
Whether the persons indicted for alleged frauds
In connection with the railways of New South
Wales are guilty or not, Is relatively a small ques-
tion beside that which concerns the Innocence or
otherwise of Government officials who permitted
the Department to remain at the mercy of con-
signors and carriers of goods. It has been stated,
without contradiction so far, that there has never
been any check upon the weights of goods, such as
wool, forwarded from country stations. The
weight and freight were left, it Is said, to the
person loading the bales or parcels. Such being
the case. It falls upon the officials to explain
who was the fool or knave who knowingly per-
mitted such a state of things to continue. It may
be that the Inferior clerks were responsible, or
the blame may even rest with high officials.
Knowing that such opportunities for fraud
existed, the public will'believe that frauds were
at one time or another consummated. Not, per-
haps, by the parties now accused, who may all be
innocent as the day, but certainly by some per-
sons. And believing that, the enquiry will be,
“Cuibono ? To whom were these universal con-
fidence arrangements on the railway, a profitable
thing ? ”

the bold William’s thoughts were far, far away.
In imagination, maybe, he was scoring 1000, not
out and accepting the congratulations of the

tude very likely were ringing—but, anyway, he
lost that county court case for his client.
Oue of the numerous church-reporters of
that “good” paper, theS.A. Advertiser, stated
that a local clergyman, in preaching the funeral-
sermon of the late Dean Russell, “chose for the
basis of hla discourse the 3rd verse of the 20th
chapter of Revelation.” Now it happens that that
verse reads in this way—“ And cast him into the
bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
unon him, that he should deceive the nations no
more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled,
and after that he must be loosed a little season.”
There seems to be a mistake somewhere here-
abouts.
It is now cabled that “ the Duke of Con-
naught is being urged to visit Australia and open

the exhibition-promoters are holding a sort of

Prince of Wales ; presently they went down on
their marrow-bones to Connaught, the hero who
so gallantly “ held the guards in reserve” at the
battue of T J-el-Kebir, while the other troops were
slaughtering the miserable Egyptians. The Ade-
laide exhibition people are getting very low.

rough and tumble of station life on the Murray,
before Beechworth was a village. He was one
of those essentially, honest, good-natured, true
men, whose lives, despite all care, seem always
rippled with a perennial smile, and his last
thoughts were of a new newspaper venture,
which would have brought him profit, but the
accomplishment of which the Great Reaper pro-

infidels. He prosed away to this small congrega-

God’s sake, give us an argument.” Long quoted
this as proving that even so-called atheists believe
in a Deity In their hearts. But most men would
rather have let the Illustration go to the distant
land of Shinar, or further still, than acknowledge
that in all London they could only muster an
audience of eight.
The Bat, a London paper, mildly sizes up

and all got drunk together. “Personally,” he
says, “I have no affection for colonists. Either
they are descended from convicts, and inherit
their manners, or else they emigrated from the
mother country because they were no good here;
but, to their credit, let me admit that, with one
exception, they made themselves unobjectionable
on Thursday night.” The Bat is evidently an
authority on the manners and customs of convicts.
Perhaps it never dawns on this scribe that people
leave England now-a-days, not because they are
no good there, but because the mother country,
Victoria, John Brown, Wales, and all the rest are
about played out.
Thomas Ranson, a Melbourne eabby of
patriarchal aspect, was summoned last week for
leaving his charger uncared ior with nothing but
its infirmities to prevent it from dashing off and
committing slaughter in the streets. At first it
seemed as if Thomas would have to live apart
from his family for a week or two, till someone
told the Dench that many years ago he was an
orderly—a Governor's orderly— think of that!
Then the “ loyal ” Bench uprose and tearfully dis-
missed Thomas with a blessing, because of bis
former distinguished servlets to the State, and
now he is justly at liberty, if he pleases, to drive
on both sides of the road at once, gallop over
crossings, tear a constable’s uniform, and drink
on Sundays. A movement Is on foot amongst
Adelaide aldermen to get him over to open the
forthcoming Exhibition.
The Queen has taken a private box for the

A passion for inspecting as much of her fellow-
creatures as possible seems to be Implanted in the
royal bosom. In the old times it was said that the
young Queen never took her glasses off the lovely
danseuses. In these latter days the matured
monarch has developed a positive mania for see-
ing all women in short sleeves and low bodices,
while, as regards the opposite sex, a short kilt is
the surest passport to Royal favour. The only
pathetic passages in “ Leaves from my Diary” are
those relating to “ poor Brown’s logs.”
Charles Bush, the eminent English sport-
ing man who took Trickett under his wing when
the latter rowed Sadler, is dead. The boat In
which Trickett rowed his first race for the
championship was the “ Charles Bush.” Mr. Bush,
well remembered as “ the clean-shaved man in the
white hat,” was at one time a most successful
bookmaker, and 20 years ago must have been
pocketing £IO,COO a year; but he made the mistake
of leaving his legitimate groove, and so met
adversity half way. His purse was always open,
and he never knew how to refuse a sponger
asking for a loan, nor had any man of his means
ever so many pensioners living upon him. They
ate up his substance, and it may fairly be said
that a better or more kind-hearted man was never
known in connection with the betting-ring.
While Maxwell (arrested at Auckland,
N.Z.), the cold-blooded and convicted murderer of
his travelling-companion, Preller, was on trial for
his life at St. Louis, he “mashel the women in the
court all the time.” We read that “ even when the
trunk was brought in (tho same reeking, ghastly
receptacle that had contained Preller’s body) for
identification—while Manioc, a porter, described
the appearance of Preller’s body, the manner in
which he was startled when the right leg of the
corpse flew up as the trunk lid was thrown open,
the attitude of the head crowded into one corner
and the frightful discoloration of the remains—
even while Manion was reciting all this horrible
story, Maxwell’s attention was given to a peaceful
and somewhat charming little lady in blue who
sat at one side with her cloak thrown back over
her shoulders and wore a hat that came near ob-
scuring her eyes.
“ Lord Carington,” says the Kapunda (8. A )
He ral n , *■ is understood to be—not at all to his
discredit—the original of that delectable song
‘ Ooampagne Charlie.’ The story goes that he was
away down in the lower counties hunting with his
bosom friend the Prince of Wales, and that they
were accompanied by a well-known musical com-
poser whom the prince delighted in at that time.
Carington was a cheerful bon vivant, and his
familiar title In that august company was ‘ Charlie.’
In the course of luncheon he remarked, jocularly,
tilting a glass, ‘Champagne Charlie is my name/
and the composer immortalised the words. It
was Lord Carington, too, who, not without provo-
cation, horsewhipped Grenville Murray, the bitter
writer of * Society in London,’ and one of the first
proprietors of the World. Lord Carington has
the reputation of being a genial, kindly soul-not
at all a bad fellow, for a lord.”
A N.Z. country butcher, one day, lately,,
was wrestling with his books in the endeavour to
ascertain how much poverty he had accumulated
during the year. “Hang it,” he said, ‘‘l never
sausage a muddle as I’ve got into with them
Aggers. They don’t seem to chop up right, any-
how.” Then he scratched his head with bis mag-
num bonum, and perplexedly stood in his shop-
door. Presently he saw a stranger approach, and,
in bis despair, he asked him if he " knowed
a ythlng about Aggers,” The stranger said he
did a little, and enquired how he could help him.
The butcher explained, and the two went into the
back shop and tackled the difficulty. In a short
time the stranger discovered where the mis-steaks
were, and soon bad the balance-sheet ready for
the butcher’s banker’s inspection—showing, of
course, a handsome surplus. Greatly relieved, the
butcher asked the stranger how much he was In
his debt. “ Oh, nothing,” was the reply. “ I have
often a difficulty with figures myself. Good day.”
The stranger departed, and just as he went out a
neighbour dropped in. “ Who is that?” asked
the butcher, pointing to the departing financier.
“ Oh, that’s Major Atkinson, our late Colonial
Treasurer,” replied the neighbour, “ and a boss
hand at figures, too, you bet.”
Miss Maud Bransoombe, a young lady
whose face is familiar to us in the photographers’
windows, got married the other day to the man
who plays the piano for her pettifogging show
round the English provincial towns. We observe
that the London paragraph has been seized upon
by Australian papers, wherein Maud Branscombe
is described as “the celebrated beauty.” They
got that idea from the imported photographs.
Many, many, many years ago we remember being
deluded in the same way by those fraudulent pic-
tures. Maud Bransoombe clinging to a cross,
with her back hair all over the place, seemed the
realisation of our young dreams of feminine love-
liness. She was depicted in a hundred other posi-
tions, and looked paralysing in every one of them.
We might have gone on worshipping Maud till
now if we hadn’t seen her in the flesh and in the
street. Ah, what a day of disenchantment was
that! The spirituelle phiz, of the shop windows
was puny and insipid, and as for her figure—well,
you might put the whole lot of Miss Branscombe
into a lunch-tin. She’s something less than petite.
It pains us to make these disclosures, for we know
that Maud has many adorers all over Australasia.
We have seen ardent youths gazing at her 1 air (or
rather, unfair) presentment in a George-ntreet
show-case with the same misguided delight that
we experienced about the time they were born.
But as a hard, bitter lesson to the drivelling dallies
we feel it our duty to take an affidavit that Maud
Bransoombe is not a “celebrated beauty.” No
C.M.G.’s tombstone ever lied with more unblush-
ing effrontery than that young woman’s übiqui-
tous photo.
The Prince of Wales has been taken in
hand by a Melbourne “phrenologist.” This
“phrenologist” contributed columns of dreary
platitudes to the Herald about public characters
and their bumps. He tells admiring readers that
James Service is in his (the phrenologist’s) estima-
tion suited for bossing a Government and develop-
ing Imperial Federation—that Graham Berry was
cut out for an Agent-General and knighthood—
and that Peter Lalor has the exact cranium re-
quired to qualify a man for the position of Speaker.
Now that he has used up all tne local stars, this
artful magician is about to grind out fresh
columns about European Royalties. Just at this
juncture he felt Australia was panting to hear
about the Prince of Wales. So the oracle has
spoken. Having bought a large full-face photo-
graph of Bertie, and passed his hand carefully
over the bumps at the back of the royal head, the
phrenologist has come to the conclusion that this
Prince is not “ strictly moral.” Nevertheless, we
are not to think badly of Bertie. And in order
that we may not be led astray by wicked, idle
tales, this delectable twaddler gives his readers a
valuable hint. With superior scorn, he asks—** In
estimating the character of our Prince, have we
to accept the statement of the Court journals, or
go to the Press of the gutter ? Have we to ques-
tion the Court Circular ? ” No, enlightened
critic, a thousand times no I The Court Circular
shall be our Bible in matters appertaining to
Royalty. We will treasure up the blessed truths
written therein, and learn to reverence our
Princes and Princesses as we used to reverence
our God. We repent of past transgressions in ac-
centing such gutter literature as Thackeray’s
“Pour Georges.” In order to estimate the
character of George IV., we will look up the Court
journals of his period.

Political
Points
Justin M‘Carthy has again been narrowly
defeated—by three votes. Just-ln—J ust out.
Parkes is not coming back to power in
N.S.W. Were we inclined to worship the rising
sun, we’d likely fall upon our knees to Abbott.
So the lines have been defined in N.S.W,
It’s to be Orangeism and Free-trade against Inde-
pendence and Proti otion. We’ll hack Protection.
During the “ blockheads’ blockade ” in
the N.B.W. Assembly, Parkes, Neild, and Co ,
stood like a stonewall—and showed about equal
sense.
On dit that Mr. W. 8. Targett, M L. A. for
Llthgow, will shortly resign his teat In the N.S W.
Assembly and serve his country in a Government
billet.
“Freetrade,” says Sir Saul Samuel, “is a
condition precedent to Imperial Federation.” All
the Australlas are gradually becoming Protec-
tionist.
The office of Attorney-General must be
regarded as a bonne bouche by the law sharks in
Tasmania. No less than nine lawyers are candi-
dates in the forthcoming general election.
“ A Protestant Home Rule League has
been started in Belfast to support Mr. Gladstone.”
Bo that the Irish Question is not altogether one of
religion, as the L.O.L. would have us believe.
G. H. Reid refuses to debate the question
of Protection v. Freetrade, at Orange, because of
the bad feeling which will arise. That’s so. The
Freetraders always do feel had after such debates.
Antonio Bergensteiner admitted last week
tn a Sydney Police Court that he was an unoertl-
Qcated insolvent. We have not yet heard what
constituency he intends to represent in the next
N.S.W. Parliament?
Sir Henry Parkes said in the Assembly
last Saturday night that he cared little for Mr.
Ninlan Melville’s opinion. The member for Nor-
thumberland replied that many people cared less
for Sir Henry’s signature.
During the obscene orgies indulged in by
the N.S.W. Assembly last week, Mr. F. Glbbts
twice occupied the Speaker’s chair until someone
pulled him out. This was exceedingly irregular.
Fred. Gibbes is no speaker.
The fee paid to warders who swing the
cat in N.S.W. gaols is £2lofor each case. Thus
the rate varies iiccording to sentence from 2s. to
4s. 2d a lash. Flogging is a good thing for the
lashers, but what of the lashee ?
Mr. J. P. Abbott, perhaps the most master-
ful man in the N.S. W. Assembly, will shortly
make a strong Protectionist speech. But Mr.
Abbott is a lawyer, and will never make a Badioal
leader—especially as he’s a Conservative.
Though the Government of the day care-
fully suppressed the fact, it is now known that
over £250,000 worth of property belonging to the
NSW. Lands and Mining Department was con-
sumed in the burning of the Sydney Garden
Palace.
The Victorian Council has spent three
weeks debating over the address in reply. It
would save a great deal of valuable time if the
House would simply acknowledge his Excellency’s
speech by “ shouting ” a long beer and then get to
business.
An arithmetical fiend in N.Z. has ascer-
tained, after much calculation, that it would have
taken a man with a shovel about 1,000,000 years
to move the slush thrown out by Mount Tara-
wera, and that at 61, per ton the job would have
cost £150.060,009. The volcano did it gratis, and
saved the country this vast expenditure, and yet
people do not seem to be jubilant.
Hon. G. R. Dibbs, N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary, denies the report that there is a “split” in
the Cabinet. Things are a bit unsettled, but no
one will “split.” Mr. Dibbs has been a member
of each of the last three Governments in N.S.W.
While such a system prevails, it will be impossible
to get a Government which will honestly review
the delinquencies of its predecessors.
In the Victorian Legislative Assembly,
recently, a number of members opposed tne
second reading of a Bill to extend the liability of
employers for injuries sustained by their work-
men, and stated frankly that they objected be-
cause the measure would be “injurious to capital.”
Statesmen of the good old Tory pattern seem to
give themselves away gratis when they start
assigning reasons.
Russia, seeing England in domestic trouble,
has further abrogated the treaty resultant from
the Crimean war, by declaring that Batoum, on
the Black Sea, is no longer a free port. Bussia is
like the blaokfellow who stalks the emu : she
always takes one step when tae bird has its head
on the ground. Possibly, however, the present
move is an Imperialistic one, directed at the
Democratic Gladstone.
That feeble personage, Mr. C. J. Roberts,
M.P., C.M.G..&0., voted in favour o f the ad valorem
proposals of the N.S.W. Ministry a few weexs ago.
Since tuen he has accompanied Sir Henry Parkes
on his tour through the country where Brickhlli's
Baby waslborn, and he is now voting with Parkes
against the Ministry. Has the C. H.G. been
“ nobbled” by the promise of a portfolio ? If we
have a Ministry with an O’Connor why not one
with a Roberts ?
The other day we heard that Mr. Henniker
Heaton, M.P., had been elected to the Carlton
Club. We now read in Vanity Fair, an organ of
the political party of whicn the Carlton Club is
representative, that the club contains ‘ social
parasites, gin-distillers, drapers, furniture-dealers,
usurers, and Giber wealthy nonentities without
number—but not a single editor or proprietor of
any newspaper ” In which category, then, is Mr.
Henniker Heaton included ?
The Kapunda Herald goes straight and
strong for the abolition of distress for rent. The
question is worth a lot of attention. There is
really no reason why a landlord should be specially
assisted in recovering a debt to the prejudice and
loss of tradesmen and other ereditors. Progressive
Australia must investigate carefully the justice
of claims allowed under the system of law im-
ported to this continent from the old-world. Few
legal rights have less of justice than this one of
seizing chattels in satisfaction of rent.
A German newspaper, with a name like a
cough and a sneeze, announces that the betrothal
of Pnnce Oscar ot Sydney to the Princess Louise,
eldest daughter of Wales, will soon take place, hut
there are still difficulties in the way. The Swedish
Reichstag, once so full of slushy “ loyalty,” re-
fuse to vote a pension to the young prince. They
say the King, regarded as an article of furniture,
is not so had, ana they don’t mind paying for him,
but the prince had better go into the crab and
°yster trade, and try to make an honest living
n b f oQe j » vacant * aQd then he can apply
for the billet and live on the nation.
i® a big lump of justice underlying
the idea put forward by a valued correspondent
who writes to The Bulletin thus: —“ The State
should make every man work—say, from the age
of 18 to 30. Why should all the bard and dirty
physical labour fall on the class least able to work
hard ?—the uneducated and under-fed ? If it be
necessary (but it is not) that the labour should be
done by one class, surely the fittest class is that of
the well-fed, the strong, and the educated—that is,
the sons and daughters of the wealthy.” This
bold reformer was born about 500 years too soon,
but he has got down to the bed-rock of the social
difficulty for all that.
Thus Thadeus O’Kane, of |the Northern
Miner (than whom, let us remark, political B.C.
priests have no more uncompromising opponent):
“ The parson-ridden Press of Australia la jubilant
over the defeat of Mr. Gladstone’s Irish Home
Buie Bill. The Sydney Morning Herald lifts
its sanctimonious voice in exultation. Tne Bris
bane Courier and the Telegraph, under parson
inspiration, re-echo the cry of Protestant Ascen-
dancy. The Church is in danger, and down with
Popery. The Bookhampton Bulletin Joins in
the holy howl, and the Charters Towers Herald
closes the dingo chorus with William Doonau and
the Charters Towers Orangemen.”
“Dear Bulletin,— Have a look at this.
Up the Paroo way the shearers and the rouse-
abouts are striking—feed is getting plentiful, the
rivers are navigable, wool has gone up, and the
men want the old prices. The masters won’t give
it, so the men go ‘ out.’ To counteract this, the
masters wire to the Immigration Depot, Sydney—
‘ Send up 150 unemployed.’ These men come to
Bourke free by rali (at least some have come to
my knowledge). When there they are found to be
starving—no blankets, no billies, no food. These
are provided by a paternal Government in order
to enable M'Caughey, of Toorale, to fight his
recalcitrant hands. Is this ‘ jonnick ?’—Yours
truly, 0.K,”
The Sydney Globe has published a leader
on Parkes’ Freetrade speech at Orange, and
headed it “ Dotage or Lies ?” We have read the
article carefully, and are quite unable to say
which is the correct title. Perhaps the lies are a
trifle ahead, but It is a very close race. Following
this, however, appeared a sub-leader, also devotee
to Henry, which let the poor old man down with
an unlooked-for compliment, “He leads,” said
the Globe, “not because his ‘ragged regiment’
like or trust him, hut because they are ragged—
because he is strong and they are weak—because
he always was and ever will be the very devil to
deceive.” Yet he has apparently not succeeded in
deceiving the Globe, so he must he a very second-
rate devil after all.
“ What shall we say of the Idle Aristoo-
raoy, the owners of the soil of England, whose
recognised function is that of handsomely con-
suming the rents of England, and as an agreeable
amusement (if the purchase-money and other con-
veniences serve) dllietanteing in Parliament and
Quarter Sessions for England? We will say
mournfully, in the presence of Heaven and Eartn
—that we stand speechless, stupid, and know not
what to say I That a class of men entitled to live
sumptuously on the mfarrow of the earth; per-
mitted simply, nay, entreated, and as yet en-
treated in vain, to do nothing at all in return,
was never heretofore seen on the face of this
planet.” Thomas Carlyle, quoted for the benefit
of the Australian Primrose Leaguers.
The story goes that a certain Sydney
stipendiary, finding he would be detained by pub-
lic business in the city all night-telegraphed to the
sergeant in his suburb asking that the police
might keep an eye on his (the; magistrate’s) resi-
dence. The Telegraph Department having refused
to take paper money for the “ wire,” and pass it
on as 0.H.M.8., the magistrate brought the case
before the reigning Postmaster-General, who
sided with the permanent head of the department,
and declared the money must be paid. But the
magistrate held out for 18 months, when a second
P.M.G. came into power, and then, fringing the
matter up again “on principle,” the department
was deprived of the two shillings in dispute,
whereupon the saving Solon went his way re-
joicing.
Mr. Blaine, of the U.S. A. Senate, sums up
the system of Irish Government in one sentence,
thus: “In a Parliament 0f*.658 members. Great
Britain has 553 and Ireland 105, and except with the
consent of that Parliament Ireland cannot organise
a gas company, or a horse railroad company, a
ferry over a stream, or do the slightest thing that
Implies legislative powers.” This is the system
which the bogus Ulster army—now mustering
75,000 dummy privates with half-a-dozen missing
noblemen to lead them—is pledged to support.
And Tories, Orangemen, and all kinds of miscel-
laneous fossils would have us believe that they are
prepared to steep their cotton umbrellas-we
mean their flashing swords, the umbrella was a
clerical error-in blood to make this tyranny
eternal.
Dear Bulletin,— Near Louth, on the Dar-
ling, a meeting was called to express disapproval
of the N.S.W. Land Act. The squatters knew
better than to put one of their own members into
the chair, but to give the affair an air of Tbona
jldes they induced a good-natured bullocky to
take the whip. After the spouting had been done,
chiefly by a local station-manager, tha charioteer
was told to put the motion. He promptly said;
“ I beg to propose that this meeting approves of
the Land Aot.” A deafening shout carried the
motion, although Mr. C— was tugging and pinching
at the chair, and trying to reverse the proposal.
There's nothing like whisky; but when the stage-
management omit a rehearsal they are asses.—
Yours, Hiram Abipf. P.S.—The meeting wa*,
however, reported in the locals as desired by the
promoters,
Mr. Wall, junior member for Mudgee, has
given notice of motion to declare the whole
colony of N.S.W. a mlninfirarea, so that any portion
alienated since May, 1880, may be resumed by
Government upon payment to the owner of the
amount of tne suriace value of the land and the
improvements thereon. Mr. Wall is going for a
sound principle in a blundering way. He is trying
to model justice with a pickaxe. His mot on,
if carried, will bs necessarily futile; and even
if the reform were attempted on his lines, the
State would gain only the very sma last possible
benefit. The claims tor compensation would eat
up all the benefit to be gained by the resumption.
If Mr. Wall goes straight for mining on private
property, and State royalty on all minerals, he
will get a large amount of independent support,
but his present resolution will only hinder the re-
form it Is meant to favour.
Mr. N. Healy, writing to the Oootamundra
paper, points out that the S M. Herald, which all
along has pretended to look with suspicion and
alarm on Gladstone’s Irish policy, and tried to
show that the Sydney feeling was not a representa-
tive one has.ltn a leading article on the annual cele-
bration of the American “ Day of Independence,”
the following words of rejoicing at the event
commemorated on the fourth of July“ We join
in the celebration ot the day, not because it re-
minds us of the humiliating defeat of British
armies, or the loss of splendid territories to the
Empire of which we form a part, but because it sym-
bolises and embodies a long-continued and at last
successful struggle for the rights of self-govern-
ment.” The Herald is one of tnat numerous
class of papers that never worships anything but
success, and always barks for the uppermost dog.
Like the average Australian daily, it teaches
people to adore Garibaldi and Kossuth, but
solemnly warns all hands to take no interest in
Ireland, and to look askance on anyone who speaks
well of Parnell. That, too, Is the tme even of the
Age, which has turned Judas with Berry.
Cablegram from the Australian Tory-
directed daily Pre*s :—“ London, Tuesday.—A
large mob of Catholics assembled in the streets of
Duolin at midnigat and attacked a club of Orange
workmen. Tae occupants of the building fired
upon their eesailants, killing one and wounding
36, Seventy-five Of.-ngome i have been arrested.”
Italics ours. How glibly tne cable correspondent
talas of the B.C. mob! “ Mob” as contra-distln-
guisaed from “ crowd ” is an opprobrious epii.net:
you speak of a “ mob ’ of aggressive ruffians—of
a “crowd” of respectable, orderly, law-abiding
citizens. Equally neat is the ingenuous cable’s
statement that the Orangemen in me “ club” were
workmen ’’—lnference: nice,clean, respectable,
good, pious, toiling Christian fathers of families,
who had assembled after a day’s labour not to
plan and plot and scheme and promote sedition
and religious discord—oh, no I - and who were sud-
denly attacked by a howling drove of bloodthirsty
fanatics whom they, the dove-like Innocent crea-

ice cablemao Is genorally a liar. We’ve ready to
make a sporting declaration that when the full
facts come out it will be seen that the Orangemen
(how did the Orangemen get arms while the Arms’
Aot continued in force ?) are a deal more cul-
pable than the other side.
On behalf of the Victorian Irrigation Bill,
an enthusiastic M.L.A. said that If the Govern-
ment proposals were carried out thoroughly “ the
’fklue of the oniony would be increased from
£50,000 000 to £100,000,000 during the next 20 years.”
He meant the land value of the landowners, all of
whom might follow the load of Sir Samuel Wilson
and devote the unearned increment to the service
or a condescending aristocracy. It is idle to talk
about increasing the land-value of an Australian
colony when any English syndicate might buy up
that land at its present price, hold it for the speci-
fied 20 years, and then sell it again in the London
market at cent, per cent, profit; and, even if there
be no absentee landlords, it is a precious small
consolation for the people to know that a success-
ful irrigation scheme will merely aggrandise (in
the main) the noble army of capitalists and create
a race of drones. It is computed that the carrying
through of Mr. Deakin’s schemes will Involve an
expenditure of four millions. That is to say, the
people have to find four millions for a risky ex-
periment. If it fails the people lose their money.
If it succeeds the landowners reap the benefit.
They and their families immediately renounce
labour and probably take themselves toYurrup.
No. Without Land Nationalisation all the Irriga-
tion Bills in the world will fall to improve the
condition of the humble tollers and moilers on the
soil which is enriched.
Perhaps comparatively few are aware of
the extent of the scandalous corruption resorted
to, to effect the union of Ireland with Great
Britain 86 years ago. Here is a small selection
from the long list of those whose votes were pur-
chased :—J. Bingham, created Lord Clanmorris ;
£BOOO fer two seats, and £l5 00J compensation for
Team ; had first offered himself for sale to the
anti-Unionists. Joseph H. Blake, created Lord
Wallscourt. Sir J. G, Blackwood, created Lord
Dufferin. Sir John de Biakquiere, created Lord
de Blaqukre, with offices and pensions. Lord
Boyle, son of Lord Shannon ; father and son re-
ceived each £15,C00 for their boroughs. Charles
H. Coote, created Lord Castlecoote, with a regi-
mental patronage in Queen’s County, and £7500 ,ln
cash. James Cuff, his father made Lord Tyrawley.
Lord Fitzgerald, a pension and a peerage. Luke
Fox, made a J udge of Common Pleas. William
Fortescue, a pension of £3OOO a year. J. G albralth,
1 a baronetage. Biohard Hare, made Lord Bn-
nismore, with patronage. Colonel B. Henniker,
a regiment and £3500 a y.mr for his seat.
Hon. J. Hutchinson made Lord Hutohinson and a
General. Hugh Howard made Postmaster-General.
William Handcock, an extraordinary instance.
He made and sang songs against the union in 1798,
and made and sang songs for it in 1800, for which
he was made Lord Castlemaine—a title of peculiar
infamy, having been] given by Charles 11. to one
Palmer for the debauching of his wife. W. G.
Josoelyn, promotion in the army, and bis brother
made Bishop of Lismore. William Johnstone,
according to the statement made by him, returned
to Parliament by Lord Castlereagh to put an end
top, “a Judgeship.” Bight Hon. H. Langrlshe,
£15,000 for his patronage of Knocktopher and a
Commissionership of Revenue. T. Llngray, £l5OO
and a Commissionership of Stamps. J. Longfleld
made Lord Longfleld. Lord Loftus, £30.000 for
boroughs and made an English marquis. H.
D. Massey, £4OOO in cash. Bight Hon. Lodge
Morris, made a peer. Sir B. Mussgrove made
Eeceiver of Customs, with £l2OO a year.
James M’Cleland, made Baron of Exchequer. Sir
W. G. Newcomen, a peerage for his wife, &o.
H. F. Prattle made Lord DunaUy. Sir Bichard
Quia made a peer. The Hon. H. Sheflingtorn made
clerk of Paper Offices at the Castle with £7500 for
his patronage. H. M. Sandford made Lord Mount
Sandford. John Stewart made Attorney-General
and a baronet. Hon. B. Stratford, £7500 as half
oomoensation for Baltinglass. Hon. J. Stratford,
£7500 for the other half of Baltinglass and pay-
master of foreign troops, with £l3OO a year. Bight
Hon. J. Toler, a peerage and Cnief Justiceship.
Hon. B. Trench made a peer and ambassador. This
is a mere fragment of a list of 140 persons thus
brought up. Amongst the most prominent pick-
ings were those of Lord Shannon for his patronage
in the Commons, £45,000; the Marquis of Ely,
£45,000; Lord Clanmorris, £45,000; Lord Belvi-
dere, £45,000 ; 'Sir Henry Langrishe, £45,000.
Then follows a long and frightful list of lawyers
who sold their influence in the Irish Parliament—a
solemn warning against the admission of too many
lawyers to Parliament. We may select a few of
the ;most lavishly-paid :—Mr- Charles Osborne
made Judge of King’s Bench, £3300; Mr. St. John
Daly, ditto, £3300; Mr. Williams made Baron of
Exchequer, £3303; Mr. M'Leland, ditto, £3300; Mr.
Hubert Johnson made Judge of Common Pleas,
£3300; Mr. William Johnson, ditto, £3300; Mr.
Torrens, ditto. £3300; Mr. Vandeleur made Judge
of Queen’s Bench, £3300; Mr. Charles Ormsby
Counsel to Commissioners Value, £5000; Mr. Henry
Dean Grady, ditto, £5000; Mr Jemlson as Com-
missioner for distributing a million and a half of
compensation money, £1203. “ The price of a
single vote was £BOOO in money, or an appointment
to an office of £2OOO a year. Some got both for their
votes, and no leas than 20 peerages, 10 bishoprics,
and six puisne Judgeships were tne prices of votes
for the union, disclosing the astounding fact that
£1,275,000 have been paid In purchase of Irish
borougns, and more tnan £l,OOO 000 expended in
bribes,” Comment would be superfluous!
In the grand old days of public executions,
when a halo of ghastly glory surrounded the
“ gent ” upon the gallows, many a man was thereby
incited to make a short cut to distinction by mur-
dering his missus. It seems that the dainty dishes
of horrors sarved up in penn’orths by the Nooze
have a similar tendency. Anyway, we read of a
Melbourne man. Peter Gray, telling his helpmate
that ‘ the Herald would sell more because of
what he would d > for her than when the Kellys
were captured.” Finally he did do something for
the lady, and the Herald duly chronicled the
“ 'orrible assorlt.” If that man’s lot had been cast
in Sydney, he would have sought the bubble re-
putation in the blood-curdling columns of the
Nooze And without wishing to disparage the
little Melbourne organ, we must gently Insinuate
that Peter Gray carried his missus’s gore to the
wrong market.
A London paper utters sobs of anguish
over the case of a poor old man who appeared at
Southwark Police Court with his little dog in his
arms, and who in default of paying a fine was sent
to prison because he had not taken out a license,
though he pleaded with tears that he had always
paid it hitherto, and that his little dog had been
his friend for 18 years. Before the day was over
more than 30 ladies and gentlemen, some of
them titled,” had called at the Police Court to
•' shell out the damage,” one of the latter also
fetching the dog and taking out the license. All
through the next few days, too, remittances to
liquidate the flue kept pouring in from all parts of
the country until the ancient mongrel had re-
ceived almost his weight in gold. It may occur to
some that as dogs usually die before they are 14,
aa adult pup, aged 18 years, is rather a doubtful
rarity, but perhaps the old man put on eight or
nine years to increase the effect. But the striking
point is that men with helpless children are daily
sent to prison without the public contributing a
cent for the little ones, and that, after all, the rush
of benevolence was not evoked on behalf of the
unfortunate man, but for the sake of the mangy
beast. If the case had been reversed, and the dog
had appeared with the man la his arms, it is ques-
tionable if the result would have been so satis-
factory, unless, indeed, the novelty of the affair
had aroused the generous nation to come to the
rescue. After all it la better to be a toothless cur
than a hungry man just now in England,

The “ evil spirit of the Cabinet ” is what
they call G. E. Dibbs, in the N.S.W. Assembly.

The N.S.W. Legislative Assembly has been
listingutahlng itself lately. Its members have
jeen Bitting all day and all night for half a
iveek at a stretch, accusing each of ‘ drunken-
ness,” "cowardice,” and “ blackguardism, an
ringing changes on the words, “ coward, ar, (i
» dastard,” “ ruffian.” “ hound,” “ swine, cur,
"puppy.” and the adjectives usually appendant
(In the society of bullockies) to those terms. The
people who are so unfortunate as to live on the
other side of the street in which the Assembly-
chamber is situated, have been deprived of sleep
by the noise of the obscene brawling in the legisla-
tive pothouse. "Healer in pigs!” shrieked one
senator; "high-handed villainy 1” gasped another;
‘incapable tyrants and crawling d “®,® rß * * lo r
cuped a third; "miserablescoundrels 1 yelped a
fourth; and so on. The Government side of
the House is ruled by brute animal propensities,
remarked the hoary-beaded Sir Henry Parkes;
and if the statements of a number of hon. mem-
bers are to be believed, a stiff percentage of the
august assembly was drunk—quite drunk. P nay,
the House (Me) adjourned because (hie) it didna
wmh to deB6 (hie) crate the Sawhath! Amen.
Aldermen Rounsevell, of Adelaide, who
’ ately called the whole of the local Civic officers
“liars,” has, it is telegraphed, "withdrawn any
objectionable remarks made, and regrets t a
any offence was taken as none was Intended.
It is well for this guileless Bounsevell man, who
calls people liars and then says he didn’t think
they would be offended, that he lives in the holy
snd snuffling city of Adelaide Instead of among
the cowboys of the Arizonan wilds. Even if Wil-
liam Bounsevell, who adds insult to injury by
expressing surprise that any man should feel
annoyed at being called a liar-even if Wil-
liam Bounsevell applied such an epithet to a
Woolloomooloo larrikin or a Chinamans bully
from Little Bourke-street, there might be
trouble, culminating in an undertaker’s knock st
the front door. If all the Adelaideans are thus
easily satisfied in the matter of apologies, it is
plain that the getting of the whoie population into
ffaol for some meanness of a Crooksian or
Walkerlan description is only a matter of time.
Tirif mfiiiv after all we have heard lately about
in front of it.
In Melbourne, recently, a young woman
who had read about Neild and Parkes, and who
wished, like them, to climb the dizzy pinnacle of
fame, struck an ingenious method of becoming a
miblic character. She went out at night to a
lonelv soot on the St. Kilda-road, and there scat-
tered half-a-dozen buttons, a shattered parasol,
and a bracelet on the ground, tore her dress,
punched herself on the cheat and ribs untU she
was covered with bruises, spilt a quantity of acid
over her wardrobe, and finally lay down, and
shrieked. When assistance arrived, and the'Pros-
trftte female was hoisted into such a position that
her soine once more pointed towards the glitter-
fng firmament, she explained that she had been
assaulted by four men who had since left. But,
somehow or other, suspicion was aroused, and at
last she confessed that she had been playing a lone
hand in the whole performance. If she had not
thus let the oat out of the portmanteau, however,
the chances are about even that some unfortunate
would have been flogged over the affair,
an many, no doubt, have been in the past
mider similar circumstances. ladies of this
class must have a little amusement at times,
and as they cannot distinguish themselves by
sneaking for nine hours, or trying to poke out the
eve of a lighthouse with the beak of a coasting
Meamerf or backing themselves to wheel a pump-
kin in a handbarrow from Normanton to Mel-
bourne. they must seek their happiness by the
b=st means in their power. And there is, we pre-
sume, a certain holy .joy to be derived from doing
a tom-cat solo in a ditch at midnight.
The death of Mr. T. R. Hogg, of Sydney
fonoe of the firm of Boyle and Hogg), who com-
mitted suicide on Saturday last, .F
better man than the average of those who take
this sudden method of ending all earthly troubles.
Mr Hogg had been suffering from intense mental
depression; owing to financial difficulties, and nc
one can doubt that he was utterly irresponsible at
the time of his death. At the funeral the officiat-
ing o’ergyman made a speech which contained at
o striking appeal that the memory of the dead
Should behefdsacfed, and a tacit reproof of the
rhriatian bigotry which covers the name of a sui-
cide with opprobrium. Before the last prayer, Mr.
Baber said that as his action might be cha lenged by
many he desired to state that, as he considered the
Ssad act of their departed friend to be due to a
sudden collapse of an overwrought brain and done
without intent to effect a crime, he felt d ustifled in
committing him into the hands of God. His life
had been a good one. his family relations of the
most affectionate character, and nothing but the
sudden giving way of his mental balance could
nave induced his melancholy act. To the tender
sympathies of all he commended the poor broken-
hearted widow and little orphans. The scene while
Mr Baber made these remarks was most affecting.
Beautiful wreaths of flowers covered the coffin,
and flowers were lovingly thrown into the grave
aa the large company of mourners departed. The
man who g would utter such words as these is un-
doubtedly vastly in advance of the majority of his
brethrenso far as charity and other Christian
virtues are concerned, but such an apology
emild hardly be needed except in a land where
therms so much church and so little religion as in
New South Wales. It is the almost invariable
mi atom of cornstalk holiness to assume that the
Alm?ghty views the rash act of the suicide from
the same standpoint as a bumptious coroner and a
brutSh publio-house jury, and that the Anal sal-
vation of the victim depends upon the verdict of
"temporary insanity.” But too few are prepared
to make allowance for the mental anguish which
leads an honourable man to seek death in order
tn escape from troubles that would have no weight
whatever with the whitewashed hypocrite, and in
the minds of whole droves of prominent church-
men. the haloed swindler who goes to jail, has a
better chance hereafter than his brother who
prefers a leap in the dark to facing worldly diffl-
culties and temptations which might prove too
much for his powers of resistance. Mr. Baber s
words contain a reproof to the stony-hearted mul-
titude who judge the suicide unheard, but he
fflht will have gone further, and have told his
hearers that many who thus condemn the dead
are a thousand times worse than be.
Mr. W, J. Triokett has resigned the posi-
tion of Chairman of Committees In the N.S.W.
Assembly. He had heard that Jaw Bone Neild
was pre t aring another speech.
Mr. .Foster, in the N.S.W. Assembly, Tues-
day complained that not sufficient chance of dis-
cussing the Customs Bill had been allowed. Yet
Neild had spoken for nine hours, and the others,
together blathered away for three days at a
stretch. The House pretty soon gets tired of Mr-
Foster discussing anything.
A dreary debate on a motion of adjourn
ment constituted the business of the N.S.W.
Assembly on Tuesday night. The Opposition
made a tremendous effort to clear themselves of
the stigma of obstruction, and worked off a lot of
snuffle about the desecration of the Sawbath in
reviewing the conduct of the Ministry. Mr. Lloyd
took the opportunity of denying that he was ever
called out of church on Sunday to arrange about
a cargo of flour-the yarn he said originated in the
joking remark of a friend. This is a uew idea.
Libels of that kind usually emanate from an
enemy.
The inquiry into the alleged N.S.W. rail-
way frauds is likely to bring some very interest-
ing information to light, besides that already
obtained. Messrs. Lee and Macalister, of Bourke,
are charged with having made a profit of £3BO on
the carriage of 1000 bales of last s eason’s clip. The
defence seems to be that their way of working
was sanctioned by the Department. It is not pro-
bable that the prosecution will bring up any more
evidence than is absolutely necessary for their
purpose; but it is certain that nothing short of a
revolution in the present system of railway
management will satisfy the public.
The following item is calculated to induce
the average churchman to flop in silent, prayerful
horror. At Invercargill (N.Z.) there was recently
a heavy fall of snow, and the heathen Buddhists,
who were making their usual rounds in the
cabbage business, were considerably pelted. Gee
Bung—or some such name—was one of the suf-
ferers, and having more pluck than the average
Mongol, he laid down his baskets and prepared to
charge. Before he had time to spit on his hands,
however, the Bishop came along-a real live
Bishop made out of meat-and, after exhorting
Gee to exercise the virtue of meekness, he turned
to remonstrate with the boys. Then followed an
episode which is calculated to men
think the Bishop trade is about pUyed out,
for these sinful little imps actually snowballed the
boss shepherd and drove him away. We close this
ohrenlole with all the outward symptoms of deep
and heartfelt grief.
Up to the time of our writing, the Foley-
cum-Newton-Lees combination have held two
shows at Foley’s gymnasium. Sydney. brJore large
and orderly audiences. The principal event of
the two evenings was the meeting of our cham-
pion, Foley, and Peter Newton 1 nthree round 8o n
Monday night. We had grave doubts as to wither
Foley, with his present want of kip, would
show up with his old-time cleverness, but our
fears were soon dispelled on that score, as the
champion got all over Newton, and aho wed that
he has not forgotten the tricks of the, trade put
into him by that “ master of the art, Gipsy Mace.
Lees and Newton’s set-to was of tne One, two,
three, four, you lead with the left, I counter on
the jaw,” something after the style of the stage-
cutlass combat, but there was nothing of tricky,
clever fighting about it, although the sounding
flip-flops of the open gloves take with the audience,
who mistake the sounders for heavy hits. Lees
box with Pablo Frank, if such it may be called, was
very so so, Lees holding out his f a ° 9 t°,be hit at,
shouting to Pablo to hit hard, and hed Foley s
vroteai had the pluck of a mosquito, he would
have swung his right, which he Is well able to do,
and put Mr Lee R 3 into his little cot “Flash”
business does not take with the Public, as the
hisses so freely bestowed clearly showed; and, by
the way, we are glad to see little Murphy has
dropped a lot of his hanky-panky. His bout with
Fuller on the Saturday evening was one of the best
features of the show. A stranger to te i a lad of
Murphy’s poor physique stand in front of a man
of Fuller’s massive build would feel inclined to
cry “take him away,” but Murphy is well able to
take care of himself, and in besting Fuller showed
that cleverness and hard-hitting will soon bring a
man down to his weight. Next Saturday night is
the concluding, and should prove the beat show
of the season, as the odds are the bruisers will
“go ” for one another on the *’ reputation racket.


The Sydney D.T. says:—“i'ne body of a
man, name unknown, was found dead in a pad-
dock at Alexandria yesterday.” It is always well
to be explicit, else people might have thought it
was only a stonewalling politician lying about
drunk.
Professor Anderson Stuart, M.D., is giving
instructive lectures to women on nursing and
other useful subjects. We mention this in the
hope—a vain, one possibly—that some society
females will for a moment forget their figures and
dresses and abominations of fashions generally,
and go and learn something that may make them
less utterly useless when, for some inscrutable
reason. Divine Providence makes mothers of them,
Instead of turning them into sausage-meat.
The Victorian Legislature is now busy on
a bill concerning corpses, skeletons, and similar
cheerful subjects. It appears that the Anatomy
Act has hitherto made it compulsory to bury ai!
11 subjects” within six weeks, and as a result the
Medical School has at times been rushed with
“ deaders,” while no w and then the professors could
not get anybody to cut-up for love or money. The
new measure gives them power to lay up the de-
parted in brine until wanted, and a vault is to be
constructed for the safe keeping of earned mur-
derers and pickled vagrants.

Dark care sat on the merchant’s brow,
His step was sad and slow,
In agonising pain he paced
His study to an fro.
No words escaped his trembling lips,
But many a sigh and groan
Betrayed the bitter grief he felt
To see his hopes o’erthrown.
His lifework haa been all undone
By one disastrous blow—
A bankrupt he, his stock bought up
By Summerfleld and Go.
’Twas bought for less than half its cost,
And sent out here by mail.
To be sold cheap by Summerfleld,
At their great bankrupt sal©.*

The “Private Secretary” now occupies
the boards at Sydney Opera House, Mr. Frank
Thornton filling the part of that boneless, guile-
less curat?, Rev. Robert Spalding. So long as this
clerical gentleman keeps sober, the success of the
piece seems certain, and we note with satisfaction
that he manifests no desire to pass the blowing
fowl—we mean the flowing bowl. His favourite
drink is the fruit of the oow, and as a precaution
against hunger he carries in his pocket a fusty
orange and a dog-eared bath-bun. But, though
intensely amusing on the stage, we are positive
the world never did, and never will, produce such
a curate. He has a complexion like that of the
white Soudan goat (now in Heaven), His whole
gable-end is white washed over with a touching,
soulful innocence that would charm a 10 per oeur,
rebate out of a bill-broking Canaanite; he is dadoed
three feet deep with simplicity and candour, and
literally steeped in sacred ignorance. In the
matter of meekness and patience, the patriarch
who scraped himself with a broken saucer in the
land of Uz, was not a circumstance to him, and
unless Job is prepared to trump with his boils, Mr.
Spalding must win the trick. He is the image of
agruei-fed clergyman, originally brought up on
the feeding-bottle, and he nas evidently never re-
covered from that early regimen.
■ ■ •
In strong contrast to the curate is Uncle
Cattermole, a mutton-headed thunderstorm, with
a shook of disorganised thatch, whose great desire
Is that his nephew should "go it.” The young
man, however, has no ambition in that way, but
under pressure he makes a beginning by backing
a frlend’s;bill—discounted by Jenkins-refusing to
pay his tailor, and “sassing ” his landlady. Find-
ing that stronger measures are required, he starts
for the country, where he intends to raise a crop
of irrigated vice, and in his absence his stormy
uncle falls upon the pap-reared curate by mistake,
and makes that worthy man shake in his goloshes.
The way in which the parson throws his chances
away at this juncture, is simply maddening. We
ourselves were once encountered by an uncle who
mistook us for his long iost nephew. He was a
pawnbroker by profession, and was tearfully, sor-
rowfully drunk, but we improved the shining
hour by borrowing 30s. on our Waterbury, and
then embraced our new-found relative and left.
Mr. Spalding has a good show to borrow at least
£5OO from his temporary uncle, but he neglects
the opportunity until the mistake is discovered.
During the interval, however, the curate’s suffer-
ings are terrible. He is served with writs by a
misguided tailor; he is mistake a for a spiritualistic
medium, and when he asks for a ham sandwich
is supposed to be communing with the ghost of
departed pork; he is hidden under a table and
biffed on the heal with a prayer-book when he
tries to crawl out; he is crowded into a box and
sat upon, and when in despair h© folds his martial
antimacassar around him and tries to sleep he is
taken for a spectre. When at last it is ascertained
that all this anguish la caused by the neohe w’s
frenzied determination to " go It,” the uncle’s joy
knows no bounds, and he Is last seen settling the
tailor’s bill and acting the part of a beneficent
Providence as well as hia enlarged liver will permit.
♦ * •
When Mr. Thornton starts to be a fool he
does it to perfection. The curate with the
Soloahea and the bath-bun, as delineated by him,
i the most colossal ass whom we have yet seen,
and every time Mr. Thornton acts tho part he dis-
closes new and undreamt of capabilities for being
an ass which would have made the So udau animal
die of envy. Mr. Harwood, as Uncle Cittermole,
is equally good. His favourite greeting of “ How’s
tout liver” strikes us as a remarkable instance of
refined courtesy, and bis loud voice is engaged in
a constant struggle taroake itself heard above the
din of his still louder waistcoat. Among the other
nerformers, Mr. Palmer, as an inebriated but
«> hambitlous” tailor, is about the best, though the
ladles also acquit themselves very well. It is a
cause for Sincere thankfulness that there is
neither a dude nor a lap-dog in the piece, for pub-
lic interest in both these animals has long since
been worn down to a stump ; neither is there the
usual wicked man who folds his arms on the roof
of bis chest and asks in hollow tones “ Is this to
be-” nor the good man who squashes the aforesaid
sinner in the last act like an over-ripe tomato.
And when we consider how many modern come-
dies are built chiefly on a superstructure of duds,
doir and tomato, it becomes easy to account for
the’evergreen popularity of " The Private Secre-
tary ” Mr. Wm. A. Jenkins, too, displays hia cus-
tomary ability as business manager, and any credit
not otherwise appropriated may be set down to
his account. „ „ „

The Federal Minstrels at Sydney Academy
have adorned t?c»- programme with a number of
new items, soma very good, and others—well, the
less said about them the better. The sketch,
Mary’s hoard the News,” belongs decidedly to
tho latter class, while the allegorical tableau repre-
senting N.S.W. dispensing succour to the survivors
of the Ly-ee-Moon disaster, holds a sort of middle
position. The colony is depicted in the customary
style—as an attractive young woman dressed in a
horse-blanket and a mosquito-curtain, a mode of
attire which seems rather cool in winter weather.
Possibly, however, she wraps a door-mat round her
shoulders when she "does the block. We had a
little difficulty in making out some of the details
of the scene, hut. as far as we could discover,
N.S.W. was standing up on a kitchen-table and
handing a pork-pl© to the Ly- 60-Moon. The
exigencies of space made it necessary to sketch
the ship as about six times the size of the colony;
hut, as the former was wrecked on but a small
fragment of N.S.W,, this is probably a mere
poetic—or rather upholstery —license.
9 * *
The best and most successful feature of
the entertainment, however, is the burlesque,
•• struck Castor Oil,” an amusing parody on John
Stofel and his family, at the Royal. John is repre-
sented as a Dutch nigger, from Balmain; while
his wife is French, and his daughter (Air. Law-
ton) is terribly Irish. The head of the household
is a poor cobbler, who is striving hard Id rear his
family on a pittance of £lOOO a year, and '.it is,
therefore, not surprising that he should fall into
the toils of Sneakin Fatter, a sleek Salvationist,
who wants to evade service in the police force.
He finally agrees to act as the latter's substitute,
and accepts his IO U for 31. 61. (without endorse-
ment) which precious document he conceals by
leaving it on the hearth, and placing a dish-cover
on top. Shortly after John joins the force, an
alarm is given that some larrikins are stoning a
yellow oat in Woolloomooloo, and in the riot that
ensues, the Dutch “ peeler ” receives injuries that
terminate in Insanity. For 16 years he wan-
ders round Paddington and Woollahra with a
porous-plaster on his head, and Indulges in the
pleasant dream that he is Jawbone Neild, and once
spoke for nine hours in the Assembly. Finally,
hewever, he is cured by a oom-doctor, and then,
hidden behind a towel-rack in his old cottage, he
listens to the exposition of the Salvationist’s
villainy, until by the recovery and production of
rhe I O.U. for 3s. 61. he cover that wicked man
with well-merited disgrace.
* * * *
The only new thing to announce about
" Struck Oil ” this weex is that it will he with-
drawn on Friday (to-morrow) night from the
Royal. The run has been a fine one. Mr. Wil-
liamson puts on no airs in oonssquenee of the suc-
cess although it is understood that, in addition
to the talent he throws into the personation of
John Stofel, the quantity of genius he spread Over
the rest of the drama while it was being got read?
for the stage was more than considerable. Sam
Smith, the Californian miner, brought, it may
be remembered, the manuscrlut of " The
Deed, or Five Yekrs Away, to Williamson
when he was at San Francisco. That M».j
was the basis, of “ Struck Oil.” Poof Sam,
he retired with the wealth the yoffhg actor
gave him. His after proceedings do not appear to
have risen to the dignity of history. In the
meantime, Clay Greene and the actor set to on
Sam's germ and polished off the first two acts of
the present play, and then the third act, which is
certainly the best, was written by the actor sotws.
It is John Cassius Williamson who tells these
things, and the stylus of our old friend Garnet
Waloh vouches for their veracity. In any case,
vale "Struck Oill” On Saturday night will he
produced “The Shadows of a Great City. Mr.
Shewell la the writer, and it has been fitted for
Sensational stage use by Mr. Joseph Jefferson.

Mr. .tohn Rrien Widow O’Sheridan has
added a few new attractions to his enteftainment
at Sydney Gaiety. A number of new songs a PP® ar
in the programme—or at least old ones white-
washed and brushed up, and they are really better
than the new. A prominent feature is supplied
by Mr. Gordon, who gives life-like imitations of
several well-known actors. We would like to
furnish this gentleman with a valuable hint. We
had the pleasure, some years ago, of seeing one of
the characters whom he represented, inan entirely
novel role, which ended In his bruising a China-
man, pounding a policeman, and doing about ±lo
worth of damage to a shop-window, and if Mr.
Gordon could put this episode on the stage,
it would certainly be a great attraction.

The new name seems to be a masootte to
fie Sydney Princess Theatre, for the Buffaloes
always have good bis. on. While there Is sb much
change in the entertainment there need not be any
in the attendance, and if the attendance does not
change there is always sure to be plenty of change
in the treasury. Not content with walking, the
"ghost” at this establishment come up to the
scratch in waltz time on treasury-day. A new
programme introduced ou Monday night helps
things to bubble along.

L'artiste n'a poityt do pays, or, to put it
another way, the’ 1 artiste is always at home. Of
political or physical geography he is profoundly
Ignorant. Tne world is his oyster. He is the
biggest missionary of them all. Australian or even
Imperial Federation to him are questions c f no
import; intercolonial jealousies he cannot under-
stand; he alone speaks the universal language, it
is not surprising, therefore, that the Zerblni Quar-
tette concert, to be given on Friday evening, will
attract a crowded and fashionable attendance.
The audience, moreover, will be thoroughly re-
presentative, extending from Lord and Lady Car-
ington down to the smallest amateur fiddler, who
Will spend his last half-crown to go into the gallery
to hear the stringed quartettesof the great masters
rendered, as until now they have never been per-
formed in Australia. J. B. Zerblni, of the Monday
Popular Concerts, in Bt. James's Hall, London, will
be there ; Christian Reimers, violoncellist, and
spiritualist, himself possessed with the spirit of
Platti, will perform on the king of instruments,
Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, looking on from
Reimers’ “ distant heaven.” The vocalist will be
Madame Christian; the musical director and solo
pianist, Mr. T. H. Guenett; and the manager is
our old friend R. 8. Smythe, who comes to us once
again with magnificent surroundings. As It is an-
nounced that the Hon. the Premier and the
Ministers are to be present at the Zerbioi Quartette
Concert, there must be no stonewalling next Fri-
day evening.

Melbourne Opera House, after a week’s
Interregnum, has re-opened under the old manage-
ment of Rtgnold and Allison. The attraction is
Miss Bmllie Melville as Falka. Everybody has
seen “ Falka,” but nobody had seen the bewitch-
ing priiM donna since she departed for India’s
coral strand (and was stranded) two years ago.
Very melting stories haa been whispered about
her altered aspect and impaired bronchial tubes.
It was even said that the lady had bidden a sad
adieu to the operatic stage, and that—like Coreze,
In “ Moths ”—our nightingale would sing no more.
Under these circumstances it was only to be ex-
pected that the reappearance of Mies Emelie would
fetch ’em. It did fetch ’em, and they will probably
continue to be fetched for some time to come.
The enchantress (our vocabulary will be exhausted
in a minute) has come back again, bringing her
sheaves with her and a few over. We don’t know
exactly what that means. It is intended for jam.
Not quite as of old does Miss Meiville sing,
but her voice can be trusted to come round
soon with a little coaxing. Such a divinity,
who can sing a bird off a tree, should
find no difficulty in coaxing anything round;
and not quite as of old does Miss Melville look.
No, there s the rub. Before that ill-starred Indian
trip, she looked a full 35. Now she isn’t a day
more than 18 and a half. The ravages of sickness
have taken somewhat from the roundness of her
cheek, but left her younger than ever. We
would ourselves willingly go through 13 fevers
on such delightful terms. But it’s impossible to
let off all our frenzy in mundane prose. We must
borrow Apollo’s lyre for one moment.
When, Emilie, thy fairy face—
Illumined with its mystic grace—
Went with thee to another place,
Across the cruel main;
We languished—oh I a weary while;
Our day was dree, existence vile—
Now, ’neath the sunshine of thy smile,
We siog our songs again.
There are certain other changes in the “ Falka ”
cast, and taking them in the lump, they are by no
means for the worse. The opera is running with
every whit as much go as ever.

William Ewart Gladstone,
THE "GRAND OLD MAX."
Serene and Steadfast at Seventy-seven.
Serene and strong the grand old statesman stands,
His foes defying;
Upon the people of the British lands
Wisely relying.
They tell us that the man is old and gray;
So are the mountains
Whose bald heads glisten with the silver spray
Of crystal fountains.
Dark oloufs about the mountain-top may swim,
While peals the thunder;
But there it stands—a great, and gaunt, and grim
Eternal wonder.
The People's William knows his people well—
Yes, somewhat better
Than they can know themselves; so, truth to tell,
He’s not their debtor.
His domination fears no factions fight
Or coalition,
But hews its way with steady axe, in spite
Of opposition.
Though old in battles, on his sheathless brand
No stain of rust is;
With good old words he sways an ancient land—
Freedom and Justice.

All over the Western division of N.S.W.
the squatters are dismally howling about the times
and cutting down the wages of the rouseabouts
and the shearers, The reason of their dyspeptic
moanlog, however, will be more clearly under-
stood that a good season is distinctly seen ap-
proaching, rain has been general and Is still con-
tinuing, while the rivers are navigable again, and
it is anticipated the banks will take the earliest
opportunity of realising their long-standing ad-
vances and at the first chance kick the present
holders out. The squatters of the West are howl-
ing because a good season Is coming. Poor devils I
In its New Guinea news the! Sydney D.T.
says:-“ Nicholas Minister, a notorious character,
half beche-de-mer fisherman and half buccaneer,
against whom a charge of robbery and piracy on
the high seas was lodged by Mr. Kissack, Captain
Thomson's partner at Teste, as well as of kidnap-
ping native women, has been required by the
High Commissioner to proceed to Oooktown and
meet his accusers there.” The S M. Herald of
the same date says that “ Mr, Nicholas, the minister
against whom charges of robbery on the high
seas,” &c. We can hardly suppose that either Mr.
Nicholas, the minister, or Mr. Minister, the half
buccaneer, will accept the invitation to proceed to
Cooktown, but if he should do so there Is room for
a profitable libel action somewhere. It is an
atrocious slander to describe a pirate as a person.
Last Sunday week something like £500
was raised in the Catholic churches of Sydney and
suburbs in aid of the fund called “ Peter’s Pence.’
'i he usual “ poor mouth ” petitions were put for-
ward by the pulpiteers, who drew heartrending
pictures of the poverty-stricken condition of the
present Pope, who, if one-half we heard were true,
would be the champion “ broker ” of the day. As
a matter of fact, however, Papa Leo XIII. is not
exactly on his pontifical “uppers” yet, for, in
addition to his many other little perks, he
draws the Arse Eclesiasiico, or ecclesiastical pat-
rimony, of £130.000 per annum from the Italian
Government. Each of the Cardinals has an annual
State allowance of £1300 a year also, and this, with
the pickings derived from their respective offices,
enables them to keep the wolf from the door. We
doubt if the original Twelve ever held 500 pence
between them at any time—except when Judas
Iscariot clutched the 30 pieces of silver.
Bishop Linton, of Riverina, will be earning
a very full share of the pious hatred of his brother
clerics If he continues to act as he is reported to
have done lately. Wh n visiting at Silverton he
is said to have invited the resident clergy of each
denomination to take a hand in converting the
unregenerate miner. The affair came off in the
music-hall attached to one of the local hotels, and
all the clerics of the town were present except
the R.C. priest, who was unavoidably absent.
The Bishop's chaplain started business by reading
prayers, the Presbyterian minister followed with
the lessons, and then the Wesleyans and Bible
Christiana had a show, the Bishop himself preach-
ing the ssrmon, It would make a hard-shell Angli-
can howl to hear of such clerical depravity, but
Bishop Linton did much worse than that. He-
listen ye bigoted ones of all denominations he
divided the collection, which was a very large one,
with his clerical brethren. If such things continue
to be done, there may as well not be any strife at
all between the different denominations, and as the
essence of modern piety consists in the consign-
ment of all the members of other sects to ever-
lasting hell, Bishop Linton must be regarded as a
mischievous heretic who would sacrifice his church
to the Gospel. And further, on going home from
that service the Riverina prelate is said actually to
have tried to assist a poor drunkard who was
lying in the gutter. Such conduct is unclerical.
Dr. Linton should, like the Levite, have passed by
on the other side, and only have noticed the
drunkard for the sake of working in the old gaga
about an awful example.

A Magnificent Goldfield.
THE NEW AUSTRALIAN ELDORADO
Advices from Kimberley, Western Australia,
grow more and more confusing. We hear:—(l).
“There are nuggets there as large as hen’s eggs”;
(2). “ There are no eggs there”; (3). "There is only
one hen on the goldfield”; (4). "There are twice
as many hens as nuggets.” Wnat, in the name of
the Federal Council, are we to believe? Then
again, we see, in the Silver Age, reports tele-
graphed by two trustworthy experts dispatched
specially to examine the field: -"Latest news says
first patches washed out. No field found.— David
Collie.” “No fresh news from diggings, no gold
having been brought in during the last four
weeks. Strongly advise people not to come. I
positively assert that the
whole field has not pro-
duced 9000 z.— I. J. K.
Conn.” These latter
statements have at least
the merit of being the
result of a careful ex-
amination made by prac-
tical men who have
neither land nor cattle to
Bell, stores to dispose of
at famine prices, broken-
down spavined horses to
trade off in exchange for
the shekels of confiding
greenhorns, nor “ valu-
able ” mining properties
—consisting of a hole in
the ground and a melan-
choly windlass with a
greenhide bucket hang-
ing from a rotten rope—
to float off Into limited
liability swindles. But,
depressing as these re-
ports are, Mr. Conn’s
later advices are even
worse. He landed at
Derby en route for the
goldfield—that is to say,
he was put ashore on a
mudbank, and waded
through a mile and a-halt
of swamp before reach-
ing the town. The tide
at this place has a rise
and fall of 38 feet, which
makes the shipping busi-
ness decidedly precari-
ous. Derby he found to
consist of a few wooden
buildings, chiefly stores
and hotels. It is sur-
rounded by bottle-trees—
a species which only
seems to flourish near
pestilential swamps—and
the temperature averages
100' in the shade. And the
goldfield itself is non est;
prospectors who go to
this fever-den “will re-
quire to find not only the
gold, but the field for
themselves ” The region
was evidently designed
by a far-seeing Provi-
dence as a receptacle for
bank - defaulters and
Y.M.C.A. swindlers, but
an obstinate and pig-
headed generation per-
sists in calling it a mine
of wealth, and acts ac-
cordingly. Ordnary pru-
dence should have led the
prospectors to send at
least one valueless so-
oalled “ Christian ” on
ahead to test the climate,
but they neglected this
precaution, and many
good white men are likely
to find their graves at
Kimberley in conse-
quence. Out of one party
of 110 men, 30 died in
North-west Australia In a
year.
The little island of
Arran is to have a float-
ing kirk moored in Lam-
lash Bay. Any soul that
seeks to be saved will
have to be pulled on
board from the shore in
a small boat, when the
hells chime at tne kirk's
masthead. The United
Presbyterians are going
to—practically as well as
figuratively—float this
novel gospel show. Ser-
vice will, no doubt, be
conducted every Sunday
In nautical style. The
parson will preach from
the rigging in fine
weather, and a slush-
bucket will be passed
round in lieu of a plate.
The harmonium, or the
banjo, or whatever musi-
cal Instrument may be in
use, can be conveniently
placed aft of the pulpit
bulkhead, and the kirk
session will bale out the
church every Saturday,
so as to make it dry and
.comfortable. They can’t
pray on terra Urma be-
cause the sole proprietor
of the island disapproves
©f the denomination. The
proprietor of Arran is his
Grace the Duke of Hamil-
ton, United Presby-
terians may not be the
most lovable sect under
the sun, but the mon-
strous Injustice of the
treatment to which they
are subjected is none the
less apparent. The
brawny Dock of Hamil-
ton is a beauty to have
the supreme sovereignty
over saints or snivellers.
In gospel matters his
tastes must be especially
superior. The career of
this lord of the soil has
been one long chapter of
folly. As a young man
he embarassed himself
by losses on the turf,
hut got out of the hands
of the Jevs through
the accidental discovery
of a flaw in the deed of
entail which gave him
unrestricted ownership
over every acre, stone,
and stick of the Hamil-
ton possessions. (This
discovery has since been
turned to good account. Something like a quarter
of a million was realised by the sale of the Hamilton
Palace pictures and library some three years ago).
Cock-fighting and “ scrapping ” are the chief ducal
dissipations. Let us give him his due—he fights
well, and used to fight often. Perhaps he has
sobered do wn since his marriage. The Duchess of
Hamilton—daughter of a large landed proprietor
in Queensland, his Grace of Manchester—is well
suited to her lord. She was being shown round
Hamilton’s sporting retreat at Newmarket just
prior to her marriage, when the advisability of
pulling down some old barns was mooted. “ Don’t
puli them down,” said the blushing bride-elect,
“I like a day s ratting just as much as the Duke.”
The character of the man might have been judged
from his selection of a wife, quite apart from his
public exhibitions of brainless vulgarity. Two
more little family reminiscences. The father of
this present Duke of Hamilton was not so happily
wedded as his son. His own footman was a too
successful rival of hi i. The late Duke of Hamil-
ton was escorting a demimondaine down some
stairs at the Palais Hoyal when he tell and broke his
neck. His Grace was drunk at the time. Only a
short time previously he had insured his life for an
immense sum just by way of a j ike. It isn’t
necessary to dive any deeper into the pedigree of
the man who f orbids a certain church to be erected
on the Isle of Arran. If he were the most worthy
creature that ever breathed, that chance circum-
stance would in no wav lessen the iniquity of his
position as seignior. As we have pointed out, the
Hamiltons are of a kidney with the Nawcastles, of
wnom we treated the other week. What matters?
These things are part of Che English soolalsystem.
Virtue in ducal families detracts from their great-
ness rather than otherwise. Obserye. Hamilton

PRIMATE BABRY: “D—D* FUNNY, ISN’T IT?”
*“Darned.”— ED. B.
is a peer of England, Scotland, and Prance. When
this ignorant low-lived son of a debauched father
and disgraced mother married a young woman
who adores ratting, cannon were fl -ad in three
countries in celebration of the glorious event.
Such are the people who are maintained by the
Primrose League.
The members of the N.S.W. Drink Com-
mission consist of grog-men and teetotal faddists,
and are on the whole a queer lot of people. The
first question put the other day to Dr Maurice
O’Connor, who, as medical officer of Darlmghurst
prison, has an unrivalled experience in the treat-
ment of alcoholism, was: "Doesat the human
brain consist of phosphorised fat? ”
It requires real genius to introduce soul-
sclrring humour Into a municipal bye-law re the
disposal of defunct goats, but the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) Council have managed to do it. In that
town “any person who shall cast any rubbish,
dead animal or animals, with the intent of drowning,
into any public water-course,” is liable to a line,
but apparently he may throw in dead animals to
any extent, provided he does not wish in so doing
to asphyxiate the departed over again. But
a still choicer item appears in the building regula-
tions If any person in Newcastle starts to erect
a building without giving due notice, he may “be
summoned before any justice of the peace who
shall be liable ” for a daily penalty varying from £3
to £lO until the law is complied with. It must be
ruinous to be a J.P. in Newcastle, since any one of
the fraternity may be let in for paying £7O a week
beoiuse some vindictive citizen chooses to break
the law. Surely there cannot be another place on
the face of this earth where an offender is hauled
up and then the presiding beak has to pay the fine. 1
It all reminds us of Wouter van Twlller, the
Knickerbocker magistrate who, when two persons
came before him with a dispute as to accounts,
always ordered that all the account-books In the
case should be put together and then divided
equally between the parties, and that the constable
should pay the costs.
Rats are plentiful already at the alleged
Kimberley goldfield. This decides us; we are off
because we know wa can get good soup there.
Tweoty odd years ago we landed at Dunedin en
route for the diggings, and stayed at a restaurant
infested with diggers and crowded with rats. The
soup at that establishment was delicious. It was
chicken-soup every day—so at least we judged
from the nice little bones we found on our plate.
One morning we got up earlier than usual, owing
to loss of sleep caused by the resident rodents
having a quadrille party all night in our bedroom
We strolled into the backyard, and what do you
think we saw ? Pour-and-twenty big rats lying in
a row, with their heads cut off. They were laid
out on a clean plank alongside the slush-drain, and
their blood was flowing down the channel to the
bay. They had all been caught in traps, as was
evident by their bruised and broken limbs. We
pondered long and wonderingly on what might be
the meaning of this cut-throat exhibition, but gra-
dually we worked out the problem and under-
stood the mystery. That day we sat in the crowded
dining-room, with a plate of untasted soup and a
clean spoon before us, and watched with eager
curiosity the hungry miners devour the liquid,
and, like Oliver Twist, ask for more. In the
afternoon we rolled up our swag and started for
the Dunstan. Since then we have never been able
to look a rat’s tall in the tip without blushing.
Messrs. Crooks and
Wilson, the Adelaide bank
cherubim, are having the
path of sorrow strewn
with roses for their
special benefit. In some
civilised countries that
we know of this precious
pair would have been
started oit long ago to
chum in with the repent-
ant thief—or more pro-
bably with the other
thief who did not repeat.
In Mexico, for instance,
they would probably
have been requested to
climb a tree by their
necks, or at least have
been sentenced to work
in prison until their de-
falcations were made up
—a nasty way these
Aztecs have of turning
the east wind on the
shorn financier. But they
do things differently in
Australia. Crooks and
Wilson have been ad-
judged bankrupts, but by
continually adjourning
the insolvency proceed-
ings it is rendered neces-
sary to keep them la
comfortable quarter*
close at hand, instead of
sending them to pound
blue-metal at the Stock-
ade. The former was
recently visited by a holy
“• pal,” who was desirous
of administering spiritual
—or perhaps spirituous-
comfort to the prisoner,
and the much-anointed
swindler informed hla
friend that he had not
been so happy or so fre i
from mental worry for
years. A few of his vic-
tims are now in the lunt-
tic asylum, but that does
not Interfere at all with
his tranquil enjoyment.
The convicted gospel-
shark in South Australia
appears to live in the
odour of sanctity and
stewed oysters, washed ■
down with hock and
over-proof holiness. Yet
these, according to many
of our church friends,
are the sort of men they
boil down in the gildeu
hereafter to make Ih'o
potted angel or corned
seraphim.
There are evidently
a number of religion i
men in Sydney who hav .•
no appreciation of th
dignity of art, if we may
judge by the following
in the S.M. Herald:—
“ Applications to paint a
three-quarter-sized por-
trait of the Kev. G. F.
Macarthur are invitee,
and will be received b>
the undersigned on < r
before the 13th Ju 1 >
next.—J. A. Dowling, 31
Hunter-street.” Frol -
ably the Vandal who in-
serted this item among
the tenders for hous»-
painting, paper-hanging,
and the like, had no idi a
of the sacrilege he wts
committing, but we
grieve to find there io
one living being who
would thus biff the god-
dess of genius and i -
spiratlon on the nose by
means of a three-anc-
slxpenny advertisement.
The man who would send
in his tender for white-
washing three-quartei s
of a parson is unworthy
of the name of an artfi t.
Besides, there are many
difficulties to be con-
sidered, and those frienos
who have fixed their de-
sires so ardently on the
possession of a painted
clergyman have appar-
ently overlooked them
They do not give the r. i-
mensions of the uj-
painted shepherd, so It is
impossible to tender lor
him by the square fom;
nor do they mention ho**
many coats of colour he
is to receive, or whether
they wish t« have him
varnished, grained, d.s-
tempered, frescoed, <t
treated with a strict re-
gard to aerial perspective.
Nothing Is said either
about finishing him off
with a dado moulding,
but as that does not come
within the scope of the
painter and decorator,
the point may be dis-
missed without furtner
comment. Probably the
intention is that the
reverend gentleman
should be tendered lor
at so much a quarter, as
if he were mutton, but
unfortunately there is no
standard price for paint-
ing a hind-quarter of
lamb, so the problem re-
mains as unsolvable as
before.
One of the Maoleay (N.S.W.) papers has a
natural gift of apology, which other journals only
acquire by long practice. Having alluded 1 1 a
rival as “a senile apology for a newspaper” it now
repents and explains that it did not mean to say
such a thing. It only wished to point out that the
paper in question was “not a newspaper at all but
merely a second-hand placard,” Friends will
please accept this intimation. He then alludes te
the hostile editor as a “ miserable forlorn relation
of the Tasmanian Devil;” “ an impertinent larri-
kin who is afraid of his own flapdoodle;” and ”an
individual who is so deficient in brains as to be
unable to write a coherent handbill for a hawker.”
As this is an apology we would be glad to know
what the original libel was like.

The Pillory for the Saints.
I This pillory has died, and the cat-o’-nine-tails has
survived in N S. W., but no one seems to know the
reason why. The former was regarded as a valu-
able mode of moral suasion by the collective w a-
dom of England two centuries ago, and it was
frequently used In those days as a means of con-
veying enlightenment to the minds even of the
upper classes; while the cat, which also flourished
in the dark ages, served chiefly to admonish t e
mediaeval larrikin, and appealed to the finer in-
stincts of the early English pickpocket or horse-
thief. But of late years the range of punishment
has been greatly narrowed almost all over the
world, and as a result* it frequently happens that
offences are committed for which the crimina
codes provide no adequate penalty. The Otto-
mans, in bygone times. evolved an ingenious mode
of execution by which the transgressor was cut off
across the waist, and his upper and more sinful,
end kept alive afterwards for about 15 minutes by
being fixed on a plate of red-hot iron ; the ancient
Persians wiped out the particularly atrocious
criminal by smothering him slowly with ashes, or
having him eaten alive by flles-a process which
sometimes spread over a week or more ; the Ser-
vians have broken murderers on the wheel even
within the last 30 years ; but all these processes
have vanished along with the pillory, and are used
no more. But as a deterrent or curative mode of
punishment, the pillory has much to recommend
It which these other systems lacked. Even the
Turkish device alluded to could not compare with
it for experience proved it to be impossible to
create a moral reformation in a man’s stomach
when detached from his legs, or to lead his legs to
repentance apart from his “ uppers.” The pillory
in its mildest form meant punishment by disgrace
and exposure, and for that reason it was suited to
a class who cannot be adequately punished
by any system now in vogue. Solitary con-
finement is the great weapon of the law at the
present day. and the case of Edward Holt
shows, in a striking manner, how brutal and
useless it is when applied indiscriminately
Like flogging, it is, in many cases, used for the
purpose of “ bringing prisoners to their senses.”
and it has driven Holt out of his, a result which
the “barbarous” pillory might never have ac-
complished. The latter instrument has no rival
as a punishment for the fraudulent insolvent, and
the smug saint—for such men as Crooks, the Ade-
laide bank-hypocrite, and his reptile coadjutor
Wilson; for Walker, late of the Adelaide Young
Men’s Christian Association, and all the rest of the
holy tribe who rob in the name of the God of
Israel. It would have been found admirably suited
too, for the Calvinistic saints who “ managed ”
d-he'city of Glasgow Bank, and who plundered the
widow and the orphan during the six days of the
week while they snuffled prayers and doxology on
the seventh; and even Holt, who apparently has
never pretended to holiness, might show his 18*
carac crown of martyrdom in it to more advantage
than in his lonely cell at Parramatta. To the
pious swindler of the present day it is often
actual relief to hide himself in a prison until his
crime is forgotten, and the mere punishment of
confinement is far less to be dreaded than that of
exposure, with an enraged crowd to look on and
heap curses and execrations, to say nothing of
mud and rotten eggs, upon one’s dishonoured head.
The 13 months “ solitary ” which Is attached to so
many sentences shows clearly that imprisonment
alone is not efficacious, and yet in such cases as
that of Holt this “humane” dodge proves at once
barbarous and useless. The pillory, too. would
suit both the fraudulent banker and the Woolloo-
mooloo larrikin; it would have almost equal
terrors for the street ruffian and the pious Gospe
thief. Or if it were deemed absolutely necessary
to make a distinction between the two classes, we
might reach the degraded man through his feel-
ings by means of exposure, and the degraded
beast through his hide by means of the lash; but j
so long as the oat survives it is utterly 1110- |
gioal and absurd that the pillory should be
abolished. It stood in beauty side by side
with the triangles in the early days of N.8.W., and
in the pages of Barrington, the English pick-
pocket and Australian historian, we read how
criminals were placed in it with their ears nailed
to the cross-beams prior to being sent to serve
their country at Norfolk Island or YanDieman’s
Land. There are no lack of ears to-day that
deserve to be nailed to the self-same place and the
nails to fasten them there are not wanting. If the
triangles and the gallows and solitary confinement
are to survive in these colonies and if the coming
generation is to grow up beneath their grateful
shade, as the Jews did under the fig-tree and the
vine, then the pillory is wanted to make the
system complete. The enormously-increasing
tribe of canting stealers shows that no penalty
lias been yet devised which will keep the
saints of Australia in the narrow path, and
it might be well to consider if, in their
treatment of unclean holiness, our ancestors
■were not, after all, wiser than we. if brutal
punishments are to survive, let us use them dis-
criminatingly. Let us, if you will, have solitary
confinement and low diet for the savage un-
manageable ruffian who kicks the gaol-warder;
but do not let us send a man with a broken body
and a broken mind and a long sentence, to mutter
curses in a dark cell. Let us, by way of ex-
periment, put into the pillory the next saint
whom we catch robbing in the name of the Lord.
The only pretext for putting a non-refractory
prisoner into solitary confinement is that it “ gives
Mm time to think;” but we’re ready to bet that
Saint Crooks or Saint Walker would be able to
think more wholesomely in the pillory under a
shower of old eggs in five minutes than he would
think in solitary confinement in 10 years.
Haw !.—The Primrose League.
I4FE in this world would be apt to degenerate into
dreariness were it not often relieved by a con-
templation of the egregious folly and littleness of
meagre minds. Tne men, therefore, who act the
clown’s part on the stage of life are frequently
unconscious and unintentional benefactors of
their tellows. Ergo, the Rev. Canon Kemmis,
“Yicah” of Bt. Mark’s, Darling Point, Sydney;
Mr. F. Bevill, M.A., and the Rev. W. A. Glasson
are' all public benefactors, for they are helping
to plant in Sydney a “ Habitation” of the Primrose
League. It is not definitely stated 'whence the
yearn emanated to cause a demand for the kind of
thing which the aesthetic and eloquent “ vicah,”
the unaesthetic and portly schoolmaster, and the
enthusiastic Glasson are flinging around in so reck-
less a manner. The Conservative Association of
Mutual Marmaladers, otherwise known as the
Primrose League, in England, is a species of ma-
terialised hysteric, an incorporated snuffle, a
orysta'lised scream. It is a frill clandestinely
pinned on the coat-tail of politics, and has as much
to do with their course as a High Church vicar’s
biretta with everlasting salvation—as much, but
certainly not more. Men of thought and action
view its proceedings with derisive contempt; the
very party which it aspires to uphold spurns
it with scorn. The League aspires to sustain
the Constitution with a scent-bottle; to repel the
people with a primrose and a faint cough. And at
the foundation of the organization, if there can
be any foundation to a castle of straw, there is in
England unlimited snobbery and unbounded
affectation. Lady Moneygrubber, whose husband
made a huge fortune by faking army-contracts,
joins because she will then be able to sit at the
elbow of the Countess of Cadshire; and Bridget
O’Hoolagan, cook to the aforesaid Moneygrubber,
pays her five shillings that she may be in “ the
society wid the missus”; and Mary Ann the nurse-
maid pays the same amount that she may be “in
the same society wid Biddy the ugly ould cook,”
and thus the League manages to increase its mem-
bership. It Is mainly an institution of snobs, run
by help of the snobs’ servant-girls. But there is
an odour of refinement about it; and just as the
disinfectant sprinkled in a reeking gutter over-
powers for a time the native effluvium of the
noisome mass, so the aroma of “gentility ” strives
to neutralise the offensiveness of the elements
over which it is spread. Ladles of wealth and
position, tithe-fattened parsons who follow the
meek and lowly One in a coach and four, and
would-be aristocrats, who have just emerged from
a pawn-office, or butter-packing shop, are the
prominent members, and the sinews of war are
drawn from cads in the kitchen, and patriots in
plush. The Mutual Marmaladers affect titles.
“ Knights ” and “ dames ” are created at a cost of
something like five shillings; other dignities
are granted at fixed rates, and these en-
noblements all help to enrich the League’s
Treasury, in the same way that the baronetcies
which James I. sold, supplied him with the means
of gratifying his royal whims. But it is time to
come to the Sydney imitation of this gorgeous
wen on the neck of fl unkeydom. From a printed
circular we learn that this choice exotic brought
out from England by the Imperial Osborn to be
planted in Australia, “ will contemplate no concern
with local party politics.” The terms of this de-
claration are not exactly clear, for it is difficult to
understand how the League can “ contemplate ” a
“concern” with anything, but we presume that
this is the expression of an intention to avoid dis-
cussion of local politics. The League Is entirely
foreign, and its business is equally so. All that it
asks of Australia is a sufficiency of flunkeys to
keep it going and pay the expenses of the show.
We do not for a moment doubt that these latter
will he forthcoming. Tne League in Australia, as
in England, will be an asylum for the socially
destitute. In the future, every Potts Point aris-
tocrat whose grandmother or grandfather was a
convict ; every rich young lady whose father
achieved opulence by means of a lucrative con-
nection with sly grog-selling; every man or
woman whose reputation is clouded by recent pro-
ceedings in the Divorce Court; in fine, every
wealthy snob who for any reason finds himself or
herself unable to obtain admission to “sasslety,’’
will join this League in the hope of making it a
stepping-stone to the mansions of the fashionable.
After all, Mr. J. L. Osborn, the missionary of Eng-
lish political aestheticism, knew what he was about.
He brought out the banner, trusting to
Sydney to supply flunkeys enough to march
after it, and he will not be disappointed.
The alma of the League are stated with a wide
generality that means anything or nothing, with a
strong bias ,in favour of the latter. In religious
matters “all bigotry and intolerance,” are to be
avoided. But how, oh Reverends Kemmis and
Glasson, can you belong to such an organisation ?
Do not your Articles and your creeds affirm that all
persons who worship not, or believe not, in
accordance therewith, without doubt shall perish
everlastingly ? How then can you—prof easing doc-
trines which pull the Anglican up to Heaven with
one hand and push all other worshippers down to
Sheol with the other—adhere to your own faith,
and be aught else than bigoted and Intolerant ?
Either you are not Anglicans, or else you are-
well, you can guess the other alternative. But
the League is to “ endeavour to grapple success-
fully with the atheism of the present day.”
“ Grapple successfully ” with it ? In other words,
the crowd of brainless dolts and doltesses
whose flva-shillingses are now to be raked
in, are about to bolt a door with a
boiled carrot, and stop a whirlwind with
pageantry and primroses. The concluding para-
graph of this gorgeous circular deserves quota-
tion in full. It runs thus :
“In secular matters, the Primrose League ad-
vocates the maintenance of the Constitution, the
Imperial ascendency of England in the Councils ot
Europe, and the guarantee to every man of his own
property."
In their fervid desire for the maintenance of the
Constitution, the leaguers are intensely Conserva-
tive, but they have a bold Radicalism in their
spelling. When, we would ask, did “ ascendancy ”
first acquire an “e” in the penultimate ? In the
last-named object, the securing of his own pro-
perty to everyone, we are heartily with the Prim-
rose people, if they really intend what the words
mean. Land, the property of the people, has been
for too long monopolised in England by the
wealthy, and usually corrupt few. The present
English system enables one man to grab a
whole county, worth millions, and out of the
revenue derived therefrom he pays a few fawn-
ing, loafing Anglican parsons to swear that he
shuts out the many from their just inheritance
by force of an inalienable because divine right.
If Mr. Osborne and his colleagues aspire
to break down the national system which results
in the direct and impious robbery of the toiling
millions. The Bulletin is with them; but we do
not suppose that they have any such Intention.
1 Their very Conservatism is a guarantee that they
I mean to take no steps towards dethroning
the vast category of ancient abuses, or re-
pressing the crimes, of the English social
system. These cultured clerics and haughty
aristocrats of Potts Point possibly admire the
laws which in England enable a vicah who Is
also a J.P. to sentence a man to six months for
staying hunger’s pangs by taking a hare in the
grounds of the land-monopoliser by whom this
vicar was appointed, and on whom he also lives-
These aristocratic political farceurs possibly love
the national system which deprives millions of the
opportunity of earning an honest living, aid the
meets the theft of a green turnip with a sentence
of six months’ hard labour. These are social
conditions and incidents which the British Conser-
vatives form Primrose Leagues to sustain, and
these are the national cancers they would seek to
inflict upon Australia. For one reason we are
glad to notice that a Primrose Habitation has been
started in Sydney. It must necessarily be a para-
dise for snobs, a nirvana for wealthy flunkeys
and by scanning the list of members we shal be
able the more easily to identify the representatives
of these two classes. It would be too much to say
that none who do not belong to either order will
be *' knights ” and “ dames,” but those who are not
snobs or flunkeys will be almost bereft of congenial
companions when they sit with a crowd of their
fellow members.
A Moslem Grievance.
Religious equality appears to be rather at a dis-
count in Victoria, and a small handful of Mel-
bourne Mohammedans are sitting down sadly to
inquire of each other, in various Asiatic lan-
guages, if things are really what they seam or if
visions are about. A few days ago these pilgrim
strangers desired to celebrate the feast of “Id,
and applied in due form to a Government official
for permission to assemble in one of the public
parks. Tats the hon. Jaok-in-offlce contemp-
tuously declined to grant, and, consequently, the
observances had to be performed on a piece of
waste land on the St. Kllda Road, to the Rreat
entertainment of a crowd of deranged larrikins,
who watched the proceedings. Why the Moslem
should be treated with so much less consideration
than the Salvationist does not exactly appear.
The former is a peaceful citizen, who expects to
have 73 wives when he goes to Heaven; the latter
is a very noisy one, whose great aim appears to be
to bang on 73 big drums while here on earth. The
religion of the followers of the Prophet is a very
quiet and unassuming one, while that of their
rivals is composed mainly of banjo, collec-
tion - plate* hallelujah, and hell-flre. The
Mohammedan prays five times a day, but
he does not hall his deity as if the latter were
perched on the main-royal in a howling north-east
gale, while he is trying to make himself audible
from underneath six feather beds at the bottom of
the hold. In fact ha very often satisfies himself
with merely writing his devotions on a sheet of
foolscap, anl then carries the dog-eared prayer
about la his pocket for weeks afterwards until it
is impregnated with the odour of sanctity and
long-cut Turkish. He does not lie awake on his
stomach all night either, trying by the aid of a
tallow candle to devise some new form of cussed-
ness by which he will next day persuade a whole
suburb that a murderer, a lunatic, and live hydro-
phobic dogs are on the loose, when after all it is
only one bilious sinner trying to repent; nor does
he perform scriptural sand-j igs on the boards of his
third-floor-backbedroom, or put his head o ut of the
window in the small hours of the morning to
hail the passing policeman and enquire if
he has found the Lord. He does not empty halle-
lujah slops from his window either, on the heads
of unoffending passers-by, as one Salvationist re-
cently did, and then explain at the police-court
that he was praying at the time, and was conse-
quently not accountable for his aetlons; nor has
he a divine mission which leads him to play wild
Oriental jokes on unfortunate invalids, by strik-
ing up his tuneful jawbone beneath their win-
dows. Yet his rivals with the big drum and the
war whoop do all these things; and in addition,
they publish a newspaper, and scalp the bleeding
spectre of Dr. Watts, by producing in its columns
original “ poems ” which, for sentiment and feel-
ing, compare very badly with a mortgage deed or
an Insolvency Act, and no one seems to interfere
much with their proceedings. The Salvationists
warfare with the devil may, of course, be very in-
teresting to the combatants, but in a fight where
both sides seem about equally respectable we pre-
fer to howl for the dog that is undermost; and
moreover, it appears absurd to spend so much
effort to wipe out the flre-and-brimstone man,
if he is to leave the Salvation Army behind
to carry on his business. The Moslems have
a devil also, but he is a quiet and playful
animal with only one horn ani a short
tail, and he does not seem to have that bad habit
of stirring up sinners with a red-hot fork which
marks his Christian brother, so it is quite unne-
cessary to get up military demonstrations against
him. For the present, however, it appears that
the peaceful Asiatics must take a back seat, for
the men with the Bible and the banjo seem to have
both the law and the profits on their side. This
state of things, however, cannot last for ever.
Christian morals have sunk so low in Australia
that nothing short of wholesale conversion to a
new faith can redeem the character of the colo-
nists, and having sampled a large number of care-
fully bottled creeds, we unhesitatingly pronounce
that of the Prophet to be the best. In the
seven-storied Moslem hell, the basement floor
—where the heating apparatus is kept—is spe-
cially reserved for hypocrites, and a religion
which plants gentlemen of that class in the imme-
diate vicinity of the stoke-hole is peculiarly
adapted to this country. Moreover, the Young
Men’s Mohammedan Association does not turn out
an annual crop of swindlers as does its Christian
prototype; nor do Mohammedan larrikins loaf at
every street-corner, and send forth their playful
howl and oath to the breeze; the followers of the
Arab sage are not picked up drunk from tne
gutter and run in by orthodox policemen; and
there is something in his creed which keeps the
Moslem from snuffling piety abroad and pouncing
his wife at home. We are glad to observe, there-
fore, that the Faithful at Melbourne are about to
import a Mollah from India with a view to ~
ing their doctrines, and if we can help t he holy
man in the work of introducing some kind of real
religion for the first time into Australia, our
services are entirely at his disposal.

the heathen at silverton.
We take the following extract from the
lately-issued report of that valuable body the
N.S.W. Bible Society. It is just delicious. Voild:—
“Your committee have always recognised the
obligation which rests upon them to promote
Bible circulation in Australia and to see that the
heathen at our own doors are provided with the
Word of Life. Under this conviction they have
contributed the sum of £3O for colportage at SIP
verton, a mining township 800 miles from Sydney.
• « . Bor six months the colporteur worked at
this place.” For six months, and was not thrown
down a shaft or ground to grease in a mill I Well,
miners are getting to be confoundedly humane,
not to say turnip-hearted, compared with what
they were in the good,old times. Yet perhaps
they are right. Yes, they are when we come to
think of it. A few stanzas—
Among the noble instincts implanted by
Providence in the human breast few are more
striking: in their grandeur, or more deeply Im-
pressive in their results, than that which leads a
white man to kick a Chinaman whenever the
opportunity and the Chinaman present themselves.
The action marks the revolt of reason, intellect,
energy, civilisation and hob-nailed boots against
opium and barbarism; it denotes in a striking
manner the supremacy of the great Anglo-Saxon
race; it stimulates trade by repressing Mongol
competition: and as it furnishes the only adequate
check against the irruption of the Asiatic hordes*
it is a custom which deserves the support of all
true patriots. The effect on the kicked party, also,
is very gratifying, for a Chinanan who has been
kicked is worth at least two who have not. These
considerations, however, appear not to be fully
appreciated by the Tamworth magistrates. At
that town, a few days ago, Jimmy Chingj sued
Alfred Thomson for damaging his weather-'bye,
and, further, sticking a pin in that part of his
anatomy which faces the east when he turns his
face to the setting sun, while engaged in knee-
drill at the Salvation Army. Jimmy, it appears,
was kneeling in the ring, when the defendant, who
was trying to shove himself in near the throne
of grace, used the pin as a means of making him sit
up. Ching then remarked “ Me don’t want devils,
me want Salvasha,” but while he was finish-
ing this edifying sentiment he was stonewalled
in the eye. According to the defence, however,
Thomson was peacefully standing hla umbrella
up against the ark of the covenant when the
Chinaman endeavoured to buck him out of the
circle, and it must be acknowledged that the spec-
tacle of a yellow man ejecting a Caucasian is one
which is calculated to rend the Empire asunder.
Ching seems to have been considerably shaken up
in the struggle which ensued, and at last, with his
hat gone and his pigtail Hying in the wind, he
turned his attention to a man named Bible, with the
apparent intention of kicking the Apocrypha out
of him, and knocking his evangelical remains
into the middle of Abraham’s bosom. Why the
P.M. should have seen fit to fine the defendant 40s.
and costs under such circumstances, it is difficult
to understand, especially when we remember that,
according to old established custom, it Is the privi-
lege of every European to kick a Chinaman when-
ever he can get a square run at him. Possibly there
were other circumstances Involved which were not
reported, but to judge by the evidence given in
the local paper, it seems as if the ends of Justice
would have been best served by ordering the
Mongol to be officially kicked by the Clerk of
Petty Sessions, and then run out by the senior
constable, after which the case might very well
have been dismissed.

The local option poll at Rockhampton
(Q.) has ended in a triumph for those who love to
gaze on the frothing porter and fill high the bowj
with shandygaff. The righteous men of the land
rolled up in all their force, but they were very

drunkard to demolish them,
And their numbers were like the omnivorou

All that fateful day the grog-blossomed noses

polling-booth, and reflected a baleful light as the

zens,malodorous citizens,all were there. The distant
bushman galvanised his steed into new life, and gal-
loped in to strike for freedom; the publican and
the sinner voted straight for the same cause; so did
the local brewer, and the policeman, and the
corner loafer, and the habitual drunk, and the
man who uses obscene language, and the party
who sleeps on the hotel verandah, and the man
with no legs, and the other man with no visible
means of support, till the 10 just citizens of Rock-
hampton retired in despair. And now a beery
jubilee is in progress In that dreary town on the
FJzroy River, the fountains of the great deep are
broken up, and it promUea tj ra.n wbi.ky lor 40

join in the chorus. “ Lot soioo droppings fall on

The hat to help distress,
Who flings freo-handedly his pound,
Or shilling, more or less,
Just as he “ holds ” it, with line phlegm,
Smug saints whose psalm upsoars ?
Not much. You bet your life, not them—
The heathen at their doors.
Yet, men of Sllverton, you’re right
To spare that colporteur—

“Ted” Evans again came off in the Not-
tlngham match, am until particulars are received
from headquarters we shall remain In mystery as
to why he was left out of the test match. Speak-
ing of Brans' bowling in the Surrey match, an
English paper says:—“The Australians fairly
earned their reputation for doing big things at
the finish of a match. Special praise may be given
to Evans He bowled all through the Surrey
innings from the Gasworks wicket, and it would
be scarcely an exaggeration to say that in his 41
overs there were not half-a-dozen bad balls. He
has as accurate a pitch as even Alfred Shaw in his
best days. His bowling on Saturday was some
compensation for the unavoidable loss of Spof-
forth's services.” There are rumours that the
Australian Eleven is not quite such a haupy
family as it might be, and reported heavy wag rs
as to the number of wickets taken by respeutlv
bowlers do not tend to strengthen ih« confidence
of the Australian public in their representatives.
Allowing Evans was fit and willing to play, it is
the general opinion of the cricketing public that
he should have been included in the best Austra-
lian eleven now available in England.

But a moderate attendance put in an ap-
pearance at the Sydney Association Ground on
Saturday, when N.S.W. met and defeated Victoria
in football under British Association rules. The
game is all leg play, and should prove a great im-

account of Its comparative gentleness, but we do
not think it is likely to find much favour amongst
the present generation of Sydney footballers,

Under Rugby rules the Gordons added
another to their already long list of victories, by
defeating Burwood by 5 points to nil. They have
improved much in their play, and are now, with-
out doubt, a really fine team; and as matters
stand, are top of the list for the Gardiner Cup,
with every probability of becoming the holders
at the end of the season. Their record is a slash-
ing one-not a club succeeding in “doing ” them—
and included in their score is a win against the
University early In the season. Unfortunately no
return match is on the card between these cracks,
but as each is most anxious for another brush, it
is to be hoped some arrangement may be arrived
at by which to give them a second trial. The
'Varsity record is far from a bad on*?, their only
defeat being at the hands, or rather feet, of the
Gordons, and should they again meet their victors,
we are amongst the many who believe the students
would now just about put the Gordons through

The team selected to represent “ All Eng-
land” in the Manchester match included a larger
proportion of professional players than any pre-
vious combination eleven. As we remarked a few
weeks ago, the amateurs (so called) are no longer
the cream of English cricketing talent, ana it
would even seem that the somewhat unpalatable
truth has at last dawned upon the big-wigs who
choose "All England” teams. At the present
moment there Is not a single gentleman-bowler
whose form is anything approaching that of the
best professionals, and it will be observed that in
the match under notice neither Grace nor Steel
was credited with a wicket. For the matter of
that, Peate seems to have failed with the ball, and
was consequently a mere passenger in the boat, a
very different class of tail-man to Spotfortb, who
rattled up 20 (not out) when seven of the cracks
htd been previously disposed of for a grind total
of 19. A bowler like Peate is a terrible weakness
to a team. If the ground doesn’t exactly suit his
pitch. Massie used to say that a batsman could
want nothing better than to play the Yorksnire-
man on a dry wicket. It was through placing too
reliance on Peate’s bowling, and omitting to
include some of the more reliable truudlers, that
the Englishmen got such a fearful leatner-hunting
at tne Oval in 1884. After ihe Manchester success
we shall be Interested to see whether the Maryle-
fcone Club people will endeavour to improve upon
that eleven for the matches at Lord s a.jd the Oval,
If they make any substituti ns beyond, say Barnes

I “ 1 am perfectly willing to give a handsome

tfcat every member of each club having so much
physical energy to spare will give an assurance
that, before joining in the sport, they had at-
tended to every domestic requirement, such as
chopping wood, digging the garden, and trim-
ming up their places of abode. Then, and not
till then, should they be entitled to kick to their
hearts’ content.” Misguided man! Has he not
learned that the passion for kicking something
is implanted iu every Australian breast 1 It is a
taste which must be catered for at any cost. Only

mannered and affectionate, was overcome by the
athletic frenzy in the still small hours of the

The Referee remarks that champion-
sculler Beach has done well to exhibit himself for
pay at the London music-halls before rowing any
races. “ Because, you see, on the strength of his
two victories over Hanlan, ho has a high commer-
cial or Commercial-street value. But if he did
not happen to win when ho does race, what wculd
be his worth for a few turns per night at the Lon-
don Palaces ? Not enough to pay the hire of the
brougham, without which no well-regulated
music-hall star of the mildest effu'gence is half
complete.”
The West Australian Nigger.
Rev. J. D. G kibble, Church of England mis-
sionary in Western Australia, is at least a little bit
like a real primitive Christian, so, of course, local
society has begun to kick him and spit upon him.
For years and years the treatment dealt out by
the so-called Christian Government and settlers
and judges and juries of Western Australia has
cried aloud for vengeance. The law and the
settlers have relentlessly hanged and flogged
and murdered and enslaved the blacks. The police
have shot aboriginal men and women and children
like native dogs for small offences against the
sacred rights of property. The blacks are hunted
down in the wilds like emus or kangaroos, and
driven off to be kept in bondage as labourers in
the pearl-shelling industry, and when t aey abscond
they are, for breaking “agreements” into which
they have compulsorily entered, and the provisions
whereof they never understood, sent to gaol at
Rottnest Island-a fever-den from which few
blacks ever return. In some cases they are sen-
tenced to a period In irons, coupled neck to neck
and chained to gum-trees day after day aid week
after week. Mr. Grlbble tells of a case in which
seven natives were chained to each other and to a
cartwheel, and were then flogged with a stock-
whip until the blood was fl iwing in streams from
their naked backs. The same kind of treatment
is inflicted for other offences, such as stealing
rations or killing sheep, which they are frequently
driven to by hunger, in consequence of the white
men having taken possession of their country and
driven away their game. Hundreds of native
girls and women are captured lor the worst pur-
poses. The Government of the country is in the
hands of a few families, and there Is no hope for
the blacks. The settlers interested in the perpetu-
ation of this murder and slavery system boyo itted
Mr. Grlbble when he tried to establish a mission
station until he couldn’t get a bit to eat ; and when
Hon. Alex. Forrest kindly offered help they boy-
cotted Mr. Forrest's station also. Mr. Grlbble Is a
kindly, well-meaniag man, but he is kicking
against the pricks. He is living la a practical age in
which the priest and the deacon go up to the Temple
but once a week—to rake in the collection. "Feed my
sheep ” now means turn out the nigger so that the
white mam’s pedigree-jumbucks may be pastured
on the land of the aboriginal. It also means form a
Potts Point or Toorak branch of the Primrose
League, In order that hungry old women may be
sent to gaol, in England, for stealing raw vege-
tables from the rich landlord hard by. Our advice
to Pastor Grlbble is not to make a fool of himself
We, of the Eastern colonies, have cleared off the
blackfellows so thoroughly, and made them so
scarce, that whenever a stray drunken nigger
vagrant dies now-a-days, half-a-dozen surgeons
struggle to get his skull for some museum or
other. By the alchemy of greel we have changed
the blood of the blackfellow into the gold we
jingle in our pockets, and any man who, like Mr*
Grlbble, comes to the churches in the East-
churches whose bishops but the other day lifted
up their voices and asked God to bless the murder
of Arabs In the Soudan—for help for the yet un-
slaughtered blackfellows in the West, Is only
gnawing a file.

, -Juclge and the Misses Josephson enter-
tained a very large number of people at a fancy
dress ball in Sydney Town Hall ontbe evening of
7th July. Nearly all the guests appeared in ex-
tremely handsome fancy costumes, and the event
"'▼ill long be remembered as a most delightful suc-
cess. The hall was tastefully decorated. Herr
Patek’s band supplied excellect music, and the
arrangements were la every way perfect. About
tolnb o’clock the room was crowded, and then
there wore to be seen kings, cooks, postmen,
huntsmen, cavaliers, jockeys, Turks,&o„ begging
for the programmes of Queens, duehtfises, village-
maids, gleaners, flsh-w.ives, shepherdesses, milk-
maids, «3,, until the strains of the band warned
them th&t the was beginning. Amongst
those assembled w are the Mayor and Miss Young,
liady Hay*, Lady and the Mieses Manning, the Hon.
IP. B, Suitor, Mr. and Mrs. Mort, Mr. E. W. Wal-
Bpston, Captain Sheriffe, Captain Terry, Lord
Bertie, Captain Brooke (H M.S. Opal), Mr. Stuart,
R.N. Miss Jcsephson wore a handsome black
costume, with patches and powder ; her sister was
a great success as “Portia”; Miss Annie Man-
ning, ingeniously costumed as “Rabbit-girl,”
was the admiration of all present; Miss Aus-
tin, as a “ Masher Postman,” was “as nice as you
make them”; Mrs. Cohen was an extremely pretty
little “ Cupid ”; and Mrs. Purves looked very hand-
some as the “Grand Duchess of Gerolsteiu”; Mrs.
Henry White’s artistic and original choice of
“Truth ” was immensely admired; and Mies Simp-
Son looked very charming as “ Stars and Stripes ” {
Miss Throckmorton, as “Lady Teafile,” wore a hand-
some drejs; Miss Cruiokshank’s Fishwife attire
suited her to perfection; Mrs. Monteflore looked
very well as a Turkish lady; and Mr. Monteflore,
fts a Chinaman, was an acknowledged success;
Mr. Fred Orr did not fail in impersonating a noble
Frenchman; Mr- Sachs was conspicuous and ad-
mired as CoeUr de Lion; Mr. Ernest Cox looked a
thorouga jockey; and Mr. Bernard Wise, an appe-
tising cook; Mr J. Allison aspired to Blr Walter
Raleigh; Sir Edward Strickland was a great sue
cess aa an English foihunter; Captain Sheriff
looked capital in a hunting costume, and Mr.
Charles Biilyard was a very good, French marquis.

At the Bihth raoe-meeting, held at Rose-
hill, last Saturday, the ladies presented a very
fashionable appearance, and showed to advantage
on the well-kept lawn some tasteful and handsome
toilettes. Dark serges and tailor-made dresses
were chiefly chosen, and hats were most predomi-
nant, very few bonnets being worn.
* ♦ ♦
Some new features are discernible in
the make of ladies’ dresses at present, especially
Short Costumes, either for day or evening wear.
The plain, full skirts are itebs full than they were,
hnd the two sides of the bodice are seldom, if ever,
trim hied alike. An extremely pretty example is
to havh fth underskirt of dark velvet edged with a
fhhes-inch-wide border of gold and silk passemen-
terie, and for that to be brought up the side in two
rows, as if the skirt opened there, and then the
surah or foulard that forms the toflice and upper
drapery can be gracefully arranged over it in
points. The newest evening drefeses are exceed-
ingly fascinating—bnb In pale mauve, or helio-
trope, is a succession of three materials laid over
each other. First there is a pale silk underskirt
clotted with pendants of silver beads; over this is
k skirt of white lace embroidered with silver, and
over this again a deeper shade of poult de sole.

mittee. Dancing was kept up until nearly 18
o’clock, and a thoroughly enjoyable evening was
spent by all present. The dresses worn by the
young ladles on this occasion were certainly not
above the average, and would not bear close criti-
cism. This was, no doubt, owing to the wet

On July Ctb, Mn and Mrs. Fullford enter-

peared in beautiful fancy costumes, the most
noticeable being: Miss Fallford, as “Queen Anne,’
in a brocaded satin petticoat, crimson satin and
black velvet bodice, with panier trimmed with
gold braid, jewelled crown and sceptre; Miss M.
Fullford, “ Lady Jane Grey,” a beautiful costume;
Master Fullford, “Prince Charles,” crimson velvet
doublet with slashed sleeves and cream satin
breeches; Master H. Button, a perfect Hamlet;
Master George Long, a beautifully-dressed Pirate
King; Mr. M. Long, a very effective dress of a
Greek Elder; M. A. Greagh, “ Domine Samson”;
Master Gannon, " Bunthorne ”; C. Taylor, a
•‘Masher’’; Miss Kenall, " Harvest”; Misaßibby,
a most fascinating Ducnets of Devonshire;

numerous Fish Wives, Red Riding Hoods, &0., &o.
The adults, who were all in plain evening dress,
wound up the ball, and alter a most enjoyable
time, numerous carriages provided by the amiable
host and hostess conveyed the guests to their

Mayor Young is about to make—doubtless
unknowingly- a great bid for honours. As a rule,
when a man goes for a baronetcy, he makes at
least a pretence of personal merit. He claims to
have done something, from paying the debts of an
impecunious Governor to sending other people to
bleed and rot for him In the Soudan. But John
knows better. He’s going to play four aces, and
clear the board. At the fancy-dress ball he Is
giving, he is going to spot the best-looking and
best-dressed of his guests, and, having pnoto-
graphed them, present them to the Queen I The
plan has all the merit of simplicity.

A musical event, from which much was ex-
pected, took place in Hobart on sth Inst , when a
“Packer” festival was held, the entertainment
consisting entirely of the compositions of the
local musician, Mr. F. A. Packer. Very little en-
thusiasm was shown, aad the general effect was
disappointing, as the dirge- ike melancholy and
sameness always noticeable in Mr. Packer’s songs
were intensified by the rendering of so many ia
succession. The composer’s instrumental items
pianoforte solos—have all a monotonous musical-
box effect, and are extremely irritating to a critical
audience. Quantity, not quality, seems to have
been Mr. Packer’s motto, aad, judging from his
compositions, he appears to have taken a morbid
delight In misery. The originators of the festival
guarded against possible failure by securing the
services of the. most popular amateur vocalists,
and to their efforts may mainly be ascribed its
partial success, 1 i

A number of gentlemen met last week to

Messrs. Brady and M‘Cirthy were elected secre-

ball should be held in the Exhibition Building on

At the late 4th of July ball at Sydney, a
leading citizen found he was to dance with Lady
Carlngton. There was no getting out of it for
either party, so the gentleman went info training.
He took long dancing-latsons, and perspired much
—partly from fatigue, but chiefly from appre-
hension. After a week’s terrible study, he called
la his friends-chiefly female—and gave them a
full-dress rehearsal; they hypocritically said “ he’d
do.” When the awful night came, the leading
citizen walked into the room, and in the course of
the evening took the floor with her ladyship.
Then the fun began—but not for the gentleman,
who found that the lessons were simply money
out of pocket. No man ever looked more relieved
when the music ceased and ended his agony.

The N.B.W. cavalry tournament, spoken
of last week, is really to come off on August 11.
Lord Carlngton la to take a part, but we have it
on good authority that his part will be that of a
spectator. Ours will be, too. We were not so far
wrong when we spoke of tne “spills” these wild
hussars indulge In, as only the other day a gallant
major tell off his horse at Moore Park. He did not
care. It was a minor act in the drama.

By the way* the League’s great trouble will be to

mounted by young ladies of the “upper-crust ”

to members the bunches they gather with their

This extraordinary item of news appears
in a Melbourne paper. “Lady Carlngton* who
was out at the hunt last week, looking very much
out of condition, has since changed hands and is
now under the care of Mr. W. A. Pilgate, who will
soon effect an improvement in her appearance.”
Her ladyship may be a little out of condition,
what with receptions and municipal addresses and
other tribulations, but respect for vice-royalty
will not allow us to admit that anyone could effect
an Improvement in her present appearance.
Either W. A. Pilgate is a lucky, lucky dawg, or

There are numerous enquiries as to the
whereabouts of a certain “lord,” who recently
visited these colonies, got into “the very best
society, my dear”—and had ’em all on toast. His
alleged lordship, whose name was good enough
for anything, and whose authenticity was never
for an instant doubted, was most successful in
worming himself into the confidence of a variety
of old ladies with marriageable daughters, and he
was especially clever in paying his addresses-a
man must live somehow, donoherknow—to the
proprietresses of “ hash-horses.” Gone like a

The next time the Queen wants to spoil a
good man she should be advised to select Mr.
QuongTart. Mr. Tart is always doing good. Tnat
he is oenevolent and useful, no doubt reduces his
chances of getting a baronetcy, and that he con-
fines his charitable acts to feeling quietly the
poor and needy, or treating asylum children by
the hundred, is dead against him. Still, the time
may come when he will see the error of his ways,
and, leaving the path of charity, take to the high
road o f grovelling. However, so long as he remains
unimbued with European notions, and carries
the same honest benevolent heart, he must expect
to remain on the strict Q.T. without a handle to

England stands a chance of getting a new
poet in Stanley Weall, if she will omy refrain from
making him a Peer until he is 60—she may then de-
grade him as she likes. In “ Babylon Bound
there is a great deal of real poetry as far removed
from commonplace verse as Tennyson the Com-
moner is from Tennyson the Peer. The songs in
the volume are admirable, and very singable—the
rhythms strong, rough, and flowing. Stanley Wea 1
should make a name if he keeps out of the literary
“sets” into which the London book-world is now

Some Tasmanian ladies—tired, probably,
of twirling their thumbs and crying “Heigh, ho!
for a husband ” —have had a sudden fit ot loyalty,
which takes the form of a presentation to the
Princess of Wales. This consists of a hand-painted
screen—now on view in Hobart. It is a particu-
larly commonplace piece of furniture, wretchedly
painted, (badly arranged, and evidently a home-
made affair altogether. Unnatural-looking groups
of the berries indigenous to Tasmania, clemat s
nearly devoid of leaves, and fish decidedly out ot
water, are the objects depicted thereon—the back
finished off with ordinary wall-paper, cracked and
torn in many places, and the whole surmounted
with ugly little excrescences covered with gold
paint. According to the opinion of most ladies
with average good taste, a bonfire would be a
more suitable destination for this monstrosity
than Sandringham, but the donors are satisfied,
and it is to be forwarded—“ Prom the ladles or

Burwood (N.S.W.) was haloed with en-
thusiasm on Wednesday, 7th last., when Miss
A ice Maude Beaumont, fourth daughter of Mr.
W. Beaumont, said “I will,” to that always in-
teresting question—propounded on this occasion
in St. Luke s Church, Concord, by Canon Moreton,
assisted by Dean Bromby, Mr. Walter L. Taylor,
son of the late Hamlet Taylor, being the other
patty primarily interested. The native rugged-
nsaa of the church-walls was masked by neatly-
disposed festoons of flowers evergreens, and
the organ-rail was resplendent with a floral medal-
lion and fitting motto. The church was well filled
with visitors, who came in spite of the treachery of
the weather, and the aggressive adhesiveness of
Burwood mud. The bride, who entered with
her father was more than usually charming in her
cream Gros Royal robe heavily trimmed with lace
and pearl, and carried a magnificent bouquet of
white camellias and the customary
a ims. Her train-bearers were Messrs. Albert and
Colin Beaumont, who wore navy-blue velvet suits
Of the bridesmaids, two, Miss Louise and Miss
Jane Beaumont, wore pale-blue mervellleux with
cream lace trimmings and caps to match; Miss
Emma Beaumont and Miss Leila Taylor, the latter
a sister of the bridegroom, cream mervellleux
with pearl lace trimmings and caps; and Miss
Margaret and Miss Isabel Beaumont, pink nun s
veiling trimmed with satin. Each of the
bridesmaids carried bouquets harmonising In
colour with the prevailing shade of her cos-
tume. Breakfast at Arthurslelgb. the resi-
dence of the bride, followed, the Impor-
tant toast being submitted by Canon Moreton.
Katoomba was chosen for the honeymocm.
The wedding presents formed au Imposing
array and evoked a great deal of admira-
tion. The festivities concluded with a ball
attended by nearly 300 guests. The arrangements
were excellent, and the floor as near perfection as
can be attained in this world of woe and waltz ng.
The ball-room, speola'ly built for Its purpose, and
very handsomely fitted, opened on to enclosed
verandahs, lighted with the usual Chinese lan-
terns, with a refreshment-room conveniently
placed at one end. Including extras, 39 dances
were on the programme, and the milkman was on
his matutinal round before the music of the
twinkling feet was silenced. Among the ladles
present at the breakfast or ball were the Misses
Buokland (Melbourne), In navy-blue and brown
cashmere, trimmed with plush ; Mrs. Hamlet
Taylor, In black mervellleux; Mrs.Beaumont,grey
satin, trimmed with ruby velvet; Miss Taylor,

Yet another “court-martial” on account
of a member of that high-toned corps, the Sydney
Lanceahs. The silly affectations of this much-
tlnselled company of opulent and pretentious Im-
perialistic swashbucklers have, in the past, af-
forded much joy to the brainless females who wor-
ship unfleshed swords, and bow down before uni-
forms that have never been spattered by anything
than beer and gravy. The rest of the community
are alike amused and disgusted at eternally
hearing that a set of overfed oarpet-war-
rlors are squabbling amongst themselves like
a pack of tea-drinking old women. If the
Lanceahs must quarrel, let them quarrel like
genuine cavalrymen. The authorities of New
Caledonia, which is within a few days’ steam,
would put no unreasonable obstacle in the way of
a combat to the death. The Messagerles steamers
are very pleasant to travel by, and we dare say
the company would refund half the price of the
return-ticket taken by the warrior who got killed

The late railway smash in Tasmania has
come very near to depriving that colony of Its
most important luminaries. Almost every pro-

The Church has been bumped in the head and

and two or three of Its legs damaged, the Daw Is
covered with bruises, and one or two other pro-

blood. Parliament, too, appears to have been
considerably illused, and the Cabinet has been
knocked about to such a degree that It is fesred
the Government will have to be conducted
on crutches for a few weeks, at all events. The
moral of all ihls Is, that In future, when the
Ministry wants to travel, It had better be taken to
pieces and sent forward In detachments. To risk

Serious complaints aremadeby the judges
and barristers, whose business is In Melbourne
Supreme Court, about the hardness of the seats
provided for their use. We sympathise with them
sincerely. In fact, we go further. We think that,
in a civilised age like the present, the ridiculous
old notions about dignity being incompatible with
ease and comfort should be knocked on their
hoary heads. They are merely relics of barbarism
—a species of Draconic tradition which compels
them to be clothed with majesty and mystery, as
with an overcoat. But we think the time has
arrived when all that sort of nonsense—wigs and
gowns included—should be done away with. We
would oven fit the dock up with arm-chairs and
spittoons, so that the poor prisoners might have
a little comfort before they—to use a novel ex-
pression— are consigned to durance vue. The
people who have the arranging of these matters
should think of this. They may be prisoners them-
selves one day. You can never tell what may
happen in these times.

Mr. Patrick White, M.A., of State school
No. 391, Melbourne, was last week presented with
a valuable service of plate (on the subscription-
list for which were some Sydney names) by his
colleagues and old pupils on the occasion of his
retirement from the public service. Mr. White, in
acknowledging the gift, remarked that he hoped
that he had done the State some service by bring-
ing up many of its sons in a path creditable to
themselves and satisfactory to his own humble
exertions. Wherever he looked throughout the
length and breadth of Australia, he found ac-
quaintances, most of whom, he was proud to say,
were successfully established in life, while others
had still to achieve the position achieved by their
seniors. He could not but regret parting from a
field of labour with which he had been so long and
busily engaged, but the regret was alleviated by
the kind and thoughtful recognition of his many
friends, as evinced by their handsome testimonial.

The tickets for the Brisbane Liedertafel
are something quite gorgeous—deep-rosa colour
and gold lettering.

On 7th inst. the first ball, under the aus-
pices of the Amalgamated Licensed Victuallers’
Association of N.8.W., was held in the Now
Masonic Hall, Sydney. The hall was handsomely
decorated for the occasion, and the rich and hand-
some dresses of the ladies made a brilliant and
very successful picture. About 400 were pre-
sent, so that the room was comfortably filled for
dancing. Noticeable among the many elegant
dresses was a very lovely pale-blue crepe de
chine, showered over with clear-cut beads which
gave one the idea of numberless diamonds cling-
ing to the skirt, the decelette bodice fitted to per-
fection, and was finished off with white silver
flowers and leaves; a white satin draped in a very
graceful way, a crushed strawberry satin and net,
a brown satin veiled and draped with golden
brown net, and a pale-green silk profusely
trimmed with handsome white lace, were all ad-
mired.

A SYDNEY WAIF.
Deep brown and sunken eyes, that showed a gleam
Of wit, or even genius, in his face!
Despite the crusting grime of many davs,
Some line that spoke of beauty you might trace.
His c’othes consisted most of rags and holes,
His hat was crownless, and bereft of brim;
His whole appearance was a catalogue
Of trial, trouble, and starvation grim I
Poor little chap I He had no lot or share
In anything which makes it joy to live;
He wao an exile from the world, and it
Gave nothing to him, and could nothing give.
He had not heard of science, and knew nought
Of those great powers which in the world pre-
vflil»
Nor had he heard of Summerfleld and Co,
And their enormous Bankrupt Bargain Sale.
He had not heard that Messrs. Summerfleld
Had bought a London bankrupt’s stock so cheap.
That they can sell at prices sure to make
Bach other draper in his envy weep *

The Share List will close on the 20th July, a large number of shares having been already absorbed. Shares will be allotted in
order of application.
Applications for Shares to be addressed to the Sydney Offices of the Company, 32 King-street Arcade.
Cheques and Post Office Orders to be crossed to the Company’s Bankers, THE LONDON CHARTERED BAftlK, Sydney.
Business of the Company.
This Company is formed for the purpose otoonduoting a commercial loan business upon
mercantile principles by making cash advances and guarantees to Merchants, Traders,
and private persons, upon the security of Bills of Lading, Storage and Bond Certificates,
Deeds Shares in Banks and public Companies, Bills of Sale, Government and Municipal
securities, &o.; also discounting Trade Bills and advances upon any adequate security.
The success attending this class of business by all Loan Offices and Companies is well
known, suffice to say that investments in a Company of this kind are a certainty, and the
Company can secure such profits as will ensure good, if not large dividends for its share-
holders, without resorting to the usurious rates charged by private Loan Offices, and in
so doing the Directors anticipate that the Company will be amply compensated by largely
increased business.
It will not be out of place to refer to the prosperity attained by other Companies of a
kindred character—viz., the Mercantile Finance, Guarantee and Agency Ctjmpany,
Limited, upon whose shares only 255. is paid up, is now selling at 325., having paid 10 per
cent last dividend, and carrying considerable sum to reserve; the Trustee, Executor, and
Agency Company, Limited, whose shares are only £l paid up, are now worth 54?. 6d., or
over 150 per cent, (one hundred and fifty per cent.) premium ; and the Union Mortgage and
Agency Company, Limited, of Australia (also £1 paid up), is now worthais. {vide Stock and
Share iteports). All these Companies, in addition to paying good dividends, have also con-
siderable sums in reserve. The success thus pointed out is almost unprecedented, ren-
dering further comment superfluous.
The Company’s advances will only be made by the Directors upon ample and tangible
securities of a commercial character, after proper valuation by the Company’s valuers.
They will not act as Pawnbrokers, as it is desirable that the Company should attain such
tone as to make it a favourite medium with commercial men. The advances will also be
at short call, usually one to four months, or repayable by instalments.
The Company will also receive money on deposit at market rates of interest.
By its incorporation, this Company will be enabled to transact business that the Banks
cannot entertain, being contrary to their Charters, although of a much safer and more
profitable oharaotex 1 , and this Company will make no advances whatever without ample
security and fair profits. In addition to this they will a'so transact ordinary banking
business for such Merchants or Traders who have only limited or no banking accom-
modation.
It will thus be seen that there is ample scope for the Company’s operations, and, in fact
the necessity of a respectable Company for this class of business has long been recognised
in commercial circles.
It is also desirable to point out that Shares in this Company are not a speculation but an
investment through which surplus funds can be profltaoly employed to the best advantage
with ample security, so that large or small sums of money can be depended upon to return
far larger percentages of profits than any bank will pay for deposits. In addition to which
the Company’s stock will no doubt almost immediately be at premium, so that money
invested in snares will not be locked up, but will be available whenever required. J
The Company can also advance money to its members, when required, upon Shares held
by them.
It being desirable that the Company’s proprietary should include all classes in the
community, no more than 3000 shares will be issued to any single person. The Calls are
also made at such a rate as to enable this result to be attained.
A large number of shares having already been applied for, the balance are now offered
to the public, which will be alioted in the order applied for, until the share-list is com-
plete.
The General Meetings of the Company will be held half-yearly, when balance-sheets will
be submitted and the dividends declared.
In placing the balance of shares of this Company on the market, the Directors submit
with every confidence that it is equal to any now before the public as a safe and nrofltahifi
investment, suitable for all classes in the community, 1
Share List Closes on Iho 20th July.
Intending Shareholders will please forward this to the Sydney Offices of the Company, 32 King-street Arcade.

The “LOUIS’*
VELVETEEN,
The strictest examiner may try every test of touch
and sight without discovering that these are other
than the Genoa Velvets which they so closely resem-
ble, while the peculiar arrangements resulting i n the
fast woven pile enable them to stand interminable
and rough wear, which would ruin real velvets at
four times the price. For Costumes and
Trimmings it is unequalled, and in fact
for all purposes in which Silk Velvet
may be used we specially recommend
the “LOUIS” VELVETEEN.

“ Extending to the end ef my toes and to
my hrain t
“ Which made me delirious !
“From agony ! ! ! !
“ It took three men to hold me on my bed

“ The Doctors tried in vain to relieve me,

“ After two months I was given up to

“ When my wife
heard a neighbour tell what Hop Bitters had
done for her , she at once got and gave me
some. The first dose eased my brain and
seamed to go hunting through my system
for the pain.
The second dose eased me so much that I slept
two hours. Something I had not done for two
months. Before I had used five bottles, I was well
and at work as hard as any man oonid, for over
three weeks; but I worked too hard for my
strength, and taken a hard cold, I was taken with
the most acute and painful rheumatism all through
my system that was ever known.
“ I called the doctors again, and. after severa.
weeks they left me a cripple on cratches for llfej
as they said. I met a friend and tohd him my case,
and he said Hop Bitters had cured him and would
cure me. I poohed at him, but he was so earnest
I was Induced to use them again.
In less than four weeks I threw away my crutches
and went to work lightly and kept on using the
bitters for five weehs, until I became as well as
any man living, and have been so lor six years
since.
It has also cured my wife, who had been
sick for years; and has kept her and my
children well and healthy with from two to
three bottles a year. There is no need to be
sick at all if these bitters are used.

Many people complain, and with justice, that
they are the dally victims of an Imposition which
la simply becoming an unbearable nuisance: and
to guard against it necessitates a constant mental
tension, an unceasing vigilance, in the exercise of
whiohllfeisshornof half its pleasures. References
to texts and words of mysterous meaning are now
in everyday use, as channels whereby to impress
on men’s minds the value of some article of mer-
chandise; and the services of artist aud author are
alike utilised to introduce or maintain the pro-
minence of some nostrum which has nothing else
but its advertised merits to recommend it. Facts
and fancies are mixed and dished up In this way
until many people are really almost afraid to read
even the most attractively headed artiole, for fear
of being outraged in this manner at the end of it.
And there are wounds which no patent medicine
or chance prescription will heal, but any pain or
annoyance, any bruise or sore place, can be in-
stantly relieved, In common with almost every
other ailment, by the intelligent use of St. Jacobs
Oil, the best curative and conqueror of pain the
world ever knew.

QpjHE WONDERFUL WATERBURY,
_ THE CORRECT TIME FOR 13s. 6d,
The Principal of the College of Science and Arts*
Glasgow,
PROF. JAMIESON, A.M., INST. C.B., F.R.S.E,
writes:—
“ Five weeks ago I got from you a Waterbury
Watch, and having bsen previously annoyed by
my lever watch stopping and keeping bad time
whenever I went near dynamo machines, I in-
serted the Waterbury Watch between the magnetic
poles of a ten horse-power dynamo. Of course,
the watch instantly stopped, but on being started
again I regulated it only twice within two daysi
and have found that for one whole month it did
not vary two minutes from correct Greenwich
time. I now prefer it to my former and much
more expensive wateh, and consider it an excellent
timekeeper.”
The Watchmaker, Lond., Deo., 188>.—“The
Waterbury has been designed and is guaranteed
to give a maximum of results in timekeeping
at a minimum of cost.”
Manchester Examiner, Dec. 23 —‘‘The Water-
bury is a splendid timekeeper, we have sub-
jected it to tests few watches can endure.”
Manchester Courier, Dee. 22.—“ An experience
of a Waterbury for over two months enables
us to say that they are admirable time-
keepers.”
Manchester City News, Nov. 31.—“ We have
tested, it 1s an excellent timekeeper, is keyless,
and goes 28 hours with once winding up.”
Glasgow Herald, Dee. 9.—“ It is a substantial
piece of workmanship, and a good time-
keeper.”
Glasgow Citizen, Deo. 9.—“Of first-class work-
mans alp, and a good timekeeper.”

OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO
LADIES.
Fireproof Dresses—So much attention has
been directed to deaths from burning, that it may
be well If we indicate in general terms the
methods by which fabrics can be rendered incom-
bustible. 'There are many chemicals employed for
this purpose, the most popular, perhaps, being
tungstate of soda. It is comparatively Inexpen-
sive, and by the outlay of a couple of shillings the
dresses of the whole household may be protected
from fire. To three parts of good dry starch add
oae part of tungstate of soda, and use the starch
in the ordinary way. Should the material not re-
quire starching, dissolve lib. of tungstate of soda
in two gallons of water, well saturate the fabric,
and then let it dry. It will not effect in any way
even the most delicate colour, and ironing does
not interfere with the effloacy of the process.
Muslin so treated may be held In the ilame of a
candle or gas-lamp without catching fire, so that,
although the part in contact with the flame may
be charred, or even destroyed, there is no danger
of its spreading. This recipe may be relied on, in
fact, there is only one in the world that can be
called superior to It. That is to use Snowflake
Kerosene, and so obviate all danger of fire. It is
pure, clean, brilliant, water-white, has no smell,
and is absolutely safe. No fear of explosion or
Ignition. Home comfort and security assured by
its use.
The Wonderful Snowfl ike Kerosene, the safest,
purest ami best oil for all purposes except salad
dressing, can be obtained from any of the follow-
ing wholesale or retail merchant#:— Messrs.

manently blinded the bridegroom by throwing
rice into his eyes. He was led away to an in-

enaole him to realise an income of £3009 a year;
very handsome remuneration for prompt help. If
a lady assists it may leal to a very advantageous
social advancament. Address, ‘Matri’ (8237), 19
Wellington-street, Strand.”
“There will be a merry laugh, and some-
thing of pity too, between the women ani men
(note, not men and women) of the future, perhaps
during their swim or game of cricket together—
when they talk of the kangaroo-footed, waist-
distorted, hobbling monstrosities custom and
fashion are making on the women of the present
day.” That is a slab of Mrs Dugdale’s sentiments-
Mrs. D. is the Melbourne lady who lately gained
notice by her fierce denunciations of that pleasant
trlflv, the kiss.
A London journalist puts in a plea for those
“ ladies ” who crowded tne court to stare at Ade-
laide Bartlett (lately accused of poisoning), as if
she were some fresh-caught monstrosity, instead
ot being merely a sister in distress. He contend®
that they attended from motives of humanity, and
points out that “the presence of other women
would ne a grateful and acceptable face to a
woman prisoner, who would otherwise have been
exposed to the eyes of men alone.” Tnis idea did
not strike us before, but we are deeply impressed
by its truth, and we can fancy the feelings of the
unhappy creature iu the dock with oniy men
around her. Her loneliness in such circumstances
could only bo equalled by that of .the early Chris-
tian, who, after weeks and montes of solitary con-
finement, was sentenced to ba thrown to the
tiger, and looked forward joyfully to the prospect
of that quadruped’s companionship to break the
monotony of life. But he was turned into
the arena, the tiger was not there, and he died ot
the disappointment. Perhaps Adelaide Bartlett
would have died too. If she had been left In that
courthouse without even a tiger to keep her
company.
A Melbourne Divorce-Court decisioa
strikingly shows what may happen in Victoria to
an unproteeced male. Twenty-eight years ago l
Mike O Connor, then aged 23, took to himself a
wife of 15, and lived with her for three months,
at the end of winch time he discovered she had
faults. The principal ground of complaint was
that her temper was worse than that of a cock-
alligator, and the remarks which she made to her
husband when any household difficulties arose,
were composed mainly of flying furniture, so that
Michael constantly found himself called upon to
camp out on the shortest notice. Three month®
of married life were followed by six of separation,
and then the unhappy O’Connor made a second
attempt at domestic happiness. What happened
on this occasion is not accurately stated, but
apparently his home was stirred by a perpetual
struggle between the Powers of Evil and what
the poetic native of Asia terms the Spirit of
Connubial Joy, with the invariable result that the
spirit would emerge from the side-door with his
mouth in his hand and three broken legs. Finally,
in 1860, the peaceful home of O'Connor burst up
for good, and six years later the grass-widow
took a fiendish revenge on a man named
Walters by marrying him. Since then O'Con-
>nor seems to have waited in the hope
that a runaway bullock or a falling chimney
might set him free, but for 20 years the lady with
the two husbands has dodged all kinds of disaster,
tind whenever avenging Fate threw a dart at her
■she hoboed down audit struck some one standing
bemud lutteal. -vt l*si J4ieh»el U Connor took:

The Twelfth of July.
In consequence of William of Orange having once
ridden a horse considerably out of drawing, and
pointed with wbat looks to the uninitiated like a
poker in a south-easterly direction, a large body of
well-dressed men and women assembled at the
Japanese Village (Sydney Exhibition Building) on
Sunday afternoon last to do him reverence and
ILten to good healthy reminiscences of men burnt
at the stake, and women slowly drowned. Ther c
was a strong programme, and several well-known
fulminators were advertised, so that the pay-
ing public might be assured of hearing some-
thing specially hot in the way of “loud-
lunged anti-dabylonianlsms ” and warnings
against the damnable errors of Rome, and the de
testable doctrines of Catholicism. Several promi-
nent bigots adorned the platform with 'he oeatl-
tude of their approving mugs, and the transparen-
cies of the Queen and the Princess of Wales,
which did duty long ago at the Town Hall gorge,
were put on view as an additional attraction. But
it was a gloomy affair, after all, and we saw whole
hosts of good Protestants pass between the two
outstretched collection plates at the door with an
expression of mingled derision and pity. There
was an almost pathetic straining for effect ail
through. Every hymn was given out by a sepa-
rate clergyman—no one performed twice—and
thus the;numerical strength of those who still
openly lend themselves to the L O L was demon-
strated. Possibly, for the same reason that, long
ago, in a beleaguered town when the bread ran
low, the besieged threw their last loaves over the
wall, to show that they yet “felt good.’’ A more
sorry sight ;than the lot of it no eye has looked
upon, and more saltless and pitiably inane
balderdash than the ad dress ss no oar has yet
listened to—unless the wearer of it was
in the House wher Neild, L O L., was doing
a nine hours’ canter at saving his country. Sin-
gularly enough, of all those who took a fall out of
Rome on this occasion, Mr. Soper was the least
soporific. Mr. Soper has mistaken his vocation.
He is really a great humourist, at present dis-
guised as a Baptist parson, and would be received
with open arms as chaplain for the staff of this
journal. He showed this quality notably when he
told the congregation that he knew a lot of them
would like him to cut his address short
because they couldn’t hear it from where
they sat. He also convulsed the Intelligent por-
tion of his audience—that is, two people laughed
—by saying that he wouldn’t trust any priest or
Pope or bishop of Rome with his old umbrella let
alone his soul, and alluded to the said priests,
bishops, or Popes as these “ fellows”—a graceful
pleasantry much appreciated by a swivel eyed
man, afflicted with warts. In the front row.; There
was really nothing else of vital consequence said,
and the general public sallied forth witn the fixed
co viction that all the infernal machinations of
Rome will be unavailing to stem the tide of
triumphant Urangelsm.
Sprightly work, this. The Chicago record,
“15 minutes for divorce,” has never been broken,
and now a Chicago coroner has made the cham-
pion record for work in his particular line. A
Chicago man died on an express train 65 miles from
home. The conductor telegraphed ahead for the
coroner, who met the train 15 miles from the city,
impanelled the jury from among the passengers,
and obtained a verdict in accordance with the
facts, all at the rate of 40 miles an hour. After
this, he made out a death-certificate and a burial-
permit, and stuck them in the dead man’s hat,
kissed away the widow’s tears, courted her, entered
into a solemn engagement to marry her next day,
and then swung himself off the train at the out-
skirts of the city, to hold an inquest on the body
of a plate-layer the train had just run over. Now,
we’d like to see our coroner come up to that.
Especially in the part where the widow-hugging
episode came in.
Swan wick, a Cairns (N.Q) lawyer, has
lately been studying the manners and customs of
the smiling alligator. The gentleman—wh mean
the lawyer—after a botanising expedition, found
himself beiated in a dense mangrove swamp with
the tide rapidly rising. He had to take refuge for
some hours in a tree, while six-and-eightpenny
saurlans came along every now and then to seek
legal advice. Some giant alligators lathed their
tails against the tree, and tried to bring it and the
lawyer down together; and accompanying these
monsters would com* baby crocodiles, with their
half-grown brothers and sister*, who all opened
their j*ws and yearningly appealed to Swanwiok
for a nlnd-quarter of lawyer. At last the "land-
shark ” saw tne tide descend, and when the alliga-
tors, who evidently knew nothing of stonewalling
—never having been in the N B.W. Parliament—
“ cleared,” Swanwiok mournfully went home.
Mr. A. P. Oanaway, a rising light of the
N.S.W. Bar, has published a pamphlet on “ Our
Fathers and Imperial Rights.” We are not abso-
lutely charmed with the production, for Mr.
Oanaway’s method of drawing utterly irrational
and absurd conclusions from wholly imaginary
facts does not seem to be in accordance with the
practice of standard writers. But what we do ad-
mire are the resources of the author’s vocabulary,
and the wide range of meaning which he proves
various words to possess. Thus, for Instance,
wo find that a nation Is capable of "demean-
ing" itself as “a race called to the mas-
tery;" but a subsequent fusion did not become
‘ absolutely total," and when “ the predispos-
ing conditions were uncounteracted , separation
became easy.” British territory, we are glad to
find, subserves “ a noblest use," from which it is
apparent that there are several "noblest uses ”
The Act of Settlement, he says, royalised the
House of Brunswick; but long before that “nobles
privately forayed and maraudered on one another s
lands;” but these nobles and others, before the
British people ha i gained “ their present soaring
posture,” were " shined on by the old flag." This
last is a noble expreislon— * glowered at by a dish-
clout” is about the nearest Imitation we could
make on a short notice—but it opens up a bright
vista of forcible figures for future use. “ Frowned
on by a ragged tie,” “ illumined by cuffs just
returned from the Chinese laundry,” "lighted
by the glare of his soleless boot,” and similar
expressions may now be confidently looked for
since Mr. Canaway’s genius has led the way to
their adoption. Further, we read that men were
“ plucked together by their very heart-strings,” a
phrase which would seem to refer to the fate of
unfortunate candidates at University exams.
These and many other novelties of composition
make Mr. Canaway’s book almost interesting at
times; and, as such seeming irregularities emanate
from one who proclaims himself on the title-page
of his pamphlet, a “ B.A. Oxon. and Barrlster-at-
Law,” we are forced to believe that they are not
only allowable but even admirable, because cor-
rect. Some allowance must be made for this
author, as his subject is a very difficult one to
handle from the side which he selects. He has a
Dad client, and cannot be expected to make a good
lf we are correctly informed, Mr. Canaway’s
first client under the Criminal Law was an old
clack gin at Urana, who was accused of setting fire
to a bundle of decayed sheepskins, but acquitted
on the plea of insanity. Ana now his first client
