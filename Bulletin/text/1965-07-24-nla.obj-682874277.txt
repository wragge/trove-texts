National Notebook
The Moral Virus
/~\f all the tributes to the late Adjai
Stevenson we thought the most
appropriate would be two comments on
him made while he was still alive by the
American political journalist, Theodore
H. White, who in “The Making of the
President, 1960”, wrote:
“Stevenson’s attitude to public affairs
approaches a nobility rarely encountered
in the political system of any country;
but his attitude to politics—the grubby,
rooty politics of noise and deals and
cruelties and chicaneries is one of
contempt. Yet public affairs and politics
are linked as are love and sex. Steven-
son’s attitude to politics has always
seemed that of a man who believes love
is the most ennobling of human emotions
while the mechanics of sex are dirty and
squalid . . .
“Stevenson as an agent of American
politics had left behind him such an
infection as no other defeated aspirant
for the Presidency ever left. He had
left behind the virus of morality in the
bloodstream of both parties; there was
a permanent monument to him in the
behavior and attitudes of the victorious
candidate, President Kennedy; and also
of his antagonists, the Republicans.”
Locking in on Mariner
'P'he senior scientist at Tidbinbilla
Deep Space Tracking Station, Bob
Hooker, began by telling us, “No matter
how good you are you’ve got to have a
little bit of luck to pull one of these
things off.” “One of these things” was the
historic Mars flypast of Mariner 4 and
for the scientists and technicians at Tid-
binbilla the luck ran out soon after
noon.
When the 570 lb. Mariner 4 swung
behind Mars after taking the first close-
llP photographs of the planet, Tidbinbilla
flashed data back to the huge computer
at the jet propulsion laboratories in Pasa-
dena, California, so they could plot the
course of Mariner 4 before it re-emerged
to give Tidbinbilla information that
would allow the station to “lock on” im-
mediately Mariner re-appeared. Pasa-
dena gave five different “predicts” before
Mariner re-appeared the last and
correct one five seconds before the space-
craft was scheduled to show again.
Operator of the No. 1 receiver at Tid-
binbilla, former Brisbane Police cadet
Bruce Window, 27, of Canberra, worked
as never before to “lock on” in those
vital five seconds, a procedure that
normally took him two minutes. He
made it.
But, for Tidbinbilla, Lady Luck was
still missing, and the station was in
trouble again 20 seconds later when Mr
Window, making a quick assessment on
his experience alone, declared he was
locked on to a “side band” and did not
have a direct lock. Another two seconds
were lost when the station cut the con-
tact to make a proper lock. For Mr
R. A. Leslie, station director for the
Department of Supply, the pattern of
misfortune was almost too much.
Resignedly he told watching journalists,
“If nothing else, it shows that in this
game the rule is there is no rule.”
Professor Wonderful
Tf you are near death for five days,
A and then lie in utter stillness for 27
days and stay in bed all told for 71
days how do you spend your time?
If you are Professor Julius Sumner
Miller (“I’m a physicist possessed of an
abundance of humanism”) you contem-
plate and reach the following conclusion:
“Life is made up of a massive array
of miscellanea and a massive array of
small things and only a few can stand
out as having real importance and
significance. My view of religion is to
lie out in my backyard on a redwood
lounge, on a mattress, and enjoy the
sky and the clouds and the flowers and
the like. In this sense then I figure I’m
closest to Nature and to God ... To
get ready for death? I don’t know how
a man would do it. It is said that if you
have the right religious persuasion you
can make your peace with God and get
ready to die. But I thought about it
"That's show biz!”
more circumspectly. I thought if death
is the End then I have nothing more
to contemplate. I have lived my life and
it is over. On the other hand, if it is the
Beginning—as some want to say—then
I made quite a wealth of plans.” For
instance?
He named to himself and out loud to
his wife, Alice, some 700 persons with
whom he wanted to have “dialogue”.
These included Homer, to whom the
Professor said he would recite the Iliad;
Plato, with whom he would discuss the
best form of government; Socrates,
Aristotle, Alexander the Great, Galileo,
Copernicus, Disraeli and others.
Those gentlemen will have to wait.
Just now Professor Miller is back in
Sydney after his near-fatal heart attack
earlier this year in California. When he
interviewed us for The Bulletin last
week he was working in the School of
Physics at the University of Sydney on
a science programme for television, a
medium through which he has become
widely known first to Mickey Mouse
Club viewers as Professor Wonderful—-
(“Now why did Walt Disney name me
that? Because everything I look at I say
is wonderful.”) —and more recently to
viewers of his Summer School and “Why
Is It So?” series.
These days a little more philosophical
(if that were possible) he ruminates:
“Most of the things that we do could
quite well remain undone. Now when
I engage in anything, my first question
is, what virtue does it have and how
important is it that I do it. If it’s going
to tax my strength and my energy, if
it’s going to vex me and irritate me and
frustrate me and put me in despair, then
I will abandon it. It is my temper to
want things done immediately. There
are some people like me in the world.
We think everybody is behind us and
we have to work so hard to pull them
up to us. I’m now willing to wait a
little longer. But not much longer.”
Death of a Producer
At 15, and still in short pants, Michael
Plant presented himself at the office
of a Sydney radio producer, insisting that
he wanted to be a scriptwriter. He was
given a script outline to work on and
returned the next morning with a story
which is still remembered as “brilliant”.
When he died last week at 34, after
presiding as executive producer over 28
Mavis Bramston Shows, he had left as
big an impression on Australian viewing
habits as any one man in the industry’s
brief history. Whatever the show’s short-
comings and lapses, whatever its appeal

or failure, in a way all were his. It was
a programme for which he produced and
directed, for which he wrote and edited
and for which he lived. Born in Sydney,
he had worked in television in Brita : n
and the US. In Australia, his death left
him with his own epitaph. Although the
show goes on no other local writer
or producer of the same calibre could
even be suggested as a possible replace-
ment.
One of the show’s trio, Gordon Chater,
recalled that when the Mavis idea was
first discussed he had told station execu-
tives that they had to find a man “who
had wit, an unbiased and searching
mind, a creative pen, and an interest
in life which ranged over everything
from sport to religion, from theatre to
politics”.
According to Mr Chater, his former
producer had all these qualities in abun-
dance. “He also had a remarkable power
of decision-making, something which he
may have inherited from his father, a
former general. He had tact and
diplomacy. And he worked harder than
anyone I knew. Every item owed some-
thing to him.” In his addiction to the
show, which amounted to an obsession.
Plant worked at a furious pace and for
as long as 100 hours a week. In the
month before his death he underwent two
serious operations. After one he was
sitting up in bed the next morning read-
ing scripts.
Krantler on Bass
octet is an ungainly group of
musicians at any time, but when it
includes a doublebass player it becomes
downright difficult. The "Vienna Octet,
who have just finished their Australian
tour, are seasoned travellers of 20 years’
experience, and consequently, they
decided to save themselves the bothers
of bass transportation by leaving the
instrument at home, as they usually do.
But the inferior quality of Spanish
basses must be notorious throughout
Europe, for when the octet toured Spain
it elected to send its bass ahead by
freight. Unfortunately, the travel arrange-
ments for bass and bassist failed to
synchronise as intended, and the instru-
ment trailed the group by a day from
c 'ty to city. In despair, Burkhard
Lrautler (the instrument’s unhappy
master) promised that, if he was ever
re-united with his bass, he would light
three candles of thanksgiving in the near-
est church, and then buy a bottle of the
finest Spanish claret for each member
°f the octet. At last the bass arrived
and the candles were dutifully lit, but
Alfred Boskofsky, who told the storv,
sadly added that his and six other thirsts
ars yet to be quenched.
Sir Tyrone's Evangelism
CTr Tyrone Guthrie’s Irish blood and
his upbringing as an English country
gentleman were straining against each
othfer when he was in Perth last week.
Things started at the airport when he
snapped that reporters were asking
stupid questions and were not helped
when the only printed version of his
arrival noted that he was wearing an old
crumpled raincoat, blue and white sand-
shoes, and a green sweatshirt.
He spent the next two days in bed
with ’flu, rose to have a radio slap
at the prospect of Perth becoming “a
boring, materialistic, quicksand of sun-
drenched, steak-fed vacuity . . .” and
then got down to business. Business was
his assignment to advise the University
of WA on the design of a theatre.
Pardon, we mustn’t call it a theatre; the
Universities’ Grants Commission has
made available £124,000 for a lecture
theatre to hold about 500, that can be
used for lectures, music ... or even
drama. The university campus already
has Somerville Auditorium, Winthrop
Hall, the tiny Dolphin Theatre, the new
Fortune, and outdoor sunken gardens.
But acting Vice-Chancellor Professor
C. J. B. Clews is perfectly right when
he points out that no suitable theatre or
lecture hall holds more than 250; hence
the present project. Little more is known
for the present.
Having called in Sir Tyrone, the
university is being tight-lipped until
they’ve heard what he thinks and have
discussed it. This will be done when 50
sheets of transcript from meetings in
Perth are shipped to Minneapolis where,
in Sir Tyrone’s words, he is “a mission-
ary to the theatre”. Then he will read
all the views and report back. Work is
expected to start next year.

THE CAT, THE TRIANGLE AND THE HANGMAN
80 Years Ago: July 25, 1885
A study of the lately consolidated
criminal code leaves no escape
from the conclusion that, in order to
persuade colonists to lead decent lives,
the chief reliance is placed on the
gallows and the lash. Crimes which
would be met with a few years’ im-
prisonment in England, America, or
the so-called despotic countries of
Europe, with us spell death. Offences
which in the countries named would
result in a few days’ imprisonment,
or a few shillings fine, are met among
us by a method much more heroic—
the triangles, the cat-o’-nine-tails, and
the hangman. In every little hamlet
scattered throughout the immense
area of New South Wales will be
found a whipping-post, a stout stick,
and a sturdy official prepared to
dexterously fillip the skin off men’s
shoulders for expressing in coarse
language doubts about the Trinity to
a crowd of bullock-drivers outside a
bush shanty. There is hardly a British
colony in Australasia in which a tipsy
man who forgets himself is safe from
the “cat”, or in which the evidence
of two lewd women will not send him
stripped to the triangles.
Take an example. A bushman came
down the country to Melbourne
some years ago. By the time his
cheque was ended, delirium tremens
had begun. Wandering into the Fitz-
roy Gardens, he divested himself of
some clothing, rolled it into a pillow,
and went to sleep under a tree. Being
a stranger, the sentence was light
three months’ imprisonment, seasoned
with three whippings of 25 lashes
each. “The Argus”, “The Sydney
Morning Herald”, and journals of
their class would call it a “sharp
lesson”. Our name for it would be
“Kalmuck brutality”,
Indeed, from the present penal code
of New South Wales to the adoption
of torture in judicial investigations
there is but a short step. Having
studied that code, the idea suggests
itself that a law giving the Bench
power to order an unwilling witness
to be beaten till his evidence was
acceptable, would not be displeasing
to some of our Judges. Since we have
torture at all. it is hard to see why we
should not have it in its entirety.

"WHAT DO THEY WANT BAR REFORM FOR—WE MAKE ENOUGH MONEY NOW, DON'T WE?"


Never in Court
PLAIN ENGLISH
nPHE least that can be said in welcom-
ing the decision by the NSW Gov-
ernment to set up a permanent Law Re-
form Commission is that it is both ne-
cessary and long overdue. This is not
only because many statutes obviously
need revision, but because the legal
profession itself like the medical
and academic professions urgently
needs internal reform. The recom-
mendations, for example, of the Coun-
cil of the Law Society in Britain apply
just as strongly to the Bar in Australia.
No reasonable defence can be made of
the two-counsel rule which requires a
Q.C. always to appear with a junior,
at the expense of the client; or of the
“two-thirds” rule whereby the junior
barrister appearing with a silk auto-
matically receives two-thirds of his
leader’s fee, no matter how little work
he may have done; or of the rule that
a barrister cannot be sued for negli-
gence; or of the rule that once a brief
has been delivered a barrister is entitled
to his full fee, even if the matter is
settled before he opens the brief.
Equally needed are reforms of some
solicitors’ practices, especially the ex-
ploitation of young barristers by not
paying their fees.
But, although the new Reform Com-
mission will have no shortage of work,
two provisos must be made. One is
that, in‘what amounts to an insult to
the Bar, no practising member of the
Bar is to be on the Commission,
although there will be a solicitor and a
judge, and many of the reforms needed
require co-operation from the Bar.
Secondly, the current proposal to abo-
lish civil juries in motor-accident cases
raises a doubt whether the new reform-
ers are always looking in the right
direction. Everyone agrees that the
Bar needs reform, but the case is still
not proven that judges will be less
costly, less time-consuming, less ca-
pricious than juries. In any case, con-
centration on the defects of the jury
system may direct attention away from
a more serious mischief the alarm-
ing practice of some barristers and
solicitors of avoiding, rather than ex-
ploiting, juries and pushing case after
case to swift out-of-court settlements
which are profitable to lawyers but
show slight regard for the rights of
the client who may have done better,
if more slowly, at the hands of a jury.
This sort of thing may yet reach the
level of a scandal and require a Royal
Commission, but the substitution of
judges for juries would only intensify
the practice of quick out-of-court set-
tlements since the lawyers involved
may be willing, if necessary, to deal
with a jury but would want to avoid
dealing with a judge at any price.
Mr Snedden ’s Secrecy
Attorney-General, Mr B. M.
Snedden, in his talk last week to
the Institute of Business Administra-
tion in Melbourne, again referred to
The Bulletin’s charges that the pro-
cedures laid down in his Trade Prac-
tices Bill involve too much secrecy.
But again he failed to answer them.
As on previous occasions, he sought
to justify the secrecy of registrations
on the grounds that public disclosure
of agreements listed in the legislation
would be prejudicial to the interested
parties, unless the Commissioner
deemed them to qualify for examina-
tion by the Tribunal. Nobody has
denied there is something to be said
for this view —if one assumes that
registration is necessary at all. What
Mr Snedden has consistently failed to
see is that registration is not necessary.
The Bulletin has, as proof of this,
instanced both Canada and New
Zealand, which have a complaint
system without registration and which
abolished registration in 1961.
In his Melbourne address, the Attor-
ney-General again failed to regard a
complaint system as an alternative to
registration and considered the only
alternative to be investigation. This he
has quite rightly turned his back on.
Nobody wants to see a team of
trade practice investigators prying into
business affairs, not only because they
would, as he said, have “a great degree
of power”, but also because their pres-
ence would be insidious.
But this is not the only alternative.
Mr Snedden has admitted as a re-
sult of The Bulletin’s pressure
that the public will be at liberty to
make allegations to the Authority about
practices they consider to be against
the public interest, and although the
Bill in its present form contains no
provision for this, it will, presumably,
be amended to specify the avenues of
public approach. When this is done,
all that would then be needed is a
more detailed listing in the Bill of the
types of trade practices and agreements
which the legislation purports to cover.
These two measures should be suf-
ficient to provide all the fact-finding
procedures necessary for all practical
purposes.
Teach-Ins
VlThy are those academics who support
" the Australian commitment to
the defence of South Vietnam so silent
in the face of the academic critics of
that commitment? Notable exceptions
there are—such as Mr Geoffrey Fair-
bairn and Mr Owen Harries but
they remain exceptions and the initia-
tive still rests with those who advocate
appeasement of the Communists.
When, for example, a statement was
circularised in the universities attack-
ing Australian policy, it was signed by
280 academics and no expression what-
soever of the opposing view was or-
ganised. Again, the “Teach-Ins” now
being planned in most universities are
being organised as they were in
America—by the familiar Leftist, pro-
Communist and “Peace” front names,
and although, as in America, only one
or two academics of any distinction
are involved as critics of our commit-
ment to Vietnam and the rest are from
disciplines where no understanding of
politics is involved, the fact remains
that these appeasers have succeeded in
giving the public the impression that
they are the authentic voice of the
universities as a whole. This is certainly
the impression already gained by the
Asian Press.
Yet this is a false impression and
most academics, in fact, support the
Australian policy. But they remain
silent. If the professoriats are too busy
with their academic work to worry
about politics, why do not the Vice-
Chancellors, the official custodians of
their universities’ good names, speak
up? When some Anglican bishops issu-
ed their naive letter on Vietnam, for
example, the Primate of Australia
quickly made it clear that they did not
speak for the Anglican Church as a
whole. Why do not Sir Stephen Roberts
and Sir George Paton, and the rest, do
likewise for their universities? Other-
wise, not only does the universities’
good name suffer but a damaging im-
pression is given abroad of Australian
public opinion.


THIS AUSTRALIA
VIETNAM
The Expert Jungle Touch
With the Australians
THE TRAGIC TOUCH.
Outside the iungle command post a
colorful bloom is stuck in a handsome
vase unearthed from a Vietcong hide-
out; snipers’ bullets whistle through the
branches overhead.
Two giant Australian sergeants are
discussing the antics of some tree squir-
rels before making a slow, grim ad-
vance into the Vietcong ambush country.
There is a lot of swearing and rigorous
professionalism aspects of last week's
Australian sortie, a four-day affair and
the first aggressive operation by the
battalion that arrived here a few weeks
ago.
The Australian companies airlifted
into the jungle joined two American
paratroop battalions in a sweep of part
of Zone D, just north of the great air
base of Bien Hoa, which is notorious as
a Vietcong stronghold.
The operation began with one of
those massive helicopter airlifts. A
hundred whirling machines packed in
two rows, one behind the other, jerk-
ing up and forward with the speed of
an express lift, gunners at the open
doors, five soldiers clinging on in be-
tween, watching apprehensively the
trees rushing past below. The helicop-
ter “gunships” are armed with rockets
and heavy machine-guns.
At the landing zone a strip of
paddy 200 yards wide the tall Aus-
tralians stooped under the propeller
blades and raced angle-deep in mud to
the trees. The helicopters were on the
ground less than 10 seconds. Within an
hour the troops had found their farthest
positions and had dug in.
The battalion has a high percentage
of officers, NCOs and men with com-
bat experience in Korea. Malaya and
Borneo. They have been taught to live
in the jungle for 10 days with a mini-
mum of supplies. They feel they are
experts and don't mind saying so. Jun-
gle operations with inexperienced troops
are nerve-wracking. The Australians ob-
viously know their business. They are
tough,. friendly and unflappable. They
don’t feel they are knights in shining
armor fighting for democracy, but they
think there’s a worthwhile job to be

in South Vietnam
done, because they believe Australia
may have similar problems later.
They don't expect the war here to
be won easily, if at all, but they bitter-
ly resent the Australian journalists who
have written that they don’t know why
they’re here.
They rationalise their presence by
saying it’s partly for ideological rea-
sons, partly because they're profession-
als and need experience, and partly,
as one young emigrant from Woking
told me from his slit trench: “After a
month here, we should get a Govern-
ment loan of £3OOO to buy a house.”
They have no illusions about the ease
of guerrilla warfare.
Their commanding officer. Colonel
“Lou” Brumfield, is a stocky, balding
man of only 37, he’s soft-voiced, has
a mischievous grin. Like his men —un-
like the Americans, who wear helmets
on operations—he plants his soft khaki
“nursemaid’s” hat square on his head
and lets it flop over his ears. He be-
lieves there is too much reliance here
on machinery and “gimmicks.” He
would like to rely more on trained men.
He angrily protested against the atten-
tions of American “flareship” aircraft
that continually illuminated our posi-
tions at night. His No. 2, Major Essex
Clark, is a genial giant formerly in the
Rhodesian Federal Army.
He has a platoon commander who
parachuted at Suez, and a leathery
RSM who won the MM when 19,
prowls through the bush like a game-
keeper after poachers and addresses
malingerers as “You grub”.
The operation did not lead to a major
confrontation between the Vietcong and
the Australians the brunt was borne
by the Americans, to the Australians’
disgust. But it was their first.
They went about it in dead earnest..
Col Brumfield’s patrols found Vietcong
tunnels, hidden villages and anti-air-
craft gunpits, and blew them up. When
his men killed a sniper, he told me, he
wanted to see the body as confirma-


tion. “It is too messy, Sir,” the patrol
leader answered. They brought in the
right index finger instead.
The Australian fieldcraft is impec-
cable. The Americans have been criti-
cised for patrolling bunched up, with-
out flank protection, neglecting all-
round defence and lighting bonfires at
night. I walked with Australians edging
expertly down jungle tracks and wading
across exposed paddy. At every halt
they dig enormous trenches with amaz-
ing speed.
Lying out at night with howitzer
shells whining overhead to fall less than
100 yards away, they grumbled at the
appalling din, then fell soundly asleep
despite it. US jet strikes —diving sliv-
ers of light, strange metallic groans of
exploding napalm, impressed them.
They were shocked by an American
Army observer who refused to catch
rainwater in his mug, saying: “Can’t
drink that without sterilisation.”
After the first night out they were
extremely hospitable to this Pommie
journalist interloper—despite their sur-
ly reputation. They found a large cave
under one temporary position and
warned each other not to dig too deep
because “Those effing Vietcong are
probably underneath us.” A jungle liz-
ard whose call is a low, spasmodic re-
iteration of a common four-letter word
delighted them. An American patrol
nearby was hotly criticised as being
too lackadaisical, but they generously
added: “Perhaps they’re tired.”
They returned to base cheerfully
regretting they hadn’t killed more of
the enemy. What they want now is to
be allowed to go out alone, live in the
jungle for a month and seek out the
Vietcong in their own way. But that’s
not the way things are done here by
the Americans, who distrust the jungle
and rely heavily on their aircraft.
The Australians probably won’t get
permission. The trouble is they have
only one battalion. The small Aus-
tralian Army cannot afford to risk too
many casualties. If they had a division
they would be better off. Vietnam could
do with them.
TEACHERS
Mistaking the Mood
Sub-professional limbo
Politically, teachers have been looked
upon as easy meat, as Barry Jones told
the Victorian Secondary Teachers’ pro-
test meeting. He said until now the State
administration had only to breathe the
word “professionalism” for teachers to
roll over on their backs and purr.
A succession of State Cabinets have
obviously held this view and the sudden
upsurge of teacher militancy over the
past couple of weeks caught the present
one rubbing its eyes. Formerly teachers
could be relied on to grumble quietly
about wages and conditions and then
get on with the job.
The Premier, Mr Bolte, perhaps with
some cause, mistook the mood of the
secondary teachers and added strength
to their emerging militancy by suggest-
H. BOITE
ing that his Government would be
forced to take action against teachers
who tried direct methods to improve
their lot. He was also mistaken in believ-
ing that “the only crisis in education
today is in the minds of a minority
of teachers, principally secondary, who
are concerned with their own salaries’’.
The present dispute began with wide-
spread hostility to the Teachers’ Tri-
bunal Salary Award, but from the time
the Victorian Secondary Teachers
Association referred to the award as an
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
“insult’’ it was evident that they were
concerned with more than money. The
real issue is that for the first time in
Australia a representative body of
teachers is determined to raise itself from
the sub-professional limbo in which it
has been held captive for generations.
The VSTA has used the opportunity
raised by the pay dispute to focus atten-
tion on the inadequacy of the Teachers’
Tribunal, the serious shortage of trained
staff in secondary, schools, the lack of
professional independence of depart-
mental teachers, and the erosion of staff
morale in many schools.
The VSTA has been both delighted
and surprised with the support it has
so far received membership has
increased by nearly 10 per cent in the
last couple of weeks. Government
attempts to divert attention away from
these deficiencies to the unprofessional
conduct of striking teachers have so far
failed. More basic general questions
about the whole status of teaching as
a profession- were raised by a group of
high school teachers from the eastern
suburbs last week:
• Which other profession lacks a body
of its own constitution for deciding
standards of practice, qualifications,
and the ethics of behavior?
• Which of the other professions holds
that its primary responsibility is to
the employing institution rather than
to those it serves?
• Which other profession allows its
training institutions to remain in the
hands of the employing body?
• Which other profession would toler-
ate the methods of recruitment
adopted by the Education Depart-
ments?
If it can win the battle over the
Tribunal, the VSTA is bound to con-
centrate on these basic issues of profes-
sional status and to use its newly
discovered weapons of direct action to
solve them. In this latter fight the
opponent will be not so much the State
Treasury as the large and well fortified
bureaucracy which runs the Education
Department. It has a strong interest in
keeping teachers in the position of low-
grade public servants, meek, dutiful and
melancholic.
The feeling is growing in Victoria that
this bureaucracy may soon topple and
smother its foundations, educational con-
servatism and administrative constriction.
In Victoria, 1965 may go down in history
as the year of the teachers' revolt.
MALAYSIA
Josey’s
Expulsion
A sacrificial victim
Paul Johnson, editor of “The New
Statesman”, writes in the last issue on
Alex Josey’s expulsion from Malaysia
because of Josey’s articles in “The
Bulletin”:
‘T went to see the Prime Minister of
Malaysia in an attempt to persuade him
to rescind the expulsion order on Alex
Josey, our Singapore correspondent. I
found the Tunku sick (he has a bout of
shingles) and obviously uneasy about the
whole affair. It didn’t take much cross-
questioning to show that the reasons he
publicly gave for expelling Josey were
not the real ones, and that in fact Josey
is being made a sacrificial victim to
appease the fanatical anti-Chinese ele-
ment in the Tunku's party.
“This is a bad omen. If the Tunku
doesn’t feel strong enough to resist them
on this issue, where will he draw the
line? How long will he be able to reject

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including -Gold, and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and "Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

the calamitous clamor to arrest Lee Kuan

multi-racialism in Malaysia, and perhaps
provoke civil war.
“This, naturally, raises the whole issue
of Britain’s presence in Malaysia. It’s one
thing to spend £4OO million a year de-
fending Malaysian democracy against
Indonesian aggression, quite another to
underwrite, at such cost, a State which
turns its back on basic constitutional
rights and lurches towards racism. Things
have not got to this pass. But the trend
is ominous.”
PRESS
Public
Relations
Spiking Rose
Although it is two months since the
Commonwealth Government refused to
allow Mr R. Rose, vice-president of the
Newcastle branch of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, to attend a soli-
darity conference in Hanoi, some of the
intrigue surrounding the decision has
only recently emerged.
It is now plain that the Communist
.Party set out to spike the trip when it
-was unable to arrange a more politically
suitable representative.
From the time of the arrival of the
Hanoi invitation the Communist Party
planned to send one of its own members.
Mr E. Roach, assistant Federal secretary
of the WWF, was the one selected by
the party’s central committee and it
seemed only a formality that he would
be endorsed by the WWF. But Rose, a
genuine ALP man and a respected
member of the WWF Federal Council,
decided to nominate and he received the
active support of the Federal secretary,
Mr C. H. Fitzgibbon. Rose won the trip
unanimously after Roach found he was
two votes short of a majority. Had
Roach been successful he would have
joined a delegation of five other Aus-
tralian trade union officials who left
for Hanoi unheralded and apparently
without the knowledge of the Common-
wealth Government.
In Rose’s case, however, an article
appeared in the Sydney Communist
weekly “Tribune” announcing his in-
tended departure with details of the
Hanoi conference. Strangely, “Tribune”
had not been so publicity conscious with
Mr J. (Dutchy) Young, Sydney branch
president of the WWF, who was able
to leave for Hanoi and return without
rating a line in the weekly.
Ironically, the Rose issue will be used
by some Communist-dominated unions
as the basis for an attack on the Federal
Government over Vietnam at the Sep-
tember ACTU Congress.


ALP
On the Grapevine
Proclaiming secrets
An eight-page document circulated in
Labor circles last week extended the
already long odds against the endorse-
ment by the ALP’s Federal Conference
in Sydney next month of the Federal
secretary, Mr Cyril Wyndham’s, blue-
print for the radical structural reform of
the party.
The document carries the findings of
the ALP’s National Organising and
Planning Committee on Mr Wyndham’s
proposals findings which, if followed,
would effectively castrate the body of
By BRIAN JOHNS
the Federal secretary's report. Although
the document does not find it necessary
to make it clear, the Planning Com-
mittee, made up of State ALP branch
secretaries and the Federal secretary, has
no real -party standing; but the circula-
tion of the document is an obvious tactic
by Mr Wyndham’s opponents to impair
his influence.
The ruling Victorian ALP junta is
singling out Mr Wyndham for attack
G. WHITLAM
for two reasons of strategy: because he
opposed the Victorian Executive’s
disastrous proposal to legalise ALP
members joining forces with Com-
munists in union elections; and because
he is regarded by the so-called Left as a
committed supporter of the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough
Whitlam.
The document now in circulation
shows that the State secretaries at their
meeting in Canberra in May struck at
the main elements''in Mr Wyndham’s
reforms. In his report Mr Wyndham
said that Labor’s supreme policy body,
the Federal Conference, should be broad-
ened because its present composition of
36 “is too small and restrictive to allow
for all the sections to be adequately
represented”. But the Planning Commit-
tee did not accept his proposal that
Labor's “shadow cabinet” should be given
ex officio status; nor that State Parlia-
mentary leaders should attend with full
voting rights; nor that the president and
secretary of the Women’s Committee
should be full conference delegates.
On the publicly controversial issue
of the rights of the Parliamentary
leaders at conference and the Party
Leader and Deputy Leader at Federal
Executive, the Organising Committee was
obtuse. In answer to Mr Wyndham's
recommendation for conference member-
ship for the four Parliamentary leaders
the committee astonishingly declared
that “the right exists now”* when in fact
the most the leaders can do is attend
and speak, but not vote. Likewise, the
committee apparently only endorsed the
current right of the Leader and Deputy
Leader to attend the Executive, when
Mr Wyndham recommended that they
be full delegates.
It was the same with a host of other
Wyndham recommendations outright
rejection or the stalling ploy of reference
F. E. CHAMBERLAIN
to the States. However, Mr Wyndham’s
five-point scheme, aimed at providing the
Party with immediate additional finances
of £50,000 and eventually an additional
£lOO,OOO a year, came through
unscathed. If the finance proposals at
least are ratified by Conference, the
Labor Party, in spite of itself, might
lumber into the 21st century. The
Wyndham finance plan involves a com-
mittee of the Federal officers and the
Leader and Deputy Leader, which, if it
were to approach Wyndham's goal, would
relieve the Federal Party of its depend-
ence on the States and unions for funds,
leaving the door wide open for future
ad hoc reforms of a crucial kind.
As the eight-page report of the
Organising Committee was being circu-
lated, other “confidential” correspond-
ence which could influence the course of
the Federal Conference suddenly leaked
out: the photostats of a letter of the
West Australian Labor Leader, Mr A.
Hawke, to Mr Wyndham on Hawke’s
censure by the Federal Executive for his
support of Senator Kennedy's call for
talks with the DLP. This re-stirring of
the DLP controversy comes at a time
when the Victorian junta is “privately”
charging its opponents with being sym-
pathetic to the groupers. The DLP issue
is always a worry to reforming ALP
moderates because it divides the Party
into two extreme blocs as does no other
issue, and if it is raised at the Federal
Conference could completely nullify the
attempts of those trying to rally opposi-
tion against the Victorians.
However, a two-day meeting in Syd-
ney last week of the Political Committee
of the Central Committee of the Com-
munist Party showed the deep concern
at the Victorian junta's present position.
Realising that the extremist position of
the Victorian Executive on unity tickets
threatens the present tallies by the re-
involvement of the ALP as an effective
force in its own right in unions, the
Communist Party was reviewing opera-
tions.
At the time of going to press it is
expected that the Central Committee
will issue a public statement on the rela-
tionship of unions with political parties.
Included in this prqnunciamiento of
double-think will be a stinging attack on
Mr Whitlam for his recent statements
on unity tickets, in particular the New-
castle address in which the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition castigated ALP
men collaborating with Communists.
NEW GUINEA
Instant Politics
Losing the colonial luxury
Australia’s basic commitment in New
Guinea was political rather than
economic, Mr John Kerr, QC, warned
the Economic Society’s Sydney Winter
School session on New Guinea last week,
Australia will no longer be given the
old “colonialist” luxury of allowing
political independence to await economic
viability, Mr Kerr said. “The international
pressure which has, as it were, fixed our
political commitment in terms of very
speedy self-government for New Guinea,
has, in a real sense, relieved us of what
might otherwise have been regarded as
a long-term commitment to produce the
conditions -for economic viability.”
Taking for granted that the New
Guinea economy is to be subjected to

when the Australian Government is
reluctant to plan its own domestic
economy), Mr Kerr suggested that no
more than two five-year periods may
elapse before independence is reached.
Very few people on the mainland present
much evidence of thinking in terms of
such speed certainly few economists.
The job of furnishing leadership m
politics, administration, law and govern-
ment over an admittedly shortening time
is tremendously difficult. “We may well
simply have to do so.”
Mr Kerr believes Australia probably
possesses only the period of a first five-
year plan (to begin in 1966?) to provide
the Territory’s political leaders with
important political experience, to en-
courage political parties apart from
charismatic leaders, and to cope with
the intricacies of citizenship demands.
“It is by what we do and the help
we give in these political areas that we
will be finally judged.” Mr Kerr was
opening the discussion on Sydney
economist Dr Harold Bell’s meticulous
paper, “The Australian Commitment in
New Guinea”, which leaned heavily upon
the World Bank’s survey, released
recently. Dr Bell actually put forward
little fundamental criticism of the report,
although he expressed doubts on the
bank’s design for a Territory Develop-
ment Finance Company. I could not
help feeling that the economic problems
have to be tackled well this side of

VIC WORSTEAD
PACIFIC ISLANDS
Giving Voice
The conference and Commission
Big Fijian Minister for Natural Re-
sources and Oxford graduate Chief Ratu
Mara last week warned the South Pacific
Commission that unless islanders w'ere
given a greater say in their own affairs
the Commission could die a natural
death.
Chief Mara, in his not altogether un-
expected outburst, told the sixth South
Pacific Conference in Lae, New Guinea,
that the time had come for the islanders
to tell the Commission what to do. He
called for direct territorial representation
on the Commission which at present has
only representatives of the six adminis-
tering governments Australia, New
Zealand, Britain, France, America, and
Western Samoa.
He suggested that the territorial gov-
ernments should contribute to the Com-
mission’s budget, which was the only way
the islanders could voice their opinions
over the spending of the Commission’s
money. (At present the Commission’s
activity is financed by its six-member
metropolitan governments.) “And surely
the suggestion for territorial contribu-
tions should have come from the member
governments years ago,” he said. Chief
Mara told delegates the conference, and
the Commission itself, should be an ex-
tension of the financial and political train-
ing that the territorial administrations
were striving hard to give the islanders.
Under the present constitution of the
Commission any discussion at the con-
ference is ineffective because the dele-
gates have no authority. “We are as
highly sophisticated as the African
countries who sit side by side with our
administering authorities in the United
Nations discussing the problems of the
world,” the Chief said.
Chief Mara warned that if the Com-
mission continuec the way it was it would
die a natural death “and then some
different kind of South Pacific union will
arise from the ashes.”
WATERFRONT
Winds of
Change
Organised chaos
The east wind is prevailing over the
west wind on the Melbourne waterfront.
The popular pro-Moscow secretary of
the Melbourne branch of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, Charlie Young, is
likely to be absent for some months
through illness. He has twice attempted
to resign this month but strong efforts
are being made by the local Moscow-
line Communists to keep him in the
position of normal leadership.
The present acting secretary of the
Melbourne WWF, Peking - liner Ted
Bull, would be certain to win any election
for secretary at the present time. In
Young’s absence, Bull and his supporters
have been able to organise a series of
stoppages which have brought chaos to
the Melbourne waterfront in recent
weeks. Young is reported to have been
opposed to many of these and to have
severely criticised their instigators in
private.
Although he is known as a Moscow-
liner, Young is believed by many water-
side workers to have allowed his Com-
munist Party membership •to lapse. He
has often tried to settle disputes by
negotiation in recent years and has
worked closely with ALP members of
the WWF.
Bull and his supporters have been able
to isolate completely the moderate ALP
president of the Melbourne WWF, Les
Stuart, and are able to dominate water-
side meetings with their vocal strength
and tight organisation.
The only hope ALP men hold of de-
feating the Bull faction lies in the possi-
bility of its gradually alienating support
because of its persistent militancy. How-
ever, so long as the Victorian ALP
Executive refuses to endorse ALP candi-
dates in union elections, the chances
of moderate ALP men winning the Mel-
bourne waterfront will remain slim.

clause in the unions’ awards. When the
applications came before Commonwealth
Conciliation Commissioner Mr J. P.
Horan early last week, union officials
argued that a bans clause at that stage
would be unfair because the unions were
endeavoring to negotiate. Mr Horan
noted that the climate appeared favor-
able for negotiations and adjourned the
applications until this week. Meanwhile,
the unions had sought a deputation to
the Premier, Mr R. W. Askin, and the
Minister for Transport, Mr M. A. Morris,
to have negotiations re-opened. The
unions, however, are not optimistic
about negotiations. The Government’s
offer of 10s. a week for tradesmen and
non-tradesmen was the answer to the
unions’ claim for increases ranging from
16s. 6d to 495. 6d.
In spite of the unions’ conciliatory
approach last week, there will be further
stoppages and the next almost certainly
will be called late in the afternoon for
the following day—preventing the im-
position of a bans clause and penalties
of up to £SOO a day for each union.
The metal trades unions are now
pressing for another stoppage —four
hours being the suggested duration—to
be followed by an overtime ban through-
out the Government transport service.
While the ban will have the backing of
union leaders it will be most unpopular
with members who depend on overtime
at present. Boilermakers, for example,
worked the Saturday before the last
strike at penalty rates and then followed
up with four nights’ work in the week
after the stoppage. The result was that
they received more money in the week
of the strike than they had for some time.
In such circumstances strikes are hardly
a burden.
JOHN BROCKETT
ACTU
Confrontation
The basic wage issue
Manoeuvring adroitly in its attempts to
get a review of the recent majority de-
cision of the Arbitration Commission tine
ACTU followed up its previous week’s
refusal to be stampeded into peremptory
aC’on by the rank and file by using the
economic talks in Canberra last week to
put the Government itself on the spot.
The Government was told the ACTU
wanted action as good as suggested by
the Minister for Labor, Mr W. Mc-
Mahon, himself, on the morrow of the
Commission’s verdict. The ACTU al-
leged Mr McMahon had stated: “If the
unions were dissatisfied they had an ob-
vious remedy, to convince the Commis-
sion by argument in future that yester-
day’s decision was wrong.”
On the basis of this, the ACTU stated
it expected the Government to intervene
in its case to the Commission “directed
towards creating the opportunity of con-
vincing by argument the Commission,
constituted in the most practicable form,
that the decision was wrong”.
However, it stopped short of saying
it expected the Government to support
the ACTU’s case in substance, as it went
on to. say: “What the Commonwealth

vocal terms. “We totally reject,” it said,
“any concept which envisages wage fixa-
tion being undertaken by the Commis-
sion essentially in terms of economic
regulation, unless such consideration of
wage levels is part of an overall effective
regulation of all incomes and prices.”
Indeed, strange as it may seem, the
members of the Commission all rejected
part of the employers’ total wage claim
precisely on this main ground, but the
majority judgment went half way to-
wards it in merging basic wage and
margins cases because the old procedure
of separate hearings, in its view, involved
double counting of capacity to pay a
practice which obviously is of great ad-
vantage to the unions in the determina-
tion of award wages.
However, the ACTU did not lose the
opportunity afforded by its economic
talko with the Government to protest in
the strongest terms on the line the Com-
monwealth took a L the latest hearings
when it strongly opposed any increase in
award wages in what the ACTU called
“a doleful document that made the pro-
phecies of Jeremiah look like the rav-
ings of an unbridled optimist”. It
taunted that on every possible occasion
outside the Commission the Government
sang the praises of the country’s eco-
nomic growth, reserving gloomy forebod-
ings only for the audience of the Com-
mission. This was all the more galling
i that, said the ACTU, the Government
had interceded in the proceedings as a
neutra< party. ThL was less than honest
and left the ACTU with absolutely no
respect for the Government.

JUSTICE
Solitary
“Cruel and wrong ”
“I believe it (solitary confinement), in
its effects, to be cruel and wrong . .
there is a depth of terrible endurance in
it which none but the sufferers can
fathon' and which r.o man has a right
to inflict on his fellow creature. I hold
this slow and daily tampering with the
mysteries of the brain to be immeasur-
ably worse than any torture of the body
. . . I the more denounce it, as a secret
punishment which slumbering humanity
is not roused up to stay.”
This was Charles Dickens’ indictment
of solitary confinement—expressed in
“American Notes” —more than a century
ago. Last week there were at least some
blinks from slumbering humanity at the
sentence of 14 days’ solitary for Darcy
Dug' and seven days for lan Sidney
Henke, both convicted of escaping from
a New South Wales prison farm at
Tumbarumba.
The penalties, meted out by a visiting
magistrate at Goulburn Gaol, where the
prisoners were removed following an
official enquiry begun after prison offi-
cials found evidence that some prison-
ers had been leaving the prison farm at
Tumbarumba overnight, were not un-
usual. But the fact that the conviction
meant the end of Dugan’s—who has serv-
ed 15 years of an indeterminate life
sentence for the attempted murder of a
bank officer—hopes fv)r an early parole
helped sharpen some consciences on the
mediaeval penalty of solitary confine-
ment.
Why does solitary confinement still
persist as a prison punishment? “It is
a matter of expediency,” the Sydney
criminologist Mr Gordon Hawkins told
The Bulletin. Remissions for good
behavior diminish as incentive the longer
the prison sentence is. Loss of privileges
apparently is of little deterrent. And
dietary punishments—-the official euphe-
mism for bread and water —cannot be
policed unless the prisoner is in solitary
confinement.
“So until there is a reasonable alter-
native for infringements of prison discip-
line, solitary is likely to remain,” said
Mr Hawkins. Dugan and Henke still
face charges of car-stealing in the Goul-
burn Court of Petty Sessions.
Order of the Boot
From ALAN REID in Canberra
Defence Minister Senator Shane
Paltridge, Supply Minister Allen Fair-
hall and Army Minister Jim Forbes
(and anyone else even remotely in-
volved) are likely to be well and truly
carpeted in the privacy of Cabinet
this week over the foul-up with Army
boots and uniforms in Vietnam.
Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies,
an oldtimer who does not believe in
airing his Government’s administrative
shortcomings in public, was at his
affable best in noting, at his Press con-
ference, the fact that Australian
soldiers with unusual foot
fittings were being sup-
plied in Vietnam with
boots of World War II
vintage, and the stitching
of these and combat fati-
gues had rotted swiftly.
The boots? Forbes was
up there in Vietnam and
would be back with a
first-hand report and
things would then be fix-
ed up smartly. The clothing? Menzies
pointed out that any traveller with
experience in the tropics knew what
happened with clothing. He had had
this experience himself. Menzies
could hardly be said to have evaded
the issue, but he handled it so deftly
and was round it so fast that obvious
questions which give it quite consider-
able importance were left hanging in
the air. Menzies and some of his
senior colleagues cannot be happy
about the position, however casually
they seem to treat it in public.
But in this case the commander of
the Australian battalion in Vietnam,
Lieutenant-Colonel Brumfield, ripped
a pair of combat fatigues to pieces in
the presence of Mr Forbes. Brum-
field is obviously a responsible level-
headed and balanced officer, other-
wise the Government would not have
appointed him to command the bat-
talion. If he is ripping to pieces
clothing that, while good, was never-
theless due to fall to pieces because
of tropical wear, he has an unusual
sense of drama for a senior military
officer. A much more likely explana-
tion is that he ripped the clothing to
pieces to demonstrate that its de-
terioration was excessive, even in the
conditions in which it
vyas being used.
The excuse, that the
faulty boots were issued
only because there were
men among the 800-odd
Australians in the bat-
talion in Vietnam with
unusual foot fittings, is
similarly feeble.
The Army here is deal-
ing with under 1000
men. Apart from ensuring that the men
who are engaged in what, the Prime
Minister insists, are the operations of
war, should be equipped with the best
material they need for the tasks they
are doing, the whole operation should
be viewed as a training for the future.
If the Army cannot deal with less
than 1000 men without providing a
proportion of them with faulty foot-
wear —and although there have been
official statements justifying the faulty
footwear, there has been no state-
ment denying that they were faulty—
it is a not unreasonable assumption
that a much higher proportion will be
provided with faulty footwear when
the Army is dealing with the supply
of many thousands.


A Man For All Seasons?
How the British see Sir Robert
A sk that demonic, fag-in-mouth figure,
the average Englishman, about Sir
Robert Menzies and he may well bruise
your patriotic sensibilities. A fair number
will hit the mark and identify him as the
chap who stands with the Queen in the
photos of the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers but, as a recent survey con-
ducted by myself in an East End pub re-
vealed, there were other interpretations,
too. “Bob Menzies?” said the barman,
polishing glasses with a Cunard towel.
“He was a fair disgrace in the Corona-
tion Stakes, mate. Never gave the horse
a chance.”
“This one’s in politics,” I said. “Prime
Minister of Australia.”
"Him?" said the barman. “Oh aye, I
know him. Saw him on the telly the
other night.”
I thanked him, put my question to a
knot of drinkers, and learnt that he was
also a bankrupt tycoon, the coach of
the Cambridge boat and a Cornish town
crier who could, on a favorable day,
be heard in France. Most of the remain-
der knew of him because they had vested
interests in Australia; uncles plumbing
in Queensland, brothers and sons grap-
pling with a new destiny somewhere in
the Riverina. A couple of them had mas-
tered, by letter, the mechanics of two-up,
and conversation, as we tossed and called,
showed that Menzies, as far as my com-
panions were concerned, was the only
statesman the continent possessed; the
name Calwell, for example, provoked
only blank stares and a few vacant grins.
I drained my mug and went out into
the streets, bemused at the knowledge

of “Punch”.
that this disinterested who-he? attitude
was in tune with a hefty segment of the
British population. The literati know who
Menzies is, all right, but the masses
(oops) need time to remember and their
knowledge is conditioned by sheer repe-
tition. Like the annual arrival of the auk,
he has become one of the minor but in-
escapable facts of life simply because,
year in and year out, he keeps on turning
up. Sir Robert today, along with the
fleets of Rolls-Royces and police escorts,
is part of the standard equipment of
Prime Ministers’ Conferences. There is
respect for his longevity but also an un-
spoken feeling that Australian politics
must be pretty humdrum to throw up the
same high priest for 16 consecutive years.
What also detracts from his impact
is the fact that, to the majority of English-
men, Australia is thought of primarily
in terms of sweat and muscle and athletic
achievement* they see us, loosely, as a
nation busily cutting our infants’ teeth
on cricket stumps and knocking tennis
balls about the Nullarbor Plain. The
Australian Government, over here, has a
sort of Town Council feel about it and
has not yet achieved the distinction of
being thought of as a separate, signifi-
cant entity; the word Canberra, for ex-
ample, is not quite as evocative as Wash-
ington. And because Sir Robert isn’t
leathery and fierce, because he doesn’t
talk fluent Strine, he is regarded as rather
a tame extension, a sort of artificial limb.
The English feel that he is not strictly
true to type. If the country could only
produce a more representative Prime
Minister, a Chips Rafferty figure in a
bushwhacker hat who did a pubcrawl on
the way to the Palace, who addressed
the Duke of Edinburgh as “mate” or pos-
sibly “cock”, then he would probably be
regarded as authentic and perhaps even
loved.
A few days ago I struck up conver-
sation with a man on a train. He was
a stockbroker and he approved of Sir
Robert. “Splendid fellow,” he said. “With-
out him Australia would by now be an
American State. “Why,” he added, brush-
ing Corona-Corona ash from his Guards
tie, “he could almost be one of us.” This,
I suspect, is half the trouble. Sir Robert,
doubtless a crackling iconoclast on home
ground, here tends to blend. He has, by
common consent, become an honorary
member of the Establishment, the only
current Commonwealth PM to have re-
ceived that rather dubious accolade, and
the Establishment regard him as
thoroughly dependable, a man for all
seasons. They have here, unfortunately,
little opportunity for experiencing at first
hand the aspect of the man which charac-
terises him at home the brilliance, the
wit, the staggering self-confidence. Men-
zies in Britain projects a grave, sober,
frock-coated image. He is given to plati-
tudes on burning issues like Queen and
Country which don’t go down terribly
well with the atavistic young merito-
cracy who like to kick the country round
a bit. They respect his stature, his sheer
endurance, but they find him a bit old
hat, a bit too willing to step into line,
no questions asked, with official White-
hall policy. Yet these are not voiced ob-
jections; they do not sit glibly on the
tips of people’s tongues; they are only
pronounced when the interviewee is
given a few minutes to mull the thing
over.
Vet there are contradictions. Recently
I viewed, with an industrial chemist
and his wife, a showing of Panorama, the
BBC's self-styled window on the world.

They were running a potted biography of
Menzies. “Now there,” said the wife,
watching Bob stumping the boondocks
and annihilating hecklers with awesome
point and counterpoint, “is a man I could
respect.”
“A natural leader,” agreed her hus-
band. “What would I give to see him
take the Tories back to No. 10? Just the
chap,” he added wistfully, “to rough
up de Gaulle and put France back in
perspective.”
“And stop the run on the pound,” she
said.
“And liquidate George Brown.”
“And get some cash out of the Ger-
mans for the Rhine Army.”
“Right,” said the chemist, breaking
open a carton of sugared plums. “In
short, the answer to the Conservative
Party’s prayer.” They were impressed
with his spirit, his authority and, oddly
enough, his accent fiat, educated and
classless. Wilson’s is Northern and Gram-
mar School, Home’s is landed and Eton
but Menzies’ is that of the universal man.
There is no avoiding, however, that the
ripple Menzies causes here is a minor
one. Not for him the stirrings accorded
to a Kennedy, a Khrushchev or even a
Nkrumah, and to some extent the fault
(or virtue) lies not so much with Sir
Robert as with his country. Off the
sports field Australia, as a nation, rarely
makes the headlines. Why should she?
She is fat and prosperous and hardly in
a position to compete with the bombings,
riots and revolution that constitute con-
temporary breakfast table fare. If, on
the other hand, Canberra could be per-
suaded to launch a couple of Blue
Streaks at Sukarno, or join , the Com-
munist Bloc, or put a boong into orbit,
then the English will certainly pay more
attention the next time Sir Robert alights
here from his V-Jet.
Another significant factor, and one
that keeps gnawing at my conscience, is
that the Britain which shaped Sir Robert’s
original attitudes, his fervent Anglophilia,
is now very dead indeed. That, bless
it, was the gracious era of champagne
and strawberries on the lawn, of the ben-
evolent gunboat, of Wooster and Gussie
Fink-Nottle. But today it is Jeeves who
is master; grammar schools and scholar-
ships have elevated him straight to the
Presidency of the National Coal Board,
Britain is drifting uneasily in no very
definite direction, the pink flag of social-
ism drooping from the masthead, the
captain having a hell of a job keeping
his crew in order. In the midst of won-
dering what the English think of Sir
Robert, one might well take time off to
ponder precisely what Sir Robert, be-
hind that shrewd eye and dignified ex-
terior, currently thinks of the English.


Commonwealth
Count-down
“A cow you can milk but don’t have to feed ”
Seventeen heads of government and
four senior ministers attended the
Prime Ministers’ Conference in Lon-
don last month. Three-quarters of them
were non-whites; nine were Africans.
The majority represented republics for
whom the British monarchy is almost, if
not quite, irrelevant. Several are one-
party States, in name or in fact, and
have eschewed many of the basic prin-
ciples of the rule of law and of parlia-
mentary democracy.
Out of the 21 countries, only the four
“old” Commonwealth members the
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and
New Zealand—are not in desperate need
of capital, technological development,
more industries, greater primary pro-
duction, and means of coping with a
rapidly increasing population. In the
solution of these problems, Common-
wealth assistance is rarely more than
marginal.
Yet the fact that so many national
leaders should take ten days out of a
busy schedule is an answer to those who
assert that the Commonwealth no longer
has any significance or purpose.
Obviously it has significance to these
leaders, or they would not have attended.
In his Press conference in Canberra
last week, Sir Robert Menzies spoke
nostalgically of the “old Common-
wealth”. The nostalgia is understandable,
but it does not help us to understand or
cope with the present. Prime Ministers’
meetings 20 or even ten years ago were
certainly more intimate, friendly, and
comfortable —a handful of “like-minded”
men around a table at 10 Downing Street,
with a British deference to orderly
procedure and good manners, confiden-
tial discussions, and a brief and unani-
mous communique issued at the end.
Today they are large, dissonant, cos-
mopolitan gatherings at a spacious ex-
royal residence, with a hundred people
in the conference room; public relations
exercises, with copies of speeches and
versions of the debate gladly given (some-
times in advance) to the Press; oppor-
tunities for declaiming and disclaiming,
for pressuring, posturing and platitudin-
ising. Imagine the Communist Chinese
Charge d’Affaires walking into 10 Down-
nations of Asia and, more especially, of
Africa, are less concerned with the
niceties of diplomacy than the needs of
hungry bellies and the unappeased resent-
ment against often vicarious racial and
economic humiliation. They are aware
that noise and numbers make news, and
can influence the actions of the more
powerful. Hence the attempt, fortunately
unsuccessful, to introduce the “con-
sensus” procedure. Many have not yet
worked out the most judicious combina-
tion of reason and emotion, but they
are learning.
To them, the Commonwealth provides
one of the very few milieux open to
them for making their points to an
attentive audience which includes poten-
tial—if not very large—benefactors. As
has been said, it is “a cow you can milk
but don’t have to feed”. It is a smaller
and more receptive company (than, say,
the UN) for enlisting support for favorite
causes, such as against Indonesian con-
frontation or Portuguese colonialism or
apartheid, and for exerting influence on
the principal remaining European colonial
power, the United Kingdom.
The public pressuring and posturing
are believed necessary concomitants of
these activities. They are expected by
the folks back home, especially the
African folks. Nkrumah, Nyerere and
Kenyatta have done more to change the
character of the Commonwealth and the
Commonwealth meetings than Smuts,
Mackenzie King and Nehru, even though
each is more the product than the pro-
ducer of his times.
For the African and Asian members,
the Commonwealth is also a club, in-
herited from theiT history, somewhat dis-
credited by Britain’s relative decline in
power and financial capacity, and the
whiteness of British skins, but in which

ing Street and demanding to see the
President of Pakistan! Yet he did this,
apparently successfully, at Marlborough
House. The communique issued on June
25 ran (including attachments) to 13
foolscap pages; and the European edition
of the “New York Times” did not even
mention it.
What this means is that the Common-
wealth, like the world of which it is
increasingly representative a part, has
changed in some ways for the better,
in some ways no doubt for the worse
but inevitably and irrevocably. The new
they can find fellowship and to which
they are told they lend prestige.
Yet Sir Robert was right, if not very
diplomatic, to stress the problems which
their raucousness, their propensity to
condemn Britain, and their Left-ward
adventures in foreign policy can bring
to the Commonwealth as a whole. The
raucousness will probably abate, as will
the propensity to condemn Britain once
the Rhodesian situation is less inflamma-
tory. But for years now the Common-
wealth meetings have included members
who could scarcely be considered trusted

repositories of confidential political or
military information, the exchange of
which had long been a special feature
of the Commonwealth relationship.
This situation has worsened in the last
twelve months. Tanzania (formerly Tan-
ganyika and Zanzibar) has Communist
Chinese military advisers and equipment.
(The Zanzibar delegates actually wore
their “Chinese” blue uniforms to the
conference.) A senior member of the
Kenyan cabinet is an open supporter of
Peking; while the London “Economist”
claims that Mr Kenyatta did not attend
the Prime Ministers’ conference so as
to avoid the charge (by Communist
China) of being a tool of the British and
the Americans. This may be too simple
an explanation, but a Communist Chinese
influence greater than a normal deference
to reasonable susceptibilities was ap-
parent in the discussions and comes out
in the communique. One delegate from
a new Commonwealth country was heard
to say that the business of the conference
would have been more expeditiously con-
ducted if Communist Chinese officials
had been personally present. Neverthe-
less, as shown in the reiterated decision,
to seek postponement of the Algiers con-
ference, the influence was largely con-
tained. It can probally be contained in
the future, but it does introduce a dis-
quieting and vitiating element into the
Commonwealth’s deliberations.
What does the Commonwealth mean
for Britain? Some of the strongest doubts
about the Commonwealth, interestingly
enough, are in Britain. An article by “a
Conservative” in the London “Times”
in April of last year spoke of the Com-
monwealth as a “gigantic farce”, shot
through with humbug, absurdities, and
outworn fictions. In London a few w'eeks
ago an Englishman told me he thought
the Commonwealth was a good w'ay f o
make foreigners feel less than foreign—
which surprised me, as I had been
brought up to believe what my passport
still maintains, that I am less than
foreign, in fact not really foreign at all.
London is still the centre of numerous
Commonwealth activities, but Lord Casey
is one of the many who could tell of
distressingly unsuccessful attempts to
stimulate British interest in Common-
wealth matters and projects not that
this lack of interest is confined to Britain.
Certainly, the Labor Government has
given a new impetus to British concern
about the Commonwealth, partly as a
counterplay to the Conservative Party
and a counterweight to Europe and to
the United States. We do not know
how long Mr Wilson’s precarious
majority will continue, nor can we be
yet sure whither his party’s foreign and

Commonwealth policy is tending. There
are strong “Europeans” in the Cabinet.
The costs associated with maintaining so
large a military commitment east of Suez
are prompting demands for a contraction
of responsibilities, a contracting out of
“Commonwealth” commitments, of very
direct relevance to Australia.
Yet we must accept that, at the Prime
Ministers’ Conference and in other policy
statements and decisions, the present
British Government has appeared deter-
mined to maintain and strengthen the
Commonwealth in every way it can.
The Commonwealth is not tending
towards closer special trading relation-
ships. In fact, this is the one area where
the Commonwealth’s inter se doctrine
has become contrary to desired and
desirable (if attainable) world objectives.
As other trade barriers are lowered,
preferences become less inviting. Un-
fortunately, the relative decline of intra-
Commonwealth trade and the attenua-
tion of Commonwealth preference have
occurred at the same time as the develop-
ment of a potentially much more severe
and restrictive “preferential” system
the European Common Market. The
issues are too complex for discussion
in a few sentences, but the hope must be
that the Commonwealth will continue to
cushion its economically weaker mem-
bers against the harshness of inter-
national trading while wider arrange-
ments are being worked out.
is little prospect, either, of a
substantial increase in economic and
technical aid from richer Common-
wealth members to poorer ones. In
Britain’s case, her chronic balance of
payments problem would necessitate
tying additional aid to British purchases.
The two other main donors, Canada and
Australia, are for internal political
reasons unlikely to increase overseas aid
appreciably, and even if they did the
overall effect would be slight. Marginal
increments are possible, and desired by
the “developing” members.
There were three signs at the con-
ference which gave hope for the future
of the Commonwealth—the creation of
a permanent secretariat, the establishment
of the Commonwealth Foundation, aiid
the initiative over Vietnam.
A Commonwealth Secretariat was pro-
posed by Mr Curtin in 1943 but was not
then acceptable. It has been promoted
now by Afro-Asian members who see in
it a lever for greater influence and per-
haps greater or more efficient economic
and other assistance, and has been
accepted by the others .because of the
size of the membership and the need for
a clearing-house. How the Secretary-
General develops his role in resisting
the pressures from the two groups, will
determine not only the Secretariat’s
future but perhaps also that of the Com-
monwealth. For some members, in-
cluding Australia, the more the Common-
wealth becomes like the United Nations,
the less desirable and necessary will
membership in it be.
The Foundation, which will administer
a fund for increasing exchanges between
professional organisations, is but the
latest of many semi-official and unofficial
Commonwealth institutions which con-
stitute so great a part of the fabric of
Commonwealth relationships. The Foun-
dation should boost their activities.
The imaginative initiative for a Com-
monwealth Mission on Vietnam, despite
the undertones of domestic political
advantage for the British Prime Minister,
was welcomed by all but one member
(Tanzania). Its timing in terms of the
general political and military situation
was unfortunate. If it appears to have
failed in its main purpose, it showed that
there are situations in which Common-
wealth countries can operate together
and make use of their diversity for a
valuable international purpose. Any
further attempts will need to be carefully
done, but the Vietnam mission provides
an interesting precedent.
The old intimacy and confidence have
gone—but not between those few who
used to have it. The meetings are noisy,
public affairs, but the world is a noisy,
public place these days. Commonwealth
membership will presumably stabilise at
about 25, and committees and rap-
porteurs will be called into being. Its
institutions, once eschewed, will preserve
at least the form and perhaps also the
fact of the Commonwealth. There is no
overall political or economic or defence
community, but it still is true that
valuable arrangements of a political,
economic or military kind are made in
the name of the Commonwealth, which
would probably not be made if there
were no Commonwealth.
Perhaps the lesson from the meeting
in June is not that the Commonwealth
suffered, but that it survived; that it even
grew, a little; that the more extreme
elements had a moderating influence
successfully (for the most part) brought
to bear upon them; that it provided
many useful bilateral contacts; that its
multi-racial character was more apparent
than ever.
If these are the Commonwealth’s
present attributes, its-prospects are favor-
able. For Australians no less than
British, Ghanaians or West Indians, the
Commonwealth is not only a matter of
history, it is a matter of will.


Feeling the pressure
of paper work?
Concerned about Decimal Currency?
You need Data Processing
know what it really costs?
If you’re typical of thousands of Australian businessmen, you’re probably plagued by a
mass of routine accounting. Are you finding it increasingly difficult to keep deadlines for
statement despatch, payrolls, trading reports? Does your stock record system let you down
with costly stock run-outs? Will decimal conversion add to your difficulties? If paper-work
is your problem, there’s a timely solution—lßM Data Processing.
With your situation in mind, IBM has devised two specific plans. They put at your
immediate disposal all the benefits of data processing (without having to purchase the
equipment) at a surprisingly reasonable cost.
THE IBM RENTAL PLAN
installs Data Processing on your own premises at
rentals that run as low as £250 per month. This
small company system handles routine accounting
operations and provides the control and measure-
ment you need over the vital operations of your
business.
9SE t
THE IBM DATA SERVICE CENTRE
provides data processing services to customers large
and small. Expert IBM staff will accept full respon-
sibility for prompt, accurate processing of your work,,
or you may prefer to hire these facilities and process
your own work. Fees are surprisingly reasonable, the
cost being based on actual facility usage or on block
time, weekly, daily even hourly,
What will this mean to your business? In one step, it
places you on a competitive footing with businesses
already using these modern methods. It eliminates
inaccuracy, delay and 'the high cost of manual
methods. It gives.you prompt trading results and
informed control over trading operations. All this,’
and more, at a controllable cost, with no capital
outlay.
The hiring charges are tax'deductible.
One of these low-cost IBM Data Processing
plans could well be the ideal solution to your
biggest business problems.

ON THE MARGIN
Unplanned Families
T had some drinks last week with the
■*’ Vert brothers—lntro, Extra, Con,
and Per. They are an interesting family,
widely divergent in their tastes, yet re-
taining something in common.
Intro is reserved and melancholy, a
book-reviewer by occupation, given to
biting his nails; while cheerful, hearty
Extra does well in the used car business
and is on the committee of his golf club.
Con is happy in his religious faith and
a keen worker for the DLP. The black
sheep of the family is Per, but he is
such a droll little fellow that it is hard
to dislike him.
It is not uncommon, of course, for
members of the same family to have con-
trasting qualities. One remembers the
well-known case of the Zolas, Emile and
Gorgon, who were
as different as chalk
and cheese.
Then there are the
Tard twins, Bus and
Bas, who are far
from identical. The
less pleasant of the
two is, I am afraid,
the more successful.
Very little is seen of
Bus these days, but Bas is flourishing
you seem to run into him everywhere.
I have noticed that often in largish
families, such as the Verts, there is one
member who lets the others down by
moral laxity. The Cators are typical.
Most of them are solid citizens Indi
does useful work in the railways, Dupli
has a steady job in the public service, and
Fabri manages a factory. Yet their young
brother Forni the best-looking of the
family causes them endless embarrass-
ment by his irresponsible behavior.
The Graphers are another example.
They are mostly skilled employees, like
Litho and Steno, or professional workers
of good standing, such as Photo and Bio.
Yet the same family produced Porno,
who is not only less respectable but far
more prosperous than all the rest. Pub-
lishers and moving picture producers
compete eagerly for Porno’s work, while
other Graphers look on with envy.
One comes across some amusingly
mixed strains of kinfolk. Take the Pets,
who seemed rather dull, with the hum-
drum Car and the secretive Lim. Quite
suddenly they burst forth with the jolly
siblings Strum and Crum. And there are
the Olds, too. Thresh puts on airs now
and mixes with psychologists, while poor
Cuck is still treated as a joke.
At the risk of laboring a point made
above, I must draw attention to the
curious situation among the Courses.
The head of this family was the verbose,
often boring Dis. Other members were
the useful Water and the sporty Race,
who got the most publicity. They
regarded cousin Inter as a common little
thing. Yet many found her attractive,
and she has become universally popular.
In the power to command public atten-
tion, Inter now puts all the other Courses
in the shade.
For a journalist it is helpful to have
contacts among these varied families.
When an editor asks me to go out and
get a cross-section of public opinion, I
usually make for the
bar where the Vert
brothers foregather.
Thus it was that I
came to question
them last week on
the subject of The
Pill.
Extra was charac-
teristically direct.
“She’s a b good
idea, the old Pill, as long as she works,”
he said. “Did you hear about the girl
who got them mixed up with aspirins?”
Intro smiled bitterly. “Anyone who
thinks the Pill will be a guarantee of
instant happiness is singularly naive,”
he said.
Con declared firmly: “I regard use of
the Pill as sinful.”
Per tittered and said: “It doesn't really
concern me, but I might take some for
fun.”
On the basis of what the Verts told
me, I was able to write a good round-up
of interviews, attributing the opinions
to spokesmen, experts, and well-informed
observers^
Not all such family groups are equally
helpful. The Crats, for instance —Aristo,
Pluto, and Demo —tend to be pompous
and doctrinaire. And one naturally keeps
clear of the Omaniacs —Mon, Megal,
Dips, Klept, and the rest. Nymph is the
most agreeable of them, but even she
spells trouble.
You can usually hear a stimulating
discussion, however, from the three
Factors Max, Bene, and Male. It
always ends in a ding-dong row between
Bene and Male, with Max trying to
persuade them to make up.

Wild Life and
Civilised People
The Moorehead method of research
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Australian - born author Alan
Moorehead has just returned to his
home in Italy after four months
here studying Australia’s diminishing
wild life and what seems to him to be
her increasingly civilised people.
Mr Moorehead, brushing the dust of
North Queensland off his clothes at
Sydney’s poets’ pub, the Belvedere,
before he left, said that although he had
been to Australia several times since he
first left 30 years ago this had been the
first time he felt he had begun to relate
again to the life and people.
Sydney, he felt, was now one of the
most amusing cities in the world to live
in. Melbourne seemed much as he had
left it 30 years ago.
“When I left here I made a complete
break,” he said. “I led a totally different
life. I married an Englishwoman. My
children were educated in England. But
now Australia has cast a shadow over
me again. Not in a sinister way, of
course.”
Australia even seems to be casting a
shadow over Mr Moorehead's life in
Italy. Alwyn Lee, one of the legendary
figures of Sydney and Melbourne jour-
nalism of the ’thirties and for many
years a book reviewer for “Time”
magazine, is staying at Mr Moorehead’s
house at Porto Ercole at the moment.
He is writing a memoir of life in Aus-
tralia in the ’thirties. Robert Hughes,
the Sydney artist and critic, is living in
the village and working on his book,
“Irrational Imagery in Art”. Mr Moore-
head thinks Hughes is “brilliant” and
predicts a great future for him, as a
writer, given a bit of discipline, which
Mr Moorehead doesn’t plan to ad-
minister. Mr Moorehead is expecting
writer Cyril Pearl to show up any day
and hopes artist Russell Drysdale will
visit him later.
Mr Moorehead was in Australia to
gather material for a future book and
also to make a film on Australian wild
life with Robert Raymond of Project ’65.
This programme will be shown later this
year. However, Mr Moorehead during
his visit related so closely to theatrical
life that he was commissioned by the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust to write, with
“The Sydney Morning Herald” music
critic, Mr Roger Covell, a libretto for
an opera for which Mr Peter Sculthorpe
will do the score.
This project, Mr Moorehead said, was
great fun. The opera is based on the
story of Mrs Fraser, who was ship-
wrecked off the Queensland coast and
brought back to civilisation by
Aborigines. Mr Moorehead said his part
in the project was merely to “give the
story dramatic shape”. He admitted he
knew little about music, but said that
Mr Covell was an expert musicologist.
The libretto would merely be roughed
out so that Mr Sculthorpe would be able
to begin writing the music during his
time in the United States on a Harkness
fellowship later this year.
However, Mr Sculthorpe and Mr
Covell have already had one experience
of the Moorehead method of research
when he induced them to visit Fraser
Island off the Queensland coast. “Scul-
thorpe got all sorts of ideas for the music
from the trip,” Mr Moorehead said. Mr
Moorehead has also paced out the
Sydney Opera House main stage, but his
ambitions do not really, run so high.
“Perhaps it will be put on at the Adelaide
Festival,” he said. “But whatever hap-
pens is well in the future.”
During his busy four months, Mr
Moorehead has also espoused the cause
of a local film and television
arguing from a position of greater
strength and with more good humor than
most of the true believers. He has also
spoken up for a much neglected segment,
journalists. “Journalists in this country
are very poorly paid by overseas stan-
dards,” he said. “I was telling the editor
of a metropolitan paper this last night.
He agreed, but said, ‘Well, there it is’.”
Mr Moorehead’s next two books may
cast a shadow over Australia. He was
correcting galley proofs of the first be-
fore he left Sydney. This is “The Fatal
Impact” which will be published by
Hamish Hamilton in Britain early next
year. It is, he said, simply a study of
the coming of the white man to the South
Pacific between 1760 and 1840, concen-
trating on three areas, the east coast of
Australia, on Antarctica and Tahiti. “I
just say, this is what these places were
like before the white man came; this
is the aftermath,” he said.
The next book will be a description
of Australia before the white man came.
Mr Moorehead hopes to reconstruct as
accurately as possible the natural life
on the sub-continent and the life of the
Aborigines before they were disturbed.
His travels over Eastern Australia this
year have been part of his research on
the subject. Next year he plans to visit
Arnhem Land and the Kimberleys.
During the winter in Italy he will read
on the subject. He said too that he had
drawn considerable inspiration on the
subject from Australian artists, such as
Drysdale.

Mr Moorehead likes to have a good
look at a place before he writes about
it, “to sniff the breeze”, he calls it. How-
ever, he said, more of his time was now
occupied with research and reading.
Although he works quickly enough
when he gets down to writing—three or
four hours a day, seven days a week,
a book finished in six to eight months —
he is now happy with one book every
four or five years.
“These days I rewrite more,” he said.
“The words are harder to find. As you
get older you get less inspiration, but,
I suppose, you make fewer mistakes.”
Mr Moorehead, solidly established as
a best-selling author, and one who has
had honor, good reviews and good sales
in his own country, can afford to wait
for inspiration, to space his books and
to pick and choose his subjects.
However, his books with Australian
subjects have been somewhat less success-
ful than some of his other titles. For
example, “Gallipoli” showed him how
unpredictable the book market is.
“My publishers were very keen about
it.” he said. “So were the booksellers.
The publishers went ahead and printed
30.000 copies. We waited for the critics.
They liked it. It was the perfect situa-
tion for the big bestseller I think the
publishers might still have 10,000 copies.
Oh. I suppose they’ve got rid of them
now but it was slow going.”
“Cooper's Creek” didn’t do as well as
the titles which preceded it “perhaps
people aren’t interesting in reading about
Australia, or you can have the right book
at the wrong time” but Mr Moorehead
explained that with the Nile books, “No
Room in the Ark” and “The Russian
Revolution”, he had a very good half-
dozen years.
“They were all serialised in The New
Yorker’ and The Sunday Times’,” he
said. “And they were all books of the
month in the United States.”
The Nile books have sold a million
copies, but those days may not come
again for Mr Moorehead, a fact which
does not seem to perturb hint unduly. He
is sure that Morris West is a much bigger
seller than he is, although he agrees
there is a chance some of his books will
go on selling longer than Mr West’s.
He will stop off in Hollywood on his
way to Italy. One company has an
option on “Cooper’s Creek” and Cine-
rama are talking of filming the Nile
books.
Another aspect of publishing which
amazes him at the moment is the decision
of his publishers to reissue his World
War II books “Mediterranean Front”,
“A Year of Battle”, and “The End of
Africa” —in hardback. “Would you read
about World War II now?” he asked.
“I certainly wouldn’t.” Would he like to
relive his war correspondent days, say,
in Vietnam? “God, no. I’ve had my
turn. They can send the young chaps.”
In Search of Art
Expressed Without Fear
By JUDITH RICH
Miss Senta Taft, who runs a gallery
for primitive art at Paddington,
Sydney, has recently returned
from her second expedition to West
Irian. This was undertaken shortly after
Indonesia left the United Nations, and
against the advice of all Miss Taft’s
friends.
“I flew into Djakarta shortly after
Christmas,” Miss Taft said. “I was
shaking with trepidation.” However,
many of her Indonesian friends, in-
cluding Mr Tone Amboro, who is Presi-
dent Sukarno’s police pilot, were at the
airport to welcome her. They had
already gained permission for her to
proceed to West Irian to collect samples
of native art.
Miss Taft, who said that normally the
chances of field work in West Irian were
“hopeless” for British subjects, was
granted facilities through President
Sukarno’s secretary. “If President Sukar-
no likes you he will do anything for
you,” she said. “He will give you the
world. The Minister for West Irian,
Dr Logowo, a charming man, is very
pro-Australian. He has made many
friends among Australians who pass
through Indonesia.”
Miss Taft, who was born in Hanover,
has lived in Australia on and off for the
past 20 years, regularly making trips
away. Her safaris in search of native
art began 13 years ago in Africa when
she was living in Rhodesia. Her African
acquisitions were sold in a matter of
days when they went on exhibition in
London. Since then she has made ex-
peditions to the Middle East, Vietnam,
Greece, the Philippines and Thailand.
“But I cannot help being disappointed
with the art of many of these areas,
which have become too civilised for
my purposes,” she said.
A year ago she made her first trip to
West Irian and found much unspoiled
native culture along the route where
anthropologist Michael Rockefeller met
his death. Miss Taft said that she had
spoken to Europeans and natives on the
south coast of West Irian, near Merauke,
who last saw Rockefeller alive, and

plans to advance her own theory about
how he was killed in a book to be pub-
lished later this year. “1 feel we don’t
know the whole story yet,” she said.
Miss Taft said that her book will also
deal with her relationship with the
natives. “It will describe my own re-
action to them,” she said, “and the
affinity I have with them. I’m not
afraid of them. I am a woman on her
own and they only attack through fear.”
Miss Taft travelled in West Irian as
a guest of Garuda, the Indonesian Gov-
ernment airline company. She flew a
300-mile radius in military planes which
deliver food to installations in the area.
She has one vivid memory of Biak, once
an important international air terminal
the howling of dogs. “The Dutch had
left in such a hurry, they left their dogs
there,” she said.
A prize which Miss Taft acquired
from the Baining people is a 15-foot-
long fire dance shield, w'hich is now in
her Paddington shop. Anthropologists
believe that the people of Baining
migrated originally from Tasmania, via
Rabaul. “The fire dance is held once
every five years and we were lucky to
be on the spot,” Miss Taft said. “Several
natives carry the shield through the fire,
then it is abandoned and one man goes
into the fire alone. The shield, which
may have taken a year to make, is often
discarded or burnt.”
Persuading the natives to part with
their sacred objects was not always easy.
Miss Taft had ingeniously thought to
take a bag of tricks from a Sydney magic
shop. At Karoka, on the swampy part
of the Sepik, where the natives proved
unfriendly, a face-shield took her eye.
The natives would not sell. “I did every-
thing to persuade them to let me have it
I even cut the elders’ hair. But they
just said, ‘no go’. Finally, I decided to
do some magic myself. I had a trick
egg-cup and I could cut a rope and it
would still be in bne piece. I did my
tricks then told them I would make the
face-shield disappear if they wouldn’t iet
me buy it. They were convinced I could
work magic, so they sold it to me.
“The women were always curious
about what I wore. They got hold of
my brassiere once and made their own
out of twine. They copy everything.”
Once as she was going up the Sepik
River in a tiny canoe with two natives
and an array of accumulated art objects,
the boat’s engine stopped and defied all
attempts at repair. Two natives sitting
on the river bank pulled them in and,
as it was getting dark, Miss Taft settled
down on the bank for the night. That
evening she saw an unforgettable tech-
nique for catching crocodiles—by teasing
one out of the water with a human foot.
“I saw one of the natives with his
toe in the water,” she said. “I had
goose-pimples watching. He lifted his
foot out and I saw two red eyes about
two inches from it. Then he put his
toe back in. The night was very silent.
The foot came out again. All of a sudden
the crocodile’s whole head came out
after his foot. At that moment ... in
a split second ... the native speared it.
I was completely terrified. I saw the
native drag the crocodile out. It was not
quite dead. That ensures that the skin
is not damaged.”
Miss Taft plans to return to West Irian
in 2i months’ time before completing
her book. The money from the sale of
objects she collects on this next trip will
be used to help build an Indonesian
museum and expand the Indonesian
Institute for Anthropologists. The Gov-
ernment will cover all Miss Taft’s food
and travel expenses and provide a young
Indonesian anthropologist to accompany
her to the south-west coast.
“The average Indonesian is very kind
and hospitable,” said Miss Taft, whose
hosts in Djakarta insisted she forgo
hotels and stay in their homes.
“1 am mainly interested in prehistoric
man,” she said. “There are very few
areas where I can say that I have really
seen man born. In West Irian, where
there are no other influences—the Indo-
nesian programme for the natives has
not yet been implemented the art is
close to truth. It is art expressed with-
out fear.”


AROUND MELBOURNE
The Bonynge Affair
"I'm not going to twiddle my thumbs "
*T»he Richard Bonynges are living at
A No. 1 Tintern Avenue, Toorak.
It is owned by Peter Lynch, the
caterer, who is on a world tour. Peter
Lynch now personally runs Nine
Darling Street, the elegant old recep-
tion house where generations of
Toorakonians have had their wed-
dings, and 21st birthday parties.
His house in Tintern Avenue is a
white two-storey building, not very
pretentious. It has six bedrooms, large
lounge, dining room and, of course,
a grand piano. It is in a very well-
fed area, but purists would consider it
the wrong side of Toorak village, a
far martini from the Gloria Soames of
Albany Road and Heyington Place.
Living at No. 1 Tintern Avenue
are Joan Sutherland, Mr Bonynge, a
cook, two secretaries to Mr Bonynge
and a private secretary to Miss Suther-
land. All the week there have been
no Press interviews, no scoop appear-
ances on the best TV programmes, no
scoop arrivals at Toorak functions
with after-mentions in the social
columns. The only function was a
Mobil luncheon, a sentimental affair
for old friends from the Mobil Quest
days.
Meanwhile, the departure of John
Matheson has caused some tears at
J. C. Williamson’s. John McCallum
has said “We have four other con-
ductors apart from Mr Bonynge”.
But John Matheson was from Sadler’s
Wells, the man with the outstanding
qualifications. It was his photograph
that appeared on the advance pro-
gramme with all the stars. He said:
“It was an artistic agreement. Wild
horses won’t drag anything more out
of me. J. C. Williamson’s have been
absolutely marvellous about the con-
tract.”
JCW’s felt that, too. They brought
him out from England, sent him home
again, and paid 14 weeks’ salary with-
out getting one public performance.
What could they do? They could
have taken Mr Matheson to court.
But how do you argue differences cf
musical opinion before a judge? But
even more important, the company
was terrified at the prospect of
arguing anything in public which
might spoil Sir Frank Tait’s greatest
season since the days of Melba.
Mr Matheson was loyal to the end.
There was a goodly Press team at the
airport waiting to see him off. But
he said he had an agreement with
J. C. Williamson’s not to talk. “I’m
going home,” he said. “I came here
to play music, not to twiddle my
thumbs.”
There are many stories as to why
he resigned. One version is that
Richard Bonynge interrupted him in
the middle of a rehearsal and replaced
him with Gerald Krug, whereupon
Matheson resigned. It wasn’t as simple
as that. The break had been coming
for a long time after a series of minor
disagreements. JCW’s tried to placate
Matheson. He said he would stay, it
is said, on condition that there was
no more interference from Mr
Bonynge. But Mr Bonynge held all
the aces, he was the artistic director.
They couldn’t give such an assurance.
So Matheson went. Whereupon JCW’s
appointed another conductor, Mr
William Weibel. In the advance pub-
licity Mr Weibel was listed as a
“repetiteur”. (A repetiteur is a gentle-
man who repeats the conductor’s beat
for the chorus.)
But the man who took over im-
mediately from Matheson was the
chorus master Gerald Krug. He per-
formed on the opening night of
“Eugen Onegin”, which should have
been Matheson’s opening perform-
ance, and he took a mauling from the
critics. John Sinclair in “The Herald”
said: “Perhaps the most serious single
deficiency was Gerald Krug’s con-
ducting. In the first act every lyrical
element in the score withered under
his fiercely determined beat. The
orchestra was too loud for the singers
and the brass and the double basses
frequently obscured the valiant but
futile efforts the main body of strings
were making . .
All this is tough for JCW’s. The
great agony to date has been to build
up the non-Sutherland nights. It’s
like putting on Elizabeth Taylor and
Shirley Temple on alternate nights.
Miss Taylor gets all the publicity and
Miss Temple none. But, unless the
company can get capacity houses right
through, it stands to lose heavily.
It is called the Sutherland-William-
son-International Grand Opera Com-
pany, but the choice of operas un-
doubtedly was not left in the hands
of JCW’s. The operas which are per-
formed on the non-Sutherland nights
are good operas, performed by a
magnificent cast, the type we normally
get only once in a decade, but they
are not the operas Williamson’s would
have chosen. No Barber of Seville,
no Boheme, no Tosca. Instead there
are unfamiliar names like L’Elisire
d’Amore and Eugen Onegin.
Somehow the public, all around
Australia, has to be talked into these
operas. Ah, but it has been a lovely
week for Melbourne. The first night
of the opera, Lucia di Lammermoor,
was on the Saturday night, at a con-
servative estimate at least 600 new
gowns. The Lord Mayor’s Ball was
on the Wednesday night. On the
Wednesday, no doubt by tactful con-
tact between Town Hall and Her
Majesty’s, it was a non-opening night,
another performance of Luca Lucia.
So we had the same crowd at the
Town Hall as we had at Her
Majesty’s. Work out for yourself the
number of new gowns there.

the face of Email you know best
Such household names and brands as
Westinghouse, Electrice, Carmichael,
Eicon, Harford and Fyrside.
Yes, that is your Westinghouse refrig-
erator. And that is the range you plan
for your new home. Yes, your washer,
water-heater, television set, radio, fan,
your coffeemaker.
All these are products of Email. They
are well-known and demonstrate a
proud record of service and efficiency.
But the interesting thing is that they
are only one facet of the Email story.
Way and beyond the consumer products
activities that are demonstrated here
are the many Email interests that range
from power distribution apparatus to
automotive components. This wide
diversification of interests, that is so
typical of Email, works for Australia
in many ways. It means shared skills
and resources for each Email Division.
It offers financial stability and strength.
Here then is the promise and realisa-
tion of Email's policy—a policy of finer
products and continued growth.

OVERSEAS
Europe’s New Dark Era
What happened at Brussels
Cince the long night of June 30-July 1,
when the lights in the packed Brus-
sels conference room of the Common
Market accidentally but symbolically
w'ent out at 12.03 a.m., Europe has been
plunged into a new and darker era.
In hindsight, Market officials (“We are
upset. It is a stupid and pointless crisis”)
observed that trouble had been brewing
for some time. All year de Gaulle has
been dropping unsettling hints and un-
complimentary remarks about the Mar-
ket; at a recent garden party he called
the supra-nationalists “Jeans foutres ”
good-for-nothings. But the truth, as a
French official put it, is that “this crisis
was not foreseen, though easy to foresee.”
In the weeks before the fatal meeting
French officials had been gratifyingly co-
operative with the “Eurocrats” who run
the European Economic Commission.
On June 30 the session of the Council
of Ministers began equally well. The
chairman, French Foreign Minister
Couve de Murville, allowed the first part
of the debate to overrun by 45 minutes;
an unprecedented gesture by this glacial
stickler for punctuality. The Ministers
agreed with no great trouble on abolish-
ing industrial tariffs by mid-1967 and on
a timetable for agriculture the great
bugbear of the Common Market.
Unifying prices for all farm products
in all six countries is fantastically com-
plex. But the result is plain. France, with
Europe’s biggest food surpluses and low-
est farm prices, is bound to gain from the
levies on food imports and the other
five are bound to lose; a price they have
been willing to pay for industrial ad-
vantages and European unity.
The French, wizards at tortuous
Brussels bargaining, have always screwed
up this price as high as they could. This
time round, the Italians jibbed. As the
poorest member of the Six, Italy natu-
rally objects to paying a fat subsidy to
French farmers. By the black night of
June 30 Couve de Murville had agreed
that France should help the Italians out.
But the ambitious Italian Foreign Minis-
ter, Amintore Fanfani, smelt a rat. He
insisted on reviewing the arrangement
after two years. This was the point of
explosion.
To some extent, Couve was perfectly
within his rights. The Six were indeed
committed to reaching an agreement on
farm finance on June 30, extending until
1970. But “stopping the clock”—continu-
ing to negotiate a compromise after a
deadline has passed—is by now a Market
ritual. When Walter Hallstein, the pro-
fessorial German who is top Eurocrat,
again wanted to clock-stop, Couve gave
him an undiplomatic rebuff. At one
point he is supposed to have said, “Mr
Hallstein, you forget that there are Gov-
ernments involved.”
Was this a clue? Hallstein has become
persona non grata with the General both
as the symbol of a supra-national Europe
(said recently to have called himself
“Europe’s first Prime Minister”) and as
the man responsible for framing obnoxi-
ous, provocative supra - national pro-
posals. One of these, never really got to
grips with on June 30, was of overwhelm-
ing importance. Hallstein’s Commission
wanted to bring forward the start of the
agricultural Common Market to mid-
-1967. It proposed that then the vast an-
nual total of farm levies and customs
duties some 3000 million dollars
would come under the democratic con-
trol of the now-powerless European Par-
liament.
Brussels is convinced that compromise
on the specific farm finance issue was
(and is) possible. Everybody at the meet-
ing wanted desperately to continue
save Couve. Between 10.30 p.m. and
midnight the Frenchman put through a
telephone call to his master’s home, the
Elysee Palace. After that it was clear that
Couve, icy as usual, had decided to
break up the meeting.
Either France was not interested in a
compromise, which seems inexplicable,
or Couve was shrewdly forcing a breach
on the lesser issue, farm prices, to avoid
a confrontation on the crucial question,
supra-national control. This is also loom-
ing up in another form. From January
1 next year the Council of Ministers is
due to take big decisions, not unanim-
ously, but by simple majority.
Whatever the truth, French officials in
Paris seemed as taken aback by the
rupture as anybody else. Emerging from
the shattered meeting at 2 a.m. on July
1 to hold a Press conference, Couve, ac-
cording to an eye-witness, “was clearly
unhappy with his first failure.” The sur-
prised Frenchmen did not have to wait
long for guidance from on high. After
de Gaulle had held a Cabinet meeting
the same day, his Minister of Informa-
tion, Alain Peyrefitte, read out the Gen-
eral’s declaration with great care. It
bristled with dire threats; the EEC
would be boycotted and the Market, ac-
cording to Peyrefitte, was at “point
mort” —standstill.
It was a political crisis for France as
well as the Market. French farmers, the
most troublesome political lobby in
France and the chief beneficiaries of
Treaty of Rome, were appalled. Ever
since the Brussels breach their repre-
sentatives have been nagging at Edgar
Pisani, the bearded, Ustinov-like Agri-
cultural Minister.
French industry was equally aggra-
vated and anxious. Joint teams of in-
dustrial and Government planners at
work on the fifth economic plan, run-
ning from 1966 to 1970, are stymied.
The influential employers' association,
le Patronat, complained that “there
would be the gravest repercussions on
French industry if de Gaulle wrecked
the EEC.” On July 3 the keen, very
Gaullist Minister of Industry, Maurice-
Bokanowski, made a tough, funereal
speech; “a great French hope has died.”
The issue is basically the same. Gen-
eral de Gaulle is not interested in any
European solution which impairs French
leadership of Europe or which restricts
French liberty of action. Since the
Treaty of Rome conflicts with these fun-
damental Gaullist tenets, de Gaulle is at
war with the treaty and with its sworn
guardians—the Eurocrats.
The Europeans are still uncertain
whether, as in his veto of British entry,
de Gaulle is pursuing a calculated, sec-
retive course of action to achieve a final
solution. If he wants to destroy the
Common Market, he can; but the Gaullist
dream of French leadership in Europe
will also perish. If de Gaulle has chosen
this moment to stand on economic union,
with minimum political attachments, he
cannot be sure that the supra-national-
ists will not triumph after his own in-
evitable departure.
Very soon, perhaps at his threatened
Press conference, the General will show
his hand. Then Europe will learn wheth-
er, for the Common Market as envisaged
by its founders, this is the last crisis.

The Sun Still Never Sets
The British Empire’s 30 remaining colonies
From NOEL MOSTERT in London
One is almost surprised to find that
it still exists. But the Colonial
Office, established in the mid-nine-
teenth century to administer the pride
and profit of British dominion over
“palm and pine”, is still there, the
functioning heart of what is left of the
British Empire.
The empire is what Britain still owns
or protects or administers even though
the term “empire” itself has been dis-
carded and Whitehall now insists upon
the use of the phrase “British depen-
dencies”. These of course must never
be confused with the independent Com-
monwealth countries, whose relations
with Britain are handled by the Com-
monwealth Relations Office.
What Britain soon will be left with, in
the phrase of a BBC Reith Lecturer,
Margery Perham, will be “some small
and scattered ports and islands” that are
“in realistic terms . . . obligations rather
than assets”. By that she means terri-
tories too small to be viable in indepen-
dence. Having been told so long that
they are British, many of these tiny com-
munities now resolutely refuse to be any-
thing else. So that the Colonial Office,
with what one assumes to be a deep sigh
of loyal and maternal patience, must now
treat with the somewhat bizarre reverse
of the coin, an insistence from some
people that they don’t want to be free
at any price, that things are fine as they
are, thank you.
Otherwise the pace of emancipation
of former British dependencies has been
so swift in recent years that it has been
hard to keep track of what the empire
still consists of. At home, the British
generally have so entirely forgotten the
empire.
But when one enters it, the Colonial
Office itself seems the single place totally
unaffected by all this change and contra-
diction of imperial event. One comes
into a labyrinth of wide musty corridors,
resolutely led by an upright old retainer
in half-formal wear who indicates slightly
with his head or hand and never speaks.
As one walks past dim portraits of for-
gotten vice-regents and a painting of a
P &' O liner, long gone, the whole mood
a- I measured gravity of the place, its
very mustiness, gives one the feeling of
going back to an age solid, imperturb-
ably convinced, panelled in oak, and
ignorant of plastics.
What certainly must be different, how-
ever, is the gay informality, the charm-
ing diffidence, of one’s official informant
as he proudly and without a vestige of
regret catalogues imperial recession,
swinging impulsively in his chair to grab
the telephone and check a fact on the
Hong Kong lease. “Hello? Oh, good
morning, old chap. I say, how much do
we pay for Hong Kong? Nothing! Good
Lord, I was sure we did.”
One has a vague sense of discomfort,
of being caught out: perhaps one had
always thought of the British passing it
all up with a certain pained politeness,
understating their discomposure, and had
come here with a morbid interest in
the performance. But obviously nothing
could be more wrong. The pamphlets
on de-colonisation proffered by my
Colonial Office informant ring with the
same blithe conviction; the phrases are
resonantly affirmative. “The armies of
the Caliphs were driven out of Spain;
but they left us algebra. Roman law and
the Latin tongues are the monuments
and follies of the emperors. So it has
been with Caesar; so let it be with the
British . . . the test is in the results.
‘By their fruits ye shall know them’.”
Rome took a millennium to crumble
with a slow and reluctant and resound-
ing magnificence. But the biggest and
most widely dispersed empire of all,
embracing every continent, every hemi-
sphere, every sea, has been dismantled
gradually during the past eighteen years,
its truncated parts usually set loose with
no further ado than a sunset parade and
a salute taken by minor royalty. Since
1947 the British have withdrawn their
rule from 693 million people, thereby
creating twenty-one new nations.
At its peak the empire employed a
legion of British civil servants —viceroys
and jurists and policemen, commissioners
and clerks and teachers, botanists and
station masters and carpenters, who went
out with a sense of mission or for a
change of scene or because they weren’t
needed at home. Of these, about twenty
thousand were top administrators, not in-
cluding those in India and the Sudan,
which were separately administered.
The flow of returning colonialists in-
creased as the Union Jack was lowered.
Whitehall found itself loaded suddenly
with the varied skills of several dis-
possessed governments.
“The fact of the matter is that we had,
and have, an extraordinary pool of talent.
There’s never quite been anything like
it,” the Colonial Office man said.
“People who’ve worked in almost every
part of Africa and Asia, who speak every
dialect you can think of, accustomed to
running huge tracts of bush or planta-
tion. We’ve had to shop everywhere for
jobs for them. We got one man a
university post in the United States as
a lecturer in Swahili. We’ve sent teachers
to Bermuda and Canada. A farm
manager to Ethiopia. A cost accountant
to Germany. A tiger-hunter is selling
television sets. The Lord Chancellor’s
office helps with former chief justices,
I believe.”
Most of the colonialists have settled
down well in England. The women like
the supermarkets and the fact that they
don’t have to drive 50 miles to do their
shopping. For the majority the worst
aspects of the return are the loss of
tropical sunshine and, most of all, of
responsibility. “These are people who
are accustomed to running things,” the
Colonial Office man said.
“The big boys have all gone,” the
CO man said. But Britain retains about
30 dependencies. The combined popula-
tion of these totals nine million, nearly
half of which is accounted for by the
island colony of Hong Kong.
There remain several ticklish problems.
In fact, for an empire virtually at its
end and consisting of scattered ports and
islands and protectorates, there still is a
good deal of noise and excitement.
A great deal of it is in Aden, the
military base and enclave in a steamy
coastal pocket below the Red Sea. Britain
wants to weld Aden, which is a former
colony with a population of 220,000, into
a unitary State with the Federation of
South Arabia and those States within
the Protectorate of South Arabia not

already part of the Federation. “A for
Aden,” the Colonial Office man said.
“And it deserves no A’s. Anyway, in-
dependence by 1968. That’s the way it
is now.”
Islands too, even the most utopian
of them, can be troublesome. Or, per-
haps to be more specific, Indians can
be. Indian labor was a freely exportable
item in the nineteenth century; it was
pliable, fecund and willing. Among other
places, Indians were sent to Mauritius, a
tiny island in the Indian Ocean ceded fo
Britain by France in 1814, which is a
heavy producer of sugar. Indians were
also imported to Fiji. On both islands
they now outnumber the original in-
habitants.
The Indians have become the political
leaders and want independence, which
the minorities oppose, fearing complete
Indian domination.
“Difficult one to work out. You’ve
got to listen to the chaps who want to
be independent but you can’t ignore
those who don’t. Perhaps self-govern-
ment by next spring. Independence?
About 1968.”
The British withdrawal from Africa is
almost complete, although the final phase
is one of the most extraordinary. Aside
from Rhodesia, which has been semi-
independent for some time and threatens
complete independence any day and over
which Whitehall appears to declare itself
powerless, only three territories remain,
colonially speaking. These are Bechuana-
land, Swaziland, and Basutoland, and the
curious distinction they hold is of bring-
ing independent black Africa to the
borders of the Republic of South Africa
and even inside it.
Most disturbing for South Africa is
the future of Basutoland, an enclave in
the very heart of the country. A pro-
South African black government was re-
turned in recent elections to form a
pre-independence government. But a
Left-wing anti-South African and anti-
traditionalist party, the Basutoland'Con-
gress Party, won 25 of the 60 seats in
the national assembly. The next election
could well mean a Chinese embassy
inside South Africa a few hundred miles
from Johannesburg. Who has really
seriously considered the implications of
this? “Hmmm,” said the Colonial Office
man. “Hmmmm, well now; let’s look
at the rest of it, shall we?
“As you see,” he added, with a sigh
which seemed to be one of renewed sur-
prise. “It isn’t all over yet by any means.
“A for Antarctica. British Antarctica.
Just ice there, and, from what I last
heard, about a hundred scientists. Falk-
land Islands handles it. B for Bahamas,
and another B for Bermuda. Both
prosperous and quiet. Bahamas have
internal self-government, and Bermuda is
just jogging along as a colony. C for
Caribbean. We’re going to try another,
smaller federation there, the Leeward
and Windward Islands and Barbados.
Talks coming up later this year. Gibral-
tar. We’re hanging on to it, old chap.
Pitcairn Island? Nothing much there.
Still lots of people named Christian in
the administration. Tristan da Cunha.
The entire population came to England
after a volcanic eruption, but they didn’t
like it here so they went back, and I
can assure you there’s absolutely no
politics there whatsoever.”
There was a pause while one of the
solemn-faced old retainers served us
saucerless mugs of tea. “I say,” the CO
man said, sipping his cup appreciatively.
“You know what some of those people
call us? The sun setters! Jolly good
that, don’t you think? The funny thing
is that the British dependencies are so
scattered that the sun still doesn’t set on
them, if you know what I mean.”

SPACE
Making Mars
Pictures transmitted from Mars so far
*- have not yielded much information
about the possibility of life on Mars, but
they indicate that the planet has an
environment inhospitable to intelligent
life as known on Earth.
Initial findings disclosed: (1) Mars has
virtually no magnetic field, hence, presum-
ably, no liquid core, thus differing funda-
mentally from Earth in terrain features;
(2) Mars has no significant radiation belt.
This means space vehicles exploring the
planet can orbit for long periods without
radiation dangers to passengers or instru-
ments; (3) Mars has an extremely thin
atmosphere. The air pressure on the
planet’s surface is between 10 and 25
millibars, which is about two per cent of
sea-level barometric pressure on Earth.
The thin atmosphere could have signifi-
cant effect on explorations. Ordinary
parachutes, wings and other devices for
retarding descent will be useless. New
landing techniques, possibly involving
enormous nose-cones or balloons must
be developed. The thin air and the
absence of a magnetic umbrella mean
much more radiation reaches the surface
of Mars from space than strikes Earth.
The first pictures showed no clear
evidence of the famed canals which
would indicate the presence of intelligent
life, but scientists did not rule out their
existence. Dr Pickering, of the jet pro-
pulsion laboratory, Pasadena, California,
said, “I still believe we’ll find at least
simple forms of life on Mars. But in
order to do this we must land on the
planet.” American space engineers are
now developing a bigger and more
elaborate' spacecraft called Voyager
which will land instruments on Mars’
surface.
UNITED NATIONS
Lost Wit
fThiE late Adlai Stevenson once said he
would “rather not” be President. But
when the Democratic Party nomination
was thrust on him in 1952 Stevenson
accepted it with the pledge to “talk
sense to the American people, to tell
them there are no gains without pains,
that we are now on the eve of great
decisions, not easy decisions”. He did
so in his Presidential campaign, with so
much candor on sensitive topics that it
probably cost him votes. He campaigned
with wit as well. (“If the Republicans
stop telling lies about us we will stop
telling the truth about them.”)
He lost, possibly because he was too
urbane for the masses but mainly,
observers agreed, because war hero
General Eisenhower was a certainty.
Stevenson commented he felt like a little
boy in one of Abraham Lincoln’s stories
who stubbed his toe in the dark. “He
was too old to cry but it hurt too much
to laugh.” Nominated by the Demo-
crats again in 1955 and defeated by
Eisenhower by an even wider margin,
Stevenson told followers, “Be of good
cheer and remember that a wise man
said, ‘A merry heart doeth good like a
medicine, but a broken spirit dryeth the
bones’.”
Some Democrats wanted him as can-
didate once more in 1960. But he
vacillated until it was too late, and later
accepted from President Kennedy the
appointment as Ambassador to the
United Nations instead. There he spoke
for the United States gracefully, often
eloquently. Yet, almost from the outset,
there were reports that he was not com-
pletely happy with the job. He admitted
early this year, “I’ve sometimes been
a little restless in this role of executing
and articulating policies of others.”
According to the “New York Times”,
Stevenson talked privately to friends
about resigning the UN post. Some
gained the impression he was serving
more out of patriotism than conviction,
fearing that his resignation would be
interpreted as a disavowal of Johnson’s
policies, which could hurt the President
in his search for hard answers in Asia.
VIETNAM
Exit Taylor
are a number of reasons why
General Maxwell Taylor is vacating
the US Ambassadorship to South
Vietnam not the least of which is
that South Vietnamese leaders wanted
him replaced. Whether his successor,
Henry Cabot Lodge, will prove more
acceptable to - the military junta that
rules in Saigon today remains to be seen.
For public consumption, General
Taylor resigned “for personal reasons”.
In fact, he has compelling reasons for
returning to civilian life. He has served
his Government for all but two years
since he joined the army in 1918, at
the age of 17, and he wishes to be with
his wife, who is in indifferent health.
Maxwell Taylor came to Vietnam in
July, 1964, with a mandate from Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson to get the country
back on the track. He has accomplished
a great deal, but he has not completed
his assignment, and now he will not be
here to see the finish.
It is no secret that the young generals
now running the Government have little
affection for Taylor, and it is obvious
that Taylor regards the young generals
as young. When the generals were
given the task of forming the Gov-
ernment, it was common know-
ledge that the US embassy tried to pre-
vent General Nguyen Cao Ky, the Viet-
namese Air Force Commander, from
becoming, Prime Minister. The Ameri-
cans considered 34-year-old Ky too
young, too inexperienced, and too
impetuous. Ky got the Premiership, how-
ever, and he has not forgotten the US
opposition.
THE US
Color Politics
T\r Martin Luther Ktng, the Negro
leader in the American civil rights
movement, has given a public warning
that unless the Government does some-
thing to get the Vietnam war to the
conference table, he may lead his move-
ment to protest against the present
policy with public rallies and “teach-
ins”. “We are not going to defeat Com-
munism with bombs and guns and
gases,” he told 2000 wildly cheering
Negroes at Virginia Negro College. We
must negotiate even with the Vietcong.
I’m not going to sit by and see the war
escalated without saying anything about
it.”
Up to now the Negro leaders have
kept strictly to the problems of their
own race in the United States. But as
more and more of them register as
voters as a result of civil rights legisla-
tion they are beginning to realise their
potential power as a third force or pres-
sure group within the American system.

suspension of the Peruvian Con-

Government of Dr Fernando Belaunde

cause of the measure was a sharp
increase in pro-Communist guerrilla
activity in the mountainous province of

by the suspension of normal political
guarantees.

The irony of the situation is that this
violence has been launched under a
Government which, for almost the first
time in Peruvian history, is doing some
thing active to remove the grievances
against which the guerrilleros are pro-
testing, and which they claim in
general, and sometimes absurdly optimis-
tic, terms to be able to redress. The
guerrilleros, like the so-called Armed
Forces for National Liberation in
Venezuela, want revolution rather than
evolution, and say so daily in Quechua,
over their pirate radio station.
Cuba is the likely source of inspira-
tion if not of aid and indoctrina-
tion. In more sophisticated Latin-Ameri-
can countries, the appeal of Castro’s
Cuba has worn off, if only because life
in Cuba sounds and is so uncom-
fortable. But it is not nearly so uncom-
fortable as life in the Peruvian Andes.
ISRAEL
BG-Again
rpHE splitting of Israel’s ruling Mapai
(Labor) Party into rival groups led
by the present Prime Minister, Mr Levi
Eshkol, and the former Premier, Mr
David Ben Gurion, has touched off what
could be a long period of political in-
stability.
Since Israel was founded in 1948,
Mapai has dominated every coalition
government. At the moment Mr Eshkol’s
majority is only eight in a Knesset
(Parliament) total of 120 members. Mr
Ben Gurion has taken six members with
him, reducing Mr Eshkol’s majority to
two. There is no real ideological differ-
ence or disagreement about fundamental
policy between the two men. Both belong
to the middle-roaders of Israel’s non-
Marxist pragmatist Labor Party. On
foreign policy, the only discernible differ-
:e between the two camps is one
o! emphasis.
The real differences are personal
rather than doctrinal. Ben Gurion, the
lonely but strong visionary, stubborn and
unpredictable, appeals overwhelmingly to
the party’s younger leaders, to some im-
migrants from Oriental countries and to
all dissatisfied elements. Eshkol is practi-
cal, down-to-earth, adaptable and undog-
matic, ready to be a team-man. He has
become the focal point for Mapai’s tradi-
tional leadership, for numerous people in
and around the Establishment, and for
those who vote for whoever is in power.
A public opinion survey just submitted
to the Ben Gurion headquarters claims
that they would win 18 of Mapai’s 42
Knesset seats, were elections held today.
At the most, Eshkol circles concede Ben
Gurion between five and 10.


FORUM
The Politics of Wool
The heavy hand of the Country Party
By JOHN ANDREW
Considering its size and influence on
the Australian economy it is a
remarkable fact that the wool in-
dustry has, until the present time, re-
mained largely outside the mainstream of
Australian political life. True, it has
always been there in the background,
and it has at various times entered the
political arena. But, in the past, these
efforts have been indirect. The wool
interests have sponsored non-woolgrower
spokesmen and always what the wool-
grower interests have wanted has been
simplicity itself: keep your hands off and
leave us alone.
The great historical examples of
getting just this occurred in the 1830 s
when the squatters squatted on the land,
and in the 1860 s when the Land Acts
first tried to “unlock the land”. One
must admire the resourcefulness of the
founders of the wool industry. As well
as political assaults, they have ridden
out the droughts, the bank crashes, the
fires and the floods (or have gone broke
in the process). And they did it all on
their own feet.
In World War I and World War II the
industry accepted Government interven-
tion in the marketing of the wool clip
but in each case it dispensed with these
inroads just as soon as it could after
the wars.
Now, in 1965, if the reserve price
scheme is adopted, the industry will be-
come married . with government. The
Government (apart from the special
conditions of war-time) has been inter-
fering with the industry for some time
. now. To be exact, since 1951. That
was an important year.
In 1951 the woolgrowers voted over-
whelmingly to reject the Post JO system
of reserve price marketing which had
existed during the war, and the price of
wool on the free market reached the all-
time record high. But, despite the fact
that the war-time marketing system had
been rejected, the Government very
successfully interfered to freeze the
“cream off the top” of the proceeds
which woolgrowers believed belonged to
them. The freezing of the funds was
challenged in court and, no unusual thing
in Australia, the Government won.
Nothing has ever been quite the same
since. Nowhere is the change more in
evidence than in the almost incredible 45
to five vote by the Australian Wool In-
dustry Conference in Sydney a few weeks
ago in favor of the Wool Board’s reserve
price scheme. The conference represents
both large growers and small growers
and it is so constituted that, in general
terms, the large growers have 25 votes
and the small growers 25 votes. But is
it truly representative of growers? It is
an appointed body, not an elected one.
The two major organisations, the Aus-
tralian Woolgrowers and Graziers’
Council and the Australian Wool and
Meat Producers’ Federation, appoint 25
delegates each.
On a truly democratic basis the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference would
be an elected body on a regional or
electoral college system. But, and this
is the point, were this the case, the dis-
tinct possibility is that the larger wool-
growers would get even less of a say
than they have now.
It can be argued that, in view of the
size of its industry, NSW deserves
more than 12 seats on the Wool Industry
Conference. But again, were an electoral
college system introduced, the chances
are that most of the NSW seats would
“An insularity which at times
amounts to arrogance ”
be occupied by the smaller growers of
the Australian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation. And these men are whole-
heartedly behind reserve price.
Clearly dissatisfied with the changed
attitude of the Graziers’, a group has now
been formed in NSW to fight the reserve
price proposal called the Committee for
the Retention and Improvement of the
Free Wool Market. It is headed, most
appropriately, by Mr R. W. Macarthur-
Onslow, a descendant of lohn Macarthur
who did not have much time for govern-
ment interference in his industry either.
And it will require the sort of tenacity
which lohn Macarthur himself possessed
to enable this new committee to make
the necessary headway. The run has
been left late. It should have been
formed three years ago —or earlier
when all the other committees in favor
of reserve price were being formed.
Private buying is one crux of the
matter. Private buying, or treaty arrange-
ments, have always existed in the wool
industry. The reason some woolgrowers
have always been prepared to sell
privately is that this gives them quick
cash. The reserve price scheme does
not, in so many words, do away with
private buying, but quite obviously the
scheme will reduce the incentive on the
part of growers to sell privately. In
both South Africa and New Zealand,
where reserve price systems exist, the
experience has been that private buying
has withered and finally died out.
Now if enough uncommitted growers
dislike the notion of private buying dis-
appearing, then this new committee could
make headway.
The uncommitted grower, and private
buying, are the keys. The view of the
committed growers has been expressed
by the Wool Industry Conference. The
two major organisations which make up
the Wool Industry Conference have, to-
gether, perhaps 60,000 of Australia’s
120,000 woolgrowers. There are prob-
ably 40,000 belonging to no organisation
at all and obviously this would be enough
to be a powerful voting factor. Then
there are the 20,000 approximately who
belong to the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union.
The recent Wool Industry Conference
rejected, for the third time, an applica-
tion for membership from the APPU.
The APPU is understandably bitter. The
Wool Industry Conference rejected the
APPU for a very obvious reason: it
wants no part of a group able to swing
the balance of power within the con-
ference.
Yet any hope of a merging of forces
between the APPU and the Macarthur-
Onslow committee (these hopes were
always pretty slim) was dashed at the
recent special meeting of the wool section
of the Victorian APPU in Melbourne.
The meeting was addressed by both Sir
William Gunn and Mr Macarthur-On-
slow. After hearing both speakers the
meeting decided by 59 to 37 to support
the reserve price at the referendum.
What the Victorian wool section of the
APPU decides, of course, need not neces-
sarily go for the APPU federally. But the
organisation is strongest in Victoria, by
a long way, and it can be taken for
granted that the Melbourne decision is a
fair reflection of likely APPU attitudes at
the referendum.

Two further decisions of the Wool In-
dustry Conference can only further
strengthen the Reservists. The conference
rejected a suggestion that some form of
plural voting related to production be
used in the referendum of growers. This
means one-man one-vote. It also re-
jected a suggestion that a majority of
60 per cent be necessary to implement
any change in marketing. Therefore a
simple majority stands. Sir William
Gunn has defined simple majority as 51
per cent.
The speech of the Minister for Prim-
ary Industry, Mr Adermann, prior to
the conference also left little doubt that
the Commonwealth Government expects
the referendum to be carried and reserve
price implemented. So when the un-
committed grower votes he will do so
with a pretty clear idea that the Wool
Board wants the reserve price, that the
Commonwealth Government wants it,
and that the Wool Industry Conference
wants it.
HThe one remaining group which might
-*■ sway him, the brokers, are still not
telling him how to vote and at' this stage
one can only assume that they are pre-
pared to let him vote as he sees fit. When
one talks of brokers, one needs to qualify
this. Two brokers dominate all others
and, because of their sheer size, dominate
the National Council of Wool-Selling
Brokers. These are Dalgety and New
Zealand Loan (English) and Elder Smith
Goldsbrough Mort (Australian). Between
them they account for over half the clip
and their share will probably grow
bigger, not smaller. Outside these two
giants there are some seven or eight
minor*firms and some of these are very
efficient brokers. But the point is the
size °f these two. If a broking lead is
t 0 come it must be from one, or both,
of these two firms. Their attitude has
been stated. It is that they will keep out
an d will let the growers decide for them-
selves.
The reason these two firms are no
longer interested in getting involved
in the reserve price dispute (although
some smaller brokers are) may never
be stated. A good guess may be
that it is tied up with the traditional
service the broker gives in lending money
to woolgrowers. The broker cannot lend
this money at much more than one per
cent above bank rates. And this is the
hire-purchase age! It may be yet proved
wrong, but, should the reserve price
scheme come in, it would not be surpris-
ing at all to see the lending activities
of the brokers decrease and those of
the Reserve Bank increase. Sir William
Gunn is, after all, on the board of the
Reserve Bank.
Another factor influencing the big
brokers would be private selling. The big
brokers, unlike some smaller ones, can-
not feel too comfortable about the in-
crease in nrivate selling that has been
going on over recent years with up to
possibly 10 per cent of the total clip
being disposed of in this way.
It must be pretty obvious that there
is more to the recent AWIC 45 to five
vote than simply reserve price marketing.
There is. The big stick which has
resulted in the powerful coalition of
diverse woolgrowing interests is not Sir
William Gunn who is, in my opinion,
only the instrument. It is the Country
Party.
This is why the marriage between the
wool industry and Government would
stick. While the Labor Party has gone
from bad to worse in rural areas, and
while the Liberal Party has largely
ignored warning signs and has dithered
and dickered over such vital issues
as decentralisation and transport, the
Country Party has been consolidating its
already strong position in rural Australia.
It has young members and it feels it is
going places. Sir William Gunn is not
the only string to the Country Party
bow. It should be looked at and its
growing power should be recognised. It
has many admirable qualities and one
grave shortcoming an insularity which
at times amounts to arrogance. The rest
of us just do not count.
Strangely, the best argument against
the reserve price scheme does not seem
to have been used by anyone in the wooL
industry. This is what it could cost the
country, and the taxpayer, which in-
cludes this writer along with about 90
per cent of the population. Woolgrowers
argue amongst themselves over private
selling, over brokerage fees, over interest
rates, and over many other aspects of
the reserve price plan. Even the Reservists
seem afflicted with a degree of insularity
they want their hands on and other
people’s hands off.
They may get what they want but
just why should the average city wage-
earner have to help pay for it?

SIR. I don’t think I follow Mr Haw-

view that marihuana is dangerous be-
cause it might be the possible first step
towards narcotic addiction. He seems
to ignore the blunt fact that the “mis-
leading inclusion of marihuana in the
list of addictive and dangerous drugs”
does tend to restrict its use. And restrict-
ing the use of this admittedly delightful
and non-habit-forming drug almost cer-
tainly lowers the number of ex-mari-

SlR.—Batman’s article on Sunday enter-

draw your attention to the situation in
South Australia. The law-makers of this
State must already consider Sydney,
even without Sunday movies, a real cess-
pool of corruption with all their various
existing attractions. No organised enter-
tainment for which an admission is
charged is permitted in South Australia,
even if a percentage of the proceeds is
given to charity. The main entertain-
ment in Adelaide on Sunday afternoons
is a visit to the (already overcrowded)
airport to watch the ’planes come in!
It was hoped that the new Labor Gov-
ernment might have been inclined to
“liberalise” some of the well-intentioned
but completely outmoded puritanical
laws that for so long (in the opinion of
the minority) have protected the public
from itself. No modification of the pres-
ent intolerable situation has yet been
foreshadowed by a Government already
vociferous in its promises for the future.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
In Flight from the
Instant Berensons
From JAMES MURRAY in London
Pmnter William Drew looked at h ; s
pint of English beer as if he
wished he could dive into its
cloudy depths to escape from explaining
why, despite overtures from modish Lon-
don galleries, he has insisted upon air-
freighting to Australia the first major
collection of his European and North
African paintings. To anyone who knows
of the power exercised by London in
today’s art world, the decision at first
sight might seem foolhardy.
Certainly, Drew gave the impression
that he would rather analyse the ingredi-
ents of his lunchtime pub-sausage than
chew over his motives. Yet he contrived
to make it clear that sending 40 paintings
13,000 miles to Melbourne, when
galleries not an action painter’s throw
from his Kensington studio are eager f o
offer him exhibition facilities, was not
just an expatriate’s brainstorm.
Undoubtedly he fears the quick,
color-supplement success with the sub-
sequent dentist’s waiting-room oblivion
which attends so many painters in
England today as art-editors, hungry for
something to staple in with the full-page
advertisements, become instant Beren-
sons. In this atmosphere a premium is
placed upon technical showiness, upon
developments which might almost have
been named monosyllabically oop, op
or what-have-you-so as not to interfere
with the mastication of cocktail onions.
Fear of this kind of success by publicity
had made Drew sidestep all image-
building, including a skilful effort to
turn him into a tame portrait painter
for Zsa Zsa Gabor. “She'd probably have
had me tattooed to match the upholstery
of her Rolls-Royce.” Thus Drew dis-
misses an operation mounted by one of
the most subtle public relations men in
Britain, an operation carried out in the
high-powered ambience of television
studios and swank hotels.
Perhaps because he is the quietest of
Australians, Drew appears to attract
those who earn their crust by flamboy-
ance. Another public relations man
tried to persuade him to allow wealthy
Susan Wilding to arrange a show for
him at her fashionable West End
gallery.
These overtures from the fashionable
world provide a clue to the great danger
Drew faces as an artist: the sheer chant!
of his work. It is a danger he is deter-
mined to eliminate. As a by-product of
this determination to damn the charm,
Drew has enjoyed the occasional
Kerouac passage since he left Australia
in 1963, behind him his wife and two
children and a series of 30 paintings on
the journeyings of Marco Polo, in front
of him his first journey outside Australia.
In Rome Drew savored la dolce vita
than which no life is harsher; m Tangiers
he tried pot. In Paris he took the
traditional Left Bank studio but found
everyone painting by numbers and went
to live on the banks of the Seine where
he shared the cuisine of French artist
Armand Campi and his wife who lived
on rabbits supplied free by a clinic which
used them (the rabbits be it said) in
pregnancy tests. Drew’s own sketch of
this episode, with its winsome rabbit,
demonstrates something of the charm
which he was attempting to suppress by
roughing it.
The truth is, of course, that no one
could ever call this painter “Drew
Agonistes”. When he left Australia at
the age of 35 he had had four years of
formal training at what is now the Royal
Institute of Technology. He had been
an art teacher (“It seemed worthwhile”).
He had worked in an advertising agency
(“They came to me. I didn’t go to
them”). His market in Australia was
assured. It was he who was doubtful of
the validity of his success.
Paradoxically, however, it is out of
just such experiences as those outlined
above, smacking of an American Express
how-to-be-a-rea 1-live-artist kit, that Drew
has come to a new understanding of
himself and acceptance of his talent: the
charm is still there but as a birthmark
which, like Degas, Drew realises he must
bear rather than a dimple he displays.
This is clear in the sustained intensity
of the 40 pictures which came out of
his travels in southern Spain and
Morocco. Together with Drew’s other
European work, they will be on show for
the first time in Australia at an exhibition
which opens at the Leveson Street
gallery, Melbourne, on August 1 The
exhibition is evidence of how much Drew
feels that wherever the ultimate judg-
ments on his works may come from,
the first opinions that he values are
those of people who have a certain
continuum of knowledge of his develop-
ment as a painter.
Cynics may dismiss this as dinkum
chauvinism: Drew prefers to think that
an artist is provincial not so much in
the degree to which he is attached to his

birthplace but in the degree to which he
tends to overvalue the importance of
judgments from elsewhere. Again it
would be possible to dismiss this as a
piece of instant wisdom—if Drew had
not demonstrated his willingness to live

meeting with Sir John Rothenstein, the
former director of the Tate Gallery and
an arbiter of consequence if ever there
was one.
In the Theatre it is a
Matter of Money
By PATRICK TENNISON
After 51 months’ world touring
Israel, Greece, England, Canada,
the United States and New Zealand
all theatre man John Sumner seems able
to talk about on his return to Mel-
bourne is money—that is, subsidies for
theatres.
“No, really, the major impact of my
tour was the fact that enormous sums
are now being spent everywhere sub-
sidising live theatre,” he said. As ad-
ministrator of Melbourne’s Union
Theatre Repertory Company and Vic-
torian Director of Drama for the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust, he went abroad to
see plays, play people and to check on
how similar-minded organisations were
faring elsewhere. He has brought back
big, detailed comparison sheets of what
“they” are doing compared with the best
that “we” seem able to do.
“Now Birmingham Rep. is a good
example as far as Melbourne is con-
cerned,” he said. “The city has li mil-
lion people and it operates in a 464-
seat theatre. Here in Melbourne we have
a larger population but alternate be-
tween the 500-seat Union Theatre and
400-seat Russell Street Theatre.
“Last year Birmingham Rep. got a
£17,000 sterling subsidy from the Brit-
ish Arts Council plus £7OOO sterling
from the local city council, £24,000
sterling a year altogether. Here in Mel-
bourne for a similar operation we get
a subsidy of between £BOOO and £lO,OOO
a year from the Trust and Melbourne
University.”
So, has theatre always got to be sub-
sidised? Mr Sumner’s point is that with-
out help financially Australian repertory
companies suffer several disadvantages.
Big-cast shows are almost impossible be-
cause it’s dicey whether money outlaid
will be returned. Birmingham Rep. can
do big-cast plays like Shakespeare’s “The
Winter’s Tale” and Shaw's “Heartbreak
House” fearlessly. Australian profes-
sional rep. companies usually can’t.
Also, financially flush companies can-
afford to have larger companies of play-
ers to draw on. The result is consistent-
ly high standards against Australia’s
chancy standards because here usually
people of varying abilities have to be
drawn on. Then there are inhibitions in
things like research into interpretations,
full and proper rehearsals, scenery and
the whole aspect of preparatory time for
a big play.
Not that the Union doesn’t get by.
“Financially we cover a pretty high per-
centage of-our costs about 90 per
cent, in fact,” Mr Sumner said. “But
it means that we have to play to the
gallery a bit. I’m not advocating pre-
senting theatre that is out of touch,
but there’s a hell of a lot we can’t pre-
sent because it’s too expensive; things
like ‘The Caucasian Chalk Circle’, some
of Shakespeare’s plays that, done well,
can be very thrilling; some Chekhov and
some Arthur Miller.
“ ‘The Caucasian Chalk Circle’, for in-
stance, really needs six weeks’ rehearsal
and backgrounding. It’s enormous. We
just can’t afford to do it. I know they
did it at the Old Tote in Sydney but it
lost money.”
After money, what impressed him
most particularly in England was
the way theatres in the non-London
areas were being promoted as part of a
city’s tourist and public amenities fea-
tures. Today they rank with a city’s art
gallery and public library as something
to take pride in. New theatres particu-
larly, such as the Belgrade in Coventry,
the Nottingham Playhouse and at Guild-
ford were really active centres of re-
laxation with restaurants and coffee bars
operating day and night, making them
meeting points and focal places.
One innovation he would like to
translate here is the growing use of voice
coaches working permanently with com-
panies.
But meantime he is back in the busi-
ness of preparing for the opening of the
Union’s 1965 Festival of New Plays to
be launched on September 6, back with
the problems of casting from compara-
tively small fields, always-brief rehearsal
times, and all the rest of the Australian
pattern.
OPERA
Offerings of Port
and Champagne
L’Elisire d’Amore. Donizetti.
Eugen Onegin. Tchaikovsky. Her Majesty's,
Melbourne.
The second and third offerings of the
Sutherland-Williamson opera season are
as different as port and champagne. The
first, “Eugen Onegin”, was not the wisest
choice as a cheap non-Sutherland stopi-
gap. Donizetti's “L’Elisire d'Amore”, on
the other hand, is an inspired choice.
It is an operatic comedy which not only
sparkles, but also provides superb oppor-
tunities for virtuoso singing. The aria
“Una Furtiva Lagrima” is justly famed
and, when sung as in Melbourne last
Thursday, should linger for years with
all who hear it.
“L’Elisire d’Amore” is in its way as
good, and certainly more wholesome,
than the composer’s more often heard
“Don Pasquale”. Its hero is a village
simpleton who falls for the wiles of a
quack and sells himself into the army
to pay for the love potion which will
win him the girl. Last week s first Aus-
tralian production of this romp was so
exceptionally fine in every way that it is
hard to know where to place the credit.
For the first time this season the orches-
tra, conducted by William Weibel, really
excelled and showed what playing it can
produce when properly handled. The


producer, Martin Scheepers, kept the
thin plot boiling with inumerable
felicitous touches. Tonina Dorati pro-
duced appropriately sunny sets and
costumes. But none of these would have
succeeded without what can only be
described as an inspired, almost faultless
cast.
The Nemorino of Luciano Pavarotti
was. world-class by any standard. This
performance could hold its own at La
Scala or the Metropolitan without any
doubt. Pavarotti is that rare thing, a
lyric tenor with volume and, even rarer,
he is an accomplished actor who never
steps out of the convincing character he
creates, and what a delightful and amus-
ing creation this Nemorino is. Elizabeth
Harwood acted equally well and sang
with taste and musicianship, using a fine,
though small, voice with pleasing effect.
Her voice did give out once or twice,
but this seemed due to some temporary
indisposition and not to any fault in her
voice production, which is unusually even
and covers the full soprano range with
ease.
The two buffo roles were almost of
the same high standard, Spiro Malas’
Dulcamara being quite brilliant. Robert
Allman was unusually sprightly as the
sergeant, though his voice does show
dangerous signs of an incipient tremolo.
Even Doris Yarick, in an insignificant
part, made her presence felt. The chorus
sang and acted with tremendous verve.
Tchaikovsky was not, of course,
mainly a symphonic composer but spent
his life trying to write the perfect opera
without success. “Eugen Onegin”
abounds in beautifully interwoven
themes, with the occasional sweeping
melody thrown in for good measure.
But the absence of great dramatic cli-
maxes, which one might reasonably have
expected from this composer, leaves only
a delicate fabric of drifting lines which
lead exactly nowhere, no matter how
pleasant the going may be. Perhaps the
music mirrors too closely Pushkin’s
insipid tale of the rake who spurns a
young girl’s love, only to have the tables
turned on him when he succumbs to
the charms of the same girl grown into
a sophisticated woman.
If it is possible to ruin a production
solely by means of poor scenery, this
must be the one. Fortunately, there are
compensations, but the very first scene
plunges the audience into depressing
anticipation of worse things to come.
Not only grows there no single flower
in Madame Larina’s garden, but it is
barrenly set in a thick birch-forest. This
is obviously the Cinderella of the season
with all expense spared.
"You're not a Jew and you're not a Catholic. What are you
then? A dilettante?"
Fortunately, the dismal scene is
peopled by fine singers. Margreta
Elkins makes a valiant try (her first?) at
Tatyana. In excellent voice, she sang
magnificently but achieved feeling only
in the last scene. Richard Cross (Onegin)
showed fine presence, looks and figure,
plus a warm voice. What a pleasure it
is to hear a true pianissimo from a
baritone! In other parts, Lauris
Elms displayed a rich contralto with
fine effect, while Monica Sinclair hid
an equally good voice behind some hid-
eous make-up. Joseph Rouleau was not
at his best as Gremin, but will
undoubtedly improve. Joseph Ward
made quite a hit in Triquet's unnecessary
solo.
I shall gloss over the failings of the
orchestra, in view of the shake-up among
conductors, which must have been
unsettling for all concerned.

The Afternoon” he certainly showed
some talent; it was a neat, unpretentious
Western, greatly helped by an inventive
script and good performances.
But “Major Dundee” is flatulent,
pompous and almost uncannily unin-
teresting. It seems that, towards the end
of the filming, Charlton Heston, who
stars as the gallant, boring Major, waived
his salary so that Peckinpah could afford
to make extra scenes. He should have
hung on to his money; the artistic im-
provement gained can have been
infinitesimal.
Apparently based on an incident of
American history, the film tells how
Major Dundee, commandant of a
military prison, sets off with a job-lot
of volunteers to put down a recalcitrant
Apache chieftain. Off they march, to
a relentlessly rhythmical musical score
and a song the lyrics of which run:
Fall in behind the Major!
Fall in behind the Major!
Fall in behind the Major!
(etc., etc.)
Peckinpah accompanies this sprawling,
muddled film with a narration from the
field-diary of the bugler-boy, possibly an
authentic document; but the young man
has little talent as prose stylist or
psychologist, and his contributions never

Dundee’s decision proved to be correct”
or “I fear many of our wounded will

Purporting to be a history of the treat-
ment of sex in films, “The Love God-
desses” has nothing very profound to say
in the matter, but it’s an entertaining
collection of clips showing the changing
fashions in the popular concepts of
female beauty and attraction.
It has the limitation common to most
such compilations that the makers
didn’t have access to all the required
material; for instance, Garbo is shown,
chubby and smiling, in an early Swedish
comedy, but her later emergence from
the chrysalis is passed over with a couple
of stills from “Queen Christina”. Simi-
larly, Marilyn Monroe is shown in “Clash
By Night”, an early, atypical film, and
the rest of her career covered (quite
cleverly, I’ll admit) by stills.
But there’s much fascinating material
here—famous vamps like Theda Bara,
Nita Naldi and Lya de Putti; Dietrich in
full male evening dress or even a gorilla
suit; Mae West singing “Sister Honky-
Tonk”; and some early scenes from
movie orgies that really look as if they
mean business.

TELEVISION
Stabbing Hard
Television has one important fact in
credit when compared with other media.
The several channels are not deterred,
as the popular magazines are, when one
of them has covered a particular subject.
This may be because there are a limited
number of matters suitable to the kind
of documentary and news feature now
televised. Chances of duplication are
considerable. But the fact remains,
whatever the reason. Matters which
need to be publicised, over and over,
until people realise their relevance, get
that treatment from television.
It would be a fair bet that before
1960 few Australians knew anything
about the Aborigines, and fewer cared.
Even the school books mention them
briefly and vaguely to this day. Anyone
who has watched a moderate amount of
television will have at least a slight know-
ledge. When the average person becomes
capable of saying, “I didn’t know the
Aborigines did this or that,” something
useful has happened and the source of the
stimulus is beyond doubt.
Television seems to stab hard enough
to wake people up. Personally, I have
been more affected by recent TV film
than by recollections of a blighted
Aboriginal camp on the Hawkesbury 30
years ago, the depressed and debased
state of the “boys” and “Marys” in the
Territory 20 years ago, and the eviction
of several families from a traditional
camp site in Brisbane four years ago.
These were unfortunate things, but —.
Now that the television cameras have
shown the facts, the Aborigines’ cause
no longer seems a hopeless one.
During National Aborigines’ Week it
was logical that some channels would
show topical film. ABC Television was
one of the first to do so, with Cecil
Holmes’ documentary, “Faces in the
Sun”, filmed in Arnhem Land for the
Australian Inland Mission. It was a good
film, deserving its Australian awards, but
necessarily limited by its Mission view-
point. In a recent British series, David
Attenborough’s camera looked at bush
and mission Aborigines, deeper in
Arnhem Land, with a more discerning
lens. Holmes’ magic was in scenes which
caught the wonder of going from the
bush into Darwin’s bright night lights.
Now if only someone would commission
him to make a film showing the real life
on the outskirts of town.
The two older commercial channels,
having looked closely at the subject
much earlier, were satisfied to cover the
week’s activities in news programmes.
The new channel, TEN in Sydney, in-
cluded a very effective, and affecting,
look at the city’s Aborigines in its regular
Sunday feature, “Walk a Young World”.
While sorrowing a little in a segment
using voice over scenes of the La Perouse
Aborigines, the feature also showed us
the ones who had proved that the times
are a-changing and it is now possible
for yesterday’s “blackfellow” to be to-
day’s jockey, student, fashion model,
singer and so on.
At La Perouse, as in the country,
homes are the need. Looking at the
accommodation many of the families
have to take in the city, it is easy to
understand why the La Perouse people
would rather stay there and hope for
one of the homes being built there.
Holmes expressed this hunger for home
in “Faces in the Sun”. It was also shown
in a “Seven Days” programme a few
weeks ago. In this way, television ex-
plodes comfortable “they’re happy as
they are” theories and creates pressures
which must go to the hearts of people
and to the Government hands which hold
the purse strings.

ing from a Vietnam speech by the
British Foreign Secretary, Mr Michael
Stewart. Mr Stewart was the outstanding
personality at the Oxford “Teach In”
debate, televised by the BBC and shown
in the ABC series, “Impact”. “Impact”
came 20 minutes after the Press
conference.
The two programmes invited compari-
son both for the way they were handled
and the television personalities of Sir
Robert and Mr Stewart.
The Canberra Press conference gets
worse every year. It is not only poor
journalism but bad television. It seems
surprising that the Prime Minister’s
advisers do not make better use of Sir
Robert’s ready-made television presence
by insisting that his opening statement
be cut by two thirds.
Mr Harold Holt, who, with the off-
camera Mr Paul Hasluck, flanked Sir
Robert (“Would that be right, Paul?”
“What do you think of that, Harold?”)
offered some distraction as he dozed
fitfully. But, even so, a telecast with
only two cameras to give two basic
pictures close-up and wide-shot
needs more than that if one person
wants to hold the screen, talking, for
very long.
A Parliament House built as tem-
porary premises in pre-television days
may be the real culprit but the present
room looks cramped. If it must be used,
then some effort has to be made to
get another camera in somewhere, so
that occasionally we might see more
than the balding heads of journalists.
But viewers can be grateful for one
thing. Television showed them not only
a past-master at answering questions
in precisely his own terms but a Press
gallery incapable of asking, or reluctant
to ask, vital and informed questions.
Where else would the cream of the
nation’s Press ask questions like “How
far do we go in the situation in Viet-
nam? America is a very big country.
We are a very small country. We follow
the line but where is it drawn, where
does it stop?” and get an answer like
“Well, we start off by trying to win.”
This was followed by another question,
“Yes, and where do we go from there?”
and another answer like, “Yes, well,
let’s win first.” Then awkward silence
followed by polite laughter, and on to
something else.
The “Teach-in” was the first oppor-
tunity to get a good look at Mr Stewart,
who deserved the praise he got from
the BBC commentator and more. Not
only for the reasoned, enlightened and
humane exposition of his case for sup-
porting American policy over Vietnam
and pressing for negotiations, but for his
ability to handle television. In his case
it was the simplicity of his expression,
the care and thought which had gone
into his speech and his ability to think
quickly on his feet.
No one who saw the programme will
forget the intelligent camera work which
showed us not only the questioners but
the embarrassed gratitude on the face
of America’s Henry Cabot Lodge, who
had earlier performed weakly, as he sat
listening to Mr Stewart pull American
chestnuts out of the Vietnam fire.
SAM LIPSKI
MUSIC
Strings as Song
The Vienna Octet. Sydney Town Hall.
Schubert’s short life represented a pre-
occupation with the possibilities of vocal
melody, and his instrumental music gives
evidence of an unending search for the
fusion of these vocal elements with the
particular properties of the strings and
wind. The six movements of the F Major
Octet explore such a musical assimila-
tion, and in performance it became
obvious that the members of the Vienna
Octet were conscious of this aspect of the
work. Phrases were treated as the pro-
gressive lines of a song, and the use of
a “luft-pause” between short sections
added to the effectiveness of this treat-
ment.
Schubert's music is inextricably bound
with the folk music traditions of early
19th-century Austria. Whether it was
in the dying sighs of the Andante, or
in the rollicking, openly colloquial
Allegro Vivace, the octet displayed a
consistent and natural affinity with the
musical idiom. By employing an
unusually wide vibrato in the strings,
coupled with that typically central Euro-
pean tendency for prolonging the second
beat in triple time, the players managed
to infuse into the music a warmth and
vitality which was recognisably Viennese.
In the same vein, the Minuetto was
presented with a touching romanticism.
Mysterious thunderings from the
'cello and bass introduce the slow sec-
tion which opens the final movement.
This tension is, however, soon relieved
by the jaunty theme of the Allegro,
and through a series of elaborations and
repetitions, the music surges forward,
only to be barred from its final release
by a recapitulation of the sombre
Andante which commenced the move-
ment. Within this framework, the octet
created a completely moving drama.
Each return of the principal subject is
heralded by a stark ostinato figure on
the viola, and by increasing the urgency
of these entries, the violinist Breitenbach
enabled the music to move towards a
shatteringly convincing climax. Here was
constructive interpretation at its best.

It may surprise you to know that many of the prize-winning stud rams and
ewes in the show ring owe at least part of their good looks to the efficiency
of A.A. grinding wheels. Under normal feeding conditions the abrasive
action of grit and gravel keeps sheep's teeth short, but the teeth of pen fed
stud sheep grow long very quickly. A simple grinding technique using
A.A. Wheels performs the necessary dentistry quickly and easily:
The scope of grinding operations is enormous and growing every day.

forces available is a practice as common
as it is unjustified. In an attempt, one
presumes, to expand their repertoire,
the Vienna Octet have unfortunately
indulged in this form of musical
adaptation. Perhaps one could accept the
substitution of a bassoon for Mozart’s
second horn part in the Divertimento
No. 10, but the addition of a ’cello is
indefensible. As expected, the resultant
texture was far too dense and muddy
for the work’s delicate chromaticism,
and much of the martial nature expressed
in the opening and closing Allegros was
lost to the smoother and inappropriate
tone of the bassoon.

Those who have always been told that
Haydn attempted almost anything ex-

to hear Haydn’s Three Organ Concertos
played by E. Power Biggs. In his cover
notes, H. C. Robbins Landon explains
that Haydn kept a kind of running the-
matic catalogue, the “Entwurf Cata-
logue”, and that on one of its pages was
written, in Haydn’s own hand, the theme
of the beginning of the Organ Concerto
No. 1 in C, listed both_as “per l’organo”
and “per il clavicembalo”.
Most contemporary pieces (1756)
were written for clavicembalo (harp-
sichord). References to the other two
concertos were on the next page of the
catalogue. Landon edited one which was
published a few years ago and the third
was discovered by Landon at Brno and
simultaneously at Marburg an der Lahn
by Horst Heussner and subsequently pub-
lished.
The recent reappearance of Horo-
witz in public coincides wonderfully
with Horowitz’s splendid Scarlatti record.
He plays a selection of 12 of the 550 son-
atas which have been culled from Dom-
enico Scarlatti's 53 harpsichord pieces
which he called “Essercizi”.
George London as Boris Godounoff-
is rather uncanny in four scenes of the
opera, “Boris Godounoff”, not just be-
cause of his masterly interpretation of
Moussorgsky’s barely disciplined power
and passion but because he sings in the
most authentic-sounding Russian.

BOOKS
The Mild Monster
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
George Grosz. Foreword by Berenson &
Muhlem. Peter Owens. 131 s.
Two “rival” artists jostle for position in
this handsomely produced document:
George Grosz, the savage German cari-
caturist whose name became a scanda-
lous household word during the First
World War and after (when he attacked
that form of Prussianism which was the
logical forerunner of Nazism) and
George Grosz, the genuine all-American
good guy emigre trying hard to change
into a tame wish-dream illustrator like
his idol, Norman Rockwell.
Sometimes it is difficult to believe that
these two contradictory people were in-
deed the same man and even the artist
has freely admitted to something schizo-
phrenic in his creative nature. Thus, one
page is dominated by a startling pen-and-
ink figure of Christ hanging on the cross,
as conventionally depicted as on any
ikon, except for the high boots on the
feet and the hideous pig-faced snout of
a gasmask clamped over the head. On
another there is a vicious cartoon of a
plump German doctor listening earn-
estly at the chest of a skeleton and sol-
emnly pronouncing it “K.V.” or “Fit for
active service”.
Then comes the complete antithesis:
almost photographic studies of Rubens-
esque female nudes and realistic draw-
ings of a mouse in which every whisker
is precisely filled in, recalling Durer’s
famous “Hare”. It would perhaps be
more easily understandable if these old-
fashioned “reproductions” had preceded
Grosz’s contemporary work. On the con-
trary, they followed it at a time when
his own disciples, the New World
painters of protest like Ben Shahn, were
busily debunking the American way of
life and death.
What had happened to the Grosz who
had once admitted, “I had no love of
the people, either inside or out”? He
had. one feels, simply discovered Amer-
ica. From the moment he was invited to
New York in 1932 to teach at the Arts
Student League, he left his social criti-
cism behind him. For Grosz, even the
depression time in USA was starred
with rainbows and he saw nothing but
his own private streets which were uni-
formly paved with gold. “Time” found
him a disappointingly “mild monster”
and art critics wrote headings like “Is
Grosz slipping?” and “Death of an
artist”. All the same, he prospered
financially immediately he set foot in
the promised land and gladly exchanged
his role of soap-box orator with that of
successful business man of Manhattan.
For other artists like Chagall and Dali,
America was a geographical location
where they went on painting just as in
Europe. But for Grosz it was a spiritual
home, a sort of Nirvana where all cares
ceased. Perhaps, too, by the age of 39
he had sown all the wild oats he wanted
to. His youth had been turbulent; he
was expelled from school at 13 for hit-
ting a teacher but won a scholarship to
the Berlin Academy of Art where he cut
classes. He is supposed to have learned
more from the work of Wilhelm Busch,
father of the comic-strip, than from his
professors. He sold his first cartoon to
the famous “Berliner Tageblatt” when
only 16 and bought his first bit of
America, imported shoes, with the pro-
ceeds.
His war-service seems to have brought
out all his vitriolic hatred of the Prus-
sians. Together with Brecht and Weill, his
name became a Daumier-like symbol of
the Berlin of the ’twenties, pitilessly
peopled with fat Philistines, blowsy girls,
sodden derelicts ' and pimps. Like many
intellectuals of this period he had a brief
flirtation with Marx, but returned from
Russia in 1922, revolted for life by what
he had seen. His drawings continued to
grow in savagery: stupid, thick-necked,
stiff-collared men and graceless, ogling
women whom he manages to unclothe
at the same, time as he clothes them. His
horrifying apocalyptic horsemen, his axe-
murderers and drooling lunatics are no
less shocking than those which brought
actual charges of blasphemy against him
or of undermining the spirit of the army
(lawsuits followed his Christ in a gas
mask and his prostitute wearing a cross).
Of course, all this litigation finally made
his name and his living and Grosz grin-
ningly welcomed every writ.
Somewhere towards the end of his life,
the two Groszes link up. The artist
can no longer look at the world through
his own blind-spot and reality impinges
again on his fantasy. The result is the
sudden appearance of his stickmen,
match-figures waving tattered rainbows
or standing with vacant faces waiting for
Godot. Finally comes his totally un-
related “Old Man Watering Flowers”, a
shadowy, fleshless being, probably him-
self.
Unfortunately, “Hommage a Gogol”,
a poster-colored clown, is not in this
volume, though it is probably his own
final testament. The parallels between
Gogol and Grosz are uncanny: both
started as social satirists, both lived in
exile, both had second thoughts about
their philosophy and both returned to
their native land shortly before their
deaths. The latter appears strangely like
precognition: Grosz died after a drink-
ing bout a few weeks after a reluctant
visit to Berlin in 1959.
The book is excellently printed, with
114 illustrations, 6 color-plates, an
article by the artist, a foreword and a
comprehensive bibliography.

Those Inscrutable Hindus
By K HUSHWANT SINGH
Gods, Demons and Others. R. K. Narayan.
Heinemann. 31s. 6d.
R. K. Narayan is India’s leading novelist
in the English language. His brother, Lax-
man, is the country’s leading cartoonist.
The combination is formidable and the
theme they have chosen is one in which
they could both exploit their talents to
the fullest. They are Tamil Brahmins
well-versed in Sanskrit lore. The stories
they tell in words and pictures were told
them by their grandparents and repeated
ad nauseam —as every story is in India—
by village bards and acted annually by
folk theatre troupes. Despite all this,
“Gods, Demons and Others” makes
tedious reading and the illustrations,
which are match-box-sized blocks of
black-and-white, do little more than
break the monotony of the printed page.
Mr Narayan has erred in trying to
translate Indian folk tales into an idiom
intelligible to the Western reader whose
notions of mythology are strictly
Hellenic. Greek mythology is essentially
symbolic. It seeks to explain the
phenomena of nature the origin of
the world, the seasons, thunder, light-
ning and rain; the human psyche, love
and hate, envy and gratitude, narcis-
sism, Oedipus complex, mother fixation,
etc., death and re-birth. Indian mythol-
ogy, although it may incidentally; touch
on these themes, is not in the Greek sense
either symbolic or a fictional interpreta-
tion of life or natural phenomena. What
often shocks the Western reader is its
basic amorality. The Indian myth-
maker was seldom bothered with ethical
concepts such as the triumph of right
over wrong. His gods were often men
of evil design; his demons, god-fearing
ogres who spent thousands of years in
solitary meditation. His goddesses often
behaved like sluts; hix sluts were often
so golden-hearted as to compel the
reader to place a halo over their heads.
An Indian mythological tale is like a
surrealist painting—only the initiated can
make sense out of it. When the Indian
mythologist’s approach is completely dif-
ferent it is hardly fair to him or to his
audience to be told that in fact his
problem is the same as that of his Greek
counterpart. This is apparent in the
first three stories narrated by Mr
Narayan. A short introduction tells us
that “each story is concerned with a
discovery in the realm of spirit: Lavana
explores the nature of time; Chudala
deals with the unfoldment of the psyche;
Yayati, in part, examines the age-old
quest for perpetual youth”. You read
the exploits of Lavana, Chudala and
Yayati and find but the vaguest allusion
to time, psyche or immortality. If you
are charitably inclined, you shake your
head and murmur “these inscrutable,
mysterious Hindus!” If you are not, you
explode and say “this is sheer nonsense”.
The chief value of these stories, culled
from the ancient epics Ramayana and
Mahabharata, is that they explain certain
facets of Hinduism and the conditioning
of the Hindu mind —even the mind of
the modern generation of Hindus.
Hindus take their mythology seriously.
They take improbabilities and gross
exaggerations of time and space in their
stride. They will give due weight and
consideration to different interpretations
but will be angered at any attempt to
make them appear ludicrous which
they are. The fate of Aubrey Menen,
the half-Hindu author of “Rama Retold”,
is a case in point. Menen had the
audacity to make fun of the characters
of the Ramayana. It was a hilariously
successful venture acclaimed by many
English critics as Menen's best work.
It soured many Hindus. The Govern-
ment of India yielded to their pressure
and banned “Rama Retold” on grounds
of profanity. What would be extremely
interesting is to read these two versions
of the Ramayana one after the other
Aubrey Menen debunk R. K. Narayan.
Three Pounds
of Humor
By TOM PICKERING
The Fireside Book of Modern Humor.
Edited by Scott Meredith. Hamish
Hamilton. 535.
I have never been able to resist big fat
anthologies of humor and, as it is some
time since we have had a really obese
one, “The Fireside Book of Modern
Humor” is a publication to gladden
the heart. It will make an ideal gift
and weighing exactly three pounds
without its jacket quite a handy
weapon. To the reviewer, however, it
presents problems. With a book of 986
pages, containing 600 humorous pieces
by as many authors, practically the only
possible approach is the statistical one.
Obviously one cannot comment on each
selection, and to single out one’s own
favorites for special mention would also
have little point what has me rolling
on the floor is likely to cause the next
man to raise one eyebrow or spit. Of
course, one could attempt to define
humor or establish the difference between
wit and humor, but this is a trap even
Scott Meredith, in his introduction, is
wise enough to avoid. As he says, “the
question of what makes people laugh and
why is easily the second most complex
subject in the world (the first being
women).” Freud called the technique of
wit “condensation with modification and
substitution” and, for all I know, he
could be right, but the old spoilsport is
not going to take away my pleasure in
this feast of fun by explaining it as an
“economy of psychic expenditure”.
To make his choice, Mr Meredith
(whose enthusiasm for his subject has
earned him a reputation as a “humor
expert”), went through over 3000 books
and 5000 issues of magazines and, con-
sidering only material published between
1900 and the present, he has selected one
representative piece by each author he
feels should be in a comprehensive col-
lection of twentieth-century humor. The
essay and short story forms predominate,
but there are also poems and excerpts
from novels, plays and biographies.
Tiger’s Dead
Nine-ninths: one car wheel.
He’s dead.
I backed over him.
He’s dead, I loved him
Etc.
But the striking thing is
How dead, the degree
Of utter deadness, he manifests.
For all his back-fencing,
Under-the-housir.g,
On-the-prowling
He couldn’t be deader
If he’d practised,
Readied himself,
Deployed his talents thither
Instead of ravishing each she on the
beat.
Being perfectly dead
Needs no effort
It seems.

When a Just Man Dies
By VIVIAN SMITH
Of Poetry and Power. Edited by E. A.
Glikes and Paul Schwaber. Basic Books.
New York. 68s.
This book is a collection of poems oc-
casioned by the Presidency and by the
death of John F. Kennedy. It was*
gathered together in imitation of an an-
thology that appeared soon after the as-
sassination of Abraham Lincoln and the
editors hope that it will prove to contain
poems as great as Melville’s, Lowell’s and
Whitman’s famous elegies.
We now know enough about art to
know that there is no equivalent between
intensity of response to an event and
one’s ability to write a successful poem
about it; and one can assert confidently
on the evidence of this book that the
great poems about Kennedy's death are
yet to be written. In fact the most moving
tribute here is contained in a letter from
Kathleen Raine printed in the introduc-
tion w'here she expresses her sense of
profound personal sorrow at Kennedy’s
death and it is significant that Miss
Raine had no poem to offer on the sub-
ject. She was in fact too moved by the
event to write about it.
This paradox is illustrated very w'ell
by the handful of outstanding poems
here: the noble simplicity of Auden’s
elegy which ends:
‘‘When a just man dies! lamentation and
praise/ sorrow and joy are one” but
fine as it is, there is nothing specifically
about Kennedy in this poem: it is about
all great and just men; Donald Hall’s
excellent poem “Spider Head” is neither
about Kennedy nor his assassin. Only
G. S. Fraser’s “Instead of an Elegy”
manages to deal with the actual details
of Kennedy’s life and death by subtly
relating them to details of classical myth-
ology and this is the finest poem in the
whole book.
A number of well-knowm poets from
Roy Fuller to John Berryman, from
May Sevenson to Vernon Watkins have
tried to write personal poems about the
public events associated with Kennedy,
but among these only Roy Fuller suc-
ceeds in making a statement at once indi-
vidual and poetic.
The prize for the most inept poem
here surely goes to George T. Wright
(Associate Professor of English at the
University of Tennessee) for his prothala-
mium: “Moving into the wooden rows/
Passive while the organ pumps/ We know
of light beyond the windows/But heavy
now the triumph thumps.” It does in-
deed.
Neither the memory of a great man
nor the integrity of art is served by some
of the pieces gathered here.
Bluff King Hal
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Henry VIII. John Bowie. Allen & Unwin.
58s.
The Tudor monarchs, Henry VII, Henry
VIII and Elizabeth I, were splendidly
fearsome figures—intelligent, domineer-
ing and as hard as nails. The European
Renaissance arrived belatedly in England,
but when it came, after the old feudal
baronage had cut its own throat in the
Wars of the Roses, it came with revolu-
tionary force.
The reign of Henry VIII was a water-
shed between two ages. Henry was just
as much a product of his times as
Charles V and Francis I, but his over-
powering personality produced events of
the aspect of high drama, as lurid as
any story the Jacobean playwrights later
put on the stage.
Henry VIII has always w'orn two faces
to posterity. There is Bluff King Hal,
roaring, wrestling, w'enching and gnaw-
ing beef bones to the delight of his
admiring subjects. There is also the
Henry who looks out of the famous
portrait attributed (dubiously) to Hol-
bein, a murderous sensualist, “a terrify-
ing tyrant balancing a bull’s torso on
legs like pillars”, with “heavy bearded
jowl, small predatory nose and flat
hawk’s eyes gleaming with malice and
attention”. Henry, the despoiler of the
Church, the butcher of his kinsmen and
two of his wives.
Henry is a tempting subject for
biographers and too many of them have
been either frankly partisan or mere
scandalmongers,' in either case grossly
oversimplifying the major issues in 16th-
century England. John Bowie misses
none of the drama. A refreshing and
absorbing book, his combines a vivid
picture of Henry himself with a lucid
exposition of the difficult subject of
Tudor statecraft. If Henry appears some-
what larger than life, it is because he
did indeed dominate the scene more
completely than any other sovereign
before or since. His ministers, even
great men like Wolsey, Cranmer and
Cromwell, existed at his pleasure and
fell in abject submission at his frown.
Henry’s relationship with the Catholic
Church is the rock on which partisan

biography splits. Henry lusted after
Anne Boleyn so he forced his subjects to
become Protestants, ' says one simple
rationalisation. Henry cleared the way
for England’s imperial future by ruth-
lessly subordinating Church to State, says
another. In fact, Henry’s divorce was a
catalyst precipitating religious feelings
that had been fermenting since the days
of Wycliffe and were now powerfully
reinforced by the spread of Lutheran
ideas. John Bowie demonstrates con-
vincingly the violent anti-clerical senti-
ment of the Parliament of 1529 when
the devout More was Chancellor and the
Act of Supremacy was still five years
away.
Religion, politics and economics were
inextricably interwoven in developments
that were to shape England’s history for
centuries. Fat with the plunder of
Church estates a new aristocracy was
rising out of the ruins of the Plantagenet
baronage. Henry was a typical Renais-
sance prince in his patronage of the
“new men”, lawyers and merchants like
the Russells, Cecils and Cavendishes,
who established a landed oligarchy that
was to rule England until the Reform
Bill. Henry founded the Royal Navy,
creating a portentous weapon for the
future out of the already - existing
tradition of British seamanship. As
Bowie justifiably says: “With politic
calculation and bull-headed obstinacy,
and through agents whom he used and
broke, he changed the destiny of
England.”
The Facts About Britain
By R. M. WILDING
Two Cheers for the Town Hall. Hervey
Benham. Hutchinson. 38s. 6d.
The Other England. Geoffrey Moorhouse.
Penguin Books. ss. 6d.
Mr Benham takes one British provincial
area Colchester and parts of rural
Essex and examines how it is run,
what goes on, what life is like there. As
managing editor of three local news-
papers there, he is in a position to write
authoritatively. And write authoritatively
he does about the Colchester Technical
College, the problems of Colchester’s
library, of the one-way streets and pro-
posed ring roads, of the clubs and
societies —from CND to bird fanciers,
the Multiple Sclerosis Society to the
Operatic Society—for the people of Col-
chester to participate in. He writes of
the development of the refuse-collection
service, and of the man who repeatedly
broke up Essex County Council meet-
ings—“scrambling about underneath the
table and . . . running round the table
banging the chairman's gavel on it as he
went and shouting at the top of his
voice”.
Mr Benham is never sensational. What
is amazing is that he is never dull. He
writes about the things that make
English provincial life not just in
administrating it, not just in the politics
of it, but in the sort of things going on
in it.
“As long as the metropolitan persists
in regarding society outside his immedi-
ate experience as somehow unsmart and
uncouth, and is content that it should
otherwise be an unknown quantity to
him, so long will the other England
remain.” The other England is the
England not around London and Mr
Moorhouse deals with seven areas of it.
Economic decline is one of Mr Moor-
house’s concerns and he deals with it
urgently in his section on North-East
England, now well known, as he points
out, as a problem area; and in his
chapter on the West Country an area
seemingly totally neglected by the plan-
ners. Cornwall, the favorite holiday dis-
trict, has the highest unemployment rate
in Britain its mines have closed, its
fishing declined; there were 100 boats
fishing from Cornish ports in 1956
there are only 30 now.
But Mr Moorhouse deals with more
than just the economic problems. He
writes about color prejudice in the Mid-
lands, that Smethwick election with the
slogan that no one knows who invented,
“If you want a nigger neighbor, vote
Labor”. The local Conservative leader
remarked “that he would not condemn
anyone who said such a thing and that
he thought it was a manifestation of
popular feeling”. And there is also the
problem of the wholesale redevelopment
of provincial cities by private enterprise
canny businessmen making fortunes
from property speculation when the
councils cannot afford to raise money
for development themselves. And there
are the rural areas, neglected districts of
East Anglia still visited by the “night
cart” because there is no sewerage
system. I remember, five years ago in the
Midlands, cottages with no running
water, dependent on an outside pump—
while in the field beside, belonging to
the same farmer, piped water for the
cattle.
These may not be aspects of England
presented by the British Exhibition. They
are not the aspects advertised by the
travel organisations; but they are the
conditions under which most Englishmen
live.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
No Haste on Imports
T>re - Budget consultations between
businessmen and Federal Ministers
left the impression that no hasty moves
would be made to impose import con-
trols. A firm statement on imports policy
was demanded by the Woolgrowers and
Graziers’ Council because of the likely
speculation by importers on the possi-
bility of import controls, thus adding an
unnecessary burden to the balance of
payments as importers stockpiled in an
effort to beat the gun.
It has happened before. When 90 p.c.
of import licensing was lifted in Febru-
ary, 1960, the surge of imports induced
fears of re-control within a year. Rumors
of import controls prompted importers to
build up unreasonably heavy stocks while
buoyant conditions already w'ere en-
couraging a strong flow of imports. As
a result, indigestion from surplus stocks
was unduly prolonged.
If import planning today is geared to
recent business surveys, the time is in-
appropriate for importers to commit
themselves heavily to new stocks
unless such imports are needed for basic
development programmes.
Nevertheless, it has been apparent for
some years that the major components of
Australian imports are heavy capital
equipment and basic material supplies
rather than fripperies. If the regular
norm for these essential imports does
not exceed Australia’s capacity to pay
(by way of export_proceeds and capital
inflow), the rate of development in Aus-
tralia can be maintained.
But questions are now being asked
whether Australia can afford to maintain
a high rate of “essential” imports W'hen
returns from primary exports have been
reduced by drought and weaker prices
in overseas commodity markets.
There are unnecessary items imported
to Australia which could be eliminated.
Perhaps the harder times inflicted by
the drought and the tighter money era
will exert sufficient influence on these
items. Up to now the Federal Govern-
ment has been giving more than a fair
go to importers. It is to be hoped that
unnecessary stockpiling will be avoided,
so that the Government is not forced
into imposing irksome controls.
A fresh crop of trading bank reviews
have busied themselves with these matters
and the related problems of industrial
buoyancy. Their conclusions are dis-
cussed in “Economics Anonymous”, be-
ginning on the page opposite.
The Bank of New South Wales Re-
view may perhaps be allowed to speak
for the generally concordant approach:
“From the point of view of Australian
fiscal and monetary authorities the in-
ternal performance of the economy,
leaving aside the strike of copper miners
and the persistent drought in parts of
NSW, has probably seemed reasonably
satisfactory.”
The Ord Revisited
pT-he now familiar differences of opinion
A on the Ord River irrigation scheme
received still another thorough airing at
the Economic Society’s Winter School In
Sydney. Contrary to one newspaper’s
account, the opposing viewpoints led
neither to heated nor head-on clashes.
Sir Harold Raggatt (for) and Professor
K. O. Campbell (against) are old hands
at this particular debate. Their
arguments are fairly well-worn and
courteous.
All the more reason, it could be
thought, why the Federal Government
must soon approach some firm resolution
of this prolonged debate. An indefinite
postponement of a decision on the £3O
million second stage cannot help the
cause of development anywhere in Aus-
tralia.
Next month may put some very

Graziers' Council.
positive ammunition into the hands of
either side. For by then the cotton yields
of the present 27 Ord farmers will be
publicly revealed.
Sir Harold Raggatt, after a precise
analysis of costs with and without
bounty, believes that “the Ord scheme
stands up well to examination and that
delay in proceeding with it cannot be
justified on economic grounds”. Regard-
ing it as a test case, he considers it the
prototype for large-scale irrigation in
tropical Australia, adding that “no one
objects to the Ord scheme being judged
on the basis of comparison with other
British and American Share Markets
T>ather paradoxically, London
* sharemarkets put a better shine
on things than New York last week.
Both Exchanges are still undergoing
a fair measure of purely technical
correction. Yet Wall Street appeals
to be doing this to the accompaniment
of considerable dullness. Brokers there
rationalise the process by declaring
that the market is finding a base from
which to move decisively and this
move should be upward.
To help the process, the Federal
Reserve Board of New York has just
observed that “the underlying sources
of strength in the economy remain
intact”. On the other hand, though
perhaps this is only a slight change
of emphasis, gross national product
statistics suggest a slow-down of the
long boom. The pace may become
conservative and the markets may
also have to pay more attention to
Vietnam, currency problems and
possible troubles in the steel industry.
Friday’s trading on Wall Street
looked quite indecisive and at the end
had cut back gains by the Dow Jones
earlier in the week. Steels, auto-
motives and chemicals all finished
sectionally lower.
London presented more than a few
signs of rising above its long depres-
sion thus tending to confirm the
previous week’s more cheerful tone.
There was certainly nothing enliven-
ing in the overseas trade figures for
June. But of main importance might
be Mr Callaghan’s stated intention of
avoiding any further economic
measures.
In the event, though prices still
ranged irregularly, volumes were
mostly greater. Tobacco and shipping
showed the best rises and Australian
base metals were decidedly firmer.


irrigation schemes in Australia actual
or potential”.
On this very kind of criterion Pro-
fessor Campbell takes issue, with further
support for the widely held attitude that
“a better return could be obtained if the
money allocated to the scheme were
spent elsewhere”.
Muttering darkly about a mysterious
and unreleased report by the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, “negative in
tone”, the professor reiterates the claims
of evaluating every developmental
scheme .on individual merits and in terms
of cost-benefit analysis.
Defence Bonds
Taxpayers who are not anxious to face
extra tax burdens in the Budget
doubtless would support proposals by the
Associated Chambers of Commerce that
the Federal Government should launch
a defence bonds issue to help finance
Australia’s commitments for new air-
craft, ships and other equipment.
The problems of raising loan moneys
were emphasised heavily in the past
year when interest rates jumped sharply,
with a consequently depressing effect
on prices for fixed interest and equity
investments.
If the public is willing to subscribe
more readily for defence bonds, it could
alleviate some of Treasurer Holt’s
problems.
It brings home very forcibly Sir
Robert Menzies’ statement that Aus-
tralia is at war and that an official
declaration to such intent by either side
will not alter the fact that soldiers are
fighting and dying in Vietnam.
Wartime experience showed that
money flows freely for defence bonds,
but this usually is accompanied by strict
controls making it difficult to spend
money in other directions. For example,
rationing and the direction of vital
commodities into Government channels,
plus restraints on investment (fixed
upper and lower limits on stock exchange
prices), all helped to channel savings
into bonds, apart from patriotic fervor.
There is no doubt the Australian Gov-
ernment needs lashings of loan moneys
to finance the heavy defence programme
already outlined. There is no sign that
the capacity to raise money overseas
has improved in recent months.
Sir Robert Menzies, at his Press con-
ference on return from his overseas trip,
said he had not discussed the problem
of UK restraints on investment moneys.
Yet this problem may loom larger as
time goes by.
Therefore any bond raising proposal
which encourages the flow of private
sayings into special defence bonds
should be welcomed by the Treasury.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Is Industrial Production
Showing Hesitancy?
Bank surveys indicate some caution
IIfiTHOUT putting too fine a point on it,
" trading bank economists have been
more cautious than most observers of
•the industrial scene these last few months.
Their general theme has been that the
pace of expansion has slackened con-
siderably and in some directions there
has been a certain back-treading. From
their special position of being in closer
touch with the feeling in industry
through bank customers, their views on
the state of things in these weeks of
Budget planning should perhaps com-
mand the Treasurer's attention more,
say, than those of his statistically inbred
public servants cloistered in Canberra.
For good measure, also, the Treasurer
should inwardly digest the views expres-
sed to him by business leaders in their
pre-Budget talks with senior Cabinet
Ministers in Canberra last week. Nobody
is better able to express the expectations
of industry than those who make in-
dustry's decisions.
Several of the banks speak of the
“mote of hesitancy” which has stolen
on the scene. In May the ANZ observed
diverse movements in industrial produc-
tion, uncertainties in the trend of retail
spending, uncertain demand for labor,
and uneven movements in domestic
building. In its latest release, this bank
continued to expound its “levelling out”
theme in respect of building and retail
sales, admitted to a small upward move-
ment in its seasonally adjusted index of
C. F. ADERMANN
industrial production, and found the real
significance of a rise in motor registra-
tions “obscure”. But there was an ab-
sense of alarm about it all, an associa-
tion of “the levelling out of a rapid rate
of growth in the economy generally with
the attainment of full employment after
a recovery period and the real limita-
tions on the rate of expansion arising
from full utilisation of resources supple-
mented by the special factor of drought”.
The message from the Commercial
Bank of Australia is less articulate on
the industrial outlook, though it sees
warning signs “which indicate that eco-
nomic activity will automatically slow
down”, Its main pre-occupation is with
balance of payment prospects, not in-
dustry. Against this the National Bank
of Australasia thinks the volume of pro-
duction, although high, “would not ap-
pear to be rising at any marked rate”.
Spending, “instead of accelerating has
in reality tended to more or less level
off”. The impression is one of industry
being squeezed. Profits are “only mod-
est in relation to the high level of
activity”, a situation it attributes to
“higher costs, additional taxation, in-
creased competition between domestic
enterprises and from imports, and a
marked increase in promotional costs ac-
companied by price cutting in some
areas”.
The National's usual run-down of
conditions in the various States, which
is detailed and highly useful, fills out
this broad picture. However, possibly the
most apposite of the banks' surveys for
Budget planning comes from the com-
bined effort of the Bank of NSW and
the Associated Chambers of Manufac-
tures made in a round-up of industrial
trends and opinions in the first week of
this month. This survey, which has
been made at four-month intervals for
a number of years now, has the advan-
tage that it covers industry's expecta-
tions as well as past performances.
Here again is the story of production
still rising but inclined to slacken,
though not, as might have been sup-
posed, because of a scarcity of available
labor but because of, largely, a short-
age of orders. It seems that a turning
point came during the four months under
survey. At the beginning of the period
industry inclined to the view that out-
put would rise more strongly than


proved to be the case, and more than
it had in the previous four months. In
fact the ’Wales discovered that the
number of manufacturers working at a
satisfactory rate of production declined
from 65 to 60 per cent of the total
315 firms questioned.
The bank also found a considerable
increase in production for stocks as
against consumption orders, again bely-
ing expectation of manufacturers at the
beginning of the period that stocks
would decline. On the other hand, manu-
facturers on balance believe that in the
next four months stocks both of raw
materials and finished goods will decline.
This could mean either a fall in output
or an increase in consumption. It might
be inferred from the increased number
of manufacturers expecting a reduction
in overtime worked in their firms that
output was expected to slacken. The
balance of opinion is against that hap-
pening. Rather it is generally expected
that the work force will rise and so
obviate the need for so much overtime.
Probably the most significant pointer
for the next four months from this
survey is that a bigger proportion of
those questioned in July, compared with
March, predicted that their employment,
overtime, orders, output and deliveries
would remain about the same and that
most of the remainder expected an
improvement. This looks very much as
though the expectation is for industry
to go bobbing along very nicely, even
if a bit more cautiously.
This evidence that, despite rises in
costs (the ’Wales survey was taken after
the increase of H per cent in margins
was knowm to manufacturers), indus-
trial production is standing up well and
should continue to do so is helpful for
assessments of the likely availability of
resources in general. Moreover, the
evidence of the survey that industry
expects to reduce its pace of fixed invest-
ment in the next year, after looking to
progressively higher rates of increase in
fixed investment over the previous six-
teen months, offers some prospect of
diverting an increasing amount of
resources to defence production.
Possibly the Treasurer is thinking of
weaning more resources away from
secondary industry for the latter purpose.
He would certainly exacerbate the rise
in industrial costs and so have to achieve
such an object by imposing high addi-
tional taxes. Many firms are extremely
vulnerable at present on this count, the
more so since they will have to begin
absorbing the latest margins rise in the
next few months as this is translated into
industrial awards outside the metal
trades. This was one of the main mes-
ages carried by the business world to
Canberra for the talks with Cabinet
last week, but the Treasurer might well
have put his own interpretation on it.
As industry sees it, however, the danger
is that, as the National Bank has
emphasised, with profit margins already
being pinched and no relief from imports
competition in sight, industrial produc-
tion could be impaired by higher com-
pany tax and, by another route, through
reduced personal consumption brought
about by higher sales and income tax.
by imports competition in
using the escape route of increasing
prices to alleviate their cost problems,
naturally Australian manufacturers
(vide AIDA) have been strongly can-
vassing the possibilities of import
restrictions being imposed. Cabinet is
quite adamant on this matter, however,
and Ministers at the meetings in Can-
berra gave not the slightest sign of
accepting the case for import restrictions.
Indeed, on the eve of the talks, the
Minister for Primary Industry, Mr C. E.
Adermann, went to great lengths to
reinforce the Government’s opposition to
restrictions. He told the Australian Agri-
cultural Council that the export prospect
f<»r this year was a good deal better than
had been first thought when assessing
the possible effect of the drought on
the quantity of rural exports. This could
be equally as decisive as capital inflow
in determining how long our overseas
reserves could stand up to the continua-
tion of unrestricted importing at current
levels without approaching danger point.
Although he doesn’t expect an early
recovery in wool prices (despite the
rather better recent trend), Mr Ader-
mann reckoned the wool clip would be
down only about 7 per cent on last
year. He expected the wheat harvest to
be in the order of 250 million bushels
and production of dairy products to be
about the same as last year. On the
other hand, meat quantities would be
well down and sugar production 9 per
cent lower than the target of 2.26
million tons. Mr Adermann stopped
short of making forecasts on prices, so
what all these variations amount to in
terms of reduction in rural exports is
anybody's guess. However, he gave the
impression it wouldn’t be catastrophic.
If he is right, doubtless import freedom
will be continued in the foreseeable
future, always providing, of course, that
capital inflow behaves itself (it certainly
seems to have done so in the June
quarter). In that case, local manufac-
turers wall have to look elsewhere for
relief of the cost problem. This is where
Mr Holt might come in to help them
sustain industrial output.

A Night of Nostalgia
Bankers in the Bamboo Room
/V lot of loose ends still have to be
tidied up before an epitaph can be
written on the development company
victims of the last few years. Though
receivers and liquidators are hard at
work in a number of these companies,
they cannot hope to tie the final knots
for years in some of them, like Reid
Murray and various members of the
Korman company circle. Nor have the
courts finished their tasks by any means.
There is still a great deal to do before
the legal fate of some of the companies
is sealed, payments to the various classes
of claimants determined and settled, and
t e States pound of flesh taken from
some of the company principals respons-
ible for the failures. .
Company fortunes and economic
fluctuations being what they are, doubt-
less we have not seen the last of the
failures. Indeed there looks to be one
pretty big mess in Savoy Corporation
still to be aired before disillusioned
shareholders. But for those of us who
have had our work cut out in the last
few years keeping pace with the spate of
public company victims, the virtual
absence of speculative fever in the
economy in the last two years of buoyant
activity has made the task more tract-
able. At the same time we miss the
company theatre of the high dramatic
quality the likes of Stanley Korman and
Rex Testro used to turn on at the
Bamboo Room at the Chevron in St
Kilda Road.
The Bamboo Room has almost gone
out of business, but not quite, since Mr
Korman moved out of the Chevron and
the Commonwealth Trading Bank moved
in to try to retrieve some of the money it
had lent to this wholly owned subsidiary
0 f Stanhill Consolidated—now, like SDF
and Chevron Sydney, under liquidation,
j n the latter circumstances, one would
hardly expect the Bamboo Room to be
called on t 0 stage any more battles be _
tween shareholders and directors,
On the contrary, it seemed symbolic of
the relative dearth of speculative fever
in the economy, as well as of the fact
that most of the aftermath of the last
lot has been played out, that the Corn-
monwealth Trading Bank, in exercise of
its receivership rights, should recently
have chosen the Bamboo Room for a
gathering of the solid elite of Melbourne’s

STANLEY KORMAN
new managing director of the Common-
wealth Banking Corporation.
For the financial Press this was a night
of nostalgia. Rubbing shoulders with the
Federal Treasurer, listening to the likes
of Sir Warren McDonald, mixing with
the assembled cream of business, in-
dustry and the professions and sipping
the bubbly (one seldom gets that at com-
pany meetings), the haunting voices of
the fallen developers crowded in. One
could spare a thought for their ill-fated
enterprise and the reckoning. They told
much of their tale in the Bamboo Room
and a good deal of the story is strewn
along these very reaches of St Kilda
Road, which Mr Korman dreamed of
making his own.
It seemed only yesterday, for instance,
that one was having what Mr John Hall,
managing director of Savoy Corporation,
called a quick business lunch at Factors
House (505), a short step up the road
from Chevron. Like Stanley Korman,
here was a developer in a hurry if ever
I saw one. He swept up to the top of
No. 505 half an hour late, then handed
sandwiches around. It was all over in
thirty minutes. His main message was
that the ever-alert financial editor of
“The Sydney Morning Herald” had done
him wrong, that an American company
was standing by to put £3 million or
more into a building society Savoy had
taken over, that the shares were good
buying and, generally, the sky was the
limit. It all seemed appropriate coming
from 505, yet I decided to stand by and
watch, not report it.
Last week, after getting a cut-off signal
from Savoy’s old telephone number, I
called at this address again, only to find
that the company had departed and,
according to the commissionaire, could
only be contacted under another name
somewhere in Lonsdale Street. The
leading PR firm touting Savoy’s charms
not much more than a year ago must
surely be hanging its head.
Mr V. T. Gladstones, the leading Mel-
bourne accountant who reluctantly
accepted an invitation to try to rescue
Factors at one stage but ultimately gave
up the ghost (Mr Korman succeeded in
the end), once told me he thought the
Factors building at 505 was worth a
quarter of a million, though he couldn’t
find a buyer. Now, not only has Savoy
deserted it, but Factors also, leaving
both the ground (or part of it) and top
floors to < let. The motto, “Keep the
wheels of your industry turning”, on
the foundation stone laid by Mr Bolte
on October 6, 1960, was something
Factors failed to do, in Australia any-
way. Its only operational subsidiary is
now Holeproof (NZ). It has changed its
registered office three times in as many
years and can now be found huddled
together in much less pretentious
premises further down the road at Mac-
quarie House (541), with a bunch of
other' Korman companies such as Stan-
hill Consolidated, SDF and Stanhill
Estates, surrounded by windy corridors
and also space to let.
All this must be very galling to Mr
Korman because Factors House, although
a bit too ornate for my liking, was the
house of his dreams. Here is his monu-
ment and, if you like, a standing re-
minder of the company follies of 1960,
indeed about the only one in these
immediate parts. True, Mr Raymond
Borg has provided one a little furtner
down on the other side of St Kilda Road
in a prosaic new office block occupied
largely by Vehicle and General Insur-
ance. More solid and abiding develop-
ment companies have been erecting
theirs, too, in St Kilda Road in the last
year or two. Lend Lease, for instance,
has just completed a massive office block
on a former Korman site (433), where
the Maestro had hoped to erect a sky-
scraper hotel at one stage but was turned
down by the building authorities.
London County Properties are build-
ing another similar block nearer the city.
There are, of course, a number of non-
development companies, BP for instance,
which have lately built solidly in St
Kilda Road.
The latest firm ro tempt providence
and build on the Korman stretch of this
broad avenue linking the city to its
biggest traffic snarl (soon to be relieved
by the £4 million reconstruction scheme
for St Kilda Junction) is G. J. Coles,
which is to construct a new head office
next to Factors House itself. This is to
be an eight-storey block over a 200 ft
frontage and is expected to be ready by
1970.
The future of the decentralisation
movement of business and professional
activities away from the heart of the city
into St Kilda Road would seem to depend
more on the likes of firms such as Coles
going out. Already one finds a number
well established, such as Repco, Colonial
Gas Holdings, BP, the Victorian Auto-
mobile Chamber of Commerce (now ex-
tending its premises). Data Control is
another currently building in St Kilda
Road, just round the corner from IBM
and Burroughs in Fitzroy Street, forming
a solid nucleus of business equipment
firms in that area. In the result, St Kilda
Road is becoming more and more a
kaleidoscope of Melbourne business and
community life.
Even so, when the national economic
pot is hotting up or on the boil, one can
usually count on much of the froth blow-
ing off on either side of this generous
tree-lined avenue. A Korman will
appear, mopping up delectable sites,
planning towers and skyscraper hotels
and nameplates of unheard-of people
(and their associates). Management, per-
sonnel and business consultants will
proliferate on shaky mailboxes outside
colonial mansions, hire-purchase com-
panies will come to take up new
positions. Generally there will be an
atmosphere of bright young men and
their prosperity-sprung businesses going
places around the periphery of the hard
economic core.

A Pile-up of Duplicates
Copying machines on the make
Tn Australia’s high-speed business
world high-speed copiers are be-
ing used more widely every day. In
proportion to population the Australian
businessman, in terms of the number
of copying machines available to him,
is far better off than his American or
European counterpart. Yet now that
copying machines have become tech-
nologically so advanced, he is as likely
to be as confused as his foreign brother
about claims made for the machines’
performance and their relative advan-
tages over a competitor’s product.
Today the businessman can choose
from about 140 different copying
machines, ranging in price from £4O to
nearly £6OOO.
The annual value of copying in Aus-
tralia (not the annual value of sales of
copying machines) has been know-
ledgeably assessed as in excess of
£5 million. An executive of one copy-
ing machine organisation estimated
that about 100 million documents,
drawings, newspaper cuttings, etc.
are copied each year. It is hard to put
an actual price on the cost of each
copy made, since some machines make
copies for about lid., others for 3s. 2d.
The all-over average cost appears to be
in the region of 5 id. to 6d. Calculation
of the value of copying is further com-
plicated by the fact that while the first
copy may cost, say Is., additional
copies may cost only 3d. each.
According to “MODE” (Modern Of-
fice and Data Equipment) magazine of
March, 1964, there are seven basic sys-
tems of copying. They are, with brief
explanations:
Diffusion: a wet chemical process
which involves making a negative of the
item to be copied, then a positive. Cost
of the machines ranges between £4O to
£350. Diffusion, says “MODE”, is the
most expensive process but can produce
very high quality copies.
Dye transfer: similar to diffusion ex-
cept matter to be copied is “dyed” rath-
er than photographed on the copying
medium. Prices range from £56 to about
£2OO.
Stabilisation: another photographic
process which, unlike diffusion, requires
only one type of paper to produce copies.
The operator can make as many posi-
tives from the same negative as he
wants. Machines cost from £llO to
£165 10s.
Diazo: the lowest cost per copy pro-
cess. It, too, is a photographic process
but, unlike the preceding three, is a dry
one. Matter to be copied must be trans-
lucent, with writing on one side only.
Copies can be produced for as little as
2d. each. Prices from £l4O fo £5600.
Thermography: another dry process,
this time using heat to produce copies on
sensitised paper, rather than chemicals.
The sensitised paper is available in a
wide range of colors and weights; pre-
printed invoices, ledgers, accounts and
so on are available for systems work.
Cost from £135 to £550.
Electrostatic or Xerographic: machines
operate on the principle of opposite elec-
trical charges, attraction and transfer, via
a selenium drum or thermoplastic dust,
from the projected image of the article
to be copied to ordinary paper, which
is then exposed to heat, thus fusing the
dust. Machines cost from £540 up. Some
are available only on a rental basis.
Dual spectrum: the newest copying
process. Uses the light spectrum for ex-
posure and the heat spectrum for de-
velopment. It requires specially sensitised
paper. Cost from £lB5 to £2OO.

One of the largest firms in the copy-
ing machine industry is the Xerox Cor-
poration of America, which operates
here through Rank Xerox (Australia)
Pty Ltd. It produces five copying mach-
ines: the 913 (produces copies up to 9
inches by 13 inches), the 814 (8 by 14),
the 1385 (13 by 8.5), the Copyflo (which
copies on to a continuous roll of paper
and is especially useful for copying seis-
mograph charts, etc.) and the 1824 (18
by 24).
All Xerox machines work on the
electrostatic process (which has been
trade-named the Xerographic process)
and. with the exception of the Copyflo,
are available for rent only. The 914 is
renicd on the basis of 2000 copies or
£4O a month (i.e., 6d. a copy). Copies
over the 2000 mark cost 4d. each. The
813 costs £2l 13s. 4d. a month to rent,
with a minimum usage of 800 copies,
Bernard Heafey, manager of market
planning for Rank X-rox in Australia,
said Rank Xerox claims to do 70 p.c.
of the copying work in this country.
Other firms The Bulletin spoke to
suggested this claim was a “little high”.
(“Perhaps 40 p.c. would be closer to the
mark.” one company said.) Mr Heafey
said one of the greatest advantages of
Xerography was that the process would
copy on to anything—“even an egg”. The
company’s refusal to sell its machines and
only to rent them meant important tax
concessions for users. He stressed that
the machines are rented (on a 30-day
basis) and not leased. “The Xerographic
process is being used for things other
than copying printed or drawn matter.”
A spokesman for Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing (Australia) Pty Ltd
(3M), which produces Thermofax brand
copiers, said he could not see any reason
why the market for copying machines
in Australia should ever become satu-
rated. “There will always be a market for
copying, though you could find that the
market five years from now looks nothing
like it does at present,” the spokesman
said.
“New uses for copying machines are
being introduced all the time. One we
have brought into Australia recently,
which uses a copying machine for the
production of bills and accounts, has al-
ready been very well received. The Aus-
tralian businessman is realising that by
using copying machines he can improve
paperwork efficiency at a fraction of the
former cost.”
Stiff competition from Rank Xerox,
with its 914 and 813 machines, is caus-
ing concern among other copying mach-
ine manufacturers. Even if its claim to
70 p.c. of the copying market is high,
the fact that it has one of the smallest
percentages of machines in the overall
machine market is indicative of the ac-
ceptance its Xerographic process has
gained since the company entered the
Australian market in the last few years.
The 3M company, to counter Xerox’s
effect, stresses the need for “decentralisa-
tion” of copying machines. Instead of
having only one in an office, the com-
pany suggests a number of machines at
strategic points. “The copying room so
often becomes a ‘gossip room’,” one of
3M’s brochures says. “The penalty of a
centralised copying unit is the time spent
travelling to and from the area and
waiting for the copy.”
Another company stresses the value of
portability. (The Xerox 914 is a floor
unit, and far from portable. The 813,
however, is portable.) Portability, says
the Xerox competitor, means flexibility,
particularly where copying may need to
be done away from the central office.
Whatever the advantages of one mach-
ine over another, it’s certain copying is
here to stay. Let us hope that, by sim-
plifying paperwork, it doesn’t create
more.

Warming to Expansion
Competition among frozen food groups
As The Bulletin said when Piet an-
nounced its issue to shareholders,
these frozen food companies are cer-
tainly expanding at an enviable rate and
churning out the capital benefits. Two of
the big names in the industry appear to
be competing on more than the market-
ing front. Now Frozen Food Industries
plans an issue to shareholders.
It will be a one-for-three at a premium
of 3s. on each ss. share. The £120,000
raised will finance increases in productive
capacity. These have been made neces-
sary by continued rises in demand.
Like Piet, Frozen Foods has also raised
expansionary cash through another
source as well. A private placement of
4000 shares at a premium of 7s. has been
made through Melbourne sharebrokers
G. E. Carrington and Co. The two issues
will lift paid capital to £300,000.
The issue announcement carried further
good news for shareholders. Dividend
for the year to June 30 will be raised
from 10 to lli p.c. The year’s figures
will be released on August 16, before
rights trading commences on the shares
arising from the issue.
It is already well on the cards that
the profit will show a substantial in-
crease over last year. In the nine months
to the end of March, the result was
higher than in the full 1963-64 term.
Profit of £40,000-odd equalled 24.2 p.c.
on capital on an annual basis. Profit in
1963-64 totalled £38,000.
It seems that shareholders can look
forward to higher dividends and further
issues over the next few years.
Bid for a Market
A long with Frozen Food's announce-
ment last week came the news that
Sou’West Frozen Food Packers Ltd had
received another takeover bid. The com-
pany is not listed. The bid, worth
£845,000, came from a large Australian
listed group whose name the directors
were not prepared to reveal.
A fairly safe bet is that the bid came
from British Tobacco. It has already
taken an interest in another locally
owned frozen food group. As the com-
pany’s soft drink expansion shows, BT is
not the one to move into a new industry
in any singular fashion.
Sou’West is the holding company for
the Sunkist companies, which process and
market a wide range of frozen products
including vegetables and ice cream. Fro-
zen vegetable production last season was
almost 20 p.c. of the Australian total.
Shareholders decided not to sell their
shares “on this occasion”.
However, at the time of going to press,
directors have notified shareholders that
“certain new negotiations are going on”.
If they too prove unsuccessful, a one-for-
three issue will be made to raise expan-
sionary cash.
In the current year, the company ex-
pects to double the 1963-64 profit of
£38,000. In 1962-63 a loss of £72,000
was incurred. Balance date is September
30. Sales last year rose from £750,000
to £2,300,000 and it is known that several
overseas and local companies made over-
tures with view to takeover during the
12 months. Sales have continued to rise
at a rapid rate in the current year.
It seems only a matter of time before
the group either accepts a takeover offer
or floats publicly. In fact, the new offer
may have been accepted by the time this
edition reaches the streets. More than
two years ago, shareholders were told
that the group might seek public listing
after another profitable season. Failing
takeover, 1965 could be the year for a
public float. Directors have said that the
possible one-for-three share issue will be
the last at par before they issue shares to
outside sources.
The plain fact seems to be that, to
maintain its share of the market, the
company must raise more cash for ex-
pansion. The amount necessary .could be
gained from the public in the long run.
But if a takeover offers the shareholders
bigger capital gains, then they may very
well sell out. Further and more generous
offers have yet to come, unless this latest
one is successful.
Tiles for the US
/Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd
has formed a jointly owned com-
pany with US-based Raymond Inter-
national Inc. to produee concrete roofing
tiles in the US. The company, known
as Monier-Raymond Concrete Tile Co.,
expects to be in production in eight
months at its first factory in Orange
County, about 40 miles from Los
Angeles.
Australian-made machinery will be used
in the project. The managing director
of Concrete Industries, Mr K. B. C. Mil-
burn, said concrete tiles are becoming
more popular in the US because of the
high fire insurance premiums being
charged for houses roofed with the
traditional bituminous and timber shingle.
He added: “Naturally the Monier in-
vestment in this project will be sub-
stantial; on the other hand the potential
for Concrete Industries is of a magnitude
beyond the perception of most Anf-
tralians.”

Sugar Losses
Oixth on the list of sugar companies
to report a worse result for the 1964-
65 year is Haughton Sugar Co. Ltd of
northern Queensland, which incurred a
loss of £45,979 after a two-thirds increase
in depreciation provision. In a brief
statement which does not give the reasons
for the loss, directors say that, subject
to audit, profit before depreciation was
£104,655, compared with £363,402 the
previous year. Profit after deductions
last year was £164,402.
Directors said depreciation to be
written off was £68,315 (previously
£45,524) and special depreciation of
£64,319 (£44,426), making a total of
£150,364 compared with the previous
year’s total of £90,000. There is no
taxation provision. Last year it was
£109,000.
In the latest year Haughton crushed
282,259 tons of cane (previously 241,032
tons) to yield 39,144 tons of sugar
(36,556 tons). AH sugar companies have
reported lower profits from sugar as a
result of the low w'orld price and, in
some cases, adverse seasonal conditions.
Haughton, how'ever, is the first to report
a loss.
Back-Door Listing
TTVer newsworthy, Melbourne’s quarry-
ing industry has taken another fasr
cinating turn. The privately owned Galli
earthworks and contracting group is to
list itself through the proverbial “back
door” by- getting the public company,
Earthworks and Quarries, to take it over.
Messrs M. and L. Galli will join the
Earthworks’ board as managing directors.
In return for these favors the Galli group
will pay off all Earthworks’ trade
creditors and take the company out of
the hands of the official receiver and
manager.
As part of the deal, Galli will acquire
a minimum 25 p.c. interest in Earth-
works. Mr A. K. Bowen (founder and
director of Consolidated Quarries) holds
52 p.c. of the capital in shares and op-
tions. Although he could sell a 25 p.c.
share to Galli, he has decided that general
shareholders should be given the oppor-
tunity of selling 25 p.c. of their holdings.
The offer is Is. a share. If the general
shareholders sell less than a 25 p.c.
interest, Mr Bowen will make up the
difference.
Generous as his decision may be, there
is more to it than meets the eye. In the
first place, he is virtually underwriting
the success of the merger. Second, he
no doubt wishes to maintain the connec-
tion between Consolidated and Earth-

Allied Expansion
Allied Mills Ltd is making a cash
and share offer worth £1.4 million
for Melbourne-based gluten supplier
Maize Products Pty Ltd. Directors of
Maize Products have recommended the
offer to shareholders.
The offer is: 20s. cash and one
Allied Mills ss. ordinary share for every
Maize Products 20s. share; 14s. cash and
one Allied Mills ss. share for every
Maize Products share paid to 14s. The
offer will cost Allied Mills £717,598
(equal to Maize’s paid capital) and will
involve the issue of 732,368 shares,
currently selling around the 17s. 9d.
mark.
Largest shareholder in Maize Products
is Macßobertson (Aust.) Ltd, confec-
tioner. Others include Brockhoffs Bis-
cuits, William Arnott, and James Sted-
man Sweets. There are also a number
of small private holdings. Maize Pro-
ducts’ profit last year fell from £105,322
to £92.479, equalling 12.9 p.c. on capital.
Bright Bells
prospectus from WA-based Bell
Bros confirms that the shares could
be well worth subscribing to. Earning
rate in the seven months to January was
running at an annual rate of 17.4 p.c.
However, as business rises considerably
in the final six months, the final result is
more likely to equal something like 20
p.c on capital. Current and future de-
mand for the company’s services is im-
posing great pressure. Asset backing for
the ss. shares is 7s. 9d., or 12s. if a
recent revaluation of plant is brought
into account.
Having regard to this bright position,
the dividend forecast of only 8 p.c. seems
rather discouraging. Yet the dividend
yield will be on a par with other recently
floated groups as the issue price for the

The low dividend, combined with the
current distaste for new floats, may have
brought about an undersubscription if the
company was based in the eastern States.

sure that the issue is more than filled.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Re-examination of IAC Holdings
Fairly attractive for the private investor
I last wrote about lAC
" Holdings Limited the shares were
selling at 13s. 3d. and I suggested that
they were probably fully priced. Today
they are selling at Bs. 9d. or 34 p.c. less,
so it will be interesting to see if they are
now a bargain. Certainly the current
dividend yield of 6.6 p.c. is quite attrac-
tive, though it must be remembered that,
at the bottom of the 1960 “shakeout”,
the price was Bs. 9d. and the dividend
yield was then 9.5 p.c. Admittedly, at
that time it looked as if the company
might not be able to claim interest paid
on new money raised as a tax deduction;
this would have meant that all the fin-
ance companies would have run into dif-
ficulties. Apart from this period the
shares had never fallen below 10s.
It is also fair to say that most of the
finance companies have suffered a simi-
lar fate, as the following table shows.

a backer have been included):

There could be considerable specula-
tion as to the reason or various reasons
for the present disenchantment with
finance companies. It is possible that the
continuing concern about the bad debt
experience could be part of the reasons.
While the general public may not as-
sociate any of the companies listed above
with the type of financing which has
brought problems to H. G. Palmer, Eric
Anderson, Marcus Clark and several
others, it is probably concerned that bad
debt experience may become general and
a normal hazard which cannot be avoid-
ed an the finance business. This is un-
doubtedly true, as the original Australian
financiers, the trading banks, know only
too well. Yet they also know that the in-
cidence can be reduced very substantial-
ly by careful selection of the risk in the
first place and a careful follow-up pro-
cedure to make sure that accounts do
not get into arrears without some ener-
getic action being taken to try to restore
the position. Nevertheless, it seems to me
that there is a good case for companies
engaged in consumer credit financing to
disclose the total amount of bad debts
actually written off during a year, as well
as the amount that has been transferred
to the provision for bad and doubtful
debts. So far as can be judged from the
published annual reports of lAC the
company does not even acknowledge the
possible existence of doubtful debts as
no reserve or provision is obvious.
In a most thoughtful paper delivered
to the first National Instalment Credit
Conference held in May, 1964, Mr C. W.
Fletcher drew attention to the change
which took place in the industry after
1953, when, as a result mainly of in-
creased competition, credit standards de-
clined and losses on repossessions in-
creased. Perhaps the most interesting
part of Mr Fletcher’s paper dealt with
the profitability break-up of a consumer
credit finance company. It will be in-
teresting to apply the method to lAC’s
accounts for a few years, with a view
to ascertaining the trends which may be
occurring.
IAC has clearly set out,
A in the directors’ reports for the last
five years, the net profit after tax which
has been derived from the finance group
as distinguished from the insurance
group. Although this means that some
estimation of tax is necessary to arrive
at the net profit before tax, this is a con-
siderable help in arriving at figures which
may be compared (albeit rather roughly)
with those given in Mr Fletcher’s paper.
If it is assumed that the tax provision
shown in the consolidated profit and loss
account should be divided proportionate-
ly between the finance group and the in-
surance group the figures for the finance
group will be as follows:
Year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
(£'000)
Net profit
after tax 1561 1536 1715 1810 1888
Tax 1032 1036 1025 969 1416
Interest 3166 3543 3891 4443 4884
Total 5759 6115 6631 7222 8188
Because I am unable to separate, to
my own satisfaction, the investments of
the insurance group from those of the
finance group, I have chosen to exclude
all investments from the figure for “net
outstandings”. As this raises an apparent
anomaly between 1960 and 1961 (when
outstandings seem to have declined by
approximately the amount by which in-
vestments increased), I have only cal-
culated the percentage of net profit be-
fore tax and interest for the last three
years. In broad terms, this percentage
seems to have been as follows:
1962 1963 1964
8.60 8.37 8.46
The apparent average interest charge
during this period seems to have been:
1962 1963 1964
6.95 6.81 6.67
These figures would suggest that, while
the return has declined, the cost of bor-
rowing has fallen even more. It would
also seem that the gearing has increased,
suggesting that the profitability of thq
finance group to the shareholders should
have increased quite noticeably.
As can be seen from the earning rate
to ordinary capital quoted under the
summary of the profit statements, this
has not been the case. It is almost certain
that this is due to the poor results which
have been achieved by the insurance
group. The factor in I AC’s favor seems
to be that it will need to increase out-
standings by another £lO million before
it will need to increase ordinary capital.
This would suggest that earnings can be
raised to the 1962-1963 levels, even if
the insurance profits stay at the 1964
level. Therefore, depending on the re-
sults from the insurance group, the earn-
ing rate could rise to somewhere between
19 p.c. and 21 p.c. before the next in-
crease in shareholders’ funds is needed.
At the price which the ANZ Bank paid
for its last issue of shares, 7s. 6d. per
share, the investment seems to be attrac-
tive, as the 7d. per share dividend is well
covered (and likely to remain so) and
provides a yield on the investment of
nearly 7.8 p.c. If an increase in the
dividend to six cents per share could be
expected with the introduction of decimal
currency and not another decrease (as
occurred with the bonus issue in 1962),
the shares are reasonably attractive to the
private investor who is looking for a
secure and high immediate income.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Ploughing into the Future
Fruitful expansion for Chamberlain
new or old ss. shares of Chamber-
lain Holdings Ltd look attractive
buying at 13s. at the moment. Any price
difference is accounted for by the fact
that the new shares do not -rank for
any final 1964-65 dividend, expected to
be 7+ p.c. or 4+d. Steady annual divi-
dends of 121 p.c. have been predicted
by the directors once all the capital
ranks equally. On this premise, current
prices would yield an investor about 5
p.c. from the distribution.
The new shares were created by the
recent three-for-five issue at 3s. pre-
mium. It raised £330,000 in capital and
£198,000 in premiums. The cash was
needed to finance a rapidly expanding
business mainly in the tractor imple--
ments and parts field. This was the
first issue to shareholders since listing
in February, 1963. The business has
expanded quickly ever since the pros-
pectus was first issued. Sales have risen
from £3,843,000 in 1961 to £4,963,000
in 1962, £5,382,000 in 1963 and
£6,410,000 last year.
The group is registered in WA. The
operating subsidiary, Chamberlain Indus-
tries Pty Ltd, was incorporated in 1946.
The third company forming the group
is Crusader Finance Pty Ltd. The basic
business is the manufacture and distribu-
tion of agricultural and industrial trac-
tors and agricultural equipment. There
is a factory at Welshpool and marketing
branches in all mainland States.
The share issue boosted paid capital
substantially from £550,000 to £BBO,OOO.
However, the highly profitable nature of
operations means that, despite this
increase, predicted dividends will still
be more than twice covered at the very
least. Earning rate last year was a
gigantic 53.6 p.c. after normal tax and
adequate depreciation. Although this rate
will undoubtedly come back in 1965-
66, it will not be long before rising
profits re-attain this level. The 1964-65
result, yet to be announced, will show
a big improvement on 53.6 p.c. if earn
ing rate is calculated on the steady divi-
dend-ranking capital.
Sales and profits for the first eight
months of 1964-65 have already been
reported as “appreciably” higher. In the
first six months of the year, turnover
and profit were reported as 20 p.c.
higher. A steady interim dividend of
5 p.c. has already been paid. The com-
pany has been enjoying the fruits of a
development programme.
Factory capacity was enlarged last
year and 37 acres in Welshpool were
acquired for future expansion. Unpre-
cedented demand has forced the group
to restrict export promotions. Despite
this, exports have been running at record
levels, one of the reasons being that
factory capacity was further expanded
during 1964-65.
One important factor bearing on the
group’s future is the current Tariff Board
hearings on protection for local tractor
manufacturers. Actually, Chamberlain is
not seeking direct protection, but a sub-
sidy. Directors believe a tariff would
be useless as it would boost selling
prices and, in any case, the local industry
is only producing about 40 p.c. of Aus-
tralian requirements. Because the terms
of the hearing require a statement of
the level of assistance sought, the com-
pany has had to request a 37i p.c.
British preferential tariff. However,
because these terms must be adhered to,
it cannot be assumed that the company
is seeking direct protection.
Although the Board’s findings are
awaited eagerly, it is unlikely that they
will have any. drastic long-term effects
on the group. At worst, one can expect
a slightly adverse decision as far as the
short term is concerned. This, combined
with the expected lowering of farm
incomes in the current year, could give
the group a lower 1965-66 profit. On
the other hand, a slightly favorable
finding (which appears very likely) could
offset the effect of these lower farm
incomes. Whatever the outcome, it ir

nothing much to worry shareholders.
Even with the higher capital now pre-
vailing, earning rates are running at
extremely buoyant levels. Profits would
have to fall by almost 75 p.c. before
the predicted dividend rate became
uncovered.
The accompanying table shows steady
growth in current assets and faster
growth in current liabilities, thus giving
a slow downward trend to working capi-
tal. The figure is nevertheless high. Fixed
assets reflect the rapid expansion already
mentioned, while intangibles are down
to healthy levels. The recent new issue
has put equity capital on a more
balanced basis. Reserves are high and
growing, offering promise of a bonus
issue in the years ahead.
The high level of loan capital is, of
course, the outstanding and worrying
factor. It represents a bank loan. For-
tunately, the high level of earnings will
enable a steady pay-back in future years
and the extremely high level of working
capital suggests that at least half the
loan could be paid off at will. In addi-
tion, the recent issue has improved the
group’s liquid position even further. It
also indicates a weakening in the lean-
ing toward loan capital. With expansion
still going on, further issues seem likely
in the not too distant future.
To sum up: The shares should be
good buying to hold for a year or
more. An increase in market price seems
likely in the near future and further
issues can be expected from the group
after another 12 months or so. There
is little doubt that a 12i p.c. dividend
will be paid on the higher capital.

COTTEE’S LTD
Impeccable
History
Shareholders of Cottee’s Ltd, Sydney-
based food and soft drink maker,
have been called on to provide more
funds for the company’s expansion.
Despite the premium placed on the issue
they have little to complain of as this
is the first call for funds in 10 years.
During this period they have received
two bonus share issues and 15 p.c. divi-
dends in each year.
Since listing, profit history has been
impeccable, with continual increases
always showing a considerable margin
over the dividend requirement, which
each year has been 15 p.c. on capital.
Shareholders have been called on for
funds in 1954 (one-for-three at par) and
1955 (23-for-100 at par). They have
since received a one-for-two bonus in
1959 and a one-for-four bonus in 1962.
The latest cash issue is on a one-for-eight
basis of ss. shares at 7s. 6d. premium;
it will lift paid-up capital to £710,000.
The AMP Society at last balance date
held £20,000 in preference capital, being
redeemed at the rate of £SOOO annually.
The company has developed in two
divisions—foodstuffs (which now makes
up about 60 p.c. of the turnover and
covers such lines as jam and fruit
spreads, jelly crystals, instant puddings,
packet soups, dried fruits, and more
recently frozen vegetables and poultry)
and aerated drinks, including frozen
orange juice.
However, the soft drinks are produced
by more than 80 franchise bottlers
throughout Australia, with the main con-
centration in the eastern States. If these
are included in turnover figures, business
would be split almost evenly between
drinks and foodstuffs.
The company was listed in 1952.
Although it now has more than 2000
shareholders, it is still very much a
family affair, with one of the original
founders, the present chairman Mr
H. W. Cottee, in active control.
The new funds are required to finance
several new developments. In particular
these involve the frozen food business,
which the company entered in 1961 by
the acquisition of Cahills Quick Freezers
Ltd. Since then directors have advanced
cautiously, knowing that one mistake in
this field could prove expensive and affect
the company’s reputation in other fields.
The initial testing period appears to
be over and expansion can now take on
a more rapid note. In addition, the com-
pany has also begun a new venture in
Fiji and wifi shortly start another in

Cottee’s now has plants in New
Guinea, Queensland, New South Wales
(2), Victoria (2), South Australia and
Western Australia. More than 150 mil-
lion bottles of soft drink under the
Cottee’s label are sold every year.
Despite “undiminished and skilful”
competition, profit last year was
£215,965, equal to 34.1 p.c. on capital,
compared with £209,281, equal to 33
p.c., in the previous year. Both profits
covered the ordinary dividend require-
ment more than twice.
The need for the latest issue is evident
when the gradual decline in working
capital during the past three years is
seen. Bank overdraft last year showed
a substantial rise, from £104,986 to
£294,478, while trade creditors were up
from £186,938 to £190,824. Long-term
mortgages and hire-purchase loans also
showed a sharp rise from £268,161 to
£321,497.
At the same time, trade debtors showed
a substantial rise from £392,913 to
£573,174, . while stocks rose from
£734,738 fo £777,296. Fixed assets con-
tinued to rise in keeping with the growth
of the company, last year increasing
from £1,766,804 to £3,245,942, prin-
cipally in plant items. )
The company, as a relative newcomer
to the soft drink industry in Sydney,
finds itself in a tough position against
the established competitor which has
large quantities of “cheap glass”. Coffee’s
has had to outlay large amounts on
bottles. Directors find these are slow
to return —the more successful you are
in selling the more you have tied up,
they explain. The situation may improve
if a hoped-for increase in the deposit on
bottles can be obtained.
Currently the ss. shares are selling a
little higher than 205., which could well
prove to be the lowest point for some
time. The company’s capital reserve
position is strong, quite capable of sup-
porting another bonus issue which the
high earning rate would have little
difficulty in servicing. The shares at
current prices are well worth locking
away for expected future benefits.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
The New Brokerage Rates
Investors should do some homework
‘’There are fairly rigid rules governing
direct advertising by sharebrokers.
(We've all seen those little boxes and the
numerous names that appear within
them.) But, of course, there are indirect
ways of getting one’s name before the
public.
It’s paradoxical that the public image
of the broker did not improve when the
rates of brokerage were adjusted this
week. The move almost went unnoticed
by that part of the financial Press which
had been so vocal in its criticism of the
rates earlier this year. Nevertheless, this
lack of comment is probably better than
Bob Sanders’ blunt statement on
‘‘People" that the increase in brokerage
rates was one v of the contributing factors
to the fall on the local market. A little
bit of homework beforehand would not
have gone astray.
As it is the investor who is paying
the brokerage, he should learn the relative
effect of the new 2 p.c. rate. Basically
it favors shares with a market value
under 21s. and goes against those over
that price. On a rough count there would
be four shares with a market value under
21s. to every one share over that price.
On this score the new rates are the more
attractive.
Let's take some specific examples:
1000 shares selling at Is.:
Under the old rates .... £4 3 4
Under the new rates .... £1 0 4)
1000 shares selling at 45.: v
Under the old rates £8 6 8
Under the new rates .... £4 0 0
1000 shares selling at 125.:
Under the old rates .... £l2 10 0
Under the new rates .... £l2 0 0
1000 shares selling at 405.:
Under the old rates .... £32 10 0
Under the new rates .... £4O 0 0
The new rates should certainly increase
trading in the lower - priced shares.
Before, such a share (or right) had to
rise as much as 10 p.c. before a profit
was showing; now it need only be 2 p.c.
The new rates had quite an influence
on my first transaction. It was the sale
of 1000 Steamships rights at 25., where,
instead of paying £4 3s. 4d., the broker-
age was only £2. I was just \not in the
position to take up 3000 rights. As it is,
the 2000 will set me back £750.
Thus funds became an urgent neces-
sity. First of all I decided to get rid
of the MLC at 655. All those put options
have put the skids under the shares,
making them dangerous holding in the
short' term. I still think long-term in-
vestors would go a long way before they
could find a stock of this calibre at this
price.
The loss on MLC was more than
recovered by the £36 profit on the 1000
Eglo. The last sale was Ferris Industries,
a share that showed no life during its
stay in the portfolio.
The final move for the week was the
purchase of 200 AOG at 235. Behind
all the excitement on the industrial mar-
ket was a welcome firming in most of
the oil stocks. Perhaps we have reached
the long-hoped-for halt in the downtrend
of oil shares Unperturbed by the fall
in the share price in the last three years,
AOG has continued with its drilling pro-
gramme around the Meonie area.
Transactions for the week were:

1000 Steamships rights, 2/- £9B

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Wisdom of Solomon?
Interpretations of the poultry levy
rpHE Council of Egg Marketing Authori-
ties (CEMA) plan for the stabilisation
of the poultry industry is now the law
of the land. The Poultry Industry Levy
Act rules that, broadly speaking, an
owner of more than 20 hens (over six
months of age) must pay a levy of about
seven shillings a year on each bird in
excess of the 20.
If you imagine that this means plain
sailing in the troubled poultry industry
you are wide of the mark. Already some
loopholes have appeared in what was
intended as a watertight plan to force
all egg producers under control of the
Egg Boards.
The Act refers consistently to “com-
mercial egg producers”. This, one would
imagine, would mean an egg producer
who sells eggs. How else could you be
a commercial egg producer? Well, the
Egg Boards do not see it that way at all.
It is a very naive assumption that to be
a commercial egg producer you must self
eggs.
The Victorian Egg Board has given a
ruling that, in its interpretation, the Act
means that anyone with more than 20
hens, whether they sell eggs or not, is
a commercial producer. The State
opinion is very important because, under
this most remarkable piece of legislation,
the States still retain their rights.
Well, you might not like it if you run
40 fowls on the farm. But you might
concede that, in the interests of orderly
marketing, the Egg Board is entitled to
give an interpretation of a Common-
wealth Act. Fine. Then all you have
to do to claim extensive taxation benefits
as a commercial poultry farmer is to
keep 21 fowls and pay the levy on one
of them.
Normally the Taxation Department
would not be impressed. Yet here you
have a Commonwealth Act of Parlia-
ment which says you are a commercial
egg producer even though you may
engage in no commercial activity whatso-
ever in connection with eggs.
It gets better yet. As well as the new
Commonwealth Act there are still the
existing State laws relating to the market-
ing of eggs. The Commonwealth Act in
no way supplants the existing State Acts.
So —in the case of Victoria anyway
—the Egg Board has two marketing Acts
going for it at the same time.
The old law, in Victoria, says that
if you have more than 40 hens you must
sell eggs through the Egg Board. If
you have less than 40 you may sell
them anywhere, without registering with
the Board, and you are not considered
to be a commercial producer.
Well, you are and you are not. The
Commonwealth Act says you are; the
State law says you are not.
With the wisdom of Solomon the Vic-
torian Egg Board has arrived at a ruling
on this, too. It has a bit of each Act.
If you have, for the sake of argument,
30 hens, you pay the Commonwealth
levy on ten of them but you can still
do what you like with the eggs give
them away, eat them yourself, or sell
them to a friend. Over 40 hens and you
pay both the hen levy and you must
channel eggs through the Egg Board.
There is a funny side to all this, but
there is a principle, too. All during the
period in which CEMA was being

formulated it was generally accepted
that non-commercial owners of fowls
would be exempted. The chairman of
CEMA, Colonel M. McArthur, even
made a Press statement to the effect that
“backyarders” would be exempted from
the levy.
It might not be his fault, of course,
that the Act turned out to be something
quite different. It would not be the first
time that the chairman of a committee,
deciding something for a primary in-
dustry, has found that the Common-
wealth Government has its own ideas on
the wording of an Act. But the point
of principle is that- had the definition
of commercial producer been clarified
before the CEMA plan became law, then
opposition to CEMA during the planning
stage would have been much stronger.
It does not merely involve people who
keep fowls in their backyard. There are
many institutions—schools, homes, con-
vents and so on (some of them with
powerful friends) which keep large
flocks of fowls to supply their own
people, whether they be orphans or old
people or inmates or what have you.
None of these institutions had any idea
that they would have to pay the hen
levy. They were told, specifically, just
the opposite.
Another quite grave discrepancy over
CEMA has also come to light now that
the ball is over. Both f he CEMA people
themselves and the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr Adermann, said that a
referendum of growers was not necessary
to implement CEMA because fully 75
p.c. of growers marketed eggs through
Egg Boards and thus supported the
CEMA organisations, which stemmed
from the Egg Boards. The plan was
necessary to curb the activities of the
“interstaters” who operated outside Egg
Board control and who paid nothing
towards minimising the “export loss” on
eggs. At most, it was said, they
amounted to 25 p.c. of the industry.
Yet the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, a Commonwealth Govern-
ment instrumentality, has put the figure
of producers outside Egg Board control
in Australia as high as 50 p.c. Both
figures can hardly be correct.
No wonder the Egg Boards did not
want a referendum. Had there been one
they would, quite likely, have been out
of business, going on the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics figure.
In any case the bush lawyers have
been quick to point out that “export
loss” is a convenient way of describing
a non-profit export industry in eggs
which is maintained, by Egg Boards,
mainly as a device to give the Common-
wealth power over marketing.
How can eggs which are sold at a
loss overseas constitute a genuine export
industry? If eggs were not exported the
Commonwealth could not enter into
marketing under Section 92.
There can be sympathy with the plan-
ners, up to a point. The chronic til
affecting the poultry industry is over-
production. Typically, though, no one
seems to have considered seriously the
possibility of cheaper eggs as a corrective
measure. The concern has been to
extend the protecting arm to a great
number of producers who, in many cases,
are inefficient and ill-equipped, and who,
in any case, will not be protected in the
long run.
The next step, sure as eggs, will be
the issuing of contracts by Egg Boards
to large, heavily capitalised producers
who can supply specific quantities of
eggs at specific times of the year. If
you cannot beat them you must join
them. As soon as these mammoth egg
factories start making shares available
(like Golden Poultry in the broiler field),
then buy them. Not only will these egg
factory concerns have the laws of
economics on their side; they also will
have the built-in insurance of Egg Boards
able to say who, and who shall not, be
permitted to supply eggs.
Until this happens, however, it will
be interesting to see if someone has a
shot at challenging, in court, the interpre-
tations of the Poultry Industry Levy
Act. Such a person would need much
courage and much cash. How often
have Australian courts ruled against the
Government?

Wool Futures and Reserve Price
Crystal-clear explanations required
fFHE suggestion that greater use of the
wool futures market is better, from
the woolgrowers’ point of view, than
the controversial reserve price plan is
one of those things which are all right in
theory but difficult to see happening in
practice. As this is exactly how the
chairman of the Sydney Greasy Wool
Futures Exchange describes the reserve
price proposal, we have a paradox.
The great majority of woolgrowers,
v/ho could be assumed to know more
than anyone else about their industry,
actually appear to know very little about
futures. Woolgrowers have had many
opportunities to use futures to hedge
their clip against a fall in price. Their
attitude, in the main, has been to stay
away. It is estimated that 85 p.c. of
the people trading in futures are not
woolgrowers at all, but city-based specu-
lators.
This alone might not be a true reflec-
tion of the position, as the speculator is
an integral part of any futures trading.
Nevertheless the general contention, that
few actual woolgrowers use futures, is
correct.
Now, if futures trading is to become an
alternative to the reserve price scheme,
it must be extended to all woolgrowers.
Whatever its opponents may say about
it the reserve price plan does embrace all
woolgrowers. The opponents of the
plan must therefore offer something
better.
A really vigorous educational pro-
gramme may.be necessary to convince
woolgrowers that they can use futures
to hedge. There has been some of this
already, of course. The reason wool-
growers have failed to get the message
may be psychological.
The woolgrower, to get benefit from
futures, would of necessity have to
exercise his own brains and his own
time (even if he works through an agent),
whereas with reserve price all this is
done for him by the marketing authority
over which, it is true, the Government
must have some control. The wool-
grower, naturally, will have his share of
the control also, through his appointed
representatives, and it is altogether false
to consider the reserve price scheme in
terms of reserve price only.
There is a grand design inherent in
it. The remarkable thing is that the
opponents of the scheme appear to
believe that in pointing to this grand
design they are discovering some extra-
ordinary, hidden defect in the plan. To
the pro-reservists the grand design is,
and always has been, that the initiative
in determining the prices for wool shall
be removed from the broker, the buyer,
indeed all outside influences, and placed
firmly in the hands of the woolgrower.
The woolgrower who favors reserve
price does so accepting that it will mean
far 'greater control of the industry
generally for him.
Now, conceding that futures could
act as a price protection mechanism as
claimed, it would still leave the initiative
with somebody else. That is not what
the reserve price woolgrower wants. Yet
could futures act in this way?
This is a good question because using
futures as an alternative to reserve price
would entail 99 p.c. of woolgrowers
hedging 99 p.c. of the clip through the
futures market. Would this not mean,
simply, that 99 p.c. of wool would be
sold now, for delivery later, and that
futures would become a forward selling
market? This being so, would not the
Government, or a grower cum Govern-
ment bidding authority, have to enter
into futures bidding in order to ensure
that all contracts offered found takers?

Roomier than any car near the price
Alive with driving excitement
(try it and discover the difference!)
Picture the all-new Holden in any beautiful
setting . . . you’ll see that with its curved, years-
ahead styling it belongs there naturally. And it
seems even more beautiful when you appreciate
the practical reasons for its new shape. Curved
doors and windows make Holden roomier than
any car near the price. They give you an extra
5 inches of shoulder room and almost as much
extra hiproom. With your choice of 3 engines up
to the fiery 140-hp X 2, it’s alive with driving
excitement. You get sparkling acceleration and
hill-climb ability, and the kind of swift, smooth
highway cruising which reminds you of cars that
cost hundreds of pounds more. Drive Holden
soon, and really journey to faraway places!
