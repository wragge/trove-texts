The RED PAGE
A. C. S.
The passing of Swinburne removed the
last of the major poets of the Victorian
era and the greatest metrical magician of
his time. In a period when Browning
and Tennyson were still at their best,
Swinburne transcended all their efforts
as an artist in verse. He made old
metres more beautiful and added new
measures and new beauty to the already
rich store of English literature. His
poetry is not charged with any purpose
or message; he sang for the joy of
singing, and the songs came from
a superabundance of poetical emotions
through a lyrical faculty of the finest
quality. It is as an artist that he
has won the high position his work
now occupies. It is true that there is
no hard core of thought in his verse—
which to many readers is an essential ; but
style, not subject, has so far proved to
be the best preservative against decay, and
there is every reason to believe that some
of Swinburne’s poetry will last while the
language lasts. What position his name
will ultimately take on the long roll of
English poets it is, of course, impossible
to say ; but from the standpoint of to-
day it is difficult to imagine that the
inventor of such matchless harmonies
should not occupy a place amongst the
highest.
His outward life was uneventful. Born
in London on the stli April, 1837,
he was just over 72 when he
died. The son of an Admiral and an
Earl’s daughter, descendant of ancient
families on both sides, he began with
many advantages. He went to Eton
and Oxford, became acquainted with
most of the best men of his generation,
lived in Italy, had a gay time in London
for a while, and spent the last thirty years
in retirement at Putney with Theodore
W atts-Dunton.
Swinburne had published three volumes
before any but a few keen watchers of
the literary skies discerned his brilliance.
Then came the wonderful first series of
Poems and Ballads , which placed him at
one bound in the first rank, and spread
his fame far and wide. They were veritable
“magic casements opening on the foam of
perilous seas,” not, however, “in faery
lands forlorn,” but in the sunny lands of
Prance, the region of the Renaissance
and the world of sense known to Catullus
and Sappho. Subjects which the British
Young Person was not supposed to
read about were handled with all the
extravagance of youth and with all the
charm of surpassing lyrical genius.
The Times reviewer, Dallas, who had
received an early copy, considered it
highly immoral, and issued an ulti-
matum to Moxon, the publisher, that if
the book were not withdrawn he would
denounce it and destroy it. The book
was withdrawn, and Swinburne immedi-
ately afterwards published it himself
through Hotten. It evoked an amazing
outburst of hostile criticism, one of the
most remarkable in literary history.
It was a long time before the Philistines
recovered from the shock, and in .the
meantime Swinburne published volume
after volume, and thoroughly exemplified
his complete mastery of every form of
English, and considerable skill in French,
Latin and Greek verse. A new genera-
tion sprang up which knew not the
Josephs of the British press, but read
Swinburne with delight, and proclaimed
his superiority with force and enthusiasm.
By the time Tennyson died there /was
hardly a dissentient critical voice as to
the next greatest poet in England.
Swinburne’s prose work, with the ex-
ception of a few pamphlets, is entirely
devoted to literature, and exhibits the
same characteristics of extravagance and
impetuosity as his verse. In his scornful
reply to the reviewers of Poems and
Ballads he said: “I have never been
able to see what should attract men
to the profession of criticism but
the noble pleasure of praising.” He
acted on that principle himself, only
occasionally stepping aside to wither and
blast some object of his wrath. One
might think that nothing more could be
said in the way of eulogy than was said
in his essay on Rossetti, but a few pages
further on Morris and Matthew Arnold
receive as liberal and varied bounty of
adjectives, and all of these were as no-
thing to the gorgeous tributes laid
reverently at the feet of Victor Hugo.
The extraordinary extent of Swin-
burne’s knowledge of literature, his
prodigious and exact memory, and his ex-
quisitive taste, make his criticism valuable
in spite of its intemperance; and there is a
noble eloquence and rhythmic movement
in some of his prose which render it
attractive for its own sake.
The prose may be disregarded, the
dramas pitched overboard, and Poems and
Ballads alone would be a sufficient pass-
port to posterity. Almost every phase of
Swinburne’s genius is illustrated there ;
but a selection from all his lyrics added
to the whole of Atalanta (making such a
volume as William Sharp edited for the
Tauchnitz Library) would give the cream
of Swinburne, and contain probably all
that posterity will care to preserve.
Swinburniana
TO STRUGGLE WHEN HOPE IS
BANISHED.
To struggle when hope is banished ; »
To live when life’s salt is gone ;
To dwell in a dream that’s vanished ;
To endure and go calmly on ;
To know and to doubt the knowledge ;
The past to undo in thought;
To study in Misery’s college
The woes that can there be taught;
Oh ! what but despair can finish
A task such as that for man?
His strength will each hour diminish
While pressed by so heavy a ban.
But, no ! The heart steeped in sorrow
Still points to a distant goal.
And whispers “There comes a morrow
With peace to the steadfast soul! ”
A peace that is based on duty,
The will and the power to think,
Can carry, unscathed in beauty,
The brave where, the feeble sink.
At need, then, is help the nighest:
Where the storm is fiercest, there
The courage must still be highest.
To act—to resist —to bear.
A. C. S., aged 12 (in Frazer's Maga., May, 181/9),
William Bell Scott Autobiographical
Rotess
Swinburne, at this time about eighteen,
had got a prize for French, which made him
childishly proud, and, indeed, made him all
his life delighted with that tongue. . . . This
was, I think, the only success he made at
school or college, which none of his intimate
friends could fathom, as he was able to
acquire without trouble, and had a memory
enabling him to recite long poems by once
reading. When he began to write poetry,
which he was always fond of reciting, he
never needed to carry his manuscript about
with him !
A few days after my first meeting him he
appeared with the prize-book, entering the
saloon where we were all at work hopping
on one foot, his favorite expression of
extreme delight. It was a large edition of
Notre Dame de Paris, gorgeously bound,
with illustrations by Tony Johannot; but
the exuberance of his delight was so comical
that even Lady Trevelyan could not resist a
smile, and Miss Capel Lofft, a very nervous
person, begged him to sit down-quietly and
show her the prints. . . . The whole fore-
noon that book was never out of his sight.
If it lay on the table, his eyes were always
wandering to it. The fascination of first
love was nothing to this fascination; and
when we all adjourned for an interval to the
garden, there it was, tightly held under his
arm, while he ran on before backwards and
ran back to us again, and the sharpest of
eyes were fixed on him with their amused
but maternal expression. Can it have been
that this school prize-book, the Notre Dame
de Paris, made Victor Hugo his hero for life 1
Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones, by
Lady G.B.J.
Swinburne was the next remarkable person-
ality I remember in these days [lB6o] ; he had
rooms very near us, and we saw a great deal
of him ; sometimes twice or three times in a
day' he would come in, bringing his poems
hot from his heart, and certain of welcome
and a hearing at any hour. His appearance
was very unusual and in some ways beauti-
ful, for his hair was glorious in abundance
and color and his eyes indescribably fine.
When repeating poetry he had a perfectly
natural way of lifting them in a rapt, uncon-
scious gaze, and their clear green color,
softened by thick brown eyelashes, was un-
forgettable : “ Looks commercing with the
skies,” expresses it without exaggeration.
He was restless beyond words, scarcely
standing still at all, and almost dancing
as he walked, while even in sit-
ting he moved continually, seeming to
keep time, by a swift movement of the
hands at the wrists, and sometimes of the
feet also, with some inner rhythm of excite-
ment. He was courteous and affectionate,
and unsuspicious, and faithful beyond most
people to those he really loved. The biting
wit which filled his talk so as at times to
leave his hearers dumb with amazement
always spared one thing, and that was an
absent friend.
There was one subject which in these days
he raised our hopes that he might deal with ;
but the time passed, and now we shall never
see his proposed diary of Mrs. Samuel Pepys
kept concurrently with that of her husband.
H. T. Dunn -Recollections of D. G.
Rossettis
Dunn describes a visit Swinburne paid to
the house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where
Rossetti was then living. A thunderstorm
commenced as the poet entered in the twi-
light ; Rossetti was absent, so he strode up
and down the room and began reciting verses
aloud. The storm became violent, and vivid
flashes of lightning were frequent—“ Swin-
burne became more excited and burst into a
torrent of splendid verse which continued
for some time, each flash of lightning reveal-
ing him as one inspired, his wealth of hair
giving forth a scintillation of tiny electric
sparks which formed, as it were, a faint halo
round his head.” While Dunn was wonder-
ing how long this marvellous outburst would
last, Rossetti came in, lit the gas, and began
a talk which lasted till morning.
Personalia by “Sigma”
I received a note from Howell asking me
to lunch with him to meet “ the poet,” as
he invariably styled Mr. Swinburne, an in-
vitation which I readily enough accepted. It
was a memorable occasion. Mr. Swinburne
did not arrive till lunch was over, and, before
entering the house, was engaged in a pro-
longed difference with his cabman, who
eventually snatched up his reins and drove
rapidly off as if glad to get away. “The
poet’s got the best of it, as usual,” drawled
Howell (who had been gleefully watch-
ing the scene). “He lives at the
British Hotel in Cockspur-street, and never
goes anywhere except in hansoms, which,
whatever the distance, he invariably remu-
nerates with one shilling. Consequently
when, as to-day, it’s a case of two miles beyond
the radius, there’s the Devil’s own row ; but
in the matter of imprecation the poet is more
than a match for cabby, who, after tive
minutes of it, gallops off as though he had
been rated by Beelzebub himself!” Here,
looking, it must be owned, singularly inno-
cent of anathema, Mr. Swinburne, entered,
and, being fortunately in one of his charac-
teristic veins, provided me with the most in-
teresting hour of my existence.
Unlike many of his craft, Mr. Swinburne,
who had j ust read Miss Rossetti’s ‘ ‘ Goblin
Market, and other Poems,” recently pub-
lished, showed the most generous enthusiasm
for the work of his fellow-poet, and, after
paying her a signal tribute, he asked Howell
if he happened to have the volume in the
house. Fortunately this proved to be the
case, and Mr. Swinburne, taking up the
book, rapidly turned over the pages, evi-
dently in search of some favorite poem. . . .
His quest stopped almost at the end of the
book, and without more ado he straightway
proceeded to read aloud that singularly beau-
tiful but profoundly devotional paraphrase,
partly derived from Solomon’s Song, which
begins with ‘ ‘ Passing away, saith the world,
passing away.” The particular metre and
impressive monotony of rhyme (every line
in the piece is rhymed to the opening one)
seemed peculiarly to lend themselve's to Mr.
Swinburne’s measured lilt of intonation, and
I then realised for the first time the almost
magical effect which Tennyson’s similar
method of reading was wont to exercise over
his hearers. When Mr. Swinburne had
finished, he put the book down with a
vehement gesture, but only for an instant.
After a moment’s pause he took it up again,
and a second time read the poem aloud with
even greater expression than before. “By
God ! ” he said, as he closed the book,
‘ ‘ that’s one of the finest things ever written! ”
He then proceeded to touch on a variety of
subjects, all with the greatest fervor and
vehemence. At that time he appeared to
have a sovereign disdain for Tennyson,
whose poetry he attacked wholesale with
almost frenzied bitterness, quoting, I remem-
ber, with peculiar gusto Bulwer Lytton’s
diatribe against him in “ The New Timon.”
With the courage of extreme youth (I was
not eighteen) I actually ventured to inter-
pose a plea for one favorite, at least.
“Surely, Mr. Swinburne,” I faltered, “you
will except ‘Maud’?” “Well, sir,” he
courteously replied, ‘ ‘ I think you are right;
I ought to have excepted ‘ Maud,’ for it cer-
tainly does contain some fine things.”
W. M. Rossetti—Rossetti Papers
Went down at Swinburne’s invitation to
visit his father at Holm wood. . . . Swinburne
shows well at home, being affectionate in his
manner with all the family. . . . The Swin-
burne family generally have Algernon’s
passion for cats. (January, 1867.)
Swinburne says that he received yesterday,
to his unspeakable satisfaction, a letter from
Mazzini, consequent upon his (Swinburne’s,
poem on the Cretan insurrection. (March)
1867.)
Scott says that Swinburne, being at Karl
Blind’s, the other evening, met Mazzini per-
sonally for the first time. M. walked straight
up to Swinburne, who fell on his knee before
him and kissed his hand. (April, 1867).
S. called—full of his interviews with
Mazzini. . . . S. speaks of Mazzini’s im-
mense magnetic power, which he feels opera-
ting upon him apart from the enthusiasm
which he entertains for his character.
Mazzini urges him much to write poems
with a directly democratic or humanitarian
aim, which S. finds it difficult to shirk, at
the same time that he feels conscious that it
is not exactly his line, and would not pro-
mote his true poetic development. (May,
1867.)
Brown [Ford Madox] says that the recent
invitation to Swinburne to stand for Parlia-
ment came from the Reform League, was
declined by S. on the express advice of
Mazzini. (Oct., 1868.)
S. considers Matthew Arnold more satis-
factory as a poetic writer than either Brown-
ing or Tennyson.
S. came back from his friend Powell’s at
Etreat: was nearly drowned there one day,
which happened to be the equinoctial tide,
when he had gone out swimming. Had to
swim on some three miles, the sea carrying
him irresistibly out—till at last a fishing-
boat picked him up. Says he felt no com-
punctions or religious impressions in the
prospect of death. (Nov., 1868.) [This
episode is referred to in Ex Fbto.]
Victor Hugo received very graciously the
article which S. wrote upon L’Homme qui
Rif, and has expressed a very high opinion
of the French lyrics scattered among Swin-
burne’s poems. S. objects much to Gabriel’s
continual revising of his old poems.
His beautiful Angora cat, given him by
Mazzini—white with a tabby tail—died
lately. It used to sit on his head while he
was writing. (Sept., 1869.)
W. M. Rossetti, in his Reminiscence s:
In 1868 Mr. Legros exhibited in the Royal
Academy an excellent picture —The, Refectory.
There was a tabby cat painted in the picture.
In that year was published a pamphlet of
Notes on the Art of the season ; Mr. Swin-
burne wrote one section of it and I the other,
and S. referred to the “ splendid cat.” ... In
1895 I had occasion to look at this painting in
the house of the heir of the original purchaser.
To my surprise, the cat had disappeared.
“ Why,” said I, “ there used to be a cat in
that corner of the picture.” “ Yes,” replied
the owner, “but my predecessor, on seeing
that Swinburne had found a good word to
say for the cat, got her obliterated forth-
with.” Such was the feeling of the enlight-
ened British world for Poems and Ballads
and the author thereof.
FROM “THALASSIUS.”
“ Child of my sunlight and the sea, from birth
A fosterling and fugitive on earth ;
Sleepless of soul as wind or yvave or fire,
A manchild with an ungrown god’s desire ;
Because thou hast loved nought mortal more
than me,
Thy father, and thy mother-hearted sea ;
Because thou hast set thine heart to sing, and sold
Life and life’s love for song, God’s living gold ;
Because thou hast given thy flower and fire of
youth
To feed men’s hearts with visions, truer than truth;
Because thou has kept in those world-wandering
eyes
The light that makes me music of the skies ;
Because thou hast heard with world-unwearied
ears
The music that puts light into the spheres;
Have therefore in thine heart and in thy mouth
The sound of song that m-kigles north and south,
The song of all the winds that sing of me,
And in thy soul the sense of all the sea.”

PROSTRATION.
A Marvellous Cure.
Thirty-one years have elapsed since Mrs. Ann
Griffiths, of No. 2 Garden Avenue, Glebe, came
to this country from Shropshire, and five years
since the experiences contained in this report were
encountered. “I could hardly crawl along,” Mrs.
Griffiths went on to explain to our representative.
“I was so terribly weak, and the whole of my
physical misfortunes arose through bad digestion,
so it is a more important matter than most people
think. For months previously, I had been right
off my food, and I was kept back by the fact that
I was unable to get my rest. Then I discovered
what a dreadful thing it is to have nerves that are
unhinged, for mine certainly were. Why, if a
person spoke to me at all unexpectedly, I would
almost jump out of my skin, and if I happened to
be walking along the street I would be in con-
tinual fear of being run over. Good gracious! how
I used to start if anything dropped on the floor;
but this was not the worst feature of my nervous
breakdown. I was for ever dreading something
that I knew not what. Somebody was going to
die, or be injured, Or a fire was going to take place,
and I couldn’t get these ideas out of my head, no
matter how I tried. In bed at night I would find
myself fairly shaking, with perspiration breaking
out upon me, and I would be afraid to move. I
was full of trouble and felt as if I were gradually
sinking into my grave. A suffocating sensation
in my chest, acute aches down my back, a vile
taste in my mouth, and a tongue white with fur—
those were some of the symptoms that showed I
was not in good health, but the falling-off in my
weight was more eloquent testimony still.”
“What weight were you prior to your illness?”
“ Fourteen stone—a big weight for a woman—
but I got down considerably. Indeed you wouldn’t
have known me, I was so pale and thin, and it
wasn’t because I didn’t try to get well, Heaven
knows ; for I tried all manner of things without
any good resulting. I suffered most unmercifully
from headaches and giddy feelings, and was aw-
fully despondent at not getting relief from the
physics I had taken. I used to wonder what to try
next, and presently I struck the idea of buying some
Clements Tonic. Well, I could not have expected
so much as I realised from that medicine, though
-from what I knew of that remedy beforehand, it
is a wonder I did not use it earlier, only the pre-
vious experience was in an entirely different case,
about which I’ll tell you. In my case, though.
Clements Tonic was wonderful, it strengthened
me throughout and cured my indigestion, even
when all else failed. But its effect on my son
may reasonably be regarded as one of the wonders
of the age. When a child, he received a great
shock, which gave him St. Vitus’ dance. He was
treated at the hospital, and took no end of medi-
cine. Poor chap ! he was almost demented, and
hardly able to walk. It was pitiful to see him
quivering in every nerve, hardly able to drag one
leg after the other, with fearfully hideous nights
in front of him always—no sleep very often, and
when there was, dreams that made him call out—
a poor appetite and weak digestion; really no-
thing but a shattered wreck that would bring
tears to one’s eyes almost to look at. And he was
like that for years, with never a hope of being
cured, as the doctors could do nothing for him, yet
Clements Tonic set him up and made him so
active, and as sound as any man in Sydney.
People marvelled to see him cured, and anyone
about here will corroborate what I have said.”
“They can see your statements in print ? ”
“ The whole world should know what Clements
Tonic can do for suffering humanity, and I am
only delighted to be able to tell you what that
remedy has done for me and mine. And you can
form an idea of what a mother's gratitude should
be, and is, when she has had her son transformed
from a tottering, quivering cripple to a lithe-limb-
ed, sound and robust man. Yes, publish this
news throughout the land in any manner you
desire.”

The Three-Horse ’Bus.
Electric-trams are as dull as prose
And motors fume and fuss,
Now only wraiths of the old steam-trams
Chase ghosts of the three-horse ’bus ;
She was never too full nor too proud to stop
When a fare by the way was spied,
There was always a bit of a squeeze on top,
But “ Room for one inside ! ”
The near-side horse was a cunning rough
That loafed on the pole all day.
But the leader was always a grafter tough
As ever chewed lucerne-hay ;
He’d learnt his trade on the racing-track,
And he jostled the snorting trams
With a heaving flank and an arching back
And wet and quivering hams.
It was “ Room on top ! ” at the Queen-street bend
Where the track is clear and wide.
But from Regent-street to the gaol-walls’ end
It was only “ Room inside ! ”
She was never so full but she found a seat
For the damsel walking down ;
She lurched like a tramp into Oxford-street,
And romped through the streets up-town.
Was she late by a minute at Barrack Hill,
Oh, how did the team stampede !
When the driver flicked at the leader’s ears
And the wheelers earned their feed,
A motor behind with a reeking fire
And a shrill impatient squeal,
And a rail was gripping a hind-wheel tyre,
And a cyclist hugging a wheel 1
She swept past the gaol with a daring swerve
To the swingle-tree’s refrain,
Where the steel tracks cross at the Randwick curve
You could feel the traces strain ;
When the leader rattled his well-shod heels
On the steps of a crossing tram.
And the brakes came down on the two hind wheels
When a lorry tried to ram.
She bumped like a dray at the Crown-street rails
And swung down the hill wrong side—
As the hoof-beats rang on the greasy blocks
There was grit in the leader’s stride ;
Till she pulled up, jambed by a winded dray,
And locked to an Irish car,
And the polers plunged as the leader swerved,
With his nose in the Cambridge bar.
He’d need some nerve who would tool a ’bus
From the gaol to the Hyde Park turn,
With a horse’s nose in each window-pane,
And a motor close astern.
And the whole street tearing like fiends from
Hell,
Till the top-fares held their breath,
As the leader dashed for a closing gap
That yawned in the Street of Death !
Electric cars are as dull as prose,
And motors fume and fuss,
But this is a song of the old steam-tram
And the good old three-horse ’bus ;
She was never too fast nor too full to stop
When a fare by the way was spied,
It was always “Full as a tick on top ! ”
And “ Lots of room inside ! ”

Never yearnin’ sideways, never dreamin’ back,

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to Tim Bulletin -would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The 'Editor, Bullutin.” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of

acknowledge in the “Correspondence” column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,

(those dealing with A ustralian subjects, and not exceeding
twc columns in length, or, say, 5000 ivords, are specially

All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
This Bullutin will return all unsuitable MS. when the

are observed. When MS. is forwarded, without stamps
for return it ivill be understood that the copy is to be

stand that it is not responsible for the preservation or

TASMANIA THINKS OF REFORMING
Tasmania has an election at the end of this month,
and its progressive elements will seize the oppor-
tunity to make another effort to galvanise the
corpse of a dead island into life and activity. *
There is no reason why Tasmania should be dead,
save the fact that an Upper House of dull, pompous
and utterly selfish property-holders, with an
average intelligence about equal to that of the
beasts which perish, prevents all progress, and sits
like the dead weight of very much mud on the
public chest. Everything that Providence could
be reasonably expected to do for a country
it did for Tasmania. It gave the isle a
regular rainfall such as no other State of
the Commonwealth possesses. In N.S.W.,
Queensland, South Australia, Westralia, and even
(to a small extent) in the Northern Territory
there are areas with less than lOin. of annual
rainfall—as a matter of fact, nearly five-sixths of
S.A. and nearly half of Westralia have less than
lOin. of rain per annum. Tasmania has no
land with less than lOin. of rain per annum. More
than half of N.S.W. and Queensland, nearly
half of Victoria, almost all S.A. and Westralia,
and rather over one-third of the Northern
Territory have less than 20in. of yearly rainfall.
Tasmania has no land with less than 20in. of
yearly rainfall. The island has a cool climate,
and all the Tories who allege that the white man
can’t live and work in the tropics hold
that a cool climate is a great asset —even
a stupendous asset. Its land is fertile; in
the quantity of oats, wheat, barley, hay and pota-
toes which it yields per acre, where the big landlord
allows the acre to be cultivated, it beats every State
on the Australian mainland. Providence gave it
so much mineral wealth that its annual production
of gold, etc., per inhabitant far exceeds in
value that of Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria or
South Australia. And yet Tasmania is dead—so
dead that its cleadness is a joke and its corpse is a
thing of mirth, like that of Jehoiakim, who was
“ buried with the burial of an ass,” as mentioned
by that eminent weeper, the prophet J eremiah.
* * * *
Tasmania’s stagnation cannot be set down to
over-population. It has about seven people to
the square mile, which is far below the figure of
either Victoria or Maoriland. And if the popula-
tion is reckoned as per square mile of territory
with over 20in. of rainfall—that is to say, as so
many people to every naturally fertile and easily-
habitable square mile—Tasmania is less thickly
peopled than New South Wales, and very far less
thickly peopled than South Australia, while com-
pared to Victoria it ranks as a howling wilderness
of depopulation. According to the fertility and
carrying capacity of the country, there is hardly
any place on earth, barring Queensland and the
Northern Territory, that is emptier than Tas-
mania. Yet it is the second oldest white settle-
ment in Australia, and its people were digging
and ploughing and multiplying and accumulating
wealth, so far as their backward Tory Govern-
ment would allow them to accumulate anything,
before Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, or
Westraha were heard of. Considering the long start
which Tasmania had of all the other States save
only New South Wales, and taking into account
its climate, its regular rainfall, its fertility, its
amazing mineral wealth, its forests and fisheries,
the fine harbors which Nature supplied to give its
commerce a leg-up, and all its other advantages,
it is impossible to suppose that anything save
utterly incapable government is responsible for
its present stagnation.
•* • * *
Tasmania, when last heard of, had a population
of about 180,000. If it was as thickly peopled as
the younger and far less fertile State of Victoria,
it would have about 375,000 people. If it was as
thickly peopled as the much less fertile country of
Belgium, it would have nearly 18,000,000 ; but
Belgium is an abnormal case and a sort of side
issue, and need hardly be considered in this con-
nection. Tasmania, because the Lord made it a
healthy country, has the largest growth of popu-
lation by excess of births over deaths in the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth. But because man, mostly
in the shape of the Upper House, made Tasmania
such a very good place to get out of, ana because, as
a natural consequence, the great ambition of every
enterprising Tasmanian has been to get away from
his native isle, the rate of increase in its population
is less than half the average of the Australian main-
land. The peopleare mostly pooras weliassluggish;
the deadness of their political system has made
them sluggish, and their sluggishness has made
them poor. Tasmania has the smallest revenue
per head in the Commonwealth. Though the
Customs and Excise duties are uniform, the pur-
chasing and trading power of the people of this
fertile land is so limited that Tasmania’s tariff
revenue per inhabitant is by far the least in the
Commonwealth. The savings of the people per
inhabitant, as shown by the banking returns, are
the humblest in the Commonwealth, in propor-
tion to population Tasmania has the smallest out-
put in the Commonwealth of manufactured goods.
It pays the lowest rates of wages in the Common-
wealth, and as usual low wages stand for national
poverty and national incapacity. And as ignorance,
Toryism and low wages go naturally together, it is
not surprising to find that there is, in Tasmania, a
larger proportion of people who are unable to read
or write than in any of the mainland States.
And as Toryism, poverty and illiteracy always
tend to drive wealth out of the country, it is quite
natural to find that the capital invested in Tas-
manian manufactures is decreasing, while on the
mainland of Australia there is a continuous in-
crease. Tasmania has cheap labor, very little
trades unionism, hardly any legislative interfer-
ence with industry—in fact it has, by comparison
with its sister States, almost everything that the
blatant Tory declares to be necessary to the pro-
sperity of a community. Yet it lags at the very
tail end of the Federal procession, in the same
way as Russia and Turkey, with exactly similar
blessings, lag at the tail-end of the great aggre-
gate caravan of Europe.
* * • *
Tasmania and Victoria are both cursed with
immovable Upper Houses of Rich Landlords
which exist to make progress impossible. But
Victoria had the saving Democratic virtue of a
steady Protectionist policy, while Tasmania’s fiscal
system was casual and haphazard. Victoria more
than once rose in fierce revolt against its Upper In-
cubus, while Tasmania always accepted its legislat-
ive burden of arrogant illiteracy arid incapacity as a
matter of course. And Victoria has alwa,ys been
blessed with some vestiges of a Democratic press
to keep the spirit of freedom and progress alive,
while Tasmania, until recently, possessed not a
single newspaper that wasn’t deader than the
tomb itself. Therefore, while Victoria has at
least tried to keep alive, Tasmania has been
frankly and undisguisedly and contentedly de-
ceased. It is the jest of its more active
neighbors—the Place of Sleep, the Apple
Isle, the Land of Wait-a-bit. Also it is the
land of big estates and Private Enterprise
and non-interference with the sawed rights of
property. There are hardly any strikes in Tas-
mania, and there is a great deal of religion, and
the Tasmanian worker has, as a rule, a deep
reverence for his “betters,” and is never a de-
vastating Socialist to any extent worth mention-
-1 ing, and there is a quiet Sunday-afternoon
atmosphere over all the land. No Labor party
has ever held office, or got within gunshot of
office, in the Parliament that sits at the sleepy,
cobble-stoned city of Hobart by the Derwent. Ever
since the beginning of things at Hobart the Tory
party has been in power. And the visible result
of long-continued Toryism is that Tasmania, with
greater advantages than are possessed by any
other State of the Commonwealth, hobbles along
at the extreme end of things, along with the
wounded and the baggage-carts and the camp-
followers generally.
* * * *
And now that there is an election on hand the
local Tory press performs as usual, and urges the
people to shun hasty legislation, as if there had
ever been any legislation in Tasmania that was
even half as hasty as a caterpillar. It points out
the'advantage of avoiding wild experiments, and
recommends steady progress, and implores the
public not to be “led astray.” But, seeing that
53 years of government by profoundly Tory
Ministries has only resulted in making the garden
of Australia a jest and a remnant, many people
begin to think that almost anything would be
better than the present death-in-life. Even the
return of a revolutionary majority of the kind
that waves a red banner and calls for Blood in
Sunday-afternoon orations on the Yarra-bank,
and the establishment of a Government which
would stop supplies till the Upper House con-
sented to its own complete Abolition, couldn’t
make Tasmania more completely the fag-end of
Australian progress than it is. But the island’s
Labor party is a sober, serious, business-like
institution which has no desire to wave
red flags and howl for Blood ; all it wants
is to get Tasmania moving and rescue it
from the reproach of being, despite all its natural
riches, the poorest and most unlettered of the
Federal States, and the one that the smallest pro-
portion of people want to go to and the largest
proportion of people want to get away from. The
Tasmanian Labor party simply asks for a trial,
the Tory party having had 53 years of continuous
trial, and having been convicted on every count of
the indictment. Yet the old Tasmania had its
uses, and, in a sense, it will be unfortunate if the
Labor party comes out on top. Should Labor carry
the day, and be able to put its policy into effect,
it will spoil a beautiful and most useful moral.
When the Australian Tory declares that cheap
labor is the short and certain road to prosperity,
there is Tasmania at hand as evidence to the
contrary. When he declares that Socialistic
legislation drives capital out of the country,
there is Tasmania always available to show
that it is Toryism which drives both capital and
people out of the country. When he clamors
about the evils of trades-unionism, industrial
arbitration, factory legislation, and such like,
Tasmania is right there, as evidence that the
State which has the least of these things is also the
one which has become hogged most incurably in
the rut of stagnation. The Australian reformer,
without old Tory-ridden Tasmania to point
his argument, will be like the enthusiastic teetotal
lecturer, whose Horrible Example has reformed
and given up his job. The island has done such
good service by showing its neighbors what they
shouldn’t do that they would hardly know what
to avoid if it mended its ways.
MAORILAND’S “ORDINARY WAY.”
Maoriland’s Joseph Ward announced the other
day that “ the Government had no idea of hand-
ing the cost of the Dreadnought on to posterity.
Proposals would be submitted providing for the
payment by the present generation in the ordinary
way.” Under those circumstances, it is just as
well to see what is Maoriland’s ordinary way.
For the year ended March 31, 1908, its revenue
was £9,055,946, of which £259,603 was “Terri-
torial ” ; that is to say, it consisted more or less of
the sale of assets in the shape of land, and was,
therefore, not revenue at all. Maoriland’s “ ordi-
nary way ” has been to sell every scrap of land
that it could make available, so that the present
generation should pay less taxes, and every succeed-
ing generation, on account of the shrinkage of
State land rents, should pay more. There is very
little public estate left that isn’t either a crag or a
precipice or a bubble ; in fact, there has been so
little that for many years past Maoriland has
been borrowing money to buy back some of the
land which it sold years ago. When it sold the land
it used the proceeds as revenue ; but when it
buys the land back it doesn’t pay for it out of
revenue—it borrows the money to pay the bill
with. It is a simple process by which Maoriland
eats its cake and has it too; at least, it eats its
cake, and then buys' another one for much more,
and decides that its own youngster shall pay the
pastrycook when the youngster comes of age. It
is a horribly mean performance, but it is Maori-
land’s “ordinary way”—the ordinary way that
Joe Ward seems quite proud of. There isn’t
much land left for Joseph to play this game with
nowadays; but he managed to scrape up 28,519
acres to sell for cash last year.
* * 5 *
While the revenue, and alleged revenue,
amounted to £9,316,586 —or £9,324,629, including
some refunded over-payments of the previous year
—the total expenditure was £11,532,615. Neverthe-
less Ward claimed a surplus of £850,024, achieved
in the “ordinary way.” That is to say, while
omitting a few receipts, he also omitted to in-
clude a mere trifle of £3,318,650 with the expen-
diture. The real position was as follows :
Revenue (Ordinary) .. ..£8,766,343
So-called Revenue (“ Territorial ”) .. .. 289,603
Land-Settlement rents 230,357
~ ~ other receipts 15,992
Cheviot land receipts .. 14,291
Refunds m .. .. 8,043
Total revenue M M .. ..£9,324,629
Expenditure (Ordinary) .. ..£8,213,965
„ charged to loan a/o .. 3,318,650
Total Expenditure 11,532,615
Deficit £2,207,986
It is true, of course, that J. Ward bought some
things with the £3,318,650. On the other hand,
out of this borrowed money he paid for a host of
things for which no return at all can be got, and
for a host of other things which won’t return 1
per cent, of interest. For instance :
Contingent Defence .. .. .. .. £18,574
Tourist resorts, etc 45,048
Immigration .. 9,131
Public buildings .. .. 219,260
Lighthouses, harbor defences .. .. 6,863
Rates on native lands .. .. .. .. 837
Expenses of raising loans, charges, etc. .. 52,994
Roads to open up State lands.. .. .. 38,524
Preservation of scenery 5,484
Thus roads are made to open up State lands, and
the bill is passed on to the youngster. But the
opened-up lands are sold, and the proceeds,
instead of also being passed on to the youngster
or used to pay the cost of the roads, are collared
as revenue? Even the rates which the Govern-
ment pays on native lands are charged up to the
youngster—all in the “ ordinary way.”
* * * *
And because this has become Maoriland’s
“ordinary way”—because Maoriland borrows
money to pay for things that ought to be paid for
out of revenue —the interest bill has been rushing
upwards at an alarming pace, while the revenue
has been only mounting gradually. If the loans
were put into works winch paid interest, then,
clearly, the public wouldn’t have to dip its hand
into its pocket and make up any difference out
of taxation. But since the works won’t earn
interest, the burden of taxation per head grows
heavier and heavier :
1899 .. £3 13 3 1904 .. £4 8 4
1900 .. 316 10 1905 .. 4 8 2
1901 .. 319 6 19 '6 .. 4 7 7
1902 .. 3 19 8 1907 .. 4 14 7
1903 .. 4 1 8 1908 .. 5 0 4
Only 32 per cent, of the debt is for railways, and
even the railways return only £3 6s. per cent.,
while on the average the debt costs the Dominion
£3 14s. 7d. per cent. The other 68 per cent, of
the debt of upwards of £67,000,000 is represented
by a vast accumulation of odds and ends; and the
catalogue of odds and ends has spread out
enormously during the past few years. It is very
largely because of that accumulation of odds and
ends, costing interest but producing none, that
the head of a family of five persons now has to
pay in actual taxation £25 Is. Bd. per annum,
where only 10 years ago he paid no more than
£lB 6s. 3d.; and the upward rush has increased in
a peculiarly appalling manner during the past
two years.
* * * *
Yet scarcely a year has passed without the
Maoriland Treasury playing a confidence trick
upon the public and declaring a huge, gaudy
surplus. If there had been a real surplus—if, over
and above ordinary expenditure, there had been
receipts available for investment in revenue-
producing undertakings—clearly there would have
been a gradual reduction of taxes. These invest-
ments would have been earning money and
costing nothing for interest, and taxes could
have come off to correspond. The fact
that, so far from reducing taxes, Maoriland
has had to increase them by 37 per cent, in 10
years, ought in itself to be enough to suggest that
these alleged surpluses have been a fraud and a
sham. If they had been real surpluses Maoriland
might, and no doubt would, have spent them in
paying off old, burdensome, unproductive debt.
The old Maori war debt of £2,360,000 is still, how-
ever, as good as new. It is 44 years or so since the
Maori war, but, in spite of the alleged surpluses,
the debt remains as fresh as it ever was, and
awaits payment by posterity—the same posterity
which will have to battle with Ward’s Dread-
nought I O U, if, as Ward promises, the matter
is fixed up “in the ordinary way.” For, in
matters of finance, Maoriland has only one “ordi-
nary way,” and it leads to the pawnshop. What
lies beyond the pawnshop isn’t yet clear.
Still, one can form some idea. In 10 years the
burden of taxation has increased from £3 13s. 3d.
to £5 os. 4d. per head per annum, and it would
have increased much more if many public services
hadn’t in the last few years been paid for out of
more loans. It is certain that breaking point lies
somewhere, and if Maoriland keeps on the pawn-
shop track long enough it will no doubt find out
exactly where it is.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hope for the Flyspeck.
A letter from a good Democrat in Tasmania :
A general election is due in Tasmania at the end of this
month, and the signs are in favor of a solid advance of
Democratic and Australian ideas. Since the fall of the
Propsting-Niciiolls Ministry the methods of Government
pursued by J. Evans and his following have been
characterised by a simplicity of procedure which is re-
these days of complicated statecraft. Whenever
platform promises have seemed likely to keep the Ministry
in office, the roar of J. Evans, C.M.G., has filled the land
until it has resembled a stud paddock in Basham He has
outdone all platform competitors in the wealth and width
of his expressed intentions for the welfare of the Flyspeck
and its people. Not only has he promised all that his
competitors have ever hinted at, but he has splashed out
whole jugfuls of promises of his own which he has
no visible hope of fulfilling'. When it has come
to doing things Jacky Evans has invariably accepted the
orders of the hopelessly Tory Mercury and Examiner,
whose stock phrases form the basis of the blatant bellow-
ings with which he leads his following. For the credit
of the Flyspeck, it must be admitted that this following
is the most stupid that ever sat in one Assembly. J.
Evans leads it in the way it likes to be led. And
nothing has been done except the larceny of a few of the
Opposition proposals, which, after emasculation, have
been handed to the ignorant and greedy Legislative
Council for further crippling or for rejection. Whichever
way the awful House of Dodery has maltreated these
purloined measures, Jacky has always patted the Mauso-
leum on its impervious roof, and has said that it was a
very useful body, which did “good work.” In a moment
of aberration, however, the Evans crowd adopted the
Hare system of election. This was done on the assur-
ance given by its absurd leader that it would “check
the Labor party,” and would “ bring about the two-
party system again.” The Upper Mausoleum was rather
more asleep than usual when the measure reached it, and
the few inmates who did not actually snore probably
depended on the fact that J. Evans and his following
would never willingly allow anything to get by them
which might tend to abbreviate their grasp of office. In
this case, however, the deluded Jacky, 0.M.G., has
managed to trip and fall off his political platform of
office-adhesion, for the Hare system bids fair to produce
some day a decently able Assembly. It is perfectly clear
that Jacky and his following could never have the lead in
any place where ability was needed, and the small
mariner is already beginning to realise that his slip is likely
to prove a fatal one. In the past, Ministers have gone to
the country with an alleged policy of taxing land values
and an alleged party of twenty. The humor of the situa-
tion has lain in the facttbat not three of their party, with
the doubtful exception of themselves, even pretend to
believe in their policy, and quite a dozen oppose it
bitterly. Up to recently this game has been quite suc-
cessful. The Mercury and Examiner have consistently
suppressed all attempts to expose it, and the Daily Tele-
graph—which has never been known to say “Yes” or
“ No ” save in conjunction—has yes-noed to such an
extent that nobody, not even its own proprietor, has
known what it meant. Probably it has never meant
anything at all, but it has served to cover up the Minis-
terial nakedness with a blanket of obscure verbosity.
Now a new light has arisen in Nettlefold’s new paper,
the Daily Post, which preaches land reform every day of
the week save Sundays. It would preach it on Sundays
too, if the law permitted. The Daily Post tramples ruth-
lessly on all the journalistic traditions of Southern Tas-
mania, for it arrays facts—real facts—and drives them
home. When a Southern Tasmanian reads a fact he real-
ises that his Mercury has been telling him things other
than facts for 30 years and more. Also the Daily Post
reports what people really say, even what its opponents
say, and reports truthfully, without ignoring or distorting
or suppressing the statements it aoes not agree with.
The consequences are becoming appalling, and unless the
outrageous Nettlefold is stifled or shanghaied or boiled
or put into the Upper House, or otherwise satisfactorily
obliterated, it will soon be impossible to suppress even
the humblest citizen if he has a well-founded grievance
against Torydom. The small farmers and orchardists of
Southern Tasmania have for years been gulled into
believing that the landholder was a sacred person, and
that all land taxes would hit him hard. An unimproved
land value tax would absolutely slay him outright, where-
upon Capital would utter the noise which was emitted
by’Freedom when Kosciusko fell, and would forthwith
vanish from the land. The Post has taught them that
the landholder of the Mercury is a land-loafer, and that
they, the hard-grafting orchardists and small holders,
have been paying on their improvements the tax which
should have been paid upon the land-loafer’s wasted
acres. Now the orchardists of the Huon and the Bagdad
and Derwent Valleys, are commencing to fight their old
Tory tin gods as they fight the codlin moth. They have
grasped their biggest squirt, and, led by this pernicious
Daily Post, propose to do for Parliament what they do
for their trees, to get rid of the fungi and insects which
make the fruit of both mouldy and useless. The squirt is
provided excellently-well by the Hare System, which the
vapory J. Evans, C.M.G., handed up to the Abode of
Dodery, to be passed on all unwittingly to the folk who
are prepared to use it. The medicine is already beginning
to taste bitter to the doomed following of Jacky Evans,
for by a fatal error the administration of the new system
has been placed in the hands of a Chief Electoral Officer
of unusual ability and untiring energy—a man who may
be depended upon to make its operation wholly fool-
proof. Even the last resource of appeals and recounts
will thus be lost to them.
In the North much the same thing is going on. The
Liberal Democratic League has found some able men in
VVaterworth and Lyndhurst Giblin, who may be relied
upon to fill between them the place of Niciiolls, the
founder of the League. Giblin’s speeches in Franklin
form an outstanding feature of the campaign, and he
brings to the battle a transcendent honesty of purpose
backed by an order of intellect wholly unusual in Tas-.
manian politics. Labor also will probably capture more,,
seats, unless its fatal habit of yapping spitefully at all
who will not come in to be bossed by the individual who
“ manages ” the leagues does not further deplete its vote.
That pernicious habit has probably reduced the Tas-
manian Labor party from 13 (which it could have been)
to 10, which it will be. A hopeful sign is found in the
flight of J. G. Davies, one of the Mercury brethren, from
his old electorate to the Denison division, which
includes Hobart. Elliott Lewis also stands for
this electorate. Herein lies a tale. The Mercury
fraternity fought hard to have Lewis made a
Judge. ‘The legal profession compelled the appointment
of Nicholls. So Lewis has withdrawn his promise not to
stand for Denison, and descends upon the Number One
votes of the Tory electors, already heavily mortgaged by
Crowther, at the expense of Mercury Davies. The latter
individual will probably do Tasmania the inestimable
service of being emptied out of a Parliament where he
has posed more pompously and blundered more egregi-
ously than any other of the weird political freaks who
have caused half-asphyxiated pressmen to smile ai they
gazed wearily down upon that strange menagerie. At a


reasonable estimate, the approaching Flyspeck election
should put at least 18 genuine Land Value Tf«eis into a
House of Assembly which numbers 30. If the Labor
men are sensible they can get that great reform through
the Assembly within three years by the help of the
Liberals. Whatever may happen, it seems quite clear
that the Liberal party will hold the balance of power,
and as it will certainly hold most of the
brains, education, business capacity, and pluck of
the House, it will control the situation so far as the
Assembly noes. There is a small of a similar leaven-
i„.r in tlie Bone Yard upstairs, but the Nine Old Gentle-
men who spend the futile remnant of their days m filling
waste-paper baskets with the work of those who strive for
progress, still survive. Reform of the Land Laws and
Reform of the Upper or Dead House will create a new
Tasmania, but until a merciful Pkovidknce steps in, or
until the power of misrepresentation wielded by the lor}
press is effectively broken, these cannot come about, the
best prospect of hope is to be found in Nkttlkfold and
his Daily Post, and from these will he born that Jew
Tasmania wherein men and women will he regarded as of
Tnore value than sheep, and the blatant roar of persons
like Jacky Evans, 0.M.G., will no longer cause the young
and able to fly the country.
A Programme That Will Never Have a
Nominee.
To appreciate the humbug and futility of the
Orange political programme, which was officially
given to the world (16/4’09), it is only necessary to
apply it to the views of those of the Yellow Pup
persuasion now in the Australian Parliament-
men whom the Yellow Pup party will undoubtedly
continue to support at each- succeeding election
till death, gaol, or the Last Trump supervenes.
The first plank of the “ Protestant Political Plat-
form ” provides for: —
Defence— (1) Naval, (a) effective subsidy to the British
navy, (b) adequate harbor and coast defence..
Military.—(a) Citizen soldiery, (b) universal training.
Joe Cook, G. Reid, Jawbone Nkild, and
Willy Kelly hive roundiy condemned both
the idea of Australian harbor and coast defence,
and that of universal training. They have
jeered in and out of season at the absurdity
of mere Australians attempting to guard any
marine thing. They have talked acidly of
“ mosquito fleets,” and of worthless destroyers of
the River class-vessels which must sink, so they
allege, if they venture outside the Heads in a blow
—and of Labor’s “insolent folly” in prattling
about such things. And then they have laughed
with a pity akin to tears, and dismissed the sub-
ject as too hopeless for further discussion. From
a thousand tubs they have expressed their unshak-
able conviction that the only sea defence policy
for sane and patriotic Australians consists in
hiring protection from abroad. The thought of
universal training—the land-defence policy of the
Deakin and Labor parties—has tilled them,
hitherto, not with amusement, but with wrath.
When universal service is mentioned they wail
about “conscription,” and hasten to state the
obvious untruth that nothing of the sort has ever
been needed to bring Britons to the scratch in
time of stress ; and they argued that Australia
should rely indefinitely for latid defence on its
volunteer cadets and boy scouts. Then comes
Plank 111. of the platform :
(3) Fiscalism.—Maintenance of a fixed policy.
It is a vague sort of aspiration, but if it means
anything it means presumably tariff peace; i.e., a
maintenance of the measure of Protection that
the Commonwealth enjoys at present. But
Johnson, of Lang, B. Smith, and a dozen more
cranks whom the' Yellow Pup section will un-
questionably support at next elections, are pledged
to fight untiringly in the Federal House for the
establishment of “ a state of pure Freetrade.” It is
doubtful if any member of the Cook party (barring
G. Reid, who is irrevocably outcast, and Bill
Wilks, whose erstwhile low-tariff constituents in
Dailey electorate are now ardent Protectionists)
would dare to own.that he wasn’t panting to upset
Australia’s present “fixed policy ” of Protection
and battle for undiluted OOBDEN-ism. And finally
the first of the General Aims of the new party is :
To oppose anj r form of Socialism in conflict with
Christianity.
Only that and nothing more. The party isn’t
going to oppose, which must mean that it intends
to support, the nationalisation of monopolies, a
graduated land-tax and all the other Socialistic
proposals unconnected with religion which the
R,EID-ite candidates said, three years ago, with
the full concurrence of the Yellow Pup brigade,
were absolute Gehenna. As long as local democrats
don’t advocate atheism, marriage-tie,bursting and
the like—which they never did in any case, anyhow
—the new party will approve their candidatures.
That is to say the Orange vote must go to people
of the Fisher way of thinking (whom the lodges
have classed up to now, no matter what their
creeds were, as Vatican minions and emissaries of
Rome), as opposed to the wliole-hog Individualists
of the Cook party —people who hold that Socialism
in any form is a curse, regardless of its bearing on
theology. Which is absurd. The explanation of
the appearance of the Protestant political plat-
form is to be found in the fact that the Yellow
Pup faction has been going more and more out of
favor with the masses of late ; and it knows it.
It is widely recognised among Democrats as a
shrieking brotherhood whose sole mission is to
barrack for the causes of importerdom, monopoly,
frothy jingoism and low wages. The lodges want
new men. Well-to-do folks, though they accept
Orangeism’s support at election times, refuse to
have anything to do with it once the polling is
finished. Unless a big leaven of Laborites can be
lured into the fold, the cause of Derry is likely to
wilt and die. The new programme, with its
flavoring of Democracy and Australianism, may
be likened to the artificial fly that is dangled
before the Monaro trout. There is no more sus-
tenance or sincerity in it than there is in a gold
brick. The worker that swallows it deserves all
that is coming to him.

An Object Lesson in “ Conscription.”
A feature worth noting about the Australian
Dreadnought business is that it began quite as a
voluntary affair. Three old gentlemen, looking
across their wine at a club in Sydney, said that
they would give £IO,OOO a-piece; and the Sydney
Telegraph and other papers were quite sure that
tens of thousands more would empty their pockets
in the good cause. The voluntary racket lasted for
about a week, and then a change blew up from
the sea; and the Telegraph and the rest
began squealing at the top of their voices
for Government action. Day by day Prime
Minister Fisher was told that Australia was
waiting for time to speak. Meantime Joseph.
Prince of Bluff, in Maoriland, bad spoken—
“ One Dreadnought for certain and two if neces-
sary”—and the Australian papers asked Fisher
to consider what a great man Joseph was. Maori-
land, the S. M. Herald said, echoing the Argus,
“has a genius for doing the right thing at the
right moment.” Still the voluntary donations
continued to be appealed for, and two Gaud
Mayors issued frenzied shouts calling upon the
people to pay, pay, pay. The papers, however,
knew very well that the people wouldn’t pay, pay,
pay worth a cent; so, when Fisher said lie
wouldn't try the cash conscription device
they turned to Murray and Wade. And
when Murray and Wade caved in, the daily
papers, almost as one linotype, headed the sur-
render “At Last!” and the melted butter was
poured over the heads of the State Premiers.
Now, the thing to note is that these papers which
so enthusiastically threw over the voluntary idea,
and called upon the Governments to com-
pulsory contributions, are whole-hog anti-“com-
pulsionists.” When the patty which wants
compulsory training, in order to secure the defence
of Australia, proposed a mild scheme of that sort,
these papers yelled excitedly that it was„“ hateful
conscription,” that it was “un-British,” that it
wasn’t wanted, that. voluntary service filled the
bill, and that in the hour of danger the people could
be relied upon to do their duty. Now, however,
they use their biggest, blackest type to shriek to
the public that the hour of danger has arrived ; but
after trying their beautiful voluntary ideas for
five days or so, they throw them overboard as
utterly valueless, and shriek for compulsion—
for the enforcement of a contribution from every
taxpayer whether he wants to contribute or not.
If their experience in this “hour of danger ’’ has
taught a lesson to the papers and the rest of the
anti-compulsory service crowd, perhaps £2,000,000
isn’t too much to pay as a fee. But there are great
doubts whether they have learned the lesson. A
small thing like consistency doesn’t worry them ;
wherefore, while they have clamored for compul-
sory service in the cause of Britain, it is quite
likely that they will stili think that the busted
voluntary idea is good enough in the cause of
Australia.
‘Great Activity” in the Land Market.
Whenever one Victorian sells a block of land to
another man the Melbourne Argus joyfully
chronicles the fact as a “ movement in the land
market,” and when half-a-dozen blocks change
hands the glad tidings are proclaimed with big
headings. Half of these sales are speculations,
and not only do no good to the country, but do
a considerable amount of harm. About the only
people who get anything out of the transactions
are the solicitors who fix up the transfers. At
latest, the Argus has been exploring in the Titles
Office, where it has made the tremendous dis-
covery that “ there have been a greater number
of transfers in Victoria during the last three
months than has ever before been recorded for the
same period.” And the Argus proclaims the
joyful news on its cable page, in half a column,
with several scare headings. Also, as is so often
the case in Argus articles on land matters, the
true inwardness of the whole matter accidentally
slips out at the tail of the article :
Although the transfers recorded for the three months
are so large (1199) it does not follow that an equivalent
number of individual farms has been added to those in
the State. In many instances one neighbor buys out
another, and increases the size of his holding. The mini-
mum area which can be brought under the land-tax is
640 acres. For the half-year ending August, 1908, 72 new
estates were added to the land-tax register, and 55
estates already on the register had more land added to
them. For the half-year ended February, 1909, 96 new
estates were placed on the register, and 55 previously on
were increased in area.
This cheerful bit of information comes curiously
from the paper which is always declaring that the
big estates are gradually disappearing “ in the
natural order of things. ” If there is any one fact
truer than another about the land question, it is
that a landowner is always prepared to enlarge
his holding. It is the rarest thing in the world to
find a landowner voluntarily getting rid of any of
his land. There is something fascinating about
land ; something which is always urging the owner
of land to try and get hold of his neighbor’s
block. And, although it is totally against the
best interests of the community that he should
succeed in doing so, no steps are taken to prevent
him. So that, day by day, we find farmers buy-
ing adjoining farms; and every time that this
happens a family is lost to the district, and often
to the State. Many years ago Denmark noticed
this tendency and its disastrous results. But it
promptly provided a remedy, and passed a
drastic law to prevent land accumulation. These
States, and especially Victoria, are badly in need
of such a law. As the result of it, there would
probably be a great deal less “activity in the
land market,” but there would be a big and
wholesome increase in the prosperity of the
country in general.
A New, Strange Sort of Madness.
Mr. R. M. Johnston, the Tasmanian Statist,
must have been bitten recently by something
very deadly. In delving for reasons why the
Commonwealth should start and the States should
continue borrowing, Johnston has discovered a
new source of wealth. Or rather, he has discovered
some stupendous quantities of wealth of which
nobody had any notion before. He has compared
the cost of railway fares and freights in 1870 with
those ruling to-day, and the difference he calls
“ hidden values.” But let the remarkable John-
ston speak for himself :
For every £1 now obtained as gross receipts there is a
hidden value saved to either producers or consumers of
at least £2, apart from the actual profits of the railways
as an undertaking. Calculating the amount of this
hidden value from the reeeipts of the railways in the
year 1906-7, we arrive at the conclusion that its value
represents for the year a sum of £28,910,902, equivalent
to a present capital value of £826,000,000. The whole of
the States’ indebtedness of £240,000,000 seems a small
affair alongside of this bona-fide, though hidden, State
benefit.
This weird, midsummer madness is only equalled
by the story told to The Bulletin of how an im-
pecunious friend made £l :
When living in a country town I wanted a lawn-mower,
and asked the price of one at the local store. They
wanted £3. I wrote to the universal provider in the city,
and got the same lawn-mower for £2. It was the easiest
£ll have ever earned.
Obviously, by going on buying lawn-mowers, and
getting a hidden value of £1 on each, the man
would become a millionaire in time. And, being
a millionaire, he would naturally have no diffi-
culty in parting up to pay for his own current
wants. It is just at this point, in fact, that,
instead of being an argument in favor of borrow-
ing, Johnston’s wonderful idea is an argument in
favor of insisting on cash. For clearly if the rail-
ways make the people at large a present of £2
every time they pay £l, the people ought to be in
a position to find cash for no end of things, instead
of paying in lOU’s. Possibly the next generation
may get for 10s. what the present generation has
to pay £1 for ; but there can be no certainty about
that. In fact, things may turn the other way
around, and the next generation may have to pay
30s. instead of £l. Therefore it would be a
monstrous thing for this generation, which (ac-
cording to Johnston) has had tens of millions put
into its pockets, to pass on the bill to the next
generation, which may quite likely be much
worse off than this generation. The Argus, which
does so hanker for a return to the old pawnshop
ways of finance, fails to see, however, that the
more money you have in your pockets, the less of
your debts you should pass on to your children.
Its idea is that, the cheaper you get a thing, the
more of it you should owe for. On that principle,
of course, people are very foolish to buy the
Argus now that it has been reduced from 3d. to
Id. It was all very well to pay for it when it was
3d., but now it has come down to Id. the proper
thing—as the Argus sees quite clearly—is to
borrow it. Or, at any rate, having to pay only
Id. instead of the old 3d. for the Argus, it is
insane to pay for the Australasian if you want
that too. Being 2d. bettor off, of course you show
your gratitude to the Argus by cadging the
Argus’s weekly heavyweight.
The Thing that was Contemplated.
The Melbourne Employers’ Federation has
lodged its solemn protest against the proposed
Federal graduated land-tak on the alleged ground
that —
It was never contemplated that the Commonwealth
should impose direct taxation except in circumstances of
extremity.
This sort of thing is heard so often that one is
tempted to ask who are these contemplators who
are always quoting themselves as persons whose
interpretation of the Constitution must be
accepted ? We have been told that it was never
contemplated , when the Constitution was drafted,
that the Federal capital should be over 100 miles
from Sydney : also that it was never CONTEMPLATED
that the Australian Parliament should interfere
with industrial legislation, land-tax, old-age
pensions, etc., etc. In fact, it seems that nothing
which the Stout Person dislikes was ever CON-
TEMPLATED. Who did all this contemplation ?
The question is a pertinent one, for great national
issues hang upon it. The Fat Person has set up
a monstrously cheeky theory to the effect that—
(l) The Constitution isn’t simply the document which
the people accepted, but that document with any old
additions and subtractions that he (the Fat Person) likes
to make, because he is aware of what was contemplated
at the time.
(2) Though he was never at a single meeting of the
Federal Convention which drafted the Constitution, and
never read the debates, and took hardly any interest in
the matter, he knows exactly what was contemplated.
(3) He can’t explain why all these alleged contempla-
tions weren’t inserted in the Bill, but they were contem-
plated all the same.
(4) He can’t say who CONTEMPLATED them, but they
were contemplated.
(5) Nobody who wasn’t living at the time when the
Constitution was drafted has a right to contemplate any-
thing.
(6) The last Fat survivor of the period when the Con-
stitution was drafted should be Dictator of Australia.
For he will be the last and final repository of all tiiis
tremendous contemplation which, it seems, overrules the
Constitution, or at least interprets it and throws new
light upon it, and shows that it is something quite
different from what it appears to he on the surface.
(7) And when that last, survivor dies, Australia must
be ruled in the light of the wisdom which he has left
behind him, because he was the last contemplator ; the
last man who knew what was contemplated ; and all the
old original contemplation died with him.
(8) And the opinions, necessities, and policies of the
living nation will count for nothing. For the contem-
plative person who is dead runs the whole show.
Consequently it seems to be a fair thing that
all this contemplation should be cleared up and
put on a sound basis once and for all.

It is a blessed circumstance for Australia that
Peter Bowling’s wild proposal to declare a
general strike as a protest against the proposed
trial of Tom Mann at Albury was firmly turned
down. Certainly the action of State Premier
Wade in fixing Albury as the site of Mann’s trial
was as clumsy as most of his other doings. It is
probably quite true that it would be impossible to
get a unionist convicted just now at Broken Hill,
even on the most overwhelming evidence ; and if
so, that might be a good reason for shifting the
venue. But, on the other hand, there are places
where a unionist could easily be convicted on
hardly any evidence at all—agricultural places
where the cocky believes in long hours and short
wages, and where it is a crime to even object to
protracted hours and very brief remuneration.
When the Dibbs Government had Sleath and
Ferguson tried at Deniliquin, there was a very
widespread impression that it was looking for
one of these places, and there is a similar
impression now. A change of venue to Sydney
would have roused far less ill-feeling, and the cry
of “ man’s inhumanity to Mann ’’need not have
arisen. But a general strike would be an ele-
phantine remedy. It would be illegal—though
probably that would not trouble Peter Bowling.
It would—in a community which enjoys adult
suffrage, and where the will of the people
must prevail if the people only take the
trouble to decide what their will really is—be
a declaration that Parliamentary Government
is a failure, and that the choice lies between
anarchy and despotism. If the strike was
really “geneial,” then the destruction of
industry, the long months of scanty employment
while the dislocated affairs of the country were
getting into order again, and the general break-up
would cost more millions than Peter Bowling
ever dreamed of. And if the strike failed, then
the injury done to the principle of Unionism
would be appalling. Tom Mann, the voluble,
impracticable ex-beer-seller, isn’t worth the price
of such a convulsion.
G. R. Sims, who makes a specialty of exposing
Freetrade fallacies, lately published an analysis
of Britain’s “untaxed” plum-pudding. Lloyd
George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had
stated that the Government would perish ratherthan
subject the working-man’s Christmas puddin’ to
Tariff duties. G. R. Sims pointed out that the
only untaxed ingredients of the puddin’ aforesaid
are those which could and ought to be produced
in Britain under a Protectionist policy, whereas all
the ingredients which must be imported to that
Cold Country are taxed for revenue purposes.
The duties, though small', are nevertheless a satire
on Cobden’s “glorious principle of Freetrade.”
For instance, sugar and currants are both taxed,
raisins pay 7s. per cwt., and candied peel pays Is.
4d. per cwt. Flour, suet and eggs, the things
which Britain produces, but doesn’t produce
enough of, come in free of duty. In short,
Britain’s fiscal policy, as regards the pluni-puddin’,
is Freetrade where the foreigner can be advan-
taged and Protection where there is nothing to
protect and the foreigner cannot be disadvan-
taged.

D 3ATH statistics make gruesome reading at the
best of times : but when the statistician takes his
axe and cleaves up his figures so as to show the
proportion of infant departures, they are more
gruesome than ever. The other day the man
whose job it is to count up and dissect the births
and deaths in Sydney and suburbs sent out the
results of his toil; and some of those results are
gloomy enough to decorate a hearse with. It
isn’t that the figures are uniformly bad ; if they
were, their badness wouldn’t be so obvious. It is
because the infant-death figures show such tre-
mendous variations that one sees what an appalling
amount of the infant death is avoidable —in other
words, what an appalling number of little Aus-
tralians get murdered every year. In one group
of airy suburbs, those of the North Shore line,
running round to Manly on the one side and to
Ryde on the other, only 52 little Australians out
of every 1000 who were born died last year before
they had their first birthday ; and in the moder-
ateiy-airy outer western suburbs, from Petersham
on to Concord, only 59 per 1000. But in low-
lying, crowded St. Peters, a suburb where often
the little Australian’s only chance of taking the
air is in a little smoky back-yard or in the gutter
in front, no less than 132 per 1000 faded away to
the cemetery ; and at Botany and North Botany
the butchery works out at about 128. Of every
100 jobs that the undertaker has in St. Peters no
less than 39 are to bury some poor little Australian
of under a year, who never had a chance;
in the outer western suburbs the proportion is
only 19 in 100. Australia —and Sydney in par-
ticular—got quite excited over the languishing
birth-rate a few years ago ; it seems about time it
began to get a little more excited over the child-
murder rate, which is only languishing in spots.
+
Nowadays, it seems, when a draper advertises
there is a vacant broom in his establishment wait-
ing for a small, half-educated boy to wield it, and
errands languishing for the want of the same youth
to run them, the road isn’t blocked as it used to
be with eager, foolish women, towing young,
touzled-headed brigands to their doom on the
altar of Commerce. An eminent member of the
craft lately appeared before the Post Office Com-
mission, and, without any apparent embarrass-
ment, testified as follows :
The chief difficulty his firm experienced now was in
getting good men to fill the responsible positions in the
business. The labor trouble with them commenced at
the bottom of the ladder. Time was when they advertised
for a messenger the street in front of their establishment
would have been blocked with boys and their mothers
trying to get in. Now they could advertise for two or
three days without getting a suitable applicant. That
was evidence of the general prosperity, and also that boys
were not crowding into the city as was the case a few
years ago.
In connection with this, it is interesting to recall
that when the London School Board lately
adopted compulsory education for children up to
15, and the half-time system up to 18, the mer-
chants of London uprose in one mass and cried
out—even as this local magnate has cried out—
that the lack of office-boys and similar small fry
would be a severe blow for Commerce. The
L. 5.8., in making the regulation, was looking
forward to the time when the lads would be
wanted by the employers for their brains, instead
of as mere delivery machines and dusting appli-
ances; so it ignored the clamor of the greedy,
short-sighted city men, and went ahead with
its preparations for giving the youngsters
a fair mental equipment for .their coming
struggle with the world. The provision of half-
time up to 18 years of age is an especially
valuable one. No child of 15, or thereabouts, is
so full of learning that it can afford to make a
bonfire of its books ; yet that is practically what
is done by the average boy or girl who drifts out
to earn a few dear shillings a week as a sort of
errand appliance or stamp-lick in an office. This
lack of education doesn’t make for even commer-
cial supremacy —much less for national greatness.
Ignorance is responsible for half life’s tragedy and
most of its business failures.
Home Minister Mahon seems to have been
bitten by a notion that also afflicts a lot
of other Labor leaders—that there is only
a certain amount of work available in the
country, and that it must be parcelled out
among as many as possible. A trifle of artisan
work needs doing at the S. Australian torpedo
station ; and, as the place is hard to get at, and
the work can be done by the regular staff on the
station, the Defence Department suggested that
it be done that way. But Mahon has ruled that
publws servants must not come into competition
with ordinary tradesmen, and that the work must
be done by outsiders. Which is merely a varia-
A Dreadnought Dialogue.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We have scarcely rifles enough to arm 10 per cent, of
the men in our rifle clubs. — Recent official statement.
The States:—
“Britain, our dear Mother Britain, lend us thine
ear for a while.
We who are sprung from thy bod}’, shall we not
care for thine Isle?
Lapped by the waves of Pacific, lulled by the sigh
of her seas,
Long have we lain in our dreaming, lazily laughing
at ease.
“Now in this moment of peril, shall we not come
to thine aid ?
We who are sons of the Mother, strenuous,
unafraid ?
Choose how thy children shall help thee; shall
not their weapons be thine?
Have what thou wilt for the choosing, warriors or
ships of the line.
“True, we have manifold dangers; nigh is the
hour of our fate.
Europe is scowling and greedy; Asia is hard at
the Gate.
We are but newly a nation, scarce are we firm on
our feet,
But when the Mother’s endangered shall we not
do what is meet?”
The Mother:—
“Thanks to you, thanks to you, children! Send
me your galleons of war;
Sweet is the off’ring ye tender, dearest of babes
that I bore ;
But I would ask you, my children, knowing your
coast is my own,
What of the ramparts ye’ve builded, mighty in
cannon and stone ?
“ How with your fleet is it faring? Prowls it by
night and afar,
Watching like vigilant dragon, lighting the deep
as a star ?
What of your legions of warriors, lines with a tip-
ping of steel ?
What of your black-muzzled cannon, flashing in
peal upon peal ? ”
The States :
“Ramparts and fleet, mighty mother, these we
shall get by-and-bye ;
Navies and numberless legions— we’ve got them all
in our eye ;
True, in that line at the present little or nought
have we done ;
But you’ll be heartened at hearing, “Ev’ryten
men have a gun !!! ”

ment.)

Abo. writers seem to differ in opinion,
among other subjects, as to the weather wiseness
of their black brothers. But there can only be
one opinion as to the ability of D.C.L. Whisky to
inspire the best of wisdom on all subjects. And
the wisdom so delightfully imparted by the
scholarly brand is, like D.C.L. itself, just the
thing for everyday use.*
tion of the folly that makes some men advocate a
six-hour day, so that four men can be employed
where three toil now. If the men at the remote
torpedo station can do the work without neglecting
their proper employment, they should do it, and
the outside tradesmen be put to something else.
There is no scarcity of work in Australia. There is
at present in sight at least 20 years’hard graft for
thousands of tradesmen of all sorts, in building
the two transcontinental lines, developing the
Northern Territory, constructing arsenals, dock-
yards, shipyards, ammunition factories, blast
furnaces, rolling mills, etc., etc. The only diffi-
culty is the money, though, as regards this par-
ticular little job, Mahon seems to have made no
difficulty about that. And, anyhow, if Mahon
spends sixpence in doing a twopenny job, there
is a clear waste of fourpence, and Australia hasn’t
got so many fourpences that it can afford to waste
any of them. It has so much to do, in fact, that
it wants all the fourpences it can possibly save.

A Literary Imperialist.
“ 0.K.” writes :
A humorous feature of the Dreadnought outbreak, as
of any similar Jingo disturbance, is the publication of
particulars re the magnitude of the British empire. Its
diffuseness, wealth, mileage and human numerical
strength are set forth in newspaper paragraphs, with the
tacit conclusion that everything is “ purely British ”
which belongs to the empire, and that foreign designs
against its greatness are necessarily iniquitous. But a
statement of the number of British subjects throughout
the world is from, say, the German or Russian point of
view, merely a satire on Britain’s imperial pretensions.
If the 400 and odd millions of subjects were all whites
and British in their sympathies, the rivalry of Germany
would appear equally arrogant and hopeless. It is, how-
ever, only by rule of White that the mightiness of the
empire is maintained in India and other places of mostly
colored population. And the total number of white
British subjects is less than the number of Germans
or Russians in the world. Therefore, if White is
Might in matters of sovereignty, and Might is Right,
Germany has more right to the empire we hear so much
talk about than Britain has. On the other hand, there
are more white men born to speak English than can claim
German or Russian for their native tongue. To my way
of thinking, the justification of British Imperialism at
the present time lies in the fact that there are 80 millions
of Americans, and that English and American literatures
are interchangeable. Thanks to the country which “ cut
the painter ” more than a century ago, the English lan-
guage (with American embellishments) is the world's
Imperial language ; nor is there any chance of it losing
its pre-eminence, even though Germany were to become
the governing power in India, Africa and Australia.
British rule may be blown to smithereens in sundry
places, but the English language is an indestructible and
ever increasing fact. It can be shifted only from those
British possessions where an enormous majority
of the population are colored persons, and the
Government issues its mandates in forms of
foreign translation. When one considers that the
English tongue is the one thing common to all
white British subjects, Jew or Gentile, and that in all
other respects they are a mixed crowd, the popular cant
of Jingoism seems intolerably foolish. I—the present
writer—am an Imperialist whose soul is unmoved by plat-
form references to British Race, British Pluck, British
Empire, and Rule Britannia. But if any excited Dread-
nought citizen in a frock coat and a lucid interval were
to call for three cheers for the English Language, without
reference to the blessed Flag that floats over so many
subjects who don’t speak it, I would proudly join in the
uproar. At the time of the Boer war I was pro-British
because Krugkr. was an enemy to my mother tongue, and
would, if he could, have prohibited its utterance in
S’Africa. The English language and the Boer Taal were
fighting for supremacy, it seemed, and all my sympathies
were with the former. Now that the blessed Flag of
the empire merely waves over a country where
the Taal is taught in State schools, and the
Speakers of Legislative Assemblies offer up a
prayer in Taal, and the English language is being
permitted by the British Government to go to the D—l,
my pro-Britishness is tired, not to say exhausted. The
Boers can use the Flag as a pocket handkerchief, and
turn the British National Anthem into a comic song for
all I care. If the owners of the soil in the future are
not going to talk English and get their sentiments from
English literature, they can wave the German flag as far
as I’m concerned. The capture of India by the Germans
would not greatly distress me, seeing that 99 per cent, of
the population don’t speak English. If those hundreds of
millions of British subjects were suddenly converted into
German subjects, the Imperial power of the language of
Australia, and the prospects of the literature of this
country, would be but slightly affected. And if Great
Britain were swallowed up by the ocean next week, there
would still be America to maintain the only sort of Im-
perialism which, in my opinion, is worth whooping for.
The strange thing is that the wild, unreasoning, blind,
fanatical, unpatriotic Australian Jingoes attach so much
more importance to Mother Country than to Mother
Tongue.
o-
Amongst a shoal of furiously Jingo letters that
appeared in the Melbourne Argus during Dread-
nought week was a rather remarkable epistle
from John L. Currie, one of the best-known of
the Vic. Western District squatters. Most of the
Jingo letters were hopelessly impracticable, and
gave no help in the way of finance ; while those
which did touch that aspect of the question,
mostly tried to shove the burden on to the other
fellow. Here is Currie’s proposal:—
Let the Government replace the duty on tea for a time,
put an extra tax on motor-cars, petrol, champagne, to-
bacco and cigars, double the land-tax on properties over
5000 acres, and treble the income-tax on all incomes over
ElOO. Let these imposts remain on for three years, and
be ear-marked for this purpose.
There is something refreshing about John L.
Currie. He owns a big estate, and his three
brothers and sister do likewise. All five own
motor-cars, and so use petrol; and they all smoke
except the sister. The increase in the land-tax
would hit the whole family ; and so would the big
increase proposed op the income-tax. So that
John L. would contribute through every one of
his proposed taxes, and his four affluent relatives
would do likewise. John L. has a healthy sus-
picion of *• private liberality,’’ which would result,
he says, in a
splendid response for a few weeks by a small section of
natnotie and generous donors ; and hundreds will contri-
bute nothing, though well able to do so. Especially
this applies to absentee owners of large properties resi-
dent in England or Europe, and to trustees of large
estates both in town and country. ... It is so easy to lie
low and say nothing and give nothing, and to say you are
only a trustee, etc.
It is not very often that The Bulletin finds itself
approving the action of a rich landlord ; but it
hereby shakes hands with John L. Currie, of
Lara, Camperdown, and wishes him luck. By the
way, his taxation proposals have so far met with
a stony silence in the Argus. What his brother-
squatters think of his letter is probably too
dreadful for print.

Philip Wirth is responsible for a refreshing
equine stunt, in which a showy black and white
pony is put through a series of tricks on a lorry
driven round the ring at a fair rate. When the
lorry gets properly going he leans in like a
cyclist riding a saucer-track, and displays a keen
sense of the niceties of equilibrium. Guillaume,
Baby and co. supply some clowning with consider-
ably more vigor than their predecessors of a week
back, and their buffoonery permeates the show
with an atmosphere of youthful irresponsibility
that is the one thing desired in this most ancient
form of amusement. Mounier and Franz hurl
quantities of iron about, and apply their teeth in
the scheme of things as much as they do their
hands. They tread the well-worn path of the
strong man, but Mounier’s 2601 b. two-handed
lift has a savor of genuine effort that is
somewhat refreshing. Muller is eminently suc-
cessful in grouping a number of so-called
wild animals on an abundance of stools
when he is not engaged in arranging his
superfluity of furniture. Apparently Muller re-
gards the arranging of the furniture as being
equally important with the training of the
animals, judging by the pains he takes with it.

luck. A trio of musicians extract a variety of
noises from most unexpected places, and occasion-
ally a terrible conflict between various noises and
the band drives the artists to the performance of
strange antics. John Welby Cooke retains his
seat on the extreme corner of the galloping charger
with all his accustomed ease and grace; which
is the more remarkable in that the steed
hasn’t a knot) or a bone visible on which John W.
Cooke can hook himself. The elephants are
in great force, and present their version of the
Merry Widow Waltz—which is a fearful and
solemn warning to ladies of mature years to, first,
never grow fat, and, second, never do the
Merry Widow Waltz if an unkind Providence
should allow them to fall into flesh. The writer
is assured that the warning will not be so em-
phatic next week, as the movements nightly grow
more fairylike, and Jumbo’sextrernities are under-
going a course of pedicure. Generally speaking,
the circusing at George-street West is up to the
high standard of the Wirths, as that best of
guarantees, a full tent and people turned away,
is to be seen nightly.

“Jack and Jill” has settled down to a
steady run of business at Her Majesty’s (Sydney).
According to the original disarrangement of
things Jack was the inale person who went up a
hill looking for water when, if there had been
free, secular and compulsory education where he
hung out, he would have known that he had only
to stay at the bottom of the hill and the water
would come down to him. And Jill was the
foolish female person who accompanied Jack on
the eminently unwise expedition. But the un-
scientific character of these two individuals is so
disguised by scenery and costumes and irrelevant
episodes and a garish magnificence of lighting that
their ignorance doesn’t strike the beholder. The
pantomime of “ Jack and Jill ” is altogether
beautiful, and if Melbourne—which is a place of
no importance, situated in what snutflesome old
John Robertson described as a Cabbage Garden—
could keep it going for 101 nights Sydney reckons
it is able to do better than that without turning a
hair.

“An Englishman’s Home” bursts at Syd-
ney Theatre Royal punctually at 10.15 each even-
ing-barring Sundays. (Even a foreign invader
wouldn’t have the audacity to desecrate the
British Sabbath by home-smashing on the Day of
Rest, prayer, and post-prandial dyspepsia.)
“ That man,” as the S. M. Herald observes, “is
little to be envied whose patriotism would nod
gain force by witnessing this plav.” A true
word. When the writer saw “An Englishman’s
Home,” and reflected that he came of the same
grand, warlike old stock as Finch and his fellow
warriors, he with difficulty restrained himself
from directing the whole of his domestic staff (one
“general”) to donate a week’s wages to Allen
Taylor’s fund on pain of being straightway sacked.

-“ The Hypocrites ” are still at it at Sydney
Criterion. They supply the love-interest—which
is so noticeably lacking from the Theatre Royal
show—to an extent that should satisfy the most
sentimental. It is not too much to say that there
is enough crude love lying round in a boiling
state in “The Hypocrites” to people a normal-
sized Home of Refuge and two Creches. More-
over, the play offers the stirring spectacle of a
parson maddened to the pitch of saying “ Damn.”
In a word, “The Hypocrites” is a play to see,
and, as it isn’t going to be here many more weeks,
intending patrons are counselled to hurry up.

“ Queen of the Night,” the dramatic
bloodstain which has been dyeing Sydney Palace
crimson for the past 10 days, is to be wiped away
after Friday evening next. Its place will be
taken by “In the Ranks,” a reliable old military
thriller wherein the British soldier fairly smears
himself with glory, and reduces his craven and
incompetent foe to a rag or tatter of his former
self. It is no breach of confidence to mention
that the strains of “Gor’ Save” will be heard
several times nightly at the Palace for the next
few weeks; furthermore, it may be hinted that
the Flag—the same that W. E. Johnson and his
young friend Willie Kelly have notified their
resolve to keep flying, or, in default, bust pub-
licly—will be there in good waving-order.

At Sydney Glaciarium, West’s Pictures
have a prophetic atmosphere about them. The
building of a Dreadnought is shown, and the pro-
cess of manufacturing the huge 12in. guns is
carried on before the eves of the people who are
being asked to pay for one. When the Dread-
nought has faded out, something like a century of
views of old Japan whirl across the screen, and the
Australian gets a glimpse of the land where
George Reid may yet be relegated to scullery
work while he is a prisoner of war. After this
the Sydney Boy Scouts get loose, and do the Red
Indian act on their stomachs, while holding one
ear above the grass to catch sounds of the enemy
in the far distance. West is evidently a patriot.

At Sydney Lyceum, Spencer’s chrono-
megaphone is still raging, and the voice of Harry
Lauder rolls over stall and pit. Also, it hits the
circle where it lives, and moves the gods to mirth.
Wili Evans, whoever he may be, gives a satirical
“Invasion of 1910,” which is followed by a film
on invasion and its probabilities. Unfortunately,
it is not the invasion of Australia that is dealt
with ; the Australian is merely worked up to a
frenzy of fear lest the Cold Country may be
attacked by civilised white men, and is lured into
forgetfulness of the fact that where he sits may
be invaded by yellow heathendom. Spencer
also shows scenes of Japan, likewise the recent
Agricultural Show, the Messina earthquake
(which is a horrible and dreary exhibition that
ought to be suppressed), and the usual variety of
satirical and humorous pictures.

The “Cornish Pixie,” who is at present
holding receptions at Pitt-street, Sydney, is a
pathetic but not a repulsive figure. In the
majority of dwarfs there is evidence of arrested
growth, and the exact stage at which the process
of increase ceased is plainly visible. This little
creature, who is 25 inches high and weighs only
9Jjlb., is merely a miniature man. There is no
sign of arrested development. He seems fully
matured, and his head is intellectual and well
moulded. His hands, though large for his size
and apparently double-jointed, have the curious
tapering fingers which in the sensational novel are
the hall mark of aristocratic birth and high descent
from aged nobility. He gives one the impression
of being the last of some decadent, aristocratic
race that had grown smaller and smaller till it
became a community of pretty little Dresden-
china people, like those whom Wells’s explorer
found on the Time Machine far down the ages yet
to come. Of course, in reality, he represents one
of the blunders of Providence ; he is an example
of what happens when the Potter’s hand shakes
badly. He is the man whom Creation made and
then forgot, and who grew old and older without
increasing in stature. The only things about
him that seem uncanny are the weak, some-
what watery eyes, and the thin, squeaky
voice. All else is curiously symmetrical. The
humorous feature of the entertainment is the
address delivered by the gentleman in charge.
He explains that the exhibit without a doubt
originally came from the Montezuma district of
Mexico, where people like him are to be found in
considerable numbers. The Montezuma district
is good, and corresponds to the Smith district of
England, the MoTavish county of Scotland, and
the O’Grady province of Ireland. The Pixie can
understand English, but he does not speak it very
well, although he is said to be learning it, and he is
credited with now being able to make himself
understood in French. His habits are irreproach-
able, and according to medical testimony he is
about 35 years old, although he declares himself
to be over 40. He is intensely interested in babies,
and he admires a pretty woman. Also he belongs
to the Dwarfs’ Union, which is evidenced by
the fact that about 9.30 he goes on strike,
and refuses to receive any more visitors. After
that he retires to his apartment, sips his toddy,
and smokes a cigarette before turning in. He is
a weird little creature who makes one think very
hard and form new theological theories.

The Sydney Stage Society, which made
such a success of its first production, last year—
Ibsen’s “ Doll’s House” —has in active rehearsal,
for production at the Criterion Theatre on the
afternoon of April 30, Rostand’s “Fantastics”
(“ Les Romanesques ”). This was one of the first
successes of the poet dramatist, whose “ Cyrano
de Bergerac” made him world-famous. A feature
of this production will be the appearance of the
well-known actress. Miss Madge Mclntosh, in the
part of the French Juliet. Miss Mclntosh was
the original heroine in the production of the play
in England. She will, on this occasion, be
strongly supported by a cast including Messrs.
Leslie Casey, George Gilhooley, W. E. Vincent,
R. B. Orchard and Gilbert Nathan. As the aim
of the Stage Society is to produce the best modern
pieces, the performance should attract all lovers
of the drama.

Chung Ling Soo, deceptionist, is the
Sydney Tivoli just now ; and he is going very
strong. The innocent back-blocker watches him
agape ; so does the worldly wise urban resident.
But neither gets any change out of Soo. The
mystery of his tricks remains as obscure as Anti-
Sosh. Baffled and annoyed onlookers depart at
the end of his turn and accuse him of being named
not Chung Soo, but Joe Cook or Bruce Smith or
something. It is the harshest criticism they can
find to level at his turn.

“ Sweet Kitty Bellairs, ” divested of super-
fluous talk and trimmings since the first night, so
as to bring it within the three hours’ radius, pro-
mises to meet the requirements of Nellie
Stewart’s admirers for some weeks. Probably
Belasco’s sunshine-and-rain drama is a better
medium for another Nellie boom than a more
forcible play would have been. Melbourne
wanted its old favorite to look younger than
usual, in a fresh assortment of picturesque gowns,
and she supplies the want. No other inci-
dents in the career of Widow Bellairs are more
exciting than three of her appearances in
triumphant clothes. In a world of well-
dressed people she comes an easy first
up to the time when the breath of slander
tarnishes her fair fame, and her best boy and a
number of her second-best boys leave her with an
aching heart on a horribly wet day. Kitty’s
soldier boys, by-the-bye, remind one of the miners
who worshipped Tittell Brune as Sunday. To
hear those boozy warriors talk to the wealthy
widow, and vice versa , one would think they had
originally found her lying in a parcel on the
doorstep of the barracks and had reared her
on the bottle. If they were a syndicate
of maternal uncles and their family name
was Grundy, they couldn’t take up a higher
moral position when the young woman
bursts upon their astonishment from behind
the curtain of a bachelor’s four-poster bed-
stead. The awful frigidity of their politeness to

Kitty under the circumstances is as unreasonable
as the doglike submission with which that gorge-
ous widow subsequently follows them around.
She’s a high-spirited relict of Bellair’s at the out-
set, ready to bid anybody go to the Divil, but the
bedstead episode, which might be expected to put
her injured innocence on its mettle, breaks her up
intoirely. “Sweet Kitty” is not a play to be
scrutinised in its naked untruthfulness. You
must take it with all its clothes on, and allow for
the fact that its manners were made in Bath.
The merits of the new musical comedy at
Melbourne Royal are summed up in the statement
that no part of the first performance, last Satur-
day night, was more memorable than the accident
to Cromwell’s baggy trousers. Cromwell, by the
way, plays a melancholy waiter in the second act,
when all the characters from the first act come to
an open-air fSte at Baron’s Court Exhibition, and
are served with refreshments at sundry times and
THE GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When William Cromwell split his pants
The public roared with glee ;
The rent in William’s overalls
Revealed to gallery and stalls,
And likewise to d.c.,
A yard of lingerie.
They’d been applauding just before
His droll, eccentric dance,
And now they simply shrieked for more •
The very rafters rang " Encore ! ”
When Cromwell split his,pants—
What ho !
When Cromwell wrecked his pants.
The fact that William wore a shirt
Was plain to every eye ;
A sudden gleam of something white
Was noted with demure delight
By wives who said, “ 0, my ! ”
And set their lips awry ;
Young maidens, blushing fore and aft,
Looked furtively askance
Whilst Dick, and Ton), and Harry laugh’t
Like mortals mad, or going daft.
When Cromwell split his pants—
What ho !
When Cromwell burst his pants.
“The Girl Behind the Counter” seemed
A commonplace success;
The giddy girls, the languid toff,
They wandered on and wandered off,
Attempting, more or less,
To hide their foolishness.
The chorus also did its bit;
The hero of romance
Did stand and sing, or sing and sit;
But no one scored a mighty hit
Till Cromwell split his pants—
What ho !
When Cromwell wrecked his pants.
If works of true dramatic art
Were brought to light of late
They failed, no doubt, to win applause
From Melbourne citizens because
They carried too much weight,
Or were too delicate.
But folks who speak with disrespect
Of better things, perchance,
Will long and lovingly reflect
Upon the unrehearsed effect
Of Cromwell’s broken pants—
What ho !
When Cromwell wrecked his pants.
VICTORIA.

tables bv the waiter aforesaid. Incidentally they
sing and dance —in couples as a rule and the
chorus troops on to their assistance when re-
quired. The second act is little else than a suc-
cession of irrelevant musical “turns, with
brief intervals for dialogue and refreshment.
The first act leads up to the story, but the
story is left out. Its scene is laid in an
extraordinary drapery store, where a gouty
general and his massive wife are charged oos. tor
a light luncheon, and their only daughter engages
herself to manage the flower stall. Lady cus-
tomers walk around the shop with their parasols
up, and a languid lord in a plum-colored suit
dallies with the manageress. Also a young mil-
lionaire arrives there from West Africa, and
champions the General’s daughter when she is
discharged on suspicion of stealing a fiver from
the cash d-fisk. The office boy (lorn Payne)
pinches the fiver and spends it royally on the lady
cashier, Essie Perrin, who costs him so much
money that his felony is discovered, and the
General’s daughter is able to marry the million-
aire without a stain on her character. It must be
admitted that “The Girl Behind the Counter” is
not utterly destitute of plot. The plot amounts
only to a fly-speck on a libretto which makes no
odds to the entertainment, but it certainly exists.

The efforts of the Meynell and Gunn co.
suffice to keep this fragile musical comedy from
nervous collapse. The performance, though not
very strong in any respect, is strong enough for
that. Cromwell as the pessimistic hireling, and
Edwin Brett, as the elderly military buffoon,
seeking unholy relaxation from the attentions of
his stupendous spouse, are satisfactory in their
way, whilst Tom Payne and Miss Perrin are
equally satisfactory in their way. The young
lady, with her bonnie appearance and graceful
dancing, would be altogether charming if she
dropped her pert affectations of speech and let
herself go as a soubrette ingenue. There’s no sug-
gestion of girlish sentimentality in her per-
formances. She is naturally beautiful without
being beautifully natural. Miss Ruth Lincoln
adds nothing to the value of her mild, colorless
character by singing a colorless waltz song
in the second act, and Miss Orford, as the mash
of the plum-colored lord, appears to be getting
hopelessly artificial and demonstratively mincing
in her manner. Hers is the vivacity of a pro-
vincial milliner at a tea party. Roland Bottomley
is feeble but humorous enough as the languid
lord, and Harold Thorley makes his Australian
re-appearance in a tall, manly part that plays
itself. But his singing on Saturday night was
harsh and throaty. Others who might be brighter
are Miss Rose, the bounteous Miss Daisy Belmore,
and J. Paulton, the latter an exceptionally weak
sketch of a palatial-shopkeeper. Goatcher’s
scenery and a tuneful decorative chorus will help
to-give “The Girl Behind The Counter” a fair
run. The music is not brilliant or specially
“ catchy,” but it has some go in it.

At; Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the star of
“ The Girl of the Golden West ” is setting in the
east, and after Friday she will sell no more drinks
at famine prices. Miss Brune, as The Girl, gets
all the profits of the business, and sacrifices an
uncommonly good “joint” when she goes away ;
but in her next character she is the weary slave
who throws up her servitude to enjoy a month’s
burst. “ Diana of Dobson’s,” the comedy that is
due next Saturday (24th), differs from “The. Girl’’
even as a silver eel differs from a brazen serpent,
or even more so. Melbourne has heard only of
“ Dobson’s ” as a place where at least one nice girl
sheds her bodices and things and assumes her
frilly “ nighty ” in view of the audience. The
story, however, is something more than a comedy
of underwear, and it has many points of interest
for the intelligent, including the first Melbourne
appearance of Mrs. Brough with this particular co.

Intended, maybe, as a topical reference
to the fast-dying passion of Dread-O-ism, “The
Mariners of England” was revived at Melbourne
King’s on Saturday. The play is much more
tolerable than the conventional Andersonian hys-
teria. but it has too many bellowdramatic impro-
prieties to carry cold criticism by storm. Except-
ing the su pern at u rally lovely character of
Nelson, the other figures are mainly the
brazen and familiar oddities of every yello-
drama. There is Captain Lebaudy, a gentleman
of insalubrious tastes, who evades certain pre-
maternity claims. There is Harry Dell, a mas-
querading archangel with a mania for manliness.
There is a doddering ex-paladin crooning piffle
about Nelson. There is a frankly erotic young
woman who humps “a wrong.” There is her
opposite, sweet and godly, who almost becomes a
rite. There are sundry preposterous sea-dogs and
sojers in insubordinate raiment; besides village
idiots and othercrimesof comic relief. These things
occur at times with such fury and unreason that
the play takes on the character of a burlesque.
Nelson, as impersonated by Harry Diver, is about
the only person in the piece who is entitled to
entire respect. Diver plays “ England’s darling”
imposingly. Yet Diver’s interesting and respect-
able work only accentuates the brilliant common-
placeness of most of the others. Certainly
Vivian Edwards makes a loud, but fairly accept-
able Harry Dell; Miss Kate Gair acts winsomely
as Mabel Talbot; and Miss Fanny Erris is slight,
but vivacious, as Polly Appleyard. The re-
mainder seem to be endeavoring to bludgeon one
into stupefaction. ♦

Three extra concerts by the Cherniavskis
—the eldest of whom has graduated from knickers
to pants since they first visited Melbourne—will
eventuate at the Town Hall this week. Two of
the concerts have, in fact, already joined the
majority, but the third and last opportunity of
hearing the musical trio will present itself on
Friday afternoon. Serious musical critics have
stated that the alleged genius of the ornate
brethren is suffering from premature expression
on public platforms. To the present writer, then-
actual performances sound better than they
sounded last year, and the pained aspect of
brother Leo as he shrugs his shoulders at his
fiddle looks more soulful than ever.

Another art film of considerable dramatic
interest cantered across the bedding at Melbourne
Olympia last Saturday night. “The Gun-Shot,”
depicts with something approaching vividness
the grief of parents whose only child has been
accidentally shot by the father. It is a rather
weepy and tragical story. The much more im-
pressive picture of Ulysses is also scooting across
the cloth for one or two more nights. It is a
superior film with nice girls in it. At the Glaci-
arium the chief event of Saturday’s meeting was
an exploit of D’Artagnan of “The Three Mus-
keteers.” Also flickered on Saturday: “Winter
Sports at Stockholm,'’ “The Mad Woman’s
Child,” a story of blud and gipsies ; and “ Yoko-
hama to Kyoto,” one of the most attractive pictures
of Jap life and scenery that The Bulletin has
seen to date.

The Laurels are the latest arrivals at
Melbourne Opera House. There are three lissome
Laurels, and they bound wildly from an elastic
ping-pong table, and perform rather astonishing
feats with belltopper hats, after the mannerof other
acrobats who worked for Rickards in the long ago.
G. W. Hunter, Cissie Curlette, and many items
as before seem to be repeating themselves until
further notice; but the Jap jiu-jitsuisms are about
to quit the scene of their unsportsmanlike contests.

There has been a controversy about “The
Duke’s Motto,” which has run a successful week
at Adelaide Royal. It claims to be a new play by
Justin Huntley McCarthy, whereas the Oldest
Inhabitant remembers seeing it played locally
about 18(55. The truth, of course, is that
J.H.McC. has simply prepared a new version
of an old French original (Lewis Waller is playing
a brand-new version of the aged “Musketeers”
in London at this moment). It is a pity the
author, or adapter, did not quite make up his
mind what he was aiming at. The story defies
probability so recklessly that it might just as well
have had a lot more thrills to the acre. For
example, two-and-a-half acts of careful and
not over-tbrillsome plotting and disguise of
the hero are thrown away when, free at last
to depart quietly with his girl, he announces
his real name—and escapes death only by the
accident of the king’s entrance. At present Miss
Beatrice Day, as a somewhat matronly Mercia,
is being chased round the Early Christian furni-
ture by the same old Julius Superbus; the play
seems to stamp itself more and more as the plain
melodrama which Wilson Barrett earnestly
assured this writer it wasn’t. At the Tivoli, the
Kell vs are giving a clever stockwhip turn ; and
the Pierrots, having come in out of the cold of
Glenelg beach, are doing a round of suburban
halls—with their admission prices un wisely
trebled and quadrupled.
AT POVERTY POINT.
It seems that Miss Rosslyn Vane, of the Nellie Stewart
co., now at Melbourne Princess’s, is in a most terrible
position. Speaking' to an intellectual interviewer from a
Melbourne society paper, she asserted that she had
travelled all the way to Australia without her doggie, an
animal that lurks pnder the nom-de-bowwow of Tootles,
or Lassie, or something. But the absence of her cherished
mastiff, or whatever it is, explains only a portion of the
full infamy of her lonely exile. If she could but replace
the absent Tootles, etc., by a casual understudy, it
would not be so bad. But she dare not. If she purchased
or even borrowed a temporary dog in Australia, the
animal would wrap itself round her affections and she
wouldn’t be able to part with it. Then she would have
two dogs, which would be a dog too many. Besides,
when the dogs met they might not agree. Therefore the
lady says she will be true to her old previous dog. By
the way', the interviewer says there is “ a hint of slumber-
ing fire” hanging out its shingle on “her peculiarly
refined features.” Should she burst into flame she might
be better without a dog. Some dogs—the hairy sort—
are very combustible. Besides, the average small dog
becomes hysterical and g-ets in the road when its mistress
is on fire, and she falls over it while rushing to the
bathroom, and the delay is often fatal.
“Stargazer” : Nellie Stewart’s first night at Melbourne
Princess’s was practically' a hen convention. I examined
the collection carefully', and man averaged one in thirty.
In the pictures of the early-door crush the male element
is conspicuous by its absence. Even in the dress circle,
where one pa usually goes to an overflowing ma and three
she offsprings, pa was barred on this occasion. It was the
same with the stalls. The gallery' was packed with girls,
and how those girls had fought for their places ! They
stormed the heights at about six o’clock, and began to
tumble into the front seats, the most torn, beaten, broken,
breathless and dishevelled swamp of nice demoiselles I have
ever seen. Not one was without damage. Blouses were
ripped and split, skirts were torn from their moorings,
sleeves were dragged clean out, belts were broken or lost,
and hair was all over the place. I counted seven fainting
women on the seats, and twice as many' “all out,” being
attended to by their friends. Two-thirds of the remainder
had their golden locks hanging round them, and were
busy'trying to skewer them into bundles again. On the
stone stairs you might have swept up a bushel of hair-
pins and a bale of ribbons and other fragments. Simple
citizens who retain sentimental notions about the gentle-
ness of the sex should have seen that inverted Niagtira of
skirt dropping up the Princess’s back tracks.
Beerbohm Tree’s revival of “The School for Scandal,’’due
in London this month, is to have a star cast such as is
usually got together only' for a benefit. Tree himself
takes Sir Peter, with Marie Lohr as Lady Teazle. But the
chief interest lies in the veterans that Tree has tempted
out of retirement to play' in support; Sir Oliver, Henr,y
Neville ; Crabtree, Edward Terry'; Moses, Lionel Brough ;
and old Rowley', Hermann Yezin—who is just 80.
There was a lively' lot of unexpected noise in Melbourne
Royal one night at the tail end of the panto. A woman
came up the circle stairs with fire in her eye, and snorting
like a startled horse. She overthrew the doorkeeper,
rushed into the circle, scattered a glance round, and fell
on to a stout decorous citizen in sedate evening dress,
who was seated between two young women of genteel
raiment and modest demeanor. Having dropped on him,
she proceeded to give him a shocking rough-up. The
stout cit. tore himself free, bent on avoiding public con-
tumely, and fled into the cloak-room. There vengeance
overtook him, and clawed his hair and whiskers. The
avenger was heard to say'that she would teach him to
take strange persons to theatres, leaving his lawful wife
at home darning hose. Finally' she ran the poor man
down the stairs, and batted him out on to the Bourke-
street pavement, where he called in a broken voice for a
cab.
“S.S,” : I see George Cross’s portrait in a recent
Bulletin. George looks it. Why is George cross? No
melodramatic actor we have had takes his melodramming
so seriously as Billanderson’s late lead. George might
bear his Cross patiently'. The audiences do.
Harold Thorley, the tall, slim baritone who has come
back to Australia: under engagement to Meynell and
(Junn, is remembered for one specially good bit of work
in a J.O. W. production, sonic five or six years ago. He
played a lord of the Georgian period in a quiet, little
comic opera called “My Lady Molly”—a showy, walking
gentleman part, with a couple of rattling good songs to
it. As the successor to Wallace Brownlow, the new man
(Thorley) had seemed rather stiff and tame in musical
comedy; but the character in “ My Lady Molly ” suited
his personality and gave his voice a capital chance. It
must have been soon aft-r then that he finished his
engagement with Williamson and returned to England,
and from the Cold Country came bad accounts of his
health. Apparently Thorley shook off his lung complaint
and got his voice back to its best form. The writer heard
him sing one or two ballads, at the Empire in London, 12
months ago, when there wasn’t much the matter with his
delic .te chest, judging from his top note.
“ Harrison O.” : The latest bad joke that has been per-
petrated by the Cold Country censor of plays has caused
a fresh outbreak of indignation in literary circles. Said
censor has written to Pelissier, the manager of the Lon-
don “Pollies,” informing him that no skit upon “An
Englishman’s Home ” will be passed by the Lord Cham-
berlain. At present Pelissier's “Folly’’show is one of
the redeeming features of London. It is always bright,
clever, witty and healthy. It satirises the absurdities of
the hour. Lewis Waller, Hall Caine and Marie Corelli
have their faults and vanities humorously, but good-
naturedly, exposed and satirised by the clever “ Pollies.”
Pelissier has either written or produced burlesques upon
pretty well every play of note (or notoriety) that has hap-
pened in the Big Fog of late years. In exposing to
ridicule such heart-breaking episodes as “ The Christian,”
he has been nothing short of a public benefactor. He had
a skit on “An Englishman’s Home ” ready for production
when the censor’s absurd note arrived. In said skit he
pictured the Germans invading England and marching
upon Brown’s villa only to find that Brow n is a German. So
are all the other Browns that the invaders can discover,
likewise the Smiths and Robinsons. The German indus-
trial invasion had preceded the military one, and the
British people were extinct without knowing it.
“S.S.”: Consider the melodramatic jerry-builder, how
he makes his thrilling situations. “Swear!” says the
long, lanky, cat-whiskered villain in “ The French Spy.”
The lean iniquity has a praying desk and a crucifix in his
roam for swearing- contingencies, and Eugenie Duggan de
Loriac ter-r-r-embles. “Ser-wear!” says the villain,
and the lady totters to the swearing apparatus, and
attests that when she sees the man who throttled the
bloke she will give him up to Russian justice. The
moment arrives. “ Re-mem-bair you ha-oath!” hisses
the angular villain. “ I re-mem-bair,” whispers the lady.
“ When I see him I will de-nounce heem.” “ Then speak,
carseyou!” The heroine loves the man who throttled
the bloke. She takes a phial from her pocket, pours half a
pint of poison in h r eyes, and shrieks: “ I have kept my
oath! I cannot see heem—l am be-lind!” Curtain.
Howls, stamps, roars of popular delight. And yet the
lady might have shut her eyes to avoid seeing “heem.”
But simple expedients are the curse of the popular
playwright.
It is curious how the great Foreign-trade dailies care-
fully refrain from giving Australasia credit for anything if
it can possibly be avoided. Miss Marjorie Tempest gave
a concert at Sydney Y.M.C. A. Hall on Saturday week,
and Sydney Telegraph described the lady as “astray
comet in the musical firmament,” and spoke
of her as “ the accomplished English artist.”
The lady is a beautiful singer and one whom
any country might be proud of producing. The
curious part of the business is that the Tele-
graph report contained no hint that she is an
Australasian. “ The accomplished English
artist ” is a Maoriland girl who received the
bulk of her musical training in Sydney at
the studio of that reliable Sydney teacher, Mr.
Desjardin. Five years ago she left him to
finish in Europe. This careful suppression of
the lady’fi Australasian origin, and of the
naturalised Australian teacher who laid the
foundations of her beautiful voice is very re-
prehensible on the part of a great daily that
howls so strenuously about patriotism and
our duty to our country.
Herman Vezin, the Shaksperian actor, has
just celebrated his 80th birthday. He was born
in Philadelphia (U.S. A.), His father was a Ger-
man, his mother of French descent. Both were
naturalised Yankees. He is an educated man,
with a university degree, and made his first
stage a-'pearance with Mr. and Mrs. Charles
Kean in London. In 1863 he married the Aus-
tralian actress, Mrs. Charles Young, who was
born Thompson and christened Jane. She
had divorced the comedian, Charles Young, a
couple of years previously. She married
Young in Tasmania when she was but 16 years of age.
“Star”: Melbourne papers say that Miss Eugenie
Duggan intends to take advantage of her European trip
to study Bernhardt and Duse and other great actresses.
I hate this Australian humility 7. The lady is going away
to give Sara and Duse and others opportunities of study-
ing Eug-enie Duggan.
“Cockaigne”: Before me is the book of Faust, as pro-
duced by Beerbohm Tree, with the Australienne Marie
Lohr, daughter of Dad, culling all the laurels. The book
is a cobble, not worth publishing. Tree ought to have
given Wills’s version, the greatest monetary success in
Irving’s career. Yet that became a claptrap pantomime.
Tree starts for a better thing, but worries you worse.
The basis is fresh translation of Goethe by Phillips, quite
unworthy of him. There are about forty English
translations of Faust. Far better to have adopted
Anna Swanwick or Bayard Taylor, instead of
Phillips trying the impossibility of being- original. So
he is weak, an irritation in most of the familiar
passages. Then Comyns-Carr has tinkered it over from a
dramatic standpoint. Lastly, Beerbohm Tree has come
in, with his finicking- ideas. He is the molluscous actor,
trying to stamp thought, like Irving, and yet only being
quaint. First comes the Heavenly Prologue, with three
lady Archang-els, and no Lord, not even through a speak-
ing-trumpet, as in “Mose in Egitto.” Tree, with his
absurd subtleties, tries to distinguish, by a rapid change
of garb and manner, between Satan and his incarnation
or avatar as Mephisto. The Apotheosis of Faust, at the
last, is, of course, correct, but absuidly nailed on to the
death of Marg-aret. You can see great ideas weltering-
through this Phillips-Carr-Tree jumble, but it drops flat.
Henrietta Watson, lately prominent in middle-aged
parts in London, and formerly quite the best Glory
Quayle that Australia ever saw—Australia still remem-
bers how she let down her innumerable hair and said,
“Kiss me, John!” —has lost her husband. In private
life she is Mrs. Thornton Radcliffe.
One of the leading girls in this year’s panto at Drury
Lane (London) carries the absurd name of Truly Shattuck.
“ Truth ” and “True ” are permissible names for a human
noun in the first person singular; but “Truly”! The
girl isn’t an adverb.
The most effective resultof the Suffragette disturbances
in England has been the forming of an Actresses’ Franchise
League, with Mrs. Kendal for president and Miss Gertrude
Elliott (who was a member of Nat Goodwin’s co. in Aus-
tralia years ago) as a leading light. Even the stupidest
old Tory has to admit that a popular actress is a more
intelligent person than the average male voter. Also he
perceives the absurdity of denying her the franchise on
the ground that “a woman’s proper place is her home.”
His cant phrase sticks in the throat of the lord of creation
who is discussing Bernhardt’s latest production at his
domestic tea table, or feasting his eyes on the popular
legs of a “ principal boy” at the panto. In the face of
his favorite mummeress the hard-shell Tory drops his
argument against the extension of the franchise to women.
If she can earn a large salary and support a young family
by appearing on the stage and Stopping out late at night,
it is evident to the slowest understanding that her
proper place isn’t at home. The leagued actresses are the
most forcible champions that the suffragettes have secured
in London. At their first meeting the other week one of
the speakers remarked that the people who wouldn’t let
a woman leave her “ home ” to record a vote “seemed
to look upon the ballot-box as a sort of residential club,”
and as for the silly objection that she wouldn’t know
what to do with a vote if she had one, they 7 might as well
protest that she wouldn’t know what to do with a baby.
“0.K.” : In “The Girl of the Golden West ” there’s an
allusion to Joe Miller which indicates that the public of
America (where the play was born) is supposed to be
familiar with the name and meaning- of Joseph aforesaid.
To an Australian audience, seemingly, Joe AJiHer hasn’t a
more distinctive personality than Bill Smith. Nobody
understands the allusion when one of the characters reads
something that isn’t funny from a book of “Old Joe
Miller’s Jokes," as he calls it. In America the audience
would mostly laugh at any mention of such a book, and
it was to raise a laugh that the dramatist dragged
in the name of Miller in connection with jokes.
But evidently Belasco is unacquainted with the
real origin of the Knglish term, “a Joe Miller”
or “a Joe Millerism.” So he didn’t quite know
what he was expecting the audiences to laugh at. In
the first place, no Californian miner in the 1850 period
would have possessed “Old Joe Miller’s Jokes,” seeing
that there never was a volume of alleged humor published
under that title. In the next place, he couldn’t have ex-
tracted from a bona-fide book of “ Millerisms ” any such
stuff as the miner in Belasco’s drama reads aloud to the
girl in the schoolroom of her pub. “Joe Miller’s Jests, or
the Wits’Vade Mecum”is about 180 years old, and the
anecdotes contained in it are older than that. It appeared
after the death of the man who collected the stories, and
told them to the admiring friend who brought them to
print. The friend was another Boswell to a Boswell.
Miller was the hero of only a few of the stories known as
“Millerisms.” The others he gathered from the coffee-
houses of the period, and repeated to the historian.
Doubtless they were considered droll at the time. Some
of the very obscene stories, reset in modern phraseology,
would raise a smoking-room laugh even nowadays.
For the rest, they were harmless and anecdotal,
having their point in a repartee. The pompous
stilted style of the wording was not absurd when Joe
Miller’s jests were young, or for 50 years afterwards, but
when it became obsolete, and the “Jests” had been done
to death in repetition, the term “Millerism” acquired a
new significance. It meant an intolerably dull and stale
story —a treasured heirloom in the family of a stupid
person. A bore posing as a humorous raconteur was con-
temptuously referred to as a retailer of “ Joe Millers,”
although his stories might not have been borrowed from
the book. Hence the old idea, in England and America,
that the original “Joe Miller” jokes were essentially
stupid, whereas there was a gleam of wit in most of them.
The literary form of the anecdotes was heavy (probably
the raconteur told the yarns better than his friend
repeated them in print), but they' were not point-
less. The book of “Jests” became ridiculous a century
ago, not because its literary form was old-fashioned, but
because dull people had accepted it as “The Wits’ Vade
Mecum,” and had swallowed the little yarns in order to
cough them up for the entertainment of their friends.
The original book had a great vogue among middle-class
readers ; it was reprinted minus the obscene stories and
plus 2 00 or 300 new ones written in the same style as the
first lot. The spurious “Joe Millers” were more flabby
and prosy than the genuine ones, and it was this enlarged
edition, already out-of-date in design, which gave Joe a
new lease of notoriety'. The humor of the publication lay
in its pretensions to be a book of study for wits. Its
“jests” had ceased to amuse intelligent people, but its
popularity was treated as a joke. Therefore when the
miner reads extracts from old Joe Miller’s Book of Jokes
to the Girl of the Golden West, the Australian audience
is expected to smile.

“O.K.”: Possibly I am peculiar in my distaste for
trick-bicycling performances at the vaudeville shows.
They interested me years ago, when the Selbinis came to
Australia, and everybody sat amazed at the cleverness of
Miss Laura Selbini in wobbling around the stage,on one
wheel. Now that the art of travelling easily on one
wheel is common among trick cyclists, and the best per-
formers achieve feats which the Selbinis never thought of,
I find a bicycle “act ’’the dullest item in the Rickards’pro-
gramme. The abnormal feats of these acrobatic wheelists
are not beautiful as a rule. They have ceased to be sur-
prising. There is no entertainment in them for the
hardened show-goer. A mediocre gymnastic or juggling
performance, gracefully accomplished, is, to my mind,
more pleasing than the most difficult feat of balancing-
and ingenious pedal-pushing on a bike.
“E.F.”: Although a strong suspicion of pretentious
fraud attaches to the “Salome” dance as a work of art,
nobody doubts that Maud Allan, who originated it, takes
herself seriously. Lately she delivered a discourse on
“Classical Dancing” at a theatrical club in London. Her
hearers laughed, and the chairman, in thanking,the lady
for her lecture, politely intimated that it was mostly non-
sense, but the verdict of the club was that Miss Allan
believed what she said. She said among other things
that “dancing is the spontaneous expression of the
spiritual state, and the modern ballet has distorted,
strained and disorganised dancing by elevating and
elaborating technique until natural grace is swamped—
utterly swamped.” And she furthermore alleged that
“ballet at its highest stamped with its pathetic
wickedness the decadence of nations.” All of which
boils down to the simple fact that Maud naturally
snorts at educated dancing, in which she is not proficient,
and sincerely admires the carefully-rehearsed posturing
which she calls dancing, and which, through a combina-
tion of circumstances, has brought her into lucrative
notoriety. Dancing, as common-sense understands the
word, is “ the poetry of lively motion.” A minuet is not
a dance. The danseuse who aspires to something better
than mere high kicking is always striving to effect a rapid
succession of graceful poses. Any naturally graceful
woman can go through a series of graceful, slow move-
ments, or strike a series of picturesque attitudes, but she
can’t do them at dancing speed. She can’t even run
gracefully until she has been well schooled. To be a great
dancer she must twist, twirl, leap, bound, and come
to a standstill with an easy elegance that looks
spontaneous, otherwise it wouldn’t be -graceful. Limbs,
body and head must be posed in harmony with every
dance movement, and then the beauty of the movement
increases with the rapidity of it. The perfected pirouette,
which is a lightning twirl on the tip of the tbes, is the
finest poetry of motion that art has discovered. The
artist performs it as though by sudden inspiration. But
it cost her years of arduous training. She is the com-
plete dancer. The comparatively amateurish amblings
and posturings of bare-footed Maud Allan would be
child’s play to her. She would “walk through” that
sort of dance more spontaneously than Maud A. can,
whereas the Salome lady couldn’t attempt to imitate the
graceful feats of the expert artist. Still the Salome lady
is credited with a sincere belief in the frauds she perpe-
trates on the public.

THE SONGS OF THE SIRENS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What were the songs that the Sirens sang,
When over the waters their voices rang,
Echoing from sirenian caves
’Cross the tempestuous, foam-capped waves?
What luring songs did Ulysses hear?
What wiles did the Trojan hero fear ?
Loud did the Sirens’ voices ring !
Harmonies subtle, the Sirens sing ;
Borne on the winds from across the sea
There floats an entrancing melody ;
Like the piping of the flute of Pan,
The wild song captures the soul of Man.
They' sing of riotous Pagan joy,
Telling of Pleasure without alloy ;
A radiant day they make of night,
A radiant day they' make more bright.
To their hearers the notes for ever cling,
The passionate notes the Sirens sing.

EDITOR OF JINGO RAG (to office boy): "Hurry

take longer than a Dreadnought subscription
to come in.”
Vague but scarifying item from Newcastle
Herald (17/4/’09)
AS I think myself above accepting Mr. M. Hoolahan’s
challenge, and as I was not a competitor at the
Singing Competition at the Railway Picnic (but my
sister, Miss Ruby), as my musical record demands me
a higher standard. But, if a sufficient inducement
were offered, I may be able to give Miss Hoolahan a
few lessons, which she is in need of very much.

The other day a Sydney magistrate agreed
to suspend sentence on a female culprit because a
“ bloke ” promised to marry her. and added that
if marriaee really eventuated nothin" more would
be said about the sentence. And thereby he re-
produced the methods of Sydnej' in its infancy.
Female delinquents who were brought before the
very early Justices were regularly bought off
by the blokes of the period, they (the blokes)
testifying their intention of marrying the culprits.
But the Bench of that period used to say, “Well,
lest you change your mind I’ll marry you at
once.” Thrifty squatters on a small scale—men
with a couple of dozen cows to milk —used to
attend the courts and inspect the teeth and the
muscles of the women culprits. Then when the
early cow-feeder had selected a young, vigorous
and handsome criminal, he would hand to the
Bench a statement of his assets and a declaration
that he was willing to take the defendant for better
or worse. As a rule the lady accepted the situation.
If she didn’t, the Court sometimes got wild and
ordered her to be whipped.

He is a mighty poor kind of patriot who
gives a cheque to a British Dreadnought fund
with one hand, and with the other holds back the
employee who wants to get away for a few days
training to qualify him for the defence of Aus-
tralia. Yet Sydney owns a large number of these
money-blind, pass-book upholders of the empire.
Apropos of the poor attendance at the Easter
camps, the Telegkaph (10/4/’O9) indignantly re-
marked as follows:
Many circumstances operate against the full attendance
of members of the militia units. Sick leave certificates
account for many of the absentees, but unhappily again
this year the complaint is heard that employers are loth
to let their employees get away to attend the camp, and
some of the largest employers of labor in Sydney are the
worst offenders in this respect. In these days, when
defence is a perilously serious question, the diffidence of
merchants and others is very adversely commented upon,
and the opinion is freely expressed among senior officers
of the citizen forces that if the obnoxious system of com-
pulsion is introduced, the employers who suffer incon-
venience in consequence of young men being taken away
from their employment will have only themselves to
thank.
The bloated trader’s pathetic belief in his bank
and the discs of metal stored therein is one of
life’s persistent tragedies. Because he will do
anything for money, he comes in time to believe
that money' will do anything for him. The possi-
bility of cash becoming valueless in certain des-
perate circumstances is utterly beyond his com-
prehension ; in fact, it would be difficult to
convince some traders that men may be worth
more than money until the bayonets of the
invader came thrusting over the calico rolls on the
counter ; in which case he might regret with his
last gasp that he hadn’t allowed Jones of the
Haberdashery and Brown of the Gloves to pro-
ceed occasionally to camp for training in the art
of war. This shortage in the ranks comes oppor-
tunely, for it allows a chance to contrast the
paper patriotism of cheques and the real variety.
Also, it emphasises the fact that training must be
made universal and compulsory. The compulsion
won’t be needed for the prospective soldiers ; it
will be needed for the cheque-writing patriot in
the private office who labors under the delusion
that his duty and the duty of all his staff towards
the national safety has been done when he has
advertised himself by dropping a few odd pounds
into a Dreadnought fund.

“Railroader”: In addition to his mania
for dealing with Melbourne’s suburban traffic by
means of long, heavy, and infre-
quent trains in place of short trains
and a frequent and easily-handled
service, Vic. Commissioner Tait is
now alleged to suffer from an in-
tention to replace the existing car-
riage doors by sliding doors. These,
it is said, will allow hirn to build
carriages two feet wider, which means
28 more passengers per carriage. It
looks a good enough idea at first
blush ; but there are drawbacks.
Every platform will have to be re-
built, which will cost a lot; and as it
will take a good many years to use
up the present stock of carriages,
passengers who want to get in or
out of them will, presumably, have
to leap over the gap, at considerable
risk of leaping under the train. Still,
if Tait can get his drivers into the
way of starting the trains with a
sudden jerk, the sliding doors may
possibly close themselves, and that
will enable him to do away with at
least half a porter at each busy sta-
tion. And Tait simply has to re-
trench on porters ; at the rate they
are being used up at present the avail-
able stock will be dead in a few years.

St. Francis’ R. C. church and school, the first tabernacle
that the country visitor strikes when he toboggans down
by tram from the precipitous Sydney railway station, has
been resumed by the Oity Council. The site was origi-
nally the Sydney pound and cattleyards. The church
w-as built in the early ’sixties, and the school-hall
in 1872. Dean John Felix Sheridan, its first
priest, was a great accumulator of church pro-
perty. He built the Good Shepherd Convent, near the
new railway station ; also he bought Charles Nicholson’s
old home in Victoria-street for the Sisters, and began to
develop itinto St. Vincent’s Hospital. Years later he died
at Kincumber, where he had established an orphannge.
The presbytery in Castlereagh-street, still standing and
used as a lodging house, was originally the home of
William Macpherson, Clerk of the Legislative Assembly.

The attack—as seen from South Head by
the Religious Editor and friend :
We leaned against the fenee that runs along' the ex-
treme edge of the cliffs and watched the searchlights
playing on the sea. Far below, the ocean sighed and
sobbed against the front-door of Australia like an ex-
hausted and hysterical bailiff who had been trying for
40,000 years to get in and distrain on the furniture ; but,
secure on the roof of the continent, we stared silentl}- as
the great military lights, like funnels of silver mist,
roamed over the water looking- for the enemy. The big
one on South Head glared fixedly at North Head until an
immense circular patch of cliff stood out from the sur-
rounding gloom like the bull’s eye of a target a mile
square. When the blazing- eye swung round to take
another view, and the light ran at an immense speed
along the shore-line, it looked like the last joint of the
departed day's tail making a plucky effort to catch up to
the rest of the botjy. As it sweptalongit lit up the cliffs,
and the foam at their hard, horny feet blazed for an
instant into publicity and again retired from public life.
The end of the funnel was clearly defined while the cliff
acted the part of tiie cinematograph sheet; but, directly
North Head was passed, the light broke and spilled
hopelessly out on the dark ocean. On such occasions,
it seemed as badly lost as a thimbleful of whisky in a
gallon of water. We watched the display and waited for
the attack ; and, from crevicesof the rocks, hidden lovers
murmured admiringly like talking oysters. At last, the
big light on South Head swung round and blazed full
upon the little steamer Miner steaming towards the en-
trance with two toy targets foaming along behind. From
our perch on the cliffs we could look right down on to its
deck and the electrically-lighted lane of green sea along
which it was proudly towing. We waited for the crash
of the guns, and stared wildly at the two bobbing objects
round which the plunging shells would splash up dazzling
white columns of spray. Occasionally we glanced ex-
pectantly at the towering black cliffs whence the flashes
and deafening reports would come. Those flashes, and
reports didn’t arrive. The Miner toiled slowly into the
Harbor; and the immensely powerful lights showed it
the way like fussy women showing- a new lodger to his
room. Nothing blazed, exploded, shattered, fell down,
leaped up, sing-ed, smoked, or smelt. But, when every-
one was on the way home, there were a few small streaks
of fire from George’s Head and Green Point, and some
faint explosive sounds that suggested a small, dispirited
hoy letting off some old crackers. It may have been
effective from a military standpoint; but to me it seemed
dreadfully furtive and futile. I expected a row some-
thing like 92 elephants falling downstairs.

Service Association, which has been a dormant or
moribund Ass. for some time, is threatening, 1
see, to assemble itself in force over this proposed
Dreadnought business. Then there will be the
usual idea of a subscription, and lists will he sent
round to the departments. The chief will dash
down his name on the top, and then everyone else
will sign, and, after all have signed, the list will
go back to the chief, and he will notice who has
paid and who hasn’t. Well, as for me, I won’t
sign. Wade is against the idea. I don’t always
follow Wade, but on this Occasion Wade and I are
brothers. But most of the men will sign. There
is an idea that the man who stands out in a case
like this is “marked.” I don’t think so myself,
but I know that many civil servants think so.
Just to find out how many think so, let the
Public Service Ass. refrain from sending round
lists which will come under the eye of the depart-

he sent to the Ass. office. Then let it compare
the result with that of some previous efforts, and
do a subtraction sum on the back of an envelope.
Finally, let it scratch its head hard.
THE MOTOR-KNIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Friday Afternoon.—As a precaution in the
event of invasion, the War Office has arranged to secure
2000 taxi-cabs in London for the transport of 10,000 troops
to the coast. — Cable.
“To cab ! To cab ! ” The cry went up.
The warrior uprose ;
lie took tlie brimming stirrup-cup
And drank unto his foes.
“To cab ! To cab !” the townsmen shrieked,
And leaped up' n the curb.
(And then, because the d d thing leaked,
The chauffeur did disturb
The knight’s farewell with language bad).
Sitting his car before,
He marred—that wretched oily lad—
The majesty of War.
“To cab, thou sluggard !” cried the mob,
“ Toot forth and meet the foe ! ”
From ’neath the cab there came a sob,
“ Tit blanky thing won't go !”
Purple with rage, the waiting lord
Gritted his gold-stuffed teeth,
And prodded with his father’s sword
The varlet underneath.
“ Thou base-born hound ! Awake, I say,
Thy stinking chariot,
Or thou wilt lie as dead this day
As J. Iscariot ! ”
The chauffeur lay beneath the wheels
With a wild, desp’rate stare ;
The dust was on his waving heels,
The petrol in his hair.
Yet, undismayed, he bravely spurned
The knight’s terrific rage,
Till, with his sword, the noble turned
That unsuccessful page
And thrashed him with the knightly blade
That he so proudly wore,
For knowing not his stinking trade,
And keeping him from war.
That eve when late editions told
The story of the fight,
The charger in his stable rolled
And neighed in shrill delight.
And now the war-horse, old and frail,
Whene’er they speak of war,
Perks up and tells the hallowed tale
Over the oats and straw.

Members of the Nimrod exploring party observed that
their stomachs, in accommodating- themselves to the new
conditions, actually contracted because of the small
allowance of food.

And some excellent things it has done !
It has proved that the temp’rature's less at the Pole
Than it is about Latitude One !
It is useful to know the Equator is not
Like the Eighty-first South parallel!
And that scanty-fed stomachs will shrink quite a lot,
While an overfed stomach will swell 1
I had always believed that abstention from food
Made a person disgustingly fat,
And that gluttonous gorging, persisted in, would
Make the stoutest as poor as a rat!

As the poor little moles in their holes)
The great benefit done to the mass of mankind
By discoveries made at the Poles !

franchise, it is a foregone conclusion that
the women’s vote will be on the side of
progress —quality and not quantity of mem-
bers. We see it in everyday life—there
are three women to-day using Sunlight
Soap for laundry and housework to one
using any other scap in the world. Why?
Because women quickly recognise quality,
and the progress effected by the Sunlight
V'itycflf washing described on the cardbox ot
itablet. Try Sunlight Soap next wash
day tmilyou will vote there is nothing better.

309-311 George Street, Sydney,
Architect Sulman, of Sydney, has gorgeous
ideas about the improvement of the city. Last
week the whole of one side of the Telegraph
broke out into a picture, which looked like the
Coliseum on top of the Pantheon, with the
Temple of Jerusalem thrown in. There was a
pond in front of the palatial outbreak, and in it
floated a Dreadnought. This, it transpired, was
the railway station improved by Sulman.
Another of Sulman’s schemes is to make life
easier for the'*Lands Department man who travels
on the Mosman boat. He proposes to bodily
remove the Customs House, to wipe out all the
buildings at the back of it, and to make a street
270 ft. wide leading straight up to the Lands
Office. Sulman would take his racecourse up as
far as Moore-street, but he is afraid of the cost.
And he has a lot of other ideas, including schemes
for raising Pitt-street and George-street up another
storey each.
A YEOMANRY TRAINING.
SERGEANT-MAJOR: "Now, then, Private Moses,
what are you after? Do you fancy you’re
resting on Abraham’s bosom?”
It has taken just a year for the Murray
State to get in the last of the bills for its awful
Sunshine railway smash. Claims paid on account
of the 44 deaths and 100 or more cases of injury
totalled £124,856 ; then there is the damage to
the rolling stock and permanent way. the cost of
an inquest, a Supreme Court trial and a depart-
mental inquiry. The total comes little short of
£200,000, half the cost of the new central station.
On the other side of the balance-sheet there is the
satisfaction of knowing that the State still
possesses a great railway expert.
“ 0.K.” writes :
Melbourne Age, talking of Mrs. Grundy’s inhumanity
to her less rigidly virtuous sisters, quoted the case of an
orphan girl, employed on a farm, who “ got into trouble
and was packed off to Melbourne by the responsible male
party, and left to discover how cruel the world can lie to
a spinster with a baby in her arms. This case, which
happened to get publicity, was a weak subject for the
Age sermon in comparison with some that present them-
selves to anyone who troubles to collect evidence from
wandering females in distress. There are instances, not
very rare, in which the victim is sacrificed with cold-
blooded deliberateness on the altar of “Family Respecta-
bility.” The writer knows of an unmarried woman, the
eldest of half a dozen sisters (the others being wedded to
neighboring f irmers), who was cast adrift by her
angry parents because, at the age of 35, she had
fallen from her high estate, and the man who pro-
mised to marry her had slunk away to the West.
She went to Melbourne to “hide her shame,” and was
assisted into the Women’s Hospital by a compassionate
matron who accosted her on the street. The heavy’
bucolic parent of melodrama, cursing his cheeild for her
indiscretion, or rather for the consequences of it, is not
at all an over-colored character. He exists, and his wife
is sometimes his partner in inhumanity, among the hard,
uneducated classes who grow rich on the land. As
regards Mrs. Grundy’s leading' dogma, such people are
inflexible. They recognise only one sort of disgrace to
the clan —viz., an unlawful baby. If they couldn’t get
rid of the miserable sinner by chasing her to the far-off
metropolis, they would probably murder her and burn
the body, to preserve a “ decent "’ family’ from “ shame.”

Concord (N.S.W.) railway station is a
couple of miles from Concord, and as strangers
are always getting lost there, a change of name
lias long been suggested. Now the local council,
presumably inspired by the genius who evolved
“Brighton-le-Sands,” has approached the Railway
Department with a request to call the place
“Brunswick.” It would be easy to kill the
Brunswick suggestion in these Jingo days by
pointing out its German origin ; but there are
better reasons against it. Why should Aus-
tralia import its names from Germany or
any other country? Names are given for
purposes of distinction —otherwise everybody
would be called Smith, even if “Hey” were not
considered sufficient—and to take a name already
ip use lays the foundation of confusion at once.
There is a Brunswick in Westralia and another in
Victoria, and there is a post office called Bruns-
wick-street in Queensland. One of these days the
Commonwealth may have a Postmaster-General
with sufficient will-power to revise the whole
of the lunacy of Australian nomenclature. New
South Wales and Victoria duplicate, among 100
others, Windsor, Richmond, Elemington, St.
Kilda and Queenscliff, and Brighton is found in
four States. And the worst of it is that the
names appearing most frequently are stolen ones
which should not have been given at all.

Sydney “Central” Railway Station was
found wanting on Easter Thursday, when the
people going out of town for the holidays gathered
in unusual force. Only a limited number of trains
can run in and out of the white elephant, owing
to the peculiarities of its construction. Instead of
the railway running right through, and the big
station being merely the principal station on the
line, it is a terminus, or
block, or dead end. An en-
gine comes in dragging a
train. That engine finds
itself in the bottom of a sack.
Sometimes it loafs there use-
lessly till the train —dragged
by a new engine at the other
end—goes out again, in which
case there is a sorrowful
waste of engine power. Some-
times things are.worked this
way: The train comes in
dragged by Engine I. The
passengers get out. Engine
11. hitches on to the other
end of the train. Engine 11.
drags the train out, and goes
wandering with it over a great
waste of rails in order to
clear the way. Engine I.
then escapes, and also goes
wandering over a great waste
of rails, looking for a new
job. Then Engine 11. hacks
the train in again, and it fills
up with passengers, and is
dragged away on its journey,
and Engine I. turns up in
charge of some other train.
On busy days and nights it
doesn’t help things to have
Engine I. shut up in the
bottom of the sack till the
train starts again, nor does
it help to have Engine 11.
dragging the train all over
the shop and getting in the
road of traffic so that Engine
I. may escape out of its hole
and resume active service.
Sydney keeps growing, and
this bottom-of-the-sack ar-
rangement becomes steadily
more difficult. On the night
before Good Friday the floor
practically fell out of things,
and trains ran anyhow, and
people also ran anyhow, and
chaos supervened. In a
general way, the country trains pulled through,
but this was only managed by the sacrifice of sub-
urban trains, and Mr. and Mrs. Suburbs got
home at a late hour, riding on the roof, or they
hung on to the rear buffer and ran like Sheol
behind.

The real sufferers from the defective trans-
port and victualling in connection with the Vic.
Easter encampment have not received one word
of commiseration. They are the proprietors of
cheap eating houses in Melbourne. The belated
swaddies who “returned empty” from the field
of battle were ready to consume anything, and
they rushed every “ full-and-plenty ” where a
lion’s lunch could be bought for sixpence. At
first the proprietors of the hash dispensaries were
filled with a great gladness, but as the warriors in
possession went on eating, devouring, consuming,
and assimilating, only pausing to put up rude
clamor for more goods, a blanket-like gloom
settled down on Old “ All-Meals Gd.,” and he
began to tear his baldness and denounce his
patrons. But the ruthless destruction went on,
and in three instances the rude public in the
streets barracked gleefully while a harried hash
entrepreneur hastily threw up his shutters. Then
the front door was locked, and only opened to
permit of the ejectment of bloated soldiers, one
by one.
Christchurch (M.L.) is the haven of the
religious crank. Several lengths of him put
aboard the Nimrod a half dozen weighty cases
before that vessel sailed from Lyttelton for the
Antarctic. When the ship was knocking about
in the Polar zone the cases were tapped. Expec-
tancy suffused the countenances of the half-frozen
sailors. They looked for delicate edibles, but when
tracts galore were unearthed from among much
straw the collective jaw of the Pole-hunters fell
below zero.

The Oriental Timber Corporation (mostly
a Melbourne syndicate) whose half-finished mill
at Geelong was blown down on Easter Tuesday,
has had bad luck. It is only a few months
since a northerly gale swept thousands of logs
out of the Corp.’s temporary pond at the North
Shore and spread them promiscuously about Port
Phillip Bay. They were mostly recovered after
much risk to shipping and great expense. The
building that turned turtle when the wind struck
it —a two-storey affair. 200 ft. long by 60ft. wide—
was being built on a plan new to Australia. The
pillars, of 14in. by 14in. Oregon pine, are merely
stood upright, each on an elevated base of con-
crete, from which an iron spike or dowel projects
4in. into the pillar. Such an affair might be
stable once the roof, floors, and heavy machinery
was placed atop; but the wind didn’t wait, and
now two coffins and a quantity of splints will have
to come out of the ruins. This lightly-tied build-
ing idea looks suspiciously like a Yankee notion,
and the ruins also look very American.

“ Bloggs ” : In times of stress the empire
has never yet failed to unearth a poet to voice its
sentiments. One such has now arisen in Colonel
Sir John Bingham. Bart., V.D., J.P., etc. He is
a typical Bard of Empire. This, for instance, is
from a recently-published pamphlet of verse by
him :
As a couple of smashing arguments in favor of
Dreadnoughting in its most acute form, the above
strike me as pretty well unsurpassable.
Will Dyson, the artist, intends to show
a number of his drawings in Melbourne, before
departing for America, a few weeks hence. The
originals of the unique and forcible caricature
portraits by Dyson which have appeared in The
Bulletin and Lone Hand will he among the
array, and these, with a number of other
drawings (not caricatures), should make an attract-
ive collection. They will be hung at Furlong’s
rooms, in the Royal Arcade, Melbourne, a very
convenient pitch for a show of that kind.
“Janor”: May I enquire if there was a
rush of tourists during the Easter holidays to
Yassberra, the latest p oposed Federal capital
site, even as there was to Dalgety and Jindabyne
and their surroundings ? If so, what sort of a
time did they have ? , I’m prepared to swear they
didn't have the gorgeous experience we had on
the Snowy River. There were swarms and shoals
of us, and the place was absolutely crowded.
The Government took us down by special trains —
there were no special trains to Yassberra, because
nobody wanted to go there. But at Dalgety and
Jindabyne. by the Snowy, all hands and
the cook were vociferous in their delight re the
bracing climate, the varied and magnificent
scenery, and, above all, re the majestic, never-
failing river. We swam and paddled and fished
in it, and had an all-round ripping time. The
Snowy River’s environment gets a grip of you;
you leave with regret, and always with a vow to
return next vacation. That is why Wade’s
Government advertises this place as the paradise of
Australia, and urges the whole community to
come to Monaro and revel in its beauty and its
healthfulness. You might tear the N.S.W.
Tourist Department , into several thousand
pieces without discovering any announce-
ment to the effect that Percy Hunter
or any similar individual was getting up a
great series of excursions to Yassberra—in fact,
the N.S.W. Tourist Department couldn’t get one
blighted tourist to start for;Yassberra. Monaro,
when it is considered as a possible Federal capital
—as a place where there might arise a great Aus-
tralian metropolis that would in time overshadow
Sydney—is utterly accursed in the eyes of the
N.S.VV". State authorities ; but Monaro, regarded
as a bit of N.S.W., is a wonderland, a marvel of
beauty, and the boss health resort of Australia.
And Yassberra, regarded as a site for a Federal
capital where the Sydney daily papers would be
able to secure all the business that was going, is
simplv gorgeous; but Yassberra, regarded as a
place that anybody would care to go to for a holiday
and as a spot”that it would be worth while running
a holiday excursion train to —well, its name is
Slush. The N.S.W. Railway Department never
runs a holiday excursion to Yassberra. It knows
better.
THE PEACE SOCIETEE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In place of eternally urging Great Britain and her
colonies to form great military and naval armaments,
true wisdom would dictate the heed for cutting down
these establishments.—Daily paper.
The Bear was seized with penitence within his hollow
tree;
He thought of all the blood he’d shed ; “ Alack and Woe
is Me !
My Past is black —my Present, too, is blue as blue can
be—
I’ll drop my Sins and form myself a Peace Societee 1
“Noflesh shall pass my teeth again or fill my hungry maw ;
I’ll feed on roots arid radishes and live within the Law ;
I’ll clip my claws and draw my teeth and let the People see
The Wicked Bear that was-\s now a Peace Societee.”
The news went round the forest wide, and every car-
nivore
Who lived within a hundred miles upon old Bruin bore ;
And some they trotted singly in, and some by two and
two,
And some who wept for joy inquired, “O brother, is it
true ? ”
He oped his mouth and bared a jaw without a single fang,
And then he showed a clawless foot to all the greedy
gang ;
Their eyes grew wet with sympathy, their lips were run-
ning o’er; *
(They’d loved him dearly in the past; but now they liked
him more.)
They drew a-near their Brother, each with red and
lolling tongue ;
And as he laid his lesson down upon his lips they hung ;
They deeply drank his wisdom in—it warmed them, up as
wine,
And when the sun began to sink they all began to dine.
The3' banqueted in royal state about the set of sun ;
They vowed the dish a dainty one, though slightly under-
done ;
And then they wended gently home, as happy as could
be ;
And with them went—by several ways—the Peace
Societee 1
QUEENSLAND.
FURNESS BORN.
TO BIND THE EMPIRE.
The Lion’s Cubs far o’er the sounding sea,
Conquering Nature’s vast domain,
All echo messages of love to thee
Their Mother ; Then roar them back again
To bind the Empire.
With gleaming eyes, set teeth and courage grim
Young lions fronted in thy ranks of war,
Beshrew the man who casts such grace from him,
Despised of nations such weak patriots are,
To bind the Empire.
Here is a nasty one for pro-Boers : —•
You're not now in South Africa,
A-loving of the Boer, O,
Yet, little Englander, you are
A-barring of the door, O.
Those whom you term the “ pothouse press ”
Don’t mind your little roar, O,
They’re sure to know what Britain wants,
You’ll fail to bar the door, O.

“Fx&R” Watch
Unrivalled.
We received the following- last week about one of our
“Fx& R” Watches:—“l bought a watch from you
about nine years ago. It might interest you to know the
result. It went the whole nine years without stopping.
The hands were set right once a year only. It was never
five minutes’ wrong in the whole time. It lost just two
minutes during the last 12 months. With these facts
comments would be superfluous.”
These watches are specially made to meet Australian
wear.
They are jewelled throughout (15 jewels).
They are f-plate Levers.
They have expansion balances.
We unhesitatingly say they are the strongest and most
profoundly accurate Watch the world produces at a
low-price.

CYRIL : “ I just heard as poor ole Weary's dead."
EUSTACE: "'E didn't seem that badly ’urt.”
CYRIL: "No, but when they wus carry in' 'im in

“ Cict ”: As to “ Kola’s ” eels (B. l/4/’O9).
Notwithstanding his learned narration, I have
much defiance in contending that I have seen an
eelster 3m. in extension over 50 miles from the
ocean or other brine ; and it was in a brook on
the wrong side of a waterfall that was anywhere
up to 90ft. high. Possibly the fish back-pedalled
up the cliff, but I won’t believe it, and am open
to take up “ Kola s ” bet of £5, and to maintain
that there was an eeless around with one egg at
least aboard even, perhaps, admitting that an
aspersion may be cast on the youngster’s parent-
age. “ Kola ” further remarks that eels confined
in dams, etc., that have ho outlet, do not breed.
How can “Kola” prove that, prior to love-
making, the fair eeless first assures herself that
she has a clear run for the sea ? By the time she
could get back again her lord and master might
have eloped with another cat, and she be left to
further swell the ranks of deserted wives. No,
“ Kola,” I’m sorry, but I saw that young eel
myself, and I didn’t see it either by deputy or in
a book.

“ S.S.S.” (from the Far North) : A party
of Australians, with Port Moresby niggers as
bearers, passed through a Papuan village. Its
wizard was eating ginger root. (The pouri-pouri
operator primes himself up for days on certain
roots, and then breathes on his victim.) One of
the bearers was a mission-bred nigger, and had
lived for years amongst whites. He spurned the
wizard with his foot and poked brown borak at
him. The colored heathen clergyman remained
mute, and munched of his root much mouthful.
Three months later the wanderers happened
across him again, and the bearer mocked more.
In fact, he mocked copious. Then suddenly a
dried wisp of wizard uprose and breathed hard on
the boraker’s neck, and that mission nigger
became as one dead. At this point Australia took
Papua by the hair, and spoke to the effect that, if
its mission nigger died, a certain wizard would
whiz into eternity, and his village would be smoke
and ashes. Papua said it was only a little joke, and
recalled the mission nigger by incantation. The
process took two hours, and the patient came back
to this world with a silly sort of look that never
again left him. He said he felt nothing, but that
he saw himself lying on the ground, and could tell
what was said by the people who stood around.
In fact, he had put in a spell as a disembodied
spirit, and the experience was too much for his
limited brown intellect.

“ Silas Snell ” : Every Australian bush
township I have known has had its ghost. As a
rule there was not much faith in the supernatural
character of the visitant, and the most successful
spook of the lot, regarded as a phantom, stole
hens. One ghost was an interesting banshee. It
sprang into existence, or at least it materialised,
at a very dull time, and was in active operation
for several months without its raison d'etre
coming to light. This spook was a tall, attenu-
ated phantom, with a solitary red eye, and was
rather more daring than the average
Outback banshee. It would appear sud-
denly from nowhere, run at amazing
speed along the hill at the back of the
township, uttering a long, low, mourn-
ful wail, and then fade into obscurity.
It was often seen and often hunted,
man-traps were set for it, springers were
devised to trip it up, and citizens lurked
with guns to blow out its light. Yet it
continued to haunt the place with ex-
traordinary vivacity, and two-thirds of
the inhabitants held it in dread. Burke
was the most strenuous hunter before
. the Lord. It was he who set the man-
traps, and who hit upon the idea of
pursuing the phantom with dogs. The
ghost .at last disappeared of its own
accord. A week or two before Burke’s
marriage it threw up the run, and
never materialised again. Probably the
mystery would have remained to the pre-
sent day had not a new party started
work in the old Cumberland tunnel, and
discovered hidden there a worn table-
cloth and a red lantern on a stick, along
with a trifle of dress recognised as the
property of Burke. Then it was remem-
bered that Burke was the champion
sprinter of the district, and a stern depu-
tation of townsmen looked him up, in-
viting an explanation. He was quite
honest. He confessed that he had acted
the ghost. He did it to win over Kitty
Gorman, he said. Kitty would not be
bothered with the men, and would not
look his way. She disdained his escort,
and turned him down on all occasions.
So he scared the life half out of her as a
ghost, and then offered his company
and protection as a suitor, and, as Kitty
was timid and superstitious, he suc-
ceeded. “But I wouldn’t do it again,” said
Burke, sadly (he had been married a year, and he
had a black eye). “ Maybe I’d better have given
up the ghost before I took it on.”

“Jailor”: “Cict” (B. 25/3/’O9) shows
himself to be, as Sydney Evening News would
put it, the veriest tyro in ophidian lore by flying
off the handle over the discovery of a verminous
reptile. As a matter of fact, quite 50 per cent, of
these footless brethren are infested with tick, the
linoleum or carpet kind being the most favored
hosts. It was surely to circumvent the vermin
that the first snake insisted on an annual change
of clobber. Nothing annoys a parasite more than
being turned adrift on an empty skin —which
means for him an empty stomach.

“ Mallacoota” : One of the most popular
amusements along the Vic. coast is catching tailer
or skipjack with a piece of white rag on a hook
trailed astern of a boat. The fish bite more
readily at a white rag than they will at spinaers.
This fish invariably has a parasite of the sea-louse
species in its mouth. A similar parasite attaches
itself to the tail of the mullet. I overlooked a big
haul of mullet recently, and nearly every fish
seemed to carry a closely-fastened appendage,
which in most cases seemed to have eaten well
into the flesh, and was detached with difficulty.
Some coast fishermen firmly believe that the pre-
sence of this parasite causes the frequent jumping
of the mullet, but the assertion requires proof.
Only the mullet itself can tell why it jumps, and
no one, so far as I am aware, knows the mullet
language.
APPLIED MEGHANIGS.
BLOBBS : “ Why, what are you doing with all those

DOBBS (who has a leaning towards the scientific): “ Don’ yer slice? Applied prinshiple of

bodish in upright poshiun.” (Falls heavily.)
“ Gwy ” : The early days were less rabidly
Sabbatarian than ours, in some respects, at any
rate. Delving into some old records, the other
day, I read that the first cattle-show held in Aus-
tralia took place at Parramatta on Sunday, July
13, 1806. Governor King, Major Johnstone and
Rev. Samuel Marsden were present, and the trio
were the largest exhibitors. Fancy the 1909
Methodist Conference patronising, say, the Easter
Show on a Sunday. So keen a cattle-raiser was
old Marsden that in 1808 he made a voyage to
England, a tedious job in those days, expressly to
get a better market for his wool and to import
Suffolk and Norfolk cattle.

“Sr”: It ill-becomes aboriginal liars
to persist in cross-lying one another over the
question whether the goburra does or does not
tear into carrion. Five writers have called six
other scribes liars over this deceased-meat
question, and vice versa. Why not settle the
matter by experiment? I own a smiling jackass
—a virile old bird—-that I am prepared to lease to
The Bulletin for 7s. Cd. a week, paid in
advance. The disputants
are to pay the freight on
the bird to and from
the office, to supply
every convenience
possible, to provide
Jack’s tucker, and
to insure the bird
for £33 6s. Bd.
against sudden
death. The Bulle-
tin office is also to
provide the neces-
sary dead meat, and
to furnish a reliable
scientist to watch
what the bird does
with it. The scien-
tist’s salary is to
be paid by The
Bulletin. If the
bird starves to death
from not eating dead
meat, or dies from eating
too much dead meat, I am to
get the insurance money within a month from the
date of decease. If the bird lives, and the experi-
ment is successful either in proving that he eats
or doesn’t eat carrion, I am to get an honorarium
of £26 13s. 4d. for my services in the sacred cause
of science. The bird is to be buried at The
Bulletin’s expense if he dies. Should the fowl
assume a non-committal attitude and decline to
prove anything, my fee (in addition to the 7s. 6d. a

“Vigilans” : To see the mixed races of
Europe settled on the land, go to Bauple, Tiaro
and other districts surrounding Maryborough.
In Tiaro you have Poles, Germans, Swedes,
Danes and Italians. They live hard, and look
hard. The females work as hard as the males.
In one field you will see a muscular Amazon fol-
lowing a plough or harrow bare-footed ; in another
“ the girls ” are out scarifying, or clearing timber.
But settling on the land must be an unprofitable
occupation in these parts, or poor use has been
made of the land hitherto ; because there are six
couples in Tiaro alone who draw the old-age
pension, after living there for 20 or 30 years.
Every cocky has a cry. “Last year the frost
ruined me cane !” said one. “Just making a new
start after the droot,” said another, “and the red-
water killed 10 of me best milkers!” And in a
good season produce has no market. Until you
have manufactures, and more people in the towns,
coekying here won’t make any Jimmy Tysons.
The Queenslander does not take to it, anyway ;
you rarely see natives farming in this district.

THE LUNATICS AND THIS LAWN-MOWER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My next-door neighbor’s very mad,
He’s out of bed at peep of dawn,
And in half-mast pyjamas clad
Proceeds to mow his blighted lawn.
My next-door neighbor’s, raving mad,
And I am just as mad'as he,
For from my roof I watch him pad
Backward and forward ceaselessly".
He wages war upon the shoots
Tiiat struggle upward, from the land.
I urge him on with frenzied hoots,
My chin within my hollowed hand.
He is the Barber of the Soil,
He cuts the Earth’s green hair each morn ;
I watch him at his useless toil,
And cheer when be has got it shorn.
But, when the brown skull’s showing through,
Down comes the hair-restoring rain,
Spilt by the cheerful angel crew,
And makes the Earth’s hair grow again.
Or, if by chance the rain comes not,
When he has cut it to the roots,
He wets it with the water-pot
And urges up the trustful shoots,
He scorns my maniacal yells,
My dances on the roof’s red tiles ;
And, while the uproar sinks and swells,
He drags the mower miles and miles.
I have to w'atch him mow his grass,
Although I try to hold aloof ;
The instant that I hear It pass
I have to climb upon the roof.
I used to curse him from my bed ;
When I was sane I would not stir ;
But now’ I think if I w'ere dead
I’d hear that mower’s hateful whir.
Its rattling knives mince up the daw'n,
And clip the seconds into chaff ;
He thinks, the fool, he’s cutting lawn !
He’s cutting Time ! That's why I laugh !
The chopped-up morning hours all lie,
And w’ither in a cool, green heap ;
High on the roof I watch them die,
• The murdered hours of rest and sleep.
My next-door neighbor’s very mad,
For w’hile I dance upon the tiles,
In elderly pyjamas clad,
He drags a Noise for miles and miles.

I have used Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera

ence,” says Mr. F. Schmaka, Paddington, W.A.
“ I have never known it to fail in an attack of
colic, cramps or diarrhoea, so always recommend it
to my friends and customers. To my mind no
mother should be without a bottle of Chamber-
lain’s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy in
the house.’’*
It is seldom that any beverage is welcome

“Fraulein”: Ever see a Glenelg River
(salt water section) resident fishing? The spectacle
has points of unusualness. The fish-pursuer
chooses a dark night, ties a lantern in the bow of
a boat, arms himself with a three-pronged rake,
and therewith garners in the fish as they jump.
Splendid mullet, weighing seven and eight
pounds, may be landed by an expert raker. I
have seen as many as 40 of these fish scraped off
the face of the waters in a couple of hours.
SOMETHING ON ACCOUNT.
“ Could y’ gimme a trifle t’ords a bottle o’ beer,
Guv’nor ? I got a cork!”
“Fraulein”: It is time, it seems to me,
for Abo.-writers to stop giving Cow the credit of
all the child slavery. Here (Strathdownie, Yic.)
Cow does not obtain to any great extent. But
Rabbit does. And for sheer slavery commend me
to the rabbit-trapping game. I know one family
of boys and girls who get up at daybreak every
morning, go round 40 traps each, take out and
skin their catch, rerset the traps, and then speed
home to breakfast. Afterwards they walk five
miles to school. In the evening they do the
same five miles back again, take out the day’s
catch, shift traps, and then hurry back to do their
“ home lessons.” I have never known them to be
late for school in the morning either. Of course,
they are stupid—horribly, incredibly stupid.

“S.S.S.”: On the Torres Strait Islands
sorcery holds the native in a very big grip. At a
big'Kai-Kai (feast) no man will leave any portion
of food, but carries every scrap carefully
away. The person with a grievance is ever
on the alert to get something which has
been in contact with his enemy. When he
finds it—a shred of clothing, a banana skin, qr,
maybe, a particle of mollusc—he pounces upon it,
wraps it in a leaf, and pays a sorcerer to incant.
The article is then given to the pigs or burnt. A
report is sent by word of mouth ; and so keen is
the victim’s sense of the mystic power of pouri-
pouri that he lies down and dies. Last month a
girl of IC> died of a pouri-pouri sorcered by some
Papuans 200 miles away.
“ Janor ”: The cheques were blewed. Tick
was dead. The track was imminent, and the
track without a bottle was Sheol. Bush Bungs
there be who invariably hand out a square-face
when the unchequed bushtnan departs, but this
particular Bung was not built on those lines, and
the two dead-broke toilers knew it. So, when
their last bob had been passed over the counter,
Bill and Jim shifted their blueys down to the
river bank, and dozed and cursed in the shade till
evening fell. The licensed bush chemist was
thinking of lighting up when Bill breasted the
cedar. His right hand fumbled in his pocket.
His left grasped the end of a rope that passed
tautly through the bar-door into the twilight
beyond, and he said, “ Girnee bottle er gin, boss ! ”
The rope jerked with a twang, pulling Bill half-
way across the bar. “ Woa ! woa mare ! Blarst
yer, stand up ! ” coaxed William, and the rope
slackened. Bung placed the fire-water on the
counter and eyed his customer making
frantic efforts to get his hand out of
his trouser pocket. Then the mare became
restless, and the strain on the rope was so
great that Bill was pulled suddenly into the night
—but not before he had secured the bottle. Bung
rushed round to investigate. The long, straggling
street was deserted. Man, beast and bottle had
vanished. He tripped over a rope lying on the
footpath, and picked it up. He identified it. It
was his clothes line. “ Well, I’m blowed !” he
snorted. And two primitive, thirsty souls squat-
ting on the river bank were “ ’aving one to make
’em sleep.”
A STRAIGHT TIP.
OLD MURRAY FISHERMAN : “ The biggest fish I ever caught I got about three miles past the big
gum; but though I was a-hauling up beautiful big fish as fast as I could bait, I had to
leave ’em, for I hadn’t a drink for two days, and was a-dyin' of thirst.”
NEW-CHUM: “I didn’t know this river was salt water."
O.M.F.: “No more it ain’t!”
N.C.: “ Then why should you go thirsty when there was plenty of water?”
O.M.F.: “ Water, young man ? What’s water got to do with a man’s thirst? You don’t
drink water, do you?”
COLLAR AND YOKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ’Tvvas bullicks made the country ”
The man from Jindabayne,
Red-whiskered, lean and hairy,
Asserted once again.
The chap from Rocky River,
Squint-eyed and squat and strong—
With one eye on the rafters
And one upon the throng—
Declared, with frantic gestures,
His reasons to enforce,
“ It wasn’t blanky bullicks,
It tvas the blanky ’orse 1 ”
The day was hot and dusty ;
The roads were tough and dry ;
A brassy sun sank blazing
Adown a copper sky.
They’d met, with friendly greeting,
That noontime at the Bend,
But now the Day unheeded
Was burning to an end.
Unfed, unyoked, unharnessed,
Fly-pestered, stood aside
Their teams ; with sundry horses
To posts and fence-rails tied.
While yet, within the shanty,
Those heated teamsters woke
Loud echoes o’er the merits
Of collar or of yoke.
The argument—first peaceful—
Grew to a yell in course
Confused, of “ bullicks, bullicks 1 ”
And “ ’orse, I my the ’Ousnj! ”
’Till —as of old, knights errant
Upon the highway met —
Would hurl the gage of combat,
And down to business get.
To prove the charms Of Isolde
’Gainst those of Guinevere —
Those drivers, just at sunset,
Abandoned each his beer,
And on the dusty roadway—
. By partisans about
Ringed fairly, and encouraged—
Began to fight it out.
The chap from Rocky River,
A Burns in sooth was he
In all but skill and training
And build and “ hittery.”
A Johnson, saving color,
Strength, stamina and brain
And scientific schooling—
The man from Jindabayne.
The betting on the issue
Was even ; for, of course,
One crowd was laying bullocks,
The other backing horse.
Oh, ’twas a famous battle.!
Still in their camps at night
They tell, along the ranges,
The story of that fight.
So even were they pitted,
And so unblessed of skill,
They struck, and missed and stumbled
Through forty rounds, until
Both warriors, exhausted,
Prone, pow’rless, battered, hoarse,
Could only glare defiance,
And whisper “ Bulliclt ! ” “ ’Orse ! ”
The shantvkeeper, acting
As arbiter of law
Precise and pugilistic,
Declared the fight a draw.
But when, with inward knowledge,
Born of the life he’d led,
He saw from indications
The row about to spread,
He cried “ This ’ere decision
Is fair an’ just an’ right:
You’ve ’eard the blanky barney ;
You’ve seen the blanky fight;
“Now some’s fer Rocky River,
An’ some’s fer Jindabayne,
There’s some fer ’oofs an’ ’orns ’ere,
There’s some fer ’oofs an’ mane ;
“ Since ever I remember
This argiment between
The bullockies an’.teamsters
On all the roads ’as been.
“ Now I am ’ere to settle
Disputes as referee ;
This blanky fight ’as ended,
A draw, as you can see.”
A light of inspiration
Flashed o’er his features coarse—
“ Which shows they makes the country,
The bulliclt and the ’orse ! ”
Now here was good, sound logic
And judgment based on lav —
They called off all the wagers,
Declared the fight a draw.
And, o’er replenished glasses,
The wreck from Jindabayne
The ruin from the River
Shook hands, in peace, again.

John M. Giles: You send in 11 verses, headed
“Dreadnought,” and the burden thereof is “We are
Englishmen and free." In a general way the definition of
a free country is a country where the people have the
right to govern themselves. Well, when the Statesman’s
Year Book (1908) was published—in the U.S. the general
rule was that every male citizen over 21 could vote ; in
Chili every male over 21 could vote provided he was able
to read and write ; in Belgium every male citizen over 25
could vote provided he had been a year in the country ;
in Austria every male citizen over 21 could vote
provided he was qualified by a year’s residence
in France every male over 21 had a vote pro-
vided he could show six months’ residence, and wasn t
on actual military service ; in Mexico, every male aged
over 25 had a vote. In fact, if you had studied the con-
ditions of a vast number of countries, and compared them
with the British Isles, where the voting power, except as
regards university graduates, was based on property or
money in one form or another, you would have altered
your refrain. England is the country where women
who are too anxious to get votes are sent to gaol.
And it might stagger you to know that about
five-sixths of the people of the British Empire
have not even a pretence of self-governing powers
Berkeley: Third time that wretched, dreary, common-
place story has reached this office. If it comes here
again it will be given to the Dreadnought Fund...
K.O. : Why worry about the McFie and the silly yarn he
told to the Melbourne Geographical Society about what
he calls “the White Australian Fanaticism.” The idea
of the McFie kind of person is that though white men can
live equally in Archangel (average temperature, 33) and
in Brisbane (average temperature, 70), because these
places are both outside that imaginary line which defines
the tropics, yet they can’t live at Fort Darwin (average
temperature, 82), because it is inside the imaginary
line. The 37 degrees difference don’t matter so
long as you keep outside the imaginary line,
but the 12 degrees are fatal, because you get
inside the imaginary line. He apparently doesn’t know
(1) that white men have lived and flourished in the tropics
for about 400 years ; (2) that a very large number of the
colored (even the black) races came from cold countries ;
(3) that almost all the colored people now in the Northern
Territory come from cool climates outside the tropics.
Probably McFie is one of the crowd which declared
Dalgety as a Federal capital practically uninhabitable for
white men because the temperature is only about three
degrees hotter than London. When the Tory fool talks
about Dalgety he is suddenly seized with a dreadful idea
that the white man can’t live in cool climates
R.F.R.: It doesn’t matter whether you write the gag
under, over, or on the back of the drawing provided the
gag is good and the drawing is ditto A.L. : (1) Lines
entitled “Dear Old Dad the Digger” are hardly ever of
value. There is a sameness about this oldster’s habits
and sentiments that render him boresome. (2) There is

one who has it not Australis: Level-headed senti-
ments in uneven, bumpy metre Chink: Would feel
more sure about * that rabbit-exterminating yarn

publication ” in which it is supposed to ha,ve first
appeared....K. McM. : Pretty, but too slight....
E.8.E.: “ Old Meg ” has passed out... .Balgowlah : Well,
you’ve made a bad start. If you try again, be natural and
drop that hifalutin. (If the hifalutin is natural, don’t try
again.) J.H.M.: Received one prettily-versed request
to be allowed to “drift to seaward” with a lady who was
“ born of sea foam.” If you think the lady will be a com-
fort to you, and keep your socks darned, drift by all
means R.R.T.: Your poems read like telegrams
A. Holds worth : “ Desolation ” only failed in the last lap.
K.B.: “Day Dreams” is trivial —a mere momentary
doze as it were J.T.S.: Regret that your patriotic song
is not the sort that induces people to dive into
their pockets after money for ships. The only
cash it stands a chance of raising is that which
listeners would disburse to have it stopped
J.G. : Waipiro, grog; Wai, water 0.L.: It is all very
well to talk largely of “springing to her side” when
“our mother calls,” but in this paper’s view the idea of
springing to the lady’s side by borrowing money from her
is banal B.R. : Your poems lack vitality. They are
skilfully put together, but the ideas and form are always
old Counter Jumper : The infant who was christened
Elliot because its six months’ wedded parents had stayed

D.N.F. : Several million gallons of ink have been lavished
by various publications illustrating that joke since the day
it was first conceived about three quarters of an aeon ago—
Riemann : The jokes arrived, but the points didn’t. A
blunt joke is a dreadful thing .C.A. : Admirable
reasoning, execrable rhyming The Wasp: The post
office absolutely refused to carry all that “ poetry ” for
2d., and the 4d. it cost us ,was dead loss G.B.H. :
Lamentable. One verse :
O’er the rolling waves and the drifting spume,
Ride the chariot and dolphins of old Neptune.
’Tis a rare old rollicking, blustering night
To visit my mistress, sweet Amphitrite.
...F.W.M. : You versify correctly, but your muse suffers
from artificiality and the fatal habit of using phrases like
“ambient air,” “refulgent form,” “passion’s mad em-
brace,” etc L. A. : Idiotic jest with the drooping lower
jaw of the incurable... A.E.D. : “Warning” is (1) too
dull; (2) too illiterate. We know the couplet :
England will fight,
And England will be right.
It has no application here. More appropriate were the
lines:
Noo South will borrow,
And its unborn kids will sorrow.
W. Hutchison : The articles maybe published in book
form'. If so, the fact will be advertised in this paper—

Harry H. : Picture impossible, and we have doubts
about the joke. Almost all the sausage jokes are old.
Also the sausages themselves are often not quite so young
As they might be James K. : Picture of small boy offer-
ing pantaloons labelled “Dreadnought” to old lady-
rejected with derision... C.E.J. : Picture doesn’t bellow
aloud for publication, so to speak F.W. : Now what
cause have we ever given you to send us a dread-
ful sketch of a small boy with torn pants, the
whole joke being dependent on the fact that
the rent is at the back of the pants?.
P. Tucker: Rather a plain fact (like a photograph of a
table or a chair) than a burst of imaginative art L.L. :
Involved cartoon idea badly executed S.M. B. : The
pub water-trough that the drunk fell into has been given
the old-age pension.

Mr. William Richard Yeomans, who died

By this paper’s “Oldest Inhabitant” :
Frank Fitzpatrick, a Sydney native, who died recently,
aged 62 years, was the son of Michael Fitzpatrick, of Par-
ramatta, one-time Colonial Secretary of New South
Wales, in the Ministry of J. S. Farnell (1877-8). That
Ministry consisted of nine members, seven of whom—
Farnell, Fitzpatrick, Cohen, Leary, W. H. Suttor, J. F.
Burns and John Marks—were natives; “Honest’’John
Sutherland and “ Water Jug’’Foster were the other two.
Apropos, Michael Fitzpatrick was Under-Secretary for
Lands until 1869, when he retired and entered Parliament.
He started business as a land agent, his example being
followed b.v other politicians—John Bowie Wilson, Thomas
Garrett, Hanley Bennett, Jimmy Hoskins, and many
others. These individuals almost lived and boiled their
billies in the corridors of the Lands Office until “ regula-
tions ” shut them out.
Justice Simpson is the first N.S. W. native
who has achieved the distinction of being an
Acting-Governor in his own State. In another
State, however, a Sydney native held the position
of Acting-Governor on several occasions. Maurice
Charles O’Connell, son of the Commander of the
Forces in 1810 and after, was born in the old
barracks in George-street, Sydney, or close handy,
possibly in the Lieutenant-Governor’s house, which
stood near the present Wentworth Hotel. His
mother was the daughter of Governor Bligh.
Man rice O’Connell was Acting-Go vernor of Queens-
land in 18(18, 1871, 1874-5, and, lastly, in 1877.
“ Boswell ” : A faddist of the first water
is Chief Justice Stout, of M.L., now on a trip to
the place the titles come from. His hatred
of horse-racing amounts to a chronic disease.
When on circuit he generally delivers a
free lecture in the town hall of the place
wherein he is adjudicating on the personal
poisonousness of horsey men and the enormity of
their ways and works. Incidentally he usually
drags in the beer question by the froth, and
spanks it soundly. If an embezzler, forger, or
what not has the nous to put forward a plea that
he was victimised by racing men, and so was
driven to crime, Stout welcomes him as an ally in
the cause, and as likely as not gives him the
benefit of the Probation Act. And then he
settles back and reminds all and sundry that this
painful case amply bears out what he has been
saying all along about the first cousinship of
Tophet and the racecourse.
Archbishop Smith, of Sydney, finished
fighting the good fight (with the cabmen about
the fare), and died quietly on Sunday, at the age
of 73. He was the first of his line who took the
trouble to die in the country which paid him his
salary. Of his three predecessors, Broughton
passed out in England (he was called “ Bishop of
Australia,” and had a seat in the old Legislative
Council), Barker pegged out his heavenly claim
somewhere in Europe, and Barry still lives there.
A good man in his rather narrow groove was
Archbishop Smith, and his appointment, if it did
nothing else, at least gave the overworked second
letter of the alphabet a rest. Tho procession
of Broughton, Barker, and Burry had grown
wearisome, and if the fourth bishop had been
named Bloggs people would have felt that some
kind of a curse hung over the place. Li his later
years the Primate didn’t argue the point about
the cab-fare with the bitterness of his first days in
Sydney, and his popularity greatly increased.” It
is difficult to take any bishop quite seriously, but
the Rev. Smith certainly deserved to be taken
seriously. He took himself that way.

many years. She is not so very 01d—45 at most—but her
appearance for the past ten years has made everybody
look sceptically on Tub Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant, iii
her gay youth Lil was one of the most beauteous of the
southern demi-mondaines; to day she is more like the
third of Norman Lindsay’s Fearful Three than either of the
others. Of late, possibly because the ravages of Time
and Beer have robbed her of her charm, Lil has led a
comparatively virtuous life, and has relied largely on
sleight-of-hand to keep her going. Lil’s fairy fingers
were so dexterous that she might have earned a big
salary on the variety stage. The innocent male person who
gallantly paused to point out the Town Hall to Lil
would find, on reaching home, that the sum of £1 Bs. 4d.
and a quantity of private papers had mysteriously disap-
peared from his stomach pocket, while' the philanderer,
after three minutes' earnest converse with Lil, would be
bereft of everything that wasn’t fastened on. One night
a stranger from the country disagreed, outside the Arous
office, with one of the Rats’ Push regarding the correct
interpretation of the Interstate Commission Act, or some-
thing of the sort. The Rat carried the motion by swing-
ing one on to the stranger’s jaw, throwing him on the
kerb by the ankles, and decamping. Lil—who isn’t a bad
sort—lurched up to the stranger, and, forgetting all pro-
fessional principles in her humane impulses, assisted a
casual John to put him in a cab. The Argus roundsman,
who happened on the scene at this moment, accom-
panied the patient to the Melbourne Hospital, where a
search revealed 85 sovereigns in various pockets. Re-
turning, the roundsman broke the awful news to Lil.
The deposed queen of the under-world spun round on her
Paris heel like one possessed, raised a blood-curdling
screech, and sank to the pavement, where she wept salt
tears into the gutter and disturbed Editor Cunningham,
who was mapping out a right-thinking leader at the first-
floor window. It was the chance of a lifetime, and Lil
had thrown it away. But Lil had another and more re-
liable source of income than larceny, grand or petty. Lil
was the “ fizgig ” splendid. She was “ information re-
ceived,” and her emoluments of office from the police
probably exceeded her earnings in other directions.
Whenever a big crime took place in Melbourne the,
“ demons ’’ looked to Lil; and even if no conviction was
obtained, and the affair was left—as in the case of
the Bauer murder—a mystery to the public, Lil could
always give a pretty good idea of where the guilt lay.
When Lil was convicted a gloom like a pall hung over
Russell-street barracks,-and when its friends met it and
silently pressed its hand, it was unable to reply out of
sheer emotion. In the course of her career Lil probably
protected 100 times the property she stole, and the com-
munity which allows a Judge to award a “Kathleen
Mavourneen ” to its most valuable factor in the aetectiQn
of crime hasn’t sense enough to keep itself w n. Apart

Although he is pretty heavy nowadays,
President Stirling, of S. A. Legislative Council,
years ago represented Cambridge in the hurdle
race against Oxford, and was amateur hurdle-race
champion of England in 1870 and 1872. He was
then in the early twenties. He was supposed to
be studying law in England at the time, and was
actually admitted to the Bar in 1871. But he has
never had to earn a crust that
way.

Mr. Charles Wye Weekes, ex-police magis-
trate of Gundagai and Yuss (N.S.W.). who died
last week, aged 73 years, was a son of Elias Car-
penter Weekes, who was Colonial Treasurer in
the Cowper Ministry of 1857-59. Mr. E. C.
Weekes for many years carried on a large
ironmongery business in George-street, near
King-street, Sydney. In earlier life he was an
assistant in the ironmongery warehouse of Tom
Burdeldn, where also at one time Henry Parkes
acted as handy man and storeman in general.
S.A.’s new Agent-General Kirkpatrick is
j ust past 61 years of age; but he was born in London,
and lived there for 13 years as a boy, so lie
may be able to stand the climate all right. His
mother accompanied Florence Nightingale to the
Crimea to nurse the British soldiers there. Kirk
landed in S.A. in 1861, and has lived there ever
since. He is generally looked upon as “a wily old
bird,” despite the benevolent aspect imparted by
his grey hair and beard. He first entered politics
as . a Labor member so long ago as 1891, after
several defeats.
As has been mentioned before, John
Leahy, late Speaker of the Queensland Assembly,
had an acid bite. Once he happened among a
number of his electors, boys from the bush, who had
come down to town from Thargomindah for the
show. John escorted them to the, nearest bar;
and, after he had invited them to name their
drink, one of the guests
said he’d just have a
“mouthful of beer.”
“You’ll have nothing of
the kind,” replied John ;
“ I’m only going to pay
fora pint.”
THE FOREIGNER.
Mr. Marshall referred to the necessity for prompt and
concerted action. It was his proudest boast to say,
imitating the words used by citizens. of the Roman
Empire, “Civis Britannicus sum.” He urged upon
the Government the advisability of avoiding vexatious
delay, bearing in mind the adage, “Bis dat qui cito dat.”
—ARGUS.
VOICE FROM THE AUDIENCE: “Yah! You
blanky Dago! Why can't you tork Inglish!”
Archbishop Redwood, of Maoriland—who
used to be called Archbishop Firewood—entered
his 71st year this month, and on March 17 he
completed the 35th year of his episcopate. His
father, a Staffordshire man, emigrated to Maori-
land in 1842, and settled on the Waimea Plains.
In those days the only furniture of the plains was
a cold gale of wind and a sheep or two. Arch.
Redwood is still remembered in Sydney for a
certain famous sermon. When he wrote it out
and had clean copies made of it for the press, it
contained a blasting statement about the alleged
valuelessness of Protestant marriages. Later, the
prelate thought better of it, and this withering
remark was never spoken, but he forgot to cut the
blighting observation out of the copies supplied to
the press, and there was such a row that the pillar
of the Church started back to Wellington with the
tail of his robe on fire.
Melbourne’s Anglican Archbishop is keep-
ing up the record of his predecessors in the matter
of press controversies. At present he is engaged
in a wild, whirling discussion with one “Cleon”
on the burning questions of Hell and Sin. Old
Melbournians will remember the famous con-
troversy between Marcus Clarke and Bishop
Moorhouse, which raged for months, and nearly
cost Clarke his position at the Public Library.
Another great controversialist was Archbishop
Goe, whose debates with his R.C. rival were
interminable. “ Fighting Larry” Rentoul usually
enlivened proceedings by butting in between the
Bishops and hitting out impartially on both sides.
Some ribald spectator referred to the controversy
as “a perpetual Goe-Carr.”
Sam Mauger, M.P., of Victoria, is a man
of many anti’s—anti-sweating, anti-beer, anti-
tobacco, and anti most of the good things of Jife.
His redeeming features are that he is a good Aus-
tralian and a staunch Protectionist. Sana’s one
practical hobby is fire-brigade work. He joined
his first brigade—the Newtown and Chilwell —
when he was 15, and was only a year or two older
when he founded a brigade of his own at Fitzroy.
It was called the Temper-
ance Fire Brigade, because
the members were sworn to
subdue the raging flames
with water, whereas other
dissolute brigades were
suspected of using beer.
Sam travelled all over
Victoria, organising bri-
gades in the country
towns, and took the
leading part in found-
ing the Fire Brigades’
Association. It was
the proudest day of
his life when the Asso-
ciation elected him pre-
sident. Sam’s political
opportunity came when
the death of John Han-
cock left a vacancy in
Footscray. After repre-
senting that salubrious
district for some years
he heard the call to a
higher sphere, and en-
tered the blouse of Reps,
as a Deakinite. Sam is
an amiable man of many
virtues and only one vice
—which is lay preaching.
Wallis, the new Chief
Secretary, is another illus-
tration of liow the S. Aus-
tralian Laborites run to
Cold Tea. Like Price, he
has been teetotal all his life. When the Laborite
first appeared in politics the Fatman’s cartoonist
used to picture him with a pipe in his mouth, a
bottle in his pocket, and the figure 8 in his legs.
But the bottle and the figure 8 have had to be
sadly abandoned.
Lovely woman is climbing into municipal
billets now. Mrs. R. H. Murphy has become
the fair shire-treasurer of Wodonga (Vic.), and
also assists her papa in his duties as shire-
secretary. Mrs. Murphy is the second lady in the
State to occupy a municipal position. The first
was Miss G. E. McNeill, who is the present
acting town clerk of Ararat (Vic.), where the
lunatic asylum is—and ought to be.
The lately-deceased Mrs. David Ham, of
Melbourne, was the mother of a large family.
Her husband, old David Ham, who represented
Wellington province in the Victorian House of
Rich Landlords, predeceased her; but she left a
legacy of six sons and three daughters to keep
Ham abundant. The sons are Major D. J. Ham ;
Dr. Burnett Ham, Health Commissioner of
Queensland ; W. T. Ham, who is also doing some-
thing or other in Queensland ; F. A. Ham, a
solicitor in Ballarat (Vic.); Dr. Hedley Ham, a
respectable Collins-street medico ; and W. S.
Ham, who is on the Melbourne Stock Exchange.
Of the daughters, one is Miss Marie Ham ;
another is the wife of J. Kingsbury, Crown Prose-
cutor of Queensland ; while the third is the better
half of one of the Baillieu clan. In addition to
those, there are sundry little Hams or Hamlets,
grandchildren of the deceased lady and the Ham
who went before.

AN EASY WAY FOR HIS EXCELLENCY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When State Governor Carmichael, of Victoria, visited a
Gollins-street church, the other Sunday, a red carpet was
spread from the footpath up the steps of the sacred
edifice, for the convenience of his Excellency and suite.
When common people go to church
They tread on damp, unpleasant stones,
And sit upon a wooden perch
That pains their democratic bones ;
But when his Ex’lency the Gov.
Goes forth to where the faithful meet,
To hear of hope and peace and love,
They spread'a carpet for his feet,
And softly pad his cosy seat.
To Governors a bit depraved
The weary grind of being saved
Is always made a perfect treat.
I sometimes wonder if on high
They show this kindness and respect
For souls vice-regal that may try
To gather with the winged elect.
Alack ! perchance our loyalty
Is not preserved at all up there.
What time Sir Thomas passes he
May find the Heavenward gangway bare.
No humble Fatmen bent with care,
And he may turn in pride to tread
The other way, because they’ve spread
No carpet on the Golden Stair !
VICTORIA.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The little men in the State Treasuries are be-
(nruuDg’ to weep wretchedly because they scorned the
offer made by generous, reckless Bill Lyne some months
afro, yi imam put on his massive frock coat and his
radiant plug hat, and projected himself into the fiscal
controversy with the proposition that the States should
receive out of the Customs and Excise revenue ±6,000,000
a A? ar t 0 begin with, the amount rising gradually to
±B,/50,000. In other words, he proposed that the Com-
monwealth should cease to make any cash payment to the
States, but should take overall their existing debts, which
debts represent an annual interest bill of £8,750,000 or
more. The Commonwealth was to assume all responsibility
to the public creditor for this heap of liabilities, and to
pay the full interest (£8,750,000) thereon, but at first it
was to collect, if it had the luck to do so, £2,750,000 of
the interest from the States. Afterwards it \\ as to collect
less and less, till finally it collected nothing- at all, and the
matter would then resolve itself into an eternal subsidy
to the States of £8,750,000 per annum. The insensate
State treasurers cast this lavish proposal hack at Lyne’s
hell-topper— cast it back with scorn, and asked William
in effect, if his grandmother was a monkey, or some such
opprobrium. Then a year rolled on, and a new Treasurer
arose. In that year many things had happened. The
old age pension matter took shape. The urgency
of the defence problem asserted itself more and
more, and the defence problem is a many-headed affair :
it includes land defence, sea defence, the taking over
and settlement of the Northern Territory (that unguarded
hack-door that opens on to Asia), and the building of two
transcontinental railways. Likewise other things hap-
pened, including the slump in the tariff revenue and
sundry events of less importance.
So Lyne’s lavish offer to the States is now hull
down on the horizon, and the Fisher Government offers
instead a fixed, permanent annual subsidy of £5,0b0 000
If that is not accepted the next offer will probably be less,
and the last one (on 31st December, 1910, when the Brad-
don clause expires) may be nothing at all. The silly
truculent incapacity which caused the State Treasurers
to reject Lyne’s absurdly liberal offer has led to a lot
more than a mere redaction in the amount of the offer
Lyne s £8,750,000 a year would have been absolutely safe
for ever; Fisher's offer of £5,000,000, even if it
is accepted, rests on a much more shaky basis.
Lyne s proposal was that the Commonwealth should
P n y t u- e States nothing in cash, but should assume
all their responsibilities to the public creditor. The
matter being once fixed up, the State subsidy would be
secure for all time, for the Commonwealth, no matter
what financial snags it struck, would have to fight its
own battle with the public creditor ; it couldn’t compel
the States to take back their debts. But if the States
retain their debts, and are themselves responsible to the
public creditor, and depend on a promised cash subsidy
from the federal Treasury, the position is quite different.
There is always the chance that a day of trouble mav
come when the Federal Treasury is very empty, and
when, instead of the expected cash subs’idv, there will
arrive at the State Treasuries a polite letter of apology.
There is always a chance, too, that some future Australian
Parliament may insist on a revision of the subsidy agree-
ment, for it must be remembered that the business won’t be
the sort of bargain between the States and the Common-
wealth which can only be honorably varied or dissolved
by mutual consent. Legally, after the end of 1910 the
Commonwealth can retain all tariff revenue, and if it
gives the States an annu .1 cash payment of £5,000,000, or
any other sum, it is a mere act of grace, and the payment
can be stopped or reduced at any time. Lyne foresaw
this, and when he proposed to take over the State debts
he said in effect: “Take your subsidy in one stupendous
payment of £245,000,000. Then the matter can never be
’ *j ec * ucec b repudiated, or haggled about because it
will be dome, and the financial connection between the
State and the Commonwealth Treasuries will be ended
for ever.” But the State Treasurers couldn’t see the
point, and now the dead sure £8,750,000 a year which
they refused has dwindled to a precarious £5,000,000, and
is likely to dwindle more, and to lose none of its preca-
nousness as it loses bulk.

This office still appears to be moving slowly ; and if M.L.
at the instigation of Joe Ward, goes in heavily for the
Dreadnought business, and the vast I O U that is goino-
to uphold the empire is signed, things in general are
liable to move a lot slower. The Dominion public debt
hounded from £51,837,631 in 1902 to £63,524,961 in 1908.
At the good, oid £2,000,000 or so increase per year, the
financial clouds have been banking up heavily enough ;
hut if the battleship mania piles another £2,000,000 or
£4,000,000 on top of it in one fell swoop, then the inevit-
abie gloomy day of reckoning is three or four years nearer
instead of only one ; also, when Mother Carey’s financial
chickens rush home to roost, they may be expected to do
so with extra haste and confusion. The wages of fictitious
prosperity and sham patriotism is Debt.
On the basis of total income, th 9 expense rate
shows a slight increase over that for last year

Turning to find what new business has been secured, it
appears that things are not quite so good as they might
he. New premiums for 1908 certainly show an advance
on those of 1907, but the expenses have moved up some-
what more quickly; lapses also are too numerous.
Taking the cost of the renewal premiums as 7 per cent,
and the annuity business .as 3 per cent., the charges on
those branches of the business were £21,733, leaving
£46,670 as cost of the new business. The cost of the new
business, therefore, is at the rate of 206 6 per cent.—
which is a shade higher than the figures for 1907. A
cheerful item of the expenditure which may readily b“
forgiven is that of £11,078 for land and income tax;
although it helps considerably to swell the total of the
year’s expenses, it has to be remembered that the land-
tax has been one of the main factors in the prosperity of
Maoriland.
The amount of the Assurance Fund is now
£4,264,684. The Investment Fluctuation Reserve, at the
beginning of the year, stood at £63,809. Interest figures

The Investment Fluctuation Fund has benefited during
the year to the extent of £20,000 ; it now totals £83,633.
Ine fondness for the mortgage as an investment still con-
tinues ; the increase in this respect during the twelve
months amounts to £183,845, and, although it isn’t as
tall as the £216,784 for the 1906-7 period, it is a fairly
large addition to the already bulging parcel.

I igures can’t show all the benefit conferred by this office
on the M.L. insurer; as a brake on the Private Encer-
pu?e concern, it pays handsomely for itself, and the drop
in the revenue since the 1903-4-5 period maybetiken to
indicate that the P.E. concerns tailed on behind the

The Cartwright annuities, established by the
Canadian Government, some months ago, are calculated
to make the local Anti-Sosher sit back in his office chair
and gasp. The author of the interfering and diabolical
scheme, which aims at making comfortable and safe the
old age of thrifty Can idians, is Sir Richard Cartwright—
apparently a knighted Socialist ! The annuities vary
from a humble £lO per annum to the moderate comfort
of £l2O. They start from the age of 55 years. An annuity
equal to ss. per week can be secured bv an annual pre-
ln lUl mu f 10s ’ ch ‘ a £ e of 20 > or 17s.' from the age of
30. The annuities cannot be seized for debt, are non-
transferabie and non-forfeitable, and money once paid to
tile Government on account cannot be withdrawn. How-
ever, if a prospective annuitant fails to pay in full, he will
receive such proportion of the annuity as is represented
by what he has actually contributed, provided he has
paid in sufficient to purchase an annuity of £lO. If he
dies before 55, his payments are handed over to his family
with compound interest at 3 per cent. If his payments
are interrupted by sickness, loss of employment, laziness
or any other cause, he may resume them when the cash
and the thrifty feeling are once more existent. Payments
can be made weekh , monthly, yearly, or in lump sums.
A man of 40 may deposit on the counter in one heap suf-
ncient money to pay arrears of premiums between 20 and
40, and complete the contract as if he had entered at 20.
Employers may contract for employees, and fraternal and
benevolent societies for their members. Depositors in the
post- ffice savings banks of Canada at present receive
■ipevcent., but if they prefer to transfer the money to
the Government for the purchase of a deferred annuity,
they get compound interest at 4 percent. Annuities are
paid quarterly and there are no deductions, the expenses
of management being borne by the Government. The
Government is said to have already received a large num-
ber of applications, and the post offices are contributing
a considerable business. The Auti-Sosher may, on read-
ing the details, lean against the nearest benevolent
asylum or workhouse and declaim passionately that this
dry-nursing of the masses from the cradle to the grave is
destructive of those good oid British qualities that have
made England the greatest and most nervous Power of
modern times. But the beauty of making Bill provide
his own old-age pension, and smoothing the way to the
cashier s desk so that he can’t very well avoid a
self-reliant citizen, may dawn on him later.
English papers have been giving attention to
the results of the first year’s work of the Public Trustee
whose office was created by law in Great Britain in 1907.’
J. O. Stewart, wno fills the office, reports that during his
first year he accepted the administration of 325 estates
valued at £2,095,000 ; and, in addition, he was notified
that he had been appointed trustee in estates valued at
present at about £19,000,000. His duties in some respects
are wider than those of the Maoriland Public Trustee
because the British officer may intervene where con-
tenuous trustees are imperilling the interests of the
beneficiaries, and he is entitled (and in a few cases has
already exercised the right) to call on private trustees to
furnish proper accounts. This is a weak point in the
Maoriland system ; for, though the officer there may take
over a trust if the appointed trustees resign it, he has no
right to exercise supervision over their management—
which, in very many cases is execrable. Gentleman One
in Maoriland is even below the Australian average.

Coda writes about Layers-on: I have seen
no references in The Bulletin hitherto to that well-
known backblocks identity, the iayer-on. You
may find the layer-on on any worked-out allu-
vial field. The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant—that
garrulous old sinner who pokes around Sydney
mourning over lost pubs—would have been a bosh-
ter layer-on had he been an old digger. Having
reached the has-been field aforementioned, the layer-on
will at once approach you. Strangers are his legitimate
P re y- will without delay proceed to pilot you round,
and show you where “it uster be rich in the ’sixties.”
Be not alarmed if he gathers up an armful of stones. He
won t aim them at you. Rocks are indispensable pointers
to his yarns. It is his practice to stand on a mullock-heap
and throw stones round the landscape ; wherever a stone
lands someone g-ot an ounce or more to the dish.
He will then proceed to lay you on to “a nice bit er
solid groun’, if you are thinkin’ er startin’ about ’ere.”
I saw one of these old rock-throwers once laying a couple
of new-comers on to a good thing. He had them on a
heap of cradle hopperings, and was pelting the sur-
rounding country as usual. “ Jist over there,” heaving
a pebble, “ old Charley Reynolds got two ounces to the
tub. Left it—too wet fer ’im. Over there” (another
?= one) l .J* nkeeßead ¥° t an ounce t 0 the d 'sh. an’ I got
250 z. 12dwt. and 4 grahfe,meself off the bottom of a hole
list there (another boulder). “Jist like curran’s in a
cake they wuz. I know fer a positive fact that there is
a bit er solid groun’ jist under ’ere,” he said, stepping off
the hopperings on to the tailings. They promptly broke
and let him through up to the armpits in slum. But it
didn t worry him. Nothing disconcerts a habitual
layer-on. The layer-on is usually a spry old chap, with
grey side whiskers and clay-stained pants, and on wet
days he haunts the blacksmith’s shop and spins yarns
about the fifties. He is a type that should have stood on
the abong-inahty and bombarded the wild cat
column with his armful of rocks long ago, and I reckon
I am a public benefactor for bringing him to the notice
of Bulletin-i tes.

“E.R,” meets a man from a district which
dn!« n 11 wt v ’£ Self in the papers nowa-
days .-William N. Irayne, better known in many mining
camps as Carondotta,” is back in Adelaide from Kim-
berley goldfieids in the north of Westraiia. His idea is
that the white man can live well and work hard there and
in the Northern Territory, if only he can obtain a proper
of having to live on tinned goods;
and his idea has 20 years’ prospecting experience in the
northern parts of Australia to back it up. As to Kim-
berley, he says he believes it owns the best climate in the
world. There are only about 70 men in the district at
present, and, in the vicinity of Hall’s Creek, which is the
distributing centre, the population is 30 all told. Two
stores serve the diners, but prices are verv high.
A 21b. tin of jam costs 2s. 9d., a tin of condensed milk
2s. 3d. Sugar is sold at 9d. per lb. usually, but at Is.
when the supply is short ; and 501 b. bags of'flour realise
30s. each. Although the men make about £3 10s. per
week on an average, it costs them at least £2 10s. a week
for food and other necessaries. These high prices are
mainly due to the cost of carrying the goods 250 miles
from VVyndham or Cambridge Gulf ; it runs to £25 a ton
as an average. Camels had been tried, but three teams
had been exterminated by a poisonous bush, which they
could not be prevented from eating. Horses had there-
fore been put on ; but recently SO camels had been
brought in, along with some extra-watchful drivers.
I 1 rav ne believes there is plenty of country yet to be pros-
pected. The mountainous region is barren, but in the
plains, especially along the rivers, the land is exceedingly
fertile. “The north of Australia,” he says, “can carry
twenty millions of people, and they could all make a
comfortable living. The sooner that rich country is
populated the better, for it is dangerous to allow a
region like this to lie practically idle.’

Chillagoe railway revenue for the past 12
months to March 31st amounted to £104,805, which
shows a decline of £9535 as compared with the previous
year. The line is economically managed, but if the
revenue comes down there is a probability that the ex-
pense rate—which has been down to 32 per cent, of the
total revenue—will go up ;so that the actual profit from
the railway isn’t likely to increase for some time to come,
ihe returns on the Silverton (Broken Hill) and Chillagoe
lines are familiar examples of the rapid fluctuations’ of
mineral traffic. The Chillagoe section is wedged in be-
tween two railways that are practically under Govern-
merit control. This is certainly a strong position, and
UhUlagoe did well to secure a time bargain for the sale of
the Etheridge line on such favorable terms. The
Etheridge line will prove an excellent feeder for the Chil-
lagoe railway, and it places the shareholders and deben-
ture holders on a more secure footing than they occupied
a few years since, w’hen interest was allowed to accumu-
late.

For. March, Harden gold mine (N.S.W.) crushed
1085 tons of stone for £2870 ; 820 tons of sands yielded
£323, and 416 tons of slimes £245 ; in addition, 28’8 tons
of concentrates panned out at a trifle over £9OO, the lot
making a total of £4340 or thereabouts for the month.
Expenditure for the same period ran out at £3829, of
which £lBB5 represented working costs and £1250 divi-
dend. Also “ the revenue for the past six months has
been considerably in excess of what had become to be
considered the average from the tonnage treated, and
has been chiefly due to the high-grade reserves above
No. 3 level but now that high-grade ore has been de-
veloped at No. 4 ievel, it is expected that this increased
revenue will be maintained.” Prom which it will be seen
the management is taking an optimistic view of things.
* * * ■*
Mount ldavid continues to stope out payable
stone from surface workings in the open cut. These
people are also doing the best they can with a short lens
of stone at the 155 ft., 220 ft. and 300 ft. levels. Deeper
levels from the winze are also being drawn upon to a
limited extent, and prospecting work in the deepest level
is being pushed on to try and pick up another lens of pay-
able stone. Tile last monthly return was rather poor, 615
tons returning 188 oz. of gold. Also 469 tons of tailings
gave 590 z., and the Huntingdon mill 320 z. It is doubtful
if the return was worth £lOOO, for that depends on the
value of the gold obtained from the cyanide vats.
Sharebrokers in Sydney make a lot out of the
statement that American mining groups can lay down
refined copper at from £42 to £49 per ton. A profit of
£lO on copper isn’t much good to some of these over-
capitalised concerns. Mount Morgan, with its present
output, would not feel too happy with a profit of £lO on
blister copper. Mount Lyell is also in the same plig ht ; a
profit of £lO calculated on blister copper (including by-
products) would be only sufficient to give a sixpenny
dividend per half-} ear. It is because costs are so low,
and profits so high at Mount Lyell that it can pay divi-
dends on 1,200,000 shares. A profit that seems tolerably
high from a consumer’s point of view would seem hope-
less to Mt. Lyell; for, after all, a mine doesn’t list for
ever, and shareholders expect a return of capital out of
dividends.
* * * *
Tin mines are seldom in favor with the share
market. The common idea is, of course, that they don’t
pay, or are over-capitalised. It is quite evident that the
share-market value of Mount Bisehoff, or Briseis, and
numerous other tin shows, depends on higli prices and
profits. Mount Bisehoff doesn’t make all its profit out
of the mine, for it does a big customs smelting trade.
Still Bisehoff pays £3OOO a month with a production of
only 80 tons of black tin from the mine. The mine can
hardly be expected to produce more than 800 tons of
metallic tin in a year, so if shareholders get dividends
amounting to £36,000, they are certainly doing pretty
well. Briseis has been making even larger profits on its
output of black tin. In Australia, at any rate, the pro-
duction of a ton of tin is expected to give a much larger
profit than any other base metal of the ordinary commer-
cial kind. It is because of these big expectations that so
many tin mines come to grief, and the industry becomes
unpopular. Stannary Hills, with its big share issue and
its debenture debt, expects to satisfy ail hands with a
production of from 60 to 70 tons of black tin per month.
The crosscut at 1970 ft. shows the east lode or
mainstay of the Ivanhoe (Kalgoorlie) to be poor and
broken. Breaks, similar to those which occurred in the
three levels immediately above, are said to be responsible
for this, and color is lent to the theory by the fact of the
lode matter in the crosscut being similar to that where
the other breaks occur. The management is not scared
over the disappointing development, and have told the
London office that it expects to get into solid, payable
ore a short distance north and south of the crosscut.
The east lode is the longest, most persistent, and best on
the Kalgoorlie field. It traverses the whole length of the
Ivanhoe lease, and the shoot then extends for several
hundred feet north in the Boulder ground, and south for
a greater distance in the Golden Horseshoe. At 1820 ft.
it averaged 465. 3d. for a width of 44 feet in the crosscut ;
and, as values have been more than maintained in
driving, the prospect of the 1970 ft. level eventually
turning out well isn’t at all bad.

The Florence, at Menzies (W.A.), has gone into
liquidation, which, under the circumstances, is about all
it could do. Co. bobbed up in reconstructed form about
12 years ago, and since then it has gone through £30,000
and chalked up other debts. Creditors may get some-
thing in the end, but for the shareholders it is a cold look
out. At one time the mine appeared to have fair
prospects, but it went to pieces at depth. Its failure,
however, is not an isolated one ; there are plenty of other
English-owned shows in the district in the same dismal fix.
* • * *
Creditors in the North Coolgardie Gold Mines
Ltd. (W.A.) have been cheered up by a request from the
London liquidator to send in their claims. About five
years ago, this co., with several thousands in its pocket,
took over the old Wealth of Nations at Dunnsville, and,
after living well for some time, it bought a job lot of
plant and started crushing. The first clean-up, however,
gave it such a shock that it tumbled head over heels in
its eagerness to get wound up. Since then the sale of its
effects has realised a few pounds, but, after the expenses
of liquidation have been met, there aren’t likely to be
many crumbs in the £ left for distribution among
ordinary creditors.
Somewhere about £26,856 was dug out of the
Gwalia South (WA.) during the half -year ended January ;
but, coming- on top of ordinary expenditure, an outlay of
£5030 in new machinery, and £4264 in development made
a big hole in the receipts. Still the co. managed to dis-
tribute a 2s. dividend, and on March 31 had £4714 in
hand, besides a reserve of £1547 for averaging- returns.
In addition to the ore reserves noted in a previous par,
management reckon that 14,115 tons of slimes of
2dwt. value are stacked on the surface. They also figure
on getting 4870 z. of gold out of the accumulated concen-
trates, which now amount to about 176 tons.
* * * *
Golden Pole (W.A.) is still on its death bed.
Since August last the mine has been worked exclusively
by tribute parties ; and, as the revenue earned last half-
year paid all expenses and left a small profit, the tributers
are to be kept on and encouraged. Co. has just thrown
up its option on the Kohinoor South at Stake Well after
spending £7OOO to no purpose ; but it still has about
£4750 left, besides 11,000 tons of 3dwt. slimes, and a fair
collection of plant, buildings, machinery and stores,
which stand in the books at over £12,000. Ore reserves
are practically nil.
Telegraphed from Norseman that somebody or
other considers that the Princess Royal will eventually
be one of the mainstays of the Dundas goldfield. The
Bulletin doesn’t dispute this, nor would it disbelieve the
man in the street if he said a call was about to be
struck, or that somebody was putting a wild feline in a
bag preparatory to bringing it into town. It merely'
adds that, when the field has to depend on the Princess
Royal for support the supply of broken reeds will pro-
bably have given out.
* * * ♦
Kalgurli (W.A.), in addition to ordinary de-
velopment expenditure, is to have a few thousand pounds
spent on its unexplored parts. Drives are to be lengthened,
crosscuts extended, and bore holes put in ; and, seeing’
the possibilities ahead of the work, the extra expense
about to be incurred by the co. isn’t an item that can
reasonably be taken exception to.
* * . *
Hooper, Speak and Williams have just reported
on the North Kalgurli (W.A.), for someone in London.
At present the property' is swarming with tributers, and
an extra 10 head of stamps has just been obtained to
meet their requirements. Should, however, Hooper and
co. see anything worth bothering about, the co. may
come out of retirement and resume operations on its own
account. In that case, however, it is doubtful if it could
do better than it is doing at present.
Cumberland (W.A.) furnishes another mournful
example of the uncertainty of life at Norseman. For
some .years past the co. has managed to keep up a shabby
genteel appearance on gold won from one or two
capricious shoots ; but, like other concerns which lived
and died in the district, its source of living has gone to
pieces at depth. Last month’s operations showed a loss
of £7lO, and, as the mining outlook is critical, share-
holders may be summoned to gather round the co.’s
deathbed at any time.

On December 31 Hake View Consols reserves
were estimated at 174,159 short tons, worth about 275.
lid. per ton. The previous half-yearly' estimate was
179,537 tons, averaging about 28s. 3d. per ton.
Whim Well Copper Co. (W.A..) has wrung an
apology from the London Statist for all the things it said
about it in June last, and the libel action has been
settled “ on terms mutually satisfactory to both parties.”
In its withdrawal, the Statist vows that the statements
contained in the article were derived from a source which
it considered reliable, but which it now admits did not
properly represent the co.’s affairs.
Central and West Boulder (W.A.) cleaned up
3044 tons last month for £3715. Working expenses ab-
sorbed £2659, and development £l5O, so that a profit of
£906 remained. This co. gets its mining done by the
Oroya Brownhill, and has its ore treated on the latter’s
premises ; but, for some reason or another, it draws the
line at publishing anything about itself locally'. Anyone
who wants to keep in touch with its doings has to scan
the London papers ; and even then nothing beyond the
result of an occasional return, supplemented now and
then by an involved progress report, meets the eye. As
Australian shareholders stand this without a murmur,
the presumption is that they would stand anything.
* * * *
Murchison Associated (W.A.) has been passed
on to tributers. The co. still advertises heavily, but, as
The Bulletin has often emphasised, even the expenditure
of lots of money' and the free use of a Government
diamond drill has not helped the optimists. Having
farmed out the Westralian property, the co. is now
boosting a gold-dredging venture in ‘far-away Terra del
Fuego. This proposition is said to be “ full of promise,”
and the Board hopes to retrieve the fortunes of the co.
out of dredged dividends ; but it has hoped in its time for
such a lot of things which haven’t cotne to pass that its
reputation as a successful hoper is a little faded.
Wallaby Copper Mines, Ltd. (W.A.), means to
get floated somehow. The nominal capital is £20,000 in
400,000 Is. shares, and, in order to “ get the public in,” a
London firm of outside brokers lias generously offered, if
the whole issue is subscribed, to repurchase 260 shares by
public ballot—one share at £2OO, one at £lOO, four at £5O,
four at £25, 50 at £l, and 200 at ss. ; if a less number is
taken up, they will make a pro rata repurchase of shares.
In other words, the country clergyman, the middle-aged
spinster, and tire struggling widow and orphans to whom
such invitations are usually sent at “ ’Ome ” are asked to
take a shilling’s-worth or more in a venture about which
no one appears to know anything, on the offchance of
winning £2OO or less in a lottery, and the additional off-
chance of the co. being something more than a thing of
ink and paper.
* * * *
The Anniversary, Herberton (Queensland), has
been floated in 40,000 shares by the crowd that controls
Mount Molloy. The prospectors are taking paid-up
shares for their interest, and as is usually the case with
Queensland flotations there are more paid-up than con-
tributing shares. The Anniversary has given out good
reports, and some picked ore has been sentaway. Mount
Perry people were rather anxious to get hold of the mine,
but they failed to complete the deal. Mount Mollov has a
smelter rather favorably situated for wood and water, in
fact, this co. seems to depend a good deal on its timber
concession. Herberton will soon be connected by rail,
so copper ore from that district may help Mount Molloy if
the market takes another upward heave. None of the
mines in North Queensland have shown themselves capa-
ble of producing at a low cost. Singularly enough, the
0.K., which is 50 miles from a railway, has put up the best
record, and, although things look rather cold at present,
it must be remembered that the district round about
O.K. has big possibilities.
* * * *
Clark’s Brilliant (Charters Towers) at 1143 ft.
from the surface is sinking through favorable country.
If anything is struck the Victory just across the boundary
should have a chance. Victory shares were bought a
while back on the hope that the Day Dawn reef might
spread eastwards, but all these expectations are about
dead. The East Mexican, although it has driven a long
distance on the Day Dawn reef, did not think the
development worth sinking a shaft for. A crushing of 61
tons of stone taken from the rise from No. 6 returned
£303, so there must be a small shoot of stone to work in
Mexican ground. The eastern extension of Nos. 5, 6 and
7 on the Day Dawn do not compare well with the splendid
blocks of ground worked from these levels in the parent
mine. Driving east on No. 7 has been stopped, as the
level is out far enough to connect with the crosscut from
the N. B. Freehold shaft. Prospecting operations from
this shaft are particularly interesting just now because
crosscutting for the hanging wall reef is going ahead,
and still another crosscut from No. 3 is being driven on
contract to pick up the Brilliant. So the Freehold has a
lot of development on hand in search of three different
reefs.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating’ mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the liyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

The Flving Pis: reef, which yielded sensational
crushings in the early days of Thornborough (N.Q.), was
cut the other day in Brophy’s tunnel. T>ie owners of it
in the Middle Ages were J. J. Byers, Billy Little, Jnnmj
Rolls and one or two others. It is said that one crushing
yielded over 230 z. to the ton. The mine, however, was
neglected, and the shareholders quarrelled among them-
selves, and went to law. They spent, most of the r lying:
Pifc profits in Costs, and the little that was left went
largely in champagne. When the Walsh and Tmaroo
took the miners away from the Hodglnnson the Hying 1
Pie 1 was worked anyhow, and was finally abandoned.
Subsequently a miner named Murphy reckoned he would
make a fortune by driving* into the hill, but, although he
stuck to it for years and struck several leaders, he dropped
across nothing good. Finally, he gave it up. The mine
was then left alone for about 20 years, but about four
years ago one Brophy began where Murphy had knocked
off. He didn’t find anything valuable, nor did Grogan
and Grainer, who backed him, although the tunnel was
driven 600 ft. Recently Grainer let the mine on tribute
to two brothers named Volkmann, and after driving only
30ft. they struck the reef, which is said to be 20in. wide
and to go soz. to the ton. Byers, Little and Rolls are
still alive. Byers is Government Land Commissioner at
Roma ; Little, who represented Woothakata for a time in
Queensland Assembly, is in the Herberton district; and
Rolls is still on the Hodgkinson.

“Melilla” writes, and the postmark on his
letter indicates that it started from away up in the Gulf
region : “The Palmer (Queensland) is stilt to stagnate,
the Victorian people who recently pegged out some of the
old (and allegedly good) reefs having obtained a second
spell of six months (making a total of 12 months) exemp-
tion, according to the warden’s report. It appears that
their ideas were bigger than their purses, and they failed
to finance the scheme, and have locked the field up. The
Palmer has had bad luck of recent years. White ants,
stagnation and desolation are the notable features. Some
years ago a party of speculators in Sydney, and a young
but experienced mining engineer, were thinking of giving
it a new trial. At that time people were doing well as
a result of Gympie and Charters Towers specs, and
a few thousands could have been easily put up. The
engineer got all the reports available, and was just about
going north to see what was to be seen of these Palmer
reefs, when, like a clap of thunder, came the news that
an actor, one Kyrle Bellevv, had pegged pretty well all
the reefs. The scheme was dropped at once, and other
affairs took its place. Bellew kept the field locked up for
a while and did nothing but hurt himself, for his attempts
at flotation failed. The old Sydney party is broken up.
Some are dead and others have retired to grow roses in
the evening of their days, and the Palmer stagnates.
The area that is locked up in Queensland under the
excuse ‘ time to procure capital,’or under no excuse at
all —the lessees not bothering about exemption, but
simply paying tlie rent on leases (sometimes they don’t
pay the rOpt till some prospector makes a discovery on
the ground)—is astonishing, and the whole business is a
discredit to the Mines Department.”

Langi Logan, at Ararat (Vic.), has been floated
away from Peacock’s office. The spurt in Cathcart has
made the impossible pos-ible. Did not Bewick, Moreing
and Co. fail to find the cash wherewith to sink the Langi
shaft and face the drift? How the lease tumbled into
Harrj' Dodd’s lap is what mice and men don’t know, but
its possession enables him to make his second score off the
firm. First by pulling Cathcart out of the mire in which
it seemed to be fast stuck ; next by being able to flip
the Langi Logan, which they had had under option,
into marketable shape. Itiswhispered that this scoop will
bring’ him £5OOO cash and a good swag of paid-ups. Langi
Logan hasn’t a nice name, because two shafts faded away
before running drift as quickly as sand before the
breakers. Maldon financed those ventures, and got
potted so heavily that old W. B. Gray never did more for
Langi Logan than bang on to the lease to his death. It
is alleged that the new Langi Logan is to have £12,500
working capital. If £5OOO of that is to be cut out, there
will have to be a resort to fairly solid call-paying to get
the mine going.

Jumbunna Murray tells bis shareholders that
his Vio. coal co. had always striven to add to profits by
cheapening production—not by pulling wages down..
Such a noble sentiment stands as a great slab of
humanity in a cold world. But the words, don’t quite
harmonise with the Gippsland coal lord’s actions in fight-
ing unionism tooth and nail. On Murray’s own talk,
there is barely a living . wage -at Jumbunna.
Possibly 7s. 9d. a day for men and boys is a bitaboye gold
miners’ pay, but there are no potatoes about living in
Gippsland. If coal seams kept of decent size and good
work could be done, as at Maitland (N.S. W.), the wage-
sheet would be different. No one says that Jumbunna,
with its resources, can well average more than 7s. 9d.
But that is a mean average which humanity demands
shall be advanced once the co. is out of debt. What with
freight rebates and special price for coal, to say nothing of
the absence of serious competition from Newcastle, both
Jumbunna and Outtrini Howitt ought to 1 be restricted to
a minimum of Bs. When the State coal mine at Powlett
Basin gets going relations between the State and the old
Victorian coal mines will have to be re-cast. So it is up
to Murray to wipe Off his debenture debt with all pos-
sible speed and get ready for the new order of things.

New Normanby, Ballarat East, has h,ad half a
column of press cuddling because it has just distributed
a 52nd div. Figures do not show that New Normanby is
very much richer than the old potentate after whom it
was named. Of course, £31,800 in dividends for an outgo
of £410,000 tells of perseverance rather than profit.
Co. lias done . better of late because it has made
up its mind to try the ground at 700 ft. and 800 ft.
Although big- makes of quartz are met with at Ballarat
East, they carry small gold. contents. The most is not
made of the material to hand, or heavy stamps would
rush big tonnages through. But that is not the Victorian
way. Victoria prefers to make calls, pay a div. or two,
make calls, and so on.

Porcupine, Yarra Glen (Victoria) has shed its
quills very quickly, the last one going to pay for the
liquidator’s’ fees just as the first one was for the cost of an
exceedingly pretty prospectus. The ways of mines round
Melbourne are like those of the perky punter. They are
rich at first, and objects of interest to mankind, and so
poor are they at the last that no one searches for their
gravestones. Warrandyte and all the adjacent shows are
now a dream of Stock Exchange madness, and there, was
never any real reason to expect a different ending.
* * * *
H. Johnstone: According to the prospectus, it
is a splendid mine; the shaft is in good order: many
thousands of tons of fairly rich ore are opened out; the
ore is a free milling stone which is easy to crush ; and
dividends will sta‘t immediately and last for a devil of a
time. Yet the previous owners abandoned the show, and
left all these profits lying about loose. This writer would
like to inspect that mine very carefully before he rushed
headlong to invest all his wealth in shares.
The Standard Electric Elevator Co. and the
Wavgood Elevator 00. contemplate launching out as
Standard-Way good, Ltd., with a capital of £lOO 000 in
shares of £1 each. Of such shares 5000 will (r° W the
Wavgood for the goodwill of the co.’s business and 10,000
in part satisfaction for stock-in-trade and book debts.
The Standard’s share is to be 10,000 for goodwill, and 5000
in part payment for property, piant, niachinery,
debts, etc. ; after that, a parcel of 20,000 snares
is to be offered for private subscription, ana
the balance of 50,000 to be held in reserve.
The terms are ss. per share on application, ss. on
allotment, and the balance of ss. per share as the
cash is required. The two cos. are to discharge t heir own
liabilities, with the exception of a mortgage of £3250 on
the Wavgood engineers’ shop, which has still four years
to run. The Standard and Waygood, biing private con-
cerns, do not publish balance sheets ; but, according to
the auditor’s report, the Waygood co.’s net profits tor
1907-8, after making all deductions for manage-
ment expenses, directors’ fees, and depreciation,
were £2723. The Standard’s profit for the same
period was £2051. The 1908-9 figures are £3OOO and
£4500 respectively. As regards the capital, The
Bulletin is informed that Waygood “had only a
little over £6OOO paid up capital; but it had accumu-
lated profits; also £BOOO in debentures, which,
of course, are h-ing extinguished. The Standard
had some undivided profits and a reserve of £1995, in
addition to a paid-up capital of £lO,OOO. The reserves
consisted of premiums received for the last issue of shares
privately subscribed.” The promoters of the new co.
think they see a large future for the elevator business here-
abouts in consequence of the growing popularity of the
electric lift, and the proposed flotation is by way of reach-
ing out for the future.

The abridged prospectus of the New Caledonia
Mineral and Smelting Co., Ltd., appears elsewhere in
this issue. The co. holds the patent rights for the Cotton
burner in France and its colonies, and it is proposed to
erect furnaces in New Caledonia for the treatment of. the
nickel ore thereabouts. The capital is £24,000, divided
into 8000 preference and 16,000 ordinary shares at £l.
Preference shares to the number of 80* 0 are now being
offered at 10s. on application, and the balance on allot-
ment. In view of the increasing demand for nickel, and
the estimate that one furnace using Cotton s burner will
earn £20,000 per annum, the promoters figure on erect-
ing two or more furnaces.
N.S.W. Oil.
Apparently the great oil industry which was
created in N.S.W. at an outlay of between half a
million and a million pounds is going to die out
for want of a little Protection. It employed
something like 1500 people at fair wages, and was
likely to double and treble this number ; it built a
railway and created a town in one of the previ-
ously-inaccessible valleys of the Blue Mountains ;
and it put up huge works, and put down shafts,
and “bogged in” marvellously. But, of course,
the great Yankee Oil Trust heard of this, and the
Trust had no idea of allowing a market worth
about £2,000.000 a year to pass from it without an
effort. So its hired missionary or boss agent
hurried out here, and buzzed round to prevent, if
possible, the oil industry getting the Protection it
deserved. In the absence of Protection the
Trust is able to kill any competitor. Out of the
profits it makes elsewhere it can always afford to
sell at a loss in one foolish Freetrade coun-
try where serious opposition threatens—till that
opposition is killed ; and after that, having the
field to itself, it can put up prices and make good
the temporary loss. So the Oil Trust’s agent
buzzed around, and after he had been around for
some time that good old Protectionist, Bill Lyne,
found to his surprise that the majority in favor of
a duty on oil had changed to a minority. There-
fore oil remained unprotected. In this matter
N.S.W. only met with the luck it might have
anticipated. It still returns to the Australian
Parliament a solid body of Foreign-trade Senators,
and it elects a larger proportion of Foreign-trade
Representatives than any other State. It per-
sistently sends to the House Reid, the late
Foreign-trade leader, and Cook, the present
Shoddy leader. Even the constituency in which
the greatoil works are situated returns a Foreign-
trader of the most wretched description. Quite
a number of Foreign-traders from N.S.W.
were prepared to vote with enthusiasm for
a duty, or a bonus, or both of them at
once, for N.S.W. oil, but in that there was
very little comfort for the Deakin-Lyne Ministry.
For Deakin and Lyne knew perfectly well that,
even if the N.S.W. sham Freetraders got the
Protection they wanted for their own oil industry,
they would still sit on the bogus Freetrade side
of the House ; they would still vote against Pro-
tection for every Queensland or Victorian or S.A.
industry ; they would still speak about Deakin
and Lyne as some sort of degraded lunatics for
believing in Protection ; they would still declare
—while hanging on like grim death to Protection
for their own industries—that Protection was a
curse and a cause of ruin ; and they would still do
their level best to drive Deakin and Lyne out of
office because they were Protectionists. It is a
matter of certainty that Deakin and Lyne
did their best to secure Protection for the
N.S.W. oil industry, yet they would be
only human if they grieved very little
when they failed, considering the class of
bumptious* Foreign-trade cranks or hypocrites
with whom they had to do. While N.S.W. elects
unspeakable public fossils and calamities of the
Pulsford and Gould variety to represent it and
to clamor theoretically for Freetrade, it can’t
complain if it gets Freetrade occasionally. It
has got it in the oil industry. And, as a result,
instead of N.S.W. having a monopoly of the Aus-
tralian oil trade, its great oil field is a desolation,
and is drifting back towards its old condition as a
patch of bush in a lone valley on the road to God-
Forgotten.
The Bulletin receives with tears a printed appeal
from the Society of Friends issued in the interests
of peace —sweet, beautiful peace. The Society
urges Australia to remain quite defenceless for
these reasons among others :
We submit that the best protection of any country is
the manifestation of a just and righteous attitude towards
all other countries. ... In the endeavor to live con-
sistently with these principles the Society of Friends and
others holding similar convictions are debarred by con-
science from participation in all and everything connected
with war, and their protest is specially emphatic against
cadet and similar systems of compulsory military training.
We dare still to affirm the convictions with which our re-
ligious society has long been associated, that they who
put their trust in God and endeavor in their conduct to
follow out the “Golden Rule ” will never find their trust
misplaced.
And yet, strangely enough, the Quaker locks up
his house like other men, and he locks up his cash
box and puts it in a locked safe, like other men,
all because of his mean suspicions of his fellow
creatures. And he has his books audited like other
men, simply because he doesn’t believe worth a
cent that “they who put their trust in God
and endeavor in their conduct to follow out the
Golden Rule will never find their trust misplaced.”
And he doesn’t demand separation from Britain
so as to get away from sinful association with
Britain’s great army and navy, and so' make this
country a place which depends wholly on Divine
protection. He doesn't trust neighboring nations
to that extent. Again, no Quaker has sufficient
faith in his fellows to demand the abolition
of the police—a most objectionable class of
fighting men with a beastly habit of carrying
arms. If any country wants to find put for cer-
tain whether it is safe to dispense with an army
and navy, and trust for its safety to the mainte-
nance of “a just and righteous attitude,” it can
always make the experiment on a small scale by
giving the entire police force six months’ holi-
day. The theory about the “manifestation
of a just and righteous attitude towards other
countries ” (or kings or burglars, as the case
may be) is all right; the trouble is that
you and the other fellow often disagree as to what
is a just and righteous attitude. It is in the
struggle to define the attitude that absolutely
harmlass and well-meaning and (in their way)
pious little States like Korea and the last fragment
of the Greek Empire go under. Some day, some
Asiatic State will define a righteous attitude as
the free admission of niggers to this country, and
then our trouble will begin.
♦
Thus a Man of Bitterness :
The Vic. Political Labor Council, which sat from Good
Friday to Easter Monday, passed quite a number of
pleasing resolutions, and adjourned with a lot more un-
decided. It decided that a State system of free medical
aid to prospective mothers should be started ; that the
State Government should provide free breakfast and
dinner to all State scholars ; that State farms, mines, fac-
tories and shops be established ; that a State referendum
should be taken as to whether the Leg. Council, and also
the Leg. Assembly, should be abolished ; that the State
should take control of all hospitals, benevolent asylums,
etc. ; that the State should inaugurate fair rent boards
and a system of advances to settlers, and should market
and advance against produce for export; that it should
establish a State fire, life and general insurance depart-
ment—just here I saw off the list with a jerk. It is all
very good and pretty, and if the money were easily forth-
coming it might be carried out—or it might not. But
whether the cash is available or not, I have long since
ceased to be amused by these cheerful irrelevant demands
for the moon and the gentleman therein. lam weary of
hearing the Laborites incessantly demand that someone
else shall find the coin and bog in and do the work that
the Labor party itself ought to be doing all the while.
If the Laborites would condescend to accept the
assistance of the more advanced Liberals, or of
anybody at all who would help them, they could
speedily carry out the more moderate of their proposals ;
and then, by careful, honest administration, they might
acquire sufficient support to enable them to carry out a
lot more. But this perpetual attitude of standing aloof
and urging one’s opponent to do the work he hasn’t the
slightest desire or intention to do merely excites derision.
As ah American State Governor once remarked to a
Somewhat similar body of delegates: “If you fellows
would resolute less and vote more, .vou’d get what you
want.” These annual series of resolutions are a mere
waste of clean, white paper—to say nothing of time.

That gaudily-named association or shindykit,
“ Empire Builders Ltd.,’’ landed its first dozen
British immigrants in Victoria the other day.
One W. S. Bromhead, an ex-farmer of Ballan
(Vic.), seems to be the chief empire-constructor,
though Scammel, late Westralian immigration
commissioner, is London manager. The Builders’
idea seems to be to form parties of a dozen or so,
who will work together and take up a dozen hold-
ings in common, the Britisher being, according to
Bromhead, a timid person who trembles at the
idea of taking up a block of land on his own, lest
he should be left alone in the dark. It hasn’t
transpired whether the blocks are held in common
by the individual toilers, or whether Empire
Builders Ltd. holds them. Anyhow, the first
arrivals have gone to Bromhead’s late farm at
Ballan, and are now looking for “irrigation blocks
that the Government is expected to have ready
shortly, or for some of the Geelong Harbor Trust’s
blocks.'’ Just so. But a lot of people have been
seeking land in the Murray State for a long
while, so it looks as if Empire Builders Ltd. will
have to do some tremendous hustling if it is going
to build many empires.
The habit seems to be growing on England of
rushing to Belgium and elsewhere for things that
England’s people can make for themselves. Some
time ago, Benn. a member of the London County
Council, wanted to order a quantity of tramway
rails from Leopold’s country because an English
firm asked a little more than the foreign ten-
derers. Benn overlooked —or perhaps he couldn’t
comprehend—that the English firm s employees
would re-distribute the money as wages, and so
keep it in the country, while the Belgians would
simply lift it clean out of Bull’s pocket and leave
a large gnawing vacancy in the national bank
account, and many smaller ones in the stummicks
of Bull’s subjects. However, a majority of the
Council threw the proposal out, and the
Englishman got the job. The present British
Government is, apparently, on the same low
intellectual plane as the lamentable Benn. It
is cabled that Gladstone, Secretary of State for
Home Affairs, has ordered from French and
German firms many thousands of pounds’ worth
of mailbag canvas; so the starving British mill
employee may, later on, send news of his financial
distress enclosed in the cause of it. But the
amazing zeal of the Government in helping the
foreigner doesn’t stop at mailbag canvas ; it has
ordered granite from Norway for the new naval
works at Rosyth in order to “save” a miserable
£30,000. And John Burns was one of those who
defended this folly. There is a pathetically
simple proposition which might have convinced
Burns and Co. that cheapness is not every-
thing if it were not that the benumbing influence
of the Cobden doctrine seems to make the mind
proof against even the simplest and plainest pro-
position. The average income of the British
people is about £42 per head per annum. The
average Briton’s contribution to the national and
local revenue is about £7 per head per annum.
Therefore, for every £GOO which the British Govern-
ment pavs to its own people for tramway rails, or
mailbags or granite, it gets back £lOO ; while for
the £6OO which it pays to the foreigner it gets
back nothing. Consequently, it is cheaper for the
Bull Government to pay £6OO to its own artisan
than £5Ol to the foreigner. That is putting the
matter on a cash basis only. As a question of
humanity the Government which, at a time of the
worst hunger and misery which Britain has known
for many years, sends its work abroad to make a
paltry cash saving which isn’t really a saving but
a loss, is unfit to live, and is certainly not fit to
die.

“BLACK & WHITE
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 20, 1909.
My Dear Artnt,—
The bolt that fell from the very blue sky upon
St. Vincent’s bull was the sudden illness of the
Countess of Dudley. She returned from Monday’s
races with a temperature that rose to 102°. This, as
someone commented, was probably not as high as
her husband’s temper when he read Brother
Snowball’s bright yellow statements about those
three cheers for the King. The ball was a per-
fect mammoth of a success, and if the lovely Lord
looked bored at the start, he brightened up con-
siderably when the operatic sets trailed past him
in humorous and picturesque disorder. Three
fair and young femin nes came along with
the gold lace and Aides, and made the
dais worth looking toward. One of them,
a flaxen-haired, blue-eyed damsel named La-
caita was a visitor at Government House en
route elsewhere by the Ornrah The others were
Miss Ruby Madden and Mrs. Edwin Ryrie. Mrs.
Hore-Ruthven presently made the bunch a four-
leaved shamrock. The crowd round the dais was
kept busy guessing at the what-for-nessof Captain
H.-Ruthven’s medals, with which he is well sup-
plied. The little V. C., a copper, ornament on a dark
red ribbon, dangles in pride of place. I can re-
member only two Australians who got this dis-
tinction in the late armed misunderstanding in
South Africa. One was a Westralian youth, a
clerk in the Customs ; the second, I fancy, was a
Victorian.
The “Duchess of Dantzic” set, headed by Miss
Josephine Marks as the first Empress of the first
Napoleon, took first prize. Speaking for my
humble self, I would have selected the “ Belle of
Mayfair” set as prize winner. Anyhow, Miss Con-
nie Simpson, the girl who led it, had all the prize
things said about her by the onlookers. Also the
Gov.-Gen. commanded her presentation to him.
Mayoress Allen Taylor, in brocaded satin of a
beautiful shade of pink, danced the official
set of quadrilles with our Bird of Paradise Gov.-
Gen. The tangle a lot of the dancers got into was
enough to give the Chief Citizeness a relapse of
nervous prostration.
The effort of the Dudleys to popularise the
quadrille in these wild parts hasn’t been much of
a success, judging bv the experience of last week’s
entertainments. At none of the balls did any of
the dancers—barring those of the vice-regal party
—brave the new-old measure. And yet for weeks
dancing classes had been raging in Sydney at
which the Best People, at the cost of considerable
time, trouble, and cash, learned the quadrille and
all the ramifications thereof. When the moment
came for action they could not find the heart to do
other than cluster round the Government House
set and pass blighting remarks about the methods
of most of its members. Chief Justice Griffith
and acting-C.J. Simpson proved to be a right
featly pair of quadrillers. Gazing on their
sprightly manoeuvrings, I asked myself where
these two grave citizens had gained their pro-
ficiency. And then a horrid picture surged up in
front of my mind’s optic of the twain practising,
text-book in hand, in their respective bed-
chambers—possibly before a looking-glass, con-
ceivably in their slumber-wear. I have the
incredible thing before me now. It is too painful.
I hasten to shut it out.
The Governor-General’s colors, violet and
yellow, are the despair of the decorators.
Under daylight they show out satisfactorily ; but
at night the violet looks a bad sort of pale black,
like a faded Ethiopian. If the G.-G. could have
seen Mr. Layton. early on the night of St.
Vincent’s Ball standing, with tears dimming his
pince-nez, as he gazed at the swathes of violet and
gold that backgrounded the dais, he (the G.-G.)
would have sworn off these tints for evermore.
A much miscalled man is Captain Rome,
A.D.C. to the Governor-General. For weeks
past the dailies in Melbourne and Sydney have
been referring to him as Captain Rowe. Then a
Sydney evening paper caused him a severe shock
by writing of him as Captain Hone. In its
account of the St. Vincent’s Ball a (local) morning
sheet listed him as Captain Horne. Why this
thusness? His name is easily spelled and
memorised, and if you forget it you can always
look up the Watchman. The Rome family was
one of the best known in Queensland twenty
years agone.
If only Chamberlain Lord Richard Nevill would
turn humorously demented enough to issue voting
papers for the best-lookers at the Government
House balls ! At their Excellencies’ first frisk, on
Thursday night, all the 400 present asked the
question of its neighbor, some time during the
evening, “Who looks best in your opinion?”
The replies were in order—(l) Mrs. Clive Dangar,
(2) Miss Ruby Madden, (3) Lady Poore. The
male choice ran mostly to Lady Poore, who was
arrayed in white, with a lot of pink baby roses in
her hair. Miss Madden’s garniture was black,
and the Dangar bride was in bridal-looking array.
Lord Richard, who impinges on the atmosphere
to such an outrageous height when he stands
upright, was in a state of chronic stoop all the
evening answering 400 or so inquirers after the wel-
fare of Lady Dudley. The inquirers couldn’t have
heard his reply through the blare of music if he had
spoken while retaining his natural altitude, and
very few of them heard it even when he doubled
himself up and became a whirly note of interro-

It would take some word-painting to do justice
to the out-of-doors picture—the seascape, land-
scape and skyscrape—of the warships’ search-
lights. The fan-shaped beams lighted the garden
even unto the ballroom doors, outlined the trees,
and worried the goldfish in the fountain basin.
As one of the debutantes remarked, “ The illumi-
nation is just the right degree of clear obscurity,”
which was rather good for an innocent abroad—
in a garden.
A lot of autographed photographs of the Royal
Family help to furnish the tables in the Dudley
drawing-room. There’s an awfully good one of
the King taken in plain clothes of the finest tailor
build. He might be an affable and most gentle-
manly banker and sportsman. And there are a
surprisingly large number of Australian books —
intensely new—as if the wrappers had just been
taken off. Possibly the writers sent them along.
Miss Dorothy Gordon, one of the “ comers-out”
at the Governor-General’s ball, is a granddaughter
of ex-Cbief of Police Foshery and a niece of Mrs.
Dick Horsfall. Miss Nesta Griffiths, a pink and
white and yellow (as to hair), doll-like little party,
was another fledgling ; and Merivale and Docker
damsels also seized the opportunity and budded.
So did Miss Holmes, a lamb of the secretary of
the Water and Sewage Department. More
debutantes are due at the second ball, which
is sandwiched inconveniently between the time
when I write this and the date when you will
read it.
During her stay in Sydney Mrs. Melba will
abide with the Dudleys at Federal Government
House. With her usual do-or-die spirit, she
paid £5O for a special train to run her from Laun-
ceston to Hobart in time to dine with the
Excellencies Strickland. The usual mail snail
would have got her there two hours late.
After a rainy night and a mole-colored forenoon,
the sun and Lady Dudley shone upon the Garden
Party at Government House. The lady looked,
after her late sickness, fragile as the white
camellias in her hat. She was garmented in
white shantung, with insets of lace. A huge
crowd was mostly wearing its race frock.
Mrs. Tom Hughes decked off her jetty raiment
with a hat and ruffle that made the bright, fresh
grass of the lawns look a trifle bleached. Mayoress
Allen Taylor was a study in grey brocade and
grey shoes. The most distinctive frock in the
frocky gathering was Miss Ola Humphrey’s reseda
greeri charmeuse. It was a Princess make, with a
kind of overcoat effect of hand-embroidery
green chiffon, with dull silver embroidery
at the bust. Onp of the new poke hats of
black and white satin, with black plumes, “ went
with ” the bit of artistry.
Girls may be put to many and various works.
Promoters of the “What to do with our Girls”
Exhibition are about to prove as much. The col-
lective girl will, for instance, shoot in the base-
ment of the Town Hall (where there is a miniature
rifle range) for an autograph portrait of Lord
Roberts, given by himself. A daughter of Dr.
Creed is arranging this competition. The Crown-
street Women’s Hospital will give a curious and
interesting demonstration in connection with its
district nursing work. Two rooms will be shown,
one as it was when the nurse arrived, the other as
thesame room was when shehad put thingsinorder.
Hairdressing will be demonstrated ; pottery will
be turned out from the hands of the potteress ; a
band of 24 children, dressed as St. John’s nurses,
will do ambulance work ; and a paper edited by
Mrs. Fotberinghame, of Young Australia and
Splashes, will be sold for a penny a copy. The
Ex. is to be opened by the Countess of Dudley
to-morrow (Wednesday, the 21st), so by the time
this letter reaches you it should be in full blast.
The whisper spreads that the Union Club ball
is degenerating, socially speaking, into a scratch,
sort of affair. Once none but the pure merino and
his ewe-lamb (and likewise his dam and his blanky)
penetrated to it. Now it is hard to find a petty
trader whose wife’s niece, onoe removed, didn’t
“come out” there. The club issues about 1000
invitations ; and wherever in Sydney 1000 people
are gathered together a full two-thirds are bound
to be without the charmed circle. I am told that the
Club—despite the fact that it spent an enormous
sum on decorations and provided a sit-down cham-
pagne supper of amazing excellence and extensive-
ness—cleared over £3OO profit on its show. More-
over, it did thesame last year. What to do with the
surplus cash is the not unpleasing problem the
organisers have now to face. It is rumored that
it may be put into a portable floor for use at
future balls in the Sydney Town Hall. In all
likelihood the Australian Club, which also
executes its hops at the Town Hall, would be
glad to join in that venture. The Town Hall
floor, as at present constituted, is one of the
heaviest, deadest and stickiest to dance on in the
State. Verily any steps taken in the direction of
reforming it would be warmly applauded by the
outgoers who have not yet reached the stage of
dozing in uneasy chairs and draughts, and hoping
for the arrival of midnight and the home-bound
cab.
Mrs. Arthur Allen was one of the local best
gowners on Sydney Cup day. She lighted up her
dismal-hued mole crSpe de chine with rose velvet
and a rose-colored bag. Of course every wearer
of mole admits that it is a distinct shade that was
put on the market as a subtle compliment to the
London fog. I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t
see a shred of anything in its color after the
present wearers of it have frayed their gowns.
No one will demand more mole.
One of the prettiest of race garnitures was a pale
heliotrope, silky-fleecy thing with deeper helio-
trope decorations of ribbon velvet. The girl who
wore it carried a lace muff with a spray of lily of
the valley. The new “bridge” color was ex-
ploited by Mrs. Mark Foy. It is a shade of pea-
cock blue. Someone else was in purple and fine
ninon, with gold shoes bearing a monogram.
The bunch of brides looked radiant enough, and
fluffy and unregretful. Mrs. Maughan, Mrs.
Rundle, Mrs. Dangar, and Mrs. Horace Walker.
They were all there. Every bride looks as if she
thought she had invented matrimony. One of the
best creations in clothes was Miss J. O’Keefe’s
magenta cloth directoire coat and skirt, worn with
a black jetted hat. Mrs. Coleman Burke and
Mrs. Hamilton Dobbie were tailor-made at some
of the meetings, showing the latest things in
stripes and buttons. Miss Ola Humphrey, who
came with Mrs. J. C. Williamson, was in pale-ale
Ottoman silk made with a long coat with big
pockets and insinuations of emerald-green velvet
and cream lace. Mrs. Williamson had gotten
herself into white lace.
The naval men at the A. J.C. races all backed
Hyman owing to a dream of one of their number,
and all won. The vision of the dreamer’s head
upon his bed concerned a horse of Hyman’s num-
ber and color, and adorned with a jockey gar-
nished as was Hyman’s rider. Then all he had to
do was to find the animal’s name and put down
the money. Mrs. Ewan Frazer was another
dreamer who visioned correctly.
The Herbert Powers—his horse won the Derby
last spring in Melbourne—are here with their
daughter for the horse and ball week. Another
Melbournian, Mrs. Ernest Brookes, took the
honors for frocks and looks at some of the meet-
ings. Her mole-colored velvet, with emerald-
green at waist (the directoire waist), and her
toque amounted to an achievement in “dress-
developing.”
A man writes me from Bathurst
The S. M. Herald, which joyfully acknowledged a
Dreadnought donation of £O4 from Mr. P. J. Creath, of
Bathurst, the other day, and later was foreed to wipe the
deceptive thing off its iist, wasn’t the only sheet to fall in
at the hands of disloj'al jesters in this hamlet. The Tele-
graph was also forwarded a flagrantly “eronk” cheque
for £5O, inscribed “ S. Jennings.” Luckily for itself, the
’Graph isn’t running a Deadhorse fund on its own, and so
it passed the worthless document on to Allen Taylor.
Allen straightway took to ink and inscribed a rapturous
message of thanks and good cheer, the which ultimately
reached one Sam Jennings, a man of color, and
a well-known toiler in the Anti-Sosh cause in Bathurst.
Samuel, a simple bush-dweller, unversed in but pro-
foundly mistrustful of city ways, was at first stupefied,
then enraged. He conceived the idea that he had in
some way been cheated out of a handsome wad of money.
And so he caused a note of defiance and stern protest to
be sent to Allen Taylor, coupled with an imperative
demand for a refund. There the matter rests for the
present. The right-thinkers of Bathurst (hotelkeepers,
Empire Leaguers, and so forth) are highly incensed over
the affair, and wander helplessly round the town, mut-
tering the words “Dingoes” and “Highly Disloyal,” as
though immersed in a horrid dream or alcohol.
For a whole week the greatness of Knight
Francis Suttor and Mr. Agricultural Show Somers
has been a-ripening, and now that the Show is
closed no Cardinal Wolsey or frilled lizard ever
wore his ruffles more proudly than do that brace
of gentlemen. For they are able to announce that
the Show has beaten all its forerunners in the
matter of records. Over 246,000 persons passed
through the turnstiles, and the Society has safely
Chubbed close upon £ll,OOO. The fact that two
Germans chopped best in the log-hewing contest
must be a fly in the milk of the swollen infant who
sent his Dreadnought coppers to the Herald
with the intimation that they were to help to
keep out the “nasty Germans.”
The “ Wally ’’ Marks’s are back in good form
and beautiful clothes from a sojourn in foreign
lands and English waters. Mostly the latter, for
he is a gallant yachtsman, and troubled the surface
of things greatly in fine yachts with the Lipton
magnate for company. She is very smart in a
white tailor made and black vest.
The McQuade-Ohls marriage was precipitated
by the ardent bridegroom, and the wedding
service was spoken among the eternal bills at
Blackheath, in the Blue Mountains. Mr. Fred’s
parents are wealthy, and the youngster himself
revels in some £7O a year for his captaincy in the
2nd V.I. Regiment. Mrs. Betty McQuade goes
to Melbourne to play in “ The King of Cadonia"
by-and-bye.
In St. James’s Church, Morpeth, recently were
wedded Catherine, the youngest daughter of
Colonel R. A. Waddy, manager of the Commer-
cial Bank at Morpeth, to Mr. Lewis O. Mac-
kenzie, son of Mr. N. J. Mackenzie, of Parra-
matta. Waddy is a name well known in N.S.W.
In the early 'thirties the 50th Regiment came to
Australia, and amongst the ensigns was one
Richard Waddy. Years afterward the same
armed force ambled back this way, and by that
time Richard Waddy was colonel. Two younger
male Waddies remained here when their father
finally departed, and, being planted in fertile soil,
they took root and reared more Waddies.
An admirer of Kiddy Tith. sends me this
high 0. about him : —“ Dion Titheradge, though
only a boy and a beauty one at that, puts
up a fine amount of real ambition apart
from the business of toiling on the stage-
plank. The beauty-boy has dreams of wider
fields. In odd moments between touring
the States, and during the hours that are not
bequeathed to food-taking and rehearsing, the
youthful Dion is occupied with a fluent pen and a
pot of ink drafting out a drama that may hold the
world some day. The elder Titheradge, father of
the young glad god, has reached Sydney after a
bad illness, and recruits at Rose Bay with his
daughter, Mrs. Doctor Knowles (the Miss Lily
Titheradge of other stage days—she who was such
a bright, lovable boy in the ‘Two Little Vaga-
bonds’). There Tith. promotes the growth of a
timely beard and considers the sea-waves in all
their glory.”
Madge Mclntosh has agreed, prior to her de-
parture from Australia, to appear in the Stage
Society’s forthcoming production of Rostand’s
“Fantastics.” It is an idyllic play by the
author of “L’Aiglon,” and will present a
judicious contrast to the grim realism of
Ibsen which was chosen by the Society
for its first performance last year. Miss
Mclntosh’s conception of the difficult part of the
heroine will be interesting from the fact that
she was the original exponent of the part
in the production of “The Fantastics”
in London. The play is a poetic and
naive burlesque of Sbakspeare’s “Romeo and
Juliet.” Only a Frenchman would think of
burlesquing Mr. Romeo Montague and Miss
Juliet Capulet. The production will take place
at a matinee at the Criterion on April 30.
The Freddie Shipmans are back in Sydney from
a tour of Victoria. Their new investment, J. W.
Bengough, arrived yesterday by the Makura. Ben-
gough is a cartoonist, poet, reciter and comedian,
and Freddie Shipman will back him as able to make
even the Goddess of Melancholy laugh. An
Irish mother, a Scotch father, and a birthplace at
Toronto are items at the back of the “ man who
draws ’’ and who will prove himself next Saturday
night at the Centenary Hall.
Anew Australian four-act comedy-drama, “Out
on the Castlereagh,” by Mr. J. C. Lee, will be
staged at the Palace on Saturday afternoon,
May 1, at two of the clock. The bantling goes
on under the auspices of the Playgoers’
Club.
With great enthusiasm I copy a letter that has
just reached me :
Dear Madam Ak . I can’t spell your infernal pen
name, and I haven’t The Bulletin by me to refer to.
Your account of some nameless Hospital, where only
dying or dead people go—people who are “ stiff ” in both
senses —moved me one guinea. Please find cheque for
that amount enclosed.
Yours truly, •
I found the cheque as directed. The institution
of which I wrote was the Hospice of the Sacred
Heart at Darlinghurst, and it will feel real glad
to get the donation of the man who couldn’t re-
member my infernal pen-name.
Dr. C. W. MacCarthv’s youngest son has died
at Calcutta at the age of 23 years. He was study-
ing for the Bar. Ex- violiniste Maud MacCarthy still
pursues the esoteric and teaches the occult in an
Indian college.
This State’s old friend. Lord Carrington, has a
claimant for the hand of his Australian-born
daughter Myee. Viscount Bnrv, eldest son of the
Earl of Albemarle, a Scots Guardsman, aged 27
years, is the party to whom the lady has Said
“Yes.” His real name is Keppel, which sounds
a lot better than Bury. The real name of a man
with a title like that should be Christian Berriel.
After reading the Theatre for April one feels
knowledge-crammed on the subjects of plays and
players, and music and musicians in Australia.
From the front cover Harry Rickards glowers as
Napoleon, and on the last pages the late John
Sheridan makes up for his Widow O’Brien r6le.
An article on “ Orchestral Music ” is an educative
effort from someone who knows his way about
amid the fearsome herd of instruments that com-
pose an orchestra. Dozens of portraits and some
scenes from current plays and considerable bright
anecdotage make the Theatre well worth acquir-
ing. And it may be acquired for three pennies.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


AFTER ten years’ preparation, and an expenditure
°f The Times has published a book
which meets what has long been the most
notable want in English literature—a complete
history of mankind.
Judging from the importance—the supreme
importance—of the subject, and the appeal which its
intense interest makes to every man and woman, one
might well expect to find in every house, where books
are read at all, some history which had already taken
its place as a standard work.
So little is this the case, however, that we find no
complete history published in English since 1779, and
anything but the most fragmentary and one-sided
knowledge of this greatest of subjects may be looked
upon as the rarest accomplishment.
Why no complete history has appeared
for 130 years.
The reason for the long delay in meeting so
obvious a need is to be found in the fact that the 19th
century, for all its host of brilliant historians, was too
much concerned with elucidating the true facts of
history to consider the claims of the general reader,
and gather for him the results of all the immense body
of constructive research which has made the past
century no less remarkable for its historical than for
its scientific progress. Indeed, had the 19th century
accomplished less for the advancement of history, it
is probable that the reader would long since have
been given a work which would have performed for
him the service effected for the 18th century reader
by the famous Universal History, edited by the
novelist Smollett, and published, in sixty small
volumes, in 1779. But the achievement of the 19th
century was so great as to amount to a revolution in
the study of history. Inspired by a keen sense of the
truth that humanity is the same in all ages, by a
critical spirit that refuses to accept legends, and by a
new historical conscience that demanded the scientific
comparison of all available sources, hundreds of
illustrious historians, specialising each upon a par-
ticular period, so changed the whole aspect of
historical study that Smollett’s publication would
scarcely be more acceptable to-day than an 18th
century work of science. While, then, the illustrious
historians of the 19th century did so much for history
that they may be said to have re-made it, they did
little for the general reader, who, at the end of the
century, found himself faced literally by thousands of
admirable historical works, scarcely one of which was
intended for his reading, and forming so immense a
mass of material as .only the professed student of
history could attempt to cope with. The historical
knowledge of our day is beyond comparison greater
than that of the 18th century. Its general diffusion
is probably less.
The universal appeal of history.
It was impossible that such a state of affairs
should last. The writing of history had rightly
become the affair of specialists ; but the reading of it
is for all men and women. Unlike the sciences—
from the advance of which at the hands of specialists
a non-participating public reaps practical benefits—
historical research does not achieve its ultimate object
until the truths which it has established are made
familiar to the world at large.
A book for the 20th century.
This is the service performed by the Historians’
History of the World, and the work has been brought
to a conclusion at an epoch when the value of this
service is particularly appreciable. The British world
in the 19th century was engrossed in two interests—
the final triumph of democracy, and the extension of
the empire to its utmost limits. The consideration
of what was thereafter to come exercised only a few
heads. The 20th century has opened upon a very
different attitude, and a mood of extreme self-
consciousness. The question of “ what next ? ” is
present to all minds, with the knowledge, also, that
the future depends no longer upon the wisdom and
foresight of a few, but upon the temper and judgment
of every individual in this country, and, indeed in the
whole mass of the empire. “ Our hopes of the
future depend on a sound understanding of the
past ” : we have been granted but one guide for what
is to come —the record of what has already happened,
an experience which constitutes the one true school
of political judgment. Very opportune, therefore, is
the appearance of a work which renders this priceless
record in the full sweep of its progress through all
ages and m every country.
The 84=page prospectus.
For the manner in which the Historians’ History
of the World achieves its task, the reader is referred
to the 84-page prospectus
which The Times has issued,
and sends gratis and post free
upon request, in order that
every one may form his own
independent judgment. With
a very full description of the
work and the manner of its
composition, there are also
included a large number of
specimen pages and illustra-
tions, and an outline of the
contents of each volume. From
this pamphlet the reader will
see that the Historians’ History
of the World is the result of a
vast scheme of collaboration ;
that the first living authorities
in every branch of historical
knowledge have assisted in its
composition, which yet retains
the best of the priceless work
done by their predecessors ; that
it realises the ideal put forward
by Freeman, Lord Acton, and
other great historians, in pre-
senting history as one consecu-
tive whole from first to last and
in all countries, yet with such
detail that the treatment of
each country in the History is
as full as that to be found in
any standard history dealing
with a separate country ; that
the narrative begins with the
earliest known records of man,
forty or more centuries before
Christ, and comes down to the
year 1908.
More exciting than
romance.
Above all, the reader will
see that throughout the entire
work, the prime object has been
to give history—or rather to
allow it fully to retain—its great
quality of strong human interest.
For variety of individual
character, intensity of situa-
tions, swift sequence of events,
history far surpasses in interest
the most exciting romance, and in the volumes of the
Historians’ History the possessor will have a library
of the most entertaining, as well as of the most
profitable, reading imaginable.
The common experience of the human race —if
anything is profitable to know, it must surely be this,
and if use did not blind the eyes to odd phenomena,
it would seem a very strange thing indeed that even
the man who is exceptionally well informed has to
admit that most of what has happened in the world
remains unknown to him. Strange, indeed, for it is
his own story, containing the best knowledge that the
world holds, and compact of such narratives as not
the most exciting fiction can match for interest.
The cheapest book in the world.
One word, however, must be added as to the sale
of the Historians’ History, for which the subscrip-
tion list opened in Australia last Saturday. It
was the desire of The Times to place within easy
reach of all a work which appeals with equal
attraction to all sorts and conditions of men. It has
attained its object in this respect by naming a price
which is about one-sixth of the prices ordinarily
charged for new books, and by rendering this low
price payable in small instalments.
For a first payment of only 7/6,
the complete 25 volumes (with the oak book-case if
required), will be delivered carriage free within a
large area, and purchase may be completed in a series
of monthly payments of the
same small amount. The
History is thus indeed brought
within the means of anyone
who wishes to have it.
But this low price and these
easy terms are named only in
respect of copies for which
prompt application is received.
The subscription list for the
United Kingdom closed on June
Bth last, and already the price of
the History in London has been
THE HISTORIANS' HISTORY OF THE WORLD:
the 25 handsome volumes in the oak bookcase.
The volumes measure IO J f inches high, by 7 inches wide, by 2fz inches
thick, and while they make a brave show, they are not in the way even in ttie
smallest room, for the bookcase (which measures 4 feet high and 2 feet wide)
projects but p inches fi'om the wall against which it stands.
raised by £3 2S. 6d. The subscription list which
now opens in Australia will be closed after a short
interval, and then the price of the History will be
raised by a similar amount in the Commonwealth.
The Times employs no agents, and, at the present
price and upon the subscription terms, the- volumes
can be purchased only direct from one of the offices
of The Times in Australia,* and by means of the
official subscription form issued by The Times and
sent out, upon request, gratis and post free, with the
descriptive pamphlet. Use inquiry form printed
below , and you will thus obtain, with prospectus of
the History, a form showing subscription prices and
terms. Should you then wish to purchase, you have
but to fill in the form, and post it with postal note
for 7/6, and the complete work will be sent to you.
Our stock has arrived in Australia and is ready for
immediate delivery.
The subject of history possesses an attraction so
universal, and the announcement of the first complete
history issued for English readers since the decade
preceding the French Revolution will excite so much
curiosity, that a large proportion among readers o'
The Bulletin will want to see the prospectus. •

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 19, 1909.
My Dear Yarrik,—-
An up-to-date fashion that is growing fast in
this period when Merely Sarah Jane is practically
extinct is for a hostess to give her At Homes any-
where but at home ; anywhere out of the way and
worry of the local cook and Sairey Ann. One’s
domestics must be treated with placidity and
routine. Is it any wonder that the horrid
upheaval of from 20 to 100 scandal-hissing
women with enlarged appetites for tea and
the unhealthy ice makes Maria groan; and
the prospect of the earthquake being repeated,
with indefinite demands for fruit salad and “extra
cakes” all down a vista of dreary months, causes
Sarah to give notice on the spot ? The Chicago
meets the case valiantly with full-fledged
fortnightly concerts in the Winter Garden,
where the casual tea drinker may drop
in as usual for her nectar, or a hostess
may ring up and demand a table or a dozen tables
for her guests. All the dainties are prepared,
the flowers are arranged, the waitresses are ready,
without any more to do than a telephone ring.
Singers and an orchestra punctuate the chatter,
and everything is as wickedly gossipy as it would
be in the hostess’ own house, with none of the
wild arranging for catering and heart-burning
argument with half-friendly, half-professional
afternoon-tea warblers. Maria is placidly getting
dinner at home, and Missus is At Home in the dim
distance, far from the sacred home circle, and every-
thing is as happy as a wake. Miss Siegenberg, a
clever pianist, arranges the programmesand accom-
panies the budding songstresses. The first con-
cert is on Tuesday (27th), and they continue
throughout the winter. Men are even entrapped
to these smooth-running entertainments, and a
large, athletic citizen may be seen balancing an
eighth of an inch of cup and a saucer the size of a
postage stamp on a fleeting semblance of a table
while he endeavors to keep pace with the conver-
sation. Men ar<! rarities, however, and the
women scarcely miss them.
Guy the Fat—Guy the Military—has distin-
guished himself during the Easter manoeuvres by
almost growing thin in the defence of his country.
Adoring sassiety gels are pampering the hero to
the uttermost. The hope of the Madden
throng held a siege at Langwarrin witli
an army of unfed men, and, short of
giving his valiant henchmen steaks cut from
succulent parts of hisself, the captain did all an
Australian soldier could do to find provender for
his followers. It was the same old Easter blunder-
ing, but perhaps the inevitable error in com-
missariat helped to lend an air of reality to the
proceedings, and gave the army an inward con-
viction (about the waistbelt) that it was on a real
forced march to meet a real enemy. Usually there
is the sofggy weather of Eastertide to help matters
to a comfortable conclusion, but this year the pro-
gramme was merely varied by hurricanes and dust
storms and the flying into the camp of all the
casual brown paper in creation. The long, white
ti-tree-fringed road that trails for miles round the
bay to Frankston and Langwarrin and the Heads
has been in constant unrest with marching troops,
and dusky, mysterious khaki mounted men have
clattered through in the dim hours. Throughout
the whole Easter the beaches alongside have been
patrolled by quiet little Japs—peaceful tradesmen
from the city—who have strolled along in medita-
tion and isolation, watching the military
manoeuvres of the very young nation with that
interest which military proceedings always awake
in the drapery store person or the small back
street grocer.
Mrs. Aronsen gave an At Home at Locksley on
Friday, and the event was thronged with theatri-
cals. These thronging theatricals were a most
lookable crowd. The two Beauty Burtons had all
the men from the Nellie Stewart co. following in
the tail of the comet. Madge Mclntosh, trailing
a mournful garb of grey and black, said “How
do ” for a few odd minutes on her way to Sydney,
and exchanged gossip with the newly-arrived
Londoners. Madge Mclntosh rushes over to help
the Stage Society in Sydney with some heart-
stirring play it intends to perpetrate. She departs
to her Fogland on May 4 by the Orotava. Stage-
manager Tapping—he of the Titheradge aspect—
was implored to call off rehearsals for that morn-
ing, and thus leave time for a fraternal fare-
welling. There was some decided musical talent
in the party, and St. Kilda-road neighbors
looked in to tea. Mrs. Ohennery, with dull
peacock tones perched in the turban on
her fair hair, and Mrs. Keogh, in black fure and
tomato-colored frocking, were on the list. Some
of the poor, ignorant English people came out
thinking they would strike a tropical Indian
winter. Mr. dark-villAin Claude King wondered
at the frosty air, and groaned about the fifty
white suits he’d brought along. He had had
visions of a punkah, and ice, and deck chairs.
Mrs. Aronsen was garbed in black, and she
received against the background of a huge Soutar
screen, with a real Soutar cat looking the size of a
tiger.
The Worshipful Jacobis, who have several
times occupied the mayoral chairs of St. Kilda,
send out pasteboards for a ball in the hall of the
mighty on Thursday, May 27.
One of the local amusements at a Melbourne
fashionable tavern is a family that is travelling for
educational purposes. The wealthy trio who
have struck oil or soap or a new paper-fastener,
have been driven forth by a cold society in some
foreign town that will not recognise wealth-in-
the-rough. Like Jo, they “ keep moving,” but
with the cuteness that procured for them the
Midas-bags, the yare determined that the expen-
sive “ moving-on” will return dividends in polish.
With them travels a courier, guide, tutor, phi-
losopher, and friend-in-need with the correct
hair-parting and a crease in his pant-legs that
will cut butter ; also an unbounded knowledge of
The Thing. And his “salary ” causes a shine on
his face like the morning sun. The most im-
mediate lesson is teaching Mommer to smoke in a
ladylike manner in the lounge.
The South Yarra Tennis Club, which took a
fresh lease of fashionable life after the recent
boundings in Melbourne for the International
Davis Cup, is putting on extra frill in the
way of club adornment. Frill costs money,
and several champion bounding tennisites,
who are also good at amateur mumming,
intend to help matters by the inevitable Mock
Mummer Show. A most artistic programme
announces “Oh, Susannah!” (which sounds
exciting and exclamatory) in the big Town
Hall at P’ran (which counts swagger) on Wednes-
day, 28th. The energetic Claude Hall engineers
the show, and the oast holds such important
names as Maxwell-Hvslop, Seott-Laing, William-
son, Daniell, and Miss Broughton.
A fashionable sea-suburban beach has just lost
its ultra snappy bit of bather. The sharks Bad
nothin" to do with the disappearance; the lady
has merely returned to her townly winter resi-
d=*nce. The lady never hid under a bushel the
facts of her pedigree, and even the jelly-fish
knew that the family tree sent its roots far
beyond the upstart Conqueror—right on to
the kings who fell under the Round Table
after dinner, and lay on the rush-covered floor.
The bather met her matrimonial fate in the
billing and cooing on rustic benches of the ti-tree
gardens (the engagement will shortly be made
publio in all solemnity and dignity), and the
fiance used daily to swim alongside his Araminta-
of-pedigree and hold a parasol over her
complexion as she braved the briny. Tights,
stockings and long gloves, also the most correct
ballet bathing shoes, added to the glory of the
Special Bather’s every morning dress for her dip,
and four veils, of varying thickness, protected her
facial cuticle while her locks dried in the sun—
usually with the devoted fiance (who recognised
the deference due to her pedigree), helping the
drying with a fan. The cottagers of that beach
do miss their morning panto.
Melbourne is flush of First Nights now, after a
long summer of same old panto. Meynell and
Gunn, at the Royal, brought their Ruth Lincoln,
the girl behind the counter, right on the red heels
of Sweet Nell Bellairs. A jovial, packed house
signified its delighted release from months of the
tired jokes of “Cinderella.” Rupert Clarke and
a beaming cage-full of men pals shone from the
manager’s box. A military push, sans gold
lace or glitter, was in the pen below with
Commandant Stanley wedged upright, like a
pleased poker. The Raleighs, back from the
Easter races, brought a party. The Frocky Lady
wore pale pink, and very little of it, but added a
friendly cape of cloud blue. The Railway Taits
giggled in the stalls when Brett versed Poppa
into his song. The bud of the family has “put
up” her dusky locks, and wore them bunched
into ribbons, like flax on a spinning wheel.
Frankie Oliver-Murray drooped in pale chiffons,
and Madge Mclntosh wore very little on the
shoulders that shone from the stalls. Mrs.
Tallis’s all-shiny sequins on blue hostessed a
frocky party. Mrs. newly-wed Boyd wore blue
bows in her hair. Jet glittered all about in the
dusk of the circle waving in ultra-fashionable
thatches.
On the stage there are lots of girls behind the
counter. Ruth Lincoln, the talked-about girl,
wears a simple outfit decked with roses. The
others, who nave a habit of coming forward to
pirouette and sing, wear demure brown. But
when they dance, it is one wild frothy whirl of
baby pink frou-frou and frill, with gleams of
plump copper limb and jewelled garter. The
demureness of those 30-odd shop girls is sadly mis-
leading, and their leading spirit, Miss Rose, the
milliner of the show, has a habit of high-kicking
the hats of gentlemen customers into thin ether.
To balance matters she sells their expostulating
wives 10 guineas’ worth of “creations ” as a paci-
fier —at the husband’s expense.
The prettiest girl in the shop is Essie Perrin,
who minds the cash desk. Fortunately she gets
an “evening off,” and dances through it with
Tom Payne. Essie is Tom’s little “cough drop.”
Tom goes to a carnival ostensibly as Little Boy
Blue, but really he’s the Little Boy
at Manly from the tassel on his cap to
his turned-up frilled pantaloons. Essie Per-
rin dances in adorable changes from pink
and Persian lamb as a Greenaway girl to
pale blue and white and cerise. She is the
daintiest bit of frou-frou in the piece, and her ash
fair hair and complexion and her teeth are all her
own—so are her vivacity and her dancing.
Cromwell, as a Merrv-Widow waiter has all too
short a part. He does not appear till the second
act; but he garners in all the laughs to
himself when he does dryly happen. Roland
Bottdmley —an English fop—-has just been
to a “ bargain sale of pyjamas he-he,” and
gets in a song to Emmeline Orford while
she perpetrates manicure on his paws. Bari-
tone Tborley brings vigor and breeze into the
hothouse atmosphere from .some far country where
one “Dig—dig—digs.” He’s impressive enough
to win the heart of the extra-special Girl Behind
the Counter —who happens to be a Duchess or
something in disguise. Then the chorus all sing
and dance about the matter, and .Ruth Lincoln
and Thorley do all their love-making in song duet,
which is pleasant for the audience.
Eugenie Duggan made a final Australian
appearance before departing to the centre of the
empire’s greatness. Mrs. “Bill’’has never been
to London before, and she goes to absorb new
dreams of dress. No one could ever count
Eugenie Duggan’s stage frocking merely as dresses
—her garments are “gowns.” Their riot of
melody, their arpeggios, their crash of chords and
crescendo often lift them to the rank of composi-
tions and creations, but they are never meredresses.
“ The French Spy ” is like two orchestras play-
ing at once. Frances Ross, in all her fantastic
fancy of frocking, is on the boards at the same
time, and when Miss Ross has them all on she
shouldn’t be bn the boards simultaneously ; she
should be published in three instalments. Frances
even dies in the tightest of green directoire gowns,
and there is not a crease in the fashion-plate lines
nor yet a speck of blood to mark the “genteel”
death. She would never forget her “manners”
and die clumsily. “Genteel” is an almost
obsolete word that lives again in the big-eyed
villai ness.
This is a story to be whispered when the lights
are dim and low. Some months back Melbourne
was interested in the public cooings and doings of
a notoriously dressy charmer and her new “ boy,”
whose English name is as familiar in our mouths as
the Australian household name of her old “ boy.”
People were in doubt as to whether the Queen of
Costumes had definitely changed her representa-
tive adorer, and was about to take the imported
stranger for her Prince Consort with the acquies-
cence of her old unlawful friend, or whether the
triangular arrangement was merely temporary.
Seemingly it was intended to be temporary only ;
but it led to an unsettled state of things. From
another State comes the news that the Queen
and her original Lord Chamberlain were
lately staying at the same hotel, with a
maid of honor in attendance on the Sovereign
Lady. Also at the' same hotel stayed the
English adorer, as it happened. His presence,
however, was not necessarily responsible for the
tragedy that followed. The fact of his being one
of the boarders at the hotel is mentioned without
comment. One night the Queen had a terrible
experience—almost too terrible for words ! The
noise of somebody trying to unlock or force the
door of her bedroom from the outside had awak-
ened her from slumber, and she protested against
this outrage with a vehemence which seemingly
scared the would-be intruder away. The Queen,
all the same, wafe>too excited to resume her slum-
ber as though nothing had happened. In a pic-
turesque dressing-gown she sped to the apartment
of her original adorer—and found him not alone.
The other lady—the maid of honor—was his com-
panion. This unfortunate discovery caused more
excitement, and the party of three got notice to
quit the hotel next morning.
Once no one knew anything about the ’flu’—at
least, not under that name. So far as human beings
are concerned the discovery of ’flu’ isn’t a thing to
be thankful for, but it’s real mean to hand the
scourge on to plants. A botanist who has been
poking about in Chili claims to have discovered
a plant that coughs and sneezes. Of course plants
breathe, but this little cuss can’t stand a grain of
dust on its leaves, and when one lodges there it
clears its throat violently, and makes almost
human sounds through its nose. A vegetable
with a cold in the head must be a pathetic spec-
tacle, for it can’t get out of the draught, or shut
the window, or move to new diggings if the
foundations of its present quarters are damp and
the plumbing ineffective.
A certain mummer, who is not given to splash-
ing money about, likes to meet people who will
be of some use in the struggle to save his meagre
£2O or £lOO a week from being dissipated to the four
winds. The young man was recently introduced
to the eldest hopeful of a family that cures the
succulent pig. The association was too tempting.
The mummer suggested that a ham be passed up
to him over the footlights—“ For a joke, you
know, old man.” The man who made a living out
of pigs agreed, but it was an excellent wooden
imitation bit of pig, weighted with an internal
brick, that went over the lights with the usual
vegetables. The fellow-mummers (who were in
the joke) have been met with a baffling silence
from the actor who bowed and beamed so joyously
over his prospective bacon. The other members
of the co. conclude that the thrifty one has at
least been cured of the habit of asking for
donations of provender, as though he were a bene-
volent institution or a newsboys’ picnic.
From “Kosna” in Adelaide beside the Tor-
rens :
Their new Excellencies are still viewing this landscape.
They have had Sir Charles Lucas, of the Colonial Office,
staying at the Residence, and have been making sure
that he also viewed the landscape. They have carefully
considered Port Adelaide ; they have been to Glenelg
where we were originally declared a province—never,
never were we a mere colony ; and they have been shown
the historical gum-tree and the breakwater which is just
sprouting. Also, they were given tea in the kiosk by the
mayoral folk. They went over Parliament House on
Tuesday, and the Speaker Coles put flowers in that edi-
fice’s hair, and had an official tea-party.
Furthermore, have looked the School of Mines in the
face, and they still live, even like those persons who
looked Nebuchadnezzar in the eye and were not burned
up by his wrath. And they have spoken kindly to the
University. Lady Bosanquet went to the Crbche One
day, and on Friday there was a dinner party at the Resi-
dence, and an At Home afterwards. In fact, the numer-
ousness of the social excitements is making us perfectly
light-headed. We are not accustomed to all this rush.
South Australia has no luck in the matter of Easter
Monday. It always pours cats and dogs, or some large
commodity like that. This year it was something extra
in the way of cats and dogs, and the crowd that went to
the Orikaparinga meeting was a bogged multitude. You
couldn’t see much of the races when you got there, but
you could see plenty of the rain and the lightning. A
drowned populace ate its drowned luncheon, and said it
was enjoying itself very much. It said it frequently—in
fact, it did protest too much. His Ex., being a strenuous
soul, climbed through the weather in a motor, with an
aide or so ; the Tom Barr Smiths were on hand in their
motor ; and there were the usual drag-loads of folk who
furnished an interesting guessing competition. You saw
sundry muddy horses, a vehicle caked with mud, and a
number of people buried to the eyes in muddy macin-
toshes. Then, if you guessed who they were, you took
the prize.
The Chief Justice Ways are taking unto themselves
Victoria Park on Friday afternoon, and very many
Masons (Free, not stone) will wander among the flora of
that decorative locality, and have ditties sung at them,
and tea and food handed to them. The Chief Justice is a
kind of arc light among local Freemasons, and the pro
ceedings are to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of the Grand Lodge under the Constitu-
tion of South Australia.
On Thursday of last week the same Ways had the Royal
Society of St. George and its wife to tea in their gardens
at Montifiore. These gardens are full of birds and trees
and rockeries and things, and have a view that you could
live on for a year without other sustenance. The Royal
Society is one of the countless institutions ot which the
Chief is president. He is president of practically every-
thing in S. A. A more numerous man doesn’t exist.
They sold the poor old North Adelaide tram horses the
other day. Father Backblox, down for Easter, was at
the sale in hundreds, and over £2OOO was realised for 140
lean car-draggers. They were mostly bought for hat-
racks. A shilling entrance fee was charged, the money
so accumulated going to charity ; and as there were 1000
or 1500 folk present, charity is a pretty happy jade for
the moment. The highest price realised for any one
Bucephalus was £B6 10s.
The trail of the bowler has been over the land, and the
whole bowling populace has had a wild and scrimmagy
time. The visiting t’othersiders were received with open
arms, and the this-siders sprung much entertainment on
them. One night the balcony of the Tivoli was bodily
reserved for them, and afterwards there was a supper,
which lasted into the dim and early hours of fowl-sing-
out, or thereabouts. At this function presentations
were flung broadcast at various officials and their nicei
halves.
The Doubleday kiddy has flung the scarlet fever fiend
far from her, and is once more grappling with concertos
by Blfgkwstrpvkhbyzski and other persons of genius.
The youngster writes mournfully of two whole months’
lessons'missed, but adds that there are none of the usual
scarlet fever complications. Also she sends news of two
melodious damsels, Emily Dyason and Erna Mueller, who
went touring in the Kubelik train a while back. Both
are in Vienna, toiling to further'improve their music.
Emily Dyason is already with one of those clever persons
with the sneezeful names, who are the stepping-stones
to the great Leteschetsky, the spelling of whose beautiful
appellation is too much for my youth and inexperience.
Jean Martin is back here with the Knight and Day
company, looking as beauteous as ever, but with no
noticeable increase in the one and a half word parts of
yore. Still the stage glamor hasn’t departed. The
damsel is regarded fixedly from the circle every night,
and by day she is carried off bodily by a crowd of her old
chums.
The University Shakspeare Society is going to get into
the Lyric Club premises by force if necessary one evening
very soon, and act the plays of the late lamented William
in fragments for the satisfaction of as much of the popu-
lace as the building can hold. There is a world-wide
demand for the plays of Shakspeare to be acted by this
society. Most of the recent unrest in Turkey and Servia
has arisen because of the haggard uncertainty as to the
date of the performance.
The Edwin Smith dame had a crowded half-minute the
other day. She was driving, and one of the horses in her
carriage arose and wanted to climb an electric-light post,
or something o{ the kind, in the middle of King William-,
street. Being remonstrated with, he became angry, and
carelessly flung the occupants of the carriage into the
atmosphere, tore up a bit of the road, and sat upon a
pony cart and a few occupants. The chief sufferer was
the steed’s owner. The doctors are now trying to put
certain of her ribs once more on a sound basis.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.

Mr. John Hamilton, South and Drummond
Streets, Ballarat (Vic.), writes VChamberlain’s
Tablets are our family medicine. I strongly
recommend them to anyone who suffers from con-
stipation, biliousness or any other disorder of the
stomach or liver.” Constipation is a most diffi-
cult complaint to cure ; most of the advertised pills,
because they act as purgatives, only aggravate
the disease. Chamberlain’s Tablets bring about
a natural action of the bowels, thus curing the
most obstinate case of constipation.*
The readiness of Australians to appreciate
a good thing is instanced by the sale of “ Bourn-

increase. It has no superior.*

SUFFERERS WITH
INDIGESTION
Should Know About the
Tonic Treatment.
The Principle is to Make the
Stomach Strong Enough to
Digest Food. Sydney Woman
Cured by this Method.
If you suffer with indigestion, what you need to
know is that the trouble is caused by the fact that
your stomach is not strong enough to digest ordi-
nary food properly. It will appeal to you that
the common-sense treatment is to make the
stomach stronger. Invalid foods, known as pre-
digested foods, which don’t bring the processes of
digestion into action, really cause further weak-
ness. Purgatives only hurry the food on, and
don’t cure. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, which are a
blood former and nerve tonic, aim at strength-
ening all the organs of the body. The fact that
anaemic people always suffer with indigestion
shows the intimate relation between the blood
supply and the digestive system. That’s why the
blood making qualities of Dr. Williams’Pink Pills
have cured indigestion in a common-sense way.
“Some time back I was attacked with indiges-
tion,” said Mrs. Wm. McMurdo, 5 Irving Street,
Chippendale, Sydney. “ I had to leave off taking
solid foods. I could only take milk food. After
eating a mere trifle, I’d get a dreadful burning
pain, just at the end of the breast bone. I had a
feeling as if I’d suffocate. I got thinner and
thinner and all the color left my face and lips. If
I walked quickly my heart thumped so that I’d
have to stop and rest. Often I couldn’t close my
eyes all night. I was terribly nervous. The
least sound made me jump and tremble. My
head ached and my sight got so weak and blurred
that I had to take to glasses. I went to the doc-
tor. He said I had indigestion, and gave me a
tonic, but I got no better. I was ailing like this
for about two years before I started Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. A lady friend found them so good
that she persuaded me to try them. The first box
did me g;ood. The third box found me taking a
little solid food and that burning pain in my chest
got less severe, and I didn’t feel so choked. My
heart didn’t thump so violently, and I wasn’t so
drowsy and weary. Soon I was able to eat well
and got some color into my face. Four boxes
completely cured me.”
When you ask for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
don’t be put off with anything else. Go where
you can get the genuine with Dr. Williams’ name
on the outside wrapper ; it’s the genuine that cures.
Price 2s. 9d. a box, or six boxes for 15s. 3d. ; to be

POLITICAL
POINTS
There is an agitation against the cabinet-
making Chow stirring in Melbourne again. All
the factory legislation leaves the sweated Mon-
golian and his boss in possession of the industry.
There is to be a public meeting, and Mr. Mauger
is to take the chair. Ten to one it will be a
Chinese chair.
It is worth noting that Sachse, M.L.C. of
Victoria, the man who recently attended a pro-
nigger meeting in Melbourne and declared that
white men couldn’t trash cane in the tropics, is
the same individual who altered the date of the
school holidays in a part of northern Victoria so
that the holidays and the fruit harvest would fall
together, and the kids, instead of having a spell,
might toil under a burning sun at gathering fruit.
And the temperature in these inland parts has
been known to knock spots off the records of
tropical Australia.
The 49J acres which comprise the grounds
on which Sydney’s Agricultural Show displays
itself are held under lease, but that does not
satisfy the showy committee-men. So they are
getting ready a Bill, .and will cadge Parliament to
make them a present of the fee simple. One
good result will probably follow the introduction
of the Bill. Parliament is sure to inquire whether
the Show is answering the purposes for which it
was originated and for which the State pays a
stiff annual subsidy. Fatty degeneration has been
long charged against it, and the disease grows
worse. What does this alleged Agricultural Show
do for agriculture ?
JOHN BULL'S NIGHTMARE.
“England must wake up,” was the keynote of the
speeches delivered at the Mansion House meeting.
“Boggabri” : I have heard a lot lately
about our “dear old home land,” etc., and about
being of one kin. Curiously enough, the people
that prate most loudly upon such subjects are just
the ones who regard their brethren and fellow-
subjects of Edward VII. who chance to live on the
southern side of the Murray as being foreigners of
the worst type, and only just a shade better than
Germans or Old Nick. Hindus, Sikhs, etc., are,
of course, quite properly regarded as brothers.
The inquiry into the condition of the
Addington (M.L.) railway workshops started with
a bogus charge of loafing directed against the men,
and ended in a real charge against those in power,
r or the sake of the Treasurer’s blessed “surplus”
the machinery has been allowed to keep run-
'nng, till “ obsolete” is a tame term for its
degeneracy. The chief machine in the
shops is called the big “ punch.”
This is driven by steam, and, when
it is going, all other machines
have to stop. There are shears
attached to this bit of lumber,
but when the shears are being
used the punch must re-
main idle—and vice vers't.
There is a steam roller
that will not take in
the plates for the big
boilers. There is an
overhead crane that
takes six strong
men to work it,
and two small,
crazy punching
machines with
shears attach-
ed, which a
decent manu-
facturer
would not
allow
board and
lodging
on his
Scrap
heap.
The hy-
draulic
riveter is
out of
date, and the
crane stand-
ing over it is
absolutely dan-
gerous. With
this obsolete para-
phernalia the men
have been working at
top speed for years in a
successful endeavor to keep ahead
of the demand for engines and rolling
stock. In Mr. Ronayne’s office, Hon. Ned
Jenkinson stigmatised this state of affairs as the
“Government stroke,” but he came downstairs
with a crash and a lot of disorganised friends at
the inquiry. The charge against the men has
fallen through. What about the charge against
the officers ? Echo answers “ What! ”
A few years ago the German wool-buyer
looked in on Australia occasionally; but it was
John Bull who was the reliable wholesale cus-
tomer. But J. Bull has stuck to his Freetrade,
while the German and the Frenchman practised
Protection and slammed their doors in the British
manufacturer’s face. So, to-day, of the wool sold
in the Sydney market, Bull takes barely 18 per
cent. In the season lately ended, Britain took
131,000 bales, while France took 225,000 and Ger-
many and Belgium 270,500 bales. The Belgian
business is, to a large extent, merely a branch of
the German trade ; but even knocking the Belgian
figures out,, Kaiser Bill called for 195,000 bales,
or just upon 50 per cent, more than John Bull
called for. Moreover, J. Bull, who isn’t sure of
his markets, never knows exactly how much he
does want; wherefore while the other two are
fairly steady buyers, Bull rushes in and out in an
erratic fashion. For instance, he stayed out in
the early part of the last season when prices were
low, and then burst in excitedly at the fag end of
the sales when prices were at their height. John
Bull’s Freetrade madness hits him in all sorts of
curious little ways, and this is one of them.
Affairs in Europe just now are to a great
extent a repetition of the affairs of some 33 years
ago. Old Abdul Hamid now fills the place that
young Abdul Hamid did then. The second
Turkish Parliament is tottering to its end
now; the first one was tottering then. The
Turkish reformers are fleeing for their lives now
just as their predecessors did in the ’7o’s. Servia
is cursing in the background now just as before;
Peter is king instead of Milan, but it is the same
futile old Servia. And Austria is hanging round
on the horizon waiting to intervene, and with its
eye on Salonica ; it was Russia that hung round
in previous days with its eye on Adrianople, but
it is the same olcj hang round. Also Macedonia
is howling for deliverance in the middle distance
in place of Bulgaria, but it is the same old howl
and for the same old reason.
Those “loyal” people who want, to drag
money together to help the Ma Country always
seem to regard the ill-paid public servant as a
fitting person from whom to cadge. Therefore,
it is quite in the natural order of things that the
impecunious bobby of N.S.W. should be invited,
by a circular from the superintendent, to give a
day’s pay towards the Dreadnought fund. In a
case of this sort the cadge should begin at the
top. In other words, if a majority of the mem-
bers of Parliament will give a day’s income—some
of them are fairly wealthy men, and get a lot of
money in a day—towards a Dreadnought, that
would clearly signify that they were in favor of
the movement. Then the public servant might
be approached. But it is a degrading business to
blackmail the hard-up employee for material cash
while his masters contribute only long speeches
and applause.
William Wilks, M.H.R., the N.S.W.
Foreign-trade Representative who has travelled
all his political life on the Orange Lodge ticket,
has been repeating the dreary old lie to the effect
that the Labor party is bossed by “Rome.” It
would be interesting to know the size of the
quarterly cheque which Wilks gets from Rome.
It ought to be a fairly large one. So long as he
dared, Wilks was a professed Freetrader—a man
who strove to destroy Australian industry, and
deprive the Australian Protestant workman of a
in order to make room in Protestant Australia
for the goods of the Roman Catholic workman of
France, Belgium, Spain, Austria, Italy, Bavaria,
etc. The really ingenious agent of Rome natu-
rally professes to be an Orangeman and a violent
Methodist local preacher in order to throw the
public off the scent. Hence the existence of such
Jesuitical characters as Wilks, Cook and others.
They would be sheer fools if they didn’t call them-
selves Orangemen.
“N.”: Somewhat bearing on the Dread-
nought row is a case in the history of the Cinque
Ports (England). About 300 years ago Rye fitted
out and manned a warship, which did well against
the Dutch. When it returned home, the men ex-
pected an enthusiastic reception.
Instead of that they were
received with contumely.
While they wete
away, Rve had
beensacked by
the Dutch.
THE IMPORTED ARTICLE.
Apropos the German band that was hired to perpetrate
“ God Save ” for Governor-General Dudley at the Sydney’
Zoo, and other matters.
FAT MAN (who has just subscribed to Dread-
nought fund): "Hooray, heresh Dago. Lesh
hire him t’ playsh (hie) ‘Rule Britannia.’”
If Australia really wants to sacrifice some-
thing for the empire, why not sacrifice its six
State Governors and the silly pomp thereof ? If
the ceremonial part of the State Governor indus-
try were wholly cut out, the business part could
be done by the Chief Justice (as Deputy under
the Governor-General), without any serious addi-
tion to his labors, and £5OO a year added to
his salary would be more than sufficient. On
that basis, it would be possible to save, in salaries
and expenses, considerably over £30,000 a year.
Then if Australia really must present Britain
with a Dreadnought, and must borrow (say)
£2,000,000 for the purpose, it could put this
£30,000 a year into a sinking fund, and thus pay
off the loan in about 35 years. It seems a fair
opportunity to sacrifice something—some pomp
and vanity and silly pride—for the sake of good
old Britain.
The plaint of a casual citizen :
During the height of its yell for a Dreadnought, the
Agk published, accidentally' no doubt, in its financial
column, a statement concerning the amount of money
invest' <1 by Great Britain abroad. It seems to be agreed
that the collective British Cohen has no less than
£3,500,000,000 out at interest all over the world. And
one of Bull’s largest creditors is Australia, which is sup-
posed to owe its parent—privately and publicly—tin
huge sum of £385,000,000. The interest alone on this
appalling debt is put down at about £10,000,000. With
these figures on our mind (they didn’t seem to be on the
Age's mind), the proposal to "borrow another £2,000,000
and give it back does indeed seem a quaint, inverted
form of insanity. Considering the splendid customers
we have been to Bull-Cohen, it is indeed about up to him
to give us a Dreadnought or two with which to start our
own navy.
Even Maoriland grows a little tired of the
way its hard-borrowing rulers cadge for titles at
the public cost. Joseph Ward’s offer of “a
Dreadnought, or two if necessary,” hasn’t excited
the unanimous enthusiasm that was expected. A
pro-Dreadnought meeting was held at Christ-
church with 4000 people present and two bishops
on the platform. It was mostly howl and smash
and flying chairs. The howl was so tremendous
that it was difficult to say what it was intended
to signify, but the people who dragged down the
Union Jack and jumped on it were obviously in
an unpleasant mood. According to an embittered
press, “the meeting degenerated into hysteria
and ended in chaos.”
A Victorian ex-rail way man writes :
The Argus has a special “ Railway Accident ” column
now. It is a dull day when the column has not two or
three happenings to record on Tait’s railways. One fatal
mishap the other day caused more than passing notice.
(Mishaps don’t .usually’cause more than passing notice;
they are too common.) A porter-ticket-collector-booking
clerk-platform-attendant youth, aged 18, was killed at
East Richmond while trying t o close carriage doors with
his feet while he collected tickets and registered parcels
and counted cash with his hands and answered
inquiries with his mouth. He may’ have been trying to do
two or three other simultaneous jobs. He was appar-
ently’ rushing about so quickly that nobody saw him
killed —in fact, he was dead half an hour before bis corpse
stopped rushing. His death stirred up some people to
write to the papers. The general opinion seems to be
that passengers should open and shut the carriage doors
themselves. Tait agrees with this. By-arid-by’e he will
suggest that the railway travellers should drive the trains
themselves, taking turns on the locomotive according to
their various stations.
But it is not altogether Tait’s fault. He was brought
to Victoria to make the railways pay, in response to a
demoniacal yell from Kyabram, and yet to carry’ lvya-
bram’s produce at absurdly low rates. The authors of
the Kyabram “Reform” movement are the real crimi-
nals. When two boys are put to do three men’s work,
and one man is given the duties of about four men,
things are sure to happen. But, of course, the real cul-
prits are not punished. The rank and file have to bear
the blame. Hence Station-master Kendall, late of Sun-
shine, is sacked, “with a recommendation to mercy.”
Engine-driver Milburn is sacked also, hut may’ appeal to
the Commissioners. The Commissioners may put Mil-
burn back on his job, and sack themselves, but they
won’t.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If the debts are taken over, it will most certainly’ (as
Mr. Fisher himself states) raise questions of great diffi-
culty, that is, if the States are deprived of their right to
borrow. _ This right the representatives of the States will
never give up. If the Commonwealth Government
attempts to take away the States’ independent right to
borrow, it will, I venture to say, lead to the fighting of
the fiercest battle that Australia has ever known.—Pre-
mier C. G. Wade, of N.S.W., in answer to Prime
Minister Fisher.
Ma has put up with much of late,
She has been jumped upon
So that her whilom oheeriness
And gaiety are gone.
Her old wire-netting steals have not
Come off. Each action she
Has brought against the Commonwealth
Has been “ bumped ” hopelessly.
She sees no brightness anywhere ;
Before her dark specks loom
Like Braddon Blots, and everything
Is dreariness and gloom.
Yet with it all she’s kept the peace.
Though choused of every “ Right *
She’s only wept and wept; alway
She has declined to fight.
But now a Trouble threatens which
Puts all else in the shade.
The dearest privilege she owns—
The joy’ of Mister Wade —
Is menaced with extinction. If
The worst befall, and IT
Is reft from her, ah ! then no ord-
inary crying fib
Will meet the case. No ! She’ll arise
With a wild baresark glare,
And arm herself, and run amok,
And call for teeth and hair.
Gore will run ankle-deep a-down
The thoroughfare of King ;
And George and Pitt will yell and stab
And slay like anything.
Take heed of this : A State will stand
A lot, but try 7 to take
Its right to pawn itself, and nought
But Blood its rage will slake.

Motor Boat Enthusiasts.— ln last week’s
Bulletin (this page) I noticed the probability of several
large racing engines being imported. During a recent
visit to Sydney I was astonished to learn that only about
5 per cent, of marine motors used about tbe harbor city
were of Australian manufacture. A number of Sydneyites
were greatly surprised when informed that in Queensland
70 to 80 per cent, of the engines used were made in Bris-
bane by one maker alone, his works having turned out
over 120 motors for boats. These engines are second to
none (and superior to most) in the world, and when same
can be purchased at a little lest cost than the best im-
portations, it is hard to understand the motive of Aus-
tralians in passing them over for (probably) an inferior
machine. The engines are built of the highest grade
material of the 4-cycle type, and constructed for the
heaviest duty or speed boats, up to, practically, any
power. For full information, apply F. Berry, Wilson

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Concerning the recent A.J.C. meeting:—Finan-
cially the venture Was a booming success (for the club,
bookmakers and such like fry), and far ahead of any pre-
vious Autumn meeting. The small contingent of Vic-
torian nags did better than usual, and got away with
£5360 of the £20,184 that was distributed. The princi-
pal winners were the owners of Trafalgar, Messrs. P. and
VV. Mitchell, whose little swag of winnings totted up to
£4257 as the result of their horse’s triumphs in Autumn
Stakes, Sydney Cup and A.J.C. Plate, and second place
in Cumberland Stakes. N. S. Wales retains £14,6040f the
prize money.
* * * »
Five of the eleven in the book (including four
Victorians) started in the A.J.C. second steeple on Satur-
day, for which £4OO had been allocated. But several of
those that did start were obviously out only for exercise.
Much money came for Kuala Lumpur, till six to four was
the best price—this after fluctuations in which two to one
was the top figure. It was a one-horse event, and
the horse with the Malay name, after jumping
beautifully, just cantered home 50 lengths to the
good. Winner’s fellow- Victorian, Lyrst, went out
and made the pace in a suicidal fashion over two miles,
and then cracked right up to finish third, because
nothing else was left. The only local gee-gee, Thelma
Dishvvood, made a bold bid over 2J miles, and then came
such a cropper that she had to be destroyed. Saverne,
which beat Kuala Lumpur the previous Monday, flopped
at the same fence that brought Thelma Dashwood down
five furlongs from home. K.L. won the two ’chases at
last year's A.J.C. Autumn meet, and finished alone in the
second event. He was ridden on both occasions by
J. Smith, who also had the mount on Saturday.
If punters will lay odds, or even money, on a
favorite, they had better confine their sanguine ventures
to the jumping races. With all the chances of a blunder
thrown in, the hot-pots are less likely to boil over across
the sticks than on the flat. The third day of the A.J.C.
Autumn meeting v-as disastrous to plungers in three
cases. They laid 5t04 on Parsee for the All Aged Stakes,
and he was beaten out of a place ; the odds of 10 to 9 on
Trafalgar for the Cumberland Stakes were upset, prob-
ably by the interference of Lord Nolan, the three runners
getting absurdly- jammed together; and again Didus,
backed down to 7 to 4 for the City Handicap, failed to get
a place. But Yarrabundie, a6to 4 favorite for the Hurdle
Race, won by four lengths. On the second day, the two
shortest-priced favorites —Irishman (2 tolagainst)andFive
Crown (6 to 4 against)—were beaten very easily.
Trafalgar’s performances at the Sydney Cup
meeting have revived the question as to why this ap-
proved stayer was ignominiously beaten in the V.R.C.
Leger, six w-eeks previously-. But, after all, the son of
Wallace is only one among a dozen gees that have lately-
been demonstrating the glorious uncertainty of the
Turf w-ith striking ability.
Even the oldest Sydneyite can remember no
A.J.C. meeting so disastrous to the fool backer of the
equine fraud as that which ended on Saturday last. The
habit of betting on the nod is growing in Sydney-, and the
wail of Patrick Moses is loud and vociferous because many
backers have had to ask for time to pay up. Excepting
those who mix it—punt as well as lay the odds —the
Christian Israelites have come out with heavier bags than
ever before. Picking winners of handicaps was an im-
possibility, and the spotting of w.f.a. winners a thing that
never happened. It is the w.f.a. race that the backer
usually relies on to pay his losses in the handicap
division. This time he lost on both. Some of the book-
makers were so elated with their winnings on the first
and second days that they closed up for the remainder of
the meeting, and. resolutely declined to give punters any
chance of revenge. Possibly Lord Nolan proved the
biggest gold mine to the pencillers, as there was a rush to
recover through him in each of his last two races—and
each time the frail punter went down.
Montcalm's winning of the All-Aged Stakes
was a crusher to the punting brotherhood. Odds at 5 to
4 were laid on Parsee ; and Doncaster-winner Hyman,
and Maltine, Virtu, and Artilleri • were all more or less
fancied. But Moses roared, howled and shouted
hundreds to three on Montcalm right up to the rise of
the barrier without i nducing business. Montcalm got away
badly, and was quite out of the hunt for some time ; but,
coming with a bullet-like rush at the finish, he just
pipped Hy-man on the post in lmin. 37fsec., the fastest
time by a quarter of a second ever put up in Australasia.
Maltine was third and Parsee next, the whole four being
bunched, with only- heads between them. The foolish-
ness of the game was never better exemplified than in the
case of Montcalm, backed for sirtftll fortunes in the Don-
caster Mile Handicap, in which he ran ninth—a long way
behind the horse he beat on Wednesday. Possibly the
weight of money affects a horse just as much as the
weight of the jockey. In that case, it certainly- seems
that as the coin goes "on some of the jockey ought to come
off.
* * * *
Cumberland Stakes (two miles) was another
disastrous race for the public. Only three started,
Neith on the rails, Trafalgar in the centre, and Lord
Nolan on the outside. They were locked together till
almost abreast the winning iine, when Lord Nolan shot
out his head. This was when the bum'ping took place,
and Trafalgar was forced to the rear by Lord Nolan within
a few strides of home. Having disposed of Trafalgar, the
Melbourne Gup winner paid some little attention to
Neith, whose people promptly protested, with the result
that Lord Nolan was disqualified. The crowd was not
sorry to see the Lord bumped out by the officials, as his
owner’s tactics had made him unpopular—except with
the people who had hoped to recover by him, of course.
* * « *
The A.J.C. Plate on Saturday last was a regular
inter-State affair, in which Trafalgar represented Vic-
toria; Black Prince, Queensland ; and Lord Nolan, Vava-
sour and Neith ran for N. S. Wales. Odds at two to one,
and then six to four were laid on Lord Nolan, with threes
Trafalgar and twelves Neith. Trafalgar practically- won
from end to end,.with Neith 2£ lengths away, and Lord
Nolan the same distance in the tail of the scheme. The
tiuve—smin. 44Jsee. —was but Jsee. better than the hard-
and-fast figures which had to be beaten to secure the full
prize instead of only half the first, second and third
prizes. Trafalgar in all four races showed rare grit.
Neith’s staying power in both the Plate and the Cumber-
land Stakes astonished the onlookers, who marvelled that,
the mare wasn’t bottled up for some of the big handicaps
of the Spring meeting. Bottling-up is regarded as quite
legitimate nowadays.

Jockey Mackenzie went close to putting up a
record at Lismore (N.S.W.) last week. It was a two
days’ meeting, in which Mack had no less than 10 mounts.
He won eight and was a close second in toe other
two. This sort of thing is magnificent, but it is rough on
the other jockeys of the meeting.

Some figures about the Oakhank race-meeting,
which attracts all Adelaide into the hills on Easter Mon-
day, and then goes to sleep for another twelvemonth.
Seven jumps each round ; full course, three rounds ; two
of the jumps, 4ft. 3im, and three of them 4ft. There
were 25,000 people present this year, and £27,000 went
through the totalisator; club takes Is. (id. in the £ of
this, and S.A. Government 6d. in the £. Stake money
for the day, £2450 loot) of it for the Great Eastern
Steeplechase. Best dividends :£7 Is. on the winner of
the Hills Railway Stakes, and £ll 10s. on the second in
the same race (ten starters). But the best example of
the “machine’s” benevolence was seetl in an amateur
steeplechase, where the warm favorite was pipped on toe
post, and his supporters still got 18s. back for their sove-
reign. The man with the big has not yet been sus-
pected of betting on those terms.

The bitterness of it. Rank outsiders Hyman
(Doncaster, Saturday) and Haco (Flying Handicap, Mon-
day), to whom in each instance red-hot favorite Irishman
ran second, were bred by the latter’s present owner, and
all three are by the same sire.

The success of crack jockey W. H. Smith in the
Final Handicap, Saturday, prompted lots of people to
spec, a bit on his mount, Biw Bee, despite that he is re-
tained by that animal’s stable, and was compelled to ride
the nag whether he liked it or not. And yet race-going
people are often laughed at for their unshiftable belief in
“ offices” and that unexplainable influence—luck.
* # * *
Melbourne Age, in a burst of plain-speaking,
remarked the other day: “The modern man takes a
rational pride in the standard of cleanliness he has estab-
lished in his home ; yet up till now' he has been seemingly
content, as soon as he goes out into the street, to con-
sume any amount of dried horse-dung.” But why should
the animal matter in question remain at large in the
streets until it be dried ? There is just now circulating
in Melbourne—as the Age should know—a pictorial joke
which touches the matter aforesaid. The joke is coarse,
but the moral of it is excellent, and every young Aus-
tralian ought to take, it, to heart. A sealed
envelope bears the tempting inscription : “ How to make
money by following horses. By one-who has made heaps.”
You break the envelope, expecting to find a turf-tipster’s
advt., but discover a picture-postcard. The picture
shows a horseman riding along a country road, whilst a
small boy is gathering up, with hand-broom and pan, the
marketable produce which the quadruped has just given
to the vvorld. Thus are we shown “how to make money
by following horses, by one who has made heaps.”
* * * *
The Victorian bowlers (M.C.C. team) got beaten
in Adelaide at Easter. But in a single-handed event
which followed, E. M. Pascoe and the veteran O. T. Smith,
both visitors, had the finish to themselves. An interest-
ing point about it was that Olem Hill got into the semi-
final. He had not, up to then, been regarded seriously as
a bowls-player. But then he never is regarded seriously
as anything but a batsman, until he comes out and wins
prizes, as he has already done at tennis, hurdle-racing,
and billiards.
■* * * *
Mourn, bowlers ! Weep, Waverley ! Howl,
Mosman ! and rend your garments, oh City ! For the
Wood-Macleod trophy is now in the hands of the
Victorians, who outgener died the N. S. Wales crowd
badly on their own greens. In the first match Victoria
wm' by one point; the second fell to N.S. W. with a
margin of 14 ; but the third was again won by Victoria
with six points to spare. So, althobgh the Walers scored
the most points, the Victorians scored the most games ;
and the Ma State had to hand over the prize.
The Y. M.C.A. (Sydney) Marathon race, over a
distance of 26 miles 385yds., didn’t bring much glory, and
left less behind it. The event was contested over roads
around Sydney (which only escaped being.dusty and dirty
through a welcome shower of rain); and was followed by
amass of humanity in every means of conveyance. The
result was a win for A. R. Sime, who got
over the distance in 3hr. smin. 30 l-ssecs. The
pitiable sight of A. Wood, who finished second
nearly Bmin. later, and ran himself well-nigh
blind, and collapsed at the finish, made the big attend-
ance cheer as if it were at a bull-fight. Of the 31 who
started, 20 struggled through—the last man being
lhr. 39min. behind the winner. Tiie picture of the dis-
tressed falling down along the roadside was wholly un-
pleasant, and the Y. M.C.A. should be arrested for en-
couraging cruelty to animals.
Like the cricketers who “ take on” baseball to
keep themselves in form through the winter, Victoria’s
crack swimmer, Beaurepaire, and his club mate, Clar-
ingbold, have joined the Leopold football club, a South-
Port junior combination, and will bog in for the good
of their health till the weather and water get warmer.
The Leopolds used formerly to play on the muddy
waste block nicknamed Paradise, where Melbourne’s
temporary Stadium was, and if th“ barraekers haven’t
forgotten their customs or remembered their manners,
Bogey is in for some strenuous afternoons.

Baseball is threatening to boom in Sydney, and
to claw at the money bags of the footballers for i he cash
of that section of the people that take exercise by deputy.
The revival dates back to the visit of the Yankee Fleet,
which brought much joy and a little cash—to wit, £s3
to the Baseball Association. The result of tliis bloated
profit is that the Association not only starts with a
clean sheet, but with £B5 in the hinder receptacle of
its tail coat. This unparalleled state of affairs has
caused the baseball head to swell, and the Association
is now talking of buying up grounds and securing
options over others.

The motor boat ocean race from Sydney to
Newcastle and back, which the N.S.W. club indulged in
recently, was far from being a success. Only- two of the
five starters managed to complete the run, and they were
considerably knocked about. The truth of the matter is
that a special type of boat is required for ocean-racing,
and in this climate it is not a comfortable boat. And with
such a splendid expanse of water for inside boating, men
are not likely to build ocean-going cruisers, and sacrifice
joy and comfort merely for the glory of making ocean
trips—especially when the glory is attended with so much
discomfort and risk.
A.s a disgraceful, downright dog-walloping the
defeat inflict®! by sculler Whelcta on Fogwcll at■ Akaroa
(Ma inland) would be hard to equal. It is difficult to find
a parallel for the unholy “doing” Fogwell received, and
this crusoing d feat should convince him that he is not
composed of the stuff of which champions are made
Wheleh allowed him to get to t e front and lead hj ab ut
a length from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and a half.
Then Wheleh Lhrew off the mask, rushed through the
water, overtook Fogwell, and left him standing
Fo'nvell’s spurt was a dismal failure, and as if recognising
the' fact, he quietly sat up. Then with a sudden frenzy
he set to work' again, and made a dreary exhibition
against the streaking Maorilander, who beat him by about
20 lengths. *

The Dunlop Relay Despatch Ride turned out a
booming success, and the 128 cyclists who took part, in
the affair rode so hard nd maintained such a steady pace
that the despatch was delivered in Sydney 3hr. 25uini-
inside schedule rime. Yet, in fixing the schedule, Harry
James, who manages these things for the Dunlop B ibber
Co. was somewhat grudging in his allowance for some of
the difficult stretches, and worked out his whole table on
the assumption that the men would have favorable con-
ditions right through from Adelaide to Sydney. And
favorable conditions do not generally continue over 1140
mile of continent. The time allowed by James was 16 hr.
Toe cyclists cut it down to 69hr. 35;inn. Prom the
moment the wheelers entered Victoria they began to chip
scraps off the schedule, and finally lopped 3lir. 25nnn. off
it altogether. . _(
For people who take an interest in analysis it
may hi noted that the riding time from Adelaide to Mel-
bourne was 34hrs. Sflinin. for 570 miles, while it was
34hrs. 39miu. for the 575 miles between Melbourne and
Svdney. The fastest sustained run was from Melbourne
to Albury, 201 miles, which were covered in 9hrs. 44mm.
During the first 24 hours 375 miles were covered, and 405
miles in the second 24—an average of 19 miles per hour.
Which is excellent going. #
Vic. League of Wheelmen doesn’t exactly know
whether it is dead or not, and has therefore appointed a
committee “ to devise means for increasing the revenue

locate where the League stands, the lost body should

Victorian cyclists E. A. Pye, P. Hehir, and
H. VV. Nesbitt'left Australia last week for a season’s
racing on the saucer tracks at Salt bake City, each being
armed with pleasant-looking engagements. The departed
trinitv, however, left in a bad humor over the action of
the N.S.W. League of Wheelmen officials in fining them
at the Good Friday race-meeting in Sydney, and are
threatening stinking fish talk.

N.S.W. cyclist A. H. Shepherd, clinging closer
than a brother to motorist De Fraga, broke through the
Australasian Mile Standing Start record at Sydney Sports
Ground last week. D>n Walker was the previous chain-
pion, but his lmin. 45sec. has had a whole lOsec. hacked
off it by the latest aspirant. The new record also cracks
the British professional record of lmin. SSsec., and misses
by only 4 3-ssec. the world's record. After covering him-
self with glory. Shepherd rolled off his machine and an-
nounced his retirement’ from the cycle path altogether.
Whether lie saw things during that wild rush round the
track is not stated; but the .usual end of ihe record-
sin isher being to be himself smashed, Shepherd’s retire-
ment is a monument to his good sense. Record-breaking
is all very fine, but it is hard to see what good it does
anybody.

In all human probability before the end of the
present season, hockey will have been established on an
all-Australian basis, with a Federal council controlling
the sport in its inter-State phases. The game is booming.
It is. being played enthusiastically by both sexes ; and
the hockey girl", in her smart costume, with tlie glow of
health in her cheeks and the light of battle in her dark
brown eye, is a creature of beauty and a joy forever-
lasting. The States which are expected to form the
association are N. S. Wales, Victoria, South Australia and
Westralia.

Sydney Rugby Union teams finished their
practice matches last week, and will commence serious
business on Saturday next. The First Grade competition
will open with matches between South Sydney and
University, North Sydney and Sydney, Western Suburbs
and St. George, Newtown and Manly, Glebe and Eastern
Suburbs, while Balmain draws the bye, and thereby is
sure of two points at least.
•K * * *
The League crowd also starts its competition on
Saturday next, and will have four first-grade matches
raging in and around Sydney. The combatants will be
Balmain and South Sydney, Eastern Suburbs and Glebe,
North Sydney and Newcastle, Newtown and Western
Suburbs. The reform of the League appears to have in-
stilled fresh vigor into the footballers, and some good play
can be looked for during the coming season. The com-
mittee has impressed upon players that the future exist-
ence of the League depends upon making the game
attractive to the public during this winter, and the
players mean to “bog in.”

Rugby Union football in Bananaland had a bad
time last season. Tiie year began with a credit
balance of just over £lOOO ; and, when the year ended, the
Q.R.U. could only find £92. All the important engage-
ments of the season brought financial disaster ; and the
Q.R.U. is pondering over a way to get out of the ditch
which seems ahead.

The Soccer footballers started the Rawson Cup
competition in Sydney on Saturday last in weather made
specially to order. The players had evidently be. n prac-
tising hard, as all the games were closely and strenuously
contested, and all ended in a draw. The opening was
marred by an unfortunate accident whereby J. Dick, the
Newtown full-back, broke his leg. The team from the
Powerful drew with Sydney, the figures being two each ;
Balmain and Glebe scored one goal each, and Granville
and Newtown made a pair on either side. Western
Suburbs was unable to get its team into the field, and
forfeited to Pyrmont.

A number of alleged gentlemen who suspect
themselves of being “ sports ” congregated at the Mel-
bourne Gun Club’s ground last Saturday for the slaughter
of wr tehed sparrows, starlings and pigeons. Most of
these assassins of helpless little birds crawl into print
under cover of aliases; but not so A. E. Smith —
unless Smith itself can be considered as good as an
alias. This individual had the hide to win a
trophy for sparroweide under his own brazen cog-
nomen. Apparently these followers of a con-
temptible and degenerate pastime committed an un-
usual number of acts of callous cruelty on the
defenceless fowl, for Melbourne Agk remarks that the
afternoon’s “sport” was most enjoyable. It is time
that the Law investigated these bird-murdering clubs.
Their meetings are gambling carnivals, pure and simple,
and betting which is supposed to be illegal, except on
a racecourse, is rife at them. Also the men who take
part in them should be put under medical treatment.

N.S.W. Cricket Ass. is out on the warpath
against the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust. The grabbing
policy of the Trust is sending the snorting bodies on the
rooks, and, as a result, the N.S.W.C.A. is negotiating
with the trustees of all the enclosed grounds in the
Sydney Metropolitan district for terms for the inter-State
matches next season. If the policy were followed by
other sporting organisations, the Sydney Cricket Ground
Trustees would possibly find that their property had sud-
denly turned into an animal —to wit, one white elephant:
Concerning boxer Britt and his Yankee methods
the London Referee says:—“ Britt is g ing to Australia,
and one wonders what sort of referees are grown in that
part of the world ? If they are of the variety who permit
a boxer to prevent his opponent from using his most
effective weapon, Britt ought to do well. Summer’s left,
when he was free to employ it, was constantly in Britt’s
face, repeatedly sending his head back with a jolt; but
Britt bored in, held the dangerous implement fast to his
side, and jabbed his man with his own left... Refereeing
is no light job when you have a persistent holder like
Britt to deal with, for if he had been allowed his way
Summer’s left arm would have been clutched tightly to
the American’s side throughout the entire affair. We
are told that this is allowed—and, indeed, approved—in
the States, but it is not allowed and is strongly disap-
proved in England,”
Judging from this, The Bulletin assumes that
Britt and Tahtnmy Burns would be admirably matched.
Their fighting would be mainly a struggle for possession
of the other fellow’s left arm. The one who scored first
clutch would be able to get in a jab or two before his own
left arm was captured. Then they would stand linked
together, each holding the other one’s left arm, until the
three minutes had expired. And so on. The method,
which is quite permissible in ’Murka and quite otherwise
in Britain, is the method the champion Tahmmy Burns in-
troduced to Australia, and which the referees legalised
because they had no option in the matter. Tahmmy was
practically running the show. In fact he was the show.
When he “ fought ” Lang in Melbourne, the referee
simply represented the management, and all he did was
to shake a finger at Tahmmy when that violent autocrat
had savagely jabbed Lang after the latter had broken
away under the referee’s directions. It was this Yankee
jabbing, crouching, clutching system of fighting which
Jack Johnson made to look so ugly by standing up to his
opponent and giving him a straight left and right when
the chance offered.
“Wormwood”: Grafton (N.S.W.) is
about to hold a municipal jubilee, and the Lord
knows what cause it has for jubilation. Here is
the city of Grafton —be careful about the “city”
—with 50 miles of. streets, not one yard of which
is tit to be driven over with a decent cart; no
sewerage system ; a tinpot supply of undrinkable
water ; reticulation restricted to part of onestreet
only; and street lighting just sufficient to make
darkness visible. About a year ago the council
connived at the alienation of half of the park by
the Agricultural Society (nearly all the members
of the then council were also members of the
society), and now we are likely to have the North
Coast line run through the other half of the park,
cutting the Oval in twain. Still the council
makes no move. Notwithstanding all these
advantages obtained by a hardworking council,
Grafton is going to hold a jubilee, and have free
drinks and tucker for the anointed.
Some strangely scrappy biography by
“ Parson Adams ” (the parson has a reckless ten-
dency towards capital letters, and it doesn’t seem
worth while taking them out: —
Dr. Marshall Lang, father of the new Archbishop of
York, was Pastor of the Oollins-street Scots Church,
Melbourne, for several months, after the embroglio over
Dr. Strong and Chief Justice Higinbotham. Strong lost
the billet, chieflv at the instigation of Rentoul and
Pastor M’Eachran, through obstinately endorsing a free-
thought lecture by Higinbotham at the Church. Rentoul
and Strong have since becortie chums in their joint resist-
ance to the Boer War. Marshall Lang succeeded Norman
Macleod at the Barony Church, Glasgow, immortalised
by Scott in “ Rob Roy.” Now he is Principal
of Aberdeen University, where he did the honors
for Vic. Chief Justice' Madden. Proceed next to
his meteoric son, Dr. Cosmo Gordon Lang, Arch-
bishop of York, at the apparently unprecedented
juvenility of 44. First education at Park School, Glas-
gow. Then to King’s College, Cambridge, for a brief
p riod, and to Balliol College, Oxford, for a full time.
President of Union Debating Society. Shone in the
Dramatic Club. Studied for the Bar, at the Inner Temple,
London. Gave University Extension Lectures. Thus
engaged between 1883-9. Only then resolved to enter the
Church. Much influenced by Gore and Scott-Holland.
Confirmed by Bishop of Lincoln. Went to Cuddesdon
Theological College, Oxford. Ordained by Bishop Stubbs
(1890). Very successful as Curate in Leeds, Next
became a Fellow of Magdalen, Dean of Divinity,
and Incumbent of University Church, Oxford. Then
he took another plunge, as Vicar of Portsea, the great
Portsmouth suburb. Here he looked after 40,000 popu-
lation, with eight clergy, whose number he increased to
14. He came under Queen Victoria’s eye. She made him
one of her chaplains, and he preached at Osborne.
Remained single. Says Victoria to him one day : “Dr.
Lang, you must dismiss one of your curates, and take a
wife.” “Ah, but,” says Lang, “I should not be able
to dismiss Her.” He was accustomed to draw crowds
of 2000 at St. Mary’s, Portsea. Appointed Canon
of St. Paul’s, London, and Bishop Suffragan of
Stepney, in succession to the first one, Ingram,
made Bishop of London. Now it is leapfrog, Lang
over Ingram. However, each gets £lO,OOO a year.
“ Stay your stomach with that reflection,” says Asquith
to Ingram, like Hardcastle to Diggor.v in “She Stoops to
Conquer.” “ Aye, ’’ says Diggory, “I’ll stay my stomach
wi’ a slice o’ cold meat in the pantry.” Despite the mag-
nificent pantry of £2OO a week, Bishop Ingram, a single
man who lives like a Trappist monk, declares that he can
hardly make ends meet. Will Ingram and Lang be like
Dean Donaghy (Catholic) in Melbourne? He left Two
Pence, only enough for some Good Samaritanism he had
overlooked.
WORMS IN CHILDREN.
A VERY PREVALENT COMTLAINT.
In very young children much of the irritation
and fretfuiness is often due to the presence of
worms. Restlessness, fitfulness, sudden starts
and wetting the bed during sleep, hardness and
fulness of the belly, irregular movements of the
bowels, excessive secretions of saliva from the
mouth, are invariably indications of the irritation
caused by worms.
In older children the same symptoms are pre-
sent, but more distinctly defined. Grinding of
the teeth, violent movements of the legs and arms,
an undue flow of saliva which causes frequent
efforts to swallow. The bowels are irregular.
The breath is usually foul, and the child is lan-
guid and peevish. The tongue preternaturally
red or alternately red, and covered with a white
slimy mucus. A short, dry cough, emaciation,
slow fever, irregular pulse, and sometimes cqn-
vulsiotis. Loss of appetite frequently alternates
with a craving for food. Indeed, the latter symp-
tom is most pronounced in maty cases, and many
mothers have experienced the insatiable appetites
of their children without realising the cause.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
contain specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the stomach or
bowels, and do not weaken the system. They are
prepared in the form of a confection or lolly,
having no disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them as they
would an ordinary lozenge. Obtainable at all
chemists and stores. Price Is. 6d. (6 boxes Bs. 6d.),

•SA-VO-LA* in a few words is best described
as “the Greatest Skin Healer of the Century.”
All medical experts declare the great skin salve, SA-VO-LA to be the most
reliable of skin doctors, and invaluable to all persons in every grade of life
wherever accidents may happen. It is a disinfectant, antidote to blood poison,
and a skin-healer combined. It prevents blood poison arising from sores,
wounds, cuts, abrasions, etc., by reducing heat and inflammation and leaving
the injured parts soft, sweet, and cool. Workers in factories, warehouses,
or on farms, cattle-sheds, sheep-stations, mining camps or shearing sheds,
should have SA-VO-LA always handy, because it heals magically.
SA-VO-LA IS THE POCKET SKIN DOCTOR FOR ALL SKIN ILLS.
a ? ure cure for cuts, sores (chronic or acute), barcoo, rash, itch, burns, scalds, festers,
chilblains, sun-burns, pimples, eczema, skin-cracks, whitlow, scalp sores in children, ulcers, piles,
muscular rheumatism, lumbago, boils, nerve pains, chapped hands, etc.
For Piles it is a most remarkable cure, and, when applied to the part, should be slightly heated to
reduce the balm to a liquid, then saturate a piece of cotton wool, or some other soft material, and
apply. Stubborn cases have been cured in this way.
SA-VO-LA may be obtained of all chemists and grocers, price 1/6 the pot, or 3/6 large size,
containing four times the quantity. If not supplied locally, send direct for a pot, post free on
receipt of price.

There is a lesson to Australia in the
hysterical apprehension with which Britain
regards Germany’s growth as a naval power. Less
than 30 years ago Germany was in the habit of
buying its warships from Britain, and when it
built its first battleship in its own dockyards Bull
fell heavily into an outburst of merriment on
the subject. The Kaiser was depicted in cartoons
meant to be humorous as a small boy with one
solitary toy-vessel attached to a piece of string,
whilst at the back of J. Bull the fleet stretched
away over the horizon, and the shipyards were
full of new keels. At that time to the conserva-
tive British mind, with its rooted idea that
what is not. or is only just beginning, can
never be, Germany’s ship-building was an
amusing lunacy, and, because Germany was
trying to build its own ships when it
could get them cheaper by buying in
England, the Kaiser’s country was (so English
papers laboriously explained), commercially speak-
ing, an idiot. Australia has heard such a lot
about the folly of starting things, and the futility
of doing things, and the advisability of buying in
the cheapest foreign market instead of making
things, that the uprising of Germany seems to
embody some kind of a lesson. For everything
that we are told about the impossibility of doing
things for ourselves was also told to the Germans
within the memory of men now living—and not
old men, either. Likewise, it was told to the
United States within the memory of men still
living—and comparatively young men at that.

Mr. Thomas Forsyth, of Ashfield, writes and declares on oath the following I suffered from
acute inflammation of the stomach, with a burning pain. My tongue got a thick coating over it, and I
constantly suffered from nausea. Why, I used to be almost constantly vonnl l n g. I eonsu 1 ted two
doctors at Ashfield for years without getting relief. But in three weeks FIbHERb 1 HOb-

been in the Lodge for 18 years. Most of the members
know of my illness. Five to ten drops of FISHER b

FISHER & CO., Chemists, 337 George Street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs,—l feel it right to let you know at the earliest moment that since taking your
PHOSPHERINE, beginning about six weeks ago, I have been completely cured of a most violent
form of Indigestion. Previous to hearing of your splendid remedy I had been taking buckets of slush
of one kind and another, and all to no purpose—but FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE has hit the
bullseye, and now I can eat anything night or day.
I am very grateful to the friend who recommended it, and trust many other sufferers will find the
same relief that I have found from using it.
Yours faithfully,
UNSOLICITED AND CONCLUSIVE TESTIMONIAL.
The above testimonial is sent by a prominent commercial gentleman. Mr. Dirnant, after sending
the above testimonial, paid a visit to Sydney, and, calling upon Fisher & Co. stated that one day he
told a friend —a Scotchman —of his terrible sufferings from Indigestion. The friend said, liy
Fisher’s Phospherine,” and actually sold him a spare bottle for one shilling. Mr. Dirnant said it was
the best-spent shilling of his life.
Five to ten drops of FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE in water after meals is the greatest aid to
digestion known. The after-effects of over-eating and excess of drinking are removed by this Famous
Tonic. Ten drops in water half an hour before breakfast removes a sour taste from the mouth, and
makes the breath sweet and pleasant.

Pure Herbal
important Analysis,

Messrs. H. E. KUGELMANN & CO., 199 Clarence Street, Sydney.
Gentlemen,— ! have made a careful analysis of a sample of “ Kugelmann’s Pure Herbal Skin Soap,” which I find to be composed of vegetable
oils and fats, saponified with pure alkali. It contains no free alkali, nor any substance deleterious to the most delicate skin. The perfume and color are
both of natural and harmless plant origin, neither having any trace of animal or poisonous materials. Having powerful but non.poisonous antiseptics
thoroughly incorporated in the process of manufacture, this soap possesses heaiing properties which will remove diseases of the skin and restore it to a
he-lthy condition. It is a beautifully finished article, comparing favorably with similar imported soaps, and if used regularly as an adjunct of the
toilet, it will assist in keeping the body in health, and will have a pleasing, soothing effect on the skin. Yours faithfully

ACME OF PERFECTION,
AS a SKIN FOOD, SHAVING SOAP and
TOILET PREPARATION, KUGEL-
MANN’S PURE HERBAL SKIN
SOAP is fast achieving a position before
all others as the Soap for special treatment for the
complexion and skin, as well as for medical,
hygienic, shaving and general toilet purposes.
The main reason for this unique assumption of
public favor is that KUGELMANN’S HERBAL
SKIN SOAP is not merely an article of ordinary
commercial manufacture, but is carefully pre-
pared under the direction and from the prescrip-
tion of Australia’s Leading Consulting Herbal
Practitioner, so as to really constitute a part of
his treatment. In short, two great principles
form the solid base of this Herbal Soap :
1. That ABSOLUTE PURITY is essential in
any article of constant application to that delicate,
vital organ, the Skin.
2. That soap affords one of the readiest mediums
for the medical treatment of the human body.
The HERBAL SKIN SOAP in its present
form represents the fruit of nearly forty years’
experience in the use and prescription of beneficent
herbs for the cure of Australian maladies, and,
therefore, is better adapted to the climatic and
other conditions of Australian life than any
imported soap.
For the Prevention of Redness and Skin Irrita-
tion of all kinds, the cure of Eczema, Tetter,
Ringworm, Shingles, Blotches, Pimples and
Freckles; the prevention and cure of Dandruff,
fostering a stimulating effect upon the growth of
the Hair, stopping falling-out, inducing growth,
and making it soft and glossy. As a dentifrice, it
arrests decay and produces a dazzling brilliance.
For Shaving, is of Unique Benefit, owing to its
production of a rich, lasting and creamy lather, and
the exercise of soothing and hygienic functions
upon the skin.
In the nursery its beneficent : effects upon the
tender skin of infancy obviates the use of powder,
etc., the child’s skin being always kept cool and
smooth by its use.
“ Beauty’s Aid ” is the well-earned title of this
Herbal Skin Soap, because, in a healthy and per-
manent manner, it enhances natural beauties as
no mere nostrum can ever hope to do. In every
department of the toilet, and for every medicinal
unhygienic purpose for which soap can be used,
this soap has proved superior to any other Soap.
The Greatness of the Herbal Skin Soap‘is-the
greatness of Nature. It is a rare combination of
natural organic remedies culled from the grand
and simple provision of Mother Earth, whose
vegetable kingdom contains in abundance the only
medicines suited for assimilation by mankind.
The great appreciation of Kugelmann’s pure
Herbal Skin Soap is indicated by the following
selection of testimonials, which are ■ portion of those
we are daily receiving from, every part of Australia :
TENDER SKINS OF CHILDREN.
O’Connell Street, West End,
Brisbane, Q., 2Gth April, 1902.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —I write to let you know that my
wife considers your Herbal Skin Soap to be the
best obtainable. She has found it particularly
good for the skin, and especially suitable for the
tender skin of children. I myself use it for shav-
ing, and find it prevents all roughness and sore-
ness.—Yours very truly,
(Signed) WALTER -T. ADEY.
Witness: J. Pearce, of Trouton’s Pharmacy.
A LOVELY COMPLEXION.
92 Shafton Road, Kangaroo Point, '
Brisbane, 17th February, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne.
Dear Sir, —I like Kugelmann’s Herbal Skin
Soap owing to its keeping my completion free
from blemishes, freckles and sunburn. If I get
sunburned in the course of the day, I find your
Herbal Skin Soap will take it quite away by
morning. If I run out of your soap, my com-
plexion soon begins to look blotchy and dis-
colored. I can soon get it right again, though,
by using plenty of your Skin Soap.
(Signed) BEATRICE BROWN.
SOFTENS THE SKIN, CURES PRICKLY
HEAT.
Lavinia House, Upper Roma Street,
Brisbane, Q., 24th April, 1902.
Messrs, H. E. Kugelmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —Perhaps you will be pleased to
learn that I consider your Herbal Skin Soap far
away the best that I have ever used. It is the
only soap I ever tried that had any really per-
manent softening effect upon the skin. Last
summer I suffered occasionally from prickly heat,
but I quickly cured this irritating complaint
whenever it showed itself by washing with a
thick lather of your Herbal Skin Soap.—Yours
sincerely,
(Signed) L. ROBINSON.
Witness: J. Williams.
BALDNESS CURED.
43 Peel Street, West Melbourne,
June 13, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Wholesale Druggists,
14-1 G Queen-street, Melbourne.
- Dear Sirs.—About four years ago, when I first
had your Herbal Skin Soap brought under my
notice, I was almost totally bald; in fact, I had
no hair at all on the top of my head. I had tried
all kinds of so-called “ Hair Restorers,” but they
did me absolutely no good whatever ; in fact, I
was losing even the little bit of hair I still had.
About June, 1902, when I was employed at the
“ Opera House ” hy the great Australian Entre-
preneur, Mr. Harry Rickards, a friend, as a great
favor, gave me a box of your Herbal Skin Soap.
I used to wash my head with it, and after a
while I noticed that my hair had .stopped falling
out. Up to this time I did not attribute the stop-
page to using your Soap, but at last 1 coujd not
think of anything else that was stopping my hair
from falling, so I started to rub the lather well
into my head every day. I used to rub it well
in every day.for about half an hour, and at last I
noticed a thick down appearing all over my head,
which had been as “ bald as a badger ” before, and
in a little while my hair was as thick as ever, and
has remained so ever since. I may also state that
my wife finds your Herbal Skin Soap unequalled
for the Complexion, while I can say the same for
it for Shaving. I will always be pleased to give
any further information re your marvellous Herbal
Skin Soap to any enquirer, as I cannot speak too
highly of it. (Signed) HARRY AIREY.

CURATIVE IN BARCOO AND SKIN
DISEASE.
Mount Ormond Tin Mines, near Irvinebank,
North Queensland, 4th July, 1907,
Messrs. TI. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
I have given a thorough trial to your Herbal
Skin Soap, which, from my experience of its use,
I consider superior to other soaps used in con-
nection with surgical operations. It is also a
fragrant and most effective Toilet Soap.
I may inform you; that I /gave some to a lady
friend of mine, who was suffering from Prickly
Heat. She informed me that the first application
soothed the unpleasant irritation, and that, after
using it two or three times, the inflammation
entirely disappeared.
I have also used it for something from which we
suffer out here in the “Never Never " country,
where vegetables are scarce and practically un-
obtainable, and which bushmen know as the
“ Barcoo Rot ”—an angry irritant sore, that
spreads over the surface of the skin when it
receives a scratch or a slight wound, and declines
to heal for some time, even under the influence of
Carbolic Ointment and a course of Blood-Purify-.’-
ing Mixture. In this connection I have found the*
Herbal Skin Soap marvellous in its healing and
soothing qualities. I have also used it as a wash
for dressing festered wounds, for which purpose it
has shown marked curative medical healing proper-
ties, and is undoubtedly a boon to the public. I con-
sider that for Eczema or other diseases of the Skin
it is without an equal, and that when its virtues
become known and appreciated by the public it is
likely to oust the imported Skin Soaps from the
Australian market.
Your Herbal Skin Soap cleanses the Skin, frees
its pores from impurities, and guards it from the
dangers of disease. It frees the Skin, also, from
Blotches, Pimples, Sunburns and Blemishes, etc.
I can honestly recommend it to mothers when
bathing their little ones, as it allays all irritation
and strengthens the Skin. (Signed) MATTHEW
BUTLER, J.P., Mining Engineer, Mount Or-
monde Tin Mine, N. Queensland.
FALLING HAIR CURED.
Glebe Point, Sydney,
29th" May, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Clarence-street, Sydney.
Gentlemen, —I am pleased in being able to in-
form you that your celebrated Herbal Skin Soap
is by far the best soap on the market for the Skin
and Hair. My hair was falling out terribly hist
summer, and I was-advised to try a good soap,
which I did ; in fact, I tried several so-called
“good ’’ soaps, but was greatly disappointed to
find that they did not have the slightest effect on
my hair, and it still continued to fall, until one
day I noticed. your Herbal Skin Soap advertise-
ment in the Sydney Bulletin, and resolved to
give it a fair trial. I procured a box, and was so
pleased with the result that I sent for another
box, and now my hair has ceased falling alto-
gether. It is beginning to grow quite thick and
glossy, thanks to your celebrated Herbal Skin
Soap.
I shall always have much pleasure in recom-
mending it to my friends, as it is an excellent
Soap for both the Hair and the Skin, and the per-
fume is simply delightful.
(Signed) (Miss) DAISY JONES.
FOR GLOSSY HAIR AND BABY’S SKIN.
Gray Street, Brisbane, Q.,
24th April, 1902.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —I find your Herbal Skin Soap ex-
cellent for my hair. I know of no Soap to equal
it; it makes my hair soft and glossy. I also use
your Soap for washing iny baby, as it keeps his
skin free from soreness, and quite smooth and
cool. When I use your Soap for the baby, no
powder is necessary.—l remain, Sir, yours
obediently.
(Signed) (Mrs.) EMMA KENT.
FOR SCALP IRRITATION, SHAVING, Etc.
33 Dundas Place, Albert Park, Melb.,
11th August, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne, Victoria.
Gentlemen, —As the result of a fairly long ex-
perience of your Herbal Skin Soap, I can speak
most enthusiastically, and without any reserva-
tion, as to its merits, not only as a delightful
toilet preparation, but also for its great medicinal
virtues, and the feeling of solid comfort which
follows its use.
Previously to making its acquaintance, I had
been much troubled for years with Dandruff and
Scalp Irritation, accompanied by dryness and
falling of the Hair, for which I had used many
advertised preparations without any remedial
effects. A vigorous Shampoo with your Herbal
Skin Soap, however, had such a unique and
pleasant stimulating effect that I persisted in its
use, with the result that my hair is entirely free
from Dandruff, has altogether ceased falling out,
and is greatly improved in appearance.
As a Shaving Soap I consider Kugelmann’s
Herbal Skin Soap unapproachable, as it has abso-
lutely no hardening or irritating effect upon the
skin, but, on the contrary, maintains a rich,
creamy lather, which makes the operation of
shaving a delightful one, and leaves the skin in a
smooth and pliable condition.
My wife speaks in the highest terms of the
Herbal Skin Soap as a Nursery and Toilet Pre-
paration, and could not, in fact, be persuaded to
use any other than yours ; and from the numerous
friends to whom I have recommended it at various
times there has been only one expression of
opinion concerning your great preparation, and
that has been the very highest.
(Signed) P. E. NORWOOD.
SHAVING WITHOUT USUAL SORENESS.
21 Carlisle Street, Leichhardt, N.S.W.,
15th September, 1906.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
. 199 Clarence Street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs,—l also wish to compliment you on
your excellent Herbal Skin Soap. For years I
have, suffered with soreness after shaving. Then
I heard of your soap, and have used it for the past
two years; during that time I have never once
had any soreness. • I can highly recommend it to
anyone, especially those who have a tender skin.
If you think others may benefit by these lines,
you are at liberty to use them as you think fit.
Again thanking you.
(Signed) GEO. W. PARDONNE.
AN AUTHORITY ON SOAP AVOWS IT’S
DELIGHTFUL.
Ipswich, Queensland,
7th August, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Melbourne, Victoria.
Dear Sirs, —I am a Soap Manufacturer, and
can, therefore, speak with some authority on the
subject of soap/ Your Herbal Skin Soap is the
best that, so. far, has come under my notice, and I
have seen afid used pretty nearly every soap that
comes on the market. Not only has Kugelmann's
Herbal Skin Soap a delightful odor, but it has a
softening effect upon the skin, and quickly heals
up abrasions and sores.
(Signed) HY. TIVOLI HOOPER.
EXCEPTIONAL CURATIVE PROPERTIES.
Ipswich, Queensland,
7th August, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne, Victoria.
Sirs, —Of all the Soaps I have tried, I find your
Herbal Skin Soap,.easily first. Not only is it
pleasant to the skin as a toilet soap, but it has
also exceptional curative properties. To wash
with Kugelmann’s Herbal Skin Soap is like using
an ointment, for the lather cures all breaks of the
skin, pimples, etc., with which it comes in con-
tact.

TANK TALK!
WE want to induce every Amateur Photographer to at least try the tank
method of development-^— not so much because we manufacture tanks for
the development of roll film and for dry plates, but because- the tank
system ensures the highest possible percentage of good results. It is a strictly
business proposition with us; the easier and simpler we make the securing of
good results, the more popular the whole Kodak system of picture-making
becomes. There remains no argument against the time and temperature theory
the foundation of the tank system of development. Photographers everywhere
are using and enthusiastically endorsing the tank —tank development is a success.
The convenience of the method is self-evident —the dark room is absolutely done
away with when developing roll film, and employed only for loading the tank,
and for washing before fixing, with plates.
The convenience of tank development must appeal to everyone, but at the
back of convenience is the still greater consideration of economy.
It saves time, as you develop a full roll of film or a dozen plates at
once. It saves films and plater, as it ensures the highest percentage of good
printing negatives, and, lastly, it saves space, as any one of the tank outfits
may be stowed handily in a corner of your suit case, ready for instant
service on your vacation trips. The fact that the entire process of tank
development is automatic, places the merest novice on a par with the expert,
and at the same time protects both novice and expert from accidents, such as
light fog or scratches.

Chinese running is still going strong on the
Singapore-Westralian boats. The known average
pans out about a dozen Chows per vessel, and the
unknown average may be anything. The trade is
a good thing for somebody, for the Singapore
Chow will cheerfully pay from £2O to £5O for a
passage in the coal bunkers or the water tanks.
The business slumped severely last year, when a
Chinese steward, who was some sort of boss
mandarin of the “middle passage,” developed an
unpleasing habit of throwing odd Chows over-
board— presumably to save their food. On one
voyage the steward was running 13 passengers.
Now, 13 is an unlucky number, and the steward
was a superstitious sort of Chow ; so he threw the
odd Chow overboard for luck. Another stowaway
witnessed the jettison, and complained to the
Chow agency at Fremantle. There was a big row
over the incident; but nothing happened beyond
the aforesaid temporary slump in the Chow-run-
ning business.
Queensland Farms. —Welcome news indeed to
anyone looking for a first-class farm will be found in
another column in this issue. Messrs. Weaver and
Glasson Limited, of Brisbane, announce that they' are
subdividing in areas, to suit purchasers, the far-famed
“Mondure” Estate. This property consists of 21,000
acres of exceptionally rich land. It has an average rain-
fall of 31 inches per annum, and is permanently watered by
running streams, to which nearly every farm will have a
frontage. For land of the quality of “Mondure,” the
prices from £2 10s. per acre seem absurdly low, especially
with ten years’ terms and only one-fifth cash deposit.
There are no survey or residential conditions. A railway
station is only four miles distant from “Mondure.” So
convinced are Messrs. Weaver and Glasson, that they will
pay the fare of purchasers from any station in Australia.
Write them for particulars. Weaver and Glasson Limited,
289 Queen Street (next G.P.0.), Brisbane.*

SUMMARY.
The Company holds the patent rights for the Cotton Burner in France and her Colonies. Furnaces designed to
use this burner will be erected in New Caledonia for the treatment of Nickel and other ores. NO FURNACE FOR
THE TREATMENT OF ANY ORE EXISTS IN NEW CALEDONIA TO-DAY. The local Magnesite will be used in
the furnac sto be erected. Profits from the sale of this Magnesite and Bricks manufactured from same are estimated
to exceed £2OOO per annum. The Cotton Burner has successfully produced Nickel in Sydney from New Caledonian
ore, which ore exists in enormous quantities. The demand for Nickel is rapidly increasing, as it is the chief factor
in the best qualities of steel used in all modern machinery and battleships. AS THE RESULT OF OAREFUI
EXPERIMENTS MADE IN SYDNEY, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT ONE FURNACE USING COTTON’S BURNER
WILL EARN £20,000 PER ANNUM. THE CAPITAL PROPOSED SHOULD COVER THE COST OF ERECTING
TWO OR MORE FURNACES.
Prospectuses, containing fullest information, will be supplied to intending investors on application to the
Secretary.
Early application will be necessary, as the sliare list is rapidly filling.
Correction in
Grain Drill Award
We beg to advise that through a misunderstanding Mr. J. J. McNickle,
of Kurrajong Park, Wagga, N.S. W., was placed eighth upon the list of
competitors for prizes awarded by us for the largest acreage sown by a
Grain Drill.
The acreage stated for Mr. McNickle was 5,858. This statement,
however, was an error—caused partially by Mr. McNickle and partially
by ourselves.
We have now investigated the matter carefully, and are thoroughly
satisfied that Mr. McNickle has put in 11,371 acres with the one Grain
Drill, which would have easily entitled him to first prize.
The responsibility for this error being divided, we have supplied Mr.
McNickle with a new Drill at £l4 instead of £2B, as he would have been
entitled to have paid under the original award.
We take great pleasure in making this correction, feeling sure that
all concerned will be glad to see justice done to Mr. McNickle in
this matter.
We are very confident that his acreage is a record for Australasia.
In this connection we draw special attention to the Prizes which we
have offered to the 10 farmers who have harvested the largest acreage
with a Reaper and Binder of ANY make.
Those farmers who have not particulars of this offer should obtain
them without delay.
Under this offer you have an excellent opportunity of obtaining a
brand new Binder FREE.

PACKET OF TWELVE 6d. PACKET C TEN, sc;.
Mr. G. P. Carey, an old and popular actor on the Aus-
tralian stage, has been ordered a long rest, and is now a
idlest at St. Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney.
“ Ancient Ruin ” writes : “ Miss Bett.y Ohls (which is al
i-ontraction of the full German name) is not the first star
to catch a wealthy McQ.uade. •' Miss Cecily Durrant, who
came to this country with the Emily Soldene opera com-
pany in 1877, married a McQuade. By the marriage Mrs.
McQuade became the owner of Her Majesty’s Theatre and
a lot of other valuable city property.
G. P. Huntley, the Hoggenheimer of the first Aus-
tralian production of “The Girl from Kay’s,” and a fish-
witted British johnnie in various other productions,
scoffs, in a recent interview, at the idea that he gets his
jokes from the authors. “No, no,” he says, “ a comedian
gets his jokes anywhere but from the authors.”
The Mexican theatre that caught fire through the ex-
plosion of a biograpn film was only a flimsy, wooden
structure. Adjoining the theatre were a post office,
customshouse, and shipping office, which likewise con-
flagrated, so the fact that 300 people lost their li\ es in the
lire and the panic was not so alarming to Australian
picture-show patrons as it looked in the cablegram.
There are no licensed matchwood theatres in this country,
or, if there are, the local Board of Health should be burn t,
in the first place.
Maud Thornton (she Calls herself “Maudie” nowa-
days) took the place of Carrie Moore in Courtneidge’s
panto, of “ Cinderella ” at the London Adelphi what
time Carrie was out of the bill. And the newspapers
spoke of Maudie as the lady who “ made such a hit ” as
the Merry Widow in South Africa. Ballarat will be erect-
ing a statue of Maudie if she goes on like this.
“Melba”: A new terror has been added to theatre-
going by a recent case in London. A man was charged with
frequenting the Duke of York’s Theatre, “supposedly for
the purpose of comnuttingafelony.” The detectivesswore,
in proof of the charge, that the accused seemed to take
no interest in the performance. Fortunately, the magis-
trates did not regard this as sufficient proof, and dismissed
the case. It is hard enough to sit out some of the shows
we have to endure, but it is surely the limit when a bored
playgoer is required to evince interest and appreciation
under pain of being arrested.
Bert Levy, in his illustrated London Notes to the New
York Morning Tklkgkapii, mentions that when he was
returning to’Murka on the Lusitania, “Melba was par-
ticularly gracious— not because I am an Australian, but
because I made a sketch of her which I promised not to
publish. She said she always liked to look sweet in the
papers.”
Brother Charles Tait (of Allan’s) writes from London 6f
musical shows he has lately sampled “ The best comic
opera on the ‘ Continong’ just now is ‘The Dollar Prin-
cess,’ by a Viennese named Leo Fall. The plot is taken
from “The Taming of the'Shrew” ; and, according to gossip
in Vienna, it was suggested by the great Brahms many
years ago to Fall, who was a caf'C pal of his. Even
Brahms, it seems, had frivolous ideas when he lapsed into
cafb society. Went to the Pavilion the other night, and
saw Little Tieh. He was the draw, and he drew like a
blister. A great show is “ The Merry Widow ”in London
—so clean and crisp. Lily Elsie would make a Chow
leave his home, and Coyne, as the waltzing lover, was
excellent—but Higginson is just as good. To my mind,
the best of the crowd was Popoff, the old diplomat. On
the other hand, the Flo Young of the cast was
worse than to be thought of in compari-
son with our Florence. On Saturday night I saw
the great Maud Allan at the Palace Theatre.
Note the 5 small “g” in great. What a disap-
pointment ! She did three dances, two of them to
Greig’s music, and any youngster in the ballet at J.O. W.’s
could do as good. The management at the Palace knows
how to gull its public. When Maud’s turn is announced
there is a huehed silence. Down comes the curtain and
down go the lights, and you are kept in darkness for
about twenty seconds. The band plays a Greig piece, and
out comes Maud in naked feet, which she forgets to
powder, so they look red. She quivers about the stage
for five or 10 minutes, and waves her hands like a street
hawker selling flounders, and wriggles them like
Morrissey’s snakes ; but there is no art in it. Finally, she
does the Salome act, and in this she is at least fairly well
dressed, in parts of her. She cavorts about a lot until
clang goes a bell, and from what looks like a butcher’s
block the head of John the Bap. pops up. The head is
hut a crude affair—a cross between a panto giant’s and a
cow’s. Maud globbers [new and expressive word] over it,
kisses it, and fools around, and the people—or some of them
—think itfine, butto meitseemed utterly inartistic. I saw
many imitators of Maud Allan on the Continent, and they
lost her easily. I’m sure it’s only dear old London that
would stand her particular kind of imposture. All the
talk in the violin world is of one Sascha Colbertson, who
has set all Berlin and Vienna marvelling. They com-
pare him to Paganini, and say he eclipses Kubelik.
He was born in Russia—father a South American
and mother a Russian—and is 15 years old. Saw the
new color kinematograph just put on at the Palace. Th y
have a long way to go yet before the thing is perfect.
The colors run into one another and spoil the effect.”
An actress whose marriage in Australia was followed
by some picturesque happenings is said to have found
some more cause for connubial anxiety in London.
Winter in the United States is a dull and dreary time
for players. Vaudeville especially languishes, so it is
cheering to hear chat one star who has, by the perma-
nency of her brilliance, established a claim to be numbered
amongst those who shirie all the year round, is Annette
Kellermann, our shapely sea doggess. She has been going
scrong now in the chief cities for weeks on end, and has
enhanced tier aquarium performance by the introduction
of a huge mirror, which is suspended at a cunning ancle
at the back of the stage. The result is that the spectators
get two mermaids for the price of one.
“ Micawber ” : Three of “ the Five St. Leons,” now doing
a Sydney music-hall turn, are grandchildren of the
St. Leon who ran the first circus and menagerie that
travelled in N.S.W. The grandfather arrived in Mel-
bourne from England when “ Tinker ” Brown was running
a small goldfields show to enormous business. When
things waned, Brown offered L5O per week to any person
who could throw a clean back somersault. St. Leon got
the job. After he had accumulated sufficient money he
started for himself in N.S. W. The circus and menagerie
were a success, and St. Leon then exploited Maoriland with
a No. 2 show. For the new venture he absorbed the ma-
jority of his good acts, with the result that the N.S. W.
show suffered. To save the latter, lie withdrew
from Maoriland, with the intention of amalgamating the
two forces, but on the trip across a heavy sea drowned or
killed all his animals. Thoroughly disheartened, St.
Leon retired and left the business to his two sons, the
father of the three boys and Alf (a ringmaster in America,
who died last February). The young St. Leons left for
America in 1901, and have had a successful time. Thejr
idea now is to resurrect the St. Leon circus, and they are
grafting hard towards that end.
Sydney Telegraph (7/4/’O9) spoke from the higher
plane :
If there is one question that ought to be kept above the
low plane of party intrigue it is that of national defence.
In England no party would think of making political
capital by juggling with the safety of the country, and
whenever the question comes up in a vital form, Free-
traders, Protectionists, and all other “ ists ” disappear.
They at once merge into the British party.
Singularly enough, about the very time the Tele-
graph was speaking thus ecstatically about the
way they do things in England, London Daily
Chronicle was talking on the same subject:—
It is most undesirable that the navy should continue to
be dragged along party lines. The fact is that there is
too much of tactics in this matter.
The Government, for tactical reasons, combines the
cry of danger with a hypothetical way of meeting it. The
Opposition, for tactical reasons, magnifies the danger,
and reduces the hypothetical quartette of Dreadnoughts
to phantom ships.
Now what do they do in England t

THE THERMOS FLASK
EVERY Squatter, Motorist, Yachtsman, and everyone whose work or pleasure
takes them out into the heat or cold, will find the celebrated THERMOS
FLASK invaluable.
It keeps hot drinks hot for 24 hours and cold drinks cold for days.
Fill it up with a pint of hot tea in the early morning, and when you
feel you would like a drink of hot tea, it is there just as when you poured
it in. Just the same with an iced whisky and soda, or any other cold drink.
Thermos, Invaluable for Infants.
Here, there, everywhere you go a Thermos proves its utility. In the
nursery it is invaluable.
In the park, away from the nursery, Thermos gives hot milk, clean —
fresh—health-giving. No trouble at all to carry.
At eventime or early morn soothing hot liquids always ready. No trouble —
no preparation—if your nurse has a Thermos.
The sick room lacks proper equipment if a Thermos is not to hand.
Workers with hand and brain, from navvy to monarch, use Thermos. Every
and anyone must recognise that Thermos is invaluable, indispensable; on
pleasure bent or on work intent Thermos is invaluable just the same. Depend
on yourself for a cooling drink, a hot drink—Thermos will provide both—a
drink that is fresh and inviting and can be had just when you want it. The
man, or woman, provided with a Thermos Flask waits no one's pleasure only
his or her own.
Makes a splendid gift from one friend to another, or for a wife to give to
her husband.

Pugh’s Queensland Almanac has com-
pleted its fiftieth year. It was first published as
Pugh’s Moreton Bay Almanac in 1859, by
Theophilus P. Pugh, at the Free Press office, in
Albert-street, Brisbane. Pugh was a man of some
tonnage in Bananaland in the ’fifties and ’sixties
of last century. He was in turn editor of the
Brisbane Courier, Government Printer, and
member of the Queensland Parliament.
More or less casual efforts are being made
to turn some of the bigger islands along the Great
Barrier Reef to better account. On one of the
water-washed fragments comprising the Palm
Islands, off Townsville, a rennet apple tree has
lately been displaying to surprised Bailanalanders
a heavy crop of healthy-looking fruit. Some three
or four years ago different varieties of apple and
pear were introduced for experimental purposes ;
but the pear trees have all proved blanks so far.
In the Challenger Bar settlement Lisbon lemons
are being tried, and so far they are flourishing as
well as the Queensland tropical and semi-tropical
fruits.
One Cross is alleged to have invented a
cheap and effective prickly pear destroyer. On
March 6 he used it on a patch of pear on the
School of Arts’ raserve at Sandgate (Q.). A month
later Under-Secretary Seriven, of the Queensland
Agricultural Department, and several Sandgate
aldermen are alleged to have been satisfied that
the stems, leaves, and roots of the spiny curse had
been killed outright, and would burn readily.
Cross claims that he can clear large areas of the
anathema at a cost of less than £1 per acre. But
before taking on a big patch he’s going to deal with
a couple of acres on the Mosquito Creek reserve
for the Sandgate Town Council. Then, if success-
ful, he’s going to have a shot at the £lO,OOO
reward offered by the Queensland Government.
The Simple Life.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f DARIv was a man of mark,
Who sold sugar and soap and tea;
And with broom and mop cleaned out his
shop,
Yet a sorrowful man was he.
For the demon sin had entered in,
And fraud in the trade was rife—
As a pious man, on a pious plan,
He longed for the Simple Life.
A preacher (lay) he’d groan and pray,
And deplore the sins of the world
Where Satan ruled, and vice was pooled,
And the Saints from their thrones were hurled—
That saving Dark, the man of mark,
Who was pure where vice was rife—
Though he sold bad tea, like old Mick Magee,
Yet he longed for the Simple Life.
He bought a gamp. With an iron clamp
Bound his Bible, and sailed one day
To the Coral Sea, where the life is free,
And sinners are far away.
When he touched the strand, said a chieftain
grand,
“You come for an Island wife?”
“Na, na,” said Dark, the man of mark,
“ I come for the Simple Life.”
For a month or more the coral shore
Rang loud with the preacher’s voice ;
And the lone atolls, where the mermaid lolls,
Re-echoed: “Rejoice! Rejoice!
For a holy man of the holy clan
Has banished the club and knife ” ;
And the whispering palms in the evening calms
Murmured, “ Praise ye the Simple Life ! ”
But the tale grows long, and the siren’s song
Seemed sweet to the ears of Dark ;
Like a lullaby in that coral sea
It shipwrecked the man of mark.
His clerical coat soon went afloat,
And the rest of his garb as well
Now an Island mat, and not much of that,
Is his garb as an Island swell.
To his wife at home, across the foam,
He is purging himself from sin ;
In that Coral Sea, where the Life is free,
And no evil enters in.
The old bad tea—like Mick Magee—
As becometh a guid old wife
She sells each day, while her man, she’ll say,
Is living the Simple Life.
If she only knew, what could she do—
Much better that she is blind
To the Island ways, where the siren strays
And sings on the morning wind.
For her old guid man, on the Island plan,
Has forgotten the guid old wife—
And, truth to tell, with an Island belle,
He is living the Simple Life.
He has burned the gamp, and the iron clamp
With the Bible has gone to sea ;
He has three wives now, to a fourth made vow—
In the Islands the Life is free.
No more lie moans, or in travail groans,
Of the world and its sin and strife ;
But he says, “ It’s grand on this coral strand ;
HoOray for the Simple Life.”

CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.
Health, Hope and Happiness are three insepar-
able blessings—and yet few possess them. Excess
is the tyrant that destroys them all with one
stroke. By impairing the digestive organs, excess
destroys the perfect circulation of the blood. The
blood is the carrier that conveys nutriment to
every cell in the body. Let it be disturbed
by ever so slight a cause and the entire organ-
ism suffers. Have you a healthy circulation?
FRANZ JOSEF Natural Aperient Water will
assist you to get it. A dose taken before break-
fast will tone the stomach, awaken the liver,
clear the intestines, and send the rich, new blood
bounding on its travels, carrying with it Health,
Hope and Happiness.
When Reconstruction Comes.
A correspondent in Central Queensland asks for
information and makes an admission :
What guarantee can be given that Unification would be
followed by (a) the necessary 7 subdivision of territory and
creation of provinces, each with its own capital and legis-
lature, and (b) a sufficient devolution of self-government
to the provinces to ensure their proper development and
prosperity? If you would show how this can be assured,
it would help materially to elucidate the problem,
And the admission comes last:—
In 1892 present Chief Justice S. W. Griffith brought
in a Bill to divide Queensland into three provinces. The
late Tiios. Mcllwraitii supported it as a wise and philo-
sophic proposal, but it was unfortunately frustrated by
the short-sightedness of the representatives of South
Queensland, a blunder which must sooner or later demand
rectification.
The 1892 attempt to secure the urgently necessary
subdivision of Queensland was only one of a dozen
movements to the same end ; and there have been
a dozen movements to subdivide other States. In
fact, there rarely is a time when some misgoverned
or neglected part of a State isn’t attempting to
secure a readjustment of State boundaries, which
are universally admitted to 'be unscientific and
absurd. Nothing, however, has come of any of
these agitations for the past 50 years, and there
isn’t any visible hope that anything will come of
any similar(and purely State) movements that there
may be for the next 50 years, notwithstanding
the admitted absurdities and anomalies of the
present divisions and the unwieldiness of some of
the existing States. On the other hand, if the
whole Commonwealth were thrown into the pot,
there would simply have to be a subdivision ; and
the scientific laying out of the boundaries would
follow as a matter of course. It is true that,
under the Commonwealth Constitution, new
States and Territories may be created by the
subdivision of any existing State ; but the sub-
division of any existing State (which, moreover,
can only be done with the State’s consent) wouldn’t
OMINOUS.
LOCAL DOCTOR (fixing it up with his locum tenens). “ Well, that’s about all it is necessary to
know. Still, if you can think of anything else ”
LOCUM TENENS: "Who’s your undertaker? ”
necessarily fill the bill, because some of the exist-
ing boundaries ought to be shifted, and a mere
subdivision of an existing State wouldn’t shift
any existing boundary. The position is exactly
the same as that which has arisen in the oldest
parts of the city of Sydney. Streets wandered
here and there, and anyhow; and the land was
cut up in any shape, or no shape at all. ’ The re-
sult was that sanitation was horrible, the death
rate shocking, and public inconvenience colossal.
For 50 years attempts were made to hack off
corners, and push a narrow street back a few
yards, and reduce chaos to order piecemeal.
The attempt was a howling failure, and finally
the plague-rat mounted on top of the ruins
and laughed derision at the crowd that wouldn’t
go the whole hog. The grinning plague rat was
the most powerful orator that the city had ever
listened to. The worst of the jumbled, area was
thrown into the pot, just as it is proposed that
Australia should be thrown into the pot; and
order was then evolved. The result was so re-
markably good that the plan is being followed in
the next-worst and most vilely-smelling jumbles
of the city; and it will be carried much farther
yet. The plan gets over in one giant step difficul-
ties which the public had been trying to surmount
in a hundred goatish little skips," and then didn’t
surmount after all; and exactly the same goatish
little skips are being relied upon to surmount the
financial, railway, industrial and other problems
in the larger Australian sphere. Some people
profess, however, to be filled with a great dread
that, if the Commonwealth gets all power into its
own hands, it won’t let any of it go. The people
who talk like that assume that the Commonwealth
is some foreign concern, which derives its power
from Thibet or Formosa, or some other far-away
place or potentate. It is really a mistake. If the
Commonwealth, being ridded of the curse of State
Frights, wants to be governed in a certain way,
it will be governed in that way. There
will be absolutely no power (except such as “the
Crown” has) to stop it. The Federal Convention
was a body representing Australia. It might just
as easily have hung on to twice as much power as
it did; but, mistakenly, it handed back whole
shovelsful to the States, simply because it had an
idea that the States could handle certain things
better. Under Unification, and until the Recon-
struction is made, the Commonwealth Parliament
will be very like the Federal Convention ; and,
judging by Australia’s experience of that'body,
the danger will be, not that it will hang on to too
much power for itself, but that it will hand over
too much to the remodelled States.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP
Brisbane, April 17, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Lord of Chelmsford, having donned a more
or less suitable toilette, has departed for the land
of the scantily-clad Papuan, where he will, no
doubt, discourse with the leading aboriginals and
scatter a few medals. Then he will return to
assist at a final pump-handling at the vice-regal
shelter. Meanwhile her Ex., all smiles and
looking decidedly the better for her country
sojourn, is attending meetings and generally
setting things straight ere she betakes herself off
to your harbor. It looks as if the Milk Institute
would open its doors while she is still with us, but
these portals are to be opened just by the care-
taker or the nurse, with no fuss, no golden key,
and no feasting. Any trumpet-blowing will come
later on, when the baby-saving movement has
proved a success.
The Army came back to town on Friday, and
in the evening put on its best clothes and went to
the theatre, so that the dress circle resembled
nothing so much as a Fish-Ho window full of
boiled crayfish wreathed in parsley. Most of the
women wore greenery on the thatch —hence the
parsley idea. Mrs. Bland Holt, during her career
of frank dishonesty, acquired much vegetable
matter. The vice-regal box, wherein lingered
Mrs. Chelmsford, with various of the little
Cbelmsfords, a governess, and aide Frank
Newton, was likewise trying to understudy a
market garden.
Harrie Ireland, in powdered wig and miles of
trailing draperies, is knocking Brisbane sideways,
and so is the graceful Pollock damsel, while as
for the Holt pair—well, they duet as of yore under
the eve of a packed and affectionate gallery, whose
devotion nothing can quench.
Strange are the disasters that can befall
bachelorhood. I sat, the other night, behind two
charmers who, in the intervals of bellowdrama,
discussed the boys of the old brigade. “And
where’s Percy?” asked No. 1, who had evidently
just returned from some place. “Did he do
anything ? ” “He married,” was the bored reply
of No. 2. “But where is he now ? ” “With the
others,” said the bored one. And she said it in a
tone which implied that the married and the
buried were the same crowd, and that Percy had
joined the innumerable caravan of those who have
gone under.
By the way, the gay Moretons (9th A.1.R.)
gave a party last Sunday at Lytton. There was a
steamer down the river and an ambulance waggon
to remove the pieces to the mess tent. Girleens
by the score fluttered along the canvas boule-
vards, and on the hill they were taken by the
hand and bade good-day to by Lieutenant-Colonel
Hopkins, wearing a brand-new long-service medal
on his upper diaphragm, or lower collar-bone.
Mrs. Hop wore blue.
What with the Easter holiday and many dozens
of infatuated young people running to the priest,
it’s been a strenuous week. Monday saw a very
frocky crowd at Ascot. It included a real live
earl, a slender person called Stanhope, who, when
he wasn’t occupied with a spy-glass and a camera,
just twined his Chippendale supports round each
other and gazed unutterable tilings at a very
charming person in purple. Mrs. Arthur Feez,
in pea-green cut with an easy grace, and daughter
Mai, looking like a fragile white rose in a bed of
lilies of the valley, entertained Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson (in a lovely directoire robe), the Leish-
man couple, Mrs. Cecil Palmer and her lawful
lord, and the Chippendale earl at a smart motor
lunch and tea. The wife of pearl-king Clark was
another noteworthy froeker on the occasion.
The Wright-Delpratt wedding came off softly
on Wednesday, and the bride looked her best in a
cloudy confection of oriental lisse and charmeuse.
There were five juvenile bridesmaids and two who
were almost grown up. After kissing a lot of
them the bridegroom escaped with his newly-
acquired treasure in a motor and hasn’t been heard
of since. If discovered within a day or so, he will
probably hustle her on board the Marmora en
route for the Cold Lands.
It really looks as if women were getting their
rights at last. I saw six downtrodden males,
one of them an ex-Mayor of the city, calmly
retain their seats in a railway carriage from Ascot
one day recently, while at least one woman,
old enough to be their mother, stood hanging on
to a strap. A younger woman finally came to the
rescue, but Mr. ex-Mayor never shifted.
The Stuart Leishmans pack their carpet-bag
early next month, and trip to Britain. Mrs.
Leishman was Miss Gertie Blakeney, and seems
to have found the secret of perpetual youth.
State member E. B. Forrest is so stuck up these
days that he passes his friends as an Englishman
would a pig. The cause is a brand-new grandson,
which only missed by a hair being a birthday gift.
A social shock of a pan-American variety was
provided on Saturday, when a cable from N’Yark
city announced the marriage of Miss Mabel Perry,
of this city, and one of the Four Hundred of
Brother Jonathan’s commercial metropolis. The
affair isn’t as sudden as it sounds, for the stylish
Queenslander played havoc with the sensibilities
of Uncle Sam’s nephew some years ago, and that
energetic individual having got his lady love to
once more plant her foot on the land of spars and
tripes seized upon her and made her give an
affirmative answer. The bride comes back in
June to say family farewells ere she finally sets up
housekeeping on pork and beans.
The business of counting political heads is be-
coming more and more a nightmare. The break-
aways, or rumored breakaways, are so numerous
that the air is thick with Ministers flying off per
motor and rail and steamer to seize the lost sheep
by the wool and bring them back. Rumor hath
it that one Minister is himself turning and twist-
ing his outer garment trying to remember which
way he had it on the time before last. Redwood,
Maxwell and Rankin are among the most recent
alleged unknown quantities.
A movement is on foot under the patronage of
Mayoress Wilson to present a gaud studded with
Queensland gems to her Excellency ere she de-
parts.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.

“S. Remo ” : The loss of the Bulloo seat
(Bulloo was the late Speaker Leahy’s stamping
ground)has put the fear of death into the Kid-Philp
coalition. In an effort to raise Lazarus, the Tory,
from his grave they have started an organisation
called the Peoples’ Progressive League. Phidston
is president and Kilp is vice-president. The
P:P.L. held its first meeting the other night!
Several well-seasoned back-numbers rallied round
the flag, and said “Hear hear” as the
president and vice-president delivered orations;
When people see hard-shell, Copper-plated Tories
like Philp, Forrest, Jack Annear and Kanaka
Cowley taking leading parts in the organisation,
they naturally wonder where the progressiveness
comes in. Maybe the idea is to progress back-
wards. , In that case it should be called the Back-
sliders’ Association. Some idea of the amazing
popularity of the P.P.L. may be gauged from the
haste with which certain people are flying into
print with the announcement that they have not
joined it. It is reminiscent of the hurry with
which Smith—who is one of the white-waistcoats
of his suburb—hurls at the public an indignant
denial of the rumor that he is the Smith who was
arrested and fined 40s. or a month for beating a
cabman over the head with his umbrella.

“7 began with £lOO ten years ago.

“ A laboring man could easily earn about £2OO a

“7 would recommend a man to take up dairy
farming. Cows can be bought for about £4 to £7

about £1 per acre. You hare long terms, about 20
years, to pay for your land, and the payments are
not equal to a good rent in the Old Country.
“A man could easily make a start here with

THE WEALTH OF THE DAIRY.
By J. D. FitzGekald.
If a special example were needed of the wise com-
bination of private enterprise and communal
organisation which has been so beneficial in
Queensland, the dairying industry furnishes it.
The merits of Queensland butters are becoming
known in the markets of the world, north and
east. It is a matter which concerns the State and
the whole people that the export trade is organ-
ised so that nothing but the very best shall be
sent into markets where the keenest competition
exists. The merchant in Mark-lane (to take that
small street as a symbol of commercial London)
RUT HEN BERG'S, GAT TON, QUEENSLAND.
will readily handle butter which he knows
is milked, separated, handled, .graded, packed,
stamped, and -shipped under the'supervision of
State inspectors. He has confidence when he
knows that the strictest regulation as to cleanliness
and sanitation is enforced in the dairies ; though
in a sense that does not concern him so much,
remembering that poor quality butters are not
exported if their export can be prevented. He
gets a still higher opinion of the Queensland
brands when he knows that Government agricul-
tural colleges are testing the milk-producing
qualities of the various breeds of cattle, that the
Government stud bulls are available in the private
herds, that Government chemists are analysing
cattle foods and grasses, and the bacteriologists
are able to save millions of pounds of butter
annually by the knowledge which they impart to
dairymen.
In considering the dairying industry, I must
connect it with mixed farming. “ Who are the
most successful farmers?” asks the author of
“ Terse Information About Queensland.” “ Those
who carry on mixed farming, such as dairying,
agriculture, sheep, pig and poultry raising, hoi ti-
culture, and bee-farming.” And, he continues,
“ Many of these farmers now go in for lamb-raising
on lucerne. There are also a number of selectors
who have sheep on areas of from 640 to 4000 acres.”
But the backbone of this “ poor man’s industry ’’
is butter, or, perhaps, it would be more accurate
to say butter,’bacon and cheese, the allied pro-
ducts of mixed farming, on a small or large scale.
The dairy industry is a mere infant. Queensland
was the last of all the States to take it up
seriously. Mr. J. Mahon, principal of the
Agricultural College, tells us that “no
other industry in Queensland has made such rapid
development. The importance of this branch of
farming is making itself felt in all parts of the
State, not only by those actually engaged in the
business, but also by large landowners and business
people in every centre. Indeed,” he proceeds, “it
is freely admitted by all who have watched the
growth of the dairying industry that the success
of our farmers in all the leading centres is to be
attributed to dairy-farming combined with pig-
raising. Maize-growing in most of the best agri-
cultural districts has been superseded by dairy-
farming, and only a small area of land is now
under cultivation—sufficient to raise green fodder
for dairy stock, with small patches of maize for
pig-feeding.”
As late as 1889 Queensland was a large importer
of butter. She did not raise enough for her own
use, and in that year imported 781,0001 b. Ten
years later, in 1899, 8,462,5951 b. of butter were
manufactured in Queensland, and the following
year there was an increase in production of
217,7941 b. In 1900, Queensland, which had in?-
ported butter for its own use 10 years before, ex-
ported 1,389,0001 b., worth £51,000. That is some-
thing of which a State may be proud, and prouder
in that it was the result of pre-determined pro-
gress, in consequence of that which is sometimes

the State and the individual wealth-earning
agencies. For the State of Queensland recognises
that the aim of democratic government is to in-
crease the wealth-making opportunities of the
individual in order that the aggregate wealth of
the community may be increased. This is what
may be called a good sound principle of vvork-a-
aa3 T Socialism on a dividend-earning basis.
The Queensland methods, without drums,
flags, blood and slaughter, brass bands, Mar-
seillaises, or man-millinery and red neckties,
are making poor men comfortable, and com-
fortable men rich, and that not by means of a
gigantic State tombola or gamble, but by enabling
them first of all to produce direct from the soil,
and next to sell that produce for the best price in
the best market, under the most favorable condi-
tions. The secret of this wonderful develop-
merit, which has given the “small man” such an
industrial..lift in Queensland, is, that in such coun-
tries as Great Britain either the climatic conditions
are unfavorable for the production of dairy pro-
duc-e, or the people are too busy on other
and, under the circumstances, more remunera-
tive pursuits, or the land is not available

for the purpose. The Briton looks abroad
for his butter, and here is the Queens-
lander’s market. Then, again, the discovery
of cold storage has made the transportation of
perishable products possible, and millions in
Europe who never tasted anything but margar-
ines and cheap imitations of butter are now able
to buy the real thing itself at a reasonable price ;
while millions in the East are beginning to acquire
a taste for the sweet, pure butters from Queens-
land. Wherever you find butter that is really
edible in the Philippines, or Java. Singapore,
Hongkong, Shanghai, Tokio, or Nagasaki, you
will at once know that it is Australian.
The small output of ten years ago has since
grown to an enormous bulk. The produce of the
dairy farms of Queensland in 1907 was as follows :

To emphasise this a contrast must be made
betwebn 1907 and 1903, in order to show the
rapidity of the development—a development
which is increasing with tremendous velocity :

So that in fours years there was an increase in
production in these lines of over 200 per cent.
The dairies of Queensland in 1907 produced
62,623,129 gallons of milk; and from this milk
20,828.0801 b. of butter were manufactured at the
central factories (co-operative effort) and
1,961,0781 b. by individual farmers. A fact worth
mentioning in connection with this is that in 1907
the factory butter output was less by 445,0051 b.
than in 1906, while the farmers 5 butter had in-
creased by 487,5701 b. This means doubtless that
the farmers are getting in their own separators.
As to export of butter, the following table will
show its growth by leaps and bounds

Total for five years 48,689,7161 b. ..£1,936,518
It is to be noted, too, that the price of butter
realised has increased as the quality has increased
—and that followed upon better farming and more
skilful methods—as, for example, while in 1904
Queensland butter was at Bfd., in 1906 and 1907
it realised lOd. per lb.
Cheese, which goes with butter production,
and may even supersede it in certain circum-
stances, pays well, and the prospects of a large
increase of the output are good. The Queensland
dairy expert said that the State is remarkably
suitable for the production of cheese, and ex-
pressed the opinion that “it would be easy to
send cheddars to London quite equal to the best
Canadian and Maoriland, and that an assured
success awaited such an undertaking if properlv
conducted.” It is known that it takes 2| gallons
of milk to make lib. of butter, sold at lOd., while
less than a gallon will make lib. of cheese, at 4d.
to sd. per lb.
Honey is another side line of mixed farming. In
1906, 498,9201 b. of honey were produced, and in
that year 81,4491 b. were exported. But there is
no need to unduly emphasise the “side lines.”
The dairying industry is going to enrich the State
enormously, and it is a concern of the small man ;
and the man who has a family, and is not, there-
fore, dependent upon casual labor, has a splendid
chance. As to how the State has fostered the
dairying industry, let us consider a few points :
1 — It has surveyed and classified land which
is available to the settler.
2 It has built railways to bring the butter to
the ship’s side.
3 It has subsidised steamship services to
carry the produce to London, Africa, and
Asia.
4 It has established agricultural colleges to
experiment, and to develop the best
breeds of dairy cattle.
5 It has imported bulls to improve the
Queensland herds.
6 It has supplied travelling instructors
(skilled lecturers and teachers) to increase
the expert knowledge of the dairymen.
7 It subsidises agricultural shows held
throughout the State annually, and these
afford an opportunity to exchange experi-
ence, and to see the latest methods —for
the Government itself is generally an
exhibitor (hors concours).
8— It has supplied experimental chemists,
analysing soils; and botanists, who ad-
vise on fodders and grasses, etc.
9 It supplies inspectors, who insist on clean-
liness in the processes, and who emphasise
the importance of scientific methods of
dairy farming.
10— Its officers weigh, test and grade the
butters, and stamp the grade on the box,
so that the customer in London, Shang-
hai, Capetown or Java knows that the
Government of Queensland guarantees
that what he buys is of the “nature,
quality and substance demanded.”
11— The State supplies financial assistance,
under the local Acts, and makes advances
to farmers to establish co-operative dairy
factories, to factory companies, creameries,
cheese factories and meat companies.
The word of an “old hand” on the procedure
for newcomers to adopt will be of far more practi-
cal value than the theoretical knowledge of others.
Mr. J. Edmiston, of Alton Downs, near Rock-
hampton, a pioneer, says he would recommend the
newcomer to take up dairy farming. He can pur-
chase land from about £1 per acre upwards
(certain lands are obtainable for nothing), with
long terms to pay off the purchase money. Cows
can be got for £4 to £7 apiece. Says Mr. Edmis-
ton : “ A man could easily make a good start here
with about £l5O. That money would be used for
paying the first instalment on his land purchase,
buying a few cows, and putting up his house. . ... ■
I began with£loo about ten. years ago. I have
paid for my land some time since, and I reckon
that at the present time I am worth about £2ot)o
in land and stock.”
Besides the staple butter, this settler has grown
oats for hay, maize for horse and fowl feed, Eng-
lish and sweet potatoes, poultry, various kinds of
fodder plants, ground nuts, fruits, and other
kinds of produce. On the Darling Downs and
West Moreton, large quantities of lucerne, wheat
and barley are grown. Sweet potatoes, says Mr.
Edmiston, run about 40 tons per acre on an avei-
age. At 30s. to £3 per ton, you get £6O to £l2O
per acre for the crop. English potatoes in his
district average about five tons to the Mere, and at
£6 a ton the yield is £3O per acre. But he has
grown all crops and has made money from them
all. This illustration will show that the small
man has no difficulty in making a start, and once
he has made the start, the rest is easy. As
noted in the heading to this article, a man may
make a good living from two or three acres of
land set with pineapples or other tropical fruits.
To do any fine writing, or employ lurid phrases,
upon the subject of the chances of the emigrant in
dairying, would be gilding refined gold and
painting the lily. There is no branch of wealth-
making in which is it so easy to get a start, and
once started, it depends upon a man’s individual
abilities, skill, care and courage as to whether he
will be a success or a failure. And there is no
jealousy, for the greater the production the
cheaper the freights, and the greater number of
steamship lines will run to Queensland.

I feel for what Cuticura Remedies have

age, and had never
had anything the
matter with her
skin until four
months ago, when
an eruption broke
out on her chest.
The first symptom
was a redness, and then followed thicken-
ing and blisters, which would break and
run matter. I took her to a doctor,,
and he pronounced it to be eczema of a
very bad form. He treated her, but
instead of being checked, the disease
spread. It showed itself on her back,
and then quickly spread upwards until
the whole of her head was affected, and
all her hair had to be cut off. The pain
she suffered was excruciating, and
what with that and the heat and tin-
§ling her life was almost unbearable.
he became run down in health, and at
times was very feverish, languid, and
drowsy, and occasionally she was de-
lirious. Her nerves were in such a low
state that she could not bear to be left
alone. In spite of the cold weather
she would insist on having her bedroom
window open, and would lean out on
the window-sill. She did not have a
proper hour’s sleep for many nights.
The _ second doctor we tried afforded
her just as little relief as the first, and
I really do not know what we should
have done if we had not read how
Cuticura cured a similar case. I pur-
chased Cuticura Soap, Cuticura Oint-
ment, and Cuticura Pills, and before
the Ointment was three-quarters
finished every trace of the disease was
gone. It really seemed like magic.
Her hair is coming on nicely, and I
still apply the Cuticura Ointment as I
find it increases the growth wonder-
fully. Mrs. T. W. Hyde, 1, Ongar

Business. Robbery, etc.
The nation-blighting squatter who advertises
for a married couple and stipulates “ no encumbrance”
evidently has a relation in the rag- business in S’Africa.
The following is part of his iniquitous advertisement in a
Bloemfontein paper :
“Wanted, a Smart Salesman for a General Business,
must have a knowledge of all branches, including soft
goods.
“ He must be of strictly sober habits, active and push-
ing ; be a good stock-keeper and understand window
dressing, and also have a knowledge of book-keeping (by
dou’. le entry).
“ Must be thoroughly trustworthy, capable and
courteous, speak both English and Dutch, and be un-
married. ”
The time will arrive when an indignant Law will leap
upon the man who insists upon celibacy as a necessary
qualification for a prospective employee. In the present
instance the only fair excuse for the marriage-prohibi-
tion is that the store is situated in a region where the
customers are so wild that a white woman and children
wouldn’t be safe. In that case, however, the art of
window-dressing would be superfluous ; and, as the advt.
specifies window-dressing and not machine-gunnery, this
paper concludes that the likely customers are moderately
tame.

“ Sbay ” : Pablo Prawnopulos has been hard
hitby Sydney City Council’s action in takingup the selling
of the fisherman’s harvest. Pablo and co. were the per-
sons who really robbed the fisherman. Being the prin-
cipal buyers, they could make agents sell, reserve, or
withhold fish to suit them. If the agent refused, Pablo
and co. would boycott him. The Sydney Council doesn’t
care a plate of fried-fish for the Dago ring, and
sells straight-out, in small or large lots, to
any comer who has the cash, greatly to the
advantage of the fishermen. Pablo’s cousin, Antonio
Peanutto, who keeps the fruit stall, is also strik-
ing trouble, though, unfortunately, it isn’t the right
kind of trouble. It is, in fact, Fat Wong. Fat has given
up lumping baskets, and has taken shops in Manly,
Oxford-street, and elsewhere. As Fat W. is often an
orchardist, and mostly a gardener, he has the bulge on
Antonio, who is only adealer. And Wong’s grower-friends
stick to him in preference to Antonio. The agitation in
favor of municipal fruit auctions betokens further trouble
for the Peanutto ring that robs orchardist and consumer
wholesale. And it is highly desirable that that trouble
should arrive quickly, because Fat Wong isn’t a desirable
person to encourage, even at the expense of Antonio
Peanutto.

The average Foreign-trader has queer ideas as
to what constitutes sweating. A big Flinders-lane(Melb.)
warehouse advertised lately for a “young man, salary
12s. 6d. weekly,” and was deeply pained when the Age
referred to the firm as a shocking example of sweating.
The manager explained indignantly that the salary was
quite munificent for the job, and twice as much as
other Foreign-traders were paying. Anyway, it wasn’t
sweating, for all the man had to do was to work a lift
for 10 hours a day, with a chance of breaking his neck
thrown in. Besides, he had a chance of rising (in the
lift), and the pride of working for a big firm of Foreign-
traders. Altogether, he was a fortunate young man to
get such a job, and it was perfectly ridiculous to talk of
sweating.

“A.E.M.”: Toiling obscurely in an Adelaide
bootshop there is a young man in whom burns the spark
of commercial genius. When he decided to go into the
footwear line he knew nothing of the business, and had
no references of any sort. Yet he turned up undauntedly
at a leading shop, and asked for a job as salesman. The
boss declined firmly. The other protested. “ Let me
serve the first customer that comes in and I’ll prove my
value,” he said. To this the proprietor ultimately agreed.
A man entered and asked for a pair of bootlaces. The
would-be assistant gave him the laces, and pointed out
suavely that if he took a pair of eighteen and ninepennv
boots with them he’d achieve the laces for nothing and a
financial coup into the bargain. The customer said he
didn’t want any boots. With an importunity so courteous
as to be charming, the job-seeker told him that it really
wasn’t a case of want them—it was a matter of having a
pair on hand for a rainy day. The customer swore that
he didn’t care an asterisk about rainy days. He refused
point blank to take the boots. The other demonstrated
to him that his attitude was palpably foolish, and offered
to re-sole and heel the boots he was wearing for ss. 6d.
The customer swore horribly, and attempted to escape.
He was, however, plainly weakening at this stage. Ulti-
mately he left the shop wearing a pair of new
boots and a dazed expression, and carrying a pair of
carpet slippers. He left his old boots to be mended.
The boss, who had watched the proceedings in a stupefied
state, closed immediately with the new man at an ex-
tensive screw. And the very first pay day that came
round the capable salesman sought out his bosom pal
who had collaborated with him in the boot-vending act,
and handed to him a quantity of bullion. For though
cunning he was not ungrateful.

“Itan ”: If the small-goods farmer gets a
municipal market to agent his stuff in Sydney, it should
be on the understanding that he is made honest, too, in
his methods of packing; made methodical by com-
pulsory grading; made to absolutely keep out his
diseased fruit. These markets should cut both ways—
protect the consumer as well as the producer. Even
then the retail trouble will have to be struggled with.
Quite a few of these farmers could struggle with it, and
aid themselves a heap in the process, if they would just
take to delivering their stuff to regular customers, thus
helping the consumer to escape the clutches of the Dago
retailer.
* * *
“Boswell”: Undoubtedly the city fruit-
niarkets should be under municipal control. But who is
to control Private Enterprise in the retail trade, and
when is he going to begin ? The shameless extortion
practised by retail fruiterers all over Australia prompts
the query. It is rampant enough in the great cities
which have orchard suburbs ; but when the wayfarer
strikes one of the provincial towns he begins to imagine
himself in some beleaguered city, buying famine rations.
And this in a country which produces almost every fruit
grown on tree or vine. Along the Northern railway in
N. S. Wales it is a common thing to be asked l|d. for a
peach, and the same for apples and pears, with grapes at
9d. the lb., although all these fruits grow near by, and
the producer perforce supplies the rapacious “trade”
dirt cheap. It is characteristic of the Dago that he pre-
fers to do a small trade at 500 per cent, profit rather than
have a large turnover at, say, 50 per cent. In the
country towns all hands would materially benefit if the
municipality took full charge of the fruit business, and
traded in one large central shop. A hitherto fruitless
public would find fruit much cheaper and nicer than
medicine ; the grower would get a fair price ; and half a
dozen un-business persons in each town would find their
! n.itural level in a pick and shovel job.

“Trotters” :-My own view is that Germany
is determined to possess Holland, with the Dutch
colonies. Java, Dutch New Guinea, Sumatra,
Uutch Borneo, Celebes, and other islands of
the Archipelago are in the programme. In
this ambition all the other Powers appear to
stand in the way—not only Britain and France
particularly, but also the United States, China,
Japan, Australia, and even Russia, which is firmly
against any German increase of strength. The
German axiom is that all the Rhine below Switzer-
land is the empire’s property. Rotterdam is
becoming quite Germanised. Here, on the Meuse,
is held to be the business mouth of the Dutch
Rhine. Another mouth is the Scheldt, which serves
Antwerp, in Belgium. The Germans lose n» chance
of collaring interests in Antwerp. The Dutch
Eastern Archipelago has about 36,000,000 people,
of whom 26,000,000 are in Java, including 200,000
whites. The world is no doubt a loser through
these countries not being in the hands of a strong
Power. The vast island of Sumatra cannot be
developed, because the Dutch are unable to conquer
the Achinese. One may wildly speculate on a
struggle between France and Germany for Belgium
and Holland ; but even if Germany got Holland,
the United States, Japan, China, Britain and
France would be up in arms against it getting the
Dutch colonies.

TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is ttt
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary belief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Oup modern medical system Is a foolish system. ? We practically pay
our doctors to keep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
BUT ON OUR SICKNESS! . . . To-day very little Is known of medicine
and its use. The wisest doctor can do but little more than clear out
the system or accelerate the action of the heart. When he has done these
thing's he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up new energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Life; you can have
no WeaKness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheumatism, Indi»
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and
strength to every organ, and

“ F.C.” : Not one of the obituary notices
of Algernon Charles Swinburne mentions the
reason why he was not allowed to succeed Tenny-
son as Poet Laureate—the savage verses addressed
to the late Alexander of Russia what time that
unprincipled autocrat was breaking his pledges tb
his people. Writer remembers only one line,
“ Smite ye then, and send him down the way his
father went.” Of course polite society couldn’t
stand that, so Alfred Austin got the billet, though
not the honor. Somebody said, a while back, that
Rent’s ex-Minister Swinburne was a distant rela-
tive of the poet. Perhaps, the long gas-man will
remember these cheerful verses.
“ Mallacoota ” —his disloyal remarks :
The comic-opera shows which go on around these
utterly superfluously State Governors occasionally take a
tour through the Hush to fill the natives with joy. J. Car-
michael, Victoria’s vice-regal appendix, takes himself
rather seriously. He went down through the wilds of
Croajingalong lately with a little entourage. One im-
ported official, who acts as Deputy-Ornainent in chief,
made such an impression on the pig farmers that Qroa-
jingalong hasn’t closed up its mouth yet. Even Norman
Lindsay could hardly do justice to the Deputy-Ornament’s
legs, which he clothed constantly in bright yellow
gaiters. The Dep.-O. fascinated me. I used to follow him
round at a respectful distance, just to hear him issue
orders to the Second Deputy-Ornament. When he broke
the portentous information, “ Breakfust at half-past six
to-morrow morning,” he did it with the air and
manner and utterance of a General of Division
ordering a battalion to occupy Spion liop. Na-
poleon at Waterloo sending in the Old Guard for a
I ist cut was nothing to Snipe Legs, commanding the
Hx.’s hot water. Altogether the Deputy-Ornament was
the best part of the amusing show. The school kids
about Genoa and the Oarin Kiver now practice walking
across the paddocks with their'leg's in a graceful arch
and order their juniors l to fetch up the evening cowdiing
for the mosquito smoke with a dignity of manner calcu-
lated to keep a double hitch in the “ silken bonds.”-
Tooth— lie is now Lucas-Tooth—.the
.Sydney brewer, who mostly spends his life in
England, has been, on .a flying visit to Australia.
Before going back to the Cold Country he founded
a scholarship for Australian-born youths who
wish to be educated for the Anglican Church, 1 and
learn to read out to the congregation that “this
Bawabbas was a wobbah.” The scholarship'is
worth £3OO a year, and, true to his Absentee in-
stincts, beer-builder Tooth has made it tenable
only at -an English University—Oxford or- Cam-
bridge. An Australian.Univarsity.training is of
no use to Tooth—who is now Lucas-Tooth. Yet
all the terraces of Beer which represent the Tooth
wealth were made in this country.
By “ Vigilant” :
Premier Wade, of N.S.W., is not the only Australian
politician of the present day who has been burned in
'-fflgy. Edward Wittenoom, of Westralia, was similarly
honored. Wittenoom was the author of the ten-foot limit
in alluvial mining which created, a small, revolution on
ihe Ivalgoorlie goldfields 12 years ago. John Forrest con-
veniently fled to Melbourne and escaped tfle trouble;; mid
Wittenoom, then Minister of Mines and Acting Premier, '
was left to face the storm alone. Sometimes his effigy
was burned, but more often .the miners -hanged- -it with a
ten-foot drop. For a Jong time Edward was the best-
hated man in the West, and the name of “Ten Foot
Ned” still sticks to him. Which’ is rather hard on a
mild-mannered man who wouldn’t blow a fly off bis coat
without apologising, and .paying .compensation, .for. ,dis-.
turbance. Wittenoom has been in and out of Westralia’s
Legislative Council for the past i 25 years. He was
Minister of Mines from 1894 to 1898, and Chen went to
England as Agent-General for three years. He. is at pre-
sent managing director for Dalgety’s, a big squatter, a
racehorse owner, a K.C.M.G., an M.L.C., and various
other things. As a politician he does the right thing
seldom and the wrong thing affably.
Joe Kookaburra remarked the other night
that Federal Attorney-General Hughes in com-
bating his arguments had “degenerated into
personalities as usual.” As far as Mr. Hughes’
published utterances are concerned, the only per-
sonal remark was the retort, “ Mr. Cook’s com-
plaint is practically that we have not changed our
policy. Had we changed ours as often as Mr.
Cook has changed his, we would no doubt have
given satisfaction.” This is certainly a per-
sonality, but one that is perfectly Parliamentary
and legitimate, and, moreover, absolutely true, as
anybody who has followed Joe’s career must
admit. Contrast it with the attacks that Cook
himself has made on Hughes on the floor of the
House of Representatives!” “You’re a con-
temptible little rat!” “You’re a dirty little
rat !” etc., etc. When it comes to personalities
of the push type, Cook is second only to—well,
his name need not be mentioned. Call him
Alderman Mudd !
“ Oby ” : Ifc is nob so marvellous that
Australia leads the way in Socialistic legislation.
In its earliest days the hand of the Socialist
trained it to grow and flourish for the public, as
distinguished from the private, good. Governor
Phillip considered on one occasion that the public
were not getting a fair deal in the fish supply, so
he issued an order appropriating to Government
use “ all the private boats in the settlement.”. He
worked the boats and divided the produce fairly.
At another time people ran short of pigs, arid
private owners made a corner in pork ; but they
counted'withput the Governor. His Ex. issued
an order appropriating to the Government use
“ all the hogs in the settlement,” thereby squelch-
ing the corner in one act. Similarly, fruitgrowers
laid themselves out one season for a bit of sharp
practice against the public, but the Governor
appropriated all the fruit in the gardens around
Sydney for that season. A benevolent despotism
has points.
The Australian capital that has been prevented
finding investment in its own country, owing to
the lack of a decent tariff, begins to go abroad to d velop
other lands. And the latest example is that of The Aus-
tral-Mala-y Rubber Co., a projected concern of 40.000
shares at £1 each. Of this number 10,000 will be issued
fully paid up, and 80,000 in terms of payment of 2s. 6d.
on applio ition, 2s. fid. on allotment, and the balance by
calls not exceeding 2s. 6d per share in any one period of
six months. The company proposes to acquire from
the Southern Cross Rubber Co. and Ivan Cameron
Fraser, on a lease of 999 Mahometan years, cer-
tain rubber-growing lands in the State of Kelantan,
on the river of the same name, in the Malay Peninsula.
The provisional directors are S. A. Laidle.v, A. R. Minter,
Hon. T. Waddell, M.L.A., J. St. Vincent Welch, and
J. Fairlie Bell, of Kelantan. The solicitors are an old
and well-respected Sydney firm, Messrs. Minter. Simpson
and Co., while the co.’s cash will be in the safe keeping
of the Union Bank of Australia. Rubber-growing is a
profitable business, as all-the world over th- demand is in
exc ss of the supply, and it*.use is being daily extended.
Another thing' that should make rubber-growing
profitable • is .that the supplies .of wild rubber
in the jungles of Africa arid South America have
been almost- entirely destroyed by the vandalism
of the'collectors' in the -past; and now the result- in the
shape of a dearth is striking the world hard. Rubber
can afford to fall vastly ‘in price' before it ceases to be a
profitable crop ; and when it gets cheaper its use will be
indefinitely extended. It is to be regretted that there
are not enterprises in Australia to absorb all its capital ;
but till the country gets a decent tariff Australian money
Will continue to flow away to develop other countries.
This is the first rubber co. to be worked with purely
Australian capital; but more than likely it is merely the
first of a considerable rush.*

The crowd which is clamoring for the
presentation of a Dreadnought to Britain has
already got to work on the N.S.W. Public Ser-
vice. The Department of Works has been
rushed with a circular signed “W. L. Vernon,
Government Architect,” and “T. R. Steel,
Accountant,” suggesting that the officers of the
Department should give a day’s pay towards the
movement. And the ill-paid public servant who
is trying to maintain a wife and three children on
less than £3 a week, doesn’t greatly enthuse over
the idea. It is a great deal more difficult for him
to give a day’s pay than it would be for Walter
Hall to give three months’ income, for he couldn’t
part with even one day’s revenue without depriv-
ing his wife and children of some of the actual
necessaries of life, while Walter Hall could give
£lOO,OOO without having one course the less at
dinner, or sacrificing one drink or one shilling
cigar. In cases like these the Public Service
seems to be regarded as a convenient victim, but
it is a low-down business, and one that deserves
to be suppressed.
“Westerner ” writes :
A notable example of the thrift beloved by the daily
papers is Sam Copley, of Westralia. Sam started life as
a barber’s boy, in a small shop in a Lancashire (England)
mining town. By always living on less than he earned —
though that was mighty little—he saved enough to buy
out his boss’s business before he was 20. Sam proceeded
to astonish the natives by opening the shop at four
o’clock in the morning, in order to catch the miners going
on shift. There were no early-closing or early-opening
laws in those days, and the youthful barber prospered
exceedingly. The opposition of his fellow-tradesmen to
bis revolutionary methods finally succeeded in driving
capital out of the country. Sam sailed for Frenmntle
(W.A.), where he started in his old business, adding
“finance” as a side-line. The side-line soon shunted
the original business off the rails, and Copley
blossomed forth as a big dealer in money. All the profits
went into land, and land again, and still more land—on
the ridiculously easy terms the Westralian Government
extends to the squatters. At the present time Copley is
lord over more acres than any other man in the West.
His areas extend right across theNor’-West, and well into
the Northern Territory; and he boasts that lie could
drop the Cold Country down in a corner of his little bit
of soil and nobody would ever be able to find it. Mean-
time the old barber’s boy is a big segment in the gilded
meat ring. And it is a profitable business being a meat
king in the West.

A Six Months’
Old Sore
Cured in Less than a Week.
PROOF POSITIVE AT ERSKINEVILLE.
There is some curative property in Rexona not
to be found in other ointments. Mrs. John
MacDonald, of 1 Harold Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, makes this statement, and in so doing
she has struck the keynote. That is precisely why
it cured her little daughter’s ear when other
ointments proved quite useless. Read what this
lady says :—•
“My little daughter Veronica, aged three years,
for six months suffered from a bad and obstinate
sore behind the ear, and nothing had any healing
effect upon it. I tried Zinc Ointment, Boracic
and other ointments, but all these were of no use.
Then I tried Rexona Ointment. There is some
curative property in this ointment not to be found
in other ointments, for after the first application
the sore showed signs of healing. The sore was
about the size of a shilling, and was just at the
base of the ear. After a few applications it was
reduced to the size of a sixpence, then it went to
the size of a three-penny bit, and in a few hours
after it disappeared altogether, leaving a clean
skin underneath. I look upon the work Rexona
has done as wonderful, for it cured this six months’
old sore in less than a week, and after all sorts of
treatment had proved quite useless.”
Rexona is a reliable remedy for all eruptions
and irritations of the Skin, Eczema, Pimples,
Sores, Chilblains, Chapped Hands, Sciatica,
Itching or Bleeding Piles, Cuts, Burns, Bruises,
Scalds, Bad Legs, Stings of Insects, and all kinds
of inflammation. Rexona is sold only in triangular
pots at Is. 6d. and 3s. All Chemists and Stores
will supply it, or it will be sent post free upon
receipt of the price by the Laxo-
Tonic Pill Co., 15 O’Connell
Street, Sydney, N.S.W.

The maddening smart of a burn or scald (and the fact that the action of
the air is injurious) calls for the immediate application of Zam-Buk.
Keep a pot of this soothing first-aid in the most-get-at-able place. The kettle
may boil over or lurch from the hob any moment, and there is daily risk of similar
mishaps to men, women and children alike.
Lighting one’s pipe isn’t always safe and painless; lifting dishes from the
oven and washing up have their own warm surprises; and the youngsters learn
many painful lessons about playing with fire.
1 burnt child dreads the fire ’’—but if mother
nas applied Zam-Buk it loves this pure healing balm
ever afterwards. Zam-Buk is so soothing and cool-
ing, and besides subduing pain and inflammation it
helps to grow new skin—a unique property which is
especially valuable in injuries of this kind. Much
tissue is often destroyed, and those who have watched
a burn or scald heal up under Zam-Buk’s beneficent
influence, have often marvelled at the wonderful
work resulting from the application of a balm which
works hand in hand with Nature so harmoniously and
effectively. New skin appears and spreads over the
destroyed surface like new rows of houses erected by an
expert builder, and soon the part is quite whole and
sound again.
A Housewife's Scalded
Foot Healed.
MissF. Douglas, of Sussex Street, Lower N. Ade-
laide, writes “ Some six months ago, while engaged
in the kitchen, I had the misfortune to scald my foot. I
applied different ointments and so-called healers, but at
the end of a month my foot still remained bad. One day
I bought a pot of Zam-Buk Balm, and after a few appli-
cations my foot showed signs of healing, and in a little
while it was completely cured. lam exceedingly grateful
for what Zam-Buk has done for me, and can recommend
it as a handy household healer.”

sions, Burns, Scalds, Pimples,

Storm Children.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[DREAM of the plashing of fountains,
I think of the sough of the sea.
When the little brown brooks in the moun-
tains
Are touching wild harpstrings for me.
With their sibilant quavers and trebles,
And lulls ’neath the barren rock’s shade,
Their banjo song over the pebbles,
The bass of a headlong cascade.
The glad waters eddy and glisten
By crag upon precipice piled,
And the hoar mournful heights seem to listen
Like Eld to the song of a child—
A child of mad storms that have slaken
Their lust with the peaks e’er they go ;
By those swelling hill-breasts gently taken,
And suckled with sunshine and snow.
Singing on, they are joined by their brothers;
Racing on over boulder and bar ;
Behind are the laps of their mothers,
The Ocean awaits them afar.
Boiling round where the rock-fangs have gripped
them,
Live cauldrons of scintillant pearls,
To fall, where the landslip has tripped them,
Honey-brown like goddess’s curls.
And welcome, thrice welcome, the shade is
Of bush over-arching a pool !
Ah, soft as the sigh of a maid is
The hymn where the mosses grow cool!
So sylvan, sequestered, beguiling, *
So still, looking down, you could swear,
By the way the clear waters seem smiling,
The white naked nymphs have been there.
Smug streets by the Pharisee trodden !
Sad city bedevilled and dun !
Smoked skies in your raiment tear-sodden !
Yon lack-lustre eye of the sun !
Then turn we to fern-fronds a-quiver,
By crags whence Immensity spills,
Where the little brown brooks to the river
Go down in a song from the hills.

Slimmy the Willm’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
jy KITH his shirt open at the neck, and
V W his damp hair standing as he had
ruffled it with an impatient hand,
Slimmy Swifte sat in the heart of a ton of explo-
sive, banked about him in 50-pound boxes. He
took a deep breath, and reached down a battered
ledger, opening it upon the raised packing-case
before him.
Already, since five o’clock o’ the morning, he
had watered a mob of 30 assorted horses, and
given them their scant fodder, and mended the
crazy fence which enclosed them, and cut a new
supply of green saplings for the roofing of their
airy quarters in the bush yard ; and he had blue-
stoned a dozen sore backs and shoulders, and used
the currycomb on more than one unsightly hide.
Slimmy had encountered a combination job, and
his troubles and duties were many. One of his
troubles was the keeping of books—Slimmy hated
keeping books.
He uncorked the ink and tried a new nib, and
then, as he began to rummage among a pile of
papers, a heavy footstep sounded at the door of
the shack.
“ Team cornin’! ” grunted the intruder, cheer-
fully. It was Joe, the mine-blacksmith’s striker,
come up from the forge in the gully with a string
of steeled picks. Joe slung the bunch of metal
down with a bang beside the stack of fracteur-
boxes, and turned to go, with a black hand sweep-
ing across his smutted brow.
Slimmy started up with a curse, banged his
ledger shut, and came out of the shack. He
stared down the road to where a cloud of white
dust marked the slow progress of the 16-horse
team.
Joe glanced humorously at the waggon and then
at the perspiring Slimmy.
“Like a job strikin’?” he grinned, and made
off down the foot track, with Slimmy shaking a
despairing head as the waggon bumped at the
crossing.
Further supplies of gelignite were aboard, with
galvanised iron, and iron in bars and bundles.
“ Got enough fracteur t’ break th’ back o’ the
Peninsula!” he groaned, and went disgustedly
out to the weighbridge.
O’Hagan’s contract with the company was to
deliver the goods at Burke’s Creek. O’Hagan
was not a generous soul, and so, to save the goods
from being dumped in glorious confusion all about
the shack, Slimmy toiled with the offsider to take
off the cases and carry them inside. It was dry
weather, and so the iron stayed out in the sun.
While the waggon was being unloaded, O’Hagan
went off to the “office” on the hill to collect his
cash, and came swaggering back as the last of the
loading was deported.
With the gnawings of a healthy hunger hard at
his midst, Slimmy breathed a relieved sigh as
O’Hagan went off with his empty waggon.
“An’ don’t come back for a month!” he
shouted, as the teamster strode at the brake.
O’Hagan shook his red beard at him, spitefully,
and showed his jagged, yellow teeth.
“ Do yer good if yer saw me seven days a week !
Bit o’ toil’s a good lurk fer a young man like yous
—nothin’ t’ do b’t loaf round-’n’ kill flies ! Toil—
’ard toil, like drivin’ ’orses ! ”
O’Hagan whirled the brake on, and clattered
down hill.
“Toil!” moaned Slimmy. “Toil!” and went
fiercely on, stacking hot iron.
At midday he retired to his camp down-creek,
where his mate met him with an amiable salute.
Slimmy grabbed a tin of sardines and stared at
it disconsolately.
“ Wish a bloke had your easy job, Tiger ! ” he
said, fervently.
He ripped the lid off the fish and turned the
~-n over to the other, who had cut two chunks of
bread in readiness to receive the relish. The
billy was boiling, and Dickson got up and made
the tea.
Slimmy, squatting in the shade, turned his gaze
along the track down which O’ Hagan’s team had
come, and, as Dickson handed him his pannikin,
he got hastily to his feet again. Dickson dropped
the tea and splashed himself.
Slimmy made no apology, but made a disgusted
sound, and once more squatted.
“Jago’s team,” he sighed, “ with six hundred
and forty tons o’ brickbats, cornin' down to fill the
company’s aching void.”
This time, as Slimmy found after a quick lunch,
the loading was iron bolts, done up in boxes of a
hundredweight, and more fracteur.
Slimmy finished unloading the goods at knock-
off time. Jago and his lieutenant assisted at
intervals, while Slimmy himself found the work
protracted by various imperative demands in
other directions.
When his nominal day’s toil was concluded, he
still had a pile of fracteur to dispose of, the goods
having been dumped by Jago, without remark, at
one end of the shack.
Then Masters, the very big boss, came by. By
this time Slimmy was a thing of dust and bitters,
his grimy hair streaked into his eyes, and his face
lined with grime.
“What’s the fracteur doin’in the sun?” de-
manded Masters. Masters was wearing a white
linen coat and riding puttees. He looked well-fed
and leisured.
Slimmy made no reply. He bent down with a
despairing gesture, grabbed a case and began to
carry it into the shack.
The boss went away.
Later on, Slimmy climbed on a decayed hack
and took twenty-seven horses down the creek to
water, and came back and gave them a taste of
feed, with a dribble of corn in the bottom of each
box. It was a two-meal company, and small
meals at that. Slimmy felt sorry for these horses,
and went and bluestoned a few more sore
shoulders.
He felt sorry for himself very soon, with familiar
pangs coming again to the pit of his stomach.
At length he went slouching off to tea.
Afterwards he sewed his blueys, which had
parted at the seams ; and he and Dickson had a
smoke, and sat awhile, watching the gorgeous sun
set over the Gulf.
Towards ten o’clock, long after the last timber-
drav had rattled down the bouldered track, when
the tired teams were finally disposed of by their
drivers for the night, and cooped upfor an early start
on the morrow, Slimmy took his hurricane lan-
tern and set out upon a parting tour of inspection.
As he entered the enclosure, and walked down the
row of stalls, a dark figure came lurching across !
the stony crossing below the shack.
It was Ted Edwards, who was camped out at
the Gluepot to keep a well-paid eye on the con-
tracts in that quarter. Ted was unable to keep a
straight line, and rolled up to the fence with a
wide action that was not at all dignified. He
gripped the top sapling and made a wild leap into
the air. The sapling turned on its stand of
timber, and Ted landed with a thump in the dust
of the yard.
A team-horse snorted with excitement near-by,
and Ted scrambled away towards the middle of
the enclosure without waiting to rise to his feet.
He saw Slimmy, and got up unsteadily.
“Say, h’lo ! H’lo, Shlimmy ! Pick me out—
pick me out me ’orse, ol’ boy, will y’ ? D’y’ mind
tindin’—fin’in’ me ’orse for me? I put ’im in ’ere
b’fore—’fore th’ shun wen’ down, an’—now I—
now I ” .
He stepped forward and peered uncertainly up
and down the line of quiet horses, dimly seen in
the starlight.
“ I can’t shee ’im ! P’r’aps—’raps this’s ’im ! ”
He laid a hand on the nearest sliprail and
lifted it out, letting it fall with a bang.
Slimmy came up in a hurry.
“Here, I’ll find your horse,” he growled,
putting up the rail the other had slipped.
He dropped another, further up.
“ Gome on ! ” he said, sweetly, and the horse
turned with his tail to the feed-box, showing
a white eye and lowering an ear.
“ Come on ! ” said Slimmy again, in a hurt tone,
and the horse stepped out, while Slimmy, with
the hurricane lamp slung on his arm, ran a
friendly hand up and put the bit in.
“Find your own iron,” he ordered, and Ted
groped in the off-side darkness, with his back to
the horse’s tail, and clutched a stirrup, and felt
back to put a hand on the neck of his mount.
Instead of a mane he felt a smooth, bewildering
back, and withdrew his foot hastily.
“ W’y,” he complained, bitterly, “you got th’
bloo’ ’orse th’—th’ wrong way roun’! You got
th’ ’orse—th’ ’orse th’—th’ wrong way ”
“P’r’aps,” said Slimmy, sepulchrally, from the
gloom at the horse’s head. “P’r’aps, if y’ came
’round on y’r right side an’ tried t’ climb on that
way instead of over the horse’s head—p’r’aps y’
might be able t’ crawl up ! Try, anyhow.”
Ted came round and caught Slimmy’s hand, the
one which carried the lantern, and held it aloft,
wavering.
“Jush sho!” he complained, still bitterly.
“ Jush sho ! ”
Then his feelings overcame him.
“Shlimmy!” he groaned, tragically, “Shlimmy !
If me po-pore ol’ mother cou’ shee me now ! Me
pore ol’ mother, thousan’s ’n’ thousan’s ’n’—’n’
thousan’s o’ miles away ! ”
He buried his face on Slimmy’s shoulder,
shedding a tear.
“ Thousan’s an’ thous ”
Slimmy shook him off, angrily.
“ Damn y’ pore ol’ mother!” he snarled,
fiercely. “ Get on y’ pore ol’ sufferin’ nag, ’n’ get
out t’ camp ! You’ll be sorry enough with y’r
head in th’ morn’, without being sorry all over me
now ! Come on ! ” He grabbed the bridle and
held the horse round while Ted made a dive at
the mane and the stirrup, and flung himself
sprawling across the saddle.
“Y’ know, Shlimmy,” he muttered, bending
his head to peer over his shoulder, “y’ know,
y’re a willin’ sort er—willin’ bloke, ol’ boy ! ”
Slimmy’s voice came indignantly out of the
darkness.
“Slimmy!” he yelled. “Slimmy! Slimmy
to a drunken rotter like you ! Gerrout ! ”
He ran to the rails at the corner of the yard,
and flung them down.
“Gerrout !” he shouted again, and smacked the
horse loudly on the flank as the other pulled out
of the enclosure.
There was a cry of sorrow and wrath, and the
horseman cleared wildly down the track and was
swallowed up in the night.
Slimmy put up the rails, and then went back to
his seat among the fracteur. He stood his lantern
upon a case above him, and once more reached
down the big ledger and opened it. One look,
and he slammed it again, with a deep sigh, and
pulled out his pipe.
“Toil be jiggered! ” he said, violently, and
leaned back against the fracteur-boxes, putting
his feet out of the window.

The easiest time, the right time, the only safe time to pro-
tect yourself against fatal kidney complications is when
the first sign appears, for kidney complaint comes on un-
noticed, and it is bound to end fatally if neglected. Take
no risks with your health, but begin with Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills at the first sign of anything wrong. Doan’s
Pills are a special medicine and a sure cure for every dis-
order of the kidneys or connective system.
Sydney Women Cured.
ARTARMON.
Mrs. E. A. Bruce, Broughton Road,
Artarmon, Sydney, says : —“lsuffered
for a long time with severe pains in my
back. They were so bad that I could
scarcely move about. Rest was out of
the question. I would be tossing about
all night, moaning with the pain. I
could not bend my back, and I had to
neglect my work. I was really very ill,
and would be confined to bed for days at
a time. I saw Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills advertised as a cure for backache,
and got a box. After a few doses I got
relief, and then gradually I got better,
until I was quite cured. There is no
doubt about it being a cure, for it is
three years since I stopped taking the
pills, and I’ve not had the backache all
that time.”
LESCHHARDT.
Mrs. John Lawson, Brennan Street,
Leichhardt, Sydney, says : —“ I can
strongly recommend Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills for curing pains in the
small of the back. A member of my
family was suffering severely, and it
was difficult, to move about at all. I
blame sitting too close at work for
causing the trouble. The pills effected
a permanent cure, for there is no sign
of the ailment now.
Mrs. Lawson makes a second state-
ment six years later : —“ The above is
quite true, and time has proved that
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills not
only cure, but cure permanently.
There would be less suffering in the
world if people only knew the value
of this remedy.”
DOWLING STREET.
Mrs. E. Chapman, 133 Dowling
Street, Sydney, says “My mother
suffered with severe pains across the
back, and in her legs. For six months
she was very bad, and some days
would not be able to get up at all. She
tried a lot of remedies, but they did
her no good. We saw Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills advertised, and
thought we would get some and give
them a trial. After taking the first
half-box, we knew they were good, for
she felt a little better, and from that
on the improvement was marked, and
eight boxes completed the cure. She
is now splendid, and can get about
easily. It is twelve months since her
cure, and during that time she has not
needed to take a single pill. We feel
sure that she is cured for good.”
CSTY.
Mrs. Hannah Davis, 97 Common-
wealth Street, Sydney, says:—“T used
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for aches
and pains in the limbs, which I fancied
were caused by kidney trouble. The
pains had troubled me for years, defy-
ing all treatment. I found it very
difficult to get up and down stairs, and
fits of giddiness, which often came over
me, made it more distressing. Some-
times I would be laid up. Soon after
I started using Doan’s Pills relief came,
and when I had taken six boxes the
aches and pains and giddiness had dis-
appeared.”
Three years later, when asked about
her cure, Mrs. Davis says:—“Yes, I
am still quite well; none of the dis-
tressing symptoms mentioned above
have ever returned.”

The Engineers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fTI HERE’S an Army Corps that’s marching
round this planet battle-blasted—
There’s a Legion grim, gigantic, shaking
empires ’neath its tread ;
It has nailed the flag of Progress to the world’s
star-touching mast-head
And the continents are vassals—vassals toiling
for their bread ;
It has scaled the tall Sierras —there by gradients
and tunnels
Rolls science and its legion round the harnessed
hemispheres;
Hear it roaring down the Rockies—hear its
thund’rous engine-funnels—
Hail ! boss band of earthly fighters—Hail!
triumphant Engineers !
With theodolite and crowbar—with the monkey-
wrench and spanner,
Ye have hasped the lands together as with
bonds outlasting steel;
Dynamiting ’yond Zambesi, ye have ’stablished
Trade’s tall banner—
And have crushed the bones of Pharaoh ’neath
To-day’s material heel !
Never ocean but ye tamed it with a bit of master-
ing iron ;
Never mountain but ye climbed it with your
drills and coils of fuse ;
By the coal-heaps of Las Palmas hear the tramp-
ship’s screaming syren—
Hail! ye spanner-sceptred Caesars—Hail! ye
kings in greasy “ blues ! ”
Down the grades ye drive in triumph—hear the
roaring wheels and pistons,
Hear the cars clack out their chorus as they
thunder through the night;
Spurning space, ye link the cities with the corpse
of slaughtered Distance—
Ye have canned the vivid lightning, weaving
storm-breath into light !
Dynamos in concert whirring lift a song of timbre
splendid—
Lift a chant of toil, of conquest over lands and
furthest seas;
Cranks a-throb send forth an anthem glory-noted,
battle-blended—
Hail ! ye modern Alexanders—Plamilcars in
dungarees !
Moves the shuttle of the ages—Carthage rots,
and Rome no longer
Holds dominion o’er the ocean with the galley
and trireme;
Newer Powers ride on the waters —ride embattled,
mailed, far stronger—
For the Engineers have built them floating forts
of steel and steam !
And the artisans have launched them—launched
their mighty sea volcanoes—
Deep within each looming Dreadnought throbs
a brain that thinks and steers ;
And the earth may heed the lesson that the pride
of fallen Spain knows—
Hail ! ye arbiters of Empire—hail! ye nameless
Engineers !
Ye are lords of fate and fortune—ye are masters
of To-morrow,
For the hand that rules the engines throws the
dice of Destiny;
So the land whose ships are laggards bows its
head in bitter sorrow
When the nations hurl their navies ’gainst each
other on the sea.
’Mid the steam ye fight your battle, gripping fast
the reins of power—
Tearing seas and States asunder with your roar-
ing shafts and screws :
His Nibs may jerk proud signals from the shell-
scarred conning-tower,
But the ships of war are driven by the men in
greasy “blues ” !
VICTORIA.
GRANT HERVEY.
The Referee.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
J round this narrative at all, its chief
character should have been one of three
things—drunk, jealous or mad. And the
story must stand raw-edged ; for he was none of
them.
It would, in the first place, have cost far too
much to get him intoxicated, because he was
capable of standing twice as much drink as any of
his acquaintances. And as his own money was
regularly “ blewed,” sailor-fashion, as soon as he
got it, he couldn’t have contributed anything to-
wards the drunk unless the event happened on
the first of the month. And this event didn’t.
Secondly, he was never in love during the 23
years of his life. And thirdly, a resistible im-
pulse, whatever its nature, can hardly be termed
madness.
And the impulse that came to Hjalmar Bjorn-
sen, the Norwegian fireman at the Stanton Downs
Freezing Works, was certainly resistible. That it
was so is proved by the fact that he fought it off
for a good four hours, and that fight should stand
well to his credit, for it was a stiff one.
Briefly, we have to deal with two men, a Corliss
engine, a water-tube boiler, and an impulse.
When or how that impulse first came to him
Hjalmar could not accurately gauge, although he
reviewed each incident and, as far as possible, each
thought, during the hours between his coming on
duty and its arrival.
They were freezing rabbits for the export trade,
and, busy as the big factory was in daytime, at
night, except for his fireman, the engineer in charge
was absolutely alone.
Coulson was “on ” this week. The Norwegian
liked the good-natured young fellow above the
ruck of his companions, and he liked them all
well enough. Yet he contemplated wrecking
him and his engine together. That was what
puzzled Hjalmar so. Had it been anyone he de-
tested —the overbearing manager, for instance—
he might in some vague fashion have understood.
Blindly he groped for a reason.
The boiler-room had a door leading into the
engine-room ; but the two apartments were quite
distinct, and it often happened that the whole
night would pass without the two men on duty
seeing each other. Occasionally one, usually
Coulson, would come to the door and bawl a
remark. He had done so to-night, Hjalmar re-
membered, and Hjalmar had not caught the gist
of the words. He, in his turn, had called
back ; but Goulson had gone, so Hjalmar had
to follow him. And he had done this only to
discover that the engineer had casually informed
him that it was “ a grand night outside.” The
little "trouble for nothing” had unconsciously
irritated him, he decided, and in some occult way
started the mischief.
One of the Norwegian’s duties was to pump
water for the boiler. He could not tell why he
should suddenly calculate how long it would take,
supposing he let the boiler run dry, for the
whole show to burst and fly sky-high. He
swore viciously at himself in an attempt to divert
his thoughts. He counted up to absurd numbers.
He sang old half-forgotten sea chanties (he had
been a sailor), and again worked in a dogged silence,
with locked teeth and every muscle in his body
straining against himself. He got along that way
all right for a couple of hours, though Coulson was
surprised enough to have “ Paddy Doyle” roared
at him in response to a friendly greeting.
Once he had serious thoughts of going to the
engineer and telling him of the horror in his
mind, but he fought that off too, and prayed to
the God in whom he didn’t believe to make the
night pass quickly.
It must have been half an hour after midnight
when he awoke to the fact that the water in iiis
gauge glass was surely, if slowly, lowering. Also,
that he was viewing it with remarkable com-
placency. It was when he had pumped it up to
normal level again that he felt inclined to tell
Coulson, and it was unfortunate for both that he
did not. Thereafter he kept a tight rein on his
thoughts as far as it lay in his power, and per-
formed his work mechanically, and well enough
for a while.
At two o’clock Coulson, being in a companion-
able mood, came to share some supper dainty with
him. A few words of his spoken just as he was
departing impressed themselves on Hjalmar’s
memory.
“ These blessed electric lights are playin’Hell
with my eyes, so I’ve got a new plan to pass the
time. Remember that old alarum clock on the
shelf? Yes; well, I’m setting it at ten-minute
intervals, so’s I can dose a bit. ’Tisn’t half-bad
either, an’ I stick it close up to my ear so I can’t
possibly help hearing it.”
Perhaps he was asleep now ! Hjalmar walked
to the doorway, and, after a step or two into the
other room, he saw Coulson at a table in a remote
corner, out of the draught of the big, loose-fitting
egress door. Plis head was on the table, and near
it was a battered-looking clock. The alarum went
off suddenly with a husky whir, and the fireman,
deaf as he was to the ceaseless noise of the
machinery, started. He noticed, however, that
the sleepfer did not seem to rouse very quickly,
and he shook his head.
“You’ll get deaf to that in time,” he muttered,
“an’ you’ll oversleep yourself. An’ then we’ll
see.”
The idea occupied his mind for some time, until
at last it merged itself into those other ideas he
was trying so hard to avoid. Presently he gave up
the fight arid ceased to try. He went to the door
again to see the performance with the alarum
clock repeated. He should by now have been
pumping water for the boiler, but the pressure
had not perceptibly increased when Coulson
awoke.
The Norwegian held him in conversation for
three or four minutes after he had gone round
with his oil-can. Then, as he expected, the clock
was wound again, and Coulson turned his back to
the engine.
"Can’t sleep facing her,” he said. “Seems
like that gauge-glass nresmerises me.”
So Hjalmar saw his eyes close without another
100k —and he had gained close on five minutes.
There were ten minutes left in which he could
repair what he had done. He went back to his
room and looked at the narrow slit in the sheath
of his gauge-glass. Irresolutely he walked to
the pump. As irresolutely he came back to the
gauge glass. It was not till the water was near
the bottom, perilously near, that thought for his
own safety came.
How much time he had wasted he could not
guess. As he.turned to go, it struck him for the
first time that Coulson might have more than a
passive part to play after all. If he woke now,
the grip of his fingers on the safety-valve would
nullify Hjalmar’s work. He was puzzling over
this in angry discontent as he crept through the
engine-room, when he knocked himself against a
projection. The resultant curse that was startled
out of him brought Coulson to his feet quicker
than the alarum would have done.
Instinctively the engineer’s first thought was
his pressure-gauge, and a second after the Nor-
wegian heard his name called sharply. He heard
it again as Coulson, light-blinded after his sleep,
tore headlong upon him.
“Out o’ the way ! I must shut her down. Out
o’ the way, you fool.”
Hjalmar stood his ground blocking the narrow
path to safety. “No,” he said, simply and
quietly. Coulson blinked at him, uncomprehend-
ing for a moment. Then he shook him with
fingers that bit desperately into his muscles.
“You’re mad,” he cried, “stark,, staring”
The utter absurdity of the phrase as applied to
this quiet, steady-eyed man facing him prevented
its completion. He tried to force Hjalmar down.
“No,” said the Norwegian again, doggedly,
and his voice sounded true and level across the
roar of the racing machinery. And Coulson’s
breath caught like a fish-hook in his throat as the
roar increased in volume.
In the fight that followed Hjalmar was never
the aggressor. He didn’t want to hurt Coulson—
not that way—but he meant the boiler to burst.
Things were fairly equal between the two. The
stocky breadth of the Norwegian counterbalanced
the limber height of his antagonist. And the
strength of youth fresh-set to vigorous manhood
was in them both.
At first an odd jumble of thoughts crowded the
engineer’s brain. Predominant was the memory
of a scene in a rattling American novel in which
a fight between two men was terminated by the
use of the tricky “hammer-lock,” and he was
furious with himself that he did not know it.
He tried to rush the fireman, but steel met steel,
and he felt the floor rock under their feet as the
over-charged Corliss engine tore at the bolts that
pinned it down. Very soon now he knew that
certain inanimate objects would exercise referee’s
right, and stop this silent contest —men do not
waste good reserve power in yells that there is no
one to hear —in their own fashion. Meanwhile
the lust for first kill had gripped him.
He knew that it was foolish—a mere animal
instinct; but where is the full-blooded young
animal who will not abide by that instinct? He
was taking a wild joy in the struggle now, and
the Norwegian himself seemed roused to some-
thing like anger. But, after all, the neutral
referee drew first blood.
For it was a flying lubricator that knocked
Coulson’s soul into infinity just two seconds before
Hjalmar’s scurried after it in an unseemly haste
to find out the reason for many things.
