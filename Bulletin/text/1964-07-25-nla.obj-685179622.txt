LETTERS
TO THE
EDITOR
THE PILL
Sir,
The “Roman Catholic Priest” who
wrote “A Catholic Case for the Pill”
(11/7/64) keeps the anonymity that he
and other Catholic clerical pill-sup-
porters in Australia always cling to.
Why does he not tell us his name? The
overseas men have done so. The now
well known Fr Janssens, whom he
quotes, or rather misquotes, did so. He
is a Melbourne priest, we are told: he
need not be afraid, then, of stepping
over “some of the details of the local
(NSW) ecclesiastical party-line”, to use
his cheaply discourteous phrase.
But if he does not want to put his
name to his opinion and does want to
set forth his case from the dark, let him
accept the limitations that should go
with this. Personal attacks on those who
at any rate had the courage to come out
into the open are not admirable. Your
writer shows up as someone a little less
than a man.
One could agree with Fr Hogan’s
opinion given on the “Four Corners”
show and agree with his way of handling
discussion, or disagree with his opinion
but agree with his method, or disagree
with both; but no one other than a super-
ficial talker or a hothead would be any-
thing but cautious and exact in discuss-
ing such a subtle and profound question
within the narrow time-limits of a TV
session and under its conditions, most
trying for a guest speaker unused to
appearing on TV and knowing that any
loose word would be picked up all over
the country and almost certainly given
publicity if it seemed sensational.
A priest speaking purely privately, as
Fr Hogan was, knows that he will almost
certainly be taken by the unthinking to
be at least “semi-official”, as indeed
your writer called him. Small wonder
that he was wary, knowing how easily
so many would misinterpret him. Why
does your correspondent not come forth
and try it, on TV or on paper?
It is a pity that he wrote so unpleas-
antly, for much that he says in the
article proper is worthy of attention. I
myself cannot see that the matter is a
closed one yet. The arguments against
the pill do not yet clearly convince me.
But in a matter that has arisen so

THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME
Mr. Ernest Hiller is a craftsman.
He makes suits with more than
ordinary care.
He takes a craftsman’s pride in a
job well done. That’s why you’ll
find his own personal signature on
every suit he makes. It isn’t just
a brand name.
It’s Ernest Hiller’s personal guar-
antee to you.
It means your suit has been
tailored from the very finest fab-
rics. With the care and patience
Mr. Hiller demands.
It means you can buy the

recently (within the last 12 months, in
its present form), it is not surprising that
there should be obscurity; it is not sur-
prising that sound scholarship should
want to move slowly; and not surprising
that those who hold the “traditional”
view should resist what look very like
attempts to bustle them and press them
into hasty conformity with the new
thinkers. Finally, the Pope has asked
us, since that “Four Corners” show, not
to go on with the public airing of views
for the time; but that has not stopped
your correspondent.
PETER KELLY, SJ
Canisius College,
Pyntble (NSW).
Sir,
Your Melbourne contributor says: “In
his statement in 1958 Pope Pius XII did
not say of the use of anovulants, ‘this is
direct sterilisation’, but ‘there is question
here of direct sterilisation’. In other
words, he left, in the technical subtlety
of Vatican pronouncements, some room
for discussion.”
Unfortunately for your contributor’s
own subtlety, Pope Pius XII, speaking
in French, said that when the pill is used
with contraceptive intent “il s’agit done
de sterilisation directe”. (“Acta Aposto-
licae Sedis,” 1958, p. 735.) In other
words, he said: “Then it is a case of
direct sterilisation.” Prior to that he
had said clearly that, unless the pill were
being used to remedy a diseased condi-
tion, “a direct and, therefore, unlawful
sterilisation is induced when ovulation is
arrested”.
Addressing a group of cardinals on
June 23 last (as reported in our daily
Press, June 24, and later more fully in
Catholic papers throughout Australia)
our present Pope Paul VI gave the fol-
lowing ruling: “We say frankly that as
of now we do not have sufficient reason
to regard the norms given by Pope Pius
XII on this matter as outdated and,
therefore, not binding. They must, there-
fore, be considered valid ... a single
law the Church authoritatively proposes.”
And he insisted that “nobody for the
time being take it upon himself to speak
in terms different from the norms in
force”.
It is not true, then, that the “Roman
Catholic Church has as yet no official
attitude to the use of The Pill”. Pope
Paul Vi’s authoritative pronouncement
is one to which every truly Catholic
conscience will feel obliged to conform.

“MILITARY CASTE”
Sir,
I refer to your article in National
Notebook (4/7/64) titled “Military
Caste”. Whilst the recruiting advertise-
ment is perhaps a little overdramatic, in
fairness, I feel obliged to remind you
that while neither the Army, nor the
advertisement, claims that the Royal
Military College produces all, or even a
large number, of Australia’s leaders, it
does produce some. Undoubtedly y OUr
readers will assume the unquestionable
contribution to the defence of this
country in both peace and war by Dun-
troon graduates but may not be aware
of the contribution made in civil life,
A large number of graduates have
entered universities, taking degrees in
medicine, law, dentistry, veterinary
science, engineering, economics, science
arts or theology. Duntroon has produc-
ed King’s Counsel, a Judge of the NSW
Supreme Court, an Ambassador, a High
Commissioner and a Cabinet Minister in
the NSW Parliament. A graduate is the
Director-General of the Australian
Security Services, another was Chief
Executive Officer for the 1956 Olympic
Games, another is Commercial Coun-
sellor and Trade Commissioner in New
Zealand, and another holds the Chair of
History at the University of NSW. One
graduate is now Minister for the Army
and another is acting as Administrator
of the Commonwealth in the absence of
the Governor-General.
Quite apart from these specific cases,
there is a respectable number of gradu-
ates serving quietly, but in responsible
positions, in civil life, in the professions
and in commerce. By January, 1964,
rather less than 1400 Australians had
graduated from the Royal Military Col-
lege in its entire history. Bearing in
mind that the overwhelming majority of
graduates are professional soldiers, whose
duty is to officer the Australian Regular
Army, and that of them there have been
over 200 casualties in the Sovereign’s
service, the record of those few remain-
ing, who have returned to civil life, is,
I think you will agree, a reasonable one.

THE JEWS IN AUSTRALIA
Sir,
The two excellent articles entitled
“The Jews in Australia” by Sam Lipski
(20/6/64 and 27/6/64) were most
interesting and enlightening, despite a
somewhat unkind and debunking type
of critical letter from Alan D. Crown
in the issue of 4/7/64. We all have
friends in the Jewish community.
One interesting sidelight in the second
article was the statement that “Jews tend
to vote for the left of centre parties in
contradiction of their economic position
as middle class or higher”. This is news
to most of us. Another interesting side-
light in the second article was Mr Lip-
ski’s mention that the Australian Govern-
ment “protested against Soviet discrimi-
nation in the United Nations”, and his
reference to “Senator Cohen’s opposition
to the move for a United Nations’
protest”.
Apparently, judging from his article,
the Jewish community or a section of it
is split on whether or not to condemn
Russia for its discrimination and per-
secution of the Jews there, which

was exposed in earlier issues of The
Bulletin and by two leading American
weekly magazines.
This divergence and lack of unity in
the Jewish community (or a section of
it) in condemning Russian persecution
is difficult to understand in view of the
universal condemnation of Hitler for
persecution and extermination of Jews
in Germany during the last war. It is
rather significant that Russia, which was
on terms of friendship with Germany
during the first 21 months of the war,
never (so far as one has ever read or
heard) protested against Hitler’s shock-
ing treatment of the Jews, nor has this
failure been condemned.

STUDENTS’ ALP CLUB
Sir,
Mr Jim Jupp’s letter on your report
of the ASLF conference (4/7/64) is
quite inaccurate, but since he found it
necessary to write it may I be allowed
to comment? In 1963 Mr Jupp and his
associates launched a strong personal
attack against me, pursued mainly
through the student Press and by othei
means, the object of which was —as they
openly admitted —to “destroy” me and
my political influence on students. The
attack, details of which are very well
known locally, backfired rather badly
since it alienated the more stable and
morally conservative members of the
Melbourne University ALP Club from
Mr Jupp and his friends.
At this year’s ALP Club election a
new club executive was elected by a
considerable majority which is strongly
anti-Communist, anti-Victorian Central
Executive, and independent of Mr Jupp
(and of myself, for that matter). Fol-
lowing the election Mr Jupp and his
supporters went out of their way to make
the club unworkable.
Mr Jupp claims now that it is inap-
propriate for staff-members to do any-
thing about student club executives by
direct involvement. Yet he certainly
did not practise what he now preaches.
He participated in faction meetings of
the defeated group, signed a document
to the University Union Council de-
manding the impounding of club pro-
perty and a new election, and generally
dispensed advice, abuse and reprimand.
Among the charges laid against the new
executive was the allegation that I have
paid students to join the club—and elect
that executive. All the charges have
been dismissed by the Union Council.
There is evidence that in 1963, before
the Federal Election, Mr Jupp encourag-
ed co-operation and “peaceful coexis-
tence” with the Victorian Central Execu-
tive of the ALP, particularly with the
executive secretaries, Messrs Wyndham
and Hartley. I was opposed to such
co-operation if it involved toning down
of legitimate criticism and discussion,
hence I had to “go”. Yet there is evi-
dence also that Mr Jupp has now re-
turned again to his “old” position.
Like myself, Mr Jupp has taken!
deep and active interest in student p o j|
tics, and, unlike myself, he involve!
himself much earlier and much nit® 1
thoroughly in organisational and soci;
participation. I like my own influent,
to be based predominantly on my lecture
and seminars. Mr Jupp’s new and ej
tirely bogus self-denying ordinance j,,

friends. Mr Kent-Hughes’ views on
defence and foreign policy, limited as
they are by his toryism, stand on
brightly against the mindless backgroum
of the Liberal Party. As for Santa
maria, ever since I have had the hono:
to know him I have come to regard hit
as the most outstanding public figure in!
Australia—a man of unyielding moral,
strength, superb political skill, and great
intellectual power. ,

PETER THOMSON
Sir,
As a postscript to your excellent article!
on Peter Thomson (4/7/64) may I
recall a pleasant and significant incident
in which I participated. A few days
before the Centenary British Open at.
St Andrews in July, 1960, a mutual
friend invited my wife and myself t(j
meet Peter and his wife in her Stl
Andrews home, where Peter met for th*:
first time two members of the Rulesi
Committee of the Royal and Ancient
Club of St Andrews. These charming
amateurs were of the select number of,
local residents who not only make the!
rules of golf for Scotland, but also for
England, Australia and virtually the{
whole world (except the USA, which;
follows the rules of the PGA).
It was a glorious opportunity for
to expound his ideas on golf, e.g., that:
golf today was being spoiled by thel
American influence which would sacri-l
fice the natural vicissitudes of the game l
to the fetish of low scoring. He sug-i
gested that the imminent Open would,
have been more sporting if the greens[
have not been heavily watered to facili-
tate accurate pitching with the correct
club instead of the more traditional
“pitch and run” technique which made
the Royal and Ancient in its day the most
difficult of courses. He protested against,
the concessions currently being made toj
American ideas because in general the
revised rules would benefit the top pr° s [
at the expense of the average amateur
John Stobbs is right in characterising
Thomson as an amateur at heart.
Peter’s idea of a second world circuit
is a development of the thesis he so abl)
propounded that day.

National Notebook
Cheap at the Price
OF course, there was the one inevitable
letter to “The Sydney Morning
Herald” complaining about the charge of
2s. admission for the Dobell Retrospec-
tive at the normally free Art Gallery of
HSW. But for most Sydney people 2s.
for 224 canvases of Australia’s best-
known and best-loved artist seemed
cheap at the price.
The gallery expects at least 100,000
people to see the exhibition during its-
four weeks on display, and will also
need to clear £lOOO a week to cover cost
of mounting the exhibition.
One souvenir of Dobell’s down-and-
out days in London is a small painting
called The Fortune Teller. It was
originally done as a tyre advertisement
and the name of the manufacturer has
now been painted out.
Perchance to Scream
VUe arrived at the Sydney party for
" Screaming Lord Sutch just as some-
one was saying they had heard he had
been charged excess air baggage for his
coffin and that he had
mislaid the golden hairnet
presented to him by Safety
Patrol for keeping his hair
out of the traffic. Most of
the people present were
silent though, and the
whole thing had rather
the air of a wake. Not surprisingly. His
Lordship himself turned out to be barely
animate: slouched in a corner, his hair
caught up under a sky-blue porkpie hat,
his scream reduced to a strangled growl,
he nodded off so often during the con-
versation we had practically to nudge him
to get him to go on.
He had, he said, come all the way from
Blackpool without a wink of sleep. But
there would be plenty of time for that
later, and his coffin was comfortable.
Coaxing him to remember the past was
difficult, but he finally recalled how he
got started. He had been trudging in
traditional fashion from cafe to cafe when
he finally got a break. In mid-number his
shoulder-length hair fell over his face
and suddenly the audience began scream-
ing.
“So I put on a top hat and tails. And
■ I’d run out of the back of the audience
| and up on the stage. Then I’d scream and
jump about. Well, it stopped the show.
Some people didn’t understand it, but
most did. Then I really took off at the
Two Eyes Coffee Bar in London. I moved
out to different ballrooms, theatres. I’d
dress up as Jack the Ripper with a knife
a nd all, and I’d get in a cage and shake
the bars like King Kong. Yes, I’d make
a monkey of myself.
“Then I decided to take up politics. I
stood for the Stratford seat against an
Australian. Yes, an Australian. His name
was Angus Maude. Have you heard of
him? You have? Well, I was representing
the National Teenage Party. Oh yes, we
were properly registered and everything.
There were only 80 members.
“Anyway, I didn’t get in. Even with
my van. I had it specially painted all
purple and yellow, with signs like ‘Vote
for Ghoul, He’s No Fool’.”
And what about the future? “I’d like
to appear in a horror film.” And brush-
ing back a lock of hair, Lord Sutch
asked someone for an aspirin.
After the Dancing Years
A funny thing happened to Freddie
Carpenter at the London Palladium
•—he directed Dame Edith Evans and
Sir John Gielgud in a romantic waltz.
The occasion was the “Night of a
100 Stars” when Britain’s top theatrical
people perform in aid of
the Actors’ Orphanage.
This snippet came our
way during a rehearsal
break at Sydney’s Theatre
Royal where “A Funny
Thing Happened On The
Way To The Forum”
was going through its final paces.
Australian-born, Carpenter, a bouncy,
energy-packed man with an ageless face
and a thatch of red hair, was brought
back from Britain to direct “The Forum”
after his success with “How To Succeed
In Business Without Really Trying”. He
was wearing a Beatle jacket and tight
slacks and complained bitterly about the
cold as he threw a camelhair coat about
his shoulders.
“I often wonder whether our local
people have the drive and enthusiasm to
succeed in theatre,” he said in accents
redolent of the West End. “Of course,
in my day many people made it. Take
Coral Browne. Few people think of
her as Australian. I rate her among
Britain’s leading actresses.
“I remember back in the old days
when heads would turn in Sydney streets
for a principal dancer. Today it’s the
telly that seems to have all the glamor.
I was trying to persuade a father to let
his daughter join a show recently. I had
to work hard on it. He thought her
future could only be in television.”
Carpenter is particularly happy that
The Firm is bringing out directors. He
feels a good director can do wonders and

that talent exists here aplenty. But he
believes drive and hard work are
essential.
“I began as a dancer and that’s how
I made my name. I went to New York
years ago and won a thousand-dollar
prize from John Murray Anderson,
director of the Ziegfeld Follies. That
put me on my feet in more ways than
one. Sophie Tucker took me to London
and then I received two offers in one
day. One was to do the choreography
for a C. B. Cochran show and the other
came from Ivor Novello to do ‘The
Dancing Years’. I chose Ivor and be-
came his assistant. He taught me so
much.
“Of course those were the days when
a dancer really starred. At one time I
had five shows in the West End. I re-
member seeing my name in lights above
the London Hippodrome. I moved into
films. I’ve always thought Agnes De
Mille ended the era of the individual
dancer changed things to the group
idea—but it was through her I directed
the dancing in ‘London Town’, the
biggest film musical ever made in
Britain. She was assigned the choreo-
graphy. Then she had to pull out, and
I took over.’^
After a wartime role with the RAF
Fighter Command, Carpenter decided
the post-war years offered him more as
a director. “John Murray Anderson told
me, ‘As he gets older a dancer’s value
decreases as a director’s increases’. So
I’ve stuck to direction ever since. When
they invited me out to do ‘How to
Succeed’ I was really happy. I hadn’t
been to Australia for years. It’s marvel-
lous what you can do.”
Stars in Their Courses
Astronomer Royal, Sir Richard
A Woolley, seemed to us perfectly cast
for the role: the hair suitably grizzled,
the face strong and flinty, the eyes
fixed and quizzical. Sir Richard has
been here for some weeks talking with
scientists and Government representatives
about the proposed new 150-inch tele-
scope which, he hopes, will complement
the celebrated radio-telescope at Parkes,
NSW. He feels that the new telescope
will put Australia still more firmly on
the scientific map, and says that it will
be the most powerful instrument ever to
probe the southern sky.
Sir Richard, who was for 16 years
director of Mt Stromlo, said that his
field was the Galaxy. However, he was
prepared to admit that, as galaxies go,
it was a fairly uninteresting one and that
we are in a rather uninteresting part of)
it. (
Sir Richard said that the site for the/
new telescope had not yet been settled
On a previous visit he had been to Mount!
Singleton in Western Australia. This
time he has looked at the Flinders Ranges,
and Siding Springs Mountain, near'
Coonabarabran, NSW. Had he made!
up his mind which location was best?)
“I'm placing bets.” On which site? “NoJ
that would be telling, wouldn’t it?”
What did he hope to see through thef
new telescope? “We shall be able to!
have a good look at the centre of the'
galaxy,” he said. “And at the Magella-
nic clouds. They are the galaxies closest
to our own. You can't see them from
Mount Palomar. We should be able to
study stars in great detail that are many)
times brighter than the sun. The cost,
of the telescope will be shared 50-50-’
between the UK and Australia. It will
be about £6,000,000.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Goldwater Win
GOLD WATER won in a walk,
literally. There was never any
question of his nomination as the
despatch on page 33 says. What is
important about his winning is
what this means to America’s chief
Opposition Party and alternative
Government. The Senator’s win
certainly means, among other
things, that the GOP has taken a
radically new direction and for the
worse. Senator Goldwater may be
either ruinously impulsive or short-
sightedly opportunistic as we said
once before, but either way he is
the focus of the most uncertain
and illiberal elements in the United
States with all that that implies for
the rest of the world. His win
canalises the discontents, resent-
ments and frustrations of a very
large section of the American
people including, as the article on
page 33 points out, a quite astonish-
ing number of young American
people. It also symbolises the end
of an era dominated by the eastern
kingmakers, the middle of the road
“me too” Republicans, the east
coast big city states, the moderate
Republican newspapers. It makes
nonsense of Scranton and Lodge
and, above all, Rockefeller. It
represents white fears of Negro
excesses. It celebrates the triumph
of a really superb organisation
which has worked steadily and in-
telligently from grass roots to Con-
vention over the past four years
and against which neither Scran-
ton’s ill-organised, last-ditch op-
position nor the expensive but mis-
calculated one of Rockefeller could
possibly prevail
Even if, as the great east coast
newspapers lament, Goldwater now
leads a minority party within a
party he has nevertheless collected
an impressive American vote of
protest a protest which ranges
from the iniquities of centralised
government to foreign policy. The
sheer charm of the Goldwater
position is that he does not have
to sit down and work out the pain-
staking results of a policy to obtain
the protest vote. That vote is
already there readily made for his
particular brand of skilful exploita-
tion. No one thinks that he can
beat President Johnson in Novem-
ber but it might be well to remem-
ber that there, have been bigger
upsets in American politics.
The Catholic Weekly
A LEADER in the Sydney
“Catholic Weekly” of July 16
is headed “A Matter of Loyalty”.
The leader says that a “Well-adver-
tised article entitled ‘A Catholic
Case for the Pill’ and published in a
nationally circulated magazine re-
cently gave the impression that the
use of anovulant pills as contra-
ceptives was a completely open
question.
“If the article had been written
by some staff correspondent there
would be no need for comment,
because Catholics should know by
this time that the least likely place
to find a reliable exposition of moral
theology would be in the columns
of secular journals.
“The author of the article in
question, however, purported to be
a ‘Roman Catholic priest’ and for
this reason the views he expressed
ma y be given more weight than
they deserve.”
Jn firs( p]ace it is most im _
proper of “The Catholic Weekly”
suggest that our
purported to be a priest. He is
a P nest -
But there is not much point in
being scratchy with the “Catholic
Weekly” over this issue because as
far as we are concerned it is a fairly
simple matter. The article was
offered to us and we published it
because it was of sufficient interest.
It seemed also something of an old-
fashioned “scoop” because, as far
as we knew, it contained material
that had not been published widely
in Australia and certainly not in
the NSW Catholic Press.
HTHESE are sound journalistic
reasons and we do not claim
that it is part of our responsibility
to inform Catholics in areas where
their own Press apparently does
not. However, we cannot see that
Pope Paul’s statement of June 24
was intended to make oral contra-
ceptives a completely closed ques-
tion until a final statement comes
from the Pope. The “Catholic
Weekly” and two correspondents
whose letters we publish this week
apparently do. The Pope did say
that it “therefore seems opportune
to recommend (recommend be-
comes insist in Dr Rumble’s letter)
that nobody for the time being take
it upon himself to speak in terms
different from the norms in force.”
The Pope also said then that
“population growth, on the one
hand, and family morality on the
other” was an “extremely serious
problem”. “It touches the source
of human life,” the Pope added.
“It touches sentiments and con-
cerns which are closest to the ex-
perience of man and woman.” Not,
one might note, sentiments and
concerns which are closest to the
experiences of bishops and priests.
The Pope’s final statement on
the question will have effects be-
yond the walls of the Church. One
of the most valuable adjuncts of the
Church’s study on the subject is a
well - informed laity, which will
accept the Pope’s ruling in intelli-
gent and generous loyalty. Only in
the minds of the most authoritarian
does loyalty mean acceptance in
ignorance.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE COMMONWEALTH
Problems of a Final
Communique
Not bad for a compromise
TUNKU ABDUL RAHMAN
“Sympathy and support”
FROM ALAN REID IN LONDON
British Prime Minister, Sir Alec
A Douglas-Home, is acknowledged to
have done a good job at the Common-
wealth Prime Ministers’ Conference.
Even the Africans, the turbulent element
at the Conference, concede that Home
was apparently the epitome of tact,
courtesy, patience, agility and considera-
tion. But chairmanship, however gifted
and impressive, cannot bridge basic divi-
sions and, as I see it, the divisions at the
Conference were quite fundamental and
clearly perceptible through the wordiness
of the final communique.
The Conference really divided into two
groups. There were those who held that
the Commonwealth's problems could not
be solved except in a world context. In
this group were Canada, New Zealand,
Australia and—on the occasions when
South-East Asia came up for discussion
Malaysia and India. Then there
were those, mainly the Africans, who
held that Commonwealth issues could be
decided in isolation and that any attempt
to fit them into a world or cold war con-
text must be resisted.
This outlook was, in part, though not
completely, the outcome of the Africans’
understandably whole-hearted preoccu-
pation with the problems of Africans
newly freed from the old imperialism
and, as yet, not too obviously suffering
inroads at the hands of the new Com-
munist imperialism. Britain was in a
special category by itself as the former
repository of imperial power over all the
countries represented at the conference
table, trying to perform the difficult feat
of being all things to all men.
The “world context” school of thought
did not do very well out of the final
communique. This is not surprising when
you understand how the communique
is drafted. Each individual delegation
leader—and there were 18 delegations,
with the Africans leading in numbers
—has the right of veto. If he objects to
any section of the communique, out it
comes.
Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Aus-
tralia, Malaysia and (as regards Red
China) India, would all have liked a
forthright condemnation of the new im-
perialism as well as of the old racial-
based imperialism. But Pakistan has
friendly relationships with Red China and
is not too well disposed towards India,
partly because of the Kashmir issue.
President Nkrumah of Ghana, who
follows a similar cult of personal leader-
ship, is reputed to have an amiable
association with President Soekarno.
There are a whole network of interlock-
ing associations extending beyond the
Commonwealth but shaping the Com-
monwealth discussions, despite the
Africans’ insistence that Commonwealth
issues should be dealt with in isolation.
This inhibited those who are against
the new imperialism. They knew that
if they went too far they would get
nothing. They wanted something, par-
ticularly in support of Malaysia, whose
position as a nation of 10,000,000 faced
with “confrontation” of indefinite dura-
tion by a nation of 90,000,000 must be
regarded as most unhappy. As it
happened the best they could get into
the communique was an anaemic ex-
pression of “sympathy and support”, not
for the Malaysian nation, but for its
Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman,
in his struggle.
When the Conference agreed to put
into the communique a plea for release
of all African political leaders detained
in Southern Rhodesia the Africans got
as blunt a condemnation of the Southern
Rhodesian Government as they could
have hoped for.
But despite this agreement—and it
did not go as far as the Africans, who
suggested military pressure on Southern
Rhodesia, said they wanted, though
it is probably more than they expected
to get—the fundamental division remains.
It is a division between those who are
opposed to colonial rule in all its mani-
festations, whether old style or modernly
streamlined by Communism or National-
ists like President Soekarno, and those
who are still exclusively preoccupied
with the fragments of old-style imperial-
ism still existing. It is not without signifi-
cance that the Tunku, victim of the new-
style imperialism, goes on to Washington
and Canada after the Conference, while
some of the Africans are off to Cairo,
where both the Communist and Nation-
alist modern form of imperialism plan
to rub shoulders now well-padded with
Communist arms.
DRINKING - I
The Latest Party Game
At the drop of a baton ...
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
young legal bucks, and
others who found innocent merri-
ment in the National Hotel liquor inquiry
a few months ago, are now feeling its
side-effects. The Licensing Squad, a trifle
bloodied but quite unbowed by the in-
quiry, and now burning with Liquor Act
zeal, is imposing the letter of the 1941
“dance hall” amendment. This law bans
the hard stuff from all but purely private
dances and (after 10 p.m.) hotel dance
floors. It was passed 23 years ago, when
the old “frontier” Brisbane was invaded
by hordes of friendly nay, amorous
troops. It remains law, partly through
inertia, partly through the efforts of the
wowser set which was lively when
Queensland was about the only 10 o’clock
closing State, and which still has weight
with a majority of the Nicklin cabinet.
The Army usually out-manoeuvres the
State groghounds by declaring its chosen
ballroom federal territory for the evening.
But Brisbane lawyers cannot match the
constitutional subtlety of the military. In
the past fortnight two fashionable legal
dinner-dances have received (not un-
expected) chaperones from the CIB.


0f course, the “dance hall” clause, like
wassail rules of old Denmark, has al-
ways been more honored in the breach
than in the observance. Queensland’s ball-
room tables, you see, have legs as modest-
ly draped as those in Victorian drawing
rooms, and more happens beneath them
than holding hands.
But now, with the Licensing Squad
lads among the wallflowers, our life, love
law and liquor grow more Gilbertian.
Recently the Qld University law students
(and distinguished guests) kept revel at a
fashionable Brisbane reception lounge.
Many came braced by recent perusal of
the Liquor Act. And the Squad came, as
the grapevine had foretold.
But pleasure stayed. Overawed perhaps,
by the presence of prosperous attorneys
and the rustle of both legal and feminine
silk, the gendarmes gave the old Act a
new and liberal interpretation. In the one
hall, it transpired, there could be dancing
then drinking, then dancing, etc., pro-
vided each delight occupied strictly
separate time-slots.
So every time the bandleader’s baton
rose, every keg and bottle was stoppered,
and at the first twinkle of Cinderella’s
slipper, all glasses were whisked away.
Whenever thirst-pangs struck leading
guests the band was swiftly silenced. And
so the old ’4l Amendment turned up as
the very latest party game.
Apparently Police Commissioner Bis-
chof reckons that police and public can
just about stand it until amendments,
expected within a few months, lift the
war emergency from the State’s dance
floors. His “regulation strike” may even
hasten them.
DRINKING - II
Always on a
Sunday
A plate of biscuits ...
FROM A HOBART CORRESPONDENT
Tasmania’s cumbersome Sunday drink-
* ing laws are breaking down. They
were made by a Government fearful of
the wowser element yet eager to oblige
hotelkeepers—and ready enough to meet
the demands of tourists and sophisti-
cated Tasmanians provided its tolerance
did not lead it into collision with the
trade or the trade’s enemies.
Tasmania was an Australian leader
in legislating for drinking sanity on week-
days, but the Government has been in
bother from the beginning in attempts to
find a formula for Sunday drinking.
Originally it perpetuated a bona fide
traveller clause geared to the horse and
dray. On Sundays the pubs ringing
larger towns were crowded with travel-
lers (i.e., persons who had travelled a
few miles for a lawful drink). The sys-
tem was claimed to be the cause of
many Sunday road accidents.
The Government finally agreed to
open hotels on Sundays for two hours
in the middle of the day and two hours
in the evening to supply drink to those
having meals in the dining rooms. “Din-
ing rooms” was the operative phrase:
lounges were to be used only after all
the tables had been taken.
Some hotels quickly found an answer.
They cheerfully proffered to acquiescent
guests a plate of biscuits, which were
used and re-used as accompaniment to
the beer until worn out by handling.
Interpreting the spirit of the law, the
Licensing Court acted firmly. As Mr
C. W. Brown, one of its members, re-
marked, it appreciated the problems, but
it could only apply the law. It laid down
what it termed a “minimum menu”, con-
sisting of soup, fish or entree; hot meat
or poultry with two vegetables, or cold
collation; choice of three sweets; tea or
coffee.
Not surprisingly, only 178 of Tas-
mania’s 282 hotels applied for a meal
permit last year. Fifteen applications
were refused. Those with a permit may,
of course, serve meals on Sundays, and
many do, but they may not lawfully
serve liquor to the diners. And people
who want a drink must not only order
a meal and pay for it, but must presum-
ably go through the motions of eating it.
The situation seems pretty silly to most
Tasmanians, not excluding the anti-
liquor people. Demand is growing for
a new look at Sunday drinking, even
to the extent of frankly opening bars.
Tourist-conscious Tasmanians believe the
reform is necessary to make visitors
happy, and hotels are all for it.
From the hotels’ viewpoint, however,
there is a catch. A considerable relaxa-
tion of licensing law, ostensibly for the
comfort and enjoyment of tourists, will
add weight to the argument that good
restaurants should also be licensed. To
this suggestion, as to demands for the
licensing of grocers’ shops, the Australian
Hotels’ Association is irrevocably op-
posed.

Why Did Salton
Resign?
A matter of funds
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
PROF. BAXTER
No new experience
One evening a week ago a world-
famous scientist drained a four-foot
long laboratory research tube of beer at
Kingsford Smith Airport as a gesture of
protest against the “administration” of
the University of New South Wales. He
was Professor M. R. Salton, B.Sc.Agr.
(Syd.), Ph.D. (Cantab.), Professor of
Microbiology at that University from
February, 1962, until a few days ago.
The “administration” against whom
Dr Salton’s curiously theatrical gesture
was aimed is embodied in an equally
distinguished scientist, Professor J. P.
Baxter, C.M.G., 0.8. E., B.Sc., Ph.D.,
F.A.A., F.R.A.C.1., M.l.E.(Aust-),
A.M.I.Che.E., the Vice-Chancellor of
the University and Chairman of the Aus-
tralian Atomic Energy Commission, who
seems destined periodically to bring the
wrath of outraged academics down upon
his distinguished head.
Dr Salton’s main complaint was his
lack of control of funds, a matter which
has apparently concerned him since
shortly after he took up appointment.
However, he failed to reveal a number
of facts which are surely relevant —that
he was given £lO,OOO without strings to
develop his equipment; that he moved
into a new building which, because it
did not suit him, was extensively altered
at a cost of several thousands; and that
he was given discretion to select and
bring out staff with him from the United
Kingdom. Is this sort of administration
really inhibiting upon academics and
their true purposes?
The latest furore was not a novel
experience for the Vice-Chancellor.
Those who had crossed swords with him
in the past —by all accounts with little
success immediately sprang to arms
again, raising old issues and claiming

the imminent, if not immediate, degene-
ration of the institution. Interestingly,
however, Professor Baxter has acquired
some supporters who were equally quick
to decry the “personal vendetta” being
carried out against him.
What exactly is this continually-recur-
ring controversy about? Is Baxter an
unreasonable autocrat or only a strong
administrator? The answer depends a
great deal upon one’s own ideas about
the way universities should be run.
Much of the criticism is so highly
colored or vague that it is practically
meaningless. Associate Professor
Skertchly, one-time member of the
School of Textile Technology, has said
he “wouldn’t touch the university with
a barge-pole”. Professor A. E. Alexander,
once Professor of Applied Chemistry
and Dean of the Faculty of Science at
New South Wales, accuses the Vice-
Chancellor, in a broadside, of driving
away many of his best staff and bringing
his University and Australia into dis-
repute. Other comments, however, have
been more specific. It has been suggested
that the administration is contrary to
“accepted university practice”; that it is
“most inefficient and wasteful, because
of its Public Service procedures”; that
staff “do not have sufficient freedom in
running their departments to give the
institution the right to be called a uni-
versity in the traditional sense of a self-
governing community of scholars”; and
that “departments do not have autonomy
to decide their own day-to-day purchases
within their budget.”
The last of these criticisms is the only
one that is really down to earth and it is
untrue. So-called “departments” (schools
at NSW), in fact, have a substantial
portion of their budget within their
direct control. Items of major plant
(costing over £100) must be approved
by the Vice-Chancellor’s Advisory Com-
mittee (12 out of 14 are academics), but
smaller ' items can be purchased as
quickly as they can be supp'ied and the
total amount available in this way, if
needed, is quite often as much as half
of a school’s budget. Proposals for pur-
chase of major plant are included in
annual estimates and are approved, or
deferred, according to the Vice-Chan-
cellor’s Advisory Committee’s judgment
of the relative needs of the forty-odd
schools within the University. There is
no other way to disburse funds.
ROADS
Mental Health and
Motorists
£100,000 for research
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
CLIVE STONEHAM
500 killed so far
Tt was Mental Health Week down here
last week. The outspoken chairman
of the Mental Health Authority, Dr E.
Cunningham Dax, set the ball rolling by
suggesting that insurance companies put
up £lOO,OOO to start research work into
the “mental make-up” of motorists. He
claimed this would help to reveal more
about the causes of road accidents and
would eventually prove more successful,
as regards profit, than merely increasing
vehicle premiums.
“There is a lot of talk, in road acci-
dents, about the state of cars and roads,
but more should be learnt about the
motorist, his personality and the frame
of mind under which he drives,” Dr Dax
said. He added that the same sort of
research was needed in industry where
costly industrial strife often sprang from
workers’ “mental frustrations.”
Mr Clive Stoneham, the newly-re-
turned leader of the State Opposition,
during the supply debate in the Legisla-
tive Assembly urged the Bolte Liberal
Government to interest itself in Dr Dax’s
proposal. He pointed out that more than
500 people had been killed on Victorian
roads this year and, if this rate was
maintained, then the toll would be
around 900 by December 31. Last
year the figure was 794.
All in all, the Melburnians agreed
with the general idea. But the insu-
rance companies didn’t. The chairman
of the Fire and Accident Underwriters’
Association of Victoria, Mr E. I. Pynor,
said road accidents were only one of
the thousands of risks which insurance
companies covered. He added that “if
the companies were to undertake re-
search into risk reduction in all these
fields, the costs would be astronomical
and this would only result in higher
premiums.” This, of course, is true too.
But the point is that research is not
needed in other fields to the same extent
as it is in road accidents. In many fields
it is not needed at all. Mr Pynor went
on to point out that road toll reduction
was a job for the whole community, not
just sections of it.
Would an annual contribution of
£lOO,OOO really hurt the insurance com-
panies? In the first place it could pos-
sibly be made tax-deductible or reduce
taxes in some other way, and it could
have a long-run effect on profits. Pro-
bably five of the biggest companies
operating in Melbourne in this field
would be Commercial Union, Mercantile
Mutual, New Zealand Insurance, Queens-
land Insurance and South British. To-
gether, their profit totalled a little more
than £4 million in the 1962-63 financial
year. £lOO,OOO equals 2J per cent of
this. Surely these firms, which have
solid and healthy earning rates anyway,
would gamble 2i per cent of their profits
on long-run gains?

THE OLYMPICS
Dead Wood
for Tokyo
Making ourselves ridiculous?
FROM “DISCUS” IN SYDNEY
T ast week a correspondent raised the
ghost of Baron de Coubertin, chair-
man of the lOC to 1925, quoting the
baron’s “To compete, not to win”
dictum as the guiding principle for Aus-
tralia’s Olympic squad, which has grown
and grown to 220 competitors and more
than 50 officials and coaches.
But “to compete” was only a fraction
of the old gentleman’s old - world
Olympic ideal, which also included the
notion that the Games should be free
of religious, political and racial implica-
tions. In 1964 this has never been less
true. South Africa, Indonesia and Red
China are out for just such reasons.
And how true is the Olympic definition,
“one who participates in sport solely for
pleasure . . . without material gain”?
The Australian Olympic Federation,
faced with total nominations of 297
competitors, officials and coaches, and
a bill of at least £160,000 for their
transport to and from Tokyo, must cut
back. At present it is looking hard at
the number of officials nominated. Its
searching gaze should go further.
Of the 220 competitors, more than
150 will have no chance at all, will
know they have no chance at all, and
will be participating for pleasure the
pleasure of a free trip to Tokyo, price
about £BO,OOO. It seems a high price
for the glory of having perhaps the
fourth largest cheering squad among
some 180 countries, most of whom will
send between one and 10 competitors.
As Roy Emerson had to remind the
LTAA, our stranger actions in sport
are not purely domestic, they are noticed
by the rest of the world. Australia will
not be lauded by the baron’s shade for
sending the largest squad of no-hopers in
history to the Olympic Games. We are
much more likely to be considered very
peculiar, wasteful, over-confident people
by the other nations, including some
whose respect Australia might prefer.
The remedy exists. The AOF should
give the member associations a directive
to prune back to the good wood. It
should not off-load managers and coaches
of value to accommodate competitors
and “officials” of no value.
Does that seem a ridiculous suggestion,
more foolish than the notion that the
important thing is to compete, to the
point of ridicule?


OIL
Battling Against
the “Big Boys”
The enterprising Mr Cocks
FROM D. MCDOUGALL IN MELBOURNE
R. W. MILLER
Not the only battler
Mr R. W. Miller is not the only man
connected with the oil fight or rising
costs.
In Melbourne last week, the faintest
glimmer of hope for a reduction in
oil prices rose meekly over the hori-
zon, thanks to the ingenuity of one
Mr Basil W. Cocks. He is the sole owner
of a small, independent company, Day-
lube Oil, which has started importing
refined petrol from a plant in Southern
Japan. It’s selling at 6id. a gallon
cheaper than the normal price—if you
buy it in a 44-gallon drum equipped with
a small hand pump, on nominal deposit.
The price works out at 3s. lid. for super
and 2s. lOid. for standard, compared
with the normal 3s. Bd. and 3s. sd. It is
called “Daygas” and sales to date have
been “most encouraging”.
If the thought of your own drum and
pump does not appeal, then an indepen-
dent service station in Middle Park will
fill your tank at 3d a gallon cheaper
than normal prices. This is the only
reselling outlet which Mr Cocks has
signed up so far, but he has his eyes
on the rest of Victoria’s independent
owners (who comprise about 10 p.c. of
the total) and plans for NSW if local
operations prove successful.
So far, he has imported two shipments
to an independent bulk terminal on
Coode Island, near the mouth of the
Maribyrnong River. He says it is “at
least equal to petrol already on sale
in Australia”. Needless to say we can’t
reveal how much has come in, but the
same tanker made the deliveries and
it was a 14,000 tonner. Mr Cocks is
anxious, and justifiably so, to keep as
much information as possible out of
the hands of the “big boys”.
Just how good are his chances of
success? His own personal determina-
tion will go a long way in gaining it.
He set the firm up in 1939, supplying
“Daylube” oil in sealed bottles to garages.
He later moved to batteries and is now
also selling “Ohtsu” Japanese tyres* at a
higher discount to resellers than any
other tyre company. In 1952, the busi-
ness took a knock when the 250 garages
who used his oil had to cease handling
the product because of the agreements
which were being signed up with the
“big boys” who bought out most stations.
Of course, his main problem will be
the attitude which the “big boys” take
to him. As long as he remains small
(his aim is only for one p.c. of the Vic-
torian market at present) they will pro-
bably let him be. Nevertheless, they will
undoubtedly put the “hard word” on the
independents as their contracts draw
close to expiry and the incentive for
buying out these people will be sub-
stantially increased.
SECULARISM
ffiJiulLetCn
80 Years Ago: July 26, 1884
jyiß Trickett fairly cornered the
Secularists when, in reply to their
claims to be permitted to send repre-
sentatives to impart religious teaching
to children in the Public Schools, he
showed that, in effect, all they pro-
posed to teach was already provided
for by the Act as part of the ordinary
course of teaching. The retort of the
Secularists will probably be that, al-
though the Act makes provision, as
the Minister alleges, that “it shall be
the duty of all teachers to impress on
the minds of their pupils the prin-
ciples of morality, truth, justice, and
patriotism; to teach them to avoid
idleness, profanity, and falsehood; to
instruct them in the principles of free
government; and to train them up to
a true comprehension of the rights,
duties, and dignity of citizenship,”
nothing definite is, in reality, done
in this direction. And this retort will
be absolutely true.
WOOL
The Report
Growers are split
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Oir William Gunn last week presented
the Wool Board’s keenly-awaited
report on marketing to the Australian
Wool Industry Conference just before
public announcement of a remarkably
high cheque for the 1963-64 season
at £447.3 million the third-highest ever,
and principally a result of an 18 per cent
rise in average prices compared with the
previous season.
He was received with deep attention
and ended to the tune of dignified ap-
plause. It is doubtful whether such a
polite atmosphere can last. After Con-
ference examination the report and its
reserve price recommendations must be
taken direct to the growers, who are
split on the rival claims of marketing
and promotion.
The industry has rejected a reserve plan
twice before, first by referendum in 1951
and again by the Philp committee in
1961. Lately, however, demands for
measures to attain more stability have
been more vocal, while the drift of prices
at the start of the new season will lend
the pro-reservists additional support.
The Wool Board committee was em-
powered last year to investigate alter-
natives to the historic auction system
of selling the vast majority of Australia’s
clip. Its choices were obviously: a reserve
(floor) price in the auction method; an
appraisement scheme; or an acquisition
scheme which could subsequently either
auction, negotiate or quote selling.
Board approval has now been given
firmly to a reserve within an auction sys-
tem, plainly an attempt to benefit from
any conceivable market situation. Since
this proposal also urges collaboration
with South Africa and New Zealand, the
Board hopes to see from season to season,
a world reserve, especially for Merino
wool.
Even so, the president of the Wool
Growers and Graziers’ Council, Mr T.
L. Bull, emphasised the Board’s rider that
a reserve price could not solve all the
industry’s problems. Changing circum-
stances must be met “by other variations
in ways of handling and selling wool.”
Sir William Gunn described the basic
reserve recommendation as “conservative”
and the report leaves a little vague the
constitution of an authority to fix the
average reserve. Any authority “must
function free from political or industry
pressures!”
• The full report will be closely analysed
in next week’s Bulletin.

Life at Jervis Bay
No longer turning Australian boys into Englishmen
By BATMAN
The drive down Kangaroo Valley at
night to HMAS Creswell, Royal
Australian Naval College, Jervis
Bay, can be unnerving. At any turn of
the bend the car is likely to collide with
some poor, terrified kangaroo. Then in
the early hours the guard at the gate is
likely to have his anxious moments.
Looking out into the blackness he is
inclined to see a pair of red eyes looking
back at him. It is just another kangaroo;
like the Duty Officer, doing his rounds.
The next major event comes at the
first glint of dawn, and this is an extra-
ordinary thing. The timing is so precise,
so instantaneous, it’s as if it were all
carried out under Naval Standing Orders.
Suddenly there’s an explosion of sound
coming from what must be 100 kooka-
burras. And the day is under way.
It is very easy to understand why the
Navy yearned to get back to Jervis Bay.
The place is beautiful. The Bay itself
looks as Sydney Harbor must have
looked in 1788, utterly unruined by
people. The beaches are pure white, and
the sand so fine it squeaks under foot.
There’s not a can, not a bottle, not an
ice-cream stick anywhere, and the
beaches are so clean one would swear it
was a Navy job to have them swept by
0900 hours daily.
The college is on Captain’s Point. The
buildings are pleasing to the eye, white,
red tiled, dominated just a little by the
rather fussy clock tower, which looks
for all the world like something out of
Disneyland. The parade ground is not
a hard, foot-stamping bitumen parade
ground. It is turf. This is the Quarter
Deck and it is soft and with the little
white pavilion to one side it smacks
more of a cricket green at Cambridge.
The history of RANC is interesting.
From 1910 to 1913 perhaps our earliest
naval battle was to find the right place
for the college. All sorts of places were
suggested such as Barrenjoey, near
Sydney; Port Hacking was another, and,
according to one story, Admiral Sir
Reginald Henderson, RN, who came to
Australia to report on the location of
naval bases and schools, even looked
at the site for Geelong Grammar at
Corio Bay. Such a gale was blowing on
the date of his visit he decided this was
no place for a naval college.
TTltimately the Fisher Government
decided on Jervis Bay. It was extremely
isolated, true, but this was the argument.
Jervis Bay was to be the port for the
National Capital. There would be a
railway line direct to Canberra and it
would be only a matter of time before
the naval college, on Australian Capital
Territory, would be part of a great and
flourishing area.
The dream never came true, and the
high cost of isolation hampered the
college from then on. First it had
temporary quarters, during 1913 and
1914, at Osborne House, an old boarding
house in Geelong.
Then it moved to Jervis Bay in 1915.
There was accommodation for over 150
students and with prospects of an ever
growing navy the future for the college
looked very rosy indeed. That is until
1920, when the very idea of a Navy was
looked upon as a needless luxury. The
intake dropped from 20, to 15, to 10 a
year. Through 1928 and 1929 Jervis
Bay was a favorite topic for the Opposi-
tion. One member claimed it was costing
£70,000 a year to run the college, there-
fore the price of one graduate was
£7OOO.
For weeks the political soothsayers in
Canberra wrote that the Scullin Govern-
ment had decided definitely to close
down the college. It was just a matter of
picking the right time for the announce-
ment. Much of the argument was on
the age-old point of signing up 13-year-
olds, and running what was really
nothing more than a public school at
Government expense. The Navy could
get officers of equal calibre by selecting
boys from the schools after they had
finished their leaving certificate.
But Mr Scullin remembered it was a
Labor Government that started this and
the idea was that a naval career should
be open to all; they didn’t merely want
the wealthy young gentlemen from
public schools. The Navy, too, believed
very much in this idea of “get ’em
young”.
On February 4, 1930, Vice-Admiral
Sir William Creswell, father of the RAN
and founder of RANG, wrote for the
newspapers: “A number of boys keen
at 12 to join the Navy will be wise
enough at 17i to inquire about the other
end of the naval career, to compare it
with other professions. In this corn


parison the Navy will take a very
modest place, so modest indeed as to be
a warning.
“The Navy’s chances of getting the
best of the boys of 171 are thus remote.”
There was talk of shifting Duntroon
to Jervis Bay, or vice versa, and com-
bining the two colleges, but finally the
big economy step came. On July 31,
1930, Jervis Bay was evacuated and
moved to Flinders Naval Base. There
was no intake at all in 1930 and 1931,
but 12 cadetships were offered in 1932.
So the college went into purgatory
for 28 years. It always felt it was only
an adjunct, an improvised set-up at
Flinders.
The honeymoon era
TV/leanwhile, Jervis Bay became one of
the finest resorts on the South Coast.
The Ward Room became the College
House Hotel, the Petty Officers’ Mess
the Naval Lodge Hotel, and there were
such comfortable establishments as
“Westward Ho”, “Jervis Bay House”,
“The Anchorage” and the Captain’s
house with its steps straight down on
to the white sands became the ideal nest
for honeymooners.
The move back on May 1, 1957,
caused almost as much political fuss as
the move out in 1930, but there’s no
question that the RANC is completely
happy now for the first time since 1918.
The RAN has nine ships on order, three
American missile - carrying destroyers,
four submarines and two Tl 2 frigates.
Naval officers at Jervis Bay are
badly needed. Last Friday was gradua-
tion day at RANC. The marigolds,
poppies, pansies and poinsettias were all
in bloom around the Quarter Deck.
Everything had been painted, polished,
clipped and brought to bloom like
Flemington on Cup Day. Thirty-one
graduated, and it was all done strictly
down the alphabetical list. Starting with
the A’s, the first 10 left by Qantas
Boeing on Monday to join Vampire and
Vendetta at Singapore. The next 16
joined Sydney, the next three Derwent
and the last two Anzac.
They feel the alphabetical system is
the fairest way of organising postings
at RANC. It was the same last year.
You may have noted that it was M’s,
like the former Chief Cadet Captain,
Midshipman Maunder, who died on
Voyager. Altogether eight of last year’s
graduates are dead, and there’s no point
in avoiding the truth, this is something
that is concerning everybody at the
college.
The night of the tragedy had its
bizarre aspects. While Melbourne and
Voyager were taking part in exercises
at sea, the First Year cadets at RANC
were being put through their initiation
ceremonies.
It was much the usual routine. They
were pelted with grease, tomato juice,
marmalade, Brasso and sump oil. They
were made to slither down greasy steps.
They were made, on their hands and
knees, to push a telegraph pole across
the Quarter Deck. Then they had to
carry the poles on their shoulders.
The final act was to be painted with
waterproof paint and go off the high
dive at the swimming pool. They were
under the shower trying to scrape off
that paint when first they heard the
sirens, and the rescue boats going off.
Through the night casualties began to
come back to the hospital and there
were rumors all over the college. The
initiation ceremonies had added to the
unreality of the night. Now they are
forbidden in Standing Orders and the
cadets will see them no more at RANC.
Next morning the Naval Officer in
Charge (NOIC), Captain Dacre Smyth,
announced at parade that there had been
a collision between Melbourne and
Voyager and half the ship’s company of
Voyager was missing. This was the first
official word from the Navy that there
had been large loss of life in the
accident and the announcement went
around the world.
Just to settle this matter it seemed
important to question both officers and
cadets as to whether there had been
loss of morale due to the disasters of
1963.
One cadet, a few days before gradua-
tion, said: “We were the next course,
I suppose we should have been affected
more than anyone by this. It certainly
made us grow up and be aware of the
dangers of Service life.. But loss of
morale? No. We feel what happened
was bad luck and we still think the Navy
is the best Service.”
One of the officers said: “If people
keep on saying there is a drop in morale
in the Navy, I suppose there will be,
but that’s not true at the moment. I
think there’s been a tightening, a new
determination to rise above this.”
As for recruiting, the position has
been most interesting. In the first
months there has been a large increase
in the numbers wanting to join the
Navy. The public relations office puts
it down to all the publicity, stories of
heroic actions, stories about sailors re-
turning to their home towns, and even
all the spread given to the Royal Com-
mission.
It was also interesting that the parents
of the eight cadets who died presented
a perpetual trophy to be known as the
Royal Australian Naval College Jubilee
Year Graduates Memorial Sword.
The interest from £5OO provides the
£25 to buy a Sword of Honor for the
midshipman who gets the best results
at the Seamanship Board after 12 months
at sea.
The character of the college has
changed over the years. In the old days
the officers were mostly RN and the
cadets came in at 13. In the photographs
there were always these poor little boys
in the huge white officer caps and one
would wonder, if when they turned their
heads, the caps would turn also.
An Admiral upon being asked to
recall these days said: “Really it was
an institution designed to turn small
Australian boys into Englishmen.” And
the college was run like an English
school right down to a perfectly trans-
planted system of fagging.
Senior cadets handed out corporal
punishment, and by tradition it was on
the behind with a gym shoe. One officer
at the college recalls that his posterior
tally for one term was 220 swipes.
Now there is no fagging and no cor-
poral punishment. What’s more the staff
is extremely young and eager. The
NOIC, Captain Dacre H. D. Smyth, an
old Geelong Grammar boy, is only 41.
The executive officer, Commander David
Leach, couldn't be more than 37.
£4O-a-week scholarships
Navy likes to talk of the RANC
course as one of the richest scholar-
ships in the country, worth £4O a week
for each cadet. Clothes, medical care and
travel are all free and the pay rises to
£7 a week. The 15-year-olds start off
with 10s. a week pocket money.
There have been no 13-year-olds since
1956. Now they come in at junior
entry and senior entry. For junior
entry they must be 141 to 161 on
January 1 of the year of entry and they
must be good enough to sit for their
matriculation in the second year. For
senior entry they must be under 19 on
January 1 and they must already have
their matriculation. They stay at the
college 11 years as opposed to 31 for
the juniors.
As with most colleges there is the
agony system of discipline at first, with
rising privileges as they get older. For
everybody the bugle goes at 6.25 a.m.
They have to be out in front of the
Quarter Deck by 6.27, and then there’s

Laporte...
where rubber
and chemicals
get together
Yet another mighty industry opens up in Western Australia. At Bunbury stands
the huge Laporte chemical plant, built to manufacture Titanium Oxide. In this
chemical process the protection requirements to various surfaces were
enormous. Under sub-contract from Bechtel Pacific Corporation Limited,
Dunlop was awarded the job of supplying the protective rubber linings . ..
over 80,000 lbs. of rubber . . . the biggest contract of its kind ever to be
awarded to a single company in Australia. Whatever needed protection
. . . metal, wood, brick or concrete against acids, abrasives, fumes, oils,
alkalis, solvents or gases . . . Dunlop had the answer. Other rubber com-
ponents supplied by Dunlop ranged from suction and delivery hoses,
conveyor belting, to gaskets and many types of mouldings. Whatever the
type of work, whatever the requirements . . . Dunlop products always do the job any job
they’re designed for.

PT or a 600-yard run round the Deck.
On a winter morning when it is as black
as the Middle Watch this is looked upon
with small enthusiasm.
When the cadets first enter they
proceed everywhere at all times “at the
double”. It’s a little tricky always learn-
ing to spot officers and salute, while
panting forward, but one learns. In the
first weeks cadets have to learn the
names of everyone at the college. For-
getfulness can be painful. A second-year
cadet is likely to step forward:
“What’s my name?”
“It’s . . . er . . . Mister . . .”
“The name’s Robinson, you idiot.
Off you go. Round the quarter deck,
FLY.”
So he pants off for another 600-yards
run.
He has to learn the Standing Orders
virtually by heart. He has to learn all
the dress rigs.
For example, rig 22 is “Seamen jersey,
white open neck shirt, grey flannels,
white socks, white gym shoes or black
shoes.” Rig 5 is: “Reefer jacket and
trousers, white shirt, stiff white collar,
black tie, black socks, black shoes and
cap.”
There is a choice of rigs: 5,7, 12a,
13, 13a, 14, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26. The
second-year cadets are likely to come
round and shout: “All right, into sevens,
FLY.”
Which means that one has to know
the meaning of SEVENS and one has
only two minutes to put them on. The
dreaded cry is into FIVES, which calls
for the starched white shirt and hard
collar and two minutes is barely long
enough.
Agony jobs
"CWery cadet has a cabin, but there
again the rig has to be perfect at all
times, for fear that the captain may be
doing his round. There’s a place for
everything. Drawers are known as tills.
If the captain opens the top right-hand
till, he expects to see the cap in the
centre with the cadet’s black and white
socks arranged around it in a circle. It
looks quite pretty actually, like a white
hen amongst its eggs.
Next till down he will expect to see
the shirts in three piles. The shirts will
be folded precisely to a width of 9in.
(Imagine the hell, when they come back
from the laundry starched to lOiin.)
Then between each beautifully geometric
pile there will be a width of three
fingers. This is a good cause for extra
drill because some fingers tend to be
thicker than others.
Then there are other agony jobs such
as cleaning the bathrooms, heads or
whatever.
The bathrooms must shine like the
sun for inspection. That is, they must
be wiped clean, not a molecule of water
left to be wiped by an inspecting finger.
This can be frustrating, particularly if
a senior cadet decides to take a shower
five minutes before inspection time.
As the cadets get older so life im-
proves. Progressively he is allowed to
wear civilian clothes at allotted times.
Instead of galloping everywhere, he is
allowed to march, and in his final year
he gets the privileges of a bar. The bar
is open from 1715 hours to 1815 hours
on Saturdays and from 1930 hours to
2030 hours on Sundays. He is allowed
to run up a bar bill of £1 a month, in
other words 20 beers. If he wanted to
he could get through his 20 beers on
the first night, but he would have the
prospect of an appalling drought for
the remainder of the month.
Then, as of this year, the senior cadets
have been allowed to own motor cars,
a major change from the old days when
the grand privilege was permission to
own a bicycle.
The college is utterly isolated. The
cadets are extremely lucky if ever they
see their parents during school time,
but for heaven’s sake, the place is
equipped like an American country
club. There are more tennis courts
than they can use, there’s a nine-hole
golf course, there’s the swimming pool,
and there’s training to be had on gliders.
As for boats there are 14 sailing
dinghies, five 27ft. whalers, three fast
motor boats, two motor cutters and two
catamarans.
For the big stuff there’s Franklin, a
43ft. sloop-rigged ocean-going yacht,
Tam O’Shanter, a 33ft ocean-going yacht
and Sabrina, a 23ft Derwent-class yacht.
The cadets go off in the big yachts for
weekend trips around the Bay. On a
Friday evening I saw four senior cadets
setting out in Tam O’Shanter. Judging
from the steaks, eggs, bread, etc., they
had stowed, one would have thought
they were setting out for Mawson.
Actually they are allowed out on all
sorts of weekend trips. They camp,
they go by Land-Rover, bicycle or,
rather rarely one suspects, by foot.
The Director of Studies is Dr H. E.
Dykes, B.Sc, Ph.D, MI, Mech.E, Dip.Ed
a former captain instructor, RN, a man
remarkably well qualified for his job
The problems of how to train a young
man so that he becomes an electronic-
engineering academic and at the same
time retains an enthusiasm for the sea
are far from easy. Presumably he has to
be fairly dedicated, to want to spend
half his life time at sea, but to make him
useful on a missile-carrying destroyer
takes anything up to nine years of train-
ing.
Courses in England
HThis is the way it is done now. Matricu-
A lation comes in the second year,
then in the third year cadets are divided
into a science stream and a humanities
stream. They get what amounts to a
year’s post-matriculation study and three
months’ training on Anzac, but even so
the feeling is that before they study any
further the sailors must be allowed to
get their hands on a real ship. So they
graduate as midshipmen in July of the
fourth year and they go to sea for 12
months. Then they become acting sub-
lieutenants and they go to England.
The Humanities men do a year’s
course at the Royal Naval College at
Dartmouth, then courses at various shore
establishments. The engineers and elec-
trical experts do a three-year degree
course at the RN engineering college,
Manadon, Plymouth, followed by a 12
months’ naval equipment course.
This makes for an extraordinary
union between the two navies. Any
RAN officer who reaches the rank of
commander serves at least two terms in
England, either doing courses or serving
as an exchange officer. It is just like
being in a vast club. It is said that no
matter where you serve, RN or RAN,
you will be on first-name terms with
someone you knew in college days.
How long this will last is anybody’s
guess. Inevitably, as we depend more
and more on the US and buy equip-
ment from the US, our ties should swing
closer to the US Navy. Of course it
would be more efficient and quicker if
the cadets could get their degrees in
Australia, and every college dreams of
becoming a degree-conferring institution.
But at this stage the RANC obviously
is too small to rate the instructors and
the expense of it all. Then there’s the
Junior Entry, another subject for argu-
ment in the Ward Room. Many officers
feel the time has come when they should
forget the 15-year-olds, bring them all
in at 17, as at Duntroon, and double the
turnover. But this creates another fear,
the same fear that Admiral Creswell had
back in 1930. If you don’t get ’em
young you mightn’t get ’em at all. The
competition for bright 17-year-olds is
fierce. They have noted this often.

When they ask a boy what he would do
if he failed to get into RANC, he may
reply: “Well, sir, I have also put in
papers for cadetships with BHP, IQ,
Shell, Duntroon and Burns Philp.”
Certainly there is more opportunity
for all if they come in at 15, but that
wasn’t the only reason. In the old days
there was the fear that unless the Navy
got boys at a tender age it would be
impossible to turn them into real gentle-
men. That belief is virtually done. Six
of this year’s graduates came in under
the Upper Yardmen scheme. They were
former ratings who showed uncommon
ability and were sent to Jervis Bay for
officer training. Then there’s the Top
Men system. The Navy very carefully
runs an eye over all young apprentices.
Those who look good are sent to
Leeuwin in Western Australia where, if
they get their matriculation, they, too,
come on to Jervis Bay.
VTot everybody likes the possibility of
being retired as a lieutenant com-
mander at 45, even though he does get
to a salary of more than £3OOO a year
before allowances. Nor does he look
forward to spending half his life away
from home. Every Navy officer spends
a year at sea then a year ashore. It is
necessary to look around, sometimes
almost desperately, for high quality
recruits. But failure rate at Jervis Bay
is 20 per cent, although for the course
just graduated it was higher, nearer to
50 per cent. So the bait goes out. Head-
masters are invited to Jervis Bay to
look the place over. In January there is
a seven-day summer camp for 50 school-
boys from five States, just to get them
interested in the RANC. All that is
required is a recommendation from a
headmaster, and the Navy pays the
fares. According to the application form
there’s no obligation to join the Navy.
Yet as they tell you at every turn at
the RANC, Australia is an island nation,
in a very lonely position in the Com-
monwealth, and as long as there is a
sea and ships we will need a navy. And
they are hopeful, too, that there will
always be young men who are fascinated
by ships and they will join up regard-
less of the attractions elsewhere.
There is little doubt, too, that the
Royal Australian Naval College in its
holiday home setting at Jervis Bay looks
like the most beautifully equipped public
school we ever saw. Indeed we remem-
ber one of the RANC cooks talking
with uncommon enthusiasm: “What do
I think of this place? Look, mate. This
is the best draft in the Navy. Only a
few years back people were paying 17
guineas a week for holidays here. Now
the Government’s paying me!”


OUT AND ABOUT
Dobell: Retrospective, Introspective
“I doubt whether contemporary painters rate my work very highly"
As Wep saw the 1944 Dobell Art Case
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
I asked William Dobell whether his
current retrospective exhibition made
him feel like the Grand Old Man of
Australian Art. He pondered for a
moment before replying. He always
does sniff round a question cautiously
before answering, for fear of being mis-
understood. Dobell is not happy talking
in generalities, anyway.
“I don’t believe any young artist has
much respect for Grand Old Men,” he
said. “I doubt whether contemporary
Australian painters rate my work very
highly. I’m essentially a conservative,
a traditionalist. They’re interested in
quite different forms of expression. They
probably think I'm very much behind
the times.”
He said it without a shade of resent-
ment. It would have been remarkable,
he implied, if it had been otherwise.
We were drinking tea in Dobell’s house
at Wangi, looking out through a big
plate-glass window at the grey, westerly-
whipped water of Lake Macquarie.
“I hate this wind,” Dobell said, as a
particularly violent gust seemed to shake
the whole house. “Storms upset me. I
get restless and can’t do any work. I’m
a nervous sort of bloke really.” He saw
me looking vaguely round for an ashtray
and dropped his own cigarette butt into
his teacup. “It’s a terrible habit,” he
said. “I have a lot of bad habits. Lazi-
ness is one of them. 1 have to drive
myself up to the studio to get on with
my work.
“What were we talking about? Con-
temporary painters—l like some of their
work very much. Especially the ab-
stracts. I feel I have something to learn
from them; in fact I’ve already learned
quite a lot. But I don’t understand
what some of them are trying to do.
And I can’t make head or tail of what
the art critics say about them. That’s
one reason, apart from laziness, why I
rarely go to look at contemporary art
shows. I like artists, you know, but I
prefer them when they’re not talking
about art. I don’t seem to be speaking
the same language. When I’ve been
with them I come away full of confused
impressions and ideas and 1 have to get
back to my own work as quickly as
possible.”
Dobell doesn't believe he has had much
influence on young Australian painters.
“I think perhaps I had at one time,
when I was teaching at the Tech, more
than 20 years ago,” he said. “Young
painters were still interested in line and
draughtsmanship then. I enjoyed teach-
ing but I couldn’t do it now. Anyway,
portrait painting doesn’t attract many
young artists nowadays. Perhaps it will
come back again, but it doesn’t look like
it at the moment.”
Dobell accepts the fact that he is re-
garded primarily as a portrait painter,
though he accepts it with mild irritation.
Only in the last few years has he begun
to feel financially secure and able to
please himself what he paints. “I don’t
know whether it is a good thing,” he
said. “I'm a disorderly, unorganised
sort of worker. Perhaps I need a defi-
nite job to be done.”
After talking to Dobell for a while it
is easy to believe this. At first meeting
anyone less like the conventional tem-
peramental artist it would be hard to
imagine. He seems placid, perfectly
relaxed, benevolently at ease in the little
world he has created for himself at
Wangi. He has no affectations of man-
ner. He spoke to me with a slow, de-

liberate casualness, pulling affectionately
at the ears of the cocker spaniels that
bounced round his paint-smeared cor-
duroys. (“I like playing the piano,” he
remarked wistfully, “but I’ve had to
give it up because the dogs start howling
as soon as I begin.”) He smiles fre-
quently, sometimes a rather sly smile as,
with a twinkle behind his spectacles, he
relates some entirely unprintable anec-
dote about a famous sitter, a dealer or a
fellow-painter. He looks the picture of
unruffled good humor.
Yet an interviewer is soon aware that
Dobell is a much more complicated
character than this. All sorts of worries
and inhibitions begin to peep out in his
conversation. He is not a robust man,
physically or emotionally. He admits to
an almost morbid sensitivity to criticism
and, though he denies it, one can’t help
wondering whether the Archibald Prize
uproar over Joshua Smith did not per-
manently affect his not very fully de-
veloped self-confidence.
The court case that followed the 1944
Archibald award drove Dobell into a
nervous breakdown and left him incap-
able of serious work for a year. He is
still haunted by his experience in the
witness box and the flood of abusive
letters and telephone calls he received.
“When I was commissioned to paint
Lord Wakehurst I leaned over back-
wards to provide what I thought was
wanted,” he said. “I was determined
that nobody would call that painting a
caricature.”
Worries and anxieties
I>y the time Dobell won his second
Archibald Prize with his portrait of
Margaret 01 ley the storm had long blown
over and the celebrated court case had
become one of the most ludicrous epi-
sodes in Australian art history. Dobell
was well on his way to becoming fashion-
able. “I could have made pots of money
out of commissions after that,” Dobell
said. “But I don't really like painting
portraits. I make hard work of them
because I worry about them so much.
t J s bad enough having to satisfy yourself,
but I’m always terribly anxious about
what the subjects and all their friends
and relatives are going to think of the
result.
“When I'm painting a subject simply
because it attracts me I can just work to
please myself. That’s why I prefer
paintings like ‘The Strapper’, ‘The
Cypriot’ and ‘Mrs South Kensington’ to
most of the set pieces. Perhaps portrait
painting should be left to the purely
representational artists you know,
paintings for Town Halls and board-
rooms and so on.”
Newspaper editor Brian Penton, him-
self the subject of one of Dobell’s best-
known portraits, once said that Dobell
was fascinated by the ugly surface of
life, that his painting showed a con-
flicting horror of and delight in the crude
flesh. Dobell disclaims the idea, not
altogether convincingly. To say that he
is repelled by humanity would be grotes-
quely unfair, but he fears and dislikes
some of humanity’s manifestations in-
tensely. He is not very articulate about
it in words.
“I just don’t like important people very
much,” he says simply. He means the
powerful, the pretentious and the pom-
pous. In the presence of loud talk, con-
fident platitude and intellectual postur-
ing he dries up completely.
Dobell denies the familiar charge that
he looks for the abnormal in his subjects
and deliberately accentuates it. “I look
for what makes a character an indivi-
dual, different from any other indivi-
dual,” he said. “Often it is more what
they say and how they behave than any
sort of physical thing. I like to talk
to my sitters first and try to understand
them. After that, when I’m actually
painting, I don't want to see too much
of them. I prefer to work alone, using
sketches, photographs and my memory.
I painted Scotty Allen entirely from
memory.
“The main thing is to get the feel of
the character. If you’ve got a good
visual memory you don't need the sub-
ject sitting there in front of you all the
time. Of course you sometimes have to
take liberties to create the picture you
want. Joshua Smith was a very thin
man, so I tightened the clothing on his
arms to bring this out. That’s not cari-
cature, as some critics said. It’s one of
the tricks of the business.”
I asked Dobell what he would do if
he were completely independent finan-
cially (won the Opera House lottery,
for instance) and could afford not to
give a damn whether he sold another
painting. “If I had tons of money and
my health would stand it, I’d like to live
in India or the East for a while,” he
said. “I sometimes wish I had been
born an Oriental. Eastern art fascinates
me. I like the patterns and the wonder-
ful sense of line. I tried to get some-
thing of the Oriental quality into my
New Guinea paintings. I still have
piles of drawings and small stuff from
New Guinea that I'd like to work up
into paintings some day.
“I would have gone on with them
before but for the criticism when some
of them were shown in 1954. The
David Jones gallery wanted an exhibi-
tion when the Queen was out here and
all I had on hand were some of my
small New Guinea paintings. One of
the critics proceeded to write me off as
a ‘miniaturist’, and that put me off them
for a long time. That shows how
criticism used to get under my skin and
upset me. I’m not quite so susceptible
now.”
Dobell had a studio at Kings Cross
for some years after he returned from
England in 1939, but for about 15 years
he has lived and worked at Wangi, on
Lake Macquarie, about 100 miles north
of Sydney. The house, originally a two-
room week-ender built by his father,
has been transformed by the addition
of an upstairs studio and a wide-win-
dowed sitting-room overlooking the lake.
Dobell’s elderly sister housekeeps for
him.
His tastes are simple, though he en-
joys a bottle of good wine with the
Wine and Food Society when he is in
Sydney. “I have to watch his diet,”
his sister says. “There are things he
can’t eat since he had that illness a few
years ago. He’s too polite to say so
when he’s dining out and sometimes he
suffers for it afterwards.”
“The Dead Landlord”
11/angi is a pleasant spot and Dobell
™ likes the way his neighbors casually
accept him as Bill Dobell, one of the
locals.
Nevertheless, Dobell is beginning to
feel a little restless in his environment.
“I miss a lot up here,” he said. “I
couldn’t live in the middle of the city.
The city terrifies me. But I’d like to
live close enough to go to theatres and
see more of my friends. I’m not natu-
rally the hermit type.”
Dobell has compromised by buying an
old house on the outskirts of Sydney at
Castle Hill, though he has not yet made
up his mind about settling there. He
quite obviously fears that leaving Wangi
would somehow be a surrender of his
privacy. “I suppose I’m too old and
unadventurous to change my habits too
much,” he said.
Dobell often refers nostalgically to his
10 years in London before the war, when
he painted “Mrs South Kensington,”
“The Dead Landlord,” and the Cockney
street characters he saw every day
around his shabby lodgings.
“Patrick White got the idea for his
play from The Dead Landlord’,” said
Dobell, “but it’s not generally known that
he got the name for it too. ‘The Dead
Landlord’ was to have been one of a
series, like Hogarth’s ‘Rake’s Progress,’
with the general title of ‘The Ham Fune-
ral.’ I never got round to doing the rest
of the paintings, but, when I told Patrick
about it, he was so taken with the name
that he appropriated it.”
I suggested that Dobell might find an
equally rich gallery of Hogarthian types
round Woolloomooloo and Paddington.
“Perhaps,” he said dubiously. “But I
wouldn’t work at the Cross again. Too
many interruptions and distractions.”


A Day with Otto
Genius in the sun
By WALLACE CROUCH
Otto Preminger had a problem.
“Danny,” he barked. Assistant
director Danny McCauley jumped.
“Danny,” said Mr Preminger, “I can see
the Arizona Memorial. In 1941 there
was no Arizona Memorial in Pearl
Harbor. Danny, let's do something
about it, quick-like.”
Perched on a camera-boom 30 feet
above the sugar-cane field Mr Prem-
inger's eyes had slowly, meticulously
embraced the scene in front of him—-
the one his Panavision camera was about
to record. Below, some four miles
away, in the shimmering heat of mid-
morning lay Pearl Harbor—a sprawling
complex of waterways and warships,
buildings and islands, looking pretty
much as it did on the early morning of
December 7, 1941, when through a gap
in the mountains behind where we now
stood the first wave of Japanese bomb-
ers thundered in.
With one exception. On the Day of
Infamy the US battleship Arizona
rode at anchor. Now she was a rust-
ing hulk in the mud of Pearl Harbor,
more than 1000 sailors still entombed in
her. Above her grave stood a great
white stone arch, a memorial shrine
which thousands of tourists visit. From
our vantage point the memorial appear-
ed as only a sliver of white. But to
Preminger it was an irritating blot on a
landscape he wanted to appear as it
was that violent Sunday morning.
A minute's hard thinking and Danny
McCauley had a solution to suit his
boss. He'd have the workmen hoist up
a couple of telephone poles in the cane-
field. That way the camera wouldn’t
pick up the memorial as it swept the
scene.
Mr Preminger grinned in satisfaction.
He ordered the camera-crane lowered,
unhitched the airline safety belt on his
seat, swept off his panama hat, walked
jauntily towards us, and said, “Very
well, gentlemen, it will take a little time.
I am now ready for my Australian tele-
vision debut.”
We—Raymond, executive producer of
TCN-9’s Project ’64 team, cameraman
Peter Leyden, sound recorder John
Oakley and myself—had just wound up
a solid week’s work on a TV docu-
mentary about the submarine menace in
the Pacific. Everything had gone very
well. The Americans had turned on
everything—trips in destroyers and sub-
marines, detailed briefings by the US
Pacific Fleet's anti-submarine warfare
chief, Admiral John T. Hayward, plenty
of local color. But we needed some-
thing to start the show with a bang.
That evening's edition of the Honolulu
“Star-Bulletin” had the answer. Otto
Preminger was in Honolulu to make a
film. Called “In Harm's Way”, it was
to be based on a best-selling novel about
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and
subsequent events involving a group of
Navy officers. The cast included John
Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Dana Andrews,
Patricia Neal, Burgess Meredith, Fran-
chot Tone, Tom Tryon and Brandon de
Wilde. Stanley Holloway, fresh from
his stage and film success as Doolittle in
“My Fair Lady”, was to portray an Aus-
tralian wartime coast-watcher.
We wrote to Preminger. In answer
we got a phone call from his publicity
man, Nat Rudick, asking us to be at
Preminger's headquarters, the Ilikai
Hotel, within half an hour.
Mr Rudick told us that Mr Preminger
could spare us five minutes. We went
up to a tastefully furnished apartment.
Preminger was having lunch. He care-
fully sliced a grapefruit as he talked —
a shortish, balding man of 58, with ice-
blue eyes and the deliberate accent and
courteous manners of his native Vienna.
From law to footlights
rpms was the man who had begun as a
lawyer but had been lured to the
stage by Max Reinhardt, who had run up
a series of Broadway successes before
making, in 1944, his first big Hollywood
success, “Laura”. The man who had
startled the film capital with his individ-
ual thinking and his hiring of writers
from America’s so-called “Hollywood
Ten”—a blacklist of people accused of
Communist or fellow-travelling sym-
pathies. This was the man who had
bucked Hollywood’s Establishment by
becoming an independent producer-
director and turning out such box-office
successes as “The Moon is Blue”, “Car-
men Jones”, “Porgy and Bess”, “The
Man with the Golden Arm”, “Advise and
Consent” and “The Cardinal”.
Now Mr Preminger delivered his ver-
dict. He would say a few words in front
of the camera to introduce our docu-
mentary. He would also speak to Mr
Wayne about the idea. We would have
to be at tomorrow morning’s shooting
location—at eight sharp.
So here we were, in the sugar-cane
overlooking Pearl Harbor, all ready to
shoot. It was getting hotter and every-
one looked ruffled, everyone, that is,
except Preminger, cucumber-cool in blue
shirt, brown slacks and white sneakers,
Raymond had prepared some “idiot
boards” Mr Preminger’s dialogue
scrawled in crayon on pieces of card-
board. The man from Hollywood didn’t
seem put out by such hasty improvisa-
tion. Peter Leyden set his camera whir-
ring, John Oakley switched on his tape-
recorder and Raymond stepped in front
of Mr Preminger, said, “Mr Preminger’s
introduction. Take One,” and slapped
his hands together as though they were
a clapper-board.
Preminger’s voice cut the silence. “One
moment, Mr Raymond. No need for
that. I've been in this business a long
time. Let me do it my way.” Ray-
mond grinned and stepped aside. Ley-
den pressed his camera button again.
And Otto Preminger stepped forward,
took off his hat, and said: “Otto Pre-
minger. Take One. ... I am Otto Pre-
minger and I am here in Hawaii making
a film. . . .”
Preminger walked away, grinning.
“One take Preminger, they call me,” he
said.
We stayed on the location for almost
the rest of the day. There was a lot
to see. A big, burly man, the transport-
master, with a voice like that of a Marine
top sergeant, kept up a stream of abuse
at a fleet of trucks and cars milling
around, roaring their motors, kicking up
dust. “The goddam camera’ll pick you
up,” he yelled. “Get down to the bot-
tom of the hill.” He came over to us.
“What a louse up. I’ve had a stinking
headache since I jetted in here 10 days
ago. Didja know we’ve had to hire
fifteen 1941 Fords and Buicks at 20
bucks a day. Twenty bucks a day for
three months. When we leave the
louses’ll probably sell the beat-up bombs
for 60 bucks apiece.”
But dominating all and everyone was
Otto Preminger.
I went over and spoke to him. In
Hollywood films screened in Australia,
I explained, actors often spoke with what
they thought was an Australian accent —
but with hilarious effects on local audi-
ences. Now Stanley Holloway was
playing an Australian coast-watcher in
his film. A fine character actor, Mr
Holloway. But was he going to use the
Cockney accent of his “My Fair Lady”
days?
“Right,” said Mr Preminger. “Is
there an Australian here in Honolulu
who can tutor Mr Holloway in the Aus-
tralian accent?” There was, I said. A
young Royal Australian Naval officer,
Lieut.-Commander Peter James, attach-
ed to Admiral Hayward's headquarters.
Mr Preminger called over a female
script-assistant who was clutching a book
entitled “Hawaii’s War Years”. “Give
her the name and address of the officer,”
said Mr Preminger. “And thanks.”


OVERSEAS
It was Barry all the Way
"AuH2O + GOP + 64 = Victory." In November too?
From PETER COLEMAN in San Francisco
J|Y> veteran journalists it was a dull
convention. From the word go
everything went as expected; there were
no surprise stories, and of all the Eastern
Goldwater delegates Rockefeller,
Lodge, Stassen, Scranton —only Scranton
put up a real fight. Yet every attack he
made on Goldwater —on his foreign
policy, his Civil Rights stand, his impul-
siveness—seemed only to produce more
delegates for Goldwater.
In desperation Scranton, shooting from
the hip, sent off his famous letter to
Goldwater without writing, seeing or
signing it, but still acknowledging it, in
which he accused Goldwater of irres-
ponsibility, contempt for delegates and
reading Taft, Lincoln and Eisenhower
out of the party. Goldwaterites immedi-
ately circulated copies of the letter to all
delegates and the few remaining waverers
deserted Scranton.
Then Eisenhower arrived in San Fran-
cisco making speeches which, by not
attacking Goldwater, became a tacit
defence of him. After that it was all
over. The roll call of State delegations
on the third night had the atmosphere
of a vote that could be taken on the
first morning. It was a Goldwater push-
over, and only when South Carolina
“humbly” cast its vote putting Goldwater
over the hill was there a stir of excite-
ment.
When the vote finished, Scranton
appeared on the podium, urged his sup-
porters to recast their vote for “coming
President Goldwater” which most did,
except mainly for New York's Rocke-
fellerites who abstained so that there
would be apparent unanimity without
their joining in. As delegates walked out
into the foggy late evening San Francisco
air they were excited, but with none of
the elation that comes from an un-
expected triumph.
Even Civil Rights “lie-ins” seemed sub-
dued as Republicans stepped over prone
bodies singing “We shall overcome”. In
Press buses returning to hotels and offices
reporters chatted idly about this and that
while, elsewhere, Goldwater critics like
Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal and Mort
Sahl had little more to say. Only his
partisans, like John Dos Passos, spoke
of his new revival of faith in American
politics.
The obvious and inevitable had
happened, and it only remained to select
the Vice-Presidential candidate, hear
acceptance speeches next day and tidy
up the mess, which included thousands
of empty cans of yellow ginger ale called
“Gold Water”; hundreds of posters
sloganed “AuH 2 0 -4- GOP 64 ==
victory”; “Virginia, home of extremist
Patrick Henry, loves Barry”; “La Loui-
sane dit allons avec l’Eau d'Or”; “Gold-
water is a rat fink”; and thousands of
gold-yellow dresses and false, black eyes
worn by Goldwater women with badges
saying “We’d rather fight than switch.”
But if it was a journalistically dull
convention it was an historic one. It
represented not only a victory for the
conservatives but a decisive shift of the
Republican party from the North East to
the West and South West. It introduced,
if only temporarily, a real ideological
division into US politics and put an end,
if only temporarily, to “Me-Too” Re-
publicanism. Victorious conservatives
now have their chance, and if they are
not soundly licked in November —few of
them seriously hope to win they will
control the direction of the party for
years.
After all last week’s turgid oratory,
even after the well-rehearsed, 29-minute
paroxysm that greeted Senator Everett
Dirksen’s nomination of Senator Gold-
water (for the “New York Times’ ”
Brooks Atkinson, who covered the con-
vention as a theatre critic, Dirksen’s
speech was its high point), after all the
gold confetti had been showered and re-
frains of “Hello Barry, Here We Come”
had died away, there were two significant
silences and one dramatic tumult which
brought out the character of this con-
vention.
The first silence was that of the well-
oiled Goldwater machine. Scranton and
his supporters tried desperately to pick a
fight, but the well-disciplined Goldwater-
ites, keeping in touch by walkie-talkie,
kept things under control. For four to
eight years, the Goldwater machine has
been growing from the county court-
house level upwards.
It has a colossal youth following—-
according to some observers, one of the
most striking things in US politics since
FDR’s early days; and it now has its
intellectuals organised, principally around
the weekly “National Review”,
Attacked, Scranton complained that
they had provoked the shot from the
hip, but assembled Goldwaterites would
only listen in polite silence.
Only Rockefeller broke through the
silence in the Bastille Day debate on the
party platform. But on this occasion it
was the gallery, not delegates, that ex-
ploded. When he attacked Californian
“kooks” the largely Californian gallery
booed until the Governor of New York,
himself a candidate for nomination, could
not be heard. The delegates themselves
sat in stony silence. Otherwise the whole
operation had the silence of the push-
over.

Not as indigestible as it sounds!
Your after-dinner portion of “blue
vein” cheese owes its delicious
flavour and distinctive bouquet
to COPPER! Copper wires
strategically inserted in the
cheese while curing produce the
results so much beloved by
gourmets and others.
Copper of course goes into places
considered more important by all
except perhaps the gourmet!
Statistics tell us there’s a copper
consumption of 15 lb. a head of
Australia’s population. Over half
of this goes to various branches
of the electrical industry
eommunications, electronics,
light, power and household
appliances. About one-sixth is
used by the building industry
to make everything from water
pipes to door hinges. Road and
rail transportation accounts for
another twelve per cent, while
one-tenth is taken by industry
to make machine tools and equip-
ment and to alloy other metals.
A further six per cent is absorbed
by defence requirements and the
balance is used in a host of
ways, including the manufacture
of fertilisers and a wide range
of domestic needs including lip-
stick holders and light fittings.
This matchless versatility of
copper and copper alloys, with
their special significance in the

The second big silence was that over
the white backlash over Civil Rights.
Civil Rights demonstrations started the
day before the convention when some
30,000 marchers, covering nine blocks,
paraded through San Francisco chanting
“Goldwater must go”.
At the Cow Palace, demonstrators
marched night and day throughout the
whole convention and at night staged
“lie-ins” to block traffic, shouting “We
want to be arrested”, but there were no
serious incidents, no arrests, no provo-
cations accepted. Of course, after each
session they dominated the TV screen
throughout America. But Goldwaterites
were still silent.
This is their touchiest problem. The
unspoken issue of the convention was the
white backlash the potential white
Democrat vote in North as well as
South that may turn Republican in oppo-
sition to excesses of the Civil Rights
movement. Many Goldwaterites say they
hope that Governor Wallace of Alabama
will stand for President because that
would siphon off the racist bigots and
leave only the responsible elements to
vote Republican. But, in fact, they know
they will need every southern vote they
can get.
They will include the racists and for
the proud party of Lincoln this is hard
to swallow. In the split between Civil
Rights and States’ Rights, the conserva-
tives have swung to States’ Rights. They
are committed to the Civil Rights Bill by
their platform—and no one seriously
accuses Goldwater of racism, only of be-
ing prepared to benefit from it —but they
are in no position to crusade on it, hence
the silence despite all the provocation
and challenge.
T*he one unexpected tumult that mark-
ed the convention exploded during
General Eisenhower’s speech at the Cow
Palace. Speaking rapidly, as if expecting
no particular reaction, he referred scath-
ingly in passing to sensation-seeking
columnists and commentators. The Cow
Palace suddenly rocked with applause. A
surprised Eisenhower waited about two
minutes for the noise to subside and
added “. . . who could not care less about
the good of our party”. The paroxysm
started again, reporters in the Press
galleries stared at each other in astonish-
ment, genuinely unaware just how hostile
to them the Goldwaterites were. This is
not merely because some of the keenest
Scranton supporters among reporters
have never voted Republican in their lives
and could not seriously claim Scranton
would have any chance of beating the
Democrats. It is more because most
reporters, while accurately reporting the
convention, seemed seriously to have mis-
judged at least one big section of the
Goldwaterite movement. To begin with
they missed the main story of the year

when, concentrating on the contest from
the New Hampshire to the California
primaries, they ignored the expansion
elsewhere of the Goldwaterite movement.
But, however one explains Goldwater
followers’ hostility to the Press, the
one thing they do not appreciate is the
hostility of pressmen to Goldwater who,
in case after case, insists that the most
conscientious reporters have maliciously
misreported him. Few politicians have
alleged they have been so deliberately
misquoted.
Having got their hero the nomination,
what chance has the Republican Party
of winning in November? Very small
indeed. Their strategy is clear enough.
They will have little success in the East
and big-city states, so they must win in
the South (except where it is impossible
as in the solidly Democratic Mississippi
Alabama and Georgia and where, in any
case, Wallace may do well) and in the
Middle West, Rocky Mountain States
and, above all, in California, which has
40 electoral college votes but which now
has a Democratic Governor.
Their chances of victory are slimmer
still with President Johnson a more
popular leader than Kennedy and with
unprecedented prosperity in the country,
In view of this, and since Goldwater
is not very good at wisecracks, let the
Republican vice - presidential nominee
representative Miller, have the last word:
“Barry is a Jew and an Episcopalian. I
am a Catholic. Anyone who is against
our ticket is a bigot.”
Victory for the Dissidents
“T/ie Kingmakers ” were outmanoeuvred
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN in San Francisco
rpHE Republican Convention in San
A Francisco was as predictable as the
behavior of a bore. It ran its appointed
turbulent course under the remorseless
and highly professional control of the
Goldwater machine. But the fact remains
that it has been an intensely significant
convention.
One of America’s two great political
parties has been given an entirely new
leadership and perhaps a wholly new
direction for its future course. A radical
conservatism has taken charge,
It is a victory for the dissident and
disgruntled. It is a victory for passionate
nationalism. It is a revolt against the
former establishment, the wealthy state
governors and kingmakers of the east
coast cities. It is also in part a revolt of
whites, exasperated by or frightened of
the Negro revolt. It comes from a sector
of society that, except in the Deep South,
is scarcely heard from. It is of colossal
importance.
The victory is not the result of a
revolt of a majority of the Republican
Party. It fully represents as yet almost
certainly only a minority of the minor-
ity party. It was the result of brilliant
organisation, of the fact that Senator
Barry Goldwater arrived with the votes
of party delegations sewn up in the
lining of his coat. He has worked for
four years for this, and his success is
perfectly legitimate.
Barry Goldwater has built up a
national organisation in a manner that
improved even on the Kennedy tech-
nique, but which was less dramatic and
less noticeable.
It was an extraordinary spectacle, and
history will have much to say of it. It
has been one of the great personal
triumphs of American politics. Senator
Goldwater utterly dominated the whole
affair. Great political leaders arrived with
traditional democratic splendors and set
up headquarters like plenipotentiaries in
vast suites in the various shining, imper-
sonal hotels of this city. They conferred
and visited and issued statements and
held Press conferences and made alli-
ances, but it is clear that they waited
too long to act, underestimated the Gold-
water strength, and took their own
established authority for granted. They
were hopelessly outmanoeuvred and
none of them has been left in a position
of dignity.
President Eisenhower came to play
the wise old man and elder statesman. In
fact he did little except to compromise
his own record by his tacit and devious
approval of what Goldwater stands for.
He himself stood for nothing except
party unity.
If public opinion polls can be believed
and they are usually accurate within
a degree or two Goldwater has no
chance whatever of being elected Presi-
dent in November. But the very fact of
being candidate enhances and increases
a man.
The new nature of the Republican
Party makes his eventual achievement a
matter of complete uncertainty. The
great change in American politics is fun-
damentally irrational, but none the less
potent for that. It would be unwise
wholly to dismiss Barry Goldwater. He
might well get as much as 45 per cent
of the votes in the Presidential election.

FORULI
The Defamation Bill - 1
Who says the dead have no rights?
By a Special Correspondent
Opposition of authors to the De-
famation Bill of 1958 has again
surged up in Sydney. A scathing
Press letter from Norman Lindsay fore-
cast an inquisition on the legislators
who inaugurated it. His letter moved
the Attorney-General, Mr Downing, to
defend the Bill on two counts:
1. It was merely the codification of the
law as made by “its author in this
country, Sir Samuel Griffiths (sic)”.
2. Criticism of the Bill “provided its
own justification” for the Govern-
ment’s decision to enact it.
This drew a sharp reply from Dr Colin
Roderick, who listed Henry Lawson
scrapbooks in the Mitchell Library from
which pages had been officially excised
after the Bill had received the Governor’s
assent and accused the Attorney-General
of confused thinking on the Bill. Mr
Downing characterised Roderick’s con-
clusions as “surmise”.
It would be hypocritical to pretend
that Sydneysiders have ever believed the
Bill was brought in for the general good.
From Press letters, published corres-
pondence, cartoons, backroom gossip
and Parliamentary references to “the
pay-off”, the conclusion was that the
chief purpose of the Bill was to protect
the memory of the muck-raking John
Norton, one-time editor of “Truth”,
whose diverting activities were about to
be published in Cyril Pearl’s historical
study, “Wild Men of Sydney”. The Aus-
tralian Royal Historical Society at the
time urged the Government to remit the
Bill to a Select Committee.
Mr Vernon Treatt, QC, gave the
opinion in the House that under the Bill
a dead man could be called a drunk and
his son could take action for damages
for the defamation.
The Historical Society feared that
publishers, printers and booksellers, in
their anxiety to avoid risk of action,
would refuse to handle the results of
some historical work.
rpHE Society did not share Attorney-
General Downing’s reverence for Sir
Samuel Griffith and considered it un-
wise that “a nineteenth-century colonial
Australian attitude, long since outgrown
socially, should even appear to influence
a mid-twentieth-century approach to a
codification of the defamation law”.
Mr Downing was forced to admit that
a new edition or reprint of a book after
the Bill was passed would constitute
publication and could lay author and
publisher open to action. For publica-
tion in the legal sense is not the same
as in the literary sense. Put simply, it
means to make available to a third party.
It applies to the librarian as much as to
the bookseller.
If the influence of the bad aspects of
the Defamation Act were restricted to
books printed and offered for sale, we
might learn to rub along with it. What
we’ve never had we never miss.
When in 1958 Mr Asher Joel in the
Legislative Council condemned the Bill
as a Cannon-Ball and Grapeshot Bill
derived from the 1860 Penal Code of
India, Mr Downing defended the Indian
Code as reproducing “in a concise and
even beautiful form” the spirit of the
law of England.
A good reason, no doubt, for the
United States revolutionaries to go to
Gallic law for their law of defamation;
but let us see how accurate Mr Downing
was.
There is reason to doubt whether
Griffith, in codifying the English law,
did in fact confine himself to the Indian
Penal Code.
If we look at the definition of de-
famatory matter in the New South Wales
Code of 1958 and in the Indian Penal
Code of 1860, we find that we are more
restricted as to freedom of speech than
the sepoys were under colonial rule.
The New South Wales definition says:
“Any imputation concerning any
person, or any member of his family,
whether living or dead, by which the
reputation of that person is likely to
be injured, or by which he is likely
to be injured in his profession or
trade, or by which other persons are
likely to be induced to shun or avoid
or ridicule or despise him, is called
defamatory, and the matter of the
imputation is called defamatory
matter.
“The imputation may be expressed
either directly or by insinuation or
irony.”

first arose in Queensland, whence it was
adopted in Tasmania and Western Aus-
tralia. It contains no reference to the
writer’s intention to harm the family,
and in this it departs from the Indian
Penal Code. It does not appear to have
been adopted anywhere else in the
civilised world.
The Indian Code was written by Lord
Macaulay as a result of his experience
in the 1830 s. It was based on the law
of England, but it makes no mention of
the dead. The Indian definition of de-
famation is as follows:
“Whosoever by words either spoken,
or intended to be read, or by signs,
or by visible representations, makes
or publishes any imputation concern-
ing any person, intending to harm or
knowing or having any reason to
believe that such imputation will harm
the reputation of such person ... is
said to defame that person.”
The dead come into the explanations
of the Code in Starling and Constable’s
“Indian Criminal Law”. Explanation 1
says:
“It may amount to imputation to
impute to a deceased person, if the
imputation would harm the reputation
of that person if living, and is intended
to be hurtful to the feelings of the
family or other near relatives.”
The intention makes all the difference.
In the definition devised by Griffith
there is no question of intention, no con-
sideration of malice towards a living
person.
The saving paragraph in the New
South Wales Act is vague and uncertain:
“A publication is said to be made
in good faith for the information of
the public if the person by whom it is
made is not actuated in making it by
ill-will to the person defamed, or by
any other improper motive . .
The “person defamed” being a dead
person, this paragraph is of no help to
the historian and the biographer.
Beyond the law?
JAid Samuel Griffith go beyond the
Common Law in drawing up the
Queensland Code?
Griffith devised his definition of de-
famatory matter about 1880, very soon
after the House of Commons had re-
jected a code which included defamation.
Let us agree that Griffith was a good
lawyer and a painstaking judge: whether
he was a great lawyer or a great judge
is another matter, since many of his
judgments in the High Court have since
been reversed. As a bottle-a-day man
he had no small belief in his capabilities,
and he had unbounded confidence in
himself.
He began drawing up the Queensland
Criminal Code in 1893, while Chief
Justice. He finished the job in 1899.
His definition of defamatory matter
he carried over from his Queensland
Defamation Act of 1889 to form section
366 of the Queensland Criminal Code
(Chapter 35).
No one suspects the validity of
Griffith’s definition merely because he
made it in 1880. It is not the age of
the definition that matters, but the age
that produced it.
Despite all that has been said in
praise of Griffith, he was a man of his
times, and his times introduced into his
thinking and took him beyond the
Indian Code in framing his definition.
Did that intrusion make his definition
of defamation defective?
Defamation is a personal matter,
between the defamer and the defamed.
Any sound codification of the law that
met that consideration would pass. Were
Griffith’s codification of 1889-99 to
adhere to that principle, it would be
unassailable. But if any extraneous
factors came into his codification, it
would be suspect.
Were there any extraneous factors in
his thinking? From Griffith’s speech in
the second reading of his Defamation
Bill of 1889, it would seem so.
“I think,” he said, “a man might be
injured quite as much by an imputation
cast upon his father and mother as
upon himself. But at the present time
he has no redress. Suppose, for instance,
it was said that a man bearing a high
and eminent character was a child of
incest. That is no imputation concern-
ing him, but it would be a shameful
imputation upon his father and mother.”
Having started this hare, Griffith
pursued it “beyond the seas”.
“This is one illustration, and there are
many others that will occur to the minds
of honorable members, especially in
regard to people in Australia, where
people may be injured by imputations
upon deceased persons or persons on
the other side of the world.”
Any schoolboy today could guess
what Griffith was hinting at.
The imperial convict system had
ceased in Western Australia only 20
years previously, in Tasmania only 30-
odd years before. As for Queensland
itself the convicts in the Hashemy, only
40 years before, had been rejected at
Sydney and sent on to Moreton Bay.
Is it a coincidence that it was these
three States only which in the beginning
adopted Griffith’s codification? That is,
until 1958.
Hypersensitivity
/Griffith’s words fell on the ears of
men who numbered among themselves
the sons of imperial convicts. They
were hypersensitive to the fact that their
fathers had been the assigned servants
of the squatters who had in the preceding
decades dictated Queensland legislation.
Now they and their fellows in pro-
fessions and trades in the young Colony
were emerging by hundreds from the
shadow of that peculiar social stigma,
and Griffith wanted to make sure that
it would not fall across their lives again.
Hence his anxiety to protect them in the
pursuit of their livelihood, to shield them
from the likelihood of being shunned or
avoided or ridiculed or despised.
So he emphasised the defamation of
the dead, and to do so he went further
than the Code drawn up by the English
Select Committee in 1879, which was
rejected by the House of Commons,
further even than the Indian Penal Code
or its explanations in Starling and
Constable.
It would seem that Mr W. B. Camp-
bell, of the Queensland bar, who was
quoted by Mr Asher Joel in the New
South Wales Legislative Council on
December 2, 1958, was correct in saying
that this part of the Queensland Criminal
Code was “a product of our early con-
vict days”. It was enacted, in other
words, for the purpose of preventing
people from saying, “Your father was
a lag.”
There would seem to be a strong case,
on historical grounds, for reform, not
only of the New South Wales Defama-
tion Act of 1958, but of this Chapter of
the Queensland Criminal Code.
It is interesting to note that both
Tasmania and Western Australia took
steps to reform the code before New
South Wales, if Mr Downing is correct,
adopted it in its pristine colonial purity.
The Queensland and New South Wales
Statutes are neither wholly bad nor
wholly good; but they do appear to
stand in need of reform.
That such reform is desirable appears
from the views of the British Select
Committee which in 1939 began examin-
ing the defamation law of England.
Its chairman, Lord Porter, presented
its report in 1948. The Committee re-
ported against codifying the defamation
law. In specific references to the
chapters of the Indian Code covering


defamation, the Committee used such
phrases as “of very little real assistance”;
“couched in very general language”
necessarily so, the Committee thought.
Of the Indian definition and Starling and
Constable’s explanations, the 1948
English Committee said:
“Even the definition of defamation
[is] of little assistance in simplifying the
law or making its principles more exact
or definite, nor do the four explanations
or ten exceptions set out . . . obviate
these difficulties.”
Sir Samuel Griffith was hindered by
no such fine considerations.
Nor is Mr Downing, who now speaks
of such a code as “one to which
reference can simply and effectively be
made”.
My word!
Simply and effectively!
Scrap-books mutilated
Tn his Press letter Dr Roderick, “in the
course of work on a biography of
Henry Lawson”, drew attention to
excision of material from four Lawson
scrap-books in the Mitchell Library.
Any reader who goes to look at
scrap-book A 1877, correspondence from
Henry Lawson between 1916 and 1918,
will see that pages 429 - 440 have been
cut out. On page 428 is the note: “Pages
429-440, not to be available for public
use for 25 years from Mar., 1959, have
been extracted and placed in small safe.”
Roderick also listed scrap - books
AIB9O, A 1892 and AIB9B as being
mutilated.
To save the reader the trouble of
examining these, it may as well be said
that AIB9O has had ten pages cut out,
A 1892 four pages, and AIB9B three
pages.
The Defamation Bill became law on
31st December, 1958.
The Principal Librarian is convinced
that excision of this material was not
connected with the enactment of the
Defamation Bill. They just coincided.
These scrap-books were sold to the
Library in 1933 by Henry Lawson’s
publisher, George Robertson.
According to Dr Roderick, writings
filed in the Library state that a number
of these scrap-books and a number of
boxes of correspondence were purchased
at that time. There were several letters
by living persons in the boxes of corres-
pondence. These letters, it is believed,
Robertson directed should be sealed
during the lifetime of the writers. As
to the bound scrap-books, the Librarian
at the time took care to put it on record
that this direction was not to apply to
anything in them. They were to remain
intact for the free prosecution of re-
search by genuine historians and
biographers.
They were available from 1933 to
December, 1958. During much of this
time Dr H. V. Evatt, an eminent lawyer,
was President of the Library Board and
its Standing Committee. No action to
hinder access to the material on these
pages appeared necessary. In fact, the
material, it is understood, was copied
several times by students interested in
Henry Lawson’s life and writings.
A few days after the passing of the
Defamation Bill, the Library Board
appointed a committee which went
through the boxes of papers (among
them Box 7 of a set numbered 184)
and a number of scrap-books set aside.
The Library Board, under the Presi-
dency of Dr Evatt, appears to have felt
itself obliged in 1959 to withdraw from
circulation material from the scrap-
books numbered A 1877, AlB9O and
A 1892, which had been available for
25 years.
It is not known what papers had to
be taken from the boxes, but they are
believed to include material proving
that Lawson spent some time in gaol.
An apologist for the Act has pointed
out that part of the definition of “de-
famatory matter” requires the reputation
of the present-day plaintiff to be affected
by the imputation concerning the mem-
ber of his family defamed.
In this case, it would seem, Australia’s
leading writer, a public figure, author of
some outstanding prison poems and
sketches, wrote letters from gaol which
may well be as much a matter for public
scrutiny as the poems themselves. If
he has cast an imputation upon him-
self, or upon any other deceased person,
should they be withheld from the public?
No one will love Lawson the less for
what is in them. If they do, what of it?
“The dead,” wrote Sir James Stephen,
“have no rights and can suffer no
wrongs. The living alone can be the
subject of legal protection, and the law
of libel is intended to protect them, not
against every writing which gives them
pain, but against writings holding them
up individually to hatred, contempt, or
ridicule.”
This is, or for us in New South Wales
was, the spirit of the law.
So long as the Defamation Act con-
tinues to force an indignity of this
nature on the work of a writer of the
stature and character of Henry Lawson,
so long will it excite opposition to its
existence.
Clearly the early plea of the Historical
Society should be heeded, and in the
interest of all the Act should be re-
mitted to a Select Committee for search-
ing examination.
The Defamation Bill - 2
" Your old man was a poxy lag"
By M. H. ELLIS
Gix years after the New South Wales
Defamation Act of 1958 became law,
Mr Askin, Leader of the Opposition in
the Legislative Assembly, has renewed
his promise that he will repeal it when
his party gets back into office. He says
that it “involves a blatant restriction of
free speech” and he condemns it anew,
especially on the grounds that “historians
and biographers” find it impossible to
present an accurate picture of the times.”
They are, he declares, “being inhibited
by the fear of being sued by descendants
of controversial figures”, and he adds,
“Much of the history we read today is
of doubtful authenticity because writers
are afraid for various reasons to write
the truth. It is a deplorable thing that the
Government of New South Wales has
placed restrictions on historians writing
the truth.”
Neither I nor my publishers have seen
anything in the Act which has caused
us to dump anything that I have written
or to change my policy of exposing
old-time fraud and corruption as of yore,
for the future. Neither have I noticed the
complainants against Section 5 of the
Act muzzling themselves despite their
outcry.
I do not like the Defamation Act of
1958, but rather for what it does not
say than what it does say. It seems to
leave so much open for judicial inter-
pretation that I wonder the Bar Associa-
tion has not given Mr Downing a com-
plimentary dinner and held a thanks-
giving service. I believe, out of fifty years’
experience in polemical journalism, that
a uniform defamation law for the whole
Commonwealth is needed —a simple Act
framed by an expert committee similar
to the English Committee headed by Lord
Porter in 1948. And all that Act need do
is to amend the Common Law to clear
ambiguities and iron out and rationalise
the standard defences, remove inequities
concerning such matters as unintentional
libel, bring the law relating to broadcast-
ing and TV up to date and provide some
protection to writers and publishers
against the malicious prosecutor who acts

all the year round
through a stooge man-of-straw. Western
Australia has protection of this kind in
a clause which allows a defendant to go
before a judge in chambers and make
ou t a case before hearing for security
for costs from the plaintiff.
However, if the committee were to
write in the definition section about
which there has been so much outcry in
New South Wales I would not object. It
has been in the Queensland law since
1889, in West Australian law since 1901,
in the Tasmanian law since 1957 and in
the NSW law since 1958 without causing
anybody one pennyworth of incon-
venience. All the Porter Commission
could say about it, when it considered it
as an aspect of codification of torts, was
that it did nothing to make the law
clearer and the committee certainly did
not believe for one minute that it meant
what its critics have said in NSW, viz.,
that it makes it impossible for historians
to write the truth, or teachers to teach
the truth, about the dead, without run-
ning into grave peril.
The section reads:
5. Any imputation concerning any
person, or any member of his family,
whether living or dead, by which the
reputation of that person is likely to
be injured, or by which he is likely
to be injured in his profession or
trade, or by which other persons
are likely to be induced to shun or
avoid or ridicule him, is called de-
famatory, and the matter is called
defamatory matter.
And it is provided that whether the
words used are capable of a defamatory
meaning is a matter of law—for the
judge to decide; and that whether or no
they are defamatory is a matter of fact
•—to be settled by a jury.
“Leg-irons on research”
HPhe Royal Australian Historical Society
declared in 1958 when the Bill
was going through in NSW that this
section would “put leg-irons on historical
research” and that it feared “that pub-
lishers, printers and booksellers, in their
anxiety to avoid risk of action, will
refuse to handle the results of historical
research”.
None of them have shown any signs
of doing this. Messrs Angus & Robert-
son only a little while ago, when I con-
sulted them about the new editions of
three of my books now in preparation,
expressed themselves satisfied that the
section made little difference. Dr Geof-
frey Sawer, Professor of Law in the
Australian National University, declared
that he did not believe that the law had
been materially changed and that, as
before, the risk lay not in defaming the
dead (who cannot suffer material damage)
but by saying something about the dead
that injured the living. The best kind of
illustration of this sort of damage was
given by Sir Samuel Griffith when he
opened the second reading debate on
the Queensland Defamation Bill in 1889.
He cited as an example a case in which
it might be said of a living person that
his or her parents had formed an inces-
tuous union. And many years later I
heard him explain to (Sir) Edward
Macartney in conversation that the sec-
tion—which he had taken from Sir Ed-
ward Pollock’s draft Code Torts for India
(never enacted), after it had been adopted
by Pollock from the Indian Penal Code
of 1860 —had been introduced to Queens-
land law in the hope that it would curb
the scurrility of abuse endemic in the
period of the great industrial upheaval
of the maritime and shearers’ strikes,
and give warning that citizens could
without doubt defend themselves against
such delicate repartee as, “Your old man
was a poxy lag.” He said that he knew
of one such case which apparently had
had tragic results.
Griffith himself admitted in his second
reading speech that the clause involved
an alteration of the Common Law and
the doughty enemies of Section 5, who
took up their daggers in 1958, took the
same stand and represented it as some-
thing merely of a special period. Dr Colin
Roderick, one of the members of the
RAHS who has been most vocal in
condemning this section, in pointing out
its alleged dangers described at as “out-
moded ... a desiccated corpse” which
forced Queensland historians to have
their books published outside Queensland.
He added, “Personally I found it neces-
sary to leave Queensland 12 years ago to
practise my profession.”
It could have done Dr Roderick no
good to leave Queensland so long as his
books were on sale there; and sending
their books to be published in the south
would have been no protection to
Queensland authors, since the very act
of sending the manuscripts to a publisher
would be publication —indeed the very
handing of a manuscript to a clerk to be
copied, if the clerk copies it, has been
held to be publication. But apart from
that, so far from being outmoded the
section, as the years have gone by, has
come closer and closer to modern Com-
mon Law which has been evolving
through a flood of judicial interpretations
and findings until it seems clear that
however you injure a person by writing
or statuary, caricature or hanging a lamp
in front of his house to imply that he
is a keeper of a house of ill-fame, the
injured person has his remedy. You can
libel him through suggesting that his
mother had syphilis which is inheritable,
through reflecting on his partner, through
praising him if it harms him, and in jest
or in earnest. You can even libel him
and find yourself paying large damages
though you have never heard of him.
You can defame an entirely imaginary
fictional character of the same name. In
the famous Artemis Jones case, a journa-
list wrote an imaginary account of a visit
to France by a fictional character named
Artemis Jones who indulged in many gay
adventures. And a real Artemis Jones, a
sobersided barrister turned up and,
though he had never been in France,
collected substantial damages, it having
appeared that the articles had disparaged
him in the minds of right-thinking men.
One feature that adds more than normal
picturesqueness to the exhibition of fear
to which the learned doctors have treated
us, lies in the fact that the original author
of the section, a member of the Supreme
Council of India, was an author and
historian even more eminent than those
passing judgment on his legal work at
present.
The “Black Act”
TTe was, in fact, Thomas Babbington
Macaulay, who was no doubt (if the
modern critics of his work are right)
aware that he was debarring himself for
ever from circulating in India his works
written and then unwritten, which do not
spare such personalities as Marlborough,
Elijah Impey, the great Coke and the
author of a memoir of Sir James Mackin-
tosh (well known in India) who showed
a desire to shoot him at dawn for his
criticisms. And incidentally those same
modern critics who jeered when they
heard that the section came out of the
Indian Penal Code that it had been fram-
ed to help the brutal British suppress the
poor Indian, showed themselves as weak
on history itself as they were on the de-
famation law. At the period at which
Macaulay drafted the Code —and being
subjected to as scurrilous a campaign of
abuse as ever man has suffered, at the
hands of the Europeans in India —he was
criticised for his part in passing the
“Black Act” which transferred the hear-
ing of appeals from the white-manned
Supreme Court to the Sardar Court. And
he was also then engaged in the campaign
which produced the abolition of licensing
of Indian newspapers and freedom of
expression for the Indian Press. I com-
mend his minutes on that subject as
bedside reading to the pundits of the
Royal Australian Historical Society.

An editorial conference at work on Australia s first truly national daily newspaper Tlilian.
WHY THESE MEN
NEW
NEWSPAPER
For responsible who really want to know what’s happening in the world
Australia’s first truly national newspaper The Australian (now
on sale in all capital cities) has been founded by the News
Limited Group and planned by some of Australia’s most
responsible journalists because in this time of perplexity and
uncertainty there is a need for a newspaper devoted to the
highest standards of accuracy and comment. Australia is
ready for such a newspaper.
Modern communication techniques now make it possible to
produce a new kind of daily newspaper, of truly national
outlook, reporting on the nation to the nation, produced in
Canberra and printed simultaneously in Sydney, Canberra
and Melbourne. In The Australian you find:
OVERSEAS NEWS. More overseas news than in any other
daily newspaper, selected from the 50,000 words that flof
The Australian office every night from famous internal
news services, from the foreign services of great British
American newspapers and from The Australian’s own
and correspondents. j
NATIONAL NEWS. Highly expert reporting on trend
Australian politics, government departments, unions an®
economy, provided by experts reporting from all over 1
tralia. Nine specialist writers will report on what is happ<
in the Federal Government departments alone. j
COMMENT. Two leader pages every day provide backfpj
analysis and interpretation of events in Australia and j
seas. These two leader pages will be written with detacM
ffld honesty and in the spirit of independence.
GENERAL NEWS. Human disasters and triumphs and the
lighter side of our national life are presented in The
Australian not only with liveliness but with a sense of
responsibility.
BUSINESS. The Australian provides full lists from the
■Melbourne and Sydney stock exchanges, with trading reports
worn other centres. There is essential interpretative analysis
jier investors and necessary background information for all
business men.
LEISURE. Motoring, outdoor life, holidays and travel,
hardening. All of these will be reported every week in The
Australian. And The Australian’s sports reports will, for the
first time, look at Australia’s sport from an overall national
viewpoint.
BOOKS AND THE ARTS. Each Saturday specialist reviews
of the books intelligent people are talking about. And weekly
columns and reports on music, painting, architecture, drama,
folk music, films, television.
WOMEN. The Australian assumes that women want intelligent
reporting on fashion, cookery, diets, beauty care, even social
events. Miss Myra Roper will conduct an invaluable Education
Question Box. Other specialists will look for women’s interest
in the daily news and report it in The Australian.

Commonwealth Rhetoric?
A gimmick of the 1940s
By DONALD HORNE
Commonwealth” as a con-
cept was one of the gimmicks
of that dreadful decade, the
nineteen-forties. The word had been
used before then, but until the nineteen-
forties “the Empire” was still the favor-
ite term. In the nineteen-forties, when
the Japanese showed how hollow imperial
power was in South-East Asia by knock-
ing it over, “the Commonwealth” be-
came a word that progressives used to
welcome change, and conservatives to
conceal their resistance to change.
Reactionaries kept on defiantly using
“Empire” until everyone stopped listen-
ing to them.
The Commonwealth is no longer a
concept based on reality and power, but
on wishes, propaganda or intellectual
middle games. It has been useful to the
British, first as a device for cloaking
power and then as a device for cloaking
the loss of power; to Africans as a
propaganda apparatus; to statesmen,
scholars and commentators as a talking
point; it can be given whatever “use” the
occasion demands. To some its main
“use” is merely that it should continue,
that the name should still be used.
At last week’s Prime Ministers’ Con-
ference in London the British seemed to
be playing for some pre-election display;
the Africans were trying to increase
pressure on South Africa and Southern
Rhodesia; Britain, Malaysia and Aus-
tralia were trying to drum up support
for Malaysia. These are all legitimate
political activities. The point is that the
meeting was simply seized by these exist-
ing forces and turned to their purposes
as any other meeting anywhere in the
world would be.
Around these power manoeuvres the
drama is built up: Will the Common-
wealth survive? What this means is:
Will anyone walk out this time? When
no one did walk out the dramatists of
the Commonwealth proclaim: The
Commonwealth will survive (or the
Commonwealth is stronger than ever or
something).
Yet, except for the decision to explore
the possibility of setting up a secretariat
to aid under-privileged Commonwealth
countries, nothing happened at this con-
ference that defined the Commonwealth.
It is remotely possible that this sec-
retariat may work. In that case the
Commonwealth will be defined. It will
become an aid outfit. This is a good idea,
although (as I shall suggest later) it
is doubtful if it would make the best
channel for Australia’s aid programme.
Given these facts it is almost un-
imaginable that Australians should still
give “the Commonwealth” anything
much more than ritualistic significance.
Yet it is evidence of the conventional
nature of wisdom that in 1964 there still
are some Australians tinkering around
with suggestions about giving the Com-
monwealth some kind of “cohesion” and
“common purpose”.
Lord Casey is their principal spokes-
man, and it is perhaps significant that
on this topic he writes more like an
Englishman than like an Australian. For
instance, he recently wrote: “Our obliga-
tions are first to the developing Com-
monwealth countries. They have the
right to look largely to us for this sort
of assistance, against the background of
many generations of loyal dependence
to us.”
Does one have to point out that no
Commonwealth country, whether under-
developed or over-developed, has been
loyally dependent on Australia, and that
if this were to be the test of obligation
we would have obligations to none of
them and they would have no right to
look to us for anything?
It is unimaginable that the younger
generations of Australians could make
such an error in identity as Lord Casey’s.
In fact, although the schools still put
out some Commonwealth propaganda,
it is very hard not to believe that it is
only to Lord Casey’s generation and to
some parts of the generation after it
that there still accrue some of the
emotions of the old days.
One should not forget that until
Curtin’s “Look to America” statement
in 1942 British imperialism was still the
dominant ideology of most of the Aus-
tralian elites and that this is what a lot
of the rhetoric of politics was about.
It is not possible to understand Sir
Robert Menzies’ earlier career, for in-
stance, without understanding this. For
most of his career, “loyalty”, to Menzies,
meant loyalty to the British Empire.
When the Empire folded, he spent some
of his ingenuity imagining ways of turn-
ing the Commonwealth into an admini-
strative unit. Now he is content with
being a Queen’s man. That is all that
is left to him of the old story.
As a symbol of multi-racialism the
Commonwealth has not taken on as well
here as in Britain. Most Australians
who are concerned about racial prejudice
realistically concentrate on Australia’s
relations with Asia, which concern them
more directly. In the Labor Party, how-
ever, the Commonwealth still has some
significance as an off-the-hook device.
Labor men cannot speak too directly
about Asia because their party is the
one significant institution in Australia
still committed to a “White Australia
Policy” in those very words. And along
with the United Nations, the Common-
wealth is a handy kind of thing to talk
about to hide Labor’s lack of any real
alternative to Australia’s present foreign
policy.
But apart from conservatives like Mr
Calwell and Lord Casey, Australians are
becoming increasingly aware that there
is practically nothing in the Common-
wealth for us.
It certainly means nothing in terms of
trade or strategic involvement. The
possibility of continued British involve-
ment in South-East Asia has given new
interest to the British connection. But
other non-Asian Commonwealth coun-
tries are of strategic interest to Aus-
tralia mainly because—along with the
rest of the world they have votes at
United Nations meetings.
The Commonwealth is a useful con-
nection for fiddling sympathetic UN
votes or other diplomatic support. Per-
haps this is all that there is left in it
for Australia: we should use it as part
of our international horse-trading in
pursuit of happiness for our policies.
But we have to keep in mind that on
the kind of issues that particularly
interest us relations with China, the
future of Malaysia or of New Guinea
Commonwealth countries are as likely
to oppose as to support us. The Com-
monwealth is increasingly becoming an
African pressure group that is not likely
to be interested in Asian issues a fact
that is significant not only to us but to
other Commonwealth members living in
this part of the world.
So far as the Asian Commonwealth
countries go, their importance to us
depends not on their membership of the
Commonwealth but on their attitudes to
China and Indonesia, the two revisionist
powers who threaten the present set-up
in Asia. India became a more important
country to Australia when the Chinese
invaded it, and Pakistan became less
important when it began to deal with
the Chinese. Malaysia is at present of


immense importance to Australia. But
how important is Ceylon?
Australians have not been bereft of
the recognition of a broad, co-operative
self-interest that may involve sacrifices,
aS well as of self-interest in the more
narrow sense.
They paid their price of admission
to the now defunct Empire in two world
wa rs with volunteer armies (and left
themselves almost defenceless against
Japanese attack in the second one); they
put up a technically flawless perform-
ance in the cold war against Russia
(which is to say that they voted the right
way and made the right statements);
they entered into all the right commit-
ments in the policy of containment of
China, and put up men in Korea; and
in aiding the developing nations of Asia,
they have at least paid out some money
and there is a growing feeling that they
should pay out more.
But it is doubtful if there is any sense
in Australia entering into any wider
Commonwealth commitments unless
it were for purely propaganda reasons
and Australia certainly has no obligation
to do so. Perhaps such commitments as
we can make should be concentrated
among our Asian neighbors. Let the
West Europeans worry about Africa.
It is the British connection that keeps
Australia in the Commonwealth. It was
the fact that the British had an Empire
that interested Australians in the Empire
and their identification then was with
the British, who did the ruling, rather
than with the colonial people who were
ruled. As the significance of Britain for
Australia declines, the significances of
the Commonwealth for Australia decline.
It is our relation with Britain that we
should be talking about rather than with
the Commonwealth, and here one detects
a new climate of opinion, perhaps not
unconnected with the replacement of
British strategic strength by American
and the rivalling of British trading
strength by the Japanese.
Older people just do not realise how
differently Australians who came of age
after the Pacific War regard Britain.
And one should not forget that Aus-
tralia is not a “British” country, except
in the very general sense. Less than two
thirds of the progenitors of the present
Australians were British. The rest were
Irish, Italian, German, Dutch, Polish,
Greek and so forth. And Australian
society is quite a different “mix” from
British society.
One would seem safe in forecasting a
new Australian nationalism different
from the nationalism of the 1890 s, more
poised in defining and accepting national
styles, but determined ultimately on con-
stitutional change as a final declaration
of independence. In Australia the future
of the Commonwealth should be con-
sidered in this context.

ART
A Genius of Portraiture
Compassion , irony and satire in the Dobell show
By JOHN HENSHAW
Dobell Retrospective Exhibition. Art
Gallery of NSW. Sydney.
A major event like this Dobell retro-
spective is not repeatable; its
uniqueness lies in its coming at the
climax of a long, sometimes stormy
career. Dobell’s is the most familiar
name in Australian art, ironically asso-
ciated first with our most talked about
art rumpus, only later surrounded with
the adulation we now accept as his due.
Well over 200 paintings illustrate his
development since the Ashton days of
1926. Friends and connoisseurs alike
will be astonished at the number, in view
of his apparent slowness of working.
Seen together they constitute a formid-
able show, divided into two: portraits
in one, genre and landscapes in the
other of the lower gallery courts. A
colossal amount of organisation has been
well spent in bringing pictures from as
far afield as Britain, France the USA
and Malaya.
Hal Missingham, the trustees of the
gallery and staff deserve the warmest
support for their efforts. Gaps are rela-
tively few, the most important absence
being “Billy Boy”, one of the greatest,
and a number of wartime sketches and
paintings from Canberra. A further
exhibition would be needed to cover
the drawings, but it is a pity some could
not be seen alongside the finished things.
This rich capacity for realising form is
one of Dobell’s finest gifts, without it
the artistic climaxes of the 'thirties and
’forties would be unthinkable.
Dobell's intense interest in the human
condition has produced images of com-
passion, irony and satire, grotesquerie,
charm, sinister and elusive mystery,
sensuality and innocence. He binds all
into a magic of vitality, actual and
painterly.
In the life of London and Sydney’s
King’s Cross he found the world which
dealt in his own currency. He was able
to seize those aspects out of the flux
of time, which fascinated him and in
doing so rendering them visible to suc-
ceeding generations.
The assurance which the valuable
training of Julian Ashton and Henry
Gibbons had given him soon flowered
under the influence of the old masters
in London. If “Portrait of an Elderly
Woman”, 1930, recalls a Goya head of
about 1790, “Head of a Sculptress”,
1931, predicts the tactile qualities of the
renowned, “Mrs South Kensington” of six
years later. This ability to manipulate,
the ripple, flow and density of sheer
paint, makes it sprout into a lively image
full of vivacious satire, sympathy and
charm, lifts Dobell's painting above
illustration. Something of a modeller's
rather than a carver's skill obtains here.
IVfosT of Dobell’s forms could be built
up out of clay and his concept of
form is full, realistic; it seeks ample
volumes. If in the process of enlargement
some of these appear over-full by com-
parison it has a lot to do with a pre-
ference for the small-scaled, the cabinet-
sized format. In this realm Dobell is in
complete control. His sketches for im-
portant portraits like “Dame Mary Gil-
more”, “Sir Hudson Fysh”, “Sir Charles
Lloyd Jones” reveal exquisite insight into
character, beautiful qualities of silvery
color, texture and light which don’t quite
arrive in the bigger versions. Colors
change, forms are less exciting and more
predictable, the personal idiosyncrasies
not so evident. On the other hand none
of the “Cypriot” sketches match the
monumental, Bronzino-like poise of the
final painting, nor its glowing intensities
of color and brilliance of drawing.
Sheer physical presence carries the
weight of deeper insights in Dobell’s
finest portraits “The Strapper”, “Billy
Boy”, “Brian Penton”, “Joshua Smith”
(ironically destroyed by fire, itself the
centre of our greatest conflagration in the
art world, and represented in the retro-
spective by a sketch), “The Sleeping
Greek”, as well as the above three.
Changing fashions cannot diminish this
achievement, lighting up as it were in
the ’forties from the restricted tones of
the early ’thirties painting.
Deep sensitivities enabled Dobell to
stand apart from the maelstrom of con-


temporary art, within the broad humanist
tradition stemming from the Renaissance,
through Rembrandt, Hogarth, Goya,
Daumier, Renoir and the expressionists
of the early 1900 s. This spirit
is romantic, exalting the particular.
Genre subjects; costers, bathers, children,
the enormously popular “Dead Land-
lord,” “Street Singer”, the elusive New
Guinea paintings, odd landscapes, ani-
mal pieces, challenge the supremacy of
the portraits for richness of portrayal and
humanity.
Twice Dobell's continuity of working
was tragically interrupted, in 1944 as
a result of the court case, in 1954 when
he gave up further concern with his
New Guinea paintings as a result of
a hostile art review. The first was by
far the most disastrous, but both pos-
sibly robbed him of valuable creative
time. This double-sided sensitivity, both
outgoing and retiring, has enabled him
to produce paintings of unchallenged
mastery, within the context of 20th cen-
tury art, yet asserting their own terms
of evaluation. This superb exhibition
coinciding with the release of the new
monograph by James Gleeson, on
Dobell’s art, will further enhance his
reputation here and overseas. As this
has long been established, we can take
heart that recognition by people who
took art seriously has never been far
from him.
TELEVISION
Cool Egotist
The Danny Kaye Show. Channel 2,
Sydney.
T once had the good fortune to attend
a “Secretary-General’s Evening” at
the UN where the evening's principal
guest, and principal performer, was
Dannny Kaye. On the stately podium of
that ghastly, over-decorated General
Assembly room—the best use to which it
was ever put—Danny Kaye joked, sang,
nimbly danced and then sat down in
freakish silence to smoke a cigarette with
a tremulous reference to the nearby,
legendary Dag Hammarskjold as “that
Mr Schuuuldhammar”. It was New York
Jewish humor; lively, responsive, spon-
taneous, it worked like a charm with an
enormous, wildly mixed audience. After
years of indifferent films and annual
appearances at The Palace and The
Palladium, Danny Kaye is right back
to that sort of form in his “Danny
Kaye Show”—the best hour’s entertain-
ment weekly I have ever seen on TV.
The TV format suits him. It is immediate
and personal. He can work with gifted
scripters and expert directors. He can
exercise his two great talents of unremit-
ting self-confidence and control of those
working with him, especially those who
are amateurs, or shy or nervous. His
handling of the Clinger sisters, for
example, or the little Japanese ballerina,
or his three frightened secretaries is un-
faltering. He is over-fond of mime and
his ear is not as infallible as he likes to
think. After watching four skits, four
consecutive Saturday nights, in which he
played Englishmen of one sort or
another, I felt it was a pity that some-
one hadn’t punctured his placid assump-
tion that he never makes a mistake in
miming accents. He does and he is not
in the race with Peter Sellers or Joyce
Grenfell. Where he never makes a
mistake is in miming gestures or in con-
veying age or youth or middle-aged
haplessness by a quaver of the voice,
or wearing spectacles or donning a
woman's dress. Or in his capacity to
make just about anything go, includ-
ing helpless, hilarious drunknessess, as in
the skit he played with Glynis Johns
where he stood, literally paralytic, unable
to take a step. But this is not all Danny
Kaye, even though most of it is.
His Noel Talent, Madame Schmacken-
wasser and top-hatted singing star of
“The Apple Blossoms of 1932”, to take
three examples, are equally the creations
of one of the most gifted teams of script
writers going. “Such and Such cigarettes
are best because we say so.” is, after all,
a good line in almost anybody’s mouth.
So was the Spray On Lunch and the
Bouncing Soap routine. But having said
all that, there remains Kaye, the per-
former and cool egotist, confident
enough to appear weekly with some of
the best performers in the business with-
out even a sign of wanting to steal their
lines. He doesn’t have to.

Camuel Bronston’s new spectacular
is one of those long films that equates
stodginess with serious purpose, with
none of the narrative drive of “Fifty-
Five Days At Peking” or the panache
of “El Cid”. It’s generally pleasing to
the eye, but I'd advise earplugs.
I don’t suppose the film is historically
accurate, though I’m no judge even
when I felt duty bound to read all the
classics I was defeated by Gibbon. As
the film begins, the fatally ill Marcus
Aurelius is conducting a campaig n
against the barbarians. He is assassin-
ated (unnecessarily, considering his state
of health) and the succession passes to
his unworthy son instead of the bone-
headed soldier favored by Marcus
Aurelius.
The new Caesar, despite the dis-
approval of his sister and her suitor
the dumb military man, plays merry
hell with Rome's internal economy,
antagonises her allies and finally be-
comes completely bonkers and deifies
himself. Christopher Plummer’s per-
formance as the mad emperor is one of
the saving compensations of the film,
a three - dimensioned characterisation,
witty and alive.
Otherwise the acting is worthily dull,
with Alec Guinness giving one of his
most stately and irritating performances
as Marcus Aurelius, and Sophia Loren
and Stephen Boyd being handsome and
boring. Robert Krasker's subtle color
photography is always a pleasure.
No blocks will be busted by “The
Charge Is Murder”, which briefly visited
Sydney; a harmless, routine courtroom
drama that looks like an elongated tele-
vision show —the painstakingly realistic
sets are two-dimensional, the star is
Richard Chamberlain and the director,
Boris Sagal, is from the tiny screen, too.
Chamberlain's performance is easy,
pleasant and forgettable; Sagal, still un-
used to the feature-length film, hurries
over the high spots and wastes time on
the less important background bits.
The double bill of Rene Clair films
(an early sound film and his most recent
work) has interest for students of the
cinema. Though Clair is one of the most
durable of directors, his true inspira-
tion comes from the silent-film tech-
nique. “The Italian Straw Hat” remains
a masterpiece to this day, and even in
his sound films his best moments are in
mime and sight comedy—his treatment
of dialogue is often gauche.
This is so generally in “Tout l'Or du
Monde”, though are flashes of
satiric wit in the spoof of a television
show. But Clair’s comments on the
modern world are superficial and often
naif, and it is in the sight gags that he
shows traces of his old form.
Indeed in this supposedly sophisticated
comedy, the funniest sequence shows an
irascible peasant peppering his enemies’
backsides with a shotgun loaded with
coarse salt.
Bourvil, playing a dual role as the
bucolic father and son whose dunder-
headed obstinacy bests the smart city
slickers, stands out in an expert, beauti-
fully chosen cast.
As for “Le Million”, it’s awful. It’s
accepted as a cinema classic, so I’m glad
to have seen it; but any maker of home
movies would be ashamed of it.

HOW TO AVOID MISTRAKES & ERRERS
Well, the obvious way is to use a calculator.
But isn’t it true that you can make mistakes as you feed
information into a calculator?
Not with a Facit. It’s almost impossible to make a mistake
because you see each number displayed immediately, as you
enter it. And both the first number and the multiplying
number are permanently on display for checking during the
calculation.
This virtually mistake-proof characteristic is the main reason
Facit Calculators are used in all Australian banks and
universities.
You can learn to operate a Facit in 14 minutes. You can
have a free trial for 14 days. And in 1966, the Facit Calculator
will also become an excellent adding machine—without
decimal conversion.
There are six high-speed models to choose from, and a
demonstration is always available at the sole Australian agents:

T udwig Senfl, acknowledged as one
of the leading half-dozen composers
of the second quarter of the 16th
century, but to me more or less a name
in the history book until now, comes
suddenly to life as a masterly and many-
sided artist in this latest disc from the
enterprising New York Pro Musica
ensemble.
Senfl appears here in liturgical, non-
liturgical and heartily secular moods:
on one side a splendid Easter Mass; on
the other, seven polyphonic songs of
astonishing variety, ranging from sheer
ribaldry to noble lyricism and dramatic
pathos.
The Pro Musica group, as usual,
makes a good deal of use of the instru-
ments of the period krummhorns,
organ, recorders, sackbut and so on
to reinforce the vocal lines and some-
times to substitute for them, according
to the custom of the time. If I have a
criticism, it is that in the songs the
instruments are allowed to take over
rather too much, and that the fairly
restricted choice of instrumental colors
—almost always on the sweet and gentle
side —tends to make the pieces seem less
varied than they really are.
Technically, the performances are
about the best that have come from the
Pro Musica singers and players, who,
in some of their earlier records, allowed
their admirable ambitions to outrun
their capacities in matters of intonation
and ensemble. Here the playing and
singing, under conductor Noah Green-
berg, is generally as precise as it is
spirited.
Another group dedicated to the music
of the past, the Jean-Francois Paillard
Chamber Orchestra of Paris, gives atten-
tion to another composer of rich variety,
Vivaldi, in a Record Society issue from
the French Erato catalogue.
Vivaldi’s sounding product of more
than 400 concertos most of them
written for his all-girl orchestra at the
Ospitale della Pieta in Venice—bespeaks
rather more hectic conditions of com-
position than those presumably enjoyed
by Senfl 200 years before; and even
these selected five concertos display a
certain amount of routine 18th-century
riddle-tiddle along with the authentic
Vivaldian strokes of individuality and
color. But there are enough of the latter
to make it a recording worth having.
Paillard conducts the capable players
(the solo instruments include oboe
horns, violins, flute, clarinet and bassoon)
in tense and nervous performances; the
playing sometimes seems almost too
hard-pressed, but it never drags.
The conditions in which Mozart
created often seemed to have been even
more hectic than those of Vivaldi’s days;
but the evidences of haste and routine
in his music are miraculously rare.
Where convention does take over it is
due more to the function of the music
than shortage of inspiration. In the F
major Divertimento for horns and
strings, recorded by the Vienna Octet,
we have to remember that this was
written only as incidental music to an
aristocratic birthday party; even so
Mozart finds time for a tenderly ex-
pansive adagio and an irresistibly jolly
rondo.
But the major item on this disc is,
of course, one of the richest works of
Mozart’s late years, the Clarinet Quintet.
It is played here with gracious expertise
by clarinetist Alfred Boskovsky (who
does not get a mention on the jacket
of the record) and members of the
Vienna Octet. Though the tone of
fiddles is sometimes a little steely, for
vitality, precision and stylishness, the
playing in both works is superb.
The same can be said for the Stern-
Szell interpretations of Mozart's First
and Fifth Violin Concertos on a disc that
is promised as the first of a complete
set of the concertos for violin. The
Fifth Concerto is the familiar one in A
with the “Turkish music” in the last
movement; the First, in B flat, is work
rich in melody which is worth more per-
formances than it gets.
Stern’s playing, as always, is limpid
and faultless, yet vibrantly alive.
The two opera records are single-disc
“highlight” versions of famous recent
complete recordings which need no
additional praise here. The artistic
propriety of this boiling-down process
depends largely on the nature (not neces-
sarily the quality) of the opera; with a
tightly - constructed stage - piece like
“Tosca”, for instance, highlighting is
almost totally destructive, but these two
records, I think, have plenty to offer
the listener.
In the case of a formal 18th-century
opera like “Alcina” there is little
dramatic urgency to lose and the central
feature of this performance Suther-
land’s brilliant and stylish singing is
brought into greater prominence.

the-clock race against time, seven out of
ten are International?
Isn't it significant that the sub-contractor
who simply can’t afford profit-consuming

keep, both favour International?
Significant, yes ... and quite understand-
able when you realise that International
trucks are quality all the way.
International components are continuously

it leaves the cellular suburbs,
and the clipped edges;
it passes the
huge glinting factories
that belong to no one,
and the football fields

that are dear to us all.

under new bridges and old bridges:

In the shopping centres
you can see women dragging
trollies, and kids;
cars jam the gutters.
After an hour or so

You may see a mile or two of just grass
perhaps a paragraph of cattle,
some dark trees at dusk
in the groin of a hill.
TIM BASS
Portrait of a Lady
You could be set to music;
Strings or singing wood might trace
Dancing, delicate pattern your hands inscribe
On air, but how can bearded words
Tell your five decades of grace?
Once, to the mirror’s shore
Swam golden Simonetta; Cranach
Named you Eve, Lucretia long before:
Can a single lyric celebrate
Your anthology of women?
In vain a web of rhyme
Searches the changing ebb and flow
Through unknown seas beneath your sea-green eyes;
Nor could Death, a second time
Lying with you, know you.
You raise a beckoning voice,
A third and friendly arm for friends
To flock, delight, rejoice in its welcoming bid
Beneath your roof. Who knew the dark
Well your pillow hid?
Scoured, unsoured by pain,
Enriched by loss, this autumn heart
With all its store of wine and grain for giving,
Forgiving mean and unmeaning shafts,
Is bright with spring again.
R. D. MURPHY
Prelude to Foreign Travel
The only constant
is the universal sameness of this breed
of arty typists nightly metamorphosed
into cultured tarts; of clerks whose young
ambitions fade in seedy flats;
of intellectual spivs, failed poets
selling books; of hostesses who spice
their seething brews with reputations.
One conversation in a hundred rooms,
one set of modish words, one desperate lie.
The only variables in any place
are faces, names and brands.
BEV ROBERTS
Cycle
Once it was, on the green side of a mountain,
A little below that peak where the sun had shone,
I found, unaccountably lying at my feet,
Perfectly cut, each facet glowing red,
A single precious stone.
I laid it carefully aside and swam,
Heavily, surely, into the broad stream
Whose darkening water swept me down the hillside
Mile after mile; I shall not find that stone
By daylight or by dream.
Easily said —but I have climbed once more
To the marble summit; brightness blazes wide,
Subsuming all things in a level flare
And glittering before me in the stone,
Clear above time and tide.

Before the Deluge
Europe on the brink of World War I
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Twelve Days: 24th July to 4th
August, 1914. G. M. Thomson
Hutchinson. 38s. 6d.
FThe Nord Express, one of the most
luxurious trains in Europe, jolted
slowly to a halt on the East Prussian
plain a few miles from the Russian
border. It lay amid the cornfields like
a whale stranded in a golden sea while
its passengers disembarked and ploddec
on foot beneath a blazing sun towards
the frontier. They were homeware
bound to St Petersburg from Vienna,
from Paris, from the rudely-interruptec
season at Biarritz and Monte Carlo.
Aristocratic ladies, the Princess Marie
Troubetskoy among them, tottered
through the dust in their fashionable
hobble skirts. Some of the gentlemen
carried a white banner (a bed-sheet from
one of the wagons-lit ) hoisted on walk-
ing sticks. The banner was to protect
them from outrage by the Prussian
Uhlans, for the date was July 30, 1914,
and Europe the old, rich, cultured,
comfortable Europe of which they were
the last inheritors was rolling irresist-
ibly into war.
On that day, all over the Continent,
ambassadors were beginning the ritual
of destroying their papers. The task of
the diplomats had almost ended; the
soldiers were taking over. On that day
Kaiser Wilhelm sent a last appeal to
his imperial relative Czar Nicholas to
delay Russian mobilisation, but Cousin
Nikky’s advisers had already made up
his feeble little mind. In Vienna the
Austrian general staff was gaily planning
a quick, cheap victory over Serbia. In
Berlin Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg,
the melancholy bureaucrat who loved
Beethoven and Plato, told the Cabinet
with tears in his eyes: “The stone has
started rolling!” In Munich a young
misfit named Adolf Hitler threw himself
on his knees and thanked God that he
was alive at such an hour. In Budapest
nine-year-old Arthur Koestler ran away
from his governess and excitedly joined
the marchers shouting “Death to the
Serbian dogs!”
In England Asquith’s Liberal Govern-
ment was still hopelessly split and the
“Manchester Guardian” was trumpeting
the cause of neutrality: “Englishmen are
not the guardians of peace in Europe
• . . We care as little for Belgrade
as Belgrade does for Manchester.”
Throughout France conscripts were
streaming into the barracks, while one
observer watched holiday crowds return-
ing to the railway stations of Paris
sunburnt, noisy, joyous, loaded with
flowers from the countryside . . . young
lovers with their arms round one an-
other, fathers carrying sleepy children”.
It promised to be a glorious summer in
1914. “Perhaps it has never quite been
summer again,” said one English writer
looking back nostalgically from the
postwar years.
G. M. Thomson's book does not
pretend to throw fresh light on the basic
causes of the great catastrophe of 1914.
It is a day-by-day chronicle of the last
fateful 12 days before the storm broke,
of the personalities involved and the
decisions that were forced upon them.
On its own terms it is well-written and
adequately documented and it provides
a startling and often tragic picture of
the blunders, misunderstandings, irre-
sponsibilities and sheer fatalism that sent
20th-century Europe lurching to self-
destruction. “This is a war that nobody
wants, unleashed, as it were, by elemental
forces,” said Bethmann Hollweg, while
in London the icy, patrician Foreign
Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, was pound-
ing his desk and crying in a voice high
with frustrated passion: “I hate war!
I hate war!”
HPhere were so many crucial moments
A during the last 12 days when, by a little
imagination or a little more resolution,
the war might conceivably have been
prevented. If Germany (as she un-
doubtedly could have done) had per-
suaded Austria to be content with the
public humiliation of Serbia after the
murder of the Archduke Franz Ferdi-
nand instead of insisting on war; if
Russia had held up her mobilisation and
given the diplomats another chance; if
England had unequivocally declared that
she would fight if France became in-
volved.
But once the machine was started it
seemed that nothing could reverse it.
Russia was bound to defend the Balkan
Slavs against Austrian ambition; Ger-
many was bound by treaty to help
Austria against any threat from Russia;
France’s military alliance with Russia
bound her to intervene if Russia and
Germany went to war. What had been
a diplomatic exercise, the painstaking,
beautifully logical system of alliance
and counter-alliance, had ended not in
the preservation of peace but at the edge
of the abyss of war.
Of the great powers only England—
wealthy, canny, insular England, ab-
sorbed in her imperial mission and her
Irish troubles remained an enigma to
the chancelleries of Europe. Certainly
she had a military “understanding” with
France, but not even the British Cabinet
knew exactly how far this committed
them. Some of her ministers, led by
Asquith and Grey, were convinced that
Britain must intervene if France was
attacked. Whatever happened, the Royal
Navy was ready; Winston Churchill at
the Admiralty had seen to that. But the
Liberal Government was obviously
deeply divided. Almost to the last
moment the Kaiser clung to the belief
that Cousin Georgie in Buckingham
Palace would throw his influence behind
the neutralists. From Potsdam the tele-
grams went out to the rest of the family
clan of monarchs, one of the Lord’s
Anointed speaking to the others above
the hubbub of the politicians but,
alas, kings and emperors were by then
as much prisoners of the “elemental
forces” as the humblest subjects shout-
ing “Nach Paris!” or “A Berlin!” out-
side their palace windows.
Thomson's vignettes of his dramatis
personae are among the best things in
this book. Nothing could capture more
vividly the decadence and futility of the
Czar's court than his description of
Prime Minister Goremykin (“a worn-out
old man with long whiskers who sat on
a sofa reading French novels and
smoking cigarettes”) or of War Minister
Sukhomlinov, who held his post because
he kept his childish master amused with
funny stories. Thomson has his villains,
though he does his best to be fair to
them. One was Maurice Paleologue,
French ambassador in St Petersburg,
whose dreams of a revanche for 1870
destroyed any official French hope of
putting a brake on Russian military
preparations. Another was the Czar’s
envoy in Paris, Alexander Isvolski, a
corrupt intriguer who combined “the
unforgiving nature of a Tartar and a
perpetual odor of Parma violets”. But,
if any one man could be said to have set
the wheels of war in motion, it was
perhaps the supremely elegant, the
frivolous, the fatuous Count Berchtold,
Foreign Minister of the Austrian Em-
pire. “Berchtold pleases me,” said
Emperor Franz Joseph. “I have given
him my confidence. That is sufficient.”
Europe was to pay a fearful price for
the old emperor’s conviction that divine
providence and the will of the Hapsburgs
walked hand in hand.
However, it is about the drama in
London that Thomson writes with the

agonies of the Liberal conscience, the
final Cabinet meetings when Morley and
John Burns walked out rather than con-
sent to the war they loathed, of Chur-
chill grinning like a schoolboy as he
ebulliently sent orders to the fleet, of
Grey concealing his horror and emotion
as he dropped his precise phrases into
the silent House of Commons —all these
add up to an intensely moving climax
to his story.
Nobody knew what kind of a war it
was going to be. On August 5, when,
beckoned by Count Schlieffen’s ghost,
the grey flood of the German Army was
pouring into Belgium, an advertisement
appeared in the personal column of “The
Times”: “Wanted: A patriotic, wealthy
person to finance an ex-irregular officer
to raise a regiment of mounted infantry.”
The boys would be home by Christmas,
said the prophets. Join up, before it is
too late!
It was perhaps inevitable that that
summer of 1914 should come to wear a
borrowed garland of pathos and loveli-
ness. Looking back later, across the
bloody wreckage of the old Europe,
people remembered that English fields
had never drowsed in such peaceful sun-
shine, that the Vienna woods had never
borne such rich foliage, that the nights
of Paris had never sparkled so gaily. As
Paul Valery once remarked: “Nous
autres civilisations, nous savons main-
tenant que nous sommes mortelles.”
Boccaccio
Concerning Famous Women. Boc-
caccio. Allen & Unwin. 535. 6d.
retranslating and reprinting of
minor works by famous authors has
become very popular with British pub-
lishers lately. Often the results have
been happy. No doubt many who will
find this volume on a bookseller’s shelf
will want to possess it: it is hard to
resist when Boccaccio is the writer and
the word “women” appears in the title.
But most will be disappointed.
“Concerning Famous Women” first
appeared ten years after the “De-
cameron” and was well thought of by
Boccaccio’s contemporaries; at least it
did not earn him opprobrium. Here the
great scholar and classicist had found
a worthy theme. In a sense his sketches,
however fanciful, were historical popu-
larisations, welcome to an audience
glorying in renascent biography. They
all deal with women of antiquity. They
are genuine little moralities and even
where the related doings are scandalous
—incest will raise its head —the heroine’s
motives are pardonable if not good. As
Guido Guariano, the translator, points
out in his introduction, Boccaccio was
always a moralist, and to that extent
“De Claris Mulieribus” presents only a
change of emphasis. In all his works
he desired to instruct as well as to
entertain, but since we no longer
appreciate instruction we regret it when
the entertainment becomes tame.
Not that there are no delightful pas-
sages, full of the master’s typical irony,
but on the whole the material is pretty
dull. What makes the “Decameron”
marvellous is, after all, not its spiciness
alone —in this it fades before the
“Contes Drolatiques” but the picture
of a gusty age which it gives us. “Con-
cerning Famous Women” contains rela-
tively little of this. Things are discussed
more than described and the plentiful
side-comments illustrate attitudes rather
than people and events known to the
writer. He rarely uses goddesses and
queens as cloaks for living portraits.
Boccaccio wrote for a public which,
in important ways, was less conventional
than our own. It did not mind a highly
mundane treatment of religion. In the
“Decameron” is the novella of Fra
Alberto who makes love to Paulina dis-
guised as the Angel Gabriel. A close
parallel appears in this book with an
ancient Roman setting. In both works
Christian legends come in for some
rough handling, and in each Nature is
substituted for the theological logos. But
in “Concerning Famous Women” the
paganism is sedate even for his period.
The noble ladies who read it for amuse-
ment may have smiled at finding the
original goddess of love placed before
them as the original prostitute, but it is
hardly to be thought that they saw in
inconstant vestal virgins a likeness of
certain nuns. The robust laughter is
missing.
The style is graceful and urbane but
lacks glitter; it is said to be reminiscent
of that other book of Boccaccio’s, the
“Genealogia Decorum Gentilium”, which
was once held to be his masterpiece
and which has not been read for
centuries. But it has its felicities. Here,
for instance, is a commentary on the
kidnapping of Europa from a Phoenician
beach:
“For this reason I believe that it is
not good to give girls too much freedom
to stroll about and listen to the words
of strangers. For I have often read that
those who do this have their honor
tarnished by stains of disgrace which
afterwards could not be cleansed even
by the splendor of perpetual chastity.”
The translation is excellent and the
illustrations, whose source is not given
but which seem to be taken from a very
early edition, add to the pleasures of
a handsome production. Nevertheless, I
think it would have been better to select
only the best of these fables. One
hundred and four is too many altogether.

Misfire
The July Plot. Roger Manvell and
Heinrich Fraenkel. The Bodley
Head. 30s.
The Devil’s Discus. Rayne Kruger.
Cassell. 445. 9d.
YI/Tra the current war crimes trials in
Germany reviving Nazi horrors,
one wonders, not for the first time, why
decent Germans put up with the situ-
ation. “The July Plot”, which is a
detailed study of resistance within Ger-


many demonstrates only too clearly how
the complexities of the German nature,
combined with bad luck and unfortunate
timing constantly defeated efforts to over-
throw the regime. Worst luck of all was
the abortive attempt on Hitler’s life at
his Eastern HQ on July 20, 1944. A
time bomb planted almost under him
wrecked the conference room, but left
the Fuhrer merely shaken and bruised.
He seemed indestructible.
Authors Manvell and Fraenkel, by
means of extensive research and inter-
views with survivors, show that this inci-
dent was the culmination of years of
planning. In the weeks after the bomb
the SS were to make 7,000 arrests, un-
covering a network of conspiracy dating
back to 1937.
But for all the talking and planning
there had been little action. The original
resisters, generals of the old school, later
joined by younger Army men, clergy-
men, civilian leaders and a group of
philosophers known as the “Kreisau”
circle, had planned the government they
would form after the coup down to the
last detail, but found any real action was
constantly defeated by chronic procras-
tination, jealousy, weakness, and irre-
solution. The more determined knew
that to bring about a successful coup
they would have to kill Hitler first. But
this idea played havoc with Christian
consciences; and the “fence-sitters”
among Army officers used the excuse
that they could not break their oath of
allegiance to the person of the Fuhrer.
/\ne man, however, had the necessary
ruthless courage. He was Count von
Stauffenberg, a handsome aristocrat with
entree to Hitler’s circle. It was he who
planted the bomb, then rushed back to
Berlin to start the revolt. But it foun-
dered within a few hours through lack
of organisation and support. There was
actually treachery among resisters. There
was heroism but it was too individual to
be effective. Of Stauffenberg, even
Goebbels was to say, “What a man, what
intelligence. It’s quite incredible that a
man like that should have been sur-
rounded by so many idiots.” Himmler
quickly squashed the resistance, and
Hitler gloated over the humiliation, tor-
ture, and execution of its leaders.
This is the story of a sad debacle for
which the authors have employed the
emotional style of a popular thriller—
apt enough perhaps to reflect events
which today, only 20 years later, assume
the quality of horror fiction.
Rayne Kruger has summarised the
history of Thailand and its complex poli-
tical situation as a background to his
copious enquiry into the death of King
Ananda. The young man was found
dead in his bed in the royal palace in
Bangkok on the morning of June 9,
1946, with a bullet wound in his head.
By extensive research and interviews
with people in Thailand and Switzerland,
where the king lived until manhood, Mr
Kruger has set out to prove that he was
not assassinated, as is generally believed,
but that it was a clear-cut case of suicide
with no political involvement.
It certainly looked like suicide to those
closest to the king, but “accident” was
officially announced as being more ac-
ceptable to the Thai people. And it
was well-known that Ananda and his
young brother Bhoomipol (pronounced
poom-ee-pone) the present king, who
visited Australia in 1962 with Queen
Sirikit, were keen on shooting as a sport.
But, as the incident gathered political
force, the word “assassination” began to
be heard. Ananda was only 20, hand-
some, gentle, and courteous; he had so
much to live for, why would he want to
kill himself? He had not been long back
in Thailand from Europe, and had barely
begun to grasp the complicated political
set-up. On one hand was Pridi, then
premier, a liberal politician and scholar,
whom the author calls Thailand’s most
brilliant man. He had been the coun-
try’s war hero, having led the resistance
against the Japanese, but was now con-
sidered too leftist by powerful royalists.
On the other hand was Field Marshal
Pibul, a ruthless opportunist who had
sold out to the Japanese and afterwards
played a game of power politics, courting
the conservatives, and acting the dictator.
With the king’s death he saw his chance
to regain power, spread the word that
Pridi had been behind the assassination,
fanned up enough fervor to bring about
a coup and force Pridi into exile—where
he still remains. He lives in Peking.
The assassination trial, which the author
claims was a complete travesty of jus-
tice, was to drag on for six years, find
Pridi guilty, and order three seemingly-
innocent servants executed for com-
plicity.
In his concluding chapters Mr Kruger
presents a most convincing case for sui-
cide. To do this he has had to submit
the present royal family to a glaring ex-
posure of their private lives, since his
reason why Ananda died was an ex-
tremely personal one.

Summer. Peter Cowan. Angus and
Robertson. 21s.
Deter Cowan, well known as a short
story writer, long since developed
a prose manner as idiosyncratic as a
trade-mark. Anyone who has read his
stories will recall the short sentences,
flattened rhythms and monosyllabic
understatement which characterise the®'
the prose has something of the air of sen!
sitised Hemingway; its function has been
to follow the contours of frustration and
drouth, its limits are the limits of that
exploration.
Cowan’s first novel, “Summer,” is close
in manner to the stories. Throughout
Cowan works to simplify, to exclude ex-
cess detail and irrelevant associations
keeping the stage swept clean.
He moves his middle-aged protagonist
Henry Simpson, out of the city to a
country wheat siding in order to reduce
the situation to basic primaries (mar-
riage a failure, complacency punctured,
savorless salt of daily routines). In the
wheat country, Simpson finds a slow
regeneration with the neglected wife of
a coarse storekeeper: a regeneration rep-
resented in a continuous unrolling of
landscape in terms which make of it a
paysage moralise, inseparable from the
human lives which it contains. Cowan
manages this interaction with restraint
and delicacy.
*T*he central relationship of the book is
A effectively reduced to essentials and
consistently followed through; the sym-
metrical sub-plot (a low parody of the
overplot, the two being linked by the
figure of Tom Everett, the storekeeper)
concerns a growing affair between an
itinerant bulldozer-driver, handsomely
solipsistic, and the local bike, a pert
piece called May Riley. Cowan’s prose
does not sufficiently distinguish between
the younger and the older couple here,
Partly this is deliberate, as his ambiguous
use of “he” and “she” without antece-
dents emphasises from time to time; but
a certain thinness arises from Cowan’s
failure to emphasise the variety of human
lives, to distinguish in tone and rhythm
the reactions of somebody like May
Riley.
In “Summer”, Cowan has moved from
the short story to the novel with some
distinction. For a while there have been
signs that he needs this further expan-
siveness; but expansiveness carries with
it the responsibility of a more fully dif-
ferentiated representation of life. Now
that Cowan has come this far, he can
afford to coarsen his style in the expec-
tation of greater returns. He is at
present the exact converse of a novelist
like George Turner: Turner’s people are
hard Newtonian billiard balls, bouncing
off one another to form a society,
Cowan's delicate hearts drawing away
from any social interaction. If only we
could have billiard balls with hearts!

Today and Yesterday
BIRTHPLACE OF THE WOOL TRADE
Last week when it moved from the
Royal Exchange in Sydney the Wool
Exchange did not desert the historic
cradle of the wool trade. Its new premises
in Macquarie Place are on the site of the
home of one of the first men to raise
sheep on the Hawkesbury. The new site
is also that of the home of one of the
earliest of exporters and wool agents, the
India merchant, Sylvester Browne. It is
two or three doors from there, in Gover-
nor Macquarie’s day, that Reuben Uther
established his felt-making business in
conjunction with Simeon Lord, whose
great house on the corner of Bridge and
Pitt Streets and Macquarie Place was
the head office of his famous Botany
Woollen Mills, the first great privately-
owned woollen mills in the continent.
Not far away to the north is the site
of the first office of the Australian Agri-
cultural Company, the pioneer of the
great pastoral companies and importer
of the first great consignment of choice
Saxon sheep.
A few hundred yards to the south east
near Bond Street, John Macarthur had
his first Sydney home and still nearer
“beside the Tank Stream”, some of the
first sheep to be landed were penned—
and struck by lightning on the great night
ten days after the arrival of the Fleet in
Port Jackson; the night on which Botany
Bay held its first party “when the women
landed.” And what a party it was!
The first flock to be bred in the
colony was that of Edward Elliott, an
emancipist of the Parramatta District.
The real honor of gaining the first Span-
ish merino-type sheep of NSW belongs
to Governor King, as the honor of foster-
ing the first idea of a wool industry also
belongs to him. He it was who, passing
through Cape Town in 179.6, assured that
the Spanish-type stock disposable from
Colonel Gordon’s estate should be
brought to Sydney by Captain Kent in
H.M.S. Reliance.
The survivors of the perilous voyage
were divided up and sold to many offi-
cers, military and civil, including Macar-
thur and William Cox of Brush Farm.
Kent left his own with Captain Thomas
Rowley at the site of the Vineyard on the
Parramatta River and it was there that
merinos had their first taste of Austra-
lian grass. Rowley built up the respec-
table nucleus of a flock for Kent.
The Government bought and produced
a lot of rough wool in the first three
decades of settlement and this was manu-
factured at the Women’s Factory at
Parramatta.
Australia eventually entered into a
wider sphere as a wool country through
an accident. In 1800 John Macarthur,
sickened by the quarrelling and the libel
of the Colony, decided to sell out every-
thing and return to England. He offered
his farms and sheep to Governor King
for approximately £4,400. Governor
King, as part of his eager campaign of
persuasion to the Home Government to
make the purchase, sent home a set of
fleeces from his sheep. These were the
first New South Wales fleeces to be ex-
ported to England and they were received
with pleased astonishment and fulsome
praise by the wool merchants.
Tlhen Macarthur himself, having quar-
relied with King, demanded that he
should be sent home for court martial
and arrived at the psychological moment
when an England, constantly suffering
from interruption of trade with Spain,
was conning over the difficulties of pro-
viding regular supplies of fleece to feed
its vast and newly steam-equipped wool
manufacturing industry.
Thus it came about that exactly 160
years ago this month John Macarthur
had just finished his evidence before the
Privy Council on Trade in triumph, hav-
ing convinced the English that the future
of their wool industry lay in Australia.
He was preparing to carry home to Syd-
ney in his ship the Argo before the next
12 months was out, the first pure stud
merino sheep to be sent here. They were
also the first allowed to be exported from
England and came from the famous
Royal Stud at Kew. Those of 1797 ship-
ment were heavy derivative Dutch sheep.
He also brought the first wool classer and
expert (Wood) to make a report on the
sheep of New South Wales, and orders
for grants of the great Camden Park
estates where presently were born all the
techniques of breeding, wool washing,
classing, packing and handling which in
time made the Australian wool industry
great.

Oil Gets Another Boost
Two significant oil strikes in Australia one on a new
structure by Union-Kern-AOG at Alton, 55 miles south-
west of the existing Moonie oilfield in Queensland, and
the other by the Caltex-dominated Wapet group at Barrow
Island off the Western Australian coast have revitalised the
search for oil in this country.
Not only have these discoveries stimulated other oil ex-
ploration groups to step up their search programmes, but the
significance of such renewed activity has rubbed off onto other
industries. The buoyant share market on Australian exchanges
in recent weeks has enjoyed more than a casual underpinning
from oil because of the obvious ancillary advantages likely
to accrue from oil developments. History shows, however,
that more than the usual degree of patience is needed in oil
exploration.
Combined with a recent boom in base metal prices, Aus-
tralian share markets have enjoyed spontaneous activity not
usually evident immediately before the presentation of the
annual Federal Budget, due on August 11. Even at this late
stage, there are many who wonder if the Treasury may have
some last-minute thoughts on introducing curbs on an economy
that looks as if it might jump too quickly all at once.
A Frankenstein Monster
Of Institutions
Two separate comments from London and New York
A suggested that the growth of institutional investment in
the share market could be creating its own problems, mainly
by reducing liquidity and flexi-
bility in the market.
Institutional investment in-
variably is welcomed because it
provides price stability and
siphons off large blocks of
shares into the hands of long-
term investors. When someone
presses the panic button, insti-
tutions do not rush into the
market as sellers; instead they
prefer to ride out the inevitable
fluctuations.
But if the current rate of
growth continues, with a 30 p.c.
slice of the US share market ex-
pected to be held by institutions
when 1980 rolls around, the ex-
perts are wondering if this dom-
ination by institutions is a good
thing. In fact, the New York
Stock Exchange issued a report
last week stating that it was
desirable to increase the number
of individual stock owners to
Australian paint production

on page 61. Monthly production between May, 1963, and
April, this year, is illustrated by the above graph, together
with annual outputs since 1960-61.
maintain an active, liquid and responsive market, able to
absorb a reasonable amount of buying or selling.
The New York Exchange has reason enough to want an
increase in individual stock owners, since the recently pub-
lished figure of around 17 million stock owners undoubtedly
includes some duplications. The individual is good for
brokerage, whereas the institutions may tend to by-pass the
broking houses and indulge in over-the-counter trading among
themselves.
Further, the pension funds, mutual funds and other types
of institutions are not traders. They do not keep chopping
and changing according to political and emotional whims.
The mutual funds, second only to the pension funds as
owners of securities in America, aim their advertising both
at large and small investors to encourage them to leave their
money in the hands of experts.
The process of removing active individual traders from
the market is very marked in the UK at the moment where
unit trusts (already controlling more than £A5OOm. of public
funds) are enjoying a tremendous boom. The small investor
is unwilling to trust his judgment in an election year. The
unit trusts now say they are reaping a similar flow of money
as they experienced in 1959, also before an election.
Indicative of the remarkable growth in UK unit trusts is
a report in “The Economist”, London, that 17 new trusts have
been created this year and 24 block offers of units have been
made by existing trusts. New gimmicks have been intro-
duced to attract public money, including a Motorway trust
to cash in on the growth in roadbuilding and educational
unit trusts which really don’t
appear to have any connection
with education.
The success of these funds
and other institutional funds,
such as pension funds, is under-
standable from the point of
view that individuals don’t want
to be fussed with investment
problems (particularly if their
own attempts have proved abor-
tive). But there is good cause
for concern, as expressed by
the New York Slock Exchange,
that markets could become less
liquid and responsive. When
institutions want to unload, the
stock market may not be strong
enough to absorb their holdings.
This leads to their taking in one
another’s washing—a not alto-
gether laudable trend from the
broker’s standpoint.


Wool Reserve Price Will
Provoke Debate
On first glance, the Wool Board’s suggestion of a reserve price
within the otherwise traditional auction system looks like
an attempt to get the best of all possible worlds however
“conservatively” the reserve may be fixed.
Given approval of the Board’s eagerly awaited report by
the Australian Wool Industry Conference and by growers en
masse, no-one could doubt the chances of establishing a world
floor price from season to season, especially for Merino wool.
For the scheme proposes close collaboration with the New
Zealand and South African industries.
On most other matters the report does not appear unduly
radical. “Pies” and futures were obvious things to review. But
grower resistance may well develop against a scheme demanding
their initial support to the tune of £2O million. The primacy
of marketing or promotion also remains to be settled.
The whole report will be closely examined in next week’s
Bulletin.
Tread Carefully Through the
Base Metal Dreams
T ast week’s sharemarket partiality for base metals could draw
upon both local and overseas news in its support. A more
than yearlong interest does not look like waning just yet, since
all the signs continue to point fair.
That is far from saying that investors should allow mere
enthusiasm to run away with them. They cannot only bask in
the luxury of reacting to cheerful information from Broken
Hill South and North Broken Hill, knowing also that similar
reports are coming from the remaining Barriers and Mount Isa.
Any extension of the war in Vietnam or worsening of the
Malaysian situation must be viewed with close concern. Such
eventualities do not affect the simple supply-demand position
alone.
Deployment of the capacious US non-ferrous stockpiles
would immediately claim consideration. American policy in
respect of tin is already under pressure. Shortages are still
obvious despite the US Government feeling that an orderly
release of 20,000 tons in the year to next April could exactly
balance a production shortfall.
At the moment, some traders are talking about a tin famine
lasting 10 years or so. Under these circumstances they argue
for careful husbanding of the stockpile, even in the face of a
world tin deficit around 30,000 tons a year.
World prices, now above Korean war peaks, appear destined
to go higher. Dealers can only call for an effort to smooth out
a run of violent oscillations.
The selfsame expansion of world consumption applies to
each of the other base metals. Their prices are driven up by
users attempting to increase stocks in order to cover shortages
throughout this year and next.
Copper producers are still in the throes of trying to hold
price stability, though threatened by strikes at the principal
mines in USA, Chile and Northern Rhodesia. Meanwhile
the marginal stocks passing through the London Metal
Exchange sell well beyond the producers’ level.
The copper and tin ebullience has lately been augmented by
lead and zinc. Once again, according to producers, LME
stock shortages have given rise to unrealistic prices, in the case
of zinc made particularly perilous because of the battle with
substitute materials.
To hold the fort, Rio Tinto’s subsidiary, the Imperial
Smelting Corporation, proposes to fix its selling price for zinc
at £stg!2s a ton. Its decision was made when the LME price
stood about £stgl4 higher and found speedy agreement from
Consolidated Mining and Smelting Co., of Canada.
Australia’s Sulphide Corporation moved quickly to support
the Imperial line. LME’s first retort, though, was to push
forward prices up. As well, its chairman gave out an opinion
that the producers would be unable to meet demand durino
the next few months.
All this sort of thing, on the surface, looks very happy f or
investors. They shouldn’t get careless, however. Apart from
political complications, they might care to keep in mind the
perhaps slow but certain advent of marginal producers and
the havoc that hoarders (if they exist) could play on the
markets.
One Management Tackles
Its Costs Problems
TlTithin a most variable textile industry Bond’s Industries
has long been noted for efficiency and technical moder-
nity. The company does not intend to rest on its laurels.
Two hundred and twenty senior NSW employees, from
offices, mills and warehouses, were recently gathered into the
Dee Why factory to hear the chairman, Mr Russell Slade,
discourse about “wastage in its great form.” Mr Slade openly
explained to his staff: “If you interpret my expressions tonight
as the ‘old pep-talk routine’ then I have failed.”
He was, though, deeply concerned to obtain a mutual recog-
nition of the problem of rising costs and saw only one answer:
“still greater efficiency.” “The plague is waste, waste of
materials, waste in time, waste in unproductive effort of
manpower, waste by inefficiency of operation.”
In calling for a sharing of ideas, to be filtered through the
company's research centres, Mr Slade emphasised, “I am
not asking you ladies and gentlemen to work harder.” He
had no difficulty in pointing out, however, that “we are also
facing competition from countries to the North where the
pay is only 35 cents per day, and workers have less than one
twentieth of the holidays enjoyed by Australians.”
Other textile manufacturers might like to learn to face a
further challenge: “as well as this the textile industry is
undergoing a vast technological change. This change has
taken time to enter our industry as compared with the
appliance, automobile, chemical industry and so on, but those
who are complacent to this change will surely go out.”
No Early Australia-NZ
Common Market
"EVrlier optimism on the quick attainment of a form of
economic union between Australia and New Zealand now
looks decidedly premature. Australia’s Minister for Trade, Mr
J. McEwen, has made it clear that there will be no rushing of
hurdles in what he calls a complex situation.
A few months ago reports tended to stress the relative un-
animity of the two countries’ officials, who have been meeting
together regularly since May, 1963. Their findings are soon
to be discussed by Mr McEwen and the NZ Minister for
Trade, Mr J. R. Marshall.
Mr McEwen says these talks will be far from conclusive.
Enthusiasm for a “common market” concept may perhaps
have to be tempered. Anyhow those lofty hopes were really
dashed by each country’s list of excepted products. The trade
imbalance, also, hits New Zealand most and is not easy to
correct to any great extent with orthodox methods.
Some reductions in remaining tariffs, Australia’s on paper
and New Zealand’s on certain manufactured goods, might
become the first step towards agreement.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
How High are Australian Taxes?
Relating totals to GNP an oversimplification
Nobody will be very surprised but many
will be disappointed if the Treasurer
increases taxation in next month’s Bud-
get. Still others believe that, even if
taxes are increased, we have more unused
taxable capacity than most other countries
and so shouldn’t grumble.
Perhaps the most forthright statement
on the lowness of taxation in Australia
compared with other countries was in a
recent report by four economists, R. I.
Downing. H. W. Arndt, A. H. Boxer and
R. L. Matthews. Called “Taxation in Aus-
tralia: Agenda for Reform,” it was re-
viewed in The Bulletin on April 4 this
year. The report showed that, as a pro-
portion of gross national product, only
Japan, Greece, Portugal and Spain out
of 20 leading countries had tax propor-
tions lower than Australia’s 22 per cent.
In its latest Review, the Institute of
Public Affairs takes issue with the report
on the grounds that “this bald relationship
of total taxes to GNP” misrepresents the
position of Australia vis-a-vis other
countries and that it greatly oversimpli-
fies what in fact is an intricate and dif-
ficult exercise.
To get a fair comparison with the rest
of the world the IPA says it is necessary
to unravel the treatments in different
countries of five complicating factors.
First there is the extent to which taxes
are used simply to transfer income from
one section of the community to another,
for instance to finance social service cash
benefits and subsidies. It says these can-
not be regarded as a burden on the com-
munity taken as a whole, but are merely
a means of re-distributing incomes.
The IPA points out that the scale of
cash benefits of this kind varies very
widely between different countries. In
Australia, most social service benefits are
subject to a means test, w'hereas other
western countries usually make these
benefits available to the community as a
whole. In most parts of Western Europe,
State provision for social security has
gone further than in North America and
this country.
For example, all workers in Western
Germany are guaranteed 75 per cent of
their most recent earnings on retirement
and 90 per cent of their current earnings
m the event of illness. Benefits of this
Magnitude naturally require a high level
°f taxation, so w ? e should not be surprised
to find, says the IPA, that in Western
Germany taxes represent 34 per cent of
GNP. These social security taxes, which
are paid mainly in the form of contribu-
tions by employers and employees,
amount to 10 per cent of GNP. In ad-
dition to the high level of cash benefits,
the German Government also pays heavy
subsidies (financed out of taxation) to
keep down the prices of home-protected
farm products to the consumer.
If the cost of these subsidies is added
to the social security payments and the
total deducted from total tax collections,
the tax burden falls from 34 per cent to
20 per cent of GNP. In France, a similar
situation prevails to that in Western Ger-
many. After deducting social security
payments and subsidies the tax burden is
reduced from 32 per cent to 19 per cent
of GNP. If the same principle is applied
to the Australian position, the “tax bur-
den” falls from 22 per cent to about 16
per cent of GNP.
A second complicating factor specified
by the IPA is the extent to which health,
education and similar social services are
provided by Governments rather than
through private channels. Where, as in
Australia and North America, health
services are largely left to individuals to
provide for themselves, the burden tax-
wise is small compared, say, with Britain
and some Western European countries
where the health services are nationalised.
to some extent, also applies to
education. The IPA quotes some 1958
figures from an American study which
show education expenditure as a percent-
age of GNP for various countries. Aus-
tralia, with 2.9 per cent, is the lowest of
eight countries, comparing with 4.5 per
cent in the United States, 3.7 in Britain
and France and, the next lowest to Aus-
tralia, Italy with 3.4 per cent. Since then
the Australian figure has risen to 3.5 per
cent. This has bridged some of the gap,
but the IPA says that even so about a
third of education here is done in private
schools and this is not a charge on taxes.
It is clear, says the IPA, that, in West-
ern European countries, Governments
finance many services for the citizen
which in Australia (and in the United
States and Canada) the citizen finances
for himself. The wide disparities in taxes
as a proportion of GNP between the
former and latter groups of countries are
largely a reflection of a difference in
viewpoint about the appropriate spheres
of private and public responsibility.
Thirdly, there is the question of capa-
city to pay taxation. A realistic com-
parison of the weight of taxation between
countries ought therefore to take full
account of relative per capita incomes.
Latest United Nations’ figures show that
per capita income in the United States
is around £AIIOO, in Canada £ABOO,
and in Australia £A6OO. Thus, even
though the rate of taxation in proportion
to GNP may be slightly higher in the
USA and Canada, after paying tax the
average American or Canadian is left
with a substantially greater real income
that the Australian.
Fourthly, the impact of taxation on the
various sections of the community has
to be taken into account. For instance,
indirect taxes tend to impose a heavier
relative burden on lower and middle in-
come earners than personal income taxes.
on the book’s claim that indirect
taxes are relatively too high here
and should be reduced at the expense of
personal taxes, the IPA says that if social
security contributions in other countries,
where they are usually on a flat rate, are
disregarded, there is little weight to their
arguments.
Finally, in comparing tax burdens, it
is most important to look at the com-
position of Government expenditure. In
Australia, around 90 per cent of the cost
of public works expenditure over the post-
war years has been borne by the taxpayer
because of the inadequacy of loan rais-
ings. In 1962/3, Government capital ex-
penditure represented 9 per cent of GNP
compared with only .2 per cent to 4 per
cent in most Western European countries
and North America. The fact that the
benefits of much of the expenditure cur-
rently undertaken will only be experienced
in the fairly distant future means that
the burden on the present taxpayers is
all the greater.
When considering the burden of taxa-
tion, taxes used to finance social security
and other transfer expenditures or medi-
cal and educational services are of a very
different order from taxes spent on pro-
moting the development of the continent,
for instance on such projects as the Snowy
River Scheme, from which nobody gets
any immediate direct financial benefit.
Well-reputed economists have argued
that around 25 per cent of national in-
come (not GNP) was the outside limit to
which taxes should be raised (about the
present level in Australia). When taxation
exceeds 25 per cent of national income
people start to “set store on leisure” and
restrict enterprise and output.


“CROESUS”
“This Rather Interesting Stage”
Treasurer’s Budget prospectus still not precise
/Tynics may say that it has become
rather academic whether or not the
Federal Treasurer sets his cap at a deficit
or a surplus in his cash Budget next
month. With every penny of the Federal
Government’s revenue, including loans
and business undertakings taken into one
side of the account and all expenditure
including State as well as Federal capital
outlays on the other, recent years’ ex-
perience shows that a lot can happen
before the final tally for the year to throw
the whole estimating exercise into ruins.
Last year’s out-turn, when an estimated
£58.4 million deficit went astray to the
tune of £B5 million on the realisation of
a £27 million surplus, is as good an
example of this as any.
Cheap capital shouldn’t be made from
these swings between expectation and
out-turn, even though last year it does
seem that on income tax revenue, for
instance, the estimate shouldn’t have been
as much as £3O million astray. For one
thing, the fiscal year is now a much
longer journey for the Treasury than it
used to be when the capital account was
outside the Budget and, in any case, there
was more of a bank teller’s approach to
the ordinary Budget than there is today.
And, need one say it, the ordinary Budget
is so much bigger than it used to be,
quite apart from its extraneous new ap-
pendages. So in monetary terms the
swings are also bound to be bigger.
Again, a Treasurer may start a year
by wanting to give the economy a stimu-
lus but find that the need for this dimi-
nishes and even that a dampener is
needed before a year is out. The eco-
nomic setting of Government finances is
subject to changes independent of
revenue and expenditure forecasts.
JTffiis involves the Treasury experts in
“*■ keeping close watch on the crystal
ball. One must say that, errors in Budget
estimating to the contrary, they have
become increasingly vigilant in recent
years. In a manner of speaking, the fdct
was that last year, when possibly a deficit
of some order was demanded or at any
rate looked safe at the beginning of the
year, it became more and more evident
as the year progressed that a change in
course was necessary and that the Trea-
sury would have to play a positive part
in the process of containing effective
demand and liquidity against a back-
ground of acute labor shortages.
With the Budget still a month or so
off, even if he has thrown up some gene-
ral thoughts on the state of the economy,
such as in his speech to the Perth Cham-
ber of Commerce last week and, of
course, in the recent Economic Survey,
the Treasurer is obviously a lot more re-
luctant than he was last July to give a
Budget prospectus. Last July he set the
stock exchanges alight with a forecast
of a rip-roaring Budget, but when it came
to the event he had apparently changed
his mind and it was all anti-climax.
Not that it takes a particularly strong
divining rod to get the Treasurer's deeper
thoughts this year. As in so many words
he implied in Perth, the plain fact is
that the economy is pretty well bubbling
(but not over) with exuberance and
several potentially de-stabilising elements
have been rising to the top of the brew.
Perhaps it was not so much a matter of
the Budget ploughing a conventional
course between available revenue and
spending requirements, but rather that
the exuberance may have to be tem-
pered.
T»hus, on the one hand Mr Holt said
- 1 - the new financial year should be a
“big revenue year” for the Treasury, and
there would also be substantial increases
in expenditure to meet new housing and
education, social service undertakings,
planned expenditure in the defence
forces and loan redemptions on war
debts. The impression was that all this
can be looked after. However, there
would be the over-riding need for the
Government to avoid aggravating the
labor shortage and the problem of excess
liquidity, to which he might have added
the possibility of effective demand over-
stepping limits consonant with maintain-
ing price stability.
If there is nothing in this to indicate
precisely whether the Treasurer will be
budgeting for a deficit or a surplus this
time, the answer is probably that he
doesn’t know himself at this stage. What
the Treasurer himself is not saying on
this score, some people, including the
National Bank of Australasia, have been
saying for him. It hopes, like him, that
such a departure will be small, so it
thinks that “a cash surplus should be
one objective for 1964-65”.
Indeed, the bank is prepared to go
further. “If necessary, further measures
to avoid the resurgence of ‘boom’ con-
ditions can be contemplated, which
ideally may well be confined to the fiscal
sphere.” While prepared to go further
the bank is by no means convinced that
it will prove necessary and in fact leans
to the view that the tide of rising con-
fidence in the economy could well ebb,
TThrus, “if during 1964-65 the need
should arise for any further measures
of restraint on the economy, compliance
with the objectives of steady growth,
especially growth which brings with it
improvement in overall efficiency in our
productive and trading processes and
helps the cost structure of export indus-
tries should be given heavy weight by
the authorities. However, this need may
not arise, and in the coming months a
very careful watch will be necessary in
order to avoid any possibility that lack
of confidence as to what the future holds
might tip the scales towards a slackening
off in the general level of business ac-
tivity. At this rather interesting stage,
not all the risks are of a drift into in*
flationary conditions.”
Even if some would prefer not to bar-
gain on the pleasant economic vista per-
sisting indefinitely, most people will find
it difficult to see precisely why confidence
should falter at this stage. The only
perceptible cloud on the horizon is the
likelihood of some cost inflation and, as
the bank says, a little price inflation in
the making. Frankly, no other trouble
spots are in sight.
True, it is conceivable that imports
could rise to a scale which might strain
current export receipts and capital inflow,
but the cushion of overseas reserves is
the fattest we’ve had and only a super-
pessimist would discount any serious
trouble on that front, at any rate until
well into the year. There is no sign of
capital inflow weakening, nor of export
income falling away. Apart from wool,
export prices are strong.
However, the bank surely has its finger
on the industrial pulse so its doubts must
be respected. And if it has doubts, then
we must take it that the Treasurer will
also know of them. Yet it would seem
to be a pretty safe bet that they won’t
loom very large in his coming Budget
calculation.

Paint Industry Shares in Boom
Ready to enter into new fields
The Australian paint industry, which
has a valuable share of the housing,
domestic appliance and motor car boom,
l, a s been self sufficient since about 1930,
yet it is only in the last 10 years or so
that it has achieved technical standards
land quality equal to leading overseas
j countries.
To a large extent the Australian in-
dustry is dominated by the UK. Pinchin
Johnson and Associates Ltd (a member
of the Courtaulds group) holds 55 p.c.
of Taubmans Industries Ltd’s shares.
| ICI Ltd of England has a majority
j shareholding in ICIANZ Ltd, which
' owns BALM Paints Pty Ltd. British
Paints (Australia) Pty Ltd is wholly
owned by British Paints (Holdings) Ltd
of the UK. Lewis Berger and Sons
(Australia) Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the UK-based Berger
; Jensen and Nicholson Ltd.
It is this domination which has made
Australian paints competitive with the
best the world has to offer and has to
a certain degree meant cheaper re-
search, with Australian companies im-
porting know - how and technical ad-
vances from their overseas parents or
associates. UK interests in the Aus-
tralian paint industry have meant not
only that we are self-sufficient but that
we can also export. For the 11 months
ended May this year our paint export
and import picture looked like this:
£A 'OOO f.o.b.
Imports (11 months) Exports

Dyes, natural
and synthetic 3470 3409 nil nil
TOTAL ‘ 6676 5284 1080 1219
It is pleasing to note the decreasing
imports and increasing exports. Further,
it is to be hoped one day we will be
able to do without imported dyes and
pigments, which comprise roughly 80
pc. of our pigments, paints and
varnishes import bill.
We are now able to supply our own
industry with, as well as export, titanium
oxide and titanium white. Two Aus-
tralian producers, Australian Titan Pro-
ducts Pty Ltd at Burnie, Tasmania (a
wholly-owned subsidiary of British Titan
Products Co. Ltd) and the London-based
Laporte Titanium Ltd, which has a
titanium pigment plant at Bunbury in
Western Australia and is supplied with
dmenite, the raw material, by Western
Titanium, NL, now furnish our total
requirements.
Production of ready-mixed paint and
Camels in Australia for the first ten
Months of the 1963-64 financial year
was at a high level, with output totalling
12,774,000 gallons compared with
11,215,000 gallons for the previous
corresponding period. Production has
been showing a steady rise over the
years. Not even the credit squeeze (and
its resultant depressing effect on build-
ing, motor car and domestic appliance
production) slowed down output.
In 1960-61 the industry produced
12,729,000 gallons, in 1961 -62,
13,290,000 gallons and in 1962-63,
13,788,000 gallons. When final figures
for 1963-64 are released it is likely pro-
duction will show yet a further increase.
Production of emulsion-type paints
has also been increasing. In 1960-61,
2,494,000 gallons were produced, in
1961- 2,778,000 gallons and in
1962- 3,073,000 gallons. Production
for the first ten months of 1963-64
stands at 2,841,000 gallons compared
with the previous corresponding period’s
output of 2,572,000 gallons.
Oince the 1950 s great strides have been
made in the production of industrial
paint. One executive said: “Ten years
ago Australian paint manufacturers con-
fined themselves primarily to production
of house paint there was relatively
little being produced for industrial
purposes. It is now catching up rapidly
due to improved technologies and a
greater demand.
“There will be a big future in in-
dustrial coatings in Australia because
industry is expanding rapidly. In the
US there is an almost equal demand for
industrial and house paint. In not too
many years the situation will be the
same in Australia, and unless there
is some radical departure from the
materials used in industry and building
at present, it is unlikely that this pro-
portion will alter.”
The paint industry is concerned about
the influx of building materials on the
market which require little or no paint-
ing. Although their influence on paint
sales at present is not profound the
industry is continually conducting re-
search into uses of paint to compensate
for any reduction in sales the new
materials may cause. Observers in the
industry do not expect them to have a
marked effect for some time.
The emulsion-type paints, relatively
new to the Australian paint scene, are
gaining wider acceptance each year.
According to one executive they now
form the greater part of the domestic
paint market. Their popularity is due
to several factors. They are less ex-

India’s Fight for Foreign Exchange
Combating featherbedding and worker inefficiency
From RONALD ANDERSON
Featherbedding, the padding of jobs
with unnecessary workers, is rapidly
becoming one of India’s major econo-
mic problems.
India, like most of the underdeveloped
nations, is desperately short of foreign
exchange. Her reserves have fallen
steadily for the last 10 years and are
now less than a third of what they were
in 1950-51.
The Indian Government realises the
country must step up its foreign-
exchange-earning exports if it is ever to
make an economic break-through and
substantially lift the living standards of
its 450 million people.
Yet today hundreds of Indian firms
are finding it impossible to compete on
a price basis in the world market.
This may seem anomalous in a coun-
try where millions are unemployed and
underemployed, where per capita in-
come averages something like Is. 6d. a
day and factory workers are lucky to
earn £A2 10s. a week. It is a fact,
however, that while labor individually is
cheap, collectively it is very dear.
Many factors contribute to the high
production costs of Indian manu-
facturers obsolete and inefficient
machinery, out -of - date processing
methods, poor management controls,
etc. But featherbedding and worker
inefficiency are by far the biggest factors.
They are factors for which the Indian
Government is itself at least partly to
blame. It is Indian Government policy
to ensure work for as many people as
possible—a laudable intention, although
its result is to spread the available wages
over an ever-increasing number of
people. The Government’s attitude is
that it is better for 10 million workers
to earn half a rupee a day each than
for 5 million to earn one rupee a day.
This is, no doubt, a humanitarian
view. In practice, the Government’s
attitude, backed solidly by increasingly-
strong trade union pressure (most In-
dian factories are 100 p.c. unionised)
makes it impossible for firms to sack
inefficient or lazy workers and forces
them further and further into costly job
fragmentation.
Automation, in this atmosphere, is
more than a rude word —it is unpatri-
°tic, unhumanitarian, and just asking
for trouble.
In effect the Government says to In-
dia’s factories: “If a job can be done by
hand it must be done that way. If four
men can do the job now done by one
you must employ four.”
A big, largely-European managed
Indian wool textile mill serves as an
example. This mill employs 3000. The
work could be done equally well by
1000, even at low Indian standards of
efficiency. The mill has a battery of
Comet sock knitting machines. Each
machine has its own male attendant and
these men are now pressing for assist-
ants. In Britain it is normal practice
for one girl to attend to 24 such
machines.
The mill management has assessed
that its workers spend only 72 p.c. of
scheduled working hours actually on the
job and their working efficiency during
this brief time is only 50 p.c.
In otherwise modern Indian factories
one is startled to see thing being done
in the crudest of ways simply because it
uses more labor.
An example frequently seen is that of
rows of men, sitting patiently break-
ing stones and bricks with hammers to
provide aggregate for cement. Conveyor
belts, fork-lift trucks and similar hand-
ling aids are almost unknown. Every-
thing moves on a man’s head or in his
arms. If workers are laid off through
lack of raw materials or a power failure,
their wages continue indefinitely.
Nor is it possible to provide any real
incentive for the Indian worker to strive
harder. By law he receives a dear food
allowance amounting to 63 p.c. of the
pay scheduled for his job. He receives
this money whether or not he works.
Countless thousands of Indian factory
workers have found that they can scrape
by quite well on the dear food allowance
without bothering about the pay.
The attitude of these workers is: “We
can feed ourselves and our children on
the DFA, so why work harder just to
earn twice as much.” This altitude,
a common one in all strata of Indian
life, persists even among people who can
afford only one meal a day, and that
hopelessly inadequate nutritionally.
It is perhaps wrong to criticise the
Indian Government for making sure that
as many people as possible get at least
a meagre share of the industrial cake.
But the high labor costs resulting from
this featherbedding are having two
disastrous effects.
Internally, they have helped push the
prices of many manufactured goods to
ridiculous levels —often far higher than
a comparable, better-quality item in
Australia, for example. This places
many lines of consumer goods out of
reach of the great mass of Indians.
Externally, they have priced many
Indian exports out of world markets.
This in turn has led to some anomalous
situations. In the wool textile field, to
return to the same example, India's
mills must export because their annual
foreign exchange quota for imported
Australian and New Zealand wool
approximates their own foreign exchange
earnings in the previous year.
1%/fiLLS, to counter this situation, have
T"-*- pushed their selling prices higher
and higher on the huge, unsatisfied local
market and are taking losses of 20 to
50 p.c. on their export sales.
Sooner or later the Indian Govern-
ment will have to permit some rationa-
lisation in the industrial and manufac-
turing fields. Already there is wide-
spread disgust and disillusionment
among progressive manufacturers and
industrialists. Quality is falling off
rapidly. If the Government is not care-
ful it will find its export earnings de-
creasing instead of increasing.
Bully for Anderson Meat
4 record, of undisclosed amount,
was indicated by directors of Ander-
son Meat Industries Ltd for the year to
June 27. They accordingly increased
the dividend from 4i to 7i p.c.
Last year the company paid nothing,
as it was still extricating itself from the
troubles of 1959-60 when a loss of
£186,000 put the profit and loss appro-
priation account in debit.
However, the 1962-63 profit was
£112,995 or 18.4 p.c. on capital. The
previous best result was £138,231 in
1955-56. So the result for 1963-64
could be around 23 p.c. on capital.
In the first half of the year, directors
explained that livestock values were
extremely high because of the increased
demand for cattle throughout the in-
dustry, hence the better profits.
At the time the interim report was
released, early in April, the 20s. shares
were 17s. 9d. They have responded to
the news by climbing to 265. 9d. over
the intervening twelve months.

MARKET POINTERS
Through a Tumbler, Brightly
Tnvestors in Australian Consolidated
Industries were entitled to feel pleas-
ed with themselves last week when this
glass, plastics and building materials
giant reported an increase in its earning
rate from 14.5 p.c. to 16.1 p.c. and
raised its dividend from 8i p.c. to 9
p.c.
Perhaps the day may not be too far
off when shareholders will gain some
extra benefit, either by way of a new
share issue or a bonus.
Because of its diversification, ACI is
not so dependent on glass, which is meet-
ing competition from tins and other
packaging materials apart from imports
of glassware.
Nevertheless, big interest is being
taken in the current tariff inquiry on
glassware following the introduction of
temporary tariff duty on ovenware and
glass tumblers earlier this year.
Naturally enough, the retailers are
opposed to any restriction on imports,
but ACl’s glass-making subsidiary,
Crown Crystal Glass, has claimed that
it has been forced to cut its factory
staff from 1500 to 1000.
If the existing temporary tariff is re-
tained, Crown Crystal Glass obviously
must benefit and this would be a bull
point for ACI.

Phe offer by Jacoby Mitchell for Syd-
ney instrument maker Esdaile Hold-
ings Ltd is one of those affairs where
there is no equivocation about share
values. It is 6s. 6d. cash.
Before the offer, the market for Es-
daile shares was 3s. 9d.
If there is a margin of more than 3d.
between the market and the 6s. 6d.
cash offer, the not-so-greedy investor
who wants to make a quick profit could
step in.
Past history of takeovers has proved
profitable to those investors who move
into the market after a takeover offer,
as witness the auction for Max Wurcker
Ltd by Ozapaper and William Nash.
Even after Ozapaper’s third offer of
425., there is still something left in the
available market price, allowing for
brokerage, too. Or there was at the
time of writing!
the recent strong rise in base-
metal shares (particularly zinc pro-
ducers), the market is wondering if there
is likely to be a pause.
Special factors may assist Broken Hill
South with its copper interests, but the
world pattern of previous sharp rises in
lead-zinc prices indicates that sellers
and producers are always attracted.
A major psychological factor, of
course, is the fear that Vietnam may
develop into another Korea, thus caus-
ing stockpile pressure on base metals.

observers were a bit puzzled
by the sharp upward movement
of Boral shares and the gossip was that
Boral must be getting ready for another
takeover venture. It was even suggested
the company might be getting into the
concrete and quarrying business because
of the big increase in Government ex-
penditure this year on roadworks. It
already is in the road-paving business.
With the ss. shares up around 345.,
the company certainly is in a strong
position for a takeover bid, and evidently
has digested comfortably its earlier
swallows.

/Consolidated Equity Holdings has
moved off to a good start. Last
week the directors announced that a
maiden dividend, at an annual rate of
8 p.c., would be paid for the first two
months of operation to June 30. Divi-
dends of “not less than 7 p.c.” were
forecast in April's prospectus.
Even better, however, was the profit
performance for the two months. It
was £2614 equal to an annual earn-
ing rate of 15.7 p.c. on paid ordinary
capital. The dividend will take £1333
of this.
The effort is pretty good for a com-
pany of this nature. It was floated by
Melbourne broker Frank G. Irving and
Co. and is associated with the broker’s
investment activities. It also operates
as a sub-underwriter.
★ ★ ★
Detersville, the renamed Peters (Vic.)
1 organisation, has held up remarkably
well during the digestive period which
followed a spate of takeovers.
There was talk that the company was
having problems with its canning sub-
sidiary, but the 2s. shares, at 6s. 9d., are
still popular with buyers.
One of its competitors, Unilever,
appears to be doing well with its recent
takeover of Rosella Preserving, and
there is no sign that competition will
slacken in this field.
Food may be a good takeover area
but it is also in the headache zone.

New Light on the Wurcker Bids
Why depart from position of Australian control?
It is still up to Max Wurcker’s directors
to inform shareholders of the exact
reasons behind their continued recom-
mendation of the offer from England’s
William Nash rather than that from Mel-
bourne-based Ozapaper. Last week, The
Bulletin (page 61) suggested two
reasons for their attitude. These have
since been outweighed and overruled.
The first reason was that the English
offer represented hard cash in the hand,
whereas Ozapaper’s was mainly shares
which could drop in price and endanger
earning rates. Now that Ozapaper has
provided an alternative cash bid this
argument is invalid.
Even more important is that Ozapap-
er's managing director, Mr C. W. Moore,
contacted The Bulletin last week and
was quite emphatic that earning rates
would not suffer if the takeover was suc-
cessful. He said that the issue which may
be made to shareholders later this year
would not have any detrimental effect
either, even on the first result which
would be released after the merger.
A statement such as this casts a crucial
light on the matter and should remove
any fears which Wurcker shareholders
have in committing themselves to take up
Ozapaper units.
There is also very little possibility of
Nash entering into competition with
Ozapaper if its takeover bid is unsuccess-
ful. Although Wurcker’s operations are
connected with Nash’s, they are not really
in the same fields, ft’s a safe bet that
Nash would not compete unless it could
gain a foothold by buying an established
concern.
A bit of thought along these lines
raises the possibility of Nash bidding for
Ozapaper if it does not succeed with
Wurcker. If it does succeed, then it may
see advantages in spreading further and
bidding for Ozapaper anyway. Of course,
this is all very hypothetical yet it can be
too lightly dismissed.
The second reason put forward for the
Wurcker attitude last week was the pos-
sible existence of some personal connec-
tion with Nash directors. Even if this is
the case, the fact that Wurcker directors
now have the opportunity of keeping the
company under Australian control, with-
out harming shareholders’ pockets, must
surely outweigh the personal connection
angle.
As the two bids are now on a par, the
argument for or against Australian con-
trol is virtually the only one worth con-
sidering. Tinder these circumstances, one
can’t help feeling that Wurcker is being
rather stubborn by persisting to recom-
mend the Nash offer, unless there are
other considerations which must come

Touchdown and lightweight aluminium forgings support 115 tons of Qantas V-Jet!
Whenever a metal is required to be both strong
and light (as in the wheels and undercarriage
of the jet) aluminium is ideal. Certain alloys
of aluminium are considerably stronger than
structural grade steel while weighing only
one third as much!
Large bridges, powerful cranes, electrical
transmission towers and oil drilling rigs can
all be made from strong, light aluminium.
Aluminium nails drive into tough woods
and high explosive shells can be warded off
with aluminium armour plating. Aluminium’s
combination of unusual strength and light
weight has proved indispensable in transport,
building, electrical, packaging and other in-
dustries. And now a new company, Alcoa of
Australia (with its 49% Australian share-
holding) mines, manufactures and markets
aluminium in an enterprise that spans our
nation.
Aluminium conducts heat and electricity, and
reflects heat and light. It is non-magnetic,
non-toxic and impact absorbing. It is less
costly than other non-ferrous metals, and is
available in every form known to the metal
working industry. Aluminium has a wider range

Rothmans Unafraid
First of the market leaders to check
in with trading results for the year
to June 30 is Rothmans of Pall Mall
(Australia) Ltd, which reported an 8 p.c.
profit advance and a new earning rate
of 42.4 p.c.
After a couple of years marking time
in 1961 and 1962, with profits around
the £1.2 million, profit moved up to
£1,473,026 in 1962-63, and now
£1,609,866. Furthermore, latest pro-
visions were well above last year’s. Tax
provision increased from £853,886 to
£972,964, depreciation from £521,916
to £619,186.
Cigarette sales were temporarily
affected in the March quarter by the US
Surgeon-General’s report on the relation
of smoking and lung cancer, but sales
recovered to normal in the June quarter,
Rothmans’ chairman (Mr R. A. Irish)
said.
Its chief competitor. British Tobacco,
has been diversifying into businesses out-
side cigarettes and tobacco, as insurance
against this perennial threat to the
cigarette market.
Rothmans has no outside interests
except a wholly-owned investment sub-
sidiary which assists small businesses in
a paternal way. It expresses no fear in
the preliminary report anyway, on the
future for cigarettes.
The company claims that it maintained
its share of the total cigarette market
and this share may even have increased
during the year.
The 10s. shares are priced around
355. to give an income yield of 5.7 p.c.
assuming continuance of the 20 p.c. divi-
dend. Earnings yield is a very attractive
12.1 p.c. The shares would grace any
portfolio where income was welcome.
Effervescent Sugars
Cince Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd
made its first joint bid (with Ready
Mixed Concrete (UK) Ltd) for Ready
Mixed Concrete Ltd, it has positively
barraged investors with news of its activi-
ties.
An enormous profit in the year to
March gave directors heavy ammunition
for their campaign.
There was a release about macadamia
nuts being planted in Queensland, a
joint venture with James Hardie Asbestos
in the thermal insulation field and, fin-
ally, a 45 p.c. interest in Mt Newman
iron ore deposits in WA, along with
American Metals Climax.
Then the CSR chairman (Mr J. W.
Dunlop) presented shareholders with his
annual address.
Referring to the latest offer for RMC,
made with Blue Metal Industries Ltd,
the chairman explained entry to the basic
and expanding ready-mixed concrete and
quarrying industry as a logical and desir-
able addition to CSR’s building activities.
He admitted that there was some ex-
cess manufacturing capacity in Australia
for many of the building materials CSR
already produces.
The final consideration, if the offer
for RMC is successful, would involve
up to 21 million CSR shares, perhaps
10 p.c. of the then issued capital, and
over £2 million cash. The purchase
would “promise long-term advantage to
shareholders”, said Mr Dunlop.
The capital requirements for the CSR
group's operations are “exceedingly
large”, not only for the subsidiary activi-
ties but in the large expansion program-
me in raw sugar mills in Australia and
Fiji.
Bon Mot from Moteliers
T isted first on Sydney Stock Exchange
only last October, Moteliers Ltd,
proprietors of the Town House motels,
earned £42,399 in the year to June.
This represents 17 p.c. on the increas-
ed average capital employed, but 19 p.c.
on the capital ranking for dividend.
Dividend is 10 p.c.
The company made a one-for-eight
par issue in March, which does not rank
for dividend until 1964-65.
Inner City Motels, with a motel at
Randwick and a valuable site in North
Sydney, is currently earning profit at a
rate which fully justifies its acquisition,
directors said in their preliminary report.
The ss. shares now sell for about 6s.
sd. (yielding 7.8 p.c.). They were placed
at the equivalent of 6s. 7!d., but share-
holders have averaged down to 6s. sd.
with the issue.
No Cause for Clucking
Although Fowlers Vacola’s loss in
the year to April 30 was its first
in 44 years of operation, it came as no
surprise to the shareholders. They had
already been told, in the interim report,
that losses in the first six months would
probably not be recouped in the second
six months.
The main reason for the setback
appears to be the revision of manu-
facturing activities which was under-
taken after the 1962-63 result revealed
a profit slump from £52,000 to £3OOO.
The main aim behind the changes was
to place more emphasis on the pro-
duction of more profitable lines in the
company’s wide range of canned food-
stuffs.
The fact that the company is still
strong in liquidity enables directors to
distribute a steady 5 p.c. dividend for

the year, despite the loss. Last year the
payout was cut from 10 p.c. and some
of the dividend came from undistributed
profits, which is totally the case this
year.
But the payment of a dividend after
two very bad years seems to imply much
more than merely a strong liquid
position. Would directors make such a
move, and lower liquidity at a time
when every penny is probably needed
to boost profits, unless they were of the
opinion that the current year could
turn in a more satisfactory result? The
answer is probably no, especially as the
second half of 1963-64 was producing
profits.
Duncan’s Preference Issue
Tnvestors are being cautious about
A Duncan’s Efoldings Ltd, for although
directors have predicted that profit
before tax in the year to June would
exceed £lOO,OOO, the 10s. shares hang
about Bs.
Directors will wait for audited figures
before considering the payment of a
dividend. In 1962-63 the company lost
£30,770 and failed to pay a dividend
because home-builders were hesitant
about finance and NSW experienced an
unusually wet year.
The company wants shareholders’
approval to create 7 p.c. redeemable
preference shares. The plan is to issue
100,000 20s. shares privately at par, to
finance acquisition of control in another
Crown sawmill at Eden and to improve
general liquidity. The group already has
two mills in the Eden district and wishes
to increase the volume of housing timber
for the Wollongong and Sydney areas.
Present paid capital is £641,567 in
ordinary shares. The International
Finance Corporation of Washington,
which provided loan funds to the group,
also holds options over 600,000 10s.
stock units exercisable by October 31,
1967.
Balance of appropriation account
brought forward from last year was
£130,766. If the company has earned
£60,000 net of tax in 1963-64, a 5 p. c .
dividend appears a reasonable expecta-
tion.
Good Things from Glass
Shareholders of Australian Consoli-
dated Industries Ltd received their
first addition to income since the bonus
and cash issues of 1961 when directors
declared a dividend of 9 p.c. in respect
of profits for the year to June.
Profits rose 11 p.c. to a new height
of £3,701,000, representing 16.1 p.c. on
capital. The 1962-63 earning rate was
14.5 p.c., dividend 8j p.c.
The profit is before deducting a pro-
vision of £650,000 (1963, £635,000) for
the increased cost of plant replacement,
but is after £2,920,000 tax (less than
normal because of investment allow-
ances) and £3,144,000 depreciation,
£400,000 fluctuation in stock values, and
£lOO,OOO for internal insurance funds.
The group is Australia’s major glass
manufacturer and is also engaged in
plastics, engineering and packaging.
At 635. 9d. to yield 2.8 p.c. the 20s.
shares represent value for money. They
have been as high as 68s. this year and
70s. last year.
Lanray’s “Normality”
when is a company operating
“normally”? This question was
raised last week when Lanray Industries,
Melbourne-based distributor of builders’
hardware, reported to the Stock Ex-
change that 1963-64 was a “normal”
year of operation.
The statement was undoubtedly made
to assure shareholders, as profit last year
slumped from £BB,OOO to £6OOO. In the
seven months to January 31, a profit of
£20,000 was made. So the company has
had five months to make up the dif-
ference between this figure and £BB.OOO
—rather a difficult and almost impossible
task.
The answer must lie in the fact that
the £BB,OOO was not “normal” but
“abnormal”. Of course we will eat out
words if the result does turn out to be
as good as this. As this is highly un-
likely, we must suggest that the board
avoids such terminology in the future.
Seeds of a Better Year
Seeds Ltd reported better
sales and profits for the first half of
the current year to September.
In each of the last four years it has
shown profit advances. The result of
trading for 1962-63 was a profit of
£17,064, representing 16.6 p.c. on capital.

n ot reflected in the latest half-term re-
sults, directors said in the interim report.
In the half-year to March, Anderson’s
issued 80,800 ss. shares as part payment
for Duranbah and its subsidiary Terra-
nova Tropical Pastures Pty. Then it made
a one-for-two pap issue of 245,200 shares
to develop these acquisitions. In March
it issued 110,000 shares to the Australian
Estates Co. Ltd.
Directors consider that results from
these additional activities will be fully
effective by 1965.
Duranbah produces agricultural seed,
particularly the new cultivars for use in
tropical and sub-tropical regions. The
Terranova cultivars will be available for
the coming season. This subsidiary has
gained a substantial increase in sugar-
cane assignments in the Tweed River
area.
The ss. shares now show an income
yield of 4.8 p.c and an earnings yield of
10 p.c., while the shares are around
Bs. 3d. It could be that the earning rate
will be down this year, but the shares
are still interesting.
Caldwell’s Kitty
rUiDWELL’s Wines Ltd may repay
between Bs. and 9s. a share, in-
cluding the 2s. already distributed, the
liquidators for reconstruction told share-
holders in the annual report.
The company has been losing money
since 1952. It was put under receiver-
ship in 1956, then into liquidation for
the purpose of reconstruction in late
1959.
Shareholders will receive a distribution
of 2s. a share soon, and another 6d.
by the end of December. The shares
were originally 20s. units, and 2s. was
repaid in June, 1963. The 18s. units
now sell for around ss. 6d.
Successful Metamorphosis
Holdings Ltd, GM-H dealer
at Homebush, Chullora and Temora,
increased profit by 15 p.c. and its pay-
out from 8 to 12J p.c.
Profit was £1 10,597, after tax of
£67,488 and depreciation of £6373, in
the year to June 30, 1964, and contrasts
with the previous year’s result of £96,161
after £37,750 tax and £5lOO depreciation.
During the year, £lOO,OOO of the re-
maining £150,000 redeemable preference
capital was redeemed. (In 1962-63 pre-
ference capital was reduced from
£300,000 to £150,000 by redemption of
one share for every two held.)
The interim dividend of 5 p.c. absorbed
£18,750, including dividend on £150,000
preference capital, but the final of 7i
Pc., absorbing £22,773, includes divi-
dend on £50,000 preference capital.

struction (Aust.) Ltd the company worked
with heavy constructional and earth-
moving equipment from 1951. After
numerous difficulties, the company re-
commenced trading in 1958 under the
name Sydney Holdings Ltd following
the acquisition of interests in a group of
companies in the motor industry con-
trolled by the Sutton family.
Profits were earned each year there-
after. No dividends were paid until the
first and final 8 p.c. in 1963, when the
profit and loss appropriation account
at last showed a healthy balance.
The company has an interest (jointly
with Australian Fertilizers Ltd) in Aer-
ial Agriculture Pty, which it enlarged
in 1963-64 by the purchase of a major
shareholding in Super Spread Aviation
(Australia) Pty, taking it into Victoria.
The 2.9 p.c. yield showing on the ss.
shares, now priced at 21s. 6d., reveals
that shareholders are impatient for
another dividend lift. The 43.2 p.c.
earning rate gives plenty of scope, but a
15 p.c. rate is a reasonable maximum.
If this were paid in 1964-65, a present
purchase would yield only 3.4 p.c.
The shares therefore look fully priced
unless the final redemption of the pre-
ference shares, possible this year, paves
the way for a bonus to ordinary share-
holders.
Woollies for Gibson, Howes
T>undaberg sugar grower and miller,
Gibson and Howes Ltd, has added
to its grazing interests by the purchase
of the aggregate lease of the Wellclose
Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd.
The lease comprises Wakes Lagoon,
Wellclose, Sharpham and Bronte, cover-
ing 403,200 acres. The livestock (mainly
sheep) on these stations are included in
the sale.
Consideration was not disclosed, but
no issue of shares was involved.
The company first moved into grazing
activities after the purchase in 1961 of
Protein Stock Foods Pty, which was
engaged in experimental and develop-
mental work on the lot feeding of stock.
Then in 1963 Gibson and Howes
bought four sheep and cattle stations
covering 278,000 acres in the Charle-
ville district, which are operated by
Gowrie Pastoral Pty. Consideration was
150,000 20s. Gibson and Howes shares,
at that time worth about £562,000 on
the market.
The Wellclose properties, also in the
Charleville district about 400 miles west
of Bundaberg, will be developed as
breeding establishments for the Gowrie
properties.
At 575. 3d. the 20s. shares yield 8.2
p.c. and are not unreasonably priced at
that.
Firms Progress
A delaide Cement Holdings Ltd made
another record with its trading re-
sults for the year to May 31.
Profit moved up 17 p.c., or £42,641,
to £293,692. Earning rate is 23.9 p.c. on
capital increased in April, 1963, by a one-
for-three bonus.
Dividend is back to 111 p.c., the rate
paid in 1961-62, and compares with 121
p.c. paid in 1962-63 immediately pre-
bonus.
Tax provided was £253,200 and
depreciation £250,311, both significant
increases on the previous year.
The ss. shares now bring 245. to yield
a modest income of 2.4 p.c.
Casben in the Red
Productions Ltd, Sydney
sportswear maker, made another
loss in the year to April 30. Deficit on
trading was £30,843, compared with
£44,497 in 1962-63.
The company has paid no dividend
to ordinary shareholders in respect of
the last two years, although 10 p.c. was
paid for the previous three.
Sales were below budget. Although
production was restricted, stocks at
balance date were in excess of require-
ments and had to be discounted.
The market values the ss. shares at
2s. 4d.
Buckle Not Yielding
Oydney investor and motor trader
Buckle Investments Ltd skips its divi-
dend for the eighth year in succession.
Balance date has been altered to
March 31, and profits for the 11 months
were £11,876, compared with £9464 for
the previous 12 months. Paid capital is
£210,000.
The company became a subsidiary
(not wholly owned) of the Hong Kong

Turning from H-P to Secured Loans?
Scots-backed Associated Securities holds its profitability
By ROGER RANDERSON
Associated Securities Limited, with
commendable solicitude for its
shareholders and other investors, has
already made known its results for the
1963-64 year that ended on June 30 —
well in advance of publication of its
annual report.
This information is of special interest
to analysts who are currently probing
to discover whether hire - purchase
financiers have surmounted recent dif-
ficulties and are likely to enter a new
phase of rapid growth.
While Associated Securities cannot
compare in size with the leaders in this
field —lAC, GMAC, Australian Guaran-
tee and Custom Credit the market
rightly accords its shares a high invest-
ment status.
During the recent financial year As-
sociated Securities increased its “out-
standings” by £3,521,967 to £34,966,168.
This was an increase of only 11 p.c.
compared with 24 p.c. in the preceding
year, 1962-63.
At the same time, the company con-
tinued its policy of diversifying ad-
vances, so as to limit problems arising
from benevolent legislation which favors
defaulting hirers too much, and from
severe State taxes imposed on trans-
actions under hire-purchase contracts.
Advances secured by mortgages of
real estate, totalling £6,620,403 on June
30, seem to be static and are still well
below the peak of £8,217,926 reached
in the “land boom” of 1960-61.
The policy of diversification, however,
is seen in the past year’s increase in
secured loan contracts in respect of
which interest is charged monthly
frdm £808,602 to £3,338,670.
In the result the company was able
to increase its net profit by £79,141, or
16 p.c., to £580,717 for the 12 months
ended June 30. In addition to this, a
capital profit of £35,365 was taken
during the year.
Associated Securities, which stems
from a business started in 1926 and thus
accumulated experience from the dif-
ficult depression and war periods, has
long been esteemed for the soundness
of its lending policy and accounting
methods.
Profit is more likely to be under-stated
than over-stated, with 13.7 p.c. of hire-
purchase and loan outstandings and 34.7
p.c. of mortgage receivables deducted to
allow for “income yet to mature”.
In accordance with the company’s
sound past practice, all brokerage, hire-
purchase tax and other costs have been
written off from current earnings, so
that there is no over-statement of profit
by the capitalisation of such items as
“intangible” assets.
Directors, too, can be believed when
they state that “sufficient provision for
potential losses” was made before
arriving at the year’s profit.
The year’s provision for income tax
at £325,011 is slightly down by £14,915.
Associated Securities made a one-for-
ten bonus issue to its shareholders last
August, by capitalising £167,915 of its
large share premiums’ reserve.
The company also raised a further
£1,399,295 from shareholders (£559,718
in capital and £839,577 in share
premiums) by a one-for-three issue at
12s. 6d. for each share of ss. par value.
It is interesting to note that the net
effect of the bonus and cash issues was
to raise share premium reserves to the
much higher figure of £1,966,832, which
is now in high ratio to the increased
capital of £2,406,788.
This is relevant to the company’s
capacity to continue its policy of supple-
menting a high dividend (16 p.c. since
1960-61 following 15 p.c. for some years
previously) with frequent bonus issues,
although rising earning-power is also
necessary for this purpose.

jn recent years have been as follows:
1958- 1-for-10
1959- l-for-5
1961-62 l-for-4
1963-64 l-for-10
Borrowed funds had increased during
the preceding year 1962-63 by
£5,073,015 (the increase being chiefly
for terms longer than a year) to
£23,718,079 with an addition to its
interest commitments of only £94,000,
raising them to £1,466,652.
When the latest accounts are available
it may be helpful to consider the recent
year’s movements in borrowing and
interest expenses.
This company, to offset its high gear-
ing of borrowings to stockholders’ funds,
has always presented a reasonable
degree of liquidity; and one expects to
find in the coming accounts liquidity
that has been preserved.
It is true that the earning rate on
capital fell from 29.9 to 26.2 p.c. in
1963-64, which may be partly explained
by the one-for-ten bonus issue and the
fact that proceeds of the one-for-three
cash issue were available for only three-
quarters of the recent year, although this
was offset by the high premium charged.
As recently as 1956 the business of
the company had been almost confined
to the metropolitan area of Sydney.
In that year the powerful W. R. Car-
penter Holdings Ltd acquired a sub-
stantial shareholding through its sub-
sidiary, Southern Pacific Insurance Co.
Ltd.
Subsequent rapid expansion into
country areas and other States has been
associated with increased borrowing
power, assisted by securing the support
of other powerful institutions.
The great London-based Pearl Assur-
ance Co. Ltd has built up its stake in
the company from an original allotment
of 200,000 ordinary ss. shares at 12s.
each in February, 1959.
An even more significant association
began in April, 1960, when 2,150,000
ordinary ss. shares were allotted at 20s.
each to the Royal Bank of Scotland
and its famous hire-purchase subsidiary,
British Wagon Co. Ltd.
In furtherance of the policy of ex-
tending operations throughout Australia,
the company joined with Lensworth
Finance of Adelaide to form its South
Australian subsidiary and acquired Tas-
manian Finance and Agency Co. Ltd.
Associated Securities attempted in
1961 to amalgamate with Australian
Guarantee Corporation (on the footing
that it would issue three ss. stock units
and pay 18s. in cash in exchange for
four AGC ss. stock units), but the offer
was withdrawn after AGC diluted
capital by making a one-for-three bonus
issue to its shareholders.
Directors, with their advance an-
nouncement of 1963-64 results, stated
that “despite difficulties associated with
the hire-purchase industry generally, the
company has maintained its profitability
by directing its efforts to sound mort-
gage and leasing advances.
“All branches,” they added, “are
operating at a profit and the directors
are confident of continued progress.”
The recent price of 17s. 6d. for the
share includes the final distribution for
1963-64 of 4.8 pence (8 p.c.), which will
be paid on September 1, but, ignoring
this, the price offers a dividend yield
of 4.6 p.c. from an earnings yield of
7.5 p.c.
High points for the shares in recent
years have been: 1960, 25/6; 1961,
21/6; 1962, 23/7; 1963, 25/3; 1964,
21/6.
One can confidently recommend the
share at recent prices as providing
reasonable security, a satisfactory return
and long-term prospects.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Pricing the MLC’s Shares
Will dividend payouts justify present yield?
investment analyst could be ex-
cused from attempting an appraisal
of the shares of the MLC Limited, a
company which combines insurance
(including life) with appliance credit
retailing particularly when the com-
pany itself acknowledges the problem
by not consolidating the accounts. The
difficulties of making a really worthwhile
appraisal of the future “profits” that will
emerge from the life assurance business
may seem almost insurmountable. The
shares have varied in price from about
1235. to about 1455. over the last 18
months and the range of the All Ordi-
nary Index has been somewhat greater.
Today the shares are priced approxi-
mately midway in the above range, al-
though the dividend was increased from
13i p.c. to 15 p.c. from last December.
Even so, an immediate dividend yield of
2.2 p.c. is fairly meagre, particularly
when it is difficult to determine with any
precision the number of times the divi-
dend payout is covered by “earnings”.
So far as H. G. Palmer (Consolidated)
is concerned, the published accounts
follow the normal pattern. It would
appear that after the payment of the
dividend of £83,000 on the 10 p.c.
preference shares, there was £358,000
left for the ordinary shareholders, out
of which £124,260 was paid in divi-
dends. As all this information relates
to the period ended June 30, 1963, prior
to the acquisition of the company by the
MLC, it is not of very much assistance
in assessing the situation as at May, 1964
(when the MLC published its accounts
for the year to April 30, 1964). Fortu-
nately, H. G. Palmer decided to seek fur-
ther funds from the public and the pros-
pectus dated May 8, 1964, contains the
balance sheets as at December 31, 1963,
in similar detail to the MLC Ltd annual
report but only the figure for “Profits
before Tax” for the six months without
any detail. This figure represented an
increase of only li p.c. over the com-
parable figure for the same period two
years earlier.
*Phe impression therefore is that the
profits of the H. G. Palmer group
may well be nearly static. Certainly little
growth in the absolute amount is dis-
cernible since 1961, but this is to be
expected having regard to the troubles
which seem to have beset the appliance
retailers over the last two years. In view
of the fairly strong competition which
exists from the departmental stores,
some of whom employ “collector-sales-
men” to great advantage in this field, any
marked improvement in net profit before
tax would seem most likely to come
from a reduction in financing costs.
The extent to which the MLC’s “know
how” in collecting small amounts of
money from a large number of people
will assist the instalment credit business
administration of the H. G. Palmer group
is very difficult to assess. While “Indus-
trial” business represented under 18 p.c.
of the total funds as at December 31,
1963, the old Citizens Life Assurance
Co. was founded to transact this type of
business and no doubt this long experi-
ence will be of considerable value.
prospective benefits from the as-
A sociation with the MLC are more
readily appreciated in the interest cost
on borrowed money. From 1959 until
January, 1963, the rates offered by H. G.
Palmer had declined somewhat. Never-
theless in January, 1963, the maximum
rate was 8J p.c. The trend had been
as follows: —
Prospectus Maximum Interest
Date Security Rate Offer
27/ 2 /'59 Deposit notes 10 p.c.
l/12/'59 Deposit notes 10 p.c.
7/ 6 /'6O Debentures 8 p.c.
l/11/'6O Debentures 9 p.c.
12/ 4 /'6l Debentures 9 p.c.
11/10/'6l Debentures 9 p.c.
11/ 4/'62 Debentures 8J p.c.
6/ 7 /'62 Debentures 8J p.c.
9/ 1 /'63 Debentures 8| p.c.
Since affiliation with the MLC, the
maximum rate has been reduced to
7 p.c. and in the last prospectus this rate
was only available where the term was
10 years or longer. While it would seem
that the interest charge in the 1962/63
year represented an average rate of
9 p.c., this figure may be unduly high.
Without any increase in current borrow-
ings, the new association could represent
an increase in earnings of over 80 p.c.
in, say, the next 10 years.
Whether this potential increase in H. G.
Palmer’s earnings will mean that the
dividend paid to the MLC Ltd (for sub-
sequent distribution to the shareholders)
will be similarly increased is difficult to
say, though the potential will certainly
be there.
So far as the life office is concerned,
the shareholders’ participation depends
on the emerging surpluses from the
valuation of liabilities. When the MLC
Ltd was formed it was provided that,
while the MLC held at least 75 p.c. of
the capital of the Mutual Life and
Citizens Assurance Company Ltd, not
less than 2i p.c. of the declared profits
of the ordinary and industrial branches
would be carried to the credit of the
shareholders’ profit and loss account “or
such lesser percentage as may from time
to time be determined by resolution of
the company in general meeting . . . 0 f
which 21 clear days’ notice has been
given.”
The determination of these profits is
by an actuarial valuation and any attempt
to forecast the future amounts must be
hazardous. An examination of the last
six years may be of some assistance,
however.

Over this period the Assurance Funds
have been growing at the rate of 10 p.c.
per annum compound and the percentage
of surplus emerging has been increasing
steadily up to 1962. A similar growth
rate in Assurance Funds exists over the
last 10 years. Perhaps it is not unreason-
able to expect the same growth rate for
the next ten years. Whether the surplus
will continue to increase at the same rate
will depend on a number of factors, but
it may be worth mentioning that great
surpluses will emerge if the amount of
new business written starts to decline.
Consequently it would seem that project-
ing the surplus on a straight line basis
could err on the side of conservatism.
as it may seem, on this basis
the assurance funds could reach a
figure of £635 million by 1973 and the
surplus emerging could be of the order
of £57 million. Without taking into ac-
count any profits of the MLC Fire &
General Insurance Company Ltd or the
General Branch of the Mutual Life &
Citizens, the MLC shareholders could be
due to receive profits of £2.2 million, or
about 12s. per share, on the basis of the
number of shares now on issue.
It is now perhaps worthwhile looking
at the dividend record of the Mutual
Life & Citizens and the MLC. Taking
the 1953 year as a base (=100) ve have
the following pattern.
Available to
Year Surplus shareholders Dividends
1953 100 100 100
1954 125 111 108
1955 155 133 115

1961 425 184 179
1962 495 210 185
1963 545 245 200
From these series, it is clear that the
surplus available to shareholders has not
kept pace with the increase in surplus
(Continued on opposite page)


and, in fact, their percentage has been
reduced from 6 p.c. of the surplus of
the industrial and ordinary branches to
3 p.c. of the ordinary branch and 4 p.c.
of the industrial branch. On the face
of it, this decline in the percentage of
the surplus has now virtually ceased in
view of the “2\ p.c.” provision, but there
is no guarantee at all that the dividend
payout will keep pace with the “profits'*
and, in fact, even in the past it has failed
to do so.
Therefore it seems to me that those
who have done the earlier calculation
and produced potential earning rates
that on the current prices would show a
future earnings yield of about 10 p.c.
may like to consider the possibilities that
the key factor, i.e., the dividend payout,
may not increase by the necessary
180 p.c. over the next ten years as
Would seem necessary to justify the pre-
sent yield of about 2.2 p.c.
Even so it must be admitted that on
the face of it the MLC represents a better
growth situation than most of the other
listed companies in the “Insurance” sec-
tion of the Sydney Exchange list and it
1S therefore priced accordingly.
BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Handling Momentous Expansion
Prestige consolidates Holeproof acquisition
The acquisition of Holeproof Indus-
tries Ltd in December, 1963, made
1963-64 a momentous year for Prestige
Ltd.
It has contributed to an approximate
doubling of turnover to £12,782,303 and
of fixed assets to £4,861,680.
Profit for the year to March 31, 1964,
rose from £312,786 to £567,660 after
providing £437,445 (1963, £249,499)
for tax and £514,092 (£260,845) for
depreciation.
Holeproof contributed £310,490 of
this profit increase. As its acquisition was
not complete until March 24, just five
days before the end of Prestige’s ac-
counting year, Prestige applied these
profits to reducing the group item “Good-
will on consolidation.”
Eliminating surpluses on the sale of
fixed assets, the comparable figures of the
old Prestige group, excluding Holeproof,
were £264,848 in 1963-64 against
£312,786 the year before.
The reason for the reduction in pure
Prestige profit was mainly a £59,113
write-down in the Australian consumer
goods division, due to changes in de-
mand patterns.
Here, then, are two examples of Pres-
tige financial conservation—worth noting
for investment purposes.
The Australian Holeproof group, pur-
chased from the receiver of Factors Ltd
(which retained the NZ Holeproof
group), mostly complements the Prestige
group and should bring stability and
economies of scale.
The Prestige group produces hosiery,
lingerie, dress fabrics, furnishing fabrics,
tufted, knitted and woollen and worsted
fabrics, as well as doing yarn processing,
dyeing and finishing in plants at East
Brunswick, Sunshine, Ararat and Hor-
sham in Victoria, and Stratford, Qpu-
nake and Wellington in NZ.
Some 60 p.c. of Prestige turnover is
in the manufacturers’ raw material and
servicing divisions. These have been
subject to a fair amount of imports com-
petition since 1961. The subsidiary,
Johnson Bros Pty, which, with licences
for Banlon and Agilon processes, makes
nylon rayon and terylene yarns, benefited
from emergency duties imposed by the
Tariff Board in August, 1963.
Holeproof also produces women’s
hosiery and lingerie, but the other pro-
ducts socks and sockettes, footwear
(jiffies), men’s and boys’ shirts, men’s
underwear, boys’ wear and men’s
pyjamas—represent diversification, with
emphasis on the consumer-goods’ market.
The Holeproof plants are located at
Box Hill, Brunswick, Deepdene and
Ringwood (Melbourne suburbs) and at
Rydalmere (Sydney).
Holeproof will maintain its public
image and operate independently as a
trading unit. Directors reported, when
1964 accounts were released, that the
benefits of integration were already evi-
dent at production levels.
The price of the Holeproof purchase
was £3,510,000, towards which Prestige
has raised £1,591,716 by a private place-
ment of £500,000 6i p.c. redeemable
preference shares and a three-for-five
issue of ss. ordinary shares at 4s. pre-
mium.
In July, 1963, Prestige had made a
one-for-five bonus issue, three years after
a bonus of similar proportions. After
the January, 1964, premium issue, paid
ordinary capital became £1,617,357.
Preference capital is now £978,050,
being £103,050 in 8 p.c. shares, £375,000
in 5 p.c. shares, and £500,000 in 6i p.c.
redeemable shares. (The latter are not
listed.)
Shares of the premium issue did not
rank for dividend from 1963-64 profits.
The redeemable preference issue was
arranged after balance date. The group
profit as shown in the accompanying
table, which includes the Holeproof profit
because the depreciation and tax figures
relate to the enlarged group, therefore
shows an inflated earning rate of 64.4 p.c.
The earning rate on the final ordinary
capital, and after taking into account
the enlarged preference charges which
will operate this year, would be 31.6 p.c.,
a more realistic figure.
Alternatively, the earnings of the
Prestige group (excluding Holeproof)
represented only 23.7 p.c. on bonus-en-
larged capital, compared with the pre-
bonus rate of 34.1 p.c. in 1962-63.
In the five years to 1961-62 the aver-
age earning rate was 18.9 p.c., so that
the apparent prosperity of the last two
years should not blind the investor to
the fact that it is a highly competitive
business, and a very variable one too.
Although the loss of 1951-52 was
unique for this company, 1960-61 saw
a sharp dip in profits as well.
The working capital position as at
March 31, 1964, looks pretty tight. Al-
though that would have since been relax-
ed somewhat by the redeemable prefer-
ence issue, it is not as healthy as Prestige
would probably like.
Directors said they had endeavored to
maintain a proper balance between capi-
tal and borrowed funds during the last
expansive year.
It seems likely that the next issue of
funds will be another premium issue, at
least within the next couple of years.
The 5s. shares at 13s. 2d., now yielding
a 4.7 p.c. return, appear very sound
holding.

AUSTRALIAN ESTATES CO. LTD
New Phase of Prosperity
A rise in dividend from 12 to 20 p.c.,
announcement of a one-for-two
bonus and a future cash issue were the
items of good news contained in the
1963 annual accounts of Australian
Estates Co. Ltd.
In the year to December 31, the four
interests of the company —in sugar,
sheep, cattle and agency experienced
excellent conditions together, so that net
profit roughly trebled from £5tg313,806
to £5tg903,323.
Tax provided rose from £358,315 to
£926,345 and depreciation charged from
£475,707 to £642,647. The net trading
result was far and away the best per-
formance in 69 years’ trading. It rep-
resented an earning rate of 42.2 p.c. on
ordinary capital after taking care of
£16,844 preference charges.
Directors announced it was time the
issued capital was brought in line with
the value of assets employed, hence
the one-for-two bonus to holders of
ordinary and A ordinary shares. (The
last such handout was a two-for-one in
1955 after a run of good seasons.)
The company now proposes to call on
stockholders for further capital, and to
increase its overall borrowing powers.
(In 1956 the company issued £1 million
in 6} p.c. convertible secured loan stock.
Conversion rights have now expired, but
£707,270 of stock still appeared in 1963
accounts.)
Otherwise the company’s expansion
has been financed by retained earnings
and the substantial cash flow from
depreciation. The 1963 distribution to
shareholders required £257,159, which
was covered 3.4 times by group earnings
and 6.7 times by the total cash flow.
Plans are in hand to spend £stg2.4m.
on the two sugar mills in the next three
years and £stg4oo,ooo on a wool store
at Portland. Hence the company’s
demand for fresh working capital.
While Australian Estates is largely of
academic interest to Australian investors
(shares are listed in London only), its
affairs are of more than passing interest
to its competitors, employees and clients.
Also, since balance date, Australian
Estates has taken up 110,000 ss. shares
(or 13 p.c. of paid capital) in Andersons
Seeds Ltd and will provide loan funds,
too.
Acting as wool selling brokers in Mel-
bourne and Brisbane, Australian Estates
handles approximately 3.9 p.c. of the
Australian wool clip.
As a pastoralist, the company has
cattle stations in Queensland including
a Shorthorn stud at Granada, and sheep
stations in Queensland and NSW, in-
cluding Merino studs at Terrick Terrick
(Qld) and Oolambeyan and Raby (NSW).
Recent purchases were Kooralbyn, a
cattle fattening property near Brisbane,
Wainui, a green lot-feeding cattle fatten-
ing property on the Darling Downs,
Terrica, a wether property near Ingle-
wood, and Eurella, a sheep - breeding
property near Roma. Eurella offsets
some of the carrying capacity lost
through resumptions of company proper-
ties for closer settlement.
With sugar mills at Kalamia and
Pleystowe, Australian Estates crushed
961,000 tons of cane to produce 142,900
tons of sugar, making it the third
largest producer in Australia. Company
cane farms at Kalamia (near Townsville)
produced 25,000 tons for crushing.
Pleystowe is in the Mackay district.
Although the proportion of company
resources employed in the sugar industry
is not known, it was this section of the
business, enjoying exceptionally high
sugar prices, which was largely re-
sponsible for the splendid trading result
in 1963.
However, average wool values in-
creased by 14 p.c. over 1962, cattle
prices were improved, seasons generally
kind, and the Australian economy
buoyant.
An extension to the Brisbane wool
store was opened in February, 1964,
with modern facilities to handle an in-
creasing quantity of wool as economic-
ally and efficiently as possible.
Large sums have been spent over the
last decade in modernising and increas-
ing the capacity of the sugar mills, d
the present expansion plans are to hand
the expected combined peaks of 136(J
tons in 1964 and 166,000 tons by
compared with 94,000 tons in recerti
years.
_ . I
Sugar prices reached a postwar record*
level of £stgl03 a ton on October 3)
1963, but eased back to £stg90
January 29, and have since collapsed tn
£46.
The International Sugar Council ex.'
pects world sugar supplies to again
right this year, so that, as imports
countries exhaust their stocks, the price
should recover.
The Committee of Enquiry appointed
in 1963 by the Queensland Government
thought it reasonable to expect the world
free market price would remain higli
enough to justify considerably higher!
production targets.
Australian Estates has entered a new
phase of prosperity and development,
Its 1964 accounts should make very
good reading.

SOUTH AUSTRALIAN BREWING CO. LTD
Another Call for Cash?
>TThanks to the new Companies Act,
shareholders of The South Australian
Brewing Co. Ltd now have a far more
realistic view of their company’s trading
performance.
For the first time, accounts presented
for the year to February 28 disclose tax
and depreciation provisions. The net
profit, as divulged by the company, rose
from £534,569 to £601,669, after pro-
viding £575,000 for tax and £349,165
for depreciation on brewery and hotel
plant and furniture, and on freehold
properties.
That profit was also arrived at after
“providing” £194,500 for property and
plant development. In the directors’
report this is variously described as a
provision and an appropriation. It is
“the amount set aside in accordance
with the established policy of your
directors to meet the capital expenditure
involved in the necessary modernisation
and further development of the com-
pany’s large and valuable investment m
breweries and hotels”.
As the Tax Commissioner sees it. tins
is an appropriation of funds utter
arriving at the net profit. The net proht,
therefore, is more realistically set nt
£796.169, although this is not directly

nt item has never been mentioned in
previous accounts. Earning rate on that
profit is thus 16.5 p.c.
The very modest earning rate shown
by previous profit figures was never
taken at face value. Yet it was not
possible to read any more meaning into
the accounts in the absence of informa-
tion from the company.
The two bonus issues in September,
1959 and 1955, both in the ratio of
three-for-five, were tangible evidence
that the company had secret reserves.
The accumulated “provision” for pro-
perty and plant development stands at
£964,381, shareholders are now told.
This is shown as a special provision
together with reserves in the 1964
accounts. In the past it was credited to
the freehold property account, out of
sight of shareholders. In fact, the 1963
accounts simply said: “Freehold property
(at cost or valuation, less amounts
written off) £6,571,131.”
If shareholders have not been confided
in until the latest accounts, at least the
company gives every evidence of very
sound management.
The company has two breweries in
Adelaide, the West End Brewery pro-
ducing draught beer and Southwark
Brewery specialising in canned and
bottled beer. Distribution is throughout
South Australia, the Northern Territory
and to Broken Hill. Modernisation of
the breweries and plant has streamlined
production a continuing process to
promote efficiency.
Over 100 freehold hotel properties are
owned. Increased rental income is
derived from the remodelled hotels, and
the new ones added to the chain the
Hendon, Mansfield Park and Locksleys
Hotels completed in 1961 and 1962, and
the Warradale Hotel in 1963. The Rose
and Crown Hotel is almost completed.
Investments include a 25 p.c. interest
taken in its SA competitor, Cooper and
Sons Ltd, which suggested a share
exchange as mutual protection when the
UK Charrington brewing group was
looking for a launching pad in Australia.
Shares in listed companies have a net
book value of £40,967 but a market
value of £185,440 (another little inner
reserve), while shares in unlisted com-
panies had a book value of £251,831 on
February 28, 1964.
The deficit working capital position
is fairly common to brewers and is no
cause for alarm. The company had cash
on hand and deposits of £612,408 to-
wards the payment of income tax and
the final dividend, which require
£816,365.
The last cash issue was a one-for-four
at par in 1955, preceded by a one-for-
three at par in 1953 and a one-for-two
at par in 1950, to finance the programme
of remodelling and rebuilding which has
now tapered off. Nevertheless, the 1964
accounts show commitments for capital
expenditure of £290,290.
A dividend of 10 p.c. was paid for
the second year running to re-establish
the rate paid before the last two bonuses,
with their subsequent dividend cuts.
The company has an enviable record
of continuous profits and dividends,
going back to at least 1920. Capital
benefits have, particularly since the war,
sweetened the rather plain fare of modest
dividends.
Seeing more value in the stock, in-
vestors have pushed the shares to un-
precedented levels. The current price
of 22s. 5d. for the 5s. shares shows an
income yield of only 2.2 p.c. It is there-
fore no time for the timid to buy, but
present shareholders are sitting pretty.
Seeking a hint from the chairman
(Sir Roland Jacobs), in his 1964 address,
as to whether the next capital benefit
will be a cash or bonus issue, his state-
ment that new techniques are continually
making even the latest brewing plant
and installations obsolescent suggests it
may be another call for cash.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Adjusting to the New Price Levels
Then there's the Budget to be kept in mind
T ast week I was exuberant about the
£450 rise in market price of the
portfolio. This week it rode past that
record with a £6OO increase. So in two
weeks it’s risen almost as much as it
did in the first six months of my financial
year. Perhaps I should concentrate on
investing only in July and relax for the
rest of the year.
For many months I’ve been preaching
about the stock market being too low
when viewed against the background of
the obvious economic prosperity.
Now that the fillip has come, it’s
hard to adjust to the new price levels.
Complicating the picture is the Budget
in two weeks or so. There could well
be a reaction to these share rises,
sparked off by fears of this Budget.
Then in typical fashion there could be
a counter-reaction for a couple of days
just prior to the Budget. Translating this
theory into action, it would be sell in
the next week and buy in the following
week.
One of the most prominent rises has
been Hanimex. Never let it be said
that I’m a traitor to that very efficient
and progressive company. But I did feel
there was an opportunity to sell part of
my holding. Based on an average pur-
chase price of 10s. 4d. and taking into
consideration dividends, the sale showed
a handsome profit of £330.
It was (fortunately) a case of patience
with Hanimex. Serving as a contrast
was Anderson Meat, which had been
purchased only early this month. A
record result and a 7} p.c. dividend had
the effect of putting those shares up to
275. After such a violent rise for a
company which has had more than an
irregular record, it seemed likely that
the market could slide back. An average
sale price of 265. returned a profit of
£Bl.
Continuing on this spree of taking
profits, the 250 Cresco shares were sold
out at 775. This added a further £69 to
the barrel.
Now would seem an appropriate time
to look at the remaining stocks in the
portfolio, especially as most of them
have results due shortly.
A few words have already been said
on Hanimex. This year’s earning rate
should compare favorably with last
year’s 33 p.c. The stock is still selling
on a high 10 p.c. earnings yield.
Malleys is the one remaining ap-
pliance stock in the portfolio. Without
the burden of bad debts and with the
much increased demand for washing
machines, Malleys should be able to turn
in a very much higher profit than the
figure of £171,000 last year.
Conkeys seems to be progressing well
during the current issue. These shares
also seem well worth holding for the
result.
Tableland and Ardlethan are the two
tin stocks in the portfolio. Prospects
for the Australian producers seem so
good that another tin stock, Aberfoyle,
was the only purchase this week. I’m
prepared to back almost anything in the
tin stakes.
Conquip has settled down at 10s. 9d,
ISAS (NSW) has already paved the way
for. the excellent results expected from
companies in the earthmoving industry,
Chemical Materials was very ably
reviewed in The Bulletin last week,
After a lengthy article, “Security
Analyst” concluded that “the shares
certainly seem quite attractive”.
Petries is the unknown stock of the
portfolio. Still waiting for details of the
offer by country grocer Permewan
Wright, the shares have remained fixed at
9s. An announcement is long overdue,
G. J. Coles directors have issued a
long statement about rights for different
quantities of shares held. They seem
most anxious to get the shareholder to
do his own rounding off. I’ll stay on
the fence and observe.
Draffin Everhot is the Melbourne rep-
resentative. Its place is deserved. Three
of the latest acquisitions, A. J. Dawson,
Treloar and Smith & Miles have only
been listed this year. Each is doing well,
All I ask of them is to repeat the per-
formance of such relatively new listings
as Protector Industries, Martin Wells
and Eric White.
Kay shares were bought after a heavy
fall. This year’s result should show
that the 10 p.c. dividend is not in danger.
The last North Broken Hill,
seems to be the pick of the metal stocks.
Lead, zinc and silver show no sign of
losing strength.
The week’s transactions were:
SOLD
400 Anderson Mleat, 26/- £5ll
1000 Hanimex, 16/6 £863
250 Cresco, 77/- £950
BOUGHT
1000 Aberfoyle, ctg, 14/3 £727
This bounces the account up to
£1975 credit —just a few pounds below
the amount the portfolio was started
with four years ago.

Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.
‘TAB-VITA’ B GROUP FORT
tablets — A Nicholas Product.
Tear out the ad now — don’t put
it in the ‘too hard’ basket, please.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Living With the Pesticides
Plenty of talk and little listening
rTHERE is a noted scientist in Melbourne
—a man with a world reputation in
his particular field —who will not allow
his children to eat certain kinds of vege-
tables.
His friends consider him slightly pecu-
liar.
His explanation is simple: he is suffi-
ciently concerned about pesticide residues
in foods to adopt this personal stand. He
is not sufficiently educated in the subject
to do more than that.
This little anecdote just about sums up
the whole pesticides problem. No one
knows enough about them.
Chemical pesticides and insecticides
came into widespread use in all advanced
farming countries after the war. There
had been, for fifty years, utilisation of
the fairly simple poisons such as strych-
nine and arsenic for control of pests and
weeds.
The new pesticides developed during
and after the war are of a totally different
nature. And there are far more of them.
In Australia alone there are about
1400 different pesticides based on some
200 chemicals. In USA there are some
54,000 formulations incorporating 500
compounds.
Most of these are developments of war-
time experiments (on both sides) of the
gases which were never used. In the post-
war years they made possible the develop-
ment of the world-wide agricultural
chemicals industry.
To the credit of this industry, the bene-
fits to agriculture can be seen wherever
they have been used. This cannot be
denied and it is unrealistic to try to show
that the world could get along without
them.
What has been seen by all too few
people, however, is. the danger inherent
in uncontrolled use of chemical pesti-
cides.
There are some people, and they in-
clude scientists, who assert that the risk
of atomic destruction is less than the risk
of mass suicide by continued and ever-
increasing use of chemical pesticides.
Again it is a question of all too few
people knowing all too little about the
problem. The average mind fails to even
begin to grasp the situation.
When a trained mind does come for-
ward with some public statement the
reaction is almost invariably a “scare”
headline followed by a story which
stresses that “there is no need for panic.”
So most of us turn over to see who
won the cricket at Leeds and eat a break-
fast of which very probably only the salt
has not at some stage or other been
treated with a chemical. None of us can
really escape absorbing some chemical
residue.
The health-food addicts and the vege-
tarians are living in a dream world. The
“natural” foods which they eat are usually
grown under conditions which require
more chemical spraying than most.
With most meats the process begins
when the animal grazes a pasture which
has been treated with chemicals to con-
trol grubs and mites. The fact that chem-
ical residues still remain after the animal
has been killed and the meat cooked
indicates the persistence of some
chemicals.
Scientists involved in pesticides re-
search say there is nothing unusually
abnormal about this. The body absorbs
all kinds of residues which eventually are
passed out of the system.
It’s all very well to talk about alter-
native methods—biological pest controls,


for instance. At present these are largely
theories. Chemicals work.
A few weeks ago Dr D. C. Trainor, of
the Division of Occupational Health in
the NSW Department of Public Health,
had an informative article published in
the Journal of the Australian Institute of
Agricultural Science.
Sometimes articles of this nature are
so full of scientific jargon that the average
person cannot comprehend them. This
one hit the nail on the head.
Dr Trainor said that scientists had
found traces of DDT and DDE in all of
25 meals collected from restaurants and
institutions in NSW.
fact that tolerances (i.e., minimum
A levels) were established for the
amounts of these substances in foods
indicated that some uneasiness existed
about the wisdom of introducing into
the human organism chemical substances
which were alien to it. Dr Trainor
warned against a complacent attitude to
food residues just because there was no
discernible disease pattern attributable
to them.
He recalled that early radiologists had
exposed their hands to apparently harm-
less radiation for years before the disas-
trous results became known.
Now it was being discovered that cer-
tain operators using the fairly common
spray dieldrin could have convulsions
four months after exposure to the spray.
This period of latency was disquieting
because of its uncertain length and the
possibility that effects could extend be-
yond the generation exposed to toxic
influence.
What accounted for this latent period?
In a mild criticism of his scientific col-
leagues, Dr Trainor said the usual explan-
ation was that the poisons caused organic
injury which became apparent only later,
when the organism started to age or was
subject to physiological stress. It was dif-
ficult to know whether to accept this as
a plausible hypothesis or merely a glib
explanation.
Another question not easy to answer
was why the same poison affected dif-
ferent people in different ways. It was
known 50 p.c. of experimental animals
died. It was not known why 50 p.c.
recovered.
If it was assumed that metabolism was
constant in mode within a species, it
might be the efficiency and rapidity of
de-toxication which accounted for this
difference in the particular experiment
with animals.
The term “individual susceptibility” was
widely used but it was really nothing
except a facile phrase used to describe
a little-understood phenomenon.
The occurrence of aberrant (different
from the normal) symptoms was also
puzzling. Such symptoms were sometimes
seen in organic phosphate poisoning. It
might be that the explanation of many
of these phenomena would come through
rapidly accumulating knowledge of
cellular physiology.
While the future might bring new
controls of pests, we were at present com-
mitted to chemical methods. The best we
could do, therefore, was to try to achieve
results with those chemicals which were
least toxic to man and to use them with
the greatest care.
Dr Trainor said he believed that a
large proportion of the world’s population
must now be carrying insect spray resi-
dues in human fat as a result of the
widespread use of modern pest sprays.
Echoing Dr Trainor, the deputy chief
health officer of the Victorian Depart-
ment of Health, Dr R. J. Farnbach, said
that his department was advertising for
a chemist whose main work would be the
analysis of foodstuffs for pesticide resi-
dues.
Traces of pesticides from the chlorin-
ated hydrocarbon group had been found
regularly in food samples already in Mel-
bourne. We simply did not know enough
about the effects of these insecticides on
humans.
The chief chemist of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, Mr F. H.
Williams, said chemical residues had been
found in samples of fruit, vegetables, meat
and milk. It did not mean people were
being poisoned, though there was enough
concern for an investigation.
A number of other scientists supported
the view that there is no need for whole-
sale panic but great need for real and
thorough investigation.
One man who has been talking about
pesticides for nearly two years is Vic-
toria’s Director of Wildlife and Fisheries
Mr A. Dunbavin Butcher.
His officers have proved that birds
animals and fish have died as a result of
pesticide residues, although the nearest
actual usage of the pesticides has been
hundreds of miles distant. If something jj
not done the time may come when there
will be no wildlife at all —the problem is
as serious as that.
Apart from the aesthetic loss, says
Dunbavin Butcher, the total upset of the
balance of nature in this destructive pro-
cess could well include man himself. A
small illustration: If in eradicating cer-
tain pest insects a whole range of pollina-
ting insects is also destroyed then large
areas will automatically become waste-
lands.
Dunbavin Butcher, because of his job,
has a strong section of the public behind
him in matters relating to the conser-
vation of wildlife.
It is fairly apparent, however, that
while most of these people can become
very heated over such things as shooting,
foxhunting and trapping, few worry about
pesticides.
In reality the total effect of all these
conventional methods of destruction of
wildlife is infinitesimal compared with
the chemicals cycle. The killed grub is
eaten by a bird which lays eggs which
are eaten by a native cat and so on.
Whether it is wildlife or ourselves who
will suffer, nothing will happen much
until the public at large begins to take a
real interest in the pesticides problem.
It is a problem calling for the greatest
possible integration of effort —from
Governments, scientists, farmers, manu-
facturers, and consumers. So far there
has been a lot of talk with few listening.
Danger Point not Reached
Dairy Council and butter prices
With butter up yet again the big ques-
" tion is: Will Australians follow the
lead of consumers in America and the
UK and change to margarine?
We use margarine now, of course. But
not to the same extent as people in other
countries who no longer buy butter at
all - or only rarely.
Obviously the Australian Dairy In-
dustry Council, the supreme organisation
body of the industry, does not think a
danger point has been reached. In fixing
wholesale increases of 16s. 4d. a cwt. for
butter and 9s. 4d. for cheese they
obviously believe that the housewife will
be prepared to pay.
But one dairy industry leader stated
in an interview that the housewife would
be “pleased to do this because she realises
that the farmer needs an increase as
much as anyone else.”
The new price of ss. 2d. may not be
the straw to break the Jersey’s back; but
clearly there is a limit beyond which the
average family simply cannot go.
The farmer will not get all of the
increase. Probably he will get 50 p.c.
and the manufacturer 50 p.c.
The Dairy Industry Council states that
this rise has nothing to do with the recent
£1 increase in the basic wage. It was in-
evitable anyway, the Council says, be-
cause costs have increased 11 p.c. over
the last four years. The new price rep-
resents a mere three p.c. increase in
price.
It is hardly worthwhile getting into an
argument over the part the basic wage

I rise played or did not play in this in-
crease. The point is that the farmer in-
evitably suffers every time there is a
L s ic wage rise. He would not suffer over-
much if prices remained stable, but the
pattern has become pretty well estab-
lished; every time the basic wage goes
pp, the prices of all the manufactured
goo ds he needs to run his farm go up,
too.
It has been estimated that 60 p.c.
of the costs of running a farm fall into
this category (wire, fence posts, tools,
implements, etc.).
The dairy industry is probably the
best organised farm group in Australia
and only recently the chairman of the
Australian Dairy Produce Board, Mr
E. G. Roberts, spoke of the history of
this organisation in giving the annual
George Howey Memorial Oration.
His oration is interesting because it
indicates that nothing is really achieved
quickly and that other farming groups,
interested in achieving the kind of
stability that dairying has, would be well
advised to examine the dairy organisa-
tion.
It is somewhat unique in that it en-
compasses not only the farmer but also
the manufacturer of dairy products. In
this sense it is a kind of trade union and
chamber of manufactures rolled into one
a formidable merging of interests.
Mr Roberts said: “It pays to be organ-
ised in this highly complex, modern
world. It behoves the modern dairy far-
mer to think on a rather wider plane
than his predecessors. It has become
necessary for him to think beyond im-
mediate gains in terms of cash returns
either from commercial transactions or
the public purse.
“With the increasing degree of inte-
gration of industry organisation, he must
learn to use his obvious political power
with discretion and executive skill and
play for meaningful long-term gains.
Whether he likes it or not, he is donning
the executive vestment and it is largely in
his own hands whether he advances or re-
tards future industry organisational pro-
gress.”
Mr Roberts outlined the growth of
dairy organisation: —
The first realisation of the advantages
of organised marketing came with the
Federal Butter Committee, formed in
1914-18, to fix national prices for butter
and cheese and to negotiate sales of sur-
pluses to the UK. But government con-
tracts ended in 1921 and so did the
Federal Butter Committee and its suc-
cessor, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce
Pool.
The next step was the voluntary Pater-
son Plan of 1926. The plan’s objects were
to use the local market as a buffer to
absorb the more extreme variations in
export earnings. However, higher local
prices proved too much of a temptation
for some factories, which pulled out.
The Commonwealth Dairy Produce
Equalisation Committee was formed in
1934 with supporting State and Federal
legislation.
The Australian Dairy Produce Board
was also set up in the 1930 s to provide
facilities for orderly overseas marketing
of butter and cheese. It became adviser
to the Commonwealth Government on
industry and quality matters, and be-
came consolidated during the 1939-45
war through UK food contracts.
These finished in 1955 and the board
was then given the power to buy all the
butter and cheese sold to the UK.
Following this, the Dairy Produce
Board amalgamated the interests of dairy
farmers’ organisations and manufac-
turers’ and managerial organisations.
It is certainly wise on the part of the
dairy organisers that the Dairy Produce
Board sets aside 0.5 p.c. of the national
product value for promotion. This is
£300,000 a year, which is peanuts com-
pared with the promotion funds for
wool.
But then the wool industry is in 1964
about where the dairy industry was in
1926 as far as organisation goes.
Lifting Argentinian Meat Exports
Still another threat to Australia’s markets
/Cattlemen in Uruguay and Argentina
are reported to be up in arms over
the trial shipment of US beef to the
European market.
The South American beef exporters
are expected to sound out Australia and
New Zealand on the idea of a conference
so that “traditional” meat markets may
be preserved.
While tradition is hardly a sound
argument in business talks, the idea of
such a conference may be worthwhile.
One of the factors overlooked in our
recent dealings with the US has been
the fact that South America has been
having a series of droughts and other
ailments (political turmoil in Argentina)
which have reduced its export potential.
And the South American potential is
very great.
The rancheros may never again be
able to pay the virtually non-existent
wages they did pre-war, and the killing
works may never again have such a tax-
free sphere of operations. But should
Argentina be able to straighten things
out she could rapidly become the
world’s biggest exporter again and could
almost certainly undercut Australian
beef.
The present Argentine Government,
headed by President Illia, is trying to
get a programme under way which will
restore Argentina as the main supplier
of beef to Europe and as a big supplier
to the US.
Two meatless days a week have been
suggested.
Argentinians have the highest per
capita consumption of beef of any
people in the world about 200 lb. per
year.
Cut lunches are virtually unheard of.
Workmen take big steaks with them to
the job and barbecue them over an open
fire.
A National Meat Board has been in-
structed to get on with the job of en-
couraging pasture improvement, stream-
lining packing methods and developing
large areas of State-owned lands for
cattle grazing.
The drive to get Argentinians to alter
their eating habits is not the only means
the Government has of increasing ex-
ports (probably it is the least important),
but it is certainly eye-catching.
Beef-loving Argentinians have some
inbuilt prejudices against other foods.
Lamb and pork are supposed to be bad
for the liver, and bread and potatoes
lead to physical decadence.
With a tremendous increase in wheat
acreages and bumper harvests, bread
(and other grain derivatives) may be
expected to take a larger part in the
national diet on a purely cost basis.
The draft legislation at present in the
US to impose hard and fast quotas (still
regarded by most observers as a largely
political move) may not be the only
threat to the market for Australian beef
in the US.
