MALTHOID is probably better known than all other
roofings put together. MALTHOID covers buildings
practically all over the world. There is no climate in
which MALTHOID is not suitable. From Alaska to
Central Africa is a far cry; yet in both these extremes
of climate MALTHOID will be found to be the most
popular roofing. Neither heat nor cold have any dele*
terious effect on it, whilst amongst its many virtues it is
absolutely waterproof.

Rodin on Art and Photography
The Red Page
How is it that a sculptor gives to a
figure carved from a block of marble the il-
lusion of life? How, especially, does he
manage to convey in a stationary figure of
bronze the idea of movement? This inter-
esting Question, among a host of others, is
answered by the greatest of modern sculp-
tors, Auguste Itodin, in Art (Ifodder and
Stoughton, per Angus and Robertson, 19s.
net.), a work that should be in the hands
of every artist in the world. Rodin did not
A\iite this book, but allowed a literarv
friend, Paul Gsell, to discuss with him the
meaning of his art, am. to collect these in-
teresting talks in this sumptuous and fully
illustrated book. In their discussions Rodin
fiequently mentioned pictures and statues
by other masters, and his analysis of these
classics is made easy for the reader by the
reproduction of the works criticised. But
Rodin’s own wonderful works form the bulk
of the 60 magnificently reproduced illustra-
tions.
Let us listen awhile to one of the most
interesting discussions between master and
disciple:—
Ait, Rodin pronounces, ’'cannot exist
without life.. How could the joy o"sorrow
lu f-t object—of a block of stone—
aftect us. The illusion of life is obtained
in our art by good modelling and bv move-
ment.. . Movement is the translation from
one attitude to another.
. simple statement, which has the
air of a truism, is, to tell the truth, the key
to the mystery. The painter or the sculptor
....represents the transition from one pose
to another—he indicates how insensibly the
first glides into the second. In his work we
still see a part of what was and we dis-
cover a part of what is to be. An example
wil enlighten you better. You mentioned
just now the statue of Marshall Ney by
.Iv' - ~ (> you recall the figure clearly?”
.A®’ says. “The hero raises his
swoid. Shouting -Forward’ to bis troops at
the top of his voice.”
“Exactly. Well, look at it s*till more
cioseiy. You will then notice this : the le'-s
1 wu and the hand which holds the
sheath of the sabre are placed in the atti-
tude that they had when he drew—the left
leg is drawn back so that the sabre may be
easily grasped by the right hand, which' has
just drawn it; and as for the left hand it
is arrested in the air as if still offering the
sheath. JNow examine the body. It must
have; been bent slightly toward the left at
the moment when it performed the act
which I have described, but here it is erect
here is the chest thrown out, here is the head
ruining toward the soldiers as it roars out
the order to attack; here, finally, is the right
arm raised and brandishing the sabre.
bo there you have a confirmation of what
1 have just said; the movement in this
statue is only the change from, a first atti-
tude—that which the Marshal had as lie
drew his sabre—into a second, that which
he had as he rushes, arm aloft, upon the
enemy.
. that is all the secret of movement as
interpreted by art. The sculptor compels, so
to speak, the spectator to follow the de-
velopment of an act in an individual. In
the example that we have chosen, the eyes
are forced to travel upward from the lower
limbs to the raised arm, and, in so doing,
they find the different parts of the figure
represented at instants, they have
the illusion of beholding the movement per-
formed.”
t studied then Rodin’s wonderful “St.
John, and saw “that the rhythm of this
figure led, as Rodin had said, to a sort of
evolution between two balances. The figure
leaning at first, all its weight upon the left
toot, which presses the ground with all its
strength, seems to balance there while the
eyes look to the right. You then see all
the body bent in that direction, then the
right leg advances and the foot takes hold
the ground. At the same time the left
shoulder, which is raised, seems to endea-
vor to bring the weight of the body to this
side, m order to, aid the leg which is behind
to come forward. Now, the science of the
sculptor has consisted precisely in imposing
all these facts upon the spectator in the
order in which I have stated them, so that
their succession will give the impression of
movement.”
Jt
“Have you ever attentively examined in-
stantaneous photographs of walking figures?”
Rodin suddenly asked Gsell. “Well, what
did you notice?”
“That they seem never to advance. Gen-
erally they seem to rest motionless on one
leg or to hop on one foot.”
“Exactly! Now, for example, while my
St. John’ is represented with both feet on
the ground, it is probable that an instanta-
neous photograph from a model making the
same movement would show the back foot
already raised and carried towards the other.
Or else, on the contrary, the front foot
xvould not yet be on the ground if the back
leg occupied in the photograph the same
position as in my statue. Now it is exactly
for that reason that this model photographed
would present the odd appearance of a
man suddenly stricken with paralysis and
petrified in his pose If, in fact, in in-
stantaneous photographs, the figures, though
taken while moving, seem suddenly fixed
in mid-air, it is because, all parts of the
body being reproduced exactly at the same
twentieth or fortieth of a second, there is
no progressive development of movement as
there is in art.”
“But, 5 ’ asks his friend, “have you not
IS ed „i many l imGS to me that th e artist
ought always to copy nature with the
greatest sincerity? Well, then, when in
the interpretation of movement he com-
pletely contradicts photography, which is an
unimpeachable mechanical testimony, he
evidently alters truth.”
• ISCf r .°l )] ilodin, “it is the artist who
io truthful and it is photography which lies,
tor in reality time Moes not stop, and if the
aitist succeeds in producing the impression
ot a movement which takes several moments
toi accomplishment, his work is certainlv
much less conventional than the scientific
image, where time is abruptly suspended,
it is that which condemns certain modern
painters who, when they wish to represent
horses galloping, reproduce the poses fur-
mshed by instantaneous photography.
(>ericault is criticised because in his pic-
ture hpsofti Races,’ he has painted his
horses galloping, fully extended, rfntrc d
fc/ve. throwing their front feet forward and
their back feet backward at the same in-
stant. It is said that the sensitive plate
nevei gives the same effect. And, in fact,
in instantaneous photography, when the fore-
legs of a horse are forward, the hind legs
having by their pause propelled the body
onward, have already had time to gather
themselves under the body in order to re-
commence the stride, so that for a moment
the tour logs are almost gathered together in-
the air, which gives the animal the appear-
ance of jumping off the ground, and of being
motionless in that position.
. “Now, I believe that it is Gerieault who
is right, and not the camera, for his horses
appear to run: this comes from the fact
that the spectator from right to left sees
first the hind legs accomplish the effort
whence the general impetus results, then
the body stretched out. then the forelegs
which seek the ground ahead. This is false
in reality, as the actions conld not be
simultaneous ; but it is true when the parts
are observed successively, and it is this
truth xalone that matters to us, because it
is that which we see and which strikes us.”
.* •*
Rodin’s criticism raises an interesting
problem for the photographer. How can he
represent a man walking so as to get the
illusion of movement in Rodin’s “Man Walk-
ing”? The. problem is not insoluble; for
the mechanism of the instantaneous camera
may, in expert hands, help the eye to see the
two movements on the same plate. An in-
stantaneous photograph at high speed is
taken by a mere slit in the blind travelling'
rapidly up the surface of the ex-
posed plate. Thus a high-speed in-
stantaneous photograph represents not
one moment of exposure for the whole
plate, but an exposure that begins and
ceases at the bottom of the plate, as the
slit in the blind starts to travel up it, a
fraction of time before the exposure at the
top of the plate begins and ceases. Evidence
of this defect is sometimes seen in instan-
taneous photographs of tennis players, where
the racquet striking appears to'have been
bent. What happened was that, as the
racquet was moving forward in a “smash,”
the top travelling much more quickly than
the handle, when the exposure of the handle
was made the racquet was perpendicular,
but by the time the slit of exposure had
moved to the top of the racquet, the top
had moved forward, leaving the impression
of the handle still upright, but recording
the later position of the top of the racquet.
The result is an apparently bent racquet.
Now. it should be possibly for a pho-
tographer, working with a slow travelling
slit that moved horizontally across the plate,
to catch in a man walking, or a horse gal-
loping, first the impression of the back foot,
or the hind legs, and on the same plate—
an • almost inappreciable fraction of a
second later—the impression of the new posi-
tion of the front foot, or the front legs—
a movement that had not taken place when
the impression of the rear part of the figure
was snapped. The thing is therefore theo-
retically possible, and the camera should be
able to reproduce not petrified movement
but the impression of movement actually
given by the eye and reproduced for us by
a sculptor like Rodin.

Adam Lindsay Gordon, and His Friends
in England and Australia, by Edith Hurn-
flhris and Douglas Sladen (Constable, per
Dymock’s, Sydney. 12s. (Jd.), turns out to
be very like Douglas Sladen. The preface
begins with this amazingly Sladisli asser-
tion : “At this moment every Australian, is
subscribing for a national monument to
Cordon, the poet of the Australian Bush” ;
and the first chapter Slades Gordon as “the
Byron of Australia.” Into this big and
well-illustrated book the editors have put
all that they know about Gordon and most
of what they don't know, the result being a
quite readable and very full biography, in-
terspersed with literary judgments that are
negligible. There is a chapter telling how
Gordon rode in Australia, a table of descent
of the Gordon family is given, the scene of
“How We Beat the Favorite” is described;
there is an account —so widely flung has
been the biographers’ net —of “Gordon’s
Lively Great-Grandmother,” and various de-
tails of the poet are related by his friends
and relatives. Worth reading, but not for
its literary judgments.
But the best appreciation is that con-
tained in Frank Maldon Robb’s Poems of
Adam Lindsay Gordon, in the Oxford Edi-
tion of standard poets (2s.). This is, in-
deed, a worthy tribute to the best-known
Australian poet. Of course, the book in-
cludes too many of Gordon’s lesser verses,
and perpetuates the vapidness of “Ash-
taroth” by republication in full, despite the
editor’s judgment that: “The whole poem is
a mistake, and very crudely written.”
Frank Maldon Robb, a Melbourne barris-
ter, has done his work sincerely and well ;
his criticism never genufiexes into Sladish
worship; and in the end he explains the
high place still allotted to Gordon by Aus-
tralia w due rather to the love Australians
bear him than to their critical appreciation.
“We in Australia read Gordon; we do
not pedestal him into the highest, or even
into a very high place; we love him and his
verse; and love is given to a man and a
poet and a book, not: for the things that the
world knows and names, but for the ‘novel
lights and darks undreamed of,’ and for
‘that which the world’s coarse thumb and
finger failed to plumb.’ You cannot explain
or analyse or weigh or ticket such love,”
In his account of “The Making, of Gor-
don” Robb applauds the critical dictum that
“he owed more to Byron and Browning,
Tennyson and Swinburne, than to Aus-
tralia or to anything Australian,” and ex-
amines critically these sources of inspira-
tion. The reader will find much that is in
agreement with the recent “Red Page” analy-
sis of Gordon’s work —statements like these :
“Gordon has no reliable sense of rhythm—
not much of rime; one can never be sure,
even in his most careful, conscientious arid
ambitious work, that his ear and taste will
not play him false. He is 'apt to drop
straight from the stars into the puddles.
His exceedingly limited and narrow range of
metres ineaps a' correspondingly nayrow
range of thought and emotion, and techni-
cally his verse is full of unpardonable and
mortal weaknesses.” “To the influence of
Browning. Australia—which loves the jing-
ling rimes, the living pictures, the rough-
hewn language of Gordon, while its predilec-
tion for Browning- is, to say the least, some-
what masked—owes more than it thinks.”
In this respect Robb notes the fact that the
titles of Gordon’s poems are singularlv
Browningesque, that in Gordon’s language
the resemblance is still more noteworthy,
that the subjects on which they love best to.
write prove them still more akin, and that:
‘The real affinity between them lies much
deeper than either their common language or
their common choice of subjects. Gordon has
derived from Browning habits of thought,
tastes, tendencies, moral and spiritual out-
looks, which have left their indelible and re-
vealing marks on tfll his verse.”
But the one became an optimist, the
other a pessimist. “Had Gordon learnt but
one more lesson from the great Teacher at
whose feet he had so often sat. there would
have been, no suicifle at Brighton Beach : and
the whole tone of the immediately succeeding
generation of Australian poets might have
been different.”
But in the section dealing with Gordon’s
debt to Australia. Robb makes the best of
what is left of the derivative Gordon —of
what Australia, which “in 1853 was one
huge inspiration,” did for the plastic and
impressionable youth.
This edition, at its cheap two ‘shillings,
remains the best to date. At five shillings,
however, there is T. N. Foulis’ fine Poems
of A'dam Lindsay Gordon, without preface
or biography, and illustrated in color, from
paintings by Cantain G. D. Giles. This has
the advantage of excluding “Ashtaroth.”

Fiction
■'There was Fleurette. That wasn’t her
real name—it was Marie-Josephine; but
people called her Fleurette. She looked like
a llower, you know. The most delicate
little flower you can conceive. Tiens, she
was a slender lily—so white, .and her hair
the flash of gold on it —and she had eyes—
aes yeux de pervenche, as we say in French.
hat is pervenche in English—that little
pale-blue flower?”
“Periwinkle*” said I.
“Periwinkle eyes! My God ! what a lan-
guage ! Ah, no! She had dets yetix de
pervenche... .She was didphune. diaphanous
.. . .impalpable as cigarette-smoke.. .a little
nose like nothing at all, with nostrils like
infinitesimal sea-sliells. Anyone could have
made a mouthful of her....l’ve never told
you about Fleurette. It was this way.”
No need to tell the name of the author to
the ' novel - soaked subscription library
habitue ; it is .plainly William J. Locke on
the sea-coast of Bohemia, with another be-
loved vagabond adventuring among women’s
hearts. This time it is The Joyous Adven-
tures of Aristide Pujol (Lane, per Dymock,
Sydney) ; and with such a hero one need be
disappointed neither in the adventures nor,
in their joyousness. In these slight stories,'
evidently written for magazine consumption,
Locke, whose workings seemed to 1 wheeze
with overwork in Clementina Winy, has re-
gained his old careless gaiety. There are
delightful touches in Locke’s old manner,
and his style is still a thing of charm.
The light handling, the tender pathos, the
bubbling humor makes this slight thing worth
more than Locke’s later more serious novels.
The Keynote, translated under this title
from Monsieur dcs Sourdines, by Alphonse
de Chateaubriaut (Hodder and Stoughton),
comes to us garlanded with the laurels of
the French literature, for to this author the
annual Goneourt prize was awarded. The
novel has a stylistic resemblance to Marie
Claire, a novel similarly acclaimed. As the
translator says: “Its merit lies, not in live-
liness of plot, wealth of incident, or pander-
ing to the elemental passions, but in the
extraordinary delicacy of its appeal to the
best and purest side of human nature.” It
is the plain story of the ruin that falls upon
a rich recluse by his decision to pay off the
accumulated debts of his spendthrift son,
rather than let that useless youth -go to
prison, and of the final reconciliation be-
tween father and repentant son] Beauti-
fully written, no doubt, but desperately dull.
The English reader cannot live on style
alone. These painstaking descriptions of
country life are as innocuous as butter-
scotch, and leave as lasting a memory.

(Constable, 10s. 6d.), ahd The Biq Booh of

Robinson (Blackie, 7s. Gd.). Each is a

really appreciates the line and composition,
the management of the blacks, the subtle

The Inky Way.
“Chuddah”: The London Times exults over No.
40,000. There is a kind of subterranean apology, an
undercurrent in the exultation— a sort of “You
know, it was impossible for us to remain as great
as we used to be.” Yet the Times ought to have
done so. Some trace the downfall to the Parnell-
Pigott case, in which Asquith developed as junior to
Russell; but that wasn’t it. What wrought the
downfall was the bribing of Sampson, the financial
editor. That broke the backbone, and got at the
spinal marrow. Sampson’s sister married Gabrielli,
the financier, and probably that helped Samnsoh to
fall into the hands of the Philistines. This Gab-
riclli visited Melbourne, by the way, having nego-
tiated a big loan in London for the Melbourne cor-
poration, which found itself stuck up for money in the
rapid development of population after the gold-
fields rush.
“Inkywaryun”: What is “Downward L ” (B
21 111 / 12) driving at / He starts by abusing Pitman-
ltes and sneering at our system, and ends by com-
mending it! Of course, all Pitmanites are bigoted,
as all devotees of anything that is best ought to be
f believe I am the oldest Pitmanite in Vic., having
got my certificate from old Izak in 1875. I have
tried some of the other shorthand systems, but still
use Pitman daily, because I find it to be the clearest
and the easiest to read. Plenty of stenographers
can write other systems more quicklv than I can use
Pitman; but they can’t read what thev have written
as quickly, and, in fact, sometimes they can’t read
it at all. Besides, for one shorthander who writes
any other svstem, there are 100 using old Izak's
phonetics. And, finally, with Pitman’s, tuition is not
necessarv. I taught mvself in 18 months with the
aid of the three original books. This par. is not meant
as the gift of a bunch of flowers to myself for clever-
ness, but is merely an illustration "of how really
scientific and accurate, and, therefore, how easily
acquired, used and remembered the old admirable
system is.
Another little stranger blew on to the Inky Way
the other morning—'Tiir Australian Journalist,
official organ of the A.J.A. It explains that it is
expected “to promoie tho.-e feelings of comradeship,
mutual interest and mutual reliance without which
it is almost impossible for such an association to
satisfactorily progress." It will breathe this into
tlie ears of the widely-scattered men who are buildiii"
up a national journalism for Australia, and generally
act as press agent of the hitherto unboomed news-
paper scribe. Subscribers to the Journalist can rest
assured that nowhere upon its pages will there appear
photographs of unmusical-comedy girls having earlv
tea (or maybe, beer) in bed. ' For this alone it
merits the respect of a long-suffering public.
* * * *
“Scribe”: With a long experience of the Inky
Way, I should describe the late Edward Ellis, who
has died in poverty in Melbourne Hospital (B.
5/12/’12), as the most truly unlucky member of the
profession. Winter, the old-time Czar of the local
Herald, said Ellis was the best journalist he had
employed. I thought he would have said it of
Walstab. In my view Walstab was a niche (which
does not imply much) above Ellis, who could only
surpass him in range. Of the two Walstab was the
brilliant, dashing Beau Sabreur, while Ellis had a
valuable London experience to start with, and, in
his day, that gave him some advantage over Austra-
lians. But nothing ever went quite right with him
for long, and. knowing him well, I can’t put it
down to anything but sheer ill-luck.
* * * *
“G.V.” : P. C. Freeth will, it is said, shortly wind
up his second term as editor of the Times, Welling-
ton (M.L.), and will thereafter earn a crust manag-
ing the Daily Times at Taihape—a main trunk
village, with glorious memories of malt and hops,
two-up and draw-poker. The Times is an uneasy
paper; in these latter days a large amount of its
energy and space is taken up in running advertising
competitions.
INK OR WATER?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There's a dissipated rhyth-m in the rattle ot the rain
(Of course no sober rhythm could be quite dis-
syllable) ;
As I sit and suffer silently, it’s washing down the
pane,
From a glass that seems inordinately spillable.
Oh, my rhymes are slopping over, as they always
seem to do,
For the wind is in the trees, and won’t be quiet:
And the song they will be singing
In my silly head is ringing,
And the sense from the rhyme is running riot;
Or perhaps it’s running through,
As the wind and water do,
Through the sylvan pipes of Pan or hamadryad.'
There are songs that sing themselves '
When the sibilating elves
Rustle round and make a noise among the herbage.
You may try to make them fit,
But you'll find it isn’t it,
When you’ve got them scribbled down in scrambled
verb’age.
You may listen how you will,
While their thrummings through you thrill,
Bike -Bolus a-hymning through a grater;
But, endeavor to translate
Them to words, you’ll find that fate
Reaches bottom, by translating the translater.
You will hem and ha and hum,
Strike a string, and find it dumb,
Beat your brain-box like a gong, and make a mortar
Of the thing you call your soul;
Then you’ll watch the rain-drops roll,
And conclude you'd better write your ode in water.
WAIF.
AN OPEN LETTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear Constant Reader, —Glad I am
To know you’re still a-reading ;
And still, I hope, the family pram
Holds infants gaily feeding;
Your worthy lady, Ma of Ten,
May all good luck delight her 1
You’ve helped me long, you best of men,
For I am Constant Writer.
No squeamish taste is yours, dear Con. ;
The pen may not be flowing,
But page on page you look upon,
And evermore keep going;
Yciu read the best, you read the worst,
You read the in-between things,
And at the last as at the first
You seem to think they mean things.
And if one tires, a little time,
Nor scales the high intention,
You still reward the prose or rhyme
With kindly look and mention ;
For niggling blame you do not stay,
Nor show pretended sorrow:
You know we did well yesterday.
And hope we shall to-morrow.
So, Constant Reader, you’re the man
I like to have a-reading;
For ever may your worthy clan
A peaceful life be leading ;
Of flowering or of budding pen
You’ve never been a blighter,
So flourish on, you best of men.
—Yours truly, Constant Writer.

SHE KNOWS
that the installation of a gas service means the saving of an untold amount of
work and worry, and, more than anyone else, realises the benefits of having
a gas stove and bath-heater always ready to help her through the continuous
round of household duties.
The Immense Saving Effected by
QUIRK’S AIR CAS
is alone a very important factor, for it is far cheaper than any known lighting
agent, while —being non-explosive and non-poisonous—there is no need to be
constantly on one’s guard against accidents.
THE SIMPLICITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MACHINE
assures reliability, and obviates the necessity of any skilled attendance.
The Company send their own Experts to install the system, and no payment
is asked until the Customer gives his certificate as to satisfactory service.

TOO THIN
WOMEN.
If you are flat-
chested, thin,
run down and
scraggly—even if you never had a
nicely-rounded bosom, Dr. Fai-
lure's Flesh-Food will build you
up and develop your figure. Does
your mirror mock you? Flesh-
Food will remove the faults in
your figure by rounding out and
developing the deficient places.
Put up in Tablet form, it is easy
to use and pleasant to take, and,
if desired, may be taken secretly.
Taken under our directions, it
will work wonders for your ap-
pearance. Thousands of grateful
women fully endorse it.
In many cases bust measure-
ments have been increased by
over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other
cases have shown an increase in
weight of even a pound a day.
The average bust increase desired
is about six inches, and is readily
accomplished. Results invariably guaranteed.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development to
the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve, and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women.
TOO FAT
PEOPLE.
Excess fat in-
jures your
health, impedes
your movements, and makes you
the butt of your unfeeling nor-
mal-weight friends. People who
have been fat, and are now re-
duced to normal, think other
fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat in-
jure your healtli and endanger
your existence, it absolutely
destroys your figure and makes
you a’ ludicrous sight. Why do
you stay fat? “FATCURE
positively removes excess fat,
and will restore your spoiled
figure to decent and pleasing
proportions, and is always a
sure and lasting cure for obesity
and corpulency. A few doses
improves your breathing won-
derfully, and the course of treat-
ment will cure you.
It is the onlv successful, and.
at the same time, harmless, that
has ever been discovered. Tts ., h ‘ f b c _
undeniably demonstrated in thousands ot sue
cess™ treated cases. It is totally and abso-
lutely non-poisonous, and can in no wue 'vovk
any injur}' to the general health; though it
often reduces excess weight by as much as a
pound a day. You should try it at once.

An Island Statue.
Out there on Gabo, rock-ribbed and severe,
’Mid rush and tumult of opposing seas,
His noble image be it ours to rear
There on yon outpost isle that knows no
trees;
There at the Cape, “the parting of the
ways.”
Within his ken all ships that, toiling,
pass, .
Bound East or West, till merged in mist and
haze,
Or lost in vapors ’neath a sky of brass.
Ships from the North and West, whose
prows of steel .
At his firm-planted feet shall rise and dip
In salutation, ere they turn to wheel
Or West or North in passing, ship by ship.
There, at the wide-flung portal of the
Straits, . , ,
Whose crested rollers, hoarse with loud
acclaim
In sea-born thunder, rushing to their fates.
Pronounce to sea and shore his honored
name.
More fitting pedestal, O lonely isle.
Than thou there is not in Australian seas.
More meet than is for Memnon on the Nile,
The rock whereon he sits, with hands on
knees.
Here, from thy crest, the hero shall explore
Scenes of rude labor passed, of battles
fought
At odds, with wind and wave, ’tween shore
and shore,
Of days and darkness with, adventure
fraught.
’Tis his alone, O grey and surge-swept isle,
To crown thy height; and all the ships
that pass,
Or by thy lantern’s light or Day-dawn s
smile,
Breasting the wave, shall bless the ardent
Bass.
Bass, who stands sentinel beside the Gates
He found and forced; as, riding on the
tide, ,
He gave the world the highway of the
Straits, . .
And, radiant, flung those azure portals
wide.
On Gabo be it, then, our bronze to rear.
Lesseps by the Canal has pride of place,
Scanning the work that makes his title
clear.
But Bass on Gabo wears another grace.

Rest.
Give me a book from which I may distil a
little rest *
A book of grave smooth-flowing prose I think
would be the best;
And if it deals with ancient things forgot
and put away, , , „
Then I will treasure it the more and gladly
for it pay.
This is a fevered age wherein good rest is
hard to find; ,
Unrestful people rush before and shove like
fiends behind;
And ev’ry job makes work. It seems as if
we’d all conspired
To toil and wear ourselves right out at
making people tired.
Who makes or manufactures rest? Who
sells the only thing
That people ever really want? I hear a
shop-bell ring,
And some sleep-thickened voice cry “Shop !”
with one reluctant breath.
The coin rings on a coffin lid ! The Voice
again : “Shop, Death !”

The Feather.
Barby came down with a brown floating
feather
In her dark hair.
Under the trees in the sweet-scented weather
Life was most fair. Barby came there.
Western winds, laden with wattle-sweet,
stooped her
Tresses to touch.
(Who would suppose that a shining brown
feather mattered so much?)
Roaming alone in the grey winter weather,
Where the winds fret,
In the sere branches I found a worn feather,
Broken and wet. (Could I forget?)
Cold o’ the wind, will ye ask the storm
whether
It knew the fine touch?
(Who would suppose that a wet, broken
feather mattered.... so much ?)

Earth.
Green grows my grave in the grass,
Somewhere. ... ? Oh, let it be
Here in the land that I love,
My heart’s own Italy.
The bee will hum to the bud,
And the bud will whisper to me 1
Of the dawn and the dew and the flood
And the season’s mystery.
The song of the brook through the stones,
The song of the thrush through the tree,
Will mingle and marry and hush
With the music of moonlight and sea.
And mad with their musical chant
I know that my heaven will be
To go through the wild olden wood
Of earth-sweet memory.

Lorries is at least four times the speed of horse-traction. This not alone means
rapid deliveries, to the pleasing of customers and the convenience of the mer-

Remember that, if you increase the radius of your business by half—say
from 10 up to 15 miles —you do not only increase the area of the business
field by half, also, YOU MORE THAN DOUBLE IT ! Verify this statement
by figures. And then investigate what the “COMMER” offers you in in-
creased trade and range.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/' is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to ver-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

COMPULSORY TRAINING, AND THE
FOOLS AND TRAITORS WHO ARE
HAMPERING IT.
Last week the news came by cable that
Keik Haedie, the posturer who makes a
speciality of advocating every lost, not to
say demented, cause that is going, had
started a fund in the United Kingdom to
fight the compulsory clauses of the Austra-
lian Defence Act —just as though some Cen-
tral African savage had inaugurated a move-
ment in his tribe to abolish early closing in
Albury or Bourke. It was stated, in the
same message, that a Keir Haedie emis-
sary was already at work in the Common-
wealth addressing meetings and organising
societies in opposition to the Act. The im-
pertinences of these outsiders are not likely
in themselves to injure the Defence move-
ment to any great extent. Unfortunately,
however, their uncalled-for efforts are
warmly aided by the local Peace Society
enthusiasts, in whose ranks are to be found
not merely the local anarchists, but num-
bers of normally law-abiding and rational
citizens. For example, the Rev. Professor
Macintyre, of Sydney, spread himself, the
other day, on the question, in a manner that
doubtless caused the wild-eyed revolution-
aries who regard Patriotism' as an offence
against democracy, to leap with joy. After
denouncing every form of military service
as immoral and opposed to the tenets of
Christianity and brotherly feeling, he hedged
to this extent: —
If Australia was gratuitously attacked, he did not
suppose any member of the society would consider
himself outside his rights in defending it.
It is a point of view that has been taken bv
two classes of undesirables —viz., fools and
traitors—since the dawn of history.
The pacificist who is not a congenital vil-
lain, who would hate to see his country
seized by a foreigner amidst scenes of carn-
age and rapine, and who is sufficiently
proud of it to recoil at the thought of it
being trailed in the gory mud of defeat be-
fore the eyes of the world, buttresses his
case by two forms of special pleading, both
of them glaringly fallacious enough to arouse
the scorn of an intelligent aborigine. The
first is to the effect that if Australia, or auy
other nation, refrains from annoying its
neighbors by a display of militarism, and
remains defenceless and civil and obliging,
the latter will be so edified that they will
not harm it. Despite the recent horrible
example of the Koreans (about the most
humble, inoffensive and ill-armed people on
record) and of a dozen others that might
be cited, these queer logicians continue to
claim that the one requisite for national
safety is the absence of an army and a navy.
Deny yourself the fierce delight of paying
for battleships and the maintenance of
troops, they say in effect, and your banks
and shops and businesses will be safe for
all time. Remain weak and no one will
ever think of forcibly settling on your fer-
tile lands or violently occupying your vast
coastal cities. By the simple and inexpen-
sive process of basking unobtrusively in the
sun you will avoid the fate of Assyria,
Rome, Byzantium, Carthage, Babylon,
Macedonia, and all the other Empires whose
remains are strewn along the path of Time.
This type of controversialist is fully cap-
able of propounding the theory that the
Aztec Empire might have been saved by a
policy of friendly inertia. Let it be men-
tioned to him that accidents and rows and
occasionally violent hatreds occur in the best
regulated families ; that it is the unexpected
which happens, more especially in interna-
tional affairs; that, in fact, war is always
a possibility even where it isn’t a pro-
bability, and he so far yields, like Pro-
fessor Macintyre did a few days ago, as to
use the second string to the Peace bow. It
amounts to this. Assuming the ravening
foe has arrived and is shelling the cities
and _ towns; laying waste the landscape:
blowing up bridges; “commandeering”
clothing, provisions and so on; and in
general raising particular Sheol, in accord-
ance with the time-honored traditions of
warfare, then and not till then is it permis-
sible for the convinced anti-Defencite to rise
up in pained surprise and do something.
Having no arms, nor any knowledge of how
to use them if he had, it is difficult to see
just how he would contrive to beat off the
enemy. The deadliest weapon in the armory
of a clerical member of a Peace Society
would probably be his umbrella. Yet, as a
means of warding off a bayonet thrust,
directed by a trained hand, it is safe to lay
it down that an umbrella would be the rot-
tenest of failures.
* * * *
The International Socialist, or Industrial
Worker of the World—-he who believes in
the brotherhood of man, and communism,
and the abrogation of all laws, and the effi-
cacy of red ties and whiskers and dirt and
blither—sees eye to eye with the Peace
Society crank, as regards the merits of anti-
defence, in every respect but one. He does
not believe in so much as shaking a hostile
umbrella at the invader. His attitude is
that everything should belong to everybody,
more particularly to the Industrial Workers
of the World. So lons as it doesn’t, he is
indifferent whether he is governed by Japs,
Chinese or Australians. Accordingly, if
any foreigner, white, black or brown, fancies
the Commonwealth, he is in favor of handing
it over without protest or other unpleasant-
ness. Pride of race—the sentiment which
causes white men to kick violently at the
idea of being dominated by Asiatics —is no
part of his philosophy of life. Nor is regard
for the honor of his women kind. Appar-
ently he is even unable to see that existence
would be considerably harsher for him per-
sonally if the Commonwealth were occupied
by (say) Japanese. He is, of course, as
averse to military training as Professor
Macintyre, or any of his associates; and
day by day and year by year, he consistently
does his little best to hamper the Defence
movement. So far, he has been a somewhat
futile obstructionist, owing in part to his
scarcity in point of numbers, in part to the
wild unreasonableness of his attitude. But
since it is not in human nature for a people
which has never had its nerves shaken by
personal experience of warfare, to rejoice at
the hard, dull work that is bound up with
drill and so on ; and since, furthermore, taxa-
tion (and more especially Defence taxation,
which yields no visible return in the way
of roads, bridges, etc) is necessarily irk-
some to the multitude, many thousands con-
ceive a sneaking affection for his tenets. On
the extremely ancient principle that men be-
lieve most readily what they want to believe,
there is a fairly widespread inclination to
support the policy of the International So-
cialists with the arguments of the_ dreamy
individuals who drift into Peace Societies.
Thus it is that persons who are ordinarily
patriotic, and who, in any case, have every-
thing to lose by a successful foreign invasion,
are to be found everywhere contending that
perhaps, after all. the Defence business is
being overdone. They point out that trouble
is unlikely; that the Defence bill of a
modern nation is a hideously large affair;
and that, in any case, Australians are good
natural fighters, and so can dispense with
many of the war preliminaries that may be
essential in the case of their inferiors.
Summed up, these folks don’t advocate no
Defence, so much as less Defence, and in
this respect, for lack of a more definite
pronouncement, they have all the irreconcil-
ables with them.
It will be a bleak day for Australia if the
combined efforts of its traitors, fools and
loafers succeed to the extent of putting any-
thing like a serious check on its perilously
belated Defence movement. Russia lost
Manchuria, Port Arthur, the Kwanglung
Peninsula, and half of Saghalien, seven years
ago, and was forced to recognise Japan’s
sphere of influence in Korea, not because
it was poor, not because its troops lacked
the courage they have always shown, but
because its preparations for war were as
casual as its yellow enemy’s were careful
and complete. Events had been inevitably
leading up to the Russo-Jap trouble ever
since the Saghalien incident of 1875. Dur-
ing over 30 years the Japanese army in-
creased steadily in size and efficiency. In
the same period a navy of a high order came
into being. Meanwhile Russia drifted. In
1903 the Czar’s vast Empire was hopelessly
unprepared for a conflict of any importance.
By all the rules of the game, as laid down
by the Peace Society people, Japan should
have held off and done nothing in face of
such monumental inoffensiveness. In point
of fact, it eagerly seized this particular mo-
ment to get busy. There is no need to
recapitulate what happened. Russian naval
officers of all ranks knew what was in store
for them from the first. The Port Arthur
squadron was forbidden to put to sea by
Admiral Alexeiev at the very beginning of
the war, and Semenov mentions that in the
Vladivostock Squadron all but the most be-
sottedly ignorant appreciated that their first
encounter with Kamimuka’s cruisers meant
certain death. Russia, as a result of its
partial reliance on Peace Society principles,
may be said to have been beaten before the
fighting began. Spain lost practically the
last of its colonial possessions the other day,
owing to the same cause. The effete old
nation had battleships enough, and its sailors
were brave, but the former were out of date
and the latter were untrained, and carnage
and overthrow followed automatically. If
there is one respect in which history repeats
itself with more deadly monotony than an-
other, it is in the matter of the fate of the
unprepared nations. Not one of them but
has had to face its Calvary. The Turkish
soldiers are going through the immemorial
agony at the present moment, because for a
decade or more it has been no one’s business
in particular to train and clothe them, to
see that proper commissariat and hospital
arrangements were made, and to nrovide
them with modern weapons of precision. A
German officer with the Turkish army pays
a tribute to the daring of the rank and file in
the London Daily News (9/11/M2). But
he points out that the Ottoman troops never
had a hope of success. One reason was “the
overwhelming superiority of the Bulgarian
guns to those used by the Turks.” The
highly modern Creusot weapons used by the
Bulgars were irresistible. _ _ Also, the Turks
were starving, the ammunition was defective,
and their artillery was badly served, so much
so that “many of the guns came out of
action with, the covers still on, and as clean
as they went in.” It is a grim tale of laissez-
faire and resultant inefficiency, leading up
to a colossal tragedy—-the sort of tale the t
is always told of a nation when it slackens
up in the race of armaments. Just as
in the ordinary walks of life, so in the
great gamble of war, those who are to
have a sporting chance must be schooled
and organised to the last unit. Half-
measures are well-nigh as disastrous as none
at all. The officers must know their jobs
as familiarly as competent barristers know
the procedure of the Courts; the men must
be so disciplined by ceaseless handling that
they will be ready to attempt the forlornest
of hopes; and there must be efficiency every-
where, from boots to battleships.
THE WHEEL AND THE HOLIDAY.
Men of science have conjectured of the sun
that in addition to revolving in the midst of
its flaming whiskers, it is travelling some-
where on its own account, dragging its
planets, comets, asteroids, moons and other
encumbrances to some possible goal utterly
beyond the limit of research or observation.
It is just possible that the world of trams,
breakfasts, oysters, smiles, beer, newspapers
and policemen is doing the same thing, and
that eventually it will really get somewhere
and afford politicians an opportunity of
congratulating everybody on the success of
evolution. On the face of things, however,
this doesn’t seem very probable. The ear-
liest artists of Egypt sketched things much
as Nokman Lindsay does, the last king of
Babylon devoted his life to reading and
translating the inscriptions on ancient tombs
and monuments, the lake dwellers of 15,000
b.c. had skulls the shape of our own, and
doubtless persons in Memphis and Tyre had
to run for the boat and pay cab-hire just as
we do to-day. As a plain fact, Babylon was
a finer city than New York, Alexandria
only lacked a picturesque harbor to make it
better than Sydney as a place of residence,
and, at its best, Thebes, with its 30 miles
of granite temples and palaces, would have
made London look like a cluster of tempor-
ary humpies. Yet the wheel of the world
is turning steadily, and our splendid modern
achievements fill us with a hope that in a
century or two we may come within range
of some of the heights attained in ages that
are gone. This may be good business or the
reverse. Happiness may lie at the bottom
of the revolution or at the top ; but our own
view of the wheel’s rotation is apt to be a
sordid and personal one. The hunt for com-
mon, necessary bread-and-butter goes in a
circle; and the ancient law which lays it
down that you can’t have your cake and eat
it too keeps a considerable number of us
steadily on the run. No sooner have we got
the loaf of our desire than the urgent need
of the pat of butter forces itself upon us,
and when by speed and dexterity we lay
hands on that also, we are suddenly made
aware that the baker’s product is already
demolished and that another bun or roll must
be snared on which to spread the otherwise
useless product of the dairy. So the business
goes on and on, with monotonous regularity,
until the thing gets upon our nerves and we
want to break away, or smash each separate
one of the Ten Commandments, or run amok
across the crowded avenues of civilisation,
not because we really wish to harm or de-
stroy anything, but simply because our
nerves are out of order.
Very large numbers of people, particu-
larly in this favored Australia, never suffer
in this way; but when they do, doc-
tors usually recommend change. Instead of
adding up figures, or trying to sell houses
or float mines or write poems or wash clothes
or burgle houses, they advise us to get away
into the country and live like the sheep or
the tomato until we are sufficiently braced
up to go back to our place on the wheel. If
we can follow the advice in a regular sort
of way, so much the better. Week-ends m
the bush and the like may be part of the
wheel; but as long as we don’t notice that
they are, the benefit is just the same. The
slow, brutal, spider-like pastime of fishing
is useful for degraded persons in whom the
primal savage instincts have been merely
held in check by the outward forces of re-
ligion. Shooting live creatures for the mere
joy of base and treacherous murder may
help others to get back their lost power to
endure their normal fate. To persons of
higher ethical stature and nobler moral
growth, it is enough to sit with Cissy under
a gum tree while the breezes play hide-and-
seek in the errant tresses that have been
kissed into living gold by peroxide, and the
red lips assist the sweetly feminine system
to absorb delicacies in the midst of the sun-
glad wilderness. According to Byron,
“Each beast has his nature —a king’s is to
reign.” There is something kingly about
the splendid sloth that can bask in sunshine
and idleness and be happy about it. But
whatever form the relaxation may take, the
great thing is to get away from the wheel,
or what is just as good, seem to get away
from it. This is the philosophy of holidays.
Human evolution, ground out on the wheel
of the Potter, or the Boss Diamond Cutter,
or whoever it is that shapes our ends, runs
so close; to the thing men call insanity that
a break is absolutely necessary, and life —
the real life that counts to the individual—
is the part of existence spent outside the in-
fluence of the everlasting revolutions.
Australia is, above all places on this
planet, the land of the holiday. One of its
most popular bards has said that “it is the
land o’ lots o’ time along the Castlereagh.”
The lots are equally numerous in other
districts. At Christmas time other peoples
try to shake themselves loose from their
shackles, and have what they regard as a
good time. Australia has a good time, or it
is its own fault if it doesn’t. The sun does
its best; bush, sea and sky join in the
glad conspiracy; and if the human element
in the proposition doesn’t come up to the
scratch, it is entirely its own fault. Europe
crouches round a big fire and eats heavy
substances difficult of digestion, until a
weighty merriment is produced which it has
the courage to label joy. Australia can
beat that sort of thing out of sight, and
there is a new note of gaiety in its laughter,
clean and unfettered as the surf rolling in.
or the brown limbs of the nymphs that tumble
in the breakers.
And it is just there that the troubles of
this big island mostly come in. It is so
good a place for getting glad that, with a
huge section of the people, life is all tangent
and no circle. The sun is so bright, and
the tangles of hair so numerous
that men find it difficult to take the old
wheel of life seriously. That it must go
round and that somebody must supply the
motive power is evident, but the weather is
altogether too pleasant to seriously tackle the
question as to who should get busy about
the job. When bread-and-butter is urgently
needed, and the quarry is in sight, someone
will get up and chase it to its lair. In fact,
most people will take at least a lansruid
interest in the hunt. But the pursuit is
mainly urged with a view to more holidays
when the immediate necessity is past, or to
getting rid of the animal once for all in a
grand battue which may make it possible
for the retired hunter to sit in the sun, or
the motor-car, or the corner of the pub, as
happy and idle as a pagan deity or a Chris-
tian cauliflower. This is the chief reason
why things are not done. Our politics and
big national concerns conflict with the holi-
day idea, and can only get forward in a
holiday spirit. There is the matter of a
White Australia, of an army and fleet to
defend it, of straight railways of uniform
gauge to make that defence possible, of popu-
lating the rich country that lies most open
to occupation by a possible enemy, of secur-
ing a better distribution of population in the
more closely settled States, by opening up
new ports, of limiting the possibilities of
commercial plunder, of safeguarding indus-
tries and those engaged in them by increased
tariff duties, and of lightening and improv-
ing the machinery of government by the abo-
lition of Upper Houses, State Governors and
other non-ornamental encumbrances. All
these matters have points about them that
are urgent and want attending to without
delay. Even the national picnic cannot well
be maintained if they are longer neglected.
But the sun is warm ; the gum leaves turn-
ing up to let the light fall through are en-
ticing ; and—let the confounded things
wait. The Roman Saturnalia was properly
of two to five days’ duration : Roman prac-
tice made it last for seven. The Australian
political Christmas holiday may officially
last for a week or six weeks : in practice it
seems to extend over 52. Who cares ? As
long as there is beer for John Smith and
ice-cream for his daughter Cissy, and a
sunny place to get warm and a shady place
to get cool, why worry about the fact that
the machine of politics seems wobbling to a
stand-still? Some enthusiastic Asiatic may
yet make the old wheel spin again, and John
and Ctssy may be underneath! But such
a possibility is quite outside the realm of
the practical. It can’t possibly hapnen before
next week! So, again, in the language of
the man at the “What’s the
hurry ?’
A ROYAL COMMISSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sit you down, discerning brother, let us un~
derstand each other.
And push forward with a little scheme
apace.
It concerns our Constitution and the “threat-
ened revolution,”
As the heated Tory quaintly puts the case.
It concerns these referenda and how far we
ought to go.
And the very vital question: Are we voting
Yes or No?
You are sick, as I am, brother, and indeea
full many other
Men of sense and perspicacity (like us)—
Sick of ev’ry quin and quibble, and the parti
cries that dribble


From the politicians; sick of all the fuss,
Of debates that lead to nowhere, and the
howls of mock distress,
And the most transparent blather of a very
biassed press.
Wherefore, friend, with your permission, let
us form a small commission.
Just a very small and quite select affair.
You and I alone comprise it; if no others
recognise it
We can let it go at that. Why should we
care?
'Tis a matter that concerns, in brief, the
votes of you and me;
Bo we'll waste no time in fretting if some
others don't agree.
We’ll assume, as time is flitting, our com-
mission now is sitting.
It comprises two plain men of common
sense;
And, though others may ignore us, we shall
iveigh the facts before us
And report correctly on the evidence.
Our first witness is the man of whom the
daily papers bleat —
He's the “average elector" or the “person in
the street."
Takethbookinyerrightand Thevi-
dence... . Selpyer... .Kissthbook.
“You represent the average elector?”
“I do.”
“Are you in favor of any alterations in
the Federal Constitution?”
“Well, you see, I haven’t quite made up
me mind. There’s one bloke says”
“Never mind what people say. Have
you thoroughly considered these Constitu-
tional questions?”
“I got me job to look after.”
“Do you believe in the regulation of in-
jurious Trusts?”
“My oath!”
“Well, do you think that these proposals
will help to regulate Trusts?”
“I dunno. The Mornin’ Megaphone
says”
“Never mind what the papers say. ; Do
you believe all you read in the papers?”
“Not much! But, then, the member for
Mud Flat says”
“Do you believe all the politicians tell
you?”
“No fear!”
“How do you propose to come to a deci-
sion?”
“It’s a fair cow, ain’t it?”
“Yes, but you have to make up your
mind, you know. Do you favor unifica-
tion?”
“I dunno.”
“Do you favor State Rights?”
“My oath!”
“Do you uphold Legislative Councils, the
Property Vote and Government by the
Wealthy?”
“No blanky fear!"
“You believe in government by the
people?”
“You bet!”
“If you don’t believe in these other things
why don’t you abolish them?”
“You’re pullin’ me leg.”
“You have the power.”
“Aw, dicken!”
“The witness may stand down.”
You'll observe, my learned brother, that this
man, like many other
Fellows of his type, is in a perfect maze —
What with politicians’ capers and the
wrangling of the papers,
This way and that he oscillates and sways.
He doesn’t know which way he'll vote,
though vote he feels he must.
For our next witness let us have the Spirit
of the Trust.
Takethebook. . . .Trootholetrooth
Kissthebook.
“You represent the Trust or Combine?”
“Yes.”
“With regard to these referenda ques-
tions; do you?”
“It is a deliberate attempt to wreck the
established form of government and inter-
fere unduly with Private Enterprise!”
“What do you suggest should?”
“We only ask to be let alone.”
“What were your profits for the?”
“I refuse to answer.”
“What capital?”——
“I refuse to answer.”
“Did you, last year, subscribe to the funds
of the party that is fighting these amend-
ments ?”
“I refuse to answer.”
“Is it a fact that you subscribed
£500,000,000?”
“I give that statement an absolute and
unqualified denial!”
“What sum did you subscribe?”
“I refuse to answer. Let us alone.”
“But why should the Trusts fear?”
“There are no Trusts in Australia.”
“But you said just now that you repre-
sented the Trusts?”
“I wish to amend my reply. There are
no Trusts in Australia!"
“The witness may stand down.”
I regret that our commission, friend, is not
in a position
To compel replies more definite than his.
Since he’s chary of revealing facts, there’s
something he’s concealing ;
But we’ll weigh his evidence just as it is.
'Tis said that money talks, but when it suits
it can be dense. .
The Spirit of Democracy will now give evi-
dence.
.... Tholetrooth. . . . Selpyer. . . . Kiss-
thbook.
“You represent the Democratic Spirit?”
“I do.”
“Do you favor the extension of national
power ?”
“Why should I not? Is it undemocratic
to trust the people?”
“The Federal legislators might misuse
these powers?”
“They are controlled by the people.”
“But why rob the States of their rights?”
“The States possess no rights that the
people do not possess.”
“Or privileges?”
“It is a section —a small section —of the
people who are privileged through the ex-
istence of Houses of Property.”
“The Legislative Councils?”
“Yes.”
“But are not these controlled by the
people?”
“By only a privileged section.”
“Then the extension of Federal power
would help to break the power of privilege?”
“Undoubtedly. It would be taking the
power away from the privileged and placing
it with the people.” .
“One moment, though. Are not Legisla-
tive Councillors wiser and freer from pre-
judice than the people’s representatives?”
“You will have your little joke!”
“The witness may retire.”
Now, good friend, a light is breaking while
this evidence we're taking,
For this witness does not hesitate or
hedge.
Judging by his answers solely, it appears
the issue wholly
Rests between the People's Rights and
Privilege.
But let us hear the other side and ponder
that reply.
The Honorable Toryphat will forthwith
testify.
.... Bookinyerightand. . . . Selpyer. . . .
Kissthbook.
“You represent Wealth, Privilege and the
Reactionary Spirit?”
“I have that honor.”
“But not necessarily Intellect or Wis-
dom ?”
“Pardon me. To become wealthy one
must necessarily be intelligent; and the man
who has made a success of his own business
is best fitted to look after the business of his
country.”
“To the detriment of his own business?”
“I don’t see what that has to do with it.”
“You do not believe in any extension of
Federal powers?”
“Most emphatically no! The Labor party
with these powers”
“Then you think the Labor party will re-
tain office?”
“Certainly not! Our party has every
chance of beating them next elections.”
“Then why object to putting these powers
into the hands of your own party?”
“While there is the remotest chance of
Labor ever getting back again, it is unsafe.”
“Then you would extend the power
of the Federal Parliament?”
‘'Never! It is unsafe.”
“Each of the States has a ‘safe’ House?”
“Thank Heaven!”
'“What do you mean by a ‘safe’ House?”
“I mean a House that will always vote as
we wish it to, and will not brook any undue
interference with Private Enterprise and
the rights of the better classes.”
“So, when you speak of States Rights
you really mean the rights of the Legislative
Councils —the right of Capital to veto legis-
lation ?”
“Put it that way if you like.”
“And the question fines itself down to
this: Federal rights are the unqualified
rights of the people; State rights are also
the rights of the people—the same people—
qualified by the privileges of the Legislative
Councils; and the forthcoming fight will
really mean, the Legislative Councils versus
the people?”
“Perhaps. But the people will never per-
ceive the real issue."
“The people are not fools?”
“My dear sir, the people are fools; and
there are ways of persuading them. I have
said there are some smart men in our party.
Also, there are the newspapers.”
“You mean to cloud the issue?”
“Why not? Our cause is just.”
“The witness may stand down.”
Report :
On the evidence before it —though some part
was apt to bore it —
This Commission now reports to those
concerned:
It has come to the conclusion that State
Rights are an illusion;
And amid the crowd there's much to be
unlearned.
That some may disagree with it 'tis ready
to confess.
As for itself, its vote will be a very solid
“Yes."

The Failure of the Party Machine.
After a reasonable trial in N. S. Wales,
organised Labor has not succeeded in carry-
ing the measures set forth on its platform,
has not succeeded in making good in the
eyes of the general public, and has not
broken the power of the forces arrayed
against it. On the contrary, its represen-
tatives in Parliament have conducted the
affairs of the State very much after the
fashion of other party representatives who
went before them, and the community does
not appear to have reaped any greater bene-
fit from Labor rule than from that of the
old extravagant placemen and private-in-
terest servers whom it supplanted. As a
plain fact, Labor and Liberalism have been
playing the ancient game of Tweedledum
and Tweedledee, and to place Tweedledee
in office and keep him there is a precious
poor achievement to show as the sole result
of Labor’s close-knit and iron-bound organ-
isation. The weakness of the Labor method
lies in its neglect of the prime factor in all
great movements. It ignores the import-
ance of the individual. Somewhere about
the middle of last century Tennyson de-
clared that “the individual withers,” while
Carlyle shouted at the top of his large
Scottish voice that the individual was about
the only thing that counted or ever could
count. Up to the present Carlyle’s
opinion is still making good, and all the
reformers who have been chasing the poet’s
notion are forever bashing their heads
against that awkward proposition which
will get in the road —the man with an in-
dividual opinion. He may happen to be a
big man of wide view, or a small man with
a narrow outlook and a large enthusiasm,
or he may be just an ordinary man with a
special endowment of pigheadedness or
ignorance, or of that pignorance which is a
combination of both; but, in any case, the
result to the close, iron-bound organisation
is the same. In N.S.W. Beeby has gone
and others may follow. The whole team is
restive under the party lash, and no one can
think of anything else but the lash to fit
the occasion. The history of the party in
Queensland is a long record of dissension
and the casting of prominent men into the
outer political darkness. In Maoriland the
Liberal-Labor machine which Ballance
started, and Seddon drove, and Ward tried
vainly to lubricate with Cohen’s gold, has
practically broken to pieces after a run of
two decades; and all who watched its pro-
gress admit that it ran as long as it did be-
cause it was a loose organisation which left
any amount of room for the individuality of
its engineers. It looks, then, as if the time
had come for sane supporters of progressive
movements in Australia to sit down and do
some solid thinking on the whole question of
party. The Labor machine, with the very
best intentions and enough enthusiasm to
carry it a long way, has been bitterly disap-
pointing to its warmest supporters. Clearly
the fault does not lie with the intentions or
the enthusiasm, but with the machine which
has been trying to work out the legislation
and reform. On the other hand, were indi-
vidual freedom granted to members of Par-
liament, and if Ministers were elected by
Parliament, and if the Referendum with
Initiative were brought into force, no indi-
vidual or combination of individuals could
by any sort of contrivance thwart the public
will or long delay the carrying out of its
demands. And then it would be utterly im-
possible to look back upon two years of
pledge-breaking, muddle and general failure
to do the thing most needed.
«.
A Billet for which None is Good Enough
but the Best.
Scandalised and grief-stricken at the Gov-
ernment’s amendments of the Judiciary
Act, Melbourne Argus came out with a
brace of typically ’‘Liberal” propositions.
They may be stated briefly as follows: —
(1) The work of the Court does not demand the
addition of a fresh Judge or Judges.
(2) If democrats are appointed, it follows that
they will be lawyers of inferior standing, and in
consequence the standard and authority of the Court
will be lowered in respect to all the general domain
of Law.
The statement that the Court needs no rein-
forcement is palpably idiotic. Even when
Justice O’Connor was alive and in good
health the Bench was scandalously under-
manned. Overwork helped materially to
hasten his end; it laid up Justice Barton
for the best part of a year; and it threatens
to fell C.J. Griffith before long. The
business of the Court is many months in
arrear, and things are growing worse month
by month. The Court does not merely re-
quire new judges; it demands them insist-
ently. So far as the political aspect of the
matter is concerned, the Government would,
of course, be as foolish as it would be im-
moral if it proceeded to pack the bench with
men of its own way of thinking, regardless
of all other considerations. It would also
be mad and wicked if it gave the job to a
man because he chanced to be a Roman
Catholic, or a South Australian, or a Jew,
or, indeed, anything whatever but a man of
first-rate capacity. If what the Argus calls
“lawyers of inferior standing” are appointed,
there will indeed be a public uproar; and the
community will do well to be scandalised.
But has this bland assumption, that every
democratic barrister is necessarily incom-
petent, any basis in fact? Anyone pos-
sessed of even a moderate acquaintance with
the Courts will smile broadly at such an idea.
The plain truth is, most of the conservative-
minded men who are mentioned in the daily
press as warm favorites in the race for the
Bench, know little of Constitutional law, and
less of law generally. And though an expert
in Constitutional law would be a valuable
asset to the Court, if he lacked other qualifi-
cations he would be an anomaly and an en-
cumbrance. The Court, it must not be
forgotten, deals with only one or two Con-
stitutional cases a year: the rest of its time
is occupied with appeal work of a compli-
cated nature. Only one type of man is
wanted for that onerous job—a first-rate
lawyer in large practice. If the Government
disregards that essential, and appoints some-
one because of his religion, or because of his
State, or because he is an opponent whom it
would be more comfortable to have out of
the way, or because he is a Tory, and hence
acceptable to anti-Laborites, it will be mak-
ing a very ghastly mistake. The best avail-
able brains are the only sort that Australia
wants in the Chief Court of the Common-
wealth, and they should be secured with the
serenest indifference to the political views
of their owner.
•
A New Measure, and Toryism’s Natural
Exasperation Thereat.
It was to be expected that the Fisher
Government’s proposal to educate the people
in regard to the meaning of the proposed
Constitutional amendments would make the
Opposition furious. The idea of the Minis-
try is, in the words of one of the anti-
Labor dailies, “to introduce a Bill to pro-
vide for the issue of a pamphlet containing
a statement by the two sides in politics of
the view which they take of the amend-
ments.” A sufficiently fair and reasonable
scheme on the face of it, one would think.
Yet Sydney Telegraph condemns it
haughtily (18/12/T2) as “an extraordinary
notion,” and “a scheme which is grotesquerie
itself,” and waxes bitterly sarcastic on the
subject of “errand-boy literature,” and the
huge stocks of waste paper that “the work”
will be responsible for. The true Conserva-
tive always mistrusts the education of the
masses in political or social questions. His
policy flourishes best in the dark. And this
is peculiarly true with regard to the Refer-
enda questions. A negative vote is a cer-
tainty next year if the electors can only be
kept as ignorant as they were in 1911. It
is natural that people should vote conserva-
tively on those issues which they do not un-
derstand. In Switzerland, the most daringly
progressive of European countries and the
home of the Referendum system, this has
always been so. Most of the measures
which have since been found to be highly
beneficial were rejected two and three times
and occasionally oftener. When the Nation-
alisation of Railroads campaign was first
started the Cantons found their repre-
sentatives taking two widely-divergent
points of view. Those who were for
the maintenance of the status quo,
and who considered _ that the time was
unripe for any enterprise of the sort, argued
primarily that the inauguration of a system
of Socialistic railroads amounted to robbery
and anarchy, and would operate to drive
vast masses of capital out of the country.
They also claimed that a gross wrong would
be done to the Cantons; that the National
Government would be empowered, if it
were given control of the railways, to dif-
ferentiate injuriously between the various
units of the Confederation, and that it
would not hesitate to do so. And, of course,
they contended that under Federal owner-
ship the railway service would be infamously
bad (the good old match and cigarette in-
dustries of France being dragged in to point
the moral), and they prophesied that the
wages of the railway servants would be
awful. The case for nationalisation rested
on such dull and complicated issues as fin-
ance, the terms on which the roads and
rolling stock might be acquired from the
private companies that owned them, and
the likelihood of the Federal Government
being able to lower rates and provide im-
proved services. What wonder that the
vague melodrama of the reactionaries won
the day for a while? In that campaign,
as in the struggle to achieve a
Federal Factory to found a State Bank,
and to establish an alcohol mono-
poly, the party of progress only won when
it had driven the meaning of its proposals
into the collective head of the people by
sheer force. The thing was done by a pam-
phleteering campaign of the very sort which
the Fisher Government provided for last
week. There was no favoritism. The
Hebrew railway magnates, the manufac-
turers and the publicans who disapproved
of the Swiss proposals had the same oppor-
tunities to lay the merits of their cases,
such as they were, before the electors, as
the monopolists and low-wage enthusiasts of
Australia will have under the measure which
came before the National Parliament last
week. In the end the Swiss mono-
polists went down. And the moment
the Commonwealth grasps the signifi-
cation of the Referenda questions the
same catasirophe will happen to the local
monopoly party. The Telegraph sees the
downfall coming, and in its capacity of true
and faithful servant of the monopolists’ in-
terests, it is naturally annoyed.

An Object Lesson in Nation-building.
“Dingo” from Capetown :
I wish you would send Bruce Smith to S’Africa.
I understand that he’s one of those extremely modest
men who don’t think half enough of either them-
selves or their opinions. If he would only spend
a few months here he would see how experience sup-
ports all his theories. As Mr. Myth knows, three
things a country needs to become great and pros-
perous— (1) plenty of colored labor; (2) plenty of
foreign capital; (3) plenty of Freetrade. S’Africa
has all three. (1) For every white person there are
five colored. (2) There is so much foreign capital
that the real owners of the country, who can even
run the Empire into a ghastly war, live in Park
Lane, Berlin, Paris and other haunts of the Noses.
(3) The tariff is mostly of the revenue-producing
description that Mr. Myth loves. And this is a
glimpse of the “jolly and fat” condition of the
country under these blessings. There is one banking
corporation with headquarters for S’Africa in Cape-
town in which there are about 60 employees. Of
these, only 14 receive salaries allowing them to
marry. Reductions in salaries were made by this
bank about six years ago on account of hard times.
Tellers were then in receipt of the exorbitant salary
of £l3 6s. Bd. a month. From that 10 per cent,
was deducted owing to the shrinkage of the dividend
on the foreign capital. The banks are all foreign;
all dividends are paid outside the country, and so the
directors don’t hear the protests of the overpaid
clerk. Insurance companies are almost as bad. They
too are mainly foreign, including under that title
the Colonial Mutual and the National Mutual,
which are Australian. There is one big local insur-
ance co., which is relatively as strong as is the
A.M.P. in the Commonwealth; but its salaries are
not much better than those of its foreign competi-
tors. The only manufacturing industries, bar a little
furniture-making, are devoted to cigarettes, soap
and dynamite. In the cigarette and soap-making,
colored girls do nearly all the work, and foreign
Jews own the factories. One big tobacco factory
proudly shows a list of 400 employees receiving m
all about £5OO wages a week. The average clerk’s
salary is £7 a month. Flappers are working at
30s. a month in most of the business houses. Rag-
shop hands are worse off. In Capetown alone over
1000 girls who are just nearing the age of potential
maternity are learning stenography and type-click-
ing. Three of one insurance co.’s servants are now
awaiting trial for alleged embezzlement of pre-
miums, etc. —one in Jewburg, one in Durban and one
in Capetown. But juries are beginning to argue on
these lines: “If accused has diverted the company s
money into his own pocket, he has simply reimbursed
himself for the moneys the directors have stolen from
him by way of salary.” Such reasoning may not be
sound, but it is prevalent here. Quite naturally, the
Australian is not a popular man in the country. He
is a good worker, it is admitted; but he wants to
be well paid—and to want to be well paid is an
enormity when there are allegedly-cheap niggers
around, and foreign capitalists to feed, and a tariff
that permits the cheap foreign factory to pour its
stuff into the country.
How a Large Amount of Capital is Kept
Out of the Country.
The directors of Italy’s biggest hat factory
recently issued a printed statement of their
achievements in the arena of commerce,
the occasion or provocation being the Brus-
sels Exhibition of 1910. It makes sad read-
ing for those who are interested in building
up Australian manufactories and adding to
the sparse population of the Commonwealth.
This firm is easily the biggest individual
rival with which the local felt-hat builder
has to contend. It has secured such a grip
on the men’s soft felt hat trade of the Com-
monwealth that in 1909 (the last year for
which statistics are supplied) it was able
to export to these parts over 80,000 of its
wares. As 1910-’ll-’l2 were all bumper
years, it is safe to put the imports to Aus-
tralia of this one maker’s lids at 100,000
per annum during that period. Wages
Boards, Arbitration Courts and similar de-
vices are unknown in the land of the Dago,
and labor is consequently dirt-cheap. The
firm itself supplies figures to show that the
average wage per head in these, the highest-
grade mills in Italy, is 10s. per week, while
the average wage-cost of each hat is 9d.
Now, the employees in Australian mills can,
without difficulty, earn £4 per week. What
development of the hat-manufacturing busi-
ness can be expected under those circum-
stances with a duty of 35 per cent. —a duty
which, as above mentioned, lets in a matter
of 100,000 hats per annum from one foreign
firm alone? In 1913 there will be upwards
of 100,000 men in the Commonwealth wear-
ing this one firm’s felt hats, for which they
will have paid an average price of 12s. each.
If these had been fashioned on the spot, the
labor charges, at a conservative estimate,
would have been 2s. 6d. per lid. So that
the one Italian firm removes, in a manner
of speaking, £12,500 worth of workers’ wages
from the country every year. And that is
without taking into consideration the dam-
age done by the rest of the overseas hat-
exporters. The bogus Laborite who, by
persistently dodging the tariff issue, is re-

sponsible for this state of affairs is a good
friend to the wealthy importer, and in a
lesser degree to his little staff of ill-paid
clerks; but he is the worst sort of enemy to
Australia. And even from a selfish point
of view he is guilty of bad business. A mob
of Dagoes in an Italian factory can do no
good to an Australian Labor party, while
every well-paid workman in an Australian
factory is a potential unit added to the
strength of that party.

The unaccountable lighthouse smash at
Port Adelaide has been “sat upon” by vari-
ous courts, and the more it is discussed the
more unaccountable it becomes. The light
over the old Norma wreck is supposed to
have scared the Dimsdale’s captain off his
course, but how it was possible to sail clean
into a brilliantly-lighted beacon nobody
knows. The collanse of the structure (which
cost nearly £20,000), leaving the ship prac-
tically uninjured, is another strange point.
The ultimate verdict on Captain Jones, for
the loss of the light and the lives of the two
good men who kept it, is a fine of £5O and
suspension of his master’s-certificate for a
year; but the probable ruin of a career is
the heaviest penalty.
A send-off:—
John Hughes, M.L.C., solicitor and some time
Vice-President of the Executive Council of N. S.
Wales, died rather suddenly last week. He was a
good type of citizen—one of those steady-going char-
acters who don't do anything with dazzling brilliance,
but do everything moderately well. Environment
(he was the son of a well-to-do local merchant) and
education (he was a product of Stonyhurst, Eng-
land’s biggest R.C. school) did much to make him
a “Liberal.” But he had few other faults. Of him,
as of the late Abou Ben Adhem, it might be written
that he “loved his fellow-men” ; he was a generous
and broad-minded soul, and as straight as a die. His
one definite weakness was for the ornate uniform or
livery that he wore at Government House receptions
and other functions of the sort. And, certainly, h'is
handsome 6ft.-odd looked its very best in this bizarre
and eye-arresting costume.
General-manager Knox, of the C.S.R.,
wept in the papers as soon as the Sugar
Commission’s report was issued. The very
idea of standardising the price of sugar
harrowed Mr. Knox. How monstrous it
would be to fix the price at (say) £2O when
the co. might 12 months before have bought
the same sugar in foreign parts on a £25
basis! It would be heart-breaking, of
course; still Australia might struggle to
grow all its own sugar, and the co. might
encourage it to do so. Over this home-grown
sugar there could be no trouble, because the
co. buys its raw material (either raw sugar
or cane) at a price subject to market move-
ments. But, apart from that, when Mr.
Knox wept over the losses the co. might
make by buying foreign sugar on a £25-per-
ton basis and having to sell it at £2O, he
might have mentioned the awful wrench it
would be to make a profit bv buying sugar
at £l5 and being compelled to sell it at £zt).
“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter” :
On Saturday I went up to Sydney Government
House grounds with Col. Ryrie, M.H.R. ; Tom Hen-
ley, M.L.A. ; a few of the Liberal Ladies’ Associa-
tion, and some others of our set, to discountenance
the vulgarity of the lower orders at the taking-over
exhibition. But, la, I thought to have sunk through
the sacred soil for shame. We sang the National
Anthem, of course, in the teeth of the canaille, but,
when we came to the second verse, this is how we
did it:—
O Lord our God, arise,
Scatter his enemies
And make them fall;
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks;
On Thee (the Daily Telegraph printed it
with a small t) our hopes we fix,
God Save the King.
Of course the last line should have been, “God save
us all.” It would even have been better to have
sung it, “On Thee our hopes we fix, After the ball.”
That would, at least, have rhymed, even if it did
nothing else.
Concerning a poor, distressed co.:—
In the C.S.R.’s “reply” to the Sugar Commission’s
report the fat co. announced once more that its
prices are regulated by the world’s markets, and it
hinted that, much as it would sometimes like to
reduce prices and thus cut down its profits, it
simply couldn’t do it on account of this bogey of
the world’s markets.” It may therefore be interest-
ing to notice that “first marks” were selling at
£2l 10s. f.o.b. Hamburg on Sept. 25, 1911, the
highest point touched; and when the price came
down to £l6 ss. f.o.b Hamburg on Dec. 19, no
alteration was made by the C.S.R.—evidently because
there was nobody else in the market to compete with
the philanthropist. Following the quotation of £l6
ss. f.o.b. Hamburg on Dec. 19, the market slightly
advanced to £l9 f.o.b. Hamburg on Feb. 16, 1912-
from there it gradually declined to the level of
£l7 18s. 4d. on March 5, back to £l6 15s. on
April 5, still back to £l5 10s. on June 5, and so on
down to £l4 15s. on July 5. This continuous fall
went on till, on August 31, the price was £l3 13s.
4d. f.o.b. Hamburg. On that date the C.S.R. actu-
ally lowered, its prices only 10s. a ton, although
the world’s markets had dropped from £2l 10s.
to £l3 13s. 4d. As Mr. Knox says the C.S.R.
prices are regulated by the world’s markets, he
might explain why his price, which was £24 per
ton on Nov. 1, 1911, should have been lowered to
the extent of only 10s. per ton on Aug. 31, 1912,
followed by 20s. per ton on Oct. 5 last (30s. per ton
altogether), as against a decline of £7 16s. Bd. per ton
in the foreign (Hamburg) market in the correspond-
ing period. In view of these and other facts, it is
urgent, not only that sugar cultivation should be
encouraged in the North, but that a refinery should
be established in Queensland in co-operation with
the “central” mills.

A first-time-in-Australia Marlowdrama
was produced at Sydney Adelphi on Satur-
day night, under the title of “The Monk and
the Woman.” In keeping with the chief
business of ordinary life the pursuit and
possession of a woman is the backbone of the
play, but, on account of her extra-special
qualities in the way of looks and get-up and
passionate eye-flash and intelligence and
noble character and a few other feminine
traits, the pursuit of Liane (who is Miss
Nellie Bramley in the ordinary course of
things) by the King of France, a monk or

bidden Marriage," Melbourne Princess's.
two and a prince is unusually strenuous. To the
forces arrayed against the virtuous Liane
add Miss Nellie Fergusson, who, for the time
being, is the worst hussy in the harem, or
something equally bad, and the difficulties of
the distraught female become simply stag-
gering. The King (the usual 16th century
kind) is a host of reprobates in himself, and
his pal, Henri de Montrale (Mr. Tom
Lloyd), is a high-roller in all those things
that the Wowser never stops thinking about.
Thus, were it not for a calm, heroic ecclesi-
astic named Paul, this story would have had
a shameful ending. But the villains fall
out. The King is pushed through the win-
dow of things by Henri, and just when the
said Henri is about to blot out the aforesaid
ecclesiastic and swallow the girl, the effi-
cacy of prayer is given another chance.
Paul, the monk, who is George Cross in dis-
guise, calls upon Heaven, in a loud voice, to
help the good cause, and particularly to lay
it over Henri. The which is promptly
done (with the assistance of the stage-
manager) ; for whereas Henri was a moment
before safe and sound in his chateau, he now
finds the walls tumbling to ruins in an earth-
quake, while a volcano floods the vicinity
with fire and fried mud and lava and gen-
eral Gehenna. That settles Henri, and the
gallery on the opening night had only one
opinion about it: Good enough for the cow!
The incidents of the piece are more sub-
dued than in the ordinary run of Adelphic
drama, and from a scenic and stage-carpen-
tering point of view is away ahead of any-
thing the Marlow management has done.
The earthquake scene in the last act, where
Henri gets it in the neck, leads the good
Christian, at this season of peace and good-
will, to ruminate on what happened to
Sodom, likewise Gomorrah. In distributing
rewards for character representation, Mr.
Tom Lloyd, who made his first appearance
at the theatre, is called on first, with Gerald
Kay Souper (the King), Nellie Fergusson
(his Majesty’s unofficial wife), Nellie
Bramley and C. R. Stanford (Father Igna-
tius) close up. The others are from fair to
medium, or vice versa, or something to that
effect. “The Monk and the Woman” will
continue until further intimation, and
matinees will break forth on Boxing Day
and New Year’s Day.

“Milestones,” now triumphantly running
at Sydney Criterion, contains no bril-
liant dialogue, no dramatic climax; but the
details of the setting and the admirable cast
get the pervasive charm of the slight thing
over the footlights. In one respect the
authors have erred. The Victorian era was
the period of big families; but here are two
families with only a “pigeon pair” of chil-
dren each. In fact, there is a clear case of
race suicide in the Rhead and Sibley fami-
lies, for after two generations there are only
three grand-children from four ancestors, one
of whom never married. The evolution pro-
ceeds on these lines : kerosene —gas —electric
light; tight trousers —bell-bottomed trousers
—tubes; clean shaves to the ears —side-
whiskers —clean shaves; hansom cabriolets —
omnibuses —motors ; downcast eyes—fluttered
glances—the cold, glad eye; forehead kisses
—unexpected embraces —prosaic kisses (off) ;
kneeling proposals—standing proposals—sit-
ting-on-the-stairs proposals; crinolines—
bustles —sheaths ; iron ships—steel ships—
reapers and binders ; crocheting—knitting—-
idle hands ; swoons —tears —snorts ; ringlets
—fringes—waves ; book-muslin —glace-silk —
satin de soie; cast-iron corsets —whalebone
corsets —elastic corsets.
“Florodora” is the Christmas meal at Her
Majesty’s. Sydney, and theatre-goers are
fairly wolfing it. When the coffee and
cigars stage of the banquet draws nigh this
paper will notify the fact; at present the
public doesn’t seem to have got beyond the
fish course.

After a successful tour, and a good look-
in at Adelaide, Allen Doone brought “The
Wearing of the Green” back to the Sydney
Palace on Saturday night. Since The Btjl-
letin saw the show last
(July, 1912), it hasn’t al-
tered its opinion that it is
merely a pleasant trifle, cal-
culated best to attract (a)
the young person who likes
her leading actor to be (1)
cold and unapproachable, as
one consumed by a Great
Sorrow (it’s mostly indiges-
tion, but that by the way),
(2) brutally strong and mas-
terful (due. often to long
battling with the bailiff and
lowering portmanteaus from
the boarding-house in the
dead of night). (3) debon-
air and handsome; and Cb) the ultra-
emotional Irish folk. The young person is
cheered up with Doone’s effeminately good-
lookingface and his make-up, and the Irish
will stick to him if only for the way he
sings the songs that reach their heart. The
piece opened to big business, and will not
be changed for a week, anyhow.

The Tivoli has nothing new to offer this
week, except the announcement that to-
morrow night will see the last of Nella
Webb and De Biere. However, there still
remain on the programme the Beni Zoug
Zoug Arab whirlwinds, Thomas Bentley, the
Dickens character artist, the Three Keltons
and ragtime singers Taylor and Arnold, and
they are a very fair lot to go on with.

At the National Amphitheatre La France,
a fair damosel of French extraction, is ap-
pealing to the public’s aesthetic sense—that
elevating sentiment which causes surf-bath-
ing to be the popular spectacle it is, and
encourages the business of selling opera
glasses and telescopes to Wowsers to go up
by leaps and bounds each summer. La
France makes her appeal iu a series of poses.
She is great. Ben Hassan, an Indian fakir,
has arrived, and is baffling the multitude by
the perfection of his conjuring. He wishes
it to be understood that he is no connection
whatever of Ben Habdah, the Asiatic whom
the late Wade Administration treated so
kindly just prior to last N. S. Wales elec-
tions. His people have been respectable con-
jurers and non-politicals for generations.
There is a certain sameness about the rest of
the bill, such almost historical names as Fred
Curran, Jules Garrison. Barnes and West
cropping up on every side.

Christopher Columbus has been demanding
attention at the Crystal Palace this week.
Columbus, Esq., has already had one season
at the Town Hall, but evidently J. D. Wil-
liams feels that something more is due
to the badly-used old man for discover-
ing America; for no America would
have meant no J. D. Williams, . and
no J. D. Williams would have meant no Cry-
stal Palace. There are some dramatic
moments in the show, as, for instance,
when the half-naked mariner picks up the
floating weed that tells him land is near.
“Williams’s Weekly” at the same filmery
contained the usual number of interesting
local happenings. “The Oath of Stephen
IIuller,” at the Lyric—a sequel to “The
Unwritten Law” which recently flicked at
that theatre —and “The Veiled Prophet,”
founded on Thomas Moore, at the Empress,
were the best of the other Williams films.

the wee ¥.y J° b of remarking, as differ-
e?ny u as po ? slb l e » that “Puss in Boots” is
still happening at Her Majesty’s. The ex-
travaganza follows on the musical-comedy
lines of the last Williamson panto. Al-
though, as usual, strong on the spectacular
side, its. first act is less notable from a scenic
standpoint than the first part of the “Sin-
bad production. Fairies, elves, etc., are
not unnecessarily numerous, having been
chased off the premises by the spirit of mod-
ernity, which is responsible for a pleasing
scene in the female dormitory of Dame
Shortly s hut or palace, where a lot of nice
girls sit up in bed to watch Fred Leslie and
• shake their agile understand-
ings. The same militant up-to-dateness must
be held accmintable for the inclusion of a
large quantity of ragtime gargling, or
hustle music, which need not be understood
to be appreciated. Interruptive turns are
provided by the Gaudsmiths, clown acrobats,
who receive valuable assistance from a tribe
of hounds; and Collins and Hart also make
their living acrobatically. A feature of the
second part is a hunting ballet, brought from
Paris.
* * * *
On the comic side the show is well pro-
vided for. George Miller is a Dame whom
to know better will probably be to love; Pip
Powell, an extraordinary monarch whose ex-
istence is at least nine arguments in favor of
republicanism: and Fred Leslie, a casual
larrikin, entitled to loud “hear, hears” for
his dancing. Miss Violet Loraine, the prin-
cipal lad, is a rather lightweight blonde, who
is more masculine without being less femin-
inely alluring than last year’s “boy”; Miss
Alice Russon is a principal airl who, on a
first acquaintance, fails either to impress or
depress; an “old girl” in the nerson of Miss
Dorothy Firmin makes a pretty fairy ; and
that decorative Australian, Miss Marie
Eaton, is a gold-stick-in-waiting who would
grace any court, just as Ivy Schilling’s danc-
ing (not to mention her mere presence)
would make even a Government House ball
worth the price of admittance. And, finally,
O. E. Lennon’s diverting cat Slyboots gives
some promise of growing up into a zoologi-
cal classic like the Sosh Tiger and the Dry
Dog.

The latest offering to the gods at the
Princess’s is “Her Forbidden Marriage,” a
Marlowdrama in which the hero wears the
snowy thatch of eld, and the chief male
wrongdoer mostly behaves like a young
man predestined to be named Percy.
Since the advt. confidently avers that
those who see the play “will surely
get married,” it might prove a good
business move on the part of a local matri-
monial agency to hire advertising space on
the Princess’s curtain, and employ agents
in the gallery to distribute coupons, entitling
their holders to special terms. The theatre
will be occupied on Boxing Night by “The
Girl Who Took the Wrong Turning”—
understood to be half-sister of the damsel
who was recently Driven to Destruction.

Nowadays the Opera House programme is
largely devoted to forecasting the arrival of
De Biere, who is due on Saturday next. In
the meantime there are the Lancaster Opera
co., whose unexciting vocalism is entitled to
a fair measure of respect; My Fancy, who
danced recently before the Throne, and so
wins the applause of all who are not pro-
Boers ; Claire Romaine, male impersonator;
Minnie Kauffmann, one of the trickiest of
lady cyclists; and the Ilallis and Wilson

An all-green entertainment, “Ireland To-

scenes and songs of a strictly Hibernian
character. The advt. puts forward the in-

Erin,” but in the meantime Erin has come
most of the way to meet them. Boxes of the
most distressful country have been brought
out, and the soil will be spread down the
passages between the seats, so that the sen-
timental exile can carry away on the soles
of his boots some of his own, his native land.

The Smart Set still carry on business at
the Tarts’ open-air theatre on the St. Kilda
Esplanade (Vic.). The Smart Setters are
seven, and the prevailing raspberry of their
attire hints at a sobriety which their jests
and jingles fail to dispel. Judged by such
representatives as Walter George and Miss
Georgie Martin, they are amusing without
lapsing into frivolous behavior, and they can
warble the latest tunes and airs in a pleas-
ing if unimphssioned way. They possess
very passable songsters in Oswald Preston
and Miss Emily Kroll, and an eccentric
comedian and ventriloquist in Edward
Elliott. This whimsical citizen, who has the
outlines of a walking stick or a fountain
pen, is a very popular feature, and there
seems a disposition on the part of the
audience to call him Edward, or even led.
Another chapter of Captain Scott’s doings
in Antarctic regions has been unfolded at

fore you take Gwendoline for a stroll to the
Pole. The pictures showing the arrange-
ments for board and lodging on the icy
slopes are especially interesting, and when
the audience is confronted with the methods
of making a meal, it learns something new
in domestic economy. _ In the fiction depart-
ment the main suit was “Britannicus
Tragedy (after Racine),” revealed with in-
tense gesticulation by a selected crowd from
the Paris Odeon. A more skilfully acted
item was “Coronets and Hearts,” a sort of
pictorial tornado with a lovely hero, several
bandits, and the inevitable girl.

The P’l-an Lyric (Vic.) last week bio-
graphed a long story of criminal misbe-
havior in which an elusive spieler called
Handsome Charlie has many exciting and
picturesque moments. Charlie is aided in
his wickedness by a podgy gent, and a
buxom Flossie. The trio plan a midnight
robbery, which ends in the arrest of Flor-
ence and Podge, and the demise of the prin-
cipal man. The picture is an unusually
clever piece of detective fiction, and the last
chase of Charlie, unconsciously heading for
the undertaker, is a spirited bit of make-
believe. “Algy—Did He Deserve It?” was
an innocently giddy contribution, and “Her
Awakening” was a modern seaside version of
the tale of the reptile in Eden.

In a hot and quiet week, Adelaide’s chief
dramatic event has been “The Tyranny of
Tears,” staged by the Appendreena Society.
This is the Haddon Chambers play whose
witty, inconsequent dialogue aroused a
strong suspicion that .Oscar Wilde had a
hand in it. Its one fault is too much talk,
too little action,, Miss Ethelwyn Robin, as
the weepy wife, and Len Chamberlain (the
cricketer), as the strong, good-natured hus-
band, did good work in parts a little outside
their usual range. As the lady secretary (Mrs.
Brough’s old part) Miss Kathleen Suther-
land was just about It. The rest of the
small cast was in safe hands, and Clement
May—yvho coached —-obliged with a neat
sketch of the butler. But it would be a
better play if ruthlessly “cut” by 10 to 15
minutes.
Nellie Farren, the Gaiety girl, is in the new vol.
of the “Dictionary of National Biography.” It is
admitted that she was neither tall nor beautiful, nor
had she an agreeable singing or speaking voice, but
“the charm of her individuality triumphed over all
stage defects, and her good humor and ready stories
of drollery gave her an omnipotence over the average
theatre-goer.” Omnipotence!
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Harrison O.”: I haven’t seen it mentioned lately
that George Rignold once played Romeo to five
different Juliets during one performance. It was in
N’Yark, at a benefit show. The Misses Capulet were
Fanny Davenport, Aila Dyas, Minnie Cummings,
Maudie Grainger and Marie Wainvvright. Said'
George, upon being called before the curtain, “Youi
see, I have survived it.”

“Haresfoot”: Just as I’m certain that the inter-
state steamboat combination is good for passengers:
(contrast our coasters with the English, and even
the American), so I do think the Williamson-
Clarke-Meynell conjunction is working out all right'.
Look at the 1913 programme: Quinlan, heaps of
novelty by the new comic opera companies, a new'
Gilbert and Sullivan co., Waller in “Henry V.,”'
Asche in “Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “Air-
tony and Cleopatra,” Shakspeare galore, and 1
“Faust,” promised in tip-top style by the regular
dramatic co.
A note from John Galsworthy: “I see that a, cor-
respondent (B. 5/9/’l2) has given you what pur-
ports to be Mr. Haddon Chambers’s reply to the
critics who noticed a likeness between his ‘Passers-
by’ and my play, ‘The Pigeon.’ Mr. Chambers says
‘The Pigeon’ was produced in London some months
after ‘The Passers-by.’ I’m afraid I must confess,
to my regret, that I have never seen or read ‘Pas-
sers-by,’ or indeed any play by Mr. Haddon Cham-
bers. ‘The Pigeon’ was finished just before ‘Pas-
sers-by’ was produced. Your readers may rely on it
that, if there be similarity, there was no plagiar-
ism.”
“Grandpa”- What commonplace affairs are your
theatres of to-day! I mind visiting the Theatre
Royal in Castlemaine in ’54 to see G. V. Brooke
play “O’Callaghan on his Last Legs. It was a
charity affair, and all the rest of the performers
were amateurs of the first water—or some other liquid.
i\j c O the renowned lawyer, played the Irish at-
torney. Two citizens were deputed to keep him sober
during the day; but when the performance began the
two guardians were lying helplessly full in the
Cumberland cellar, and Mac was not to be found.
He was at last discovered and pushed up on the
stage. He scrambled up on a barrel, and began to
fiddle. Then the top fell in, and he couldn’t get
out till some one chopped the barrel open. When
that had been managed he came to the front of the
stage and said: “Gentlemen of the jury, you re a
lot of sausages, and those of you who haven’t been
in the logs are certain to be there very soon.
Good night.” Then Lola Montez came on to dance
the spider dance. Yum! Yum! Afterwards she
came to the front and said, apropos of nothing in
particular, that she had Spanish blood in her veins.
One of the audience cried out: “You lie. You are
Never mind what he said. It was very rude.
“I’ll shout for all hands if anyone will show me the
in an who said that,” cries Lola. A carpenter l lo * ll
Campbell’s Creek got on the stage and repeated the
-words There was hooting and crying out and pelt-
ing of things at him. The crowd was going to
lynch him, and began to rush the stage. Sergeant
Fleming, of the police, pushed his way forward, but
was thrown off, and had two ribs broken. That, of
course, set the police going in earnest. Using their
handcuffs as weapons, they swung themselves around
and soon cleared the theatre. Ah, there was some
joy going to the theatre in those days !
“Hamer” : The Actors’ Union is finding the course
of arbitration about as smooth - as a footpath of oyster
shells. Twelve months ago it first made applica-
tion for registration as a union under the Arbitra-
tion Act, and the High Court decided a week or so
ago that the Registrar might view acting as an in-
dustry and consider a second application, the-first
registration having been cancelled in consequence of
a technical error in the date of the issue of the cer-
tificate of registration. J. C. Williamson, Ltd., and
•other metropolitan managers, tried to secure from the
High Court an injunction restraining the Registrar
from doing anything of the kind, with the main re-
sult that J. C. Williamson, Ltd., and others will have
to pay everybody’s costs. And as costs in the High
Court are usually considerable, the Actors’ Union
these days wears almost the first smile it has ever
been guilty of.
Still another new picture theatre, the Empire, is
to be built in Bourke-street, Melbourne, a few doors
west of. the Eastern Arcade, the site of the former
Haymarket Theatre. Yet the thing seemed to be
overdone already; neither the Majestic, in Flinders-
• street, nor the Snowden, over Princes Bridge, has
come up to expectation, the Exhibition pictures have
failed, and the Saturday and Sunday shows at the
•Cyclorama, in Victoria Parade, have been dropped.
“The Chee-ild” : I love being put right, especially
by people who are capable of putting me all wrong,
and most especially when they do it in the nice,
superior-person style of reproof adopted by “C.
•Ockney” (B. 28/l'l/’l2), who tells me how inno-
cent I am regarding the one-act play or curtain-
raiser in London. The point of my par. was that
•elsewhere than in Australia (e.</., London), theatre
patrons expect and generally get a “raiser” as an
introduction to a short play, and I merely instanced
"■‘Alias Jimmy Valentine” as of the type calling for
ithis support. This roused “C. 0.” to the summit of
Ihi* patronising satire. “When ‘The Chee-ild’
■(prattles,” says he, “of bright curtain-raisers, I
'would like to ask where ? Not in London, surely!
There nowadays the piece of the evening is usually
preceded by Mr. and a piano, or a l ady
mimic.” lit was a nuisance to find that my experi-
ences in two trips to Europe and America were
mere illusions, but I determined to get rid of them
at once, and therefore turned up the latest file of
the London Sporting Times. There in the advt.
columns of the shows now running in Fogtown, I
was struck by this disclosure:—-
Haymarket.—“Bunty pulls the Strings,” preceded by
“Their Point of View.”
Wyndham’s.—“ Doormats,” preceded by “The
Quaints.”
■Criterion. —“Ann,” preceded by “The Poetasters of
Ispahan.”
Same house (promised).—-“Tantrums,” preceded by
“The Fortune Teller.”
Comedy.—“A Scrape o’ the Pen,” preceded by “All
Men are Fools.”
New Theatre. —“Ready Money,” preceded by “An
Object Lesson.”
"Playhouse.—“Hindle Wakes,” preceded by “Make-
shifts.”
Same house (promised).—“The Little Cafe,” pre-
ceded by “Aunt Bessie.”
Vaudeville. —“Little Miss Llewellyn,” preceded by
“The Maker of Dreams.”
Duke of York’s. —Three Short Plays.
Prince of Wales. —“Art and Opportunity,” preceded
by Mr. Warwick Price.
You will see I have not missed the lonely “Mr. W.
Price.” He may be “C. Ockney’s” “Mr. at
the piano” and the lady mimic rolled into one. Of
the other standard theatres (excluding Shakspeare,
musical comedy, leg shows and bellowdrama) there
remain a beggarly three apparently playing one piece
on its lonely, and none of them necessarily short
plays: “Drake,” “Milestones” and “Zaza.” Isn’t it
up to Mr. “Cockney” to get back to his native
Shoreditch to learn what they have been doing there
the last 100 years?
“Tara”: Apropos the Irish Show for Christmas at
Melbourne Town Hall. Once upon a time there were
two good Irish panoramas in Australia at once. The
Hibernicon was the name of one, conducted by
Ainsley Scott; the other was the Hibernica, under
little H.A. B. Williams. The latter’s comedian was Tim
Cohan —related, I fancy, to Cohan, author of “Get-
Rich-Quick Wallingford,” and to Josephine, who
•came to play in that bustling piece.
“Busk”: And “Fedora” (B. 5/12/’l2) was acted
in Melbourne by Mrs. Bernard Beere. Standing
made a frightful mess of Ipanoff, and so distressed
her that an apology had to be given. Otho Stuart
replaced him as leading man, whereupon Standing
;sank like Jack Murray behind Watt.
“Private Boxer” : London soon had enough of the
Shaw-Pinero-Barrie triple bill. It ran for three
weeks, and was then succeeded by a new play by
;Stanlaws, hitherto known as a black-and-white
•artist of the Dana Gibson school. Barrie sur-
vives. His one-acter, “Rosalind,” is retained, but
not as a curtain-raiser; it is to follow Stanlaws’s
piece, “Instinct.” The three-star triple-bill has
proved another of Charles Frohman’s costly experi-
ments. It has also proved (what everyone knew be-
fore) that Barrie is the most reliable of the present-
day dramatists. Indeed, if it had not been for the
little Scot’s contributions, Frohman would have pro-
bably shut up shop in London long ago.
, “Hassan”: Luna Park, J. D. Williams’s latest Mel-
bourne venture, comprises two gentlemen who have
surely discovered the very quaintest possible method
of making a living. They make their crust by pan-
dering to the degraded emotion in mankind which
takes delight in the misfortunes of others. You
supply the cash, they supply the misfortune. They
sit upon jointed perches, one on each side of a huge
face, the eyes of which are the targets. The Neros, in
■disguise, buy so many shots at so much, and throw
tennis balls at these' targets. If a ball hits the
•eye the platform on which the man perches parts
suddenly in the middle, and the victim drops into a
cold bath with a resounding splash. The night I
attended Luna Park was very hot, and the two dicky-
birds seemed quite happy. But I’m wondering what
will happen when a cold snap comes. Mr. Hunt will
"have, at least, two profoundly interested readers of
his weather prophecies during the next few months, I
think.
“Hullo”: There are only two types of Australian
drama that make money for their carpenters: ( )
The Australian melodrama, which, except in the
stage scenery, isn’t Australian at all; and (2) tne
Australian farce-comedy, in which there is»o plot
at all, but much good character-drawing. There are
only two examples of the latter class, On Ou
Selection” and “Mrs. McSweeney ; and from their
great popularity I judge that Australian audiences
will overlook the absence of plot or story as long as
Dad and Mrs. McSweeney will discourse on themes Aus-
tralian. Herein I see a high artistic culture in Aus-
tralian audiences. They are interested in character
and not in watching things merely happen. they
ought to take kindly to the modern discussion-play
when it arrives.
“Screen”: The Kalem Co. has just completed its
cine.-pictures of the Life and Death of Jesus, taken
on the historical spots, including Gethsemane and
Calvary. The cost lias run into £20,000. But now
comes the question, Will the public stand it. In
London, curiously enough, while the Christian
Herald approves the show, the Daily Mail censures
it. There is, at any rate, Ober-Ammergau ior a
precedent—if precedent is wanted.
“Theorbo”: Strauss’s new opera, “Ariadne in
Naxos,” has been produced in Stuttgart. A strange
freak it is, for which a hint perhaps came from the
vogue of the “Tales of Hoffmann.” Composers no\\-
adays seem to want to do something bizarre, like
this or “The Girl of the Golden West.” Strauss
clearly wrote for a unique voice, that of Madame
Siems. She is not of the calibre of Melba or Tet-
razzini, but can do more gymnastics. Thus Strauss
is like Sardou wrapping Fedora, Theodora and iosca
round Bernhardt. The plot is most eccentric, lirst
comes funniment by Jourdain, the theatre manager,
with his music master and dancing master. lhe
music master is tp furnish him with an opera, re-
lating to the loves of Bacchus and Ariadne. the
dancing master is to furnish a comic ballet, relat-
ing to Zerbinetta, a coquette. Jourdain insists that
he must see these two together. So there is a
jumble, illuminated by the music of Strauss. But
the affair may ultimately drop, like Mozart s Magic
Flute” and Weber’s “Euryanthe.” It overleaps the
rational bounds, just as Rostand’s “Chanticleer did.
“Lud”: Covent Garden’s history is more import-
ant than Drury Lane’s. Rich, the harlequin, in-
ventor of the modern pantomime, built and opened
it in 1732. Its first notable development was Han-
del’s production of his operas, from 1735 to
followed by the oratorio “Messiah” in 1743. Lold-
smith’s “She Stoops to Conquer” was first performed
there (1773), and Sheridan’s “Rivals” (1,75). Mrs.
Siddons there won her first London success (1780);
Garrick had played there 44 years previously. In
1805, after Trafalgar, a one-act piece called Nel-
son's Glory” was positively written, rehearsed and
acted in one day. In 1808 the theatre was . ~
stroyed by fire. New Covent Garden was opened in
1809. Drury Lane was burnt the same year. The
new Drury got hold of Kean ; the only new man of
weight Covent Garden could secure was Macready.
The latter’s subsequent lesseeship was noticeable for
“The Lady of Lyons” (1838) and “Richelieu
(1839). Then came the management of Matthews
and Vestris, giving Boucicault’s “London Assur-
ance.” The theatre was burnt for the second time
in 1856, after a Bal Masque which ended a two-
days’ gala under “Wizard” Anderson, who was
making ready to leave for Australia.
“Stargazer”: Notice how amorous inference grows
in the music halls ? The disposition of the stereo-
chronic, the man who sings, the inflamed comedian,
and the sketch artist to lug in saucy suggestions of
conduct only mentionable in divorce courts and
medical handbooks continues and accumulates. 1
was at a kaleidoscopic vaudeville parade the other
evening, and the sole wit. of five turns depended
upon he, she or it, while using' Sabbatarian sen-
tences, really insinuating startling love episodes and
conduct unbecoming in the unmarried. Are people
so greedy for this sort of stuff that they are not
nauseated after a procession of, say, four assorted
turns in which the performers strain their terrible
nerve to produce libidinous ideas? Apart altogether
from Wowserish considerations, it may be alleged
that the subject isn’t funny. A healthy mind per-
ceives it, indeed, to be the most serious on earth.
“F.”: “Ben Bolt” came to Sydney like this. In
the early ’so’s a company of minstrels, the New
York Serenaders, gave a series of concerts at the
Royal Hotel, George-street. (The room is now used
as Dymock’s book store.) One of the members, Mr.
White, by trade a compositor, sang “Ben Bolt, and
it became so popular that the A.S.N. Co. gave the
name to one of its steamers. “Jim” Kitts, after-
wards a theatrical agent, and mixed up with William
Saurin Lyster in operatic matters, was one of the ori-
ginal New York serenaders. So was J. M. Foans, who
afterwards kept the Shakspeare Tavern, opposite the old
Victoria Theatre in Pitt-street; both ancient institu-
tions are now wiped out. The tavern has been
supplanted by Baumann’s, and Mrs. McCathie’s
occupies the theatre site.
“Monkbarns”: A Melbourne bookseller has a Shaks-
peare folio of 1623, presented by Montgomery to
Hoskins. There is the following inscription by Mont-
gomery on the fly leaf: “Presented by Walter Mont-
gomery to William Hoskins, July 10th, 1869, in
pleasant recognition of one of the most enthusiastic
and worthiest students of the bard, and in happy
memory of a successful and delightful engagement in
dear and appreciative Sydney.” Montgomery did
well in Svdney, although that city did not worship
his Hamlet like Melbourne, where the season spurred
on the production of a book under the title of “Was
Hamlet Mad?” with preface by Haddon, editor of
the Argus.
DISAPPOINTMENT OR THE FLYING STOMACH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were many excellently arranged items in
the programme, well carried out, but some disap-
pointment was felt that the Desperado feat, in which
a young man is purported to dive from an 80ft
scaffold and to land on his stomach on a hardwood
disc was necessarily cut out. — Sydney D. 1.
We are not often moved to grief,
Or overwhelmed with woe,
Our sorrow is, in general, brief,
And scanty our tear-flow ;
But there are times (and this is one of them) when
anguish isn’t fleeting; when we could out-
weep the mutest mutes —every mother’s son
of them—and give Niobe, Rachel and Eugenie
Duggan ten pocket-handkerchiefs and a beat-
ing !
What resignation, what despair
That may be, or has been,
Can with this horrid blow compare,
This disappointment keen?
To think that such a show, so loudly lauded, should
dare to have defrauded a faithful, anxious
gathering which paid its cash, not to hear
base clowns blathering— hut to see the smash f
Oh, take your riders all away,
And send your tigers back !
However great and bright and gay
Your Circus, there’s a lack —
A lack indeed, which will be deeply felt—the fall,
the rush, the sickening thud, the welt — the
human like a hummock! This— this is absent
from the show ; lienee we declare we will not
go until we definitely know we’ll see the
Flying Stomach!

IN THE DAYTIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The kissing of ladies by strangers in Sturt-street
cannot be tolerated, especially in the daytime.
— Mr. Pearse, J.P., of Ballarat (Vic.).
There is a time to embrace and a time to refrain
from embracing. —Book of Ecclesiastes.
No, the daytime isn’t playtime for an amorous
bacillus ;
Little Cupid’s very stupid while the sun is blazing
high ;
But the night time is the right time for yearning
thoughts to fill us,
And a cuddle’s but a muddle till the stars are in
the sky.
Down at Coogee when the smoogy start their five
o’clock embraces,
Then it vexes and perplexes every expert at the
game;
For caressing is distressing while you see each other’s
faces;
When it’s darkened, seek the park, and Love will
burn with brighter flame.
When a flapper has a chap, or when a spinster has
a suitor,
Then the daylight is a gay light, but it’s not the
time to spoon;
Let the gloaming find them roaming; for there’sj
nothing that is cuter
Than seclusion from intrusion when the clouds have
hid the moon.
There’s decadence in the maidens who would hug in
daylight glaring ;
’Tis unpleasing to go squeezing till the Night her
veil has flung;
And if Sadie, Sue or Haidee in a daytime spoon is
sharing,
Well, the Preacher ought to teach her: she’s un-
pardonably young.

From a Tasmanian in the Bung business:
Ethically, dog doesn’t eat dog, but I’d like to have
a snap at some Sydney hotelkeepers— not of the variety
the Wowsers call “drink shops,’’ but top-notch hotels,
My grievance is this. I spent a few days in Sydney
lately and, though not at ail fastidious, I was first
y b™£“! h«rz
liquor spoilt. Barmen and barmaids alike seemed
to glory in parading the horrible germ-laden rags
on their arms or shoulders. Surely there’s a Board
of Health in Australia’s Queen City!
The Horticultural Society, of Melbourne,
and the Victorian Horticultural Improve-
ment Society are not playing speaks with
Treasurer Watt. The coolness arises over
a request for “assistance” in repeating the
show held in Melbourne early this year. To
that a ? ail „ the Government contributed
£3OO, the Horticultural Society £5O, and
the Improvement Society £35. This was
nice and kind of all parties, and when the
balance-sheet showed a credit of £l6O, an
innocent citizen might have expected the
amount to be parcelled out pro rata , each
party bearing its share of the loss. But the
two societies weren’t taking any pro rata
division. They ignored the Government and
its contribution, handed back the Horticul-
tural its £5O plus £l5 bonus, the Improve-
ment its £35 plus £lO bonus, and whacked
the odd £5O between the manager and the
secretary of the show—which was also very
nice and kind. But now, with another show
in view, these persons wish to bite Watt’s
ear for a second £3OO, and Watt is giving
them the glassy eye. There are occasions
when the glassy eye is full of merit.
‘Wahgite”: If “Larrakeah” knows any-
thing about the Northern Territory he’ll re-
cognise that whenever the two tribes had a
dispute the Wahgites gave the Larrakeahs
lophet. It s time this “Larrakeah” got
Tophet too. The work the Aborigines Pro-
tection Department has done is too good to
be allowed to suffer at the hands of a fool.
Ghief Inspector Beckett has seen and known
more niggers than “Larrakeah” wots of;
he. was in the Territory in ’B6, and spent
three years among tribes in Kimberley be-
fore white men were there, and has seen
more of the Territory than “Larrakeah’s”
tribal boundaries cover. The new Abori-
ginal Department • has cleaned up China-
town, made a decent village and large gar-
dens, built a hospital ward and made war
on the red plague, largely stopped enforced
prostitution and comboism, driven the lubras
out of Chinatown, and is now building a
school. The hawking of children by old
bucks—practically a slave market—is known
no more. Yet this “Larrakeah” has the gall
to attack the organisation which already
has done these thines —the most meritorious
department in the Territory.

Sydney Tramway Department .showed up
badly the other day. A passenger, whose
story seems to have been backed up by cre-
dible witnesses, wished to charge a conductor
with assault, alleging that the guard had
hrst used jiu-jitsu methods on his thumb, and
followed up the dislocation of that member
with a series of smashes. The guard’s num-
ber was taken and application made to some
tramway office _ for his name. It was re-
fused. A solicitor applied for it, and was
also refused. Then the police were asked
to collect it, and did so in 24 hours. The
legal process thereupon started, and at time
of writing, the conductor is committed to
take his trial. The only point open for pre-
sent discussion is, of course, the refusal of
the Tramway Department to give up the
man’s name. Guards and others wear num-
bers so that they may be quickly and un-
VAGUE.

“John Phoenix”: What miserable shanties
are provided as for children
attending country schools! Indeed, in a
great many grounds the shed never answers
to “the roll” at all. In others, four poles
are roofed with bark to provide nippers with
a retreat from the snow-laden blasts of win-
ter, the drenching rains of autumn, and the
bite of the summer sun. In the cities elab-
orate structures are provided for shelter.

DONE.
BROWN: “I got mixed up in a real estate deal
last week."
BROWNE: “Did you ?"
BROWN: “Yes, they did."
The State Cow of the Northern Terri-
tory walked into the forefront of things last
week, when a correspondent, writing from
Darwin to a Melbourne paper, alleged that
a man got 10s. a day for milking the animal,
while a nigger received 3s. a day to lead it
to pasture—probably with appropriate
music. He also stated that its food cost
255. per week. (Either the pastures weren’t
knee-deep in grass, or else the animal spent
the long, lone hours waving a defiant tail at
Japan.) Josiah Thomas, Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, hurriedly called up Adminis-
trator Gilruth by telegraph, and that emin-
ent horse-doctor, who is burdened with the
partially-employed title of “His Excellency,”
shoved other things to one side and ex-
plained that the allegations about the fear-
fully expensive cow were incorrect, and that
it had never cost more than 10s. weekly. It
was one of a few sent from the South for
demonstration purposes, and was kept at
Darwin to test the grand old assertion that
cows could not exist there. It, in common
with other Australian cows, had done so
well that two hotelkeepers had now two
cows apiece providing the stuff that goes so
well with tea and rum. As an example of
how careful Government House was of the
Departmental animal, His Ex. added that
on several occasions when no certificated
milker could be got, the milk-pump had been
worked by the Director of Agriculture in

The opening of the North Coast (N.S.W.)
railway to Taree will push one of the oldest
Australian coach lines out of a job. Dur-
ing the late ’3o’s a mail service was insti-
tuted between Stroud and the Manning
River by the A. A. Co., Stroud being at the
time the co.’s headquarters, and the whip
has cracked over that route ever since. The
early Jehus have apparently all gone; but
only about three months ago. the widow of
one of the first of them rejoined her long-
deceased spouse in the land where all travel-

The tremendous advertisement of Jack
Johnson seems to have done a certain amount
of good in helping the white race to under-
stand its own racial feeling. Following the
announcement of the big nigger’s matrimonial
adventures, a Bill has been introduced into
the Georgia (U.S.A.) Legislature, forbid-
ding the marriage of black with white It
is a marvel that this is not already law in
o\ei\ white man’s country. The chances
are that if Rome had enacted it in the time
of Augustus, or earlier, the 133rd Caesar
would still be coilducting the concert of
Europe from the old stand by the Tiber.

“Billy B.” rakes over a heap of time:—
Anent the recent
centenary of Bath-
urst (N.S.W.). Came
across, the other
evening, a General
Order, issued b y
Governor Macquarie,
dated May 31, 1819.
Sonic of it: “His
Excellency the Cov-
er n o r, having r e-
ceived and perused
the journal of a tour
lately made by
Charles Throsby,
Esq., by the way of
the cow pasture t o
Bathurst, in the
new-discovered coun-
try west of the Blue
Mountains, takes
this early opportun-
ity publicly to an-
nounce the happy
result of an enter-
prise which promises
to conduce in a very
eminent degree to
the future interests
and prosperity o f
the colony . . . On
the 25th of April
last he commenced
his arduous tour . . .
accompanied by Mr.
J. Rowley and two
servants, tog ether
with two natives as
guides, and brought
it to a happy ter-
mination on tiie 9th
of May by his arrival
at the hut of Lieut.
Lawson, on the
Campbell River,
within a short dis-
tance of Bathurst;
the whole time oc-
cupied in this expe-
dition being 15
days.” The Order
showed that Thros-
by’s idea was to find
an easier route over
the Blue Mountains
to the West for man
and beast than that
in use at the time.
For successfully car-
rying out the job he
was given 1000 acres
°f land m any part ot the country discovered by him-
self. Rowley received 200 acres ; Joseph Wild and
John Wait (servants to Throsby) each 100 acres. The
native guides were Cookoogong and Dual. Mac-
quarie rewarded them with clothes and bedding, ap-
pointed Cookoogong chief of the Burrah-burrah
tribe, and conferred a “badge of merit” on Dual.

“T.F.M.” : The Fisher Government has de-
creed that the naval station at Western Port
is to be known as the Flinders Naval Base.
But Flinders never entered Western Port;
and, in justice to the memory of the man
who was the first to do so, the time is ripe
for a ukase to the effect that Western Port
shall henceforward be known as Port Bass.
The present name was all right in the year
1798, when nothing was known of any ports
or harbors farther west, but to-day it is ab-
surd, and the alteration suggested, while
removing the absurdity, would be a tribute
to the memory of Bass, and not much of a
strain on the public purse.
A MATTER OF PRESSURE.
REJECTED S UITOR: “And, I suppose, as soon
as he asked you, you said yes?"
THE S UITED: “Oh, no, I didn't. Tie had to
squeeze it out of me. ”
THE MYSTERY OF NEVER TELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Australia Christmas has long been known as
the season of the drowning fatality. This pathetic
ballad is in line with old traditions.
The terraced garden, stooping down
To kiss the waters of delight,
Absorbed the shadows large and brown
Shed by the Summer robes of night;
Beyond, the energetic town
Was growing reasonably tight.
By various signs the star-beams knew
It was the happy Christmas Eve,
For numerous squeakers shrilly blew
A music fitted to bereave
Tf all their wits the giddy crew
Who strolled the streets of Make Believe.
But here upon the city’s skirt
A brooding silence seemed to lie,
Where earth-born lights were seen to flirt
With flashing glances from the sky,
And leaping waters tried to squirt
Their bright reflections in the eye.
The suburb of We Never Tell
Was full of whispers soft and clear—
Low-breathing notes that rose and fell
Like laughter sipping at a tear.
I thought the world went very well
Because the brown girl’s lips were near.
The garden creepers trailed above,
The waves were down beneath our feet,
It wanted but one little shove
To push us from our rocky seat,
And in the harbor damp a love
That, keeping dry, was very sweet.
The little shove arrived at nine.
We never knew what came behind;
Without a word, without a sign,
A something soft and large and blind
Butted our gladness in the spine
And made us think the world unkind.
The water round us all was wet;
The brown girl rose and shook her hair;
The rocks about the place were set
Up straight on edge and smooth and bare ;
I said, “I very much regret
There is no landing anywhere.”
She said, “Perhaps it were as well,
As we can neither of us swim,
To raise a little gentle yell
Before our parting eyes grow dim ;
I do not greatly like the smell
Of these cold wavelets sleek and slim.”
The loudest noise we could produce
Brought no one down to lend us aid ;
We found it not the slightest use
In such deep seas to try to wade ;
I said, “My soul is getting loose—
We’ll have to drown, I am afraid.”
The brown girl drowned at half-past nine,
Exactly where at first she fell;
Yet, circled by such love as mine,
She knew that everything was well;
She said that drowning was divine
Beneath the rocks of Never Tell.
Five minutes later I was dead,
Adrift upon the noiseless flood ;
I felt the cold wave steal the red
Out of my quite redundant blood ;
My large unnecessary head
Sank to its rest upon the mud.
The whole affair was somewhat sad,
But it was over by eleven ;
And, knowing death was near, we ha 1
Arranged to meet again in Heaven,
Where we arrived, and, duly clad,
Were called to prayers next morn at seven.
The suburb of We Never Tell
Was full of whispers soft and clear.
Low-breathing notes that rose and feli
Like laughter drinking down a tear,
But everything goes verv well
With Mabel and myself up here.

“Foe” discovers a patriot:—
Gaud Mayor Clarke is not the only man who is
trying to straighten up Sydney. The other enthusiast
was found on a recent midnight in a street where
every third building is out of line with the two ad-
joining. He was trying to give the place a more
symmetrical appearance by putting his shoulder to
the protruding ones and shoving them back into line.
It took a lot of perspiration and grunting ; but when
his worn boot soles lost their grip of the paving-
stones and slid back, his red face assumed a beatific
expression. “Now she moves!” he would say. Then,
as he stretched out and rested on the tips of his toes,
“Whoa, there! Not too far back!” He told me he
once got a six-storey place fairly going, and had to
hang on to the front door-handle to keep it from
crashing into the back of the next-street skyscrapers.
He also whispered confidentially that, providing he
could hire a cab-horse, he intended to extract some
well-known pub from a main street-front, and tow it
away where no one would ever be able to find it.
The thought of what thirsty customers would say
when they came along for a wet drink and discovered
nothing but the dry foundations seemed to give him
an immense amount of joy.
THE REPLY AMBIGUOUS.
THE LADY: “And did yon find the native
women decently clothed?”
THE M ISSIONARY: "Well — er-my dear lady,
they at any rate — er—conform to the pre-
vailing fashion of their white sisters.”
Madden, C.J., sentencing a man in Mel-
bourne to two years and a dose of cat, said:
“I am perfectly certain that the lash has
good effect. I hold the opinion that whip-
pings are the only means to curb these vicious
indulgences.” And when the sex-maniac has
taken liis catting and served his two years,
and commits a similar crime on being re-
leased, Madden, in sentencing him to more
cat and more gaol, will no doubt say exactly
the same thing over again- Sq they go on
repeating their errors, criminals and judges
alike.
From a Good Australian :
Gradually the superiority of Australian timber is
being recognised by the people who own it. ine
new State Savings Bank in Melbourne, with perhaps
the finest banking chamber in Australasia, and bette.
than anything of the kind m London, is entirely
fitted with Australian wood. Tasmanian blackwood
of the fiddle-back variety has been used as the
panelling of the dado in the big public chamber with
fine artistic effect. The graining of the designs ha*
been splendidly done by Mother Nature, a wood-
worker of great antiquity. Australian oak and las-
manian myrtle are used for all the fittings of the
building, which stands as an object-lesson to aid the
infinite development of the home timber industry.
We have the best woods in the world here, and their
free use in architecture is only prevented by a. bad
but fast-dving tradition that the foreigner can always
do it better. I have seen some fine buildings built
and decorated with wood in foreign parts, especially
in California, and claim the right to say the new
Melbourne Savings Bank building has few superiors
as regards internal decoration. The contract was
carried through by a well-known Adelaide firm, which
specialises in this class of work. May one hope the
Federal capital Commission will spend a morning in-
specting this latest triumph of Australian workmen
and material. The pity is that none of our rare
marbles have been used in the building. Some day
we’ll have a palace of our own, built of our own
wood and marble, to excel in grandeur the Parthenon,
with St. Peter’s at Rome and the Congressional Library
at Washington filling second and third places.
At the Melbourne District Court a few
days ago, the wife of a Gippsland specimen
of the Great Backbone sued him for mainte-
nance. She informed the Court that she had
been starved and beaten by her husband.
She had had to eat wombats, porcupines,
wallabies and wild pigs. The Bench was so
overcome that, with scowls in its voice, it
ordered the backbone to shell out ten (10)
shillings a week for the upkeep of a whole
wife. Instead of porcupines and wombats,
the fortunate woman will now be able to
browse on rich soups, fish, fowl . and the
delicacies of the season —that is, if she has
one meal a week, and doesn’t pay for lodg-
ing and steals necessary clothing. If she
wants three meals a day she’ll have only
about sd. a time to see her through. Even
porcupines cost more than fivenence.
Complaint is made that the tariff may not
be high enough to exclude Japanese soan.
But need we be nervous —don’t they say it
won’t wash clothes?
“E.O’F.”: Maud, the Jabbers’s imported
maid, held all the local records for stupidity ;
but they “kept her on” purely on account
of her kind heart and her washing-up,
which, if somewhat tempest-
uous, was at least a bit
better than that of the lady
help, a 8.A., who had given
herself a certificate of ex-
emption from all real work.
One night, after a realistic
imitation of an artillery
duel and the fall of a Turk-
ish citadel, the imported
maid approached Mrs. Jab-
bers, and, after explaining
that a girl friend wanted a
place, asked if Mrs. Jab-
bers knew anything about
“that Mrs. Borkings, what
was advertising in ter-day’s
paper.” Mrs. Jabbers, could
not remember any neighbor
of that name, and at last
asked to see the advertise-
ment. The triumphant
menial brought along the
daily sheet and fumbled
past the small advertising
print to a staring headline
on the cable paee: “SITU-
ATION IN THE BAL-
KANS.” The poor, tangled
female thought the whole
blazing war was a vacant job of brooming
and washing-up !

“Kodak”: A man who was convicted of
stealing a parcel from a Victorian railway
station was recently recommended to mercy,
on the ground that the utter carelessness of
the railway officials in leaving the parcel
lying on the platform put more than a reason-
able amount of temptation in his way. His
Honor, commenting on this, said “the facts
disclosed a very loose method of dealing
with parcels.” “Loose” is the right word.
I once saw a gentle-mannered old man ap-
proach a busy Victorian porter with a
neatly-tied parcel which he wished to des-
patch to Gohang. He carefully affixed the
stamps and delivered the treasure into the
porter’s hands. That official looked it over
calmly and dispassionately ; then he howled
to a remote confederate, “Bill —Go’ang !” and
flung the thing over his shoulder. It whizzed
across the office, and, hitting the handle of
a churn, burst like a bomb and poured its
contents into a large basket. I shall never
forget the expression on the consignor’s
wrinkled face as he darted round the coun-
ter and rescued the fragments. The porter
merely looked reproachfully at the stooping
ancient’s back, and drawled, by way of reply
to his muttered threats, “Gawblime, Dad,
we carn’t pars things roun’ on trays!” On
the whole, it was the most dignified rebuke
I ever heard administered under trying con-
ditions.
ON THE SYDNEY TO AUCKLAND

ENQUIRING YOUNG P ERSON: "Tell me, sailor,
what is that long rope trailing behind?"
DECK HAND: “Patent log, miss; tells us how

E. Y. P.: " Oh , how sweet! And is the other

The High Court now lays it down that
the mere fact that there have been negotia-
tions between employees and employers is
not in itself evidence of a dispute warrant-
ing the interference of the Arbitration
Court. This places the principle of Arbi-
tration in the central edifice of Queer-street,
the main thoroughfare in the town of
Muddle. It affords the latest illustration,
also, of the way in which the law can make
a travesty of a good thing by its habit of
being an ass. Arbitration in industrial
matters was invented as a method by which
strikes might be avoided; and the decision
that a strike must occur before arbitration
can be brought to bear seems about the
limit in folly. A similar decision in regard
to the first Arbitration Act in N. S. Wales
placed a large number of unions out of
court, and pretty well settled the usefulness
of that Act; and it is scarcely wonderful,
seeing the way in which industrial laws
have been hashed by lawyers, that unions are
inclined to view the whole process with a
cold eye and a tired feeling.

“S.S.” : King George reads a chapter of the
Bible every day. I can show you the cable
to prove it. Having kept this up for 30-
odd years, George has now read the good
book through about 10 times. Why con-
tinue? His Gracious should know the whole
thing from Genesis to Revelation, yet he
keeps on doing it. Plainly George V. has
the pretty general English opinion that
Rible-reading is a sort of penance, only to
be endured because it is less painful than
whipping one’s own back, and not so awk-
ward as dried peas in one’s boots.
“Genung” classi-
fies the Australian
kid :
I have taught school
in most parts of Vic-
toria (by the way, the
technical term tor
teaching is “running
a tannery”), and it
has been interesting
to study the effect en-
vironment has on nip-
pers. The greatest en-
joyment I have got
from my job was i n
the slum districts o f
Melbourne. The young-
sters, ever ready to
pull my leg out of its
sockets if I let them
get hold of it, were at
the same time exceed-
ingly quick to see any-
thing 1 had to show
them. Some of them
had a wonderful com-
mand of language, and
one or two were ex-
ceedingly expert with
an inkwell as a mis-
sile and me as a tar-
get. But it was a
pleasure to teach
them. In agricultural
districts they were
generally stodgy, re-
spectable and well-
behaved. They were
always smoodging to
the teacher, and be-
lieved the yarn about
George. Washington. In
grazing lands they
were stupid and docile
as sheep, lingering
long and languidly
over their lessons.
The most trying of
all were children i n
mining districts. Most
of them were “point-
ers,” and the rest
were “slacker s,”
cheeky as members of
Parliament and truth-
ful as Abo-liars. In
cow country they were
blasf; at 14. The
mingling with the
“cow squeezers” o n
their fathers’ farms
had given them an intimate knowledge of certain sub-
jects not included in the curriculum. But, apart from
this, they were cow-stupid—talked cow, smelt cow,
lived cow.
On top of repeated “strikes” of scholars
at having to attend overcrowded and dilapi-
dated schools in Victoria comes a piece of
cool neglect which should earn somebody the
sack. By the Amending Education Act of
1911 the State undertook to provide 200
scholarships, worth £l2 each for three years,
for State scholars, to be enjoyed at public
or approved private secondary or technical
schools or colleges; and Director Tate and
the National Council of Education have
more than once urged the Minister to give
the necessary authority to go ahead. Yet.
so far, not one penny has been voted, and
both Treasurer Watt and Education Minis-
ter Billson seem as void of information on
the matter as though they had been dead
when the Act was passed. The whole policy,
in fact, is in line with Toryism’s habitual
attitude towards education, as crystallised
by the late Bent: “It’s all going out and
nothing coming in; therefore it doesn’t
pay.” Besides, when the clever son of the
poor man has the same chance of superior
education as Moneybag’s offspring, the lat-

ter is likely to have to earn his crust with a
pick and shovel a good deal oftener than he
does at present, and with a good many
authorities that’s really why every progres-
sive step in the education of poor children is
delayed as long as possible.
SUMMER GOES MISSING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yesterday. . . .the southerly gale was blowing with
renewed vigor.— Daily paper.
The gale it whistles a dreary tune;
The fine sand flies on the wind-whipped dune ;
Summer has gone from the furrowed sea
And the white wave-teeth gleam savagely;
The black clouds, trailing their robes of rain,
Sail up like Grief from the south again,
And veil the rage of the troubled sea
That snarling runs like a pack set free.
There’s nothing doing on coastal bars,
Where king waves lift to the watching stars ;
The south-bound liners are charging through ;
The Summer boarder looks very blue,
For, lacking Summer, his life is vain ;
With nose pressed close to the streaming pane
He stands on watch, with a vacant stare,
And whistles a strange and dismal air.

To see each sea with a Christmas beard,
And hear the icy wind piping shrill
By wet-faced headland and sun-browned hill.

Are thick in the streets. Umbrellas black

and “Yarrum” and I will both be dust, and municipal

and woebegone, with the furtive all 0 a man
accustomed to adventures with dogs. He was ven-
turing nearer. After several signals of distress, and
with a propitiatory cough or two, he came within
range. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I stand sorely in
need of some refreshment, which I am willing to
earn.” “Want a job?” growled Williamson. “No,
no,” answered the weary fragment with some trepi-
dation, “but I will tell you what I will do. I will
preach you a very agreeable sermon for a bottle of
beer.” The suggestion offered divertisement, and
Weigall said “Done!” The waif and stray en-
trenched himself behind a large packing-case, ami
waded in. He preached an ordinary sort of second-
hand sermon, such as you might hear any Sunday,
giving our manifold sins and wickednesses the usual
three-minute dust-up. He attacked drink, and big-
amy, and wife-beating, giving each iniquity a brief
spar, and wound up with an eloquent peroration.
Then he took up his beer and bestowed himself
behind a tree. Everybody noticed a change in
Weigall. Previously he had been the hardest drinker,
as well as the most splenetic swearer of the bunch,
at Hawksnest. He had been credited with pasting
the missus with a shingle, too, and he was sudden
and quick in quarrel, and prompt to do evil. For
five weeks he was a moody and disgruntled wretch,
given much to solitary musings, sober, amenable to
discipline in the domestic circle, and guilty of
cavernous groaiiings in working hours. When it
was discovered that on three occasions he had
walked five miles to morning service at Piedisli, the
miners concluded that he- was very sick. Then came
a fine Saturday afternoon and an outbreak of man-
slaughter at the back of the hut. Ten men rushed
to quell the riot, and found Weigall and the weary
fragment entangled in argument. The wandering
minister had returned to Hawksnest to his own
undoing. The decadent preacher it was who was
making all the noise; Weigall was too full for
utterance and too busy working mischief all over
the hapless theologian to waste energy in superflu-
ous exclamation. When his mates tore Joseph off
his prey the ex-cleric was just a demoralised
bundle, the distinguishing feature of which was two
black eyes. “Lemme at him!” yelled Weigall.
“Don’t let him go!” he roared. “I’ll kill him!
I’ll break his blinded neck!” “Hold up, Jo,” said
Williamson. “What’s the pore bloke done to you?”
“What’s he done?” thundered Weigall. “What’s
he done? That’s the knock-kneed
bleeder what converted me!”
* * * *
“Genung”: A few years ago every Vic-
torian railway station was plastered with notices,
“Smoking strictly prohibited.” In Bendilarat lived
a white-whiskered old anti-tobacco crank,
who haunted the local railway station
looking for smokers. On finding one, he
would bear down upon him and demand
that he should put out his pipe at once
or he would be given in charge. This
went on for years. Then, one evening,
the nuisance saw a tubby, fashionably-
dressed man sauntering along, with a
cigar between his lips. Nothing pleased
old Whiskers more than tackling one of
the Upper Ten. He lined up to him.
“Don’t you know',” he said, “that smok-
ing is prohibited on railway stations.
Can’t you read! Put out that cigar at
once.” The smoker puffed and gazed ab-
stractedly ahead, as if he neither saw nor
heard. This infuriated old killjoy to such
an extent that he snatched the cigar from
the smoker’s lips, and threw it out on the
permanent way, right under the wheels of
an approaching train. Then he awaited
developments. But Shiny Hat smiled
blandly at him and turned away. Next
week every one of the offensive notice-
boards was taken down, and nobody
missed them except Old Nark, who went
home and died of a busted job. The
tubby man he had bearded was Tait, the
Commissioner of Railways. Now every-
body smokes who wants to. I guess old
Whiskers is smoking also.
“Vic”: Buchner, a scientist, is just back
from Barren Island in Bass Strait. Its people form
the last link with the Tasmanian aborigines. There
are only nine family groups, but they include 150
persons. The hard-living men who established them-
selves on this island went there for sealing, took Tas-
manian aboriginal women and settled down, Captain
Phil Thomas is nowadays the principal islander. He
is the son of another Captain Thomas and an abori-
ginal. Thomas, jun., married a half-caste, and one
of his sons has married a quadroon. A son of this
last union is very dark and a daughter very white.
As for living, Buchner mentions that one family of
five during the mutton-bird season regularly makes
about £l2O in six weeks. Some of the half-castes
are of a decidedly superior type, but others are in-
ferior, the result probably of descent from convicts of
a bad order. Tuberculosis is prevalent, and has
got worse of late, which is no doubt one reason why
the inhabitants show little attachment for the poor
place.
THE LAST SIXPENCE.
PRIMUS: "Sheep's head or chops!"
SECUNDUS: "Well , I'm for beer—there ain't no waste of bones in beer."
“Gouger”: It is a strange fact that the
mountain springs all give out more water in the
mornings than in the evenings. In tin sluicing, if
the only available water is from springs, the pressure
is always strong until about four o'clock in the after-
noon, when the water begins to slack out. Whether
the springs have a union, and refuse to work long
hours, I don't know. But anyhow, they “go easy”
from the early evening until daylight next shift.
THE TROUBLES OF A FLYING RUIN.
COLON EL (to unhappy recruit): “ Hi! Con-
found you, why don't you salute?”
“Aslew”: About the "Send it down,
Hughie” of the shearer and cocky (B. 14/11/’l2,
5/12/’l2). I heard the expression used first many
years ago by a blue nose A.B. on the ship Yarkand,
outward bound to Rangoon. We were in the dol-
drums, and everybody was waiting for a wash —
body and clothes —as was (and I suppose is) the
custom on the lime-juicer, with its “three quarts of
water, two for the cook.” I have since heard it in
different parts of Australia. Up Gunnedah way it
was, “Send it down, Jimmie.” Perhaps they referred
to James Pannikin, Esq.
“Yannatherra” : lie served his time fool-
ing about a provincial motor garage in England,
where he was initiated into the inner working (and
non-working) of petrol engines. Incidentally, he
drew seven whole bobs per week. The strain of
spending his screw undermined his constitution, so he
lit out for Australia to recuperate. Fifteen con-
secutive refusals in a similar number of Melbourne
garages were fast bringing on a relapse, when hi*
took on a job as generally useless to a cocky. Hf
was wise enough to pitch the gag that he was an
experienced man —line not specified. His champion
“wrong answer” to
date was when he
took the buggy to
the railway sta-
tion. He found
the nosebag on the
horse, and guessed
it was meant to
stay there. II e
managed to propel
a very surprised
moke about a mile,
in the course of
which the bag was
gradually jolted
empty. The climax
came when the
empty bag blew
across the horse's
eyes. The embryo
groom climbed
down t o investi-
gate the carburet-
ter of that horse.
He discovered and
removed the empty
bag, remarking to
a bystander, “Well, of all tlie asses! They’ve sent
me up with only enough fuel to do half the trip.”
“Yarrum”: If “Chump” can find that 1
made use of the words he attributes to me (B.
5/12/’l2), I’ll shout a trip (first-class) for him from
Sydney to Narrandera, and there I’ll show him the
wood ducks assisting their young ones back to the
nest in the way I described. On the other hand, if
he fails, I shall expect him to part up for me; and
I think that is a fair go. He speaks of me, too,
as a Clontarf ornithologist. In answer to that reck-
less charge, I must plead guilty to having been to
Clontarf only once in my life, and thereby hangs a
tale. I shall tell him all about it on the way to
Narrandera, when I hope to be his guest. His other
charges are about as cranky as the first I dealt with ;
so that I shall leave them out if he doesn’t mind. In
conclusion, I would like to ask “Chump” if he knows
what Carlyle once said about the man who mis-
quotes.

FIXING THEIR RELATIONS.
MRS. JAMEISON-SYMTHE (to the maid in her
first job): “You mustn't keep on calling
me Mrs. Jameison-Symlhe every time you
address me. You should say, ‘ Yes, mum)
or ‘No, mum !'”
SALLY: “Oh, I can't call yer mum, bee os that’s
wot I calls me mother. But i’ll call yer
auntie, if yer like!"
“He Toka”: The crabs at Yamba(N.S.W.)
know a thing or two. Saw one crawl up and wait
for an oyster to open. As soon as the lid was
raised the crab pushed in a small stone quickly.
Then he spat on his hands, and started to drag the
tenant from the premises. And I’m nearly sure he
didn’t do. it merely to give the tenant a pleasant
change of air.
“Stohr Ruddell”: The youthful country
police do their share towards blocking decentralisa-
tion. the swag is, to an extent, a necessary evil
with the man who makes to the bush for work;
but the raw young recruit, fresh from the barracks,
marks it as the insignia of the loafer and the beer-
chewer. He (with great emphasis) will put it
down. In the small river towns which the habitual
do-nothings, as well as the honest, swag-humping
work-seekers, make their retreat, the ignorance of
young law-an’-order is a menace. He is let loose
amongst 500 or 600 people with his new uniform,
and he has been told or led to believe that he's there
to do things. How can he show what he has done
unless he produces a lengthy charge-sheet? If, how-
ever, he dashes out in an indiscriminate pursuit of
lawbreakers, more especially as regards sobriety, he
is pulled up immediately he lays hand on ’ the
wavering miller, the shire secretary, or the butcher
who is also the Jay Pay. If he pinches the son’
brother, aged parent, or second-cousin of any of the
aforesaid, he is publicly decapitated—or moved. So
he falls back in haste on the man with the swag,
who is an easy win, a walk-over, and a long-odds
chance. The bagman comes from anywhere, and has
no idea where he will spend Eternity. He may
have been chopping hardwood timber for eight or
10 months, and now he wants relief. According to
his temperament and the disposition of Bung and
Bung’s sparrers, he grows joyful, voluble or fight-
able. In any case, he is hilarious. At the summit
of his magnificence he is rudely grabbed by a lean
young man in civilian dress. He cleaves the air
with his hands in protest, and shocks the ears of
people within hearing. Eventually he is overpow-
ered through the commendable assistance of the
local banker and the boy who peels spuds at the
pub, and next day he is sent along for three months
in default of an impossible fine. That town gets a
black mark in the Bauman's Gazette, and sends
others to blew their cneque in Sydney, “where a
man can bash the old woman cheaper.” The irony
of it all is that the “dinkum” tramp—the übiquit-
ous, useless beer-sparrer and borrower of threepenny-
bits—never becomes over-jovful, fightable or volu-
ble When he can’t get any more, he toddles off
to his “knot,” and he worries the Wowser only when
he places an exorbitant value on his labor.
Binghi’s census, taken in N. S. Wales
last year, discloses that he numbered 7329 all told.
Of these only 2076 were full-bloods (9.35 males, 564
females and 577 children). The total showed an
increase of 372 abos. over the figures of 1910,
although the difficulties of catching Binghi to count
him are so great that nothing is more than approxi-
mate. The first round-up took place in 1882, when
the full-bloods numbered 6540, or 4464 more than
last year. In the same 19-year period the half-
castes increased by 2874. Counting full-bloods and
half-castes, there has been a falling away of 1590.

“L.J.P.”; The line that separates “the in-
side” from the Never-Never retreats fast towards
the setting sun. Not so many years
ago it was commonly supposed to be
somewhere about the Bogan or
Bourke; but to-day, from an Outback
point of view, those places are well
within the suburban area, while the
same remark applies to the Warrego,
Barcoo and the Thompson. The line
has anchored in turn at all of those
centres; but, with the coming of rail-
roads and population—especially that
population which wears tan boots and
smokes cigarettes—-it invariably rolls
up its swag and shifts further out.
Even away back on the Diamantina,
with its traditions of rough-living and
hard-drinking, a distinct air of re-
spectability commences to pervade the
atmosphere. Telephones and motors
have annihilated distance, and it is
now quite the thing to see squatters
and managers viewing the scenery and
admiring their woollies from up-to-
date cars. Another thing that has in-
vaded the West —out as far, almost,
as there is any West—is the gramo-
phone. There is hardly a shanty, way-
side pub or accommodation house of
any pretension whatever but has one
of these; and Mulga Jim can now
knock down his cheque to the accom-
paniment of the most popular songs
of the day, sung by the world’s lead-
ing vocalists. Furthermore, he has
the additional privilege, should any
one of them offend his refined taste, of
saying blankv and turning on another.
So the old order giveth place to the
new, and it would be hard to say
where Outback really does begin now.
Personally, I have a hazy notion that it starts from
somewhere about Boulia, where snake-juice and other
liquid refreshments cost the weary wayfarer a bob
a time, and where (on my oath) a chap asked me
only a few months ago whether the Boer war was
over yet.

“A.McI.”: Hugh McColl, the father of
irrigation in Victoria, had nothing to do with the
origin of the bush saying, “Send it down, Hughie!”
when rain is falling or is wanted. I heard it first
as a boy in the navy in ’B5, and about once a week
for 14 years after. “Old Hughie” would be “hav-
ing a go” when it rained a bit out of the ordinary ;
and when it meant “pipe down” for a day or two
(which it often did on the West Indies station)
we would sing “good o 1 e Hughie,” parodying
Mother Shipton. I have also heard “Elijah” spoken
of in the same manner, and I think it probable that
“Hughie” is a corruption of ’Lijali.
‘Hamer”: A new imported curse, or sus-
pected curse, has been discovered by the Wagga
(N.S.W.) Municipal Council. The silver poplar
(Populus Alba) is accused of causing hay fever, and
inciting the populace to consumption, and the coun-
cillors intend to have the suspected vegetables re-
moved. At certain times in the year the silver pop-
lar casts off showers of fluffy stuff, which float into
Wagga’s lungs, and are supposed to cause the ills
of which the river town says it has far too much.
Its guilt has not yet been definitely settled, but the
trees are to go on the off-chance.
BREAKING HIMSELF
INTO IT.
“’IM ride! An' 'e 'said 'e
'adn't been off a 'orse
fer years.”
“ Well, he's been or, this
one nine times already."
“Drummer”: Re “6-tooth’s” par. (R.
5/12/’l2). As one who toils at the sheep-barbering
profession, I push this down the shoot. I have never
seen a sheep’s eye gouged out, and very rarely a
jugular cut. Anyway, a dissatisfied majority on a
wet-sheep question don’t organise a “flying cut” ; and
if they did, and “rose” a bit, they would be more
likely to miss eyes and jugulars, and would lift less
pelt. A deliberate eye-gouger or jugular-cutter would
be firmly told about it, and if the boss missed him,
the other barbers would say nasty things, not in news-
papers, but to his face. That’s my experience. If
“6-tooth” wants to air humanitarian views, let him
tell truths about those who do not crutch when neces-
sary, but prefer to wait for the shearer to do two
jobs for one job’s price. Strong men turn sick and
faint at their work in flyblown sheep. They growl
for their own sake. Now let “6-tooth” roar for the
agony-carrying sheep’s sake. They need a lot of
friends in their purgatory.
A FINANCIAL OPERATION.
1ST DOCTOR: “ Guess what I got out of old
Merino’s appendix?”
2ND DITTO: “Oh, about a couple of hundred.”
“Yam” : I can’t say what sort of soup the
tortoise makes, but I know he makes a first-class
fool. Last week I saw scores of him stuck against
wire-netting fences along the Mitta Mitta. During
recent flopds they left their haunts, and are now
making back to them over dry land. But when they
strike the netting they will not retreat, nor will
they turn to right or left. They just wait for the
fence to shift, and when it doesn’t shift, they
perish.
-Fred Muir” : Victor Hugo’s description
Of the octopus (B. 21/11/-12) was only an effort
* l ? a S lnatlon based on hearsay, for the beast is
not known on the coasts of France, and I never
heard that Hugo had travelled. The octo. does not
lobsters "b ?' Z*™ °/ feed exclusivel y on crabs and
IvillfJtVl frequents, mostly, open mud flats, and
"ill tackle anything with life in it. I have caught
l °2ft nS tolfi h ft m Wi f a Spread 0f tentacl es of from
-ft. to 16ft., and an elephant could not escape if
the sea devil had him by the leg with one or twc
of his arms and was fast to a rock or pile with the
°^ lerS ' T} ' e b oc] f of an octopus with a stretch of,
say, 14ft (and that is not one of the largest) would
be about _,t. in length by about Ift. broad; its
shape m that of a spider with no neck. The head
is stiffer than the body, the latter being more like
an india-rubber bag. The eyes are the most devil-
ishly cruel, malignant and wicked of all creation,
and there is nothing “glassy” or dead about them.
An infuriated tiger’s or shark’s eyes are kindness
itself compared with the eyes of the octopus. • We
used to get him on a fairly simple proposition.
Locating him in 3ft. or 4ft. of water, we would
keep him moving with oar-prods until shal-
lower water was reached. Then we would tease him
to madness with the oar until lie seized it and
hung on like a herd of bulldogs. Then we towed
him ashore and deposited him under a young moun-
tain of rocks near high-water mark. The next high
tide drowned him. No ordinary knife would cut
any part of him. That was in Southern Maori land,
where the big fellows hang out. Outside that, I
am personally acquainted only with the N. S.
Wales octopus. He is a mere plaything,
“Niuafo’ou” blows in from Tonga:—
How these tourists get their limbs pulled on the
mailboats in the Pacific, and what lovely things
Wwritei to cheer up the lonely traders in the
south Seas! Head a specially interesting article by
a lady in a Sydney paper recently. We, at Niuafo’ou,
were greatly touched to be called “the few solitary
ones for whom the eyes. grow misty and the throat
contracts, but we would have been better pleased
if the lady had mentioned the exact position of the
stone figures of the woman, with the child on her
back and the pig at her heels. We’ve raked right
across the five miles of island without finding them.
And the malu bird? The lady says it is “about
the size of a sparrow,” and, in arranging its nest
digs a perpendicular hole about eight to 10 feet ■
then it digs horizontally for the same distance: it
then lays its eggs, 100 in number.” in other words
a four-ounce bird lays 12-ounce eggs to the extent of
about a cwt! Shades of a Yankee poultry farm
advt. ! We had the impression that the bird was
the size of a large pigeon, and that its eggs were
nearly the same in body as a turkey’s. We have
found 30 or 40 eggs in the community-burrows in the
sand, but we had hitherto credited 30 or 40 hens
with the output. Perhaps we were wrong. Most of
us have been only 10 years or so on this dot, any-
way, and can’t expect to know as much as the glad
boys and girls on the mailboats.
“Crusoe” : There are about 800 people on
King Island in Bass Strait, nearly all of-them self-
important cockies from Britain or adjacent Vic-
toria. As. a type they are quite distinct from that
of the mainland. A stranger finds it practically im-
possible to make friends with them. In fact, unless
he pals up with the barman in the island’s solitary
pub he is likely to remain a stranger until he de-
parts. There 'is none of that open-banded hospi-
tality which is a feature of some parts of Aus-
tralia s agricultural and pastoral country—none of
the genuine, cheery welcome that characterises the
big Australian. Dunno the cause, unless it is
the isolation. Sometimes there is no news from the
outside world for a fortnight at a stretch, and the
oil sort of dries on the hinges of the intellect.
That’s the only explanation I can offer, and it is
not advanced so much by way of explanation as by
way of excuse.
THE HUS[?] AT PIKER'S PUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A hush prevailed at Piker s pub. A strange religious
glow
Suffused the bar, and played across each brown
and bearded face,
And smoothed away the lines of care, the scars of
old disgrace ;
It only showed the excellence (or what was left to
show)
Of all that was commendable uncounted years ago.
Outside, the night was strewn with stars. A nmlga-
scented breeze
Awoke the sullen leaves from sleep on each scrub
silhouette,
And stirred the dust, as kisses stir a slumberous
coquette,
From where it lay throughout the calm of daylight's
languid ease.
Indoors, the Girl from Sydney-side no longer
strummed the keys.
The very bottles on the shelves became as holy things ;
The glasses on the counter like Byzantine sculp-
tures gleamed,
And from cathedral windows might their opal
tints have streamed ;
The bar-room lithographs, that showed how beggar
maids met kings,
Grew not unlike the Angelos the hook-nosed hawker
brings.
ihe painted girl from Sydney-side became demure
and shy ;
Her ample bosom heaved beneath her amulet of
paste—
But it were sacrilege to look, or her red kisses
taste.
Her perfumed presence was a thing the worst might
sanctify,
And when she passed it seemed as though Madonna
ventured by.
Had deep repentance liapt along to Piker’s lone
hotel ?
Had ev'ry sinner seen his faults, and turned a
brand-new leaf?
Had ancient Folly vanished like the Desert’s tented
thief?
At last had \\ isdom, long-deferred, vouchsafed its
lesson well?
Had Conscience, with the still small voice, invaded
each man’s hell ?
Would Piker close his shutters and incontinently
flee—
Explaining that contingencies of trade had forced
him to,
And adding that denial is a thing men over-do?
Alas! that indications with the truth should dis-
agree—
That holy calm, was but the hush that comes before
the spree !

with a knowledge of cooking is few in

F. J Thomas, general manager of the
Newcastle and Hunter River S. N Co has
been appointed a director. Thomas joined
the old Hunter River Co. in 1860, and
wRWv. chief” when it amalgamated
with the Newcastle Co. in 1892. Advancing
years has led him to exchange his old job
tor the more ornamental billet of director
, the co., whose solid position is verv
largely due to his skilful trick at the wheel.
William Durrant, a baronet, whose ances-
wui-are !?: ld X° have reached England with
William the Conqueror, has died at North
Harbor, Sydney, aged 73 years. He was an
jton boy, and had at one time a commission
as lieutenant in the 15th Foot. Coming to
Australia in 1862 as a consumptive, he got
lid of the affliction, dabbled in sugar and in
sheep, and at one time edited a country
newspaper. In 1875 his elder brother died
without issue, and he thus came in for the
title, in which he is succeeded by a son —a
clerk in a shipping firm’s service.

c.°“e T Tax and State Guaranteed Advances
• iT \ S Ministers are notorious for odd
jobs), who looked in at Sydney and Mel-
bourne the other day on his way to Fog-
land, is a South Australian by birth, and.
since the time of W. P. Reeves, one of the
bitterest political fighters the Rickettv Isles
has known. He made his entry to politics
there in 1887, when he blew Robert Stout,
then 3 -Premier (Vogel was the other 1),
out of a Dunedin seat, to the vast surprise
of the inhabitants, more especially Stout.
I rom that date Allen was one of the serangs

Allen will be 58 years of age in February,

said he “thought it was the duty of every

der some aid to his fellows if he could.” So
he is on his way to the Great Pawnshop to

to help him to the pawnshop.

THE EVICTED: “Where to now , Gardner?
Govment ’Ouse?"
From the Second-Oldest Inhabitant:—
A wedding of some Australian interest was cele-
brated the other day in Melbourne. The bride was
a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Mitchell, of Fan-
court, East Melbourne, and granddaughter of William
Henry Fancourt Mitchell, a man of some note in the
early history of Victoria. This Mitchell was the
son of the vicar of St. Mary’s and All Saints’,
Leicester (Eng.), and chaplain to, the Duke of York.
He arrived in Van Diemen’s Land young, and for a
time • was _ Acting Colonial Secretary. Crossing to
Port Phillip, about the year 1840, he “squatted”
in the Kvneton district. When the gold rushes broke
out Governor Latrobe asked him to take on the job
of Chief Commissioner of Police, with almost un-
limited powers. He introduced the cadet system, by
promising young fellows commissions and handsome
uniforms and plenty of bushranger-hunting and escort
duty. Edmund Fosbery, ex-inspector General of
N. S. Wales police, was one of those he snared. Pre-
sently Mitchell went to England on leave, and Capt.
McMahon succeeded him. Returning to the colony,
Mitchell entered politics, became a member of the
Leg. Council, and sat there till his death; in later
days he was President. The mother of the bride
is a Geelong Morrison. The bridegroom is a young
Irishman, son of Captain Armit, of Castle Jordan,
King’s County.
Concerning an uncommon art collector:—
The art collection of the late George MacCulloch
is to be sold in London next March. The collection
is a notable instance of how Art can be made to pay
good dividends. MacCulloch was the bachelor man-
ager of Mount Gipps sheep station for his uncle,
James MacCulloch, a former Premier of Victoria.
Mount Gipps includes Broken Hill, and Geo«ge was
there when that uninteresting knoll was first found
to contain silver-lead. He had received a fair educa-
tion in Glasgow, having intended to be a chemist
and druggist. Being the station boss, he naturally
became the chairman of the Broken Hill syndicate,
and he added share to share. (There were only 16
altogether.) When his big fortune was assured, he
drifted to London, bought a freehold near the Im-
perial Institute, and built a house designed to hold
pictures. The dining-room was octagonal, the vista
through each of the eight arches ending in a master-
piece hanging on the wall of the adjacent room.
Wherever one sat at table an art treasure met the
eye. At dinner MacCulloch used to entertain mem-
bers of the Royal Academy, and from them learnt not
only the argot of Art, but the practical business
points of buying pictures, and, incidentally, selling
them. He had a fine sense of coming greatness in a
rising artist, and always laid in a stock of cheap
pictures by one whom he judged was on the point
of arriving. Also he watched the setting suns, and
often bought their best works as they were nearing
sunset. For instance, at Christie and Manson’s pic-
ture sale room, one afternoon, he bought five Vicat
Coles at what looked like high prices. But Cole was
dead within a week, and his works doubled in value.
MacCulloch had casually learned that the artist was
ill. During the last years of his life this shrewd
art-dealer made a lot of money buying and selling
pictures, and, naturally, since his “coming” men
didn t always arrive, his collection is streaky. Among
some poor things it includes the very best specimens
of modren art.

_A cheerful innovation was disclosed in the
will of Robert Wilson, late of Mystic Park,
near Kerang (Vic.), who lived lonely and
unmarried till he reached the age of 84,
and left £10,763, mostly real estate. His
only near relative was a nephew, “last
known of at Northumberland, England,” to
whom he bequeathed 762 acres of fairish
land. The remainder, some 2600 acres, he
parcelled out among his half-dozen long-time
tenants.
“B.” on an unsteady monarch :
Tim Coghlan’s hold on the N.S.W. Agent-General’s
office has nearly always been precarious. Indeed, since
he earned his first pound in N.S.W. Government em-
ploy, he has always been in dread of the Irishman’s
“rise,” and must often have wished he had stuck to
engineering. It was Dibbs, Jennings and Dailey who
encouraged the keen, clear-headed young outsider to
jump into the Civil Service; and simply because
these did it, Parkes vowed that he would fire him
out. So Tim put his head down and did the work
of three men, and Parkes, when he gained authority,
filed his vow with his lOU’s, and naturally forgot all
about it. But Tim was still a-tremble. When Reid
took the Premiership Tim started off to do the work
of four men, and, to his surprise, Yes-No loaded him
with favors. These culminated in the mission to
London, which afterwards led to the Agent-General-
ship. Tim, however, still rolled in the pickle of fear.
Constitutionally, he is a man who looks ahead, and
tries to secure a future, but the winds of political
change turned his sails inside out and his plans up-
side down. McGowen last week informed reporters
that he has been pestering the Government to learn
what is to become of him at the end of March ; but
McGowen’s Government is in such a stew that it
hardly knows where itself will be at the end of
March. Therefore, something temporary has again
been rigged up.
The Oldest Inhabitant winds up the Fawk-
ner reminiscences :
“W.” (B. 21/11/’l2) says that Johnny Fawkner’s
sea sickness,” which prevented the completion of his
trip in the Enterprise, on the little vessel’s first visit
to the Yarra, was occasioned by the fact that his
creditors wouldn’t let him leave. If it were so, it
would be at the instigation of Batman and his famous
syndicate—a powerful combination in the days when
Governor Arthur did pretty well as he liked. One
of Arthur’s nephews was a member of the syndicate,
and quite likely was a mere dummy for his uncle, the
Governor. That Fawkner could pay 20s. in the £
no one who _ knows his circumstances can doubt.
Fawkner, besides having orchard property, kept the
Cornwall Inn at Launceston, was a newspaper pro-
prietor, pleaded in the court known as “The Little-
(f, m0 H debts, etc.), and was constantly mixing
with the public. It was to the Cornwall that John
Batman went to make his boast of being the “largest
landowner in the world,” referring to his supposed
purchase of the Yarra territory from the natives. It
was just the sort of thing that Batman would do
it he knew (as no doubt he did) that Fawkner had
announced all along his intention to settle on the
Yarra. As a reading man (and that he was a reader
has never been doubted) Fawkner knew of Grimes’s
survey, and availed himself of the knowledge Fawk-
ner s services have been belittled by James Bonwick,
the early Vic. historian. But Bonwick never liked
1- awkner—probably, I think, because the latter
called public attention to the alleged lax performance
of some of Mr. Bonwick’s duties as a public school
inspector. Yet even Bonwick can't destroy Fawk-
ner s claim that his money and h'is men built the
first house m Melbourne, and that his vessel, the
Enterprise, was the first to enter the basin of the
dented Head Batman s men were dreaming at In-

Marion Phillips, M.A., D.Sc., a Mel-

Kensington, London, having been returned

tions last month.
Carlyle Valentine Ilosswood Johnston
the Labor candidate for Blaynev (N.S W )
in opposition to Beeby, is satisfied as a
general thing to travel light as Carl John-
ston, and under that style has become fairly
well known in the N.S.YV. Labor movement
fie is a young man (about 30, which is
young as politicians go) of apparent possi-
bilities lie was one of the Labor candi-
dates tor Belmore in the recent Sydney
municipal elections, and though unsuccessful
be did good work. He is well known in the
Llayney electorate, having lived there or
thereabouts most of his life. He has an
absorbent brain for political points and a
share of platform ability ; also a sufficientlv
taking way with him off stage to attract
the fancy of electors who bother about men
rather than matters. Until recently John-
ston was at Portland (N.S.W.) as secretary
ot the Cement Workers’ Union. He left
that job to come to Sydney with a view to
qualifying for the horsehaired profession.
Ben Rounsevell, who was Treas-
urer of S. Aus. as much as 32

beard in half a dozen subsequent
Ministries, was induced to come
out of a more or less Rip Van
Winkle retirement the other day
and become Mayor of Glenelg. The
vigorous old “sport” passed his 70th
milestone a few months ago: but
he lives in a State where the sep-
tuagenarian is liable to be a mere
youngster. Until the other day
there was an Adelaide man in the
quarry business who signed himself
(say) William Brown, junior
though he was 70-odd. Then his
father died and he had to drop the
tag.
Delegates to the recent International Art
Congress at Dresden—there were 2500 of
them wore colored badges to indicate what
language they spoke. White represented
German; red, French; and blue, English—
mese being the Congress languages. A. R
Coffey, the N.S.W. Education Department’s
delegate, pinned a good advertisement for
his country to his lapel, in the shape of a
tricolored badge, whereby he insinuated his
readiness to commune concerning Art with
all comers. Incidentally, he struck a iob.
Professor Montfort, a Belgian, expounded
in French, and Coffey translated the exposi-
tion from memory into good Australian for
the behoof of the English and Americans.
Thereafter, whenever a Belgian, French
fewede or Russian let his eloquence loose in
French, or something, the delighted presi-
dent would announce: “Mr. Coffey, the dele-
gate from Australia, will now give the
address in English,” and Monsieur Coffev
came to the rescue every time, amid a tor-
nado of Vives!” “Hochs!” “Hurravs

THE HARD CASE OF J. JONES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The question was asked in the House of Repre-
sentatives, yesterday, whether consideration had been
given to the compulsory and efficient training of
young women in first aid and hospital training to
enable them to render service to their country in
time of war? The reply was that such training" was
not considered necessary. —Daily paver.
Jones as a youthling very raw
Went out to earn his daily bread ;
Each hour Life hit him on the jaw
And drove some sense into his head.
Large men and stout all yelled at Jones;
He jumped some twenty times each day ;
He wrote and ran, he answered ’phones,
And drew his microscopic pay.
Black murder surged in his young heart;
He dreamed of bosses shot and hung;
But still he played his humble part,
And learnt his work, and held his tongue.
And so it came to pass, the lad,
Compelled by Want to train for Life,
One day a place of honor had
And took a pretty girl to wife.
Now Mrs. Jones had lived at home,
And never worked for strangers who
Could stamp and roar, and rage and foam,
If things were not attended to.
She “ordered” with a regal air,
But hated orders to receive ;
Advice she “simply couldn’t bear”;
She never murmured “By your leave 1”
Then she was ignorantly proud,
Intolerant and snobbish, too ;
She patronised the vulgar crowd
And worshipped blood she thought was blue.
She sewed “a bit” and cooked “a bit” ;
Not well enough to make a dress,
Or coax plain-living folk to sit
Around the joint Jones used to bless.
She was an amateurish wife,
And never wholly learnt her part;
He bore with her right through his life
Because she’d won his simple heart.
War shakes the Jonesian home each day,
Most standing armies age in peace;
But train her in a homely way,
And war upon the hearth will cease.

The erratic figures in the column devoted to profits
suggest that the co. plays a good game of poker in
the smoke-room, and occasionally has the luck to
strike a millionaire. It looks like that, but probably
there is another explanation. The co. has 69 ships,
and ships have a habit of wearing out. As soon,
therefore, as a ship is built and starts to work, the
management says: “Part of your earnings in excess
of actual working expenses isn’t profit. You will be
a practically valueless hulk in 25 years. Therefore,
besides earning us interest, you must earn us enough
in 25 years to pay us back what it cost to build you,
so that we may then build another ship to take your
place.” Some cos. show that amortization, or depre-
ciation, or repairs and replacement fund; this co.
doesn’t. Supposing last year the co. set aside 21
p.c. of the book value of its ships—that is, £33,923"
Then, instead of showing that sum first as profit and
then as an addition to reserves, the co. simply
deducts the sum from the net profits exhibited in
the P. and L. account, and either spends the money
on some new asset, which it doesn’t show in the
balance-sheet at all, or writes down an existing asset
by that amount. But, though the co. has put by
(say) 21 p.c. (or it may be 4 p.c. for all this paper
knows), it presently that, through extra care or
extra good luck or something, the ships have lasted
longer than was calculated. Then the depreciation
fund, of course, becomes bloated —in other words, a
greater provision has been made out of profits for
renewals and replacements than is necessary. When
that happens it is allowable to transfer some of the
unwanted surplus back to profits ; and that, no doubt,
is what has been done two or three times in the
co.’s history.
But let’s try to get some idea of the provision
which is being made now. For, plainly, the real
position depends a very great deal upon that. For
instance, if a co. didn’t lay by enough revenue to
make replacements, the time would inevitably come
when, having claimed and probably paid away more
profits than it had really made, it would have to go
to the shareholders for more capital to make neces-
sary replacements. On the other hand, if it socks
away too much it may be able to disgorge now and
then, just as this co. has done. The handiest way of
socking away profit is by putting it into ship pro-
perty which doesn’t figure in the balance-sheet. Now,
this is the position (stated only approximately for
some years in the middle of the table) :

In 1906 the fleet was 112,853 tons, and the value
set on it was about £8 9s. per ton. To-day the
figures have gone up to 197,119 tons and the value
to £1,356,944, which works out at only £6 17s. 6d.
per ton. Or put it this way. In the past six years
74,266 tons have been added to the fleet, while the
book value of the fleet has been increased by only
£403,458. Assuming that the new shipping has cost
only £lO a ton (and you can’t buy a 5000-ton ship
for £50,000), then £339,202 has been provided to-
wards the cost out of profits. That is to say, that
is the amount of profit put by into a depreciation
fund, and thence diverted to this purpose of replac-
ing ships, in the past six years. The figures must
not, however, be taken as absolute; for there is room
for some error on account of the variable tonnage
of new ships building, and not all paid for perhaps,
though included in the total tonnage. But this
should, not throw the figures far out.
From the foregoing it looks as though the co. not
only makes very ample provision against wear and
tear, but something besides. Further evidences of its
wonderfully sound position can be got from this :

But things can’t go on improving in looks like that.
In the past 10 years nearly £25,000 of profit on sales
has been added to reserves. This money is, however,
leally not profit at all, but is merely capital previ-
ously written off as lost. The society didn’t get into
quite as bad a mess as a good manv others; never-
theless, after several years spent mainly in the under-
business, it found in 1898 that things stood
somewhat as follows: Assets (mostly foreclosures and
advances) £IBO 8 76 ; estimated real value of the
lot, £.118,151 ; shrinkage, £62,725. To make good
shrinkage, which represented the hot-air
boom, the co. decided to write off two-
hlths of the capital. This was more than the valua-
tion called for, and allowed £10,532 to go to a
reserve fund, to provide for anv further diminution
ot values. But there wasn’t any further shrinkage.
On the contrary, Victoria steadily got over the sick-
ness caused by the explosion of its borrowing bubble
and good seasons and brisk trade went on adding
I’tt! o by little to property values. As the society
sold the old assets it made a profit on them—that is
made less loss than it had provided for in
iB9B.
But the old written-down properties are almost all
gone now. This next table shows, amonest other
things, how the foreclosures have been realised:—
„ . 1900. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912.

Other assets 5,907 1,720 563 4,595 152
Thus only £1772 of properties now remain in
possession. But that doesn’t mean that the profits
on sales which have so helped the reserves will now
suddenly peter out. Profits have only been taken
into account as the actual cash has been handled ; and
as most of the sales are no doubt on time payment,
money will continue to come in for a while. But
if the revenue from this source is doomed, the new
business should continue to bring in something
pleasant. Not, of course, that the advances or the
profit from advances can be expected to go on moving
ahead at the recent rate, because the sale of Dm old
assets on terms has bloated those figures. Still, the
society has clearly held on to a nice, profitable con-
nection ; and as long as it has made its advances on a
nrudent basis, the fine size of its reserves in propor-
tion to capital ought: to insure for it an exceptionally
good rate of dividend—exceptionally' good from the
building-society point of view, that is.

This co. has been a disappointment. Most that cater
for the public’s entertainment are. There is no last-
ing quality in them. The public goes mad over
ping-pong to-day, and to-morrow forgets all about the
insanity. Wonderland booms this month, and tramk
burst with the crowds that want to reach its bulging
gates; to-morrow it is an abandoned desert. Of
course, the showman invariably says to the backer
he’s angling for: “Oh, yes, that’s true; but ours is
the exception. Ours isn't a craze or a fad. Ours has
come to stay, like cricket and football and
the theatre.” _ This was told concerning ice-
skating. Hadn’t people been skating in “the
Old Country” beyond the memory of man?
Unfortunately for investors in the scheme, what the
Old Country could do without charge in the open the
new country wasn’t prepared to pay big money to
do within walls. For a few weeks it was a modified
craze; after that it was left pretty strictly to Alger-
non and Ermyntrude. And since Alg. and Erm. don’t
occur in very large numbers, the co. presently de-
cided that it would have to, so to speak, join them
in partnership with cold mutton and frozen . lamb.
This paper can’t swear to it, but it suspects that the
net revenue from the skaters doesn’t now compare
with that from freezing, cold storage and the sale of
ice. The enlarged works are capable of handling
15,000 carcases a week for export. In fact, the co.
puts the skating part of the business in this offhand
way: “A satisfactory lease of the Glaciarium Hall
has been entered into for a fixed term of three years,
with the right to the co. to resume the same for its
skating season in each year.”
. The paid capital is £29,500. This includes £SOOO
in 7| p.c. pref. shares, issued when the co. found
that it would have to find some other ways of making
money besides ice-skating. The directors would have
been glad of still more capital, but were presently
content to raise £12,500 on mortgage at 5 p.c.
Still, so much money has had to go out, in conse-
quence of the co. having changed its character, that
the finances are not even now very easy ; apart from
the mortgage, liabilities (including overdraft) run to
£4537, an increase of £9ll during the year, not-
withstanding the current profit. Plainly the co
having gone into other lines, the past is no guide to
the future. The business it is now in, though bound
to be irregular, is one which is likely to give very
good profits at times. That, anyhow, has been the
experience of the few already in it.

The apparent slump in the last half-year’s profit is
due to the payment of a bonus of £4ll to the staff
lhe co. is gradually calling up its capital. Last
half-year when there was a bonus of Is. per share
a call of the same amount was made. This took
the shares up to 12s. paid, leaving them liable for
another £1 18s. The shareholders’ risks are not,
however, appalling. Certainly the management is
liable to misread the. instructions of a client and
thus fall disastrously into the soup; but such cases
oc ?’i 1 ’ Z rare ly- To add to its comparative
safety it hasn t a penny of other people’s money at
risk, . while its own funds are invested in Perth
premises (£12,400), public securities (£4050),
and . mortgages and advances (£11,227). Interest
earnings last half-year produced £1241. which was
enough to pay 20 p.c. p.a. on the capital. Of course
the revenue from rent includes the charge made
a s amst f-he co. for the use of its own premises;
still probably somebody else would pay as much if
this co. went out. The net value of' the trust es-
tates m hand five years ago was £501,355; now
it is £1,528,517. And the continued growth of
the business done by trust offices seems just about
as certain as anything can be. They bring a special
knowledge to a business mostly transacted hitherto
by amateurs, and they give a guarantee that they
won’t disappear with the widow’s mite. Also, a
very important point, they don’t cease to exist
just because someone or two persons die; and that
is the trouble one is always bumping up against
in connection with the personal trustee, involving
an alteration of the will or other document if the
person who made it happens to be alive, or an appli-
cation to the court if he happens to have set sail for
other kingdoms.

The profit for the year was really a bit more than
that, but the S. Aus. Taxation Commissioner insisted
on the co. paying income (ax on the premiums col-
lected on the new issue of shares made in 1911.
That raises a nice point. Should those premiums be
liable for income tax any more than the new capital
itself? It is, for one reason, certainly undesirable
that premiums should be taxed; reserves are such
good things that no excuse should be given a co.
for neglecting to ask a premium for shares when it
can be got. Certainly, this money is generally liable
to be later on distributed among shareholders. It
shouldn’t be, but in most cases it is, though, hap-
pily, instances where divs. are paid out of a pre-
mium reserve are exceedingly rare. And, anyhow,
when it is done it simply amounts, in most cases, to
taking money out of one pocket and putting it back
into the same man’s other pocket. In other words,
even in such a case the “dividend” so far as it is
ever paid out of a premium reserve isn’t income ; it
is only return of capital. On the whole, then, there
seems to be much more to be said against regarding
premium capital as income than can be said in its
favor. Indeed, one object of the good accountant is
to prevent it being regarded as income; he wants
it recognised as an insurance fund, provided not out
ot profits, but out of the shareholders’ own pockets
and designed to protect (1) the co.’s creditors; (2)
the shareholders’ capital proper. Before to-day the
b. Aus. Taxation Department has demanded a tax
(in the Wallaroo and Moonta case) which was un-
doubtedly calculated to encourage improvidence and
bad accountancy; and it looks to have done much
the same in the present case.
This co. had the S. Australian field to itself for
many years, until a couple of the big pastoral-agency
cos. decided to float separate small concerns to look
after the dead man’s money. Such rivals will not
however, do much harm. There is plenty of trustee
work for them all to do. What is needed is a
wider recognition of their special value, and it is a
pretty _ tough job for one small co. to do all the
preaching necessary. Still, one can’t complain of the
progress. This shows the amount of trust funds in
the co. s control at various dates:—

In handling the trust estate, the private trustee puts
up no guarantee that he won’t swindle the estate
or be guilty of a disastrous misreading of his in-
structions. This co. puts up a guarantee to the
extent of its capital (£22,850) and its reserves;
and if they arc not sufficient, shareholders—a very
solid lot—are liable. for £52,500 in calls. This
guarantee fund (capital and reserves) is in cash
public securities, advances to estates and real pro-
perty, and the interest earnings alone ( £2043 last
year) are enough to pay a 9 p.c. div.

This little concern was established primarily to
arrange credit for would-be customers of the Civil
service stores in Melbourne, and it is worked in
conjunction with that distressful business. The capi-
tal is a modest £2292, which, along with £312 of
borrowed money etc., is all represented by advances,
the quality ot the advances isn’t, of course ascer-
tainable merely by looking at their total on a sheet
ot paper._ The directors say they could do a lot
more business if they had the money to do it with •
but as the idea is to assist the temporarily hard-up
public servant rather than make a big profit out of
him, the ordinary, money-grubbing investor doesn’t
rush the shares.

The year’s results would have shown up much
better but for the writing off of £SOO from pro-
perty and fittings account. The paid capital nowadays
is £12,911 (it used to be more until a nasty acci-
dent happened to the cash while the co.’s confidential
officer was looking) ; and, as the advances (including
stock) amount to £32,254, approximately £16,000
has to be raised on deposit to finance the business.
The assets consist almost wholly of pledges and
stock —£32,254 out of a total of £39,666. Obvi-
ously almost everything therefore depends upon the
stock-taking. A cheerful Isaac by putting a liberal
value on the family cruet, etc., might bring the co.
out with a bigger profit and therefore a bigger re-
serve fund than it shows; while a Jeremiah, with
an eye for nothing much but the rust and the moth,
might cut down the value of the pledges so low as
to make the profit entirely disappear. And whether
it is cheerful Isaac or doleful Jeremiah who does
the valuing mere accounts can’t of course disclose

stantial, taking the co.’s obligations and risks into
account, but they have been steadily cut into, and
the dividend should come down. It might do the

That table starts from the time when the Federal’s
face was washed, and it was sent out from the
Inebriates’ Retreat, apparently a cured and converted
institution. It had got into dreadful habits in the old
days, but after 11 years of painful treatment, it was
judged fit to go into ordinary business again. Nomin-
ally, therefore, the old concern was wound up and
the undertaking sold to the present new one. The
remaining assets were valued at £122,839, so when
anew co. was formed, with a capital of £96,351,
there remained £26,488 over, and that amount was
used as the nucleus of a reserve fund. Since the con-
verted co. started, what looks like very satisfactory
progress has been made. Here you are:—

Foreclosed properties, valued at £54,071 in 1904, '
have been steadily got rid of, until now there is
only £8927 worth on the books. At the outset the
co. used to show a profit on sales; lately the accounts
haven’t disclosed either a profit or a loss. That is
curious, and suggests that there is probably an
undisclosed contingency reserve to come and go on.
As properties have been sold new advances have been
made; also a moderate amount has been borrowed
and then lent out to clients. There has been very
fair profit in this business so far ; whether there will
be ultimate profit in it depends, of course, upon
whether the co. gets paid 20s. in the £. It is a
fine thing to see foreclosed properties moving off
briskly, and leaving, in most cases, an actual profit
to the mortgagee.; but there is this to remember:
if property values are so inflated as that,
it is highly probable that new advances are
being made on too high a basis, with the result
that losses Will be shown when the slump comes.
Whether this or any other mortgage co. in particular
is making this mistake cannot, of course, be told
from the accounts ; and that is the risk the investor
has to take.
W. J. Miles has failed in his appeal to
the High Court in the Sydney Meat Preserving case.
The S. M. P. Cos. was formed many years ago by
stockowners to keep up the price of fat stock. The
thing has ever since been done by the simple process
of bidding up when the market showed signs of
slackness. Moreover, most of the owners allow the
co, a rebate of per lb., so that when it bids
(say) £lO, it usually has to pay only about £9
10s. Anybody else who wants that beast must, how-
ever, bid higher than £lO, though the £lO is really
a fictitious bid. Obviously the higher the co. forces
the market, and the less profit it makes, the better
for the stockowning shareholders. Hence the co
has never paid a div. This was all right until Miles
who doesn’t own any fat stock, inherited a very
large number of shares—more, in fact, than anybody
else owns. He naturally wanted a dividend, and
tried to compel the directors to work the thing as
an ordinary business concern and pay one. The High
Court has, however, decided (Justice Isaacs dissent-
ing-) that they needn’t do anything of the sort. Said
Chief Justice Griffith, with whom Justice Barton con-
curred: “The injunction sought in this case is, in
substance, a mandatory injunction to command the
directors and the company to set their affections on
other objects than those which have hitherto at-
tracted them. Although such an injunction would be
an entire novelty, I should not hesitate to grant it
if it were consistent with any known principle of law
But, m my opinion, the law allows the members of
a company to adopt what policy they please to
guide them in carrying on its operations. If they
think fit to carry them on with the collateral object
of enabling another enterprise to be carried on with
greater success than would otherwise be possible I
think that they are entitled to do so without any
interference from the Court, provided they do not
expend the funds of the company upon any object
not authorised by. its constitution.” This must be
accepted as good law; but it none the less leaves
things in a horribly unpleasant state for W. J. Miles
and the least the other shareholders can do is to buv
him out at a. fair valuation. *

Effifcient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and sav
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

a year which was marked by the keenest competition
from beginning to end, is an achievement which
proves that the Colonial Mutual is a force to be

Without anv intention of putting it
through this session, the Commonwealth Government
has introduced the long-pronnsed Insurance BiUj em
the recommendations of the Lommissiu
wWch reported some time ago. The measure deals
with all sorts of insurance concerns and generally
sneaking deals with them very well. I erhaps tne
two molt striking provisions so far as hie offices OT
enneerned refer to deposits and policy reserves.
Existing offices are to put up £20,000 with the Com-
monwealth Treasury, in cash or approved securities
' i must add £IO,OOO a year till £loo,uuu is
reached. Other insurance cos. (including foreigners,
who must have a registered Australian representa-
tive! must put up £20,000. In the case of anew
insurance co. (any sort) formed in the Com,non-
wealth the first deposit is to be £2OOO. that win
stop any more purely mutual offices —unless, as in the
case of the National Mutual, some people put up
a: 2000 for the mere sake of getting anew concern
going. After the first deposit has been made, _o p.e.
of the premium income—or £IO,OOO, whichever is
tb f , smaller—must be added to the £2OOO every year.
As to policy reserves, if a premium remains un-
naid for 30 davs —the usual period of grace the
companv may charge compound interest upon it.
The policy is not to lapse until the premiums due
and unpaid, together with the interest charged, are
enual to the reserve value. During the second year
after the cessation of payments, the company may
~j ve notice in writing to convert the reserve value
into a paid-up policy. “Reserve value and sur-
render value” are, of course, very different cattle,
the former is a matter of actuarial science ; the
latter is anything that the office likes to make it.
It is not provided that anybody may demand cash
for a policy which he may want to throw up. Any
such transaction, it seems, must still be a matter tor
negotiation between the co. and the policyholder
with the trump cards held by the co.
There is to be an insurance commissioner, who is
to have extensive powers of inquiry, and is to make
an annual report on the working of the Act. He is
to see that cos. prepare their accounts and their pro-
posals” in a prescribed form. Government audit is
not, however, provided for. And finally, the fact
that you have been hanged is not to prevent your
widow getting your insurance money. #
Another reason why Australian life offices
should be content with the good business they can
do in Australia arrives from S’Africa. When tne
sorely-harassed Colonial Mutual decided that it
wasn’t going fast enough in the Commonwealth, it
moved on to S’Africa, and set up local Boards and
agencies there. A while ago the head-office rubbed
its eyes and read this: —
“No doubt by this time you have heard about ine
from your Cape office ; if not, permit me to give you
a few particulars. (1) I have taken several hundred
pounds in premiums. (2) I have drawn a loan on
policy ‘A. Marsh’ in vour favor. (3) I have drawn
a claim—M. C. Friedman —for £IOOO in my own
favor (this policy matures about five years hence).
(4) I have written a letter to your London office, and
had same signed by your secretary at Capetown, ask-
ing them to pay me the sum of £3157 10s., and
tins has been done.”
After setting out these and a few other things, the
self-confessed culprit asked that no proceedings
should be taken, on the ground that he had practi-
cally unlimited power at the Capetown office on a
salary of £ 216 a year. Says he: —
“I recorded all the correspondence in the morning,
and passed such letters as I wished over to the other
clerks. I took premiums at the counter, and did the
pay-in daily. I had charge of the petty cash. I
drew cheques when I wished, and had them signed
without question. I, had full charge of the whole
renewal department. I checked all notices and re-
ceipts goinc out of the office. I did all surrender
value, loan, - paid-up policy, and many other calcula-
tions required in the office. I had charge of all
claims for payment, and, if my initials appeared on
a claim envelope, no questions were asked. I did all
the abeyance loan advances from the abeyance lists,
and no one else ever touched them. I did all the
correspondence for renewal department.”
Assuming that the man’s confession, is true, it shows
what sort of supervision an Australian office is liable
to exercise over a small business scattered through
S’Afriea and other remote places. #
B. H. Junction North is busy on its new
slime-treating campaign, having laid in a big stock
of that tough material. During a recent week 1180
tons of the stuff were put through, out of a total of
3569 tons of all sorts (ore, etc.) fed to the plant.
The return was 594 tons of lead concentrates, value
56 p.c. lead and 330 z. silver, and 410 tons zinc con-
centrates, value 42 p.c. zinc and 15oz. silver. The
recoveries show an improvement. But recoveries
don’t tell the whole tale; you need to know some-
thing about costs —including depreciation. The
latter is most important. Junction North, moreover,
paid a very high price for some of its purchased
slimes; but, fortunately, the lead market continues
very firm.

The Commonwealth Oil Corporation
loaded a few tons of oil-fuel into the Commonwealth
destroyers at Sydney the other day, in fulfilment of
a contract. But the corporation is an exceedingly
sick giant these days, and operations are being car-
ried on only on a very small scale at Hartley Yale.
The works at Wolgan have been shut down for
months, and nothing is being done to develop the
very big deposits of rich shale known to exist between
the Capertee and Wolgan valleys. The co. is still in
existence, of course, but everything is in the hands of
the receivers, who are carrying on the business, and
can hardly be making a profit. The co.’s money has
all gone, and there is still a lot of development, etc.,
to do. What will be the end of it all nobody knows,
though it is certain somebody is going to make a
lot of money out of those shale deposits some day.
Westralia’s gold yield goes on shrinking.
For the 11 months ended November it totalled
1,166,7140 z. ; the year’s shortage, compared with
the 1911 figures will be about 100,0000 z., and (say)
200,0000 z. less than the output for 1910. The Gov-
ernment has just introduced a Bill to abolish piece-
work and the night shift, and to reduce the under-
ground weekly working hours to 44. These things,
whatever else they do, won’t assist in instantly check-
ing the drop in production.
Mines Minister Collier (W.A.) has agreed
to assist copper seekers in the distant Roeboume
field, by advancing cash against ore bagged ready
for shipment. The stone will be assayed by a Gov-
ernment man, and after deducting cost of sampling,
transport, realisation, etc., an advance up to two-
thirds of the estimated net value will be made. The
scheme will enable prospectors in remote parts to get
the, often-indispensable quick returns from their
labor. # * *

F A. Govett, on Lake View and Star, at
the Lake View and Oroya Exploration meeting:
“Earnings now amount to £40,000, or about-Opc.
n a and are likely to continue so. For some
years we have not had to make any reductionsi in
the grade. Development continues to reveal fresh
bodies of ore, and after an interval of about _ seven
years we have resumed sinking. The Star mine is
opening up well, and reserves do not include any-
thing below the fifth level, while we know of good
reserves as deep as 1100 ft. The co. is at present
distributing £30,000, or 15 p.c. p.a., but as soon
as some modest reserve is reached we shall not Want
to pile up funds, and the full earnings of £40,000
or 20 p.c. will be available for dividends. 1
think an increase to 18 p.c. will almost certainly be
made in December. You cannot well value this
share at less than 35., seeing that at 18 p.c. the
dividend value works out at four years purchase.
Our holding of 626,999 shares would at 3s. per
share be worth £94,000, while our share of the
profits with a dividend of 18 p.c. would be
£22,500.” # *
Sand Queen (W.A.) is doing so well that
a Christmas box, in the shape of additional treatment
plant, to cost £IOOO, is to be given to it. This will,
it is stated, enable the dividends to be increased to
Is. a month.
* * * *
The derelict Greenmount, Southern Cross
(W.A.), has got a further respite from labor con-
ditions. It has been worked off and on since 1905,
and although 67,000 tons have been extracted and
crushed for an average yield of 18s. 2d., the co. is
without funds and scrip is unsaleable. Present exemp-
t.ion was obtained to realise on assets and try to let
the mine on tribute.

Obit: Birthday Gift Cos. # #
“Bar None”: Re Great Boulder, “Bar
One” (B. 28/11/’l2) said the mine had good healthy
values to shove it along the road to dividends, cham-
pagne and press notices. It had, and it also had a
management that worked honestly, and not for mar-
ket purposes like some of the mines he blows about.
As regards costs, about which “Bar One” seems to
know little or nothing: in these days of fake and
fraud, monthly accounts can be, and are, doctored so
frequently by giving some costs and suppressing-
others, that no one (except “Bar One” and perhaps
a few other credulous persons like him) dreams of
taking them seriously. F’rinstance, a co. may treat
(sav) 3000 tons a month for £SOOO, and spend
£3OOO or £1 per ton to get it. But in order to
hoodwink shareholders and impress the guileless
“Bar One” and his cobbers, the tonnage is given
as 3500, costs are stated as a shade over 175., and
the profitable working of “low-grade ore” is dis-
honestly whooped about. This sort of thing has been
done over and over again at Kalgoorlie, and people
who ought to know say it is being done still. Even
where costs are not faked, a comparison _is
difficult in the case of a field like the Golden Mile,
where the size and character of the ore bodies, etc.,
differ so much. “Bar One” makes another “bloomer,”
when he says that Boulder’s three main hauling
shafts save trucking. Two of them certainly lend
a helping hand in that direction, but the third (Ham-
ilton’s) is nearly a quarter of a mile away from the
mill, and all the ore from that section has to be
trucked every foot of the way. His contention that
the management is dawdling in the work of deep
prospecting is his, and no one else’s, and the fact
that in June last four directors were on the register
for barely 13,000 shares, proves and means nothing.
In the case of some of the big Westralian mining
cos., directors are on the register for many thousands
of shares, and are “short” of them all and many
thousands besides at prices much higher than the
present market quotes.
“The treatment of the Transvaal (W.A.)
ore presents no insuperable difficulty,” says director
T. J. Hoover in his report on the different properties
in which the Lake View and Oroya Exploration is
interested. If so, why has the mine, with its 48,509
tons of 445. reserves ready for stopfng, been so ener-
getically hawked for sale during the last two years?
The fact is, no one is anxious to take on the job of
treating the Transvaal ore after the costly fail-
ures at the very similar Lancefield.
William Rain, chairman of North Nug-
getty, Daylesford, recently wrote divs. in sight down
to the 15s. mark. The Queen-street plungers consoled
themselves by saying the expert wasn’t born who
could estimate a Victorian mine ; so when a develop-
ment came in the mine and in the Central next door,
the Rain stock went down as prices went up. Still
William turned up at the half-yearly meeting with
his usual pleasant smile, and in a nice way declined!
to write values up above the “visible” point and a
reasonable “probable” expectation. Another sweet
William, in Bill Gullock, the manager, supplied the
sweetening to this sauce, otherwise one or two of the
disappointed crowd would have tumbled off their
seats from heat apoplexy. Gullock’s idea is to tear
out nine months’ divs., and he thinks he can develop
another nine months’ dirt in the meantime. A
statement like that gives the lie to those who said
that Gullock was a plant about to adorn the Nug-
getty scrap heap. Still, putting nine and nine to-
gether doesn’t make 305., any more than it tots up
to the famous 90s. mark, where Queen-street got left
when the crash came.
* * * *
New Jubilee, Scarsdale (Vic.), lives up to
its income. Last half-year it trundled 128,888 tons
to the battery. This stuff graded 4|dwt. per ton,
and left the co. with only about £IOSO after a thou-
sand had been spent on plant. Yet the Board de-
clared a 6d. div., leaving only £SOO to start the
new year with. Looking at its past, the mine hasn’t
done badly, 91,743 tons having given £110,567
worth of gold, from which £24,750 has been spun
out as divs. But most of the profits have come from
the upper levels; so if the junction of the main lode
and the western formation at 1000 ft. doesn’t bring
a rich patch, another Scarsdale hero will have proven
that he hasn’t the vitality to exist below the 1000 ft.
zone. This poverty at depth is the odd and un-
pleasant feature of the district. As usual, the costs
sheet of the New Jubilee looks nice—mining and
filling 6s. lid. per ton, hauling Is. 4d. per ton, de-
velopment Is. lid., crushing is. Old. ; total 11s. 3d.

South New Moon, Bendigo, on a called-
up capital of 17s. 7d. (32,000 shares), has shelled
out £ls 6s. 6d. per share, and has still a great deal
more than a bob left. Costs with it now reach 225.
2d. per ton ; but much of that arises- from heavy de-
velopment work, partly in the old mine and partly in
sinking on the Paddy’s Gully line. Surveyor W. H.
Cundy, who does the mothering- for a lot of Bendigo
shows, wants South Moon to rattle up the old bones by
trying to pick up the extension of the spurs worked by
the New Moon, next door, at 416 ft., and by opening
up the big body of spurry country at 820 ft. To-day
the co. relies mostly on the big block of spurry
ground above 980 ft., as the stone opened up at
1140 ft. isn’t too extensive, though some of it has
crushed fairly well. The co. may shine yet by mak-
ing a good hit on the Paddy’s Gully line. The belt
of country in which the Moon group lives has been
so remunerative that the very name of the co. would
bring in buyers if once a good report was forth-
coming. #
The giant at Ararat (Vic.) is still Catli-
cart Central, which, without drawing on the acknow-
ledged rich belt of wash opened up, can give rattling
good dirt from the development drives now being
pushed out; 16380 z. from 380 fathoms, the record
for the past six months, is better than any alluvial
show has done since Cathcart alighted on its rich
patch in the early Bryant days. Work off No. 4 rise
to the south-west didn’t prove too cheery, and there
seems to be some difference of opinion as to whether
driving was not done too far in this direction.
Anyway, to the nor’-west 60ft. of good wash was got,
though values shaded off. Water is heavy, but there
needn’t be much loss of sleep wondering whether the
pumps can beat it, as the pressure is being steadily re-
duced. Still, there is a deal of nasty talk about the
water and the lower-grade material developed lately,
just as if such things were unusual. Alluvial shows
have had both troubles, and yet have stood far higher
on the share list than Central Cathcarts have ever
done.

Charters Towers for 11 months of this
year belted out £351,677, or £172,054 less than
in the corresponding period of 1911. November gave
only £29,140, as compared with £48,658 12 months
ago. For 11 months the dividends were only
£31,824, while the calls were £35,200; but the
figures will be improved before the end of the month,
and the outlook is than * the figures
The last crushing of the Papuan Brilliant
and Victoria, Charters Towers, was worth £2977
from 284 tons of stone—the best yield since the
Moonstone reef was re-opened. Still, the market is
languid, for the reef at the bottom of the underlay
shaft is low-grade. And with poverty in the bottom,
the reserves and “probable” reserves of good stone are
limited. The co. is in 96,000 shares. The new
Queen Cross, next door, has 200,000.
Hampden Cloncurry (Q.) got hold of a
prize when it bought the Duchess, for the mine has
good values at the deepest level yet touched —48ft.
below the 550 ft. The bottom of the winze shows
57in. of ore, assaying 23 p.c. This winze is riffbt in
the heart of the richest zone in the mine, some 220 ft.
north of the shaft. Helped by this patch, the
Duchess has been supplying the smelters with ore
averaging 18 p.c. In connection with the returns
from the works, it should be noted that those for
September (721 tons), October (725 tons), and
November (650 tons) included the product from
accumulated copper matte, 2125 tons of which were
treated in three months, representing, roughly, 700
tons copper. This, of course, should be credited to
the period when the ore was reduced to matte. As
a regular thing, the directors expect an output of
from 600 to 650 tons of copper per month, but the
scarcity of fuel or fluxes may cause variations.
* * * *
Waihi, Maoriland’s once-big mine, may-
have a kick in it yet as .a low-grade proposition.
The directors, thinking so, continue to push on with
the electric power scheme, and are not over-anxious
at present to purchase another property, although
various proposals are under consideration. The co.
is well off for cash.

The amalgamation of the Tasmanian
Smelting Cos. with the Hercules and Primrose mining
cos. is under consideration, and a report by G. H.
Blakemore on the project will soon be available. The
conditions favor consolidation —of some interests,
anyway—for a good deal of capital will be required
if the zinc problem is to be tackled in earnest.
Hitherto Australia has had no mines worked ex-
clusively, or almost exclusively, for zinc.
Tongkah Harbor’s return of 37 tons of
tin oxide for a week’s work is more cheerful than
late reports have been. The dredge-building still
continues; the next machine will be able to dredge
the tin-wash from a depth of 60ft. The plan of the
harbor shows a narrow streak of worked ground,
evidently following the course of an old river bed.
The decline in the yield from a whole fleet of dredges
suggests that values have gradually tailed off, as
dredging has been pushed further out. Concentrates,
dressed to 70 p.c. metallic tin, have been recently
selling at £l3O at Tongkah. On 76 tons produced
in November, the return would be £9BB0 —hardly
enough to pay all expenses and leave a net profit of
£SOOO, which is required if the quarterly £15,000
is to be forthcoming.

“R. Sayers”; Re the contribution of “An
Old Insurance Man” (B. 19/12/’l2). The recom-
mendations made by the Commission on Insurance do
not embrace the payment of a cash surrender value at
all. In fact, the commissioners specifically advise
against it, and state their reasons for so doing (see
pages 21 and 22 of the Report). Where, therefore,
does the question of “harpies” arise, and where
the value or necessity of the suggested short bill?
What the commissioners do recommend is that in the
event of the payments under a policy being discon-
tinued, the actuarial reserve should be anplied pro
tanto to maintain the policy in force ; but, as above
stated, thev go so far as to recommend that there
be no guaranteed cash surrender value at all. Evi-
dently “An Old Insurance Man” does not know so
much of his subject as he thinks he does. #
“Vagabond”: Here’s another lot of Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders who have wandered from
their homes to take a lead in tearing the golden in-
nards from the earth. The bunch I’ve just been with
is in Paracale, in the top of the Philippines. The
compa-ny is dredging 1 the stuff out of the little rivei
there, and from one or two other small streams
round the corner. Only about a score of white men
are on the job, all told, and most of them are from
the best country. Some of the exiles have been
marooned there for about five years and others are
new-chums of a bare year. Paracale itself is a one-
horse sort of show —though, by the way, the local
ox-waggon and hansom is “horsed” with a carabo,
which is a splay-footed, sleep-walking, hump-backed
caricature of a cross between a bullock, a gnu, _ a
tired snail and a cake of mud with whiskers on its
nose. The other animals in sight are gaunt pigs, a
derelict goat or two, the weirdest breed of mongrel
native dog, a few chickens, and plenty mosquitoes.
The mosquitoes are about the same size as the chick-
ens. The whites live chiefly on quinine, tinned meats,
hens, and hopes of seeing home some day. The
female population (white) numbers two (2). One
hundred p.c. is married ; 50 p.c. is American and 50
p.c. Maoriland. The principal edifices are one old
Spanish church. Its bell has the sound of a soul in
torment, and it rings on an average 10 times a day
oftener than anyone wants it to. The chief industries
are (native) building dredges and working them, and
(white) tearing hair over the way the nigs, do these
things, or, oftener, don’t do them. The dredges are
the bucket type, and the river has to have its bed
taken up and shaken to a depth of about 40ft. The
metal is mostly line, with occasional patches of
coarse, and evidently it grew right where it is
found, as it has sharp, uncut edges without a sign
of being waterworn. Lumps of quartz are also
scooped up, and these are crushed on the spot. Alto-
gether there are four dredges at work, and another
two are being rigged as quick as the machinery can
be fetched along. Paracale is a small place, but it
holds enough all-white hospitality to the stranger
within its sliprails for a township 20 times Jts size.
“Hail Columbia” Hoover has something
interesting to say on “Mine Valuation and Mine
Finance.” in the October London Mining Magazine.
As a means of overcoming some of the difficulties
inherent in the valuation of so tricky an asset as
a mine, Hoover suggests the issue of debentures in
lieu of shares to cover the assured profit in a mine,
leaving the prospective value to be expressed in
shares. Any statement of profit assured ought, ac-
cording to Hoover, to give (1) the tonnage of
ore, (2) the maximum distance in feet that the
ore has been assumed to continue beyond a sampled
face, (3) the average value, (4) the percentage
of extraction assumed, (5) the working cost, (6) if
other than a gold mine the price of metals assumed,
(7) the cost of new equipment necessary to recover
the profit, (8) the loss of interest involved during
♦he period necessary to recover this profit. Profit
assured, subject to these conditions, is, he claims,
security worthy of a debenture or a bond redeemable
out of this profit.


Peter F. Heering reports that the
last year has been an advance on the pre-
vious one, and his well-known Cherry
Brandy liqueur, with the Blue and Choco-
late Label, is well in evidence throughout
all Australasia; this being only a small
portion of his all-over-the-world output. He
with his two sons have the command of this
liqueur trade, their brand being well in
advance of all competitors, and, for an after-
dinner liqueur, no one who has dined well,
feels that their repast is well finished if a

is not the final bonne louche.*

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 23, 1912.
My Dear Arini. —
The State is rejoicing in a much better
season than was expected a few months
back. So, in spite of the vast amount of
capital which is being driven away, the city
shops are bulging with country visitors, and
the sheep-farmer can still say baa to the
Christmas goose. Indeed, N.S.W is
apparently bursting its sides with laugh-
ter and joy, though still the Raven
croaks ‘Bad times.” The Government
might appoint a Commission of de-
tectives, armed with search warrants, to
look for the address of that Lost Capital.
The departure of the Islingtons from Maori-
land s Government House lifts a load from
local Society, which has felt ever since the
haughty lady Excellency arrived that it has
been living on sufferance. Islington him-
self was well liked, but his bitter half ill-
concealed her disappointment at being
dragged or coaxed from Civilisation to Pov-
erty Bay and thereabouts. It is credited to
her that she said of the two leading cities:
In Wellington everybody is in Societv • in
Auckland nobody is in Society.” So she
goes back to London where only the intel-
lectual and .the brewers are in Society.
Governor and Lady Chelmsford enter-
tained members of the Teachers’ Confer-
ence at a garden party the other afternoon.
A broiling morning tamed down into a cool
and dusty day, watered by a few dozen rain-
drops.
Before you run out of Christmas good
wishes, wireless a few to the nurses in the
public institutions. I don’t mean the regu-
lar hospitals, but such places as the Rook-
wood Asylum, the Waterfall Sanatorium
and the infirmaries.” Life is not choco-
lates and motor-cars for the attendants at
these places. The Rookwood nurses had-
their salary put up, I’m told, to £llO a
year. But when they got that rise, the
Government also increased the deduction
made for maintenance. It used to be £25 a
year;_ now it is £4O. You’ll say that £4O a
year isn t much to charge for the board and
at gm ? of a heart .Y young woman, and that
Mrs. Apartments Vacant wouldn’t do it for
a “ one y- Quite true; but, then, Mrs
Ap. Vacant hasn’t the right to call on her
young women to lend a hand whenever they
chance to be on the premises.
Besid s, Mrs. Apartments Vacant expects
to have to supply her young women with
every meal they eat, whereas the Rookwood
" ars , e gets away whenever she can. If she
didn t she would probably remain at Rook-
wood for good, merely shifting to the ceme-
tery next door. The food is very poor stuff
and there isn’t too much of it. There is a
dietary scale ; the nurse is allowed so many
ounces of this and so many gills of that—
I remember it’s three gills of milk, which is
something over half-a-pint. Such a thing
as cake or afternoon-tea is, I’m told, un-
known, unless the nurses pay for it them-
selves. And, remember, these women, who
have the unappetising stuff pushed before
them, have probably just come from the
harrowing work of attending to as
many as 100 patients. Think of even 50
patients, old mostly, helpless many of them
•?? 1 ? d J nearly all of them >' numbers of them
with bedsores ; a few of them with worse than
that. Picture yourself in such surround-
mgs, with the work of attending to such
sufferers, and with the knowledge that you
will very likely have to attend a death-bed
before the week is out. Then reflect on the
deduction of £4O a year for the nurse’s
maintenance, leaving well under 30s. a week
tor the nurse herself, and—well, I’ll let you
say what you like about the parsimony of
the administration.
However, they are not careful merely over
tne nurses’ rations and their pay. Many
of the inmates at Rookwood are dying of
tuberculous lungs and throats. If they are
not far gone they are sent to Waterfall; if
they are doomed they remain at Rookwood—
its handy to Sydney’s Great City of the
Dead. Many pigs are kept at the institu-
tion. 4he fork plays to and fro between the
consumptive’s mouth and. the plate; and the
leavings on the plate go—where? Two or
three weeks ago the cows at the institution
were found to be. tuberculous. I wish some-
body would examine the pigs—not grown, let
me add to reassure you, for outside consump-
tion.
The Mitchell Library lost one of its trus-
tees John Hughes, M.L.C., by death, last
Almost at the same moment Professor
MacCallum was leaving the president’s
AT- ail i V? the board-room of the Public and
Mitchell libraries. Mr. Arthur Dowling,
who hates to be contradicted when he trots
out . historical . details re the early pure-
merino in this paddock, will take the
MacCallum s place.
A. hankering to attend public or semi-
public funerals is becoming a vice with a
section of lady-voters in these parts. A man
who had to almost fight his way to the open
grave of George Rignold, tells me it was
an amazing spectacle to see women with in-
fants in their arms scrambling to get the
best places, with the cheerful chatter that
attends the daily gossip over the back fence,
lhe heat and dust, the tawdry remarks of
parson -North Ash (who told the assembly
hacl buried both Mr. Rignold’s wives, on
different dates, of course), and the fierce de-
sire of women and .young children to get
near the coffin, contributed to the gloom of
the occasion The open grave is not gen-
erally considered a fitting spot for a long
dissertation on Shakspeare, mixed with a
-ick of religion, and a dash of the musical
glasses and an allusion to Socrates and
Greek sculpture. Our mutual friend Blicks
saj s it does him harm to go to big spectacu-
lai funerals he swears all the way home.
, Kindergarten Training College (Ros-
lyn Gardens) took a hand in the general
breaking-up riot, and you could hardly see
the pupils heads above the deluge of Good
Advice. Miss Harriet A. Dumolo, the
brisk young principal, read her report in firm
tones. Incidentally, she snared a compli-
ment from Mr. Public Instruction Board,
who is not given to hurling bouquets at lady
pedagogues. “Ability, enthusiasm and com-
monsense” were the triplet of posies the
usually very tough Mr. Board handed Miss
Dumolo after her official statement. No
lady present fainted away at this unex-
pected outbreak of appreciative language,
but the teaching profession may have fanned
itself violently and sniffed sal volatile to
keep its mental balance.
This graduation of kindergarten students
occurred in St. James’s Hall, and was
trimmed with the remarks of Mr. Arthur
Giles, of Sydney Grammar School. Gaily
wandering from the school primer to the hat
feminine, he assured his audience that dur-
u e l as t,lo years the women of Sydney
had been chiefly conspicuous for the number
u -, n J ew “ iU i n ers’ shops they had helped to
build. The learned Louisa Macdonald, of the
V\ omen s College, who is supposed to be in-
different to the frivolity of feathers, might
have attacked the cynic Giles in Greek
verse, but she mercifully abstained. Mrs.
Clara Evans, a fairly new arrival, decor-
ated the interludes with attractive song.
Hr. Andrew Davidson pleaded once more for
the training of the mentally-deficient child
by specially qualified teachers. Prof. Alex
Maclae, of the Teachers’ Training College
was present with his youthful fiancee, Miss
Duncan, who is also in the dominie busi-
ness. Gen. sec. Ellen Desailly lent her aid
as recording angel.
Indulgent parents, fond aunts and other
hard-working relatives are toiling to keep
up with the annual rush of children’s parties.
Mrs. T. Holdsworth’s infant revel, the other
afternoon, raged round a Christmas tree that
nearly foundered through its tub being over-
loaded beyond, the Plimsoll line. Seventy
young things, in curls and miscroscopic mus-
lin skirts, relieved the situation by getting
away with a present apiece. Santa Claus
was master of ceremonies.
The Twilight House League had another
meeting last week in the Town Hall. The
committee has resolved to stick to the
original name, “Twilight House,” which is
a great deal more expressive than some of
the banal substitutes suggested by Suburbia,
which is accustomed to reside in miscalled
villas, with pepper-pot towers, in streets that
perpetuate the worst crimes in nomenclature.
During the coming holidays, committee
dames, will ransack town and country for
subscriptions, chairs, tables, broom handles,
ideas, and anything else they can pick up.
ihe results will be aired at a public meeting
in January.
Miss Jenkins, the Murkan lady who used
to train kindergarten students "at Roslyn
Gardens College, has swallowed a hurried
snack of the Montessori method, in Italy,
since her departure from this city. Now
another disciple. Miss Simpson, of the Pub-
lic Instruction Department, will set forth on
the same quest. The Montessori method ap-
pears to be another artful scheme for de-
luding the young child into an unnatural
love of acquired knowledge. The pill of
learning is wrapped up in the jam of play.
Miss Simpson, already an authority on in-
fant education, will bottle up the results of
her pilgrimage for home consumption.
“Milestones,” at the Criterion, sees Julius
Knight make love in Act I.—a knightly
specialty, which, goads even the front stalls
to softly pat their gloved palms. He does it
on one knee in the baggy garments of 1860.
In the next act (1885 period) Julius is less
decorative. He grows mutton-chop whiskers
and scowls upon romance from the height
ot an impending baronetcy. Then he be-
stows his weeping daughter’s affections on a
mere iord. In the third act, as grandpa
Rliead, Julius is so unlike the Superbus of
yore that he finishes up the scene in an
arm-chair. This sacrifice will yet cause a
revolution in the gallery.
Were all the dressing-rooms of 1860 so
lull ot white antimacassars and green up-
holstery as the Rheads’ room in “Milestones” ?
Were the forget-me-nots of that era as hard
and spiky-looking as the cold-blue wreath
which sits like a domestic halo on the flaxen
wig of Rose Sibley? Julius Knight-Rhead
only avoids getting a mouthful of the spikes
by carefully saluting the meek brow beneath
the halo Grace Noble, the charming
Gertrude Rhead of 1860, gets more fun out
or flounces than the rest of the party As
this is all the joy the authors five her, she
has a fairly dismal time in 1885. And in
l')12 she is still waiting—with some im-
patience, one imagines—for the undertaker.
Mrs. Ka.te Helen Weston, secretary of the
Elder Conservatorium (Adelaide), strolled
into Sydney one morning last week. In the
spare moments of a generous Christmas
holiday, Kate Helen, a small, alert woman,
with a capable manner, will industriously
tread the Inky Way. She’s on the trail of
copy in the Northern Territory, which
she 11 meet in the wet season a week or two
hence. Mrs. Weston takes a daughter with
her as far as Queensland.
A slim booklet comes this way. It bears
the unhandy title, “The Crossing of the
Blue Mountains Centenary,” and makes a
remark you have probably heard before—
‘Money very urgently required.” In May
the committee, which has Mr. Frank Walker
as president, will try to serve out a generous
helping of brass bands, bunting, demon-
strating school children, and official ban-
quets garnished with speeches. The first
successful efforts, in 1818, to penetrate the
then unknown land beyond the indigo-blue
hills that shoulder the skyline 3000-odd feet
above the Nepean River, were of priceless
value to Australian pioneers. The explorers,
Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson, are
memorialised in the names of Blue Moun-
tain townships.
The centenary committee intends to spend
half the funds subscribed by the public on “a
lasting memento” of the three explorers
The obelisk on the bald patch of Mount
York already does something in stone to keep
the first dash across the hills before the
tourists eye. The centenary enihusiasts
propose to make a demonstration on this
breezy summit in May. The Mayor of Svd-
ney; Mr. H. G. Remits, Mount Victoria; and
hon. sec. Venning Thomas will receive cash
to help the affair.
Mrs. Percy Hunter and her two boys
leave London in the Seharnhorst on December
23 for this port. Mr. Percy, who has been
turning the feet of the immigrant this way,
has concluded his mission,” and comes home
too.
Miss Dolly O’Donnell, who was married
the other week to Mr. F. B. Shaw, is a
younger daughter of the late and wealthy
P. J. O’Donnell, of our squattocracy. The
bride met the man of her heart during a trip
to the other side. He’s something in Siam,
and the newly-wed have bustled off to that
coffee-colored strand for two years. Later
they’re going to live in England. The girl’s
trousseau built up another record in the mat-
ter of those superfluous luxuries, mostly in
cobweb lace and cr6pe-de-chine, which the
modern gilt-edged bride packs away in a ton
or two of luggage.
Mrs. C. B. Fairfax, who used to be the
pretty Miss Fraser of this township, is com-
ing back to see her native land,'after a
long residence on the other side. Dress is
said to be her favorite recreation.
Actor Ford, who winds up as a 1912
Labor member in “Milestones,” has a ten-
dency to scribble in his spare moments.
When he snatches time for ink, he contrib-
utes to the Harmsworth (London) combina-
tion.
G. L. Goodman, who has kept an eye on
the business end of the J.C.W. firm at Her
Majesty’s for many years, has been seri-
ously ill, but is celebrating the festive sea-
son by leaping along the road to recovery.
Mrs. C. R. Blaxland, who died in Armi-
dale on December 17, was a daughter of the
late Charles Marsh, of Salisbury Court, near
Armidale. Her husband belongs to the nu-
merous clan which proudly traces its descent
from Grandpa Gregory Blaxland, who led
the 1813 expedition over the Blue Moun-
tains.
Glen Innes district broke out in wedding
favors a week or two ago, for the orange-
blossoming of the handsome Hope Lamb.
She is a daughter of Mr. Harry Lamb, who
has a cosy sheep-run in those woolly parts.
The groom is Robert Connell.
The. Rose Bay Golf House has been re-
sounding with a louder tinkle of tea-cups
than usual. First, Miss Patience Raymond’s
friends gave her the farewell bun prior to her
departure from the circle of gay young spin-
sters. A bag and bangle were added to the
good wishes for the day that should change
Miss Raymond into Mrs. Giblin. Then the
bride-elect and her mamma returned the bun,
also at the “Goff” House. Now she’s Mrs.
Giblin, and will probably live mostly in
Perth. He is an engineer or something of
the kind at Coolgardie.
Artist Frances Hodgkins blew in here the
other morning on her way to Maoriland.
Bhe is a small, bright-eyed woman, with a
vivacious _ air, which hasn’t suffered from
residence in Paris. Europe claims her again
later on.
H.M.B. Drake, with the Admirable King-
Hall aboard, has sauntered into our water-
front, after shaking its fin off the Maoriland
coast. The Drake is officially booked to
start for the Channel fog on January 1.
The N.S.W. Gould Bird League had its
second _ annual chirrup the other morning.
The Girls’ High School, where young maid-
ens have recently broken up under vice-regal
patronage, served as the aviary. About
1900 bird-lovers in this State have taken
the pledge to abstain from bird’s-nesting
and similar crimes.
Apart from the Christmas greeting, the
overworked letter-carrier has many solid
reasons for cursing this time of 'turkey.

On Friday Fanny Powers, who is
to , mari 'y Mr. S. Foote of
Adelaide, had a farewell matinee ’from
m, e vaudeville profession, at the Tivoli,
rue miant who sang precocious songs 12 or
14 years ago. turned up her back hair and
let down her skirts only a few years since.
, bright and unspoilt youngster, she has
been a startling exception to the usually
aggressive stage juvenile who squawks be-
hind the footlights like a noisy little peacock.
The brilliant scholar, Dr. Findlay, who
came over to Sydney the other day to meet
his home-coining wife, and take her back to
Maoriland, has a highly-developed artistic
nnnd. One of his beliefs is that people’s
pleasures have more influence in fixing their
moral level than their business pursuits
have. The theatre is to-day, as it always
has been, he says, a reflex of the moral tone
and tendency of its age. To ensure a satis-
factory theatre, he suggested, when Attorney-
General in the Ward Administration, (1)
a social discipline mainly enforced by law
t- u a • stricter regulation of the stage’,
which, in addition to sumiressing the pal-
pably evil, would foster and cultivate the
better class of play, (3) national or muni-
cipal theatres, producing the great tragedies
and dramas _ and cleverest comedies. Find-
lay once boiled his theories into this sen-
tence . . Art in one or other of its many
shapes is the most profitable friend of a
nation’s leisure ; hence the diffusion of true
art is no unworthy aim of government.”
In some respects Maoriland’s Government
was weakened by the loss of Findlay. He
would have made a good Minister for Uni-
versal Culture. And Maoriland could do
with one.
We live in an age that isn’t much afraid
of spooks. Back in a N.S.W. country town
a man, the other day. hanged himself in his
own hall. In the old days his house would
have been shunned, and perhaps in the end
razed to the ground. In these days the house
was promptly taken by a man who knew all
about the tragedy. But, stranger still, the
housekeeper of the self-murdered man, after
going some hundreds of miles away, saw an
advertisement asking for applicants for a
similar job. in her own town, answered it,
and found it was to take the same position
in the same house with the new tenant. She
was offered the billet, at once accented it,
and is now at work within sight of the hang-
ing ghost. Who talks of decadent woman ?
It often happens that when an Aus-
tralian Conservative returns to his native
land, and is interviewed, like Queensland’s
ex-Premier Philp, he almost persuades us
that, owing to Laoor legislation we are on
the rim of a Great Bankruptcy. Then, as
a . curious coincidence, the same press men-
tions that probate has been granted to a few
fat wills. Ewen Cameron, a Wagga pastor-
alist, managed to leave £67,000-odd in spite of
rabbits and land taxes. George Bardwell,
another old identity in the Wagga district,
passed out at the age of 90, about three
months ago. His will has been proved at
£105,441. “The land” still seems to be a
tairly reliable means of keeping the wolf a
few hundred miles from the door.
The W. F. Brennans contemplate a flight
a few thousand feet nearer Pleaven. The
Mountains will be their camping ground
ew Year has climbed the horizon
of 1913.
Mrs. Steer Bowker and a daughter or two
will part the summer down the middle. One
half will be spent in Bowral and the rest
with the Jim Gordons up in the Braidwood
district.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
N. qr M.”: I don’t think there is a
weirder, epitaph, tombstone or such-like in
Australia than a carved tree-trunk near
Frogmore (N.S.W.). The affair has been
roughly hewn to the shape of an unstable
obelisk, and purports to mark the tomb of
John Baker,, though, as a matter of fact,
John takes his rest elsewhere. The old man
spent the leisure hours of years over the
carvings, and achieved a turbaned head, a
horse, a large-featured individual in a top-
(locally supposed to represent the Duke
of Wellington),, and a clock-face with the
hour-hand pointing at 11. Goodness knows
what it all means. But the carver left the
district before he made his last move, so the
highly-decorated monument marks a whim
instead of a grave.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 23, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie,—
G.-G. Denman has departed to Adelaide to
stay with the State cocked hat, and the
Falters have made a bolt for the cool Mace-
don cottage. Melbourne, for the time being,
is bereft of vice-regalities; but the sun still
persists in rising and setting, and Collins-
street seems as cheerful as ever.
Mrs. Alfred Deakin takes a lively interest
in poor babies. She already has a large col-
lection of free kindergartens and creches on
her charitable list, but is now gladly adding
another, whose address is Bouverie-street.
(Didn’t one of the historic Mel-
bourne pushes” hail from Bouverie-street?
I have some disreputable recollection of the
warlike “Bouveroos”—mighty blue-metallur-
gists in their day.) Bouverie-street lives
largely by charing and washing; and Mrs.
Sugden (of Queen’s), Mrs. Norman Brookes,
Mrs. McCracken and Mayoress Hennessy are
all helping to fix up a comfortable place
where baby can play harmlessly until moth-
er s work is over, and she is ready to take
up the other end of her burden once more.
• last Melbourne flutter of “Night-
birds was flower-pelted and generally hil-
arious. Oscar Asche sat behind an acre or
so of shirtfront and comfortably filled half a
box, some of the other half was occupied
by I My Bray ton, robed beautifully in Ori-
ental silks and decorated with water lilies
Various stars and planets of the JCW'
firmament dotted the front of the house!
Hilda Spong, looking about 2st. lighter, was a
gracious sight in black chiffon. With her
was a party of doctors and their womenfolk.
Galeb 1 orter was penned in a south box A
noticeable were Peter Trafalgar Mit-
chell and his wife. Since her last foreign
trip this ? lady seems to parade a new Paris
creation ’ at every public appearance. Sybil
Arundale was off duty for the co.’s last
night, and Australian Dorothy Brunton
tripped in her small shoes.
The _Kew Canoe Carnival, which paddles
more vigorously every year, has again spread
itself over the tree-fringed Yarra. All the
river-siders came and squatted on the
bracken-clad banks, and opened hampers and
thermos bottles of tea under the gums.
Motor boats had racing events further down
stream and shied at snags that the canoes
easily slide over. Every second or third
river-maiden paddles her own shell, and has
a fair idea where the worst snags are
located. Motor-boat enthusiasts at intervals
make a concerted attack on the more or less
responsible councils, and pray them to ex-
tract tlie stumps; but the problem is always
passed along from one to the other, and each
boating party that uses the stream watches
the surface and tries to remember the valu-
able snag-hints in Pilot Mark Twain’s “Old
Times on the Mississippi.” At this latest
canoeing Knight Best, who belongs to one
of the river suburbs, was there with his dame
and pleasing train of little, fair-haired Bests
h red Kcrouse and Mrs. Fred (Essie Perrin
of old)were at the fo’c’sle head of the
function. Kcrouse paid out prizes, held a
race flag and performed other important
duties. A contingent of rowing men drifted
up from the lower reaches to encourage the
milder water-sport and admire the
girls.
David York Syme, jun., was married this
month to Jessie LaycoCk, who lived with her
parents, the Burdett Laycocks, near the
a stronghold in the Balwyn hills.
All the Melbourne Steamship Co.’s boats in
port were flapping with bunting, and the
co. s offices waved more haberdashery in the
city air. Mrs. York Syme, who is a sister
ot our lie Commissioner, was dressed in
ivory brocade with pale pink chiffon roses
horn mg the drapery of the pannier skirts.
Mr ?\- rdett haycock, in grey, received the
wedding guests at Frognall. There were
heaps of burglar-baiting presents,
and a string_band to play accompaniments to
tne rood. The bride endured the ceremony
prettily in Limerick lace and other things,
and, later on, went off to Sydney in a smart
grey dress. Trinity Church and the Laycock
house were obscured with beautiful vege-
tables, and grandmamma Cornelius looked
magnificent in a rich snreading gown of
duchess satin and Chantilly lace.
The Very Best People are feverishly mak-
mg readv for Thursday, January 9, on which
day Marjorie Jowett and Clive Fairbairn
are to put on the holy shackles of matri-
mony in the ivy-covered Scotchbyterian kirk
at loorak, and, later, listen to toasts at
Manmngham. A section of Fairbairn rela-
tives depart for England immediately after
the confetti has been swept up.
. e t a Brandt, a dainty little Hawthorn
girl, was married to barrister Ted Lewis on
December 15. Dr. Strong did the job.
after which a family party petrolled round
to the Grand Hotel to champagne the occa-
sion. Sister Mrs. Forbes fluttered about
Wl . th P ink roses in her hat. and looked like
a fresh young bridesmaid. Mrs. Brandt was
stately in black and ostrich feathers. Uncle
Crown-Prosecutor Sam Leon was on hand
with his wife and daughter Ethel, the girl
who acts in an excellent amateur way with
the Repertory Theatre folk. Andrew McClel-
land, an American friend of Elwood Mead,
was substitute for _ that absent man at the
party. Mayor Wilks Malvern) and his
Mayoress were present in their store clothes.
All hands pelted the bride with rose leaves
as she sprinted for the motor in a grev suit
with a hat full of chiffon roses. Then the
remaining members of the party sang “For
felie s a Jolly Good Female,” and the bell
boy started to tidv up.
atr i ce Holl °way, of the Get-Rich-Quick
Wallingford co., played lead in a matri-
monial performance, at St. Peter’s, Eastern
Hill, on Friday last. Bob Greig, of the
same co., was the other principal party.
It is rumored that a member of a local
wealthy clan, at present in foreign parts, is
liable to become engaged at any moment to
a daughter of Pierpont Morgan.
Melbourne is “simply dying” to see the
bride of Sam McCulloch. The lady, who
was an American widow before he claimed
her hand, accompanies him home in the New
Year, when the pair and Sam’s two school-
girl daughters will repair to Woodlands, the
station homestead so beloved of Governor
Ilopetoun during his earliest Victorian days.
A heap of nice Victorian mothers yearned
to get the handsome, silver-haired one'as son-
in-law ; but he always seemed oblivious of the
smiles of the local young women, and was
generally in the wake of some big musical
star.
The new Mrs. Sam McCulloch and the brace
of young stepdaughters are said to have be-
come delightfully chummy. Before she became
one of the family, the diplomatic lady skil-
fully set out to win the affection of the two
girls. When the win had been brilliantly
accomplished, she cried, “Behold your pros-
pective mamma !” And they, beholding, fell
upon her fair neck and said, “Why, cer-
tainly !” •
Francis Syme, the farmer among the num-
erous sons of David, has dropped the hoe
tor a while, and is climbing aboard an out-
ward-bound ark, followed by his wife, four
sons, three daughters and two nieces. The
sons are to be left at Edinburgh for educa-
tional purposes, their late grandfather hav-
ing acquired some useful knowledge there.
Mrs. Syme will hover around for a year or
two, designing to pick them up at holiday
time and take them for motor runs about
Europe.
. The Andrew Chirnsides have bought Mel-
ville Park, the Mackays’ Berwick place
mostly inhabited by racehorses and fowls.
Mackay and Mrs. Fan Dango Mackay have
quite settled down to suburban existence in
(if you please) Chapel-street.
The two splendid act-ors were enjoying their
own conversation. A had received several
letters lately from adoring females, “all
ladies, too, by George.” It then appeared
that B also was enormously admiAd by the
fair sex. I-Ie produced the week’s post from
his bosom pocket, and recollected the time
when he received as many missives per diem
from adoring dames and maidens. It was
A s practice, he confessed, to meet foolish
maidens who offered him the devotion of a
lifetime, and gently reprimand them for their
foolish conduct, give them a homily from
the nearest melodrema, and despatch them
to their parents’ arms. “Of course, you do
likewise, B?” said he. “That is my invari-
able custom,” B replied, “my invariable cus-
tom —if they are plain.”
Mrs. Gavan Duffy, daughter of the late
Allan Maclean, has been wandering in foreign
places since her father’s death. She is now
getting back within cooee of Australia.
Major Griffiths, who is our exchange
officer from India, has settled down in a
Melbourne suburb with his wife, some fowls,
a cow, and four polo ponies. The cottage is
handy to the vice-regally blessed Kooyong
Ground, and the old game of horse shinty,
honorably mentioned by the late Omar in his
rhymes, is practised early and late with
fanatical fury.
Two young she-squatters, who will shortly
come of age and be burdened with stations,
have been enlivening Melbourne. They are
orphans, hail from the Back of Beyond, have
just put up their hair, and possess fine coun-
try complexions. An aunt is chaperoning
the jolly and fortunate pair.
The leopard is the latest unfortunate
wild thing to attract the roving eye of de-
stroyer Fashion. An English duchess was
recently sighted snuggling inside a leopard-
skin motor-coat. Now the husband of the
Australian wife who made the discovery
turns pale every time the subject of next
winter’s motor-coat is mentioned. He
doesn’t know what the remarkable garment
would cost and is afraid to ask.
An English Parliamentary committee,
which is inquiring into the sale of proprie-
tary medicines, has discovered a new use
for our old nobility. A peer is a partner
in one of the shadier of these- peddling con-
cerns, and, when he was cautioned about
allowing his name to be advertised in such
a connection, he frankly replied: “What
was I to do for a living?” But the old
nobility’s prices have fallen pretty low nowa-
days. An extra-special Duchess gets only
10s. a week for the use of her name as.
patron of an “Electric Institute.”
Dolly Castles is making headway in
America. She was at latest playing in New
York with the Woods co. An American visi-
tor, commenting on her success, says Aus-
tralians mostly do take in his motherland
(Please read that sentence quietly and re-
frain from stressing the “in.”) Miss Dolly
is the hardworking member of the melodious
family. Hers was originally the smallest
of the Castles voices; but sound teaching
and tireless practice worked the usual
wonders.
A Melbourne man, who is possessed of
much wealth, is now engaged trying to ex-
plain an awkward situation to mamma.
There is a lady with whom mamma does not
get on, and whom Sonny promised to Re-
nounce. The matter was regarded as settled,
and all was well—or would have been, had
not a bothersome “itis” laid the young man
low while he was paying a friendly visit to
the renounced one. The consequent fuss and
flurry disclosed the fact that he hadn’t done
any renouncing worth mentioning. A teacup
cyclone is now understood to be brewing, and
warnings to shipping have been issued by
the weather bureau.
Merrie Boyd, an extremely young member
of the artistic Boyd family, had a glad show
last week of jugs, mugs and bowls fashioned
and fired by himself. He had the bad luck
to also fire the room in which the show was
set out on the very first day. When Society
(about a quarter of the Very Best People
are related to the Boyds) rolled up to the
Centreway lift, a flaring placard of post-
ponement met its eye. The doubly-fired stuff
is, however, now on view. Gum-leaves,
acacia, native bears and parrots are mixed
up _in the designs that enrich the weirdly
artistic vesels. The energetic young potter
has also evolved a new milk jug, which he has
patented. He discovered the special clay
whereof it is made in one of his native gul-
lies, and invented a glazing that makes the
vessel liquid-proof inside, while the outside
is capable of absorbing half its own bulk in
cooling water. He has already been rushed
with orders for this artistic and useful ad-
vance in the domestic milk mug.
Esam, a strikingly original artist of the
Backblocks and its bullocks, has hung some
200 water-colors in Centreway for a fort-
night's gazing. Mallee scrub-rolling gives
him a chance to chase six straining horses
into a frame. “Heading Cattle” is full of
movement, and the dust is so real that the
visitor who looks too long sneezes violently.
Esam loves the nearly extinct coaches that
still creak across the railless solitudes, and
has some fine old specimens for sale. Ex-
cellencies past and present have possessed
themselves at different times of this bush-
artist’s work, and Victor Hood also trea-
sures an example or so.
Early in the New Year the Charles Fair-
bairn family set out for the Continent, where
the nations rage together. The heads of the
family will escape the tedium of the long,
familiar voyage by travelling via America,
whilst daughter Esther apd the youngest of
the late Dr. Robertson’s five daughters will
mother the Fairbairn babies through the
heat of the Red Sea.
The Bowes Kelly matron having become
invalided, the family’s annual flight to its
acres in the island speck has been postponed.
Meanwhile, the hundred-odd trunks yawn
emptily in the attics, until such time as the
doctor’s motor ceases to stand at the door.
The George Tallis couple and J. C. Wil-
liamson have started on the return journey
to Australia, rt® Canada. Mrs. Williamson
is remaining in Rome to look after daughter
Marjorie, who is to spend another year or
so acquiring a high Continental polish.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Henley-on-Torrens eventuated in blithering heat.
Still, the large section which doesn’t mind taking
its pleasures swelteringiy—provided cool drinks are
handy to act the part of antidotes —rolled up, and
both banks were crowded. Of the racing—but who
ever watches the racing at a regatta? The Adelaide
Club and the Adelaide Bowing Club had marquees
wherein they entertained their friends, and “Sas-
siety” rolled up in force. Mrs. Mayoress Parsons,
one of the judges, wore a smart costume—blue
striped ninon, veiling white, and a hat which hinted
of Paris. In the competition for decorated water
vehicles the Kookaburra Ladies’ Rowing Club ap-
propriated the first prize with an apricot and black
■design, and Miss Linda Champion’s Crescent came
second.
The Blind, Deaf and Dumb Asylum has benefited to
the extent of £2OOO from the money left by the
late ex-Mavoress E. T. Smith.
The advance guard of the Denman polo team- —15
ponies—arrived on Tuesday. The programme ran this
way: Polo, Thursday; an amateur variety show,
Thursday night; a dinner, Friday night; more
polo, Saturday. After which our visitors hurry off
to lead the strenuous life somewhere else. The Gov-
ernor-General and the faithful Lord Dicky stay at
Marble Hill; the rest of the party endure the rigors
<of the Adelaide Club.
The incoming mail has on board Mrs. Girdlestone,
the George Milnes and their daughters and Miss Jean
Stirling. The Woodheads, from Gilberton, leave by
the Orama, for England, next. week.
The Deutscher Verein celebrated Christmas at the
May Club on Mondhy evening. It was a stifling
night—a night for repose, and peace, and good
fellowship and beer —especially beer.
Judge Gordon’s leave of absence has been further
•extended by two months —which carries him to the
■end of the vacation. Meanwhile, he continues to con-
valesce at Kangaroo Island.
Mr. G. W. Purvis died at Woodville on Thursday,
aged 91. He was a colonist since ’52, and was con-
■cerned with the building of the old wooden light-
houses on the Semaphore and Glenelg ietties, and
also with the tide-gauge at the former place. His
grandfather, Brigadier-General Walker, fought at
Waterloo.
Another of the 'G. H. Dean sons is married—“ Ted,”
the second one. The bride was Miss Grieve, of Glen
Osmond. The Dean-Gordon wedding is to be early
in the New Year.
The University disbanded, or went down, or broke
up, or did whatever such institutions do when they
take a holiday, on Wednesday. Amongst other things
™o„P b , all ? e J ,or - Chipf Justice Way, announced that
£2OO had been received from Miss Bundey to found
a prize in memory of her father, the late Justice
Bundev, and his wife. The award is to he given for
English verse-making, a job at which Miss Bundey
is no slouch herself.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
“Hassan’’; In a recent case at Dayles-
ford (vie.) a man named Herod was fined
a *? d ° to pay £1 4s. 6d. damages
and ±5 ss. costs, for throwing bottles about
a bar. The massacre instinct is evidently
still strong in the Herods. Compared with
the original and historic crime in Judaea the
recent outburst was, no doubt, more humane,
but it was also more unjustifiable. Bottles do
not make a noise and wake the household up
at nights. They stand, cool and reserved and
silent, on the sideboard or in the cellar, and
the only sound they ever make is the cheer-
ful cry they give when the corks are drawn.
It was a dastardly thing, therefore, to slay
a bottle; and the fine was really very light
upon this descendant of the deceased
tetrarch. ,

POLITICAL
POINTS
The other day McCutcheon, of St. Ivilda,
the most hopeless reactionary in the Cab-
bage Garden’s politics, upended himself to
animadvert on the “excessive expenditure in
the Education Department”—the most
starved branch of the Victorian public ser-
vice. He holds a quaint notion that “per-
sons who could well afford to pay are get-
ting their children taught free,” regardless
of the fact that the State pays and there-
fore every citizen pays. Thus McCutcheon’s
bachelor nephew and his maiden aunt pro-
vide some portion of the education money,
and so far have made no great song about
it. A _ lot of other people also contribute
something towards the University education
of McCutch’s children, but the foolish person
probably forgot that. His idea is that if
“steps were taken to compel those who could
afford it to pay, £750,000 a year could easily
be raised.” Quite easily ! Or £7,000,000 for
that matter. And the children of those who
couldn’t afford to pay—a 545.-a-week boot-
maker working half-time, for instance —-
would be just as easily branded as paupers.
Millard, M.L.A., at Blayney (N.S.W.),
the other night, as follows: —
I have been a consistent member of the Liberal
party for the past 19 years, and during that time I have
been as free as the wind to exercise my right of judg-
ment with reference to any and every political ques-
tion affecting the interests of my constituency and
the country at large.
What would happen to the Liberal who pub-
licly favored an affirmative vote on the Re-
ferenda questions, or a Federal Land Tax,
or the “eviction” of Lord Denman, or any
other measure that had been duly damned
by his party caucus and press? The grim
fate of Speaker Willis, and of the man who
was chased for 19 years by mad jackals,
would be his for a certainty.
The sharebroker, being a sort of non-pro-
ductive parasite on the Fatman, naturally
barracks for what will make the Fatman
fatter and his own commissions more corpu-
lent. Hence J. Palmer and Sons (Sydney) :
Commonwealth politicians are trying to work up
an anti-trust mania.... The combines in Australia
have been beneficial to the public. .. .The fact
is, it is essential to the existence of a combine that
it be beneficial to the community. Directly it
misuses its power it exposes itself to competition and
is bound to come to grief, and there is no need for
legislation or prosecution to accomplish or hasten
its inevitable fate.
Quite easy, of course. Says a butcher:
“Hullo, here’s a meat ring, which has
pushed up the price of chops too high. I
can sell cheaper. I’ll start business.” He
starts, sells cheaper, and the ring, which has
the bloated profits of the past behind it,
doesn’t do a thing, of course, to the little
man.
The extraordinary demands made by
Cameron, Tasmania’s one Independent, as
the price of his support of Labor on a want-
of-confidence motion, indicate very clearly
the pass to which things may readily be
brought under our beautiful system of party
government. Among other things, Cam-
eron had the enormous assurance to ask that
all legislation of every kind should be hung
up until after the first week in September,
1913, and that no wages of any State em-
ployees should be raised. What kind of re-
presentative is this Cameron person who
can advocate that the Assembly shall do
nothing at all to earn its screw for nine
months, and at the same time insist that no
higher pay shall be given to those %vho are
actually doing the State’s work?
MERELY DESIRED A FUNERAL.
However much we may disagree with the trend of
Labor policy, it is to the. disadvantage of everyone to
attempt to make political capital out of the financial
trouble in which the present administration has in-
volved itself. —S. M. Herald.
GRANNY: “ It’s not political capital we want to
make out of it. A mere writ of habeas
corpus will do, won't it, dear?”
In these days of furious talk about the
“disloyalty” of a Government which desires
to make some use of N.S.W. Government
House grounds, it is worth recalling that
Governor Bourke, as far back as November,
1832, sent a despatch to Yiscount Goderich
urging the necessity of appropriating a large
part of the land —for wharves. He also in-
dicated the rapid growth of the city in the
direction of Farm Cove, and urged that
portion of what was called the Governor’s
domain should be thrown open for occupation.
Bourke’s own idea was to make that a resi-
dential area, with a convenient and ample
six or seven acres reserved for Government
House in the centre. He thought it prepos-
terous to hold for merely nominal use so
many acres attached to what would in time
be a town house. In these circumstances,
William McLinen and his tag-rag party,
instead of throwing all the mud at
McGowen, might take an afternoon off and
aim a bit at the statue of the dreadful dis-
loyalist Governor Bourke, standing in front
of the Mitchell Library.
THE ETCHERS.
We believe in making more comprehensive the im-
mediate aims of Liberal policy, and in passing laws
for the betterment of wage-earners as well as of other
kinds of workers. What is there to prevent any
disinterested patriot supporting a party of that kind?
And when these find their class bondage more than
they can bear, and determine, like Mr. Beeby, to
break loose, there is no need, etc., etc.
-Sydney Telegraph.
HIS LADY F RIEND: “ Well, arter me goin' ter
th' trouble to — er— borrer this new bait , we
orter catch somethink some day, don’ teher
think so,?”
The Commonwealth’s old-age pensions still
worry those who have to administer the
business. A new Amending Bill straightens
out some crooked matters, but leaves many
problems still to be faced.
Thus, old John Smith can
own his house where he
permanently resides, and
lose no pension on that
account; but if he should
let the house and use the
rent to pay for another,
his income goes down at
once. This, may be a
serious hardship, for John
might want to move to
some place where his son
or his daughter lives, or
to be handy to the surf or
a picture-show, or make
some other move grateful
to his old age; but even
under the Amending Bill
he can only do it by for-
feiting the little screw
the Commonwealth allows
him for wearing grey
whiskers. And it doesn’t
look as if such troubles
will be avoided until the
annuities are made uni-
versal, and paid without
argument once the citizen
reaches the pension age.
The cranks who say that Australia needn’t
worry about Defence because war doesn’t
pay are up against a contradiction in the
case of the Italian grab at Tripoli. The
gore-sprinkled business cost Italy £40,000
per day for 12 months ; and as a result the
Italians get their new African estate for
less than £18,000,000. And that even in-
cludes the capital necessary to produce the
£BO,OOO a year which is to be paid to Tur-
key—poor, old, unprepared Turkey.
THE TAG .
As was to be expected, Vic-
toria’s House of “Review” tossed
out Willie Watt’s timid little Bill
providing that municipal councils
might levy their rates on the un-
improved value of land, if thev un-
accountably felt so disposed, or if
a majority of ratepayers ordered
them to do so by referendum. The
man or institution which to-dav
holds large areas idle for specula-
tive purposes pays a mere trifle in
rates, while the “small” man along-
side who dwells on his block and
has improved it to the uttermost
and thus shown himself a desir-
able citizen and an advantage to
the country, is taxed and super-
taxed for every improvement he
adds. The obvious honesty and
advantage of the new proposal so
struck the House of Land Monopo-
lists that it wouldn’t even allow
the ratepayers to say whether thev
approved of it or not.
In addition to the many oil paint-
ings of the fathers, step-fathers,
foster-fathers and grandfathers of
Federation to be painted by Aus-
tralian artists for the National
Memorial Ilall, a big picture of the
Yassberra capital site has been
ordered from a Sydney brush. The
gentlemen entrusted with the busi-
ness of handing out the jobs were
at first much inclined to give the
commission to a well-known water-colorist,
but changed their minds at the last moment,
influenced, no doubt, by the suspicion that
there might not be enough water at Yass-
Can to allow the artist to moisten his colors.
“ OUTRAGE .”
It has apparently proceeded upon the principle of
cutting off the highest heads. Let a man have put
money into a pastoral or agricultural enterprise, let
him have risked a possibly hazardous investment in
land of any sort, and he is forthwith penalised. The
Federal land tax has fallen alike on the just and the
unjust.—S.M.H., vaguely, on Labor taxation,
An art exhibit from the S. M. HERALD'S
Chamber of Political Eforrors.
The farmer who is told that he has no-
thing to gain by Protection has the doubtful
joy of seeing freights up to a higher point
than they have soared to for the past 15
years. The cry of the foreign trader is that
Australia should just grow wheat and wool
and not worry about manufactures. So, on
account of an inadequate tariff, millions go
every year to pay for the goods that are
made in other countries ; and the Australian
farmer’s wheat has to be
dragged across the globe to
feed the foreign workman
and help to pay for the for-
eign goods. And the drag-
ging—which is quite. un-
necessary because practically
all the manufactured _ goods
might be made here —is this
year costing the farmer 50s.
a ton, or (say) Is. 3d. per
bushel. In other words, for all
his year’s labor and outlay,
the Australian farmer gets
3s. 3d. per bushel, while for
the mere carting of the stuff
to Europe, the shipowner gets
Is. 3d. Certainly Is. 3d. per
bushel is a most inflated
charge, in any case ; but the
inflation is due very largely
to the shipping ring. Rings,
trusts and combines are kind
things which, the farmer may
remember, his josses of the
“Liberal” party are begging
him not to empower the Na-
tional Government to con-
trol. He may be an ass and
listen to those josses; hut, if he thinks of
the Is. 3d. per bushel he will probably whack
them instead.
“ADVANCE AUSTRALIA!”
[For The Bulletin.]
The national motto, camerados!
Presumably our guiding idea....
You, my good sir, what are you doing to advance
Australia ?
Do you eat three large meals for your country?
Do you imbibe nine, or nineteen, assorted drinks for
her?
Do you sell saucepans, silk or sausages to advance
Australia ?
Do you smoke coarse-cut tobacco or shilling cigars
to advance Australia?
Do you take Aspasia to the picture show from pat-
riotic motives, or conduct Corima to the matinfie
to advance Australia?
Do you visit Flemington, Onkaparinga, or Randwick,
in order to assist the pushing ahead of this fine
and large country?
Do you attend church, chapel or other brain-soften-
ing function to advance Australia?
Do you, upon the following morning, advance, or help
to advance, the price of saucepans, silk or
sausages, in order to advance Australia ?
My good sir, Australia is not advancing when you eat
four large meals a day.
The camerados deny that you are helping Australia
to advance just because you have increased the
price of your saucepans, or silk or sausages.
Four winners in one afternoon, and an expensive
supper at night, do not advance Australia one
inch.
Because now you wear seven-guinea suits and live
in style, do you think you help to advance
Australia ?
I do not consider, nor do the camerados consider,
that Australia is advancing just because the
Cost of Living keeps on advancing!
I do not consider, nor do the camerados consider,
that Australia is advancing, just because an
accommodating Uncle keeps on advancing !
You inquire, llow can I advance Australia?
Think, my good sir, think!
Faith may move mountains, but Thought will shift
a continent —this continent!. .. .
And you, my dear madam?
In what way are you helping to advance Australia?
Do you wear all those gaudy importations to advance
Australia?
Do you 1011, and chat, and laugh, and grow fat, and
monopolise the telephone in order to advance
Australia ?
Do you motor to the Block, or tram it to the sales,, to
advance Australia?
Do you spend a week’s housekeeping money on a
flimsy gew-gaw to advance Australia?
Do you storm the drug shops, the drapers and the
dining-rooms to advance Australia?
Do you powder and paint, and mince and giggle, and
constrict your diaphragms, your hands and your
feet in order to advance Australia?
Do you lavish time, money and affection on curious
canines to advance Australia?
I do not consider, nor do the camerados consider, that
Australia is advancing because the number of
drapers’ shops is advancing.
A riot of drapery sales, and a furious orgy of fluff
and feathers, paper flowers and hatpins cannot
advance Australia.
First-nights, chocolates, silk scarves, late suppers, and
expensive perfumes will never advance Aus-
tralia !
You do not inquire, my dear madam, “How I can
advance Australia?”
Why should you?
But you might advance. us a few more good Aus-
tralians.
You might exhibit less powder and a little more
patriotism.
Remember, that you can best help to advance Aus-
tralia by inspiriting the man who loves you to
do something to advance Australia!
And I salute you 1

In the long list of Summer Beverages, very few have any genuine claims
to consideration from a health point of view. SARILLA is non-alcoholic,
and is composed chiefly of Jamaica Sarsaparilla, the blood-purifying and
beneficial value of which is acknowledged the whole world over. SARILLA
fulfils the most stringent requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia. It
satisfies the thirst, is good for the health, and is as good for children as for
adults.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
James Neil Campbell, of Britain, is a
brave man. First, he earns his crust as an aeronaut,
which is a game in which quitters do not make big
incomes. Then, as if not satisfied with, the perils of
his ordinary avocation, he married three ladies —a
performance which stamps him as one of the bravest
of the brave. The Judge who tried the case re-
marked hopelessly: “Apparently no one knows how
you are married, or to how many” ! Campbell re-
plied, cheerfully: “I’m only married to three, sir!”
He seemed to be almost ashamed of his modesty.
Yet he was a kindly soul. He said he would do his
best to produce the death certificate of his first wife,
a Sydney woman, but added, feelingly: “I hope she
is not dead, for I spent some very happy years with
her.” Finally, by some weird stroke of tne law, he
got out of the charge of bigamy, and merely fell in
for a month for making a false declaration in the
marriage certificate of his third bride.
* * * *
Melbourne Argus discovered a new and
rising cricketer the other day. Giving the names of
Ma’s team for the Boxing Day inter-State cricket
match, it mentioned Truinper, Wadd.y, Minnett, etc.,
and then, to make up the eleven, A. N. Other. But
there are really 12 in that team, the last man being
S. Undries.
* * * *
“Vagabond” : I’d like to recommend to the
water-sports of Australia in search of an exciting
craft the native Philippine “banea” or canoe. It
is simply a log of wood shaped to sharp ends and
dug out to a shell. When the crew is aboard the
gunT is about seven-eighths of a hairsbreadth from
the water’s edge. It is propelled by paddles, some-
times fixed in a makeshift sort of rowlock made of a
bit of twisted cane, and pulled oar fashion. These
“bancas” give points to a racing eight in the bal-
ancing they require. Their nigger crews take them
out into the open sea and they ride over the waves
like a swimming sea-gull. Certainly they slop some
water aboard in choppy waves, but, being one piece
of wood, it doesn’t matter if they do fill. Not know-
ing this peculiarity, I was sitting in considerable
perturbation and a pair of soaked trousers waiting
for the craft to founder the first time I made a trip
in one. Nothing happened, however, and we reached
the end of a three-mile paddle in safetv, though the
water was up to the waist line. Taking it all round,
I think the banca the nearest to the poetry of
motion in water-craft that I’ve floated in, and when
I get hack to Sydney Harbor I’ll see if I can’t im-
port a specimen to take the girls picnicking in.
But they’ll have to parade for it in Canadian cos-
tumes, and the lunch basket and billy will have to
wear a waterproof diving suit.

A good semi-final struggle is always a
glorious thing, and the one for the President’s
Trophy of the Victorian Bowling Association,
last week, would be hard to beat. The
outed clubs were Camberwell, which fell to
North Fitzrov, the holder of the trophy, and
Carlton, which went down before Essendon. The
interesting feature of the struggle was the equality
of the showing of the two victors, North Fitzroy
scoring 48 to Camberwell’s 31, and Essendon rolled
up 49 to Carlton’s 36. If the two left in don’t have
some excitement in the final, then there is nothing in
form.
* * * *
There are lurid stories floating around re-
garding the goings-on of a section of the Australian
XI. The team was divided into two lots, and between
them was a great gulf, that was never bridged even
when they were travelling together. According to
report, one section consisted of the men who knew
how to conduct themselves ; the other of hogs, who
put both feet in the trough—hoodlums who were
thrown out of hotels and cafSs for using bullocky
language to waitresses ; who requested total strangers
to pass the crimson bread; and who spoke of the
other portion of the team as the vermilion *****
elite. Whether this dissension had any bad effect on
the playing is hard to say, but it is a moral cer-
tainty that it did it no good. The scandal is to be
investigated by a committee appointed by the Board
of Control, and there is considerable agitation to have
the inquiry held with open doors, so that it mav be
reported by the press so far as the press dare report
it. If only half of what is told is true, the time has
come to make an example of the gentrv who have
disgraced both the country and the Board of Control.
Provided he doesn’t burst his hatband,
Melbourne University cricketer Hartkopf is a slogger
with a gay future before him. When ’Varsity went
up against St. Kilda, Hartkopf smote 138 of the
Students’ 232 ; then, feeling still hungry, he came
against Sydney Uni., and smacked the top scores, 58
and 78 respectively. There should be quite a number of
vacancies in the Australian XI shortly, and it is
pleasant to have bright colts of the Hartkopf stand-
ard to fill the gaps.
S. Aus. cricket is faced with a not un-
common difficulty, a lack of young bowlers. Murray,
Moyes, Steele and Gooden all look capable of any-
thing with the bat, but there is nobody promising
to help Crawford, Whitty and Rees with the ball,
unless it is Len Chamberlain —and he is no novice.
The S.A. Cricket Association has, therefore, pro-
moted a competition for young bowlers, each of whom
had to send down a few overs to Clem Hill, Gehrs
and Claxton, with Crawford, Campbell and Travers
.judging'. There were lots of entries, and the winner
was Riley, son of the association’s secretary, and a
schoolboy at St. Peter’s College. After which he
went into the field against Prince Alfred College,
and on a bowler’s wicket took 0 for 30 and three
for 31, while unconsidered school mates took six for
56 and six for 48. Such is cricket. In this match,
Hon Steele, who .was given an inter-State game a
year ago, made in the P.A.C. first innings a beautiful
120, while his 10 companions together amassed 37.
It is the seventh year he has been chosen for his
school, and opposing barraekers asked scornfully
whether he has not yet qualified for his old age
pension.
The cricket umpire got badly ruled out at
the recent meeting of the N.S.W. Cricket Association
when W. It. Jones, representing the North Sydney
club, moved, by his deputy, that the screw of um-
pires officiating in the State be £1 per day
in inter-State matches and in matches against Eng-
land or S’Africa, the total sum of such payment not
to exceed £lO. It was bad enough to reduce the
screw from £2 per day to £l, but some of the
delegates rose to remark that a few of the umpires
were not worth even £1 per day. That hurt, especi-
ally (and extraordinarily) as the motion was carried.

N.S.W. Cricket Association’s treasurer
Green rose with a frown at the last meeting and
warned members that there were breakers ahead.
They had started the year with £4OBO to credit, but
in six months they had galloped through £2564, and
of the £1516 still left a lot was ear-marked to make
good deficits that were already hovering on the
horizon. They were paying out £lOO there, and
£2OO here, and there was mighty little coming in;
so the time was dead-ripe to slow down and go
cautiously, and look at every bob twice before paying
out. There would be no English team coming out
for some time, and before then a team had to be sent
to S’Africa, and that would cost a bean or two.
Distinctly, it is time to slow down.

That picturesque actor, Allen Doone, set
out to establish a motor-car record betwkeen Ade-
laide and Sydney last week. But Doone’s luck was
out. Everything went well till they entered N. S.
Wales, and then the 40-h.p. machine began to bump
the shire councillor’s idea of a main road. Eight
miles on the Sydney side of Albury a wheel smashed,
and Doone threw up his idea of making a record.
But, wishing to see the country, he paddled along in
the car as far as Picton, where a tyre blew out, and
the idea of a record-manufacture was definitely
dropped. It was hard luck for one so beautiful.
Of course plenty of people have made the Adelaide-
Sydney run, but without thought of a record. Two
months ago Dr. McKay, of Broken Hill, and his wife
set out from the big naming town in a Ford run-
about. They went to Adelaide, 350 miles or there-
abouts ; thence to MeUiourne; thence on to Sydney;
then back via the South Coast to Melbourne, calling
in at Kosciusko on the way; and, after having a
look at the Cup, they cut north through Bendigo and
Wentworth, and got home with no worse mishaps than
a couple of punctures. The total distance covered
was about 3000 miles, much of it over bush tracks.

The back-light problem has cropped up
again in a Melbourne motoring case. The defendant
was a doctor, and made no attempt to get awav when
hailed by the constable, who asked him why he had
no tail-light. The doctor seemed surprised. He
had lit the thing before starting, and presumed that
a heavy bump over a deep rut a little way back had
put it out. As the doctor said, when driving
through crowded streets it is very difficult to keep
a watch on the tail-light; and if the Act is to be
rigidly enforced, it means that improved lamps will
have to be put on, lit bv either acetylene or elec-
tricity which runs to an outlay of something between
£4O and £5O. The Bench expressed sympathy with
the doctor, but fined him 10s., and endorsed his
license. The Law had to be upheld. Here, then, is
a job for some brilliant young inventor—-to produce
a tail-light which won’t cost £4O or £5O, and yet
will be reliable. And if the driver can get a warning
in the event of anything going wrong with it, so
much the better.

The United States automobile builders
have swamped the Olymp’a Exhibition (London)
with cheap cars ranging from £95 to £220. The
average is £l6O to £lBO, for which the Yankee
supplies a car that looks well and runs well.
Whether it will stand well is another matter. Most
Yankee machinery is not built to last longer than
the development and marketing of the first im-
provement. The English maker is now announcing
that he, too, in the near future, will supply low-
priced cars. But the Trust is at work, and as the
price of cars goes down the cost of petrol rushes
up, and a further rise to 2s. is threatened as a
New Year gift. There’s a fortune for the man
who can devise a cheap substitute for petrol. One
is being tried, a mixture of benzol and alcohol.
Benzol is a distillate of crude naphtha, a coal-tar
by-product. Alcohol can be made by wood and
vegetable distillation at Id. per gallon; but there
seems to be trouble with Excise people all over the
world, which makes it impossible to put this cheap
and efficient substitute for petrol on the market in
huge supplies. Presumably the Trust, a huge, inter-
national and shameless octopus, uses its influence
to maintain vexatious regulations which, under exist-
ing circs., are an ironclad wall of defence to its
flagrant monopoly.
More than a chance that Australia may
be extensively represented at the big cycling road
races of Europe next season, as Don Kirkham, J.
Wilson (both Vic.) and F. Keefe (Tas.) are said to
contemplate a raid on the French events. Road
racing in France and Germany is quite a business,
from which the rider makes a decent income apart
from prizes he may win. The best riders are all
under engagement to manufacturing houses, who not
only pay them well, but make elaborate arrangements
for their training, mounting and feeding. In fact,
it is almost as good to be a racing cyclist in France
or Germany as a racehorse in Australia.

They seem to have got Australian sculling
champion Pearce in a cleft stick. The rules gov-
erning the championship lay it down that any holder
must defend his title when called upon to do so
within two months of the date of the challenge.
Pearce is booked to row Barry for the championship
of the planet on the Thames. Immediately he
arranged to go he was called on to defend his Aus-
tralian title. He declined, as he had other fish to
fry, and could not attend to two fryingpans at once.
The challengers persist, and it is now said that they
will, in the event of Pearce refusing to row, demand
that he forfeit and let them row among themselves
for the vacant place. Pearce says he will neither row
nor forfeit, though how he can avoid one or the other
it is hard to see. It is understood that if he declines
to row, the championship will be declared vacant,
and Charles Towns and Felton will race for the
empty place and £2OO aside. Under the rule the
championship will be vacant shortly after Christmas ;
and as Pearce does not leave Australia till February,
he may attack the winner and pick him clean before
he goes* to measure himself with Barry.
Let us rejoice! The Australian eight-oar
crew to Stockholm returned with £4O still intact in
the team purse. The good management must have
been absolutely monumental, as the purse was not
over-full wiien the crowd went away. The Henley
Cup, won by defeating the Leander on the Thames, is
due to arrive in January.
J. C. Parke, the top-notcher of the British
tennis team, put up a tall record in Australia by losing
only one set of II played. And consider the quality
of his scalps—Brookes and Heath (Vic), A. B. Jones
(N.S.W.), and St. John (Q.). The match between
Britain and Australia, at Sydney, on January 17,
will see him again matched with Brookes, and the
contest will be worth going far to see.
* * * »
The Davis Cup contests in Melbourne
gathered from the crowd close upon £3OOO in gate
fees. Ihe exes., including £9OO for the erection of
a temporary stand, do not nearly mop up the whole
amount, and it is believed there will be a profit of
(say) £l3OO. Of this, about £6OO goes to England.
England is on a good wicket, as Australia’s share
of the profits of the games held there in 1907 was
a miserable £l3l Bs. 4d. This year the English
body gets it all back, about five times over.
Jack Johnson is not cursed with an imag-
ination. When he got out of the charge of having
abducted Lucille Cameron, on the ground that the
youftg lady was sufficiently old to decide whether
she would go to the devil or not, he married the
girl—in the same room in which his just-buried first
wife had committed suicide. Lucille, apparently,
has no overplus of imagination either. The public
was very wroth, and talked loudly of lynching the
cynical black with the gold-lined mouth. But, as
usual in Chicago, nothing happened; and Johnson
started to take his wife round openly. When they
entered a caf6 the other evening, the manager hur-
ried forward and informed them they would not be
allowed to stay. Johnson withdrew, leaving his wife
to enjoy the advantages of her color. But the man-
agement was obdurate. Mrs. Johnson must leave,
too. As she did so, the manager is said to have
remarked: “A few more incidents of this sort and
you will understand why the first Mrs. Johnson
suicided!” It was pretty brutal; but the girl de-
served it.
The bi-colored marriage is a horror which hits out
in some unexpected ways. Some time ago a wealthy
New Yorker fell in love with one of his type-ladies,
and proposed marriage. She accepted him, and in-
formed him that, although under 30, she had been
already married, borne two children, buried them
both and divorced her husband, Felix P. Jackson, or
some " such thing. This tragic history endeared the
lady more than ever to her new admirer, and with
the idea of blotting sad memories away he never
asked her anything about Felix P. Jackson—not for
a long time; not till a baby came home: a baby
with white skin but negro features. There was no
negro blood in the arteries of that infant, but he
bore the brand of his mother’s early shame.
At the Sydney Stadium last week O’Grady
supplied another excellent illustration for the old
couplet—“He who fights and runs away, lives to
fight another day.” Leon Bernstein was the pursuer
on this occasion, and also the victim; for O’Grady
hit him often and hard, but invariably bolted before
he could get anything in return. Indeed, his back
was scarred from slithering along the ropes in his
wild crab-rush out of danger. The exasperated
Frenchman at the opening of the ball was quite fast
enough to keep up with the Donaldson of the Ring,
and he did it; but he received some vicious upper-
cuts that caused him to slow down for breath,
and stand right off for a while, after which he made
further advances only with the utmost caution. In
the 14th round he caught O’Grady. He was running
when he got hit, and before the Hibernian knew
what had happened he was on his back. It
was a bad floor bump, but at nine O’Grady
struggled up, and took another smasher which
sent him down for four more. Hardly was
he up again before he once more went down for
three, and when he came up still another time, Ber-
stein stood in to kill. Instead, however, of doing
anything of the sort, he stopped a vicious uppercut
which rocked him, steadied him down, and gave the
Australian a respite till the sound of the gong.
Bernstein had missed his chance. Nothing else
of consequence happened till the last round,
after which a majority vote gave O’Grady the
verdict, and the G°’d retired, remarking that the
times were out of joint.

Maoriland Treasury last year drew
£75,611 from the tax on Totalisator investments.
It was a goodly sum with which the Government
could well do and which the punter never missed.
The chief contributor was the Auckland province,
£9502. Canterbury came next with £8046, Well-
ington £5280, little Wanganui £3599, and the
Metropolitan Trotting Club £5039. The rest was
made up by the other 13 clubs on a descending scale.

N.S.'W. football for the coming season
will be of the stay-at-home order. The N.S.W. Rugby
League asked the Northern Union to send out a team,
but the English, for some reason, declined the invita-
tion. The Rugby Union will neither receive visitors nor
send them, and the talk about wild activity in foreign
parts by the Soccer crowd turns out to have been
mere flaim. The Soccer chiefs will wisely devote their
energies to developing the inter-State side of their
attractive game. The chief excitement will be the
wild-cattle rush for the playing grounds.
Another swimming marvel bobbed up at
Manly (Sydney) the other day, in Churchill Cracken-
thorp, a water-sprite of 13 summers. He fulfilled the
Royal Life Saving Society’s conditions by swimming
over or through 600 yards, fully dressed, in 14min.
54sec.—3min. 6sec. under the society’s standard.

Wootton, sen., back in Australia, attrib-
utes the occasional suspension of son Frank to the
jealousy of the other jockeys, who want to get him
into bad odor with the stewards at any cost. As he
ascribes the success of Australian riders in Eng-
land to the very fact that they “possess more devil,
and will take more risks,” the reason for an occasional
protest becomes obvious. Younger son Stanley was
brother Frank’s effective deputy while the latter was
off duty, winning 10 races. Frank’s income is the
comfortable one of £4500 certain, in retainers, and
5 per cent, of stakes won, which may come to

When Ethe \bert Ambrook Southee, the
Ma State s new Rhodes scholar, leaves for Oxford
N.S.W. will see the last for a time of one of its
best all-round athletes. In one day he recently
bagged the State and Australasian championships for
a broad jump, for a 220-yard sprint and a few othe-
tnfles. Besides that, he has the Sydney High School
Cup tor best all-round athlete in his year. At the
University he is president or sec. of just about
everything that has a president or sec., and a
in football; so when he sets out for the Fog the
Uuiversit.y will be busy with by-elections for a
month. Southee was born in Cootamundra ‘ ? 2 years

Frank K. Kerr, the Victorian Rhodes
Scholar, goes away after having taken as bio- a bite
as he can chew out of Victorian athletic champion-
ships. He has won the University mile champion-
ship four times, the inter-Uni. mile and half-mile
championships, the five-mile eross-countrv champion-
ship in record time, the inter-collegiate mile four
times. He has a '‘blue” for cricket, football and
athletics, and captained Queen’s College cricket and
football for four years. In the brains line he has
an almost equal collection of scholarships and prizes,
and has done it all in 23 years.

Cabled dead, the racehorse Common, in
his 25th year. He was one of the few that won the
sporting triple crown—the Two Thousand Guineas,
Derby and St. Leger. More extraordinary, he was de-
feated only once. When he retired from the track
he was purchased by sportsman Blundell Maple for
£15,000 for the stud. It was a bad spec, as Com-
mon was, comparatively speaking, a failure in that
department.
Bill Sikes lias been taking more than a
passing interest in cricket trophies lately. Re-
cently he relieved C. G. Macartney of the best part
of his English tour mementoes ; now he has made a
considerable hole in Clem Hill’s large pile.
Australian runner A. B. Postle some time
ago made for S’Africa, where they take more interest
in running than we do in Australia. At latest he was
in Jo’burg, and had met something like disaster,
having been outrun by R. E. Walker, the African
champion, in a match over 100 yards. Walker won
by two yards, in 9 3-ssec. The time is equal to that
once put up by that busted champion, Arthur Duffey,
the Yankee flier who was disqualified for admitting
that he did what everybody knew he did. It is a
record for the world. Probably some cave-man fled
faster when the dinosaur was close behind, but the
timekeeper left also, and the event was not chronicled.
If the punter ever had any doubts as to
his being an ass, the question should be settled by
an analysis of what the bookmaker hands the Sydney
metropolitan racing clubs. Of the £137,000' paid
out by the clubs in the shape of added money, no
less than £59,100 was contributed by Patrick
O’Scariot in ring fees. And if O’Scariot pays that
huge sum merely to be allowed to get his teeth into
the punter, what fat bacon those punter boobs must
be! Isn’t it time the State took a hand in the game,
and insisted that if these punting boobs will lose
their cash it shall be lost to the State and used for
public purposes?

Carter, Adelaide’s best-known football
umpire, has had the courage to claim legal damages
from a particularly dogged barracker, who stupidly
went into details: “You are a cheat,” “This man
bets,” and so on. But somehow hard words lose
their sting with the lapse of time, and when the law-
suit came on, full three months after the insult, it
was “settled on satisfactory terms” (not made pub-
lic), “all imputations of unfairness withdrawn.”
The chief item of interest was Carter’s statement
that he “had orders to keep away from people, and
was forbidden to be drawn into conversation with
anybody at all concerning football.” “Were you
under orders from the League to shun the society of
your fellow-men?” counsel asked; and the boss
whistler replied mournfully: “Yes. An umpire has
no friends at all.”

In a recent fight With S. Burns in Londbn,
Johnnie Summers prayed earnestly in the ring during
the interval. — Cable.
The hoxer dumped him down to pray,
His seconds flapped the tow’l.
The blokes who went to see the play
Of gory mits had words to say—
They said ’em with a howl.
For by the rules ’tis clearly shown
A pug should battle on his own.
The holy lad put up his dukes,
And waded in like Ilell.
He landed with some frightful flukes.
And hooked most punishing rebukes
Whenever it befell
That Burns in his defence was weak,
Or if he turned the other cheek.
Good Johnnie prayed for help to shift
His rival’s ear awry.
His voice in thankfulness he’d lift
Each time the other’s nose was biffed,
Or when lie bunged an eye,
And when with uppercuts he scored
Most piously he praised the Lord.
The scrap was o’er; with eyes a-glare
Poor Burns was down and dumb.
The referee then said that where
Two lads were matched it wasn’t square
To ring in Kingdom Come.
Amid a great, applauding howl
Said he: “It’s Burns’s, on a foul!”

A CHOKING CHILD.
CONVULSIONS AND BLACK IN THE
FACE FROM STOMACH WORMS.
FIVE EXPELLED BY ONE DOSE.
The terrible sufferings which a child
afflicted with stomach worms has endured is
told in this statement made by Mrs, C. A.
Madden, of Kurrajong, N.S.W. Her little
boy, at the age of 16 months, became very
irritable and cross, and the doctor attri-
buted the cause to stomach worms. The
child became so bad that on three or four
occasions it; went into convulsions and almost
choked, owing to the worms passing up to
the throat. Various treatments were tried,
with practically no success, until Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets were used with
the following marvellous results. These are
Mrs. Madden’s own words: —“For some six
months,” writes Mrs. C. A. Madden, of Kur-
rajong, N.S.W., “my little boy, now aged
one year and ten months, has suffered from
Stomach Worms, which the doctor attri-
buted to the use of impure water. Until he
was 16 months old he enjoyed very good
health, but subsequently he became very
irritable and cross, and, later on, he was ex-
amined by a doctor, who stated that the
cause was Stomach Worms. Various treat-
ments were tried, and on one occasion a
Stomach Worm was passed from the
bowels. The evacuations from the bowels
were always stained with blood, and the
motions were quite unnatural. On three or
four occasions the child was almost choked,
and went into convulsions, and almost black
in the face, through the worm passing up
the throat, and I had to force my finger down
the throat to remove the worm. Only last
week I was strongly advised to try Com-
stock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, and hav-
ing obtained a box, I gave the child a dose
in accordance with the instructions, and the
same evening five worms, varying in length,
the longest 15 inches, were expelled.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication of Worms in children and adults.

WHY YOU NEED SPECIAL EXERCISES.
dsf
To get beneficial results from Exercise, it’s necessary that the
movements conform with your constitution and physique.
Ready-made exercises may suit you, or they may be merely
expending your energy, and thus prove harmful.
Judicious exercise is the finest stimulant it’s possible to give
your system. It is Mother Nature’s way of replacing waste
tissue, nourishing the nervous system, building up thews and
sinews, improving the blood, toning up all the important
internal organs. It is the pleasant and correct way of sustain-
ing vim and vigorous health.
Judicious exercise is performing movements exactly suited for
your physique—the system upon which the Baker Postal Course
of Physical Culture is based. Each pupil gets the exercises
he or she most needs.
Each pupil benefits quickly and permanently as a result.
Here is evidence of what my Course is accomplishing every
day:—
“My chest measurement has increased from inches
at start to 37A inches. My legs and arms are much larger.
I have also gained in weight to the extent of several
pounds, and I am altogether delighted with your Course,
if you have any inquiries that seem doubtful of your exer-
cises, iust tell them to write to me, and I will convince
them otherwise.” (Name on request.)
Be a rich-blooded man full of energy, full of health, able to
enjoy life to its utmost. Take your first step healthwards by
writing for fees and details of my instruction. I’ll send you my
interesting 18-page folder.

An even spread of shot with good penetration is
what you need for bird shooting, especially for fast
flyers. It is these qualities that have made Win-
chester “New Rival” cartridges so popular among
bird shooters. The Winchester system of loading
and wadding, which is the result of vast experi-
ence in manufacturing shotgun cartridges, seems
to be rather more successful than others. Besides,
the corrugation around the head of Winchester
cartridges, which is patented, is a great feature.
Winchester “ New Rival” cartridges are made extra
strong to permit reloading and are always satis-
factory. They are sold by all dealers.

fiIVAL”
“Way Verley Penn’’: Hindmarsh (S.A.) identity
Janies Chittleborough, one of the Buffalo consign-
ment of pioneers who reached Glenelg (S.A.) on Dec.
28, 1836, turned 80 the other day. He can remi-
nisce by the hour concerning the Holy City's earliest
playhouses. The first was a wooden structure on
North Terrace, a long hop, step and jump from the
site of the present Adelaide Royal. Next one Lazaar,
the progenitor of Sam and Abraham Lazaar, got a
theatre going in Gilles Arcade, Currie-street, with
which enterprise George Coppin and Harry Lambert
were associated for many years. The place is now a
livery stable. At the same time as the Lazaar show
was running a Mr. Deering ran a little theatre at
the back of the Aerated Bread Co.’s old premises in
Waymouth-street.
“Melb.” : Asche’s Christmas attraction at the Royal
(Melb.) will be “Antony and. Cleopatra.” It is singu-
lar how little this play was acted until almost our
own time. The boy performers of Shakspeare’s day
would hardly be convincing as Cleopatra; and the
succeeding actresses, such as Oldfield, Bracegirdle,
Woffington, Cibber and Pritchard, stood off. They
were not over-particular ladies, mostly, but yet ap-
pear to have been of the opinion, later expressed by
Mrs. Siddons, that it was degrading to act the
Enchantress. How magnificent Mrs. Siddons would
have been in the part! Yet there is no record of her
attempting it. Nor would Miss O’Neill act it, though
she would have shone, too. I cannot find that Mrs.
Warner, Helen Faucit, Ellen Terry, or Fanny Kemble
risked it. The first to make a speciality of it was
Miss Gl.vn, who was short and almost ugly, yet
fixed herself up grandly. Phelps brought out the play
at Sadlers’ Wells; but C. Kean’s ..superb London pro-
ductions did not include it. In later time it has been
a good deal acted by Miss Wallis, Mrs. Potter, and
others. I have a dim idea that Montgomery and Miss
Cleveland gave it in Melbourne. The last production
there was by Miln, for whom Hennings painted
scenery—his last work. Beerbobm Tree gave a sump-
tuous London production—which he repeated in Ber-
lin—and Asche has the props, got together on that
occasion.
“The Glad Eye” has been celebrating its first anni-
versary in London Strand Theatre. It is still winking
hilariously to crowded audiences, and looks like last-
ing for a second year. Et'hel Dane, an Australian,
has made a big hit as the blithesome maiden whose
merry optic produced so much mischief. After the
anniversary performance on Nov. 4 there was a big
congregation on the stage, where Miss Dane cut the
anniversary cake and drank a bead or two of the
wine of gratitude.
Joseph Blasheek, with Mildred Wrighton, is getting
good notice in London as an Australian Humorist. As
former president of the Dagonet Club in Melbourne,
he has got on the right side of George R. Sims, and
that experienced old journalist can make things very
nice with the Press in London for anyone who is
“solid” with him.
In Melbourne a benefit is being arranged for Flora
Graupner, who has been putting up a long, hard fight
against the grimmest sort of illness. The little
woman has earned the help. She made her stage ap-
pearance in the early 80’s as a juvenile Josephine
in “Pinafore.” That was under Mrs. G. B. Lewis.
In 1890 she was Gianetta in the first Australian pro-
duction of “The Gondoliers.” Billy Elton, Howard
Vernon, Maggie Moore and Flo Young figured in the
cast. She played Cicely in the first production of
“Marjorie,” Michaela in “Carmen” (Marie Halton
was the gypsy charmer, Walshe was Jose and Charles
ltyley the toreador), Phyllis in “lolanthe” (Ida
Osborne was in the name part), and “The Old
Guard,” in which the Eltons made their farewell
appearance in 1892.
“Harrison 0.”: One of the things about Shaw
which provokes my admiration is that he does not
have to provide his interiors with doors on all sides.
The average dramatist —Pinero, the much-boomed
craftsman, is a bad offender in this respect—appears
unable to get along unless the boudoir of the affluent
Mrs. Lais, or the garret of the starving heroine, is
studded with doors like a pub corridor. Shaw's in-
terior in the first act of “Man and Superman,” which
has just been produced by the Melbourne Repertory
Theatre, has only one door, yet he manages to get
the eight characters on and off without mishap.
According to the London Daily Chronicle the
tongue-twisting song of the approaching pantomime
season there is to be “Woolloomooloo” —a name
which has been popularised in London halls of late
by Herbert Rule.
From London: The Palace Theatre, which has been
specialising for some time in undraped female, has
nearly had its teeth jerked out of its head by the
bit of the Lord Chamberlain, who has refused a
license to “A Venetian Night”—a new wordless
piece in which a giddy reproduction of Eve before
the Fall was to have been frequent and free. The
play was to have been produced on a Monday, and
was extensively boomed in advance. On the Sunday
night there was a final rehearsal, at which an official
of the Lord Chamberlain’s Department was present.
It was so much of an undress function that the
official fled with the news that the thing was alto-
gether too raw to be licensed. The manager scurried
round and borrowed fill-up turns; but, having spent
£4OOO on the “Venetian” preparations, he is a very
enraged Batt. Yet he has only himself to blame. 1-Ie
had so profitably exploited the large, undraped
female that at length he took her for granted, and
thought he could do what he liked with her. He
started the craze with Maud Allan, a Canadian dam-
sel who wore a handful of beads, and his latest speci-
men was Gaby Deslys, whose going-to-bed scene was
just about the most daring ever-shown in London. A
few steps more, and Batt would have taken the license
of the Palace over the precipice, so the Chamberlain
has done him a good turn really.
“Norbell”: The dramatic “Faust,” which is to be
one of J.C.W.’s Christmas attractions, was last pre-
sented in Sydney in 1895 at Her Majesty’s under
George Rignold’s notable management. It was a
revelation in stage craft, from the uncanny effects
in the prologue to the weird and wonderful steam
curtain just before the apotheosis of Marguerite.
Marie Lohr made her first appearance in that pro-
duction. She was one of the tiny kiddies who
fought for a hot cross bun on the steps of the Nur-
emburg Cathedral at the instigation of Handsome
George Nick. Marie’s talented ma, Kate Bishop,
was in the cast as Martha. George Rignold was
Meph., the brilliant Scott Inglis was the rejuvenated
Faust, and the late Stirling Whyte was old-man
Faust. Cyril Keightley, who is now holding up his
end at Drury Lane and adjacent parts, played Siebel,
and Harry Plimmer was Valentine. Miss Agnes
Knights was Marguerite; and James Hazlitt, Harry
Hodson, D’Orsay Ogden, Frank Harcourt and George
Marlow helped the show along. In fact, there were
quite a lot of clever people in the cast, including
me.
MELBA’S HATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I hate dress.” — Melba, to a London interviewer.
Hate pretty clothes! Excuse us, please,
If -till incredulous we seem.
To womankind such words as these
Are blasphemous in the extreme,
For woman’s hell of blank despair
Is having nothing fit to wear.
With dress forgotten, shops would be
Deserted by the female crew,
And dreary, grey monotony
Would surely brood in Heaven, too.
Is woman’s Eden in the sky
Not dubbed in hymns, “Sweet buy and buy” ?
If true it is, as you confess,
You find those splendid gowns you wear
A fearful trial, a weariness
Of flesh and spirit, why still bear
The pangs? A million sisters pray
You will your burdens heavy lay
Upon their shoulders right away.
VICTORIA.

SEE THE BEST TROTTERS at
VICTORIA PARK., Dec. 28
THE last Trotting Meeting for 1912, to be held at Victoria Park, next Saturday, will prove of
unique interest to country visitors in town for the A.J.C. Meeting. Australia’s finest Trotters
will be seen at work upon the most up-to-date track South of the Eine. The Trotting Track
cost ovei /10,000 to instal, being 1-g- miles in circumference. The Distance Starting, adopted by
the leading Victorian Trotting Clubs, is used at Victoria Park.
Many Country Clubs have already adopted Distance Starting, and, in a short time, this system
will be in vogue throughout N.S.W.
The Victoria Park Grounds are artistically laid out and dotted with flower beds—the whole
presenting a pleasing picture. Commodious Retiring and Sitting Rooms in the Paddock Stand and a
well furnished Dining Room, to seat 500 guests, occupies half the ground floor. De Groen’s Vice-
Regal Band will render selections during the afternoon’s sport.
If you wish to spend a really pleasant afternoon, come to Victoria Park next Saturday.

ANTINEURASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with' a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover

Samuel Sobbs: You don’t explain the
cause of the increased crime in Carterton, but infer
that no-license evils in its neighbor, Masterton, are
to blame. Do the Carterton people pass their open
bars to find methylated spirits and other maddening
dope in Masterton? And how is it, seeing you men-
tion the matter, that the crime (on paper, anyhow)
is decreasing in Masterton, where the sly-and-vile
groggers are in full swing ? Will hold copy till you
make the position a bit clearer. . . .Rex: The Bulle-
tin would blush to mention it, despite the fact that
it appeared in that stalwart pillar of the kirk, the
Otago Daily Times. .. .G.V.W.: Next to dying,

handicap it is for a white man to be born in the
tropics. . .W.S.N.D.: (1) The distance from Yassber-a

“Altair”: “Ivuscobin” (B. 5/12/’l2) re-
lates a thrice-removed story of an “in-
vasion” of Australia in 1813. It is all a
fairy tale. As Ernest Scott (“Terre Napo-
leon”) and other authorities show, Aus-
tralia was much more secure from foreign
aggression at that date than it is at the
present moment. The British navy was
then supreme on all the seas, and the few
French sloops left were mostly looking for
aiding places. There were always one or
two British warships about Sydney, not to
mention the forts on South Head and else-
where, and the few hundred soldiers of the
N. S. Wales corps. The alleged destruction
of the IT whalers is even more incredible
than the contemplated capture of Sydney.
Those old-time whalers were not toothless
craft like the cetaceans they hunted. They
carried guns and letters of marque, and
filled in the off-whale season with a bit
of privateering. Two of them arrived in
Sydney as early as 1799 with a rich, Spanish
prize all the way from Peru, and the other
whalers promptly left in search of a few
more of the valuable fish—which may ex-
plain the scarcity of oil at a later date.
Scott certainly states that Napoleon “or-
dered” the taking of Port Jackson in .1810,
but, for the very sufficient reasons above-
cited, the order was never carried out.
From the Sugar Commission’s report: —
It might safely be said that the opinion generally
held by medical witnesses is that the white man can
lead a healthy life and rear a vigorous family in tro-
pical Australia, provided he adapts himself to his sur-
roundings as regards diet and clothing, and' avoids
alcoholic excesses, which, while injurious in any-cli-
mate, are particularly debilitating in the tropics,
and a fruitful source of sickness amongst the workers
in the sugar industry. In addition to the medical
evidence a large amount of testimony was given by
other witnesses to the effect that the adoption of
white labor had had a beneficial effect generally, and
the virtual unanimity of opinion against any proposed
return to black labor conditions is remarkable. In
this connection it is interesting to observe that one
witness stated as his experience that the lads reared
in tfie district ipade the best farm hands.

They Tell a Graphic Story
Fig. 1 merely illustrates the relation of the iron-frame and the wrest-
plank (that is, the tuning-block) in an ordinary imported piano. The tuning-
pins and wires have been removed.
Fig. 2 is a nearer view of the wrest-plank of the same piano.
Fig 3 is the Beale Patent Piano Frame, removed from the piano, and
the end of the wrest-plank cut off to show the wrest-pin in the solid iron frame.
Fig. 4 is a nearer view of the Beale Patent frame shown in Fig. 3.
Now—
The wrest-plank of an imported piano is a block of wood about sft. Din.
long, and one and a half inches (l|in.) thick, into which no less than two
hundred and sixteen steel spikes are driven. Each spike is about 2£in. long
and |in. in diameter; each one is hammered into a hole previously drilled in
the wrest-plank. The holes are all slightly smaller than the spikes, so that
when the latter are driven home the wood will pinch tightly round them.
Consequently each spike acts like a wedge in the wooden plank, tending to
burst it asunder.
But that is not all.
To each spike a steel music-wire is attached, and the spike is wrested
round with a key, thus coiling up the wire and tightening it. It is to resist
the tendency of the wire to turn the spike (or “wrest-pin”) back again that the
wood must pinch tightly upon the spikes.
When all the wires are at full tension—that is to say, when the piano is
in tune at concert pitch—the total strain upon the two hundred and sixteen
steel spikes is nearly sixty-seven thousand pounds (67,0001 b.) not quite
thirty tons.
No block of wood can withstand such a strain for long, especially in the
trying Austialian climate. Remember that a dual strain is exercised upon it
- theie aie first of all two hundred and sixteen wedges bursting the plank
asunder, and then there is the levering strain of 67,0001 b.
Of couise, the wood must sooner or later give way. The pins become
loose and the piano will no longer remain in tune.
fsd
ALL THIS IS OBVIATED IN THE BEALE PIANO by
our wonderful patent METAL wrest-plank, forming part of
the usual iron frame. (See Fig. 3.)
The pins are merely placed in the holes, not hammered
in. The thirty-ton strain—or even double or treble that
strain—will not have much effect, will it?
And, seeing that the pins are case-hardened steel, working
in smooth, lubricated metal bearings, no amount of turning
will materially loosen them.
In addition to this advantage of permanence in tune
which is attained by our patent steel tuning system, a
GREATLY ENHANCED TONAL QUALITY TS ALSO
OBTAINED.
We cannot illustrate the tone of a piano—you must hear
that for yourself. Call and let us demonstrate their tonal
quality.

It is important for
piano-buyers to note
that these pins can be
adjusted to ANY ten-
sion, tight, medium,
or loose, by means of
the tension screws at
the back. We always
adjust them to resist
the pull-round of the
strings, but at the
same time they are
easily turned by the
tuner without touch-
ing the t e n si o n
scretcs. Our pianos
are tuned in the or-
dinary way, by one
man only, from the
front only. Be sure
to note this, and you
will know what to
think if you are .told
otherwise by unscru-
pulous competitors.

POCKET KODAK
ENTHUSIASTS —!
This is the camera for those who detest carrying anything in the
hands, and have a dislike of everything bulky. It can be carried —as your
watch —in a vest pocket without any inconvenience, and will tell the
story of your holidays and other days better than a notebook. Being
free of projections and complications and entirely self-contained, weigh-
ing only B£oz., you will appreciate what a wonderful example it is of
mechanical ingenuity in the saving of bulk and weight.
The Y.P.K. is always ready for immediate use; can be loaded and
unloaded in daylight; and as the developing and printing of films can
also be carried out in daylight, no darkroom is necessary at all. Alto-
gether a desirable instrument to possess, both for the beginner and the
more advanced worker who wants a handy pocket camera for photo-
graphic note-taking—notes which may subsequently form the basis of
large pictures.
The Vest Pocket Kodak Camera is fitted with a carefully selected
Lens, Kodak Ball-bearing Shutter, Brilliant Reversible Finder and
Auto-time Scale. Loads in daylight with Kodak Film for eight
exposures.

“Billy B.”: I didn’t really know what
dreadful enemies the Peace Societies and
Labor red-raggers were to Australia until I
read the Times (London) the other day.
When the said Peace Societies and red-
raggers urge the freedom of the great White
Commonwealth to the Asiatic they
sureiy know what the morals of the
colored races are, otherwise, I take it,
they would not dare to face argu-
ment. And here are some of the morals of
the inhabitants of India as set out in the
Times :
Among the Hindus, forming two-thirds of the
population, the service of the temples is held to
demand large numbers of girls dedicated in infancy
to religious prostitution.... When in 1891, under the
persevering influence of the late Mr. B. M. Malabari,
the age of consent for married as well as unmarried
girls was raised from 10 to 12 years, there was a
storm of opposition from orthodox Hindus.
Three private Bills were introduced re-
cently in the Viceroy’s Chamber to improve
matters, and Sir Reginald Craddock, while
welcoming the Bills on behalf of the Gov-
ernment, had this to say :
It was proposed to raise the age of consent, the
relation of husband and wife being excepted, from
under 12 to under 13. . . .It will be penal for any per-
son having the custody of a minor to cause or en-
courage her seduction ; and power is to be given, as
in the English law, to take away minor girls from
the custody not only of strangers but of guardians,
even of parents, who are bringing them up to a life
of immorality.
And Craddock was careful to explain that
the British Government “was not actuated
by any desire to assail the religion or to
cast a slur upon the social usages of the
people of this ancient land.” Now, I want
to know what is actuating the Peace So-
cieties and the red-rag mongrel-race advo-
cates and others in battling to foist on this
clean young nation the awful horde that
has, as part of its religious practices, the
violation of tender children. If I don’t re-
ceive a prompt and satisfactory answer, I’ll
be compelled to believe that my horribly-
unpleasant suspicions are correct.
“Milmeridien,” on a Northern scandal: —
There is a cry, in Adelaide particularly, against
the Northern Territory Aborigines Protection Depart-
ment. Yet there is no public department which, by
speaking out, could so easily smash up its detractors.
Why doesn’t the Minister relax the rule of silence
and permit the heads to protect themselves in print?
If he did that, the officers could paralyse these mean
crawlers whose one desire is to withdraw all protec-
tion from the blacks, so that there might be a return
to the old tariff of nothing a day and find themselves.
One Darwin Wowser is up against the Department
because Beckett, the Chief Inspector, refused to sup-
ply him with 20 strong natives to do his tin-sampling
at ss. a week —work which Malays had thrown up
at 7s. a day and white men wouldn’t tackle at 10s. a
day. Another cheap-labor lover is interested in the
despatch of news to Adelaide newspapers, so that
distortions of aborigines protection facts, as of
mining and other facts, plead louder against the
muzzling of the officials. Add to this a leakage of
telegraph messages, which amounts to a censorship,
and there is every inducement to the best-meaning
official to “ca’ canny” as a prelude to returning to
the rotten ways of the old regime. The administra-
tion is tending that way with great rapidity.
“Trotter”: The Australian National Gov-
ernment decides to make a start in the
Northern Territory by offering 26 farms,
averaging about 500 acres. These are re-
cently surveyed lands on the navigable Daly
River, and are recommended by the Land
Classification Board (Ryland, Clarke and
Day). The 26 blocks will be handed over
free to approved persons; but as immense
tracts of good surveyed land are in the
vicinity, it is expected that the balance will
be taken up at a satisfactory rental. When
a start has been made, smaller areas will be
offered for intensive cultivation. The Board
will soon have plans of land now under sur-
vey in the Waterhouse district, close to the
railway, 70 miles from Darwin. The blocks
now offered free are 100 miles from Darwin,
but only accessible by sea and river in about
150 miles. Or it is possible to go by rail
via Brock’s Creek, and thence by road.
By rail it is 104 miles to Brock’s
Creek, and by road 70 miles. Trans-
portation will be provided by Govern-
ment vessel, trading regularly between Dar-
win and the settlement; and the settlers will
also get help from a Government demon-
stration farm near the blocks. The district
has been proved eminently suitable for grow-
ing maize (two crops a year), tobacco,
sugar, cotton, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits,
bananas, etc. The estimated rainfall is the
same as at Darwin, about 60in. Ad-
vances of material will be made to settlers
at cost price, and they will also get the
offer of any Government odd jobs to keep
the pot full. Applications will be received
up to the end of February, and possession
can be had about May. The date when
there will be a local market for the pro-
ducts of the farms isn’t mentioned.
The Sydney importer has been wailing
bitterly again. So much repulsive rotten-
ness is traded off on the Australian public
as “figs in boxes” that Tudor, of the Cus-
toms, issued a regulation to the effect
that, being put into circulation, every
box of this imported fruit should be
labelled “Sound, fresh and clean.” The
importers know that the prime Smyrna
goods are often chiefly maggots ; hence they
howled at Tudor for daring to suggest that
they should give any sort of guarantee with
the food. And the S. M. Herald, which
can’t make up its alleged mind whether to
cry Stinking Fish or be a decent Australian,
got down on the wrong side of the fence
again and declared that the pure food regu-
lation was a mean subterfuge to sneak in
Protection, although “this particular 'fruit
cannot be produced in Australia.” If the
Herald tried for 24 hours it couldn’t tell a
more brazen lie. As a matter of fact, figs
can be grown almost anywhere in the Com-
monwealth, and in S. Aus. they are about
as cheap as thistles —you can get a barrow-
ful of them for a shilling.
“The Oldest”: In connection with the
municipal jubilee of Newtown (N.S.W.),
all the Sydney dailies have raked up the
discredited legend about the semi-historical
Margaret Catchpole being identical with
Mary Reibey. As a matter of fact, the
latter lady- came to Australia eight years
before Margaret Catchpole, namely in 1792,
in the Royal Admiral. She lived in Reibey
House, Newtown, from the early ’4o’s until
her death in 1855, whereas Margaret Catch-
pole died in 1819, according to the entry in
the register kept by Parson Fulton, at Rich-
mond (N.S.W.).

Honor the Christmas Toast in “Thorne’s!”
THORNE’S is the worthy medium of the most honored toast. And there
is about a Christmas toast that touch of Goodwill, Brotherhood and
Tradition which invests it with an importance over most other toasts.
For 80 years Thorne’s has, by its uniform excellence and quality, been chosen
by the man of taste as the fitting accompaniment for the sincerest expression
of esteem.
By its Purity and Quality, by its Inimitable Flavor—the product of skilful
blending and patient ageing—Thorne’s claims and holds the unswerving adherence
of the connoisseur.

IN
BANANA LAND
“Flinderino”: It is pleasing to note that
many of the stopping-places on Bananaland’s
new coastal railway will carry aboriginal
names. Between Rockhampton and Yaamba,
a distance of 22 miles, there will be I'andon
(mountain wallaby), Panpananco (plurry
good-pfella camp or bosker place), and Ka-
wanafwild flowers or some other vegetable).
Another of the stations is to be named Jar-
dine, after John Jardine, the first police
magistrate of Rockhampton, and boss of the
Somerset settlement, formed at the top of
Cape York in 1563-by the British Govern-
ment.
“Politicus”: How is it that when Queens-
land Cabinets are in process of repair and
renewal the claims of James Forsyth,
Philp’s brother-in-law, are so persistently
overlooked in favor of the pretensions of
men not half as able? It looks as though
he may have to wait until Philp comes in
again—a contingency not very far away if
the ex-Premier only cares to give the signal.
But the genial Robert is not anxious to take
on the butcher’s job of retrenchment that
must inevitably follow the present extrava-
gance.
After hunting down the milk sophisticator
for nearly half a dozen years, the Banana-
land Health. Department still contrives to
collect £B4. in fines rom milkmen in one
week. It is high time the more-than-onee-
convicted adulterator was obliged to carry
on his cart a conspicuous sign running this
fashion: —■

BEWARE !
“Platman’s” yarn :—■
When the Brisbane strike was a couple of days old,
Home See. Appel obtained a permit from the Trades
Hall to deliver commodities to a Government chari-
table institution, rather than run the risk of having
the place put on short commons. That caused a row
in the Ministerial room. The two men who most
easily allow political differences to develop into per-
sonal bitterness are Barnes and Macartney, and
neither of them has ever forgiven Appel. The former,
however, has a keener eye to his own advantage, and
has concealed the hatchet, whereas Macartney con-
tinually flourished it. Denham, Grant and
Tolmie did not, like the other two, think that Appel
had committed .the unforgivable sin; besides, they
probably recognised that, as far as popularity was
concerned, Appel was easily the strongest man in the
Cabinet, So Appel remained a Minister and a red
rag, The trouble ended in a burst-up when chief-
policeman’s Cahill’s job came up for review, and it
was. Dreposed to fix him in it for 10 years. Macartney
was Cahill’s chief backer. Appel rebelled. Macart-
ney saw which way the Cabinet cat would jump—•
and get out,
Winton is the prize lucky district of
Queensland. During the last 20 months
£23,000 went into that woolly region from
Tattersall’s. The faith of the West in
Tatt.’s is beautiful to behold.
Captain G. A. Richard, formerly general-
manager of Mount Morgan, just back from
Asia, gives a few facts about wages and
cost of living in Japan:—
Weaver, male, lid. per day; ditto, female, 6jd. ;
tailor, 124 d. ; carpenter, 20d. ; plasterer, 20}d. ;
sawyer, 181 d. ; bricklayer, 24d. ; shipbuilder, 20d. ;
cabinetmaker, 18d. ; blacksmith, 16d. ; silk-spinner
(female), GJd. ; farm laborer, 9jd. ; day laborer.
12d. ; maid servant, ss. ltd. per month. The Mining
Bureau gives the wages of men employed in mining
for metal as 16d. to 81 d. per day. Men employed in
coal mines get 13d. to 2s. 6d. ; timber men, 11 Id.
to 2s. Bd. Female labor is largely employed in
mines, but the women’s wages are much lower than
the rates for men. In collieries miners work nine
hours ; other workers, 11 hours. In Government fac-
tories the minimum working day is 91 hours, the
maximum 12. In private factories (in 1909) the
hours ran: Silk filatures, 13 hours a day: spinning,
12 hours; weaving, 12 hours; matchmaking, 10;
paper-making, 111 hours, each with one hour’s rest.
Cost of living for husband, wife, two children and an
old mother of 60 years(monthly earnings 100 sen, or
605.) would be: Rent, 6s. per month; rice, 165.;
fuel anti oil, 6s. 4d. ; fish and vegetables, 7s. ; sugar,
soy, salt and tea, 3s. 9d. ; liquor and tobacco, 6s.
7d. ; school expenses, 2s. 6d. ; children’s allowance,
2s. sd. ; baths and water rates, 9d. ; hairdresser,
61d. ; clogs, Is. ; newspaper, 6d. ; paper and matches,
sd. ; clothing, ss. 6d.
Incidentally, Captain Richard found that the
Japanese have “a greater tail of indifferent
workers than Europe, America or Aus-
tralia.” It may interest the Australian
woman who buys cheap Jap. draperies to
know that she is patronising factories where
women work 12 and 13 hours a day for a
wage of 6|d. per diem, and it may interest
Andrew Fisher and co. to learn that goods
made under such conditions are daily brought
into Australia to compete with “white” pro-
ducts owing to the Labor Government’s in-
efficient tariff.
STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.
MEDICAL STUDENT: “I say, doctor, I've swallowed some cherry stones. Is it dangerous?
Eve looked through all your book on ‘ Common Ailments,' and can’t find anything
about it.”
PROFESSOR (grimly) : stones? Ah, yes. They will be found in the appendix .”
Mt. Morgan’s patriotic Town Council lias
a curious idea of assisting the great Defence
movement. Recently the Department asked
it for the use of a piece of ground which had
been a goat-run for years. The council said
“Yes”- —for £4O per annum. At the most,
the goat-run is worth £875 outright; and
£4O per annum for 21 years is £B4O. If Mt.
Morgan Council would only value its tax-
payers’ land on the same scale, it wouldn’t
always be stony broke, though some of the
taxpayers might be.

As though he kept the joy we lost
Imprisoned in bis little throat
And loosed in sweet, defiant note
To challenge all the singing host.
And so our ears with music rang
As slow and sorrowful we twain
Went out to bury love !
Your face was hidden ’neatli the frown
Of your too-lieavy hair;
Your shoulders drooped beneath the load,
Your slim feet faltered on the road
We once had found so very fair
To dance and dally down;
And drear, dead leaves of old desire
Were thick—to bury love !
The silence fell....the silence fell.
Ah God ! If You would only speak,
In thunder or in lightning flash,
Some memory-drowning awful crash
To blind the eyes and blanch the cheek,
It might have helped the Hell,
Upon whose edge we stood and smiled
And smiled, to bury love!
And then there came the pulsing kiss
That was the very first we had,
And then the little broken word
Only the dark and star-hush heard,
And all that was so dear and Dad....
And then.... the full completed bliss.
You swayed a little on the edge,
Yet were the first to cast the earth
Across the breast of love!
And all the while the white-throat told
Of trust that has no earthly end,
Of wedding rings and bridal blooms
And baby-cries in darkened rooms.
But when in tones so calm, so cold.
You spoke my name and called me
“friend” —
Ah, then I knew the time had come
To hide the face of love.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 21, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah, —
The squeak of the Christmas trumpet is
about the only thing I have heard since
last I wrote to you. The trams are filled
with small pagan boys who industriously
wipe the jam from their fingers and the dust
from their shoes upon their unhappy neigh-
bors, and at every street corner wor 1 ied
mothers count their broods and split the air
with shrieks of "Bill!” or “Jim!” The sea-
son of alleged peace and goodwill is thus
clearly demonstrated.
Governor Macgregor, with a perspiring
aide, a fully equipped geologist and a cara-
van of some dozen others, clomb to the cool
top of Tambourine Mountain early in the
week. The respite from the atmosphere of
the city was brief, for next day the party
returned. After a night’s rest, his over-
worked Excellency got back to hard graft
in the morning, when he presented, in the
presence of a bunch of femininity, a weighty
purse to Miss Wilkinson, late headmistress
of the Grammar School. The purse was
wrapped up in a bundle of speeches.
The two Qualtrough sisters left on Mon-
day. bound for Sydney. Brisbane' flitters are
many at present, and include nearly all the
male portion of the University staff and their
partners. I must tell you, incidentally, my
dear, that pretty little Miss Ulrich will not
be one of the staff next year.
Bishop Frodsham, bound for England and
the cold'weather that is so trying to the cul-
tivated Australian, passed through Brisbane
this week. Mrs. Frodsham and the kiddies
sailed by the Osterley a fortnight ago, and
so will have more intolerable cold to put up
with than the Bishop. However, they are
younger and can stand it better.
Ex-Minister Macartney lias flown South,
presumably to meet “Bob” Philp and
tell him how dreadfully the party he
used to lead (or mislead) has been
behaving itself. Or it may be, lie wants to
have a word or two with Robert concerning
the Meat Trust, which has started to spend
£300,000 here. Both of them are understood
to be very friendly towards the visitor, and
to be more or less interested in its success.
Which reminds me that the report of an
interview with the ex-Premier has been sent
along from the South. As usual, Mr. Philp
cries for capital, capital, and is much dis-
tressed that Labor legislation is keeping it
away. Perhaps. And perhaps not. The present
rising generation’s father tells of the time
when capital simply rolled in, and, though
there wasn’t any Labor party at the time,
such dreadful things were done with the
money that Queensland’s biggest bank hasn’t
sent out a single dividend notice since, hav-
ing been too busy paying up by slow degrees
the ancient creditor. There’s a lot still to
pay, as Mr. Philp may know, being a bank
director himself; and I’m wondering whether
that fact hasn’t had just a little to do
with John Bull’s and Sandy Mcßull’s pre-
sent shyness.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Home-Secretary Appel is just about to
wipe out the toll on Bundaberg’s Burnetr
bridge, abolishing thereby the only bridge
toll now existing in Australia.
ALDEKMAM
DIDDUMS,
ex-Mayor (and
many other things)
on Brisbane.
Nine of the principal bakeries of Bris-
bane, doing about three-fourths of the trade,
have formed themselves into the Automatic
Bakeries, Ltd. As usual, it is carefully
pointed out that the new concern isn’t a
trust or a combine, but just an amalgama-
tion to prevent overlapping and waste, and
to secure better bread, made with up-to-date
sanitary appliances, at the old rate. So far,
of course, the idea is excellent. But the
thing will need watching. The means to do
ill deeds pretty often make ill deeds done;
and unless the Commonwealth is given the
powers for which the Government is now
asking, Brisbane may yet have to pay 6d.
a loaf for its principal fodder. The means
to stop ill deeds being done pretty often pre-
vent ill deeds being done.
Judge Chubb gave wlmt may prove to be
a momentous decision recently. A certain
John Smith, engineer in the Brisbane
Tramway Co.’s power house, refused
during the late strike to obey the
order to down tools and come out.
For this he was excluded from the
benefits of his union. Smith brought an
action to compel re-instatement. Justice
Chubb held that the Court had no power to do
what he asked, as the Amalgamated Society
of Engineers was acting in restraint of trade
when it joined the strike, and was therefore
an illegal combination. He held that on the
evidence the principal object of the union
was to get control of the member’s right to
work for whom he pleased, and for that and
other reasons the union had lost its legal
status, and could not sue or be sued. If this
extraordinary judgment is maintained as
sound, an industrial union will be about as
potent for fight as a hamstrung mule. It
would, however, be interesting to know what
Chubb would do in such a case as this: Sup-
posing a mining co. illegally bought some
beer (not being authorised by its articles to
buy beer), and supposing it then refused to
pay a solicitor his bill, would his Honor
decide that the solicitor couldn’t recover,
the co. having lost its legal status? And if
a shareholder had had his shares wrongly
forfeited, would his Honor tell him that he
had no redress, the co. being no longer cap-
able of being sued?

SEPARA*
l -TOR
The keen farmer judges by results
Here is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
TheMELOTTE
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies inthefact that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay
for upkeep.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
al "f- No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i nn-
nerve c o in-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to euro you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
reftret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. Wo have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
IQ
cured, and you can be cured, too. You inav wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
v, sit); This includes a pair of drums (they arc only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., hut the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order forrn below, and the Outfit will he sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t deiay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

“About seven years ago, I got eczema and
have had it nearly every winter, off and on,

scratching.
‘ * I read of the Cuticura treat-
ment in the paper, and I
thought I would try the Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. I
sent for some and after I had
washed myself two or three
times and applied the Cuticura Ointment,
they eased the itching. I continued with the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment for about three
months, which I found cleared my skin won-
derfully. I had suffered seven years and had
tried ever so many things all to no advantage,
until I tried the Cuticura Soap and Ointment,
and was entirely cured. They made my skin
soft and beautiful, everything being cleaned
away. My skin is now quite clear, and there
has been no indication of the sores coming
back. I shall be glad for any sufferer from
skin trouble to hear of this, for Cuticura Soap
and Ointment certainly cured me.” (Signed)
Thomas Barry, 10, Reservoir St., Wardley,
Durham, Eng., Jan. 13, 1911.
To go through life tortured and disfigured
by itching, burning, scaly and crusted skin
and scalp humours is unnecessary. For
more than a generation, warm baths with
Cuticura Soap and gentle applications of
Cuticura Ointment have proved successful
in the most distressing cases, of infants,
children and adults, when all else fails.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold through-
out the world. A liberal sample of Cuticura
Ointment, with a 32-page book on the skin

if you would like to see the alteration Grey-
Hairs make, just lay a piece or paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here iet me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Melb.”: A test has been made of the safes in
use in the Commonwealth’s strongrooms, where the
four-million gold reserve is lodged. The scientific
burglar nowadays has a device for generating oxy-
acetylene gas, which, directed in a blower, reduces
the hardest steel to butter. The Australian Gov-
ernment keeps secret its device for baffling the ener-
getic chemist, though this much is known: the outer
casing of the safes is a thick band of steel, with
copper sheets and concrete. Strange to add, the
steel is essentially weaker than the copper and
concrete. The harder the steel, the more vulnerable
to the burglar’s new ally. The Melbourne tests have
been satisfactory, so Fisher sleeps soundly.
. “Kuscobin”: Napierite, mistakenly referred to as
Powerite in recent cables, is an Australian-invented
explosive,, manufactured in two types—No. 1, the
“high explosive” used in shells for bursting on
impact (just as lyddite does), and No. 2 (corres-
ponding to cordite), for firing from the small-arm or
cannon mouth. It is the latter, if it has the
virtues reported of it, that promises to revolutionise
gunfire in modern warfare. At Gov. Chelmsford’s
initiative it was tested for eight months by the
British Admiralty officials connected with the Pacific
Squadron, and was proved by them to have nearly
twice the penetration of the explosive in service use.
And there were other advantages. Cannon from which
most “high explosives” are fired, have to be thor-
oughly cleaned within a few hours of use. If left
for a couple of days, the acids generated in the firing
will corrode the barrels. The Commonwealth authori-
ties proved Napierite generated no acids what-
ever. Add to this that Napierite is smokeless, fume-
less and odorless, and gives a very slight recoil. It
is generally known that the French have a secret
mechanism which enables them to work their quick-
firing guns 25 p.c. faster than any other nation.
Where Napierite is used ordnance experts believe they
will be able to equal this French record, owing to the
slight back-kick. As far as securing any proprietor-
ship or first call on Napierite, the Australian
Government seems to be nowhere. But in a state of war
civil rights would go by the board, and the Defence
authorities- would commandeer -all local supplies, and
no doubt would also insist on continued manufacture
by the Brisbane co. for war requirements, if the
enemy was kind enough not to rush things.

“Larrakeeyah”: The Government refrigerator at
Darwin has given a knock to a Private Enterprise
monopoly. The meat trade of the town has been for
years in the hands of one man, who holds so much
country round Darwin, that he has so far had no
need to fear opposition, and has been able to supply
the community with beef of whatever quality he
likes to sell, at his own price. Even the hotels,
with their monthly bills of £4O and £5O, were
compelled to pay the same price (6d. per lb.) as
the small householder with a daily half-pound o’
steak. * The refrigerator opened a way out. An
hotel proprietor asked for discount on a month’s
bill of nearly £5O, was refused, paid his bill and
ordered a carcase or two from Brisbane, storing it
in the Government cool chamber, and taking out as
required. Others followed suit with such enthusiasm
that Private Enterprise brought down his prices all
round and became unusually and surprisingly polite.
Now, what about that State steam laundry? Is
Thomas going to allow Joe Cook to laugh him off
it? In a country like this, where everyone must
wear washable clothes, or become a public offence at
the end of a week, the laundry business is a serious
item. At present it is in the hands of the Chinese,
who assist their countryman, the Chinese tailor, by
washing the clothes with the help of a stiff bamboo
brush. And has Jocook ever seen a Chinese laundry-
man damping the clothes preparatory to ironing?
Serviettes and pocket handkerchiefs are treated in
the same way. Sing Soon takes a mouthful of water
and gently sprays the table linen and clothes and
handkerchiefs through his unclean dentures. A
glimpse into any one of the dozen alien laundries
in Darwin would make Joseph clamor for a State
laundry. He would feel the “dobi itch” at once.
* * * *
“Tiaki”: Some few years ago The Bulletin
printed an article showing how the reduction of duty
on white lead had closed a white-lead factory near
Sydney, and displaced a number of hands. At that
time white lead was selling at about £4 per ton less
than it was quoted in Maoriland. After the closing
of the Australian works, the article was bumped up
to about £2 10s. more than the M.L. selling price.
The foreigner had first of all killed the Australian
industry by selling at a loss, and then made good
the loss by charging a monopoly price. Some light
is probably thrown on the matter by a notice sent
out by a large firm of English color grinders: “The
lead corroders of Great Britain have formed a com-
bine (or trust, we prefer to call it) regulating the
price of dry white lead to the grinders, and have
compelled us to raise the price of ground white lead
to what we call a ridiculous price.” The sinking
and subsequent rising of white lead prices in Aus-
tralia is thus easy to understand. In M.L. there
are numbers of industries which have died the unpro-
tected death. One, a glass-blowing works, was
boycotted by the big importers, and went the way
of the weak. That mighty industry, the production
of population, is also languishing, and Bull’s vessels
are bolting back and forth across the deep in a- vain
endeavor to keep the supply of imported ‘incum-
brance” up to the demand. In fact, about the only
things which seem to be increasing in M.L. are
mutton, motor-cars, the National debt, strikes and
sly-groggers.
A THEME FOR JUBILATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cemetery, which has been the centre of a great
deal of argument lately over the question of obtain-
ing a park for Newtown (population 29,000), con-
tains about 18,000 bodies. Here lie the victims of
the Dunbar wreck. An old resident, Mr. Sampson,
well remembers their burying. “It was about eight
o’clock in the evening,” he said. “Rev. C. C. Kemp,
the rector, buried them. A full moon was shining,
and it was sad, sad, to see the hearses driving up in
that bright light to the cemetery. —Extract from full-
page daily paper article, re jubilee of a Sydney
suburb.
Observe our dead ! They rest
In straight and decent rows.
(O Corpses doubly blest!
In Newtown you repose!)
The People of the Past,
Here in their earth-cells pent,
Still serve the purpose vast
Of our advertisement.
Though high above each head
The waving grass you see,
We don’t shut out the dead
From our live ju l llee.
There is a reason good ;
Deep in this crowded clay,
In rotting shells of wood,
Old Grief is packed away.
The Dunbar bodies here
Are treasured. One drear night
In moonlight coldly clear
They stowed them out of sight.
The undertaker’s men
Strange hats and whiskers wore;
Their like will not again
Cheer up the Styx’s shore.
Some Eighteen Thousand dead
This splendid graveyard line;
Outside the living tread —
(In thousands) Twenty-nine.
Don’t live and die afar!
In Deadtown you still leaven
The festivals ! We are
(In thousands) Forty-seven!

CONSTIPATION CONQUERED.
There lies the vital secret where so many diseases and ailments are
concerned — Constipation must be conquered, or normal organic action,
freedom from liver and kidney troubles, and from stomach and bowel
disorders, is not possible.
Cockle’s Pills conquer Constipation of the most stubbornly aggressive
kind; because they strengthen and stimulate and revivify the organs,
which they cleanse and regulate with such consummate ease and efficiency.
The whole system is freed from the wholesale disturbance due to the con-
stipated tendency, from blood impurities, from effete matter, from lurking
disease. Yet Cockle’s Pills act so gently and pleasingly that the most
delicate persons like them.

FEASTING
Biliousness 8 Sick Headaches.
DURING the festive season the good fare often tempts
one to excessive eating, which results in a sharp
bilious attack, sick headache or indigestion.
Because Bile Beans act directly by aiding digestion
and regulating the flow of bile from the liver, they are the
ideal and indispensable medicine for this season. Bile
Beans, being of purely vegetable origin, do not gripe or
weaken like fifty-year-old-mineral pills, but bring to the
stomach and liver just that natural assistance which is
necessary for the restoration of good health and appetite.
Mr. SAMUEL HILL, of Grey Street, South Brisbane,
says :
"My stomach was in such a bad way that I could not
keep a particle of food down, and I lost nearly 281 b. in weight.
When I used to try to take anything in the way of food I would
vomit and retch something frightfully. I also had severe aching-
pains between my shoulders and over ifly hips.
“I was compelled to give up all idea of work, and but for
Bile Beans I believe I should not have been here now. An
acquaintance who had benefited from this great remedy was
so convinced that they would do me good that 1 was induced to
try them. I underwent a steady course of one box of Bile
Beans, and now I can eat and enjoy my food, the sickness and
pain has left me, and my strenyth is regained. I am never
without Bile Beans now, as they always keep me in good health,
and I strongly recommend anyone suffering as I did to try
tlmm.”
The STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE
Bile Beans are un-
rivalled as a family
medicine. They are
mild in action, and
suitable for young and
old of both sexes. Bile
Beans are specially
valuable for liver
trouble, constipation,
biliousness, indiges-
tion, headache, bad
breath, debility, sick-
ness, loss of energy
and bad blood. Sold

A Bush-Bard Sonneteers His
Girl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She may not he treated classically
OH ! could I sit in calm appraisement
here,
A minstrel of true academic mien,
And sing the beauty of my bushland
queen,
Full many a symbol of the sonneteer
Would tell how like a rose she does appear ;
Full many show how clearly can be seen
The hazel glamor of her laughing een,
The dainty beauty of each shell-like ear.
Then would you hear her voice, the night-
, ingale, , . ,
And see her blushes in the early dawn.
Her gold hair as the sun makes haste to
rise; .
And, maybe, from the academic tale,
As jewels from old caskets, could be
drawn
A picture such as virtuosi prize.
But as a sweet hush-woman.
Blit classic thought and classic, simile,
The image elegant of Attic time,
The rounded beauty of the perfect rhyme
Such as our critics crave are not for me;
And even if they were I know that she,.
Fair daughter of a still unfettered clime,
Would take bush-freedom with the verse
sublime,
And ridicule the ancient imag’ry.
So, in the open spaces of the South,
For one great passion of the bush I bring
Rough words that may not be misunder-
stood,
And for herself no homage of the mouth,
But love that sees her throned in every-
thing— , ,
Austral in all except her womanhood.
She is lihe a creek-side.
She is so like a creek-side in the spring,.
Her voice the song of the harmonious
thrush,
That there is hope of seeing wild bees,
crush , .
Into her golden hair on eager wing.
Thinking the wattles are reblossoming;
Or of the fern-fays, with cool waters
flush,
Taking her presence for the noonday hush.
Pulling stray strands to make the heath-
bells ring.
She has the grace of August hickories;
The brown of fern-boles slumbers in her
e-yes;
And ;her breath comes and goes boronia
sweet
From lips like blooms of poinciana trees.
Oh, she is rarer than our edelweis,
Yet homely as a field of ripening wheat.
And a harbinger of Spring.
Her footstep is as musical as waterfalls,
And light as hakea seed winged to defer
To the warm breeze which acts inter-
preter
When Autumn to the scented Summer calls.
Yea ! and her native beauty so enthralls.
The bush-larks and the bluecaps look at
her
As if she were the Spring-time’s har-
binger.
And straightway sing their mating madri-
gals.
The lissomness of white gums is her own,
And she moves softly as the wild flowers
climb
Through velvet grasses up the mountain
height,
Her presence fragrant as a rose full-blown.
And sweet as southwinds in the summer-
time
When earth lies aching ’neath the hot-
browed night.
And all-provocative of Love.
Yet. O Faireen! I looked but in your
And love came to me like the driven fire
When the wild north-wind with consum-
ing ire
Swept from the rocky ranges to the rise
W'mre cornfields ripened for the sacrifice :
Nor did the flames of passion there ex-
pire.
But, forest-deep, against the night’s attir-'
Built blazing beacons that have scorched
the skies.
My being is that forest; night and day
r i' l he burning eucalypts are fiercely fed
With fragrant juices that should keep
them green;
But. though all hope in incense waste awav,
My heart is hot for fiercer flames to
spread
If you but burn with me, Faireen, Fair-
een !

Elder Man’s Lane
I.—JOHNSON’S JAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITHIN a sling-shot of The Bul-
letin office, in a northerly direc-
tion, lies a waterside alley which
I call Elder Man’s Lane, because the one
flagged footpath is so narrow that it is im-
possible for two ordinary men to pass each
other on it, though two “slabs” might sidle
past face to face (they might do it back to
hack, but that wouldn’t be polite), and it
seems the unwritten law of the lane that
the younger wanderer therein should step
off into the dust or mud and give way to the
seemingly older one. The lane is unmade,
as yet, and can be muddy or dusty when it
likes.
The lane runs from George-street North
to nowhere in particular. You can climb
out of it by a green hill if you think you’re
wanted at the other end (there’s an old
pub on top of that hill, and many ways of
escape) ; but if you stick to it, it will lead
you to a dingy North Shore horse ferry, and
so may be said to lead jto all the Northern
suburbs. For the matter of that, it might
even be said to lead to Europe, Asia, Africa
and America, and a good many of the South
Sea Islands ; for there’s a short side-branch,
or bottomless pocket, a step down to the
wharves where the: principal liners lie. A
good deal, of our raw material goes out ot
the “country that way, so “bottomless
pocket” fits the case. The Lane itself is
boomerang-shaped, so you can’t see what s
at the end of it till you get there. It s like
Middle Age Lane in this respect. I know
of no other lane less frequented by ordinary
folk, or the aristocracy, or the demi-monde;
but the dead pass through it often. Also,
the deadbeat, and those who wish they were
dead —or drunk.
Occasionally, about nine o’clock on a hne
morning, you’ll see a fairly well-dressed and
apparently respectable citizen and business
man coming over on the horse ferry, 01 pei
haps he has left. the ferry and got into
Elder Man’s Lane. On the ferry lie holds
himself aloof, paces up and down slowly,
even nervously, or resolutely surveys the
beautiful harbor with his back to the world
and all its paltrinesses ; yet he seems to have
a definite immediate object in view. And
you may be almost sure (1) that that man
has been in very recent trouble, extending
over breakfast this morning; (2) that he
has eaten little or no breakfast; and (o)
that the definite object is to get a good
whisky and soda just as soon as lie reaches
a bar he. knows. I’ll tell you .how it was.
There’s my friend Johnson —or, rather,
there was. Better put it all in the past
tense. Johnson lived on the Shore, and, was
employed in a Government office where he
was indispensable. Say, draughtsman or
something. He was exceedingly clever in
his profession, and so, of course, lie drank
too much. When his “week” came to him
—generally at the end of the month—he’d
leave the office with his screw, and have a
few drinks with the fellows at the Exchange
or Empire; then, as repeatedly instructed
right out to, the gate that morning, he’d
conscientiously take a tram back and
down to Anthony Hordern’s, with a finger
and thumb constantly and anxiously feeling
a half-sheet of cheap, closely-folded note-
paper in his upper left-hand waistcoat
pocket—a scrap of paper lie had been con-
stantly losing, and hunting for, and finding
again all day, and which contained some-
thing as follows, written in a feminine hand
that was characteristic :
1 yard Black Satin for Piping.
J yard Fancy Cream Lace for Yoke.
2 doz. Black Satin Buttons.
1 yard cream gipuirieging (it looks like that).
2 reels of silk to match material.
2 doz. Pat. Fasteners.
2 cards hooks and eyes.
1 set collar supports.
Be sure you go to Hordern’s, and don’t forget what
I told you. And don’t lose this.
Then Johnson would have another drink
to clear his brain and brace him up; and
then a hurried, blurred recollection of
carved lifts, and vistas of varnish and
everything a woman knows, and lovely,
graceful, saint-like shop girls (or sales
ladies), and a smiling, sympathetic shop-
walker taken into his (Johnson’s) confi-
dence, and asked if he was a married man.
and informed in return that he (Johnson)
was a married man, too, and shaken hands
with, with the exaggerated warmth of
affected sympathy—and shown that list.
Then various stairs and different depart-
ments. The shop-walkers and salesmen on
different floors and behind different counters
would stick to Johnson like a brother and
see him through. Perhaps they were mostly
married men, too. Then, after a friendly
and jocular (on Johnson’s part) interval,
he’d be conducted gently to the right lift
and bowed in, after the last shop-walker
had smilingly declined an invitation to
come out and have a drink. And Johnson
would find himself on the level again, with
his bag half full of very soft and perishable
feminine rubbish in brown tissue paper par-
cels —and in urgent need of another whisky.
Then Johnson would charge two Circular
Quay trams, catch a third, and cling to it
tooth and nail, possibly with an instinctive
idea of putting as much of the jumbled city
behind him as he could in the shortest pos-
sible time, and regaining the beloved vicinity
of Circular Quay, where he would feel safe.
He’d drop off short of the Quay, have an-
other drink, and then go into Jack Sotero’s.
the Greek hairdresser’s, to have a shave and
a shampoo, maybe, to freshen him up.
and to collect his thoughts. (It’s all right!
We’ll get back to the horse ferry and Elder
Man’s Lane soon enough.) And he’d get
talking with Sotero about the Eastern
Question, and maybe argue, and they’d
both get excited. Sotero would, sure.
Then Johnson, partly sober, would retire
to a private place and take stock of his
finances. He’d abstract a few more shil-
lings, for current expenses, from that por-
tion of his monthly “screw” set apart earlier
in the afternoon for the use of his wife,
wrap the remainder up tight in another
half-sheet of newspaper, and button it up
in his hip pocket. Then he’d make for the
Quay, and get another drink and more in-
spiration on the way. After which the
world would begin to move.
Fate would have one (or, more likely,
two; they mostly go by twos) of Johnson’s
deplorable acquaintances loitering on the
footnath, opposite the Quay; and Johnson
would stumble into their arms: and they’d
go into one of the first-and-last hotels to
see if they could keep another down. And,
as likely as not, they’d find others of the
Johnsonian school there.
The vicinity would remind Johnson of fi«h
and another thing; so they’d adjourn, and
maybe there’d be stewed oysters and John-
son would make one or two purchases on his
own account. But the fat, futile, vacuously
smiling, oily faces of degenerate Italy would
exasperate Johnson b.v-and-bye, and the
trouble in Southern Europe would come to
the surface again, and Johnson would hold
forth to the edification of the cropped and
grinning Dagoes. He’d be all Turk now (he
was always for the weaker side, was John-
son). But his friends would steer him out
before Tripoli had a chance of being avenged.
Then they’d adjourn to keep another one
down, and Johnson would buy a “parrot”
(i.c„ flask of whisky for the morning), with

Do YOU get Pains in the Loins and Back?
Gravel? Dropsical Swellings? Rheumatism?
Kidney and Bladder Trouble is Serious!
Backache is generally misunderstood. Many people
neglect it because they believe it to be muscular weakness due
to overwork. So they wait for it to pass off.
But when backache does not pass off, we know that the
pain comes not from the back, but from the kidneys, which lie
beneath the back.
It is a warning, and it is a serious warning, for when the
kidneys are weak the uric acid poison they leave in the blood
begins to spread all over the system —
Makes your back ache, your limbs ache —settles into
urinary , sediment or gravel, which irritates the bladder and
keeps it in a constant state of discomfort —clogs the urinary
channels and stops the free passage of water, causing the
swellings of dropsy —forms into sharp, jagged crystals in the
muscles, joints and nerves, as in rheumatism and sciatica.
If you have any of these symptoms, begin with Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills without delay, for the longer kidney
troubleds neglected the harder it is to cure. Doan’s Backache
Kidney, Pills gently lead the kidneys back to health and
activity. They relieve the urinary system like laxative medi-
cines relieve the bowels. They prevent waste water from stay-
ing too long in the body, and they drive out the uric acid
poison which causes the above symptoms and many more.
Two Lasting Cures.
FROM ST. PETERS.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St. Peters, Sydney, says:—
“For ouite a long time I have suffered from pain in my back. I got
little rest at night, and would toss and turn for hours. Consequently,
in the morning I felt tired and weary. I began using Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and two bottles made a difference in my health, and a
\ course of the remedy completely banished the pain. They have proved
§ a marvellous medicine, for it is eighteen months since they cured me,
a nd I have never suffered with my back since.”
1 Three years later, Mrs. Adams confirms the above, and says:—
V< “My husband’s cure has proved permanent. He has had no return of
" • backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him, nearly five
TJ years ago.” \
FROM BOTANY,
T? 1 Mr. Lewis Williams, Elliott’s Terrace, Lower Botany, says :—“I
W as a great sufferer with my back; the pain was at times so bad that I
have had to leave my work and go home. I also had to walk about in
I a bent position, because the pain increased when I tried to straighten
up. I used various preparations, but only got slight temporary relief.
Reading of the cures effected by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, I de-
cided to try them. One bottle eased the pain, and the second completed
my cure. I am quite free of backache now, and can do my work with-
out suffering. My cure did not happen yesterday, but about seven
years ago, and I have been well all that time, so it is not mere tem-
porary relief, but a perfect cure.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Store-
keepers at 2/9 per bottle (six bottles 15/3) ; or posted on receipt of
price by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
DOAN’S
BacKache
Kidney
PILLS
the fixed Intention of going right across and
straight home now. Ilis friends would see
him to the turnstiles, and he’d go through,
informing an unresponsive public, in a loud
voice and with curious inconsistency (con-
sidering the fish shop), that Her Naid grace
had brought him home, To the grandeur
which Was Greece, And the glory which was
Rome. He had the choice of two ferry
boats —Milson’s Point and Lavender Bay—
atid he was known eoually well on either;
but his Fate would put him on the most
crowded one of the evening. and the one with
the greatest number of his acquaintances,
friends, enemies, neighbors and those who
knew him by sight. And, of course, he’d
make a prize ass of himself. He’d surpass
all previous efforts. _ He’d hold forth on
politics, and he’d sing and recite revolu-
tionary verses. He’d be “Wae’s me for
Prince Chairlie” till his friends were heart-
broken, and he’d bellow while his enemies ap-
plauded. He was pro-Russ, pro-Boer, pro-
Australia, pro-liusband, pro-man, pro-beer—
all Pro at this stage : and he’d arise on the
upper deck and denounce the Antis with in-
dignation and enthusiasm that brought him
to the verge of tears. And he’d continue on
the tram, only interrupted when he refused
to pay a degenerate Government a fare, and
one of his friends, the tram guards, took his
name and address for appearances’ sake.
They used to have their books full of John-
son’s name and-address. He wrote it him-
self sometimes.
At the last pub on the Height®, near his
home, Johnson would pull himself together
a bit and seek a private parlor (or still more
private place) and once more review his
finances. (Elder Man’s Lane is very near
now.) He’d carefully distribute threepences
and sixpences through his pocket for his wife
to find when he’d be asleep. Then, if short,
he’d borrow another half-crown or ss. from
her share, to finish up the night with, and
have something in hand for the morning;
then he’d carefully wrap up the share again
and button it down in his hip pocket; then
he’d put one half-crown in one of the other
pockets, take off his boot, put the other half-
crown in his sock under the instep, put on
his boot again, and seek the bar. Where, as
likely as not. he’d meet yet another of the
Johnsonian Brotherhood and they’d finish
the night. Unless his Fate led him home
through the main street, singing.-just as the
majority of his fellow-suburbanites were
pouring out of the picture shows and down
to the tram line. Anyway, he’d go his way,
singing in the. moonlight, with two bottles on
top. of his wife’s forgotten vanities (all is
vanity), and he’d arrive at his own gate,
still singing and still flourishing the Crayfish
of Confidence or the Lobster of Faith.
(Those vain peace offerings!)
He knew, or thought he knew, his wife’s
tastes on all occasions. He’d tell her to nut
her hand in his coat Pocket, and see what
she’d find, and as like as not she’d find
nothing there but dampness. Also, as like
as not, she’d find It afterwards, under the
bottles, and on top of her precious dress
trimmings—a squashed and busted newspaper
parcel of very damp and stringy prawns. But
he’s utterly hopeless, now, lying on his back
on the bed, and singing, or rather roaring, at
the top of his voice, that He’ll vote for Andy
Fisher, No matter what he said! So she
undresses him hastily, gives him a stiff nip.
and puts him under cover. And silence
reigneth.
* * * *
Now you’ve already forgotten the fairly
well dressed and apparently respectable citi-
zen and man of business (or professional
man, or artist) seen occasionally on the
horse ferry, or in Elder Man’s Lane, on a
fine morning about nine. I said I’d tell you
how it was. It was Johnson, the Morning
After the Night Before. Clean-shirted,
clean-collared and clean-socked ; also cleaned
out and tray-bitless. Remember the Sock of
Precaution? The “half-caser” was in her
stocking now, along with the rest.
His wife knew Johnson’s ways. He
would humbly accept the copper "that she
spared (at great personal inconvenience, ac-
cording to herself) from that voracious little
instrument of unblushing capitalism (though
it is painted red) and demoraliser of good
housewives, the accursed gas meter.
Johnson had a season ticket on the passen-
ger ferry; but he’d be far too shaky and
ashamed to face it, so he’d slip unobtrusively
down by-streets and lanes, and along Blue’s
Point-road, and into the horse ferry. Then
he’d get a couple of good whiskeys in the
Bar that Knew Him, and feel his manhood
returning and go to work.
He’d slip out and have another'during the
forenoon and one or two during lunch hour,
and maybe one in mid-afternoon, to keep his
deft right hand steady. Then, be-
tween four and five, several with bachelor
mates or unprincipled husbands who
still held a fair share of their salaries.
The previous night would then be re-
peated, but on a grander scale and with
trimmings. Johnson, with no shopping or
shampooing to cut into his time, would make
a more glorious ass of himself than ever. A
patriot, an orator, a fine singer and reciter,
and the only possible saviour of his country;
and with loftier contempt for the alleged
spirit of Sydney (and more especially that
of North Sydney), he’d time himself to
catch the most crowded ferry boat across.
Sometimes he’d insist on taking a stray
mongrel home with him, in premeditated de-
fiance of Company and Government, even if
he bad to fight for it all the way. And rather
earlier that night he’d be steered lovingly
to his own cate by one or more of the
brethren. And they’d utter words of cau-
tion in whispers that could be heard at the
end of the street, and part with affection
and difficulty. Then Johnson would pull him-
self together, creep in, shut the gate softly,
and go down on his knees and hide two
half-crowns in the dirt under a geranium
bush, fixing the spot in his memory as only
a drunk can, while his careful little wife
watched him thoughtfully from the front
room window.
Then, next morning, the Blast of Repent-
ance on awakening, the horse ferry and Elder
Man’s Lane. And so the thing would be re-
peated to the end of Johnson’s Jag, with
perhaps an interval of a day or two at home
to recuperate. It was bad judgment; for,
whereas, the people of North Sydney might
have seen him sober once a day during his
week or fortnight, they never did. lie
should have gone home by the horse ferry—
But, there! What’s the use of arguing with
a drunk? They don’t see things-as you do.
HERY LAWSON.
The Barman’s Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DIRTY DICK’S place,” said the
handsome barman, “was really a
cellar —or a series of cellars. It
was spotlessly clean for the first few years ;
and he made his reputation—his nickname
came afterwards —by selling the best wines
and spirits to be found in London. Every-
body of any account has been, at one time
or another, a patron of Dirty Dick. Royalty
has taken a drink and smoked a cigar in his
cellar. If he had been the kind of man who
cared for such things he might have owned
the best, or, at any rate, the most charac-
teristic autograph album in Europe. He
had a curious fad which every customer re-
spected. You might take a friend in with
you and have what you requii-ed. But if
your friend asked you to have Another with
him he would meet with a polite refusal.
Dick was an artist and a connoisseur, and
he seemed to think that anybody who had
taken a drink in his cellar should go forth
and turn the drink over upon his palate,
and meditate upon it, and thank God that
there was still such good liquor to be had in
the world, instead of swilling it down and
calling.for more as though it had been com-
mon beer. But you could go out by the
front way and come in by the back almost
as often as you chose. He did a great trade.
And if you had not been at Dirty Dick’s you
had not seen London.
“Well, he made up his mind to get mar-
ried. They said she was a very pretty
woman. Anyhow, he fitted up a suite of
rooms for her in a most elegant fashion. He
owned the whole building, although he con- I
ducted his business in the cellars. She was ,
killed in a collision on the way back from
the church on her wedding day. The famous j
inn was shut up for two days. Then Dick
opened it again, but the rooms he had fitted
up for her wei*e kept locked up. Nobody ■
ever entered them. They were the habita- |
tions of spiders. Gradually the spiders
made their way into the cellars and spun
their webs all over the place. Dick would
not permit them to be touched. They were
sacred. If a spider dropped into your glass i
he would fill up another for you, and care- j
fully rescue the spider. All of his customers
humored his fancy, and his trade became
greater than ever. I’ve seen members of
Parliament and prominent merchants with
tall silk hats duck their heads as they came
inside the door for fear they should break
or disturb the sacred spider-web curtain
that hung across it. And that was how he
came to be called Dirty Dick.
“I don’t know what was the end of him.
I had an engagement in Hamburg for six
months, and when I returned to London
Dirty Dick and Dirty Dick’s sacred cob-
webs and Dirty Dick’s house had vanished.
In its place was a fine new spick and span
hotel called ‘Dirty Dick’s.’ But the custom
had vanished also —run away like water out
of a sieve. It’s always the way,” said the
barman philosophically, “when a publican,
or a grocer, or a draper, or any other kind of
tradesman makes a big name in a small house
—an or’nery-looking old house 'with the
street creeping to its knees —he thinks that it
is up to him to keep pace with the times. So
he pulls down the good old house that
brought him his money and builds a fine
large new one of red brick with white tuck-
pointings and (if he happen to be a publi-
can) with a beautiful new bar, garish with
mirrors, and with never a room or a chair
or a bench in it that an old customer can
feel comfortable in. His troubles about old
customers. Their troubles about him. They
go somewhere else to some other com-
fortable old place where they can sit down
and diank and smoke and yarn without
of their old coats spoiling the new varnish
on the new dadoes or the new counters. I’m
talking about hotels now, because I know
about hotels, but I’ve heard that the rule
applies in other lines of business. What do
you think?”
* * * *
I was quite sure about the matter. There
was, some four or five years ago, a grocer’s
shop in a Sydney suburb. Tlie shop was
old and uncomely, perhaps, but solid-looking.
It had small, old-fashioned windows, which
were so crammed with hams and cheeses, all
of the best, that when you went into the
shop you found yourself in a rich, spicy twi- j
light out of which emerged a stout man in
snowy shirt-sleeves who would ask you in a
rich pleasant voice what he could do for you. j
The man who owned the shop made a for-
tune in it, and his views expanded. He
pulled the old building down gradually and
built a new one on the same site. Brass
rails and rosewood counters and plate glass
windows, through which you could see to the
very furthest end of the Academy of Gro-
cery. No mystery, no suggestion of rich
possibilities in the shape of Arabian Nights’
bargains. Everything plainly ticketed with
its price. The hams —or some other hams—
were still there, but they hung up high on
bright steel hooks, suspended from bright
steel chains, attached to bright steel rods
that crossed the Wholesale and Retail
Lyceum just under its bright blue-steel ceil-
ing. The men behind the counter were also
different in their ways from the assistants
in the good old beetle-browed unpretentious
building. They looked worried and almost
wolfish, and the proprietor, who used to have
a voice like old Burgundy poured from a
cob webbed bottle into a Mura no tumbler,
spoke in rasping tones, and had an anxious
Amei-ican hustling air about him that told
the whole story without a word being said.
The brass-railed, rosewood-countered, plate-
glassed window emporium had turned out a
failure. The old customers patronised it no
xnore, except to the extent of sending their
little girls or boys for bars of soar), or knobs
of blue, or tins of sardines. The grocer's
mana had gone with the house that had •
gone. I knew him very well, and he seemed
nleased to see me again when I spoke to him.
lie put his hat and coat on and we went;
across the road to the hotel.
“By God,” he said over his whisky, and :
shaking his fist at his emporium, “if 1 could
onlv pull that red-brick Jonah down and
build up the old house again what a happy
man I would be !”
If pojlljj ojnlj reconstruct our lives!

1 — It uses chehp lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into .the cylinder, thus dispensing wit» unre
liable and inefficient vaporisers.
3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism; -
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may
be coupled direct.
5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all
the attention necessary.

TAKE THE DRILL
TO THE JOB.
There’s no lost time with a U.S. Electric Drill. The job stays where it
is, and you take the drill to it.
The holes are cut cleaner, faster, and with infinitely less labor than by
hand power. Any electric light connection furnishes the current, as
we can supply windings for all voltages.
It’s the same with the U.S. Electric Grinders. As time savers they are
worthy of your consideration. The superiority of their work makes it
to your interest to install them. There are patterns for internal,
external grinding, and all other purposes for which a grinder is!
essential.
