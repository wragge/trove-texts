SOME RECENT BOOKS.
“The Jewel of Ynys Galon,” by Owen Rhos-
comyl (paper, 2s lOd; cloth, 4s), is a piratical
romance in the familiar “ Treasure Island ” vein.
It is an uncommonly good specimen of its class ;
the interest is strong, there is genuine “go” in
the fights, and the blood and brains are artistically
spattered.
“The Honour of Savclli,’ by S. Levett Yeats
(paper. 3s ; cloth, 4s), is a passable romance in the
style of Weyman, with more tedious detail and
less vigour and fascination. The author explains,
however, that when his book was written he had
not read Weyman—which shows that unconscious
imitation is less to be relied on than conscious.
“South Sea Bubbles,” that charming book of
island travel-sketches, “ by the Earl (Pembroke)
and the Doctor ” (George Kingsley), appears in a
cheap edition (cloth, 3s) while the news of the
titled co-author’s death is yet fresh. Its atmo-
sphere is anything but that of mourning. There
is no art in the descriptions—not even the art of
studied simplicity ; but the pictures of South Sea
life are fresh, vivid, and unaffected, and the book
has a breezy, open-air fascination worth any
number of charms stewed over midnight tapers.
Cole’s “ Chairman’s Guide ” (Is 3d) and “ Ball-
Room Guide” (Is) are * ell-written little manuals.
“ Euancond.it,” by Henry Goldsmith (Goo.
Robertson and Co.) is “an Australian romance”
built on lines w hich are understood to be much
favored in England, but which custom has stated
for the unromantie Australians themselves. The
story occupies itself with the typical remittance-
man who rises through hu-dcs to a fortune which
enables him to marry the typical Australian girl—
who allows the remittance-man to add<ess her by
her Christian name the second time she sees him.
Plot and treatment are essentially commonplace,
but the author manages to get interest enough to
satisfy a not too critical reader. Cloth, 4s.
To lovers of George Eliot, the new cheap
edition of her works can be recommended. Bind-
ing and type are good ; and the price (3s) is
moderate. “ Adam Bede ” is the first volume
(now ob ainable), and will be followed by others
in due course.
A selection of Heine’s “ Letters,” with some of
his best criticisms on art and music, appears in the
r>cott Library (cloth. Is 10d) uniform with the
same author’s “ Italian Travel Sketches.”
“ The Root of the Platter,” by H. H. Champion
(paper, Is 3d), is a scries of dialogues on social ques-
tions which really touch little more than the
fringe of the matter. ..The author defines nothing,
takes his premisses mostly for granted, and arrays
many interesting facts and arguments on unproven
postulates. It is true that what he - takes for
granted is generally a matter of common economic
knowledge ; and that if he had begun at the
beginning he would never have reached his end in
160 pages ; so complaint lies mainly against his
title. The pamphlet seems originally designed for
English readers, and the dialogue “business” is
irritating, but there are many true statements
and forcible phrases, and the whole is worth read-
ing. Mr. Champion’s Socialism is apparently
the variety known as State Socialism, and can
certainly not be denounced as either foolish or
impracticable.
“The Female Offender,” by Lombroso and
Ferrero (Cloth, 6s 9d), is published by Unwin
as the first of a much-needed “Criminology
Series.” The book (a translation, of course) is
companion to Lombroso’S study of “The (male)
Criminal” Englished in the Contemporary Science
series. The female offender is more monotonous
and less interesting than the male, but her peculi-
arities are none the less worth study. Conclu-
sions, in her case, however, are still uncertain;
the authors have had to make their brick with a
quite insufficient quantity of inductive straw.

Handy Language Books.
As a language is alive it is as .difficult
to bag as a cat: it slips through pen
and tongue as quicksilver slips through
your fingers. Yet, though no writer or
speaker can hope to be absolutely correct,
it is plain to everyone with eyes and ears
that some are more correct than qthers.
Within the last few years a tribe of little
handy-books has sprung up to point the
way to linguistic precision, and some of
them will repay purchase and study.
“How to Talk Correctly” (Bd.) quotes a
large number of common errors in speak-
ing and writing, and supplies corrections.
“Don’t,” a similar manual (Bd.), carries
censorship into the domain of manners,
and gives a large number of hints which it
is pleasant to approve without heeding.
“Just the Word Wanted” (Is. 2d.) is a
simple book of synonyms, easily come-at-
able.
“The Handy Guide to Correct Pronuncia-
tion ” (Is. 2d.) list ) words commonly mis-
pronounced, and supplies the proper
pronunciation.
“The Secretary’s Assistant ” (Is. 2d.) teaches
how to address letters correctly to C.M.G.’s
and others of touchy dignity and indignity.
“The Dictionary of Blunders” (Is. sets
one right upon common errors of epithet
and phrase.
“ Familiar English Quotations ” (Is 2d) is a
vest-pocket book useful as far as it goes,
but going hardly far enough. ,
“Everybody's Writing-Desk Book” (Is 3d)
is cordially recommended as the best of
the lot, covering nearly as much ground
as all the preceding together.
“Common Words Commonly Mispronouced”
(2s 4d) goes into the finer shades of pro-
nunciation, and appeals to professional
speakers rather than to the ordinary ama-
teur variety.

hibiting a side of the author’s genius no
shown in the “Short Stories ” elsewher
listed.
A Saint, and other tales, by Paul Bourget
The “other tales” are “A Gambler,
“Two Little Boys,” and “Childhood
Perfidy’—all characteristic of the author’
limpid method.
The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, by Anatole
France.
Dame Care, by Hermann Sudermann.
The House by the Medlar-Tree, by Giovann
Verga.
Gallegher, and other stories, by Richard
Harding Davis.
Balaam and his Master, and other sketches
and stories, by Joel Chandler Harris.
*** With the doubtful exception of “The
Odd Number,” the stories in this series
are rather recommended by style anc
sympathy than by plot or vivid'interest,
Davis and Harris have considerable Ameri-
can vogue, justified by their drollery and
perception ; but the average reader finds
them tending to dullness. ' Yerga, Suder-
mann, and Anatole France employ the
charm of simplicity, not the fascination of
strength and splendour. Bourget’s stories
are lilies, not roses of literature—unless it
be white moss-roses. De Maupassant’s
striking book can be recommended for
general purchase : the others require some
“ acquired taste,” some welcome of appre-
ciative culture. Paper, 3s. each.
The Minerva Library.
The books are among the best and cheapest
published. They are all well printed ; many
of them illustrated ; and the cloth binding is

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and jt never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
obtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Bverton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it. —Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwiok.”
Prepared only, and sold wholesale and retail, by
the proprietor, W. G. Hearne, chemist, Geelong.
To be obtained in bottles, small size, 2s. 6d., large,

o URSBLVES!
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inc'.usive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask fqr everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the sani“ thing
occurs, and tlie same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big prodts they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contented ness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their service, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is w r orthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDE UN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they W'ork, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
?-
esaaSS
The only really successful prevent*
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most coraplexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skim Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cim-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wkle celebrity, CUTICURA Soap is simply incom
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the I oilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and,most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties- fiom
CUTICURA, the great skin cure, but so delicately arc they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the corn
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

’Twas in the Fraser country, where the coast is
wild and strange;
And “ swagging ” up the long divide that leads to
Daybreak Range
We came, and reached the saddle where the steep
rise starts to slow ;
Then dropped our loads and, resting, gazed upon
the gorge below.
And out beyond we looked towards the faintly-
gleaming sea,
Along the dim horizon-line where forests cease to
be;
And from the white-fringed coast there came the
soft, persistent sound
Of countless sighs that dying waves breathed o’er
their burial-ground.
And then, in strangest humor, borne on Fancy’s
whimsome feet,
Far, far away from Daybreak Range I paced the
crowded street;
The countless thousands passed along with loads
that bent the back—
They carried more than “eighty ” as they strug-
gled up the track !
Some were, alas ! so feeble that they fainted by
the way ;
And some rushed wildly through the throng with
gestures of dismay ;
And some there were of giant strenglh who seemed
to walk in sleep,
And slowly crept with crushing loads in trance
unconscious, deep.
And some I saw whose faces held no human
destiny—
Pale spectres of the men that once they fondly
hoped to be;
And some there were but young in years, yet from
whom Hope had fled, *
To leave them, careless of their chains, in all but
seeming dead !
Then suddenly a sound was heard that thrilled
that toiling band—
A voice that, clear as trumpet-call, went speeding
o’er the land.
And men whose ears were longtime dulhd by
Labor’s iron knell
Stopped still, with leaping hearts, to hear the cry
of “Spell oh ! Spell ! ” '’ ’ • .
Then loads were dropped, and weary forms sank
panting on the ground ;
And Care a moment ceased to brood as respite
sweet was found ;
Whilst haggard faces, in the flush of rest, shone
almost fair,
And silent tongues were loosed, and babbled music
on the air!
And then I woke, or seemed to wake, and on the
j column pressed,
Whilst at its head some unseen band played softly
hymns of rest;
And in their “ homes ” the women of that dumb
and awful crowd
With wasted fingers swiftly sewed another worker’s
shroud.
But oft at night, when heaven hangs close, there
echoes strangely clear
Some semblance of that clarion-call that speaks
the good time near
When voice of man, or voice of God, in accents all
may tell,
Shall wakgn every deadened soul with cry of
“ Spell oh ! Spell ! ”
Yalgoo, W. A.

I HAD NEVER STRUCK A SNAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I had pierced the “Never Never” with a “bluey”
slung behind,
And been caught in “ Darling showers ” that had
driven many blind;
I had “slung the billy” often and possessed a
“ tucker-bag,”
And the only thing that pained me was—l’d never
“struck a snag.”
I had travelled “on the wallalby ” “a paddin’ of
the hoof,”
And much preferred the “ firmament ” to any
other roof;
I had jogged along in company and chatted with
a “ lag,”
And I thought I was a bushman; but I’d never
“struck a snag.”
I had cracked the longest stockwhip that was ever
on a run—
Knew the men that strike the station at the setting
of the sun—
And had “broken” ev’ry “ brumby ” into quite
a decent nag ;
But I sighed and felt a longing—l had never
“ struck a snag.”
I had mined on Waukaringa ere the Doctor oame
to stay,
And was snug among the blankets when the
“ timbers gave away ; ”
I had “shore ” on many stations, and had eaten
of the “’slag;”
But so help me Larry Foley ! I had never
“struck a snag.”
Then one night I struck a shanty where the
crowd was on the wine,
And I sneered and told a fellow that he couldn’t
toe the line;
And it turned out he was shamming, he was what
they term a wag,
And he licked me post to finish—l had struck a
blooming snag.

R.F.D.
TO THE WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Westward the summer whirlwinds go
Through sleepy inland towns,
Now roaring past, then turning slow
Upon the throbbing downs.
Tire camping sheep they scatter wide,
Crossing the dusty roads
The carrier’s children scare, who ride
Perched high upon the loads.
They lift the ashes of dead fires,
And take them where they go,
To watch them quicken vague desires
Dead hopes of long ago.
Of vagrant fancy they take hold,
And, like the columned smoke
That Israel followed far of old
From Egypt’s iron yoke,
They lead us over desert dry,
To where, with whirling hands,
They grasp and circle up on high
Coolgardie’sgolden sands.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE' SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish th% agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THIiBBE CASTLES ” and “ C^k.^ST^lsr.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Villa’ “Three Castles’ ’ and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
k ‘ Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

SATURDAY, JUNE 22, 1895.
Municipal Socialism.
For a number of years past the Democratic
party in Australia has been engaged in a
constant effort to get possession of the
legislatures, and, despite many fluctuations
of fortune, it has accomplished a good deal
in this direction. In Maoriland it has
gained entire control of the Assembly and
partial control of the Council, and has
established a Ministry which, no matter
what mistakes it may have committed, has
done more for the province than the best of
its predecessors. The Democrats of South
Australia have obtained practical command
of both Houses, and there also they have
established a Government which can claim
to have created a better record than any of
its short-lived ancestors, in that land where
Cabinets are born suddenly and die very
young. In the three Eastern provinces a
distinct change for the better is manifest.
The present Tory Ministry in Queensland
sits rather less securely than it did. The
New South Wales Labor-party has been, to
some extent, a failure, mainly by reason of
its aggressive name and its too exclusive
devotion to the interests of the horny-
handed element alone instead of those of
the nation at large ; yet, in an indirect
sense, it has been a great success. Its
own numbers have diminished instead of
increasing, but it has levered the other two
parties out of the bog of hopeless Toryism,
and has familiarised the Assembly with ideas
which were altogether strange to it only ten
years ago. And Victoria, where there is
practically no Labor-party in the Trades Hall
sense, and where The Bulletin sincerely
hopes there will be none in that sense, has
now got what is almost the most progressive
and Liberal Government in Australia. What
the Democratic party has accomplished may
seem very little, but if the Australasia of ’95
is compared with that of ’B5 then the amount
that has been done is remarkable. The only
thing that is still more remarkable is the
amount which remains to be done in the
future.
# # *
On one point, however, the Democratic
party has been strikingly remiss. It has put
forth all its efforts to capture the Legisla-
tures, and yet, in most cases, it has left the
municipal councils to be dominated as before
by the butcher-alderman, and the auctioneer,
and the other unprogressive elements of the
community. In isolated cases some good
has been done, but no combined or well-
organised effort has been made. There are
any number of visible reasons for this
neglect. As matters are at present, very
little glory attaches to the position of aider-
man. There are no rousing party fights, few
chances for flights of gaudy oratory, no
reports in Hansard, no Government to be
overturned, no portfolios to bo distributed,
no free passes, no admiring constituents —
nothing. The average alderman is a dull
and stupid person and an object of contempt.
He attends in a dreary fashion at a periodical
meeting, and muddles clumsily through cer-
tain solemn routine business concerning
drainage and paving, and his ideas of finance
generally consist in borrowing at an exor-
bitant rate of interest from somebody named
Cohen, and struggling ever afterwards to
raise enough money to pay the interest.
And when this device fails, his only remain-
ing idea is to get a helpless kind of over-
draft at 8 per cent. The typical alderman
is a person with large hands, and hair that
stands up on end, and a feebly unconvincing
aspect generally. And, as a consequence of
all this, the typical municipality is a neg-
lected, unkempt, and badly-paved place with
as much mortgage as it can stagger under —a
place which is badly lighted by contract with
a gas company, badly drained on no parti-
cular principle, scavenged by an unsavoury
cart which goes around like a thief in the
night, built up on no definite plan, and alto-
gether unprogressive.
# • «
Two weeks ago The Bulletin published,
under the heading of “A Model Munici-
pality,” an account of what has been done in
Glasgow by a vigorous and enlightened local
authority. In that city, which is now re-
garded as the best-governed in the United
Kingdom, and one of the best-governed in
the world, the city father has ceased to
be an object of scorn and a synonym for
stupidity, The Corporation of Glasgow
owns and personally manages the tramways,
water-supply, gas and electric-lighting works,
parks, recreation - grounds, public wash-
houses, gymnasia, swimming and other baths,
sewage farms, dessicating works, model-
lodging houses, model tenements for work-
men’s families, fire-brigades, and many other
works. It is constantly employed in de-
molishing unsavory slums and replacing
them with fine buildings and wide streets.
It is one of the largest, most considerate,
and least exorbitant landlords in the city.
It has enormously reduced the prices of gas
and water since it took them under its man-
agement, and now supplies them at a lower
rate than any other corporation or private
co. in Great Britain. Since it took over the
tramways it has reduced the fares, raised
the wages of the employes, and shortened
their hours. And with all this it not only
makes a steady and continuous reduction in
rates, and meets the interest on its liabilities
punctually, but is gradually paying off the
principal of its debts by means of sinking
funds. This is the sort of example which
the cities and towns of Australia should
follow, and they will begin to follow it when
an intelligent Democratic party—if, as The
Bulletin sincerely trusts, there is such a
thing—captures the municipalities. It is as
essential to do this as it is to capture the
Legislatures, and the fact that the old-
fashioned, slow-going variety of alderman
with the cart-horse soul has been generally
left in possession is the sole reason for the
general want of municipal enterprise in Aus-
tralia.
• • •
The experience of Great Britain is an evi-
dence that State Socialism cannot be brought
about by the Legislature alone. That
country was, a few years ago, pre-eminently
the homo of “private enterprise.” It is
still the home of private enterprise, but to a
greatly diminished extent. The Britons
had—and some Britons still have—a fixed
idea that the management of any business
undertaking by the people’s representatives
is an expensive calamity. In these days
any proposal that the Legislature should en-
courage the municipalisation of such exten-
sive works as those now carried out by the
corporations of Glasgow and many other
cities, would have been met by the unani-
mous reply that the scheme was visionary,
hopeless and ridiculous. If the necessary
authority had been granted it would have
led to little or nothing, for the old, stolid,
slow-going variety of municipal potentate
was as deeply convinced of the advantages
of private enterprise as the rest of the popu-
lation. Parliamentary eloquence alone
would have done little or nothing to alter
this state of things, even if there had been
any party which desired to be eloquent on
the subject, for Parliamentary eloquence,
on such a matter, and at that time, was mere
theory. But one democratic corporation
upset the old-established convictions of the
nation by simply doing that which the great
majority regarded as impossible. It proved
that municipal socialism, under intelligent
control, was cheaper and more effective than
private ownership, and that in a vast num-
ber of industries private enterprise was, by
comparison, antiquated, unsatisfactory and
unprogreasive. That one example did more
to upset Monopoly than could have been
effected by volumes of eloquent denuncia-
tion and innumerable political platforms.
Other cities, almost of necessity, adopted
the same system in steadily increasing num-
bers, and, as a consequence, it seems likely
that, in a few years, Britain will leave Aus-
tralia far behind in socialistic progress.
* * •
It is necessary that State and municipal
socialism should go hand in hand. There is
an increasing tendency, of late years, to
delegate more and more of the duties of
government to local bodies, for as popula-
tion increases, and the State machine grows
more complex, the burden of details becomes
more than the central authority can stagger
under. The central authority makes laws,
but their administration is left, to a
very large extent, to local institutions.
Therefore, when the Democratic party
exerts itself to control the authority
which makes the laws, and leaves almost
anybody who likes to run that one which
so largely administers them, it makes an
obvious mistake. A democratic majority in
the Legislature may authorise the local
authorities to supply and control water, gas
and electric-light supply, tramways, hospitals
and the like, but unless it takes hold of the
other end of the machine also it can’t make
them do it, or, at all events, it can’t make
them do it except in a way which will bring
the principle of national enterprise into
contempt. It can pass elaborate laws
whereby local bodies are authorised to raise
money for sewerage and road-making pur-
poses, to resume slum properties and replace
them with well-built and wholesome struc-
tures, to make parks and recreation-grounds,
to beautify the streets with trees, to regulate
building operations so as to obtain some
semblance of architectural seemliness, and
to do innumerable other things —in fact,
there is nothing that an intelligent Legisla-
ture cannot authorise the local rulers to do.
But unless intelligence and a progressive
spirit are instilled into the corporations thus
authorised, the money will still be raised in
a ruinous fashion, the roads and sewers will
be neglected, the attempts at sanitation,
architectural adornment and artistic comeli-
ness will be done, if they are done at all,
strictly according to the local butcher’s
ideas of art, and the result will be general
failure. Progress is made up of an in-
finity of details, and as it is necessary to
leave much of the detail of government to
local authority it is essential that the pro-
gressive party should control the local
authority, Otherwise the result will be
much the same as if the Legislature author-
ised an ox to be a racehorse, and left him at
that.
In one sense democratic control of
municipal affairs yields more immediate
returns than democratic control of the
Legislature. The progressive party desires
to promote public enterprise as distin-
guished from private monopoly. But its
efforts are woefully hampered by the system
of Government by Contradiction ; hythe cum-
bersome and elaborate forms of Parliament ;
by motions of censure and adjournment ; by
the opposition of the Upper House ; and
many other difficulties. Local bodies have
none of these obstacles to contend with.
They have already extensive powers, and
these, if intelligently used, would serve to
demonstrate the practicability of municipal
socialism, which is simply State socialism in
a subdivided form ; and by such demon-
stration they would make converts and
vastly strengthen their party. As matters
now stand, the local bodies have the power
of doing much good in their own limited
sphere, while the Legislature, reduced to
comparative impotence by its own forms and
ceremonies, has the power to talk of doing
much good to the country at large, and
seldom gets very far beyond that, except by
a superlative and unwonted effort. And the
party of progress almost utterly neglects the
smaller and more workable machine in its
wholly commendable efforts to get hold of
the one which is unwieldy, rusted, and
almost unworkable.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Democratic Isaacs.
The legal mind is astonishingly narrow and
restricted—a circumstance which is probably
traceable to the law rather than to the mind,
The raw material of which lawyers are con-
structed is probably as Democratic as the
average, but the finished lawyer hardly ever
remains Democratic. Law is mainly precedent,
and precedent involves a constant struggle to
do exactly as our dull forefathers did, and this
perpetual looking backwards is fata! to
originality. Isaac A. Isaacs, the present Vic-
torian Attorney-General, bears the reputation
of being unusually liberal and progressive for a
member of his hide-bound trade, and the other
day the Vic. Parliament got the exact measure
of his progressiveness. One of the numerous
Smiths who infest the Legislature asked if the
Government would appoint a Crown Defender,
with a staff of assistants similar to that
of i the Crown Prosecutor, to look after
the interests of penniless prisoners. The
proposal looks simple and equitable enough, and
almost every intelligent layman now holds that
a Public Defender is one of the most urgent re-
quirements of the day. But Isaac A. Isaacs,
Attorney-General, was flabbergasted at the
mere mention of such a thing, and professed
himself utterly unable to take the proposal
seriously. Also, he failed to understand how
anybody else could take it seriously. It would
mean, said Isaacs, with unspeakable scorn,
that “ society, which has an interest in getting
rogues into gaol, would actually be paying to
keep them out.” All the lawyers applauded,
The House applauded. The Argus applauded.
And Isaacs evidently thought—and, perhaps,
still thinks—that he had said something pro-
found and logical. Of course, if every man
who was put in the dock was a rogue —if the
law never made a mistake, and put an honest
man behind the spikes, and left the real crimi-
nal outside —then the law would he paying to
keep rogues out of gaol. When Isaacs stated
the case that way, he distinctly implied that
the man arrested is always—invariably —with-
out any possible exception whatever, a rogue ;
consequently, according to Isaacs’ logic, the
money spent on paying a Crown Prosecutor,
Judge, jury, &c., to prove that he is a rogue, is
pure waste. He is a rogue simply because an
information was sworn against him, and that
ends the matter, and his guilt might as well he
taken for granted. The fact that the law
sometimes arrests the wrong man—that society
doesn’t want to gaol the wrong man, because
sending a man to gaol for a crime he didn’t
commit generally means leaving the ruffian who
did commit it at large—that it can’t be reason-
ably sure of getting the rogue it really
wants unless both sides of the case are fairly
presented at the trial—that both sides can’t be
fairly presented unless the defence is as well
conducted as the prosecution—and that that is
wholly impossible when a penniless prisoner is
fighting against the Treasury and the best legal
talent in the country—not one of these things
has ever yet occurred to Isaacs. To him the
law is apparently a machine for getting into
gaol, by fair means or foul, every man whom
any dunderheaded constable may happen to
arrest. And yet IsaaG A. Isaacs is reputed to
be an enlightened and Democratic member of
his profession. If he is, then what, in the
name of the great primitive Ape, can the others
be like ?
The N.S.W. “Tote” Bill.
The New South Wales Totalisator Bill of
Nicholas Willis, M.L.A., provides :
That yearly licenses shall he granted for the use of the
instrument by the Colonial Secretary to any racing club
giving in stakes at least £6OO at every day's racing held
by it, at which the totalisator shall be used. Every such
club, if its race meetings are held within 20 miles of
Sydney, must have at least 100 members. For clubs
beyond that radius they must have at least 50 members,
exclusive of those who may be members of any other
racing club, and their daily prize-list must be of the
value of not less than £3OO. Every member must be a
subscriber of a guinea or upwards a year, and the license
fee for a totalisator shall be £25, in addition to £lO per
day for et ery day on which it is used. The clubs are to
be allowed to retain only 10 per cent, of the takings as
commission, and this money must be expended in stakes
for the legitimate encouragement of racing. A fourth of
the net profits are to be paid to a fund known as the sup-
port of charities fund, which shall be disposed of annually
by the Colonial Secretary. Each club shall only be
allowed the use of the instrument on eight days in each
year, and it must not be used on any one racecourse for
more than 20 days in a year.
All these elaborate restrictions are evidently
intended as concessions to the snufflebusting
element of the community, which won’t grab
the unclean thing with both hands, but may
possibly he willing to touch it, in a shocked
sort of fashion, with the point of one finger.
But there is altogether too much restriction in
the matter. The object of the legalised machine is
to suppress the bookmaker and the surreptitious
machine with the “faked” returns; and the
more difficulties placed in the way of its
use, the more scope is left for the “ bookie” to
avoid being suppressed and for the surreptitious
implement to survive. If it is advisable that
the honest “ tote ” should take the place of the
raucous and dishonest live-meat metallician, then
it is advisable that it should do so on every day
and at every place where racing is conducted, in-
stead of merely eight times a year for each club
and 20 days in the year on each racecourse. If
this restriction is intended to imply that no
duh should race more than eight days per
annum, and that no racecourse should be used
more than 20 days in the year, then the Bill
ought to go at the matter straight instead of ap-
proaching it sideways—in other words, it should
enact that no club shall race more than eight
days a year, instead of enacting that it may
only hold eight days’ honest sport and as many
more days of the dishonest variety as it pleases.
The assumption that the tote is so much better
than the bookmaker that the Legislature should
lend it special encouragement, and yet so much
worse that it should be hampered by all manner
of vexatious restrictions from which the garish
“penciller” is free, is wholly illogical.
Therefore, The Bulletin moves that the
conditions under which the instrument is-
used should be reduced to two: (1) The
licence fee to be paid to Government
shall be £25, and £lO for each day the instru-
ment is used; (2) the racing club shall de-
duct 10 per cent, from the takings, and shall
expend three-fourths of this amount in stakes
and pay one-fourth to a charities fund. These
conditions are sufficiently stringent to shut out-
all the small, wild-cat clubs* and to prevent the
instrument being used for more days in the
year than is good for its health, or being em-
ployed by private racecourse owners for their
own benefit. The totalisator is a necessary
evil, like alcohol, and should be dealt with
accordingly. The State recognises that people
will drink, so it allows them to do so, but put*
on the brake by raising the price of liquor
through Customs and Excise duties. No one
ever struck the idea of further enacting that
drink should not be sold more than 20 days in the
year in one place, or that no club of less than
100 members should be allowed to drink at all,
and that even it should drink only eight times
a year.
Prior Vaughan’s Mission.
There is no insolence like the insolence of
ecclesiastics. A demagogue may be silenced
by a noisier demagogue ; there are joints in the
armor of the most impudent quack ; the show-
man’s brazen face is only a mask. But the
priests of all religions achieve impossibilities
denied to the gods from whom they claim to
draw their authority ; out-Herod Herod, and
out-face Omnipotence itself. Logic is ridiculed,
facts are defied, by the servants of superstition.
They believe, not because of evidence, but in
spite of evidence. Doubtless, from a certain
class of minds, Prior Vaughan’s assertions will
find credence, and his mission will receive sup-
port. It is for that other class which is for-


tunately increasing in Australia the class
which will not believe that day is night
because a black-coat says so—that this paper
briefly points out Prior Vaughan’s title to
be deemed a reed shaken by the wind of error.
Prior Vaughan is a modern begging-friar come
to empty Australian purses. He wishes to
bring ‘ ‘ religion ” to the English poor. He
implies that the Gregorian order of priests, for
which he collects, teaches unsectarian Christi-
anity, though a purely R.O. brotherhood. It
may, or it may not. The Bulletin does not
know. But consider the history of the Church
of Rome, “ compassing land and sea to make
one proselyte consider that it is this church’s
boast that its creed is unchangeable ; consider
that at the present moment the head of this
church is leading a crusade to proselytise Pro-
testant England ; and say whether it is likely
that the Gregorian mission is unsectarian. Let
Apella the Jew believe it : Australians will
not. Can Prior Vaughan specifically say
that it is possible for Catholic priests to
teach religion without teaching the Catholic
creed, and can he specifically say that the
Gregorian missionaries have not taught, do not
teach, and will not teach the Catholic creed ?
Further, supposing the Gregorian mission un-
sectarian, it is no part of Australia’s duty to
take “religion” to England at present. Let
her first set her own house in order. There is
more religious work to be done among the slums
of Australian cities and in the solitudes of the
Australian bush than this generation will ever
accomplish. Australian missions languish for
lack of funds : better sweep our own doorstep
before taking a hypocritical broom to England.
Again, England wants not more religion, but
less. Prior Vaughan comments on the
modern spread of irreligion in England,
and descants upon its awful results of
poverty and crime. Yet, partly because
the decay of religion is accompanied by the
growth of knowledge, the standard of national
life in Great Britain is steadily rising. During
the last 22 years criminal convictions in the
United Kingdom have declined 37 per cent.
(Mulhall’s Statistics, ’92). The annual death-
rate per 1000 in England and Wales (same
authority) shows a decrease from 22 - 4 in 1841-50
to 19’3 in 1881-85. As to poverty, since 1849,
“ with a constantly increasing population there
is an absolute decline in the amount of pauper-
ism ” (Gifeen’s “Progress of the Working
Classes in the Last Half-Century ”). The same
authority shows that working-class wages have
increased relatively as wellas absolutely, and that
working-class savings have largely increased.
These conclusions are solid and undeniable ;
and are accepted as final by everyone competent
to weigh the value of evidence. London
Morning Post, of April 9 last, says that during
the Commons’ debate on the Local Option Bill,
Sir Edward Clarke “showed how 23 years
ago Sir William Harcourt had himself con-
clusively demonstrated from the statistics of
the Home Office and the Local Govt. Board
that crime and disease and poverty were dimi-
nishing, and bringing those statistics up to date,
he further proved that this desirable social
progress has been continuous and permanent.”
Since, then, there has been an improvement in
the chief conditions of British national existence
almost contemporaneous with the decay of
religion lamented by Prior Vaughan, it is clear
that if Australia sends missionaries to England
at all, she should rather send them to spread
irreligion than religion, since the spread of
irreligion means the spread of knowledge, and
the spread of knowledge means the improve-
ment of morals, the lengthening of life and the
filling of pockets.
Law versus Justice.
Editor Bulletin. —Sir, re your remarks about
Vic. Full Court capsizing the verdict for £6OO
damages given by the jury in the Kilpatrick
v. Huddart, Parker & Co. case. Many
reasons were given by their Honors for grant-
ing a new trial, but one of the principal ones
was apparently based on the fact that the cer-
tificates given by Melb. Marine Board gave
carte blanche to the Alert’s owners. Now,
the fact should be mentioned that two
members of the Marine Board are also
members of the firm of Huddart, Parker &
Co. In my opinion, it would be a
wiser plan to have Marine Boards composed
of men who are not shipowners. We all know
that in this world it is not enough to do right.
We must go further and make things look right.
During the arguments in the Alert case—
which I, being a seaman of experience,
daily listened to with interest —Chief Justice
Madden not only attached great weight to the
certificates, but he also argued inferentially
that if there had been anything materially
wrong with the Alert, either in shape, con-
struction, or rig, someone in, or connected with,
the vessel would have drawn attention to the de-
fect. To quote his own words : “ I think the man
would be a wicked one who, knowing the un-
seaworthy condition of a vessel, did not report
it to the proper authorities.” A healthy senti-
ment, but much depends upon circumstances.
There are positions wherein men can report
defects in anything, and get praise—as they
should—for doing so, and there are also posi-
tions wherein men, on shore, if they drew atten-
tion to defects, would be instantly “sacked”
from their employment, and, if on board ship,
would, in all probability, be sent to gaol as
wicked, designing men ! For instance : Some
three weeks after the jury brought in a
verdict in favor of Mrs. Kilpatrick, I, at
his own request, interviewed a seaman on board
of a steamer then lying in the Yarra. He made
a statement which I took down in writing and,
after reading same over to him, he, in my
presence, declared it was true in every particu-
lar. Here it is :
My name is . lam an able seaman. I came
out to Melb. as such in the barque Alert. She was a long,
narrow and shallow vessel built for a river steamer, but
we brought her out under sail only. Her machinery was
in position but her funnels were not, they were stowed
below. In the first instance she sailed for Melb. from
Greenock, and after being a week at sea the crew refn ■ <1
to go any further in her. They went aft in a body ml
desired the captain to put the ship into the ne i -,i.
port. Accordingly, the Alert was taken into the thnl-
well Roads, Cardigan Bay, Wales, where the crew
were taken ashore, tried for refusing duty and sent
to gaol for six weeks. At the earnest request of the men
a surveyor was sent to examine the ship. He stated that
the men had a just cause of complaint, and pronounced
the Alert unseaworthy. The magistrates on learning this
at once made an order-releasing the men from confine-
ment. A new crew was shipped, of whom I was one, but,
owing to the name the vessel had got and the extra risk
to run, we demanded and got £3 15s. per month, the t hen
highest wages out of the port. During a period of three
weeks we made 15 attempts to get the Alert out of the
Bay, and 15 times she had to go back to her anchorage.
The reason we could not get outside was because the
wind was not fair and the ship would not stay. There
was not room enough to wear her round, so there was
nothing for it but go back each time. At last a slant
of wind was got and we sailed for Melbourne. Prior
to leaving Stidwell Hoads, the authorities on shore
told us that, although we had signed articles, we
need hot go to sea in the ship unless we liked, and
Capt. Webb, to encourage us, said he was going out him-
self as a passenger to Melb. At the last moment he
changed his mind and did not come with us. The Alert
carried eight hands, all told. She was very crank, or
tender, and every night at sundown, fine or foul, the top
gallant sails were taken in and stowed. At no time
during the passage out would the vessel stay. When we
wanted to put her on the other tack we had always to
wear her round. She was loaded with ballast and trimmed
on a fairly even keel. The decks were never dry except
during calms. Frequently a lot of water got into the
saloon and was got out by all hands baling with buckets.
In one breeze we had she shipped d sea over the quarter
which smashed in the skylight and carried away the
wheel and binnacle. We were about five months coming
out, and ran short of provisions on the way. Ido not
remember a pantry window in front of the poop. If there
was one it must have been covered over, for I never saw
it, or heard of it at any time. We never expected to
reach Melb. in her. She was a dangerous vessel and not
fit, in a breeze with a seaway, to either stay, wear or run.
I would not ship in her again under any circumstances.
When the vessel lam now in was in Q’sland, I read there
some account of the trial, and was sorry that, I was not in
Melb. to give evidence as to what I knew of the Alert.
Such is said to have been the ship which
held certificates that she was “ fit to carry dry
cargo to any part of the world.” It certificates
are incontestable proof of a ship’s seaworthiness,
how did Mr. Plimsoll manage to stop so many
certificated ships from going to sea ? The wreck
of such a vessel as the Alfcrt shows that
there is need enough of an Australian Plimsoll,
and the result of the Full Court’s decision shows
that Macklin was not far wrong when he said:
“The law is a sort of hocus-pocus science that
smiles in yer face while it picks yer pocket,
and the glorious uncertainty of it is mair use to
the professors than the justice of it.”— Tom
Cringle, Melbourne. June 1, 1895.
Beauty before Duty.
The Turner Government’s proposal to save
some £19,000 a year in the working of the Vic.
Education Department has been defeated by a
large majority, therefore 190 superfluous civil
servants who thought they were pensioned off
are again doing nothing in particular at the
same salaries as before. Conscientious objec-
tion to pensions is the foremost reason advanced
for annulling this particular retrenchment
scheme, although the discomfiture of Turner
& Co. was seemingly due to the influence of 28
married lady teachers, who, having been re-
tired last year from their billets without
pensions, but with compensation, are ob-
jects of sympathy to Hancock and other
soulful members of the Victorian Assembly.
Twenty-eight members only had previously
voted for granting pensions to the 28 matrons
aforesaid one member for each matron,
as was wickedly remarked and 20 of
these susceptible creatures were included in the
majority (51 to 35) which refused to permit the
Government to get rid of 190 other civil servants
by pensioning them. Premier Turner made
out a good case for the Government. He told
his turbulent party that “The great object of
the Bill was to enable the saving to take place
at once, and it would increase every year,
because the persons retiring would get incre-
ments if they remained in the service. There
would, of course, be a larger saving if all these
servants were dispensed with at once, than by
retiring them on pensions ; but the Govern-
ment was not justified in dismissing a large
number to swell the ranks of the unemployed,
though it was justified in allowing servants who
could be dispensed with to retire voluntarily,
and give them the pensions they had earned
for the time they had served. That was the dif-
ference between the policy of the present and
the late Government.” It was not proposed
to give full superannuation pensions, but
merely as much retiring allowance as each
official had earned up to date. The House
had to choose between two unavoidable evils
bred by the corrupt extravagance of the
Gillies regime : the larger evil of retain-
ing unnecessary civil servants who have a
legitimate claim to fair treatment, and the
smaller evil of getting rid of them on the
cheapest terms consistent with justice. Justice,
it is true, seldom rules in private commercial
business, where servants are “sacked” with
cold-blooded contempt for any claims they may
have established to their employers’ considera-
tion. Yet, unless the Vic. Assembly was pre-
pared (which it wasn’t) to demand the uncon-
ditional dismissal of these 190 persons, it had
to accept one or other of the expensive alterna-
tives aforesaid. A mixed majority, including
all the Opposition and many professed Radicals,
chose the alternative which costs an extra
£19,000 a year. A glance at the division-lists
reveals the true cause of this Government
defeat. The 28 married lady-teachers were
responsible for it. Hancock and Co. practically
stipulated for the pensioning of these lovely
lobbyists as the condition on which they would
support pensions in general, and, when Turner
steeled his heart against the two dozen and
four matrons, Hancock and Co. decided that
the country had got to “ jolly well suffer.”
“ Made in Victoria.”
F. : The Bulletin says that the Vic. Tariff
Board’s proposal that local manufactures should
be branded “ Made in Victoria ”is “ like poll-
taxing the white man to discourage the China-
man.” If the local manufacturers were any-
thing more than plagiarists and imitators they
might deserve generous treatment. But it is
because they have been disguising their pro-
ducts as imports that the results of Protection
are not overwhelming proof of the advantages
of the system. Hundreds of people who will-
ingly wear imported boots made in Colling-
wood, are ready to swear that “ colonial
boots ” are rubbish. Not one hat-factory
has the pluck to put its own brand
on its goods. Quite lately a woollen-mill
has taken to advertising its rugs, but the cir-
cumstance is unique in that trade. Cigars and
cigarettes are put on the market under a foreign-
sounding name, and packed in boxes that are a
colorable imitation of foreign packages. One
big firm supplies a cigar that is a, fac-simile of a
certain well-advertised foreign cigar this
“colonial” cigar is bought by publicans and
tobacconists and put in genuine boxes and sold
as an imported cigar. Further, it is within 1
per cent, of the quality it pretends to be, and
is quite good enough to sell on its merits, be-
cause it is 10s. per 100 cheaper. Vic. twine,
Vic. hats, Vic. boots, the best Vic. tweed are
good enough for anywhere, but the pestilent
underhand methods of the protected manufac-
turer go a long way to impede success. It is
asserted that the recent European treaty re-
garding the branding of goods with the country
of their origin “made in Germany,” &c., has
served as an advt. and impetus to trade for the
countries concerned. Here is a slab from an
English Parliamentary report concerning India
since this treaty :
An examination of the returns tends to support the con-
clusion that in respect to British manufactures, Con-
tinental competition is gradually making its way, and in
respect to Continental goods, of which the United King-
dom was the dep6t for shipment, the trade with India is
being conducted direct in an increasing degree.
Some of this British unsupremacy is un-
doubtedly due to the eternal verities of Free
Raid, but it is also maintained that the selling
of a good article on its own merits has ad-
vanced the success of Belgium and Germany in
India, and elsewhere. Similarly in Vic. the
local manufacturers would be advantaged by a
little compulsory honesty.
A Hazy Divine.
Rev. Dr. Torrance, discoursing on “Political
corruption ” from his Melb. pulpit, shows how
dangerous it is for a parson to stray from the
beaten track in response to the alleged yearning
of the people for enlightenment on domestic
and political affairs from the “ cludgy.” “ Poli-
tical corruption ” is a comprehensive theme in
the City of Dreadful Knights; but the reverend
handled it with pitiful weakness and a palpable
anxiety to commend his spineless discourse to a
bedizened audience, the main portion of which
was red-jowled and paunchy. Dr. Torrance
is evidently desirous of being considered
a devil of a fellow, and, in his fiercer moments,
is suggestive of the Rev. Mr. Spalding when
fully roused, and threatening to give somebody
“ a real hard knock.” Talking big-and-large,
he hurled at Parliament most of the defamatory
adjectives that have been thrown in the teeth
of the Church for ages, but his only attempt to
particularise the corruptionists, log-rollers,
place-hunters, and so on, was when he re-
marked, grandly : “ We want men of character
in the House, and men of character to return
them. We do not want men who are mere
talkers or blatant democrats, but men of true
religious instincts.” Then he instanced Higin-
botham as the kind of politician he did want,
which was somewhat paradoxical on the part of
the wandering pulpiteer, as Higinbotham per-
sonified most of the principles Dr. Torrance
most vigorously abused—he was an “irreligious”
person, a manhood-suffragist, favored payment
of members, and backed-up the labor move-
ment, all of which things are anathema to the
right-thinking person who goes to church morn-
ing and evening, and believes in the Divine
right of the upper-classes. But The Bulletin
admires the stupendous presumption of the
clerical Tory who—standing amidst the ruins of
scores of pious reputations, in the thick of a
tremendous social smash brought about by the
chicanery and chartered brigandage of a set of
men who were elevated to power because of
their duly advertised “religious instincts,” and
who hated manhood suffrage and all democracy—
implicates only the Labor-party, the one set of
men who have come through the days of
abomination with clean hands and unsmirched
character, in his denunciation of the corrup-
tionist, the sycophant, and the self-seeker. It is
best, after all, for the average parson to “ lay
to his Book ” —the masses don’t pay him to
teach them, and the classes won’t. Even the
latter appreciate him better as a soporific than
an eye-opener.

that economic science is all wrong, since it
disagrees with Christ. The inference that
obviously should be drawn is that Christ is
some 1865 years behind the age —or in front of
it, as you please. Economics are based on
experience—things as they are. Christ’s teach-
ing is based on hopes and longings—things as
we might like them to be. Plainly, Christ is
an unsafe guide. As Bishop Magee said, “ a
State which transacted its business on the prin-
ciples of the Sermon in the Mount would not
exist for a week.” “Resist not evil” is a
pusillanimous precept, an encouragement and
defence to brutality and tyranny. “Give to
him that asketh thee” deprives industry of its
legitimate reward, and is coolly disregarded by
the holiest elder who sands sugar. So with
others. We live in earth, not Heaven ; and
Christ’s most vital maxims are more applicable
to Heaven than to earth. It is no use kicking
against the pricks. Human nature sticks out
all round us, and economics are the essence of
human nature. You can’t bridge here and
hereafter in a day or a generation. Begin
building, by all means ; but you must use the
materials to hand. The conditions neces-
sary for the success of Christ’s principles
aren’t to hand —are not within centuries of us.
So we must just use principles applicable to the
conditions which are to hand —drive our nail as
far as it will go, and not an inch farther.
And, as the Rev. C. W. Stubbs knows quite
well that this is so, and gets .£I4OO a year as
Dean of Ely because it is so, and doesn’t in the
least propose to carry the teaching of Christ
in his own person further than employing it to
make a neat literary antithesis, one wonders
why so many people rave and imagine a vain
thing at his bidding or suggestion.

An Alleged “ Sacrifice.”
So much has been said about the alleged
£550,000 which the Reid Cabinet is sacrificing
by abolishing the duties levied under the recent
Dibbs Government that very few people seem
to have noticed up to date that the “ sacrifice ”
is altogether bogus. It is bogus, none the less,
and, as a consequence, the promise that the
taxpayer will be relieved of £550,000 of Customs
taxation is equally bogus. The relief, to those
who look merely on the surface of things, ap-
pears sufficiently real, inasmuch as certain
duties, which now yield £550,000 per annum,
are to be abolished ; but the matter won’t bear
intelligent inspection. Reid prox>oses, for the
time being, to revert to the old Parkes tariff,
which yielded about £1,900,000 per annum from
Customs alone. When the Dibbs tariff came into
force the Customs revenue boomed for the first
year to £2,677,000. But all Protectionist tariffs
tend to reduce Customs revenue by discourag-
ing imports and encouraging local production,
and, as usual, imports diminished in New South
Wales, and local supplies increased. The
Customs revenue for ’93 dropped to £2,127,000.
In ’94 it further dropped to £2,072,000 ; and
the returns for ’95, so far as they are available,
suggest that it has now got down toashadeunder
£2,ooo,oooperannum. Premier Reid proposes to
replace this with that reliable old tariff which
grinds out £1,900,000 or so per annum with
such beautiful regularity, and calls the dif-
ference a remission of £550,000, whereas it is
really less than one-fifth of that amount. The
increase in the quantity of imports under the
low tariff almost makes up for the difference in
duties, according to all past experience, and
the alteration in the “ burden” is hardly worth
mentioning. The Bulletin is getting tired of
that bogus “sacrifice.” It is also tired of the
companion statement that the Government
can’t carry out its policy unless it gets the land
and income tax to fill the gap in the revenue,
for by establishing a revenue tariff instead of
its much-promised Freetrade policy, it has care-
fully avoided creating any gap.
Much of the trafficking in forbidden articles,
insuppressible now in Australian prisons, would
be discontinued if the French system of “ can-
teen ” were introduced. Under this a prisoner
can spend daily at the gaol-store a certain por-
tion of his earnings. The privilege, which is
eminently equitable, produces quite a crop of
beneficial results. In the first place, it mini-
mising trafficking, it being recognised that the
prisoner is entitled to purchase, with his own
money, harmless luxuries such as tobacco and
cheese, which otherwise he would, often success-
fully, seek to obtain illicitly. Then it permits
the well-behaved man to immediately enjoy the
fruits of his good conduct. To be debarred
from “ canteen ” for a week, is, to the French
detenu, a serious punishment. Not so is the
deprivation of a dozen marks or so under the
artificial English system, which makes both its
penalties and awards too remote. A man
naturally feels the immediate lopping-off of
luxuries more than he would an addition of a
week to his sentence of years. The very fact
that one penalty is more human than the other
makes it more impressive. Finally, when
prisoners daily handle their earnings, and when
those earnings fluctuate according to industry,
the stimulus to work is far greater and healthier
than that of gaining the three extra marks which
represent a quarter of a day’s remission of sen-
tence. Criminals, above all other men, live for
the day. The Bulletin hopes that some en-
lightened prison administrator in Australia, if
such a being exists, will urge his Government
to give “ canteen ” a trial. The cat and gag
have had a fair innings ; and a change to some-
thing sensible is about due.
The Conservative ex-Minister Lyne obstinately
believes that Party Government—the Govern-
ment by Contradiction that is responsible for so
many evils—cannot be improved upon. Said
he lately at Warren (N.S.W.):
I do not believe in an independent man or an independ-
ent party. There should be Her Majesty’s Ministers, and
Her Majesty’s Opposition, and their struggles should be
conducted on true party lines.
Mr. Lyne is presumably sane. He is pre
sumably observant. He must needs see around
him M.’sP. who are Freetraders, land-taxers and
income-taxers; members who are Protection, sts,

and opposed to some direct taxation; Protec-
tionists, ditto; again, the two main classes of
fiscalists variously sub-divided individually, this
way, that way, criss-cross, under and over, as
regards Federation, local government, the cur-
rency, the military vote, educational questions,
the grog question, &c., &c. Yet he would

opinions in order to blindly vote with that

questions, many aspects.
N.S.W. Justice Minister Slattery got his
prison-gag regulations almost word for word
from the Queensland gaol code, apropos of
which the following extract from Kinnaird
Rose and Parry Okeden’s sensational report,
in ’B9, on Q. gaols is curious reading : 4
The evidence before us does not convince us that the
lash or the trax improves discipline, but the contrary.
The gag has been abolished in New South Wales, and, so
far as we can ascertain, in England. We recommend that
the use of the gag should be abolished.
That recommendation was ignored, and now, as
a consequence, New South Wales quotes
Queensland in justification of the barbarous
instrument! In Victoria the gag is not
authorised, but, all the same, it is sometimes
used. Only very rarely, however, because the
dark and “dumb” cell, in small doses, is
found equally effective and much more humane.
Flogging for offences committed in prison is
legalised in Queensland, New South Wales, and
South Australia. Victoria is following suit, in
deference to the persistent appeal of Inspector-
General Evans, whose naval experience has
naturally afflicted him with an insatiable crav-
ing for “ cat.” Last session, the Bill providing
for the infliction of the lash was slaughtered,
but that is to be avoided this Parliament by
the earlier introduction of the measure. On the
whole, therefore, Australia, in the matter of
criminology, is admirably maintaining its pres-
tige for crablike progress.
The Economist, commenting on Judge Moles-
worth’s recent outbreak in Melb. Insolvency
Court, says : “ Until the Judges are absolutely
independent, it is scarcely to be wondered at
if British investors fear lest political exigency
should defeat justice in Victoria.” Until
Judges hold aloof from Fat Man gatherings
and refrain from hobnobbing with “ representa-
tive ” persons, at home or abroad ; until they
cut all connection with Guvment House, finan-
cial speculation, freemasonry, and parlia-
mentary theatre-parties, they will never be
independent. Molesworth, notwithstanding
that his salary remains subject to political in-
fluence, is probably the most independent Judge
of the whole crowd. Anyhow, he is less
friendly with Fat Man than are some of his col-
leagues. How can Chief Justice Madden —no
matter how honest his intention, he is still but
human ! —be regarded as independent ? He
plays, with infinite relish, the part of Acting-
Governor ; the Speaker and Premier are his
two nearest official relatives, “ everybody who
is anybody ” becomes more or less friendly with
his wife and family. He is socially “ nobbled ”
every day of his life, though he receives a
very large salary (to say nothing of his huge
prospective pension), which was in part surely
intended to be the price of his social isolation.
Had he been Acting-Governor five years ago
the officials who were the chief apostles of the
Boom would have figured as his chief disciples
at levees and solemn functions in general. He
does all that he ought not to do if he
wishes to be, and to be regarded as being a fit
and proper person to preside over the adminis-
tration of justice when the next land-boom
bursts, and the next lot of mushroom bankers
fall due for punishment, and the subtlest and
most adroit of “influences” come forward to
protect them. Experience has proved that the
occupants of high places in Victoria are the
most likely to put themselves within reach of
the criminal law—the criminal law’s indisposi-
tion to grab hold of them doesn’t affect the
argument—and yet the chuckle-headed public
fail to observe the sin of an arrangement which
places the Chief Justice in close official and
social intercourse with a possible den of thieves.
This is wild talk, maybe. But there’s a lot of
truth sandwiched between the shrieks.

The friendly understanding between China
and Russia (evidenced by Russia’s undertaking to
guarantee the imminent Chinese £17,000,000 loan)
must strengthen still further the bond between
Britain and Japan lately cemented by a commer-
cial treaty —even though Japan offers to extend
the same commercial privileges to Russia. No
Greek bearing gifts was ever more to be
feared than Russia. She probably looks for
China’s failure to meet her obligations, when,
either by agreement or by force, Russia will
acquire new territory at Chinese expense.
George Higinbotham: Democrat.
Professor Morris, of Melbourne University,
somewhat ambiguously confesses that it had
long been his ambition to write a life of George
Higinbotham. He has achieved his ambition ;
and the life of George Higinbotham will be
composed of all that Prof. Morris has omitted.
For things left undone the Professor will
be entitled to the coining biographer’s thanks.
Apart from ipsa dicta, there is not one bright
spot, not a single quotable passage, not a soli-
tary snappy sentence throughout the book.
Its utmost merit is to contain a certain amount
of journalistic jackal work—prepared food for
the literary lion who will breathe soul into the
story of the Aristides of Australia. It forms
an admirable record of dates, election-polls,
&c., and a handy, though by no means com-
plete, compendium of speeches and documents.
Where and when Higinbotham was born ; who
were his parents, his ancestors and his early
friends; where and with whom he went to
school; how he passed through Dublin Univer-
sity ; how he started life on London Morning
Chronicle ; why, and in what vessel, he went to
Australia, and what he did when he got there ;
when and whom he married, and how he became
a barrister, an editor, a M.P., a responsible
Minister, a plain member again, a simple citizen
lawyer, a Judge, Chief Justice, lecturer, Exhi-
bition President, and strike-sympathiser—such
items are all set down in proper chronological
order, with due and discreet detail. Every-
thing has been said with the greatest propriety
in the meekest and mildest of Morrisese ; and
The Bulletin is glad that none of it is ever
likely to be said again.

When a biographer, who is the son-in-law of
his subject, announces that he has no special
material to work upon, all diaries, letters,
MSS., &c., having been destroyed in accordance
with a testamentary direction, there at least
remains the hope that ana will have been col-
lected and presented in more or less readable
Boswellian style. This hope is gloomily dis-
appointed. There is hardly an item in the
book that has not been published before. Cold
slabs of Hansard and ragouts of newspaper are
mechanically arrayed. Sometimes associates of
the dead Chief are given a show, but generally
they forget to talk about Higinbotham, and
abuse the misguided Prof. Morris’s biblospi-
tality by wandering into egotistical excursions.
Several alleged friends trespass with pointless
anecdotes and irrelevant remarks, and one
throws off a deliberately concocted eulogy.
With the exception of the interesting Higin-
botham letters sent in by his forlorn friend
Richardson these diversions of the main bio-
graphical current are very tiresome ; and several
more or less brief biographies of various unim-
portant persons, and histories of uninteresting
institutions, localities and newspapers, would
have been better left out.
* * *
Among the very few valuable specimens
buried in Prof. Morris’s smoky amber are Higin-
botham’s noble and statesmanlike oration on
his resolutions referring to Victoria’s imperial
relations ; and the simple, yet dynamitic, letter
with which he forwarded the first instalment of
his strike subscriptions to the Trades Hall
Council. These two deliverances are the lofty
measure of Higinbotham’s proportions as a
statesman and a Democrat. It is good that
they should be revived, for it is essential that
they be never forgotten. One is almost startled
to find them in this book of big omissions, and
their presence can only be accounted for by the
circumstance that they could not, with decency,
have been left out. No qualms, however,
preserved the magnificent Brunswick oration of
1874 from suppression. In it were advocated
One Man One Vote, the taxation of Wealth,
and the abolition of the Legislative Council.
Then the steady growth of labor organisations
was traced, and combination was justified
against “that wealth which, when not regulated
by law—when not reduced to terms of equality
with Labor—is, in spite of everything political
economists may say, the most deadly enemy of
Labor.” Finally, the orator prophesied an im-
pending upheaval consequent upon “ the rapid
growth of poverty at one end and of wealth at
the other end of the social scale. ” The ‘ ‘ Science
and Religion ” lecture is noticed, but is slurred
over. No mention is made of the fact that it
condemned “ the representation of God in the
likeness of man,” as “no longer possible in any
shape.” Or, that the lecturer declared “ arbi-
trary dealing, capricious favor, vengeful punish-
ment, sudden passionate change ” to be “ attri-
butes wholly unthinkable in regard to the
Creator.” Or, that he “ finally condemned all
Christian churches alike.” Not a word is hinted
of the “ Strong persecution ” which was the
direct outcome of the deliverance. No comment
is made on the fact that the great thinker
had, in 1883, only brought up to date the
opinions held by him in 1868-9, when he
said, among many other things, that “he
did not believe the religious denominations
in this country had anything to do with
religion;” and that “the Church of England
in all the Australian colonies was unquestion-
ably the most weak, undecided, and incon-
sistent with itself of all of the religious
denominations.” These are a few among many
things which Prof. Morris might have recalled
without in any respect breaking his apparent
rule of only utilising published material.
* * *
Prof. Morris sat down to the manufacture of
his memoir a pedagogue, a fanatic Freetrader,
an Imperial Federationist, an ultra-loyalist, an
inflexible churchman, a bigoted Conservative,
and an Argus contributor. He brought with
him all the prejudice and narrowness of a re-
stricted training, disposition, and environment:
his cherished ideas were Higinbotham’s abom-
ination ; his friends and connections were, or
had been, Higinbotham’s bitterest enemies ;
his sympathies, sentiments, and tastes were
alien to those of his subject; and his offence is
that he has attempted to tincture that giant
with the taints of his own pigmy school, to
belittle his true nobleness, and to dilute his
uncompromising fervor for Democracy. This
Prof. Morris has done to soothe his own vanity,
which every honest thought of Higinbotham’s
must have ruffled ; to avoid offence to his own
friends and patrons ; and, lastly, to spite the
people who have set up Higinbotham as an
idol in their hearts. Such an offence is unfor-
giveable.
• • *
By the exercise of all the insidious arts he
possesses, which are not many, Prof. Morris at-
tempts to tone down Higinbotham’s democratic
character by limning the man as a Freetrader,
an anti-Home Ruler, a loyalist, an anti-imperial
Separatist, and a conservative. As for his
abstract adherence to Freetrade, that is out-
balanced by the concrete fact that but for him
Protection would not have been established in
Victoria so soon as it was. The remarkable
assertion that he was an anti-Home Ruler im-
plies an anomaly in a logical mind which is as
utterly incomprehensible as it is incredible.
But his expressions of loyalty were strictly
official, an empty courtesy paid to an equally
empty form ; and they are outweighed by the
circumstance that he always referred to Eng-
land as a “foreign power,” and to the monarch
as a “foreign potentate.” His position on
Separation was practically, “ Let us retain all
the advantages of formal connection, but recog-
nise no vital obligations on either side. Make
the connection weaker, but vigorously oppose
every movement that would make it stronger.”
On these terms the Jingoes and Freetraders
can have Higinbotham, and get what joy they
can out of the possession.
# # »
Coming to Mr. Morris’s statement that “ his
mind was essentially Conservative,” it is neces-
sary to exhibit Higinbotham with every em-
phasis as he was, the embodiment and exemplar
of every democratic principle. In every rela-
tion between himself and his fellow men, except
in the formalities of ceremonial functions when
he merely represented his office, Higinbotham
embodied the ideal of the republican trilogy :
Libert}', Equality, Fraternity. Moreover, The
Bulletin can produce a hundred extracts from his
utterances to conclusively prove that, through-
out the 40 years which they cover, he was a
consistent Radical. Indeed, item for item, it
can be shown that he, at some time or other,
advocated almost every plank that constitutes
the platform of this paper. Under his editor-
ship the Argus advocated the abolition of
oaths, the abolition of capital punishment,
women’s suffrage, one-man-one-vote, and a
land-tax. His acts were as his principles. He
steadfastly adhered to the principle of payment
of members, although he left his salary in the
Treasury because he did not need it. He was
the declared enemy of Government by Contra-
diction, and a sworn foe to compromise. He
relinquished private legal practice so long as he
drew a salary as Attorney-General. He would
not act as a Minister so long as illegal imperial
instructions to the Governor were tolerated.
He would not accept a Judgeship except on the
understanding that he would not be subject to
any such instructions referring to the Judges.
He refused knighthood. He abhorred the pre-
tensions, the mummeries, and the aristocratic
airs of the vulgar coterie that dubs itself
“Society.” To his judgment in the Ah Toy
case Australia owes the recognition of its right
to exclude aliens. He looked forward to the
time when “ the world would come to having a
class of advocates paid like Judges, by the
State, and not by clients, and that to them
causes would be assigned to conduct fairly.”
His masterly treatment of the Shenandoah case,
in the face of traitorous Tory obstruction, is a
standing lesson to Australian statesmen in
international law. He performed (gratuitously)
the herculean task of consolidating the statutes
that the law might become cheaper and less
confusing to the people. To his guiding
influence, almost directly, Victoria owes the
principles of free, secular and compulsory
education. The second of his famous resolu-
tion on the imperial relations made the Legis-
lative Assembly acknowledge “ the obligation
to provide for the defence of the shores of
Victoria against foreign invasion, by means
furnished at the sole cost, and retained within
the exclusive control of the people of Victoria,”
and this Declaration of Australian Independ-
ence, graven on the records of the House, the
Assembly, in an act of base self-stultification,
under the baleful influence of the Gillies-
Dbakin combination, literally spat upon when
it carried the iniquitous naval subsidy to the
accompaniment of “ God save the Queen.” A
column to the same effect could be written,
exposing in every line the utter fatuousness of
the Tory claim to the great Democrat. But on
the terms here laid down the Conservatives can
again have him, and get what joy they can out
of the possession.
* # #
Higinbotham’s most heroic effort was his
attack on the principle of imperial interference
with Australian affairs ; and the precise effect
that the attack would have had if successful
never seems to have been calmly contemplated.
His aim, still unachieved, was to give Victoria,
and practically Australia, complete independ-
ence in internal Government. The Crown might
appoint a Governor, but there its authority
would end. That Governor should have no dele-
gated duties apart from those indicated by the
Constitution and expounded by his responsible
advisers. If it were necessary—absolutely
essential—to correspond with England, the
correspondence should be conducted directly
between the Premier and the Secretary of State,
just as the Premier of one free foreign country
communicates with the Premier of another.
Had this end been gained, an Australian pro-
vince would have become a peculiarly free and
happy country, combining, as it would, all the
advantages of every enlightened form of govern-
ment, and minimising, or totally discarding,
their defects. It would have been more repub-
lican than a republic, while ensconced in the
mask of a mock monarchy—easily worn, and as
easily doffed. A formal, altogether forceless
figurehead, appointed from afar without popular
friction, maintained without appanage or any
parasitical expense, and freed from the tempta-
tion, because without the power, to favor or to
patronise, would have presided over a Govern-
ment constitutionally embodying the declared
dominant will of the people. Such was his ideal
Democracy. It was never properly understood,
although the Tory gang and the imperial
authorities instinctively and accurately gauged
it as the Prologue to a Republic. The Democrat
used no adventitious arts to realise his design;
his opponents used every means, scrupulous
and unscrupulous, to thwart it. They suc-
ceeded, and having failed in his sublime object,
the sphere of. peddling politics became the
statesman’s only prospect. So he withdrew,
and his ideal Democracy remained a dream.
• # *
Prof. Morris’s memoir is silent upon the
subject of the mean and cruel opposition
that did Governor Darling to death, and
would have rejoiced to have ruined and humili-
ated Higinbotham. The Argus accounts for
this reticence. “ Professor Morris,” it purrs,
“ has too much good taste to revive, more than
is necessary, forgotten feuds.” But the needs
of Democracy demand that they shall never be
forgotten. The Legislative Council, the 22
petitioning Executive Councillors, the Conser-
vative press, the squattocracy, the mercantile
classes, the professions, the banks, and each
traitorous toady whose patriotism had a price,
acted in the battles of the Darling grant just
as they would under similar circumstances act
again. All of these influences had their mouth-
pieces in England. The press commanded un-
limited space in leading English reviews ; the
others had their plaints phonographed by tuft-
hunting absentees at chance interviews with
Secretaries of State in the privity of the Home
office. By these agents the Secretary of State
was treacherously soaked with truthless versions
of the fight, while the local principals did their
share by bullying the Governor, traducing the
Ministry, and sending threats of assassination
to its most violently detested members. The
Argus played its part with a ferocious bril-
liance that it has never since commanded. It
referred to the Cabinet of which Higinbotham
was declared to be the “ dominating influence,”
the “ animating spirit,” as one “ marked with
little variation by deceit, chicane and lawless-
ness ” : it was said to have “ lowered the tone
of political morality,” and its acts were des-
cribed as “illegal, dishonorable and unworthy.”
Higinbotham was a man “ possessed by self-
esteem and pertinacity ” and a “variable and
distempered mind.” His principles were
declared “ revolutionary and impracticable.”
In the English journals its scribes implied that
he was the chief of a crew of thieving cut-throats.
He was accused of “extraordinary arrogance
and violence,” of “despotism,” and “blind
rancour,” while the steps that were taken on
his advice were stigmatised as “a series of
revolutionary crimes.” Opposition members
called him “traitor,” and spoke of his “treason.”
So much was said in the heat of the fray. Only
the vitriolic historian Rusden could have had
the temerity to describe him in cooler after
years as a man “ who would have striven to
carry a point at the cost of disorder and blood-
shed. . . . It seemed that life and property
might be unsafe if Mr. Higinbotham could have
his way.” Such were the estimates formed of
him when he was alive and in the forefront of
the fight. Those who agreed with these things
are naturally grateful because Morris has not
marshalled them forth to stand side by side
with the now reiterated hypocrisies mouthed
two years ago across his open grave.
# # #
This chapter is missing from Prof. Morris’s
memoir. As suggested in the beginning, the Book—
which will be the Bible of Australian Democrats,
just as Higinbotham was the Jesus of Australian
Democracy—will be made up of Prof. Morris’s
omissions. Still, this life has not been written
in vain. The Professor confesses that he dis-
couraged several biographers, among whom The
Bulletin surmises the coming biographer was
probably one, and he has now shot his own
bolt. His work represents exactly how much
the dead Democrat’s family will contribute
towards the telling of the complete story.
It has made the necessity for the whole truth
imperative, for the memory of a great man
awaits a noble vindication. Apparently, Prof.
Morris’s sole qualification for writing this
biography is the fact that he was Higin-
botham’s son-in-law. If the example is to be
generally followed, The Bulletin devoutly
trusts that succeeding sons-in-law will have
worse fathers-in-law, or that succeeding
fathers-in-law will have better biographers.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivery may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Tobv’s Rolled Oats.

night of the “ Gaiety Girl,” and the audience took
to the new form of entertainment very kindly. It
is not distinctly a burlesque, nor an opera, nor a
comedy, nor anything else that is calculated to
supply the police with a clue. There is a faint
shadow of a plot in it, or at least various things
are done, or left undone, which lead to an indis-
tinct impression that the author once intended to
begin to think about putting something of the sort
in it, but never actually got there. To have a
plot it is necessary that people should do some-
thing definite, and when the wicked girl has to
sing various songs and do eight or more dances
while she is on her way to do it she hasn’t time to
arrive. The “ Gaiety Girl ”is rather a spiecies of
indiscriminate dazzle in two beautiful fits. The
performers assume an aspect of seriousness by
wearing their .everyday clothes, which im-
proves things considerably, for a thing that
wouldn’t look funny if done by a girl in
tights seems at least remarkable when per-
petrated by a sedate-looking lady in a long
skirt and a bonnet. Almost every girl in the
show is a separate and distinct dream of love-
liness, and each one is lovelier than all the rest
put together. Miss Madge Rossell’s solo-dance is
about the wildest, prettiest, cleverest thing of its
kind ever seen in Sydney. Miss Grace Palotta is
another vision, who sings a song in which the
public is invited to “take a ’bus,” and gets a tre-
mendous encore. She has also most to do with
constructing the shadowy plot aforementioned,
and here the lamentable fact obtrudes itself like a
bowsprit that the vision can’t act worth a cent.
But, regarded as a vision, Miss Grace is irre-
proachable. She was the first principal to appear
on Saturday night, and when she smiled the house
was undone.
Dainty Decima Moore acts her
little part much better, and sings and
dances admirably. As for the heroine,
Miss Blanche Massey has little to do
save look icily beautiful and languish
under a baseless accusation, and she
languishes in a poetic frock and a hat
which must commend itself to all.
Misses Orossland, Murray and May
Lucas do a high-kick dance which en-
trances every bald beholder ; and the
massive Miss Maud Hobson, repre-
senting a lady with a wicked past
who rashly left her comb on the pre-
mises of the co-respondent, fills her
comedy part well and intelligently. It
is a lamentable fact, however, that
Charles Ryley looks rather heavy and
can’t sing the rousing strain of “Tommy
Atkins ” anything like Arnold used to
sing it. Harry Monk house, the very
large, pale, fat comedian, is probably
the funniest person in the show, and
the mere fact that he represents the
bright Decima’s parent gives him a
claim upon this country’s respectful
consideration. Also, the perky Leed-
ham Bantock, as the judge, comes in a
moderate second.

, The Dacres began their Sydney
season at Her Majesty’s with “Esther
Sandraz,” an eminently artistic play,
with a moral less apparent than it
might be. Its hero, played by Mr.
Dacre, is a nondescript, hard-up man
of fashion, who is intensely in love with
a Portuguese semi-adventuress. Miss
Amy Roselle, in the latter character,
is also hard-up, therefore he throws
her over, and marries a girl with
money. The girl was deeply in love
with another man, who was likewise hard-up,
and he is also thrown over. The husband and
wife lead a respectably miserable life together,
and he spends his spare time writing passionate
love-letters to his lost Portuguese, and asking
her to come. Finally she comes, and won’t go
away again. She is a blight upon him. She
tells him perpetually what a miserable object
he was, and is, and will be as long as he
lives. She reads his love-letters to him, and ex-
plains about his wife’s former engagement, and
breathes horribly into his ear, and whispers
cankering suspicions into his back-hair. She
brings the wife's former lover into the house, and
shows him to the anguished husband from behind
the pot-plant in the doorway, and the husband
rushes out to get his gun. While he is looking for the
gun Scot Inglis, as the lover, grasps the situation
with both hands, and brings the lady to a state of
repentance. He fixes her with his large, grave
eye, and talks to her in a low, monotonous,
musical voice, and apparently she goes off
into a sort of benevolent trance. Just here
the husband comes in and shoots her by
mistake, and later on he blows out his
unsatisfactory brains in the back premises, while
the dying woman is babbling about “ mother ”
the said mother having been a wild creature who
habitually carried firearms.
The husband is a weak, morally-unfinished
person all through. He has no visible character,
and Mr. Dacre probably does all that can be done
with him by endowing him with a lovely mous-
tache and a pair of most poetic legs, and letting
him drift. Miss Amy Roselle hardly looks her
part of the brilliant adventuress in the first act,
but after that, as the black-robed curse which
comes home to roost on the soul of the leggy
betrayer, she is profoundly impressive. Her cold
sneer is a work of genius, and her laugh suggests
an echo from the bottomless pit, and she is
a perfectly lady-like fury dancing on the
stomach of her lost admirer according to
the strictest rules of etiquette. Miss Agnes
Knights is a pleasant nonentity in a white frock,
and Miss Kate Bishop’s fine acting is obscured by
a glaring red costume, like the sun setting behind
meat in a butcher’s shop. Stirling Whyte, as a
funny, bad old man, lends the best support to the
star. The presumable moral of the drama is that
man should marry for love instead of money, and
the said moral is considerably obscured by the
fact that the woman Vandelle married for money
is much nicer than the one he didn’t marry for
love. Moreover, Scot Inglis, the time he has her
fixed with his eye, convinces the latter that she
never loved at all, so there is no moral left.

Rev. Haskett Smith lectures to-night
(Thursday) at Balmain, and on Friday at North
Sydney, and gives a farewell lecture in the city on
Saturday. Whoever wants reliable information
about Palestine, and about the dead hog that
swells to an unnatural size in the stagnant pool of
Siloam, and the thick, green scum which seems to
be everywhere on top of the local water-supply,
and the flies, and the ruins, and other things,
should avail himself of this final opportunity.

The Irish drama at Sydney Royal, which
once looked as if it would out-last time itself, and
be still going on when the earth is hung out like a
fish to dry in the blackened heavens, and the sun
has faded to a pale-green corpse-light, and Parkes’s
last poem is blowing around a frozen universe, is
now actually doing its last nights. It and Maggie
Moore will probably depart together at the end
of next week, or in a month or two, or some years
hence.

About years ago the death of Fred.
Leslie left a great gap in the burlesque show then
running at the London Gaiety, and Louis Brad-
field was the young actor promoted to the vacant
place. The fact that he was subsequently engaged
to undertake Leslie parts on tour speaks for itself.
Manager Edwardes couldn’t find another actor so
well-qualified for the work, and, again, when “The
Gaiety Girl” travelling co. was organised, the
honor of taking over an Arthur Roberts part in
one of their musical comedies fell to the versatile
new man. Mr. Bradfield, critically considered,
lacks distinction of style and stage presence.
Leslie had a valuable figure, fine eyes, and a
flexible, incisive voice. Arthur Roberts, also not-

able for his eyes and voice, is a more strikingly
original “ droll ” than even Leslie. Louis Bradfield
has an ordinary sorb of voice, and an everyday
type of face, and his acting is more or less strongly
suggestive of Leslie when it isn’t very like Roberts.
All the same, Mr. Bradfield is a first-rate enter-
tainer —bright, brisk, amusing and clever at every
point. His “In Town” performance has been
overpraised by the Melb. press, bub that is nob a
surprising circumstance. A sense of proportion
in theatrical matters is not expected of news-
papers, or from the public, who estimate the
excellence of an actor’s ability—always provided
thab he has ability—by the length and breadth of
the character he happens to be filling ab the
moment.

On Saturday last Bland Holt had the
“ pleasing gratification” [vide advt.) of introduc-
ing “The Fatal Card” to Melbourne. He also
had the pleasing gratification of knowing that the
capacious Theatre Royal was not large enough for
the occasion, and of hearing the distant moan of
the populace whose money was refused at the
door. Evidently the populace knew something
about this successful play from Sydney. The
strength of “The Fatal Card” lies in its con-
tempt for melodramatic precedent. To begin with,
the hero has quarrelled with his inflexible parent
and gone abroad ere the curtain ascends, and as
early as the second act he and the villains are
back in London, although nobody expected them
back before 10 o’clock. The murdered corpse lies
weltering in its gore for a longer time than
usual, and the oration delivered in its honor
by the remorseful accessory is quite a novelty
in after-murder speaking. Also, the final
arrest of the chief wrong-doer by two seedy
policemen is dispensed with. An infernal
machine brings “The Fatal Card ” to a sudden
end. The box of ruin explodes with a loud
report, destroying a freehold cottage, together
with the benevolent burglar of the piece, but the
hero’s innocence remains unproven. Indeed, the
good young man seems tolerably certain to get
hanged (for no Judge Windeyer would swallow
his statement of all that has occurred) whilst the
real murderer waxes fat on stolen bonds. There
are many original, or semi-original, situations in
the play, and this last situation is the best of all.
One likes to think the hero dies upon the gallows
for the sake of variety. Walter Baker is, ad-
mittedly, a general favorite. His escapes from un-
just suspicion, through aseries of melodramas, have
been well received, yet it is time for his luck to
take a bad turn. The laws of chance must be
respected, and virtue can’t go on turning up
triumphant for ever. Why shouldn’t Baker hang
occasionally, so that Cosgrove may lurk around
the gaol and fire off his fiendish laugh when the
black flag is hoisted ? Why shouldn’t Mr. O. live
to buy a copy of the evening journal containing a
full account of Baker’s sickening thud, and pre-
sent it to Miss Hilda Spong, saying, “ I’m glad to
see his legs twitched convulsively, ha-ha ! ” The
reward of industry ought to come to a man who
has scored three murders and “several behinds”
—as footballers would say—in the last 10
weeks. Cosgrove works hard in this drama,
whereas Baker is a hero without a purpose.
You find him drinking bad whisky in Colorado,
until one of the barmaids sings “ Be it never so
hura6e(f, there’s no place like Home.” That sends
him off to Hingland. A braver man might have
stopped to face a repetition of the ballad, but
Baker flies immediately. In Hingland he becomes
a mere dude, with strong tendencies to loaf on his
father, a most respectable and mercenary old gen-
tleman. He carries a flash walking-stick, and
with this emblem of indolence the aged relative is
casually slain ; therefore, the blood of his father is
more or less upon Walter Baker’s head. All
things considered, he deserves to be hanged for a
change.
• * *
The mounting of the “ Fatal Card ” is
exceptionally handsome and solid, even for a
Bland Holt show. The dialogue has a literary
backbone, and some of the characters are better
drawn than quartered. Albert Norman, as a
burglar with mixed emotions, would be more satis-
factory if he spoke his long speeches instead of
declaiming them. Miss Yirgie Vivienne needs to
borrow a bigger voice for the evening, and Charles
Brown could do with the loan of a cold, commer-
cial demeanor. Walter Baker, Cosgrove and Miss
Spong are effective in their usual places, but Mr,
and Mrs. Bland Holt have to palm off absurdity
as humor. Nobody, thus far, has been very funny
in a Haddon Chambers play. Haddon’s notions
of comedy are crude, and his collaborateur,
Stephenson, seems to have written a comic scene
for the gallery only.

“An Ideal Husband,” at Melb. Princess’,
has not filled the treasury in accordance with the
promise of its first night. Oscar Wilde’s play
“knocked them” on the Saturday, after which
the supply of enthusiasts began to run short, and
the acting lost a little of its early vigor in conse-
quence. Seeing that a brilliant play by a notorious
author has excited so little interest, there is
reason to fear that B. and B. came along at the
wrong moment. High-class comedy wasn’t loudly
called for, judging from the general appearance
of the dress-circle. Perhaps the last perform-
ance of “An Ideal Husband” will be rushed.
On Saturday (22nd) “The Masqueraders” goes
up for the first time in Melbourne, and Mr.
Arthur Elwood introduces himself to notice.

Miss Ribbentrop’s first appearance at
Melb. Town Hall gave some color to the report
that she possesses a splendid soprano voice, but
the tall and stately damsel of 22 didn’t sing up
to what was expected of Clifford Halle’s re-
presentative pupil. She was very nervous,
and if there is much natural sweetness in her
tones, stage fright certainly spoilt their quality
the other evening. Furthermore, her lower notes
showed the very faults which her tutor holds up
to scorn. Clifford Halle made the errors of his
star soprano the more apparent by singing admir-
ably for his own part, and the concert was a suc-
cess in that it attracted a good crowd of people
who will be disposed to give Miss Ribbentrop
another hearing.

The New Woman raised a row at a Melb. theatre, the
other night, because denied permission to smoke in a box.
A Melb. paper described “The Fatal Card ” as a melo-
drama, by Mr. B. 0. Stephenson and Mr. C. Haddon. O.
Haddonl Australia has produced one successful drama-
tist thus far, and the press of his native country hasn’t
fairly got hold of his name yet.
A new priraa-donna from ’Orae was to have taken over
some of Nellie Stewart’s characters immediately after the
departure of that invaluable favorite. Negotiations fell
through—the n.p.d. couldn’t come. The lamented death
of Miss Violet Varley (with whom the Firm aver that they
never quarrelled all) leaves W. and M. in a rather
awkward predicament.
An incident of the Melb. theatrical carnival. A pretty
damsel dressed in a short, showy frock, who was selling
photos, of star artistes taken in tights, accosted a simple-
looking young curate and asked him to buy a photo, of
Miss Marie Luella dressed in black tights, or “ would he
kindly take one of Miss Palotta in a bathing costume?”
But the poor shepherd was obdurate and yielded not,
though she “ threw her whole soul ” at him.
The impudent and irrepressible Mr. J. R. Rogers,
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent, appeared
to such great disadvantage in the divorce-court, a few
days ago, that no one would accuse him of being “ Yours
Merrily.” Mr. Justice Jeune seemed determined to sift
to the bottom the whole of the suspicious circumstances
connected with his former proceedings against Minnie
Palmer. Sir William Rose, who was the co-respondent
on that occasion, has given evidence and strongly indi-
cated that cash, not freedom from marital chains, was
what Rogers was seeking. George Lewis likewise gave
evidence to the same effect. The giddy old Bart, said that
£5OOO was demanded from him, but eventually some £6OO
was accepted, coupled with the promise (so Rogers says)
that “ a dozen co-respondents ” would be found for him.

The musical critic of a Melbourne morning paper is a
prominent figure at Marshall Hall’s orchestral concerts,
sitting in the front row of the gallery with a tremendous
score of Wagner’s “Tristram ’’ spread out before him on
the rail, following the performance note by note. A rapt
look of critical sagacitv is fixed upon his face, and he
turns over the leaves with much rustling. People who
pose thus and can’t form an impression of the music
without carrying a library about ought to be suppressed.
Hilda Spong leaves Bland Holt and melodrama shortly,
and joins B. & B. at Melb. Princess’s.
Geraldine Olliffe’s Bernhardtesque trick of dropping
her voice from a high, sweet soprano to deep bass when
she wishes to express rage or passion, makes a profound
impression on the Melb. audience. In other respects,
too, she recalls the great Sarah —notably in her gliding,
panther-like stride, and her manner of throwing herself
down in a heap in the corner of a sofa.
The Gaiety people do not find the Australian tour all
joy. On Wednesday, their last day in Adelaide, there
was a “Shop Girl” matinee at 2 p.m., performance at
7.30, and at 11.30 a tedious train journey right through
to Sydney had to be commenced. Altogether, there were
13 performances in Adelaide in 10 days, not counting
rehearsals.
The Gaiety takings for 10 nights in Adelaide are
estimated at £2600, including three matinee perform-
ances. The profit to the “ firm ” is estimated, by one
behind the scenes, at about £BOO.
Decima Moore’s singing voice is liable to go at any
time, as she is a victim to asthma, and cannot sing in
England in winter.
Apparently it pays better now to tame the raging lion
than to draw the raging tooth. At any rate, Arthur
Russell, a Bourke-street (Melb.) dentist, thinks so,
for he is preparing to tour Australia with a cage of
trick lions. The part of Daniel in the lion’s den will bo
undertaken by Miss Florence, a near relative of Arthur
Russell, he himself contributing conjuring and spook
items. Two of Russell’s lions, by the way, are Australian
natives, as also are both Mr. Russell and Miss Florence.

HYoung “Sammy Hayes,” with a dramaticco., including
old-stagers like Jack Hesford, Will South, and Teddy
Haygarth, fills Collingwood (Melb.) Town Hall once a

Carrington’s have both tried to oust “Sammy,” and
failed utterly.
B. and B. in Melb. billed Oscar Wilde’s play, "An
Ideal Husband,” merely as “ by the author of ‘ Lady Win-
dermere’s Fan.’ ” “He who taketh from me my good
name robs me of that which not enricheth him, and
makes me poor indeed.” Shakespeare knew the world.
Young Dorrington took to the stage without having
obtained pa and ma’s consent.
A London paper on a new show : “ Mr. Lonnen, as
usual, was far too exuberant in his restless desire ‘to
keep things moving.’ One wishes that in his fooling,
often excellent as it is, he could add the restraint that is
art to the activity which is nature, or natural.” A
restrained Lonnen, The Bulletin fancies, would be an
unspeakably awful thing. The man has no humor ;he is
merely an indefatigable mummer, who, after working
himself into a profuse perspiration at the outset, must
either keep things moving or catoh cold. By the way,
Hinglish critics had always overlooked the ghastly
exuberance and “ painful activity ” of Lonnen until he
was duly reckoned up in these columns. The same man
was praised sky-high in his own country before he went
to Australia.
At the sale of Oscar Wilde’s furniture and effects his
children’s cast-off clothes, toys, and picture-books were
knocked down at extravagant prices to an old lady who
said she “wasn’t going to let the dealers have the chil-
dren’s things if she could help it.” The dealers ulti-
mately gave her three cheers for being “a good old
sort.”
The play-bill of the future will tell us, besides the name
of the prima donna’s dressmaker, who made the grease-
paint for her lovely complexion, who was the johnny that
gave her the diamonds, and what dentist claims credit
for her fascinating smile.

The first circus in Fiji (Cooper and Bailey’s) took away
such a lot of native money that the Government, it is
averred, won’t let another land there. After O. &B. had
gone away the plantation overseers could not get their
laborers to work properly—they were always attempting
trapeze acts on the trees, &c. Once a Tokelau boy
smashed his leg in attempting one of the circus tricks.
The limb was amputated, and the poor fellow had to
“ stump ” about as a sorb of timekeeper. After his first
appearance with the stump on his plantation, all the
laborers rammed their hoes down one leg of their pants
and stumped about after him. Polynesians take a dif-
ferent view of hard luck.
The United Costermongers’ Society is a live institution

of Kothe, for wounding with intent, the Court sat

about as tired and crabby as men could be. It is
really time that this sort of thing was done away
with. The life of a human being is surely as im-
portant an issue as any which can arise in a
“ goods-sold-and-delivered ” case. The reason
assigned for the long hours is consideration for
the jurors, and desire to avoid the necessity of
locking them up. But why lock juries up at all ?
In all cases of misdemeanor, they are allowed to

for instance—are quite as important as most
felonies.

Vic. Acting-Gov. Madden paid £l2O for
his full major-general’s uniform worn at the
Frankston review, on Queen’s Birthday. A smart
price to pay for an hour’s mock soldiering—
especially as he may never have a chance of wear-
ing it in his present capacity again. After which
grotesque item of bogus glory it is positively
refreshing to read of a dozen or two plain police-
men having replaced the spangled and feathered
military “guard of honor ” at the opening of Ade-
laide Parliament. The democracy’s pattern in
such matters should be President Andrew Jack-
son, who, when he opened Congress, rode up on
his old white horse and hitched it to a post; and,
when he had done his work, unhitched it and rode
away again.

Lady Hopetoun very soon set herself
going after her arrival in London, writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent; and she is
to be s' en almost every day at Egham driving a
team of Shetland ponies. I really believe that
there was no humbug about the “ very young
man’s ” regret at his departure from Victoria, but
I am not sufficiently intimate with the family to
be able to say the same of his wife, who was pro-
bably very glad indeed to get “ home ” again.
“ Montmorganaire Tom Hall and his wife,”
writes a London correspondent to The Bulletin,
“are on a visit to the D’Arcys at Stanmore
before settling down to housekeeping ‘on their
own.’ People are wondering whether Tom will
go in for ‘ sassiety ’ and its consequent expenses,
or simply keep a modest establishment. Rich
men are so scarce now that he would soon become
a society boom if he were to launch out. But
perhaps he may take warning by the fate of
another Melbourne Mount Morgan man, who
spent his cash for a very poor return.”

been born. She went to “In Town,” and her
dress, which was of bottle-green with
cream guipure and puffed sleeves, or something
like that, was the envy of the circle. All went
well until someone made an extra funny gag.
The lady leaned forward and laughed consumedly,
and just there the bottle-green dress split down
the front and—exit.

A Spencer-st. station (Melb.) railway
official got into trouble about the departure of
the “Gaiety Girl”co. The amorous man took
off his uniform cap, put on a silk hat, and hurried
to the place where all the farewell kissing was
going on to get his share. He got it—but there
was nothing about kissing passengers in his list of
duties, and he was called upon to explain. A
departmental reprimand was considered sufficient
to meet the case, under the exceptionally tempting
circumstances.

Varasemai, the Kanaka murderer, lately
executed in Brisbane Gaol, was a “ walk-about. ”
The “walk-about” Polynesian is becoming a
serious danger. He is the terror of women and
shop-girls who meet him of an evening; he
organises intertribal fights and often makes the
streets impassable. His morals are unspeakable,
and he often pays the police-court fines of women
of ill-fame. It is proposed in Bananaland to
limit by law the time he may remain unemployed;
also, to stop Kanakas coming into town on Satur-
day evening and making Sunday a heathen orgie.
By the way, how far is an islander, whose liberty
is thus curtailed, removed from a slave?

According to Bundaberg Star, when
kanakas sight a bandicoot they all immediately
give chase. When the unlucky marsupial has
been killed by one of their number, the others
each walk up and (in accordance with some island
superstion) gives the defunct animal a blow. The
Star suggests that this circumstance may throw
some light on the fact that when the unfortunate
Macartney was struck down and killed by the
foremost Polynesian assailant the others each
advanced and then gave the body a blow.

Dear Bulletin, — Melb. waxworks-man
Kreitmayer has an affecting story of wifely devo-
tion. A gentleman had been hanged, and Kreity
took a cast of him, and duly placed the figure,
dressed in his actual cldthes, among the horrors.
One day a little woman visited the show, and
identified the figure. “ It’s ’im ! ” she said, sob-
bing semi-colons; “it’s ’im ! ” The attendant
asked her if she had known the original, and the
little woman answered that the original had been
her husband until his little trouble with the
police. “ However he could a-come to do it, an’
me keepin’ ’im so neat and clean, I don’t know,”
the widow continued. “ An' that’s a fearful dirty
shirt Vs got on now—would you let me put a
clean shirt on ’im once or twice ter week ?” She
was referred to Kreitmayer, secured his consent,
and for months after that the widow visited the
show twice a week and changed the corpse’s shirt.
It was her way of putting flowers on his grave.
(There is some pathos concealed hereabout.) But
after a year the visits stopped. She was “ doing
up’’the shirts of “another bloke.” —The Reck-

Miss Marguerite Ribbentrop, a di-

22nd year, has come to Australia, accom-
panied by her father, to sing at the Halle
concerts. Her voice is said to be of beauti-

the young lady understands “sing-
ing as an art.” It is claimed for Miss
Ribbentrop that her rifle-shooting is almost
as fine as her high notes. Mr. Ribbentrop

These things are certain ; (1) That the
public was utterly dissatisfied not only with the
conduct of the Dean trial, but with the evidence on
which the man was found guilty. (2) That public
dissatisfaction at the verdict has been largely in-
creased instead of diminished by the further evi-
dence taken before the Commission. (3) That if
George Reid does not let George Dean out of gaol
George Dean will be the means of helping George
Reid out of office.
When a publican is suspected of keeping adul-
terated grog for sale the licensing-inspector goes
to his hotel, buys a sample of liquor, and divides
same into two portions. These are sealed up in
two bottles, one of which is retained by the publi-
can while the other is kept for official analysis.
Thus is secured the genuineness of the sample
submitted for examination. Now, in the Dean
case, the fluids handed to the analyst could ad-
mittedly have been tampered with by certainly
six or seven, and, possibly, by sixty or seventy,
people. Thus, evidence which would by law have
been utterly valueless as against a publican liable
to a mere <£2o fine, is considered good enough to
condemn and hang a man of good character.
“But,” it will be argued by those who believe
in upholding the Supreme Court, even should a
lunacy- warrant be out for it, “ look at all the
other circumstances.” Circumstantial evidence is
worth nothing unless every link be perfect. In
the Dean case there are twenty rotten links.

The extreme of burlesque was reached by
Salomons, Q.C., in bringing witness after witness

Seymour. The late lamented Frederick Bailey
Deeming could have furnished sheaves of testi-
monials to a similar purport. The testimony of
one reliable citizen who does know something,

don’t. The affirmative is at least a unit; the

Pegg.” To “Pegg,” “Rita” confided her love
for Frank, and owned that she had also written a
“ heart-rendering ” letter to another of her “old
boys.” But the cream of “Rita’s” resurrected
manuscript is in its advice, and in the home-
photograph it gives :
Oh l George, never fall in love, it is very bad for the
constitution. . . . Please bring some kiss-papers, and
give Frank a kiss for me, as I have not had the pleasure
of giving him one for myself.
Had his guardian angel given another George
prophetic warning, it might have whispered—
“Oh! George, never fall into matrimony; it’s
bad for the neck.”
However, there’s the idyllic picture. Thus and
thus did the infantile Mary Seymour make love.
Thus and thus did she prattle to her “ old boys,”
and Cupid shot darts and bore roses with im-
partial willingness. Imagination now cranes her
neck and calls for another photograph or two from

One medical question arising out of the
Dean alleged-poisoning case is : Does skin-pig-
mentation follow on acute arsenical poisoning,
or can it only arise from chronic poisoning?
That is bo say, is it reasonable to anticipate skin-
pigmentation from one or two big isolated doses,
or can you only look for it after “slow” absorption
of many small doses? On an authoritative answer
to this much would depend, as the Crown theory,
generally believed to be wrong, is that pigmenta-
tion followed on one or two almost-fatal doses.
* • *
A side-light on the Dean alleged-poisoning
case is the close friendship of one of the women
concerned with a lady nob unconnected with the
police.
* * *
One of the most humorous circumstances
of the Dean Commission was the testimonial given
to Mrs. Seymour’s honesty by her landlord, Mr.
George Withers, the first item in whose catalogue
of his tenant’s virtues was that the charming old
lady “always paid her rent regularly.” Why on
earth didn’t he add, “and never asked for
repairs.”

himself for science’ sake by taking arsenic

A story the Countess Wachtmeister,
now lecturing in Melbourne, tells about H. P,
Blavatsky, illustrates the blind credulity with
which that old lady’s alleged miracles and
“ psychometrisings” have been accepted. Once,
when staying with Blavatsky, she (the Coun-
tess) was asked by her to hand her a book she
had in her trunk. “I have no books with
me,” said the Countess. “ Think again,” said
Blavatsky, “Master says he told you to bring
me a book on the Tarot and the Kabbalah.”
She looked in her trunk and found she had
the book at the bottom of it. When she was
about to hand it over, Blavatsky said, “Turn
bo page 10, and on the sixth line you will
read. . .” and she quoted a passage. The
Countess gives this story as a proof of
“H.P.B.’s” miraculous powers! An ordi-
nary sane person would have at once said,
“Why on earth have you been fumbling in
my trunk?” But Blavatsky told her “Master”
gave the information, and she believed it!

My Dear Moorabinda—
The German Club, in Phillip-street(by the w y,
Germans must make either very sober or very
fatalistic clubmen, to have their front steps lead-
ing on to a tram-line ! —English clubmen don’t
take such risks, but choose sequestered urban
spots, with a cab-rank in the middle distance) was
all agog the other evening when Frau Buhrow,
sometimes assisted and sometimes hindered by an
amateur co., gave “The World of Boredom ” for
the benefit of something or somebody with an
unpronounceable Deutscher name, which could only
be rightly rendered by a Nitouche sneeze. “ The
World,” &c., is no fledgling in amateur dramatic
circles, for it has been played several times
already, but still it went like a shot the other
evening before a Continental sorb of audience —
women with flowers hanging in their love-looks at
an utterly impossible (English) angle, and German
naval officers, all gold buttons and spectacles. It
was mostly a full-dress gathering. Indeed, I
wondered at the display of shoulder and skirt,
until somebody arose near the curtain and re-
marked that the evening would end in a dance.
Mine. Buhrow (an actress of many laurels in the
old world) played Suzanne in a most natural way.
In a couple of virginal white frocks and her hair
down, the gifted Vrow rang the changes on every
conceivable human emotion in pretty broken-
English, which manifestly helped the plot. Even
a tiny stage—about the right size for a self-
respecting Punch-and-Judy show—by no means
handsomely arranged (fancy a countess having the
walls of her morning room trimmed with jamias,
like a butcher’s shop at Xmas !) couldn’t spoil
the artistic effect of Frau Buhrow’s finished his-
trionics. She even minimised the fatal effects of
some of her supporters, one of whom (the Coun-
tess) struck angular attitudes with a fan, suggestive
of Japanese stained glass. Another (the Duchess)
acted easily—quite as easily as she forgot her
part; and a pink-robed maiden with her bodice
off one shoulder only (is this a new dodge, I
wonder ?) went through all the wriggling motions
you see in a hooked fish on its way from the deep
to the dingey, every time she had anything to do.
People who really assisted the one-part perform-
ance were Mr. A. J. Kelynack, who looked like
Arthur Lawrence at any rate, bub only had to
stand about intelligently and let the star hug
him ; Mr. G. M'Mahon, as the Professor, got up
like Lardelli ; and Miss Duleie Wilton, as the
frozen English miss-only she shouldn’t have
worn a white gown. Two white frocks on a stage
the size of a pocket-handkerchief made it look like
a confirmation-service. By the way, a new and
neat way of inviting your adored to a tete-k-tete
is introduced into the World of Boredom. “Let
us isolate ourselves to exchange thought 1” said
the Professor. One could imagine oneself break-
ing every one of the Ten Commandments if the
stimulus were always so discreetly given.
Another amusing little nocturnal outbreak last
week was the Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society’s
musical welcome to Signor Hazon, who pays Aus-
tralia the compliment of returning much earlier
than people expected. The Signor has come back
in splendid form, looking fib to wave two batons if
necessary, and expresses himself delighted with
the progress of the S.A.O.S. under Rivers All-
press. Signora Hazon was there, too, in a very
fluffy blue blouse of tulle and satin and a black
silk skirt, and Master Mario Hazon was also a
guest of the evening, which was given over to
music tempered with light refreshments.
The Hazon reunion was really a concert in curl-
papers. It opened with a dress-rehearsal (not a
performance) of a Beethoven bit by the clever
amateur society headed by Mr, Allpress. A new
tenor, Mr. Weir (just now from Maoriland) sang
“ Stars ” very tenderly with delicate pianissimo
most unusual in a man’s voice ; bub the treat of
the evening was a Grieg concerto (Rivers Allpress
and Miss Hyam) which was really high art, and
made itself felt despite the general excellence of the
programme. Said programme was assisted by Miss
Nellie Young, Miss Colborne-Baber, Miss Evelyn,
Miss Sheridan Reed, Dr. Laure and other warb-
lers of note.
Nellie Stewart’s Pickwickian ben. (she gave all
the money away in charity), at Sydney Lyceum
last Wednesday, drew a full house, bub owing to
its being mostly packed by the matinee-
woman, in her big sprouting hat, the applause
was very cool. I think the reason why women
lon’t clap (apart from glove-considerations) is
because they don’t want to applaud the women,
and they aren’t honest enough to barrack for the
men. “Ma Mie Rosette ” was the matinee card,
with Nellie in the white night-dress of perfect
stage innocence, and Mr. Brownlow as the un-
speakable Henri, in the exquisitely-fitting black
tights of rest of the cast being the mix-
ture as before. The opera went splendidly, but
owing, I suppose, to the hen-house state of things
ln -i ii° *^ le golden-haired beneficiary was very
mildly bouqueted—flowers have been very shy all
through the comic-opera season. At the call after
the last curtain Nellie came forward, in the pink
chemise of the last scene, and said, in a small,
fluttering voice that the children of Sydney would
benefit to the extent of ,£2OO, thank you, and
then the fleeting show was o’er.
Looking at the radiant first appearance of the
Gaiety girls (their own abbreviation, the “ Gee-
Gees, ’ is likely to find favor in Australia) at
Sydney Lyceum, even from the bilious point of
view of the morning afterwards, there still appear
j? e ver y f ew flies in the amber. There was lots
of fiitor o in front before the curtain rose, though
I don’t count the big crowd outside the doors as
any great test of public enthusiasm. Inside the
theatre, things were very topsy-turvy, the regular
first-nighters (with the exception of one or two)
being scattered to the four winds out of their
accustomed niches. Nellie Stewart, in a black
silk dress, with the sleeves off the shoulder, and
■ a -v!r onc D here, there, and everywhere, scintillated
in Mr. Musgrove’s stage-box, but it was not what
the society-reporters would call a “ brilliant
assemblage ’’ —the percentage of sadly-plumaged
male birds out for to see “on their very own”
was too great. Black coats sopped up all the
brilliancy, though, as most of the youths were
elaborately button-holed, you must confess they
did their best to look festive, poor things. It was
a very noisy premiere. Before the curtain rose,
the how-de-do among the gods left the Zoo at
a bad second.
The primest portions of the Gaiety wardrobe
are emptied all oyer that majestic, luscious, if
somewhat over-painted edition de luxe of a
woman, Maud Hobson, whose one weakness seems
to be always having something to carry—parasol,
fan, stick, bouquet—she never walks on without
some weapon to cling to. Maud (who is more
spectacular than histrionic, with a singing voice
absurdly top small for her bulk and style) sports
three clinking sets of harness and a tiger, so to
speak, in the shape of a be-ruffled cream-muslin
bathing-gown cut with a great snip up above bub
more generously proportioned below (like the
lady’s calves), but her best “pinney”—the one
she’s had her picture taken in—was worn in the
last act. A white-satin Direotoire gown with
immense sleeves over a petticoat of gold em-
broidery with a foot-flounce of silver-spangled-
white chiffon. Brown fur occurs in the recipe, too
and roses; likewise, a big white hat drowned in
white feathers and modulated with dark-velvet
bows, roses and paste. A posy of yellow flowers
tied with yellow ribbons completed the picture.
Maud certainly is the clothes-horse of the “ Gee
Gees,” and evidently scouts the beauty-unadorned
idea. Her first dress of pale-blue and strawberry-
ribbon brocade with a blue-chiffon bodice of
golden tissue, finished off by a startled-looking-
toque in pink and blue and a pinky parasol, is
almost sure to be duplicated at next Melb. Cup,
and her Riviera toilet (which she dons merely to
take one turn round the stage in) delicately-tinted
brocade once more, with a sort of king’s crown in
stage diamonds in her hat, elicited gasps of horror
from married men in front. Miss Hobson cer-
tainly does open up the sartorial country before
the average Australienne, whose greatest extrava-
gance up to now has been to be “ really tailor-
made ” in a very expensive frock, but one which
she makes last her practically foy ever. Maud’s
dressing is of the butterfly breed—here to-day and
gone to-morrow, though the milliner’s bill re-
maineth.
Blanche Massey dressed to suit her water-name
—all in white both acts. Perhaps the white satin
tea-gown with cascades of old-looking lace was
Blanche’s supreme effort, though such an un-
earthly garment hardly comes within the range of
criticism, it seems to me. Miss Massey in busi-
ness hours has an angelic expression that seems to
demand an apotheosis with wadding seraphs in
the last act, and a voice like Bessie Rignold’s, but
I do wish she wouldn’t hang her head after the
fashion of a dislocated snowdrop. Tiny Decima
Moore (the prima-donna of the co.) contented
herself with a pinkish frock and floral hat (a neat,
but rather suburban-looking rig), a bewitching
blue bathing-suit (the bathing in a “ Gaiety Girl ”
reminds me of the person who hung his clothes on
a gooseberry-bush but never went near the water),
and a pink-and-green carnival frock which was not
meant to be taken seriously. Miss Decima Moore
doesn’t depend on furbelows, for she has a chirrupy
little voice of her own, and her dancing is a treat.
Not like the dreamy twistings of Madge Rossell
in a grasshopper-green gown trimmed with little
bunches of violets—but the livelier sort of heel-
and-toeing which relies for effect on a foam of lace
petticoats and tiny bronze shoes. The Gaiety
dancing is more than lively—it’s furious. The
wild carnival dance, for example, which ends with
Louis Bradfield (he is good-looking, with a crisp
singing voice, and means to become a favorite, I
can see) carrying Decima Moore off the stage in
his arms, is more like a Walpurgis episode than a
modern show.
Pretty, piquant Grace Palotta’s frocks, as the
wicked French maid, wouldn’t amount to much in
an inventory, but their effect was charming, like
her magnetic personality and her fresh, youthful
voice. By the way, Charles Ryley, the stage
masher par excellence of yore (sixmonths is “yore”
on the stage, you know), turned up again in the
“ Gaiety Girl,” and, though the house received
him with warm approval, Miss Palotta’s
“ Sharley ” had not the chance of the Charley of
the past. His voice keeps a good edge on it, but
he sang the trivial, rattling “Tommy Atkins”
song with as much slow, romantic fervor as
though that pipeclay hero was “Queen of My
Heart,” and the complete success of his re-appear-
ance was sadly handicapped by his costume. The
marvellously shapely Ryley, in the ordinary
trousers of every-day life, looks a much more com-
monplace person than the Ryley who flung his
unveiled, classic shanks at the dress circle, as
Guiseppe, in the merry gondoliers. I regret to
hear that “ Sharley ” is struggling against a severe
illness.
I think the mystery of the performance (a verit-
able dramatic souffle which you enjoy best with-
out brain-sauce) is Monkhouse’s silk hat. That
supernaturally shiny erection is made a football
0 f and subjected to most inconsiderate treatment,
and yet it comes out of the ordeal respectable
enough to go to church in. There was a good
show of vegetables on the first night, and one of
the principals (I don’t say which) received a lovely
posy of flowers, as usual, from some faithful
adorer, who ;has regularly be-flowered the
beauteous being in every ’Stralian city. People
who know all about it say it’s quite a romance,
I cannot say whether the dance at Nithsdale
last Friday evening in aid of the piano-fund of the
Children’s Hospital was a financial success or not,
for nobody seemed to have any idea how the
figures would go, but it went off very merrily
socially. Mrs. Lamb, prime mover in the affair,
wore cream satin and lace with good effect, but I
am sorry to say her pretty gown was not one of
many. The idea seemed to be chemist-shop colors,
and if you were pink you were pink to your finger-
nails, and if you were blue you were blue down to
the heels, and no mistake about it. A stout lady
wisely wore black, though perhaps she was over-
garlanded with violets, and another welter-weight
had foolishly stuffed herself into white satin, in
which she looked like an under-study to a feather
bolster. The supper-table was prettily set.
Talking of dances reminds me that the steam-
ship-companies’ ball, with Mr. T, R. Allt on deck, is
to happen at Paddington Town Hall on the 28th
inst., and promises to improve on its former, suc-
cess ; that the Tempe ball committee people are
working like ants in the good cause, and that the
Factory Club ball, under the aegis of Mrs.
Douglas Mackenzie, is also “bucking up,” as
they say in the “ Gaiety Girl.”
Miss Amy Roselle (Mrs. Arthur Dacre) opened
at Sydney Her Majesty’s last Friday evening in
the tragedy “ Esther Sandraz ” to a dress-circle
peppered with society faces. Miss Roselle is not
an actress who relies on the contents of her Sara-
toga to pull her through. In “ Esther Sandraz ”
the dressing is as simple as possible. Barring
the first-act white satin, softened with lace and
gleaming with jewels, a black silk frock,
with a little jet, is all the dressmaker has to do
with it. Miss Roselle is a fine flesh-and-blood
actress, who carries her head well up, like a game
steeplechaser, and is always mistress of the situa-
tion ; judging by the bouquets she received on her
Sydney debut, a good many people approve of her,
too. Hubby Arthur Dacre looks like the Family
Herald idea of a duke. I have never seen a
nearer approach to the long nether supports of
that marvellous hero of fiction than Mr. D.’s legs,
which look as if they would give a good account
of themselves in tights; and his moustache is
certainly the most carefully-trained and well-
behaved rnustivvy at present appearing on the
’Stralian stage. Both Mr. and Mrs. Dacre were
called after each curtain, and it was charming
to see Mr. D. patting Mrs. D.’s hand, and letting
her absorb all the praise, as a model histrionic
husband should.

The COUNTESS WACHTMEISTER,
Theosophical Apostle.
Her Majesty’s dramatic co. supports Miss
Roselle; and Miss Agnes Knights, as the wife,
wore a very stylish primrose tea-gown, trimmed
with brown fur, but I do object to the way she
arranges her hair. In Sydney, the other day, a
bookmaker strove to get out of paying a hair-
dressing account of his wife’s, as he did not con-
sider a careful coiffure “one of the necessaries of
life.” Miss Knights evidently shares the bookie’s
opinion, for her wild touzle d la tea-pot might
have been arranged with a stable-fork. The only
fault I found with Miss Kate Bishop’s Mephisto-
phelian walking-dress was that it was worn in the
wrong act, when the surrounding colors were
antagonistic.
Private letters received from Miss “ Heather
Waltz ” Fitz-Stubbs say that the trip ’Ome in the
Ophir was as pretty as a painted voyage. Miss
Fitz-Stubbs was, of course, elected final authority
of the musical programme for the voyage, and
arranged several tip-top concerts, also minstrel
shows, with victorious-cricketer Stoddart as bones
and Brockwell as tambo. On arrival at Tilbury
Docks a purse of sovereigns was presented to Miss
Fitz-Stubbs in token of the gratitude of the pas-
sengers for being so entertained en route, and the
voyage, I am glad to say, generally wound up
with three cheers for the clever Australian com-
poser.
A feature of Sydney Lyceum d.c. is the
chameleonic propensities of some of the d.c.
boutonnieres (masculine). I was sitting near a
youth and maiden the other evening and particu-
larly noticed the little bunch of red berries and
moss which adorned his coat-collar. So when he
returned, after an interval absence, proudly wear-
ing a broken-necked rosebud, which looked as if
somebody had poked his pipe with it, backed up
by a debilitated leaf or so (self-proclaimed spoils
from a barmaid’s peroxidised back hair), I couldn’t
help glancing at his lady companion out of the
tail of my eye to see how she took it. She didn’t
seem to notice —but if I went to the play with my
pet Johnnie and he didn’t cling to his sunflower,
or whatever it was, throughout the evening I
think I would feel distinctly de trap.
While on the subject of coat-flowers, can any-
body tell me if it’s one of the unwritten laws for
a woman to admire a man’s boutonniere, unless
she means she wants it ? Etiquette is such a will-
o’-the-wisp that really one never knows. I was
told, for example, the other day, that the
style of both men uncovering when only
one knows the passing lady is not by any
means universal in Hingland, whence we get
all our most amusing manners, including
turned-up trousers in a drought and the wallaby-
track walk. The up-to-date youth doesn’t bare
his bald —no, I_ mean bold—brow unless he also,
knows the “gairl,” and, I rnusc say, I like the
new arrangement. I have sometimes nodded to
one youth in a company of five strange men, and
the old-fashioned flourish of toppings-off looked as
if I was the daughter of the regiment. By the
way, some men who don’t know their friend’s fair
friend have a shockingly bad trick of turning
round and scrutinising her, as if she were—well,
somebody she shouldn’t be, and they were sizing
her up on her points. And only because the poor
woman has smiled and bowed to their chum, and
they don’t happen to know her! Why, they
couldn’t behave more badly if she had winked at
them.
But this doesn’t answer my question about
admiring a man’s flowers. Every man one does it
to suddenly and mechanically hands ’em over to
one so regularly that it’s almost as paying as say-
ing “ philopoena ’’ first and things like that. So,
until I know, I am nob going to admire any more
sixpenny floral effects. It is evidently a most
misunderstood art.
. I heard the other day a little story concern*
mg a doubtless forgotten episode in the life of
a politician named George. He was at a small
party one evening, and in the palpitating ob-
scurity of a dark verandah-corner he nestled closer
to the elbow of his last waltz-partner, and asked
her, in tender tones, not to “ Mister ” him, but to
call him George. So she did, but spoilt the true
inwardness of the situation by pronouncing it
briskly, “Gorge.” “Oh, don’t say Gorge, so
sharply,” said the politician-to-be—“say it with
sentiment, G-E-O-R-G-B !” ending with a gram-
pus-hke groan. To this day that girl and her
friends always call him GEORGE with a senti-
mental insucking of the breath.
Now that the whole of play-going Australia
seems inclined to wildly and blindly worship a
bevy of beauteous Thespiennes who have come
amongst us_ like falling stars, I want to rise and
remind the johnnies (who in the new frenzy may
be inclined to think every woman in tights an
angel unfledged) that three lovely damsels whom
all Australia worshipped not seven years ago,
were turned out of their hotel in one Australian
city for creating a disturbance. It wasn’t a
champagne-and-oyster disturbance, either, but a
vulgar, unpoetic orgy based on sordid victuals—
including pickles. The actress is almost always
disenchanting off the stage, and a cure for the
love-stricken Johnnie is for him to steadfastly
remember that the adorable vision is very fond of
onions and drinks quarts of beer at supper.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I have received a
copy of the “Katherine” waltz, based on three
airs from Signor Lardelli’s opera of that name. It
strikes me that the “ Katherine ” (which is pretty
and danceable) is just a little too previous to be a
great success yet awhile. There is no true in-
wardness in a waltz on an opera nobody as yet
whistles ; but, doubtless, when the opera is known
the waltz will have its little innings.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Romano’s restaurant in the Strand,
London, lately destroyed by fire, has been rebuilt,
and re-opened with a superb inaugural dinner.
Australians visiting London should take note of
this as being one of the few places in London
where something like good cookery can be had.
That veteran host, Tom Asche, late of the

liest, handsomest hostelries in Sydney.
Half-a-dozen poor aborigines at Fern-
mount (N.S.W.) were fatally poisoned through
drinking a presentation bottle of what was thought
to be “overproof rum.” The presenter, of the
potheenic name of Kelly, declared that he believed
it to be that beverage; “ Indade, Oi tuk a shwig
raesilf, an’ Oi shpose that’s what Oi’m sufferin’
from now.” Faith, no. The Kelly is suffering
from an “ Irish constitution ” :
Countess Wachtmeister, widow of a
Swedish ambassador, who is just now rounding
up the meek and trusty Blavatskyites of Melb.,
and of whom an excellent photo, by Talma, is
here printed, is an intensely serious person, with
a hard and smileless visage, and hair brushed
vigorously back from a wide expanse of brow.
She is reputed to have been one of the gayest of
persons at European courts, in her halcyon days.
Now she appears to have spent her life in
prayer and fasting. She makes up as well as
Annie Besant, though plumper of figure than
that lady. She dons Annie’s grey tea-gown
garb, clasps her hands midships, Annie-wise,
and follows the Annie oratorical plan of enun-
ciating nearly every syllable with a snap. The
similarity ends there. Annie Besant is an
easy person to imitate—if one has her wonder-
ful mind, her personal magnetism, and her
matchless gift of the gab, which Countess Wacht-
meister hasn’t, and never will have with any
amount of trying.
Six begging niggers hither come,
And rum is heaven, and heaven is rum,
And virtue is a vice.
And, lo 1 they get from generous hand
A bottle of mysterious brand,
And drink it in a trice.
The drug was heaven, though ’twasn’t rum,
It sent ’em all to Kingdom Come—
Perpetual Paradise !

“Jackey, who am I?’
“Oh,” said Jackey,

Some years ago
Maloney, M.L.A., the
little Radical Vic.
medico, met Davitt in
Michael’s native Ros-
common. There was a
row on, and Maloney
was in the thick thereof.
Davitt’s bhoys were
smaller in numbers than
the others, and made a
masterly retreat under
a shower of stones.
Little Maloney told
Miohael he hadn’t come
all the way from Mel-
bourne to be stoned by
a mob of bailiffs and
bog-trotters. “Here’s
ammunition,” sez the
little man, pointing to
21b. granite boulders
that smiled on the road-
side. But Davitt knew
better. He had got 15
years p.s. as a Fenian
arms-agent, and wasn’t
going to play the school-
boy and be run in for a
mere breach of the
peace, so he got hold of
Maloney from Mel-
bourne under his only
arm and took him to
the nearest priest’s
house, where he was
safely chained to a de-
canter while the storm
blew over.
Already it has been announced that Lady
Carington will be presented “on the birth of an
heir,” and altogether the arrival of young Mr.
Smith has assumed the dimensions of a State
Affair of Importance.
David Syme’s youngest son is now on the
reporting staff of the Age, and has just begun to
try his hand in the Parliamentary gallery. Like
the monarchy, the post of boss-bully of Victorian
Liberalism is to be hereditary.
An Australian Judge addicted to spiritual-
ism was, in his barristerial days, no less imbued
with the craze for the quasi-marvellous. He has
never forgiven the learned counsel who so success-
fully conspired to hoax him with the usual grue-
some figure constructed per aid of sheets, flour
and phosphorus.
J. F. Hogan is alleged by Melb. Herald
(in a leading article) to have said that it, the
Herald, is “ the smartest paper in the world.”
It ought to be the smartest paper in the world,
considering that Hogan is a paid London con-
tributor to its columns.
A nun in the convent at Abbotsford
(Melb.), which is within 50 yards of the tramline,
last week saw a tramcar for the first time in her
life, though she has been in the convent for nearly
20 years. During all that time she had never
been outside the building.
The famous Parkes £lO,OOO testimonial
of a few years ago is commonly believed to have
been invested in bank shares at boom prices; it
now yields about 2 per cent, interest and would
realise about £4OOO if sold out. Parkes’s financial
ill-luck is something awful.
It was solicitor “ Jim ” Moloney, of Mel-
bourne, who killed Rufus Dawes, in Marcus
Clarke’s novel. The author originally made Dawes
return to England, and “live happily” in the
good, old orthodox way ; but Moloney fortunately
persuaded Clarke to alter this.
Gov. Brassey, an insatiable reader, marks
in the margin of every volume the most striking
passages. Then he has the marked portions type-
written on uniform-sized paper, which extracts
are classified and pigeon-holed for ready reference.
He has pursued this plan all his life.
The retirement of “Nosey Bob” having
been rumored lately, over 100 candidates made
application for the post of N.S.W. executioner.
Among them was a Chinaman, who thoughtfully
forwarded his naturalisation-paper, to show that
he was allee same as other Blitish gentlemen.
Henry Irving, Walter Besant, and that
crawlsome Lewis Morris, are reckoned by Queen
Victoria worthy only of the K. 8., the lowest
order of knighthood extant. For some years
prior to the Vic. land-boom era the K.B. had lain
torpid, and it was apparently resurrected by Gov.
Loch as a means of ennobbling Benjamin Ben-
jamin without quite placing that obese potentate
on a par with the K.’sO.M.G. of the province.
What a satire on the whole system of titles:
Henry Irving, Walter Besant, and Bingy Bingy !
It was an open secret amongst Gov.
William Robinson’s Melb. friends that he would
not return to Westralia, if he could help it. He
had received a hint from the local Mrs. Grundy
that he was not tq return without bis wife, and he
himself knew that this was easier promised than
performed. Then he went to London, hungering
to get his opera-play produced. It turned out
that “Predatoros” bore a striking likeness to
“The Chieftain,” running at the Savoy, and so
he has to wait. Better be an Agent-General
within reach of theatre managers than a Governor
without.

“ A lone Victorian lady, who informed the police that a gentlemanly
young man, supposed to be a lunatic, broke into her house at midnight and
threatened to take her life unless she married him , has now admitted that
the alleged incident never happened and was merely a nightmare. A craw-
fish-supper, indulged in on the previous evening, is supposed to be the cause
of all the trouble.” — NEWS ITEM.
Miss ONTHESHELF (of St. Kilda): “ Kindly supply me with a crawfish,
and I think you may give me the largest you've got."
Vic. Chief Justice Madden’s love of horse-
flesh is no new trait in his character. When a
boy of 10 he resided in Moonee Ponds (Vic.), and,
according to a compact made between him and
one Hatton, a local batcher, young Madden used
to turn up at the latter’s stable every night and
put in an hour or so grooming the meat-man’s
mokes, receiving as compensation the loan of the
best nag in the stalls each Saturday and Sunday
afternoon. Hatton is living yet; and the weather-
board shop, at the rear of which the C.J.
“ whooshed ” his smoking prads, still stands in the
football township.
Lady Carington had been 17 years married
before she added a son and heir to her long family
of girls. Queen Victoria is said to have dropped a
silent tear upon Oarington’s gold lace when she
congratulated him on the arrival of the baby boy.

Apropos Salmon Wilson, just deceased. An
anecdote may be revived of him and M'Ooll, the
luckless projector of theGoulburn irrigation scheme,
the prophet of all the Ghaffeys and Milduras. At
Melb. White Hart Hotel, Mac. tried to persuade
Salmon. “Where will the people come from?”
asked Salmon. “ Where do the flies come from? ”
asked M‘Coll, dropping a pinch of sugar on the
table.
The brief of Salomons, Q.C., before the
Dean Commission was marked at 50 guineas a
day. Pilcher, Q.C., was guaranteed 15 guineas a
day—it is possible he may have received more—
although he ordinarily receives fees as high as
those of his perky opponent. Mr. Pilcher in-
timated to the Dean defence committee that he
accepted the brief more because of personal sym-
pathy than anything else.
Salmon Wilson’s death in England sur-
prised many people, who thought he was in Aus-
tralia. That monstrous white elephant, Wilson
Hall, a monument of pride, vanity, and folly, at
Melb. University, remains as his memorial of the
.£30,000 he paid for his title. The ridiculous fea-
ture of the place is that it is a useless appendage
to the tumble-down buildings, where the money
would have been really useful.
Dear Bulletin, —I am tired of hearing
people and seeing papers expatiate upon Parkes’
wonderful staying powers, and pointing him out
at the adult prodigy of our time. I am acquainted
with a man of 76 who worked amongst the dyna-
mite fumes in deep mines at Clunes for half a life-
time, and is now toiling in a wet shaft in Ballarat
East for 7s. fid. a shift, and he is not, so far as I
can gather, generally looked upon as a pheno-
menon or a fit subject for a State pension.—S.S.
The late Prof. Hearn (Melb.) had a unique
way of emphasising the salient points in his
lecture on law. His method was to make his class
illustrate the law in their own persons. For
example, to exemplify the law of maintenance, he
would pick out the youngest and most blushful
male before him—a theological student, if possible
—and in the calmest manner describe him as a
deep-dyed Lothario with interesting batches of
twins and triplets scattered over the face of a
smiling country, and ask him what he intended to
do when the cases came on. Again, turning to the
rowdiest undergrad. in the class, he would re-
mark : “Now, Robinson, suppose you were chap-
lain to a building society and Wilkinson (pro-
bably a member of the Christian Alliance) was a
professional burglar, and he stole your watch
from your pocket while you were having a quiet
five rounds with Joe Goddard, what remedy
would you have ? ” It was all done very good-
naturedly ; but the Prof, once made an ugly slip
—in supposing something about Miss Jones’s new
set of misfit teeth and a litigious dentist. The
lady, whose teeth happened to be bad, walked out
in high dudgeon.
Prior Vaughan’s determination to forego
the use of the plate in his dealings with the flock
he proposes to gather under the designation of the
“ Heathen at Home,” marks the strongest feature
of difference between his scheme and that of
General Booth. Last year Booth raised £153,000,
£139,000 of which he himself estimates as the
voluntary subscriptions of the parties to whom he
preached.
The oldest slab in the first Melb. cemetery
is inscribed “In memory of Frederick William,
son of Skene Craig, merchant, Melbourne, died
Marfch, 1837, aged 18 months.” The most expen-
sive tomb thus seeks, to perpetuate the fame apd
the virtues of a long-forgotten magnate:— In
memory of the Hon. James Horatio Nelson Cassell,
Collector of Customs, member of the Executive
and Legislative Councils of Victoria, this monu-
ment has been erected by his fellow-colonists in
acknowledgment of eminent public servicearen-
dered to the colony. Born at London 11 Dec.,
1814, died at Hawksburn House, near Melbourne,
21 Nov., 1853, aged 39 y-rs.” J

rung in the ladder of his
ambition. The little boy

now remains but the Privy

The late Rev. Dr. Ful-
lerton—the “Sydney Kins-
man ” —who left a pot of
money and a lot of real
property, mostly made out
of wedding-fees, used to
boast that he never exacted
a fee “ for the sacrament of
matrimony,” When the
couple went into the little
parlor arid made the" en-
quiry th4y were blandly
told there was no charge
for the “ceremony.” Bbt

shoulder and informed tjtat
there was “a registration-
fee ” of one guinea to be
paid.
Of the men who made fortunes out of
Broken Hill, J. S. Reid became connected with
the field through establishing a little paper at
Silverton ; Walter Sully kept a small store at the
same place; the Horns were taken there Ffy a
bank-managership; the Wilsons, formerly con-
nected with S.A. mines, went first to Day Dream;
George M'Culloch was manager of Mt. Gr|ms
station ; Rasp and Charley were workmen on the
station ; the Brodribbs owned Toolamacca statfbn,
close handy ; Harvey Patterson had Burta sta-
tion ; and several other big men got in early
through their connection with far-western sqUat-
tages. Those who didn’t, are now mostly “ broke.”
Baron von Mueller, Australia’s greatest
and least pretentious scientist, and one whbse
fame reaches to the four corners of the world,
will celebrate his 70th anniversary on Sun-
day, June 30th, and the occasion will surely prove
that the good old man has “honor, kfve,
obedience, troops of friends.” In fact, the Baron
has simply honors heaped upon him. He is »
doctor of medicine and philosophy, and for his
botanical work has received three of the highest
scientific honors in the world—the Fellowship'of
the Royal Society of London and the memberships
of the Academy of Science of Berlin and of the
Institute of France. He was also created an
hereditary baron by the King of Wiirternburg, is
a chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, atfd
has been dabbed knight by the raonarohs of
Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Denmark, Hawaii,
Holland, Italy, Portugal, Prussia, Saxe-Coburg-
Gotha, Spain, and Weimar. He has been Vic.
Government Botanist and Director of the Botani-
cal Museum since ’52, and held in addition from
’57 to ’73 the post of Director of Melb. BotaniCSQ
Gardens. Likewise, he can write after his naff.e
F.L.S., F.G.S., F.G.S., F.R.G.S., and can Use
up, without difficulty, a whole fount of capitals
after that in the effort to indicate that he is also a
member —either honorary, corresponding, or ordi-
nary—of nearly 100 other societies scattered over
all six continents. Summarised, Ferdinand von
Mueller is about equal to one Baron, one Knigfit
Commander, one Chevalier, twelve Knights, tivo
Doctors, seven Fellows, and about 100 members—
i.e., he is equal to 124 other more or less distin-
guished people. His published-works and essays
are every bit as numerous as the initials he can
tack on to his name.

(< Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “ a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland, where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing tor an aspir-
ing comique, pro. or amateur.’*

Mr. TRENWITH—The ladies who had
*been retired had endeavoured to secure
influence. He had permitted the ladies to
interview him as frequently as they liked—
(laughter)—and be had told them they had
got from the' slate all that they had bargained
for on entering the service. He hoped the
amendment would be negatived/
While Mr. Hancock was considering the
misfortunes of the lady teachers, he (Mr..
Trenwith) was considering the misfortunes
of unity.
Mr. WINTER.-Hear, hear. That is the,
labour standpoint.
Mr. G. TURNER said he had explained
when bringing forward the bill that it meant
the saving of about £20,000 a year. Last
session the Government was blamed for pot
ting taxation on the peopie instead of re-
trenching, and now that it was bringing
forward retrenchment proposals it was being
condemned. (Criesof “No.”) The Govern-
ment had been challenged with having de-
stroyed the defence force because it had re-
duced its strength so as to economise. It
had been accused of dispensing with the
brains of the pnblic service and keeping the
bone and muscle ; of having trampled upon
the small daisies and alldwed the tall poppies
to remain uncut; and of having starved tbd
►neglected children, and of having starved
the public servants by dispensing with fires*.
Its proposition to reduce the fees to jurors
had been opposed, and now because it wished
to* save money by allowing office re to retire on
pensions from the overmanned public se^viee,

session for jeprepcbmept were complaining.

POINTS
The Argus : “The Premier’s Premier—
Trenwith.”
The S.A. Civil Service is to be further
“out.” Even salaries up to £l5O will, it is said
be attacked.
Chinamen are now refused relief work at
the Centennial Park, Sydney, on account of the
objections of the negro and white workmen. The
negroes claim to be “ Englishmen.”
“The misfortune of Parkes’ platforms on
all occasions has been that there has never been
any room on any of them but for one man—and
that was Parkes.” — Premier Reid.
Vie. Labor-party is divided into the goats
who follow Prendergast, and the sheep whose
shepherd is Trenwith. This gives the division-lists
a queer aspect from the democratic standpoint.
Vic. Postmaster-General has decided to
close all post-offices where the average business is
not more than three letters a day. Forty offices,
costing ,£lOOO per annum, will be thus abolished.
Up to date, £150,000 has been received
on account of the Vie. Income-tax—about seven-
eighths of the year’s total. Evidently there is still
money in Victoria somewhere —buried in the back-
yard, probably.
N.S. Wales is governed by an illicitly-
distilled blend of Government by Contradiction,
Government by Coalition, Government by Com-
mission, Government by Caucus, and Govern-
ment by Inspectors.
There are now 62 members of N.S.W.
Legislative Council, almost all nominees of H.
Parkes and G. R. Dibbs. Premier Reid gets
credit for two, the juniors of the House, Dr.
Garran and J. H. Want.
The S.A. National Ass is trying to estab-
lish locally women’s political societies on the lines
of the English Primrose League. Before adult
suffrage became law, Tory politicians said only
the “lower ordahs ” would avail themselves of it.
On the Lower Burdekin plantations colored
labor is rampant —on one plantation in particular.
Here the Jap. can be seen in all his glory. A
railway is being built —by Japs. ; sleepers are
being out —by Japs. ; plates are being laid—by
Japs. ; even in the fitting-shop operations are
being carried out —by Japs. White men often
sleep out in the cow-yard and adjourn when it
rains to the stables. The Jap. is intelligent,
suave and far more adaptable and docile than the
Chinese. He looks upon Queensland as his happy
hunting-ground, and is quietly training himself to
enter any and every sphere at present occupied by
European labor.
A boot controversy is raging in N.S.W.
Under Protection the imports of boots decreased
by nearly two-thirds, but the quantity of boots
locally manufactured remained practically sta-
tionary. Therefore, it seems that during the
Protective period there was such an improvement
in the quality of the locally-made boot that the
nation got through with a smaller supply ; or else
it got so poor that it had to do with less boots ;
or there was an alarming increase in the number
of one-legged men ; or people are giving up boots;
or the statistics are wrong—or something. The
Bulletin, after much hard thinking, believes it is
something.
Premier Reid believes in compensating the
publican, if his trade is destroyed by Act of Par-
liament, because said trade has grown up with
the permission and assistance of the State, and
for the State to wipe it out now would be confisca-
tion. But he doesn’t believe in compensating the
sugar-growers, although their industry was also
created by the State, whioh industry he now pro-
poses to destroy, together with the capital invested
in it. And the Dibbs-Lyne crowd, when it gets in
again, proposes to badly damage the importing
business, also without compensation. Why should
Bung be compensated if these other people are
only to be confiscated ?
Dear Bulletin, —Re Darley at £230 a
week. Appointed C.-J. under provisions of N.S.W.
Charter of Justine. Under Sec. 7 thereof no C.-J.
is capable of taking any other office or place of
profit or emolument on pain of immediate de facto
voidance of C.-J.-ship and forfeiture of salary.
Appointed Lieut.-Gov. by Royal mandate (only).
Statutes only repealed by statutes. Query ; Did
not Darley on his first aeceptanoe of pay forfeit
his prior office ? Further : What about all subse-
quent legal proceedings before him? Further:
Would the Supreme Court hold a Governorship at
£7OOO per an. not an office or place of profit or
emolument? I want to know.— Tom Smith.
Editor Bulletin. —Sir, —The note of
triumphal jubilation by the Sydney morning
papers, on what they are pleased to term the Free-
trade victory, is net justified by the facts. The
victory is to Land-Nationalisation, not Freetrade.
Take away the plank of unimproved-land-value
tax from the Govt, platform and Freetrade would
be nowhere. The other side had just the same
chance and threw it overboard to propitiate vested
interests. This is Reid’s chance, but let him hesi-
tate to push the reform right through to the bitter
end and be is dead as Julius Cajsar. Even now
in the Freetrade ranks doubting conspirators are
watching and the distrustful Labor guerillas are
ready to strike.— Brutus.
The Parkes-Dibbs friendship is understood
to be at an end, and the N.S.W. two-headed
infant has resolved into his original component
parts, which parts regard each other with their
old hostile expression. Two-headed infants seldom
Tivs long.
“ The worst of social miseries being op-
pression under the sanction, color and form of
law, the reliance of the country (and the sole hope
of persons under accusation, and of suitors in
appeals to the law) are on the good sense, inte-

in Melb. Trades’ Hall is like the corner in the
old-time Legislative Assembly. Curious that, as
Parnell was a Protestant, so the two most dis-
tinguished Vic. democrats Higinbotham and
Wilson Gray—were Freetraders.”
July 1 is “Dominion Day” in Canada,
and “Separation Day” in Victoria. Thus an
Australian province, which professes to be the
home of Federal sentiment, still rejoices on the
anniversary of the day on which it won its'lnde-
pendence from one of the provinces with which it
now seeks alliance!
“If Australian Federation is to be judged
by the public actions and utterances of its pro-
fessed advocates, there is a danger that men will
come to regard the movement as a deliberately-
planned conspiracy for defeating the honest desires
of the people of Australia for industrial and social
reforms.”— Frank Cotton.
A very loyal Melb. paper admits that
knighthoods have never advanced Australasian
politicians. To be sure :
The politician smug who chases
The smiles of people in high places,
Is aptly made a knight at last
To indicate his day is past.
There are in N.S.W. Legislative Assembly
about 14 men who, so far as the world knows,
could afford to do without their official .£3OO a

drawal of pay would mean something like starva-
tion. Free and unfettered choice is impossible to
the electors without Payment of Members.
This is a Parkesian prophecy fulfilled.

The Bulletin does not believe that Aus-

the time has now arrived for Australia to return
the compliment.

The cable says that U.S. employers are
proposing to organise non-unionists, to prevent

rgaeisation of the disorganised will do no harm
no unionism. The “ united non-unionists ” would
not take a sweater’s wage—and the employers
would not pay these, the unskilled residue of the
labor-market, the wages that would secure skilled
workmen and peace;
One of the benefits accruing from the
establishment »f the Maoriland State Loan Depart-
ment, apart from the lowering of interest, is the
great reduction in law-costs. The ordinary legal
expenses attached to a private mortgage of £2500,
if the land is under the old Act, are £45 11s.,
whereas the State does the business for £7 12s.
If the property mortgaged is under the Land
Transfer Act, the private charges are £39185., but
the Loan Department only exacts £4 7s. 6d.
State competition has already brought down
interest and it will also necessarily bring down
law charges, therefore the legal brigade gnashes
its best Sunday teeth at the department, and
would gladly consign it to the Worm that is not
quenched, or thereabouts.
The Assembly election for N. Adelaide
(S.A.) was the biggest political jumble locally
known. Paddy Glynn (elected) was the nominee
of the Ass, but was also supported by the majority
of the Labor-party, whilst Wadey, although an
Ass man, was ignored by that body. Had the
workers nominated a candidate they could have
easily carried the seat, but S.A. Labor-party is
sadly disunited just now.
It was an amusing spectacle when “ Holy

THOSE LAVENDER BAY STEPS.
“ There’s a lady at the top, sir, wants yer to ’urry back ;
she says yer ’ouse is a-fire.”
Ministry, got up and solemnly presented to him-
self and his colleagues a petition from his own
Freetrade constituency asking him and them to
retain the protective duty on kerosene, and thus
not do what the same constituency expressly
stated at the general election that it wanted done
at once. Politics is a badly-mixed business.
When Balak sent for Balaam to curse the
Jews, Balaam found it difficult, not being ac-
quainted with the nation. Balak burnt 21 oxen,
and did his best to advertise Balaam, but Balaam
wouldn’t curse. This is the parable of Michael
Davitt and the Vic. Free-raiders. Max Hirsch
suit for Davitt to curse Protection, and the Single-
tax League made oxen of themselves, and other
Free-raiders forged an alleged saying of Davitt’s
and advertised it on the railway-stations—so
Davitt cursed them and not Protection. And
Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam.
The expenditure on strong urink in Maori -
land for ’94 was £2 17s. 2d. per inhabitant. Ten
years previously it was«.£4 ss. per inhabitant, and
15 years back (in ’79) it is alleged to have been as
high as £6 10s. Considering this excellent result,
the Prohibitionists should leave well alone. The
nation is evidently leaving off drink of its own
accord, and where things are improving much
faster than anyone has reason to expect, it is mere
foolishness to begin shoving behind to make them
go faster still.
One consideration which doubtless hurried
the Seddon Government into its seizure of the un-
finished Midland Railway of Maoriland was the
necessity of finding land for settlement. Under
the fatuous contract which Stout and Vogel made
with the devastating English capitalist, all the
State lands remaining in Canterbury, Westland,
and Nelson provinces (6,000,000 acres or more)
were locked up against settlement until the line
was finished, and the railway co. had selected its
land-grant out of them. This lock-up has lasted
for seven years, and seemed likely to last for
another twenty, till at last the agriculturist who
wanted soil grew tired of waiting, and urged
>,<ldon into activity. Even now nothing can be
done with the land until at least 15 months’ notice
has bpim given to the defaulting co.
Melb. Single-taxers are covering the local
hoardings with huge "garish posters, inscribed :
“Michael Davitt says, ‘No intelligent working
man can be a Protectionist.’ ” If it comes to
quotes and advts., why don’t the Protectionists
garishly advertise Carlyle’s remark, “A Free-
trader is another way of saying a darned fool ”
or words to that effect.
Higgins, M.F. (one of the leaders of the
Equity Bar), takes a firm stand in defence of the
Vic. tariff, which is gall and wormwood to the
local Free-raiders. The A RGCS gets into one more
unholy dilemma by declaring in general terms
that Victoria cried aloud at last election for tariff
reform, and in particular terms that Higgins took
his stand against the alleged tariff reform so as to
secure a seat.
Victoria is at present in
possession of a tariff which has
been added to by Freetraders,
Fat men, and Conservatives, as
well as by democratic and un-
democratic Protectionists —and
the earth is asked to wonder
because it is not the most per-
fect tariff possible. The Argus
has invented a rail for politi-
cians to sit on —25 per cent,
duties—and sundry very feeble
bores take up a silly position
on this fence, without troubling
themselves as to its security.
There can be no compromise
between Protection and Free-
trade. There is a large gulf
fixed between, yet some men try
to sit on that gulf. If Foreign-
trade is desirable let it be free—
if it is desirable for certain
articles, let it be free for those
articles. If, on the other hand,
the country wants to “ protect ”
any industry—let the protection
be whole-hearted and effective.
It may extend the horizon
of some N.S.W, income-tax
orator, at the present juncture,
to be informed that, throughout
the whole history of her Re-
publics, France has rejected
income-tax proposals. The last
proposal—about a year ago—
was thrown out by a majority
of 257 to 236. in the Chamber
of Deputies. The Swiss Republic
condemns the taXj and has re-
jected it whenever proposed.
Britain, Prussia, Sweden and
Norway approve of the tax, and
collect it annually, some of them
changing the amount per £ every
year, while others retain the
same figure for decades. Aus-
tria and Denmark impose the
tax some years, and other years
reject it, the inference from all
facts being that monarchical
countries are less opposed to the
tax than republican ones.
One-adult-one-vote was first adopted in
the Southern Hemisphere 40 years ago when Guu
Denison, who served both in Tasmania and N.S.
Wales, applied the theory to the little Settlement-,
of Norfolk Island. That Gov. believed the theory
the soundest for young countries and prophesied
that it would yet prevail in every section of the
Antipodes ; but, notwithstanding the uniform
success of the Norfolk Island experiment over so
many years, half of Australia still trembles, or
pretends to tremble, when the innovation is men-
tioned.
A tax of a penny in the shilling upon
tickets of admission to “places of public amuse-
ment ” is seriously suggested by Melb. journals.
If they include theatres among taxable places of
amusement, the writers are evidently scribbling in
the dark. Williamson and Musgrove, The Bul-
letin fancies, would prefer to take a halfpenny in
the shilling on gross receipts as their share of the
profits these times, and let the Government have
the balance of profit or loss. Outdoor sport-
shows—football and cricket matches, &c. —are fair
marks for taxation, inasmuch as the promoters are
not playing up a lot of capital in a very risky busi-
ness. Racing, too, might be easily taxed through
the totalisator, if not at the gates. But a levy
upon theatre takings would never do, and suppos-
ing that bookers of seats in advance were charged
per cent, extra, the gain to the public exchequer
wouldn’t be worth talking about.
Dear Bulletin, —Nothing so illustrates
the inanity of the Freetrader as the proposed State
project of finding a market in England for N.S.W.
barley. It iss worse than sending coal to New-
castle, A cable last week intimated that Chaplin
was endeavoring to impose a tariff in the interests
of the ruined British farmer. Minister Sydney
Smith talks of the superior N.S. W. grain. Bosh !
The repeal of the malt-duty in 1880, like the
abolition of the N.S.W. tea-duty, only stimu-
lated the importation of inferior rubbish. Then
while N.S.W. is vainly seeking a market for
malting barley, all her brewers are using imported
malt, principally Victorian. Let the N.S.W.
excise on beer be reduced and a corresponding
impost placed on imported barley, and the home
brewers will immediately consume as much barley
as the farmers can grow. But while they can im-
port they will not go to the expense of erecting
kilns, cisterns, floors, &c. Shifting the tax from
the finished beer to the raw material cannot affect
the poor consumer, and thus obviates one Free-
raid “lament.” —V.

New Plymouth (M.L.) Harbor Board, in a time
of temporary aberration, borrowed a large sum in London
at 6 per cent. After paying up honorably for a number
of years it fell into difficulties, and, as the bondholders
wouldn’t reduce their atrocious rate of interest, New
Plymouth defaulted. It now pays about 4 per cent, a
remarkably good return, and owes the rest. The bond-
holders, therefore, stuck up Treas. Ward on the sub-
ject, and demanded that the State should guarantee their
6 per cent, and pay up all arrears, failing which they
would do their best to shut out M.L. Govt, stocks from
the London market, and would wreck the new loan, if pos-
sible. Ward's reply was, practically, that the M.L.
Treasury was in no way responsible for New Plymouth’s
purely local borrowings ; that the bondholders knew that
when they lent the money, for no State-guaranteed loan
would carry such a rate as 6 per cent.; that their demand
for a State guarantee and 6 per cent, was highway rob-
bery ; that their threat to wreck the M.L. loan unless the
State bought them off by paying a liability in which it
wasn’t concerned was blackmail, pure and simple; and
that he would see the New Plymouth bondholders dead
first. Which solid, but unpleasant, truths broke up the
negotiation.
* * * *
In 1891— the last year for which complete statis-
tics are available—foreign fire and marine insurance com-*
panics, mostly British, took £70,000 out of N.S. Wales in
net profits, and sent it “Home” to pay divs. to share-
holder Bull. Assuming that the other Australian pro-
vinces are exploited at the same rate, this makes £280,000
a year sent out of the country under this heading alone,
and it is only one among dozens of small, unnoticed leak-
ages through which Australia’s coin goes to dear old
Hingland. And this country gets nothing in return for
the loss. It could get its insurance quite as easily and
safely from the local companies and keep the £280,000
per an. in the country. Out of 36 foreign co’s. doing busi-
ness in N.S.W. during ’9l, no less than 18 are returned as
having no assets whatever in the province for the security
of their policy-holders, and four more had less than £2OOO
worth of assets among them. Wanted, a massive tax on
foreign fire and marine insurance companies.

One solid reason why the Australian Govts,
should issue their inscribed loans locally is the charge of
12s. 6d. per £lOO made by the British Govt, for stamp-
duty on all issues made in the U.K. For every million
pounds Australia thus pays £6250 for stamps alone 1
Bank and brokers’ charges run up the expense to an
average of £1 6s. per £lOO ; and as these can be dispensed
with in Australia, a loan floated at £98145. here is as good
as one that realises £lOO at the other end.
♦ * ♦ *
In England the banks hold about 10 per cent, of
their liabilities in cash ; in the U.S. about 7 per cent. ; in
Canada about 5 per cent. In Australasia they keep 25
per cent, of their deposits in cash, and with all this
money (about £26,000,000) lying idle they are no safer—
perhaps hardly so safe—as the others. The.explanation
is that in Canada, the U.S., and England the banks hold
large reserves in Govt, securities, which are as good as
cash and produce interest, while cash reserves produce
nothing. And the reason why the Australasian banks
can’t do likewise is because seven idiotic Governments
insist on selling almost all their securities in London, and
Govt, stocks are hardly obtainable at this end. The
exorbitant rate charged for advances is one of the natural
consequences. The bank that has to keep one-fourth of
its deposits—on which it pays interest—lying idle as a
reserve must lend out the other three-fourths at high
rates in order to live. And, in order to get the high
interest, it has often to take very low security—and
bursts. Even the cormorant bank has some excuse for
its rapacity.
If the Colonial Bank gets a reduction of interest
on reconstructed deposits to 24 per cent., how long will it
be before other banks have to follow suit? How can the
institution which pays 4J per cent for its money compete
with the one which pays only 24?
* * * *
South Australia proposes to “convert ” some of
her existing debt into new stock at reduced interest.
The process, unfortunately, doesn’t look promising, for
most of the loans don't mature until far on in next cen-
tury. Over £1,000,000 of the S. A. debt bears interest at
6 per cent., and the last instalment of this gruesome
liability can’t be got rid of until 1918. N.S.W., Queens-
land, W.A., Tasmania, and Maoriland also pay 6 per cent,
on a portion of their debt, and the latter province has the
fragments of some 6J and 7 per cent, loans still standing.
Also, all the provinces except Queensland are paying 5
per cent, on a large portion of their debt (N.S.W. owes
£4,000,000 at this exceedingly steep rate, and the last
instalment doesn’t fall due until 1902). The old financial
fathers of the land who borrowed money at exorbitant
interest, and fixed the liability for 30 years, left a weighty
burden behind them.

London Economist cries aloud on behalf of
that soft-headed and hard-hearted person, the British
Infestor. Vic. County Court Judges, it seems, must be
made independent to look after the 8.1.’s interests.
Which suggests a delusive hope that the British Infestor
might be eternally frightened away by a judicial white-
washing of all the boomsters and land bankrupts that
have not “ gone through.” As only the small fry are
left it would not be a big sacrifice to pass them through
the mill. But the commercial immorality of Melbourne
will not succeed where the Socialism of Maoriland has
failed. The British Infestor has lent money to Socialists,
and that proves that debentures offered by Old Nick on
the security of his sulphur matches wmuld find buyers.

N.S. Wales, at Ist January, 1895, owed

culated on the amount actually received by the province
when it sold these securities, the local debt costs £3 18s.

over £4 per cent. The British money-market is an ex-
pensive place.

The Mount Lyell (Tas.) Mining 00. recently
attempted to sell £150,000 worth of 6 per cent, debentures
in London. The brokers, however, proceeded to demand
a number of further concessions, in addition to the very
liberal 6 per cent., and, after much expensive cabling, the
offer was withdrawn. The debentures were then offered
in Melbourne, and subscribed in a single day, at a much
higher price than J. Bull had offered. The only really
surprising feature about the business is the foolishness of
the Mount Lyell people in resorting to London at all.

A new swindle. Someone in Hamburg stole or
obtained some invoice-forms from a big house. With
these filled up to represent a £440 shipment of merchan-
dise, they got from the representatives of an Antipodean
bank a large portion of this amount, the bank security, of
course, being the goods, which were shipped to an Aus-
tralasian port. Delivery of documents could not be given
until the bank was paid. Now' it appears that the mer-
chandise was sent a very round-about way, and addressed
to a bogus house, so the rascals had time to vanish. The
bank eventually decided to examine its security. On the
Customs opening up the cases they found each one to
contain two other cases, one inside the other, and made
of a heavier wood than the outside package. The firm in
Hamburg, of course, knows nothing about it, and the
bank’s representatives say that this firm employs so many
clerks that they could not remember what kind of gentle-
man opened the business. The shipping-agents, of
course, willingly gave freight and B/L forms when they
saw the packages properly marked and addressed, so the
bank has to bear the loss.

N.S. Wales this year has 1,323,814 acres under
crop, being 116,822 acres more than in the previous year
and nearly 500,000 acres more than in the last year of the

gressed five times as fast under the present regime as

A large number of counterfeit shillings—dates

The “ meejuin of exchange ” disease has invaded
the pulpit. The Rev. Tuck, of South Broken Hill
(Baptist)preached on a recent Sunday on “Bimetallism:
What say the Scriptures?” Text: “Why silver has
become dross.” Mr. Tuck floored the heretical mono-
metallist with a brand-new version of a well-known
Scriptural incident. “It seems to me,” he preached,
“ that it was this very injustice in the rates of exchange
which aroused the righteous indignation of the Lord
Jesus when he overthrew the tables of the money-
changers I”

The London Bank of Australia’s balance-sheet
for the half-year ended 31st December, ’95, appears in
another column. Compared with the return for the same
half-year of ’93, the reconstructed deposits have been
reduced by £500,000, while the current accounts and new
deposits have increased by £160,000. The note circula-
tion has dropped by £20,000. The general business of
the bank is apparently being well sustained, and the
cash reserve is £250,000 larger than it was. Also, it would
seem that so far there have been no losses worth speak-
ing of in realising the assets of the old London Chartered
Bank, for the large sum set apart to cover any possible
liability in this direction remains intact, and is accumu-
lating interest. Also, the net profits in the present
balance-sheet are £8216, against £7026 for last half-year,
and £5916 for the one preceding. The position is ap-
parently as sound as could be desired for the bank's
creditors, and it seems reasonably good for the 54 per
cent, preference shareholders, who, so far, have received
their dividend regularly. For the ordinary shareholders
there is no position worth mentioning.

The Bank of Victoria started a practical

The Royal Bank of Queensland has been en-
deavouring to raise money in London, by the sale of 4
per cent, “deposit stock,” wherewith to pay off the re-
mainder of its 4J per cent, reconstructed deposits. Ap-
parently, however, like the Mount Lyell mining 00., it
finds the ways of the London market very hard, and, at
latest advices, proposes to give 4J per cent, for two years,
and 4 per cent, thereafter. So far as can be judged by
the scanty cable information, the Royal is doing some-
thing particularly foolish. It could almost to a certainty
get the required amount in Australia at 4 per cent., and
thus save a considerable amount of interest, and by pay-
ing off its British creditors, get rid of a remote and awk-
ward liability. And, amid the general uncertainty of
things, 4 per cent, is a sufficiently heavy liability, con-
sidering that it is a fixed burden, and not one which can
be paid off at the bank’s option, like the existing recon-
structed deposits.

At the meeting of the British depositors in the
Standard Bank (Melb.), when they agreed to reduce to 2J
per cent., it was announced that the bank had never
earned more than that rate of interest since its recon-
struction, and the remainder of the 44 per cent, had been
paid out of the assets. The same lugubrious director
stated that when the bank’s estates were realised it would
probably be found that the capital was all lost, and
meanwhile the shareholders must go on paying calls with
the best grace they could. As for amalgamation, that
was impossible. Nobody that the Standard wants to
amalgamate with would amalgamate with the Standard.

Dear Bulletin, —Apropos yours re bi-metallism,
tri-metallism, &c. Up here we are a tin district, likewise
a silver country, also a goldfield. So that we are all there
on tljf metal question. For years we have been pro-
ducing silver that doesn’t pay decent wages. At Muldiva
they got about £2 a week at the finish; at Montalbion
they got£3, but paid this in the end at the rale of 12s. 6d.
in the £. Bi-metally, we are in a bad way. The price of
tin is regulated by the Straits output. The Straits is a
silver coinage country, and, meanwhile, we are doing our
blankest to supply the employer of Coolie and Chinkie
labor in that benighted country with cheap silver so that
he can undersell us in the tin market. We may be the
salt of the earth—to put it mildly, I suppose we are—but
the Chinkie and the Coolie and the Hindoo and the
Hottentot are the mustard and pepper and roast-beef, and
the whole bill of fare and the cook. For silver has gone
bung, and tin is suffering from locomotor-ataxy and
shuffles along anyhow, and naught but the voice of the
preserved-meatfman is heard in the land. Up to date we
have supplied the Chinkie and the Malay and the Coolie
and everything having the mark of the beast, with
ofteap silver to keep their tin-mines going, and now we
are going to lay ourselves out to supply him with cheap
meat and extract and offal and hair and bones and every-
thing that pertaineth to a meat-works. And all we
require to do it decently is another million’s worth of
railway, a deep-sinking bonus, a beef bonus, and a few
Divisional Board grants chucked in. The real evil of
these days with us up here is wanto-metallism. —Yours,
Pumpkin head, Mareeba, 23rd May, 1895, N. Queensland.

The general opinion seems to be, writes a Bul-
letin correspondent, that the Melb. universal providers
kill the small shop-keeper’s business in the neighbor-
hood. But the contrary is the fact. The big premises
are surrounded by dozens of small business jackals,
drapers, boot-shops, &c., all doing well. The business is,
in fact, attracted by the big firm, and the whole street is
well-advertised. It is the shop-keeper in other suburbs
who suffers. His suburb has no famous shop, so people
don’t trouble to come, and don’t even see his goods.

The big Melb. universal providing firms don’t
harry their employes by means of numerous shop-walkers.
They give a bonus of 2d. in the £ on all sales, and so en-
courage them to sell as much as possible. Besides this,
a half-guinea prize is given to the selling most
for the week. A counter-jumper in the millinery dept,
was, on a recent Saturday morning, bewailing his poor
chance for the prize when a carriage drove up with a
customer for a 60-guinea mantle. This, besides giving
him 10s. 6d. commission, brought him to the top of the
list and entitled him to the extra half-guinea.

munity. And as settlement increases in the surrounding
districts, the rent burden will grow larger and larger, as
such burdens always do. The object of the Renmark
concession was to “ open up the country” according to
the good old wheeze; but as the people who opened up
the country keep it after it is opened, S.A. profits nothing
by the opening.

The President of the Board of Agriculture has
stated in the Commons that henceforth all butter im-
ported into England will be officially sampled and
analysed. Is not that on all fours with the demand made
that spirits imported into N.S.W. shall be examined by a

demand which is variously styled unnecessary or a per-
nicious interference with the course of trade ?

Dear Bulletin, —Some remarks apropos to your
recent leader on the N.S.W. sugar industry. The s.s.
Maoleay lately landed 40 Hindoos here (Wyrallah), and I
hear that fully 200 more are on the way. That will
make a total of about 500 in this district alone. The
sugar industry is more than “piebald” here—it is
black, with white points. Rifled hen-roosts, pillaged
vegetable-gardens, exposure of person to little girls,
gross assaults on little boys, the waylaying of children
on the way to school, and what looks like leprosy, but
may be some other vile disease, are among the bless-
ings conferred on us by these black devils. Disease is
rampant in the cane, scarcely a field being free. In my
opinion, it doesn’t matter a “Hindoo” what becomes of
the sugar industry in N.S.W.—Cornstalk. Wyrallah,
Richmond River, May 25, '95.
* • • •
Editor Bulletin, —Re the sugar-industry. You
say that the low-lying lands of the Clarence and Rich-
mond are played out for cane-growing, and from this you
draw the inference (that the industry is not worth pro-
tecting. It may interest you to know that, so far from
this being the fact, there are thousands of acres of high
land not yet cultivated that can be brought under sugar-
cane which would be of high density and would yield
heavy crops. In fact, there is enough such land available
on the Richmond and Tweed to grow all the sugar re-
quired in N.S. Wales, but with the uncertainty of the
tariff no new mills are likely to be erected. The industry
at present employs (at the best wages in N.S.W., bar
shearing) 6000 white men, and I would ask Freetraders,
especially Frank Cotton, to tell me how these
men are to be profitably employed if their pre-
sent occupation is taken away. There is no other
line in agriculture that can absorb them, and where are
the factories or trades that require them ? Another point
worth considering is that £1,000,000 has been invested in
the business, and, if the duty is taken off now, would be
mostly lost. About two years ago I rented 60 acres of
land and spent £6OO on it in planting and cultivating
cane. I will only get one cutting off it before the duty
comes off, and this will not repay me the money I am out
of pocket, much less pay me for my work. My case is
simply one of hundreds. Now, coming to black labor, I
admit at once that there are a number of Kanakas on the
Tweed, but there are not 20 on the Richmond, and I don’t
think that many on the Clarence. A number of Hindoos
are growing cane on this river, but compete very little
with the white workers, and I am sure 99 per cent,
of the farmers would be glad to see them go. I,
therefore, claim that the duty is money well spent
when it is considered that it is supporting not less than
20,000 persons in a comfortable manner. I have very
little to say about the C.S.R. Co., but I would draw the
Labor-party’s attention to the fact that this co.’s relations
with its employes have always been of a most liberal
and satisfactory nature —I don’t think there has ever
been a strike among its men, and wages have always been
above the average, canecutters earning from £4O to £45
per season of 20 weeks, with tucker added. I don’t see
that the N.S.W. canegrowers will have anything to fear
from Federation, for it is not likely that Queensland
would be allowed to continue the black-labor traffic, and
we can stand on our own bottom and compete with them
if they employ white men.—l am, &c., Chbribon.

Setting-machines don’t appear to be an imme-
diate possibility on Melb. Aob. David Syme recently put
in a type-foundry, and a new dress is rapidly being oast
for the big paper.
Manager Wynne, of Sydney D.T., has accom-
plished the amalgamation of the rival press cable-syndi-
cates, and in the near future the Australian dailies will
deal out their breakfast budget of foreign fairy-tales on
purely monopolistic lines. This combine was mooted
some years ago, but the then stately Argus held aloof.
The union will effect a colossal saving to the proprietaries
concerned, and the new association will prove “a corker”
to any new opposition to the existing papers in any of the
big cities.

Dear Bulletin, —No wonder rents are low in
Melb. and landlords are “ loud in their wail,” but there
are greater sufferers than the property-owners. In boom
time thousands of workers were persuaded to secure
homes of their own through the various mushroom build-
ing-societies, &c. Crippled by the depression, at least 70
per cent, of these families fell into arrears, and, after pay-
ing off a considerable portion of the purchase-money, have
had their houses seized by societies, the original object of
which— vide prospectuses—was to provide our working
classes with healthy homes of their own in the only
manner possible to the humble wage-earner. In hundreds
of cases the houses were almost paid for when seized, and,
as a matter of course, the liquidators can afford to let
these places at absurdly low figures. The workman pays
dearly for everything that’s cheap. - Snell.

Owing to the N.S.W. duty of 2d. per lb. on
butter, cream is now taken into Broken Hill from S.A.
and churned there. The factory, though only just started,
already deals with 100 gallons of cream daily. Hitherto
the duty has led to the importation of most of the butter
from the Sydney side. The wine-duty led long ago to the
importation of grapes, and the establishment of a press at
the Hill.

Dear Bulletin,—Some reasons for Wyalong
non-success. Managers of crushing batteries have been
purchasing from owners tailings and blanketings, the

While exploring the new kaolin body at the
Central (8.H.) some old uncharted workings were cut
into. The south drive at 80ft. met a mullocked-up set,
the continuation of workings from the east. The set,
evidently six or seven years old, had good kaolin ore on
two sides, and why it was mullocked-up and exploration
discontinued is a mystery. The discovery recalls one
made at the Junction some time since, where it was found
that a rich ore-shoot had been tested by bore-holes from
an adjacent drive, the holes having been then plugged up.
♦ • « »
The sale of B.H. Central for .£175,000 may be
considered. •*off.” The recent development of kaolin
where none was expected has wonderfully helped the
malcontents. The possibility of the whole business being
little else than a market move never seemed to strike
anybody. Rioh as the kaolin development may be, it has
little effect on the market, which went up on the offer
alone. If the offer to buy a mine for £175,000 subject to
a deposit of a few thousands is sufficient to send shares
to par, then the making of offers can be made good
business. Without the solution of the sulphide problem,
there is, so far, nothing in the Central mine to make it
worth £175,000.

After many years fruitless prospecting the Car-
lisle, Bendigo, is on the div. list. It was a big mine 20
years ago. After J. B. Watson’s death it acquired the
Kentish claim, out of which J. B. made hundreds of
thousands, and it is in this ground the strike has been
made.
* • * »
Things are looking much better for G. Lansell
on Bendigo. The value of the strike in the 180 at 3100 ft.,
though not fully determined, is good enough as far as
opened. He is also working the Comet at a good profit,
although it is only running 6dwts., and in several of the
recent developments in other mines he is largely in-
terested. Under these circumstances, George has pro-
bably abandoned his threat to clear out and live in dear
old England.

Roberts and Sons, of Bendigo, are turning out a

The most permanent-looking div. mines in
Bendigo to-day are the New Prince of Wales and New
Moon. The former was abandoned before the deep-sink-
ing age, and is now opening up a big body of stone at
300 ft. It. has, so far, averaged an oz. Unlike most of
the Bendigo mines, it has no deep levels, and has, there-
fore, all virgin country below 300 ft. The New Moon, too,
is not a deep mine. Both occupy isolated positions. The
Prince is supposed to he on the Sebastian line, but the
fact is not established beyond a doubt.

instead?

South Star, Ballarat, having spent thousands
in development, and worked at a loss for years, now holds
a good credit, and chairman Vale anticipates early divs.
Last crushing, 305 tons, averaged close on 17Jdwt. The
Star of the East, adjoining, has driven north at the
1000 ft. level and picked up the continuation of the stone
now being operated by the South Star. Stone, sft. wide,

Of all Australian gold-fields, Charters Towers
extorts most admiration for consistency. Its monthly
yield of something over 20,0000 z., at about an oz. to the
ton, has now long continued with neither undue depres-
sion nor undue exaltation, but, if anything, a slight and
sustained increase. The May yield was 21,4900 z. from
21,854 tons, paying divs. £24,662. The features of the
month, according to Bright’s circular, were the decline
in Mills United output, owing to divs. having apparently
been considered before development; and the counter-
balancing improvement in the Brilliant mines. Mount
Leyshon, by-tbe-by, now manages to make working
expenses out of 3dwt. ore, by treating up to 3000 tons per
month ; and sdwt. would show a fair profit. Share prices
are well maintained.
* * * *
Victory (Charters Towers) has made a call,
£4OOO. Half-year’s output: 1861 tons, 16350 z.; expenses,
£10,206 ; profit, £1551195. sd. The glory has departed.

Allowing for the general air of unreliability
which pervades Westralian reports, it seems that the
Londonderry has succeed in gluing together some of the
bottom which fell out of it, and has taken “several
thousand oz.” from the new shoot struck. Also, it seems
uncertainly clear that the Wealth of Expectations is
realising on a reef at 110 ft., averaging “20oz. to the ton."
And there is rather less haze about the alleged fact that
the Hit-or-Miss, north of White Feather, which is being
floated in London for £200,000 (vendors, £100,000), has a
reef “31ft. thick,” producing magnificent specimens, and
considered by complaisant “ good judges ” to be the
finest property in Westralia.

The Bulletin congratulates Lord Fingall.
Having been played upon by one or two accomplished
boomsters and fooled into believing that there were cer-
tainly millions in the Londonderry, he (a man with a re-
putation to lose) endured the horrible nightmare of seeing
the gold vanish in an hour. It re-appeared last week and
outside the newspaper-accounts, on which little reliance
is ordinarily to be placed, the writer has satisfactory evi-
dence that one of the faces of the reef (in the South drive
at the 100 ft. level) is marvellously rioh. It is, therefore,
easy to believe that the Earl is “ much pleased." But it
is almostifbo good to believe the new find is a continua-
tion of the big shoot. It is more than probably another
distinctive make of rich ore.

The Intercolonial Investment, Land and Build-

erroneously stated in a recent issue. The Intercolonial

and in times like these, when few such institutions can do
more than pay working expenses, its 6 per cent, is a re-
markable evidence of solvency and good management.

Says a recent Ooolgardie wire—and, by the way,

pectors dollied over lOOOoz.” “ Now regarded ”is good.
Like every dog, every mine has its day at Ooolgardie.

Thousands of Unsolicited Testimonials:
“The boots fit splendidly and are very cheap. You
should extend your business to N.Z., where no such system
is in vogue. I shall do what I can to recommend you.”—
GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7,1895.
“ The boots you made me from description of my foot
and self-measurements have more than satisfied me. 1
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
boots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, with duty and everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for boots not to
be compared with yours.”—JOHN M'ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreach, .Queensland. May 31,1895.
“ I am sending you an order for two more pairs of your
boots. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmanship and durability they could not be surpassed
I have had them in wear now 12 months, and there is nr»
a crack in them, and I have no more trouble with my in
growing nails or corns.”—SAML. RUTTER, Moorars
Station, River Darling, N.S.W. June 1,1895.

“ That which we call a rose, by any other
name would smell as sweet,” and so it
happens that we want to explain what
is MYFA? It is only a name,
the new name for Mitchell’s
“My Favorite” Tea. Why do
we change the name? Simply to
protect you from fraud. The success of
“My Favorite” Tea has been
gigantic; its immense popularity is so
pronounced that it has numbers of imita-
tors already, who have neither the brains
nor the inclination to get an original
name of their own
A recent decision of the Supreme Court has revealed the fact that the
words “My Favorite” can be used by anybody, and we have therefore, in
order to prevent your being misled into buying “ Favorite ” Tea, and
thinking it the celebrated blend of Mitchell’S, decided to change the name
for one that cannot be held by anyone else. . :
MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE” Tea will be sold in future under the
name of MYFA TEA (copyright).
We positively guarantee “ MYFA TEA ” to be the identical Tea hitherto
sold as MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE.” What’s in a Name ? A good
deal. Be warned! In future, when you wish to purchase MITCHELL’S
“MY FAVORITE” Tea, ask for
MYFA
EASILY REMEMBERED AS THE FIRST FOUR LETTERS OF
MY FAVORITE.

ago, a certain Australian Minister
appointed a foreign gentleman as an inspector.
The said inspector, after being filled up by his
brother officials with Munchausenish yarns about
the man-eating and red-cloth-loving blacks, went
forth into the country to inspect. Shortly one of
the leading officers of the Department received a
telegram from a horse-dealer of a big country
town : “Please send up some more foreigners; great
fun these slack times; sold him my oldest moke
for ,£2O, ’’ A few days later a despairing
telegraph message came from the inspector himself:
Horse I bought ran cart over stump secreted;
uiy bones broken, how many I do not know.’’
.Later still: “ Inform Minister my tibia broken

Two verses from “Federation”—a poem
by one J. J. Murphy, of Melbourne
See the hosts of high officials, some with salaries twice
too much,
While the working men are scanted, these folks are get-
ting rich.
They re a swim of selfish seekers who in secret so con-
nives,
They’re identical to drones, sucking honey from the hives.
The public funds are lavished by officials in the jobs,
And palm-oil so kindly given was shoved into their fobs.
Then with balls and dinner parties and choicest of cham-
pagne, '
Hooray, Hip, Hip ! they’ve got the tip, and will visit
there again.
No doubt the poet had good reasons for giving his
address as “ G.P.0.” at the end of his production.
He can’t be rushed there.
Hogue, M.L.A. (N.S.W.J : “ Victoria has
been going backward and backward as the result
of Protection. The people of Victoria have been
taxed off the soil.’’ Yet, despite her smaller area,
11,000 more people lived by agriculture in Victoria
than in N.S.W. at the date of last census returns.
And in Maoriland, which is more heavily taxed
still, a larger proportion of the people live by
agriculture than even in Victoria.
ENO’S “FRUIT SALT” removes poisonous
matter caused by vitiated air, errors of eating or
drinking, &c., by natural means. No one is safe
without having at hand some efficient means of
warding off blood poisons. After a very patient
and careful observation extending over nearly ten
years of the effects of ENO’S ‘‘FRUIT SALT,”
I have not the least hesitation in stating that if
its great value in keeping the body healthy were
universally known, not a single travelling trunk
or portmanteau would be without it. J. C. ENO,

Marriage has been a splendid success in
land-boom circles, anyway. Another big specu-
lator registers a transfer of household goods and
chattels to the wife of his bosom, in consideration
of her “ love and affection.” Good old L. and A.
How brightly they bloom in the gloaming !
A Booinster loves his ’Lizer
When the banks “ keep right ”;
Naught in reason he denies her
Whilst the sun shines bright.
Yet, although her rings and dresses
Prove the fondness he professes,
Little else that wife possesses
When the banks “keepright.”
But Boomster’s love expandeth
When the banks squeeze tight ■
His belongings then he handeth
To his Heart’s Delight.
Spite of legal snorts and strictures,
’Lizer cops the plate and pictures.
Also furniture and fixtures —
When the banks squeeze tight.
There’s a recklessness Byronic
In a love like this.
Sure, adversity’s a tonic
For hymeneal bliss.
Heaven bless mad speculations
Which lead up to complications
And result in demonstrations
Of a love like this !

SPENCER’S WEEKLY.
A Journal of Practical Reform.
WILL be devoted to the Discussion and
Exposure of the Caxises which produce
DEPRESSION and hinder the return of pros-
perity. In Economics the groundwork of its
argument will be the following axiom :
UNEARNED GAINS
Acquired by the Few, mean
Undeserved Impoverishment
Inflicted on the Many.
“SPENCER’S WEEKLY” will advocate
the gradual Resumption by the State of
the Unearned Increment in the Value of
Land. It will also advocate the RE-
MONETISATION OF SILVER, in
order to remove the CRUSHING BUR-
DEN which has been imposed upon PRO-
DUCTIVE ENTERPRISE by the
UNEARNED INCREMENT in the
VALUE OF GOLD.
“SPENCER’S WEEKLY” will advocate
the adoption of simple and effective
SANITARY MEASURES, but will
STRENUOUSLY OPPOSE
THE INFLICTION OF DISEASE BY
LAW, whether by Compulsory Vaccina-
tion, or any other form of the Compulsory
Inoculation of Disease.
A SPECIAL and MOST VALUABLE
FEATURE will be an accurate and
reliable Review of the COMMERCIAL
and MONETARY MOVEMENTS of
the WEEK.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Maoriland racing clubs have made a new
departure in working the “ tote.” The instrument now
takes deposits, and issues in exchange for them credit
notes, with which the holder can back his fancy at any
machine on the course. Many people who plunge heavily
adopt this system, as it avoids the necessity of carrying
about large sums of money, and £2OOO has been thus
deposited at one meeting. Another alteration has been
made in the system of keeping accounts. Formerly,
when a man bought his tickets at the window the dial
immediately showed how much had been added to the
total sum invested, and also how much had been added
to the amount on each horse. The crowd which was
watching outside thus knew what horses he had backed,
and if the backer was reputed to be a knowing indi-
vidual there was a rush to follow his lead, and
his div. was much reduced in consequence. Many
devices were tried to obviate this difficulty. The
simplest and commonest was to send an unknown
person to put the money on, while the knowing one
walked up to the window and publicly put a pound or two
on the most improbable animal on the list, and left the
crowd to rush the wrong horse to its heart’s content.
This worked very well, provided the person who was sent
to back the right horse didn’t give the secret away to his
own friends, or embezzle the money, or get drunk, or be
found out. Another plan was to put on £lOO or so at the
last moment, and then before the official had rung his
bell a hundred times the race would start, and the
machine had to close. But these and other dodges were
all more or less unsatisfactory, so now as the money comes
in the dial only shows the total amount invested. When
the starting-bell rings the machine closes, and then the
amounts on each horse go up. Consequently the man
who has exclusive information can run his little game on
all the machines on the course without letting the public
into the secret. This often places him in a better posi-
tion than if he bet with the bookmaker, for Mossy Isaacs
used to grow suspicious and shorten the odds before all
the money was on, while the “ tote ” is a guileless im-
plement which has no suspicions whatever.
* ♦ ♦ •
“Jack” Murray, who for several sessions has
fathered the “Tote” Bill in Vic. Assembly, has been
trying to get Govt, support for it, but Premier Turner
(solicitor, by the way, for the V.R.C. and some leading
bookmakers) won’t look at the measure. Attorney-
Gen. Isaacs, who holds many briefs for Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, can hardly “turn dog” on the crowd. All the same,
Murray’s little Bill, though not “kosher,” is likely to get
more consideration than heretofore, especially as many
of the pious brigade '“ got the run ” at last election.
Also, the prospect of the State’s making £20,000 a year
will weigh in its favor just now.

The decision of Sydney Tattersall’s Club to pay
wagers on Merry Girl makes a record even for leather-
lunged effrontery. To put the facts in a nutshell. Merry
Girl weighed in at least 21b. overweight, and no declara
tion having been made, by the rules under which the race
was run, the Kensington Club had no course open to it
but to disqualify the mare, and award the stakes to the
second horse, Pearl Powder. Merry Girl’s owner, a
prominent horse owner and member of Tatt.’s, pro-
tested against the decision, and threatened to
prosecute his claim with the utmost rigor of
the law, from the Water Police-court to the Privy
Council. Where Tattersall’s Club “came in” at this
point of the game is one of those things “no fellow can
understand,” but come in it did, and with some pur-
pose, for it actually over-rode the rule under which the
race was ridden— viz., “that wagers are inseparable from
the stakes,” and instructed its bagged and bejewelled
members to “pay Merry Girl.” That such decision
was distasteful to some of Tatt.’s committee-men
not interested in “the bag,” was evidenced by the im-
mediate resignation of the hon. treasurer, Mr. Hourigar,
and Mr. Harris.
Kensington has ever proved a thorn in the side
of the Associated Clubs, who, as might only have been
expected, joined hands with the Associated Bookmakers,
with the expectation, no doubt, of putting a nail in the
Kensington coffin. Kensington, however, is very much
alh e. Convenient to the city, it is a favorite course with
race-goers, more especially as it has the unique
reputation of trying to put down the open, bare faced
roping carried out on so many other courses ; and it is
just a question whether Kensington, with its small
entrance-fee to the paddock, would not knock out th"
long-railway-journey and half-sovereign courses, if it
decided to hold an every Saturday meeting.
Anyhow, the public are very sore just now, and
with Kensington and the totalisator in view it is not 8 ife
for either the Associated Clubs or the books to play the
game too low down on the crowd who find the sinews ol
war.

In re Sydney Tattersall’s billiard handicap, the
members are much exercised over the “ ringing in ” on a
long mark of an alleged top-notoher who, for months, has
been playing at the rooms, receiving 25 and a licking.
He has been backed to win some thousands, but layers
swear they won’t pay out over him, and when Tatt.’s men
say they won’t pay out, they won’t. Anyone who has
doubts on the subject had better ask the Pearl Powderers.

Gunboat (Sheet Anchor—Excelsior), who started
a hot favorite for the Sandown Park Handicap is said by
some to be as good as the Harvester and likely to win a

“You speak of Selling Races,”
said one old chap, after the bush race-meet-
ing. “ I ran a mare here in the early
days. It was a Selling Race, and she was
entered under ray trainer’s name to be
sold for 50 guineas. She won. At the
sale the auctioneer (he was steward and
publican as well) dwelt a long time be-
fore knocking her down, and a young chap
ran her up to £lOO. I wanted my mare,
but not at his price. As luck would have
it, the young fellow got drunk and didn’t
turn up in time to complete his purchase.
Just before she was put up again I went to
the auctioneer and told him I was the
owner, and hinted that he need not take so
long before calling her off. “ Sure, Mr.
K.,” said he, “if I’d have only known it
at first 1 Just see me do the business this
time.” He mounted the barrel and began:
“Now, gintleraen, here’s a mare by Peter
Wilkins out of a mare—l won’t desave yez—
that was not much account. Look at this
mare’s near fore leg. It’s dicky, and
to carry more than 7st. would break her
heart. None but a damn fool would kape
such a baste, so I’ll knocker down to her
owner. Fifty guineas —to her owner,

The football clubs, Pirate and Wentworth, met
to settle their disputes on Sydney Cricket Ground last
Saturday, and, for the space of 80 min., the combatants
wrestled and flopped and collared and tussled and
scrummed in order to throw ail possible light upon the
subject. The Pirate backs seemed to regard the thing
partly as a holiday outing, for their forwards kept the
Wentworth team scrumming at its own end, and whenever
the ball came near a Pirate back he promptly kicked
it 60yds. or so, and then proceeded to mark time
and await another opportunity. The Wentworth bar-
rackers continually called upon their men to “go on,”
which they undoubtedly would have done but for the
iron arm or heel or head of one of the opposing team.
One of the Wentworth team played like a philosopher,
always losing the ball whenever a Pirate man rushed at
him with assault and battery printed in his large and
glaring eye. The work in the scrums was quick and
effective ; in the space of a minute or so either the ball
would be’kicked out, or a man, or both. The Wentworths
were justly defeated by 11 points to 3.

At Wallsend, N.S.W., the other Saturday, foot-
ball barrackers gave a real taste of their quality. They
pelted the captain of the visiting and opposing team
during.the game ; after the game they pelted and hooted
the visitors off the ground, and, following them to their
hotel, where a ’bus stood full of women, they pelted the
’bus and the women with rotten eggs. The explanation
of this larrikin outburst is easy. Footbalj itself is a brutal
game, far more demoralising than boxing at its worst.
In a boxing contest with gloves one man can hit the other
with all the force he can muster in a standing posture,
but in a football match the same man running 10 yards a
second can shoot out his arm with all his strength, and
all the impetus of his speed, and stiffen a would-be
««collarer.” Moreover, in football, one man can throw
another, and if the other doesn’t let go the ball he can
gouge his eyes out, or drive his knee or elbow his
stomach or throat, or twist his neck, or break his spine.
In season ’92, in Brisbane, three football players were
killed outright upon the ground.

to “ pull the referee’s blanky liver out it he orders a

Zimmerman, the Carbine of cyclists, comes to
Australia to show his prowess as a tremendous advertising
medium for a particular brand of cycle. He has been
sought after by every cycle manufacturer, and the one
who offered Zimmerman one fourth the profit*
secured him. Last year Zimmerman made £BOOO. nut
Zimmerman will find, like every other man who visits
Australia, that the Australian youth can discriminate
between a cycle and the man who rides it, and that said
youth is shrewd enough to “drop ” to the fact that the
cycle Zimmerman races on has been constructed regard-
less of expense to suit its famous rider. Zimmerman does
not pin his faith to any particular brand of cycle ; he pins
it to the cyclist manufacturer who 'gives him the biggest
fee. It is not a cycle that makes a Zimmerman.
Zimmerman will start for Australia on Bth
Aug., and will be in Sydney the first or second day of
Sept. He will race in Sydney under the wing of the
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen, for which privilege they
pay handsomely. The advent of Zimmerman will quicken
the pulse of the would-be cyclist, and once the fever
catches on, Australia, like England and America, will
meet with a cycling boom. In London, last Easter Mon-
day, 20,000 cyclists dashed through Kingston-on-Thames.

October. Corbett is said to have been having ‘ rather
too good a time,’ and looks flabby. It is any odds the
Yankee wriggles out of the match before the four months
are up. If he fights, it may be the fight of his life.” And
a Corbett man sends along this extract from an American
paper; "Captain Glori, who managed Fitzsimmons until
recently, says; 1 When I saw Fitz, last in Baltimore about
a week ago he was looking like a wreck. His cheeks were
thinned down. His eyes were sunken. He had a glassy
stare, and he walked in a shambling style. In his present
condition he would not last a round with Sullivan, to say
nothing of Corbett. I tell you Fitz. has aged five years in
the last six months, and if he does not change his manner
of living he will never step into the ring with Corbett-
much less fight him successfully. He is simply living too
fast. That is all there is about it.’ ”

THE BIRDS WHISTLED “ THE DEAD
MARCH.”
“ Even the birds on the trees learned to whistle the
‘ Dead March.’ ”
It was an old soldier who was talking. “We
were in camp,” he said “ in a flat, malarious part
of the country. Our Colonel was a splendid
fighter, hut didn’t appear to have any idea of
sanitary matters. Just then we were in more
danger from disease than from the enemy. Pre-
sently fever broke out and men died by the dozen.
Hardly a day but we buried some of them in the
swamp. In fact, we played the ‘ Dead March ’
so often that I used to fancy the birds in the trees
had learned to whistle it. ‘Awful sorry, you
know, hoys,’ said our Colonel, ‘ but so long as we
have to stay here, we can’t help having the fever,’
Yet the Colonel was wrong, as another regiment
camped near us almost wholly escaped. But their
commander fought the malaria with sanitation
and preventive medicine. That made the differ-
ence.’'
In January, 1892, the influenza was epidemic at
Stebbing, near Chelmsford. Among the persons
attacked were Mrs. Abram Thorogood, of White
House farm, her daughter Annie, and her sons
William and Ernest. They had terrible pains in
the head, sore muscles and joints, and were very
feverish. The whole four —mother and three
children—were confined to their beds.
In a letter on the subject Mr. Thorogood says :
“ My wife became quite delirious; she did not
know where she was, and could neither get in nor
out of bed. I gave Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup to all of them with excellent results ; the
fever soon left them, and shortly they were well
and strong as ever, and have since remained so.
I may mention that many neighbours and friends
had the same complaint as my wife and family,
but although the others had doctors and the best
attention and advice, none recovered so rapidly as
my people did. I thank God that I came to hear
of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, for although
we are a family of seven, living at home, during
the eight years I have kept it in the house we
have not needed a doctor, thus saving many
pounds in doctors’ bills and costly prescriptions.
“ The way I first used Seigel’s Syrup was this :
In the spring of 1883 I began to feel ill and out of
sorts. My tongue was dreadfully coated and a
thick phlegm covered my gums and teeth. After
eating I suffered from pain at the chest and
stomach. I had bad nights, and sweat so much
that in the morning my underclothing was soaked
with moisture. In the following August carbuncles
came on the back of my neck, on my nose, and on
my cIiggIc-Idoiig. Wh£it X suiFGrGd. I c&imot qgs-
cribe. I got so low and weak that I could barely
crawl about. The doctors did me no good. And
as for their physic I might as well have taken tea
or water. In pain and suffering I lingered on
until I heard, through a neighbour, of Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup and got a bottle from Mr.
W Linsell, grocer, of Stebbing. A few doses
relieved me, and soon the carbuncles disappeared,
and I was as well as ever. Yours truly, (Signed)
Abram Thorogood, White House Farm, Steb-
bing, by Chelmsford, August 19th, 1892.
In Mr. Thorogood’s own case the disease was
indigestion and dyspepsia, which poisoned his
blood and caused the carbuncles, which are
growths on the underlying layers of the skin,
After the Syrup had purified his blood they were
absorbed and expelled from the system. Ihe
effect of the remedy in the cases of the other
members of his family shows (what we have often
stated) viz., that influenza attacks those whose
blood is filled with the poisonous acids thrown into
the system by fermented food in the stomach. Mr.
Thorogood says his wife had been troubled with
indigestion and dyspepsia, which was no doubt
the case with the children also. Don t allow your
blood to become a breeding-ground of disease.
On the first signs of Indigestion take Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup. You know the prove-b
about the ounce of prevention.

Sydney Grundy wrote a furious letter to London D.T.
ftnent the hypocrisy of managers who made a virtue of
suppressing O.W.’s name whilst continuing to produce
his plays. “ If a man is not to get the credit of the good
things he has done, how ca i he logically be punished for
his misdeeds ?” Grundy reproving Grundy 1
Pro.: “Technically speaking, without being offensive
to anybody, it is miserable to see a comedian like Wilfred
Shine degraded to F. M. Clarkism. Ye stage-struck
amateurs, what are you working for in damnable Poverty
Pointeration? Melb. is replete with Romeos and Juliets.
Yet Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, and all that crowd, with
Ophelias and Lady Constances by the dozen, have to
whine for a few coppers from the glorious Gaieties.
“The troupe has a chorus of 50 vices.”— Misprint.
A well-known Melb. lady musical professional, left
destitute, with a large family, by her husband s death,
two years ago, prospers at Mildura, curing raisins.
Louis Bradfleld wishes it distinctly understood that he
has not, for any length of time, been understudy to
Roberts ; but he was to Fred Leslie. This is a very sore
point with Bradfleld.
An elderly gentleman in the stalls of a Melb. theatre
had on a close-fitting skull-cap, which a lady, who sat
behind, asked him to take off. “Oh, certainly,” he
replied, removing the cap and exposing an egg-bald head.
“ When I put this on,” he said, “I thought it could not
possibly obscure anyone’s view.” “Never mind, old
chap,” remarked a friend next him, “she would have
asked you to shave your head if it were necessary.”
“Hi! Hi!” was the song which provided material for
Cissy Loftus’s imitation of Letty Lind, at the time when
Cissy was a London rage. In due course Letty got level
with the saucy minx by singing the genuine “Hi! Hi! ”
and then giving her own imitation of the spurious article,
as an encore. She mimicked Cissy’s mimicry and showed
how much it had differed from the original Lind.
Henry Arthur Jones gave 50 guineas to a fund in aid of
the widow of Henry Herman, his “Silver King” collabo-
rateur. Jones and Herman parted company whilst their
drama was booming—each co-author claiming the larger
amount of credit for its success—but the flourishing sur-
vivor has not outlived all sense of indebtedness to his old
pard.
“ John-k-Dreams” (writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent) made a triumphant re-entry at London Hay-
market and went splendidly, with Mrs. Tree as Kate
Cloud vice “Mrs. Pat.” The house was full, and, of
course, Beerbohm Tree made a speech. Haddon Chambers
was all smiles.
Luscorabe Searelle has secured Hall 6 and wife (Norman-
Neruda) for a tour in South Africa. He paid £lOOO down
as caution-money, and Hall 6 and wife in return insured
their lives for the same amount in favor of Searelle, to
secure him against loss in the event of the death of either
of them. This is a new kind of security in theatrical
matters, though common enough in other business.
William Archer, the English dramatic critic, claims to
have read every play worth reading published in the
English language.
“ The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ” is another specimen of
dramatic anti-climax. For three acts Pinero is as brave as
you please—though he does truckle to the gallery when
Mrs. C. yells and grabs the Bible from the fire. In the
fourth act, as usual, the parson influence comes out on
top, and the lady, instead of walking off with her affinity,
goes away to pray for him. As the lady started as a
secularist leoturess, and has all along vented her disgust
at conventional morality, this strikes Mrs. Grundy as most
appropriate.
Re the nauseous tomfoolery of presenting Oscar Wilde’s
plays to the public with his name conspicuously absent
from the programme. A London paper to hand states
that Mr. Alexander resolved to continue the run of “The
Importance of Being Earnest,” rather than close the St.
James’s Theatre and throw his company out of work
(considerate man 1), but was careful to remove O.W. from
all announcements. The paragraph further mentions
that “ the name of the author of ‘ An Ideal Husband
has for some days been withdrawn from the bills at the
Haymarket.” From an adjacent par. in the same
Journal it seems that the run of “An Ideal
finished at the Hay market (because the lessee s
tenancy had expired) amidst general enthusiasm,
“ the curtain being raised no less than seven
times.” The public, in fact, were so fond of the
disgraceful person’s dramatic work that it was promptly
reproduced at another theatre, under the same condi-
tions as before. In all directions entrepreneur Podsnap,
whilst coining money by O.W.’s talent, was waving his
moral paws and declining to know that an O.W. existed
anywhere in the world. At the Lyceum Theatre, New
York, a male management followed the Hinglish example.
A lady, however, preferred to deal fairly with the
difficulty. Rose Coghlan was touring the Western Slates
as “A Woman of No Importance,” and she acknowledged
the author’s right to recognition by dropping his play
from her repertory.
The gods to the fore again 1 On last night of the
“Shop Girl,” at Melb. Princess’s, the gallery howled for
Louis Bradfleld to sing “ Some do it this Way.” Brad-
field came forward and said he was sorry he couldn t sing
it as the music had gone on to Adelaide ; whereupon a
hoy aloft called out, “I’ll whistle it for you 1 ’’
| JMay YohS has left London Avenue, writes The Bulle-
tin’s correspondent, and her part as Handy Dick Whitting-
ton is being taken by Millie Hylton. There seems a doubt
as to whether Lady May quarrelled with Greet, or lost her
voice ; anyhow, there has been a severance, much to the
prejudice of the theatre bookings, though Millie Hylton
is quite as clever as the duchess in posse. But there is
something very fetching about May, in spite of her em-
phatic language and funny ways. How she can objurgate.
No bargee is in it with her, for the ordinary vocabulary of
the River below bridge is, in her case, supplemented by
the latest West End swear-words.
Frances Saville has been singing with great success in
Paris in " Paul et Virginie.” She has fallen off a little
in looks of late, writes Tub Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, and has lost, I am sorry to say, at least a little
of her charming sprightliness. Her voice is brilliant and
her acting good, but she will never be a Melba. Apropos
Ada Orossley’s impending London debut, there is a
splendid opening for a contralto in England now, and if
Miss C. sings half as well as her friends say she can, she is
bound to be at the top of the tree ere long.
At Melb. Theatrical Carnival, Florence Morton, of the
Princess’ chorus, was offered by an elderly johnny who
had spent a lot of money—half a sov. for permission to
kiss her hand. The beauteous one promptly told him he
had fooled away quite enough money and had better go
home. But he persisted so far as to give the half-sov. for
an I O U allowing him to kiss the hand at an unspecified
future date. “Mostly fools.’’
Young Dorrington, of the B. and B. Co., ought to have
talent for the stage—son of the Kendals, and nephew of
Tom Robertson. His appearance and mannerisms are
reminiscent of his handsome father, so his brains prob-
ably come from the maternal side. Human beings, to a
considerable degree, are like watches. The parent chiefly
responsible for the case has least to do with the works.
Oscar Wilde might have said that, but his career was cut
short before it occurred to him. So it has been left to
the present writer.
Marshall Hall’s latest fad, the Melb. Conservatoire
sounded the knell of hope for many struggling loca
musicians. The promoters flatter themselves that, as its
terms are high, they cannot be accused of competing with
outsiders. As a matter of fact, though a single subject
at the Conservatoire is a little more expensive than else-
where, there are several branches included in a “course,
which may be taken up without extra cost. For example,
it is a better speculation to take up a “course ” embrac-
ing, perhaps, singing, violin and harmony, not to speak
of the honor and glory, than to pay Signor Screechi two
guineas less lor singing alone.
Brodribb-Irving’s tinsel title befits the professional
tinsel-wearer. The man who struts the stage a king may
as well strut a knight in private life. There is comfort
in the theory that Irving takes his “honor” merely as
another bogus jewel. It would be pity were it otherwise,
for Irving can honestly claim to have dignified the theatri-
cal profession of his country. In his chief capacity of
manager he ranks as the founder of modern scenic
magnificence and historical accuracy. His productions
have educated the public taste and compelled
rival managers to study those small details which
the old-school showman never gave a thought
to. Also, Irving has raised the standard of payment
for stage hands, supernumeries, and all connected
with theatre business. He is the Lord Bountiful of the
profesh, the leader of every worthy movement for its
individual or collective benefit, and a lavish distributor of
the cash which talent and fortunate circumstances have
brought to his treasury. Sassiety started to run after
Irving twenty years ago, or more. Other actors have
run after sassiety, but the “great Henry’s” worst
enemy wouldn’t accuse him of snobbishness. He was
willing to enter Mayfair mansions as a representative
friend of the drama, not otherwise, and when he entered
he took the drama with him. He didn’t leave it outside
on the mat.
The art of combining fanciful, charming
and pretty designs in brilliant jewellery with
prices which bring these novelties quite within the
reach of people of moderate means, is well under-
stood by Messrs. Hicks. Atkinson & Sons, late
Moubray, Rowan and Hicks, Collins-st., Mel-
bourne. With the .approach of the season they
have imported a number of new and attractive
ornaments for the hair, such as crescents, stars,
tiaras, and coronets; also, the new brilliant
buttons now so much in demand. These decidedly
new goods, though handsome and refined, are very
moderate in cost, and afford an interesting display
for inspection.
The Rev. Langham, a 37-years’ laborer in
the Eijian vineyard, writes exultiugly that in 25
years the Gospel has done away “ with cannibal-
ism, widow-strangling, polygamy, infanticide and
the burying alive of aged and worn-out relatives,”
but adds, with true parsonical fatheadedness;
“yet the natives are fast dying out, from some
cause or other, which no one seems to be able to
explain.” Hideous mockery ! The “ History of
of the Gospel in Fiji ” might be written thus :
Parson baptises nigger, nigger puts on tweed coat
(no pants), prays violently, sweats profusely,
coughs, dies, buried. Exit nigger. Parson writes
a book on Gospel triumphs. To a nigger, Clothes
spell Death.

There is the usual racial antipathy between
Hi Yah, from China, and the Australian abori-
ginal chief, Billy the Bull, who met him on a
bridge, the other day. Billy : “ Hoo-ki, yalla-
binjie ! ” Hi: “No savee.” Billy; “ Gibbit a
couple-a-ohillin.” Hi: “No havvee.” Billy:
“Gibbit sixpen.” Hi : “Me no catchee siccapen.”
Billy; “Well, dammit, gibbit pew matches.”
Hi; “Me no smokee, no cally matchee.” Billy
(getting truculent): “Wad are yer ? ” Hi : “Me
all-a-same Ing-glis-man.” Billy (seizing him) :
“Big peller lie thad one. (Shaking him). You’re
nod a blagpeller (second shake), you’re nod a wide
peller (third and extra-violent shake) ; yurra
plurry harf-cask ! ” And then our countryman
threw the yellow heathen into the river.
“ A Jew on Jews ” writes The Bulletin :
“ We, of all people, should be Anarchists,
Nihilists, Socialists, anything but Royalists.
Longinus says that love of money is the disease
which renders us most pitiful and grovelling; and
this love of money, is, perhaps, the main reason
that, wherever is royalty, or its representatives,
there will you find the Hebrew pushing his way
to the front to join in the grovel; whether it is
Baron Hirsch, juggling his glittering millions to
dazzle the eyes of European royalties, or the
Cohens, Raphaels, and Mosses of the colonies
rushing to Governors’ levees. When Glasgow
held his initial levies, in the Maoriland cities, a
perusal of the visitors’ lists would have led one
to imagine that at least 50 per cent, of the popu-
lation were Hebrews, whereas there are only
about 5000 Jews in the whole country. The
bitterest invective against democracy and demo-
cratic governments emanates from the Hebrews.
If Isaac A. Isaacs, democratic Solicitor-General
for Victoria, were to stand for East Melbourne,
where Jews most do congregate, against a pluto-
cratic representative of the white-vested interests,
the strongest opposition he would have to fight
against would come from the Hebrew electors.”

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “ Alkaline Vitality Pills,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alfaline Pills also
cured my wife and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus ; To Herr Rassmussen. —Dear Sir, - 1 think it my duty tc
inform you that a course of your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, R. A. LU Civil AM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb,, July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmcn
I do most heartily wish you.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Great Debility and Weakness Cured.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated —
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

The late disclosures of the rottenness of
the N.Y. police system recall the fact that not
long ago the Argus urged that a mission should
be sent to New York for the purpose of getting
hints for the remodelment of the Vic. force.
A Melbourne paper apologises :
We are happy to state, after making the fullest inquiry,
that not only was our information of the most exaggerated
character, but that the actual facts were not true.
A newspaper’s “actual fact ” is often a lie-and-a-
half.
A howl comes from the West re the im-
perfect state of Bibles used for taking the oaths
in Never-Never courts of justice. How on earth
can a man take a valid oath on a Bible containing
perhaps only a half of Malachi, a quarter of
Exodus, and, mayhap, none of Jonah?
Dr. Faust’s Specific for coughs, colds and
kindred complaints wants to come under the
notice of people with barks and whoops, and
assures the public that it will give speedy relief
for the comparatively small sum of two-and-six.
The large, gross citizen who can t get
through his own front door unless his wife pulls
him by the waistcoat and his family push him
with several horsepower at the small of his back,
is requested by advertisement to notice that Dr.
Steinmeyer’s Pills, though guaranteed perfectly
harmless, will give him back his long-lost “ fig-
,ger” in a trice. The stout female who loads
down the omnibus is also implored to consider
the error of her weighs.
Bishop Webber (Q.) asserts that he would
be ready to beg again in England to-morrow,
arguing justification on the ground that most of
the profits of Queensland stations go to English
spenders who pay Australia neither Land-tax nor
Income-tax. The local Labor-party should be
grateful to the Bishop for keeping these ugly facts
under the public eye. But, on the other hand, is
it not presumption on his reverence’s part to say
that the money which the Q. Govt, culpably
neglects to collect should be raked into his own
pocket ?
When Maoriland Govfc. first proposed to
lend money cheaply on mortgage, the local Tory
press pointed out that the State would inevitably
lend too much, in order to gratify supporters and
placate hungry politicians, and there would be a
frightful loss when it came to realise on the
security, ;and the Loan Department would
burst up, and the Treasury would go bankrupt,
and the London money-market would be dis-
turbed, and capital would be withdrawn from the
country. Now it transpires that the State
demands a larger margin than do private bor-
rowers, and the Tory press states that this undue
conservatism will ruin the business, and urges the
department to launch out and “plunge.” It is
difficult to satisfy some people.
Dear Btjlleein, —Me that Q. fairy-story of
the snake crawling up the shunter’s arm. On
Frankston (Vic.) line, some years ago, guard Tom
Ward was holding the lever for the passenger-
train, and as it approached noticed the engine
letting off water. He called out, but couldn’t
make himself heard, and so stood and received the
full force of the boiling water and steam. As it
was night-time he was unnoticed at first, but on
being missed search was made and he was found
at the points, scalded to insensibility. _ It took
him months to recover, his clothes having to be
out off him.—W.S.W.

RESTORED TO HEALTH
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Gumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer's Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier known.”

Dear Bulletin, —It has come. We have
educated the intruding alien. Some men camped
near Bourke, N.S.W., were surprised the other
day by an Afghan, who in tolerable English, en-
quired, “You men look for work?” Chorus of
“Yes.” “ I want a few post-holes sunk in my
yard,” continued the man of camels; “anyone
sink ’em, I give him rations.” Dead silence. But
at night two young fellows sneaked away, and re-
turned the following (Sunday) night with their
bags filled. They had sunk the post-holes.—6 xB.

One of the deadest and gonest of Mel-
bourne institutions is the annual Yorkshire
dinner, which passed away with the halcyon
period. It was a gathering of fine, big men of
Yorkshire birth or descent—railway Speight, ex-
Mayor Dodgshun, Horsfall, Parker, Dick Rowe
and Clough of the wool-trade, Vasey, the Gas Co.
potentate, and many another solid tyke. Good
digestion waited on good appetite at the Yorkshire
dinner. There were no flies on the grub, no heel-
taps in the glasses, and the company, which num-
bered about 150, had a larger aggregate heart than
any other Melbourne company on record. This
latter circumstance hastened the sad end of the
Yorkshire dinner, no doubt. One or two of the
chief supports gave way, a lot of the minor lights
were snuffed out, and over went the show. But,
though dead, it is not forgotten.

When Melbourne biz. was booming
And Gillies bossed the State,
Nor recked of trouble looming;
When Syme with Dicky Speight
Was still a warm “ chin-chinner ’*
And rents were awful dear,
A famous Yorkshire dinner
Was gobbled once a year.
Alas ! for “Yorkshire’s” dinner —
When fat times dwindle thinner
Such pleasures disappear.
No entrees, jellies, ices,
Or kickshaw trifles vain—
York ham, served up in slices
(Twas fried in dry champagne).
Roast-beef, with Yorkshire puddin’,
And heaps of heavy fare;
The cheese was proved a good ’un
By all the heroes there.
But, whilst they sat at dinner,
The saint upon the sinner
Was feasting everywhere.
Then banks and bankers busted
And high-time prices fell,
And saints, once blindly trusted,
Got tickets through to h —1.
To-day those burly diners
Have mostly tasted woe—
Their fairy golden shiners
Have melted like the snow.
And when some story-spinner
Refers to “ Yorkshire dinner ”
Their tears in silence flow.

Anent the Central Queensland G.M. Proprie-
tary 00., and the criticism passed upon its properties in a
recent issue by “An OldQ. Miner,"Mr. HenryOruickshank,
the oo.’s secretary, now takes up the parable. Mr. Oruiok-
shauk adds his emphatic testimony to that of Mr. Sachs
(whose initials, by the way, are L.F., and not J. 0., as
printed).
“I know,” says Mr. 0., “every inch of the
freehold property, my duties as secretary necessitating
two visits of inspection extending over 10 months. I
have had the opportunity of obtaining properly authen-
ticated particulars— viva voce—ot the immense amount of
gold taken from N.Z. Gully in the days of the first rush
from a number of ‘Old Q. Miners,’ who, unlike your cor-
respondent, remained in the district for 30 years, having
secured competencies the nucleus of which was found in
N.Z. Gully.
“ The matter stands briefly thus N.Z. Gully
and the reefs in the Boyne Range feeding it are the pro-
perties of two syndicates (who combine for purposes of
flotation in England).' The shareholders include honoured
residents of three provinces. For exactly two years
solid prospecting work has been done at considerable ex-
pense on the freehold containing the historical N.Z.
Gully. Nearly 100 shafts—in the ‘ gutter ’ and wide of it
—were put down ; and it has been demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the shareholders that the entire Gully
carries Sufficient payable gold to warrant sluicing on a
large scale.
“ Under the auspices of the Gladstone Chamber
of Commerce an inspection was recently made by three
old residents of the district miners of admitted
experience. They made the following sworn declara-
tion;^- 1 We are well-known old residents of this dis-
trict, and have no interest whatever in the above pro-
perty, eil her directly or indirectly, examining it solely
wjth the view of securing an independent report of
its value. ,We are of opinion that the entire Gully
systematically sluiced on a face will average at
least six pennyweights of gold to the load.’
This testimony is supported by a gentleman who has lived
for over to years in the Port Curtis district, and is now its
representative in Q. Parliament. Further support to the
of the reports is given by the president of the
Chrtmbyr of Commerce and Mayor of Gladstone. I, per-
sonally. firmly believe the property will, immediately
afWr the neo ssary machinery is erected, produce an
annual output of gold second to no mining property in
Queensland.
“ We are advised by competent hydraulic en-
gineers that two ‘ Monitor ’ nozzles will break down and
sluice over 2000 loads per diem. The gully—like all
auriferous alluvial deposits—is patchy, running from
many ounces to a few grains per load. The declared aver-
age is 6dwts. ; but, to be perfectly safe, the bulk yield is
out down by two-thirds. The cost of treatment as
furnished us is 4£d. per load ; but we have endeavoured
to be on the sure side by estimating the expenses at Is.
per load. We have an unlimited water-supply; and
allowing for wear and tear, and costs of two sets of pump-
ing plant, the weekly expense is covered by £220, treat-
ing, say, 10,000 loads. Three grains to the load would,
therefore, leave a profit. It is utter nonsense in these
days of gigantic mining undertakings, and particularly
with a property like the Central Queensland G.M. Pro-
prietary's—possessing a multitude of untried reefs and
millions of loads of payable gravel—to accept the experi-
ences of ‘ A i Old Q. Miner,’ who, 30 years ago, worked
without profit a piece of ground in N.Z. Gully 20 feet
square! It is Well-known that thousands of diggers were
unsuccessful. What ‘ rush ’ has there been but provided
victims? It is notorious that Mount Morgan, at the date
of ‘An Old Q. Miner’s ’ brief stay in the district, was
‘ napped ’ and tried by numberless fossickers ; but 20 x 20
feet of ironstone worked with pestle and mortar and a
dish had no attraction in those days, neither, for the
matter of that, would it prove very remunerative at the
present day,
“What qualifications has ‘An Old Q. Miner’
for parading his estimate of 2grs. to the load for river-
dredging, or what reason for his denunciation of the reefs
wherf it la taken into consideration that no dredge ever
worked on the River, nor were reefs opened out in his
day—or, indeed, for many years after? The reefs alto-
gether have merely had most primitive trials. Take the
Alexandra. It was literally ‘scooped’ out like a deep
ditch to a depth of 70 feet, and the stone roughly crushed,
Some 300 tons averaged 3oz. to the ton ; then mundic was
struck, and the crude gold-saving appliances were unable
to deal with it. I could give you assays and tests ex-
tending over the last two years; but really there is no
necessity for this. They merely concern the share-
holders. ‘An Old Q. Miner’commences his letter: ‘ You
ad vertise the prospectus,’ &c. Now, you do nothing of
kind. No prospectus has been advertised of the
Ge,ltral Queensland G.M. Proprietary-this being only
distributed privately to the immediate connections of the
ori e inal shareholders. All the shares (6144) are now
allot ted, and our reserve-fund for future developments is
ln hard cash > veBted in trustees. Your advertising
columns contained no invitation for the general public to
subscribe, but merely a special notice of interest
only to those who received the private prospectus.

—let alone 30 miles—makes considerable difference in the
value of a raining property. On the authority of the

“ Well?”
“It’s this way,” continued Tom, with the air of

The Tantanoola tiger has now been seen
for the 98th time in S.A. by a man who “could
have shot the animal,” but his gun was not loaded,
and (also) he had forgotten to take it with him.
A comparison of the descriptions given on the
several occasions the tiger has been seen produces
wonderful results. The tiger is apparently a cow-
shaped beast, with blue, green, and yellow spots;
it has three different tails, respectively 10ft., 12ft.,
and 60ft. long; and one reliable citizen, who has
lived at Tantanoola for 30 years, and was once a
fisherman and detective, and can therefore be be-
lieved, says the tiger has three ears and two horns,
the latter “four times the size of an ordinary
cow’s,” and barks like a dog. Another citizen,
who was at the battle of Waterloo, says the
animal he saw had a head like a big dog and a tail
like a crocodile, and, when he saw it, was breath-
ing stertorously out of its eyes, but it is believed
that this was a mirage, arising from “local”
whisky. :
Premier Reid: “God made a plan of
human progress long before any white man came
to this continent. What was this vast ocean
between all countries for? It gave human beings
the facilities for carrying on an enormous com-
merce.” Which is reminiscent of the Scotch rail-
road engineer who said that the Lord made the
hills because otherwise there would be no places
to make tunnels through. Some people have
ventured the opinion that the ocean was intended
as a means of supplying rain, so that man might
have a shower-bath in the morning, but Reid
knows better. At the same time The Bulletin
always feels like throwing a lump of mud at the
little podgy individual who is on such intimate
terms with the Almighty that he knows the exact
reason for everything.
Maoriland papers complain that, away
back at a solitary place called Rangatira, near
Paraekaretu, the cemetery is unfenced, and the
pigs root out deep holes with a view to getting at
the coffins and gnawing the dead. Bacon must
be a solemn kind of food at Rangatira, away down
by Paraekaretu. Bacon, by the way, is a solemn
article of diet anywhere. Consider, for instance,
that awesome pig-story which dune from the
N.S.W. back-blocks a year or two ago. A hope-
lessly drunken bushman, so drunk that the resur-
rection wouldn’t have roused him, was sleeping in
the paddock behind a bush pub; and three pigs
ate —but the rest of that pig story is merely a
quantity of shudders. And when the pigs had
finished rooting the- remains of the slumbering
object over the place, they left it in the vicinity of
an ant-hill, and the ants , Anyhow, it was
found an hour later and removed to the hospital,
and even the nurse fled from that still-living object
in insane terror.
Re “ the violent and slanderous language
of professional demagogues,” it is remarked by
the respectable G. R. Sims that “Even Mr. John
Burns, a member of Parliament and a London
County Councillor, recently denounced our brave
soldiers as ‘ gilded popinjays.’ ” “ Brave soldiers ”
is a Tory gag all the world over, and law’n’orderites
who have it on the tips of their tongues are the
loudest scoffers at its Radical counter-phrase—
“ Honest working men.” Yet, one may more
reasonably assume the honesty of a hard-
working craftsman than the bravery of a
nursemaid-mashing soldier. Army-recruits don’t
take the shilling because they are naturally
valorous, any. more than second sons of lords
obtain officers’ commissions with a view of
getting shot, nor is a barracks’ life calculated to
develope special pluck. Brave miners, railway-
hands, cattle-yarders, sailors, steeple-jacks, &c.,
if you like—but not “brave soldiers.” Soldiers!
who have been ordered into smoky action half a
dozen times are less inured to danger than thou-
sands of working men who face a palpable risk of
death, in cold blood, six days a week all the year
round. Moreover, an enormous majority oLthe
world’s professional fighters get through amilitary
career without fighting at all. At the present
time there are very few privates in the French
army, and positively none in the German, who
have tasted “glory.” Leaving little wars with
colored races out of the question, there is hardly a
Frenchman, German or Britisher in the ranlfs
possessing any claim to the term “ brave soldier*”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I walked the verandah of my bungalow on Moto
Ko Buli plantation, Sarawaga river, island of
Vanua Levu, Fiji, impatiently waiting dinner.
It was longer than usual in coming, and more
than once I had shouted to Lonea, the cook, to
hurry up, receiving always the stereotyped
answer, “ To, saka, malua vakalailaie /” (“Yes,
sir, wait a little.”).
Suddenly, after a longer pause than usual,
Lonea pounced on to the verandah in a state of
wild excitement. His eyes flamed and his breath
came fast as he asked :
“ Did you eat any of your curry, sir ?”
“ Eat any of the curry ! How could I when
you haven’t given me a chance? But, see here,
my friend, if it isn’t on the table smartly, by the
Lord I’ll eat you ! ”
Utterly disregarding the terrible threat, Lonea
only rapped out, with rising anger, “Then it’s
some of those niggers” (using the last
epithet of contempt one “nig.” can hurl at
another).
“ What’s that? What have they been up to?”
“ Eaten your curry ! Come and see.”
Now this was a serious matter, and with an
energetic “The devil they have!” I followed
Lpnea to the vale ni kuro. There, sure enough,
stood the dish of curry that would in its perfect
state have adorned my table and progressed
gently through my digestive apparatus—but what
a wreck !
Half the contents of dismembered fowl had
disappeared, and in the rampart of rice by which
it had been surrounded there were the unmistake-
able marks of the thievish fingers which had made
free with the greater portion. My dinner was
spoiled.
“ Who did this ?” I asked, wrathfully.
“ I don’t know, sir; but one of those Ra
men, I think.”
“Were they about here?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Who?”
“Masid, Taniela, Warri, Tioni, Radovo and
Taviuni.”
“ Any in the kitchen ?”
“Not while I was here, sir.”
“ Well, you go to their bare and tell them all
to muster on the verandah at once, if they don’t
want me after them; and send me your chief,
Rogo.”
Tanna men are true as steel in a fight. They
will stand to you like white men. Rogo came
and quickly took my instructions, and I then
went to make my own preparations for dealing
with the culprit among the Ra men ; for this
offence, combining theft, sacrilege and insult, had
to be promptly avenged.
The Ra men were not long in answering the
summons, and, having strapped on my revolver,
I lined them up against the rail.
All were there ; twenty bronze figures perfectly
nude but for the sulu around the loins.
Then Rogo and his ten Tanna men, fully armed,
quietly appeared and took up a position at a little
distance; so that when I began my harangue on
the enormity of the offence committed, and ex-
pressed my determination to discover and punish
the culprit, the Ra men felt I was in earnest.
I told them white men had means of detection
about which ignorant Ra Viti knew nothing, and
that I was bound to find out the thief. Of course,
all loudly protested innocence and denounced the
offender.
Then the stance commenced.
I first went down the line looking for curry
sign, making each one open his mouth. The draw
was not altogether a blank, but it afforded no
positive proof.
“ Now,” I said, “ I am going to show you how
a white man finds out a thief, and woe to him who
tells me lies.”
Then, commencing at the first man, I clapped
my hand on his bare chest, over his heart, and
sharply asked, “Did you eat my curry?”
“ Segai, saka, au bubului ki na Ka/ou dina an
sega ni kunia.” (No, sir ; I swear by the true God
I didn’t.”)
“Did you? Did you? Did you?” and the
answer was repeated all down the line, while the
heart-beat under my hand was but normal.
Then I came to Taviuni (so-called because he
had long lived on the island of that name). “Did
you ?”
“ No, I swear— ” but the thump, thump, thump
of his heart under my hand told a different story,
changing suspicion into certainty, and he turned
the yellowy-white color of dirty fat as I thun-
dered out —“You lie! Here, Lonea, bring me
that bilo.”
Lonea brought the cup in which I had prepared
a gentle dose of ipecacuanha out of the medicine-
chest,
“ Now, drink this !”
At first, Taviuni refused, believing he was to be
poisoned outright; but, by tasting it myself and
showing him the revolver, I at last induced him
to reconsider his decision.
He drank, and we all waited results. Presently
he turned to go.
“ Stop there 1”
“ Au tauveimate, saka ” (‘ I’m unwell, sir ”).
“ All right—stop there.”
“ Au via lua, sakal"
“ All right. Lua where you are !” And—ye
gods—he did 1”
There were one or two premonitory throes ;
then a mighty convulsion of the whole man ; and
—well, everybody soon knew who stole the curry.
The man’s discomfiture was his sufficient punish-
ment ; but the story flow far and wide, and I
became speedily famous as a mighty medicine-
man on the strength of the way in which I bowled
out Master Taviuni.

Alleged extract from a recent speech
delivered in London by Cecil Rhodes :
The only chance for a colony is to stop these {viz.. Pro-

a wise thing to put into the constitution that the tariff
should not exceed the present Cape tariff, which is a
revenue and not a protective tariff. (Hear, hear.) The
proof of that is that we have not a single factory in Cape
Colony.

A young French Judge resigned rather than sen-

Robespierre ! When Lord Melbourne took the

tears until reminded of her prerogative of mercy,
and for over 50 years she has looked calmly on her
troops slaughtering savage races, fighting vainly
for their freedom in various parts of the “glorious
British Empire,” on which the sun never sets,
probably because that luminary believes the deeds
that would be done in the darkness would be far
worse even than those that refuse to bear the
light.
The Canadian Government, in order to
start an export trade in butter and get a firm hold
on the English market, offers to buy up all the
surplus creamery butter in the Dominion for this
season at lOd. per lb., and sort, pack and export it
at the risk of the State. Which, no doubt, comes
under the heading of coddling and grandmotherly
supervision, but then half the world’s big in-
dustries were started by just such coddling. The
Victorian butter-trade was created in that fashion;
and so, practically, was the growing S.A. wine-
export trade. Many of England’s manufactures
began through the Govt, importing foreign
artisans and giving them special privileges and
inducements. The immense French and German
beet-sugar industries were similarly coddled. -The

culture is mainly owing to a fatherly department

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was Saturday night—late. We had spent the
evening in town, wandering from one haunt to
another —you know what that means. So, by this
time, we were in the very best of humors. We
halted unanimously, but quite impromptu, at a
corner, and stood discussing warmly all those
things about which we knew least.
While we were talking a man, whom we had
noticed leaning against the corner lamp-post, sud-
denly left his position, and made towards us.
Abruptly, without even a prefatory cough, he
made this statement:—
“ I’ve had a few to-night. Eighteenpence more
and I could get just like you coves.”
The words imparted a slur upon our sobriety
which was quite unwarranted. But, apart from
this, there was something rather taking about his
manner. He spoke a little anxiously, perhaps,
but without any trace of the whine of the profes-
sional mendicant, and had, on the whole, the air
of one who was simply giving information likely
to be received with interest.
Naturally, we hesitated a little, and, I am
afraid, even had the bad taste to allow our hesita-
tion to be seen. For he went on meditatively to
add this deduction by way of further inducement:
“ Sixpence a head is what it ’ud cost yous, if
yous ’ud do it. ’Tain’t much.”
Then, interested, of course, but never obtru-
sively so, he stood waiting.
Well, hang it all, you know sixpence is not
much ; and if it would really make him so happy
it would be well spent. So we collected and gave
him the eighteenpence.
He said : “ I’ll think of you all when I’m drink-
ing it.” Then, to show his absolute good faith, he,
turned straightway into the bar of the corner
hotel.

“ The people here are a good sort, I can tell
you, a very superior lob indeed. By dress or
occupation you can’t tell whom you address until
they open their mouths.”— Letter from Coolgardie.
Hoolan is very rough on New Australia in
the Mundic Miner. According to John Plumper
the fundamental principle of New Australia is
that “ the last man collars the lob ” —a denouement
which he prophesies is not far off. “ The move-
ment originated with one man, and will end with
one man,” is John’s final prediction.
A Victorian youth, the other day, went off
his head with religious mania, and decided to
offer up the old man as a burnt sacrifice. Accord-
ingly, he built an altar in a paddock, and got the
fuel ready with which to frizzle his progenitor, and
then he went into the house with a wild expression
in his eye, and invited the father out for a walk.
As he wouldn’t come, the young man proceeded to
mash him with a crowbar, and also made a great
effort to shove him into the kitchen grate, bub the
fond parent got him down after a breezy fight, and
secured him with a clothes-line. This is another
tragedy which the Bible-in-schools party can’t
well put down to a “godless education.”
