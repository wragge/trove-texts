The Red Page
Australian
Drama
The Australian Drama (which isn’t) per-
sists in print. Montague Grover publishes
The Minus Quantity and Other Short Plays
(The Theatre Magazine, Sydney, Is.).
And worth it. The five short plays range
from the surfragette humor of “The Minus
Quantity,’” originally published in The
Lone Hand, through the emotional moments
of “The Traitress” (A shot sounds and he
falls back into- the r00m ....), and the melo-
drama of “The Boomerang” ( Earle frees
himself from Helen and fires. The man
falls, moaning ....), and of “The Return of
Hagar” {The nurse rushes forward: Hoyte
falls back... .“Twenty years ago he stole a
human soul; I called to collect”), to the
genuine drama of “The Human Document.”
“The Minus Quantity”—which is clothes
—is not meant to be produced, since the
stage direction requires “a thousand spec-
tators on the beach, and hundreds of- bathers
shooting the breakers,” also the services of
a property wave which “lifts Beryl up and
pitches, her right on top of Jimmy, nearly
drowning him,” and subsequently sends
Beryl “scuttling 30 yards towards the
beach.” It is a pleasant short story—in its
right place in a collection of short stories.
In “The Human Document” Montague
Grover has written a play. Zack Brown, a
dealer in old wares —and stolen goods—was
sent to gaol by Detective McMurtrie for
three years. When the play opens Zack
sees the chance of paying McMurtrie back.
Chook Pengelly, a thief, arrives with a
stolen locket, which he sells to Zack. Zack
gets his daughter to light the fire under the
crucible that he keeps handy for melting
down inconvenient golden ornaments. But
he does not throw the locket in; for Chook
tells him that McMurtrie had searched him
some months before, and finding the locket
on him, had handed it back! Why? His
daughter, Lottie, reasons it out. McMurtrie
is watching Chook to discover where he dis-
poses of his stolen goods. Yes, but... .Lottie
recognises the locket: it was concerned in a
murder case, for which already a man had
been- found guilty and hanged. What was
Chook doing with it? Zack guesses the
missing links....and knows he has the evi-
dence now to send the detective, himself, to
gaol. And the detective arrives.
“You sent me to gaol,” the father says,
“to gaol for three years, when that girl there
was fourteen. Lottie was all I had. I was
crook; I’ve been crook all my life; but
Lpttie’s mother was a straight woman, and
I made up my mind that she’d be the same.
I spent all I had on that girl All I
done was done for that girl, and then you
come along and fit me for some rotten job
and send me up for three years. And when
I come out, where’s Lottie? Where was
you, Lottie?”
Lottie casually remarks, “Madame’s.”
“See how she says it,” says her father,
bitterly. “She’s a good girl at heart —-a
good girl still —but she’s lost one thing. She
don’t look on Madame’s like she would if
she’d been kept away from harm, as she
would have been if I hadn’t got into trouble
—if you hadn’t put me in. You took a
man’s body and made it a machine for three
years; but you did more, you took a woman’s
soul and wrung the sense of right and wrong
out of it and left her the wreck, body and
soul, that she was till her old dad done his
time and come out to look after her again.”
So now he has got McMurtrie. The
detective, finding that locket on Chook, knew
that it belonged to the murdered man, knew
that the other man was not the murderer,
knew that Chook was guilty. Yet he let
that other man be convicted and hanged.
But McMurtrie unconcernedly smokes his
cigar. He admits that he let the wrong
man be hanged. Why? Because the man
who was hanged was a man who infinitely
more deserved to be banged than Chook, the
murderer. He tells the story of the con-
victed man....and Lottie shows a growing
interest. He tells the story of the seduction
of a child of fourteen... .It is Lottie’s story.
That was why McMurtrie hanged him. Her
father cries: “God, I wish you’d given me
the chance to pull the drop.”
It is a telling little play, theatrically
effective, with considerable cleverness in the
construction, a fine “set”.... sure to be seen
soon on some Repertory stage. Which
sounds almost an anti-climax, when there
are so many keen business theatre men
looking everywhere (except in Australia)
for the theatrically effective.
The Trust
Prof. W. Jethro Brown was appointed
on the resignation, through ill-health, of
John Gordon, chairman of the Australian
Sugar Commission—-“the most searching
investigation that has yet been made into
any Australian industry.” The result of
his experiences is the solidly and fairly
written The Prevention- . and Control of
Monopolies (Murray, 65.). Brown defines
a monopoly as existing where, “as a result
of agreement, consolidation or dominant
control, there is an absolute or virtual
abeyance of competition as a factor in the
determination of the price of a commodity
or service.” A trust is “any large consoli-
dated business which enjoys a monopolistic
control”; and a combine is “a union of
several more or less independent concerns
for the purpose of excluding or limiting com-
petition.”
The tendency toward the formation of
monopolies, trusts and combines is the out-
standing feature of modern capitalism.
While it may eliminate the wastes of com-
petition, it deprives the producer, the
employee and the consumer of the protection
which competition has afforded them in the
past. And now, what new safeguard can
be devised? This difficult problem leads
Brown to consider the syndicalist move-
ment, to which he attaches extreme import-
ance. He clearly shows the cardinal differ-
ences between syndicalism and socialism.
“The social unrest of our times arises not
so much from hunger as from thinking.”
And “neither the capitalist, as such, nor the
trade unionist, as such, is the enemy to
society. The enemy to society is the para-
site in the one class, and the revolutionary
extremist in the other... .Both are enemies
to the class to which they belong rather than
to the class to which they are opposed.”
The trust prefers to make its profits out
of high prices to consumers, rather than out
of low wages to employees. Consumers
grumble; but workmen go out on strike.
And between these alternatives the latter
is more dreaded in the policy of trust
finance.
Brown insists that there is no single
remedy against trusts. He mentions and
critically examines the following remedies :
Limitation of the size of corporate busi-
ness ; publicity; legislative regulation and
administrative supervision of competition;
limitation of profits, public regulation of
prices, public competition, and nationalism.
And he finds no one policy adequate to the
conditions which either exist to-day or are
likely to exist in the near future. For one
thing, the economic and political conditions
of various countries are divergent. There
is no easy solution to “the most difficult
problem of our time.” The author believes
that in most industries the maintenance of
competitive industry is theoretically desir-
able and practicable, though he recognises
that monopoly is the natural goal in some
industries. He sees nothing in available
data to justify the assumption that the
whole world of industry is destined to organ-
isation in the trust form: the greater
number of industries will continue to be
carried on by more or less independent con-
cerns. Especially in Australia, where the
increasing rate of wages, and the increasing
difficulty of maintaining the standard of
labor, have given a new encouragement in
certain industries to the small producer. In
these industries, the independent prbduccr,
by the labor of himself and his family,
supplemented it may be by the assistance
of hired labor, is more than able to hold his
own.
Brown does not hope much from the
policy of imposing an arbitrary limit upon
the size of corporate enterprise. But he
does believe in the policy of prohibiting
unfair competition. The big business
should not be attacked simply because it is
big. but it should be made to prove that
its bloatedness is necessary to its efficiency.
For that reason there must be publicity of
its methods. The trust must be compelled
to disclose its profits. For this purpose of
a just publicity the author finds a clear
necessity for a permanent commission to
supervise big business undertakings. Our
permanent tribunal is of little use: it has
so many other things to do. And the Inter-
State Commission should have the power off
giving judicial decisions upon the matters
involved in the definition of unfair competi-
tion, such decisions to be final as to facts.
But publicity has but a limited value. There
must be a policy of monopoly control which
will prevent abuses without imperilling the
standard of efficiency.
Public competition is ruled out as a
remedy for trusts; either we should
nationalise an industry or control it by
other means. Limitation of profits is also
ruled out, except as an integral part of the
policy of the public control of prices. As
regards nationalism, Brown finds certain
industries, dealing, e.g., with transport,
affecting the health of the community, or
the depletion of national resources, that
might be nationalised. But he regards the
nationalisation of monopolies as a policy of
limited application. It is chiefly by the
policy of the public control of prices that
Brown hopes to tame the octopus, assuming
first the adoption of publicity and the public
regulation of competition. If publicity and
public regulation do not render the trust
innocuous, then —nationalise it or control
its prices.
But it has just occurred to us, according
to the Liberal politician and the Liberal
press, there are no trusts in Australia. It
seems a pity that Prof. W. Jethro Brown
bothered.
The War
The Australian cartoonist blushingly
leaves the trenches of the press to attack
the public in the open, Two, Hal Eyre, of
The Daily Telegraph, and D. H. Souter,
of The Stock Journal, proffer collections
of their War Cartoons, price Is. each. Hal
Eyre’s stiff line and pernicketty detail spoil
many oof his bright ideas —and some of his
ideas are not bright. The abortion of a
lion’s head on a sailor’s body, typifying
Britain, is one of his mistakes in artistry,
while his too, too solid angel, with cotton-
wool wings and baggy trousers, can be
excused only by the hurry of daily journal-
ism. His ideas, such as his “Come Over
Here,” from Napoleon on St. Helena to
the Kaiser, and his cheerful Australian tar
putting a feather of the Emden in his cap,
are better than his execution. D. H. Souter’s
budget is a pleasant surprise, since none of
the combatant’s emblems is a black cat, and
he has little chance for filmy draperies or
pleasing feminine curves and the employment
of dress suits where a patch of black is
artistically necessary. Souter’s original ideas
are expressed with originality and a brilliant
craftsmanship. His picture of the Kaiser
choking the Belgian child has the necessary
malignancy; and he has put down, once for
all, the dollar-neutrality of Uncle Sam.
When Unready Sam is asked by armed
Britannia to give satisfactory guarantees re
the exportation of wool to the Neutrited
States, he objects with his usual, “Between
friends” Britannia sternly replies:
“This is business. Sign, please.” “The
Bogey Man” and “The Armed Heel” are
striking cartoons, worthy to rank with the
best of the German cartoons —than which,
alack, there can be no higher praise.
E. George Marks, of Sydney Sun, reprints
(with portrait) a first series of his articles
appearing in that publication, dealing with
Napoleon and the War (J. R. Tyrrell, Syd-
ney, 25.. 6d;). Quotations from The Aus-
tkalian Journalist inform us that the
author is a Napoleonic authority—so that’s
all right. In the preface we learn that
“from a number of Australians, occupying
distinguished positions in the Commonwealth
[names given] Mr: - " Marks received encour-
agement to publish this series” —so that’s
also all right. The articles are good jour-
nalism, aptly seizing upon the briefest of
cablegrams to introduce Napoleon’s head.
Fiction
John Mitchell’s wife, nee Louie Susan
Muix*, ran away from him, and John Mit-
chell pursued her over the globe. He failed
to find her, but does not yet despair. For
he has got “a well-known . author”
to write the true story of the Muir sisters,
with photographs of the originals, in the
guise of a novel. It is entitled Lives of
Romance: a True Novel, by John T. Fran-
cis (Mitchell, London, Is.). By means of
this publicity he hopes to discover the miss-
ing wife, and prosecute her for the recovery
of money and jewellery of his with which
he alleges she absconded. And he offers a
reward of £lOO for her apprehension. Aus-
tralasian readers should be interested in
this curious detective novel, for the parties
are all Australasians. John Mitchell was
in 1895 “one of the best-known _ business
agents in Melbourne,” and the Muir sisters
through him purchased the Otago Hotel in
Flinders-street. They were born at Caver-
sham, Dunedin. John married Louie, “a
fine, tall brunette with grey eyes, and a fine
figure.” According to the author, one of her
sisters married a Hindoo hawker, and
another a M.L. journalist, from whom she
got a divorce and married a well-known and
wealthy Australian station-owner (full
names and photographs supplied by the
obliging author). The married lives of the
sisters are fully described, and the allega-
tions made against the two women are •of
the frankest description. As fiction the book
is negligible; but it is noteworthy as the first
example in literature of an alleged “human
document” used as a detective agency.
Roy Bridges knows how to provide the
average novel of adventure with a local and
historical background. His heroine in The
Fugitive (Hodder and Stoughton) takes the
presumptive guilt of her lover upon her
shoulders, and is transported for murder to
Van Diemen’s Land. In the same ship the
officer in charge of the convicts happens to
be the villain who actually committed the
murder. . The wreck of the convict ship has
the right dash of the gruesome, and the sub-
sequent privations of hero and heroine are
credible enough; but the complication that
comes about owing to the hero being rescued
in a convict’s dress rather strains the reader’s
credulity. But Roy Bridges’ reader will not
mind. She wants adventure and romance,
and will not be disappointed. Bridges, though
his literary work is quite undistinguished,
is to be commended for the consistent use he
makes of our history—a mine of interest too
often regarded as not worth working by the
local author.
Constance Mackness is hereby admitted
to a front seat in the flapperature class. Her
Gem of the Flat (Angus and Robertson,
Sydney; 3s. 6d.) is a pleasant and natural
narrative of the comparatively backblocks, in
which the new school-teacher, the escaped
bushranger, the old gold-miner, and the vari-
ous children of the families at Needy Flat
are presented with an engaging appearance of
real life. The illustration of the novel by
actual photographs of the locality and cha-
racters is well carried out, and the idea is
infinitely preferable to the usual efforts of
the overseas artist to achieve something like
the local color of a place he has never seen.
Ourselves
11. M. Vaughan’s An Australasian
Wander-Year (Seeker, per Dymock’s
Library) is well illustrated and somewhat
entertaining. Vaughan has the usual plea-
sant things to say of Sydney’s ineqm-
parable climate, of surf-bathing, of Sydney’s
Botanical Gardens, and of The Bulletin —
our notorious modesty makes us reluctant to
quote the praise, the more so since there are
references to this little shrinking page, but
the criticism may be pardoned: “....The
facetious and slangy style of expression
which is affected by the regular members of
The Bulletin’s staff. For the journalese
of this weekly paper is like nothing save
itself, since the idioms are not borrowed
either from British or American speech, but
may be regarded as a peculiar brand of
Austral-English. The curious nomenclature,
e.g., ‘Bananaland,’ ‘Big Smoke,’ will cer-
tainly puzzle and irritate the reader in his
early attempts to appreciate The
Bulletin.” Rotorua is “undoubtedly one
of the most fascinating places on the globe” ;
Collins-street is “one of the stateliest streets
in the world, classed in the same category
with Fifth Avenue, the Thames Embank-
ment and the Champs Elysges. Port Jack-
son, however, is not, from the standpoint
of the artist, the most beautiful harbor. Its
shores are too low and too monotonous, and
the commercial development of Sydney has
not allowed much of its original appearance
to survive. Sydney architecture, especially
the incongruous massing of St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, the Town Hall and the Victoria
Markets, comes in for a just condemnation.
Of Sydney citizens, “roughly speaking, the
men are tall, thin and sunburnt; the women
short, plump and rather pallid.” (!)
Smallpox
Judging from the title, The History of
Small-pox in Australia, 1788-1908, compiled
by J. H. L. Cumpston, Commonwealth
Director of Quarantine, small-pox stopped
in Australia in 1908. Dr. Cumpston, how-
ever, explains the lack of information about
our last small-pox visitation. “It is not
unlikely that had access to the official records
in the various State Departments concerned
been possible, a greater amount of informa-
tion would have been obtained ; but the oppor-
tunity for access to official records was not
available, and, accordingly, the facts con-
tained in this history are largely confined to
those facts which have been made public.”
Well, why weren’t those State records avail-
able to the Commonwealth Director of
Quarantine? Is this continent a Common-
wealth or not? We need to know all the
latest facts about this disease; and all that
Dr. Cumpston can tell us, or is permitted to
tell us, dates back to 1908.
•
“V.”: Your examiner’s report upon Aus-
tralian literature of 1914 appears to present
certain openings to criticism on the biblio-
graphic side. If we may take the expres-
sion “were submitted for examination” as
equivalent to “were published,” the report is
faultsome in three ways:—
(1) Books published before 1914 receive
censure, e.g., The Beginnings of Government
and The Ballades.
(2) The number of books mentioned which
are of Australian origin, but printed abroad,
needs enlargement. Names like Wollaston,
Vaughan, Priestley, Newton, Green, Ren-
toul are conspicuous by absence.
(3) The list of Australian books is not
exhaustive. The works of the following
writers are fit to undergo the keen analysis
of your examiner: A. Siissjnilch (second ed.
of Introd. to the Geology of N.S.W.), G.
Chapman, Waterhouse and Lyell, Ernest
Henry Clark Oliphant, J. Smyth, E. Char-
lotte Onians, A. A. Holman.
[ (1) The annual report of Australian liter-
ature is compiled from the opiuions formed
of works reviewed upon the Red Page during
each year. Hitherto no attempt has been
made to confine the works reviewed strictly
to those actually published in each year.
To do so, in the case of overseas publica-
tions, which might not reach Australia till
February of the following year, would be to
delay the annual review too long. Roughly,
each year’s work is reviewed the following
year; and no injustice is suffered if the
basis of inclusion is that of the date of the
review in the Red Page. In the present in-
stance C. J. Brennan’s Poems are deliber-
ately held over for inclusion in the 1915
results. Both The Beginnings of Govern-
ment and The Ballades were thus held over
from the previous year.
(2) Only the more important books are
mentioned by name, but all the others that
were reviewed are considered. Names “con-
spicuous by absence” were either names not
regarded as worth notice or names of authors
whose books were not submitted for review
to this publication. If overseas publishers,
or Australian authors, do not desire the
criticism of this page by forwarding books
for review, they need not be hurt that that
criticism is not given. Nevertheless, efforts
are always made to get hold of such over-
seas publications for review.
(3) Publishers of Australian books who
do not submit their publications for review
stand in the same category. The names men-
tioned include some whose works were not
submitted for review, e.g. Waterhouse and
Lyell, and some whose work was considered,
and not. considered worthy of honorable
mention. Again, in this class, every effort
is made to obtain these works.—R.P.l

Make Your Channels, Dams, etc., with an Earth Scoop
The latest method of making Irrigation Channels, Drains, Dams, with little
or no labor, is by using an Earth Scoop which in every way surpasses the
pick and shovel.
A horse hitched to the runners is the only aid necessary for working these
Scoops. The mouth of the Scoop being specially sharpened, enters earth
readily. The body is pressed cold from a solid sheet of steel, which assures
its great strength. Each Scoop is fitted with Steel Runners and Detachable
Handles.

IF your bicycle is a B.S.A. every
day you ride you will appreciate
its easy running qualities.
At the end of twelve months you
will realize what B.S.A. reliability
means, because the repair account will
be practically nil.
When you think yon would like a
new machine you will be pleased your
old one was a 8.5. A., because you will
be able to sell it for a good price, while
if it had been a cheap “pattern” machine
it would simply sell as “scrap '.ron.
You get better service all round if
your bicycle is built of B.S.A. Fittings.

A CHARMING FIGURE
Within Every Woman’s Reach
The lack of a well-rounded, nicely-formed bust deprives a woman
of four-fifths of the charm that would otherwise be hers. . . .Are your
cheeks sunken and hollow? Have you deep lines around your mouth
and eyes? Are your arms thin and scrawny? And is your chest flat
and your bosom undeveloped? Do your shoulder-blades and the “salt-
cellars” that form at your throat make evening dress almost a tragedy?
Are you so thin that your clothes merely hang on you?
MRS. V. GRAHAM, of Stanley Street, Richmond, tells in the fol
lowing letter of her release from the thraldom of poor development
and deficient figure:—
“Your treatment is wonderful, and I have to thank
Dr. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD for not only restoring
my health, but for building up my figure and develop-
ing my bust to my entire satisfaction. I am better in
every way from its use, and it did exactly what you
s
%
Pi
claimed it would from its use, and even more quickly than you stated."
In many cases bust measurements have been increased by over ten inches, and the gain in
actual weight—equally distributed over the body in generally deficient cases —lias been over five
pounds weekly. Some other cases have shown an increase in weight of even a pound a day. The
average bust increase desired is about six inches, and is readily accomplished. Results guaranteed.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to attenuated women. We have hot space here, but
if you will write or call, we will give you hundreds of testimonials from grateful, happy women.
LET US SEND YOU A FREE TRIAL SAMPLE.
We want you to know just what FLESH-FOOD is, and will gladly give you a free sample.
Send a 2d. stamp, and let us forward a free trial sample and our instructive book on attenuation,
“LOVELY WOMAN.” FLESH-FOOD is put up in tablet form, and can be secretly takemif de-
sired. All correspondence is confidential and private, and all our literature is sent closely
covered and free from observation. Write at once. You are placed under no obligation what-
ever to buy because you send for sample. It is ABSOLUTELY FREE. CALL IF CONVENIENT.

the Tobacco Habit if
they knew they could
do so easily and also
without causing
themselves discom-
fort. ... It takes but
ten minutes for To-

To keep it up is to

TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-

from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

The Moon Dream.
The moon was all freckled with cloud,
The pipes of the fairies were shrill,
The tree pirouetted and bowed
To the wind sweeping over the hill—-
It was good to be chasing a cloud
With the moon peeping over the hill.
The lake of the sky was so blue,
And the stars were like fish in a net.
Now, what' was night trying to do,
Painting all the world amber and jet?
The sky was a cloud-tufted blue,
And the earth was all amber and jet.
O girl, with the wind in your hair!
There’s a dream running wild in my heart.
The night has a moonbeam to spare
To tie it and hold it apart—
Oh. tie up my dream in your hair,
Lest the nlad thing should try to depart!
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Shannon’s Dream.
Now, this is the dream of Shannon
Told, sometimes, to beguile
The night hours. As we listen
We do not laugh the while.
For. grouped around the red logs,
Within their crimson gleam,
Each nods to each and mutters,
“Can this be all a dream?”
Says Shannon, smoking hugely,
His smoke rings wreathed above,
“There comes a time when all men
Must fend the thing they love.”
“I won her—held her lightly—
Yet, by my natal star,
I swear her eyes, her tresses,
Might stir a world to war!
“You, lad, and you, have seen her;
You know her fair and kind —
Think, then, how blind was Shannon
To think the whole world blind.
“Yet others saw and warned me—
Said one: ‘The woman’s fair;
Fair women win fine courtship.’
Another said : ‘Beware !’
“I laughed, smoked, gamed and sported,
And sang with glass agleam —
Till, somehow—how I know not —
I think I dreamt a dream.
“I stood in Champion’s stockyard
Upon a noon of day;
I stood in Champion’s stockyard,
And she was far away.
“I stood in Champion’s stockyard
(You know old Champion well),
The sun was hot, ’twas Summer,
And there the dream befell.
“The sun grew bleached and wizened,
The plains, vague spaces lay;
I saw her face in shadow,
And she was far away.
“The ice-cold grip of terror
Was tense aoooc my neart;
I felt the chill of peril
And we were wide apart!
“I rode from Champion’s stockyard—
No longer fatuous, blind —
Bent forward in my saddle,
My rifle slung behind.
“With wide eyes, set and staring,
Across the endless plains,
I rode through blazing Summer,
With Winter in my veins.
“I saw her face in shadow,
And down to lull 1 same.
I saw her face in shadow,
And red my rowels drank.
“Yet, ever as I galloped—
Mane clutched, and forward bent—
I pondered on the Shadow,
And what the Shadow meant.
“As one who rides death-harried,
My hurry never ceased;
The ' sun crept ever westward,
And I sped ever east.
“I swore to fight the Shadow,
To front it unafraid,
If speed of hoof could save her,
And strength of arm could aid.
“I threw one look' behind me.
The plains lay still and brown,
And red with sullen menace
The staring sun went down.
“Then fell a chill foreboding
Beneath the pallid skies —
The sun had sunk forever,
And never more would rise.
“The world had run its cycle,
Its day of loving light;
It, too, beneath the Shadow
Was doomed to Ever-Night!
“Then darkness—thick, appalling—
Rushed down upon the plain,
Yet ever on and onward
I rode with reefing rein.
“And then, this thing befell me;
Upon that awful night,
I saw myself a legion . , .
That stretched to left and right!
“I saw myself made many,
My features multiplied.
Ah God! ’Twas weird, uncanny,
That spectral, midnight ride.
“Ten thousand urgent riders,
They rode abreast with me,
In silence grim and earnest,
Knee nigh to touching knee.
“To free her from the Shadow —
Keen-eyed, no longer blind—
We sped, our heads thrust forward,
Our rifles slung behind.
“And then” —he pauses, musing;
We listen, open eyed—
“l woke in Champion’s stockyard,
And she was at my side.
“And that’s the dream,” says Shannon,
And stoops to get a light
Then straightens up, and rises
And peers into the night.

THE SHORTEST WAY TO
TIPPERARY.
The longer the war lasts the clearer it
becomes that it is no cakewalk for the Allies.
Germany has not merely to be beaten on
points ; it must be knocked out and rendered
incapable of discommoding the world for
generations. How is it to be done, and
when? The Kaiser’s women-and-children-
butchers still occupy the richest part of
France. They so pervade Belgium that their
swollen-headed monarch has proclaimed it
a German province. They hold a part of
Boland and hold it hard. The Russian bear
plods gallantly on, but his plodding is ham-
pered by the railway system of the Father-
land. Positions which he arrives at after
weeks of battling through the most horrible
roads on earth are reached in as many hours
by the enemy, who meet them fresh and
well-fed, and so dash into action. The
Russian may weigh his carefully-prepared
foe down by sheer weight of numbers in
course of time, but it may be a very long
time. Before the Gerhog’s western frontier
is reached he will need to be belted out of
France and pushed off the face of Belgium.
Every traversable yard of these regions is
mined, trenched, fortified and in every other
respect known to human and diabolical in-
genuity rendered as nearly impassable as
possible. The atmosphere will have grown
tired of the sensation of having Zouaves
and Sikhs, and pion-pions, and British
Tommies blown through it long before an
Allied soldier enjoys his first wash in the
Rhine.
* * * *
And when the Rhine is reached and
forded, and its mighty fortifications reduced,
and the bloody march to Berlin accom-
plished ; when the Kaiser bolts distractedly
out of one end of the city as the cavalry of
Britain, or Australia, or Italy, or Rou-
mania, as the case may be, hurries in the
other end —what then? Germany will have
been beaten on points. But under Arma-
geddon rules only a knock-out counts. If
ever a nation was utterly flattened out
Belgium —with its army living precariously
in holes on the edge of its territory; with
its heroic king in a state of perpetual
motion; and with its Government trans-
ferred to a foreign country—is that nation.
And if it has any rival for the Affliction
Stakes Servia- —with its capital blown to
pieces its army more than decimated and
its non-combatants starving—is obviously
the one. Yet both are resisting as strongly
as ever What Germany hasn t been able
to do to a stone-broke, war-ravaged country
like Servia, and to an unprepared nation
like Belgium, the Allies are going to find
it hideously difficult to achieve in regard
to Germany.
* * * *
And what is this part of the Empire
doing in the matter? In the early stages
of the war some of its rich men and big
institutions subscribed mildly—very mildly
in many cases —to the Patriotic Funds.
There was a good deal of defiant singing,
also a flood of oratory concerning the Em-
pire and Australia’s obligations to the Flag.
Meanwhile the First Expeditionaries were
allowed to go away with horse-drawn ambu-
lances because there was no cash available
to buy motor-driven ones. The very rich
showed the readiest willingness to en-
courage their women-folk to knit socks arid
Balaclava helmets, but the canniest reluc-
tance to hand out subscriptions big enough
to inconvenience themselves in . the smallest
degree. Having written their trifling cheques
and stated their loyal sentiments in song, they
turned upon the local youth and accused
him of cowardice, and dereliction from duty
in not having come forward more eagerly
to join the colors. In point of fact the local
youth is all right. Thousands of him have
offered and thousands more are still offering
all that they have to give, and without a,ny
great persuasion either. With a few glaring
exceptions the best sort of young men are
doing all they can to hasten the end of the
war. The rotten patriotism is being evinced
by their seniors.
* * * *
Anyone can see it who troubles to look
below the surface of blither with which our
bogus patriots always cloud the real issues.
Take the question of the Tariff. The whole
of the importing classes are fighting strenu-
ously, in, the name of Empire, against any
change in the direction of higher duties.
They want the Commonwealth to persist
in the pernicious old business, of indenting
cheap foreign goods and paying for them
with borrowed money and raw products.
The importer who is allowed to go on in-
definitely dragging goods built by . nigger
or other sweated labor over a low tariff wall
and selling them at white men’s prices, is
obviously in a sound position to give freely
to Patriotic Funds. But he is not doing any-
thing for patriotism. The Germans have a
saying that war may be made into a busi-
ness. They are making a business of it
now. Never, it is declared, was there less
unemployment in Germany. All available
hands are hard at work producing some-
thing or other. It is the same in the
Allied countries which are in a position. to
continue manufacture. The articles which
are being specialised in are, of course, guns,
clothing for the troops, foodstuffs, medical
appliances, machinery and the innumerable
requirements of armies in the field. One
of the aims of the German generals on their
eastern frontier is understood to be to ex-
haust Russia’s supply of arms and ammu-
nition. Britain and France have the duty
of seeing that this .does not happen. Servia
and Belgium are, in the nature of things,
hard up. London and Paris will have to
find cash and munitions and food for them.
Turn from that to consider the position, of
the Commonwealth in this crisis. Owing
to a fiscal policy arranged largely with an
eye to the importing interests, Australia is
making nothing worth mentioning that is of
use in warfare. It is giving no help of this
sort to Britain. It is true that Australia
has clothing factories —and true, likewise,
that only a few days ago, a number of them
refused to tender to supply the troops with
uniforms because of the insertion of a
“walking delegate” clause in the Govern-
ment contracts. Australia also makes boots
on a small scale, and assembles .the parts
of warships, and does a little in the way
of saddle and harness-making. But what
it should be doing, and what it would be
doing if it had not listened to. the voice of
the importer, includes the building of its
own big guns, its own warships and mer-
chant vessels, its own motoi’-cars, lorries
and ambulances, and every detail of. army
equipment; and by so much removing a
burden from the heavily-taxed shoulders of
Britain.
* * * *
There are two schools of thought in the
Commonwealth at the present time. One of
them is accused, by the same people who
used to talk of the Australian navy project
as a “madman’s dream.” of an outlook which
is wild, experimental, unpractical and vision-
ary. This school says that the war is likely
to las-t for years; that, in the circumstances,
it is poor patriotism to continue draining
Britain of munitions and money; and that
the better way t is to start to make a business
of war by constructing field guns, ships and
all the other service necessaries which it has
been accustomed to import. The other school
gives three cheers for the Empire, addresses
a recruiting meeting, sings the National
Anthem, says Germany will be beaten to its
knees and eating out of the hand by August,
and asks that everything shall continue as
before. These people don’t want to see
factories arise if the price of them is a tariff
which will interfere with the indent trade,
and they don’t want London borrowing to
stop, since that may result in a slump in their
line of business. They want victory without
financial tears, the swift ending of the war
by the complete effacement of the greatest
military power in the world and no damage
done to their shops and warehouses. It is
not to be managed. The shortest route to
Tipperary, so far as we have the building of
it, is a causeway strewn with heroic sacri-
fices not only of men, but of other things.
The Commonwealth has poled on the har-
assed old Motherland for too long. If its
rich men want to do service as valuable as
that which the Expeditionaries are offering,
they will get to work, and by every possible
means organise and build up all the local
industries that -the country can hold. And
thev won’t waste a needless minute over it
either.
THE PROBLEM OF NICHOLAS
MUTTON AND OTHERS.
Nicholas Mutton, aided by, or connected
with. Drew and Maloney, and indirectly
mixed up with, or abetted, or alleged to have
been in the company of, or found sleeping in
the same paddock as the N.S.W. Government,
has made a little bit of history or mystery.
Probably the thing is mystery. It is mixed
mystery, and hard to decipher, but it is
interesting so far as it goes.
Some time back the Ministry of All the
Talents rushed into the breach, or what it
thought was the same thing, but probably
wasn’t; and annexed, or professed to annex,
all the wheat in the State at a fixed price
of ss. per bushel. There being abundance
of wheat in the State for local requirements
this seemed rather like the hurried action
of a crowd which must keep itself before the
public eye or burst. It recalls the position
of a certain “buck” in the days of George
IV. who owed his social importance solely
to the fact that he could get round a large
and fashionable drawing-room by jumping
from one chair to another, and without once
touching the floor, though he occasionally
leaped on the mantel-piece. He wasn’t use-
ful, but he was unusual. The wheat thus
annexed was mostly re-sold to. Private
Enterprise in the shape of the miller, and
as he was under no restrictions in the
matter of price the poor old loaf showed
no visible diminution in the figure charged.
A considerable row was made over the fact
that three very rich Private Enterprise
city firms got the sole right to buy wheat
for the Government. It was alleged (1)
that the commission paid to them was ab-
surd and enormous, and unprecedented;
(2) that having a monopoly of the business
they felt no need to be even reasonably
punctual; (3) that their appointment
wiped out the business of a lot of equally
deserving country firms; (4) that the whole
affair was unpleasant. Then there was . a
row because existing contracts with Vic-
toria (which represented border trade) were
cancelled, while the State Government
gladly entered into new arrangements, for
which there were no contracts, to supply
Tasmania and Maoriland (this, of course,
represented Sydney trade). Certain people
were wild: (1) The individual who had
undertaken to buy wheat at a certain price
and to deliver flour at a certain price, and
who found his supply of wheat cut off while
his liability to hand over the flour remained ;
(2) the man who had contracted to sell
wheat in Victoria and found his N.S.W.
supply cut off while Ms Victorian liability
remained; (3) the farmer who hadn’t sold
his wheat and who had to take ss. per
bushel, payable whenever the agent had
time to come round, whereas he had en-
joyed golden visions of Gs. Gd. And one
man was glad—the speculator who had con-
tracted, in the early pa'rt of the season,
when the prospects looked good, to deliver
wheat at 4s. or 4s. Gd., and who had the
pleasure of seeing his disastrous bargain
declared null and void.
* * * *
Somewhere here come in Maloney and
Drew and Nicholas Mutton. The story
propounded is that they were on the wrong
side of the market, or represented people
who were on the wrong side of the market.
The anecdote goes that it would have been
worth 2d. or a heap of money to them or
the people they stood for, if the Govern-
ment , cancelled all existing contracts for
the sale of wheat in N.S.W., otherwise they
would have to buy at a high war-and-
drought price and sell at a low figure. The
narrative runs or straggles that money was
put up handsomely by certain people, in-
cluding Nicholas Mutton, or folks repre-
sented by him, and was handed to Drew,
and Drew was supposed to peg in vigor-
ously, and to render no accounts. Also that
the existing contracts were cancelled. Also
that Nicholas Mutton was quite satisfied.
Also that Maloney didn’t say that any-
thing was wrong. Also that Drew
didn’t become wild and fly off the
handle. Still, there has arisen a
question as to what, exactly, Drew did to
earn the money and applause of Maloney
and Nicholas Mutton, assuming that they
applauded as much as alleged, _ and that
they were as deeply imbedded in an im-
poverished speculation as alleged. A vague
report is ' circulated that somebody who
might be neither Mutton nor Maloney,
thought Drew —if there is any such person
as Drew —could bring influence to bear on
Somebody. But the one individual whom
Nobody can find at short notice is Some-
body.
POTSDAM’S CALL ON THE SPHINX.
The German commander who is invading
Egypt and giving the Australian expedi-
tionaries some pleasurable expectations, has
before him one of the big jobs of history.
The British armies there stand behind 130
miles of desert, parts of which have been
flooded by the sea. They are also shielded
by the Suez Canal, which is broad and deep,
and can be used for concentrating the
heaviest artillery on any required point at
a speed of 10 miles an hour. Lighter guns
or smaller ships can be concentrated -at no
less than 15 miles an hour. / ' r The British
have an unlimited supply of- fresh water
from the Fresh Water Canal, arid a railway
system, running the entire length of the
canal, which can be used for' concentrating
any but the heaviest artillery at 50 miles
an hour. Deb Goltz, operating from the
desert side, has to first beat down the defend-
ing forces, bridge the canal, and seize the
Fresh Water Canal. Such part of the raiW
way as he would in these
acquire would be of no use to him beeausb--
he would have no railhead. He could-
not * approach either Port Said or Suez
because of the warships. Neither would
be of use to him in any event. He cannot
blow up the canal, because by so doing he
would destroy his own mobility. If he
leaves it intact war vessels may cut his
lines.
* * * *
The army which he leads is called Turkish,
but SO per cent, of it is Arab. Such as it is,
it is now mostly in the neighborhood _ of
Lake Tiberias, which is roughly 300 miles
from the canal. As the troops advance a
light railway has to be built to supply them
with water. If that line is cut by the
British, the invaders are lost. The protect-
ing artillery is limited to mountain batteries,
which are camel-borne. These guns should
have been supplemented by ' better ones
brought to Haifa on a fugitive German
steamer, but the latter was taken by the
British destroyer Racoon just outside the
port. In matters of this sort the British
fleet is most inconsiderate.
* * * *
The loyalty of the army is confused. The
Turks reciprocate the hatred of the Arab
elements. To conciliate the Syrians dek
Goltz re-appointed a number of Arab offi-
cers who had been cashiered by the Turks.
He also appointed an Arab as commander
in Syria—an unheard-of proceeding which
has bitterly antagonised the Turks. Then
he destroyed the conciliatory effect of his
earlier action by compelling every Arab in-
habitant to supply the army with, a sack
and a tin can. The can and sack constitute
the total transport. A bridge for the canal
has been built in sections, and was last
heard of definitely at Lake Tiberias. To
reach the canal it will have to be hauled
through deserts of sand, under a cascade of
shells, by an army balancing a can of water
on its head. Meanwhile a certain amount
of disaffection admittedly prevails because
the German language has been made com-
pulsory in the Syrian schools, and many of
the coastal inhabitants are begging the
allies to come and occupy the coastline,
where the Yalis have renounced allegiance
to the Porte. On top of all this there is
news of Britain’s acceptance of Roumania’s
Treasury Bills, which suggests that Rou-
mania. is about to enter the war. If so the
road between Germany and Turkey will be
closed. This will cut off Von pER Goltz
and leave him alone in the dark with Turkey.
And Turkey isn’t a pleasant person to be
left in the dark with.
* * * *
In short, Von der Goltz seems up against
it. The cable mentioned last week that he
had been shot. That seems to be untrue.
The fact probably is that he merely wishes
he had been.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Fetich of Property.
A contributor recently told The Rulletin
that the High Court decision in Eather’s
case is “one of the most momentous since
the creation of that tribunal,” and he was
right. For the Court therein definitely
refused to take part in the administration of
the criminal law of the
attitude represented one more effort to “play
the sedulous ape” to the Privy 'Council —a
body with which it has nothing ijU common.
The Privy Council defined its attitude
towards criminal appeals in Arnold’s case.
It said in effect that, because the systems of
criminal administration obtaining among the
hundreds of millions of people of all races
and colors whose affairs it governed were so
infinitely various, it would refuse to inter-
fere with local tribunals unless an obvious
miscarriage of justice had occurred.
Arnold’s case —one in which the prosecutor
had also acted as judge, at a trial in one of
Britain’s Asiatic possessions—was indicated
as the type of such a case. The High Court
now applies this principle to Australia,
though Australia’s various criminal systems,
subject to trifling technical variations, are
identical. In Eather’S case a point of law
was involved which was as pre-eminently
fitted for the consideration of the High
Court as any that has yet come before it,
inasmuch as it was difficult, novel and
important. The High Court has delivered
profound and considered judgments in a
dispute about the question of property in a
two-headed baby, and 'it has likewise gone
exhaustively into the rights of the owner
of a slot machine in relation to the observ-
ance of the Sabbath. But these were civil
cases. Eather’s was only a criminal case.
And as the Chief Justice frequently
observed: “If we are to entertain appeals
in this sort of way, we will become a Court
of Appeal from every criminal court in the
Commonwealth.” Mere taxpayers, who find
these Judges their salary, will, of course,
answer “Why not?” They forget. the
instinctive disdain of the high-claSs lawyer
for criminal work. They overlook the fact
that his mind is congenitally bent towards
commercial cases, and that the coarse and
muddy boots of the burglar and the. burglar’s
unsightly attorney are hateful to him. Now,
this is the lawyer’s own affair while he is
still in private practice. Once he goes on
to the Bench, though, he loses this right to
disdain. The community is as much entitled
then to exact his construction of its criminal
statutes as it is of its civil ones. Above
all in Australia is it necessary that a really
sound tribunal should be cheaply and readily
available for every purpose. The com-
mixture of good, bad, indifferent
and even rotten law which steadily flows
from the Supreme Court Benches of the
various States needs constant and careful
supervision by thoroughly capable men. In
this very case of Eather’s, Justice Isaacs,
Who dissented, said there had been a misin-
terpretation of the law by the lower Courts
so grave as to lift the case far beyond the
regions of mere legal error. The High Court
excuses itself from dealing with so
unpleasant a matter by pointing out that
ic has power to make “exceptions” and
“regulations” for its own governance.. But
such a question as that of imposing limita-
tions on the right of Criminal Appeal is not
to be decided so cavalierly,*, One way of
settling the matter acceptably is for the
Attorney-General to see to it that the terms
of the "Court’s limitation, if any, are fixed
with precision by the Federal Parliament.
Another apd perhaps better way is for the
High Court to give up being so. naughty,
and to attend to one of the jobs it is paid
to attend to.
A Rational Fighting Policy.
Dear Bulletin, —Mr. Ernst LissAuer has
written sa “Hymn of Hate” expressive or
German feelings towards the British
Empire. It is being taught in the schools
of the intensely teachable Fatherland ; it is
chanted and declaimed at places of entei-
tainment; the insane Butcher has even con-
ferred the Order of the Red Eagle upon the
author. And still the Englanders whom the
impressionable Germans are told to hate
evermore are treating the great na 10 <
movement as a joke, even as they treated
German aspirations for world c 2 nc * „
before the war began. When a German
warship is sunk in a naval engagemen


Englanders assist the struggling crew to
escape drowning, whilst German aviators
drop bombs on the damp strugglers in the
hope that they are English. Also German
gunners fire upon the men in the water, not
caring how many of their own countrymen
they kill if they can perchance pot a rescue
party. Good ! This is war of the German
brand —War of Hate. A rescued German
naval officer is welcomed as a prisoner
aboard a British ship—and he spits in the
welcomer’s face. Good! He is entitled to
his Hate. But what are the British doing
towards equalising matters in a non-bar-
baric way? Nothing! Here in Australia
we are taught that it is wrong to suspect
resident Germans of the hate which the
Fatherland Government is teaching in its
schools. Unfair to suspect them of
treacherous tendencies towards the country
which was included in the German scheme
of \Vorld conquest; wrong to hold them
responsible for their gory national ideals, as
though national ideals were mere Govern-
ment creations and German socialism were
a juicy cocoanut full of the milk of human
kindness. Here in Melbourne we have
truculent Germans who, being nominally
“interned,” are released on parole when they
profess love for Australia, and are left to
earn salaries in public institutions. Even
the gas co. employee who calls at my house
every month is a German who cannot con-
ceal his nationality. I don’t return him
hate for hate, but when an inoffensive Aus-
tralian comes on the other’s heels with a
tale of unemployment—well, I wish he had
the German fellow’s billet. A reasonable
answer to Mr. Lissauer’s “Hymn of Hate.”
so dear to the. Kaiser and his people, would
be the expulsion of all unquestionable and
questionable Germans from British coun-
tries where they have prospered in the belief
that they were the advance guards of a
coming German conquest. They shouldn’t
have the tendons of their trigger finger cut,
or be bombed, or spat at, or otherwise in-
sulted. They should be given a cold, formal
acknowledgment of the justice of their
national ideals, and then be shipped off to
Germany to fight for their Hate, if they
want to. This is a life and death struggle
between German and British national ideals,
and every able-bodied man deserves a fair
chance to fight for his Cause. The Germans
living in enemy countries, like the British
similarly situated, are denied a fair chance.
They all —German and British —should be
exported to their respective Fatherland or
Motherland, free of charge. It will come to
this, probably before the war is a year older.
Why delay it? —Yours, E. F.
The Triumphs of Mr. Smith.
Bruce Smith has written another 10-ton
treatise to prove that the whole Labor policy
is wrong: in particular, that Public Enter-
prise and the White Australia doctrine are
the Devil, or possibly two devils. The
tremendous Mr. Smith is, however, always
too vague. Instead of thundering at large
against Public or Collective Enterprise, why
not be practical and show the unfailing mag-
nificent results of the only other sort of
Enterprise there is? For instance, the fruit
and vegetable business of Bruce Smith’s
own Sydney—what more perfect illustration
could there be than that? Within 30 miles
of Sydney hundreds of tons of peaches lie
rotting under the trees. Scores of orchards,
having ruined the orchardist, have been
abandoned. Those who continue at the
business make a beggarly'living at it. Yet
in Sydney Bruce Smith can’t get a dozen
decent peaches in a bag for less than a shil-
ling; and other fruit is even dearer, unless
Bruce takes his chance at a surreptitious
barrow. Hundreds of tons of it rotting
within 30 miles of Sydney, and in Sydney
itself the stuff regarded not as a food but as
a luxury ! So much for the superior quali-
ties of Private Enterprise. Admittedly, Pub-
lic or Collective Enterprise may often make
a mess of things. But, all the same, it is
the only sort of enterprise that even Bruce
Smith, consistent individualist though he
thinks himself, is prepared to trust in times
of crisis. How, for instance, would he
feel about it if, Bill of Berlin having
broken loose, word went out in England that
Belgium and France wanted help, and excur-
sion boats would carry across anybody who
had a gun and cared to use it —fare, 17s. 6d. ?
How would Bruce Smith feel about it if
Private Enterprise had had the job of protect-
ing the Australian capitals and Australian
shipping from the marauding German cruisers
that were recently in these waters? As for
the sinfulness of the White Australia policy,
let the Northern Territory be Bruce
Smith’s answer. It is the one part of the
continent where the white settler has been
able to command almost whatever tint in
labor he pleased. It is the one great area
to whose mines cheap Chinese have
been freely admitted. And it is the one
part of Australia where mining is most
thoroughly dead. In other States, if there
have been movements away from certain
country districts, there at least has been a'
growth of population in the aggregate. Only
the Northern Territory, blessed with Bruce
Smith’s discolored brother, has steadily and
persistently slipped back. On the other
hand, in the Queensland sugar districts
the disappearance of Tommy Tanna, the
Kanaka, has been followed by a greater pros-
perity than ever the industry before experi-
enced. In fact, it was more the prosperity
of that industry than anything else which
enabled the Government the other day, when
the Imperial loan was being cut up, to say
that it could do without any of it, thank
you. How is it that Bruce Smith can’t
say the same thing about the Northern Terri-
tory, which has had all the blessings that
he thunders about so tremendously?

Under the Fat Thumb of Cohen.
The event which was long. foretold looks
like a. real happening at last. Australia
has a monstrous debt, and the great bulk of
its loans fall due on fixed dates. Only one
State (Westralia) makes even a plausible
pretence of providing a sinking fund for
repayment, and its pretence is poor and
inadequate. In a general way the great
Australian IOU really reads as follows: —
The State ofi Blank acknowledges the receipt of
£10,000,000 from Abraham Bull-Cohen. This
amount is repayable on January 1 in the year Blank.
Repayment depends entirely on the State’s luck in
borrowing £10;000,000 from Abraham Bull-Cohen
to repay him with. If the aforesaid creditor really
wants his money he can’t have it, but if he doesn’t
want it he can get it.
The first loan of size—at least it tVas only
£2,000,000—which fell due after -the war
strain began to be badly felt in Europe has
just been renewed for five years at a figure
which, including expenses and discount,
works out at 5 per cent, per annum. The
old interest rate was 4 per cent. Thus the
burden of the original £2,000,000 loan
becomes equal to £2,500,000, which is, a big
jump to make in a single day. And when
Queensland comes along next July, by which
time things will probably be a great deal
worse, aqd' announces that it must have
£11,700,000 at any cost or else burst, the
response may easily be : “Pay 71 per cent,
or else burst.” There are exciting possi-
bilities ahead. In fact, the real joy may be
only commencing.
The Things that Don’t Happen.
“Petronius Earbiteb” : The amazing
energy of the average Australian policeman
is dazzlingly illustrated through the long,
droughty, loanly, war-scarred year by the
almost daily triumphs that are not recorded
about him in the great papers. For instance,
we don’t read things like this:
ANOTHER GAMBLING RAID.
' HEBREW PASTIME DISTURBED.
At the Police Court yesterday morning, before
Messrs. Sozzletap and Bdmblefoot, J’s.P., 24
wealthy bookmakers, pawnbrokers, bankers, agents
and squatters were each fined £lO and costs, with
the alternative of three months’ imprisonment, for
having been found in a house occupied (nominally)
by Theodore Gilt edge, and used as a common
gaming-house. Inspector Bullant stated that gam-
bling was greatly on the increase in Sydney, especi-
ally at some of the night-and-day clubs. At 10 p.m.
on Saturday, from information received, he (wit-
ness), with Sub-Inspector ButtersnatchEß, Sergeants
Blue, Green and Black, Senior-Constables Hard-
Case, Swizzle, Jamtin and Freebeer, and 13 plain-
clothes men, raided the premises in question. One
of the accused, Giltedge, tried to prevent the police
from entering, but he was promptly trodden on, and
a rush made for the smoking-room of the house,
which was known as the Pure Merino Club. The
defendants were found seated at various little tables,
playing poker, bridge and ordinary whist; and money
and card-scorers and whisky and soda were found all
over the place. He (witness) had ascertained from
various statements made by some of the accused that
these deplorable and moral-wrecking games were
being played for sovereigns—in the case of the
poker-play he believed that the stakes were very
much higher. As the Bench well knew, the wives
and families of these men often went short of a
motor-car and a grand piano in consequence of this
gaming, and the police were determined to put it
down. (Applause in court, which was immediately
suppressed.) The amount of money lying about the
tables and seized by the police totalled £478 10s.,
while on searching the accused at the police station
the sum of £3492 11s. sd. was found upon them —
mostlv in notes. Every one of the accused also
carried a cheque-book, which, from, the police point
of view, was an extraordinary thing, but he had been
informed by accused Giltedge, who called himself
the secretary of the club, that it was the usual
thing. Giltedge had added voluntarily that nobody
could become a member of the Pure Merino Club
unless he carried one. He (Inspector Bullant)
would ask the Bench to inflict a heavy penalty as a
warning to others. Mr. Mutton, K.C., and Mr.
Wooltop, who appeared for the accused, urged the
Bench to dismiss the , case, at it would create a
very bad impression. So long as the police confined
their unwelcome attention to the Chinese and their
horrible fantan habits —a game at which many poor
men lost as much as 7fd. at a sitting—nobody would
complain. But if this sort of thing was to be
allowed where would people be? Where would it
end ? The accused made no secret of their pastime,
and the club door was open to the whole street,
though, of course, porters, stewards and messengers
were there to prevent any unseemliness. The games
were simply pastimes, and were carried on strictly
among, and by, the members themselves. No police-
constable had ever been permitted to lose or win a
penny in the club. Inspector Bullant insisted on a
conviction, and the Bench therefore decided to con-
vict.
Theodore Giltedge. was then charged with having
kept a common gaming-house, but the charge was
withdrawn on payment of costs, as the accused was
among the 24 persons who had been found on the
premises. As they were leaving the court some of
the defendants were loud in their protests at being
“treated as if they were dirt, or .Chinese.” One pro-
minent member of the club remarked several times
that the country was going to the D —, a statement
that received general assent. The Bench compli-
mented Inspector Bullant and his officers and men
on their action, and added that their bravery in
bearding such desperate criminals in their den of
vice would be brought to the notice of the proper
authorities. After a suitable acknowledgment from
Inspector Bullant, who said that the police would
always do their duty, the proceedings—which had
created some stir—ended.

A Victorian Railway Freak.
“0.K.” on “the maddest thing in Victorian
Railways”:—
The Peacock Government, whilst spending a lot of
money on railways, carefully ignores the scandal of
the old Fern Tree Gully line, and the more recent
and ridiculous narrow gauge to Gembrook. Travel-
ling to the Gully and the fertile district beyond it is
a maddening experience five days of the week, and
even on excursion days. The one train that leaves
Melbourne at 8.50 gets to the Gully (19 miles) at
10.30 or later. At the Gully, which is a popular
summer resort, passengers for places as far as Gem-
brook transfer themselves to toy carriages built for
the narrow winding line which was cut along the
hillsides some 15 years ago. It could have gone
straight to Gembrook, instead of winding like a
wounded worm ; but this would have cost an extra-
twopence 15 years ago, so the ridiculous toy train
continues on the serpentine route to this day. All
the way from Fern Tree Gully to Upwey anew high-
way is being hewn out of the hill-slopes. This road
runs a good few yards inside the boundary fence of
the man who owns all the hills thereabouts. His un-
improved propputy (there may be more than one
hill-owner, but the fattest one will stand for the lot
in this sermon) extends nearly to the railway line,
and for years and years he has been holding these
expanses of eligible residential sites in one of the
loveliest and most fertile parts within 25 miles of
Melbourne —-holding them for a steady rise in value.
After the railway was made the hillsides still needed
a good, wide road to make them very valuable; so
the local shire authorities, or whoever runs the busi-
ness of road-making, arrived and compensated the
land-owner handsomely for invading his propputy in
order to make it valuable. This is a digression from
the scandal of the Melbourne to Fern Tree Gully rail-
way service, but it is not out of the picture. Did
I say how long the Gembrook liners take to return
to town at night? Well, they wind their weary way
to the Gully with long stoppages at the roadside, and
when they get there they find a train for town await-
ing them. There never was and more patient train.
It goes on waiting for another 30 to 40 minutes.
From Upwey to Melbourne is 23 miles, and you can
never do it in less than 130 minutes. And the fare
is subject to variation. A frequent week-end visitor
who had been paying the wild, uncertain fare at a
railway pigeon-hole went to the Tourist Bureau to
see if he could come to a definite understanding with
the Department, and then he learned that, so far as
the Tourist Bureau is concerned, the Gembr.ook line
does not exist. He could buy a tourist tioket for any
station on any and every country line in Victoria
except the one that most tourists want to take 1
Five Thousand a Year.

“Aristide” wants to start a revolution:—
If we must have State Governors (and the Labor
party seems as bound to the system as the Liberals),
why not get the best available goods for our money,
instead of social nonentities, party hacks or indivi-
duals who have a pull in Downing-street ?
We must start on the assumption that the official
has to be imported. For our £SOOO we could get
some of the very best men at the London Bar. The
popular impression' about their' enormous incomes is
wrong. Hilaire Belloc speaks of “that brilliant
young barrister commonly said to be making over
£II,OOO a year, and who actually is making
£3000.” Belloc knew what he was talking about.
At the English Common Law Bar there are only about
10 Silks who are making solid, reliable incomes. These
are men such as Carson, Finlat, Simon and a half-
dozen others. Precarious as is the position of all
barristers, that of the Silk is the most precarious.
Many brilliant and thriving juniors, drawn by the
lure of the front bench, take Silk in the hope of
ousting one of the small band which holds the work.
The project fails, and the tragedy of the briefless
junior is intensified in the tragedy of the briefless
Silk. Yet these are men of brilliant capacity. We
could get them.
Or, if we liked it better, a man of letters 1 What
an episode in the picturesque had George Meredith
ended his days amongst us as a Governor 1 And he
might have done so had we ever had the sense or
the imagination to will it. Suppose that to-day one
of the six States had Chesterton, or Belloc, or
Max Beerboiim. The presence of one of these men
would fix the eyes of the world upon us, and that
is what we want. At present we pay a great wage
to an obscurity. Grant that we get our foundation-
stones laid with unerring accuracy. Assume that it
would be utterly beyond the -capacity of Max Beer-
boiim to open a blind asylum. He could depute one
of his A.D.C.’s, a secretary, or even the butler, and
any one of them would do it as well as it is done
at present. Probably, indeed, the butler would do
it with a profounder touch of the grand manner
than anyone.
In the matter of artists the range would be very
wide. The £SOOO would be simply rushed by almost
any living painter. Probably the unmarried and
superfluously wealthy Sargent is the only one in the
world who would refuse it. If such a man were
wisely chosen we should indeed have one who might
be of use to us, and who would help to replace the
horrors which infest our picture galleries with worthy
things.
The Australian States want to be advertised' over-
seas. The present quality of State Governor doesn’t
advertise either Australia or the States. He is about
as conspicuous as a wombat. The men suggested,
even if they proved useless socially, would be as
conspicuous as lighthouses.

At an “informal private conference” with
Labor representatives in Wellington (M.L.),
Andrew Fisher said that “the democratic
platform must come from the people—not
from any political leader. The people must
pot leave their programmes to be settled by
the leaders, however clever. The people’s
proper political basis of action must be a
platform agreed to by a duly accredited and
representative conference of all Labor or-
ganisations.” Just such a “representative
conference” in Australia agreed upon “the
restriction of public borrowing” and the
provision of sinking funds for the purpose
of paying off the loans. Yet Andrew
Fisher poured contempt upon the Labor
platform, so far as it has reference to public
borrowing and sinking funds, and declared
that “sinking funds for permanent and re-
productive loans are a great absurdity in a
new country.” Furthermore, he had
“always considered” such funds to be
“greatly absurd.” What is the good of
calling conferences for the formation of
platforms, and what is the good of Andrew
Fisher advising his hearers to have no-
thing to do with programmes put forward
by leaders, when he himself has no hesita-
tion in pouring scorn upon the very pro-
posals and demands that have been made by
such conferences, and which he has been
put in power to abide by loyally? It is
time Andrew Fisher “cleared his mind of
cant,” and ceased using conventional Labor-
istic phrases. The cant of the professional
Laborist is becoming even more nauseously
insincere than that of the conventional
wowser. Indeed, the cant phrases of the
wowser are not always insincere; some-
times they are uttered with the most com-
plete and fiery earnestness. This does not
seem to be the case with a Fisher when he
utters the shibboleths of Laborism; for he
tells us—now that by uttering them he has
reached a position of power and affluence —
that he has always disbelieved in some of
them, and those, as it happens, the soundest
and most admirable.

The garbage question of Sydney is said to be
growing more intricate, though why it
should be intricate the Lord only knows.
The trains come down to Sydney carrying
multitudinous tons of wheat, hay, straw,
wool, sheep, bullocks and sundries. They go
back carrying a few cases of imported
drapery, some tinned goods, a boxer hat,
sundry boots, and a letter saying that the
interest on the mortgage is overdue. Obvi-
ously these return trains ought to carry
garbage. With it they could fertilise and
elevate the plains, and by elevating the
plains they could improve the rainfall. Then
the interior would flourish like the shade-
less gum-tree, and grow more hay, and send
it to Sydney, and get back more garbage
as a consequence, and so the thing would go
round in a beneficial circle. The present
idea is to flatten out and impoverish the
country, in order to make refuse with which
to fill up the sea, so that agriculture is
ruined on one side and navigation is
damaged on the other. And in between the
two the pretty girl who goes surf-bathing
finds dead cats and ruins bumping up
against her legs—very shapely legs as a rule.

Months ago, when it was known that Aus-
tralian wheat would be short, and that Vic-
toria would be the chief sufferer, there was
still a chance of getting the grain at a mod-
erate price. But the Peacock Govern-
ment dallied, and the trade either couldn’t
or wouldn’t bog in and provide for the
future. Last month it at last dawned on
somebody that if Victoria didn’t get wheat
from somewhere before June millers would
have to shut down, and there wouldn’t be
any bread for the public, either at lOd. or
at 10s. the 41b. loaf. Then Private Enter-
prise definitely gave up the job and the
Government fossicked round and acquired
about half a million bushels from America
to go on with; and about twice that quan-
tity then remained to be _ secured. The
price is kept secret, but it is safe to sal’ it
won't be less than 75., and may easily be
a good deal more, which is at least Is. above
what it could have been bought for when the
scarcity was first ascertained. Private
Enterprise, however, failed once more in a
crisis, while the inactivity of the Peacock
Government will cost the State a lot of
money. Among other things it will cer-
tainly reduce the area under crop next sea-
son, the nrice of seed wheat being now so
outrageous.
The Captains.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Captains sailed from all the World —-
from all the world and Spain;
And each one for his country’s ease, her glory
and her gain;
The Captains sailed to Southern Seas, and
sailed the Spanish Main;
And some sailed out beyond the World, and
some sailed home again.
And each one for his daily bread, and bitter
bread it was,
Because of things they’d left at home —or
for some other cause.
Their wives and daughters made the lace to
deck the Lady’s gown,
Where sailors’ wives sew dungarees by many
a seaport town.
The Captains sailed in rotten ships, with
often rotten crews,
Because their lands were ignorant and
meaner than the ooze ;
With money furnished them by Greed, or by
ambition mean,
When, they had crawled to some pig-faced,
pig-liearted king or queen.
And when a storm was on the coast, and
spray leaped o’er the quays,
Then little Joan or Dorothy, or Inez or
Louise,
Would kneel her down on such a night beside
her mother’s knees,
And fold her little hands and pray for those
beyond the seas.
With the touching faith of little girls—the
faith by love embalmed —
They’d pray for men beyond the seas who
might have been becalmed.
For some will pray at Christ His feet, and
some at Mary’s shrine;
And some to Heathen goddesses, as I have
prayed to mine;
To Mecca or to Bethlehem, to Fire, or Joss,
or Sol,
And one will pray to sticks or stones, and
one to her rag doll.
But ice are stubborn men and vain, and
though we rise or fall,
Our children's prayers or women's prayers,
God knows we need them all!
And no one fights the bitter gale, or strives
in combat grim,
But, somewhere in the world, a child is
praying hard for him.
The Captains sailed to India, to China and
Japan.
They met the Strangers’ Welcome and the
Friendliness of Sian ;
The Captains sailed to Southern Seas, and
“wondrous sights” they saw—
The Rights of Man in savage lands, and law
without a law.
They learnt the truth from savages, and
wisdom from the wild,
And learned to walk in unknown ways, and
trust them like a child.
(The sailors told of monstrous things that
be where sailors roam....
But none had seen more monstrous things
then they had seen at home.)
They found new worlds for crowded folk
in cities old and worn,
And huts of hunger, fog and smoke in lands
by Faction torn.
(They found the great and empty lands
where Nations might be born.)
They found new foods, they found new
wealth, and newer ways to live,
Where sons might grow in strength and
health, with all that God would give., ; >
They tracked their ways through unknown
seas where Danger still i*-«*mains,
And sailed back poor and broken men, and
pome sailed back in chains.
But, bound or free, or ill or well, where’er
their sails were furled,
They brought to weary, worn-out lands glad
tidings from the World.
The Seasons saw our fathers come, their
flocks and herds increase;
They saw the old lands waste in War, the
new lands waste in Peace;
The Seasons saw new gardens made, they
saw the old lands bleed,
And into new lands introduced the curse of
Class and Creed.
They saw the birth of Politics, and all was
ripe for Greed.
And Mammon came and built his towers,
and Mammon held the fort:
Till one new land went dollar-mad, and one
went mad for Sport.
Where men for love of Science sailed in
rotten tubs for years,
To hang or starve, while nought availed a
wife or daughter’s tears—
Where men made life-long sacrifice for some
blind Northern Power,
Now Science sinks a thousand souls, and
sinks them in an hour.
You would be rich and great too soon —
have all that mortal craves;
The day may come ere you have lived, when
you’ll be poor and slaves.
You heeded not the warning voice, for Self
and Snort prevailed;
You yet might wish, in dust and dread,
those Captains had not sailed.

During the week the Drunk of Potsdam
smashed a mirror. The King of Saxony
was visiting him, apparently on a temper-
ance mission; but even in royal company
the Drunk was too far gone in his special
brand of d.t.’s to hold himself in. What
breed of contemptible little army he
fancied was crossing the glassware the
cable doesn’t mention; it simply says
that he flew ott tne handle and spoiled
the furniture. All other things of
much consequence that have happened
during the week have been merely
further incidents in the Imperial jim-jams.
In particular Bill has mounted the bar
and told the whole world to come on.
All neutral nations were warned that if
they attempted to do any trading whatever
with Britain their ships would be blown up
without regard for crews or passengers.
Even President Wilson is understood to
have left off nibbling his bath-bun to tell
the demented person on the bar that if he
talked like this and really blew up more than
about 20 United States vessels and crews,
he (Woodrow) would have to give him a
real hard talking-to. Meantime Wilson’s
newspapers begin to remark that if Bill
touches their dollars he touches their dig-
nity, and they will have to punch him;
whereupon Bill has presented the barman
with six Iron Crosses and announced that
he isn’t going to take any notice of any
protests, friendly or otherwise. It is an
interesting situation, and if Bill persists
President Wilson may have to throw the
remnants of the bun at him. It is unfor-
tunate from one point of view that Bill
may not be able to persist, having nothing
to persist with except a few submarines.
For the rest the Drunk’s emissaries in
Palestine and thereabouts continue to push
the Turks, who are mostly Arabs, towards
Egypt, and the Maorilanders and one sec-
tion of the Australians have welcomed them
on the banks of the Canal and brushed
their very torn and untidy clothes. Appar-
ently if the rest of the invaders make any
haste across the desert it will be to get a
square feed from an enemy that they don’t
dread half as much as starvation, aggra-
vated by German stripes. In Europe there
have been the usual small excursions. But
in northern Europe Februarv is a dark
month, full of sleet and misery ; and except
on the east, where nothing matters to hardy
Ivan, the week has been spent mostly in
looking forward to something that is to
happen in the spring.
N; S. Wales has always been the most rabid
State Rights community in Australia, and
when it was proposed to hand over the con-
trol of industrial legislation to the Common-
wealth, the most ferocious opponent was
Joseph Cook. Certainly, he voiced public
opinion as expressed at the Referendum, but
this merely proves that there are a lot of
blind people in N. S. Wales willing to be led
by a one-eyed man. Lately they have reaped
some of the harvest of their folly. The
Commonwealth wanted £19,370 worth of
military saddlery and harness, and called for
tenders. Now, the chief cost to be counted
in making a tender is that of labor. The
firms that tendered already had their plant
and their staffs. The sudden demand of the
military for equipment came as a welcome
windfall. It was merely a case of tendering
according to existing conditions. Naturally,
the question of celerity obtruded itself, and
to ensure it, the contract was offered to as
many firms as possible throughout the States.
But when the tenders were opened the mili-
tary people found that N. S. Wales in every
case had handed in the highest quotations.
The reason was obvious. In the Common-
wealth contracts the tenderers are bound to
pay the wages awarded by the State indus-
trial tribunals. In Sydney the price of
skilled labor in this trade is Is. 3d. per hour
all round, or £3 per week of 48 hours. The
Melbourne tribunal also awarded 60s. per
week, but suspended the award during war
time, or “till normal conditions resumed.”
So the Melbourne manufacturer gets his
labor at 545. per week for men and 245. for
women and girls. The rates in Adelaide
and Brisbane are lower still. The military
people had to do the best they could with
the Commonwealth’s money, and when the
work was distributed it worked out like
this:—
Adelaide, two firms . . . . £7093 13 3
Melbourne, eight firms . . 5316 3 10
Brisbane, four firms . . . . 4913 7 1
Sydney, five firms . . . . 2048 10 1
Discarding the odd money, Adelaide secured
36.6 per cent.; 27.4 per cent.;
Brisbane, 25.3 per cent.,; and silly old Syd-
ney, which upheld State Frights, 10.5 per
cent. The Bulletin is not sorry to see the
other States get a share of the work. It is
not angry because wages are high in Sydney.
It merely rises to point out to the blatant
State Frights employers who spent so much
money in defeating the Referendum that they
are now getting what they asked for.

♦
“High Jinks,” the latest J.C.W. light
musical show, now kicking cheerfully at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, is the usual French
comedy with its fangs drawn. There is
just enough left in it to suggest that, in its
original state, it must have been a death-
adder. There is, for instance, the passage-
at-arms between the pretty actress-nurse
and the elderly rich American, who has been
sent away in her charge by a doctor made
frivolous by a whiff of the wonder-working
“High Jinks” perfume. Finding that she
has registered as his wife at two hotels
(they have just been politely moved on from
the first), he strikes a virtuous attitude and
asks her what she means by it. “Why!”
she drawls amazedly, “I thought it was
expected of me!” The plot is quite simple
and conduces to hilarity. After one whiff
of the “High Jinks” raffing gas, everybody
becomes uproarious and morally irresponsible
and runs away with the other party. It is
the sort of central idea that would become
boresome if done to slow, yearning music
by a lot of staid, easy-going principals with
the fat of middle-age thick upon them. For-
tunately the music—of which there is a
good supply—is nearly all lively and tune-
ful, and the few Jinkers who are not young
and handsome have some other advantages.
Dorothy Brunton is the usual fluffy vision
in a cream-puff: part and a couple of songs,
one of which, a remembersome waltz, is
sung with taking ease. Her careful voice-
production is in delicate contrast to Marie
Eaton’s method of using her high soprano,
which is forced unpleasantly, especially in
a superfluous Faust burlesque several yards
too long. However, Miss Eaton’s acting is
uniformly good, and so is cheerful Florence
Yie’s. The fair and willowy Gertrude Glyn
as usual looms up in one or two gowns that
stun the stalls ; but a wide, sunny smile dis-
arms criticism. She almost succeeds in
being pathetic with a song in which large
rubber balloons are referred to as soap
bubbles. Field Fisher, 0- H. Workman and
W. H. Rawlins, the chief comedians, put
up a remarkably good plain-clothes perform-
ance. Rawlins is the best off for “fat,”
as the moral American invalid mentioned
above. Chris Wren (French waiter) and
Alfred Frith (burlesque Colonel) form a
good comedy second-line. Paul Plunket suc-
ceeds in being the sort of infatuated stage
Frenchman that numberless other actors
have failed to be; and the dainty little
Ylasta Novotna whirls gracefully with
partner Victor Lauschmann in a smart
third-act specialty. The mounting and
dresses are good, and the chorus and orches-
tra do their duty; but the Iron Crosses and
other decorations must be handed to the
14 capable principals.

There is no call in Melbourne for Govern-
ment regulation of melodrama prices these
times. The laws of gravity have lowered
the quartern loaf of melo-food down to 2s.- at
the King’s, and the early doors have gone,
seemingly. That is to say, the doors are
still there, but the bird no longer
uses them to blackmail the early
worm. After the panto, at the King’s
has come “The Confession,” and for
six nights only the Rev. J. J. Bartlett, an
R.C. parish priest, will faithfully perform
the Sacred Offices of his Calling in a rather
assertively self-righteous manner. Llis only
excuse for being so evidently proud of him-
self is the audience’s loud applause, which
falls at his feet in lumps whenever he refers
to his proper sense of duty. “The Confes-
sion” has the crudest little sketch- of a plot
that ever was. In the first act the Rev.
Bartlett’s brother Tom is arrested for a
murder that has just been committed by a
mixed-breed who came to the priest in a hurry
to get absolution for the crime ;' so the audi-
ence knows all about everything from' the
start. After the first act the. prisoner’s old
mother (who sounds no older than 25), and
his girl, and a hunchback lad (played by
our ancient friend Tom Cannam) and
others are engaged in believing Tom to be
as innocent as the audience. knows he is,
whilst the Rev. J.J.B. waits patiently for
the inevitable disclosure r qf the Spanish-
French-Canadian Dago’s guilt. Incidentally,
the drama is a temperance sermon as well as
a note of admiration for Father Bartlett.

respectable cleric in a moderately earnest

This week’s arrival of The Bulletin in
Melbourne was to be celebrated by a profes-
sional matinee of “Bought and Paid For” at
the Royal. The poignant and passionate
drama (advt.) in question continues to
travel on its notoriety, and the management
still offers £5 to the person who can most
tersely express a reasonable opinion on the
merits of Mr. and Mrs. Stafford’s judicious
separation.
At Melbourne Princess’s “The Beggar
Girl’s Wedding” is repeating the parable of
the foolish young man who takes a wife
named Bessie from Thames Embankment
society and suffers severely for his reckless
conduct. The female, it appears, has a gaol
record and a disreputable old father, and these
drawbacks are revealed coincidently with the
discovery of Bess in the arms of a member
of the Society of Polite Criminals. Eor her
indiscretion the damsel is thrown back on the
human ash-tip, whereupon she starts playing
the weeping Magdalen, while the absurd
husband butts into all the mischief that a
hardworking villain and his accomplice can
devise. The sensation of the show is Bess
and hubby’s temporary tenure of “The Cages
of Death,” from which they are rescued by
the strategy of the playwright, who wants
them for some superfluous later scenes. Bob
Inman, as the hero, and Miss Pearl Smith, as
the tearful Bess, pass through the vicissi-
tudes to the inevitable moist reunion ; and in
numerous displays of emotion give passable
imitations of our variable summer weather,
with its hot and muggy moments changing to
thundery conditions and showers. Richard
Bellairs and Miss Jean Robertson, the part-
ners in crime, are united by a common ina-
bility to depict Vice on the higher, plane.
Miss Helmrich and Arthur Albert, are moder-
ate providers of comic relief. Lyle Chris-
tian appears as an ungilded youth; Alf
Scarlett doubles the roles of a lawyer and a
debased remnant of the medical profesh..;
and Harry McLennan and Ward Lyons are
two coves with but a single shirt, two crooks
that pinch as one. “The Beggar GirFs Wed-
ding” finishes to-morrow. On Saturday G.
Willoughby Ltd. will feature another domes-
tic disturbance, “Married to the Wrong
Man.”

At Melb. Tivoli all people and things are as
they were a week ago, except that Odiva and
her slippery companions have now gone from
the place where their tank used to be. The
remaining old identities are mostly putting
in their last nights and matinees, for a
notable and extensive novelty is due on
Saturday. The Follies are coming to Mel-
bourne by way of Sydney, and the Tivoli
Follies, as is generally known among devotees
of vaudeville, combine the madness of a
revue with the insanity of a panto. Their
section of the entertainment comprises a
new assortment of legs, and covers 90
minutes of space in the programme.

“The Great Naval Mystery” is Hoyt’s big
three-part effusion at the National and
Olympia (Melb.) this week. It is the old,
old story of successful plan-filching brought
about. by Adam’s weakness for the apple,
but it contains some unusually exciting
features, and some highly embellished emo-
tion. The next-best item, “The Triumph
of Love,” is a burst of sentiment in a forest;
while a clever comedy picture shows the
\ itagraph actress, Ethel Turner, in several
striking imitations of well-known film iden-
tities.

The pomp and circumstance of war are
to be presented in kinemacolor at the Mel-
bourne Auditorium. The pictures are from
the Scala (London), are the latest word in
the art of colored motion-pictures, and Lloyd

topical interest. “The Fighting
horces of Europe” on land and
sea are to do their first flit
across the screen, in the Audi,
aforesaid, next Wednesday night.
ihe Naval Combat show, which boomed at
Jijarl s Court (London) in the peaceful days
of yore, is going to strike this country
presently, whilst the iron is red-hot. Dr.
Arthur Russell, of Hoyt’s Pictures (Melb.),
has got the patent and copyright of the Com-
bat for Australia, and a number of convinc-
ing miniature battleships have already been
built for the ingenious show. The scheme
of operations is astonishingly clever. All
sorts of horrors of naval warfare —with the
human casualties omitted —are worked into
the spectacle. When the Combat has been
made ready for action the management’s
trouble will be to find places suitable for
staging it — i.e., floating it —-on an adequate
scale. At Bari’s Court, where naval officers
conducted the warfare, there were 5000
square yards of water for the boats to per-
form on.
Adelaide shows are mostly pictures just
now. The weather has been all against
indoor frolics. Royal and Tivoli are closed,
and even the King’s is taking a vacation,
after a successful week with the football-
playing elephant and the educated ape. At
n est’s is a Napoleonic fighting film, and
Wondergraph imagines a German invasion
ot England. In the open the Strollers and
the Dandies are as they were before—or
more so, if anything.
The first lock and weir planned by South
Aus. in connection with the big scheme for
the improvement of the Murray has struck
a snag at starting. After advertising for
tour months, the Government got only four
tenders, and even the lowest price named was
considered so unreasonably high that the
work will be advertised again.
Prank Pox, one-time a sub-editor of The
Bulletin in his spare moments and an
enthusiastic lieutenant of Field Artillery
at others, has given up his press job at the
front .to take a commission again with

correspondent Fox watched the Gerhogs pour
into. Brussels. He was one of the last
Britishers to leave the city, and what he
saw in those days left him uncomfortable

Australia,, by the way, owes something to
I ox for his strenuous advocacy of universal
training at a time when it had very few

AT POVERTY POINT.
Beaumont Smith believes in the Aus-
tralian drama. He tried it on the dingo
with “Seven. Little Australians,” and the
dingo came in mobs. Now he has secured
the rights of another kiddie play, by Arthur
H. Adams, for production in Sydney at
midwinter. This play, not yet christened,
had its genesis in the urgent request of a
small boy of four. He had howled through
three acts of the usual “children’s” panto-
mime,. the only part of which he confessed
to liking was the thrilling inter-act “where
the kind lady brought round the chocolates.”
The author asked him if he would like a
children’s play written for himself, and the

kiddie, who is the real author, immediately
laid down his ideas about the ideal kiddie
play, and ruthlessly sub-edited the panto-
mime as it was read out to him. The cast
includes animals, children, fairies and dolls ;
and the stage settings and properties, which
will prove the most expensive feature of the
production, aim at carrying out a unique
stage illusion.
“Mrs. Pretty and the Premier,” by
Arthur H. Adams, produced last year by
the Melbourne Repertory Theatre, and sub-
sequently by the Sydney Repertory Theatre,
has been purchased by Arthur Bourcbier,
whose wife is Violet Vanbrugh, for produc-
tion in London.
“Kaniva”: English letters report the
death of Emma Bronton, who appeared in
H. W. Emmet’s panto, of “Sinbad” at Mel-
bourne Opera House in 1884, and after-
wards joined the Brough-Boucicault Co.
and remained with it for a long time. She
was q. hard worker, and with another of the
old brigade, Polly Emery, was engaged in
stage life almost to the end, which came,
after a day’s illness, at 53. One of her sons,
Jack Brandon, has written many sketches
and a couple of short plays.
In a pamphlet issued for the protection of
the charitable, a Sydney church claims to
have got on the track of a master cadger
who “has an extensive repertoire of skil-
fully-constructed and wholly-false tales of
woe, and tells them with an engaging sin-
cerity that would melt the heart of a bronze
statue.” The Bulletin doesn’t know who
the cadger is. but is willing to bet that he
isn’t one of the regular stars. There are no
statue-melters amongst them at present.
Some statistics on the subject of actors
at the front were given at a dinner in
London to thank Herbert Tree for handing
over the profits of the latest run of the
patriotic “Drake” to the War Relief Fund
and the .Actors’ Benevolent Fund—£lol7 to
each. Six hundred English actors have
joined the colors, it was said, and 200 are
in training. This is exclusive of recruits
from the business staffs. Apropos of nothing,
Sir Herbert Tree’s real name is Beerbohm :
he is of German parentage, and has played
in Berlin in the Hogman or Gerhog lan-
guage.
Lily Dampier, Alfred’s elder daughter,
died in Melbourne on Saturday. Born at
Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Eng.) in January,
1869, she made her first appearance in
Dunedin (M.L.) in her father’s drama of
“Saint or Sinner.” She was a mere baby
at the time. Dad came to Australia in
1873, and was for three years at the Mel-
bourne Royal. Then he toured Australia and
Maoriland. During that period Lily married
Alfred Rolfe, who was one of her father’s
young men. She and sister Rose were both
popular as juveniles. Yet Lily at any rate
might have done better had she stuck to
the piano. Her mother (then known as
Miss Alice. Russell) was in a fair way to
become. quite famous when she left for
Australia, and the daughter had large
talents of the same sort.
“Kaniva”: Herbert Tree has suited the
warlike times by producing “King Henry
IV.” (part 1) in London. Matheson Lang
played Hotspur, and Tree was Falstaff.
Half a century ago Barry Sullivan produced
the play twice at the Sydney Royal. The
first time, in September, 1863, he had this
cast: King Henry, G. R. Ireland ; Hotspur,
Robert Heir; Falstaff, Barry Sullivan.
Others were Mrs. Heir. Mrs. A. Phillips,
Alec Fitzgerald and Charles Young. In
July, 1864, Sullivan played Hotspur, and
was excellent in the part; naturally regard-
ing it as the leading one; but J. C. Lam-
bert’s Falstaff captured the audience. His
make-up was. marvellous. He was the em-
bodiment of joviality, bombast, humor and
audacity, irrepressible and resourceful, and
ms acting was so earnest, natural and real-
istic that the spectators were quite carried
away. . The cast otherwise was the same as
m 1863. In 1878 Creswick produced the
Play, he taking Falstaff. It was a rare
performance on his part, but the backing
was not as artistic as Sullivan had.
J- M. Barrie’s latest one-acter, “The
Day, ’ produced at London Coliseum, is a
skit on the German militarists and the toast
they have been drinking for years: “The
Day We Will I,and in Ijjngland.” In peace
times no European mpnarch may be imper-
sonated or burlesqued on the London stage ;
but when one of them becomes an enemy the
censor winks. So Barrie has been allowed
to make the Kaiser a leading character in
his playlet. Besides the Imperial Bandit
the only character that counts is the Spirit
of Culture, impersonated by Irene Vanburgh,
who has some smart satirical lines. America
so.dotes on Barrie that the New York Times
printed “The Day” simultaneously with its
first production in London, and paid Barrie
2s. Id. a word for the privilege.
“J.F.H.”: In J. M. Barrie’s new playlet,
I he Day,” the curtain comes down on Irene
Vanbrugh as the Spirit of Culture handing
something to the Kaiser. What it was
nobody knew at the first performance. Some
said a revolver, others a dagger, and a grace-
less joker in the gallery thought it was a
banana. But the mystery was solved next
morning with the publication of the text.
Barrie’s final stage direction reads: “She
lifts a pistol from the table and puts it in
his hand. She goes away with shining eyes.
Ihe penny dip burns low. The Emperor is
lost in its shadows.” The Pall Mall
Gazette :calls this pistol business a “false
touch, and. William Archer, the Queens-
lander who is dramatic critic of the Stak,
says the same : “It is neither good taste nor
good sense for the Spirit of Culture to hand
the Emperor a pistol as the curtain falls,
and leave him gazing down its blue barrel.”
Certainly it does seem a risk to take He

“U.S.”: Josephine Cohan, Fred Niblo’s
wife, is sister of George Cohan, one of the
leading New York dramatists and producers.
Their parents were Mr. and Mrs. Jerry
Cohan, who came to Australia many years
ago with an entertainment called the Hiber-
nicon, composed of acting, singing, dancing
and panorama of Ireland. There was an
imitative rival, also in Australia, called the
Hibernica, managed by little H. A. B. Wil-
liams. Jerry Cohan, now a grave, spec-
tacled gent., was celebrated for dancing. He
resolved that his wife must have' nothing to
do with the stage, so he took a girl who had
never been to a theatre. But Jerry found
himself in a hole through the secession of
the Hibernicon lady. Said she scornfully:
“Try your wife.” Thus challenged, Mrs.
Jerry went on, having only seen the show
from the front, and stopped on. They had
the luck of never being separated except
once for three months. Mrs. Jerry’s photo,
before me, shows everlasting youth, Yet
they had sometimes to give five shows a day!
“Busk”; “D” writes (B. 21/1/T5) about
Bernhardt and Ellen Terry having retired
from the stage; but really it retired from
them. This is the usual way. Whenever
such veteran favorites make a fitful appear-
ance, for a benefit, they are received with
a shout which they misinterpret into an
idea that they .would be welcome all the
time. Genuine retirements are consequently
few. Forbes-Robertson’s appears to be one.
Yet even he would come to Australia if he
could agree with Tallis, Ward and Meynell
as to his value.
James Dalgarno, a former Under-Sec. of
the P.M.G.’s Department (N.S.W.), died
on Sunday, aged 78. His father, a sea-
captain, sailed the Funchal between Mauri-
tius and Sydney in the ’3o’s. In that decade
the old man gave up seafaring and
“squatted” at Mudgee, then sparsely peopled
by assigned servants, ticket-of-leave men,
and a few others. Severe droughts drove
him back to Sydney, where he got a job as
wharfinger. He had two sons —John, who
was an electrician in the Government ser-
vice ; and James, who was in the postal
service all his working life. Outside that
James took a keen interest in the Historical
Society, and he dabbled in oils with con-
siderable success.
“Zwanzeur,” concerning an unlucky old
lady;—
“R.5.V.P.,” in a recent Bulletin, quotes from
McHugh’s book on modern Mexico that Princess
Charlotte, the widow of Maximilian, “died in a mad-
house some years ago.” This is incorrect. Late in
1911 I was at the chateau, near Brussels, where she
was then confined, and I am confident that had she
died subsequently her death would have been
announced, as she is the last link with the Mexican
tragedy of the ’6o’s. For about 40 years Charlotte
was a carefully-watched resident of the royal
demesne of Jervuereii, then almost a suburb of the
Belgian capital, The castle was destroyed by fire,
and it was whispered that the exalted prisoner was
responsible. She was then removed to the chateau,
where surveillance could be more strictly exercised.
On the site of the ruins of Jervueren Leopold 11.,
her brother, built the beautiful Congo Museum, and
presented it to the nation, together with the delight-
ful park which surrounds it, and is part of the
forest of Soignies. The sympathy of the Belgians
for their king’s daughter, the victim of the Mexican
fiasco, has always been mixed with a bitter feeling
that she was instrumental in the appeal for volun-
teers to swell the inadequate French expeditionary
force under General Bazaine, which failed to subdue
Mexico, though it cost many Belgian lives.
“Binnacle”: The other day N. S. Wales
shipowners called on Minister for Customs
Tudor to obtain certain exemptions for ves-
sels running under the new Navigation Act.
Amongst other things they wanted to escape
the clause which makes the installation of
wireless compulsory, and advanced as a
reason that Morse lamps, used on a head-to-
head run, in conjunction with the light-
houses, would be sufficient for all require-
ments. It is a rotten contention. During
the last five years the Rosedale, Macleay.
Yongala and Koombana have all been lost
on a head-to-head run, and no man knowetli
where their bones bleach. Likewise, Aus-
tralia’s trawler, the Endeavor, was not
fitted with wireless. Doubtless she had
lamps for Morse signalling, but, so far, the
signals haven’t been observed.
From a man with nearly 50 years’ Mel-
bourne press experience behind him :
Mayor Hennessy rises to the occasion. “Nobody
is to be hungry,” he says, and means it. I will
rank that with the best thing ever uttered in Aus-
tralia. This was Mort’s: “There shall be no more
waste,” when Nicolle had shown him how to do
the freezing. Nor does Hennessy propose to trans-
fer his burden to the Salvation Army or make any
sort of religious side-show of it. I never saw the
outlook gloomier. Remember that the wheat har-
vest, which means more to Victoria than to N. S.
Wales, was three times poorer than the Ma State’s.
N. S. 'Wales grew 41 bushels for every 100 it had
in the previous year ; Victoria reaped only 12. The
gold industry is sick; the fruit crop was a rank
failure. An acquaintance, thrown out of work in
Melbourne, went to a country town of third grade
and found 300 out-of-works on the police list. And
we know that things can get no better for most of
the year. It is the biggest thing a Melbourne
Mayor has had to do since December, 1854, when
John Thomas Smith rose to his occasion. News was
brought by horsemen of Eureka Stockade. A rumor
arose that the diggers, thousands strong, were
marching on Melbourne. Mayor Jacky Tommy
Smith issued a Universal Service order, and fol-
lowed the order up. This was what secured him his
seven terms and made .him Melbourne’s Whit-
tington.
THE HIGH-TONED PANTO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cinderella is a high-toned story, wherein all the
characters are connected with the aristocracy.—
“Sundry Shows” (4/2/’l5).
The highbrow sat in his high-priced seat,
Quite near to the orchestra-railing;
To get close up when a panto.’s on
Is ever a human failing!
He glimpsed the high-kickers through his glass,
Though his hair was scant and hoary,
So I said to him: “Mr. Highbrow, I’m
Surprised you should patronise pantomime!”
Said he: “They are mostly waste of time,
But —this is a high-toned story !
“High art’s in this tale of the slipper of glass,
That is put so deftly before us.”
(Swift to his eyes went the lenses here,
For there entered the “beauty-chorus.”)
“No one is of lowly parentage,
And in birth and rank I glory:
And a high-born Baron’s whole familee
We’re seldom permitted, m.v friend, to see,
And these limbs of the aristocracee
Give—well, it's a hig,.-^o.. iU si,ory!
This temple of song and eke of dance,
What person, could ever be sad in?
It’s different quite with those vulgar tales,
‘Crusoe,’ ‘Sinbad’ and ‘Aladdin’ ;
Though I dote of Sudermann, Ibsen, Shaw,
You will find me commendafory
Of the high note struck by this beauteous show—
Excuse me, the ballet’s on now, you know! ”
Here he focussed a fay in the very front row,
And was lost in the high-toned story 1

A strange story comes from England of
a man with two late wives, both of whom
washed themselves. His name is George
Smith, and he is charged in London with
making a false entry in a marriage regis-
ter. It is alleged that his first wife was
found dead in a bath a few weeks after
marriage, and that his second wife died in
the same place the day after her marriage.
Smith himself wasn’t found in the bath, so
far as the evidence shows, either dead or
alive, or before marriage or after marriage.
Smith, it is said, used to be a land agent,
which is a suspicious circumstance and calls
for much investigation, if land agents in
England are anything like what they used to
be in Australia.
The misguided patriots who lately pro-
vided eight travelling kitchens for the Vic.
Light Horse Brigade are now kicking them-
selves with both feet. These camp-cookers,
costing £lBO each, have been ticketed useless
for active service, and are now hiding in a
shed somewhere. Cabled reports of travel-
ling kitchens in the German lines are re-
sponsible for the fiasco. Nobody knew much
about the manufacture of such things,
apparently; nevertheless a blacksmith, or
farrier, or other unqualified person went
ahead with the job. If he had consulted his
wife it might have been better. Anyway,
as “Johanna’s” ribald remarks suggested
after the first parade of the things, woman s
eye at once detected flaws which turn out
to be as fatal as they looked.

A Ballarat P.M. recently laid down the
law as to goats and the destruction thereof.
The goat is notoriously the Prussian of the
animal kingdom, wherefore he is frequently
potted, shelled, bombed or otherwise de-
stroyed by outraged civilisation. The trouble
with the particular goat which caused the
Ballarat argument was that, having been
shot, he didn’t die promptly, but perversely
lingered for 10 minutes or so awaiting the
ambulance. Therefore the S.P.C.A. sum-
moned the artillery for cruelty to animals.
The P.M. opined that the question was:
“Did the defendant shoot the goat carefully
and with skill?” and finding that he did, the
Court acquitted him —with £2 2s. costs.
* * * *
Recently somebody grumbled that, if the
tales of Gerhog atrocities in Belgium were
true, the medical papers would have said
something. Probably the reason they haven’t
said much is that the men who could write
have been too busy attending to the Butcher’s
victims. However, here is part of the
Lancet’s report of an address delivered to
the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society by Pro-
fessor Jacobs, of Brussels, the head of the
Belgian Red Cross :
I met a doctor who had not eaten bread for a fort-
night, living only on potatoes. Some had to lie on
straw for beds. One had his only pair of boots on
his feet, and these falling to pieces; others had only
torn garments to clothe themselves with. One had to
live for three days on wayside herbs, and his wife
shared his fate. Another was searching in vain for
six or seven days for his wife and family in the
country around. Some doctors had been imprisoned
as hostages; some had been shot. One, the burgo-
master of a place near Liege, was seized, had his ears
cut off, his eyes gouged out, and was then shot;
afterwards his head was carried on the end of the
lance of an Uhlan through the town. There were
widows and orphans of doctors deprived of every-
thing. A doctor and his son were shot before the
eyes of the wife. As head of the Belgian Red Cross
I visited a chateau, but found the Red Cross had
not been respected; it had been completely destroyed
and the bodies of six girls, aged from 10 to 17, were
lying on the lawn. A convent containing 60 sisters
had been entered by the German soldiers and every
one had been violated ; on the evidence of the doctor
to the institution 25 were pregnant. I had operated
on the wife of a doctor living near Namur. Three
weeks after the operation, when convalescing and
still in bed, their house was entered by German sol-
diers ; she was raped by seven of them and died two
days afterwards.
Is that enough?
THE BAD DEBT.
DEPARTING PUPIL: “Ah, Professor! How can I ever thank you? I [?] everything I
know to you."
PROFESSOR : “Madam! Please do not mention such a trifle."
ILLOGICAL.
Many would-be recruits complain that their services are declined because of their lack of inches.
SHORT PATRIOT (to recruiting officer): “Gam, there ain't no sense in it. You [?]use
to take us short blokes, and send them long coves to the from to be cut off short."
The impressions thus far of a Maoriland
surgeon, conveyed' to his recent fellow-
traveller, “Hop” :
When only three weeks in England war was
declared. A r olunteering for the front, I was sent
out with the pioneer British Expeditionary Force,
and was among the first to land at Havre. Follow-
ing that, I had my share, of course, of the retreat
and all the bitterness that it meant—back, back
before the strong German advance. At last! A
long breather, and, like a thunderbolt, we were
hurled forward, and with a bloody rush won the
Battle ..of the Marne. We crossed the bridge at 7
p.m., still under a pitiless fire. All that night I
was operating on the scene of the morning’s battle.
Rapidly sending our wounded to the rear we were
on the march again by four o’clock next morning,
relentlessly following the rapidly-retreating Ger-
man. During those inspiriting days what captures
there were of prisoners, arms, batteries, equipment!
The march was across one of the fairest lands in the
world, but dotted now with the abandoned corpses
of Germans. Every hamlet breathed romance; but
it was not for us in this grim walk.
Then rain fell pitilessly and the roads were lines
of mud. The fair land became a sodden landscape,
with a pall of driving, lowering clouds. All sombre
and dark and threatening and very mournful. That
was the stage setting ; and the rattle of the rifle-fire,
the typewriter note of the Maxim, the whistle of the
shrapnel, the smashing bursts of the high explosives
made a devil’s orchestra. This went on for days, of
which we lost count —we pursuing ; marching night
and day; very exhausted, but very cheery, because
we were advancing in the good old British way.
Then the River Aisne and a pause. You know about
the battle that followed. You know its tales of
hard fighting in the rain, of its desperate bayonet
attacks at night, of its artillery combats, of its long
list of wounded, dying and dead. It was my fate to
know much of the last, for I was in constant touch
with the 6th Division, who, though smashed badly,
so gloriously held the country on the far side of
the valley.
Next we suddenly appeared in the north-east of
France at La Bassee, and later at Ypres. And here
I am to-day on Belgian soil.
The fighting all along has been most sanguinary
and stubborn. Oh, we are proud men! British
history is punctuated with stories of the heroism
and the bulldog fighting of British soldiers. But in
our island story there is nothing to excel—no,
nothing to equal—the tenacity of our soldiers in the
field to-day, hanging on against foes outnumbering
them by four to one. When they have retired, they
have done it so doggedly, dealing death with a piti-
less sleet of lead and with bayonet attacks that set
you wondering whether they were men or devils.
How magnificently, they all have upheld the nima of
the Anglo-Saxon only we who have seen them can
quite realise.
We feel the cold very much, and are waiting for
the spring to advance across the Rhine. I am not
vindictive, but I hope to see, before my days are
ended, a German city in ruins. I wish Germans to
know what it is to have their homes destroyed. I
do not wish to carry the German method of killing
defenceless women and children. Far from that.
But I am barbarian enough to enjoy the sight of
wrecked German railways and warehouses and
chateaux. I have seen these in France and Belgium,
and I am not civilised enough yet to forego the
doctrine of a tooth for a tooth. Needless to say,
from the surgical point of view, I have been busy.
Our wounded are getting the best possible care at
the front. In the stress of violent military opera-
tions it is frequently impossible to do all that one
would like to do for them. But that is understood.
I think it was Macaulay who said that the “essence
of war is violence,” and if he said that he knew
what he was talking about. But to violence we are
adding things that even Macaulay knew nothing
about.
* * * *
“Enid McGush”: The S. M. Herald
quotes the letter of a trooper in Egypt: — 1
Everything was very interesting to us at first, but
the novelty has worn off now, and we long to get
away and do our bit of fighting and return to dead
old Sydney.
Has it come to this? Is Sydney actually
“dead” by comparison with the land of the
Pharaohs and Ptolemies? Perhaps after the
war we may be able to make a living by
showing the ruins of the G.P.O. to smart
young Egyptian tourists, who come from a
land where railways have a uniform gauge
and ports are open to bring goods to their
nearest market.
Of all foolish customs there is none more
utterly goatish than that which makes it
an act of heroism for a captain to sink with
his ship. The other day a French sub-
marine got into trouble, but managed to
land its crew. Instead of getting away to
fight again and help his country out in her
struggle, the commander climbed up on the
periscope or pimple of his vessel, struck a
pose, and fed himself to the iEgean sharks.
A man like that deserves his sharks. Also
there sould be a monument of mud erected
to him somewhere with a wild ass tethered
to it.
WHEN THE GERMAN HOPE WENT DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Seydlitz was a silent ship steaming desper-
ately for shelter.
Over the sea, the grey, unhurrying sea,
Brightening'beneath the January sun,
The grim, gigantic Dreadnoughts turn and flee
Before the vengeful foe. And as they run
With Parthian hate they answer gun with thunder-
ing gun !
Swift overhead the aircraft dive and swoop ;
Beneath the wave there glides the submarine,
Like some enormous porpoise, and a troop
Of lean destroyers dull the morning sheen
With webs of smoke that form the shifting battle-
screen.
Giant is met by giant in this hour 1
The race is to the swift and to the strong.
Flung into fight, regardless, is the power —
Yea, unto strength the battle doth belong !
Hark! Where the Titan-guns roar forth their
triumph-song!
Britain, the ancient Mistress of the Seas,
In her fond-guarded waters hears anew
The challenge of a foe who fights and flees,
And, fleeing, is foredone with ship and crew —
Who, threatening all things, fails, and knows not
what to do!

“The Old Soldier”: Touching those re-
ported cases of desertion from the contin-
gents, let us differentiate. The crime is a
trivial one as it is perpetrated nowadays.
As practised by the “bounty-jumpers” of the
British and United States armies of 50 or 60
or more years ago, it was not only disloyalty
but fraud. In the Crimean War cash boun-
ties of £5 and upwards, with a free kit, were
given to recruits to tempt them to enlist.
Numbers of them deserted at the first chance,
and annexed another bounty and free-kit
from the next recruiting party they met.
The free-kit did not amount to much, but
the money was a consideration. The. few
who have deserted here have probably done
so, not for such sordid gains, but because
they found the conditions of life in the con-
tingent were intolerable to them for some
reason. _ In brief, they discovered that they
were misfits; and they were then uncon-
sciously doing the country a good turn by
getting out, for a misfit is a calamity in
war-time.

“Chudah”: There are 6000 pros-
perous Jewish farmers in the United States,
and they have just been holding a conference
in New York, which has 1000 of them.
The burning question
was whether they
ought to raise hogs.
The conference de-
cided, on Rabbinical
advice, that pigs,
though not desirable,
were allowable. There
is nothing in Moses to
proscribe breeding for
the Gentile. Indeed,
I think the evidence
of Leviticus is that
the Jews had pigs,
under the care of that
individual so often re-
ferred to as the stran-
ger. That estimable
Melbourne citizen, the
late Israel Jacobs,
was ardent for young
Jews to go on the
land, and mainly sup-
ported a colony of
them at Shepparton.
Said he: “Our ances-
tors, you know, were
shepherds. We learnt
our present ways
among the Babylo-
nians.” Hereby hangs
a tale. An Australian
city has three suburbs,
straggling one after
the other, nicknamed
Bricktown, Porktown
and Torntown. A
lady used to hold the
nig business of Pork-
town in her masterly
fingers. She was the
main support of a fine
local church known
as the Cathedral. One
Sunday the preacher,
who knew nothing of
the local industry,
incidentally touched
on the 2000 demons
entering the swine.
Finding the reference
to pigs caught on, he
proceeded to expound the fearful diseases
engendered by pork-eating—trinchinopolis,
elephantiasis, quadratics and goodness knows
what. The Queen took him in hand after-
wards.
* The Adelaide City Council has just
“scrapped” the first building ever erected on
“the Corporation acre” —a single-storey
stone structure which has lately served as
the messenger’s quarters. The first Council
(1840) had to hire a place to meet in, and
this modest building was the first Council-
room and offices of its own. Now it is to
be smothered by additions to the present
Town Hall block to cost £ll,OOO.
“Coot” : The Maternity Bonus Department
has to investigate some remarkable cases,
but this one is reckoned the most bewilder-
ing yet looked into. A claim was received
from a mother for the five pounds in respect
of an infant, and, the papers being all in
order, the sum was paid. A few weeks later
she made a claim for another fiver for a
child born one month after the first one, and
submitted the usual proofs. The astounded
officials made inquiries, and the doctor
attending the mother assured them that two
babies had been born, and that a month had
elapsed between the births. The Depart-
ment got over the difficulty by pronouncing
the infants to be twins, and so declined to
pay the second five-pound note —which seems
rather hard on the mother. Moral: Don’t
have twins, except singly, and then arrange a
reasonable interval between their birthdays.
* * * *
The “Song of Hate” is not the first fam-
ous German love-lyric of the kind. Indeed,
it Avas probably suggested by the “Song of
Hatred” of the revolutionist Georg Herwegh,
whose “Poems of a Living Man” were once
well known. Herwegh’s “Song of Hatred”
was of a tyrannicidal character —that is to
say, it eulogised the man who gave “one last
kiss to the wife and child” and took a “firm,
tight grip of the poniard.” It was greatly
admired by the Young Ireland Party, and
was translated by J. Clarence Mangan, the
revolutionary poet. The refrain of that
translation was:—
For we’ve had more than enough of love;
So now for a spell of hatred.
Years after the original publication of
Clarence Mangan’s version, when Johann
Most had settled in London and was prose-
cuted for eulogising the assassination of
the Tsar Alexander, he republished “The
Song of Hatred,” together with Beacons-
field’s “Revolutionary Epick,” and other
poems that were thought to justify tyranni-
cide. Herwegh was a pretty thorough-going
revolutionist. In 1848 he raised a military
force which invaded Baden; but the enter-
prise failed, and Herwegh had to flee to
Switzerland. It was in those days and out
of that and similar movements that S. Aus-
tralia got the German refugees who laid the
foundations of the present big settlements
with the Teuton names.
MINIMISING THE RISK.
“Oh, no; let's just keep on being engaged.”
“Why?”
“Because the longer we're engaged the less
time there's left for us to be married in.”
Early in December a Berlin newspaper
was advertising special five-day trips through
devastated Belgium to enable sightseers to
enjoy the devil-work of their soldiers in
Liege, Dinant and Namur. Evidently Bel-
gium was butchered to make a German
holiday.
From the Ardrossan (Scotland) Herald :
The Rev. W. R. Thompson, of Bellshill, took as
his text on Sunday evening: “It’s a long, long way to
Tipperary,” and the tune was played as a closing
voluntary.
The ghost of John Knox has no terrors for
that cleric!
WHILE PLUMES
ARE ALL THE GO.
M AY: “No, George, it cannot
be. I am not good enough
to be your wife.”
GEORGE: “What nonsense, dear! You are
an angel.”
MAY : “George, even an angel could not be
happy with a matt who had only £250
a year, and feathers the price they are.”
It is interesting to watch that habitual
striker, the Northern (N.S.W.) miner, when
he is struck against. The Bungs of Kurri
Kurri declined to go on working their beer-
pumps at the old price. The miners retali-
ated by locking the publicans out. They
wouldn’t have the beer at the increased
money, and they hung on to that till the
strikers got very tired and offered the poison
at the old price. Then the capitalist miners
spoke in the cld, familiar way: the whole
business having been opened up, it was now a
question not of restoring the old rate, but of
fixing a fair rate; and they reckoned this
fair rate was three ha’pence a half-pint.
Human nature is pretty much the same no
matter whether it calls its meeting-place a
club or a trades hall.
Grand Master Snowball,
M.L.A., Victoria’s Orange
lodger, has discovered the
secret of German militarism,
the cause of the German
navy, the meaning of the
Kaiser’s ultimatum to Holy
Russia, and the origin of the
late Paul Kruger’s objec-
tions to the British flag. “It
is proved beyond doubt,”
said the astounding Snow-
ball to an Orange picnic,
“that the war in South
Africa was owing to a desire
on the part of the Jesuits to
break up the British Em-
pire, whilst the present war
is owing to a campaign by
the Jesuits, who have suc-
ceeded in embittering the
German nation against the
English.” These are the
oddest clods that Snowball
ever ploughed up from his
field of political research.
What the Jesuits had to do
in S’Africa with the Zulu
rising in The ’7o’s, the dis-
covery of diamonds and gold,
the subsequent Jameson raid
and the greed of Jewhannes-
burg, is just as
evident as their
connection with
the Prussian at-
tack on Rom a n
Catholic Belgium
and France, and
the subseouent
world-conquest pre-
parations of the
Protestant of Pots-
dam. A Snowball
at an L.O.L. boan
feast is in the same
happy position as a
parson in a pulpit.
Nobody expects
him to draw a line
of reasoning through the centre of his alle-
gations. He just says things, and the
congregation disperses with a sense of hav-
ing been further confirmed in its belief.
There are some quaint streaks of sim-
plicity or credulity mixed with the cunning
of Hans Bludwurst. As a case in point,
an obscure Gerhog paper called Father-
land recently came out with an article
urging Canada, Ireland, Australia and
Maoriland to rise against Britain and
“throw off the yoke.” The idea of over
6,000,000 square miles of country throwing
off the yoke on the invitation of a very-
little-known organ printed in a foreign lan-
guage has an element of humor. Also it
seems a waste of ink.

“Melb” : The astute Archdeacon Bindley,
the real power behind the throne in this
archdiocese, is just back from England. He
has engaged some great unknown genius, of
the Ditchfield order, who is to take charge of
the St. James’s, St. John’s and St. Peter’s
missions. No, no—Australia cannot furnish
such ! Only the camel jobs for Australians!
Yet Ilindley himself gives that theory the
lie. He, the most commanding figure in the
diocese, has had all his experience in it.
Here it was he became a deacon in 1880, and
was admitted to orders two years later.
Since he came, to his days of power he has
invented three dioceses —Bendigo, Gippsland
and Wangaratta—and yet has refused to
take any. He is author of Melbourne’s
anomaly that the Archdeacon is above the
Dean. Stephen was, and Godby is, putty.
Dean Vance, with £llOO a year out of St.
James’s £9OOO or so, really was a Dean;
but he had the chagrin of knowing that, to
all intents and purposes, the billet was to
perish with him. However, the two arches,
Clarke and Hindley, want to remove the
scandal that St. James’s and St. John’s are
only loafing rent-collectors, like the mori-
bund Collins-street Independent Church;
so these parishes are to be centres of what
the church . terms work. But the funds,
brethren, are none too secure. A lot more
hopeless-looking shops have just been put up
at St. Jack’s.

LITTLE LADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Little Lady! Little Lady! you’ve a very winsome
face,
And your white-winged hat is dainty—and it’s quiet;
You’ve a sweet, reposeful manner and you move and
talk with grace,
And your dress, although it’s smart, is not a riot.
AVhile you chat across the table I am stealing looks
at you—
Your expressions are distracting, like your eyes of
tender blue.
Yours is not a strident beauty—l discovered you by
chance;
Now the women all about you do not matter.
There is something vivid in you—some suggestion of
far France,
But —you’ve got your checks! You’re going? (Oh,
the chatter!)
Life is full of these small partings, tiny breaks that
leave a scar.
Little Lady! Little Lady! Now, I wonder who you
are?

FRUIT SALAD.
AN EARLY VICTORIAN LADY TO HER TOOTH-
LESS SWAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ask me no more without your teeth!
Cease, sir, your toothless wooing!
’Midst battle-flames seek Glory’s wreath
And teeth to aid your chewing.
I can’t abide your British gums
Through which each mangled fond vow hums.
Ask me no more to give my hand
To one whose fangs are missing,
For toothless suitors I have banned
Because I hate their hissing.
Then, too, it makes me ill and weak
To see a gallant’s sunken cheek.
I beg that you will dry your tears!
Speak not of self-destruction,
Mumbling like one of ninety years
And killing sighs with suction.
Come! if you love me, smile with glee,
For toothless weeping vexes me!
The swain condemned to bread and slops,
Though he grow thin and lanky,
May go and grow tobacco crops
And come back as a Yankee,
Who needs no teeth. (They tell me those
Americans talk through the nose.)
So forth, Sir Knight, and learn this art,
Then you’ll no more offend me.
AYeep not, but play the hero’s part,
And Indian relics send me.
Farewell! No, sirrah, not my lips
AVith toothless gums. My fingertips!
Alas, poor creature! he is off
To brave his perils blindly!
If savages his scalp should doff
And deal with him unkindly,
I can’t be blamed, because, you see,
His bare gums shock my modesty.

WARNING TO DYSPEPTICS.
Many interesting paragraphs have recently
appeared in the press concerning the remark-
able antacid properties possessed by Bisu-
rated Magnesia, and thousands of people
now regularly take half a teaspoonful of the
preparation in a little water after their
meals as a safeguard against indigestion,
dyspepsia, heartburn, flatulence, lt
appears, however, that in several instances
other forms of magnesia, bearing somewhat
similar names, have been used, often wita
very unpleasant results. To guard against
dangerous substitution and to ensure getting
the genuine produce as recommended hi
physicians, readers should ask their chemist
distinctly for pure Bisurated Magnesia, and
insist on being supplied in bottles having the
full name —Bisurated Magnesia— blown in
the glass.*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
Dr. W. L. Cleland left the Adelaide
mental hospital” (formerly lunatic asylum)
: n February 1. after presiding over it for
36 years. He is only just 68, but feels he
; as earned a rest from the depressing pro-
fession. The K.C. and the winemaker (’le-
nds are brothers of the doctor, who is
onnected also with the Davenports, the
oioneers of olive-growing in Australia. Dr.
Downey, his deputy, becomes Acting-Super-
intendent at Parkside.
JENSEN , Assistant Minister for Defence.
“Moana”: A recent par. (B. 14/1/T5)
accused Kitchener of having only one hobby
—flower gardening. Please charge golf
against him as well. He has taken to the
game or business recently, and is suspected
of having the makings of a first-class player
concealed about him.
There are cases in which even the doctor
is out of place in a sick-room. A Queens-
town (Tas.) medico was sitting on a
patient's bed the other day. when he sud-
denly fell back dead. Death can lie a ghastly
humorist at times without going to the war
to play jokes. By the way. the deceased,
Dr. Massey, had two sons with the Aus-
tralian force in Egypt.
“Jeames” about a duke who needs the
money:—•
The cable mentions that Zimmerman, the Duke of
Manchester's Yankee father-in-law, has just died,
leaving the Duchess £2,000,000. The Manchesters
need the money badly. He is the only British duke
who has ever earned his living in the “picture” busi-
ness, and-one of the few who have worked. Dukes
loathe work. Manchester is also about the only non-
royal duke who has had no hand in the war. He has
been living near New York for years, following his
honest but humble calling. The U.S. newspapers have
been asking, somewhat peevishly, of late why he
doesn’t go away and fight. His invariable answers
are (1) that he doesn’t know how to fight, having
had no military training since he left the militia
years ago ; and (2) that he can’t afford to leave his
job. The passing of Zimmerman removes one ob-
stacle. Kitchener will probably be willing to deal
with the other. The first time I ever saw Ins Grace
was at Dinard, in the north of France. A local host-
ess gave a fancy-dress dance, and he transpired in a
bath-towel tout seal. 1 don’t know what he was
supposed to represent, but 1 know he was urged to
go away. *
THEY WHO COME AND HE WHO
WAITS FOR THE COMING.
Alex. Horniman, 8.A., whose death hap-
pened the other day in Sydney, was. a
barrister who put in most of his life clerking
in the District Court. He had a fine lot
of yarns of the early days. His father had
the Australian College in Surry Hills in the
’4o’s, and was associated with Dr. Lang
subsequently. Among his scholars were the
brothers John, Tom and .George Dibbs, who
years later presented their old teacher with
a gold watch on his birthday. The father
passed this on to the son, and it was among
the latter’s treasures when he died.
On the word of a friend of the family:—
The Kaiser can never turn pale. Even if lie
were tried for murder, and sentenced to something
lingering with boiling oil in it, he could not
change color. His bronzed appearance is
rubbed in like a floor stain by his valet.
It has been the fashion among Gerhog military
swankeys to ape the facial aspect of peastly
Britishers just returned from foreign service, whilst
swanking in the martial duds which no British
officers wear when off duty. Hence they have a
characteristic in common with rouged lydies of the
town—nobody can tell how sick they ought to be
looking.
Victoria now learns, a lot of it for the
first time, that Gisborne was one of the first
settlements south of the Murray. It was
named after a Sydney police magistrate —
one of the earliest —the third. He was son
of Thomas Gisborne, who was member of the
House of Commons for Carlow in the Parlia-
ment of 1837. The son was sent to Port
Phillip as Commissioner of Crown Lands. He
was fond of the turf, was one of those who
selected the Flemington racecourse, and was
on the committee at the first meeting held
there, and ran a horse. The early press, of
Australia has many proofs of his art with
the pen. He sailed for England in the first
’forties, but died and was buried at sea.
The father of the Kaiser’s unfortunate wife
visited Australia in ISSO. Accompanied by
a guardian, “Lieutenant Groenwald” arrived
in Melbourne in one of the Godeffroy’s ships
from Hamburg, having been swayed to some
extent in the selection of a travel route by
the fact that German emigration to Port
Phillip had commenced the year before. The
Prince of Schleswig-Holstein was then 19
years of age. William Westgarth, who men-
tions the incident in his “Personal Recol-
lections,” represented the Godeffroys in Mel-
bourne. He says that Captain Carr, the
Prince’s guardian, came to him one morning
in great distress. At a public meeting on
the day previous the Captain had made some
remarks, and The Argus had reported that
“Captain Stanley Carr told the meeting that
the King of Prussia had told him” so and so.
Carr complained that the expression should
have been that “an exalted personage in
Prussia had led him to understand” so and
so. The Prince and his mentor spent some
days at Westgarth’s residence, Maryfield, on
Merri Merri Creek.
Michael Adler, who has joined John
Bull’s Expeditionary Force, is the first
Jewish chaplain to be attached to a British
army. Privates Sheni, Ham and Japheth
reckoned they had earned a rabbi by reason
of their numerousness, there being over 5000
of the chosen people in pursuit of the un-
clean hog. If only 3200 had enlisted, the
Hebrew, in proportion to his. numbers,
would have equalled other races in his re-
sponse. so far as the United Kingdom is
concerned.
The dead Pope’s Apostolic Delegate has
been so long on the road to Australia that
a story had started round to the effect that,
the Australian bishops having protested, the
Pope had hung up the whole business.
Apparently the whole yarn tied on to
Bishop Phelan’s swift dart for Rome is
rubbish. Anyway, a “wireless” casually
dropped in at what used to be the Kyar-
dinal’s palace in Sydney the other evening
announcing that the Delegate, Cerretti, was
on the way from Rome via the United
States, and might be expected in for lunch
any day. His job in Australia is to act as
a sort of High Court, with the Vatican as a
Privy Council, to which he can allow appeals
if he likes, and needn’t if he doesn’t like.
F. C. Spurr, the Baptist parson who lately
left Collins-street for Regent’s Park, Lon-
don. is letting himself down lightly. In
Australia The Bul-
letin’s cry for
universal training
infuriated him ; now,
though he is “quite
impenitent,” he is
“in favor of institut-
ing some form of
universal drill or
physical cult ur e
which, compulsory
for every boy and
youth, will deliver
us from that phy-
sical unfitness of
which we have un-
fortunately too many
examples.” It’s a
great thing to have
learned theology
when you want to stand a hair on end and
split it.
A cairn has just been put up at Gisborne
(Vic.), to the memory of its pioneer, Henry
Ilowey. The date of his landing in Aus-
tralia is unknown, but he was in Sydnev in
1526, when he was married to the only
daughter of Capt. Minchin, of the 102nd
Regiment. This Minchin, who was a wit-
ness against Bligh, started as a land-owner
with 1000 acres near Parramatta. Ilowey
managed this estate, even then known as
Minchinbury. The doings of Batman and
the Port Phillip Association directed his at-
tention south, and in February, 1837. he
sent 4000 sheep and 800 cattle from X. S.
Wales in charge of one Hamilton. It was
reported that the party had been massacred,
but it got safely to Macedon in July. The
long familiar “Ilowey huts” were soon after-
wards erected at Gisborne Creek by Hamil-
ton. the real pioneer, though the boss, as
usual, nobbles the glory.
BRIBING THE MISSUS.
The health committee of the Sydney City Council
has recommended that a premium of £300 be
offered for the best method of disposing of city
refuse.
MARY ANN: “ There's the broom, Mum! If
you do me worrk I'll give yez a penny."
Thomas Joshua Dibdin, just dead at Cres-
wick (Vic.), was one of the pioneers of the
district that bred Premier Peacock’s cackle.
He had big interests in the Madame Berry
and other famous local companies, and also
founded a village named Dibdinville, where
he had over 200 miners’ cottages. But he
built upon sand, albeit there was gold in it,
wherefore Dibdinville crumbled long before
Dibdin.
Gregory Board, who died a couple of
months ago at Ashfield (N.S.W.), has ieft
20 pictures from his collection to the Art
Gallery and two to the Lewisham Hospital.
A Sydney native, this Gregory Board was
the son of another Gregory Board, who in
the "30’s kept the Blue Lion Inn in Ken’t-
street. During a long life the son cultivated
a judgment of real value in art matters, and
he had an income ample enough to allow
him to indulge his hobby.
THE ONE THING MISSING.
SETTE: “Yes, I've been most everywhere in
Australia. All through the Northern
Territory, across the Centre and back
again, down South, all the way West as
far as she goes, East too. Been in bush
fires, fought blackfellows, been ringer of
my shed, done a bit of pearl fishin', shot
buffaloes. In fact, seen EVERYTHING!”
BORED-TO-DEATH: “Have von ever had
delirium tremens?"
SKITE: “No-o-ooo!"
BORED-TO-DEATH: “Then you haven't seen
ANYTHING!”
George Cochrane —better known by his
pen name of “Grant Hervey’ —a huge, vain,
muscular man from Casterton, in Western
Victoria, was sentenced the other day by
a Sydney judge to a pair of years’ hard
labor. Hard labor isn’t likely to trouble
him much, for he has a constitution which
could shift pyramids and tear up the Sphinx
by the roots. In his earlier and better days,
Cochrane-Hervey was one of the best writers
of frivolous verse in Australia. He could
make a musical rhyme out of a tree or a
caterpillar or any old thing, and the tree
was always readable and the _ caterpillar
worth paying for. At the same time he was
an unballasted sort of person with a lament-
able tendency to fly away after new ideas.
A day came when somebody —probably Jen-
kins or Brown —persuaded him that he
should rush into politics and proceed to
regenerate Australia. He wrote a very long
letter to the editor of this paper announcing
his new mission. It read like the sort of
address which Bernadotte used to deliver to
the French army, yet there was in it a
convincing streak of sincerity. After that
the pleasant musical verse-writer became a
laborious pounder-out of patriotic screeds.
He stood for various constituencies without
success, and he got mixed up with politicians,
Labor leagues, Liberal leagues, wire-pullers
and all manner of sundries. His size and
his lack of ballast blighted his political
career. Besides, he never had a political
career. Finally he seems to have resorted
to devious ways of raising the wind. It is
a pity that the man who wrote “Blacksmith
Once” should be doing two years’ “hard,”
but when a person rushes into the fringe of
public life without the necessary equipment
anything may happen.
That reminds “The Oldest Inhabitant”:
Died on February 4, 1915, William Byrne Hurley,
manager of the Bank of N. S. Wales at Campbell-
town, of which he was a native. His father, John
Hurley, came to Australia as a lad and worked for Cap-
tain Murray, grandfather of the present Lieutenant-
Governor of Papua, at Lake George. In the first
’3o’s John settled at Campbelltown and kept a pub;
then he took up the country on which now stands
the important railway junction town of Cootamundra.
(His station property was named Cootamundry.)
John Hurley was in the third, fifth, seventh, eighth
and ninth Parliaments (1859-1880). There was
another and a iater John Hurley, but he was of, a
different “color.” The son was manager of the
Bank of N. S. Wales from 1880. The business was
conducted in the house in which he was born and
in which John Hurley had kept the pub. And that
recalls a story of Henry Stuart Russell’s. He
accepted an invitation to visit his friend, Captain
Allman, at Campbelltown. Said he: “Towards the
break o’ day I retired to my quarters, at the only
inn in the place, John Hurley’s. From beneath the
windows of the sleeping apartments, three in number,
in one of which was my bed, the shingled roof of
an outhouse sloped to within a few feet of the ground.
Unwilling to disturb the inmates at such an hour, I
crawled up this roof. As I gently pushed up the
window a terrible voice assailed me: “Stand, or I
fire!” I fell back, for the only object visible was
a white night-cap. I rushed to the next and thence
fled, repulsed by a female shriek. There had been no
travellers at the inn when I had left it; but in the
morning I got a message: “Sir Thomas Mitchell did
not know that it was you last night. W ill you come
down and breakfast with him?” Sir Thomas Mitchell?
I had last seen him in London !
BIRTHDAY GREETINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The President of the U.S., Mr. Woodrow Wilson,
sent congratulations to the Kaiser on his 56th birth-
day.
Greet we Royal William now,
Brand of Cain upon his brow !
Lo! his hands are bloody red,
Curse of nations on his head !
Homeless children sobbing sadly,
Childless mothers, wailing madly,
Lift his glory on the highways,
Tell his story in the byways ;
Tell of Belgian towns a-flame,
Havoc, deeds without a name ;
Fire and slaughter, death and pillage,
Blackened fields and ruined village ;
Gaul ensanguined, riven Poland,
Bloody Yser, flooded lowland —•
All the work of him, I trow,
With the brand upon his brow !
Fifty-six his royal years!
Oceans of salt, bitter tears,
Trenches thick with dead arraign him,
All the wounds of millions stain him.
Pity her, his hapless mother,
Her whose son hath Cain for brother ;
Her whose pangs and bitter labor
Only wrought a Human Sabre!
Pity all who live a-near him.
All the bleeding lands that fear him ;
And when pitying seems to pall
Pity him the most of all
Who by Fate and Fury driven
Fares insensate, rent and riven,
Till his haughty throne and crown fall
In the crash of Death and Downfall.
Yet e’en Pity turns away
From him on his natal day.

If you have tears prepare to shed them now.
The Sydney Ferries’ dividend has been
reduced to 7 p.c. “Owing to the heavy
falling-off in the revenue due to the war,’
the directors have reduced both it and the
steamer services. “When business becomes
normal again the Board hopes to revert to
the former dividend,” it adds. The rever-
sion to the former dividend is much more
important, you see, than the reversion to
the old time-table.
The co. still pays 7 p.c. Since it is
suffered to carry on a public service, should
it be permitted to pay any more? Of
course 7 p.c. is not a big dividend. But the
7 p.c. in this case is a fake. Of the present
capital of £46(5,666 only £220.066 has been
actually paid up by the shareholders. The
other £246,666 consists of profit capitalised.
Thus, on the money actually put up by
shareholders the present return is 144 p.c.
The investor in a co. certainly expects to
get more than 6 p.c.—more even than 7 p.c.
—as it goes along. He knows that in the
ordinary course it will make money which
it will not divide, and this money, being
invested in the business,_ will make more
money; and so the dividend will slowly
creep up to 7,8, 10, perhaps 15 p.c. That
was the old idea. Then a new one came
along. Why not, it was asked, capitalise
some of the'profits, so that the shareholders
might increase their dividend without
increasing the rate of dividend? In view
ot the fact that you don’t always want your
customer to know that you are making a
15 p.c. div. out of him, this seemed an excel-
lent scheme. Besides, it was good because,
if you felt that way, you could sell the extra
share-interest. But the Sydney Ferries and
some other mueh-too-greedy people want to
have things both ways. They want not
only to water the capital but also to increase
the rate of dividend. There is no reason or
justice in this, and the thing would not
have been tolerated if the recent Govern-
ments of N. S. Wales had not been so poor
as to fall almost beneath contempt. The
Governments being what they have been,
this and similar cos. have been encouraged
to believe that they have a right to eat
their cake and have it too. The result is
that investors have been induced to nay
ridiculous prices for these shares. The
time undoubtedly will come when they will
get a shock, for a Government will say to
them: “Increase, if you like, your dividends
on your original capital as undivided profits
are accumulated. But if you capitalise
your reserves, you mustn’t expect your rate
of dividends to ascend too.”
Assuming that public ownership is out
of the question for the present, the proper
thing is to apply to such services as this
the principles that Britain and other civilised
places have applied to gas. N. 8. Wales
did something of the sort recently. If the
co. has £500,000 of assets, whether pur-
chased with capital or undivided profit, it is
entitled to a fair return on the whole lot.
That is to say, it is entitled to make its
capital equal to its net assets, and then get
a fair dividend on the total. If the com-
munity controlled this public utility the
expected net return would not exceed as an
average 44 p.c. The N.S.W. trams reached
high-water mark in 1912, when they paid
£4 12s. Bd. p.c. Seeing, then, that of the
Sydney Ferries’ assets £182,756 is landed
property, which is to a great extent unpro-
ductive, 7 p.c. would be a fair maximum
return on that co.’s assets. This would he
50 p.c. more than the public would be
expected to provide if the State or muni-
cipalities owned the business; and 50 p.c.
is surely enough to pay for the blessings of
Private Enterprise. If the State is called
on to regulate the dividends, charges, etc.,
of gas cos., it is equally called on to regulate
ferry cos. ; and the investor who buys Sydney
Ferries on the assumption that the old.
cheerful watering and re-watering will be
continued to the end of things, will pre-
sently find he has been mistaken. The only
thing really in doubt is as to the maximum
rate of dividend that will be fixed. There
will no doubt be a struggle to make it
10 p.c. on old capital; but. in view of the
nature of the assets, it is very doubtful
whether it will be fixed beyond 8 p.c. even
if it reaches that amount.

-By successive waterings the capital hits been
made lip to £250,000; so the co. doesn’t con-
fess to anything better than a poor 40 p.c.
dividend last year. That it did so well as
that is almost miraculous, seeing that there
are few places outside France and Germany
which have been more disturbed by the war
than Broken Hill. Silverton itself, from which
the co. takes its name, has long been
quite dead; and the co. would have been
dead too, if Broken llill, 16 miles or so further
on, hadn’t been found to supplement the trivial
but rich surface deposits of which Silverton
was the drinking centre. Seeing, then, that
the co. took big risks and was saved only by
a fluke, Tiie Bulletin is prepared to admit
that it is entitled to something more than
a 5 p.c. dividend. But 2674 p.c. seems a
bit excessive. Some captious phople might
complain about even 214 p.c.
Naturally you would say that a co. which
pays a dividend of that size must be one of
the worst sharks in the world. As a matter
of fact, it is such a gentle shark that, you
don’t feel it biting you. You complain that
the freights must be excessive. It pro-
duces its books and shows you that for its
30-odd miles it really charges you less than
the S. Aus. Government would if it carried
the same goods for 30-odd miles. The secret
of the big figures lies in this: it makes up a
full train at one terminus and runs it right
through to the other. There is no running
half-empty trains, to possibly pick up pas-
sengers or freight 100 miles along the line;
no 10s. worth of shunting to drop or take
up ss. worth of freight en route. It charges
as for 30-odd miles, whereas that journey is
really an integral part of a 300-mile journey.
The S. Aus. Government might run the
freight the extra 30 miles for Is. The co.,
treating the stuff as though it were com-
mencing a new journey, charges perhaps
2s. 6d. Hence the majestic dividends.
The Broken Hill cos. are gradually finding
markets for their lead, but the prospects for
the zinc business are nearly as gloomy as they
were a week after the war started. Indeed,
there were hopes then that the smelting busi-
ness might be lifted bodily out of German
hands and put into English and Australian.
Apparently England has done nothing, and,
besides opening up negotiations with Jhe
United States, all that Australia has done
has been to add a few tons weekly to the
output of the B. H. Prop.’s baby works at
Port Pirie. If we must rely on Continental
works it may be years before Broken llill
finds a market again for its zinc concen-
trates. Meantime Broken Hill and this rail-
way co. will go short of that product which
during recent years has put the gilt on their
gingerbread. On the other hand, if the
tailings can’t be turned into money, they
won’t eat anything while they are waiting
for a market. The first column in the
table shows how greatly profits have in-
creased during the past few years, and that
boom has been largely due to the treatment
of accumulations of zinc tailings. The
accumulation now going on provides the
material for lengthening the boom when it
re-starts.
The co.’s liabilities are not worth men-
tioning —under £20,000. On the other side,
apart from fixed assets (line, rolling stock,
etc.), there are items, mostly liquid, totalling
£261,737. The capital is thus intact, exclu-
sive altogether of the value of the stock,
works and general undertaking. The only fly
in the ointment, apart from the uncer-
tainties inseparable from a mining field,
is the possibility of State competition. The
N.S.W. Government has at last started the
line to connect the present railway system
with Broken Hill. If a connecting link is
made with the S. Australian system—and it
seems certain that this link in a strategic
railway won’t be left in private hands —it
may be very awkward for this co. In any
case, some traffic will be diverted eastward.

The Vic. Government promises to pass a
Gas Bill through the new Parliament; but
this co. doesn’t seem scared. When a co. is
overburdened with profits and doesn’t want
to increase the rate of dividend, the handiest
plan is to issue more shares —free, if pos-
sible. but if not free at least at par. This
co., however, apparently doesn’t mind any-
one knowing that it pays a 13 p.c. dividend.
Hence when it wanted money lately, instead
of issuing 20,000 shares at par to bring in
£lOO,OOO, it sold only 10.000. but got a
premium of very nearly £ for £. The result,
of course, will be that, though the div. on
(he new shares will be nominally 13 p.c., in
reality the return on the new capital will
be only 0 2-3 p.c.
In fact, the 13 p.c. on old and new capi-
tal alike is misleading. The present share
capital is £907,210 and £513.745 has been
paid in premiums; hence the 13 p.c. is really
an 8i p.c. div. on the money actually put
into the business by shareholders. No doubt
when the new Gas Act arrives and limits
the rate of dividend, the co. will be allowed
to first capitalise its reserves. Then the
capital will consist of old share capital plus
premium capital plus additions to plant,
etc., made out of profits, after providing for
depreciation. In other words, presumably
the capital on which the co. will be entitled
to pay dividends will be the net value of its
assets. We have no idea what that will be.
The reserves shown in the table are not much
to go by, because hundreds of thousands of
pounds'of profit has been put into hidden
reserve, having been spent on new works.
Over £350,000 has been thus stuffed away in
the past, seven years. Now, some of this no
doubt is a set-off against depreciation. But
repairs and renewals are also charged direct
against revenue; so that the £50,000 or a
trifle more a year hasn’t to cover the whole
cost of replacement. As a matter of fact,
in the past 10 years the extensions charged
to capital have amounted to only £154,105
net; the total has gone up from £2,171,745
to £2,325,850. All the rest of the work
done in the past 10 years has been paid for
out of profits. And how extensive those net
additions have been may be more or less
judged by the fact that in that period the
receipts for gas consumed by meter have
gone from £138,091 to £290,493 —a half-
year’s figures in each case. If is just as
certain as anything can be that the co.’s
fair net profits at present are much in excess
of the 13 p.c, dividend. Under the N.S.W.
Act a co. (at the outset, at any rate) may
stuff away 2 p.c. of the capital outlay for
“general purposes.” The co. values its
assets at £2,325,850. Two p.c. of that =
£46,517. The year’s profit was £209.501.
Deducting the £46,517 there would thus,
under the new law in N. S. Wales, be
£162,984 to divide. This would allow of a
larger division than the co. now makes. It
is to be observed that the Act in N. S. Wales,
though it will no doubt prevent the cos. from
growing any more dangerous claws, had the
immediate effect of putting up the total
amount distributed. The ehances are that
the same thing will happen in Melbourne.
At any rate, there seems to be the money
there to do it with, though the whole pretty
scheme would be spoiled if Parliament made
a savage cut at the standard price of gas.

In 10 years the co. has shaken off the debt
which was incurred in 1904-5 in the recon-
struction of the theatre, and has put by
£3757. In the last five years it has paid the
24 p.c. div. and laid up £4854. besides spend-
ing a bit on re-decoration; and £4-54 is
equal to 2 p.c. p.a. However, it mustn’t be
reckoned that the co. is making 2 p.c. net
profit in addition to the dividend. For one
thing there is the return of capital to pro-
vide for, because the co.’s building is on a
lease which expires somewhere about the
middle of the century. Hitherto no proper
provision has been made for sinking fund.
But things should be better from this
onward. The J.C.W. people have a lease
that carries the co. on to 1928, and they pay
a higher rent for the last 10 years. Also
they are to pay for all repairs. There is
thus every reason to expect that, in addition
to providing the 24- p.c. dividend, lost time
will be made up in connection with the
sinking fund. Without being imprudent it
may even be possible to also give the share-
holders a trifle more to go on with.

In the first half of 1913 shareholders were
asked whether they would take a 334 p.c.
bonus in hard cash or in shares at par. As
the shares were then standing much above
par they naturally said they would take the
insult in that shape, lienee the increase of
capital from £45.000 to £OO,OOO. This was
managed without any reduction of visible
reserves. Up to that time the land at
Lithgow, freehold and leasehold, had been
written down to £20,584, and it was valued
low to start with. The co. wrote this asset
up, and in the next accounts it stood at
£40,504. That provided the extra assets to
stand against the extra capital. But appar-
ently the writing up was done very modestly ;
for now that £l5OO has been got for a piece
of the freehold, the co. treats the whole of
it as divisible profit, and pays out a bonus
of 124 p.c. in addition to the usual div. at
the rate of 10 p.c. p.a. Shareholders can’t
therefore complain of being starved lately.
Certainly there was a time when western
coal and poverty meant much the same
thing. At last, the owners formed the Lith-
gow Coal Association to handle their output
and stop the old undercutting: and on top
of that came the development _of Lithgow
as a manufacturing centre. Besides getting
indirect benefit from the manufactures the
co. two or three years ago decided to be in
that swim itself. Brickworks were the
result; and something over £12,500 has been
put into that business. For last year the
brick factory is credited in Profit and Loss
with £882; for the previous half-year with
£215. But whether interest is first charged
on the outlay isn’t plain. Doubtless it isn't
intended to be plain, In either case the
position is charming. This is how things

An absolutely “clean” balance-sheet at last!
Starting 254 years ago with £57,500 of
water in a capital of £60,000- —that is to
say, with only £2500 of tangible assets —the
co. has gradually put by surplus profits until
to-day the last of the goodwill has
been replaced by hard, solid wealth.
Before the payment of the present dividend
the co. owned £65,000, represented as fol-
lows :
Cash and deposits .. .. £20,352
Advances on properties. . . . 48,300
Book debts and oddments . . 7,998
£76,650
Less liabilities .. . . .. 11,447
Net assets . . . . . . . . £65,203
If the advances on properties are revenue-
producing, as presumably they are, the co.
should make more than half its dividend out
of interest earnings. This would leave only
£lO5O net to be earned from commissions in
a half-year; and things would have to be
bad indeed if the co. couldn’t do as much as
that. No doubt they are going to be pretty
bad. Some people tried hard for two or three
months to get the public to believe that
the Sydney land boom had merely taken a
breather after Willie had landed his punch :
but Sydney knew better. Still R. and W.
are not so much interested in the subdivi-
sion business. They go in rather for big-
property transactions; and though there will
he a slump in that line too, it won’t be so
bad a slump as in the business of selling
very desirable suburban allotments as far
away from Sydney as a well-trained crow
could fly in a couple of hours. In 1903,
which was a shockingly bad year in Sydney,
11. and W.’s profits reached £3801; and the
presept extra earnings from interest should
add £BOO to that, even if things get as bad
as thev were then.

The Profit and Loss account shows “extra-
ordinary exes.” somewhere about £2OOO for
the year. Most of this went in touching
up the machinery and buildings, which
"were found to be in urgent need of repairs
and renewals.” There ought to be a
Replacement Fund, of course, preferably
invested in liquid assets apart from the
business. The net effect of the discovery
aforementioned is that, the profits for the
past few years have been overstated, the
writings-off having been inadequate. In five
years, assuming that the plant, etc., have
now been made just as good as they were
in 1909. tlie business has earned the 74 P-u

so a shade under 15 p.c. in five years, or 3
p.c. p.a., has been earned for the ordinaries.
Very wisely this hasn’t been distributed ;
for in a business of this sort and of this size
£7OO a year isn’t too much to put aside for
contingencies. However, the thing really-
ought to do better. Originally too much
dependence was put on ice-skating. The
Glaciariuin had the usual short boom; then
it got down to mere bread-and-butter —and
the war scraped the butter off at the end
of last season. Seeing that the Glaciarium
could be nothing better than a side-line, the
directors tried to push the ice business ; but
there isn’t much profit in that in Melbourne.
There ought to be more in cold-storage ; and
additional facilities for welcoming the frozen
lamb and the frost-bitten cow are no doubt
responsible for the better showing made
last year. Mainly because the early calcu-
lations of the co. were all amiss its finances
have never been very healthy. At the end
of the year it owed £12,656 on a mortgage
and about £3OOO otherwise. Its assets con-
sist of a freehold, which cost it £7359;
plant, etc., which have eaten up £50,006,
but have been written down by £9600; and
£3548 of sundries.

Concerning another man who has had an
anniversary
A couple of weeks ago solicitor Barry, one of the
directors of the City Mutual Life Society, moved at
the Board meeting - that felicitations be extended to
Mr. Crowley on the 25th anniversary of his manage-
ment, and that his salary be raised by £750 a year.
Another director, Dr. Beattie, seconded ; and the
chairman of the co., the veteran Pat Hogan, fer-
vently said amen. Crowley thanked the Board,
declined the offer, and suggested that the staff should
have the £750. This recalls another occasion. A
disgruntled ex-employee accused Crowley and his
Board of corruption. The late Jack Want appeared
for Crowley. He produced a minute book showing
that the late John Hardie, a one-time city Mayor
and then a director, had moved a resolution, seconded
by “Toby” Barton, at that time another director,
increasing secretary’s Crowley’s salary by £l5O, and
showing, further, that Mr. Crowley had gratefully
declined on the ground that he was young and could
wait. The case had got to the High Court. Pidding--
ton was the counsel for the other side. One of the
“corrupt” acts —the main one, it appeared—was
that Crowley had allowed as the surrender value of
a friend’s policy £2O more than the sum set out in
the book of surrender values in use by the society.
Said Griffith, looking at Bidding-ton: “The inference
is that Crowley and his friend shared this £20?”
“Yes, your Honor.” “You heard the evidence given
in the Court below respecting this offer of the
Board to increase Crowley’s salary by £l5O per
annum, and you still wish the Court to believe that
Crowley corruptly allowed the extra £2O in order to
share it with his friend?” Piddington said they
were his instructions. “Well, all I can say,” said
Griffith, decisively, “is that it is an insult to any
mean intelligence to be asked to believe such a
thing.” And Crowley was vindicated.
Just before the war started a conference
was held in London to arrange matters in
connection with the mining and marketing
or diamonds. Present: L. Oppenheimer,
Gustav Imrotli, Stauch, Adolf Wagner,
Meyer Gerhard, Pasle, L. Breitmeyer, L.
Reyersbach, 11. Mosentlial, Carl Meyer,
Hirschorn, M. A. Viallate, P. Ross Frames,
J. C. Sheridan. All of them Briddish, of
course—except perhaps Frames and Sheri-
dan. And, in the natural and proper order
of things, those two are pushed down to the
bottom.
* * * *
Spelter, £3B 15s. It makes the mouth of
every Broken Ilill director water. But it
is no good to him. Except for a little made
by the B. LI. Prop, no spelter is produced
in Australia, and there are no facilities for
producing it. We have been content, in-
stead. to export our ore —the best available
in large quantities in the world—to Ger-
many, to build up that nation’s metallurgical
supremacy, and provide it with the means
whereby our sons are killed.
* * * *
The war had no sooner started than
general-manager Del-prat, of the B. 11. Prop.,
tore away to Europe to look for new markets
for the co.’s products. An agent was also
sent to the U.S. Finding he could do noth-
ing in Europe so far as “zincs” are con-
cerned, the American business was pushed
hard; and the soaring market for spelter
helped the negotiations, wifh the result that
bottoms have been secured for 45,000 tons
; —not much, but sufficient to justify the co.
in re-starting its flotation plant at Broken
Hill.
Elsmore (N.S.W.) is one of the Clark-
Mackay Melbourne group of Tingha tin-
sluicing cos. that had to shut down when
the war broke out. Since then a shaft
on the course of the deep lead where
tributors did their little best some time
ago represents work done. The fall
in the gutter is the excuse given for
the dirt not being payable, but another
shaft lower down ought to tell whether the
tin was washed on to a more level bottom.
Of the co.’s two dredges No. 1 started
early the year, but No. 2 continues to
rest. With tin on the soar again there is
no excuse for idleness when the new pad-
dock ahead will provide a continuous run
for 18 months to come.
The most important thing said at New
Buiragorang (N.S.W.) meeting was that
the vendors had agreed to accept 25 p.c.
instead of 50 p.c. of the profits set aside
for dividends. The liability is £l5OO, so
£6OOO will have to be available for division
before the debt is off the slate. The little
mine has produced 561 tons, valued at
£10,659, and more than half of that has come
from the high silver values. No one knows
if the rich ore met with between No. 5 and
No. 6 levels will continue at deeper levels ;
but it is most dangerous to expect uni-
formity in these rich streaks.
•* * > * *
Occidental (N.S.W.) sent 1197 tons of
Bdwt. stuff to the battery in 14 days. The
battery produced 17 tons of concentrates,
estimated to contain 140 oz. ; and 999 tons of
slimes, originally containing 3070 z„ were
cyanided for 2340 z. At 80s. per oz. that
amounts to £936, which added to the value
in concentrates makes a total return of
£1496. But costs are stiff, and the directors
don’t appear in any hurry to open deeper
levels, so the market is sick at about 3s.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) intends to
block out wash dirt again where the lead
has been developed and prepared for the
extraction of the wash. The purchase price
for Gordon’s property was £25.000, of which
£14,245 had been paid off to July, 1914. The
royalty is 25 p.c. of the tin value, so if no
other arrangement is made £40,000 worth of
tin will have to he raised to wipe off the
debt.

As a counterblast to “bear” statements
anent the Edna May, a mining engineer who
frankly likes the show sends the following:
The reef is in granite country. In fact, it
is surrounded by granite, except the bent
portion at the south-west end, which comes
in contact with the greenstone. The granite
bars, of which so much has been heard, are
of later origin than the reef, and in no way
affect the deposition of gold. Neither do
they physically affect the reef to any extent.
The only thing they have done so far is to
replace the reef at the point of their inter-
section with it, wherefore so much less ore is
available for breaking and treatment.
Further than this, the bars have not done
any damage, and are not likely to do any
in the future. These bars range from 3ft.
to 10ft. in thickness, have a south-easterly
dip, and appear to decrease in width with
depth, or, in other words, as they approach
the reef. Why granite should be taken so
seriously by some holders of the stock is
hard to understand, as several successful
gold mines have been associated with this
class of rock in Australia. As to permanency
in deeper ground, the prospects of the Edna
reef are distinctly good.
Fremantle Trading Co., which owns some
metal mines at Northampton (W.A.), and
does a bit of smelting for the public as a
side-line, has issued its report for the year
ended July 31, 1914. In view of the ad-
verse influence which the war has had on
the co.’s mining operations, no less than
£22,538 has been written off plant and de-
velopment, leaving £ll5 at credit of profit
and loss. Of the co.’s own ore 22,968 tons
were treated during the year for 2707 tons
metallic lead, 83« z. gold and 30460 z. silver,
the total value being £51,200. The co. is
now raising ore and getting advances on it
from the State.
Chaffers (W.A.) tells a tale of woe. The
officials, it appears, considerably under-
estimated the cost of the new plant, and two
disappointing returns coming on top of this
expensive blunder landed the co. in diffi-
culties. Some of the directors and their
friends then st'epped in, and, “to protect
the interests of shareholders,” advanced
£3650 to pay pressing liabilities and took
first mortgage debentures as security. Not-
withstanding this, Perth creditors are ask-
ing the Supreme Court to wind up the co.
and let them in ahead. How much of the
75,000 tons of 30s. sd. ore estimated to be
in sight 24 years ago really exists, and what
has become of the dozen and one rich shoots
of ore which were subsequently alleged to
have been uncovered are matters which are
bound to be inquired into shortly.
Star Exploration (W.A.) cl nuns to have
earned £lB6B during year ended September
30. Expenditure absorbed £1431. The
surplus (£436) and the balance brought in
(£79) has been written off plant and
machinery. Share interests held by the co.
are practically identical with those in the
safe 12 months ago. for although a number
of ventures were dangled before the Board
during the past year it did not bite at any
of them.
Oroya Links (W.A.) intimates to share-
holders in a belated circular that on the
outbreak of the war and consequent uncer-
tainty of getting supplies, it curtailed de-
velopment and devoted most of its energies
to stripping the 900 ft. level north and carry-
ing a leading stope at 750 ft. in the Eclipse
section of the property. As a result it
claims that the shoot at 900 ft. has been
proved for 100 ft. in length to average 325.
over a width of 16ft., and the values in the
750 ft. workings to extend much farther than
indicated in the drive and to be much above
the average grade of the mine. The treat-
ment of a larger percentage of sulpho-
telluride ore has interfered with the ex-
traction, and on the date of the circular-
about five weeks ago-—efforts were being
made to remedy this defect.
Another 3s. div. is announced by the
Edna May (W.A.). Stone worth 2oz. is
still reported, but yields don’t get up to
that average. Still they work out very
nicely, as 3030 tons last crushing gave
27110 z., and 2700 tons residues cyanided
gave bullion worth £2087. The whole of
the month’s output was valued at £12,931,
and the profit was £BBB6. Results were
thus better than for Dec., though not much.
The co. is now punching into the gneissie
schist to see if it keeps its place to the
next leveh

People interested in oil-well drilling in
South Aus. are asking why geologist Ward’s
report on the South-East is held back.
There is not a geological section of
the oil country in existence, and the
people who are drilling to discover what the
Government should have learned before
this are irritated to find that Mr. Ward.’s
name is spelled something like “oyster.”
Boring has been started by T. J.
Whaley’s Ocean Oil Co. at Kingston, and
by the South Aus. Oil Wells Co., eight miles
from Robe. Von Doussa, M.L.C., a director
of the latter, has been showing in Melbourne
a pure specimen of paraffin wax alleged to
have been found in situ in its proper matrix
inland from the sea, between Port Mac-
Donnell and Beachport. Australian Oil
Concessions has been underwritten in Syd-
ney, and the Standard Oil Wells Co. is being
formed to secure 640 acres next Whaley’s
bore at Kingston.
The Powlett North colliery is the only pri-
vate show that Ex-Minister Peter Mcßride
would allow at Wonthaggi when he started
the State Coal mine; but though he allowed
it to live The Bulletin cannot imagine
him forking out for it £5OOO as a State
grant. Yet that help is actually in the
wind. McLeod, M.L.A., says that what
weighed with the Minister was the number
of men that would be employed if the State
forked out the money. Ex-Minister Mcßride
would have rejoined that if the State cash
was to do so much the State had better take
the ground. But Peacock’s crowd isn’t built
that way.
* * * *
A' fresh tint suffuses Golden Pyke, since
if has been realised that the slump which
followed the boom hadn’t shaken all the ore
out of the old Pyke shoot of stone. There
never was 355., let alone 495., in sight in all
the mine actually proved or probable, and
the public got shot as usual. The grade of
the stone ought to have told the tale: but
a 7dwt. average was bolstered by the old
record of £93,000 dividends paid. The
present “highly remunerative” patch in the
mine is in the shallow stopes at 367fc. But
lOin. or Ift. won’t make big profits. As
those in the show usually slide out on a
firm market, the tip to quit is when the
buying fever is at its height. That may be
reached on a flutter over Chadwicks or some
little development in the deeper levels on
the Pyke reef.

John Simpson is doing cheaper work for
the Oaks than any other way-back Queens-
land field can swap lies about. For four
weeks to January 23 he put through 1040
tons for ss. lid. per ton —mining (including
fuel and stores), 2s. lOd. ; milling, 3s. Id.
As the 1040 tons gave only 1270 z., and as
Oaks gold isn’t worth more than 705., costs
have to be fine. Still there was close up
£l5O on the right side for the month.
* * * *
“Glassy Glance”: For the sake of the
whisky I have listened to a good deal of
skite by tin-dredge managers about the mil-
lions of yards of dirt they have sluiced
in so many hours, as if yardage was the
only essential. With very few exceptions
in my experience have they paid the least
attention to the much-more important factor,
vis., a process of concentration that will
ensure a maximum recovery of mineral con-
tents. Calculations based on the yardage
treated and the tin won are not an infallible
guide to the quality of the ground, nor the
capacity of the manager. With proper
facilities (and they exist on most dredging
propositions), and with an intelligent system
of sluicing, a pump can be worked with
much better results than ordinarily obtain.
To elaborate slightly, the process of con-
centration must begin almost from the
moment the jet strikes the face; and it is
safer not to rely too much on the saving
power of 100 ft. or so of iron sluices,
assisted by the ridiculously futile efforts of
a boxman. Another hoary superstition is
that the manager who procures a 75 p.c.
assay for his tin is the dizzy limit of mana-
gerial capacity. As a matter of fact, the
insane desire for perfection in this resp'ect
very often leads to the loss of a lot of good
60 to 70 p.c. ore, and not infrequently not a
little of the 75 p.c. ore also. This, by the
way, has been a godsend to the fossiekers.
who do not turn uo their noses at the
poorer-grade ore. Neither do the ore buyers.

The Philippine rake of dredges, in which
John McWliae and other Melbourne people
are interested, got on to poor stuff last
month, the yield from all the plants being
only 5380 z. against llTGoz. for December.
John didn’t blench, even when No. 4 showed,
that the bottom was as barren of wash as
a vulture’s neck is of feathers. Nearly all
the plants ran short time, but everything
is to improve from now on.
Walla roo and Moonta, which made a 20
p.c. cut in wages when the Madman knocked
the bottom out, now restores half of it. the
copper market having improved so much.

The Freeman and the Pratten interests
in Malaysia have been severed. 11. E.
Pratten originally went to the Malay States
for what is now Austral-Malay Tin. Ltd.,
and picked up two or three properties which
look good. A. W. Freeman was the mining-
man attached to the co. Lately it has been
made clear that the two interests would be
happier apart. Pratten and his friends
therefore sold their shares in Austral-
Malay ..to the others, and have retired also
from the Kampong Ivamunting Board, while
the two Freemans and Frank Leverrier,
Iv.C., have left the Larut Board. J. M.
Newman replaces A. W. Freeman as mining-
engineer on the Larut directorate, and will
make himself familiar with the co.’s problems
by an early inspection.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, February 8, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
The British pressman has reason to thank
his stars, for the new assistant censor, Sir
Edward Cook, is a journalist. He was a
correspondent during the South African
trouble years ago. Since then he lias com-
bined more serious literary efforts with the
usual Fieet-street grind, which included a
spell as editor of the Dairy News. He is
married to Emily, one of the numerous
Baird sisters, of whom the lanky Dorothea,
11. B. Irving’s wife, is one, and Mrs. B.
R. Wise another.
The Naval College at Jervis Bay is to be
officially opened this month to young gentle-
men in white ducks and saucy cadet coats.
Ex-Flag-Lieutenant Seton, who used to
shadow Admiral King-Hall, has left (tem-
porarily or otherwise) the training craft
Tingira, and is now at the Jervis Bay
school. The academy is approached via a
bog or bush moat (without the Grange that
Tennyson supplied to Mariana) in bad
weather. Still, the official ceremony is not
likely to be attended by any casualty except
to the marines.
Senator Pearce has hinted (not too soon)
that the wives, sisters, cousins, aunts and
sweethearts of Australian officers in Egypt
are not going to be accommodated with a
dress-circle seat at the Suez fray. In fact,
local Society, which has very crude ideas
under its chiffons, is fairly certain to be
coldly returned to its Exclusive Suburbs if
if gets within coo-ee of the sandy Egyptian
stadium. Side winds must have blown the
wide-awake Minister for Defence a hint of
a much-talked-of “Cairo season.” So a few
tons of feminine finery are about to be —
unpacked for home consumption.
An exodus to Tasmania is among the
social events of this flabby month. Aus-
tralia’s great lawyer, Samuel Griffith, is
cooling his learned brain in the jam-tin
ir.liuivi. So is our Chief Justice Cullen, who
usually camps half-way up Mount Welling-
ton during the long Christmas vacation.
Actors’ Day at the White City cooled off
under the influence of a southerly, and the
crowd went joyfully off to bump itself over
a scenic railway, or buy things from the
profesh. Frances Ross, in an airy-looking
garment of black lace and white shimmer,
cold flowers in the Allies’ stall. Next door
A theatrical gent, in a crushed-mulberry suit
bad a small side-show that was said to be
worth quite twice the entrance money.
Nellie Stewart, under the brim of a large
hat, also tied up posies and sold them at
fair market value. She had for company
Dorothy Brunton, who was herself tied up
in a floating gossamer. Manager Hugh
Ward strolled round, and George Titheradge,
president of the Actors’ Association, chap-
eroned Governor Strickland through the
mazy grounds. Beaumont Smith’s frolic-
some company gave one of the best side-
shows of the afternoon.
Fred Niblo beat a drum and addressed
the crowd in stirring language outside
another show pavilion. But there is such
wit in Niblo’s gags that the crowd enjoyed
about three hours of the comedian’s extem-
pore performance outside better than the
prospect of paying a shilling to go inside.
Jack Cannot, another strenuous toiler, must
be sore all over —particularly in his wind-
pipe—after his exertions.
Some Sydney folks who are supposed to
be partaking of rural life and bridge at
Bowral bobbed up. Mrs. George Earp, with
her young brood under her wing, sampled
various barn-storming events. Mrs. Spencer
Brunton and two daughters also stalked the
sights. Mrs. Prescott and a fair-haired Miss
Shaw, supported by a Polish eagle
outspread on Miss Csaykowska’s national
flag, sold anything they could lay their
hands on at the top of a flight of wooden
stairs.
There was a crisis in sugar in the tea-
room about 4 p.m., and those who habitually
took three lumps wore wintry smiles. The
two Brownlow girls, who were assisting,
tried to succor the sugarless in striped and
plain cotton frocks.
Actor Walter Bentley, who is the official
nib of the Actors’ Association, ambled peace-
fully round the innumerable foot tracks,
where the plain citizen’s brain hums like a
top, owing to the dizzy whirl of revolving
scenery. As an antidote it’s a fine thing to
watch the passionate desire of another sec-
tion of the public to fall down precipitous
canvas mountains in a long wooden slioof.
The recent route march of 2000 men in
khaki was a small affair compared with the
last big display of Australian tan. But the
men look very brown and fit, and I would
just as soon not be a Turk for the next
six months, if you really don't mind.
Eric Mugliston, son of the late Dr. Mug-
liston. barrister, joined the expeditionary
forces in England as a private. News
comes now that he has been promoted, to a
commission in the Royal Field Artillery.
11 is first training in arms was as a school
cadet in Sydney.
The local artists’ war contributions will
be chiefly in kind —pictures or art work in
some handy form, which the public will pay
for, incidentally, by subscription. Patriots
get something, if it’s only an impressionist
sketch of a back yard on washing day, for
their (‘ash, and the coin falls into the yawn-
ing war-bag. Artists Julian Ashton and
Lister Lister are pushing the scheme; and
hon. secretaries John Lane Mullins and
Oxnard Smith will receive your largest con-
tributions with their warmest welcome.
News of the engagement of another of
the nice Maddrell girls, of Braidwood,
trickles through from London. One of the
pretty sisters married young Downes, of
Brownlow Hill, a while ago. Now Coralie
is flashing an engagement ring, for which
soldier Kenneth Hinde, of the A.I.F. (I
haven’t the least idea which limb of the
British bulldog this indicates), is respon-
sible.
Governor Strickland and his Lady
Edeline are booked for a flying visit to
Kosciusko about February 17. They motor
first to Cooma. Thence they petrol up to
have a whiff of mountain air on the big
Monaro hilltop, and start for home a day
or two later. A limited number of the
vice-regal kindergarten will go aloft with
their parents.
11. Barnard, the man who talks Wedg-
wood china, is finishing his Australasian
tour with a run in Maoriland. He is travel-
ling right through that scenic country, and
is bound to give a discourse or two on the
particular brand of crockery he prefers on
his own dresser.
Outside the war zone the summer sale is
supplementing the heat wave as the most
stirring event of this month. Haunting the
bargain counter is a curious tradition: no
one has ever been able to state definitely why
Woman, at this time, insists on carrying
home all her parcels. Every tram is half-
filled with paper bags, and the übiquitous
suit-case also helps to keep one’s toes warm.
It is the season when women are filled with
a frenzied desire to purchase the things they
don’t want. The lure of llfd. must have
been invented by some imp below for the
destruction of domestic peace. Just now
the very vitals of feminine finance are
sapped by the fever to buy, and carry home,
something that costs 19 shillings and II
pennies and decimal 75 of another penny.
The local housewife is even beginning —
more power to her! —to make personally-
conducted tours among vegetables that are
sold at wholesale price. The result trickles
through the neat suit-case she bumps under
the tram seat in a fine nosegay of onions.
The three pictures recently added to the
National Gallery do not excite the average
spectator to wild enthusiasm, and the
trustees are not likely to be overwhelmed
with congratulations at giving house-room
to still another consignment of mediocre
stuff. Of the three, Shannon’s portrait of
a handsome pouting young woman is the
best. Campbell Taylor’s conventional pic-
ture. “Piquet,” represents the typical
British middle-class family having a very
dull evening at home. A portrait of 11. B.
Irving completes the trio. The subject is
depicted as a portly person with the general
appearance of a prosperous stockbroker.
The artist mercifully forebore painting
Irving as Hamlet —all knobs and acute
angles—and merely gives a frock-coat im-
pression of the gaunt frame.
Another wool man, W. Pitt Brown, of
Tasmania, recently of Durban, has offered
his services to the War Office. He has lat-
terly been looking after the S’African end of
the foolish business of exporting stud-sheep
from Tasmania. You’ve noticed, I sup-
pose, that there’s nobody in Australia to look
after the importation of ostriches from
S’Africa.
This week’s visitors included R. P. Vin-
cent, .an ex-Mayor of Perth, who has been
staying at the Australia with a sapling of a
son. When last glimpsed the pair were fly-
ing to the Mountains to look for a breeze.
Kenneth Stephen, a son of the late
barrister Cecil Stephen, was married the
other day to Dorothy Rennie, a member of
,the George Rennie family—descended from
that splendid old man who was for so long
Auditor-General of the State.
Hugh D. Mclntosh, of the Tivoli, supple-
menting the awards of the Royal Humane
Society, has struck a personal note of
appreciation for local bravery. Harold
Parle, who made an heroic effort to save
(lie life of his friend Tooze on January I.
was the object, and a gold medal the award.
The Tivoli stage was the scene of the little
ceremony, in which Frank Tudor, the visit-
ing Minister of Customs, played the decora-
tive part. It takes a special brand of courage
to swim out and literally drag a friend from
the snapping maw of a shark, as Parle did
in Little Sirius Cove, where he a'nd his
friend were bathing. Yet it is to such young
men who, for one reason and another,
haven’t gone to the war. that certain foolish
maidens propose to hand out white feathers!
Lena Bates, a Strathfield girl, got away
with the highest pass (S A’s) in the recent
Sydney intermediate public exam. This
distinction wasn’t earned by any boy, and
the Girls’ High School, of which Lena was
dux last year, is swelling with pride in con-
sequence.
A young colored potentate who rules in
East Africa is one of the most recent king-
lets to toss his goods into the European
melting-pot. Kabaka, of Buganda, was
taught by English tutors, and learned to
play golf and mingle soda-water with his
whisky in England. Now he asks to be
allowed to lead a native African regiment
against the common foe.
Mr. and Mrs. Freddy Shipman were at
latest at Chicago, the sty of the tinned hog.
The passing of Miss Braddon, the veteran
novelist, recalls the happy days of irrespon-
sible flapperhood. When “Lady Audley’s
Secret” was secretly gloated over in young
ladies’ boarding-schools the world was a
good deal younger, and the lurid imagination
of “Victoria Cross” and similar writers of
loud fiction were unknown quantities. Miss
Braddon, who was Mrs. Maxwell in private
life, was aunt to Mr. 11. Y. Braddon, general
manager of Dalgety’s in N. S. Wales. He
writes, too, but it is mostly on commercial
subjects for the benefit of the students in
economics at Sydney Uni.
Walter Massey Greene, who. represents
Richmond (N.S.W.) in the House of Reps.,
and can talk stock by the mile to his cow-
keeping constituents, was married in some
local splendor at St. James’s Church the
other evening. Miss Lulu Lomax, a
daughter of squatter Lomax, in the Tenter-
field district, was the bride.
In the slack season the Education Depart-
ment lightly turns to thoughts of omelettes.
Cookery demonstrations occur this week in
several big city State schools. Mothers
are urgently requested to step along, and
see innumerable digressions from the ever-
lasting frying-pan. Fathers ought to be
keenly interested in this show, for they put
away a good deal of cooked leather in the
course of a week. The high price of bullock
and the uppishness of the cutlet give an
extra value to these demonstrations, which
are aimed directly at butchers’ bills. The
Australian girl has yet to learn the uses of
macaroni and the French habit of making
soup out of the bone of a chicken and a
handful of herbs.
Dr. Russell Nolan, who lately went over
to the great majority at the age of 48, was
an Australian-born specialist of some emi-
nence. His “line” was the nose and throat.
An old Newington College boy, the son of a
Wesleyan parson, he married a daughter of
another Wesleyan parson, the conspicuous
Dr. Kelynack. In his profession he was
free of that commercial spirit which is
getting many of his specialist brethren so
cordiallv disliked. Yet he had a solid in-
stinct for values in landed property. A
good deal of the Poplar Grove estate at
Leura is or was in his keeping. He built
an ideal Australian bungalow with no
suburban frills or pepperpot towers in the
leafy glades thereabouts.
Though the Peace Society s.till holds
occasional meetings, and records blood-
thirsty resolutions against those who go to
war, it is trying to help, according to its
means. Naturally it looks for contributions
towards this object. But it doesn't circulate
its saucer with any great result. Up to
date, the Society’s Local Distress Fund has
only snared about £5O.
The Commonwealth Patriotic Association
is an infant society which pledges itself to
support British and Australian trade. Of
course it regards German goods as particu-
larly venomous; and any salesman who tries
the “made in Switzerland” dodge on the
members is liable to be spoken to in plain
figures. Some of the expert shoppers de-
clare that they would know goods made in
the enemy’s country with their eyes band-
aged. Perhaps. Still, wouldn’t it be better
to avoid the possibility of error by charging
so much on these goods at the Customs that
they couldn’t possibly come in?
The burly Scotchbyterian parson, John
Ferguson, has returned to his flock after a
few months’ holiday in troubled Britain. Big
John is the cleric who caused such a com-
motion amongst the more dour members of
the Scotch Assembly a few years ago. His
offence was an audience in Rome with Pope
Leo, and he stoutly told the theological hor-
nets that he’d do the same thing again if he
were lucky enough to get the chance. But
Leo has gone where even churchwardens
are at rest. Also, Europe being more or
less on its head, and armed to its teeth,
Parson Ferguson didn’t wait to leave his
card on Pope Benedict. He discourses on
war instead.„
The flounce which came back with such a
long prelude of discussion has scarcely made
its presence felt during the six months it
has been with us. It makes a mere slender
ghost of jts former outstanding fuss. And
the dreadful threats that the crinoline was
waiting round the corner have perished.
Paris is too busy to concern itself about
wire cages for ladies of leisure. Besides,
are there any leisurely ladies now? Even
duchesses are a-wing on the outer edge of
battle, to presently fly back and record their
emotions in print. ’Er Grace of Sutherland
has broken out already in a booklet called
“Six Weeks at the War.” —a title which
has a glorious ring of self-advertisement to
which poor human nature is prone. The
treasure hasn’t come this way, but: it must
be exhilarating reading—for those who have
not been nursed by the untrained duchesses
who haunt field hospitals.
A number of musical Australians now on
the other side lately cheered themselves up
by having their photos, taken together.
Donald Mcßeath, the young Sydney fiddler,
was among them ; also George Jennings, a
Melbourne tenor, whose beautiful moustache
has an Italian wave at the ends. This is
probably the result of recent residence in
Milan, where the Victorian was occupied in
acquiring polish.
A Maorilander named R. G. Blow has
been making a noise at the Royal Academy
in London. In 1018 he won the bronze
medal. Last year be took the silver medal
—the highest trophy the Academy pins on
the coat of aspiring youth. After three
years’ pursuit of harmony, the student has
gained his Licentiate. Young Blow, who is
a son of Maoriland’s Under-Secretary for
Public Works, left the Thames for his
native geysers on January 9.
The domestic problem appears to be _ a
fixture which even the greatest war in his-
tory cannot shift. In England the cry of the
Unemployed Woman seems to come from every
class except the domestic helper. She is as
comparatively hard to get in small house-
holds as she was 12 months ago. Also, she
is not taking kindly to the influx of foreign
refugees. News comes through private let-
ters of Mary Jane’s distinctly uppish con-
duct to those whom her employers welcome
as non-paying guests. Altogether, the
British matron is having a pretty rocky time
between the speeding of her male belongings
to the front and her efforts to smooth
Maria’s temper when it is ruffled by the
sound of foreign languages.
Harriet Newcomb, a former Sydney
school marm with a taste for politics (she
used to wave flags in suffragette proces-
sions), is finding a better outlet for her
restless energy. Amongst her war-time
occupations in London is some solid assist-
ance to the Babies Kit Society. This swarm
of busy bees has its hive in Sydney. Most
of the kits will go to London for Belgian in-
fants, and the almost-übiquitous Harriet is
waiting on the shore to hand them out. as
advised. Australian women are putting
into these tiny rags some of the very bes't
stitchery. When a careless soul falls short
of the standard, the hon. lady overseer looks
over the top of her spectacles for a patierit
Griselda who will unpick and re-make the
garment. Volunteers are always to be had
for this job. Still, it would be better for
Griselda’s temper, in this warm weather, if
ladies who make stitches as large as pot-
hooks would mercifully refrain from sewing
for defenceless Belgian orphans. Casli
would be handier, because it never has to b£
unpicked.
What freakish notions come to a head in
the way of societies for the propagation of
this and that. Sydney, for instance,
has a “Gold Brick Society.” The
members of this association, who have struck
the tremendously-novel idea of standing by
the Empire in the present trouble, will also
add to the temptations of the hard-worked
burglar. A small facsimile of a brick
glitters in gold on the watch chains of
the fraternity. Frequent patriotic out-
breaks will emanate from the wearers of
this badge—unless the rush of canvassers
for war subscriptions doesn’t hunt them to
an early grave.
Last week’s visitors at Medlow included
Dr. and Mrs. Macneill Simpson, Dr. and
Mrs. Gordon Marr, Dr. Roland Pope, and a
few more well-known professors of the
stethoscope, who are cooling down on the
Blue-hill top. Mrs. Fred Niblo is taking a
spell from the footlights at the same
breezy address. Enid Bennett fills the
place of clever Josephine Cohan Niblo, and
inserts an uncommonly pretty face into the
cast.
A threat to restore the boned neck-band
to the feminine dress comes from the other
side. But the Australian woman is scarcely
likely to put her throat into bondage for
some time to come. Certainly there -ireipe
summers when woman wore high, starched
collars and contrived to look pleasant in
the halter; nevertheless, one can’t regard
the dead-and-gone torment with anything
but a shudder.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

TO DEVELOP THE BUST.
A simple, safe and harmless way in which
any lady, no matter how thin or old, can in-
crease her bust development from two to five
inches in a few weeks is to take 20 grains of
phormoid, a standard concentrated food pro-
duct, just before each meal. For conveni-
ence. it is best to ask your chemist to supp’y
you with the standard phormoid tablets, which
contain 20 grains each. For a few shillings
you can get enough to last you two weeks,
during which time your bust should develop
from one to two inches. Many ladies report
five inches development in four weeks, and at
the same time marked improvement in the
general health. Phormoid is pleasant to the
taste.*

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, February 8, 1915.
IVIY Dear Yarrie, —
With the return of Dame Hennessy from
her seaside vacation, the Patriotic I and
work is starting to buzz again. There was
a wake-up meeting in the Town Hall me
other day, when suggestions were made for
dividing up the extra work into smaller
parcels. Representatives of every suburb
and the near country towns will meet at
regular intervals and report what has been
dene. The idea apparently is to lift some
of the burden off the devoted few and har-
ness up the general public. The general
public is a willing enough horse when har-
nessed ; but when it sees the devoted few T
dragging the cart themselves, it just looks
over the fence at them.
The G.-G. couple have arranged to lend
Government House grounds to the Victorian
Poultry and Kennel Association for show
purposes early next month, so that all the
proceeds can go to expand her Ex.’s Red
Gross Fund. It is a horribly noisy way of
raising money for a good cause; but nowa-
days money is so scarce that if .money could
be raised by also raising Cain, the first
murderer wouldn’t have another quiet
moment.
The vice-regal Stanleys are fascinated
with Macedon and the lodge that sits
thereon. They are planning to entertain
there instead of coming down to town for
a garden party which they are simply bound
to give this month. The journey to Mace-
don will go a long way towards keeping the
company “select” and the food bill down.
The Hennessy dame is taking* an interest
in sericulture, and lately called a preliminary
meeting of friendly souls and arranged for
a deputation to the Minister of Agriculture
about the matter. Families in many parts
of the country could no doubt indulge in
silk culture as a side-line. The work
connected with the business only occu-
pies six weeks in the year, and could be
undertaken by the weaker members of a
hard-working family. The worms are never
angry when robbed —they don’t even turn
and look threateningly at the robber.
European silk culture is likely to have a
set-back,, and impressive figures are quoted
regarding the value of the industry to
France and Italy. Thus we make haste to
profit by other people’s misfortunes. Or
are we just being self-reliant? One gets so
confused these times!
Some rich Maorilanders are preparing to
send a. hospital to the war with Mrs. Bone-
fue in charge. This lady has already a
claim on the gratitude of Maorilanders for
good work done among Maori girls in the
North Island. Her son left a Maoriland
college to go to the war, and she has a dozen
other close relatives on the long and dread-
ful job.
Highbrows had a characteristic night-out
on Saturday, when naughty little modern
classics, translated from the German, were
played by semi-amateur, semi-professional
actor-folk at that haunt of dare-devils, the
Austral Salon. There were three plays,
“The Affairs of Anatol.” Advertisements,
programmes and all other proclamations
carefully suppressed the name of the author,
Schnitzler, presumably because of his un-
popular nationality, and gave all the credit
to translator Granville Barker. Schnitzler
is the Austrian who is famous for his snappy,
crisp little plays. The Repertory gave
Melbourne one big, strong production of
his “The Mate.”
The translator of “The Affairs of Ana-
tol” has cut out much of the friskiness of
the originals; but there is quite enough
left to interest. Nicholas Joy, who played
Anatol, is a local product who wears lovely
black hair and looks bored. Sometimes he
looks so bored that I doubt whether even
the placing of the world at his feet would
rouse him. It might be possible to stir him
by throwing the Crown Jewels at his hair —
but 1 don’t think so. J. 11. Cunninghame was
his second, and his women were Maud
Jolliffe (she first wore grease-paint at
the old Repertory Theatre) and Nellie
Bramley, a youngster with naturally curly
black hair who has toured in bellowdrama
for Rill Anderson. The orchestra con-
sisted of Ethel McKay and a piano.
The naughtiest of the plays was "The
Wedding Morn.” Anatol had been toasted
much in champagne at his future father-in-
law’s house the night before. The snow
encountered on his way home drives him
into an opera-dance. There he finds an old
flame with mask and dazzling eyes, and
wakes up on his wedding morning to find
the embarrassing young lady in his bache-
lor diggings. The puzzle of how to get rid of
her without disclosing the wedding-event
approaching made the audience sit up and
laugh. “The Episode” was a playlet in
which Anatol bur.vs his Past at the quarters
of a bachelor friend. “The Faro\ye 11 Supper,”
with Maud Jolliffe i_ pale green and pearls,
is an effort by Anatol to artistically finish
an affaire.
Gregan McMahon sat at the hack with
Marshall L.vle and said that he had “no
idea an Australian audience would stand it.
or he would have given the stuff long ago.
ago.
Beryl Reid, well remembered in Mel-
bourne as a pretty girl who made charming
sketches of children, suffered a distressful
time when the war broke out. She was liv-
ing in Nuremburg with her husband, and
had GO pictures on exhibition there. Hubby,
burdened with the name of W ilhelm von
Goldstein, is the son of a German natural-
ised in England and living there. Hence,
he was promptly arrested and hauled off to
prison, with about TOO French and English
residents. The German police are sus-
picious just where the British are most con-
liding. In Britain, or here, the English-
named son of an English father who gets
naturalised in Germany, is supposed to be
beyond suspicion. Well, Beryl s good man
was grabbed so suddenly and secretly that
she lost the run of him for some days. Then
the influence of German friends restored
him to her. but only on the condition that
the couide left Germany at once. So the von
Goldsteins made a hasty and tedious jour-
ney to Zurich, leaving their pictures, house-
hold goods, and Beryl’s collection of pet
animals behind them. Zurich proved to be
almost as German as Nuremburg. so they
moved to Lugano, where the artist’s mother,
coming from England, joined them. There
is still a small English community at Lu-
gano, and Beryl, ma and Von have a flat in
what used to be the Golf House. The young
artist has made something of a name for
herself in London since her marriage. She
was in demand for illustrating kiddie stories,
and did pictures for “The Jungle Books
published by Nelson’s.
The twin daughters of It. Kelly Maitland,
the V.A.T.C. liandicapper, faced the starter
for the Matrimonial Stakes at St. John’s,
East Malvern, the other night. Mirth, the
elder, gave herself into the keeping of a
Sydney man, Percy Raymond-Raymond;
while Sylvia married a hyphen too —Eric
Russell-flibbs. Both brides went gloveless
and long-sleeved to the altar, and wore pink
trains with their white bridal dresses. The
church was decorated in pink and white, and
so also was the Malvern Town Hall, where
champagne and oratory were dispensed.
Margery and Nancy Withers, daughters of
the late artist Walter Withers, are making
ready to carry on studio work in their
father’s place. They will set up their easels
at Robb’s Buildings, in Collins street, where
Withers’s pictures have lately been exhibited.
Margery has won her National Gallery Cer-
tificate. She passed in every section and
gained second place in the Scholarship com-
petition. Nancy. the younger girl, is
specialising in designing and commercial
work. In a few weeks this busy pair will
start their struggle.
The Withers girls had an exciting experi-
ence during a recent country holiday. They
had rented a cottage at Malmsbury. and one
evening they went out to a fancy-dress
party. A frantic neighbor suddenly burst
in and stopped the revelry with a rude yell
of “Fire!” Then the news was broken to
the Withers that it was their fire. The
rented cottage and everything in it was de-
stroyed, and the unhappy young people were
left with nothing but the very inadequate
fancy dresses in which they had been cavort-
ing. They had to return sadly to town in
borrowed garments. As for the cottage-
owner. I presume his tears were dried by a
fire insurance co.
St. Kilda is quite demented on the subject
of statues. The Foreshores Committee
recently planted Captain Cook on the
reclaimed beach, and there lie stands and
gazes at the sea. Now they want to set up
the late adventurous Flinders in stone, and
are imploring Gaud Mayor Ilennessy to give
them the chiselled mass. Allen, a com-
mitteeman possessed of antlike activity, has
offered a site and promised that an enthu-
siastic private citizen of St. Kilda will pro-
vide a pedestal. The Gaud Mayor, suitably
top-halted, is now prowling round the lawns
attended by a breathlessly eager committee.
Wouldn’t it be terrible if, after asking him
for a stone, he gave them bread?
Miss Audrey, daughter of the George
Chirnsides. gave up her sporting dogs when she
went off reluctantly for her “finishing” tour
with mother. Oscar Asche bought “Captain
"Wood.” the star greyhound of the kennel, and
the death of this elongated anti hurried ani-
mal (reported by cable) has probably thrown
the Chirnside girl into half-mourning. How-
ever, she has bought some more lean dogs
and is “doing” the coursing season in Eng-
land. I have no doubt that Audrey the
sport was secretly ; delighted when the out-
break of war put something of a stop on the
tiresome “finishing” process which. I under-
stand, entails much dressing up, manicuring
and small talk. I cannot be sure, because I
myself was never finished. Only the meek
and rich are finished. In an official sense
the rebellious rich girl and the poor literary
bud have to remain raw products to the end
of their days.
This is where I become mysterious. The
divorce who married a divorcee has brought
her back from their European jaunt, and in
her foreign clothes she is the smartest thing
iu sight. The pair have settled down quietly
in a seaside suburb with a definite and neatly-
timed arrangement about the two sets of
children. A motor is sent to convey one
pair of offspring to visit their father on liis
days, and another car fetches the other pair
of infants to see their mother on her days.
The consignments never meet nor mingle,
and the complex machinery of life works as
smoothly as can be expected on a mixed
diet of forbearance and petrol.
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
Douglas Mawson’s projected lecturing tour of
England and the Continent has been knocked on
the head, of course. He has substituted a season
in the United States, and has arranged for two
months’ travelling, with two lectures a day—
Sundays and all.
Dr. Bickle’s elder son, Neil, has secured a com-
mission on the Amphion ; and Gordon, a, son of
the- late A. W. Sandford, who joined King Edward’s
Horse in the beginning of the war, has been given
a commission in the Field Artillery.
The South Aus. division of Wattle Day League,
having decided to buy a motor ambulance, held a
meeting in the Public Library lecture hall on Wed-
nesday, to discuss ways and means. Mrs. ..Jeanne
Young, who has been the champion of Effective
Voting since the death of Miss Spence, has under-
taken to devise schemes, and the ball will be set
rolling with a fete at the Jubilee Oval on Feb-
ruary 27. The star speaker at the meeting was
.1. 11. Svmon, whose wife was one of the League’s
founders.
Miss Helen Murray and her sister are back from
England, and are again at Rhine Park.
On Foundation Day a blast from the bottomless
pit raged all day and all night. Holiday-making
slumped, partly because the hills are so burnt that
picnicking makes no appeal ; still, a good crowd
ventured to the A.R.C. Races at Victoria Park—
among them the Governor and Mr. Mulholland, most
of the racing men, and a few of the keenest
racing women. The totalisator took in £6OOO
less than at the same meeting last year. The
best thing was £ll 16s. paid by Miss Neckersgat,
in the last race.
Clara Serena (Kleinsehmidt), the South Aus.
singer who came back from Europe at the end of
the year, is spending a few days witlr Melba at
Lilydale. Madame heard her sing when she was in
Adelaide for her Red Cross concert, and was
sufficiently impressed to ask her to Lilydale there
and then.
The new premises for the Missions to Seamen, to
replace those which were burnt last year, were
opened at Port Adelaide on Wednesday by the
Governor, with Dean Young as one of the speakers,
and the Bishop in the chair. There is a debt of
£l6OO to be cleared, but the Mission has an ener-
getic committee, so the money will be raked in.
Dr. Helen Mayo left on Thursday for a trip to
Tasmania, in which peaceful spot she’ll presumably
forget germs and temperatures for a while.
From England comes news of the engagement of
Hilda, the younger of the Frank Fisher daughters,
to Lieutenant E. Britten Jones, of the Royal Army
Medical Corps. He is the second son of the Britten
Joneses of North Adelaide.
Lady Galway has received news of the death of
her eldest brother, Sir Arthur Blennerhassetfc, at
Nagpur, India. He was in the Political Depart-
ment of the India Civil Service, and was Assistant
Commissioner of the Central Provinces of India.
Miss Thomson, the new secretary of the Y.W.C.A.,
arrived by the Egypt on Saturday. The institution
has been thriving under the guidance of Miss Ander-
son, who combined good works with an attractive
personality arid sound business habits.
Peter Whitington, formerly Commissioner of
Audit, lias bad his seventieth birthday. He is a
son of the late William Smallpiece Whitington, who
came to the State in 1840 in his own ship, the
New Holland, and was one of the first to introduce
pedigree stock into S.A. Hobart's archdeacon is
another son.
Gordon Ayers, grandson of Henry Ayers, the old-
time South Aus. Premier, has met a tragic finish,
being somehow lost overboard during the night, on
the Egypt’s voyage, between Melbourne and Sydney.
He was not so well known as his brother Julian,
but he put in some good work as engineer of
“overhead” lines during the first years of the
electric trams in Adelaide. He was 40.
A unique banquet was given the other
evening by GO priests to the Very Ilev.
O’Connell, of Carlton, after his return from
having a word with the Pope. The cathedral
hall was the scene, and the sandwiches and
soda-water were sent in by Berges, of the
Savoy. The whole brilliant affair was
engineered by the Rev. Guy Gavan Duffy,
son of the High Court Judge. Dean
Ilegarty presided, and the guests included
bishops and deans and principals and good
fellows who could sing a song and tell a
story. Dean Carey was a sort of star; he
recited'an original complimentary ode, and
put in a capital song; and there were
others by Fathers O’Sullivan and Moynihan.
And Father Tom. of the Coll.veen Balm,
was to the fore, with the Rivirind Dolan of
the Shockrawn.
If the lovesick Nanki Poo meant to
reflect on the softgoods business when he
described himself in mournful song as a
thing of shreds and patches, his Chinese
sarcasm was quite harmless. Only the seller
of shreds and patches can afford to give his
wife a whole mansion for a flat, by way of
freeing her completely from housekeeping
worries. This great and good act has just
been performed by warehouseman Felstead,
who went forth like a true knight with his
cheque-book in rest and hired the skilled
services of the lady who steers an adjoining
flattery. Now if Mrs. Felstead will only
hire another warehouseman to look after
her husband’s business affairs the account
will be square.
Somebody says that one of our bachelor
tennis champions is to marry a charming
second-leading lady on the boards hereabout.
But I wouldn’t breathe it for worlds, Rumor

dear Yarrie, by not saying anything about it.
The exposures that are due in The Case
have already cost one man his nice, snug

“Jimmie”. Lawson, of these parts, has an
Irish-Australian brother who has been
raised from the rank of Major-General to
that of Lieutenant-General, and now is a
sort of elbow to the Kitchener autocrat him-
self. The soldiering Lawson married the
widow of an English earl a year or two ago.
and was given the job of Governor of the
Channel Islands —which specks in the sea
are blessed by having no excise duty on
drink. The result is that champagne and
that sort of bubbling nectar can be bought
for tenpence or something a gallon, and a
square bottle of gin costs about the same.
But in these days of soda fountains what
use is all that information to you?
The J. A. Davidsons, who have plenty
of browsing space round their Oakleigh
castle, gave a real Australian party last
week. That is to say, they paid due defer-
ence to the summer climate of the land we
live in. The chief item was an outdoor pan-
tomime, with a grass terrace as stage. Mrs.
Davidson received her guests on a side lawn,
and passed them on to the seats of the out-
door theatre, where, later, Australian ama-
teurs played an Australian pantomime
written by some modest unknown. Hostess
Mrs. Davidson played the part of an Eng-
lish duchess, while her husband did his best
as the regulation Dame. (But let us draw
a tarpaulin over that part of the entertain-
ment!) Daughter Joan, who was also in-
volved, had enlisted some girls with pretty
Irish names, one of whom, Eileen O’Connor,
was the Witch. Mr. Percy Henry (hon.
stage manager) was a Green Demon of the
Bush, and made himself popular by singing
“Sister Susv’s Sewing” etceteras. Miss
Ivy Wil son held the orchestra down with
one hand. The performance began at eight,
and supper was a mere glorious memory at
10, so you will see nobody lost any beauty
sleep, especially as those present were far
too rich to go home slowly in decayed trams
and things. One small thunderstorm tried
to mar the proceedings ; but someone of the
first importance looked threateningly at the
sky and put an end to it. The clothes were
so' beautiful that the dialogue was prac-
tically painless, and everybody forgave Mr.
Davidson.
Mrs. Fred Fairbairn and dark-eyed
daughter Jess are expected back in April,
after their dash to England to see the sol-
dier son off to the front. Jess is said to
be very like Auntie Jess Fairbairn, a belle
of the early ’Bo's, who married an English-
man named Lumsden, and migrated to Eng-
land. since which the ex-beauty has been
widowed and remarried. (Is this matter
for the Historical Society?) She has
(Auntie still) developed into an ardent
disciple of Mrs. Eddy, and is now piling up
the dollars as a Christian Science healer.
That, I think, brings her up to date.
Gerald Fitzgerald, who, some years back,
wedded the dressy MacMeikan widow, has
gone to Egypt with the boys of the young
brigades. The grass widow is consoling
her loneliness with the baby granddaughter
that the Rex Fla tea us left in her charge last
year.
Miss Braddon, who wrote “Lady Audley’s
Secret” and then 65 other novels, died in
the middle of last week in London. Her
husband • was the late John Maxwell, the
publisher, and her talent for sensational
story-telling she passed on to their son,
W. B. Maxwell, the novelist and war-
correspondent. Miss “Braddon’s” brother
“Ned” was formerly Premier of Tasmania,
and afterwards a member of the first
Federal Parliament. He was a born
comedian, quite wasted in dull old politics.
When he was in the Assembly in Tasmania
he supplied the Hobart press-boys with the
only little entertainments some of them ever
had. But that was in the retiring rooms.
In the Chamber he was always the pink of
propriety.
Marie Hall, foremost of local dollar prin-
cesses. returned from England by the last
I‘. and O. boat without her appendix. And
the company didn’t knock even an anna off
the fare.
A young man who is to marry one of
the Williamson panto, chorus girls has made
a terrible discovery —telegrams, even those
marked “Urgent,” are not delivered to the
ballet or chorus until the end of the show.
These missives share the fate of all the
billets-doux that are sent round to the stage
door. A girl’s grandmother may be dying, or
her fiance perishing of loneliness in a. cafe,
but she won’t be any the wiser until the
sacred show is over.
Disconsolate flappers who positively must
frivol are falling back upon morning bathing
parties at St. Ivilda. A young Englishman
who was asked to one of these little shows
described it as “most immodest.” He had
probably been used to Margate, where most
of the costumes are formally passed by a
council of wowsers before being donned. To
the British " mind that has been nurtured in
Margate or Blackpool, Australia is an abso-
lute devil of a place.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

A PRECEDENT.
C OCKY: “After the milkin' every night yer
work'll be to do the separatin', and then
feed these pigs and calves.”
NEWCHUM : “ Well , the other fellow didn't
attempt to separate them this morning.
He fed them all together.”
“Paddy Melon” : Who says an emu can’t
be broken in as a beast of burden? Let him go forth
and obtain knowledge. I saw a bagman. arrive at
the Speewa, himself on foot, but his swag and dilly
bags neatly packed on an emu. The feathered
horse’s halter consisted of a piece of green hide
attached to a stick that protruded from the nose
(the bagman must have been used to camels). Any-
way, the emu led well, and at night its coxswain
hobbled it out on a patch of prickly pear. The night
I was in his company he discoursed at length on the
many useful things an emu was suitable for. He
got it to sing “Come into the garden, Maud”; but
it was a rotten vocalist, I thought.
“The Reefer’ 1 : In the Sandwich Isles
when extra-large eels are caught (some are 30in. in
girth) the natives transfer them to shallow rock
holes some distance inland. Each “boy” has an Wei
pool of his own. In course of time a nigger's eels
learn to come at their boss’s summons. A missionary
told me he had watched them feeding out of a
young chief’s hand with perfect confidence. He was
a bishop, too.
“Outcast”: The Papuan is rather a boast-
ful person. For instance, he keeps a string tally
of all his adventures with the ladies, and when
under the influence of too much joy drink he delights
in telling over his exploits to boon companions.
IV hen a man dies and is laid out, the string tally
of his reprehensible relations with married women
and unmarried girls is suspended from a croton
plant placed at his head or feet. The bigger the
tally the greater the honor. One Papuan I know
has a list of his lady loves scarred off on his shoulder
muscle, but he was careful to explain to me that
this was only the list of his amours in his own
village, and did not record his casual adventures
throughout the territory. For that, there wasn’t
enough space available.
“R.B.II.”: In the interests of natural
history I want to shed some light upon the propa-
gative possibilities of the snake. A couple of days
ago a friend of mine at Osborne Park (W.A.) had
an encounter with a specimen of the tiger brand.
A post-mortem revealed the presence in the corpse
of 23 partially-developed reptiles, from five to six
inches long, a circumstance which plainly shows that
snakes are subject to the ordinary process of gesta-
tion, despite the common fallacy prevailing that the
young are hatched from eggs. The specimen has
been identified by the Director of the Museum at
Perth as of the notechis scutatus variety, which is
considered the most venomous in Australia. The
female may produce as many as 50 in a single
litter.
* * * *
Paddy Melon”: On the claypan and
sandy country of the Lower Diamantina and Cooper
livers there is a weed which plays aged Henry with
horses that happen to eat it. It. is the eyes that
suffer. At times mobs of horses are rendered tem-
porarily stone-blind. A thick scum covers the eye,
and, unless attended to promptly, a horse is liable
to lose the sight. Powdered sugar and salt, alum,
powdered bluestone and vinegar have all been suc-
cessfully used to clear the scum, but in some cases
nothing will restore the vision. 1 have seen
drovers with large mobs of cattle stuck up for a
week and more on account of blind horseST. One
unfoi innate cowpuncher last year, going down the
Cooper with 1200 fats, was stuck on one camp for
17 days. During that period he used all the sugar,
salt and vinegar in the camp. Then, to cap the
lot, as soon as he had fixed his horses up and was
ready to move on, all his men left, because sugar
was off. I don’t know how he got on after that;
vvhen I passed him he was cursing the dear old
Cooper with uncovered head and a holv light in hif
eye.
“Paddy Melon”: A‘ c “A.V.L.” (B
S/12/-14) and “Sarto” (11. li/l/’U) on the friendly
nature of the fantail and the blue-wren. I agree with
the former that the fantail wins the stakes. Last
year, while overlanding a mob of rams, a fantail
accompanied us the whole way—and the whole way
was as far out as Winton. It was the day after I
took delivery that I noticed the bird having a ride
on one of the leaders’ backs, and from that out I
saw the visitor every day till I delivered. It used
to fly from back to back and got as fat as butter
before the trip finished. At night it used to go to
its nap on the calico break, and, after being a week
on the road it used to come every morning into the
fly under which I camped and give me the office it
was time to get out.
lln * * *
ilie Ifiinu ’: Is there any reason why
Australians shouldn’t have local agricultural notes,
instead of goods imported from the Chewing Gum
country? Ever since the N.S.W. Agricultural De-
partment announced, with a whirl of trumpets, that
it would publish, every week, results of experiments,
note S a n C comments calculated to help the farmer and
settler, I have watched the effort with interest. Before
me lies a copy of the notes for January 9. There are
five articles, and three of them start off like this:
An interesting experiment was conducted at
Nebraska Experiment Station, U.S.A., during last
winter.” Now, what in the name of the Great
Snake is the use of such stuff? We never have a
vvinter in this State to correspond to Nebraskan con-
ditions ; and, even if we did, local experiments are
much more interesting. Also, they are much more
useful. Perhaps the Department never thought of
that.
* * * *
B.N. . Above all things else a Papuan
pig prefers sweet potatoes. The natives protect
their vegetable patches with regular stockades, and
still the wild swine bunt their way in. The Sere°-em
villagers, ’way up in the main range, to prevent their
domesticated pigs pushing through into the gardens,
cut a hole an inch in diameter in the ears of each
pig. A 3ft. length of strong wood is put through
these holes, and secured. The squeals and grunts of
the animals when this stick is all that stands be-
tween them and a spud patch is enough to cause the
inventor of file scheme to squirm in his mausoleum.
One night a few jears ago the missionary at Ivevori
thought lie heard pigs at his garden ; so lie grabbed
ns gun and sneaked along through the reeds outside
his fence. Presently the long back of his quarry
moved in the dimness beyond, and the excited pastor
gave it both barrels. The target, instead of squeal-
ing, set up a blood-curdling screaming. It was a
native girl who had been on her hands and knees
catching swamp-crabs when the hail of lead over-
took her. That little lot cost the parson more than
a sleepless night.
A BLOOMER.
REV. MEEKUS : "And are you coming to our mothers’ meeting?”
THE MISSIS TOMTITS (with mild reproof): "Not being MOTHERS, Mr. Meekus we”
REV. MEEKUS: “Oh—eh—exactly. That is—don’t mention it” (Exit hastily ,
tripping over his own feet.)
Talk about lonelv deaths Outback ! Reid
Park, Mosman, the shadowy, tree-lined ravine
whereto the speechless evening lovers of Sydney go
with arms wound carefully round each other’s waists,
has provided the tattered remnants of an unknown
woman who died or was murdered, and whose body
lay undiscovered for the best part of a year, within
a stone s-throw of dozens of red-tiled suburban houses.
Lord only knows how many love-murmurs the un-
known overheard as she lay out in the dark wait-
ing' for her overdue coffin, but she must have listened
to more than is good for any woman.
* * *
“Suds”: What shearer or bushwhacker
was it said the city bloque can’t drink ? I produce
Exhibit A. He was a witness in a suburban court
case last week, and under examination admitted he
was no bigoted teetotaller. On Christmas Day, ht-
said, he did not begin drinking, beyond a pipe opener
or two, till 11.30 a.m. Then he had two beers and
a drop of gin. At 12 o'clock he had a couple of
glasses of wine, and between then and 12.30 two
more beers. He took a bottle away with him for
lunch. At two o’clock he visited a friend, and had a
couple of tastes and a bottle of wine. During the
afternoon he visited another friend’s, where a “jimrny-
john” of beer was broached. Subsequently he was
the victim of insulting language in a public place,
being perfectly sober at the time. '
“Lagani-Namo”: Male natives belonging
to secret societies in the Banks group wear certain
croton leaves in a particular way as lodge emblems.
Though any native may wear croton foliage, it is
strictly taboo for the uninitiated to wear the leaves
in the way any of the societies have made their own.
Some of the lodges cultivate croton plants around
their club houses; and to preclude outsiders from
decorating themselves with the select variety the
plants are grafted so as to produce a singular kind.
To do this two. different slips of equal size are taken,
an inch of the bark is stripped from one and a like
depth of the pith is removed from the other, so
that the former can be inserted into the latter and
the barks meet exactly. Some of the most experi-
enced native horticulturists succeed in producing an
identical variety, year after year, by this grafting
process.
“Dux”: Henare had returned to the fold
and was making testimony. “Py corry ” he said
to the multitude, “te time I reft te Tarawation
Army I te werry sorry for myself. Now I come
back I te preased as”—— What else he said
remains unknown. The captain hit the drum a
wallop and started that appropriate hvmn, “Oh
save me in my stress.”
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
Finally, Mr. Hughes was asked about the Federal
capital....“And when do you expect that the
federal Parliament will be meeting there?” Mr.
Hughes looked up in a startled fashion. Such a
possibility did not seem to have occurred to him.
He steadied himself and said: “Not in our time, O
Lord!” —News item.
BRIGHT CHEILD: “ Papa, WHAT is Can-
berra?”
EMINENT M.P.: “ Canberra , my child? Can-
berra is where naughty politicians go
when they are dead."
Senryb : I found the deadly monotony
of “Please shut the gate” broken between Barraba
and Bundarra (N.S.W.). This way:
When the last trumpet calls he won’t be late
Who stops to shut the cocky’s gate.
I shut that gate.
(Continued on page 2J/.)
A SORT OF APOLOGY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If ever you tell the tales of us,”
Said Mulga Mick to me,
“Be just a nacheral sorter cuss,
An’ don’t you cart- a D
For the artist an' ’is sillybus,
You adjectived old B.
“Let others string their beads o’ rhyme;
There’s this for you to do:
To tell the tales of many a time
That each of us went through ;
An’ he yourseIf—YOURSELF, or I’m
Done once for all with you !
“Those nights at Piker’s pub, fcegod !
What rorty nights were those!
The pinchgut tracks we often trod,
Bare-heeled an’ out at toes —■
An’ yet you'd make the bluebells nod
Round those things, I suppose!
“The scarlet girls that Piker kept
Behind the Sunset bar
(I grant you now that once one wept
For her young Lochinvar,
What time you didn’t know, but slept
An’ dreamed of faces far).
“You thought them hard —an’ so they were,
Yet more than once I saw
A tragic teardrop glisten there
That filled my heart with awe
(The paradox of sweetness rare,
An’ fang, an’ tooth, an’ claw!).
“An’ once you thought Her wondrous kind,
’Twas then for me to show
llow blind you were, how dense an’ blind,
How fast—an’ yet how slow!
It pained me grievously to find
How much you didn’t know!
“We saw the camel teams, an’ we
Twain pictured Old Romance,
The spice an’ myrrh of Arabv,
The Desert daughters’ dance ;
But that was rot, it seems to me—
A damfool circumstance!
“But there the blood of life ran red,
Beyond all hint of doubt,
And there was Mirth to Madness wed
For you to write about ;
So now, old mate, you go ahead—
But cut the tinsel out!”
So if my lines are apt to miss
The good bull’s-eye of Fame ;
If some are blue with emphasis,
And more are red with shame,
You might, perhaps, remember this:
That Mulga Mica’s to blame!

‘‘Bill Bowyang” : I’m going into the patent
medicine business. I kr.ow several persons who have
been thoroughly cured of rheumatism by sleeping on
beds made entirely of bluegum leaves taken from
young plants, and stripped from the branches near-
est to the ground. It is, moreover, well known
among bushmen that a brew made from a dozen of
these leaves is good for inflamed eyes.

THE "SANDERSON” IS
UNEQUALLED; AS A
FIELD CAMERA IT
STANDS ALONE.
m
'^k
The “Sanderson” Hand Camera is the most useful and
valuable Camera for all-round work that it is possible to obtain.
The “Sanderson” is at once simple in construction, easy to
manipulate, and combines the manifest advantages of a Field
Camera with the portability and “instantly ready” character
of a Hand Camera. It is without doubt the ideal instrument
for a skilled worker.
The Universal Swing Front, a movement that has made
the “Sanderson” famous, is entirely governed by a single pair
of locking nuts. All the actions are controlled from the back,
and the lens swings on its axis, travelling upwards, forwards
or backwards on a pair of struts slotted in their full length.
These movements, however, are held in reserve, and need only
be brought into action when required.
Amongst the many improvements that have been added to
the “Sanderson” Camera recently are the New Back Focussing
Rack for wide-angle work, Rack and Pinion control to the
Rising Front, Improved Method of attaching the Reversing
Back.

Highly Concentrated
Flavoring
Essences.
THERE are one or two points concern-
ing Essences which, if observed and
acted upon, will help tremendously in build-
ing up a bigger and better business.
The Soda Fountain business to-day is a
science requiring skill and experience, ever
offering new opportunities and scope for
development. It is necessary, therefore, t/i
be keenly alive —to study all points of the
business, and strive to improve in both
quality and appearance the drinks you serve.

H We would urge upon you the wisdom of using only the best
Flavoring Essences. Beware of cheap and fraudulent goods.
More damage can lie done to your business than you may think.
KDo not confound quality with strength. The essential qualities
of flavoring essences are delicate fruitiness of flavor, rich aroma
and solubility. Too great concentration impairs these qualities
and injures the bright, clear, sparkling appearance of the
beverage.
II Buy only the Best. The difference in cost between the good and
poor is so slight that it pays to use only the best.
Nelson’s highly-concentrated Flavoring Essences are in every sense the most satisfactory and
economical on the market. They contain in a highly concentrated form all that rich, luscious
fruitiness so essential to the making of high-class drinks.
That our Flavoring Essences deserve your urgent attention is obvious from the fact that
so many have made good on them. That they are meritorious and satisfactory in the highest
degree—thousands all over Australia using them will testify.
Make it your business to look into this' matter right away, don't lose any time. Write
to us on the subject. We shall be glad to give you, free of charge, the benefit of our experience,
which may be of some assistance.

“The Pariah” : Colac (Vic.) is at present
chiefly interested in goat raising. Some months ago
the Railway Commissioners announced their inten-
tion to spend £37,400 on improvements to the
Colac station. Some of the local Poohbahs bucked
into the matter and wrote explaining that the plans
were unsuitable, etc. After being informed that
their objections have been over-ruled by the engi-
neer, they forwarded a deputation to the Depart-
ment to instruct the engineer in his job. That did
it. After an interval the Department wrote saying
that, as desired, the intended work for Colac had
been modified, and it would now cost only £2OOO.
But about the goat race. On January 1 the three-
guinea . event was won by Sweet William, with
Boronia and Sweet Nell in that order, and Odorless
and Eau-de-Cologne fighting it out for fourth place.
“L.N.”: Everywhere around the South Sea
Islands the conch shell is used as a trumpet. A shell,
say, 20in. long and about 9in. in 'the biggest part, is
chosen, and a hole three-quarters of an inch in
diameter is made about three inches from its apex.
The trumpeter holds the shell in both hands, takes
a deep breath, and blows into the made hole. Over
water, the reverberating note can be heard a mile
and a half away. Instead of putting their lips to
the hole the Sandwich Islanders cement a three-foot
bamboo pipe to it, with gum from the breadfruit
tree. This enables them to prolong and control the
sound better.

FIRST DRUMMER : “Did you have a succesful trip?"

“Uloola” : Some calculating fiend estimated
that in a few years’ time it will be possible to take
from the Burrinmck dam 11,000 tons of fish annu-
ally. This should solve the pro-
blem of the supply of fresh fish for
N.S.W. country towns. That is,
if the stock isn’t all dragged to
Sydney for the benefit of the
bloated metropolis. Judging by
the quantity of fish caught with
hand-lines during the past year,
the estimate is rather under than
over the probable yearly haul. A
few months ago it was almost im-
possible to dip a bucket of water
anywhere along the shores of the
lake without taking up small cod
and perch. The water was liter-
ally alive with fry. About 80ft.
above the original river-bed the
wall is pierced by two tunnels.
Each of these is open a foot or
so, and through them have come
trout up to 71b. weight, cod, perch
and “yellowbellies,” as much as
121 b. in weight. One morning
. over a hundred pounds’ weight of
fish was picked up. One energetic
fisher is already on the job—the
destructive shag. Before the
water was stored, only odd couples
of these voracious birds were to
be seen along the still reaches of
the ’Bidgee. Now they are in
hundreds, and last breeding sea-
son most of the old gum trees
left standing on the flats over
which the water spreads were
dotted with nests, every suitable
branch having from one to half a
dozen on it. Recently the Irriga-
tion Commission organised gun
parties and obliterated the enemy
in hundreds.
“Outcast”: I have frequently tried to
explain to our Papuan brother that when a wise
white man takes a wife he expects to receive some
payment with her if possible. This procedure seems
to be looked on with approval by the young bucks,
but respectable fathers of families with several
daughters to dispose of shake their heads. A daugh-
ter to them is a highly profitable piece of property,
and, as a general rule, a man has to pay his parents-
in-law pretty heavily for the privilege of marrying
into the family. Among the Kiwais of the Fly
River a wife is valued at a canoe or a dugong spear
or an armshell. About the year 1850 a wife could
be bought in the Torres Strait Islands for a knife
or a glass bottle, but prices have gone up in recent
years. In fact, the cost of wedding is becoming
outrageous. Old Maino, the well-known chief of Yam
Island, paid for his missus one camphor-wood box,
seven bolts of calico, one dozen shirts, one dozen
singlets, one fish spear, one pound of tobacco and two
pearlshells. Subsequently he considered she was
altogether too dear. In these mercenary days values
have risen so rapidly that a man often pays for his
wife on the instalment plan. The Government
blocked this on the Fly River, and fixed the price of
wives at £4 sterling, spot cash.
WHEN SHAKSPEARE CAME TO BILLABONG.

To Murrumbidgee’s Billabong
The Strolling Hogans came.
A pupil wild and lean and long
They tried upon the same.
The patrons came from far that day,
And Shakspeare's ‘‘Hamlet” was the play.
The pupil’s name was Ernest Green,
A fearful bungler he ;
He roared right through the ghcstly scene —
The people yelled with glee.
But soon they wearied of the sport,
And threw tomatoes of a sort.
Then every time that Err.est came
On thin and quaking legs,
They harried him with little shame,
Aud hurled their scer.tcd eggs.
The Hogans egged him on in vain,
The patrons egged him off again.
Then Ernest struck. He scooped the voile
From out his dexter eye.

He threw his garments by.

The Shyness of Tim Canty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘fnilE shy, coy lad was Tim Canty,”
said Flynn reflectively. “A bit iv
a bye six fut in his socks, ’n’ wid
freckles to him ye’d be hangin’ a hat on, ’n’
sthrong too, cud take a thriflin’ horse on
his back ’n’ walk him off shtraight.
“Whin Tim come t’ Corcorain’s, Mary
Dwyer was turned aightee-i ’n’ a saucy fine
gir-rl livin’ wid her da ’tween the two cricks,
him ownin’ ez nate a far-rm ez yill meet wid
anny place, ’n’ a dairy herd ’twould comfort
yer soul t’ see.
“Tim Canty come frim the other end iv
Bungaree way, havin’ hot Ilooley’s land
intint on shtartin’ fer himself, wid his
father’s blessin’, ’n’ rare knowledge iv cows
’n’ crops. Tim was twinty-five, no more, ’n’
a distant an’ reluctant gallant wid the weemin.
would occupy a fortified position wan mile
off, ’n’ trow am’rous glances in the fir-rm
conviction he was the devil iv a felly, ’n’
makin’ great headway wid the sext, mark
you. ’Twas his delibrit intintion t’ marry
’n’ settle. Didn’t he tell me wid his own
lips?
“ ‘There’s a nate, tall wife a man’ll be
nadin’, Flynn,’ sez he. ‘D’yeh mind anny
such at all? Wid a gift iv milkin’ ’n’ a
disposition fer domestic juties?’ he sez. ‘l’ll
not be har-rd,’ sez he, ‘can she bake well,
’n’ wash, ’n’ hoe an acre iv shpuds wanst in
a way, ’r stand up a chain iv good fencin’.
I'll nade wan sound iv health,’ sez he, ‘stout
’n’ actiff, will be no dthrag to a man makin’
his fortehin. Is she pretty beside ’twill
be no dthrawback at all.’
“I cudn’t bethink me iv a lady would meet
thim requirements, but give him me promise
t’ kape a sharp look out. Manewhile, how-
ever, Tim cast his eye on Mary Dwyer frim
a rispictable distance, ’n’ shtarted a delibrit
’n’ judicious courtship frim the hill behint
his bar-rn, lookin’ at her a dale troo a micro-
scope give him be his great aunt Martha.
’Tis a shy man will make love to a
nate gir-rl troo a microscope, but I’m tellin’
yeh Tim Canty was wan afflict wid a painful
reserve in his dalin’s wid the weemin. Did
Mary come nigh him be the width iv a
paddock, Misther Tim brack into a cowld
shweat, ’n’ shied off a mile. But wid his
glass in a tree, ’n’ him well covered be the
boughs, ye’d find him a disprit characther,
gazin afther the gir-rl long V ar-rdent wid
an insolent eye ’n’ ez stout a hear-rt ez the
great Don June himself.
“Manny’s the time I come on Tim in the
rocks iv the hill over agin his cow paddock
crouched wid his distended microscope fixed
on to Mary Dwyer, watchin’ the gir-rl com-
m V goin’ about her juties. ‘ ’Tis a dacent,
ortherley woman, Flynn,’ sez he, ‘ ’n’ yill
not be seein’ a thrimmer figure in the width
iv Asia,’ sez he.
“ ‘Thrue,’ sez I, ‘but what progress would
yeh make wid a lovely gir-rl, rnakin’ eves at
her troo a glass, ’n’ you a mile off ’n’ aightv
yar-rds?’
“‘A man would be careful,’ sez Canty,
‘bein’ wan wid property ’n’ jewdicious be
nature ’n’ sthrict trainin’. Would yeh have
me rush the gir-rl,’ sez, he, ‘ ’n’ marry her
off-hand this avenin,’ sez he, ‘ ’n’ me un-
acquaint wid the habits iv her ’n’ her tin-
dincies ’n’ dishposition?’ he sez.
“ ‘Yer a moighty rushin’, tearin’ ’n’ dish-
turbin’ foorce, Timmy,’ sez I, ‘ ’n’ ’tis wise
’n’ well yill restrain yer proclivities, but
maybe wan day yill be seein’ a rare, illigant
weddin’ troo yer glass, John Hogan havin’
a passionit regar-rd for Mary, ’n’ though
John is bald ’n’ forty, long-distance love
makin’ wid an opery glass is not his idea iv
am’rous tactics ’n’ shtrategics.’
“ ‘That ould, good-fer-nothin’, limpin’
villain!’ sez Tim wid shpirit. ‘Lave him
cross me path once only ’n’ I’ll put a flamin’
sorrer on him will stay wid him the year.
Y’ll hint t’ Mary Dwyer, will yeh, Flynn,
I’m givin’ her case jue consideration? But
be careful, man, ’n’ tie me t’ nothin’. I’ll
not be tied till me mind is satisfied entirely.
’N’ wrong ye are, Flynn, in yer hear-rt
thinkin’ I’m shy, V diffident, ’n’ fearful
iv gir-rls. Don’t the glass bring Mary
Dwyer dost t’ me I cud touch her, ’n’ me
hand not shakin’ a jot, ’n’ never a blush t’
me cheek at all. ’Tis a brave man surely
will be able t’ say that, Flynn.’
“This sort iv progriss was continued a
mather iv a year ’n’ a ha’f, Tim circulatin’
in a rayjis iv siv’ral hundthred yar-rds, wid
his microscope will stretch two fut ’r more,
’n’ trowin’ a figure wanst in a way did Mary
look towar-rds him, then scuttlin’ fer the
rocks like a shtartled rabbit.
“ ’Twas meself tuck the news to him.
‘She’s t’ be wed, man ’ sez I. ‘ ’n’ well ’n’ good
yer served wid yer coortship be a system iv
signals.’ sez I, ‘ ’n’ yer love srlances wid a
mis’rable microscope. John Hogan is wan
holdin’ faith in d’rect communications, ’n’
the weddin’s no more’n a week away this
day.’
“He looks at me quiet ’n’ still. ‘ls that
so?’ he sez. ‘Then yill have me think I’ve
waste me time these long days? Tut-tut-
tut!’ sez he, ‘weemin is fickle ’n’ conthrary,’
he sez, ’n’ a tear would weigh wan ounce
flops to the cheek of him. bounces to his
chin, ’n’ falls on his boot, V at that I lave
the poor boy to his sorrer.
“The weddin’ day came shweet ’n’ shinin’,
wid the glory iv shoring flowers, ’n’ the
twitter iv bir-rds along the road t’ Ryan’s
Town, ’n’ Mary ’n’ her da is jauntin’ t’ the
church in the new trap, her in her weddin’
dhress, shweet as a pink saint in a picture
be the store. ’Tis at the fut iv Pete’s Hill
Tim Canty slips from the saplin’s. ’n’
snatches Dwyer’s horse be the head.
‘Where’ll ye be jauntin’ to in yer best, Morris
Dwyer?’ sez he.
“ ‘Lave me horse, Canty, will yeh,’ Dwyer
he sez, ‘fer we’re away t’ Ryan’s Town t’
the weddin’ iv me Mary, ’n’ no time fer
compliments,’ sez he.
“ <Yer goin’ t’ no weddin’ et Ryan’s Town
this dav, Morris Dwyer,’ sez Tim.
“ ‘ ’N’ fet why not?’ sez Dwyer.
“ ‘Haven’t I this mornin’ set fire t’ the
church?” sez Tim.
“ ‘Then the curse is on yeh, ’n’ yill go t’
gaol, ’n’ Misther John Hogan will find
annother place t’ marry in will do well
enough,’ sez Dwyer.
“ ’N’ all the time Mary Dwyer was sittin’
still ’n’ pale, savin’ nothin’, but lookin’ at
Tim Canty wid big eyes.
“ ‘Yill not be marryin’ wid ould, bald-
headed, limnin’ Hogan in church or anny-
this day.’ sez Tim.
“ ‘We’ll not?’ cries Dwyer.
“‘You’ll not; ’n’ why? Becauze I’m afthei
havin’ took John Hogan be foorce, ’n’ put
him where he’ll keep fer wan day.’
“Then Mary Dwyer shooke at last, ’n’
her vice was clear ’n’ high : ‘ ’N’ for why
have yeh done these things, Tim Canty?’
sez she.
“ ‘Becauze,’ sez he, ‘yill marry wid me,
Mary Dwyer, or with no man.’
“ ‘Then I’ll marry wid you, Tim Canty.’
sez she. ‘ ’n’ it’s a sore long while I’ve been
brinsin’ yeh t’ the point,’ she sez.
“The church was but a thrifle scorched,
’n’ John Hogan was locked secure in Canty’s
underground cellar small bit the worse fer
it, ’n’ injueements was made t’ save Tim
from gaol- him bein’ abroad to his honey-
moon be this. So ut all ended happily ’n’
wid satisfaction, people aereein’ generally
Tim Cantv done pretty well fer wan exces-
sively shy.”

What do you find best to keep you in good health ?
SOME DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE RELATE THEIR EXPERIENCE.
“ T HAVE given Sanatogen a fair
1 trial. My experience confirms
the medical opinion there is no
longer that feeling of fatigue which
one previously experienced, but
there follows from its use a distinct-
restorative effect.”
“ O ANATOGEN seems to me a very
O valuable food and nerve tonic,
I have several times taken a course
of it when I have been run down,
and always with good results.”

» TV /lY experience has been that, as
IV A a tonic nerve food, Sanat-
ogen has on more than one occasion
done me good.”
I FIND Sanatogen an excellent
tonic.”
“ T HAVE been taking Sanatogen,
1 and think that it has decidedly-
helped me to get through the ex-
tremely arduous work that I have
had to do during the past few
months.”
SANATOGEN has done every-
thing for me which it is said
to be able to do for cases of nervous
weakness and exhaustion. I began
to take it after nearly four years’
enforced idleness from extreme
ill-health, and now (after only four
months) I find myself able to enjoy
both work and play again.
“ QIR FREDERICK MILNER was
much run down from over-
work when he took Sanatogen, and
it certainly did good. He has more
than once sent supplies to poor
people, run down from illness or
overwork, and it has invariably
proved successful. It seems both to
nourish and give strength.”

“ T HAVE for two months been
A suffering from a rather severe
attack of Congestion of the Lungs.
I am now recovering and rapidly
regaining strength, which I attribute
in a great measure to my having
taken Sanatogen twice daily for
some weeks.”

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Remah”: “Vic” (B. 24/12/’l4), writing
of the turning out of the first loco, from
Thompson and Co.’s foundry, Castlemaine,
says the codlin moth in the apple of the
industry is the fact that only 22 out of 125
apprentices will improve themselves by a
course of technical-school training, although
the firm gives every facility and offers large
inducements. I offer the suggestion that
perhaps one of the best inducements would
be the reasonable certainty of employment
when the term of apprenticeship having
ended, the finished workman marries and
settles down in the town which Thompson
and Co.’s enterprise has undoubtedly done
much to build up. ' I don’t know wbat it
may be at Castlemaine, but I do know how
it is at other places where similar facilities
are offered. The fact that single men are
often retained in slack times, while married
ones are put off, is easily explained by the
fact that the latter, being anchored by fam-
ily ties, is likely to remain in the district
and so be at hand when again wanted, while
the single workman, when slack times
occur, is liable to board the train and
light out for parts unknown. The system
may be all right for the employers, but it is
hard lines for the married workman and
for the one who wants to be married.
“Chloe”: The altitudinous price of fruit
in Sydney is an outrage on a too-complaisant
public. Huge quantities of fairly good fruit
are wasting in the gardens around Parra-
matta, simply because it does not pay the
grower to pick and pack any except the
very best. A great quantity of _ slightly
inferior quality just wastes, when it would
be a blessing to many a poor householder,
who finds it impossible to buy at current
rates. Adelaide has far more economical
and better methods of fruit distribution,
and prices there are no more than half
of Sydney’s, though the fruit is of as good,
if not better, quality. The South Aus.
Growers’ Association brings its produce to
co-operative, open markets —fine buildings
covering from four to five acres, perfectly
equipped. There are no agents ; each grower
drives his motor-lorry into the market place,
and sells his stuff to any _ buyer in either
retail or wholesale quantities. The city
and suburbs are served daily by cart or
barrow, and a daily supply of fresh and
excellent garden and orchard produce is
assured. There is not a single Chinese
grower or vendor. The trade is entirely in
European hands, largely German, and is a
very prosperous one.
* * ,* *
“Milo”: North Coast Co-op. Co., Byron
Bay (N.S.W.), put up a record in Decem-
ber. For the five weeks covered by the
December pay, the quantity of butter manu-
factured was only a few hundredweight short
of 1000 tons, and the money distributed
among the co.’s 2000 suppliers was £119,800.
For the whole year Strawberry and Daisy
yielded 10,034,3131 b. of butter. The co.
also succeeded in stopping the squeal of
37,040 pigs. The total distributed among
suppliers of cream and pig was £911,703;
and yet the co. produces less than half the
butter made on the Richmond and Tweed.
Since the North Coast Co. started in June,
1895. the turnover has been £7,755.402. The
family of Daisy and Strawberry has truly
given the Big Scrub a rousing leg-up.
* * * *
“Pick”: I tumble out of my dinghy to
contradict “Bloggs,” who describes the work-
ing fisherman (B. 14/1/T5) as languid,
beery, mercenary and insanitary. “Bloggs”
plainly has never stood waist deep in the icy
sea hauling for hours at the end of a three-
thousand yard drag-net, with the very likely
chance, when he finally heaves it ashore, of
finding nothing but two tons of jelly, fish in
it. I have, and, therefore, I know that a
fisher’s weariness comes not from chronic
lassitude as “Bloggs” flippantly alleges, but
from the back-wracking, bone-chilling night-
time yakker that in record time makes young
men old rheumatic wrecks. It is, further, no
part of the wholesale fisherman’s trade to
clean the fish he yards up. The bargain-
hunting beater-down of prices will find the
Pacific just as adjacent and available for
cleansing purposes as it is to the worn-out
fisher.
A new scheme of the sharking “agent” is
to set himself up as an official from the
N.S.W. Taxation Department, and go round
with sheaves of income-tax forms, which he
fills up for a fee of five shillings. The job
may be worth the money. Still the “agent”
evidently doesn’t believe his “clients” would
think so if he told them the truth.
Rechabites can rejoice in the fact that
the Australian temperance-drink industry
has risen to the occasion. The Defence
Department recently issued a pressing order
for 8000 dozen of aerated waters —presum-
ably for Red Cross purposes. The lot had
to be shipped almost immediately, and one
firm (Rowlands), by working at high pres-
sure, was able to supply the whole 96,000
bottles.

Shoddy is in for a colder time in Maori-
land. Any article of footwear which looks
like leather and is generally charged for at
leather prices, but is discovered to be merely
brown paper on the first wet day, will for
the future have to carry a label to the
effect that it’s a fraud. Real leather goods
will not need to be stamped, but anybody
selling, or even having in stock, pulp boots
that are unstamped will be liable to a pen-
alty up to £2O.
* * * *
“Nemesis”: “T. 0.1.” discourses on some
ancient trade signs in Sydney (B. 24/12/T4).
Here are two from Victoria. Some 10 or
12 years ago two Bungs in Fitzroy displayed
these signs outside their respective inns—
“ The Labor in Vain,” portraying a black
brother being scrubbed, and the “Persever-
ance,” showing black brother as a piebald.
The latter hostelry has since been rebuilt,
and the last time I saw it the sign had dis-
appeared. -
* * * *
“Moutere”: Why is the telegraph infant
or insect not required to obtain a receipt
for the telegram he delivers? A few weeks
ago I sent a message and received no answer.
A fortnight afterwards I discovered that
my wire had been shoved under the door of
a temporarily empty house. Of course, I
made a complaint, but all the satisfaction I
got was that the crime was the work of an
“extra” boy, who was no longer available
to be spanked, discharged or otherwise dealt
with. Thus the P.M.G. had taken my six-
pence for work which he undertook to do,
but did not make even a decent attempt
to carry out, and when the offence was
proved his minions neither apologised nor
offered to return my money. It would be
interesting to know how many telegrams
are thrown away by “extra” boys, as well
as by the permanent insects that crawl
about the city. A book of receipts kept for
the signature of those who receive telegrams
would get rid of nearly all the trouble. As
for my sixpence, I intend to demand it of
W. G. Spence the next time I see his
patriarchal beard.
“II.O.”: I first met Harold Hartington at
Geelong. He was there with the object of
ascertaining if the village was deserving of
a visit from his “stupendous aggregation of
histrionic talent.” Clayton asked Harold if
he knew Caleb Sewell, who was due next
week with a stupendous aggregation of hi i
own. It transpired that Mr. Hartington did
know Mr. Sewell, and we soon learned that
Mr. Sewell was a liar, an agnostic, a wife-
beater, a disloyalist and an amateur gard-
ener, who in his time had been guilty of
bigamy, attempted bribery, mixed bathing
and several plots to collect the maternity
bonus by fraud. Still, Harold confessed,
with evident reluctance, that Sewell had one
redeeming feature —he could act. Much as
he (Harold) loathed and despised him, he
was compelled to admit that the fellow was
an artist. Harold’s story was duly circu-
lated, and all but the truly virtuous decided
that they must certainly see such a genius
as he was acknowledged to be even by his
enemy. I attended the first-night perform-
ance and found Caleb’s acting more awful
than that of any mummer I had seen outside
the metropolis. Having cursed Hartington
for a fool, I forgot about him until a month
later, when I was in Camperdown. He was
there and still attacking Caleb’s morals
while eulogising his art. Subsequently I
met Harold at Horsham, and he was on the
same lay. At Murtoa I forced a confession
from him at the point of a loaded decanter.
He was not an actor with a “stupendous
aggregation” of his own, but was Caleb
Sewell’s trusted advance agent; and it was
with Caleb’s knowledge and consent that he
circulated untruths anent that gentleman’s
moral worthlessness, by way of lending force
to equally unveracious rumors concerning
his histrionic worth.
HOW SHE BROUGHT HOME THE SOAP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Business as usual. —British tradesman’s motto.
When England’s siege-guns bellowed
Across the trembling world,
And autumn leaves were yellowed,
And standards were unfurled,
Light-footed, trim and eager,
Fragile, yet full of hope,
The dauntless Wimmens’ Leaguer
Sailed out to buy some soap.
What cared she for the tramcars
That rumbled back and forth,
And all the other d —n cars
That hooted in their wrath!
With colors bravely flying
And grease-paint on her face,
To find the grocer, lying,
She flew with girlish grace.
Then spies and envious neighbors
Left hearth and grate and stove —
They ceased their servile labors
And in curl-papers strove
To see where she was going
And what she meant to do,
In dainty muslins flowing,
With eyes of Saxon blue.
She fluttered on unheeding
The jealous rage and spite;
’Twas soap that she was needing,
And crow-like was her flight;
Indomitable, speedy,
Relentless, proudly gay,
She sought the grocer seedy
In her Britannic way.
The grocer marked her coming,
Observed her eyes of blue,
And asked in accents humming:
“What can I do for you?
“What can / do for you, Miss?”
He buzzed, instinct with hope.
“The weather’s warmish? True, Miss!”
She said: “I want some soap.”
The grocer did not quibble,
But. wrapped some soap with speed,
And did a lightning scribble
In some book grocers heed.
The cash thing pealed its warning,
The change was passed, and lo !
Farewells and good-byes scorning,
She went! He watched her go.

KLti\
Kephaldol, the new-found remedy for pain, is
the product of one of the Continent’s most famous
specialists. (Manufactured in Austra ia.)
Kephaldol is sure, quick-acting, and kills pain
without the risk of any harm to those who use it.
Unlike other remedies used for Headache, Neu-
ralgia, Neuritis, etc., Kephaldol does not affect
or depress the heart action. IT IS SAFE TO
USE in large or small doses. Doctors by the
hundreds have reported it to be unequalled for the
above troubles, as well as for Rheumatism, Sciatica,
Painful Menstruation and nerve pains generally.
It is guaranteed under the Pure Food Act 1908
of N.S.W., and no other painkiller has the endorse-
ment of the Medical Profession enjoyed by
Kephaldol.
DOCTORS RECOMMEND IT.—"'
“I gave Kephaldol tablets in a severe case of Sciatica
and the result was most gratifying.”

No refiledy over placed before Hit' public
has ever been so fully taken into the confi-

and they have proved very beneficial to me,
and I have great faith in them as
a family medicine. They are my only
medicine, and I would not be without them.
My wife and family all use them with
splendid results. I have been a resident of

POLITICAL
POINTS
AFTER ALL HE HAS BORROWED, TOO!
Last month’s N.S.W. State revenue decreased
£12,649, while the expenditure increased £10,846.
HOLMAN : “ That's strange —it wan't balance!”
The shortest and brightest proposition to
come before the N.S.W. Political Labor
Congress is supplied by Petersham.
Petersham suggests, by way of a new plank,
that the Holman Government should pay
some attention to the old planks.
The curse of drink has struck the
Scaddan Government of Westralia. It pro-
posed that State-owned hotels should be
exempt from the supervision of the State
Licensing Boards —the bodies which dis-
qualify dirty, dilapidated, ill-conducted or
superfluous premises. The idea that the
Ministry was afraid its pubs couldn’t stand
inspection broke the Assembly up. and the
scheme was defeated by two votes.
Apparently the N.S.W. Government will
presently have to run for its life if it pro-
poses to keep ahead of tlie frenzied demand
for the totalisator. Something like a score
of leagues have put this subject down for
discussion at the State Political Labor Con-
gress. Now an agile Labor Minister might
explain to one league bis preference for the
Private Enterprise bookie as against the
socialistic tote, but explaining to 20 leagues
is a large order.
The Gerhog Government played a dirty
trick on the English manufacturers who bad
money due from Germany when the war
broke out. But in dealing with tlie Com-
monwealth Treasury in the little matter
of Papuan salaries, bow honest, bow
prompt, was the German 1 What a shining
example of rectitude! Likewise what an
artless admission that tlie Government in
Berlin still thinks of a day when Australia
will be glad to cast off the “hateful British
yoke” in favor of the benevolent German
article! The Kaiser’s diplomats may be
stupid, but not quite so stupid as to bilk
the expected fish of a little bit of bait.
The confirmed importer lias some weird
arguments. One of the tribe told Frank
Tudor, Minister for Customs, the other day
that tlie cigar industry in Australia was so
insignificant that if the tariff on cigars was
reduced to the old rates and the industry
slaughtered, the duty on the extra importa-
tions would provide enough revenue to pay
each of tlie technical workers thrown out of
a job £i> a week for 50 weeks in tlie year,
lie forgot to mention the fact that, if the
work wasn’t done in Australia, much money
would he sent out of Australia to pay for
the foreign cigars—money which would
otherwise stay in the country. And he didn’t
explain how any industry was ever likely to
become large if it was slaughtered in its
infancy just because it happened to be small.
Even an importer wouldn’t be stout in bis
old age if he was killed before be became an
importer just because he was a babe.
RAISER BILL COLLECTS ANOTHER
ENEMY.
HOLMAN: “D — n the Raiser!”
Many people in N.S.W. are tearing their
hair over the income-tax returns. The
Government-That-Is-Always-In-A-Hurry has
decreed that everybody who has any kind of
a private revenue, even if it is only 6d., must
fill up a huge form worth perhaps 2d., and
put it in a big envelope worth probably Mi-
ami send it along (postage about 2d.), in
order to show that he or she isn’t liable for
Jd. Failing this, the penalty may be £lOO. It
looked very large and honest and copious when
the Act was passed, but the demand for forms
became serious, and the wear and tear of
clerks became terrible. So informal
announcements began to appear in the
papers (price Id.) to the effect that
people with incomes below £2OO a
year need not fill in the half-acre
of document. Unfortunately the law
still stands, and the possible fine of £lOO
still stands, and verbal assurances or in-
formal promises made by clerks across the
office counter seem dubious coinage. The
“official notification sets forth to the bitter end
that a return must be supplied by “every
person.... deriving income in any way or
from any source in New South Wales.” So
The Bulletin’s youngest office boy got
half a day off and filled in his paper.
Melbourne Argtjs and its correspondents
keep harping on the idea that in this time
of stress wages boards’ determinations
should be suspended, and Fat. instead of
sacking half his employees, should be allowed
to retain them at (say) half the present
wages. But why all this fuss? If he really
wants to minimise unemployment, there is
an easy way open to him. There is nothing
to prevent him working his employees half-
time—week on and week off —at the legal
■wage rates. Fat’s solicitude for the unem-
ployed would look less hypocritical if he
adopted a scheme of that sort.
THE HOLM AIM GOVERNMENT'S NEW
PUBLIC HEALTH AMENDMENT
BILL LEAVES THE PROBLEM OF
VENEREAL DISEASES STILL UN-
UNTOUCHED.
Kecp'i t lighting in the North Sea shows
that the German ships carry the bulk of
their guns at the stern; the British ships
have most of theirs well forward. The
German ships are evidently built to fire as
they run away ; the British to fire as they
chase the enemy. It is a most suitable
arrangement, and doubtless someone on the
German side will get an iron cross or a tin
eagle for thinking it out.
The N.S.W. State Government was very
gracious again the other day. It announced
that the law of the State which says that a
citizen may not carry firearms on the
Sabbath would not be rigidly enforced. Any
section of the Defence force of the Common-
wealth which takes its rifles out on Sunday
afternoons will therefore be free from
arrest. But the N. S. Wales Government
reserves the right to sool on its bobby if the
Australian proceeds to desecrate Sunday
mornings by making himself ready to defend
the country. Wei], the country deserves
this sort of thing for putting up with the
present absurd system of government.
Maybe Italy’s “lone hand” will have to
be pushed into the war sooner than was
expected; for should the Turks seriously
menace the Suez Canal, then, according to
many Italian statesmen, Italy will have
to take a hand at once. This was pointed
out as long ago as the middle of December
in the national Senate by a distinguished
Dago, who said that any danger to the
Canal was too direct a menace to Italy to
be disregarded. Wherefore many things are
less likely than that the first foreigner to
stand alongside the Australian in battle
will be the deliberate gentleman who at
home sells him the banan’.
One of the surprises when the N.S.W. Labor
Caucus selected a State Ministry at the
beginning of last year was the inclusion of
William George Ashford. Nobody had ever
heard of William George before; but there
was a vague belief that he was, in some way.
connected with “the land,” and, therefore,
eminently qualified to be a Minister for Agri-
culture. Whatever he was he has not been
a shining success. Still, there are compen-
sations even in failure. Thus, during the
discussions that took place on the Wheat
Acquisition Bill, it was Attorney-General
Ilall, and not Ashford, who had everything
to say in explanation and defence of that
Bill; and now that Nick Mutton, solicitor
Drew, the £lOOO, and other matters con-
nected with wheat contracts are being talked
of, Ashford may be glad that he wasn’t
trusted with the official explanations and
defences. His own most startling utterance of
late was that he found himself most pro-
foundly affected by the bagpipes; and as
long as he sticks to oracular remarks of that
kind he will be all right.
For the last four months the German
field guns have been roaring helplessly at
their superior French brothers from a camp
on the Aisne where the warring Ciesar once
wintered in the mouldy long ago. If that
conveys nothing to the mind of the inild-
eyed, hopeful Peace fiend, then he is the
maddest dervish of the crowd.
In Melbourne the need for doing some-
thing to protect those who set out to
acquire their sticks on the hire system is
becoming so apparent that soon there will
be danger of even Peacock or. John Weary
noticing it. Just
now employment in
Melbourne is not
plentiful, and many
who still have jobs
are working half-
time or less. This
is right into the
maw of the time-
payment shark, who
in several instances
has seized furniture
on which many in-
stalments have been
paid, owing to the
hire-purchaser fall-
ing a week or two
behind. A firm that
demands the return
of goods which have
been in part paid for
should be in the same
position as a mort-
gagee—entitled to
sell the stuff by
public auction, but compelled to hand to the
original purchaser the balance remaining
after the debt has been liquidated.
Melbourne’s Women’s Hospital is blaming
the Maternity Bonus for a large increase in
the number of cases of septicaemia treated.
It argues, and no doubt rightly, that the
bonus has induced many poor women, who
without it would have come to the hospital,
to experience their little adventures in their
own homes under the care of a more or less
experienced nurse; and the trouble is that
many of these “nurses” are a good deal less
experienced than more. It isn’t fair, how-
ever, to blame the bonus. The fault lies
entirely with the State Government, which
has been repeatedly asked to insist on the
registration of nurses and permit practice by
qualified ones only. It is even more im-
portant that midwives should be qualified
than doctors, because in many cases they
are the sole attendants, and when the doctor
is called in the mischief is done. Yet
Victoria’s lazy Government allows anyone,
even Ah Slim, to practise as a midwife (or
mid-husband) if so minded and if he. she or
it can get enough victims to make it worth
while.
SPELL-O!
They must develop the social side —mix the books
and lectures with the billiards and the innocent
entertainment. — Joe Cook at Parramatta.
JOE COOK : "Miss De Vere (puff), shail we
sit outside now (puff) white I read you
(puff) a Herald leader?”
Melbourne’s Tramway Trust proceeds de-
liberately with its scheme to buy out the
plant of the company when the latter’s lease
expires next year, and at latest had decided
to take counsel’s opinion as to its power.
Heaven knows what use gent, one’s opinion
will be, seeing that if the Trust has the
power it hasn’t the money, and can’t get it
without Parliamentary authority; and no
Parliament would dream of handing over
Melbourne’s tramway system to the eleven
inner councils which guaranteed the cost of
the original lines. The whole outfit —cable
and electric lines and all —must be placed
under one comprehensive body—Greater
Melbourne Council or Tramway Commis-
sion, it doesn’t much matter which.
A PRAYER IN TIME OF HASTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., said he disagreed with
Mr. James. Lack of time prevented him from
detailing one tithe of the Labor Party’s iniquities.
There was no difference in political immorality
between the State and Federal Houses'.' They were
full brothers, and were out to debauch the whole
community.-— Report of N.S.W. Liberal meeting.
He’d like to make your heart-strings quake with gory
tales of crime;
Your blood would chill to hear him spill his elo-
quence sublime;
Your minds he’d glut with horror -but there really
isn’t time.
Too short a span for mortal man has been allowed
by fate
Before he spits his final hits at objects of his hate,
And with his spleen not voided clean he passes
Heaven’s gate.
For fifty years his ghastly fears he tells with cries
of woe —
A pantomime of Labor crime, that makes a grisly
show ;
Yet things of dread remain unsaid when it is time
to go.
Go down to Hell and search it well; sweep out its
darkest nook,
And lift the lid from pot and grid where nameless
vices cook,
You scarce could glean the things obscene that meet
Fitzpatrick’s look.
To Deeming down from Nero’s crown, from Borgia
on to Burke,
Crime, lust and hate have choked the State —the
bowl, the rope, the dirk. -v
Now Fitz proclaims our greater shames; but it’s a
lifetime’s work.
Holman and Hughes he’d fain abuse while breath is
in his throat;
The damnedest Hun has never done such deeds as
Fitz would quote,
Did not their crime exceed the time allotted to his
gloat.
Iniquities that burn and freeze the souls of men
away,
Could be revealed were he unsealed for fifty hours
a day ;
Since he may roar but twenty-four, we can but
watch and pray.
The Prayer.
From Labor’s guile and Devil’s wile, from spool; and
succubus,
From Fisher’s views and Billy Hughes, and Helioga-
balus,
From. Ilell-hounds fierce and Cann and Pearce, good
Lord deliver us !
From beasts immense and old-man Spence, and the
monstrous fiend Cau-Cus,
From gangrened cysts and Socialists y from Jims who
miss the ’bus.
From Tudor's sib, and Flibbertigib, good Lord deliver
us!
From Labor laws and the worm that gnaws with a
tooth lascivious,
From Union vote and tiger’s throat, and the prowl-
ing platypus,
From the Bible Beast and Fisher at least, good Lord
deliver us !

NOTIONS
Premier Peacock states that the \ ic-
Ministry is divided on the Tote question, and will
leave the long-overdue Bill to he introduced bv a
private member, so there is but a poor chance of any
Bill passing. The large number of people who would
be glad to see the clean, honest betting machine
established for morality's sake and sport s sake, as
well as for the sake of the public charities, are a
careless, disorganised crowd; whereas the smallei
number of people who object to the tote on
“religious” grounds, or for business reasons, or be-
cause their simple ignorance has been imposed upon,
are well organised and spiritedly led. The book-
makers devote a good deal of money and artfulness
to the maintenance of their business, which, by the
way, would be an easier and better business for the
c'eaner members of the “ring” but for the fraterni-
tvfs of gambling rogues who live by backing ’orses.
These latter are more deeply, but less noisily, inter-
ested in blocking the totalisator than even the fatu-
ous wowsers. They are, perhaps, the most useful o:
Ikey Mo’s allies; and they are certainly the most
destructive foes of ordinary punters, in that they get
the cream of the odds against genuine triers, and are
the authors of all tire swindles whereby ordinary
punters so often fall in.

Not more than a dozen nags from Sydney
are likely to cut in for the principal _ stakes at
Melbourne’s Summer-Autumn meetings, but the
little lot includes some of the best. At Caulfield,
next Saturday, the local quality of horesflesh will
be put to the test of comparison in two or three
events. Should Woorak risk a penalty by going for
the Oakleigh Plate (5J furlongs) the punters who
saw his mad performance in the V.lt.C. Derby will
mostly be afraid to back anything else. With
9st. 31b. up, he will look equal to the job. The colt
is said to have increased his velocity since November,
and in this sprint he can meet the talked-of Flash of
Steel on 101 b. better than their Newmarket Handi-
cap terms. Anyhow, they will both be going for
the Futurity Stakes a week later.
Land of Song has been entered for something
next Saturday, but will probably make his first
Australian appearance in the Futurity aforesaid,
which is a unique variety of w.f.a. race. All doubt
about Land of Song being a possible starter for the
Newmarket was settled last week. He was scratched.
If the reputed top-notcher is to be kept for classy
events, as is stated, the owner only knows why he
wasn’t scratched for the Australian Cup also.

Adelaide Racing Club held its' Foundation
Day meeting on ajj afternoon, whep 109,8 was regis-
tered in the shade. Still, South Australia’s heat is
dry, wherefore cricket and tennis and other sports'
were carried on, too) without harm tci anybody.
Even this thermometer: reading has been beaten, for
on the same day nine years ago 110 was just
reached. Those two should surely claim the
record. For city courses, that is, For up-country
tracks, hardened old racegoers will doubtless claim
any old figures, and, like the Respectable .Married
Lady in the pantomime, “defy you to prove’it?*'

Another boomed lad from U.S.A., where
the wooden bacon comes from, was laid to rest at
the Stadium (Sydney) on Saturday night. That
was Eddie Miller, who was heralded as having “a
remarkable record as a boxer in the United States.
He has never yet been beaten, and the men he has
met include some of the best at their weight in
America.” The other boy, Waverley Geikie, is a
Queenslander, and he, too, has never been beaten,
although he has not had much experience of the
professional ring. If Miller has lived with some of
the best feathers in U.S., it must have been out of
sheer desire on their part to be obliging—or else
he had forgoten his trade on Saturday night. He
looked like a novice, and, after the calm, deliberate
knock-out handed him, he must have felt a novice.
Undoubtedly Geikie is a born boxer—cool, calculat-
ing and quick-handed. His right-cross, which lie
seems to have made a specialty of, is something to
utterly decline acquaintance with. In the third
round the American was pounded down and took
9sec. After that it was a mere matter of minutes,
and the fourth session was the last. The Banana-
lander shepherded his opponent into position and
quietly sent him along a lullaby. The towel went
in from the stranger’s corner before the count-out,
but it was all the same to Miller.

The Australian Pugs’ .Union is on strike
against the pay-rates of Stadiums, Ltd. Briefly, the
position is that the employers part with 25 per cent,
of the gross takings at the gate to the hands engaged
on the job; the latter contend that, owing to the
cost of living, motor-cars, etc., 30 per cent, is the
least they can do with. The co. points out that
since its formation it has been unable to pay a
dividend, and adds that if the Pugs’ Union persists
in its unreasonable demand Capital will sky the
towel, and the stoush emporiums at Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Brisbane will he closed. The first defi-
nite sign of the conflict is the removal of the name
of Les O’Donnell, and the substitution of that of
Jeff Smith, as the opponent of Harold Hardwick
when that ex-pillar of the amateur ring makes his
first appearance in Sydney as a pro. O’Donnell
belongs to the union, and Smith is a free glove-
laborer. All he desires is the right to live and
the left to wallop. Wherefore he will accept the
bosses’ offer of 25 per cent, and chance unpopularity.
It seems to The Bulletin that if booze is a neces-
sary commodity so is bash; which opens the way

Fanny Durack, of Australia, lias beaten
her own world’s swimming record of lmin. 18 l-ssec.
for the 100 metres. It happened on Saturday at the
championship meeting of the N.S.W. Amateur Ladies’
Swimming Association, in the Domain baths, when
the time was clipped to lmin. 16 l-ssee. It was a
great sw'im, but the handicapping was more than
the girl-fish could match. A starter with SOsec. was
first, Miss Durack being fourth. At the Olympic
Games at Stockholm, in 1912, her time was Imm.
19 4-ssec. On Saturday she won the 100yds. cham-
pionship of the State in 1 min. 8 2-ssec. Mina
Wylie was second and Lottie Fevyer third. The
tvinner was not unduly hurried.

“Billy” Longworth is swimming so well
just now that great efforts have been made to
arrange a race between him and Duke Kahanamoku
over the 220yds. distance, and much disappoint-
ment is felt at the apparent hopelessness of bringing
it off. On Saturday, at Lavender Bay, Sydney,
Longworth won the 220yds. championship of Eastern
Suburbs in 2min. 32 l-ssec. Beaurepaire’s Aus-
tralasian record is 2min. 28 2-ssec, and Longworth
has done better than 2min. 32 l-ssec. himself.
Against the Hawaiian he would, fit and well, doubt-
less do much bette r . Kahanamoku suggests the
bath at the ’Frisco Exhibition during the Games as
the best place to decide the argument.
The Tanunda (S.A.) people, mostly of
German extraction, have held their annual meeting
to settle the “kingship” for rifle-shooting. _ The first
two places went to Lake and Fielding, visitors from
Adelaide, and frequent prizewinners in the past.
But Liebelt and Grocke and Nitschke and Dier and
Dald were close up; and the shooting was done on
Mrs. Menner’s land; and Mrs. Heinemann provided
lunch ; and Juttner conducted the band ; and another
Juttner, as president, congratulated the winner, who
was decorated with the customary wreath by Miss
Schulz. Secretary Henzenroeder, who ran the whole
thing, mentioned at the subsequent banquet that any
number of German-named Australians —including
one Kaysar ! —have gone to the front
to fight against much the same sort
of bullying tyranny as drove the best
men out of Prussia three-quarters of
a century ago.

The remarkable success of Murray Bridge
in S. Australian rowing has attracted attention to
the river as a nursery for oarsmen. The “Bridge”,
style does not blend over-well with that of the
Adelaide clubs, and, as distance prevents joint prac-
tice, it has happened that the Murray Club’s best
crew has liad to row as representing the whole State.
A sporting annual round has now been arranged, City
crews visiting the Bridge for a regatta on Saturday,
and all parties then moving up-river to Mannum for
the Foundation Day holiday. Bridgeport and Tailern
Bend are other river clubs that now compete, and, of
the visitors, one boat this year .came from as far away
as Port Pirie. Excepting for ladies’ races, Murray
Bridge scooped most of the events on both days.
The Rugby League of N. S., • Wales will
have a visit from a Maoriland team this season and
will return the compliment. In the Loanly Isle?
the game is struggling to find a place in the. .-suju
of public esteem, but it isn’t making' a,Conspicuous',
success of the job. Nevertheless, a smart -team is
expected to cross the Tasman and play in N. S.
Wales and Queensland. The N.S.W. Rugby Union,
on the ground that “this is no time or sport,” has
wiped all representative fixtures off its slate, and
the Metropolitan Union will limit the competition
games to just sufficient to keep members physically
fit. As much spare time as possible will be given
over to drill in the evenings and on Saturday
afternoons.
* * * *
“’Oof Ball”: N.S.W. Football Union lias
followed the example of file English Cricket County
Clubs, and will subordinate play to drill. The
League, on the other hand, explains that by keeping
going it helps players and others to the extent of
£lOO a week. It isn’t much of an explanation;
and, anyway, what about the crowds of men who
spend their leisure howling’ on the bank at the
games? What good are they getting out of it?
Federal Attorney-General Hughes tersely remarked
last .week that people of a certain mould failed to
read the accounts of the bloody encounters in Flan-
ders and Poland with the same interest with which
they followed cricket, football and racing. The
truth in this remark stings. The writer realised it
one night recently at a picture-show. The principal
film was a battle story. It was an ingenious fake,
of course, but the frightful meaning of war was
vividly produced. The next item was “Topical
Gazette—Australia: Country Tennis Week, Double
Bay, Sydney.” The startling contrast, the fatuity
of big men rushing after tennis balls, 'while the mind
was still under the influence of the horrors merely
hinted at a few minutes earlier, evidently struck the
audience, for a queer, rustling noise went right
round the building. I suspect that picture-showman
of being a recruiting-sergeant in disguise. I know
we can’t all go to the front, and we must have
relaxation; but cut out the cant that the football
league is patriotically helping the Empire by run-
ning a big season in order to pay some wages, mostly
to men who are already getting wages. The League
hopes to extract £lO,OOO gross as a moderate esti-
mate this year from the public, and £lO,OOO would
equip a battalion, or thereabouts.

“Chug-chug”: Why do returned trippers
always try to disparage Australia ? If this country
and its people are no good 'it is quite easy to stay
away. John Ferguson, Scotchbyterian divine, re-
turned to Sydney after a 12 months’ absence, and
at once told us that the serious-mindedness of the
British public respecting the war was in contrast
to the indifference in Australia. “He declares,” said the
S. M. Herald summary, “that all the British boxers
have gone to the front, and he expresses surprise
that boxing is continued in Sydney.” In the same
issue of the same paper appeared a cable from
London which set forth that “Johnny Summers
(ex-eliampion) met the Lonsdale* belt holder, Private
Basham, who recently defeated him for the title,
in a return match at Liverpool. Basham won on
points.” Has Liverpool been bombed out of
Britain? Or is John Ferguson’s statement merely
another instance of the serious-minded handling
the truth carelessly ?

The visit of Spalding’s team, in 1889,
first interested Australians in baseball. Since then
the game has had its ups
and downs, but during the
last two or three years has
leaped ahead, particularly
in Sydney. Last season
some 60 clubs and 20
junior . clubs were under the
control of the N.S.W.
Baseball Assoc. The game
is played regularly in the
winter in N. S. Wales, Vic-
toria, S. Australia and Tas-
mania. It is also played in
summer in the Ma State.
The schools in N.S.W. and
Vic. play it, and there is a
junior assoc, in Adelaide.
The visit of the Giants-
White Sox outfit from Uncle
Dollar’s Land in Jan-
uary of last year gave the
thing a big boost, and, in-
cidentally, was an educa-
tion to Australian players,
the tourists being high-
class professional players.
The prospects of the com-
ing winter are good, pro-
vided war does not unduly
interfere. Substantial in-
creases in the numbers
playing are expected, not-
withstanding that many ’bailers have already
swapped club for rifle.
Unless something unforeseen occurs the inter-
state Baseball Carnival (N. S. Wales, Victoria and
S. Australia) will be held in Adelaide this year.

In preparation for the football season
the Vic. League lately took the opinions of its
nine clubs (there used to be 10, but ’Varsity has
withdrawn) on certain weighty matters, and will
proceed to carry out the decisions as far as it can.
It was singular that to every proposal put to the
clubs seven agreed and two objected, though they
were in no ease the same two. Also, it was more
than singular that Richmond and Melbourne, whose
average attendances are the poorest, were the two
who objected to pooling the “gates” and paying
players out of the proceeds. South and Carlton
alone objected to having “one ruling body for Vic.
football,” which in effect meant the disappearance
of the Association ; Essendon and ’Wood were against
the League’s quaint scheme of “district” football
(this scheme puts Fern Tree Gully in “Melbourne,”
and Mitcham in “Collingwood”) ; and ’Roy and
Richmond were against abandoning the usual S’Aus-
tralian fixture this season. Also a majority favored
having but nine, teams for the season, as a trial.
The delegates wdte further notified that the S. Aus.
League and the" NjS.W/ Rugby League—there was
no mention of'ith'e'RugbyV.tlnion—had agreed to the
proposed hybrid game, but in the absence of exact
information as to the changes the League postponed
consideration. This was pyobably just as well,
because in view of the capers- of Billy the Mad Goat
and the necessity for correcting them, there may not
be much ’ball this season. Certainly this isn’t the
time to begin to popularise a new game, however
improved it may be.
Davis (hip -tennis h? “off” for 1915. The
IT. S.,< which -was the oifly likely challenger, lias
decided Jxf let it slide oh account of the war; so
Australia will hold the Clip for another 12 months.
When it was last .sighted the Cup, by the way, was
actually in. America. 1
At Maori'] aprl’s lawn tennis champion-
ship contests, which''took place recently in Dunedin,
there were no surprises like those of last year, when the
alleged champions went a| seven for sixpence. This
year the acknowledged players swept the board.
G. Ollivier, champion in 1911, took the men’s
singles, and with F. Wilding (a brother of Anthony)
also won the men’s doubles. In the ladies’ singles,
Miss A. Gray, last year’s champion, showed that
she was still ditto; while the combined doubles were
annexed by a veteran player from Christchurch, W.
Goss, who had Miss 12. M. Baird for his partner.
Canterbury took the championship banner with 121
points. Auckland was second with 51.
Another body that begs to be excused on
account of war is N. S. Wales Cricket Assoc. The
proposed invasion of Westralia and Tasmania is
definitely off.
The beginning of the eighth round of First-
grade Cricket in Sydney on Saturday was a bean-
feast for the bowlers. Trundling' for Waverley
against Gordon, Flynn closed the day’s business with
eight for 20. He got six for 16 in the first innings
and so far as the second innings went he bagged
two for four. Macartney, who was bowled first ball
(by Shea, who collected three for 34), then took a
hand with the ball and got some of his own back
with an average of five for 38. For University,
against Cumberland, Minnett sent six batsmen baik
for 38 and his ally Gregg got four for 20. Wall, for
Balmain, against Middle Harbor, routed four of the
enemy in the first innings for 24. He was assisted
by Arnott, who could get only four for 29. in
second-grade (second-grade is mostly a total
stranger), Gibbons, North Sydney, downed five
of Mosman for 25. In retaliation, Jacob, of
Mosman, obliterated six for 31, and Chap-
man gave him moral support and Christian sym-
pathy with four for 25. Three for 28 (Andrews, of
Gordon) is hardly worth mentioning, but the con-
tribution by Frances of seven Gordon lives for 46
is received with applause. Ditto, Penman (5-49),
Balmain; Lisle (5-47), Paddington; T. Owen
(3-14), Western Suburbs; Leggo (4-18), Peter-
sham; Flack (4-16), Leichhardt; Wallace (3-9),
University. Kellewav (run out, 138) was the only
batsman to reach three figures.
* * * *
Victorian bowler E. A. McDonald, who-
captured four wickets for 90 against N.S.W., and
11 for 74 against Queensland, is the season’s only-
fast inter-State trundler. It was his first appearance
in Sheffield Shield cricket, and provided he makes
good in the last match (against South Aus.), he
should have more than an ordinary chance of a
seat in the future Australian XI. Just how future
the next Australian -XI will be nobody knows.
* * * *
A. E. J. Collins, smiter of the world’s
record cricket score of 628 —it was at Clifton College
(Eng.), in 1899—was killed lately in the war that
William made.
At a cricket match played on the South
Melbourne ground recently the “Biffs” made 165
runs for the loss of five wickets. Then the Arous
team,-which, as a rule, gives a good account of
itself, fell down dead for three runs. Lockyer (of
the South Melbourne C.C. second eleven) outed five
of them for none, and Franks (of the South Mel-
bourne Footballers’ C.C.) dissolved the other five
for three. Only 36 balls were bowled.
Some ex-Australian XI trundlers keep
up the old traditions in junior cricket. At Penrith
(N.S.W.) the other day Bill Howell gathered 10
wickets for 33 runs against Mount Druitt. Ernest
Jones —one time “the Australian Express”—went
even better at Fremantle (W.A.) by taking 12 for
32 runs.
* * * *
Austin Diamond, the secretary of the
rifle-club movement among cricketers in Sydney, has
represented N.S.W. at both cricket and baseball.
’Way back in 1907 he scored 210 runs v. Victoria,
and' joined the few batsmen who had crossed the
double-century line in Australian cricket. Diamond
has added the ginger of enthusiasm to whatever lie
has touched ; and the care of this comer of the rifle
movement is therefore in good hands.
Championship games have’ been in pro-
gress on N. S. Wales and Victorian bowling greens
during the week. In Sydney, competitors had been
reduced to four in the single-handed pla.v, but not
without strenuous contests in trying conditions.
The scoffer who reckons that bowls are a mild form
of exercise desig-ned to enable old buffers to get up
an appetite for the afternoon’s whisky should have
been on the lawns on one of last week’s humid days,
rolling wood for four or five hours. He would
have come away' wiser and more respectful. I p at
Newcastle, too, championship games have _ been
arousing interest. Hingst,. who won the singles,
belongs to a family of bowlers. Ilis father and
brother have also held the championship.
Walter Bleach, the Victorian bowling
champion, is one of those who have more than one
life in the game. Time after time he has blossomed
forth anew as a record breaker. Almost two decades
have passed since lie first came into prominence, and
in the days of the great Waverley Carnival, when it
was decided to give the fixture to N.S.W. and
Victoria alternately, Bleach was champion at the
Melbourne meeting. Without doubt no bearer of
the title has more deserved it and few are as populai
with fellow-plavers.

“Balloon Jib’': Betting on the sailing
laces in Port Jackson is more modest than at Rand-
wick, but the impoverished times should make that
an attraction. About two dozen boats start each
-’ahmlav in two heats and a final (.10 to 12 race in the
final). Punters can bet straight on the three events,
or on the double, at liberal odds. It is a rare thing
fur a particular boat to get home first more than
three times in a season, and the winning of any
!ieat,v let-alone the double, is a difficult job. t\lnu
with -tricks of wind, tide and weather, mistakes on

“One Star” : Jack Donaldson deserved bis
defeat by W. R.’ Applegartli.- The ex-amateur
harrier had never run 100yds. in better than
9 4-ssec„ and the challenge was looked upon by
the Australian as a “soft tiling.” Backers or
Donaldson laid 9 to 4 “on.” In the race, Apple-
garth rushed away and had a lead of 3vds. at 50
and won by 9 inches. The time —9 9-10 see-
.- that Applegartli ran lvd. worse than his
amateur best, while Donaldson was yards behind his
most hurried effort —9 3-Ssec. in 1910. i rivate
advices state that Donaldson will come to Aus-
tralia to take part in a series of professional an-
nuals which are to he syndicated by somebody who

Exercise is the
Key of Health.
r
Your fftture health and strength depend upon exercise-
Exercise is the judicious movement of the organs of the bodv, so
that they will not become flabby through want of use.
When an organ becomes flabby, it cannot carry out its functions
in a natvtral way. It goes from bad to worse. Eventually, it is
a source of never-ending annoyance —then chronic ill-health.
Judicious exercise cuts out monotony, accomplishes permanent
results quickly, takes up very little time, and every movement
goes to the right spot.
The Baker Postal Course of Health
and Strength Exercises
consists of exorcises best suited to the individual.
It is the key to better health and greater strength.
It’s benefiting hundreds throughout Australia and
New Zealand. It’s making them stronger and
better men. Here’s one pupil’s experience:—

Great Danger of
Insed Bites.
DOCTOR’S ALARMING STATEMENT.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by using
NEV-A-BITE
“There is no question/’ says a leading
specialist, “that insect bites may lead to great
danger to health, and have been known to end
fatally.’’
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect
bite might set up
such serious in-
flammation as to
cause blood-poi-
soning, and —as everyone well knows—blood-
poisoning may lead to even the amputation of
a limb.
One has only to glance at the illustration
given here of the mosquito to realise what
terrifying poison-injecting parts this insect
has. It is absolutely necessary, not only for
the woman who desires to keep her complexion
in its natural condition, but also for the pro-
tection against more serious dangers, to secure
some reliable preparation which will prevent
insects from biting.
The best form of treatment of mosquito bites
is prophylactic, or preventive. The application
of a little of the Nev-a-bite lotion to the
forehead, neck and the instep (when openwork
stockings are worn) reduces the probability of
mosquito-bites to a minimum.
Nev-a-bite is a perfectly harmless pre-
paration, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.

The share capital is £75,000, and on the
foregoing figures £64,431 of it is intact: the
balance is made up of goodwill, preliminary
exes, and trading debit. The more or less
tangible assets total £86,620; but against
them there are liabilities amounting to
£22,189. The tangible assets include book
debts, £12,563; stock, £35,155; plant,
£22.504; factory (presumably freehold),
£(5904; and liquid items, £5293. After pro-
viding for liabilities there is in these items
£6O 230, which means 16s. per share. But
plainly the assets are not worth 16s. ‘ to
the shareholders as things have been' going
lately. A plant, for instance, which can’t
grind out profits is not worth £22,504 to
keep; and for breaking-up purposes it is
worth far less than £22.504. The whole
question is: Can the management be im-
proved so that profits will result? It is
absurd to suppose otherwise. The business
may perhaps be unable to pay dividends on
watered capital; but on the capital actually
in it and wisely invested, there should be a
fair return. Old W. E. Smith made it pay
all right. No doubt he had his own peculiar
methods. But if this co. is not prepared
to adopt them, too, it has the advantage,
which lie didn't possess, of having a share
connection which certainly would bring
business if this co. could offer samples and
in-ices even approximately as good as other
firms. If the co. doesn’t pay it is almo t
certainly due to bad management. The
directors- —who are capable men, but without
any special knowledge at all of this business
—apparently realise that something is
wrong, and they have experimentally set up
two new lieiids in place of a general man-
ager : there is now a “managing secretary”
and a trade manager. There is no inherent
reason why this scheme should fail.
The directors propose further to clean up
the balance-sheet by writing down capital
to represent unrealisable items. In addition
to the intangible £10,569 shown in the table,
there is £3561 of capital represented by
leasehold, and probably another £lOOO by
fixtures, etc., in these leasehold premises.
The capital will therefore probably be
reduced to £60,000. This will relieve the
co. of the present burden of providing every
half-year for depreciation of these fixtures,
amortising the leasehold, and writing down
the goodwill. Say £5OO a half- year will be
thus available for distribution —if the co.
can make it. And of course the co. should
make that and a great deal more, though, on
the other hand, this is not the sort of busi-
ness from which dazzling results may reason-
ably _be expected. There is too much com-
petition for that —especially the competition
ot the little printer-man who works in his
own shop any hours he likes, and would in
most cases rather take a job to return him
only a shilling an hour than be idle
altogether.

And that the big additions to reserves have
been something more than a bookkeeping
expansion you, can tell from this: —

Liquid assets.. ..£16,854 £38,134
Other assets . . . . 22,288 31,873
Liabilities . . . , 74 Nil
So in 10 years, after paying out the dm,
running from 8 up to 30 p.c., the co. has
added £21,354 to its liquid assets (mostly
public securities), and put another £9500
or so to the non-liquid assets. And there
has been no writing-up of these latter. The
co.’s premises, for instance, stand in the
books at the same price now as they did 10
years ago, though they are certainly worth
more. Not, of course, that they should
therefore have been written up: on the con-
trary, since the building must be replaced
some day, no matter how the value of the
freehold may grow, a replacement fund
ought to be provided out of written-off
profits. Still that is a small matter. The
larger facts as to this co. are that in 10
years it has paid its big dividend and put
by an amount one-fifth larger than its entire
capital, and that the assets representing
capital and reserves are sound, so far as
one can see, and one can see most of the way.
Also the trustee business is one which is
almost bound to expand out of all proportion
to the expansion of the country, while the
business in hand or -practically assured will
carry the co. over some years, and will be
comparatively little affected by the gloomy
time which is ahead of Victoria.

How the German cavalry has fallen to
pieces! A dozen years ago A. G. Hales,
writing up the German army reviews, noted
as a fatal defect the cavalryman’s inability
to “nurse” his horse. Apparently Hales,
who looked at these things with the eye of
an Australian busliman, was not far wrong.
Nordhausen. the birthplace of Lody, who
was recently shot in London as a spy. has
decided to honor his memory by planting an
oak. Maybe Nordhausen realises what hor-
rors German sculptures are, and chose an
oak instead. On the other hand, it may
simply have learned that bronze in the
Fatherland has risen to £l6O a ton.
Mary Gaunt, whose “Woman in China” is
going to be the most-read travel book of the
year, has three brothers making themselves
unpleasant to strangers. One is the second
Australian to achieve rear-admiral’s rank;
another is a commodore; a third is at the
front as Captain of Dragoon Guards. Two
other brothers, following their father, the
late County Court Judge of Victoria, are
barristers. The Argus, by the way, always
refers to the venturesome daughter of the
regiment as Mrs. Mary Gaunt, whereas her
married name is Miller.
General von Emmieli, who lately allowed
himself to be interviewed by a U.S. journal-
ist, assured the U.S. journalist—we have
the U.S. journalist’s word for it —that the
English are excellent fighters. The mild
story doesn’t sound incredible. It was this
von Emmieli to whom the heroic Belgian
General Leman tendered his sword after the
Liege forts had been pounded to pieces;
whereupon the stocky victor bent in the
middle and refused the ironmongery, with
the remark that it had been an honor to
cross swords with so brave a man. Alto-
gether von Emmieli seems to be trying to win
the reputation of being the best-mannered
Hun in Europe. He has few competitors.
The assumption that the typical Aus-
tralian of the future will more or less
resemble the generic aboriginal, even as the
American is reverting to the Red Indian,
gets little confirmation from figures which
Statistician Ivnibbs lately arrived at after
examining the papers of over 120,000
trainees. Of the whole lot 47.5 per cent,
wore brown hair, 27.5 per cent, fair hair,
19 per cent, black or blackish, and 6 per-
cent. were ginger. Forty-two and a half
per cent, used blue eyes, 29 per cent, brown,
19.5 grey and 9 per cent, what “Ouida”
would call amber. In combinations fair
hair and blue eyes accounted for 15.5 per-
cent., brown hair and blue eyes 19 per cent.,
brown hair and brown eyes 15 per cent., black
hair and brown eyes 9 per cent., and brown
hair and grey eyes 9 per cent. There isn’t
much reversion to Binglii about that lot.
Dear B., —I see by the London papers that
the British officers and men have arranged
a series of inter-trench football matches;
also that a pack of fox-hounds has been
brought over from England, while guns are
being freely bought wherewith to shoot the
pheasants which abound in the mangel-
wurzel patches. I hope to proceed to the
front myself in the spring, and being a keen
sportsman, I should be glad of a few tips.
Should I wear the pink coat and buttons of
my local hunt club, or would it be in better
taste if—being in a ‘ foreign country—l
turned out in a plain dark coat and bowler?
Are the Flanders pheasants driven, or does
one walk them up? In the latter case what
about dogs? Should I bring them or would
it be cheaper to get them on the Continent?
Also what facilities are provided for keeping
sporting dogs in the trenches? I have often
heard of the Rhine salmon, and have fasted
that most horrible of savories, Rhine lax.
What is the salmon-fishing like on the
Dusseldorf-Cologne-Frankfort line, which is
where our armies are to break through, ulti-
mately, I understand? Are Australian flies
any good for the Rhine, and. if not, are flies
classed as loot under the Hague agreement
if forcibly seized from a Cologne trader who
has no further use for them? What do
they charge for the best Stadium seats at
Brussels, Liege. Dusseldorf, Magdeburg and
Berlin —this being the route I propose to
follow? And do the promoters make any
reduction for soldiers in uniform? Do the
German girls—but perhaps I have asked
enough for the present. Awaiting an early
reply.—Yours eagerly, Call an Park.
From London :
Passed out. Lady Sherbrooke, second wife of the
“Bobby” Lowe who was a conspicuous figure in
Sydney in the ’4o's, She was Miss Caroline Sneyd
when she became his secretary and amanuensis, and
she made herself so useful in those capacities that
■ Bobby resolved to secure her services for the . re-
mainder of his stay on earth. The lady promptly
elicited uncomplimentary remarks by the misdirected
energy with which she trotted her blind and septu-
agenarian husband around London social functions
and festivities. She wasn’t going to hide her light
as Lady Sherbrooke under a bushel! The killing of
a favorite nephew in action caused a shock that
proved fatal. Her death has evoked many reminis-
cences of the brilliant, eloquent and irascible Bob,
the most interesting of them contributed to the Pall
Mall Gazette by J. F. Hogan, another ex-Aus-
tralian who rose to some eminence in the Commons,
and who wrote a book on Lowe’s Australian career.
“Gunner”: An impromptu demonstration
of the effects of lyddite occurred at an ammu-
nition factory in Yorkshire recently, and
advertised tlie ghastly possibilities of this
death-dealer if it could only be dumped in
bulk on to an enemy. One of three maga-
zines in which the high-explosive shells were
stored blew up. and this was the extent of
tlie casualty list: Killed, 7; injured, 20
(there were only 30 workmen about at the
time) ; factory wrecked; two large iron
beams burled 800yds.; every window within
a mile shattered; and a bole left in the
ground big enough to bury tlie Past. _ The
men who manufacture lyddite practically
live in the firing-line. The shell consists of
a forged-steel case into which melted picric
acid is poured ; and all sorts of precautions
have to be taken to prevent the acid com-
bining with lead, soda and other materials
which would produce sensitive picrates and
disaster. With the increased protection
given to troops in the field, the lyddite shell
has become less used, but it is still the most
deadly thing that can be hurled against an
army in the open or behind light conceal-
ments.
“Hon. lieggie": “Fruit for the Masses I”
shouts Sydney Telegraph, like a benevolent
earl distributing relief at the village soup
kitchen. In Heaven’s name, who are the
(’lasses in this democracy of ours that don’t
want reasonably cheap fruit? 1 know several
amiable lady readers of the Telegraph who
would cut me dead for ever if I dared to
suggest that then belonged to the Masses.
And yet they are clamoring for cheap fruit
just as loudly as their washerladies. who, in
their turn, reckon themselves some Class.
When Austria has been beaten fiat, Ger-
many may find a last use for the remains by
making them carry the blame for the whole
catalogue of atrocities. Ellis Barker, in the
Nineteenth Century, writes : “Austria has
always ruled with barbaric methods. The
atrocious acts of which Germany has been
guilty in Belgium and France were taught
by Austria.” And lie asserts that, before
leaving London, Prince Lielmowsky, referring
to poor old Franz Joseph’s country, said to
a friend: “Germany goes to war with a
corpse hanging round her neck.” Since then
it has added Turkey to the necklace. For
companions William has now therefore the
Sick and the Dead.
One horrible feature of the present war
is that the fighting follows the lines of
densest population. According to I)r. Bar-
tholomew’s map the country is thicker with
people along three-fourths of the French
battle front than anywhere else in France
except in the immediate environs of Paris
and Lyons. All the Belgian fighting has been
in districts containing in normal times more
than 500 people to the square mile. Again,
the Russian battles, with the exception of
those in East Prussia, which is rather
a thin and hungry land, have raged where
homes are most numerous. Near Lodz and
from that city north and south to the Polish
frontier the population is as thick as in
Devonshire and Sussex, and it is the srtme
east and west of Lemberg; while for a hun-
dred miles or thereabout east of Cracow and
in practically the whole of the province of
Bukovina there are more people to the square
mile than in any county of England outside
the great industrial areas. Even the Servian
section of the scrap has been fought in that
portion of the Balkan Peninsula where men
and women and little children, not to men-
tion pigs, are more plentiful than elsewhere
except at Bucharest and within 20 miles <>f
Constantinople. Nowhere in the wesrern
half of Ireland is the population as dense as
at the most thinly-peopled parts of any of
the European battle-fronts.
“Coot”: The case of William Ebenezer
Reed, a modern Enoch Arden (B. 14/1/T5).
reminds me of Charles Hamilton, who died
intestate at Windsor (Vic.) in 1898. _ A
Trustee Co. obtained letters to administer
Jus estate, on the motion of the dead man’s
brother. When the co. came to investigate
regarding the next of kin it discovered that
Hamilton’s wife had deserted him some 15
years before, and had disappeared. After
advertising, it obtained an order of the
Court presuming her to have predeceased
her husband. Thereupon the estate was cut
up between Hamilton’s brothers, sisters,
nephews and nieces. Six years later the
officially-deceased lady turned up and
demanded her share of the estate of the dear
departed. The co. of course simply showed
her the Court’s assertion that she was a
corpse. As it happened, the last of Hamil-
ton’s nephews just about that time attained
the age of 21, and, being a sport, he directed
that his share of the estate should be paid
to his mucli-alive (and recently-married)
aunt. That ended the bother.
“Cathopresbycongreganglitist” : A contro-
versy has arisen, “When Christians fight, are
they Christians?” It is a tough problem.
A foundation plank of the Christian platform
lays it down that if you are smitten on the
right whisker it is your duty to turn your
left to the smiter. Clearly the candidate
who doesn’t do this is not entitled to his
diploma as a Christian. On the other hand,
the man who in time of pressing trouble
doesn’t put up a scrap isn’t a Christian either
for long—lie is a corpse. So the only way to
be a Christian would seem to be to go into a
lonely desert where there is nothing to
quarrel with you. and smite yourself alter-
nately on the right jaw and the left in a
mild kind of way that won’t make you dislike
yourself enough to retaliate. That is how
ancient hermits solved the problem, and it
is about the only way it can be solved.
“10-2-4” : The master-characteristic of the
German since the war began is an optimism
bordering on insanity. In October and
November they were all satisfied that the
Kaiser would be in Paris by Christmas.
Two months ago General Liman von San-
ders, chief of the German mission to Turkey,
told the Hungarian paper, Pesti Hirlap,
that the Russians couldn’t hold out much
longer and France already had had enough.
About the same time an intelligent German
business man got into difficulties in London
over liis hotel bill. He had never been in
arrears before, and put down his embarrass-
ment to the war. Jn a month, lie said, lie
would be able to pay. The magistrate asked
why. and the bland answer was that, by that
time Germany would be in the courtyard of
the Bank of England. Do they believe all
this bellowdrama, or is the whole nation
skiting absurdly to keep its courage up?
“0.K.” : British patriotism screams for the
“capture of German trade” as the most prac-
tical means of bursting up the German dream
of World Conquest.; and all the while Aus-
tralian supper parties eat and drink an revoir
to Australian soldiers at the restaurants of
guttural aliens, who mutter “Germany must
vin in der long r-run.” Inoffensive German
workers at the wharves and elsewhere are
boycotted by their former mates, whilst
offensive German employers of German vait-
ers are fattening on the patronage of luxuri-
ous Australian feeders. These people woulc.
patronise all-Australian fooderies if they
were tempted ; but nobody makes a patriotic-
appeal to their stummicks. They trade with
the enemy at the restaurants for ' the same
reason that they buy their oysters and fruit
from a Dago and their vegetables from a
Chow. Australians are the least patriotic
people in the world as regards their food
purchases, because they have never troubled
to think about the matter, and nobody has re-
minded them in a business-like manner ot
their foolish indifference,

I heard a young mother talking to
her little son about his teeth, telling him
how important it is that the teeth be kept clean.
•'lf you want to be a big, strong boy,” she said, “and then a big, strong man, you
must have good teeth. And, to keep your teeth sound you must remember now
while you are a little boy, to brush them twice every day.” The young mother told
me that the youngster liked the taste of the Ribbon Dental Cream, and that this
had helped her in inducing him to form the important daily habit. Of course,
she talked with him about it now and then to impress on him the great advantage
to his health and comfort that comes with this daily care. “Then twice a«year,
she added, “I have the dentist look him over.

IN BANANA LAND
“Acorn” : The Australian doesn’t have 'to
import everything. Organs, for instance.
Recently, the Brisbane City Tabernacle de-
sired one of these instruments, and in a
burst of patriotism, turned the foreigner
down. In some doubt, the job was given to
a local firm, and the result, in volume of
s.ound and quality of tone, has cut the
ground from under the importing maniac’s
hoofs.
Gilbert White, the Bishop of Carpentaria,
just chosen to be Bishop of Willochra, in
S. Australia, leaves the quaintest “cathe-
dral” in the Commonwealth—and one of the
quaintest anywhere. It is at Thursday
Island, and, like all other buildings at
“Thirsty,” is of wood and iron. The
“windows” are French doors, so that the
place can be the better thrown open to the
evening breeze. The building was put up as
a memorial to those who were drowned in
the Quetta disaster, and all about the walls
are the coral-encrusted copper parts of port-
holes and other relics of the wreck.
“Manx”: “Queenslander” says (B.
28/1/T5) that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment has made a mess of oil prospecting in
Papua, and remarks that “a boring plant in
Queensland is expected to average 3000 ft.
a year.” Will it interest “Queenslander”
to know that with many oilrigs in America
300 ft. has been drilled in a day? One
recent Oklahoma tally was 2119 ft. in three
weeks. The Australian has never drilled
for _ oil, and he shouldn’t be asked to try
until an American rig with an American
crew has given him a demonstration. What
were Dr. Wade’s qualifications, anyhow?
He is an English chemist and geologist, but
on what oilfield did he gain experience as
an oil-well engineer? When he recommended
and installed on the Government oil lands
of Papua a slow and. inefficient rotary sys-
tem of boring, instead of the rapid and
effectual jumper drill, he at once raised
doubts about his knowledge of petroleum
mining. If the Commonwealth has “made a
mess of oil prospecting in Papua” the mess
is due to its first error of engaging an Eng-
lish geologist and not an American drill
man.
AFTER THE FIRE.
SMALL BOY ( who has been poking among the ruins): “ Hey , Missus, I've found the
key of yer door."
From a Courier article of 50 years ago:
i No one who walks the streets with his eyes open
can be insensible to the increase of immorality
that is evidenced on every hand. Lais and Aspasia
flaunt brazen in all our public places.
Strange that when we are 60 the world is
always wickeder than it was when we were
25!
Affluent Arnold Weinholt, ex-member for
Fassifern in the Assembly, has a passion for
big game. He resigned his seat in the State
House to fight Andrew Fisher in the Wide
Bay electorate. Trampled flat there he went
to Africa to pursue his hobby, and has come
back, crippled from a mawling by a lion. A
man who is so unfortunate with lions should
stick to the insect life of State politics.
The Bananaland brand of Binghi showed
to advantage the other day. At a pub out
towards Sundown, a “wanted” man held the
bar with a loaded rifle while the publican
obediently and without argument handed
out free poison to a full house. The im-
promptu and honorary bushranger promised
a supply of lead to the first man who
showed trouble. Everyone took his word
for it except Binghi. Watching his oppor-
tunity our sun-burnt brother grabbed the
gun, shot the hon. bushranger dead, and
then turned and ran as if 10 flaming devils
had been loosed on him. He hasn’t returned
yet.
During last session the Assembly passed
400 miles of railway—about 2 i million
pounds worth. The bulk of this won’t earn
grease for many years, but the Commis-
sioner is expected to make the lines com-
mercially successful all the same. He must
make the railways pay, but keep down fares
and freight. He must provide interest on
capital, and yet build lines of which he dis-
approves. He must push out suburban lines
and yet do nothing to interfere with Badger’s
trams. And if he can’t run political lines
on commercial principles, he is a fraud and
they want to kick him out.
The Ruins of Baalbek.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not in our stones is our full story told,
Grey in the twilight’s pall, gold in the gold
Of the pure washings of the Syrian suns
Where from our feet green-sown El Bekaa
runs. '
Baal was our god, and Helios, and here
The pale Christ kept his Godhead many a
year
Until the Arab sheik, the hawk-eyed man,
Steered through the shifting sands a caravan,
And with the cunning born of need and
stress
Fashioned a fortress of our mightiness.
Here where Diana ! shone in silver dress
Above some leaf-crowned, splendid naked-
ness,
Bacchus leapt through in pining revelry
And swung the large-limbed woman at his
knee.
This door was Jupiter’s. And yet again
The white moon lifts above the shadowy
plain,
But the great gods are gone. An Emperor
came.
They scrawled a mural tablet with his name,
Man’s memory on man’s memory to impress,
Where gods have gone to long forgetfulness.
Our courts are strewn with columns. Deep
and cool
Were the still waters in the hallowed pool
That cleansed the victim for the sacrifice.
Fate tossed once more. The Christian held
the dice.
He built a church above the altar stains.
The church is gone, The empty pool
remains.
Carved in the clusters of a woven vine
Blown poppies ’mid the fruits' and wheat-
■ ears twine:
Fauns and bacchantes leer from giant doors!
And sly grey lizards snort in broken floors.
And sometimes like a dream of' summer trees
Comes the thick whispering of sun-drunk
bees.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, February 6, 1915.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The Osterley took a host of Queens-
landers southward, a good many of them
being from the Darling Downs. Mrs. Alex.
McPhie (a Toowoomba matron), Mr. and
Mrs. Charlie Lethbridge (the latest Too-
woomba wedded pair) and Mr. and Mrs.
Macaulay Turner (also newly-wed) were
among the ship’s congregation.
Mrs. A. H. Barlow and her portfolioed
husband have just returned from Tasmania,
where they helped themselves to a little cool
weather. Mr. Pagan, of the railways, and
his popular missus are other Queenslanders
who are revelling in Apple Island climate.
Beatrice Marshall, elder daughter of the
Brisbane Town Clerk, died this week.
To-day, with the mercury almost at frying
point, numbers of women and girls filled the
city and sold asters —bunches, basketsful,
ciumps or single blooms—for the enrichment
of the Belgian fund. The weather coridi-
tions dried up the blossoms early, but the
fountain of Brisbane’s charity kept spouting
coins till a late hour.
The National Council of Women is again
getting up steam after a lengthy pause. Its
initial exertions will be the arrangement of
an At Home in thanksgiving for the return
of the Council’s president, Mrs. Kingsbury.
She went all the way to England and the
adjacent tourist resorts.
Mrs. Knox Carson, first known in Bris-
bane as Miss Williams, a pretty English
girl who turned the heads of our best-pre-
served bachelors and finally married Knox
Carson, has had news of the death of her
brother Leo in action in Belgium at the end
of January. He visited Brisbane some years
ago and made many friends.
Mabel Brady and Betty Cockburn, two of
our best-dressed girls, rolled home by the
Osterley on Monday. Miss Brady has been
away . two years, and Miss Cockburn half
that time. They both are sporting the latest
thing in skirts—the species with the long
tunic. Miss Brady has brought, for the im-
provement of our millinery education, a
sample of the Tommy Atkins toque—a little
black velvet thing, becoming only to those
who possess regular features, and quite out
of place on a bearded lady or a person with
an up-turned nose and a double chin. Miss
Brady has none of these misfortunes. The
voyagers say that when they left England
the Tipperary cap, a jaunty thing worn over
one eye, and fluttering two little black tails
or ribbon, was being worn by women who
like to fly their patriotic colors at the mast,
so to speak.
Miss Brady went to see the artists’ corps
dulling in London, and to her intense joy
beheld the tuneful Kennerley, of the Butt
family, clad in dungarees and a sweater,
laboriously going through his martial paces.
Another Australian girl who recently re-
turned to Brisbane had an unusual piece of
excitement in John Bull’s country. She
went to inspect a big camp, and snapshotted
freely as she wandered around. Then she
got into a motor-car to go home, but two
drum-majors or rifle-rangers hurried after
her and politely but firmly led her to the
commandant. He finally “warned” her and
let her go, which shows the luck some
thoughtless people havd.
Mollie Ferrier and Julian Mackay (of
Giro station, N.S.W.) murmured the'usual
“I wills” on Wednesday afternoon at St.
John’s Cathedral. The church was packed,
principally with the bride’s school friends.
They rolled up almost to a girl. The four
bridesmaids—Miss Mackay (the groom’s sis-
ter), Jean Goertz, Peggy Ferrier and the
younger Ross Munro—wore beautifully soft
dresses of shell-pink crgpe de chine and lace,
and big black hats tricked out with pink
roses.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
"Machete” : The youthful pirate who tried
to steal a Sydney launch and break for the
Islands (B. 4/2/’l5) was a poor imitation
of a trio who made a similar attempt to
get out of Brisbane two years ago and streak
for the Carolines. They stole a powerful
motor-launch, provisioned her, equipped her
with arms, ammunition and petrol (all
stolen), and got clear away to sea. They
made only one error. They forgot to steal
lubricating oil, and when they tried to make
up the deficiency with dripping from the
larder the chapter of adventures closed. They
made the Queensland coast under canvas,
and reached the lockup under escort.
“Paddy Melon”: “Wunbo” (B. 28/1/T5)
is on the right track about the official “pro-
tection” of Queensland aborigines. Last
year, at a station on the Diamantina, a
pamp of aged blacks were practically starv-
ing. It was flood time and their means of
obtaining tucker was cut off by miles and
miles of water. The manager of the station
informed the proper authority at Birdsville,
but no notice was taken. In the meantime
the station was supplying the unfortunate
blacks with tucker. The manager next
wrote to headquarters, and was curtly in-
formed that Birdsville would inquire. The
satellite at Birdsville evidently got orders
to visit the camp, for he made the trip, duly '
inspected and departed; Some time later
the station manager was informed that the
blacks at the time of the visit were in robust
health and well supplied with food, and that
belp was unnecessary. Now, I saw them on
several occasions, and there was never any-
thing in the way of food handy, except the
small ration of flour supplied by the station.
Yet this same station had to pay 10s. per
week for every boy that was employed, and
the money was supposed to be available for
the upkeep of aged blacks. As a matter
of fact, the latter get nothing in the Diaman-
tina country, except one solitary blanket
ner annum, which may cost the Government
ss.
The Licenses Reduction Board in Victoria
has finished eight year§’ work and closed 800
pubs in over-beered districts; and the com-
pensation paid has been £400,000. But it
hasn’t been paid by the Government. Under
the wise Victorian law “the Trade” has to
find the coin, on the principle that the
remaining houses score from the closing of
the others.
In the new Arbitration Bill which will be
before the N.S.W. Parliament this session
the prohibition of strikes goes overboard.
The Government has decided to give up the
struggle to qompel men to refrain from
dropping tools and wages, and to merely
provide for regulating the foolishness. The
strike prohibition in the existing Act was
a farce, anyhow. Those who wanted to
strike went on striking as cheerfully as ever,
and getting fined, and cheerfully ignoring
the. fines. Now the proposal is to recognise
strikes as things that, though evil, are in-
evitable, and to try to avoid them by pro-
viding that they shall be illegal unless
declared in a proper fashion after arbitra-
tion has failed and a secret ballot has been
taken. Hereabouts the scheme becomes
hazy. Say a strike has been declared
illegal and fines inflicted. Is there anything
in the Bill to prevent Holman, a year or so
later, explaining that the Union has paid
Is. Sd. off the penalty and that the odd
£99 Bs. 4d. has been remitted? If there
isn’t the prospects of the new prohibition
are not more encouraging than the actual
experiences of the old prohibition.

BEAUTY DOCTOR TELLS
SECRET.
A BEAUTY DOCTOR GIVES SIMPLE
RECIPE TO DARKEN GREY HAIR
AND PROMOTE ITS GROWTH.
Miss Alice Whitney, a well-known beauty
doctor, recently made the following state-
ment: “Anyone can prepare a simple mix-
ture at home, at very little cost, that will
darken grey hair, promote its growth and
make it soft and glossy. To half a pint of
water add loz. of bay rum, a small box of
Orlex Compound and loz. of glycerine.
These ingredients can be bought at any
chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to the
hair twice a week until the desired shade is
obtained. This will make a grey-liaired
person look 20 years younger. It is also fine
to promote the growth of the hair, relieve
itching and scalp troubles, and is excellent
for dandruff and falling hair.”* [lO

What the whole Empire
uses for all forms of
KIDNEY TROUBLE.
Just a little exposure to cold or damp and
you have got a pain in the back. Agony to
bend or move in any way, bad headache, puffi-
ness under the eyes, these mean for certain
that you have kidney trouble. Then you
should look out for deadly Bright’s disease,
which creeps on unawares.
It is positively dangerous to trifle or play
with the most simple form of kidney disease.
The moment any symptoms of kidney
trouble are detected a very simple and sure
remedy should be tried Without delay.
What the Boers and other nations use
for Pains in different parts of the body.
You should use one which millions of people
are using throughout the wide world —one
which English sufferers have faith in, and so
have Scotch, Irish and Welsh people. Not
only these, the people in New Zealand, West
Africa, China and India, in their millions,
swear by it.
The people of Holland, the Belgian, the
Frenchman, yes, and the German, too, all
know that it is the only one certain remedy
for kidney trouble. Canada’s and America’s
millions use and recommend it daily, and now
in Australia the sale is growing enormously—
the sure remedy they arfe all using is De
AVitt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
Why are all these millions of people using
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills?
Because they have proved by experience
that these Wonderful little pills are really
life-savers.
If tliey are so good, if these multitudes of
people in every corner of the world are using
them with such great success, do you not think

irritability, aches and pains in the muscles or
joints, puffiness under the eyes, or bad head-
ache, you certainly need De Witt’s Kidney and
Bladder Pills.
Or if you suffer from backache, rheumatism,
gout, sciatica, lumbago, stone, gravel or pains
in the bladder, muscles and joints, you . are
foolish to yourself if you do not commence to
use these little wonder-workers immediately.
Many remedies claim to cure, and do, with-
out doubt, give relief for a time, but the one
remedy which will give you quick relief, and
most probably a permanent cure, is De Witt’s
Kidney and Bladder Pills, for when once
cured by these wonderful little pills our
readers say they are cured for ever.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills can be
obtained at any of the branches of Washing-
ton H. Soul, Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Sydney;
Longmore’s, The Melbourne Pharmacy, Bourke
Street, Melbourne; and all leading chemists
at 2/9 and 5/6 per large box. The 5/6 size is
two and a half times as large as the 2/9 size,
and contains enough doses to last you three
weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind you
must positively get rid of the cause—the
poisonous Uric Acid. Remember, to do this,
a real remedy must pass through the kidneys
and the bladder, and not through the bowels
as most Kidney Pills do. When you see the
urine change to a muddy, bluish color —a fea-
ture which distinguishes De Witt’s Pills from
all others —you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right spot
—the kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful
pill—straight to the kidneys—that is. the
reason why De Witt’s give such amazingly
quick relief every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every cafe. Look for that
blue color.

taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
A.L.K.: Can’t see why you should get so
excited in defence of that particular German. Your
name is Irish. The name of the street you live in
is specially English. The name of the suburb you
live in is Scotch. And your writing is bad enough
to be Hebrew.... B 2: General French is Irish, like
all the other English generals except those who are
Scotch.... Thomas Matthews: (1) His name was
Saladin, not Suludin; (2) he was not a Turk ; (3)
the Templars could never have got together 30,000
children of different nationalities.... Core Box:
Would like to put your case for an increased duty
on malleable iron castings (n.e.i.) for the encourage-
ment of the industry, but your explanation is hardly
tangible Bobs: Can’t see why women shouldn’t
take the woodwork course. .. .Knockala: He’s not
worth powder... .J.L. (V.): Your poem, “Stripped
to the Skin,” isn’t nearly as good as its title....
E.II. (N.S.W.) : You are too diffident and exact ever to
be a poet... .Robert McN.: Oh, do cheer up !Ifhe is a
complete lunatic, he may be quite cheerful and con-
tented. All his life he has been trying to make the
World take him seriously. Now he has succeeded....
M. : Your touch isn’t strong enough. The exe-
cution morning has been scribbled over by many
pens... .Paddy-M.: Verses just get along and that’s
all. .. .Bongy: No use to u5....A. McG.: The truth
can be very dull at times.... Boobyalla: Been dead
too long. The essay starts off like a king’s funeral
procession, but is soon plodding along the old route
....Valjean: Some subjects are permanently
out of bounds. You have struck one of them....
11. H.: Amateurish variation of “Me Undt Gott.”
Theme worked 0ut.... John C.: No echo of ceaseless
strife in your verse, which only suggests curates
passing afternoon tea... . Blenkins: Why worry over
verse for us when you are “dead gone on a girl in
the Mallee” ?.... Emo: Poem is gone in the knees.
Also it now has a broken neck.... Miss It.H.: Why
didn’t you tell us more about the eager young man
who made love on the upper deck?... .R.V.C.: “Four
gentlemen are leaning back in the big lounge chairs
of the smoking-room of the Bachelors’ Club.” Too
many gentlemen. Have you a story with plain men
in it ?.... Bellerive: It looks like a German victory,
but we’ll chance it:—
.... W.8.H.: Gadgett gets too near Ade’s Fables....
A.A.D.: Confused sort of thing..M.E. (M.L.) : Too
obvious—you can see the joke coming.. . .8.M.H.:
Roughly handled.... Chris R.: No use trying to
rhyme “game” and “rain.” It simply can’t be
done. ... A.H.S.: Sorry unsuitable... .A.M.: Verses
don’t grip. .. .F.A.: (S.A.) : It’s hard to say any-
thing new about the Unspeakable Gerhog Mrs.
N. : Idea all right, but you lack the necessary
skill... .H.S.C.H.: You might place the sketches
elsewhere. But don’t you know that unsigned manu-
scripts without an address are about as valuable as
Unsigned cheques with no date or amount filled
in?,... .C.F. (M.L.): Just as he bent over
and murmured in “her Heaven-formed ear,” the
knock-off whistle blew and we all put on our
coats... .Rene M.: If you are only 17 and desire to
take up literature as a profession, you had better
apprentice yourself to Marie Corelli. In ease you
don’t make good at literature, it would be wise to
take up an additional subject. We recollect another
young lady of Sydney who “took up” Shakspeare and
step-dancing. How about literature and washing?
....Hugh S.: Extra-mild war verse... .J.L.: Two
lines:—
But with all the fuss made by men so skilled,
’Tis a devil of a job to get oneself killed.
....Moonstruck: It is merely threatened with inter-
est....S.H. (M.L.): Thanks for clipping. Never
hear of the Manawatu Daily Times. Is it an ele-
phant?. .. .AV.S.; You say, it is the best joke of the
century; why didn’t you forward it? F. J.C.: Get
the personal note.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Woomelang: Give it to your dearest enemy....
G.W.C.8.: Flat and tinny.. ..G.H.S.: Nothing use-
able. .. .E.H.: Drawing faulty and idea late....
Woodicus: You are an artistic-nightmare factory....
W.R.P.: Why does your German professor wear a
burst pudding instead of hair?.... J.H.F.: Pointless
remark written on the back of a useless chart....
Wat C.R.: Raw art... .F.R.K. • Drawing is poor and
has a libellous 100 k.... Clio N.C.: Not good enough
and the world hardly knows him .... W.F.F.: Are
you trying to be intelligently blasphemous? It’s
Stone Age art and quite hopeless,.. .McF.: Your
British lion looks as if it had been knitted by a blind
old maid... .R.R.E.: You’ve got some ideas, but you
need training... .Frank S.: Kaiser-monkey design
has a soupy appearance. Other is very muddy, and
tt|e gag made the lady who empties the basket burst
into tears... .John C. (N.S.W.) : Quaint idea. But
in the working-out of ideas you’ve got everything to
learn... .A.T.N.: Petrified fragment... .Allan C.:
Impossible both ways A.G. (JHelb.): Adam and
the goat will pass, but Eve is the wrong shape.
William O’Halloran, one of the oldest
natives of Tasmania, born in Launceston
in 1844, has just died. lie was son of a
soldier —in his early days the British soldier
was in charge in Tasmania. Having laid
down his arms Mick became landlord of the
Crown Hotel, 3 i Launceston, where his son
William was born. In the long ago there
were railway riots in Launceston, and it
was then that W. OTlalloran joined the
Police Force. He wore the uniform for
40 years, and was then given a job in the
Post Office, where he remained till he was
70. .One of his dozen or so sons, a journal-
ist on the Johannesburg Star, is now fight-
ing in German South Africa.
AT THE COHNER.
A fierce patriotic argument
Ensued the other night
Between a Britain and a german
Which ended in a fight.
Onward in'the distance waned
A policeman on his beat,
When they posed for fistic combat
At the corner of our street.
They struck pugilistic attitudes
And struggled to hit out
But were too intoxicated
To put up a good bout.
An excited crowd did cluster round
And did wildly shriek and hurray
When the german’s gallant Mrs.
Did wade into the fray.
Armed with an umbrella
She slashed her poor dead, Beat
To the joy of the spectators
At thb corner of our street.

AN/EMIA
and Debility
IF you are run-down, easily exhausted and out
* of breath—if you feel slack, depressed, or
“out-of-sorts,” start a Course of Iron
‘Jelloids’ at once. Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ are the
finest and most reliable tonic for all cases of
Anaemia or Debility. They quickly restore
vitality, and produce the rich healthy blood so
essential to good health and vigour. Iron
‘Jelloids’ are a perfectly safe remedy under
all conditions —pleasant, inexpensive, do not
harm the teeth, and are non-constipating.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote:—
“It can be definitely stated that Iron ‘Jelloids’
constitute the most effective and desirable
treatment for the cure of that common com-
plaint, that insidious and weakening condition,
no matter from what cause arising, known
as Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”
A fortnight’s trial (Price 1/6) will convince you
Iron Jelloids'
enrich the blood - renew vitality

A SENSE of satisfaction is experienced
every time one wears a pair of Bos-
tock boots, and from this consciousness
of their fine quality springs a natural and
legitimate pride. One feels that they will
contribute to ease and elegance on the most
exacting occasions, and one knows that their
high quality will be recognised every time
they are handled. This sense of satisfaction
is the inevitable effect of the choice leather
and beautiful work so conspicuous in every
pair of Bostocks. They are the cream of
imported boots.
Special shipments have recently arrived at the
leading stores, and ladies should call before the

The Sydney newsboys’ strike, or lockout,
recalls that systematic selling of newspapers
in the street is not a very old institution.
Lionel Brough, of the acting family, claimed
that he was the first to arrange for street
selling. That was when he was on the
business staff of one of the London dailies,
about the middle of the nineteenth century.
The Amalgamated Press, Limited, which
is the official business style of the Hanns-
worth family and its cronies, has been hold-
ing its annnal meeting in London. Profits,
£329,272 14s. 8d. The usual dividend is to
be paid “at a time when so many cos. have
declared no dividend at all. The directors
are not afraid of the war.” They didn’t have
to worry about paper supplies, having
established their own mills in Newfoundland,
thereby securing “enormous supplies of the
raw material which our business requires
for the production of its many journals.”

Says a cable: “Gladys Cooper, the well-
known actress, has been awarded £1250
for libel by innuendo, without mentioning
names.” There is also the libel, which men-
tions a name without intending the person.
The classic instance is the case of Artemus
Jones. The Paris correspondent of the Sun-
day Chronicle furnished a fanciful account
of a motor festival at Dieppe:—
Upon the terrace marches the world, attracted by
the motor races. Whist! there goes Artemus Jones
with a woman who is not his wife.
There was a real Artemus Jones. lie was
a barrister practising on the North Wales
circuit. Moreover, by an ungodly combina-
tion of circumstances lie was at Dieppe. He
was then unknown, but the case which
resulted has made him immortal, for it went
right on to the House of Lords, and the
paper had to pay £1750 damages and all the
costs.

“Hoe”: The story of the “Ilarmsworth
enterprise” (B. 21/1/T5), in securing the
sole English-language rights of the historic
French “Yellow Book” had a sequel. When
the Times charged 2s. for the translation
(despite the fact that none of the other
publications in the rainbow series cost more
than 44d., and the British “White Book” was
socialistically published at Id.), several
French newspapers wrathfully pointed out
that the prohibitive price was limiting the
circulation of the book, and thus the French
case would be almost lost to the public. On
that the British Foreign Office took the copy-
right by the horns and published a new
translation at Id. Three days after the
socialistic penny production had smashed its
monopoly, The Times, instead of taking the
Foreign Office to law for infringement of
copyright, issued the French “Yellow Book”
as a free supplement to its ordinary issue!
The only people who didn’t enjoy the comedy
were those who had indulged in two bobs’
worth of Private Enterprise.
“P.D.V.”: Considering how very modest it
is, the S. Aus. country press has provided
Parliament with an * a ordinary number
of recent members. No doubt the biggest
man ever to pass out of a little country
raggery to Parliament was Fred Holder,
who ran the Burra Record, and was the
first and greatest Speaker of the Common-
wealth Parliament. Jake Solomon, another
ex-Premier, ran the Northern Territory
Times. Of present men J. A. Southwood,
who can be as unpleasant to his opponents
as anybody in the Labor party since E. A.
Roberts’s day, is editor of the Kadina Plain
Dealer. The lately-deceased Roberts, by
the way, had also some press experience,
but wasn’t brought up to that job. Craw-
ford Vaughan is a former editor of Adelaide
Quiz. William J. Denny edited the
Southern Cross. James Hutchison was
editor of the Weekly Herald. James V.
O’Loghlen, besides running the R.C. paper,
also owned a now-defunct organ at River-
ton. Ephraim II. Coombe ran the Gawler
Bunyip. Willie Ponder was connected with
the Ivapunda Herald. W. J. C. Cole was
editor of the Laura Standard. Donald
Campbell had the Times, at Millicent.
Ash, one of the brilliant men Kingston
took under his law-wing, was also
a Sou’-eastern journalist before he took to
law and politics by way of a libel action.

“Trotter”: Reuter’s Co. has just had its
50th birthday, but Julius Reuter had been
boring away for 14 years previously. He
came from Cassel to London with little
money, but the great idea of getting news
quickly and scattering it among subscribers
—pure, naked news, with no opinions. His
first great startler was when he published the
speech of Napoleon III. to the Austrian
ambassador, foreshadowing the war of ’59.
After that he kept toppling success on suc-
cess, as Blowitz did afterwards ; and his com-
pany soon became the representative English
news agency. For this foreigner stuck close
to England, with a sure instinct that she was
on top. Queen Victoria, with her plain
nous, soon noted the co.’s promptitude and
accuracy, and the best help it ever got was
when she ordered that every important
message must be telegraphed at once to Wind-
sor, Balmoral, Osborne or wherever she might
be. Even at this day, when there are many
other fine agencies, it is very often a winner.
Thus its telegram about the capture of
Mafeking reached London before Roberts
knew it in South Africa, and his first infor-
mation was in a telegram conveying Reuter’s
information from London. Altogether there
are 1200 shareholders now on the register of
the co., of whom all but 20 are English.
Years ago Reuter was responsible for much
of the foreign news sent to Australia; but
when the city dailies formed the Cable Syn-
dicate Reuter’s dropped out of that line. It
still, however, supplies the bulk of the coun-
try papers. Before it came on the scene the
Buckinbong Argus used to collar what little
of the Syndicate’s cables it wanted. Reuter
bought from the Syndicate the right to the
cabies in districts where there is no paper
owned by a member of the Syndicate, and for
a few shillings a week the Buckingbong
Argus can now buy from Reuter the right
to the cables, and, moreover, can have them
delivered at the door. And that’s how the
old sign, “Reuter’s Telegram,” is still pre-
served in Australia.

For Health and Beauty
USE REXONA SOAP.
Miss Stephanie DaJe, the charming young actress and poetess, who has made such
a host of friends in Australia, and received ao much favorable comment since her
arrival from New Zealand, writes as follows:
\
MISS STEPHANIE DALE.
(Prom a photo.)
I am so pleased with the benefit I
have received from the use of Rexona
and Rexona Skin and Facial Soap that
I am taking the liberty of writing you
in respect to same, for I think Rexona
Is a most excellent Remedy and Rexona
Soap is certainly a delight to use.
Never have I known a tonic for the hair
to compare with Rexona Soap, for the
results I have obtained from its use are
certainly to say the least surprising.
It makes the hair so soft and silky, and
its use has a tendency, I find, to make
the hair much more curly. After having
employed it for some months now I
note a marked benefit not only to my
hair, hut my scalp was never in better
condition, being so free from Dandruff.
I can heartily recommend Rexona
Soap also for the complexion. I would
not think of using any other Soap for
the face, it is so refreshing and delicate
for the skin.
Rexona 1 have also had occasion to
use a number of times, and as a healer
and skin remedy it is certainly unsur-
passed. I always use it for sunburn
after bathing, and its effect is quite
magical. Many of my lady friends to
whom I have recommended Rexona and
Rexona Soap have had the same experi-
ence, and it is a pleasure to recommend
them, for I know they always give
satisfaction.
Much appreciating these most excel-
lent Remedies. —Sincerely yours,
(Signed) STEPHANIE DALE.
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values
a pure and healthy skin. The longer you neglect your skin the harder it will be
to care for it. Delay may result in Eczema, Psoriasis, Ringworm, Running Sores
or some of the many and unpleasant forms that skin troubles so often assume.
Rexona the Rapid Healer, and Rexona Soa.p are sure preservatives for the health
and skin. Rexona Soap (1/- per tablet) keeps the skin soft and pure, and Rexona,
the Rapid Healer, will immediately eradicate any disease which may be apparent,
for it arouses the skin to healthy activity, so that it quickly recuperates and the
diseased skin becomes once more sound and healthy. Rexona is sold everywhere
in triangular pots at 1/G, or in larger pots, holding nearly four times the quantity,
at 3/-

The Resurrection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
swore that it was Henry, but
I That statement could not blind
Those who were present on the day
When Henry stayed behind.
Though for eight weeks had he been hid
From ancient friends and dear,
We knew, who cheered tiie parting boat,
He stayed upon the pier.
Jones waved a paper in the air,
And fixed his finger on
A cable re the splendid death
Of one named Robinson.
“Old Henry, boys; Died at the front!
He’s hardly gone away,
And here, lie’s killed upon the spot!
The foremost in the fray !”
We filled and drank a silent toast;
But e’er the drinks were gone.
“Of course ,” said Smithers, basely, “it
Is not our Robinson !”
Then Brown, with anger in his eye,
The last lone drop consumed :
“That is a base remark that moves
My British blood !” he fumed.
“Well,” Binks remarked, “it’s my idea —
I may say tint I know —
That it can not be Robinson,
For Henry did not go!”
Then Jones said, in stern, bitter tones,
Unto the breathless ring
That he would not stand by and hear
Of Treason to the King !
A moment Blithers stayed the storm —
(A tactful man was he)
With words that all were glad to hear —-
“Well, what’s it going to be?”
Still, as a flood, a moment stemmed,
Breaks bounds and straight is gone,
Commenced again the loud debate
About our Robinson.
And some declared it must be he
Who had been basely shot,
And others grimly sucked their beer
And snorted, “Tommyrot!”
They scoffed at Henry’s heart and pluck,
Till Jones in anger said
He was a cad who said such things
Of the heroic dead.
The argument grew worse and worse,
Till ev’ry man saw red ;
Each faction sneering drew apart
And cut the other dead.
’Twas Smithers struck the fatal blow;
He said that it was more
Than one of British blood could stand,
And smote Binks on the jaw.
The crowd became a mingled heap,
And as we tore and fought
Each man who came into the bar
Was in the whirlwind caught.
The barmaid shrieked as glasses fell,
But still the fight went on,
Till from the mangled heap emerged
Our Henry Robinson ! ! !
And those who’d said that he was dead,
And those w 7 ho’d shouted “ Rot!”
Broke into cheers and made of him
A hero on the spot.
I don’t know why we cheered him so,
Led by the sceptic Binks.
Unless it was that Robinson
Was paying for the drinks.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u A NYBODY lost a dorg?” inquired Mr.
Maunder, holding up a small, round
metal disc. “’Cos I found this ’ere
a minute or two ago at the corner o’ Silver-
street. ‘Society Doin’s’ ’Oliday Club ; num-
ber one ’undered an’ forty-five.’”
Mr. Sharp glanced up from his paper.
“Society Doin’s, eh? That’s a rum go,
Jerry. I was jest readin’ 1 the rag w’en you
come in. Let’s see if I carn’t find nothink
about a ’Oliday Club. Oh, ere it is ! ‘Anyone
desirous o’ becomin’ a member of our ’Oliday
Club should send every week a postal note or
stamps fer one shillin’ to this orfice, on re-
ceipt o’ which a badge o’ membership, bearin’
a distinctive number, will be forwarded to ’is
address. The editor will announce every week
in the columns o’ Society Doin’s which
badge-’older is entitled to a free ’oliday, and
a sum o’ ten pound will be paid over on the
production of the badge at this orfice, Num-
ber 75 Dook-street; or, if more convenient,
the badge may be forwarded under registered
cover, when a cheque for ten pound will be
sent by return. Please note : Ten pound give
away each week. The prize last week was
awarded to Mr. ’Ener.y Mills, badge number
84, ’oo, our readers will be interested to learn,
’as bin a sufferer from loco —loco —locomo-
tion attacks yer’ ”
“Wot in the name o ’eaven’s that, Sam?”
asked the awestruck Mr. Maunder.
“Oh, it means as ’ow ’e’s been knocked
down and punctured by one o’ them noo-
fangled motor-car cabs wot goes without
’orses,” explained Mr. Sharp hurriedly.
“. . . . ‘attacks yer fer many years. We offer
’im our ’artiest congratulations.’ ”
“Wot, ’cos ’e were knocked down be a
cab?” said Mr. Maunder, incredulously.
“Silly bit ’o sorce, I call it.”
“ ‘The prize this week,’ ” continued Mr.
Sharp, still reading, “ ‘ ’as bin awarded to
Mr. Frederick Sharp, Badge-’older one
’undered an’ forty-five, address 22 Buckle
Row, Port Melbourne.’ ’Ere, Jerry, wot
did yer say was the number o’ that blessed
ole soup ticket o’ yers?”
“One ’undered an’ forty-five,” replied Mr.
Maunder.
Sam reflected for a moment. “The paper
on’y come out this mornin’,” said he, “and
?t ain’t quite 12 o’clock yet. I reck’n it’s a
bit risky. Still it’s worth tryin’. Curious
thing, ain’t it; same name as mine—Sharp?
And, funnier still, my second name’s Fred-
erick, though I’d a’most fergot it.” He care-
fully folded up his copy of Society Doings,
and placed it in his coat pocket. “Give us
’old o’ that badge, an’ put yer ’at on, Jerry.
Reck’n we'll vo an’ give them society blokes
a look in.”
“If you can git £lO out of ’em, I don’t
mind givin’ yer one fer yerself, Sam,” said
Mr. Maunder generously.
Society Doings, to quote its own rather
ambiguous words, was a journal with a cir-
culation second to none. “Nulli Secundus,”
in Gothic characters, stared the reader out
of countenance when he turned to the table
of contents. The same proud boast was
writ large on the face of the decidedly trucu-
lent-looking gentleman who received Messrs.
Maunder and Sharp in an office which was
certainly second to none for stuffiness and
general inconvenience.
Nothing daunted by the forbidding mien
of the society specialist, Sam produced, for
inspection and verification, his current copy
of the journal, together with the member-
ship badge.
“Name of Frederick Sharp, 22 Buckle
Row, Port Melbourne. Number one ’undered
an’ forty-five, boss,” he announced genially.
The journalist took the proffered badge and
subjected it to a microscopic scrutiny ; then
he reached for a big leather-bound book, and,
opening it, ran a finger down a page or two
before he found what he wanted.
“Oh, here we are,” he said. “Frederick
Sharp, 22 Buckle Row. Yes, that seems all
right. Are you the party?”
Sam nodded. Jerry looked on with a
covetous eye, as the maker and breaker of
social reputations unlocked an iron cashbox
and took from its recesses a couple of crisp
bank-notes.
“Suppose you’ve no banking account,” he
remarked curtly. “So I won’t bother about
writing a cheque. Here’s a receipt form;
sign your name in full. Got a duty stamp?”
Sam, breathing very hard, his elbows
squared on the counter, pen seriously ink-
logged, passed the question on to Mr. Maun-
der. “Got a jewty stomp, Jerry?”
Mr. Maunder sniggered feebly, but made
no response.
The journalist, fumbling in his cashbox,
brought forth a duty stamp.
“One penny for the stamp,” he demanded
abruptly.
“Don’t yer ’ear, Jerry? One penny fer
the stomp,” grunted Mr. Sharp, as with his
little finger he smeared out the large S A M
of Sam and substituted the even larger capi-
tal F of Frederick.
Mr. Maunder, searching diligently, struck
treasure trove in the hin-pocket of his pants
—a couple of battered halfpennies, to wit —
just as Sam came to the end of his labored
signature.
The censor of Society’s Doings handed
over the bank-notes. “Wish you a pleasant
holiday,” he said casually. “Good-day.”
Sam and Jerry turned to depart. Never
before had either of them so ardently
desired the free and open air of Heaven.
But even as they reached the door, it was
flung open violently from the outside —to
the grievous peril of Jerry, who was in the
van —and a red-faced, portly youth of some
thirteen summers, burst into the office.
“Me name’s Sharp,” he yelped shrilly.
“Frederick Sharp ; and I’ve lost me” ——•
Sam stood stock still, as if suddenly petri-
fied, his mouth agape, his eyes the eyes of
one who has looked upon the dreaded basilisk
of fable. As he subsequently affirmed, he
knew that he was up against trouble, “and
no bloomin’ error.” It was at this critical
juncture that Jerry displayed those powers
of resource and initiative that, had he been
born under a luckier star, would have
undoubtedly made him a leader among men.
His large, red hand descended heavily upon
the intruder’s shoulder, and checked at the
fountain-head a far too ready flow of speech.
“You’ve lost yer manners —that’s wot
you’ve lost, my lad,” he said severely.
“Runnin’ in on me an’ yer pore father an’
this ’ere gen’leman without so much as by
yer leave. Now, none o’ yer back answers,
young Fred, ’cos I won’t ’ave it, an’ so I
fell yer.” He swung round on the astonished
social reformer. “Me friend’s son an' my
gaw’son, sir,” he explained ; “though I could
wish as ’ow 7 sech was not the case, con-
siderin’ ’is conduck. He come along to tell
’is pore dad that ’e’s lost ’is situation in the
’olesale drapery, an’ small wonder, knowin’
as I do the bitter trial he is to all as lays
’emselves out to give ’im a ’elpin' ’and. ’Old
yer tongue ! D’yer’ear me?” He shook the
maligned youth so fiercely by the collar that
signs of incipient strangulation supervened.
“Well, you can clear out of this, the lot
of you, as soon as you like.” suggested the
journalist brusquely, as he prepared _to
resume his interrupted labors of “cleansing
the Augean stables of society,” vide his lead-
ing article of last week but one.
Sam pushed Jerry and his unhappy victim
out into Duke-street, a quiet, unfrequented
by-way. But whether it was that, like many
another highly-strung and imaginative per-
son, Mr. Maunder had thoroughly persuaded
himself that the figment of his fancy was
irrefragable fact; or whether, like an over-
zealous actor, he was so carried away by his
part that he found it quite impossible to
descend all at once to every-day existence, is
a hard question to answer. A sort of magni-
ficent frenzy seemed for the time being to
have taken possession of the ancient man ;
and he did so maul, cuff and rumple the
shock head of his protesting cantive that
Sam felt it incumbent upon himself to inter-
pose. “Let ’im alone, carn’t yer, Jerry?
You’ll ’ave a crowd round us in less’n two
ticks.” he remonstrated.
“Wot’s the boy bin doin’ of, old ’un?”
inquired a man who happened to be passing
by at the moment. Two or three other
foot passengers also paused and regarded the
proceedings with some interest. v
“Doin’ of?” shouted the enraged Mr. Maun-
der. “Why, ’e’s bin sorcin’ ’is pore father
’ere, wot’s too broken-’arted to ’it ’im back.
Lost ’is situation in the ’olesale ’ardware
trade owin’ to bad habits; and instead o’
bringin’ the week’s wages wot they give ’im
in 100 o’ notice ’ome with ’im, ’e’s spent it
all in righteous” (probably riotous) “livin’.
Twelve bob, it were. Oh, ’e’s a wrong ’un,
’e is, all right. ’Old still, or I’ll be the death
on you, I will, my lad !”

Rusty Nail.
Poisoned Foot Healed.
Mrs. M. Dehon, who lives
at 53 Little Albion Street,
Surry Hills, Sydney, says:
“One day whilst crossing the
yard I slipped, and a rusty
nail penetrated my foot and
caused a painful --jury. Within
a few days blood-poisoning set
in, and my foot and leg began to
be extremely inflamed and swollen.
Night after night I would lie awake
in agony, and often the pain made me
cry out aloud. For some time I was
too crippled to get about, or do anything.
After reading about Zam-Buk I sent for
a large pot of the balm. I began to apply
dressings of .Zam-Buk to the injury twice
daily, and it soon effected a noticeable im-
provement. My foot w*as freed of pain, the
swelling and inflammation were greatly reduced,
and the wound began to look a lot healthier.
“I persevered with Zam-Buk until the wound was
thoroughly rid of all bad matter, and then it healed
ranidl.v and perfectly. I cannot speak too highly
of Zam-Buk.”
For everyday skin sores, flesh wounds and injuries, Zam-
Buk is a reliable healer to keep always handy. Of all
chemists and storekeepers, at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY,
and How to obtain it.
To-day every woman of taete and refinement avoids the use of cosmetics or made-up
toilet preparations which give an artificial appearance. The fresh, natural complexion that
few women have, and every woman desires, is best obtained by use of original ingredients
already at hand or which can be obtained from any reliable chemist. My advice is to avoid
the use of most made-up face creams, rouge and beautifying preparations. They are usually
obvious and often disappointing. If you will get only the proper original ingredients you will
be satisfied with the result. Insist on having what you ask for. If the chemist does not
happen to have it in stock, he can immediately get it from his wholesaler.
Oood Shampoo Important. —The hair should
be allowed to breathe, and the greasy film
around each strand must be removed with a
mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the pur-
pose can be made by dissolving a teaspoonful
of stallax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and at
the same time leaves the hair in that soft,
fluffy condition so much admired. Any chemist
can supply you with an original packet of
stallax, sufficient to make 25 or 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —It is astound-
ing the number of women who suffer from
unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know
that there is a simple substance known as
powdered pheminol which will remove it im-
mediately and permanently. Mix a small
quantity into a thin paste with a little water,
and apply to the objectionable growths. In
two minutes all trace of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin will be as
soft and smooth as a child’s.
To have Smooth, White Skin all through the
Winter. —Does your skin chap or roughen
easily, or become unduly red or blotchy ? Let
me tell you a quick and easy way to over-
come the trouble and keep your complexion
beautifully white, smooth and soft. Just get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chem-
ist’s, and use a little before retiring as you
would use cold cream. The wax, through
some peculiar action, flecks off the rough, dis-
colored or blemished skin. The worn-out
cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a dis-
eased scalp only in almost invisible particles.
Mercolised wax simply hastens Nature’s
work, which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after, but very seldom seen. The process is
perfectly simple and quite harmless.
For Dry, Irritating and Dandruffy Scalps.
can compare with the following
recipe for the above condition, and until you
have rectified any trouble in this direction it
is useless to expect the hair to grow healthy
and vigorous. Mix a package of boranium
with J-pint of bay rum, shake the bottle well
and allow to stand for 30 minutes, then add
i-pint cold water and strain. This simple
home remedy will stimulate the hair roots to
their normal functions, resulting in a beauti-
ful growth of new hair.
Rouge Not Necessary.—lf you must add a
little color to the cheeks please do not use
rouge; it is always so painfully obvious that
women of refinement have now discarded it
for ever. There is a little-known substance
called colliandum obtainable at most chem-
ist’s, which can be used in its place. It gives
a perfectly natural tint and defies the closest
scrutiny, besides having the undoubted ad-
vantage of not rubbing off.
The Powder Puff Passes.—-A persistently
shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless complexion
drives many a woman to cosmetics and conse-
quent despair. And all the time a simple
remedy lies at hand in the home. Get from
your, chemist about an ounce of cleminite,
and add sufficient water to dissolve it. A
little of this simple lotion is Nature’s own
beautifier. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powdering
entirely unnecessary and absolutely defies
detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined to bs
rough or harsh use a soft stick of prolactum.
An ideal complexion soap is one called
pilenta. It contains no free alkali, and is as
near neutrality as science can make it.
To make the eyelashes grow long, dark and
curling, massage them gently with mennaline.
It is quite a harmless substance, and will not
injure the eyes.

“Leggo me collar, then! You ’it one o’
yer own size, carn’t yer....’00 are you
callin’ me father? ’E ain’t me father.. ..I
wouldn’t hold to ’im. .. .1 never seen neither
of yer ugly mugs before —not in all me life,”
gasped the purple-faced juvenile, speaking
in sections. “An’ you jest gimme my
£lO wot you swindled me out of —I see
’im put my ’oliday badge in ’is pocket w’en
’e thought I wasn’t lookin’.”
“He’s got a bad, cunnin’-lookin’ sort of a
face fer a young boy,” remarked one of the
spectators. “You take my advice, my lad,
and go ’ome quietly with yer pore ole grand-
father” (Mr. Maunder winced slighily), “or
else you’ll be cornin’ to the gallus one o’ these
fine days.”
“He ain’t me grandfather. I never saw
’im before, not in all me life,” howled the
indignant youth.
“ ’Ave you searched ’is boots, mister?”
asked another onlooker, addressing Jerry
with the air of one proffering good counsel.
“I ’ad a boy once—terribly artful boy, ’e
<vas, and fer munce and munce, ev’ry Satur-
dee, reg’lar as clockwork, ’e used to ’ide ’arf
a crown in ’is boot an’ make out that he’d
never got the rise ’is boss promised ’im.”
“Oh, carm on, Jerry,” expostulated Mr.
Sharp, in an agitated aside. “Drop the kid,
do, and let’s clear, quick ’n’ lively.”
But Mr. Maunder was not to be denied.
Retaining a vice-like hold of his victim’s
collar, with one huge hand he rapidly, and
with the skill born of long practice, went
through the wriggling youth’s pockets, re-
gardless of kicks and recriminations. At
the end of the operation, he was the richer
by three half-crowns.
“Now, you come straight ’ome, my lad,
an’ I’ll give yer the liveliest ’idin’ ever you
’ad,” he said with decision.
“That’s the way to tork to boys,” ob-
served a spectator admiringly. “The velvet
glove in the iron ’and. ’E ain’t too old fer
the strap, Mister.”
“Cert’ly not,” said Mr. Maunder firmly.
“Wait till I git at ’im with my braces.”
He set off at a dignified pace, holding
the volubly protesting Master Sharp by the
arm. Sam, shivering with fury, and mutter-
ing the direst threats of vengeance to come,
accompanied the disciplinarian and his
charge. The little knot of onlookers
reluctantly dispersed, shaking their heads
sagely.
“Wodger goin’ to do now, Jerry?”
demanded Sam, gritting his teeth savagely.
Mr. Maunder grinned a senile grin. He
was face to face with the stern realities of
existence once again.
“Gawd knows, Sam. If I could on’y find
a nice deep drain ’andy I’d drop ’im in.
Reck’n we ’ad to keep the game up afore
all them people; but wot to do with ’im
now, I’ve about as much idea as wot you
’as. If I let ’im go ’e’ll track us ’ome as
like as not an’ then bring the cops. ’E
looks wicked enough for anythin’. An’ if
I don’t let ’im go I’ll ’ave to drag ’im ’ome,
which’ll be as bad.”
“Well, if you like to walk ’arf over Mel-
bourne ’limpin’ that ’ere squawkin’ limb o’
Satan along with you, you can please yer-
self, but don’t arst me to keep you com-
p’ny,” retorted Sam, regarding the now
lachrymose juvenile with intense disfavor.
“Fer ’Eaven’s sake don’t go back on a
bloke, Sam,” besought Mr. Maunder in
some alarm. “You jest give over tryin’ to
kick yer elders an’ betters, my young
sparrer-’opper, or else I’ll ’and you out wot
for. Blest if ever I come acrost sech a
’eadstrong. vindickertive boy, no, not in all
my born days.”
“Serve yer right,” said Sam shortly, as
the tears of anguish, tapped by a well-
planted kick on the shins, welled up in
Jerry’s eyes.
“You lemme go then,” screamed the
captive, exultantly conscious that he had
at last succeeded in getting a good solid one
home on his tormentor.
Jerry shook him by the neck, much as a
terrier shakes a rat. “I’ll be the death on
you in less ’n ’arf a minute,” he vowed for
about the twentieth time.
“Wot are you doin’ to that boy, you great
coward? If you don’t drop ’im I’ll drop
you, soon as look at you,” said a deep, de-
termined voice that should by rights have be-
longed to a man. But it was the attribute
of a big woman with an apron over her
head, and a bottle of beer peeping coyly from
its newspaper wrappings, tucked under each
arm.
With a shrill whoop of triumph, Mr.
Maunder’s protege made a supreme effort
aDd broke away from his stern mentor’s de-
taining hold.
“Give it to ’em ’ot, mother,” he shouted.
“They done me outer ten pound ’oliday
money, an’ the ole bloke with the injer-
lubber mug ’as bin through me pockets an’
pinched the seven an’ six wot you give me
to pay ole Four-eyes ’is_ week’s rent with!”
“ ’Old yer tongue, you young viper, and
wait till yer spoken to,” was the fond
maternal response, accompanied by a back-
hander that not only sent the luckless youth
spinning into the gutter, but seriously jeo-
pardised one of the’ beer bottles. Then she
turned on Mr. Sharp, the high color of
whose naturally rubicund face had changed
to a sickly greenish hue. “Well, if this ain’t
a stroke o’ luck.” she remarked grimly. “I
’eard you was in Brisbane. Sam.”
Mr. Sharp grinned guiltily. “Thought
you’d gone west,” he muttered. “I posted
the last remittance wot I sent to the address
you give me in Perth.”
“That was a year an’ a ’alf ago,” re-
torted the lady; “and I ain’t touched a
copper o’ yers ever since. Wot yer goin’ to
do about it, might I kindly arsk? That
there boy o’ yers ain’t kep’ fer nixes, an’ the
young rin never sticks to a job more’n a
week. Takes arter ’is good-fer-nuthin’
father, I s’pose.” She finished with a sniff
militant.
“Called ’im Freddy arter me! That was
kind an’ thoughtful, I must own; though I
shouldn’t ’ardly ’ave knowed ’im, not arter
all these years,” said Sam, making a feeble
attempt to draw a red herring across the
track of the virgo’s wrath. “He were in
petticoats last time I saw ’im” —
“’Oo’s yer friend?” interrupted the lady
of the beer bottles, regarding Mr. Maunder
with a fixed and hostile stare.
Jerry shuffled his feet uneasily. Mr.
Sham welcomed this heaven-sent opportunity
of side tracking the financial question.
“Why, that’s ole Jerry Maunder,” he ob-
served with a ghastly parody of his usual
free-and-easy manner. “A pal_o’ mine. Jerry,
this ’ere’s my missus. We ain’t bin playin’
speaks these last few years.”
Mr. Maunder cleared his throat huskily,
and in an agony of apprehension sought to
evade the matron’s vengeful eye.
“Pleased to meet you both, I’m sure,”
said Mrs. Sharp with a vinegary smile.
“And, an.v’ow, I wants ten pounds out o’ yer,
Sam. We may as well come inside, instead
o’ yappin’ here. I live just round the cor-
ner—-22 Buckle Row.”
“Ten pounds—s’welp me!” began Mr.
Sharp in genuine consternation.
“Oh, I wasn’t born yesterday,” put in his
wife tartly. “It’s ten pounds down or a
policeman, whichever you prefer. You can’t
marry a girl and then leave ’er to toil and
moil fer ’erself and the son wot you was
responsible fer, and can’t deny it, seein’ as
’ow be ’as all of ’is father’s vices and none
of his poor mother’s virtues. Come inside,
and you too, Mr. Monday, or whatever yer
name is.”
Mrs. Sham’s living room could hardly be
called a luxuriously-appointed apartment,
but besides the two bottles of beer afore-
mentioned, it contained a full bottle of gin,
and the lady, to do her justice, had a due
regard to the rules of hospitality. But per-
haps for the first time in his mis-spent life,
Mr. Maunder refused liquid refreshment.
“Never mind; all the more fer us,” was
Mrs. Sharp’s curt comment. “Now then
Sam, ’elp yerself.”
Sam helped himself —liberally.
Seated comfortlessly on the edge of an
uneasy chair, momentarily apprehensive of
the advent of the banished Master Sharp, Mr.
Maunder listened in speechless indignation,
firstly, to the heated recriminations of thp
newly-united couple; secondly, to their
general rapprochement, an edifying consum-
mation entirely brought about by the soften-
ing influences of that seductive mixture
“Dog’s Nose” ; thirdly and lastly, to a com-
plete entente cordiale, cemented by the pro-
duction and unconditional handing over by
Mr. Sharp of two crisp five-pound notes.
“Now, ’Tilda, I ’one yer satisfied,” said Sam.
Mrs. Sharp nodded. “I alius said you was
a gen’leman w’en in licker, Sam,” she re-
marked. Rising with a stateliness somewhat
marred by an inadvertent lurch, which neces-
sitated a saving clutch at the table, she de-
posited the notes in a cracked vase that
stood on the mantelpiece. Then she returned
to her seat, but her eye for the unconvivial
Mr. Maunder was soured and jaundiced.
“Settin’ there like a ’eathen Tndoo image
—addle-’eaded ole fowl!” she muttered, with
a complete disregard for the mating of her
metaphors.
“Never mind ’im,” said Sam, contemptu-
ously. “ ’Ole Jerry don’t count. Give us a
kiss’ ’Tilda, to show there ain’t no ill-
feelin’.”
The endearments that followed so nau
seated the high-minded Mr. Maunder that
he rose from his seat and leant heavily
against the mantelpiece, as if for support.
He stood there a moment, then made
majestically for the door.
“I ain’t a-goin’ to stop ’ere no longer.”
he announced firmly. “I can see I ain’t
wanted. Wish yer joy, Sam.” He sniffed
loudly. “If there’s one smell in this world
wot I do ’ate and detest, it’s gin,” he added
vindictively; then the door closed abruptly
upon his ancient, shambling form.
Jerry had been back at number eleven
Silver-street two or three hours before Sam
put in an appearance, rather .red about the
eyes, and looking distinctly woebegone.
The old man greeted the prodigal coldly.
“I’m afraid you’ve bin livin’ a double-faced
life, Sam,” he said sternly. “You bin
deceivin’ me as well as that pore long-
sufferin’ wife o’ yers ; while as fer yer dear
little son an’ hair—Gawd ’elp us!”
Mr. Sharp tossed his hat across the room.
“If the ole girl ’adn’t a-bin so shicker I’d
never ’ave got away from ’er,” he growled.
“Well, a fine mess you’ve made o’ the bis-
ness, ain’t you, Jerry Maunder. But fer
yer dam’ foolishness we’d ha’ bin a fiver
each in pocket this blessed minute.”
Mr. Maunder grinned. “Orright, don’t
git narked, mate,” he said soothingly. “It
all stops in the fam’ly. And if I don’t
begrudge my little bit to ’elp bi’iug some
’appiness an’ sunshine into that there pore,
lonely, neglected woman’s life, I’m sure you
didn’t ought to. Besides” (he rattled the
loose silver in his pocket), “we’re three ’arf
a crowns to the good—leastways, I am.”
Sam turned a thundercloud visage on his
comrade.
“You jest ’and over them three ’arf crowns
at onst, Jerry,” he said fiercely. “They
belong to my pore boy wot you so croolly
robbed ; an’ wot’s more, I mean to ’old ’em
in trust fer ’im until he comes of an age
to unnerstand the value o’ money. Now
are you a-goin’ to fork out, or ’ave I gotter
make you?”
Jerry struggled manfully with his emo-
tion. He pulled the cash from his pocket
and flung it on the table with a fine dramatic
gesture. “Take it,” he said bitterly. “You’re
the bloke wot never rounds on ’is cobbers,
ain’t yer? Buy Guv’ment securities with
it, an’ wotever you do, don’t fergit to add
on the hinterest w’en you come to settle
up with that lively young ’opeful o’ yers.”
Sam picked up the money, and laughed
a rude, derisive laugh. “I can do better
than Guv’ment securities, Jerry,” he re-
marked. “I’m goin’ to invest it in a
brewery wot I knows of. So long; see
you later. Sorry I carn’t arst yer to come
along with me. on’y one ’as to be partic’lar
about one’s comp’ny w’en there’s bisness
doin’. Eh?” He paused, his hand on the
door-latch. “I’ll ’ave to sample the beer
first, to see if I think the speculation’s worth
while,” he said, with a cunning wink.
“Ketch ’old, mate, ’ere’s a ’oliday badge
fer yer—number one hindered an’ forty-
five.”
Left alone, Jerry sighed a requiem sigh
in memory of a long partnership now dis-
solved for ever. Then he felt in his breast
pocket, and having reassured himself con-
cerning the safety of the two bank notes
that reposed therein, he took a farewell
glance round the little room, and stole
cautiously away into the fast-gathering
dusk.
Mr. Tiberius Galilee discounted the notes
at a special rate of twenty-five per cent.

BOILER TROUBLES
and THEIR REMEDY
fIPEXIGK
NOT A
BOILER
FLUID
Let Your Boilerman Make a Test
Give him a Two-gallon Drum of Apexior—see that he applies it
in the right way—and after a few months ask him if it has
not stopped corrosion and pitting—if there is more scale on the
parts not covered with Apexior—if the small amount of scale
adhering to the part that is covered with Apexior falls off with
the slightest tap —if he thinks the efficiency of the Boiler would
be increased by its exclusive use. We are willing to let Apexior
be judged by his answer. But send for a trial drum while you
think of it.

What a Shotgun
Shooter Says:
“I have been shooting a shotgun all my
life; in fact it is by far my favorite sport.
We shotgun shooters are very partic-
ular. Having used every brand of
cartridges on the market, I have definite
reasons for selecting RemingtonzUMC
cartridges. I believe their steel lined,
waterproofed cases and careful loading
give me better pattern and greater pen-
etration at longer distances. That means
better results and a better day’s sport. When
I find something good I stick to it, so specify
RemingtOfl-UMC when laying in supplies.

The
Importance
of
Efficient
Insulation!
The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings‘are fully borne out by actual test, and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts whith will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
