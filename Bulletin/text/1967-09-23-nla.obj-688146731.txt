Now Wridgways introduce ‘Home Pack’containers
so you don’t have to move in glass houses.
The old way was:
The removalist’s van called. Your furniture
was carted out (and sometimes sorted on the
lawn) and loaded.
Then, if you wanted it stored, it was unloaded
from the van and carted into a warehouse.
When you ultimately wanted it delivered, it
was again carted from the warehouse and
loaded into the van. Sometimes, like in a move
from Melbourne to Brisbane, your furniture
might be transhipped unloaded in Sydney
and shifted to another vail going to Brisbane.
A lot of public viewing.
And a lot of handling. And exposure—to dust,
moths, silverfish, pilferers.
Wridgways’ new ‘Home Pack’ Containers end
all that.
At your home, all of your furniture, all your
belongings, are locked into a sealed ‘Home
Pack’ container, there, before your eyes. Now
Wridgways will do what you like with it. Store
it. Deliver it to its destination. Privately. And
more importantly, safely.
No dust. No mildew. No moths or silverfish-
No pilferers. And ‘Home Pack’ moving and
storing is just as economical as “the old way”.
So now you don’t have to move in a glass
house. But we still handle all your belongings
as if they were glass.
‘Home Pack’ Containers are operating now
between Melbourne and Sydney and will be
introduced progressively to all states.
Moving or storing—think of the “double W”

‘PERSONAL
STORAGE
can save
you money
To replace furniture costs money.
To store it is much more economical
than you might think.
So if you’re temporarily without
housing after selling, while build-
ing, overseas or for any other reason
think about storing your belong-
ings.
Wridgways offer Australia’s largest
storage facilities. All under cover.
And at Wridgways it’s Personal
Storage because it’s locked con-
tainer storage. This means that all
your goods are sealed in individual
containers. Well packed. Dust free.
Moth and mildew free. Free from
pilferage.
And private.
You won’t find storage quite this
good anywhere else.
And it costs no more than anywhere
else. Certainly much less than re-
buying.

Lady Luck's
favors are
a real lottery
ONE THING THAT IS rarely men-
tioned is the fine communal feeling
created by lotteries. Tasmanians, South
Australians, and even Western Austra-
lians, by contributing to Tattersalls un-
selfishly help the very best Melburnian
hospitals. We, on the other hand, are
frightfully decent about the Sydney
Opera House. We make few untoward
remarks and we look forward hopefully
to its completion. After all, Victorians,
through their continuing devotion to the
Opera House lottery, own at least 25
percent of it.
Despite all this, there is a crisis
ahead. We Australians are not gambling
on our lotteries with sufficient gusto and
enthusiasm. If you look up a copy of
the Bureau of Statistics’ pocket com-
pendium, you will find that the rate of
growth in lottery investments is tapering
off. For 1964-65 —the last year for
which figures are available —ticket sales
totalled $88.7 million. This was $2.1
million above the 1963-64 level. Invest-
ments in 1963-64 were $4 million higher
than in 1962-63 and the 1962-63 total
was $7.4 million higher than for the
previous year.
Victorian Government revenue from
Tattersalls has remained steady at
around $6 million for the past decade.
We are simply not lottery-ticket buying
with a patriotic vigor commensurate
with the growth of population. Then, to
make matters worse, South Australia last
May launched its State lottery. We had
rather hoped that South Australia would
remain the one refuge of decency and
keep contributing to us.
In the face of all this, Tattersalls
has just dropped the first can of napalm
in an. inevitable lottery war. Before, we
paid 50 cents for a ticket, the first
prize was $20,000, and we had one
chance in 95 of picking up a prize.
Now we pay 60 cents, the first prize
is $25,000, and we have one chance in
77 of getting a prize. In Queensland,
you pay 60 cents, first prize is $15,000,
and you have one chance in 79. In the
N.S.W. State lottery you pay 55 cents,
get one chance in 79, and first prize is
$12,000. In South Australia you pay
50 cents and the first prize is $14,000.
It remains to be seen yet whether
the citizens will be excited by this new
Tattersalls arrangement. There’s no
question that prizes do have to be im-
pressive to make the grade. After all,
this winter, our letter boxes were filled
with pamphlets for a Queensland Art
Union. The first prize was a Piper
Cherokee 140 valued at $13,097.62 and
$5OO worth of flying lessons at any fly-
ing school in Australia, plus “a twin-
patio house at Surfers Paradise valued
at $21,000.” Yes, a mad desire for twin
patios sure leads to drops in lottery-
licket buyers.
Tattersalls has a PR firm working
for it and much is made of its grand
old reputation. It began in 1881 and it
is the oldest continuous lottery in the
world. The furry features of the late
George Adams stare at one with stern
rectitude from every Tatts ticket. He
is supposed to impart a feeling of com-
plete trust, like Beecham’s pills.
The whole story is told in a Tatts
brochure which has some quite marvel-
lous lines. Take this bit: “Tattersalls is
a golden treasury of good-luck stories
stories with a hearty ring of a happy
ending, stories with a sob and a. throb
of human interest. When Lady Luck
plays the heroine she makes her
entrance riding on a rainbow. Mostly
Tatts tales are rich in wedding bells,
home runs and happy landings, ambi-
tions achieved, anxieties alleviated,
security in sight at last, travel, educa-
tion, even luxury . . .”
But the fascinating feature in all this
is that Tattersalls, at last, has been
accepted. When the manager announced
an increase to 60 cents with bigger
stakes, whetting our appetites to gamble,
for the first time there was no cry
of rage from the anti-gamblers. You
must realise that Tattersalls has had a
fairly hounded history. It was pushed
out of New South Wales by State legis-
lation in 1893. It went to Brisbane only
to suffer the same fate. The Queensland
Parliament passed anti-sweeps legisla-
“I hope that convinces people that
gambling interstate is awful!”

Dewar’s
drinkers know they’re right
DW3
Know how to read a Scotch
label and you’ll always buy
the right Scotch.
On the Dewar’s label the
word 'Old' means that, by law
the contents have been
matured in wood for at least
five years. When you taste
Dewar’s you will appreciate
its greater maturity.
That name 'Dewar’s'
represents 120 years contin-
uous service by members of
the Dewar family.
The words ‘Scotch’ and ‘Wholly
Distilled, Matured and
Blended in Scotland' are your
guarantees that Dewar’s is
entirely distilled and blended
by experts under ideal
conditions—in Scotland.
The Dewar’s label is a
guarantee of Dewar’s quality.
Read it, and you'll be sure you
are getting the right Scotch
—it never varies.
tion and on the last day of December,
1895, it transferred to Tasmania.
Of course, much of Tatts business
was in plain envelopes to Victoria. I
treasure a copy of a publication called
“Reyiew of Reviews” for March 1,
1907. It was edited by Mr. W. H.
Judkins, Melbourne’s Savonarola, the
fieriest Methodist preacher we have
known. He made a Pleasant Sunday
Afternoon at the Wesley Church a
bobby dazzler. He wrote: “Kicked out
of Australia like a diseased dog, kicked
out into the street, the institution known
all over Australasia as Tattersalls found
a welcome and a kennel in Tasmania.
It was too bad to be received anywhere
else, but it shivered at Tasmania’s door
and offered to pay for board and
lodging. It was evident that its presence
would spell corruption, for it itself was
corrupt. But what mattered that? Tas-
mania was unfortunate in its choice
of Parliamentary representatives when
the whine was made for admittance and
they sold her body and soul for what
Tattersalls was willing to pay. So the
bargain was made, and for £60,000 a
year the evil thing was allowed to enter.
It was made comfortable and, being
practically und£r Government patron-
age, has grown fat, although its disease
is as loathsome as ever.”
Mr. Judkins then went on to say
how significant it was that two mem-
bers of the Tasmanian Upper House
and two of the Lower House received
shares in George Adams’ will when he
died in 1904.
In 1954 the brave Labor Premier
of Victoria, Mr. Cain, wooed Tatter-
salls across to Melbourne. We were
giving Tasmania £12,000 a week any-
way, 30 percent of each lottery’s pro-
ceeds. There was a fearful outcry from
the Churches, with protest meetings all
over the city. For example, the Rev.
Crichton Barr at Scots Church said: “I
have seen lotteries cause the most appal-
ling domestic misery. A lottery is equal
in potential ruin to persistent drunken-
ness. It is an appeal to naked greed."
The Venerable Archdeacon Schofield
said: “It is the utter negation of
brotherly love. It is the sin of Judais.”
Dr. A. H. Wood of the Methodist
Church said: “When nations were vir-
tually fighting for survival it was evi-
dence of national weakness that many
Australians wanted money for nothing.”
But, as I say, we don’t get these out-
cries any more. Your correspondent is
not over-worried by the increase in
price to 60 cents. In 20 years of trying
he has never even won a fiver. He has
experienced absolutely no stories with a
sob and a throb of human interest and
Lady Luck riding in on a rainbow.
However, you will be interested to
hear that in every consultation at least
50 syndicates put their faith in cats.
These cats have taken prizes: Don’t
knock the cat, Pussy cat, Ginger cat,
Cath’s black cat, White cat, Chicky
puss, Red cat, Two cats, Pussy tabby
cat. Two black cats and Fluffy, in a
special consultation, won $60,000. Is
that of any help?

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
Foreign capital
problems are
still unsolved
THE RIGHT AND sensible way to get
foreign capital is to borrow it, not sell
ourselves for it; the right and sensible
way to get foreign know-how is to hire
it, not have it take us over. So last
week’s news that the new Australian
Resources Development Bank Ltd. is
soon to begin business with the stated
aim of “enhancing Australian owner-
ship and control of our natural re-
sources” is one step along the road
toward improving what has become an
intolerable situation.
For in the field of natural resources
development, where so much of our
effort is being spent these days, we
have gone about getting foreign capital
and skills in exactly the wrong way.
Largely because of our own indolence
we have sold out. It is dreadful that
even such devoted nationalists as
Hancock and Wright had nowhere else
to go but to overseas interests to get
their Hamersley resources developed, or
that Roy Hudson found that foreigners
were the only people capable of
handling his Savage River iron-ore
deposits.
But let’s get this straight from the
beginning: the problem of foreign capi-
tal has not been solved by the creation
of the Australian Resources Develop-
ment Bank last week. In the first place
the bank—to be owned and managed
by the eight local trading banks with
Reserve Bank financial help in its early
years—can never remove the need for
large slabs of overseas#money if Aus-
tralia is to be developed at any sort of
a reasonable pace. And, secondly, it is
absurd to think that setting up this
bank is all that the Government need
do to prevent foreign interests getting
an even more unreasonable degree of
control over Australian natural re-
sources than they already have. This is
a serious problem and, no matter how
welcome the new bank is, the fact re-
mains that it goes only a small part
of the way toward providing the finance
that is so desperately needed to develop
this country.
The realities are that there are
plenty of foreigners willing to lend us
the money (we are one of the most
attractive havens for foreign capital in
the world) without our having to give
them equity control, and that, if we
organised our own resources better, we
could provide a lot more of the equity
needed than we have done in the past.
True, the new bank will help marshal
some of these funds, but we will need
a lot more than this to ensure that
foreign equity participation in our
major developmental projects is kept
down to sensible levels. Banks are not
the only source of funds in this coun-
try; a mixture of official encourage-
ment of all the local capital-forming
institutions through taxation benefits
and of official restraint on the propor-
tions of equity that can be held from
overseas in our developmental projects
seems long overdue.
The list of natural resources that are
dominated by foreign-controlled com-
panies is quite fearful; a few weeks ago
on this page I pointed out the foreign
dominance in our iron-ore, oil, and
bauxite mining industries, but these are
only part of the story. Last week’s par-
tial takeover offer for Mt. Morgan Ltd.
by a group of major world financiers
led by the Canadian Power Corporation
(and including the mighty U.K.-South
African Oppenheimer interests) means
that one of the few remaining large Aus-
tralian-controlled mining companies is
to fall under foreign control. There is
no doubt that there are a lot of good
things about this takeover; it will leave
49 percent of the company’s capital
in Australian hands, it will provide a
source of massive additional funds for
the development of Mt. Morgan’s coal
and iron-ore activities, and for other
exploration, particularly needed if its
copper-gold mine proves to have no
more than about ten years’ reserves. It
will also enable the company to draw
on the vast technical resources of the
powerful groups (with assets of more
than $BOOO million) that are involved
in the takeover.
But is this the best way we could go
about this sort of thing? Do we have
to sell control in order to get the clear
benefits that come with it? The Mt.
Morgan takeover will leave only West-
ern Mining, with its nickel, North and
South Broken Hill, EZ Industries, and
Peko-Wallsend among the big-leaguers
as Australian-controlled mining com-
panies and there are plenty of
rumors around about the chance of
something happening to Peko.
Even our traditional minerals like
lead, zinc, silver, and copper are heavily
owned from overseas. The CRA-Zinc
Corporation-New Broken Hill group is
owned largely in Britain, with the rela-
tively small Australian shareholding
(only 16 percent in CRA) being very
much in minority. And 54 percent of
Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. is owned in America
by Asarco.
More than 70 percent of the uranium
reserves held privately (outside the
Government’s Rum Jungle operation)
are under the indirect control of the
British-dominated CRA group, which
some critics claim is more interested
in developing its Canadian uranium
operations than proceeding apace with
its Australian one. We’ve done a bit
better than usual in the latest nickel
boom, but there are still plenty of
foreign interests in strong positions in
the search. The CRA group is linked
with Anaconda in a recent discovery
near Kalgoorlie; Consolidated Gold-
fields Australia Ltd. (77 percent owned
from overseas), has some reserves; In-
ternational Nickel has some prospecting
rights on its own and is also linked
with BHP in an investigation in Queens-
land; Newmont Mines of the U.S. and
Charter Consolidated of the U.K. have
some reserves.
The old established coal industry is-
also falling under foreign control
at least those parts of it where there
seems to be worthwhile growth pros-
pects. The Bowen basin is seen as the
area of greatest potential for coal
exports; Queensland’s coal exports
which were 1.7 million tons in 1966 are
expected to jump to six million tons
by 1970, with good prospects for further
rises. But the two companies currently
holding export contracts from this area
are both foreign controlled Utah
Development, which is entirely foreign
owned, and Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui, that
is 78 percent foreign owned. And Mt.
Morgan, which has reserves in the
Dawson Valley, is now on the way to
foreign control. The old South Coast
mining company, Bellambi Coal, has
two large coal deposits in the Bowen
area, but it is now controlled by the
Consolidated Goldfields group.
In beach sands, another dramatic
success story in recent times, there is
heavy foreign investment. The biggest
rutile miner in Australia, Associated
Minerals, is mainly owned by Consoli-
dated Goldfields, and the third biggest,
Mineral Deposits, is 91 percent owned
by the U.S. National Lead Co. And of
course the übiquitous CRA group also
has a large finger in this pie.
One of the most cheering features
of the Government’s decision to foster
the establishment of the new Resources
Bank is that it shows the Government
is at last aware of the need to do some-
thing about the foreign investment prob-
lem. The new bank, which is expected
to have about $3OO million available
within a few years, aims at “marshal-
ling funds from local and overseas
sources for the financing of Australian
participation in projects of national im-
portance,” and should have some real
impact on the situation..
But welcome as is this official aware-
ness of the existence of a problem of
foreign control, the new bank is only
one of the steps needed to solve it.
The Government still has to recognise
that it has a much deeper responsibility
in this field.

We dreamt our ads made front page news
And when the paper was delivered, they
had! It happened when the Melbourne
Age took up all this front page space to
cover the filming of one of our Circle of
Safety ads.
A week later the Daily Mirror in
Sydney gave a similar coverage
to the filming of another.
And TV and radio stations sup-
ported us in both cases with
extensive news coverage too.
These are but a few examples of the
remarkable editorial attention the Circle of
Safety Campaign has enjoyed in the Austra-
lian mass media.
You say that this would not have been
possible if we’d been selling, not safety,
but our product?
Our product is safety.
That’s what the service at Mobil Service
Stations is all about.
Not dreams, or a quick trip to the moon.
Safety.

Credit where it is due
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED that
at all building sites it has become the
fashion to give credit to everyone in
sight and on site.
Melbourne is building very grand
new State offices. Outside there is an
even grander board, which not only
lists the name of the architects but also
the names of 40 others. It is almost as
good as the credits for “Gone With The
Wind.” You get the name of the firm
that put in the windows, the pavers,
the electricians, the quantity surveyors,
the tilers, until finally you get “towel
cabinets by Bowater-Scott.”
It’s pretty good when even the lava-
tory paper gets a credit.
Seeing daylight
AS IN TASMANIA the battle is on in
New Zealand for daylight saving. The
New Zealand “Herald” reports that
there are objections, particularly from
dairymen.
And we quote from this sober news-
paper: “One document submitted by
the Federated Farmers at parliamen-
tary hearings on the subject contained
some novel arguments. Mothers, it
said, claim they would have increased
difficulty in getting children to bed,
and the birthrate could decline because
people would be more tired when they
went to bed.
“Furthermore, immorality and van-
dalism would begin later in the evening
in public parks and cemeteries.”
Adelaide indecision
ADELAIDE City Council’s indecision
over the proposed 2500-seat Festival
Hall continues. The council’s recent
efforts recalled, for a newspaper car-
toonist, Stephen Leacock’s line . . . “he
flung himself upon his horse and rode
madly off in all directions.”
Centennial Hall, contemptuously
called the Barn, is undergoing renova-
tions to improve seating and backstage
accommodation for the next Festival of
Arts. But it’s only a patching-up opera-
tion.
Enter local businessman and entre-
preneur Derek Jolly. Unkindly picking
Adelaide Town Hall to make his
announcement, he has proposed a 700-
seat, multi-purpose hall within his chic
shop, restaurant, and art gallery com-
plex in North Adelaide. The. hall, a
memorial to the Festival’s first artistic
director, Professor John Bishop, will
be built for recitals, with facilities for
staging light opera, experimental
theatre, and films.
Luna in orbit
A LAVISH PRESS KIT full of pro-
vocative quotes preceded the arrival in
Sydney this week of Donyale Luna, one
of the world’s highest-paid fashion
models. But even that wasn’t an
adequate preparation for the full effect
of her first appearance.
She says there is a mixture of Negro,
Chinese, Indian, and Mexican blood
in her family, and she towered above
the press of people around the Customs
hall. A statuesque six-foot, with satiny-
brown skin, a curling chaos of black
hair, and eyes of an incongruously bril-
liant blue under contact lenses. She
wore black loose trouser suit, satin
shirt, lace jacket and an aura of
unreality.
To the airport Press, accustomed to
the tight-lipped thrust and parry of the
mass on-the-spot interview, she was
larger than life, a woman more than
ready to live up to the myth being
created around her.
She is here for fashion parades and
the Press kit talks of “the cloud of
exaggeration, contradiction, double-talk,
illusion, and delusion” with which she
surrounds herself. It adds emphatically
that she has never been married, despite
the fact that she claims she has
twice. But the mystery still remains,
since she reiterated the claim at the
airport.
In a soft, never-faltering trans-
atlantic drawl, she twice told the
“Cinderella story” of her discovery by
British freelance photographer David
McCabe two years ago, and her subse-
quent rise to the point where she now
commands $4OO an hour. She affection-
ately introduced her fiance of two
weeks, Georg Willing, whom she is con-
vinced she has met before in some
earlier life (“Salvador Dali says I was
Nefertiti. Perhaps or a bird, or
even a tree”), and revealed her ultim-
ate ambition “to have thousands of
children.”
Georg is German, an actor with a
fine-featured face and a hesitant man-
ner. He had had his 23rd birthday the
day before, and around his neck he
was wearing Donyale’s gift some
multi-colored Mexican beads. They
became engaged three hours after they
met in Paris a fortnight ago. What do
they have in common? “She says we are
both Virgos. She believes in the stars
I don’t. I think the main thing is
that we don’t have to talk any more.”
Donyale attributes her modelling suc-
cess to fate. “I thank God for mak-
ing me the way I am. I used to think
I was ugly, a freak, but now I love
the way I look and people love me.
“In this business, they are always
on the look-out for something new,
something different, and that’s fine. I
talk funny, wear my hair funny. A
lot of people wouldn’t dare to go out
of the house looking like this.
“No, I’m not embarrassed about my
height or my looks. I would like to
be nine feet. I always wear high heels,
because I think there is nothing more
beautiful than a tall girl with the-
right carriage. There is nothing worse
than one who tries to hide her height.
But as a child I hated it. I wanted to
have an operation to make me shorter,
have my legs cut off—anything.
“Yet I always knew I would be a
success, although I didn’t know it would
be in modelling. Actually, I see it in
three stages. Modelling is the first,
films, I think, will be next, then I want
to have millions of children.”
“Being a success” seems to have in-
volved Donyale in little effort other
than just being Donyale. After Mc-
Cabe met her in Detroit, where she
grew up, he took her to New York and
to “Harper’s Bazaar.” They took one
look, pronounced her sensational, and
her career rocketed accordingly.
Could she estimate the life expec-
tancy of her modelling career? “I
haven’t the vaguest idea. In this
business, I could be dead tomorrow.”

AS I SEE IT
What's good for
the ALP is
good for McMahon
By ALAN REID
TREASURER WILLIAM McMAHON
is under attack for having raised the
religious views of Dr. D. N. Evering-
ham, Labor candidate in Capricorhia
electorate for the House of Representa-
tives.
As I see it, McMahon did not raise
the subject. Everingham did—and in a
political context if McMahon quoted
accurately the article contributed by
Everingham to a booklet called “Dis-
cussion,” issued under the authorisation
of the Secretary of the Communist
Party, Mr. L. Aarons (and nobody has
questioned McMahon’s accuracy, only
his action), Everingham was using his
agnosticism or atheism as a means of
adding weight to a political argument.
Everingham’s argument was the Com-
munist Party should emphasise that
renunciation of a belief in any god is
not a requirement for membership of
the Communist Party provided the
member does not give any organised
religion authority over his owi or the
community’s political educatior belief,
or practice, and provided the alms of
any religious organisations he belongs
to are not in conflict with Party aims.
Says Everingham: “This would re-
move perhaps the largest barrier to mass
support for your Party and would cer-
tainly remove one of the most powerful
weapons of your opponents.”
Everingham then moves on to the
really significant thing. “It (adoption
of the course he recommends) may be
the largest single step in achieving a
united Labor Movement.” Now nobody
can tell me that the discussions of
prospects and methods for securing a
united front between the ALP and the
Communist Party (and this is clearly
what Everingham is talking about with
his reference to “achieving a united
Labor Movement”) is not a matter for
legitimate political comment. I agree
with McMahon that it is, just as I
would view any discussion of prospects
and methods for securing a united
front between the ALP and the DLP
as a matter that McMahon would be
entitled to bring to the notice of the
electors of Capricornia.
Everingham used his religious (or
non-religious) views as a buttress for
his arguments. What he was saying in
effect was that in advising the Com-
munist Party to secure the adherence
of a greater number of Christians he
could prove that he was objective and
detached and not pushing the barrow
of his own religious beliefs, because he
was a non-Christian. In other words,
his statement of his agnostic or
atheistic leanings (he seems to use the
words interchangeably) was put forward
as a claim to impartiality.
Again we find the emergence of the
“two standards” in political debate in
Australia. ALP Left-wingers feel it
quite proper (and I agree with them)
to discuss publicly the fact that Mr.
B. A. Santamaria is a Roman Catholic
and influenced profoundly by Roman
Catholic philosophy and that the DLP
has a Roman Catholic base. They feel
themselves entitled (and again I agree
to their entitlement) to describe mem-
bers of the Holt Government as “jack-
boot boys” (that is, potential Fascists)
and to accuse the Government or at
least some of its supporters of follow-
ing policies that will extinguish liberty
in Australia. They do not even limit
their accusations to those who are
active participants on the political
scene. I have known Archbishop
Gough, when he was Archbishop of
Sydney, described as a greater threat
to Australian liberty than the Com-
munists. Where I disagree with them
is that they are not prepared to accord
the same liberty to others. If they
accuse somebody as a threat to liberty
they see that as “historically accu-
rate.” If someone points out how
their policies are assisting the cause of
Communism that is a “smear.”
They deny to others a liberty that
they demand for themselves. Whatever'
the outcome of the Capricornia election
Everingham... in the religion row
I think that McMahon was entitled to
try to establish for the benefit of Capri-
cornian voters which Wing of the ALP
Everingham belongs to. Part of the
discussion between the Wings is their
opposed attitudes to Communism.
One Wing (to which the question
from “Discussion” produced by Mc-
Mahon shows Everingham may belong)
views Communism as a slightly hereti-
cal regrettable grouping of a section
of the Labor Movement. This group
does not view Communism as an
authoritarian ideology as remote from
Labor as Nazism and Fascism. Its
intellectual approach was probably best
summed up by Dr. Jim Cairns, Lab.,
Vic., when he wrote in the 1964 spring-
issue of the radical journal “Dissent”:
“We (Labor) are situated in the politi-
cal spectrum next to the Communists
and they will stand for many things
for which we stand.”
The opposed Labor Wing views Com-
munism as an authoritarian political
system. This Wing’s attitude is prob-
ably best summed up in the words of
the late Dr. Evatt in the House of Rep-
resentatives on April 17, 1958: “The
objection of Labor to Communism be-
gins with the fact that the Communist
Party believes in a totalitarian form
of Government . . . Communist Govern-
ments resemble Fascist Governments.”
And more recently in the declaration
of the ALP Federal Secretary, Mr.
C. S. Wyndham, that between the
Labor Party and the Communist Party
there is “an unbridgeable gulf.”
From a Labor parliamentarian’s atti-
tude towards Communism and whether
he views it as something alongside
which he stands in the political spec-
trum, or a totalitarian blueprint for Gov-
ernment, flows inevitable by-products.
It decides Labor attitudes toward ex-
ternal affairs policies. It can produce the
contradiction of the Leftists on one
hand demanding the use of force
against authoritarian regimes (such as
the Smith regime in Rhodesia), and on
the other hand pleading for peace in
Vietnam, even if the only terms on
which peace can be secured almost
certainly mean the extension of Com-
munism in South-East Asia. It can pro-
duce the situation in which the Federal
ALP ban on unity tickets between Com-
munist and ALP members in trade
union elections is opposed and thwarted.
It could produce a situation in which
despite the late Dr. Evatt’s definition
and Wyndham’s “unbridgeable gulf” a
united front between the ALP and the
Communist Party can come about
(Everingham has suggested such a
situation).
Against this background McMahon
made the statement which put Evering-
ham’s views, as set out by Everingham
himself, and which included Evering-
ham’s references to his agnosticism or
atheism.
In condemning McMahon for includ-
ing the reference to Everingham’s beliefs
the ALP is trying to deny McMahon a
liberty of comment that the Leftists
within the ALP demand for themselves.

Alcan adds ideas to
aluminium to make
building sheet that's
thicker,wider,stionger r
cooler...and warmer.
Under a roof of Alcan's aluminium building sheet this summer, you'll find
yourself up to fifteen degrees cooler. (Come winter, you'll find it about
fifteen degrees more snug.) Yet at Alcan, we think of this insulation simply
as a side benefit. It's something you get, knowing you've got a roof that'll
last a lifetime without maintenance. Patent weatherproof sidelap design;
distinctively embossed pattern; wider sheets for faster work. This is Alcan
building sheet; good for homes because it lasts a lifetime. Good for weekend
handyman jobs because it's easier to work with.
THE ALCAN ACE-SPEEDLINE RAINWATER SYSTEM. More efficient pipes
and guttering that don't need maintenance. Easier to install (you could do it
yourself). Compatible with any kind of roof. Ask about them.

AUSTRALIA
Crossing a sea of troubles to
maintain the migrant flow
A DEADLOCK AT the talks in Can-
berra last week aimed at finalising a
new immigration agreement with Italy
has highlighted the difficulties Australia
is facing in maintaining its present
migration program. Immigration last
financial year fell more than 9000 short
of the 148,000 target and prospects for
the current year are even gloomier.
Applications to migrate from Britain
fell drastically early this year and
Australian officials are prepared for an
overall fall of 15,000 in the expected
70,000 assisted migrants from Britain.
If Australia is to achieve its migra-
tion target this year again 148,000
it must find some 37,000 additional
migrants from sources outside Britain.
Immigration Minister Snedden and his
departmental officers have tackled this
challenge with enterprise.
In a swing through Europe and the
Middle East earlier this year, Snedden
tapped a new source for migrants, Tur-
key. If current negotiations with Turkey
are successful, and immigration officials
say they are now well advanced, it will
mean the first large-scale non-Christian
migration to Australia.
Snedden has also come up with two
new ideas. The first is to “snare” foreign
workers in northern European countries
and get them to Australia under a
special passage-assistance program
which costs the migrant only $25. This
scheme produced 6000 migrants last
year, but the Department has now bol-
stered its posts in Germany, France,
Sweden, and Denmark and is aiming at
17,000 this year.
The second idea is the more contro-
versial. The Immigration Department—
subject to Cabinet approval—is aiming
at an agreement with Yugoslavia (the
first such with a Communist country) to
bring assisted migrants to Australia.
But a large part of Australia’s hopes
of finding the extra 37,000 migrants to
make up the target rested on getting a
new immigration agreement with Italy.
Snedden and the Italian Under-
secretary of Foreign Affairs, Senator
Oliva, have agreed to a second meeting
this week in the hope of coming to
some concrete arrangement before the
Italian President arrives in Australia
later this month.
The Italians are demanding conces-
sions for their migrants (including the
right to old-age pensions even if they
return to Italy), that the Australian
Government is not prepared to grant to
its own citizens. They have won in-
creased recognition for Italian profes-
sional qualifications and are also de-
manding better housing arrangements.
This all adds up to increased cost for
Australia. But the Italian Government,
like other migrant source Governments,
now has the whip hand. If Australia
wants to maintain the flow of migrants
from overseas we will have to continue
to cross our own sea of troubles to
get them.
Snedden (r.) and Oliva ... meeting
Qantas
Pilots' contract
A CASUAL STATEMENT at a dinner
one night last week indicated that
Qantas’ years of troubles with its pilots
were over. Later, guarded comments
from both sides seemed to suggest that
neither had really won.
Qantas couldn’t quite believe it was
all over. Their spokesman said, “The
agreement looks like being signed, and
minor details are being tidied up, but
these sometimes develop into major
issues.”
“It’s a very good contract for both
parties,” said the retiring president of
the Australian Federation of Air Pilots,
Captain R. T. Holt. “I am very happy
to go out on this note. My successor,
Captain David Brown, should not have
so many confrontations.”
The impression gained from talking
to Qantas was that the pilots had won
the dispute which culminated in a 27-
Captain Holt (r.) ... very happy
day strike last December and cost
Qantas a net $8 million, resulting in an
operating deficit for the airline of $1.5
million in 1966-67. But Captain Holt
felt there had been a lot of give and
take on both sides.
As Qantas reviewed the struggle, the
pilots called the strike on operational
matters, but then switched round to
money demands.
Negotiations with management, which
began on March 13, covered operational
matters (working hours and standards)
and the industrial area (pay and con-
ditions).
Qantas formally agreed to examine a
comprehensive contract (of the North
American type) but “w'ould not buy it
sight unseen.” The aii'line is now sign-
ing a highly documented, sophisticated
agreement about hours and conditions
which is “broadly the same as the North
American contract squeezed out of the
domestics. Ansett caved in and TAA
followed suit in July last year, leading
to pressure on Qantas” was how a
Qantas man put it. But Captain Holt
thinks Qantas has a better contract than
the domestic airlines.
On the industrial side, the contract
sets a base figure for a unit of work,
with multiples, fractions, and extensions,
depending on what routes are flown,
whether it is day or night flying, and
so on. It is now a matter of arithmetic,
which may need a computer. The
pilots will then know their schedules
for up to a year ahead, and the contract
incorporates the principle of seniority
and a bidding system. (As some routes
are more lucrative to pilots than others,
they can bid for them on the basis of
seniority.)
Having spent more time on industrial
matters than any other single item,
Qantas looks forward to concentrating
on running an air service. With some
satisfaction, their spokesman said,
“Qantas lost no pilots over the strike.
They all want to work for us.”


Development
Rival banks
THERE WAS SOMETHING inevit-
able about last week’s acid response
of Trade Minister McEwen to the news
of Treasurer McMahon’s new bank to
finance development of Australia’s
national resources and so reduce the
speed with which Australia’s major re-
sources projects are falling under
foreign control.
For there is no doubt that Mc-
Mahon’s bank has taken a fair bit of
the steam out of McEwen’s rival pro-
posal for a National Development
Corporation. This corporation, which
McEwen outlined last March, was de-
signed to raise long-term borrowings
overseas to finance developments of
local resources, leaving the equity in
Australian hands. At that time the
Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, had quite
clearly distinguished between the two
schemes being fostered by his Trade
Minister and his Treasurer.
They were, said Mr. Holt, “separate
shows.” McMahon’s would be a capital
fund raised by the trading banks to
mobilise money available within Aus-
tralia; McEwen’s would be looking
mainly to overseas capital. The PM
said that foreign money would not be a
substantial part of the financing of
McMahon’s bank and that any funds
raised overseas would probably be
short-term. And he added that Mc-
Mahon’s bank went “a little further
than a refinancing operation.”
Well, now it goes a lot further than
a refinancing operation, with direct in-
vestment in projects being stressed as
one of its functions. And there seems
far more importance placed on over-
seas borrowing than before.
So last week Mr. McEwen greeted
the new bank with the remark that it
had been ‘importantly renamed” and
its functions redesigned “clearly to meet
purposes not originally intended.” He
Treasurer and Trade Minister... lines
welcomed this much broader approach
to making finance available for Aus-
tralian development “along the lines
I had expressed the necessity for.”
Mr. McMahon countered briefly
along the lines that it was the same
bank as the one proposed earlier.
But if Mr. McEwen has been vic-
torious in getting some of his prin-
ciples put into practice in the rival
bank, it means that his own project
may have little chance of getting off
the ground. Last week Mr. Holt said
that no decision had yet been made
by Federal Cabinet on the McEwen
plan.
America’s Cup
Next time
IT WAS AFTER THE second race
against Intrepid that Dame Pattie’s crew
quietly removed their wind totem. This
news must have failed to reach the
Mornington Peninsula where well-
meaning Aborigines have been holding
corroborees to gain fair breezes for the
America’s Cup challenger, because next
day the northerly howled through
her rigging, and she lost again.
Superstitious sailors could have told
the Dame Pattie men that removing
a charm would not improve things, and
it didn’t. Hurricane Dora with winds
of 80 miles an hour brushed by, while
300 miles away her sister storm Chloe
eyed Newport ominously. And at the
time, although wind was something
that the Dame did not want, the
indicator atop her 90-foot mast spun
dizzily. Anything above 15 knots was
clearly Intrepid weather, Mosbacher
weather, anybody’s but Australia’s.
The American defender had lived
up to her advance billing, she was the
Flying I, the superboat, the ghost ship,
and looked unbeatable by the chal-
lenger, or for that matter, any other
12-metre yacht in the world today.
Revolutionary, she was a breakthrough
in design in a class of thoroughbred
racing machines it would have seemed
impossible to improve upon. What,
then, were the lessons to be learned
from our million-dollar venture?
In simplest terms, three races indi-
cated Dame Pattie was not fast enough.
Warwick Hood’s hull design was mag-
nificent, but it was 18 months older
than the radical’s. Next time, we should
perhaps campaign our crew on one 12-
metre and leave the challenger on the
drawing-board and in the test tank
until the last possible moment, for
improvements can always be made.
Next time, too, we must have a
better workhorse than Nefertiti, and a
top-class helmsman and crew to drill
our challenge crew to match perfection,
in much the way wily disciplinarian
Harry Hopman sends us into the Davis
Cup. Next time it must be more of a
national effort unless we can find a
patriot who can write an open cheque
that would shake the Reserve Bank.
Dame Pattie’s generous sponsors still
had to watch the pennies while In-
trepid’s syndicate obviously had
heeded doyen Harold Vanderbilt’s
often-quoted “if you have to ask what
it costs, you can’t afford it.” The Dame
was great, but in Australia we had
resources, financial and technological,
which were untapped.
Finally, watching from the sidelines,
what were the French doing? “Ah,”
said Baron Bick, president of the French
America’s Cup Association, “we shall
buy Intrepid if they will sell her. She
would be useful.” And the New York
Yacht Club? A new defender of the
116-year-old Holy Grail of yachting was
already being ordered.
Papua-New Guinea
Political talent
SHARPENING NIPS FROM the local
Press are likely to be the lot of Aus-
tralian Territories Ministers visiting
Papua-New Guinea over the next few
years as democracy is reared from a
pup; the more so as the Minister does
his job and makes frequent appear-
ances, offering necessary comments or
answering questions on policy and in-
tentions. The present Minister, Mr.
Barnes, who does all these things, is
beginning to know the pattern well.
But last week’s nips he must have
felt the more keenly because some of
them came from behind; from Brisbane,
which regards the Territories as within
its sphere of interest if not influence,
just as Perth takes more notice of events
in Indonesia and even Africa than East-
erners do.
Brisbane “Courier Mail” took Mr.
Barnes gently to task for his latest pro-
nouncement, in Port Moresby, that
Australia’s traditional preference for
Public Servants to stay out of politics
would be applied to Papua-New Guinea;
reluctantly, by legislation if necessary.
The editorial made these incisive
points: it would be dangerous if the
Territories’ political development was
met with Australian bans; there was not
a wealth of talent outside the Public
Service from which to draw politicans;
and we could not expect democracy in
New Guinea to grow as pure Australia-
style democracy, or we would come to
disaster.
As though to underline all this, Pro-
fessor S. Encel, in a recent issue of the
University of N.S.W. student newspaper
“Tharunka,” suggested that Papua-New
Guinea’s infant democracy might be in
its most serious danger if, by default,
the military should become the only
elite as in many emergent African
nations available as the only alterna-
tive government.


Sydney
Civic upheaval
THE N.S.W. GOVERNMENT last
week announced plans to reorganise
Sydney’s city boundaries. The Labor-
dominated City Council has been
a thorn in the side of the Askin Gov-
ernment and friction between the State
and the local administration of its
capital has been a continued character-
istic of Sydney’s politics. While the
move seems primarily aimed at break-
ing Labor’s hold in the city area, the
proposed relocation of boundaries does
have practical foundations.
In 1948 the then Labor State Gov-
ernment legislated to extend the bound-
aries of the Sydney City Council to
include eight inner suburbs, all tradi-
tional Labor strongholds. These acqui-
sitions transformed the Council’s area
of control from an already extensive
one into a domain of enormous pro-
portions. The municipality included
everything from docks and heavy indus-
try to slums.
When it came to power in 1965, one
of the first Bills the Liberal Government
sought to bring down was aimed at
an almost identical cut in the Council’s
area, as detailed in the present pro-
posal. At that time Labor still held a
majority in the Upper House and the
move had to be postponed.
Now, with a Liberal-Country Party
majority in both Houses, the Bill seems
sure to come into effect by the end of
the year.
Under the new boundary arrange-
ment, three areas would go to existing
suburban councils, and the large in-
dustrial and residential group of Dari-
ington, Redfern, Watei'loo, Zetland,
Alexandria, Erskineville, and Rosebery
will be lumped together in a new
municipality to be known as Northcott
named after a past State Governor.
While electoral rolls are being drawn
up, a three-man Commission will take
over the city administration. Although
parliament has not yet named the trio,
Messrs. J. A. Shaw (recently retired
Commissioner for Main Roads), W. W.
Pettingell (managing director of the
Australian Gas Light Company), and
the Chairman of the Local Government
Boundaries Commission, V. H. Treatt,
are tipped as the interim administrators.
This may seem hard luck for Syd-
ney’s Lord Mayor, Alderman (and ex-
Senator) John Armstrong, who is said
to have achieved a lifelong “Dick Whit-
tington” ambition in assuming the robes
of his current office, and who has been
seen as a hard-working incumbent.
Universal franchise notwithstanding,
the Government’s apparent belief that
the old boundaries will contain too few
Labor voters to return another Labor-
dominated City Council to the Town
Hall chamber may deny Alderman Arm-
strong’s possible desire to be thrice
Lord Mayor of Sydney. An innovation,
the next LM would be elected by his
council, not by direct popular vote.
However, Alderman Armstrong is not
being easily put down but is going to
fight to retain “greater” Sydney against
those who would trim its Council’s size,
wealth, and influence.
This week the gloves will be off.
Local Government Minister Morton
will lead with a detailed Bill in the
N.S.W. Parliament. And on Friday of
this week the Lord Mayor has invited
Sydney to the Town Hall “to be in-
formed of all the implications of the
proposed Government scheme.”
One implication is that the proposed
new boixndaries for the Sydney City
Council go out of the way to include
the grounds of Sydney University. It
seems that !no amount of legislative zeal
can remove Sydney’s determination to
stay a University city.

Tasmania
Power crisis
THE MOST NOTABLE item in the
September Budget of Tasmanian
Premier Reece, from the viewpoint of
“mainlanders,” was $2.85 million for the
Hydro Electric Commission to spend on
supplementary power plant. After many
years of vaunted water-power, nature
has not only let Tasmania down badly
but has done so at the worst time, when
promising new industries were coming
in. Immediate result, blocks of bulk
power promised to Comalco and the
Savage River project have been deferred
for three months.
At the same time power supplies to
all bulk users are to be cut by 20 per-
cent for at least nine months. This is
expected to reduce HEC revenue about
$l-| million. To offset it, prices to retail
consumers are to be increased an
average of 74 percent, from October 1
until further notice.
Tasmania has had a long dry. During
the three months in which the Hobart
district fires occurred rainfall was down
to about 60 percent of the long-term
average, and by May this had fallen to
less than 40 percent. As a result, the
electrical energy capacity of the HEC’s
storages has fallen gradually to a present
20 percent of the “norm.” Recent rains
in the north and north-east of Tasmania
have not replenished the central high-
lands catchment areas.
These hard facts have forced the
Commission to scramble for emergency
generating plant. Agents are negotiating
for two or more gas turbine units from
Britain’s Central Electricity Generating
Board, which had ordered them for its
own use and would release them to help
Tasmania. The search for other similar
units is going on throughout the world,
but none small, powerful, and quick to
instal has been found.
One possibility is a New Zealand
ship, the Hinemoa, built in 1946 by
Vickers Armstrong, in Barrow, as an
inter-island ferry. She is equipped with
two steam turbines with an output of
5120 k.w., connected to two electric
motors each of 5000 h.p.
It might be anchored in the river
Tamar close to the site of the George
Town thermal power station. As well
as pumping 10,000 k.w. into the State
electricity grid, the Hinemoa could also
serve to accommodate the work force
for the thermal project.
Industries have been asked to use
their own auxiliary plants as much as
possible during the crisis. The Mt.
Lyell Company is buying three oil-
powered alternators and other equip-
ment from the Victorian SEC, with a
capacity of 2500 k.w.
In an every-little-helps mood, Tas-
mania has introduced Daylight Saving.
Over six months this would save about
10 million k.w. hours of electricity, a
very fractional help.
All this, of course, is the background

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
for the Government’s determination to
go ahead with its Gordon River project,
against the cries of conservationists.
Because industry needs power, and won’t
come where it is in desperately short
supply, Tasmania feels it has to stake
the possible reduction of scenic beauty
against ability to promise ample power
in the future—water power, thermal,
power from anything that will generate.
The teaser question for both Labor
Government and Liberal Opposition in
Tasmania is: how much political power
will be gained or lost, and by whom,
during the crisis.
Wool
No mixture
BRUCK MILLS, industrial mainstay
of Wangaratta, in the rich sheep coun-
try of North Eastern Victoria, boasts
rightly of its versatility. It uses 250
to 300 different types of yarn, both
filament and staple, consisting of 20
fibres from Australia, America, Canada,
Japan, England, Ireland, Switzerland,
and Holland. Most of these fibres are
man-made.
Arnold Piesse, Bruck’s manufacturing
manager, says “We would use wool,
but no one comes to sell it to us.”
Bruck’s existing looms could handle
wool mixtures, but the Australian Wool
Board is promoting pure wool not mix-
tures, and this is the rigid attitude of
the whole wool trade. The wool boys
look on Bruck as a competitor instead
of a potential customer.
Only other major industry in the
town is the spinner Wangaratta Wool-
len Mills, just a stone’s throw away.
Come in, spinners.
Sport
Athletics first
THE RUGBY LEAGUE States have
ended their season, the Australian Foot-
ball ones are approaching the delerious
finales of theirs, mostly at grounds
bursting their outer walls. The crunch
may be at its worst in Perth, where
there a paradox has given Soccer a
strange advantage.
Next Saturday, while more than
40,000 Australian Football barrackers
at Perth Oval jostle each other at a
semi-final match, a few hundred Soccer
followers a mile or so away will sprawl
in comfort at Perry Lakes Stadium,
Western Australia’s most opulent white
elephant.
The stadium was built for the Com-
monwealth Games of 1962, and since
then athletics and football have fought
bitterly over its future. The general feel-
ing has been that when the tumult dies,
Australian Rules will take over. Only
about one-sixth of the annual stadium
outlay of more than $40,000 is coming
back to Perth City Council, and only
the Australian Football industry could
bring in the kind of money needed to
put the stadium in the black.
But despite the economics, it is most
unlikely that footballers will get to sink-
ing their studs into the Stadium’s even
turf; the City Council aims to maintain
the athletes’ grip.
Perry Lakes holds 32,000 seated, and
this capacity could easily be increased;
although for winter sports the seating
would have to be amended to save fans
from being washed by the seat of their
pants on to the arena. The pavilion is
magnificent inside, several storeys high,
with all kinds of rooms and halls that
seldom get used.
The Stadium was conceived in an
era when Perth’s Herb Elliott became
one of the first amateurs to push foot-
ballers from their pedestal of glory.
After years of asking, the running
fraternity were given what they sought,
and more, with the ultimate aim of
fostering national and international
competition.
Football and athletics are incompat-
ible at Perry Lakes. To make an Aus-
tralian Rules ground, some seating
would have to be removed and, more
important, the cinders track, which is
“still maturing like a good wine” accord-
ing to the athletes, would have to be
ripped up. No top-class athletics would
be possible without the track; no foot-
ball can be played with it. Football ad-
ministrators say they would be willing
to put up $400,000 to get a new cinders
track on the adjacent warm-up area,
but the W.A. Amateur Athletics Associa-
tion will not discuss this with the W.A.
National Football League.
The extent of the gulf between the
two bodies of opinion was seen when,
after a year of deferments and then the
longest debate in council history, Perth
City Council rejected a motion 13-11
to block completely any negotiation
between themselves and football’s ad-
ministration. This “victory” did nothing
to ease the deadlock, and while West
Perth and Claremont football clubs have
an eye on Perry Lakes, their League is
planning new headquarters elsewhere.
Australian football is badly catered for
in Perth compared with Melbourne,
Adelaide, and Hobart; two of the eight
clubs do not even have grandstands.
Perry Lakes stadium stands in the
upper-middle-crust Floreat Park, beau-
tifully set among lakes in the city’s
green belt. While the residents are glad
football has not moved in on them, the
money drain dictated that such un-
Floreat Park activities as pro wrestling,
band contests even the roller game
ruin their sleep. The problem will grow
this summer when 150 ft. spotlight towers
are set up above the stadium to cater
for night sport.


Queensland
Civil liberties
FOR SOME TIME, Brisbane’s academ-
ically-orientated angry young people
considered they had a democratic axe
to grind, and on Friday, September 8,
they finally applied it to the stone —
with a shower of sparks in all direc-
tions.
It was a day on which the Queens-
land University based Civil Liberties
Co-ordinating Committee simultane-
ously gained ground and lost face:
gained ground because it showed quite
clearly that a peaceful demonstration
provokes the Queensland Police Force
into a response that could not under
any circumstances be considered desir-
able; and lost face because it disrupted
the peaceful existence of the man in
the street by trying to protect him from
an evil which might never come within
his sphere of reference.
The students first planned their
march in protest against laws demand-
ing 14 days’ notice, a permit, and $1
fee for every banner carried. They had
Students begin their march
made submissions to Premier Nicklin,
but were dissatisfied with his response.
The University Union was against
a protest march without a permit. The
Civil Liberties committee was against
accepting a last-minute permit. Finally
the permit was returned to the Traffic
Superintendent, and the march from
St. Lucia to the city began for 3500
demonstrators.
The students, six abreast, moved off
in a column almost a mile long. They
covered the five miles to the city with-
out incident. Police lined the route, but
did not attempt to stop the march.
One student had equipped himself
with a pith helmet, flying goggles, and
a cane. Others posed as a group of
AWU members with a placard and
garb to match. At that stage demon-
strators were not aware of the fact
that a few of their gaily attired num-
ber were members of the police force
wolves putting up an effectively
sheepish front.
It was not until the column reached
the city and the extent of the per-
mit which had been issued that
the trouble started. Demonstrators
were warned to turn back. They didn’t.
Instead, they sat down where they
were in Roma Street and linked
arms. This was what the 250 police
standing by were waiting for. They
charged.
The demonstrators just sat, and the
police came in swinging, kicking, and
picking up students from the roadway
to throw them on to the footpath.
March leader and retiring University
Union president, Frank Gardiner
an ex-Navy pilot who has devoted most
of his year in office to tidying up the
students’ public image was one of
the first to be dragged off to one of
the several waiting paddy wagons.
Gardiner was soundly beaten in the
process, and later received medical
attention. At no stage did he retaliate.
Brian Laver perhaps the most color-
ful of the student leaders was also
arrested.
Three bulky policemen picked up
one young girl by the arms and legs
and walked off in different directions.
The girl fainted. Two of the girls
arrested were 'moved from the Watch
House to the Royal Brisbane Hospital
that night.
One of the few students to retaliate
to the rough-house police tactics was
a six-foot member of the varsity judo
club a black-belt holder. He was
kicked in the ribs as he sat on the
road, and he saw red. He had dumped
four policemen heavily on to various
corners of the battleground before he
was finally overpowered.
An enthusiastic barracker for the
demonstrators was using crutches.
These were neatly swept out from
under him by a policeman. He became
less enthusiastic.
The morning after the demonstration,
124 charges against 120 of the marchers
were given their first hearing in the
Magistrate’s Court. Nearly 60 failed to
appear and forfeited bail. Ten of those
charged were University staff members.
A group of students who attended
last Tuesday’s State Parliament sitting
heard Mr. Nicklin gloss over the whole
affair with a solemn warning that
students “can only expect to be pun-
ished” if they break the State laws.
“The police are there for the overall
protection and good of the public,” he
said. “They showed extreme restraint
and handled themselves with credit in
the face of a very difficult situation.”
Mr. Nicklin quoted from a report
from the Traffic Superintendent (In-
spector Hughes) which said: “At no
time did I observe police using un-
necessary force in order to make an
arrest.”
On Wednesday morning, the matter
again came before Parliament when
Mr. Nicklin and Education Minister
Pizzey were faced with questions on
notice. Neither got their teeth into
the real issues. Mr. Pizzey told the
House that he had no knowledge of any
writs having been issued against police
officers involved in the Friday fun. He
said that police had been instructed to
“use restraint and be tolerant” with
student demonstrators.
Mr. Nicklin and his cabinet were
making it quite clear that the student
action didn’t excite them too much. But
at the same time, union leaders began
making it just as clear that they wanted
a slice of the students’ cause.
The Queensland Trades and Labor
Council “requested” the 60,000-odd
members of their 38 affiliated unions to
stop work at noon on Thursday. Mem-
bers were asked to attend a union-
organised mass public protest meeting
over the civil liberties issue in King
George Square from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Only about 3000 people - and not
all of them unionists attended the
meeting. Some saw this as a disappoint-
ing figure, but the mass meeting was
still the biggest held in the city’s King
George Square for many years. Also,
it kept the issue well and truly alive,
and brought it within the direct refer-
ence of more of the community.
This meeting was orderly. With the
exception of an umbrella-wielding
Police end it forcefully
woman who repeatedly informed the
gathering that they were “all Commos,”
people listened quietly to eight speakers
including the TLC president, Mr. Eger-
ton, Frank Gardiner, and two Univer-
sity staff members. The meeting closed
when a resolution opposing civil liber-
ties’ restrictions was carried with a
roar of approval.
On Friday, students bought solidly
back into the dispute with yet another
mass meeting in the Square, organised
by the University Union. Two thousand
of them gathered to listen to speakers.
This meeting, too, was peaceful, as it
had been legalised by a permit issued
by police on Thursday afternoon.
And so the week which began with
that initial undergraduate axe-grinding
had come to an end. Those involved
had more than made their presence felt
—they had inspired some thousands of
others to follow suit.




WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE EDUCATED WOMAN?
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE EDUCATED WOMAN?
By APRIL HERSEY
A STATION WAGON pulls up in a
flurry of gravel in a neat suburban
driveway in St. Ives, on Sydney’s North
Shore, and a rather anxious man
hurries into his home. His wife is
already dressed to go out. She is im-
patient. It is his turn to mind the
young children, having left his business
for two hours while he does so, and her
turn to rush off to an art class at Crows
Nest. Though he is late getting to her,
she manages not to be annoyed, leaves
him instructions about the baby, liter-
ally withdraws her skirt from her young
child’s clinging fingers, and takes over
the wheel of the car.
She is driving toward a mediocre
teacher. She is not very interested in
art. She is never going to be a success-
ful painter. In fact she is never even
going to bring one of her paintings
home. If she is asked why she goes
through this insane pantomime once a
week, she will tell you seriously that
she needs to do it, that this is an outlet
for her creativity, that she has to do
something cultural, has to be with
people, away from her own children
and her friends who also have children.
And perhaps she is right.
She is probably a highly intelligent
woman in her early thirties, well
educated, though not necessarily a
graduate from a university, who has
realised once her life became bounded
by the perimeter of a toddler’s vision
that she must not let herself rust away.
Certainly the woods about St. Ives,
the hills around Melbourne, the tropical
suburbs of Brisbane, and the terraces
of Adelaide are filled with women just
like her, educated, interested, longing
to do something constructive, but this
often, in turn, becomes time-consuming
activities which they know in their
hearts mean very little.
“I’ve done everything,” one woman
said bitterly. “I’ve learnt dress-
designing, studied jazz, joined discus-
sion groups about everything from Eng-
lish literature to economics. I’ve done
the Japanese flower-arranging course.,
I’ve studied yoga. I’m a great cook
if you like exotic food. I’m an expres-
sive dancer with very thick thighs who’ll
certainly never appear on a stage. I’m
an abstract painter with far more equip-
ment than talent, and I can make my
own jewellery. I even have a certificate
from Melbourne to prove I’m a writer.
I’d be an absolute treasure on a desert
island. Sometimes I think it would be
a lot more fun to have a lover, and
probably much less expensive.”
But for the most part they are a
faithful, lonely group, isolated in
suburbia, trapped in a world of press-
button inefficiency since it only pro-
vides endless time which is never pri-
vate unless the children are at school
or asleep. “I wait for my little boy to
take his afternoon nap like someone
who looks for an oasis in a desert. Then,
so often, I’m so damned tired I fall
asleep myself,” one young wife said.
“At night, when I should be able
to read and work, do all these marvel-
lous things, I am hypnotised by a sort
of end-of-day apathy and find myself
watching television, or knitting. It’s
infuriating. Sometimes I remember all
the glowing comments I used to find
on my essays at university. And I think
this neat little house must be some kind
of a joke. But it’s a joke I have played
on myself. I love my home. I love my
husband and children. But what has
happened to me ?”
This awful sense of limbo is a prime
cause for drug-taking and even
attempted suicide among educated Aus-
tralian women. The graduates are not
the only ones who down headache
powders to danger point and lean on
tranquillisers and sleeping tablets to
help them through, but as one psychia-
trist pointed out, “They are more sensi-
tive people and they feel every bump
in the road. And what is rather sad
about it all is that when they come
to me for help they already know what
is wrong. They are aware of threaten-
ing depression, but they are no more
able to avoid it than anyone else.
Activity helps.”
But depression creeps through those
pretty little gardens like smog. A survey
worker noticed that she was an event
in the streets of suburbia. “I felt the
hands itching to drag me inside because
I was someone who could talk. It’s
rather frightening. They feel so cut off
from what is going on. The houses are
so often clean to the point of madness
or else untidy and uncared for and I
am offered a drink of scotch at 10
a.m. It’s beginning to turn me into an
old maid. Now and then you find some
cheerful soul making pottery in her
kitchen or sowing away, but she is the
exception.”
That the young child needs its parent
is irrefutable, and the woman who leaves
her young babies in the care of even the
most experienced hands may miss a
great deal.
Breeding in the suburbs and in the
country is certainly necessary if Aus-
tralia’s natural population is to increase
at a satisfactory level, but it is not
much fun for the displaced intellectuals.
Perhaps it is because there is no escape
from the nursery and the student’s eager
stride is slowed down to the pace of
first walkers that Australian women are
impressing the whole world with their
devotion to the Pill.
When you pause to consider how
many more young women now at school
or at the universities are firmly plan-
ning a lifetime career with children as
a very secondary consideration, the
intelligent children of intelligent parents
must grow fewer and may fade com-
pletely from the Australian scene.
One mother of four told me she
wept her way through Betty Frieden’s
“Feminine Mystique,” taking it all as
gospel and very much to heart. An Arts
graduate and a brilliant research
student before marriage, she was swept
hysterically into a sudden commitment
to teaching. “It was quite ridiculous,”
she said. “Like hypnotism.”
But when she announced her decision
to her ten-year-old son he was appalled:
“Mum!” he said. “You couldn’t. What
on earth would you say to the class?
Look, you couldn’t be a teacher!”
“I realised,” she said, “in one awful,
enlightening moment how much of a
nothing I had become.” She didn’t
become a teacher, but quietly returned
to research and engaged a housekeeper.
She is typical of thousands of edu-
cated women now stirring restlessly in
Australia’s affluence. The situation of
“arts and matrimony” has proved too
dull to be borne by many.
But everyone cannot return to work
even with the help of a housekeeper.
Previous generations were educated in
an entirely different way and they are
not so readily employable as Governor-
General Lord Casey seems to imagine.
He urged all those without serious com-
mitments to get back to work when he
spoke on Australia Day last January.
What he forgets is that these intelligent
women were educated to be pleasant
companions and not specifically for any
real occupation other than teaching.
Among women graduates who have
retired into the mists of family life, the
majority, questioned in a study by
Madge Dawson for her book “Graduate
and Married,” felt and, in fact, knew
that they needed additional training
before they could return to active par-
ticipation, despite the present shortage
of teachers, research workers, and other
skilled people.
Although already 24 percent of homes
in Sydney, according to a survey con-
ducted by Professor H. R. Edwards,
head of the School of Economic and
Financial Studies at Macquarie Uni-
versity, have a secondary wage packet
provided by the wife, this is not the
picture throughout Australia. And the
24 percent undoubtedly includes a large
percentage of the traditional working-
class women who have worked at un-
skilled jobs in all countries at all times.
Macquarie University, opening as it
did in the “off year” before the Wynd-
ham scheme unleashed its wave of
“broadly educated” eighteen-year-olds
into university life, provided a sort of
lifeline for the North Shore of Sydney,
and, though figures are not available
or no one wants to make figures avail-
able, it is pretty obvious that about
100 or more of the 300-odd day students
at present at the university are women
with families or older women who are
returning to the land of the living.
There is always a percentage of
older men and women at universities,
but the natural tension involved in
being a generation or more ahead of
the main bulk of the student population
has held many women back from
applying to Australian universities. At
Macquarie, rootless and without estab-
lished traditions, still amid the hammer-
ing and building and the planting of
trees, the women applied and were
accepted, and they are very happy.
They have done very well and in
some cases have outdistanced much
younger students. But though a few
have definite plans to do “something”
with their degrees when they achieve
them, to many the university seems to
be an end in itself and not a means to
an end.
Mrs. Norma Hayman, . a Common-
wealth Scholar who is studying English,
Macquarie University... a lifeline for
older students
has been the main force behind estab-
lishing a creche within the grounds of
the university. With the help of the
Macquarie University provisional Apex
Club (surely another first in university
life) a pleasant cottage has been set
aside for the future child-minding
centre.
The Vice-Chancellor, Professor A. G.
Mitchell, is very interested in the
scheme. “They don’t have full per-
mission yet, of course,” he said. “They
have yet to prove to us that they can
establish it, staff it, and keep it going.
It just isn’t possible for university funds
to be used for a minority. They are
a minority. They may not seem it
now, but next year we will have a full
load of school-leavers qualifying for the
university and the older students will
become less evident.”
So the Year of the Mums is drawing
to an end and it will be interesting
to see how many continue and how
many more apply next year, since there
are no barriers against them.
“Admission to the university in its
developing years will be in strict order
of educational ability. It is possible
to assess the ability of older students
on their original marks at Leaving
Certificate time no matter when they
sat for the examination. Also they can
study privately to come up to the
required standards. There are many
ways to get to a university. Provisional
passes are given if it appears that the
person applying has had other types
of training, public service, private teach-
ing. Then it all depends on their
capacity at the university. Most of
them do very well.”
Mitchell feels that the accessibility
of Macquarie University has been in-
strumental in attracting mature women
and also that they have been much more
of an asset than a liability.
“They have proved to have leader-
ship. In fact, I think theirs was the first
society formed at Macquarie.”
He pointed out rather coldly when
I felt that MUMS was not much of a
first society to be formed at a uni-
versity that it stood for Macquarie
University Mothers’ Society.
Mrs. Hayman, busy running her own
life and caring for her two-year-old
Lindy as well as studying, has moments
of doubt that she should ever have be-
come so involved in the creche.
“I wonder if I haven’t brought all
the committee meetings and fund-
raising and tea parties that I was
escaping from in the suburbs into the
university with me. Now that I have
started the idea off I wish I could
step out and that some of the young
students might help out. Because, like
it or not, a lot of them will probably
be married and have children by the
time they leave the university and they
will need a creche and baby-minding
centre.”
Publicity has been showered on the
Mums of Macquarie since the first
mention of their child-minding centre
became known, and much of it has been
a little absurd. They cannot, of course,
take babies to lectures and most of
them are taking only one or two sub-
jects, which means they only have to
arrange for the odd hour or two of
baby-sitting each day. The creche, when
it is operating, will free them for more
time at the library.
They don’t shell peas in the common-
room or discuss the problems of napkin
services. During the combined univer-
sity and school holidays they took the
opportunity to show their youngsters
the university and to stage a working
bee at their future cottage. I caught
up with some of them on the deserted
campus, alternately chasing small chil-
dren, preventing fights breaking out,
and talking about behavioural science,
worrying about getting French tapes
back in time and late essays typed.
Margaret Scrivener, mother of Janet
(6) and Sarah (3), commutes from
Hunter’s Hill (12 minutes door to
door). Four days a week she studies
science, French, statistics, and
psychology.
“I feel like a person again. The first
term was the hardest, but now I’ve
just cut all the clutter out of my life.
I’m not available for luncheons. Though
I had a dinner party the other night.
I haven’t stopped living my other sort
of life. I’ve just taken more on.”
Studying is not new to her, since,
she was a nurse before marriage, but,
like all the returning students, she
found the first essay “hell.”
One woman wrote about 400 pages,
then had to get it down to the required
few thousand words.
Peggy Goldsmith, the mother of
three, Ruth (8), Helen (6), and Bryan
(4), tucked the odd toy into her bag
as she talked about majoring in linguis-
tics after getting her Arts degree.
“Speech therapy is something I can
practise at home,” she said. “One has
to be realistic. And I have seven years
ahead of me here at Macquarie before
I can hang out a shingle.”
Kath Warren, a tall, determined
woman from Denistone East, is the
mother of six: Belinda (12), Chris (10),
Richard (8), David (5), Virginia (3),
and Kendall (11 months). Already a
qualified teacher who plans to return
to work, she feels the opportunity to get
a degree is “too good to miss.”
“I would still teach primary, I think,”
she said. “But I will be so much better
qualified. I think you just have to


decide whether you intend to continue
as a person as well as a mother.”
No one wants his children hurt or
disturbed by having working mothers.
“Our being at university doesn’t hurt
them,” Margaret Scrivener said. “It is
providing a better atmosphere than
anything else we could do. Our homes
are filled with interesting discussions,
books, activity. It can’t do them any-
thing but good.”
Mary Hossack, of Normanhurst, is in
agreement with this. She is an evening
student at Macquarie. “There are a
lot of women at the evening classes. I
don’t have time to get to know them.
We are all so busy.”
This is her second attempt to get a
degree. She decided to wait until her
two older daughters were off her hands
and then found herself with another
child. Now Jaqueline (15) and Kath-
leen (12) keep an eye on the two-year-
old while their mother studies.
She plans to teach or to be a psychol-
ogist. “But at the moment I am just
enjoying it.”
Some of the students are of an older
generation still, those who waited until
their family was “off their hands”
before beginning, and have an en-
thusiasm and conscientiousness which
far outstrips that of the young. One
first-year Arts student at the ANU is 65.
“Have I ‘done well?’ ” she asks. “Not
nearly as well as I hoped to, so far.
I’m very near, if not at, the bottom of
class in one subject I wished to excel
in. Another subject I had to give away
at the end of first term because the gap
between my schooling, which ended
50 years ago, and present knowledge at
matriculation level of mathematics
proved too formidable a barrier to
‘doing well’ in Logic. If only Logic
were not bracketed with Philosophy, in
which I can ‘do’ quite well.
“I find I cannot, at 65, bring to my
studies the open mind of youth and
the same capacity for concentration
which the young have. I cannot, either,
look forward hopefully to using the
knowledge I am gaining to enrich long
years of constructive life ahead. But,
as always, there are compensations. No
other student, I’m sure, has such an
uplifting of the heart at every time of
entering a lecture hall, in browsing in
the library, or simply walking, as a
right, across the campus.”
This student is working her way
through. She was a typist at the ANU
before beginning her course and works
through the May and August vacations.
It was necessary to get the money for
fees and books, although she would have
preferred free time in vacations for
study. It means no new clothes, either,
and very few outings or amusements,
but such privations, she believes, are
trifling in comparison with what she is
gaining.
The joy of perpetual learning is one
that seems to have a grip on many
women. The external students of New
England University seem prepared to
go on indefinitely. Taking only one
subject a year, the courses appear to
stretch from start to infinity.
Desiree McFadden, of Edgecliff, is
doing her course for the “sheer hell of
it.” Already a writer she has six years
to go at the rate of two subjects a
year in the course she has chosen. She
has just as many assignments to do as
the resident students and, in fact, ex-
ternal students of New England are
bound to spend several weeks a year
“in residence.”
This gives them an opportunity to
meet their professors, normally hun-
dreds of miles away, and to engage in
a round of lectures, parties, and in-
dustrious socialising. This emphasis on
going to the university is very strong.
Women in the ninth month of preg-
nancy have been included and have
had to be flown back to the accouche-
ment still clutching the odd canape in
one hand and notes in the other.
“There has to be more incentive than
self-gratification in working for an
external degree. It may be nebulous,
but it has to be strong. Otherwise
it is like promising yourself you will
brush your hair 600 times a night
you just don’t follow through. It’s
just like a job. You leave your desk at
home to prepare the evening meal. If
you are really serious about it,” Mrs.
McFadden said.
This would not suit too many women
because it again places the full
emphasis on the four walls of home. It
is because of this phobia of loneliness
that so many women are trapped into
raising funds for charities, dressing up
for functions, and generally living in a
half world of self-created socialising.
This is what one graduate referred to as
“the social syndrome,” and in a larger
or greater degree it is one of the most
unsatisfying aspects of life in Aus-
tralia for intelligent women.
are the solutions for the
educated woman who, on the one hand,
is trapped in happy enough bondage,
and on the other hand is so desperately
needed in a country short of skilled
brains? Is a. child better off if he is
always cared for by a slightly distraught
mother who consciously or uncon-
sciously blames him for her Alice-
through- the-looking-glass world?
There is no doubt that it takes an
effort of courage to be the only woman
in a suburban street to leave for work
each morning, to be the only mother
who doesn’t do tuck. But this is an effort
which many first-class professional
women, even in Australia, and, par-
ticularly, one must add, New Aus-
tralians, make without much difficulty,
and which more and more women may
cheerfully make.
But many of the answers lie with
employers. Teaching in one form or
another is always available. And now
the computer people are beginning to
need food for their machines so desper-
ately that they are prepared to let
women work at hours that suit them.
Other professions and industries must
eventually follow suit. It is absurd tc
hold fast to the nine-to-five regime,
particularly when so many jobs could
be done at any time.
“If employers offered women decent
hours and decent money and advertised
the fact they would get them. There
would never be any shortage. They all
seem to be so certain we will get preg-
nant,” one woman said. “I feel like
adding the word ‘barren’ to any forms
I have to fill in.”
Though it would appear that the
employer must be prepared to take a
risk on both sexes. If statistics were
worked out, probably as many mature
men succumb to ulcer conditions and
heart attacks as women do to preg-
nancies.
Unless women take the initiative in
fighting for their own working condi-
tions, they will probably always remain
in the intellectual vacuum of suburbia.
Treasurer of the MUMS club, Robert
Mitchell, who is also a lecturer in
economics and statistics at Macquarie,
feels that the Italians have things very
well worked out. “Women are given
time off for pregnancies. There are good
creches everywhere. The economic
world there accepts the fact that a
woman has a brain which is needed,
and, additionally, that she functions as
a woman.
“I don’t think that fitting women
into the economic world is part of the
job of a university. But it is certainly
someone’s job,” he added.
Unfortunately, women are still re-
garded as rather strange beings in many
areas of industry. Though Miss Doreen
Langley, principal of the Women’s.
College within the University of Syd-
ney, feels a decided change is happening
at the young level. “There will be less
prejudice in future,” she said.
“I have a tremendous admiration for
the undergraduate girl of today. She is
very honest. Her whole approach is so
free and frank. She won’t stand
too much prejudice.”
Stewart Armstrong, head of the
School of Engineering and assistant
director of the Institute of Technology,
South Australia, speaking at a seminar
held at the University of New South
Wales on Employment Opportunities
for Women, pointed out that “physic-
ally women are smaller, weaker, have
smaller hearts and brains, and react
more slowly than do men. But they
have the same intelligence, are not
lacking in stamina or courage, and are
clearly at an advantage where space is
at a premium, since the same intelli-
gence and skill can be available in a
smaller form. The male is on an
average 20-25 percent heavier and has
about 10 percent more surface area.”
So, ergonomically speaking, the edu-
cated woman is a much better proposi-
tion. And her surface area is generally
so much more attractive.


MY ADELAIDE
BY GEOFFREY DUTTON
“ Beautification” is all very well, but would that Adelaide had something like King’s Park in Perth
ADELAIDE IS AT HEART a square
city, in every sense of the word,
although its founder, Colonel Light,
who laid it out so rectangular and
solid, was romantic, artistic, irregular,
and radical. He also surrounded it with
a green belt of parks, though in sum-
mer much of the belt is the color of
camel leather, thus helping to give it
that balance between man and nature
which its site and the temperament of
its citizens still preserve. It is a city of
the good life and the golden mean,
between hills that are not high and a
sea that is not rough. No rivers roar
down from Mount Lofty, no surf roars
in on Glenelg. Its light is of a dazzling
purity, free of the humidity and smog
of Sydney. Apart from odd bursts of
bored violence, peace reigns. At the
height of the rush hour in the heart of
the city, if you forget the NO RIGHT
TURN notice and attempt to turn right
in a car, the policeman calls out
“Straight on, sir, please,” instead of
“Can’tyerread, mug?” as in Sydney or
Melbourne. With a couple of discreet
exceptions, no one is very rich, and
although poverty exists, it need not be
an insoluble problem, nor are there, or
have there been, large areas of slums. I
will never forget when as a small boy,
on a black and dripping day, I first
saw Footscray, Carlton, and Fitzroy,
and realised how much a big city’s
slums can rob a man of what I had
innocently always assumed to be his
birthright.
Adelaide is clean, spacious, right-
angled with virtue and equality, but-
tressed (at least in appearance) with
religion, culture, and health. I loved
(and still do) to the north of the city,
and the drive in past the Anglican
Cathedral, up wide King William Street
by the beautiful Adelaide Oval, and
across the Torrens (a lake that looks
like a river except occasionally when
the plug is pulled out), to arrive at the
first intersection at North Terrace, has
always represented to me all the forces:
of order and tradition. Arriving by
train, at the main and very handsome
railway station a few yards down
North Terrace, the end was just the
same, except that as a child it always
seemed to be hotter in the train than
anywhere else, and I was tortured by
a huge poster showing a polar bear
holding up something that looked like
a cooling draught of raspberry balm
with the legend “Bear in Mind
Yalumba Port.” But there on North
Terrace the guardians stood, and still
stand.
On one side the South Australian
Hotel, with its graceful two-storey
veranda; on the other, the grubby but
beautiful little Legislative Council
building, and Parliament House, built
of marble from my hometown,
Kapunda, with great steps and columns
fit for the murder of Julius Caesar.
(The life cycle of South Australian dic-
tators has, however, more resembled


that of Cincinnatus.) Then, just off the
centre of the North Terrace-King Wil-
liam Street intersection, the blatantly
heroic South African war memorial,
symbolic of all the wars into which
Australia has blundered without any
clear idea of the causes or consequences.
Away toward the hills stretches the
tree-lined street which Sir Thomas
Beecham once said was one of the most
beautiful in the world, to the disbelief
of the local populace.
On the left, occupying the finest site
in Adelaide, which surely ought to be
used now for Adelaide’s missing Festi-
val Hall, is Government House in its
gardens; there has never been an Aus-
tralian Governor of South Australia,
and nine out of the last ten have been
sailors, soldiers, or airmen. Opposite is
the Adelaide Club, like a little stone
grave between the concrete mausoleums
of Shell House and the Bank of New
South Wales. Under the trees (of
course, all foreigners) of North Terrace
there are no open-air cafes, despite the
Mediterranean climate, but at different
times of the year art exhibitions, brass
bands, religious, spruikers, and the com-
plex carpets and pictures of Flower
Day assault or delight the people. There
are only dying flowers on the bare
stone of the 1914-18 (doing double duty
for 1939-45) war memorial, one of the
ugliest of those white elephants. Little
Kintore Avenue alongside used to hide
one of the loveliest old buildings in
Adelaide, originally the Police Barracks,
built of brick and stone in a sort of
Dutch style, with curved gables. Under
the public philistinism of Adelaide to-
ward old buildings, which at last is
beginning to be routed, a parking
station existed all around this building,
and bumper bars scrunched against its
stones.
It could have been saved when the
plans for the new State Library were
mooted and turned into an Arts and
Crafts Museum. (There is no such
thing in Adelaide.) But the Government
decreed that the stodgy and impractic-
able Institute Building on the corner
of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue
should remain, and the Police Barracks
be demolished, so now the magnificent
new State Library takes a dogleg round
the comer when it could have come
right on to North Terrace. Sometimes
(as also with the still non-existent
Festival Hall) it seems as if the most
recent planner of • imagination and
authority in Adelaide was Colonel
Light.
Between the Library and the im-
poverished Museum is a lawn where
surprising crowds pack to poetry read-
ings during the Festivals. There, when
I was in the middle of reciting a poem
during the last Festival, a colossal
downpour of rain forced poets and
audience, with makeshift permission, to
dash for shelter into the Museum, and
continue reading among the skeletons
of prehistoric monsters, maybe a sym-
bolic comment on the status of poetry
in Australia.
The rest of the north side of North
Terrace keeps up the standards of dig-
nity and learning. The Art Gallery has
a small but good collection, in a decent,
modest building. Next, the University
crams Gothic, Olde English, and
Twentieth-Century Plate Glass together,
and then comes the Royal Adelaide
Hospital, across Frome Road, which
with its plane trees looks like the en-
trance of a Route Nationale into a
French town. The hospital and the
Children’s Hospital across the park
have the only two huge chimneys
belching black smoke across the clean
stone of central Adelaide; it is ironic,
to say the least, that from these homes
of white sheets, white gowns and caps,
black soot should fall down on the
washing-lines of the ladies of North
Adelaide.
The end of North Terrace is the
Botanic Gardens, where old ladies of
exemplary character dig up specimens
and boast about it to their friends, and
where in term time the ducks scud
across the pools for bread, but in
school holidays are too fat to stir. There
the great Moreton Bay figs have caves
and houses for children between the
toes of their elephant feet, and in the
spring the wisteria walk nearby makes
the air so heavy it seems to fall like
dew.
These parks, the wide heritage left
by Light, were, unfortunately, not
emulated in the speculators’ splurge
that followed as Adelaide spread north
and south between the hills and the
sea. They themselves have had great
bites taken out of them by monsters
like a zoo, bowling clubs, a horse-racing
track, and a cemetery, and are con-
stantly under siege from councillors
hungry for parking lots where meters
would be the trees on the asphalt lawns.
Sometimes the efforts of Councils to
“beautify” the parks have been success-
ful; the site by the Weir of Ernest’s
restaurant is one of the finest in Aus-
tralia. The shallow pool in the eastern
parklands has given pleasure to all ages.
Recently a friend of mine walking past
it saw two old British gentlemen come
down and launch an enormous and
meticulous model of the Queen Mary.
A few minutes later a scarred German
veteran, permitting himself only a scowl
toward the liner, launched a perfect
model of the Bismarck.
“Beautification” is all very well, but
the pale, dry summer look, the gum
trees and galahs of the “unimproved”
parklands are a little bit of real Aus-
tralia in the heart of the city, and
could be let go wilder; would that
Adelaide had something like King’s
Park in Perth.
As it is, the unkempt riverbank,
discreet with leaves and boughs, where
students in my day could kiss their
girls between lectures, has all been tidied
up into terraced stone, rose gardens,
and gravel paths, and even those last
refuges beyond the Zoo are being bull-
dozed to suburban tidiness.
Adelaide has not gone as far as
Denmark, where householders have to
sweep the footpath outside their houses,
but the tyranny of tidiness is exemplified
for me by the neighbor of a friend
of mine, who rakes his gravel path every
evening after he has put his spotless
car away in the garage, and on rainy
days, lest spots appear on the duco, he
takes a taxi to work. A similarly implac-
able tidiness of mind, allied to dark
suspicions of unbridled nature, has until
very recently put the North Adelaide
children’s playground, with its fine
resident steamroller, out of bounds to
men. “But, Daddy, why can’t you take
us to the playground?” Well, you try
explaining that to your six-year-old
daughter.
Though much of Adelaide’s domestic
architecture is as nondescript as any-
thing else built in the last 50-60 years,
Adelaide, typically behind the times,
was very fortunate in keeping a
Colonial tradition well into the period
where ornate ugliness took over else-
where. The good local bluestone made
houses that survived, from early master-
pieces like Ayers House, opposite the
Adelaide Hospital, down to the little
single-storey semi-detached houses of the
central city of North Adelaide, while
from Walkerville across to the foothills
and down to Brighton there are hun-
dreds of dignified stone houses, cool
under their verandas inside their moats
of lawns and flowers, which put to
shame the dull, impractical efforts of
later builders.
One of these days the central square
mile of Adelaide will become fashion-
able, as Paddington has in Sydney, and
then the sensible Italians and Greeks
who inhabit them now will make a for-
tune and retire to stucco splendors on
the Anzac Highway. Percipient people

schoolgirls have an insouciant
smartness which, unfortunately,
is not often a quality of
Adelaide’s young adults
and firms are already reclaiming some
of the neglected two-storey houses for
offices. There is a beautiful example in
Carrington Street, which once saw ser-
vice (if that is the term) as a brothel,
and has been tactfully converted to legal
chambers by two enterprising lawyers,
Chris Legoe and Howard Zelling.
Alas, in many other places those
plundering sons, worse than any bush-
rangers, the petrol stations and used-
car lots, have demolished areas that
would have been cherished in a city
where there was any tradition of living
in a city. For instance, there was a
charming two - storey (rare for
Adelaide) terrace of brick and stone
houses in Grenfell Street, opposite the
Eastern Market, where, at the entrance,
above burgeoning cornucopias, is the
legend “The Earth Is the Lord’s And
the Fullness Thereof.” They have been
demolished to make a used-car lot, and
a legend on that side of the street might
now read, “The Asphalt Is the Car’s
and the Bareness Thereof.” Fortunately,
the gorgeous Victorian extravagance of
the Adelaide Arcade, westward down
the same street, seems safe; the kanga-
roo and emu riding the whirlwind of
decoration have just had a coat of
paint.
Poor Colonel Light designed Adelaide
with a handsome central square, named
after Queen Victoria, and wide shop-
ping streets, and it was not his fault
that the major shopping centre de-
veloped in one of the narrowest streets.
But the council has at last succeeded in
its plans for building a fountain in
Victoria Square, and sculptor John
Dowie has been commissioned for the
job. But I still regret the old Moreton
Bay figs, unfashionable now, under
which the old men sat in peace in the
shade of the shiny, leathery leaves.
Dowie’s fountain should be handsome,
but fountains in Adelaide have been a
mixed blessing; the dreadful new one
on North Terrace by the Aluseum looks
like a pissoir from Brobdingnag.
Adelaide in my boyhood in the 1930 s
was a coun try town, even though its
population, over half a million now,
was t h e 300,0005. On fierce north-
wind days the dust was so thick that
one could hardly see across North
Terrace, and the land dominated South
Australia’s economy and society. There
were no restaurants at all, though for
a b o y die Covent Garden Cafe had
beaut snags and mash, and the pie-stall
by the G.P.O. sold floaters, as it does
now; a floater is a South Australian
specialty, a pie floating in a bowl of
thick green pea soup.
South Australian Hotel was the
tne aoutn Australian notei was ine
absolute arbiter of taste. The head-
waiter > Lew y> ordere r d a distinguished
overseas guest out of the dining-room
for wearing a silk scarf and an open-
neck s m rt instead of a collar and tie.
Next day a group of Univeristy students,
carrying a placard “Fooey to Lewy,”
entered the dining-room immaculately
clad in stiff shirts, black bow-ties
and n 0 trousers.
Mothers warned their daughters never
to be seen like Miss X, “wearing a
cotton dress and sandals to lunch at the
South.” I can remember mouse hunts
across the green lino and under the
black chairs in the lounge, with stags’
heads looking down. A little before my
time the young gentry used occasionally
to drive down North Terrace potting
street lamps with a gun, and one famous
Adelaide character drove his Riley
Nine up the steps of the South and
into the dining-room. It was he, some
years later, who put a frog into Lewy’s
hand instead of a tip.
The small-town attitudes of Adelaide
people still survive in many ways. One
of the more amusing is their reluctance
to shop almost anywhere else except in
Rundle Street between King William
and Pulteney Streets. A few days ago
I was going up the escalator in John
Martin’s and heard one girl say to her
companions, “I heard there are some
fabulous shoes at Millers, but you
couldn’t possibly walk that far.” Miller
Anderson’s is all of a hundred yards
across King William Street; however,
it does good business as its directors
have sensibly built a car park right
alongside it. Alas, the parking station is
on the site of the old Theatre Royal;
Laurence Olivier and Sybil Thorndike
and others used to say it was one of the
most pleasing theatres they had ever
played in.
Hindley Street has always been
Adelaide’s Latin Quarter, and still is.
But as well as Italians and Greeks,.
South Australia has had “New Aus-
tralians” for more than 120 years.
Governor Grey, for example, in 1845,
was writing home to his father: “Ther
European population are collected from
almost all parts of the world,” and he
also mentions Chinese and Indians. He
particularly dwells on “Germans in
their national costumes, and very pic-
turesque they are. We have about a
thousand Germans here who have
abandoned their country upon account
of religious persecution.” The Germans
in return have given South Australia
many of its best wines, and long before
the rest of Australia went all Contin-
ental we South Australians were eating

leberwurst and pumpernickel and mett-
wurst and a delicious dry cake always
known simply as German cake. (I once
saw leberwurst offered on the menu of
the South Australian Hotel as “liebe-
wurst,” which unfortunately means
“love-sausage.”)
It is strange that Adelaide and South
Australia, with their radical and cosmo-
politan beginnings, should have become
more British than the British, and so
conservative as to keep (with the help
of the gerrymander) Sir Thomas Play-
ford in office for 27 years. Not that
Playford was conservative either in
many of his policies or in the sense that
it is understood in Establishment
quarters in Adelaide. He was never a
member of the Adelaide Club, and
indeed several old members there
regarded him as a bit of a Red, in the
same way that at the time of the Stuart
case, Playford’s opponent, Rohan Rivett,
and “The News,” which he edited for
Rupert Murdoch, were regarded as
akin to Molotov and “Pravda.” Until
recently the Adelaide Establishment
was extraordinarily cohesive in its dom-
ination of Adelaide social and political
life, and much of the character, good
as well as bad, of Adelaide life came
from that domination.
A lot of nonsense has been talked
about the Adelaide Establishment. As
with most institutions with which one
has grown up, I have a love-hate
relationship with it. I cherish the
memory of an old gentleman, at mid-
day with the temperature over 105
degrees, wearing as ever an impeccable
grey suit of good, heavy English tweed,
with waistcoat, navigating with consider-
able disdain of traffic across North
Terrace from the Government House
side to the Adelaide Club, there to sip
a pink gin and read the progress
reports on the Oxford and Cambridge
crews in the London “Times.”
The Establishment in Adelaide has
never been in a hurry. Managing direc-
tors and judges could be seen any day
between 2.30 and 3 p.m., heading seri-
ously southwards along King William
Street, in the tradition of a 17th-century
English writer, who might have been
approving of them and deprecating the
speedy young modern executive when
he wrote: “A constant smirk upon the
face, and a whiffling activity of the
body, are strong indications of futility.
Whoever is in a hurry, shows that the
thing he is about is too big for him.”
The same easy-going attitude is true
of all non-rat-race types in Adelaide.
The other day I was walking past a hole
in the ground in King William Street
and I heard one man on top call out
to another below: “Here, mate, gimme
the spade. Yer can’t smoke and dig at
the same time. Climb out and enjoy
yer smoke.”
Of course, although the Adelaide
Establishment has always taken its
standards and its British ideals very
seriously indeed, Australian democracy
keeps on breaking in, even in Adelaide.
I remember one night at the old Theatre
Royal, several years ago, when the
Governor was coming, sitting in the
stalls just below the ledge of the dress
circle where the Governor’s party sits
in the centre of the front row. There
were four men in the seats behind us,
and one said, “Hey, they reckon the
Governor’s coming. We’ll be sitting
right underneath him.” “Jeez-eh,” said
another, “I hope he doesn’t drop his
peanut shells on us.”
In the same vein, on the occasion of
the Queen Mother’s visit to the Festival
of Arts in 1958, the crowds were drawn
up on either side of King William Street
to watch her arrive at the Town Hall,
when at the last moment a City Council
garbage truck drove between the massed
ranks, manned by three hairy-legged
blokes in shorts, one of them giving
the best regal wave of the inclined
hand to the crowds.
The Adelaide Establishment is at its
most ambivalent in relation to the Fes-
tival. Business and professional men
who would never dream of asking an
artist or a writer to dinner, nor of hang-
ing anything more modern than a Hans
Heysen on their walls (Bill Hayward
and Bob Wreford are obvious and shin-
ing exceptions), got together and
financially guaranteed a Festival of Arts.
Held every two years, it is now firmly
established as the most important Arts
Festival in Australia. A great deal of the
credit for the success of the Adelaide
Festival was due to Professor John
Bishop, whose secret of putting a spark
into Adelaide was that he was always
unorthodox but never bohemian. His
sudden death in England in 1965 was
a tragedy for the Festival and for the
Conservatorium, of which he was a
director. Now, at long last, the Festival
Governors have appointed an artistic
director, Robert Helpmann, who is un-
fortunately not taking up his post until
after the 1968 Festival; he is likely to
be both unorthodox and bohemian,
which will be good for Adelaide.
The Festival has been heavily sup-
ported (too heavily, some would say)
by the paternalism of the Adelaide
“Advertiser.” Until recently under the
direction of Sir Lloyd Dumas, this
paternalism extends also to an open-
air art show, a literary competition,
and many other activities, a record not
equalled by any other Australian news-
paper.
The most successful of all paternal-
istic ventures in Adelaide is Bill Hay-
ward’s Christmas Pageant, entirely
mounted and paid for by John Martin’s
(one of the big Rundle Street stores,
with branches elsewhere). There is no
advertising and no charge for anything,
and the police estimate well over
400,000 people turned up for the last
Pageant, some of them coming from
hundreds of miles away. There is the
essence of Adelaide in the patience and
order exemplified by the trucks parked
along the streets late at night, so chil-
dren and grown-ups will be able to
watch from them in the morning, and
the blue “honor line” drawn along the
street over which the massed thousands
will not set a foot.
Together with its paternal elders,
Adelaide also has its eccentrics, prob-
ably a richer collection than any other
Australian city; it never seemed sur-
prising to meet Daisy Bates, in full Vic-
torian rigout, tapping along the foot-
path of North Terrace. There have also
been some notable non-conformist sons,
such as Kym Bonython and Max Harris,
who both continue to live in Adelaide
although their interests and reputations
are national, not merely local. Oddly
enough, in their different ways they lead
a balanced life that is essentially the
best achievement of Adelaide. They
both went to St. Peter’s, the most
Establishment school (though Scotch
College can boast Charles Fisher as
headmaster, son of a recent Archbishop-
of Canterbury), but neither particu-
larly love or are loved by the Estab-
lishment. Bonython drives his own
speedcar at his own Rowley Park Speed-
way; Harris, an excellent footballer at
school, is an ardent Australian Rules
follower. Bonython runs an ABC jazz
session, while Harris is well known on
TV. Harris drinks with an assortment
of mates including the Chief Justice
at a pub in Grenfell Street; Bonython
never drinks, but takes to the liquid
element in a midget submarine.
Adelaide is changing. A Chief Justice,
John Bray, who is not a member of the
Adelaide Club and enjoys a drink at
a pub and writes poetry and verse
plays. A Labor Premier, Don Dunstan,
who is only 40, went to St. Peter’s and
sends his sons there, plays Mozart on
the piano, and reads Sartre and is
married to a university economist. The
radical origins of the city are putting
out new leaves.
Adelaide is still the city on the
edge of the something that could be
anything. To the south, Russian and
Japanese trawlers took ten times as
much tuna as the Australian fishing
boats last season. To the north, French
teams are drilling for oil in the Simpson
Desert, and to the north-west is Ayers
Rock and the Western Australian
deserts and the remnants of that Abor-
iginal life so wonderfully described and
photographed by Charles Mountford.
On the southern edge of Adelaide itself
is the enormous Chrysler works (surely
the cleanest and best looking car fac-
tory in the world) with the rapidly
sprouting Flinders University across the
road. To the east the suburbs are
steadily climbing the hills, stopped to
the west by the ,sea. People regularly
complain about the gaunt face of the
great quarry in the dark-treed hills,
but in certain lights it is extremely
beautiful. Adelaide is growing to be a
long, narrow city which before long
will stretch 60 miles from Willunga to
Gawler. There are hopeful signs that it
may not also have only long, narrow
views.

The Medium is McLuhan
IN THE MYSTERIOUS WAY such
things happen nowadays, the name
Marshall McLuhan suddenly begins to
be on every lip. His famous dictum,
“the Medium is the Message” (modi-
fied in the title of his latest published
work to “the Medium is the Massage”),
has, of course, been familiar for some
time past. But it is only in the last year
or so that the man himself has come to
take his place in contemporary folk-
lore, along with Sartre, Picasso, Bert-
rand Russell, Ginsburg, and other in-
tellectual trend-setters.
The glossy magazines, ultimate pan-
theon of our time, have claimed him
for their own; students crowd his lec-
tures, the big-business elite, like IBM
and “Fortune” magazine, vie with one
another for his services, and most
significant of all the Fordham Jesuits
have hired him for an Albert Schweit-
zer professorship, which he is taking up
after 14 years at Toronto as head of the
English department.
I was thus the more interested to
make his acquaintance at a telly-session
in Montreal; actually in the precincts
of the Expo, with the pavilions looming
up around us, the little blue monorail
train flitting to and fro, and the crowds
of spectators ambling past in that lost
way which belongs to such occasions,
and always, for some reason, makes me
think of the Judgment Day.
Inevitably, McLuhan turned out to
be quite different from his public image
as it had been impressed on me. I ex-
pected to find an explosively energetic
man puffing out “ideas,” as some North
American academics do, breathlessly,
like a car going down a steep hill in
low gear. A sort of postgraduate H. G.
Wells. Instead, he turned out to be an
austere, rather exceptionally restrained
man; more, I decided, like a Jesuit him-
self than a campus hero, with one of
those concentrated, compressed coun-
tenances which suggest inward travail,
not outward exuberance.
I thought at once of Teilhard de
Chardin the Mass of the Media in-
stead of the Mass of the World. Perhaps
trying to make sense of the 20th century
just has that effect on people. Suppose
after all they must say to themselves
from time to time, there is no message.
With us on the set was Norman
Mailer, a very different sort of person.
In a way I love him; there’s a warmth
and even simplicity about him which
I find very appealing. If McLuhan is
a Jesuit, he’s a rabbi, and kept trying,
rabbi-wise, to get McLuhan to say
whether all these changes he so con-
fidently predicts are to be regarded as
good or bad.
Nothing doing. McLuhan just sat
tight-lipped and refused to say; with
a wave of his hand, abolishing every-
thing money’s over, sex is over,
childhood’s over, print’s over, words
are over, classrooms are over, educa-
tion’s over, and so moral judgments
must be over, too. Just about every-
thing seemed to be over, except, may-
be, McLuhan and television and the
telephone and IBM, but whether this
was desirable or undesirable he reso-
lutely refused to say. Render unto the
audio-tactile the things that are audio-
tactile. He, McLuhan, was visual; so
was Mailer, so was I.
As far as he personally was con-
cerned, McLuhan would much rather
have lived in the 18th century, say,
than now. But he didn’t. He was living
now a visual man in an audio-tactile
world who just contented himself with
pointing out what was happening. The
Marshall McLuhan ... abolishing
everything
Medium is the Message. Or Massage.
Right?
I made a few feeble attempts to get
my oar in. Printing, which, according
to McLuhan, had made such a differ-
ence, was, after all, only invented a
few centuries ago. What,about all the
pre-print men like Socrates and Homer
and Confucius and Asoka and Akhna-
ton? They were tribal, it seemed, as
we’re visual and the kids audio-tactile.
(It’s because the kids are audio-tactile
and we’re visual that there’s such an
abyss between us and them; also why
so many are drop-outs an attractive
notion on the campus. How can audio-
tactile kids be expected to pass visual
exams?)
According to McLuhan, “Printing
created the portable book which men
could read in privacy and in isolation
from others.” Didn’t Ovid have a port-
able book or two? And St. Augustine?
Did they do all their reading in pub-
lic? I hadn’t thought so. Useless,
actually, to raise such points. McLuhan
just listens with a kind of half-smile.
Visual vaporings, he seems to be say-
ing.
My head was full of queries. “The
child was an invention of the 17th cen-
tury; he did not exist in, say, Shake-
speare’s day.” Really? “And He took a
child and set him in the midst of
them.” That was well before Shake-
speare, wasn’t it? And who followed
the Pied Piper gnomes or what?
“Authorship in the sense we know
it today was practically unknown
before the advent of print technology.”
Boccaccio, Chaucer, Horace, Sophocles,
not to mention Omar Khayyam, Lao
Tzu, and Thomas A’Kempis weren’t
they authors? “The idea of detention
in a closed space as a form of human
punitive corrective action seems to have
come in very much in the 13th and
14th centuries.” I alwavs thought St.
Paul did a stretch in the cells. And
wasn’t I shown in Peking some dun-
geons going back much further even
than that? “There were no bedrooms up
to the 17th century . . . Shakespeare
never knew such a place as a private
bedroom.” He put Desdemona in one,
though, and say! that reminds me I
live in an Elizabethan house and it has
always had bedrooms. “When a new
medium goes around an old medium
the old medium becomes an art form
. . . When the novel gave way to the
movies the novel became an art form.”
Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, for that
matter Cervantes, not considered art
forms in their day? Phew!
Examples chosen at random; there’s
one or more on pretty well every page
of McLuhan’s that I’ve read. Similarly
with Toynbee, as more learned pens
than mine have indicated Trevor-
Roper’s, for instance. Trevor-Roper
simply skinned Toynbee alive, but it
didn’t make the slightest difference; he
continued to pontificate, and his “Study
of History” went on being taken seri-
ously wherever two or more Ph.D.
aspirants were gathered together. Now
Toynbee’s out of fashion and Mc-
Luhan’s coming up.
The two have a lot in common; their
appeal is that they propound a general
theory into which everything can be
fitted. McLuhan even brings in Twiggy;
she’s lineal, he says. And color tele-
vision is “hot,” in contradistinction to
black-and-white, which is “cool.” Or
maybe it’s the other way round. No
matter. There’s a passage in Taine
I copied out once which seems particu-
larly applicable here:
Rien de plus dangereux qu’une idee
generale dans des cerveaux etroits et
vides; comme ils sont vides, elle n’y
rencontre aucun savoir qui lui fasse
obstacle; comme ils sont etroits, elle ne
tarde pas a les occuper tout entiers.
Des lors ils ne s’appartiennent plus, ils


You could buy two

So if you find that something ‘reasonably good’ satisfies
your needs, forget Parini. The hundred dollars or so
you pay for a Parini makes sense only to the man who
finds pleasure and stimulus in a degree of tailoring
craftsmanship that amounts to art.
The Parini wearer is usually of top-level executive
status. This is partly because such a man can afford
Parini. Partly because such a man usually got to where
he is through a habit of never settling for anything but
the very best.

This fits McLuhan like a glove. It’s
not difficult to see why his propositions
appeal, especially to the young. In the
first place, they imply that we are
living in uniquely extraordinary times,
and therefore must be uniquely ex-
traordinary human beings. History went
maundering along for centuries and
centuries, barely registering any change;
but now, man! it’s swinging. Yesterday
visual, today audio-tactile; who knows
what it’ll be tomorrow?
Then McLuhanism relieves us of
moral responsibility -- the burden we
most want to shed. We didn’t make the
telephone, and if it’s the message there’s
nothing we can do about it. If print’s
on the way out, why bother to read?
If thought’s better done in a com-
puter than in a brain-box, why bother
to think at all?
For LSD, my dear,
For LSD,
We’ll tak a puff of kindness yet,
For LSD.
Is it all, then, a load of rubbish?
Not quite. McLuhan is making a valid
point that mass-communication
media, especially television, are having
the effect of retribalising and deliterat-
ising their addicts. His notion of man-
kind as a global village gathered round
a television set and looking at the same
programs (“Peyton Place,” “The
Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” etc.) is not so
way-out as it sounds. Everyone who
appears on television knows that very
few viewers listen at all; they just look
and imbibe whatever they do imbibe
without involvement in any thought
process. Their impressions are taken in
off the screen as leaves take in sun-
light. It’s quite different from reading
or thinking; the interpolation of words
is out of place, and may well in time,
as McLuhan suggests, be dispensed with
altogether.
But how, maestro, if what is really
signified is just decadence, just Gad-
arene swine disappearing over the cliff,
rather than a route march from callig-
raphy to print to the telly and a brave
new audio-tactile world? Just a retreat
from reason, and finally from meaning
itself Operation Fiat Nox! One
imagines some Roman McLuhan casting
a knowing look at the games—audio-
tactile boys will be boys; making all
sorts of deductions from Nero’s per-
missive morality and the infiltration of
curious practices from the East.
All beside the point as things turned
out. The decisive factor in the next
2000 years of history was to be a man
no one had heard of, put to death in
a remote province of the empire, and
his little band of obscure and mostly
illiterate followers.


The Protest
FROM BOOTS TO Beatle-cut it was
clear that he was one of the small but
blossoming bunch of Melbourne flower
people. He spends a lot of time in a
new Carlton cafe which hopes to culti-
vate the Hippie cult, and quite possibly
he worked for Collingwood City Coun-
cil—he wouldn’t say. What led him to
sip the sweet nectars of flower power?
Why did he become a Hippie? I thought
he would probably answer “love,” or
“loving-in,” or even something more in-
tellectual like “Gandhi” or “The
Buddha.” But his forthright reply was
“Protest, man . . . Protest.”
So I asked him what he was protest-
ing against. “Against all the things folk
like you stand for, man, like motor-
cars, and business suits, and plain neck-
ties, and start-work whistles, and cream-
brick housing estates, and automation.”
I thought this was a bit rough, because
the only way all of it affects me is
that I do have a couple of plain ties,
and it also struck me that he was
rather fluent for a Hippie. Collingwood
City Council, no. He was probably a
failed university student protesting
against the exam system.
What about war and Vietnam? Was
he protesting against them, too? “Not
like the others, man, who protest out
of hate. I protest for love and against
hate and against society.” Which
society? “Any society. This society. The
rat-race. Rum and coke. Or whisky
and soda. Any way you like to call
it.” I made my own silent protest and
called it off after peering closer at the
button pinned to his coat. It read:
“Amor vincit omnia.” A loving and
literate protester, indeed.
Way-out folk have a mysterious dia-
lectical manner of also being way-in.
Protesting, by all accounts, has become
a popular pastime. For some it is a
serious professional business. In fact
protesting has almost become part of
the rat-race, which is very hard on the
promoters of flower power. From “Ban
the Bomb” demonstrations, which were
tame enough in Australia for lack of
a Lord Russell, through those associ-
ated with various “Peace” rallies (which
often had eddies of violence) to the
Conscription and Vietnam issues, with
their brawls and clashes Wlth P ollce >

professionalism in protests and demon-
strations. The same faces keep turning

some are simple enthusiasts, and many
are on the fringe either exhibition-
ists or people who will march anywhere

longing f° r a f ew moments to a group.

But these are all protesters who join

at tbe pf t i n g Q f a p l acard and the
utterance of a phrase “the right to

words of the song, teachers and trainee
teachers do it, journalists do it, nurses,
too. Students, of course, almost every
week. Once concerned only with Com-
mem Day pranks, today’s serious Aus-
tralian student lends his or her frail
body and piping voice to rallies behind
placards calling for Utzon in Charge
(°f the Sydney Opera House), “Free-
dom for the City Art Gallery” (in Bris-
bane), “Give Power to the Public”
(referring to Sydney University’s Power
Bequest for Art), and any other subject
which exercises the student protest
nerve.
Australia’s migrants are also as
quick to react as anyone, but their pro-
tests are usually directed toward targets
well over the horizon, following events
which have meant homeland upheavals.
Locals who would only get that angry

their heads and wonder as small hordes

consulate or High Commission,
By some process of osmosis the
strings of protest have deeplv
permeated the tissue of modern society,
On a recent Thursday in Canberra
(becoming a favorite centre for dem-
onstrations) no less than five inde-
pendent bands of protesters marched
on Parliament. One protested against
the treatment of Aborigines, another
against the Vietnam war, another
against the plight of pensioners, v a
fourth against the meanness of the
Government’s foreign economic aid
program, and the last against conscrip-
tion of National Servicemen for over-
seas service.

names to Victorian Liberal Member Mr.
Phillip Lynch, who later tabled the
petition in the Lower House. Next up
was a group of 30 Aborigines carrying
well-printed banners protesting against
housing conditions, educational oppor-
tunities, medical and dental services,
and demanding “land rights for
Aborigines.” The secretary of the Fed-
eral Council of Aborigines and Torres
Strait Islanders, Mrs. Faith Bandler,
hoped to bring her protest to the atten-
tion of senior Ministers, but had to be
content with talking to Mr. Wentworth
and Mr. Bryant. Mr. Wentworth later
protested in the House that it was
about time the Federal Government
set up a co-ordinating authority to deal
with the needs of Aborigines.
At 1.30 a vigil of protesting ministers,
priests, and laity gathered on the lawn
outside Parliament House. They medi-
tated, prayed, and protested against
“the continuing suffering and deva'sta-
tion of Vietnam, and to plead with the
Australian Government to take immedi-
ate initiative to bring the war to an
end.” The words are taken from the
book of the Rev. Alan Walker. The
Prime Minister refused to receive them.
More successful was the Save Our Sons
Movement, which won an interview
with the Minister for the Army, and
although admitting afterwards that “we
failed to convince him,” had the con-
solution of being able to claim, no
doubt with full sincerity, “and he failed
to convince us.”
.
The most consistent protesters have
been the pensioners, who have staged a
silent protest since the announcement
of the Budget. They have adopted black
armbands as a sign of mourning, at the
Government’s refusal to grant pension
increases. On the armbands are written
the words “Give us this day our daily
bread.” The Australian Pensioners’
Federation is asking its 85,000 mem-
bers to wear the black armbands for 12
months in protest against “the malnu-
trition Budget.” In addition to the arm-
bands, some of the pensioners outside
Parliament were draped in “mourning
sashes” of black paper crepe,
From the flower power of the Hippies
to the moral power of the pensioners,
the spectrum of protesters may seem
as broad as the society against which
they are directed. But Queensland Uni-
versity offers a protest with a qualita-
tive difference: a protest movement for

Ine market, it seems, is wide open
for some enterprising social observer
(o introduce a local version of the
American protest kit. In New York the
basic equipment, such as banners, plac-
ards, streamers, buttons, whistles, and
sandwich-boards, can be bought over the
counter just like other consumer dur-
ables. At least one firm makes a good
thing of hiring out its protest kits.
More, recently, the market has been
undercut by professional protesters who
hire themselves out to picketing and
protesting organisations on a sort of
have-banner-will-travel arrangement.
This professional touch has attendant
disadvantages. The news pictures of
Catholic priests with their banners
proclaiming “We want wives” could not
be replaced by those of hard-faced pro-
fessionals demanding “Give the priests
wives” and retain the same authority.
The best protests are the manifest
cries from the heart. For example, the
recent newspaper report of a young-
couple driving down Sydney Road,
Melbourne, in a van with Queensland
number plates. In the back window was
the sign: “Teach in Queensland . . .
and despair.” Education, of course, has
become one of the great protest issues,
along with Vietnam, conscription,
Aborigines, and pensions. In Victoria,
teachers have staged some fine protests
and their banners have shown edifying
concern for straight margins and better
conditions of service. The students have
followed the lead of their masters with
some relish. During a teachers’ stop-
work meeting in Melbourne last year,
one high-school girl, who turned up
with some friends to supply moral sup-
port, paraded down the aisle with the
placard proclaiming: “Nuts to Bolte.”
The flower people would protest at
such a declaration of militancy.

OVERSEAS
Is the U.S. going to
clip its wings?
THE SECRET, the Secretary of De-
fence said last week, could be kept no
longer. The long-discussed electronic
barrier is to be built south of the so-
called demilitarised zone between North
and South Vietnam. Mr. McNamara
was chary of information at his Press
conference, but the Press is full of
stories of elaborate electronic equip-
ment (as well as of plain barbed wire)
including minute sensors which would
give warning of the advance of enemy
troops, ground-surveillance radar and
mines dropped by air. This is to be no
Maginot Line but more of a trip-wire
system, a sort of military burglar alarm.
It is not just a little local victory
that Mr. McNamara has won over the
air-power lobby in Washington. The
decision to build a barrier across the
neck of South Vietnam means that the
attempt to stop the North Vietnamese
sending arms and men into the south
has taken a new turn: the emphasis of
the interdiction campaign has shifted
from the air to the ground. This
does not mean that the bombing of
specific targets in the north will or
should stop. As Mr. McGeorge Bundy
said in a letter to the Washington
“Post” on September 11, the case for
stopping the bombing altogether is no
stronger than the case for believing
that bombing alone will decide the issue.
The air campaign exacts a toll of the
military traffic passing from north to
south; it involves in repair work a large
number of men who might otherwise
be sent to fight in the south; it makes
North Vietnam more dependent on the
Russians for supplies, and therefore
possibly more open to Russian advice.
Its advantages are limited, but they
exist.
This is why two bridges near the
centre of Haiphong were hit on Sep-
tember 12. But it would be foolish not
to admit that President Johnson’s de-
cision to let these bridges be attacked
was also a consolation prize for the air-
power enthusiasts in Washington. They
need a consolation prize because they
have been denied the massive expansion
of bombing that they want: they have
been told that this war is going to be
decided on the ground in the south,
not in the air over the north.
So Mr. McNamara has made his
point, for the moment at any rate. But
in the process he has done something,.
else, of an importance that extends
far beyond Vietnam itself. For half a
century a large number of people have
tried to persuade themselves that the
invention of flying machines has
changed the whole nature of war. In
some fields they are right. Air power
has nullified sea power: seaborne
weapons are now obliged to go under-
water unless they Rave cast-iron protec-
tion from their own Air Force. But what
has happened in Vietnam in the past
two years has made it clear that, in
other fields, the aircraft enthusiasts
have got to modify their ideas very
considerably indeed. Mr. McNamara
has had the honesty to recognise the
limitations of air power, and to make
other people recognise them, too.
It is not really odd that this should
have happened in the summer when
tactical air power has actually achieved
its most spectacular success yet: the
Israelis’ victory in Sinai. The Sinai
battle was a stunning example of what
air power can do when, but only when,
the conditions are right. The Sinai
campaign was a perfect illustration of
the conditions that allow air power to
come into its own. If the bombers can
see what is happening below, and if
their targets are drawn up in the serried
array of an organised army, command
of the air can be decisive.
It is when neither of these condi-
tions applies that things go wrong. If
the enemy below refuses to draw himself
up into tightly packed targets waiting
for the thunderbolt to descend, and if
he is operating in country that conceals
him from the hunter overhead, the
bomber ceases to be effective. This is
what has happened in Vietnam. It is
the combination of these two factors—
the terrain and the guerilla style of
warfare that clip the bomber’s wings.
The bomber is essentially a long-range
piece of artillery. It can reach farther
than a gun, and it can be switched
more easily between widely separated
targets. But in other ways it is less
efficient than a gun. It is less accurate.
Because it is more expensive to make
and to use, it costs a lot more per ton
of explosive delivered on target. A
guerilla enemy operating in jungle or
in thick bush immediately exposes these
limitations.
The lesson is plain. In Vietnam two
choices now present themselves. First,
the bombing of North Vietnam can be
stepped up. But there can be no cer-
tainty that this will bring quick vic-
tory unless it is carried beyond the
point where the political risks involved,
in relation to the military damage
caused, become very large indeed. The
second is to pay back the guerillas in
their own coin of attrition, seeking
to destroy their bands of troops and
to deny them their local sources of
supplies. Both are tasks for the ground
forces, supported but not superseded by
air power. That conclusion is a bitter
one, particularly to those who think
there is one talisman, the bomber, that
can bring the frustrations, anxieties, and
miseries of a long war to a speedy
end. But it is a policy which many
people, from the British with their
experience in Malaya to the Australians
already in South Vietnam, have rightly
been urging on the Americans.

Why the shooting?
WHAT ARE THE CHINESE up to?
Was the artillery duel that started last
week on the Sikkim - Tibet border
an isolated display of bad temper or
did it presage a bigger conflict? The
guess in New Delhi is that this was a
local incident, though the most serious
since the war of 1962. At the bottom
of it is a jockeying for points of
vantage. The Chinese evidently do not
like India’s troops being perched atop
a ridge from which they look down
upon the Chumbi Valley, a triangular
wedge separating Sikkim from Bhutan.
Another possible reason is the Indian
attempt to erect a barbed-wire fence
along the (demarcated and agreed)
border. New Delhi is playing it cool.
On Tuesday Mrs. Gandhi spent a whole
day away from the capital, visiting
neighboring Punjab, and her plans to
go to Ceylon this Monday on a State
Mrs. Gandhi ... playing it cool
visit stand. The Defence Minister was
due to leave for Moscow on Thurs-
day, and the Army’s chief of staff has
just begun an eight-day visit to France.
The new shooting match could not
have been more inopportune. It came
just when India’s foreign-policy makers
were debating among themselves the
pros and cons of a more flexible posture
toward neighboring countries. Just
before he resigned a fortnight ago (on
another issue), the then Foreign Mini-
ster, Mr. Chagla, said publicly that
India was ready for a dialogue with
China “as soon as China shows the
slightest intention for it”—a distinct de-
parture from previous insistence that
China must first accept the “Colombo
proposals” of 1963 and the later de-
mand for the evacuation of Chinese
civilian posts in the demilitarised zone
of Ladakh.
The reaction of the Chinese suggests
that they attach no importance to this
rethinking, reckoning that India is far
too committed to the United States and
Russia to make it worth while to seek
a meeting-ground. Adding to China’s
chagrin is the shift in the Indian
attitude toward Tibet and Formosa. For
many months New Delhi has been
ready to support (though not to
initiate) moves to bring up Tibet at
the United Nations as a question of
human rights. And last week Mr.
Morarji Desai, India’s Deputy Prime
Minister, said unexpectedly in Washing-
ton that there are in fact “two
Chinas” something that India
has never said before.
United States
Foreign aid cut
EACH YEAR the struggle for foreign
aid goes a little worse for the Admini-
stration, though, to be sure, by dogged
persistence and exploitation of any
stroke of luck that comes to hand, a
recognisable foreign-aid policy has in
fact been kept in existence. This year’s
congressional struggle represents the
most severe defeat the program has
suffered during Mr. Johnson’s Presi-
dency. He was putting it mildly when
he admitted, in his Press conference on
September 1, “we were disappointed in
many respects at the action taken.”
The House of Representatives, once
the friend of almost any kind of mili-
tary aid, spent most of one night in
hanging restrictions on to President
Johnson’s discretion to engage in arms
transactions with foreign countries. One
of these new restrictions would prohibit
him from acquiring any defence articles
or defence services from, or providing
them to, any country that sells or car-
ries any goods to North Vietnam, or
allows ships under its registry to do
so, “so long as North Vietnam is gov-
erned by a Communist regime.”
Representative Gross, of lowa, who
proposed this amendment, made no
bones about whom he was getting at
“the perfidious British, for instance,
who have been sending their ships into
North Vietnam with hundreds of tons
of supplies of all kinds” and he
did not care whether a ship was in
British service or British ownership if
it flew the British flag. His amendment
would bar the United States from com-
pleting some $2.5 billion worth of
arms sales already contracted for and,
most notably, from supplying the F-11l
aircraft to Britain. It would also block
the purchases of various defence items
from Britain, which were part of the

same bargain. Naturally, the Admini-
stration will do its best to get this re-
striction removed and, with support
from the Senate, it will very likely
succeed.
When the Senate came to debate
the Foreign Assistance Act the enemies
of arms deals won amendments
which, if they are sustained, will almost
cripple the present military aid policy.
These severely restrict its power to
make sales at all and cut the amount
authorised for plain military assistance
from $6BO million (the Administration’s
request) to $475 million. Both Houses
have taken up a generally hostile
attitude to supplying anything like
modern arms to the under-developed
countries, including the Arab, African,
and Latin-American nations.
The technical assistance program has
got off lightly with a cut from $243
million to $2lO million (both Houses
chose the same figure). More severely,
they agreed to cut the Administration’s
request for the Alliance for Progress
from $750 million to $578 million. The
development loan program, on general
grounds the most useful part of the
whole policy, got the meat-axe; the
Senate reduced the amount from $750
million to $5OO million and the House
to $450 million, so that the final
authorisation will necessarily be be-
tween those two totals. The rate of
interest on these “soft loans” in the
grace period is increased from 1 per-
cent to 2 percent.
To make things harder, the Senate
voted to limit to 15 the number of
countries permitted to receive develop-
ment loans at all. The President dodged
a restriction of this kind last year by
using an escape clause to certify some
14 small countries as special cases, but
he will be fortunate to get such a
clause this year. This restriction hits
Africa - there are 37 African coun-
tries where the United States is invol-
ved in some kind of aid program
and it is, of course, precisely this kind
of universal assistance that Mr. John-
son’s critics in Congress are trying to-
end. In fact, the Administration’s
development loans program allowed
only $9O million for all Africa; even
this amount will be hard to obtain.

New Order paper. The independent
“Berita Indonesia,” close to the
“Murba” party and once an arch-foe of
Subandrio and company, was obliged
to switch from daily to weekly publi-
cation. Many other papers have met
the same fate and others may follow.
Even the brave students’ daily,
“Harian Kami,” and the daring
“Operasi” seem to be in a precarious
position.
In the provinces, the daily paper
situation is not much better. Not a
single daily is still published in Palem-
bang, provincial capital of South Sum-
atra; in Medan, farther north, six
dailies have closed. Two were forced
to liquidate in Jogjakarta.
The Indonesian Newspaper Pub-
lishers’ Association (SPS) has recently
revealed some dramatic figures on the
declining newspaper circulation in a
country of 110 million a 50 percent
decrease was registered during the first
six months of this year. The present
circulation totals only 700,000 copies,
compared with 1.4 million in Decem-
ber, 1966.
Neither direct nor indirect pressure
from the authorities has led to the
death of many papers in Indonesia. The
Indonesian Press has been the victim
of the complicated process of transition
from a subsidised to a market economy.
In the days of Sukarno, the Press was
considered a tool of “nation and char-
acter building.” The newspapers did
not have to be commercially successful
but were supported by the State with
all sorts of facilities and subsidies.
Progress in the field of Press freedom
and the introduction of a Basic Press
Law (though not perfectly implemented
by the planned establishment of a Press
Council) have proved insufficient for
the development of an effective and
self-supporting Press.
To continue State subsidies indefin-
itely is impossible and contrary to the
principle of a free Press. Yet, some
measures must be taken to overcome
the present difficulties and to help the
Indonesian Press stand on its own feet.
The blame for conditions cannot be
simply placed upon the management,
since advertising, which covers most
of newspaper expenses under “normal”
conditions, cannot play a vital role in
Indonesia at present due to the general
weakness of the economy. A certain
amount of consolidation (mergers)
among the Indonesian Press seems to
be indispensable.

Economic Review," Hong Kong)
Malaysia
Threats to security
A REMINDER of the problems that
face Malaysia in trying to reconcile
her belief in freedom and democracy
with the dangers to her security posed
by Communist activists was given by
Tun Razak, the Deputy Prime Min-
ister, when announcing the release of
180 detainees. He spoke of the diffi-
culty of maintaining “a delicate bal-
ance between internal security and civil
liberties” and of the Government’s
desire to create “a liberal and tolerant
society.”
In spite of the Government’s recent
generosity, however, it is still disturb-
ing that so many years after the end-
ing of the Emergency, hundreds of
detainees are still in camps, regula-
tions permit detention without trial for
indefinite periods, and new provisions
allow the Government to take even
sterner measures against “unlawful
demonstrators.” In connection with the
recent sporadic, hit-and-run demonstra-
tions by Left-wing extremists, the police
have warned that they will open fire
without hesitation. The Opposition, of
course, makes capital from any strong
measures that the Government takes
and mutters darkly about a muzzled
Press, improper methods of interroga-
tion by the police, and people being
held in solitary cells that “are totally
unsuitable for human habitation.” But
it is to Malaysia’s credit that such
criticism cap be raised openly in
Parliament by Opposition leaders.
The very real danger that Malaysia
still faces from armed Communist bands
was again shown on August 21, when it
was announced that a terrorist camp
capable of accommodating between 100
and 150 people had been found in the
jungle off Betong, in Southern Thailand,
by border police. The hideout, which
showed signs of recent occupation, was
the seventh that had been found in
the past two and a half months. A
White Paper published in October,
1966, stated that “There are at present
between 500 and 600 armed members
of the Communist terrorist organisa-
tion on this border ... In addition to
these the CPM has been busy giving
guerilla training to youths in the
border area and up to 1000 of them
form a reserve which may be embodied
at short notice.” The White Paper also
mentioned that the CPM, which has
always drawn on CCP experience, is
turning what it calls its “liberated areas”
on the Malaysia-Thai border into
another “Yenan in miniature” so as to
attract and influence Communist sym-
pathisers in West Malaysia.
Another White Paper published in
autumn, 1966, described “the Com-
munist threat to Sarawak” and stated
that the Sarawak Communist organisa-
tion consisted “of over 1000 hard-core
members and has several thousand sup-
porters and sympathisers throughout
the State.”
In view of all this the Government’s
action in releasing the detainees is all
the more admirable and clear proof that
Tun Razak means what he says when
he states that he is anxious to establish
“full freedom of political expression
and activity consistent with social and
civic discipline.”

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Leaving us to the stockbrokers
By APRIL McKEE-WRIGHT
GETTING to meet Robert Hughes,
Australian-born art critic now in Lon-
don, was not easy. The afternoon was
pouring with solid British rain and the
long street of rather elegant apartment
houses looked identical. I was not quite
sure if he lived at Flat 14 in Building
4 or Flat 4 in Building 14. Not build-
ings mansions was the term. It was
certainly not Flat 14. A knock on that
door brought the sound of a slow step,
a lock being carefully unbolted and then
the door, still on its chain, opened. A
bearded face peered out. I asked for
Robert Hughes without much conviction.
“I have not heard the name,” said
the voice. “Is he a surgeon or a
physician?”
I said I felt he was probably classed
as a critic.
“You mean he is just an ordinary
person?” the man was obviously as
shocked as a superior English surgeon
can be. “We are all doctors in this
building. You would have to look for
an ordinary person somewhere else.”
When I finally found Robert Hughes
relaxing in a magnificently modern flat
filled with deep leather Finnish couches
and enormous works of art against
black walls I didn’t think ordinary was
the correct term, despite his lack of a
medical degree.
He poured whisky from an outsize
Swedish decanter. I had felt at first
that interviewing a journalist might be
a little cannibalistic, but the rarefied
atmosphere, the glimpse of his spectacu-
lar modern office through another door-
way, all reassured me.
With an agent to act for him and
Tceep the harsh sound of coin from his
■ears, and with contracts from the BBC,
writing several books at once, and off
for the weekend to Istanbul or Turkey
or Greece for the “Observer” or the
“Sunday Times,” Robert Hughes has
obviously come a fair way in the simple
art of success, since he arrived in
London in 1964.
Also he seems to have journeyed
much further than the distance between
Sydney and London on his trip. On the
way he was “badly shaken up” in the
United States, where he had very few
•contacts, and admits he was glad *to
•escape to Europe. But here confidence
in himself and his Hungry Horse exhi-
bitions faded.
“My naivety was completely flattened
by seeing the great traditionalists. I
knew there was no chance of my ever
getting even a little of that degree of
expertise and that there was no point
in burdening the world with one more
mediocre painter. So I made the
decision not to paint. I knew as I went
through those galleries that it wasn’t
in me. And it was a hard truth.
“Though England is a closed society
in one sense it is open and permeable in
the field of art,” Hughes added.
“Artistic types are often an attractive
ingredient at dinner, where many a half-
successful person finds a patron. I tried
to avoid using connections, but somehow
it is very easy to meet people in London.
“Otherwise, the opportunities in Eng-
land are, for me, so much greater than
in Australia that I couldn’t think of
Hughes... in the world of the Sunday supplements

going back even for a visit. Here I
have a decent place to live, I find the
climate quite pleasant” (a heroic state-
ment in view of the afternoon), “and
because I earn more I eat and live
better than I could do in Australia.
It costs a lot to live well in London,
but it costs a fair amount to live well
in Australia, too, and there you just
don’t earn enough.
“There are many good writers in
Australia, but it isn’t economical to stay
there. Despite Max Harris, who bleats
and carries on about staying in Aus-
tralia to write, no writer in his senses
would do it and to hell with patriot-
ism.”
Hughes feels that all this talk of
breaking off with England is hollow
and empty. There would always be an
uneasy feeling of having murdered the
parent. He thinks Australians have a
misplaced sense of national pride. That
we keep up historical fantasies and hold
up minor men as culture heroes. He
is ashamed when he reads the prices
paid for William Dobell’s work and
thinks that instead, for the same price,
we could have three Degas drawings,
a first-rate modern work or a 17th-
century Dutch painting.
Worse than that is our political pas-
sivity. In fact he thinks that we should
prove to the world that we have more
than God and LBJ on our side. Aus-
tralia to Robert Hughes, circa 1967, is
a land of opportunity only for stock-
brokers and lawyers. “London is not
just a great place to live and it
isn’t the mini-skirt that is important.
It is intellectually alive. Currents of
thoughts co-exist and there is a fer-
ment of ideas reminiscent of Paris from
1910 to 1930.”
Fermenting, in the Hughes brain at
the moment are three books one
the history of Dada and Surrealism,
another on Christian art, and the third
the long-awaited, deferred, and once
destroyed issue of “The Art of Aus-
tralia” from Penguin books. This should
be delivered by the end of the year.
He is a constant panellist on the


television program “The Art Game,” in
which a panel of artists, historians, etc.
discuss such objects as a 16th-century
Venetian bronze mask (for the BBC, of
course). Also on television he reports
on the art shows. He went to Florence
after the floods and does general feature
work for the Sunday supplements.
“They have great power these maga-
zines. It is generally believed through-
out Britain that every word written in
the “Observer” and the “Sunday Times”
is true.”
For two months he worked as an art
critic for the “Observer,” and has cov-
ered Jerusalem at Christmas for the
“Sunday Times.” This was done last
year and intended for use this Christ-
mas but God apparently didn’t tell the
“Sunday Times” about the war.
Does Robert Hughes miss us in our
isolated parochial mediocrity at all?
Only some people, fresh air, and the
beaches and that sort of thing. Cer-
tainly not our censorship. In fact he
appears to be well and truly settled.

Life's work
By ELWYN LYNN
Sidney Nolan Retrospective. Art Gal-
lery of N.S.W., Sydney.
HOWEVER DEDICATED the prevail-
ing commitment to abstraction and
however weirdly obsessive the addiction
to art shorn of literary connotations,
only the most prejudiced and biased
could fail to find some delight in the
Nolan retrospective of 143 works now
expressively displayed and accom-
panied by an impressive catalogue
at the Art Gallery of New South Wales
and destined for Nolan’s hometown,
Melbourne, on November 22 and Perth
on January 9.
Nolan is the most famous of all
Australian painters; 'he is the first Aus-
tralian to be known internationally, not,
as the knockers may say, because he is
one of the last solacing refuges of
realism, but because he has recapitu-
lated, at a time when realism’s reputa-
tion is doubtful, the case for expressive
realism and for narrative painting in
the sense that a work of art can be a
gradual aesthetic and thematic unfold-
ing.
It would be tedious to list the recur-
rent themes in Nolan’s work and I
have attempted to do it elsewhere, as
elsewhere I have noted how Nolan’s
view of the Australian landscape has
been obscured by the attention given
to his narratives, explorers, and bush-
rangers; certainly it is most rewarding
to compare the gently lyrical yellowy-
green Wimmera of 1943 with its
delicately casual placement of those
zany spherical trees with Wimmera of
1966; he had seen the Wimmera again
in 1964, somewhat through the eyes
of Corinth and Turner, and now the
almost identical scene slides in broken,
curdling dulled yellow to dark greys
and the silos, used in 1943 to give a
focal point, are now tossed up like pale
planks on a tumultous landscape. The
one-armed, wildly gesturing convict
against the indeterminate landscape of
1962, appears again as explorer, theat-
rically remonstrating before a ruddy
Dimboola landscape of 1966 or suppli-
cating before one as golden as a. Turner
in the same year. Indeed, infinite com-
parisons may be made between his later
and earlier works.
What has not struck one so forcibly
before is his varied use of color from
the almost monochromatic Central Aus-
tralian landscapes to the gloomy, grey
turbulence of Antarctica and the pierc-
ingly sweet and recklessly rich color
of the African paintings; I found it
hard to accept his Elephant and Tree,
first seen at the Adelaide Festival in
1964, because of the lurid crimson
patches that formed the earth, the trunk
raised against a tree of orange and red,
and the sky sliding like rhubarb cus-
tard. “It’s blasting like a Louis Arm-
strong trumpet,” said an onlooker, and
the color does work with the climactic
fierceness and, of course, Nolde could
hardly inhabit our faded outback.
Elsewhere the color has the gay levita-
tion that he once gave birds and farm
machinery and policemen: the grey sky
touched with faded reds in Zebra of
1963, the bitter green of the apes and
the smoky intangibility of his lone
ape, all pink bottom and fuzzy head,
have a magical lightness and ease of
touch that relate Nolan to pure painters
like Watteau and Fragonard, when the
medium was not the message.
What must astonish all are the three
masterpieces Nolan has produced since
1964, each of nine panels (60 x 48in.)
and 432 inches long the climax of a
show which emphasises his later work,
as his 1946-47 Kellys were shown in
1964 and his early collages and ab-
stracts in Rebels and Precursors in
1962; but I do miss the collages, where
Nolan says he was concerned with
formal issues and was not trying to
isolate fragments of images; the col-
lages would have demonstrated his
occasional resort to formal emphasis.
Since one could deal with this re-
trospective in only a fragmentary way
it’s perhaps best to consider the large
masterpieces: Inferno’s overlapping,
pale silhouetted, naked bodies out-
lined in charcoal are related to the
series he did called The Vanity of
Human Wishes in 1965-66 and in their
linearity to the Eureka works of 1949
and the Italian Crucifix of 1955; in
their torment they are akin to the
shadowed romantic figures of Gallipoli
of 1963 and in their buoyant curves to
the dark brown and white Leda and
the Swan, where the Swan has the
blighted grace of Nolan’s floating,
mainly armless nudes with thick, some-
times bruised heads. The over-lapping,
X-ray silhouettes drift aimlessly in a
beautiful rhythm, the thick white paint
of their bodies assisting the all-
embracing rhythmical movement. It has
much of the old levitation, but there is
nothing of the former wit and cavorting
grace, and it’s not in the open space of
outback but the enclosed space of
Sartre’s No Exit.
In Riverbend, seen in 1965 at David
Jones, space is similarly enclosed, so
much so that the trees and water seem
incandescent; there’s an eerie rustling
amid the trees above the opalescent
water and while the serenity of the
river is a foil to the Lilliputian drama
of the hunting down and death of the
trooper, the palpitating palisade of
trees, breaking into green rejuvenation
at the top, seem to symbolise tran-
sience and the cycle of the seasons and
history.
If the embracing rhythms in River-
bend occur where water meets and re-
flects the slender gums and in Inferno
with the languid drifting of women
“white as leprosy,” Glenrowan is anti-
compositional, anti-rhythmical, as it is
both aftermath of a disaster and of a
myth. The trees waft away in a dream-
scape, the hotel is a Turneresque hut,
and the recumbent Ned, occupying three
panels, melts into the brown land. The
work is held together by bands of the
celebrated Glenrowan wallpaper that
Nolan has put to so many uses and here
its uncanny severity emphasises the
faded incoherence of the landscape,
that chaotic dispersion of tree, rock,
valley and hill that has become a fea-
ture of Nolan’s latest work. In this huge
version of the fatal battle, Kelly is no
longer the frail dryad of the forest, but
a figure larger than life, marked with
“stigmata” like the woman in Inferno
or Riverina Dick in T arred and
Feathered of 1945, and now inseparable
from the land that bore him, just as
Nolan’s vision of Australia is insepar-
able from ours.

Rich Tomato Sauce
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Dirty Dozen. Director, Robert
Aldrich.
Funeral In Berlin. Director, Guy
Hamilton.
“THE DIRTY DOZEN” comes here
to the accompaniment of roars of
applause, the merry tinkle of cash
registers, and a piercing chorus of dis-
approval. In the States it is playing
to capacity houses, and MGM, evidently
hoping for the same thing in Australia,
have released it here in practically
every available theatre. The publicity
dwells on the brutality and bloodthirsti-
ness of the movie; so, less gloatingly, do
the disapproving overseas critics.
I went to see it prepared either for
the worst (a piece of sadistic indulgence
like “The Camp On Blood Island”),
or the best (a strong, outspoken anti-
brutality statement like “The Hill”).
What I got was a highly expert, rough-
and-tumble action movie.
The basic plot sounds alarming
enough. Just before D-Day, an Ameri-
can major, himself somewhat out of
favor for being vaguely “difficult” and
insubordinate, is lumbered with the
thankless task of training a dozen
soldiers for a behind-the-lines suicide
mission. His men are drawn from a
military prison where they face the
death sentence or at best long prison
terms. They’re a surly, unco-operative
lot, automatically defiant, and, natur-
ally, considering that they’ve nothing
to lose, scornful of military discipline.
Gradually they build up solidarity
among themselves and even establish
a grudging friendliness with the major,
and finally embark almost jauntily on
their bloody task.
One of the main criticisms levelled
against the movie is that it purports
to be anti-war, but in fact wallows in
war’s violence and destruction. But is
this true? I can’t imagine that Robert
Aldrich intended it to be anything but
the piece of diversion that it is. The
first half, which shows the choosing
and training of the men, is played
almost entirely for laughs (admittedly
of a rough and unsubtle kind); though
the Dozen is composed of killers,
rapists, religious maniacs, and morons,
they become (because unreal) quite
sympathetic and likable.
After this the men go off on their
real mission, but by this time Aldrich
has, surely deliberately, made it impos-
sible to believe in it except as a plausible
bit of adventure fiction. There’s plenty
of violence and mayhem, but the blood
in the earlier mock battle was, quite
frankly, tomato sauce; this is obviously
more out of the same bottle. ,
There’s a high-class cast, a tightly
constructed and often funny script, and
lively direction (though some of the
camera angles are unnecessarily fancy).
Perhaps the humor and excitement lean
heavily on physical violence this was
the basis, too, of most of the early
slapstick comedies which the movie buffs
now look back on with dewy-eyed
nostalgia.
Len Deighton’s disrespectful, low-
class spy turns up again in the coolly
attractive person of Michael Caine,
and his new movie is far below the
standard of “The Ipcress File,” one of
the most impressive of the anti-Bond
genre. Still, “Funeral In Berlin” is
very acceptable entertainment; Guy
Hamilton directs professionally, though
not particularly stylishly, and keeps the
involvements of the plot admirably
under control. The main loss is in the
character of the spy Harry Palmer,
originally the personification of self-
indulgent dumb insolence. Now he’s
developing a conscience, balks at kill-
ing an old friend, won’t even accept a
lunch invitation from the devious
Russian Colonel, and refuses a bonus
which he sees as a bribe.

Theatre Company’s production of Alan
Hop good’s “The Golden Legion of
Cleaning Women”
Theatre
Unhappy birthday
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Rules of the Game. Pirandello. St.
Martin’s, Melbourne.
PIRANDELLO was born in Sicily 100
years ago and, while his name sug-
gests a character from the Harlequin-
ade, few of his subsequent birthdays
would seem to have been happy. Fol-
lowing an arranged marriage, the two
family fortunes melted away and “a
difficult childbirth unsettled his wife’s
reason.” For the next 17 years, most of
the Pirandello dramas were hers, as,
psychotically jealous, she staged an end-
less succession of scenes. Thus Pirandello
became a confirmed pessimist, and his
early social idealism was mutated.
The central obsession in his writing
became the reality of personality
existing as he did in both the real
world and his wife’s insane perception—
and his major plays explore the roles
and games we play in the conventions
of relationships. “The Rules of the
Game” concerns an apparently self-
contained and aloof husband who re-
fuses to concern himself with his wife’s
infidelity. This provokes her to organise
a duel, in which her erect, correct
husband will be forced to defend her
honor against a consummate swords-
man. Ever courteous, her husband seems
to agree. But at the eleventh hour,
through the manipulation of convention,
he forces her lover to take his place.
Irene Mitchell’s production is abso-
lutely conventional but as the play
is an exercise in correctness and man-
ners her decision to “do it straight”
seems a wise one. While minor players
were weak (a constant problem with
productions at this theatre) the leading
players, Paul Eddey, Marcella Bur-
goyne, and Joseph James, were impres-
sive.
St. Martin’s precedes “The Rules of
the Game” with a chilling Pirandello
one-acter called “The Man with the
Flower in His Mouth.” Although two
other actors are present as props, the
play is virtually a. solo piece. Remin-
iscent of Beckett’s “Krapp’s Last Tape,”
it depicts an intense, abstracted man
facing imminent death. Only by filling
his mind with irrelevancies can he hold
his mind together. Paul Karo was com-
pelling in a difficult role.
Mixed salad
By ROBERT WARD
The Golden Legion of Cleaning
Women. Hopgood. Teachers’ College
Theatre.
Entertaining Mr. Sloane. Orton. Sheri-
dan Theatre, Adelaide.
THEATRE REVIEWING in Adelaide
at the moment is a disorienting activity.
One night Adelaide charladies take
over the world, the following night in
London a brother and sister are rivals
for the favors of their father’s rough-
neck murderer. Then next there is Noel
Coward and, on Saturday, “Winnie the
Pooh.” In several senses we’re having
theatrical salad days.
The charladies are those of Alan Hop-
good’s “The Golden Legion of Clean-
ing Women,” translated from Mel-
bourne to Adelaide with local flavor
written in. It is the second play in the
current South Australian Theatre Com-
pany season, and John Tasker’s direc-
tion intelligently brings forth much of
the play’s innocent humor.
The women use information from
their employers’ wastepaper baskets to
help them play the stock market. They
ruin several dishonest companies, amass
capital, extend their activities to Lon-
don, Peking, Moscow, increase their


political power, and donate all profits
to charity. A millionaire’s son helps
the ladies build their organisation, which
becomes a world-wide force for sub-
urban good, and he imagines he con-
trols it. He offends the women by using
their files to arrange his marriage, and
they thereupon liquidate the Legion
and return to charing.
It is not a wildly funny play, and it
is certainly an awkward one technically,
having four self-contained acting areas
used in rapid, varying succession. Pat
Fackrell’s sets solve simple spacial prob-
lems by using two elaborate revolves,
and are well designed overall, but the
play’s inherent static qualities remain.
The cast is a strong one, playing at
the right pace, obviously well disci-
plined, fully rehearsed, and altogether
in command of situations. Patricia Ken-
nedy’s head char, Lotte Tillydale, is a
little stooped, flatfooted, and frayed at
the edges. Watching her perfectly timed
performance, one remembers her
elegant, brittle Agnes in “A Delicate
Balance.” Together the two roles show
her to be an actress of remarkable range
and technical control.
The Sheridan Theatre’s current pro-
duction is a very funny “Entertaining
Mr. Sloane,” by the late Joe Orton. It
is the most enjoyably immoral play I
have seen.
Mr. Sloane is a young psychotic
bodgie, picked up and taken home by
a daft nymphomaniac, Kath, whose
invalid father, Kemp, recognises him as
the murderer of a photographer who
dabbled in male pornography and for
whom both he and Mr. Sloane worked.
Kath asks Mr. Sloane to stay, seduces
him, and is rendered pregnant. Mr.
Sloane kicks and beats Kemp regularly.
Kath’s rich brother, Ed, feels that Mr.
Sloane would make an admirable
chauffeur and gymnastic companion,
and so hires him after demanding that
Kath keep her hands off. Mr. Sloane
finally kicks Kemp to death, and the
brother and sister decide to share Mr.
Sloane on a six-monthly alternating
basis.
The play’s language is mild and
cliche-ridden, and the humor emerges
at points where lechery and violence
are dealt with in accents of simple-
minded gentility. The black core of
the comedy is the killing of Kemp, and
the action surrounding this is repul-
sively and perversely funny.
John Dick’s direction is deft and
rightly lighthearted. The set, by Mac
Dick, is nicely sombre, with a tortuous
William Morris wallpaper and
aspidistras, and strange agglutinative
covering of greenish-gold over furniture
and fittings. There is a superb Kath,
played by Paula Carter as a kind of
toothy, adenoidal Blanche de Bois. Don
Barker’s Ed is full of polite, predatory
menace. Michael Moody’s Kemp is an
unsympathetic study of galling old age.
Peter Goerecke’s Sloane is a little un-
fortunate, since he really needs to be
muscular and baby-faced. Still, it is a
creditable performance. An enjoyably
horrifying evening was had by all.
Music
Unfree market
By PAUL FROLICH
Recent Soviet Music. International
Society for Contemporary Music.
Anzac House, Sydney.
FROM TIME TO TIME there has
been clamor (in which I have partici-
pated) for a positive financial commit-
ment to the arts, particularly music, on
the part of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. In the course of a seminar on
the Soviet Union, the Sydney branch
of the International Society for Contem-
porary Music organised an evening of
Soviet Chamber Music and made me
realise how lucky we, as audiences, are
by not having this long-sought Govern-
ment support. In the absence of sub-
sidies for composers, the few of our
younger musicians who really have
something to say—Sculthorpe, Dreyfus,
Butterley, Meale, and a handful of
others write music for the open
market. If their work is to succeed,
it must be well written, interesting,
and of sufficient substance to attract a
paying audience.
In the Soviet Union, clearly, things
are different. If only a composer can
acquire the bare skills of his craft, he
is deemed a community asset, no matter
how negligible, unoriginal, and repeti-
tive his output. The poorly patronised
concert in Anzac House presented works
by five living Soviet composers, four
of whom would, I am sure, have the
greatest difficulty selling their merchan-
dise to a discriminating public. There
was a Partita for piano, by 30-year-old
Yuri Butsko, quite excellently played
by Diane Selmon, the four movements
of which ambled along amiably and
without any specific aim. Though not
modern by our standards, neither was
the music balanced by thematic wealth.
This was followed by Five Sonnets
of Shakespeare for Baritone and Piano,
by Dmitri Kabalevsky. To our ears,
Shakespeare sung in Russian is less than
ideal even though Robert Haase’s
pleasant and well-modulated voice gave
me a lot of pleasure and Miss Selmon
accompanied fastidiously and well.
Kabalevsky seemed to pay little atten-
tion to Shakespeare’s texts and, from
the music, it was hard to guess at the
content of any particular sonnet. This
was the more to be regretted as Kabal-
evsky has, in the past, written delightful
songs. On this occasion his usual wit
and invention must have run very low
and I was not impressed by his borrow-
ings from Rachmaninov and
Moussorgsky.
A Sonata for Cello Solo, by
Armenian composer Adam Khudoyan,
gave young Sydney cellist Nathan Waks
yet another opportunity for displaying
his great skill and growing musician-
ship. The sonata proved a very taxing
piece, but musically this, too, was
rather indeterminate and certainly not
comparable to, for instance, Kodaly’s
unaccompanied cello sonata.
Only in the second part of the
concert did we reap musical rewards.
The Arthur Leech String Quartet
played two late Shostakovich quartets,
No. 9 of 1964 and No. 11 of 1966.
Shostakovich is a consummate com-
poser. Nothing he writes is ever quite
negligible; he is one of those few who,
under any system, would write good
music.
Records
Britten's "Dream"
By JOHN CARGHER
A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Britten).
Alfred Deller, Elizabeth Harwood,
Peter Pears, etc. London Symphony
Orchestra (Britten). Decca SET
338/40.
SUCCESSFUL new operas are few
and far between. Only Menotti and
Britten among contemporary com-
posers have produced works which seem
likely to survive their creators. “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,” now that it
will reach broader audiences via the
medium of records, may well prove to
be Britten’s most lasting success. “Peter
Grimes” left the distinct impression
that the composer deliberately cut the
natural sweep of the music he wanted
to write, fearing accusations of being
old-fashioned and melodic. It is signifi-
cant that both Menotti and Britten
should have this gift of melody in a
day when modem composers seek to
divorce themselves from such an out-
dated idiom. The poor balance be-
tween the “melodic” and “modern”
styles of “Peter Grimes” is completely
absent in Britten’s “Dream.” The
melodies are still there, if less drama-
tic as is only to be expected. There
may not be a wealth of conventional
set pieces (though there are some) but
the progression from aria to recitative
to orchestral interlude is achieved with
such smoothness that the action and
music flow uninterrupted. Given the
immense stage potential of Shake-
speare’s fairy land, Britten’s opera
should prove big box office, in fact it
has proved so already and the Eliza-
bethan Trust would do well to con-
sider it for production.
The performance on disc is all that
could be reasonably expected and a
lot more. With the composer in charge,
this must be accepted as the authori-
tative version, though it is not made
clear which of the two originals is
followed. I assume it is the Covent
Garden one; the forces assembled ap-
pear too large for the Aldeburgh ver-
sion. The huge cast works wonders
with the actual Shakespeare lines which
have been edited into a workable
libretto by Britten with the help of
Peter Pears. There is quite literally
no weak, member among the 20 prin-
cipals listed.

It’s only 50 years ago that Electrolytic
Zinc Company produced the first high
grade zinc in Australia now each
year Australia uses more zinc per head
of population than any other country
in the world. Around twice as much in
fact. In that time E.Z.’s experience,
its attention to product quality and
service, and its development of valuable
overseas markets have made it a great
earner for Australia and Australians.
E.Z. plans to keep it that way.

BUSINESS AND AND FINANCE
The national importance of
Bass Strait oil
IF THE BASS STRAIT oil discoveries
turn out to be as good as they look it’s
not only BHP shareholders who should
be tossing their hats in the air, but the
whole country. The economic implica-
tions of a series of offshore oilfields that
could quite easily meet one-third of
Australia’s total oil demand within five
to six years and that could, accord-
ing to Victoria’s ebullient Mr. Bolte,
eventually supply Australia’s petroleum
needs are very great indeed.
The two existing producing oilfields
in Australia at Moonie and Barrow
Island are very small indeed compared
with the Bass Strait bonanza. Moonie
has reserves of only about 27 million
barrels, Barrow Island has about 114
million (with the prospect of another
oilfield on neighboring Pasco Island),
but already there are estimates that in
the smallest of BHP-Esso’s oil structures,
the Marlin field, there are reserves of
500 million barrels. This leaves the
prospect of much higher reserves in both
Kingfish, which had a flow rate of 1500
barrels a day in its test well compared
with 700 to 1200 a day in tests on
Marlin, and in the latest Halibut dis-
covery where a staggering flow rate of
3230 barrels a day was recorded last
week. .
So far in Bass Strait, the BHP-Esso
partnership has discovered three major"
oil reserves, one huge gas field, is now
about to test what could be another oil-
field in the “Dolphin” structure and
will then move further around the coast
off South Australia to test the “Cray-
fish” structure. The national import-
ance of these oil finds is not only that
they will make Australia increasingly
less dependent on foreign supplies of
oil, but that the balance of payments
will benefit markedly, so enabling our
pace of economic advance to speed up.
IMF Report
World recession
THE ANNUAL REPORT from the
International Monetary Fund empha-
sises how marked has been the recent
slowdown in the world economy and
how important it is for the primary
producing countries, so dependent on
demand for their exports, that there
should be an early pickup in the activity
of the industrial countries.
The IMF doesn’t take its hard figur-
ing beyond the first quarter of the year,
but points out that in those months the
combined industrial production of North
America, Germany, and Britain was as
much as 4 percent below what it had
been in the same months of 1966. Even
the 10 percent gain recorded by the
combined strengths of France, Italy, and
Japan did not prevent a dip in the out-
put index for all the industrial countries
taken together.
So far, the outstanding feature of
the policies to effect a more normal
rate of growth in industrial countries
BHP-Esso’s Bass Strait fields
has been, as the IMF report points out,
“the widespread retreat from the tight
monetary policies and higher interest
rates of 1966.” While approving of this
reversal, the IMF cautions that it should
not be taken too far and says again, as
it did last year, that fiscal measures
should play a bigger part. On the other
hand, it is conceded that Britain dealt
with last year’s sterling crisis by bring-
ing in fiscal and incomes-policy
measures, rather than monetary ones.
And yet where has this taken Britain?
There is nothing particularly new in
the IMF’s advice. That to Britain is to
keep an incomes policy more effective
than any of its competitors; to Germany
to encourage capital outflows to offset,
at least in part, the large current
surplus; and to the United States to
follow, not lead, any further decline in
interest rates in order to hold down its
payments deficit.
The value of the report is that it
emphasises the chronic dependence of
the developing countries on their richer
trading partners: for instance, it points
out that there was scarcely any increase
in the import purchasing power of the
agricultural producers between 1965 and
1966 and this has probably been reduced
this year. Although official grants and
loans to the poorer countries did rise a
little in 1966, there was an appreciable
slackening in private capital inflow, in
part because of the British and Ameri-
can restraints on capital movements
but in part because of the lack of
confidence that the national policies
followed by the less developed coun-
tries will result in economic growth.
With the international liquidity
debate solved for the time being, it is
to be hoped that this week’s joint annual
meeting of the IMF and World Bank,
which starts in Rio de Janeiro, will con-
centrate on the problems of the under-
developed countries.
Victoria's Budget
Business on edge
THE CARDS BEING nicely stacked
for the Bolte Budget this year (by, of
all people, the Federal Treasurer), Sir
Henry got applause from Canberra for
doing its neglected tax work for it.
But at the same time he set the busi-
ness world on edge as it tried to meas-
ure the effects of what looked like a
new tax on turnovers and wages which
could hardly fail to increase costs and
drive business and investment inter-
state.
Unfortunately Sir Henry’s Budget
speech only announced the impost in
the broadest terms as a proposed
basic review of exemptions from stamp
duty (the major item of State tax-
ation revenue), in which a flat rate of
one cent for every $lO or part thereof
will be adopted. Sir Henry wouldn’t
articulate and, though it emerged last
week that wages would come under it,
the full range would not be known for
some days.
Taxation experts consider that, be-
cause business will be able to claim
their payments as tax allowable in
assessing company tax, they will get off
lighter than wage earners who have no
such alleviating escape routes. More-
over, business will doubtless contrive
to pass the new tax on as far as they
can.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy : The Australian Resources De-
velopment Bank is formed by eight local trading banks, and
with Reserve Bank support. It will “operate on a commercial
basis providing finance for Australian enterprises engaged in
development of natural resources,” proposing to borrow
funds both locally and overseas.
Listed Australian companies raised only $35.6m. in new
share and debenture capital during the June quarter the
lowest quarterly amount since the Statistician’s records began
in 1959; the March quarter raisings had totalled $66.5m.
The Federal Government is to raise s3sm. on the London
market the first London loan in four years; coupon
interest will be 7 percent, to yield 7.11 percent at an issue
price of 99.
For the markets : It became an oil boom based upon
one stock on Australian share markets. Elsewhere, some
major miners grew stronger and industrials stayed quite
firm.
Equities in London managed to advance at the end after
a midweek reaction to the August trade figures . . . Wall
Street still looks fairly mixed on moderate dealings.
For companies :It was pretty obviously BHP’s week,
and not only because of the decorous, though wide-ranging,
annual meeting. Investment and economic excitement greeted
Halibut’s flow, the highest so far in Australia and well
above Moonie. Then it couldn’t have been quite anti-climax
to hear Sir Colin Syme talk, inter alia, about a possible
issue in 1968 “to finance expansion of iron and steel pro-
duction and allied activities” and a decision, “at this stage,”
not to form a separate organisation for oil and gas interests.
Not far behind in claiming attention came the Power
Corporation’s $4.40 a share offer to secure 51 percent of
Mount Morgan. That company’s directors mention the
“substantially foreign” approach, will not sell their own
shares, and recommend non-acceptance.
Hot on these two main attractions arrived more optimistic
statements from Western Mining on its Kambalda nickel,
together with the likelihood of building both a smelter and
refinery.
The same kind of cheer didn’t flow from Mount Isa,
whose profit slipped 29 percent to $12,523,163 and whose
dividend thereby went back from 16 to 10 percent; little
relief from mining problems is expected during the current
year . . . New Broken Hill also believes its earnings will
go 10 percent lower for the 1967 year.
Financiers of various sorts appeared uniformly happy ...
Commercial Union Assurance sped earnings from $1,539,126
to $1,696,487 and the dividend (as of habit) from 9 to 10
percent . . . The English, Scottish and Australian Bank hqld
a 10 percent rate when profit rose 18.2 percent to a peak
$4,164,062; earning rate goes to 21.1 percent on higher capi-
tal .. . Two money market operators, AMP Discount
Corporation and Trans-City Discount reacted very favorably
to better bond trading conditions . . . Trade Credits put on
$22,183 to reach $223,411 and brought dividend from 15
to percent.
Motor and allied industries are beginning to look healthier
... so much so that parts maker Repco plans a 1-for-10
issue at 100 percent premium, to raise $3.88m. for further
expansion . . . Sydney Holden dealer W. H. Lober recovered
some ground by shifting profit from $44,886 to $80,393 . . »
In Melbourne, Noske Industries, which also mills flour,
pushed earnings up by $66,912 to $269,973 . . . Dwyers
Motors, in Wollongong, kept fairly steady at $143,671.
Retailer Waltons benefited from tax losses so profit
climbed 17 percent to $3,257,650 . . . Heavy engineer Com-
eng drifted from $1,242,856 to $1,141,042, mainly because
of a 19.5 percent decline in South Africa . . . Schweppes
(Aust.) crept up by $5874 to $703,770, while hard liquor
gave Lindeman and Castlemaine Perkins rather bigger boosts
. . . Australian Newsprint retreated a little, but kept to its
10 percent.
MEN AND MATTERS
WILDCATTING MAY be more
expensive fun than production drill-
ing in the oil search game, but Roy
Richter, managing director of the
joint Australian-Canadian company
Richter Bawden which has landed the
contract to drill Esso-BHP’s develop-
ment wells in the Marlin and Barra-
couta off-shore gas fields, has had his
fair share of both. Name an oil explora-
tion show that’s been wildcatting on the
mainland or in Papua these past 30
years and it is a fifty-fifty chance he’s
handled its drilling bits at some time
or other. Latterly, though, with the
finding of commercial fields, he’s been
concentrating on production drilling and
at the moment one or other of his com-
pany’s nine rigs are in action on Barrow
Island and Moonie as well as at Roma.
In January three others will be perched
on fixed platforms drilling the first of 20
gas producers in Bass Strait.
Richter started as a driller in Papua
with Australasian Petroleum in the
’thirties before becoming a bomber pilot
with the RAAF. After the war he
returned to Papua and for a while was
with D’Arcy Exploration in Britain, then
back here again as AAO’s drilling super-
intendent at Roma and with its sub-
sidiary Mines Administration as general
field manager. With all that experience
under the belt, AAO backed him in set-
ting up his own drilling business, taking
a half-interest and bringing in Peter
Bawden and his teams of experts and
roughnecks from Canada, a lot of whom
are still on the job. At present on
Barrow Island, the company is drilling
roughly a well every three days and
expects to drill about half a million feet
in holes scattered over the Common-
wealth this year alone.
MAKING TEN TIMES its theoretical
original stake is not all that Speculator’s
Diary has done for the four people who
have written it at various times in its
eight years’ life. This week’s news of
Mr. A. R. Elmslie joining in partner-
ship with Mr. John Valder in Valder
and Co., a member firm of the Sydney
Stock Exchange, means that two former
“Speculators” are now on the Stock
Exchange—Mr. Valder as a member
and Mr. Elmslie as a non-member
partner.
Mr. Valder, who began his firm on
March 1 this year, had been a journalist
before going into stockbroking and had
written Speculator’s Diary for two years
A. R. Elmslie
Roy Richter
before Mr. Elmslie took over from him
for almost five years. But 30-year-old
Bob Elmslie’s background was far more
commercial; after matriculating from
Barker College, he worked for a while
with ICIANZ and Claude Neon while
doing accountancy (he is an AAS A,
ACIS) and then went to England and
Canada, where he worked with one of
Canada’s largest investment dealers,
Wood Gundy and Co.
What about the other two “Specula-
tors”? The first one is now Finance
Editor of The Bulletin; the present one
is working in a merchant banking
organisation—and we have great hopes
for him!

BY FAR THE MOST far-reaching of
the criticisms of the new Trade
Practices Act is Dr. Geoffrey Walker’s
“Australian Monopoly Law” a book
that draws as much on the author’s
experience in a New York law firm
dealing in anti-trust laws as in his
experience as a former lecturer in law
at Sydney University.
Walker starts from the historical fact
of failure the failure of the Consti-
tution to establish the Australian Com-
mon Market which was the ideal of
the founders of the Federation. Customs
barriers between the colonies disap-
peared with Federation, but 70 years
later trade associations and private
controls had replaced them. Today
interstate trade is only a small part
of Australian trade, and although we
formed the Commonwealth to get the
maximum benefits of free enterprise and
free trade, only South America, an
unlikely model for economic conserva-
tives, is as tolerant of monopoly and
restriction as Australia has seemed to
be. Thirteen basic industries are con-
trolled by single-firm monopolies and
several hundred private enterprise trade
associations operate anti-enterprise trade
restrictions.
The wars and the Depression
strengthened the preference of business
for restrictive mateship rather than for
enterprise, and the indifference of the
public (after all, Australia has had no
American-style robber barons), the
timidity of investors (after all, they lost
a lot in incompetent ventures) and
interlocking directors (why compete
with oneself?) clinchfed an Australian
slide to business restriction. It also
received intellectual backing from
common-law judges who prefer “reason-
able” restriction to freedom (“the readi-
ness of courts to prevent restraint of
trade varies inversely with their devo-
tion to common law”) and from some
economists who developed the theory
that Australia, with its small popula-
tion and market, needs monopolies
(which is only true if you say how
much monopoly and in what industries).
Dr. Walker illustrates his thesis with
a series of examples along the lines
of the paradigm case of Robertson and
Philips, which was debated in the Fed-
eral Parliament late in 1965.
Against this background we now have
the Trade Practices Act, and the basic
texts for public understanding of it:
J. E. Richardson’s “Australian Trade
Practices Act” is an essential business-
man’s handbook of the Act; P. H.
Lane’s “The Trade Practices Act. Its
Constitutional Operation” gives the
legal and constitutional foundations of
the Act (“I have sought to bolster the
Act, not to start mischievous doubts
unless existing law has driven me”);
and George Masterman and Ezekiel
Solomon have met the lawyers’ need
for a comprehensive practice book in
the new field with their “Australian
Trade Practices Law.”
But Dr. Walker’s remains the most
critical book and the one aimed at the
widest market. He believes the Act will
succeed in its historic object of creating
an Australian Common Market. But
in the light of his American experience
he claims it does not go far enough.
He dismisses two of the most common
criticisms of the Act that it will
not be effective \yithout complementary
State Acts, and that the register of
restrictive practices is not open to the
public. As to the States, he argues that,
even in the unlikely event of no State
enacting complementary legislation, the
Federal Act will encourage interstate
trade. For example, if price-fixing
remained lawful in all States, but exam-
inable in interstate trade, then Vic-
torian producers, seeing, say, a large
Queensland market with fixed high
prices, would capture the market by
selling there cheap and, protected by
the Federal Act, would be free from
interference from Queensland trade
associations. As for the Register not
being public, Walker believes that its
technical and euphemistic language
would in any case reveal little to the
layman and would rarely provide lively
copy for the reporter. On the other
hand, the dramatic publicity of the
court hearing would operate a real
deterrent, and this is the guts of the
matter.
Dr. Walker’s own criticisms of the
Act are more radical, if not always
convincing. He is best on registration
and penalties. He believes that under
the present Act registration will not
be full and frank a safe and fair
prediction. _ Registration will only be
reliable if it is backed up by investi-
gators a basic example of the point
that the Act will only work if the
Government wants it to. He also dis-
misses as trivial the penalty of $2OOO
for not duly registering a registrable
agreement especially when the
penalty would be incurred by a cor-
poration not by its directors or em-
ployees. He contrasts the Australian
penalty with the European penalty of
up to SU.S.I million for violations of
the cartel law. Again this seems a
sound criticism: no doubt many cor-
porations in these “image-conscious”
days would rather obey the Act than
incur even a small fine; nevertheless, the
case for raising the penalty seems un-
answerable.
But Dr. Walker is less persuasive on
his most radical criticisms. He wants,
above all, to see more outright prohibi-
tions in the Act. Only collusive tender-
ing and bidding are at present inexcus-
able. He wants horizontal price-fixing,
market sharing, collective boycotts and
inducing refusal to deal, and predatory
price-cutting to be also inexcusable.
All these practices are, of course, exam-
inable under the Act, but outright
prohibition of them would probably be
both unsuccessful and undesirable —•
unsuccessful because the defendant’s
guilt would have to be shown beyond
a reasonable doubt, while the defendant
would properly use all the rules of
evidence to avoid self-incrimination,
knowing that even a shadow of doubt
would save him; undesirable because
some of these practices are in the public
interest: BHP, to make up a case,
sells steel cheap in Australia. This serves
among other things to keep Krupp’s or
Kaiser’s out. Is this predatory price-
cuttings, and should it therefore be pro-
hibited? Is it not also clearly in the
public interest?
But if his case for increasing the
number of prohibited, as distinct from
examinable, practices is not accepted
some of his other criticisms which
depend on it carry less weight. He
claims that the alternative to prohibi-
tion adopted by the Act that is,
registration and case-by-case investiga-
tion is bound to be costly and cum-
bersome, that it allows too big a loop-
hole in the defence of “public interest,”
and that it may operate only after the
harm (for example, wiping out a com-
petitor) is done. These are impressive
criticisms, yet if an exhaustive range
of prohibitions is undesirable, what
other alternative is there? Is not the
existing Act with its weaknesses prefer-
able to series of unworkable and dam-
aging prohibitions?
The basic factor will always be the
Government’s determination to make
the Act Work and there can, as
Walker agrees, be no serious doubt that
it is determined to. Meanwhile, Dr.
Walker’s book should be compulsory
reading for all investigators and admin-
istrators of the Act.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
A clear diagnosis
on matters
of overheating
BY J. C. HORSFALL
FOR HIS FIRST-UP effort as chair-
man of Australian United Corpora-
tion’s annual meeting, Mr. C. T. Looker
did some very useful roving around the
national financial packs. Though the
Australian interest in the company has
been greatly diluted by the Potter sell-
out to the Americans, it is heartening
that at least Looker, Sir lan’s full
forward for so many years, is still there
to put the boot into the authorities
when occasion demands from year to
year, after the Federal Treasurer and
the Governor of the Reserve Bank have
said their annual set pieces. This role
could hardly be taken on by one of the
overseas interests which have gained
control of this Potter brainchild, now
the biggest complex in the money
markets.
Maybe Looker was taking a punt on
some of the present economic impon-
derables like the prospects for capital
inflow and the balance of payments,
biy, then so have a lot of people in
recent weeks, including Mr. McMahon
and Dr. Coombs. Where Looker scored
is that he seems to have dug somewhat
deeper than most and has come up with
a clearer diagnosis, with his wishes not
governing his judgment.
Being a close observer of pressures on
resources, this column senses from his
address that Looker may now not be
as sanguine as he appeared to be on
Budget night, in an off-the-cuff TV
interview, that these will not rise to
the point of upsetting the Budget’s
objective of giving free rein to the
private sector. He now puts in the rider
that the attainment of the objective
of giving precedence to the private
sector will depend on the availability of
resources and, as he looks around the
resources and related pressure fronts, he
finds the coasts far from clear. He
dismisses the possibility that overheat-
ing will occur in the first half of this
financial year and one can agree with
him on that. But he says such a situa-
tion “might just” develop during the
second half of the year. I would put
it rather stronger.
One of his angles on this is that he
thinks “it can be anticipated that
lagging investment expenditure will
respond to an established recovery in
business activity.” Unlike Mr.
McMahon when he was framing his
Budget, Mr. Looker has seen the de-
pressed figures for industrial capital
expenditure for the June quarter and
could be thinking of the scope for a
big improvement implied by them. He
doesn’t seem to be worrying about
hurrying it along. Nor is he suggesting,
as the Treasurer did when he saw them,
that the Budget could have been made
more expansionary in the light of them.
The trend in fixed capital investment
is certainly going to have a critical
influence on whether overheating de-
velops in the second half of the year.
It seems to me at this stage the
Treasurer should be keeping his fingers
crossed that the revival in investment
Mr. Looker is confidently expecting is
a very gradual one. Indeed, the lull in
retail spending in July, after several
lively months, now rather suggests that
it will be. Against that, the August
imports bill was so high that (in the
absence of details) one should at least
take into account the possibility that
it reflects a strong recovery in invest-
ment in the current quarter.
Mr. Looker was more hopeful than
either the Treasurer in his Budget
speech and Dr. Coombs in his annual
report on the outlook for the balance
C. T. Looker: judgment, not wishes
of payments. But says he is “forced to
speculate whether the elements of for-
tuitousness and resilience, which have
come to our aid in recent years, will be
needed this year.” So far as trade goes
he comes out on the side of the angels,
yet not without throwing in the thought
that if a strong adverse swing in trade
develops “the authorities would be
quick to act with monetary measures
before significant damage is done to
our foreign-exchange reserves.”
He seems to have a sneaking feeling
that the restrictions on capital outflow
imposed a couple of years ago by
Britain and the U.S. could have a
delayed effect. “These restrictions have
been in force for some time,” he stated,
“and they have not yet resulted in
serious damage to our balance of pay-
ments; this perhaps is due more to the
fact that the flow of capital from the
U.S. and Britain in 1966 and 1967 has
been in respect of projects which were
in the pipeline before the restrictions
became fully effective than to wishful
thinking that the restrictions were in-
effective. The fact that more overseas
capital reached Australia last year
($530m.) than in 1964-65 ($480m.),
before the restrictions, should not be
overlooked, but at the same time too
much reliance should not be placed
on the comparison, for when restrictions
are put into force it often takes time
before you feel the bite.”
This gave Mr. Looker a lead into a
subject very dear indeed to AUC’s
heart, as one of its executives reminded
us in Canberra earlier in the year
that is, the borrowing of overseas cor-
porations on the Australian capital
market. The dearth of fixed-interest
borrowing by such companies lately had
prompted the thought that the Treasury
had been getting tougher, in fact virtu-
ally impassable in this direction lately.
So it wasn’t surprising Looker said that
“a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation
has developed” in the Treasury’s inter-
pretation of the guidelines Mr. Holt, as
the then Treasurer, laid down in 1965
to govern this type of borrowing. He
dubbed the Treasury’s intervention “an
arbitrary and somewhat vague capital-
issues control” and called on the
authorities to redefine in a more posi-
tive way their earlier generalised state-
ment. If nothing else, this highlighted
the fact that an increasing number of
overseas corporations are feeling the
effect of the U.S. and British capital
export curbs and are threatened with
capital starvation unless the Treasury
lets up somewhat.
Looker made a poignant plea on their
behalf which was laced with the recogni-
tion that these types are übiquitous on
the Australian industrial scene, just as
solidly part of the structure as locally
owned concerns and indeed involve in
a lot of cases substantial Australian
equity participation.
If this is something for the Treasurer
to think about, Mr. Looker also made
a rather more technical pass in the
direction of Dr. Coombs, who should
take the mark. While welcoming the
recent issue of 180-day Treasury bills
as a valuable adjunct to the short-term
money market’s permissible holdings of
securities, Mr. Looker made pleas for
an increase in its permissible holdings
of commercial bills and for the reissue
of discounted 90- and 180-day Tieasury
Notes, which the Reserve Bank buys in
ahead of their maturity dates. “If these
could be reissued by the Reserve Bank,”
Looker says, “much greater flexibility
would be achieved by this market,
which is so dependent on fine margins.”
No doubt the good Doctor will oblige
in his own good time, but in the mean-
time, as we suggested recently, AUC
has been doing pretty well in the short-
term money market and would now
seem to have rather more than a fifth
of its total business.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
A plunge into
the giddy
"penny" market
EVER WONDERED how debits and
credits came into being? I hadn’t until
the other day, when I came across a
magazine article which gave a possible
clue. The article referred to a 16th-
century publication called “Model of
Accounting,” by one Mathias Schwartz,
of Augsburg. The book explains that,
when a ledger lies open in front of you
and you look down on it, the side where
you have your heart is the left or debit
side (where incomings are recorded).
The side away from your heart is the
receipt or credit side (where outgoings
are recorded). Makes sense, doesn’t it?
Incidentally, the chap who wrote the
book was well and truly on the ball.
He described accounting as “the rich-
making art.”
On the subject of being rich, I
wonder why Mr. Blaiklock, the chair-
man of Concrete Industries Monier,
decided to make his shareholders some
15 percent poorer with his Press con-
ference of two weeks ago. It seems
to me that it would have been better
all round if his announcements could
have waited (after all, they weren’t that
urgent) until the annual general meet-
ing, which is not far away, anyhow. By
then at least some of the company’s
claims against the U.S. Navy could
have been settled in cold hard cash and
the overall situation would probably
have been clarified a bit further. Don’t
think that I’m against shareholders
being kept fully informed at all times;
I’m not, but I do think that chairmen
should time their announcements to
give shareholders the maximum benefits.
Over recent months the “penny”
share market has been such a good one
for me that I’ve decided to give it
another whirl. This time the company
is in the oil business. Its name is Amal-
gamated Petroleum and its chairman
is Mr. H. M. H. Sleigh, of petrol fame.
The company’s shares are real cheapies
so much so that a one-cent rise can
represent a healthy profit. A two-cent
rise calls for champagne. Right now
the shares, which are historically subject
to wide price fluctuations, are down
closer to the lower rung of their price
ladder than the higher. This point alone
was enough for me to consider taking
a plunge purely on a technical basis.
However, these shares have something
more to offer. They have a reasonable
slice of security. In this case security
is a 15-year gas contract. The gas,
which is contracted at the rate of
600,000 cubic feet a day, will go to
Associated Pipelines Ltd. These are the
people who are building the Roma-
Brisbane pipeline which will, by all
accounts, be in the piping business by
1969.
In addition to all this, Amalgamated
still has the speculative element to its
make-up, because of its exploration
side. Drilling is currently being carried
out at both off-shore and on-shore
locations and there is always the chance
(though an uncertain one) that a
decent strike could turn the company’s
“penny” shares into “dollar” shares.
Actually, one of the company’s drilling
ventures soon to be undertaken is in
the Combarngo area, which by a coin-
cidence just happens to be adjacent to
the self-same pipeline mentioned above.
That would be a handy one if it
comes off.
A company that seems to have pulled
it off is L. J. Hooker. The latest result
indicates that it is finally back on an
even keel and the fact that the shares
have again reached par would indicate
that shareholders think so, too. Direc-
tors expect to start paying dividends
at the end of the 1967-68 year and will
no doubt be continuing to strive hard
to preserve their new “conservative
and mature” image, for which they
have struggled on desperately over
recent years. Although this is not a
speculative stock, it could be one worth
considering as a term investment.

By JASON
WE REALLY DIDN’T have to wait for
the Commonwealth Statistician to tell
us that the new issue market had a
lean time in the June quarter. Men in
the firms who handle the business
haven’t been lunching out for some time.
Nor, for that matter, should the Federal
Treasurer have been ignorant of the
trend in fixed capital expenditure in
the June quarter when he was coming
up to the Budget in mid-August. Obvi-
ously he hasn’t been making the right
phone calls.
These two economic indicators don’t
necessarily do the same sort of things
these days when companies have come
to rely more on their cash flows than
on the market for fresh funds; but at
least up to June the dearth of deben-
tures issues, especially by overseas cor-
porations, tells the same sort of story as
Mr. Archer’s capital expenditure figures.
And if the continued reduced state of
the debenture issue market, coupled
with Mr. C. T. Looker’s beef against
the vagueness of the official guidelines
for borrowings by overseas corporations,
is considered, then capital expenditure
is still in a reduced state.
Going on the mere smattering of new
company share issues (and the same
applies to fixed-interest ones) in recent
weeks, capital investment generally is
still very sluggish, except, of course, in
the mining sector. Repco’s one-for-ten
issue at 100 percent premium on the 50
cent par shares, to raise $3.9 million
from shareholders, is the biggest one for
some time in Melbourne. Although this
company is operating at a record profit
level and probably needs at this stage
to supplement working capital as well
as finance expansion, it also recently
bought out its partners in the U.K.
concern Kerry-Repco and changed its
name to Repco Automotive Equipment
(U.K.) Ltd. Also in the motor-parts
and accessories business, Brooklands
(Holdings) Ltd. came up with a one-
for-five issue of 50 cents ordinaries at
25 cents premium to raise $421,105 and
K. G. Luke Group Industries with a
one-for-ten issue of $1 ordinaries at
$1.25 to bring in $332,177.
There’s not much else about in the
way of new issues at the moment, nor
any sign of this sector of the market
livening up. Some companies pondering
new issues might now consider making
them, if only because BHP has an-
nounced its intention to make an issue
next year.
All told there are only about 15
new share issues on the way from
local non-mining companies; there are
more bonus share issues than cash rais-
ing ones on the stocks at present. And
apart from one or two moderately large
cash raisings, like Associated Securiti-
ties, the Commercial Banking Co. of
Sydney, and Henry Jones, most of the
new issues pending aim to raise fairly
small amounts of cash. Yet the present
time gives probably the clearest indica-
tion of the pace of company cash
raising, for the traditionally flush
liquidity season from September to
November has always been the most
popular time for companies to approach
the market. A lack of interest at pre-
sent seems to suggest that capital rais-
ing may be slack for quite a while.
This has side benefits to the stock-
market, however. It means that invest-
ible funds will not be drained off into
new issues and will therefore be more
likely to express themselves as increasing
demand for good quality stocks. This
may have already helped explain why
the market has been able to rise so far
in recent times despite the reduced role
of foreign portfolio investors. In this
situation, it seems likely that companies
making new share issues may generally
prove cheaper buying cum-issue than
during rights trading, as the existence
of a rights market may now prove a
stimulus to buying rather than the
drag it had been so many times in
recent years when liquidity was so tight.
So there could be some merit in having
a good look at the companies now pre-
paring to make issues.
THERE IS NO BELL that rings when
a stock hits the bottom, but investors
could find it worthwhile to have a good
look at the Peters group of companies
around Australia. All of them are at
or near their lowest for quite some
time, having reported generally dismal
results for 1966-67. But for each of
them the outlook is brighter and
each should come out with much im-
proved results for the current year.
They were all hit by the ice-cream war,
the intensity of which seems to have
subsided; two of them also felt the
blast of some icy competition in the
frozen-food business, which also shows
some signs of improving.
And each of them can be bought
very cheaply, indeed: Consolidated
Milk Industries, the N.S.W. Peters
company, is now selling at 56 cents for
the 50 cent shares, only a little above
its lowest for the year and well down
from its high point of 96 cents, Peters-
ville from Victoria is near its low point
at 39 cents for the 20 cent shares, well
down from 55 cent peak, and Peters
W.A., at $1.20, is a fair way below its
best level for the year of $1.73. In the
mean-time, the dividend yield from
Petersville is an acceptable 6.4 percent
and from Peters W.A. is 5.2 percent,
The Chartist says:
TELEVISION CORPORATION is a share where there is still good recovery
potential. The long-term trend shows a decline from a high point of $7.50 in 1960
to a low of $2.08 in 1966, which was the beginning of a 40 percent uptrend con-
firmed several months ago. A short-term rise to about $4.20 is likely, where there
would be considerable resistance selling from the 1962/63 range of trading in that
area. However, the overall base suggests an eventual recovery close to $5.60,
where the situation would call for re-assessment. Last sale price on 12/9/67 $3.90.

group these days, says its fall in earn-
ing rate from 19.3 percent to 15.5 per-
cent (to cover a percent divi-
dend) was due to “abnormal weather,
irrational competition,- and increasing
operating costs” in the June half-year.
At least on two of those scores things
are improving. But even though the
ice-cream section of the business is
apparently becoming more rewarding,
things are still very tough in frozen
foods, so Petersville’s recovery may well
be a modest one this year.
Peters W.A., which should be facing
a rapidly increasing market in view of
all the developments in W.A., reported
lower profits on higher capital after
increasing its sales, and patted itself
on the back for diversifying into so
many other food lines outside milk
products, as these subsidiaries earned
more than the parent company.
And for Consolidated Milk Indus-
tries, “the main contributing factor to
the reduced profit (down 56 percent
with a dividend cut from 11 percent
to 4 percent) was severe price cutting
competition in the ice-cream trade.
Wholesale prices were approximately
50 percent lower than those two years
earlier.” But the company maintained
its market share, which is important
now that the British Tobacco group,
which had been playing merry hell
with prices in this business, seems to
have decided it has had enough of the
price war. Consolidated Milk reports
that “small increases in wholesale
prices to supermarkets and other out-
lets took place during the closing stages
of the financial year and beginning of
the current year. There is some evi-
dence that this could point to the
return of more normal trading condi-
tions and that ice-cream prices have
now passed their low point.”
So, provided its exports continue high
and its baking and commercial refriger-
ation diversifications continue success-
fully, Consolidated Milk Industries
should be back on a better dividend
basis by the end of the current year.
WESTERN MINING Corporation will
probably be one of the first big Aus-
tralian mining organisations to benefit
from the new Australian Resources De-
velopment Bank, and so manage to keep
its rich nickel reserves in Australian
hands. Despite guarded comments by
chairman Lindesay Clark at Kambalda’s
official opening last week, The
Bulletin’s W.A. correspondent says
there is little doubt that WMC not only
plans to go ahead with plans both to
refine and smelt its nickel, but that it
will do so without calling in overseas
financial help.
The smelter, which will probably be
built in the Kwinana area near Perth,
is likely to have a nickel production
capacity of 14,000 tons annually fol-
lowing a report from U.S. engineering
consultants Bechtel Corporation. This
would produce about $25 million worth
of nickel a year at current prices of
about $1750 a ton. This is going to cost
a lot of money. The company would
have to spend about $5 million a year
for five years to do it all. For the
smelter would cost about $lO million,
the refinery (at Kambalda) would be
another $6 to $7 million, a power plant
at Kambalda would add a further $3
million, and then it would cost some-
thing like $2 million to increase the
water supply from 100,000 gallons to
850,000 gallons a day.
So it will probably be 1972 before
the smelter and all its associated works
are completed. Cash flow from ore
exports will go part of the way toward
financing these developments, but this
means that shareholders could not
expect any increase in dividends before
the early 1970 s when the capital works
will be completed.
The company apparently hopes to
retain its equity in its nickel despite
the cost of all these developments and
is believed to intend to approach the
new development bank.
Of the 14,000 tons of nickel a year
that would be produced from the
smelter (assuming a four percent nickel
grade and a 70 percent recovery from
the mill’s throughput of 500,000 tons
of ore), Sumitomo of Japan has con-
tracted to take 4000 tons on long-term
contract. In the meantime, the com-
pany’s nickel ore reserves continue to
increase. They are now around 5.5 mil-
lion tons, having been increasing at the
rate of not less than 300,000 tons a
month since June, and the ore body now
appears to go all the way under Lake
Lefroy. Next month a. second mill will
increase ore throughput from its present
rate of 117,000 tons a year, and a pro-
posed third mill will eventually lift it
to 500,000 tons.

The Melbourne market
BHP whets the issue appetite
WPIAT WITH THIS and that, BHP
shareholders should be the happiest mob
in the land, their cup overflowing. That
at the latest count means one in every
130 of us, not counting the foreigners.
Musing about it at the meeting, there
seemed plenty of present blessings. The
latest oil strike, assuring a third, and
on the face of it biggest, oilfield in
Bass Strait; the more than doubling of
the share price since last year’s affair
in the South Melbourne Town Hall, not
counting the lift going on during this
meeting when the shares were hovering
between $13.50 and $14.00; the healthy
increase in last year’s profits and divi-
dend (which took $24.1 million or some
$2.6 more on the year); the record steel
output, now well above six million tons
and geared to higher levels. And now,
at the meeting, Sir Colin Syme’s broad
hint that a new share issue could be in
the offing.
But for a visitor from New Zealand
(of all places because Sir Colin inti-
mated BHP’s exports to that country
were threatened by the new State-
sponsored steel company) all this and
more were not enough. The man was
Mr. A. P. Fairy. He’d said a lot of
unwise and unfounded words at the
previous annual meeting and now he
came up with the idea (stolen from a
presently subdued Mr. Shepherd, pre-
sumably content with the year’s capital
gains in his shares) that BHP should
revalue its assets and capitalise the
surplus on present book values in the
shape of a big bonus issue. All well and
good intimated the chairman. The
board had this always in its mind! This
raises the nice point of what value to
place on the oil assets, yet nobody said
anything about that. Later, perhaps.
Mr. Fairy’s other idea seemed much
milder, but Sir Colin turned it down
flat.
This also bore on the book value of
BHP’s assets, their value less deprecia-
tion. This was also claimed to be un-
realistic because accumulated deprecia-
tion provision of $4OO million included
a lot of money set aside from free
reserves. Mr. Fairy wanted the board
to show how much had been allowed by
the tax man over the years. The chair-
man’s objection to doing this seemed
rather silly in view of the pride taken
by a lot of overseas companies in the
big amounts they put aside from net
profits over and above the amounts
allowed for taxation assessments. Any-
way, it might be a good thing for all
companies who make such additional
provisions here to show the split in their
accumulated depreciation provisions so
as to impress on the Treasury the in-
adequacies of normal allowances.
The most intriguing soupcon in his
address proper was obviously the
guarded reference to raising more
capital during 1968 to finance the ex-
pansion of iron and steel production
and allied activities. It was not a ques-
tion of the cash flow easing, or, indeed,
of the current liquidity position being
unsatisfactory, but as the managing-
director, Sir lan McLennan, detailed
in his report, the company’s capital
commitments are heavy, quite apart
from what may be required on the oil
and gas sides which Sir Colin said
were being looked after satisfactorily
so far as the Marlin and Barracouta
developments were concerned but in
other directions could well require sub-
stantial additional finance to be ar-
ranged during the next two or three
years. Rather tongue-in-cheek, he ex-
plained that even these additional re-
quirements for oil and gas (including
some possible other minerals develop-
ments) would depend on how promis-
ing these other developments turned
out to be.
It probably wasn’t as much comfort
to BHP shareholders as the chairman
thinks not to be called on for new capi-
tal to develop the Marlin and Barra-
couta fields. There are precious few
other equity issues about these days
for them to put their “risk” capital into.
Under present arrangements, the privi-
lege of putting up this money is Esso’s.
As Sir Colin explained, for dry holes
Esso is meeting the cost and BHP
doesn’t have to pay a bean. In the case
of discovery and related step-out holes
in any of their joint fields the cost is
payable wholly by Esso and is not re-
coverable from BHP if BHP elects
to take a royalty rather than a half
interest. If BHP takes a half share then
half the total cost of discovery and
related step-out holes attributable to
BHP is recoverable by Esso out of
BHP’s share of subsequent production
revenue. In the case of Marlin and
Barracouta this is going to cost BHP
about $5 million.
BHP’s only running commitment
for expenditure, and therefore drain on
its cash flow, occurs when it elects to
take a half interest for further develop-
ment following a discovery well. The
strain of this shouldn’t currently be
very great because this principle doesn’t
apply in the case of Marlin, any well in
future discovered in the Otway basin
by the group is also to be exceptioned,
and Esso will meet the full cost up to
a stated figure (half of which will be
ultimately recoverable from BHP out
of production revenue if it elects to take
a half interest in any well discovered).
All in all, if the current strains on
BHP’s finances from its oil and gas
activities would seem to be light, they
should get progressively heavier and
this should, in time, assuage the enor-
mous appetite BHP shareholders have
for new issues, especially those at par.


AUSTRALIAN UNITED CORPORATION LIMITED
Address by the Chairman, Mr. C. T. Looker, to the Shareholders at the Annual
Meeting of the Company on Friday, Bth September, 1967.
Before dealing with the formal matters relating to
the Annual Accounts I should 1 like to refer to changes
in the Board of Directors since the last Annual Meet-
ing and also to the retirement of Sir lan Potter
following which your Directors elected me Chairman
of the AUC Group.
During the year Mr. N. S. Young retired from the
Board and Mr. L. Luxton, C.8.E., accepted an invita-
tion to join the Board. Recently Mr. W. K. Blair
and Mr. T. J. N. Foley, C.8.E., accepted invitations
to join the' Board. Shareholders will, I am sure, join
me in thanking Mr. Young for the very real contribu-
tion he made to the affairs of the Group during his
period of service as a Director and in welcoming Mr.
Luxton, Mr Blair and Mr. Foley whose wide experience
will prove of undoubted advantage to the Group.
Shortly after the close of the financial year Sir
lan Potter retired! from the Board. It is nearly 10
years since AUC became a public company and during
the whole of that time Sir lan, as Chairman, gave
to the Group outstanding leadership. That this is so
is evidenced by' the fact that our consolidated share-
holders’ funds, which at the close of our first year as
a public company stood at approximately $1,500,000,
now stand at approximately $12,250,000 and our total
consolidated assets which were then approximately
$5,000,000 are now in excess of $126,000,000. I should
like to take this opportunity to express my sincere
appreciation of the service rendered by my predecessor,
Sir lan Potter. The present sound condition of the
Group is due in great part to the energy and wise
counsel he brought to its affairs. A very solid founda-
tion has been laid for future progress.
My colleagues and I have, in our Report accompany-
ing the Annual Accounts, recorded our appreciation of
Sir lan’s leadership and I am sure that shareholders
will, later in this Meeting, want to record their thanks
ito him land to wish him well in the future.
It is with pleasure now that I submit to you a
motion for the adoption of the Tenth Annual Balance
Sheet and supporting Accounts of Australian United
Corporation limited together with the Report of the
Directors and the Auditors.
The Consolidated Net Profit of Australian United
Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries for the year
ended 30th June. 1967 is $1,237,444 compared with
$900,125 for the previous year. Of this profit $1,189,936
remains to Australian United Corporation Limited
after deducting the interest of outside shareholders in
the profits of subsidiary companies not wholly owned
by AUC. Last year the comparable amount was $873,907.
The Consolidated net profit has been struck after
providing for taxation on a basis (consistent with that
applied last year) which reflects allowance for accumu-
lated losses which arose in earlier years from the
liquidation of the trading assets of Australian United
Finance Limited (formerly Sargood Gardiner Limited)
and for the method which is currently adopted by the
authorities in levying taxation on companies the income
of which is principally derived from dividends and
interest.
An interim dividend of 5% on the ordinary and
S reference capital was paid on 17th March, 1967, and
re fixed dividend of 5% on the preference capital was
paid on 27th June, 1967. A final dividend of 5% on
the ordinary and preference capital has been declared
payable on’ Bth September, 1967. This total dividend
requirement absorbs $345,352 of the year’s profit
leaving an amount of $844,584 to be added to the
unappropriated profits of the Group from the year’s
operations.
From the unappropriated profits of the Group
$990,868 has been transferred to reserves—s929,B6B to
General Reserves increasing that item to $2,000,000
and $61,000 to Reserve for Contingencies increasing
that item to $1,000,060. After payment of the year’s
dividends and the transfers to reserves referred to
above, the balance of unappropriated profits at 30th
June, 1967 is $2,184,286.
I shall now refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
There was no change in the paid up capital of
AUC during the year. I have already referred to the
increase in General Reserves to $2,000,000 and to the
increase in Reserve for Contingencies to $1,000,000 and
to the addition of $844,584 to unappropriated profits
from the year’s operations. The net result of these
movements is a substantial increase in shareholders
funds from $11,356,114 to $12,240,597.
Current liabilities have risen by $35,671,782 which
reflects ian increase in Deposits of $36,351,161 offset
by a reduction of $690,108 in Sundry Creditors and
Clients Balances and minor movements in other current
liabilities.
Investments in quoted securities decreased by
$2,402,766 and the market value of the Group holdings
at the year end exceeded book value (after deducting
$700,000 Investment Fluctuation Reserve) by $660,454.
Investments in semi-government securities decreased by
$1,043,100 ;and investments in securities which are not
quoted increased by $346,257.
Advances rose by $3,308,050 which reflects in part a
re-deployment of cash arising from the reduction in
quoted securities referred to above and, in part, the
increase in Deposits already referred to.
Commonwealth Government Securities rose by
$33,854,245 and Commercial Bills by $749,621. Both these
increases reflect the substantial rise in Deposits, to
which I have referred, and which result from a sig-
nificant expansion during the year of the activities
of our subsidiary, United Discount Company of Aus-
tralia Limited in the official short-term money market.
Sundry Debtors are up by $1,784,538 resulting from
sales of securities, settlement for which has been
effected since the close of the financial year.
There have been minor movements only in fixed
assets and other assets which do not call for particular
comment.
Shareholders will, I think, be pleased to note that
the Consolidated Balance Sheet discloses that the Group
is in sound condition.
The operations and activities of the AUC Group are
diverse but they can be broadly classified under the
headings of underwriting and placing of corporate
securities, dealing the official short-term money
market, dealing in short-term money outside the official
market, dealing in securities, long-term investment
and investment portfolio management. I shall now
comment briefly on our activities under these headings
during the year under review.
We were actively engaged throughout the year in
the underwriting and placing of industrial, commer-
cial and semi-governmental issues. The volume of
business handled was higher than last year and a
significant improvement in profit was achieved.
In the official short term money market we had a
very satisfactory year and I am pleased to be able
to report a substantial increase in profits. We expanded
our business to meet the growth of the .market which
occurred during the year and at the close our portfolio
of short-term bonds and commercial bills was
approaching the $100,000,000 mark. Short-term bond
yields were steady throughout the first half of the
year and following the drop in the short-term bond
rate in February, 1967 yields have remained fairly
stable at the lower level. This is a highly competitive
market and margins are narrow profitability depending
upon portfolio management and maintenance of volume.


Since the close of the financial year the 180 day
Treasury Bill has been introduced. We welcome this
new security as further evidence that the authorities
wish to see 'the market continue to develop its flexibility
and thus its ability to fulfil its important role at the
short end of the financial system. We would like to
see two further steps taken. We feel sure there is
scope for a further increase in the permitted level of
commercial bills which dealers may hold in their port-
folios and we believe that the market would be tech-
nically stronger and more flexible if discounted
Treasury Bills were made available to it by re-issue
At present, while the Reserve Bank is able from time
to time to make available Government obligations held
by it in its portfolio, it is unable to re-issue Treasury
Notes of 90 and 180 days which it has purchased and
Which still have some days or weeks to run to maturity.
If these could be re-issued by the Bank much
greater flexibility would foe achieved in this market
so dependent on fine margins.
We found increasing business available in short-
term lending to sound industrial and commercial con-
cerns and in discounting commercial bills. The level
of our advances rose by approximately one-third and
our profits from these activities were considerably
higher than last year.
Significant adjustments were made to our portfolio
of listed securities during the year. Dividend income
was on a lower level than last year as was the surplus
arising from portfolio movements but the overall result
was satisfactory. It is intended, with this more active
market, to take greater advantage of the expertise
built up by the staff of your Company by being more
active in marketable securities.
Adjustments were also made to our portfolio of un-
listed securities and at the year end the level of these
investments was somewhat higher than last year. In
the main they represent long-term holdings and though
several have net yet reached the point of contributing
to Group profits, the portfolio as a whole produced
useful income.
The specialised services of AUC in the field of port-
folio management and advice continued to develop
during the year and though we do not look to signifi-
cant profit from this activity, we regard it as a very
important service to our clients.
Looking over the activities of the Group as a whole,
the 1966/1967 year has fulfilled the expectation my
predecessor. Sir lan Potter, held when he addressed
you at this time last year—continuing high level of
activity at a satisfactory level of profitability. Viewed
from today the outlook for 1967/1968 is broadly similar.
The Budget, recently introduced, is designed to main-
tain the activity stimulated by the 1966 Budget. It
could even be that during the current financial year,
mild restraints may be necessary. We expect to be
busy throughout the year and we look forward to a
satisfactory profit.
We must look beyond the confines of our own busi-
ness for organisations such as AUC depend for their
growth iand prosperity upon the growth and prosperity
of the economy of the country. In doing so, I see an
interesting year ahead.
Government policy in recent years has aimed at
balancing the components of demand- sometimes to
the detriment of economic growth and it is refreshing
to note from the Treasurer’s Budget Speech that,
within the limits available, the private sector is to
take precedence during the current financial year.
During the remainder of the first half there should
therefore be a continuation in the moderate rate of
growth in real terms experienced so far followed by
a gain in momentum during the second' half when
it can fairly be anticipated that lagging investment
expenditure will respond to an established recovery
in business activity. Seen today, the indicators point
to a busier year than last year with, at the end, a
useful advance in real terms having been achieved.
Given reasonable stability in the level of prices,
which should be attainable as a result of the Govern-
ment’s avowed intention to remain flexible in its
policy and the containment of the level of imports
within manageable proportions vis a vis the level
of exports, long-term interest rates are unlikely to
rise during the current year. Nor are they likely to
fall. The short-term rate structure is perhaps more
vulnerable, for the Treasurer has indicated in his
Budget Speech that the authorities will not hesitate
to bring restrictive monetary measures into play should
signs of overheating appear in the economy—a situa-
tion which just might develop during the second half
of the year.
Over recent years it has been extremely difficult to
predict movements in our balance of payments and
the likely level of our foreign exchange reserves. This
year is no exception and one is forced to speculate
whether the elements of fortuitousness and resilience
which have come to cur aid in recent years will be
needed again this year. An adverse trading position
could cause a substantial depletion in our reserves
if the impact of the U.S. and U.K. capital restrictions
is as severe as some anticipate. Increasing sales of
iron ore (resulting from the Government’s more relaxed
approach to long-term contracts) of coal, of bauxite
and alumina, of beach sands and other minerals may
foe expected to strengthen the export position in 1967/68.
Manufactured goods rose from 15% to 17% of total
exports during 1966/1967 and this trend should con-
tinue. Rural exports are more susceptible to seasonal
and pricing factors and may be affected by lower
prices for some commodities. There is still concern
in regard to seasonal prospects in Western Victoria
and South and Central New South Wales. But the
key to the final outcome of the balance of trade appears
to he the extent to which the level of imnorts could
rise should excessive demand tendencies develop in
the economy later in the year. There seems to me
little doubt that the authorities will foe quick to act
with monetary measures in those circumstances before
significant damage is done to our foreign exchange
reserves. It is, of course, not possible to be precise
but. taking a view today, I doubt whether in the
event we shall end the year very materially worse
off in foreign exchange than we are today.
In referring to the outlook for our balance of pay-
ments I have mentioned the restrictions which the
U.S. and U.K. authorities have applied to the export
of capital by their nationals. These restrictions have
been in force for some time and it can foe said that
they have not yet resulted in serious damage to the
Australian balance of payments. This perhaps is due
more to the fact that the flow of capital to Australia
from the U.S. and the U.K. during 1966 and 1967 has
been in respect of projects which were in the pipeline
before the restrictions became fully effective than to
wishful thinking that the restrictions are ineffective.
The fact that more overseas capital reached Australia
last year ($530 million) than in 1964/65 (S4BO million)
should not be overlooked but at the same time too
much reliance should not be placed on the comparison
for when restrictions are put into force it often takes
time before you really feel the bite.
The Australian authorities, quite rightly, were very
much alive to the problems which these restrictions
posed not only for cur balance of payments but also
for our internal capital market. It is natural that
the Australian subsidiaries of large international con-
cerns, which in normal times depend largely on the
flow of funds from their parent organisations to finance
growth, should turn to the local market when the
parent tap is turned off. The possible effect of the
restrictions on the capital market had become evident
by May, 1965, when the Treasurer issued a statement
requesting overseas controlled companies to consult
the Reserve Bank before setting out to raise money
on the Australian market. Since then an arbitrary
and somewhat vague capital issues control has been
exercised by the Treasury, through the Reserve Bank,
over those Australian companies controlled abroad
which have consulted the Reserve Bank. Apart from
the very generalised statement made by the Treasurer
in May 1965 no clear guide lines have been issued
and a thoroughly unsatisfactory situation has
developed.
It is perhaps too much to expect definitions and
rules in these days of voluntary restraints, guide lines,
etc., but something a good deal more positive is
required today than reference to a generalised state-
ment couched in esoteric terms issued over two years
ago. This is particularly so today when a number of
large companies which have formed part of the indus-
trial or commercial scene in Australia for many years
and in which the Australian public hold substantial
equity interests must be in doubt about their ability
to meet their legitimate future capital requirements
simply because it can foe held that the major part
of their capital is owned abroad.
Your Directors wish again to record their apprecia-
tion of the work done by the management and staff
during the year.

Behind the balance sheets
A coming recovery in Prestige
ON THE FACE of it, Prestige Ltd.
has been slipping. Earning rate on capi-
tal has fallen in each of the past four
years (from 34.1 percent to 24.3 per-
cent) and so has the proportion of pre-
tax profits to sales (from 9.1 percent
to 6.3 percent). But the latest accounts,
for 1966-67, show that the company
seems not only to have stopped the
slide but to have begun a solid recovery
movement.
For not only was the 1966-67 earn-
ing rate only fractionally down by 0.1
percent as higher capital offset a 12
percent profit rise, but earnings on total
funds employed in the business showed
a healthy rise from 5.8 percent to 6.4
percent. And these basic improvements
took place in a year that was not nearly
as good as the current year promises
to be; in the first half of 1966-67, the
company had suffered from “signifi-
cantly reduced profits” because of dif-
ficult trading conditions. So all the full
year’s profit rise was earned in the
past six months. “Valuable increases in
sales and profits” have been registered
in the opening quarter of the current
year and, moreover, profit margins are
in line with the improvement shown in
the June half of 1967. This year, there-
fore, promises a recovery in the profit
to sales ratio; a lift only to seven per-
cent would have added another mil-
lion to last year’s profits.
It is also significant that last year’s
profit rise was despite a reduction in
selling prices over a considerable area
of production, so a substantial volume
increase was necessary to produce the
11.6 percent value increase in turnover,
which, incidentally, corresponded with
the after-tax profit increase. This year
there is every prospect that the com-
pany’s profit will easily exceed the pre-
vious record in 1964 of $1.14 million
and that earning rate will move well
above the 25 percent mark to provide
the company, when added to the large
depreciation provision, with a healthy
cash flow after paying the 12J percent
dividend.
Last year was the first time the 1965-
66 acquisitions of the Heathermoor and
Brandella knitting groups in Australia
and Victoria Knitwear in New Zealand
contributed fully to results. On a strictly
comparable group basis, sales rose 5.2
percent. Prestige (N.Z.) Ltd. and Vic-
toria Knitwear earned 11.5 percent less
in the year under review, due to diffi-
cult economic conditions and import
restrictions in New Zealand, and there
is no early improvement to be expected
here.
Accumulated profits were not helped
much this last year by capital profits
on the sale of assets, which was a
source of $330,000 the year before.
However, net tangible asset backing
moved up from $l.ll to $l.lB per 50c
share. Over the past five years, but
particularly in the past two, tax pro-
vided has been higher than standard
rates, probably because of the contri-
bution to profit made by its New
Zealand subsidiaries which face higher
tax charges.
This highly diversified textile organ-
isation in Australia and New Zealand
derives 19 percent of revenue from
fabrics, 21 percent from hosiery, 18
percent from socks and footwear, 11
percent from knitted outerwear and
schoolwear, 17 percent from lingerie,
shirts and underwear, and 14 percent
from yarns. Its spread of production
gives a wide base with which to absorb
adverse effects of fashion and other
disturbances in the textile and apparel
industries.
Prestige has spent over ssm. in the
past four years on plant and equip-
ment, of which sl.2m. was in 1966-67
year to March. Management recognises
the desirability of keeping abreast of
rapidly changing fashions and textile
technology by a continuing process of
plant replacement, and now aims to at
least cover the major portion of its
large annual expenditure on new plant
by its annual provision for depreciation.
Stocks seem to have been well con-
trolled, with only a 4 percent rise to
$8.6m., resulting in an improvement in
stock turn. Management did not have
the same degree of success with debtors,
which rose 13 percent faster than the
sales increase.
Directors said the repayment of
secured loans was mainly responsible
for the extension of bank overdraft
from $533,000 to $1,341,000. In
1966-67 $492,624 in loans were repaid,
and on July 1, 1967, $677,784 in notes
were redeemed, chopping $40,000-odd
off the company’s fixed interest bill.
This year’s cash flow of about $2 mil-
lion after paying dividends will help
ease what still looks like a fairly tight
liquidity situation; the needs of plant
replacement and the only moderate
current assets ratio of 1.6 to 1 may
limit the company’s dividend ambitions
for a few more years.
In the past decade shareholders have
been treated to two bonuses, in 1960
and 1963. The acquisition of Holeproof
(the tail that now quite clearly wags
the dog) late in 1963 for s7m. cash
required the issue of ordinary shares
to shareholders in the ratio of three-
for-five at 40c premium in January,
1964, and a private placement of slm.
in preference shares. (This brought
preference capital to almost s2m.
against current issued ordinary capital
of $3.9m.) In September, 1965, there
was another premium issue (one-for-
five at 30c premium) and further issues
seem likely to feed Prestige’s growing
need for working capital and a steady
appetite for capital for the latest in
textile machinery.
The Bulletin predicted in its issue of
August 13, 1966, that Prestige Lid.
shares at 78c were near the bottom
of the cycle. And so it proved to be,
for the low for the past two years was
75c. As forecast here, the shares have
forged ahead and now are selling for
92c, where they offer a yield of 6.8 per-
cent on income and 13.2 percent on
earnings.
But pricing Prestige shares at only
7.3 times last year’s earnings means
that the market thinks less highly of
Prestige now than it did in 1964, when
this ratio was up at 7.8 percent. In
view of its prospects, a ratio of at least
eight and possibly up to ten times
seems more reasonable. This would
suggest a price of between $1 and $1.25
a share, and that could be a likely
price range in the current year. The
75-cents days are well and truly over.

Security analysis
APM’s earnings per share
should soon increase
THE FULL NAME of Australian
Paper Manufacturers Limited could
well be forgotten because the initials
“APM” are so much better known to
all people, including investors. It is a
much larger operation than Australian
Newsprint. Ordinary capital is three
times as great and ordinary share-
holders’ funds more than four times as
great. Furthermore, it is quite a differ-
ent operation.
Australian Newsprint received no
tariff protection because its customers
(and its major shareholders in most
cases) had agreed to purchase Aus-
tralian Newsprint’s produce at the same
price as Canadian newsprint, landed in
Sydney. As a result of News Ltd. and
Australian Consolidated Press becom-
ing shareholders, I think it is fair to
say that all the major customers of Aus-
tralian Newsprint are now shareholders
and, of course, the agreed price for
newsprint for the next ten years is
above the current Canadian landed
price.
APM does not serve major share-
holders only, and it is probably true
to say that very few of APM’s cus-
tomers are also substantial shareholders
if any. APM supplies a large number
of paper converters throughout Aus-
tralia under the umbrella of quite high
tariff protection. Yet, strangely enough,
the 1967 annual report shows that the
company also exported its products
to 12 countries in East Africa, Asia,
and the Pacific.
We noted that there had been a
strong downward trend in the price
that Australian Newsprint was obtain-
ing for its product; it can also be seen
from the graph that APM produces in
its annual report that prices have been
at best steady over the same period,
although there has been a slight rising
trend in the past three years. It seems
that this trend will continue, for small
increases are still being made in the
prices of certain APM products.
No similar graph of expenses per ton
is produced in the annual report, so it
is necessary to make some arbitrary
calculation. For this purpose, the costs
of the parent company are taken as
those shown in the statements of profit
under the heading “Materials, wages,
services, and sundry expenses,” and the
costs per ton derived by dividing this
figure by the number of tons sold. As a
check, the same calculation was made
in respect of the parent company’s
figure for “Net sales.” The results are
as follows:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
Sales value per ton $ 208 210 208 210 211 213
Expenses per ton $ 157 167 165 168 175 178
Gross margin
per ton $ 51 43 43 42 36 35
These figures suggest a shrinking
margin out of which must be met the
interest charge and depreciation before
arriving at the pre-tax profit per ton.
At this stage it is as well to examine
the usual statistics to see the pattern
which they disclose:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967

Although the dividends received
from subsidiaries do not necessarily bear
any relationship to the profit earned in
the year of payment, it may be of
interest to examine the other “Income”
which the parent company has received
over the past five years:
Year to June 30 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
s’ooo
Interest 139 218 398 386 575
Subsidiary companies 649 936 1131 1642' 1815
Listed public
companies 3 1 40
Other companies 110 504 785
Total 788 1154 1642 2533 3215
It must be pointed out that the total
income of the parent company always
exceeded the total consolidated income
over this period and it is reasonable
assumption that dividends from sub-
sidiaries exceeded the apparent profit.
The dividends from other companies
have become quite a substantial item
in the past two years. It is somewhat
strange to find that the figure has been
very much higher in the consolidated
accounts than in the parent company’s
accounts in the past two years. The
explanation is that APM Forests Pty.
Ltd. receives dividends from Pyneboard
(Gippsland) Pty. Ltd. amounting to
about $278,000 in 1965/66 and to
$157,000 in 1966/67.
The growing income from subsidiary
and associated companies is of some
consequence, but the main income still
comes from the production of paper
and board for the packaging industry.
During 1966/67 nearly 436,000 tons of
paper and board were produced and the
various mills were working at near full
capacity. The exception was in May,
when operating time of some machines,
normally 24 hours a day, seven days
a, week, was reduced by 28J percent!
Some reduction would presumably have
been necessary to allow for mainten-
ance. APM has two major extensions of
productive capacity under way in the
No. 6 machine at Fairfield, Victoria,
and the No. 8 machine at Botany,
New South Wales.
APM can then increase its capacity
by about 40 percent in the next two
years, and can then increase it again
by about 28 percent. Assuming that
“easy extension” means that this could
occur within three years, APM is in
a position to cope with an increase in
demand of about 11|- percent per annum
compound in the next five years. It
is much more likely that APM is not
thinking in terms of such growth but
is probably making plans for adequate
capacity for the next ten years.
If we assume that the growth rate
in demand for APM’s products will
remain unchanged for the next five
years, and that there will be no worth-
while increase in the price of paper
and board, then sales value in 1972
could be of the order of $l2O million.
Clearly, the gross profit will depend
on the trend in costs and, although
there has been a noticeable upward
trend in costs per ton in the past few
years, it may not be unreasonable to
assume that the new and larger
machines will provide efficiency factors
which will just contain the increases
in wages particularly. This would mean
that the gross margin will be about
$2O million.
On the basis of past charges, it
seems likely that depreciation would
increase to about $lO million on the
completion of the two new machines.
It is now merely (!) a matter of
deciding whether the expenditure of
another $2l million will require the
raising of any new capital, whether
equity or loan capital, or even con-
vertible notes. It would seem from
the directors’ report for 1967 that the
company must have in mind further
capital raisings, otherwise it is hardly
necessary to push the convertible note
tax relief barrow. Let us then assume
that a further $lO million will be
raised in loan capital at an interest
rate of 1\ percent. This would raise
the total interest charge to $3 million
and would therefore leave about $7
million before tax.
Two matters remain, namely, the
tax rate in five years’ time, and the
investment income in five years’ time.
Tax has been held down by calls on
the capital of APM Forests and by
investment allowances. Investment in-
come has quadrupled since 1963. To
be conservative, it will be assumed that
full tax will be paid in 1972 and that
investment income will double. This
will mean that earnings per share will
rise to 15J cents per share.
Everything depends on APM being
able to maintain its existing share of
the Australian market (there is a small
cloud on the horizon in the form of
a large linerboard machine due to be
built in New Zealand), but if it does
then there seems every possibility that
the next five years will sbow some good
growth in per share earnings. Since the
shares are only selling at about ten
times the 1971/72 earnings estimate as
compared with the 13.4 times of Aus-
tralian Newsprint, APM’s shares seem
to be a little more favorably priced.
Regrettably, APM’s market does not
seem to be so assured as that of Aus-
tralian Newsprint.

Mining
Power into Mount Morgan
THE MANAGING DIRECTOR of
Power Corporation Australia Limited,
Mr. D. L. Elsworth, is surely to be
congratulated on his engineering of the
bid for 51 percent of Mount Morgan’s
capital. If successful, the bid will bring
his company an investment yielding
5.1 percent, which has active interests
in the development and mining of sev-
eral of Australia’s most exportable
minerals. For shareholders of Mount
Morgan, and these include the present
as well as the future shareholders, the
offer will almost certainly mean that
Mount Morgan’s activities as a devel-
oper of new mineral deposits will be
increased, and that the resources neces-
sary to do this will be forthcoming.
The joining of Charter Consolidated,
of London, and the Anglo-American
Corporation of South Africa to the bid
adds a neat twist in that it provides
those companies with an already-listed
enterprise which could become the
vehicle for the development of mining
projects arising from the exploration
programs in which they are currently
involved here.
The actual offer is $4.40 cash for
-51 percent of the ordinary shares, after
the payment of the final dividend of
12£ cents per share. The success of the
offer will mean that Mount Morgan
Limited will become the 51 percent-
owned subsidiary of Power Mining Pty.
Ltd. The shareholders of this company
are Power Corporation Australia
Limited (60 percent) and Charter Con-
solidated Ltd., with Anglo-American
Corporation of South Africa (40 per-
cent). The last two companies bring
the venture considerable prestige from
their technical experience and financial
expertise in mining operations. In Aus-
tralia these companies have been pros-
pecting for some time, covering many
areas in Western Australia (in the
Fraser Ranges as well as the Kalgoorlie
district), Queensland, and Tasmania
(in conjunction with EZ Industries)
and other companies in a search for
off-shore minerals,
It may be from these programs that
Mount Morgan’s next, investment could
well come. Further investments away
from the copper-gold mine at Mount
Morgan would be quite in keeping with
the company’s policy in recent years.
A few months ago it bought a 20 per-
cent interest in Consolidated Metal
Smelters Limited, the Sydney-based lead
products manufacturer, and in recent
years has developed a small but promis-
ing iron-ore venture at Mount Bundey,
in the Northern Territory, as well as
taking up a small interest in Nabalco
Pty. Ltd., the company sponsored by
Swiss Aluminium to develop bauxite
deposits at' Gove, in the Northern
Territory. It also has large coal re-
serves, which may have some export
potential, in the Dawson Valley. An-
other, but unsuccessful, investment was
Mount Morgan’s venture into ready-
mixed concrete.
The other shareholder of Power
Mining Limited is Power Corporation
Australia Limited. This is the local
subsidiary of Power Corporation of
Canada, a large investment house which
has invested here by way of a $3.6
million loan to Motels of Australia
Limited, the loan carrying options to
take up shares, and the purchase of a
$1 million pastoral property in New
South Wales. To assist in financing
the current offer, Power Corporation
Australia has increased its capital by
the issue of $1 million in shares to
two U.S. companies (Bankers Trust of
New York, and International Utilities
Corporation) as well as to a local com-
pany, the MLC Limited. Thiis, the
Canadian parent now holds 64 percent
of its capital, while its partners hold
12 percent each.
Power Corporation Australia’s capi-
tal is to become $8.4 million and each
of the four shareholders have lent the
company $1 million each. It is not
known how much of the company’s
total funds have been invested in
Power Mining Ltd; the bid for Mount
Morgan will require slightly less than
$9 million, of which Charter and An-
glo-American will be providing 40 per-
cent. This appears to leave Power
Corporation Australia with funds of
more than $7 million if its shares are
fully paid up. The company is at pre-
sent investigating a large property in
the Northern Territory with a view to
purchase, but this would still leave
quite a lot of money in kitty. Will the
group’s investment be over or under
ground level?
The bid certainly makes an interest-
ing beginning to what could well be a
new chapter in the continuing history
of the Mount Morgan mine. It is one
of Australia’s oldest operating mines,
having started operations in 1886,
originally as a gold mine but finding
copper a necessary mineral when the
ore became less rich in gold. Falling
copper prices at the end of World War
I hit the company badly and later (in
1925) the mine, which was then an
underground operation, was guttered by
fire and had to be flooded. A° a result
of this fire and general economic: condi-
tions, the company went into liquida-
tion in 1927.
The next part of the mine’s story
began in 1929 when the former general
manager was able to float Mount Mor-

gan Limited after convincing investors
that it would be profitable to operate
an open-cut mine. After some difficult
years to begin with, the venture be-
came more profitable when copper
prices started to rise in 1932. The
smelter was installed in 1938. After the
war, operations reflected the rises and
falls in copper prices and profits during
the ’fifties were the highest in the com-
pany’s existence, until the record pro-
fit earned last year of $2,918,946.
As a mine, Mount Morgan itself has
several features which stand it in good
stead for the future. In recent years
it has charged against profits the
removal of large quantities of over-
burden in advance of actual mining
requirements; consequently, in the years
ahead the ratio of overburden to actual
■ore can be expected to remain close to
the 2:1 ratio experienced last year
rather than the higher ratios of recent
years. Another feature of the company’s
operations is that it regularly extracts
a substantial quantity of ore from out-
side the calculated ore reserves. This
has the effect of increasing the life of
the mine well beyond that indicated by
the ore reserve figures.
In addition to these assets, the com-
pany has, as a result of its activities
over the years, accumulated vast quan-
tities of sulphur-bearing ore in its waste
dumps. The Mount Morgan ore con-
tains 15 percent sulphur, and the'com-
pany has plant capable of producing
pyrites containing 51 percent sulphur.
Several times in recent years the com-
pany has attempted to put these reserves
of pyrites to commercial use, and at one
stage the American chemical concern,
W. R. Grace & Co., joined with Mount
Morgan in a plan to use the pyrites in
a fertiliser plant to be established at
Gladstone. While world supplies of
elemental sulphur continue to diminish
and prices keep rising, there will come
a time when these pyrites are a valuable
asset. Thus, its purchase of 51 percent
of Mount Morgan’s capital should, for
these reasons alone, be an excellent
investment for Power Corporation Aus-
tralia, especially as it is likely to be-
come a large consumer of fertiliser in
its role as a pastoralist.

The forward look
Australia is a nation on the move
with vast new industrial and
mining projects under way
many new land development
schemes in progress new
transport services being planned.
Large scale construction projects
at Shell’s two refineries at
Geelong, Victoria, and Clyde,
New South Wales, keep pace
with progress. They are evidence
of Shell’s “Forward Look” and its
ability to meet an ever-increasing
demand for high quality
petroleum products.

The bright world of nickel
WESTERN MINING Corporation has
luckily come into the active production
of nickel at a most fruitful stage of the
metal’s development. Speaking at Kam-
balda’s official opening last Friday,
WMC’s chairman, Mr. Lindesay Clark,
was not over-optimistic in saying that
the company did not expect to meet
any difficulties on the market side.
Some particularly striking confirma-
tion of Mr. Clark’s attitude was fur-
nished, also last week, by the vice-
president of Canada’s Falconbridge
Nickel Mines Ltd., Mr. W. G. Dahl.
When he addressed the American Min-
ing Congress he could only begin by
stating that the long-term possibilities
for nickel wem bright.
At the moment, demand is ahead
of immediately available supply. As
Mr. Clark noticed, this position has
“rather upset” those buyers used to
International Nickel, the world’s big-
gest producer, almost automatically
keeping supply and demand in balance.
Nickel can perhaps be classed as the
fastest-growing metal in general use.
During 1966, Free World usage
totalled 680 million pounds, of which
the United States absorbed 330 million
pounds. World consumption is pre-
dicted to double over the next 11 years.
By 1970 consumption should reach 880
million pounds a year and by 1975
1200 million pounds. Falconbridge
estimates the long-term growth rate at
6| percent compound a year.
To keep up with these trends in the
near future, Free World mine capacity
is expected to attain an output of 1030
million pounds by 1970 and 1475 mil-
lion pounds by 1975. In 1975 Canadian
mines should produce 800 million
pounds of contained nickel, New Cale-
donian 290 million, and the United
States 47 million.
There is quite a roll-call of smaller
producers to make up the remaining
338 million pounds of suggested 1975
capacity. They include Australia, the
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, South
Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Rhodesia, and Venezuela.
Nickel’s remarkable recent growth
has mainly proceeded from a greatly
heightened demand in the making of
stainless steel, high-nickel alloys and
nickel plating. Shortages of copper, too,
have given rise to a substitution demand.
In the view of this considerable usage
by the steel industry, one part of Mr.
Dahl’s talk is of special interest. He
referred to increasing acceptance by
steelmakers of the use of ferronickel and
oxide. “The source form of nickel for
industrial use has undergone rapid
change during the post-World War II
period,” Mr. Dahl observed. “Prior to
1945 almost all nickel was used as
refined metal. Gradually, various grades
of nickel oxide and ferronickel have
gained acceptance, especially in steel-
making, which is the largest single-user
industry. In 1966, 32 percent of Free
World nickel was supplied as ferro-
nickel or oxide.”
This trend in usage is focusing more
attention on lateritic nickel deposits, as
distinct from the sulphide ores such as
Western Mining has discovered. Later-
itics need less time than sulphide de-
posits to be brought into production.
Whatever the type of nickel ore most
in production, Western Mining’s
apparent decision to move toward con-
struction of a smelter and ultimately
a refinery brings it into the world nickel
picture at a very suitable time. WMC’s
reserves position has been improving
all along and Mr. Clark’s opinion is
clear. “The question at this stage is
not whether the Kambalda operation
should be expanded, but at what rate
the expansion should take place and in
what form the products should be
marketed.”

There couldn’t have been the slightest doubt about the
Halibut oil frenzy, and the end result of it all was that BHP
added a net $1.05 to close at $13.45; during Friday’s trading
a peak $13.80 was achieved and volumes were naturally very
heavy. A clear second favorite over the week was Western
Mining, which put on $1.70 and finished at $22.20. Two other
eminences turned out to be Mount Morgan, up 90 cents to
$4.40, and the still advancing Peko-Wallsend, up 34 cents to
$4.98. Among the quieter industrials, G. E. Crane slipped 30
cents, while Union Carbide gained 30 cents.

Hemorrhoids
It strikes 7 out of every 10 people in
all walks of life. Yet many otherwise
intelligent people know little of its dan-
gers. Piles (hemorrhoids) are aggra-
vated by many factors—including
over-exertion and unsuitable diet.
Neglect—and reliance on superficial
relief —invites serious medical conse-
quences. Eight years’ Swiss research
developed Varemoid Tablets—now
regarded by overseas specialists as the
leading anti-inflammatory treatment
for piles. Remarkable improvement is
being achieved —even with sufferers
of over 20 years. A week’s course
will convince you.
Ask your family chemist for Varemoid.

THE LAND
Another American holding
in the Territory
THE AMERICANS are still on the
prowl in the pastoral north and the
latest to settle for a holding is the
Dillingham Corporation of Australia
Pty. Ltd., local subsidiary of the huge
Dillingham construction group. Last
week’s move is happily a diversification
on the way to eventual public listing,
so Australians won’t eventually be left
out in the investment cold.
Dillingham has bought two leases
(with 43 years to run) over 1094
square miles of marginal cattle country
in the Northern Territory. They com-
prise Waterhouse Station and the adja-
cent Mountain Valley Station. Both will
now be worked together as Mountain
Valley.
The company sounds quite candid
in its judgment of the quality of the
land it plans to operate. “The area is
not the best cattle country at present
but it has potential for development,”
the managing director, Mr. Ben Dilling-
ham, explains. Yet his ambition is to
lift stock capacity from about 500 Q
head of cattle to some 40,000 during a
period of 11 years. Mountain Valley
possesses high summer rainfall but
lacks adequate feed for the dry season.
The panacea to produce the apparent
miracle, and to furnish sufficient feed,
is to be Townsville lucerne (Stylo-
santhes humilis) . The properties hope
to grow 60,000 acres of it, allowing the
cattle to hold their wet-season condi-
tion. Indeed the whole improvement
program should lead to carcass weights
of 5001 b. in two years instead of five.
The lucerne needs heavy application of
superphosphate. Such soil improvement
could, however, permit sorghum and
other crops “as a sideline.”
The effort will be worth careful
watching. These Territory areas now
carry only about 3 beasts to the square
mile. Townsville lucerne can certainly
be established, as previous experiments
have indicated. Native species, though,
are apt to smother it unless they are
heavily grazed or cleared at sowing.
E. S. Hoffman, writing in the collec-
tion “Agriculture in the Australian
Economy,” believes the “problem may
be one of managing flexible stocking
rates rather than any difficulty in intro-
ducing tropical legume species.”
The all-round efficacy of Townsville
lucerne plus superphosphate has cer-
tainly been well demonstrated for
Queensland’s spear grass country by a
long series of CSIRO investigations at
Rodd’s Bay (near Gladstone) and at
Townsville. Beef production may be
increased four to tenfold as a conse-
quence of higher carrying capacities,
better weight gains, and better calving
percentages.
Dr. J. Griffiths Davies has given an
impressive summary of achievements at
Rodd’s Bay: “Unimproved spear grass
pastures grazed at one beast to nine
acres produce a liveweight gain of 251 b.
per acre per year. This is increased to
one beast to 2 acres in good seasons and
one beast to four acres in a severe
drought with liveweight gains per acre
per year of from 100 to 2401 b. This
improvement is brought about by over-
sowing the native pasture with Towns-
ville lucerne and a yearly top dressing
with lcwt. per acre of molybdenised
superphosphate.”
The Townsville Pastoral Research
Laboratory discovered that the calving
Dillingham’s Territory holdings
percentage was raised from 47 percent
without superphosphate to 78 percent
with lcwt. and to 100 percent with
3cwt. of superphosphate per acre.
The economics of the Rodd’s Bay
treatment is striking: “For the price of
$1.50 per acre Townsville lucerne can
be established in native pasture and for
another $2.30 a year lcwt. of super-
phosphate can be applied. The gross
return of one acre of unimproved native
pasture was estimated at Rodd’s Bay a
few years ago to be $2.00 a year, and
for a pasture with Townsville lucerne
and lcwt. of superphosphate annually
this was $15.00.”
The adaptation of Townsville
lucerne at Dillingham’s Mountain Val-
ley is plainly crucial to its development.

New findings from
the CSIRO
THE NINETEENTH ANNUAL
REPORT (1966-67) of the CSIRO
mentions several exhilarating prospects
for the man on the land. Some findings
of immediate practical value are also
outlined.
Perhaps the most exciting possibility
is that a practical means may soon be
found which will enable sheep to grow
twice, or even up to four times, as much
wool. The underlying discovery is that
when certain proteins are introduced
directly into the fourth stomach, the
abomasum, of sheep, the rate of wool
growth increases dramatically. Two
ounces of the milk protein, casein, were
put each day into this part of the gut
through an artificial orifice surgically
constructed in each sheep of a small
experimental batch. Except for the addi-
tional casein the sheep were fed drought
rations, but their wool production
jumped from 51b. per head per year to
as much as 201 b.
In ruminants, bacteria in the first
three stomachs get first use of whatever
protein there is in the food swallowed
by the animal. The Division of Animal
Physiology, which first demonstrated
the extraordinary effect of pure protein
put into the hind gut, is now trying
to devise a practical way of getting
protein past the bacteria unharmed.
The hint is that success is not far beyond
its scientists’ grasp, because applications
for patents have been submitted already.
The principle has even been refined
further. It is not even necessary to get
protein into the abomasum. Certain
components of protein, the sulphur-con-
taining amino-acids, will work just as
well if released in the fourth stomach.
This finding adds another string to the
scientists’ bow, so to speak. The amino-
acids can be coated with protectively
treated protein to ensure that some
active ingredient gets through unscathed
to the abomasum. Details of feeding
such a potent, but relatively cheap,
supplement to millions of sheep are
not discussed in the Report. Presum-
ably, this aspect does not pose insur-
mountable difficulties. Cattle produc-
tion, which will also undoubtedly be
influenced by this research if it can be
brought to a successful conclusion, may
be the first to benefit. The feeding of
concentrates to dairy cattle, for
instance, is a customary procedure.
AND MENTIONING DAIRYING, the
Report also has something stimulating
to offer a possible means of short-
circuiting the lengthy process of progeny
testing. The Division of Animal
Genetics, pursuing a kind of Eve being
formed from Adam’s rib theory, believes
that mammary tissue is basically skin
tissue. If this is so, certain features of
a bull’s skin should give some indica-

tion of how much mammary tissue his
daughters will develop. Microscopic
examination of the hair follicles and
sweat glands in samples of skin from
two-year-old bulls has provided good
predictions of their daughters’ per-
formance. The Division has now
solicited the aid of two State Depart-
ments of Agriculture so that the tech-
nique can be widely tested with different
breeds. Under the present system of
progeny testing it takes five or six
years to evaluate a bull. By cutting
this period to two years, perhaps less
eventually, it should be possible to
speed up the rate of improvement in
dairy herds remarkably.
MOST OF AUSTRALIA is too hot
for pleasant living, and although farm
work has necessarily to be done out-of-
doors, northern development would
probably proceed more rapidly if
people knew that they could retreat
to comfortable homes after the day’s
hard toil was done. Though enjoying
a relatively benign climate itself, the
Division of Mechanical Engineering has
been looking to see whether something
can be done about this.
The only existing effective air-
Vonditioning system for the tropics
utilises the principle of refrigeration.
This makes it far too costly for most
people’s budgets. The Division has seen
an opportunity of cutting running costs
many fold by employing a system
known as Rock Bed Regenerative Cool-
ing. This method simply uses an evapor-
ative cooler to lower the temperature
of a large pile of crushed stones near
the building to be cooled. Then fresh,
drier air is drawn through the pile and
is cooled before passing on into the
house. A test house in Melbourne per-
formed most creditably during a heat
wave last summer. When the outside
shade temperature was 105 degrees, the
air temperature inside the house was 80
degrees F. Power consumption was 600
watts; i.e., about one-fifth of what
would have been consumed by a refrig-
erated cooling system capable of doing
an equally effective job. The RBR
system has been installed in homes in
Townsville, Brisbane, Griffith (N.S.W.),
and Northam (W.A.) for further test-
ing under more rigorous conditions.
THE REPORT also intimates that the
temperature of the sea surface may
control the occurrence of drought. Good
records of sea-surface temperatures are
available only for Port Hacking, near
Sydney, but they show that wet spells
are experienced in northern New South
Wales and southern Queensland when
the sea temperatures are higher than
average and vice-versa. At any rate, it
seems likely that, if weather forecasters
could use sea-surface temperatures as
well as their usual data, better, and
perhaps longer-range, predictions could
be made.

BOOKS
Grass’ play about another kind
of tin drummer
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising.
Guenter Grass. Seeker. $3.15.
THE 17th JUNE IS still the hottest
dqte in the Berlin political calendar
for both East and West. Singularly
colorless as dates go, it lacks the catchi-
ness of “remember the sth of Novem-
ber,” the sinister undertones of the Ides
of March, or the village-green Labor
associations of the Ist of May; but
it has, since 1953, been declared a new
public holiday in West Germany and
become a day of heightened tension for
those living in the East.
It all goes back to the 17th June,
1953, when the workers of Communist
East Berlin revolted against their rulers
spontaneously, untidily, and pathetic-
ally. The immediate causes were: too
little to eat, too-long queues to get what
there was; and the final straw, the com-
pulsory raising of the working “norm”
by ten percent.
Guenter Grass knew exactly what he
was about when he chose to set the com-
plete action of his first full-length play,
“The Plebeians Rehearse the Upris-
ing,” in East Berlin on that day of
revolution 14 years ago. The East Ger-
man Government panicked and called
in Soviet tanks that, according to Grass,
A Brecht enthusiast, Lotte Lenya,
demonstrates loyalty for The Boss
promptly patrolled Stalinallee looking
for mythical invaders from the West
and flattening at least one home-
revolutionary of the East.
The four Acts all take place on the
stage of real-life dramatist Berthold
Brecht’s Berlin theatre, where Brecht
himself (called “The Boss” in the play)
is conveniently supposed to be rehears-
ing his own version of Shakespeare’s
“Coriolanus.” The revolutionaries keep
on coming in from the streets and spill-
ing over into the theatre. The plebeians
of Shakespeare’s Rome and the workers
of Brecht’s Berlin become interchange-
able on the stage, just as The Boss be-
comes at times a parallel to the figure
of Coriolanus.
Grass does not spare Brecht. The
creator of “Mother Courage” is pre-
sented as a paper-hero, an intellectual
fence-sitter, condemned to see both
sides of the question, but taking none
when it comes to action. He is shown
shilly-shallying between the rioters and
his conscience, caught in a dilemma of
his own making should he Only
A Brecht detractor, Guenter Grass,
demonstrates for a German newspaper
preach or should he practise, too? He
refuses both a plea from a deputation
to become the workers’ spokesman and
Government representative’s request to
denounce the revolt. Like Coriolanus,
The Boss lets everyone down in the
end, including himself.
As one West German critic said
after the premiere, “Grass deals Brecht
a knockout blow.” It seems to have
been below the belt, too; Brecht’s true
attitude to the 17 th June uprising has.
remained completely unknown, as an
appendix to this English edition states.
Evidence does exist, however, in secret
documents in possession of his heirs.
As far as I know, his widow, the
world-famous actress Helene Weigel
(Volumnia in the play), still lives in the
East. At the time of his death, it was
strongly rumored that Brecht himself
was about to defect into the West.
Guenter Grass is without doubt Ger-
many’s greatest living novelist. His
masterpiece, “The Tin Drum,” will
probably be counted as one of this cen-
tury’s outstanding works of literature
altogether. But “The Plebeians Rehearse
the Uprising” does not seem very good
theatre. It cannot be effective on stage
when all the main characters are in-
decisive: the Roman crowd, the rebel-
ling Berlin workers, and The Boss him-
self.
A great author is not necessarily also
a great dramatist, but perhaps Grass
will still find his stage-legs; at present
he is groping. However, “The
Plebeians” makes quite interesting arm-
chair theatre; it is a play to be read
rather than seen; there are some memor-
able lines of blank verse and some
pungent comment on the German
character. The basic philosophy is per-
suasive: that revolutions, whether in
Rome, in Shakespearian England, or in
East Berlin in 1953, are interchangeable,
that people always remain the same
and that anti-heroes, whether their name
is Coriolanus or Berthold Brecht, go on
reacting in the same manner.
In basing his first play on “Corio-
lanus,” one of Shakespeare’s less suc-
cessful dramas, Grass seems to be delib-
erately tempting fate, anyway. Shake-
speare helped himself to Plutarch and
Livy, most likely in order to make
safely remote social comment on the
Gunpowder plot and early Jacobean
unrest. Brecht rewrote Shakespeare
without conspicuous merit also for his
own political motives. Did Grass really
imagine he could succeed in rewriting
them all?
Setting up another one of these
manufactured strawmen and burning
him in effigy is a childish prank for Guy
Fawkes night. It is apparently not the
stuff of which great dramas are made.


Old-new Russia
By A. J. P. TAYLOR
The Russian Empire 1801-1917. Hugh
Seton-Watson. Oxford University
Press. $8.55.
THE OXFORD HISTORY of Europe
is approaching its subject from the
extremities. Last year Raymond Carr
presented Spain. Now Hugh Seton-
Watson presents Russia. The two books
have some curious similarities and some
curious contrasts. Both countries lay
out of the general European current.
Both had a distinctive pride or even
arrogance. Both countries needed or
hankered after liberalism in the 19th
century and neither found it.
Spain played practically no part in
European policies, except as an object
of occasional disputes; Russia was a
leading Power. Despite this, Spanish
history is unmistakably European in
feeling, whereas Russian history re-
mained strangely out of the contempor-
ary mood, and one is left wondering:
should Russia have been included in a
Nicholas II... more intelligent?
History of Europe at all? This query
is not provoked solely by Seton-
Watson’s book. It is the deepest theme
in modern Russian history. Of course,
Russia is more European than anything
else, but it is European with a differ-
ence and always has been.
•* Many people nowadays read the
history of old Russia, because of what
happened at the end. Their main in-
terest is in the last sentence which
announces the coming of the Bolsheviks.
Professor Seton-Watson, with admirable
detachment, writes about Russian his-
tory for its own sake and presents the
Bolsheviks before 1917 as a minor sect
in a relatively unimportant party. He
is quite right. So far as the Bolsheviks
had a background, it was to be found
in the general history of European
Socialism, not in that of Russia.
With the Bolsheviks safely out of the
way, Mr. Seton-Watson can concentrate
on the topics which distinguish Russian
history and make it interesting. He has
an excellent grasp of even the most
recent work on the subject and has
brought the huge rambling empire into
firm discipline. Maybe the discipline is
a little too strong. There is an atmos-
phere of purpose throughout the book,
particularly on the institutional side, as
though successive Tsars and their
advisers really knew what they were
doing. The truth lies rather the other
way. Russia’s imperial Government
lurched from one expedient to the next
and hit on occasional success only by
mistake, much as the Soviet Govern-
ment does now.
Mr. Seton-Watson has not altogether
escaped the occupational weakness of
historians, who tend to think that
because men hold great positions there
must be something great about them.
It can be maintained that three out of
the five Tsars handled by Mr. Seton-
Watson were slightly above the mon-
archical average. Alexander I was clearly
an improvement on, say, his contem-
porary, Francis I of Austria, and Alex-
ander II did more good in the world
than William I of Prussia. But even
these two were on no very high level,
and the best that Mr. Seton-Watson
can say for poor Nicholas II is that he
was “more intelligent and more sensi-
tive than his father.”
The Russian statesmen, too, get a
more charitable treatment than they
deserve. Most of them were content
to air general propositions and then
allowed the administration to run itself.
On the other hand, Mr. Seton-Watson
discusses most effectively the ideas and
achievements of the various reformers or
revolutionaries. In particular, he shows
that the Westerners represented a
belated form of the Enlightenment and
that the various Slavophiles were not
merely suffering from racial illusions.
His emphasis on treating everything
from the Russian point of view is fully
justified, but it has one undesigned
result. It gives the impression that
Russia was all alone in the world, as
remote from Europe as if it were on a
different planet. There is very little
about the relations between Russian and
West European thought, and the reader
discovers only by accident that many
leading Russians spent much of their
lives outside Russia.
The treatment of foreign policy,
though again justified, strengthens this
impression. It seems that the only object
of Russian policy was to keep Europe
at a distance. There is virtually nothing
about the great problems which stirred
others, such as the unification of Italy
or expansion overseas. Once Napoleon
had been expelled, Europe presented
itself to Russia in the two problems of
Poland and Turkey. Neither problem
was solely external. Poland, as Mr.
Seton-Watson remarks, was Russia’s
Ireland, and Turkey concerned the
Slav kindred in the Balkans. Russian
foreign policy was essentially defensive,
as it has continued to be, and Mr.
Seton-Watson has done well to reinforce
this lesson.
This is altogether a very good book.
It is not exciting to read and it does
not strive after effect. It is overloaded
with information here and there. But
it succeeds in giving a clear picture of
a most extraordinary country, and even
those who think themselves expert in
Russian history can learn from it.

The Enlightenment: An interpretation.
Peter Gay. Weidenfeld and Nicolson.
Nicolson.
ALL HISTORIANS AGREE that the
Enlightenment was an important event
in the intellectual history of mankind,
but they are not able to agree on what
Dostoevsky... muddied waters
it was. Some, like Kant, defined it as
man’s emergence from his self-imposed
tutelage, or as man’s claim to be recog-
nised as an adult, responsible being.
Others, like Dostoevsky, defined it as
the work of the “men who muddied the
waters.”
The main achievement of Peter Gay’s
excellent if somewhat long - winded
(over 550 pages) work is that he sets
out quite clearly what the men of the
Enlightenment stood for. In the Over-
ture he sets this out in abstract language.
“The men of the Enlightenment,” he
writes, “united on a vastly ambitious
program, a program of secularism,
humanity, cosmopolitanism, and free-
dom . . . freedom from arbitrary power,
freedom of speech, freedom of trade,

freedom to realise one’s talents, free-
dom of aesthetic response, freedom, in
a word, of moral man to make his own

He is careful to insist that the unity
did not mean unanimity. Some de-
nounced religious belief as infamous
and advocated atheism and materialism:
some clung to some vestiges of religious
belief. Even Voltaire, for all his under-
graduate intellectual clowning against
anyone naive enough to call God the
“author and giver of all good things,”
resisted the temptation to drag Christ
into the mud. The French men of the
Enlightenment waged their war against
superstition, against arbitrary govern-
ment and a savage penal code. The
English men of the Enlightenment
seemed quite happy with their existing
political and social institutions, includ-
ing even the Church of England. The
German men of the Enlightenment did
not even dream of any changes in
their political institutions.
Yet Peter Gay, who is professor of
history at Columbia University in New
York, wisely insists on the ground held
in common between these lay preachers
of the doctrine of human perfectability.
For him the hero of the Enlightenment
Voltaire ... resisted temptation
was David Hume. He, in Gay’s words,
ct ...
was willing to live with uncertainty,
. . ° , . . 1
with no supernatural justifications, no
complicated explanations, no promise
of permanent stability, with guides of
merely probable validity, and, what
is more, he lived in his world without
complaining, a cheerful stoic . . Hume
makes plain that since God is silent,
man is his own master: he must live
in a disenchanted world, submit every-
to criticism, and make his own
way.”
It is a simple and moving statement
of a faith by which many people live.
For those who share this vision of the
human situation, Gay’s work deserves
to live on as a source of inspiration, as
well as an example of the vast industry
of German-American scholarship. Per-
haps one should add a small footnote.
In intellectual circles there always are
the Humes and the Turgenevs: there
are also the Rousseaus and the Dosto-
evskys who are mad enough to uncover
their view to them. So one can take
away another lesson from reading Peter
Gay, namely that when you meet a
Hume, pull the mask on quickly.
Inside a movie
By JOHN BAXTER
Two For The Road. Frederic Raphael.
Jonathan Cape. $2.65.
ONCE IN A WHILE, every reviewer
gets a book which enchants him. This
is mine. In the space of 142 pages it
says a dozen things that have needed
saying for years, both about the modern
cinema and the place of literature in
relation to it. The form a long
introductory essay on screen writing
followed by the screenplay of Raphael’s
latest film is ideal as a vehicle for
the author’s ideas, but its success would
not have been half as triumphant had
not the screenplay been the best he
has written since his superb “Nothing
But The Best.”
The author’s preface, a note on the
problems of writing for the screen which
unrolls into an extended attack on
hypocrisy in literature (and book
reviewing), combines intelligence with
controlled passion. Beginning with an
assault on such inhabitants of the
cinema as producers (“. . . a man who
takes the only remaining bottle of
water from a man dying of thirst in
the desert and spits into it to improve
the flavor”), he demolishes as well the
French film critics of the magazine
“Cahiers du Cinema,” the drearier
forms of literary criticism, and in
general the cult of “art” which has
kept the cinema isolated from liter-
ature and experience. Raphael’s
attack exhibits an unshakable belief in
the right and duty of the writer to be
guided only by what he personally feels
and believes.
That Raphael’s mind is one of the
best being applied to modern screen
writing is amply proved by the script of
“Two For The Road,” a gay, per-
ceptive essay in the mechanics of mar-
riage which follows logically fVom
earlier novels like “The Graduate Wife”
and “The Limits of Love.” The intel-
ligent and individual young couple of
“Two For The Road” coming to terms
with the deficiencies of their relation-
ship are, in fact, extensions of the Ban-
nermans in “The Trouble With Eng-
land,” one of his best short novels, but
the necessities of the cinema have
polished and perfected them so that
the weight of Raphael’s characterisa-
tion is brought more accurately to bear.
There is no fat on this script; intel-


lectually and dramatically it has a pace
that sends one hot-foot to see the film.
To the person interested in cinema
technique, “Two For The Road” is
invaluable reading. The author’s
vision of editing is advanced, and he
has constructed the script in such a way
as to employ and extend his skill in
the juxtaposition of story and situation.
Taking as his motif the journey from
England to the South of France by
boat and road, he juggles chronology
to show the young couple of his story
travelling the same route at five key
times in their lives.
The fifth journey, contemporary
with the film’s beginning, is the most
important. The husband is a successful
architect, his wife attractive, edgy,
bored, but as they cruise in their
Mercedes to the Cote D’Azur the sur-
roundings remind them of their earlier
experiences along the same road. In a
plot of daunting complexity, Raphael
juggles past and present to show the
modulation of emotion by time and
circumstances, the sadness of love and
desire souring over the years, but as
well the final possibility of a new basis
for affection. “Two For The Road” is
a sad, beautiful piece of work made
all the more memorable for the state-
ment of principles which precedes it.
Pitiless
By NANCY KEESING
Black Angels. Bruce Jay Friedman.
Cape. $2.30.
Old Crow. Shena Mackay. Cape. $2.65.
IF YOU LIKE YOUR fiction plainly
written and unambiguous, then neither
of these books is for you. Both are by
exponents of “black humor.” The novel,
“Old Crow,” is written by a young (23,
and two previous books) Scottish
woman; the short stories, “Black
Angels,” by an American author known
to readers of “Esquire,” “Playboy,” and
“Saturday Evening Post.”
There are surprising points of simil-
arity between these authors, although
no one could mistake the voice and
style of one for that of the other. Both
compress, select, whittle to the bone.
Both are concerned to expose weak-
nesses in selected societies, to point out
cruelty, failure of communication, mis-
placed faith, etc. you name your
sickness of the age, they’ll explore it.
Friedman’s stories range the world as
well as presenting aspects of the Ameri-
can scene. Shena Mackay stays put in
one small village.
I question the effectiveness of using
utterly grotesque characters and either
fantastic or highly exaggerated situa-
tions in making social comment in-
tentionally ephemeral satire excepted.
One cannot label either writer “slick.”
But both are without pity, mercy, or
compassion.
Some readers might argue that Shena
Mackay has compassion for her fallen
village beauty, Coral Fairbrother. This,
I doubt indeed, strip this book of its
modernistic trappings, and sentimen-
tality of a rather sloppy kind will be
found to color her view of Coral. And
Coral is, anyway, too grotesque, too
invented, a non-person without flesh-
and-blood reality. She is a shadow sub-
stitute for the hundreds of thousands
of unfortunate Corals who do exist and
who are destroyed by malice and un-
sympathy. If anything or anyone real
surrounded Coral she would be a
character, but the horrible people of
her village are figments, and her land-
scape, rotting house, and hungry fields
are gauze drop curtains.
Or have I, darkly, missed the point
of these black jokes?

A Substantial Ghost. Violet Powell.
Heinemann. $4.45.
IN 1909 A CARTOON by Max Beer-
bohm appeared in the London “Daily
Mail” showing an Edwardian woman
frowning down at a Victorian miss and
saying, “So! Now at last we see you in
your true colors!” The cartoon fol-
lowed publication of “My Recollec-
tions,” the memoirs of Lady Cardigan,
then still triumphantly and vindic-
tively alive, aged 85. She was the
widow of Lord Cardigan, who, in the
long intervals between leading the
Charge of the Light Brigade and lend-
ing his name to a homely article of
clothing, managed to be the most
hated man in the British Army and
to have a disordered private life.
Lady Cardigan’s memoirs would not
shock anyone today; they interested
Lady Violet Powell because they were
the work of Maude ffoulkes, believed
to be the first literary ghost. Lady
Violet battles her way expertly through
the ramifications of English society
and European families as Mrs. ffoulkes
had to do for her work (Lady Violet’s
grasp of the framework of family must
be a great help to her husband,
Anthony), but Mrs. ffoulkes keeps dis-
appearing in true ghostly fashion.
In later life Mrs. ffoulkes appropri-
ately became interested in spiritualism
and, in her own unghosted memoirs,
provides an anecdote about a lover who
had caused her some anguish. Return-
ing from a funeral at Kensal Green,
this man lost his way. and stumbled
on to the grave of another discarded
mistress. In post-funeral depression, he
noted it was untended and jotted down
the number, intending to have some-
thing done about it. When he got
home, depressed still, he rang a friend,
but on the line came the voice of
the dead woman, assuring him she

River of Gold. Hector Holthouse. Angus

THE GOLDRUSH at Palmer River,
on Cape York, lasted about seven years
in the 1870 s, but with 35,000 diggers
(including warring factions of Chinese
and Australia’s fiercest native tribes)
it was this country’s wildest while it
lasted. Brisbane journalist Holthouse
has researched the story of those days
well to make a lively and very readable
book.
Three-quarters success
A Time To Die.
Jacaranda. $3.25.
Kap Pothan.
THE STORY IS SET in the future, but
a future so close it might, perhaps, be
tomorrow. Australia has been invaded
by the huge armies of fictitious
“Indoasia.” Britain has turned her back;
America has preferred not to provoke a
full-scale war with China, so the Aussies
have gallantly “gone it alone” and
been defeated.
Clin McKellar and Paul Wallace,
soldier and airman respectively, are
two young men very different in every
way from each other. Both have miracu-
lously escaped death and have estab-
lished guerilla bands, one at Pittwater,
the other somewhere in the Blue Moun-
tains. How they set to organising their
followers, to harassing the enemy, and
what happens when they eventually
meet make an exciting story. It is
written well enough, although without
distinction. The first three-quarters of
the book is convincing and horrifying.
The conclusions I found rather lame
and unresolved. It is Pothan’s first
novel.

American influence
One of a series, "Living is an Art,"
by SHEELAH WOOD
MRS. JOHN AMORY, one of Aus-
tralia’s leading equestriennes, is a tall
young woman with flaming red hair.
But, contrary to the general belief about
redheads, she is a most equable and
unruffled creature who sails through life
with great serenity.
Judy Amory was born in Sydney and
lived all her unmarried life on a sheep
station at Quirindi. She met her hus-
band, a young lieutenant in the Ameri-
can Navy,' on a blind date during the
war. John was a graduate in architec-
ture from Harvard University, where
he studied under the great Walter
Gropius.
Immediately after the war they lived
in Washington, where Mr. Amory be-
came curator of the Naval Museum at
Annapolis. While they were living there
Mrs. Amory helped in a riding school
in return for the loan of horses on which
she hunted with the various hunt clubs
of Virginia. But she got homesick for
Australia and they returned here, with
John as a representative of the Ameri-
can State Department Foreign Building
Office, in which capacity he helped to
supervise the beautiful American Em-
bassy buildings in Canberra.
On completion of his assignment he
returned to Washington and became
assistant to David Finlay, the Director
of the National Gallery, which houses
the Mellor Collection. They bought
a house in Georgetown and proceeded to
dispense hospitality to all dollar-starved
travelling Australians.
Then John Amory got homesick for
Australia and, with their two children,
Megan and Jonathan, they returned to
live in Hunter’s Hill in a century-old
sandstone house, which Mr. Amory
has restored to its former Georgian
simplicity.
Mrs. Amory’s father was a well-known
amateur rider at country race meet-
ings, and she started “riding work” for
her father when she was ten years old.
She has progressed through all phases
of riding, from jumping to the three-
day events, and now is concentrating
on the ultimate art in horsemanship—
dressage. This is her passion.
She keeps her team of horses at the
bottom of the garden in waterfront
stables overlooking the Parramatta
River and walks them up through the
garden proper to her horse-float, which
is permanently parked outside the
house, waiting to take off to her classes
and exercise fields.
She visits the Royal Shows in all
States and has managed to teach both
her children to ride well, which is no
mean feat when you do it from a sub-
urban location with a Land-Rover and
horse-float as an essential requirement
of the job.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Amory love
entertaining and do a lot of it. They
like to ask people “who do things” to
their parties. Theatrical people, artists,
writers, musicians, and lots of young
people. Now that Megan has left
school they entertain a great deal more
and they usually have a buffet with
small tables. They expect, and get,
help from their guests. The accent is
informal. Their Sunday luncheons in
the garden under the enormous jaca-
randas are famous for their relaxed
atmosphere.

MARION RAYMOND'S
COOKBOOK
They'll queue up
smiling in
this soup kitchen
Take that soup away!
Oh, take that nasty soup away!
I won’t have any soup today!
Like Strewel Peter with his fuzzy
hair and lengthy fingernails, I never
was too keen on soup as a child. The
years have changed my mind. A good
home-made soup and a crusty loaf
can be a regal meal. But to this day
I feel insulted if I am offered soup,
unadulterated, out of a tin or a pack-
age. Here are some quick ways to
achieve gourmet-style soups.
Caldos de Indianilla is to Mexico
City what’ onion soup is to Paris. It
can be made with prepared stock, since
poaching the chicken breast in the
broth, and adding onion and spices to
it, will soon dispel any suspicions that
the stock is not your own.
Into six cups of chicken broth place
1 chicken breast, 2 sliced onions,
teaspoon coriander, \ teaspoon oregano,
1 teaspoon good curry powder, \ tea-
spoon salt, and teaspoon freshly
ground black pepper. Bring to the boil
and simmer for 20 minutes or until
breast is tender. Remove the chicken
and allow to cool. Strain stock and
discard onion. Remove skin from
chicken and cut into julienne strips.
Just before required, heat soup with
chicken strips, peel one or two avocados
and slice. Pour soup into bowls and
add avocado strips, which will float on
top.
(Cheating) Borscht. Into 2 pints of
stock made from 2 chicken and 2 beef
broth cubes pour one tin of red cab-
bage (not pickled); add 2 tablespoons
of vinegar, a bayleaf, 6 peppercorns,
a sprinkle of dill seeds, a teaspoon of
sugar, and £ teaspoon of salt. Bring
to the boil and simmer for ten minutes.
Remove bayleaf and peppercorns. Just
before required to serve, stir in
carton of sour cream.
In Russia this soup would be accom-
panied by meat patties called Pirozhky.
Make them with puff pastry, shape
them like a cornish pasty (triangular),
and fill them with a well-seasoned mix-
ture of minced beef, onion, and a hard-
boiled egg. Brush the patties with
beaten egg and bake in a hot oven
for 15 minutes until nicely browned.
Minestrone from Liguria is an inter-
esting collection of vegetables, delicious
on a cold night. Hot garlic bread served
with it makes it a filling supper.
Into a large pot containing 4 pints
of stock pour 3 tablespoons of olive
oil and bring to the boil. Add 2
chopped cloves of garlic, 3 large sliced
potatoes, 2 sliced onions, 3 sliced
carrots, chopped celery, a peeled and
sliced aubergine, and the shredded
heart of a cabbage. (You can also
pop in any left-over vegetables from
your refrigerator.) Add a handful of
red kidney beans and simmer the
minestrone for at least 2 hours the
longer the better. Add of pasta
some 15 minutes before required to
eat macaroni or bucatini is best.
Fry a rasher of bacon per person and
crumble it into the soup bowls. Make
a paste of chopped garlic, oil, and
parmesan cheese, add a sprinkle of
basil, and stir into the soup before
serving.
Crab Gumbo. You can buy superb
King Crab meat nowadays in almost
any supermarket or fish shop. But,
when you’re stuck, a can of crab meat
(the large one) will do.
Combine 2 tablespoons of butter with
2 tablespoons of oil and heat until
butter has melted. Add 1 chopped
onion, a chopped clove of garlic, and
1 chopped capsicum, and saute until
tender. Blend in 2 tablespoons of flour
and make a roux, stirring constantly
until well blended and thickened. Sea-
son with salt and freshly ground black
pepper. Add a thin strip of lemon peel
and a good dash of tabasco sauce.
Stir in fib. of defrosted crab meat
and 1 large can of Italian peeled
tomatoes. Simmer for 10 minutes. Stir
in \ pint of milk and pint of fresh
cream. When heated through remove
lemon peel and serve. If you are a
curry fan like me you will find a good
sprinkle of curry powder a pleasant
addition to this soup.
Quick Prawn Bisque is for tinned-
soup addicts. Only, if you don’t tell
your guests, they will never know you
didn’t make it yourself. Take a tin of
mushroom soup, a tin of tomato soup,
and place in a large saucepan. Add 1
pint of milk to the two tins of soup
and stir over medium heat until
blended. Quickly bring to the boil and
stir in a tin of prawns or imported
shrimps (including the juice). Reduce
heat. Stir in pint of fresh cream and
serve sprinkled with chopped chives,
and with a hot, crusty loaf.
Elzekaria is a basque bean and cab-
bage soup. To half a cup of olive oil
add 1 tablespoon of pork fat and heat
gently. Add 2 cloves of garlic. When
this begins to discolor add 1 coarsely
shredded, average-size cabbage and lib.
of dried beans. Cover with beef stock
and season well. Bring to the boil and
simmer until beans are tender, adding
more stock from time to time as
required. Cube a quarter pound of
salami and add to the pot about 15
minutes before serving. Eaten with hot
garlic bread this is a meal in itself.

pick-me-up of France for those who
have drunk too well. It should be
served in eathernware soup bowls and
prepared in an earthenware marmite.
Failing this, the china-clad ironware is
better for cooking than aluminium.
Slice lib. of Spanish onions finely.
Melt about 2oz. of butter in the mar-
mite, fry the sliced onions until trans-
parent with a bayleaf, a crumbled clove,
and 2 or 3 crushed cloves of garlic.
Add salt, freshly ground black pepper,
and a pinch of brown sugar. Prepare
2 pints of beef stock, heat, and pour
over onion in the marmite. Simmer
soup for at least half an hour the
longer the better. f Just before required,
fry a slice of bread per person. Place

sprinkle generously with gruyere cheese.
Pour soup over bread. Have additional
grated gruyere cheese available on the

Tan Hua Tang is a Chinese soup
which is quick to make and also very
good for a light lunch. Into 2 pints of
chicken stock place 2 chopped sprigs
of parsley, J cup of chopped chives or
6-8 spring onions, 6 small skinned
tomatoes, and season to taste. Add
teaspoon of monosodium glutamate and
bring to the boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.
Whisk 2 eggs and apportion to four
soup bowls. Pour over the boiling soup
which will cook the eggs and
serve with hot toast.
Lentil Soup is something I can eat
until the cows come home, but it is
very filling and you won’t want much
but bread and cheese to follow. Knorr
made an excellent one in a packet, but
my grocer assures me that they have
ceased manufacture. If you can still
rustle up a packet or two in your
grocery store, do so you won’t
regret it. However, use half a pint less
water then they recommend in the dir-
ections, add two tablespoons of white
vinegar, and just before serving stir in
£ carton of sour cream. The- addition
of pieces of debrecen (Hungarian garlic-
type sausage) makes it a true meal in
itself.
If, like me, you’re reduced to having
to make it yourself, you’ll need a ham
bone from the grocer. Boil it in 3 pints
of water and make your stock. Add 1
large onion, 2 large carrots, a stalk of
celery all roughly chopped salt,
pepper, 2 cloves of crushed garlic. Fry
2 cups of lentils lightly for 5 minutes
in oil and add to the stock pot. Simmer
for approximately 2 hours. Remove
about 4 tablespoons of lentils and set
aside. Put the remainder of the stock
through a moule or sieve and reheat.
Take a tablespoon of flour and mix
with some of the liquid, return to the
soup to thicken. Add \ carton of sour
cream and 2 tablespoons of vinegar
and stir gently over low heat. Add
reserved lentils and serve with
sausage, or bread croutons, or just by
itself.

LETTERS
Aid to North Vietnam
Mr. Hartnett’s letter (8., September 6)
is a postscript to a shabby tale. The
circular sent to academic staff at Mel-
bourne University and signed by Mr.
Hartnett in his capacity as president
of the SRC stated:
“It is unnecessary to detail reports of
the destruction and damage in North
Vietnam, suffice to say that the present
level of 50,000 tons of bombs per month
is only paralleled by the saturation
bombing of Germany.
“Aid is needed in North and South
Vietnam for economic and social de-
velopment, in the fields of housing, pro-
vision of employment, medical care, and
public health services.
“All money collected will be dis-
tributed through World University
Service and International Red Cross to
both North and South Vietnam.”
At a meeting in Melbourne on July
31 last, it was pointed out that WUS
had no representatives in North Viet-
nam, and that the International Com-
mittee of Red Cross was not allowed
to send representatives to North Viet-
nam despite the fact that the Hanoi
Government is a signatory to the
Geneva Convention.
Mr. Hartnett, who was at this meet-
ing, acknowledged these points and
stated that the money would be sent
to the Canadian Legation in Hanoi.
Subsequent inquiries determined that
there is no Canadian Legation in Hanoi.
On August 2, a letter by Mr. Hart-
nett was published in the Melbourne
“Age” in which he repeated his claims
regarding WUS and ICRC.
If statements by Mr. Justice Nimmo
are correct, it would appear that despite
the refusal of Hanoi to admit ICRC
representatives to North Vietnam, the
ICRC is sending medical supplies to
Hanoi to be used presumably as the
Government thinks fit. This state of
affairs is now being used as an ex post
facto cover for “aid to North Vietnam”
operations.
It is difficult to avoid the inference
that had no fuss been raised a large
sum of cash would have been forwarded
to the Hanoi Government.
Since the Melbourne University
administration was talked into support-
ing Hartnett’s appeal, the only honor-
able course left to the University
authorities seems to be to take over
the running of the appeal and the
accounting of the funds, and send the
money to the Australian Army in Viet-
nam for the Civilian Aid Program in
Phuoc Tuy province.

Dr. Wyndham's invitation
With reference to Daphne Guinness’
article on the Granville Boys’ High
School art exhibition at the Darling-
hurst Galleries (8., August 26), and a
subsequent letter from the Principal of
the school, Mr. M. J. Maiden, I would
like to clarify some misapprehensions.
Before publishing her article Mrs.
Guinness phoned me at the school and
inquired whether an invitation had
been sent to Dr. Wyndham, the Direc-
tor-General of Education. I, in turn,
was informed by those responsible for
posting the invitations that one had
been dispatched and that to their know-
ledge no reply had been received.
Consequently, I must apologise on
Mrs. Guinness’ behalf, and on the be-
half of the Principal of the school, that
I issued this information without auth-
ority. I must also add that conclusions
drawn (referred to in Mr. Maiden’s
letter) as to the relevance of Dr. Wynd-
ham’s absence were entirely those of
Daphne Guinness or of her readers, not
necessarily reflecting my own views.

The Vietnam amendment
Kindly correct inaccuracies of Alan
Reid. Vietnam amendment at Federal
ALP Conference was moved by me, not
by Brown of Victoria, and represented
not the domination of one wing but the
considered opinion of an overwhelming
majority of the Conference and of other
civilised Australians.

[Alan Reid writes: It is true that Mr.
Batt moved the motion, but it was
seconded by Mr. Brown and partly
drafted by Dr. Cairns in words similar
to those he had used consistently in
speeches.]
Will N.Z. turn?
Michael Baume’s “Will New Zealand
Turn to Japan?” (8., September 9) is
a misnomer. The article could more
appropriately be named “Will New
Zealand Turn to Cow Manure?”
I have been in Australia three weeks
after being forced from my New
Zealand by threats of libel actions. In
Auckland I had the audacity to publish
a satirical newspaper which suggested
(among other obscenities) that New
Zealand would be better run by the
cows (i.e., they can apply all the bull
they want and get away with it).
New Zealand is in a mess. Pragmatic
and reasonable reforms are recom-
mended and forgotten, public apathy
is enormous, and Baume’s suggestion
that New Zealanders have strong
opinions is erroneous in the extreme.
Most of them have swallowed the
“Welfare pill” and now enjoy their

Antipodean slumbers with the rest of

It is hoped that a “government in
exile,” located in Sydney (which is the
fifth biggest city in New Zealand), will
eventually be able to land on those
green shores and with honest sweat
deliver New Zealand screaming and
bloodied into the 19705. Perhaps we
can make it! We have nothing to lose
but our cows and twenty-five hours’
sleep per day.

Alignment with Japan
Your leading article “Australia
Japan’s Other Island” was an inspira-
tion and its warning a trumpet call
that Australia must align with an
oriental group. To me Japan is the
answer, there is no other choice. A
union of the two islands could well be
the solution to any future problems,
not to mention producing an economic
flowering as well as a cultural one for
both countries.

Living is an art
Would like to compliment you on your
wonderful weekly magazine. Have just
returned to Australia after many years
of absence and have been kept well
informed about the various happenings
in Australia and abroad through your
excellent weekly.
My friends in Canada and America
found the articles by Sheelah Wood,
“Living Is An Art,” most interesting.
You have given many people many
hours of enjoyment. Hope you con-
tinue to keep up this standard.

Ruling the waves
A short answer to “Defend Australia:—
Where?” by a CMF officer (8., Septem-
ber 16) is, at sea. To paraphrase Francis
Bacon’s obiter dictum, he who com-
mands the sea can have as much or as
little of war as he pleases. In this day
and age such command includes, con-
trol of the air above and the waters
below the sea.
If Australia is to exploit the blessing
of being an island nation she needs
strike aircraft carriers (mentioned in
the article) and amphibious forces (not
mentioned) similar to those which
Britain is to have east of Suez in the
1970 s (8000 troops in two assault ships
and one commando carrier).
By overlooking Bacon’s precept, the
U.S.A. has got herself involved in a
land campaign in Asia. Let us
learn from this mistake.

Maybe you think the good taste of Bacardi 8c Cola comes only from the cola? Try again. Try the world’s
largest-selling rum in cocktails, with tonic, with your favorite mixer even all by itself! You’ll find a
very pleasant difference. After all, how do you think Bacardi rum became the world’s largest-selling rum?
