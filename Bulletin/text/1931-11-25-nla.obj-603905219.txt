Have you tried
Verichrome?
Kodak Verichrome Film gives
you good pictures , in the shade,
on dull days, or an hour earlier
or later in the day. And,
besides this, each picture will
be brighter and clearer; faces
and all detail will come out in
crisp vividness.
The reason is Verichrome’s
SIX Points of superiority: —
(1) Double-coated, (2) high
color sensitivity, (3) anti-
glare backing, (4) finer high-
light detail, (5) better shadow
detail, (6) much higher speed
and translucent negative.
Try out Verichrome next week-
end, but remember that: only
Kodak makes Verichrome.

HIS
BOOKS
ë
Stevenson and the
friend who, in
Colvin’s words,
“fastened a quarrel
on him”: —
Henley lived hardly.
Stevenson lived gladly.
He could not forget death. He was not afraid, but he
most assuredly hated the idea of dying. For
Stevenson life was (I think this exactly true) a
twopence colored adventure. To Henley it was
rather a sorry business.... Henley was a stubborn,
sick Englishman, ever in courageous and bitter
rebellion against the bludgeoning of fate, while
Stevenson was a sick Covenanter who contrived to
enjoy bad health.
He enjoyed things exuberantly, like a boy.
While he was fighting for life at Saranac
in 1887 William Archer sent him Shaw’s
novel, “Cashel Byron’s Profession.” Bud-
ding novelists may be comforted by his
summing-up:—
One part Charles Reade; 1 part Henry James or
some kindred author, badly assimilated ; 1 part Dis-
raeli (perhaps unconscious) ; lj parts struggling
overlaid talent; 1 part blooming gaseous folly. That
is the equation as it stands.
“Over Bashville, the footman,” he wrote, “I
howled with derision and delight; I dote on
Bashville —I could read him for ever.” And
so on in. the highest spirits, and without the
shadow of a hint of malice in his mirth.
Mr. Dark gives a full and frank account, of
the circumstances that led to the. writing of
the famous “open letter” in defence of
Father Damien. The attack that inspired
it appeared in a Sydney paper, the “Presby-
terian.” which Stevenson saw shortly after
a visit to Molokai, the leper settlement,
where the old Belgian priest had worked and
died. Most of his friends deplored the
letter. “It is a matchless piece of scorp
and invective.” wrote Walter Raleigh, “not
inferior in skill to anything he ever wrote.
But that it was well done is no proof that
it should have been done at all.” How-
ever. Stevenson was like that. A chivalrous
emotionalist who recked nothing of conse-
quences. One who, as he wrote of poor
Damien, was “superb in generosity, resi-
dual candor and fundamental good humor.”
The (Slipper Fleets
After fighting, ocean-racing is probably
the oldest form of human contest. The
earliest Egyptians put a high value on pace
at sea, and it continued to be one of the
chief concerns of every shipbuilder till the
sixteenth century, when „.gunpdwdcr trans-
formed the-fighting vessels of Europe into
floating forts, and turned men’s thoughts from
speed for a while. But the old ideas soon
revived. The. English owed nearly all their
successes in sea-fighting during the seven-
teenth and eighteenth centuries to the
handiness of their men-o’-war. Neverthe-
less, it was not till the middle of the nine-
teenth century that speed became a master
consideration in the mercantile marine,
Australia was partly responsible. Fully a
third of Cicely. Fox-Smith’s Ocean Racers
(Philip Allan; 155.) is devoted to the crack
British and American sailing-ships that
began to trade with Sydney and Melbourne
after the first gold rush; and the 60-page
chapter on Racing for the Wool Sales is
easily the most thrilling in her book. The
reader forgets she is a woman after a page
or two. Her style is as authoritative and
racily masculine as the conversation of a
deep-sea skipper, and her knowledge of her
subject appears to be encyclopaedic. So
when she offers opinions on debatable points
you take it for granted she is right, and
you have a comfortable feeling' that she
has verified all her facts. She is that- sort
of woman. She gives some fascinating little
biographies of famous ships. The Heather
Bell, for example, was only 500 tons. In
1856 she met easterly gales after leaving
Hobson’s Bay, and took 26 days to beat up
To the Horn; yet her time from Melbourne
to the Start was only 67 days—a record.
“She was st ill going strong under Australian
ownership 30 year's later,” remarks her
warm admirer; and she had beaten steam-
boat time between Brisbane and Sydney
shortly before she was broken up in 1894.
The odd clothes of old-time skippers are
referred to:—
Captain Wood get of the Cutty Sark always sported
a Scotch cap ; some wore bowlers, some “saw-edged”
straws. There were captains in carpet slippers,
captains in elastic-side boots, There was even one
who indicated his agricultural leanings—further
manifested in the shape of a regular poultry ranch
on deck—by clothing his nether man in breeches
and gaiters.
It is impossible by quotations to give
any idea of the mass of sea-lore, some
weighty, some trivial, but all entertaining,
which is packed into this fine volume. No
one who is interested in any form of sailing
should miss it.

exquisite bouquet.
That Hardy’s place wines of
such high quality before the

HARJDY’S WINES OF TINTARA
by & residing of books like 'l he Last Diary of
W. N. P. Barbellion and the Journal of
Katherine Mansfield. In these two books
are set down very clearly the mind
reactions of two people of opposite sex
and of approximately the same age to a
conscious approach of the inevitable. Both
writers are refined, sensitive, cultured, intel-
lectual. They know they have very shortly
to die. And their books show that the re-
actions of like minds to like circumstances,
though the one be possessed by a woman and
the other by a man, are extraordinarily alike.
All symptoms of their naturally opposite
polarities seem towards the end to disap-
pear. Because they were both hypersen-
sitive beings and, therefore, found much
that was good and beautiful in life, there
is the same sort of regretful, reluctant
acceptance of what must be accepted.
There is the same sort of bright courage
and bitterless humor. There is in both
cases, too, a distinct inclining towards some
belief to cling to. And there is in both
cases an extraordinary sensitised imaginative
receptivity—what might be termed a capa-
city for the recognition of the significance of
most trifling things. Katherine Mansfield’s
Journal towards the end is mainly made up
of notes regarding her ever-increasing failure
of physical powers, and little fleeting impres-
sions, drifting memories, set down in simple
and most sufficient language. Barbellion
in his book tends towards the same exquisite
simplicity. The man is the more profoundly
intellectual and scientifically introspective.
The woman is the more daintily perceptive.
Extreme sensibility, as everybody knows,
means increased capacity to suffer; we are
all inclined to forget that it also means in-
creased capacity to enjoy. No human being
who has never suffered deeply can ever
know the deepest enjoyment. We hunger
to enjoy food; we must want, to enjoy life.
And it is probably man’s greater capacity
for suffering that has made him more than
the other animals. It has made the prizes of
living more worth while, and thereby en-
hanced the value of life. Some people will
argue that the other animals can bear suffer-
ing better than man. Wound a man, they
will say, and he will cry out, but wound a
horse to the same extent and he will not
make a sound. But this only refers to physi-
cal suffering, and how a man or any animal
outwardly bears suffering can never be a
true indication of what is suffered. Give
the same number of lashes to two men
and we can be certain that each man will
not have to bear the same suffering, even
physically. And there are mental feelings.
A horse might be sentenced to death, and
it can know nothing of what is coming.
But Katherine Mansfield and Barbellion
see death advancing rapidly upon them,
and because they are losing life they see its
value and beauty. The horse can know
neither their fears nor their hopes. Little
things that would not be noticed by the
horse, or even by human beings of coarser
sensibilities, become for these two people
of great significance. They see beauty that
must be imperceptible to folk who are
not so finely touched as they are. Life
is mostly a matter of compensation. We
receive and we pay for what we receive.
We enjoy and pay in reaction; we suffer
and get paid in the pleasure that is the
relief from the suffering. And our capacity
for both enjoyment and suffering must
depend wholly upon what sort of recording
instruments we are; that is, on our sensibility.
And our sensibility is only very vaguely
indicated externally. When we laugh it is
an indication that we are enjoying our-
selves, but when we are enjoying ourselves
far more acutely and exquisitely we do not
often even smile. And there is a sorrow
beyond tears.
There is something very beautiful in
those little impressions in Katherine Mans-
field’s Journal. She is sick, weak—all mus-
cular energy has practically gone. There
is the cry of pain. There are all the lassi-
tude and, between the hours of suffering, the
almost pleasant tiredness of the invalid. It
is evidently in these periods that come those
little, fleeting, drifting memory glimpses of
bygone things and people and events that
she so daintily sets down. And how clear
they are, and how clean in outline, and
what an exquisite touch there is about
them! One entry tells how once on board
ship her father came down to her cabin
and asked her to walk on deck. All in a
few lines she draws the little picture of
the beginning of that remembered walk—the
encircling darkness of the starlit night,
the lighted decks, her father pausing with
bent head to light his cigar, a steward going
along the deck with a tray of glasses and
stepping over the brass-lined step into the
ship. Barbellion, hopelessly ill, recalls
a postman, a rat. Both these writers are
tuned to receive the daintiest of impres-
sions, and they have both all their lives
been emotional, hypersensitive. So their
memories are both containers of multitudes
of vivid, deeply-etched things.
In Katherine Mansfield’s Journal there is
reproduced a letter written by her to a
soldier friend. Amongst all the minor-keyed
entries it stands out clear and firm and
bold. It shows her as she must have
appeared to people who were acquainted
with her, just as the other entries revealed
her as she appeared to herself. The letter and
the intimate notes reveal different people.
It is the same with Barbellion. In one
entry in The Last Diary, he writes (it is
just after the appearance of His Journal of
a Disappointed Man ): “Friends and rela-
tives say I have not drawn my real self.
But that’s because I’ve taken my clothes
off and they can’t recognise me stark. The
book is a self-portrait in the nude.”
The moon always keeps one side facing
the world and the other side away from
it. If we could see the reverse side>, would
we recognise the moon we know? The
more introspective men or women are the
more two-sided they are—the more like the
moon. Katherine Mansfield and Barbel-
lion were introspectives of the deepest dye.
They were moon people.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
The Book Called “The Sea”
It was like eating ship’s biscuit after a
lifetime on longshore pap, sweetbreads or
souffle.
The machinery of taste and teeth went
rebelliously to work; nevertheless, bits of
baked plaster, breaking into nails and
stalactites, pierced the mouth, or cut dia-
mond patterns across the cushion of the
tongue.
The brine salted it, and a thorny fire
sprang up against the palate, so that the
skin of the cheeks shone red from within.
But it became man’s food directly it
arrived in the stomach; the blood answered
with songs through the body; our arms
branched towards the sky; our ribs grew to
be mighty enough to compass the tonnage
of whales. The whisky we drank kindled
us from head to foot. We made the noise
of conflagrations wherever we went.
We strove among the winds; our legs
being interlocked, we tusselled and sprawled
with them from horizon to horizon; where
we fell, water spouted so high into the air
that the stars returned the streams upon
us in a milk-warm drizzle.
Seagulls dropped through vapory clouds;
and the Conjurer Ocean changed them to
plates, tossing one after another over his
shoulder from left to right.
Then the sun, having scraped away some
of the soot of darkness, put to the aperture
his eye, which appeared like touchwood,
draughtily winking.

Chemistry in Medicine (The Chemical
Foundation, N.Y.; Robertson and Mullens;
7s. 6d.). Patricia Garvan, of New York,
fell ill with grippe and rheumatic fever. The
disease baffled the wits of the city’s greatest
physicians, and the patient died. Her wealthy
parents subsidised the leading experts of
America to write this book as a common-
sense memorial to their daughter. It is
intended to present to the public as well as
to practitioners the great possibilities for
advance in medical science through further
co-operation between chemistry and medi-
cine. All the most interesting and dramatic
phases of the eternal fight are treated in its
750 pages.
Mystery in Red, by Francis D. Grierson
(W. Collins’ Sons; 7s. 6d.). Like Dr.
Nikola, Dr. Bude comes from the East, has
knowledge of strange drugs and does not
stick at murder. Ruthless, reptilian, with
the complexion of a dead man and charming
polished manners, he plots against the red-
haired heroine, Gloria, who, with idiotic
rashness; endeavors to convict him of his
crimes, assisted by her uncle, who is a com-
missioner at Scotland Yard. The denoue-
ment is more improbable than the rest of
the yarn—and that’s saying a lot.
The Adventures of Sidney Reilly, Britain’s
Master Spy, written by himself and edited
by his wife (Elkin Mathews; 10s. 6d. net).
Reilly plotted against the Bolshevik regime
in Moscow years after it had become the
established government. He had great
hopes of Winston Churchill. Treachery be-
trayed him and he fled the country, but he re-
turned later, lured back by agents of the
Tcheka masquerading as counter-revolution-
aries. He was supposed to have been killed,
but his wife believes he is still in a
Russian prison. She at one time meditated
avenging him by embarking on a career of
anarchism. Reilly wrote half the narrative,
his wife the other. Both take it for granted
that readers will regard them as praise-
worthy, and they are full of denunciations
of the Bolsheviks for their endeavors to
check their activities. Yet if they had suc-
ceeded they would have plunged the country
into civil war in which myriads would
have perished. The style of the yarn, which
may or may not be true, suggests William
Le Queux.
And a Little Verse
INHERITING A NAME.
He starts ahead of all the clamoring pack,
He climbs the ladder on his father’s back
And half-way up begins his own ascent,
Fresh, unembittered, confident, content;
And when he slackens pace, or rests, or
lingers,
He treads upon the other fellow’s fingers.

ADAGIO.
Softest strings that breathe on air
Tremulous to Heaven ascend,
Pause and divide harmonious there
And fall and falter till they blend,
And in their union murmur low
While lovelier ecstasies aspire—
True-love’s breasts are taken so
With purest joy, with sweet desire.
Exquisite mouth, that timorously
Quivers and presses warm to mine,
It is a songless minstrelsy
When lovely lips with lips combine;
Yet loves departed sympathise
As music made in earlier years
Melts to sadness in your eyes
And bathes their tender lust in tears.

N. S. WALES AND THE SOVIETS.
The Bulletin’s opinion about the Gov-
ernor’s duty towards liis principal adviser
and the Leg. Council has been expressed
again and again. Either Lang was his
adviser, with a mandate from the people
to do certain things, or he was not. If
he was his adviser, and was stopped by the
Leg Council from carrying the mandate
into effect, then Sir Philip Game was
bound to assist his Minister in his conflict
with the Council. But that would imply the
complete satisfaction of the Governor that
Lang had a mandate for all he proposed to
do. If he proposed to do so much as one
thing for which the mandate was not clear,
and if he sought the assistance of the
Governor to carry that thing, among the
others, into effect, then his Excellency, it
he did his duty, would refuse his assistance.
The Governor is the guardian of the
people, the custodian of their self-
governing rights and privileges. His job
is to see, so far as he can, that his
Ministers are faithful to the principles of
democratic government. The strong weapon
at his command is dissolution, involving
an appeal by his Ministers to the people.
If they seek to do what the people never
authorised, and if he has any doubt at all
whether they would give that authority,
then he is bound to interpose. The con-
tention is quite sound that he must accept
their advice so long as he believes that
they speak with the voice of the people
behind them. When he believes that that is
no longer their position, he must say no to
them till they have consulted the people.
With one reservation he has no right to say
no to them once they have done that and
got the people’s consent.
The position with regard to nominations
to the Leg. Council is not so clear as it is
about other things; and it is here that the
reservation applies. The Leg. Councillor
is appointed not to put through one
measure —except in the case of a projected
abolition—but to assist in carrying on the
government of the country generally, and
indefinitely so far as the N.S.W. Council is
concerned. The Constitution could certainly
never have contemplated that at all times
and under all circumstances the Council
would say “Aye” to the Assembly’s ‘ Aye
and “No’’ to its “No.” If so there would
be no sense or propriety in having a second
Chamber. The function of the Leg. Council
is, therefore, fairly clear: to make sure, not
only that the Assembly and especially the
Government is obeying the people, but that
the matter in dispute, whatever it may be.
has been properly put before the
people. It therefore does not follow that a
N. S. Wales Government which has been
unable to get its measures through the
Council is entitled to a sufficient number of
new Councillors for that purpose. It
would, however, be so entitled after a
favorable vote at a general election in the
course of which the relevant matter was
put to the people in such a way that the
Governor was satisfied they could give a
fair and true answer. None of these con-
ditions have been fulfilled in the -present
case.
It is some small satisfaction to know that,
in consenting to call 25 new members—
nearly all paid Trades Hall officials —to
the Leg. Council, he was not advised by
the British Government. The blunder is
wholly Sir Philip Game’s; the British Gov-
ernment only shares the blame in so far as
it appointed to the position of Governor
one so entirely unfitted for it. His Excel-
lency’s chief business was to guard the rights
of the people, no matter what politicians
this side or the other side of the earth might
tell him. He has not done so. He has not
done so any time in the last six months.
Dn his principal adviser’s first declaration
of his intention to repudiate payments to
the British creditor, his Excellency should
have required an appeal to the people. He
failed then and he has failed ever since.
But if his Excellency has failed so
miserably and over so long a period to
defend the self-governing rights of the
people, it does not follow that all is lost.
In a House of 109 there are these 25 new
members pledged no doubt to do certain
things. There were already 17 Lang Plap
members—a total of 42. Besides these there
are 16 other Labor members, known as the
Coates party, and not followers of J. T.
Lang. These men may do what the Gover-
nor has failed to do. For a true Labor
man no law can be higher than the rule of
the people. His plain duty always is to
give the people a chance to speak, if it has
not already spoken or if its answer is in
doubt. There is reason to believe that even
among the so-called Lang party in the
House there will be found some who will
insist on the maintenance of that funda-
mental democratic principle.
WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR THE
FARMER?
<- The history of farming,” says E. C. Fair-
child, in his “Labor and the Industrial
Revolution,” is “a record of temporary
profits alternating with profound depres-
sion, founded on a file of unceasing,
ill-requited toil. Yet,” he adds, “of all em-
ployments it is most important that the
persons engaged should have the maximum
security it is possible to establish.” After
reviewing the history and position, he
is doubtful of the future, and asks: “Can
stability be found with private ownership
and sales for profit? Or must the funda-
mental task of raising a people’s food
become pa*t of a collective system that
encourages supplies in proportion to public
needs and gives no thought to profit?”
In Australia there is something more
even than the fundamental task of raising
the people’s food dependent on the primary
producer. He must meet our foreign bills,
.too. At the height of its borrowing boom
Australia paid 164 millions in one year for
foreign goods, and it would probably be
uncomfortable to manage now 7 on less than
50 millions’ worth. Add interest on over-
seas debt, and we must sell abroad 80 mil-
lions’ worth annually to keep ourselves
square with the world. The development
of manufacturing industries is enormously
important for our future; but if we can-
not maintain our primary industries we
cannot pay our current debts.
Yet in Australia we know better than
most that for the producer of foodstuffs
life is a series of “temporary profits alter-
nating with periods of profound depres-
sion”; and the position is made worse by
our distance from the great consuming mar-
kets. So on the one hand we have the
indispensability of the industry and on
the other the frightful depressions to which
it is subject—depressions which, while
never seriously threatening to wipe it right
out, certainly do seriously menace it; are,
in fact, seriously menacing it at this
moment. Can anything be done to improve
the position for the faimer? Or must this
fundamental business of raising food
“become part of a collective system”?
The history of farming is more than a
record of temporary success and devastat-
ing failure; it is a record also of schemes
for keeping the farmer on the land in the
face of disaster. In Australia we have one
good-sized advantage. The very qualities
of climate which make wheat-growing so
uncertain make costs of production in a
good season extraordinarily small; also the
qualities which ruin the wheat-farmer make
this the greatest wool-growing country in
the world and win fortunes for the wool-
growers. There remain, nevertheless, a
large proportion who are knocked out by
a succession of wheat failures, and who have
never had a chance to “get into wool.” So
the history of agriculture in Australia dur-
ing the past hundred years has been the
history of agriculture in every other coun-
try with this one difference: that whereas
the struggle elsewhere lias been to keep
men on the land, here it has been to get
them on the land and hold them there.
Lately we discovered an entirely new
bonus sjrstem called exchange. Prices of
wheat in Australia ran up in a few days
nearly Is. per bushel, and farmers who had
seen the season open at about 2s.—which
means Is. 4d. at most country sidings—were
heartened by a rise to 3s. 3d. That two-
fifths of this was merely froth, due to in-
flation, did not seem to them to be of
any consequence whatever. All they knew
was that, whereas formerly the quotation
was 25., now it was 3s. 3d. Unfortunately
it is of the greatest consequence whether
the price is real or fictitious. If it is fic-
titious it cannot be maintained. Friends
of the farmers have been doing their best
to keep the £ Australian worth as little
as possible in terms of other currencies;
the £ Australian has thus been “pegged”
at about 15s. 4d. in English paper money
or 12s. 3d. in American, French or other
gold money. But when more than enough
Australian funds have been accumulated
abroad to meet current demands on those
funds, nothing can prevent a crash in ex-
change. And with that crash the fictitious
part of the rise in wheat, wool and other
prices will disappear. Nothing can stop it.
Meantime the fictitious level, though
liable to change at any time, is having one
very serious result. We are told that wheat
has been sold at 3s. 3d. and wool at 22d.,
that there has been thus a magnificent
recovery in prices and that therefore costs
of production need no longer worry us.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Real prices have recovered very little. Prices
have only seemed to recover because of
the fall in the value of sterling and the
still greater fall in the value of our own
pound. To the extent that these ficti-
tious prices for Australian products have
prevented an adjustment of Australian
costs, they have been a curse rather than
a blessing.
The position of the farmer, then, is that
he is getting the advantage for the moment
of a high rate of exchange, but that this
is an accidental advantage which is liable
to disappear at almost any moment, leav-
ing him with his old high costs unadjusted.
Suppose the exchange crashes —in other
words, suppose the £ Australian gets back
to par with the £ English, and that, of
course, is what we are all supposed to be
aiming at —what then ? What is the posi-
tion of the indispensable farmer going to
be?
E. C. Fairchild, already quoted, could
only see that it might be necessary to make
raising the people’s food “part of a col-
lective system” that “gives no thought to
profit.” Maoriland has adopted something
of that nature; as Queensland also did last
year, it raises the price of the wheat used
within its own boundaries by means of a
sales tax. It is the system that is applied
to Australian sugar. Its virtue is that
the subsidy or bonus is paid for and not
borrowed: under the mongrelised scheme
adopted by the present Federal Govern-
ment, the bill for the bonus is to be paid
out of loans—the fathers eat the bread
and the children are left to pay for it.
These conclusions can, then, be sum-
marised :
Through all ages the farmer has been ill-paid and
liable to periods of great depression.
The present depression is due to a great fall in
prices, to which the farmer’s costs have not been
adjusted.
The recent great rise in prices is due almost
entirely to our £ falling in value, and as this is
merely accidental and temporary, most of the rise
is temporary also and liable to disappear at any
time.
The temporary rise is being used as an excuse
for doing nothing to readjust costs.
Even with the readjustment of costs it may not be
possible to give the farmer security from “a life
of unceasing, unrequited toil” without making the
business “part of a collective system”—that is, by
some system of price stabilisation, based probably
on a bonus or subvention de-rived from a sales tax,
and rising and falling with the price of wheat.
11l their perfectly legitimate effort to re-
duce costs the farmers’ representatives are
attacking the Customs tariff, generally
with enthusiasm, sometimes with fury. But
is it necessary that the farmer should
make this country habitable only by him-
self? If the manufacturer needs high duties
in order to protect himself against the pro-
ducts of cheap-labor countries, he ought
to have them. All that the farmer is
entitled to ask is that, if he is prejudiced
by that protection, he should have it made
up to him in some way; he is not entitled
to demand that the other man shall be
killed in order that he, the farmer, may
live.
There never was a time when the second-
ary industries—in Australia, at any rate —
were as sympathetic with the farmer as
they <a.re to-day. There never was a time
when they were more willing to join in
making the farmer’s life as secure as they
ask that their own shall be.
THEY DO SOME THINGS BETTER IN
QUEENSLAND.
Last year, 1930-31, £4,377,800 was taken
from the pockets of the N. S. Wales people
for unemployed relief. This year, although
totals of income and taxpayers have been
tragically reduced, the yield is expected to
reach £6,000,000. The tax on wages, salaries
and pi-operty income was increased from 3d.
to Is. in the £ by Lang, after he had been
with difficulty restrained from raising it to
5s. —when in pursuit of votes he had led his
mugs to believe that he would abolish it
altogether. This gentleman and two of his
dud Ministers, Badly and Mcßlur, have
the spending of the six millions, “untram-
melled,” the Auditor-General points out,
“except by general directions in the statute.”
When the Pi-emier is away Lang-planning
or gazing at his prize bull, Davidson, who
is as dismal an ass as Badly, is supposed to
take his place on the Unemployment Relief
Council, as it is called. Davidson, however,
does a bit of Lang-planning on his own
account occasionally, and so does Mcßlur,
The uninteresting pair descended on Adel-
aide to help the Lang-plan candidate get
licked so thoroughly at the recent Leg.
Council by-election; and about the same
time their leader, the gentleman farmer,
retired to the society of his bull. So
Badly must have been the Unemployment
Relief Council that week.
This body sits in secret, and treats the
taxpayers with contempt. It never issues
statements to the newspapers, never pub-
lishes returns of unemployed (though this
is done in Britain every week), never in-
vites municipal councils or leaders of indus-
try to co-operate with it, or (after the
necessaiy surgical operation has been per-
formed) assist it with ideas. It hasn’t even
given an account of its stewardship to Par-
liament, although it is distributing the
equivalent of twice the annual revenue of
Tasmania. For the little they know about
its operations the people are indebted to the
Auditor-General. That official reports that
unemployed-relief payments in 1930-31
amounted to £4,357,000 (£20,000 less than
was collected), of which £364,700 was spent
on “public works and services,” £609,700 in
“advances which are recoverable,” and
£1,939,700 on charitable relief and doles
which are not recoverable, and the effect
of which in many cases must have been
utterly demoralising. It is significantly
added that the untrammelled Relief Council
went in for “expenditui'e of a character for
which consideration by Parliament has
always been regai-ded as specially requisite,”
notably a grant of £5OOO to the Furnishing
Trades Society, the secretary of which is an
enthusiastic supporter of Lang. The public
expected that soi’t of thing, and will be
prepared for any further examples that the
Auditor-General may be permitted to fur-
nish. Meanwhile it learns in the newspapers
from time to time that this or that dud
Minister has confessed that one-third of the
expenditure, immense as it is, is going
impostors; that a “check roll-call’' of th®
unemployed at Coaldump was answered b>
100 of the 300 registered, the missing 200
having “jumped the rattler” to Black
Diamond no doubt to collect under false
names there; that, notwithstanding all this,
the Government has abandoned all forms
of relief except the dole, which is too much
for loafers and swindlers and too little for
honest folk.
They order these matters differently m
Queensland. There a “Tory” Government,
with an enterprising Minister of Laboi
and Industry, has made the most of a tax
of 3d. in the £ (really Id. in the 6s. Bd.),
recently raised to 6d. in the £ because of the
fall in national income. It keeps the people
fully informed of what it has done with
their money and what it proposes to do, and
invites them to take a personal interest m
the unemployed by joining the e J;“
vice League, which on June 30 had_ 2b
branches in the metropolitan area and 28
in the country. Issue of rations for which
no return is expected is confined to men
who are travelling through the States in
search of work” (they are “largely recruited
from southern States”), men with doctors
certificates, unemployed women (who may
get at least a day’s work per week making
clothes for the unemployed), and “women
in necessitous circumstances through various
causes.” Men are given 12 weeks’ work,
at the rate of £3 per 44 hours for the mar-
ried and £2 10s. for the single, on water-
conservation, railway-construction, land-
clearing, afforestation, road, bridge, drainage
or reclamation jobs. They are then set to
do “intermittent relief work,” at which
they may earn up to £2 4s. for four days,
until they are eligible for another 12 weeks’.
With the help of private landowners and
organisations, families are being put on
small holdings; many intermittent relief
workers are housed in huts rent-free; for
the boys there are farm- and vocational-
training schemes; for the girls, training in
domestic science. From April 28, 1930, to
June 30, 1931, £702,640 was raised by the
tax, and £669,370 was spent on “payments
to constructing authorities, etc.” (that is, in
providing work), administrative expenses
being kept down to 4.4 p.c. Monthly regis-
trations of unemployed diminished from
28,721 at the end of January, 1931, to
22,403 at the end of June. On the same
date, with considerably less than three
times the population of Queensland, there
were 130,000 unemployed (Government
Labor Bureau’s estimate) in Lang’s State
The Queensland Government has issued
a 46-page report, illustrated, in which practi-
cally every pound of the relief expenditure
is accounted for. Through it runs an obvious
determination to give the people a good
return for their money, and in the main-
tained morale of their unfortunate fellow-
citizens —the preservation in so many
breasts of the will to labor and of hope—they
are getting the best return possible. It is
a fine record of achievement; but N. S.
Wales, with its shilling tax, ought to be
doing even better. The difference is that
Queensland has a real Government, whereas
N. S. Wales has only a travesty of one—an
arrogant mob with no more brains than a
colony of flying-bats.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Railways and the Soviet.
This letter was reported to members as
sent by the general secretary of the Aus-
tralian Railways Union on October 10 of
this year:—-
Mr. A. Losovsky, Secretary R.1.L.U., Dvoretz
Truda, Solianka 12, Moscow, U.S.S.R. Dear Com-
rade, —At a meeting of the Australian Council, which
is the supreme governing body of the Australian
Railways Union, an organisation embracing a majority
of the railwaymen in five of the six States of Aus-
tralia, it was resolved that the union should affiliate
with the R.1.L.U., and, in accordance with the
decision arrived at, I herewith formally make
application for affiliation.
Although the work of the R.I.L.U. is known in
a general way, we have not yet had the privilege
of closely studying your organisation in its detailed
activities. I should be pleased, therefore, if you
would furnish me with the fullest possible informa-
tion regarding our desired affiliation, and also with
any explanatory or propaganda literature issued by
your organisation.
In submitting this application I might add that
the Australian working-class movement has been
somewhat insular in its activities and outlook, and
consequently the great majority of the workers have
not been brought into contact with international
activities or ideas.
My Australian Council is desirous of making known
to Australian railwaymen the aims and objects of
the R.1.L.U., and to enlist their support. Co-opera-
tion at your end to enable this to be done would
be greatly appreciated.
The plain English of this seems to be that
the bosses of the A.R.U., without them-
selves knowing much about it, are pre-
pared to hand the union over to the Rus-
sian Soviet organisation and trust to the
future to convert the members to alle-
giance. Meantime “co-operation at your
end to enable this to be done” will be
greatly appreciated.
Seeing that the bosses of the A.R.I ■
don’t know what the R.I.L.U. is “except in
a general way,” and since admittedly the
rank and file know a great deal less —poor
“insular” and ignorant clods!—it might
have been expected that inquiry would
be made first and affiliation applied for after-
wards if found desirable. But that is not
the Communist way. The Communist seeks
out a “daring minority” which will drag
the “amorphous mass)” —the poor “insular”
l


clods of this letter—with it. In this pro-
cess, of course, “co-operation from your end”
always comes in handy—“co-operation”
being a wide enough term to cover almost
anything. Certainly wide enough to cover
a handy bank-draft.
The question is what should be done
about it. Apparently there is nothing to
prevent an Australian union consisting of
the people’s employees from affiliating
with a Russian Soviet organisation; appar-
ently there is nothing in law to prevent
the affiliation of such an Australian union
being brought off without the knowledge of
the members—certainly without an under-
standing on their part of what it means.
It might be even possible for a union to
be sold into affiliation. But the greatest
care ought to be taken lest the State should
be dragged at the heels of any such union
of State servants.
It has been obvious for a good while
that the position of the public servant in
his relation to the State is quite untenable.
While his numbers were small it was not
of great consequence that he was both
employer and employee; but it became of
the utmost consequence when his numbers
increased, and he was able to command the
services of obsequious and time-serving
politicians, and swing general elections. The
result has been that the employee has
become the master and the taxpayer his
slave. Now there is a grave danger of the
howling anomaly being carried a step
further, and the State sovietised through
this organised public-service vote —in “co-
operation” with “your end.”
There is only one way out, and that
is the complete severance of this public-
service vote. The public servant must
choose his own representatives in Parlia-
ment, if he is to have any representation
at all, and be barred from interesting him-
self in the election of any other represen-
tatives. Without this latest manifestation
of political activity the reform was neces-
sary. With it superimposed, the change
becomes urgent and clamorous.

The Statute of Westminster.
The Statute of Westminster is loaded. It
says that a law passed by the Parliament
at London shall not apply to self-govern-
ing Dominions except by their request
and consent. That creates a mixed position.
The British Parliament can pass laws for
British consumption on any subject under
the sun. But the Commonwealth Govern-
ment can’t, some subjects being reserved
for the State Legislatures. So the question
arises: suppose the Parliament at London
passes a law on some matter and it strikes
the Federal Government as a very good
law, can the Federal Government settle the
question of its jurisdiction by supplying the
necessary request and consent that the
thing shall be good law in Australia? Can
it do this despite the roars of Lang and
the yells of Westralian Jimmy Mitchell?
Or will these people argue the matter of
jurisdiction to a finish every time, and
discuss the problem of their right to give
or withhold their request a.nd consent?
Suppose, further, we got some new imported
and ready-made statutes in this fashion,
will we be able to withdraw the request
and consent at some future date, or will
the law have come to stay?
Theoretically the British Parliament has
power now, and has always had it, to pass
laws that bind the Dominions. In other
words, the sleeping dog was there in theory.
The Statute of Westminster is supposed to
clear away any possible doubt and to assert
that he is a very practical dog, but that if
we accept the Statute he will be present
only in a very limited sense. If we don’t
accept it, presumably he will be there in
an unlimited sense.

The Exchange Tangle.
Exchange has had more public discussion
in Australia in the past few weeks than it
had in all the years that went before. The
explanation is that until now few realised
what a nice, handy semi-political weapon
it could be turned into. One result is
that we have had the extraordinary spec-
tacle of an almost bitter controversy, one
section crying at the top of its voice for
the maintenance of recent high rates, an-
other, for just as selfish reasons in many
cases, demanding that the Australian £
should be restored at the earliest possible
moment to parity with the English £.
We began badly. Throughout last year
the rate was kept very low, although Aus-
tralia’s financial position was very bad. No
doubt the Commonwealth Bank used its
influence to restrain the rate;' probably for
three reasons: (1) Its dread of inflation,
(2) the fact that a high rate means a heavy
drain upon Governments with their big
overseas-interest payments, and (3) its
knowledge that, though it is easy to put
up exchange rates, it is very hard to pull
them down again. Early this year, however,
the Bank of N. S. Wales broke away. The
Australian money available in London was
quite insufficient to meet normal demands,
so that importers had been rationed; and,
realising that they could get a higher
premium than the' banks were offering,
people with Australian money to sell in
London were going past the banks to out-
side dealers. That no doubt was one con-
sideration which influenced the Bank of
The other was that exporters
and therefore primary producers—were
entitled to a higher premium than they
were getting. From 8 p.c. it was run up
to 30 p.c. within a fortnight.
The Bank of N. S. Wales therein did a
great service to the primary producers of
Australia. If the natural or true rate at
which their money could be sold in London
was more than £lOB per £lOO, then they
were entitled to the extra money, what-
ever it might be. And they were entitled
to the extra money so long as it remained
the true or natural rate. But it would be
as wrong for banks or anybody else to
use their resources to hold the rate above
30 p.c. as it formerly was to use their
resources to hold it below 30 p.c. As soon as
anyone says “This is a good thing for the
primary producers”—or for anybody else —■
“let us hold the market accordingly,” then
it becomes market-manipulation and noth-
ing else.
Yet there is a point up to which the banks
may quite properly go. For very many
years they have had what they call a carded
rate —just as they have had a fixed rate
for deposits. The object has been to pre-
vent rapid and violent fluctuations, the
result of a sudden urgent demand for money
or equally the result of a sudden temporary
failure of demand. Business could not be
carried on without this averaging. But as
soon as the banks see that the normal
demand does not justify the price, the price
ought to come down. It is not for them to
consider what effect it will have on this or
that industry. The moment they begin to
take such things into account they become
political institutions, and that means Call-
ing for trouble.
It is said that the banks could not hold
up the price, even if they wanted to,
against the law of supply and demand. But
it is pretty certain that they could do it
for some time: indeed, it might be easier
to hold the price up than to hold it down,
as most obviously was done during the
greater part of last year. To do it they
would have to be prepared to buy all the
Australian money offering in London and
pay the carded price for it; it is because
they have not all been willing to buy at
the carded price that Australian money in
London was sold down to £126 last week.
What ought to be avoided is such a piling
up of credits anywhere that the change will
have to be made suddenly and with great
violence. The very possibility of changes
of that character introduces to business an
element of gambling which ought to be
eliminated wherever possible.

In the Days of Communism.
“The Amalgamated Unemployed Campers’
League of Yarra Bay” recently made
arrangements with Randwick (Sydney)
Council to repair the roads leading to
their premises, but Jock Garden ordered
them to do without roads unless they are
paid full award rates, which the Council
can’t pay, not having the money. Jock
wrote as secretary of the Sydney Labor
Council, which doesn’t labor except with its
jaw, and the leaguers stopped at once. The
habit of obedience is strictly inculcated by
the budding Bolshevik boss, whether his
name is Garden, or Gander, or Gooseflesh
or Schelley, and the rank and file obey him
in the name of liberty, lest they should be
“disciplined.” Should Australia ever achieve
a bona fide Soviet State the acquiescent
private who helped to bring about the
revolution may get the surprise of his life
when he tries to be a Communist, and
finds that it is as difficult to be one under
the new regime as it was to be a capitalist
or a recognised aristocrat under the old
one. When the capitalists and the
employers and the intelligentsia are
squashed, there is room for the Com-
munists to come to the front ,as the ruling
caste; but there is nothing in being a ruling
caste unless there are plenty to rule over.
So those who help along the “cause” by
obeying will find plenty of obeying to do
if the “cause” comes out on top.

“The Case for Westralia.”
Dear Bulletin, —Mr. Brinkley, in his
defence of secession (B. 4/11/’3l), said that
the charges against that movement were
sentimental (including defence) and finan-
cial. I am a Westralian who, like very
many more, want definite answers also to
the following six questions before I can
assist in the breaking up of the Common-
wealth :
(1) Will the secessionists allow the Nor’-West the
same freedom from southern domination as they are
asking from the eastern tyrants?
(2) Will the secessionists expect the Commonwealth
to maintain the useful though unprofitable Great
Western express, which was one of the conditions
exacted by Westralia before entering the Federation?
(3) Will the secessionists guard the eastern border
from top to bottom to enforce the protection against
eastern dumping that the secessionists advocate?
(4) Further to 3, is Freetrade for the world and
Protection against the rest of Australia a logical
fiscal policy?
(5) Are there such brilliant statesmen in Westralia
that the secessionists should suggest that, with the
dissolution of the Federation, all political mismanage-
ment will automatically cease?
(6) Further to the respective arguments of Messrs.
Edmond and Brinkley, how can Westralia dodge its
creditors without sugar-coating the harsh word “re-
pudiation” ?
Secession is a symptom of bad times, but
no symptom constitutes a cure.—Yours, etc.,
Philip Masel.

An Open Slather for Strikers.
The Scullidores have never been notable
for courage, but in their handling of the last
seamen’s strike and the events which bub-
bled out of it they showed more than
their usual timidity. It was an utterly
foolish strike to begin with, and its folly
was recognised by the union officers, by
most of the members and by Federal
Ministers. The point at issue, so far as
there was any point at issue, was whether a
shipping ep. should be compelled to retain
in its service a man temporarily employed
during the sickness of a permanent em-
ployee. It was a silly point, yet the
Federal Government solemnly convened a
conference under the auspices of its Arbi-
tration Court—which the seamen don’t
recognise as an authority—to consider the
matter.
A simple way to stop such annoyances,
and one which it would be in the interests
of Labor Governments in particular to
adopt, is to keep out of squabbles that are
outside the law. So long as the principle
of submitting industrial disputes to arbitra-
tion is written into the law of this country,
strikes of any sort either are illegal or are
the result of refusing to submit to arbitra-
tion. If a strike is illegal, penalties should
be inflicted. If it is outside the law, the
parties should be left to fight it out between
themselves, with no governmental interven-
tion unless criminal actions require repres-
sion in the interests of civil peace.
As matters stand, any mischief-making
little foreigner can, as events have proved,
bulldoze a union into a silly strike and
suspend an essential national service,
secure in the knowledge that the Federal
authority will spend its days and nights
feebly imploring the employers not to end
the suspension by accepting non-union
labor. If it were known that such shindies
weren’t recognised at all by the Adminis-
tration at Canberra (which holds its man-
date solely on account of its devotion to
the principle of arbitration), and that a
union that didn’t recognise the Federal
Arbitration Cotirt was regarded as black
by the Federal authority, the manufacture
of idiotic strikes in important industries
would become an impracticable amusement
for imported pests. The attempt to mingle
the right to strike with the right to count
upon the Arbitration Court as the sympa-
thetic friend of strikers is irrational and
prevents a professedly arbitration-loving
Labor Government from doing the job it
was elected to do and which it is paid to
do—and that is to govern. A Labor Gov-
ernment that professes to love arbitration
and openly encourages strikes manifestly
can’t govern.

The Twilight of the Gods.
“Belisarius” : Too late, I’m afraid, for
"Gad” to bewail the fate of the “Gods of
Gallipoli” (B. 11/11/’3l). The lot of the
returned Australian soldier is one he shares
with every man of his trade who has gone
before him since the beginning of war,
which was the beginning of creation as we
are able to understand it, and it is one in
which every soldier coming after him seems
likely to share. Stand between the non-
militant section of the community and
danger and save it a.t personal risk to
yourself, and at once an inferiox-ity com-
plex is created—“ This cow did what I
wasn’t game to do, blast him!”—and the
inferiority complex opens up some strange
by-paths. Naturally the time comes when
the danger is over and the guardian angel’s
services are no longer necessary. Then the
suppressed bile boils up. In the words
of a Sydney magistrate, “All that is too
long ago to worry about,” and indifference
and neglect merge too often into positive
antipathy. I don’t suggest that the feeling
is general throughout the community, but
it is the rule with an element which bulks
very largely in the social and political life
of so many nations and of Australia in par-
ticular.

Wanted, Better Craftsmen.
Dear Bulletin, — To anyone connected
with the building trade, the decline in real
craftsmanship displayed by the various so-
called skilled trades in recent years has been
most marked and the appeal for better
trade unions (B. 4/11/’3l) is one which calls
for action before Australia gets back to real
building activity.
The development of the trade-union
movement into a political force has pro-
bably been responsible for the effacement
of many of the original aims and ideals
of the “craft guilds” of other times. No
qualifications are necessary to-day for an
applicant to receive his union ticket, a
fact which has lowered the standard of
skill in most of the building trades.
As an instance of the effect this ease in
joining a union has on skill, take the case
of Joe Mortar, who decides to become a
bricklayer. Joe joins the union and duly
lands a job as a brickie. He lasts two
or three days before the foreman dismisses
him for incompetency. With perhaps ten or
a dozen experiences such as this, Joe, being
an intelligent sort of chap, picks up enough
knowledge to carry him through on
“straight” work, and becomes a “compe-
tent tradesman” without bothering about
such things as a technical training or serv-
ing an apprenticeship. He finds no diffi-
culty in keeping pace with his fellow-
workers because award rates of pay have
been responsible for bringing the number of
bricks laid per day down to the rate of the
slowest worker—something less than half
what it was. Under the conditions, shoddy
work is hardly to be wondered at, and the
number of tradesmen capable of doing
specially designed and intricate work is
steadily growing less and less.
The politician’s gush that the “Australian
worker is the finest in the world” is an
aspiration more than a statement of fact;
and so long as unionism is in the toils of
politics will remain so. The modern trend
in architecture abroad, in its expression of
design by materials, requires a high stan-
dard of craftsmanship, and if Australia is
to develop any character in its buildings
the unions could do no better than tighten
up the qualifications for membership and
see that none but the competent got their
ticket.—Yours, Architect.
The Savings Banks.
The sub-committees of the Commonwealth
Bank and the N.S.W. Government Savings
Bank have drafted a plan for amalgama-
tion. Assuming that no other difficulties
arise success will depend largely upon the
attitude of the old depositors. The Bulle-
tin believed and still believes that the
Commonwealth Bank might safely have
made the whole of the deposits of the G.S.B.
available. But the risk was evidently thought
too great, and partly as a test “10 p.c. of
deposits, or £lO, whichever is the greater,”
will be made available as soon as the
arrangements have been finalised. This
means that the bank will be liable to be
called on to pay at once about seven mil-
lions; and it is very doubtful whether more
than that would have been called for had
the whole 56 millions of deposits been made
available. There are tens of thousands of
depositors who don’t want any of their
money—who, indeed, are still adding to
their deposits. On the other hand a few are
in desperate need of much more than 10 p.c.
of their balances. There is no need what-
ever to worry about the deposits once the
amalgamation has been completed: they
are literally as safe as Australia. Therefore
it is to be earnestly desired, in the inter-
ests of those who do greatly need their
money, that those who do not will leave
it with the bank. The more that is left
the greater will be the encouragement to
make the whole 100 p.c. available quickly.

The Babu and. His Neighbors.
“Ibn el Issab”: Writing as “A British
Woman” (B. 11/11/’3l) a Bulletin cor-
respondent complains of what she considers
harsh criticism of the Bengali babu and
unkind comparisons of the same person
with other races of India, notably the
people of Rajputana and the Sikhs. The
lady claims that the Bengali contributes
largely to the intellectual side of Indian
life and frequently is found in important
legal and administrative positions. Quot-
ing the case of the Bengali scientist Jagadis
Bose, she asks What the Sikh or other
nations of India have contributed to art
or science, literature being, presumably, in-
cluded with art.
It may be said at once that the opinion
of the babu expressed in The Bulletin
article is one endorsed by every race in
India outside Bengal. From Peshawur to
Mysore the “intellectual” individual from
the Eastern Province has for ages been
regarded as a doormat for him who would
wipe his feet, “To Bengal for loot and
women” is a Pathan proverb which has its
echo in the vocabularies of every virile
race in Hind. The Bengali is certainly a
person of considerable mental acuteness,
just as a rat is, and for much the same
reason—that he has had to develop in this
direction in order to maintain existence
against manlier peoples. As a verbal
casuist and accomplished splitter of hairs
he is naturally born to the British forms of
jurisprudence, to which he takes with such
avidity and in such numbers. But of initia-
tive and sense of responsibility he has no
glimmering. In administrative office and
on the Bench lie has never yet risen to in-
dependent heights. Always there is British
officialdom in the background to stiffen his
backbone—and to keep him straight.
Plausible and vocative to a degree, the
Bengali babu is the Indian above all others
who most easily impresses the superficial
visitor to India, and even the individual
who has resided there for some time yet
has never been able to get beneath the
surface of things—a not uncommon type.
The Rajput, the Pathan, the Sikh and their
kind do not go out of their way to be-
slobber the casual globe-trotter as does the
Bengali. They are only known to those
whom consider worth knowing.
As to science, the babu Jagadis Bose is
chiefly remarkable for his theories in con-
nection with the intelligence of plants,
theories which most scientists outside Ben-
gal scoff at. In literature, Bengal has pro-
duced the burblings of Rabindranath Tagore
for those that like that sort of thing, and
there is also a “Scott of Bengal” and a
“Milton of Bengal”; but the Bengali’s most
illuminating method of self-expression lies
in his press, both the vernacular and that
published in English, which is a revelation
of babu character. The outstanding Indian
writers in the . modern vein are not Ben-
galis but Marathis—members’ of a once-
warlike race. In verse l , narrative and
general literature, the works of men like
Hari Narayan Apte, Tilak and Iveshavasut
rank high on the list of modern Indian
writings, though they do not receive the
publicity which the Bengali characteristi-
cally secures for his wares. As to art, there
is nothing in Bengal to compare with the
magnificent architecture, Jain and Moslem,
of Rajputana, the United Provinces and
the Punjab, to confine oneself to Northern
India only. In these and other provinces
the applied arts of all descriptions tran-
scend anything produced by the Bengali,
who is, and has always been, more of a
huckster than a producer.
The query as to what the Sikhs, husband-
men first, but excelling in artcrafts, like
other inhabitants of the Punjab, have done
outside the pursuit of arms that is in any-
way noteworthy, may be answered by the
fact that they threw off the shackles of
caste in which the Hindu Bengali is still
enslaved, and founded a newer and cleaner
religion than the worship of the sacred
cow, with all its insanitary accompani-
ments. How tremendous an undertaking
that must have been even ladies with the
most elementary knowledge of India ought
to be able to realise.

POLITICAL
POINTS
With the assistance of the weak Governor,
Lang has placed another horde of Sydney
union secretaries and organisers, together
with two ladies, wives of “stalwarts” (women
have been eligible for appointment since
1926), in the Leg. Council. It was thought
that the weak Governor had referred the
matter to the Secretary for the Dominions,
but he denies having done so. “In making
appointments to the Leg. Council,” the
N.S.W. Year-Book says, “the Governor acts
ordinarily on the advice of the Ministry, and
no special instructions have been issued to

such advice.” There are now 110 Leg. Coun-
cillors, eight more than the total number in
Victoria (34), Westralia (30), S. Aus.

wealth. And every single one of the 677

ernment railways.
“Mr. John Beasley, who was a member of the
Scullin Government for some months, is attacking

Membership of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment is forbidden to “any person who is
under any acknowledgment of allegiance,
obedience or adherence to a foreign power.”
Similarly, “those in. allegiance to a foreign
power” may not sit in the N.S.W. Leg.
Council. In view of the “Soviet first”
admissions made by the Communists sen-
tenced in Canada, at least two new Leg.
Councillors with a revolutionary history
should be called upon to satisfy the House
that they are fully qualified.
In the measure which the Hogans (Vic.)
have substituted for the rejected Unemploy-
ment Relief Bill there is no mention of rates
of pay, but provision is made for allocating
the amount available for “works” among
government and semi-government bodies,
which are bound by industrial awards. Not-
ing that Burnett Gray and McLaclilan, the
Independents, were sympathetic and that
Toutcher and Maltby (Nats.) were inclined
to give the bill a fly, the Opposition let the
second reading go on the voices, but will pro-
pose drastic amendments in committee. And
then, of course, “another place” will have to
be reckoned with.
Townsville (N.Q.) railway men are on
strike in sympathy with three of their num-
ber who refused to handle a truck of “black”
ore from Cloncurry and were promptly dis-
missed. The malcontents could not have
chosen a worse time to demonstrate that the
caprice of some strike promoter means nwre
to them than loyalty to the State which
employs them. In spite of reductions, the
Queensland Railway Department is .still
heavily over-staffed and losing the familiar
million and a half a year, and a lot of the
absentees may find that their services are
no longer required when they flock back to
toil again.
Minister Blakeley has the pot boiling for
“a vigorous . publicity campaign to boost
the Federal capital as a holiday resort” at
Christmas-time. The State railway depart-
ments of N.S.W. and Victoria are to be
begged to furnish cheap trips along the
complicated track where hardly anybody
goes ; and there are to be a special, postage
stamp, a moving picture and 50,000 book-
lets. It might be worth while to blow tnc
dust off the deserted boarding-houses and
wake the ghosts at the railway station it
there were a prospect of the solitary flutter
leading to anything, but as an annual affair
it is unpromising. Live capitals go m tor
a daily or hourly flutter.
A suspicious character is heading this
way, and the immigration department
should be warned. J. H. Thomas, alter
announcing that the Dominions are to con-
centrate on supplying “primary products to
Great Britain and to get their manufactured
goods from it, has arranged a hurried Pro-
gress round the Empire (he is due at Can-
berra in February) with a view to taking
the Governments separately and chewing
each one’s ear individually. It should be
explained to Thomas that, though there are
some surviving fossils here who will shake
him by the hand, the community in general
has no use for his scheme.
The Lang plan is being dragged into the
N.S.W. municipal elections, along with a
grouping system designed to “dish the
Whigs” and the Federal A.L.P., which is
running a ticket. In one case the nomina-
tion of a Lang-plan candidate has been
refused because he “owes the council money,
and the rejected one is asking McGirr, the
Minister of Local Government, to declare
that he is entitled to “owe the council money
and be an alderman at the same time. It s
a wonder this gentleman wasn’t appointed
to the Leg. Council. To owe money, refuse
to pay and work up a hullabaloo about it-
why, the man is a living embodiment of the
Lang plan.
Queensland Government has offered to
extend the leases of pastoral areas and
grazing farms, 11,000,000 acres altogether,
where mortgagees are willing to reduce
interest rates to 6 per cent. The exten-
sions proposed range from 12 to 20 years,
and already a great howl is heard about
“locking up the pick of the pastoral coun-
try ” But in common justice something has
got to be done for sheepmen who, before
they had recovered from the severe drought
losses, saw the price of w T ool go below the
cost of production, and this when they had
to pay sky-high taxes on their income foi
the previous year.
Lang, as N.S.W. Treasurer, will collect
at least £159,039 from the estate of J. N.
Grace, the Sydney draper. Theodore’s share
will be £47,711 and odd shillings. The estate
was sworn at £636,156, and the State has
first cut, its duty being 25 p.c. on £lOO,OOO
and upwards; the Commonwealth _ takes
10 p.c. of the balance where (as in this
case) the property passes to “a widow,
children or grandchildren.” Interest at the
rate of 10 p.c. p.a. is charged on amount ot
duty unpaid six months after death.
When Hughes condescended to join with
the Liberals and capture their whole outfit
he appointed himself Prime Minister and
Pearce leader of the Senate, and found Minis-
terial jobs for Jensen, Poynton and Kns-
sell. Jensen was presently replaced by
Webster, and in time room was made for
Lamond, Laird Smith and Earle —ail
I-lughesliers, like the others mentioned.
Towards the end half the Ministers belonged
to the Hughes group. Nothing like that
is likely to happen in Britain. In Mac-
Donald’s Cabinet there are 11 Conservatives,
five Liberals and four Nat. Laborites.
Ministers not in the Cabinet include the
same number of Libs, and Labs, and 14
Conservatives. In other words, the Con-
servatives have done what the Australian
Libs, could and should have done —obtained
a dear majority in the Ministry without
compromising their party or their organisa-

If, as some people say, the world never
has enough money to buy more than about
three-fourths of what it produces, where
does the other one-fourth go ? When this
paper thinks of all the eggs that, all .the
fowls of the world have been producing since
the first fowl laid the first egg and the
one-fourth of every day s production that
couldn’t be bought, it begins to suspect that
even a hundred years’ surplus must make
a sizeable collection. W here is it. And
where are the collections of all the other
tilings in the world that the world hasn t
had money enough to purchase?

The Federal A.L.P. executive (Kcnneally’s
show) has cancelled the expulsion of S. Aus.
Senators Daly (one of Scullin’s Ministers)
and O’Halloran by the State A.L.P. execu-
tive and ordered Premier Hill and 22 other
State Labor members, who were expelled
along with Daly and O’Halloran, to carry
their appeal to the State A.L.P. Executive.
If that concern insists on keeping them out
they will be at liberty to ask Kenneally's
show again to let them in. Hill and his
22 say they will be blowed if they humble
themselves to “Communists in Labor cloth-
ing.” The State A.L.P. executive is expected
to say that it will be blowed if it lets Ken-
neally’s show whitewash Daly and O’Hal-
loran. It is a tangled situation and South
Aus., beset by other troubles, is getting a grin
out of it. There are now four Labor par-
ties in the State, each claiming to be the
genuine article, and three members of one of
the parties—Makin, Yates and Kneebone —
have been denouncing their “leader’s” policy.
Badly, the Minister of No-Labor, is the
clumsiest bluffer in Lang’s party. Over the
air the other night he had the gall to assert
that his Government has “given every indica-
tion of its sincere desire to assist the
employers to the limit of its capacity.” This
when Badly’s crowd is deliberately refusing
employers the right to apply to Pidding-
ton's Court for a reduction of the boom-
time basic wage—£4 2s. 6d. a week, with
child endowment added; when it has just
doubled the endowment tax, making it £2 in
the £lOO of wages and salaries ; and when it
did its darnedest to bring in an “emergency ’
income tax of ss. in the £, which, with the
ordinary Federal and State taxes and the
special Federal impost on property income
(10 p.c.), would have left employers with
2s. in the £. Nothing could be more ridicu-
lous than the spectacle of a dunce trying to
cram rubbish down the community’s throat.
Lang,, according to the paper of which
he is a director, has “given a great lead to
the nation,” having undertaken to provide
a whole £150,000 for “additional employ-
ment.” The £150,000 represents _ a trifle
more than a week’s relief-tax receipts, and
will furnish the out-of-works, whose num-
bers he .so carefully conceals (though the
Director of Labor Exchanges blurted out
that there were 130,000 at the end of
June), with about a day’s toil at union
rates —Badly, rebuking the Ashficld Coun-
cil, which proposed to pay relief workers
the basic wage, said they must all get union
rates. Moore, of Queensland, for his part, is
arranging to get an extra three days’ wages
in December for intermittent relief workers
(i.e.„ men employed part-time after putting-
in 12 weeks on regular relief jobs), and
an additional two days’ wages for girls
doing needlework and the like for the Social
Service League. But, then, Moore is only
a “Tory,” who has been operating for 15
months or so on a tax of 3d. in the £.
The Lang brand of M.P. has a reckless
fondness for big figures. At a revival meet-
ing at Moree, Federal-member Lazzarini said
that “the banks” had issued £2,030,000,00
of counterfeit money, which was a sweeping
indictment, and that they had also len
£267,000,000 to “primary and secondary
industries and the Government. 1
alleged crime of granting this accommoda-
tion made Lazzarini swell with rage anu
turn blue in the face. He urged the raising
of a loan of £100,000,000 for “reproductive
works.” Where the reproductive works aie
the gentleman didn't say.
One of the crosses a policeman has to
bear is the Laborite who, when told he is
obstructing the traffic, or something ot tne
sort, retorts “I’ll ’ave the coat ort yei
back fer that, me noble !” and straightway
hies him to his member with that end m
view. In a recent instance the complaint,
was taken from the station sergeant step
by step through the inspector and the Com-
missioner to the Chief Secretary, . ie
Minister for Justice and the Attorney-
General. It was a win all along the line tor
the John Hop, but that didn t make his
experience any the less harassing.
While Slang is chasing ’buses off the
streets of Sydney to make it less diffi-
cult to givtf Government railwaymen and
tramwaymen 48 hours’ pay for 44 hours
work, the City of Paris is also out with
the axe, but is applying it to trams. 4 rams,
it is complained, are increasingly causing
traffic blocks, and “the people are demanding
up-to-date transport in the shape of ’bus ser-
vices ” so 34 tramway lines have been torn
up and replaced by ’buses, while 11 more
are doomed. The French, being a logical
people, do exactly the reverse of what Lang
does.
“Farleigli”: James Edmond asserts (B.
7/10/’3l) that the thumping pro-Federation
majority in Westraiia was “urged on
its way by John Forrest.” It was precious
little urging that John did in comparison
with what was used on him, / if he had had
his own way he would never have sent the
bill to the people, but the threats of
separation on the goldfields combined w ith
pressure by the Imperial Government forced
his hand. Although in the end he declared
himself in favor of Federation, at the best
he was but an eleventh-hour convert, and
there were those who said that lie could
never bring himself to vote for it.
“Despairing of getting sufficient money from the
State lottery, the Sydney hospitals are appealing

“Feng-Shui” : Japan’s tactics in Manchuria
are following' precedent. Tokio is announced
to be deeply interested in a movement for
independence, sundry local generals having
declared their hatred of Chinese rule. All the
reports come from parts of the vast territory
which Japan, has occupied with troops.
Another piece of news of alleged significance
is the sudden disappearance from the foreign
settlement of Tientsin of Mr. Pu Yi. * Mr. I n
is the pseudonym of the ex-Emperor llsuau
Tung, who retired to Tientsin after the last
attempt to set him back on the throne failed
at Peking. Tokio newspapers hint darkly
of an intention on his part to assume the
imperial yellow at the old capital of Ins
clan, Mukden. From that to his restoration
under Japanese auspices as the Son of
Heaven at Peking is a big step, but not too
large for the imagination of the chauvinists
of Nippon, who have been talking of Man-
churia as merely a stepping-stone, to further
expansion in the Dutch East Indies' and the
South Seas. As a matter of fact, however,
Mr. Pu has another reason for wanting to
disappear in smoke. A concubine whom his
Majesty divorced for spitting in the
street and being rude to eunuchs lately
served him with a writ for 500,000 dollars
maintenance; and what is left of the im-
perial regalia would hardly come to a fifth
of that.

“H.S.”: At the Darlinghurst end of
Macleay-street the other night I came across
an act that couldn’t lie seen nowadays in
any white city outside Australia —or
Southern Europe. A kitten was crouching
against a wall, and keeping a brave face to
an Airedale, which was prowling uneasily
round on the look-out for a safe chance to
strike. As often as the dog stopped the
kitten moved forward a few inches and
feinted threateningly with its paw, where-
upon the Airedale again began to manoeuvre
for position. Looking on, in excited anti-
cipation of a kill, were the owner of the
dog and half a dozen men and women. I
remarked to the owner, a decently-dressed
middle-aged man, that the Aircdaie would
end by killing the cat. Much annoyed he
said that what his dog did was no business
of mine, and only put an end to the even-
ing’s sport when I pointed out that to stop
cat-baiting in public was everybody’s busi-
ness—including that of the police. If it had
happened in London he would probably have
collected a thrashing from the heftiest man
for woman) present, and if the cat had been
killed or maimed the crowd would have made
an ambulance case of him. The Totts
Pointers were obviously on the side of the
Airedale. It may be said that the average
Darlinghurst night-bird doesn't represent the
average decent Australian, but I have an
idea that the same thing would have hap-
pened in many other parts of Sydney. There
is justification for the overseas charge that
Australians are callous, but it isn't a
characteristic of the race, as some claim, nor,
as others say, a result of droughts which
cause animal life to be lightly regarded.
Lack of humanitarian propaganda is our
trouble. Brutality is rare among modern
Australian children; it has been educated
out of them in the State and public schools.

“Quack” : There was an extraordinary
case at Broken Hill the other day. A mob
of small children, boys and girls, from live
to eight, were running home from school.
One girl of under six called a boy ot
six and a bit “Dirty Face.” The boy chased
her, caught her, and gave her a hit on the
back. She was dead within a few minutes.
They couldn’t find any marks of violence;
the back wasn’t bruised ; the 6nly thing that,
looked like a mark was where she struck
the ground when she fell. She liadn t been
ill; she was quite well and apparently
normal at school and on the way home. A
post-mortem revealed nothing till they came
to the thymus, a gland at the back of the
neck. That was very greatly enlarged ; and
enlargement of the thymus may lead to
anything in a small child, especially it there
is a blow to help the evil work. At 13 or
thereabouts the enlargement generally disap-
pears. Moral: Don’t thump the child on
the back —even if she does call you "Dirty
Face.”

“X.S.”: A Melbourne citizen who was

be excused on the score that he was deaf.
When it was pointed out that he had been
a juryman on a previous occasion he
admitted the fact, but asserted that the
Judge refused to entertain liis story about
his affliction and obliged him to sit.. He
added that when it came to the verdict he
had refused to convict for the excellent
reason that he had not heard a word of the
evidence. At this artless disclosure the
Court hurriedly excused him from further
attendance. As he was the only one of

“M. de Paris” : The case of John Lee, the
Babbacombe (Devon) murderer, who was
reprieved because the drop refused duty
on his three visits to the scaffold, seems to
have been cleared up at last. Books have
been written about “The Man They Could
Not Hang,” and hundreds of thousands of
people were ready to regard the. mysterious
happening as the last-minute intervention
of Providence on behalf of an innocent man.
But a recent book of reminiscences by
Ernest Bowen-Rowlands, a well-known
criminal barrister, gives a much more feasible
explanation. His story is that an old lag,
confined in the same gaol as Lee, confessed
on his death-bed how he had done the
trick. An expert carpenter, he was detailed
to see that the gallows were, in perfect
working order. While doing this he slipped
in a small wedge which prevented the drop
from acting. When called in after the
first failure he removed the wedge and
showed that the apparatus was working
smoothly, and then replaced the wedge before
leaving. This dodge he repeated twice,
thereby saving the murderer’s life. Lee’s
sentence was commuted to imprisonment
for life, but he was released after serving
25 years.

“Old Q.”: Every week the Brisbane
“Courier” publishes a column of extracts
from its files of 50 years ago. One of them
appearing recently recalls a comedy of the
past. Charles Lilley, a leading barrister of
his day, professed Radical principles during
his Parliamentary career —there was then
no Labor party. He became Chief Justice of
Queensland, and was recommended for the
usual knighthood by the Government of the
day, which loathed his politics. Shrewdly
suspecting that his quondam opponents had
engineered the honor as a farewell bit of leg-
pulling, the new Chief attempted to decline
it, but found custom and convention too
strong for him ; Sir Charles he had to be.
He was far better known, however,, by
another title. In his Parliamentary days
he w r as answering questions at a political
meeting. “Mr. Lilley.” began a questioner.
“My friend,” replied Lilley—“Comrade”
was as yet unknown in this connection —
“don’t call me ‘Mister’; call me ‘Charley.’”
After that he was “CJall-me-Charley” Lilley
to the end.
“Birkrode” : I know a follow lias a darned

why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to
the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of

Peter says: “ ‘Why hast thou conceived this

“Farleigh”: “The size of the hailstones
was between marbles and nutmegs, some
being even larger.” Thus the “S. M. Herald”
introducing a new standard of comparison
into its account of a recent storm.
It seems a commendable innova-
tion although whether the average
nutmeg is larger or smaller than
the average marble is a nice
point. The old established jour-
nalese hallowed by the tradition
of a century or more was “hail-
stones as large as pigeons’ eggs. ’
Pigeons’ eggs seem to have been
an arbitrary selection like the
references in old-time cookery
books to “a piece of butter the
size of a walnut.” Either lacks
definiteness. There is a story of
a provincial reporter who wrote:
“The hailstones were large, vary-
ing in size from a shilling to
eighteenpence.” He might have
expressed himself more clearly, buf still lie
got out of the beaten rut.

“C.Q.”: The problem of fixing the open-

Remembrance so that at the eleventh hour
on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in
each year a ray from the sun will fall on
the floor of the inner chamber exactly above
the crypt occupied a group of astronomers
and engineers on last Armistice Day. The
sun performed his part and the calcula-
tions satisfactorily, but the question has
arisen as to whether the gradual changes in
the relative positions of the heavenly bodies
concerned will cause trouble in the future.
When the State Theatre was opened in
Melbourne it was announced that the stars
that twinkled in the imitation sky above
the auditorium exactly reproduced the posi-
tion of the real firmament on the night of
the premiere, but, owing to inexorable
natural laws, they are far from doing so
now. However, it will be 99 years before
the annual infinitesimal change in the inci-
dence of the ray of light that penetrates the
Shrine will require more than the slight-
est adjustment, and it will be 200 years
before a radical alteration will be necessary.

“Light Horse”: “Marsh” lias got a bit
mixed concerning that Turkish attack on the
Suez Canal (B. 18/11/’3l). The alleged
cock-crowing incident was supposed to have
taken place during the first Turkish attempt
on Egypt in 1915, when the invading troops
actually reached the canal, behind which the
British troops were entrenched. The Dueidar
incident “Marsh” refers to took place long
after that, but before the second Turkish
attack which ended so disastrously for Jacko
at Romani and Katia. Unsupported out-
posts of British Yeomanry at Ograhtina,
Hamisah and Katia, in the Sinai Desert,
some 40 miles from the canal, were mopped
up by a raiding party of camel-mounted
Turks and Austrian machine-gunners. The
raiders were beaten off at Dueidar, as
“Marsh” says, and the news of the raid
brought the* Anzae Mounted Division hot-
foot into Sinai from its rest-camps m

is' hard luck that the wary little beggat
was killed by the first shot fired m tin.

What do w T e lack of the things that count
for a blend that cheers and props,
A drink to brighten the darkest day, with
malt from a thousand crops,
And —good as ever in Kent were grown—
those prime Tasmanian hops?
Have we not brewers sage and skilled, and
spacious breweries
With all hands busy from dawn to dusk as
ever a hive of bees,
On vats and mash-tubs, barrels and casks,
and all such things as these?
Then here’s a health in the amber joy our
own fair land has nursed!
Pardie! but it does a fellow good to know
when he slakes his thirst,
As ever a .sturdy patriot should, he’s put-
ting Australia first.
And what of this tribute from places high,
you liquor lords and powers?
I’ll swear that it isn’t every day you get
such a bunch of flowers:
There’s never a beer in all the world .Toe
Daly ranks with ours.

“Verneuker”: A Melbourne suburban
housewife answered a knock on the front door,
to find two woebegone urchins on the mat, each
with a duckling under his arm. They ex-
plained that the birds had been bred by their
widowed mother who was so hard up that
she had sent them out to sell them. They
looked to be well-developed birds in prime
condition, and the lady clicked with the
deal. It was not until some days later, when
an indignant park official arrived with a
couple of John Hops in tow, that she real-
ised the “ducklings” were cygnets stolen
from the ornamental water in. Alexandra
Park.

“Sinik”: My car, whose innards arc as
much a mystery to me as my own, suddenly
lost power, so I took it to the nearest
garage. The boss, after a longish examina-
tion, delivered his finding. The tank was
choked. It would have to be taken off and
cleaned —a big job. As I couldn’t afford
the time I crawled to my destination, where
another mechanic happened on the real
trouble —a faulty plug. Some days later a
terrifying rattle developed. It recurred at
intervals, but never in the presence of
expert witnesses, as is the perverse way of
engines. Knowledgeable men with oil all over
them listened while the engine was idling,
and agreed that there was a knock. Some
said the engine would have to come down
ENLIGHTENING.
“I’m terribly in love with Jack. I’ve tried everything under the sun to make him
propose —and he won’t.”
“Ever thought of giving the moon a chance? ”
at a cost of £l5 or so, others that it didn’t
matter. “Carry on,” said the latter cheer-
fully. and told of ears that had been driven
thousands of miles with worse knocks. Days
passed before a mechanic discovered that a
gear-shaft w r as broken. These, and other
experiences of the kind, have satisfied me that
mechanics work in the dark. One of them re-
moves the tank to clean it. finds it doesn’t
need cleaning but that a spark plug does, and
charges for both jobs to save his face. Simi-
larly, a doctor operates for appendicitis before
he realises that he should have tapped for
pleurisy, and the patient, never knows, even
if he survives. Cars have advantages over
human bodies. One doesn’t, hear of the
gadgets on the dashboard of a car being torn
off to cure a choked carburetter. A friend
of mine had all his teeth yanked out. to
l’elieve his indigestion before the doctors
found he had a gastric ulcer.

“C. Coral”: Absence of shower baths is
not peculiar to the Mandated Territory (B.
2/9/’2l). In my own section of North
Queensland the man who requests a bath
at a country pub is generally conducted to a
bucket and tank, with an injunction to
“take care of the shower when you hoist
if—that pulley ain’t too safe!” Recently
a city-bred lady visitor, unaccustomed to
bush conditions, intimated to a maid at a
N.Q. pub that she would like her usual
hot bath. The girl thought the idea of a
hot bath in a climate like ours distinctly
humorous; but after running over the pos-
sibilities she said: “Well, missus, I
could bring a tub into your bedroom, but
are you a splasher , please? Because if you
arc ,' I’m afraid I can’t; this bedroom is
right over the billiard-room, and the holes
in the floor let the water run right on to
the table, and the sports ohjeck.”

“F.S.”: A quaint confidence trick was
played on an unsuspecting Presbytefian
minister of a Richmond ( Melb.) church.
Noticing a gentleman with his collar reversed
amongst the morning congregation the
worthv divine invited him to share a meal at
the manse. It transpired that the stranger
was passing through Melbourne on his way to
Sydney, and that he was temporarily out of
an ecclesiastical job. As he was obviously a
man of education and considerable eloquence
the Richmond incumbent invited him to take
the evening service. On the following Tues-
day the stranger turned up, borrowed some
money on the plea that supplies he was ex-
pecting had been held up by a bank in -Adel-
aide, disappeared and has not been heard ot
since. A.s the sermon he preached was tun
of spiritual grace the congregation were the
gainers, even if the parson not.
“D.G.” : An old man with the
stamp of army veteran abont him
was recently seen to march into
Sydney National Gallery, halt
before a portrait of General
Monash, stiffen to attention and
bring his hand to the salute.
Then he right-about-turned and
solemnly marched out, past an
avenue of masterpieces, without
a glance to right or left.

“X.S.”: A remarkable feature
about bomb-throwing in Mel-
bourne is that nobody ever gets
hit. Another obvious, thing is
that, whatever the motive for the
original crime or attempt at one,
the wave of violence which follows
it is more psychological than poli-
tical. Unbalanced morons or half-
wits read the report of the out-
rage in the papers and are filled
with a yearning to do something
similar. But the making or secur-
ing of a lethal weapon being a
difficult and dangerous job, they
rarely get beyond looking up the
’phone numbers of sundry emi-
nent citizens and giving their
wives sinister messages. After
the bomb was thrown on to
Stanley Argyle’s verandah
numerous "people got warning
letters in some of which there
was little attempt to hide tne
sender’s identity. The deadly uni-
formity of modern ilfe, with the
stimulus of vicarious violence of the movies,
has a lot to do with it.
* * * *
“Mells”: The exact amount of time (in
the police-court sense) that corresponds to
a monetary penalty seems to depend a good
deal on the taste and fancy of the magistrate.
“A pound or seven days”, probably repre-
sents the ordinary ratio fairly, although, as
money varies in value whereas time can
neither be inflated nor deflated, the flat rate
strikes one as inequitable. Anyway, there
arc perpetual variations. The other day in
Sydney a cocaine trafficker, who had been
fined £250 with the alternative of 500 days,
appealed to a higher court. The Judge con-
firmed the conviction, but reduced the penalty
by 96 per cent., making it £lO or 20 days.
It will be noted that ’Son ah maintained the
ratio —£1 in this case, equalling two days.
In another court on the very same day two
men convicted of having assaulted a police
constable were ordered to pay five shillings
or be imprisoned for five minutes —and doubt-
less “took it out.” The lightness of the
punishment was accounted for by the cop
having smitten back so shrewdly that, one
of his assailants woke up in hospital and
the other wasn’t in much better case. Still,
all these arbitrary values of sterling, trans-
lated into terms of incarceration, are con-
fusing.

“R. Volt”: The P.M.G. has convened a
wireless conference, which includes such
diverse interests as the Radio Association,
the Vic. Railways Department and the State
Electricity Commission, to consider the
growing anarchy in the upper regions. What
with squealing from ill-adjusted private sets,
induction from high-tension wires, starting
and stopping of electric-trams and -trains,
static and thunderstorms, Beethoven’s
Eroica symphony and Jack OTlagan’s latest
song hit have small chance of reaching the
ears of the millions without some unpre-
meditated effect being included. Even the
humble domestic iron and electric-radiator do
their bit in creating chaos. Since electrjc-
wiring is often unscientific and insulation
constantly tends to perish, induction is prac-
tically impossible to eliminate. The* only
feasible remedy is some method of screen-
ing the receivers themselves and this involves
expense, research and special knowledge.
It is proposed to divert some of the license-
fee money to investigation. The cable com-
panies have had generations of experience
of this sort of trouble. The cables, when
they are brought into the cities, are heavily
insulated and buried, but innumerable de-
vices have had to lie employed to screen
them from the leaky alternating current
and the tramdriver’s starting-handle. In
some cases it has been found necessary to
lay a return cable alongside the incoming
one and “earth” it miles out at sea. Cable
instruments are coarse and insensitive com-
pared to radio receivers, which tend to
become more and more susceptible to the
most delicate impulses wandering around in
THE NEW SECT.
“Will you be married in your church or his?”
“His, I suppose. He’s Presbyterian, but me—Pm wireless.”
the other. At the bottom of the trouble is
the fact that when an electric current is
started or stopped in a wire it induces a
current to flow in wires that lie parallel
with it, the strength of the current being
proportionate to the distance between the
circuits.

“Gotha”: The escapades of King .Carol
of Roumania and his kin (B. IS/11/’3l)
are a reminder that the Balkans have had
almost worse luck with their imported
dynasties than with their native-grown ones.
Carol 11., of course, is of Prussian stock, a
Holienzollern-Sigmaringen, and the only
one left of the ex-Kaiser’s clan who has. a
realm to rule to-day. Roumania made trial
of a home-grown prince or two when it was
in process of throwing off the Turkish yoke,
but they were voted unsatisfactory, and
Anally a German princeling, first Prince Carol
and later King Carol 1., was prevailed on to
accept the job. He arrived in 1860, and
proved a conscientious sovereign of sorts, but
he never managed to endear himself to his
subjects. A pro-German, he would have
dragged Roumania into the war on the side
of the Central Powers if he had been able.
This naturally made him more unpopular than
ever, and only his death in October, 1914,
saved him from deposition. Ferdinand, his
nephew, succeeded. He had married the
daughter of Australia’s old friend the Duke
of Edinburgh, and Carol 11. was the eldest
son. To that extent the present wayward
monarch might be held to have a dash of
English blood in him, but Edinburgh ceased
to be English when he succeeded to the
dukedom of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Any-
way the Prince of Wales and Carol are
second cousins.

“Strict Veg.”: A Brighton (Vic.) coun-
cillor, Mrs. Elizabeth Bleazby, who is the
late Premier Bent’s
daughter, avers that the
“beautiful modesty of
youth is dying fast owing
to the prevalence of
skimpy bathing costumes.’’
These, she explains, look
“very ugly worn by any
but the young and slender,”
and she makes an eloquent
plea for higher necklines and
a few more inches of leg
covering. When I lived
under the benevolent ad-
ministration of the Sultan
of Brunei precisely the
same objection was brought
against the bathing cos-
tumes worn by the girls of
liis dominions. The national
costume consisteu of a gar-
ment falling from the neck
to one inch above the
ankles, but, owing to the
decay of morals, females
began to parade the beaches
clad in nothing but brace-
lets arid waistbands of
hornbill feathers. Some of
them even removed the
bracelets. A petition,
signed by large numbers of
right-thinking people, was
presented to the Sultan,
pointing out that this cos-
tume had a most undesir-
able effect on the minds of
the children. His Majesty
summoned one of the peti-
tioners and one of the
girls before him and made
them both don the offending costume. He
found the costume not guilty.

“W.E.F.”: Every reported rich discov-
ery of ambergris is followed by a stream of
hopeful visitors to the Sydney Technological
Museum with parcels of various substances
which they have picked up. Almost invariably
the stuff turns out to be tallow, putty, soap,
paraffin wax or something of the sort. Most
of the finders accept the enlightenment philo-
sophically, though one irate and unconvinced
lady wanted to rub an officer’s nose in the
mess that she had brought along. An even
more violent exhibition of temper was given
by a swagman who dumped a .smelly lump
on the counter of an analyst's office and
demanded to be told its value ; he had found
it, he explained, on the banks of the Mur-
rumbidgee and had been assured it was
ambergris. When it was pointed out to him
that ambergris is a product formed in the
intestines of diseased whales, and that there
was no possibility of it travelling hundreds
of miles up rivers, he used profane language
and offered to fight the whole staff. Pro-
bably he had heard of “Murrumbidgee
whalers,” and the phrase had left some
confusion in his mind.

“F'aict Yeg.”: A future problem for Cres-
well O’Reilly is envisaged in one of the
brace of talkies released by Efftee Films
in Melbourne and Sydney. A motorist
gives vent to deep emotion by framing with
his lips the words “You !” The inter-
pretation presented no difficulty to the audi-
ence, which roared with laughter. The bad
diction of American actors has made every
movie patron a lip-reader, and I foresee
whole plays in which dialogue which verges
on the censorable will be delivered by this
sort of labial pantomime.

“Morita” : Of only one Armistice ceremony
do I cherish memories (B. 18/11/'MI) ;
that was the real one, away from noliticians,
brass-hats and flag-flappers, a few miles
behind Fritz in his mad rush for the Rhine.
Parked front to back along every road out
of the ruined and desolate village were the
old London double-decker lorries in which
we were to chase Fritz if he didn’t throw
up the sponge. For years we’d wondered
how the end of the fighting would come, and
vowed every estaminet would run dry that
day; but there couldn’t have been less fuss.
The nearest civilians and vin blaric were
miles away. When the official news came

through, a whistle called the fall-in, and
the C.O. informed us casually the job was
finished. Breathless silence for a few seconds
as men tried to realise it, then a roar of
“Thank Gawd fer that !”■ from an old-timer.
But from one section on parade, all in it
strangers to us, came loud and fervent cheer-
ing—they were reinforcements who’d been
taken on the strength only an hour before.

Up Martin-place there daily go
Crowds with the necessary dough;
They do not seem to greatly care
About the floral beauties there
So deftly ranged on stalls a-row,
Nor is their goal a talkie show.
Their bunce is not to blew or blow
On any adventitious snare
Up Martin-place.
They seek a certain portico,
A shrine where lucky marbles grow,
And thither daily they repair
From pretty nearly ev’rywhere
For what blind Fortune may bestow
Up Martin-place.
Up Martin-place they overflow
And surge along, content to know
A single dollar and a thrum
May open up Elysium,
As it’s accounted here below.
They storm the magical bureau
The enterprise of Lang and co.
Has opened with a cheerful hum
Up Martin-place.
The quid’’s but five-and-three; the quo —
To think of that sets hearts aglow:
Five thousand is a goodly sum!
And so the sanguine go and come
At Whiddon’s joint to risk a throw

Judge Lukin was faced in Vic. Bankruptcy
Court the other day by a practitioner whom
he could not remember ever having seen
before. It was Joseph Sabelberg, the oldest
practising solicitor in the Commonwealth; he
was admitted in 1868.
The first thing Ivingsford Smith did when
he returned to Melbourne was to get a
doctor to search his anatomy for traces of
carbon monoxide that might, or might not,
h ive been absorbed into his system from his
exhaust-pipe when he was flying over Turk-
ish territory on his recent dash to Eng-
land. On the diagnosis rested his hopes
of breaking any more world records, since
the London doctors told him his Sudden
collapse into Abdul’s clutches was due to
the nervous strain that dogs the dreams-of
long-distance fliers. The Melbourne specialist
declared for the deadly chemical, and the
great pilot now talks of another attack on
the Australia-England record, on his way to
his new job in the Cold Land. This is to
head a flying circus which is to tour the
British Isles, doing stunts and carrying pas-
sengers.
Admiral Sir Guy Gaunt, now re-visiting
Australia, is one of three brothers born at
Melbourne in the ’sixties who have won
distinction in the services. The father, Wil-
liam Gaunt, came from Staffordshire to be
a Victorian goldfields commissioner, and
later a Judge. Guy served in many parts
of the world, retired after the Great War
with a C. 8., and sat in the House of Com-
mons for several years. Sir Ernest Gaunt,
four years his senior, was Rear-Admiral of
the Ist Battle Squadron at Jutland and
later Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies.
The eldest brother, Cecil, rose to be a lieut-
enant-colonel in the Dragoon Guards ; he was
wounded in the siege of Ladysmith and col-
lected a D.S.O. in Mesopotamia in the Great
War. Mary Gaunt, the author, is a sister.
H. B. Sevier, new president of the asso-
ciated Chambers of Manufactures —he has
been N.S.W. president for a year past- —has
this advantage over most Australian Free-
trade politicians; he knows the strength of
foreign competition. like practically every
other American business man who has made
his home in Australia, he is an enthusiastic
Protectionist, because he knows how impos-
sible it would be for an unassisted Aus-
tralian industry to get a footing if a foreign

competitor—one of the sort he grew up
among—decided that it would like to keep
this market for itself. Mr. Sevier’s own line
is paints—he is head of Berger’s. One of
his early tilts was at Harry Gullett, descen-
dant of a generation of Freetrade advocates.
Between these little adventures he is join-
ing heartily in the Primiuister’s “Brighter
Business” campaign.
William James Affleck, president of the
Royal National Association, which conducts
Brisbane’s annual Show, was born at War-
wick (Q.) 63 years ago. He began to drive
a quill in the Brisbane office of the National
Mutual Life Assoc, when a youth, and at 25
was running that company’s northern branch
at Townsville,, where he soon became one of
the town’s live-wires. He returned to Bris-
bane at the beginning of the century to
become State inspector for his office. Some
years later he was appointed manager, which
position he still holds. He found sufficient
spare time to build up the Royal National
Assoc., and became an early member of
the council. He is keenly interested in dairy-
cattle improvement, and it was largely through
his untiring labors that the entries in this
department have been bigger and better
every year. Affleck has practically made the
milking-test department what it is to-day.
Jersey and Ayrshire breeders know him as
an ardent champion. His election to the
presidency last year was a popular one.

Adelaide, is to be the next. Sydney and
C. R. J. GLOVER,
new Lud Mayor of
Adelaide.
Melbourne achieved
Lord Mayors in
1902; Adelaide had
to wait another 17
years, and the tag
came just when
Glover was quit-
ting office. There
was no fight for
his seat even with
the new tinsel on
it; there hasn’t
been a fight over
the Adelaide
mayoralty for 16
years. Anyway,
not in the open.
Lieut.-Col Harry
Downes, command-
ing the 48th Bat-
talion of the Citi-
zen Forces in S.
Aus., wrote an
affectionate obitu-
ary notice of his
colleague and war-
comrade Captain
D. A. Twining for
the R.S.L. paper
“Reveille” ; before
the next issue he
was dead himself.
Twining was Ad-
jutant of the 48th
Battalion in
France, and
Downes was his
assistant; and both
before and after
the war they were
close friends and
associates. Twin-
ing was found dead
in his chair in his
office at the Barracks and Downes died as
suddenly.
Melbourne has acquired a picturesque
addition to its population in the Right Rev.
Archimandrite Antonius, imported by the
local Russian community, which has sorely
missed a pastor who could speak Russian,
to function as head of the local Eastern
Orthodox Church. A Syrian from Beirut, the;
Right Rev. Antonius spent many years in
Russia under both the Czarist and Bolshe-
vist regimes.
W. M. Hamlet was one of the last of the
N.S.W. public-service heads who were heads
in Henry Parkes’s day. He was appointed
Government Analyst in ’B7; he just missed
serving under old John Robertson. One of
his early jobs was to inquire into an out-
break of typhoid at Broken Hill, then boom-
ing. During his long reign as Government
Analyst he gave evidence in hundreds of
cases, and what he had said he had said,
and that was the end of it. Sixteen years
ago he retired, being then 65, and spent the
rest of his days exploring the Blue Moun-
tains. He was a great walker.
The first man married in the Broken Hill
R.C. Cathedral was a young constable named
Desmond. The young constable is a more
than middle-aged sergeant now; and the
other day his son was the first priest to be
ordained in the same cathedral.
“G.D.M.”: Portland (Vic.) is keeping its
centenary up next year. The other day I
walked into the office of the aged “Portland
Guardian,” born in 1842. O. G. Pettit, the
owner, mentioned that his paper was now the
oldest in ATctoria, and that his father, F. A.
Pettit, ran it for 30 years before him, along
with a number of other country journals.
Squadron-Leader A. 11. Cobby, D. 5.0.,
D.F.C., the new director of operations and
intelligence in the R.A.A.F., has hardly
enough room on his chest to carry all his
decorations simultaneously. He is credited
with the destruction of 24 German ’planes
and emerged on top in a dfozen other
encounters. One of his achievements was to
bring down two of the machines of Rich-
thofen’s circus.
The Sultan of Johore, a cable from Singa-
pore tells, has taken another mate, a beauti-
ful Scottish blonde of 40. widow of a doctor
who practised in the Straits Settlements.
The Sultan, who is 58, visited Australia in
1903, where he was received with more
curiosity than enthusiasm, his arrival hav-
ing been preceded by a story that he wore
diamonds in his teeth and was addicted to
other amiable eccentricities. Thirteen years
before that, when he was a Crown Prince
and still in his teens, he took a trip to
Loudon, which subsequently involved him in
a breach-of-promise suit. His present con-
sort, it is mentioned, adopts her husband’s
religion and becomes Sultana over a realm
of 350,000 Malays and Chinese.
Senator Hal Colebatch, who was the
speaker of the evening at the Master
Printers’ dinner in Sydney last week, lias
had a lifelong connection with the press. He
started as a reporter in Broken Hill in his
’teens; in Westralia he was a mining jour-
nalist, a prominent figure in 'the Parlia-
mentary press gallery, a leader-writer, and
editor for a time of the Perth “Morning
Herald,” which ran for a dozen years against
the “West Australian” until its untimely
demise in 1909. Then he purchased the
“Northam Advertiser,” about the oldest-
established country paper in the State,
which a son now owns, and started out for
himself, beginning his Parliamentary career
a little later. Always a lucid and cogent
writer, Colebatch rather surprised his old
press colleagues by showing himself every bit
as effective as a speaker —the conjunction
is rather rare —and he has improved
with the years. Whatever the subject, his
public addresses are always carefully pre-
pared and happily phrased.
Archie Price, Master of Adelaide’s first
University College, has switched from
schoolmaster and historian to political pro-
pagandist and pamphleteer. From St.
Peter’s College, Adelaide, he went to Mag-
dalen, Oxford. “The Foundation and Settle-
ment of South Australia,” published seven
years ago, brought him an F.R.G.S. This
was followed by two other similar works,
after which Price appeared in a new role
with a pamphlet entitled “The Menace of
Inflation,” which pushed him into the job
of chairman of the Emergency Committee,
a political organisation. Since then he
has toured the State as an active supporter
of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament.
His latest publication is “The Progress of
Communism.”
Robert Emerson Curtis, who has pub-
lished an excellent portfolio of lithographs
of the Sydney Harbor Bridge, is an English-
man who spent some of his early years in
Chile. When he was 15 his parents brought
him to Queensland, and after a few years
on the land he became a freelance artist in
Brisbane. America called again, and he
worked his way from ’Frisco to Chicago,
always keeping up his art studies. At
Chicago he was commissioned to draw a
series of industrial and building achievements,
ranging from the great Gary steelmills to
the “Tribune” tower on Michigan Boulevard.
He plied his litho. chalk all over the States
and Canada; on his return to this country
the first sight of the Sydney Harbor Bridge
inspired him to fresh effort, and his just-
published work conveys something of the
beauty and dramatic quality of the great
bridge.
James Alexander Young, Health Minis-
ter of Maoriland, is one of the three non-
farming members of the National Cabinet,
and one of the very few Liberals who have
managed in the last quarter of a century to
get returned by a north-of-Auckland con-
stituency. He represents Hamilton, centre
of a great dairying district, and is by pro-
fession a dentist. He got into Parliament in
1911. after a long apprenticeship on local
bodies. Shrewd and tactful, he served as
J. A. YOUNG, M.L. Minister for Health.
Chairman of Committees and for a great
many years as chairman of the Native
Affairs Committee, which isn’t such a simple
job as it sounds. In present reduced circum-
stances his job is to keep the Health Depart-
ment from spending more than it is
compelled to, and this nasty task is being
performed by him with surprisingly little
friction.
General-manager Davidson, jof the Bank of
N. S. Wales, threw his bombshell the other
day when he announced that there was so
much Australian money offering in London
that the private banks couldn’t any longer
afford to pay £l3O per £lOO of it, and if
the squatters and farmers wanted to pocket
the fine exchange they have been drawing
lately they must bring pressure to bear on
the Commonwealth Bank —it alone could
save the situation. Then the pressure
started ; every squatter’s and farmer’s spokes-

Federal Government to help in persuading
the Bank to “stabilise exchange.” F. 11.
Tout and Norman Kater have been chief
N.S.W. spokesmen for the graziers; and
“Paddy” Grant, president of the N.S.W.
Primary Producers, has broken his long
silence to plead for the smaller men. The
bank, of course, hasn’t replied; the official
view is said to be that what is asked for is
inflation, and that the bank disapproves of
inflation no matter what disguise it takes.
For the last six years Paddy Cahill, Com-
missioner Clapp’s peak-traffic specialist, has
looked after the railway passenger traffic to
the Melbourne Cup and the Royal Show.
Cahill started railroading as a porter in
1900 and has been a stationmaster for IS
years. He controlled railway affairs at
Portland when the first wheat was shipped
from that neglected port, and he has taught
the rudiments of station work to hundreds

in England, at 65, is reported, will be recalled
by many Australians who saw him on
Gallipoli and in Egypt, if only for his
Oft. Gin. of stature. He started his army
life as a gentleman ranker in the 7th Dragoon
Guards, which his dad then commanded. The
queer arrangement seems to have worked all
right, for he got his commission a couple of
years later. On Gallipoli he commanded the
2nd Mounted Division, a Yeomanry body,
and, returning to Egypt, he took charge of
the campaign against the followers of the
Senussi, in which a composite regiment of
Australian Light Horse served under him.
John Gordon 1 Gotch, of Gordon and Gotch,
who died at St. Kilda, Vic., last month, left
£33,000 (gross) to relatives, friends, chari-
ties and churches (Presbyterian, Congrega-
tional and Methodist).
Passed out at Townsville, at 95, Herbert
Mackay, first District-Surveyor of North
Queensland. A resident for 45 years in that
frequently maligned climate, he retained all
his faculties to the last, and leaves three
generations of descendants, all North Queens-
landers.
Mrs. Eliza Strong, who was laid to rest in
Melbourne General Cemetery last week, was
the widow of Alderman William Strong.
Mayor of Melbourne from 1885 to 1887. In
her long-ago term as Mayoress she took a
special interest in good works and charitable
institutions, notably the Austin Hospital for
Incurables and the Infectious Diseases Hos-
pital, Fairfield. One of her sons is a
Collins-street doctor.

At Oct. 31 this holding concern had
£2,169,492 invested in a string of subsi-
diaries, which are in the jam, fruit-canning
and preserving business. They are scattered
all over the Commonwealth and Maoriland,
and extend to England and S. Africa as
well. But the curtain is kept drawn over
the operating cos.’ figures, so outsiders know
little of the real position.
Still, the pups have been an energetic
and, as a whole, a profitable lot. To
help finance the growth of the various under-
takings. including the purchase of the Stan-
more Preserving Cos., Sydney, of the Gov-
ernment canning factory in Queensland, of
Kirkpatrick and Cos., Maoriland, and the
erection of additional factories in the
Dominion and S, Africa, the holding co.
gathered £365,881 of fresh capital during
the decade to the close of accounts in 192!).
Meanwhile the div., which had been lifted
from 121 p.c. to 13f p.c., dropped back to
10 p.c., following the distribution of £455,492
of bonus scrip (one for two). The gift,
which was provided Irom inner reserves,
raised capital to the present £1,430,173.
Then the slump and unequal competition
from Government subsidised factories in
N. S. Wales and Vic., which are run at a
loss, caused a .sharp contraction in earn-
ings, as the following figures show: —
1927. 1929. 1930. 1931.
Net income:—
Australian. . £123,898 £115,818 £71,481 £55,674
Other sources 35,205 44,819 46,866 35,880
Total .. £159,103 £160,637 £118,347 £91,554
Thus, last year there was a further slip of
£15,807 in the net return from the co.’s
local investments, making the drop 51.9 p.c.
over the last two years ; income from abroad
was £10,986 lighter, or 20 p.c. short of the
1929 figure. The profit claimed from all
sources was 6.4 p.c. on capital as against
8.3, 11.3 and 11 p.c. for the three pre-
ceding years, so the div. was lowered to
6] p.c. But the bonus issue, already
referred to, makes 61 p.c. worth 9.3 p.c. on
old holdings.
A year ago, when it became unprofitable
to export fruit, there was a glut in the local
market. In an effort to relieve the pres-
sure, State-financed factories were selling
their outputs at less than cost; but the
spring in exchange eased the position, though
how long it will take the industry to re-
adjust itself on a sound basis remains to
be seen. Meanwhile, returns from this hold-
ing co.’s Australian investments are likely
to be less profitable than of recent years,
and taxation, including the 10 p.c. super
tax, will make itself felt.
The co. is blessed with a cautious and
able management, and bids for the scrip,
which has always been popular on the
market, advanced briskly from 18s. lid.
early in September to 265. 9d. last week-
end, At the higher figure the return is
4.6 p.c. on a 6| p.c. div. basis, or 6 p.c.
should the div. be lifted to S p.c.
General Motors-Holdens, Ltd.
Seeing trouble ahead General Motors
(Aust.) Pty., which set up here in 1926 to
assemble and distribute the products of its
American parent, and Holdens, the highly
efficient motor-body builders of Adelaide,
decided to got into double harness. In
March last the present co. was formed and
took over the two businesses on a valuation
basis as from June 30, 1930. It paid
£1.111,600 for Holdens’ assets, and that was
£740,000-odd less than their book value.
Then Holdens’ £550,000 of pref. capital was
returned in cash ; the 624,000 ords were con-
verted (9 for 10) into 6 p.c. cum. prefs.
in tho new co., whose paid capital became
£1,527,400 in 561,600 prefs. and 965,800 ords.
at June 30 last. At the moment all the ords.
are held by the American parent, but four
of Holdens’ directors were invited to join
the new board (their pref. holdings are to be
converted into ords.), and E. W. Holden
became managing director.
Both sections of the business had been
highly prosperous, and each had laid its
plans on a mass-production basis. But the
slump caused such a sudden and complete
collapse of the motor-trade that, though
drastic action was promptly taken, it was
impossible to escape big losses. The follow-
ing figures, showing unit sales in each sec-
tion of the business, help to explain the
reason why:—

The car-selling section has been hit hardest.
Caught with large stocks on a falling market,
General Motors (Aust.) Pty. registered a
loss of £221,062 and Holdens a loss of
£49,930 for approximately, eight months to
the end of February, after providing for
contingencies.
Following the merger, the fixed assets
were written down ,by £542,793 (plant,
£356,790; freehold, £129,728; leasehold,
£56,275). Car assembly jobs having been
reduced from five to one, the staff was
shortened by over 75 p.c., cuts up to 40 p.c.
were made in salaries, including directors’
fees, and operating costs were lowered by
more than 39 p.c. Still, the spring in ex-
change, tariff adjustments and the persistent
fall in prices made further losses inevit-
able. After striking £232,979 off the
book value of stocks, the total loss for
the 12 months to June was £516,474. But
remaining accumulations, piled up _ during
the boom years, almost covered this hrige
loss, and the co. starts the current term with
all but £543 of its capital intact.
Most of the £617,993 coming to creditors
at June 30 was on acount of chassis sup-
plied by the parent, not to be paid for until
sold. Stocks figured at £779,724; book debts,
etc., £92,684; Commonwealth bonds, £25,000 ;
casli, £157,519. Thus there was no cause for
anxiety about the finances, despite the loss.
Fixed assets totalled £1,104,181 —plant,
£496,654; freeholds, £527,198; leaseholds,
£80,329.
Surplus stocks are expected to be cleared
by February next; but only moderate turn-
over is anticipated for the next few years.
It is impossible, therefore, to say exactly
when the co. will be trading on a profitable
basis again. Orders for only 250 bodies are
in hand, which is but one day’s output for
the plant at full capacity.
The prefs., whose div. is now nearly 12
months in arrears, are priced around 10s. on
the market. They were covered by net tan-
gibles with a book value of £2 14s. 4d. at
June 30.

A couple of years ago this old-established
Bourke-street retailer of high-class soft-
goods imported 80 p.c. of its merchandise ;
now it buys 70 p.c. in Australia and imports
the other 30 p.c. The tariff, exchange and
landing charges have added from 117 p.c. to
299 p.c. to the invoice prices of imported
dress-goods, to quote one group. The period
covered by the latest accounts was one of
falling prices, and many of these imported
lines, ordered some distance ahead, had to
be marketed at less than landed cost.
Despite savings of £30,000 in exes.,
the year’s trading resulted in a net loss of
£24,622. That was after taking stocks into
the sheet at £55,561 below the 1930 figure;
and it was the first thing of its kind the
co. has experienced since the collapse of
trade which followed the bank crashes of the
early ’nineties. Half-way through the term
the position looked good enough to hand the
ords. 24 p.c. To do this and pay the pref.
div. reserves were tapped for £43,223, reduc-
ing them to £61,652 in excess of goodwill
(£60,741) at July 24.
During the decade to the close of accounts
in 1930, turnover expanded rapidly and
splendid results were won. The ords.
averaged 13.1 p.c., sweetened with £133,211
of bonus scrip; extensions to premises and
plant added £295,217 net to the book value
of fixed assets, while the growth in the
outside debt was £93,092 -surplus earnings
provided the difference. But those perfor-
mances were achieved under boom eondi-
lions, and repetition need not be looked for,
However, the number of customers served
last year was only slightly less than in
the previous term, the fall in prices has been
checked, and the change over to mostly Aus-
tralian goods should narrow the opportunity
of price fluctuations, which may arise from
unsteady exchanges and other causes, to
play havoc with profits. I he market
anticipates an early re-emergence of satis-
factory earnings, and prices the pound ords.

At the close of last accounts the outside debt
consisted of £118,400 on mortgage, £122,392
of deposits, mostly from shareholders and
the staff, and £20,153 coming to trade
creditors. The more or less liquid surplus
(£63,704, including stocks) was £54,890
lighter than at the previous balance. Stocks
are claimed to be conservatively valued, and
much depends upon that.

(Guaranteed to Picture Investments Pty., Ltd.
This is tho co. in which Williamsons and
Hoyts merged their picture interests in
1926. It has done no good for itself. It
paid liberally for goodwill, assessed on the
basis of boom conditions, and, in tlic struggle
for supremacy with Union, went heavily
into debt, investing the proceeds in assets
whose earning power soon contracted severely.
As serious trouble threatened, early in the
last term the co. linked up with the Fox
Film Corporation, U.S.A., which bought
enough of the scrip to ensure control. Thus
has the co. secured the financial backing
necessary to relieve some of the pressure of
the outside debt, and gained other advantages
as well.
Still, events have compelled curtailment
of expenditure on amusements, theatre
admission-prices have been reduced, special
taxation has been imposed, and, of course,
the fixed charges pressed heavily upon the
attenuated earnings. Thus operations for
the first-half of the last term resulted in a
loss of £10,631; this was followed by a
profit of £14,972 for the second half, mainly
the result of reduced charges for film hire
and other economies. The £4341 netted for
the year was not enough to cover specially
guaranteed divs., so the A and B prefs.
were chalked up, and it may be a while before
the slate is cleaned.
Further, £44,392 of the paper reserves
were used up, largely to wipe out charges
capitalised in connection with new tneatres
during previous periods, thus reducing the
nominal lay-by to £93,017 at June 30.
Against that was the co.’s own goodwill of
£678,770. shown separately for the first time.
But, taking the subsidiaries’ figures into the
reckoning, no’ less than £1,338,508 of the
£2,616,723 of shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined) was represented by
intangibles when the books closed.
Here is the position so far as the parent’s
balance-sheet figures disclose it:—

Last . year £175,334 was raised on loan
account, mainly from Fox Film and others
in the group. This and the reduction of
£150.658 in debtors’ balances, etc., enabled
the board to lighten the amount coming to
trade creditors (now £115,919) by £206,346,
clip £65,572 off the overdraft and £13,750
off mortgages, etc. Altogether the excess, of
outside liabilities over more or less liquids,
excluding shares, increased by £40,324, reach-

slackness, of course. Also, further cuts
were made in the price of the co.’s finished
goods, and legislation and other things
lightened returns from investments. Still,
these returns were of great assistance in
augmenting the year’s profits, the chairman
says. After paying all trading exes., pro-
viding for larger risks, heavier taxation and
depreciation of plant and investments, the
board figured the year’s net result at 10.8
p.c. on capital as against 15.4, 27.4, 27 and
24.3 p.c. back to 1927. So the shilling bonus,
sent out in each of the three preceding terms,
was dropped, leaving the div. at 10 p.c.; and
10 p.c. is w 7 orth a lot more to old holders,
two-thirds of the £149.500 of capital having
been provided out of surplus earnings over
the last 15 years.
The depreciation of investments, due
partly to the National Debt Conversion and
interest reduction legislation, has been cared
for by adjustments from reserves and “other
sources,” thus bringing book figures more into
line with actual values. The year’s net reduc-
tion in book debts, cash and investments,
mainly investments (they are all lumped
in one entry in the sheet) was £27,574.
Visible reserves were tapped for a clear
£5009; most of the difference is accounted
for by the purchase of Keep Macpherson’s
Sussex-street freehold. This added £20,561
net to the book value of Fielding’s premises ;
the co. picked up some of its old freeholds
for £l2 15s. a foot in pre-war days.
Here is the position so far as the published
accounts reflect it:—•
1 Q 1 Q IQ9Q iQOfl TQQI
Paid capital.. £40,000 £149,500 £149,500 £149,500
Liabilities . . 51,982 17,569 17,531 13,622

Book debts, cash
and investments 19,778 183,014 185,119 157,545
Thus the more or less liquid surplus
(£166,892. including stocks and investments)
was £27,130 lighter than at the close of
accounts in 1930. Finances, however, are
obviously comfortable, and the plant is up-
to-date and well cared for.
It can be taken for granted that the co.
will get its full share of whatever business
is offering. The current year’s results will
partly depend upon the extent to which trade
revives, and partly upon the return obtained
from investments. In both these respects
the outlook is brighter than it was a few
months ago, though whether anything better
than 10 p.c. need be looked for for a while is
doubtful.
The pound shares, which were at 295. in
the market early in September, now fetch
345. At this higher figure the return is
5.8 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The backing
is 345. 3d. in net tangibles.
Australian Pines and Products, Ltd.
This is another forestry venture. A
Sydney syndicate, headed by T. C. Mc-
Intyre, formerly of the Paper and Pulp iCo.
of Australia, Ltd., bought about 4000 acres
of land suitable for growing pine-trees on
Myall River, Port Stephens (N.S.W.). The
syndicate is now floating this co. to take
over the property and sell it in acre lots.
Nominal capital is £IOO,OOO in 21,000
founders’ shares of 4s. each and 95,800 £1
shares. Of the latter 20,000 are offered; the
vendor takes £4200 in founders’ shares, but
no cash, for transfer of the property, on
which £2750 is still owing, the last of it
due May 31, 1937. The founders’ shares
rank equally with the ords. for divs. and
any surplus on liquidation, and carry two
votes per share on all matters except the
adoption of the balance-sheet, election of
directors and auditors and declaration of
divs.
About 500 acres will be required for fire-
breaks, reserve plantings, etc.; thus the cost
of the saleable area (3500 acres) is put
at 38s. lOd. per acre lot. These lots are
offered to the public at £32 10s. apiece. The
prospectus puts the cost of planting, main-
tenance, etc., at £l3 65.; selling and adminis-
tration. £7 Bs. 4d.; contingencies, £3; thus
leaving a net profit of £6 16s. lOd. per acre,
subject to taxation. On estimated sales of
520 acres per annum, that means a profit of
£3557, equal to 25.4 p.c. on a paid capital of
£14,000, which the promoters consider wall
be adequate. Should the allowance for con-
tingencies prove to be wholly in excess of
requirements, the estimated profit would be
36.5 p.c. on capital. AVhile the public is con-
tent to pay £32 10s. an acre for this class
of long-term speculation, so long wall the
shareholders in these so-called forestry cos.
continue to gather rich harvests.
Now l let us briefly consider the proposi-
tion from the point of view of the pur-
chaser of an acre lot, whose position differs
vastly from that of a shareholder. In-
cidentally, the co. does not sell bonds, and
has not therefore appointed a trusteee to
look after the interests of bondholders, but
apart from that it has followed the prin-
ciples of the bond-selling method of finance.
It enters into a straightout contract with
each purchaser for the sale of a specified
piece of land at the price already stated.
This agreement provides, amongst other
things, that the co. shall (1) plant each
acre sold with not less than 600 conifers
within 12 months of the contract being
signed ; (2) care for the trees until maturity ;
(3) harvest the timber and control the con-
version, marketing and sale of the products.
It may at its own expense put up plant for
the manufacture of wood pulp, paper or
other wood derivatives, but it is under no
obligation to do so.
The proceeds of the sale of products har-
vested in any one year shall constitute a
pool for that year, and purchasers of the
land from which the harvest has been
gathered will receive one pool certificate for
each acre. Out of the pool will first be
paid the costs of harvesting, manufacture
and disposal of the produce. Then the co.
shall be entitled to deduct £l2 10s. per
acre for its own use to cover the cost of
replanting, care and maintenance, etc., thus
ensuring that its job continues on a pre-
payment basis. Out of the remaining net
proceeds, if any, the co. takes 20 p.c., the
remaining 80 p.c. being distributed rate-
ably amongst the registered holders of pool
certificates. The prospectus estimates the net
return to the investor at £250 per acre.
But the co. takes fine care to pocket its own
little lot before even £5 of the £250 comes
to the investor.
For the 12 months to May 31 last, Allen
Taylor, one of the most efficient of N. S.
Wales timber concerns with large forests on
the North Coast, showed a loss of £29,990,
and has not paid a div. for the last four
years. Its fully-paid pound shares fetch 3s.
in the market; but what the future may hold
it is impossible to say.
Uralla was one of the richest alluvial
fields in N.S.W., but when the miners had
to follow the wash under as much as 30ft. of
drift sand, the ground was gradually aban-
doned. Now r , Uralla Gold, N.L., proposes
to go after the lost leads. Nominal is
£12,000 in 48,000 shares of ss. each,
of which 24,000 are offered, and a
further 24,000 paids go to the vendors for
titles .to 180 acres of Crown land and 220
acres of private lands. Values from the
Sydney Flat drifts, which are to be worked,
are estimated at 2s. 6d. per yard. The co.
lias an option on tw r o portable sluicing
plants at £4OOO. It is reckoned that one
plant can deal with 50 yards per hour;
later it is proposed to instal a steam-shovel
to handle overburden. Production is ex-
pected to begin by the end of the year, and
setting-in exes, etc., are put at not more
than £750. Plenty of water is available.

Several finds have been reported from
Gloucester (N.S.W.), where mining has been
going on sporadically for years. The latest
is on the old Barrington field, some 12 miles
west. An officer of the Mines Depart-
ment states that the reef outcrops for about
two chains, and that potholing has proved
it for another ten. Width has been proved
at one spot only; here there is sft. of iron-
stained quartz carrying fine gold specks.
Samples taken from the outcrop, 3ft. down,
assayed loz. 2dwt. per ton. The history of
gold deposits in this district suggests that
the stone may be the capping of a shoot.
!,! * *
If the parcel of ore which Mt. Morgan
has sent for treatment at the Mt. Isa pilot
plant discloses enough gold and copper to
make their extraction profitable at present
prices, preparations will be made to treat
some 3000 tons of the stone per week. This
would mean employment of 300 additional
hands at Mt. Morgan.
❖ ❖ ❖ ❖
It is rather pathetic when one thinks of
the millions of pounds’ worth of gold that
the field once turned out; still, Charters
Towers is reported to be quite bucked over
its October return of 2590 z. of retorted gold
worth £756. This came from 392 tons taken
from small shows and old workings. The
stuff was put through by the Venus mill,
now a State concern, but one which, in
the roaring days, would have put more than
that over the plates in 24 hours. Some of
the stone came from a 40ft. shaft, on the
Moonstone Flat, sunk over 30 years ago by
the father of the two men who worked it
this time. Twelve tons of the ore went 340 z.

Carl Lindberg sums up Wiluna (W.A.) :
(1) Deposits are more erratic than indicated
by original sampling. (2) The west lode is
wholly in ealcschist, and appearances are
that both it and the east lode may event-
ually become contact lodes, or pass into
dolerite and show improvement at greater
depth. (3) Revised ore reserves above
450 ft. total 780,000 tons, averaging 335. 6d.
Of this quantity, 245,000 tons of 335. ore
will have to be left in pillars. This reduces
the ore available for stoping to 535,000
tons, assaying 335. 9d. (4) Difference
between original and present estimates is
due to there being more data to work upon
now. (5) Until more development work
has been done deliveries to the mill are not
likely to exceed 25,000 tons each month.
(6) Metallurgical investigations are ex-
pected to result in better recoveries and
reduced costs. Lindberg says that nothing
has been disclosed by the recent detailed
examination to cause serious apprehensiou
as to the future of the mine. Favorable
developments in the two bottom levels, he
says, confirm this view.

Some months ago A. H. Collier, of Lon-
don, took an option over the Mararoa Co.’.s
Reedy property (W.A.) on behalf of
Loudon investors, chiefly representative of
the interests behind Wiluna. It was stated
that if the option was exercised a co.
would be formed with a capital not exceed-
ing £300,000 to acquire and work the show.
The option expires at the end of this
month, and shareholders in Mararoa are
wondering what is going to happen. Should
Collier abandon the option, Broken Hill Prop,
or a London crowd might have a look at it.

Ingliston Consols, at Meekatharra, has
closed down. Next to Sons of Gwalia and
Wiluna it was the biggest gold-producer ou
Westralia’s northern fields. Want of funds
plus lack of ore is said to be the cause.
Time and again when the outjlook was
clouded good ore was struck in new ground,
and it would surprise a Bulletin man who
saw the mine a short time ago if the last
lias been heard of the show.

Associated Northern’s mines at Ivalgoorlie
and Ora Banda are for sale, and so is the
mostly rusted and out-of-date plant thereon.
Over two million sterling was extracted from
the bonanza Oroya shoot, which coursed
through the Ivalgoorlie mine. It is said
there is a possibility of something having
been left. The Ora Banda shows yielded
over half a million pounds’ worth of bullion
down to 700 ft., and are still reckoned to
be worth tackling at and below that level.

Westralia is getting out of the rut of low
gold production. The October yield was
13,0550 z. in excess of that for October,
1930, and the highest for that month for
ten years. The last ten months’ output
shows an increase of 60,9220 z. on that for
the corresponding period of 1930. More-
over, the exchange premium made the out-
put worth an extra £574,693. The largest
premium (£131,794) was paid last month,
following the fall in sterling. Several new
but small mines have started production, and
the returns of some of the big and mostly
old-established shows are being expanded.

“Old Warden”: As was generally anti-
cipated, members of the Australian Gold
Exploration ,Cos., which set out with banners
flying and drums beating to locate the alleged
lost reef in Centralia, in the pursuit of
which Lasseter lost his life, have returned
empty-handed to Hermannsberg mission. It
is stated that though the search has been
unsuccessful there is no intention of aban-
doning the chase. The whole story of the
“lost reef” has been so obviously chimerical
that one wonders at the extent of human
credulity.

The Federated Malayan States, the
world’s largest tin producer, passed legis-
lation to control production and export of
the ore as from March 1. For the six
months to August 31 production was cut by
25 per cent., and then by 60 per cent, for
September, October and November. One
result was that exports of metallic tin from
January to August (39,809 tons) dropped
3567 tons (8.22 p.c.) compared with the
corresponding period of 1930. The London
price of the metal was fairly steady around
£llß per ton for the three and a half months
to the middle of March; the figure slipped
to £lO2 Is. 3d. early in June, but had
jumped to £l2O 3s. 9d. by the end of the
month. The highest price recorded for the
eight months to August 31 was £124 13s. 9d.
on March 18; the average was £ll4 14s sd.
For the same period visible supplies
(50,914 tons) were 7289 tons heavier than
for the corresponding months of 1930; con-
sumption (76,939) was 8242 tons lighter,
but supplies received (85,550) also eased by
15,330 tons. Apparently some surreptitious
holdings were unloaded. Rumors that the
depreciation of sterling may affect the opera-
tion of the international restriction agree-
ment have led to re-affirmation, by the Tin
Producers’ Association, of the intention of
the five participating Governments to con-
tinue working the scheme in close co-operation.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
( Transfer-red from Service Department.)
What is the position of pref. shareholders
in Queensland National Pastoral Go.? Are
they likely to get accrued divs.? —692o.
There are 250,000 in a paid capital of
£850,000. They are entitled to a fixed cumu-
lative 7 p.c. and have priority as to capital.
At Dec. 31 next there will be £105,000
(Bs. 4|d. per share) of accrued divs. com-
ing to them. For the five years to Dec. 31
last the co.’s losses totalled £491,293, mak-
ing the deficit on ordinary shareholders’
account £475,519. Thus, the prefs. were
covered by net tangibles with a book value
of 295. lid. per share. There was £241,390
coming to outsiders, mainly the bank. This
may stand in the way of pref. divs. for
a while. There is a possibility that the
prefs. will be asked to forego arrears of
divs. in return for, say, participating rights.
The co, intends to reconstruct; no hint has
yet been given as to the terms. Following
the lift in wool prices' and improved
seasonal conditions in far-western Queens-
land, the market has lifted its bid for the
prefs. from 4s. 6d. to 10s.
(1) How do North Broken Hill and
Al t. Isa ores compare in* average assay values f
(2) Which has the greater proved ore re-
serves? (3) Does Alt. Isa claim ability to
pay divs. at present metal prices? (4)
Working at capacity which co. could produce
the greater amount of bullion? —6948.
(1) North does not publish average grade
of its ore reserves. Ore treated last year
assayed 15.6 p.c. lead, lOoz. silver and 12.4
p.c. zinc. This is about 5 p.c. more lead and
soz. more silver per ton than ore treated
by Isa. (2) Isa has upwards of 30,000,000
tons proved; North’s latest report shows
4,200,000 tons proved. Large bodies are
known to exist outside proved areas of both
cos. (3) No, not with present equipment
and at present costs. (4) On the basis ol
present capacity of respective plants, Isa>
lead bullion output would probably exceed
the North’s by about 2000 to 3000 tons pe>
annum. Both cos. are increasing the capacitj
of the plants and improving their treatment
methods.
BRIEF ANSWERS.

two; best hope of finding a buyer is through the
secs. (2) About 3s. 6d. —no difference now between
the two series A.H.: If, by continued non-payment
of premiums, you had exhausted the surrender value,
you would have no redress at law. .. .M.8.H.: (1)
Very well handled; and we still prefer the ords.
(2) A lean time ahead... .M.F.K.: Ask them if
they will suspend premium payments for, say, three
years in return for a reduction of sum insured....
J.W.P.: (1) Safe enough; but not very promising
for bonuses. (2) Yes, unless it is specially barred.
. ...0.T.M.: You can do much better... .L.W.V.:

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Men Who Are Over-insured
In these days a distressing number of
people are in trouble over their insurance
premiums and The Bulletin’s Service
Department is turned to for advice many
times a week. In most cases information is
sought about surrender values. One piece
of advice seems nearly always good : Put your
troubles fairly and fully before the office
which issued your policy. The greater the
office and the more formidable it appears
in the policy-holder’s eyes, the readier it
nearly always will be to help the distressed.
Of course, it will want to keep its policy-
holder, and so it ought to; for he cannot get
out, especially in the early years of his
policy, without making a substantial sacri-
fice. There are practically no sets of diffi-
culties and adverse circumstances with which
these big offices have not been faced i and
they vil.i welcome frank communications and
tender expert advice.
Xu most cases, the present trouble is over-
jus .ranee ; a policy which had in other days
seemed ample became utterly inadequate when
on x wouldn’t buy one-half of what it did
• days before the war. And, anyhow,
ision for dependants seemed easy
i. ’ heat at Bs. a bushel and a sheep worth
a pound a year. To-day in thousands of
ue?it is impossible-to keep the new poli-
cies going; and it depends entirely upon a
man’s circumstances and his prospects what
ought to be done about them. One of the
first people to be consulted in every case
should be the office which holds the policy.
But it is little use writing baldly that you
hold such and such a policy and what will
they give you for it? Only a full and frank
statement of your position and your difficul-
ties and your prospects will enable the
office to give any advice really worth having.
And nobody outside the office which issued
the policy can give that advice, because
nobody else will know precisely what any
office is prepared to do in given circum-
stances.
Australia in Britain
“There are 10,000 shops in Scotland,”
says H'. M. Ford, commercial manager of
the Clyde Navigation Trust, “and in not
more than 10 or so can you buy a pound of
Australian butter.” This is part of Mr.
Ford’s complaint to The Bulletin that,
in its sales campaign in the U.K., Australia
concentrates too much on London, “the most
saturated of all British markets.” His point
is that Australia will miss business if it does
not realise that great changes are taking
place in the distribution of spending money
in Britain. The slip from the standard was
at once followed by a brightening of northern
industrial centres. While'dumping of Con-
tinental goods was possible, London bene-
fited as the great financial centre. The drop
in sterling made dumping difficult; and a
tariff will make it more difficult still.
London will thus lose some of its financial
business; and the benefit will be spxvad over
home manufacturers all through the Kingdom.
There will be a gain, too, in the export trade,
to the further advantage of the manu-
facturing centres of the north. Mr. Ford
points out that almost every one of these
great centres has some “development” body
or other which would gladly co-operate with
Australia in pushing local sales of its pro-
ducts.
The Job for Young Jimmy
We have a long way to go yet before
educationists and parents, especially parents,
arc freed from the conviction that the only
job worth striving for is one where young-
Jimmy, unlike Dad, won’t have to take off
his coat, and Matilda, unlike Mum, won’t
have to soil her hands. Three years ago the
Vic. Education Department with the assist-
ance of the Vocational Guidance Association
(a body of keenly interested citizens) com-
menced to build up throughout its schools a
well-conceived system of vocational guidance.
To aid teachers and committees to adequately
carry out their new duties, articles on the
following avocations and the means of entry
have thus far been officially issued: Account-
ancy, advertising, apiculture, architecture,
banking, chemistry, commercial art, dentistry,
dressmaking, engineering, farming, journalism,
law, marine engineering, medicine, mercantile
marine, millinery, municipal employee, nurs-
ing, office work, pharmacy, post office, public
service, teaching. Excluding “engineering”
and “marine,” which may mean anything, if
you check them off you will see that, out of
the 24 listed. 16 refer to white-collar jobs
for boys, and two to genteel occupations for
girls. And it is significant that the two
dealing with primary industry should appear
only this year.
The Russian Five ; Year Plan
From an Australian engineer, writing from
a Baltic port:—-
Russia ceases to be a mystery; it is easy now to
see most of what the country has to show. The
Soviet authorities were a little nervous at first,
naturally, and there were stand-off .signals in many
places; but you can poke in now at most points.
The explanation is that things are being run now
on the more or less business lines of the Five-Year
Plan, which is developing into the most widely organ-
ised competitive effort in the world or that the world,
I suppose, has ever seen. You couldn’t keep things
dark with as many as 400 American workmen —
highly-skilled operatives mostly, introduced as in-
structors —at one factory. This was at the huge
tractor workshop at Tsaritsyn.
The more the leaders of the Plan get to know
their tools, the less they must think of them. I
don’t know Tsaritsyn personally, but I know
a score .of engineers and fitters who have
worked there or passed through there, and they
tell hair-raising stories of ignorance and incapacity
and mere brutishness. The manager, Vasili Ivanoff,
was chosen to match his tools, and the tales told
make him almost a tornado of energy and violence!
But he has not been able to get the results —not
two-fifths of the scheduled results.
And it is not only the dulness and sloth of these
people; I have myself had evidence of a gloomy
hatred, because somebody knew what he wanted
and drove them by the most direct path to get it.
There is scarcely a paper which doesn’t report
sabotage once a week at least. Curiously enough
these references are not suppressed ; actually
they are permitted in order to justify the
outbursts of what seem to us terrific punish-
ments. The paper “Pravda” lately introduced two
new words to the Russian language—one to signify
“the machine breaker”; the other “the maker of
scrap.” One great factory is reported by the
“Pravda” to have looked, on its first birthday, “an
old half-ruined building with broken windows, all
the passages full of scrap and broken plant, and idle
half its time from breakdowns."’
Free Travelling
Dear Bulletin, — I suggest to the Queens-
land Government that it would be far
cheaper to put one empty truck on every
goods train for the benefit of the travelling
unemployed. No amount of police vigilance
will keep bagmen off the trains. I met two
bicycle bagmen the other day who told me
they often jump the rattler, mounts and
all, when tired. If provision were made
for carrying the bona fide workless, stern
measures could be used against other people.
A bank clerk struck up acquaintance with
me in a town the other day and tried to
elicit the latest tips about the rattler. He
wanted to get to Brisbane for his holidays
and hated paying a fare. I told him to
ask the stationmaster. —Yours, Gad.
Australia in Canada
From an ex-Australian, at Vancouver: —
Canadians, especially on the Pacific Coast, are
anxious to make the new Canadian-Australian trade
treaty an enduring success. The Department of
Commerce, backed by the press, is encouraging
everyone to purchase Australian goods, and the re-
sponse has been fairly satisfactory. One sees Aus-
tralian oranges displacing the Californian product,
and the Government liquor stores, which formerly
sold only one or two brands, are now offering a
really good selection of Australian wines at reason-
able prices. But except oranges and wines there is
little Australian produce for sale.
Vancouver, the nearest Canadian city to Australia
and the port of arrival for Australians travelling not
only to Canada but to Europe, is not anything like
as Australian-minded as it should be; and the
fault is not Vancouver’s.
At this moment a “goodwill” party is touring
the Dominion, consisting of A. E. Hyland, director
of publicity for Australia in the U.K.; H. E. Laffer,
representing the wine, grape and tree-fruit growers;
and C. E. Critchley, assistant trade commissioner.
They are addressing public meetings and having a very
good reception, and the press is giving them fine
publicity. We are also expecting the Canadian
Constructor with an exhibition cargo of Australia’s
dried fruit, peanuts, veneers, hardwoods, poultry,
butter, fruit juices, canned meats, oranges, rabbits,
wool and wooltops; but once the trade ambassadors
have departed, interest in

“Mandateite”: In
June copra was quoted
£lO 55., London (the
lowest price for many
years), which meant
£4 10s. to £5 for the
planter. And it costs
from £7 to £8 to pro-
duce. The moratorium
which lapsed on June
30 has been extended
for another year, and
the local Administra-
tion has temporarily
suspended the collec-
tion of the education
tax on indentured
labor, which means a
saving to the planter
of Is. per month per
laborer. Even so, the
planters say, they
can’t keep going. They
want the abolition of
the export duty on
copra and a reduced
import duty on
laborers’ rations in
order to cut down pro-
duction costs. To
maintain budget equili-
brium they suggest
placing a higher tariff
on luxuries, a cut in
Government officials’
salaries, ext e n ding
their working hours
and abolishing the
long leave, which con-
sists of six months’
leave after six years’
service, in addition to
the three months’ re-
creation leave at the
end of every 21
months. “That’s all
very well,” says the
official. “But what
about cutting down
salaries in the big
firms, and thus allow
the planter to obtain
his goods cheaper?”
And there’s something-
in that, too. Already
the Administration has
put the yacht Frank-
lin out of commission
after the Auditor-
General had pointed
out that running ex-
penses equalled about
21 per cent, of the
year’s revenue. An-
other step is the aboli-
tion of the Govern-
ment motor service in
Rabaul for the trans-
port of officials to and
from their offices. But it also seems reason-
able that the commercial section should adopt
some measures to further assist the primary
producer, who is, after all, the backbone of
the Territory, and, incidentally, the only in-
dividual who is feeling the world’s depression
to any extent in the Temtoiy.
The Man on the Roof
The plumber has a day’s work:
I wasn’t keen on the job when my friend Baldwin
asked me to attend to the roof of a house he owns
at Box Hill, because it really needs about £3O
spent on it and I knew Baldwin couldn’t run it; but
I did the best I could and was glad when the job
was finished-the thermometer climbed to 92 degrees
that day. Between whiles I surveyed the family—
elderly woman, young woman, two men aged between
25 and 30 and another young woman who came home
in a hurry a little after noon and departed just
before one- evidently working. The young men
filled in time playing cards and resting on the
shady front verandah, occasionally assuring me that
it must be hot up on the roof. There was a quarter
acre of land attached to the place, which would
crow vegetables galore, but not a spud nor a bean
was there nor any sign of spade or hoe. Just
before I left the young woman slipped out with an
attache-case and what I recognised as a sustenance
card. Reaching home, tired, I asked the wife if
there were any letters. “Only one—and you don’t
want that.” It turned out to be a request from Mr
Chenoweth to forward 1 o. ~ ng
amended assessment of the Unemployment Relief Tax
land and the cool, shady verandah. Also the hot roof.

In Sydney last week a firm was fined on
eight charges of failing to pay the correct
minimum wage. It pleaded that the eight
employees had failed to notify that they had
reached the age of 21 “under the mistaken
idea that they might be retrenched.” But
there is no mistaken idea about it in hun-
dreds of cases. Employers who have been
paying the utmost farthing they can auord in
wages have been faced with the alternative
of breaking the law and chancing punishment
or sacking the employee: and though the
employee often begs to be kept on at the
old rate, the employer' will not accept the
risk. In many cases nobody at all is put
on to take the place of the discharged ; so
the only effect is to add another to the dole,
The law ought to be altered to allow of some
discretion in the event of an agreement being
reached between the employer, the employee
and the Department oT Labor and Industry,

“Oh. Lady, Lady!” is the latest William-
sonian excuse for a lavish display ot
feminine frockery and a not too lavish ex-
hibition of male and feminine vocalism at
Melbourne Royal. The story of the girl
burglar who is' introduced into Mrs. b ar-
ringdon’s “place” on the north shore ot
Long Island as the former paramor of the
lady’s prospective son-in-law is free from
any suspicion of probability, and it has other
advantages, .such as endless opportunities for
Leo Franklyn, Dot Brunton and Cecil Kella-
way to break the thread of narrative witn
the unfateful shears of their excellent fool-
ing. It has the disadvantage for the male
chorus of being placed in a modern setting,
which compels the said males to sing senti-
mental ditties in that travesty of elegance
the morning coat, and as the said males
have obviously been selected more for their
vocal gifts than for their ability to look
elegant in morning coats there is a lack of
brilliance about the ensembles. It is curious
to note what a disastrous effect this has
on their deportment. They all look as happy
as so many horses in the rain, whereas in
the just-departed “Merry Widow” they
looked as jolly in their variegated costumes
as so many sandboys. The ladies, on the
other hand, look lovely and seem to
thoroughly enjoy themselves, and the question
arises whether the eminent citizens who are
at present so busy exhorting the nation oyer
the wireless to throw off their depression
by thinking of new ways to make money
would not be better employed designing a
new male costume, such as blouses open at
the neck, hats with feathers in them and
tight scarlet trousers. “Oh, Lady, Lady !’ is
the piece which revealed to the Firm the
virtues of Dot Brunton as a comedienne, and
time has not spotted her charm or planted
crow’s feet on her vivacity. Kellaway is also
first rate as Cyril Townsley, the ass-detec-
tive, and Leo Franklyn spreads the jam of
Cockney humor over a larger slice of the
collective loaf than usual. Romola Hansen
misses no opportunity of looking pretty and
behaving archly, but the songs allotted her
give her no chance of displaying strength of
voice or ardor of feeling. Frank Leighton
—he is the romantic hero—has cultivated a
stage walk suggestive of an advanced con-
dition of inebriation, and should be reserved
for drunk parts until he gets over it. Sid-
ney Burchall is a somewhat mature-looking
partner for the stunning Jean Duncan, but
his rich voice is an asset to a play that pur-
ports to be musical. Mona Zeppel and
Etic Bush bring the house down with some
spectacular dancing.
The Diamond Follies, who opened at
Sydney Palace on Saturday under the direc-
tion of Maurice Diamond, gave a bright,
fast-moving show. They can all dance
a bit, sing a bit and act a bit. and their
talents have been very cleverly utilised.
About the most effective of the 30 numbers
that make up the programme is a contrast
between the honeymoon of to-day and that
of 50 years ago. “Indian Love” is a ballet
scene with a flavor of artistic taste, and in
“The Little Things of Life” the domestic
sentiments are touched upon. lightly and
pleasantly. The material used is all new to
Sydney, and the show has snap, ensemble
scenes in particular being efficiently stage-
managed. Maurice Diamond, Wallie Cor-
nick, Edna Moncricff, Margo McKenzie,
Billie Delaney and Robert Raymond stand
out among the principals.

The new musical comedy at Sydney
Opera House, “Love Lies,” has just enough
plot to string a collection of revue numbers
together. Alfred Frith, John Wood, Clem
Dawe, Rene Riano and Elsie Parkes seem
to enjoy the turbulent farce scenes, and
chuckles are plentiful. The co. is to pro-
duce a straight-out revue next week, ana
it won’t notice any difference. Neither will
the audience.

During the recent cold snap no cases of
frostbite were reported from Melbourne

Ernest Rolls’s policy of speeding up revue.

The experience of the Vic. Professional
Orchestra at Melbourne Town Hall confirms
this Showman’s suspicion that many of the
people who flock to hear the older-estab-
lished orchestras are not so much music-
lovers as persons who put up with highbrow
music for the privilege of gazing at the
back hair of their favorite conductor and
being in the swim. There have been faults
in some of the V.P.O.’s performances.
Weekly changes of conductors do not con-
duce to satisfactory team-work, and there
lias been evidence of want of rehearsal about
some of the bigger works. But the poorly-
attended concert of last week was well worth
the prices asked. Under William G. James’s
direction the pros, handled Beethoven’s
“First Symphony” very capably. If Ludwig
had never composed his third, fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth symphonies,
his first would have been regarded as a
great work. Though seldom played it pans
out more precious metal to the ounce than
the efforts of some other composers yield
to the ton. Edward Goll did brilliant work
at the piano in the Arensky Concerto in
F minor, though all that glisters in that
composition is not gold. Miss Saffo Arnav
sang operatic numbers effectively and Richard
Chugg was eloquent upon the flute. The
pros, are steadily elevating the standard of
their programmes. The only concession to
popular taste was the “Cinderella” of Eric
Coates.

Jim Gerald continues to put up a tip-top
show at Melb. Tiv. There is character in
all of James’s fooling, and after he has talked
about a sausage for five minutes the comes-
tible acquires as much personality as a
politician. The rest of the entertainment is
mainly leg and girl, and should easily see
the festive season through without changing
its address.

Having previously announced that he
would show that Drinkwater’s ‘Bird in
Hand” could be played as a comedy, instead
of as a farce, which has been the method ot
previous producers, Helton Daniell came
up for trial at Melb. Playhouse last week
and gained a popular verdict. He himselt
played Thomas Greenleaf, and that plethoric
diehard was a much more interesting figure
in the absence of fallabout. Charles Langley
and Harold Harwood made the most of Mr.
Blanquet and Ambrose Godolphin respec-
tively, and Joyce Turner gave a pleasant
impression of Joan Greenleaf.

The Firm can always be trusted to follow
its own precedent in grand opera,_ and the
season which starts in Melbourne in Febru-
ary, will open, as did the last, with the
spectacular “Aida.” A precedent which me
Firm is forced to disregard is to have the
premiere at His Majesty s. The interior of
that playhouse is still a chaos of charred
timber and upholstery, except in the corner
where Tliring is furiously engaged produc-
ing liis next talkie. The production of
“Aida” may reach the high standard of
magnificence of previous occasions, but half
the splendor of a gr’opera first night is
owed to the rows on rows of flashing female
bosoms and white sliirtfronts in the audi-
torium, and for that the Royal does not offer
so much scope as did His Majesty’s.
Poverty Point
“Si Anu” : It was a wild night in the little
Javanese town. A real theatrical company
had burst upon us, and all the whites from
the coffee arid sugar plantations and fabriks
for miles around came into the Societeit de
Club. All the metropolis was there —fully
a score of fat men and fatter ladies, of all
shades of brown, the product of exposure to
THE DIAMOND FOLLIES (SYDNEY PALACE).
Maurice Diamond hands Wallie Cornick a little tribute to his singing. Len Rich
beams upon the scene.

the sun, or of miscegenation, perhaps. The
performance was principally clown stuff of
the circus variety, and the petrified blunt-
pointed jokes were delivered in English, but
the Dutchmen roared at them till their fat
sides ached —exiles aren’t particular. The
Britishers cheered them to the echo, clapped,
stamped and encored. The jokes got more
and more unintelligible, but still we clapped;
and the louder we clapped the more the
Dutchmen roared. The high-kicking and
skirt-dancing were in the most approved
style of 50 years ago. Such a finished
performance had never been staged in
the town before. The Dutchmen, already
drunk with gin, got drunker with merri-
ment. Afterwards we went and languished
at the stage door and proffered bouquets
of nipalx-palm and alang-alang grass to
the liouris, who had sweated till they
looked as if they had fallen into a river
with their clothes on. But our divini-
ties—there were two of them—were not
British. One was French, the other Italian
or Russian, we couldn’t find out which.
However, the proprietor was an Englishman
—nay, a Maorilander. Ilooroo! We did
him proud, poor beggar! He was of ex-
ceeding common clay, but was he not a
fellow-countryman? He had toured all Asia
with his sorry troupe: Burma, Cochin-China,
Sumatra, wherever he could hope for an
audience, yellow, black, white or brown. He
had taught his company the words of their
English ditties, and their smutty jokes, but
not a syllable of their own languages could
he understand, nor did they understand a
word of his. He drank in our pure Aus-
tralian like a famished man. He poured
forth all his troubles and we patted him on
the back and told him what a fine fellow he
was. He had left a youngster in Surabaya
who was dying of malaria. He was bolting
all over the country trying to rake up enough
money to take them both back to Sydney
town. His company was absconding every
day by dribs and drabs. The two foreign
witches were all he had left, except the chap
in the orchestra who played the triangles,
while he banged the ivories. Altogether lie
was quite down on his uppers. Poor chap!
And he was a Maorilander! Our own Maori-
landers swapped reminiscences of Wan-
ganui, Nelson, Wull’nton and Wakatip’ to
make him happy, until he almost wept. He
was going on to Rogodjampe and Sitoe-
bondo and Loemadjang and places with
even more unpronounceable names, if his
company held together. But the Dutch-
men were too fat and lazy. They did not
understand true art. They did not know a
good show when they saw it; and you couldn’t
deny that his wan a good sliow\ They refused
to turn out of their armchairs to fill their little
Sociefeits de Club. Here he really wept.
Unlucky cuss! And. Lord! he was a Napier
man. Oh, he was certainly broke. He
hadn’t made enough here to pay the hotel
expenses of his clamorous retinue and he
must leave for the next town by the morning
train. And he was a Maorilander, poor
chap! So we filled his arms with Bul-
letins 10 months old, and his inside with
whisky, having no other way of showing our
sympathy and feeling shy about handing
round the hat; and about four in the morn-
ing we saw him to his bed speechless.
“0. Ma”: The movie entrepreneur being
prepared to stick at nothing, Theodora
Dreiser’s gigantic “American Tragedy” is
screened under the direction of Von Stern-
berg, who was responsible for “Under-
world.” How much even Von Sternberg’s
genius can get of Dreiser’s gargantuan
study of a sordid little American psyche
into an hour and a half’s entertainment it
is difficult to say. but it is not the first
time something of the sort has been attempted
with the novel. An American tabloid daily
offered such a huge bribe to allow the work
to be illustrated by a strip artist that the
author consented. The result ran as a
serial for some months, and is one of the
curiosities of literature.
“Cauboy”: The era of internationalism
may solve various problems, but it will plunge
playwrights into grave difficulties. Drama-
tists have always found that the easiest way
to win the sympathy of their audiences has
been to hold up other nations to ridicule.
Even Shakspeare was not immune from the
suspicion of exploiting racial prejudice.
Every Elizabethan playgoer who had popped
his shirt on occasions must have rejoiced
at the discomfiture of Shylock. In Javanese
drama the comic character is usually a
Eurasian, made up blacker than the native.
In Chinese drama the Japanese, represented
by a dwarf-like creature, flatters the national
vanity of the Celestial theatregoer. The
American producers have long enjoyed them-
selves at the expense of Englishmen. Now
the Australian Harrison Owen, in his film,
“Uneasy Virtue,” redresses the balance,
more or less, by presenting us with an
American as his worst example of homo
nitwitticus. No doubt when Frank Thring
gets properly going we will be provided with
a procession of Englishmen, Americans,
Chinamen and Russians in the role of clowns
and villains.
“Shoot, Burn You!”: Following on the
success of “Viennese Nights,” a rush of
Danubian Blues may be confidently expected.
Hollywood already has in preparation a
number of successors, and the biggest hit in
London legit, at the moment is “Waltzes
of Vienna.” The melodramatic story is woven
round a romantic conflict between the
Strausses, who are also responsible for the
music. The Firm will shortly present the
opus to Australia.
“S.T.S.”: Peter Dawson undertakes to do
his best to get “The Song of Australia”
accepted as the national anthem the Com-
monwealth lacks. Through its 60-odd years
of life, the locally-produced song has steadily
established itself in S.A., and it deserves
wider fame. The words are better than in
most efforts of the kind, and the lilting
melody gives a chance for all hands to come
in with a rousing “Austra-li-a" three times
at the finish.
“Bumpkin”: It was generous of Mr. Mc-
Master, who was seen mainly in musical
comedy in Australia, to come out in defence
of this country against the foul aspersions
of Maisie Gay, who lately remarked that
Australians like anything blatant and
obvious, and have no use for anything subtle
and romantic. Mr. McMaster recalled the
alleged fact that he played Shakspeare,
Ibsen and Pinero to ecstatic Australian
houses. What is the trutn? I have seen
more of the Australian theatregoer even
than Mr. McMaster, albeit from a different
side of the footlights. The only theatre-
goer I have seen who was ecstatic at an
Ibsen play was drunk, and was escorted
out during the second interval. He had mis-
taken the show for a moving picture. I
have only seen Australian audiences ecstatic
at a Shakspeare performance when they were
under the age of 15 and Allan Wilkie was
playing the Bard in terms of a Mo farce.
All that even Irene Vanbrugh was able to
do with an Australian audience in a Pinero
play was to plunge it into a state of acute
depression over the woes of the second Mo.
Tanqucray. A few plays that come under
the category of “subtle” have been pro-
fessionally presented in this country in the
last decade. They include “They Knew
What They Wanted,” “The Road to Rome”
and “Young Woodley.” All were complete
or partial flops. None of them produced
more ecstasy than could be held in one hand
comfortably. Perhaps Mr. McMaster’s ex-
perience was happier than mine, or perhaps
he is only after a bit of cheap advertise-
ment.
“L. de R.”: Mo was recently offered
£llO a week by Sir Oswald Stoll.
After carefully considering the pros and
cons Mo rejected the offer in favor of his
present screw, less than a third as much.
The engagement was conditional on a week’s
successful trial, and the eminent comedian
decided that, while lie is popular in Bourke-
street, he might be out of his element in the
Strand. It is possible Mo is right.
“Shoot, Durn Yuh!”: Australia is not
the only portion of the Empire where the
British film is having a hard fight for sur-
vival. In Singapore the situation is com-
plicated by the attack being from two fronts.
Last year the polyglot island had just short
of six million feet of celluloid unloaded on
it. America accounted for approximately 74
p.e., Britain for only 5 p.c. Except for 3
p.c. of European film, the remainder came
from China.
“Cauboy”: Peregrinating the Common-
wealth at the moment are four talkies in
which that sterling actor Frank Bradley has
taken leading roles on the flesh-an’-blood
stage in Australia. They are “The Sport
of Kings,” “The Squeaker,” “White Cargo”
and “So This Is Love.” Not one of the
talkie performances is equal to his.
The Palette,
An outbreak of art shows aimed at catch-
ing the eye of the Christmas shopper indi-
cates the approach of the plum-pudding
season in Melbourne. The 28 small water-
colors by Blamire Young at Everyman’s
reveal this artist as still preoccupied with
repetitions of his original formula, w r hich
has lost some of its impressiveness since
the youthful James Flett demonstrated that
he could do the same sort of thing just as
effectively. F. R. Crozier’s oils at New-
man’s Galleries include some hesitant
attempts to look Nature in the face, “Skat-
ing on the Ice” being amongst the most
successful. A work of a Christmas flavor
is the immense panel for the chancel of St.
James the Less, at Mt. Eliza (Vic.), painted
by Violet Teague and hanging at the
Athenmum. It represents the Adoration of
Angels, of Shepherds and of Kings, and is
something unique in Australian religious
pictures. In one corner the youths and
maidens of the township may recognise por-
traits of themselves singing in an angelic
chorus. Other identities appear as St.
Joseph, Mary and other figures in the Bible
story, aud Dr. Teague, father of the painter,
is one of the three kings come to worship
the newborn Child. The picture follows the
traditions of church painting faithfully.
Gilbert Roach is the latest exhibitor at
S.A. Society of Arts gallery. His work in
color is careful rather than distinguished;
but one small water-color has found favor
with the Art Gallery of Adelaide, which also
bought an etching; Roach’s work in this
medium is distinctly his strongest side.
The reality of the cartoonist is an entirely
different thing from the reality of the
painter. The cartoonist is working in the
realm of ideas, the painter in that of visual
appearances. A circle of black ink with four
dots inside it drawn on white paper con-
veys the idea of a face, but it is not in the
least like the appearance of a face which it is
the painter’s job to get. When a cartoonist
turns painter he lias to forget all he lcnoics
about a face and define what his first impres-
sion actually w-as. The trouble is that nine
people (or critics) out of ten would regard
the circle and the dots as more real than
the most perefect painting, because they
think of faces in terms of a convention
rather than in terms of reality. So, in his
show of oils at the Meldrum Galleries, Mel-
bourne, Percy Leason, painter, is likely to
be judged from the standpoint of the very
conventions that Percy Leason, cartoonist,
has done his bit to fix in the public mind.
The pictures at any rate are a tribute to
Leason’s own ability to free himself from
the conventions of the cartoonist. The only
portrait in the group is not the most impres-
sive evidence of this, but the Eltliam land-
scapes are full of the sensation of real
light and of natural color. The spectral
pallor of the swamp gum, the vividness of
the spring grass, the mystery of a foggy
morning, the sheeted whiteness of a blos-
soming cherry-plum and a group of children
at a swung have been caught so well that
one is left with the impression that one has
been out of doors; and that is a rare
impression to get from a picture show.

A magnificent goldfield lias just been dis-
covered up North. From the local paper we
gather that there is gold in the water, in
the air, everywhere. It is so plentiful that
every miner carries his gold-belt wherever he
goes. The barmen at the local public-houses
make large sums every week by brushing off
and saving the gold-dust which travellers
bring in on their clothes. The handcuffs of
the local police are gold-bands. A river
runs through the camp; nets are set in the'
river overnight to catch the nuggets which
come floating down, and the miners make
their breakfast off the goldfish which get
caught along with the nuggets. Wash china
in the stream and it comes out gold plate.
A “whaler” once went in swimming and came
out completely clad in gold armor; not be-
ing satisfied with a thirteen-carat suit, he
went in again for a second coat and was
drowned with the weight. A half-caste baby
was changed into a golden cherub by immer-
sion in the water so that its mother refused
to own it. Cattle driven into the water so
that they may drink walk out on the other
side gilded and watered stock. Calves walk
in and, on emerging at the other side, get
worshipped. To obtain a rich golden butter
it is only necessary to kill and throw in a
goat. People with the jaundice have it
turned into gold-fever right off. Is it any
wonder that people have the gold-fever when
they live in a region so permeated with the
stuff as this is?—l.6/7/’B9.]

Sprat.
The average western town is of an inflam-
mable order. It is built chiefly of old boards,
kerosene tins, grass, bark and all manner ot
combustible wreckage, and is liable to blaze
spontaneously at the shortest notice. There-
fore, whenever a light appears on the horizon,
the fire brigade—when there is one —gets its
old, dismantled turret ready for action, and
harnesses up the goat with a clothes-line,
and makes sure that the water-jug is filled
and the squirt in working order, and starts
out full tear for the scene of action. One
night not long ago the people of a town out
on the plains were roused by the incen-
diary clang of the alarm bell, and looking forth
they saw a red glare far away on the sky-line.
It looked as if the whole globe had commenced
to flare up, and the firemen felt that a great
undertaking was in front of them. Their
own horse was dead, but they impounded the
animal that propelled the local dirt-cart, and
hitched it to the engine before it was awake.
The tailor seized on a helmet which concealed
everything but his legs, and grasped the reins,
and the butcher hung on behind with another
helmet that barely covered one ear. Some of
the brigade was in its night-robe, and some
of it was attired in a dishcloth and a bell-
topper, and the captain had hardly anything
at all except a false tooth and a boot, but
the claims of duty were above all other con-
siderations. so they woke up the horse and
started. The glare on the horizon was grow-
ing larger every moment, and wider, and
redder, and the brigade realised the urgency
of the danger, and took a beeline over every-
thing. The old horse out of the dirt-cart
seemed to be endowed with human intelli-
gence and he flew through the gloom like a
spectral horse flying upon the wings of the
morning over a land of dreams. He tore
down the first slope at a reckless gallop, with
a dosr after him, and then he ploughed with
his Immense feet through a hedge, and
scraped off two of the company, and he nego-
tinted the rise beyond and fell at the top,
and kicked half the machine to splinters in
o-ettin- iin again and. when he got up,
crashed along for the next mile on three
i e£s fo r he was trying to scrape a clod off
hi! ear with the other one He hitched the
off hind wheel in a fence and carried it along
in his mad career, but presently the butcher
knocked off the encumbrance with an axe;
und then he found a long stretch of level
around before liim and pounded along with
the vigor of a horse that meant to gallop
through all eternity. Eight miles had been
covered and the fire was still ahead, and abofit
the middle of the ninth mile the whole machine
oot wrecked agaifist a tree, and the horse
went on alone. The chief of the brigade was
fired up among the branches with his hair
fill of and dead leaves and bark, and
the rest of the party was mostly impaled on
different parts (of the fence. They disen-
tangled themselves slowly and with a lot of
copious profanity, and held a meeting, partly
on the fence and partly in the ditch, and
resolved that, even though the engine was
a rule of dislocated iron by the roadside, and
its motive power was galloping for the dis-
t.nnt Pacific their honor required that they
should reach the conflagration or perish. But
iust at this moment the butcher burst into
choice execration, and cursed the fire and the
fire brigade and every separate and individ-
ual member thereof, together with liis father
and his mother and his grand-uncle and his
wife’s second cousin twice removed, and his
aunt in the country, and all his collateral
relations and their relations as well, and he
cursed the town and the surrounding district,

Dear Bulletin, — This is Bourke. I met
Bob the other day. Knew him at once. He
was foaming at the mouth, his eyes were
red and glaring, and his hair was all burnt
off his back by the sun. He knew me, too,
for as soon as he came into the bar he said,
“Hullo, Tremens; hot isn’t it?” “Yes,” I
said—-“hot even for Bourke ; you don’t _ get
112 deg. in the shade every day for eight
days, and I haven’t been out of this bar now
for eleven days for more than two hours at
a time.” He looked at me sharply and said
“Drinking?” “No, killing snakes,” I said.
“The blanky place swarms with them. There’s
one on you now.” I thought I heard him
laugh, but it was only a fellow in the corner
whom I didn’t know. He’d been sitting there
for a week knocking snakes off the counter
with a stick; This fellow now offered to
shout, but Bob said he’d sing first. They
argued it out, and I must have fallen asleep,
for I woke up with a start and heard Bob
singing “Oh! don’t you remember sweet Alice,
Ben” He stopped suddenly, with his eyes
fixed and staring with horror at the bar-
counter. We all looked. Sure enough, there was
the biggest snake I ever saw in my life, lying
full length along the counter. The fellow
in the corner was up in a moment, and made
a terrific whack at him with a stick. But
Bob was quicker. Seizing the snake in his
mouth like a flash, he had him on the floor
in an instant. Then took place one of the
strangest and fiercest fights I ever witnessed.
With one savage snap Bob would bite the
head clean off the snake, but immediately
another head would appear at the other end,
and all the time they were rolling over each
other, snapping and hissing like demons. The
row brought the landlord, who, seeing the
shindy and seeming to be used to such
scenes, seized a bottle of whisky and dropped
five drops into the snake’s mouth, killing
him instantly. This ended the trouble, but
it set the fellow in the corner going for the
rest of the day. Being so impressed by
what he had seen, he would do nothing else
but kill snakes by dropping whisky into their
mouths. This went on till all of a sudden
a death-adder put his head out of a bottle
and stared into his face. Hurriedly placing
the bottle on the floor, he resumed his seat
in the corner, but never for one instant did
he take his eyes off the bottle again. Bob
and I leave here to-morrow for the Never-
Never. —D. Tremens.
One morning not very long ago Mr. Waddle
O’Fat, a jolly, good-humored son of a gun,
who is loved by nearly everybody who knows
him —and who is there who doesn’t know
him?—was seated at breakfast at his resi-
dence at, let us say, Darling Point, when the
door-bell was rung and the pampered menial
(Mr. O’Fat’s acquaintances will readily
understand that his menials have a most
indulgent master) entered the room and pre-
sented the card of Mr. Aaron Snoozleberg,
the well-known Melbourne financier. “Snoozle-
berg ! Snoozleberg! Never heard of him!
ejaculated Mr. O'Fat. “However, show him
in, John, show him in.’’ And then the O 1' at.
fixing a large window-pane in his eye, gave
the visitor greeting. “To, what. Mr. ah—-
Snoozleberg, may I attribute the honor of
this early visit?” “Yell,” said the great
financier, “perhaps you don't know that I
haf hat very considerable transactions mit
your prother Tommy—beg pardon, I mean
your prother Mr. Thomas O’Fat. I hafe
never hat de bleasure of meeting you before,
but as I vas in Sytney I tought I vould like
to call und see you—l tought poshible. dot
you might visli to borrow a little monish.
“Oh,” replied Mr. O’Fat, “I don’t want any-
thing, thanks; I’m pretty flush just now,
thank Heaven. Won’t you have a drink?
“Veil, Mr. O’Fat,” replied the banker, “tank
you verv mooch, but I nefcr trink anyting
but zliainbagne.” “Well, we may be able to
find you a little of that. John, bring a
couple of pints of that dry wine you got in
last year—you like it dry. Mr. Snoozleberg i
Mr. S. certainly did, as fruity wine was, he
had always found, calculated to rather upset
a man in the morning; and so the fizz was
uncorked and poured down the respective
necks of the descendant of King Solomon
and his host. “By the way,” ejaculated the
O’Fat, as he began to feel the genial influence
of his share of the tipple, “what could you
do me, say, a couple of thousand for at four
months?” “I vill lend you two tousand for four
months for two huntret and dirty bounds.”
“Have you got the irons about you?” airily
inquired the O’Fat. Of course Mr. Snoozle-
berg had the irons about him—that’s why
he was there; he at once produced the
necessary stamped bill, which having been
signed and exchanged for Mr. Snoozleberg’s
cheque, the financier wished his genial enter-
tainer a very good morning. Three months
after this little occurrence the hand of mis-
fortune fell heavily upon the O’Fat, who had
to file his schedule, and in his list of liabil-
ities the name of Mr. Snoozleberg duly
figured for two thousand pounds. One day
just afterwards, the O’Fat’s lawyer ran up
against banker Snoozleberg in the street in
Melbourne. “Mein Gott!” whined the finan-
cier, “I vish I had nefer peen in Sytney. I
lent your glient O’Fat two tousand bounds,
and all I’ve kot for it has been one small
bottle of zhambagne.” When the lawyer
returned to Sydney he told O’Fat of Snoozle-
berg’s remark. “Look here, old man, ’ said
the O’Fat, “when next you see old Snoozle-
berg just tell him, with my compliments,
that I’ve still got a little of that wine left,
and if he likes I’ll let him have two or three
more bottles at the same price,
Some years ago during the prevalence of
a small-pox scare in Australia one of the
A. S. N. Co.’s steamers was crawling down
the coast bound for Sydney. Amongst the
passengers were two Chinamen, one of whom
was sick unto death with some undiagnosed
complaint. While life remained in the body
of the sick Chow his compatriot was assidu-
ous in his attentions, and diligently per-
formed certain weird rites considered essen-
tial to the keeping at bay of “dibble-dibble.”
But no' sooner had the sick Celestial drawn
his last breath than the mate, in true
Chinese fashion, gave the body a wide berth.
The captain was for .some time doubtful
whether he should keep the corpse for in-
questing at Sydney or heave it overboard.
There was a risk of censure if he did the
latter, while if he kept the corpse there was
a chance of the health officer at port boom-
ing the vaccination industry by a statement
that he was unable to say whether or not
the disease was .small-pox. ' After mature
reflection the gallant captain decided to let
the sharks do the post-mortem, and the old
quarter-master was directed to have the body
wrapped in a hammock and covered with a
Union Jack as a shroud. To the latter item
the salt strongly demurred. “Put the Union
Jack over a dead Chinaman, sir! I don’t
like to do it. It looks like tryin’ to insult
the flag. Please let me cover him with the
Blue Peter —the Blue Peter means ‘outward
bound.’ ” The quarter-master had his own

AUSTRALIA.
Dark rose her shore in seas of amethyst
By tropic breezes kissed,
A summer land in watery wastes forlorn,
Her ranges floating in the snow-white mist
And gold of early morn.
The tides of Empire ebbed and flowed afar;
The thrones of nations in the dust were
hurled.
Silent she .slept beneath the morning star,
A virgin world.
Love, Birth and Death, the stress of Age
and Race,
Cl"" 1 r j«d not her maiden face;
Unstocked her pastures and untilled her
soil.
She who for Labor builds a throne apace
Saw not her children toil;
Down the low valleys, up the stormy steeps,
Careless they roamed at will: the land
was free
From desert stark to where the mangrove
sleeps
Upon the sea.
There dropped no anchor at her river bars
Beneath the quiet stars;
No wandering sail her silent waters swept.
By waste and scrub, o’er plain and rocky
scars
No alien footstep crept.
In feather billows of her grassy seas
Some lonely mountain stretched its capes
of blue ;
Only the heavens above her and the breeze
Her secrets knew.
The ploughshare and the axe’s ringing stroke
That giant slumber broke.
She learnt the serfdom of a stronger sway,
She felt the dawn stir in her veins and
woke
To greet the larger day.
Her mighty solitudes and mountain chains
Flung wide their portals to the stranger’s
tread;
His flocks in thousands roamed her sunlit
plains—
The past was dead.
Where the wild grass grew rank on slopes
forlorn
Rise fields of yellow corn,
And purple lucerne bloom makes sweet
the air;
The sullen mountain, lost in mists of morn,
Its golden heart lay bare.
Spoils of her pastures crown full many a
mart;
Her glittering treasure calls to many a
land;
She has no secrets for the daring heart,
The strong brown hand.
The smoke and thunder of her cities rise
To the same careless skies;
Her arteries pierce the same wide sunlit
leas,
Her fleets stretch forth their wings of enter-
prise
O’er the same summer seas.
She to the nations cries: “No Past, no
Fame,
No Memories quicken round my flag un-
furled ;
The mightier, therefore, shall I carve my
name
Upon the world.”

ABORIGINALITIES
“Bad Australian”: Brown-Jones, of
Chandos Park, wasn’t a regular devotee of
Bacchus, but there were occasions when he
developed an insistent craving for something
more stimulating than water. As soon as
the preliminary symptoms appeared, he dis-
patched one of the hands to the general
store at Woolaway, eight miles distant, for a
case of dry sherry, his favorite lotion, and
went on a solitary jag for several days. On
one of these occasions, which had been
somewhat more protracted than usual, he
awoke after a late sitting and called for
the usual reviver, only to find that the foun-
tain had run dry. The station rouseabout
was sent off to Woolaway for a fresh supply
with instructions to “be dam’ nuick about
it.” He returned about an hour later, and
when he prised the lid off the case his
hyphenated boss staggered back as if it
contained a family of tiger-snakes. “You
blithering blue-blazing lunatic,” lie roared,
“what d’you mean by bringing me that
blasted muck?” “Well, Mister Jones,” ex-
plained the astonished rouseabout, “th’
bloke at th’ store sez they ain’t got enny
dried cherries, so I brung y’ them prunes
instid.”

“Tamraas”: MacPherson was standing at
the gate of the homestead when a meek-
looking youth carrying a bridle came up
and asked for a job. Mac was feeling in
the mood for frivolity and asked: “Can ye
ride?” “Ride anything,” said the youth.
Shouting to someone to bring up the chest-
nut, Mac took the newcomer down to the
yard and introduced the animal, as wicked
an outlaw as had been seen in those parts.
The youth mounted, hung on to the rearing
horse, and was presently through the gate.
“Stick to him, lad,” shouted old Mac. antici-
pating a fine entertainment. “Righto !” came
back as the chestnut flew over the paddock.
That was ten years ago, arid neither horse
nor rider has been seen since.

“O’Donohue”: “No,” said Dad, “there's
no snakes round here. All these snake-
yarns are just my foot. There’s Healy over
there, not a mile from our block, and accord-
ing to him he can’t pick up a log of wood
without finding a snake under it. Those
snakes must just sit round and wait for
H'ealy to pick them up. Here’s me been
on his block eight years, and I’ve seen
kangaroos, dingos, emus, ’possums, wild cats,
goannas, wallabies and rabbits, but never a
snake. Look at that blackboy swamp I
cleared last summer! Mean to say snakes
wouldn’t be there, if they were anywhere?
You take it from me the only snakes Healy
sees is when he is coming home after cash-
ing his cream-cheque at a pub.” A few morn-
ings later Dad went out to pick up some
kindling wood and something crawled slowly
over his bare foot. It was a carpet-snake
about 6ft. long and very prettily marked.
Dad let out one yell, and when the family
rushed out he had killed the crawler and
started to skin him. The same day he
found another carpet-snake down by. the
creek. By this time the whole family was
snake-mad. Mum wouldn’t make the beds
until night-time, being afraid that a snake
might make his bed between the blankets.
All the kids started to wear their best boots
all day. So when young Jimmy came into
say he had seen a brown tail disappear
under a pile of sleepers nobody believed
him, but as he was so positive Dad and
Bill went out and started heaving sleepers
about, and the other boys stood round with
sticks large enough to stun a bullock. Sure
enough out bounded a tiger-snake, his nasty
little head reared up fully lOin. off the
ground. He was game and showed fight,
but lie had no hope against those sticks.
Within a fortnight nine snakes of various
breeds had been killed, all within two chains
of the house. Dad and the boys did hardly
any work except snake-hunting and clearing
up round the house. They burnt up all the
old logs and every twig and bit of scrub.
SPEAKING FROM BITTER EXPERIENCE.
STRANGER: " Who’s the old gentleman? One of the early settlers, Jacky?”
JACKY: “No pfear. Him owe this poor pfeller tix tchillin' ’bout pfive year.”
When the mailman came to collect the
cream-cans he thought he had come to the
wrong place. And he went and put it all
round that we must be selling out, other-
wise we wouldn’t be cleaning up like that.
That was two years ago, and never a sign
of a snake have we seen since, though the
boys have never ceased to look for them.
BY ARRANGEMENT.
MRS. COGGS: “Would yer mind, visitin’ me ’usband, Mr. Splodget? He’s considerin'
dyin’.”
Bill reckons those snakes appeared just to
prove that Dad doesn’t know everything.
Dad thinks Healy knows something about it.
H'ealy doesn’t think—he knows!
“Assp” : The fact that Queensland has a
Government water-diviner, as recently noted,
doesn’t settle the question
whether water-divining is a
reliable business. Such evi-
dence as is available, even in
Queensland, points the other
way. Some years ago une
Primary Producers’ Union of
that State asked the Govern-
ment to make inquiries into
the use of the divining-rod.
The matter was referred to
the Water Conservation and
Irrigation Commission, wdiich
reported that of 56 bores sunk
with the aid of the divining-
rod 39 were successful and 17
were failures, and that of 96
bores sunk without the aid of
the divining-rod 84 were suc-
cessful and 12 were failures.
It is a pity that the Queens-
land Government has given the
water-divining superstition an
official status, as people may
be misled, with expensive re-
sults. Just one instance. A
settler in north-west N. S.
Wales acquired an additional
area of 1200 acres of land on
which there was no natural
water supply. A local water-
diviner claimed to have located
an underground stream of
water at a depth of 800 feet.
Boring was commenced on the
site selected by the diviner,
and a hole put down to a
depth of 1280 feet without
even striking moisture. Cost
amounted to over £lOOO, plus
the £2O paid to the diviner.
This experiment practically
mined the settler, and the
tragedy was that had less than
half the money expended on
boring been spent in making
surface excavations, an ample
water supply for all prac-
tical requirements could have been obtained.

“Arrabee”: The silence that had fallen
on the group sitting in the moonlight by the
door of the Mallee camp was broken by
a reminiscent chuckle from Jimmy. “Saw
Tom’s latest and best th’ other day,” he
said. “Was watchin’ him do a bit of fencin’
down on his 00-acre. He had the posts in
’n’ was borin’ ’em, and blue me if he didn’t
have tli’ little skewbald there, so’s he
wouldn’t have to walk between the posts.”
Old Dick, the stack-builder, didn’t join in
the laughter. “Nothin’ new in that dodge,”
he drawled. “Once up be Mansfield I saw
a bloke that used a ’orse on the job, but ’e
went one better. ’Ad a mong trained to carry
th’ brace. It wasn’t no terrier either,
but a ruddy big kangaroo dog, so’s to save
’im from too much bendin’.”

“Bouragi”: Australian papers have been
registering extreme horror because a party
of natives in Western Papua raided a village
and slew 17 of the inhabitants. It sounds
very dreadful at this distance, where people,
with rare exceptions, slay little but reputa-
tions, but there is something to be said
for the actors in the affair. Papua, as
far as the more primitive natives are con-
cerned, is rather boring. There are no Phar
Laps or Don Bradmans to discuss, no two-
up, no Mr. Lang to produce daily a new
lunacy. Raiding and fighting were the
Papuan’s perennial joys in the good old days,
and helped him to take a healthy interest
in life now often lacking. In this case, pent-
up feelings seem to have overflowed. Pro-
bably, in addition to the ennui which sits
heavy on the savage’s soul, there was a short-
age of fresh meat. Further, it is stated that
the raiders are a dirty and unkempt people,
while those they attacked are clean and law-
abiding. No Sydneysider needs to be told
that a basher gang needs no further incen-
tive to aggression. These ruddy boorjoice
were just asking for it.

“Plankton”: The remarkable blue coral
found on the Great Barrier Reef is so dif-
ferent from others that scientists originated
a special order to classify it. The hard
skeleton forms thick flattened branches and
is composed of beautiful crystals of calciur
carbonate. The outside of the coral is of
parallel tubes built up like honeycomb, and
when occupied by tiny living polyps is of a
rich brown color. Under the surface the
coral is of dazzling whiteness, but the
is of an intense blue. This pigment is
manent, and differs in composition from
other known to chemists.
SKY RABRITS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the dusty blue spreads over tiie sky,
The field of sky, where the fences arc
A pile of cloud in the paling west,
The twilight rabbits —each tail a star —
Come tumbling out of the gate, beyond
Where the bathing sun swims his golden
pond:
Little rabbits with shining scuts,
And big grey rabbits, that nibble there
At the silver flower of the rising moon,
Free of a million miles of air:
H'ow they scamper and how they play
Down the pearly banks of the Milky Way !
You may bring me books on astronomy,
Dry as dust, with their maps of Heaven;
There, you say, are Orion’s belt,
And the Pleiades that are sisters seven,
And the tilted cross that the pointers show
Over the brigalows, hanging low. . . .
But I snap my fingers at maps and books;
Ere Dawn halts her hack at the rose-red
rails,
God opens the door of the rabbit-hutch
And out they come with their starry tails;
Babbits little and rabbits great,
Whom twilight lets through her purple gate!

TO-DAY — TO-MORROW
Yesterday does not matter any more, but what you do to-day may
make or mar to-morrow. It is of no use repining about what should
have been done—it is what lies to our hands now that really counts.
To an extent contemplation of yesterday may help, for everyone made
mistakes then, especially the errors of omission. Whatever of hardship
or disappointment they may have brought they have at least pointed a
lesson for us. To-day, now, is the time to do things, and this applies

PROUD OF HER “CUT”!
DISREPUTABLE MONG: “Cripes, Lang took more'n 22½ per cent, off'n her.”
“By Gripes”: The depression has hit
semi-civilised Jaeky Jacky as hard as his
white brother. For years in Queensland
the big northern cattle stations have
employed a number of abo. stockmen under
the eye of the State Protector of Aborigines.
These were paid at a lower rate than, white
workers, but they made what was to them
good money, which was safeguarded by the
Protector. With the suspension of the State
rural awards, white workers were found in
plenty to take Jacky’s place at the same
rate of wages. Employers showed a pre-
ference for their own color, with the result
that it has been necessary to admit a number
of abo. workers into the reserves and settle-
ments.

“Jenny Lintott”: A journey through the
north-west and north of Australia discloses
a great deal of variation
in the ant-hills. Round
about Broome are the
cone-shaped hills of red
clay that Dampier and
the early Dutchmen took
to be the mud huts of
savage communities.
Fitzroy country is an
unending panorama of
grey slab tombstones,
gradually increasing in
size and irregularity till
they become like groups
of Rodin statuary, fan-
tastic and majestic in
outline. Over the Terri-
tory border these rise to
a stupendous height and
become fluted, in organ-
pipe formation. North-
ward of Pine Creek they
sometimes interfere with
the telegraph lines at 30
and 40 feet. Just south
of Darwin are the weird-
est of them all, known
as “magnetic ant-liills,” great wide grave-
yard slabs. All are built by white ants.

“A.M.”: We were camped in an old hut
on Beechal Creek, far-western Queensland,
a couple of darkies and myself —horse-
hunting. One morning I was awakened
just after daylight by a wrangle between
the aboriginals over a stirrup-iron they
had unearthed. “I bin find him first time,
boss,” the thin falsetto voice of Billy rose
appealingly. Mick stood sullenly _ aloof, pol-
ishing the stirrup-iron with a piece of old
moleskin. Billy was much the smaller of the
two, and I knew if I left it to a rough and
tumble Mick, thick set and sturdy, would
beat him. “Oh well,” I suggested, rub-
bing my chin wisely “better toss for it—
best two out of three!” They grinned, and
nodded approvingly. Mick won. I slipped
Bi]ly a piece of tobacco to even things.
As we rode back in the evening a ter-
rific thunderstorm overtook us on the
side of an ironbark ridge. There was scant
shelter. The metallic rattle of the thunder
and the incessant vivid glare of the light-
ning were almost continuous. The wind
rose to a shrill whistling hiss; the whoosh
and whir of flying leaves and branches
filled the air and littered the ground like a
brown-green mantle. We were chilled to
the skin, and drenched before we arrived at
the last gate. Mick reached it first, dragged
it open and held it. Driving our spurred
heels into the sides of the steaming horses,
we hurried through. Suddenly a blinding
flash of lightning lit up the whole ridge
like day. My horse plunged blindly, and
almost unseated me. I looked
back. Something dark lay in a
huddled heap against the gate.
A horse stood some yards away
ACCORDING TO TASTE.
“Remember Talltork, who used to tell yarns of adventures with cannibals?”
“I reckon you had to take old Talltork with a pinch of salt.”
“Yes, and that’s exactly how the cannibals did take him in the end.”
—legs apart, dazed and trembling. I hur-
ried back and dismounted. It was Mick.
He lay with his mouth wide open—dead.
The new stirrup-iron was melted into an
almost unrecognisable mass of metal, where
the lightning had struck. “By cripes, boss,”
gasped Billy, staring with dilated eyes at
the twisted stirrup-iron—“lucky I bin lose.”

“Hal”: One of the first things which
strike a newcomer in the U.S.A. is the fact
that most of the firewood cutting is done
with the old-style frame saw, or brick-saw,
as the Yanks call it. Where the Aussie bush-
dweller goes out to the woodheap and belts
away with the axe, the Yank puts the log
into the “saw-buck” and does the job a lot
quicker and with less expenditure of energy.
I have never been able to make out why
the average Aussie would rather use an
axe than a saw. I have often been laughed
at for going out to the woodheap with a
ripsaw when working on bush jobs in Aus-
tralia. My remarks usually lead to a bet
being laid, and the competition which follows
leaves me richer and the axeman wiser.
The French peasant, too, always prefers
the saw to the axe for firewood.

“Mako”: A N.S.W. grazier padlocked
the only gate into one of his paddocks
and took possession of the key.
Passing that way a few days later
he was astonished to find that there
was an occupant of the field, and
one that could by no possibility have
negotiated any fence. At rest in the
middle of the area was an ancient
motor-lorry. Asleep under a tar-
paulin were two battered indi-
viduals, who, on being awakened,
showed unmistakable evidence of an
overnight carousal. Asked how they
came to be in a locked field they
were as astounded as the questioner.
Tracks showed that the lorry had
entered via the near-by river, and
neighbors supplied the missing de-
tails, having the afternoon before
observed the lorry breaking records
on the hill leading to the river.
Apparently the inebriated couple
missed the bridge, and with the luck
of tlicir kind safely crashed
down one steep bank and lurched
up another, taking the shallow stream in
their stride. Why they stopped when and
where they did they couldn’t explain.

“Beachcomber”: One of the Sydney
beaches was the scene of a unique happen-
ing during the late storm —the rescuing of
wild swans by life-savers. The birds were
scared off a near-by lagoon and flew out to sea.
Forced back by the gale, they either became
exhausted or panic-stricken and settled in
the breakers. Awkward risers even from
smooth water they could not take the
air again, and were in bad plight in the
broken seas when the surfers, with
belts and lines, went to their rescue. The
swans were all but out when brought in,
but were given the usual resuscitation treat-
ment, including rubbing, wrapping in blan-
kets and dosing with brandy. This proved
effectual, and after an hour or so they were
taken to the lagoon and released.

“FY7”: The cables have told us of the
trial in England of a new Fokker 'plane
which flies tail foremost. The new con-
trivance cannot stall or go into a spin; if it
loses speed it simply sinks slowly to the
earth. As an old Western Queenslander
the story is interesting to me in view of the
legend attaching to the crows that frequent
the plains about Winton. There the
westerlies in winter are so strong and cold
that the crows are compelled to fly back-
wards to keep the tears out of their eyes and
so be able to see where they are going. I
have always been convinced that the story is
true, because I have heard it from many
citizens of Winton, a town, which has a high
regard for truth. Now this new plane
comes along to justify my faith.

“Bat”: Sydney zoologist T. C. Roughley
has deserted his beloved oysters for a while
to investigate an epidemic that is playing
havoc among goldfish—it is diagnosed as a
fungus disease. He was presented with a
very sick goldfish for experimental purposes.
When treatment commenced the fish had
apparently given up the ghost. For over
an hour the gills refused to function, but
Mr. Roughley inserted a pipe containing
oxygen into the aquarium and commenced
artificial, respiration. After some hours of
treatment the fish sprang up and took
notice, only to fall back groggily upon the
aquarium bed. Oxygen administration was
persisted with and progress developed as
follows: First day, goldfish gave sundry
flops and dashes, dying away to utter ex-
haustion. Second day, it swam round the
aquarium in a drunken manner, collapsed,
then unsuccessfully attempted to rise to the
surface, resulting in tail-spins. Third day,
goldfish gave a slow-motion exhibition -swim
with frequent staggers and struggles to
maintain altitude, finally coming down in
a full nose dive. Fourth day, goldfish, in
the phrase of lottery-director Whiddon,
“attained motherhood” ; gave birth, in short,
to thousands of sons and daughters. All were
doing well. Fifth day, after desperate en-
counter with fungus germs, Roughley saves
330 of the family. Sixth day. survivors
going strong and out of danger. Mother

TOM THE RAGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wonder if the ghosts of some hard cases
that one knew of old,
When men went battling up and down West-
ralia’s far-flung belt for gold,
Still hang around the fields they found, the
pubs they once supplied with biz.
And, if not there, I wonder where the shade
of Tom the Eager is.
Tom started on the Queensland side. The
middle ’eighties sent him west
To give the Kimberleys a trial and struggle
southwards with the rest.
He knapped and sank and toiled and drank.
And when or where he happened by
H'is sobriquet is hard to say, but none who
met him queried why.
He might have stayed obscure, unknown,
and raged unheeded, so to speak,
But for the lucky chance that brought his
pick a fortune at the Peak;
It brought him sundry lawsuits, too. There-
after, like a bursting bomb,
Where mined was gold, or drinks were sold,
rang out the rhetoric of Tom.
It wasn’t quite the “noble rage” starred in
that Elegy by Gray;
Withal a “genial current” ran through any-
thing that Tom might say.
And Bungs would grin when he came in,
knowing, the louder he inveighed,
More corks would pop whene’er he’d stop
for breath —and it was Thomas paid.
His wrongs and rights he would recite, and
wet them, too, with grogs and beers,
As long as there were listeners to lend him
sympathetic ears.
From Murchison to silver Swan were mighty
few, I will engage,
Who weren’t acquaint with what it meant
to hear old Tom the Rager rage.
Along the road the liquor flowed, when
Thomas came or went, in pails;
And left him still, for all he’d swill, as
tough as wire and hard as nails.
A social, droll and kindly soul, his leathery
face was seldom grim
Save when he’d close some fierce tirade with
an emphatic “Shtiffen him!”
left the stage so long he’d trod, I think,
some thirty years ago;
is bones may lie in Erin’s sod, or Yankee-
land, for all I know.
- td yet, if spooks return to nooks where
once they made things hum and whiz.
I’ll make a fair conjecture where tne ghost
of Tom the Eager is.

SHADOW SHOWS.
The main purpose of l Tliis Modern Age
(M -G -M ), at Sydney Plaza, is to give
Joan Crawford and Pauline Frederick oppor-
tunities to compete in emotionalism. . Miss
Frederick, as Joan’s mother is living in
gilded shame in Paris. She throws drunken
parties and members of the Ameiican colony
attend ’and more or less wreck the premises,
loan’s father, with whom she has been liv-
ing in the U.S.A., dies, and she turns up
at the flat. The gong goes for the first round,
so to speak, when Miss Frederick explains
to her lover that she is the mother of an
in-no-cent gy-url, and must act the part.
Joan falls in love with Neil Hamilton, who,
though he dresses like a gigolo, is a wowser,
and has parents who wouldn’t be seen dead
with her mother’s friends. He learns the
truth and she learns it from lnm. Misery
all round! She drives him loyally from her
life, and turns with wide, brave smiles and
a breaking heart to Monroe Owsley, who is
practically never sober. The mother, whose
heart is also breaking, promises to reform,
but shortly afterwards telephones her lover
and is seen returning from an assignation
by the despairing daughter. What can the
girl do but yield to the importunities of
Owsley ? She is revealed agonising in a bed-
sitting-room with him. Champagne is
opened. Suddenly Hamilton dashes in,
pushes the already blithered Owsley over,
seizes Joan and bears her to his car. And
there, smiling tearfully through the window,
her face irradiated with mother-love, is Miss
Frederick, a genuine reformee at last. Miss
Crawford the winner. She overacts, uses
her enormous eyes too much, exploits her
voluptuous figure in a manner that would
cause her to be misunderstood in any night
club • but she is restrained compared to
Miss’ Frederick, and her gestures are ot
the period. The other lady’s are stagey,
stereotyped, pre-war. All the men are. ex-
cellent, and the production is as slick as it is
lavish. T „ i
There is a first-class Laurel and Hardy
film on the bill.
Robert Sherwood’s “Waterloo Bridge”
(Universal), at Sydney Haymarket —unpad-
locked after a long spell—deals with prosti-
tution, but without the tragic intensity ot
“Susan Lennox” or the poignancy of
“Maya.” Beneath the sentimental gloss
there is little apparent but a desire to ex-
ploit a dirty subject. Myra, the prostitute
(Mae Clarke), graduates first as a chorus
girl, then as an artists’ model. On Water-,
100 Bridge she is met by Roy (Kent Doug-
lass), an 18-year-old Canadian soldier on his
first leave. Not suspecting her vocation he
befriends her, buys her food and escorts her
to her room. Roy, boyishly, speaks of his
home, and reveals himself as being almost
completely unaware of the. ways, of the
world. Myra determines not to disillusion
him. He takes Myra to his parents, who
are staying in London, and she is made one
of the family. Myra bolts back to London,
but the young man follows her, and, though
he has learned the truth, on the eve of his
return to the front he extracts from her a
promise that she will marry him, which
leaves the story in the air.

“Smart Woman” (Radio; Sydney Capi-
tol) repeats that any wife (Diary Astor
in this case) can recapture the affections ot
a straying hubby (Robert Ames) by pre-
tending to love another (John Halliday).
Ed Horton is comic relief—-and not always
a relief. According to the other film on the
bill, “Travelling Husbands” (Radio), Yankee
commercial travellers spend gay nights in
grand hotels with lingerie samples light
ladies (Evelyn Brent depicts one) and lash-
ings of booze. Such a party is raging when
Ben Hall (Carl Miller) molests Ellen
(Constance Cummings). .With him, a
stranger, she had been painting the town
puce. because her rich father refused to buy
her an aeroplane. Barry (Frank Albertson)
a youthful c.t., rushes to her rescue, and
Hall is shot. His wife is called ; the others
are detained until he is definitely dying. Then
Barry is arrested. At that stage Evelyn
Nobly Confesses. She tells Ben s wife he
was responsible for her state. This so
wrings the sympathetic creature s heart that,
when the detective announces that Ben is
recovering, she asks that Evelyn may go
free. Marriage is foreshadowed for Ellen
and Barry.

Svengali, Trilby of the perfect feet and
Billee and his Latin-quarter friends cast
their shadows on the Sydney Lyceum s screen
in First National’s talkie version of lrilby.
As Svengali, John Barrymore’s make-up

Trilby is played by a newcomer to the

Bramwell Fletcher strikes the right note as
Trilby’s temperamental little sweetheart.

Fox’s “Brat” is at Sydney Regent. A
novelist in search of local color (Allan
Dinehart) visits a police night court. He
p ays the fine of a girl who ate a restaurant
me al she couldn’t pay for (Sally O’Neil)
aD( j takes her home to his mother. He
commences a novel about her. She becomes
hi s devoted slave, taking it for granted they
are en gaged because he kissed her (and she
was j n the chorus before Depression set in,
too!). This amuses him, but not some of
his lady friends, also in the running for
his name. One slaps the girl and gets more
than she bargained for in response. Finally
the novelist does propose to the waif, but,
a ] as » s he now loves his young brother
(Frank Albertson). Sally O’Neil, in the
name part, mouths her words, mostly, slang,
as though they hurt her. Louise Mackintosh,
as a broken-down Shakspearean actress _ m
the court scene, is the best of a collection
of supporting characters.
“Cine Ma” : It is often asked why there
are no repertory film societies in. Australia
on the American and European models. In
those countries the artistic pictures of Ger-
man, French, Danish and English producers
with ideas instead of wool in their noddles
go the rounds of theatres run by people
with an objective interest in the drama. I
submit that the reason why there is no
similar movement in Australia is because
fine drama is mainly regarded as a golden
opportunity for a display of personal vanity.
Actors who have failed on the professional
stage blossom as producers and collect around
them callow youths and maidens with an
adolescent itch to tread the boards and drink
the nectar of applause. They make a mess
of Ibsen, O’Neill and Shaw and in return
get their names and photos, in the papers.
No such publicity would be provided by a
film repertory enterprise, since the perform-
ances as weil as the plays would, at least
in the beginning, be imported. An art cinema
will never come from the people at present
engaged in exploiting the demand for intel-
lectual drama. It will come from ordinary
intelligent playgoers with no private axe
to grind.

STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
WHEN SUPER. AND SOIL CLASH.
_ ~
“R. K. Deea : The reason way supei.
does not prove beneficial when top-dressed
on certain pasture soils may be s*>mewhat
technical, yet a knowledge of what happens
when the fertiliser is applied makes the
solution of the problem quite simple. Take
the chocolate-colored friable loams and
the liglit-grey silt loams which are fairly
common in the Vic. hill country. The for-
mer are rich in iron oxide (red ochre), and
their deficiency in lime and soluble Silica is
most pronounced. .When super “*PP“ ed
to soils of this description the so üble phos-
phoric acid of the fertiliser is dissolved in
the first shower of ram, is at once seized by
the iron oxide and is converted into insoluble
iron phosphate—speaking rurally, the worst
form of phosphoric acid. Through this bit
of business the lively part of the manure is
rendered inactive, at least for many years,
in such smls , .
As all soils contain more or less iron
oxide, my statement may be chaHenged The
answer is that the iron oxide in normal
soils occurs in combination, and, theretore
not being a free agent it caxmot enter into
a new affair without first throwing off the
shackles of the old. The simp in
express this important fact is to liken the
normal soil to a dead match, llie c
late soil containing free uncombined iron
oxide is the live match awaiting a chance
to be fired to enter into the combined oi
dead state. Soils of this type should be
top-dressed with 2cwt. of basic phosphate—
or bonedust. Agricultural lime? No, because
the amount required, the present price and
the value of the land place the matter out-
side thc boundary fence of economy.
As for thc light-grey silt loams which have
been found unresponsive to super., these
soils are, without _ exception, deficient in
lime, phosphoric acid, potash and nitrogen.
It follows that the phosphoric acid of the
super, cannot take the place of all three.
You might just as well top-dress the metal
road running past the front gate with super.
and expect good pasture to eventuate. In
cases of this description, treat the. soils with
lime in the early autumn, them super
(lewt.) three weeks later, and finish ott
with sulphate of ammonia (lewt.) in the
spring. The next year, cut out the ammonia
and lime and substitute potash in some
form. .
Of course, there are grazing soils which
do not respond to super., simply because
the season is not to their liking, borne soils
show such a poor nitrification in wet years
that no amount of super, will produce
results on the pasture, yet the same soil
in a good spring (having had an autumn
dressing of super.) is thc talk ot the ms-
trict. As a rule, there is no catch in
top-dressing pastures. If super, will not
play the game, and you cannot entice the
soil to behave, try (1) drainage, (2)
liming, or dressings of (3) sulphate of
ammonia, (4) bonedust, (5) potash. It is
only a matter of experiment and experience.

GREEN MANURING.
“S Smiire” • The advantages of plough-
ing in a green crop may be well known, but
the "practice—ill Victoria, at all eve At-
is not at all general. Many farmers are
too impatient to undertake a programme of
"Teen manuring • thev think soil improve-
ment hv these means' is too slow to show
results They are used to the quick results
eoTulition onri tvne o'f tlie soil The rotting
of weeds ‘and rubbish usually takes double
the time that a crop of, say, peas requires;
undei the bast conditions such a crop will
break down in 10 or 12 weeks. It is mainly
governed by tlie moisture content of the
soil and this in turn will depend upon
the’rainfall and/or irrigation. As a matter
of fact, without irrigation it is possible that
green maturing will produce a bad effect dur-
ing a dry period—for example, in the
orchard—in that the decomposing crop seizes
b/th/tm” th ° SOi ‘ *“* iS re9 " ired
The crop ploughed in on a sandy soil will
deeompose more readily than when ploughed
in on a heavy soil, all things being equal,
but over a period of years it is much safer
—in the absence of irrigation—to practise
green manuring on clay soils than on those
of lighter texture. Of course, for maximum
results, green manuring is essential on both
types of soil. A word of warning: Always
grow tlic crop with super, on top of a dress-
ing of chalk or agricultural lime. If you
are ploughing in the sod (rubbish or grass),
top-dress with lime on the ploughed surface.
Lime is essential in the process of decom-
position ; it also neutralises certain toxic
principles which arise.
SPREADING BURRS.
“Booraby”: A run quickly depreciates in
value where burrs are allowed to spread,
and heavy losses are incurred when the
tenacious seed gets into the wool. In north-
west N. S. Wales and farther inland bindies
are common, and these make shearing very
unpleasant; but the worst weed pests of
the sheepman are the Bathurst and Noogoora
burrs. The latter is the worse of the two
where it is allowed to spread; the burrs are
larger, and the hooked spines are stronger
and more tenacious, and therefore more
harmful to wool. The plant has broad leaves
—almost as wide as they are long—and
rough stems, with no spines in the forks of
the leaves. The Bathurst burr has narrower,
lance-shaped leaves, with spines in the forks.
In other countries they are known respec-
tively as cocklebur and spiny cocklebur.
Cattle are fond of Noogoora when it is
young, but it causes lioven or tympanites,
with sometimes fatal results. It flourishes
anywhere, from the eastern to the western
districts, growing in places, as along the
Peel River, to a height of Bft. Twelve
years back some of the western N.S.W.
stock routes were so choked with it that
lanes had to be cut through it to enable
stock to reach water.
The infested stock route is a danger to
all run-holders. These pest-nurseries are
nobody’s business but the Government’s
and the Government does notning. A horse
or a dog may carry the seed into clean
country hundreds and even thousands of
miles away. Travelling sheep that have
come through burr country are usually
watched carefully through clean runs, and
kept strictly within the limits of the stock
route where that route is a part of the run.
That precaution, however, does not ensure
immunity unless the country traversed is
frequently inspected for a good while after-
wards.
The main places to look for the intro-
duction of burrs are camping grounds, banks
of creeks and watering places. Wherever
a plant appears get it out at once; to allow
it to grow and seed is to sow trouble. \v hen
meeting a mob of sheep or cattle coming on
to the run, look carefully about them to
note if they are carrying anything that will
require their tracks to be subsequently
watched. Take notice also of the horses
and the woolly-coated dog; the horse with the
long tail and the dog are the worst carriers.
WHAT TO DO WITH BLACKBERRY.
If you live near a main road and the
berries are plentiful in season, you may, of
course, sell buckets of them to trippers; but
the return from berries is poor compared
with the economic waste caused by the
bushes. Where you have land for
sheep, young blackberry plants, the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture advises, can be
kept down by keeping a few crossbred
wethers or by running goats in the paddock.
In coastal districts Kikuyu grass can be
sown after burning as a means ot smothering
the suckers.
If, however, blackberry is well established
and eradication —or, at least, effective con-
trol —is aimed at, spraying is necessary ; that
and hoeing out young plants as soon as
they appear. According to the department
mentioned, the most effective spray is a 15
per cent, solution of sodium chlorate, 111 b.
per gallon of water. Spraying is best car-
ried out during the early summer months,
when the vines are making active growth; it
must be thorough, and through dense growth
a track must first be cut. Burn the plants
when they become dry. It may be neces-
sary to spray again about six or eight weeks
later to deal with second growth which
may be made from the roots.
“At the strength mefitioned,” the official
adviser says, “sodium chlorate is not poison-
ous to stock, but as there is a possibility
of stock obtaining an overdose by licking
the sprayed foliage, keep them out of the
affected paddock until the plants have been
washed by rains, and leave no unused spray
in places accessible to them.’’ Moreover,
sodium chlorate makes combustible materials
more combustible; so don’t prepare the stuff
inside sheds; “and if clothing becomes satu-
rated it should be thoroughly rinsed before
being allowed to dry. Leather and wood
also absorb the solution readily, and are not
easily cleansed; therefore, if l ar &® ■ 9^ an "
tides are being used it is preferable that
rubber boots be worn, and that the wood-
work of apparatus used be painted.
wheat production and prices.
“Tuart”: Arresting facts and figures were
given by A. J. Monger, chairman of trustees
of Westralia’s voluntary wheat pool, in dis-
cussing the pool’s dealings with ldoO-ol
wheat. Production for Australia amounted
to 213,000,000 bushels—our greatest wheat
harvest by far. N. S. Wales headed the
list with 65,511,000 bushels; then
came Victoria (53,814,000) and Westralia
(53,504,000). In export values, however,
Westralia led, “our wheat,” Mr. Monger
said, “being of exceptionally high quality,
whereas, owing to late rains, much of the
wheat of N. S. Wales and Victoria was
below our standard.” The farmers were
promised 4s. a bushel by the politicians.
Few of them will get more than 25.; the
great majority will not realise even that.
Westralian farmers put 24,160,000 bushels
into their pool, and it lias practically all
been sold. “As usual,” Mr. Monger states,
“the United Kingdom was our largest cus-
tomer, taking 7f million bushels. China
bought 6 millions, Japan 2$ ml
14 millions and India and Egypt 800,000 and
700,000 respectively. Other places to which
pool wheat was sold were Italy, £outh
Africa, the Levant, Holland and Malta, lhe
Chinese and Japanese purchases are inter-
esting in relation to recent military develop-
ments. Australian wheat beat _
American wheat out of the Asiatic field
until the U. S. Federal Farm Board sold
a huge quantity of its surplus to the
Chinese Government —or one ot the Chinese
Governments—on pay-when-you-can terms.
This is perhaps regarded in the U.S.A. as
a good stroke of business. To us in Aus-
tralia it looks very like what our Yake
Yoliansons and Yoe Schelleys call “sgab-
biug.”
A preliminary estimate of the 1931-32
harvest is 168,000,000 bushels, S. Aus. being-
placed on top with 45,000,000. No one
acquainted with the South Australians’ gal-
lant struggle with adversity will grudge
them this eminence if they achieve it. At the
moment the W.A. price is about 3s. a bushel
at siding (may it keep moving up!), with
the bonus of 44d. to be added. The banks
are behind the bonus, so the farmers will
get it; if it were merely another politicians’
promise it would fade into thin air.
World production in 1930-31, excluding
what was grown in China, where accurate
statistics are not kept, is estimated by Mr.
Monger at 4,700,000,000 bushels. The West-
ralian authority expects a decrease of
300,000,000 bushels for 1931-32. “This,”
he adds, “will be a step towards reducing
the burdensome surplus which has had such
a demoralising effect on prices. Owing to
the present chaos in world affairs it is im-
possible to attempt to forecast prices for
the coming season. The price of our wheat
has improved appreciably during the last
three weeks owing to "the devaluation of the
British pound, brought about by Great
Britain forsaking the gold standard. It
must not be expected that this rise will
continue; in fact, in view of the large stocks
of wheat still in the United States, and the
large Russian shipments in being and still
to come, it is possible that it may not be
permanent. Further, the benefit to Austra-
lian wlieatgrowers might be partly nullified
if there is a reduction in the Australian
exchange rate in sympathy with the fall in
value of the British pound sterling.”
Later reports from Europe and America
suggest that the shipments from Russia will
fall far short of rosy Soviet anticipations;
indeed, though the exact position has been
concealed, as usual, the Communist wheat
campaign has evidently suffered a decided
check. One “Boamata,” rebuking me for my
faith in “the little farm well tilled,” declared
in his cocksureness that “the Russians have
definitely brought wheat-growing within the
mass-production sphere” and that “be.fore
the Five-year Plan is complete ‘the little
farm well tilled’ will have as much chance
of competing with the giant co-operative
concern as has a back-yard workshop with
Ford’s factories.” I am still backing our
good farmers of the Wimmera, the Riverina,
Fergusson and Bruce Rock to beat the new
serfs and their Communist taskmasters.
POINTS IN WHEAT-CROP
COMPETITION.
The R.A.S. field championship of the
Western (N.S.W.) wheat districts has just
been awarded to L. J. Mathews, of Condo-
bolin. Eleven show societies were repre-
sented in the competition. Points were given
as follows: type and purity, 20; freedom
from disease, 30; evenness, 20; condition.
10; cleanliness, governed by the number of
crops grown on the land, from 24 points for
a first crop to 30 for a seventh crop or over ;
apparent yield, 1 point per bushel.
The winning wheats were: Nabawa, 5;
Waratah and Turvey, 2 each ; Yandilla King
and Penny, 1 each.
The maximum was nowhere scored tor
anything. But for freedom from disease
N abawa scored 29$ out of 30 once, 29 out
of 30 three times and 28 in the fifth case.
Turvey scored 29 once, but only 26 in the
other case; Penny, 28$; Yandilla King, 28;
Waratah, 25 and 28.
In points for type and purity Nabawa
also more than held its own: Nabawa
(out of the possible 20), 18$, 19, 19, 18 and
17 ; Waratah, 19 and 18$; Turvey, 17$ and
16; Penny, 18; Yandilla King, 14. But
for evenness Yandilla King and Penny were
as good as Nabawa; and the rest were well
behind these.
Coming to apparent yield, Nabawa (1)
and Yandilla King (1) promise 40 bushels;
Nabawa (1), Waratah (1) and Turvey
(1), 38 bushels; Penny (1), Waratah (1)
and Turvey (1), 36 bushels; Nabawa (1),
35; Nabawa (1), 34; Nabawa (1), 31.
It will be noticed that Federation was
not among the prize-winners. It may, how-
ever, have been among the prize-losers,
because it turned up in various places as a
stranger and lost the competitor a half-point
or so.
The competition was really the final of the
district competitions, in each of which there
was an average of about 40 entries. Many
sub-district competitions have also been held
by the local branches of the Agricultural
Bureau; in these Yandilla King seems to
show up better than it did in the big Western
competition.
PIG-FARMING IN QUEENSLAND.
“Bendee”: The statistics presented by
“Longo” (B. 11/11/’3l) are interesting, but
Queensland is looking for trouble when the
Government farms foster so many breeds
and the National Association encourages
these breeds by catering for them at the
Brisbane Exhibition. This year there were
10 breeds on show. Is it not a tragedy to
see a State, with overseas trade in view,
offering buyers a choice of 10 kinds of bacon
or pork? The Stock Branch could do a lot
in educating the farmers to concentrate on
one or two breeds that will supply the best
requirements of both producer and con-
sumer.
Duroc Jerseys, Gloucester Old Spots,
British Blacks, Chester Whites, Middle and
Small Yorks, could well be wiped right oft
the slate as unable to substantiate their
challenge to Berksliires, Tamworths and the
cross between these two breeds. Large
Yorks., essentially a heavy baco'n breed, are
excellent for that purpose, but are not suffi-
ciently mature for pork when at pork
wmights. And they are liable to scald in hot
districts. Poland-Chinas have a big follow-
ing, but they are apt to be too soft when
cured, and there is a fairly high percentage
of loss in evaporation and offal in the pro-
From experience, I believe that pigs will
reach the required weight more quickly in
Queensland, under similar treatment, than
in cither Victoria or N. S. Wales. Indeed,
Queensland will do big things in pork export
if the right type of pork is produced and it
it is kept to a definite standard.-
CURIOSITIES OF CROP DISEASES.
“Bee Knee”: “Noah Fraid” (B. 4/11/’3l)
evidently had an infestation of bacterial
blight in his bean crop. This trouble can
be carried over in the seed; “Noah Fraid s ’
was probably infected in the first place.
That the disease did not manifest itself in
subsequent crops grown from the same seed
may be attributable to either the death of the
bacteria through inability to function
or to seasonal conditions being unsuitable
for the blight to operate.
Diseases in crops are akin to plagues of
grasshoppers, mice, pneumonic influenza and
bubonic. They come and thrive when con-
ditions are favorable and run their course.
It is a curious fact that in many districts
where thrip is prevalent there is hardly
any sign of bronze wilt in tomatoes,
although it has been definitely proved that
thrip is one of the main means of infestation.
Last year in some of these districts,
although there was very little thrip, it was
nearly impossible to grow a tomato plant.
“Noah Fraid” is very lucky to be able to
carry bean seed to the second season. Weevil
generally riddles it if it is held over.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Wheat was quoted in S.A. at 2s. 6d. per
bushel on trucks at Port Adelaide or chief
shipping ports. In Vic. it was quoted 'at
close an 3s. Why the differencef —6607.
' These quotations are supposed to be of
prices fixed on f.o.b. parity, and from this
point of view prices “on trucks” Port Adel-
aide and “on trucks” Melbourne or Williams-
town are not comparable. The buyer “on
trucks” Williamstown has no other railway
charges to pay, whereas at Port Adelaide

there are shunting charges; also, in Mel-
bourne, no outward wharfage is charged
on wheat, whereas at Port Adelaide wharf-
age is charged. Again, port practices in
respect to handling from truck to ship
differ in different ports.
(1) What, should he used to clear crock
water which has been pumped into an over-
head tank of 1600 gallons capacity? (2)
Will the chemicals used be detrimental to
plant life ?■- —6404.
(1) If the water is muddy, use fib. of
alumina ferric. (2) No.
I have, on separate places in Q'land, a
herd of Hereford cattle and a herd of
Jerseys. I cannot procure locally suitable
stock in their respective breeds for the pur-
pose of introducing new blood into the herds.
What sort of a cross would a Hereford-
Jersey make?- —6712.
It is inadvisable to cross Hereford and
Jersey stock, as the resultant progeny will
deteriorate from meat- and milk-producing
standards. Strongly advise the introduc-
tion of suitable sires of the respective
breeds. Q’land State studs can supply.
(1) Is power alcohol made in Australia to
any extent? (2) Is it used commercially
and in ichat industries? (3) How could a
young man with small knowledge of indus-
trial chemistry set about learning the manu-
facture and uses of power alcohol? —6731.
(1) A distillery is operating at Sarina
(Q.). It has a capacity of about 1,000,000
gallons per annum, but it is understood not
to be operating at that capacity as yet. (2)
The motor fuel known as Shellkol contains
15 per cent. Power alcohol is really ethyl
alcohol, which is used industrially in the
form of methylated spirits. (3) A good
book is “Power Alcohol,” by Monier Wil-
liams. See also Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research Bulletin No. 33.
Can bananas be grown at Nyah W.
(Vic.) f—6381.
Climatic conditions and soil are quite un-
suitable. These fruits must be produced
in a hot, humid atmosphere with heavy rain-
fall, and in a deep, rich soil with an abund-
ance of humus.
(1) What are the prospects of the egg
export trade? Is it advisable to launch out
at present? (2) What area is required for
a one-man farm and number of birds? (3)
Length of time before returns can be ex-
pected, and approximate capital required for
buildings, etc., and to carry on until the
venture may be expected to become remu-
nerative (not including personal expenses)?
(4) Names of books on poultry raising, and
can I obtain information from any S.A.
Government department f—6662.
(1) For high-quality eggs prospects are
bright, and the present time appears oppor-
tune for commencing operations. (2) About
three acres, carrying 1200 to 1500 birds.
(3) Birds should begin to bring in returns
when six months old. In addition to the
cost of land, from £7OO to £BOO would be
necessary. (4) Laurie’s “Poultry Manual”
is recommended. Information can be had
from the Poultry Expert, Department of
Agriculture, Adelaide.
A simple means to find out the quantity
of salt contained in tallow, so as to avoid
using salty tallotv for soap-making? —67o2.
The source of supply should give an indi-
cation of the presence of salt. Tallow
obtained directly from the bones and bodies
of cattle and sheep rendered down ex-
pressly for tallow is considered to be free
of salt. Fats which are obtained from
kitchens, or as by-products of canning fac-
tories, are almost certain to contain salt,
and should be treated accordingly.
Recipes for (1) parsnip wine, (2) white-
wine vinegar? —66so.
(1) Scrub the parsnips quite clean and
cut into small pieces, or put through a
mincer with medium cutter. Allow 1 gallon
water for every gallon cut parsnips and
boil together till quite soft. Strain and
measure liquor. Allow 31b. cane sugar and
4oz. ginger-root to each gallon liquor. Boil
for half-hour, then strain into a clean tub,
not galvanised, and add 1 sliced lemon or
1 teaspoon tartaric acid to every gallon of
wine' As soon as the wine is tepid (it must
not be hot or cold) put in a slice of toast
spread with thick yeast. Allow it to stand
for a w*eek, then cask it for six months;
then bottle and cork well. (2) Place a quan-
tity of raisins in a stone jar or wooden
cask, cover them with water and add half-
cup of white vinegar or soured white wine
to every lib. raisins. Stir well, cover with
a cloth and leave in a warm room. The
vinegar will be ready for use in three weeks.
Strain into bottles and cork securely.
Is there available a hand-machine for
converting used binder-twine into rope? Its
approximate price and where procurable?
Description of process (if any) twine has to
be subjected to before being handled by
rope-making machine ? —6532.
What is required is a small hand-operated
rope-laying jack, the main principle of which
is two wheels revolving in opposite direc-
tions. Don’t know where you could get one
in Australia. Used binder-twine would re-
quire to be teased out, and respun into yarn
before laying out into a rope. A rope suit-
able for rough farm work may be made by
tying the twine or splicing it before laying
out into rope.
Has the charcoal-gas producer any advan-
tages over the wood-gas producer for motor-
lorries and motor-boats? —6633.
Little difference in the quality of gas, but
the engine power obtained from a given
weight of charcoal is more than from an
equal weight of wood. From 141 b. to 161 b.
of charcoal or 201 b. to 221 b. wood have a
fuel value equivalent to 1 gallon of petrol.
Which is the near side, and which the
off side, of a horse; also of a tractor or
plough, etc., and why? —676B.
The near side is the left-hand side looking
towards the animal’s head; the term rose
out of the fact that it is the nearest to- the
mounting rider. The off side is the right-hand
one. The terms are applied to ploughs
and all horse- or cattle-drawn vehicles and
implements. There is no rule in reference to
tractors or motor-driven vehicles.
HINTS FOH THE FARM.
“Mimosa”: Having blistered hundreds of
horses, I say this—never blister a single
leg- If you have to blister a near fore do
the off fore, and the same with the bind
legs: it relieves the tension to blister both.
Horses generally break down in the sound
leg by trying to save the unsound one. But
you mustn't blister all four legs at the
same time. Before blistering, and while the
blister is working, keep the horse well
mashed with bran, and let him exercise him-
self.
“The Breaker”: If Dobbin does not eat
all his feed and starts to lose condition, the
fault is probably with his teeth. A vet. will
attend to them; if he's too expensive, borrow
a gag—some cocky in the district is sure to
have one —and after fixing it run your
fingers along the grinders. If they are rough
and jagged, they need rasping. The work
can be done by any novice as long as a good
rasp is used and care and time are taken.
Once Dobbin’s teeth arc levelled off, he'll
come on to his tucker again.
“Albert P.”: After years of experience
with lime, I have found oxide (burnt
builder's lime, finely ground) the cheap-
est, and 6cwt. to the acre gives the best
results. For a truckload of 10 tons at 505.,
I pay £25; bags (16 to the ton) cost £2 10s.;
rail freight comes to £2 10s.; cartage from
rail to farm, £1 10s.; and the cost of spread-
ing 6cwt. per acre is £s—a total of £36 10s.
Ten tons of oxide is equal to 18 tons of
carbonate, and 18 tons of carbonate,
together with the other charges mentioned,
works out at £36 15s.
“Yarri”: A simple way of bridging a nar-
row, boggy gully that is no more than about
4ft. deep is to roll a hollow log into it, then
tip in stone and gravel on each side and over
the log to the level of the banks. The log
will carry the'water through, and the level-
crossing will be a convenience in all
weathers.
“Ilomby”: Don’t let your grindstone stand
out in the weather, which wears it away
rapidly. A shelter composed of four sap-
ling uprights, a few crosspieces, a roof of
opened-out kero.-tins (or old bags greased)
and bough sides amply repays construction.
If your stone shows signs of becoming lop-
sided change the handle to the other side;
this, done once a month or so, will keep the
surface level. And don’t forget axle-grease;
it saves elbow-grease.
_ “J.S.V.”: Ricegrowers on the Murrum-
bidgee irrigation areas are missing a chance
of profit from their stubble fields. In Cali-
fornia turkey-raisers pay well for after-
harvest. grazing rights in rice fields; and
the Californian classes the turkey topped
off on rice as the finest. The export of tur-
keys to the U.S.A. is an established business
already. The high cost of beef, mutton and
pork in west-coast cities, coupled with their
people’s intense regard for dietetics, makes
the chicken or turkey dinner as common
there as our grilled steak is here.
“Y”: When joining merino rams with
ewes saturate the head about the base of
the horns with a well-bodied fly-dressing.
In the mating season the rams fight like
blazes, and the fly does the rest. Try this
plan, and you will have a lot less trouble
from fly attack and a higher percentage of
lambs.
“Valerin”: Unlike the Westralian Agri-
cultural Department (B. 4/11/’3l), N.S.W.
charges high prices for seed-wheat grown
on experiment farms. The policy dis-
courages many small growers from procur-
ing pure seed, and these are the men who
should use it. Reliable seed of approved
varieties is the only means of increasing our
average yield, which is nothing to boast of
in N. S. Wales.
“6QJ”: “Esau” (B. 11/11/’3l) will get
a better emulsion with his soap-kerosene
spray if he uses boiling water with the soap,
and when adding the kerosene uses an ordi-
nary hand spray-pump to do the mixing.
With plenty of force, the pump will churn
up the mixture much better than a stick
and with a lot less labor. The emulsion
should not be very strong, for tender plants
like young cabbages. If a weak solution is
used, young plants may be dipped in it when
transplanting to destroy pests that may have
infested seedlings in the seed-beds.
“Floodmark”: When fear of bush-fires
renders the burning of hollow logs unsafe,
and rabbits are using them for cover, try
this way of catching the pest. Take a
straight piece of No. 8 wire, damp it at
one end and shove that end up the log till
it touches bunny. By twisting the wire you
can get a firm hold of the animal, till finally
it is pulled out of the log and destroyed.
“L’Fou” : A good road to the farm is not
enough. What about the roads on the farm?
Sometimes it’s more effort to get to the
homestead from the gate than to the town-
ship. A bit of culvert over a casual creek,
a few days spent crowning up and draining
the track will pay a labor-saving dividend.
Especially in hilly country are a well-graded
siding and regular measures to prevent
erosiou worth while. When laying out an
orchard or cultivation, plan the road by
which the produce will be carted out. Do
not have your paddocks so that you travel
a mile when a half would do. If you need
more gates, get them. You can fix up a
gate in a day, while the extra travelling may
run into many days each year.
“Cooramin”; A good way of stopping a
travelling swarm of bees is with a hand
mirror. Get the bees between the glass and
the sun, and flash the light just in front
of them. That will cause the swarm to swing
round ; then play the light over and round
it till it is brought down.
’ “Friar Tuck”: Nauru rock ground for
fertiliser is quoted at £7 ss. per ton in my
part of Queensland; specially finely-ground
for stock, £7 15s. Nauru phosphates are
suitable for our poorer coastal lands, which
are deficient in lime, and represent nearly
one-half of most stock licks used in Queens-
land. If the rock can be landed at 435. 9d.
per ton, as Mr. Williams (B. 4/11/’3l)
asserts, it would be more to the point to
look nearer home to find one of the causes
of the high cost of production. I have seen
ground lime quoted at 255. per ton in Vic-
toria; the price is £3 2s. 6d. per ton in Bris-
bane, or £2 15s. per ton by the truckload
at works near Gympie. The prices are
nevertheless below those fixed by the price-
fixing commissioner.

Are special stamps issued in Thursday,
Norfolk and Lord Howe islands?— 66os.
Before Federation N.S.W. stamps were
used in Lord Howe Island, Q’land stamps
in Thursday Island and N.S/YV. an d Tas.
stamps in Norfolk Island. Since 1913 all
three islands have employed Commonwealth
stamps, and their place of origin can only
be ascertained by the postal cancellation.
The only exception is in the case of Lord
Howe Island, which in August, 1930, ran
out of 2d. stamps owing to the increase in
postal rates. To overcome this difficulty
the postmaster surcharged a small number
of Australian Commonwealth Sturts
with the inscription “2d. paid PAL, L.H.1.,

v:eek. Must she now reduce the rent again
by 4s. 6d.? —6584.
The rent is subject to the reduction. Ihe
law takes no cognisance of any reductions
prior to June 30 of this year, and in this
case there was no actual reduction, the higher
rate never having been applied.
How to combat the grub which eats the
centres out of asters and destroys snap-
dragons? Also the stalk-rot which attacks
both of these plants? —6634.
Spray once a week with a solution made
from a teaspoon of arsenate of lead, a little
soap and one gallon of water. Emulsify well
during use. The stalk-rot can be stopped
by cutting down the supply of water, and if
the soil is heavy by adding a big proportion
of sand.
(1) Is sun-bathing good for T.B.t (2)
Does it affect the heart? (3) Is lying down
or walking in the sun best? (4) Should
long exposure be avoided? —67l6.
(1) Yes; within certain limits. (2) No.
(3) The body should be introduced to the
sun gradually. Even after some time it is
sometimes not wise to expose the whole
body. Walking about is better than lying
down, so long as your condition does not for-
bid exercise. (4) Depends on the person.

dendrobiums have recently been placet
under protection by the Q’land Government.
(1) Method of removing sun-cracked
paint from a pine wall in preparing foi
repainting? (2) Would a caustic-soda mix-
ture be effective? If so, what should be its
constitution ? —6683. ...

for Federal Parliament? (2). Is it neces-
sary to be nominated, and, if so, is either sex
permitted to do so? (3) Can a person living
in one State nominate for an electorate m
another State? —6694.
(11 He (or she) must be 21 or more, a sub-
ject of the King, either natural born or for
at least five years naturalised, a resident
within the Commonwealth for at least three
years, and an elector entitled to an

at least six electors for the division con-
cerned. A candidate may be of either sex.
(3) Yes.

be placed on his return. If his disease
is of an infectious nature detention and
treatment might be necessary under the pro-
visions of the Quarantine Act.
(1) How 'can the speed of nervous re-
sponse be improved? (2) Is it affected by
mental or physical fatigue?—6 64B.

(1) I am an accountancy student, 21,
Intermediate standard, prepared to pay a
premium up to £5O for permanent position
in public, accountant’s office in Melb. What
are my chances of employment? (2) Are
there any legal obligations entailed or arbi-
tration awards affecting such an agreement?
(3) Would an advertisement in one of the
daily papers be the _ best means of securing
such a position? —6681.
(1) It is unlikely that the offer of £5O
would attract any reputable accountant. (2)
Clerks and accountants’ offices are under the
Commercial Clerks’ Award. (3) Might pio-
duce some result.
(1) Which is the most suitable milk for
a delicate baby, that of a mare or a cow,
and why? (2) Has an American medical
man ever advocated the use of mare’s milk
for such a purpose? (3) Is goat’s milk
more nourishing than either? 6669.
(1) Cow’s milk, “humanised,” according
to the Truby King formula. (2) Don’t
know of an American authority, but Furo-
pean and English doctors have recommended
it as a temporary measure, as it has a suit-
able protein percentage for feeding delicate
babies, but the fat percentage is danger-
ously low; also it has a laxative effect, (o)
Goat’s milk has a tougher curd than cow’s
milk or mare’s milk, and is thus less suit-
able for babies. It does not keep well, and
has a strong flavor. It requires humanising
before being fit for a baby, Avhether delicate
or not.
A bank holds the title-deeds of a mort-
gaged property belonging to a friend of mine.
I want to pay off the mortgage. (1) What
will be the cost of the transfer of the deeds
to me? Is there a set scale? (2) Is an lOH
legally binding, and would you advise accept-
ance of 0ne? —6960.
(1) The bank probably holds the deeds
as an equitable mortgage, the property re-
maining in the owner’s name. No convey-
ance can therefore be made to you by the
bank. When the overdraft, presuming it
to be such, is discharged, the deeds will be
handed back to your friend, who may then
convey the property to you. Stamp duty is
payable on the value of the property, and
legal charges are adjusted accordingly. (2)
An lOU is a mere acknowledgment of a
debt and has no legal force.
I am a radio-dealer. Twelve months ago
a client left a radio set for me to repair,
which I did. He has not returned for his
set. Can I sell it, deduct repair and storage
charges and keep the balance aside for him?
If that is not legal, what can I do? — 6473.
Your common-law rights in the matter are
that you have a “particular lien” over the
set, and can retain it till the owner has paid
for repairs. If you sell it you may have to
stand a. claim from the owner.

very high qualifications are likely to gain
appointments. (4) Provided an applicant has
obtained the Intermediate certificate, includ-
ing in this the subject of physics, and he is
between the ages of 18 and as at the
time of entry, he need have no other special
qualifications. All specialist subjects are
taught to the selected candidate after he is
appointed. Selection is purely on merit.

ALIEN CORN
By G.M. Turnbull
Synopsis : During the absence of Jim
Huntley, Resident Magistrate of
Aikoroa, Papua, on sick leave, the
natives get out of hand. Returning,
Huntley gives them twelve days to
pay their taxes. Going on to Nataroa
Plantation he delivers a letter to<
the dipsomaniacal owner, Charlie
Durrant, on whom Huntley suspects
Roger Calvert, trader, is battening.- It
is from Marian, Durrant’s young
daughter, whom Huntley met on ship-
board and has fallen in love with. It
tells her father that, as he had always
put her off when she wrote of return-
ing from ‘'down south,” where she had
been brought up, she is paying him a
surprise visit. This news plunges
Durrant, who had “gone native,” into
despairing remorse. Bringing him to
the residency, Huntley grimly fights to
reclaim him for Marian’s sake.
Marian arrives in the Maipua from
Baramata, where she teas delayed;
but Huntley has Durrant sober, and
she does not suspect his terrible weak-
ness. The dilapidated house at
Nataroa is burnt down-—accidentally,
Marian believes, but really by Freddie
Chisholm, Huntley’s young assistant
and her friend. She too is invited to
live at the residency. The twelve
days have passed. Huntley, with
Gibara only, disarms the Aikoroans
and arrests Maragi the sorcerer.
Humiliated, he is allowed to escape;
Huntley cannot get the natives to
testify that he and Calvert, for their
mutual profit, caused this outbreak.
Arriving with the police detachment,
Chisholm has only to collect the tax.
Huntley tells himself he is just
Marian’s good friend —it is Chisholm
she loves.
CHAPTER XVI ( Continued ).
THE varying interests and activities of
the Government station absorbed
Marian—the police patrols, moving
out in the early flush of dawn under the
command of a very serious-faced and com-
petent-looking Freddie, to return, days later,
herding tax-evaders and other petty offend-
ers; the convict labor gangs, saluting Hunt-
ley most punctiliously, making it clear that,
although he was the author of all their
tribulations, they yet held him in high
esteem. To the brown-skinned, clamorous
station kiddies she soon became the original
of all “great white sinabadas.” Out of trade
print she fashioned sketchy garments to
cover the unashamed nakedness of Gibara’s
tiny sons. Fat, complacent Loa showed
her betel-blackened teeth and chuckled
hugely. Sergeant Gibara became Marian’s
devoted slave.
Mysterious packages arrived from Bara-
mata. The purr of a sewing-machine was
heard on Huntley’s verandah. He was
amused—and more than & little awed. The
bare barn that was the residency took on
an aspect extraordinarily homelike. Gay
chintz curtains appeared, soft cushions,
strewn rugs, mats and a dozen and one
little comforts , and trifles with which your
true woman of the Outback delights to sur-
round herself.
Sometimes Huntley took her by whale-
boat to Nataroa, there to watch the frame-
work of her new home grow stick by stick
out of the seemingly purposeless accumula-
tion of jungle materials stacked on the
site. Once the desolation of fire-blackened
ruins had been removed and the skeleton
was erected, her father and his laborers
hastened with feverish energy to complete
the house. It was astonishing with what
speed they worked; it was a revelation to
watch the natives’ nimble brown fingers
cunningly plaiting cocoanut matting for the
partitions, sago-spathes for the weather walls
and nipa thatching for the roof. Marian
began to look forward to these excursions
to her new home; to listen for Huntley’s
cheery hail as he passed the residency on
his way to the landing.
“Nataroa to-day, Marian! Care to come
along? You would? Run along then and
powder your nose—and for the Lord’s sake
wear a sensible hat!”
Then to glide along on the placid surface
of the lagoon propelled by a dozen brawny
convict rowers; to watch the reflected image
of the sky float by, or gaze enrapt, on the
mysterious life in the fairy-coral grottoes
fathoms below. There were giant clams
masking their deadly three-toothed shells
under a waving fringe of quivering
antennae; shoals of brilliant, many-hued
parrot-fish feeding on the living coral; huge
crayfish, murderously spiked, lurking in the
crannies and thrusting forth trembling
feelers as sensitive as nerves.
Here was a great sea-anemone stretching
out a tangle of golden threads that seethed
with life; here a yard-long sea slug—the
trepang of the South Seas—in search of
which many a white man died horribly in
the bad old days of murder and rapine, that
the flames of youth might be kindled anew
in the veins of fat Chinamen made old by
foul living.
A _ sensuous content took possession of
Marian as hypnotically she stared into the
emerald and translucent depths. There were
shimmering courts of seaweed, gorgeously
hued, delicate as butterflies’ wings; floating
jellyflsh glowing with primary color;
coral battlements, fantastically crenellated,
stippled indigo and mauve and emerald as
shafts of sunlight, piercing the shallows,
touched them with a magic wand. Now a
school of porpoises frolicked abeam, toss-
ing up a mist of golden rain as they leapt
and dived; now, as the sun glinted on the
bronze-gold carapace of a hawk’s-bill turtle,
the creature lifted its snake-like head and
dived in a swirl of bubbles.
And always to the left was the bone-white
beach fringed by the luscious shadow of the
jungle. Scarlet-crested waders, with long
delicate feet, raced a.t the water’s-edge ;
kingfishers prinked their brilliant plumage;
parrakeets circled and dipped above the
treetops, and high overhead were the black
shapes, of the frigate-birds, motionless,
menacing, sinister, waiting for some hapless
flying-fish to leap from the sea—to its
death.
Marian had but few words for Jim Hunt-
ley on these too-short journeys to Nataroa.
Admiration held her dumb; beauty trium-
phant held her spellbound. The city she
had left seemed very far away; no echoes
of its clamors nor hints of its unceasing
conflicts reached her here. Here time itself
stood still and puny humans were things of
no account. . The spell of New Guinea in-
vaded her; its witchery uplifted her; and,
for a space at least, she ceased to wonder
that white men, having lived the life New
Guinea offers, discovered in it the only life
to live.
Huntley was engaged in the notoriously
exasperating business of holding a Court
for Native Matters. Within his office the
heat was intense, the atmosphere oppressive
beyond words. Huntley sat and sweated,
mopping his clammy face with a towel
from time to time. For an eternity, it
seemed, he had been counselling litigants
who didn’t know what they wanted;
cautioning witnesses whose sole desire
seemed to bear testimony that would be
pleasing to the “Gavamani”; testing this
evidence, rejecting that, patiently winnow-
ing the grain of truth from the chaff of
falsehood, concentrating his fagged mind
on the job in hand, and praying that his
sense of humor would not desert him.
He had committed Dohugu the killer to
stand his trial at a higher court, had lec-
tured Kadoa the village constable and dis-
missed him from his high office. A village
Lothario had been sentenced to hard labor
lest the injured husband should resort to
the age-old, custom-sanctioned law of the
club. The matrimonial misadventures of a
woebegone bridegroom whose wife had
gone back to mother” had been investi-
gated with patience and care, lest the lady’s
return might be hastened at the point of
spear; and long-standing, inter-village
differences had been amicably adjusted
which, in the old days, would have been
settled only by the clash of spears, the
twang of bowstrings and the clamor and
carnage of tribal war.
Now he was hopelessly enmeshed in one
of those interminable, insoluble civil actions
concerning the disputed ownership of a
j 3l ?’ heat kept him in a continual
trickle of sweat; he was becoming fretful
.1 umpy, irritable, and the interpreter was
inconceivably stupid. Even Gibara, whose
duty it was merely to summon the witnesses,
pei formed his office in a voice unpleasantly
vitriolic. Knowing with certainty that both
parties to the suit were lying with fluency
and fervor, and that he was no Solomon
Huntley flogged his jaded brain for some
solution, while the oily voice of the inter-
preter became a maddening exasperation,
and desire to boot him into the compound
was a temptation not to be endured.
Then a voice from the outer office—
Chisholms room—arrested his attention;
a smooth voice, a shade too precise, too
clipped, with an undernote of too-intrusive
sibilants.
You will accept a cheque for the Signing-
on’ fees?”
Chisholm murmured something in-
audible.
“Nonsense, my dear fellow! It is, on the
contrary, quite usual. Quite. If you are
not careful, my young friend, your regard
for regulation will become an obsession and
everybody will hate you like Hell.”
Abruptly Huntley adjourned court. The
natives filed out, chattering excitedly, and
Huntley strolled into Chisholm’s room.
On the back verandah twenty brawny,
glossy-skinned savages were lined up. They
wore gaudy Turkey-red twill loincloths ;
sticks of trade tobacco were thrust through
their pierced ear-lobes, jew’s-harps and tin
whistles were much in evidence. They were
plantation laborers newly-recruited and
going through the formality of being
“signed-on.”
Huntley threw Calvert a distant nod.
“Mr. Calvert’s cheque is good, Chisholm,”
he remarked. He flicked a careless glance
at the recruits. “A likely looking crowd!
Calvert. Where are they for? Baramata?”
Calvert’s lips drew back from his teeth.
His swarthy features twisted into a grin,
and with a handkerchief he flicked an im-
aginary speck from his boots.
“Baramata is right, Huntley. I hope your
offsider’s ignorance of usual procedure does
not cause me to lose the tide.”
Huntley said nothing. Chisholm colored.
He was regarding Calvert with undisguised
distaste. There was a purple stain on Chis-
holm’s nose, a spot of oil on his cuff, sweat
was trickling into his eyes; his fingers rested
on the keys of a very ancient typewriter
and there wa.s a heap of uncompleted labor
contracts on the table by his side.
“Before you go, Calvert, I’d like a word
with you,” Huntley said.
Calvert moved his shoulders ever so
slightly. He looked at Huntley with an
expression of mingled superciliousness and
suspicion.
“Important?”
“Very,” Huntley returned with emphasis.
For a second they eyed each other with
polite hostility.
“Then,” Calvert drawled imperturbably,
“if you’ll persuade your side-kicker here to
get a move on, I may be able to spare you
half an hour or so. This,” he added, “is
one of my busy days.”
CHAPTER XVII.
Five minutes later Calvert sauntered
into Huntley’s office. His air was jaunty
and his smile held something of amused
condescension.
“I beg that you’ll be brief, Huntley,”
he began in a faintly patronising tone.
“I’ve already wasted half the morning with
that young whippersnapper in there”—he
jerked his head towards Chisholm’s room
—“and I wish to get away to Baramata
without any further loss of time. What is
it that’s biting you now?”
Huntley sat imperturbable behind his
table. He was balancing a flat, tapa-
covered packet in his hand. He regarded
Calvert with a peculiar smile.
“There have been some very curious hap-
penings in this division during the last
couple of months,” he said.
“Yes?” Calvert replied noncommittally.
“You might be interested if I gave you
a short account of the things that have
been—er—troubling me.”
“Not a bit, Huntley,” Calvert cheerfully
replied. “Frankly, it would bore me to
tears.”
Huntley smiled. Then his lips tightened.
“Then I’ll put it very straight to you,
my lad,” he grimly declared: “If you knew
how close you’ve been to a five-year stretch
you’d be astonished.”
“How interesting!” Calvert grinned at
him. “I wish I could understand just
exactly what you’re driving at. I really
do.”
He hitched up his scrupulously creased
trousers, sat down and planted his feet on
Huntley’s table.
“I have no proof,” Huntley resumed in
a matter of fact voice, “or, perhaps, I
should say I haven’t corroborated evidence
sufficiently conclusive to satisfy the Court.”
Calvert’s laugh was irritatingly mocking;
but he abandoned his somewhat negligent
attitude and his expression was suddenly
attentive.
“And yet I know,” Huntley concluded.
“Very clever of you, Huntley,” Calvert
sneered; “but I’m still in the dark. What
the devil are you getting at? What is it
that you know?”
“For one thing, that you’re an infernally
clever swine,” Huntley informed him with
unchanged imperturbability. “For another,
that you’re damned lucky. Don’t inter-
rupt me”—he raised a deprecating hand as
Calvert would have spoken. “I know also
that, assisted by—l suppose Maragi could
be described as your father-in-law ?—you
deliberately fomented and brought about
the recent upheaval at Aikoroa; I know
that for months past the people have been
selling their copra to you for cash.”
“Is there any law against that?”
“I wish you wouldn’t interrupt, Calvert,”
Huntley chided him patiently. “I know
also that the natives have been blewing the
proceeds of their copra sales over your
counter, squandering their money on all
sorts of useless junk, and that you have
profited immensely.”
“Damn it, Huntley, it’s a free country,
isn’t it? Can’t the niggers do what they
like with their money?”
“Certainly,” Huntley admitted—“after
they have fulfilled their obligations under
the Native Taxation Ordinance, that is.”
He paused. “I know also how you were
able to bluff the poor devils—and my col-
league Boardman.”
Calvert began to chuckle. “Forgive, me,
Huntley. I have never been a suspected
person before. Isn’t it your duty now to
warn me that anything I may say may—er
—what’s the jargon you fellows employ?
—be used in evidence against me?”
Huntley looked pained. “I’m a poor
sportsman, I suppose; but when I’m licked
I know it, and I'm quite willing to admit
it. You’ve been too shrewd for me, Cal-
vert.”
Calvert’s swarthy face turned a shade
darker. He trembled slightly.
‘‘l’m trying hard to keep my temper,
Huntley,” he burst out viciously. “I recog-
nise that you’ve been a sick man, and
that you’re not altogether responsible for
these extraordinary delusions that have
taken possession of your mind.” He
laughed—an ugly little laugh. “They let
you out of hospital too soon. A couple of
weeks longer in dock would have done you
all the good in the world.”
Huntley surveyed him steadily.
“The man who goes out of his way to
teach black men to defy the white man’s
law is an utter swine, Calvert.” His voice
was thick with disgust. “And it is no
credit to you that the division is not pay-
ing for your rottenness in blood. Don’t
waste time denying your share in the busi-
ness, man. I know.”
Calvert gave a little gasp; something of
his self-possession deserted him. “Confound
you, Huntley!” he flared. “How dare you
make such a preposterous accusation.
You’re crazy.”
For answer Huntley held up the tapa-
covered packet. “I’ll take your receipt
for this, and you may return it to its
owner,” he said evenly. “It belongs to
Maragi. You blundered badly, Calvert,
when you paid him in brand-new one-pound
notes for scaring the natives. It was a
blunder Calvert, that damn near put you
behind the bars.”
Calvert’s agitation was unmistakable. For
a second he became as something fright-
ened, hunted; then, with an effort, he
mastered himself.
“I repeat, Huntley, that I don’t know
what the devil you’re drivelling about,” he
muttered.
Huntley stared fixedly at him for several
moments. Apprehension leapt into Cal-
vert’s eyes; nervously he wet his lips.
“Don’t be distressed, Calvert,” the other
comforted; “I’ve already admitted that I’m
holding a bobtailed flush. There’s no need
to get the breeze up. Here—catch!”
The tapa-covered packet fell at Calvert’s
feet. He eyed it fearfully, his lips com-
pressed, but he made no attempt to pick
it up.
“By great good luck I was able to put
Maragi of the One Eye to shame the other
day. In the presence of his dupes, too,”
Huntley remarked reflectively. “Unfortu-
nately the poor devils believed implicitly
in that bunk he circulated at your sugges-
tion.”
Calvert found his voice. “It’s a damned
lie!” he shouted.
“And no reasoning on my part could
shake their belief, and so I gave up the
attempt,” Huntley smiled amicably at
Calvert. “It’s a perfect curse the way
judges and juries make a fetich of sworn
corroborated evidence, isn’t it? Still, you
put through a very clever little piece of
roguery, Calvert. I give you that!”
Calvert jumped to his feet. He was
seething with anger.
“It’s a lie!” he raved. “You—you crazy
fool!”
Huntley shook his head in mild impati-
ence.
“I’ve been trying to catch you, Calvert,”
he declared softly, “because I think you’ve
done something abominable. Personally.
I haven’t the least doubt that if ever a
man has been guilty of what the Criminal
Code calls sedition, you are that man.
However, I’ve failed, and we’ll let it go
at that.”
He rose as he spoke and leaned forward
with his hands on the table in a negligent
attitude. .
“My business with you is concluded. I
fancy,” he said. “It is the end of the
month and I’m in rather a rush. Good
morning.”
Calvert slammed on his helmet and flung
towards the door.
“You’re too smart,” he snarled, “too
damned smart, by half.”
Huntley shrugged. “I am entirely in
accord with you,” he admitted. “One
moment!” he added gently. “You’ve for-
gotten your father-in-law’s wallet. Better
pay him the wages he has earned, you
know.”
He came round the table, picked up the
packet and stuffed it into Calvert’s breast
pocket.
“It contains twenty quid in notes,” he
stated pleasantly. “I have a record of
their numbers.”
Calvert pulled up. He was silent for a
long half minute; then he sat down again.”
“Go on, Huntley,” he said thickly. “Tell
me the rest, and be damned to you!”
There was a thin smile on Huntley’s
lips. “By the way, Calvert,” he remarked,
“I must ask you not to give credit to my
police. It’s bad for ’em; makes ’em extra-
vagant and careless in money matters.
Besides, they are debts that cannot be
recovered.”
“Go on!” Calvert rapped out. “I can
conduct my business without any assist-
ance from you.”
“They’re paid quarterly, you know— the
police,” Huntley continued. He spoke medi-
tatively, as if more to himself than to
Calvert. “I can’t say, from memory, how
many non-commissioned officers and men
there are on the strength.”
“I’ve had enough of this nonsense,” Cal-
vert’s voice sounded squeaky. “What

to the out-stations by registered mail. Must
be a maddeningly monotonous job, Cal-
vert, typing out the serial numbers of
hundreds of notes!”
Calvert was on his feet with a sudden
half-stifled exclamation.
Huntley laughed at him. “Another of
your blunders, my friend,” he said. “Every
one of those notes with which you bribed
your charming father-in-law was disbursed
to the police by Boardman last pay day.
The sergeant holds your receipt for his
store bill—Ahagi, Bamori and half a dozen
more.”
Calvert’s dark skin was a shade paler.
He was pulling at his chin with quick,
twitching fingers.
“And I’ve no case,” Huntley concluded
regretfully, “because of the threat of the
unseen, the unknown and unknowable that
crushes the hearts of these wretched natives
at the mere mention of pourri-pourri. Your
luck has been in, Calvert; but I can’t
help feeling that if you were put to it to
explain how those notes came into Maragi’s
possession” He left the sentence un-
finished. “I needn’t detain you, Calvert.
Once more, good morning.”
He had resumed his seat and had reached
for a pen, when the uncertain clicking of
Chisholm’s typewriter in the adj oining room
abruptly ceased. There was an unexpected
sound of voices. Huntley frowned.
Calvert, who was already over the thres-
hold, checked his hurried stride. He wheeled
and his glance slanted furtively at Huntley.
Huntley waved a dismissing hand, but Cal-
vert took no heed. His expression had
changed to one of profound, secret amuse-
ment. He leaned with elaborate non-
chalance against the doorpost, flicked out
a scented handkerchief, and winked know-
ingly, confidentially at Huntley.
There was a soft knock at the communi-
cating door and almost immediately it was
opened. Huntley hesitated, but only for
a second; then he stood up as Marian
Durrant entered. She held a letter in her
hand.
“I know you’re a tremendously busy
person, Jim,” she began. “But” She
checked herself, and threw a half-doubting
glance in Calvert’s direction. Calvert
straightened himself.
Marian’s eyes, bewildered and a little
uncertain, sought Huntley’s. A flush of
color stained her cheeks. The tension in
the air was appai-ent, the subtle antagonism
between the two men was evident. The
situation seemed to shout itself. Marian
felt that she had unwarrantably intruded
upon a situation that was unpleasant.
Quickly she recovered her poise.
“I’m frightfully sorry, Jim. Freddie tried
to tell me that you were engaged, but I’m
afraid I didn’t listen to him very intently.”
“Not at all, Marian,” Huntley declared.
He hastened to offer her a chair, motioning
to Calvert to take himself off.
Calvert gave him a quick, derisive side-
glance, and his shoulders moved in an
almost imperceptible shrug. His mocking
eyes flickered to Marian and came back to
Huntley with a gleam of intensified malice.
He seemed very much amused.
“Another time, Jim. Do forgive me,”
Marian waved the chair aside. Her eyes
met Huntley’s in a straight, brief glance.
“It is of no importance, really. Daddy
lias sent a letter from Nataroa addressed
to”—she looked at the letter in her hand
—“to a Mr. Roger Calvert, and I haven’t
the foggiest notion who he is nor where I
am to find him.”
Calvert smiled with a flash of white
teeth. “Perhaps”
“This is Mr. Calvert, Marian,” Huntley
said.
Marian gave a slight start. There was,
now, something familiar in Calvert’s fea-
tures; a vague association she could not for
the moment identify. Nor could she mis-
take the expression on Huntley’s face as he
made the introduction. It was watchful,
distrusting enmity.
Calvert bowed from the hips—a deep,
ceremonious bow of exaggerated homage.
He moistened his lips eagerly.
“And you are Charlie’s daughter, of
course,” he exclaimed. His voice had a
smooth purring quality that made Huntley
writhe. “I should have recognised you any-
where, Miss Durrant—from your photo-
graphs at Nataroa, you know.” He bowed
again from the waist. “I am delighted to
meet you in the flesh, Miss Durrant. Your
father and I are more than friends—we are
mates in the truest acceptance of the
word.”
He came a little closer and Marian sud-
denly felt her hand clasped in his. She
looked doubtfully at Huntley. He was
standing in an attitude of polite inatten-
tion. He did not move, nor did his face
express anything, now; but his eyes were
flinty.
“How do you do, Mr. Calvert,” Marian
heard herself saying. She was unpleasantly
aware of a penetrating odor of scent hang-
ing about this self-styled friend of her
father; she was aware that his manners were
too showy, his voice too sympathetic, too
persuasive. She felt uncomfortable, dis-
turbed in a vague, indefinable way, and for
her life she could not meet Huntley’s eyes.
For a moment Marian and Calvert stood
looking at each other. Then Calvert took
the envelope, murmured a polite apology
and opened the flap.
Marian examined him with one swift
critical stare as he read the letter. He
looked up for a second and regarded her
with an odd intentness of gaze. There was
admiration undisguised in the smile he flashed
at her. It was the smile, the leer rather,
that lifted before her an instant mental pic-
ture of the hotel dining-room at Baramata
—of the scented, flashy, sleek-haired person
who w r as trying now so hard to impress her.
She was vividly conscious of him; of his
obviousness, his flamboyant pretentiousness,
his inherent vulgarities. Unconsciously she
tilted her chin combatively, unaware that
she was looking at him with cool disdain.
Calvert folded up the letter and placed
it carefully in his coat pocket. His manner
expressed quiet enjoyment of a jest to which
only he was privy. The glance that inter-
cepted Marian’s was subtly eloquent.
Quite definitely, Marian decided that she
did not like Mr. Roger Calvert.
“Really, Miss Durrant,” Calvert spoke
with an air of familiar confidence, “I am
delighted to make your acquaintance —at
last. I have heard a great deal about you
in the last few years. Your dad is one of
my oldest friends. He confides in me as in
no other man. And, quite apart from that,
we are—er —associated in a business way.”
He laid a hand for a moment on Marian’s
arm. Marian’s chin went up, and in her
eyes there was a sudden snap of fire.
“I think, dear Miss Marian, that we shall
get on very well together.”
Huntley’s snort was clearly audible. His
face was very red. At any other time his
mental writhings would have moved Marian
to laughter. Now, oddly, unaccountably,
deep down in her heart there lurked a
phantasmal doubt, a secret little fear the
more potent for being nameless. In her
wildest imaginings she could not perceive in
Calvert the sort of man with whom her
father would be likely to be intimate. She
began to wish that he would go; that he
would not stand there smirking at her,
enveloping her with his avid, predatory
gaze.
“However,” Calvert went on, “our good
Huntley has a whole world of responsibility
upon his shoulders these days. I feel that
I have taken up far too much of his valu-
able time.” There was a note of jocular
malice in his voice Marian did not miss.
He tapped his breast pocket where her
father’s letter reposed.
“Please tell the dad not to worry in the
slightest degree. He may leave everything
to me. I shall drop in and see him—see
you both, in fact—just as soon as I return
from Baramata.”
Marian gave an uncomprehending nod.
Calvert was seemingly oblivious of the chal-
lenging frigidity of her manner towards him.
She turned, surrendering to a not altogether
dignified impulse to retreat to Freddie’s
room. But Calvert, anticipating her
thoughts, was already at the door, his hand
on the knob, bowing most elegantly.
“Au revoir, Miss Durrant,” he purred;
“please give my regards to the dad.”
He. followed her with his eyes, frowning
a little as he saw her perch herself on
Chisholm’s table, swinging a slim, silk-clad
leg and rectifying the ravages of the sun-
gods with the aid of a powder-puff. He
intercepted a furious glance from Chisholm,
smiled urbanely upon him and softly closed
the door.
“Jolly little girl—Marian,” he nonchal-
antly remarked to Huntley. “Curious that
she should have butted in at just that”—-
“D’you mind,” Huntley cut in icily, “if
we do not discuss Miss Durrant?”
He made a gesture of exasperation. His
voice changed, stiffened. “What the devil
is there between you and Charlie Durrant?”
he demanded.
Calvert said nothing for a moment. A
faint smile —sly, secretive, malicious—
played upon his face as though some
thought, wholly pleasing, was passing
through his mind.
“Really, my good Sherlock Holmes,” he
sniggered, “you must forgive my amuse-
ment, you really must. You know so much
that I’m amazed at you” He broke off,
laughing unpleasantly.
A little breath came quickly through
Huntley’s teeth. His fingers drummed on
the table. His face twitched with an anger
he could not quite control.
“I gave you a warning at Baramata,” he
said quietly. “For your health’s sake, Cal-
vert, I’ll repeat it. I warned you to”
“To keep off the grass, if my memory is
not at fault,” Calvert coolly interrupted.
His eyes narrowed, a shadow of speculation
came into them; then he nodded and
chuckled softly.
“You poor fish, Huntley! Don’t you
know, and must I tell you that every
damned palm at Nataroa belongs to me?
That the house you burned down the other
day was my house? That every rag Dur-
rant’s kid has to her back was bought on
my say-so with my money? Every damned
gewgaw she wears, Huntley, every trinket,
even the expensive powder she dusts on her
haughty little nose, were all paid for by
me?” His voice was a snarl, his face
venomous. “And you’re the high and
mighty fellow who presumes to bounce me,
orders me to keep off the grass— me! You
poor, sickening mug!”
He went out leaving Jim Huntley staring
stupidly after him. It was very still in
the compound. A random breeze drifted
through the open windows, playing on
Huntley’s face, cooling the air. It lifted
a paper from the table and deposited it on
the floor.
Huntley turned and went back to his
seat.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Poitrel cannot be accounted a successful
stallion; yet his progeny win decent races
at intervals. Lampra, whose last previous
victory was achieved on January 26, bobbed
up in the middle-distance Armadale Handi-
cap at Caulfield on Saturday. She had
revealed signs of returning form, and was
sent out equal favorite with the Woodend
Cup winner, Lord Essex. Lord Essex had
to put up a 7lb. penalty ; nevertheless, shrewd
judges who saw him romp home at Wood-
end expected him to repeat the achievement.
After being well in the picture up to a fur-
long from home he faded out, and Lampra
scored very easily from Prince Don and
Glenanton. Lampra’s dam, Visibility, was
bred by “Scobie” Mackinnon, of the V.R.C.
committee, and is by Trafalgar from Clarissa
(imp.). She belongs to P. F. Hogan, the
racecourse caterer.
Because of heavy rain overnight and in
the early morning, Second Wind was with-
drawn from the race which Lampra cap-
tured. Another course scratching was
that of Mira Donna, who had gained third
honors at Williamstown. The consistent
and untiring Glenanton stood his ground.
If he had not lost lengths through being
bumped at the start, Glenanton probably
would have landed first money, as he came
from nowhere to run third. The St. Antons
have not been noted for stamina; yet Glen-
anton is one of the most useful middle-dis-
tance horses in training. He worthily upheld

Cup meeting. Lifted to 8.11, he literally
romped home in the Stansmore Two-year-
old at Caulfield. When he took Liberal in
hand, Fred Foulsham reckoned that he had
got hold of another Mollison. In addition
to owning this fine colt, A. G. Hunter has
Windbag at his Seymour stud.
Bob Inkson is acknowledged to be the
most accomplished jumping jockey in Vic-
toria. His victory on Rakwool in the Grand
National .Steeplechase brought Inkson boldly
into the limelight and Melbourne punters
follow him as loyally as they used to sup-
port Tom Corrigan, Mick Mooney, Fred Burn
and Boyd in days gone by. Inkson rode
Spear King in the Ivasouka Hurdle and
Bang Bang in the Tara Steeplechase at
Caulfield last Saturday. Each horse started
favorite at 3 to 1. Spear King is owned by
the trainer of Prince Dayton, who was
runner-up to Denis Boy in the Caulfield Cup.
He looked a winner up to a certain point,
hut faded out of a place. Bang Bang, a
stable mate of Spear King, struck his colors
to Arcadius. Four years ago Arcadius had
the Australian Hurdle won when he fell at
the last flight of battens, little more than a
furlong from home. The Honorious gelding
is now owned by Les Duff, who had the
great good fortune to capture (with Seafit)
the race in which Arcadius fell. From one
cause or another Arcadius was out of com-
mission for a good while, and ultimately his
attention was turned to steeplechasing.' In
the new role he has not been conspicuously
successful, and odds of 14 to 1 were on offer
against him on Saturday. He swerved over
to the rails, in front of Bang Bang, in the
straight, and a protest was entered for
crossing. This did not affect the result.
Jack Holt’s followers fell in heavily when
Hellenist, backed down to 7 to 4, failed to
finish nearer than third in the Ormond
Stakes, and they sustained another blow
over the downfall of Umbertana in the Ross-
town Plate. His record shows that Umber-
tana never has acquitted himself well on a
heavy track. Watch this horse for summer
.sprint races, such as the Standish Handi-
cap at Flemington on New Year’s Day.

Horses for courses! Ivillarney is one
of the oldest nags racing about Sydney, but
he retains his form marvellously, and if the
track suits him the distance doesn’t seem
to matter. He has always shown a liking
for the Warwick Farm track, with its
sharp turns. Topweight in the Varroville
Handicap at the Farm on Saturday, and
spiritedly supported at 5 to 1, Ivillarney came
with a fine run at the right end and cut
down Hunt the Slipper and Accepted, who
were followed by well-backed horses in
Remora and Sunlit Reef. The clock recorded
lmin. ISfsec. —good time for the day, there
having been heavy rain.
Another old stager in First Acre (9 to 2),
owned and trained by A. D. Webster and
ridden by his son, captured the Homcbush
Handicap. First Acre is by Acre (a son
of Dinacre, sire of Mistico and many other
good horses) out of Oka. He has been
racing for eight seasons and it is difficult to
believe that he has not seen his best day;
yet, carrying 9st. in a handicap with a 6st.
71b. minimum, he proved too good for
the cattle opposed to him, the best of which,
at the weights, were Queensland-bred
Soulton, to whom First Acre conceded
231 b., and the erratic Exact. Kelso with-
drew Loquacious, relying on Flinders, who
never gave his backers hope at any stage,
......
The crowd at Warwick Farm was so poor
that the A.J.C. committee, which is com-
posed of shrewd men, has probably arrived
at the conviction that the tariff must come
down. A.J.C. and Warwick Farm prices are
really smaller than those charged at some
of the proprietary courses ; but the amateur
club gives stakes. Warwick Farm
still lacks the win and place totes which
have proved so attractive at Randwick.
Punters who go in for doubles should also
be catered for, and an expensive machine is
not immediately required; numbered tickets
and a blackboard, with the necessary clerks,
would suffice for a long time to come,

Pliar Lap, first in the hearts of his coun-
trymen, with Don Bradman a close second,
has departed overseas. His ultimate destina-
tion is America, but it is probable he will
do the journey in stages, with rests in Maori-
land and Papeete. Arrived in America, he
is to go to Agua Caliente, in Mexico, where
Coffroth holds his annual race meeting,
which includes the Agua Caliente Handicap
worth 120,000. The track there is of rolled
dirt, like many others on the American side
of the border, and how the Australian, accus-
tomed as he is to the turf tracks of this
country, will shape on the unaccustomed
going remains to be seen. Up to the date
of leaving Australia, Phar Lap had won
156,450, easily a record for Australia and
M.L. If he can get away with the big
Mexican event, his figures will be close
to a world’s best.

C. F. Orr, dead in Melbourne at 85, was
one of Victoria’s best-known racing men,
having been for many years connected with
the Williamstown club, of which he became
a member in 1871. Wifh the late H. P.
Sutton, he did the club yeoman service as
a member of the committee and later as
chairman, a post he held for a long period.
He succeeded Sutton as secretary until
the late 11. L. Hosier was appointed, when
he took over the treasurership of the club.
He was a member of both the V.R.C. and
the V.A.T.C. and was a familiar figure at
all the big meetings.

Queensland’s Commissioner of Police re-
commends the licensing of betting shops
as the lesser of two evils, saying that bet-
ting cannot he suppressed by any police
force in the world, also that licensing, with
a tax on turnover, would bring in a bit of
revenue. But a swarm of small fry wouldn’t
take out licenses, and the police would
still have to pursue them. Before taking the
Commissioner’s advice, if it is inclined that
way, the Government ought to arrange
with the Q.T.C. to withhold “the weights”
for one or two of its meetings from the
newspapers, restricting publication to books
sold within the racecourse gates. That
would settle Mcßook’s lihsh as nothing else
can, and it would be strange if attendances
and tote receipts did not increase.

O. H. Hocker, whose death in Brisbane at
61 is reported, was one of Queensland’s best-
known racing officials, having been asso-
ciated with racing at Albion Park ever since
the late Abel Hyde’s day. He became secre-
tary of tbe Albion Park, Ipswich and Sand-
gate clubs when these were acquired by
the Wren interests some years ago. Later,
when the Brisbane Amateur Turf Club was
formed, Messrs. Hocker and Deady were
taken over with the clubs, one as secretary
and the other as liandicapper. Both men
died within a few weeks of each other.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Although Jim Jeffries (12.3) and “Tiny”
Allen (11.13) are not rated as headliners,
they proved that heavyweights provide the
real thrills in boxing when they clashed at
Leichhardt. Allen was the better boxer,
Jeffries the harder hitter. Jeffries
.stopped his man in five rounds. The two
10-rounders saw Joe Poland (10.6) win
over Melbourne Jack Egan (10.9) in
three, and Bill Kelly (9.6) knock George
-Roberts (9.4) in the second. Westralian
Phil Sullivan (9.12) gained a narrow deci-
sion over Bobby Stone (10.1) in the chief
battle on Saturday.
* * * *
Victorian Bert Malcolm (9.12) and Maori-
lander Jack Paul (10.1) failed to furnish
thrills in their bout at Rushcutter’s Bay on
Saturday night, although this was not Paul’s
fault. The Dominion lad dealt out much
more punishment than his foe, but Malcolm
did the cleverer work, and he was declared
winner. The decision favoring Billy
Cooper (9.2) over Young Heeney (9.0) .in
the 10-rounder met with a hostile reception,
and an attempt was made to assault the
referee after he retired from the ring.

The sudden death in Brisbane of Frans
Thorn removes a featherweight who might
have been a world-beater but for his unusu-
ally short arms. Born at Gawler, in South
Australia, in 1883, he was apprenticeu as a
jockey, but soon deserted the saddle for the
ring. As a boxer, he began in the bare-
knuckle class, his first fight being with one
McCoy at Kalgoorlie in 1898. Thorn win-
ning in 32 rounds. In his time Thorn held
the feather-, light- and welter-weight cham-
pionships, and was unquestionably one of the
best ringmen this country has produced.
Nearly 20 years ago he settled in Brisbane
as a boxing and athletic instructor, making
periodical visits to the ring until his retire-
ment some years later.
The Ins and Outs
Rain made play impossible on the open-
ing day of the Queensland-South African
match on Brisbane Cricket Ground, but a
start was made on Saturday, Queensland
electing to bat on an easy wicket. The open-
ing batsmen, with the exception of Higgins
(25), failed badly, and 7 wickets were down
for 56. G. Cook and Ilurwood then made a
good stand, until Cook went for a useful
29. Abo. Gilbert held his end up for
16 and helped Ilurwood to carry his score
to 89. This is the Australian Eleven bowler’s
best innings in big cricket and came in very
handy for his side. Lefthanders Vincent
(5-59) and Quinn (3-51) did the bowling
damage, but both had to thank Van der
Merwe. Making his first appearance in
Australia, the little ’keeper caught three
batsmen and stumped one. The South
Africans opened very carefully to Gilbert
and Ilurwood. The abo.’s delivery was un-
questioned, but he took no wickets. Thur-
low got rid of two good batsmen in Mitchell
(8) and Dalton (0), and he had dismissed
another when 5 were down for 142.

The selection of the Australian team for
the first Test against South Africa in Bris-
bane this week has given general satisfaction
save to the usual N.S.W. conscientous
objectors, who consider the Ma State should
have seven more men in. Woodfull is skipper
and Ponsford, Ironmonger and Rigg (12th
man) go with him from Yarraville. Bradman,
Kippax, Oldfield and McCabe are the Welsh-
men, while Grimmett, Wall and Nitschke,
the last a very popular pick, come from
South Australia. Ron Oxen ham is the sole
Queenslander. One would have liked to
see the new Victorian fast bowler, Mc-
Cormick, given a trial. In his two first-
class matches this season he has taken 18
wickets, a good showing for a trundler new
to big cricket. Still, the bowling is good
with plenty of variety, and will need to be
good against the Cameron clan. v

The first open golf championship of
N.S.W.—which for some reason or another
the golfing authorities persist in calling a
“close” handicap—resulted in a triple tie,
Howard, Gray and Richardson each return-
ing a card of 303. In the play-off over 36
holes, Gray beat Howard by one stroke,
after a stiff struggle. Gray’s rounds were
70 and 77 and Howard’s 73 and 75. Richard-
son, with a first round of 80, picked up in
the second. Gray, now professional at
North Brighton club, w 7 ent to America some
years ago with Tommy East, and picked up
a lot of useful experience there.

“Fitzcrav”: Australian cricket followers
will be glad to hear that Allsopp has
migrated to Melbourne, where he will play
with Richmond, which has found him a job.
AUsopp made a stir in his first season m
N.S.W. cricket, when he averaged over 46
i dis per innings. Stuck up-country at
Leeton. he was unable to get practice against
good bowlers on grass wickets, and after a
failure or two was dropped incontinently by
the N.S W. selectors, although a. first-class
batsman in the making and a fair keeper.
He should improve out of knowledge in
Melbourne, and will probably be seen one of
these days walloping the bowling of the
State which gave him the cold shoulder it
also handed out to Grimmett and many
another who later got their chance in other
States. , * *
If they made a bad showing for three-
fourths of the match against South Africa,
the Ma Staters piled up 430 for .three
wickets on the last day and got within IS
runs of the tourists’ score before stumps
made a draw of the game. Bradman played a
splendid innings for 135 marred only by an
easy chance in the slips when 124. I ingle-
ton, after a careful opening, gave a most
attractive display, winding up with a hum-
cane finish before he was caught at deep
mid-on for 117. McCabe’s 79 was brilliant.
The Afrikander bowlers stuck to their jobs
on the blazing day with infinite grit. Morsel
took all three wickets for SO.

badly, Ponsford following his first-innings

(32) again came to light with a useful
score, and Oakley batted attractively for

“Tenth Slip” : The decision of the N.S.W.
cricketer Fairfax to accept an offer by
Accrington to play as an avowed profes-
sional in the Lancashire League was timely,
for the young man from St. George seems
to have this season lost all the cricket he
may have had in him. With talent money
and other oddments it is expected the 30b
will be worth £lOOO a year. There was quite
a rush for it. Dick Tyldesley, who
was in Australia with Chapman s 1924 team,
was one, and others were 1. Ryan, an
American, who has qualified for Glamorgan,
F. Barrett, of Notts, and G. Headley,, the
West Indian batsman, who made such a
fine showing in this country last year.

“Hotham”: Ponsford hoisted another
record last week when lie ran up three
figures against South Australia at Adelaide.
This was his 24th century for the C abbage
Garden, and he now leads Warwick Arm-
strong, whose tally of 23 had stood for
years. Ponsford has taken only 10 seasons
to pile up his figures, whereas the burly
Warwick took 20 over his collection.
Racquet and Bawl
“C. Court”: Wallace Myers has issued his
annual ranking list, like all the other experts
in different countries —and no two lists ever
agree. Ilis placings are Cochet, Austin,
Vines, Perry, Shields, Wood, Borotra, Lott
and Van Ryn—two Englishmen, two French-
men, one Jap. and the balance Yanks. Fcyv
will agree with Austin’s position. As none of
the Australian cracks showed in Europe
or America this season. Crawford and co.
have not been considered.
* * » *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: An English journal
dealing with the past tennis season refers
admiringly to the “sportsmanship” of Jean
Borotra, who, because the American Shields
had injured his leg in the semi-finals of the
singles at Wimbledon, deliberately played
every ball back to his opponent’s forehand,
enabling him to win the game. The “chival-
rous” action was wasted, however,, for
Shields could not play in the final and his
compatriot Wood won by a walkover. In
no other game but tennis would this sort
of thing be tolerated. It is a contradiction
of all sporting ethics, and an insult to the
public.
The Nineteenth Hole
Tommy Howard, of Concord club, is once
more professional champion of N.S.W.
Against the holder of the national profes-
sional title, Don Spence, of Leura, lommy
played one of the games of his life, ending
up winner by the whacking margin or. lo .1
and 11 to play. Deadly accuracy in
approaching and putting was the feature i
his game, and Spence never had a look in.
Howard first entered the golfing limeiignt
by winning the N.S.W. amateur champion-
ship in i!JI9, taking the Queensland title
the same year. He won the Ma „
event again in 1921, the Australian open
in 1923, and professional honors two
years later, after collecting the N.S.W. Pro-
fessional championship of 1924 by way of
getting his eye in. Now 43, he began
playing golf at 24, and in between has won
stacks of big events besides those mentioned.

“Divot Digger”: The conditions for the
Ma State A.I.F. State golf championship
next season have been radically alteied.
Instead of being held on three separate
courses, as was done in the past with the.
idea of relieving the congestion caused oy
the huge entry, the 1932 competition will
be held at Kengsington, and to expedite play
will be a par handicap event. Under tnis
system players down to par on each greeji
can pick up. Captain Walker, the Aus-
tralian club’s secretary, will supply tun
particulars. , #
“Gregory Terrace”: There is not to be
a bar at the golf club which is being
formed in connection with the Brisbane muni-
cipal links at Victoria Park.. Besides being
a negation of the leading principle ol g > ,
the decision is of questionable wisdom, it
is the bar which finds most of the funds foi
any club fortunate enough to sport one, as
most bowlers and golfers will testify,
is true that there is no bar available tor the
users of Sydney’s successful public course
at Moore Park, but there are pubs within
crawling distance, and a heartening view
of a brewery. In Brisbane, as far as 11
writer can recall it, the nearest oasis
over a mile away.

“Birdie”: Although there are no green
fees at Goodna (B. 4/11/’3l) there are
an entrance fee of £3 3s. for membei
and associates and an annual sub. or
£3 3s. and £2 2s. respectively. When one
remembers that it is practically the only
wet-weather course in the Brisbane aiea,
and that its construction is such that at no
time during the season is the sun directly
in the golfers’ eyes, one can quite under-
stand its popularity.
;V *»*
“Hovlake”: British golfing journals have
again been commenting on the long-driving
obsession. There is certainly a satisfaction
in a mighty wipe off the tee or a good wood
shot through the green, but as a means to
winning matches both are futile, lhc
medium and short, approach and the work
with the putter on the green are the decid-
ing factors in golf. Britain, long given over
to the slathcrumwliack game, has begun to
realise, thanks to bitter experience with the
Americans, that it does not pay. Recent y
an approaching and putting tourney was
held at Arbroath with the idea of impressing
on players the importance of the short game.
We want something of the sort m Australia,
•where the golf-watching public and the golt-
recording press are both obsessed with the
idea that distance from the tee is all that
matters.
Car and Cycle
“Differential”: Malcolm Campbell is evi-
dently keeping a nervous eye on Wizard
Smith, who is now in Maoriland making ready
for his attempt on the world’s speed record.
Malcolm announces that his car, the Blue-
bird is being overhauled in anticipation ot
his record of 245.736 m.p.h. being beaten by
the Australian speedster, in which case he
will have a try to establish yet another set
of figures. It would be a fair thing if lie
gave the much over-rated Daytona Beach
the go-by and made his next attempt on the
M.L. sands.

“Week Ender”: The annual London to
Brighton run for ancient motor-cars, which
was first held in 1896 when the speed limit
was two miles an hour, increases in P?P U "
larity every year, and a huge crowd lined
the 50 miles to watch the ancients wheezing
bv. Forty-two cars out of 57 entrants com-
pleted the run, one of them having been a
participant in the first race. The bes
mileage was done by a 1904 Darracq which
had been lying for 15 years in a barn; it
averaged 25.45 m.p.h. Comedy was added
to by the spectacle of a venerable Benz cai
racing a flash 1932 model up the stififest lull
section of the route and beating it badly.
* * * *
“Swish”: Quite the latest thing in
exalted motoring circles is to have one s
car made to order, and to a special design.
The Bugatti people started the craze some
time ago by designing a special car—at a
special price, of course —which was only to
be sold to a few exclusive and approved
customers. The American Pierce- Aitov
firm has just turned out what must be the
last word in this sort of thing. It is a sports
plneton, and cost £25,000 to build. It is
finished in silver, and the hub-caps, instru-
ment board and gear-lever are mounted
with £20,000 worth of diamonds and other
precious stones. The name of the man i.
was built for is not disclosed, but lie is
probably a prominent purveyor ot illegal
“hootch” —even a Tammany llall magnate
could scarcely afford to splash it to such an
* *
“Melchizedek”: That comment (B.
11/31 /’MI > on the changing times in the
matter of motors and cycles reminds me ot
some mildly surprised comment contained
in a clipping from an Isle of Wight news-
paper of the 1880's. This states that lI.M.
Queen Victoria was “so impressed with the
case with which a lady was propelling a
tricycle” that she had ordered one for the
Royal Princesses. Following on this lead,
the paper comments that it is possible that
tricycling for ladies would now become
fashionable. It had even heard of the for-
mation of a ladies’ tricycling club —there
were no “women” then—with “a special
costume suited to the exigencies of the
situation —something between the Turkish
and bloomer dress.” The journal stops there,
remembering possibly that it was a family
P R P ei \ *
“Glenelg”: South Australian push-bikers
are drawing up a scheme for a cycling tour
of the State some time about the end ot
next year, possibly in September or October.
The thing requires a great deal of organi-
sation and a special committee has been
busy drawing up a list of recommenda-
tions which will be submitted to the League
of South Australian Mheelmen. Touis of
this kind should be part of the annual pro-
gramme of every State cycling organisation
for apart from their athletic value, they &rve
riders a chance of a glimpse of of
their own country which they would other-
wise never have seen.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer” : The report that Jim Carl-
ton ran the 100 at Maitland (N.S.W.) in
9 2-sscc. the other day may be taken with
a ton of salt. The time equals the worlds
record held by Yankee Frank Wykoft and
Afrikander D. J. Joubert. Carlton s time
was done on grass, and we are asked to
believe that he equalled these cindcr-tiack
performances. Great runner as the JN.te.W.
boy is time like that is out of the question
unless perhaps the track was down hill and
the wind behind him. In any case times at
country meetings are a snare and a delusion,
and are rightly invariably received with
suspicion. That Carlton could do the figures
under championship conditions and when
wound up to his top, there is very little
doubt. H’e is officially credited with 9 o-ssec.,
and, though the fraction less means much
more than it sounds, it is not beyond him.
:)c * * *
“Bias”: For a long time there has been
dissatisfaction among Sydnev bowlers over
the wooden planking, which takes the place
of the turf “bank” at each end of the rink
in many Sydney clubs. Given a hard shot,
often the kitty or the bowl comes back on
to the rink instead of remaining m the
ditch, and that gives rise to unfair condi-
tions. There are some bowlers indeed who.
having had the draw of their _ bowls called
in question, have stoutly maintained that
the woods have been knocked out of shape
hv banging against the wooden banks,
hut that is as may be. In Victoria and most
of the other States only grass banks aie
permitted and it is time the Ma State fell
into line with the rest of the family.

“Third Base’’: Japanese baseballers are
very keen on paying Australia a visit, an
arrangements are now in tram tor a side
from Kyoto University or the naval train-
ing college at Osaka to come down from the
north. Kyoto was on the verge of visiting
us in 1927, but the Stanford University
team from California got in first. Baseball
has been played in Nippon for years and
the standard is very high, being nourished
by constant visits from American teams.
We had some experience of their ability
when the Japanese naval training cratt was
in Sydney some time ago. Though the
cadets could only raise a scratch team o
youngsters they showed excellent torm
against some of our best performers.
* * * *
“Hotham” : Henley-on-Yarra on November
28 promises to be a very posh show, entries
having been received from every State in
Australia in spite of the hard times. Though
N.S W has not sent a crew down as w-as
hoped, J. A. Goulding, the Sydney sculler,
who is the holder of the Yarra Challenge
Cup, will defend the trophy. One of the
toughest nuts he will have to crack is young
K. Langley, of Westralia, who gave Bobby
Pearce such a go for it in the Australian
sculling championship on the Swan in 19-9.
* * * *
“Topping Lift”: The big event of the
N S.W. yachting season will be the race in
Sydney for the Sayonara Cup, early in the
New Year. The periodical fight between
Victoria and N.S.W. will lose some interest
this time because the boat with which the
Cabbage Gardeners will challenge is the
Sydney-built Vanessa, herself a winner of the
cup for N.S.W., but now a Victorian by
purchase. The conditions for this race should
be recast. Though put together in Sydney,
the Vanessa was designed in Britain. Time
the Victorians set to work to design and
build their own boats, and the same applies
to N.S.W. also for that matter.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre of Queenslands
Dishinguished Sociat Lite
Music is the most democratic of tlie arts;
which, no doubt, explains why so many
more of us were asked to the music party at
Government House than to the dance earlier
in the week. For the music more than 300
swept up to the v.-r. portals in the hired,
deferred-payment or 10-year-old model motor ;
only a sprinkling of society’s sugar-plums
melted (the night was warm and still) at
the dance. It really was a very small affair
composed of very young things, arranged by
Sir Philip and Lady Game to introduce
their guest Patricia Mead to Sydney danc-
ing girls and boys, and to hail and farewell
the S’African cricketers.
The flowers on the music night were a
joy, and the arrangement of them (the
Yice-reine herself always sees to this)
showed all the artlessness of real art. In
the big entrance hall, with its wide shallow
staircase, red bouvardias and suave mag-
nolias glowed, and in the ballroom pink
azaleas were softly massed. Lady Game,
slim grace in flowing satin, held in contrast to
the off-white lustre of her frock an azalea-
pink feather-fan. Mrs. Gibb was bound in
black and gold. Miss Crowdy, whom this
Letter would like to dress in amber or Pekin
blue, wore smoke-grey laces. Patricia Mead,
glimpsed in a solitary moment, looked too
attractive in her white satin sheath to have
solitude for her companion for very long.
Aide Gifford’s mother, Mrs. G. H. Rayner,
was there very smart in black satin. Violin-
ist Balokovic and his wife seemed glad to be
back in Sydney, and.her frock of palest gold
lace wore its sleeves long and tight. Isidor
Goodman, Stanley Clarkson and Gwen
Selva, were the music-makers, their notes
as crisp and fresh as the earth scents from
the garden after the rain.
Mrs. Norman Lindsay writes to this
Letter from New York:—
In a week or two we will have a studio. We are
looking for one high up where we can get a little
quiet. New York is just noise; we are six floors
up now, yet not a moment are we free from noise
night or day. Norman has done only one drawing
since we arrived, a tailpiece for the “Cosmopolitan.”
It is for the January issue; most of the big mags,
work three months ahead. They paid $lOOO for the
job. It would seem a lot of money back in Aus-
tralia; it doesn’t seem nearly as much here. We
expect to hold a show in New York before Christmas
and one in Hollywood during January; I do not
know what we will do after that. One thing is
pretty clear even at this distance: Australia cannot
be depended upon for much in the way of art
sales for some years. Yet how Springwood calls!
Mrs. Arthur .Allen, that tall, good-looking
woman with the well-arranged hair who was
a noted front-seater at every concert, had,
besides her love of music, an intense interest
in the welfare of babies. On the Ivaritane
Mothercraft Centre she spent much time and
money, and as a memorial to her interest
the home at 23 Nelson-street, Woollahra,
has been rechristened the Ethel Allen Ivari-
taue Mothercraft Centre. Lady Game un-
veiled a bronze tablet on the verandah the
other afternoon. Mrs. John Bavin and
Margaret Allen helped in this graceful cere-
mony to their mother’s memory, but their
father was unable to come. Dr. Truby King
wasn’t there, either, and daughter Mary
was his ambassador. Lady Game is the
new president of the home.
The directors of the Common-wealth Bank
grow cautiouser and cautiouser. They
realise that in addition, to bullion and gilt-
edged securities they’ve now got Don Brad-
man’s best girl, Jessie Menzies, to guard
against marauders.
The open-air performance of “As You
Like It” seemed unreal, perhaps because
there was so much of the real about it. A
forest of the imagination has such limit-
less aisles of trees unspecified but all magi-
cal. In the grounds of St. Mervyn’s and
Buckhurst was a grassy knoll, tree- and
shrub-bedecked, for stage; there were grass-
grown terraces and an amphitheatre of
shaven lawn for the audiences. By day the
jacaranda burned blue-mauve against a
speckless sky, and the locusts’ song nearly
split the ear-drums. By night a moon
gleamed overhead, and the annual rally of
the frogs’ Orphans’ Society was in full
blast. With so much nature loose about the
premises, Scott Alexander is to be compli-
mented that the production remained a play.
Everything had been thought of. There
were amplifiers in the trees, and flood-
lights swept the grounds before the per-
formance and afterwards concentrated on
the hillock, on which Rosalind and Orlando,
Jaques and Touchstone lived over again
this most Arcadian and most sophisticated
of Shakspeare’s comedies. When characters
exited, they simply dropped out of sight
down the back of the knoll.
Barbara Smith, who looked so tall in
her Court dress of flowing gold, was a small
creature in the green doublet and breeks
in which she listened to the outpourings of
Orlando (Ken Fowles), the wood-carver of
'Arden. There were shepherdesses in rustic
hats and panniered skirts, there were dukes
and courtiers and ladies, and the trembling
strings of a harp gave soft accompaniment
to “Under the Greenwood Tree” and other
songs in this story of the forest-lovers.
The Industrial Blind Institute benefits
largely by the performance, and as the com-
mittee was, for the times, quite plutocratic,
tlie attendance was hundreds strong. In
the evening youth and beauty and males
were in serried ranks, expensive cars clut-
tered all the approaches to St. Mervyn’s,
and sleek satin and velvet purred on every
woman in the audience. The vice-regals
came, bringing their guests, the Gibbs.
Woman, as a rule, lias more say in the
designing of her seaside place than she is
allowed in the planning of her town home.
The result is that these out-of-town houses
are built with an economy of space and an
eye to smoothness of running that leaves
husband gasping. The latest example of the
perfect bungalow designed by a ‘ competent
housewife is the new home of the A. B.
Colemans at Narrabeen. Mrs. Coleman
planned every inch of it.
Members of the Josef Ivretschmann Club
drank culture and knowledge in deep
draughts when they lured Cyril Monk to
lecture to them. The stronghold above Pitt-
street was crowded, though, sadly be it told,
the males were heavily out-numbered. The
brilliant leader of the Con. Orchestra ex-
plained the classic, the romantic and the
national in music and illustrated the same
with his supple bow. This, with Horace
Keats’s support at the piano and Mrs.
Keats’s singing, made the lecture a sort of
royal road. Tartini, Beethoven, Rach-
maninoff and De Faria were the authors
chosen to exemplify the different schools.
“Philomena,” the Year-Book of Fourth-
year Nurses at Prince Alfred’s, is interest-
ing and bright. The girl alongside is Hope
Humphries, its
editor, who
has netted two
real poems for
this first
issue. “Poppy-
head” and “To
Deum” have
star-dust from
Parnas sian
heights upon
them, and if
they are by
members o f
the nursing
staff then
Sappho’s
.sehool at Mity-
lene was pro-
bably made
up of dear
little pros,
and efficient
nurses. The
pages of
“Philomena” are filled witjli pictures of
wlnte-capped girls, pretty enough for a
Cochrane _ show, alternating with handsome
and dashing residents and honoraries, and
all of them seem to have time to strike their
blooming lyres on the subject of the day’s
work. “Philomena” is dedicated in a digni-
fied little foreword to those sisters and
nurses of Prince Alfred’s who sacrificed life
and health in the Great War. Swiss photo.
Talking about nurses’ sacrifice of life and
health, something must be done about the
employment of trainees and young nurses
in the Coast and other hospitals where
T.B.’s are housed. The proportion of very
young women who themselves contract the
disease is said to be appalling; certainly
this Letter can make up far too long a list
of its own knowledge. In the opinion of
many doctors, no nurse should be put on
to this work until she is just turning into
the thirties.
Sir Philip Game didn’t go to the ball on
the Strathnaver. Being a Scout he pro-
bably reckoned he’d done his one good deed
for that day when he gave Mr. Lang 25
shining new M’s.L.C. The aides had a night
off, and looked as gay as kittens who’d just
had a nibble of catnip. There was quite a
feeling of adventure about getting aboard,
owing to rumors of 600 forged tickets abroad
in the land. When you handed in your slip
a Sherlock Holmes with a microscope
examined it for finger-prints, and then
passed it on to Horatius 11., who held it up
to the light like a housewife viewing a
doubtful egg. When the “All’s Well: Pass !”
had been given, the girl and her escort went
aboard the lugger to find decks and lounges
swarming with humans.
Pretty girls in dashing frocks (one in the
new backless fashion, evolved in pale green,
had a small emerald-green velvet heart stuck
on her left shoulder-blade; another was in
beige chiffons, pyjamas and sandals) ; pretty
girls in plainly beautiful frocks (among
these tall Mary Brigham, in sleek-fitting
water-green moire, with inlet godets of black
satin; Margaret Honey in palely-pink
and Margaret Hagon in filmy-blue laces)
and pretty girls in shabby end-of-the-season
frocks; in fact, pretty girls in every sort
of frock laughed and danced, shivered over
the bathing-pool—the night was bitter cold
—and were just in the right degree feminine
to make their escorts feel protective heroes.
Mrs. W. A. Mackay, president of the
dance, which is as manna from Heaven to
the Rawson Institute, moved through the
night a blue-satin figure lit with diamente.
The Feakes couple and the Balokovics were
in company. Pat Levy and Mrs. Pat, and
Mrs. Dong Levy, Mary Wells, Clarence
Murphy and Marjorie Kirkpatrick were
among the bright young people. Artist
John Longstaff and Mrs. Conor Macleod
turned an observant eye on the ever-moving
hundreds from their chairs in the lounge.
Not far off were Rear-Admiral Stevenson
and his wife and the Harry Dransfields, she
overlooking the most breath-taking collar
of ermine. Knoxes, Fairfaxes, Streets and
Lambs displayed their shoulders and exer-
cised their toes in the good cause ; and Midge
Chisholm, soon to live in far Kashmir, was
alluring in green lace.
In the Society of Women Painters’ show
at David Jones’s there is a finely-modelled
torso, the
work of Mavis
Mallinson, the
subject of this
picture. Miss
Mallinson
(Mrs. G. H.
Dawson)
comes from
Tasmania, and
is proud of
the diploma of
Graphic Art
won at Ho-
bart’s Techni-
cal School.
Since coming
to Sydney she
has studied
modelling with
Rayner Hoff
at Sydney
Tech.; also she
works iu pas-
tels and has a
talent for highly decorative illustration.
“Omar Khayyam’’ and “Hiawatha” have
stirred her imagination to some really hue
work. Photo, from May Moore studio.
Saturday’s smart afternoon party was
achieved by Mrs. A. T. Anderson, who mixed
tea and art with outstanding success and
rounded up half of Sydney to taste her brew.
Mrs. Anderson is a consistent barracker for
the young and modern artist, and on the
walls of her home, Ball Green, at Turra-
murra, she had hung the works of Grace
Cossington-Smitli, Jean and Gwen rtamsay
and Roland Wakelin. Sir Hugh Poynter
made a graceful speech in opening the show,
and Mrs. Anderson followed with news of
Roy de Mestre’s success in London and
Paris. Among the exhibits was a portrait
of Commander Gifford. This naturally was
of interest to the Government House group,
including the commander’s mother, Mrs.
Rayner, who was there with her husband.
Tea was served in the barn, which the
daughter of the house, now Bethia Fbott,
turned into a studio when she led the group
known as the Turramurra Wall Painters.
The exhibition will be open to the public
till December 5.
Marie Byles, one of Sydney’s earliest
woman solicitors, is the author of a travel-
book which will prove that a trip abroad is
within the reach of even limited means. She
has called her travelogue. “By Cargo Boat
and Mountain.” Miss Byles journeyed to
Europe by a Norwegian cargo-boat, and when
she got to a country she liked—well, she got
out and made friends With it by walking
with it. Miss Byles has been for years a
Sydney Bush Walker.
It was a pity the Strathnaver Ball and
Joan Mackaness’s concert were arranged for
the same evening. The concert was to pro-
vide a Christmas box for a little group of
writers who have fallen on bad times.; but
though much thought and talent went to the
programme, there was nothing like a crush.
Cecile Adkins, Bessie Coleman and luarjorie
Hesse were the three girl artists, who trailed
decorative chiffons on a stage massed with
golden wattle; and Lionel Lawson, Frank
Hutchens, Gladstone Bell and Clem Williams
flung melodic gems into the night.
When Mrs. Frances Ricketson Warner,
widow of Archibald Glcnville Warner, of
Southport (Q.), married Donald Roy John-
son at Norfolk Island recently, the two
added romance to a friendship that existed
between their grandfathers, both settlers of
the ’fifties, who owned properties in Queens-
land, Victoria and N. S. Wales. St. Bar-
nabas’s Chapel, Norfolk Island, blessed the
vows, and Padre John Robinson made all
secure. The bride is the only daughter of
the late Joseph Kendall and Mrs Peterson,
of Barratta, Norfolk Island, and formerly
of Yarravale and Blythdale stations
(W.Q.). Norfolk Island will be the home
address of Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.
Harold Weigall’s widow, before her mar-
riage Hilda Caro, is, like the rest of
the world just now, trifling with commerce.
She has placed upon the market the sham-
poo which the Caro family, all growers of
notable heads of hair, have always used.
Called Neo Caro, it is done up in jars
which carry a blue and gold label blazoned
with pyramids.
Who plans the “improvements” at Syd-
ney’s public parks and does any authority
have to O.K. them? At Athol Gardens, really
that part of the Zoo which is not enclosed
by the big stone fence, the old safe play-
ground for children has been visited by some
vandal with a ton or two of cement and
a supply of building stone with nice sharp
edges and corners; and these have beeu
laid, mostly around swings, where they are
calculated ,to do most harm. Perhaps it
was done to give employment; certainly
more should bo given now in tearing it ail
up again. Meantime the place should be
closed as too dangerous a playground for
infants.
Ruth Stevens’s work at the Infants’
Demonstration School at Blackfriars has
been justified by results. Fresh air, sunlight
and a lunch chosen for its food values are
all in the day’s work for the kiddies under
her charge, with the result that the per-
centage of under-nourished children in her
school, has dropped to 14, and last
year 92 per cent, of the Blackfriars
scholars were free from infectious diseases.
Wholemeal bread, milk, lettuce and apple
play a large part in the lunch menus, and
our miracle-working sunlight is really made
use of. The latest experiment of this go-
ahead woman is a verandah fitted with
special glass which allows ultra-violet rays
to penetrate.
A just-back girl says the swiftly-passing
bowler was being followed in ultra-smart sets
by the topper. Some of these are of white
velvet, such a one having been bought by
Gloria Swanson. Its only trimming was a
brooch in the shape of a small green parrot.
Bird-brooches are London’s latest fad; the
birds are made of real feathers.
And, lastly, here are two well-ahead
winter styles that a just-back is keeping
hidden from her dearest friends. The first is
a cape, cut Cossack style, in black Persian
lamb; the second is a jersey suit in grey.
The coat is of the Russian variety trimmed
with grey astrakhan at neck and edge
and belted with a black patent leather belt.
With this goes a small off-the-face felt hat
of a darker grey.
Queensland’s quota:—
The ball aboard the Strathnaver was largely
attended. The Governor and Lady Goodwin were
there, she in a shaded frock of orange and amber.
The vessel was filled with flowers from Brisbane
private gardens. A lounge was set for the vice-regal
party and there the seven debs, were received —
Frances and Elizabeth Black, Lilian Sloan, Ella Ford,
Ruby Simmons and Adele and Freda Greeter. Mrs.
Moore chose cameo pink; the Mayoress white mous-
seline ; Mrs. A. H. Whittingham was in white with
a little cape of white ring velvet; Kitty Hillcoat
in shell-pink; Mrs. H. H. Dixon was in raven’s wing;
Mrs. M. J. Scott in black ring velvet; Everil Trude
chose delphinium-blue; Mrs. B. C. F. Forde was in
raven mariette; Mrs. E. S. Mutton chose black lace;
Mrs. John Figgis was in gold sequined mariette.
Jean Trundle, who played with the Nellie Bramley
and other companies and whose long suit is Dickens
impersonations, has accepted the preliminary ring
from Victor Hardgreaves.
The Governor and Lady Goodwin went to Edward
Cahill’s conceit in the City Hall. With the vice-
regal party were the Premier and Mrs. Moore, Miss
E. McKenzie, the Mayor and Mayoress and
Archbishop Sharp. Bessie Dougall and Jill Manners
were the soloists, while A. Kaesar conducted the
Greater Brisbane Orchestra and Brisbane Citizens’
Band.
The Queensland Cup race drew a record crowd to
Ascot, where the lawn was radiant with gay-colored
chiffons, cottons, silks and all manner of summer
weavings, with bright parasols like flowers on the
green. The Governor lunched with the committee.
Lady Goodwin came later in Roman red with a
small black hat; with her were Mrs. Lloyd, in black
and white, and Dorothy Hawthorn, who matched
her brown eyes with a brown aud blue turn out.
With the Premier were Mrs. A, E. Moore, in painted
ivory georgette with white chip hat; and Mrs.
McDowall, in lapis-blue and white, with black hat.
The Blair lady was in a floral-patterned gown; Mrs.
D’Arcey Winten, whose husband owns the Cup winner,
was in navy blue with a pink ninon scarf. Dorothea
Collins chose blue and white with a touch of red.
There was a country wedding at Birnam, Muu-
gungo, the home of the bride, when G. Byrom
married Violet May Goody. The bride, who was
given away by her father, was in white satin
beaute. Jean and Vera Goody ’maided in green
crepe de Chine; Beryl Goody was trainbearer, in
blue. There was a dance after the wedding supper;
and the honeymoon is at Yeppoon.
At All Saints’, Mitchell, Robert Lethbridge and
Thelma Loughnan were made one. The bride was
given away in ivory satin, with a Limerick-lace veil.
Lilia Loughnan, Molly Lethbridge and Betty Flet-
cher ’maided.

So far as the women’s dressing was con-
cerned the race gathering at Canlfield of the
V.A.T.G. on Saturday was merely a matter
of fur coats. Summer is still a hope long
deferred in Melbourne. Though the skies
were threatening rain held off and the
attendance was good. Mrs % Ben Chaney,
Mrs. Merson Cooper, Mrs. Norman Robm-
son, whose bottle-green coat had a mole
collar and was topped by a felt hat, and
Mrs. McPherson were in the committee
ladies’ box. Mrs. Burnside, tailored in gun-
metal grey cloth with a lighter felt hat, was
accompanied by her mother, Mrs. Leland
Greene, of Camperdown, who was all in
navy blue. Mr. and Mrs. Richard Linton,
she well wrapped in furs, her sister Mrs.
Murray Heffernan, similarly clad, and Mrs.
H. S. K. Ward, in black with a pale-green
vest, were there. Mrs. Harold' Luxtou
watched the sport with Mrs. U. J. Nicholas.
Mrs. J. Twomey was a visitor from lens-
hurst. Wing-Commander Eric Harrisons
wife contrasted a black tailored costume
with a white felt hat. With her was Mrs.
H. R. Johnson. The Percy Blackbourns,
Mrs. Oscar Ireland, Mrs. Rupert Downes
and the W. Rogers Thomsons were patrons.
The course was looking fresh and green after
an amplitude of rain.
The P.L.C. Old Collegians had bad luck
with what was intended to be their garden
party on Saturday. It was a damp, dreary
day, and the reunion was held indoors, where
all was cheery. A huge log-fire crackled in
the entrance-hall of the school, and music
and chatter, with a little speech-making,
filled up the time very pleasantly. The wel-
coming hand was extended to the guests by
Mrs. E. C. Richards, president of the O. C.
Association, whose georgette frock and shiny
straw hat were of the hue mushroom brown;
Mrs. Gray, wife of the principal, who wore
a black ensemble with touch of white; and
Miss Laing, president of the O.C.A. Club,
who was in nattier blue with a matching hat.
The three hostesses carried bouquets of roses,
and much beautiful horticulture decorated
the lecture-hall. A tennis match between
past and present students was a feature of
the afternoon, and there was a display of
handicrafts and decorative designs by the
pupils. Greta Plambeck, a member of the
staff, exhibited some pretty examples of hand-
weaving, in silk, cotton and wool.
Looked at from the Royal d.-c. on Satur-
day night the stalls presented a serried array
of permanently-waved coiffures framed in
white fur collars, with just a few neatly-
barbered male heads to break the monotony.
Knight Robert Best, now on the directorate
of the Firm, was in a box with his wife and
a daughter or two. The Ray
Madame de Bavay and Vera and Dr. and
Mrs. Leon Jona were other first-nighters at
“Oh, Lady, Lady!” Herbert Browne, who
is not in the show, was having a ’busman s
holiday as a viewer. Mrs. Harry Emmerton
was among the ermine-wrapped in the d.-c.,
and Mrs. P. Nunn was another _so pro-
tected from cold in the r.-s. There is plenty
of smart dressing in the play. Romola
Hansen’s bridal array—a long bodice or
white satin that melts into quantities or
white tulle in a deep flounce, and yards of
embroidered net as veil and train —is charm-
ing. Equally so are the bridesmaids’ frocks,
of the faintest pink with large gathered
chiffon hats. White organdie with a lace
upper section mounted on cardinal is another
pretty effect that decks Miss Hansen, and
some delightful white satin gowns are
sported by the chorus. Jean Duncan, tall
and willowy, pours herself (at least that s
what it looks like) into a slinky, silver
lam 6 gown, very long and much flared, wit.i
a touch of black velvet about the corsage.
Black lace mittens complete the outfit.
At Merton Hall (C. of E. Girls’ Gram-
mar School) the Old Grammarians’ Asso-
ciation celebrated its 28th birthday. Present-
day students, students to be and the former
pupils mingled in keeping up the occasion.
A church service was followed by a lun-
cheon attended by about GO of the 0.G.A.,
and the in-between hours and the afternoon
were given over to basket-ball and miniature
golf. A tennis tournament was planned but
the showery weather wouldn’t permit it. A
children’s party wound up the day.
A bridge party given by Mrs. A. F. His-
' kens, at Grosvenor, Ivcw, was attended by
many. The hostess topped her black chiffon
velvet gown with a small plume-decked hat,
and her daughter Kathleen favored black
and white, with black millinery.
Sponsored by Mrs. J. C. Westhoven, Mrs.
Esmond Downey and Mrs. D. Gallagher
there was a party at the Oriental for the
Central Catholic Library. A musical pro-
gramme, for which Mrs. C. N. Finn, one-
time Dolly Castles, collected the artists, was
chief entertainment, with bridge as a side-
line. Among the music-makers were Eileen
Castles, in parchment-colored satin; Mrs.
Fleming Dunstan, in black lace with a
gleam of pink beneath; and pianist Joyce
Westhoven. Mrs. D. Barry and Agues For-
tune were the accompanists.
A regular garden of girls, a thousand of
them, ranging in age from four to twenty
years, were grouped upon the stage of the
Auditorium to celebrate the centenary of the
foundress of the Order of Mercy, Mother
Chatherine McAuley. The programme, an
extremely ambitious one, was furnished by
representatives from every convent school
of the order, and many ex-students assisted
in the choir and orchestra. The history ot
the order was unfolded in 12 tableaux. I our
girls as the angels of Light, Mercy, Hope and
Charity spoke introductory verses linking
up the narrative, which led up to the unveil-
ing of a statue of Mother McAuley. A
pageant of folk of the lands where there are
convents conducted by the Sisters of Mercy
filled the second portion of the bill.
At the annual summing-up of the Red
Cross it was reported that during the year
£19,314 was spent, spread over various sana-
toriums and hospitals, the Lady Helen club
for blinded soldiers, and many other activi-
ties. The fund now stands at something over
£68,282. A tribute was paid to the activity
of the junior members, who number 43,UW.
A study in bottle-green in gown and mil-
linery was the attire of Mrs. H. J. KoDert-
son. who presided at an afternoon-tea par ,y
at the Wentworth for the Hostel of the Aged
Blind at Windsor, of which she is president.
There was a programme of music.
Major and Mrs. Austin Bastow’s second
son, George, took for wife Nellie, only daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Bills, of Haw-
thorn, at Melbourne Grammar School
chapel. Ivory-tinted georgette with a veil of
Honiton lace was worn by the bride, and two
bridesmaids sported deep blue chiffon frocks
with black velvet hats and earned posies ot
crimson roses.
At Holy Trinity Church, East Melbourne,
Joan, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Eric Finlay-
son of Mansfield, and Douglas, second son
of the late Rev. Andrew Gillison and of Mrs.
Gillison, of Kew, were united. The bride is

Parchment-colored muslin and lace formed
the bridal array, with a tulle veil attached
to opalescent orange buds. lhe leading
lady’s twin sister, Jane, in pale pink georg-
ette, attended her.

younger daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Fairbairn, of Banongil squattage at
Skipton, and Ross, only son of Mrs. Grey
Smith, of South Yarra, and of the late F.

The James Dyers are to return on the
Oronsay on December 5. Our bachelor Lud
Mayor, Gengoult Smith, lias asked the lady,
who is liis sister, to take over the duties of
Mayoress. As a cut of £5OO has just been
made in the mayoral allowance, it is con-
jectured that there won’t be a great deal of
entertaining.
Barrie’s “Quality Street,” with “The
Moderns of Yesterday” as a curtain-raiser,
was put on at Kelvin Hall by the Loreto
Players, under the direction of Mrs. Maie
Iloban, for the benefit of the Loreto Free
Kindergarten. Mrs. J. J. Daly gathered
round her several girls to sell programmes
and sweets. In “Quality Street” the out-
standing performers were Wyn Breheny, as
Susan Throssell, and Nell Byrne, as Phoebe
Throssell. The house was full to overflow-
ing. Some of the costumes worn m the
Barrie' comedy were those used m the
Brough-Fleming production of years ago.
Norman Menzies, of Geelong, a pupil of
Ivor Boustead, John Brownlees teacher, has

Word comes from Paris that Elnrn Roach
and Mrs. Lanfear Thompson have settled in
a flat in the gay city, and with pencil and
brush are harvesting local color.
Miss Langley, of St. Catherine’s school,
and Mrs. Roland Fink have been nominated
by the South Yarra Auxiliary of the Chil-

Beach shorts are inclined to go gay this
summer. One pair this Chatterer vised early
in the week were gaily striped, said stripes
containing as many colors as Josephs coat.
Seeing the abbreviated bathers of tlie
moment, nearly all backless and so on (or oft),
this Chatterer can’t see why the fuss about
sun-baking in the nude. The steady elimina-
tion of years hate left only the narrowest
bridge to cross; and if anyone feels he or
she’s got the right sort of figure to parade
in the raw, let the creature parade! For-
tunately, most of us haven’t such conceit.
Costumes will be worn in every color and
every combination of color; some of them
are embroidered with monsters of the deep—
a yellow suit emblazoned with a black cray-
fish caught the eye, and a coral-pink batli-
ing-cap, with the nice new addendum to save
the back of the neck, had its front gar-
landed with coy yellow daisies. It’s a good
thing for the artistic eye that the beach
belle is no longer over-generous of curve.
Her winter slimming will stand her in good
stead when the' hot days come. If your
slimming diet has not proved all it promised,
remember that pyjamas are not so frank in
their revelations as the shorts. Pyjama-
suits in pique are tipped as winners. The
coats are white and rather in the middy
style; the trousers may be blue and.dotted,
red, brown and futuristic of design, or
striped like an awning. The only rule seems
that they must not agree in color with the
coat. Among the new things in beach shoes
are the wooden clogs, with bands # in striped
elastic to fasten them across the instep.

Tassie’s tale :—-
The Launceston Players scored a success with their
production for two nights of Barrie’s “What Every
Woman Knows.” Mrs. Phil Fvsh made an irresistible
Maggie. Mrs. W. K. Mclntyre produced the show,
and played a part as well. Mrs. Robert Hawker
and Mrs. G. R. Collins were responsible for the
charming stage settings, and one of the drop-scenes
was painted by Rosalie Humphrey, a member of
the society.
The dogs were the best feature of the Devonport
Show, though all other entries were well up to
standard. Several exhibitors from the mainland
were present. The weather was perfect, and the
ring events were particularly good.
Original members, as many as are left, and a few
newer lights met at the Hamilton Literary Society’s
rooms to hold a “Remembrance” afternoon. Con-
gratulatory messages were sent to the founder of
the society, Lady Hamilton, in London. Amy Chap-
man still holds her post of hon. sec.
The Amateur Horticultural Sociehy’s i«to
transformed the dull interior of the IL
a blaze of color and beauty The roses were a
trifle disappointing, owing to the recent high winds
and hot suns, but the display of other eaily summe
flowers was a gorgeous one.
The Frank Gummows, father and daughter, ave
settled at Ferntree for the summer. The -
Murrays are also back in the Speck for some months
residence, and have taken Mrs. Macleod s house
Sandy Bay-road. .
W P Hood has retired from the managership o
the A.M.P. Society in the Speck after a solid 50
years of service. He is succeeded by J. a.
Ewart, from N.S.W.
Mrs. Angus Butler has left, after a long stay wi
relatives in Hobart, to join her husband in Mgu a.
Mrs. A. J. Villiers is staying with her relatives
in Hobart during her husband’s lecture tour in
America. She came out in the Strathnaver.
South Australia’s note :
At the Port Adelaide R.C.’s meeting at Chelten-
ham, the chairman (Dr. A. V. Benson) presided
with Mrs. Benson at afternoon-tea. Mrs. Benson,
always a smart frocker, wore a brown and beige
patterned crepe-de-Chine ensemble, with a fawn
straw hat. Among striking toilettes was that of
Mrs. F. A. Tennant, a cherry-toned sports frock,
with beige stripes on the jumper, a beige straw
hat with a brown ostrich feather beneath the brim,
and a sable cape.
The bridge party to raise funds for purchasing
serum to combat infantile paralysis grew to an
affair of 301 tables, and the crowd overflowed from
the Piccadilly Cafe at Birks’ in Bundle-street to the
Liberal Hall on North-terrace. Mesdames 11. M.
Downey, S. L. Dawkins and A. M. Cudmore were
the organisers.
Another successful bridge party was held at the resi-
dence of Mrs. Max G. Anderson, Esplanade, Grange,
in aid of the local branch of the Mothers’ and
Babies’ Health Association.
The popularity of the retiring Mayor and Mayoress
of Glenelg (Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Sutherland) has
been attested by several functions. After a dinner
given to the Glenelg Council Mr. Sutherland was
presented with a smoker’s outfit and an escritoire.
On the next afternoon the Glenelg Women’s Service
Association and the District Trained Nursing Society
entertained Mrs. Sutherland at afternoon tea, and
gave her an English-china supper set.
At the Fitzroy croquet lawns a gymkhana was
held under delightful conditions. The tea-house
was gay with lovely blooms from the gaiden of
Mrs. J. M. Bath. Mrs. Percy Bollen received the
guests as president, and there was a representative
gathering of other clubs.
The visit of the English schoolboys has been
responsible for a rush of social engagements among
the younger set. Six hostesses gave a dance for
them at the Plaza: the Newland lady, Mesdames
A. M. Cudmore, Bronte Smeaton, J. H. Gosse, Harry
Gilnert and Lisle Johnson. It was quite a young
people’s affair and very jolly. The next night Mrs.
A. A. Simpson was the visitors’ hostess at a dance.
Three of the boys are so impressed with Australia
that they are determined to return later on.
Mention was made of a cot in the Children s
Hospital having been endowed by Mr. Fred “Jones,”
of Rose Park, in memory of his wife. Jones was an
obvious erratum: the name, of course, should have
been Fred Johns, the well-known journalist, bio-
grapher and compiler of “Who’s Who in Australia.’
Wostralia trumps in
The half-hundred maids and young matrons who
were invited by Peggy Watson-Williams to her
bridge party came along in their smartest clothes.
All-pink flowers interspersed with blue china deco-
rated the long L-shaped tea-table in the Karrakatta
Club. The hostess looked after her guests in a
cigar-brown ensemble worn with a white blouse,
and her mother assisted in a floral gown and white
millinery. Among the players were Beth and Bob
Johnston, Judy James, Claire Sinclair, Mrs. Bob
Leiper in wine-shaded romaine; Maude Sholl, Betty
McCulloch and Mrs. Reith Ross, in a very attractive
black rig ornamented with pink ’broideries.
Two doubles, one paying £BO for a os. risk,
were thrills at the Belmont meeting. Mrs. Langlois
Lefroy did her punting in navy taffetas; Mrs.
Robinson wore a befeathered bowler with her black
frock; a citron-shaded coat and skirt was chosen by
Mrs. Ambrose; Mrs. Dakin was in blue and white;
among the devotees of all black were Mrs. Laurie,
Mrs. Moss and Orea Moustaka ; Mrs. Ambrose Cum-
mins chose navy pin-spotted with white; Mrs. Crom-
melin wore a brown crepe frock and a little nutmeg-
straw hat; Mrs. Dave Walsh was clad in a salmon-
pink suit, and flowered chiffons fluttered about
Mrs. Solomon.
The E. S. Lazarus couple and daughter Julia
arrive here at the end of the month for a business
and holiday visit. Their home nowadays is in the
Foggy City. The Nathan knight and his lady are
packing up for a health and pleasure trip to M.L.
Thirty-five war nurses rallied to the Karrakatta
Club to dine, play bridge and chatter about old
times. As the years pass silvery hairs appear in the
locks of these Florence Nightingales, but there is
not one of them who would be without the vast,
experience of the war years. A visitor fiom Mel-
bourne was Mrs. Eric Chalmers, whose white ermine
wrap evoked admiration. Mrs. G. S. Cook, Mrs.
Craig and Miss Homan were there. In the absence
of president Mrs. Glyde, Mrs. O. Vetter and Miss
King both black-garbed, and Miss Ashton, in red,
spoke a word of welcome to new members.
At the back of the North Wind
Two weddings brightened up Darwin last month.
Mervyn Parer and Theresa Davidson were made one
at St. Mary’s Church, with Claude Cashman to give
the bride away and Mrs. Thompson as matron of
honor. The bride wore white satin, with Honiton-
lace veil and wreath. The ’moon is being spent in
a motor tour to Sydney. The other wedding was
that of Tasman Fitzer and Laurie Jean Osborne.
She wore white Eastern silk, with wreath and
veil; her sister ’maided. The ’moon is. being spent
in a trip to Maoriland.
The local Kuo Min Tang held a banquet to cele-
brate the 20th anniversary of the birth of the
Chinese Republic. Some 200 guests assembled and
there were speeches in both Chinese and English.

Riding' to Lose.
HAROLD MERCER DESCRIBES THE TEMPTATIONS OF AN INCOR-
RUPTIBLE.
“”\/DU tork erbout it bein’ ’ard ter win a
Y Cup! It is, an’ there’s not a bloke
knows it better than me; but that’s
nothin’ ter tryin’ ter lose a Cup.”
Old Joe Dixon had become confidential;
his finger-nail ran along a line in an old
paper. It was the impassioned eulogy of
a turf-writer who described Joe as “the
' incorruptible of the turf, a rider upon
whose inspired hands no breath of suspicion
has fallen.” Joe added his own version:
“I’ve been as honest as a bloke can be
without being a mug.”
Joe poured out some more beer, gloating
over the sparkle and foam of the liquor.
“This is a sorter consolation fer givin’ up
ridin’—you can take a glassi o’ beer without
thinkin’ of what it’s goin’ ter do ter yer
weigm,” he said, with satisfaction.
“You were saying you wanted to lose a
Cup?” I said.
“Wanted ter lose a Cup? Me?” he said.
“I ’ad ter try to lose a Cup; but as ter
wantin’ ter lose it—well, can you imagine
a parson not wantin’ ter be a narch-
bishop? Every rider ’opes to pull orf a
Cup before ’e finishes; an’ natcherally I
was after it when Pacer comes inter ther
limelight—an’ me booked ter pilot ’im! It
struck me all of a neap when I learnt we
weren’t to go for it! The owner, Frank
Ynton, was as upset erbout it as me—
though, on ’is side, ’e could ’ave another
shot; it was my larst charnce.
“It ’it me all ways; up ter then I'd
looked on Frank as a bloke ’oo would be
the sport .against all odds; not the sort of
bloke ter ’ave ’is nose pulled—not in the
Cup, anyway. But when I got the strong
of it I couldn’t ’ardly blame ’im.
“Y’see, Frank isn’t a rich man—’e’s rather
on the poor side, as nobs go. Pacer ’ad
been rather a surprise to ’im as well as
everyone. Frank lost is ’ead a bit; started
gettin’ the money on until ’is last shirt was
on it. If Pacer won "e ’ad a tidy fortune ;
if ’e lost, ’e was absolootely outed. Frank
was game ter take the risk.
“The trouble was that public support
poured on fer Pacer. ’E was linked with
everythin’ in the doubles ; an’ ’e was backed
straightout until the fortune Frank ’ad at
stake was a fleabite to the fortunes the
bookies were riskin’. It was a cert they
couldn’t square themselves nohow if Pacer
won. In desperation they tried to get at
Frank, an’ the ’orse, an’ me.
“ ‘They’re up to anythin’ to stop us,’
says Frank ter me, ‘but we’ll beat ’em!
Pacer’s goin’ ter win!’ It was that one
day—an’ the next ’e’d surrendered. Y’see,
they got the squeezer on ’im properly. ‘I
can’t stand the racket, Joe,’ lie said. ‘l’d
like to tell them to go their ’ardest; but
they’re desperate—they’ll stop at nothin’.
They’ll smash me before the race if I keep
out; an’ then I’ll lose the race an’ all I
’ave left!’
“Cripes! ’E looked miserable, an’ so was
I; but, after all, if I ’ad no charnce of ridin’
a winner, I might as well come out as well
as I could on the business side.
“It was that oily blankard Mossy Stokes
did the business with us; all the time we
was torkin’ I felt I’d like to land one on
that fat nose of ’is. I was better treated,
in a way, than Frank. ’E ’ad ’is liabilities
on Pacer. wiped out, of course; and there
was a big poultice to nothin’ fer ’im on
Princedom —which was erbout the most
likely of the rest with Pacer out of the way.
I ’ad a parcel on Princedom ’anded ter me,
too, but I was fixed better in the cash pro-
position. An’ seein’ that that was satis-
factory, I didn’t worry about mentionin’
the wad I’d put on Pacer meself.
“It was a relief when it was fixed. We
was safe, anyway, me and Frank, with the
chance of winning a hefty lump each on
Princedom.
“What I always says is these bookies
don’t know their game. They give the show
away, so that the mugs should ’ve tumbled;
pencillers ’oo ’ad shut right up on Pacer
opened out again, actually asking fer more
business on ’im. Of course, there was a
few smelt a rat; there was a bit of a run
on Princedom ter show that. An’ that was
why, going through the park at night, my
car was ’eld up by a gang. ‘ ’Sail right,
Joe,’ says one of them; ‘we don’t want
your cash. We just stopped yer ter give
yer a warnin’. If Pacer don’t win the Cup
you'll be dealt with. You’ll ’ave the soul-
case kicked off yer.’
“‘Very kind of you,’ I said sarcastic,
‘but if Pacer don't win ther Cup, what the
’ell’s goin’ to?’
“The cows! I didn’t mind ’ow much of
their money they put on an’ lorst. But
that was one of the things that made me begin
to realise that losin’ a Cup wasn’t goin’ to
be so easy. Then there was Bob Martin
came to me to say that he was layin’ me a
couide of ’undred to nothin’ on Pacer. An’
Martin ’ad always been a good friend.
“ ‘I don’t want that, Mr. Martin,’ I says.
‘Don’t do it! I wanter feel that I’m doin’
this ride fer the glory of it. What erbout
your own ’orses? Esmead’s got an outside
chance.’
“’E just winked at me, and went. It
gave me a bit of a sweat to know that
other ’orses, without us knowiu’ about it.
were running fer us. A couple of days
before I’d been countin’ on all the field as
likely to be against us; an’ ’ere I was
learnin’ that it might be ’ard for us to lose.
“There was other things, like when Jim
Larsen came ter pump me. As well as I
could, I tried ter put _ ’im off doin’ ’ees
dough on Pacer, but) ’e just grinned at me.
And ’e told me straight ’is mount, Mount-
joy, was out of the runnin’.
“I tried not ter think of ’ow I was
chuckin’ away me chance of being a Cup
winner; but in spite of meself I woke up at
night sometimes, an’ squirmed when I
thought of it. And then I’d git nightmares
of all the ’orses in the race bein’ tied up ter
let Pacer win.
“The ’ole thing was gettin’ me down, an’
poor Frank was feelin’ it worse than I was.
‘l’ll chuck this damned racin’ game directly
this is through; it makes a man feel like a
crook,’ ’e tole me several times.
“The day of the Cup I was a bunch of
nerves. I’d reckoned I’d be that way if I
was out ter win, not knowin’ what the
others was goin’ ter spring ter stop me;
but ’ere I was feelin’ bad over the diffi-
culties of ’avin’ ter lose the blanky race!
“The feelin’ grew worse as I ’card what
the crowd was sayin’. ‘Wouldn’t ’ave any-
thin’ but Pacer on me mind—it’s Pacer fer
a cert’: that’s what you ’eard every side.
An’ I thought of the blokes ’oo ’ad nromised
me a wallopin’ if Pacer lorst, although what
they’d do to me would be nothin’ to what
this crowd would feel like doin’ if they
guessed I was ridin’ a schlenter.
“Paisley, the steward, ’oo always looked
ter me like a parson ’oo’d taken by mistake
to ’orse-racin’, ’ad a word with me, warnin’
me of the public dough I carried, and the
row there’d be if I lost.
“ ‘l’ll do me best, Mr. Paisley,’ I says.
“ ‘Yes, mind you do,’ ’e says, drily. It
sounded like a threat. Me—l was feelin’
’appy, I don’t think!
“In the Paddock Tommy Straclian, ’oo’s
up on Skylark, sidles up ter me with a
‘Good luck, Joe. Make er good race of it.’
“ "Ow erbout Skylark?’ I says. “E’s got
er bit of a chance, they tell me.’
“‘Wot? Against Pacer? Forget it, ’e
says. ‘All I’m out fer is the money fer a
place; but I’d sooner lose that than see
Pacer lose. Anythin’ I can do fer you when
the bumps start I’ll do. You can depend on
me!’
“Me ’eart thudded. I could depend on
Tommy Straclian ! The friendliness of some of
the other boys didn’t matter so much, their
’orses not bein’ in the tork like Skylark. I
began ter git an ’orrible feelin’ that I’d
ave ter win! Fer me own part, o’ course,
I d sooner ave ridden a Gup winner ? than
git all the tea in China, but a. bloke as to
run straight with is connections. I ad
ter see poor Frank through.
“’ls ’ands were shakin’ when ’e spoke ter
me; ’is voice seemed ’oarse an’ strange,
an’ there was lines on ’is face, which was
dead white. There was us, both made safe
on the nice, as it ad seemed yet this was

“We moved ihead a bit. Someone bumped
us. an’ that was Pacer’s reply—to get a’ead
of it. I ’ad ter let ’im go for fear of too
plainly pullin’ ’im. There was a roar from
the crowd of ‘Pacer!’ which told me the
eyes of all that crowd was on us. Nice fer
me, that was '
“I steadied Pacer, though the beauty
wanted ter keep goin’; ’e ’ad anv amount
of steam in ’im. An’ there was'l. along-
side Princedom, goin’ stride fer stride wirn
’im. Levey, ’oo was on ’im, gave a sorter
little grin as ’e saw ’im come up to ’im.
An’ there we stayed, with the pace seemin’
sickenin’ slow.
“Levey an’ I was apprenticed tergether
an’ ’ad been lifelong friends. I didn’t mind
openin’ out ter ’im; an’ I was gettin’
anxious. I leaned a bit towards ’im.
“ ‘Fer Gawd’s sake, Abe,’ I panted out,
‘shake it up. Make a race of it.’
“’E threw a quick grin at me; I jest
caught ’is reply, panted out like my own
words above the noise.
“ ‘Waitin’ fer you. I’ll foller you in.’
“ ‘Princedom’s on a win, ain’t it ?’ I
pants out.
“ ‘ ’Ope you ain’t wasted no money on
it!’ he garsps.
“The dirty swine—they ’ad double-crossed
us j Too much money ’ad come in for
Princedom in the larst few days. The cows
wanted the earth, an’, ’avin’ put Frank an’
me on Princedom fer our cut, they ’adn’t
cared tuppence fer diddlin’ us.
“In the rage that seized me I must ha'
pushed Pacer a’ead er bit; an’ he jumped
at the ’int. Princedom came with us, keepin
on me girth; and a great roar went up
from the crowd. But in a moment I ’ad a
plan. It was a desp’rate idea. I’d keep
Princedom on terms with me, takin’ ’im
right through, an’ at the larst moment I’d
pull Pacer fer all I was worth, an’ let
Princedom through before Levey saw ther
game. The thing would be plain, of course.
I’d end me turf career in disgrace instead
of glory; but I was finishin’ in any case,
an’ as I felt then, I didn’t care a damn.
The cow wrnuld win, an’ Frank an’ me would
get what was due to us,
“Pacer, glad ter he let out, was goin’ great
guns, but I ’eld ’im ernough to keep Prince-
dom w’ere I wanted, with ’ees ’ead along-
side me knee. The colors of the jocks on
the other ’orses seemed to fade away back
of us as we passed them, and the roars of
the crowd sounded like the surf on a rough
day.
“As we swept inter the straight we was
over’aulin’ the ’orses in front of us as it
they was ’ardly movin’, an’ the crowd ’ad
gorn ’ysterical. It was just one long roar
of ‘Pacer! Come on, you beaut!’ over and
over again.
“Poor cows! They was ter be let down—it
was Princedom was gofn’ ter win.
“We only ’ad Willowee a’ead of us now,
an’ she was beat; but I got a idea of some-
thin’ cornin’ fast on the outside. Prince-
dom wasn’t cornin’ along fast enough fer
me, an’ I sent Pacer along a bit more, in
the 'opes that Abe would foller, as ’e did.
I couldn’t afford to let this other thing
catch us. I took a quick look back outer the
corner of me eye, an’ saw, almost on me
quarter, the white blaze that meant Skylark.
“Another dirty crook cow—kiddin’ ter
me ter put me off me guard, an’ now
cornin’ all ’e knew ter cut me down !
“Pacer responded to me call, but Prince-
dom faded away a bit; ’e didn’t seem ter
’ave it in ’im.
“ ‘Skylark ! The favorite’s beaten !’
“I caught that, suddenly, from the crowd.
There was that white blaze on me girth, an’
gainin’ inches.
“ ‘ Damn yer, Pacer, you're goin ’ ter win!'
I howls out loud, an’ settled down ter ride
fer all I was worth. You see, I gotter angle
I ’adn’t been able ter see before, bein’ mixed
up with all that crook work. The big prize
was somethin’ fer Frank, if ’e didn’t get
nothin’ else; an’ fer me there was the
pride of ’avin’ ridden a Cup winner—
besides me own bit on an’ Bob Martin’s
couple o’ hundred an’ a few other titbits.
“But Skylark was on level terms now —
and now a’ead! The crowd was groanin’;
there was more in that ’orse than I’d
thought. An’ only a few yards ter go!
“A sort of super’uman feelin’ came ter
me. I threw meself body an’ soul inter the
effort. Cripes, ’ow game ’e answered! We
caught up the inches Skylark ’ad gained in
a few strides ; but Skylark ’ung on. We went
past the post so close together that I’m
damned if I knew which ’ad won. I ’ad a
sinkin’ feelin’ it was Skylark.
“It seemed a dead ’ush ’ad fallen on the
place; but the thing was settled in the vast
roar and the tumult of cheerin’ that went
up when the numbers appeared. Bloomee,
I’d ridden the Cup winner, after all!
“Frank was acshally pleased, more so
when I told ’im all about it; but it’s not
necessary fer me ter say what Mossy Stokes
an’ that crowd .said erbout it. My troubles!
seein’ how things panned out financially;
an’ I was present at Frank’s weddin'—that
was one of the things what had made ’im
windy, it seems.
“That,” said Joe, with a whimsical smile,
“was when that press cove wrote the stuff
about me bein’ the incorruptible of the
turf.”
