War Books
For some years a'fter the world war
women, with the exception of a few
society gossipers, didn’t write war books,
and the few men who did were
professionals—Robert Graves, Frederick
Manning, Siegfried Sassoon and the
like —whose chief aim seemed to b
to do good literary jobs. The faker
led by the author of “All Quiet,” bega
to make the public distrustful, and Holly
wood’s travesties on life at the front an
in back areas completed the business.
Then women who had done seriou
work overseas started to become artici
late, and about the same time th
urge to write was felt by men who wer
soldiers first and writers afterwards. On
or two, such as the Australian Leonarc
Mann (“Flesh in Armor”), happened
be born writers, but most of them ar
typified by the splendid English privat
Frank Richards (“Old Soldiers Neve
Die”). Practically all the women, on
the other hand, have been self-consciou
stylists with messages, mostly of a bitte
nature, directed at the heedless young
Two representative modern war books
by a woman and a man respectively, are
reviewed below.
Mind of a V.A.D.
Vera Brittain, whose Testament
Youth has been published by Gollancz
at Bs. 6d., was born 40 years ago in
Five Towns environment. She had jus
persuaded her parents to let her go to
Oxford when the war came. Her fiance
Robert Leighton, one of the youngei
English poets, was killed in France on
the edge of his Christmas leave. Her
brother was shot through the head on
the Asiago. Two other intimate men
friends became casualties, and she her
self, after serving as a V.A.D. in Malta
and in France, returned to Somerville—
a new, strange, feverish Somerville set
in an Oxford full of Beverley Nicholses
and Leslie Hore-Belishas. The rest
describes her recovery from the stunnec
condition of futility which numbed the
minds of so many intellectual women
after the war.
It is a strange, frank book, rich in
nervous detail. Every visit to a grave-
side, every nuance of grief is elaborated
out of a fond and brooding memory. It
has the air of having been written rather
to relieve the author’s repressions than
for public consumption. All the objec-
tive bitterness of her class, all the un-
reasoning hatreds, the nerve-storms, the
hallucinations of the war -period have
been transmuted into words ; and then
comes a description of the fierce energy
with which women like herself are pro-
pagating the peace theorisms of the day.
Miss Brittain’s rancor is not directed
altogether against others. She does not
spare herself, and whatever she has to say
she says with dignity. Her photographi-
cally detailed method is probably one of
the main reasons for the success of the
book ; it reflects the outlook of so many
millions of her contemporaries.
A Good Soldier
H. R. Williams’s The Gallant Company
(Angus and Robertson ; 65.) is a self-
portrait. Not an intended one; there
never was a more modest aiitobiograph-
ist. The author is l'evealed, almost en-
tirely, in his estimates of other men ; and
he stands out at the finish as the kind of
solid, resolute, disciplined idealist whom
every active-service C.O. would like to
have in his unit.
Mr. Williams enlisted in Sydney in
July, 1915, and was posted to A Com-
pany of the 56th Battalion, at Tel-el-
Kebir, shortly after the Evacuation. All
his officers, from Lieut.-Colonel A. H.
Scott, who commanded the battalion,
downwards, were Ist Division Anzacs.
His story is based on a diary and on
letters which he wrote during the war..
He makes no attempt at fine writing ;
just sets down in plain terms the things
he and his comrades did and what they
thought of those in authority over them.
His story of the evolution of Captain
Fanning from a
detested martinet
to the idol of the
company is a
revelation of the
way men react to
great qualities.
Such leaders as Fanning have the odd
faculty of making hard-bitten old soldiers
feel like romantic boys again.
His personality gripped us. He made us jump
to his commands as nobody had done before.
We feared him, but even his dress had some
romantic touch about, it that fascinated us. 1
imagined him to have been in some other life
a pirate chief.
He addressed them as the battalion
was leaving for France, mentioning that
he had been hard for a purpose and that
he “knew some of the names they had
called him.”
You hate me now. You may think otherwise
when we have been in action together.
Fanning was killed on the Somme in
November, ’l6, but not before he had
seen his prophecy fulfilled.
Months later, when we were near Becordel,
on the only afternoon that we had off from
parade a voluntary fatigue-party went across
and attended to his grave.
The remarkable feature of the book is
the writer’s freedom from resentments.
He was in at the finish of the Moascar
march ; a time when the survivors were
“foaming at the mouth like mad dogs,
with tongues swollen, breath gripping
their throats with agonising pain and legs
buckling under them.” Yet in the cold
and filth of the Guedecourt sector he
reflects complacently that it was men who,
like himself, had been “hardened to the
toughness of working bullocks” in Egypt
who Were standing up to the conditions
best. He admires the English, and he is
lyrical about the Scotch; but. his
warmest praises are of course for the
officers and men of the A.1.F., and par-
ticularly for those whom he knew. He
blames nobody. Such simple, valiant
characters are unconscious propagandists
for war ; they make the ghastly business
seem ethical, almost holy.

The Japanese “Menace”
A welcome antidote to the anti-
Japanese propaganda which recently
succeeded bodyline bowling as a catch-
penny stunt with a section of the Aus-
tralian press is The Defence of Australia,
by M. H. Ellis (Endeavour Press, Syd-
ney ; Is. 6d.). Mr. Ellis has studied Paci-
fic problems here and in Asia for many
years past, and has written about them
Extensively in Australian and overseas
publications.
His latest work is divided into six
short chapters and an appendix, the lat-
ter showing the relative strength of the
world’s navies at the beginning of this
year. The sections dealing with the pos-
sibilities of a Japanese invasion of this
country are perhaps the most interesting.
Clearly, and backing his argument with
official statistics, Mr. Ellis shows that
Japan has not the necessary military or
naval strength to bring an armada-of the
size visioned by stunting newspapers and
politicians in safety through the long sea
journey from its home base to this coun-
try. He stresses that transport by land
or sea is the most formidable of all mili-
tary problems ; a matter which has been
overlooked by most of those whose case
he traverses.
Other chapters deal with the objec-
tives of Japan, which, as he points out,
has proved in past tests a faithful ally
of the Empire. The absurd contention
that the phantom invader could land
100,000 troops “in some quiet northern
river” is shattered by a few unassailable
facts, including a summary of Japan’s
mercantile marine. The author mentions
that if, by some miracle, a host of the
kind was landed in the far north its
chances of getting to a spot where it could
do any good for itself or its country
would be nebulous. Such an invasion,
moreover, would have to be conducted
with an unfriendly Russia in the rear, and
would involve a flank movement of many
thousands of miles along a front held
not only by the Empire, but by France
and the U.S.A. Both these countries, for
their own sakes alone, could be counted
on as actively hostile.
In summing up the situation, he con-
tends that the raiding of our east-coast

This little machine and this little
test answer all tyre claims . . .
In this test of Tyre Quality, Supertwist
Cord, used exclusively in Goodyear
Tyres, and cord used in ordinary tyres,
are stretched side by side in a little
machine.
As the handle is turned, the cords stretch
more and more. Turn the handle once
too often and the ORDINARY cord
snaps. It is finished. But watch the
Goodyear cord. You turn and turn and
turn, and still it keeps on stretching.
When at last it does surrender, it has
stretched up to 61 per cent, further.
Now, the cords in your tyres are under
terrific, constant, flexing strain, just as in
the little machine. What does this show?
It shows that if you have Goodyear Tyres
you have up to 61 per cent, greater
margin against premature failure.
This extra-elastic Supertwist Cord and
the famous All-Weather Tread, exclusive
Goodyear features, are two of the reasons
why “more people ride on Goodyear
Tyres than on any other tyre .”

proof of tyre quality.

J. B. H.
The Australian Publisher
A year or two ago there was an outcry
about taxes on knowledge. The customs
duties on books were removed, but no
bone of consolation was flung to the
struggling Australian industry of book
production.
Australia for years past has been
one of England’s best book cus-
tomers. In 1929 we absorbed a quarter
of the English export production, spend-
ing £1,094,346 on this privilege. In 1931
we were only third in the list of buyers
and spent £483,930 on an eighth of the
books exported. The English trade says
that “the taxes on knowledge” were
responsible for this remarkable decline
and regards last year’s figures, £534,212
(a sixth of the export), as a hopeful sign
for the future. Meanwhile there has
been a tremendous impetus in Australian
publishing, and the people who are
fostering this industry must look to the
future with apprehension.
At present imported books are free of
both primage and sales tax; the only
tax (if it can be called so) is the exchange.
The local publisher does not get off so
lightly—he has to pay taxes on the very
things which, when manufactured abroad,
come into Australia tax-free. On im-
ported antique wove or laid book paper
there is a primage of 10 per cent. On
strawboards for covers there is a duty of
£3 10s. a ton, plus 10 per cent, primage.
(The locally-made boards are not firm
enough for this work.) Cloth that is used
for casing carries a 10 per cent, primage
—it costs Is. 6d. a yard in Australia and
7d. in England. There are, of course,
heavy duties on machinery.
Novels retailing in England at 7s. 6d.
are sold to the booksellers at ss. on
subscription (i.e., before publication), and
less 16 2-3 per cent, after publication.
Royalties to authors are paid on English
sales at the rate of 10 per cent. These
same novels are sold to the Australian
booksellers at a discount of 50 per cent.,
and on all such sales the author is forced
to accept a flat rate of 3d. a copy.
The same type of novel is produced in
Australia to retail at 6s. a copy, with
the usual discount of 33 1-3 per cent,
to the booksellers. The author’s royalties
are paid on a sliding scale of from 10
per cent, upwards. The publisher also
has to pay the taxes mentioned above.
He produces a domestic literature, of
which the country is in need, gives local
authors the opportunity of seeing their
books published, and turns out a job that
can compare quite favorably in crafts-
manship with any imported books.
And yet the burden of complaint about
Australian books is that they are too
dear. They may be, but it is not the
publisher’s fault.
JAYDE.
Brevity and Humor
Can anybody say with certainty when
or how The Bulletin turned from its
original brevity to the other thing?
Several times lately Archibald has
been acclaimed for his gift of pruning,
of cutting out unessentials. ' But this —
like all other virtues —was often over-
done. McLeod, looking reminiscently
through The Bulletin’s first volume
with me, about 1921, pointed out some
over-brevities. “So-and-so went to Mel-
bourne on Thursday” was an instance.
The Bulletin was never meant to be
a mere newspaper. It was to be a jour-
nal of candid comment on political and
social affairs, and good yarns. And
you can’t provide that kind of service in
short, sharp yelps. The fact was soon
recognised, and the change made. In
the page that was devoted till recentlv
to reprints from Bulletin issues of the
early ’nineties, it was noticeable that
nearly every item was perhaps half as
long again as a modern Bulletin para-
graph.
Who engineered the change? James
Edmond, perhaps. He needed plenty of
room to turn round in ; for his most
engaging trick was that of improvising
on a theme—saying the same thing seve-
ral times over, and always in a different
way. Charming, as he did it, but a trick
soon learned, and obviously a danger in
lesser hands.
My own first appearance in The
Bulletin, in those early ’nineties, was
a terse and unforgettable note in the
Answers to Correspondents column :
“S.T.S.: You cavort too much.” The
word isn’t in all the dictionaries ; but
Webster admits it guardedly (as being
“U. 5.,” and “local slang” at that), mean-
ing “to prance ostentatiously.” Criticism,
one supposes, of a high-stepping style
which displays itself on the one spot
instead of pulling up sharply and getting
somewhere.
Well, I soon learned moderation in
style, and thus began an association
which for unbroken weekly regularity till
now can hardly have been equalled—cer-
tainly not by anyone else operating at
a distance of 1000 miles from the George-
street base. Yet verbiage was the taste
of that day ; and if I “cavorted” it was
in good company.
S. TALBOT SMITH.
A Satchel of Books
Scotland's Capital, by W. F. Arbuckle
(Chambers ; Is. 6d.), is a child’s history of
Edinburgh. Its beginnings as a vast rock
surrounded by woods and marshes, the
battles against the English, Flodden, the
sufferings of the Covenanters, and short
notes about the city’s famous men from
Scott to Lister and Haig are compressed
into 126 large-type pages.
The Great Barrier Reef is No. 3 of the
Shakespeare Head nature books, which
are published at 2s. each under the
general editorship of David G. Stead.
The marine zoologist E. M. Embury
was responsible for this production,
which, in addition to an account, in
simple language, of the way coral reefs
come into being, has many small
drawings and reproductions of photo-
graphs of the crabs, shells, anemones,
corals and birds of the world’s most
famous reef.
Lieutenant James Cook, by Frederick
Watson (Angus and Robertson ; 2s. 6d.),
is designed to clear up the “element of
mystery” surrounding “the accepted story
of the voyage on the eastern coast of
Australia.” Dr. Watson comes to the
sensational conclusion that the records
of the Endeavour voyage were largely
written in London “under official instruc-
tion and censorship,” so that England
might lay claim to Australia “by prior
right of discovery,” though it was the
opinion of the Admiralty that “the Dutch
or some other nation were the first dis-
coverers.” He supports his theories with
a wealth of documentary evidence.
D. H. Souter’s Australian Bush-Babs
(Endeavour Press ; 25.) is profusely illus-
trated by the author. This one appears
under a spirited drawing of a kangaroo :
The kangaroo is a splendid jumper ;
Short forelegs, but its tail is a thumper.
Whether it be a girl or a boy
A baby ’roo is always a joey.
Its Ma has a pocket in front of her turn
For baby to lie in, sucking its thumb.
Of all the babes that are born, but few
Have a pram like the baby kangaroo.
“The Man from Menindie,” which won
a Bulletin prize for the best Australian
nursery rhyme, is included in the collec-
tion.
The Endeavour Press has republished,
at 3s. 6d., Robert Kaleski’s Australian
Barkers and Biters, one of the most in-
formative little dog-books ever written. It
is 15 years since copies of this work were
obtainable in an Australian shop, but
they are often seen in dog-fanciers’
homes and in station libraries and offices.
Among the many interesting theories
which the author advances, and supports
by reference to high authorities, is the
view that our dingo is the world’s first
dog. He chats fascinatingly in his racy,
bush style of the dingo’s habits, and he
has some equally fascinating stuff (with
photographs) about cattle-dogs. He
thinks Alsatians will prove to be Aus-
tralia’s most dangerous pests, and ex-
plains why. This book is a literary
oddity ; a scientific treatise of consider-
able importance, with a laugh on every
page or so.
The Countryman, which is published
quarterly in Idbury (Oxon.) at 2s. 6d.,
has a vivid article entitled “An Aus-
tralian Drought,” by Arthur W. Upfield,
in the current issue. Also some home
truths about wheat. Under the wheat
quota British farmers are getting some-
thing under 20s. per quarter; but in
Australia, Canada, etc., “wheat is being
sold at about half the cost of its produc-
tion, and surely the morality of basing
our agricultural or any policy on starva-
tion prices is questionable.” There is a
fascinating article (“By Road Forty Years
Ago”) on the primitive roads and inns
of mid-Victorian England.
The Economic Resources of Australia,
by H. L. Harris (Angus and Robertson ;
3s. 6d.). Professor Harris has compressed
into 119 pages most of the facts and
figures regarding the wealth of Aus-
tralia. He begins with the primary eco-
nomic controls; goes on to discuss agri-
culture, the pastoral industries, etc., and
concludes with a survey of such assets
as irrigation, railways and the secondary
industries. He points out, amongst other
thought-stimulating ideas, that urbanisa-
tion is a sign of social progress.
To bewail the drift to the towns is to deplore
the fact that man has so completely mastered
the arts of production.
He also mentions that in modefn Aus-
tralia employers have larger families
than employees. In other words, the
population is growing, economically, at
the right end.
Two Years of the Japan-China Unde-
clared War, by Edward Bing-Shuey Lee
(Mercury Press; Dymock’s; 10s. 6d.).
This account of the Sino-Japanese crisis
by a well-known Chinese journalist is so
biased that it has little historical value.
It is like reading a study of Czarism by
a Bolshevik. But to those who only
warft to hear the case against Japan in
Manchuria it has many points of in-
terest. The author begins with the
rivalry between Russia and Japan in
Manchuria and carries his grim story on,
with much documentary evidence and
many incriminating photographs, to the
withdrawal of Japan from the League of
Nations. With the Appendices the work
runs to over 600 pages.
The League in Our Time, by Kathleen
Gibberd (Basil Blackwell; 3s. 6d.), begins
on a dramatic note:
One night in 1917 I stood in the road of a
completely darkened suburb and listened to a
terrible cry of exultation from all over London
as a German aeroplane was seen to catch fire
and fall slowly down the sky in burning pieces.
She believes that war and its horrors can
be abolished, as slavery and child labor
were abolished in England, and that the
League will do it if pacifists like herself
are sufficiently militant. She has the
faith which is supposed to move moun-
tains. She believes that the League can
prevent drug-taking, though the drug-
addicts of Egypt, for example, number
half a million in a population of
13,000,000. The case for the League is
argued in crystal-clear language and with
passionate earnestness, but the average
student of frail human nature will re-
main cynical. Half the royalties of this
interesting book go to the Peace Move-
ment.
The Valiant Pilgrim, by Anna Kingsley
(Cassell; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.). Mar ’lyza’s
father became a General during the Civil
War, and lost his money. So she had a
hard childhood. Then she met and mar-
ried handsome John Farrell, actor, and
her troubles began in earnest. But her
life Wasn’t all gloom ; far from it. Her
adventures are traced from St. Louis to
New York, and on to London, where
John becomes a successful writer. Her
children are shown growing up, marry-
ing and having their sorrows, and then
the end comes. The story shows know-
ledge of life and character, and the sen-
timentalism is never allowed to get out
of hand.
Love in Apron Strings, by Elizabeth
Hoy (Hodder and Stoughton ; Dymock’s ;
55.). Molly Fairweather, a sweet coun-
try girl, is driven by poverty to become a
probationer at St. Joseph’s Hospital,
London, 5.E.5. Part of the story is in
narrative, part in the form of letters to
her beloved Aunt Martha. Peter wants
to kiss her after a party.
“Oh, Peter, I can’t!” she said unhappily.
“Please don’t ask me. I’m —I’m not the kissing
sort. I don’t kiss easily.”
Not in any sense a modern lass, you see,
and poor Peter is not the strong, splendid
being who wins her in the end.
The Trading Post, by Milton Krims
(Eldon Press ; Dymock’s ; 7s. 6d.). The
action starts in the New York law office
where old Mr. Queeps is employed. He
gets sacked for befriending the boy Felix
and they light out together for the Wild
West. The excitement begins almost at
once and culminates in a battle in de-
fence of the right at the end of which
the bad men are not only thrashed but
made ridiculous. There are some un-
usual features, one being that the heroes
are all comic characters. It should make
a grand movie.
Life and Lucille, by Linda Littlejohn
(N.S.W. Bookstall Co.; 3s. 6d.), reads
like the first third of a trilogy. In the
course of 280 pages Lucille, an English
girl, gets married to Philip; enters the
House of Commons; runs away to Syd-
ney with Dick; reigns in that inquisi-
tive city as a social queen for two years
before being exposed by a scandal-sheet
(she would have been lucky to remain
unexposed for two weeks); leaves Dick
(who presently takes up with Fatima, an
Arab girl in Algiers, and is poisoned);
tries to make it up with Philip, fails and
faces life afresh. The style is easy; the
women-characters, except Fatima, are
life-like, and the men are dummies.
Lucille is particularly good, and a further
instalment of her adventures should be
interesting.

OUR SAVIOURS!
The Prime Minister is still pained at the
criticism to which he and his political
friends and friendly enemies have been
subjected since the salary grab. He
blames the newspapers for it all, though,
in point of fact, scores of organisations
unconnected with newspapers have dis-
cussed the grab and not one has sup-
ported it. Mr. Lyons “cannot conceive
of anything that could do more harm to
this country or to its prospects of re-
covery from the depression than the
destruction of the confidence of the
people in their representatives in the
national Parliament” ; but surely it is for
the said representatives to justify that
confidence by their actions and utter-
ances. Let us see how they respond to
the test in the matter of the grab.
Mr. Lyons introduced his Budget on
October 4. In it he said that the situa-
tion was improving, especially in the
wool industry ; but that industry had “felt
the full force of the depression and
would need some time to recover from
the effects.” Unemployment had come
down from 30 p.c. in the second quarter
of 1932 to 25.7 p.c. in the corresponding
quarter of 1933 ; obviously, “much re-
mained to be done.” As for Govern-
ment finance, while the Commonwealth
had wound up the year with a surplus
of £3,546,100, the States had deficits
amounting to £8,600,000 and anticipated
deficits amounting to £8,500,000 in
1933-34.
Deficits were by no means peculiar
to the States. The Commonwealth itself
had had a litter of them totalling
£17,216,000, and because it was urgently
necessary to reduce taxation he was bud-
geting for another and prepared for more.
The estimated deficits for 1933-34 and 1934-
35 aggregate £4,848,000, and will absorb prac-
tically the whole of the excess receipts for the
last two years, £4,860,000.
The Budget speech was remarkable for
omissions, some of which were rectified
by other speakers. For example, no
reference was made to the growth of
the public debt from £1,104,000,000 in
1929 to £1,204,600,000 in 1933 or to the
existence of the floating debt —
£84,000,000, practically all contracted
during the depression. Then Mr. Lyons
did not point out that there would have
been no surplus the last two years but for
the war-debt moratorium granted by
Britain, and that he was making no pro-
vision for interest owing (£5,013,200 in
1931-32 and £4,915,200 in 1932-33) or
for resumption of the payments. It was
also remarked that there was nothing in
the Budget for the wheatgrowers, who
last year received bounties amounting to
£2,250,000 and are now worse off than
ever. Nor was any hint given that the
Government was of a mind to increase
the allowances of members, Ministers,
Opposition-leaders and officers of the
House. Mr. Lyons did not mention the
subject.
Nearly all the Budget proposals were
incorporated in the Financial Relief Bill.
A Labor member moved that the bill
should be withdrawn and redrafted to
provide for “complete restoration of the
percentage reductions in public-service
salaries, wages, pensions and social ser-
vices.” The Prime Minister asked the
House to reject the amendment, say-
ing, among other things, that it was
the Government’s desire that “the bene-
fits of the measure may be made avail-
able to those concerned as quickly as
possible,” that “additional restoration of
moneys would necessarily involve a
greater deficit,” and that “no Govern-
ment had any right to take from the tax-
payers one penny more than was neces-
sary for the maintenance of public
finance.” That was about half-past nine
on the night of October 19.
The measure said to be so urgent was
not passed that night, although, except for
an interval of half an hour, the House
sat all night. Contrary to precedent, it
did not even adjourn next morning for
breakfast. A little after noon the same
Mr. Lyons, who had been so keen on
having the measure passed without
amendment and so set against any in-
crease of the anticipated deficit, himself
introduced two new clauses swelling the
allowances of members by £75 p.a. and
those of the nine Ministers of State from
£10,710 in the aggregate to £12,240.
What occurred in the ■ meantime to
effect such a change in the gentleman’s
attitude? Nothing, he declares.
It has been suggested that something hap-
pened secretly in the night-time. That is
entirely untrue.
Mr. Holman, however, while denying
some newspaper reference to “a midnight
meeting of members of Parliament,”
admits that there was a meeting:
No gathering of members of Parliament, but
only of members of the Government party.
The Prime Minister did us the honor to in-
vite us to his room to exchange views with
him. Several members of this party presented
their views, I among them.
And these “views” prevailed, though
it was left to an obscure member of the
Opposition to take the initiative in the
House. As the event proved, members
of all the groups were in the grab, but
the most contemptible part in it was
played by the U.A.P.
Australia believes that members should
be paid, but it never bargained for any-
thing like this. It never thought that
payment of members would result in the
infliction on it of a breed of politicians
so lost to all sense of the fitness of things
as to raise the cry that they cannot live
on £750 a year when scores of thousands
of decent families have to live on a pound
a week and less,and so brazen and greedy
as to vote themselves another £9765 a
year when one-fourth of the trade-union-
ists are unemployed, when 60,000 wheat-
growers are on the rocks and when the
nation is going to the bad at the rate,
loans and war-debt obligations included,
of something like 30 millions a year. And
when these custodians of the public
purse are criticised they squeal like stuck
pigs. But their attempts at a reasoned
defence of their political piracy are more
nauseating, if that is possible, than their
sound and fury.
Mr. Lyons argued that Parliament had
a right to distribute another £9765 p.a.
among Ministers and members because
£3OOO was being given to Kingsford
Smith.
If we are justified in granting that sum to a
distinguished aviator, surely it is not improper
to restore a mere £9OOO to the 112 members who
have saved this country.
“Saved this country”! Not the wool-
growers and the wheatgrowers and the
cattlemen and the cow-farmers and the
manufacturers and their work-people, not
the banks and the insurance societies and
the investors and the taxpayers, but the
politicians at Canberra! And not the
Lyons group only but the Scullin group
and the Beasley group, one of which Mr.
Lyons quitted because Australia under
its palsied rule was, he declared, drifting
to destruction, and the other he stig-
matised as standing for default and rebel-
lion. Not Robert Gibson of the Com-
monwealth Bank and his board, but the
wild men they stood up against and the
weak men whose backs they stiffened —
these (now that they have joined in the
salary grab) are saviours of the country!
Bruce would not have done this thing,
nor would he have suffered it to be done.
THIS LAND OF HUDDLE.
The Commonwealth census, the taking
of which was delayed for two years on
the score of economy, has shown that
6,630,000 whites live in the States and
Territories. The number has increased by
1,800,000 since the year before the war.
That doesn’t look so bad, but it is the
best that can be said.
Victoria and N. S. Wales, which to-
gether form one-seventh of the continent,
have two-thirds of the people. The
Northern Territory, which is one-sixth of
Australia, holds 4800 whites. In the
whole of the vast area north of the Tropic
of Capricorn only 300,000 Europeans
live, most of them huddled on the eastern
coast. Almost the whole of Cape York,
of eastern Arnhem Land and of the Kim-
berleys is empty of settlement.
No town 300 miles from the coast, out-
side a few impermanent mining cities,
boasts 5000 inhabitants. West of a line
drawn from Cape York to the Murray-
above Melbourne, only 45,000 whites live
in western Queensland and western N. S.
Wales, and over 30,000 of those are in
the three mineral centres of Broken Hill,
Mt. Isa and Cloncurry. Between the
most western dot in the eastern States
marking a district with 5000 popula-
tion, and the most eastern dot in the
western States of similar significance,
2000 miles intervenes on the map.
More than half the people are
crammed into seven cities. What the
drift has been in the past quarter of a
century may be judged by a glimpse at
the figures for 1909 and 1933.
City. Pop. 1909. Pop. 1933. Increase.
Sydney .. .. 605,290 1,262,440 657,150
Melbourne .. 562,300 1,028,300 466,000
Brisbane .. 143,077 334,000
Adelaide .. 184,393 326,032 14 ,639
Perth .. .. 54,354 208,500 154,146
Hobart .. .. 38,916 58,750 19,834
Newcastle .. 66,500 103,700 37,200
Total 7 cities 1,654,830 3,321,722 1,666,892
The population of Australia has in-
creased 2,256,000 in the period. The
population outside the seven biggest cities
in 1909 was 2,618,060 out of a total of
4,374,000 ; to-day it is roughly 3,308,300
out of 6,630,000. In other words:
Increase
Increase in population approx, p.c.
of seven cities .. .. 1,666,000 100.6
Increase in rural districts 690,240 27
Some rural districts, especially those in
which a great deal of horse labor for-
merly was used, actually carry less popu-
lation than a generation ago. Says the
N. S. Wales Government Statistician:
The number of persons permanently engaged
in agriculture in 1929-30 was 36 p.c. less than
in years immediately preceding the war, although
the area under crop is greater.
Whereas in 1912-13 in N. S. Wales one
person was employed to every 62.3 acres
agriculturally used, in 1931 the figure
was down to 180.7 acres. If the 1912-13
basis of employment had been main-
tained, roughly 76,000 persons more than
the actual number should be employed
directly in agriculture in N. S. Wales,
earning about £7,000,000 per annum.
These would be apart from those main-
tained in country towns by the stimula-
tion of their local spending power.
While every country has suffered to a
certain extent from changed rural labor
conditions, no other country suffers from
our stupid sort of huddle. London holds
only 11.01 p.c. of Englishmen, Berlin
6.37 p.c. of Germans. Rome is smaller
than Sydney, though it is the capital and
largest city of a nation of 42,000,000
people. It contains 2.33 p.c. of the people
of Italy. In Sydney there are nearly
50 p.c. of the New South Welshmen,
in Melbourne 58 p.c. of the Vic-
torians, in Adelaide 55.5 p.c. of the South
Australians.
The populations of the two biggest
cities in Canada —which has 4,000,000
people more than Australia —are re-
spectively 818,000 and 631,000. The
Dominion has no others above 160,000.
The provinces in which it is best pos-
sible to study contrasts with our own con-
ditions are the new ones. Saskatchewan
(Canada) is as big as the Riverina. In
1901 it had a population of 91,000. It
became a province in 1905, and, though
it has few minerals and its main resources
are wheat and dairying, its census of
921,000 inhabitants in 1931 was equal
to that of Queensland. But in growing
it did not develop big towns. Its capital,
Regina, possesses 53,000 inhabitants. In
Saskatoon 43,000 live. Moosejaw thrives
on 21,000, and four other towns each
have between 5000 and 6000 people.
More than 73 p.c. of the population
is rural.
The fiscal results of this spreading
show how desirable subdivision and local
development of Australian areas could
be. Saskatchewan has 8601 miles of
railway which the province does not
own —it must thank its stars for it if it
peruses Australian financial tables.
Five thousand miles of tourist roads,
25,000 miles of market roads and 177,000
miles of feeder access roads to farms
have been formed or graded. Yet the
total revenue charged upon its in-
habitants seems to be in the region
of £15,000,000 p.a. —• local revenue
£3,600,000, to which must be added 80
cents per inhabitant Federal subsidy,
municipal rates of £6,000,000, and
Federal revenue, mostly customs and
excise, about £5,000,000 p.a.
Leaving out its business undertakings,
Queensland in 1931 collected £20,000,000
in State and municipal revenue alone,
and it was responsible—on the per capita
basis —for at least £8,000,000 in Com-
monwealth claims as well.
The reason for the difference is not far
to seek. The Canadian province, decen-
tralised and ruralised, has no cities like
Brisbane eating their heads off with debts
of £6O per head of population. No huge
amounts have been put into suburban
speedways, huge sewerage schemes such
as are necessary to serve big populations
and equally * expensive urban transport.
There are no underground railways or
£10,000,000 Harbor bridges.
Australia will have to try to grow
Saskatchewans, and not more Sydneys.
MACQUARIE-STREET DRAMA.
That the dying moments of the nominee
Leg. Council of N. S. Wales should have
been devoted to a discussion about rail-
way sleepers was highly appropriate, in
view of the log-rolling which character-
ised the election of the first batch of
Ms.L.C. to the reformed Upper House.
That election was a dramatic affair —a
show in the best Nat Gould style. The
Premier, in his emotion, broke his lead
pencil. Mr. Lang, receiving his ballot
paper, stood up and delivered the
sort of speech which the condemned
man makes as the hangman puts his hand
on the lever. Mr. T. G. Murray caused
a stir when he discovered somebody in
the counting-room taking notes. On-
lookers waited an hour and forty minutes
in suspense before they knew for certain
that Mr. Bassett had not smothered him-
self in a nook with his ballot paper.
Police patrolled the building in regi-
ments under the command of a Deputy
Commissioner to warn off people who
were inclined to do a bit of s.-p. betting
at long odds qgainst themselves. Detec-
tives snooped in corners probing for
illicit ballot papers. When events paused,
members broke into insult with all the
verve of Sousa playing on a May morn-
ing. There w'as talk of sliding panels,
and of the possibility of Royal Commis-
sions on malpractice. A jolly day.
The Leg. Council Reform Act, as
everybody knows who read Mr. Stevens’s
message before the referendum, was de-
signed to “ensure the supremacy of the
people’s will for all time, to restore the
prestige of Parliament and improve the
credit of the State.” It was to remove
“the fear of dictatorship, whether Fascist
or Soviet.” Mr. Lyons concurred in Mr.
Stevens’s view. He said, “as a student
of democracy,” that by voting Yes
electors would “insure the people’s
homes, rights and privileges against inva-
sion,” and that the new House would
“stand as a real interpreter of the per-
sistent will of the people.” Mr. Manning,
the Attorney-General, said that the bill
would make the popular will decisive.
He added that it was a “measure of the
utmost simplicity.”
Simple the first election was not. The
ballot paper was so complicated that ten
noble minds were not equal to marking
it correctly. It took the average member
anything from ten minutes to an hour
and a half to indicate his preferences.
The returning officers spent a couple
of days and nights wallowing in mathe-
matics—checking papers, multiplying
votes by a thousand and adding one and
dividing by the number of voters plus
one, transferring second preferences and
performing other erudite operations be-
fore the pioneer fifteen were chosen —
the last one at the end of the fifty-third
count.
It was promised that existing groups
should be represented in the reformed
Chamber according to their respective
strengths. No party proved able to con-
trol its voting members. The first man to
get a quota of 12.12 votes necessary to
elect him was Mr. T. G. Murray. Mr.
Murray romped home, with John Peden,
President of the nominee House, a poor
second, just coming out of the straight.
Mr. Murray, as “S. M. Herald” puts it,
“at the present time is an active member
of the U.A.P.” Previously he was Dooley
Labor, Lang Labor and Loughlin Labor.
Nosing up to the stirrup of Mr. Peden
was little Ernie Farrar, another old-
time goer, accused by his former Labor
friends of being politically by Chameleon
out of Opportunity. Following closely
on these three giants of the primaries
came two dark horses —both Indepen-
dents. One was Mr. Trautwein, a sport-
ing publican, who raced a horse called
Quinologist.
Mr. Trautwein has had no political
experience, but he has made public
appearances. lustice Halse Rogers sat as
a Royal Commission on Mr. Trautwein
and others. His Honor gave Mr. Traut-
wein the following reference:
Trautwein proved an unsatisfactory wit-
ness and... .untruthful. I came to the con-
clusion that Trautwein received £3OOO for the
definite purpose of securing immunity from
prosecution [of publicans with fruit machines
installed], and that he did take steps to procure
the desired immunity. What Trautwein did with
the money cannot be said.
Mr. Trautwein dead-heated with a
country storekeeper, Mr. Alam, who has
been pro-Lang and anti-Lang. Neither
the U.A.P. nor the C.P. was supposed to
have any use for him. Yet five per cent,
of the voters suddenly discovered that
Mr. Alam was the man for Galway or
Beyrout, or wherever the place is.
Mr. Whiddon, who wins the State Lot-
tery every week or so, is not the reposi-
tory of all the luck in N. S. Wales.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Belgium Retaliates.
W. M. Hughes hurled a clumsy gibe at
Belgium when the House of Reps, was
discussing the duties on glass.
It is a question whether a Belgian or an Aus-
tralian industry should be encouraged. Aus-
tralia owes Belgium nothing. There are more
Australian soldiers lying in Belgian soil than
Belgium itself lost during the war. I wouldn’t
go a yard to help Belgium or any other foreign
country. I will register my vote on behalf of
my fellow-citizens.
Others might say—as Hughes himself
said once—that the little people who
fought for independence and the sanctity
of treaties against the mightiest of mili-
tarist Powers, accepting all the horrors
and miseries that resistance entailed,
were responsible for one of the high
heroic deeds of history ; but the war is
over and politicians are a forgetful lot.
Hughes apologised subsequent to the
Belgian Consul making a dignified pro-
test, but apparently the insult rankled.
We owe the Belgians a lot in terms of
trade. In the years before the depression
they bought approximately £9,000,000
worth of our goods every year, and we
bought £900,000 worth of theirs. Since
the imposition of the Scullin tariff Bel-
gian purchases from us have dwindled to
£3,600,000 a year, and our purchases
from Belgium have fallen to £280,000
a year. The loss has certainly
been on our side. Now, taking a
leaf out of our book, Belgium has estab-
lished her prohibition—against Aus-
tralian barley, of which it has been buy-
ing about £300,000 worth per annum, and
beef, of which it bought heaps for its
army: mostly South Aus. barley and
Westralian beef, for which there are not
many buyers in the world. This action
is in line with that which other countries
have applied to wheat.
It would be very pleasant if Australia
could dictate to the world and compel
other countries to buy our vital exports
while we flatly refuse to buy theirs.
But the time has gone by when this could
be done or when tariff-making could
be left in the hands of politicians who
cannot see beyond their noses. There
has to be give and take, as we shall
learn from sad experience if somebody
at Canberra does not discover the word
“reciprocity” in the dictionary.

In Full Retreat.
The firm determination of the Lyons
Government to protect itself and its
members from what Parkhill called the
“swinish” attacks of the press on salary-
grabbers seems to be faltering. So long
as it was merely a matter of seizing a
working journalist or two there seemed
to be no difficulties in the way. But, the
Prime Minister being called to Tasmania,
his blundering deputy suggested that the
right people to deal with were a body of
directors. Then somebody recalled that
those directors included the chairman of
the advisory council which financed and
managed the N. S. Wales section of the
campaign that put the Lyons Govern-
ment into power. Other powerful
supporters were included.
From the moment this was realised the
taste for punitive measures began to
wane and the Government seemed doubt-
ful about its powers. The material parts
of the relevant section in the Constitution
read:
49. —The powers, privileges and immunities of
the Senate and of the House of Representatives
....shall be such as are declared by Parlia-
ment, and until declared shall be those of the
Cmnmons House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom.... at the establishment of the Com-
monwealth.
The Government has now been advised
that no action can be taken against the
offenders without special legislation.
The section seems clear enough. In
effect the Commonwealth Parliament has
powers equivalent to those of the House
of Commons until it takes other powers.
John Quick, one of the fathers of Federa-
tion, and Robert Garran, until recently
Commonwealth Solicitor - General, in
their digest of the Constitution Bill
wrote:
This section authorises the Federal Parliament,
by an ordinary act of legislation, to declare what
shall be the powers, privileges and immunities
0f.... the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives .... In the absence of such legis-
lation the powers, privileges and immunities of
each House... .will be those of the House of
Commons, as known to law at the establishment
of the Commonwealth.
But other times, other manners. Other
Crown Law officers, other opinions.
And discretion is the better part of valor.

Flats in Toorak.
Melbourne is growing a superior-slum
problem like Sydney. The location is
Toorak. Builders have been rushing up
enormous flats and reconditioning old
boom palaces until Yarraville’s classiest
suburb threatens to be a congested area
like Darlinghurst. One of the attractions
of the new flats is that dwellers therein
can give their addresses as “Toorak,”
and that is as good as a fur coat to a
typist.
The Health Commission, which looks
with disfavor on the new development, is
practically powerless to deal with it. A
Building Regulation Bill for the suburbs
was once prepared for Parliament, but
that august body was plunged in deep
slumber at the time, or something, and
it was never presented. Now the muni-
cipalities have their own regulations, and,
as they are keen competitors with one
another for any investment money float-
ing about, they are not too fussy about
such trifling matters as floorspace, air
and light.
Still, there are baths in the new domi-
ciles, which is more than can be said for
some of the less tony areas of Greater
Melbourne.

Queensland Lands.
Whatever faults Queensland Govern-
ments may have, they certainly get things
done through their departments. The
Lands Department, controlled by a board
of which the active W. P. Payne is chair-
man, has a fine record, and each year
adds to its prestige.
The department in 1932-33 opened
more land for settlement than in any
year since 1924 —5,166,495 acres, of
which all but 30,000 acres was
selected. It resumed 1,189,000 acres of
pastoral country for closer settlement —
the greatest area since 1925. Its road
work was the most extensive since 1919,
and it gave useful employment to 11,016
men. Forfeitures of land selected are
declining in spite of bad times —they
were 273, covering 360,283 acres, during
1932-33, as against 797, embracing
2,134,728 acres, in 1927.
While other State forestry departments
have been living in penury and despair,
Queensland’s tree branch was able to
proclaim 428,893 acres of reserves and
national parks and to plant-out 1,020,000
trees in reafforestation areas. It has
2,900,000 trees in nurseries ready for
future planting-out. And forestry re-
venue increased 85 per cent in 1932-33.
Interim reports issued during the year
took a gloomy view of the sheep indus-
try. The annual review points out that
prices at Brisbane sales improved so
substantially as to show an increase of
73.4 per cent, on the all-Australian
average of the last selling season. At
the same time, the board says that the
industry has a lot of leeway to make up,
and concessions—which include lease-
period extensions to holders of 55,000,000
acres and rent reductions of over
£325,000 —must be continued for some
years.
One of the biggest jobs on hand is
re-establishment of prickly-pear lands.
About 16,000,000 acres will have been re-
settled inside two years.
The total area of Queensland is
429,120,000 acres. This now includes
323,000,000 acres of pastoral leases and
27,000,000 acres of alienated or partly
alienated land, with 57,500,000 acres un-
occupied. The latter is mainly rough,
mountainous country in Cape York and
in the Gulf and Selwyn Range districts.
The State is as widely occupied as any
country in the world, though not as in-
tensively, which is a remarkable achieve-
ment when it is remembered that 89
years ago its total population was 1500,
half in Brisbane, and that its stock con-
sisted of 650 horses, 13,000 cattle and
184,000 sheep.
Australia has some departments which
are unnecessary and some which are in-
efficient. This is a department which is
both necessary and efficient.

Utopia, Unlimited.
The Lang party does not lack hide. Its
new socialisation-of-credit policy, ex-
plained in the form of questions and
answers in a pamphlet, proves its kin-
ship to the rhino.
One of the questions is “Does Labor
policy involve Communism?” The
A.L.P. answers “definitely no”; its con-
trollers, one, at least, of whom was an
avowed Communist, say that while Lang
Labor would “eliminate capitalist rob-
bery and plunder, this does not mean
that the individual is to be deprived of
his personal property.”
The Soviet Union itself proved that such an
idea is fallacious in actual practice.
So says Mr. Garden, who did so much
to propagate the “fallacious idea” in
this country at the cost of turmoil and
misery. Garden and his present associates
want the people’s will exercised through
universal franchise, and will not tolerate
“minority excesses of either the Fascists,
financed by the bankers, or the Com-
munists, financed by interests not dis-
closed” —though Garden should know
them and disclose them.
Under “socialisation” will there be ex-
propriation and loss to depositors of
their money in the banks? No. All
that will happen will be that deposits,
assets, liabilities and everything will be
transferred to the Commonwealth Bank,
where they will be safe.
Deposits in private banks are never safe, being
always liable to a run, resulting in the bank
having to sacrifice its assets in an endeavor to
secure liquidity.
Shades of the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment Savings Bank, many of whose de-
positors had to “sacrifice their assets”
for 10s. 6d. and 11s..in the pound!
Capitalistic banks, it seems, don’t hold
sufficient cash to honor their obligations.
They “hold only £25,000,000 against
£500,000,000 in deposits.” But the Com-
monwealth Bank could meet obligations
in full “through the note-issue branch,”
and all deposits, when Lang and Garden
have them tucked away in the C. 8., will
have “100 per cent, protection and cover,
instead of the existing 5 per cent.”
Credit, of course, is to be made avail-
able in oceans —to employ the unem-
ployed and provide a decent standard
of living by “increasing consumer capac-
ity.” “Labor,” it is inferred, will make
two, three, four or five notes grow where
one grew before, but this is not men-
tioned ; Lang Labor has a certain
modesty in these matters. And the
credit resources of the nation will be
managed by the most competent execu-
tives available.
Labor will no longer tolerate the inefficient
management of amateurs, such as in many in-
stances are controlling the banks to-day.
Instead of inefficient amateurs like
Davidson, there will be efficient pro-
fessionals like Lang and Garden. They
will guarantee stabilised price-levels
for all primary produce; they will
scatter enough paper money to buy
everything produced; they will release
mortgages from the grip of the private
bankers, reduce interest-rates, stop ex-
ploitation and give the producers con-
trol of marketing. Consumers? No
mention of how they will fare ; but con-
sumers are expected to vote for Lang
Labor, anyhow.
On the whole, it is a thin policy, less
exciting than any of the string of Lang
Plans which have gone before and been
found wanting. It comes strangely from
tongues which a year or two ago were
urging the people to “press on to com-
plete socialisation, not only of money
but of all the means of production.”

An Aid to Morals.
“El V.”: The film censor doesn’t say
much about the films he bans, but they
must be pretty bad if they are worse
than some he doesn’t ban. Here’s a
specimen I saw the other night. It had
only two characters which were held up
as really objectionable—a clergyman
who refused to help a starving girl
(she looked as fat as butter under the
glycerine) and a relief-bureau person
who wouldn’t feed the same lass. The
film was called “Blondie Johnson,” and
its plot went like this:
(1) Attractive young woman, mother dead of
starvation, starts to make her fortune by stand-
ing in front of speakeasies and persuading
drunks to give her ten dollars to take her to a
distant hospital—she says she works there. This
occupation is presented as one in which any
reasonably smart girl might engage.
(2) Attractive young woman meets, issuing
from speakeasy, gum-chewing person with a
mouth like a shark. He wins her affection by
abusing her, stamping on her feet and sub-
jecting her to other underworld courtesies. He
turns out to be “side-kick to the big noise” in
local racketeering.
(3) By posing as the sick wife of a Yid with
ears like cauliflowers and a face like Boggo-
road, who is charged with murder, and thus
working on the feelings of a Yank jury, she
wins the good graces of the gang and is admitted
to a life of opulence in surroundings which
make even a talkie palace seem dull. Her
elevation is made to look as if it were the
natural reward of merit. Only “de big noise”
doesn’t like it because she is seeing too much
of a hero —the lad with the shark mouth and
chewing plug. Gang leader proceeds to “give
him de w'oicks,” but is foiled by the heroine,
who has him smartly machine-gunned. Now
she forms her own gang and lives in circum-
stances to make the heart of every hungry shop-
girl who sees her yearn to be like her.
(4) Hero, having married another girl, a mere
actress with no murders to her credit, and
therefore an unpleasant character, is sus-
pected of having spilled the beans about the
degenerate Yid, who is to stand his second
trial for murder with no chance of escaping
the hot spot. Heroine arranges to have him
shot up, too. Discovering at the last moment
that he is innocent, she rushes to his quarters,
to find that her two-gun experts, who have
been shooting at him for two or three minutes
in a ten-by-twelve room with .45 automatics,
have inflicted only a flesh wound or so.
(5) Gangs are rounded up, and she gets six
years. One is left with the feeling that the
Law is unjust. Shark-faced hero is seen parting
with the lady as he goes to get his six years.
She adjures him while he is waiting for her
“not to do anything she wouldn’t do herself!”
The moral seems to be that, so long
as you repent in the end and are resigned
to serving six years, machine-gunning,
fraud, lying and theft are nothing in
one’s young life.
And our Whites and Fordes interdict
the novels of Norman Lindsay!
«
U.S.A.’s Gold-buying Experiment.
The declared aim behind President
Roosevelt’s decision to bid up (in paper
dollars) for gold is to help in the restora-
tion of price-levels, and then to establish
and maintain the dollar, which “will not
change its purchasing or debt-paying
power during succeeding generations.”
The thing looks very like Profes-
sor Irving Fisher’s well-known proposal
for a compensated dollar, designed to
counteract changes in the purchasing
power of gold by periodically altering
the gold value of the monetary unit. The
gold standard would be maintained, but
not in its old form ; gold would be tied
to the currency unit instead of the cur-
rency unit to gold. To some extent this
is what has already happened in those
countries which have gone off gold ; the
trouble has been that traders, lacking
confidence in the future of commodities,
have failed to use more than a fraction
of the credit available.
By itself, the rise in the price of gold
has not lifted either the British or Aus-
tralian wholesale price-level; though it
can be fairly claimed that it has
helped to mitigate the severity of the
fall in the wholesale indexes. It is the
external more than the internal value of
a currency which is affected by a rise in
the price of gold. So, whatever gains
there may be in this connection come
chiefly through exports. But the U.S.A.
already has a favorable commodity trade
balance. Further, will the sterling and
gold groups remain inert to the possible
inroads of a falling dollar upon their
trade activities? If they do not, then
the U.S.A.’s gold-buying plan may fail
in its purpose.
What effect continued depreciation of
the dollar would have upon sterling and
other European prices depends chiefly
upon what action may be taken by the
sterling and gold groups to defend their
home and foreign markets. It is too
early yet to form any .worth-while opinion
as to exactly what will happen. President
Roosevelt declares that he does not want
to start a currency war. There is, how-
ever, a danger that the strains and pulls
of the new device may not be well
balanced. If sterling further depreciated,
the tendency would be for sterling and the
Australian pound to come closer to-
gether, unless, of course, the Australian
pound is kept pegged at a given distance
from sterling.
Subject to all this, further depreciation
of the dollar would make Australian
wool dearer to buyers from the U.S.A.,
American motor-cars would cost less in
Australian notes, the Federal and Queens-
land Governments, which have borrowed
in New York, would benefit, while the
U.S.A.’s wheatgrowers would be able to
undersell, without direct Government
subsidy, Australian, Canadian and Argen-
tine growers in the world’s markets,
including Eastern Asia.

Victoria’s Transport Problem.
Vic. railway revenue has been declin-
ing at a great rate, but the Argyle
Government hopes to do better when the
Transport (Control and Co-ordination)
Bill becomes law —if it does. The
measure has had a stormy passage in the
Assembly. It struggled through commit-
tee last week, after a sitting of 16 hours,
extending from 4.15 p.m. to 8 a.m. This
performance was preceded by bargain-
ing with the Agrarians. Labor was not
aggressive, and was able to score one or
two points.
The chief modifications were accept-
ance of a board of three, against whose
decisions (on law points only) an appeal
may be made to the Supreme Court, and
exemption of motor trucks up to two
tons capacity. Parliament, and not the
Ministry, is to have the final say in the
closing or reopening of railway lines, and
a ban has been placed on carrying goods
for hire (with certain exemptions) on
Sundays.
The board chairman, who is to be of
as independent and impartial a brand as
can be found, is to get £1250 p.a., and
the others (a farmer and a business man)
£BOO each.
The third reading in the Assembly is
to be taken to-day (November 8). It is
expected that the remodelled and chas-
tened bill will be acceptable to the
gentlemen in the other House.


SOCIETY
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Wen”: The visit to Moree (N.S.W.)
watercourse, that paradise of bird-lovers,
by ornithologists was responsible for at
least one spirited protest. A Moree
cleric tells how an elderly spinster mem-
ber of his church came to see him and
urged that a protest be sent to the Gov-
ernment against the proposed invasion.
“But why?” asked the amazed clergy-
man. “These people are ornitho-
logists” “I know,” was the reply,
“and I’ve got no time for these new-
fangled cults. Think of the morals of
our young people.” “Why, they study
birds” began the cleric, only to be
cut short again. “Yes, and climb trees,
eat nuts and walk about in the —er —
nude. I’m surprised at you, of all
people, countenancing such goings-on!”
And an angry lady parishioner flounced
from the room.
“They say he married her for her money.”
“Yes, but he forgot to make it C.O.D.”
“Mudurup”: These periodical salary
grabs always excite resentment and
leave citizens gasping, but for sheer im-
pudence and unexpectedness a happen-
ing in Westralia just before Federation
remains in a class of its own. The Com-
monwealth Constitution had just made
provision for payment to members, the
innovation had been championed from
scores of platforms at State elections,
and finally Bigjohn Forrest decided that
the time had arrived when Assemblymen
should receive some sort of allowance.
So he introduced a bill to give them
£2OO a year, and it met with little opposi-
tion until it went up to the Council,
where some of the old diehards were ex-
pected to give it a rough passage. But
what the Upper House did was merely
to point out a fatal blemish in the
measure —there was no provision in it
for them. Politely but firmly, they re-
turned it to the people’s Chamber for
the omission to be rectified. It was in
vain that Forrest and his Ministers
pointed out that the Council consisted
of solid citizens elected on a property
franchise, that the question of paying
such had never before been advocated
even by themselves, that the whole thing
was preposterous. “All right,” the Coun-
cil said, “if we don’t get paid you shan't
either” —and the Government caved in.
Ever since then, and for obvious reasons,
the worth of a Westralian M.L.C. to his
country has always been precisely the
same as that of an M.L.A.
* * * *
“Jungor”: Although the Kalgoorlie
“Miner” was the only newspaper called
to account for alleging that a stand-up
fight had taken place between Assembly-
men (B. 1/11/’33), at least half a dozen
other goldfields journals published highly-
colored versions of the incident. One, 1
recall, flippantly headed the item “Late
Sporting.” And the Parliamentary re-
porter who set going the story of what
some bard of the period termed “the
mythical fight that was stopped by ficti-
tious police” wasn’t the only victim of a
Legislature bent on asserting its dignity.
A sub-inspector of police gave an inquisi-
tive roundsman a spirited version of the
fray that had reached his ears, and on
this officer, too, the hand of authority
descended. He was reduced in seniority
and transferred from Perth to a country
district.
sfc ❖ Hi *
“Citizen”: One of the reasons why
laymen who make contact with the law
get the impression that it is a large and
mysterious ass was exemplified at
Sydney Quarter Sessions. A civil ser-
vant was acquitted on a charge of mak-
ing a false declaration. Whether he
diverged from the truth or not didn’t
come into question. The J.P. who
witnessed the document gave evidence
that he put to the defendant the ques-
tion: “This is your handwriting and sig-
nature, and you swear the contents of
this document to be true?” ’Sonah said
that was the form of an oath, not of
a declaration, and as defendant hadn’t a
Bible in his hand when he said “Yes,”
and hadn’t taken an oath to tell the truth,
he must be held guiltless. I know noth-
ing about the intricacies of N. S. Wales
statute law, but I have had occasion to
make statutory declarations in Sydney on
many occasions, before various holders
of the Commission of the Peace. Always
the procedure was the same: “That your
name and signature?” “Yes.” “And
you swear to the truth of this?” “Yes.”
Whereupon the trusty and well-beloved
servant of King George inscribed his
moniker on the dotted line and (in at
least two cases) invited me to pop six-
pence or a bob in a little box devoted to
the upkeep of his pet charity. The temp-
tation to tell a lie in a declaration has
not yet assailed me, but it comes as a bit
of a shock to learn that if I had pre-
varicated every Judge in the State would
say I committed no offence.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: Interesting to me to read
that an anti-Jewish campaign has been
launched in South Africa with German
backing. The Hebrew has had a lot to
do with the making of the country, and
“Are wisdom teeth our last teeth?”
“No; shop teeth are.”
it mustn’t be thought that his activities
have been confined to the diamond- and
gold-fields ; as a storekeeper and hawker
he was scattered throughout Cape
Colony and the two erstwhile Boer re-
publics. Every little dorp had its Hebrew
merchant-cwra-moneylender, cwm-every-
thing else by which he could turn a
shilling ; and my experience mostly was
that they got on very well with the
Dutch, just as their more eminent com-
patriots in Kimberley or Johannesburg
did with their cosmopolitan trade and
mining rivals. Only in Natal has the Jew
never gained a solid footing. There, even
40 years ago, the pious Hindu began to
monopolise the small store and hawking
trade.

“Quot’* 1 : In England and Wales the
last census disclosed an excess of females
over males of about two millions. In
the Commonwealth,
with one-sixth of the
older land’s popula-
tion, the latest statis-
tics -disclose that
males outnumber
females by over
100,000, which ought
to be satisfactory to
those who regard
marriage as the pro-
per vocation for the
weaker sex. Vic-
toria is the only
State where women
predominate, and
that by a mere
13,000 in a popula-
tion of 1,820,360. In
S. Aus. the scales
are very evenly bal-
anced ; there are less
than a thousand
more males than
females in an aggre-
gate of over half a
million. The Speck
figures are a little
surprising, the island
having been vaguely
regarded as a place
liable to be a trifle
cluttered up with
womanhood owing
to so many of its
young men looking
for wider fields of
activity. But Tas. can show 115,141
males to 112,264 females, so there is still
a sufficiency of husbands to go round.

“Oxmead”: The Adam Lindsay Gor-
don centenary wasn’t suffered to pass
without the inevitable jarring sneer about
the poet having libelled Australia by
representing its birds as songless and its
flowers as scentless. Actually, of course,
he did nothing of the sort when he wrote
of “lands where bright blossoms are
scentless, And songless bright birds, ’
repeating the qualification with an em-
phasis that only dulness or carelessness
could fail to catch and note. Neverthe-
less, the stupid misrepresentation has had
such a long start that it is going to be
difficult to overtake. Partly, no doubt,
this is attributable to Marcus Clarke’s
purple-patched preface to Gordon’s col-
lected poems with its sweeping inaccura-
cies about “our trees without shade,”
“our flowers with perfume” and the rest
of it. But it seems hard that Gordon,
who knew and loved the bush and wrote
of it with rare discernment, should have
to suffer because Clarke’s Australia was
pretty well bounded by the two ends of
Melbourne’s best-known thoroughfares.
“Avon”: The entry into M.L.’s Par-
liament of Mrs. McCombs has brought
about one change in the domestic
arrangements of the Legislature. On the
door of “Bellamy’s,” the Parliamentary
restaurant, there has been, from time
immemorial, a notice “Ladies Not
Admitted.” This has been removed, and
if Mrs. McCombs likes to go there and
have a cup of tea she may do so. As she
is one of the Dominion’s leading prohi-
bitionists she isn’t likely to ask for any-
thing stronger. The place is called “Bel-
lamy’s,” by the way, because in the early
days members used to refresh themselves
at a pie-and-coffee stall kept by one
Edward Bellamy, who anchored it just
outside the precincts while Parliament
was in session.

“C.E.T.”: I can understand people
drinking metho., because it con-
sists of about 90 per cent, alcohol (ethyl),
but it is difficult to conceive even the
most hardened addict tackling petrol
and getting away with it (B. l/11/’33).
A small quantity of ordinary petrol, say
a couple of fluid ounces, is toxic, and
a good many cases of fatal intoxi-
cation are on record, the stuff having
been swallowed either by intending sui-
cides or inhaled accidentally. If a man
drank five or six ounces, and could keep
it down, I suspect it would be his last
drink on earth.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: Melbourne citizens gath-
ered together at a weekly prayer meeting
discussed an English bishop who asked,
“Is one act of misconduct comparable
with constant bad temper, cruelty, and
drunkenness in marriage? Why not for-
give it?” W. H. Edgar, M.L.C., was so
shocked at this that he called for prayers
for the bishop. The Rev. Penry Evans
weighed in with a sort of defence of
his brother of the cloth, but qualified
it by saying that “a husband is
able to forgive an unfaithful wife far
more easily than a wife can overlook her
husband’s infidelity. The act of miscon-
duct is the end of everything for a
woman —that is nature.” But is it? There
are nomad tribes in Asia whose men re-
gard it as the highest degree of hospi-
tality to lend their wives to strangers who
happen to share their roof. In Japan
it is customary for husbands to
indulge in concubines and casual unions,
and the wives find it quite natural to
.accede to this arrangement. I once knew
a Malay of 50 who took unto himself a
second wife, aged 14. When I asked him
what his first wife thought about it, he
told me that it was she who had sug-
gested it.

“Teacher”: The old model schools
now being dismantled in Melbourne are
more than 60 years old (B. 11/10/’33).
I have a teacher’s certificate belonging
to my mother when she was one of the
first infant mistresses there. It is dated
1857.
VIRGINIBUS PUERISQUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“N.S.W. Police Commissioner Childs condemns the
growing tendency of youth to parade the streets in
the scantiest of bathing costumes, and hints at the
possibility of official action.”
From the Church we’ve had homilies moving,
And Bumbles have risen in ire
To register views disapproving
Of ultra-exiguous attire
When, dry or aglow from the dipping
In surf and in sunshine of each,
Our Bert and his Gertie are tripping
Toward or away from the beach.
Some classed it as Puritan patter,
Some reckoned it wowserish slops;
But this is a different matter.
You youngsters conventions who shatter,
Look our for the cops!
You need have no fear of objectors
On the beach to free views of your frames,
For they’re human, these seaside inspectors,
And chivalrous censors of dames.
Each day, in the heights and the hollows .
Of the surf and the sands they must view
All-but unapparelled Apollos
And foam-risen Venuses, too.
But once you are clear of the water,
Have done with the ways of the wilds,
And remember, my son and my daughter,
Neglecting to dress as you oughter
Is worrying Childs.
Where billows and surf-sheds are handy
You needn’t anticipate thuds
Or frowns if you emulate Gandhi
In the niggardly cut of your duds.
But if you would tackle the Corso,
Or traverse our roadways and paves
With as much of your limbs and your torso
On view as you showed in the waves,
I warn you, I bid you, be wary
Of loitering ’front of the shops.
O lightly-clad Monty, and Mary,
Whose rig would be scant for a fairy,
Watch out for the cops!

T. THE R.


“Hory”: I was selling cars down
Gippsland way when I came on a tough
nut. He wanted a car, that was certain ;
he knew little about cars, that was clear ;
he had a very suspicious and grasping
nature, that was most obvious of all. I
worked him for pretty near a fortnight,
but couldn’t quite bring him to the mark.
Came the last day of my stay there. 1
talked to him all the morning. I bought
him beer before and after dinner. I
took him for a drive in the afternoon.
More beer. Tea with his family. A
friendly game of cards after, and then
beer. Still I couldn’t land him. At last
I said, in bitter humor, “Take the car and
I’ll throw in the clutch for you! ” “Man! ”
he shouted excitedly, rising to his feet,
“I’ll take it; but I wasn’t goin’ to buy
an expensive car like that with nothin’
free. Man, I been waitin’ fer ye ter
throw in somethin’ fer two weeks!”
* * * *
“Rokko”: The story of the small boy
who wasn’t naked because he had his
hat on recalls the experience of a sea-
faring friend of mine who used to sail
his own schooner about the Pacific. On
one trip he took his missus and eldest
daughter with him and, coming to a
small isle where the chief was an old-
time friend, he sent ashore a parcel
of clothing and the news that he had
ladies aboard. The parcel contained
sundry items regarded as suitable for the
potentate, who replied that he would call
formally that afternoon. He did, and
after one glance at his approaching guest
the captain hustled his womankind below-
stairs. A huge warrior clad merely in
“You always wanted to see the world — now’s your opportunity.”
an ancient belltopper boarded the ship.
His retinue, of both sexes, had shared
the rest of the clothes contribution, but
had little more on than the chief.
* * * *
“Pounce”: Yielding to the persuasions
of silver-tongued counsel a Sydney Judge
in Equity directed that an injunction re-
straining all branches of the Common-
wealth Bank from making payments out
of a certain account might be conveyed
“by letter, telegram or broadcast .” He
probably now wishes he hadn’t been quite
so modern-minded. A Judge of even 20
years ago would, in similar circum-
stances, probably have insisted on per-
sonal service in every instance. The prac-
tice in more recent years has been to
make personal service of the injunction
on the head office of the bank, which
has relayed the Court’s order to its
branches by code telegram. There is
plenty of room for slips in that pro-
cedure, from the legal point of view, but,
as bankers have been pointing out, with
considerable agitation, if it is once estab-
lished that Court orders may be sand-
wiched among the racing reports, tenor
solos, hosiery ads. and bedtime stories
that crowd the ether, the only safeguard
a bank can have against liability to dis-
obey the Court is to listen-in continually
to all stations.

“Murkah”: The decision to lay a tele-
phone cable across Bass Strait represents
the end of a year-long radio battle.
About twelve months ago it was decided
to bring Tasmania in on the world’s
radio-telephone switch. Naturally, no
trouble was anticipated ; but the distance
proved to be on a critical point—too
great for long waves, which produced
distortion at both ends, and too short
for short waves, which passed over about
12 miles up {i.e., they missed the island).
For similar reasons receivers at (say)
Lithgow get better results from 4QG
Brisbane or 3LO Melbourne than from
adjacent 2FC Sydney. A proposal to
work the service through Sydney was
negatived. Meanwhile we can “ring”
Moscow, London and Vladivostok ; but
we can’t even say good-day to Laun-
ceston or Hobart.
* * * *
“El V.”: The thing which has struck
me most about the outbursts of our
Ms.P. in the last week or two is their
lack of vocabulary. They used to do
better, as witness Shakspeare. When
Gloucester entered the Parliament of
Henry VI. “offering to put up a bill,”
Winchester, his enemy (“Henry V 1.,”
Part I), did not mince matters, and
Gloucester’s reply to him was one of
which any M.L.A. might be proud:
Such is thy audacious wickedness,
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks....
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
Froward, wanton....
Then Winchester shouted “Gloucester, I
defy thee!” and Gloucester called him
“bastard of my grandfather.” Honors
were about even when the King, as
Speaker, intervened.
* Hs * *
“P. 8.1.”: The noise made by high-
velocity bullets (B. 25/10/’33) depends
entirely on the distance from the weapon
fired. At short ranges there is a very
definite “crack”; as the range increases,
say, from 1000 to 1500 yards, the noise
dies down to a “zip,” and over 2000
yards it becomes almost a whisper. Hav-
ing been under machine-gun fire at
various ranges up to 3000 yards, I have
distinct and uncomfortable recollections.
The extremely unpleasant series of
“cracks” made by a burst of Ger-
man M.G. fire at a range of about
150 yards 16 years ago is still
an ever-present memory. “Jerrick” is
not quite correct with regard to velocity,
either. The service bullet travels at
2200 ft. per second at a range of 100
yards only; by the time it has gone
1000 yards the pace has slowed down
to 1000 ft. per second, and it is then
travelling slower than the sound of the
firing of the weapon.
“Cordite”: The sound made by the
modern bullet passing varies with the
distance you are away from the firer,
going through the various stages of
snap, “crack,” “ping,” “whine,”
“swish,” “buzz,” and finally, at very long
ranges, “wisp.” As the attack in
“Hamer’s” story took place under
cover of a barrage, it is reasonable to
assume that the forward guns were
swamped and that the bullets passing
were from the rear guns, which would
have to travel a considerable distance
before reaching the attacking troops. So
far as that goes, I consider “Hamer’s”
description reasonable.

“Chevroford”; Melbourne sassiety is
agitated over the question of whether
Gengoult Smith is to enter St. Paul’s
Cathedral on December 6 as Gaud
Mayor or as plain Gengoult Smith.
The occasion is his
marriage. If he de-
cides on being a mere
citizen the ceremony
will lack sartorial ele-
gance, but if he
marches up the aisle
in his civic capacity
he will have to wear
black silk stockings,
knee-breeches, white
ruffles, gown and
c h a i n —a spectacle

thousands. Moreover,

tary and aldermanic persons generally will
add to the effect by wearing their feathers.
No previous mayor married during his
incumbency, and the records of the
leading cities of the Empire have been
ransacked without revealing a similar
concatenation of events.

“Glucose”: “Calliungal” (B. 11/10/’33)
is wrong. Cairns was once condemned
by a pilot who got bogged in a salt pan
over which high tides rise, and who con-
sequently declared that there were no
aerodromes in N.Q. Had he only
taken the trouble to fly on to Atherton,
which he could have done in 15 minutes,
he would have found one of the best
’dromes in the Commonwealth. Kings-
ford Smith landed the Southern Cross on
it and said it was the best ground in
Queensland outside of Archerfield (Bris-
bane), and many other pilots have re-
ferred to it in glowing terms. The rain-
fall in Atherton averages 51 inches a
year, but the ’drome remains unaffected,
all because of its smooth, level surface
and its natural drainage.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Christchurch claims to
have “the best electric tramway service
in Australasia,” does it (B. 18/10/’33)?
We rather thought in Adelaide that we
had. Certainly we have had for many
years all the types of corridor car which
“Leather Cuff’s” par. finds worth en-
thusiasm.

“W.P.T.”: The first statue of Captain
Cook erected in Australia is situated in
a tiny triangular plot at Randwick,
though it is hard to see what the great
navigator had to do with the racing
suburb. The statue, erected by Thomas
Watson, was unveiled in 1874 by Com-
modore Goodenough, who was killed a
year later in an endeavor to open up
friendly relations with the natives at
Santa Cruz. The statue is well cared for,
but is in such a position (near a butcher’s
shop) that few people even know of its
existence. It only needs a Melbourne
man to offer to buy it and remove it to
Yarra’s side for local bodies to wake up
to its historic importance. It might even
be shifted to Kurnell.
* * * *
“Erua”: Reference to the “brazen
voice and blistering vocabulary” of the
drill corporal recalls the war-time ex-
perience at Trentham Camp of a young
M.L. lance-corporal. The drill sergeant
was suffering from an attack of sore
throat, and feeling unable to do himself
justice appointed the lance-corporal to
hand his orders on to the troops. The
sergeant was famous for his flow of pro-
fanity ; the lance-corporal was a divinity
student. The first order was delivered
with suitable invective ; in the second and
third the sergeant surpassed himself. This
was because the student, with amazing
quickness, had translated the raw material
into language so polite that the listeners
scarcely recognised them for orders, The
sergeant, purple with wrath, continued to
croak out awful words, and the offsider
continued to interpret in accordance with
his profession. At last the gave
it up. “Just say ‘Dismiss, my loves,’ ” he
croaked, “and kiss yer hand to them as
they go.”
“Skeeta G.”: 1
was walking with a
medico along Mac-
quarie-street, Syd-
ney, when a seedy
individual retrieved
from the gutter a
decent-sized cigar-
e t t e-b u t t and
promptly placed it
between his lips. “A
source of infection?”
I queried. “Abso-
lutely no,” pro-
nounced Galen;
“germs won’t live in sunlight and open
air. Visitors to the large cities of China,”
he went on, “look upon the native habit
of spitting in the streetways as disgust-
ing and unhealthy. The Chinaman main-
tains that his custom is hygienic, and
that the European system of handker-
chiefs merely harbors germs. I share
the Chinaman’s view.”
* * * *
“Pat McGinty”: Anyone who suggests
that the song “It’s a Long Way to Tip-
perary” has nothing to do with Ireland
(B. 25/10/’33) can know nothing of
the song but the chorus. I first
heard it played on a gramophone
about 1913. It started; “Up to
mighty London came an Irishman
one day.” Eventually, one gathered, the
visitor got so fed up with the capital,
the streets of which he had expected to
find paved with gold, that he shouted
to all and sundry “It’s a long way,” etc.
The mere words “and my heart’s right
there” ought to have enlightened even
a Scotsman. No one ever left his heart
in Oldbury, Birmingham.
* * * *
‘ Oxmead”: After reading Mackaness’s
“Life of Bligh” I have arrived at the
conclusion that, for all his meticulous
weighing of the evidence, he makes out a
poor case for his contention thalt
the deposed Governor funked it at the
last and was dragged from his hiding-
place under a bed. A score of lesser
biographers and commentators have
treated the Admiral more justly than this.
His courage, for all his mulish perversity,
was never questioned, except on this occa-
sion. A man who meditates hiding from
an infuriated mob doesn’t begin by put-
ting on his uniform and his medals.
Bligh himself evidently thought the ac-
cusation so preposterous that he hardly
troubled to notice it at the legal proceed-
ings in England, except by pointing
out the construction that fair-minded
men would have put on his attempt to
delay capture, viz., that he was engaged
in concealing papers that were essential
if he were to justify himself. Finally,
on what authority did the charge of
cowardice rest? The say-so of a few
excited soldiers, who knew that the
vilest and most malignant lie they could
invent about an intensely hated Gover-
nor would be readily credited. They
weren’t even original; the “hiding-under-
a-bed” calumny is a very old and hardy
annual. And how vehemently it con-
flicts with everything we know of the
man on the sort of testimony that is
beyond questioning!
NO GOOD, MISTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All is not gold that glisters,
So Shakspeare tells us true.
And brethren, also sisters,
That goes for silver, too.
Whenever change you’re handed
Quick scrutiny’s demanded,
Or like as not you’re landed
With coins you soon may rue;
Best give the spacious florin
More than a hasty squint
In search of something foreign
About the ring or print;
And let keen optics wimble
Into the shilling nimble
Lest it should prove a symbol
That never saw the Mint.
Bend on the sprat or tanner
A. penetrating gaze;
In most alluring manner
They fake ’em nowadays.
And sore the need of mentors
To guard us from inventors
When dark suspicion centres
On even humble treys.
All is not gold that glitters,
But still you get a thud,
There’s something that embitters
And makes you feel like mud,
When traminies hand the token
You’ve tendered back, unbroken,
With that faint scorn, unspoken,
That warrants it a dud.

Like Lyons, Scullin denies that he
was a party to any midnight meeting
of members to arrange the salary grab.
The proposal, he asserts, was “mooted
in this Chamber at 9.30 a.m.” (Gabb says
that it was “mooted” “a fortnight be-
fore,” and that he was twice approached
to see if he would keep his mouth shut)
“and disposed of at 12.30 p.m. in broad
daylight.” Let Scullin have it his own
way. It was political daylight robbery
then.
The House of Reps, began with 75
members, and acquired another after the
war, when the Northern Territory was
given an M.H.R. without a vote. The
number of voting members is to be re-
duced for the first time to 74 ; as a result
of the census, South Aus. will have six
men in the next House instead of seven.
With 580,900 people, it will send only
one more M.H.R. to Canberra than West-
ralia, with 438,900, and Tasmania, with
227,600 ; which is rough on South Aus.
When T. G. Murray was sure of elec-
tion to the “reformed” N.S.W. Leg.
Council “S. M. Herald” innocently men-
tioned that the gentleman “has been an
active figure in the political arena with
the various parties with which he has
been connected.... and at the present
time is an active member of the U.A.P.”
It might have added that Bligh-street
has a great deal more time for politicians
who have been “connected with various
parties” than for faithful souls like
Henley, who couldn’t twist if they tried ;
but then Granny always tries to be a lady.
Eminent Englishmen are being sounded
as to their willingness to take on the job
of Vic. Governor during the centenary
year, and put up the royal visitor if one
is forthcoming. Competition is not keen ;
the salary is only £4OOO, and out-of-
pocket expenses for that year at least
will be tremendous. So Victoria may
have to fall back on Lieut.-Gov. Irvine
and make him a special grant.
It is not known for certain whether
fruit-machines will be installed in the
new Leg. Council, but presumably Traut-
wein, who will adorn the Chamber, will be
able to supply them if required. Traut-
wein’s association with the fruit-machine
industry exercised Justice Halse Rogers’s
mind a great deal. He was a Labor man
of sorts during the last Lang period, and,
Mr. Halse Rogers “came to the conclu-
sion”:—
That he did enter into a scheme to attempt
to obtain immunity for hotelkeepers, who used
these machines.... ; that he received for the pur-
pose of that scheme £3OOO, and that he did
take steps to procure the desired immunity.
What he did with the money cannot be said.
Perhaps he is keeping it to endow a home
for lost politicians.
Fairbairn has made an excellent im-
pression on the electors of Flinders,
except at the Wonthaggi end (a combina-
tion of Gladstone, Disraeli, Parkes and
Deakin would fail to impress Wonthaggi),
and looks like succeeding Bruce, though
Dr. Haywood, the Labor man, is no mean
antagonist. But Lyons and Parkhill must
regard the young man’s candidature with
conflicting emotions. He denounces the
salary grab.
If Harry Bailey can get enough primary
votes to put him into the second count
he should win the Warrnambool by-elec-
tion on preferences, but his difficulty will
be to get enough. Bailey is standing as
an Independent; if returned, he intends
to support Hogan, his old chief. The
A.L.P. expelled Bailey because he had
stood by Hogan and the Premiers’ plan.
Last year he did a Canossa pilgrimage to
give Labor a chance of taking him back,
but it left him in the snow.
It seems as if, after all, the soldiers, sea-
men and airmen who were forgotten when
politicians and civil servants —including
civilians in the Defence Department —
were having their salaries raised are to
get increases on the normal public-service
scale. As they lost about £450,000
through the financial-emergency legisla-
tion, it is no more than a fair thing. No
sergeant-major can be a good non-com.
on less than the basic wage, though
starvation may be reckoned a stimulant
to the flow of profanity for which
n.c.os. are unjustly famous.
Queensland railwaymen’s unions held
up Forgan Smith with a demand for
amendment of the State Arbitration Act,
section 82, which says that the Court
may not interfere with or prejudice the
operation of the Financial Emergency
Act. Deletion would mean that the way
would lie open to increases in wages and
other privileges and shortening of hours.
Forgan replied that money is too tight
to take a chance like that this year ; and
the “comrades” are very stuffy about it.
The secretary of the Queensland police-
men’s union has been making unpleasant

“Send for the razor-gang squad! Get the wireless patrol and Black Maria!

remarks concerning political meddling
in the interests of gamblers. Moore
rose at the chance like a hungry trout,
and, if he can manage it, secretary Talty
will be heard at the Bar of the House.
Part of the income of the Canberra
pubs is provided by visitors who sport
horn-rimmed glasses, smoke chain cigars
and talk through their noses. They
arrive in a swarm whenever the interests
of “the great motion-picture industry”
are affected, or it is thought they are, and
hang round Parliament House till the
oracle has spoken. They were on hand
when the Senate requested a reduction of
the duty on foreign feature films from
Is. a foot to 4d., and again when the
matter came up in the House of Reps.
With a few well-chosen remarks about
the methods of “the great motion-picture
industry,” White, the Customs Minister,
moved that the duty should be Bd. a
foot; and so it was decided. Then the
horde of strangers wiped their horn-
rimmed spectacles, bit the ends off a
fresh lot of cigars, guessed and calcu-
lated bitterly through their noses, and
departed.
Forde, the Labor member for Capri-
cornia, has hitherto been regarded as one
of those enthusiasts who would support
a protective duty on ice if it were pro-
posed to export it to the South Pole ;
but he weakened when the duty on
feature films was dealt with. The Senate
wanted it fixed at 4d. a foot; “the anti-
Australian” Government, as he calls it,
asked for Bd.; Forde lamely suggested
that 6d. would be “a fair compromise.”
In 1929, of course, the film interest helped
to put Forde’s crowd in.
Clapp, of the Vic. railways, must spend
a lot more time at the telephone than
any other subscriber. His Government,
which pays £l7OO p.a. in officials’ ’phone
bills, had to find £94 10s. Id. to settle his
house account last year. In terms of
local calls, this means that Clapp spent
2 hours 6 minutes per day at the ’phone
throughout the year, including Sundays
and holidays. Of course, there must have
been many trunk-line calls; but, even
so, £94 10s. seems unconscionable. The
Police Commissioner’s ’phone cost the
State £l3 2s. sd.
Vic. Labor Assemblymen fought to
the last ditch against the Gas Regulation
Bill. It moved amendment after amend-
ment on the third reading (it is per-
missible in this House to keep on bar-
neying until the final motion for trans-
mission of a bill to the Uppish House
is passed); but the Cockies rallied to the
Government. As member for Caul-
field Harold Luxton is not disliked by
the Labor Opposition, but in the guise of
vice-chairman of the Met. Gas Co. he
raises the ire of the Left. The bill will
have an easier passage in the Leg.
Council.
While whining that it is desperately
hard up, Westralian Labor is making a
welter of the spoils-to-the-victors prin-
ciple—the 44-hour week for all Govern-
ment employees, restoration of the finan-
cial-emergency cuts (promised anyhow),
jobs for defeated Labor candidates and, if
the Leg. Council agrees, conversion of the
lottery Mitchell permitted into a 100
per cent. State affair. That will mean
more jobs no doubt. Meanwhile the un-
employed-relief tax has been doubled and
now the entertainments tax goes up.
When the Constitution-makers were at
work the Westralians and Tasmanians
stuck out for a minimum representation
of five members in the Lower House,
together with six in the Senate ; and they
had their way. In the case of South Aus.
it was provided that the State should have
seven original members (six if Westralia
remained out), but not that this should
be the irreducible minimum. Nor was
anything put in the Constitution to the
effect that there must be at least 75 vot-
ing representatives. So, numbers being
against it, South Australia is to lose one-
seventh of the representation it has had
since 1901. And there is no way of
restoring the lost member save by amend-
ment of the Constitution, which can only
be amended by the referendum route.
Whatever the ultimate result of the
N.S.W. Leg. Council election, the pri-
mary vote can never be forgotten. At
the hands of all the State’s legislators the
Dean of the Faculty of Law at Sydney
Uni. could secure only four more pri-
mary votes than Mr. Trautwein and Mr.
Alam. More members showed an abso-
lute preference for a quick-change poli-
tician like Mr. Murray than for any of
Stevens’s Council Ministers or for the 49
other candidates who received primary
votes, including the chairman of the
U.A.P. and C.P. organisations and men
of the calibre of F. H. Tout, Norman
Kater and W. C. Cambridge.
Q. Attorney-General Mullan is going to
consult the Supreme Court Justices as to
the abolition of special juries in civil
cases. Under the Jury Act a majority
of their Honors must agree to the
change. Mullan contended in Parliament
that if undesirables were kept off the
common-jury list the shift would make
no difference. He has perhaps forgotten
a police report on the common-jury list
during the life of the McCormack
Government, of which he was a Minister;
it was full of blistering comment
on the class of people who had got
on the tally. One of the Copley brothers,
the Kurilpa young man, argued that
the special-jury system had the disadvan-
tage of possible prejudice in favor of
business men involved in litigation with
other sections. It was not in evidence
when a special jury found for Theodore,
McCormack and co. in the Mungana
case.
“Hansard” amplifies newspaper re-
ports of Scullin’s assertion that “an
attack was made by The Bulletin upon
a representative of his Majesty the King,
the State Governor of New South
Wales”:
That journal published a full-page cartoon
representing the Governor as Judas. I pro-
tested, but I did not press for action, and I
regret that I omitted to do so.
There was no Judas cartoon ; and it is
just as well for the little gentleman that
he didn’t take “action.” The spectacle of
Scullin posing as a perfervid champion
of a gentleman from Downing-street—
Scullin, whose newspaper printed those
things about the Prince of Wales, who
published that pamphlet on the policy
of the King’s Ministers in Ireland, and
who was so thick with De Valera during
his travels abroad as Prime Minister—
would have been too ridiculous altogether.

Dr. L. B. Bull, who leaves for two
years’ experience in Europe and Africa
in animal-health research, is a graduate
of Melbourne. He put in his first years
studying native fauna, but has spent the
last twenty as expert in bacteriology at
Adelaide Hospital and University.
About the last man in S. Aus. who
remembered Queen Victoria’s accession is
dead at Wandearah (S.. Aus.) —John Van-
stone, 105. He was a grown man on
landing at Port Adelaide in 1847, and
was in the first Vic. goldrush, doing well
there at Forest Creek, but having no luck
later at Gympie (Q.). Then he founded
a farming family in S. Aus.
An attempted come-back by the ex-
plorer Larry Wells has nearly ended in
tragedy. Defying his years, he went out
prospecting for gold in the far north of
S. Aus., and in six weeks’ time was found
80 miles out from Tarcoola, suffering
badly from thirst and heat. He is mak-
ing a good recovery. You can’t kill some
of these oldsters.
Edward August Langsworth, dead at 69,
was one of the first two switch attendants
appointed at Sydney Post Office when
the telephone was new. He saw the tele-
phonic network through its initial stages,
and his hard work brought him quick
promotion. He rose to the position of
assistant manager. Since his retirement
some years ago his hobby has been toy-
making. All the toys were sold for
Marrickville Cottage Hospital, and
usually realised £5OO a year. Only
recently he supplied the material and
renovated a building at Penshurst for
use as an Anglican church.
Nobody could say that Evan Kyffin
Thomas does not lead a busy life.
Though he is a third-generation Aus-
tralian —grandpa founded the Adelaide
“Register”—he still possesses some of the
fire which tells that his family’s home-
town was Rhandregwnwen, which is
much easier to say than it looks. He
was born a Croweater in 1866, joined the
EVAN KYFFIN THOMAS, of Adelaide.
“Register” literary staff in 1885, and
served 14 years’ apprenticeship before
he became a proprietor. As chairman of
the Adelaide committee of the Empire
Press Union in 1925 and as deputy
chairman of the Australian delegation to
the 1930 conference he was a great suc-
cess. He has held office in half the
public bodies in Adelaide.
H. F. Chappell, Shire Clerk of the
Warroo (Q.) Shire Council and secretary
of the local Returned Soldiers’ Club, is
dead. He was a journalist in Traralgon
(Vic.) before the war. Then he migrated
to Queensland to take up land near Mun-
dubbera, went to the front and had two
years in hospital to get over his wounds,
returned to the North and held secre-
tarial positions in Gayndah and Mun-
dubbera before going to Surat. A good
chap with a host of friends.
Douglas Dundas, the young Australian
painter who had a show at the Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney, recently, was born
at Inverell (N.S.W.) and first in-
tended going on the land. When
he discovered that he could handle a
palette as well as a plough, he left fo : r
DOUGLAS DUNDAS, a rising Aus-
tralian artist.
Sydney to join Julian Ashton’s school. In
1927, after five years’ hard work under
Ashton, he won the Society of Artists’
travelling scholarship and studied on the
Continent for two years. He is now a
teacher of art at East Sydney Tech.
Queensland’s Rhodes scholar next year
will be J. C. Richards, son of the Profes-
sor of Geology. He is an engineering
student at dad’s University, and his forte
is the study of structural steels. Three
former Rhodes scholars—A. S. Roe,
Stanley Castlehow and Neil Macrossan —
helped to select him.
Tas. University gets a very youth-
ful professor in the 23-year-old
Kenneth Shatwell who has been chosen
to fill the Law chair. He is a law lec-
turer at Hull University College, with a
first-class honors degree in Arts from
Oxford, where his subject was juris-
prudence. For two terms he was tutor
in law at Lincoln College, Oxford.
Two hardy twins, John and Thomas
Mahony, who celebrated their 87th birth-
days in Melbourne last week, were so
much alike in their very early youth that
they got mixed up after their christening
and nobody has been sure since which is
which. John, who helped to build old
Prince’s Bridge, looks slightly the older,
but he cannot be blamed for that, seeing
that he has 12 children, 46 grandchildren
and 36 great-grandchildren.
David Holloway, 98 when he died at
Hill End, was probably the last “last
survivor in Australia” of the Crimean
war, after which he and a comrade
named Casey sought further adventure in
the navy. They deserted from the H.M.S.
Juno when she was in Sydney to go to
the goldfields, hiding in the bush at
Maroubra till she had'gone. Holloway
went to Ophir, where he stayed put; and
Casey to Victoria. The pair did not meet
again for 40 years, when the latter, tired
of Victoria, came over to see his old
friend.
Two employees, J. J. Goodman and
W. E. Walsh, both linotype men, have
celebrated their jubilee with the Laun-
ceston “Examiner.” Goodman joined
in ’B3 ; Walsh in 1879. They still
have some way to go to beat the office
record, which was held by the late W. T.
Feutrill, who joined the staff in 1855 and
worked on it until the last year of the
Great War.
Roy M. Bell, selected by the Queens-
land Country-Progs, as their candidate
for the Stanley by-election next month,
is a grazier at Eskdale, but was born
at Pickering (N.S.W.), 48 years ago, a
scion of an old pioneer family who own
some splendid Shorthorns. Educated at
The King’s School, Sydney, he bought the
Eskdale property in 1915, and has since
been closely identified with the progress
of the district. He is a worthy inter-
state polo player.
Australia will hear more of Jeune
Scott-Kemball, a self-possessed S. Aus.
girl, who at 18 is holding, at the Argo-
naut gallery in Adelaide, her second ex-
hibition of paintings, mainly on wood.
Experiment is her forte. Her only per-
sonal travel, to Java, is heavily drawn
upon for weird ornament, but she also
elaborates on Greek lines and Cretan, on
Mexican and Yucatan —she makes clear
distinction in each case.
T. Crisp Poole, who drew his last
pleadings in Brisbane the other day,
was for many years one of the best-
known characters in the Queensland
legal profession. He was for some time in
the office of a Brisbane firm of solicitors
picking up the ropes —he was an English-
man. Given a writ to serve in Gympie,
106 miles away, he walked the distance
there and back in order to save the
travelling costs for himself. Back in
Brisbane it was found that he had served
the copy and kept the writ. Once
more he walked to Gympie, fixed the
matter up, and walked back again. He
suffered all his life from two diseases
which are fatal to success in the law—
an inferiority complex and a contempt
for money.
The benevolent cleric here pictured is
Robert Brodribb Hammond, of Ham-
mond’s Hotels, strange havens in the
parish of St. Barnabas, Sydney, where
every unemployed man who can be
packed in becomes the guest of the
Canon and his supporters. Hammond
also founded Hammondville, where
evicted victims of the depression are
settled on an acre of land and given a
fresh start. The only thing which the
inmates of his hostels don’t get is a
drink —mine host has been president of
Canon R. B. HAMMOND, founder of
Hammond’s Hotels.
the Australian Prohibition Alliance since
1918, and represented Australia at the
World Conference on Alcoholism held
in Washington (D.C.) in 1919. He shares
a distinction with S. M. Bruce —they both
are old-time captains of Melbourne
Grammar School.
Arthur Pickels is a fine advertisement
for himself. Little and delicate, he is
one of Australia’s greatest dairymen. He
went to Wondai (Q.) many years ago
to found an Illawarra stud. He soon
became expert in developing the blood
lines of the then-unstable race of reds
and roans, and in a few years no show-
ring was complete without a few Florries
of Blacklands tied to the rails and the
pale, diminutive figure of their owner
hanging ribbons in a stall. The years
ARTHUR PICKELS, of Illawarra cattle
fame.
have been good to him. He has grown
physically stronger than in his early days,
and, while everybody who knows the
stud business acknowledges the debt
which Australian dairying owes to his
skill, he has raised as well a younger
generation of the Pickels family who
promise to be as good herdmasters as
their father.
George Douglas Bassett, of Forbes and
Dubbo, who at the election of N.S.W.
Ms.L.C. achieved the long-distance
record by taking 98 minutes to mark
his paper, specialises in wool and wheat.
He recently became a worshipper of
Strawberry. While his home station is
at Forbes, he has established a show
place, Cumboogle, on the banks of the
Macquarie, six miles out of Dubbo.
Bassett was one of the last group
appointed to the nominee Upper House.
R.C. Archbishop Philip Bernardini, the
new Apostolic Delegate, is only 49. He
received the Doctor of Laws degree and
was ordained in Rome in 1911. Later
he served as secretary to the Commis-
sion for the Codification of Canon Law,
and in 1914 went to Washington for sub-
sequent appointment as Professor of
Canon Law at the Catholic University.
He was legal adviser to the delegate of
that city, and was made Private Cham-
berlain by Pope Benedict in 1917 and
Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius in 1929.
Recently Australia’s old friend the
Sultan of Johore celebrated his 60th
birthday—a great age for a Malayan.
In his hectic youth the potentate worried
his British advisers. Horseracing was a
passion with him, and it was feared he
would gamble his revenues away. His
jungly State lived mainly on the proceeds
of the opium and gambling farms, his
capital being a sort of Monte Carlo for
the white youth of the neighboring island
of Singapore. In later life he settled
down and became a shining example to
his brother-rulers of the Peninsula. Dur-
ing his reign the population of the State
rose from 100,000 to half a million, and
even during the slump enjoyed a revenue
of 10,000,000 dollars. Last year he mar-
ried an Englishwoman who embraced the
Moslem faith and has made a remark-
ably fine fist of the Sultana job.

This is the holding co. through which J.
C. Hutton and Foggitt Jones, the enter-
prising ham and bacon people, welded
their interests in 1927. At Sept. 30 last
its £1,400,000 of capital (£450,000 of it
carries a cumulative 8 p.c.), together with
a handful of reserves, was all represented
by shares in the two operating cos.,
£1,355,000 (cost), and £56,996 of ad-
vances, etc. The price pqid for the scrip
in the two subsidiaries included £638,308
for reserves, of which £463,000 was dis-
closed by a revaluation of the assets.
No goodwill figured in the deal.
At the start it looked like an 8 p.c.
proposition, with possibilities—the aver-
age net earnings of the pair for the three
years before the merger was £131,043
p.a. But slump and competition, especi-
ally the latter, have so completely
changed the outlook that the prefs. were
short-paid 7.2 d. per share in respect of
the last term, while the ords. have had
to go without for the last three years.
Over the four years to the close of
accounts in 1932, turnover of the two
operating cos. combined slipped 33.4 p.c.,
while gross earnings fell away by 49.7
p.c. During the last term the cos.’ con-
nections appear to have expanded, but
competition kept the price of pigs up and
forced the price of bacon down. There
was thus a further slip of £38,117 in
the aggregate gross earnings of the pair:

the net result at 3 p.c. on the combined
capitals (£716,700) as against 4, 3.4, 15.7,
16.5 and 19.2 p.c. for the five preceding
years. To enable the United Co. to pay
its own pref. div. and 3 p.c. on its ord.
capital, the operating cos. need to pay
9 p.c. on their combined capitals, or less
than half the amount netted in 1928.
But until those in the trade decide to bury
the hatchet, it is difficult to say to what
extent, if any, earnings can be expected
to benefit, despite improvement in the
outlook generally.
Balance-sheet movements suggest that
trade was livelier:

The £1,152,618 of capital (it includes
£228,500 carrying a cumulative 8 p.c.,
with the right to advance with the ords.
to 10 p.c.), so-called reserves and £22,440
coming to creditors at Sept. 30 were all
represented by shares in Australian Paper
Manufacturers, in at £1,241,889, and
£105,447 of deposits, etc. The manufac-
turing co. took over the assets of A. P.
and P. and Cumberland Board Mills
(Sydney) for scrip in 1926. After destruc-
tion by fire of the Sydney mills in 1929,
it put up new but smaller and more effi-
cient plant at Botany, and clipped 4s. per
share (£320,000) off capital, reducing the
figure to £1,280,000, of which A. P. and
P. owns £993,511. No adjustment has been
made in the holding co.’s books in this
connection.
During the last term A. P. and P.
showed 8.7 p.c. on its capital as against
8 p.c. for the previous term, and the all-
round 8 p.c. div. was repeated, again free
of the special 10 p.c. tax on income from
property. On the market the prefs. fetch
345. and the ords. 325. 6d. as against
30s. 3d. and 295. respectively a year ago.
The return at the higher figures is 4.7 p.c.
and 4.9 p.c. respectively on an 8 p.c. dis-
tribution. On the basis of last year’s p.
and 1. figures, the cut in the special tax
on income from property and in the
ordinary rate on co. incomes means an
annual saving of over £7600 (= 0.6 p.c.
on capital) to the co.

Exchange and the tariff brought this
co.’s way much business formerly placed
overseas, keeping the mills well em-
ployed, to the benefit of costs. Hence
the spring in earnings, notwithstanding
further reductions in selling prices. Last
year’s net result (up £12,071) was
written after setting aside £50,000 for the
taxgatherer, £5OOO for bad and doubtful
debts, and adding £65,306 net to the
depreciation reserve (£385,182). The div.
was not disclosed ; appearances are that
it was 11 p.c. or thereabouts. The board
anticipates an equally satisfactory result
for the current term.
During the year additions were made
to plant (£49,998 more was spent on
fixed assets than was written off), and
the financial position improved:

stronger than at the previotis balance. If
the co. decides to manufacture its own
pulp, instead of importing it, there is a
possibility that shareholders might be
asked for a bit more.

Stocks, taken into account at £21,561
below the 1932 figure, appear to have
been responsible for the worst of the
year’s troubles. The business is said to
have held fairly well. But the best de-
mand was for the less expensive lines,
and recent imports from Japan have
forced many retailers to revise the book
value of their silk and cotton stocks, etc.
The year’s gross earnings (£107,738) fell
away £17,432 ; exes. (£120,135) were only
£1603 lighter, leaving the balance £12,397
on the wrong side. That and an interim
div. on the 50,000 7 p.c. prefs. swallowed
the visible reserves, and left £1261 of the
ord. capital unrepresented by tangibles
in the books at July 26. The only allow-
ance for depreciation was in respect of
leaseholds. The ords., which averaged
7.1 p.c. with little to spare for the half-
dozen years to the close of accounts in
1930, have gone hungry for the last three
years.
However, the outlook generally has
improved, and there have been changes
on the board and in other respects, in-
cluding remissions in sales and income
taxes and tariff adjustments. The market
therefore prices the fully-paid pound
ords. at 12s. 9d. as against 9s. a year ago.
The return at 12s. 9d. would be 4.7 p.c.
on a 3 p.c. div. basis. At next balance
the pref. requirements and 3 p.c. to the
ords. would call for £15,682. The net
tangible cover is £6 Bs. Id. prefs. (they
seldom come on to the market) and
19s. lid. ords.
The financial position slipped, of
course:

Including stocks, the more or less liquid

at the previous balance. The co. has
not lacked enterprise. Since 1925 it has
bought the businesses of the Civil Service
Stores and Margaret Halstein, absorbed
Chapman’s, a neighbor, connected the
Adelaide- and Queen-street premises by
a subway, and extended and improved

sented no more than 54.4 p.c. of the

With the exception of 1930, when no-
body knew what was going to happen
next, and the board withheld a distri-
bution, the ord. div. hasn’t got below
5 p.c., notwithstanding that part of the
boom-time stocks represented jewellery
and other luxury lines. Stock-values
were worked down from £100,219 in
1927 to £60,177 last year, with little
worry to shareholders.
Optical goods, the line upon which the
business grew up, has been the principal
standby. The co.’s activities extend
all over the Commonwealth, while
a pup looks after the Maoriland
interests. The Queensland trade is also
in the hands of a separate subsidiary co.
Exactly how these concerns are pro-
gressing is not clear from the pub-
lished accounts, but their figures appear
to be expanding. Shares, debentures and
loans are practically unchanged at
£29,272; current accounts with sub-
sidiaries (£31,881) moved up £11,640
last year.
The year’s profit, written in one figure
at £7870 (after providing for bad debts
and depreciation), was £63 lighter than
that for 1932 ; after handing the prefs.
their requirements (less statutory cut) and
5 p.c. to the ords., £155 of the year’s
earnings remained in the business. After
allocating £2OOO to contingencies and
exchange fluctuation account, free
reserves figured at £15,195.

The reduction in stocks, debtors and
investments during 1932 enabled the
board to discharge £41,548 of debt.
When the latest accounts closed the sur-
plus of stocks, trade debtors and cash
exceeded outside liabilities by £42,308.
That excludes miscellaneous invest-
ments (which seem to include some
listed stocks) and advances to sub-
sidiaries. Freeholds, which consist of pro-
perties in Sydney and Melbourne, seem
to be in at a conservative figure. No
contingent liabilities in respect of the
subsidiary cos. appear in the sheet.
The ords., backed by 225. 7d. in net
tangibles (book value), are priced at 17s.
The return at that figure is 6 p.c. on a
5 p.c. div. basis. This scrip may be
worth holding. The reduction in prim-
age should help profits. The prefs. are
not active.

This co. does a large wholesale trade in
motor accessories, bicycles and radios;
moreover, it manufactures most of its
own requirements. Following net earn-
ings averaging 9.3 p.c. on ord. capital
for the four years to June 30, 1930, a
loss of £23,902 showed up in 1931.
The board, however, has grappled
successfully with its problems. A cut of
ss. per share (£53,035) was made in the
ords., reducing paid capital to £233,905
in 72,200 £1 prefs. and 137,860 ords. of
15s. each. That wiped out the p. and 1.
debit, together with £27,500 of the good-
will item (now £16,000), not treated as an
asset herein. An overhaul of the organi-
sation stopped up some of the old out-
lets, the Sydney business was put on an
even keel, and headway was made on the
manufacturing side, especially in radio
receivers, which had been placed on the
prohibited list of imports ; and the boom
in push : bikes, the line on which the busi-
ness was founded nearly 40 years ago,
helped, too.
During the last term there was a fur-
ther improvement of £2566 in net earn-
ings, which were sufficient to pay the
pref. div. and show 2.6 p.c. on ord.
capital. So the ords., held mainly by
family interests and those in the business,

“Old Warden”: Many Australians
were hit badly in the Mt. Lawson and
other Papuan mining fiascos. Now comes
news of other more or less valuable dis-
coveries on the Papuan mainland, this
time at the south-eastern extremity of the
big island. The new Eldorado is said to
lie between Milne Bay and Mullins Har-
bor, two inlets on the opposite sides of
the peninsula and about 30 miles apart.
Several syndicates and cos. have been
rooting in this comparatively small area,
but so far they have got little out of it
but material for prospectuses. Glowing
accounts of a valley full of golden
nuggets and platinum lumps as big as
grains of maize have been broadcast.
Actually, small platinum patches, too
low in value to reward the cheap labor
of box-sluicing, have been found. Two
cos. on the old Gibara field, at Milne
Bay, report that they have located large
ore-bodies, but the value of these re-
mains to be proved. The country was
turned over by capable prospectors 40
years ago, when the Milne Bay field was
a payable proposition. Desultory pros-
pecting inland from both sides of the
peninsula has since been carried out, but
without conspicuous success.
H®
A new find is reported about 60 miles
south of the Batavia River, Cape York
Peninsula. Upwards of 40 men are on
the new field, which has been named the
East Portland, and some promising reefs
have been struck. Rowe and Johnson
are developing a 4ft.-wide lode, and the
first 20 tons, expected to average 30z.,
has been sent to the Towers. The field,
which is claimed to be better than
Batavia, shows no signs of alluvial; it
is reached from Coen or Port Stewart by
motor-lorry.
* * * *
Exemption has been granted on the
leases held to work the big Inglewood
reef, Gympie (Q.); it is the low-grade
proposition of the field. Time has been
allowed to complete financial arrange-
ments for plant, equipment, etc., on the
Sovereign side of the Inglewood. Large
areas have been taken up on a hitherto
barren strip, with a view of testing the
theory of the Govt. Geologist that the
rich Monkland slates lie buried there.
Recent geological investigation suggested
that they were missed in previous pros-
pecting work through cross-coursing.
Everything points to another burst in
lode mining at Gympie. Also a further
attempt is to be made to work the exten-
sive alluvials along the Mary River.
Preliminary boring has begun, and sys-
tematic sampling, followed by flotation,
if results are satisfactory, can be
expected.
The rise in the price of tin has been a
tremendous relief to the Oakey Creek
Co., Mt. Garnet (N.Q.), which was work-
ing low-grade ores all through the de-
pression, the average being about \\ p.c.
metallic tin. Of its mines, the Excellent
is the main producer at present, its Sep-
tember figures being 130 tons, averaging
2 p.c. oxide. The Excelsior, from which
some 6000 tons of low-grade stuff has
been opencut, is now being developed
by a new shaft, the tin having followed
a master-joint, pitching at a low angle
to the north. The shaft is down 75ft.,
but in low-grade formation ; the ore-
body is not expected for another 10ft.
The co. has one of the best tin-saving
plants in North Queensland. But for
this, and corresponding low treatment
costs, it is doubtful whether the co. could
have made a commercial proposition of
these low-grade ores.
* * * *
Mt. Garnet must now be running
Herberton very close for the position of
premier tin-mining district in North
Queensland. In addition to two solid
producers in the Gilmore and Oakey
Creek lode mines, Nettle’s Creek dredg-
ing plant has so far recovered 30 tons of
oxide this year. Last year the district
produced approximately 200 tons of
oxide, including 70 tons from the Return
Creek dredge.
* * * *
North Queensland Development Co.
has taken over the old Hawkins Hill
goldmine near Durham, in the George-
town district, and dewatering has com-
menced. The show, worked only to
106 ft., yielded some rich stone in the.
early days. Cliff Rutledge, lately man-
ager of Chillagoe Smelters, is supervising
operations. The old Electric Light, a
large low-grade proposition about 10
miles from Georgetown, is also to receive
attention.
* * * *
At the New Caledonian, on the Max-
welton field, Gladstone (Q.), a three-head
battery has been erected ; recent crush-
ings averaged loz., and richer stone is
being taken out. The shaft is down 130 ft.
on the underlie, the reef averaging 7in.
in width. A number of other claims in
the vicinity is being worked, with more
or less promising results. The field was
discovered in the early ’nineties, and the
first 20 tons crushed yielded 198 oz. of
gold ; up till the end of 1904, when the
place was abandoned, crushings averaged
about l|oz.
* * * *
R. Blanchard, chief geologist at Isa
(N.Q.), has been inspecting numerous
propositions on the old Hodgkinson gold-
field (N.Q.) on behalf of Empire United
Gold Mines, Ltd., an English concern.
He recommended adoption of a less
ambitious scheme than was proposed.
For a start work is to be confined to
the old Tyrconnel, Cecil, General Grant
and Caledonian mines.
* * * *
A syndicate is testing the old Scottish
Targinnie formation, Gladstone (Q.),
where a 12ft. wide ore body has been
proved for 600 ft.; preliminary assays
averaged Bdwt. Near by, l£oz. crushings
have been taken from below the 100 ft.
level in the old No. 2 West Archer ; in
No. 1 West Archer an 18in. reef, carry-
ing good colors, has been struck at 160 ft.
A party is also prospecting the old
Commonwealth lode, from which good
crushings were obtained in the early days.
* * * *
A parcel of 3 tons 14cwt. from the
Larsen and Cooley, near Chudleigh Park
station in the Hughenden district (N.Q.),
returned 17oz. 6dwt. of gold. The reef
averages about 12in. in width, and a
shaft is down 50ft. Over 300 tons of
estimated ounce stuff is at grass, and a
battery is being erected.
* * * *
At Prospect Creek, about 35 miles
from Biloela (N.Q.), five distinct reefs,
averaging two feet in width, have been
traced for about two miles on the sur-
face. On the Elliott Bros.’ claims, where
several shafts are down to 20ft., assays
have shown high gold, silver and copper
values. A parcel is being sent to Chil-
lagoe for treatment.
* * * *
London and Australian investors are
finding cash to raise the Youanmi, on
the East Murchison field, and Tindals,
Coolgardie, from the dead. Youanmi
produced on a fairly large scale until
refractory ore at depth, high costs,, and
refusal of financial, assistance by the State
Government settled it. Tindals was one
of the earliest mines worked at Cool-
gardie. A Melbourne co. extracted about
£150,000 worth of gold from it. Share-
holders, however, got nothing; when
they refused to find further capital, opera-
tions ceased. In those days, however,
what was left behind was worth a little
more than half of what it is now.
* * * *
Pilbara, Westralia’s farthest north gold-
field next to Kimberley, is being rooted
here and there in comparatively shallow
ground with more or less satisfactory
results. Several prospectors around
Bamboo Creek are raising crushings, and
a few are doing well in other centres.
Last month over 400 tons was treated
at the Marble Bar State battery for an
average of 16dwt. There are many gold-
bearing veins on the Pilbara, but inacces-
sibility, which means high costs, has
retarded their development.
* * * *
Princess Royal, Westonia (W.A.), after
showing how a narrow quartz reef
should be worked, is keeping the Callion
mine in view as a possible centre of
future activities. Besides a good cash
balance, there are still some divs. in sight
in the Princess Royal lease. The 3ft.-
wide Callion lode has satisfactory values,
but there is a doubt about satisfactory
extraction.

Chairman John Waddington says that
Associated Northern has, in addition to
the £10,500 received for the Iron Duke,
some British Govt, bonds and a small
share interest in Gt. Boulder. These
investments appear at £23,990, but at
present prices they are worth a few
thousands more than that. The co. still
owns the Gimlet group, at Ora Banda.
Also, it is to get a 25 p.c. interest in
cash or shares in any co. formed to
work the Iron Duke.

Wiluna Gold Corp., London, an-
nounces that, of its £300,000 of 10 p.c.
convertible notes, £299,500 has been
converted into shares. Also, the 260,000
new shares offered to those on the regis-
ter have all been taken, with the excep-
tion of a small number representing the
rights of a few shareholders abroad.

Norseman (W.A.) cleaned up 3510 z.
of bullion during October. Values from
a stope in a rise on the 470 ft. level were
1255. over a width of 6ft.; the leading
stope in the south drive on the same level
averaged 2355. Values are figured with
gold at 140 s. per oz. A full clean-up
commenced on October 30, and there-
after will be made every four weeks.
* * * *
Great Boulder Prop. (W.A.), boring
east at a point 472 ft. south of the Hamil-
ton shaft on the 1950 ft. level, struck a
lode at 572 ft., continuing to 579 ft. The
width was 86in., and the average assay
17dwt. per ton. The lode is 145 ft. west
of the east boundary, and is believed, to
be part of the “X” lode series.

Sons of Gwalia’s recent shilling div.
makes a total of 2s. interim for 1933,
compared with Is. 6d. for the whole of
1932. Four shillings a year from now
onward is tipped by market bulls. A
substantial parcel of the shares which
recently came on the London market is
said to have been taken by a well-known
South African house. In addition to its
Gwalia mine, the co. has one or two
other strings to its bow in Westralia.
* * * *
Empress Gold, developing the Empress
lease at Coolgardie, has unwatered the
main shaft, and sampling will begin im-
mediately. The reef is believed to be
over 20ft. wide. Preparations are also
being made to unwater the north shaft.
* * * *
Wavic Development has exercised its
option over the Two Boys at Higginsville,
south of Kalgoorlie. A battery and
cyanide plant have been bought for £6OO.
The co. has not yet made up its mind
about the Two Boys Extended.

Metals Investigation Prop., which is
developing several leases at the southern
end of the Golden Mile, adjoining Lake
View and Star, has had a third clean-up
of 49 tons from the Lake View South
for an average of 18dwt. During the
last month 198 tons has been treated
for an average of 24dwt.
* * * *
To hasten development at the Carbine
(W.A.), rock drills and an air compressor
are being installed. The shaft has passed
through a new reef Bft. wide, carrying
Bdwt. The option, held by Adelaide in-
terests, has been extended until March,
1935.

Westralian gold yield for 1933 pro-
mises to be 30,0000 z. more than the 1932
output (604-710 oz.), and 125,0000 z.
greater than for 1931. For the nine
months to the end of Sept, the value
of the output was £3,544,827, of which
£1,560,018 was the premium on the old
statutory price. During the same period
the Perth Mint paid out £35,257 for old
gold.

SHADOW SHOWS.
After seeing Warner Oland in his chief
part several times —the latest being in
“Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case,” at the
Regent—this critic has come to the con-
clusion that, compared with leading Eng-
lish investigators, the Oriental is a dud.
He looks the essence of cunning, and his
aphorisms suggest hidden intellect; but
it soon becomes evident that without
strokes of luck, such as coming into
rooms while incriminating exhibits are
being shown round and finding cheques
in hotel drawers which ought to have
been locked, he wouldn’t discover any-
thing. He can’t reason like Sherlock
Holmes, and his adventures lack eeriness.
He offers, instead, certain human touches,
such as sly humor and a family of Lyons-
like dimensions.
The settings of his pictures are always
elaborate, but the casting, as in this one,
is usually indifferent.
In “Papa Loves Mama,” Charles
Ruggles is a timid, futile, amiable little
suburbanite with a habit of cracking
asinine jokes. He is to be found in every
community, and he has appeared on thou-
sands of stages and in stories by writers
as various as O. Henry, “Kodak,” Gros-
smith (“Diary of a Nobody”) and Anatole
France. Yet, probably because there is
something of him in most of us, he is
always welcome, and the same applies to
his wife, who is either a tyrant or, as
here, a worshipping bonehead. The other
characters are familiar, too —Ruggles’s
bellowing employer, whose sar’-major-like
facade hides a kind heart; his vulgar
neighbors and the still more vulgar pluto-
crats whom he and his wife get to know
when he rises in the world.
There are many novelties in the work-
ing out of the plot, which, though fantas-
tic, is made to appear plausible, and plenty
of new gags and situations. Nunally
Johnson, a true humorist, is said to have
written most of the lines. Mary Boland,
as the large, fussy, affectionate, snobbish
wife, is as realistic as Ruggles, and Lilyan
Tashman gives a superb portrait of a
noisy, back-slapping, hard-drinking Bright
Old Thing.

Most British producers of musical
comedies resemble the Bourbons in that
they forget nothing and learn nothing.
Jack Buchanan, who was responsible
for “Yes, Mr. Brown,” at the Mayfair,
couldn’t forget that Vienna once had a
vogue with American directors (for no
better reason, artistically, than that the
Parisians had begun to be rude to their
American creditors), so he proceeded to
turn himself and his equally British
colleagues into Viennese. If he had been
able to forget Vienna, and remember
that London has its Selfridge’s and
Harrod’s, staffed by people not unlike
himself and the lady who plays his
secretary, the show would have been
more realistic ; and, if he had been cap-
able of learning that film-addicts are sick
of the plot about the lady who causes
complications by masquerading as the
hero’s wife, the proceedings would have
been more interesting.
Buchanan, tall, handsome, impeccably
dressed, does all his old stuff, such
as falling backwards into a pool of
water, appearing before a shocked damsel
in his shirt, and first smacking and then
pretending to love his wife’s pet dog.
He overacts, particularly with his mobile
face, as strenuously as ever. The prin-
cipal girls wear clothes that might have
been made in West Kensington. Vera
Pearce, who plays a comic maid of the
tray-dropping school, isn’t bad ; and the
settings and several of the songs are
attractive.
“Up for the Derby” features Sydney
Howard. He is England’s answer to
Oliver Hardy, and he might be a smash-
ing one in a film with a few new ideas.
This one consists largely of mirth-pro-
vokers which were well stricken in years
when Joe Miller was young. The booby-
trap over the door, the burst trousers,
the misfortunes with policemen, pawn-
brokers and bailiffs —all are there. Yet
the comedian’s fluttering, old-maidish
ways are so essentially ludicrous, and his
personality is so strong and likeable, that
he never gets tiresome. In any case, as
every film-distributor knows, there is an
immense public for chestnuts. The laugh-
ter at the Mayfair on Thursday night
was uproarious.

The setting of “The Mayor of Hell,”
at the Capitol, is a State reformatory for
boys, conducted by brutal Dudley Digges.
James Cagney, a racketeer, as a reward
for political services, is made a sort of
overlord of the place. He falls for
Madge Evans and backs her up in
humanitarian notions which include a
self-government scheme, better grub and
the abolition of warders. And so, in
Heaven’s good time, the machinations of
the unspeakable Digges are brought to
naught, and he meets an ignoble death
in a pigsty.
The best of the bunch is Frankie Dar-
row, the youngster who is elected Mayor
by his comrades under the Gargan regime.
Digges is impossible, and Gargan is only
faintly possible. The boys, who include
that soft-spoken elocutionist Farina, give
the . fantasia such verisimilitude as it
possesses.
In “The Last Trail” an unmarried
couple who have pretended to be mar-
ried are compelled, by the solicitude of
a hostess who spends several hours sniff-
ing round their door, to stay together till
breakfast-time. (As Ripley has not yet
pointed out, the dramatic fiction regarding
the existence of such hostesses has worn
out 1437 stage floors and used up
1,933,467,683 feet of celluloid ribbon.)
There is a comic character who, in addi-
tion to being insane, is addicted to hooch;
also a gang of crooks so inept that what
the rightful heir (George O’Brien) and
the detectress (Claire Trevor) are going
to do to them is obvious from the jump.

“Adorable,” at the Prince Edward, is a
bantamweight musical romance with
many agreeable numbers and a Central
European kingdom as its splendiferous
background.
Janet Gaynor is the sweet little princess
who yearns to get away from it all for a
while. She seeks romance at a servants’
ball. Forward, Henry Garat! Janet
thinks he owns a ham-and-beef shop ; he
thinks she is a manicurist.
Among the many clever people who
are interested in their love affair are C.
Aubrey Smith, as a pompous Prime
Minister, and Herbert Mundin, as a
comic secret-service man.

This is an odd world and more of its
oddities get into movie-picture palaces
nowadays than into any other temple of
the arts. On Saturday at Melb. Capitol,
which looks like the inside of a shark’s
mouth illuminated by colored lights, the
writer was gazing apathetically at the
screen when he suddenly became aware
that he was watching General de Pinedo
being burned alive. All over Australia
this stout, smiling yet vaguely anxious-
looking little Italian flier in the comic felt
hat is being grilled at three sessions daily
for the delight of movie fans. Or is it an
educational feature?
Before he had recovered from the
shock the writer was surveying Ernest
Roll’s latest revue. Fortunately the revue
turned out to be a first-class example of
Mr. Rolls’s special art. If Renee Riano’s
aimless jokes hadn’t somehow seemed
funnier than the polished wit; if the
ballets hadn’t been as lush as lovely limbs
and lack of clothes could make them,
and if the producer’s idea of a Parisian
atelier hadn’t been as mad as a southerly
buster in a strait-waistcoat, the writer
would have emerged from the Capitol
with the aroma of singed flesh in his
mind’s nostrils; and that is not what a
picture-theatre is for.
The accompanying film, “Midnight
Club,” is about a gang of crooks dis-
guised as gentlemen who mix with a select
party and are betrayed by one of their
number, a girl, who has fallen in love
with one of the real gentlemen. Clive
Brook, George Raft and Alison Skip-
worth are in it.
Sundry Shows
“Tout Paris,” the Rolls musical show
which moved into Sydney Cri. last Satur-
day, has a misleading title. Except for
the opening scene the fantasia has very
little to do with Paris. About three dozen
variety turns make up the two long acts,
and these are mostly snappy and well-
staged. The scenery of the second act is
particularly well planned, and provides an
effective background for various colorful
spectacles. The millinery parade is a
blaze of prismatic hues, and “The Birth
of a Melody” scena (in which Gershwin
is associated with Bach) exhibits a tasteful
arrangement of curtains and lighting.
“My Treasure Girl,” wherein the girls
represent various gems, is charmingly con-
ceived, and “La Cage Pourpre,” with the
ballet in the role of a bevy of cubs, is
original and bright. The honors of the
show belong to Jack and Sylvia Kellaway.
A big hit is made by Clarkson Rose, who
impersonates a panto, star long past her
prime, and Peggy Wynne apes Greta
Garbo amusingly. The usual feature of
Rolls shows —scantiness of feminine attire
—is prominent, and many of the jests
have blue edges.

Raymond Beatty, who took his nice
voice—a baritone —to England to have it
polished, gave a recital at Sydney Con.
Hall one night last week. His enuncia-
tion is clearer than before he went away,
and he declaimed Wagner and Handel
numbers impressively. In “The Erl King”
he seemed to be more occupied with
problems of voice production than with
Goethe’s poignant story, and the same
preoccupation handicapped his carolling
of the narrative in Korbay’s “Had a
Horse.” Devotion to the minutiae of vocal
technique is a good thing, but it is a
physic that should be flung to the dogs
by a singer when it begins to sap vitality
of presentation.
Ghosts of poor little Madame Butter-
fly and her associates were abroad on
Wednesday night, and radio sets con-
veyed to the inmates of a thousand
homes an intimation that the course of
Cho-Cho-San’s love was not running
smoothly. But “Butterfly” is not very
satisfactory fare for the blind, so much
of Puccini’s music depending for its signi-
ficance upon its appropriateness, not only
to action, but to the impressions created
by scenery, lighting and costumes.
Madame’s night-long vigil, the dramatic
backbone of the book, the play and the
opera, simply cannot be expressed per
radio. However, the music was creditably
presented. Millie Hughes realised the
pathos of the name-role; Lionello Cecil
made it clear that Pinkerton was very
sorry for himself; Evelyn Hall, as
Suzuki, the most sensible person in the
outfit, radiated commonsense and sym-
pathy, and Franco Izal doubled Sharpless
and the Bonze very capably. Wando
Aldrovandi’s conducting was capital.

The A.B.C. Brahms-Wagner festival was
continued all last week. Tuesday’s con-
cert at Melb. Wilson Hall was concerned
principally with the Brahms Symphony
No. 4, Klingsor’s “Magic Garden” and
the Flower Maidens’ Chorus from “Par-
sifal.” On Thursday, at the Wilson Hall,
Edward Goll emerged after a long period
of sickness and gave the Brahms Con-
certo, op. 83. Charles Nicis, Alan Eddy
and Ernest Wilson were the soloists in the
Grail scene from “Parsifal,” and their
singing was satisfactory, but a cast hop-
ping up and down on cane chairs and
nudging each other out of the way was
a poor substitute for the colorful drama-
tic spectacle Wagner devised. Saturday’s
event packed the Town Hall. Brahms’s
placid Symphony No. 2 was firmly
handled by the hard-working Uni.
Orchestra and the hard-worked Prof.
Heinze. Act 111 of “The Valkyrie” filled
the long second part. Isobel Walsh, Isis
Williams, Mirielle de Civrieux, Freda
Northcote, Selma Bergstrand, Lotti
Daniell, Freda Stevens and Milly Trindar
were the savage equestriennes of the
dread Valkyrie ride, which was well
understood by the singers but occa-
sionally drowned by the transports of
the orchestra. Mirielle de Civrieux sang
two parts with a voice that was arresting
and filled the auditorium; Alice Orff-
Solscher was a Brunhilde of commanding
power, and Walter Kingsley bestowed a
competent vocal organ on Wotan. A
fortnight of distinguished music closed
with the divine strains of the orchestra
surrounding Brunhilde-Solscher with a
ring of fire.

Time was when an Australian audience
would have been shocked at the humor
of Stuart and Lash, American comedians
newly come to Melb. Tiv., but that time
is apparently past. Whether this indi-
cates an advance in civilisation or a
Back-to-the-Coarse movement, present
critic is too cautious to say. Apart from
their favorite theme the pair can produce
a good sketch, such as “Kentucky Feud.”
For the rest of the show, the ballets are
active and numerous, the settings un-
usually elaborate, and there is a lady
who sings songs so full of yearn that
even the candelabra drop self-pitying
tears.

“And So to Bed,” the Pepysian comedy
staged by the Proscenium Club at Melb.
Comedy on Saturday, suffers from the
disadvantage of being based on a histori-
cal personage. If you are acquainted
with him you have your own ideas about
him, and they are almost certain to dif-
fer from the playwright’s. If you have
never heard of him before, the play is
likely to be as unsatisfying a clue to him
as a set of illustrations torn out of a
book you don’t happen to have read.
Edgar Veitch’s Samuel Pepys was amus-
ing, though overacted, and Marguerite
Cockerton’s Mrs. Pepys was good,
though whether she was like the histori-
cal original nobody will ever know.

The Experimental Theatre group pre-
sented at Sydney Savoy Daisy Fisher’s
“Lavender Ladies,” a London success of
eight years ago. The ladies are the Misses
Anne and Rose. To their country home
comes April Clear, who typifies the post-
war flapper. She shocks her hostesses but
finds their sympathy and understanding
very helpful when trouble descends upon
her young shoulders. Although her stay
is a disturbing one it is apparent that it
has not materially affected the outlook of
the elderly ladies, which is much the same
at the end of the play as it was at the
beginning ; but Barbara Young and Marie
Hemingway did not succeed in making
them convincing. Alix Lamb was more
at home as the stormy young intruder,
and Doris Wood (Tabitha), Max van
Hemert (April’s lover) and Edward
Howell (April’s father) fitted fairly com-
fortably into the picture. Therese Des-
mond produced and Edward Howell and
Don Finley did the scenery.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Yamagi”: Was talking to a couple of
the station blacks the other day about
fights between snakes and goannas, and
they told me of the ingenious methods
employed by a certain sort of go’. “He
big black one, you know, callum bobby
goanna, and when ’nake go for him
bobby goanna just open his mouth so
’nake run right down inside. Bobby
goanna then he run to tree ; up, up he
go till he get to bough ; then he jump
off, land right on his belly ; then he stop,
listen, and, if ’nake move, he run to
’nother tree and jump off again. He do
this till he kill ’nake ; then eatum up.”
I don’t believe it, but that doesn’t prove
it isn’t true.

“Jimmy Rua”: Nationality has no-
thing to do with dialect. Spelling at
Charleroi after the Armistice we met a
boy about eight years old and plied
him with questions in pidgin-French.
The youngster replied, “I dinna ken
what ye’re sayin’! Ye talk like the
maister at the schule yonder, where I
gang tae!” “And how do you get on
at school?” queried a Scotch-Australian
soldier. “Nae gude ava! The maister
ca’s me a ‘gossoon’! I’m nae ane!” “He

means ‘garsong,’ ” said the Digger; “a
boy.” “Ah, weel! I’m a wee laddie, and
no’ a ‘garsong’; me feyther and mither,
they speak funny tae, and me feyther
aye ca’s me Pierre, but at the schule in
Glesga the maister ca’d me ‘Peter lad-
die.’ ” By further questioning we found
that the lad, at the outbreak of the war,
was taken, with hundreds of other Bel-
gian refugees, to Scotland. He was an
infant at the time, and five years’ resi-
dence in the land of McHaggis had
developed an accent as thick as Highland
brose and as full of burrs as a Bathurst
cow-paddock.
“C.A.8.”: A Cooma (N.S.W.) farmer,
stacking bags of chaff, unknowingly im-
prisoned in a very small space the house
cat. The farmer’s wife, 20 days later,
searching for her pet, heard faint cries,
which led to puss’s release. In a few
hours it was almost frisky again.
* * * *
“Colon”: “Dai R.’s” story (B.
25/10/’33) about a knife-blade he found
that had been drilled through by wood-
boring insects is easily explained. The
borers desired to make up
a deficiency of iron in
their systems. Before the
introduction of balanced
feeding and mineral-salt
licks, a neighbor of mine
had a cow that developed
an insatiable appetite for
old tins, bits of wire, etc.,
and had to be repeatedly
chased from the black-
smith’s shop. The butter
factory complained of a
rusty taste in the cream,
and the cow was isolated ;
but you couldn’t keep
temptation out of her way
as when deprived of other
sources of supply she
would tackle the fencing-
wires. In a short time the
iron content in her milk
grew so great that it had
to be carried from the
bails a pint at a time to
avoid its weight tearing
the bottom out of the
bucket. The owner com-
menced bottling this milk
and selling it as an iron
tonic. But the morning
after the anvil disappeared
from the blacksmith’s shop the cow
essayed to swim the waterhole in the
creek and sank like a stone.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Broken Hill people
once believed that a spook haunted Block
10 mine. At the 300 ft. level a boring
machine had struck an unexploded
charge of dynamite, which went off and
killed two workmen. The miners’ code
decreed that no men should work at the
scene of a fatality until three months
had elapsed ; then a gang of Cousin Jacks
went there to work. During crib-time
they heard an uncanny hissing noise and
beheld two balls of fire oscillating in
mid-air at the very scene of the accident.
They jerked at the cage and left work
immediately. Other parties had the same
experience, and after a while no one
could be induced to work there. Then
a gang of strong-minded fellows volun-
teered to clear up the mystery. Ap-
proaching the spectre’s haunt well-armed,
they saw, just beyond the flare of light
from their candles, the slowly moving
balls of fire and heard the low moaning
hiss. They halted. Their guns hung
loosely at their sides, while fear of the
unknown struck at their hearts. Without
firing a shot and in dead silence they
turned and hastened from the shaft. At
the top they looked at one another,
ashamed, and resolved to go back. It
was arranged that upon observing the
spectre their leader should count three,
then all would fire. They returned to the
old working. Again the balls of fire
floated before them, and again they
heard the low hissing sound. Slowly the
leader counted “0ne.... tw0”.... then
hesitated, afraid to speak the fateful
word. In that pause the plaintive bleat
of a billygoat saved its life. Goats were
plentiful about the mines, and this one,
having fallen down the shaft, had been
living on scraps from the miners’ cribs.

“Old Q.”: That par. about luminous
fungus (B. 18/10/’33) reminds me that in
North Queensland in the days the Taxa-
tion Commissioner hath eaten we used
fireflies for emergency lighting. They
gave a much brighter light than fungus
and, unlike that unholy plant, did not
smell when they aged. At the evening
“I notice you pass that hotel you used to go into, Jacky. How do you do it?”
“Fix my mind on the next pub, boss.”
parties of those simple days the girls
used to stick fireflies in their hair, and
very nice they looked when one went for
a stroll down the garden after a waltz.
The only trouble was that the insect illu-
minants could be located in the darkness
by the oldest of chaperons, and, as the
girls sported elaborate coiffures, covered
with fine nets, getting the betraying illu-
minants out to dodge detection was too
long a business to be worth attempting.

“Stewart W.”: Kava? In 1866 the
Comte de Beauvoir visited Australia,
and on his return to France he pub-
lished his diary. Writing on October
13, 1866, he describes a visit to the head-
quarters of the Marist Brothers at
Hunter’s Hill, Sydney. The Bishop of
the Navigator’s Islands happened to be
there. The visitors were rowed from
the river steamer by eight young
Samoans. At sunset these young
islanders, dressed in their native costume,
executed a slow dance and then squatted
round the kava bowl. De Beauvoir
describes the preparation of the drink
and then goes on: “The young men
brought each of us a carved bowl, made
from a cocoanut, full of the beverage
and we drank it. I thought I was tak-
ing some sort of medicine, but was quite
surprised to find at the first gulp that it
had a piquant and rather pleasant taste :
at the second I realised that the stuff
was potent enough to make hair grow
on a bald man’s head, and fortunately I
took warning.”

“Boomslang”: Snake experts will
mourn the death of Dr. Leon Charles
Calmette in his native France. A direc-
tor of the Pasteur Institute and a scient-
ist of many interests, he gained especial
fame as one of the first men to seriously
study snake venoms and their action and
to attempt to discover a serum which
would act as an antidote. He had some
success in the matter of individual snake
poisons, but his dream of a universal
antidote was not fulfilled. Still, he laid
the rails for later experimenters, and in
South Africa and Australia considerable
progress has been made on the route of
which he was one of the pioneers.

“Cetacea”: As a citizen of Australia
{vide Australian Antarctic Territory Ac-
ceptance Act) may I bring under notice
the heartrending case of a matron of my
family? A 60ft.~ mother whale with
calf at foot came within the purview of
an Auckland fisherman who was trailing
a seine net from a motor-launch. The
fisherman had equipped himself with a
large-bore repeater rifle and dum-durn
bullets so that he could go big-game
hunting if opportunity arose. When he
saw ma whale he pumped her full of
lead, and when her carcass lay still on
the surface he stepped on to it and made
play with a hatchet in her fluke, so that he
might tow her back to port, forgetting,
apparently, that Maoriland’s whaling
days lie in a long-dead past. As the
chopper bit into her tissues the mother
whale mustered up her ganglions and
gave one last tremendous kick. The
Fates decreed that the gesture should
cast the fish-catcher back on his own
deck. He showed his gratitude to the
sisters of the loom by picking up his fire-
arm and burying another 12s. 6d. worth
of ammunition in Mrs. Whale. Then,
determined to make a Roman triumph
of it, he got a rope round the old girl’s
rudder and carried on with the towing
job. But he had to reckon with the
orphan. This noble youngster said to
himself, “Oho! Mother assassinated and
abducted? What can a little child do?”
So, though backward for his age, owing
to a bad attack of colic in infancy, he
decided to give the launch a birl. He
butted it frequently with his nose, poor
little twenty-footer, and it took the craft
eight hours to travel the twelve miles
from a spot in the sea known to us
whales as Whangapaikoparawhenua to
.the nearest beach, known even to the
newspapers as Whangaparapara. The
child was repeatedly stabbed in the nose
with a boat-hook, but these insults it
ignored. Even when mamma’s carcass
had been beached and the launch sought
to get back to its moorings in Auckland
Harbor, the child still pursued it. A P.A.
message phrases the end of the epic suc-
cinctly: “Forty-five shots fired but as
would not leave launch returned.”

“Brilliant Deeps”: Let me also put in
a good word for Oswald Pryor’s Cousin
Jacks (B. 1/11/’33). The first time I
met them was on Charters Towers in the
early ’nineties, before Pryor’s drawings
began to appear. At that time nearly
every mine manager was a Cap’n and
fully two-thirds of the underground men
had names beginning with Tre, Pol or
Pen. Later I found Johannesburg to be
also full of them and, like the Towers,
a place where it wasn’t safe to ask in
public “who hanged the monkeys?” With
that experience I am prepared to swear
through a four-inch board, and to back
the oath with real money if necessary,
that Pryor’s Cornishmen are of real vin-
tage. Whether the generation of to-day
follow in the footsteps of their dads is
another matter. There can be no doubt
about the old brigade, who lived, talked
and dressed in the actual habit as Pryor
has immortalised it.

“Frigid”: Evidently “Walkabout” (B.
25/10/’33) refers to the broad-leaf bottle-
tree (Sterculia trichosiphon ) when he
maintains that the bottle-tree contains
very little water and is valueless as stock
fodder. For nearly 18 months our 30
cows subsisted entjrely on the narrow-
leaf tree (S. rupestris ), eating about one
a week. Once you bore a hole in the
trunk, water trickles out and continues
to do so for months. We found it better
to saw the tree up in short sections after
the bark was removed ; these were split
in narrow strips with an axe and
then fed through a chaff-cutter, mixed
with a little bran. When cows are
allowed to feed off a log, the strips of
pith are not properly masticated, and
are liable to cause trouble. The trees
grown in gardens are poor-looking com-
pared with wild specimens.
THE STICKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A sport? Well, you might call him that,” said
Larry from the ’Loo;
“At least he played for all ’twas worth the only
game he knew.
He’d stick it out through thick and thin; he
never squealed or squalled;
You’d always see him on his toes till six o’clock
was called.
“He never ran a hundred yards in even time, 1
guess,
But you could safely bet he’d sink the coldest
pint in less.
If Bungs were only trusting souls about their
malt and hop,
He’d soon have rattled up a score that Bradman
couldn’t top.
“He never swung a golfing club or racquet, like
as not,
But workmanlike his fingers gripped the handle
of a pot.
Firm as a rock he’d take his block before the
bar. Gee-whiz!
I never knew another chap who had a stance
like his.
“I doubt he ever put his hands in gloves or
stoushed or smote,
But if he lacked a dirty left he had a drouthy
throat.
Lord, spare me days! I never met on this here
rolling sphere
A bloke who sparred so deadly hard from
morn to night for beer!”

“Lynch’s Farm”: Others beside Mexi-
cans have gone to the ant for its aid as
an auxiliary in ridding clothing of
“chats” (B. 1/11/’33). In the South
African War sophisticated sufferers made
a regular practice of it, and with great
success. They did not resort to the
“Could you spare a coupla bob for coffee?”
“Two shillings for coffee? Preposterous!”
“Jist say ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ sport — don’ try ter tell a bloke ’ow to run ’ees bizness.”
builders of the countless red anthills which
dotted the veld, since they are termites
and apt to eat the clothing with the rest.
There is a breed of small black ants
which live in the hollow thorns of an
acacia common in most parts of S. Africa.
These ferocious little brutes sally forth
whenever anyone touches their host and
fall on the aggressor in biting and odori-
ferous thousands. The procedure was to
hang the garments on a branch and give
the latter a good shake. After a decent
interval the clothing would be removed —
at the end of a long stick for choice
and thrown to the ground near by. In
a few minutes it would be deserted by
the ants, who would by this time be back
in their thorn fastnesses on the tree wait-
ing for the next job. The Kaffir, who
holds records even among the world’s
most ignoble savages for harboring para-
sites, was the inventor of this dry-clean-
ing method, and his Boer overlords did
not disdain to follow his example when
necessary.
* * * *
“Myhree”: Twenty years ago a young
colt, saddled and bridled, escaped into
the rough country at the head of the
Rose River (n.-e. Vic.). Fifteen years
later its skeleton was found not 10 miles
from where it had escaped, the saddle
and bridle gone, but the girth, which
evidently had supported for years a
saddle that had slipped under its belly,
still in place. The backbone had thrown
up a formation which had grown right
round the leather, in much the same
way as a tree will overgrow a wire band.
How long that horse lived or what
agonies it suffered before it died, no one
will ever know, but it is considered that
at least 10 years was necessary to form
the grisly arch.
* * * *
“Searchlight”: When a female mantis
gets annoyed with her husband she wastes
no time in reproaches. A pair occupied
a window curtain at our home for some
weeks. One day, without warning, the
lady grabbed hubby tightly around the
waist with her powerful serrated front
legs. When she released her hold he was
in two sections and her matrimonial
troubles were over.
* * * *
“Spero”: In a Soviet report on the
emu-acclimatising experiment (which is
said to be proving very successful, and
it may be—from Russian standards), it is
declared that the emu is a bird with
edible flesh and that its eggs contain
from 600 to 700 grammes of nutritious
food. For the present, eggs are being
used only for breeding, giant incubators
having been constructed. The introduc-
tion of Australian fauna (the term in-
eludes rabbits) into Russia was entrusted
to the Central Zoological Department at
Moscow. The department started a kan-
garoo farm at Maikop, in South Russia,
stocked with a hundred couples of kan-
garoos, and it is announced that this ex-
“Can anyone tell me what is a spinster?”
“Please, miss, a spinster’s a lady wot plays two-up."
periment was also successful. The Kroli-
kovodkolkhoztsentr (Central Rabbit Col-
lective Farming Department), on *the
other hand, reports that its efforts have
come to a dead end, as the rabbits refuse
to multiply.
* * * *
“7NX”: Concerning abo. letter sticks
(B. 25/10/’33). Some years ago an old
hand in the Gulf told me he had come to
the conclusion that the stick itself did
not incorporate the message, but merely
signified that the bearer had some news
to impart, which he did by word of
mouth. Just as the representative of an
important personage often carried the
latter’s signet-ring as his authority, so
does the Binghi Mercury carry a letter
stick to authenticate his mission.
* * * *
“Dai R.”: Although the ordinary
earthworm is fond of damp ground, it
sinks like a stone in water and drowns
quickly. During protracted rains it bur-
rows downwards ; in sudden floods it for-
sakes the earth and seeks refuge in soil-
filled cracks of timber. At Walgett
(N.S.W.) in the ’9O flood the wooden
bridge over the Namoi appeared as if
painted red. so vast was the concourse of
worms seeking shelter on it. The wrig-
gling army attracted a multitude of prey-
ing birds. The same thing happened at
Ti-tree Creek, Tabulam (N.S.W.), in the
recent North Coast flood. Tick Inspec-
tor Ernie Cheshire, who, as the district’s
earliest riser, was the first to see the
show, says he wouldn’t have believed it
if he hadn’t seen it.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: At a sleeper-cutters’ camp
near Wolumla, South Coast, N.S.W., I
witnessed a contest of a sort new to me.
A plug of tobacco was the prize for the
man who could boil his billycan in the
shortest time. You had to gather leaves,
grass and wood, light a fire, race to the
creek and fill the billy with water, put
it on and stoke the fire until it boiled.
There were six competitors, and the
winner had his billy boiling in less than
six minutes.
* * * *
“Rab”: Last February I was travelling
by car up the Nebine, south-west
Queensland, passing through open mulga
country. About sundown I saw, lying
in the wheel-track, what at first glance I
took to be a bright-red scarf, but, draw-
ing nearer, discovered to be a snake,
He moved out of the wheel-track and
darted across the front of the car. I had a
shot at running over him but failed, so I
stopped Lizzie and went back. Much to
my surprise, Mr. Snake was coming after
the car. He had not attended any dis-
armament conferences, for there was
more fight in him than in any crawler I
ever met. All that l could find to wade
into him with was rotten mulga sticks,
which broke at the first hit, and he fol-
lowed me up while 1 fought him with
these weapons. Finally he slithered into
a dead fallen mulga about the same
time that I got a good waddy, and,
though he kept well in amongst the dead
sticks, he never turned tail, but fought
all the time. At last I settled him.
He had a scarlet back with a pinkish
belly, and was about five feet six long, if
I meet any of his brothers or sisters I’ll
pass on hurriedly.
* * * •*
“O’L.”: “Pakeha” is of Polynesian
origin, and has been used from time im-
memorial. It denotes a stranger or
foreigner and does not necessarily refer
to a white man, though it is derived
from Pakehakeha, which signifies legend-
ary fair-skinned spirits or fairies.
* * * *
“Joe Joe”: Let me tell “Quidseeker”
(B. 11/10/’33) that no cold-blooded
creeper can be poisoned by another
crawler. A snake’s venom consists of
potash and phosphates that the snake
collects through his skin as he is crawling
along the ground. The richer and more
fertile the ground, the more he collects.
When he bites, the venom thickens the
blood ; and when the blood goes through
the brain it clogs, arid death follows.
Last year my dog was bitten by a brown
snake. I saw him bitten, and carried him
home about a hundred yards, put him
in a tub of cold water and kept pouring
cold water on him for two hours. He
was then past danger. By reducing the
dog’s temperature to something like the
snake’s the blood-clotting in the brain
is prevented. Blacks have told me that
dingoes cure themselves this way when
near water.
**■ * *
“C. Coral”: A nine-foot crocodile, cap-
tured a few weeks ago up Darwin way,
on being cut open yielded up some bones
(which may have been human) and a
curious oval-shaped stone, milky-white,
somewhat like a clam-shell pearl in
appearance. Whether the croc, swallowed
the pebble, whether it came from a
clam-shell, or whether it developed in
the beast’s stomach in some other way
is a matter of conjecture. Has any mem-
ber of the Council a theory?

the verdict. The hapless child, it seemed,
had not been smitten with phthisis, gastro-
enteritis, infantile paralysis, chicken-
pox, measles, scarlet fever, mumps or
X-disease. No. Hearing that an apple
a day would keep the doctor away, he
had consumed at one heroic gorge suf-
ficient apples to safeguard his health for
a fortnight!

SPRING IS HERE!
Seasonable thoughts for the umpteen
thousand Australian poets who are bud-
ding—or thudding:
Poetry.is like murder; it will out.
The earliest English poetry was written
in Gaelic., After the Renaissance
Italians butted in and it became a blend
of Gaelic and garlic.
The Scandinavian scalds left a great
impression on English poetry. We never
knew a scald that didn’t.
When Edward I.
conquered Wales he
ordered a massacre
of the local bards.
Hence the affection
the Welsh had for
him.
Chaucer was the
first man to make
poetry pay ; Edward
111. granted him
an annuity of one
tun of wine. In re-
turn he proceeded
to give a ton of
cheek with his
“Canterbury Tales,”
“Randwick Rumors”
and “Robbery-Park
Ramps.”
The Scottish bards
did nothing to
speak of after free
verse was .invented.
England 'has a Poets’ Corner in West-
minster Abbey. The Australian Poets’
Corner is practically any corner with a
pub on it.

THE BLOWHARD GROUP.
A teeming crowd, composed of mem-
bers of Sydney’s hyper-cultured Blow-
hard Group, attended an exhibition of
pictures by members of the Group yes-
terday. After speeches, in which Gal-
lery Trustees and Sydney picture-buyers
were condemned as besotted ignorami
for concCrtedly ignoring the new. cult of
Blowhardismus, the artists proceeded to
admire one another’s masterpieces.
Rapture was
evoked by the
work of the Coo-
gee gagaist Miss
Sadie Blobson.

holist Gas.per

while in a recumbent position. All her
exhibits, numbering 27, are still unsold.
So much for Sydney’s taste!
Mr. Alf Guff’s tender,, thoughtful “My
Ma” has also failed to find a buyer,
though carried out in seven different
shades of green, with puce stripes across
the nose, which, for the sake of origin-
ality, has been placed above the old
lady’s only eye.

duced), which de-

dressing the Ver-
sailles Confer-
ence, was offered
to the Gallery
Trustees for 7s.

Could ignorance
and provincialism
further go?
Mr. Horace
Blurbster’s “Lady
Game” (also re-
produced) speaks
for itself. When his Excellency first saw
it he swooned. Lady Game does not
propose to buy the work, though 12s. is
probably neither here nor there to her.
She feels that Australia should not lose
it. “Rembrandt himself couldn’t have
done it,” she is said to have remarked.
“I will not de-
prive Sydney of

THE CLUTCHING HAND. .
Chudley certainly had a grasping dis-
position. He had been seized at an early
age with his own importance, and took
everything, including the bottle, measles,
mumps, the cane and a job in a money-
lender's office, where he immediately
started to take notice, the petty cash and
interest from his friends. He soon
secured a grip of financial methods and
on other people’s property, so that he
and his grip soon became a feature of
city life. He grabbed every chance of
getting on. Then the ’flu epidemic
arrived and he naturally took it. Now
he has a mortgage on six feet of earth
not included in the residuary estate over
which his grasping relatives are fighting.

THE DEBATE.
“The N.S.W. C. 1.8. has formed a debating
society, of which Detective-Inspector Prior is
patron.”
The housebreaker extended a friendly
hand to his captor.
“Detective Spruiker, I believe. Well,
well, well! As president of the House-
breakers and Safecrackers’ Debating
Club I’ve long wanted to challenge your
society to a friendly war of words. Ha!
Ha! How do you like ‘ls it a Fair Cop?’
as a subject?”
“Oddly enough,” interjected the house-
holder, emerging from under the bed,
“I happen to be president of the Pinker-
ville Presbygregational Debating Society.”
“.Splendid,” cried the burglar. “I move
you take the chair.”
The detective felt that the prestige of
the C.1.8.D.C. was at stake.
“Mr. President and —er —gentlemen,” he
began. “In moving ‘This Is a Fair Cop’
I would like first to point out that the
prisoner”
“Point of order, Mr. Chairman!” in-
terjected the president of the H. and S.
D.C. “Can the speaker refer to the
Opposition as ‘the prisoner’?”
“Point of order sustained,” said the
chairman.
The detective’s zeal as a debater was
only whetted by the setback. Getting
well into his elocutionary stride, he
extended an admonishing forefinger,
thumped the palm of one hand with the
fist of the other, outlined what the next
speaker would say and demolished his
arguments.
“Where’s the leader of the Opposi-
tion?” he demanded.
“I gave him leave,” said the chairman,
“to go to the library for a copy of ‘The
Rules of Debate.’ ”
The detective applied the closure to
himself without delay, but his search
was fruitless. He is still looking for a
man with the voice, appearance and some
of the idiosyncrasies of a politician.

A PEPYS INCIDENT.
Last night I did reach my home in a
pretty toss, for the wine at the banquet
had been overproof.
My wife having gotten me on to the
bed, I was for rising, being still athirst.
But the good lady, she be skilled with hei
needle, which she doth manipulate with
exceeding speed, and when I would rise
and imbibe again I did find that I could
not.
And sew to bed.’

MAIDEN’S PRAYER.
“Go !” she implored?“ For Heaven’s sake,
Delay no more!” Her eyes spoke woe.
Her gentle voice was heard to shake :
“Oh, Henry! If you love me — go!”
He smiled, her tortured soul to mock ;
Her mood to madness grew akin.
She shrieked, “It’s dam’ near six o’clock !
• Go out at once and get the gin !”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Hall Mark cannot be regarded as a
model of consistency. In September he
was beaten by Waltzing Lily and Break
Up in the Memsie Stakes at Caulfield.
This caused the Heroic colt to go out in
less demand than Blixten in the A.J.C.
Derby; yet he romped home, Blixten
being third. Returning to Melbourne,
the liver-colored chestnut struck his
colors to Palphar in the Caulfield
Guineas; and weak-hearted admirers
feared that no more spring victories
would be registered by Kellow’s colt.
Jack Holt, the trainer, remained con-
fident. He gave Hall Mark a brief let-
up after the Guineas failure, and this
worked wonders. Kellow helped himself
to a big serve of the comparatively
liberal odds offered against Hall Mark
in the Victoria Derby, one wager that
he secured being £2OOO to £BOO.
Betting on the Flemington classic was
largely confined to three horses, Hall
Mark starting at' 9 to 4 (5 to 2 could be
got here and there), Blixten at 3 to 1,
and Trivento at 7 to 2. Of the other
seven runners, Palphar alone started at
less than a double-figure quote. The
warmth of support for Trivento was the
outstanding feature of the wagering.
Melbourne newspapers had been placard-
ing this colt as “the mystery horse,” be-
GiERTI "I A.LVStfCi’S
BERT’. " R\rdok me dovjbtimg, you,
Geßt
<Gertl (/ Whv should you oouerr
ME ? "
Bert', "Because you t/klk. such
lot!"
cause of his having raced on only one
occasion before the Derby. Fact was
that James Scobie, knowing Trivento to
be purely a stayer, had set him for a
Derby and Cup triumph.
Never was there such a “false alarm”
as the son of Trivalve. His veteran
jockey, Bob Lewis, had been praying
for a snorting pace from the rise of the
barrier. He exulted when Palphar
dashed to the front and spreadeagled the
field. However, half a mile had not
been traversed when Trivento was pal-
pably beaten. Lewis attributed this to
the inexperience and nervousness of
Ernest Clarke’s colt. Trivento was tem-
peramentally disturbed by horses passing
him on the outside, and he refused to
stretch out. On learning that Hall Mark
had equalled the record for the race
(2min. 31|sec.), Lewis declared that Tri-
vento was capable of having covered the
mile and a half in 2min. 30sec. “I
would be willing,” he said, “to back
Trivento against any horse in Australia
for £lOOO over that distance at level
weights.” It is to be hoped, for the
old ’un’s sake, that no one will take
him up.
Palphar made a noble attempt to run
away with the Derby. He showed no
sign of faltering at any stage, but had
to accept defeat when supplanted by Hall
Mark, who drew away to win in the most
brilliant fashion by five lengths. Mira-
mond surprised by being in the picture
all the way and finishing third, just in
advance of Blixten, whose poor display
disgusted both the trainer, George Price,
and McCarten. Considering that horses
had to face a strong head wind in the
straight, Hall Mark’s time was better
than that of Phar Lap, whose record he
equalled.
The Derby victory at Flemington
brought Hall Mark’s stake earnings to
£12,564. His sire, Heroic, won over
£38,000 before retiring to the stud;
most of this went into the pocket of
Kellow, who bought him at auction
as a three-year-old for 16,000 guineas.
Plucky as the speculation was, Kel-
low has made a handsome profit. He
still owns Heroic, who has been leased
as a stallion and brings in a big annual
revenue. Unquestionably, Hall Mark is
the best of Heroic’s progeny to date.
Through the disqualification of his
original owners, Heroic could not start
in the Victoria Derby and Melbourne
Cup of 1924. Both races would have
been at his mercy.
Every winner on the opening day of
the V.R.C. spring meeting was ridden by
a Sydney jockey. Webster took the
Wakeful Stakes on Golden Hair and the
Hotham Handicap on Pretzel. Another
double —Melbourne Stakes and Derby
—-went to Darby Munro, while Bartle
collected the Maribyrnong Plate on
Pasha and J. O’Sullivan landed the Can-
tala Stakes on Care Free. Although
Webster hails from Maoriland, he has
spent a lot of time in Sydney.
That Pasha should have started at 20
to 1 in the Maribyrnong Plate is inex-
plicable. His credentials were excellent
—a win in the Canonbury Stakes at
Randwick and a win in a juvenile race
on Moonee Valley Gold Cup day. Pasha
had to be ridden right out to defeat the
favorite, Aztec, who was bred by H.
F. Creswick and is by Thracian (brother
to Heroic) from a Pendil mare that runs
back to the dam of the 1890 A.J.C.
Derby hero Gibraltar. Only a few days
before the race Aztec put up a sensa-
tional gallop at Caulfield. He probably
lost the Maribyrnong Plate through
greenness. Pasha, who cost 180 guineas
as a yearling, is trained by J. T. Jamie-
son for Mrs. M. Gearin. His sire, Ram-
pion, landed the Maribyrnong Plate of
1925, setting 59|- sec. for five furlongs,
which has remained a record for the
course.
Rogilla and Gaine Carrington had a
splendid set-to in the Melbourne Stakes.
Jim Pike tried to outgeneral Darby
Munro by taking Gaine Carrington to the
front and slowing down the field. The
two furlongs occupied 28sec. Munro
woke up to what was doing, and his
mount quickly joined the leader. Rogilla
and Gaine Carrington were together over
the last seven furlongs. They presented
a pretty spectacle. Pike sat motionless,
giving the impression that Gaine Car-
rington had something in hand at the
furlong post; but as soon as he
moved on the Caulfield Cup winner it
was obvious that Rogilla carried too
many guns. Rogilla scored brilliantly by
a neck.
The Cantala Stakes victory of Care
Free, Valicare’s daughter (10 to 1), drew
cheers from onlookers, who were cap-
tivated by the manner in which this little
mare shot through the field near home
and won by a length and a quarter in
the smart time of lmin. for a mile.
Minor places were filled by Whittingham
and Gordon’s Leap, both of whom are
trained by J. Holt. Backed down to 5
to 4, Dermid knocked up slightly after
the severe strain of overhauling L’Elite.
He just missed a place. Jack Donohue
believed Dermid to be unbeatable, but
the Tippler gelding was not quite at his
best on the day.
* * * *
Moorefield committee was pleased
with the attendance on Saturday and
bookmakers with the results, only one
favorite scoring. Architect Frank Moore
gave visitors a surprise. There is more
accommodation in the official stand,
where A.J.C. members are admitted, and
betting on the rails has been introduced.
The next move should be a new tote
house.
Randwick trainer William Kelso was
not present to see Buonarroti win the
Three-year-old in a walk from Veilantif
and Cabalist. The favorite, Gayhawk,
shaped poorly. Buonarroti eased in the
betting from sixes to fourteens, but paid
only £4 2s. on the paddock tote.
Dominion-owned After Money, who
carries the same colors as Safari, was
always at 6 to 4 for the Maiden Plate.
She moved up fast at the turn and
easily beat the pacemaker, Tommy Boy,
who started at 20 to 1, with Jonker
third. But after the favorite came the
outsider —Rossinver, a speedy-looking
colt by Rossendale from the Cooltrim
mare Leitrim, who outstayed the oppo-
sition in the Juvenile. He started at 15
to 1.
Bad riding brought about the defeat
of King Pin in the first division of the
Highweight. He and Bouyeo cut at
one another from the first furlong, and
they were left without a final run when
the Ascot-trained Prince Claro (9 to 2)
threw out a challenge. Accepted, the
favorite, was sore when doing his pre-
liminary, and could never get into a
winning position. The Moorefield-
trained Alantis, a stable-mate of the
Ascot-winner Rosario, narrowly beat
Arcturus in the second division. He was
backed from fifteens to tens.
Bad luck robbed Pantilla of the big
end of the prize in the Moorefield Handi-
cap. Her rider, S. Jones, went for a
run on the rails at the turn, but the
opening did not come. She was squeezed
back and, going on the outside at the
Leger, was beaten a head by the locally-
trained Journal (9 to 2), with Prowler
in the minor placing. Golden Flash was
favorite, but a hard race at Kensington
perhaps affected him ; anyway, he ran
poorly. The riders of Prowler and Pan-
tilla both entered protests against the
winner ; on Simpson being advised that
he had run third, he withdrew his par-
ticular objection.
Cowra Cup winner Poponaise (6 to 1),
owned by the western districts sports-
man Jot Hicks, and trained at Orange
by Wood, had to be ridden right out
to defeat Zeus in the Hurstville Mile,
with the favorite, Regal Star, a fair
third. Poponaise was one of the last to
leave the barrier, but he moved up fast
in the second furlong, and had the run
of the race from the half mile. Zeus
was unlucky to meet with interference
at a critical moment, and she should
soon enter the winning list for trainer
Rosenfeld, a Rugby footballer in the
days of Dally Messenger.

Sent to Brisbane for the Derby, Wai-
kare accomplished his task like a race-
horse. The local crack, Soft Step, was
favorite at 11 to 8 on ; but the Sydney
colt (4 to 1) downed him by half a length
in the good time of 2min. 33sec.;
Arboreal (8 to 1) was third. Tanwan,
Lough Neagh’s pilot, was on Waikare ;
he also rode Rivalli (2 to 1) to victory in
the Spring Stakes, Lady Linden being
second.
* * * *
After his inauspicious beginning, Win-
ooka is picking up races in the U.S.A.
Favorite for the Baltimore Handicap, he
won brilliantly by a length in fast time
—“six” in lmin. llsec. He is now to
show his paces in New York.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Jack Clarke, from New York, was too
strong and versatile for King Elliott at
Leichhardt on Saturday. At times the
Yank took things easy ; got holds, let
them go and then clamped on others.
Elliott’s flying tackles, followed by a
body press, gained him the first fall in
the third, but the American’s back-slam
in the fifth hurt Elliott so badly that he
couldn’t continue. Anyway, he didn’t.
Ins and Outs
Of the two Sheffield Shield matches
beginning last week-end, that between
Queensland and N.S.W., in Brisbane,
saw the home side well down by stumps
on Saturday. Scores then were: Q’land,
183 (Benstead 70, O’Reilly 6 for 58);
and N.S.W., 494 for four wickets (Brad-
man 200, Brown 154). Rain interrupted
the game on Monday.
South Australia and Victoria met in
Adelaide, Grimmett (7 for 80) routing
the visitors in the first innings for 197
(Woodfull 52, O’Brien 49). South Aus-
tralia answered with 228 (Nitschke 55,
Richardson 32). Fleetwood-Smith took
6 for 61. In Vic.’s second knock Pons-
ford (121) and Rigg (109) had 237 up for
no wickets by lunch on Monday.
* * * *
“Lansdowne”: Admittedly Australia
has produced and still produces more
left-hand batsmen of the highest quality
than England ; nevertheless, the latter
has had some notable ones besides
Spooner and Mead (B. 25/10/’33). The
first of them I can find recorded was
one “Felix” —his real name was hard to
spell and harder to pronounce —who
flourished alongside of the illustrious
Fuller Pilch in the comparatively Dark
Ages of cricket. Coming to modern
times there was Tom Emmett, the York-
shireman, who batted and bowled left-
handed and could make runs as well as
get wickets, though he came to excel
with the ball. C. L. Townsend, of Glou-
cestershire, made a name for himself
as one of the finest of all-rounders for a
few years about the close of last cen-
tury ; Altham ranks him as the greatest
of English left-hand batsmen. A little
sooner there was F. G. J. Ford, another
amateur, whom, I think, Australia saw
with one of Stoddart’s teams. Then
there was John Gunn, of Notts, who
sparkled out here in 1911-12 and was one
of the mainstays of his side. Finally
there is Frank Woolley, of Kent, that
model of batting grace and power who
has outlasted most of his early contem-
poraries. And this doesn’t exhaust the
list by any means.
(Continued on next page.)
The Rugby League Kangaroos had
three matches last week and lost two
of them. Bradford Northern was beaten
10-7, but the Northern League and
Swinton club prevailed over the tourists
by 7-5 and 10-5 respectively. Saturday
sees the second Test at Leeds.
* * * *
The N.S.W. champion fours, rowed on
the Nepean River, saw Sydney No. 1
crew, stroked by A. C. Lambert, win a
great race by three feet from Haberfield,
with Mosman third. The time for the
two miles was llmin. 54 3-ssec.
* * * • *
The inter-State tennis match between
N.S.W. and Victoria, in Sydney, saw
Ma win in the men’s section by 17
rubbers to 4. The visiting womenfolk
suffered even more severely, taking only
four sets against 12 rubbers by N.S.W.
The star turn was the Crawford-Hopman
singles. Hopman had shown fine form
in his other matches, but the champion
left him standing, 6-3, 6-1. With Mc-
Grath, Crawford defeated Hopman and
Tonkin in the doubles 6-4, 6-3.

Ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip”: Seems likely that the
team for England will be drawn largely
from the kindergarten class. Woodfull,
d „ a Aijc ij
Bradman, McCab and Oldfield, with,
perhaps. Wall, look the only certainties in
sight. Richardson cannot be considered,
and both Kippax and Ponsford will have
to show the selectors something out of
the box this season to be chosen. Kippax
did well with the last team in England,
coming third in the averages, while in
K Tests at home and a br° a d he has a ver-
aged 35.85 tor -1 knocks, but his form
last year was not impressive. This will
be his last chance, and everyone hopes
he will manage to take it. Ponsford
has been definitely in the ex-champion
class since the last tour of England and
will also have to show the touts a good
S ado P-
* . * . . * *
The most interesting item of the young
cricket season has been the selection of
the elevens to take part in the testimonial
matches in Melbourne and Sydney this
month. Woodfull and Victor Richardson
will lead the sides in Melbourne for the
Blackie-Ironmonger match beginning on
November 17, these being chosen by the
Victorian selectors. Nearly all the chosen
figured at one time or other in the Tests
last year, though there are exceptions like
Nitschke, Fleetwood-Smith and Oakley
on Woodfull’s side and Rigg, Nash and
Barnett on the other. Each has a couple
of left-handers and a fast bowler. Brad-
man is with Richardson, as are O’Reilly
and Grimmett. The beneficiaries both
figure with Woodfull’s lot. The N.S.W.
selection was simplified by making the
game N.S.W. v. The Rest. Ma retains
her Sheffield Shield choice, and the Rest,
with the exception of Walker and N.S.W.
slow-bowler Chilvers, are all in the
Victorian match, including the four left-
handers, Nitschke, Bromley, O’Brien and
Darling. Chilvers was a “hope” two sea-
sons back. He faded out and is for-
tunate to get this chance. The men have
,ho e u n g h d SZ,efa“d Nash once'abode m
W.A. and Tasmania. No Queenslander
has been considered.
* * * *
Some very good cricket annuals are
published in Australia ; the N.S.W.C.A.
annual has for some years been acknow-
ledged the best publication of its kind bar
“Wisden.” To Australian cricket-followers
it in some respects excels its English con-
temporary, for it gives details of the
Sheffield Shield contests as well as Test-
match and other cricket statistics. This
year’s edition is enlarged and has several
new features. One which should make
it particularly valuable is the story of
the bodyline controversy between Board
and M.C.C. The affair is set out with-
out prejudice, and the cables are given
in full. The volume is a credit to com-
piler Harold Heydon, and at the trifling
price of sixpence deserves to be a
best-seller.
“Glenelg”: That reference to Ernie
Jones (B. 1/11 /’33) reminds me that the
old-time fast bowler is in an Adelaide hos-
pital recovering from an operation. The
testimonial fund has caught on from the
jump, the S.A.C.A. throwing in £l5O and
setting aside the game between the State
and N.S.W. at Adelaide for his benefit.
The old warrior figured in a golden age
of Australian cricket, with players like
Darling, Hill, Noble, Trumper, Trumble,
Howell and others as contemporaries.
His first trip to England was in 1896, and
he went along with two subsequent
elevens. In Tests he took 60 wickets for
an average of 29.28, and in all first-
class games 604 at a cost of 22.56 runs
apiece. He was a really good hitter
when he felt like it and a magnificent
fieldsman at mid-off. He had a splendid
physique and could bowl at his top all
day.

The Nineteenth Hole
“Bumpkin”: Some £5OOO is to be dis-
tributed in prize-money for Melbourne’s
centenary golf frenzy. The open inter-
national championship will be held in
November, 1934, at the Metropolitan, at
Oakleigh, one of the most picturesque
links in Australia and the proud posses-
sor of a giant Westralian red-flowering
gum which is the object of an annual
pilgrimage. It is reckoned that this will
be the world’s richest golf tournament
and will attract leading pros, from every-
where. In addition, the committee will
invite four eminent British amateurs,
with the present British champion, Hon.
Michael Scott, as captain.
* * * *
“Claypan”: Golf has made mighty
strides in Queensland since the war, and
especially among the female of the
species. The annual report of the
Q.L.G.U. disclosed that in the last ten
years the clubs affiliated with that body
had jumped from three to 44, no fewer
than eight coming into the garden during
the past year. These clubs are not con-
fined to Brisbane, but have their abiding-
places all over the State, from the far
north to the wild and woolly west.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: The eighth Queensland
professional golf championship went to
A. E. Gazzard, the Victoria Park player,
who won from the titleholder, C. Brown,
of Goodna, by 2 and 1. Gazzard, though
well up as a rule, had never previously
won a major competition. In this instance
he was a marvel of consistency, averaging
4 for the 35 holes played in the final
round. Brown won this event the last
three years in succession, and in 1931-32
also held the State open championship.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: One of the features of the
past British golf season has been the
abandonment of plus-fours, once univer-
sally worn, by many male golfers. A
reason advanced is that they have of
late been rushed by the flapper players,
who have been turning out in some very
striking confections, which put the plain
white shorts of the tennis tabby to shame.
It wouldn’t be so bad even then if the
new craze was confined to the young
and slim. Many associates who are far
from being either have taken on the bi-
furcated garments, with terrifying results
in some instances.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Admission charges to golf
matches are becoming quite the usual
thing for major events. The P.G.A. of
N.S.W. has resolved to levy a fee of 2s.
to watch its professional championship
being played at La Perouse from Novem-
ber 14 to 18. For this the onlooker can
see the whole four days’ golf, and should
find it cheap at the price, since the Ma
State professional stars will be twinkling
in the endeavor to oust V. Richardson,
the holder of the title.
Racquet and Baw!
“Fr.”: They do these things better in
France. A friend has forwarded a copy
of a Paris journal entitled “Tennis and
Golf,” and its splurge over the victory of
the English team in the Davis Cup chal-
lenge round turns me green with envy.
“The triumph of the British team was
superb.... the ensemble is of a homo-
geneity. .. .the behavior under the placid
and jovial conduction of Roper Barrett
is worthy of instant commendation....
If we had succumbed before Lott’s bragga-
docio, Vines’s catapult and the preten-
tious ignorance of their leaders, we would
have surrendered to the hard law of war
with bitterness.... From the hands of
those whom Roper Barrett led so skil-
fully, we accept defeat with a smile of
resignation.” The inflated style of the
communique recalls that of one of the
Homers chronicling the story of the
Australian Rugby League team in Eng-
land. There is this difference, that the
Frenchmen seem to be able to take a
licking like sportsmen as opposed to
“sports.” •
* * * _ *
“Swan”: G. P. Hughes, captain of
the English tennis team, made his Aus-
tralian landfall well ahead of his mates.
He makes no bones about it that Craw-
ford is the greatest of to-day’s players.
He had also some things to say about
Quist and Turnbull as doubles players
which should make the ears of their
Australian critics burn.
* * * *
“Cottesloe”: Westralia has chosen its
tennis team for the invitation tour of
India and Ceylon. The side, which will
leave Perth on November 27 and open
in the All India championships at Cal-
cutta on December 20, consists of R.
D. Ford, H. Jacoby, W. Stephen and C.
B. Davis. Ford is first on the State
ranking list, and Jacoby second. Davis,
a good doubles player, is No. 6, and
Stephen, at 18, holds the State junior
title. After the Calcutta fixture the team
will play in Madras and Ceylon, re-
turning in January. It is hoped that next
year a team from India will return the
visit.
* * * *
“Hotham”: The Australian tennis
overlords in Melbourne have decided to
shove off the question of sending a team
abroad for the next Davis Cup until some
other time, which is in complete accord-
ance with their manana attitude towards
things in general. However, they kept
awake long enough to pick a selection
committee, “in case,” and this is com-
posed of Brookes, Clemenger, Frank
Peach and Malcolm. Australian players
taking part in the Tests against the
Britons will pull down two quid a day
while away from their abiding city. Out
of that they will have to find Iheir own
housing, though travelling expenses will,
of course, be paid for them. The Eng-
landers, with all costs met, will pouch
15s. a day allowance. This goes back to
the day of their leaving ’Frisco and will
continue until they are shooed off at Perth.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: There is little
likelihood that the English tennis-players
will be asked to shove into matches out-
side the programme arranged (B.
l/11/’33). The original agreement was
that the visitors would take part only in
the Tests against Australia and in the
“What’s your handicap?”
“My golf.”
Australian championships, which begin
in Sydney on January 20. Victoria is
keen on having the Englishmen showing
in the Cabbage Garden State events,
which open on November 17, and has
issued a special invitation. Acceptance
is unlikely.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Cobb lowered a couple of
world’s motor records at Brooklands last
week, driving his new Railton-designed
car. Both were standing start events, and
in the kilometre Cobb hit up 88.14 m.p.h.
The previous best was 86.90 by Parry
Thomas in 1926, a few days before he
was killed. Cobb’s second fly was at the
mile, and here he hoisted 102.52 m.p.h.,
close on two miles better than Kaye
Don’s best. Crossing the “humpback”
bridge on the course at 140 m.p.h. the
car left the track in a jump of 50ft. It
landed again with a tremendous crash,
Cobb avoiding disaster by a miracle.
*** * .
“Pram”: G. E. Eyston, the English
driver who specialises in small-car records,
broke out in a new place at Brooklands
the other day. He hoisted fresh figures
for a Diesel-engined car over a kilometre,
averaging 106.64 m.p.h. He also covered
a flying mile at 104.86 m.p.h. As, owing
to the weather conditions, he was using
ordinary tyres, it is estimated he could
have bettered his performance by several
m.p.h. with a racing set on. In any case
he beat American Cummins’s record of
100.75 m.p.h. made at Daytona two years
ago.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: Australian motor-
cyclists stopped one in the eye last week
when a cable came through from the
British Speedway Control Board to say
that an official team would not be dis-
patched to Australia. The cable adds
that this action is due to the delay of
the folk at the Australian end in supply-
ing important information necessary be-
fore arrangements for the tour could be
made. Following on the trouble between
the two bodies last year it is evident that
a bodyline situation has been created.
Nevertheless, since many Australian
cracks are returning from Britain for the
season here accompanied by a number of
the leading English riders, there should
be plenty doing in the game.
“Differential”: According to a re-
turned traveller, motor-car racing on dirt
tracks is developing into a craze in U.S.A.
Many of the tracks are small, but casual-
ties are not as frequent as might be ex-
pected. On the other hand, save for the
Indianapolis 500, track-racing and speed-
recording are comparatively rare in Uncle
Samland, while the road contests which
take up so much attention in Europe and
in a smaller degree in Australia are un-
known.
* * * *
“Bumpk”: Ossie Nicholson, who burst
through a paper screen in Melbourne’s
Elizabeth-street in the manner of the
circus horseback lady, thus symbolised
his fracture of the world’s 12 months’
cycling record after only ten months’
riding. This was held by Englishman
Humbles, who covered 30,694 miles in
the same period, his full total being
36,007 miles. Nicholson has ridden
36,025 miles on the road since Jan. 1, and
is carrying on. He has pushed his bike
over most of the highways of the State,
with excursions into N.S.W., though his
pet beat was the smooth, flat track
between Melbourne and Sorrento
Nicholson’s highest daily mileage was
175.
Miscellaneous
“Bias”: The everlasting wrangle over
the payment of travelling expenses to
touring bowling teams rages again in
N.S.W. A wrong-headed but persistent
section insists that to do this would make
the players professionals. The world’s
games and athletic organisations, includ-
ing the Olympic Federation, are flatly
opposed to the diehards on this question.
If these people are right then the Rugby
Union Wallabies, that splendid band of
young Australians who earned golden
opinions throughout South Africa by
their conduct on and off the playing field,
are professionals of the deepest dye,
which, as an old friend of our youth
used to put it, “is absurd.”
* * * *
“Blue Chalk”: When, at the end of
the last billiards season in England,
Walter Lindrum opposed the action of
the authorities in permanently adopting
the baulkline rule for championship
matches, he said he would never play
under it again. The English players, with
an eye on their bread-and-butter, lay
low, but are now showing signs of revolt.
Joe Davis and Willie Smith have both
declared they will follow Lind rum’s lead,
and as they are still about the best Eng-
lish pair they will have to be listened to.
Both agree with Lindrum that the rule
hinders scientific play and makes the
game less spectacular. The Billiards
Association retorts that something must
be done to check the immense scores
initiated by Lindrum.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Austin Robertson
says that the job of an amateur
athlete in America is one of the most
lucrative imaginable. If he is a really
good man he not only gets cash payments
but has everything found for him free,
including a university education if he
wants it, and after that a nominal job
with a screw out of all proportion. It
sounds all right, and is so while the
athlete lasts. When his powers fail him
he invariably goes into the discard, and
not only in America, as many a disillu-
sioned popular hero has found out. •
* * * *
“Shell”: Though attempts are being
made to bring Bob Pearce to Australia
to defend his title they are doomed to
failure, for the time being at least. The
Australian has several engagements
booked on the other side, one being
against Major Goodsell. At the same time,
the American amateur champion, Miller,
who was second to Bob at the last Olym-
pic Games, will row Englishman Phelps,
the respective winners meeting in the
final. Miller’s decision to join the pro-
fessional ranks is interesting, since Bob
rates him as the best amateur he has met.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 12.
Going Round at Goodna.
Goodna is one of the most successful
of the younger Queensland golf clubs. It
was founded in 1924 by Dr. H. B. Eller-
ton, head of the great mental hospital
close by, and a few equally enthusiastic
friends. These folk also were respon-
sible for the layout of the course and its
development to championship standard.
A ...
Much of the work on the links
was done in the early days by working-
bees of members and the original club-
house was erected in the same fashion
with the help °f a professional builder.
The south-western railway and main
road run close by the clubhouse which
has been enlarged and improved. The
course is full championship length-6600
yards and_is splendidly grassed and well
supplied with water. There are no blind
greens, all being visible from the aver-
foT > u )aC f lln ®’ 7 ne 7 f
the 102 bunkers is a hidden trap for the
unwary. Nor does any of the 18 holes
look into the declining afternoon
sun. There are 250 members and 150
associates.
Swinging first into the picture in regu-
lar Guardee fashion is G. Powell. A
middle-mark player, he is a picture-show
proprietor off the links and Gilbert
Roland couldn’t show him any points
about a marcelled coiffure. Second we
have W. Hynd, connected with coal-
mining when not taking out divots. The
fact that his handicap is 5 and that he
is in the A pennant team makes it almost
superfluous to add that he is a Scot,
Benign and beaming follows Dr. H. B.
Ellerton, captain as well as founder. It
is alleged by detractors that none of the
club’s bunkers, plotted by himself, is
within reach of his own tee shots.
The comfortable-looking citizen in
fourth place is W. J. Payton. He
was the first hon. treasurer, and gath-
ered in the shekels so successfullee that
they made him life member of the
G.G.C. when he retired. He is on the
staff of the mental hospital.
J. M. Neill is next. Playing off
scratch, he has come to be regarded as
permanent club champion, for he has
taken the title for four successive years.
He learned all about niblicks at Goodna,
and still uses the set of clubs he
began with. He naturally leads the A
pennant team. The willowy person of
Bunthorne-ish aspect who is numbered
sixth is C. W. Russell, a long but not
always accurate hitter. Still, he can
command a 7 handicap and is a member
of the A team. One of the club’s many
Diggers. Off the fairway, is in the
carrying business. The delighted smile
that comes next is attached to R. Halli-
day. He is vice-captain and is manager
in Queensland for Leyland motors.
Eighth is C. L. Thompson, whom we
have met before in the Brisbane G. C.
gallery. One of Queensland’s best
players and in the A team.
At No. 9 behold Dr. W. F. Jackes.
He plays a fairish game off a 15/11
handicap, and the ribald assert that
his profession of dentist is respon-
sible for his tendency to pull his shots.
Following him is the unmistakable
Digger dial of L. R. Woods, the club’s
hon. sec. and tale-teller in ordinary.
Once a footballer and boxer of note,
and looks it. On 11, Frith presents,
pipe in mouth, as ever, G. H. Burrows,
who boasts a 11/8 handicap. He is an
engineer on the staff of the hospital
and has been responsible for the reticu-
lation of the club’s fairways. After him
comes J. L. Austin, a 10-marker. An
ex-naval man, he made a name in navy
boxing, though you would not think so
to look at him. When not golfing, he
is with the Wakefield Castrol people.
The lucky thirteen has been drawn by
L. Watmough, a 16/12-mark player,
whose delighted expression suggests that
his opponent has been hopelessly bun-
kered. He is a departmental manager
in Hoffnung’s, and a Digger. Four-
teenth is A. Broadbent, one of the club’s
best-liked personalities, but no Sarazen.
He runs a big carrying business. He of
the sad, sweet smile who is the next to
be pilloried is A. T. Graham, a very
long driver with a 13/10 handicap. He
has won several open events and tied for
the A.I.F. Cup this year.
The lad with the Baldwin pipe, No.
16, is Dr. A. D. Buchanan, a good per-
former off 8/6. He is a committeeman
and member of the A team, with a wide
experience of golf overseas. He is a
returned soldier. B. C. Percy, next in
order, has been a committeeman for
most of the club’s existence. He is Bris-
bane manager for Lawrence and Han-
son, the electrical goods people, and finds
trouble in deciding whether golf or fish-
ing is his real lifework. C. H. Huston
is No. 18. He has not yet been allotted
a handicap. When not at Goodna he
is connected with the Brisbane abattoirs.
G. W. Sims stands on 19. A com-
mitteeman for years, he is a building con-
tractor and has had a hand in most of
the additions to the clubhouse. He is
more than a useful golfer with a 9/7
handicap, and has played the game in
Britain. At 20 is I. Constance, who is
a stylist both in golf and attire. A 2/2
handicap man, he is a member of the A
team, and is the best match player in
the club. As a stroker, he has the club
record of 72. Twenty-one, as you might
guess, has Paddy for his first name, the
other being Meaney. He is a commit-
teeman and a sound performer with the
A team. Secretary of the Central Tech.,
he had,the lads and lasses attending the
classes taught golf as part of the curri-
culum.
Hope gleams high in the eye of
C. Brown, who comes next. He is the
club professional and for three conse-
cutive years, until he was beaten in the
final the other day, the professional
champion of the State, in addition to
winning the open on a couple of occa-
sions.
Another Brown —C.G.—follows his
namesake. This one is honorary treas-
urer, and it is alleged that since he took
over the job he plays left-handed so as to
keep the right on the cash. He is a
postal official, and was a good amateur
boxer in his youth.
No. 24 is E. Wolfe, who plays off the
13/10 mark. He is a poultry-farmer,
but dismisses as a felon untruth the
allegation that he always calls out
“Chook, chook” instead of “fore” when
driving off. No. 25 is O. Stanley,
assistant professional. A youngster of
great promise who has been shaking up
some of the oldsters in recent profes-
sional competitions. He is followed by
J. Wildhaber, a committeeman and en-
joyer of a 7/5 handicap. A sound
player who won last year’s Anzac Cup.
Out of golf he is a Vacuum Oil employee
A. Powell, senior, is a picture-theatre
proprietor in Brisbane, and A. Powell,
junior, is a new hand training under the
eye of his dad. John Chambers is a re-
tired G.M. of Queensland’s railways and
daily plays a regular 18 holes with a
couple of cronies. Another ex-railway-
man is R. A. Neild, formerly mechani-
cal engineer, who is one of the cronies
aforesaid. He has achieved merit of late
by holing in one. The third of the
trio and depicted as the last of the
Graces is G. W. Thom, also a retired
engineer, but, in this case, from the Water
and Sewerage Board. Tailing up the •
procession comes H. C. Russell, who is
manager of the Wide Bay Dairy Co. He
is a noted long driver and is said to
practise getting them off the tee early
every morning on the old farm, using
the eggs left over for golf balls.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE CHAIN SYSTEM.
“Lion”: The chain system for slaugh-
tering sheep, in general use in the Argen-
tine and Maoriland, could be introduced
with advantage into N.S.W. Victoria
has found that it works successfully,
a team of 27 men killing 2000 sheep in
1\ hours. The advantages are:
(1) A better dressed carcass.
(2) More comfort for the men, as they work
in an upright position all the time.
(3) Amateurs could quickly become proficient
in their particular parts of the operation,
whereas they might never make fast killers on
their own.
The system is worked in 20 opera-
tions by 27 men, as many as three men
assisting in one operation in order to get
their job finished before the chain has
moved its distance to the next man or
men. It moves 12ft. a minute, during
which time each man or group works
until the sheep is a finally washed,
trimmed and wiped carcass.
The greatest advantage of all is No.
3. In recent years, right in the middle
of the export lamb season, Sydney
slaughtermen have declared a strike, with
serious results to the trade, themselves
and the producers. Overseas orders have
not been fulfilled, and the trade has re-
peatedly suffered from lack of confi-
dence. The lambs were here, but the car-
casses couldn’t be shipped.
MITCHELL GRASS.
“Ripe Corn”: When Mitchell grass (B.
4/10/’33) misses one wet season on the
black soil of north-west Queensland the
roots, as well as the grass, die. New
grass must grow from seed. All grasses
and some herbage, like carrots and white
daisies, need rain at the right time to
produce germination on a wide scale.
From 1926 to 1933 only isolated early-
summer rain fell in north-west Queens-
land. So no body of Mitchell grass grew.
With heavy rains from Nov. to Jan. the
downs will grow Mitchell grass again,
though it will take several regular sea-
sons to stool up to its old body. January-
to-March rain is ideal for Flinders grass.
Carrots will not grow without winter
rains. West Queensland was like a
ploughed field during the last drought.
When over 4in. rain fell in the winter of
1932 the growth of carrots and white
daisies could have been machine-mowed.
Yet this seed lay in that bare ground for
12 years since the last winter rain. The
same applies to Mitchell grass.
PASTURING THE SUCKING-PIGS.
“Hatter”: All young animals need
exercise. Overseas experiments have
proved it wise to let a sow and her litter
go out to grass at will. In every case
the piglings confined to the sties made
less progress '‘after the first month than
the litters that were allowed to roam.
The roamers ate and developed healthy
appetites at a month old. The indoor
litters did not eat till five or six weeks
old, and their appetites were poor. In
some cases anaemia was diagnosed. The
roamers made more rapid growth, and
at six weeks old the average weight
showed an increase of 2j\b. a head over
the indoor group. At nine weeks their
selling value was reckoned at 10s. per
head more than the indoors, owing to
their greater weight and bloom.
Watch young pastured stock for para-
sitic worms, which in small runs may
cause serious losses. Do not allow young
pigs to run on ground previously stocked
with pigs.
WHEAT-POISONING.
“W.J.”: Farmers using horses must
see that the animals do not touch a
wheat-bag. There has been debate about
the effect of dry wheat on a horse, but
the point was cleared up at Melbourne
University veterinary college. Two old
crocks were drenched and starved for
24 hours. One then was given a good
gorge of dry wheat, and died. Post-
mortem revealed clearish liquid in the
stomach. It contained a strong acid
poison, which could be neutralised by an
alkali; e.g„ soda or ammonia.
The second horse was given a dose
from his comrade’s stomach, and died
'with all the symptoms shown by the first
animal. Two other crocks were given
the drench-and-starvation treatment;
then one was given dry wheat, and the
other some of the poisonous stomach
liquid. As soon as they showed symp-
toms they were given ilb. of soda bicarb
in a pint of water. Both recovered.
This simple remedy has never failed in
Victoria.
COLIC AND GRIPES.
“W. Tas.”: It is not easy even for an
experienced horseman to distinguish
between gripes and colic in a horse. The
treatments are basicly different. If the
horse’s flanks are distended, and he rolls
about, without any breaks or violent
action, he windy colic. If there is no
distension but intermittent pain, and the
horse rolls about kicking, it is gripes.
The prescription for windy colic is ioz.
to loz. of oil of turps, i-oz. liquid
ammonia and loz. sulphate of iron in
a pint of water.
Whisky is good for gripes. Follow it
with 3 drams of carbonate of ammonia
with ioz. of laudanum in water, and the
horse will sleep. He will wake up ready
for work. The use of the syringe with
plenty of warm soapy water helps. An
ounce of turps mixed with a pint of raw
linseed oil will relieve worms.
WHEAT GRASS.
“Mulyan”: Australian wheat grass is
a nutritious pasture plant which responds
well to cultivation. It is also known as
blue wheat grass. The names are de-
rived from the blue tinge in the leaf and
the plant’s relation to cultivated wheat.
The grass is in all States, but is found
mostly in coastal regions and on the
tablelands. It grows to sft. high, accord-
ing to soil and situation. Its special
value, particularly on dairy farms, is that
it grows all the year, producing an
abundance of succulent herbage when
most other grasses are dead or drying
off. It is excellent feed. All kinds of
stock thrive on it.
Under cultivation the grass can be cut
for green feed. When cut in the early-
flowering stage it makes good hay. It is
easily propagated from seed, of which it
bears a considerable quantity. In good
soils it produces a heavy crop of fatten-
ing forage. But in the pasture, stock
prevent it from seeding freely, and its
spread is checked. Though perennial, it
can be eaten out by constant grazing.
Therefore have a cultivation plot for
production of seed. This is a good plan
for the perpetuation of all high-class
native grasses. The wheat grass is one
of the best for rotational grazing because
of the green feed it provides in winter.
POISONING TREES.
“Wrash”: To readily kill trees or
suckering stumps, a surer method than
ringbarking is to poison them. Dissolve
in water 31b. of washing soda and add
slowly and thoroughly lib. of arsenic.
Boil the mixture, but stand clear. The
fumes are poisonous. Add water to
make up 4gal. A quart, or less, suffices
to destroy a fair-sized tree.
Ring the trees low down with a frill,
and cut deeply into the wood. Fill the
frill with the poison, and in a week the
tree will be dead or dying. The right
time for poisoning is when the sap is
down.
LIMING LAND.
“S.D.C.”: “Thorley” (B. 27/9/’33)
mentions lime at £2 a ton, which is much
nearer the mark than “B. Ware’s” price
—l2s. 6d. It requires 16 bags at 6s. each
to hold a ton of lime “airslaked.” This
leaves only 4s. 6d. on “B. Ware’s” price
to produce a ton of lime.
The liming of land is mostly guess-
work. Users should get instructions on
the subject from agricultural experts.
Costs make the use of lime on large
areas impracticable, but that lime is a
direct help to some plants is obvious.
Lucerne shows immediate results. “Thor-
ley” refers to lime being used in quanti-
ties of a few pounds per acre. Experts
say that less than scwt. is no use at all,
one ton being nearer right. The type of
soil determines the amount needed.
CARE OF THE SEPARATOR.
“Rotom”: A faulty separator means
considerable loss to a dairy-farmer.
Periodical Babcock tests of the skim-
milk will reveal any appreciable cream
drainage.
To separators, lubricating oil is fed by
the splash system. Use only the best
light-bodied oils. Keep the oil pipes un-
choked, and twice a year drain the
machine and. flush out its bearings with
kerosene.
The bowl bearings, after a period of
service, tend to wear down and lower the
bowl. Occasionally look to the adjust-
ments and keep the bowl at its proper
level. Have an instruction book in the
dairy and use it frequently.
SINKING A WELL.
“W.D.M.”: “Bill R.” (B. 11 /10/’33) is
out of date in his methods. A much
better plan is to get concrete pipes of the
required diameter, place one on the
selected site and commence sinking on
the inside. Let the pipe into the ground
gradually. When it is level with the sur-
face, place another pipe on top, cemqnt
the joint and then proceed to sink as
before. Continue the process till finished.
It will be a job that will not need renewal.
JAPANESE MILLET.
“Hall Mint”; Japanese millet stands
up well to the Australian summer. It is the
quickest germinator and grower among
the millets and gives abundance of green
feed. It stands either grazing or mow-
ing, and will stool out well and come
again during autumn. You can now get
from two to three cuts of hay before it
gets too dry the first time. The hay is
firm, leafy and easily cured, making a
very sweet chaff and containing a great
deal of oily grain when allowed to seed.
It is almost rodent-proof and rain-proof
—a good stack top. It can be fed with
safety, wet or dry, to all classes of stock.
If you want it to come again do not let
the stock eat it too close. A rough har-
rowing or spring toothing will hasten
growth. Store pigs like the highly-
nutritious root clump.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Tenrag”: Lucerne used just before
flowering is one of the best green foods
for poultry. Its high organic calcium
content makes shell and bone. It also
helps to prevent watery whites and dead-
in-shell.
“Hatter”: Dehorn calves at two days
old. Clip the hair about one inch round
the “button.” Smear grease or vaseline
thickly around the edge to stop caustic
running into the eyes. Lay the calf on
its side with the head firmly held on the
ground, and rub the stick of caustic on
the skin till hair is removed. Do not
cause bleeding or let the calves out in
the rain for a day or two.
“Bill R.”: When a loaded waggon is
bogged, do not waste time and energy
trying to haul it forward. Bring the
team round and draw backwards on to
sound ground. If it still refuses to move
hook long chains to upward and forward
extending spokes of the bogged wheels.
By hauling on them the waggon will
come a foot or two each pull.
“Firefighter”: Provide all paddocks
with two exits if your country is subject
to fire. Keep the gates and sliprails
painted white ; it enables helpers to spot
the getaway quickly. One western N.S.W.
run has openings in the wire fences with
looped wire-ends, fastened with pins of
wire. All one has to do is pull the pin
and fold the ends back to the posts.
These gadgets do not hinder straining,
are easily undone, and are marked with
a long sapling tied to each side post.
“Chook”: A firm of W.A. egg-ex-
porters is organising poultry-farmers’
supplies on a co-operative basis. With
250 members, all feed, kerosene and
medicines are to be purchased wholesale
and supplied at bare handling charges,
thus increasing poultry farmers’ present
profits while preparing to meet any pos-
sible slump in overseas prices. Member-
ship is to cost nothing, the only proviso
being that the firm must have the hand-
ling of all exportable eggs.
“The Breaker”: At Toowoomba (Q.)
recently all heavy horses yarded, except
three, were sold at public auction, geld-
ings bringing up to £33 and mares to
£42. Ponies are coming back into favor ;
they sold up to £l6. With the increased
Indian demand for Walers, the future is
bright, and prices should hold for all
quality animals.
“Meatpreserver”: Worm nodules (On-
chocerca gibsoni), usually found in the
brisket and near the stifle, cause great
loss to our meat-export trade. The
nodule varies in size, from a pea to a
small orange. It is a tough capsule in
clear fluid —a long, threadlike worm, so
coiled up as to be impossible to dissect.
The worm is about 40in. long, has a dis-
tinct mouth and digestive and sexual
organs. The female contains numerous
eggs and embryos in various stages of
development. The British authorities
object to the presence of the nodule in
beef, hence the ban on briskets and the
need for stifling hindquarters. Veterinary
authorities cannot account for the
method of entry of the parasite to its
host. It is confined entirely to this coun-
try, occurring chiefly in Queensland-bred
cattle and frequently in N.S.W. beef.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Can you tell me a cheap way to prevent
water turning green in large, open-top galvan-
ised-iron tanks used for watering stock, or ex-
cavated-earth stock tanks ? —8264.
The green color is caused by the growth
of minute plants— algce. These do not grow
much without sunlight. To stop their growth,
place a light-proof cover on the tank. If
you cannot do this, add bluestone (copper
sulph.) to the water —30 grains per 1000 gallons.
Price of rabbitskins in N. S. Wales ? —8642.
Present N. S. Wales lots average from Bd. to
lOd. per pound. Future prices cannot be fore-
cast.
(1) What are the prospects of the chilled-beef
trade between Australia and England ? Will you
tell me about the methods of chilling, shipping,
selling and the organisation of the market on
the English side ? (2) Is N.S.W. country killing
doomed in view of the proposed increase in the
meat inspection fees ? —8646.
(1) An experimental shipment of chilled beef
was sent in the s.s. Port Fairy last year. Since
then three marketable shipments have been
landed in London, and the last one greatly
impressed the trade; two others are on the
water. There is every reason to believe that
Australia can distribute in England chilled beef
instead of frozen, which is essential if it is to
remain in the beef-export trade. The methods
used by the company in the treatment of chilled
beef are the same as those employed in the
Argentine. On board steamer, the beef must
hang and not be stacked. The Australian Chill-
ing and Freezing Co., Ltd., adopts the same
selling and organisation methods as Argentine
shippers, viz., selling on the hook at market
price of the day, according to quality, weight
and condition. Early-matured beef and con-
tinuity of supplies are essential to export suc-
cess. Regular shipments are necessary, and
there is every reason to believe that the ship-
ping companies will give a service. At present
shippers are greatly handicapped by the high
rate of freight, which is more than double that
from the Argentine and South Africa. The
South African Government, to encourage chilled-
beef shipments, pays a bounty of 4d. per pound
on grass-fed cattle suitable for “chillers,” and
id. if they are hand-fed. (2) Those concerned
say that the proposed additional inspection
charges must be passed on to the primary pro-
ducers or the country works must close. They
declare that fees should be reduced and not in-
creased.
What kind of saltbush would grow best in
Tasmania, and where may the seed be obtained ?
—8534.
The seed of old-man saltbush (A triplex num-
mularia) and creeping saltbush ( Atriplex semi-
baccata) can be bought from Arthur Yates, Ltd.
The latter may be worth a trial in the Hamil-
ton district, but other plants will prove more
profitable.

capable of producing ? (2) If this flow were
harnessed direct at the bore-mouth would it
affect output ? (3) What would be the probable
yearly depreciation ? —8637.
(1) No dynamic tests yet made. We cannot
give exact h.p., but it would, compared with
other artesian bores actually tested, be about
40 h.p. (2) The.flow is now being connected
direct to a reticulation system. This will have
a tendency to conserve the flow, as a back
pressure will develop. (3) It is expected that
the yearly diminution will not exceed 1 p.c.
If the water flowed unrestrictedly, the diminu-
tion would be greater than 1 p.c. per annum.
How can I best use wood ashes, stacked for
a number of years, in the garden ? What is the
best class of lime to use, and when is the best
time to use it ? —B6OO.
Wood ashes for long exposed to rain lose
most of their manure value. Apply lime to
the soil in form of quicklime, slaked lime and
agricultural lime. The first two are best on
very clayey or acid soils, and agricultural lime
on other classes of soil. Agricultural lime is
the safest, but it must be in a very fine state of
division. The quantity used depends upon soil,
and may range from lOcwt. to one ton per acre.
Ten cwt. per acre equals 3|oz. per sq. yard.
(1) Is there any demand in Sydney for
chopped wattle-bark ? What is the price and
who are the agents ? (2) Is there any other
way of marketing instead of chopping ? (3)
Please explain fully the method for chopping,
size, drying, marketing and bagging. (4) Strip-
ping.—B677.
(1) Chopped wattle-bark is sold in Sydney by
the Farmers and Graziers’ Co-op. Grain, In-
surance and Agency Co., Ltd., Circular Quay;
Pitt, Son and Badgery, 40 O’Connell-street;
Craig, Mostyn and Co., 29 Reiby-place. (2)
Supply it in the stick form, in which it is
taken from the tree and dried before chopping.
It would be necessary to rail the bark direct
from producer to user, and in this direction
three tanners at Kingswood and one at St.
Mary’s would be the only outlets._ (3) After
the stick-bark has been properly dried, so that
when broken it throws dust, chop it in pieces
(either with an axe or chaff-cutter) about 2in.
to 4in. long. Use either three or four bushel
bags, and, with a view to saving bags, ram
the bark in each bag. Make arrangements with
one of the three sellers mentioned in answer (1).
(4) The bark is stripped when the sap is up the
tree, generally from about October 1 to end ot
April. If the bark does not leave the tree
freely, do not strip, or the quality will suffer.
After stripping, let bark dry by standing the
strips around the butt of the tree for two days,
provided the weather is dry enough. Then put
it into bundles of 401 b. to 501 b., and stand these
up against the butt for a fortnight or three
weeks. Then gather the bundles and stack them
under cover so that the air can go right through
them for at least a month.
“Pine Scrub”: In the Wimmera (Vic.)
district the horses suffer in the spring
from an itch on the legs, so irritating that
they rub themselves raw on the fences. A
local farmer has built a concrete dip
wide enough to walk a horse through
and deep enough to immerse it half-wa)
up the body. He uses a proprietary fluid
dip, double sheep-dipping strength, and
has had such good results that he now
dips annually over 300 head for sur-
rounding farmers. He also uses the dip
for sheep, having a sheep-race running
alongside the horse-race and a side-
delivery chute.

Wheat and Waiting
Current reports show that it is still
impossible to estimate the wheat harvest
accurately. The best authorities in South
Australia say estimation there is guess-
work. Weather variations even at reap-
ing point are apt to alter the S.A.
yield by millions of bushels. In N. S.
Wales, districts around Lake Cargellico,
Rankin Springs, Ungarie and other
places in the south are pretty bad—
worse in some than in others. In spots a
third of the crops have failed. Further
north, frost, hot, windy weather, stem-
rust and other vicissitudes have played
their part. As the total area under crop
this year in N.S.W. shows a falling off
of 250,000 acres the result may be salu-
tary in keeping the export yield within
quota limits. In Queensland the whole
crop will not be a record, but districts
like Clifton, Elphinstone, Nobby and
Allora expect to make much bigger
deliveries than in 1932-33.
* * * *
The past week has not been marked
by further developments in Canberra.
Even the threat of the Wheatgrowers’
Federation to boycott the wheat market
unless the Government announces some
definite form of assistance to the industry
has failed to spur Mr. Lyons and Mr.
Stewart to definite action. Mr. Stewart,
it is believed, is reluctant because he is
personally opposed to Government assist-
ance to industry. Mr. Lyons, on the
other hand, is anxious to do something,
but he is facing pressure from all sides.
* * * *
The scheme which the Government is
said to favor is a sales tax on flour of
£6 per ton or thereabouts. Official cal-
culations are that this would enable the
lifting of the local price to growers to 4s.
6d. per bushel, equivalent to a subsidy
of 6s. per acre over Australia, while in-
creasing the price of the 21b. loaf
The Master Bakers, however, say that
the change would put the price of flour
up and add Id. to the loaf.
* * * *
It seems certain that any measure the
Government takes must put up the price
of flour, because its objective must be
to increase the price of grain. To apply
the burden through the loaf is the fairest
means of distributing it over the whole
community and the one which will be
least felt. Millers and bakers will be
helped to some extent in N. S. Wales by
the decision of the State authorities to
forego their flour tax after December —
which will give the Commonwealth a
£400,000 p.a. State margin to work on.
* * * *
Queensland opposes the flour tax.
Labor members there have few wheat
constituents, so that the bread consumer
is their more immediate concern. Bul-
cock, Minister for Agriculture, says the
suggestion of a tax is “disquieting.” In
W.A. a plan is being pushed for the for-
mation of a Rural Credits Bank, which
the Commonwealth would finance to the
tune of £7,200,000. This would be raised
by a note issue based on the security of
32,000,000 bushels of home-consumption
wheat, of which the price would be
fixed at 4s. 6d. The money would
be distributed to the States on an
acreage basis. But the flour-tax scheme
is the better one. It will make a clean
job of the business, leaving no hangover,
recurrent interest liability or temptation
to a lot of civil servants to keep in exist-
ence for ever something which should
be a severely temporary expedient.
* * * *
Oversea markets have eased slightly
during the week, but prices remain steady
in Australia—ls. lOd. in bulk, Is. lid.
bags at sidings in N. S. Wales. Little
trade is being done. The export-flour
market is dull as ditchwater. Everybody
is waiting for something to happen, and
sellers are reluctant to deal lest they
should miss the good things which may
come to them in a week or two when
the Premiers’ Conference has threshed
the wheat position out and decided what
is to be done.
* * * *
The unstabilised position caused by
the adoption of the Gold Plan in U.S.A.
is affecting overseas business, as is also
the fear of Russian wheat competition,
there being no even approximately re-
liable estimate of that country’s probable
output. Its shipments have become
heavier during the last fortnight. Dur-
ing last week 15,950 tons of Australian
wheat was sold in London, the best
price being 2s. ll|d. sterling for a 1000-
ton parcel quitted on October 31 for
December shipment.
Cost Per Acre
“The Chiel”: Provided their costs are
equal the farmer who averages 20 bushels
of wheat per acre can afford to take a
much lower price than one who averages
10 bushels. But wide variations occur.
One man handles his wheat in bulk, an-
other in bag ; one may be two miles from
the railway and the other 20 ; one may
have paid £lO per acre for his land, the
other £5. The cost of land enters largely
into costs.
* * * *
At Lang’s 1931 Bathurst Conference
the wheat committee, working on a 12-
bushel average from 400 acres, fixed pro-
duction cost per bushel at 4s. Of
this, Is. 9d. was interest. Land value was
placed at £6 10s. per acre. Some farmers
may have paid it, but how can land pro-
ducing 12 bushels per acre be worth
£6 10s.?
* * * *
Two outstanding needs in the wheat
crisis are an increased average-per-acre
yield and a readjustment of land values
on the basis of a profitable return to the
producer from a fair average yield per
acre at world’s parity prices. It is futile
to fix a price for wheat based on costs
of production which are calculated on
a low average yield and high land values.
The former is a subsidy to lax farming ;
the latter a subsidy to stupidity.
Fall in Butter Goes On
“8.5.”: London butter values are still
falling. Within six weeks Australian has
dropped 23 s. a cwt. to the figure for
the first week of June. The A.D.E.
Board has reduced its minimum c.i.f.
and e. price by 75.; it’s still that
amount above what J. Bull considers
a fair price. There may be some plain
talk at the board’s Melbourne meeting
this week regarding the method of fixing
forward prices. Many members realise
that prices fixed lately have been suici-
dal—a present of the business to M.L.
competitors. A brake may be applied,
but against this is the weight of those
who wish to abolish forward sales alto-
together. Large factories were persuaded
to leave forward selling and to consign.
To-day’s prices have caused directors to
consider whether the tipping of market
prospects is not the same as picking
doubles. It is difficult to see how the
board can actually prohibit forward sales.
Under its charter—the Dairy Produce
Export Control Act —special representa-
tion on the board is given to forward
sellers.
* * *
The prohibition of forward sales would
make for easy business; consigning
would not require any selling ability.
Forward sales entail a close knowledge
of market trends. Sponsors of prohibition
aim at limitation of London agents. This
would enable the board to exercise a
measure of control in London which
under existing conditions is impossible.
While the proposal may allure some, it is
certain that a large number of present
handlers would cease buying Australian
butter and transfer their activities to
other imported butter. At this stage in
the dairying industry’s development Aus-
tralia cannot afford to make enemies of
those handling her butter.
* * . * *
Naturally prices in Australia have
violently receded. Even at the reductions
of the last fortnight, the Sydney market is
being cut to ribbons. Distributors are in
such a hurry to quit before stocks further
accumulate that reductions of Id. a lb.
are fashionable. The charges, too, for
patting, carting and boxes are tossed
aside if only sales can be made. The
local market stands at 121 s. 4d., but al-
most as much is going to the large
grocers at 112 s. as is being sold at the
conventional price. Quoting the cus-
tomer |d. or Id. off the fixed rate and
protecting him to the same extent against
any subsequent falls are of everyday
occurrence, notwithstanding that the dis-
tributing trade has covenanted to observe
the price fixed by the inter-State com-
mittee.
*.* * *
For the first 16 weeks of the present
season Australia’s butter exports show a
leeway of 8000 tons, the main falling-off
being her supply to J. Bull’s market.
That lag will soon be overtaken. The
third week of last month Australia’s total
gradings were over 6000 boxes greater
than they were for the same week of
last year. It seems that last year’s total
will be passed by Christmas, as all States
report an increasingly heavy production.
* * * *
“C.E.D.”: With supplies increasing
year by year, there is no wonder that
the London butter market is weak. Over-
supply is the cause. For the first eight
months of the current year J. Bull’s
butter arrivals increased by 23,314 tons.
Empire countries show a gain of 19,476
tons, while foreigners supplied an extra
3838 tons. Denmark’s total was down
by some 860 tons, but this was almost
cancelled by an extra 808 tons from
Siberia.
Stabilisation Is the Policy
“H.J.8.”: Stabilisation is in the air.
The butter men have stabilised their in-
dustry ; the feather squatters have the
same objective ; the cheese men last week
at Bodalla followed the butter men’s lead.
While N.S.W.’s manufacture of cheese
falls short of local requirements by some
3,000,0001 b. annually, the manufacture
of the great bulk in summer months
leaves the market overstocked during that
period. Consequently depressed prices
rule. Last season an effort was made to
clear the surplus by export, but some fac-
tories would not take the risk of lower
overseas prices. This year every factory,
whether privately or co-operatively
owned, has agreed to a scheme whereby
a levy of |d. a gallon on milk will be
paid into a fund which will be used to
balance up losses made on export. In
addition 25 p.c. of the daily make from
Nov. 1 will be manufactured in export
sizes.
Our Wine Export
“Z.Y.X.”: If wine goes to J. Bull’s
head, Australia will have to take her
share of the blame. During the first
eight months of the current year she
provided him with 2,250,000 gallons.
Portugal was second, being 389,000 gal-
lons behind Australia, and was followed
into third and fourth places by Spain and
France. South Africa came into the
picture with only 655,311 gallons. The
total importation was over 8,500,000
gallons for the eight months. Australia
is maintaining her monthly percentage.
If she does this until the end of the
year, the quantity of Australian wine will
have increased by over 1,000,000 gallons,
compared with the figures two years
ago.
Sydney Wool Market
“Anthony”: The third series of Sydney
sales began on Monday, October 30.
Initial results confirmed the good reports
from other centres, and prices hardened
gradually. The average per pqund lifted
from 12.7 d. for the last selling week in
Sydney to 14d., and the average per bale
from £l6 10s. 7d. to £lB 6s.
The inclusion of some “B Zone” wools
from cold-country districts contributed
toward the splendid result, but supplies
of them are hardly yet big enough to
make a substantial difference. Some of
the “B Zone” clips are not as stylishly
bred as they used to be.
Wool-selling Order
“Trepex”: Argument about country
wool-selling continues with unabated
vigor. It boils down to the fact that many
late-shearing growers sell their clips in
the sheds to get spot cash and avoid
several months of waiting contingent on
auction selling and the risk of a falling
market. Whatever such men may say
openly, they recognise that they have to
accept a discount from full market rates
in order to get the prompt ready-to-hand
sale. But they argue to themselves that
the market has so often gone against them
that the chances are that the price offered
by the country dealer is quite likely to
equal the amount which may be ulti-
mately realised in open auction. On an
average of years they might be wrong,
but they have a case of sorts.
* * * *
In the meantime the structure of our
auction system is being white-anted, and,
much as a few men might like to depart
from it, few of them would care to see it
wrecked. The auction method needs
reform, not scrapping.
* * * *
It would be injudicious to flood the
market with supplies of wool. Some
regular system of offering is necessary.
The order of arrival constitutes a good
basis of regulation.
The “zone” system has worked well
and has benefited a limited number of
growers. But it does not go far enough.
Its purely geographical basis is not so
scientific as it may seem. Could not the
season be divided into “time” zones, em-
bracing the separate arrivals within each,
and offering them in such proportion as
would spread the waiting over everyone?
Chilled Beef
“A.R.”: The dispatch of 200 quarters
of beef —equal to 50 head of stock—in
an experimental shipment to U.K. will
not prove the ability of Australia to pro-
vide in bulk the class of steer needed
for export. But it- will give some
idea of the results of the new process
used. The shipment came from the
A. C. and F. C. works at Aberdeen
(N.S.W.). The test will take place in
two chambers in the ship’s hold, one
carrying beef to the ordinary chilled tem-
perature of 29 to 31 degrees, and the
other at a similar temperature, plus 8 to
10 p.c. carbon dioxide. Even if the ship-
ment succeeds cost must still be con-
sidered. M.L., which plans for new-type
handling of its exportable beef surplus
(about 100,000 quarters), may be ahead of
Australia in establishing itself as a sup-
plier of chilled meat to U.K.
* * * *
If Australia is to become a factor in
the world’s supply of chilled beef an
immense amount of organisation will be
needed. We must produce a steer of good
quality, and fatten it close to the points
of treatment. A chilling steer should not
carry an excess of fat, which has been the
case with the frozen carcasses exported to
U.K. Only an early-matured steer can
present the bloom and color of the
Argentine beef.
Dried Fruit Exports
“J.L.S.”: Like other exported primary
produce, Australia’s shipments of dried
fruits for the first two months of the
present financial year show an excess of
11,500,0001 b. This represents an in-
creased cheque of £207,200 for the
growers. Raisins and currants are chiefly
responsible for the expanded girth of the
export business.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Sketched at Brisbane
The first figure in the portrait gallery
is one of the younger Labor members:
J. V. Hayes, aged 36, member for Nun-
dah since June last year. He was born
at Ipswich, and was a shop-assistant in
Ipswich, Maryborough and Brisbane be-
fore going into Parliament. He came
into prominence as an executive member
of the Shop Assistants’ Union; he is
also a keen sportsman, and was treasurer
of the Junior Rugby League. He is
shaping well in Parliament.
Next is Robert Ellersleigh Nixon-
Smith, big physically and big in the busi-
ness world ; his three lads are boxers,
swimmers, golfers and tennis players,
like dad. He acts as Lord Mayor when
J. W. Greene is out of town, and is Bris-
bane director of the James Patrick ship-
ping concern, director of the Moreton
Bay Stevedoring Co., and managing
director of the Nixon-Smith Dumping
Pty.—shipping and wool. Nixon-Smith
has probably handled more wool for
export in recent years than anybody else
in the northern State. He is still in the
early forties.
Third in the gallery is an old Labor
stalwart, Charles W. Conroy, a native of
Toowoomba, who has represented Mara-
noa in the Assembly since 1920. He won
the seat at a by-election, after it had
NORTHERN FACES, No. 10.

Charlie Conroy, M.L.A.
Philip Frankel.
H. A. Walters.
been lost by Labor in the previous year.
Over 41 years ago Conroy left his native
town for Roma. He was an alderman
there for many years, and three times
Mayor.
The fourth figure is Philip Frankel,
who has spent most of his life in the
leather-belt business. For over 25 years
he has been a member of Royal
National’s executive, and on occasions
has been vice-president.
Last comes H. A. Walters, who gave
up a secretarial position in private busi-
ness to help secretary H. W. Watson run
the Royal Show. The job is a credit to
both.
“Kokopo”: New Guinea census figures
for the year ending June 30 are especially
interesting as indicating a falling off in
the Chinese population of the Mandated
Territory. In the German days, the over-
lords of the country encouraged the
kong kong to settle, and he showed signs
of getting the same grip on the country
as he has got in Malaya, especially as
a trader and storekeeper. With the Aus-
tralian occupation, the immigration of
Chinese was forbidden, and the result
has been that death and retirement to
their native land of Chinese who had
made their money have been thinning
down their numbers, which must one day
dwindle to the native-born only. For
the rest, there were in all 5215 non-
indigenous inhabitants of the Territory,
1169 of these being on the goldfields and
984 at Rabaul. Natives are (very roughly)
estimated at 402,000, but double this
would probably fall short of the truth.
* * * *
“Retired Duffer”: Wheat is spreading
west in Queensland. Country which the
writer recalls as rated only fit to carry
cattle or sheep is under plough. Queens-
land expects a splendid wheat crop this
season. W. Binns, manager of the State
Wheat Board, has been very optimistic
about the reports to hand of the crop
in the Wallumbilla, Roma and Hodgson
districts, and “even as far west as
Mitchell” on the South Downs it will
be a record. In Jimbour, once sheep
country only, some very heavy yields
are expected. Binns goes on to say that
the whole of this countryside has taken
on a new aspect, and that the future will
see a change from cattle and sheep to
dairying and wheat-growing. I suppose
it is all to the good, but my heart flutters
at the idea of some of the Roma country
settling down to wheat.
* * * *
Darwin’s oldest inhabitant, Mrs. Kath-
arine Mansfield, has just had her 90th
birthday. Her father had fought at
Waterloo ; he arrived in charge of con-
victs in Tasmania, where Darwin’s old
lady was born. She had a personal touch
with events now in Australian history,
amongst them the Eureka Stockade, for
much of her early married life was spent
on Victorian goldfields. She has lived
in Darwin for 30 years.
* * * *
“X”: Brisbane people mean to show
the tourists who arrive on the s.s.
Ulysses that the State can grow flowers.
Members of the Horticultural Society,
marshalled by Alderman M. P. Camp-
bell, intend to decorate the ship when
it arrives. Every woman passenger will
get a shoulder-spray and every mere
man a buttonhole. It should do a little
to scotch the legend about our blooms’
scentlessness, but there should be more
in it than that. South Africa has given
the world a garden favorite in the
Gerbera jamesonii, and the rhododen-
dron, which makes the English country-
side a mass of bloom, is a reminiscence
of India. Some of our own flowering
shrubs and trees might easily develop an
equal world vogue—the boronias, for
instance.
* * * *
“Vic”: Aspersions have been cast
again on the northern State’s machinery
of fortune. Last time a small boy was
caught with a lottery marble in
his hand. Then the State discarded the
old barrel-and-marble system of drawing
for a machine which sceptics now say is
unreliable. However, the Home Secre-
tary doesn’t believe them.
* * * *
“Arukun”: Australia’s only woman
snake-hunter is the wife of a boundary-
rider on a cattle station in the Coleman
district (Cape York), who spends her
spare time collecting skins for market.
She has killed over 500 reptiles, her
largest “bag” being a 20ft. N.Q. python.
Once a black snake fastened its fangs
into her right leg. Treatment by the
“flying doctor” saved her life.
* * * *
“J.”: A revelation of resources was
provided by the Maryborough industrial
antiques exhibition. Maryborough is
one of the foremost cities of the Com-
monwealth from an industrial point of
view. Among the industries are iron,
brass and steel work, engines of all
descriptions, sugarmill machinery, bridge
work, stove castings, agricultural imple-
ments, all classes of woodwork and
furniture, pottery, flour mill, bacon
factory, fisheries, steel and concrete
pipes and coal. Hundreds of curios
were marshalled in the antique section,
including rare and beautiful pictures,
treasured photographs, jewellery, shawls,
crockery, old manuscripts and keepsakes
made over a century ago.
* * * *
J. P. Keogh, State member for Mer-
thyr (Q.), whose Irish accent and talking
speed worry “Hansard” staff, has read
his own obituary notice on two occa-
sions. An A.I.F. member, he was badly
wounded and lost his kit. After con-
valescence, he desired leave, and dis-
covered that he had died of wounds.
About two years ago the news of his
death was announced from the pulpit,
and friends arrived to express their con-
dolences, only to find the corpse push-
ing the lawnmower. The mistake was
due to a similarity in names and initials.
* * * *
“Jordan”: The large belt of country
which lies between the Dividing Range,
“north of the Carnarvons,” and the west-
ern downs in Queensland, locally
known as “Desert,” needs an economic
survey. It is forest country with a rain-
fall of 20 to 25 inches. It has saved
millions of sheep in the last 25 years.
Owners “perished out” in droughts on
the downs have been driven to agisting
their sheep on the hardier grass, such as
soft spinifex, and the abundant scrub.
With dog-netting and the judicious ring-
barking of the forest, leaving only the
edible scrubs, of which there is a great
variety and quantity, and the preserving
of all millable timber for shade trees, this
country is capable of carrying a sheep to
two acres with safety, for after the fine
grass has gone there is still the scrub
and the spinifex to fall back on. I
know the owners of 100,000-acre pro-
perties without a ring-barked acre on
them who moan that when the spinifex
is eaten out their properties won’t be
worth giving away. They are unmindful
of the fact that if only 50 per cent, of
their properties were ring-barked the
carrying capacity would be more than
doubled.
* * * *
“Kyuna”: The North scores decisively
on vital statistics despite its blighting
climate. The last monthly figures issued
by the Queensland Registrar-General
show Mackay leading on the birth-rate,
with Bundaberg a close second. The
highest marriage rates for the State
belong to Cairns, Mackay and Rock-
hampton.
* * * *
“X.J.”: The best bet to be got in Dar-
win on the proposed missionary expedi-
tion to Caledon Bay is “evens” that the
visitors will be able to make contact with
scattered outposts of King Buck-Eye’s
tribe, but odds are laid at 100,000 to 1
that nobody will surrender as a murderer.
It will be a nice mosquito-ridden, fever-
racked trip for Mr. Warren and his
companion, who have shown how little
they know about the business by electing
to go in the middle of the rainy season.
The Commonwealth is giving them a sub-
sidy, which would be better spent as an
instalment on an armed patrol boat. Next
season it may be necessary to send
another expedition to ask the local
Majesty “What have you done with our
missionaries?”
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Within the old-world dignity of St.
John’s Cathedral, Dean Barrett tied a
knot for Glory Burton and Eric Crooke.
When Glory, who has beautiful Titian
hair, followed the Inky Way she was
extremely popular. Her shimmer of satin,
moulding her slim figure, was allied to
cascades of tulle. She carried white car-
nations and wore a string of pearls, the
gift of the bridegroom. Sister Muriel,
in apricot taffetas, was ’maid. At Len-
non’s Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Burton wel-
comed 80 guests. The honeymooners
left on a motor tour to Melbourne.
There were few dry eyes at the
Lyceum Club on the occasion of the
memorial service to Elinor Barker, 8.A.,
who died recently. Mrs. E. Munro, ex-
president, unveiled the silky-oak tablet
dedicated to this beloved member.
After the final curtain of her farewell
concert at City Hall Bonnie Bell was
handed a big basket of flowers by the
Lady Mayoress, who arranged the con-
cert. From the shrew Katharine Bonnie
quickly changed into Nell Gwynne’s cart-
wheel feathered hat. Two acts from a
Maeterlinck play showed her dramatic
talent; she was equally at home in a
scene from “L’Aiglon.” Bonnie is to
study in London ; Sybil Thorndike laid
the seed for this ambition. Barbara
Sisley staged a cheery studio party after
the show.
The Mothercraft Association elected
Dr. Phyllis Cilento its president at the
annual meeting. This is the second time
the honor has been given her. That
Queensland mothers should buy for
sixpence a measuring-spoon, giving cor-
rect tea- and tablespoon measures, is
one of the many practical aims of the
Mothercraft. Dr. S. F. McDonald tackled
the report with enthusiasm, and was sup-
ported by several other medicoes.
To help along their funds, a few of
the National Council women worked
enthusiastically on Barrie’s “What Every
Woman Knows.” Gwen Hughes allotted
parts and arranged costumes. Helen Hill
had a word to say before the curtain was
raised on a fine performance. Mrs. Cum-
brae Stewart occupied a front seat. She’s
the president.
Glennie Old Girls did not find it hard
to fill the Women’s Club with over 200
bridge players to raise money for the
scholarship fund. The supper was
donated, so expenses were almost nil.
Mrs. T. G. Lahey chose a black lace
frock to act as hostess. A bouquet of
scarlet roses was presented to her, done
up in school colors. Pauline Elliott, the
president, had a lot to do with the suc-
cess of the party. Her ruby-red frock
was worn with a smart little coatee.
“Remember, remember, the fifth of
November.” Up here small boys were
only allowed to remember old Guy in
their own backyards. Police Commis-
sioner Ryan forbade crackers to pop off
in public places. Still, the backyards
were good enough and skyrockets went
just as high as ever.
Gwendolyn Grant has had eyes-front
on her easel for the past few month. She
has been preparing for her exhibition,
opened by Dr. W. N. Robertson, who
praised her work in portraiture and land-
scape. There is much to admire. On
the opening day everyone seemed to
linger before “Morning Sunlight,” which
depicts a girl knitting a garment in a
glorious royal blue, with the sun stream-
ing through a latticed verandah. Two
pastels also claimed attention.
Down the Jervis Bay gangway stepped
Major Charles Mattei, eager to start his
work of looking after Maltese residents
in Australia. He is going to take a mere
3000 or 4000 under his wing. For five
years the Major was medical officer at
Rosemount Military Hospital, so he had
plenty of friends meeting him. Lord
Mayor Greene welcomed him at the City
Hall.
Leaders are wanted for the Girl
Guides. With a membership of 4400
this should not be difficult.

physical fitness. Several organisations at Mascot
Aerodrome give instruction in flying. Communi-
cate with one of these. (5) There are two
classes of pilots’ licenses—private (A) and com-
mercial (B). For A license an applicant must
have completed at least 10 hours’ flying, of
which three hours’ must be solo. For a B license
a candidate must have completed at least 100
hours’ solo flying, and, in addition, must have
passed certain other general flying tests. (6) No.
(1) On how many occasions did Carbine
win the Melbourne Cup ? (2) When was the
first Cup race run and what was the prize and
winner ? —8364.
(1) Only once —in 1890. (2) In 1861, when
Mr. De Mestre’s Tim Whiffier won. The event
then was for a sweepstake of 20 sovs. The
first gold cup was presented for competition by
James Blackwood, chairman of the club. In
Carbine’s year the stake was £13,230.
(1) Information regarding the culture, matur-
ing and fattening of oysters, and (2) how to
preserve in bottles ? —8547.
(1) Get bulletin “The Story of the Oyster”
from Sydney Technological Museum; Is. Id.
posted. (2) The oysters must be perfectly
fresh. Pack in clean, sterilised bottles and
fill to the brim with («) water which has been
boiled with a little salt and a few blades of
mace, then strained and allowed to cool a
little, or (ft) a liquor made of half boiling
water and half white vinegar. Stand the bottles
in a boiler with straw packed round and under-
neath, raise the liquor in the bottles to boiling
point, keep at that temperature for half-hour,
then seal quickly and securely with sterilised
corks or screw-tops with new rubbers. There
must be no leakage, and sterilisation of all
utensils by heat is most important. If a large
quantity is to be done or you wish to bottle
regular supplies, make up a few batches with
the different liquors and endeavor to reduce the
time of cooking to the narrowest margin of
safe-keeping, as oysters are not improved by
being overcooked. Keep notes of times and
methods and allow one month to elapse before
opening to test.
Origin of the swastika ? —8667.
The symbol, also called fylfot, originated in
India or China, and was introduced into Europe
in the sixth century. It plays a part in the Bud-
dhist ritual. In Europe, in the Middle Ages,
the swastika often figured in decoration and
embroidery; e.g., on the mitre of Thomas
a’Becket. In Germany to-day the Nazis use the
swastika as a symbol of Aryanism and anti-
Semitism.
What is shagreen ? —8666.
The name given to the skins of sharks and
other fish which, being covered with closely-
set, calcified papillas, are used for polishing
purposes when prepared. A kind of rough-
grained leather made in Asia was also
called shagreen. It was manufactured from
the skins of horses and asses into which, when
moist, seeds were pressed. Imitation shagreen is
largely used in bookbinding.
(1) Are articles manufactured by prisoners in
Pentridge prison, Vic., for sale in the open
market, or can the goods be obtained by
private buyers ? (2) What is the approximate
value of the goods manufactured in that gaol ?
—8342.
(1) Official reply is that netting, clothing,
brushware, boots, mats and blankets made by
prisoners are principally absorbed by Govern-
ment depts. (2) The estimated value of the
output, 1931-32, was £44,357.
(1) In what year did Dick Arnst defeat W.
Webb for the world’s sculling championship ?
(2). What other world’s contests did Arnst win
between that date and his match with H. Pearce
in Sydney ? —8372.
(1) 1908, at Wanganui (M.L.). (2) The fol-
lowing year he again beat Webb on the
Wanganui. He defeated G. Welch at Akaroa
(M.L.) in 1910, outrowed E. Barry, of Eng.,
on the Zambesi the same year, and won from
Pearce on the Parramatta in 1911. In 1912
E. Barry took the championship from Arnst
on the Thames.
(1) What sort of glass is used in the manu-
facture of optical prisms ? (2) Description of
the largest telescope in the Sydney Observa-
tory ? (3) Can permission be obtained for a
.visit to the observatory, and how? —8592.
(1) Crown, flint and quartz glass are all
used. Esdaile, Hunter-street, Sydney, can fur-
nish particulars of prisms now on the market.
(2) It is a refractor with an object glass 11.4 in.
in aperture and a focal length of 12ft. 6in.
The object glass was made by Shroeder, ol
Hamburg, and the equatorial stand was de-
signed by the late H. C. Russell, Government
Astronomer, and constructed at Mort’s Dock
engineering works in 1883. (3) The observa-
tory is open to visitors on Wednesday aiter-
noons, 2 to 4 p.m., without any application.
If a night visit is desired, written application
must be made to the Government Astronomer.
There is always a long waiting list. Cards to
visit are sent in order of priority of receipt
of application.
(1) In what year was Ihe construction of the
Sydney city railway commenced ? (2) Was the
work to be done by contract or Government
clepts. ? (3) When completed, what will be the
routes ? —8379.
(1) In 1916. (2) Work was commenced by
a private co. under contract to the Govern-
ment, but this contract was closed and the con-
struction suspended in 1917. In Feb., 1922,
work was resumed by the Railway Commis-
sioners. (3) The system under construction
will form a complete two-track loop railway
around the city, running for the most part
underground, along the eastern side to Cir-
cular Quay and returning along the western side
to the Central Station. The scheme includes the
construction of a branch from the city,railway
to Bondi for the eastern suburbs, and a
branch from the main suburban line to Bal-
main to serve the western suburbs.
(1) In what countries are weaver-birds found ?
(2) Who has the greatest variety of weaver-birds

would it be necessary for the birds to go into
quarantine there ? —8507.
(1) Over 500 varieties are known. Viduince
are found mainly in India, Malaya and Aus-
tralia; Ploccinte in Africa. Some species origin-
ally supposed to belong to the weavers are now
referred to as Waxbills, the latter being Aus-
tralian relatives of the true weavers. Waxbills
are found in India and Africa. (2) Not known.
Communicate with S. Harvey, 60 Burnside-road,
Kensington, S.A. (3) So far as is known, the
quarantine laws of the South African Union do
not apply to finches.
Did Bob Turner and Jack Blackmore fight in
Sydney, and, if so, where and when ? How
many times did they meet, and what were the
results ? —8655.
Turner and Blackmore fought at the National,
where Fuller’s Mayfair Theatre now stands, in
1904. This was their only contest, and Turner
won on points in 20 rounds.
Names of books on charcoal gas-making and
its use in motor-car engines ? —B6lB.
The producer-gas sub-committee attached to
the Commonwealth Department of the Interior
has prepared a number of reports on the sub-
ject. Suggest that you obtain reports M.T.C.
5/28 and 1/30, which were printed and contain
information which may be of service. Charcoal
Traction Engineers Pty., Ltd., of 118-124
Toorak-road, South Yarra, Victoria, manufac-
ture a portable type of retort specially designed
for the production of charcoal. Information
regarding this retort and its price could be
obtained from the manufacturers.
Can a Vic. police pension be assigned ?
8707.
No, except in very rare cases. The
Vic. Police Regulation Act provides that every
assignment of and charge on a pension
and every agreement to assign a pension shall
(except so far as made for the benefit of the
family of the pensioner) be void, and on the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the pensioner the
pension shall not pass to any trustee or other
person acting on behalf of the creditors.
Where is the “case” of the sperm whale, and
does it contain oil ? —8596.
It is the large rectangular portion above
the upper jaw and in front of the eye. It con-
tains oil which is richer in spermaceti than that
of the body blubber, and therefore brings a
somewhat higher price.
If a married couple in N. S. Wales agree to
separate, how can they make it a legal separa-
tion ? —8636.
A decree of judicial separation may be
obtained from a Court either by the husband
or the wife on the grounds of adultery, of
cruelty, or of desertion without cause for two
years and upwards. Where the parties simply
wish to live apart under mutually-agreed-upon
conditions a deed could be drawn up by any
solicitor embodying such conditions.
(1) What color and what type are the natives
of the British Solomon Islands ? (2) Are they
increasing or decreasing ? —8714.
(1) The natives are mainly Melanesians, but
there are other types. The natives of the
islands in the Bougainville Straits are very black,
and those of New Georgia and Choiseul nearly
as dark. The natives of Ysabel, Malaita,
Guadalcanal, San Cristoval and Santa Cruz are
lighter in color, but the types and shades of
color vary on almost every island. It is thoughit
that among some of them there may be a cer-
tain Polynesian admixture. At Ongtong Java,
Sikiana, Rennell, Bellona, the Reef Islands and
Tucopia the natives are almost pure Polynesians.
(2) The natives are believed to be increasing
in numbers on some of the islands off the
beaten track, decreasing where they are in con-
tact with whites.
(1) What method does the Customs Dept,
adopt to determine the value of goods imported
into Australia for statistical purposes ? (2) What
is the meaning of the term “current domestic
value” used in relation to imports ? —8712.
(1) The value of goods imported from coun-
tries beyond Australia represents the amount
on which duty is payable or would be payable
if the duty were ad valorem. Section 154 (1)
of the Customs Act, 1901-30, provides that
“when any duty is imposed according to value,
the value for duty shall be the sum of (a)
(1) the actual money price paid or to be paid
for the goods by the Australian importer, plus
any special deduction; or (21 the current domes-
tic value of the goods, whichever is the higher;
lb) all charges payable or ordinarily payable
for placing the goods free on board at the port
of export; and (c) 10 p.c. of the amounts
specified under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
sub-section.” (2) “Current domestic value” is
defined as “the amount for which the seller
of the goods to the purchaser in Australia is
selling or would be prepared to sell for cash, at
the date of exportation of these goods, the same
quantity of identically similar goods to any and
every purchaser in the country of export for
consumption in that country.”
Who was the bushranger known as “The
Wild Scotchman,” who used to operate in
Q’land in the ’sixties ? Did he lead a gang,
and what was his fate ? —8730.
His name was Alpin Macpherson. He came
from N. S. Wales, and mostly carried on his
depredations single-handed. His raids were prin-
cipally on stations and travellers. He was cap-
tured and sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment
with hard labor in 1863.
How is three-handed euchre played ? I can
play the two-handed and four-handed game ?
—8748.
Here each plays for his own hand. The
value of the march and point are the same
as in the two-handed or four-handed game, but
if the challenging player is euchred, each of
his adversaries scores two points. If this should
carry them both “out,” the elder hand is the
winner. To avoid this, which is hardly a
satisfactory termination for the younger hand,
another method of scoring is sometimes adopted,
the points for the euchre being deducted from
the score of the euchred player, who is “set
back” accordingly. Should he have made no
points towards game, he is considered to owe
the points for the euchre; so that a player stand-
ing at love when euchred (five points making
game) has seven points to make before he
can win.
/ am shortly to be married in M.L. to an
Australian, sailing immediately for Australia.
What duty is chargeable on household linen and
wedding presents ? —8571.
Under Tariff Item 409 passengers’ personal
effects, furniture and household goods which
have been in actual use by such passengers for
at least one year, not exceeding £lOO in value for
each adult passenger (two child members of
a family may be reckoned as one adult),
are admitted free of all duties. If the house-
hold goods have not been in use for the period
specified, ordinary tariff rates apply. Household
linen not admissible under Tariff Item 409, if of
M.L. origin, is subject to an ad valorem duty
of 10 p.c.; if of U.K. origin, ad valorem duty
of 25 p.c.; and if classifiable under general
tariff, to an ad valorem duty of 45 p.c. Prim-
age 10 p.c. plus sales tax 6 p.c. is imposed in
all these cases.
Latest estimate of world’s annual silver
output ? —8664.
Latest available complete computation is for
1931 (figures represent fine ounces): U.S.A.,
30,822,042; Canada, 20,558,216; Mexico,
86,064,457; Central America, 4,000,000;
Bolivia and Chile, 6,044,968; Peru, 8,957,022;

(1) Is the Venus de Milo considered to re-
present the perfect female figure ? (2) By whom
was she sculptured ? (3) How did she get her
arms broken off, and why was no attempt made
to put them on again? (4) Measurements of
her neck, bust, waist, hips, thigh, calf and
height ? —8485.
(1) Tastes differ. Most modern painters and
sculptors, judging by their works, prefer the
slimmer form, represented by the Venus de
Medici. (2) Unknown. There are reasons to believe
that it was either the work of Scopas, of a
master of Scopas, or of a pupil of that sculptor.
(3) The statue was exhumed in its present state
after years of burial, and the arms were not
recovered. (4) Neck, 12 -jin.; bust, 37in.; waist,
26in.; hips, 38in.; thigh, calf, 13^in.;
height, sft. 4in.
Did W. E. Gladstone own a plantation and
keep slaves ? —8609.
Sir John Gladstone, the statesman’s father,
owned a plantation in Demerara, West Indies.
Gladstone’s maiden speech in the Commons,
June 3, 1833, was made in defence of the
conditions on that plantation, in which, he
admitted, he had a pecuniary interest. He de-
clared himself as an advocate of “gradual
emancipation,” but said that in the meantime
the slaves must be “religiously educated and
stimulated to profitable industry.”
(1) What were the terms of the Peace Treaty
between Russia and Japan ? (2) Casualties on
both sides ? —8668.
(1) Russian rights in Port Arthur and Dalny
passed to the Japanese, Sakhalien was divided
between the opposing countries, no indemnity
was to be paid by Russia, the Manchurian rail-
way became the property of Japan, Korea
became a Japanese sphere of influence, Man-
churia was evacuated by both armies and re-
stored to China, and fishing rights in the
Behring Sea were ceded to Japan. (2) Japan,
about 170,000; Russia, about 400,000.
What is emphysema, and how is it treated ?
—8727.
Medically, it consists of an enlargement of air
vesicles of the lungs, which are the termina-
tions of air passages. It occurs in bronchitis
and other conditions where there is excessive
coughing. It causes lessening of the aerating
surface of the lung and shortness of breathing;
in young lads it may only give trouble on
exertion. In older persons with chronic bron-
chitis the chest becomes enlarged and barrel-
shaped from decreased capacity of the lung,
requiring increased depth of breathing. In-
creased work is also thrown on the heart to
drive the blood through the inflated lung. In
time the heart fails to drive sufficient blood
through, so that its action is embarrassed, and
the badly aerated blood causes the sufferer to
look blue. The treatment of emphysema con-
sists in attending to the underlying causes, the
bronchitis or asthma, and in maintaining the
action of the heart.
(1) What are the rules for the indentation of
lines of poetry ? I have tried to arrive at these
by examination of several samples, but can find
very little consistency. Does the indentation
depend on the writer or the printer, or both ?
(2) Should the first paragraph of a prose com-
position be indented ? —8615.
(1) It depends on the metre. Generally speak-
ing, lines should start on the same mark, or
indentation, as the lines they rhyme with, though
it is no absolute rule. (2) It may be either
indented, commenced unindented, with the first
word in capitals, or glorified by an ornamental
initial, flush with the column or indented. Book-
publishers and newspapers have their individual
styles in these matters.

(1) Under the N.S.W. Metropoli-

of the board to make a payment, under certain
conditions, of £5 as compensation. (3) N 0....
Z.L.P.: As the separation is by mutual agree-
ment, and not by legal process, the question
of allowance is between the parties alone. In
Maoriland a wife can get a divorce on the
ground of separation by virtue of an agreement,
written or verbal, which has been in force for
three years, and the Court would fix. alimony.
The separation must, however, have been by a
magisterial order or judicial decree. As the
husband is residing in Australia, the matter
may be complicated by the question of domicile.

Sonnets of a Shopgirl.
(No. 2.)
Well, Arcourt has peculiar tastes in clothes.
His outer duds were all from different suits;
He wore a boater straw and ox-blood boots,
And swung a stick. Same with his choice of
shows,
Though others liked that English muck, I
s’pose:
One of them films where everybody shoots
And says “Oh, yeah?”—except two Cockney
coots
Who come in dancing—why, God only knows.
It ended with a wild machine-gun fight
In Chelsea, where the gangsters stood at bay.
My pommy bubbles over with delight.
Above the racket people heard him say
Them English pictures made him ’omesick
quite—
“C’n almost smell the ’awthorn and the may.”
After the Feast of English Art he said
He felt like stoking up. “I’m with you, boy,”
I tell him; and I call for tea and “poi,”
The dinkum Aussie style. He shakes his head,
Superior-like. “Strong tea and ‘pay,’ with
bread
And buttah, Miss,” he orders —“and a haice.
“You ’ave one, too,” he says to me. “They’re
naice.”
I’m on; so we on “pays” and “haices” fed.
I s’pose I should have countered pretty smart
When he corrected me; but, never mind.
I scarcely think he meant to be unkind.
He likes himself, but -seems to have a heart.
The way he drops his aspirins is queer,
But lots of nobles do it, so I hear.
The boy-friend’s tongue keeps wagging while he
gnaws.
That time of night you’ll always strike a
crowd
What’s out for sport; and Arcourt talks so
loud
And cuts such funny capers with his paws,
That one might say he give them jokers cause
To pick on him. At first they only grin
And nudge each other slily in the din
That’s mostly Arcourt. How he clacked his
jaws!
“We’re bankahs, lawyahs, .shipownahs,” he
cried,
“Us Willoughby Carters. ’Cept me Uncle
Pitt,
The famous potter. Bet he made this
ware.”
With that he grabs the crockery, bit by bit,
And starts examining the under side
To see (the noodle!) what was printed there.
It sets ’em going properly. I heard
A fellow near me holler to his mates,
“Let’s do what Fly-rink’s doing with the
plates.”
There’s seven in his push; and at the word
They imitate poor Arcourt, every bird.
Then others all around them take it up:
Soon everybody’s turning up a cup.
I nearly died —the thing was so absurd.
To see them creatures going on like that,'
All laughing fit to bust theirselves the while,
Was more than I could stand. I had to
smile.
But Arcourt muttered, shoving on his hat,
Some enemy had started all the row;
He’d track him down and spiflicate the cow.
“What dilly things the people does in mobs!
It’s what they call sikology, I’m shore,”
I says to Arcourt when we reached the door.
“Scum!” he replies.' “See ’ow they barracked
Obbs,
And ’ooted Larwood! Pays their measly bobs
And thinks they ’ave a perfeck right to roar
At English gents.! Jardine, though, made
’em sore.
’E wipes the snickers off their ugly nobs.”
All the way home, poor dear, he went off pop.
“111-mannahed swayne,” he says, “I reely
should
Have collahed one and dragged him to a cop.
The coolah would have done the beggah
good.”
He looked as if he’d half a mind to cry.
I let him kiss me when he said good-bye.

(To be continued.)
“The Antiquary”: All the early
bridges over the Thames were of wood
(B. 11/10/’33); it was not until a.d. 1176
that the first stone bridge (between the
city and Southwark) was commenced, the
architect being Peter of Colechurch, a
chantry priest. It was completed in 1209.
The 20 arches of this 926 ft. bridge were
supported by 19 massive piers, resting
on strong elm piles protected by ster-
lings. A huge crowd was trapped
on the bridge in 1212 by houses at each
end catching fire. It is said that 10,000
persons were either burnt to death or
drowned in the swirling rapids, but the
ancient chroniclers may have added a
nought or two.
“Carteret”: I never heard the yarn
about Labouchere referring to himself
with a twinkle as “the Christian mem-
ber for Northampton” (B. 25/10/’33).
Labby’s nephew and biographer,
Thorold, however, after mentioning that
his uncle had an essentially irreligious
nature, while Bradlaugh had “the soul
of a Covenanter,” records that Randolph
Churchill once delighted the House of
Commons by particularising Labou-
chere, to avoid confusion, as the religious
member for Northampton, and adds
that no one relished the jest more than
the subject of it. Labby, by the way,
was the staunchest of all Bradlaugh’s de-
fenders, little though the pair had in
common, during' the bitter controversy
of the early ’eighties. One memorable
sentence in which he put the whole case
for his persecuted colleagne was: “Why
should a man be hindered from per-
forming civil functions in this world on
account of speculative opinions about
another?”

practical moments when they get down to the
hard realities of life:
It requires great care
To operate on a corn;
Use a sterilized needle
To extract a thorn;
On a festered linger
A bread poultice apply ;
A tea-leaf bandage
Will releave a sore eye.
P.M.L.: You rhyme ill and erratically.
And lines like “drug’s vile mask of lust’s foul,
leering wreck” and “crouching fevered wretch
on dice’s torturing wrack” suggest that your
Pegasus needs a firmer hand upon the rein....

too extravagant... .J.T.: “If no good, throw

years without a break.” It sets us vaguely
wondering what you might have written on
Tristan d’Acunha... .T.T.G.: Your rhyming
shows a determination to improve, even with
occasional lapses such as “Euclid-lucid,” and
“dialectic-dyspeptic.” What you need now
and haven’t hit on yet is to find something to
say that’s worth saying

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
While Melbourne has the Cup, Sydney
has the dregs ; and no city its size can
be expected to get merry on heeltaps.
Even when the Cup has been bagged and
the diamond-dusted ones recross the bor-
der, the beaches and Christmas shopping
will absorb their energies. From mid-
November till the end of February the
great problem is how to keep cool, and
practically all parties except house
parties, picnic parties and water parties
fade from the horizon.
Saturday was dull. It was set in the
aspic of a week’s stagnation. A grey
sky emitted chilly gouts of rain at irre-
gular intervals. It was a day on which
a woman remembered her sins and just
where her latest frock didn’t fit her. But
the dance in the Royal Motor Yacht Club
at Point Piper brightened up the evening,
and once within the rooms, brilliant with
lights and decorations, the cloud wrack
of the night sky was forgotten. Commo-
dore Stuart Doyle and his wife acted as
hosts to the flag officers and their wives;
and on their table was a flower model
of Stuart Doyle’s Miramar.
The Guild of Empire embroidered its
annual meeting with tea-leaf and Eclair;
the Guilders chattered their way into the
Blaxland Galleries, its red lacquer furni-
ture a gala background for their glad
summer clothes. The guild is now four
years old, its membership sprouts with
the suddenness of the mushroom and
the strength of the oak; so the soul of
Adela Pankhurst Walsh soars, and the
hat of president Mrs. David Maughan
is worn at a blithesome angle. George
Mason Allard, one of the city’s strong,
silent business men, came along to make
a speech. The knight, being in the
accounting line, was naturally struck by
the bit in the report which said the finan-
cial position was satisfactory. Secretary
Mrs. Royes Metcalfe and treasurer Mrs.
F. Batchelder had the honey of praise
for tea. Elsa Corry sang, and pleased not
only dozens of female but several pairs
of male ears, among them Canon Ham-
mond’s and Dr. W. S. Ziele’s.
A nation-builder came to town last
week. She is Sister H. Brooks, of the
Far West Travelling Health Clinic, whose
nursing district covers a mere 4000-mile
radius. Scattered about her far-flung
horizons are 30 towns, some of which
cannot be reached by train. But where
the rail ends, the air routes begin, and
sister flies, a ministering angel, armed
with her three certificates (general, obstet-
ric and Tresillian), her sympathy and her
experience. It takes her two months to
do the rounds among her babies of the
Far West; last year there were 2000 of
them, many of whom were mustered for
their christening by sister. Occasionally
she acts as organist to church services and
weddings a hundred miles or so Back o’
Bourke; last year she answered 400
letters of inquiry, and she manages to
wedge in lectures on mothercraft to the
older girls in the little townships. Here
is an odyssey for some Australian pen ;
its theme the heroism of the wife and
mother of the outback, its note that
struck by Sister Brooks, who declares:
“The hearts of the people are as big as
the spaces they live in!”
The day will yet come for a woman to
be invested with the gold chain and
rabbitskin as Sydney’s Lud Mayor. The
latest of the sex to attain to aldermanic
honors is Mrs. Sylvia Stapleton, widow
of Paddington’s former Mayor; Mrs.
Stapleton consented to contest the vacancy
caused by her husband’s death, and
topped the poll. She is president of the
Labor Women’s Central Organising Com-
mittee and was on the State A.L.P.
executive.
The Society of Women Writers has
elected Isabel Gullett as its president for
the incoming year. Isabel is one of the
best-known and most popular women
journalists in Sydney, and is- a sister to
knight Harry, who in his early youth was
one of the “Herald’s” bright young men.
Veteran Henry Gullett was an uncle, and
Barbara Baynton a connection by mar-
riage. The family crest is a quill-pen
rampant over an ink-well couchant,
Isabel has held various offices in the
S.W.W. since its foundation.
52 Macleay-street is trying to look like
No. 10 Downing-street. Within its walls
Mrs. Harry Levy, sister to the Governor-
General’s lady, will eat, sleep and have
her being during her Sydney visit. The
Orford brought Mrs. Harry and daugh-
ter Mrs. H. Maitland (who was Molly
Levy) to Australia ; the Oronsay will take
them back to England. Once the cup has
been drained, their Commonwealth Exes,
will act host and hostess at Canberra to
the travellers.
Last week when everybody else seemed
to be rushing off to book sleepers in the
Melbourne express, Harry Dangar and
Wal Taylor with great originality popped
into the Morinda and wallowed across
opal and turquoise seas to Lord Howe
Island. Harry hopes to net the nucleus
of a new show, and has gone off with a
great painting equipment. Wal has taken
a butterfly net and a shrimping net, and
his bookbindings will no doubt be the
richer by all sorts of marine and crusta-
cean motifs. They are putting up at The
Pines, and the chair that was Sir Philip
Game’s particular perch is being brought
out in their honor. They possibly drew
lots or played musical chairs for it on
the night of their arrival.
G. B. Lancaster, whose novel
“Pageant” wraps in a starry banner the
of Tasmania’s beginnings, is a
native of the Apple Isle, though her
earliest stories were set in Maoriland.
“Pageant,” a best-seller in England and
America, has already been translated
into Scandinavian, and is now being
turned into the Latin tongues. G.B.L.
(who away from her publishers is Miss
Littleton) spent her early childhood and
girlhood in Enzed, and it was from across
the Tasman she sent her first stories to
The Bulletin. Later on these were pub-
fished in book form, together with a
group that had appeared in the “Wind-
sor” and other overseas papers. “Jim
of the Ranges” (her first novel, pub-
lished 15 years ago) is still going strong,
and was recently filmed in Hollywood.
Her latest work, now running in serial
form through American publications
under the title of “God’s Answer,” will
shortly appear between covers as “The
World Is Yours.”
It is five years since Miss Lan-
caster was last in Sydney; she
called in then on her way to England.
She has lived for long periods in the
Channels Isles, her brother, who is one
of the experts for the Triplex Safety
Glass industry, having his home in Jer-
sey. Auckland is the author’s next port
of call, and it is her intention to stay
there for two years —perhaps a novel
with a stirring Maori background will
be the result. Last Friday the press-
women roystered with her over the tea-
leaves ; to-day the Society of Women
Writers is holding a lunch in her honor.
In her early twenties Zena Moller has
captured an honors degree in science,
written plays that have been performed
over the air, and sung as soloist with the
Sydney Philharmonic Society. Her voice
has been heard by the best critics and
passed as sound in wind and limb. It
is capable of going up to an octave above
the ordinaiy singer’s without being in the
least shrill or train-whistley. Last week
the A.B.C. did Zena’s play “Sunset Isle,”
and her next effort is to be “Pigeons on
the G.P.0.,” to be broadcast next week.
Miss Moller hails from Condobolin.
Knight Tom Bavin’s lady will have
work after her own heart when theN.S.W.
Bookstall Co. opens its kiddies’ library
on the 28th of November. The library is
already well stocked with books recom-
mended by the lady, in whose brain the
idea originated. It is on the first floor of
the Bookstall’s Market and Castlereagh
streets home, and here on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Saturdays the former Pre-
mier’s wife will be in attendance to direct
the reading of the young. There is
already a municipal library for children,
and the two kind-hearted Rivett sisters
run another for love out amid the arid
streets of Surry Hills, but the Bookstall
is probably establishing the first commer-
cial venture of its kind in Sydney. Pre-
sident of the Institute of Journalists
Elliott Napier will be the high priest of
the opening ceremonial.
News came to Mrs. Arthur Erdos re-
cently that Portugal had honored her
father Arthur Loureiro. Pre-war Aus-
tralia knew this artist and his works very
well, and the Melbourne Gallery has two
of his paintings: “The Dream of St.
Stanislaus” and “Baron.” For many
years before his return to his native land,
Mr. Loureiro was art master at the Pres-
byterian Ladies’ College in Melbourne.
Up till the time of his death last year, he
was still active as a teacher and had his
studio in the Crystal Palace, Oporto. In
that city a few months ago the Govern-
ment unveiled a bronze medallion of his
fine old head to commemorate his service
to art.
Stout Cortez never stood more silent
and overawed upon his peak in Darien
than woman sits in the St. James when
Jean Harlow hops in and out of her luxu-
rious bed in “Dinner at Eight.” Jean
is the platinum-blonde wife of a bluster-
ing he gold-digger, and her nightgown is
a breath-arresting affair of white satin,
very tight and altogether backless. It is
kept on by a narrow halter-like strap
around the neck. When Jean wants to
be really warm and cosy she draws on
a bed jacket entirely composed of white
tulle frills. She sends for the doctor, and
makes herself more attractive by shedding
the tulle frills and drawing on a white
satin envy-arouser, trimmed with a lus-
cious crop of white Arctic fox. The
teens and upwards should make a note
of the black velvet evening frock worn
by Madge Evans.
There was a touch of the grandiose
about the Littorio Ball, which set all Italy
in Sydney tripping to the Wentworth.
Sixteen girls dressed in classic white
robes such as might have adorned the
Roman flappers who sat in the ladies’
gallery (if there was such a thing) when
Caesar thundered in the Capitol were
among the highlights. They held aloft
floral swords tied with the white,
red and green of Italy, and gave the
Fascist salute during the passage of
the Consul-General and his Marchesa
from the entrance to the seats of the
mighty. Among the official group were
the popular Prince del Drago, Bertie
Kelly and the medical Morans. Both the
doctor and Professor Waterhouse wore
their Italian decorations, and the various
Consuls also brought illuminated chests
to add to the glitter of the night.
The bundle of faggots under which the
heaped flame of red roses burned had
no reference to Nero and his bonfires.
It was the Littorio, from which the ball
derived its name, and it was set above
the official table for a twofold symbol;
the celebrations commemorated not only
the King of Italy’s birthday and the
Italian armistice, but also the Fascist
march on Rome. And the Fascist Bene-
volent Fund was the night’s beneficiary.
The dignified Marchesa, in her sweep-
ing magnolia satins and deep-red roses,
was among the night’s handsome. Or-
ganiser Mrs. Stassi edged the cape of her
beige lace frock with beige fur ; Sophie
Segaert flashed royal blue in the dance ;
Angela Stassi trod her measures in ver-
milion chiffons. The Baccarinis were
there, and Dr. and Mrs. Bernardi.
You can’t keep the Red Cross down.
Even when it rains on a function that set
out to be a garden party, the organisers
turn it into an indoor party which be-
comes even more fun. The lawns of
Hopewood House, Miss Jobson’s school
at Darling Point, were to have provided
greeny promenades for many grown-ups
on Saturday, and nice bumping-off places
for the young slippery-sliders and see-
sawers. But the wind blew and the rain
fell, so everybody went indoors to the
ballroom and the big hall. The Murray
lady from Papua, who made a speech,
was greeted by a guard of honor of
Junior Red Crossers ; then the Hughes
lady, Mrs. George Earp and Miss Jobson
extended further welcome. There was
a programme of ballet dancing, and Doris
Fitton and a group of her players pre-
sented a one-acter.
Poet and playwright Arthur Adams is
settled in a garden of roses that
would make old Omar’s look like a
cabbage-patch. The fragrant spot is at
Epping (it was the home of one of the
old Civil Service Stores chiefs), and no
fewer than 500 Radiance rose-bushes are
at present in bloom. Each bud stretches
a neck 18 inches long to sun and shade,
and each day Mrs. Arthur picks 24 dozen
and sends them to market.
Cocktails of welcome are being shaken
in honor of the Marchesa Torrigiani,
whose father was the forceful General
Fiaschi'. The lady left Sydney 26 years
ago, married into a Florentine family,
made her home in Rome, and now for
the first time in a busy life finds time to
revisit Australia. She brings daughter
Waltha with her; brother Dr. Piero
Fiaschi will be her host.

FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must sav6 money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank provides a friendly, efficient
savings service—all the time.

S.E.B. Melbourne.
Melbourne
Chatter
Flemington looked its very best for
the Derby. Anemones and ranunculi
clustered profusely alongside the mile ot
avenue from the entrance gates, and little
rock-lilies clinging thickly to the stony
border of the gravel drive streaked past
the long line of cars in a pinky-purply
blur. A Rolls brought the Lieut.-Gov-
ernor with his lady ; a Delage bore the
Apple Isle’s Exes. Just before the first
race a Packard drew up with the G.-G.
and his wife. Black-and-white was Lady
Isaac’s choice and later in the afternoon
she was thankful to do up all the buttons
of her full-length coat. Half a gale of
wind whirled round the stand, its icy
fingers piercing thin raiment and making
a mess of carefully-waved locks. In the
multitude were many faces familiar in
other States. If the N.S.W. folk backed
Sydney horses they must have made the
price of their holiday.
Lord Apsley, his natty duds sur-
mounted by a bowler hat, chatted
with the Alan Spowers coupie. Aide
Harold Wilkinson was noticeably well-
turned-out, also Major McDonald, who
sported white spats and a pink car-
nation. Belltoppers, black, grey and
mud-colored, sprouted like mushrooms —
altogether the men were especially smart.
Mrs. H. Rosenthal’s brown lacquered
cape and stiffened eye-veil merit a word.
Lorraine Cumming wore an ice-blue light-
weight wool ensemble, grey pelts trim-
ming her sleeves above the elbows.
Jocelyn Mackinnon’s choice of coat ran
along the same lines as regards color.
Silver foxes swung from the shoulder of
Mrs. Neville Fraser’s navy ripple cloth
with its bolero and striped blouse. A
silver band glinting under the ankle of
a sheer stocking was the jewellery chosen
by a wearer of a ravishing coat of summer
ermine. Mrs. Brendon O’Sullivan
emanated the smartness of all-beige. Her
georgette frock was protected with a
light rep. coat. A white blouse with
twinkly rhinestone buttons was tucked
under the black suit worn by Mrs. Roy
Chambers, and one of the popular linen-
tweeds, in beige with a brown check scarf
effect, suited Mrs. Jack Goulding. Mrs.
Bill Winter-Irving tilted a small hat above
a claret-colored coat.
Melbourne is wondering if exciting
frocks are created for wearing to races or
if races were invented simply for the
wearing of exciting frocks. Women who
have with optimism left their turnouts till
the last week or two are feverishly rush-
ing in and out of shops looking for
models or reach-me-downs, depending
upon the state of their bank accounts.
Dressmakers “simply haven’t a moment.”
As to milliners, they are up to their
arched eyebrows with hats to order and
don’t care a jot whether you buy their
wares or not. They and the weather work
hand-in-hand. A flick of rain from a
Melbourne sky ten minutes after it is
radiantly blue and your little bows and
flip-flaps have to come off for renova-
tions. If you are out in a real spatter the
stuff of which this summer’s millinery is
made needs reblocking. It is about time
someone put on the market a waterproof
hat protector.
Gold braid of the navy, red army coats
and blue upon lapels and limbs of the
Air Force invaded the Town Hall for the
Naval and Military Ball. Taxis with
their decorative cargoes nosed their way
through a solid phalanx of Friday night
shoppers who mobbed the portico.
Colonel G. I. Stevenson was host of the
evening. The Apple Isle’s Governor Sir
Ernest Clark and his lady were among
the dozen who were welcomed upon the
carpeted dais. Troopers wearing topees
and much white braid made themselves
into a picket fence, through which the
special guests were trumpeted and
drummed to supper. In the procession
was Mrs. Adrian Cole in gracefully
swinging brocades and a slim maiden of
the Deniliquin Falkiner clan, in ice-blue
ninon.
Mrs. Dalglish’s cocoa laces carried a
spray of golden flowers; Mrs. Wright
came with her colonel, in a black and
white medley with folded-wing draperies
of black satin ; Captain and Mrs. Ellis
were there, lily-of-the-valley nestling
upon her black lacquered shoulder. Mrs.
Cecil McKay kept a little black velvet
coat over her chalk-white frock ; Hilary
Hetherington wore one of her trousseau
gowns—tomato-striped chevron ; Mrs. B.
Foley was in blue lace; Babs Clarke
sprigged little pink buds upon her blue
tulle and Eileen Crisp’s sand-dune laces
were tied with an emerald sash.
Supper was served “upper” and
“lower,” with oysters to herald in the
meal. The shellfish had to agree with
all sorts and kinds of drinks, for there
was a free bar to make things merry.
Generals Blarney, Johnson and Stewart
stole a few minutes from the dancing
young things for a confidential chat
among the cane chairs dressed up in
calico covers. Four little debs, made their
first flight from the parental tree-top.
Natalie Skinner, Patricia Wellington and
Barbara Haynes chose conventional white
and wee posies ; Betty Appleton’s satins
were of'the palest green, and tiny green
buds nestled in her brown curls.
Lily-of-the-valley shed its perfume
through No. 9 when Mr. and Mrs. W. J.
Griffiths gave a dance for daughter
Nancy. The hostess kept an eye on the
young things’ welfare in fuchsia chiffon
enlivened with velvet flowers. Nancy
wore ivory lacquered satin, a train making
a radiant success of its meek simplicity.
Lame ribbon bound her bouquet of roses.
Another fledgling was her friend Wendy
Outhwaite, who stormed the citadel of
grown-up society in caped-and-flounced
white ninon. Dr. and Mrs. Balcombe
Quick were there, and among other in-
vited meds. were Alan Mackay, Cyril
Tonkin and S. Pern, each with his better
half. Mrs. W. H. Quick (the flowers
that adorned the rooms were plucked in
her Macedon garden) wore black and
silver stitchery. Judith Campbell rustled
spring-green laces. Jessie Brookes was
one of the wearers of organdie shoulder
whirls. Fresh and starchy, these decora-
tive bits are usually brought to the party
in a cardboard box under the arm of the
wearer’s escort. A snip of press-studs
off-stage and a simple garment is an
up-to-the-moment confection.
Herewith the Contessa di San Marzano,
Betty Johnson that was. Lieut.-Colonel
and Mrs. Keatinge Johnson took their
daughter, who has talent as a painter, to
Rome six years ago. While studying art
and seeing the City of the Caesars the girl
met and married her Count, who is an
officer of the Italian army. The couple
now have two little boys. Every summer
the Contessa takes them up to the moun-
tains and takes also her paint-box and
little camp-stool. This week her parents
unpacked a crate full of her water-colors.
On the opening day there was a pepper-
ing of red seals on her pictures, hung in
Kurrajong House.
Irene Anderson and Joan Rundle are
over from Sydney for the races. Mrs.
Murray Lawrence, Nan Holden and
Phyllis Bray have come from beyond the
S.A. border.
The lass whose Titian locks are hidden
under the leather flying-cap is the first
birdwoman in the British Empire to rank
as an aviation instructor. She is Freda,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. H. Thomp-
son, of South Yarra. She started soaring
aloft three years ago, and she has an
array of trophies, won at air-tourneys,
and a lot of greasy toil to her credit in
the workshop—you can’t be an instructor
if you don’t know why the wheels go
round. Toorak College is Miss Thomp-
son’s Alma Mater. As a wind-up to her
schooldays she had a trip abroad, which
included cruises to Norway and the Medi-
terranean, and she now claims to be
immune from both sea- and air-sickness.
Broothorn made the portrait.
The Ernest Jones couple gave one of the
many farewell parties for Major and Mrs.
Coleman. Dancing feet on the closed-in
verandah tuned in to blues and foxtrots,
which echoed up and down Fairview
Grove. The host of the evening discov-
ered a talent for verse and wrapped up
each clue to the treasure hunt in a piece
of rhyme (Little Greta Harrison and one
of Major Coleman’s brothers won cigar-
ettes for their nimble wits). Derek Conolly,
with steel rings and other gadgets, proved
that he would have made more money
following in Dante’s footsteps than by
entering the Air Force. Mrs. Coleman
wore sapphire velvet and a shoulder spray
of pink blossom, and Mrs. Jones warmed
her black velvet gown with a white velvet
coat.
Summer holds sway in Adelaide:
A roaring hot wind and clouds of dust made
patrons of the races at Cheltenham uncomfort-
able, but the attendance was large. Afternoon
tea was presided over by chairman J. H.
Morish and his wife, the lady in a white linen
suit, black organdie blouse and white hat.
Linen check and linen tweed suits were very
popular.
The Mayoress’s reception-room was crowded
when delegates attending the builders’ confer-
ence were entertained by the civic heads. Mrs.
Glover wore a black crepe de Chine flowered in
blue and beige, and her hat was a black straw.
She was assisted by her nieces, Miss Bowley,
of Sydney, and Jean Atkinson.
A combined bridge and tennis tournament at
the residence of Mrs. S. McGregor Reid,
Millswood, brought in over £l3 for the Queen
of Spring, representing the Free Kindergartens
at the Kuitpo Fair. Winners of the tennis
prizes were Jean McKay and Jean Angel.
The bridge players had the best of it, for the
house was beautifully cool, while the sun that
blazed on the tennis court sent the thermo-
meter into three figures. Mrs. Reid entertained
all at luncheon on the verandah.
Mayoress Glover gave a very large afternoon
party to all those who have been on com-
mittees with her during her term of office. The
hostess wore black georgette, and a black straw
hat wreathed with pink roses.
The library at the Y.W.C.A. was decorated
with roses when a tea party was given in honor
of Amy Snelson, who was the national secre-
tary of the association some years ago. Mrs.
P. S. Messent welcomed the guest. Miss Snel-
son left later in the day for the Eastern States.
At the Piccadilly Mrs. N. McGilp gave a fare-
well party for Mrs. F. W. Muirhead, who is
leaving to reside in Melbourne. At the same
time and place seven hostesses set out bridge
tables to welcome Mrs. C. A. M. Sprigg, re-
turned after a trip to England.
From the City of the Black Swan:
Flowerbeds and lawns were the brightest
points of the vista at headquarters for the 81st
anniversary race meeting. Grey skies and a
wavering barometer curbed the donning of
summer garb and most people kept to near-
spring dress. President Lee Steere’s wife stuck
to her favorite navy blue, and daughter Muriel
punted in Kaffir-brown and biscuit wool de
Chine; Freda Weir’s all-white suit was in velvet
pique; a shimmering black satin coat enveloped
Mrs. Langlois Lefroy; Betty Rosenstamn’s
magpie-striped suit revealed an ochre shirtwaist
topped by a crushed fez contraption in black,
and lima Kitts was a symphony in blues.
St. Aubyn Barrett-Lennard waited at the altar
of St. George’s Cathedral for Betty Simpson,
who came down the aisle in a froth of hail-
spot tulle, which started with a bubble of frills
at the shoulder, cascaded down her sides and
fell into a billow all afoam with spray from
the mist of a tulle veil. Joan Drummond and
Dorothy Ferguson followed in her wake, lesser
waterfalls, sun-glinted, in aurora rays.
Millie Lightly was followed by two train-
bearers, two matrons of honor and three brides-
maids for her nuptials with Joe Monaghan at
St. Mary’s Cathedral. The procession was
peacefully clad in parchment, the bride’s lilies-
of-the-valley being held against classic-cut satin
with a built-in train and a flat bow at back.
The attendants’ threaded networks of lace were
topped by parasol hats of the same weave.
Cottesloe Golf Club draped flags and bunting
around its verandahs, installed a mass of flowers
in its lounges and erected a supper marquee on
the practice putting green for its close-of-the-
season dance. President Wingrove squired his
wife, a silhouette in weblike black lace. Mrs.
Frank Manford’s blaze of Jacob’s-coat color-
ings and windmill organdie sleeves guided a
party of diners from the Brighton Flotel; Dr.
Claude Morlet’s diminutive spouse was on
deck in oatmeal lace; a swirl of beige fur caped
Mrs. Howard Bonner’s parchment satins; Ruth
Clifton was like a Doric column in alabaster
georgettes.
Poster costumes of all sizes and shapes
marched around Government House ballroom
at the Local Products Ball. Decorations were
in keeping with the name of the function and
ingenious devices introduced the State’s colors
in the supper-room. A huge black swan held
central position on the official table and smaller
birds nested near golden water-lilies down the
length of the room. Mrs. E. B. Sinclair’s coral
georgettes occupied the presidential chair, and
Mrs. Orgill did secretarial duties in petunia
Deauville crepe.
Hobart continues to enjoy the society
of the new vice-regal s:
Show day was fine. His Ex. dined with the
committee, and later in the afternoon he and
Lady Clark made their formal entrance to the
ground. They found the livestock and other
exhibits so much to their liking that they had
another peep at them on the last day of the
show. On the big day Miss Macdonald (Bris-
bane), a guest at Government House, was with
Lady Clark, and the v.-r. party also included
knight Elliott Lewis and his lady and Nicholls,
C.J., and his lady.
The women’s industrial section at the show,
opened by Lady Clark, demonstrated that the
modern woman can hold her own with her
granny when it comes to using the needle and
the cooking-pot.
His Ex. and Lady Clark attended the Toe H
Ball in the City Hall. Chief engineers of the
jollo were Mrs. D. C. McLaren, Mrs. Wishart
Smith and Major Echlin. The stage was turned
into a supper-room, the tables massed with Ice-
land poppies.
There was a brave display of white sails
and trim vessels at the opening of the yacht-
ing season on the Derwent, which happened
on a grey day. His Ex. and Lady Clark were .
on board the launch Egeria. Sir Ernest is a
yachtsman, and was keenly interested. Little
speedboats dashed about impudently among the
dignified sailing-craft. The number of boats
out was much larger than usual, the Royal
Yacht Club, Derwent Sailing Squadron, Bel-
lerive Yacht Club and Motor Yacht Club all
being represented.
Colin Pitt, maker of the West Coast-road,
a piece of engineering which gained him the
0.8. E., was invested with the honor by his
Ex. at Government House. Members of both
Houses of Parliament and several friends and
relatives of the recipient were entertained at
morning tea before the investiture.
The races at Elwick drew a good crowd,
though the weather was not on its best behavior.
Chairman A. J. Miller and his wife entertained
guests in the pavilion, where tables were bright
with Iceland poppies in all shades. Mrs. Miller
wore a navy wool crepe ensemble and small
hat to match. Sybil Lyons, just back from
California, received greetings in black and
white.
Gwen Courthope, daughter of the late W. E.
and Mrs. Courthope, Sandy Bay, and Geoff.
Edgell, son of the B. H. Edgells, Bothwell,

lust ordinary caution makes the Dunlop
"Gold Seal" your logical choice when fitting
new tyres For it is the safest tyre —both
inside and out. Inside there is the safety of
its blowout-resisting casing of High Tensile
Cord. Outside, the full width of the famous
Dunlop helical tread holds the road with a
positive, geared grip. This means instant
braking, full power transmission and no slips
or skids on wet or greasy surfaces. In addi-
tion to safety, Dunlop "Gold Seal” gives
greater mileage—a whisper-free silence and
more comfort. See your local dealer. Today’s
Dunlop prices are lower than ever before.
■sidewall buttresses
The Dunlop tread design doesn't waste an inch
of road grip. On ordinary surfaces it holds from
shoulder to shoulder. In soft surfaces the side •
wall buttresses give the extra grip that brings a
Dunlop through where other tyres sink in and bog.

The Cheat.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
ON Christmas Day, 1860, Mr. George
Lane-Greene gave a picnic on
Clark Island that was long remem-
bered in Sydney.
There were still old people alive who
could recall the entertainment of Gover-
nor and Mrs. Macquarie by Captain
Piper when he warmed the mansion he
had built on the point that was to be
distinguished by his patronymic, and
named it Elizabeth Henrietta House after
his Excellency’s gracious lady. Less
hoary veterans were able to speak of the
occasion when Mr. Wentworth had
roasted an ox at Vaucluse in celebration
of the departure for England of the un-
popular Governor Darling. But no one
could call to mind anything more gor-
geous than the alfresco festival which
Mr. Lane-Greene tendered to the nobility
and gentry of Sydney to mark his im-
pending departure from Australia with
the fortune that the country had gener-
ously bestowed upon him.
Mr. Lane-Greene —portly, white-waist-
coated, pink-faced and Eminently Re-
spectable—was the ideal host. Bachelor,
sportsman to his finger-tips, liberal em-
ployer, he was essentially a popular figure
in an era which worshipped Respectability
as much as Sportsmanship. Hj had but
one enemy, and nobody on this side of the
world could have supposed it possible
for such a person to exist. But he did
exist, and was waiting in London for
Mr. Lane-Greene, with venom in his
heart and deadly purpose in his mind.
“Our admirable and invaluabje host!
said the Mayor. “I cannot think what
« e . wil J, d ? withou ! bim
harbo , r , 'i’, e wave , d '"(TaTS
oVer the blue Waters of Port Jackson—
“will miss him. The Legislative Council

.« *- « * ’ c r \
the Mechanics School of Arts, the City
Council, the Synod-ladies and gentle-
-IT},en; is impossible toi me to mention
tbie spheres in which our friend and
companion will be missed. I give you
tbe toast °f George Lane-Greene, one ot
°4 r r 4 os J : h°J] ore <I citizens and the dear
f n ®?d °f e 4 cb .. aS-
The continued hip-hip-hoorays set the
gobs Hying Irom the top of the g'cen
‘ s j et, T ant be^®w ! n B announcement o
Mr. Lane-Greene s jolly good fellowship
echoed J om P° ln l Piper and from
Bradley s Head.
. If the expressed judgment of his
fellow-men as to his qualities and his
worth could have wafted him to Heaven
Mr. Lane-Greene would have arrived
there in less than no time. However, the
grateful recollection ot it carried him
round the Horn, and across the South
Atlantic, and up the Channel and the
Thames into London Docks, so that he
almost looked for the Lord Mayor to
be awaiting him on the dingy quay when
the Duncan Dunbar berthed on a
glorious April forenoon. But although
the Right Honorable wasn’t there, some-
one else was. This person took a close
view of the distinguished passenger, spat
with loathing into the pea-soup waters of
the dock, and departed.
Mr. George Lane-Greene hadn't a
notion that such a welcome had been
extended to him. Liberally he tipped the
stewards and the cook, graciously he
shook hands with the captain and the
mate ; then he drove away in a four-
wheeler to Morley’s Hotel in Trafalgar
Square. The Nelson Column and Land-
seer’s lions were new to him —they had
not been erected when he ran away from
London in 1825, very glad to get out of
the place.
On the-evening of his arrival he was
seated in the smoking-room after dinner
when a waiter brought him a card upon
a tray. His face changed from its usual
healthy pink to a sickly sallowness as he
read the name.
“Lord!” he gasped, holding the piece
of pasteboard by a corner, as if it burned
his fingers —“what the devil!”
“Gennleman’s a-waitin’ in th’ ’all, sir,”
the waiter said. “Says ’e’s partic’lar
bus’ness with you, sir.; Shall 1 show him
hin?” .
Mr. Lane-Greene had changed in a
moment from the personification of
mature and dignified well-being into a
pale and faltering caricature of manhood
—one who shrank from a blow that he
knew to be inevitable. The phlegmatic
Cockney holding the tray could only
think he had been smitten with one of
those awful visitations vaguely alluded
to as “a stroke.”
“Shall 1 get you a brandy-and-soda?”
“Listen, waiter,” falteringly whispered
Mr. Lane-Greene. “Is there a way out
of this room —out of it, 1 mean, without
going through the hall? It is inconveni-
ent — very inconvenient, just now for me
to see this gentleman. Can I find a way
out without meeting him?”
“Hi fear not, sir. This ’ere’s th’ on’y
door. But ’ere’s th’ gennleman ’isself, sir,
a-waitin’ in th’ door. Thank you, sir.
Please to ring hif you require anythink,
sir—Hi’ll be in th’ ’all.”
He bowed himself back, making way
for the tall and somewhat grim-looking
visitor who stared at Mr. Lane-Greene.
The latter turned round —it was rather
shuffling than turning—and abjectly con-
fronted the newcomer.
“You, sir—you—you wish to see me?”
he croaked in a dry voice as unlike the
rich fruitiness of his ordinary tone as
the rasp of a saw is unlike a bar of
music. “I —er —that is to say —I presume
this is your card, sir. Pray —pray, what
may you require of me, sir?”
The stranger stepped into the room
and halted directly in front of Mr. Lane-
Greene, whilst the waiter slipped out of
the room behind him. For a few
moments the visitor stared at the wilting
gentleman before him, saying nothing,
but seeming to search his face with
bright, hard eyes whose mercilessness
was only too frightfully evident to the
victim of their scrutiny. Weakly Mr.
Lane-Greene indicated a chair.
“Won’t you —er —pray, won’t you sit
down, sir?”
“No,” said the stranger, “I won’t.
That is, not here. Have you a private
sitting-room?”
“Er —yes, I have, sir. It is upstairs.”
“Then lead the way to it.”
Without a word, Mr. Lane-Greene,
strangely bent and round-shouldered, did
as he was so uncompromisingly ordered.
Up the broad staircase of the famous old
hostelry his visitor followed him to a
room in the front of the house that
looked out upon Trafalgar Square. They
went into it, and the stranger closed the
door behind him. He turned the key and
put it in his pocket. Mr. Lane-Greene
looked at him furtively, but made no
protest.
“Sit down,” said the stranger.
Mr. Lane-Greene did as he was
ordered.
The stranger was perhaps older in
years than Mr. Lane-Greene, but was a
much younger man actually. He might
have been seventy to Mr. Lane-Greene’s
sixty ; he seemed no more than fifty. His
• body looked as hard as his smooth, stern
face, and, if there is anything in physiog-
nomy, his features indicated a character
as severe as the set of his mouth, the jut-
ting prominence of his bony nose, the
protrusion of his chin and the square-
ness of his jaws explained and demon-
strated. His strong body—spare, angular
and active—was in sharp contrast with
the plump softness of the frightened be-
ing whom he regarded so implacably.
“Well, George,” he said presently;
“they tell me you’ve made excellent use
of the talent or two with which the Devil
entrusted you. I hear that in New South
Wales you’ve had a pretty satisfactory
career. Done remarkably well, in fact.”
Sitting bolt upright in one of the curv-
ing horsehair armchairs of the period,
with his hands on his knees and his top-
hat between his feet, he looked like a
Judge whilst the prisoner is being asked
why sentence of death should not be
passed upon him. And Mr. Lane-Greene
looked as though the prisoner knew there
was nothing to be said. He was silent.
“Ah, well,” the other proceeded ; “that
would be very fine —very fine indeed —
if your destiny were only a little kinder.
But it’s not going to be so, I can tell you.
It’s going to be d d unkind.”
“I—l didn’t know you were in Lon-
don. I didn’t think you were alive.”
“Oh, very much alive, I assure you.
Tasman’s Peninsula, on the whole, has
a very healthful climate, and, although
Port Arthur, as a place of residence,
leaves something to be desired, its inhabi-
tants don’t acquire habits of sloth or of
self-indulgence. They work hard and go
to rest early—two conditions which en-
sure a man’s healthiness, at least. You
knew I was at Port Arthur, George,
didn’t you?”
With his mouth gaping loosely, Mr.
Lane-Greene nodded. The nod was im-
peded by his double-chin.
“You might have come and seen me —
it wouldn’t have taken you long to run
across Bass Strait. But no doubt you
were too fully occupied making your for-
tune to take any interest in this new
science of penology. It is very thor-
oughly understood in Van Diemen’s
Land. What they don’t know about
breaking a man’s spirit isn’t worth know-
ing. But they never quite broke mine,
though one or two tried pretty hard to
do it during the fourteen years I spent
there.”

Mr. Lane-Greene licked his lips
nervously, but did not speak.
“I never lost heart,” the other went on.
“Always felt that some day I would have
my reward. I remember when this up-
lifting mental state first came to me. Tt
was that afternoon in the Old Bailey
when his Lordship whitewashed you so
completely apd—figuratively, of course —
treated me to a coat of tar and feathers.
Very clever you were, George, in putting
it all on to me. But I became pretty
clever myself during those fourteen years.
So here we are together again. I hope
you appreciate that fact.”
“What is it you want? Do —do you
want money? Will you let me alone if —
if I give you half I’ve got?”
Mr. Lane-Greene lifted himself a little
in his armchair and bent forward with
some suggestion of eagerness, as though
he saw a ray of hope. His visitor laughed
quietly.
“I’m going to have, not only half,
George, but all you’ve got. And you’re
going to have a taste of what I’ve had.
I’m told that Western Australia is not
quite such a hard way for transgressors
as the stony road we used to tread in
Van Diemen’s Land. But it will be hard
enough for you. I daresay Fremantle gaol
and the roads you will help to make over
that heavy sand will cause you to realise
that you treated me pretty badly. And
there’ll be no hope for you, George.
You’ll just about live long enough to do
your sentence, and I don’t suppose you’ll
ever come back here to make a nuisance
of yourself. I’ve got everything ready—
the whole business was thought out long
ago. We’ll take a little walk to-night
through London streets —you’ll like the
look of them after your long absence
down under. Not very far —only to my
house in Bloomsbury.”
“Look —look here.” Mr. Lane-Greene
put his hands on the knobs of his arm-
chair. “Why—why should I listen to a
word you say? I’ve only to ring the bell
and I can have you thrown out into the
street. Damme, I’ve no reason to fear
you, Malone. I’ll do it! I’ll have you
put out. You —you’re only a black-
mailer.”
He rose unsteadily to his feet. His
visitor rose also. With a gulp of fear
Mr. Lane-Greene realised that his perse-
cutor held a small single-barrelled pistol
in his right and that the round hole
in the end of its muzzle was pointing
into the middle of his waistcoat. He sat
down suddenly, took out a silk handker-
chief, and mopped his moist forehead.
“I anticipated a little resistance —or, at
any rate, a show of it. But I think you’ll
come quietly. Where’s your hat?”
“In my bedroom.”
“That door leads into your bedroom?”
Mr. Lane-Greene nodded.
“Well, we’ll get the hat, and then you
will lead the way downstairs. But re-
member, you must not walk more than
four feet in front of me, and when we
are out in the street you will keep on
my left-hand side. Forget these things
and try to make a scene, and I’ll shoot
you at once. You are not going to
escape. Come, now —the hat. We’d bet-
ter get the business over.”
“But—but look here! How are you
going to send me to Western Australia,
and what d’ye mean by saying you’re
going to have all I’ve got?”
“When you come to my house you
will sign some papers, and after that you
will remain there quietly for a month.
Then you will commit a crime which will
ensure you at least seven years’ trans-
portation. You will have to commit it,
and it will be a real crime. I’ve arranged
for witnesses, and all that. There isn’t a
single detail I haven’t considered. The
scheme is perfect. Now, you just walk
into the bedroom and get your hat and
overcoat, and remember I’m just behind
you.”
Wearily and abjectly, Mr. Lane-Greene
shuffled across the room into his bed-
chamber. Close behind, the little pistol
in his hand, went his captor.
Past the church of St. Martin’s-le-
Grand they made their way into Long-
acre, and slowly progressed towards
Oxford-street through byways with
which the tall thin man seemed familiar.
Always he walked close to Mr. Lane-
Greene, his left arm pressed against his
companion’s right, whilst the other rested
across his breast, the small pistol con-
cealed beneath his left armpit.
“You’ve got over all that sort of thing,
George, I suppose?” once remarked
Malone as they passed a rather good-
looking woman who made eyes at them
from beneath a gas-lamp. “I know you’re
not married, of course. In fact, there’s
very little I don’t know about you and
your habits. I could afford to pay well
to have you watched in Sydney. All your
doings I was well acquainted with—
largely owing to the zeal of your man-
servant, Mr. James Dalhunty, who is
faithful to his own pocket. Yes, I knew
your private life was blameless enough.
Well, but for the one thing that is going
to earn you your passage back to Aus-
tralia —I wish it were Van Diemen’s
Land—your future life will be blameless
enough, too. You won’t give warders or
overseers any trouble —I’m sure of that.
You’ll be too frightened to be ill-
behaved.”
Presently they came out into Oxford-
street, and the hurrying pedestrians be-
came more numerous. As they passed a
dark passage, Mr. Lane-Greene had a
sudden impulse to dive into its blackness
and trust to luck. But he felt the end of
the pistol barrel poked savagely into his
•ribs through the folds of fat flesh below
his right arm, and his teeth chattered
with fear. But, suddenly and unex-
pectedly, he got his chance, and all his
terrors momentarily deserted him. If he
could only get clear of this close contact
with his escort he might cast himself
upon the protection of a policeman.
That was his only hope.
A sudden rush of running men and
boys surged down the footpath, jostling
them apart. Mr. Lane-Greene jumped
across the gutter into the roadway, and
saw that the hurrying crowd had pushed
his companion into a doorway and that
he was covered by more than one body
from the danger of a pistol-shot. He
began to run across the street.
There was a roar of shouting voices
and the noise of galloping hooves close
beside him, and he was aware that people
were hastening out of the roadway on to
the pavements —flying for their lives. He
hesitated and looked up as the galloping
white horse bore down upon his shrink-
ing figure.
“Hi! Hi! Hi!” yelled the brass-
helmeted men on the bounding fire-
engine. “<9/z, my God!” shouted the
driver as he saw the fat man go down
beneath the pole, and then felt the heavy
engine lurch as it passed over him.
Mr. Malone pushed his way through
the throng and looked down at the white
and flabby face of the dead man on
the macadam. A big policeman who had
been stooping over the body of the fire-
engine’s victim straightened up.
“Pore feller’s dead!” he informed the
crowd.
Bitterly Mr. Thomas Malone turned
away.
“The damned cheat!” he snarled.
I Dreamed I Heard the Grasses
Grow.
I dreamed I heard the grasses grow.
A small, sweet sound it was, as though
A wind blew faint
On airy strings,
And moved
A multitude of tiny wings.
Soft, secret things I heard —the sigh
Of petals poised on little stems;
The ghostly swish of lifted grass,
As though a woman wandered by
With whispering hems
And the thin, crystal sound of rain
Through quivering shoots,
And twisted roots,
Like violins in love with pain.
I dreamed 1 heard the grasses grow,
While all the night was listening.
1 woke and stirred.
And lo!
I heard
A cuckoo piping in the spring!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Visitants.
Above the broad suburban street
The moon hangs, round and white;
No sound of wheels or passing feet
Breaks through the calm of night.
A roaming thing ’neath stirless things,
Come far from moonlit seas;
A wakeful wind on velvet wings
Moves through the laurel-trees.
Who knows what tales it brings, what news
Of regions strange and fair?
From gardens washed by heavy dews
Sweet odors scent the air.
No song is heard, no midnight tune
Thrills through the silence wide;
Dark shadows, banished by the moon,
In dim recesses hide.
Oh, who are these that, breathing sighs
And swaying evermore,
With downcast heads and haunted eyes
Go in and out each door?
The cypress knows them as they pass,
The lily bows its head;
They leave no print upon the grass,
As to and fro they tread.
They walk the halls, they climb the stairs,
They scowl, they sigh, they weep.
Whence come they, and what task is theirs?
What tryst is it they keep?
While sleep tired age and youth o’erwhelms,
Beside each couch they bide:
They are pale visitants from realms
That know not time nor tide.
’Neath drooping veils, with heads bowed low,
More pallid than the gleams
Of yon high moon, they come and go,
The mystic host of dreams.

Grievance.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
IN the days when I wore a hat, I
became acquainted with John Farrell:
Hats Renovated, Umbrellas Repaired,
Clothes Pressed and Cleaned.
Somebody had given me a yarn about
Farrell, which I had written and had pub-
lished. I was rather dismayed when I
found myself being introduced to him
as the author; he might have been
offended. Actually he was so delighted
that he bought drinks in a lavish manner
and looked for other means of expressing
his gratitude. And he saw my hat.
Never in my life have I been able to
develop any reverential feelings about a
hat. To me it is merely something to be
lifted when meeting ladies of one’s
acquaintance, during the singing of “God
Save” or when funerals pass ; something
to be blown off by wild winds and there-
after folded up and carried ; to be sat
upon sometimes in places where fears of
losing it are justifiable ; convenient occa-
sionally as a pillow, or even as a beer
wrap when a bottle needs to be dis-
guised.
Farrell looked at my dilapidated felt
and said his foreman, Harry Beeston,
could work a change in it that would
surprise me. He was obviously very
proud of possessing Harry Beeston, and
with good reason. Harry Beeston did
the job so well that at the sight of
my transformed cady the eyes of credi-
tors gleamed with hope, street cadgers
gave me special attention and an old
friend flattered me by asking if I could
lend him a fiver.
When I had written another paragraph
about the hat-renovating foreman’s enthu-
siasm for growing pansies, I became
definitely persona grata with the John
Farrell concern. My hats, after being
sat upon several times, quickly fell into
disrepair again ; and I lived in constant
danger of meeting either Farrell or his
foreman and being hustled to the work-
shop to have my headgear restored,
gratis, to respectability.
To Harry Beeston hats were an Art.
He had been apprenticed to the trade
for seven years, he told me, adding “I am
still learning.” As for Farrell, he frankly
admitted that Beeston was the soul of his
business. In his pride he had written to
the Prince of Wales, when H.R.H. was
in Sydney, beseeching an opportunity to
show what Australian workmanship
could do in the way of restoring hats.
A framed letter on the wall testified that
the heir apparent was truly astonished
at the workmanship.
“A man who recognises the quality
of a hat like that,” said Beeston, as he
proudly showed the royal testimonial, “is
worthy to be King.”
The little hat-for’eman with the long
furrow of baldness running through
hedges of hair to the back of his head
was one of the outstandingly happy men
of my acquaintance. Hats like mine, I
found, were a particular joy to him, since
he could show what he could do with
them. He went home after his days of
artistic triumph, and two beers for a
finish, to his family on four nights in the
week ; on the fifth the family came to
him, and they went to the pictures.
There were triumphs at home, too. I
have mentioned his pansies; he had
evolved several new varieties. And he
cherished the hope that young Harry
would some day be as good a hat-reno-
vator as his father.
John Farrell died suddenly. The first I
knew of it was when Beeston, his eyes
red —there had been a real friendship
between them —met me in the street and
insisted upon taking me to the closed
workshop and furbishing up my hat for
the funeral—which, incidentally, I did not
attend. I will have to attend my own
funeral, of course ; I keep away, as far
as possible, from others.
Farrell left the business to Beeston,
with a proviso that it should be carried
on in the old name. That strange long-
ing for posthumous fame that is in all
men’s bosoms had taken this form ; as
long as there was a hat-renovating busi-
ness in Sydney the name of John Farrell
would not be forgotten.
“Jack knew he could trust me,” said
Beeston proudly. “He knew that I would
never let the name of John Farrell down.”
It was a rich gift really ; the concern
made those extraordinary profits that
some small businesses often do; and
Beeston evinced a natural pride at his
leap from a position as a mere paid (if
important) employee to that of employer.
It was not until some months had
passed that I realised that things were
not going well.
The fact that Beeston should be met
in a bar in the morning, clad in purple
and fine linen that looked altogether too
new for comfort, showed how he had
altered his way of life —leaving the work
of which he had been so proud to the
people he paid to do it.
“It’s not a fair thing,” he said to me
privily, having conducted me into the
group with which he was drinking, when
I had asked how the Farrell concern was
faring. “It was my work, really, that
made the business; it’s my work that
keeps it going. But when a man ex-
hibits a hat I have made better than new,
he doesn’t say Harry Beeston did it; he
says John Farrell did.”
“Take thou the gains, and let the credit
pass,” 1 laughed.
“It’s no laughing matter!” he retorted.
“I’m an artist, as it were ; and an artist
thinks of more than the profit. I’m
working for the fame of a dead man ;
I’m getting none for myself.”
It was astonishing. Previously no mean
streak had been discernible in the happy
little man who had been hat-renovating
foreman. Now he was envious of the
dead, whose testamentary generosity had
placed him in Easy Street.
“How are the pansies?” I asked, to
get to more agreeable subjects.
“Great!” he answered. “This year I’ll
have a variety which will be as near to
a real black as it is possible to get.”
“That’s fine,” I said.
“I was thinking of calling it John
Farrell, after the old boss,” he went on
with a flash of his old enthusiasm. “But
I don’t know about that, now. Seems
to me I’ve been working all my life —I’ve
been years on this pansy—making names
for other people. I haven’t so much time
for gardening, now; I’ve got a man
looking after the place ; and as I might
not produce anything like this again 1
might as well think of my own name as
Farrell’s. Jack was a bit selfish, you
know.
“I’ve a good mind to sell out,” he
added. “ I could carry the whole con-
nection over to a business in my own
name.”
“Don’t be silly,” I advised. “You'd
be foolish to try any monkey tricks with
a trade like that.”
“A man wants to feel that his business
is his own,” he grumbled.
It was a real grievance. Whether the
alteration in his family life assisted the
growth I could not say definitely ; but
that had certainly altered.
Beeston got me to draft out a para-
graph he wanted to have inserted in the
evening paper about some social activity
his wife had undertaken. Young Harry,
it appeared, had gone to Burlington
College.
“The wife thinks of making a parson
of him,” Beeston explained. Less than
a year ago he had been talking, almost
with excitement, of his son’s coming
apprenticeship to the hat business.
I met Beeston at a city club that same
night. The happy Friday evening family
outings must be things of the past. I
was strangely sorry at the discovery. In
a short meeting Beeston’s grievance was
annoyingly in evidence. It had evidently
taken possession of his mind. He was
not the agreeable fellow to meet that he
had been.
He had something of his old, almost
boyish excitement when he told me that
he had arranged to sell the John Farrell
business, name and all. Without waiting
for the final settlement he had put up
his own shingle.
He was full of confidence, full of a
renewed enthusiasm for his art. The
idea that he would be working for his
own name appeared to give a rebirth to
his zeal.
Bit by bit I learned of his difficulties.
He had disposed of the John Farrell
business on a small deposit, retaining
the right to set up for himself ; the pur-
chaser, becoming scared, decided not to
go on. Beeston, it transpired, had
been depending upon the purchase-money
to assist his new concern. There was no-
thing surprising in learning that, with
the birth of social ambitions in his wife,
he was not so well off as when he had
been Farrell’s head man.
Embarrassed by the hitch in his
arrangements, Beeston got rid of the
John Farrell establishment for a fraction
of its value. Fred Small, an investor, the
merriest of souls in company, bought
it. Small knew nothing about hat-reno-
vating, but he knew a lot about business.
Beeston, who knew a lot about hat-
renovating and nothing about business,
found himself hit by a price war. Small,
who had capital to spare, was willing to
put more of it at the back of his pur-
chase-money to crush out opposition.
Even so, perhaps, he did not run the

Carry a Letter of Credit
The simplest and safest way to finance a trip to any
part of Australia or to any place abroad is to carry
a Bank of New South Wales’ Letter of Credit.
This method eliminates the risk of theft that is
always present when large sums in cash are carried
on the person.
The Bank issues with each Letter of Credit a letter
of introduction, which bears the traveller’s signature,
and provides identification.
There is an agent of the Bank of New South Wales

show at a loss, although a temporary loss
would be nothing to him.
. “He can’t put in good work at the
prices,” Beeston told me bitterly. “He’s
simply rushing the work out, killing the
John Farrell name.”
“Well, that’s all the better for you,
isn’t it? The customers, if they’re dis-
satisfied, will come to you.”
“But so many of them don’t notice.
As long as a hat is renovated, they
don’t seem to care whether the job is
done properly or not,” he said, very
much like a deeply religious man talking
about the insincerity of other people’s re-
ligion. “I’d sooner cut my throat than
turn out some of the work they’re doing
at Farrell’s'.”
In a casual way I discovered that
Beeston was being hit by other influences.
Hillier remarked on the state of his hat,
which had been flung off his head into
the muddy road by a strong wind. “I’ll
have to take it to John Farrell’s,” he
said.
“What about Harry Beeston?” I asked.
“I’ve had my hats done at Farrell’s
ever since I remember,” he said.
“They’ve always given satisfaction.”
“But Beeston was Farrell’s.”
“Can’t help it; I like the old firm,”
said Hillier.
Beeston had not calculated upon that
human characteristic when he had broken
from his old moorings.
In bitterness of spirit he cut his
prices, although he clung, even in that
predicament, to the feeling that his work
was an art and had to be treated as such.
Small’s retort was a further cut.
It was not until I read of the pre-
divorce alimony application of Mrs.
Beeston that I realised how far Beeston’s
domestic happiness had vanished in the
changed circumstances his grievance had
produced. It was easy enough to divine
what had happened ; lack of understand-
ing of her husband’s difficulties on the
part of a wife, moved late in life by the
desire to cut a figure in society, had
led to incessant quarrels. The lady
I remembered regretfully as a clinging
and worshipping spouse had her point
of view. She felt exasperation, no doubt,
at the motives, quite unintelligible to her,
which had created the difficulties.
Yet it was hard on Beeston. Especially
as Small could afford to laugh at the
efforts of the desperate little hat-artist to
compete with him.
In my pity for Beeston I, who didn’t
care tuppence about how a hat looked,
took one along to him and insisted upon
paying for the work done to it. It was
rather surprising to find him accepting
the payment eagerly; but he insisted
upon buying drinks.
“I’m broke,” he said. “I can’t carry
on even another couple of months. I’ve
had to owe everybody to keep up those
payments to the wife —blast her! No,
1 don’t mean that; but I couldn’t stand
that woman’s nagging.”
No use talking about pansies to him
now. He had let all that go. Yet, even
as he spoke gloomily about his impend-
ing ruin, it seemed to me that matters
were not so black as he thought them.
“There’s one thing,” I told him ; “an
expert like yourself can always get a
job.”
“A job /” He almost shouted it. His
expression seemed savage. It is very
hard for any of us to go back.
When next I met Beeston he was
down. His plant had been seized ; his
examination in the Bankruptcy Court was
listed. When I asked him to have a
drink he accepted with the eagerness of
one who had the longing in his throat
and nothing in his pocket with which
to gratify it.
“They’ve beaten me,” he said. His
hand thumped upon a small bulge over
his hip. “There’s always a way out;
but if I go I’ll see that swine Small goes
with me.”
I reasoned with him chaffingly, trying
to make his violent thoughts appear
ludicrous. But when I left him I was
haunted by the tigerish lines on his now
worn face and the glint in his eyes.
Grievance had made him dangerous,
I felt sure. One does not rush to the
police with alarming news of every mur-
derous threat one hears ; yet whenever I
thought of Beeston —and the thought
haunted me —I felt uncomfortable. I
thought, too, of Small, always with the
vision of him falling, hand pressed to
his heart, the habitual laugh frozen out
of his face.
It was tragical how what should have
been a stroke of good fortune had con-
verted a man in every circumstance
happy into the desperate, ruined hater
that poor Harry Beeston had become. I
was so worried about him that I went out
of my way to meet him next day. Al-
most with the greeting, he vented a burst
of invective against Small.
With the bitterness of it on my mind
and the knowledge that the little bulge
was again on his hip, my blood froze
when, as we entered a bar, I saw Small
stride towards us.
My nerves were tense, prepared for a
leap if Beeston’s hand wandered towards
his hip. But for the moment he seemed
stunned at the friendliness of Small.
“You’re going to have a drink with
me —two drinks!” cried that person
heartily. “Men can fight and still be
friends, can’t they? Better friends, per-
haps, for fighting. Two of my best
friends are fellows who bested me in a
deal. And, after all, Beeston, you’re the
man who’s won in our little affair.”
It was a strange statement to make.
It sounded so much like a taunt that I
thought Beeston would take it as one.
“It’s a fact,” Small proceeded. “John
Farrell’s business is settled, as far as I’m
concerned. It needs a man who can look
after the renovating part and make its
reputation what it used to be. I’ve
wanted to get you back in the factory.
Decided in the end that I would get
you back. But didn’t know where to find
you, so I went out to your home.”
“I’m not living at home,” said Beeston.
“I didn’t know,” said Small. .“How-
ever, I saw Mrs. B. She seemed to be
worried about you; but when I told her
that there was a job as manager at John
Farrell’s, and a partnership if you liked,
she seemed happy.”
“You mean” Beeston choked. He
was flabbergasted.
“I want to get that blasted business off
my mind, with someone I can trust to
look after it. Got other fish to fry,” said
Small cordially. “If you’re willing, the
sooner we talk terms the better. 1 want
to strike a bargain this very day if I can.
No haggling, Harry, between you and
me. Are you on?”
For a moment I thought that in the
perversity that grievance breeds in some
men Beeston was going to refuse to
negotiate. When I saw him take the
heartily extended hand I knew that the
obsession which so nearly destroyed him
had been removed from his mind for
ever.
“You’re going back to John Farrell’s,
old man,” said that big-hearted commer-
cial pirate Small. “Your first job will be
to renovate this bird’s hat—and his other
hat, if he has another. Name your poi-
sons again, lads, and we’ll drink success
to John Farrell’s under the new-old
management.”
I Draw Anear You in Your Sleeping
City.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city,
And like far waters falling
My voice to you is heard,
As lone upon the night as that lost calling,
When, as his hidden word,
The lion, passion-stirred,
Looses against the sky
The languors of his cry.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city,
Where, with its lanterns burning.
It seems to veil apart
In misted light your sleep, toward which,
with yearning,
Even as o’er the waste
The mourning plovers haste,
Leaps my impatient heart
To be to yours a dart.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city,
Moving as one imprisoned,
And, yet, as one in whom
The captured as the conqueror is visioned ;
For in my hollow hand
Your feet will one day stand—
Yea, for love to the tomb
Has webbed us in one loom!
I draw anear you in your sleeping city.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city,
All night toward you riding,
Who watched Orion lift
On high his sword, and marked the deep
abiding
Of Arcturus in flame,
As though he brought to shame
The Galaxy’s pale drift,
The Twain-Star’s dark unthrift.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city.
1 draw anear you in your sleeping city,
All night towards you moving :
And as I rode there broke
The long, long cry of all my life’s behoving,
That rose against what cost
Of living hours —so lost!
Since there was none bespoke
My heart till you it woke.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city
As shipwreck draws toward its shore.
The night-wind faints upon the distant hills;
Ebon the house-made shadows lie, as though
Came never dawn upon the silver sills
Of heaven with amber glow.
I draw anear you in your sleeping city;
Now am I at your gate, my hand upon’ your
door.

Human Rust primary
cause of 95 of
present-day sicKness
.. . explains Consulting Physician of
Buda Pesth
Dr. EMIL LEVAI
JUST as rust coats a water pipe, so through faulty
bowel action fragments of food waste become
encrusted on the walls of the intestine. This waste
matter is “human rust.” In it breed germs and
poisons which enter the blood stream, leading to
dreaded self-poisoning (autoxima). Self-poisoning,
the result of “human rust,” is responsible for most
of the ill-health which afflicts modern men and
women.
Clear “Human Rust” with
Coloseptic
You can clear from your system the virulent poisons
that undermine health and sap vitality. You can
banish constipation, headache, gas in the bowels and
stomach, catarrh, backache, rheumatism, neuritis, and
all the hosts of ailments that come from self-poison-
ing. Take COLOSEPTIC. It first loosens and
dissolves, then smoothly washes out the decaying
waste. It rids the body of all poisons and blood
impurities through Nature’s four outlets —the large
intestine —the kidneys—the pores of the skin —and
the respiratory organs.
Regain Your Youthful Vigour .
Every morning take COLOSEPTIC in hot water.
COLOSEPTIC actually “tones” and cleanses your
entire digestive tract —helps your body throw off
its waste matter regularly. No longer are you
depressed, tired without cause, subject to headaches
and colds. Your pulse leaps to the thrills of life —
your old vim and vigour return. Aches, pains, and
ailments vanish for ever.

Sea Voices.
BY RODERIC QUINN.
RECENTLY towards midnight I
awoke to hear the sound of break-
ing waves. Low, insistent and ever-
even, it stole up to my room over a
mile of streets and lanes from the sands
and rocks of Bondi and Tamarama.
Through my open window I could see
that the sky was starless, and as full con-
sciousness came to me I realised that save
for the rumble of a distant tram, bearing
late folk from the city homewards, all
else but the articulate sea was silent.
Listening to that sound it somehow
seemed to me that I did not wish to fall
asleep again, but only to lie at ease and
think, to let one’s thoughts wander where
they pleased. With me lying warm abed
they straightway trooped back to the first
long-ago night on which I heard Bondi
roaring.
I lived then in a long, low, weather-
board house situated between a gaol and
a hospital. The house stood in a fair
green field, surrounded by tall trees. The
house no longer stands there. The
ground on which it stood is now a public
park, and the gaol over the way from it
has become a college. Thus much has
happened since as a child waking in the
darkness on the heights of Darlinghurst
I first heard Bondi roaring.
At that time, judging by its voice, the
sea seemed very much nearer to me than
it does now, though then I dwelt miles
away from the coast, whereas now I live
within a half-hour’s easy stroll of it.
Roar as it might after the wildest of
storms, the waves breaking on beach and
cliff would now be inaudible to the
keenest of ears of one living on the
heights of Darlinghurst. This will be
understood by anyone who pauses to
think that the green, leafy medium of
smokeless, noiseless air through which
the sea sent its sounds in those far-off
days no longer exists, and that those
sounds, losing their way among streets
and alleys, are downed and drowned by
man-made tumult.
Now in that long, low, weatherboard
house, waking as a child in the night,
it was not the sea only that I heard. There
was, for instance, the chorusing of
crickets singing in the darkness, singing
without pause, ceasing not to sing even
when the warders from their watch-
houses on the near-by gaol walls called
the hours, telling each to each that all was
well within those walls.
“Twelve o’clock and all’s well! ”
I remember how, as hour succeeded
hour, I used to lie and shiver, lost in
wonder, dreaming that strange things
were happening in the world outside —
strange, dark things that would shame
and shock the light if they happened by
day —when I heard that call go up;
heard it solemnly voiced and repeated-
now close at hand, now in the distance,
now remotely sounding. But r always
when it died away, bringing me back to
the sweet things of earth, I heard the
crickets singing.
I recall that once, when they sang as
a great host, I threw my blankets aside
and got out of bed and went stealthily
out into the night, thinking to find out
what it was that made them so voiceful.
A late moon was shining whitely, and it
occurred to me that maybe it was her
light that was inspiring them. Not only
were the crickets singing but, also, there
was a heavy scent of honeysuckle on the
air. Very pleasant was that honeysuckle
perfume, and strangely thrilling it was to
be out there in the night all alone. In
such a scene, at such an hour, anything
might happen.
Walking to the garden gate I softly
opened it and looked across the road
towards the gaol. On the bright foot-
path opposite, her face turned to the tall
stone wall of the gaol, stood a woman.
At the sight of her I lost all thought of
the crickets and the honeysuckle.
She wore a cloak and a veil, both very
black in the white light. Her head was
thrown back, her face uplifted, and it
seemed to me that her hands were joined
in prayer. She seemed very strange and
very lonely standing there with hands
and face upraised. Not liking the sight
of her at all I drew back, and was clos-
ing the gate when a voice called out
above her:
“One o’clock and all’s well.”
Seven hours afterwards they hanged
a man in the very gaol before which that
woman stood with such strange appeal
in her attitude.
* * * *
Low, insistent and ever-even sounded
the waves breaking at midnight on the
rocks and sands of Tamarama and Bondi.
Because of the character of their appeal
I knew that no wind was harrying them,
but that they were sent in by a sea which
was returning to the coast from which
it had been driven by a recent westerly
gale. Had a wind been at work on them
theirs would have been a subdued roar,
intervalled by notes of clamor and
tumult; for the many-mooded sea has
many voices, and for those who love the
elemental every voice has a message.
Warm abed in my room on the heights
of Bondi, I recalled many days and
nights of thrilling and delightful asso-
ciation with it. Memories of days spent
on the harbor, on salt-lakes and on
almost-landlocked waters flocked back
on me, making me forget that slumber
was good and should not be denied its
appointed hours. Memories, too, were
mine of nights when, greatly venturing
with other urchins of a like age and a
like mind, I sought out some cave on the
coast, and there cowered over a fire of
grass-tree root and tea-tree limb, talking
of strange things, listening to the wash
of the waves, and ever and anon peering
out into the darkness, half-hoping and
half-fearing to catch a glimpse of Big
Ben.
Yet, peer as we would, such a glimpse
was denied us. Much would have been
our glory if it had been vouchsafed us,
much fine food for after talk among our
fellows, for Big Ben, like some Old-World
legend of werewolf or Black Huntsman,
was reputed amongst the youth of the
waterside to be the most savage monster
that ever roamed the coastal seas —a
great, grey shark, renowned for his cun-
ning and ferocity. It may be that Big
Ben was but a creature of the imagina-
tion, but with us the very mention of him
made the flesh creep and the blood grow
c fiiH
Less than an hour’s journey from the
Quay lived a fisherman whom I visited
frequently. Like many fishermen, he was
wise in the ways of sea and wind, but he
was wiser than most because he was
nearer to Nature than most, having the
blood of the aboriginal in his veins ;
blood which, in spite of his white grand-
father and father, still held cells in it

He knew by the feel of the water and
the sound of the sea what the weather
would be like on the following day, or
before the following day should come to
dawn. He knew, also, what fish to expect
at certain seasons and at certain phases
of the changeful moon, and what shoals
the sea in a generous mood would send

His home, a two-roomed hut, tin-walled,

to see. Always, daily and nightly, some-
thing that appealed to him as of more
than passing moment was happening.
Sometimes it was a rolling, rollicking
school of porpoises that he saw ; some-
times a flock of silver gulls skimming over
the surface of the cove in pursuit of a
swarm of fish that moved swiftly through
the undertide.
One night a shoal of sharks filled the
underwaters with lines and curves of
silver fire as, darting here and there, the\
played havoc with a school of mackerel,
and one night he could not sleep for tne
snorting and splashing made by a strayed
whale at the mouth of the cove. rsu
stranger even than were some o
his experiences.
Once as we idled together, watching
a streaked and yeasty sea that rolled land-
ward before a nor’-east wind, pointing to
a long reef that lay low to the north-
ward, he told me that it was haunted,

“Yes,” he answered gravely, “but not

“Haunted by what?”

Magnified Section of
Threaded Rubber Insulator .
Porosity simply means free flow
of the battery acid between each
positive and negative plate. Illus-
tration above shows the threads
which carry the acid through.
There are 5,000 of these wicks to
the square inch in the Willard
Thread Rubber Insulator! Prac-
tically 85% of battery faults are
due to the premature failure of
conventional insulators. Use a
Willard Thread Rubber Battery.
Only the Willard
Threaded Rubber Insulator
gives such Porosity*
That’s why you get quicker starts and longer life with a
Willard Thread Rubber Battery!
The battery insulator must separate each positive and negative plate . . •
yet allow the very freest chemical action between the plates.
Just how well the insulators do this, determines the performance and
life of the battery!
The illustration above shows how very quickly and freely the acids flow
through the Patented Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator. It is almost
instantaneous! This means that the battery’s maximum power supply is
always ready . . . quicker starts under all conditions for you!
This insulation also gives the Willard Thread Rubber Battery longer
life, because these thread rubber separators actually outlive the plates!
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy. You’ll
get quicker starts under all conditions longer life and your upkeep
will be less! Ask your dealer about the Willard Thread Rubber Battery.
No Wood in a Willard
Thread Rubber Battery!
Hard usage, vibration, and the
result of overcharging often
wear out wooden insulators
before the battery plates have
been used up. This is the
most common fault of battery
failure. Insure yourself with
a Willard Thread Rubber
Battery. More W'illards are
sold than any other make!
