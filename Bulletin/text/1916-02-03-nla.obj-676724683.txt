The Red Page
The Drama
A marvellous simplicity is the keynote of
The Honey stickle, a play by the Italian poet,
Gabriele D'Annunzio (Heinemann, per Dy-
m ode's .Library, Sydney). The play, begin-
ning in a pensive and melancholy beauty,
moves serenely to a strange tragedy. Its
heroine, Aude, is almost a female Hamlet.
Her- mother has married again, and to the
deafer whom Aude suspects of having mur-
Sfrcu her father. But she is afraid; she
wants Ao"' run away and leave the dreadful
past behind her. But Fate is too strong for
weak will; and after a slow and almost
intolerable suspense the action unwillingly
breaks from words into deeds, from hints
and whispers and guesses into death. The
beauty of the language but serves to heighten
the final dramatic horror. The Honeysuckle,
however, demands an audience sensitive to
poetry and delicate nuances of feeling—not
quite the sort of audience that is so assidu-
ously catered for by the firm of J.C.W., Ltd.
John Masefield’s “dramatic poem,” Good
Friday, in The Fortnightly Review
(December), has for its subject the cruci-
fixion of Christ. Following the discreet ex-
ample of greater dramatists, the author does
not give Christ a speaking part. Indeed He
appears on the stage only in the midst of a
guard of soldiers; He is not shown, only sug-
gested by the onlookers’ comments. The
scene is the paved court outside the Roman
Citadel in Jerusalem. Pilate has already
judged Jesus. He is to be spared and put
outside the gate, and politely warned not to
make any further trouble.' Pilate likes the
man. But he is oppressed: "This earthquake
weather presses on the brain.” His wife,
Procula, pleads for the prisoner. Pilate
admits that Jesus says wise things:—
Too vise by half, and too much wisdom
brings
Trouble, 1 find. It disagrees with men.
We must protect Him from His wisdom then.
He gives audience to the Chief Citizen,
sent by the Sanhedrim, who, since Jesus had
proclaimed Himself king, are afraid of
trouble. And Pilate regards the news as
grave. While not disposed to become a tool
of the priests, he says: “There is no king
save Rome here, while I hold the reins.”
The mob clamor for llis crucifixion. “A
cross on Old Skull Hill is what He needs.”
So Pilate, the Roman Procurator, thinking
only of his duty to Rome, sentences Jesus
to death. Only one person recognises the
divinity of the prisoner, a madman, made
blind by the priests for blasphemy. And
while Christ is being crucified Pilate explains
his decision to his troubled wife.
But Roman laws forbid
That I should weigh, like God, the worth of
souls.
I act for Rome, and Rome is better rid
Of these rare spirits whom no law controls..
Borne fete will be the calmer for His loss.
Hang, perhaps; He made a dangerous claim.
Even had I spared Him it icould have been
the same
A year, or two, from now. Forget, Him,
friend.
Joseph comes to claim the body. Pilate is
amazed to learn that Jesus is already dead.
“I thought He woyld endure longer than
that; He had a constant mind.”
Longinus, a centurion, comes with his re-
port of the death. He reports a terrible
earthquake on the hill, and renders a revised
version of the crucifixion.
Then it grew dark,
Till the noon sun teas dwindled to a spark,
And one by one the mocking mouths fell still.
IFe were alone on the accursed hill
And we were still, not even the dice clicked;
Only the heavy blood-gouts dropped and
ticked
On to the stone; the hill is all bald stone.
And now and then the hangers gave a
groan....
God. Lord, it is a slow way to make die
A man, a strong man, who can beget men....
Then wily Herod comes to thank Pilate
for his courtesy in crucifying Jesus, and pro-
mises the Roman governor his friendship.
An interesting play, but solely interesting
for its subject. Masefield’s rimed verse is
not remarkable, and there is little poetry in
his conception. His Tragedy of Pompey the
Great was a drama: this is but an undram-
atic set of verses. As playwright Masefield
stands on The Tragedy of Nan and The
Gampden Wonder.
J*
Leonid Andreyev is already known to this
page as the author of the most remarkable
dramas of modern times. In The Life of
.1 fan, The Black Masks, and King Hunger
this Russian dramatist has produced three
amazing plays, the product of an uncanny
imagination depicted with a sure dramatic
genius. The latest of his plays to appear in
translation is Savva, written in 1906. This
was the second of his 15 plays. His fecundity
is as astounding as his originality. He writes
one or two plays every year. Savva is pub-
lished with The Life of Man in one volume
of Kennerley’s “Modern Drama Series,”
edited by Edwin Bjorkman ($l, New York).
Savva is an anarchist. He earns his liv-
ing by making counterfeit banknotes, and
spends much of his time in playing games
with children. Humanity to him is fit only
for destruction. “The justification for cattle
i 3 that they are without speech. But when
cattle become articulate, begin to speak,
defend themselves and express ideas, then
the situation becomes intolerable, unmiti-
gatedly repulsive.” But though an anar-
chist. Savva includes the anarchists in his
contempt. He tells his sister, horrified to
find that her brother is an anarchist, that
they are very quiet, orderly people, and
very deliberate. “They meet and meet, and
weigh and consider a long time, and then —
bang!—a sparrow drops dead. The next
minute there is another sparrow in its place,
hopping about on the very same branch....
Now yon can’t clear a dense forest by cutting
down one tree at a time, can you? That’s
what they do. While they chop at one end,
it grows up at the other. I proposed a
scheme to them, something on a larger scale.
They got frightened.... So I left them....
One thing I learned from them : respect for
dynamite. .. .Nothing like dynamite for a
convincing argument.”
“Aren’t you afraid?” his terrified sister
asks.
Sawa replies scornfully: “What worse
can happen to a man than to have been
born? It’s like asking a man who is drown-
ing whether he is not afraid of getting wet.”
On the earth he has found nothing more
terrible than man and human life. And he
is not afraid of man. There is only one
thing worse than inescapable human suffer-
ing—inescapable human stupidity. So he
has determined to annihilate everything.
Except man. “Man must be stripped bare
and left naked on a naked earth. The earth
must be denuded ; it must be stripped of its
hideous old rags.” He will leave nothing
behind him for man to look back on: this
will force man to look forward.
Savva means to begin by the destruction
of an ikon of the Saviour in the neighboring
monastery. This ikon has miraculous pro-
perties: every year the ill and the miserable
and the maimed peasants come in a proces-
sion to be cured by the ikon. So Savva
arranges with a monk to place a bomb
before the ikon at midnight of the day
before the annual gathering of the peasants.
He means to destroy that miracle, to “dyna-
mite God.”
There are other characters in this strange
play at least as remarkable. There is one
man who refuses to believe that he —or any-
body or anything else—exists. There is
Savva’s drunken brother who asserts that
people do not exist: all that he can see is
faces, funny faces. Though he never laughs
he goes about terrified that some day he will
see a face so funny that he will begin to
laugh and keep laughing till his laughter
kills him! And in the end he sees that
funny face. The man who does not believe
in anybody’s existence is obsessed with the
wonderful serenity on the faces of the dead.
His explanation is that the dead know- —-
though he doesn’t know what they know.
Savva grimly laughs at him. He tells him
that he is bound to die, and his face will
assume an expression of perfect peace. “A
peaked nose, and all around, stretching in
every direction, a vast expanse of peace.
Can’t you get any comfort out of that?
Think of it, a tiny island of nose lapped in
an ocean of peace.... Tony, why are you
staring at me?” And Tony sadly makes his
invariable answer: “You have a very funny
face.”
His sister, who as a young girl was
always waiting for a miracle from God. but
now believes that He is -waiting for a miracle
from the people—“He is waiting for the
people to stop fighting, hating and destroy-
ing each other”—discovers Savva’s plot,
makes the monk confess and gets him to
promise not to place the bomb before the
ikon. So the brother and sister wait for
midnight, Savva listening for the, explosion,
his sister knowing that there will be no ex-
plosion. But it happens.
Next morning there are marvellous
rumors of a miracle. The heavy iron-work
protecting the ikon has been shattered by
the explosion, but the ikon is untouched.
The glass covering the image is not even
cracked. The faith of the multitude of
peasants is raised to the pitch of delirium,
and in the mob before the ikon three women
are crushed to death. Savva cannot under-
stand it. But he soon learns, from the
monk. He had confessed the plot to his
Father Superior, and was ordered to place
the bomb in position before the ikon. But
first, the monks were ordered to carry away
the ikon into a safe place. The explosion
occurred, arfd the undamaged ikon was then
neatly put back into its place. Hence the
miracle!
The peasants, recognising Savva, rush
upon him and stamp him to death. And
his brother, looking on the disfigured face,
bursts into uncontrollable laughter. “What
a funny face he has!” he cries. And the
crowd ends the play by their ecstatic shouts
of “Christ has risen!”
No wonder that the production of the
play is prohibited in Russia! But in Ger-
many and Austria it has 1 been a great suc-
cess. It seems just the sort of play that
would please the Hun.
“Verdad”: There Is a kind of tale that is called
in South America a “German tale ” It presumably
illustrates Hun humor. It frequently ha 3 no point
at all, and often it is a pure absurdity. It
is always told in broken German-Spanish. The
following example will explain what a “German tale”
is, but this one is perhaps cleverer than the average.
Scene: The German Club at Valparaiso. Enter tele-
graph boy with telegram for Don Otto. Don Otto
takes telegram and reads: “Your brother broken leg
Santiago. Come at once.” Don Otto looks at watch,
sees that if he hurries he can just catch the midday
express to Santiago, about 90 miles inland. Rushes
home, packs bag", and boards express as it steams
out. Arrived at Llav-Llay, the half-way stopping-
place, he gets out, has lunch (details of lunch given,
of course—in fact, tale consists largely of “pad-
ding”) and buys a cigar, returns to « his
carriage, lights cigar, and when train is in motion
again says to himself: “Now, let me read that tele-
gram again. Perhaps there is some mistake.” Reads
again: "Your brother broken leg Santiago. Come at
once.” Suddenly exclaims: “Ah of course. Vat a
stupid fellow I am! I haven’t got a bruder.”
Gallipoli Billjim, the Blood-
bespattered Bronco-buster
from the South
One of the most painful results of the
war to Australia will be the creation of a
new hero of sensational fiction —Gallipoli
Billjim. The Red Indian and the cow-boy
arc- already in their graves. Gallipoli Bill-
jim. the wild man from the Australian bush,
will dominate the boy’s and flapper s fiction
of the future. It is for this that Billjim
died at Gallipoli. Already Capt. R. W.
Campbell has collared Billjim, in The Kan-
garoo Marines (Cassell, Is.) ; and Australia
will learn that our boys have been butchered
to make a writer’s royalties.
The author apologises: “I am not an Aus-
tralasian, I am a Scot. Therefore I hold
no special brief for the folks down under.
But I am an Imperialist—one filled with
admiration for our overseas Dominions and
the self-sacrifice of our colonial cousins.
They have astonished the world. They have
even exceeded our own expectations. Bet
us write deep in the annals of our literature
and military history this supreme devotion,
this noblei heroism.” Thanks, most humbly
thanks ; but we have not asked Capt. R. W.
Campbell, author of Private Spud Tamson,
to write it, nor are we flattered at the cari-
catures of the four alleged Australians whom
he has selected as typical. However, he
actually claims to know something about us.
“I have lived in Australia and Maoriland.
I have served on a Sydney paper and with
the M.L. Herald. I have met every Pre-
mier (Federal and otherwise).” His little
book, lie says, is an inspiration of the Dar-
danelles, where he met “many of our Aus-
tralian friends. It is not an official history.
I have, in my own way, endeavored to pic-
ture what like these warring Bohemians
are.” His own way is, incidentally, a rotten
way, and his endeavors to picture persons
who are certainly not Bohemians are as
feeble as his writing.
He takes four “typical” Australians as
heroes; and only one of these is an Aus-
tralian. The others are a monocled pommy,
the son of an English lord, a wild Irishman
and a fearsome Scot, each speaking the
unadulterated dialect of his respective tribe.
The remittance-man always wore a white
collar and used kid gloves when dung-lifting
or. sheep-shearing at the station! The author
believes that the Australian army
was recruited by private individuals, for the
book opens with an alleged ad. in a Sydney
paper, “renowned for its wit and origin-
ality,” in these typically Australian words :
Wanted—looo cheerful toughs to enlist for the
period of the war in the Kangaroo Marines. Boosers,
scrirnshankers and loonies barred. Gents with big
waists and little hearts are barred. Sharpshooters
on the wallaby, able to live on condensed air and
boiled snakes, are cordially invited. Jackeroos.
cattlemen, rouseabouts, shearers —every sort of
handy-men welcome... .This is to be the crack corps
of the Australian Force.
And the next person we meet is a Labor
M.P., who horribly mangles his aitehes and
generally behaves as no Labor member has
ever behaved outside the author’s feeble
imagination. Sam Killem, who had appar-
ently appointed himself to the command of
the Kangaroo Marines, sits in his recruiting
office, “chewing a cigar in the usual Austra-
lian style.” Thanhs to IL W. Campbell,
every Australian hero in the fiction of the
future will chew liis cigar in the usual Aus-
tralian style. For Campbell has been here:
he knows. One of the recruits “was found
as a kid on the Woolamaloo Road.” And
the men were “the oddest bunch of daring,
devilry, romance and villainy that had ever
gathered for war.” Our fine, straight,
young, clean-living, carefully-selected sol-
diers ! And Bill inevitably remarks, “Gee
whiz! this is some town!” You see, the
new hero of sensational fiction brings along
with him the language of the old. And a
nice Australian girl remarks contemptuously
about the “Pitt-street toughs” and the
“Manly larrikins.” Probably she was think-
ing of the editor of the Herald and Dr.
Arthur.
When we have the genuine Australian in
E. C. Buley’s Glorious Deeds of Austral-
asians. there is no need for Capt. R. V.
Campbell to butt in with his mistakes and
his mistaken praise. For praise implies
patronage; and it may be news to Capt. R.
W. Campbell that Gallipoli Billjim does not
like the one and does not need the other.
And Billjim ought to bring a libel action
against R. W. Campbell.
Bartlett A. meets a celebrated poet: In
March, or thereabouts, 1914, I met some
Englishmen in Tahiti. The first was stay-
ing at the same hotel as myself, and one
evening we yarned for awhile ; or rather I
did —he conversed. He had elephantiasis of
the Ego rather badly, so I yarned with him
no more. The second, a handsome chap,
fair, medium length, spent most of the time
at Mataiea, round the coast, but whenever
he came into Papeete he frequented the Ego,
so I kept clear of him. No. 3’s first appear-
ance was at dinner, with the other two, the
last evening I was there. After dinner I
went abroad the Moana bound for Welling-
ton, M.L. A little later the trio came up
the gangway: No. 3 duly arrayed for de-
parture—shell necklaces, halo of tiare and
frangipanni, etc. —while No. 2 carried his
bag for him. All the stewards had melted
into thin air, so No. 2 persisted as porter
and landed the bag in its berth. Then I
found that No. 3 was to be my cabin-mate.
He was a. decent sort, so I overlooked the
Ego, and in due course with acquaintances
from shore we held a korero on deck. I
don t_ know whether the barman was paid
overtime. At midnight the others went
ashore and No, 3 and myself sailed away.
A nymph, who babbled Tahitian French
very nicely, was the cause of my not remem-
bering much of the general conversation,
but I recall that No. 2. the self-appointed
porter, seemed a fine fellow, so next dav I
asked my cabin-mate who he was. The re-
ply was, “Oh, he’s Rupert Brooke. Rather a
clever chap; writes for the Westminster
Gazette, you know.” And that’s how I met
a famous poet and didn’t collect a pocketful
about him. By the wav. No. 3,
who had been at Mataiea, told me that
Brooke, while there, was working on a play;
scene laid in Canada. Who knows anvthing
about it? -
In The Danger of Peace (Bell, Is. 6d.)
J. W. Allen brilliantly enforces this obvi-
ous conclusion: “Our duty is to continue
the war until Germany is, in a military
sense, completely powerless. It is a terrible
task.... We are in a position in which we
cannot logically make peace until Germany
has no choice but to accept our terms
The one supremely important thing about
the terms of the future treaty is simply this:
that they shall represent agreement between
us and our allies, and not agreement between
us and Germany The result of a drawn
battle would mean that we, like cowards,
had passed on the punishment of our great
refusal to our children and to our grand-
children.” It is a terrible task, and the
fulfilment of it is a terribly long way off.
At last a critic has found a needed good
word for hack-work. In a recent Bookman
(New York) a writer says: “Hack-work
never yet has hurt a writer worthy of the
name; so long as he realises it is hack-work,
and does it sooner than submit to outside
employment distasteful to his temperament.”
And he offers, as proof, Arnold Bennett,
whom, by the way. he shrewdly suspects was
christened, not Enoch Arnold, but Enoch
Arden, since Tennyson’s sentimentalities
were the rage among the people of the Five
Towns at the time of Bennett’s hirth. Ap-
parently the numerous sensational serials
with which Bennett kept the pot boiling did
not impair his Five Towns novels. It is
better to keep alive on hack-work than to
perish before _ you deliver your message
that is, provided you have a message to
deliver.
THE PLOW.
111 K PROW.
From Egypt behind my oxen, with their stately stpn
and slow, *
Northward and east and west I went to the desert
sand and the snow ;
Down through the centuries, one by one, turning the
clod to the shower,
Till there’s never a land beneath the sun but w
blossomed behind the sower.
I slide through. the sodden rice-fields with mv grunt
ing, humpbacked 'steers,
1 turned the turf of the Tiber plain in Rome’s
imperial years ;
I was left in the half-drawn furrow when Cincinnati
came,
Giving his farm for the Forum’s stir to save his
nation’s name.
Over the seas to the north I went; white cliffs and '
a seaboard blue ;
And my path was glad in the English grass as mv ■
stout red Devons drew- ‘
My path was glad in the English grass, for behind
me rippled and curled
The corn that was life to the sailormen that sailed
the ships of the world.
And later I went to the North again, and day bv ,
day drew down
A little more of the purple hills to join my kingdom
brown ;
And the whaups wheeled out to the moorland, but
the gay gulls stayed with me
Where the Clydesdales drummed a marching song
with their feathered feet on the lea.
Then the new lands called me westward ; I found on
the prairies wide
A toil to my stoutest daring and a fbe to test my
pride;
But I stooped my strength to the stiff black loam,
and 1 found my labor sweet
As I loosened the soil that was trampled firm by a
million buffaloes’ feet.
Then farther away to the northward; outward and
outward still
(But idle I cross the Rockies, for there no plow mav
till! j,
Till I won to the plains unending, and there on the
edge of the snow
I ribbed them the fenceless wheatfields, and taught
them to reap and sow.
The sun of the Southland called me; I turned her
the rich brown lines
Where the Parramatta peach-trees grow and her green
Mildura vines ;
I drove her cattle before me, her dust, and her dying
sheep,
I painted her rich plains golden, and taught her to
sow and reap.
From Egypt behind my oxen, with statelv step and
slow,
I have carried your weightiest burdens, ve toilers
that reap and sow.
I am the ruler, the king, and I hold the world in

Sword upon sword may ring, but the triumph shall

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a 'curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
dke tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
=dges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache. rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
d
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color —a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Tills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly' quick relief—every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

the iVose and Throat are
treated effectively with
Medicated Oxygen inhaled

*' Kat-aT'ah** Treatment
has a direct influence upon
the catarrhal poisons of
the body and conquers the
disease by removing the
cause.
Are You a Victim of
CATARRH!
You know what Catarrh is, with its humiliating and discomfort-
ing symptoms.
A slight cold develops into a stubborn and protracted one, while
the discharges from the nose are most offensive and annoying.
As the inflammation extends further up into the head and the
delicate mechanism of the ear is attacked, there is a continual
buzzing and ringing in the ears, and frequently the hearing is
partially or totally lost. Headaches are almost constant, with
sometimes acute pains in the eyes, and the nose becomes so
plugged up that the patient must breathe through the mouth,
while the slimy secretions g,re forced back into the throat,
requiring almost continual hawking and spitting to dislodge them.
At certain stages of the disease the odor of the breath becomes
very bad, to the mortification and embarrassment of the sufferers,
and the disgust of all who come near them. Gradually the
mucous discharge finds its way into the internal organs, and a
most miserable form of Dyspepsia, or Catarrh of the Stomach, is
the inevitable consequence. The blood becomes contaminated by
catarrhal poisons and unhealthy matter, and these are
distributed through the body.
Catarrh is then a deep-seated, dangerous, constitutional or
systemic disease, and its effect upon the general health and
system is soon apparent —appetite and strength are gone, weight
is lost, despondency takes the place of confidence, and the disease
frequently settles in some vital organ or terminates in Bronchitis,
Asthma, Neuritis, or dread Consumption.
Trial Bottle of
“Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant
ELuJLbrJI
ljlJ
I want all who are afflicted with Catarrh to try a sample bottle of “Kat-
ar-ah ” Inhalant at my expense. It is a synthetic compound of certain
valuable medicaments, and is supremely beneficial in *ts influence on the
mucous membrane. It has a distinctly soothing, healing and sero-eanative
effect, sufficient todisintegrate and dislodge the slimy mucous accumulations.
,l Kat-ar-ah” is first aid to Catarrh sufferers. Its healing effects are
simply marvellous. You can notice an improvement immediately after
beginning its use. It quickly takes up its work of killing the disease
germs, of minimising and eventually stopping the discomforting mucous
discharges in .he nose and throat —mucous that is finding its way into
your stomach and poisoning your system.
I will supply you with a Trial Bottle of “ Kat-ar-ah ” Inhalant FREE OF
CHARGE, if you will send me your full name and address, together with
3d. in stamos to cover cost of postage. Write address plainly, state
whether Mr., Mrs., or Miss, and be sure to mention this paper. Send
for your bottle NOW.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mater Triumphans.
Two were the sons I bore.
Stalwart and tall they grew,
Fearless and true.
All the brave old-time lore
I sang for their lullaby,
Of heroes who sailed and fought
And feared not to die.
Clear saw they right and wrong,
The straight gaze of Truth they met,
JLheir own eyes an answering fire.
Glimpsed they the glory rare
Of sword-steel flashing bare,
Catching the sunlight there,
Here dimmed for Empire.
So when the bugles blew
And Right’s brave banner flew,
Without thought or pause
To battle my two sons went.
Gladly the twain I sent;
I pray God each moment
They’re worthy the Cause.
Blinded? They cannot be!
They have the inner light
That turns gloom to glory.
Crippled? No wound can reach
The true soul and fearless.
Death? ’Tis but the door to life!
My proud eyes are tearless.

Last Night.
Which way did you come? Not fey the stair,
But through some ladder of light and air.
Perhaps you swung to the moonflower’s disc
By a clinging tendril, and took the risk
Of a moonray’s dirk on the balcony
To leave the darkness and climb to me?
Which way did you come? As a trembling
ghost,
Your footfall lost in the high wind’s boast
As he clapped the boughs of the weeping
figs
To an eerie chorus of clashing twigs, *
As he bent the grass in the gardens low
To smooth the way for a ghost to go?
How did you signal? In my soul?
Or break through my heart’s demure con-
trol ?
Did you prise the locks of the world apart
To carve a road to a guarded heart?
Did the drawbridge rise when the time was
ripe
To the quick command of a fairy pipe?
Did you come, a prince in your jewelled
state —•
Did you come as a palmer, desolate?
Which way did you come? Who can ever
guess ?
But your hand on my hand still seems to
press
And I turn my pillow, to find again
The little hollow where love has lain.
Through slatted windows a cool sun streams
And the dreams of the night are....only
dreams.
Like butterfly blown o’er a desert place
Its wings still wet from a flower’s face,
O star that sought for its heaven here,
A hope too wild, for a gift too dear.
Yet, though doors were closed to a mortal’s
key,
I know last night that you came to me.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
A Mining Lullaby.
The great wheel spins at the poppet-head,
The cage sinks down in the deep, dark mine,
A»d you are home in yopr little white bed
While father works in the candle-shine,
Deep, deep down in the candle-shine.
All night long with hammer and drill
Father will delve in the heart of the rock,
But you will be sleeping, quiet and still,
When father waits for the rending shock,
The booming blast and the shattering shock.
The great white stars will hang in the sky,
The cold night wind will sob in the tree ;
But while in sleep’s soft arms you lie
There’s never a star that father will see,
No twinkling star will father see.
The sky will blush and the hills be red
And the whistle will blow at the end of
night;
Then up you will spring from your little
white bed,
For father comes home. with the morning
light,
Home to you with the morning light.

Unwed.
My boots are on the mantel-piece;.
Some cray-claws hanging on the bed
Inform me that in splendid style
Before I went to sleep I fed.
He knows not, who is single still,
The joy it is to be unwed !
The washing-up is all unwashed,
And, if I need a cup to drink.
I needs must go and search awhile
Amongst the litter by the sink,
Where piles of heaped-up china rest
Upon a catastrophic brink.
Perhaps the house is not too neat,
And needs a tidy woman’s touch;
For sitting-rooms may not be meant
For pants and collars, hats and such;
And matches spilled and fag-ends show
About the carpet overmuch.
Still, this at least is liberty ;
And not a single word is said
When I, at easn amid the mess.
Decide to smoke a pipe in bed.
My wife says it’s Tier holiday;
I know that it is mine instead.

THE MEN WHO DON’T CARE A CUSS.
A\ hen men like llaldane and llobiiouse
and Asquith pitch voluntaryism overboard,
the man who sets out to defend it has a
pretty hard job on hand ; for academic argu-
ments about individual rights mostly sound
like belated snores when the meeting is inter-
rupted by an enemy battering at the gate
and yelling his intention to turn the afore-
said rights into sausage meat. Also it hap-
pens that the number of people who have
rushed forward in Britain to save the great
principle of voluntaryism is vastly less than
was confidently predicted by the badly-in-
formed authorities on the subject. The cold
truth is that experience has converted the
nation since the one question became. Shall
wo win or lose? There are no half-way
places in this fight, and outside those queer
little committees which occasionally issue
communiques to the universe calling upon
everyone to hoist the white flag and let
bygones be forgotten, the argument for con-
tinued voluntaryism comes from people who
can be relied upon to go on assisting to
make voluntaryism a failure. They are solid
in their determination not to volunteer, any-
how. It was put this way the other day at
an anti-conscription meeting in Australia:—
No country on earth is worth the sacrifice of a
single working-man’s life.
This observation crystallises all that the
opponents of national service have to say
against the democratic doctrine they resist.
The meaning of their yelp is, of course, that
war is an evil thing, so monstrous that it
should never be resorted to. The citizen who
refused to serve in the army of his country
when it was used to force war upon a neigh-
bor would probably strike a high note of
altruistic patriotism. But for the very
reason that might make such an act heroic,
the citizen who, on the other side, bowed his
neck to the yoke, and invited the brigand
who attacked him to do his worst, could be
viewed as no better than a dingo. It may
be true that the causes which lead to war
are invariably squalid and not worth the
sacrifice of the meanest life; but there is not
much doubt that to the people who are
threatened by a conqueror’s bayonet the
issues are worth every life with which
resistance has to be purchased.
Consider what it means for men living
under the ample freedom of Australia to
proclaim their belief that defence of this
continent against a foreign conqueror is of
no serious public or private concern. .Among
other things it includes acceptance of this:
That it doesn’t matter to Australia whether
the German comes out on top, or whether
the Turk takes command of the situation.
The only thing that does matter is that no
"working man” shall lose his life. Unfor-
tunately for this theory and the anti-fight-
for-anything crowd, the consequence of a
German victory, would be to impose on Aus-
tralia the theories of government which find
favor with the Prussian monarchy. In that
case the whole fabric of democracy as it is
known to Australians would be torn to
shreds; the Australian who wouldn’t risk
his hide for Australia would have to risk it
for Yon Damstein and Gottstrafe or get
a bullet in the neck. And he would be
deprived of his vote, and of his ox and his
ass and everything that was his. For him
the world would be upended, and if he made
any remarks on the subject he wouldn’t
make them any more. Nor is the argument
limited to the German. It applies equally
to the dreams of conquest and avarice that
may smoulder in the mind of the Emperor
of Abyssinia or the Sultan of Morocco or
any other potentate who could acquire a gun
and a fleet of catamarans to float himself
and his warriors along in this direction and
settle matters with a club. As, according to
the above-mentioned theory, it wouldn’t be
worth anyone’s ivhile to risk his life through
getting in the way, the gentleman with the
club would, have an easy job on. In fact,
nothing quite like it would have occurred
since the time a Spaniard wandered casually
into. Peru without knocking, and everything
fell in a heap at his feet.
* * * *
That the manhood of Australia should be
butchered on European battlefields is a
heart-breaking circumstance. But that the
men and women and children of Poland
and Belgium and Servia should be a
homeless, starving rabble is a terrible
circumstance, too. The only offence
these _ peoples committed was that they
were in the road of an international burglar
-—a sin that can be easily committed by any
other collection of individuals if they only
make themselves look sufficiently docile. No
sane advocate of national service in Aus-
tralia ever suggested that war was some-
thing good, in itself or ever implied that it
was .anything but a foul abomination. Glori-
fication of war is madness. The case for
national service has its foundation on war’s
ruthlessness and horror —on recognition of
the fact that war must be met by war by
people who would live. The rock-bottom
argument for voluntaryism is that, under
that system, governments may be restrained
from plunging into war through fear that
the nation, disapproving the enterprise, will
not volunteer in sufficient numbers. It thus
is something like an inverted referendum.
But such a system, designed to put a brake
on filibustering operations, becomes a jest
when several other nations leap at your
throat. And that is where John Bull
found himself when the avalanche of Hun
broke loose, and where Uncle Sam is be-
ginning to think he may yet discover him-
self, and where Australia was when the
fight for Australia began—happily on the
next selection instead of on its own home-
stead.
FEAR—AND HEAVEN SEND US
MORE OF IT!
It was the downright Napoleon, with a
direct view, of things, who described courage
as the ability to fear and face a danger.
Fear turned to proper account has a big
military value and a moral importance that
fools are apt to leave out of human estimates.
To ignore fear is to discount courage and to
throw over the landscape a dust of unreality
which obscures the view and makes the aim
untrue. The fearless statesman plays golf
or marbles until the trembling enemy, keen
through terror to take advantage of every
possible opportunity, has him in a corner;
and if he keeps on being fearless he has at
the finish to sign the peace treaty at the
wrong end. The fearless nation plays
cricket and backs horses till the guns are
mounted on the next hill, and even then can
hardly be persuaded to get a rifle and shoot,
because it is not in the least scared of the
noise or in terror of death or afraid to see
its women and children at the mercy of the
foe. To be really fearless is a dull, cow--
like sort of business that offers a better-
guarantee of defeat than any cowardice.
We need fear. It is a genuine, wholesome,
natural ingredient in the national make-up.
and as valuable as munitions or battalions
or transport or any of the other things by
which wars are won.
* * *• *
Yet our boast is that we do not fear; that
whatever may happen it will find us slouch-
ing along with the same old cheerful grin
and confident still that somehow and some
time we will pull through. We have made
a fetich of this attitude of mind. It is one
of the distinctively English gods that we
have imported to Australia along with State
Governors and cotton rags, and before which
we bow daily in humble and breathless ado-
ration. So complete is our worship of fear-
lessness that we fall into abject terror of
being afraid. The absolute dread of any-
body tipping up the god sideways and show-
ing that he is stuffed with sawdust accounts
for a lot of the vagaries of the censorship
and the parrot-like repetition of threadbare
Phrases in the press. Daily and hourly the
public reads the statement that the Allies are
bound to win in the end. that however long
the war lasts-it can only end in one way, and
that the heroism of French or Russian or
British troops has been unexampled. All
this is.in the way of offering incense to the
fool deity that is helping us as far as possible
on the road to defeat. We are so afraid
that at last we may start up in sincere fright
that a steady stream of boasting is poured
out to counterbalance any tendency to
trembling. Not that we fear the opinions of
others.- Nationally we are far too com-
pletely self-centred to worry about the im-
pression our conduct might make on the
other fellow. Our real fright is about our
own opinion of ourselves. We fear fear,
and have such cold feet worrying about our
own courage that we have not enough time
left to arrange the details of the smashing
blow which, if we were really afraid of the
enemy, we ought now to be delivering.
It is high time we adopted a more human
and practical attitude of mind. There is not
the slightest doubt that the enemy is afraid
of us ; and we have the very best of reasons
to be afraid of him. Hitherto he has had
the best of the fighting. Every one of the
Allied nations has in turn been forced to run
away from him ; and although he has been
compelled now and again to do a sprint from
them, he has never gone far or ceased to
look dangerous. After many months of the
struggle we are still looking for some sort of
surprise that may turn the tables; yet all
the surprises on land hitherto have been of
enemy manufacture. The man who says he
is not afraid under such circumstances is
bitterly emphasising his utter lack of one
important human and soldierly quality ; and
his confession that he has no fear goes far to
explain why we still suffer defeat at the
hands of our properly-frightened enemy.
* * *• *
Fearlessness is one of those English tradi-
tions that we ought to drop suddenly and
enthusiastically. Good, honest alarm means
action. It is based upon a decent apprecia-
tion of the things which are worth while.
Fearlessness presupposes that nothing really
matters, that the cutting of your father’s
throat, the degradation of your wife and your
sister and the starvation or slavery of your
mother and your children are merely items
in a comedy of chance which in the true
comedy vein you may try to prevent if there
is nothing more interesting doing, but which
in the sum of things don’t amount to more
than a ragtime tune or *a sixpenny cigar.
Honest fear shudders at the thought of a
father’s pain, a mother’s agony or a child’s
helpless misery, and straightway snatches up
a gun with the conviction that nothing else
matters until the danger is past. Between
fearlessness and cowardice there is not much
to choose; but on the whole the advantage
is with sheer cowardice when estimating the
chances of military success. Fear is an
element in cowardice; but fear in the better
sense seldom acquires cold feet. It is high
time that a good, wholesome fit of shudder-
ing shook this continent. Fearing the enemy
properly, we shall do our part in smashing
him ; but while we gaze with a stupid con-
fidence at the ever-increasing danger, “vol-
untaryism” and muddle and “Kitchener
trains” and a thousand other follies must
mark our alleged efforts towards victory.
Let us get rid of the shameful fear of fear
and put ourselves fairly into the grip of the
big scare, and our organisation of the things
that count from a military point of view
will be equal to our valor in the field. Fear
—the fear that nerves the arm and heart —
played its part at Gaba Tepe. If only it
could lay violent hands on our eager patriots
of the pub and street corner there would be
a bigger hope of the war working swiftly to
its right conclusion.
WHY NOT EVACUATE BRITAIN?
“Rimu” shows England the way out: —
The splendid success with which the Australian
and “Home” troops were withdrawn from Gallipoli,
contrasting so vividly with other features of the big
war, makes it clear that the supreme genius of the
British peoples is seen in evacuation. It is true
that the Australian landing at Gaba Tepe surprised
all military experts ; but, apart from this, the great
British feats which have won most applause are the
retreat from Mons and the flits from Anzac, Suvla
and Cape Helles. It is not only good business from
a military point of view to drop an untenable posi-
tion as swiftly as you would a red-hot tiger snake,
but it is also a sound policy in either peace or war
to give up a place that has ceased to be worth
holding, and use all your strength and skill to main-
tain a footing on the spot which seems best worth
while. Following out the same line of argument, if
there are two places one of which is of only moder-
ate value and exceptionally difficult to hold, and
another of priceless worth and easy to keep against
all-comers, it may pay you to drop the first and
plant yourself down firmly on the second. In doing
this you may be leaving something to which you
have a sentimental attachment, but you are follow-
mg the dictates of that large, wholesome horse-sense
which is, after all, the last word in both military
and civil arrangements.
Now, why not organise a scheme for the evacua-
tion of Biitain and a general national retirement
upon Australia ?
Instantly the objection will be urged that
the job of removing the gross bulk of the nation
and its baggage is too tremendous. But is it re-
membering all the time the special genius of the
British people ? As Britain does not feed herself, but
is dependent upon outside supplies, and as a man
eats a great many times his own bulk in food every
-'■ear, it follows that the removal of all the people of
that land, spread over a period of 12 months, would
be a smaller undertaking from the carrying point of
view than that entailed in binging them their break-
fast, lunch and dinner as at present. To carry away
all the machinery that is up-to-date and in good
working order would be a heavier job; but to
simplify matters there might be a distinct under-
standing that very ponderous things like the House
of Lords, the Archbishoprics of York and Canterburv
and the Oxford and Cambridge Universities should
be left behind, their bulk being so greatly in excess
of their utility. Carefully arranged, with the atten-
tion to detail which characterised the Gallipoli with
drawal, the evacuation of Britain is quite within
the bounds of possibility. Practically the whole of
the world’s shipping is available for the under-
taknig, and with a sufficient escort the huge fleets
Vhich carried the retiring nation would be compara-
tively safe on the seas. F
The sentimental objection that Britons would be
leaving the land of their ancestors should not be
allowed to carry much weight. It is perfectly true
that on British soil Anglo-Saxon pirates wrought
some terrible deeds of blood; that in the course of
the centuries the descendants of those pirates were
extensively butchered by Norman brigands; thlt
ancient cast es mostly in ruins, attest the throat
cutting proclivities of the people even in times of
peace; that generations of people who died o
violence, hunger, avoidable disease and liquor are
hTI ‘ e /T tncted area of the islands; and
that the dust of heroes such as Shakspeare Miltov
Cromwell, Nelson and Burns still mixes’with
general soil. It is also true that George Re„, has
just been handed a seat in the House of Commons
and Andrew Fisher is bursting into bloom as w
tralia s High Commissioner. Further, amid all 'the
lapine and plunder and violence of older davs, ancient
oak trees grew and old gardens gave forth a magical
perfume; and the very fact that the plumber nifssed
his job and the stonemason built carelessly gave to
old buildings and villages and cities the mouldering
charm that somehow grips hard at human heart”
lint tearing aside the false glamor of romance and
alleged history, and admitting that the poetry of
old lands is mostly summed-up in the single phrase
“lack of sanitation,’'’ and throwing George Reid and
Andrew Fisher in, it is impossible to maintain that
the population of Britain would have much to lose in
leaving the best it possesses. As for the worst it
might leave, the slums of London, the horror of
blackness in Lancashire, Yorkshire and other manu-
facturing countries, the narrow and polluted villages
of some agricultural districts, the petty oppression
of local potentates, the grim struggle for bare ex-
istence, the congested thought of middle-class re-
spectability—all these are things that might be
relegated to the dustheap without a pang of the
cheapest sentimental regret. The advantage’ of get-
ting into a bigger, cleaner country of wider oppor-
tunity must outweigh the best claims of the ancient
land; and the worst that Australia has to offer is
better than the best nine-tenths of the population of
Britain have ever known.
But what about the objection that such a with-
drawal would be equivalent to a triumph for the
enemy, both morally and actually?
Well, the evacuation of Britain need not mean
the end of the war nor the handing over of the
territory evacuated to the enemy. The fleet could
still operate from British ports, if it was thought
woith while; and its task would be considerably
lightened by the fact that the women and children
had been removed from the back of the naval lines.
But why not offer the empty country to all the
refugees of the world ? Let the Belgians stay there;
let the Servians and Montenegrins have a corner!
The things the British evacuation left behind would
form a basis for reorganisation. Here, in this con-
tinent, Australian law would still have to be
observed; and the undesirable alien elements which
are barred, but which Britain has received with
open arms, would remain on • the old soil. The
retirement of Britons from Britain, far from giving
an opportunity to the enemy, would be one of those
master-strokes of war policy which would make it
quite impossible that the Kaiser could win. To
equal the British strategy it would be necessary
that Germany should also evacuate her narrow
lands and findl a broad place in the sun. Failing to
do this the Teuton must be regarded as morally
defeated, even if left in possession of Belgium or
Servia. The German has no genius for evacuation.
Throughout the whole war the somewhat orderly
retreat from the Marne is the single instance in
which he has shown even moderate talent in
getting away from his foe.
Once landed in Australia, the position of the
British people would be impregnable. The exploita-
tion of this continent would create wealth in such
quantity that the war and transport expenditure
would seem as insignificant as an overdue milkman’s
bill. Breathing fresher air, warmed by a brighter
sun, feeling the breadth of the land and the heights
and depths of possible national achievement, stirred
by the sense of newness and the ordered purpose of
the whole movement, the entire race would be re-
born. In a very little time even the squire and the
parson and the other non-intellectual forces of Brit-
ish dullness and ineptitude would be so changed,
smartened and generally improved that it riiight be
quite safe to admit them to an equal franchise with
native-born Australians. Great cities, designed on
the best modern plans, would spring into existence.
The whole continent would be sprinkled over with
the homes of men, with enough space left between
homesteads to provide for the baby for 50 genera-
tions. Considering the alleged fact that the Northern
Rivers of N. S. Wales could maintain the whole
population of the British Islands, the room for
future expansion would not be a serious problem for
the reformer. At last, when the war blew itself out,
Germany could sit down in her circle of graves gnaw-
ing the fag-end of the sausage of discontent and
realise to the full how the great British genius for
evacuation had re-made the world and how utterly
impossible it was fdr the Teuton mind to compete
with a people whose great strategic retreat had dis-
counted all the advantages of war preparation.

The Painful Process of Sobering-up.
Tt used to be the habit of the Australian
iJnker to solemnly wag his head and warn
tw Federal Government against having too
„ ch to do with paper. “We must have an
P reserve of gold,” was the general rule
“kid down. Within certain limits the
hanker was right; but he seemed to forget
t the national aspect of this matter
when he lately pleaded with Federal Trea-
, , r Higgs to lift the embargo on the export
nf metal from Australia. Higgs’s reply was
'•Vo” combined with an exordium on the
need for hanging on to the gold now in the
country and a mild reproach to the banks
r" Peking to deplete the reserve. This
•' it was the Labor man that
~;e h t. Already too much gold
has left Australia —£10,000,000 of it last
vear It has been sent to London or America
for the establishment of trading credits, the
b’dance between exports and imports having
been heavily against Australia for some
rears past. And the object aimed at in
exporting more gold is to create fur-
ther credits, so that Australia may
o*o on buying abroad more than slie
can pay for with goods. Iu six years
the excess of imports over exports lias been
£BO 000.000. This with a mere matter of
about £60,000,000 for interest had to be
either paid for by loans or by sending the
creditor gold: and as the borrowing didn’t
fill up the hole the metal went away. Im-
ports are still pouring in at a ruinous rate,
but the job of unloading the lOU is not so
easy, and the demand for gold at the other
end has therefore become urgent, for there is
mighty little credit in this war-blasted world
just now. The bankers urge that unless they
car ship the gold off, the community will not
be able to “trade.” As “trade” in this sense
means living at a grossly extravagant rate,
consuming the potted chicken and asparagus
of the foreigner, the answer is the simple
one that this trade is no good to Australia—
except to grease the incline down a place
already steep enough. By a prohibitory
tariff Higgs could shut off the excessive im-
port ; by stopping the export of the stuff to
pay for it he gets there by another road,
temporarily at any rate, and anything that
does for a few minutes is good enough for
the politician these days when the ground is
slipping away from under his feet. That it
is better for Australia to keep her gold out-
put on the premises, in order to hold up the
note issue and help finance the war, instead
of exchanging it with Uncle Sam for pickles
and pianolas, looks like a proposition which
even the most rabid foreign-trader would
scarcely dispute. That is the innards of
Higgs’s reply, and the bankers who want to
remit a few million sovereigns to N’York
have no answer to it worth tuppence.

“Passing the Doctor.”
“First Saloon” describes a savage sea rice
which is still practised on the Australian
coast: —•
Because a lumbering Norwegian tramp sagged
ahead of us in the narrow channel under South Head
and refused to heed the siren that moaned at her fat
stern and threshing screw, our hissing 17-knotter
had to linger behind in Sydney Harbor and watch a
red-funnelled rival get a long start and smoke
merrily down the coast towards Melbourne. The
business men aboard presently started to inquire at
what hour the boat would reach Melbourne; and
they kept it up more or less until bedtime on Sun-
day night—which arrived after we had threaded our
way across a darkening sea through the deserted
islands off Wilson’s Promontory. Next morning,
while it was still chill enough to wear an overcoat,
the inquirers awoke in a still ship and found the
Melbourne bay-front suburbs framed in the cabin
portholes. Round the Gellibrand Light a sort of
floating town had grown up. On one bow was the
P. and 0. liner that had left Sydney at midday on
Saturday; on the other was the red-funnelled flier
that had been alternately a bundle of lights and a
smudge on the horizon. Another inter-State liner, a
big foreign tramp and a few nondescript craft made
up the balance. And all the people on all the ships
—perhaps 2000 of them —were “waiting to pass the
doctor”—a semi-savage rite of which nothing much
is heard on land, but which is supposed to be very
potent at sea.
At the direction of the shipping people all the
passengers had provided themselves with very pre-
cious blue papers on which they had inscribed their
shore addresses, in case illness should overtake them
after they had dragged themselves and their baggage
ashore and disappeared with a flourish of cabhorses’
heels in the murk of the city. But that wasn’t to
happen for a long while yet. The anchored ships and
M illiamstown gradually awoke, and the distant fac-
tory chimneys along the flat Port Melbourne water-
front started to drift smoke across the endless river
flats. Industry had lit its morning pipe. Some-
where or other the tribal witch-doctor was having
his bath or his breakfast, or polishing his spectacles,
or finding a bag to carry the blue papers the passen-
gers had prepared for him ; and meanwhile the hun-
dreds of early-risers who had been warned to be
ready to “pass” by 7 a.m., and whose time was
limited, tramped the drying decks of the pulseless
ships, and made the most of the cool hours of the
morning and the astounding variety of things thrown
overboard from a great height by an unseen but obvi-
ously impatient pantryman. All this waste and litter
hit the placid green sea with loud.smacks, and then
drifted away forgivingly to litter some distant beach.
-Ind the people tramped up and down in their shore
clothes, and draped themselves over the rail, and
snapped watches, while they waited to “pass the
doctor.” By this time the meaningless phrase had
almost acquired the force of a familiar incantation.
After long hours, when the sun* had lit up the
vorld and successive tugs had towed strings of mud-
punts from one horizon to the other, a roomy oil-
aunch with a furniture-van roof was seen alongside
°ne of the other ships—the one that hadn’t the
manners to wait for us. We were too far off to see
ow the “passing” Was accomplished ; but we found
out some hours later, when an amiable gentleman
"Uh his hands in his pockets came aboard and was
leceived with great deference by the gold-braided
commander. Followed a great deal of preliminary
ussing and marshalling, and after the self-conscious
steerage passengers had filed through the smoking-
room, handing their papers to the amiable gentleman
jind being ticked off the list by the purser, we of the
rst saloon also “passed”—in procession, and with a
good deal of foolish tittering from the women to
" oin time meant nothing. The spectacled medico
"ith his infallible hands full of blue paper brilliantly
Pa.'ed his low-comedy part of sea-doorkeeper to the
ate of Victoria, and never once let on that the
expicss train knows no yellow flag or leisurely
quarantine official, and that any one of his numerous
victims could have whirled straight into Melbourne
behind an engine without any farcical delay such as
he was paid to provide. Eventually we up-anchored
and steamed up the twisted, muddy Yarra to the city
just in time for lurch when we might easily have
been there for early breakfast.
If there is any virtue in this gradual sorcery it
should be applied to all travellers by land or sea,
and mole witch-doctors of an earlier-rising variety
should be supplied to practise it. If it is useless it
should be interdicted, and the useless tribal medicine-
men burnt at the stake. The next port health-
officer that delays me will have a bone pointed at
him.
♦
Entering the Ranks of Trade.
Somewhere in the remote ages a group of
workers or loafers arose to whom the title
of “professional men” was given in contra-
distinction to the mere tradesman or artisan.
In England four “professions” w T ere recog-
nised: Arms, Law, Medicine and the Church.
Outside these any worker could style him-
self anything he liked; but the big public
drew a sacred line around the four jobs
and put those who worked (or loafed) at
them on a special pedestal. The reason of
that sacred line was at the time good
enough : the professional man was supposed
to render his services in time of need with-
out expectation of gain. The officer in the
Army or Navy never got much of a screw
ia proportion to the alleged splendor of his
work; the lawyer until quite recently
kept some show of philanthropy as a cover
for his keen hunt after big fees ; the church-
man, starved as a curate, had barely enough
to enable him to ride to hounds as a vicar,
and only got back a little of his own in the
rare chance of becoming a bishop. But it
was the medical man who kept closest to
the old professional idea and really did grand
work at great personal self-sacrifice, careless
whether the patient could pay his bill or
not. For this reason the doctor retained his
hold on public sympathy; and when the
Majah, and the person in the wig, and the
holy individual who addressed his dearly
beloved bretheren on Sunday were all made
the targets of ridicule and lampoon, the doc-
tor was always more or less a popular hero.
From this high stand the B.M.A. in N. S.
Wales and some other places has pushed
him down with a thud. It has no use for
the professional idea, and says plainly that
it is out after 100t —plain, common, union-
istic beer and cheese money. The new atti-
tude of the medical man helps to clear up
some difficult things and make room for
genuine reform. The doctor is. on his own
showing, no longer to be regarded as a pro-
fessional man, but must thenceforth be
looked upon as a tradesman pure and simple ;
and the question arises whether as a trades-
man he is entitled to anything like the
return for his services that he has hitherto
been allowed to exact. Some of the finer
trades, in which the top wage may reach
something like ft? per week, and which make
heavy demands on the fidelity and honor of
those engaged in them, take as long to learn
as the ordinary practice of medicine. Why,
then, should the surgeon, if he elects to take
the status of tradesman, he allowed to charge
£5O for an operation which he can perform
in about 20 minutes? We allowed him to
charge that fee to those who could pay it
on the supposed ground that his services
were at the disposal of the public free of
charge when bitter emergency arose. If the
doctor chooses to become an artisan he must
go the whole hog and accept the awards of
Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. It
is the only logical conclusion to his action ;
and if it comes to that there will be quite
a lot of medical men going on foot to earn
a wage of half a crown where they now
whirl in motors to gather in fees of stately
proportions.
The Right to Do Anything at All.
The old battle for the right of free speech
and thought, which is usually regarded as
having been fought to a complete finish in
England a century and a half ago, must be
renewed with some vigor in Austialia it
we are going to keep up even a pretence of
democratic liberty. The other day • D-
Studd, secretary of the I ootscray ( ' ic. )
branch of the P.L.L., threw down his pen
and made a foaming protest against a rule
of the League introduced at the last conter-
ence by which members are forbidden to
associate themselves with church or temper-
ance societies. The idea of the J-L-L-
-appears to be that it has in itself all the
church or temperance organisation, as wen
as all the knowledge of political economy or
social science or anything else, that a Labor
man can possibly need. The League may
be all that it claims to be or it may_ not.
To moderately disinterested persons it is
mostly a loud noise and an ever-increasing
political platform which it makes little or
no attempt to carry out. \ as a pail
of the extraordinary machine of Australian
Government, it is a contrivance for select-
ing candidates for the State or federal
Parliament and pushing their claims befoie
the electors. The religious functions of the
League are not apparent on the surface; nor
does its temperance propaganda stand out
with any distinctness. Somewhere, buried
under the noise and the network of loose
strings, which are from time to time pulled
to get some person into office, there is a
resolution or plank or something in favor
of the nationalisation of the drink trade,
but as this is seldom mentioned and noth-
ever done about it, the League cannot
be said to have temperance particularly
close to its heart. Yet a man who thinks
that religion might he of some use, or who
fancies something might be done to reduce
the frequency and virulence of the pewtei,
is hurled out of Labor’s chief organisation
In the plainest English this means that the
rank and file of the Labor party are for-
bidden to think or act at oH except tPl ™ h
laid down by the annual P.L.L. Conferenc .
Those who do not belong to the rank and
file of the party can, of course, do anything
they please. They are no more bound by
the party’s platform than they are by the
Ten Commandments. On all evidences tha
platform exists nowadays for the sole pm-
pose of concentrating the thought of Kn, ■
tim and his mates on certain desnat
reforms, while their alleged leaders climb
up to the places where the job bangs and
the cash is ripe. It is time Billjim took
hold of the Labor machine and rolled it with
a crash on those who are merely exploiting
the movement. If he doesn’t there are go-
ing to be a lot of Studds to break away.

The Skirmish Against Syphilis.
Before the Westralian Parliament fled into
retirement it did at least one good thing.
Members applied themselves to seeing what
could be done with the syphilis horror, and
finally produced an Act having some excep-
tionally good features. Its best feature, of
course, is that the people who passed it were
prepared to handle the subject in some more
practical way than by talking about it in
a shocked tone of voice and then letting the
matter drop. The scope of the measure is
abruptly limited in comparison with legis-
lation for dealing w T ith such unpleasantnesses
as smallpox and plague and cholera, but it
still gives a fair measure of control over the
individual who happens to be loaded. It
provides that any person suffering from the
disease shall, unless such person seeks medi-
cal treatment, be guilty of an offence subject
to a penalty of £2O; it sits down hard on
prescribing chemists and the peddlers
of specifics; it keeps track of Saw-
bones’s patient; and it includes some-
thing which looks like a useful instru-
ment for dealing with the women who are
the principal means of infection. This last
clause sets out that if the Commissioner
under the Act is informed or has reason to
believe that any person has syphilis he may
demand a certificate showing this to be
untrue, and if he is not satisfied with the
document or if one fails to materialise, he
may call upon two medical practitioners to
hold an investigation and report. Then if
he believes the person will, unless detained,
be a carrier, he may order detention for two
weeks and as long as may be necessary
afterwards. Apparently treatment at the
hands of a medical man is no protection
against this clause, and there is a penalty
of £2O for obstructing its operation by
resisting examination. Its effect is to put
into the hands of someone or other the
machinery for robbing prostitution of its
most dangerous physical evil. A fight against
syphilis while this active source of abomina-
tion is left alone is as hopeless as would be
a campaign against plague that neglected
the rat that harbors the flea ; so Westralia
may be fairly said to have taken a pretty
firm grip of a curse which everywhere re-
quires jumping on with emphatic feet, and it
shall be counted to Scadoan for righteous-
ness. The pity is that the whole continent
is not doing it.

Pearce, Minister for Defence, who is so
often in a delicate position that he may be
said to live there, had to deal the other day
with criticisms concerning the appointment
of A. Bolle as paymaster in a Vic. military
district. The report quite exonerates the
officer from any suspicion of natural pro-
Germanism. His father is a German of 50
years’ residence in Australia, who has paid
only one short visit to the Fatherland in all
that time. Mrs. Boele, sen, was an Irish-
woman. The army paymaster is Australian
born, married to the daughter of Hnglish
people. He has never been to Germany, does
not correspond with his German relatives,
and does not speak or write German —which
last is perhaps the most important considera-
tion of all. Granted that there is no just
cause why Bolee should not retain his mili-
tary job. the inquiries made in his case are
only another argument in favor of a careful
classification of all the aliens, and sons of
aliens, in Australia. It could be done largely
from the last and previous census papers. It
is simple justice to German-named citizens
of the Bolee class that such a record should
be compiled. Between the Schmidt who
brought a German wife to Australia long
ago. but has paid several visits to Berlin in
the meantime and has reared his Hun brood
in a very German home atmosphere, teach-
ing them the language, feeding them when
he could with German literature in the nre-
sence of portraits of der Kaiser —between
him and the Schmidt who came here as a
bachelor, married a local girl, and let his
offspring grow up as Australian natives, in
ignorance of their dad’s language, there is a
vast differenc.e. And should know which
is which, just as we have been permitted to
know what’s what in Bolle’s case.
“Dry Shave”: Besides requiring all the
assistance the House of Tudor can give him
the Australian manufacturer also needs a
dose of ginger. Unless he happens to be in
the food stuff or patent-medicine business, lie
is the most bedridden circumstance in the
universe when it comes to letting the public
know the virtues of his wares. I’ve put
schemes for advertising before many a local
man. and mostly he has whistled for the dog.
A frequent plea is that he can sell all lie
makes without advertising. It never dawns
on his mind to make all he can sell lake
boots llow many brands of imported lmot-
covers can be counted up whilst a single
local brand is being thought of? Yet we hear
praise of Australian boots from every part ot
Europe Hats, too. and woollens and under-
wear, and all the rest of them ! Manufac-
turers of these goods mostly seem to fear the
wrath of Calico .Timmy; yet if they made
their brands household words the warehouse-
men would call around mighty quickly. As
it is thev leave the vigorous peddling to the
representatives of Bro. Jonathan and the
Pitc Von Busch, and then frantically
gnash their teeth because the public
asks for the goods that have been
systematically shoved down its. throat.
That Australia can make things we
know but tehat it can make Heaven
only knows, and neither Heaven nor the
makers themselves seem inclined to tell us.

Solid grumbling is being done by A.M.C.
men in training at Liverpool camp because
venereal cases are being sent into the field
hospital, owing to the overcrowding of the
Milson’s Island segregation camp. The
\ M C men enlisted for active service, and
some of those now at Liverpool have been
there five months; and to hold them back
attending to venereal victims is worse pun-
ishment than it would be to set them nurs-
ing an ungrateful Hun. Five months in
camp to reach the dizzy height of red-plague
nurse is not going to encourage the right
sort of recruit to rush the job. Surely
among the thousands of rejects there could
be found plenty of men who are equally
well fitted for this job.

For the manyth time in the last few years
Victoria’s State Coal Mine lies idle, at time
of writing, and has been so since January
18. It is difficult to say yet whose fault it
is; but seeing that this is a time when the
country needs every shilling it can produce
it is up to the Peacock Government to find
out the why and the wherefore, and make
things sultry for the party or parties respon-
sible. The ‘bother arose through the agree-
ment under which the employees worked
having expired on the above-named date. The
men then held a stop-work meeting, and have
ever since been deliberating over the new
agreement submitted by manager Broome.
This provides, roughly, for an all-round in-
crease of wages amounting to 10 per cent,
on the old rates, and has so far met with
cordial disapproval. The new agreement
should, of course, have been published three
or six months ago, so that the miners might
have deliberated with fitting gradualness, and
have argued points with the manager while
the mine was still being worked. But it
wasn’t, and the men pulled out; whereupon
Broome desired them to continue under the
old agreement, offering to make all increases
finally agreed upon retrospective. But it
was too late then : they had been bitten in
the head by the same insect that is afflicting
the Broken Hill miners, and held up produc-
tion wfflile they argued. One thing the
worker may accept as dead certain: the
oftener he stops production the less wealth
must there be to divide. He may get more ;
but the country must get less —and that is
why the country has a right to feel annoyed.
Presently it may even feel annoyed enough
to do something.
A standing joke among Sydney architects
has been the boast of successive Lord
Mayors of their intention to make Sydney
“one of the most beautiful cities in the
world.” Allen Taylor spent huge sums
resuming slum areas and remodelling dis-
reputable parts of the city, and all the time,
for want of a Greater Sydney, slums were
being formed elsewhere and disgraceful col-
lections of insanitary hovels grew up in
the suburbs. Narrow streets were widened
at tremendous cost, and simultaneously other
narrow streets were formed to give somebody
a widening job later on. Every land-owner
with a block to cut up in the suburbs has
been making the streets practically any
width that suited him, zigzagging them all
over the estate to get the “best results” froni
a crooked piece of land. Sometimes new
roads connect by chance with existing
thoroughfares. Sometimes they come to a
dead end against somebody’s back fence.
When the builder starts to work he generally
pleases himself about the road level because,
in most cases nobody in authority thinks
about it. Consequently, later on. when
the Council builds up roads across low-lying
areas the householder finds his floor a couple
of feet below the footpath, and an embank-
ment is required to keep him dry. In ter-
races a single-brick wall —built with old
material—is the usual partition between two
tenements, so the inmates have to think in
silence to escape being overheard next door.
These are also excellent places for the pro-
pagation and spread of epidemic diseases.
Weatherboard houses are mostly built of
thin pine, guaranteed to rot in about half
the time it takes the unwary purchaser to
make them his own on the easy-payment
system. There is more corruption, deceit and
fraud in house-building and dealing than in
almost any other business going on by day-
light in Australia, and it is about time some-
body whistled up the police; and it is more
than time the whole business of local-govern-
ing Sydney and suburbs was put under one
authority.

“Carfax” wants to see some spade work :
Is Hughes going to turn out a doer? That is
one of the things Australia has to find out. He
has been talking well. What he has said usually rang
with a good patriotism. He has vision and imagina-
tion. But Hughes also has the defects of his
character and his history. There is a practical side
to patriotism. At any rate, there ought to be. But
Hughes on science and industry has merely been
the paraphrase of the magazine article and sugges-
tive of a capacity for dealing with things at long
range. The wheat scheme seems better. The metals
project is more than doubtful, despite loud hurrahs.
Australian industry doesn’t look any more healthy
than it did before, and it is not going to be made
more robust by mere words. On the subject of
national finance, on borrowing, on clambering out
of the pest-hole of debt, on production and on the
restriction of imports produced by other people,
Hughes, for all practical purposes, has been as
dumb as an oyster. He says his main job is to
root out the German. It isn’t. It is to push in the
Australian. His visit to London may impress this
upon him; may convince him that the shaft has
to be sunk right down to rock-bottom. If it
does —good. For hitherto Hughes has not been
right down there very often. Lighting the heavens,
is all very well, but it is the dark holes that want
illumination in Australia.
“Quidam” : One good feature about the
mining industry is that it recognises the fact;
that a steam boiler is a dangerous item when
in bad order, and likely to do great harm
to other people besides the owner. Conse-
quently the Law prescribes the testing of
these potential explosives. The cocky, be it
noted, can use any sort of kettle he likes,
and put anyone to drive it, a cocky and his
friends being apparently of little account;
a miner, on the other hand, must take proper
precautions, and employ a certificated driver.
But in the application of this good principle
there is a variation in practice between dif-
ferent States, and N. S. Wales—almost as
usual —follows the worst. In Vic. and
Queensland boilers are tested by inspectors,
who are, by virtue of their billet, inclined to
give a fair and square trial. But in N. S.
Wales a weird system prevails. Licenses
are issued to private persons—fitters, engi-
neers and—so on—to test boilers, and the
only emolument attached is the fee allowed
for a. test. Consequently boiler-testers work
for foundries, machinery firms, etc., and a

long-headed person with boilers to sell finds
it advantageous to keep a licensed tester on
the premises. Of course, as a mine can
employ any tester it likes, it is unusual to
hunt up the man who has a reputation for
undue harshness. In fact, the tendency often
is to make tender inquiries for the man who
has leanings the other way; and one who
studies bottles more sedulously than boilers
frequently has charms of his own. It is also
noticeable that if a somewhat dubious boiler
is procured from some machinery emporium,
and the tester who works at that establish-
ment is employed, the defects have to be very
marked before it is turned down. Apropos
or which, it may be remarked that, as every
engineer and tester knows, many a boiler
that will stand the hydraulic-pressure test
is really unfit to pass proper inspection. It
is doubtful if it would be possible to devise
a system better calculated to nullify a good
principle than this method of boiler testing
in N. S. Wales. As with many other laws,
it looks like a vigorous attempt to gain a
good deal of credit without raising any in-
convenient trouble by materially lessening
-an abuse.

Uncle Sam Begins to Sit Up
The plain, flat meaning of Woodrow Wil-
son’s sensational speech of last week is:
“We must get ready to fight.” But the
reasons for this sudden change of ground are
not so clear. What is he thinking about?
Who has he got in mind? Whence the peril
that made him say this? —
The circumstances of the world are not what they
were yesterday. I cannot tell you what the inter-
national relations of the United States will be to-
morrow, nor dare I keep silent and let the country
suppose that to-morrow is certain to be as bright as
to-day. America will not be the aggressor, but
America does not control the circumstances of the
world.
Correspondents of London newspapers at
Washington are stated to believe that the
Presidential outbreak was designed to bo a
last warning to Germany that satisfaction
must be given for the sinking of the Lusi-
tania. It may be so. It may not. If it was such
a warning it has an odd sound. The Lusitania
incident is fairly old. The attitude of the
President at the time was well expressed in
the simple observation that “a nation can be
too proud to fight,” and in subsequent insist-
ence upon the legal and moral right of the
United States to trade with neutral countries
without restraint. The controversy between
Washington and Berlin was closed, tem-
porarily, long ago. On the other hand,
the disagreement between Washington and
the Allies concerning neutral rights las
lately grown more acute. There were
lives to be accounted for later in
respect to the Lusitania, lives that had been
lost beyond recall; there are dollars, heaps of
them, at stake now with the tightening of
the blockade —a tightening that was resolved
upon by the Allies in spite of American pro-
test that it would be regarded as an act of
high-banded tyranny. A few days can make
no difference to the United States so far as
the Lusitania is' concerned. But a whole
heap of difference will be made to the United
States’ cashbox if the string around the
throat of neutral trade is given a tighter
(wist. It seems almost incredible that the
U.S.A. should threaten or even hint at the
possibility of war with Britain; but the
President has been unfortunate in timing
his remarks if they were not intended to
suggest anything of the sort. Still there
won’t be war that way. At the most there
can be complications and compromises. But
it will be most deplorable if, by attempting
to coerce England, the United States
should show that their soul is so immersed
in trade that they are prepared to sacrifice
everything to that monster. The President
has the chance to show that the Chicago
abattoirs are not truly representative of the
United States. It would be a calamity, not
so much to the world as to the United States
themselves, if the scholarly Wilson should
have to declare that he himself is
really a freak and that the dollar-
loving butcher is the true type. Of
the war itself, the only news is that
the fight rages on from Mesopotamia
to Flanders, and the German Is making him-
self as comfortable as possible in the Bal-
kans. If the Hun is weakening the signs of
it are Lard to detect. The more imnortant
thing is that the Allies are strengthening.
But at best the job ahead of them is stupen-
dous.

Itodney would be even funnier than it is,
though it is easily the most humorous per-
formance in the show. Hale Hamilton, as
the advt. fiend, combines a little of the
velocity of Niblo with a lot. of the commer-
cial drummerism of Lincoln Plumer.
Maclarnie is satisfactory in the grey hair
of the heavy father who hands out dollars
by the half-million, and Myrtle Tannehill
is about as pleasing a sort of ’Murkan girl
as the plot permits her to be. Leslie Victor
takes second prize in the competition for his
clever caricature of a conventional gilded
young noodle; Beatrice Nieholls presents
brightly a confidence woman who talks French
with crude accents; and Mildred V arren
impersonates a genuine French servant who
ought to know that the other lady is an
impostor. The comedy is well staged and
should prosper.

From this paper’s old-established Mel-
bourne critic: —
There was nothing of the great actor about George
Titheradge, but there was all the finish of first-class
artistry about his work. I remember him —or re-
member my impressions of him —in four Shakspeare
characters, and in all of them he lacked force and
distinction. He played Hamlet, lago (for G. R.
Ireland’s benefit) and Benedick when he still was in
the prime of life ; and years later a somewhat weakened
Titheradge played Malvolio in the Margaret Anglin
revival of “Twelfth Night.” As the Village Priest he
scored most heavily in the lighter scenes, not in the
most dramatic episodes. In the purely melodramatic
part of Wilfrid Denver he was equal to all require-
ments, of course. It came easy to an actor of his.
experience and attainments. And in a round of “draw-
ing-room” comedy characters he ranged from good to
excellent or almost excellent. But perhaps his best
display of versatility as a comedian was his Partridge
in a dramatisation of Tom Jones —one of the earliest
Brough and Boucicault productions. “Tith.” had
been educated to such work. He was an English
provincial actor of some note long before he had
reached 30. He played “lead” in all the old cos-
tume comedies. He knew the business from A to Z,
and was a brainy, careful interpreter of his own con-
ceptions. Once, by the way, he played the part of
elocutionist in a great historical show. He was lead-
ing man—only 28 years old at the time —of a corn-

chose him to speak the proclamation at the durbar.
It was the most shining moment of his gentle life.

And of George Musgrove:—
One of the failings of the late George Musgrove as
a manager—and he had several —was his generosity.
He lacked sound commercial meanness in expendi-
ture, because he labored under the delusion that
lavishness in itself could command success. Having
made more than one singularly lucky stroke, he also
believed in risky ventures. He needed a pessimistic
partner to criticise his proposals from a purely
counting-house point of view—to remind him that the
financial possibilities of attractive shows can be real-
ised only by careful planning of their careers, and
by strict attention to business matters apart from
the stage production. Always English in his sym-
pathies, he was a self-willed showman who lost a
heap of money in Australia through his disregard for
local business conditions.
He started management luckily 36 years ago by
bringing to Melbourne, on behalf of uncle Lvster, the
first comic-opera co. that ever played one piece—
“Tambour Major”—for 100 consecutive nights. His
uncle’s death enabled him to reap the profits of the
commission he had so ably executed. When the co.
had followed up its initial success with “Olivette”
and “Madame Favart,” manager Musgrove had the
ball at his feet. Meanwhile Arthur Garner scored a
success with his London Comedy Co. (in which Tith-
eradge was leading man and Fred Marshall the
brilliant character actor), and Williamson and Maggie
Moore were exploiting “Struck Oil.” So J.ChW.,
the shrewd commercial actor, negotiated with the
rival managers and formed the Williamson, Garner
and Musgrove firm, taking over the lease of Mel-
bourne Royal when George Coppin and co. relin-
quished it.
The new firm produced “Patience” at the Royal
as far back as 1882. When it was revived there a
year later Nellie Stewart made her first appearance
in the name-part. The old Princess’s Theatre was
rebuilt for W., G. and M. ; thenceforth the Royal
was dedicated to drama, and comic-opera became the
specialty of the new house. Partner Musgrove was
chiefly concerned with the Princess’s. I„ those davs
Melbourne was the theatrical metropolis of Australia
The whole business of W„ G. and M. radiated there-
from. Musgrove didn’t get on too well with his part
ners, and early in 1890, before their lease of th
Royal expired, he left the Firm. It became William 6
son and Garner until the land boom burst and
Garner exploded with it. For a time afterwards it
was J. C. Williamson only. This by the way.
When Musgrove broke loose he didn’t immediately
figure as a manager on his own account. Th

MacMahons were lessees of Melbourne Opera House in
1890, and it was there that Musgrove stood at the
back of the Nellie Stewart Opera Co., which played
“Paul Jones, 7 ’ “Boccaccio,” “Madame Angot” and
“Chilperic.” Also, he gave another opportunity to
J. L. Toole, whom Williamson and Garner had lost
money with. Finally, after a term of acknowledged
management in Sydney and Melbourne (during which
time he imported the Gaiety Burlesque Co. that in-
cluded Lonnen and Courtneidge), George Musgrove
entered into partnership with Williamson only, and
for seven years from 1893 he was, as a rule, in his
native England whilst J.C.W. ran the show. Mus-
grove was the moving spirit in the venture with the
expensive double bill —Italian opera and ballet. The
small opera co. that brought “Cavalleria Rusticana”
and “Pagliacci” to Australia had a glorious Aus-
tralian chorus to support it, and the Blue Ballet,
with Bartho and D’Argo as solo dancers, and a bevy
of imported girls among the crowd, was the most
gorgeous moving spectacle this country has seen.
Afterwards came “Ma Mie Rosette” and a number
of memorable productions. But he hadn’t his
heart in this second partnership with Williamson,
lie was trying to establish himself in London, and
for a while he prospered exceedingly. With “The
Belle of New York,” which he produced at the
Shaftesbury, he was said to have cleared £60,000
profit. Strange to say, “The Belle” was only a
moderate success when he sent it out to Australia
with another co. in the last year of his partnership
with J.C.W.
For nearly a year after the dissolution Musgrove
remained in England. Then he came again to Aus-
tralia with the hope of outrivalling the i.ew William-
son firm, which already was going pretty strong. He
had a passion for opera born in him whilst he was a
boy-assistant to his uncle Lvster; so he came along,
as lessee of Melbourne Princess’s and Sydney Royal,
to produce grand opera in English. He kept this
going, probably at a loss, for a long time. The
original co. was strengthened with new importations
-Lempriere Pringle, Ella Russell and Berthold —
after some of the original principals had departed.
Between the grand-opera seasons he presented Nellie
Stewart in “The Scarlet Feather” (a costly failure),
and at Christmas, 1901, he staged “Aladdin,” a
most extravagantly-dressed panto., with Nellie
Stewart as principal boy. He loved rich dressing as
devoutly as he believed in grand opera. But he
couldn't keep a panto, alive for a whole year on
tour as J.C.W. did. Although he got the glory of
bringing Melba back to Australia in 1902 the profits
went to the lady, of course. His real financial success
at this time (1902) was the revelation of Nellie Stew-
art's talent as an actress in drama. He produced
“Sweet Nell,” and kept the same company working
for years on a repertoire that had a good many
losers in it. “Old Heidelberg” and “Zaza” were the
most attractive things next to “Sweet Nell.”
Musgrove's star waned steadily after the time of
“The Fortune Teller” (a comic-grand opera) and
the imported Shakspearian co. that opened in “Mid-
summer Night’s Dream.” “The Dream” was a sweet
production, more artistic in nearly all respects than
Oscar Asche’s revival 10 years later, but Musgrove
had cruel luck in Melbourne with his bold venture.
It was crowding the house when the railway strike
came to blight all theatrical business. “As You Like
It followed “The Dream,” and fell comparatively
flat. Robert Courtneidge, who made a pleasure trip
to Australia in order to stage these productions,
offered to prolong his stay for a week or two if Mus-
grove wanted to substitute “Twelfth Night” for the
comedy that was not paying its way. Musgrove
decided not to make the change. “No,” said he,
admiring Hawes Craven's scenery from the back of
the d.c., “I 11 let this show run. It’s a beautiful
production, and I'm proud of it.” There spake the
prodigal soul in George Musgrove, the man with
admirable instincts and a repellentlv bad manner.
His fortune was ebbing fast when he took Nellie

At Sydney picture-theatres this week
there is the paradox of an Aus-
tralian photo.-play co. producing the story
of the Nurse Cavell atrocity and a foreign film
firm presenting an Australian story. “Sting-
aree,” showing at the Colonial, is from the
novel by E. W. Hornung, and the Yankee
production gives it all the flavor of a
broncho-busting romance. “The Martyrdom
of Nurse Cavell,” from the scenario by
Agnes Garvin and a first attempt of the
Australian Famous Feature Co., is in every
way a creditable production. The story is
simply and convincingly told in four acts, with
Vera Pearce in the title-role, supported by
Harrington Reynolds, C. Post Mason, John
Garvin, Charles Villiers, Ethel Bashford
and other well-known players. It will be
screened at the Lyric this w r eek and then
transferred to another of the Picture Block
theatres.

The 1915-16 Tivoli Follies have about one

after this Bulletin emerges. Peter Daw-

balance of the season the Follies will serve
up a fresh mixture every evening.

Marlow’s laudable effort to restore classic
drama to the stage where so many girls
have left home or taken the wrong turning
is not unlikely to get due recognition from
a grateful public by and bye. Thus'far, how-
ever, Melbourne is mostly ignorant of
the, fact that “The Merchant of Ven-
ice” at the Princess’s is something to be
grateful for. When Shakspeare pops up in
an unexpected place the public has' to be
coaxed into going to see him. The new idea
wants time to soak in. Houses were not
bad in the first week, but they are pretty
certain to get much better. So they should.
Tiie Bulletin withdraws none of the kind-
est things it said about the show in last
issue. On the contrary this journal wishes
to emphasise its approval of' Allan Wilkie
as. Shylock, and to raise its expressed
opinion of Bassanio, who has improved on
the first-night performance. Also the portly
appearance of Antonio will bear thoughtful
criticism. There is full Shakspearian
authority for it. Shylock has said of An-
tonio : “How like a fawning publican he
looks!”. and weighty Cosgrove, although there
is nothing of the gentle faw’n about him,
would look very like a licensed victualler
if he came to Court in an apron with his
shirt sleeves rolled up. “Othello” will be
staged on Saturday, with Wilkie, of course,
as the immortal colored person.

.“The Chaperon” finishes at Melbourne

name part will be a striking novelty.

“Mother Goose” is still enjoying eight

At the Tivoli in Melbourne the musical
section of the bill has lost Madame Slap
and the Russian pianist, and gained Villiers
Arnold and Pearl Ladd. The rest from Gil.
and Sul. opera has benefited Arnold’s warble
and his “Will o’ the Wisp” in particular is
scoring heavily. The lady, on the other
hand, has waxed plumper since she sang in
“The Chocolate Soldier” at Her Majesty’s,
without adding roundness to her voice. Last
Saturday she was singing below her pre-
vious form. Vaude and Verne and Athol
Tier are later arrivals than several other
people, of whom the gigantic Scherbelis is
the only one that looks capable of lifting
a piano out of the orchestra with his teeth.
SYDNEY TIVOLI FOLLIES.
Walter Weems, the black-faced comedian of
the Follies.
A party named Perona is responsible for
the latest outburst of mechanical .music at
Melbourne Bijou. The virtuoso connects a
large accordion with an electric-bell arrange-
ment and makes the loudest use of the un-
happy attachment. The Three Starrs, song-
andancers, are minor constellations; and
the only difference between the sketch artists
Kingsley and Graham is that the lady is
affectedly sweet and artless, while the nice
young man seems to have been born that
way. The remainder of the programme is
from moderate to good in quality, the bright-
est item being a dorg named Jap who is
really a credit to his cowboy owner.
One of the most interesting of Adelaide
shows is put up by William Harris, who
was in the landing at Gallipoli. He gives
a descriptive lecture, and. having some good
slides, follows the Australians in their
doings from Mena camp, via Lemnos, to
Shrapnel Gully aud Quinn’s Post. lie
knows the things that do not get into war
correspondents’ books; as, for instance, that
in bayoneting an enemy one generally gets a
heavy fall—for if properly dealt with he
crumples up, and you, having come in on
the run, pitch over him on to your head.
Another young Australian who knows what
the public wants is Edwards, at Adelaide
King’s, who finishes an ordinary cross-talk-
ing turn with distinction by reciting Den-
nis’s “Singing Australians” (lately pub-
lished in The Bulletin), as news received
by letter “straight from Ginger” at the
Front. It goes splendidly. This house has
had an unusual sort of bill —no singing in
it Herbert Brooks has nightly escaped from
his steel box, and once survived aa appar-
ently genuine challenge by some local box-
makers who nailed him up in a wooden One.
Also the Glockers swing water-pails—mostly
with success, but the audience is just as
well pleased when the swing fails and the
performer gets a bath. At the Royal the
Anderson Co., after a week of Divorce Court,
has wisely switched on to Australian rails
with “Thunderbolt.” Wondergraph films a
much-boomed “Black Box” from America.
West’s have had a life of Julius Caesar,
produced by an Italian co. that seems to
know a lot more about his goings-on than
W Shakspeare did.
AT POVERTY POINT.
George Marlow throws his hat into the
ring and announces that shortly he will be
an open competitor against J. C. Williamson
Ltd. in the production of musical comedies,
light operas and revues, being “convinced
that there is room for another producer of
this class of entertainment in Australia.”
Then having earned one cheer he proceeds
to make it three with :
In this connection I might state that I am pre-
pared to give Australian talent every opportunity.
Reputations count very little with me, and instead of
bringing out people with great names who have had
their day 1 would much prefer to cultivate the local
product. If I import mummers I will import them
at their best, and not has-beens. (Loud applause.)
If as well as the has-beens the Marlow firm
turns down the never-wases, it may prevent
the average man-playgoer being bored into
being a permanent absentee before he is 40.
“8.X.”: George Musgrove was a theatrical
manager who believed in the best possible
staging. Nothing tawdry would do him, as
those people have long since realised who
remember his production of the bower scene
in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” when
he brought W. H. Denny, Maud Milton and
the others of that capital company to Aus-
tralia. There was no man in this country
who could stage a play with more magni-
ficence. Yet he seldom overdid his effects,
for he was thoroughly artistic. Notwith-
standing the brusque and even morose man-
ner which he exhibited toward strangers, he
had in his nature curious little touches of
sympathy, and possessed some of the sensi-
tive qualities which distinguish the man of
artistic tastes. The only time I ever saw
him go mad was at one first-night perform-
ance when an audience failed to appre-
ciate a friendly producer’s touch of
realism in the forest scene in “As
You Like It.” The producer was seized
with the whim of garbing one of the ban-
ished Duke’s servitors as a cook in white cap
and apron ; and when this individual, some-
where about the time for the Seven Ages
speech, advanced from the background to
serve out soup, or whatever it is that banished
people dine upon, there was an unrestrained
guffaw from the gallery. This was not sur-
prising, but Musgrove’s thunderous criti-
cisms upon the galleryites who laughed con-
stituted a fine example of managerial fury.
“0.K.” : Good old Melba is doing her bit
in the U.S.A. for our war funds. She and
Percy Grainger jointly have given recitals
at Pittsburg and Boston, and it’s a guinea
to a gooseberry the songstress was the lead-
ing spirit in the affairs. Grainger is an Aus-
tralian, but his young manhood was consider-
ably influenced by a stay in Scandinavia.
Moreover, the man who taught him to blay
the biano in Melbourne, and made an eight-
year-old prodigy of him, was Pabs.t, a Ger-
man. who returned to Germany before his
star pupil was sent away to Europe. I abst
had a “star” juvenile pupil in either sex.
The girl was Olive de Huegard (Iluggard),
who eventually married Edouard Seharff.
the aggressively German pianist, late of the
Melbourne University staff. She and her
boy were in Munich when the war broke out.
and the youngster, who showed some talent
for painting, is now studying at an Austrian
school of art.
(Continued on page 3J/.)
The other week it was announced that
Inter-State Commissioner Lockyer, having
six months’ leave, was going to employ it in
looking into the matter of military canteens.
The sooner he tackles the question of prices
charged on troopships the better. Two ships
left almost simultaneously a while ago: on
one soft drinks were supplied at a penny a
bottle; on the other the men had to pay six-
pence. If it was possible for one to do it
at a penny it should be equally possible for
all others. The same anomalies occur in
connection with stationery. Who gets the
outrageous profits that must be made in
some cases is not clear; but there appears to
be shockingly bad buying somewhere. Or it
may be suspiciously good selling. The whole
business of military purchases clamors for
inquiry.
The fact that Victoria’s training ship, the
John Murray, costs the State about £l4OO a
year is worrying Peacock, and he has an
idea of transforming her into a wheat-carry-
ing wind-jammer and sending her with a
cargo to S’Africa. Seeing that the altera-
tion could be achieved at small cost, and that
she would about pay for herself on her first
voyage and make a good lump of the Minis-
try’s salary on her second, and remembering
that she is a comparatively young and sea-
worthy vessel, the idea is worth a cheer.
Any man who keeps a ship lying idle now is
either a German admiral or a lunatic.
Both Victorian and Tasmanian ex-
perience seems to show that, though Price
Regulation Boards are mostly ineffective,
they might do good service in keeping the
bakers from cutting their own throats. When
the Vic. Board was alive it fixed the price of
flour at £l7 10s. and bread at 9d. per 41b.
loaf. After Peacock killed the Board flour
dropped to £l2 10s., but until quite lately
bread stayed at the same old lid. Comoetition
or a tender conscience or something has
lately moved the metropolitan bread-brigand
to lower his figure to Bd., but the public
considers his conscience still too tough, and
wants a considerable further reduction. But
with the Price of Goods Board dead and
the aggregate baker governed by a horrible
understanding there appears no way of
getting it.
Drummoyne, which struggles at the end
of a dusty Sydney-suburban road, had to
vote twice before it could decide on its State
member. When Alderman Graff, the Lib-
eral hope—another city “agent”—gave
thanks on Saturday, his opponent. Parish,
an Independent, threatened to try again:
afterwards, seizing his wife, he kissed her
loudly as a guarantee of good faith and utter
respectability. Still the public osculation was
hardly necessary, as the lady had petrolled
loads of lazy electors up to vote, with her
mascot, a long Persian cat, tucked under her
arm. Perhaps the beast should have been
black.
“The Old Soldier” fires a volley:—•
Soldiering isn’t H. G. Wells’s trade, or he wouldn't
have been so surprised at the Germans’ “thoroughness
and adaptability” in entrenching their position on
the Aisne after they were driven back from the
Marne. Judging by his article in London Chronicle
he imagines that the value of entrenchments has
just been discovered. Yet the Roman legions 2000
years ago used to entrench their camps every night
when on the march. In the wars of the last quarter
of the 17th and first half of the 18th centuries
entrenched lines just like those in France and Bel-
gium to-day were constantly used. They were not so
long certainly, but that was only because armies
were not large enough to either attack or defend
Fronts scores or hundreds of miles long. Says Wells:
“One of the marvellous maxims of the Dark Ages,
which seem to have been the chief reading of our
military experts, states: ‘An army which entrenches
is defeated.’” Who invented that maxim? I have
never heard of it, and it is quite foreign to British
or Frenfch practice. In 1809 Wellington entrenched
the British army in Portugal at Torres Vedras, and
remained there till the French army under Massena
had been starved out of the country. In that case it
was the army that didn’t entrench that was defeated.
In 1854 when the British and French armies besieged
Sebastopol, which had been fortified with field-works
like Torres Vedras in 1809, people were astonished
at the cleverness of the foreign engineer who did it.
though British engineers had done a similar job 45
years before. Entrenching is too good a thing to
have been made in Germany.

WINES
LOOKING AHEAD.
SNIPEY (offered his choice of fire pounds or two months): "Wot I wanter know is:
s'pose I take it out stead o' payin the coin, am I still elergible fer the old aye
pension?”
It seems to be three times more profitable
to sell rags than deal in groceries in Vic-
toria. Anyhow, the average amount of in-
come tax paid by the 470 drapers is £l2
9s. 7d„ while the 441 grocers only weigh in
with £4 11s. 4d. apiece. And there appears
to be more cash attached to being a clerk in
mercantile pursuits than a clerk in holy
orders, because the taxing office lifts £4 Os.
Bd. out of the first lot, but the parsons wash
up for no more than £2 10s. per head. Among
professional men Sawbones is apparently on
the best wicket, since his average contribu-
tion to the revenue is £l4 2s. 10d., Costs and
Co.'s being £ll 15s. But Costs gets most of
his income from investments: Sawbones
from personal exertion. There may be evi-
dence in this of Sawbones being a reckless,
improvident person, or it may only mean
that the family solicitor gets in first to the
property and mining markets. A broker
makes a little more than a medical man in
Melbourne, and he too gets most of it by
personal exertion. Bung manages to scrape
together a bit more than Cocky, but if any
citizen is in doubt about what to apprentice
his boys to, neither of these occupations can
compare with that of a grazier. The aver-
age hard-working grower of cattle and sheep
who pays anything at all hands over £26 11s.,
which is about 50 per cent, more than the
manufacturer passes out, and compares at
least favorably with the dairy-farmer’s
£3 3s.

“Bill O'Costs’’: The reconstitution of the
S. Aus. Supreme Court will help to remove
an old difficulty that often approached close
to a scandal. The parsimonious Wheat
State has struggled along for years with only
three Judges, making up for inadequate pay
by more than adequate work. With so few
Judges to call upon, some ingenuity has to
br resorted to get Banco business disposed
of, and occasionally a single Judge is found
sitting as the “Full Court,” in a desperate
attempt to catch up with arrears. Matters
of much gravity, such as appeals from a
single Judge, have usually to remain in abey-
ance until a full Bench can be made up. As
the “little Chief” was liable at any time to
be absent welcoming a wandering duke, re-
ceiving a Wesleyan archbishop or presiding
over something, suspended business —half-
heard appeals and so forth—had to be sus-
pended some more. “Adjourned to a day to
bi named” came to be a byword in the pro-
fesh, and Costs was the only party who made
any progress. Nevertheless anguished bar-
risters would be found imploring the Court to
“name a day,” and nasty questions would be
asked in Parliament and the newspapers.
When the satirists got “over the odds” the
Chief would buck in suddenly, deliver a year-
delayed judgment at five minutes’ notice to
everyone concerned, and then things would
relapse to the old state of postponement and
procrastination. I recall once the two puisne
Judges sitting in Banco and trying to arrange
the cause list in the big little-man’s absence.
Something had to be postponed again. Until
when? After much discussion it was found
that next Tuesday would suit everyone pre-
sent. Someone, however, broached the deli-
cate question. “Would there be then a —er —
fully constituted court?” Gordon, J., who
has a light touch, disposed of it. “I think
we’d better make it Tuesday week,” he
decided. “/ understand the Methodist Con-
ference icill be-over by then."
A LESSON IN GENDERS.
THE SMALL BOY: “Masculine, feminine — an' I forget the other, Miss!"
THE AUSTRALIAN GIRL: “Shirker!”
To the list of the dead towns of Australia
now add poor old Coolgardie, once the hub
ot the golden West. The other day the local
Municipal Council failed to raise a loan of
£5OO, and was told by its bankers to reduce
an overdraft of such dimensions that it
wouldn't equal the week's takings of two
peanut barrows. Since then the lamentable
place has shut its one public park and talks
seriously of pawning the Mayor’s robes.

Victoria's Liberal Administration profits
little by experience. Its Board of
Health chairman is Dr. Edward Rob-
ertson, . who has antiquated and wow-
serish ideas on the treatment —or non-
treatment —of venereal disease. Now, a
Midwifery Act having been passed, the
Cabinet has decided that the same Dr.
Robertson shall be a member of the new
Midwifery Board. The other members are
“Bill” Anderson, for many years secretary
to the Crown Law Department, and Janet
Lindsay Greig, one of Melbourne’s pioneer
woman-doctors. Dr. John Johnston is to be
secretary. Perhaps the presence of an enthu-
siast like Janet Greig will help Robertson
out of his rut; and there is some hope, too,
in the fact that neither Anderson nor John-
ston is in the municipal-nonentity class with
which Robertson is in the habit*of associat-
ing on the Board of Health.

“McNorth”: Gimme room! Up here on
Cape York, where half a dozen or so of us
are trying to turn a blackfellow's jungle into
a white man's garden, and where the nearest
overland settlement is many hundreds of
miles away, we get mails once a fortnight.
They come across the Strait from Thursdav
Island by motor-launch. Owing to local Pri-
vate Enterprise sending the price of this
service skyhigh there is a considerable
deficit, and the Postmaster-General’s Depart-
ment has asked us to fork out the amount
of the loss! As an alternative, it is hinted
that the service may be suspended, or at
any rate made much less frequent. Of course,
we have turned our blind ear to the proposal
chiefly because we can't afford to do other-
wise. What will be the result? We can’t
walk or ride to Thursday Island for our
budget of bills and the letters from the girl
because of the 20 miles of intervening water
So we shall remain in bitter ignorance of the
war lies and the latest murder and divorce
cases and the establishment of another postal
delivery in some Southern suburb. We shall
have to sit under the cocoanut palms, and
hail the passing pearling luggers, and ask
the Jap. divers how things are in the world.
If the service is suspended we mav wait for
weary months before hearing the news when
the Kaiser is hanged or Von Turnips has
had a shave. Maybe it serves us right for
daring to prove the possibilities of white
settlement in the Far North; but while
pmneers are satisfied to endure all sorts of
hardships cheerfully, they do like a little
news of the outer world occasionallv. Allah
knows we don't ask civilisation for much.
Melbourne morgue, with a well-kept lawn
and handy to the Melbourne Cricket Ground
and the Central Station, is becoming in-
creasingly popular. Last year G 97 guests
were accommodated, and the number of in-
quests—4o2—constitutes a record. Nine
findings of wilful murder were returned, and
194 cadavers were deemed to have happened
by accident. Thirty-four of this contingent
were defeated in debates with motor-vehicles;
seven of them won exemption from taxation
and the necessity of reading the war news
through the agency of the motor-bike, against
which no previous convictions had been
recorded here. Last year’s suicides num-
bered 74—an increase of 10. Poison
(mostly disinfectant) was the most popular
method of joining the great and growing
majority; shooting, throat cutting, hanging
and drowning followed in that order. About
the most tidy performance in this class was
that of a lady who locked herself in the
kitchen, lay on the floor with her head inside
the gas stove, and turned the tap.
IDEAL.
“How do you find the nurse I recom-
mended?"

On January 1 the closing hour of all pub
bars in Tasmania was brought back from
11.30 to 10 p.m. But this didn’t affect the
bars at theatres and such places, which were
not bound to close at any tixed time, but
could pull the cork for 30 minutes after the
show was over. Therefore these bars are
still open till 11, or with a little stretching
ot the programme till 11.30, and they do a
roaring trade after the other drinkeries are
shut up. The anomaly is so grotesque that
Parliament was hurried up to interfere, and
after April 1 patrons of the theatre and the
picture-show will have to swallow their last
dog before 10 o’clock.
THE NEW LEAF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Nell and I are married
I’ll start a better life;
Too long, too long I’ve tarried
To take to me for wife
Some pure, inspiring maiden
With noble thoughts and deeds,
With good examples laden
To minister my needs.
Oh, wickednesses cherished,
Get thee behind me now!
Good resolutions perished,
To thee I make this vow:
That from our wedding morning,
As strikes our marriage bell,
The old life I’ll be scorning—
Sure thing—l promised Nell l
The rum and lobster suppers,
The sing-song rolling home;
Though, maybe, on our uppers
Our highway led to Rome—
At least, we tried to think so,
Queer beer-lopsided fools—
And leer at each and wink so,
Mere self-deception’s tools.
Rut I’ll cut out that racket;
No more hot stuff for me.
The girl gave me a packet
Of hopes of what I’d be
When low companions banished,
And on the water-cart,
With all temptations vanished
From out my wicked heart.
She said that bright and early
I'd toddle off to work ;
My head would not be wliirlv;
The hours would never irk.
And while I toiled I’d whistle,
And leap about and sing,
With energy I’d bristle
Just like the calves in Spring.
At night she'd meet me beaming
With toast and buttered tea.
She said 'twould be like dreaming
(I’m sure it will to me)
To sit beside the ingle,
And, holding hand in hand,
To let our mute thoughts mingle
(It ought to beat .the band!).
Ah. yes; I need reforming.
Oh, sinful, dinful Past-
No more of that performing,
I'm quit of it at last.
And yet I’m not too breezy
With hope that all is well —■
I hope they all come easy,
The things I promised Nell.

“Padjud”: There is a reason for the
failure of the Wheatstone method of auto-
matic telegraphy in Australia (B. 20/1/T6)
—the rotten condition of the lines. The
Department has no organised scheme of
maintenance. The chief duty of a lineman
is to re-erect and prop up decrepit old poles
that have been toppled over by the last sheep
that rubbed against them. The result is
“heavy-working” lines, on which the signals
have to be literally punched out. (I know—
I’m one of the punchers.) “Auto”-speed is,
roughly, a word a second, which means about
20 distinct impulses of current in that time.
A line needs to be at concert-pitch to conduct
these fleeting flashes over hundreds of miles.
Deadness, or leakage of current, means that
the signals are bogged on the way, and
arrive at the other end blurred and mutilated
—frequently unreadable. On September 25
last 23 messages that had been lodged in
Brisbane before 10.15 that morning were lying
in a state of mutilation in the Sydney office
at 4 p.m. Scores of messages are delivered
every day on the “corrected copy to follow”
basis. Mutilations—or “corrections,” as they
’are called —average in Sydney a hundred
daily, and have been known to soar up to a
hundred and fifty. They are straightened out
on a handworked line, and often there are
two men, each receiving £2OO a year, doing-
nothing but attending to such repairs. After
years of trial the Wheatstone auto, system
was discarded in Maoriland. Yet it is a fine
system, and in the U.S.A. is a marvel of
smooth-working efficiency. On the lifeless
Australian lines it hasn’t a chance.
TWO CHANCES.
"Do you think your husband will care to see
yon in that costume?”
"If he doesn’t somebody else’s may.”
The resourceful Williamjim again. Last
week on the departure of a troopship a
soldier’s mother was on the wharf with a
written message for her boy. The lads on
the deck could not reach her hand, so one
of them took off his boot and let himself
down towards her. Then one of the tallest
ot the men on the wharf held the anxious
Indy up while she pinned the. message into
Jimwilliam’s sock good and secure.
Some of the citizens of Ballarat, where
there is a military camp, have been agitat-
ing for a pair of women police, to do special
duty in chasing Susy and her soldier on
the shore of Lake Wendouree. That most
extraordinary of ictorian police magis-
trates, Read Murphy, spoke in support of
the proposition the other evening; and as
a r , e r s ' l i! t: a l° ca l. organisation is going down
to Melbourne, with its lunch in a paper-bag,
prepared to squat on the Government’s door-
step until something is done in the matter.
When the facts and figures are available, the
women police already appointed in various
Australian cities will doubtless be found to
have earned their keep; but why the special
female-policing of Lake Wendouree? John
Hop. large-sized in boots and biceps, should
be better able to. protect Susy from the
clutch of khakied circumstance, if necessary.
What \ ictoria really needs isn’t a couple
ot coppesses, but about 250 more respectable
married coppers at good wages, with a
couple of dozen highly-paid detectives, chosen
on their brains and not on their feet.
* * * *
“Nail-Bender”: A hideous curse on the
good husband who potters about with ham-
mer and nails seeking what he may botch ! I
never put up a shelf or mended a fowlhouse
m my life, and, please God, I never will, for
I carp, not neither do I plumb, and I utterly
refuse to learn how. Long years ago I
decided that my genius did not lie that way.
But the average wife (all our wives are aver-
age m this matter) seems to look upon the
willing potterer as a safe domestic invest-
ment who will never succumb to drink or
chorus girls. She will throw fits of delight
round a husband’s home-made shelf that
would drive a professional to drink, while
coldly approving of a perfect professional job
for which an obliging husband has merely
paid good money. I have time and again re-
fused to win the domestic V.C. and the re-
newed esteem of my wife by spoiling some
good material. I refuse to potter, however
mildly, and the bitter things I am driven to
say of Blither’s amateur shelfry or Bun-
thumper’s fowlhousing almost persuade my
wife that I am a jealous and mean-spirited
hound. Some day a better-organised world
will prosecute the willing incompetent who
messes about at a job he can’t do. Till that
day comes we intelligent idlers will have to
suffer the reproaches of our wives in silence.

The other day a Sydney man who had gone
to the usual establishment to have his whisk-
ers assassinated got the shock of his life
when the barber, after lathering him nicely
and putting an edge on his razor, remarked:
“You know, I’m as mad as a hatter.” The
artist then got
busy, talking all
the time of his
madness. He said
he was assured
that some day he
would cut a custo-
mer’s throat, but
he was particular
about the kind of
throat, and he was
not quite sure
that the customer’s
classic column
suited his ideas.
Scared to death,
but frightened of
angering the man
with the razor, the
shivering citizen
hung on until
the beard-removing
operation was fin-
ished ; then he
bolted from the
shop, and searched
for a policeman.
Two returned with
him ; and agonised
shrieks from the
saloon set their
boots fluttering
feverishly. At tjie
end of the final
sprint they found
a soap-bespattered
person who was struggling with the barber.
“The fool won’t let me shave him,” said the
barber, angrily, “although I tell him that I
don’t think his throat’s the sort I’d like to
cut.”
* * * *
“Yarra Ben”: I ate stale bread all
through the Christmas festivities that lasted
either four or 40 days—l can’t remember
which. I also ate stale bread through the
New Year holidays that are still going on
more or less as I write. I don’t complain.
All I want to do is to point out tlffit next
Monday the Melbourne bakers (or half-time
bakers, if you like) have then I —-yes —their
holiday; and once again we shall get no
fresh bread from the Saturday until the
following Tuesday. It’s all right for me—-
I shall revel in the hard loaf. But I feel
sorry for those of the public who like occa-
sionally to sample a little fresh bread.
DESPERATION.
SHORTY: “A hat with th’ price of beer an ’
th’ bloomin’ income-tax, I’ve er good
mind to go to th’ Front.”
“Hamer”: Some fine records in war-giving
have been put up in Australia; but there
are achievements of another kind. The
Parramatta Soldiers’ Amelioration Fund
circularised 250 of Joe Cook’s orchardists
for fruit to be sold at a sports meeting, and
got just three replies to . the appeal, the.
actual donations being three cases of fruit
and a bag of vegetable marrows. Instead
of having a surplus for sale, the committee
in charge of matters had to rush out
hurriedly with a handful of small change
and buy fruit for the refreshment of the
warriors.
* * * *
“Bolwarrah”: If anyone is interested in
the champion war-ecQnomist I have his
address. Three months ago my brother
sailed in khaki for Egypt, and, on the way,
being anxious to accomplish something novel,
emptied a bottle, put a letter addressed to a
girl in Melbourne into the interior, and
threw the dead ’un overboard. It was lately
picked up on the S. Aus. coast by a good
sport, who promptly wrote to the addressee
informing her of the salvage, and intimating
that. the letter would be sent to her on
receipt of the necessary postage, viz., Id. and
the postage on his own letter of advice (Id.).
“D.F.”: The Tasmanian Government has
talked a lot about grappling with the hous-
ing problem, but all it has done has not
given many grey hairs to Private Enterprise.
It has built seven cottages, some of four
rooms costing £375, and some of five costing
£450, and lets them for 12s. and 14s. per
week respectively, which is much the same
as the private landlord rakes in for the same
sized cottage. The Government wanted to
put £5OOO into a dozen more humpies, but
the House of Dodery wasn’t taking any
risks. In any case the plans need altering.
In some of these “model homes” a bedroom is
Bft. Sin. by Bft. At 10ft.' high this gives
600 cubic feet of air space, while in most
of the cells even in Hobart Gaol they
give the prisoners 600 feet, and in modern
prisons 900 feet is reckoned the thing.
* * * *
“Wal Bus” reports a misunderstanding:—■
I was waiting my turn at the booking office of a
railway station a bit the other side of Newcastle.
“Give me two tickets and a half-ticket for Gor-
don,” said the lady in front.
“Two pounds two-and-eleven, please,” said the
clerk, as he handed over the pasteboard.
“Dear mo,” said the lady, “you are making a mis-
take. We only paid eleven-and-three coming up.”
“Well,” said the booking clerk, “if that’s so the
man who sold you the tickets will never forget you
after next pay day.” -:'i
The lady appealed to her husband, who jumped into
the argument and handed out a lot of remarks about
inefficiency, mismanagement, robbery, etc.
Just here the lady looked at the tickets.
“Why, you have given me tickets for Gordon.”
“That’s what you asked for, madam.”
“Oh, no,” said the lady sweetly. “Gordon is my
little hnv.”
“The Oldest In-
habitant” : The pos-
sibility of the North
Shore bridge materi-
alising in the next
decade recalls a
bridge mentally pro-
jected which never
materialised at all.
Potter McQueen,
who ruined himself
in the ’3o‘s in con-
testing a House of
Commons seat (Bed-
fordshire), had a
large grant of land
given him at Aber-
deen (N.S.W.) to
salve the wound. A
question had been
raised by the Colo-
nial Office as to
the most practicable
means of communi-
cation between Van
Diemen’s Land and
Port Phillip, the lat-
ter just forging out.
A Committee of In-
quiry was appointed
and summoned Mc-
Queen to give evi-
dence, as he had jiist
returned from a visit
to his grant in N. S.
Wales. When he
entered the room,
“Mr. MeQ u e e n,”
said the chairman,
“will you be good
enough to join us
here in our consul-
tation? You know
the desire of the
Government to bring
together more closely
the magnificent coun-
try of Van Diemen’s
Land with Port
Phillip on the mainland of Australia. Now.
here is the map. which is doubtless faithful.
This water is the only separation, and is nar-
row enough to look at. It is proposed to throw
a bridge across. Will you give us the benefit
of your views on the scheme?” A bridge
across Bass Straits ! The wisdom of Dowu-
ing-street!

If this old Empire doesn’t sink it won’t
be for want of holes bored from the inside.
When the Maoriland hospital ship Maheno
was due to sail from Malta to M.L. recently
with sick soldiers, the stokehole crew, who
had fired her that far, refused further duty.
The engineers shovelled enough coal to move
the vessel outside the three-mile limit, where
the master asked the men if they would be
kind enough to resume. They refused, the
Maheno was taken back to the island and the
firemen and trimmers given a poor little
three months’ hard. Then Maltese firemen
were engaged; and now the Maheno has
been hung up in M.L. because the seamen
have refused to go aboard while the Maltese
are there. And away up in the Medi-
terranean Maorilanders are probably dying
for lack of the relief the Maheno could bring
them.
THE STRAIGHT TIP.
THE DAME”: “Think I’ll get across in this
rig-out ?”
THE "BOY”: "Dunno. But you ought to get
across and make a hit in mine."
WHEN I AM DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
VICTORIA.
When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me;
And plant no roses on my grave,
Nor shady cypress tree;
For I would much prefer, dear,
That you should sow instead
Some hops, of flow’rs the sweetest.
Above my lowly head.
When I am dead, my dearest,
No sculptured urn I crave;
A beer-mug done in marble
I’d have above my grave,
With cynical inscription,
And thus I might contrive
To be, when dead, the devil
I never was alive.

Both Vic. and N, S. Wales this year un-
earthed something promising in prodigies.
The Vic. youngster is a boy, Bertram Bal-
lard. just turned 13, who, besides topping
the list of candidates for a State scholarship
with a record number of marks, also quali-
fied for scholarships at no less than four
colleges. The N. S. Wales scorcher is
Beatrix Durie, of the old-established Fort-
street school, who, after doing hitherto un-
heard-of things at the “senior,” led the State
in three subjects—mathematics and lan-
guages—and was second in a fourth in the
“leaving” examinations.
_ Maoriland is beginning to have a suspi-
cion that when Liverpool was imported to
relieve the affable Islington of the job of
wearing the local cocked hat which cements
the Empire, it achieved the finest thing in
the way of a talking parrot it has yet had.
The other day he sent a cable message to
the Czar “on behalf of myself, the Govern-
ment and people,” expressing satisfaction at
the way the Bear was performing along the
Front. And whenever the firebell rings
Liverpool has a habit of leaping into his
uniform and calling Massey and Ward out
to a conference on the safety of the Empire.
THE PROBLEM.
THE PATRON: “A problem picture, eh?
What's the problem?”
THE ARTIST: “How to sell it!”
Still another of The Bulletin’s black-
and-white contributors changes his color to
khaki. Booth (killed), Colics and Hartt
have been doing their bit; now Lance Mat-
tinson. of Perth, sends the last of bis draw-
ings before going into camp.
The late Mrs. Goldstein, Vida’s mother,
who died the other day in Melbourne, was a
member of the Hawkins family which in the
early days squatted at JVlelville Forest, Port-
land. The lady was a “Christian scientist”
of the first water, and remained an Eddyite
until the very last, flatly refusing to see a
medical man ; but near the end, unknown to
the dying lady, a doctor was summoned and
did what_ he could. The cult will find small
comfort in the fact that, while Mrs. Gold-
stein lay on her deathbed, a daughter was on
her way back from the home of “Christian
science” in the U.S., where for some time
she had been studying its latest and more
carefully revised phases—and perhaps com-
paring the earlier and ungrammatical edi-
tions of Mary Baker Eddy’s writings with
the literary products of her later years. In
spite of the general tendency of the family
to sing “I Didn’t Raise My Son to Be a
Soldier,” Selwyn, the only Goldstein boy, is
ou active service.
THE OBVIOUS.
TALKATIVE GENTLEMAN WHO DRINKS
ALONE: “Yes, sir, there is not the slight-
est doubt about it; money is tight, con-
foundedly tight.”
THE GENTLEMAN WHO WASN'T ASKED TO
HAVE ONE: "There ain’t any need to
mention it. Car n’t a bloke see it’s
tight?”
Dave McGrath, Labor M.H.R. for Bal-
larat, lias been accepted for active service.
He volunteered lately, and the M.O. told
him he was too stout. Wherefore he spent
his days on low diet, and his nights in quiet
living—quieter than ever, that is—and
brought his waist-measurement down to that
of his chest in time to make one of the
50,000. There's a son at the Front looking
out for dad’s arrival.
“Bunt” Wilson, one of the founders of
the modern woollen industry in Australia,
had the life smashed out of him in a South-
ern Cross (W.A.) mine the other day. Wilson
landed in Victoria 30 years ago with £23.000
and put il all in the woollen ousiness. But
the stinking-fish Australian was howling
then, and the foreigner could do everything
better, and he lost the lot. Then he tackled
hard work and died at it.
There is a Bar rumor that Justice Simp-
son. N.S.W. Chief Justice in Equity, whose
hearing isn't what it used to be, intends to
retire when he has completed his 20th year
of service. He was appointed November
20, 1800. and is the senior Puisne Judge.
There is but one Supreme Court judicial
pensioner now, Mathew Henry Stephen,
who retired in 1904. The pension is fixed in
N. S. Wales at seven-tenths of the salary.
Chris Bennett, president of the Trades
Hall Council at Melbourne, and a member
of the P.L.C. Executive which tore up the
recent Katz resolution into small pieces,
distinguished himself lately by dissolving
an anti-conscription meeting at the Trades
Hall. “Those who wish to make speeches
against recruiting,” roared Bennett, stand
iug alone amid the tumult of 200 angry men,
while a daily-paper reporter made hasty
notes from a safe place under a table, “wiil
have to go somewhere else —and I advise
you not to be led away by those who advise
persons not to enlist.” Half the meeting
left: but the police had to be called in to
disperse the other half and the proceedings
closed with the intrepid Christopher intact.
Bennett is secretary to the Blacksmiths’
Society, and at the last State elections
opposed Alf Billson, of the Country Party,
in the contest for the Ovens seat, scoring so
many votes that the local farmer sat up
and looked twice at himself to make sure
he wasn’t a Socialist in disguise.
Old Donald Sutherland, the pioneer of Mil-
ford Sound (M.L.), has the other sort of
visitors’ hook. The usual sort contains the
vapid remarks of the visitor about the
sights and the guides; Donald’s contains the
usual signatures with the old man’s remarks
about the visitors. Thus concerning Tam
MacKenzie, the High Commissioner who
bagged a knighthood the other day, it is
written: “Bump of self-importance, tremen-
dous. Bump of locality, nil. Turn him
round twice and he’s bushed.” Someone took
up a page of the book with an account of
several climbs he made in the vicinity, but
room was left for Donald to squeeze in:
“Don’t believe him. He cleared out owing
me £8 for board.”
Of a king who isn’t at war: —
A birthday notice of Old King Cole, in the Book
Lover, recalls a fateful incident in his early life.
Born in England, he was just beginning to fed
adventurous when the Crimean War broke out, so he
went to Chatham Barracks to ’list for a soldier. lie
misr-ed the mark by quarter of an inch. Two years
later the gold rush to Australia attracted the enter-
prising little man, and after knocking around 1 ic-
toria and N.S.W. for another 10 years he started a
bookstall in the Eastern Market, Melbourne. Then
he opened his Book Arcade in Bourke-street, and it
has been growing for 42 years. Had lie been quarter
of an inch taller Cole would have died young in the
Crimea or developed into a different sort of veteran
to the mild Arcadian whose business is the outcome
of his eccentric talent for advertisement. Bernard
Shaw is a crude amateur in the art compared with
Cole. There’s an air of pure benevolence about the
Arcadian’s boosting of himself and his business. Even
his unaffected kindliness is an advertisement. Some
business men will tell you that they can’t afford to
be amiable. Cole can. To his other notorieties it
has added the notoriety of being a trader who always
keeps kindliness in stock.
The estate of the late Chief Justice Way
in Adelaide has been sworn not to exceed
£55,000. As he died a widower, and child-
less, he has been generous to all kinds of in-
stitutions. His fine library goes to the
Methodist Church (so far as books and
documents about it are concerned) ; to the
University, the Public Library and the
Supreme Court, each of which can take, in
turn, whatever it may “think proper.” His
pictures can be dealt with similarly by the
State’s Art Gallery. In cash the University
—of which he was Chancellor —gets £2OOO,
and the Children’s Hospital £lOOO. Angli-
cans, Roman Catholics and Salvation Army
are all remembered, and also everyone in
the old lawyer’s employment. The trustees
are new Chief Justice Murray. Judge
Buchanan and Grundy, Iv.C., and they have
the power to carry on his stock-breeding
operations at his two places in the country.
ELLERY, Town Clerk of Melbourne, telling
a funny story.
Alfred Ozanne. Labor M.11.R. for Corio,
"ho has a certain amount of military know-
ledge, enlisted the otlier day. and was passed
by the doctor. Some time ago Ozanne wrote
to the Defence authorities, offering his ser-
' ices for home use. Since then, however, a
brother has been killed at the Front: and
now the M.11.R. feels that the Front is the
only place for him.
Corporal Cyril Bassett, Maoriland’s first
V.C. in the present war, is not the only fight-
ing member of the family. His dad, Chax.
F. Bassett, a printer in Auckland, turned

WHEN THE TOES GET WARM.
FROZEN FEET: “When will this blooming war

CHEERFUL RETURNED: “Oh, ice'll have a

John Gilbert, who died at Penrith
(N.S.W.) last week, aged 72, used to bo
manager of the Minchinbury Vineyards,
which he really created —in 1867 he planted
out the first vines and cut the first grapes
in 1869. Of course the estate is much older.
Minchinbury was, in fact, a grant to Lieu-
tenant Minchin. of the N, S. Wales Corps,
who was officer of the guard at Government
House when Colonel Johnston and his
braves arrested Governor Bligh.
Cracked his whip for the last time the
other day Hiram Crawford, who in the
“roaring” days made a specialty of running
coaches to and from the Victorian goldfields.
Hiram, who hailed from U.S.A., established
himself in business in Victoria ’way back in
’56. In ’B2 he went to look for the codlin
moth on an orchard at Everton, near Beech-
worth, and there his name was long ago
written in the Book of Useful Pioneers.
Gordon Tidy, the Anglican parson who
caused some sensation at Bathurst (N.S.W.)
u ow , years back by ’verting suddenly to
“Rome” and then ’verting back again some
months later, contributes an introduction to
a new illustrated edition of Cardinal New-
man s “Dream of Gerontius,” just published
in England. Tidy was one of the most
cultured of Australian clerics, and did a good
deal of scholarly literary work in Sydney
when he was one of parson Carr Smith's
at St. James’s. lie is now a curate in
the West of England.
John Myles, best known at Bulli. is herein-
commended foi* holding his end up. The
virile young Australian—he is onlv 69
wlule on a shooting trip to the Deerpark
district (N.S.W. North Coast) lately,
strayed from the paths that lead to Me’l-
drum. For eight days he wandered through
the scrub, killing his own tucker while the
cartridges lasted, and subsisting on birds’
eggs afterwards, eventually strolling on to
a river farm little the worse for wear. Who
says the Australian is old at 95?
N.T. : Dr. Goldstein, now of Java, is a
Tpiman all right (B. 13/l/’l0), but not a
single Ludwig or Karl is to he found among
the Goldstein clan in Melbourne. There is
a Barnett and a David, an Israel, a Nathan
and an Isaac—all decent British front-
names nowadays, and several Gentiles who
show, no indication of being anything hut
Bntish stock. Wherefore Vida Goldstein,
of the Peaceful Pessimists, whose family has
no German hallmarks either, may reasonably
be acquitted of any racial sympathy with
the Ivaiser more particularly as her young
brother. Selwyn Goldstein, is a second-lieu-
tenant with the Royal Engineers. Vida's
riouble is simply that she will insist on
talking concerning the brutality of war and
the woes of women, just as though that
v asn t the best of reasons for smashing the
ravisher of Belgium. Poland and Servia.
Really she does it because talking of the
brutality of men and the wrongs of women
i> tier vocation. But without any personal
malice, most people agree that what Vida
needs just now is a vacation.
NOBODY SHOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nobody has been shot in Great Britain for military
offences, —! r )/ftcial statement.
Never the curtain of the morning rose
Upon a haggard sceaie of shame and woe;
Never the evening at its tragic close
Beheld the slayers in a ghastly row
Waiting the awful word to make an end
Of one they knew as comrade, mate or friend.
No one was shot at all. The British skies
Wept not their rain of sorrow on the head
Of any wretch from whose distorted eyes
Looked awful curses as a traitor bled.
The statement reassures us. Not one blank
Was made for Justice' sake in any rank.
l'reely we breathe. Wild rumor floating by
Gave the impression that on Britain's shore
The files of those condemned in shame to die
Had sprinkled half the land with treason’s gore.
No one was shot. Yet, crowned with laurels green,
A few sit smiling who . might well hare been.

Six months ago profits crashed down without
any other explanation than the circum-
stances of the times; but now they have
come back to their previous level. For a good
while past it has been suspected that general-
manager Heron was playing for safety;
and the figures for these two terms sup-
port the theory. Six months ago, with
one very bad season in ATctoria and S. Aus.
behind and an uncertain one ahead, any cau-
tious management would reckon it the right
thing to provide liberally for contingencies;
and no doubt this was done. Since then
both Victoria and S. Aus. have had a
bumper harvest, and it looks as though the
farmers will get a first-rate price if they
wait, Avhile a very firm wool market goes a
long way towards compensating for the
recent losses of stock. So a lot of creditors
who would have been very sick with another
bad year are now asking the branch manager
if he’s too busy following the King to come
across the road for a minute.
And. anyway, apart from the effect that
variations in profit may have on the price of
shares (and the management is notoriously
unconcerned about that), it doesn’t yet
matter very much what profit the bank dis-
closes so long as it discloses more than
£42,347 in the half-year. That is enough
to pay the pref. shares 4 p.c., and they
can’t get any more. Anything made be-
yond that is put by ; and it isn’t of much
consequence whether it is written off openly
or put in the stocking to be shaken out in
the cleaning-up that must take place sooner
or later. Certainly there are ordinary shares,
and they are hungering for a bite; but,
although it was proposed 18 months ago to
give them one, anything like that, is out of
the question until the world gets down to
regular business again. When the bank had
its awful smash in the early ’nineties the
nursing of the sickest of the assets was
handed over to a Trust, which has nearly
finished its job. Only assets valued at £15,229
remain to be disposed of. But unfortu-
nately in the realisation of assets heavy
losses have been made; and though the table
printed above shows a reserve of £11,386,
there is really a deficit, according to the
accounts of the bank and the Trust lumped
together, of £734,274. The following shows
the position :—•

That is to say, of the total capital of
£2,213,009 the accounts show that only
£1,478,735 is intact. The capital is made
up this way
211,735 £lO shares fullv-paid .. £2,117,350
191,318 10/- shares fully-paid .. 95,659
The £lO shares are prefs.; the others are
ordinaries, and every share has the same
voting value. The ordinaries represent all
that is left of the old capital; the pref.
capital consists of old deposits converted
into shares, and not entitled to more than
4 p.c. Theoretically, no doubt, the ordin-
ary capital ought to be wiped right out,
Since it isn’t represented by any assets
whatever; but if that was to be done at
all it ought to have been done long ago.
In a general way all profit made over the
prefs.’ 4 p.c. belongs to ordinaries: and if
they don't draw it now, it accumulates for
their benefit. At various times it has been
suggested that in order to put things more
shipshape the pref. capital should be written
down, which would remove the objection to
paying the ordinaries a dividend. Some
such step is desirable, because it cannot be
in the best interests of a bank to have one
lot of shares always at a heavy discount,
and another lot which pay no dividend at
allbut the parties show no disposition to
come to an agreement.
The balance-sheet figures as at December
31 compare with those of a year ago as fol-
lows :

The growth of the free deposits is no doubt
due to the indisposition of the public
to make any permanent investments apart
from the War Loan. That loan may also ex-
plain the shrinkage in deposits at interest.
Advances have increased substantially;
farmers are doubtless being helped over
harvest and squatters over their wool sales.
There is a shrinkage, no doubt temporary,
in liquid assets in consequence, and the hold-
ing is down quite as low as it ought to be.
However, the liabilities in proportion to
shareholders’ funds is not at all excessive
—£s to £l—and the depositors’ security is
therefore quite satisfactory, especially as
there is every reason to believe that the
assets are worth every penny of their book
value.

The half-year’s profit is all the better be-
cause of the announceinent made by the
chairman six months ago that the bank had
just got rid of the last of its station pro-
perties. What has been made now is conse-
quently bank profit and not a more or less
accidental punch from the sale of live beef-
steak or mutton-chop. But it is not only
the profit figures that are good: the balance-
sheet items show steady improvement:—

Assuming that the bank has been taking
only good business (and there is still some
of that sort to be had), the increase in the
advances is particularly cheerful. The
A.B.C. can stand a lot of that. Reckoning
the inscribed deposits as capital, the bank’s
own funds amount to £2,870,522, and the
advances are only £4,187,098. A bank whose
past never made people think of its future
might comfortably have three or four times
as much money out in advances as the aggre-
gate of its own funds. If, for instance, the
A.B.C. had the same amount of advances in
proportion to its funds as the Commercial
of Sydney—a very conservatively-managed
neighbor—it would now be collecting in-
terest on £10.750,000 instead of £4,187,098.
That shows the strength and size of the
foundation which the A.B.C. has to build on.
Of course it couldn’t lend £10,000.000
now, even if the business was available,
because it hasn’t the necessary deposits.
But when it wants the -money it ought to
be able to get it. In ordinary circum-
stances it is reckoned a fair thing if an Aus- -
tralian bank’s funds are equal to one-eighth
of its deposits and other liabilities: in Eng-
lish banks one-tenth or less. This bank at
present, however, holds in deposits and
other terminable debts £3,457,563. and its
own funds are £2,870,522. Especially in
view of the fact that the assets were written
down severely six years ago, and that the
capital was carved to the bone to corres-
pond, these figures ought to command a few
millions of deposits when they are wanted.
Xo doubt there has been a bit of an un- :
easy feeling that, though the principal might
be all right, the assets might not be of a
good, reliable interest-producing sort. On
that point something has been said already, l
There was a time when the A.J.S., from
whose ashes the A.B.C. sprang, was chiefly
an undertaker, engaged in disposing of the
corpses of squatting properties. But the
A.B.C. is a bank, and there is no good
reason why it shouldn’t be a big one. And
its earnings seem as sure as any other’s.
I
It has been assumed in the foregoing that
the inscribed deposits form part of the
bank’s capital. For all practical purposes
this is so. The bank is, however, under an
obligation to retire £20,000 of these deposits
each half-year. This repayment is so grad-
ual that the last of the money will not be
called for in less than about 40 years; and
meantime a reserve fund, which will give
greater security to creditors inasmuch as it
will involve no interest, will be accumula-
ting. Thus in the last three years the 1
visible additions have exceeded half the total
amount of inscribed deposits repaid. On
the other hand, from the shareholders’ point
of view the very strength of the position—
the excessive proportion of capital to other
liabilities and to advances —signifies not
only small profits p.c., but most likely a
slow climb from the present 3 p.c. dividend.

The variation in this bank’s profits suggests
that it hasn’t got much of an internal re-
serve. The ordinary bank more or less
equalises its profits by the simple process
of chopping off a bit when it thinks it has
had an extra-good term, and drawing upon
this undisclosed contingency fund when any-
thing unusual happens and the true figures
for the period would give a wrong idea of
the business and its prospects. There is
nothing immoral about this: you can’t
rightly call it faking, because as a rule what
you may think is exceptionally profitable
business may by and" bye turn out to be
rotten at the core, and the exceptionally
bad results in a half-year may really be the
legacy of a term in which everything in the
garden looked lovely. The City, however,
never has been quite like most other banks,
and it seems to follow its own inclinations
in this matter.
It has had a long struggle; and that
again was largely due to its habit of going
its own way. Others, having lost a lot of
money when the boom broke in the early
’nineties, wrote off capital. The City, in-
stead of doing that, set to work to restore
its losses out of profits. Unfortunately no-
body outside knew the size of the hole that
had to be filled up, so both borrowing and
lending customers were inclined to stand off,
and those who did come in were mostly per-
suaded that way by the personal representa-
tions of somebody or other “inside.” But,
unfortunately again, the policy decided upon
handicapped the bank inasmuch as it didn’t
allow it to show the progress that was really
being made, because, though a lot of good,
profitable business was secured, it often
merely displaced old, sad business which
had been finally got rid of. However, even
with this handicap, progress has been shown
in the past 10 years :—•

Deposits have thus increased in the 10 years
by 107 p.c., liquid assets (including public
securities) by 119 p.c., and advances by
63 p.c. And the profits for the past six
months are just double those of the corres-
ponding half of 1905. The actual increases,
stated in f s. d., are not what a bank nearly
60 years old should have scored in a period
of exceptional prosperity; but the percent-
ages at any rate aFe all right—which sug-
gests that the bank was sounder asleep in
the first 40 than it has been in the last 10
years. In the past 12 mbnthsy despite
drought and war, the improvement has been
well maintained. Both deposits and advances
show satisfactory expansion, though the
directors affirm that “we have not sought
to increase our business in the form of new
advances, finding full employment for our
resources in meeting the legitimate require-
ments of old customers.”
Incidentally the chairman, addressing
shareholders at the meeting, used a quota-
tion which Federal Treasurer Higgs might
well have thrown at the heads of the bankers
who waited on him a couple of days later
to beg leave to export gold from the Com-
monwealth. A. J. Gould, Senator and chair-
man, had been talking about the big issue of
Australian notes, and went on to quote Sir
B. H. Inglis Pal grave, “our greatest Eng-
lish authority on Banking and Economics” :
We can well understand that English people
using currency notes in the ordinary transactions of
life may have no idea of the influence which the
employment of them in ordinary business may have
on prices in this country. If it‘is intended to super-
sede specie by the use of paper, care should be
taken that the paper issued should not exceed the
amount of specie which it takes the place of. and
this it not by any means an easy thing to secure.
When issued by a public office ari undue amount of
paper may be easily placed in circulation, and its
influence will be the greater if that paper is not
readily convertible into gold on demand.
As long as the gold is in this country the
£42,000,000 of notes which we have issued
are “readily convertible into gold”; but if
we send it to the U.S.A. to pay for Yankee
notions the very condition which the “great-
est English authority on banking” warns
us against is likely to arise.

Except the London office all this bank's
branches are in Victoria, and nearly all of
them are in country districts which suffered
badly last year from drought. This of itself
would be quite enougn to explain a shrink-
age of eight or 10 thousand in the earnings.
The war, too, has done more harm than good
to the figures. For though it has put a
great deal of borrowed money into circula-
tion, to the temporary advantage of the
worker and the permanent advantage of the
speculator and a few traders who are fatten-
ing on war profits, it has interfered with
ordinary foreign exchange operations, and
has made the banks just as chary as other
people about taking on new business.
The Bank of Victoria has always had
the support of the “Money” Miller family,
and there is a lot of other woolly affluence
behind it; and for that reason it isn’t per-
haps a fair thing to judge it entirely by
ordinary standards. But first take this com-
parison :

Count up liabilities, and the total is
£0,963,157 ; -and the liquid assets (including
Government stock) amount to £1,873,585.
That is to say, only 27 p.c. of the debts to
the public are held liquid. That is a pro-
portion which would cause alarm if the
figures were published by almost any other
bank. But the Victoria has resources which
a good many others haven’t; and apparently
when it wants more money it can get it.
Nevertheless there will be people who will
persist in reminding themselves that a quid
in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Whatever the conditions this at least can
be said: on its present funds the Victoria
is trading up to what is generally regarded
as the very limit of safety.
Coin, bullion, Australian notes and cash at
bankers total £1,242,090; and the free
deposits—all or practically all at call —total
£2.556,530. This looks like taking a risk.
Whether it is what it looks like depends
upon a dozen things. For instance, the
deposits may be chiefly the property of men
who are so bound up with the prosperity of
the bank that they would no more call for
their current account money than for their
fixed deposits supposing the bank were in
trouble. But the question whether one bank
has too little gold in the till is really not of
much practical consequence nowadays, be-
cause no bank can afford to see a “run”
mania fanned by a failure. The more im-
portant point is as to the ability of a bank
to stand not a swift run but a catastrophic
fall in securities. Apart from the character
of the securities, that depends chiefly upon
the . size of the shareholders’ funds in com-
parison with the public’s money at stake.
Here, for instance, on December 31 the
bank’s own funds totalled £1,947,124, and
the public’s £6,963,159—0n1y about £3 12s.
of the . public’s to £1 of the shareholders’,
which is a very safe figure indeed. Or put
it way. The bank owes the public
£6.963,159. Deduct £1,873,585 which is
liquid, and there is £5,059,574 left, against
which there is no less than £6,697,83S of
advances and £338,860 in premises and other
estate. Even if you forget all about the
internal or contingency reserve which no
doubt the manager has tucked away some-
where, these figures show that something
very dreadful could happen to the assets
before creditors would have any occasion to
feel uncomfortable.
Yankees are sniffing at Tasmania’s un-
exploited deposits of iron-ore. A well-known
l nited States steel firm has written to the
Minister for Mines asking for information
the iron-ore at the Blythe River on
the North-West Coast and elsewhere. The
biggest deposits known in the State—at
Ilfracombe, on the river Tamar —are at pre-
sent reserved from leasing for fear specula-
tors should get hold of them, but the Min-
ister says that if ironmasters want to make a
bona-fide attempt to work them they can have
the show whether their capital comes from
L.S.A. or anywhere else —except Germany.
An effort_ was made to work these deposits
about 1870, but the ore contained too much
sulphur for the process then used, though
it might not be reckoned much of a difficulty
now. A year or so ago Premier Earle offered
iaaaa ie I’ e deral Government have up to
10,000 liorse-power of electric energy cheap
it it would start ironworks in Tas., but
nothing has been heard of the idea lately.
Recently visited Kiandra
(N.B.VV.) and was surprised to learn that
nothing has been done by the Government
in the way of boring to locate the ancient
river bed. This has been worked extensively
by tunnels at New Chum'Hill and at the
J-Mile, but nowhere else has there been any
practical effort to trace it. For many miles
there is a succession of basalt-capped hills,
winch indicate the north and south course
of the old river. Anywhere else in the world
these lulls would have been bored in sections
to, determine the deep points, and thus afford
reliable data for tunnelling schemes. Not
having this necessary information co-opera-
tiye. parties have wasted energy in
driving long tunnels which have proved
ti> be too shallow. I am satisfied that if the
Alines Department would utilise its drilling
plants to locate the leads in these hills, there
would be no lack of willing workers to under-
take the tunnelling. Much better would it
lie to spend £5OOO of the prospecting vote
on such a scheme, which might lead to big
results, than to fritter away that amount
in £oo here and £lOO there to serve no pur-
pose other than provide tucker for prospec-
tors. . Another point in connection with the
held is that there should be systematic scien-
tific research to determine, if possible, the

into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal'. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

source of the rich deposits of coarse gold
in the main river and its tributaries. That
it was not shed from quartz reef is amply
proved by the fact that at most of the dig-
gings quartz is conspicuously absent. As
diorite is the principal rock in the drifts the
probability is that the gold came from dykes
in that formation and these have escaped
the attention of prospectors. The popula-
tion of Kiandra now is to be counted by tens
as against thousands in the time of its
glory in the early ’6o’s, and its gold produc-
tion' is fewer pounds than it then was tons.
There is no hope of its regaining its former
fame, but the chances are that if its deep-
leads system were properly developed it
would become a large producer.

Sulphide Corporation’s accounts to June
last have wandered back in their usual
leisurely way from London. Though the
works at Broken Hill were closed down for
months the high price of metals gave the
co. a net profit of £286,000, as against
£165,228 in the preceding year; and the
greater part of the extra money ought to go
to the nation which has been paying it away
to fight for the Sulphide and other corpora-
tions. There shouldn’t be any such thing
as war profits; it is monstrous to permit
old men to bleed their country for such pro-
fits as they never dreamed of before while
young men are being asked to fight and give
their lives for it. The Federal Government
has been engaged in a wild whirl of words
about German shareholders in Australian
cos. —a matter of very little practical con-
sequence. It would show a better apprecia-
tion of the needs of the crisis if it got to
work on this question of war profits.

Lloyd’s Burraga Co. (N.S.W.) talks
about resuming operations. Shareholders
are asked to make an advance of Is. 6d. per
share to provide funds. The amount thus
raised will have preference for dividends.
With the steadily advancing value of copper
since the war started the wonder is that the
co. has so long delayed the resumption of
work. A flotation plant had been installed
just prior to the last stoppage, and other-
wise everything was left in readiness, so that
it ought not to be long before the smelters
are runping. With copper looking well to-
wards £lOO and likely to keep there for sev-
eral months, the present campaign at Bur-
raga ought to be highly successful. But to
expect the mine to redeem the capital which
has been squandered in it during the past
15 years is to look for the impossible.

Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has got into
holts with the Boulder Council and Mines
Department over the nuisance caused by its
mountainous tailings dump—Mount Vensu-
vius, as it is known locally. When the wind
blows from the north or west, which is very
often, South Boulder’s backyards and house-
tops are plastered with grey dust. The
Council recently earmarked £2OO to carry the
matter to court, but the Minister for Mines,
after a personal inspection, has taken up
the cudgels on its behalf and proposes to pro-
secute the co.

Melbourne has washed its hands of the
Broncho Horseshoe (W.A.), and a local co.
has taken it on. A 15-liead mill is to be
installed, and as working costs are expected
to be very low the new crowd hopes to make
a do of things. But the only way that large
low-grade bodies like the Broncho’s can be
made to pay in the West is by spending
a great deal of money on equipment and
development, and the time isn’t opportune
for that.

Boulder’s lost lode is proving a great help
to the Golden Horseshoe. Developments on
it in the last year or two have added con-
siderably to the Horseshoe’s reserves, and
at the 3020 ft. level —the deepest point to
which it has so far been followed —134 ft. of
driving on a shoot Oft. wide has exposed ore
worth £7 per ton.

George Stephenson, an interested Lon-
doner who unexpectedly appeared on the
Great Fingall about the middle of last year
with authority to take charge, has resigned.
Stephenson soon came to the conclusion, as
a previous manager did, that the mine was
unpayable under existing conditions, namely,
double haulage from the deep levels and
long-distance trucking from the internal to
the main shaft at 1300 ft. He recommends
the sinking of a new T shaft in a more con-
venient spot.
Yuanmi (W.A.) had its annual roll-up in
London last month and took its solemn oath
that the outlook was better than it was a
year or even two years ago. Nevertheless,
admissions were made that the almost-
exhausted Oroya-Black Range could no
longer he relied upon for substantial profits
and that the oxidised ore in the Yuanmi
leases was fast giving out. Nearly all the
mill supplies were now sulphide, and as this
is harder to crush and treat than the oxi-
dised the capacity of the plant has greatly
decreased. Hope was expressed that further
development on the sth level and the open-
J ng of the 6tli level would warrant addi-
ticns to the mill, and so reduce costs and
increase profits. Reserves at the close
ot the year represented about 12 months’
’ tvt _ part of the ore exposed
ac the No. 5 level, and nothing below that
point was taken into account. The pro-
spects of the co.’s Warriedar options were
not boosted. As far as opened up the ore
averages about 50s. per ton ; but there have
been some disappointments, and the report
o, the Government Geologist is not very
encouraging.

As the general manager said all that could
bo said about the mine a couple of months
ago, the Kalgurli report deals only with the
financial side of the co.’s affairs for the year
ended September 30 last. 125,900 tons were
treated for £249,878, and the profit was
£98,084. Divs. at 16s. were the same as
the previous year, but costs at 20s. 2d. were
up 3d. The chairman, Charlie Stafford, an
ex-Maorilander and Kalgoorlieite, growled
at the meeting about the burdensome State
and Federal taxes, and reminded share-
holders that unless. good developments
occurred in unexpected quarters the profit-
able life of the mine could not be prolonged
much beyond the 12 months given it by the
manager.
* * * *
y ear Ida H. (W.A.) produced
£57,636, or £4077 more than in the previous
term ; and after writing £3557 off machinery,
£3215 off shaft-sinking and £7430 off devel-
opment, it wound up with a credit of £4701.
A 3d. div. free of income tax has just been
paid. An incline shaft connecting the 500 ft.
level and the deep workings below the sur-
face was recently completed at a cost of
£ll,OOO, and as a result of this work and
the removal of the mill to a more suitable
site costs are expected to come down 15s.
As regards the mine, developments have not
been as good as officially expected. The
shoot has proved poorer, and according to
what the chairman told shareholders at the
annual meeting the directors had on several
occasions been on the point of telling the
manager to close down, when something rich
came along and induced them to hang on.
There are 9000 tons of payable ore in sight,
and the man in charge is very hopeful re-
garding the future. The co.’s other interests
include a large holding in a doubtful
Nigerian tin venture, which, being a long
way off, is of course stated to have “great
possibilities.” a*
* * * *
According: to a managerial admission the
Mararoa (W.A.) is not finding the recently-
acquired Hardy Norseman leases as valu-
able as expected. Values were fairly satis-
factory in the old prospecting workings at
No. 2 level and for some distance below.
Then a bar of porphyry intruded and
knocked them out. The shaft is now being
deepened to test the shoot, and some dia-
mond drilling is being done. A series of
boreholes is also about to be put down from
the surface at the north end of the Mararoa
lease, where the ground is worth proving.
* * * *
Critics of J. S. Hartrick over the Em-
press (W.A.) ought to know how hard it is
to pick doubles. Because he selected Edna
May folk romped after him to Mt. Magnet.
Twelve months’ hard mining there makes
the claim look like a squib. Hartrick re-
signed in October. A. Penberthy took charge
on November 1. After looking round for a
month Penberthy put cold pie before the
directors. During his examination he found
two big winzes at 250 ft., one 15ft. long, the
other over 20ft. long, with the gold petering
out at about 50ft. deep. A block 78ft. long
was left in between, where values ranged
from extra special to nothing. As prospects
overhead didn’t please, Penberthy told the
Board that all it could do was to slap the
shaft down to see if gold made underfoot,
and pray it would. Hartrick’s pre-departure
report was silvern beside these words of
gloom. He had got 1494|0z. from 832 tons,
and as 706 tons came from his under-level
work he clung to the belief that gold would
make below the winze bottoms. The Board
must have had the blues badly over Pen-
berthy’s advice, so Hartrick in December
gave them a second report. Estimating 1000
tons overhead at 250 ft., and 2000 tons of
“highly payable” stuff below that level, he
repeated his advice to sink and to drive for
the Lady Brassey shoot, although Pen-
berthy didn’t give more than a hope in that
quarter. Giving in these reserves and
accepting F. C. Tricks’s statement that at
335 ft. the south drive has 30 inches of stone
worth from 15dwt. to 20dwt., the flotation re-
port is still far from confirmed. It may be un-
kind to quote, but here are the golden words:
“In placing this property before you I feel
quite confident it is an excellent proposition
which with proper equipment and judicious
management should return good dividends
to those who undertake to carry out the de-
velopment of the mine.”
* * * *
Old Bendigo families show up strongly
on the Carlisle board, with representatives
of the Lansells, Muellers, Dyasons and
Atkinsons. The co. was one of the best
dividend payers for 1915. The milling
ranged about the 6dwt. mark, but cash
results show that a close eye was kept on
outgoings. Thus a six months’ run cost
£BO4O for 12,224 loads treated, or an aver-
age of a trifle over 13s. per ton. Other
charges may raise the exes, to nearly 4dwt.,
but even then there is a bit of profit. At
1200 ft. John Jewell, manager, is stoping
40ft. of spurs at 150 ft. south. He says
prospects there are bright, and his rise to the
If 40ft. level is all in payable dirt. At the
1200 ft. intermediate he has abundant crush-
ing material, and “it will pay to take out,”
while at 1264 ft. he has a lot of crushing
material west of the level showing gold after
every firing. So. even Dyason confesses that
the working policy adopted will, “with the
hearty co-operation of the miners,” give a
prospect of shareholders getting “some”
return for capital invested.
* * * *
Finance has been the drag in Adelong
Creek affairs. It started in Melbourne on
paper, built a small plant and followed up
with litigation over the ownership of the
ground below Kershaw and Davis’s big
claim. This won, it joined the Baillieus in
promoting the Adelong Estates, getting a
wad of paid-ups in return. The co.’s own
little plant on its own big lease has yielded
profits every half-year save during the
droughty term. Thus some cash was nibbled
in for a second plant. Costs now for two
dredges fun to about 650 z. per week. Since
rain fell the tw r o plants have averaged
llOoz. weekly, so a nice profit has been
netted. But old sins carry their penalty,
and with £12,000 of debentures coming due
in December there must have been a lot of
heart flutters. However, a lucky market
mopped up a block of Estates scrip, some of
the bondholders wisely renewed, and so the
bar was crossed. The last five half-yearly
runs have been as follows: —
No. 1 Dredge. No. 2 Dredge.
,
Drift Gold Value Drift Gold Value
cub. yd. oz. cub. yd. cub. yd. oz. cub. yd.

Nov., 1915 . 253,663 1074 4.17 d. 280,139 1740 6.04 d.
The working profit for the last term was a
record, and now that finance won’t cause
loss of sleep, dreams of a div. are exceed-
ingly rosy. In other times the co. would
certainly be recommended to ease itself by
floating reserve shares, thus getting the cash
for a big dredge to rip into the wash. Bulk
handling is the game.
vr * * w
Leisner’s wolfram mine (N.Q.) gathered
in nearly £l4OO from its recent crushing;
and as it is still looking well, the Board
intends to improve the equipment and even
talks of erecting a mill. This will require
an increase of capital; for although a return
worth nearly £l4OO from less than 100 tons
of crude ore looks very sweet, the quantity
raised and treated has throughout been
small. Machine drills are to be introduced.
* * * *
Last year Charters Towers handed out
£27,907 in dividends, while calls only asked
foi £11,725. Nominally the returns show
improvement, because the dividends exceeded
calls by £16,182, whereas calls exceeded divi-
dends by £16,894 in 1914. Such a change of
form is, however, deceptive, because the field,
although it produced £251,492 last year, gave
£30.130 less than in 1914. Dividends in-
creased because money was distributed that
had been accumulated under more prosperous
conditions, and although call money was
badly needed, it was limited to £11,725, com-
pared with £22.733 in 1914. The State Gov-
ernment came to the aid of stragglers with
subsidies to aid prospecting and development.
The Brilliant Extended paid £12,500 last
year, but for the last two months it made
a loss of £lOO4, and for the greater part of
the year its workings at 3000 ft. and other
levels were unprofitable. But this big quar-
ter-million concern has another chance, for
it owns a lease some distance north of the
Bonnie Dundee, and will therefore watch
developments in the Bonnie and the recently-
floated Bonnie Dundee North with interest.

Last year Gympie crushed 116,951 tons
for 51,0340 z. gold. The average was about
9dwt. per ton, but the one big mine, the
Scottish Gympie, crushes nearly 90,000 tons
a year for an average of slightly over sdwt.

Since the Commonwealth Government
went into the oil-hunting business in Papua
Canadian drillers have had the field to them-
selves. The customary bald-headed reason
was given—“there was nobody in the Com-
monwealth capable of doing the work.”
Equally of course the Canuck said “Hear,
hear,” and cheerfully pocketed his (in some
cases) £5O a month. Lately, however, Min-
ister for External Affairs Mahon had a
bright moment, and remarked that if “there
was nobody,” etc., then it was time some-
body was taught. So Dr. Wade, who has
just returned to Papua to manage things
for the Government, is to be given a few
Australian University students and have
them instructed in oil-drilling. It is pro-
posed to pay them about £250 per annum
during their training.
* * * *
Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.) lately let
a contract to sink Taylor’s shaft another
lift. The next level will be at 2910 ft., so
the shaft will go nearly to 3000 ft. This is
the best evidence that the Board is satisfied
with prospects in the deepest levels of the
wonderful old mine.
11. E. Evenden, an old Tasmanian West-
Coast prospector, has discovered near the
Weld River a nickel and cobalt formation
which is claimed to be something extra-
special. He has also found in that little-
prospected region a big scheelite body which
assays well. A good deal of development
needs to be done, but those interested are
already convinced that they are on the track
of something big.
The Canterbury Petroleum Prospecting
Co., which has an almost inexhaustible well
of optimism and a boring plant, is still chas-
ing oil near Chertsey (M.L.). During the
year the drill has got down 680 ft. deeper,
and is now at 1290 ft. Old Arthur Joyce,
who is the main works of the show, says he
expects to get his first oil at 1500 ft., but is
quite willing, if the co. will stand it, to bore
on to 4000 ft. The co. has concessions over
250,000 acres in the district; so, as the
chairman remarked at the latest annual
meeting, if they “get a smell of oil things
will hum.” Yet even if they did get a smell
of oil it wouldn’t be proof that the whole
250,000 acres were good. That indeed is
the trouble in Maoriland. The beds are so
broken that the chances of extensive oil
areas are very small indeed.
* * * *
Stockman: Nothing of the sort. Wages
have nothing to do with it. At the bottom
the Broken Hill strike is simply a quarrel
for supremacy between the I.W.W. crowd
and the Laborites.... Old Sub.: Bedford has
no more to do with the Wild Cat column
than Bruce Smith, and never has had....
Tallarook: Don’t touch it. Suppose they
do pay the bulk of the money into Govern-
ment Treasuries, that won’t improve the
security of the shareholders. It is there
for the policy-holders’ benefit.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.* * [1

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 31, 1916.
My Dear Arini.—
Governor Strickland came down from Moss
Vale to preside over the ghost of old regattas.
And even the ghost wouldn’t have walked if
his Ex. hadn’t turned host and fed a handful
of speechmakers on his launch.
Races at Randwick on the same “26th”
were mostly patronised by a holiday crowd
who chased the odds in anything convenient.
Glac6 silk and white embroidered frocks —so
short that they looked as though they’d
shrunk in the wash —and the invaluable coat
and skirt were most on view. One of the
Philip Morton girls, in a dark-tailored suit
built up to her ears, had the usual leggy look
at the other end. Mrs. Ivenna, in a summery
gown of creamy lace, wore, besides, an airy-
fairy bit of millinery with a tall posy in
front. The Bucklands, of Pine Ridge, are
in town, and were in the usual eyrie where
they could meet anything that’s left of
Society in January. But races on January
26 are like oysters in May, and chiefly inter-
est the bookies and the casual crowd that
steadily backs everything but the winner.
The Mining Corps marched up George-
street and turned into the Town Hall for
their farewell show on Saturday night. The
bond —keeping its hat on its head —played
the Allies’ Anthems before it removed its
headgear and wiped its perspiring pate. In
the body of the hall hatted khaki groups were
sprinkled in the otherwise bare-headed
throng. The quaint part of it is that young
officers are frequent offenders in sticking to
their millinery indoors. Prof. David, now a
Major, cautiously labelled his address
“Whither?” No censor will quarrel with that
address.
Chaplain Wilson, who goes with the corps,
was in Frabce in the early days of the war.
“I asked a British Tommy what it was like
in the trenches,” he said. “It’s Hell,” was
the reply. “And how are you getting on ?”
"Tip-top,” said Tommy cheerily. From which
it looks as if theology will have to find a new
name for its old sulphur resort down below.
Consuls Chayet and Shimiza sat through the
long programme. Harpist Torzillo, who has
enlisted with the Miners, got an ovation
from his comrades when he tuned up his
sweet-voiced instrument.
Colonel Burnage, the Newcastle man who
went to the Front, has been convalescing
in England. His recovery is now assured.
In November he was wed to Helen Hasle-
wood, one of the six daughters of an English
parson. The knot was tied in Chelsea,
where once the sage Carlyle did walk and
talk to his Jane.
The quiet wedding of Miss N. M. Towns
to Archie J. Christie the other week interests
old Cornstalks who still talk of Bobbie
Towns. The bride’s father, Ned. is a son
of Sydney’s early shipping identity. Born
in the North of England in 1794, Towns
was bitten by the germ that makes sailors.
On a collier running between Shields and
London he got his first dash of saltwater.
Working up. he became a mate at 16. Later
he got a skipper’s certificate, and was in
charge of a coaster. After many seafaring
adventures the enterprising Bobbie came to
Australia. Eventually settling here he
married a sister of William Charles Went-
worth, founded a shipping firm, gave his
name to North Queensland’s most flourishing
town, and built up a fortune —which has
mostly gone into the melting-pot since the
old man died at liis residence, Cran-
brook, Rose Bay. Now his granddaughter
is wed to the man who superintends our
tangled mails in the G.P.O.
Julia Seton, M.D., of U.S.A., came here
last week. She’s a capable-looking woman
with smart business methods, and if you met
her in a ’Murfean magazine you would say
she was the successful proprietor of a big
department store or owner of a rag factory.
As a fact. Dr. Julia, who dealt in drills
before she took up Faith-healing, is the
prophetess-in-chief of “New Thought.”
Addressing a packed audience in the Odd-
follows. Ilall, the lady, aesthetically gowned
in flowing ivory drapery, admitted that some
of the thought was as old as the centuries.
Frankly, she is after the dollars herself, and
advises others to put their will-power to the
same use.
Of course, this is the crude oil of the
Seton lecture. There are other things—
new words set to old Sankey and Moody
tunes, and Moments of Silence, when the
audience “searches its soul for Peace.” At
the piano a young woman accompanied the
soul-searchers with appropriate music when
the time came to sing. Also, a soloist sang
“The Lord is My Light” in such silvery
notes that the congregation broke out in
loud applause. Goaded into action by the
husiness-like lecturer (who kept up a dulcet
purr of encouragement to give liberally in
order that you might receive in return) the
collection-bag chinked in fat content. “New
Thought” and Faith-Healing seem to be a
fine business proposition. Instead of hand-
ing over your money to ravenous wholesale
drug merchants, who have put prices up 500
per cent, since the war started, you can in-
vest it instead in such a French dream of a
gown as the lady wore on the day of her
reception in Sydney. But only one woman
here and there could wear it with equal
effect.
Died in Sydney a few days ago the widow
of that Charles Henry Edward Chauvel
who was owner of a vast cattle station,
Tabulam, on the Upper Clarence River, and
of Canning Downs, in Queensland. She was
mother of Brigadier-General Chauvel (on
active service), Lilian Chauvel, who
recently married a cousin and is well
known as a member of the Society of
Artists, and of two other daughters and
three more sons. Although she had seen
73 New Years, Mrs. Chauvel took an interest
in War Chests, Red Crosses, socks and sol-
diers that astonished the ordinary young
person. She was a Miss James before her
marriage, and a daughter of a one-time
secretary or treasurer or something to
Bishop Broughton. Colonel (as her husband
afterwards became) Chauvel was the first
captain of the old Clarence River Light
Horse Regiment, which sent a few of its
men to the Soudan, thirty years ago.
Jago Smith, M.L.C.. has just had a “golden
wedding.” He married the eldest daughter
of old Dr. Machattie, of Bathurst, a popu-
lar M.D. over whose remains the patients
he had kept alive raised a fine monument.
Jago is son of John, ex-M.L.C., who rose in
rebellion against his own plebeian label, and
named his brood Fergus, Lancelot Noel,
Edwin Ambrose, Claudius, and Wallace
Arabin. The daughters didn’t matter, so it
was merely Emily Jane who married the late
Justice Innes.
Our Best People fled from the surf beaches
to see the marrying of the once confirmed
bachelor Arthur Bowman and Lilian
Rhodes. The groom belongs to the Mac-
Kenzie and Bowman legal firm, and comes
from a family rich in flocks and herds. The
dainty girl-bride comes from no farther
than Braeside. Woollahra. Dorothy Gor-
don, a lively young daughter of the
popular Arthur Gordon, having taken
to society dressmaking. designed the
bridal finery. It was quite short, in
the fashion of the moment, and shrouded
by a billowy tulle veil which made a snow-
drift on the floor. Faint pink bloomed as
the. understudy of the upper terraces of
white crepe. True lovers’ knots strayed
over the confection, and a Dutch cap of lace
was the climax for the girl’s graceful head.
Bridesmaidens were in blush pink covered
with clouds of blue tulle. The cake was cut
in the T. and G. Flats.
Scotchbyterian parson John Ferguson had
a busy time on Saturday. Before assisting
at the Bowman-Rhodes wedding he tied the
knot in the same kirk for Stanley Coward
and Gladys Fuller. The latter wedding was
the big show event of the season so far. for
the war has tamed down the ordinary
orange-blossoming to an affair of khaki and
the parental blessing.
Gladys, tall and willow-wand, is daughter
of George Fuller. M.L.A.. who had about
200 guests to offer tribute and watch the
cake cut at the Australia. When father
was in the full tide of political glory—he
was a Federal Minister once—he took his
handsome wife to England to see the sights.
S7/c was. of course, eager to bob a knee at
Court, and there were no impediments. The
gorgeous gown of pink satin worn by mother
on that occasion was adapted for the
daughter’s wedding. A huge tail, of the
kind that waggles across the Palace floor
when the Presented lady makes her curtsey,
was an imposing terminus to the bridal
plumage. It was an ordinary tail, but
flashed with sequins and other dressy gew-
gaws. A Dutch cap tbrides are rushing
this pretty headgear), yards and yards of
tulle veil, and The usual orange blossoms
topped the outfit.
The five bridesmaidens were all smiles,
rosebuds and pink gowns. A hint that dia-
mond rings would he acceptable bore a har-
vest of the right presents from the groom.
Nancy Isaacs (daughter of the Justice),
Coralie Jones, Gwen Fuller, Florence Christ-
mas and Marjorie Cameron were the attend-
ant buds. The groom, who is nicely forti-
fied with fat sheep, is a son of the late H.
B. Coward, of various squattages. His
gift to the bride was a glittering expanse of
diamond pendant. By way of reminding the
company of the source of all these good
things, the four-tiered wedding-cake was
dotted with sugary sheep, etc. The pre-
sents from the company were up to highest
expectations. Money didn’t talk at this
gorgeous display—it shouted.
Two ladies, sisters, who surely must have
been the oldest school-marms iu N. S. Wales,
died within a few days of one another lately.
Mrs. Elizabeth Brooker had her funeral at
Gosford, and she was 94; Mrs. Jane Harri-
gan had hers at Tarraweena, near Wollon-
gong, and she was two years older. They
arrived in Australia with their mother in
’49, and straightway set out to teach the
youth of Wollongong that William the Con-
queror invaded England 1066.
And while I’m writing of early school
marms I remember that Sydney mammas
once sent their daughters to Miss Hannah
Love, of Harmony House, Kissing Point-
road, Concord.
One of the determined recruits in this town
was young Rich, a nephew of the Judge.
Rejected here for knee-trouble, the result of
an old football accident, he packed up for
England. Now he’s in the Flying Corps.
A Maoriland girl, Mary Elizabeth Sibbald,
was married in Petrograd towards the stormy
close of 1915. The affair took place in the
private chapel of St.. Vladimir’s Cathedral.
There a small but glittering Russian assem-
bly blazed with orders, the Grand Duke
Constantine (cousin of the Czar) being
amongst the guests. The ’groom. George
Hias Belitzky, has been recently invalided
from the fighting line. He seryed in the
Russian Imperial Guard. Mary Elizabeth
is a daughter of the William Sibbalds who
used to belong to Auckland.
Miss Jane Maddrell. a Braidwood iden-
tity, died after a long illness the other week.
For months the old lady had “takeij the air”
(as they said in the days of high gigs)
propped up with pillows in her motor. An
invalid, with the prevailing feminine desire
to see the shops, her chaise used to often
pull up outside the local stores. Miss
Maddrell was a daughter of the late Robert
of that ilk. He married in the long ago a
local heiress, Miss Coghill. This set the
golden ball a-rolling towards the Maddrell
feet. Coghill, senior, was an early settler
who got a generous slice of the Braidwood
district. He had the luck to be on the spot
at the right time. But though the Pioneers’
Club might let in old Coghill, if he were
alive, the Peter at its gate won’t let a
Maddrell slip through. However, as old
Bob, Miss Jane’s father, put barn to barn
till he was worth about a quarter of a mil-
ion, the family can easily get in by the early
door at almost any other Sydney club. Still,
Braidwood believes that the Pioneers’ edict
is a fly in the Maddrell ointment, and that
some day one of the family will do some-
thing desperate to the club gatekeeper.
L. Godfrey Smith has left the safety of
the Censor’s office in London, and joined
the 28th Battalion of the London Regiment.
That’s the lot that is known as “The Artists’
Rifles.”
ilrs. Carty Salmon, eldest daughter of ex-
Mayor Mat Harris, had a recent hurried trip
this way to see father. She is still the same
blooming young matron, and brought her
youngsters to romp with grandpa in the
holidays. An elder doctor brother is now
at Weymouth Hospital (Eng.), and a
younger Harris goes into training for the
Front in the cold grey isle.
Sylvia Darley, the flaxen-haired daughter
of the late Chief Justice (she who married
Baronet Anstruther), is again a widow. Her
second choice, Major Algernon Hanbury
Tracy, died lately of heart trouble. Both
husbands had Family Herald names. The
first, Wyndham Carmichael Anstruther, was
hereditary Grand Carver to the King or
something of the kind. But I fancy the poul-
try is first disjointed in the palace pantry.
Anstruther was out here on a health trip
when the Darley family whisked him off to
Lilianfels on the Mountains.
Mrs. Phillips Fox, in mourning for her
beloved artist, has been here on a visit. She
hasn’t dried her tears sufficiently to be
definite about her future. The artistic duet
kept on their flat in Paris, meaning to go
back when the enemy was fleeing home to
Berlin. Now Mrs. Fox contemplates a
sorrowful trip to France in April to take
over the household gods.
Artist Laurie Tayler, who sends some of
his pencil and brush work this way some-
times, writes from Chelsea Arts Club —not
a brisk place these times. “Lambert and
Dyson are here to-night, but most have en-
listed. Full wood. Streeton, Roberts, Coates
are doing R.A.M.C. work in the 3rd Lon-
don General Hospital—patients almost all
Anzacs. Chas. Wheeler left with the 22nd
Fusiliers for the Front last week. He is a
corporal and came out crack shot of the
battalion. We all wish him good things, as
he made a big sacrifice to go, his career as a
portrait painter being assured.” Tayler,
who himself is barred through heart trouble,
remarks that war isn’t much of a game to
be in. “But it’s just beastly to be out of it,”
he adds.
An attractive Lindfield damsel. Violet
Fisher, stepped out to the Wedding March
on January 29. Sydney Pritchard shared her
pilgrimage. Fisher pere, an old ex-civil
servant, has one of the most picturesque
chalets in the leafy suburb. And what is
more, at 70, is still his own chief gardener.
So son-in-law has built a nest in the
same district, and hopes to rival Dad with
a lawnmower.
Ashmead Bartlett comes by the Niagara,
having transferred from the Sonoma. This
makes him a day or two later. He steps off
the Canadian liner on February 11. and will
be hand-fed by the Journalists’ Institute
soon after.
Dudley Hamilton (really Farrell), who a
season or two ago upset all Sydney in its
endeavors to follow her tango steps, is due
to acquire the surname of Corbett, about
now, in Calcutta. The husband-elect was
captured during a tango campaign on India’s
coral strand.
“Willie” Dupain, well known to travellers
on the B.P. boats, took a bride the other
day—Muriel, daughter of Captain Morresby,
“old man” of the Niagara, which ploughs
along the All-Red route. The new address
of the Dupains is Rabaul, where “Willie”
will look after the B.P. interests.
The music-loving Dr. Hankins, whose
brass plate used to hang here, has taken root
in Bournemouth (Eng.), which has a repu-
tation for pine woods and fashionable in-
valids. After Hankins became a widower
he went back to England and married the
sweetheart of his student days. He had
thoughts of returning to Australia, but the
lady settled all that nonsense.
Mrs. Hugh Mclntosh is working up a
benefit for a widow with the usual quiverful
of youngsters. They don’t come under the
mantle of any of the numerous funds. Hence
the affair in the Tivoli on Feb. 18.
The Canadian nurses, fresh from the
snows of their long winter, suffered severely
at the Dardanelles. Some died at the Mud-
ros hospital, and the army surgeons had to
take over the nursing. Malaria and typhoid
have been the chief enemies. Surgeon-Lieut.
Wall, of this town, stationed at Mudros,
was amongst the doctors who did the other
sex’s job in the crisis. As a fact, Australian
Nightingales stand changes of climate better
than either British or Canadian women. So
far as the annals of the war go, the Aus-
tralian, .Tack or Jill, is about the toughest
subject either Bill or Bacteria can attack.
.Tust when we want all the doctors we
have, N. S. Wales back-country had the bad
luck last w r eek to lose one of its most modest
and best. Dr. Gibbs, a member of a
numerous Victorian medical tribe, was
driven up to Riverina by asthma a few years
ago. and squatted among the wheat stacks
of Ariah Park. Appendicitis the other day
sent him down to Jenner Hospital, in
Macleay-street, but no effort could save his
useful life.
Consul Chayet’s son is a gunner in the
wonderful French artillery, and was men-
tioned in despatches a while ago, though he’s
barely 20.
The Boy Scout with the willing legs has
been a useful little animal to Red Cross
dames. But he is a noisy nuisance when
he's let loose on the French’s Forest stump-
grubbers. On Anniversay Day about 150 of
the restless urchins swarmed over the motor-
lorries that now bump the workers to and
from the sandy settlement. Arrived on the
new selection, they fell like locusts on the
edibles of the axe-swingers. Politician Fitz-
patrick was chiefly responsible for this con-
tribution of boy. The hefty toilers who do
the work threaten to down tools if there’s
another mosquito raid.
On the subject of Australian fruits and
their carrying and keeping qualities in high
temperatures a man writes from the Far
North with the end of his prospector’s pick:
Don't you believe it, missus. The Australian
stuff s as good as the American. Every bit. Where
I live the thermometer lately crawled every day for
a fortnight to have a look at 114 deg., and once it
climbed to 121 deg. Some canned Australian fruit
stood this for a week, lying without shade on a
Xorth Queensland plain, after being churned for
three hours on a motor-lorry over 37 miles of bumpy
road. After it had been an hour in the waterbag
1 heard no growling about it not keeping. I have
eaten American tinned fruit in a good many parts of
this quarrelsome old world, and the Australian suits
me just as well as the imported.
Manly had its usual pretence of a carnival
last week, and the local shopkeepers made
much money while the local hospital gathered
a few pounds. The fiction of helping the
hospital is, however, so thin that there is
daylight showing through it in places.
Lieut. ,T. W. Baxter. A.F.A., has put an
engagement ring on the finger of Margaret
Ferguson. The Drummoyne girl is a
daughter of the Alex. Fergusons, of The
Grange.
The Tanned Sheepskin committee sends
word that it is still in the same old place,
Equitable Building. Every girl can keep
the blizzards off her hero for 7s. Sounds a
lot for the money, doesn’t it?
Tours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Melbourne, January 31, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Lady Helen has set to work, solidly and
systematically, to lunch or dine her chief
fashionable Red CrosserS. The Edward
Millers, the Button Day Joneses, the huge
tribe of Fairbairns, and lots of others have
been invited in twos and fours and care-
fully fed with beautiful food. The girls
who were called to the dinner-table melted
solid cheques on lingerie frocks and saw to
it that their performances were duly notified
in the daily vice-regal news.
Pa’s prediction that the war would be all
over last August having been well and truly
squelched, Guy Madden is really off
towards the Front in a beautifully-
fitting khaki tunic and wide panta-
loons, which give him the festive look
of a ballet dancer attired for business.
He carries a cane mounted with a long curl
of horsehair. I can’t find out whether it is
a sign of superior rank or merely a fly-swish.
The Innes-Noads —nieces of Bruce Smith
—are spending some of the money left them
by a lately-dead Smith uncle in the south
of England.' The girls take turns at driving
a huge yellow Rolls-Royce car, and the
latest news is that one of them drove it
clean through the fence of a duke’s park,
to the detriment of the fence, the car and
the fair driver’s nose. Niece Joan, who is
large and blonde, was recently married to a
soldier with such pomp that the affair was
filmed. Perhaps the fuss disarranged the
car’s steering nerves.
Bellura, the Mornington mansion where
Latrobe resided when he reigned over us,
happy and glorious, has been bought by
George Tallis, of the .T.C.W. firm, The fine
old place, with its 30-odd acres and private
reservoir, is well worth the £4500 paid for
it, so I don’t think anything extra could
have been charged for its vice-regal associa-
tions.
Mrs. Billy Williams was lately observed
returning to town with her touring car
heaped with luggage. She and her husband
(who may have been under the luggage)
took a humpy at Portsea for the summer
weeks, he to golf and rest his intellect, whilst
she prepared the food and washed her prog-
eny in the sea. One only gets help at Port-
sea sometimes, and even the Rich and Great
have to practise the pot trick. The touring
car has yet to be invented that will do the
washing-up and make the beds. Mrs. Billy
entertained several visitors between Mary-
anntics, one of them being Mrs. Norman
Falkiner. The Leslie Stuarts are a few
miles away at Portsea. and kill time plea-
santly with fishing parties and men’s corrob-
orees. Young Mrs. Simon Fraser, who spent
her flapper summers as Billie Clegg in
grandpa’s Portsea house, is now putting up
at the local hotel and dandling the new baby
on her knee.
Still talking of Portsea, I may add that
Mrs. Atlee Hunt grass-widowed there for
a while in a series of gorgeous toilettes that
attempted to outdo the moonlight decora-
tions put on by Providence. Her gowning
enraged the whole female population. Gen-
eral Stanley tramped the cliffs and sands
for a day or two and paid homage to the
clothes and the wearer. The only notice-
able males besides the General were a few
callow medical students sheltering in a
camp. Terrified husbands and fathers don’t
count socially.
Mrs. Hall (Bendigo Watson division) has
just crept out of hospital and commenced
a long convalescence. She had a trying
chloroform Christmas in the operating
theatre of Somerset House, and has just
gone back to her flat with a couple of
nurses in attendance.
Mary Chomley now has charge of the
honorary domestic staff - of a London hos-
pital for Australian officers, in the drowsy
days of peace she did so much secretarial
and organising work for high-toned charity
sprees that she was regarded as the per-
manently-appointed A.D.She to the Gover-
nor’s wife.
They are always learning things at the
Mayoress’s Patriotic League. Battlefield
experience has shown that unpleasant little
beasts fight shy of tussore silk, so shirts made
of that material are being rushed together.
The pale khaki stuff is cheap and plentiful,
and is either warm or cool according to the
weather.
Soldier-surgeon Guy Miller, killed in
France, belonged to an essentially practical
family; but, for all that, he had his leanings
towards other things. A decade ago he
used to play second fiddle in the University
Conservatorium orchestra, while the late
Franklin Peterson waved his baton over the
proceedings.
When the young man comes back from
. the Front, Colonel Cuscaden, P.M.0., is to
hand over his little Eileen to Lieutenant
Charlie Derham, of the A.1.F., by an
arrangement made under romantic circum-
stances of which only the immediate friends
of the parties—about 1000 —have been in-
formed. Charles is a son of that well-gilded
commercial mammoth, Frederick Derham,
who has shaped the fortunes of the Swallow
and Ariell firm for ages past.
Mrs. George Chirnside, who has been Red
Crossing at a furious rate, is to be the centre
of a purely local effort at Werribee, the
family stronghold, on February 19. It will
be her last patriotic fling before going to
join George and daughter Audrey “abroad.”
Dr. Svme has returned convalescent to
Melbourne. It is rumored that there is to
be a large Australian hospital to which
wounded will be sent direct, and that S.vme
will be in charge.
Enter Adelaide full of dry-bone facts and
figures:—
Passengers by the Karmala included Miss Cecily
Mclvail, who is to be married on her arrival in
London to Dr. Lucas, of Adelaide. -He is at present
engaged “somewhere” in France or Flanders.
Premier Vaughan is patting himself on the back
that the Government has secured town-planner
Reade’s services “on excellent t firms'' for four
months when he has finished his work in Tasmania.
There is a fairly big programme of work awaiting
him here, i.e., to “improve” the reserves at Morialta
and Waterfall Gully without civilising them out of
all their present charm; to do ditto for ’the lakes
at Mount Gambier; and probably to lay-out the
model suburb at Mitcham, as well as do various un-
specified minor jobs.
The David Wilkies are to move from here to
Maoriland. They depart some time in March.
Miss Nora Kyffin Thomas is putting in a fortnight
in Sydney—and is probably in training for another
series of winter charity entertainments.
Evergreen General Gordon passed through on Fri-
day, arriving by the Melbourne express and departing
by that day’s mailboat for England, and, inciden-
tally, Spain. The Commandant and a member of
Parliament met him and mentally noted that he
carries the 60 years with which the local press
debits him as lightly as if they were a pound of
sausages.
Another member of the Register staff has put
down his pen and taken up the bomb. The new
recruit is J. A. Tonkin.
Dorothea Proud, who for nearly three years has
been studying social economics in England under the
Catherine Helen Spence Scholarship, has been “com-
mandeered” by Lloyd George for munitions work.
Writing on December 1, she said: “This morning
I was summoned to Mr. Lloyd George’s house, and he
said he had commandeered me for a new sub-depart-
ment of the Munitions Department. I have to find
out what possibilities there are of getting ladies to
superintend the women and girl workers in munition
factories.” When she wrote about the “ladies” and
the “women” and the “girls,” Miss Proud’s thesis
was being typed prior to its submittal to the Univer-
sity of London for approval—that approval bringing
with it the D.Sc. degree. It is a lengthy affair of about
120,000 words entitled “Welfare Work—A Study of
Employers’ Experiments for Improving Conditions
within Their Own Factories.”
Professor Jethro Brown has accepted the offer to
step under Mr. Justice Buchannan’s wig as president
of the State Industrial Court. He will also be
president of the Prices Regulation Commission and
of the Rents Court, and will be appointed acting-
Judge of the Supreme Court as necessity arises—
also, most likely, Keeper of the Swans and Warden
of the King’s Nightmares.
Dr. Murphy, of Collins-street, is a gor-
geous spectacle these days. He wears a
uniform of greenery-yallery khaki enriched
with stripes, shoulder straps and buttons of
wonderful scarlet and gold. If he isn’t
something more than a field-marshal he ought
to be. The army doesn’t offer sufficient pro-
motion to come right up to his garmenture.
He’s the star-spangled bonzer, and should
have a national hymn written about him.
Dr. Janet Moray Lawrence, Tasmania’s
first lady doctor, was soon “fed up” on
Queenstown and the Wild Wet Coast. She
is off now to help at the Front.
Claude Vanderkelen, son of Belgian Con-
sul Vanderkelen, a tall, elegant young man
with the coal-black eyes and moustache of a
novelette hero, is to marry Claire Cuddy,
a Toorak girl, on February 4. The per-
formance will be at St. John’s.
Venora, daughter of the Jim Watsons of
Brighton, and a granddaughter of the Gilded
Watson of Bendigo, was married to her
large, beloved Percy Perkins just as soon as
he got into khaki. Yenora, the only daugh-
ter of wealthy parents, is aged 18, and Dad
shook his head at marriage talk until Percy
was ready to throw down his pen and march
away to war. The heavy father then gave
his consent under gentle pressure, added his
blessing, and arranged for girlie’s dress-allow-
ance to continue. Percy is now in an officers’
training-school, and spends his leave with
Yenora at the Perkins home. She has 20
pairs of shoes in her trousseau, but only
wears one pair at a time.
Dr. Bage’s blue-stocking family are on
the move. Daughter Alice is to marry
Bananalander Heaton Clarke at Christ
Church, South Yarra, on February 17, after
which Mrs. Bage and daughter Ethel will
start for Japan and Korea. The prepara-
tion of travelling duds and the trousseau
splendors are making the home a whirlwind
o f rags. The travellers will spend a brief
holiday in Brisbane with clever I reda, who
is scientifically chasing the prickly-pear curse
on behalf of the State Government. Some
time ago she came out with a learned attack
on Bitter Pip, or something, in apples. It
pineapples ever suffer from the dumps s ie
will doubtless publish a treatise on that.
Walter Berry, the merchant who married
a millionairess American widow, is off ° n
active service. Since war started ne Jias
been giving instruction in artillery work
locally. Now he is going where the powder
is actually burning, and his fighting costume
is a dream of military tailoring.
Bernard Barton (his father mastered the
Royal Mint of yore) has got a fat billet in
Korea, and Mrs. Bernie and. the little ones
have gone to abide with him. They find
Korea a bit quiet thus far.
Web Gilbert’s 'bust of George, of St.
George’s, Hanover Square, has been handed
over to the retiring Pie Commissioner, and
the marble-chipper is getting ready to sculp
the new Pieman, Andrew lusher.*
When the panto, had finished last Wednes-
day afternoon, Her Majesty’s rang up the
curtain again at five o’clock on a special
children’s version of the insanity. The vice-
regal people came along after afternoon-tea
with the children, and the stalls were packed
with an invitation party. Lady Doris Black-
wood, in a white dress and a cartwheel,
purple-straw hat, shared the care of some
nephews with a new aide who showed a
bald, youthful, fair head to the people
behind. They showed no emotion —would
you believe it?
The scenery for the little show was Noah’s
Arkian —wooden cows, horses, soldiers and
old’ women in the foreground, and Noah’s
Ark houses and Paris-green trees stuck like
almonds in the rounded hills. The kiddie
performers carefully and cleverly imitated
the “Mother Goose” principals. Audrey
Anderson, as Gretchen, was received with
familiar shrieks of welcome. She is the
special child dancer who demonstrates steps
to the more illustrious kids in the Jennie
Brenan classes.
A vision ih pale pink, with the greenest
green shoes and stockings, attracted a heap
of mixed attention in Collins-street the other
afternoon. On closer examination it proved
to be Maud Fane, principal girl in “Mother
Goose.” The color scheme was startling,
and a guarded reference to it addressed
to the lady called forth a squeak of sur-
prise, followed by a gurgle of merriment.
The wearing of the green, it transpired, was
quite unintentional. Maud had just got
through a matinee, and until spoken to was
blissfully unconscious that she was parading
some of her principal-girl trade marks in the
light of day. Anyhow, that’s the story.
Fashion’s fatted queens are in a state of
absolute terror at the threatened revival of
the hour-glass waist. The wide and erino-
liney skirts are forcing the hands of dress-
designers who begin to see that there must be
a “line” somewdiere. The suburbs are full of
delighted bone-racks, who are able to take a
long, long pull on their corset laces without
fainting away.
A well-known Collins-street medico com-
plains that a lot of rich women are classing
operations and rest-cures as luxuries which
are not to be indulged in just now. Feminine
hypochondria is “off” until further notice,
and the profession is missing it sadly.
Mrs. Arthur Tarpey, of California, who
has . been on a visit to her old home in Aus-
tralia for the last six months, returns to
America by the Sonoma. She has spent
the last few weeks rushing madly between
the shipping office, the U.S. Consulate and
other helpful spots in search of a passport.
Tarrants’ and various car-owners
arranged a great outing for wounded sol-
diers on Saturday. The Aspendale race-
course was engaged, and when a blue break
in the weather appeared, feeding marquees
mushroomed up from the ground. A whirr-
ing procession of some 300 cars snaked out
by St. Kilda-road and .the beach ways.
Colonel Tarrant’s car led, with a daughter’s
vivid hunter’s pink veil fluttering from her
bonnet. Mr. and Mrs. Durrance hurried
along, the lady enveloped in a smart sea-
blue gown with a huge khaki motor coat.
\V hen the sun came out she emerged in fine
frills. After lunch some specially selected
pretty typistes trotted round the’big circle
of guests bestowing smiles, cigarettes, cigars
and sweets. Meanwhile a fine military band
crashed out cheerful tunes from the grand-
stand. After a long afternoon of motor
sports, all hands mra tea and went along
to the moving-pictures at Mordialloc, where
they found the local townspeople giving a
party for local returned wounded. Mrs
Geoffrey Syme had lent the grounds of Sea-
tord for the entertainment, and engaged Di
Itiiio and his players to make music.
~ r f: Robert M alpole, of Malvern, who
died the other day at Phillip Island, had a
local, reputation as a doer of good deeds •
w , Wa i S ! er husband who made the name
of Malpole known.. He was for some vears
secretary to the Victorian Employers’ Fede-
ration— that over-zealous secretary who pub-
licly declared marriage a luxury, amid the
groans and howls of organised labor and
the ill-suppressed wrath of his own beloved
employers. Certain Walpole daughters
(there are five of them) have made fain I
musical and literary prints upon the sands
ot tune. One married Balcombe Bern
who has his name in Who’s Who among
the Sheep and owns a squattery in thf
Beaufort district; and another chose Dr
Stuart Cross for her own.

You have to be careful about these trade
names. 1 talked the other day of “German
jaeger-stuff,” and you knew what I meant
—any kind of stockingette, (Why will they
spell it without a gV). But it seems “jaeger”
isn’t a common English word yet, any more
than “tabloid.” There is a British co.
which owns the name, and there isn’t any
“German jaeger-stuff” in Australia; any-
way, there’s no German Jaeger here. Very
well, I’m sorry.
Amy Castles, supported by tenor-baritone
George and flautist Amadio, with Harold
Whittle at the piano, is singing to the native
Tasmanians these times.
The gossips here are working overtime on
the case of a man and two manicure girls.
The trouble is that the less experienced
scandalmongers (call them the outer-sub-
urban repeaters) confuse the frivolous man-
principal with his very serious brother.
Serious Brother is _ a person of some im-
portance, and his initials are very much
like those of the frivoller. Hence the awk-
ward misunderstanding in the minds of
half-informed gossipers.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

VISITOR: “Never been away from this vil-

“Corney: “Saw a fresh-water turtle or
tortoise which had apparently been out visiting and
was returning to the river. On the way he happened
on an antbed—one of the flat variety occupied
by beef ants. He walked over it without trouble,
but when he reached the end of the antbed, instead
of keeping the straight path that leadeth home, he
turned round and retraced his steps. The ants
objected to him making a promenade of their house-
tQp and attacked him. This made him put on the
pace a bit, yet each time he reached the edge
of the antbed he turned back again. His insanity
was eventually fatal to him, and he died. Wonder-
ing if others of his kind would do likewise I caught
a sample and put him on a similar antbed. He
acted in the same loony fashion, but feeling that
I was responsible for him I rescued him from the
fate of his deranged -predecessor. On different
occasions I tried the experiment, always with the
same result. What is the fascination which the
antbed has for the turtle ? Does he like the smell
of the ant, or does he like the scenery ?

“Mulga”: “Condamine” (B. 2/12/T5) is
very near the mark when he names the rosewood
and pomegranate of Queensland as the toughest
bush-dwellers to kill, but he missed the bull's-eye
by overlooking the white ti-tree that grows in the
brigalow and belah scrubs of the Darling Downs.
For years settlers in these parts have tried every
conceivable way to kill the plant, but in a few
months after being assaulted it flourishes a hundred-
fold. Perhaps some Abo.-scribe knows of something
fatal. Incidentally, • the rosewood mentioned by
“Condamine” is splendid stoking wood for the fire-
box.

“Marloo ’: The most expert weight-putter
I have met, considering its size, is the artt-lion, that
insect which provides for its menu by means of a
cone-shaped trap in the ground. If a pebble is
dropped into the trap the beast emerges from
beneath the dirt, puts the geological specimen on
its head, and by some means other than natural
gravitation or political economy heaves it in the
direction Casabianca took on a memorable occasion.
Murphy had a load of gravel tipped into his back-
yard a few days ago. 1 sat on a box to watch him
spread it. He carried a few shovelfuls of dirt
from the rear of the house where I had noticed
that numerous large ant-lions resided. Then he went
and leaned on the fence. I turned my head to tell him
how to take Constantinople, when a piece of gravel
hit me im the eye. Other pieces struck me in
various places before I reached cover. When I
looked back that gravel was flying in all directions.
If we could breed big enough ant-lions and put
them into the trenches with a plentiful supply of
bombs the war would be over in time for the foot-
ball season to get going.
“E.D." : They were sitting on the veran-
dah after the supper of a Backblocks dance. He was
smoking with an arni around her waist, and she was
wondering how to bring him to the scratch. She
mentioned how sister Polly' and Jack were getting
on so well; a saving girl was the making of a man ;
and Polly wasn’t the only one of their family who
could save. Bill thought it time to change the subject,
but ideas don’t come early in the bush. Presently
taking out the pipe he said: “I say, Annie.” “Yes,
Bill,” she whispered. “What’ll you bet I carn't spit
as fur as them railin’s?” That marriage was off.
‘‘Nick Bottom” : What is the largest size
attained by the bull-rout? One captured at Web-
ster’s Creek (N.S.tl.) the other day turned the scale
at 250 z. The Peter who captured it mistook it for
a cod, with the inevitable result. It is a well-
known fact that the pain occasioned by a prick
from a bull-rout’s spikes subsides at the turn of
the tide. On this occasion the tide didn't turn for
14 hours. At the end of that time a pint of rum
arrived instantly the tide reversed arms. There are
-several remedies for bull-rout “stings." but the
best I know is to scarify the flesh around the punc-
ture and pour liquid ammonia into it. There is also
a wild lily, the “cungy-bov,” whose root, crushed
and applied in the form of a poultice, is said to
take out the sting.
“F.H.R.”: I have often read stirring tales
of riding after horses, but the most exciting ride of
my life was from one. I was looking for a lost
heifer in a strangers’ paddock when I disturbed a
draught stallion and his harem. I didn’t know he
was such a whale for fight, and when he charged
me I thought a couple of well-directed chops with
my whip would be sufficient to cool his ardor. But
though the first one brought the skin and hair fly-
ing it only roused the devil in him, and my pony
losing heart took his head and off down the
mountain. I wasn’t a Billy Waite, but I managed
to duck under an ugly limb or two, and when we
entered the blackthorn scrub I rode Tod Sloan
fashion to avoid being pulled out of the saddle by
the clematis vines. A crashing in the rear such as
one would expect a furious elephant to make made
my hair throw my hat off. At last we emerged into
the old ploughed paddocks of the flat. Here the
pony got a bit of a lead on the thundering monarch,
but unfortunately for me a two-rail fence loomed
stiaight ahead. I had never ridden a horse over a fence
and I didn’t know if my nag could or would jump,
so I set niv teeth, grabbed the pommel of the saddle
and Well, I’ve never been on a railway engine
when the boiler burst, but I think the sensation
must be something like what I experienced. I have
a dim recollection of flying through space and then
of waking up and seeing a stallion looking derisively
ac . n l e ° vcr a low fence - I've never understood
why he didn t jump the fence and eat me.
TR TIE FRI END SHIP.
SENTIMENTAL INEBRIATE : “Ye'll (hie) never deshert me like er rest o' flamin' Ren's
will yer, Jacky?"
JACKY (fervently): “Mine stick you, Boss. You. got tickpence!"
“Leo Lear”: The proposal of Elmslie,
' ictorian M.L.A., to compel station-owners to spend
wages in proportion to the value of their holding
recalls employment on estates in early days. Most
of the runs had gangs of men falling over one
another doing nothing in between meals. Some of
the W estern Victorian squattages would compare
favorably with the Post Office of 1915. It was
mostly the absent owner’s fault. Some of them
couldn’t refuse a man a job, forwarded odd lots
lip,to the station, and kept the manager cursing for
weeks. On one occasion on the old Manthum run
the manager in despair sent the latest gang to the
slaughter' yards to stack bones and skulls in two
heaps. Having finished the job they returned and
asked what next. “Go back and wait for some
more,” bawled the boss. On Murndale I’ve seen
four men moving earth with one barrow; one filled,
one wheeled, one unloaded and the fourth was the
greaser. On an adjacent property the surplus loafers
were told shearing was to commence the next week
and their job was to “get to out of sight till
it was over. Don t know if the wages of these
bloques would come within Elmslie’s stipulated sum,
but I guess their keep amounted to a fair bit.
I’m told that the same thing happened at the big
Broken Hill mine. The directors were mostlv
squatters, and they unloaded so many derelicts on
to the concern that years later, when a little Dutch-
man took charge, he grabbed at the chance of a
labor dispute to shut the mine down and thus scrape
the barnacles off.
Romnej : This poisoning of sparrows
isn t as easy as Circular Quay settlers would have

birds is too unlike the Censor’s department, for one
thing Item: I was breeding stud fowls and feed-
ing them with a mixture of sharps and barlev meal
As the sparrows found this much to their liking I
distributed a daily-increasing quantitv of it over

upon a day, I poisoned the sparrows’ portion and

as no good and ruthlessly wasted is black bean,
one of the most valuable woods for cabinet and
indoor work. It is very easily split and always
runs true. I have seen a table made from a slab
4ft. wide and 2in. thick which had been split from
a bean log. If this timber grew in Japan or in
Germany we would tumble over ourselves in our
eagerness to import it ; but as it grows in our own
forests it is, like so much else that Australia pro-
duces, “no good.’’

SEVEN BAGS TO THE ACRE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W hen you’ve got a team and stripper,
And the crop is all your own,
You are something like a skipper
Sailing out on seas unknown ;
You may reach the port you sail for,
You may drift along to wreck,
But it’s certain you won’t fail for
Lack of confidence on deck ;
And no skipper sails an ocean,
Or commander steers a fleet,
With a pleasanter emotion
Than you navigate your wheat.
A on have labored at the clearing
Till your clothes are worn to rags,
But the compensation’s cheering
When “she’s running seven bags.”
Then it’s lowering or it’s lifting
As the stubble’s dwarfed or high ;
There’s a lot of stuff needs shifting,
And the hours rush scudding by,
While the demon fire is waiting
Like a hound upon the chain,
To go leaping, devastating
Through the ripe and eager grain;
Or a deadly calm’s connoting
A grain-dispersing gale ;
Or thunder-clouds are floating
With their freight of crushing hail.
But you’re very optimistic,
And the labor never drags,
And your steeering's quite artistic
When “she’s going seven bags.”
Oh ! how patiently you’ve waited
For a season such as this,
And how often you’ve been fated
What you coveted to miss.
Now you conjure, up a vision
Of a pretty girl in white,
Who said: “Yes,” with shy decision
• To your pleading, Sunday night.
And, Oh ! ’mid love and laughter
Yes, she kissed you back again!
The wedding will be after t
You have marketed the grain.
So the better days are coming,
And your courage never flags,
W hile the stripper's humming, humming,
To the tune of “seven bags.”
You have been alert and nimble,
But the game was never fair,
For chance would rig the thimble,
But at last the pea is there; -
And satisfied ambition
. Makes imagination fly—-
Cherished hopes come to fruition.
Happy days are very nigh.
And you see another vision
Of a cottage ’mid the pines,
And your fancy with precision
Traces out its precious lines,
While the stripper’s humming, humming—-
Oh! the heart is cold that lags
When the wedding day is coming
And the crop is seven bags.

MRS. SALTER.
“SAVING MOTHER!”
HEAN’S TONIC
NERVE NOTS
Mean New Energy
to Tired Housewives.
Now that the expense of living has gone up so
considerably, fehe worries and difficulties of house-
keeping have increased tenfold. There is far more
nervous strain and serious anxiety involved in
“making both ends meet’’ than there was a year
or so ago. In many hdmes where help was kept the
busy mother has now to do all her own work, and
cooking, cleaning, dressmaking and mending occupy
all her time, to the deprivation of outdoor exercise
and the detriment of health. One lady tells the
story of how she managed to get through the extra
work that fell to her in consequence of reduced
means
“In the beginning of the year.” says Mrs. Saiter, of Newtown, the firm by which
my husband is employed, owing to business losses, had to cut down salaries consid-
erably. I was, in consequence, compelled to dismiss my help, anti the entire work
for a family of five, including a baby of six months, came on me. I was in continual
fear of 3lr. Salter losing his position altogether, and this, with the necessity of
cutting down expenses all round, and doing without our usual yearly holiday, had a
very bad effect upon my health. I became a victim to insomnia, lrardly getting one
good night’s rest in ten, and you may imagine how that told on me with hard work
all day, no hope of a rest in the afternoon, all the sewing to be done, as well as the
meals to cook. I got so nervous that the children’s voices, as they played about me.
seemed to go through my head. I was anxious and irritable, everything seemed a
trouble, ami I was a misery to myself and everyone around me. One lucky night,
however, Mr. Salter, who had been greatly worried about me, brought home a bottle
of HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS. A friend in the office had told him how he had
been saved from an illness by their agency, and advised that I should try them.
“In about a week’s time I felt a perceptible difference, My sleep was as sound
as a child’s. My appetite, which had completely deserted me, rapidly improved.
Renewed strength was soon the result, and now my friends tell me that I look fifty
per cent, better tlian I have done for years. The way TONIC NERVE NUTS helped
me is wonderful. I cannot speak too highly of them as a remedy for those, who,
like myself, are obliged to work hard and constantly for others, and who need
strength and wish to avoid the harmful use of stimulants.”
HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS cost 3j- per bottle,
containing 10 Days’Treatment; or six bottles for 17jd

“Barcoo”: The bullock-whip of the good
old days, 18 feet from silk cracker to stringy-bark
handle-butt, with a crack that could be heard three
miles along the team tracks of the Bulloo and AVar-
rego, is no more. Bill Oxconductor now uses four
or five feet of trimmed leather tied to the end of
any old stick, because, instead of Bill having to. roar
to make his far-away leaders hear him, they, being
yoked four abreast, now respond to his “God bless
you 1” even when tlie benediction is delivered in his
best Oxford drawl. Yoked thus the team is closer
up to Its haulage and is handier to navigate.
» • * *
“Anob”: Surely this branding of horse-
flesh is being overdone. I came across the following
living signboard lately. Jt was in the shape of a
bay gelding and was advertising “6” on the near
cheek, “J7T” near shoulder, II tinder a half-circle
below near saddle, crossed parallels on near loin,
square over O under half-circle on near thigh. I
didn’t travel round to the off-side, and hadn't to
clip to see these, so may have missed some. The
vendor assured me these brands represented the
cream of N.S.AV. buyers and enhanced the crock’s
value. I cried off, explaining that my brand was
the warning to pub-keepers in Sura LXXXIII of the
Koran: “AA'oe to those who stint the measure,” and
there wasn’t enough spare hide for that.
* * * *
“Tiaki”: Re that par of “Try Fluke's”
(T?. 9/12/’l5). He is right and also wrong. Henare
of old didn’t pluck his fowls or skin his tuna (eels).
He cooked them with their foliage intact. He usu-
ally put the kereru (pigeon) in an envelope of clay.
The feathers came away with the clay and left the
flesh clean and white. Henare seems to have been the
inventor of the paper-bag cookery which was the rage
a few years ago, only he used mud instead of paper.
* * * *
“Tropicus”: We fire horribly hungry
and wet and cold when we got ashore on the Papuan
coast after losing the boat and gear through a capsize.
All that survived was the sensation of a void in
Little Mary, an oar, the boat’s rudder, a shotgun and
a hag full of brass shells loaded with No. 4 shot.
AVhv the armory was saved I dunno ; it was saved,
and was the means of our becoming on good terms
with the fat old Samoan engaged in distributing the
Word and cheap German “trade” goods amongst the
natives in return for copra and bPch-de-mer. AA'lien
we sauntered up to the mission-house the old chap
offered us all he had—flying - -fox stew and green
cocoanuts! AA’e ate as men will who are virtuously
hungry, and caring not what we filled up with so
long as it was food. For six weeks we camped with
his Reverence, and nearly every day would march
to where Mr. and Mrs. F. Fox and their large pro-
geny dwelt in thousands and blaze off a few cart-
ridges. That little walk, a swim in the 1 igoon inside
the reef, long hours of rest in the cool shade of
the palms learning the vernacular from flower-decked
THE OPTIMIST.
“Well, Bill, 'ow's the city lookin' this year?"
“Bonser! Larst year the girls were sharin' whips er leg. This year it's their chests
Bet yer life I'm not missin’ next Christmas!"
and coeoanut-oiled damsels, filled our days—these
and the consumption of fox. At first we had to
forget the musk-like smell of tlie obscene food, but
use gave strength, and we got callous enough to have
dined off dog. We soon exhausted the library, and
then fell back on oiled girl for platonic amusement,
and kept hard at work eating fox, fried, boiled,
baked and roasted in the stone ovens. But it took
us months of civilised diet, much physic and many
warm baths to g'ct rid of what clung to us. People
would listen a while and then say: “Oh, you are the
chaps who lived so long on fox?” They swore they
could hear the accent of bat every time we
breathed, but that was pure exaggeration. Still, 1
know here must have been something wrong.
“Little ’Ook": I let “Devilfish,” or any-
body who can go one better, have his own way about
the corset measurements of a tree-fern. I'm entering
in the height competition. Near Gadd's Hill
(Tas.) there is one that stands 160 ft. in its socks.
\ou may call me a liar, but there it is, the socks
referred to consisting of 140 ft. of dead eucalypt and
the fern itself sprouting from the dry forks. It
looks quite happy.
"MeNorth” : How's this for a narrow
squeak? It was up in the Tate River country
(X.Q.). Big Roberts and his mate had drilled the
holes in the floor of the 25ft. shaft. The mate had
gone to (he surface to prepare the dynamite charges.
W hen they were ready, lie sent them down in the
bucket to Roberts, who then sent up the tools and
charged the holes. Meanwhile the mate hauled up
the tools and removed the windlass barrel to save it
front the fix ing pieces of rock when the uprising took
place. Roberts watched all the fuses “spit,” and
started to climb. At hen he was about seven feet up a
lashing carried away, and the ladder crashed down
the shaft, hurling hint backwards on to the stone
floor. There he lay stunned on top of, and between,
the smoking fuses, while his mate, shaking like a
circus elephant, leaned helplessly over the mouth of
the shaft, lie couldn't lower the rope because the
windlass barrel was unshipped, and there was no one
to help him put it on again. Time was flying, and
all the while the fuses were getting shorter and
shorter. Then inspiration came. A bucket of water,
used for tempering drills, stood near by. Seizing
it he emptied it down the shaft. Roberts stirred,
groaned, and slowly sat up. He wiped the water
from his face, and looked round wonderingly. His
mate threw down a knife. “Cut the fuses! Cut
the fuses!” he roared. Roberts’s wits came back
with a rush. Quite coolly he cut the death-carriers,
beginning with the shortest. He was just in time-
one was on the point of disappearing through the
collar of the hole when it was amputated. Another
two seconds and the fire would have been beneath the
surface, and then nothing could have stopped a row.
Roberts and his mate knocked off for the rest of the
day. It was a crowded 60sec. for the mate.
AT HOME.
THE MESSENGER OF LOVE: “Good morning, Mrs. Branigan. Is your husband in?"
MRS. B.: “At, sir, 'e is indeed."
THE M.L. : “Then, can I see him for a moment?"
MRS. B. : “No 'ope, sir. 'E’s in fer six months."
“Merma”: As “Yerdad” explains (B.
30/12/’l5), life at 12,000 ft. in the rarefied air of
the Andes isn't too pleasant; neither is the joy of
getting there for some people. Arrived in Antofaga-
sta, care of us, a cigar-eating ’Murkan traveller on
his way to the Collahuasi copper-mine. Some of us
who knew didn’t think he would get there on
10 to 15 cigars a day, but over a couple of cock-
tails at the bar on the train (good, aren’t they,
erdad”!) he guessed mountain sickness wouldn’t
get him. He got nearly three-quarters of the way
up before his ears and nose began to bleed and bis
heart to misfire like a second-hand motor sold “with
all faults.” They hustled him down on a railway
har.d-car to a lower altitude, and saved him by ad-
ministering oxygen. lie made a fresh start after
three weeks' rc't in port, but the offer of a cigar
tinned him the color of the wares in a Chinese duck-
a nd-pork shop.

legs at the bottom, leaving one inch out of the wood.
Stand the legs in tins or jars, and instead of water
put a tablespoonful of kerosene into each receptacle.
Dust won’t accumulate on the surface, as the oil
saturates and sinks it. No ant of any decent family
will go near kerosene.

“Alamon” (from the X.T.) : Recently I
employed four niggers cutting trenches, and one of
them dug up a tree with twisted roots. He dropped
the shovel, yelled to his mates, and there was a
wild eorroboree round the hole. I got no more work
from those nigs for two days. They were too busy
making boomerangs out of the bent roots, and put
in more solid work at it in 48 hours than I could
get out of them in two weeks. The curious part
of the business was that, though knives were avail-
able, the scraping down was all done with broken
glass.
* *
“The Satyr”: He was the baldest man
the kids at the camp had ever seen. Said young
Billjini. aged 10, in an awed whisper: “He muster
been ringbarked.”

“City ( annibal" : What is “pipe na loan’’?
Col. Pethebridge, administrator at Rabaul, has issued
an order prohibiting natives from making or eating
■he preparation, which is derived from the roots of
certain bush plants. Pethebridge issued his prohibi-
tion, or, rather, renewed an old prohibition, “on
account of the effects pipe na loun induces of exciting
a propensity to unrest and violence.”
“Barcoo”: Noticed in Abo. column a
shearers' “babbling: brook" (cook) saying he was sick
and tired of the smell of the barbers. I think
the feeling is mutual, only more so on the shearers'
part. I also noticed that somewhere in N. S. Wales
tucker bills are the tough qnestion of the moment.
The alleges.! cooks that have to be put up with
would drive a bloke to destruction. It's the good
me nev that entices them to work the confidence trick.
I exonerate the few that can cook, but they are as
scarce as green grass in West Queensland at present.
A favorite trick of the babbler when things get a
move on is to tap the rep. for another bob a man
per week, or else “in goes the towel.” The shearers
have to knuckle under as. in the circumstances, no
other poisoner will “come up.’’ Our shed cut out
four days ago ; cost of living, 325. per man. “Extra
cost of commodities” was the gag. The shearers
have themselves to blame for such extortion. The
Arbitration Court handed the cooks 4s. per man per
week, and advanced the shearer from 20s. to 245.
per 100 sheep. The barber in his grandiloquent
manner put up his cook to as. to correspond with
his own advance. The latter seeing he had J. Bill
“on the run” lifter! the price another shilling. In
s-une circumstances he puts in for 75., but that is
when he has us fixed properly.
* » * *
“Wandi”: The kurrawoug, or pied-bell
magpie, has a loud, riugirg voice, which sounds as
he speeds on the wing like “Come along! Come
along! His relative, the grey-bell magpie, is
gifted with an equally strong voice and more
variety in' tone*. "It's going to rain!” is a fre-
quent prediction of his, no matter what kind of
weather he may be enjoying. Occasionally he an-
nounces that “Two add two are four,” throwing it
out with the joy of a schoolboy who has mastered
a difficult proposition in mathematics. The gill-
bird, whom the blacks call gurruwuk, cries mock-
ingly after the traveller, “Got to walk! Got to
wals! varied from time to time with “Humpin’
your swag! ’ The bobala (friar bird or leatherhead)
shouts. “Four o'clock!” in loud, clear tone* while
aeroplaning front one tree to another, or tumbling
among* the branches. He is a jolly scamp, and
comical-looking, with a roguish, naked, black head
and a prominent knob on top of his long bill. Now
and again, between his clarion calls, he utters a
low chuckle, as though his wife's application for a
maintenance-order had been dismissed. The noisy
tuinah, or garrulous honeyeater, rudely calls, ‘•(let
work! Get work!” The minah is the watchbird of
the bush. He shouts a warning to all the tribe
when a man, hawk or other enemy approaches, and
everyone within hearing, from the smallest tit to
the emu, is immediately ou the alert.

upon a wise choice of material,
therefore : Cut it out of “Viyella.”
“Viyella” is rich-looking in appear-
ance, and is produced in
a wide range of patterns.
It is delightfully soft and non-irritant to the tenderest
skin ; exceedingly durable ; does not shrink nor spoil
in the wash ; has special health-value in that it absorbs
and radiates the body’s moisture—preventing chills
due to climatic changes.-
Made in various weights, but only ONE quality. See that you get
“Yiyella. ’’ Suitable for men’s, women’s and children’s day and night
wear. Sold by all leading drapers and storekeepers. Look for the name
on the selvedge. If not procurable in your vicinity, the name of the

Business, Robbery, etc.
“T. Ash”: “Barcoo” says that red gum
is used for wheel-making in Victoria ind
that naves, spokes and shafts are turned out
from that timber. He’s wrong. I have had
over 30 years’ experience and have made
hundreds of wheels in A'ictoria, N. S. Wales
and Westralia, but have never known red
gum to be used for spokes or naves. It is
ideal timber for felloes, bolsters, etc.; but
as spokes and naves it wouldn’t last as long
as it took to make the wheel. Box nave,
ironbark spokes, red-gum felloes every time
for heavy wheels.
“Copabella,” from the grocery counter: —
The italicising of one sentence in “F.N.T. ’s”
reference (B. 6/l/’l6) to my mustard par. suggests
an ulterior motive in “F.N.T.’s” grocer. Of that I
can't speak: I wasn’t he. I wish I had been, for
1 have Australian mustard to unload. “F.N.T.’s”
par, however, fires a thought-train. Why does the
seller push certain lines and suppress others? Extra
profit, of course, says the looker-on. “F.N.T.’s”
grocer proves the rule, then, for his Australian
mustard costing lOd. and selling at 1 l)d. pays him
a gross 15 per cent., while the imported, costing
11 Ad. and selling at Is. Id., pays only 13 per cent.
Perhaps “F.N.T.’s” grocer really did believe he was
serving Mrs. T. better by pressing the imported.
Perhaps, though, as I do, he reasoned thus: Jere-
miah’s mustard (imp.) barks its virtues from every
hoarding; it sticks its bull head up out of every
paper and magazine; it shrieks in yellow and red
from every bare wall; it is a household word
throughout the world ; children babble its name and
recognise its trade-mark and posters. It sells itself,
and it pays 13 per cent. Bluegum brand will take
10 minutes’ push and persuasion to sell it; judging
by general demand it may not give satisfaction when
sold; it is so d— slow it may easily have gone
stale; the customer looks particular ; and it is only
2 per cent, better-paying, anyhow—better not chance
it! So he pushes Jeremiah’s. He isn’t, unpatriotic ;
he's only anaverage' business-man pushing what
pays; and to the average business-man, all things
being (nearly) equal, what pays best is best. As
to merit, that doesn’t enter —much. Saleability is
what the grocer looks for, anjl, in my experience, he
doesn’t get it in local mustard. Why, I dunno;
I’m a retailer of groceries, not an expert in domes-
tic economics. I blamed the goods—a wrong deduc-
tion, vide “F.N.T.” If the goods are all right, why,
in the name of the great god Private Enterprise,
doesn't the manufacturer tell the public so? Mean-
time, would I had met “F.N.T.” sooner! I could
have laid him on to a suburban lot of Australian
mustard very cheap—had I not mixed it with
pollard, brains, faith and a few other ambiguities
and sold it as “Two-Eggs-a-Day” Hen Spice,* 21b.
for a bob! I’m sorry now—not for the fowls (it
answered as well as any of the American fowl-
dopes), but for “F.N.T.” ; and a loss of Bd. a
pound!
* * * *
“Boronia” : The State sawmills of W.A.
having conelusively demonstrated that they
can turn out fruit cases made of karri
superior in durability and appearance to
fhe best imported, and at about half of the
cosjt, should be working at high pressure
to fill orders lor over 100,000 of them.
The reason the pressure isn’t as high as it
might be is that the supply of steel tape
which is used to bind the ends of the cases,
has petered out and it is doubtful whether
any more can be obtained from U.S.A.
while the fireworks boom is on. We have
the brains to turn out these ingenious col-
lapsible cases, but when we want common
steel tape it has to be dragged from a
foreign country thousands of miles away!

“D.F.”: Year’s output of ferout-fry
from the Plenty (Tas.) fish-hatchery A Rain-
bow trout, 780,500; brown trout, 521,000;
Quinnat salmon, 23,000; total, 1,324,500.
Then they sold 250,000 ova to the mainland,
mostly Ballarat and Geelong, and let loose
1100 yearling Quinnat salmon. Altogether
the year’s work added 1,575,600 to Aus-
tralia’s population of fresh-water fish. Con-
sidering the numbers previously released,
trout ought to be calling out for tra-ffic con-
stables in the streams of the Speck; but
they aren’t, and nothing like 1 per cent, of
those liberated are caught. It doesn’t seem
good fish-farming, somehow.
German Bay, the name of one of the
earliest settlements in Akaroa Harbor
(M.L.), goes off the map. The inhabitants
have been worried about their christening
ever since Bill went mad. There is a cheese
factory in the place, and it was felt that
the label “German Bay” wouldn’t recom-
mend the produce in England. So the
Government has consented to substitute
Takamatua Bay, Tak. being a famous
Maori chief who once lived there.
* * * *
From H. D. Bundle, who now lives in
California (U.S.A.) :
Standardised “packs” for fruit will have to be
enforced in Australia. The profits secured by
growers over here are due not so much to methods
of production as to standardisation of packing and
organisation in distribution. Raisin-growers three
years ago got 21 cents per lb. for their stuff. Then
they formed an association which takes the fruit in
bulk, grades it and packs it. Last year their 80,000
tons brought 5) cents for best quality—and they are
running into the English market, too. The orange-
growers v'hen unorganised were on a losing proposi-
tion. The Californian Fruit-growers’ Exchange was
started. The “Sun-kist” and “Red Ball” brands
were registered, and packs were standardised and
improved. But still there was something wrong.
Early fruit that colored first had been rushed on
the market when still immature and high in citric
acid. The U.S. Government, after laboratory experi-
ments, made it compulsory that oranges must show
eight parts solid to one part acid. Result, sales this
season have been the best for many years. Dried
peaches broug'ht 2§<l. in 1914. Growers have just
organised a big association calling for £150,000.
Result, outside packers offering 5 cents for 1916
crop. Yankee cultivation may not suit Australian
conditions, but Australian fruit in cases of uneven
grade, quality and appearance have as much chance
of competing with the Yank's packs in the world’s
markets as I have of swimming to Sydney.
* * * *
“F.G.”: I have just been looking at a
myriad-colored poster advertising a subdivi-
sion sale somewhere near Sydney, and am
impressed with the fact that Art has been
at last made the handmaiden of Commerce.
This is not only Art; it is True Art. Buyers
are coming from all quarters of the uni-
verse. An aviator swoops down from the
skies; country couples arrive in jinkers pur-
sued by horsemen; a motor-ear (imp.),
loaded with frivolity, dashes up; a train
de luxe has arrived at a place marked
“Station”; a swaggy butts in with his
bluey. A huge steamer is in sight, and
contrary to the custom of ships, is making
straight for the lighthouse, which flashes
dazzling beauts of light at noon. Also a
raging bull charges across the glittering
landscape. These are the details of the visi-
tation. But the local attractions are there
a-plenty. There is a display of fish. \
yacht and a motor-launch spin over the lake.
Surfers are bathing, and the angle at which
one of them is heading into the breakers
suggests arrival from Mars. A kookaburra,
taking a broad view of things from the top
of a signboard, is another local attraction.
’Tis a breezy bit of work these stodgy times.
I want to buy a block.
* * * *
“F.N.T.”: John Tilly, of the Adams
engineering firm of Sydney, which has sup-
plied the Commonwealth Navy with half
a score Tillico marine engines, has estab-
lished a sound claim to be framed and hung
in the Hall of Fame as the maker of the
first all-Australian aeroplane engine. The
claim was recently made in The Bulletin
on behalf of Aubrey Lock, of Melbourne,
who built his aero-engine in 1912, and the
honor goes to Melbourne anyway, since
Tilly was living there *t the time he made
his, in 1910. The castings and forgings
thereof were done in West Melbourne and
the only imported items were the magneto,
carburetter and plugs. In a discussion of
this sort, when some parts of the engine in
question are shown to have been imported,
the palm should properly go to the person
who did the least importing. The first en-
gine to be fitted with an Australian magneto
was that lately made by Tarrant’s, of Mel-
bourne, while Tilly and Lock each used a
Bosch ; but the award is reasonably made
as follows: 1. with gilt frame and hanging
above mentioned, John Tilly, 1910 (J. It.
Duigan. pilot) ; 2, Aubrey Lock, 1912-1913
(Alec Porter, pilot) ; 3, with special prize
for Australian magneto, Tarrant and Co.,
1915 (Commonwealth Aviation School,
pilots).
* * * *
“Pick”: How’s this for a record? A Bom-
bala (N.S.W.) butcher recently paid £llO
for two bullocks which he converted into
beefsteak. One carcase balanced 17401 b.,
and the other swung the beam at 1001 b.
better. The bullocks were reared out to-
wards Dalgety—the place that may yet be
the capital of Australia when Canberra and
King O'Malley’s hat are forgotten.
“ Jwosp”: A new industry was smothered
at birth in London owing to the careless-
ness of its originator. Bill Dubs got an
insurance on his house. When the Zeps came
along spilling things into nurseries and coffee
stalls. Bill set his own fireworks going and
then called on the insurance people to |et
his compensation. But the Hums had lost
their way and heaved their cargo a mile
or two south of Bill’s house. The Judge
thought that two miles was too long a throw
and said Bill could have six months.
* * * *
A deserting soldier in England was found
by the ticket-collector under the seat of a
railway carriage. He offered to pay his fare
and explained the situation: “I am an Aus-
tralian, and in my-country passengers gener-
ally travel under the seat for comfort.” He
got six months and deserved another six for
making bad use of a good joke.
THE CORNISH PUMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Ave you ’eard the Cornish pump a-squeakin’,
squeakin’ night an’ day,
Wiv ’er big rod goin’, goin', fer to bring th’ soak
away ?
Never takes no 'olidays like other ingines do,
But grafts ’er three shifts all th’ week, an’ goes
on Sundays, too;
Fer if she struck fer ’igher pay or stopped to take
a spell,
Th’ water’d rise an’ flood th’ drives an’ give the
work in’s ’ell;
So she squeaks away to th’ gaudy sun, an’ she
squeaks in th’ black ole dark,
An’ from Noo Year to December she repeats th’
same remark:
“Paroomm—phishsh,
Paroom m —phishsh’ ’ —•
Ain't she nuts on that remark?
’Ave you ’eard th’ Cornish pump a-sobbin’, sobbin’
soon an’ late,
Just as if she was a woman moanin’ at ’er crooel
fate?
She must never stop ’er graftin', by ’ard dooty she
is bound,
Fer if she should chuck ’er labors the ’ole show
’ould soon be drowned.
Oh, she takes no spell fer Chris’mas, an’ she
grafts th' Easter through—
Rain an’ sunshine, night an’ daytime, she ’as got
’er work to do—
Suckin’ all th’ muddy water up ’er rusty iron
throat,
Spittin’ where tli’ crick is runnin’, while she sobs
th’ same ole note:
“Pa roomm —phishsh,

Lord, she sticks on that ole note!
’Ave you ’eard th’ Cornish pump a-groanin’ that

From the deep shaft liftin’, liftin water by th’
koobic yard ?
Comes th’ boss an’ eyes ’er over, says she’s gettin’
out of date—•
Pumpin’ by a Tectric-motur is a way they've found

Thinks she’s glowin' ole an’ rusty an’ too stiff to
do ’er job,
So ’e’ll chop ’er rod fer firewood an’ ’e’ll scrap ’er

But she keeps on graftin’, graftin’, though ’er

An’ she'll groan until th’ finish what she groaned

THE UNIVERSAL CAR
Most Economical Motor-car in the World to Buy.
THERE is no better proof of the efficiency of a motor-
car—or for that matter, any other machine or article
, , the P ubhc demand for it. Therefore, when it is a
tact that there are considerably over One Million (1 000 000)
(!) FORD Motor-cars sold and paid for, the world over it
may justly be inferred that the FORD is the most popular
and efficient motor-car in the world.
. recent census disclosed an average
of 450 FORDS sold monthly. This average per month "is
rapidly, approaching 500. Total FORDS on Australian roads
is now about 13,500.
Every FORD is a salesman (and a good salesman) in
addition to being an automobile.
Cheapest in the World to Maintain.
MR. FRAXCTS BIRTLES, tlie renowned Australian
Explorer, through the medium of the phenomenal
FORD has been enabled to complete five trans-
Australian journeys aggregating 37,000 miles, pene-
trating into portions of Central and Northern Australia
formerly unknown to a white man. Mr. Birtles left Melbourne
again on 29th December last in a FORD car on an additional
trip across country below the Gulf of Carpentaria. Surely
no greater compliment could be accorded to any car than
this gentlemair’s choice. Moving pictures of portions of Mr.
Birtles’s trans-Australian exploits are occasionally showing
at various picture-theatres, from which a practical illustration
of FORD capabilities may be obtained.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Overworked Prime Minister Hughes, who
suffered badly from German jumps before he
left, passed the business of cutting the Teu-
ton out of Australian cos. to Iliggs and
Mahon; and those two, less brilliant but
better balanced, have been finding difficulties
by the dozen. If the Government said to
the German shareholder “You must "sell” it
also said to the Australian shareholder who
couldn’t afford to see his stock slaughtered,
You must buy,” and that was just what the
Government didn't want to say at present,
when it is out after war loans.' In the end
the Government adopted the adequate
measure of merely compelling cos. to transfer
enemy-aliens’ holdings to a public trustee,
who will either sell or hold at his discretion.
That, while making the German shareholder
innocuous, doesn’t hit either Australian
shareholders or the Government in the eye,
as Hughes’s raw scheme would certainly
have done.
SENDING HIM OFF.
THE KID: "Sec, ’c don't want ter go ter the
war, so they've got ter carry ’im.”
’lhe. report of the select committee
appointed to inquire into the matter of a
site for a National arsenal gives another
wallop to the optimists who have tried to
magnify the Molonglo trickle into a river
of “ample proportions.” As a plentiful
supply of water is required at every stage
of munition making, the report states, the
Molonglo River must be passed over. Yet
upon this stream the Federal capital is
being built. The City of the Great Un-
washed !
The champion reply to the recruiting card
arrived in Malvern (Vic.). The patriot ex-
plained his position in one grand, terse sen-
tence: “ I’m holding myself in reserve.’’
( An official statement has been made by
Railways Commissioner McClelland as to the
attitude of the Victorian Commissioners
towards their German employees. It proves
to be identical with the principle estab-
lished by the State Government. “As long
as they behave themselves,” the edict goes,
“Germans and others of foreign descent will
be allowed to continue in the service.” That
looks simple, and has the appearance of
British fairplay and all that. Yet if there
is one German native, unmarried, employed
by the Commissioners or by the Government
of Victoria, while the returned Gallipolite
is chasing around for a billet, the principle
is a poor thing. The Victorian Railways
Commissioners are a somewhat fatly-con-
tented gathering of well-salaried citizens;
and so, for that matter, is the Government
of the State. The let-’em-alone principle
and the tolerant attitude are easy to such
people. But what is easy isn’t always right,
if there is any chasing to be done for a job,
it is a lot more righteous to let the German
do it.
THE SACRIFICE OF THE DRY DOG.
Freetrade went like a flash of smoke when dealing
with the arehtraitor of humanity. —George Reid.
Australia’s strike reeoid since Billjim
tar ted out to fight:—
Jf. S. Wales, 391 ; Victoria, 46; Queensland, 17 ;
S. Australia, 17 ; Westralia, 11 ; Tasmania, 4 ; North-
ern Territory, 7 ; Canberra F. T., 1. Total, 494.
And that is how, in a country where strikes
are illegal, the workers carry out their own
Irime Minister's promise to'give to the war
'the last man and the last shilling.”
A good deal of earnest grumbling has been
heard as the result of the recent State Par-
liamentary trip to Gippsland—the growling
being all the more hearty because the legis-
lators took a number of relatives on the pic-
nic. It would have been difficult to excuse
the outing in peaceful times; but with the
Red Cross funds still inadequate and sol-
diers comforts provided on what is at best
a meagre scale, the excursion looks more like
a crime than a misdemeanor. Here is a
little word-picture painted by an enraged
Bairnsdale man:—
During part of the evening one side of the street
where a recruiting-meeting was being held, was dark
and gloomy, whilst on the other side the hotels were
makers 13118 ° Ut " ith the J ests of die merry law-
It is enough to make any real Australian
patriot feel glum, particularly if he has a son
at the Front; but it is nothing short of an
outrage to call on that same taxpaving
patriot to help with a bill for three doz.

for no less than 138 revellers.
t» ' H ay i n f? rolled his sleeves up,
i .Ai.c,. \\ ebster might as well overhaul the
lettergram traffic; also the abuse thereof as
a fa ctor contributing to the loss of £lO.OOO
a week. Phis “convenience” is a night let-
ter telegraphed to the office of destination
and delivered by the letter-carrier on his
rounds next morning. It was designed for
private and domestic use, but P. Enterprise,
who deals in onions and wheat and shares,
seized the loophole with both hands and his
teeth, so to speak. Instead of telegraphing
m the ordinary way (16 words Is.) P. Enter-
prise hangs off till evening and then gets 40
words through for Is. Sweating operators
are handed piles of these “ grams” about
the price of bags and ship-cargoes and fresh
eggs. There is a heavy loss on the traffic,
and for two reasons the Department deserves
to be kicked—one because Private Enterprise
thus takes it down, the other because the ser-
vice is so bad that ordinary telegrams lodged
in (say) Perth at 1 o’clock or later come
through no sooner than a lettergram lodged
at i o clock. Both are delivered next morn-
The latest order directed to the multitudi-
nous Australian censor is that no paper or
periodical may publish any statement “in
such way as to suggest that any alteration,
addition or omission has been made by the
censorship.” In other words, what is not the
paper’s opinion or view of the facts must go
out as if it were, for the more effectual
deluding of its readers. The only possible
comment upon this is that
It is a sign of the times that a member of
the Vic. Board of Health lately moved that
syphilis be made a notifiable disease. The
chairman explained that the Peacock Minis-
try had promised to deal with the matter at
an early date. So we shall see —some day.
Meantime it is worthy of note that there
were some members of the Board who com-
plained that they thought notification would
“do more harm than good.” If so, why notify
smallpox and meningitis and plagueV Why,
in fact, have a Board of Health or do any
blessed thing at all?
Sydney Daily Telegraph bleats very
loudly about “Kings in Exile” :—•
The dethroned and exiled kings of these small
States are terribly pathetic figures. Though the
King [of Montenegro] has lost his throne at Cet-
tinge he retains his crown in exile in Italy....and
can say with W. E. Henley:—•
‘‘Beneath the bludgeonings of fate,
My head is bloody but unbowed.”
King Albert is living with his wife in a cottage.
King Peter is refuging in Salonika. These three
monarchs epitomise in their persons all the heart-
break and misery of the small nations.
What sane man can see any king’s misery
when the people of these nations are home-
less, starving and dying of disease? If the
King of Montenegro has lost the obsolete
chair called a throne he can still pawn his
crown in Rome, and he has never had a
bludgeon on the head so far as can be dis-
covered. Albert of Belgium has a wife and
a cottage, while most working Belgians have
lost both; and Peter of Servia is safe in
Salonika while the heroic common Servians
rot on the mountain roads. Australians are
hard headed, and when the Daily Tele-
graph weeps over the melodramatic sorrows
of these kings it is in danger of turning the
stomach of the people against the war.
Postmaster-General Webster was speaking
the other day about the “ideal post office”—
a vast building with millions of pigeon-holes
and ample air space and a restful dining
hall; a palatial place of order and repose
It seemed a very fine ideal. But The
Bulletin has "another sort of ideal—a post
that will positively refuse to lose
±oUU,UUO per annum of the Australian tax-
payers’ cash ; that will be fitted with a mul-
titude of contrivances for preventing the
elusive Id. from disappearing down the
drain; that will deliver the letter it hasn’t
lost and produce the telegram at the other
end of the wire without dropping some of it
on the May; that will have a telephone
exchange through which a citizen may ring
up someone else without having to wait
more than 27 $ minutes and cursing all the
rest of the day because he was prematurely
cut oft. It looks a poor, squalid sort of an
ideal; but then it’s a mere taxpayer’s and
telephonemser’s ideal, and perhaps that
makes a difference.

‘‘Under the voluntary system” »
llampson, M.H.R., of Bendigo, “it is S !? S
brave who fight for the slackers, the cm*

to Uampson as so right and proper that he
won't do a thing to alter it.
THE COMPULSORY VOLUNTEERS
“Dealt, deah! What did you tell this
Hughes fellah?"
“I told him I’d not volunteeah till they
made it compulsory .”
Since good old Epsom salts is six times
as dear as it was before the war, while anti-
pyrin is 755. instead of 77d., acetylsalicylic
(the basis of aspirin) has gone up from 22d.
to 645., and various other shocking things
have happened in the drug business, the
council of the Pharmaceutical Society of
Australasia is seeking the co-operation of
the various branches of the British Medical
Association, asking members to assist in
“alleviating the somewhat tense position
created by the scarcity of certain drugs”
The proposal which the Pharmaceutical
Society makes is that, where at all permis-
sible, medical men should avoid prescribing
the almost-unprescribable. It seems an art-
less sort of suggestion, unaccompanied as it
is by any special exhortation or appeal to
Australia to get busy and produce its own
chemicals. Perhaps if the Pharmaceutical
Society were to prepare a list of its most
desperate needs and indicate how they might
be filled, the Prime Minister’s locum tenens
might “start something” here and now. Ask
ing the kind doctor not to prescribe Epsom
salts, because that popular drug is dear and
scarce, looks a foolish method of grappling
with the problem. We must have a supply
some time. And unless we do something it
will come from Germany, and the money
we pay for our cure will later on be used
for our killing.

A' oca will probably

But what a travesty
on the Speck’s ex-
pensive system of government!
Both Commonwealth and State have gone

body of apparently licensed lawbreakers call-

permits to certain men to go on to other

SKITE F. FIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How doth the politician prate
In after-dinner speeches
Of Billjim’s duty to the State!
How bravely he beseeches
His fellow-creatures to enlist
Who now are busy shirking!
Well, some of him would not be missed
If they went in for working.
Some talkers of the fighting age
Who ought to be in trenches
Lag on the legislative stage
And 101 l on cushioned benches.
Of manhood that should meet the foe
Each claims to be a sample;
Then why the dickens don’t they go
And set a good example?
The cry of Blatherskite, M.P.,
Within my mind arouses
A logical desire to see
Conscription for the Houses.
But though we need it far and wide
For men of all conditions,
It never will be self-applied
By skiting politicians.
VICTORIA.

Of the 90 Australian works which have come under the reviewer’s notice from the
publisher, this is the cleverest, so far as literary form is concerned. The theme of the writing
proves an almost amazing insight into character as well as gift of mental analysis which is
rare. The book is frankness itself. It is true to human nature, it is diverting ; it is also
instructive and it teaches useful lessons in a semi-cynical way, but the central idea is at
least daring.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A particularly warm sporting quarrel is
on in Adelaide. Simeon Barnard, the old racing
man, has openly charged the Onkaparinga Racing
Club with not dealing squarely with the Belgian
Fund, to which half its last year’s Easter Monday
profits were promised. It is easy to see how there
can b'e two sides to this question. The Club, unlike
others, races on only one day in the year, and has,
from one point of view, to get back all its year’s
expenses before it can be said to make any profit.
On the other hand, “half the profits” might mean
half the receipts in excess of the outgoings on the
one day. The popular sportsmen who compose the
Club remark tersely that (1) The accounts are pro-
perly audited ; (2) The statements made are “lying,
malicious and wilfully, slanderous”; (3) “If Mr.
Barnard had got his complimentary member’s and
luncheon tickets they would have heard nothing
about the matter.” Now Paris Nesbit jumps in, say-
ing that he has been acting hitherto as Mr. Bar-
nard’s solicitor, but is now “taking the matter up
as one of the public interested in seeing clean
dealing.”
* * * *
Buried at Long Bay, Sydney, on January
21, Edward Flood, once of Lake Midgin, Berida and
Quambone stations, and last-to-go son of Edward
Flood, M.L.C., who was Secretary for Public Works
in the Cowper-led 1859 Ministry. “Ned” raced
extensively in his Quambone days, - and his efforts
led to a healthy improvement in Western sport.
His stables, with Mark Thompson as commandant,
sheltered, amongst many good-’uns, Cerise and Blue—
which later, in another livery, won a Sydney Cup—-
and Mvles-Na-Coppalein, a Backbloeks champion.
There will be many a kind word for “Old Ned,”
whose long life of 84 years was crowded with
generosity.
“B. J.”: Jimmy McGregor, who has pro-
bably had more accidents than any other Australian
jock, is now in khaki. A fall in Maoriland 10 years,
ago left him helpless for two years, and he has
had some nasty tumbles since. The year before last
he spent a couple of months in hospital in Melbourne.
Another cross-country rider, Don Williamson, tried
to enlist about the same time, but was turned down
because his left leg was a trifle short, the result of
a fracture some time back. Another jockey who
tried to pass the doctor but failed was Ronald
Cameron, who rode The Parisian to victory in the
Melbourne Cup in 1911. It was an old riding
injury that prevented Cameron’s acceptance; still
he was fit enough to ride a couple of winners over
hurdles a week or two before he offered himself.
Charlie Cooper, who five or six years ago won both
the Newmarket Handicap and the Australian Cup on
Queen o’ Scots, and Tom Kyle, who can ride any-
thing that ever tried to jump a hurdle, were among
early acceptors in the Armageddon Stakes. Kyle
took part in the first landing at Gallipoli, and was
one of the best of snipers. A sane Defence Depart-
ment would, of course, have found special work for
these other specialists to do. But no business-man
who has had experience of the Australian Defence
Department will ever suspect it of sanity. It is
part haw, part bluff, and a big part muddle; and
there s also a bad smell in a few places.
David James won a small race at
Kapunda (S.A.) last week. The only point of in-
terest about this fact is that it was nearly three
years since the once-prominent owner had captured
anything. The winner, Little Joan, though hitherto
a maiden at four years old, is beautifully bred, being
by Pistol out of James’s old Melbourne Cup winner,
Auraria.
When Machine Boy won the A.J.C. Anni-
versary Handicap last week the fool punter lifted up
his voice and filled the air with noise, for had not
this prad a day or two before, when backed at odds-
on to win the Trial Stakes, gone down with a heavy
thud and left the public cash in the yawning bags
of Israel? Yet the punter was only proclaiming his
asininity. In the Trial the horse was run almost
off his legs at the start, and had he not stumbled
badly in the straight would have been second. In
the Anniversary there was 171 b. less on top of him,
and the journey was accomplished without excessive
hurry over the earlier stages. But, naturally, all
those who had lost a half-sov. on him the first day
and dropped more good cash by backing something
else this time felt that on general principles thcv
ought to be mad about something or other, so they
went mad accordingly—and being still insane hurried
round trying to find the winner of the next.
“Sheila”: Isn’t it time the A.J.C. and
other clubs furnished the newspapers with starting
prices ? Bookmakers in giving this information to
the press are apt to make mistakes. Two cases in
point—Quinn’s Post (25 to 1) and Petalster (7 to
1), in the Challenge Stakes and Welter, at Randwick.
Any amount of 100 to 3 could be got about the
Challenge winner, and just before the start “10 to
1 Petalster” was being yelled with much more
energy than the nag presently showed.
There is one good point about n hurdle
race—the punter who backs an animal which falls
down can always reckon he might have turned his
ticket into cash if the calamitous animal had stood
up. Incidentally, the books don’t have to wait till
the end to see where some of the money is going to
stay. At Rosehill (Sydney) on Saturdav there was
a good deal of this. Six started in the hurdles, and
after going a mile one toppled over. Then the
favorite went to the front, but was so exhausted by
the effort that on arrival at the second-to-last jump
he landed in a heap on the other side. This left
something else in front with only one fence between
himself and the bacon, and as he was a 10-to-l
chance the punter whose money was there felt he
was starting the day well. But the brute hung at the
obstacle such a long time that 20 to 1, which had
been toiling along in the rear without a hope in the
world, leaped over first and won amidst tremendous
silence —except from Ikey who mostly hadn’t been
asked about him. And as 20 to 1 came to light in
the next two races, Ikey felt that Holman’s “taxa-
tion” was turning out fairly well, after all.
Mujik’ : Talking about hurdlers coming
down reminds me. It was on a M.L. course, and
some wild-looking navvies had heard something
Approaching a bookie they asked for tote odds on it.
“Right-oil,” he remarked, and accepted £lO, and
he wasn’t a very prosperous Ikey either. But he
stood the chance on the rank outsider, and when he
climbed up on the fence to watch the race 10
navvies climbed up beside him to be there iii case he
wanted assistance. The outsider hopped away in
the lead, and, jumping like a deer, was soon about
100yds. ahead of the field; and all the while 10
large navvies watched Ikey, and Ikey felt his heart
dropping nearer and nearer to his boots. There may
have been £2O in his clothes, and the brute was
paying well over a score on the machine! The
leader swept into the straight far ahead, with the
boy sitting as still as a rabbit, when —“Over!” It
came like a shriek from the Home of Released Souls,
as Ikey felt the hand of Fate drag him from the
pit. The leader had bowled head over heels across
the fence and broken its neck. Something else
arrived and won, but Ikey didn’t wait to see. He
slowly climbed down from amongst the navvies,
thoughtfully wiped the cold sweat from his neck
and bought himself a brandy. Long afterwards I
asked him if he would take a risk like that again.
“Not for a thousand,” he said. “But if I hadn’t
taken I might have been battling still.”
“Merrigal” : The passing of the Eumaralla
stud farm to a fresh locality recalls the glories of
the racing and breeding establishments presided
over in bygone days by the Rouse brothers, who
were grandsons of the founder of the family, one
Richard Rouse, who came to N. S. Wales in 1801,
settled at Parramatta during the regime of the
Reverend Samuel Marsden there, and had a farm at
Toongabbie close by. The Rouse brothers’ stud
was the most famous of its time, and any horsehide
that carried their plain “R” trademark—and it was
known throughout the length and breadth of N.S.W.
and Queensland—was always looked upon by
turf practitioners as a foe to be reckoned with.
Who can forget their Marvellous (sire of Marvel),
Wilberforce (sire of Hastings, Cerise and Blue), and
that jump and flat-race producer Grandmaster ? In
the palmy days of Western racing, Rouse’s string,
oyer which the famous old-time mentor, Noah Beal,
wielded the brush and currycomb, always made
things lively and left its mark with Sting, Waxy,
Marvellette (dam of Marvel Loch) and numerous
others. “Guntawang” Dick, grandson of the origi-
nal, used to say “go” at Randwick in pre-barrier
days, and his cousin (called, to save confusion,
Birigambil” Dick) was one of the best amateur
horsemen and horse judges of his day, while Leslie,
a son of the latter, has lately retired from employ-
ment with the A.J.C. and assumed the directorship
of the Ma State’s equine stud encyclopaedia.

“Barcoo”: “Rangan’s” (B. 20/l/’IG)
experience at the Queensland pony meeting, where,
when the “pea did n*ot win, the race was run over
again with satisfactory results, recalls a happening
at Tallarook (Vic.) races about 25 years ago. Bill
Fox was the principal publican, a bachelor, sport,
good sort, a white man, and in mam’ ways a father to
the township. He had a mare, My Dream, in the hurdle
race, the first event on the card.* She was a 2 to 1 on
favorite with the Irish natives, who were club, com-
mittee and judge. In the race the mare failed by a
long head ; but before the judge could declare he and
his temporary perch were emptied into the dust.
The Irish were galvanised into action as one man,
the booth was wrecked in a flash, and the air was
filled with empty and full beer bottles. Jack Burke,
the Irish Lad,” who livened John L. for five rounds
and 100 quid, and whom Slavin accounted for in a
punch at their second meeting in Melbourne, was
then a favorite fielder in the Hibernian districts, and
his sparring partner, Ryan, was his penciller. For a
moment or two the pair were struck dumb. Then
they broke loose in the interests of law and order,
backed by other sports who carried a punch about
them. The fall of the natives was rapid. When the
judge wiped the black soil out of his eyes and saw
the piles of counted-outs he declared “no decision”
in the race, and ordered it to be run over again.
My Dreajn won by a street. Then, even with the
exception of a few broken heads, everything in the
garden was lovely.

Adelaide municipality lias dealt a heavy
blow to the practice of betting on racing events at
a distance. It is not concerned with the morality
- or otherwise of the practice, though S.A. law makes
ail betting illegal unless conducted on a racecourse
through the totalisator. What annoys the City
r athers is the crowding round shops—tobacconists’,
mostly—to see results posted. So henceforth “no
writing, print, picture or other thing, whether
mechanical or otherwise, indicating the progress
stage or result of any sports or contest, may be ex-
hibited from any premises where it is visible from
the public thoroughfare.” This will knock out even
test-match results —though the dailies have not re-
cently done much as free news-distributors; it will

and Tiser as to which got the finish of the Mel-

One of the West Coast ("M.L.) racing
clubs decided to give an outing at Christmas time
to all the harmless members of a big mental hospi-
tal in the locality. So it set aside one of its stands
to accommodate these special visitors, who attended
in force and enjoyed the day immensely. On the
last race -Napoleon, who was present, had a little
bet of £lOO,OOO to £1 with a pal over a moke, and
when it failed to last out the distance Nap. was

he handed over his lOU, that a man must be mad

“Nyren”: Lieut.-Col. Melville Mac-
naghten, of Sydney, recently C.M.G.’d, is a son of the
late Sir Melville Macnaghten, chief of Scotland Yard.
Macnaghten senior is said (on the testimony of the
son) to be the only man who knew the facts relating
to the famous “Jack the Ripper’’ murders. The
secret, if he had it, died with him. The younger
Macnaghten is well known in Sydney (he resided at
Woollahra), and although engaged in studying law
found time to attend to military and sporting. He
is a great hockey enthusiast, and guided the des-
tinies of the State Association for some time. In
addition he did a bit for the press. He left Sydney
as a major.

It is not often that twin brothers are
found in a first-grade cricket XI.; but Sydney 'Uni-
versity team has a pair in Basil W. and Bernard
M. Riley. On Saturday Basil scored 85 not out
and Bernard 36, against Gordon, besides which
Bernard took 10 wickets for 103 runs. These boys
are alike as two long beers at Bourke, and mem-
bers of the team are caused some difficulty thereby;
but it’s nothing to the difficulty other teams might
experience. If Basil happened to be in good form
with the bat, and capable of making 100 before
being put out, it could be arranged to give him four
bangs in the two innings; and if Bernard was
bowling at an average of six for 36 there would
be nothing to prevent him making havoc from both
ends. The only other record of twins in the one
team that this paper knows of is dated about 25
years back, when, at Sydney, Fred and Frank
Rounsevell (survival's of triplets) played for the then
prominent first Junior Club, Ivanhoe. They were also,
champion Australian Rules football players.
“Mul” : What is the finest catch or series
of catches known by any sport to have been done
in the one match? I witnessed a test at Adelaidfc
a few years back in which there were three.
1 yldesley was the victim twice. In his first innings
he was magnificently caught by Kelly behind the
wickets, the keeper jumping fully a' yard across
to the leg side to effect the catch. At the English-
man’s second try Noble at short square-leg brought
off a superb one-handed catch. Tyldesley was un-
doubtedly unlucky to be dismissed by two such
catches in the one game. The third catch was
made by Macartney who, running at full pace
along the ropes, effected a glorious one-handed
catch off a low drive from Hardstaffe. Writer, how-
ever, gives the palm to the catch made by the late
Harry Graham on the M.O.C. ground when, after
running at his top, h 6 leaned back over the ropes
and secured the leather one-handed.

A good old English sport has just con-
cluded an innings of 91—Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane.
He was a diplomat in Palmerston’s time; but is best
remembered as a cricketer. He was the oldest mem-
ber of the M.C.C., having joined in 1840. In con-
junction with his elder brother, Lord Bessborough,
ar ' l J ; L- Baldwin he founded the famous I. Zingari
Club in ’45, and played with it for many years.
Over £6OO has been distributed among
the 18-footers this season on Port Jackson. A
succession of light leading winds on the last few
Saturday afternoons has enabled the long-markers to
grab a deal of the cash, but the two scratch-mark
boats, Kismet and Scot, with £69 and £56, still
head the prize list. Yet neither has been in a
winning place for six weeks. Kismet was out to roll
away with £lOO for the season, but she will require
to shake a leg if she is to get it now.

: ■ The America Cup (B.
ul, 16) takes its name from the schooner-yacht
America, which in 1851 crossed over to race in
British waters, but could not at first get a match
because, though she was a 180-tonner, she would
not concede any time-allowance to smaller competi-
tors. The Royal Yacht Squadron, however, in the
sporting spirit characteristic of British yachtsmen
provided a cup to be sailed for on the visitor’s own
terms. The race was round the Isle of Wight, and
as the wind was strong, the big schooner, unhandi-
capped, scored a matter-of-course win. But she
was, in any case, a very fast craft, and her con-
cave bows and full after-body completely upset the
, cod s-head-and-mackerel’s-tail” ’ ideal 'of racing
build. Her canvas, also, was cut to set as flat ai

Adelaide has at last got the bylaws it
needed to control its street traffic. They forbid any
thing—motor-buses seem to be aimed at--to draw
up near a corner, or near a stationary tramear
Speed in passing a tramear that is setting down
passengers is cut down to three miles an hour. On
the other hand, the reckless females who stand all
over the two-chain-wide King William-street waiting
for a car that is to be along sometime are forbidden
to be more than 6ft. from the kerb. Any recklessly,
inclined cj-clist is not to have both hands or both
feet off at once, and the motor-bikist may no longer
carry a girl perched on the back. The' slower the
traffic the nearer it must keep to the kerb —a highly
necessary arrangement, but hitherto unknown to
Adelaide.

Yarrum”: The best line fisherman on

know it! It is a treat to see James hauling them

His record is 103 whiting (lewt. 101 b. of fish) in an

“C.G.”: “Sardonyx” (B. 13/1/TG) is in
error when he speaks of Jem Ward (known in the
bare-knuckle days as the “Black Diamond”) as the
unbeaten champion of England. Ward was beaten
by Josh Hudson (the “John Bull” fighter) at Moulsev
Hnrst, on November 11, 18*23, in 15 rounds, occupy-
ing 35 minutes. He was also compelled to strike his
colors to Peter Crawley (“Young Rump Steak”)
upon Royston Heath, in Cambridgeshire, on January
2, 1827, after a battle of 11 rounds. Now a word
with “Eryander,” who in the same issue said: “Mace
afterwards most conclusively turned the tables on
King.” King and Mace never met again after the
victory of King over Mace in November, 1862. King
appeared within the ring once only afterwards, and
“1® opponent upon that occasion was Ileenan (the
Benicia Boy”), from America.

Medicine Quickly Banishes All
Foot Ailments
To those who are troubled with sore, tender,
aching, swollen, perspiring, unpleasant smelling
feet, bunions, corns or hard skin, “BIFF” will
bring quick relief and gladness to the feet. Use
BIFF” today and banish all pain and discomfit.
By using “BIFF” once a week you will insure
your feet against all foot troubles. “BIFF” is a
scientific compound which draws out all poisonous
matter from the feet, which clog and choke pores
of the skin. One application of this unique com-
pound will render the feet sweet and antiseptic.
Its delightful results must be experienced to be
believed.
MRS. CARTER WRITES : —For years my feet
gave me much trouble. It was purgatory to
have to walk far, but after using one box of
Biff” I can walk with perfect ease and com-
fort, there is nothing to compare with your
( preparation for foot trouble.”
“Biff” can be obtained through all chemists and
stores ; if not in stock send direct to the manu-
facturers. Price Is. 6d. per box, or triple size box
4s. (triple box contains three times the Is.6d. size).

Have You a BAD LEG
perhaps surrounded with inflammation and
swollen, that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression?
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Perhaps
your knees are swollen, the joints being
. ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored. The disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended
hospitals and been told your case is hopeless,
or advised to submit to amputation, but do
not. Try the great British Remedy:—
GRASSHOPPER

which you will find a certain remedy.
Also for Poisoned Hands, House-

Tulle —Stylish
& Economical
In the selection of millinery, if style
with economy is the aim, Tuile —" Dynamo"
Rainproof Tulle —is a trimming that will
satisfy all your requirements.
•I Light, soft, and summery in character, “Dy-
namo” is more than durable —it is weather-resis-
ting. If caught in a shower or a heavy down-
pour you simply shake your hat till the tulle is
dry—the shimmering fabric immediately regains
the fresh, crisp look it had when new.
t| And when you think that “Dynamo” costs
dered Rainproof—that your hat
can be daintily trimmed with it
for a trifling cost—you must admit
that its economy is most practical.

Arthur H. Adams’s “Mrs. Pretty and the
Premier” has had such an enthusiastic re-
ception in Birmingham and Manchester that
Bourchier has decided to drop all his other
plays and put on only the Australian
comedy for the rest of his provincial tour,
which was to have ended on January 17.
If the play keeps on as well as it has
begun. Bourchier will put it on in London
as soon as he can get a theatre in the
spring, with some immunity from Zeppelins.
In Birmingham the comedy was produced
for one night only under the title of “The
Division Bell,” but on reaching Manchester
Bourchier reverted to the author’s original
title.
Victor Gouriet, who came here to play
I'opoff in "The Merry Widow,” and re-
mained to do some passable work in other
musical comedies, has been given a per-
manent job at London Gaiety.
“The Nomad”: Brisbane Amateur Opera-
tic Society was a mighty successful concern
until a month ago when the heads of some of
the younger members burst through their hat-
bands and they commenced to raise Cain.
President E. R. Isaacs and a couple of others
who had been mainly responsible for the
success of the 8.A.0.5. were “shooed” off
the premises. But most of the music the
affair contained seemed to go with them and
the shell left behind is empty and soundless.
Isaacs immediately set about the creation of
a new society, and even in this short space
of time he has gathered round him a stronger
and more influential committee than the old
one and has secured the best of the amateur
talent in Brisbane, including Arthur Crane,
Vic Jensen, Royston Marcus, Learmonth,
Mrs. S. B. Harris, Tessie Mulcahy and Jule
Wilson. The new society is taking on Offen-
bach’s “Tambour Major,” which it hopes to
stage at His Majesty’s in May.
From a man in the trade:—
We have been trying to locate the first Christmas
pantomime produced here in England. The earliest
record so far traced is that of one pre-
sented at Drury Lane on Boxing Day, 1702, and
bearing the title of “Tavern Bilkers.” It was
written and produced by John Weaver, a dancing-
master of the period, who was a friend of Addison
and Steele. Oinderellas and Aladdins soon displaced
the tavern-bilkers, and have reigned ever since.
Australian pantos, have been, for the most part, mere
perversions of the Drury Lane productions, though
W. M. Akhurst supplied a few Melbourne successes.
Akhurst, who was on the staff of the Herald,
migrated to London, and had a panto, or two pro-
duced here; but finding the market too crowded he
decided to return to Melbourne. He never saw it
again, though, for he died on the voyage.
The Censor riddled Pshaw’s “O’Flaherty,
A .C.,” so badly that! Bernard wouldn’t own
the thing, and consequently the Dublin
production was abandoned.
“J.F.H.”: Some queer Australian P.P.
legends circulate in England. Here, for
instance, is A. E. Anson, now playing in
"Romance,” telling the London Evening
News that when his father, G.W., was in
Australia “the N.S.W. House of Assembly
adjourned business to attend his farewell
benefit, a great compliment to the veteran
actor.” Does anybody remember that inter-
esting incident? Or is old-man Anson like
George 111., who came to believe that he
really won the battle of Waterloo? “G.W.,”
who may be pleasantly remembered by old
Australian playgoers as a bright and
breezy comedian, is still in harness. He has
just celebrated the 50th anniversary of his
first stage appearance, his jubilee being
duly honored in Nebraska, U.S.A., where he
is on tour with a co. playing “The Liars.”
by Henry Arthur Jones.
“Kaniva”: The vaudeville stage is short
of a handclap through the passing of that old-
time Australian comedian, Charles Fanipg,
who stopped for good on December 4 at
Capetown, S’Africa. He had gone on tour
of the Black Continent with his wife,
Georgie Devoe. Failing was a favorite
throughout the whole of Australia, and had
been keeping gloom at bay for close on 30
years.
“Norbell”: Dan Barry always had an
Australian drama on the menu—“ The Kelly
Gang,” “The Squatter’s wife,” “Ransom,”
and so on. Nor was he above labelling (or
libelling) the imported bellow with an Aus-
tralian title. When Sparkes and O’Connor,
two notorious crooks, broke gaol at Pent-
ridge, Dan promptly produced “Escaped
from Pentridge” at Brunswick (Vic.). Meet-
ing him in Bourke-street I asked where he dug
up the latest thriller. “Oh,” said Daniel,
“it’s good old ‘Lost in London’ with a prison
scene pushed into the second act —and it's
packin’ the house !”
“O’Pliimerty”: “Harrison 0.,” whom I
back as the world’s champion heavyweight
dogmatist, says (B. 2/J2/T5) that the
I .S.A. have failed to produce a really great
novelist. Where would he place Nathaniel
Hawthorne and what does he say of “The
Scarlet Letter” and “The House of Seven
Gables”? Also has he never heard of
George W. Cable, Joel Chandler Harris,
Ilopkinson Smith and Edith Wharton? If
these are not gfeat, the reason why would
be an interesting subject for one of Harri-
son’s lectures.

With proper scorn his menace braved.
A gorgeous lady, most depraved,
Followed the hero everywhere.
By turns, within the limelit glare,
The maiden wept in lone despair,
The suffering hero moaned and raved,
The villain hissed.

Laid all the villain’s plotting bare 1
The will was found, the papers saved,
The hero won the bride he craved,
And all the gods assembled there

wem? London
The Directors of the largest hotel
in the Empire, or even in Europe,
a magnificent hostelry completed
and opened in June last, ordered
from us a Beale Horizontal Grand
Piano for the principal reception
room. We have no London show-
rooms, but had supplied an order for
pianos, also quite unsolicited, for
their other large hotel, the Strand
Palace. Instructions were sent to
us from London in iqiq as follows :
“ We wish you to make, for use in
“ the Re gent Palace Hotel, now in
“ course r f erection at Piccadilly
“ Circus : One full-sized Concert
“ Grand Piano in burr walnut, latest
“ model with only exterior ornamen-
“ tation sufficient to be dignified.
“ We think it unnecessary to give you
“ any instructions as to quality—
“ as you will know to supply an
“ instrument of the best.”
We have since received letters of
strong commendation from con-
noisseurs of high reputes upon the
instrument.
Even in time of war, this handsome
hotel, whose splendid reception
rooms are finished as examples of
strictly classical architecture, is
crowded daily with visitors. Any-
one sojourning in London who omits
to call at the Regent Palace, a id
everyone goes . to Piccadilly Circus,
misses one of the finest sights of the
great Metropolis.
There are about 1200 bedrooms, and
the whole of the arrangements are
modern, hygienic and comfortable.
The Beale Pianos were awarded at
the great Franco-British Exhibition,
London, 1938, Grand Prize and three
Gold Medals for their points of excel-
lence, being the highest award given
for any pianos.

Lloyd : We said “Australia’s chief, almost
sole, sources of supply [of ‘news’ paper] are Scan-
dinavia and North America.” You ask us to say
this is “quite wrong” because Edward Lloyd has a
mill in England. And then you add: “The pulp is
drawn chiefly from Edward Lloyd’s own mill in
Norway, but purchases are also made from Canada.”
Buy an atlas, and turn up Norway and Canada....
Stevack (and others) : Pars are not acknowledged
here. If we mentioned every par. we don’t take
there wouldn’t be any room for those we do take. . . .
J.Mc.D.: The Kaiser’s military number? Well, we’ve
had no recent information, but according to Revela-
tion xiii. it is six hundred three score and six....
Ignoramus: The idea seemed pretty clear —that a
nev light would come to the world through Belgium’s
Calvary. Anyhow, so far as Britain is concerned, it
becomes fairly clear that Germany is going to either
make or break it... .E.M.S.: Kind lady, forbear.
You have a good heart, but you can’t write verse....
E.J.C.: No use to this paper.... J. Alfred J.: Pre-
tentious r0t.... A.L.0.: Story not up... .G.F.C.:
Sorry. It can’t be done... .Chic: Yes. But it might
as well be twin saucepans for all the space the row
is worth... .C.F.8.: Original enough; but you could
hardly expect us to publish that.... Gosh: Take some
trouble with your lines. .. .Z.C.: “The Pedlar” falls
over his own bright feet at the end... .W.H.L. :
“Widow’s Son” is lamentable... .A.G.A.: Your
“Chant of Hate” foams all right; but what a tame
tag that “Drive them back” is after all the fleas and
bubonic rats. .. .M.P.: “Derelict” won’t do; but
there are some good lines in it....M.N.: “At Our
Hash House” is hopeless... .M.8.J.: No use....
J.H.A.: “My True Love” is built on a threadbare
idea and goes badly out of tune... .Bellerive: “Morn-
ing Scene at a Theatre” strikes us hardest: —
As an aspirant did shriek
Famed ever of thee,
The conductor struck up
Far o’er the sea.
While unable to suffer
Her wails of woe,
In horror the manager
Paced to and fro,
When a stage hand appeared
As a imp in a rage,
And seared the aspirant
From off the stage.
.... Garnet: P00r.... Old Volunteer: If hate can’t
inspire a better attempt it must be out of the wrong
bottle... .G.11.K.: Smart enough; but you have the
wrong end of the commentary of fools. .. .G.W.A.N.:
Too slight. .. .B. Sun: Not quite. .. .K. 8.: Lots worse
has been published; but there isn’t a new idea or
phrase in it... . Aisla: Keep on being good and your
single sin in verse may be forgiven... .J.M.P.:
Unpleasant sonnet strikes no new note.... J.E.: Sorry,
but not nearly up.... Rally: George Reid at his worst
would never think of such a thing... .Uloola: Cheer-
ful; hardly up. .. .W.G.8.: “Pinky’s Drink” couldn’t
raise a smile... .H.E.P.: Don’t, unless they are bet-
ter than the sample... .A.L.R.: Verse poor; ideas
onl/ middling. .. .E. 0.: Such good material should
give results; try again J.C.: Sentiments all
right; but said better before M.P.S.: Even a
lame leg can’t excuse such verses.. . .H.C.C.: It is
the bad points that matter to those who have to
read them. “A Sonnet” isn’t a sonnet and “A Kiss,”
a 3 you hint, is a poor business on paper....S.K.:
You describe well, but your people are not quite
alive... .S.G.: Evidently needed a course at the
lingerie counter as a tonic.... Buzzer: Verse doesn’t
g ei there. .. .R.M.H.: Nearly ; but lines too rough. ...
D. 11.: A parody of Omar must be something out of
the ordinary to get through W.K.: “Out where
the bull feeds” —don’t see any point in that. But
there ought to be a par. in the man somewhere. Try
again... .Torrid Zone: Can you produce definite cir-
cumstantial evidence that any society collecting goods
from the public is retailing them to the soldiers?
Good, honest evidence that you can look in the face
—not the sort that is always just round the next
corner? Shell: Yes. It fell in the trenches
X.Q.M.: One after the other—one, two, three
1.N.: No. O-u-t.
The Speck is getting an idea of the value
it receives for the borrowed money it spends
at present boom prices. The departmental
estimate supplied to Parliament for the build-
ing of 21 miles of light railway from Ulver-
stone to Nietta was £71,000. The actual
expenditure to date has been £98,200, and
the job is not finished yet. But they think they
may get through for £104,000, or say 50 per
cent, over what was reckoned a fair thing a
couple of years or so back. And every
penny of that extra cost is going to be a tax
on the producer—most likely a perpetual tax.
According to a report prepared by a com-
mittee of the War Council, the job of settling
soldiers on the land is going, if these people
have their way, to cost the nation somewhere
about £20,000,000. At any rate, the com-
mittee feels fairly confident that if the Com-
monwealth advances the States this amount,
something fairly comprehensive ctn be de-
vised. Of course, it would not be enough for
everything, so the body recommends that pub-
lic subscriptions be taken up to buv seed and
horses and food for the settlers. ' So it all
boils down to the lOU and the hat; and all
the while there are millions of acres of
unused land in the continent. What a re-
sourceful people we are!
“Playbird”: “S.T.S.” (B. 20/l/’l6)
wants to know the meaning of “barley” and
its origin. Among Victorian school kiddies,
of three generations at least, it has been a
cry for an armistice in all games of chasing,
such as “Bobbers and Police,” “Tiggy” and
“Hide’n’seek.” It comes from the French
parle, anglicised to “parley.” In the old
days of tilting, duelling and other popular
methods of sudden death, one of the com-
batants having had enough gore would call
for a parley—hence the kiddies’ “barley.”
So, while the language has changed com-
pletely since old Chaucer used it, this word
has been handed along by one generation of
nippers to the next. Another interesting
survival of the mediaeval minstrel ballads is
the games little girls love to play. These
have some action, but the chief attraction
is the heroic, chanting chorus that accom-
panies them. “Poor Alice is a Weeping” and
“Green Gravels” are a couple that come to
me this minute. They are well-made verses
in their way, and each contains a dramatic
romance.

Tke G~E Electric Way
rvr ELECTRIC
UL FLATIRON
riTT ELECTRIC
UE FAN
Do good, quick, clean Ironing.
You can iron in any room in the house —or on the porch—with a G-E
Electric Iron. Attach it to any light socket, turn the switch and the G-E
Iron is ready in a moment.
Aside from these conveniences, think of the time, money and steps a
G-E, Iron saves. Think of the lessened wear and tear on the family linen.
With a G=E Electric Iron you get “ Even Heat.”
EVEN HEAT
No Spot too Hot
No spot too hot; it is no hotter at the point than at the
heel —at the edges than in the centre. This safeguards
against scorches —makes the ironing go quicker and
easier; saves time, which means saving electricity; in
fact
An Average Family Ironing costs
only Threepence for Electricity.
Spc'daily-arranged air chambers in the G-E Iron hold
the heat down directly to the ironing surface. Using
the heat this way also permits you to do considerable
ironing with the electricity turned off.
The G-E trademark on this iron stands for quality—it assures you a
lifetime of satisfactory service.
Banish hot=weather Discomfort.
Turn the switch and command the faintest zephyr, or a sweepin*
breeze—as you please—and it shall be yours—in home, office, bedroom,
ballroom or workshop. A simple device places the speed entirely within
your control.
Twenty years of laboratory study and factory application are concen-
trated in the smooth-running, noiseless mechanism of the G-E Electric Fan.
Its Oscillating Motion,
silently stirring the air—like the breeze flow of nature —is only one of the
many practical features of this fan.
Its sturdiness of construction, the perfect integrity of its materials and
parts, its delicacy of balance throughout, which prevents vibration and wear,
all assure you a lifetime of satisfactory service.
As to Economy, sufficient to say that the G-E Fan, depending on the
size, can be run
Seven or Eight Hours for One Penny
—less than the cost of burning a single ordinary incandescent light.
G-E Fans are made in many sizes and styles for use in homes, stores,
offices, hotels, restaurants and factories. Any desired finish to match
surroundings may be ordered.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot he com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
rally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

IN BANANA LAND
There seems a chance of having something
done, anyhow. By the last ’Frisco maii-
steamer there descended on Australia a
Dr. Julia Seton, who has a new religion,
and guarantees it to put matters right.
There are no limits to Julia —she explains
that she has been inspired by the Light of
the World in science, philosophy and psy-
chology—and amongst the glad tidings the
lady brings from Chicago is the assurance of
someone having proved “that the vegetable
kingdom knows as much as humanity, and
if we curse a flower it will understand and
die.” Australia should have much use for
Julia, and this paper most earnestly invites
her to get aboard the train and hike away
to Bananaland. There she will find a vast
expanse of vegetable which has long been
vehemently cursed in decorative Australese,
but hasn’t shown the least sign of under-
standing. Instead of dying it insists on
being robustly healthy. Therefore if Julia
ascends to the top of a local anthill and
addresses a few words of suitable remon-
strance and emphatic curse to the pear, and
the calamitous vegetable shrivels up. the
whole land will call her blessed and fill her
handbags with gold. After an interval for
refreshment, could be turned on to
the national debt, the everlasting strike
and State Frights. But let her get at some-
thing easy like the pear till she feels
acclimatised.
“Regabel”: “Cleveland*’ raises the point
of Dr. Breinl, an Austrian, having the
house-surgeemship of the Townsville General
Hospital, and at the same tune drawing
£lOOO per annum for allowing himself to be
director of the Tropical Institute of Medi-
cine. Since then the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has showered more distinction on
Breinl, by appointing him quarantine
officer during the absence of Dr. Priestly,
Still, I don’t see what “Cleveland” has to
complain about, as at the time of the hospi-
tal appointment the only doctors, available
were Australians who spoke fairly good
English, and were thoughtless enough to
have qualified in Australia. Which natur-
ally damned their chances! There was also
Dr. King-Patrick, of the State Health
Department, who had come up to the rescue
of the Town Council during an epidemic of
typhoid. He might have been in the run-
ning, as he was imported; but his Scotch
descent was against him. So the foreigner
simply had to get the billet. Much the same
SLINGS AND ARROWS.
SHE: “To tell you the truth, I believe Guy only wants to marry me for my money.”
HE : “Poor fellow—I hadn't an idea he was so hard up.”
position arose in regard to the quarantine
appointment, excepting that it was com-
plicated by the fact that Priestly’s pre-
decessor, Dr. W. B. Nisbet, who had held
the post for many years, resigned rather
tlian hand over to Breinl whenever he (Nis-
bet) went on leave. Tow'nsville is now in
the unique position of having its oversea
shipping boarded by an Austrian who
hurriedly got naturalised a few weeks pre-
vious to the outbreak of war; and the
appointment was made just when Prime
Minister Billy Hughes was foaming about
.enemy shareholders. The time seems to have
nearly arrived to regard one or tw.o mem-
bers of this Government with the cold eye
of suspicion.
“Barcoo”: A few days ago George
Furness, of Maryborough, celebrated his
100th birthday. The production of his birth-
certificate at the jubilee spree allayed all
doubts as to the year of the gay old chap’s
birth, unless the man who made out the
document threw in a few years for luck.
Here’s a nice kettle of fish. In Septem-
ber, 1914, one Lily Baker obtained an order
against Charles Page, now under orders for
foreign service, for maintenance of her
little Jim. Page consented thereto, and
has made various payments. • But now the
woman, having married, has made an affi-
davit declaring that Page wasn't the child’s
father; and Page also went recently into
the witness-box and deposed that the other
yarn was all wrong and he w'as really inno-
cent of the responsibility. In any case,
Page’s counsel contends that the order was
inoperative, owing to Page's military lia-
bility to serve the King oversea, and could
hot be enforced. And the infant rubs his
eyes and wonders who pa really is.
“Billybunger”: What sort of yell will
cerne from the squattocracy of Queensland
when it realises that it has to provide bath-
rooms for its employees! Bathrooms t
Great Gohannas! The Workers’ Accommo-
dation Act, which came into force on Janu-
ary 1, provides, among other things, that
an employer of even one station or farm
hand must supply suitable sleeping and din-
ing quarters, as well as bathroom and out-
house. Not more than three men are
allowed to bunk in an apartment, which
must be large enough to allow each sleeper
480 cubic feet of air. The old Act, now
repealed, applied only to shearers and sugar
workers. The present Act embraces workers
on farms and cattle stations. The latter
places are notorious for the amount' of
accommodation they don’t provide, and, as
might be expected, the big companies are the
w r orst offenders. Tent accommodation on
portable shearing plants is made illegal.
Such accommodation is only allowed where
the station huts have been destroyed by fire
or some such unforeseen trouble has
occurred, and then for one season only.
Other clauses provide for suitable kitchens,
meat safes, fly-proof privies, etc. In the
matter of accommodation for bush workers
Queensland is half a century ahead of the
Ma State, and one of the chief factors of
success has been the appointment of in-
spectors independent of the police.
Pluto, who discovered the Plutoville field
and another of promise in North Queensland,
died at Coen lately, while in town getting
provisions. Pluto was a full-blooded Binglii
of unusual intelligence. It is said that one
mine he found lias produced over £20,000 to
date. This paper doesn t know how much
Pluto got out of it.
. Bennett, just appointed Principal
ot ! vin S s College, the Methody institution
affiliated with Queensland University, is a
Tasmanian, born near Hobart about 40 years
ago. At Melbourne he took his M.A., and
mopped up every possible honor in Philo-
sophy and Logic on the way. Next he
proceeded to decorate himself with the
degree of London University, about the
stiffest thing going in theological dis-
tinctions. _ Since then he has been
preaching in Launceston and Hobart.
i ls , something of an inkspiller,
and took part in launching The Austra-
lian Aation,. a paper which meant big
things but died after about two years’
struggle. Bennett is physically very ‘little,
but he can swallow learning as a lion swal-
lows meat.
Municipally Brisbane is one of lhe dead
cities of the earth. It is gripped so firmly
by the proputty-owner that no one else
bothers. Witness thereto that in the seven
seats this election there is only one contest
And while 'the Upper House exists there
will be no widening of the franchise to
alter matters.
The recent Brisbane Teachers’ Conference
again insisted on the restoration of the
sacred right of the dominie to whack the
big girl. By regulation Issued some few
years ago teachers must keep hands off girls
over 12. But the pedagoguesses of Banana-
land assert that this is just the time when
these maidens want correction— and they
ought to know, though it doesn’t follow that
they know best what to give it with.
“Politicus”: I see that Lord Mayor
Richard Deanis Meagher, of Sydney, hopes
shortly to put into operation a system of
rating on unimproved land values, and adds:
“Sydney will then be the first eapftal city
in Australia to supply this form of taxa-
tion. This is one of the landmarks I in-
tend to leave.” Unfortunately for the land-
meagherker there is a capital city called
Brisbane—to say nothing of non-capital
cities like Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton,
Toowoomba and Gympie—that has had taxa-
tion on unimproved land values for over 20
years. A certain Thomas Mcllwraith, at
the instance of M.L.A. Willie Stephens,
placed taxation on unimproved values in the
Local Government Act of his regime, an-
other instance of a profoundly radical change
having emanated from profoundly Conser-
vative sources.
The other day Finlayson. M.H.R., wrote
to Prime Minister Hughes and expressed the
view r that, in forcing out enemy shareholders,
some consideration should be shown to those
naturalised aliens who were known to have
behaved . themselves. Whereat Brisbane
Courier was flooded with letters, and the
paper opened a fund to be utilised for the
enlightenment of Finlayson. This seemed
good business for the Courier, afid
it already began to dream of winning
Finlayson’s seat from Labor at the
next tussle. But there was ill luck
in the w r ay, for during the same w’eek
special attention was drawn to tb# fact that
the Courier was still publishing a German
paper for its Teutonic subscribers who will
not learn English. In that very issue there
was the report of a German wedding, and
the paragraph announced that “the usual
toasts were proposed and responded to.” It
was also noticed that the German pastor
who officiated was of the same name as one
who that w r eek was interned for disloyal
utterances. Then followed the information
that the Federal Government had decided
to put a stop to all these German publica-
tions. So the Courier, wffiich laughed at
Finlayson, is now being laughed at, and the
guffaw can be heard at the Gulf.
“Itan”: Old man Adamson, the Minister
to the Railway Department, is the only
member of the Bananaland Government who
has shown any desire to go over and give
the Iluns a twist. But he has passed the
age and has to be content with a represen-
tative in his son. There is a good deal of
talk in Queensland about the fact that only
two members of the Assembly U’ve so far
put on khaki —Rankin and Tolmie. both
Tories. On the Labor side fully half are
under the age limit and some are so young
that an irate member of the Fossil Chamber
said the other day that they were “a lot
of boys and ought to be at school.” If he
had said a military school he w'ould have hit
the bull in the eye. Yet all these eligibles
hold aloof while the argument proceeds in
Europe, and the call to help others at the
Front sounds in the public ear, and the
local troops are chafing to get away to the
killing, and wounded returns walk the street,
and the news keeps coming from the War
Office that a great many more hands are
wanted. But honorable members are con-
tent to enjoy their feather beds. They are
nor shamed or disturbed by the example of
Old man Adamson, nor moved by his decla-
ration that he would rather see a son of
his a dead soldier than a live shirker. But
they shall have their reward. When they
come on the next hustings to receive re-
newed confidence they shall have instead
the dead rat of scorn cast at their mouths
by hands that have found cunning in throw-
ing grenades.
Ye Ballade of Ye Happye Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Balkans are ruddy with blood,
The Dwina is swollen and red,
The Vistula’s banks are a-flood
With corpses and choked with her dead;
Afar on the borders of France
Germania commences to reel
And quake at her foemen’s advance —•
But Tirpitz is happy at Kiel!
His countrymen die in the trench
By thousands in sunny Champagne;
A line to the mother or wench,
And back to the bullets again ;
Back, back to the poisonous shell,
The gas and the bomb and the steel,
The wounds and the fevers of Hell-
While Tirpitz is happy at Kiel!
The Russian may fight for his bogs.
The Turk for his Dardanelle ditch,
The Bulgars may perish like dogs—
Their outlook is blacker than pitch;
Away in the seas of the North
Stout Jellicoe’s squadrons may wheel;
But why should his fleet sally forth
When Tirpitz is happy at Kiel?
The earth may be riven with strife.
Her valleys be blackened with fire,
Her crucifix change to a knife.
Her churches be turned to a byre;
Her butchers may bury their slain
In scorn where the saints used to kneel.
But —Peace to this chanty of Pain —
Von Tirpitz is happy at Kiel.
So lift him a statue so high,
And stud it with brass-headed nails,
A telescope screwed in his eye.
A cushion glued on to his tails;
.Inscribe on that monument’s base,
Admire him, ye Teutons so leal;
No matter who trod on your face
Old Tirpitz kept happy at Kiel!

THE FOUR,
£350
they’re here!
And in all America or Europe you’ll not find a
single car anywhere near the price of this new
Studebaker 5-passenger, 4-cvlinder Touring Car
that offers anywhere near so great a value.
You CAN pay more, yes ; but you can’t BUY a car that will give you
any more service, any more durability, greater dependability or greater
safety. And on points of beautiful lines and handsome finish, as well as
the more practical considerations of performance, this car will stand
comparison with the most expensive, either on the finest boulevard or
the roughest roads and steepest hills.
It is one of the handsomest cars you ever laid your eyes on. It is easy riding, very comfortable,
of highest quality mechanism throughout, and very economical.
Words alone cannot do justice to the car —but, if you will let us, we will put this new Studebaker
“FOUR” through its paces for you, and that will be the most satisfactory way for you to find out
whether it is the best car value at anywhere near its price. Or, if you cannot call, we will gladly
mail you illustrated descriptive matter.

“Mil” : Melbourne Age in one of its rare
“literary” spasms:—
Others of lower cultural status devour wholesale
the myriad American books, carefully puffed in not
disinterested critical journals, anil written for
dollars by semi-literate adventurers.
At least the worst of the second-rate
American books are immeasurably bet-
ter _ than the tripe of Hall Caine.
Marie Corelli and Charles Garbage, and
the high literary standard of England
has given these rot-merchants big money.
The “myriad American books written for
dollars by semi-literate adventurers” would
not be so largely read in Australia if the
Age and other Australian dailies had spent
a few dollars in paying Australian writers
for better stuff, and so encouraging the
Australian book-publisher to follow. But
the Protectionist Age believes in freetrade
ia tripe, so it can buy the rights of a
foreign serial for a tenner —anything from
50 to 80 columns in length. The Austral-
asian, too, stars a cheap serial by a sub-
mediocrity like Katherine Tynan and dis-
misses better stuff in the same issue as
“the wgrk of local writers.” And of such
is the Kingdom of the oof-hunting Aus-
tralian daily !
“C.G.” : Here’s a point that may be use-
ful. My premises being invaded by strong
sewage gases, I requisitioned the services of
a plumber. He after careful examination
said everything was all right with the sys-
tem. I said “German spy” and engaged a
builder. He got on to the trouble in the
ventilating shaft. It was thoroughly choked
with an immense wad of past and present
sparrows’ nests. Now when your home
smells like a tote commission you’ll know
what to do about it.
(_risto” on the luck of mines and miners:
Some time ago The Bulletin announced the re-
opening of the Badera lead mine in Northampton
(W.A.) by the Fremantle Smelter Co. I notice by
a recent issue of the British Australasian that the
same co. intends resuming at the Narra-Tarra, which
closed down seven years ago after 12 months’ work-
ing. Previous to that it had been idle for 40 years.
Eight years ago the Fremantle Co., actuated bv the
high price of lead, obtained a lease over the mine
and speculated about £4OOO on a new plant. Sink-
ing a new shaft about 100 ft. south of the old work-
ings a rich lode was struck running north and south.
Everything was going well, lead pouring out, money
pouring in, especially to the pub three miles away,
when sudden disaster overtook them. One of the
miners working in the north drive broke into the
old workings, which were filled with water, and
the inrush carried him out to the shaft —a distance
of 24ft., whence he was hauled out more dead than
alive. A miner in the south drive was drowned. By
primitive methods the workings were baled out in
three days, and the body of the drowned miner was
found right at the entrance to the drive, in a stand-
ing position. Evidently he had walked out through
the water, but in groping along had got his arm
caught between a beam and the roof of the drive,
and he had been held there till the water, gradually
creeping up, had drowned him.
The Commonwealth wheat scheme leaves
Tasmania out, and the local millers are
buying new season’s grain straight out
from the farmers in the usual way at 4s. 6d.
per bushel. Some of the farmers, noticing
that the mainland price is ss. Gd. or more
f.0.b., and ss. 2d. or thereabouts for wheat
supplied to millers, are getting restive and
want a wheat board. But others reckon a
bird in the hand is worth two, in the bush,
and would rather take 4s. 6d. cash on deliv-
ery than get 2s. (id. per bushel by certificate
now and wait till next year or sometime
for an indefinite balance.
“Jat^ues”: When this war is over some
means of preventing riots amongst women in
the scramble for the few men remaining will
have to be devised. I foresee something like
this in the papers —-
Along the Servian trail of -death,
The track to Monastir,
Ten thousand hungry corpses lie,
And mark the Huns’ career.
A Melbourne crowd of ' stay-at-homes
Takes vengeance swift and just;

And kicks his cakes to dust.
WEDDINGS.
At the Wedding Court this morning before the
Judge in Matrimony, Edyth Tessy Downey, 20, peti-
tioned for a rule calling on John Kitchener Molloy,
23, to marry her for five years, with the option of a
renewal for a further five years, on the ground that
he had shown affection for her, which affection she
reciprocated.
Evidence was given by George Edward Knowt that
he had often noticed the couple at Coogee, Manly
and other seaside resorts, and had once seen them
kissing.
In reply to Mrs. Bathtub, who appeared for the
petitioner, Mary Ann Watson swore that she had not
been to La Perouse with the respondent; she had
never kissed him in her life ; and as far as she knew
he loved the petitioner. She also denied having been
to the theatre with Molloy and also denied having
a conversation with him outside the court that morn-
ing.
Other witnesses were examined, and after perusing
the Vaccination and Medical Certificates of both
parties her Honor pronounced them man and wife
for a period of five years, with the right to have not
less than four children. The question of renewal was
ordered to stand over pending certain inquiries from
the Government 'Statistician.
Tom Haynes, who runs the immense
chemical-fertiliser department of the Mount
Lyell Co. in Melbourne, has a bee buzzing
in his bonnet. After considering the various
suggestions made for settling returned sol-
diers on the land, and noting that a confer-
ence is to be held “at an early date” in
Melbourne, Thomas has uttered a few words
on the subject. “All schemes so far have
been without a practical basis,” he roars.
‘ \V hat we want now is the working capital
and the land. Will not some of our well-to-
do squatters and farmers come forward to
form a syndicate with a capital of £lO.OOO
and a block of 1000 acres of land—money
and land to bear no interest for five years,
and the value to-day to be the basis of the
soldiers’ purchases five years hence?” The
Haynes plan is that, if there is any loss of
capital the squatter will bear it. and if the
soldier succeeds as a farmer he will be able
to become a freeholder on the strength of
his success. It is a rough-and-ready pro-
position, and won’t go far; but every little
will help, and there should be enough squat-
ters in the State to take the sporting risk—
if they are as patriotic as the Argus says.

In moving- the adoption of the Report the Chairman, Mr. George J. Cohen,
I am pleased to say that our operations for the past six months have be
The following resolutions were carried unanimously:—
“That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated
among the Proprietors.”
“That the Honorable Sir Thomas Hughes, M.L.C., be elected a Director of the Bank.”
“That the thanks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers
of the Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of the institution.”
H. H. MASSIE, General Manager.
..., said : —•
t am pleaseci to say tnat our operations ior me past six mourns nave been of a very satisfactory
character, and I think you will agree with me that the Report and Balance-sheet now before you bear
this out. ,
Following our usual custom, T will shortly compare the principal features of the Balance-sheet with
those of 12 months ago. first pointing out that the total figures have increased by £2,267,000.
On the debit side our Reserve Fund has been strengthened by transfers from our Profits to the extent
of £50,000, and with the further appropriation recommended by the Directors to-day that Fund will
stand at £1,805,000. . . . ,
Our deposits during' the period under review have increased by £2,293,000. Large increases in the
Government Balances account for a considerable portion of this, and, as mentioned by me at our last
Meeting, there appears to be an inclination on the part of many of our customers to let funds remain idle
pending favorable opportunities for investment.
Profit and Loss account shows better by £5OOO.
Notes in Circulation are less by £2778 through payment of notes that have, come in, the balance
ort:f "' ,; ng no'v P 1Y966. im
RilD in Circulation, alwavs a fluctuating item, aie do'n l y ?18 000. .
Turning to the credit side, let me point out t'-at our coin and c; r, ”■ ”ik<•-«•. V ‘-'i- • -:i. Com— r-,.
wealth legal tender notes, and bills and notes of other Banks, together exceed t..e figures of last year by
£4,119,833. ~ . . , , ~
Our coiu is less by £916,000. due to the same causes as mentioned in my last adores,.
British War Loan and other Stocks show an increase of £42,800.
The item N.S.W. Government £900.000 has disappeared, the amount having been repaid. _ .
Of the other items forming our liquid assets, Money at short call in London, and Bills receivable in
London and remittances in transit are less respectively by £118,562 and £76,562.
Our liquid assets with these variations show an increase for the period of £3,067,510, and tneir
total amount bears a ratio of £57 19s. Id. %to our liabilities to the Public.
Our advances during the period under review are less bv £BOB,OOO, due to the more speedv realisation
this season of wool and other products, and to the contraction of business requirements generally owing to
tll<? Bank Premises account lias increased by £B6OO and now stands at £585,343.
This is the third Balance-sheet issued since the beginning of Hie war, and, although there has
naturally been a considerable contraction in business operations, the Banks earning power has been well
maintained During the period referred to we have been able to pay our usual dividend, with the present
• ppronriation recommended, place £75,000 to the Reserve Fund, and pay our Officers a bonus each
ha f-year Never was there a time when the bonus paid to the Staff was more thoroughly deserved
in view of the heavv extra work entailed on those carrying on the business of the Bank in the absence of
manv of their fellow officers at the Front. I am sure you will be pleased that we have been able to
regularly pav it. Those Officers who are absent on active service also receive credit for it.
Twelve months ago I said that it was our policy to keep theßank in a strong position Our propor-
tion of liquid as-'ets to our liabilities to the public was then 50%. It is now as I have told you a shade
under 58%. This indicates that our policy has been adhered to,, as we have actually strengthened our
position without impairing the earning power of the Bank. It is our intention to continue our po icy

It may not bo out of place for me before closing my remarks to call attention to the urgent necessity:
that ex sts for strict economy on the part of evervone, including the Governments. Very great financial
saerifires may vet have to be made before the termination of the war. and it behoves us all therefore to
husband our resources that we may be able to assist the Federal Government to find the money, which is
as necessary as men, to bring the war to a successful conclusion.

UNREFRESHING SLEEP
The woman- who feels tired out, who aches
all over when she rises in the morning, who
feels depressed most of her time, needs just
the help that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills can
give her —new blood and stronger nerves.
The number of disorders that are caused
by thin blood is amazing, and most women,
are careless about the condition of their
blood. Their nerves are quickly affected, and
they become irritable ; they worry over trifles
and they do not obtain refreshing sleep.
There may or may not be stomach trouble
and headaches. This is. the condition that
calls for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, the blood-
making and nerve-restoring tonic.
Give Dr. Williams' Pink Pills a trial, and
the first sign of new life will soon lie noticed
by your increased appetite. You will be
hungry by meal-time. As your blood becomes
enriched it feeds and soothes the irritated
nerves, sleep becomes sounder and refresh-
ing, your worries diminish, and your work
seems lighter. These are some of the benefits
that follow the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. Try them for any trouble caused by
thin blood, and begin to-day.
Any dealer can supply Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. — Advt.
TO CORRECT CONSTIPATION.
Constipation is usually accompanied by
indigestion, either as the cause or as a result.
In correcting constipation it is very import-
ant to restore the stomach, intestines and
other digestive organs to a healthful con-
dition.
It is here that Pinkettes, the new laxa-
tive. have an exceptional value. One of these
little pink granules taken after the principal
meal each day will promote digestion and
stimulate the appetite. Pinkettes clear away
waste material, prevent congestion, and with
a little persistence really correct constipa-
tion.
Write to-day to the Dr. Williams’ .Medi-
cine Co., Sydney, mentioning The Bulletin,
for a free sample of Pinkettes. or get a full-
sized Is. bottle from your chemist. — Advt.

Rubbed Until Quite Sore, Used
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Oint-
ment, Now Completely Cured,
Karitanc, Prospect Station, Via Sale, Vic.
—"Almost from his birth our baby had sev-
eral patches of eczema on the back of his
head which grew as he grew until at last tho
patches of eczema were about three inches
long and about two inches wide. These gave
baby a terrible lot of worry; he used to rub
and rub his head on the pillow until his head
got quite sore.
"We saw an advertisement for Cuticura
Remedies and sent for samples of the Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. The result has
been simply marvelous. We then purchased
some more and in quito a short time baby’s
head had lost all traces of tho horrible ec-
zema. Ho is now completely cured.”

BOOTS are the smart wear for the season
—Dame Fashion has cast that die most
decisively—-ard this white poplin boot,
fashionable',’ short-fronted, with a trim,
military heel, will look uncommonly well with
the short white skirts of this season. Then,
better still, like all the short-fronted models
in the Bostock range, it is quite amazingly
comfortable, and will suit all types of feet. In
fact, most women will get a pleasant surprise
when they try it on, and see how nice it looks
and how delightful it feels. . And it will con-
tinue to feel delightful in wear, since all
Bostock soles are specially treated so as to
extract from them those chemicals used in
tanning, which are apt to make the feet hot
and tired. So, in this boot one will be
dainty, cool and fresh, able to enjoy walks,
picnics and excursions in the most blazing
weather.

The Inky Way.
“Westralian’s” tales of the Censorship:—-
Tor rearers shrouded from t’io- lay mind by the
husk of mystery, the Censor, deputy-Censor, even the
assistant-deputy sub-Censor, must wear, or have
worn, a suit with buttons of metal, leather belts,
swords and things. Active and efficient men are
needed for sterner duties, so the Defence Dept, turns
back to the old days when the volunteer officers were
clad as the macaw and the private as the parrakeet.
Ancient militia colonels, captains and such are
brought from their grain-stores, ironmongeries, etc.,
to place heavy and unintelligent thumbs upon the
news service of the papers, the cable portion of
which has already run the gauntlet of the London
official.
Some of the efforts of the Deputy Censors have
been brightly humorous. In one city, in the earlier
days of the war, a captain, aware that papers must
not mention the movements of troopships, mutilated
a shipping wire which announced the departure from
Sydney of the steamer Canadian Transport. “Lloyd’s
Register” would have shown him that she was a
harmless unit of the Transport line. After this
captain’s culminating achievement as a censor a
humorless authority transferred him to a post in the
Intelligence Department!
One holder of a deputy’s job, an eminently re-
spectable old gentleman, wears behind his name the
letters V.D., which stand for Very Deficient. He
has earned the title. Some months before the news
of a certain incident was released the papers
were warned that no mention could be made
of that incident. The conscientious V.D. took
his instructions from headquarters so liter-
ally that every paper received his warning circu-
lar. Such publications as the “Turf Club Calendar”
(which notifies disqualifications, changes of horse-
ownership, color registrations, etc.), the Education
Gazette, and the Hen were all solemnly enjoined to
preserve a dark reticence about the affair. A warn-
ing finger was even held up to the Government
Gazette.
* * * *
“Musketoon” : Up at Tottenham, which is
somewhere over against Forbes (N.S.W.),
a local editor bares his inmost soul to all the
world. Thus a recent issue: “There will be
no issue of the Peer next week as the pro-
prietor intends putting in a few days rabbit-
catching in order to make a few bob to start
the New Year.”
“The Nomad” : Les Buchanan, editor of
the Darling Downs Gazette, wants to find
out if the bayonet in Europe is mightier
than the pen at Toowoomba, and in order
to make sure of getting a scoop is going
out after the news himself.
* * * #
“Wilmot K.”: “S.T.S.” (B. 20/1/TG) is
correct in his surmise as to the
meaning of “barley.” The word is
used by Scottish children when play-
ing chasing games, and provides for a
breathing time or truce, during which the
person being chased cannot be “touched.”
The word appears to be a corruption of
“parley.”
“0.K.”: The humorless cable syndicate
last week sent a description of a sensational
cartoon in London Paunch,. “It pictures
George Reid riding a kangaroo and enter-
ing the House of Commons with So-and-so
holding the reins and members in the back-
ground cheering. The letterpress suggests
that the Speaker welcomes the new member
with the words ‘Advance Australia.’” What
a subtle suggestion! Last time I heard Reid
talk of black-and-white art was when he
opened Will Dyson’s exhibition of carica-
tures in Melbourne. Then he spoke about
the wondrous working of the human mind.
The old subject of so many cartoons must
have wondered what sort of human mind
was needed to work out the “Advance Aus-
tralia” picture. George on a kangaroo. Mr.
Speaker greeting him, and “members in the
background cheering”—ye gods ! England’s
representative comic paper fully explains
Bull’s unimaginative tactics in the war!
It is easy to foresee what will happen when
the Avar ends. Paunch will produce a pic-
ture of a commonplace colleen marked “Miss
Tipperary” holding an olive branch and
shaking hands with the typical bhroth of. a
bhoy in knee breeches and a soldier’s tunic.
The letterpress will say: “Begorra, it .was
a long, long way to git to you, me darlint.”
Can’t you see that picture coming?
“J.F.11.” concerning a London paper which,
after being hung up for a month, has. been
allowed to climb down and appear again:—
The suppression of the Globe, our oldest evening
paper, is the sensation of the moment on the inky
way. Charles Palmer, its editor, has been one of
the most strenuous critics of the Government’s con-
duct of the war. He has gone to the danger-line
several times, but he overstepped it in the matter of
Kitchener’s alleged resignation. Not only was he the
first to proclaim the resignation as an actual fact, but
next day he repeated the statement with added
emphasis after it had been officially contradicted by
the Government, anti with cheeky recklessness posted
a flaming placard at every street corner bearing the
words: “Lord Kitchener. The Globe Re-asserts.”
The Government couldn’t stand that, so a big body
of police took possession of the office, stopped the
printing of the paper, dismantled the machinery, and
carried off cartloads of copies. Started about the
beginning of the nineteenth century, the Globe axd
Traveller (its full title) had been coming’ out every
day for 112 years until this unpleasant break in the
continuity. It has always had clever Irishmen in
its editorial department, and at one time had a
famous Irish literary priest, Father Frank Mahony
(“Father Prout”), as part-proprietor and copious
contributor. The Irish-Australian J. F. Hogan started
his London journalistic career in its columns, and
for some time wrote the daily Parliamentary sketch
from the press gallery before he took his place on
the floor. Young Disraeli, the Lord Beaeonsfield and
Prime Minister of the future, had a lively scrap 80
years ago with the then editor. Dizzy had published
a pretentious “Vindication of the English Constitu-
tion,” which was mercilessly scarified by the Globe.
’the ambitious young Jew brought all his power of
vituperation to bear upon the editor, whom he
characterised as “a craven dullard, a miserable pol-
troon, a literary scarecrow, a mere thing stuffed
with straw and rubbish.” Also he publicly boasted
that he had “tweaked the editor of the Globe by the
nose, inflicted sundry kicks upon the baser part of
his base body, and made him eat his own words
fouler than any filth.” Controversial mud-slinging
was quite a fine art in those day’s. lhus Dan
O'Connell at this same time genially referred to
young Disraeli as “a lineal descendant of the impeni-
tent thief who died upon the Cross.”

Remarßable
Discovery for
GREY HAIR
Mrs. Mary Chapman Restores Her Hair to its Original Color
after Having been completely Grey for Eight Years.
A Simple, Harmless Method, which can be used in
own home WITH COMPLETE SUCCESS.
UNSOLICITED TESTIMONY.
Sheep Hills, Vic.
Dear Madam, —Having received your letter 1
ordered one large bottle of your “Genuine
Specific,” which I received safely some time
ago, and am well satisfied with it, thanking
you for the trouble of writing again.—l am,
yours respectfully, N.D.
Wiseman’s Ferry, Hawkesbury River.
To Mrs. Mary K. Chapman.
Dear Madam, —It would be more than
remiss of me not io write to you and tell you
how much pleased and astonished I am at the
efficacy and effectiveness of your “Genuine
Specific” for grey hair. It is nothing short of
a marvellous scientific discovery. No one need
now have grey hair unless they want to have
it. I was greatly struck with the manner
your pamphlet was written. There was a
veri-simile air about it which impressed me.
I do not care to have my name appear in
your advertisement, but you can refer anyone
to me privately. I am very well known in this
colony, and naturally do not wish to set it on
the housetop that I used a hair-color restorer,
etc.
It is indeed remarkable that you apply a
liquid a"® clear as spring water to to
bone, to your skin, without any result, and
that the cork in the bottle can remain for
weeks in contact with the liquid without being
discolored, the only thing it seems to effect is
HAIR. Wishing you all the success which
the discovery is worthy of.
—I remain, Revd. J.F.M., B.A.

Mrs. Mary Chapman. Bose Bay.
Bear Madam, —I have used one small bott'3
of j our Hair Specific, and I am highly pleased
with it; nearly all my grey hairs have disap-
peared.
My hair has returned to its color of youth-
ful days. It is simply marvellous the effect
your specific has had on it. I never expected
to get anything half so good. I never intend
to have grey hairs while I can get your
epeciflc. Why should I? It is so clean, too;
does not stain the skin nor the clothing. Send
me another bottle now, so that I can keep it
right by an occasional application. You can
“sethis letter if you wish, but not the name.
Send bottle by return, cheque enclosed.
—Yours faithfully,

Mrs. Mary K. Chapman.
Bear Madam, —Vour letter received yester-
ay greatly surprised me on first sight, but
now condude that my order for large bottle
which I duly received and acknowledged by
return mail has been overlooked by you—also
a ter three weeks’ application I wrote you
stating that I was well pleased with results
attained by using your “Genuine Specific.”
f ani s t‘H using the remedy occasionally, and
ha\e not got through the supply yet.
I consider, myself fortunate in procuring
your Specific in my only attempt to get rid
° Srej hair, without wasting time, etc., on
other remedies. Rest assured that I will
always advise the use of your “Genuine
Specific, —lours gratefully, J.J.E.
I, who was once Grey Haired, and belong to a prematurely grey-haired
family, address the readers of this paper, in particular persons who have
tried sundry widely-advised preparations for Grey Hair and have been
disappointed with the results. I do not wish to criticise these remedies,
but users of my preparation have the firm assurance that IT WILL DO
WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO. The color-creating cells of the hair, which
have hitherto been dormant, become revitalised under the influence of my
Specific, and they commence to produce fresh pigment and the same shade
as in earlier years. The change comes about GRADUALLY, SURELY
and ISTATURALLY; the improvement is remarkable. After a few days’
application the hair becomes richer in color, and the transformation
increases in strength and intensity until the hair is once again THE
SHADE OF YOUTH. Six weeks’ treatment changed my appearance
from that of a prematurely-aged Avoman, and gave me back the hair of
my girlish days, to the astonishment of myself and the surprise of my
friends. Since I have introduced my preparation to public notice numer-
ous people of both sexes and of all classes, who I only know through my
extensive correspondence, have written to me acknowledging the same
MARVELLOUS EFFICACY of this formula, which they say is unlike
anything they have hitherto tried. It was through my own greyness that I
came into possession of this wonderful remedy, the fruit of the work of a
Scientist who had made the CHEMISTRY OF THE HAIR the favorite
hobby study (not for money-making motives) of his leisure hours, and
amidst the Legions of Grey Hair Preparations it is the one genuine pre-
scription that RESTORES THE COLOR BY A NATURAL PROCESS.
Many, in fact the great majority, of Grey Hair preparations eventually ruin
the hair, but my remedy is ABSOLUTELY HARMLESS, and will help
develop a strong and beautiful growth of hair.

REXONA-the Surfer’s Friend
To all lovers of outdoor sport a dip in tlie roaring breakers on a summer’s
day is indeed romance. Next day the sunburnt, blistered hands and scarlet face
are painful realities. This distress can be avoided by the application of soothing,
cooling, healing Rexona to the face, hands and arms. First bathe the face, hands
and arms with Rexona Soap and tepid water, softly drying them, then apply
Rexona gently to the skin. If this is done there will be no after-effects from the
exposure to the sun. No regrets
after a happy day. Rexona Soap
and Rexona in its dainty pot
should stand on the toilet table of
all who indulge in outdoor sports.
Try the Rexona
Remedies.
To minimise the
after-effects of Sun-
burn, anointing with
Rexona, the Rapid
Healer, is all that is
necessary, and the skin
soothed and cooled
by its wonderful influ-
ence will quickly regain its
normal temperature and com-
fortable coolness. Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap will be found
excellent in combination with
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and
unequalled for all skin
troubles, asd as a shampoo for
the hair after your dip.

INTERESTING SELECTIONS FROM THE WORLD’S SMARTEST BEAUTY ARTICLES.
SIMPLE RECIPES MOST EFFECTIVE.
How to Discard an
Unsightly Complexion.
“Toilet Club Notes.’’
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “If I
could only tear off this old skin!” and, do
you know, it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would he too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually —requiring about
ten days to complete the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth.
vellous! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surely discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mercolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
Have Grey Hair?
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless recipe
will correct it.
people know that grey hair is not a
neiJessarv feature of age—that it can be
avo'ided 'without resorting to hair dyes. A
very o-ld, home-made remedy will t urn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
an ounce of concentrate of tammalite and mix
it with four ounces of bay rum. Apply this
simple lotion to the hair for a few nights with
a small sponge, and you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A Strange Shampoo.
“Cosy Coiner Chats.”
* * * i was much interested to learn from
this young woman with the beautiful glossy
hair that she never washes it with soap or
artificial shampoo powders. Instead she
makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspooni'ul of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only in
lib. sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it.
Certainly this little lady’s hair did look won-
derful even if she has strange ideas ot a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment gives instant
relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the skin.
You have onlv to drop a tablet of stymol,
obtained from the chemist’s, into a glass ot
hot water and bathe the face with the hquid
after the effervescence has subsided. lhe
blackheads will then come right off on the
towel. The enlarged pores immediately con-
tract to normal and the greasiness disap-
pears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool
and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent, it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Is Powder Necessary?
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically, No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at the same time both
effective and beneficial to the complexion.
Cleminite is a splendid substitute for face
powder which is at the bottom of many
complexion troubles. Get about an ounce
from the chemist’s and dissolve in four table-
spoonsful of water. The result is a fine clear
liquid, which instantly gives the face, neck or
arms that peach-like bloom of perfect health.
There is nothing to equal it for greasy skins,
and the result lasts all day long under the
most trying conditions. [4

The First Child.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE’S better now; all trouble’s o’er—
You see how sweet he smiled.
Hush! Wrap him up, and close the
door.
Oh, he’s a bonny child !
And you, my girl, are happy here
With friends to help you on ;
Y oU ’re in the springtime o’ the year—
My days are nearly gone.
But now you’ve settled, safely wed,
My sons are doing well;
I'll be content to rest my head,
I think I’ve earned a spell.
You’ll take my place.... And that is life.
Hush! Sound he’s sleeping. Hush!
When I was made your father’s wife,
Our home was in the bush.
How can I tell what memories
In that deep forest lie!
Often I see those mountain trees
That seem to touch the sky.
I loved to hear the axes ring
Across the forest wide,
And watch the teams o’ bullocks swing
Along the mountain side.
I baked the bread. And to our tent
The splitters would come down.
Then Peter had an accident
And had to go to towm.
They took him to the hospital,
And I was full o’ care,
And feared the trees, and stars, and all —-
The only woman there.
But every night, when work was done,
An old man had his smoke,
And told me, at the set o’ sun,
Of wild sea-faring folk,
And foreign parts, and palms and pearls
He’d seen, a sailor-man,
And dragon-ponds, and singing girls,
In China and Japan.
I never learned to read or write;
But eight miles every week
I’d walk for letters that at night
He’d read I couldn’t speak.
One time no letter came. Ah me!
I fainted on the track;
Then struggled on in misery,
Nor knew how I got back.
The old man saw my tears and sighs.
“You’re bad—l’ll bring a nurse,”
He said, “an old bushwoman wise.”
My pangs were growing worse.
She came at last, and I was glad
To hear a woman’s tone ;
But Peter was away... .It’s sad
To bear such joy alone.
I called my husband to the bed.
In vain. At break o’ mom,
When birds were singing overhead,
The little mite was born.
And all for this —the doom of birth,
Bud never came to flower;
She never saw the sky or earth,
She only lived an hour.
One hour of life. The splitters came,
When blossoms tempt the bees ;
She lies without a stone or name,
Beneath the forest trees.
And that was forty years and more.
He came, the eamp broke up;
The old man’s dead. We’ve labored sore
To win our bite and sup.
And I’ve had seven children since.
I must forget, you’ll say,
My first-born child. No words convince—
It’s just the same to-day.
And she’s as dear as all the rest —
It is a foolish tale —
As when she rocked upon my breast
There, in the morning pale.
And though I hardly saw T her face,
And though I’ll never find
In that thick bush her little place,
I often call to mind
The big trees where the magpies sing,
And mountain storm-clouds rush,
And think of her, poor little thing,
Lone, in the lonely bush....
But here comes Peter. There’s the child —-
His cot is snug and trim!
Look, man, how big he is. and wild ;
You must be proud of him!

Cats.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IDO not intend to talk about Wilhelmina,
or perhaps I should say Ferguson, our
pure white cat. She was named W il-
helmina when a kitten, but when she grew
up the prettiest tom-cat you ever saw she
was renamed Ferguson—just as a matter of
form, for he is still called Wilhelmina except
on special occasions. Nor will this be the
biography of Grey Shadow, the lady-cat
who, springing from nowhere, came to the
back door, saw us, and on the spot got the
idea into her half-starved nut that we be-
longed to her, and acted accordingly. She
has now a promising young son, the only
survival of multitudinous families. The
young fellow, too, is beginning to suspect
that we belong to him as well, but bis semi-
savage mind and heart are not quite made
up on the matter. Knowing what I do of
them all it would be indelicate to write the
biography of Wilhelmina or Grey Shadow,
to say nothing of Son, before they have
become that fairly common garbage, dead
cat
There are enough cats that are History,
so to speak, without working up the partial
life-cycle of living cats. Some of these long-
gone felines are mere memories rather than
actual history. Such are the two three-
weeks-old kittens that died piteously in the
doldrums in the Atlantic —died overgorged
with raw shark-meat. To complete the fam-
lly tragedy the mother was licked overboard
off Kerguelen by the top of the crest of one
of the monstrous following-seas that chased
the ship when running the easting clown in
a snowstorm. The innocent children never
knew their father—he lived somewhere on
a New York wharf, and did not follow the
sea. He knew better. Happily, they
passed out before they were old enough to
realise their mother’s morals.
The cats I have known were adventurers,
even as I, and died adventurers’ deaths. One
consolation they had : they travelled and saw
life.
I see it now mentally as I saw it actually
years ago : the overflow population of mys-
terious Cathay, living happily on the house-
boats moiling around us on the swift ebb
of the Yang-tse-kiang. The baby with a
string around its waist tethered amidships
to keep him from a premature end in the
river. The cat, for a less obvious purpose,
similarly moored, and the rest of the family
industriously sweeping, with impromptu
trawls, the bottom of the thick, yellow river,
for bits of overboard-fallen Australian coal.
And the ship full of rats. When the vermin
ate the heads and legs of the tortoises I had
purchased from a smiling Chinese dame (the
pointed snouts of the rodents easily fol-
lowed the extremities of the tortoises and
ate them out of the hollow they fondly
imagined would protect them), and finished
off with a shoehorn from South Shields, I
felt the time had come for drastic action.
On that drizzling Sunday morning Providence
ordained that a house-boat should defy the
standing order to keep from off the ship’s
side. One, as I stepped to the rail and
glanced down, had moored alongside. Why
I never knew, though some of the chaps no
doubt could tell if they cared to.
On the deck, riding to a ’midship mooring,
looking misanthropic enough, sat a lean,
hungry-looking, light-ginger-colored cat,
slowly licking off the moisture that trickled
into his whiskers. The kind of cat that
wculd think his fortune made if let loose
among a menagerie of rats such as we car-
ried. There was the kid, too, tethered under
an old umbrella, and not minding in the
least. The physical condition of that cat
conjured up possibilities. Picking up a
large lump of coal from under the staging
abreast of the main hatch, I held it out for
inspection over the heads of the master and
missus of the houseboat. Then I rested the
lump on the rail, and by help of a variation
on the deaf and dumb language informed
them that I was prepared to trade the lump
of coal for the cat. An expression of in-
credulous joy lit up their faces. Using the
same language, which they spoke as w r ell as
I did, they asked if it was a fair-dinkum
proposition. It was; and the cat’s moorings
were cast off.
.Jove, but that ginger cat could fight! Yet
I landed him on deck, where he stood as if
paralysed for a minute or so. Then he
threw a horrified look around and saw noth-
ing but white faces and clothes such as he
had never imagined existed.
When one of the seamen dropped on his
haunches, held out one hand and made
motions with the thumb and two fingers,
and said, compassionately, “Puss, poor
pussy,” the ginger one with electrical rapi-
dity slewed around. There was just a flash
going in through the cabin door and an
exclamation of grief and rage from a
startled steward coming out. Then I stooped
for another lump of coal, and signed that
I wished to swap it for the kid. Wide-eyed
and pale with horror the woman caught up
and strained the child to her bosom, amid
ribald shrieks from the crowd of sailors
lining the rail. The poor lady knew that
the White Devils wanted her baby for their
Sunday dinner.
That cat had no confidence in white
people. He was rarely seen, and then only
as a streak, going as if he had wings. For
a few days he disappeared. He was dis-
covered. accidentally, in the lazarette, where
he had. also accidentally, been locked in.
Sitting on a cask of beef he looked much .
hungrier than before, and more dispirited
than I have ever seen any other cat look.
He must have been pretty far gone, for
though he shrank away a little he let me
stroke him. He partook, in some haste and
in big mouthfuls, of a generous helping of
meat and condensed milk —he could be seen -
swelling. Then he licked his whiskers,
looked around casually, saw me and hqgthsd
out through the door quicker than aftybiic
could have kicked him out.
We put to sea in ballast, and had a lively
and enjoyable trip. A Yankee barque and a
four-masted schooner were racing us across
the North Pacific to Puget Sound. Off Wu
Sung three sets of windlass pawls clanked as
one. Three clouds of canvas flashed into
being, and three ferociously-driven vessels
were straining on a long board toward the
Japanese coast. As mentioned, we had a
stirring trip, for we had more than, a fair
whack of bad weather, and alwavs middling-
strong breezes that hardly ever blew over her
stern. Hence the crew became expert at walk-
ing as if on a steep roof, for we made the
old Aberdeen clipper leap from sea to sea so
that often her forefoot and the half, almost,
of her keel could be seen from the end of the
flying jib-boom. A desperate ginger streak
of a cat was seen now and then making
record passages along the deck from the
poop to the forecastle head. Came a week
of gales, with the wind two points free on
the starboard tack, and a ship under lower
topsails and reefed foresail “making a pas-
sage”__<3o you know the joy of that phrase.
—mostly on her beam ends. . In all that time
there was no sign of the Chinese cat. When
the man who was thrown one night from the
upper-topsail yard by the ballooning sail,
down in the foreyard, whence he slid, un-
conscious. along the belly of the forestall and
miraculously hung doubled up between the
bull’s-eye and the buntline passing through
it whence he was rescued with a smashed
iaw bv Never-Mind-Whom —when this man
recovered consciousness the blow moderated.
Things had broken adrift in the forepeak,

SO opportunity was taken of the lull to open
the hatch and put things to rights. There
the ginger cat was found. And I don't
care what kind of cats you have known, a
cat like Ginger you have never seen. A
van osii had rolled from side to side
ml it had smashed open and the varnish had
spilled over and dried on the cat. His hair
pointed downwards exactly like yellow
icicles, and nearly all of him was as stiff as
a board. And lean! I doubt if he was
broader than the thickness of my hand. lie
was the misery of the Universe materialised.
I sat him on the fore-hatch in the only sickly
bit ot sunshine we had seen for a week, and
rubbed him with grease to see if the varnish
would soften and come off. After a drink and
a feed he looked a trifle more cheerful. Pre-
sently I picked him up to see if the varnish
had thawed. It hadn’t, but I noticed now
that his left thighbone was broken. AV e had
a funeral, and the ship was the poorer for a
Piece of old iron.
The race? Oh, yes, we won the race by
seven days. Of course, the Yankee barque
could have beaten us easily if she had not
sprung her foremast. I never heard why the
lankee four-masted schooner didn’t beat us
' couldn’t think of anything, perhaps. Yet
the barque had found time to tow one of the
men .overboard on the end of a rope, and'
practise other pleasantries on him. That
for once, proved a mistake, for the Mission
people in Port Townsend heard about it and
became instrumental in awarding skipper
and mate terms of penal servitude for brav-
cry at sea. Which really had nothing to do
with the cat. But, somehow, the rats dis-
appeared ; so Chinese Ginger had not lived
in vain.
On board another ship the rats also
became over-plentiful. There were all kinds
and sizes, in blends of color ranging from
v lute to black. Though acquired on different
continents they lived sociably enough and
without pronounced racial prejudices. At
Penang, Straits Settlements, two cats were
cadged from a Chinese merchant. Tom was
ginger and the lady tabby. There was a good
deal of the lynx about them ; both were large,
long-legged, gaunt, with large heads and
long, hairy, upstanding ears. Por a married
couple they were unsociable, outside their
own company, and entirely lacking in a sense
of humor. They were not exactly afraid of
the strange white men (that kind of cat is
never afraid of anything), but overtures of
friendship were turned down with disdain.
These savages lived long enough to justify
their existence, but not long enough to regret
going to sea. There can be no doubt that
Thomas was drowned. Ilis absence passed
unnoticed until the doleful mewing of his
mate attracted attention. Thomas had a
habit of walking on the narrow moulding on
the outside of the ship, around the poop.
There he watched to say, “How d’ do?” to
the rats coming out through the ports from
the berths. More than once had I at night
seen his baleful face framed in my open
porthole. . Some night the ship had probably
been livelier than usual; or, perhaps a foot
had slipped on the greasy teak wood, and
there was one cat less in the world. Ilis
wife kept up the plaintive mewing for days,
and grew thinner and lankier. Then the
music ceased, and one morning she, too,
went. We found her stark and stiff and flat
under the forecastle head. Her heart was
broken.

Slippery Fame.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[lliis is the last of the short stories that Joseph
Gurry (“Stohr Ruddell”) wrote before he left for
where he was killed in action. Very few
of the younger men of the Australian press gave
such promise as Gurry; fewer still showed less dis-
position to settle down to steady, serious work. The
manner of his leaving Egypt was characteristic.
I '.red of waiting to be sent to the Front, he simply
slipped into a battalion that was marching out of
camp, and got through to the Peninsula—nobody but
i.urry knows how. He had learned rifle-shooting on
tlie butts at Broken Hill, where he began his press
work, and on landing in Turkey he was almost at
once set in a sniper's lair. It was fatal. The
brilliant youngster had no idea of not taking risks.
1 lanting himself out where he could do better work,
he was soon found by a Turkish bullet, which crashed
into his remarkable brain, killing him instantly.]
SXORKY had his own idea of fame, and
when he attained it and was refused
a rightful recognition he became as
scornful as any alderman. But he got
very much drunker.
In the dim, dead days, when some risk
attached to the profession of burglary in
Melbourne, Snorky was driven to Pentridge,
where he stayed two years. When he came
out he found it a handicap. Liz met him,
and resumed loafing relations, but the authori-
ties at Eussell-street had Snorky booked
for hard work on another stretch. There
was no middle way. Snorky had a violent
objection to picks and shovels, but it was
no more violent than the Itussell-street ob-
jection to Snorky as the custodian of petty
cash or the carrier of calico per lorry. And
the odds were against Snorky.
Loaning against a church fence in Collins-
street, when the plain-clothes police were
away having a drink, Snorky dispassion-
ately reviewed the situation.
‘Til have ter git out.” he told Liz. -‘While
Im ere they kin vag. me any time an’ give
me a round of the clock. If I get into the
hush for six months an’ come back Hush
I’ve got ’em settled.”
a ‘‘round of the clock” was recognised
.by Liz to mean, in legal language, one year’s
imprisonment With hard labor. Liz could not
object to Snorky choosing the lesser term
So she gave Snorky a maudlin “God speed.”
••Six .months at the outside.” Snorky
shouted as he turned into the corner pub to
break into Liz’s last quid.
dhat was 10 years ago. Mythical cheques
were then to be picked up in the shearing-
sheds from a lucky day in the two-up ring,
by bursting open the station safe, or, as a
last hope, by a severe course of rouseabout-
ing. Snorky was prepared for any one of
the three, and he struck a shed where rouse-
abouts were wanted, two-up was a perpetual
vice, and the station safe was alluringlv
inviting.
Snorky worked and missed fortune in the
two-up ring. He ended as he began, and
the police alleged that he was attempting to
open the safe when the manager, the book-
keeper and the expert assaulted him in the
office early in the morning. But as his repu-
tation was the other side of the Murray he
escaped with two years.
Snorky confirmed the police view when I
met him one cold morning, swagless, in
Goulburn. They had opened the gate to
him before dawn. lie was lost, disgusted
and disheartened. When the pubs opened
we had a pint, and Snorky penned this
note: —■
Deer Liz, —I waz tryin’ the tank when they come
in on me an’ they sent me along here for a sixer.
They didn’t jerry to me, so I didn t write before.
Come out this mornin’ and goin’ cuttin’ wood with
a bloke what reckons we can pick up a chek quick.
Be down in arf-year.
B e borrowed a stamp at the Presbyterj',
and introduced ourselves to axe, maul and
wedges. Snorky groaned in agony. It
was his first offence. He bogged in till
his hands hardened, but, strangely enough,
as the terror of toil decreased his thirst grew
to terrific dimensions, and at the end of the
‘ ’arf-year” he left broke.
I met him on the ’Bidgee on and off for
the next six or seven years, always battling
against his thirst. But the cheque re-
mained to be made. In the interval the sun
had browned the Bourke-street face, and the
toil had hardened the beer-fed muscles of
the slums.
He defied his thirst when it was in its
fiercest mood. Lying under a river bridge
with ten crisp five-pound notes, the pub
beckoned him, but he resisted the call. The
rightful owner of the banknotes was too
ne ai. and though he snored wifh some force
lie might wake at any moment and bawl out,
’ Some cow’s been through me.” So Snorky
turned his back on temptation.

Look To Your Health
for it is without a doubt the most important part of a well-ordered
life. Good Health may be truly considered to be the basis of both
success and satisfaction; commercial ability as well as social qualities
are largely dependent upon the possession of this greatest of all
blessings. Now in order to enjoy good health it is essential to bear in
mind that certain conditions must prevail. The process of digestion
must be carried on with regularity and harmony; the appetite must be
good ; the bowels must be in a state of healthy activity ; the liver and
the kidneys must perform their functions with efficiency. How are
these desirable conditions to be brought about ? One simple method is
strongly recommended; namely,an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills.
This medicinal preparation has been proved beyond contradiction to
be of great value in the prevention and cure of most of the ailments to
which the digestive organs are liable. Such symptoms as biliousness,
constipation, depression, flatulence, headache, indigestion in many
distressing forms —all speedily yield to the remedial influence of
