FREDERICK LOCKER
IT is convenient to have Frederick Lockers
verses the “Golden Treasury Series”
(London Lyrics; Macmillan; 2s. o>d. ),
although in new, modern type the lines
seem to lose something of their old-fashioned
charm. One has never seen Locker look as well
as in W. D. Adams’s Songs of Society, a Pickering
book where type and page exactly met his idio-
syncrasy.
Locker (one may shed the intrusive Lampson,
as it is shed in Austin Dobson’s preface : he
is a writer who needs a new name from the
fairies) was born at Greenwich Hospital in 1821.
His father was Civil Commissioner of the Hos-
Jital: his grandfather, a naval officer, had been
deutenant-Governor. Locker gives this as his
earliest recollection:
I recollect a nurse call’d Ann,
Who carried me about the grass,
And one fine day a fine young man
Came out and kiss’d the pretty lass.,
She did not make the least objection !
Thinks I, “ Aha !
When I can talk I ’ll tell Mamma.”
And that’s my earliest recollection.
He did not attend a University, and started
business life in a “colonial broker’s” office in
Mincing Lane. Prom twenty to thirty he was
clerk at Somerset House and under the Admiralty:
then, marrying Lady Charlotte Bruce, he began
happy years of literary leisure till his death, a
decade ago. He tells the story of his wedding
engagement in My Confidences (1896):
This is how it came about. We had seated ourselves on
a bench, and neither spoke. I took her hand. “ This is
the prettiest hand in all the world,” said I. “ I happen
to know of one that’s quite as pretty,” said she. Another
silence. Perhaps I was incredulous, but when she put the
other pretty hand into mine I knew that we both were
very happy.
His wife’s family influence and affluence made
Locker’s life-path easy. A married ‘ ‘ man about
town,” he joined the city’s society of wits, and
celebrated its fashionable resorts in affectionate
verses. Lady Charlotte died in 1872, and at the
age of 53 he was married a second time : to Miss
Hannah Lampson, whose name, eleven years
later, he took in addition to his own.
The first book of London Lyrics was published
in 1857 —a handful of twenty-six pieces that
through years and editions, changes and losses,
grew to the sixty-four finally approved. Off-
shoots, outcasts and others were collected in a
volume privately’ printed, the London Rhymes of
1882. A small collection of prose essays and frag-
ments appeared as Patchwork in 1879. In his
later years Locker was an enthusiastic collector of
old books, old prints, old china ; his library at
Rowfant, Sussex, became famous. Three months
ago, to the scandal of literary England, the collec-
tion was sold privately to an American bookseller
and transported to the United States.
His long and fortunate life in the literary world
saved Frederick Locker for a space from the obli-
vion that has befallen Mortimer Collins and
Thomas Haynes Bayly : each with a vogue once
equal to his, and a merit equal at least, if dissimi-
lar. Londoners must regard Locker with peculiar
affection, but his claim on literature is slight. The
work is to be cherished rather for personal atmo-
sphere than for intrinsic value : it brings a message
from an elder generation, better-tempered, better-
bred. Its virtue is somewhat valetudinarian : the
verses will walk with you, if you come to them in
their own mood ; but they do not run to meet you.
They are cheerful, yet not gay; melancholy,
yet not sad ; satirical, yet not cynical. This is the
mood that Locker sought for ? Maybe •or was it
the mode he could manage ? Did he fix, was he
fixed by, his own limitations ? One thinks the
verse is more than usually the man. If it is less
bright than Bsuyly’S, that is because Locker was
more tender than Bayly, It is less easy than
Praed’s, but Locker did not have Praed’s practice
at Eton. One may even dream of naval discipline
in it: the epithets are conned as Locker’s grandfer
might have conned a ship, with nicest eye and
touch. Well, it is agreeable, fine ; and in its
elder age the mellow sentiment may delight us in
our own.
A good portrait is added to the volume: one
needs Du Maurier’s sketch as well. At p. 30 des
is misprinted for de.
O :
Some editors reject copy politely, and some...
don’t. Besant has just been quoted as relating
that one editor of his acquaintance used to signify
that he did n’t want a manuscript by scrawl-
ing across the front page the cabalistic letters
“ U.8.D.”
“ I would not give a farthing for a book unless I were at
liberty to blot it with niy criticisms.”—Burns.
A. E. Gunn gives this graphic description'of a
mangrove swamp in the real North (quoted by-
Searcy in In Northern Sects) .■
The place seemed to be the very heart of the huge
solitude in which we were situated. Overhead there was
a dark, closely-knitted canopy of leaves. Only here and
there a patch of ineffably blue skv, that appeared to be
immeasurably distant, gleamed through rifts in the
firmament of foliage. Through the apertures the sun
shot vertical shafts of golden light that counterfeited
gilded pillars, except where their masses were broken by
contact with the trunks and limbs of the trees.
But the lights that stole through only made the gloom
more ghostly and unreal by the contrast. It was like a
weird, uncanny underworld, a vast, shapeless vault,
whose roof was support ed by gnarled and knotted trunks,
carved with fantastic devices by the processes of Nature.
Slender flying buttresses vaulted away from the trunks in
long series of elliptical arches. The whole scheme of de-
sign of the jungle might'have been that of an unimagin-
able mediaeval cathedral, conceived in a nightmare and
executed in a delirium. It seemed to be peopled by un-
seen, silent, thinking, feeling beiim-s, capable of action ;
and the twisted and contorted boughs and branches,
stretching out hideous, mud-strained arms, that appeared
ever intent on catching and holding one in their loath-
some embraces, intensified the impression.
The atmosphere was stifling, and permeated with a hot,
miasmatic vapour. The’silence was intense, and broken
only by faint sounds of something moving forward, the
gasping of shellfish that lay in the mud or clung to the
roots and trunks of the mangroves. So still was it, one
could almost hear the mdisture exuding from the
ooze, or the sap coursing in the veins of trees...
There was no distance, no vista, no perspective, only
knotted and twisted trunks, a tangle of boughs and
branches and roots, of roots and and boughs.
Above, a roof of leaden leaves; underfoot, a slushy, noisome
ooze of decaying leaves, roots, shells, and mud.
LONDON LERICS
THE UNREALIZED IDEAL .
My only Love is always near, —
In country or in town
I see ller twinkling feet, I hear
The whisper of her gown.
She foots it ever fair and young,
Her locks are tied in haste,
And one is o’er her shoulder flung,
And hangs below her waist.
She ran before me in the meads ;
And down this world-worn track
She leads me on ; but while she leads
She never gazes back.
And yet her voice is in my dreams,
, To witch me more and more ;
That wooing voice ! Ah me, it seems
Less near me than of yore.
Lightly I sped when hope was high,
And youth beguiled the chaSe ;
I follow—follow still'; but I
Shall never see her Face.
AT HER WINDOW.
Ah, Minstrel, how strange is
The carol you sing !
Let Psyche, who ranges-
The garden of spring,
Remember the changes
December will bring.
Beating Heart ! we come again
Where my Love reposes :
This is Mabel’s window-pane ;
These are Mabel’s roses.
Is she nested ? Does she kneel
In the twilight stilly,
Lily clad from throat to heel,
She, my virgin Lily ?
Soon the wan, the wistful stars,
Fading, will forsake her ;
Elves of light, on beamy bars,
Whisper then and wake her.
Let this friendly pebble plead
At her flowery grating ;
If she hear me will she heed ?
Mabel, I am waiting.
Mabel will be deck’d anon,
Zoned in bride’s apparel;
Happy zone ! Oh hark to yon
Passion-shaken carol !
Sing thy song, thou tranced thrush
Pipe thy best, thy clearest;
Hush, her lattice moves, oh hush,
Dearest Mabel! — dearest.
ADVICE TO A POET.
Dear Poet, do not rhyme at all!
But if you must don’t tell your neighbours.
Or five in six, who cannot scrawl,
Will dub you “ donkey ” for your labours.
This epithet may seem unjust
To you, or any verse-begetter ;
Must we admit, I fear we must,
That nine in ten deserve no better ?
Then let them bray with leathern lungs.
And match you with the beast that grazes;
Or wag their heads and hold their tongues,
Or damn you with the faintest praises.
Be patient, for be sure you won t
Win vogue without extreme vexation;
And hope for sympathy,—but don’t
Expect it from a near relation.
When strangers first approved my books,
My kindred marvell’d what the praise meant;
They now wear more respectful looks,
But can’t get over their amazement.
Indeed, they’ve power to wound beyond
That wielded by the fiercest hater,
For all the time they are so fond—
Which makes the aggravation greater.
Most warblers only half express
The threadbare'thoughts they feebly utter :
Now if they tried for something less,
They might not sink, and gasp, and flutter.
Fly low at first, —then mount and win
The niche for which the town’s contesting.;
And never mind your kith and kin,—
But never give them cause for jesting.
Hold Pegasus in hand, control
A taste for ornament ensnaring :
Simplicity is yet the soul
Of all that Time deems worth the sparing.
Long lays are not a lively sport,
So clip your own to half a quarter ;
If readers now don’t think them short,
Posterity will cut them shorter,
I look on bards who whine for praise
With feelings of profoundest pity :
They hunger for the poet’s bays,
And swear one’s waspish when one’s witty.
The critic’s lot is passing hard.
Between ourselves, I think, reviewers,
When call’d to truss a crowing bard,
Should not be sparing of the skewers.
We all, the foolish and the wise,
. .Regard our verse with fascination,
Through asinine-paternal eyes,
And hues of Fancy’s own creation ;
Prythee, then, check that passing sneer
At any self-deluded rhymer
Who thinks his beer (the smallest beer !)
Has all the gust of alt Hoclihnmer.
Oh, for the Poet-Voice that swells
To lofty truths, or noble curses—
I only wear the cap and bells,
And yet some tears are in my verses.
I softly trill my sparrow reed,
Pleased if but one should like the twitter ;
Humbly I lay it down to to heed
A music or a minstrel fitter.
Man's Responsibilitji, “or How, and Why, the
Almighty Introduced Evil upon the Earth,” comes
from G. P. Putnam’s Sons, N.Y. Read with
difficulty to p. 3(5, where :
<But here, in the Conscience implanted by the Almighty
in man, we have a spectroscope which can reach beyond
the remotest star, aud, surveying infinity, can nnaivse
and search) out the essence of the Almighty Himself.. i
After that unveracious statement read no more.
There is room for dogma with the least shred of
evidence to back it, but no room for a dogma which
explains the Incomprehensibility of the ’nscru-
table without any evidence whatever.
TWO NEW BOOKS
CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM, praised as
an illuminating Scot, has published
another collection of sketches, titled Pro-
gress (Loud., Duckworth; 65.) it is a
fine series, with a general message not imagi-
native but ratiocinative, and reasoned always
in the same fashion from data that Graham
has travelled far to find. He needs Ins data
in order to write ; bis outlook does not vary ,
vet his vision is so lofty upon a landscape so
diversified that one cannot have better company.
The modernity of his literary style urges the
radical difference between this generation and a I
others preceding. English did not contain such
phrases, such contrasts and harmonies of phrases,
before the last century-end. See how a language
recreates itself, turning ever a fresh face to the
light! dt is primitive races, untravelled places,
that attract Graham. He considers civilisation
with a sardonic humour that is close to contempt;
and as The Bulletin will reach here and there a
beach-comber, one may cite this passage for
pondering :
If it is true that only simple folk shall be the real
inheritors of the earth, it may be said with equal truth
that those who fail possess it presently. whilst the
world claims a man, and he enjoys the esteem or hatred
of his fellows, he can inherit nothing-, or, at best, only
inherit property, the true primeval curse.
The praise of men, the pettiness of greatness, and the
attachment to the thousand nothings which ensure
success, so cramp a man that he is left without the
leisure to enjoy his life. Life only really is understood
either by simple men whose cares and joys are bounded
by the parish where they live, or by thos.| disillusioned
folk who look out on the world as a covy looks out on a
road, resting her head upon a gate. Your true Nirvana
can onlv he attained by those who, in the sun, the tides,
the phases of the moon, the miracle of buds and flowers,,
green leaf and then dry boughs again, find happiness, and
pass their lives in thinking without bitterness on that which
might have been. Occasionally on some lost island beach
in the Pacific, in ranches on the plains, in hulks upon the
Oil rivers, in seeming uncongenial places up and down
the world, we come across them. Sometimes, indeed,
amongst the busv haunts of men they live detached, aloof
from all around them ; but in every case their touchstone
is the apparent failure of their lives.
That is, thev must have had some quality which put
them out of time, made them too sharp or flat, not up to
concert pitch ; in fact; unfit for excellence in the
pursuits their fellows prize, and rise to eminence
by following, becoming county councillors, generals,
and admirals of routine -- eminent, worthy, and
uninteresting dying high in the respect of those
who, born -without "appreciation, endue their heroes
with their own qualities intensified. Something of pathos
clings to those who, having left the world alone to run its
maddening course, have thus beeome, as it were, moth-
eaten gods in threadbare marriage garments. To be a
god is to be quite detached from all around, or else so
permeated with everything as to be part of it. So live
the trees, the grass, the birds and beasts, and, as a
general rule, those men from Whom alone one can expect
something out of the common ; something within them-
selves which far surpasses all accomplishment. A painter
or a poet (all but the greatest) may excel and yet be
common as a countess in Mayfair, or as a shop-girl m
the Brompton Road ; but the beach-eoomber or the man
left stranded by the -waves of life may be a drunkard,
possibly a thief, but it is hard for him to be a snob, for, if
he had been, he must inevitably have drifted to success.
The world is to the snob ; he easily outgoes the cad, the
merchant, the philosopher; the artist, poet, or what-not;
for they, if they are really true, must show themselves
such as they are, whilst the snob’s art is to appear some-
thing that fie is not.
In general, the storm-stayed prisoners of Fate pass
all their time in waiting for a wind ; but their
peculiarity is that if, after their years of wait-
ing, it should blow fair towards the port, which they
have dreamed about, making it in their vision only an
antechamber to the heaven of the Apocalypse, they would
not set their sails. Pride may be keeps them back, or a dim
feeling that they are happy where they are, or a vague
fear of the continual roar of cabs, or something which
they cannot formulate; in the same way a bird long
prisoned in a cage fears to fly out, although the floor is
open wide and not a cat in sight to make him doubtful of
the strength of his long-unaccustomed wings.
F. S. Delmer, well-known in these latitudes (he
contributed to The Bulletin, and was represented
in The Bulletin Storg Book ; had the honour of
being pedagogue in-1. B. O'Hara's school at Mel-
bourne, and brought away the belief that to be
a Victorian pedagogue; and a successful one, damns
a man... out of humanity ; that is a moderateand
impartial judgment ” ; —had the glory of being
pedagogue and so many other peda-things a.t Syd.
Grammar School, where duties are multifarious,
that his proud spirit rebelled ;--and then, being
told by a University professor that his Australian
career was at an end, shook off the dust of this
disconsolate continent and departed to Germany,
where he became a Uni. lecturer at Heidelberg,
and later at Berlin ; was appreciated and praised,
and is now doing useful work in converting'
English literature to German, and German to
English all that in one breath) has translated
the most popular of to-day s homely German
novels: Jiirn Uhl , by Gustav Frenssen (Loud.,
Constable; 2s. 6d.). The translation is so very-
well done that it has original virtue : only in the
earlier pages is there a little stiffness (30-43 e.g.).
Jorn Uhl is a good, long, honest book, with the
wholesonTe heartiness of Lorita Doone , allowing
for the German systole ; a picture of rural life and
character painted on the broad canvas of human
emotion. The matter is realistic; the manner of
German simplicity brightened by German enthu-
siasm, and not without lyrical passages and pas-
sages of wise commentary. “ Self-condensed
diligence ”, is a neat phrase for a farmer’s savings
put out at interest. One of the characters “beamed
and smiled the sort of wisdom which says to
Sorrow, ‘I will softly laugh at you,’ and to Joy
‘ I will softly weep over you.’ ’’ The ideas of a
girl who reverses the incident of one of Maitland’s
novels, and sees unexpectedly the nude figure of a
man in twilight,—a girl who until then has been
of a temperament too frigid for love, yet revolting
against herself, —are described in words full of
suggestion :
.. . like a revelation there came over her the brave,
enlightening,thought that this apparition was not there
by mere chance, but in order that she might be healed by
a return to Nature. She saw the lithe, proud, strong
frame, how as in some harmonious temple one part stood
free and strong upon the other, rising to the knees, then
growing broader in strong and youthful power to the
hips, then strong and rushing, like a cry of delight, up to
the breast and the head, which was bowed down in
thought ; and as she looked only for a moment, her
impost soul told her that here pure truth had her dwel-
ling, here, where God and Nature are housed together in
sweet, pure union. She felt that the man there was the
comrade of her innermost being, with whom, in giving
and taking, each with his especial gifts would roundoff
his own incomplete nature to a nature full and whole.
And there is a picture of fighting at Gravelotte
that rivals the similar descriptions of Tolstoy and
Crane. Altogether the book is well worth buying.
It is written in a large spirit, and opens a new
window upon the old spectacle of individual des-
tiny amid tlie universal life.

The new edition of Rossetti’s poems includes
the famous sonnet of “Nuptial Sleep” that scan-
dalised Robert Buchanan on its original appear-
ance. It was dropped from the “Collected
Works ” and now reappears : as under—
NUPTIAL SLEEP.
At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart :
And as the last slow sudden drops kre shed
From sparkling eaves token all the storm has fled,
So singly flagged the pulses of each heart.
Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start
Of married flowers to either side outspread
From the knit stem ; yet still their mouths, burnt red,
Fawned on. each other where they lay apart.
Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams,
And their dreams tvatched them sink, and slid away.
Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams
Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day;
Till from some wonder of new ivoods and streams
He woke, c*nd wondered more : for there she lag.

More stories of Sophie Arnould :
The Due de Praslin once asked after a fille de
Vopera with whom he had been acquainted, but
whose name he had forgotten. He described her
to Sophie as well as he was able, and concluded
by saying that though lie could not remember all
the name, he knew it ended in “ain.” “Ah!
Monsieur le Due,” replied Sophie, “you must
give a more exact description than that, or you ’ll
never find her. We all have a name that ends in
‘ain.’” .
To the leader of an orchestra, who insisted upon
playing music in the tempo in which it was
written, Sophie said, “ Sir, your orchestra pre-
vents me from singing as I wish ; it puts me out.’
“Nevertheless, Mademoiselle, we were keeping
the time.” “Quelle bete est-ce celh? Follow
me, if you please, and learn that your accom-
paniment is nothing more than the servant of the
actress who is reciting.”
Upon Mile. Daguerre the Due de Bouillon spent
800,000 francs in three months. During her ill-
ness, someone asked Sophie if Mile. Laguerre was
better. “ Poor girl, she is still very ill,” replied
Sophie, “and lives on nothing but bouillon.”
One day Sophie met a money-lender, famous for
the ruin'that followed in his path. He was
carrying a splendid muff. “ How can he have
cold hands,’ she exclaimed,” when he has them
always in our pockets?
Produced in Sophie’s day, the pifece of William
Tell turned out a rank failure. “ Well,” said she,
“ proverbs go by contraries. Here we have plenty
of Swiss and no money.” m ■
John Davidson, in Bond. Outlook :
The more I think of Byron, the more clear it becomes
to me that he is, first, second, and third, a tragic figure.
He was the child of a loveless marriage, that constant
source of huge armies of discordant natures. His up-
bringing was tragic ; his marriage was tragic ; his loves
were tragic ; his death, which at first I thought only
tragic-force, is actual tragedy. Byron and Napoleon,
contemporaries, Were the analogues and complements of
each other. Byron is the passive tragedy of the imagina-
tive temperament as poet, using expression ; Napoleon is
the active tragedy of the imaginative temperament as
warrior and world-eonipeller, employing deeds. Byron
inevitably ends in an abortive attempt at action in
Greece ; Napoleon, as inevitably, in an abortive attempt
at expression (ttie dictated memoirs) in St. Helena.
A personal poem, by Arthur Adams : “A
Memory”:
In these slack days, when larger memories faded sink,
One placid hour of happiness swims into view :
Of that day’s country ramble, and its end, I think,
When we together supped—l too tired aught to do
But eat and drink and leaning, watch you eat and drink,
With the warm thought behind—after the coffee, You 1
All, these poets !

The proof of the pudding is the eating; the proof of
the cartridge is its shooting. The great popularity-
attained by Winchester rifle and pistol cartridges
during a period of over 30 years is the best proof of
their shooting qualities. They always give satisfac-

Smokeless powder have the celebrated Winches-

handle than any cartridges of this caliber made.

A VIVID ACCOUNT
FOR YOUR BENEFIT.
The Case of Mr. S. SHAW.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
A vivid account appears below of
the extraordinary experiences of Mr.
Samuel Shaw, of Mo. 208 Liverpool-
street, Sydney, where he has been liv-
ing1 for the past fifteen years.
“It is over half a century ago since
I came from Manchester to this coun-
try," Mr. Shaw observed to a report
or, “and up to a certain period I had
nothing to complain of about my
health. Then my luck changed, and for
fully ten years I had an annual visit
from a complaint that seemed to have
got hold of me for good."
“What was the nature of it ?’’ en-
quired the pressman.
“It was neuralgia that paid me
those yearly attentions, hut in addi-
tion to that I was greatly troubled
with indigestion. Indeed. 1 blame the
latter for causing the former, as it
was when I became unable to digest
my food that I first noticed how sad-
ly my general health was falling off.
My system seemed to go to pieces bit
by bit, and then my nerves had just
about broken down altogether, when
my physical tortures/ were at their
worsit. The pains in my head were so
terribly severe that the softest pillow
felt as if it were filled with sharp
edged stones that cut right into me.
All about my jaws and gums I was
so sore and tender that I could not
bear anything to touch me, and 1
would flinch from the application of
a piece of wadding as though it was
a hard, rough substanco of a pene-
trating character/'
“I suppose your sleep would be
greatly interfered with ?’’
“Oh ! don't mention anything about
sleep, for i positively dread to recall
the numberless nights that T put in
without getting, any at all -simply
turning from side to side in suen
agony that often I wished myself dead
instead of existing in such misery.
Sometimes the pains would late one
side of my head and face, and on other
occasions the opposite side would be
al’ected. My eyes, round the back of
my neck —goodness ! 1 don’t know
where the pain did not exist. It was
awful, and you can easily imagine how
miu h suffering can ma: e one’s life a
burden to him. I know mine was, for
1 was dreadfully melancholy. There
was always some fearful thing going
to happen, according to my mined
Trouble in every direction. and the
strange part of it was tint. although
the calamit.es did not okc.tr when 1
imagined they would, still I cou d not
help worrying over the same notions
on subsequent days. That will show
you what an unhappy frame of mind I
found myself in owing to my excessive
weakness, and it was surprising how
irritable the least thing used to make
me. The slightest noise coming sud-
denly threw me into a state of excite-
ment and caused my nerves to- shake
quite visibly, and if 1 exerted myself
a little bit the trembling was just as
bad. The trouble was that the longer
my sufferings continued the worse
they became. My organs of digestion
were getting more incapable of doing
their work every day, and although,
owing to the poorness of my appetite,
J. took but very little food, still it
was always enough to greatly increase
the torments 1 was already enduring."
“You had made efforts’to overcome
those afflictions, i expect ?"
“Repeatedly .1 had tried, but it all
seemed useless. Years ago 1 had
consulted a doctor in Victoria, and
again in Svdnev I had placed
myself under the care of seve-
ral medical experts, who could not
cure me, and naturally 1 thought
ray load of suffering would eventually
drag me down to the grave. My at-
tempts to get better did not cease
when the doctors’ medicines failed.
Mo ; I tried many others, only to be
again doomed to disappointment, for
the heavy foelings in the chest were
still there after taking a little food,
the annoying pains between my shoul-
ders had not moved an inch, and the
aching sensations across toy loiris
were just as troublesome as ever. 1
still got up with a coated tongue and
a nasty tasite of a morning, the sud-
den giddy turns had not yet been
checked, and the appalling sense of
utter feebleness and dejection was
bearing down upon me more forcibly
and more alarmingly than ever. One
thing was certairv—that a change one
way or the other would soon take
place, and it was a decided change for
the better that came, and the cause
of it all was nothing but Clements
Tonic, and that is the reason why 1
have since recommended that remedy
to hundreds of other people, who have
always thanked me for my advice af-
terwards, Do you know that I had
quite given up hope of ever being
cured, and had lost all faith in medi-
cines because of having tried every
one of them without any good result-
ing, and would never have ta' en
Clements'Tonic only that 1 happened
to pick up an old paper and saw in
it the names of some influential peo-
ple, friends of mine, who wore testify-
ing to its efficacy. _ That day 1 got
some Clements Tome, and the very
hrst night J obtained a little ease." ’
"Mow long ago is that '!"
"Tight years or more, and I am in-
deed grateful to be able to say that
ever since my health has been all that
1 could wish, for by continuing Clem-
ents Tonic lor a while 1 succeeded in
throwing oil all the ailments that had
made me thoroughly sick and tired
of my life. Tittle by little the neural-
gic pains that for years had nearly
driven me mad abated. it rea.ly
seemed too good to be true, but there
was no doubt about the complete
manner in which Clements Tonic cured
me. blot only did my head pains ul-
timately die away and never occur
again, 'but i gained in health ail round,
it was something new for me to fall
asleep soon after settling down in
red and not wake again till breakfast
timo, and didn’t I leel the better for
it ! Truly, it is only fair to say that
Clements Tonic made an entirely
new man of me, for in every way 1
felt dii.erent. In a few weeks I was
taking food as heartily as ever, but
what i appreciate more was being a Je
to digest all I ate. res ; Clemen ta
Tonic put my digestion riaht and no
mistake, and 1 often ihin.r whait a
wonderful medicine it must be in view
of my many previous failures with
oil er so-called remedies, jvjy doctors
told me my liver and nerves were out
of order, so 1 am sure of not makin >•
a mistake when 1 advise my mentis to
take Clements Tonic for those com-
plaints, as it cured me thoroughly.
After all .1 had endured it was delight-
ful to again feel fresh and vigorous,
to forge ahead and find enjoyment in
everything that I came in’ contact
with. So different from being weak
and shaky, melancholy and irritable,
like 1 had been .; but I soon had every
cause to be cheerful, for Clements
Tonic had driven away each pain and
discomfort that had clouded my life
so long. My system was splendidly
toned and strengthened throughout,
and ever since I have enjoyed good,
sound, robust health i; so you may pub-
lish tnese facts in any way it pleases
you."
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

street, Sydney. In the State of New

Why not look

genuine pleas-
ure in holding
hack Father
Time fif-
teen or
| twenty
years. You
can do it
easily with
Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, for it
gives all that deep
and rich look to the
hair which belongs
to young life.
Ayer’s
Hair Vigor
You know the story—how good
Queen Bess, pointing to the beautiful
hair of a peasant girl, said, “ There’s a
real royal crown. I would trade my
golden one for it.” That was long ago.
Now you can have a “real royal crown”
of your own, simply by using Ayer’s
Hair Vigor. It makes the hair grow
thick and long and stops it falling
out.
When your hair is rich and heavy,
and when the closest inspection fails
to detect a single gray hair, you will
certainly look a great deal younger,
and you will be much better satisfied
with yourself, too. Isn’t that so ?

Shoes that are
brightest,

are those which have been made
to shine brilliantly with
Hauthaway’s
Crozine
Blacking
which not only puts shine on them, but soft-
ness into them. Thus, in addition to making
the surface of the leather look more beautiful
than it could be otherwise made to look, it in-
creases its wearing qualities, renders it pliant
to the foot, and altogether more pleasant and
comfortable to walk with. Boots never look
so ornamental, and are never so useful, as
when treated with this acidless blacking.
Can be had at all Boot Stores.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Prayer of a Hungry Soul.
Lord, in Thy mercy, hear our prayers,
And when Thou’st finished counting hairs
And watching sparrows as they fly,
And fixing planets in the sky,
Give Man some small attention.
He fain would live in constant ease ;
He’d gladly banish all disease ;
He’d like to draw a longer breath ;
He’d like to know a cure for death,
Or, better still, prevention.
Thou gavest man the carnal wish
To feed on meat and meal and fish ;
Implanted in his soul divine
An appetite for milk and wine—
Also for beer and gladness.
Thou hast enrooted in his brain
A mortal dread of work and pain ;
He still remembers they were given
In vengeance by offended Heaven
For Eve’s and Adam’s badness
But, Lord, Thy man is so increast
That where, at one time, he might feast,
And rest and feast and rest again,
Now he can scarce, with toil and pain,
Find half enough to feed him.
So now, Lord, in these latter days
Improve Thy man and mend his ways ;
Give him more bread and beef and beer.
Or, Lord, by some short path from here
To better pastures lead him.
Endow Thy man with stronger jaws ;
Sharpen his teeth, good Lord ; because
When fruits and flesh and flowers decay
He needs must pass the time away,
And eat one thing or other.
And, when at last the world’s consumed,
And planets, suns, and space are doomed,
Then, Lord, be near him in Thy might,
And, O, reduce his appetite,
And save a lot of bother.
W.A.
TOM BEASLEY.
Autumn.
Autumn wanders in the wood,
Trailing robes of red and gold,
Shudders coursing through her blood
As she dreams of winter cold.
“Butterflies and bees,” she sings,
“ It is time to fly away.
Swallows, blackbirds, spread your wings,
Winter comes; you may not stay.
“Blushing poppies, hide your heads,
For the cruel tyrant comes,
Close behind old Winter treads,
Hear his noisy fifes and drums !
Haze nut and berry black,
Hide your overflowing store;
Winter thunders at my back,
Let us cheat the villain hoar.
Clover bloom and Cape flower, gold
Buds and blossoms all, good-bye !
Autumn wails, our days are told,
Winter comes, and we must die.
“ Skies of rose and amethyst
Don your robes of hodden grey.”
Autumn sobbed, her hands she kissed.
Smiled and sighed, and flew away !
vio.
DOROTHY FRANCES M'CRAE.
In a Slam Suburb.
In a slummy, unsweet suburb,
On a level with the sea,
Where no harbor and no ocean
Irrigate the scenery;
Where the “ City girt with Pictures ”
Is a smudge of brown and gray,
With a view of aged nail-cans
Littering the narrow way.
All the streets are drab and shabby,
And the housewives dwelling there
They are faded as to garments,
And indefinite of hair.
There the loaf is 3^d.,
And it rises day by day,
And the eggs at 12 for lOd.
Turn the worried women gray.
It’s a low-down, smelly suburb
In the pit of city life,
Where the women wither early
In the struggle and the strife—
Yet no show-place by the waters,
Where the rich and gay crowd whirls,
Boasts as sturdy-limbed a legion
As its slum-bred boys and girls.
Up at daylight from each crowded
And insanitary den,
Running messages for mothers,
Little women, little men ;
And the little women bargain
For a ha’penny to the good.
While the little men are bending
To the ragged sacks of wood.
After school it’s final “shopping,”
Then a Bedlam in the street,
Where the bursted football’s lifted
By the little naked feet.
Till the wearied, worried mothers
Call their offspring home again,
Packing, anywhere, together,
Little women, little men.
But such little men and women
Are the country’s fairest hope,
And Australia wants more like them
With its coming woes to cope.
Still the moon of glass and silver
Seems a touch of irony,
When it lights the sleeping suburb
On a level with the sea.

Mr. J. KING, Swan’s St., North Freemantle, W. Australia
HAS BEEN CURED
OF A SCROTAL
RUPTURE
Mb. J. KING
of 20 years’ standing without operation, and has dis-
carded his truss. He had suffered not only from his rapture,
but also from the effects of ill-fitting spring trusses, which caused
more pain than the rupture. He had given up all hopes of a cure
until he heard of the Bice method. He tried it and it cured him.
Thousands of men, women and children have been cured by this
method without pain, danger or operation. Among them are
Chas. Pittner, Mossman, via Port Douglas, Queensland; Mrs.
F. Medley, 3SI, Swan Street, Richmond, Melbourne: L. Exton
(ohUd), 2, Harold Street, Newtown, near Sydney, N.S.W.; and
J. Westhead, River Darling, Pooncaria, N.S.W. Your rupture
cannot be worse than some I have cured. You owe it to yourself to
at least investigate carefully this method of oure. BEWARE of
any person or persons claiming to be or to have been at any time
connected with me in business in any way. Such statements are
absolutely fraudulent and devoid of all foundation. BEWARE
of all imitations of my method. The genuine Rice method can be
obtained from my London office only. I will send you a book
giving a complete description of rupture and its cure, and telling
why the Rice method has succeeded in so many thousands of
cases, if you will write for it. Do not be misled by worthless
guarantees, but write for mv world-wide-known and tested
method. Write to-day to W. S. RICE, Rupture Specialist

AN APPEAL TO THE FEDERAL LABOR
PARTY.
A very few days hence the Labor party meets in
conference, when it will have to decide how the
next great Australian political battle is to be
fought, and if it does not take this opportunity
to re-consider its ways, many of its best friends
will begin to despair of it. There is no room in
Australian polities, nor in any country’s politico
for a party with no definite fiscal opinions, and
there is nothing to be gained by pretending any
longer that the livest issue in all Australia is
dead, or that the most buoyant issue in all
Australia is sunk. At present the Freetrade
party in Australia is the party which is fight-
ing democratic progress tooth and claw, yet
it is the party which Labor-in-politics refuses
to attack on its most vulnerable point. And
the Protectionist party is the party which
consistently holds out the hand of friendship
and assistance to Labor, yet the Federal Labor
party, in its corporate capacity, declines to aid it.
in all the frenzied campaign of lies, slanders and
misrepresentation which constitutes what is called
the anti-Socialist movement, there is not one
prominent mover, or one prominent liar, or one
conspicuous slandererer, who is not a Freetrader.
It is exclusively a Freetrade uprising, because the
I reetraders recognise, even if the Labor men do
not, that a Freetrade policy is incompatible with
short hours, minimum wage laws, arbitration
courts, and everything else which tends to make
the Australian worker a more expensive worker
than the foreigner. Therefore it is natural to find
that it is a State Government composed of the
remnants of the old Freetrade party which is
undermining the N.S.W. Arbitration Act
and whittling it away to nothing. It is
equally natural to find that the pompous
office-bearers and leaders of the anti-Socialist
league are Freetraders practically to a man. It is
a part of the recognised order of things that the
prominent opponents of the White Australia
gospel, from Bruce Smith right down to the
vacillating Dobson, are Freetraders. It is in
keeping with the general fitness of circumstances,
and the orderly procession of the universe, that
practically every Freetrade paper now alive, or
only recently dead, in Australia, from the Bris-
bane Courier, Sydney Herald and Telegraph,
and Melbourne Argus, down to Jos. Symes’ athe-
istic Liberator, is, or has been, Labor’s bitter
enemy ; while the one influential daily, the Age,
which lends the d mocratic cause a helping
is also the most strenuous Protectionist daily paper
in Australasia; and every other paper—apart from
Publications owned and run by the party—
which has battled for Labor principles and Labor
ideals is Protectionist. And it is part of the
same orderly progress of events that every poli-
tician, outside the Labor party, who has fought
tor its principles—such men as O’Sullivan, Lynk,
miggins, Trenwith, Mauger, Chanter, Hume
Look, Isaacs, Kingston, and others —has been a
Protectionist. Those should be sufficiently broad
hints for any party.
* * • #
If the Federal Labor party likes to become the
party of High Protection, then power—the power
to do infinite good and to prevent infinite harm —
is within its grasp. It is possible to count about
a. dozen Federal members —say Lyne, Chanter,
Mauger, Chapman, Hume Cook, Groom, Kings-
ton, Keating, Trenwith, Mulcahy, Higgins,
Playford, and Isaacs —who, so far as can be
seen, are outside the party solely because it
lacks a strong Protectionist policy; and several
more, such as Deakin and Bonython, from
whom it is divided principally by the tariff issue.
.Li the party gives up its old negative attitude it
can gather in the bulk of these, and they are
mostly men with safe seats—men who can bring
their constituencies along with them. As against
this the party, by making a new departure,
might lose three seats, all in N.S.W.— those of
Canoblas, West Sydney and Darling. It is much
dkely, however, that it would lose none.
Ihe Freetraders have become so definitely and so
openiy the crowd that is opposed to every Labor
ideal that it is impossible to imagine a Labor con-
stituency rejecting a Labor candidate to elect one
of the Wilks or Bruce Smith brand. A year or
two ago, when Freetraders still posed as, in some
measure, the friends of Labor, it was possible to
imagine Hughes, as a High Protectionist, being
rejected m favor of a follower of Reid at West
bydney, but to-day such a thing is just about
impossible.
* * * *
If the Federal Labor party does not take this
short cut to power, and if it continues to stay out
in the cold and sink the fiscal issue, it will pro-
bab!y be a good many years before it arrives in
office with a reliable majority of its own. And
the irony of the position is that, when it does
arrive, it will have to give up sinking the fiscal
issue after all. It will have fooled away all these
years sacrificed them, not for the preservation of
a belief but to preserve the want of a befief—and
the sacrifice will be utterly wasted. The tariff is
a thing that Won’t Keep Still—at least not for
any length of time. It is so utterly impossible to
, e P, lt; that even the powerful Coalition
which attained office by sinking the fiscal issue
had not been in office six months before it was
dnven to appoint a Tariff Commission which tore
the buried problem out of its grave, and filled
the country with clamor. The tariff ghost
wifi be there, sitting on the front Treasury
bench, the day Watson assumes office. And
then, as one rampant anomaly after another
demands settlement, the Labor Government will
have to decide whether to settle each difficulty
by levelling the anomaly down towards Freetrade
or up towards Protection. It will have to take
one course or another. Of course, it may palter
with its conscience by being a very poor, apolo-
getic and half-hearted Freetrader or a very
inefficient and useless'.Protectionist, but it wiil
have to find a fiscal belief of some sort none the
less. It would have had to provide itself with
one by now if it had not been thrown out of office,
for it held office during its precarious four months 5,
tenure solely by the aid and countenance of Pro-
tectionists outside its own ranks, and it could not
be supposed that they would have gone on sup-
porting it for ever without large tariff concessions
m return. The principle of support in return for
concessions works both ways.
* * * *
Those who ask the Federal Labor party to be-
come the party of High Protection—the party
which stands for Australian patriotism, for Aus-
tralian progress, for Australian industry, for Aus-
traJian wealth, and for work and wages for Aus-
tralian citizens—do not ask it to give up a prin-
ciple. Ihey ask it rather to acquire a principle
u AT o I ?T? St T- Urgent matterin Australian politics
the JN.b. W. Labor party, which was the beginning
of Labor m Australian politics, said, for ten weary
years* ‘‘l dunno!” It handed on its negative
shibboleth to the Federal Labor party, and it in
turn, for four years, has said “I dunno!” To
“dunno ”is not a principle nor a belief—it is only
an And when the party is called upon
to KIN OW, it is only called upon to acquire in-
formation, to fill a void, to get some kind of a faith
to be a positive instead of a negative, and a fiscal
power instead of a shadow.
* * * .
Further, it is worth while for the present Labor
party to remember that if it continues not to know
m a fiscal sense it may yet have to give place to
another Labor party that does know. In that case
the present party may never get into power at all -
nor even into office, which, as its last year’s experi-
ence proved, is not quite the same thing. At pre-
sent it is putting a very heavy strain on the good-
will of a great mass of its supporters. When it
reaches power it will have to find a tariff policy
• U j i* . is , t° postpone its arrival almost
indefinitely, merely because it will not find a tariff
policy till it gets into power. Many of its sup-
porters begin to think that the mere joy and
pleasure and satisfaction of having no tariff policy
are not so joyful and pleasant and satisfactory as
to be worth the delay. The support which the
party gets from outside its own ranks comes almost
exclusively from Protectionist politicians, and Pro-
tectionist papers, and from the great mass of people
who elect these politicians and support these papers,
-these all represent a force which may grow weary
of too long waiting on the policy of “dunno’’
To them Protection—real Protection—is a matter
of the first importance, whatever it may be to the
a S rTregate political conscience of the Labor party
and their patience may give out. Again, while
the Labor party remains out of office, because it
would rather be a party which does not know its
mind on the tariff problem than have a definite
mind, and gather the democratic Protectionists
into its fold, and reach for power and office with
both hands while it does this, the enemy is in
charge, the White Australia policy is in cumber
the State Bank idea is defunct, Federal arbitration
is practically a dead letter, the hopes of getting a
Federal territory in which the private land-
grabber won t intrude are fading day by day and
the fabric of democratic progress threatens to go
to pieces. To see all this going on because the
Labor party declines to sacrifice the joy of
not being officially aware of its own fiscal views is
more than the loyalty of the party’s well-wishers
can stand for ever. The Labor party itself con-
sists very largely of Protectionists, and, in the end
these may secede. They may coalesce with the
democratic Protectionists outside on a platform
which embodies the Labor party’s principles and a
patriotic policy of promoting Australian wealth
and industries. In that case there would be two
Labor parties, and the party that did know would
probably so entirely overshadow the one that
didn’t know that the latter would amount to very
little. This may seem a fanciful danger, but it
is more real now than it ever was before.
-The only thing that can hold the present
nefarious Coalition together through the next elec-
tion is the continued sinking of the fiscal issue.
.The frantic demands of certain Coalition leaders
that the fight shall be solely on the question
of Socialism and anti-Socialism, and that
the tariff question. shall not be raised under any
circumstances, are in themselves evidence of that.
Already there is a distinct rift in the combina-
tion, as evidenced by the fact that the Protec-
tionist members of the Government stand almost
wholly aloof from the acti-Socialist agitation.
Mi Lean says little; Turner says practically
nothing; Drake says less than Turner, though,
so far as speaking to the purpose is concerned,
that is as much as Drake usually says. If all the
opponents of the Reid-M‘Lean Government went
to the country with High Protection in the front
of their programme, then half-Premier Reid must
needs defend himself where he was attacked. He
must needs defend Preetrade when his political
life depended upon it. And if Turner, M‘Lean
and their Protectionist adherents were placed
m such a position that they could not fight
against Watson without fighting against Protec-
tion, and could not fight for Reid without fighting
for Freetrade, the ill-jointed league would go to
pieces like a crate of crockery struck by lightning.
On the other hand, if the Labor party meets Reid
on the ground he has selected, and only hits
M‘Millan where he tells them to hit him, and
poses as the Socialistic party pure and simple
because Bruce Smith bids them do so, then it has
no chance—unless, indeed, these wily old political
battlers have greatly miscalculated. At all events,
by refusing to hit the Coalition on the one weak
spot—on the joint where the two ill-matched
halves of it are so badly fastened together—it will
give that body a fair chance of another lease of
life, and give it more time to undo what little
good has been accomplished. And not a
few people are apt to grow impatient with
a party which sacrifices _so many chances
mu • sa : ke preserving its fiscal indecision.
Ihe indecision hardly seems worth it. Especially
tho Protectionist members of tbe Labor party
who, if they raised the tariff war-cry, could smite
Lie enemy hip and thigh by themselves at next
general election, may grow weary of being held in,
and angry at seeing their opportunities offered up
as a burnt sacrifice on the altar which bears the
cheerless inscription “I dunno.”
• • * •
But if the Labor party does take to Protection
it must do so in real earnest or no permanent good
will result. Australia has no use for another
Dibbs tariff, which did little save bring Protection
into contempt. It doesn’t want the ineffective
Victorian tariff, which used to admit into that one
small state £13,000,000 worth of goods annually
for Victorian consumption alone. It doesn’t want
a mere barren, forgotten, formal plank, like that
vir kh? restriction of borrowing, which the
*l. 11 '• ®k*-te Labor party adopted and then
wholly ignored. It looks for something living and
vigorous—something like the tariff policy of Canada
or the United States, which is a gospel rather
than a mere dry plank. The aim should be, in
every industry that can be carried on in Aus-
tralia, to give the local producer a substantial
advantage, even with high Australian wages and
short Australian hours, over all competitors—even
the cheapest of them. It is necessary to get away,
not only from the bad present condition of things,
but from the very best past condition, and to aim
at something better than has ever yet been
attempted. And in discussing this matter it is
well to remind the party that there is nothing to
be gained by falling back on the old argument
about the lamentable condition of the workers in
some Protectionist countries, where trusts bloat,
and millionaires get gout, and men decay. No one
has asserted that Protection, without arbitration
laws and similar safeguards, secures to the
worker his fair share of the general wealth.
It is just to secure to the worker his fair share of
the general wealth that all the existing Labor
legislation of Australia, and all the further legis-
lation that will exist when the Labor party comes
really into power, is intended. But if it is
claimed that Australia dare not create industries
because the best safeguards that its democratic
party can devise will not prevent the worker being
oppressed in these industries, and that it dare not
accumulate wealth because the best Socialistic
policy it can construct won’t secure the worker his
fair share of that wealth, then the position is dis-
appointing beyond expression in words. The
I ederal Labor party can’t afford to pose as a
party which is afraid to come into power with a
mission to build up works like Carnegie’s in
Australia because it has no idea how to so use its
power as to prevent these works being run on
Carnegie principles.
LOANS AND IMMIGRATION.
In reply to an article (Bulletin, 22/6/’O5), Dr.
Arthur, M.L.A., writes :
At last election I belonged to the anti-borrowing party.
lam charged now with having forgotten it. I admit—
not that I have forgotten, but that I have changed my
nnnd. Much water has run under the bridge since last
August. A yellow race now holds the hegemony of the
Pacific, and the prestige of the white man in Asia is gone.
There is not at present a battleship belonging to a white
nation in the Pacific. Port Darwin is ten days from
Yokohama ; swift cruisers could do it in seven. We can
possibly rely on the British fleet, for 20 years. Perhaps
not so long, for immediately the German fleet increases to
anything like equality, England will need all her ships in
European waters.
Now, the problem—four million people in Australia,
with a rapidly declining birthrate and three million
square miles, some of it, at any rate, very fertile. Japan,
44 million inhabitants, increasing half-a-million a year,
and 160,000 square miles.
Next, read the opinions of Mr. Colk’s Japanese friends
as to where the surplus population of Japan must go;
and study history as to how militant nations have treated
their weak and WEALTHY neighbors, and then do a little
furious thinking. If this empty continent cannot get an
enormous increment of population in the next 20 years,
there will not be much doubt as to our destiny. All our
elaborate Anglo-Saxon civilisation will be swamped by
invasion, either peaceful or the reverse, from the Asia we
have despised ; our children mean whites and helots.
I affirm again, immigration of white races on a huge
scale is the chief remedy. I did not say it was the only
one. If there are others—High Protection, increased land
tax—let us try them all. I PROPOSE TO IMPORT
MONEY that we may import men. And import men to
settle them on the soil. The stunted factory hand doesn’t
supply the stuff to make soldiers of. Look at the recruit-
ing results in England during the South African war.
I only dealt with one side of the question in the Herald
letter. I would give our own people free land, too, with—
a matter you overlooked—a 2J per cent, land-tax on
unimproved value after five years. The late Charles
Pearson said “ The distant future of a country is so unim-
portant by the side of its immediate needs to the men in
possession, that even if they were reasonably certain that
a particular evil ought to be guarded against at an
immediate sacrifice, they would rarely be possessed of the
moral force required for the effort.” Is that to be true
for us ?
The above large capitals are intended to draw
attention to the brilliant idea of importing money
into a wealthy country.
* ♦ * *
The Bulletin has known cases in which a
member, when, like Dr. Arthur, he had changed
his mind on a most important part of the policy
on which he was elected, has thought it necessary
to inform his constituents of the fact and give
them a chance to object. Some members have
been so beastly conscientious as to resign and
stand for re-election, on the ground that the man
who gains his seat on one policy and holds it on
another, retains that seat under false pretences.
Dr. Arthur, apparently, has no such scruples.
When he was elected, he was on the non-borrowing
ticket, and he thought so little of his own alleged
political principles that he started to advocate
borrowing without even mentioning that, in so
doing, he had shifted his views. Some people
would call this easy turning of the coat a mean
political treachery ; others wouldn’t.
* * * *
Much water —and also a good deal of slush —has
certainly “run under the bridge since last
August.” Australia looks as if it were nearer to
a great danger than it ever was before, arid it
wants men—men —and yet more men. It has
been trying for the last 24 years or so to
attract population by heaping up debts, and
now it is, of all the great “new” countries
on earth, the one with the biggest debt per
head and the least immigration. And the
only remedy Dr. Arthur can see is to borrow
more, and to keep on borrowing. Canada and the
United States have practically left off borrowing,
and are reducing their debts; and they are rushed
with immigrants. Australia, in the view of Dr.
Arthur and the party to which he belongs, should
rather stick to the methods which have landed it
in the present bog than follow their example.
Australia has already made a huge experiment in
the way of assisted immigration—the kind that
consists of bringing people here and turning them
out to graze on the “magnificent natural resources
of the country,” and to “go on the land.” Up to
1903, it brought out 645,987 people in that way,
and spent much land revenue and over £3,400,000
of loan money on the work. The present result
seems to be stagnation, poverty, and an anxious
desire on the part of many of these purchased im-
migrants to get away again. _ Queensland did most
of all in the assisted loan-immigration business;
it spent £2,943,963 of borrowed money to bring out
169,538 immigrants, and its present position is al-
most the worst in Australasia.
• • • •
The “stunted factory hand” is a threadbare
jest. No doubt he is stunted in countries where
there are long hours, poor wages, crowded slums,
insanitary factories, ignorance and dirt. But with
clean and proper conditions, such as the Labor
party, which Dr. Arthur opposes, is trying to
enforce in Australia, he need not be more stunted
than anybody else. And even if he must be
stunted—even if the brawny iron worker, for in-
stance, must be a hollow-chested dwarf, and the
blacksmith, or brass-founder, or brickmaker, or
shipwright a weakling—the stunted man is better
behind a gun than no man at all. Also, unless we
get the stunted artisan here in large numbers
there is no market nearer than Europe for the
output of Dr. Arthur’s assisted loan immigrant,
who is to go on the land; and if the immigrant
has to depend on that, it would pay him better to
go to some place where there is quite as good soil
nearer to his market. That fact makes him diffi-
cult to get and still more difficult to keep.
* * • *
When war comes,. money, men and munitions
are the first essentials. Every country has to
borrow in war time. The gospel of the loan party
to which Dr. Arthur has attached himself seems
to be roughly this :
(1) To exhaust our credit in time of peace so that, when
war comes, we won’t be able to raise a copper.
(2) To make no special effort to establish the works
necessary for producing- the materials of defence—even
though those works, if established on a large enough scale
to meet all the requirements of war, would give employ-
ment to an immense number of men, and be in themselves
the biggest immigration scheme this country has ever
seen—lest we produce the “ stunted factory hand.”
This party, too, wants to “import money”—in
other words, to export money in interest—“that
we may import men.” What need can there be
to import money ? Australia, Dr. Arthur says,
is wealthy. It certainly pays away over £36,000,000
a year for foreign goods; in its consumption of
foreign goods it is almost the most luxurious place
on earth. If it wants to import men, let it raise
an extra £1.000,000 or £2,000,000 a year in taxa-
tion, do with £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 a year less
imports, and pay cash for its men. If it feels it
can t do without the goods, it will probably set to
work—if it gets a decent Protective tariff—and
make them, and thus find work for its imported
men. We want a morally sturdy and self-reliant
race when war comes our way; not a morally
stunted people who have been taught that they are
so cowardly and helpless that they can’t pay their
own way, despite the wealth which Dr. Arthur
acknowledges this country to possess.
* * « *
The Bulletin can picture Dr. Arthur’s Aus-
tralia when the great war strikes it—the Australia
which is to be saved by loan-immigration, and
“settling people on the land,” combined with an
off-hand disregard for local industries, and a
careful avoidance of the “stunted factory hand.”
We will, perhaps, have gained 1,000,000 immi-
grants, if we can borrow £15,000,000 or so to
bring them out; though we may have lost a good
many of them again. Past experience has shown
that if we make no serious efforts to provide any
work save “ going on the land,” we get verv few
immigrants save those we pay for, and when we
stop, paying, not only do immigrants stop
coming, but they often start going away again.
The command of the sea will, presumably, be lost,
or nearly so, otherwise we could not be invaded.
We will have gone bankrupt in Europe for various
reasons, including inability to export anything to
pay the interest. We will naturally have no
credit to raise foreign loans upon. As soon as the
supply actually on hand has been used up, we will
have no guns, rifles, ammunition, no steel plates
to build ships with, no steel rails to lay down light
railways for strategic purposes, or to replace lines
torn up by the enemy, and hardly any rolling
stock or locomotives to replace those injured, lost
or destroyed. We will be almost destitute of hats,
boots, clothes, medicines, spirits, surgical instru-
ments, bedding, tents, tools, telegraph wire, elec-
trical machinery, telescopes to look for the enemy
with, paper, and almost everything else—all for
want of local industries and the “ stunted factory
hand ” who runs them. When the enemy holds
the sea, the crops raised by the wonderful
array of loan-immigrants can’t be exported, and
there will be no local “stunted factory hand”
to buy them, so the surplus will rot
in the ground. And there will be a
ragged army attacking the enemy with clods and
with sheep-shears. On the other hand, what The
Bulletin aims at is to make Australia a country
which can supply itself with everything that will
be wanted in war—which also involves supplying
itself with everything that can be wanted in
peace. That means a country which has almost
entirely shut out imports, and which has had to
advertise for 1,000,000 artisans to make the things
it has hitherto imported—also a country where
artisans are not necessarily stunted. Further, it
means a country which has had to advertise for
another million or two of agriculturists to feed its


artisans and still more artisans to supply its new
agriculturists. Also, incidentally, it means a
country which hasn’t exhausted its credit before
the war begins. And before Australia can fill tle
bill in that respect it must leave off deficits, pay
for necessary works out of revenue, and reduce its
debt—the debt must be reduced to leave any use-
ful margin. And all that is possible-despite Dr.
Arthur’s theory that this is a wealthy country
which is so poor that it can’t do without borrowing.
THE HIGH COURT AND THE CABINET.
The telephones, with the exception of one, have
been cut off from the High Court Judges’ cham-
bers in Sydney, and the members of the supreme
judicial body of the Commonwealth are now
denied the convenience which practically every
civil servant above the grade of a clerk enjoys.
Three judges, three associates, and three tip-
staffs, occupying widely-apart rooms, must now
rush to the one telephone. It doesn’t seem a very
big grievance, but as the crowning point of the
Reid-Symon campaign of small, mean attempts
to bully and degrade the High Court it bulks
large. 'The telephones were installed m the first
instance without any request on the part of the
Judges—as part of the ordinary equipment of
the offices. They cost the bederal Government
nothing but the bare charge of the instrument, as the
’phone service is aF ederal monopoly; and removing
them is purely a bit of mischievous spite. All the
State Judges have telephones—though, in their
case, the State has to pay for them—as have all
the officials of any rank m either public or private
employ. If the'Federal Gqvernment wished to
save the cost of the several instruments, a switch
service with telephonette attachments might ha\e
been resorted to. But the motive isn t economy;
it’s mischief.
* * * *
The tipstaffs attached to the High Court have
received abrupt notice of dismissal. I his is
another pin-prick at the Federal judiciary. Ihe
tipstaff is, practically, a messenger. It s his busi-
ness to run errands for the Judge, to bring lum
what books he needs on the Bench, and generally
to do at one shilling an hour work that he can do
just as well as the man who draws £2 an hour.
Abolish office-boys in a mercantile house and the
demands on the time of the principals would so
increase as to cause a congestion of work, and call
for the employment of more officials. Abolish
tipstaffs for Judges and you bring within measure-
able distance the time when you must appoint an
additional Judge. It’s the saving of time effected
by getting a cheap unskilled worker to do the
little incidental bits of cheap work that enables big
officials to give good value for their big salaries.
But the Reid-Symon spite defies all econo-
mics. The High Court Ju.: o es are to be their
own errand-boys in future. And m their hurry
to have a tilt at the judiciary Reid and SyMon
haven’t considered even the law. Ine ± übiic
Service Act calls for independent reports from the
permanent head of a department and the 1 übLc
Service Commissioner before an office can be
abolished. The tipstaffs have been dismissed,
seemingly, on the mere say-so of Reid and Symon.
The Cabinet has fixed a new scale of expenses
for the High Court Judges. A Judge travelling
is to get £3 3s. a day for himself and Ins clerk-
associate, except when he is on original jurisdic-
tion, when he is to get, with his clerk, £2 IJs. oa.,
or if he is travelling with his brother Judges
each will get £1155.; the idea seems to be that
three Judges travelling together can sleep in the
same bed. The experience of the Federal Judges
so far, charging only out-of-pocket expenses, is that
nearly £4 a day is the average amount spent by a
and his clerk. That amount may seem
large, but it is to be kept in mind that a J udge
on circuit can’t stay at a cheap coffee-palace, hie
must be housed as befits his dignity, and hotel-
keepers charge for that. What is important to
note in this matter is that
1 The expense rate allowed is much less than, say,
the rate allowed to State Judges in N.S.W. .
2. It will, without doubt, involve the Judges m some
loss when travelling.
Reid and Symon further tap at the salaries of the
Judges with a proviso that the seat of the Oourt
is to be stationed at Melbourne, and if the Judges
do not live there they must lose any travelling
expenses incurred in going to Melbourne.
The Federal Judges’ salaries were, before these
exactions, lower than the judicial salaries m
NS W. and Victoria. Victoria pays from £3OOO
to'£8500; N.S.W. £2600 to £3OOO-in each case
with pension rights of, roughly, two-thirds of the
salary. A N.S.W. or Victorian Judge, disabled
by illness a month after his appointment, can
draw during the rest of his life nearly £2OOO a year.
The Federal Judges get from £3OOO to £3ooo a
vear with no pension rights. To all intents and
purposes their salaries have been. now reduced by
ILxecutive fiction, and the threat is held over them
of another reduction—presumably if they are not
obsequious to the Government. The independence
of the court is thus insidiously attacked. Attorney -
General Symon’s announced intentions at the
outset were to confine the sittings of the -Hugh
Court to Melbourne, and generally to ‘ take it
out” of its members. He has had to abandon any
direct attempt at the first part of his programme,
but he has succeeded in making it a matter of
penalty for the Judges to sit out of Melbourne,
and in heaping on them a mass of mean insmts
and petty indignities.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mr. "Willis Comes Back.
It is not within human nature to expect that
the Carruthers Government should show any
freat eagerness to push home the N.b. W.
lands Department Inquiry. At least three
members of the Cabinet—perhaps innocently
enough have at different times had fees
from° those land agents who show such a
strenuous objection to the Commission. Some
of the Ministry’s supporters in the Assembly
are implicated in what has been going on. And the
Premier himself is head of the law firm which
acted for one of the most uneasy of the witnesses
before the Commission. But, as The Bulletin
put it before, the public will demand to get
at the whole truth, even if afterwards it is
willing to condone a good deal of what was
improper, and to insist only on punishing
actual bribery and corruption. For any mem-
ber of Parliament to act as a land agent m
obtaining concessions from the Bands Depart-
ment whether he used his political influence in
the matter or not, is utterly and completely
objectionable. Yet several members of Parlia-
ment have so acted, and some of them, probably,
without recognition of the impropriety of the
action, certainly without any knowingly corrupt
motive. The people can afford to be charitable,
in dealing with them, as to the past, provided
the principal rogues are punished, and the future
is guarded against any repetition of the scandals
now being slowly disclosed. But the essential
thing is the truth—the whole truth. In eliciting
it, by the way, the frauds Commission must
have the further assistance of Mr. W. N. Willis.
The sincerity of the Government can fairly be
tested by that point. The Government alleged
that it had no legal power to ensure that. Still
Mr. Willis is coming back. Possibly not as a
witness before the Royal Commission, but certainly
in some way. Everybody knows that without the
help of Mr. Willis and Mr. Willis’ books the
inquiry will become practically a it.wdl
be time to order whitewash all round. The failure
of the Government to take steps to induce Mr.
Willis to return to Sydney, puts the Government
in much the same boat as Mr. Willis as a party
anxious to avoid the disclosure of the truth.
In Praise of Bent.
Last week Premier Bent, of Victoria, made a
dull speech of 150 minutes duration, and tried to
brighten up his statement of last year’s doings and
next year’s policy with limelight views. As a re-
sult of various hitches, he was compelled to read
his notes by the light of a dim candle, and his
angry countenance, as he perspired freely into the
candlestick, was a matter of public interest.
Nevertheless, he had something remarkable to
say. The borrowings for the current year, he
said, consisted of £104,000, all raised locally. The
amount paid off the public debt out of revenue
was £226,000, largely paid off in London; conse-
quently the Victorian debt was actually reduced
by £62,000. If this amazing statement proves
true, then Bent —even the dull, bear-like, clown-
ing Bent —is a man that Victoria can’t spare
until it finds another financier as good as
he. He looms up—or looms horizontally; it
is hard to say which —as the _ first Premier
Australia has possessed in something like lialf-a-
century who has reduced his State s debt, lie is
the first one who has aimed at any such reduction,
and almost the first one who seems to think public
solvency a matter to be proud of. F urthermore,
Bent hopes to drag together a surplus of over
£400,000, and with this he proposes to reduce the
accumulated shortage a little, to do a few public
works, and to pav for one or two resumed
estates. When the' land, which was originally
sold by the State so that the proceeds might help
the revenue, is re-purchased by the State, it is only
common honesty that the revenue should stand
the cost, but it h;.s been left for the common Bent,
of all men, to realise this simple fact. No doubt
Bent’s success is largely the result of economies
which have their basis in meanness and gross op-
pression, but there is a desperate necessity in Aus-
tralia for financial reform, and if the oppressor is
the only man who will supply it, then it becomes
necessary to hold a candle to the oppressor. It
is advisable to get rid of the Bent Govern-
ment, and replace it by one with some
liberalism and some sense of fairness in its treat-
ment of the public servants, but unless the new
Government will be as honest with the finances
as Bent (if his accounts can stand auditing) has
been, it is still more advisable to leave things as
thev are. If it is a choice between the coarse but
economical oppressor and the democratic spend-
thrift, Australia has reached such a point of debt
and financial degradation that it had better choose
the coarse but economical oppressor. Of course
Bent’s surplus is swelled by the inclusion of the
proceeds of land sales, said proceeds being treated
as revenue ; but the proceeds of land sal ys are not
a large item now in Victoria, and if Bent s figures
can stand official inspection, he seems likely, at the
close of the financial year, to accomplish three
things that sound almost incredible in Australian
finance: (1) To slightly reduce the debt; (2) to
set aside ail the land sale revenue for public
works and undertakings; and (3) to have some
small amount over, out of ordinary revenue,
to devote to public works and undertakings.
Even this may not be all that it should be, but
when it is remembered that there have been in
Australia Premiers quite as objectionable as
Bent, who used four times his land-sale revenue
to cover ordinary expenses, who borrowed two or
three millions a year and charged all their new
works, and all their land resumptions, and many
of their repairs to loans, and who then wound up
with a big deficit and a plausible lie, then Thomas
—even Thomas, of Brighton, the land-boomer, the
man of strange jobs and speculations, the ungrain-
matical person who says “ bloomin’” and ‘ * bang ”
—promises to shine like the countenance of a full
moon in a dark land. His financial success, should
it prove to be all it is alleged, will give the
democratic party a great set-back, and if Bent
undertakes to make the steady reduction of the
public debt and payment for works out of revenue
two fixed features of his policy, the set-back
will be still worse. The democratic party all
over Australia has had the chance to make
public honesty and solvency the front items
of its programme—and by its indifference it has
left that honor, glory, credit, and advertisement to
Bent. Supposing that person’s accounts really
stand the audit at the close of the financial year,
this paper proposes trying to be much more
respectful to Bent as a general tiling though it
will be a difficult undertaking.
4.
A Motion of Censure.
The motion of censure putupinN.S.W. Assembly
by Labor-leader M‘Go wen tottered last week to
an aged and ignominious conclusion. There was
hardly anything else that it could totter to under
the circumstances. The motion was a general
one, but it was founded principally, and in the
first place, on the neglect of Premier Caeeuthebs
to appoint a new Judge of the_ Arbitration Court.
Premier Caeeuthebs, who is a most bendable
man, almost broke his neck, or at least managed
to look as if he were almost breaking his neck, to
get a Judge appointed, whereby lie poured a con-
siderable amount of water over that particular hot
coal. Apart from the Arbitration question the
motion depended mostly on the local manu-
facture of locomotives, and CABEUTHEES’breatli-
less assurance that he couldn’t sleep at night for
attending to the matter of those same locomotives
was a considerable quantity of mud heaped on
that cinder. After Cabbuthees had turned the
water-tap of apology on those two matters, and had
backed down as far as possible, and crawled out
as far as possible, there was little heart in
the debate. It got down to a drivelsome level,
and included complaints about a flood or a burst
water-pipe in a back street of Sydney, some per-
sonal matter about a policeman, and a ridiculous
wail by a very ignorant Tory member concerning
the alleged height of ant-hills. The Labor party
might have made the debate a great fight on the
largest question in Australian politics, but it pre-
ferred to grope along on a low level and be a politi-
cal caterpillar down in the basement of things.
The party is pledged to oppose all loan expendi-
ture on new works except such as will pay full
interest on their cost and something over for sink-
ing fund. Premier Caekuthees pledged himself
almost as solemnly at last election to cut down
loan expenditure to £1,500,000 a year. He lias
broken his own pledge, and lias impudently stated,
in the speech with which Parliament opened, that
he will continue breaking it; and as for the Labor
party’s pledge, he takes as little notice of it as does
the Labor party itself. Then there is a considerable
number of members who have given their word of
honor, as members who are gentlemen and not
liars, to oppose all borrowing. Yet with all these
disturbing elements on hand, the financial ques-
tion —the question which, above all others, is a
matter of national importance—was not once
dealt with in the two weeks’ debate. The dis-
cussion might have been raised to the level of
something tnat suggested statesmanship; instead
it was, except as regards the Arbitration Court
matter, a long-dragged-out twaddling about small
matters, a weary procession of small jokes, and a
purposeless stonewall. Presumably no one out-
side Australia takes much interest in the matter.
But, if any extraneous person does care to study
it, this careful avoidance of great issues, and this
purposeless creeping among problems that are
almost too small to attract the attention of a
Drainage Board, must make him wonder whether
the N.S.W. Parliament knows that it is a Parlia-
ment or mistakes itself for its own office boy.
♦
The N.S.W. Arbitration Act.
Dr. Victor Clark was recently commissioned by
the Government of the United States to visit
Australia and report upon its labor conditions.
His report, the result of a long and exhaustive
investigation, has just been published in Aus-
tralia. Sydney Telegraph issued a “summary
of the report, but strangely enough, the
summarizer couldn’t find room for any of Dr.
Clark’s observations which told in favor of
Industrial Arbitration, though these observations
were both strong and numerous. In regard to
preference to unionists, after referring to the
arguments for and against, he says (p. 107): —
To an outside observer it would look as if the grievances
on both sides were exaggerated. It is doubtful if the
preference clause in an award works special hardship upon
the average employer in the administration of his business.
At least it was very hard to pin any employer interviewed
down to a concrete instance where it had done so ; and
even where this was possible, the hardship complained
was in no case so great as those frequently attending the
adjustment of relations between employers and unions in
America.
Dr. Clark also refers to our old friend, the
capitalist, who has been driven by these tyran-
nical laws to remove himself and his money to
another country (p. 149): —
Sometimes the statement is made that they (the
Arbitration laws) drive capital out of a country. No
specific instance was discovered by the writer where
money had been withdrawn from an industry because of
Labor legislation in any Australian State.
At pp. 160-161, Dr. Clark sums up his criticisms
of the Arbitration system :
Due stress has been laid upon the weak points in the
Arbitration laws of Australia in the above review. All
have not been enumerated, but the others are of
relatively minor importance . . . There are two kinds of
radical legislation, a kind that conquers attention and
demands support from the time it stands on the Statute
books, that becomes a question of vital interest, around
which parties rise and fall; and a kind that depends for
its existence on a momentary wave of moral enthusiasm.
The Arbitration laws of Australia seem to represent
the former class of laws. Their cen:ral principle, com-
pulsory State intervention to adjudicate serious industrial
disputes, promises to persist. They are reported to have
secured for the laborer a clear definition of his right to a
living wage, reasonable security against involuntary
interruption of employment by the caprice either of his
own leaders or of arbitrary employers, and to have
checked sweating’ in certain lines of manufacturing. Ihe.v
have also assured employers, in a great majority of
instances, though not in all, against a cessation of mdus-
trv by strikes. Business men have been able to take con-
tracts and make plans for future operations with this par-
ticular element of uncertainty left out. Above all—and
here may be the secret of the growing power of the Labor
party—the general public has not been worried or put to
inconvenience and loss by the industrial dissensions of
other people.
The Sydney Telegraph reviewer seems to have
been peculiarly unfortunate in overlooking, or. in
not having space for, any of these interesting
criticisms, and many others to a similar effect.
And that is just like the Telegraph’s luck.
Victoria’s Neglected. Lunatic.
Victoria’s newly-imported Inspector-General of
the Insane, Dr. Jones, having taken stock of the
State’s asylums, has handed Premier Bent a
report which scathingly condemns the neglect and
stupid meanness that have hitherto prevailed. The
report recommends an immediate expenditure of
£250,000 in putting things into decent order. Dr.
Jones finds that the weekly average cost of
patients is only 11s. 7d., ss. sd. of which goes in
salaries and wages, leaving but 6s. 2d. a week for
food, clothing, medical comforts, and necessaries.
(This is about the best recommendation for
“ thrift’’ a Tory Treasurer is ever likely to get—
but it is one that even Bent will scarcely boast of.)
The maintenance and repair funds have been
starved, consequently heavy outlay is now neces-
sary ; Ararat gaol ward should be closed alto-
gether ; Yarra Bend should be rebuilt from end to
end; Sunbury asylum should be enlarged; and
extensive alterations are imperative at Kew,
Ballarat and Beechlvorth. The existing asylums
are overcrowded to an astounding degree, having
600 patients more than there is proper accommo-
dation for. Additional assistants are urgently
needed —two more medical officers, two clerks,
two assistant matrons, two head attendants,
36 tradesmen and assistants of various sorts and
two ornamental gardeners. It is said that
Bent snorted when he read this last item, yet
capable gardeners, carpenters, etc., are probably
almost as efficacious in restoring sanity to the
afflicted as even the best medical officer on the
premises. Dr. Jones further animadverted on
the wastefulness, want of cleanliness and danger
of the wooden buildings that compose Yarra
Bend and some of the other institutions ; on the
utter lack of provision for epileptics and the sick
and infirm, while such things as observation
wards are non-existent; on the absence of any
provision for paying-patients; on the dearth of
comfortable ward accommodation —“ bare, com-
fortless barns, void of any object of interest that
could brighten the lives of the inmates.” The
crude arrangements for bathing patients and their
lavatory accommodation he describes as dis-
graceful, and much of it has been con-
demned again and again without any improvement
resulting. The kitchen, laundry and lighting ac-
commodation is unscientific and out-of-date, while
in every ward on a high floor the patients are in
danger of being burnt in such a holocaust as re-
cently occurred at one of the London County
Council asylums. The report is a bitter satire on
“financial reform’’of the Kyabram brand, and
it says plainly that Victoria has practically got to
build up and set going a complete, new system of
caring for and curing its insane. But it will cost
£250,000, and there is no immediate visible return.
Bent will probably bellow that there is no finan-
cial return whatever —but there is. Under a
scientific system — such as Dr. Jones was imported
to inaugurate—probably less than half the present
number of Victorian lunatics would need to be
cared for in the asylums. Senile patients could
be maintained in separate homes at even less
cost than at present; while the percentage of
cures could be raised 60 high that the whole cost
of the system need be no more, and would pro-
bably be less, than it is to-day. And in addition
Victoria would relieve itself of the stigma that,
once a man loses his reason, there is for lunuio
hope of cure, nor even of common comfort and de-
cency.

The Remnant of an Arbitration Act.
By three successive decisions the High Court has
practically abolished the N.S.W. Arbitration Act..
There is now hardly enough of that much-harried
legislation left to be worth worrying about, and
when the Caiuujtheks Government, which, for a
long time, reduced the Act to a state of catalepsy,
has done some further whittling away of the
powers of the court, the small remnant of the
Arbitration law will be invisible to the naked eye,
The decisions of the High Court have limited trie
effectiveness of the Arbitration Court m this
way :
(1) In the Clancy case, the right of the Court to
enforce early closing as the logical corollary of reasonable
hours of employment was denied. The Court could
declare that all employees in the butchering trade should
be released from duty at a certain hour, but could not
order the butchering shops to close at that hour, thus
the only effective means of enforcing the Court’s decision
was over-ruled. . .
(2) In the Lassetter case it was denied that the Arbitra-
tion Court had power to order a “ common rule” in any
industry on the basis of an amicable arrangement
between an employer and his employees—though the
proposal was first subjected to examination and objec-
tion in court by all the persons interested. Before there
could be a common rule there must be a dispute, not an
amicable agreement. In fact, peace was only to be
arranged on condition that there w r as a preliminary row,
and the only way to make peace was to have war.
(3) In the Trol'lymen’s case, the right of the Arbitration
Court to award preference to unionists was practically
destroyed.
The third decision, which is the most important,
calls for explanation. In the Trollymen’s case,
the Arbitration Court awarded preference to
unionists, and to make that award properly effec-
tive, ordered that employers should apprise the
union before making engagements, so that unionists
should have an equal chance with non-unionists in
applying (a previous decision enacted that the
“ preference ” could only be given to unionists
applying before, or at tbe same time with, non-
unionists). The High Court now says that it is
ultra vires to order an employer to apprise the
unions when he is in want of labor. Thus the
employer is left free to keep a register ox non-
unionists, and, by first apprising men on that
register of vacancies, to absolutely boycott
unionists. This may be good law, but it is very
poor sense, and it takes from the Arbitration Act
its keystone principle—which is to encourage the
workers to enter trades-unions, so that they may
collectively bargain and have a collective
responsibility for the keeping of the in-
dustrial peace. The High Court .took the
narrowest technical view of the case. A reason-
able mind would argue that since the Arbitration
Act gives the Arbitration Court power to grant
preference to unionists, consequently the Arbi-
tration Act gives the Arbitration Court power to
order all the necessary steps to make that prefer-
ence effective. But that is not the view of the
High Court. It insists that the Act should have
paraded and set forth all the administrative details
necessary to make a preference possible. Just as
reasonably it might be argued that a law against
stealing is operative only in regard to the
things it expressly mentions as not to be
stolen —that you mustn’t steal chairs, or eggs,
or hats if the law mentions them, but you may
steel hat-pins, bird-cages, and electric trams, if it
should happen that the Act didn’t include them
in its category, while balloons and stuffed croco-
diles, as things that the Act would almost certainly
forget to enumerate, would be anybody’s property.
The effect of the decision is to deal a vital blow at
the Arbitration Act. There is no reason why a
union should register under the Act when it gets
thereby only disabilities and no privileges. There
is no reason why any worker should join a union
registered under the Act. And there is every
reason why workers, if urged thereto by grievance,
should resort to the old disastrous remedy of the
strike and the riot. It is a bitter disappointment
to find the High Oourt of Australia* taking up tins
attitude in regard to Industrial Arbitration. Only
an unconscious bias towards the ideas of the rich
can explain its decisions—all legally defensible,
but all logically questionable.
«
The First Bulwark.
The case for Protection was, from the economic
view-point, as clear as possible in Australia so
soon as the falling-off in the gold rushes made
available a surplus of population, and faced the
continent with the problem of maintaining itself
without the aid of nuggets. There was then as
clear a certaintv as there is now that a flourishing
White Australia was only possible by the growth
of manufactures. But new political developments
have from time to time cmne forward to re-inforce
the economic argument in impressing upon Aus-
tralia the necessity of a self-reliant policy. Ihe latest
is the sudden upgrowth in the nortli of an aggressive
war-power which brings the Yellow Peril within
sight of this generation. The victorious Japanese
guns have thundered nothing more certainly than
a warning to Australia. The Russian has stood
in the path of the Mongol wave and been over-
whelmed. Australia may be the next to meet the
brunt; and most surely is towards the head of the
list of those who stand in the way of the new
warrior people, and must prepare to withstand
them or perish. The first necessary step of that
preparation is industrial rather than military
—the establishment of a local iron industry.
An iron industry would mean providing the
first essentials of war —the iron and steel
from which are made guns and ships, rail-
ways to carry troops and stores, locomo-
tives, and other essentials. Without iron-
works no nation could hope ta carry on
a modern war. With them- —carried to the point
at which the highest products of iron are evolved—
and with brave men, all things are possible. At the
outbreak of war the seas would probably be sealed
against imports. Even the obsolete and discarded
gun of the British Army could not be imported for
the Australian soldier. With iron and steel works,
and with our own iron ore deposits opened up,
and with the allied industries of gun foundries and
ship-building yards in full working order, and
with men, all the raw materials of defence are to
hand. The iron industry would provide the ma-
terial for arms, and also to some extent the men.
Australia imports now over £3,000,000 worth of
iron products a year, and that sum represents, in
the main, labor. The constituents of steel
are, in the rough, almost valueless, not
much higher up in the grade of worth than
road-metal. It is labor which gives them
price Iron ore is of so little value in situ that its
worth at the puddling furnace is very little more
than the cost of digging and handling. A highly-
finished product of iron ore, such as a watch-spring
or a knife-blade, is to be valued by the ounce. The

difference represents labor. If the Commonwealth
made locally, instead of importing, its £3,000,000
worth of iron goods, the money would be mostly
circulated in local wages—to miners, engineers,
and other artisans, and would give another large
class of recruits for the White Australian army, as
well as providing the army’s guns. A bonus and
tariff system, which will set up forthwith an Aus-
tralian iron industry, is essentially the first bul-
wark against the Yellow Peril, and every other
outside peril.

“ The Yeoman of the Guard ” is, from a
musical and story point of view, the best of Gilbert
and Sullivan’s great series of works. Its music is
worthy of grand opera (a pity that “grand opera”
is rarely so sensible); its dialogue has a poetic
quality suggestive in places of Shakspeare; but it
has not humor to anything like the degree of
“Pinafore” or “The Mikado;” and so it makes
great demands on the cast without helping the
actors with much material for raising an easy
laugh. “ The Yeoman,” to be satisfactorily inter-
preted, calls for a company equal to Yerdi’s works.
The “Repertoire C 0.,” which staged the piece at
Sydney Royal on Saturday night, has given some
charming revivals of Gilbert and Sullivan’s plays,
and the presentations have been as a rule ade-
quate ; but in this case the co. is hardly equal to
its task. The orchestra, under August Juncker,
and the chorus are perfect, illustrating again the
wide dissemination of musical talent among
Australians: but the principals in some instances
fail.
* » # *
Notable exceptions are Kenningham, who,
as Colonel Fairfax, sings like an angel and acts
almost a 3 well; and Miss Aggie Thorne, whose
Phoebe is distinguished by dainty acting and
sympathetic singing. Of course, too, the veteran
Howard Vernon scores as the gruesome gaoler.
But Miss Dolly Castles’ voice is not quite equal to
the part of Elsie Maynard, and the extremely
difficult part of Jack Point makes too heavy
demands on that promising junior, H. H. Wallace.
Notwithstanding, the revival is altogether wel-
come. There is enough of glee, song and concerted
music in “The Yeoman of the Guard” to
minimise individual deficiencies, and there has
been so much of the pitiful trash of musi-
cal comedy of late that a, Gilbert and
Sullivan show suggests coming out from
a George Reid meeting—where wit has been flailed
with a bladder of lard—to look at the moonshine
on a great expanse of water, or the shadows on a
great mountain, or the dancing tops of great trees,
or anything that isn’t fat and common and loudly
insistent and tin-kettly. Gilbert’s operas could
not be so badly played as to make them unattrac-
tive, and the Repertoire Co. never plays badly.
All that can be accused against it is that it ought
to play better.
** * *
“Naughty Nancy,” staged for the first
time in Sydney on Monday night, is made up of
many things, There is in it a school for girls—
called “Eden House.” A beautiful walled garden
in which beautiful school-girls of the magnetic
age congregate, a Gorgon lady principal named
Martha, a tubby little man masquerading in
female attire, much farcical music, a very attrac-
tive ballet, much jumble, in which the
story loses itself, and much comic work from
the orchestra when it imitates motor-car noises.
The night of washing day is an unusual one for a
first appearance, and suggests that the scenery
was being painted on Sunday, or that Mr. Sheri-
dan’s gowns hadn’t come home. However, at the
opening performance the paint seemed dry.
Miss Maud Amber didn’t carry away any of
the ancestral oaks on her white jewelled
frock, and Miss Watts-Phillips’ orange
wig was not exaggerated by taking up
the sunlight that frescoes the porch. And as
Mr. Sheridan’s skirts are of the kind that might
be borrowed off the nearest charwoman, the play
could hardly have been waiting for his begemmed
wardrobe to come home, so any delay may be
set down to Providence or Cussedness. In any
case, it doesn’t matter, but things that do matter,
like immortality and the National Debt, are so
much written about that it’s only fair to the
doesn’t-matters to give them a line occasionally.
Martha—doesn’t that name, for Scriptural
reasons, suggest the narrow things of the
house—is played by Miss Watts - Phillips,
and everything she does is well done. Mr.
Sheridan, who doubles the roles of Stiggs, a
company promoter, and Matilda Jones of the
Woman’s Rights Party, has only the memory of
his Widow O’Brien for rivalry. His lecture on
Bold, Bandy-legged, Bald-headed Man was
recognised on Monday as a funny old friend
of the audience, which gave it a glad hand,
and would willingly have asked the lecturer
out to look at a street hydrant. Miss Heba
Barlow, as Naughty Nancy, does her flirt-
ing, dancing and singing with elfish vivacity;
and a new-comer, Miss Waldon-Taylor, a Queens-
land girl with a pleasant voice and a good stage
appearance, plays another flirt’s part as Lady
Barbara Dawn. The impish Little Gulliver per-
vades the piece ; and the interpolation of a coon
serenade by Mr. Winfield Blake, and an imitation
of grand opera by this artist and Miss Maud
Amber, are things calculated to make glad
the public soul. A new bill, “The Earl and the
Girl,” is under rehearsal.
“When Other Lips and Other Hearts,”
&c., is the air that runs through “East Lynne”—
the play that is now lamenting at Sydney Palace.
It laments with the persistency of a spook haunt-
ing the bad man who murdered the solid part of
him and turned him loose in a cold, unfeeling
corridor and a damp cellar. Still, appreciative
audiences listen to it nightly as Miss Duggan,
in the capacity of Lady Isabel, sings it to
her husband, and when she has forgotten all about
it the orchestra fills in spaces with it, and the
damsel who rustles the paper bag says to her
friend, “ I think all the airs in ‘ Maritana ’ per-
fectly divine.” The tearful drama continues to
draw tears successfully, and the principals and
subordinates do their best with what is just a
dramatised Sob.
** * *
The four-leaved shamrock still flourishes
at Sydney Her Majesty’s, where Andrew Mack,
as Tom Moore, continues to show with what ease
and grace an Irishman can make love, and sing,
and jest in either rags or gorgeous trappings, and
stave off an angry landlady who wants the rint.
** * *
The man who interrupts a good story to
tell a better one is still the man in the large type
in the Tivoli bills. Fred. Bluett, Winton,
M'Ginty, Maud Beatty, Adson and Thorn, and
other people wear well, and continue to make a
show which never gets quite as high as Mt.
Everest, nor quite as low as G-. Reid’s spirits after
A. Deakin had made his Ballarat speech.

To-night Miss Jessie Maclachlan will make
Sydney Town Hall musical with ballads—mostly
Scotch. But she will also do justice to England
and Ireland; and ’cellist John McLinden will
appeal to foreign hearts with selections from

man announces further concerts for Thursday and

If “The Fires of St. John,” which met
with patient forbearance at Her Majesty’s (Melb.)
last Saturday night, was “presented with Elec-
trifying Success during Miss Nance O’Neil’s
Recent Triumphal Season in Boston, U.5.A.,” it
is the duty of all good Australians to feel sorry for
Boston. The translation of Sudermann’s play
that Miss Nance O’Neil presents may be a bald
translation, lacking certain suggestions of dim
debateable meanings that appealed to the Suder-
mann cult in the German original, but it is, one
supposes, at least a truthful statement of the plot.
The mechanism must be Sudermann’s, and judged
by its mechanism alone “ The Fires of St. John ” is
a pretentious piece of nonsense. A stream of small
talk flows sluggishly through the first act, bearing
on its bosom a note of interrogation. The audi-
ence is practically requested to wonder when the
story will begin. In the second act a drunken old
woman promises to cause trouble, but the pro-
mise remains unfulfilled. In the third act the
heavy father of the piece comes to high words
with his prospective son-in-law—and the alter-
cation ends in smoke. A drivelling pastor—the
“Magda” pastor, or his twin brother—hangs
around the proceedings, and “proposes” to the
heroine. She accepts him in the first place and
rejects him afterwards, nevertheless the parson is
a person of no more consequence than the casual
man-servant who comes along from time to time
with a muttered allusion to the drunken old
female or a joyous remark concerning beer.
* » * *
There are three characters in the story.
Melbourne has already met them a dozen times
under more entertaining circumstances. A colorless
girl is betrothed to a commonplace man, and her elder
sister (foster-sister in this play) unselfishly re-
frains from upsetting the arrangement. She
allows the colorless girl to go off with the man
whilst she—the self-sacrificer—strikes an appro-
priate attitude of despair. Curtain ! As a rule,
the three parties to this transaction are strictly
virtuous. The one claim to originality in Suder-
mann’s play lies in the misbehaviors of the elder
sister and the man. They are left together at
night in the same atmosphere of improbability—-
impossibility—which robbed the seduction scene
in Tolstoi’s “Resurrection ” of all critical human
interest. The elder sister seizes her chance to
show the gentleman how much she loves
him, and the scene is positively totter-
ing on the verge of impropriety, when a
great darkness comes to pass, and the drop curtain
falls upon the darkness. What happens in the
darkness has been previously symbolised by the
Fires of St. John, which are annual bonfires,
ihese misdemeanants enjoy a first annual bonfire
on the night before the man’s wedding, and next
morning they decide to let the marriage take place
as though nothing had happened. The tempestuous
spinster is willing to give her new lover to her
silly foster-sister instead of keeping him for her-
self. The lover, who is supposed to be a sturdy
independent fellow, consents to the double
sacrifice, and the wedding bells ring for Gertie.
* * * *
In apology for Sudermann’s play as pre-
sented by Miss Nance O’Neil and co. it may be
admitted that the tone of the performance, in its
serious moments, is highly unnatural. Miss
O Neil, as the gloomy, amorous elder sister, is
less unsatisfactory than the two new male actors
°f the co. M‘Kee Rankin is cheery, but some-
what indistinct, as an uneventful father, and the
lady who impersonates the heroine’s disreputable
mother may be commended for her shrieking off
the stage. When she talks (on the stage) the lad' v
is uncommendable. A revival of “Elizabeth”
will take place when “ The Fires ” go out, and in
thecharacter of the loud, red-haired monarch Miss
O Neil will be expected to settle the vexed
question as to whether she can talk as tremen-
dously as of yore.

‘ ‘ The Rose of the Riviera ” is just nowassist-
co‘ through a four weeks’ season
at Melb. Princess. Coming after “ Bill Adams ”
who never pretended to a definite form of mad-
ness, ‘Rose of Riviera” looks much the same
thing as a bona-fide musical comedy out on the
loose, and in the matter of simple “go”it com-
pares favorably with a motor car. Next Saturday
brings “The Skirt Dancer” to light again. A
week later the much-expected comedy season of
the Brough-Flemming Co. will commence with
“Beauty and The Barge.”

Bland Holt changes his bill at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, when the brown Hindu per-
son who has lately been figuring on the Royal
stage in “ Sporting Life, ” will undertake a more
serious job at Fitzgerald’s Circus building.
Bland’s forthcoming event is “The Flood Tide,”
a Drury Lane farcical drama that came in at the
tail end of his season last year, and was with-
drawn before its popularity had lost the bloom of
youth.
# * *
Hugo Heermann, the masterly violinist
who has stamped his name upon Melbourne’s
musical soul, will make his fourth and final appear-
ance at the Town Hall next Saturday night. Last
Saturday there were two Heermanns on the
platform, Emil, the clever son of Hugo, playing
second fiddle in a concerto and making a further
appearance on his own.

At the Opera House a capital novelty in
“ turns ” is provided by the silent performance of
The Modern Milo and Cruikshank the Carica-
turist. The Milo represents a series of shapely
stone goddesses on a pedestal, and every time a
goddess disappears the entertainment rests with
Cruikshank, who draws lightning caricature
portraits, which appear in magnified white strokes
against a dark background on a sheet. The
Gotham trio is another recent and bright item in
the Rickards show. Otherwise the programme
makes lavish announcements of Last Nights.

An Adelaide correspondent:—
“ The Walls of Jericho ” had eventually to be put on at
Adelaide Royal without Herbert Flemming. Brough took
the leading part of the man from Queensland who has
sickened of London in three or four years, his own part
(Cayley Brummie to the other’s Tanqueray) being handed
over to a fairly-good junior. This is a big loss. Brough,
as the rougher diamond, should be great. As the partly-
polished one he has a fine part, and plays it for all it is
worth. The play is going to be a big success in Australia,
where every patriotic citizen who sees it can thank Heaven
that he is not as these Londoners are. Sutro shows as a
born playwright still lacking in experience. He has a
great eye for stagecraft and for a telling situation.
The weak part of the play is its ending, two im-
portant points being thrown at the audience with-
out being adequately led up to. The play introduced
Beatrice Day, who had no part in “Beauty and the
Barge.” She is somewhat on GeraldineOlliffe lines, hand-
some, rather massive, soundly emotional, richly humorous,
altogether cut out for the part of the frivolous wife with
an affectionate disposition (towards the man from Queens-
land) underneath. The young people are chiefly Carter
Pickford and Winifred Fraser, who are both very good to
look upon. So far, they have done the light' work en-
trusted to them to perfection. Miss Temple has been
effective as two ladies of uncertain age. Mrs. Brough is
to be seen later, in “ Niobe ” or otherwise.

On the whole, Australasian banking profits were
rather smaller in the last 12 months for which figures
are now available than in the previous 12 months. Banks
took risks during- the drought, charged high rates, and,
as it happened, had then two good seasons to wipe the
risk out. The good seasons have now made people more
independent of the money-lender, and the money-lender’s
profits sag in consequence. The following summarises
the situation for the year :

The Bank of New Zealand disposed of its profits this
way:—£179,022 to the Assets Trust, to make good losses
incurred in the days before Ballanee and Seddon started
to save the country by doing the things which the Aus-
tralian Tory party says it would be disastrous to do;
£BO,OOO in interest on a £2,000,000 State loan, half of
which has now been put into the bank as capital; £12,500
to provide for various old losses; £513 to ordinary
reserves. The Australasia wrote off £39,000, the Union
£35,000, and the Commercial of Australia £15,521. The
Queensland National wrote off £19,645, repaid the State
£3OOO and private depositors £15,000. If other banks
wrote off anything, they charged the amount to profit
and loss, and wrote it off before showing profit.

The Bank of New Zealand figures for 1904-5 were recently
made available, but the Assets Board figures, which have
to be read with them, are not yet forthcoming, wherefore
the figures above are those for 1902-3 and 1903-4 respec-
tively. When this bank got into its mess in 1893-4, it
bailed up the State for £2,000,000, at 4 p.c. If that
ranked as capital, the institution would show a return
of £lO 18s. per cent. The Queensland National figures
stand high in the list for much the same reason. It
held £954,874 of non-interest-bearing fixed deposits
and 4* millions of very cheap fixed deposits. If
it paid ordinary interest it would show something
under 4 per cent. Banks which have increased their
dividends during the year are : National (Maoriland),
from 10 to 12 p.c.; National (Tasmania"), sto 6 ; Ballarat,
6to 7. The City of Sydney has cut down its div. from 4
to 2* p.c. The A.J.S., whose figures show a great change,
has written down its capital from £1,168,042 to £154,528.
The Aust. Deposit and Mortgage, of Melbourne, has also
had a long-deferred cleaning-up, writing capital down
from £909,979 to £198,946. On the new capital the profit
would represent £2 19s. 6d. per cent.
The following shows the percentage of the profits
which were paid in dividends, the balance being put to
reserves or, in some few cases, to writing-down securities
or paying off old debts :

The London was thus the only bank which paid away
more than it earned, trenched on its reserves, and thus
reduced its own future earning' power. The size of the
distribution ought, no doubt, to be considered partly in
the light of existing reserves, which are shown in a pre-
vious table. In most cases it will be found that the worst
offenders in the way of excessive dividends are those
which have the poorest reserves. The last half-dozen,
anyway, are in that category. Considering the
size of their reserves, the bright examples are the
National (Maoriland) and the Westralia ; though, as these
two nevertheless pay the largest dividends in the list,
their position seems to be mainly due to the extraordinary
prosperity of Maoriland and Westralia.

The position of the A.J.S., read in conjunction with in-
terest earnings, suggests that there is still a very heavy
dead-weight on the books. Certainly, though it has this
vast amount of deposits compared with shareholders’
funds, the non-interest-bearing deposits are very small;
but, taken as a whole, the figures mean that the securities
are so poor that they can barely earn their own interest.
All new business in this bank is, however, fully
protected. The position of the Q.N. is some-
what the same. The London, though it stands high
in this list, and ought, therefore, to earn large profits if

its securities are good, is handicapped by having to pay
an excessive rate of interest on the bulk of its deposits.
In other words, though it has a very large amountofthe
public’s money, it has agreed to pay so much for t that
there is little profit for itself in the handling. Taking the
Commercial of Sydney as a datum point, the banks which
work on a smaller proportion of the publics money and
vet show a larger profit are the Adelaide, Westralia, Royal
(Melb.), Colonial (Melb.), Commercial of Tasmania, and
Australasia. As for the Commercial < of I Sydney itseH, it
could probably show up much better if it not aim at
something approaching impregnability-itmaintains
liauid assets no less than £5,629,486, or very
nearly 50 per cent, of the total deposits. _ On
the other hand, the Westralian Bank’s positions unique,
more than two-thirds of its deposits bem non-
interest bearing; and a considerable amount o this is
apparently put to very profitable use. But if it is a pretty
large advantage in ordinary times to have the handling o
the public’s money, when the slump comes ttiere^ is some-
thing to be said on the other side. When that happens,
the larger the proportion of shareholders funds in the
business the better for both shareholders and depositors,
as the history of, say, the Bank of Australasia in the last
17 years shows by comparison with that of, say, tne oom-
mercial of Australia for the Same period.

The ordinary dividend of 10 per cent, is paid, with a bonus
of Is. per share on the 20,000 shares of 10s. each. On
capital and reserves the earnings were at the extra-fine
rate of £l7 2s. lOd per cent, per annum ; there
are only two other Australasian trustee offices in
that class. In three years the return on funds has
doubled, and in five years it has nearly trebled,
and the improvement has been mainly through com-
missions. The trust accounts on hand amount to only
£249,053, a twofold increase in three years. Still, m spite
of the fact that some of the Westralian charges are a bit
higher than the corresponding charges on this side, the
trustee business must be helped along very considerably
by the profitable agent-for-absentee business which
flourishes in the absentee-ridden West. The co.’s invest-
ments are mainly premises (£12,963), mortgages (£2150),
and cash (£4220), and the whole of these lumped together
seem to be yielding something over 8 per cent. The co.
isn’t building up its reserves very fast; but so far as they
go they seem a solid lot on which to hang a trust or a
power of attorney. # # »

N.S. Wales and Victoria (J per cent, rise) have anti-Labor
Governments ; Queensland (2 per cent, rise) has a half-
Labor Government, Westralia (3 per cent, rise) has a whole
Labor Government. That’s Cohen’s practical answer to
the wild yarn that foreign investors look with alarm and
dread upon the progress of the “ Socialistic ” party in
Australia.
* • * *
Some elaborate ass, in drawing up a recent
mortgage in Sydney, is alleged to have made careful pre-
paration for a new slander on the Labor party by getting a
clause inserted which laid down that the mortgage was
not to be paid off in debased currency. Then a conveni-
ent friend wrote wildly to the Sydney dailies the very day
the document was signed, to ask if this was another evi-
dence of the popular alarm at the “trend of Socialistic
legislation,” or some such sloppy verbiage—the Tory is
dreadfully fond of “trend.” The S.M. Herald, which
has been speaking reproachfully of late about “Slanders
on Australia,” gave publicity to the childish conspiracy in
its columns, and said with the gravity of an owl that it
“ hoped the fears that prompted the insertion of such a
clause were ungrounded.” Yet even the Herald must
surely have sense enough to know that it is 10,000 to 1
there were no “ fears ” in the case, and that the
clause was merely put in that it might be published
as another sham evidence of how the Labor party was
terrorising capital. It was obviously of no earthly use,
except as a silly joke of that sort. Such a proviso can
give no protection to anybody, for if George Reid’s
Government, or any other Government, debases the
coin, it will naturally enact that the debased coin
shall be accepted as ‘full legal tender, and that all
documents to the contrary shall be null and void.
The man who sent in the fearful news said that the clause
was inserted by “ a well-known firm of solicitors. If he
had really wanted to know whether it was “ the outcome
of the Socialistic craze,” he would, presumably, have asked
the “well-known solicitors,” seeing that the}'were the
persons who had the information —not the Herald.
Possibly, however, the reason why he didn’t ask the
“ well-known solicitors ” was that neither they nor the
alleged clause had any existence.

Capital is now £12,911; on that and reserves profits show £lO
14s. per cent, per annum. The assets consist almost wholly
of pledges, stock (partly at valuation, partly at cost), and
interest at valuation, these items being lumped at
£18,643. Though profits show a very fine return, the
real position depends largely upon whether sufficient
allowance is made for the moth that eats holes in the
dress-coat, and the rust that shows through the plate of
the presentation cruet. The co., besides its own capital,
has £7034 of deposits—figures which don’t show much
variation from those of recent years.

In addition to the profit made in the past year as
shown above, £2500 has been set aside “ for repairs to
business premises ** \ this is in addition to £3073 written
off. For the present this £2500 appears as a sort of extra
reserve, though it isn’t shown in the table, because it
most likely represents depreciation which has already
occurred. The accounts disclose very tew striking move-
ments tor the year; the most striking is in the matter of
profits, and that appears to be due to increased wool
business. Liabilities are practically unaltered; and the
chief movement on the other side is a reduction of
advances, with a corresponding increase of cash. The
position compares with that of 10 years and 12 months
ago respectively :

After paying interest on debenture stock a profit remains
at the rate of £3 2s. sd. p.c. on shareholders’ capital; and
a few years ago it didn’t look as though anything like
that was going to happen. But, even if the whole of the
present profit is sent on to the “ primary ” reserve, the
latter will still be a good way off the minimum size ac
which the last reconstruction provided that dividends
may be paid. This reserve must first reach £75,000 before
shareholders get anything ; after that 25 p.c. of profits
have to go to a secondary reserve, the £75,000 has to be
maintained, and then the shareholders may get 3 p.c. ; if
anything 1 is left the “ B ” debenture stockholders take
1 p.c., and it takes £7277 to pay 1 p.c. on that stock. The
chance of shareholders getting 3 p.c. isn’t, then, very im-
mediate, and the chance of their getting more than 3 p.c.
is horribly remote. But, even so, the shareholders might
have done worse. Some of them, were let out of a huge
liability, and, from one point of view, that was equal to a
huge dividend, paid at the expense of people who didn t
stand to make the very large profits that shareholders at
one time stood to make.

This is one of those “ tariff-fed monopolies” that the
Freetrade papers talk about, though it isn’t a monopoly,
and though nobody has observed any increase m the
price of salt since the tariff began to help it. While the
tariff was new the co. did pretty well, until the importer
got his breath; then he discovered that he could sell
salt a good deal cheaper than he had been doing
(in other words, the public hadn’t, under Freetrade,
been getting goods at alleged “Freetrade prices”).
Instead, therefore, of putting up prices under Protec-
tion, he began to lower them : as the co. reports, com-
petition from abroad has been keener, and selling prices
have, consequently, been depressed, so as to make profit
somewhat less than that of last year.” On capital and
reserves, the net profit showed a return of £6 18s. 6d.
p c • and even then it isn’t certain that enough has been
written off plant, &c., which in this business perishes at
an appalling rate. In the past five years shareholders
have averaged 4f- p.c., which can hardly be called bloated-
monopoly figures ; and it is obvious from the trend of the
figures that the present div. is not justified. During the
year the co. has reduced its overdraft and current debts
from £13,035 to £10,390, mainly by reducing stocks ; and
that is one satisfactory feature, anyhow. The assets in-
clude a goodwill item of unknown size, lumped with all
the rest: and there isn’t any evidence that this paper
asset is being got rid of. While it is there, the reserves
can only be regarded as nominal.

The black Labor party is notoriously unscrupu-
lous as to its facts. The last report of the Victorian
Mines Department, after giving instances of Victorian
mines that are paying dividends on averages of ljdwt.,
3dwt., and 4dwt., says : “In view of such facts, comment
on the absurdity of the following in the January number
of the Review or Reviews is needless * In Australia,
where gold is a white man’s industry, ore that does not
yield an ounce to the ton is hardly worth mining. In the
Rand, with cheap coal and cheap labor, they can work
ore at a profit when it.yields only 9dwt. to the ton.’”

But the reserves have to some extent a suspicious
look, and the profit shown above doesn’t seem the
best sort of profit either. The co. has a “Replace-
ment and Reparation Fund,” which now stands at £7055,
and is included in the reserves shown above. Apparently
this is intended to buy a new wash-jug when the cracked
handle comes off finally ; and if the jug is cracked already
the fund is really of the nature of a writing-off. While this
reflects upon the reserves to the extent of £7055, it also
reflects upon the past year’s profits to the extent of £1059,
latter being the amount added to the Fund out of profits.
This addition is at the rate of about 5 per cent, on the
book-value of the furniture ; and a 5 per cent, writing-off
from the book-value of hotel furniture doesn’t look exces-
sive, even though it does cut net profits down from £2OlB
to £959. Latter on capital alone is at the rate of £3 2s.
per cent. ; and if the figures are no better than that, it
doesn’t look as though any of the reserves are very real.
The co.’s freehold is down in the balance-sheet for
£102,990 : this carries a load of £62,000 of debt, apparently
at 4 per cent, or a trifle less—a huge load, more than twice
as large as the capital, notwithstanding that it is being
steadily but slowly reduced.

The “London syndicate” which, since Lionel
Robinson took a train-load of brokers and speculators to
Broken Hill, has been haunting Barrier mining co.s’
offices with offers and options bulging out of its pockets,
has now secured a call on Round Hill. It proposes to
form a new co., in 200,000 shares of £1 each, and put up
£30,000 as working capital. Present owners are a small
syndicate, which has been pottering about for a few
months ; before that the big hungry-looking hill had been
lyin"- idle for 13 years, held under that blastiferous title,
mineral conditional purchase. It is described as being
“at Broken Hillbut, so far as prospecting has shown,
it has no connection with the Broken Hill lode. Silver
and lead can be got in it in numerous veins and streaks,
just as they can be got in 200 other hills on the Barrier,
and whether there is any more metal in this hill
than in the 200 others is at least doubtful. The whole
thing is pure gamble, with the chances largely against
anything profitable. There will, however, be enough
metal to string on the plungers and make an occasional
market with. Even in the old days some people managed
to make money out of Round Hill.

Broken Hill Junction North is still in diffi-
culties. Manager Stockdale has resigned, unable to get
along with the local directors, whom he accuses of inter-
ferino- too far in the working of the mine. Present inten-
tion is to put anything up to 800 tons through the mill
weekly. This quantity can, no doubt, be supplied, but a
good part of it will be found to be refractory rhodonite
stuff, and costs will be high and extraction low.

Barrier stocks have, with one or two exceptions,
had big jumps lately. Share dealers will have to look
out; for the movement has been made, not by the mines,
but by the market. , * ,

ceived from smelters) has been:—l9oo, £9125 ; 1901,
£11,000; 1902, £18,373 ; 1903, £18,304; 1904, £32,068.
The Yarranderie (formerly Hilder’s) is the busiest show,
owned by a Sydney co.; capital, £8437, in 6000 shares
paid to £1 and 5000 now paid to 13s. 9d. Calls are being
made on latter shares, and the money put on fixed
deposit, which at date of last balance (Oct., 1904)
amounted to £1405. In 1902 co. paid 2s. in divs., in 1903
another 2s. Last year six divs. were paid, amounting to
4s. 3d. per share —which is the best showing of any Aus-
tralian co.-owned silver mine for the year, taking paid
capital into account. Next best-known mine on the field
is J. V. Bartlett’s; owner is supposed to be making a
nice dry bit out of it. Still, with communication so
bad and costly, the field can’t be worked in the most
desirable way, and a lot of picking is done. The veins
lend themselves to this sort of thing; they are very
irregular, both as to size and quality. Richest portion is
fine-grained galena, lying close to bands of quartz, where
small bunches of native silver are occasionally found.
Last) year’s output from the whole field averaged just
upon 3dwt. gold and 70oz. silver per ton and 12 per cent,
lead ; but on account of the picking, this gives no true
idea of the general value of the lodes. A good deal of
prospecting is being done in the district, which seems
well worth it.

J. Bull’s Scottish-Australian Co., which owns
the Lambton and Burwood mines, Newcastle (N.S.W.), is
having a pretty cold time now. It used to pay 10 to 20
per cent., but in 1903 it paid only 3 per cent., and last
year only at the rate of 2J per cent, for the first half, and
nothing at all in the second, when it showed a loss of
£4545. Directors’ report, of course, blames labor-costs
chiefly—“ wages remained at the level fixed when the
value of coal was considerably higher ”; and, if market
conditions don’t improve, one of two things must happen
—either the miners must take lower wages, or the mines
must shut up, when miners will take no wages at all.
And there is only one certain way to improve market
conditions, and that is by improving the Australian
demand. Australia can’t make certain of improving
the foreign demand, simply because it can’t control
the foreign supply; but it can enormously increase
the Australian demand by smelting here the iron which
at present is smelted in foreign parts, and building the
machinery here that is now built in foreign forges ; and
making here the cottons, woollens and silks that our
people now get from foreign parts. It can do that in one
act by putting up the tariff on all manufactured goods.
If Australia doesn’t commit itself to that, then there
seems no hope for the Newcastle miner except either
lower wages or no wages at all. Nothing is more certain,
anyway, than that a co. won’t continue making 1J per
cent, one half-year, nothing at all the next, and a loss of
£4545 the third.

Re the cancelling of the Mousetrap lease,
Wyalong (N.S.W.). The Warden’s report, before the
cancellation, affirmed that prior to a contract being put in
hand for sinking a main shaft, some three months ago,
the property was worked, or rather scratched, on the sur-
face by a number of old-age pensioners. If true, quite a
new way of complying with labor^covenants.^
Latest return from Hidden Secret, Kalgoorlie,
shows 7130 z. gold and 29580 z. silver from 91 tons. Total
to date, 78330 z. gold and 34,9820 z. silver from 475 tons ;
dividends, £30,000 odd. Winze .below 200 ft. is on very
rich ore, with some splendid specimens of telluride. Pipe
of rich ore is still going down, and may yield a lot of
stone yet.

South Kalgurli (W.A.) treatment plant has had
a trial run, but it looks as if a more powerful motor
will have to be installed before plant can be run success-
fully. If difficulty can be overcome, co. should treat
4500 tons monthly for 2000 odd ounces.
# * * *
Ingliston Consols, Meekatharra (W.A.), has re-
turned 1021 oz. from 339 tons ; total to date, 33180 z. from
878 tons. This is one of those rich outback shows which
usually are only comets of a season. But this may have
a longer life.

Westralia Waihi is again looking “ dicky.” For
March, co. made a profit of £2OO, for April £lOO ; for May
there is a loss of £lOO. This means calls to explore pro-
perty at depth of 280 ft. Outlook is anything but hopeful,
and future of co. depends on how new east reef pans out.
Even manager Watts can’t make a gold-mine out of a
diorite hill.
* * * *
North Kalgurli (W.A.) can hardly be expected
to go on much longer. May return showed a loss of £lOO,
in spite of 1000 tons gold slimes, returning 4dwt., being
included. Without these slimes yield would drop to about
235. 6d. a ton, against costs of 315., showing a dead loss of
7s. 6d. a ton, or, say, £5OO to £6OO a month. Co. is said
to have £15,000 cash in hand, but, even so, outlook is
gloomy unless a fresh property can be secured.
Hannan’s Star, Kalgoorlie, seems going from
bad to worse, and treatment plant may shortly close down.
During past three months average yield has been 7'3, 5-6,
and 4 ; 9dwt., showing £3OO profit, £lOO profit, and £5OO loss.
This sort of thing can’t go on indefinitely. Better things
are hoped for in Morrison’s lode, but that will-o’-the-wisp
has been sought for for over five years fruitlessly, and
there seems no reason to hope that good ore will be found
now.

South New Moon, Bendigo, has dropped from
the pinnacle it occupied, and is now below the New
Moon. But there is no fear of it petering out to the ex-
tent the Queen Cross Reef did at Charters Towers, as it
has big ore reserves. What has happened is that the
grade of stone has got down, and divs. are not likely to be
so high as during the early part of the past 12 months.
New Moon has come out with a 4s. div., but such
disbursements must be regarded as exceptional.
South New Moon has paid in _ all £357,000, or
£ll 3s. 6d. per share. Stone is coming from
500, 580, 980, 1060, 1140, and 1220 feet levels.
What is termed a fine lot of quartz remains at the two
first-named levels, and there are big blocks of stone above
the others. Costs last half-year ran into 17s. per ton,
of which 11s. went for wages and 2s. 6d. for battery treat-
ment. Co. has shaft down to 1500 ft., and is about to go
down another 100 ft. to prospect at 1480 and 1580 ft.
* * * *
Specks of gold have been seen in a new make of
quartz in New Chum Railway mine, Bendigo, at 4200 ft.
This is a little deeper than where co. previously alighted
on a little quartz and a few colors. So down the winze is
to go again, and another crosscut put out to see if the
mine is on to golden stone at last. It is hot work in the
bottom, and there isn’t much to boast about in working
there, even though there may be the honor of sweating at
the deepest point in any of the world’s gold mines.
It is all very nice for Mr. T. Lees-Field, member
of the London board of the Victorian Cornish, Daylesford,
to pipe a lay to Vic. shareholders, who want their
balance-sheets, about shortness of cash and reconstruc-
tion. There has been plenty of time to issue a statement
that would have satisfied all. Worst omission was to
carry through re-organisation without submitting details
to the local holders. Lees-Field—beautiful name—kindly
says that every penny earned is carried to the credit of
the co. That is not the point. What shareholders want
to know is how the money go;
• * * *
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) h within a stride of making
up the total of £2,000,00C .n dividends, as the July pay-
ment will put the aggre r vte above that sum. Nearly all
the money has been app; jpriated in Tassy among a little
cluster of identities who have never shown that they
deserved their luck. By a s'..r.?ak of fortune the surveyors
cut Mt. Bischoff out of the original survey of the Van
Diemen’s Land Co.’s property thinking the hill was only
a barren block of ground. T,.vs. began in Jan., 1878, and
have gone on steadily until now. It is fair to say that
the mine has seen its best-, and he would be bold who
would allege that it has the present market value
of scrip in sight. Yield of tin so far is about 43,000 tons,
of the value of £3,886,000. Divs. have ranged between
ss. and 30s. monthly, with, of late, a tendency towards
the lower amount.

No great cheer is to be derived from the reading
of the Briseis yearly report. It is so brutally frank as to
confound some of the Melbourne bull crowd, who can’t
understand why everything should be told. Thus it is
related that a slice of the heavy basalt on the Briseis Hill
has subsided, owing to the collapse of the Brothers No. 1
underground workings. In plain English, this means that
in the old days a big hole was made in the drift
by the miners, and it is just this fly in the No. 1
ointment that spoils its virtue. Figures in Lindsay
Clarke’s report demonstrates how tremendously out were
the original Stock Exchange puffers of the Briseis. Thus
the general average for the year was only sJlb. per cub.
yd. , instead of the predicted 1 per cent. Even the bottom
at the No. 1 Ringarooma face only went lOflb., while In
the east end the lower drifts stopped at lb. No. 2on
the other hand only averaged 8-841 b. and No. 3 face
1'221b., while at the Briseis Hill 31b. was not reached. It
looks more than ever as if the average would be what
Hawley mentioned in his later reports—about 51b.
Good points about the show are that the bulk of the
rocky overburden is gone, that 51b. will pay handsomely,
that co.'s water scheme gives it control of the North
Ringarooma, and that the basin under the hill at the
south end is widening while the drift yields well. Still
600,000 shares are a stunning lot on which to pay divs.

Contractor George C. Willcocks’ mining enter-

His syndicate-cwra-Government exploration work at Clon-
curry is reported to move satisfactorily, and the proposi-
tion is to be inspected by Weinberg. Willcocks’ en-
thusiasm, however, reaches high-water mark when he
says that “ Me. Garnet will be heard of before long.” He
proposes to tackle the mine again in a couple of months
with a drill. Considering the money his firm sank in the
Mt. Garnet railway, exploration with drill is perhaps ad-
visable as a last chance. But Willcocks’ seems quite
haDPV about it. He certainly deserves success.

placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate

article contributed to the March number of the Chamber
of Mines Journal, W.A., gives particulars of the savings
made, and states that the introduction of the Wilfley
Slime Table will be of great service in treating the low-
grade sulphide ores of the field. Since the future of #
Kalgoorlie is so intimately bound up with the most
economical solution of this sulphide problem, this
assurance from Mr. Brett is a most important matter.

REVERENCE.
LITTLE GIRN (first visit to church):
"What's that silly old man in his nightey
for?”
LITTLE BOY (who has had lessons in theology):
“ Hush, baby I that’s the Almighty."
Edward Langton, chairman of Melbourne
.Public Library trustees, lately told what he
doubtless thought a good “ red-tape ” yarn. The
trustees wanted an assistant to the sailorman who
cleans the skylights, and had chosen an outsider,
when the Public Service Board vetoed him and
sent a man who was properly qualified by exam-
ination, but otherwise as useless as a child. He
immediately tumbled from aloft and was killed.
It wasn t a bad tale, for Langton, but it turned
out that some one had been pulling that regrettable
person s leg, for the assistant sent by the Board
had done his work all right, and was still doing it,

Empire Day ? I enjoyed it immensely. The
school procession passed down our street. At the
Japanese laundry they had two flags up, the
Union Jack and the IVTonkey Banner entwined.
Ihe whole staff stood inside and smiled. The
European laundry opposite made no display
because the woman who used to run it was away
trying to collect the money owing to her by the
™ s ! .who had deserted her in favor of the Japs,
and her late staff was away trying to get another
job. As the procession passed the vegetable and
fruit shop, the Chow proprietor came outside and
said “Welly good ” three distinct times. At the
corner there was a slight check caused by an en-
thusiastic German and a drunken Dago sailor, who
had fallen out of the Italian wine shop and were
fighting in the road. But it was a great day. I
felt that the silken bonds had been drawn close.
In fact, if they had been drawn any closer and the
top end of them had been tied to a tree, I would
have been hanged.

The bridegroom seems to have been so
small an incident in a Melbourne fashionable
wedding the other day that the Australasian
overlooked him altogether. It traced the pedi-
gree of the bride, and mentioned her clothes
down to the last 3in. of chiffon, then surveyed
the bridesmaids, and went into particulars
regarding the “best man,” and the wedding
presents right through to a pair of salt cellars and
a candlestickbut the bridegroom was the mere
speck in the distance that escaped notice.

“ Edyson ” : Seeing that the churches (the
.R 0. church in particular) insist that marriage is
purely a celestial business which no mundane
power can abrogate, isn’t it
up to the people to point out
to parson and priest that it
is incumbent on them to
make no more bad marriages ?
The ghostly person in the
cataract of black gown de-
clares that the marriage he
makes is ir-
revocable,
that it is
holy, that it
cannot b e
undone;
and yet he
is ready,
practically
at a mo-
ment’s no-
tice, to tie-
up, for a
small cash
considera-
tion, any
Jack and Jill,
quite regardless
of Jack’s suita-
bility for Jill or
Jill’s affinity for
Jack. Since the
reverend’s work
is everlasting and
no man may
undo it, the pul-
piteer who off-
handedly throws
together, for
ready money, two
people who are
often total strangers
, him, is a maker of
mischief and misery. Also
he is quite too casual; the
divorce court takes its eud of
the job much more seriously.
The conscientious parson who believes there is in
the eye of Heaven no escape from the marriages
he makes should make no marriages without
having first put forth every effort in his power to
satisfy himself that the couple will be a perfect
match, but so far all the parsons I have come in
contact with have been reckless promoters of
weddings quite regardless of consequences. If
marriages are made in heaven I am convinced it is
bad policy to have the fees paid on earth.

Judge Backhouse, two barristers, and two
solictors were engaged in Sydney District Court
!u te i y «° Ver a ten shlllln £ dispute. Counsel said
tha,t important points were involved,” and the
Judge retorted that the smaller the claim the
more important the points. The legal profession
has always a craving to settle some important

THE GLAMOR OF THE UNIFORM.
CITIZEN (bitterly): “ Onst I teas her only love; but a pore bloke’s got no show with the
women when these military’s about.”
. The Mayor of Huddersfield (Eng.) has
impressed on his council the desirableness of
giving some Socialistic aid to the rearing of the
local infant. As a start, he personally offers £1 to
every youngster born, and reared to the age of 12
months, m the district he represents. The Council
« capped this by adopting a scheme whereby a
shilling is offered the person who first notifies the
council of any birth within 48 hours. Having
thus located the new infant, the health officer is to
call on it, and give the parents detailed advice
regarding its rearing. Two lady health officers
are also to be appointed, and will visit whenever a
birth occurs, and instruct the mother in proper
nursing, &c. The scheme culminates with the
establishment of a day nursery as a experiment,
and the distribution of special milk to infants
under 12 months old. If anyone suggested that
Sydney Council should appoint medical officers to
see that its possible citizens weren’t lost by their
parents’ ignorance or neglect, M‘Linen would rave
to the point of bursting.

The best news this week is that the row
over the true meaning of Socialism has been
settled. ‘Socialism,” said the chairman of the
great anti-Socialist demonstration ” at Dubbo
(™ .‘demonstration” consisted of 11 people)—
Socialism means that every man is to have an
acre of land in the State.” He remarked that he
hacln t thought over the subject at all till he was
going to the meeting that night; then, in a flash,
he saw the absurdity of giving everybody an acre
of ground, because somebody would get his acre
m Sydney while another person would have to put
up with an acre at the back of Tibooburra ; where*
upon he had decided to hurry along and say some-
thing very severe about Watson. Before he sit
down he expressed deep regret that other people
didn t think the thing out for themselves. But
Heaven knows why they should, when thev can
get everything thought out for them like this—
great thoughts, and an acre into the bargain. And
at this rate, before Socialism can really come
about there wifi have to be 198,848,200 people in
1,902,660,240 people in the Common-
wealth. lor presumably you can’t have a cast-iron
rule of one acre to each person without having one
person to each acre.

A Melbourne pressman writes :
The murder of Constable Johnston at St. Kilda, nearly
three years ago, was followed by a public subscription on
behalf of Mrs. Johnston and her children. About £l6O
was raised for widow Johnston by her sympathisers, and
thus far she is nothing- the richer for it. A few other
pounds remitted to a newspaper were duly handed over
to her, but that was a separate matter. She has not re-
ceived even an official account of the £l6O, and when she
applies to leading members of the committee she gets the
impression that she is regarded as a nuisance. The
reason given for withholding the subscription is that it
was got together to provide her with a home, and as it is
not sufficient to buy a habitable house, nothing can be
C|ol ?. < ;\, J'' lemone .V is to remain at compound interest
until it tote up to the price of a desirable villa residence,
Mrs. Johnston will be a good many years older ere she
begins to live rent free.
High police officials in Melbourne have
been endeavoring to introduce the system which
led to the undoing of Ko-lco in “The Mikado”—
she person whose office was threatened because of
insufficiency of executions. A constable on traffic
duty was called upon to explain why he prose-
cuted so few people for breach of regulations, and
—? explanation, that he endeavored to so run
things that the regulations wouldn’t be breached,
wa3 deemed insufficient. There was apparently
no evidence that furious driving or any other sin
wa,s going on, but the authorities held that the
policeman should summon somebody, whether
anybody deserved it or not, in order to justify hi 3
existence. He was just on the point of being
reduced to street duty when Chief-Secretary
Cillott interfered. As a matter of fact, the worst
blocks m Melbourne streets are caused by frantic
policemen stopping a long string of vehicles while
they take the name of some driver suspected of
breathing on the wrong side of the street.

George Willis, the clerk who committed
suicide at Watson’s Bay, Sydney, will probably
serve as a text for the dreary temperance lecturer
for many a day. “ Died merrily—drunk as a
fiddle,” was the written message he left behind
him. Then lie took arsenic, and made things
doubly sure with a pistol, and after that his corpse
sat out on the rock all night and froze by way of a
further guarantee of its deadness. Yet a fiddle is
a sober implement, and if a man is no drunker
than that there is very little to complain of.
OELIMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gelimer, King of the Vandals,
In mountain-prison pent,
To Pharas, the Roman captain,
A message of sorrow sent.
He had been Lord of Carthage,
The splendid Daughter of Tyre,
And he wrote thus—“ Send me, O Pharas,
A loaf of bread and a lyre.”
He would comfort his heart that stifled
’Midst Moorish swine in a stye,
By singing of Genseric’s glories,
And his own good days gone by.
Gelimer, King of the Vandals,
Died in the ancient years ;
Yet his words so quaint and simple
Have filled mine eyes with tears.
And I think I will send this message,
His case being nearly mine—
“ I have a lyre—but send me
A loaf and a jar of wine.”

ARNOLD’S BALSAM.— A pure vegetable
extract. The peculiar process followed in the
manufacture of this important cough mixture
ensures the extraction of all the Balsamic and
active medicinal principles of the plants, roots,
and herbs employed. Its remarkable curative
properties have induced many eminent medical
men to order it with approbation. It may be
safely taken in any stage of chest affections, and,
having a pleasant taste, is readily administered to
children. A dose at bed-time will ensure repose.
Bor families in the country, distant from a phy-
sician, it is invaluable, as, by its early use, many a
severe chest attack may be warded off. Children
are peculiarly susceptible to its gentle influence.
Get Arnold’s Balsam. All the best chemists and
stores throughout the States sell Arnold s Balsam,
It has the largest sale of any cough mixture.

Adelaide crematorium is having a long
rest, and for a year or more no one has evinced a
desire to frizzle his dear departed friend there into
fuller’s earth. At first the frying establishment
threatened to become fashionable, but in spite of
the efforts of certain doctors, who died and gave
the place a leg-up with their patronage the ten-
dency to cremation seems to have died out. x et,
as a method of disposing of the dead, it is clean,
healthy, in no way repugnant to the feelings, and
costs only £5. But cremation has to struggle against
ages of prejudice, fostered by tear-sodden literature
about how little Henry loved to visit his mother s
grave, by tales about “ the quiet God s acre,
and the yew-tree and the cypress therein, and by
creepy tales, like long sad caterpillars on the spine,
about ghosts, and body-snatchers, and corpse
lights, and things that sit on tombstones and
mo-e-o-o-o-o-oan. Then there is the opposition of
gravediggers, undertakers, mutes, cemetery trus-
tees, parsons, and weepy people who l°ye °
linger in the place of worms and spell out the
saddening inscription “ Sacred to the Memory o
J. Briggs.” So cremation has to skirmish on a
steep gradient.

A Paris newspaper has got off this re-
markable confusion of ideas: —
Athletics are carried to peculiar lengths in the British
colonies. Should the Australian cricket eleven now
landing in Maoriland, win the majority of the cricket
tournaments, every member could, on his
State employment at a large salary; but funding
of all, MrlG. Beid, the Australian Premier, is coming over
to swim from Dover to Calais.
If that misguided Parisian paper only knew the
amazing George it wouldn’t discuss the matter so
calmly. A two-headed statesman landing on
Calais sands, and saying “Oui” with one head and
“Non ” with the other, would be the most start-
ling invasion thereabouts, since the days w en
Louis Napoleon came ashore at Boulogne with, a
tame eagle on his shoulder and a bit of ham m
his hat.

“ S.S.” : Cookery classes have been estab-

in Melbourne, and in the other centres too,
I presume, and I suppose that in the other
centres the fat man is as busy as he is in
the metropolis turning the circumstance to
his own
stomach’s ad-
vantage. The
fair, round
man who is
something of

is generally a
busy eater.
He is ever in
quest of free

dinners, and
free teas, and
the State

ery classes

to fill his
aching va-
cancy for

read of the enthusiasm ex-

over the surprising success
of the little students. But
it is not impressed upon
you that the Mayor and
his stout cronies have
waded through a big four-
course meal at the ex-
pense of the tax-
payers. This kind of
thing is continually
happening, and the
gorge is always pre-
pared allegedly to enable
the dear little girls to prove
their efficiency, although the real
fact is that the crowd which attends is obtaining
victuals under false pretences. If the abilities
of the children must be tested, why not let them
experiment upon somebody who needs a dinner ?

A crocodile was killed last week in the
Logan River, south of Brisbane. The croc, is
almost unknown so far down the map, but this
one was probably on his way to Sydney to see
another land agent, not knowing that he had
already sailed.
English ha’penny papers
are “starring” an alleged
Ballarat man, who, they say,
has “scoured three conti-
nents ” in search of his runa-
way daughter. The yarn is
that the girl, who is 17, left
for Melbourne, and a 40-year-
old friend of the family had
business there at the same
time. It was a fortnight
before the alleged stern Bal-
larat father found out what
had happened; then he lit
out with his heaviest boots
on. He reckoned he could
catch up to his old friend
and kick him quick, but the
heavy boots were evidently a
mistake, for the fly-aways
kept ahead of him through
S’Africa, U.S., England, and
France, and when he fell
into the hands of the re-
porters he was at Trieste,
and had missed them by
three days again. “He is a
strongly-built man of 45,”
says one. “If they are mar-
ried, my daughter can go her
own way. If not, I shall
thrash the man within an
inch of his life.” Probably
the European reporters have invented either part
Q f the yarn, or the whole man. Present writer
only invented his boots.

The Chinaman is a strangely elusive being.
When he gets into trouble he is never, by any
chance, the person mentioned on his signboard ;
ke never was that person, and he never expects to
be. He doesn’t know even why the sign is there;
personally he is a simple child of Nature gaping
mildly at the universe. In Melbourne, last week,
the law tried to argue a point with Sam Yick, but
he swore that, though that was the name over his
door he was really Ah Hung Then it went on
to the case of Sara Wah, who declared the t,
though his business sign was Sam Wah, he was
really Sam Yick. The lawfined them 10s. apiece,
with , d«k suspicion in its mind that the, were
both Oat. They both looked as if the, might
be anything.
MAHOMET GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN.
HIS BETTER HALF : “ You seem to do nothing but

Melbourne Herald, in reprinting articles
from the local Morning Herald of 50 years back
is presumably going over much of the ground that
“Garryowen” covered with his Chronicles of
Early Melbourne.” But the reprints are none the
less interesting to the generation that has arisen
since “Garryowen” Finn published his chronicles.
To realise the newness of Melbourne, one needs to
learn from the Morning Herald of, say, June
21st 1855, that “The hounds met on luesday at
the kennel a short distance beyond Prahran
There were about forty gentlemen in the held, all
well mounted. A kangaroo was started at
Leman’s swamp, and, after a smart run of about
three miles, was run into and killed. The kennel
was located in the district now known as Windsor,
and the kangaroo was chivied around Elstern-
wick, or Prahran, where the alarming drapery
sacrifices come from.
A quaint excuse was offered by a Timaru
(M L.) publican charged with removing duty
stamps from seven hogsheads with intent to defraud
the revenue. Mr. Pubhchouse swore that the
stamps were eaten off by rats, with which his cellar
swarmed : and he called evidence which disclosed
a similar happening previously at his own ho.el,
and one at another hotel. The doubting beak
eventually dismissed the case.
# * * *
A recent Thames (M.L.) hotel fire swept
so rapidly through the kauri building that two
upstairs boarders were smothered by smoke.
Everyone else escaped in more or less undress.
The brigade, having fought the blaze to a stand-
still, went to bed, returning next morning to stamp
out any remaining sparks and overhaul the rums.
Turning over a sodden mass that had once been a
bed, a fire-quencher concluded he’d struck a third
corpse until the object grunted angrily, and asked
“ Why can’t you leave a bloke to have his sleep
out ? ” The most surprised man on the goldfields
was dragged out to see an uninterrupted view ot
the street; and standing there in the public high-
way, clad in a wet blanket, he demanded fiercely
if anything had been seen of his new boots.

A contributor digs among the suicides :
Ever since Australia lost its head and decided to
wander out over the earth and shoot perfect strangers, it
has been shooting itself in steadily increasing numbers.
In N.S.W. 26 men suicided at the end of a muzzle in
1901; since then the totals year by year have crept up to
43, 60, and 59. There are fashions in suicide as in otner
bad habits. Seven or eight years ago drowning was the
thing. In the four years 1896-1899, 155 men and 49
women in N.S.W. passed out that way ; in 1902 only 4
men and 2 women, and in the past four years but 48 men
and 25 women altogether. But, generally speaking, in
the matter of suicides rock-bottom was reached in
1902 and 1903, when only 90 per 1,000,000 of the
N.S.W. population anticipated what would arrive
anyhow before long. As to whether the lowness
of the figures was due to Federation, or to trie
fact that there wasn’t enough water for most of tne
people to drown themselves in (the drowning figures
almost disappeared those years), or because G. Reid was
out of office, the coroner’s verdict didn’t say. Australia,
bv the way, doesn’t hang itself to nearly the same extent
as most countries. Taking N.S.W. figures as a fair
average (they are thereabouts), only 18 per cent, of the
male suicides have strangled themselves in the past five
years, whereas there is hardly another country in the
world which doesn’t show over 40 per cent., and many of
them show V 0 per cent. Italy is the only one with lover
figures as regards suspension by the neck than the Au»-
tralian—ltaly mostly either drowns itself, or adopts some-
thing weird and wonderful by way of suicide that
doesn’t come into any ordinary class. And it isn t Italy,
but England, that stabs itself or cuts its own throat
the most times —twice as often as any other peop.e,
according to Mulhall’s figures. The more fastidious
Frenchman, of course, abhors that splashy, blotty way of
doing things, and when he doesn’t hang himself he
drowns himself. But nobody rushes to the gun like tie
Australian.
THE TRIANGULAR COAT.
MANAGER : “ That coat looks shabby. Why don't
you have it turned?"
OLD PRO.: “ And do you think, sir-r-r, this coat
has three sides? ”
Still they come. A Melbourne constable,
dismissed from the force the other day for being
drunk on duty, using obscene language, and
laving out a sub-inspector with a baton, is said
to have been appointed as an incapable and
tight policeman on the strength of his having
seen service in South Africa.
ATTITUDES AND PLATITUDES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Mr. Reid is surprised at Mr. Deakin’s altered atti-
tude.” — Press announcement on Monday morning.
Now Alfred’s changed his attitude,
And George is quite surprised,
For Alfred’s views are not as crude
As George had once surmised.
And divers papers now allude
To dangers from a coming feud,
Since Alfred changed his attitude,
And George is so surpris:d.
There is more grief than gratitude
At Alfred’s change of attitude.
And why is George so much surprised
At Alfred’s attitude ?
The fact is plain and undisguised
If things are rightly viewed.
It seems that Alfred realised
A partnership was ill-advised
In which one partner exerc'sed
No power for ill or good.
And he found no beatitude
In that lop-sided attitude 1
When George got Alfred to conclude
A “ truce,” ’twas criticised
In language that was sometimes rude
Because the “ truce ” comprised
A kind of vacuous interlude
(’Twas meant to soothe the multitude)
But all the gain to George accrued,
While AH. was hypnotised.
Friend George had lots of latitude
For striking any attitude.
Their principles were compromised ;
The Yes-No attitude,
And “Anti-Anything” comprised
The policy pursued!
But though poor Alt. was mesmerised,
It seems the demon’s exorcised,
And George is painfully surprised
At Alfred’s attitude 1
A pleasing form of platitude
When George denounces attitude 1

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, June 27, 1905.
My Dear Artni.—
Mr. Rupert Clarke, with a few friends, made
another start last week for Thursday Island. His
brother, Mr. Ernest Clarke, Captain of La
Carabine yacht, has recovered, and resumed his
place on the dog watch, or the binnacle, or what-
ever place captains have to be.
How significantly does a red hat show up
certain characteristics in certain faces. A girl,
with a complexion naturally pallid, flashes by you.
Her pallor makes you think of faces blanched by
moonlight, her eyes burn under the forward tilt of
her fiery hat. A cheap string of pearls encircles
a round, long, slender throat, the throat of early
youth. She looks a thing of frost and fire,
amorous and enigmatic. If you meet her in the
tempered daylight of the arcades the impression
°f her mysteriousness is increased, and you are still
thinking about her, and speculating as to whether
she would make you think if she wore any other
colored hat, when the tram-driver grinds the brakes
into his wheels and asks you in language the same
color as the hat if you want to be a dead remains.
Miss Fanshawe, daughter of our merman-o’-war,
has been doing the Cold Lakes of Maoriland in
company with Miss Portal, a daughter of an
English clergyman. They were snowballing in
Dunedin at a late date—at least, I don’t know
what else they could do in that bleak town at this
season.
Saw Julius. Knight in the street on Monday.
He has sufficiently recovered to get back to his
old quarters at the Wentworth Hotel, and with
the divine winter weather we’re getting should
soon be able to give back-talk to Nero with all his
old-time energy.
On the subject of weather, visiting actor Andrew
Mack insists that Sydney has the greatest climate
on earth. “This is not winter,” he insisted, the
other day. “ Don’t call this winter. It’s —well,
it’s Just It.’’ And with this aphorism from the
great American language the comedian closed the
discussion.
Miss Isa Struan Robertson, daughter of a
Murrumbidgee squatter, whose marriage to Dr.
Broad, one of an old Manly Beach family, took
place at the Australia Hotel last week, was as a
child made the heroine of an Australian story.
She was a beautiful and precocious youngster,
fearless, and surrounded with picturesque acces-
sories, hence an attractive subject for the fictionist.
The Woollahra Ladies’ Auxiliary of the Chil-
dren’s Hospital Fund is united with the Sydney
artists to promote the ball on July 3 in aid of that
charity. And the ladies’ committee, which, I
understand, is taking the major share of
the responsibility, has requested the artists
to forego the proposed pourtrayal of the
Haunted Czar, which was originally on the
ball programme as described last week. The
Governor is to be present, and the naval
and military officers are engaged to help con-
siderably, and it would amount to an inter-
national incident if, under such circumstances,
the Czar was. haunted, or the Mikado was repre-
sented climbing up a pole after peanuts, or any
other great foreign dignitary was cartooned, ca-
ricatured, mocked, or in any way represented as
leading other than the most blissful of innocent
lives. Probably the Haunted Czar would have
been the brightest item on the programme, but
joy must be sacrificed to dignity.
An Australian lady, recently returned from a
long tour, tells how, on presenting letters of in-
troduction to an artistic French family in Paris,
she was taken by its members to an artists’ fancy
dress ball. It was all very delightful, and nothing
startling occurred until supper-time, when a group
of painters came in carrying on a huge silver
salver a beautiful model. She was standing erect,
with fruit in one hand and flowers in the other,
and was dressed in a very slight draping of parsley.
The Parisians gathered round to admire and pass
art comments. But the Australienne ! She has a
dazed memory of getting under a supper-table, and
then leaving the room, with face hidden in her skirts.
The event so engraved itself on her mind that, no
matter what the future may have in store, it will
always tower up as the landmark of her existence.
Her life now falls naturally into three divisions—
that from her birth to the moment when the
Horror took place; the period spent under the
table; and the period beginning at the moment
when she fled out of the room, and ending only
with death. The Australian lady learned that
the model, after she had been sufficiently admired,
dressed herself and joined the dancers. There is
to be an artists’ ball shortly in Sydney. The
galleries would be filled with Honorables from the
Upper House if the men of paint were sufficiently
daring to follow that example—and if the Ladies
Auxiliary didn’t object.
Freemasons’ Annual Ball, in aid of the aged
and infirm, is dated for July 4, in Sydney Town
Hall. It is under the patronage of the Gov.-Gen.
and others of the elect. Another ball in aid of a
very worthy cause is that of the Montefiore
Home, which occurs next Thursday night at
Paddington Town Hall. St. Patrick’s Annual
Ball also comes off in Paddington Town Hall on
July 4; so, taking one thing with another, next
week will be a giddy period, and society will meet
the milk on the doorstep almost every morning.
With a committee of a hundred ladies selling
tickets, the Mayoress of Sydney’s Ball, in aid of
Children’s Hospital, on August 1, ought to be a
money-spinner. The Mayoress, it may be here
mentioned, will hold her next monthly “At
Home ” at the Town Hall on Monday, July 3.
How good for the piano trade must be the en-
couragement given by that corpulent body, Lon-
don College of Music, to the student who loves to
“paw ivory” ! At its recent annual concert an
army of slaves of the keys were presented with
diplomas, medals, and prizes, and no girl who has
been honored by the L.C.M. will, after that, con-
descend to play on the old piano on which she
mounted to household or township fame. Mother
is instructed not to give father a moment’s peace
until anew beast of burden is bought. L.C.M. is
only one of a number of examining bodies that
have their centres in Sydney, and it holds two
exams, yearly. Has been holding them since ’95.
What becomes of the thousands of the diploma-ed
and medalled girls ? Or, rather, what becomes of
their music ? It is still the exception to find in a
gathering at a friend’s house anyone who can play
otherwise than semi-shockingly. It is difficult to
find anyone to play anyhow. A pigtailed damsel of
my acquaintance was thumping for 14 months at
one test-piece for the L.C.M. She “ passed,” but
I don’t think she could ever play anything else.
The L.C.M. gave a concert, last week, to give
some of its victims a chance to be heard. As befits
an invitation show, the concert was listened to by
some 5000 persons. How the business representa-
tives of the Watkin Mills and Jessie Maclachlan
co’s must have groaned ! Signor Hazon once
wandered out to a football match, and, looking on
the grandstands packed, and the rest of the ground
seeming like the early door of the Black Hole of
Calcutta, he entreated the Almighty to tell him
why these people didn’t come to orchestral con-
certs.
Miss Leverrier’s concert will take place on July
Ist. to suit Lady Nortbcote’s convenience. Said
Lady has secured 20 seats. •
Sydney is filling up for the Sheep Shows and
Sales. Principal hotels reckon that a thousand
visitors will be here by Friday —the day on which
the Northcotes inspect the aristocratic muttons.
Mr. Alfred Canney, who represents an elect
brand of champagne, has, with his wife, come
from Melbourne to live in Sydney.
Earl Fitzwilliam and Mr. Tim Healy are mainly
responsible for Mr. T. B. Curran’s .transference of
himself and wife to London. The Earl and Tim
do not, of course, stand on the same political mat,
but the former was a personal friend ofSbe Aus-
tralian in his old House of Commons days. About
115,000 acres is Wentworth-Fitzwilliam’s share of
this planet; and one of his numerous castles is
called Shillelagh. Anyone with a place so named
ought to be well-disposed to persons named
Curran and Healy.
I was at J. C. Watson’s meeting the other
night—a meeting which the Labor women of
Sydney had promoted. The organisation was ex-
cellent, and a chairwoman kept the peace in a way
that would fill Mr. Speaker with envy. At the
conclusion of Watson’s address half-a-dozen
women speakers made notably good speeches. By
tradition, woman is a garrulous creature whose
tongue knows no stopping. On the platform she,
more often than not, shows admirable brevity.
But the labor woman seems to have a big advant-
age over the she-Conservative in oratory. The
well-to-do woman, as a rule, doesn’t speak up, and
as often as not reads her matter. The feminine
Labor leaguer shows earnestness and some natural
eloquence. “ I have pity for those ladies who get up
and say that the Labor party is against the marriage
laws,” said one woman at Watson’s meeting. And
there were cheers, “ I have contempt for the
men who put them up to say those things,” she
added, and there were great cheers. It was a
shrewd thrust. There is an obvious air of “ I’m
doing as I’m told ” about the women who climb
the platform and laboriously read a very wooden
oration in favor of Reid or the fatally beautiful
Mr. Smith.
The fact that little Lord Wendover, the 10-year-
old son of our one-time Governor Caringtoii, has
gone to school to learn the three R.’s has been
made the subject of an English cable. The ex-
Governor is 62 now.
Miss Alice Roosevelt, mentioned as a probable
visitor to Australia, is theU.S.A. President’s only
child by his first marriage. From her mother she
has inherited the biggest share, both of beauty and
dollars, of any of the Roosevelts. Her step-
mother’s half-dozen children are not lavishly pro-
vided with either. Yank papers are fond of seek-
ing out blue-blooded husbands for Miss Alice.
The latest was a small Swedish prince, but he has
just been annexed by one of the host of minor
royal misses in the Cold Country. If this belle of
New York does come our way, the great American
press will probably engage her to an “Australian
rancher,” who ranches in Pitt-street, Sydney.
Novel and beautiful effects come of a recent in-
vention whereby laces and the most delicate
fabrics, as well as art furniture, are electrically
given a metal coating of gold, silver, or bronze.
The cheapest material may be made to appear
costly and striking. Committees of fancy and
charity balls will be very glad of cloth of gold and
silver at tuppence a yard.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“ Nearly one hundred debutantes have come into
public notice during the past week. That’s a
fearful number, considering the accumulation of
old girls on the shelves of Society. At the
’Varsity hop a detachment of young beginners
evoked catty comments on the alleged bloom'less
species the present season has been showing forth.
The remarks were not deserved. The girleens
were nice enough. Just here and there was a
youngish face with sorrow’s shadows where all the
light should be. You know the story of that face.
Three or four elder sisters are ‘ out ’—have been
1 out ’ campaigning, scouting, challenging, and all
the rest of it—for years. And they’re still ‘out.’
So young Florinda knows the horror of it all—
knows the private vexations, humiliations,
wrangles, scratchings, tears, and curses of the
social spinster’s life, and she takes her turn in the
ball-room _ full of misgivings. I know an eighth
(young) sister who took me to a lumber-room and
pointed to seven ivory satin coming-out dresses.
The horror of it seized me. She laughed with a
catch in her throat. ‘And mine is to be hung up
there next week,’ she said.
“The municipal person is a great lover of a
whirl. I have seen over 2cwt. of civic father
bounce his avoirdupois round a ballroom with a
feather and fluff partner of doll weight, and he
bounced jubilantly as one who should say, ‘lama
man with the heart of a boy.’ But the partner’s
face! Ihe droll pathos of it. Yet well-intentioned
mayoral hosts and aldermen give themselves to the
debutantes for the grand opening Lancers of their
chiffon life, and think their weight and age and
out-of-date heartiness form a combination of
attractions to satisfy any young siren.
“ What becomes of the long Miss Talbot during
the hospital and asylum viewing of the suddenly
energetic Exes ? The poor visitor has either been
forgotten, or she breaks bread in private, or she is
consigned away with the cold storage of preserves
at Stonington. We saw her for a little while and
then no more.
“ The motor-spill is becoming as suspicious a
happening as an attack of appendicitis. The
breakdown in a lonely landscape, with no chance
of an early rescue, has been told so often that an
infant in arms smiles now when it is exploited.
And no bones are ever broken in these accidents.
“Some dentists consider Mrs. Grundy’s pre-
sence superfluous when a young thing is having
her teeth arrested, or taken into custody, or
crowned with a gold piece. The yarns of an
occasional impromptu hug or light rain of kisses
by the molar man have filled the aching girl and
her sympathetic ma with alarm of late; so if ma
can’t come herself, she sends in a crony to listen to
the shrieks of the daughter who is undergoing
painless extraction. One curt member of
the profession tells me that a man of any
artistic or beauty-sense is never so tired as
when he has finished dragging a dishevelled,
pallid, eye-strained, affrighted, unengaging
female round the room by the tooth. ‘Why,
when you have finished looking into her
mouth and have picked up her toupee and her
switch, dusted her complexion off your cuffs, ex-
tracted her fringe-net from your upper waistcoat
button, handed back her removable plate and
seen her without any of those upholsterings, Mrs.
Grundy is a superfluity.’
“Sailed for Europe last week, one of the most
promising young girl singers that Victoria has
produced. Her name is Eda Bennie, and he*
people are seemingly aware of the fact that a
voice which is going to Marchesi’s school in Paris
for education has no claim to public gratitude.
Anyway, Miss Bennie departed without asking
for a benefit. Melba heard her sing when she
was in the ‘ under 15 ’ stage of development,
and advised complete rest for the voice for the
next two years. Parkina and Watkin Mills have
lately endorsed all the sweet prophecies of Melba,
and now Miss B. is on her way to try the test of
competition with the large assortment of aspirants
at Marchesi’s. The damsel appears to be as
clever as she looks. She speaks French and
Italian quite respectably, and is musical to her
finger-tips.
“ The memorial window becomes a pain when
families add to the saintly auras their bloated
crest. The Christian halo, in conjunction with the
carriage crest in several Melbourne churches is, at
the.least, a humorous arrangement. It suggests
a fond hope that there will be carriage crests—and
lower orders to envy them —in Heaven.
“Mr. Harry Osborne, one of the polo cham-
pions of the woolly quarter, has been down with
a lung _ trouble. For some days no hopes were
entertained of his recovery. But he made a
valiant effort, and won.
_ “ The constable Geelan, who is threatened with
dire penalties for not arresting the public more
often, is the man who directs the traffic and
prevents wholesale motor-slaughter, at the Market
and Flinders streets junction. He is a splendid
specimen of the Foorce, to be sure! And the
cycling girl makes a hero of him, and she-tram-
travellers trail their vision after him admiringly.
“Bryan O’Loghlen’s eldest daughter has joined
her old chum—Baronet Clarke’s dame —in London.
Miss O’Loghlen has been abroad with relatives
for about two years.
“The musical Lavers, who have been guiding
the violinist star on his concert course (in con-
junction with one of the Tate brethren), have lots
of money—in which they differ joyously from
most of their kind. Mrs. Laver has a fortune in
her own right and a charming home in Mid
Brighton.
“Mrs. Herbert Embling, wife of Dr. Embling,
takes the horse lead this season. She hunts with
the Melbourne Hounds. Miss Raleigh has been
a close second so far. Miss Watt is a young
sport, but game as any. Miss Whiting and
several other beginners are, so far, shy of stiff
fences and a hard gallop.
“Miss Alison Fairbairn has brought two family-
treed nags from the Cold Country. She had a
rare riding-hack of her own last season, but she
fancied the novelty of importing from ’Ome, don’t
you know. Local nag-fanciers hereabouts are
now waiting to see if the beasties prove in any
way worth the importation. Probably they won’t,
except in so far as they gratify the vanity of the
ypung person who can reflect that she is not
patronising a beastly colonial horse. Australia
exports first-class nags to almost every corner of
the earth, whilst from the yarns I hear about
pleasure-horses in England, they’re sick or lame
most of their time, and you keep them mainly for
the joy of buying embrocation.
“ A dyspeptic male has written complaining of
the boarding-houses of the rural districts. He
hadn’t enjoyed, or suffered, a holiday for three
years. At last he came in for some back-pay, or
something, and packed up his bag for a week of
country life. A cheery pastoral boarding-house
was his aim, and one which mentioned in a simple
Horatian manner that ‘ boarders are taken on our
farm ’ won his heart. He saw himself surrounded
by tilled fields, hay-stacks, ripening corn, bees,
flocks of baa-lambs, and landscape views; and
he went forth to this Sabine farm for
rest, and roses, and cow-breath, and cream.
He found his landlady’s growler at the
country station. Three mouldy-looking boarders
with lantern jaws and a cold, frost-bitten,
ravenous look, were on board. It wasn’t a cheer-
ful sign. However, up he climbed. Sighting a
bleak-looking, wooden place with a melancholy
twirl of grey smoke stealthily rising from one
chimney, like the last lock of winter on a bald
pate, he asked, as an amiable distraction, who
lived there. ‘That is our crib,’ said the dreariest
of the trio, with a low gurgle. And it was—a fowl
run and a smoke-stained cottage. In some mud-
puddles a swarm of ducks played a solemn wet
game. One cow and a tottering calf roamed
towards a bit of a creek.
“A charming though precocious girl-fn who
was ‘Sweet Nell’ at the mayoral hop is Marie
Hall, a daughter of the Cooper-Halls, and a niece
of the M ‘Eaeharns. She is now twelve years of
age and as attractive as kiddies go at that awkward
age. But in four years time she comes into a dot
that will make her about the richest girl in
Melbourne, and then she will be positively lovely,,
anyhow.
“The death of Mrs. Balls-Headley (wife of the
Collins-street medico) removes a familiar and ever-
dignified personage from the pure-merino section
of Society. The tall, dressy dame was a faithful!
Toorak luminary. Her favored chum was an
equally dressy Somebody, Mrs. W. Leonard. The
pair wore important clothes, and gloried in grand
figures. As well-preserved, light-hearted middle-
aged dames they were always good to look upon.
A few months ago Mrs. Balls-Headley was stricken
with a serious illness, and died on Friday.
“ There is to be an inquiry into the matter of
impromptu guesting at the Mayoral hop. The
pasteboards conveyed the warning, ‘Nottrans-
ferable,’ but people thought in the crush of the
galleries their identity would escape notice. There
was no crush, and zealous eyes were out scouting.
So there are to be two or three inquiries which will
clear the atmosphere of much grumble, complaint,
and green-eyed malice.
“At the Saturday Heermann recital the cold
draughts of the Melb. Town Hall blew chill on
naked shoulders. The tall meditative son of
Hugo helped his dad to make music guaranteed
not to set the emotions ablaze. One thinks of
Gothic cathedrals, Cato virtues, bright tumbling
waters, sunrises in springtime, scraps of Milton’s
‘Allegro,’listening to the bearded fiddler. One
feels good. Hugo Heermann is a devoted hus-
band, the father of a large family, and wears a
beard.
‘ ‘ Miss Elms, who has been a journalistic identity
in this quarter for several years, has had a ‘ call ’
to London. She left on Friday, bearing a travel-
ling bag donated by the Argus, and a gew-gaw by
the Writers’ Club, and comforts for the voyage
given by many private friends. The active little
lady has such humor that she was able to supply
plain, solid feminine copy to the Freetrade daily
and jocular views to one or two Melbourne weeklies.
Her new post is that of reporter on the London
Morning Leader.
“ Sudermann has no humorous irrelevancies in
the ‘Fires of St. John.’ No female breaks into
the dark muddle of things by ludicrous flippancies
as in ‘ Magda ’ where certain grey and ominous
situations are interrupted for comic relief by two
adult she-persons. Yet the crowd gets its laugh
out of the long stretch of suffering at places
where the playwright intended tears. When, for
instance, the ingenue of the piece comes in her
dream-garb to say a second and more urgent good-
night to her stout lover in the mustard boots, the
audience giggles. When he adjures her to fly
from him with the reproach, ‘lf anyone should
see you in this condition ! ’ they laugh outright.
When, finally, the stout young man implores the
girl frankly to go back to bed, the whole house roars.
It made me hark back more tolerantly to the two
irrelevant females whose whispered colloquy as to
the quality and expense of Magda’s underwear
and the angular one’s ejaculation, ‘ Silk chemises!
Why, it’s perfectly awful ! ’ openly demanded
a chuckle. The good parts of ‘ The Fires of St.
John ’ are the bad parts. Theatre-goers stare at
a situation in the third act where Miss O’Neil
cowers on the stage, hugging the knees of the
gentleman (still in the mustard boots), and on an-
other episode of most desperate abandon. The
wickedest of them are horrified at what the stage
is abruptly darkened for. Ladies’ seminaries are
herewith warned off this act, unless the lights are
put out five minutes sooner.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Augustus Charles Gregory, who has just
gone to join the majority, was 86 when he died.
He was a wonderful explorer in his day, and in
the 13 years, 1846-1859, he covered enormous
distances in Westralia and Queensland. He
found almost everything he went to look for,
except Leichhardt; that lost botanist’s bones
were unfindable. And in the end Australia gave
Augustus Gregory his great reward; it made him
a J.P. and an M.L.C.


ASTHMA.
DR.
WILLIAMS’ PINK PILLS CURE A WELL-KNOWN SQUATTER.
“ A FTER sixteen years of constant misery,
\ and after wasting £250 on doctors, Dr.
r\. Williams’ Pink Pills cured me for good
of the worst case of Asthma that over a
man suffered from,” said Mr. Andrew James
Dunlop, a prosperous farmer residing in Heather-
ton, Dandenong. .
“One wet night, when coming home from
Brighton, I took the wrong track and got lost, ”
Mr. Dunlop went on to say. “ I had to tramp six
miles in the pouring rain, and arrived home
soaked to the skin. Next morning I could not
speak with the cold. In a week I was wheezing
with every breath. That was the beginning of
the Asthma that nearly cost me my life.
“My nose was completely stuffed up with
Catarrh. It took two hoUrS Steady hawking and
spitting before I cquld draw one good breath. You
could hear me wheezing all over the house. As
soon as it came ■ dark, a -horrible smothering
feeling came on. I used to moan and struggle,
and gasp for breath. In the dead of night I
would have to get out of bed and sit bolt upright
to save myself from smothering. Often I’ve
groped my way out into the cold night-air, so that
I could breathe enough to keep myself alive.
Dozens of times I nearly choked to death
C °“ g Noone in the house could sleep, for I did
nothing but cough, cough, cough,” Mr, Dunlop-
added. “I brought up yellow .phlegm streaked
with blood. My blood was m :x terrible state._
You 'may judge how full it was of poison when
I tell you that great blisters used to come out on
my chest, ijome were as big as a shilling, and
there were thousands, of little ones. When Mrs.
Dim lop cut these blisters open with the scissors,
yellow matter and corruption poured out of them.
My wife tended me day and night. I could not
lie down in bed. As soon as X tried I felt as if
someone were pressing a heavy pillow over my
mouth and nose, I had to get up and sit in a
chair by the lire. Then when I was utterly ex-
hausted with coughing, I might get an hour’s
'sleep, sitting bolt upright. For sixteen years
neither my wife nor I had a night’s sleep.
I ‘The coughing fits nearly lifted the top off my
head. My forehead burned, and there were
aching pains in the back of my head and
across my shoulders. The catarrh filled up my
nose, and the foul droppings into my mouth
sickened me. I had no relish for food. Every-
thing tasted alike to me. I was too weak to do a
stroke of work, and had hardly the strength to
walk. Many a time I prayed to God for death,
and Mrs. Dunlop went on her knees and asked for
relief for me.
“ Over £250 went on doctors and medicines —
but I still 'suffered' on. My ease seemed hopeless
whten Mr. I. J. Eden advised Mrs. Dunlop to get
m&sotne'Dr.-Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
He; said they cured him after he had Indigestion
and Rheumatism for years. Mrs. Dunlop wrote
to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. for advice, and
got word back to use Nasal Balm as well as Dr.
Pills." TheTeffer said that iCstEma
was a strange mixture of nervous trouble and chest
weakness, and showed how good blood was bound
to strengthen both lungs and nerves. I followed
their advice,, arid in eight weeks I was completely
cured. This was four years ago, and I have been
working hard on the farm ever since. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills have cured me of chronic Asthma and
nasal catarrh after twenty years of misery.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured Mr. Dunlop’s
Asthma because nothing can strengthen the lungs
and nerves except good rich, red blood'—and no-
thing but Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills can actually
make new blood. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills do
just that one thing, but they do it well. They
don’t act on the bowels. They don’t bother with
mere symptoms. They just root out from the
blood the cause of anremia, indigestion, headaches,
backaches, kidney disease, liver complaint, skin
diseases, general weakness, and the special secret
troubles of growing girls and women. Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills are sold by all chemists and
storekeepers, or may be ordered by mail from the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, at 2/9 a box,,
or six boxes 15/3. Write for free medical advice.

Kingston is paying a visit to Melbourne,
which looks as though his health had improved
sufficiently to make him hope to do a little fight-

Justice Owen, of N.S.W., according to

Possibly the Lands Commission smells may save

Apropos
“ Some Sydney
firsts ” (Bulle-
tin, 8/ 6 / ’O5).
The first Attor-
ney-General was
Saxe Bannister,
who arrived
April 5,1824. In
September of
the same year
W. C. Went-
worth und Ro-
bert Wardell
were admitted.
The first soli-
citors, W. H.
Moore and Fred.
Garlingy came
out in 1814, at
the special re-
quest of the Bri-
tish Govern-
ment, as there
were no free ad-
vocates of any
rank in the set-
tlement. Mr.
Moore took up
his residence on
the N.E. corner
of King and
George streets.
There are sever-
al still living
who remember
the house “ set
in an English
garden,” with a
brick wall on
four sides. In
1834 Mr. Moore
cut up the land
into 12 lots, and
sold them by
auction inLyon’s
“New Sales
Rooms,” corner
of Charlotte-
place —-the
“New Sales
Rooms” still
stand for
£10,318 16s. Bd.
The corner lot
(25jft.) brought
£55 10s. a foot,
the record price,
and was there
and then christ-
ened “The Gold-
en Corner.” Mr.
Moore gave un-
der £lOO for the
land and build-
ings. Some of
the structures
erected in 1824
still stand, notably one at the back, where four news-
papers were born and two died.
George Fairbairn, old Duncan Gillies’ suc-
cessor at Toorak, has returned from the Cold and
other countries' a much improved person. His
speech seems to have lost .all its old Brasseyan
inclination to get tangled, or to stop, or to fall off
at unexpected moments, and his long-suffering
constituents have again an intelligible—if not
intelligent—representative. .
It seems that Reid,. too,- was,
once on the dramatic stage. He confided. to a
Geelong audience last week that years ago he took
part as an actor in a tragedy, and, after spending
weekfi in learning how to speak 12 words and carry
a dead body off the stage, he forgot the words and
dropped the body. Ever since then he has stuck
to comedy. .
Melb. Herald’s silly idea of a prize com-
petition for selecting the ten best citizens of Vic-
toria has had its inevitable results. The ten best
of Collingwood were voted for the other week,
and, strange to say, Jack Wren, the tote man,
didn’t head the poli. Wren even failed to get a
place. He was declared to be the sixteenth best
citizen of Collingwood.
Rev. E. N. Merrington, a clever student
of Sydney University a few years back, and the
winner of a travelling scholarship; has won a
Ph.’D. at Harvard (U.S.A.), and is said to be the
first Australian to accomplish the feat. Harvard’s
Ph.D. means a stiff examination, unlike the
wooden-nutmeg diplomas of other seats of learn-
ing. .The U.S. has all kinds of Universities.
Some of them are of the best. Some, which exist
for the sale of diplomas, consist of a tenement
house, with the learned professor chopping wood
in the yard.
The difficulties in the way of the historian
are illustrated by the fact that some doubt has
arisen in Adelaide whether Colonel Light was
buried under the monument that (up-till last week)
commemorated him. several venerable
people were found, who said they actually wit-
nessed the funeral on October 10th, 1839. Un-
fortunately, in the interval, Light Square —then
the fashionable quarter —has become mostly the
resort of the Chow and the kind of girl who be-
comes Mrs. Chow, so the forthcoming statue to
Adelaide’s founder is to be put up elsewhere.
. An interesting and his- J
toric “ Sydney first ” was
William Balcombe, the first
Colonial Treasurer, who ar-
rived in April, 1824, in the
same ship that brought Saxe j
Bannister, the first Attorney-
General. Mr. Balcombe held
some position at St. Helena
when Napoleon was in exile.
Balcombe’s Sydney residence
was the house recently de-
molished to make room for the
Colonial Sugar Company’s big
building at the corner of ■
O’Connell-street. It was built
in 1824 by Captain William
Cox, ex-Paymaster of the
102nd Regiment, and founder
of the Cox family (Captain
Cox was also a “first,” as he
superintended the making of
the first road up Lapstone
Hill). Balcombe died in 1829,
and was succeeded by Campbell
Drummond Riddell, but the name
has not died out. A son, Thomas
Tvrwhittßalcoinbe, an artist by profession, lived
in “Napoleon Cottage,” Old South Road,
Woollahra, over half a century ago, and as late as
three years ago one of the name still occupied
the cottage.
E. W. O’Sullivan, N.S.W.’s great bor-
rower, sums up the -Baltic Fleet in three words :
1 ‘ Drunk—Funk—Sunk. ” As if one should say of
O’Sullivan : “Owe —810w —Go.
Kingston has some gift of repaitee.
In the S.A. House of Assembly a self-opinionated
member, during a speech about the voting
age limit, said truculently, “Why, I ; knew as
much at 18 years of age as I do now. You
knew as much at six!” came a growl from
Kingston.
“ Dareel” : Be Kinred’s Murrumbidgee-
Murray voyage. Twenty-four years ago, Shaw,
a medical student, canoed from Gundagai to the
Murray’s ocean outlet. Shaw,- who had also
canoed the Darling from Bourlce to Wentworth,
was afterwards the sole survivor of the Ingham
exploration party, attacked in New Guinea.
At 60, G. H. Reid says he will give but
very few years more to public life, as he wants to
enjoy a quiet old age. Therefore, he proposes to
“ devote himself to matters of. greater importance
than the fiscal issue.” In other words, he is going
to “sink the fiscal issue” and struggle' to Keep
office, G. H. Reid’s future comfort being of much
more importance than Australia s. And he calls
that public life !
The late Gilbert Probyn Smith’s most
notable feat in inkslinging was a pamphlet against
John Norton. For this John Norton prosecuted
him criminally, but the jury disagreed, and then
John gave his detractor employment on Mel-
bourne Truth. And when Smith died Norton
paid the funeral expenses, and sent a wreath
with the word “Nepenthe” to be placed upon
the coffin.
“O’Fipp”: Be naming of Pentndge
Stockade, Melbourne (B. l/6/’O5). The original
Pentridge, a little Dorsetshire village, has some
literary fame through its connection with poet
Browning’s family. Browning’s great-granclfather
was footman to a Pentridge squire, and polished
up the silver so accurately that he rose to be
butler, and expired in a blaze of local glory as
keeper of the village inn.
E. H. T. Plant, latest addition to Queens-
land’s nominee House, is an old Northern identity.
He arrived in Ravenswood in the early seventies,
made a fair thing selling the succulent chop to
the hungry “batcher,” and later on built the first
crushing mill. Ravenswood then looked like
going down. Plant bought his partner (Jackson)
out for a nominal sum, sent away for finer screens
for the mill, put all the tailings through again,
netted about £20,000, and from that day has gone
on adding to the pile. He shortly afterwards
shifted his mill to Charters Towers, and got a
controlling interest in many mines. Plant old
mill (with many improvements) is now owned by
the Bonnie Dundee G.M. Co. Plant, who is
grim, smile-less, but a good boss, isn’t suspected
of anything definite in the way of political
opinions, but bis wife is a great organiser and a
solid friend of the Democratic party.
“W.J.8.”: There was a Yes-No before

“ L’Homme Qui Bit”): — . ~ . ,
Barkilphedro bad but one thing in his favor, that he
had a very big belly. A big belly passes for a sign of
kindheartedness. But his belly was but an addition to
Barkilphedro’s hypocrisy, for the man was full of malice.
What was Barkilphedro’s age? None. The age neces-
sary for the project of the moment. He was old in his
wrinkles and grey hairs, young in the activity of his
mind He was active and ponderous ; a sort of hippo-
potamus-monkey. A royalist, certainly ; a republican—
who knows? a Catholic perhaps; a Protestant without
doubt. For Stuart, probably; for Brunswick, evidently.
To be For is a power only on the condition of being-
at the same time Against. Barkilphedro practised tins
wisdom.

Land agent W. N. Willis was on board the
steamer Geelong which goes to London via
S’Africa, where another gentleman whose name
has been mentioned in the Lands Inquiry (Hassall)
resides. Mr. Willis is understood to be a big
holder of land in Madagascar. By the way,
W. N. Willis was flitting with a valet. Go on the
Lands Department, young man !
Bishop Donaldson, of Brisbane, suggests a
partial application of communistic doctrines to the
incumbents and curates of Queensland. The in-
comes from some parishes give a good living,
while those from others starve the pastors. He
proposes that all the incomes should be pooled and
distributed, share and share alike, among all the
working ministers. But, alas ! the Bishop does
not indicate that he will throw his own income
into the pool.
The enemies of James Zimri Sellar,
elected to the S.A. Assembly in the Labor
interest, tell of his inability to remember names
and faces. When “Banjo” Paterson returned
from the Boer war, he was publicly welcomed at
Adelaide Town Hall. Sellar occupied a seat on
the platform alongside the war correspondent
and, during a lull in the proceedings, gazed
earnestly at the poet a moment, and murmured
audibly, “ And so this is Plugger Bill.”
Bernard Mathews, who died in, Melbourne
the other day at the age of 72, was the son of the
late B. R. Mathews, and came to Victoria in 52
with his father, who was in command of the
auxiliary screw steamer Great Britain on the
occasion of its first voyage to Australia. Mathews
senior belonged to the old school of navigators
who shortened sail every night, and thought four
months a good passage for a first-class vessel from
England to Australia. After the first voyage he
was ’superseded by up-to-date Captain Gray, w ho
maintained an average of 60 days for the trips
during a long series of years.
Passed out the other day Andrew Petei
Lind', a picturesque Sydney identity, whose huge,
quaintly-garbed figure, genial, bearded face
surmounted by a tall hat, and inseparable brolly
have (been familiar to Botanic Garden frequenters
for the past 10 years. He was the son of Peter
Erlaiidson, farmer, of Lindby, Sweden, and adopted
the name of Lind after his birthplace. Aftei
living some time in America where, it is said, he
was a Lutheran preacher, he came to Australm
about 20 years ago, and worked as a station hand.
Ten years ago he came to Sydney, banked his
savings (£884), and afterwards lived upon the
interest. He was taken in charge a few weeks
back, on suspicion of mental unsoundness, and,
a little later, moved on to the Hospice for the
Dying, where he passed out.
Joke Cook, who is now a more violent
anti-Socialist than even W. M‘Linen, is partly a
political joke and partly a political accident.
When the first State Labor party was being
whipped together, as a far more aggressive
Socialistic party than it is to-day, Joe Was check-
weigher at Lithgow. Smailes, a Primitive
Methodist parson, was the chosen Labor candi-
date, but at the last moment he jibbed, and Joe
elbowed himself into the job of preaching militant
Socialism, and was elected. Later on, the
party elected Joe as chief Socialist, and he led the
Socialist party in the House for some time, until
Reid became Premier, through the vote of the
Socialist party, for which he had angled for several
years, and later on, to further shovv his horror of
Socialism, bo took the chief Socialist into his
Ministry.
During the recent visit of Vic. Governor
Talbot tcTMelbourne Continuation School he in-
spected the history class—the period dealt wit
at the time being the Norman invasion ot
land. Incidentally, he mentioned that four of the
Talbots came across with the Normans, lne
Director of Education later asked the pupils who
the Normans were, and one bright scholar an-
swered, “Thevwere a band of thieves and rob-
bers ! ” But "surely that impression was not.
gleaned from experience of the amiable and harm
less Talbottle!
The gun and the man behind it :
John Macintosh, of the N.S.W. Leg. Council, who was
SPwitness the other day in a law case in which his old
hardware firm, John Macintosh and Sons, a ? k< T -I
£lO,OOO from a trade-protection office which had said
things, loomed up in the box a hard, grey, solid old man,
who never tasted liquor, never allowed it m his house,
never joked, and unbent so little that in his 60 years in
business in Sydney he hadn’t been inside 20 houses besides
his own. Iron, if a man handles it for 60 years, appears to-
enter soul as well as body ; for every old-established iron-
goods man seems to be much the same sort of person
witness Scarfe, of Adelaide, who died awhile back, and.
cut up for about half a million, though but very few m
even little Adelaide ever saw or heard of the man.
One explanation is that the profits in the hardware
line are smaller than in almost any other, rarely
running to more than 6 per Cent, on capital in-
vested, and that the ironmonger who keeps in the
business has to be of the hard, stern, keep-your-nose-
to-the-grindstone sort. But it’s a rule that seems to-
hold good pretty well all round—a man is fashioned by
the goods he handles. The man who handles ribbons,
and tells the lady that this is really the very latest thing
in torchon, parts his hair in the middle ; or if he doesn e
he ought to. And the man who grows cows, and milks
cows, and thinks cows, becomes more than half cow; just,
as the American who lives in the whirr of machinery
buzzes and jumps, partly because he wants to get out of
the way before the piston drops, partly because he knows
that when the machinery is running it is eating money,
and the sooner the job’s done and the power cut on the
more profit there will be in the contract. The cow-man
doesn’t whirr and buzz ; he knows that the cow’s machinery
is working hardest when the animal is most passive. Ana
the ordinary grain-farmer, who knows that most of the time
things are out of his hands, and rain will do more than-
hustle, gets into the same frame of mind. In a round-
about way all this has some bearing on the question or
defence;'and there aren’t many bigger Australian ques-
tions than that. The importing disease encourages a
population that handles calico over the counter—and
Heaven help the country that has to be defended by the
young man from behind the counter! Also, Heaven help*
the country that has to depend on the man who has been
milking the cow ! The Monkey has been bustling lately-
building things, making things, starting factories, run-
ning mills ; while the Bear has been largely a grain-
raising, butter-making person ; and the same thing is
happening at that meeting as happened under very
Similar circumstances when the U.S. had an argument
with Spain.
STUMPING THE COUNTRY.
Mr. H. E. Kelly, who used to be poultry-
editor of one of the R.C. papers, and began the-
alarm cry against the Labor party’s Socialism on
religious grounds, now- bitterly attacks Cardinal
Moran for not agreeing with him, and R.C.
journalism knows him no more. Mr. Kelly must
go. back to his chookies.
Sergeant Billy Davidson, for 30 years
coroner’s orderly at Melbourne morgue, leaves the
Palace of the Stiff to take the-rank of sub-inspec-
tor. Davidson has been so long associated with
battle, murder, and sudden death that the morgue
won’t seem the same homely old place without
him. Davidson went through all the big tragedies
of the past two decades, and suffered all the comic-
relief of the late coronor-comedian, Dr. Youl.
What the Melbourne “found drowneds” will do
without them both it is hard to conjecture.

N.S.W. Government has wisely decided
not to import a Pasteur Institute scientist to
inoculate bunny with a plague so as to secure his
extermination. It is against all reason and nature
to calculate on annihilating a species by the
promulgation of a disease. Bubonic plague is a
deadly thing, and rats are particularly susceptible
to its attack. The rats are ravaged again and
again by it, but never exterminated. If a disease
were inoculated among Australian rabbits it
would cause great mortality, no doubt, but it
would still leave the rabbit as a pest, and it would
at the same time, spoil the rather valuable market
that exists for bunny products. Bunny now pro-

Premier Bent, one day, when he was in a
promising mood, said he was going to make it
possible for all Victorian children to go “ straight
bang up to the University.” It’s a long, slushy
road some of them will have to travel. At Yanna-
than, near Cranbourne (Vic.), the roads are so im-
passable that the children have to walk along wire
and wire-netting fences to avoid getting bogged,
ouch acrobatic feats are more likely to land the
aspiring kid m the circus than in the University.

said, “ Yer wouldn’t think a dashed liv’d foller a

was hardly possible. “Well,” he said, “There’s
a dashed fly that’s follered me all that distance.”
He looked me over, and then stared hard at my
hat. “ Why, blow me, there’s the cow.” He let
out a savage blow and sent my new tile spinning.
Must have missed the fly, for I next saw him
racing up the road, making frantic leaps and
clouts m the air, like a demented scarecrow

A month later Shandy was missed again. I waited

ror the fourth time he went away, and his value
not being very high I decided to let him go alto-
gether. I didn’t advertise. He came back in ten
days, on the exact date his registration feil due. I
registered him and gave him away to a friend who
can afford to lose a dog. So far he has only had to
advertise for Shandy once, and then he got him
back for 2s. 6d.

“Homo “T.D.” (B. l/6/’O5) says he
‘‘discovered there were practically no uses for
them (Australian police-inspectors)
except to act the bush-lawyer in
minor courts.” etc. Aren’t there,
though ! They’re as keen and
tireless as bloodhounds in tracking
down a delinquent subordinate. One
instance of many I could cite : A
sergeant, who had just been trans-
ferred to a more important metro-
politan station, requisitioned head-
quarters for Is. or so, cab-hire, but
he was met with a big “WHY had
he disregarded the written order in
the book, directing that cabby him-
self, armed with the sergeant’s
voucher, should collect such fare.”
He pleaded that it was customary at
the other station to get the money
on producing the cabby’s receipt, and
that he had not been aware of any
such order. This brought the
whiskers and braid ’’ in charge of
the district down on that station
directly. He didn’t find the order,
but where it should have been he
found evidence of a torn-out leaf.
The luckless sergeant-in-charge was
forthwith arraigned for destroying
State property, and seemed in a
fair way to get 40 years’ “ hard,”
but that a constable chanced to
remember how the fatal leaf, with
others, had been torn out six years
before by the previous sergeant’s
youngster.
“ Eiddal ”
Formalin, mentioned by “Kink” (B. l/6/’O5), is the
new anti-smut specific recommended by the Department
of Agriculture to the cookies on the Kyabramapootra
fringe. There is a large area within cooee of Kyabram
where rust, whiteheads, and smut do much ravage every
year as the crops ripen. Formalin is supposed to be
better than bluestone as a grain-pickle, but, so far,
experiments have put cookies in a quandary. Last year
a Timmering cocky pickled with formalin, and had a
dandy crop, while his neighbors complained about the
smut, even in the adjoining - paddocks. This year, using
the stuff on a large scale, hundreds of acres have had to
be re-sown, a result attributed to sowing formalin-pickled
grain in dry weather, and to the needless violence of the
solution recommended by the Department. On the other
hand, a few miles further south, at Runnymede East,
numbers of cookies used the specific with complete
success, in all soils, and with the pickle as strong - as a lib.
bottle to three bags of wheat. The Department recom-
mends a lib. bottle to 40 gallons of water as sufficient to
pickle 14 bags of wheat. The trouble seems to be in the
soil or seed, or something, but no such trouble arises
when bluestone is used.
Ramofch Gilead ” : A few months ago,
near Inverell (N.S.W.), I was driving with a
farmer in his dray across to another farmer’s
place about a mile and a half distant.
I resently we came to a bit of a swamp.
and when about half-way through
the old mare jibbed. It wa3
an emphatic proceeding on
her part. The farmer tried
various kinds of persuasion
and words to induce her
to proceed, but it all
arrived at where it started.
At last he lost his patience
and swore an outback oath
that he would shift the
“ cow ” and the dray if it
occupied him till next
Christmas (it was just
January). He took a
pint-pot out of the dray,
jumped down regardless
of mud and water, and
commenced filling
pints of water and
pouring it into the
old mare’s ear. I
sat in the dray,
while the farmer,
every now and then,
adjured me to “’ang
on” for all I was
worth (which was
sixpence). For awhile
the mare took no
notice save to oc-
casionally shake the
water out of her hear-
ing apparatus, but
suddenly, just as the
cocky was tipping an-
other pintful, she let out
one mighty bound and
was away through the
swamp, and across the
small plain, as if it were
time to go to work and she
knew it was plough-day,
the old farmer screaming and
yelling to me behind to “ Stop
’er ! Stop ’er ! Pull the blank, blank,
blank, blank, blank, blank, blank up.”
This I did, after she had gone about three miles
and a-half, and broken a shaft and one wheel, and
most of the harness. “It’s not good to do that,”
he said when he caught up ; “ it’ll allers shift ’em
right enough ; but it mostly sends ’em deaf.” And
it did. The mare is deaf to this dav.

Peto : Happened on a weary philosopher
in the Yankalilla (S.A.) district. He was splash-
ing up the remnant of a cheque at a wayside pub.,
and went down among the dead men at closing
time, offering with his last breath to fight the
world and his wife for a small consideration. Prior
to catching the early morning coach I went into
the bar and found the courageous one sitting on
the floor and morosely refusing to budge, despite
the efforts of landlord and ostler. The latter
thereupon emptied a bucket of water over him,
but he exhibited not the least concern. When
the wrathful ostler had departed for another
bucket of water I offered to help the ruin out of
harm s way. But he waved me aside with a lordly
grace, and said, in a voice husky with booze and
dark-brown philosophy, “There are some mo-
ments (hie) when a man prefers to be alone.”
FILIAL AFFECTION.
No. 1 (loq.): “ Ole Smith, wot was caught picking
pockets at South Melbourne market last Toosday
night, is 81 years old."
No. 2 (sympathetically): “Poor old bloke! He
or ter ’are grandsons working for ’im.”
“Harry S.” : Have often hunted wild
pigs on Murray, Goulburn, and Lachlan river
frontages, and in the reed-beds we used to find real
savage old boars. I hunted on horseback with a
gun, or a shear-blade fastened to a light pole, and
with a few good kangaroo dogs. As “S.H.R.”
says (B. 25/5/’O5), some of the boars will make a
man sprint for his life. I have caught young pigs,
and fattened them up. As to the blacks killing
the boars with tomahawks, it would be difficult to
find either black or tomahawk on any of those
rivers nowadays.
BALLAD OF THE MAN FAR INLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘Ship me somewhere east of Suez,” where some old
flat-floored canoe is ;
Scoop me out a giant pumpkin ; give me two dry sticks
for oars;
Where the blessed bullfrog bubbles-where the tortoise
tells his troubles—
Let me wander by the moisture where the savage tomtit
roars !
Where the welkin welks with gladness-where there isn’t
any badness ;
Where the world is wet and cheerful, and the wagtail
wags encore;
For I’m sick of music-vampers, and I hate the stunning
stampers— b
Aye, I want to bite the ocean, and I want the sea once
more !
I desire a month of leisure spent in clean aquatic
pleasure—
I request a little dingy or a battleship or raft.
Let me sit astride a barrel, clad in Adam’s scant apparel
With the dampness round my ankles and a buckram
zephyi aft!
Let me swim, and let me swelter, where the seas come
helter-skelter—
Hand me out a tiny ereeklet or a river or lagoon ;
I desire to dip my body in a bath that isn’t shoddy—
I insist on the Pacific being carted to me soon.
In the desert I am wailing, where the brown dust-clouds
are sailing,
And I warn the Lord instanter that it’s wrong to keep me
here ;
If He fails to send me seaward—if lie falls away to
leeward—
I will bust the apparatus of this blessed hemisphere !
For I’m angry and disdainful, and I find the desert
painful,
And I’ll spoil this blooming planet if the Lord neglecteth
me.
I am sulky with creation—my ideal occupation
Were to sit astride an iceberg in a gold-and-purple sea !
“Ship me somewhere east of Suez,” where some water-
logged canoe is —
Scoop me out a giant pumpkin ; let me use my hands for
oars ;
Where the porpoise porpeth gaily—where the turtle turteth
daily —
Let me wander by the moisture where the savage tomtit
roars !
Where the welkin ivelks likes blazes—where the peaceful
moo-cow grazes —
Where the world is wet and winsome, and the wagtail
wags encore ;
For I’m sick of slaving here, Lord! and it’s like to cost
you dear, Lord !
If I fail to bite the ocean and observe the sea once more!

“ Orthos ” : For cast-iron cruelty com-
mend me to the action of the Government through
its P.P. Boards re rabbit destruction. Recently
in a western town (N.S.W. ), a struggling settler
was sent to gaol for not destroying rabbits on his
property, although it was shown that he had laid
poison and lost a valuable horse through its picking
up the poisoned pollard. He was surrounded on
three sides by Crown lands —breeding grounds for
the vermin, for the Government takes no measures
to exterminate the pests on Crown lands. Prac-
tically he was gaoled for not destroying rabbits on
Government property, a herculean task, which no
doubt provoked him to give “cheek” to the
haughty inspector instead of the usual luncheon.

“ Xerxes ” : Be sleeping out. Have known
three occasions where sickness and death followed
(and were very certainly caused by) a spree and
the subsequent “sleep out.” Some chaps think
they’re made of iron and patched with rocks.
INGRATITUDE.
DOSSER DICK: “And there ’e was a-layin' on the seat on which I doss regular for more'n harf
a year.”
SANDY SAM: “ My hoath! And arter you layin ’im on to that doss of paper as belonged to
Spoutin’ Bill as died o’ measles lars week!”
“Chip”: Amongst the reasons for the
non-occupation of Papua by white settlers are
difficulty in obtaining grants, prohibitive survey
fees, and the neglect of Gov. Macgregor’s provi-
sions as to the opening of roads by the natives,
who do nothing except decorate the landscape.
Senator S. Smith is not far wrong in stating that
Papua has been at a standstill for seven years. In
fact, it has retrograded, and will continue to do so
unless drastic measures are adopted.
“ Walrick ” : There is quite a noticeable
dying away of the native cat in many parts of the
N.S.W. bush. All round Walgett, Corinda,
Coonamble, Goodooga, Narrabri, lYtorce, and
numerous other districts, but a very slioit while
since the native feline abounded, whereas now it
is considered a novelty to see one in a month.
Some assert that the lack of cat is caused by a
deficiency in the commissariat department, i.e.,
that there is a falling off in the number of small
birds, etc., on which the animals exist. In the
light of the recent thick howl about mice, however,
this scarcely seems a likely cause. Probably some
disease like that which, a few years ago, wiped
out the opossums, is responsible.

“Quad” : N.S.W. politicians who visited
South Australia in support of local candidates are
much impressed with the methods of the local
German farmers. Thrower, M.L.A., says that
nothing is wasted, and their motto is maximum
efficiency out of everything. Reapers, binders,
harvesters, and other implements are carefully
sheltered and well cared for until next season, and
the German farmer’s maintenance charge in this,
respect is small. N.S.W. farmers have a happy
knack of hitching the reaper or harvester or
plough under the handiest gum tree, and leaving it
there exposed to all weathers. Next season, when,
parts give way, they wonder why.
BEEROLOGY.
ANCIENT (to Bung): “ It's no

good. I've bin drinkin'
beer all me life, an’ when I
kin smell meself like a burnt

beer’s only jitter wash dogs

same, I'll 'ave another .”
4 4 Timbarra n : Phe fox sooms to preier
black-feathered poultry. Recently chained one
up in a fowl-run, and on returning an hour later
discovered it chewing the head off a black pullet,
the only one of that color in the yard, lhis
struck me as being peculiar, so I placed a giddy
old Spanish rooster and his black missus in the
same run. Though other fowls came within the
fox’s reach, it took not the slightest notice of
them, but directly the ebony pair approached it
made a spring, and clawed both down at once.
Further experiments were interrupted by Mrs.
Timbarra and a broom-handle.
ON WATCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lights on the harbor where the ferry-boats are gliding
Fairy ripples flashing where the foaming waters churn ;
-Gloom on the water where an ocean boat is riding,
And whisp’ring of the wavelets that are lapping at the
stern.
Glad voices blending in the chanty they are singing, .
Borne upon the night breeze toward the swelling main.
God! I can see it all and hear the chorus ringing—
See it all, and hear it in the wind upon the plain.
(There that blasted, restless ewe comes sneaking out
again.)
White lights so still, and red lights that are racing—
Streaming through the darkness as they pass a rival
boat ;
Slow lights and glow lights—each other ever chasing
Making ferry-boats like fairy palaces afloat.
Crowds on the decks, and, in the night wind’s crooning,
Sounds of lilting laughter and the music of the bands ;
Out on the beach there are fifty couples spooning,
Whisp’ring words of sweet import and clasping tender
hands.
(Seems to me that break’s not right; I hope the darned
thing stands.)
Roar of the streets and rattle of the tram-cars,
Bearing in their human freight to swell the noisy crowd.
Naught here for me but to sit and watch the d —n stars
Winking down to mock me ere they slink behind a cloud.
Glare' of the footlights—and then the curtain falling ;
After that the suppers and the girls upon our knees.
Red lips and wine. Ah, the siren city’s calling—
Calling in each crooning note that’s humming through
the trees.
(There’s that brute again. She’s scared of everything she
sees.)
Hush o’er the town. The busy streets are sleeping ;
All the pallid human slaves are resting for a space.
Darkness and gloom o’er the sullen harbor creeping.
Gone are all the fairy lights ; black shadows in their place.
Mayhap a girl at her window sits a-dreaming;
Gazing out toward the west with brown eyes that are
wet—
Wet with the hot tears that sometimes will come stream
ihg ;
Tears for the bygone years—tears of vain regret.
(There’s the beggar out again. I'll kill that devil yet.!)

SPINIFEN.
Ernest Favenc writes :
In all that has been written about our Australian abo-
rigines, I have never seen any reference to their natural
politeness and urbanity. The usual idea of a blackfellow
—a true myall—is that his first notion of politeness
towards a stranger is the civilised one—“ to eave arf a
brick at ’im.” Nothing of the sort-though that becomes
his idea after a very short acquaintance with the white
man, and small blame to him. When you meet the real
mvall, and avoid outraging his sensibilities, you find him,
according to his lights, a well-bred gentleman. Some of
them make what might pass for a bow, and wave their
hand in dignified welcome. They desire you to be seated
(i.e., squatted), and always pull two or three tussocks of
orass for you to subside upon. When you inquire the
name of the creek, river, or water-hole you are on they
give it to you at once ; and when you try to imitate the
sounds they laugh pleasantly as if to say, “ Not bad, for a
first attempt.” Do you desire to know if there is water,
they reply by signs that there are seas, lakes, rivers. Are
there fish in them (a question generally put to judge of
permanency)? Immense quantities, you are told not
with the view of deceiving you, but out of politeness.
You will be pleased to hear that there is plenty of water ;
then why not please you? And anything in the camp is
yours, from a dusky maiden to a buck’s pet boomerang,
thouo-h offers of this kind are to be understood bpanisb
fashion, and you would be foolish to attempt to walk oft
with everything that in courtesy is offered to you. Ex-
ceptions to the rule are the older gins, who will roundly
abuse you, order you away, and threaten you with a
yam-stick. Nor can their men-folk prevent them. W hen
an old black amazon gets the floor she is as deaf to reason
as an adder, or a book-canvasser in hysterics.

mitted, whether sent by post or handed in ; and in
no case will MS. be returned unless stamps (of any

Wager : The office dictionary shows no differ-
ence in the present usage of the words. But there used to
be in common use such terms as “ wager of battle, •
and nobody ever called a cballeng-e to single combat
a “bet of battle.” W. McD.: Passable in an artistic
sense, but liable to misconception Yam: “Passing of
George ” presents too unpleasant a picture to the mental
vision.... L. B.: Thanks for Punch verses. Sorry to say

smoothness... .Fool: Well, yes, you are to an extent.
There’s an obvious difficulty in a newspaper striving to
keep out of its advertisement columns “all but the
advertisements it believes in.” The censorship would be too
troublesome.... 0. H. S.: That letter is an old chestnut....

Indifferent stuff in impracticable handwriting.. / ■
Good idea, not too well handled... .Geoffrey P. . Basis of

Too thin and precise. You lack literary blood.. ..M- --
Fancy the following- two lines of ‘‘Doubts Demise aie

right track Wimmera: Has good points, but you lack
skill and experience Kerani: Idea not well enough
developed....J.L.F. : Long yarn about military strategy
has nothing to do with tiie case for an Australian navy.
The essential point is that at present Australia pays and
has no real guarantee of any protection, however poor
her own navy, it would be some protection. The Brinsn
Admiralty, by the way, according to latest advices, is
coming round to our view that the local naval protection
of Australia is best left in the hands of Australia, and it is
said that the hired fleet will be withdrawn at the con-
clusion of the present subsidy term, not at the in-
stance of the Commonwealth, but by Britain itself....

There’s no call for hysterics over the Yellow
Peril, but for hard work and sensible prepara-
tion Nulla: Verse not up ; one par usable......
P.T.S.: Why do you mix your objurgations up wnn
Latin? You evidently don’t know the meaning ot tne
Latin you throw about, and you might, in your ignorance,
be saying, in the dead language, that the Bulletin w
worth sixpence, whilst in live English you hold t
opinion that it is a scoundrelly publication....

J.B.G. : Nothing very good in last batch A.J.M. : Will
use picture and verses... .Harold C. : Joke about printing
and consumption quite invisible K.: But the figure in
the box isn’t Reid. It is apparently Grover Cleveland,
and the whole thing- looks like a copy... .W.J.C. : One
may do as suggestion... .Cyril D. : You want much more
practice Bandy: Not even a distant resemblance
GF : “New Light” is the scratchiest picture of the

very medium picture T.B.M. : Picture ingenious, but
not suitable for use....G.A.W. : Hopeless....H.A.O.M. :
Also hopeless.

A VOICE FROM THE DISTANT BUSH I
WAS LIFE WORTH LIVING ?
Bramah Creek, Rugby, N.S.W.
Messrs. FISHER & CO.,
Chemists and Druggists,
337 George-street, Sydney.
Sirs,—Your Phospherine has saved my life, and
I am only too anxious for everyone to know of my
case.
For years I was under the doctors in this
district for a complication of diseases.
Burning pains and acute inflammation of the
stomach, with nausea and vomiting, made me
very miserable.
For 28 years I had been a great sufferer, but
after using FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE for four
weeks, all Indigestion, Wind, Heart Pains, and
Sourness of the Mouth disappeared.
I now eat well, and sleep soundly.
I took from 5 to 10 drops after meals, and 10
drops at bedtime.
I tell all my friends up here the good news.
Yours faithfully,
JOHN J. MURPHY.
FISHER’S
PHOSPHERINE
(kegisteeed).
DOSE. —For Rheumatism, Weakness, Lassi-
tude, Backache, and Loss of Appetite, five to
eight drops in a tablespoonful of water, at rising,
noon, and at bedtime. For Neuralgia and severe
nerve pains, take ten drops in a wineglass of
water; repeat the dose in half an hour, then, if
necessary, five drops every two or three hours.
An Infallible Cure for Headache, Brain Fag,
Indigestion, Biliousness, and Sleeplessness.
Five drops in water after meals is the greatest
aid to Digestion known.
It takes away a sour taste in the mouth, and
makes the breath sweet and pleasant when taken
half an hour before breakfast.
Prepared by the Sole Proprietors—
FISHER & COMPANY,
Chemists and Druggists,
337 George Street, Opposite G.P. Office, Sydney.
Wholesale and Retail.
Mr. THOMAS FORSYTH, of Ashfield, writes
and declares on oath the following :
“I suffered from acute inflammation of the
stomach, with a burning pain. My tongue got a
thick coating over it, and I constantly suffered
from nausea. Why, I used to be almost constantly
vomiting. I consulted two doctors in Ashfield
for years without getting relief. But in three
weeks FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE completely
cured me. I am Noble Grand for the Loyal
Ashfield M.U.0.0.F. I have been in the Lodge
for 18 years. Most of the members know of my
illness. Five to ten drops of FISHER’S PHOS-
PHERINE always takes away a sour taste in the
mouth and keeps my stomach in regular order.
Let everyone know of my case.”
Subscribed and declared at Ashfield this Twentieth
day of August, one thousand nine hundred and
three, before me,
A. R. LEM AIRE, J.P.
NEURALGIA. NERVES.
Mr. JOHN SHEPHERD, of Rand wick, writes / was suffering from acute Neuralgia down
the veins of the neck and over the whole head and face. My mouth was much swollen. /am
subject to these attacks, and was six weeks under a doctor.
“After commencing to take ‘FISHER’S' PHOSPHERINE I had immediate relief, and in one
day was cured; there only remained a slight weakness from the excessive pain I had endured.
“ Whatever is the matter with me in the future, # will always use ‘ FISHER’S ’ PHOSPHERINE,
for it is a most wonderful MEDICINE and NERVE TONIC.”

Griffith and Allen, Patent Attorneys of
Sydney, have opened a branch of their business in
Melbourne —(Broken Hill Chambers, QueeA-st.),
under the management of Mr. H. P. Keogh, of
' Melbourne.*
The chief ingredients in successful business
organisation are brains and enterprise. And these vital
qualities have been used to such good effect by Dri
Thomas as to have produced a surprising perfection of
equipment and suniptuousness Of appointment at his
palatial Dental Establishment, in Swanston-street,
Melbourne. Not only are his operating surgeries fitted
with all the latest and best in pain and trouble saving*
appliances, and his waiting rooms luxurious with artistic
furnishings, but his mechanical d(partments, where the
most wonderful dental work is achieved, abound in the
latest inventions for turning out the beautiful, the
sound, and the effective in artificialteeth. One marvellous
feature in this respect is that a full set of teeth can be
supplied without a plate by bridging from' only two
remaining natural teeth. And this is undertaken Cy Dr.
Thomas at a much lower charge than obtains in Eng .•and
or America. In fact it is scarcely too much to say that if
any sort of improvement in dentistry were discovered in
the planet Mars to-day the doctor w'ould have it at his
remarkable surgeries the day after. Also the doctor
shows a sound knowledge of human nature in select;. »_•
such handsome as well as highly skilled staffs of both
sexes.. To be attended to by such Apollo-like craftsmen
and artists at their craft must help lady patients to forget
the last relic of discomfort that may yet linger in denta.
surgery in such a pain-abolishing establishment, while
even unimpressionable male patients must draw delight
from the clean and smart appearance of operators and
lady assistants, as well as from their clean and smart
operations.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
We shall certainly have to send Reid and
Joe (Dook to England to talk seriously to the
House of Lords, which has just passed a Socialis-
tic Bill for the appointment of a Public Trustee.
“ Exile ” : Re payment of N.S.W. old age
pensions. I know of one place where this has
been done for three years by the local post-
master. Am told the practice is general where
there is no branch of the Bank of N.S.W. If
these officials do it in some cases, why not in all?
Parramatta Asylum, now housing State
derelicts, was one time the mill where the re-
nowned Parramatta tweeds were first manufac-
tured by James and William Byrnes. The im-
porting policy works out its natural results, and
the home of young industry becomes the refuge of
old derelicts.
William Affleck, ex-M.P., wants Premier
Carruthers to annul at one stroke all exist.ng
appointments as Justices Qf the Peace in N.S. \v.
There are 7000 odd Jay Pays on the rolls, and no
Cabinet would wilfully alienate that number of
votes, though every Cabinet in turn condemns the
J.P. system as a nuisance.
Geo. Reid was very pathetic and very
characteristic in appealing to his last Sydney
meeting. “Didn’t I give you nice soft jobs?” he
whined. “Didn’t I give you jobs painting park
railings? You don’t get jobs like that since I left
office in N.S. Wales. It’s stone-breaking you get
now.” The self-confessed man of jobs—nice soft
jobs! ,
They formed a branch of the anti-Socialist
League up at Dubbo (N.S.W.) the other day, and
the local mayor became president. And about
the first thing the chief anti-Socialist did after
his election was to advocate that the local
hospital, which is hard-up, should be taken over
and run by the State. These leagues live right
up to the great yes-no principles of their founder.
At the Commercial Travellers’ Club dinner
(Melbourne), Bent cried out that General Booth
should have called first upon him, and not upon
Reid, regarding immigrants and settlers, and im-
plied that he would have granted requests for more
Sopulation, whereat he was cheered by the crowd.
>ut Bent was fooling them, for, asafact, General
Booth did first call on Bent, and was sent on from
him to Reid.
It is commonly reported that Labor
candidate Mat Reid lost the Burrum (Q-) election
through the visit of his namesake, .George—the
man with the eye-glass and the contradiction.
Australia’s half-Premier addressed a meeting at
Childers just about that time, and many people
took him for Mat, and said they wouldn t vote for
such a shocking person if he were ten times a
Labor man.
Sydney City Council is asking the Govern-
ment to pass an Enabling Bill, empowering it to
establish municipal libraries, art galleries, gym-
nasia, abattoirs, and dispensaries. But there is
little real work possible until a Greater Sydney is
achieved. Then control and ownership of all
harbor ferry traffic, tram and motor-’bus ser-
vices, water and sewerage service and lighting
should be aimed at.
Bishop Mercer (Tas.) argues that Tatter-
sail’s sweeps should be suppressed because, while
the Government obtains revenue from that source,
it will not impose adequate land-value taxation.
Does the Bishop really think that the two subjects
are related ? Governments have been chasing Tatt.
from State to State these many years, and not one
of them followed his expulsion by imposing an
adequate land-value tax.
George Reid’s trick of calling for cheers
for the King when a meeting is hostile seems to
have been inspired by Elijah Dowie. When the
crowd would not listen to him, ’Lije whispered his
wife to read the Bible, so that he could make out
they were ‘ 1 jeering at the Word.” Similarly, Reid
whispers in the S.M. Herald reporter’s ear a call
for cheers for King Ned. If the unhearing crowd
continues to hoot G. H. —well, it is disloyal.
The chief mechanical engineer of Maori-
land State railways remarked recently that the
construction of locomotives was proceeding satis-
factorily. The 10 engines that were being locally
built were as good as those produced m any part
of the world. Victoria, too, satisfactorily builds
its own engines. It is onlj N.S.W., seemingly,
that is so ignorant and uncivilised a State as not
to be able to do so (vide Sydney daily press).
Almost the most amazing thing in the
amazing N.S.W. Lands inquiry is the calm, blas-
tiferous, off-hand fashion in which land agents,
such as R. D. Meagher, undertook, for a “sub-
stantial fee,” to get the rent of State property
reduced from £1.13 fi ye&r to between £3O and
£50,” and to get the 14 years’ lease extended to 28
years, and things like that. Did these land agents
own the Minister and the Department body and.
soul—principally soul ? R. D. Meagher even used
the Parliamentary stationery—the letter-paper
and envelopes paid for by his suffering country—
to write to one of his clients—the one who was on
no account to pay the rent that he owed to the suf-
fering country. When a third party borrows our
own envelope to write to our own tenant telling
him to diddle us out of our own rent—it is too
much !
The Anti - Socialist Association, which
G. H. Reid labors over, bids fair to be the last and
most comic of the long line of political organisa-
tions he has founded or used in his own interest.
He began with the Patriotic Association in 1869
W. C. Windeyer was his favorite accomplice then
—and his path since is marked by the tombstones
of dead associations, the policy and. principles of
each being ignored or reversed when it had ex-
hausted its power to shove Reid farther forward,
or to prevent him sliding back.
“E.H.H.”: Seeing the great Liberal-
Labor victory in recent S.A. elections and the
good reception that Watson got when in Adelaide,
the Federal Liberal-Labor people should send one
or two of their top-notchers to address meetings
in the principal Vic. towns. -It would do no end
of good. Certainly Tom Mann has- spoken m
some Gippsland towns ; but what is the good of
him talking six hours a day and ‘ ‘ Awake ! Arise !
to the average cocky ? But plenty would go to
hear men like Watson, Hughes, Mahon, M‘Gregor
and Dawson.
When Watson comes into his own again,
the knowledge he gained on the Queensland trip
will be of benefit to Australia. At Halifax the
other day he learned :
On the Johnstone River there is a Chinese who is ready
to buy or lease any quantity' of cane land. This man de-
clares he can get sufficient Chinese labor from Port
Darwin and Singapore to do all the field work north of
Townsville. Recently practical experience was obtained
of the prevalence of Chinese immigration. A farmer met
a Chinese on the Johnstone River, and failed to make him
understand English. “He new boy,” said another
Chinese, “and no sabee.” That the law is being con-
tinually evaded is asserted on all sides, but no one knows
how it is done. All that everyone is sure about is that
more Chinese are seen about.
ANOTHER UNRELIABLE STEERSMAN.
The Labor party in Parliament still sinks the fiscal issue-the most urgent thing in Australian politics.
Terrified Crew (which voted for the captain at last election): “ Heavens, man ! Where are
you steering? ”
CAPTAIN: "Oh, I’ve nothing at all to do with that. It isn’t my business. I've sunk the
navigation issue."
A deputation of Vic. village settlers in-
formed -Minister Cameron the other day that
had no outlet for their produce unless they paid
12s. a ton to get it carried or sledged to the nearest
road, a mile and a half away, and no State school
for their children within three miles,, the path to
knowledge being covered with thick undergrowth.
During the past 14 years the settlers have pe-
titioned several Governments for a small grant of
money to make a rough road through the bush,
and now they are going to get it. That s how the
Bent Government scores. A little money covers
a multitude of sins. Previous Treasurers had
fewer sins, but less means of covering them.
“Grace Watson,” secretary to the Austra-
lian Women’s National League, makes a loud and
continuous racket because Labor-leader Watson
(who belongs to N. 9. W.) has, as she alleges, not
openly “disowned” certain anti-religious state-
ments which appeared years ago in the Idcsin
nublished in Victoria. Grace Watson herself is of
the political cult of Jos. Symes’ Liberator,
which was also Freetrade and anti-Labor; and as
she has not publicly “ disowned ’’ the frantically
atheistic articles which appeared in that publica-
tion people have a right to assume, bv her own
logic, that she believes in spelling God with a
small “g,” and depicting the Almighty as a
battered old artisan making planets with a turning
lathe.
Lever Bros., the soap people, seem to have
a solution ready for the returned Kanaka problem.
They are setting up copra plantations in the South
Seas, and want native laborers—thousands of
'them—and would give preference to the Kanakas
returned from the Queensland sugar plantations.
Even the-maddest Tory can hardly suggest that
Lever Bros, are cannibals who would eat the
Polynesian, or that he would be in any danger of
“relapsing into barbarism ’’.under their charge.
At Tokio, Japan, lately, the Liberals tried
to -hold an ordinary .peaceful political meeting to
select a candidate for the Japairese House of Repre-
sentatives, but the police scattered them before pro-
ceedings commenced. The force didn’t even wait
to hear if the speakers w-ere going to say anything
against the blessed Mikado. A Sydney daily
described the incident in an approving sort of way
under the heading “How Japan deals with
Socialists.” If the episode had happened in the
Bear’s country, it would have been headed
“ Another Autocratic Outrage.”
That eminent cormorant, the Van Diemen’s
Land Co., carries the huge gristle it calls its
heart on its sleeve. Its directors, at their London
meeting the other day, announced that its pros-
pects of increased protit in the future lay
in the increase in land values due to public
improvements (made at the taxpayers’ expense).
Pursuing the theme, the directors advised that
the co. should not sell the land, but lease it to
small farmers, so that it mightbe able to snatch the-
unearned increment when it came along. Tas-
mania is to put up the money to improve the
V.D.L. Co.’s property, and then pay extra to the
Y.D.L. Co. because of its own. improvements.
And Tasmania is too dull to see the swindle.
No wonjer the “pore farmer” gets
all sorts of concessions. In the new South-
Australian Assembly (42 members) there are
10 of him, not to mention three graziers,
a fruit-grower, and a chaff-merchant. But there
isn’t one single representative of the manufactur-
ing industries, barring, perhaps, Coneybeer, who
is a collar-maker. The farmer is, in fact, begin-
ning to take the place in Parliament that the
lawyer used to have.
Just about the time... when the
N.S. Wales Government was explaining copiously
that it had dug down into the very base and
cellar of the matter, and assured itself that
there was no legal means of preventing W. IS.
Willis leaving the country if he felt so inclined,
John Haynes was taking steps which resulted in
the sudden capture of W. N. Willis at Albany.
Now, either Premier Carruthers didn t want to
see the troublesome Willis back, or he chant
know much law, or he was too lazy and too careless
in public mattefs to look up the law he did know,
or John Haynes has fallen "into a dreadful hole.
If John isn’t in a large hole, then Joseph is in an
enormous orifice. One thing certain is that, when
the new r s arrived, John was looking about twice
his usual size, while Joseph fled to his home ill.
A department of Sydney Telegraph's new
page, “On the Soil,” is headed “Outside Our-
selves.” The editorial columns, devoted to ex-
plaining what the paper thinks is the meaning of
Socialism, is “ Beside Ourselves.”
Last Friday, N.S.W. Premier Carruthers,
who the previous’day had been more or less
attacked in the Assembly, gave evidence before
the Lands Commission. According to S.M.
Herald, he said that “the Sims Land Appeal
Court case was the only land transaction that
Willis ever brought to the office of Carruthers and
Wilson.” Same day, the Herald’s law report'
showed that Willis was suing J. H. Doyle “to-
recover the sum of £l2B claimed to be due for ser-
vices as land agent and for money paid on behalf
of the defendant,” and Mr. McManamy (Messrs.
Carruthers and Wilson) appeared for the plaintiff.
Evidently Carruthers sees worlds of difference'
about a land job and the recovery of money for'
doing the land job.
Alfred Deakin’s Ballarat speech, in which
he declared that he would fight for Protection
next session, moved both Sydney morning papers
to shrieks of anguish. They both explained to-
him frantically .that there were only two courses-
open ; he must be an anti-Socialist or a Socialist.
The tariff issue was sunk ; it was dead ; there was-
no such thing : it mustn’t be spoken of, because it
would upset Reid’s apple-cart; and Deakin “must
be on one side or another,” and must run after one
or other of the Tory papers’ two ghosts. The
Telegraph got so much off its head that morning
that it threw this strangely incomprehensible'
remark of oyer 100 words off its chest :
It is a matter for general congratulation that the pro-
fessional and scientific student is not to be unduly bur-
dened by .the necessity of acquiring a high standard of
knowledge in the subjects outside of those that are
-essential to his future prospects in the battle of life, and'
in this respect the framers of the curriculum appear to
have nicely adjusted the balance of requirements so that,
on the ofle hand, the student shall go forth frtfm the Uni-
versity flagrantly ignorant of the ordinary acquirements
of an educated person, while, on the other hand, his pro-
fessional studies shall not be retarded by an undue
devotion to subjects of pure culture.
When Premier Bent, of Victoria, made
his recent remarkable financial announcement by
candle-light, Premier Carruthers, of N.5.W.,, at
once fled into print and explained that he waa
quite as bright a financier as Bent, and would
have an even bigger'surplus. But this action on
Joe’s part is too thin. Bent promises that the
Victorian public debt will be less at the end of the
year than it was at 'the beginning, and'Jhat he will
devote an amount equal to all the land sale re-
venue to public undertakings. Carruthers bids
fair to add about £1,600,000 to the N.S.W. public
debt, arid charges all his public undertakings to
loans, and even if he has a surplus as large as
Bent’s he will, in addition to all'these borrowings,
have spent two-thirds of his land sale money as if
it were ordinary revenue. Moreover, in Victoria
the expenditure account is kept open till August,
so' that all possible claims may come in and be
charged against the year, and a Vie. surplus is
only arrived at after paying these claims. In
N.S.W., under the political swindle which Reid
devised, the expenditure account closes so sud-
denly on June 30 that a half-year’s interest on
certain loans which is paid a,way in London about
June 15 isn’t included.
“ Melb.” : Posing as a member of the
Imperial Federation League, I went to the initia-
tion of Alfred Deakin as president, in place of
Justice Holroyd. Alfred takes himself with
proper seriousness in this new billet, as he does at
the Bible-in-Schools League. The gathering was
of about 13, including four reporters, one of them
specially retained to pick up or take down every
diamond or pearl that dropped from the states-
man’s lips, for it was arranged that he should
speak an oration an hour and a-half long, to be
published In a pamphlet of 2000 circulation,'
whereby new blood is to be set pulsing through,
the veins of the mighty cause. With very inade-
quate stimulus —indeed, hardly any —Deakin,
launched away. I sat entranced for the whole
hour- and. a-half, like Adam listening to the angel
Raphael. When the magician ceased, Pouf!
the whole thing was gone. I cannot believe that;
Deakin persuades himself. He made out that
what we are doing now is only, in time, the mere;
geological—or shall I say astronomical —infini-
tesimal beginning of .the miraculous empire to be
compounded of Canada, South Africa, Australia,
Maoriland, England, Ireland, Scotland, India,:
Burmah, Hongkong, Singapore, a third of New
Guinea, a bit of Guiana, Bermuda, something in;
the Caribbean Sea, the Straits Settlement, and I
think the Straight Waistcoat, but I forget. It
was all folly—pretty folly, but folly.

Another Case of Tumor.
Doctors Advised Instant Operation.
VITADATIO
Has Removed it.
Read what Mr. ARSCOTT writes.
*
Dear Sir, — I think Vitadatio worthy of great praise as a
genuine remedy. It has saved me a few pounds expenses
in doctors and medicine. My wife had a tumor on her
neck, causing her much pain and alarm. The doctors,
when consulted, advised instant operation—there being
danger in delay—but my wife shrinking from this, we
consulted a herbalist, who wanted 6 guineas per quarter
for an indefinite period to remove the disease. Vitadatio
was then brought under our notice, and we resolved to try
it. By the time the fourth large bottle was used the
tumor had come right away, leaving only a mark on the I
neck wiiere it had been. There has been no return of
the trouble, and my wife has enjoyed good health since.
You are welcome to use this as you please,-1 am so
satisfied with what Vitadatio has done for my wife.

NO TROUBLE. NO DANGER.
The Most Effective Way of Applying a Natural
Remedy.
cpHE ingenuity ot the Japanese has never been more clearly
demonstrated than by the invention of the Hot-Box.
The poorest ’ricksha-man in Japan carries a Hot-Box and the
wealthiest nobleman would never be without one. In sick-
ness and in health the Body-Warmer is equally appreciated.
One of these handy little contrivanoes carried in a coat
pocket or in a lady's muff saves the bearer from feeling the
cold of winter. When travelling by coach, train or steamer,
a Hot-Box placed between the feet will keep you as warm
and cosy as if you were beside a bright coal fire. Clerks
and others engaged in sedentary avocations where there is no
heating appliance highly value the Hot-Box as an efficient
substitute for a stove or grate. For the almost instant
relief of Neuralgia, Toothaohe, Bronchitis, Influents, colic
and, in fact, of any ailment or pain in wbioh the application
of heat is beneficial, the Hot-Box is far preferable to any of
the usual methods, such as hot-water bottles, hot compresses,
&o. Alt these soon lose their warmth and have to be replaced ;
the Hot-Box. on the contrary, maintains a regular degree of
heat for several hours. It has the especial advantage of
being instantly available; wilhin one minute it is ready,
with no further trouble than merely striking a match and
setting light to the fuel. It will make a cold bed warm and
cosy in a few minutes. These are but a few of the many uses
.and advantages of the Hot-Box. The price is only 4s. 6d., in-
-cluding a supply of fuels and cariiago paid to any address,
•carefully paokcd In a box with full directions. Additional
fuels can he had at sny time at sixpence per packet (enough
for about forty hours' warmth), which makes it by far
the cheapest heating apparatus ever devised, l'lease bear in
mind that there is no trouble with the Hot-Box and no dan-
ger; it emits no smoke or smell, end it cannot under any
circumstantei set fire to anything else. Send postal note of
any State for 4s. Gd., and enolose this adverl iscment with order.

On Becoming Great.
This is a recipe for making a reputation in Aus
tralia
Take of ability one grain, mix with a heaped-up hand
ful of impudence, thoroughly soak in alcohol. There is
no need to bake ; it will be accepted raw.
It is one of the curiosities of the Australian
temperament to stretch generosity in regard to
human failings to the point of folly. How often
is heard the sorrowful : “ There’s Bickley — a
wonderfully able chap Bickley. But unfortu-
nately he drinks. If that man would only keep
sober, he’d be the first in the country.” Investi-
gate Bickley, and it will be found that, some
time or other in his besotted career, he had a
lucid or unbeered interval, and did about two-
pence worth of honest work. His reputation as a
genius has been built on that —and drink. Be-
cause he does drink and doesn’t shine, it’s over-
charitably assumed that, were he to give up the
drink, he would, so to speak, put electricity to
shame for ever afterwards with his refulgence.
In private affairs, this doesn’t matter very
much. Whether Snaggs, who is always
sodden with beer, would, without beer, be a
nightingale of song or a painter of magic pictures
is, from the public point of view, immaterial. But
when the same sentiment obtrudes into politics it
is actively mischievous. More than one Australian
public man remains a public man chiefly because
he is a reckless sample of the giddy ox, or a very
bad specimen of the plain, every-day sot. It ii l
reckoned that beneath the flood of beer there is a
lurking genius which will astonish the universe
some day—when the beer gets off the top of it.
The beer is obvious, the genius is gratuitous
assumption, but beer must stand on something
or it would fall off, and that something, it is
often taken for granted, is genius. It would not
be good policy to utterly boycott from public life
the able man “ with a weakness.” But it is a mis-
take to rush to the other extreme and assume
transcending ability because a man’s character i 3
usually disguised in liquor. Such a disguise
should be a hindrance; it should be held that if a
man is scandalous and drunken, that is a special
reason why he should be called upon to more
fully justify his reputation for brilliance. Instead
of this, the drunken man often gets in where the
sober man is shut out, because if the sober man
doesn’t exhibit his mental capacity, it is assumed
that he has none. His rival can pull through on
the mental capacity he might show if only he were
sober enough to show it.
The Blindness of Britain.
The necessity for adequate representation of Aus-
tralian interests in London grows with each month
and each event. There is at present no means,
for example, by which Britain can get even a
glimmering of the Australian feeling in regard to
Asia. Even the English Radical papers, which
are ready to reprobate Chinese labor for the Rand,
do not understand Australia’s objection to Japanese
immigration. Thus, for example, Reynolds re-
cently :
Both Japs and Chinamen are at present heavily fined
for landing on Australian soil, as also they are for landing
in British Columbia, where a considerable number of
them are settled. So heavy is this fine, that to bring
their wives and families with them is out of the question.
Neither in Australia or British Columbia do the Orientals
compete with white labor. They employ themselves in
occupations which the white man will not willingly under-
take. They are market-gardeners, laundrymen, and
domestic servants. They regard it as a great hardship
that their women-folk cannot follow them to the lands of
their adoption, and this may give rise to trouble in the
future. We may remind the Australians, however, that
the Japs have never yet made any unreasonable inter-
national demands.
The Englishman is, wilfully or through stupidity,
blind to the fact that the chief reason against
Asiatic immigration in Australia is not the
economic, but the racial one; that Australians
want neither to brew their blood with nigger
blood nor face the American alternative of
frequently roasting a nigger—to band music and
a matinee girl audience —in order to keep him in
mind of the fact that he is a nigger, and must
not aspire to mix with white folk. Perhaps
if the British knew something of the strength
of White Australian feeling in the matter
of colored immigration, they would look at
their Asiatic relations in a somewhat different
light. Perhaps the knowledge would not make a
bit of difference. But we at least owe it to the
dear old mother country to let Britain know bow
we stand, so that, if another tea-tax incident is to
come, it will come deliberately and not as a result
of blind blundering. That duty we do not observe.
There are, in London, agencies to represent Aus-
tralian butter and Australian meat and Australian
debt, but none to represent Australian national
feeling.
The Bulletin gets a plaintive little letter full of
hard and bitter truth from a place 300 miles hack
from the coast. The writer had “ gone on the
land,” as the papers and politicians told him to;
and he tells some of the things that are happening
to him: —
We wanted some salt; you can buy it in the city for
75., but the railway freight cost us Bs. My boy has had
to go about 100 miles away to get work. For a treat we
sent him a bottle of butter, a cake, and a bottle of honey.
How much do j'ou think it cost U 3 to send that little lot ?
Four-and-ninepence ! It costs us close on £2OO a year for
food; and then we live dreadfully plainly —I wouldn’t
like to tell you how plainly; I’m sure lots of people
wouldn’t believe me.
And the battler who has “ gone on the land,” 300
miles.out, and has to pay Bs. freight on a 7s- bag
of salt, and 4s. 9d. to give his youngster a bit of
butter in a bottle —he has to pay at the same rate
to get his uncertain produce to the market. Yet
300 miles isn’t so very far (Moree is 414 miles
from Sydney, and Pera Bore 515). And all up
and down tlie coast there are millions of acres of
from first-class to decent country, and not a
graduated land-tax to force the holders to open it
up for settlement. So the men go out 300\ or4oo
miles, and when they get a pot of honey and a
bottle of butter call it a banquet, and pay 4s. 9d.
for carting it.
“ E airplay ” on S’African politics, showing that
there is a borrowing issue there too
Re B. R. Wise on S’African politics (B. 1 S/5/’0o). The
writer seems to have a fair grip of the situation for so
short a stay in the country, but is mistaken over the
efficient Civil Service. That is the real stumbling-block
in the way of the races working together amicably. The
officials are all new to the country and know nothing of
its language and customs. How should we like it here, if
we had officials in the Post Office w;ho only spoke German ?
That is the position the Boers are in now. The language
question crops up everywhere. Any man in business
has to learn Dutch ; why not the officials, too? If the
native laws v ere properly administered there would have
beeu no need of outside labor. But extra taxation is put
on the whites, and even the old taxes are not collected
from the natives. In the Orange River Colony the
revenue last year was over £1,600,000. The highest before
the war was never £500,000, and yet before the war all
public works were built out of revenue. Now-, under
British officialdom, even repairs are paid out of loan
moneys and all public works are charged to loans. These
are the things the Boers do not like ; they say they will
be there when all the gold and diamonds are gone, and
when the English are gone too, and they (the Boers) will
have to pay the debt.


Mr. CHARLES J. STINE,
of Stephenson’s American Musi-
cal Comedy Company, tells of
the benefit derived from taking
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Mr. Stine has been appearing throughout
Australia and in New Zealand in “ Mama’s New
Husband” and ‘“Brown’s In Town,’’ delighting
thousands of people. When asked how it was he
kept in such fine condition physiciallv he
unhesitatingly said it was because he always
made it a practice to take two or three of Hr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills when he felt he was
beginning to get out of sorts. He went on the
principle that an ounce of prevention was worth a
pound of cure. Mr. Stine, in his letter, says
“For months past I have been troubled with my
liver. My mother-in-law, in America—long before
I came to Australia —recommended Hr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, which I tried, and I tell you
honestly that after using them I feel like a
different man. They aid digestion, cleanse the
stomach, and give tone to the entire system. I
always have a bottle with me, and find them
to be all that you claim them to be. A pill or two
taken once or twice a week regulates my system
perfectly, producing sound sleep and elasticity of
spirits. You may make whatever use of this you
think fit. Yours very truly, Chas. J.
Palace Theatre.” Many people think if some
prominent man recommends a medicine it must be
all right, but blood is the same in King and Kaiser,.
Prince and Peasant, Senator and Tramp. The
medicine that will regulate the system of every-
body. Hr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills assist in the
digestion and assimilation of food, cleansing the
stomach and driving poisonous humors out of the
blood, making it rich and red. They area positive
and permanent cure for all complaints arising
from stomach, liver and kidney trouble, and are a
perfect blood-purifier.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“F.” : The uncompleted second test should at
least take the edge off the grumbling of those Australians
who profess to see nothing but absurdity in the English
system of limiting cricket matches to three days. An
unlimited allowance of time for the second test would
have made it a “soft thing” for the Englishmen, not
necessarily on their merits, but on the happening of the
weather. Played in Australia on the same weather con-
ditions, the definite result would not have been a fair test.
Given a lead of 2F r ' runs, with five wickets in hand, to
either side at the end of the second day’s play, it goes as a
matter of course that heavy rain on the third day robs
the “out” side of all chance to make a big score on its
second innings. In that case the “ draw ”is a fair escape
from defeat. Moreover, the English system is always fair
enough, whereas the Australian system of playing a
match to a finish, for the sake of the finish, is distinctly
unfair more often than not. Three days play in England
is nearly equivalent to four days in Australia. With a
batsman’s wicket for both sides, the side that can’t win in
three long days is not decisively stronger than the other.
With rain happening during the progress of a match, the
side which gets all the worst of the luck is entitled to the
chance of a draw.
* * * *
With July begins the one had piece of arrange-
ment in the Australian cricketers’ programme. On the Ist
they finish a game at Bristol, in the south ; then rush up
to Leeds, in the north, for the third test; back to South-
ampton-extreme south ; up to Derby (most of the way
to Leeds again) ; back to Bath (within 10 miles or so of
Bristol) ; and then right away (past Derby and Leeds) to
Edinburgh, to try and whack the ball into the Grass-
market.

Marylebone C.C. has now taken a hand in the
shindy which is going on among the cricket authorities
in Australia. Having received two invites to send out the
next team—one from the new Board of Control of the
Associations and the other from the Melbourne Cricket
Club—the English body declines to do anything until it
gets only one invite, and that from some institution which
is qualified to speak as one having authority. Away back
in 1887-8, in consequence of disagreements in the Aus-
tralian cricket camp, two English teams, one under
Hawke and the other under Shrewsbury, visited Aus-
tralia. There was hardly enough glory and profit to go
round, and the M. 0.0. wants no more confusion of that
kind.

“B.B.”: The exclusion of Gehrs from the
earlier matches (and the subsequent failure) is partly
explained in a letter received t’other day. “Climatic
conditions and dietary changes had an unwholesome
effect, and he was compelled to consult a physician.”
Most of the members were similarly affected, and the
early outlook of the team was o’ershadowed in mystery
and doubt. Gehrs has played better in later matches,
and it will only require a return to Australian form for
the young South Australian to occupy a place among the
best —a miserable best at that.

The most recent exhibition by the Australian
XI. against Essex is absolutely the worst of the tour. The
cable described the wicket as fast and good, yet the
Australians, against nearly the worst English county, only
totalled 100 and 202. There were 34 sundries ; while four
Australian players failed to score—Gregory getting a
“pair.” The only redeeming features were Laver’s 10
wickets for 129, and Hopkins’ 67 not out.
* * * *
By suffering defeat at the hands of Essex, the
Australian team, with but a third of the programme
through, has lost its problematical chance of beating
the performance of the 1902 team, which got through
the whole 39 matches with but two defeats. Though one
of the weakest counties, Essex has often upset the calcu-
lations of visiting teams—notably the 1899 team, which
included nine of the present crowd.

Death of Bradbridge at Dulwich Hill (N.S.W.)
leaves only Hilliard and George Gilbert alive of the first
N.S.VV. cricket team that played Victoria in Melbourne.
In 1858 George Gilbert carried out his bat for 118 runs at
a match in Sydney Domain—the biggest score made till
then in the State.
* * * *
The N.S.W.-Queensland Rugby match was lost
to the former owing to the failure of the Cornstalk kick-
ing. N.S.W. was apparently gone in the feet, and the
indications are that had the team possessed but one
reliable bootist it would have won the match. But it was
Wickham’s off-day, and nobody else was given much
opportunity, and most of the Cornstalks failed to do any-
thing with even what opportunity came their way ; so
the game which ought to have ended in a decisive defeat for
the Bananalanders resulted in a victory for them by 8 to
6 points. Tries, penalty kicks and marks were mulled
by the Walers, all falling short or going outside the posts.
Presumably the Queensland forwards bustled the Corn-
stalk shooters, as they seem to have been exceptionally
fast. But on the other hand the Cornstalks had an un-
usual number of opportunities to score from the field
and threw them all away. At half-time N.S.W. was
leading by three to nil, having scored a try. In the
second half the Bananalanders came with a mighty rush.
They had speed, and they used it, scoring a goal and a
try in rapid succession. After saving several times by
prompt forcing, N.S.W. managed to struggle across the
line once more, but, as usual, failed to add the points
which would have made the game a draw. It was a sorry
business, for with their opportunities N.S.W. should have
practically won the match in the first half. *
The defeat of N.S.W. by the Maoriland
“Soccer” team was expected, for it was generally con-
ceded that the Metropolitan was a stronger crowd than
N.S.W. Still, as a matter of sober fact, but for the misfor-
tune of losing a couple of good men in the second half,
the Cornstalks would probably have won. They played a
fine game, in spite of the fact that they had had prac-
tically no practice together, and the end of the first half
found the scores—N.S.W. 3, Maoriland 1. It was while
N.S.W. played shorthanded in the second half the Maori -
landers scored five goals while the Cornstalks made one.
Under the ordinary conditions, the chances are that the
N.S.W. team would have surprised the critics by winning
by a larger margin than the Metropolitans did a week ago.

The big match between Fitzroy and South Mel-
bourne teams, played at Sydney Cricket Ground, under
Australian rules, was the closest of even things. The
teams seemed to be so nicely balanced that the slightest
bit of smart individual play would decide the issue.
The fourth quarter of the game was played in failing
light, and in the confusion Fitzroy seemed to get the
luck, and the game ended in a victory for it by 9 goals 10
behinds to 8 goals 9 behinds ; or 64 to 57 points.
* * *
How are the mighty crumpled up ! The
hitherto unbeaten Glebe, the hard dribbling team which
had downed every club it met, barring Sydney (and
against Sydney it made a draw), struck Cannae and Liao-
yang and Leipsic all at once when it met South
Sydney on Saturday. Fifteen thousand people were
squeezed into the uncomfortable Sports Ground.
Glebe had four of its best men away two with
the Inter-State team, and two on the sick list. South
Sydney was only short of one of its cracks, but
even then the wreck was something unusual. Twenty-
four points to nil in first-grade Rugby is a serious
thing to contemplate. It is very doubtful if the
absent ones would have made much difference. Glebe
back division was not in the same street as that of South
Sydney at any time ; but General Opinion said that the
Glebe forwards were so superior to those of South Sydney
that if the South’s halves could be smothered, so as to
prevent them feeding the three-quarter line, the trick
was done. As usual, General Opinion was wrong.
South Sydney forwards, though lighter than those of
Glebe, were faster, and if they couldn’t dribble they could
pass. Also, the scrum half and the five-eighth played a
beautiful game, and there was no hope of smothering
them, so Glebe was beaten on every line. South Sydney
is now at the head of the list with 14 points. Glebe, of
course, comes next with 13 points. Western Suburbs
and Newtown follow with 11 each.
Owing to the excitement over the South Sydney-
Glebe match on Saturday the other Rugby contests were
but poorly attended. University downed the unfortunate
Eastern Suburbs (the club that has lost the whole eight
matches, and has not yet even drawn its bye) by 11 to 7.
This was a much better stand than anyone expected
E.S. to make. Balmain was off color, as Western Suburbs
rolled it up by 16 to 6 ; and Sydney District walloped the
North Shore men by 15 to 9.

While the Victorian League football teams,
Fitzroy and South Melbourne, were giving the Cornstalks
an exhibition game in Sydney, and Collingwood stood on
its dignity and sulked over the League’s refusal to allow
it to play ex-Westralian Rowell, the other five League
teams combined to play Ballarat, and put the statued
city’s representatives through in sudden style by 110
points to 29. The sizeable Crowd that witnessed the rout
wished afterwards it had joined the 12,000 spectators
on the Richmond ground, where the S. Australians
beat the Victorian Association by 8 goals 14 behinds to 6
goals 19 behinds. The Vic. League fell out last year with
the Croweaters over the distribution of the “ gate ” —the
eternal “ gate w —and played W.A. and Ballarat instead.
This year Adelaide determined to have a match with the
Association (the ten minor clubs) and the result was the
very best game of the season, with close scoring and an
exciting finish. The Croweaters were a younger team,
many being mere boys, but they were faster, and
quicker at passing the ball when blocked, also their
high marking was first-class; but their kicking was
poor. Though the scores don’t indicate it, at least
half their behinds should have been goals. It made
for added excitement that they weren’t, for in the last
quarter the Vies, steadily crept up to within two points
ofS.A. ; then the latter got another behind. The Vies,
replied similarly ; but in the last five minutes the Crow-
eaters rushed the ball down determinedly and notched a
goal—and the game was won. In this match, for the
first time, the players wore numbers—cloth placards on
the back, 18 inches by 12 —and they proved the failure
they were expected, being undistinguishable at a distance
in the dull wintry light, especially on the black-and-white
striped S.A. uniforms. Also, once the game got interest-
ing, nobody bothered about them.

Wellington (M.L.) Rugby Union is dealing out
“ stoush ” pretty heavily. For using language during a
recent match a' player was “ outed ” for five years—an
attempt to make the disqualification “ life ” being lost by
one vote. The referee of the match complained that
language had been heaved at him, and also that he was
kicked hy barrackers ; as a result, one offender was denied
admittance, to %11 grounds under the eye of the Union
for three years." Heavy penalties are the only way to
suppress the wreckers of football.
• • • *
The inclusion of George Smith in the M.L.
team for Britain was one of the surprises of the tour.
Two years ago (after being amateur champion hurdler
and flat-racer, prior to which he was a jockey) he defi-
nitely retired to private life ; but the chance of the trip
to Bull-land was too alluring, and he donned the guernsey
and got the reward. Smith’s pace makes him a very
showy footballer ; but, as with most champion athletes,
there is the fear of injury lurking in his movements.
* * * •
Australian football enthusiasts in W.A. don’t
like the methods taken to introduce Rugby and “ Soccer ”
there. The Australian game has held undisputed sway for
years, but imported school teachers are trying to
substitute the ideas of dear old England and, in some
cases, have gone so far as to prohibit the boys playing
Australian football.
* * * *
Only one lightweight figures in M.L. Rugby
team picked to kick England—Stead, of Invercargill
(10st.). There’s one other under list., five are under
12st., ten under 13st., seven under 14st., and the re-
maining unit is a 14.6 forward, who acts the part of
guiding elephant in the scrums. Jimmy Duncan’s ton-
nage isn’t included in this schedule ; his weight is the
large weight of experience, gleaned during a period of
half a century, or thereabouts.

Lieutenant Bill’s name is struck out of the two
Cups, and the Caulfield hero of 1902 may be counted

sundry times during the past 2£ years he threatened to

A yearling colt of doubtful parentage (by Come-

Spite of the fact that, reckoning on previous
public form, the big event at Warwick Farm races (Satur-
day) looked a gift for Kelso’s colt Fanshawe, owner never
invested a shilling on him, and many hard-headed punters
who had already backed the nag hedged because he
looked sore. There was no soreness in the way he ran,
however ; after always being handy from end to end, Fan-
shawe owned the race at the home turn. Luck was
against Kelso in another event same day—his lepper,
Clodian, succeeded at Canterbury previous Saturday, but,
having been “ off his feed ” for a few days, he raced at
Warwick Farm absolutely unbacked by the stable. And
then he won as he liked, and twice in one day the owner
was left thinking of what might have been.

A New York pawnbroker has been inspired
with the notion of carrying his trade to the racecourses
on a specially-devised motor-car. If the punters are
suffering a more disastrous day than usual the licensed
usurer might take in hundreds of pledges before the last
race, and some of his clients could actually put their
shirts and boots on their off-chance.' The spectacle of
Moses Moses motoring home with the jewellery and
under-garments of a blasphemous multitude would be
comfort and joy for the anti-betting crusaders, anyhow.
“ Melb.”: Talking of veteran jockey Higgerson,
I have just parted from one who knew him well, the brisk
and active Sam Chifney, who rode the Banker to victory
in the Melbourne Cup of 1863, 42 years ago, and he would
excite no surprise if he appeared in the pigskin at Flem-
ington to-day. The next Cup winner in seniority I know
is Billy Anderson, rider of The Quack, in 1872.

The bookmaker who lays “ tote odds ” has been
having a rough time in Auckland (M.L.). A sportsman in
a country town despatched several wires to various
bookies, and suspicion was aroused owing to these mes-
sages, which all laid money on the right horse, arriving
after the races were over. Still, they purported to have
been despatched before the race, so the books paid, and
the sportsman won some £2BO. Later on, being still
gnawed by suspicion, the turf accountants placed the
matter in the hands of the police, and asked them to in-
vestigate whether the messages were not really sent after
the races were over, and the wrong hour of receipt put on
them by a hired telegraph minion. The investigation
showed, however, that all was as it should be, but that
the telegraphists had not been over smart in transmitting.
Then the detectives, who didn’t want their time to be
wholly wasted, summoned the bookies for illegally laying
“ tote odds,” and got eleven fines of £2O each.

Big Jim Stanbury plugs along laboriously on
the Parramatta River for the match with Towns for the
world’s sculling championship; and the surplus flesh is
rapidly disappearing. Still his work isn’t all that could
be desired, and, in early parts of his sprinting, there is a
clumsiness which tells of long absence from fast boat-
pulling. Towns, who is a much smaller and more wiry
athlete, reckons that only five weeks’ work is necessary to
beat Stanbury. “Old man” Bill Beach says Stanbury
will win.
* * * *
Likely that, after the Towns-Stanbury sculling
match, veterans Bill Beach and Peter Kemp will settle a
question of superiority. Beach has issued a challenge, at
which his old rival Kemp promptly snapped. The pro-
posed match is oreating much interest—more, in fact,
than the championship struggle.

Sandwiched among the dog-trials, at Melbourne
Exhibition, last Saturday, was a cock-crowing contest.
Angry male chooks had been kept in the dark all the
morning, and when brought out they naturally supposed
it was breakfast time, and let go. The winner turned up
in E. O’Donnell’s brown Leghorn, which cock-a-doodle-
doo-ed 26 times in 15 minutes, the next bird being a good
second with 25 cock-a-doodles. A lazy Brahmapootra
was last with a measly 10 doodles. The cock-crowing
contest will probably catch on, unless it is eclipsed by a
worm-catching contest for hens.

Pretty well the same players play in much the
same old way, with very nearly the same results, year
after year for the amateur billiard supremacy of N.S.W.
The uninitiated onlooker, who knows what an amateur
athlete should be, finds himself sorely puzzled trying to
think out what a billiard amateur really is—this through
seeing him under other conditions at other times and
places. Last week the holder (M. Spencer) emphasised
his right to the title, by beating in the final his fellow-
finalist of the previous year—ex-champion J. B. Belfield —
by 133. Play was mostly slow and uninteresting, and
almost an exact repetition of that shown by the same
pair 12 months before. There’s nothing to enthuse over
in amateur billiards in Sydney.

The meeting of the hitherto unbeaten baseball
teams, Paddington (which holds the premiership) and
Woollahra, at Rushcutters Bay (Sya.), resulted in disaster
to Paddington. Jawbone Neild’s suburb behaved as
though he had been reciting poetry at it, and played
a wretched game. Woollahra put its ears right back, and
its best leg right forward, and won by 24 points to 12.
Woollahra now walks alone at the head of the list with
16 points to its own cheek, and Paddington plods respect-
fully behind it with a plain dozen.

The licking by 5 to 1 which Marrickville
lacrossers inflicted on Burwood will teach the fellows
from the capitalistic suburb to always keep one eye on
their own back-yard. Marrickville played a good defen-
sive game, and at the slightest opening made for the
rather carelessly guarded goal of their opponents. At
the last, when things were getting desperate, Henriques,
Burwood’s goal-keeper, actually came out and joined in
the attack on Marrickville’s base ; but it was too late.
At North Sydney, Balmain won by 6 to 1. Balmain
played a steady game of consistent pressure, while North
Sydney was aggressive in fits and starts.

The surprise in Sydney hurling on Saturday was
the “ bucking-up ” of Tempe-Leichhardt, a club that, right
through the first round, was invariably beaten, though it
usually put in a big struggle. Redfern was very confident,
and, starting at a gallop, scored a point and a goal in
short order. Then McGowen’s electorate was astonished
to find Tempe-Leichhardt making a great rally, and
before it knew what was happening T.-L. had scored a
goal. After that the Redferners took no chances, and
the hyphenated team let none slip, and the result was a
game that was good to see. A perspiring first half ended
with the score at 10 all. In the second half Redfern
attacked with energy, and gained a slight lead, but T.-L.
pulled itself together, and by fast play scored the third
goal, and regained the lead by two points. After that
Redfern snorted with disgust, and its game became a
tearing, howling fray. Result: T.-L., 16; Redfern, 15.

The wrestling match between Clarence Weber
and Buttan Singh will eventuate at Fitzgeralds’ Circus
building, Melbourne, on the night of Saturday, July 1.
Prayers are being offered up for the success of the white
man, and athletes who have not yet prayed will please
take this as an intimation to do so at once. The Pathan
party doesn’t feel so delightfully sure as it did ; it begins to
think about what Hackenschmidt taught the Australian.
Weber is quite big enough to get the “ giant swing ” on
with Buttan if he has the knowledge and strength to do
it—and Buttan doesn’t like the swing. Anyway, the
Pathan will find the Australian a very much tougher
customer than when he choked him into insensibility in
the previous meeting. Weber says that now, when he
understands it, Singh is quite welcome to have his strangle
hold thrown in. But to give it would be foolish. Buttan
would want next to scratch and bite.

Balmain Cycling Club (amateur) which has
already won one Dunlop Inter-Club Premiership Shield
for its very own, is out after the second bauble with
which the big tyre company has replaced the thing used
by the gods in the Iliad to stop blue metal. If the club
can only win a few more shields it will be able to go out
for its club runs in the form of a Roman tortoise. On
Saturday there were nearly 1000 cyclists out at Home-
bush to see the first heats' won by Balmain and Enfield
Clubs. Eastern Suburbs, Annandale, Marrickville and
Glebe-Toxteth clubs were beaten, Annandale and Glebe-
Toxteth being biffed right out of the competition. The
remaining clubs which have to be dealt with are North
Sydney and Curzon Park. The latter is a tough proposi-
tion.

Swimmer Kieran arrived in London last
Wednesday with just 10 days in which to become
acclimatised and to prepare for the exacting Mile
Championship. To get ready for the “ King’s Cup,”
under conditions mostly new to him and which
will require a great deal of practice, he has only 17
days. Delay was caused through the fears of the Sydney
fund committee that once Kieran left subscriptions
would cease to come. “An English authority” is re-
ported in one of the Sydney dailies as having stated that
Kieran would, “ like all other swimmers from the same
part of the world who had preceded him, find the water
too cold, and consequently shape short of his best form.”
Bunkum ! Dick Cavill, Fred Lane, and Jack Hellings
performed at least as well in England as in Australia, and
one or two of Cavill’s and Lane’s feats in the Cold Country
exceeded anything they ever did in Australia before or
since. Dick Cavill had just about the same time for
preparation as Kieran before swimming - in the Mile, and
was badly beaten, but the winner—Jarvis—took care
never to meet Dick afterwards excepting in the long
distance (sm. 60yd.) event which took place on the Thames
two weeks later.

Neil-Williams fight, at the new Melbourne
Athletic Club (formerly the “ Demo.”), was a lively 20-
round strife. Neil’s usual smothering tactics did not
prevent Williams pushing a useful left all over his face till
the alterations in his countenance were quite noticeable.
Williams showed a lot of Clever footwork throughout.
Round five saw Neil floored and groggy, just able to stay
till the gong went. The remaining rounds were very even
fighting. Some of Neil’s blows were rather low and wild,
and his opponent’s small and dodgy head evaded most of
the Yankee’s endeavors. Referee Basto awarded Wil-
liams the victory on points. A large and critical audience
accepted the fight as a good display of science mingled
w'ith gore.
For a pretty display of crafty boxing, the Keys-
Turner meeting at Sydney National Sporting Club, last
week, was a champion exhibition. Turner was looking
for gore, but owing to the deft way Ilock would hit him
three times in each eye and then clinch, or simply slide
out of reach, Turner was unable to find what he sought.
Hock’s treble-action blows, in which he appears to hit his
victim three times off one lunge, are curious to watch. If
only Keys had some stamina, some steam, or some plain
devil behind them, they would be very destructive. But
as Keys works them, they are merely bright exhibitions.
The glove contest was awarded to Keys on points, no
other verdict being possible.

For a vigorous, enthusiastic banging match, the
little disturbance at Sydney Ga:°ty Club between Micko
Walsh, of Melbourne, and Ned Murphy, featherweight
champion of Australia, would be hard to surpass. It was
cheerful while it lasted, but it was painfully brief,
although in all probability the man who got so suddenly
banged out was quite satisfied with the duration of it.
They rained blows upon each other, and Walsh stopped
a couple with his chin, swayed, caught another on the
frame of his eye, and went down bang. On rising he
caught a whirly-wirly on the jaw, and collapsed once
more. Before he could be counted out, the thing you
dry your face with was thrown up. There was no doubt
about the genuineness of that fight.

WHY DON’T YOU
Walk on Soft and Springy
Dunlop Rubber Heels?
The benefit and comfort derived is out of all proportion to the
small cost of fitting these Durable Rubber Heels. They
outwear two or three pairs of leather heels, besides absorbing
all jarring incidental to walking on hard pavements.
Don’t buy hard, cheap-grade compound heels. Specify DUNLOP’S.
ill Tit 8 V being soft, springy, and hard-wearing. Made
in all sizes, for Ladies and Gents. Obtainable all respectable boot shops.

It is up to John Stinson, Geo. Pile, and G.
Reid to cable promptly to tlie King drawing his
attention to the fact that the little Prince of
Wales is undermining the throne and putting the
sanctity of the ’ome in deadly peril. The proof
of it is in a cable which mentions that Wales the
other day, “ inaugurated the London County
Council’s steamboat service on the Thames.”
This is the newest bit of Socialism in England ;
and Socialism, according to the most eminent
members of the Bogey party in Australia, means
chaos for the King, the Crown, and the home.
These things evidently haven’t occurred to either
Edward or his advisers, else, no doubt, the
little prince would have been already cast
into a dark, damp dungeon ; and it is the obvious
duty of J. Stinson and G. Pile, as the leaders
of the one clear-sighted party in the Empire, to
open the Royal eyes. It may be a hard thing for
a father to cut off the career of a son in the full
flush of his early manhood ; but the father, as J.
Stinson and the rest will no doubt point out,
must remember that he is a King as well as a
parent. The alternative, of course, is that Wales
didn’t know what he was doing. But that is ab-
surd ; for when Wales was in Australia, didn’t
the Stinson-Pile party assure him over and over
again that he was the very embodiment of wisdom
and knew practically everything ?
»
One amazing circumstance about the
Dunedin (M.L.) police-burglary cases is that ex-
Constable Moses, who got five years “hard,” had
two previous convictions against him. How he
gained admission to the force is a mystery. Moses
certainly went looting in S’Africa with one of the
first contingents, as many bad characters did, and
got into the Permanent Artillery on his return, but
on applying to be drafted to the police an official
was told off to report on his character and past
career. Apparently it was a time when officials
didn’t inquire very hard about the ex-cohen-
tingenter, so Policeman Moses —the mere fact of a
policeman being named Moses should have aroused
suspicion—had a chance to wear a uniform and
burgle liberally when people thought he was
guarding their property. The other two police-
men, who got three and four years respectively,
for breaking into the peaceful homes of Dunedin,
appear to have been led away by Moses. People
named Moses have been leading citizens, ever
since that old unpleasantness in Exodus. The
Commissioner, by the way, has issued a pathetic
appeal asking that the public will still have faith
in the integrity of the force in spite of Moses, but
the public would like first of all to know how
many more ex-farm-burners there are in that
misguided body.
Now that the Victorian Labor leagues have
taken up the question of electing a convention to
draw up a scheme for amalgamating the many
municipalities of Melbourne into a Greater Mel-
bourne, there seems a chance of something being
done. As soon as the matter is taken out of the
hands of aldermen and entrusted to a popular
Convention, elected on any kind of a liberal fran-
chise, success becomes possible. And when Labor
leagues take up matters like this, and show that
they have a platform broad enough to take in all
great public questions, and not only those that are
strictly labor questions, their position cannot but
improve. It is only the want of a sufficiently wide
platform which prevents the Labor party domi-
nating Australia.

From Edmund Downey’s recently published book of
reminiscences : “ The danseuses at a rehearsal of ‘ Faust’
were conducting themselves a little frivolously at one of
the demon scenes, when the ballet-master was heard to
say, 1 Now, then, lydies, recollect you ain’t dancing on
’Ampstead ’Eath ; you’re dancing in ’ell.’ ”
Dan Fitzgerald, of the circus, leaves shortly for New
Caledonia, in search of sunshine undiluted with cold
wind.
W. S. Gilbert’s stern suppression of gags in his Savoy
operas was led up to by the havoc made of his earlier
plays by gagging comedians, in the days when he was not
a large enough personage to command obedience. About
the worst offender was J. B. Buckstone, who packed with
heavy grossness of his own the character of Chrysos in
“ Pygmalion and Galatea ” —a part well played recently in
Sydney by G. W. Carey.
“ Melb.” : Miss O’Neil, in “ Magda,” shows us why she
failed in London and next time she goes there she may be
treated with respect. Her first act, the second of the
play, was formerly infused with a crude power, quite out
of keeping. She failed to recognise that Magda was a
highly-cultured woman of the world. She has taken her-
self to pieces, and put herself together again, with blends
of Duse, Bernhardt, and Mrs. Campbell. Whether she
saw them or not, I don’t know, but they all seem to be
there. She is strikingly like Bernhardt in some moments.
She follows Duse’s example, in eschewing make-up in the
third and fourth acts. Very courageous, for she looks
almost plain, but there is truth and reality.
Grace Palotta’s singing lessons in Vienna and Paris, of
which she wrote so much to fond friends on this side,
have evidently spoilt even the tootle tricks she employed
successfully out here. A ’Frisco paper remarks :
“ Grace Palotta, who seems to be regarded as the biggest
fish among the new-comers, is a good-looking young
woman, with a vivacious expression and a tendency to
sing all out of tune. But she is rather dashing in boy’s
clothes, and is so blissfully unconscious of her deviations
from the correct pitch that people accept her as some-
thing to look at and not to listen to.”
Brough and Flemming are advertising their “ Walls of
Jericho ” comedy with a fac-simile letter from a cockney
vicar which is quite interesting, for its simple admission
that the giddiest people for the most part never go to
church to get moral lessons. “ Your play,” wrote the
shepherd, “ must either fail utterly, or it must make the
Smart Set writhe. Why we clergy are so keen on what
you are doing is, I fancy, this : We are for ever trying to
preach such truths —but we never have the audience.
The Mormons are not there. A West End theatre is a
place of worship they still attend, and they have got to
listen to what you say, and I think it must flash a sudden
light into many a long-drugged conscience.” The un-
conscious jealousy in the holy man’s reference to the
helpless condition of the theatre audiences is quite
pathetically expressed, “They have got to listen.” In
the church they avoid it by going to sleep. In the
theatre they are too much interested to sleep.
San Francisco Examiner publishes a hugely-illustrated
interview with Lydia Yeamans-Titus in which her hus-
band, the trim and voluble Titus, has most to say. Titus
talks of the wayback time when a gallery interruption of
his wife’s musical monologues lifted him from his seat on
the piano-stool and made him outwardly and inwardly
mad. “ I used to get up and raise the very devil with the
audience. I used to make gestures and holler at them.
But not now ; you won’t find me doing that now.” Lydia
remarks that Titus is “getting wise,” and his rational
estimate of the labor involved in earning their joint
salary suggests that he is at least wiser than his average
brother pro. Titus doesn’t claim compassion for his
clever little wife on account of her mental strain, and so
forth. He doesn’t talk of “the wear and tear of an
artist’s life ” like some of the music-hall toilers, who sing
three songs a night and change their precious ditties
twice a year. He says : “ We’ve been living together for
twenty-one years, and we don’t feel a day older than when
we started. In this business it’s the pace that ages you.
Tiiere isn’t enough work in vaudeville to kill a fly. The
pace is for those that care to run it. Our greatest dissi-
pation after the show is an apple and a biscuit.”
Bruce Smith, who gave it as one of the
reasons why he should be returned to the Federal
Parliament that “he had never sent any of his
children to a Roman Catholic school,” now raises
a sectarian issue in connection with his precious
Empire League. “ None but Protestant schools,”
he said, “ had joined in the Empire celebrations.”
The statement was not a fact—Smith had to back
down a moment later by saying that he referred
only to the metropolitan schools, and even that
qualified statement was probably not a fact. But
why should Smith, who declares he never sent any
of his children to a R.C. school, mention it, unless
to raise again the sectarian snakes ? The Reid-
Srnith anti-Socialism will be found, before the
elections come on, to resolve itself into sectarian-
ism.
London Daily Mail, on the word of its
alleged Sydney correspondent, lately set going an
amazing Stinking Fish yarn, which has been
grabbed by almost every other English paper that
happens along. The yarn was to the effect that
“ the White Australia law” is such an absurdity
that —
The Ormuz, the first Orient liner arriving here under
the new contract, reports that white labor is unsatisfac-
tory. The purser and another officer spent hours at
Adelaide Police Court, yesterday, in connection with
drunken firemen. It is stated that the engine-room was
often left in a disgraceful condition.
Then follow weird particulars, in an English
paper, of the utter worthlessness of the Englishman
when compared with the Lascar. It would be an
amazing thing for Englishmen to gloat over even
if it were true ; but, seeing that none of the
Ormuz firemen landed at Adelaide, and that the
whole yarn regarding the Adelaide Police Court is
a lie, it is more amazing than ever. The Daily
Mail ought to re-christen itself the Dibty Fowl.
“ Squidge,” who, for all we know, is a
reliable person, tells this :
The other day, in Melbourne Town Hall, the Vic. Free-
masons held a big fella corroboree and installed Dr.
Balls-Headley as Boss Grand Panjandrum. At every
door of the Town Hall two old persons of antic disposi-
tion stood in dress-clothes (it was the middle of the after-
noon) and sheepskin sporrans, with great bands of silk
round their necks, and little tin things dangling from
the bands, and with two little curved swords in
their hands, to keep off intruders. They demanded
entry cards from all who tried to pass them, and those
who were not provided with tickets had one of the idiotic
little swords presented at their hearts. About half-past
3 Yes-No Reid hove in sight. He was arrayed in full
evening get-up, and carried in his hand a black case con-
containing his ham frill, sporran, and tin danglements.
He hoisted his protuberant fulness up the steps, and
arrived panting in front of the sentries. They barred the
way with their toy swords. Georgie grinned.
“ Ticket, please,” said one, in a cringing bow-to-the-
ground tone of voice.
Georgie grinned more than ever, and did a bit of panto-
mimic business with his arms.
“Oh yes, we don’t doubt that,” the sentry replied to
the pantomime. “But you cannot go in without a
ticket.”
“But, you see,” said Yes-No, “I’ve forgotten it. I
really must get in. They are expecting me. I promised
to come, and I am here. Really, you know, this is too
absurd. Of course, you know who I am. I am George
Reid—the Prime Minister, you know—and I’m”
George reeled off the story of Masonic things that he was,
“ Yes, yes,” said the phantom, firmly. “We know who
you are, Mr. Reid, and we’re sorry; but you can’t go ii..”
“But I must,” persisted Georgie.
“ You can’t,” echoed the apparitions sternly, and pre-
pared to repel the boarders with the tin toothpicks.
Yes-No argued some more, but it was no use. The
sentries could not be blandished, and George, his mous-
tache bristling with rage and his eye-glass flashing like a
heliograph gone mad, was not foolish enough to risk a
puncture. He turned on his heel and stamped off down
the steps again, muttering some awful Masonlo remarks.
Mr. P. M. GREEN, Culbertson, Neb., writes :
—“ During the THIRTY YEARS that I have been using
Jayne’s Expectorant, both I and other members of my
family have been oured by it of some VERY SEVERE
COLDS.’’*
Adelaide Advertiser’s London correspondent:—
I have it on the very best authority that there is a very
strong opinion in influential naval circles that it would
make for England’s naval efficiency and national safety to
treat the whole navy as a homogeneous force, in which
there should be no “China,” or “Mediterranean,” or
“ Australian ” squadrons, except for the purposes of dis-
tinction and convenience of nomenclature; that
all these squadrons should really form one force,
and should be concentrated or distributed and
ordered about as parts of one whole, and without
regard to the sectional considerations affecting
British North America, or South Africa or Australia.
I am speaking by the book when I say that the Austra-
lian precedent of an ear-marked squadron is condemned
at the Admiralty ; that it was accepted (largely through
Mr. Chamberlain’s influence when Colonial Secretary) for
“Imperial” reasons; that there are those at the Ad-
miralty who think that the policy to be put into
operation should be one navy for the whole Empire,
and pro rata contributions for its maintenance from
each and every part of the Empire; and that
failing the adoption of this policy the Australian contri-
bution should be permitted to lapse at the expiry of the
present agreement, and the Australian squadron re-incor-
porated with the rest of the navy when and wherever
required. I have not met one naval expert in England
whose opinions do not run more or less on these lines, hut
for State reasons they do not find publicity. Still it is as
well that you should know that this is the trend of
Admiralty opinion—that, curiously enough, they favor
the “Australian party s” policy of two or three years ago,
that Australia should keep its contribution and prom Ste
its own navy for local defence, and that the British navy
should be maintained for the defence of the Empire in
whole or in part.

D.C.L. is the one and only “damp” policy in

sive achievement..
The Socialistic settlement which, after a
long t: l.tl, broke down, and thus proved conclu-
sively that Gr. H. Reid should be Premier of
Australia, is beginning to get the same habits as
the capitalist who was going to invest £137,892 Is.
in a new industry, but that the Labor party pre-
vented him. Sydney Telegraph, last-Saturday,
printed a two-column yarn of an alleged personal
experience on an alleged Socialist settlement, with-
out once mentioning even what continent it was
on.
“ Smith Anctfrnlinn Trndp • Homo Maun

factures Holding Their Own,” the Freetrade
papers scare-head a recent report of the S. Aus.
Y. y, . . . .
Collector of Customs in their backstairs cam-
paign against higher duties. And then, in
type which isn’t of the scare-head variety, it is
remarked that in agricultural-implement making,
which was the State’s most important line, the
foreigner is knocking the Australian manufacturer
out under the tariff which G-. Reid whittled away;
that the whisky-distilling business has been simi-
larly knocked out; that the foreign importations
0 f hats and caps have increased ; that the foreign
flannels, flannel shoddy and woollens jumped from
£154,000 to £179,000; that foreign boots and shoes
are coming in at a greater rate than before; and
that local cigar manufacturers “ complain that it is
impossible to compete with the imported article
under the present tariff. ” Still, according to the
lying scare-head, “home manufactures are holding
their own”! But even if they were, what a
miserable business it would be—just to stagnate,
to petrify, to remain where we were, to be
stationary, in short, to “hold our own!” The
Yankee doesn’t want to hold his own ; he wants
to hold the earth.

Mr. A. ANDERSEN says In a recent letter:—
Thomas-street, Bayswater,
Brisbane, 14/9/’93.
“To whom it may concern thi» is to certify that
I was afflicted with an intensely painful bladder
complaint for two years, and at last I ventured
to undergo treatment. After consulting my regu-
lar practitioner with no avail, I called upon your pro-
gressive Institute and through your skill and efficiency am
now perfectly restored to health.”
Mr. HERBERT MULLEN, of Avoca, Tas., writes:—
“Thanks to your attention to my case I am now
thoroughly well and happy. The ailments I suffered with
were of very old standing, and, through ignorance and
want of a word of warning when young, I was almost
beyond cure, I know, when you took me in hand. Well,
I laid myself out to follow your orders, and you have saved
me from a very unhappy ending to my life. You have
earned my heart’s deepest gratitude.”
Mr. DAVID O’KEEFE, Beaoonfleld, Tas., writes :
“ I have worked very hard indeed lately, and am able
to do. my portion just as well as the best of my mates,
thanks to your wonderful treatment and skilL"
Mr. B. H. PEARD, of Mulwala, Vlo., writes :
“ I must say I am very highly pleased at kind treat-
ment and skill received at the Institute, for you have
treated me in a very straightforward and clever manner,
and every way I am bow feeling a different man."
Mrs. POWER, of Queensland, writes
“lam happy to say my health has been for some time
past, and now is, very good since you treated me, and I
thank you for what you did for me, as I thought I never
would be well.”
[This was one of the most severe and deep-seated cases
ever we were called upon to treat, and our success is
testified to by the lady who is now cured.]
Mr. THOS. BROWNE, a resident of Bundabergr, Queens-
land, thus describes our treatment
“ You have worked a most wonderful cure in me, and
although I am over 60 years of age now, yet now I oan
beat men of half my years at the end of the day s toil. I
feel rrateful to Mr. Geo. Oooksley for recommending me
to you, but more so to you, gentlemen, for the great oare
bestowed upon my health.
Mr. P. W. CATES’ (Meaksrlng, West Australia) testl-
' mony has reached us, reading thus i—
“I am glad of the great improvement following your
treatment, and send this as a testimonial to your profes-
sional abilities. There is only ons thing that I have
aeainsi your system, and that is, I shall havs to ret now
“rigs eut," for the clothes I had before beginning with
vour treatment are now far too small. I overheard a con-
versation between a Northam doctor and a friend of mute,
and the former said I had now the healthiest faos hi has
ever seen in Northam. This speaks volumto far the
treatment.”
Mr. E. B. HARRIB, sf Ohlnohllla, Queensland, says i—
“ I have much pleasure in attesting the sxtremsly effl-
cacious treatment given me by the Freeman abb Wallacs
Institute I was suffering from acute Nephritis and Ho-
ratio Troubles, but got no relief from anyone until I wrote
and described my case to them. To-day lam happy and
healthy again, and feel it is all due to the wonderful
ability of the Specialists, who were greatly handicapped
in never seen me, hut h&d te treet hy their
efficient correspondence system.”
Ir. A. L. KEBY, sf Dandsnong Road, Molbeunto, writes
thus i—
“I cannot help expressing my thanks to yo« for the
iraightforward manner in which you have acted towards
te I had been ailing for over II years with a oough and
ronobitis, and all my organs were badly disarranged ; in
ict, six months ago, when I oame to you, I was a oom-
lete wreck, suffering from severe weakness. I can safely
Ate vou have done me more gpood in the six months than

feci quite a different man, and as Specialists I consider
ou in the highut ranks.”

was Eventually Cured*
lr. Q. V. THOMPSON, sf Cue, W.A.. writes
“I must admit I began your medicines without much
one but still from what others told me I mid I would
ive vou a trial, and the result has been wonderfully suo-
>ssful. From a walking skeleton of Bst. 51bs., I have gone
) I2st. 81bs. in six months, and all the traces of my
irmcr troubles are going rapidly. In feet, if it were not
our wishes, I should not continue with the medicines
ow for I am really better than ever I was, and feel I
ould not be stronger and healthier. What a boon health
i-you told me that in your first letter-and I know how
me it is new. May you he bleeeed in your good work.”
The Director and Principal ot Institute,
Mr. HOWARD FREEMAN.
WHEN doctors differ to whom should the siok man turn? Not to his friends or
relatives. They are good enough for sympathy. But sympathy won t oure
disease. It won’t even palliate it. It may only tend to produce and maintain
melancholia, and melancholia feeds disease.
The sick man should turn to the Specialist who is a dootor in Men’s Diseases. All
doctors are not Specialists, anymore than a rifle is a gun. They belong to the same class,
but are essentially different. A man suffering from Rupture should consult a Specialist in
that disease, as a man with diseased eyes should consult an eye doctor.
Talking about Specialists, one is at once reminded of the great skill of the Medical
Experts of
THE
FREEMAN & WALLACE
ELECTRO-M€PKAL INSTITUTE,
Sydney and Melbourne, who cure and treat only various forms of MEN’S DISORDERS
due to specific weakening causes and over-taxation of the physical body. Their specialities
are principally those diseases which affect the Genito-Urinary Systems, or that brief tract of
the body beginning with the Kidneys and Ureters, and ending with the Bladder Canal.
THESE DISEASES ARE ALL DANGEROUS, but are mostly curable by the Specialist s
prompt and effective methods of treatment.

practice modern methods of treatment. Hence the suocess of the Institute in permanent cures it has effected.
A GOOD BOOK.— It tells every Weak Man how to get strong. It explains the reason for the Early
Decay of Manhood’s Strength and how Perfect Vigor is restored. It tells how we have cured thousands of weak
men in Australia during the past five years. It is a beautifully illustrated 600-page book. To any man who
suffers from an early breaking down of the Vital Powers it is invaluable. ” CLINICAL EXPERIENCES,”

you Nothing. Send for it to-day. Post Free. No Charge.
YOUNG , MIDDLE-AGED,
or OLD MEN.
Our Specialists ask you to read the
following statements eonoerning Serious
Diseases. They will appeal to you. If
you similarly suffer, consult us and be
cured.
VARICOCELE.
We can cure this disease without operation,
and under our treatment the congested
blood vessels, within ten days, disappear.
The parts are restored to their natural
condition, vigor and strength, and circu-
lation is re-established br electricity and
electro-medication. It is the twentieth cen-
tury treatment.
RUPTURE.
We eure in 30 days, without operation or
hypodermic injection. No use in wearing
trusses. Our treatment is painless, blood-
less, and with no detention from business.
Old standing or maltreated cases especially
invited. These, of course, tax all the skill
that science can devise to palliate condi-
tions oreated by maltreatment, apathy or
neglect. Our methods are those of Con-
tinental scientists.
“WEAKNESS" IN MEN.
Weakness is merely a symptom brought on
by early dissipation or improper treatment of
contracted diseases. The oure lies in restor-
lng the system to it» normal healthy state.
This we accomplish rapidly without the use
ol a long course of internal remedies.
NERVO-VITAL DEBILITY.
There is certainly no victim of Nerve-Vital
Debility but who hopes to be rejuvenated
some time. Our special treatment for this
trouble, varied to suit each case, is an unfail-
ing cure, to which a vast army of restored
men to-day owe their happy condition in life.
URINARY AILMENTS.
We cure without the knife or instrument
by an application which acts directly on the
parts affected, dissolving the trouble com-
pletely, by our galvanic electrical medical
treatment. It is painless, and in nowise in-
terferes with your business duties.
KIDNEY TROUBLE.
We cure all irritation, stoppage, pain in
back, brickdust sediment, and catarrhal con-
dition. We cure to stay cured. We do not
experiment. Kidney troubles may be deadly
destructive, bo not trifle with them or they
will kill you.
PILES.
We cure without operation in 10 days ; no
detention from business ; no acid injection
or ligatures used. Electricity and gentle
medication. This system is adopted by the
most scientific Continental practitioners,
who have intimately studied these distressing
complication, which are so prevalent in Aus-
tralia.

The little Australian who can’t notice a
wedding-ring on his mother’s finger has nearly
three chances of dying within his first year to the
ether little Australian’s one. Last year, in
N.S.W., 74 of every 1000 “ legitimates” died ; of
; ae other sort, 192 per 1000. And yet the little
Australian is the most desirable immigrant Aus-
• ra lia can have; and the chances are that the
little Australian who doesn’t pass through the
wedding-ring would make just as good and
vigorous an Australian as the other. But still
Australia lets him die, what time it listens to
Bruce Smith pleading for the admission of Yet
Sing and Chudder Bhong.
Curious how Britain lags behind in some
things. Our old friend Hopetoun, now Secretary
for Scotland, lately received a deputation from the
Scotch Society of Agriculture, which protested
against the new Bill for requiring vehicles to carry
lights at night. Hopetoun assured the bucolics
that they needn’t worry—the Bill couldn’t possibly
become law. And apparently it won’t, so carts
and waggons will continue to crawl in thick dark-
ness all over Scotland, and smash up any lighter
traffic that comes along. A few of the English
counties have accepted the reform, but only as a
result of independent action by their county
counoils.

THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as *'run-down " or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway’s Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
Is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every
kind, and should be used in conjunction with the
Pills. It is also the speediest remedy for Rheu-
matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,
Holloway’s Ointment affords most welcome relief
in a very short time.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
i he sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

A letter from Timaru (Maoriland) :
I know a man who always takes his washing to Ohow
laundrymen, and who is always boasting how superior
they are to the white wash-lady. The other day he was
called upon by a policeman, who asked him if he had ever
had any white shirts stolen. He said he hadn’t. “ Well,"
said the man in blue, “we ran in some Chows on Sunday
night, and one had a shirt on with your name on it."
Then the patron of the Chow launder hurried to the
police station and rescued his property. He found a
number of well-known citizens similarly employed.
Violent inquiry revealed that when a yellow person wants
to do the dude, he never buys the boiled garment of
civilisation. He simply goes to a Chow washhouse and
borrows a white man’s shirt for a small gratuity.
“ It is notorious that men grow more
rapidly tired of aotresses and the professionally
light-hearted—whether they follow them or marry
them—than they ever do of women who lead
quiet lives.”—John Oliveb Hobbes.
“ M.G.” : Brown, next door to me, owned
a “dorg”—a mongrel of an Irish terrier. The
derned animal yelped all day and wouldn’t even
leave the neighboring cats in peace at night. I
did most of my writing at home, and with the
noise of my kids and the dog next door I could
scarcely hear myself compose my literary master-
pieces. I could see no way of getting rid of the
youngsters, but was determined to “do away”
with Brown’s yelping animal. Asked Brown how
much he would take for it. He said “ two quid.”
It was scarcely worth registration fee, but I bought
it at his price. That night the dog and I took a
trip across the harbor in the ferry, and when
about half-way across there was one dog less, and
Brown’s animal was no more. A couple of days
later I came home at dusk and heard a noise like
the howl of a hungry dingo, or the wail of a book-
maker’s ghost. “Struth!” I said—“what’s
that?” “That’s Brown’s new dog!” my wife
answered.


HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to

of lime and soda we have an
admirable remedy for all these
things and especially for the
after-results, which are often
more prolonged and more de-

selves. Mr. Atkinson’s case is
typical of a thousand. From
the Government Labour Farm,
Pitt Town, Windsor, N. S. W.,
under date of August 18th, 1904,
he wrote us as follows :
“ I have always been a sufferer from
bronchitis, and could not obtain any
permanent relief, although I tried
various remedies. From the first dose
Scott’s Emulsion benefited me. It
agreed well with me, and was quite
palatable. After taking it for a little
while, iny cough was completely cured
and I have gained weight and feel
altogether much stronger and better
in general health.”
Exactly ! Scott’s Emulsion goes
to the root of the trouble —sets
to work instantly to build up the

vital man, and this
is the kind of man
which Scott’s Emul-

cause it strengthens the Liver,
Bowels and Kidneys whilst
at the same time thoroughly
but very gently cleansing the
sluggish system. Its great

many attendant ills.

Proserpine (N.Q.) Guardian appeared, the other Satur-
day printed on heavy, dark-brown wrapping paper-
tftfee shades a darker brown than Proserpine s own
Tommy Tanna ; and this was the leading article :
“ The fates have been treating us to more than our share
of bad luck this week. First our editor, who is also
comp., etc., gets the dengue and has to retire to bed.
Then we find our supply of paper has been left in Mackay ,
therefore this issue is only being produced with the kind
assistance of friends. What will happen with the next
issue, time alone will tell. But we hope fate will be more
kind by then.”
And it would be a scurvy fate if it wasn’t. A battler who
nuts his editor and staff to bed, and then finds his paper-
store empty, and still brings out the weekly issue,
deserves three columns of new advts. and a rush of fresh
subscribers.

The following is an extract from a letter recently sent
in by a rejected contributor: “ I have been taking your
journal for years and I may tell you candidly that it has
fell away a great deal this last few years the only reason I
can come to is this your correspondence are full up of the
way you treat their respective manuscript I mean good
contributor* that does not write rot.— l remain, your*

The Inky Way.
John Norton issues his Maoriland paper at Welling-
ton. As the violent little gentleman With the bald
head hinted lately that, being in Maoriland, he supposed
he must do as Maorilanders do, it is inferred that the
paper will boil like the local geyser and blfcw up like the
local volcano.
* • • *
Mr. J. 0. L. Fitzpatrick, who succeeds Mr. R. J. Baker
on the Molong Argos, has a definite idea of what a
country newspaper should be. “ Leave the city papers
to create national feeling ; limit yourself to looking after
local feeling.” That was the history of his career on the
Hawkesbury, and the result was financially good.
From the journalist’s standpoint, Vandemonia is the
Slough of Despond. Salaries are generally most pitiful.
The leading paper expects to get first-class reporters for
£3 a week, and pays some members of its staff much
less. Another daily pays its editor £3 aweek, and works
him hard ; and the offices are notorious for their meanness
in the matter of expenses.
* * * *
Vic. Labor caucus recently spent some hours in discuss-
ing the formation of a Labor daily, towards which they
have secured £7OOO. Much more than that sum is re-
quired before any serious start should be made ; and, in
the undertaking, the Laborites should remember that,
most of all, they have to fear themselves. The public
asks first for a paper which gives it news, and news served
up brightly, and with a due sense of proportion. The
sentiments professed in the leading columns are only a
secondary consideration with most readers, and, though
a citizen be a most sincere believer in every plank of the
Labor platform, he will cease subscribing to the paper if
he finds that the Argus or Age ‘ ‘ scoops ” his favorite organ
several times a week. Good news means good men, and these
are not to be obtained without money. The ranks of
Labor are full of persons with the journalistic itch, who
imagine that because, with plenty of time and plenty of
paper, they can turn out an eloquent diatribe against
the Tory, they are qualified to take a place on a news-
paper. If the Labor paper is formed, these men will
rush for the billets and feel they have been treated most
treacherously if they do not get them. If the manage-
ment has any sense they won’t get them. It will pay the
Labor paper to buy up the best men from the administra-
tive staffs of existing papers, together with their best
reporters ; and that means giving them better pay than
Toryism now gives them. One of the worst points about
all labor organisations is their meanness in the matter of
wao-es. It will be a very difficult matter to convince the
directorate of the new paper that its star reporters
should get quite as much as a member of the Australian
Parliament, but if they don’t acquire that conviction they
will get no star reporters. If the expected happens, and
ex-members of the Trades Hall Council are put on to do
the reporting, the paper will be bor.i dead. There is no-
thing that the journalist—Democratic or Tory
resents more than an attempt to bring down
wages. The reporters of the two existing papers
will take good care that the cheap new reporter gets left,
and everybody familiar with press work knows that a
combination of two against one in news-getting means
the defeat of the minority almost every time. The
directorate also needs to take aback seat in the adminis-
tration of the paper. A good man should be secured as
editor, with a five years’ engagement. He should be given
the platform of the paper, and, provided he keeps within
its lines, he should be given an absolutely free hand as to
his methods and management. There are great possi-
bilities before a well-managed Labor paper. It would
pay some unprejudiced, smart capitalist with business
instincts to start one for his own profit, and denounce
himself and all his friends, and his ways, and his friends’
ways, in its columns ; but the outlook of any paper with
a host of managers is not bright, and when those
managers are leading members of a political party, it
almost become! gloomy-
“Viking”: For the information of the illiterate
(including editors and others), I would like to say
that it is a very improper thing to take an adjective
derived from a proper noun and to attempt, by adding
“ er ” to such adjective, to make another proper noun
having precisely the same meaning as the first. It is also
a waste of ink. It would indeed be a sad sight for a
Briton to see a Britisher helping a Japaneser to smash a
Russianer because the latter had hurt a Chineser s feel-
ings by aiding a Germaner to take a Portuguese-sneezer s
man-o’-war from a Turkisher. Such a proceeding would
rouse a Mexican Greaser to fury.

In the Contemporary Review Alfred Kinnear arrives at
the conclusion that the verbatim Parliamentary report in
the daily papers is a thing of the past. British Parlia-
mentary debates are no longer interesting enough to con-
stitute the best feature of a newspaper, or to justify, as
they onee did, an ornamental expenditure. John Bull s
taste has changed ; the long, close-set speech has ceased
to pay. Even the Parliamentary “ front-rankers have
to be cut ruthlessly nowadays. Five years ago, Rosebery
was worth a full report; he is now saleable to the Press
as a whole at from half to three-quarter column. Cham-
berlain, worth at the outset of his fiscal propaganda two
columns out of every three delivered, has depreciated
greatly. Balfour, once worth a full report, now “goes
at a Times “ turn-over,” say a column and a little bit.
Asquith and Campbell-Bannerman are saleable best on the
half-column scale. Within the last two years four first-
class London morning dailies have discharged their Par-
liamentary reporters and handed the business over to the
Press Agencies, and now the only City dailies which have
special Gallery staffs are the Times, Daily Telegraph and
Morning Post. Provincial dailies represented in the
Gallery are the Scotsman, Glasgow Herald, Freeman’s
Journal and Manchester Guardian.
BALLAD OF THE EVENING TOAD.
POLITICAL POINTS
’Twas the Evening Toad newspaper, and its editor-in-
charge
Was a milingtary person whose views were very large.
The office called him “ kernel ” —and ’twas said that
sudden sack
Would descend upon the party who guffawed behind his
back 1
’Twas a milingtary p.’.per—it was extra-fond of blood,
And its “leaders” smote the Russians with a deadly
evening thud.
But the war had slumped to zero—aye, the war was
baggy-kneed,
And the editor was troubled at the dreadful dearth of
screed.
So he placed a hostile sentry with a cannon at his door,
And deliberated fiercely for an hour or two or more I
In the silence of the sanctum he evolved a mighty
scheme,
And its glories rose before him like the glories of a
dream.
Twas the Evening Toad newspaper, and it went to press
that eve
And told the sodden city news that made the city grieve.
But the most depressing feature fulminated by its pens
Was a mighty Referendum on the Ten Best Citizens 1
But the kernel stuck his chest out, and informed his
aide-de-cong
That the paper’s circulation would be multiplied ere
long.
And the aide-de-cong assented; then went home and told
his Pa,
That the Toad was even sillier than most newspapers
are !
But his Pa’s opinions differed —as they generally do—
For he basked in church each Sunday next a knighted
person’s pew.
So the ballot first unfolded by the milingtary gent
Emanated from that father... and it mentioned Thomas
Bent;
’Twas the Evening Toad newspaper, and it sowed the
plague broad-cast —
Aye, the voting choked the office, and the postmen stood
aghast 1
Dear Suburbia’s sacred smugness, dear defaulting
gentlemen—
Every bankrupt straightway labored with a damp andl
reverent pen!
Every Bumble fell instanter—on his waistcoat lay
a-sprawl—
Yea, the Nicest folk joined issue in a simultaneous crawl.
Lo, the holy rushed with coppers to obtain their Evening
Toads;
Whilst the folks who led the voting bulged with pride in
their abodes.
One could read it in their faces as they paced along the
way;
And the House of Madden simpered, and the House of
Bent was gay 1
But the proudest man among them was the Man Behind
the Pen —
Aye, the milingtary Person in his milingtary den.
’Twas the Evening Toad newspaper, and it told in tram
and train
The Best Citizen was leading, and all rivalry was vain.
But somehow it failed to tell us—and the reason no man
kens —
How one vulgar ballot-paper named the Ten Worst
Citizens 1
Yea, the milingtary kernel read that list With secret woe,
And the tears of indignation must have t rickled down his
“mo.”
For the names upon that ballot were identical, in part,
With the bigwigs who were riding in the Referendum
Cart.
Give their names?—the law of libel firmly blocks the
blessed road,
Or I’d print the list omitted by the dismal Evening Toad 1
TIC.

After other treatment had failed.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l have a son, 9 years of age,
who for two .years suffered from Chronic Bronchial
Catarrh. I could never leave him away from me a night
on any consideration. Everybody just dreaded his being
lefts to their care. The least dampness of foot, cool sea
breeze after a hot day, or cold blowing wind, would con-
fine him to the house for days. I had medical advice,
and used different patent medicines, but without success,
until- I got one small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure,
which has freed him completely from the Catarrh. Since
then he has been out in damp weather to school, andgoes
about like any other child ; in fact, he seems to have lost
a big burden, and is quite well. Will you please accept
my gratitude.—Believe me, yours gratefully,

tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One

CONSUMPTION.
Too ill to leave his bed.
A complete cure
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Bear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con.
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed.
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

A Cure for fliddle Age
(By “Old Boy.”)
It always comes as a shock to a man or woman to hear that they are bein'? classed as middle-aged
people. Youth merges so gradually into age that one is apt to consider oneself young for years after
those who are really young have placed us upon the shelf of age. In all but a small minority of cases,
however, when a person gets to be over forty, a subtle diminution of energy makes itself felt.
Perhaps, if we are lucky, we have nothing special in the way of pain to growl about, but, even in
such cases, there is an indefinable something which insistently brings to our knowledge the fact that
youth has fled. In a larger proportion of instances the advance of middle age is heralded in a more
emphatic manner. The joints become stiff, twinges of gout are felt, rheumatic and neuralgic pains
be,dn to trouble, there is a sharp pain in the back when rising from a stooping posture, a good meal is
eaten with a miserable consciousness that presently we shall regret the eating, and numerous
weaknesses and aches all tend to advise us that we must begin to take more care of ourselves.
Although there is, unfortunately, no means of preventing the advance of age, it is possible to
ward off its effects for an indefinite period if adequate care is taken to see that the eliminating organs,
the kidneys and the liver, are in good working order, because the encroachments of age are ever
gradual and painless when the kidneys and liver are properly performing their functions.
The kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine
every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains
in weight of uric acid, and other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to
nearly an ounce. If the kidneys are working freely and healthily, all this solid matter leaves the body
dissolved in the urine, but if, through weakness or disease, the kidneys are unable to do their work-
properly, a quantity of these urinary substances remains in the blood and flows through the veins,.
contaminating the whole system. Then we suffer from some form of uric poisoning such as;
Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, _ Gravel, Stone,,
and Bladder Troubles. A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some:
urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning.
If it is then cloudy, shows a sediment like brickdust, is of an unnatural colour, or has particles floating
about in it, the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their
vigour, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many maifestations of uric poisoning will result.
The Liver is an automatic chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually made
from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver takes
sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it
Ito the blood, as the latter may require enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble,
into urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles which have
ived their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from some
form of biliary poisoning such as Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia, Jaundice, Sick Headache, General
Debility, and Blood Disorders.
So intimate is the relation between the work done by the kidneys, and that done by the liver,
that where there is any failure on the part of the kidneys the liver becomes affected in sympathy and
vice versa. It was the realisation of the importance of this close union of the labor of those vital
organs which resulted in the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the vvorld as Warner’s
Safe Cure. Certain medical men, knowing what a boon it would be to humanity if some medicine
could be found which would act specifically on both the kidneys and liver, devoted themselves to an
exhaustive search for such a medium, and their devotion was eventually rewarded by their success in
compounding a medicine which possesses the required quality in the fullest degree. Warner’s Safe
Cure exhibits a marvellous healing action in all cases of functional or chronic disease of the kidneys
and liver, and restoring them, as it is able to do, to health and activity, it, of necessity, cures all com-
plaints due to the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons. A vigorous action of the
kidneys and liver naturally eliminates the poisons, and troubles due to the presence of the poisons
cease. Cures effected by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent simply because they are natural. [ll].

Brogan’s Flat.
POLITICAL POINTS
IT wasn’t quite the spot an average person
would select
To study classic architecture in,
For every man in Brogan’s Flat was his own
architect,
And materialised his plans in slabs and tin.
The sun-baked street was crooked, and the houses
wide apart,
With a patch of bush between them now and
then;
But the township didn’t pride itself on literature
or art —
All its pride was concentrated on its men.
As I don’t hail from Brogan’s Flat, it don’t apply
to me;
So you can take my word this tale is true.
The people there possessed in a superlative degree
The faculty to go for all they knew.
If a Brogan’s Flat inhabitant played cards, he
played to win ;
And he always held the joker and the bower ;
But if he didn’t play at cards, then cards were
deadly sin
And a shocking waste of energy and power.
The good men there were extra good, the bad ones
very bad,
The tall men always grew extremely tall;
And every man was jolly or superlatively sad,
And they always smoked or never smoked at all.
The pious men at Brogan’s Flat spent all their
time in prayer,
The gossips spent the whole of theirs in chat;
And the teamsters on the Namoi never quite knew
how to swear
Till they’d had a final course at Brogan’s Flat.
Bill Peters kept the smithy at the west end of the
town,
And he couldn’t fit a shoe or weld a' link,
Fix a bolt for Jimmy Thompson or a nut for
Johnny Brown,
But his shibboleth was “ Comanavadrink.”
Then sounds of noisy revelry would float from
Murphy’s bar,
And be followed by a simple old refrain,
The melodies were various, but as constant as a
star
Was the chorus —it was “ Fillemupagain.”
Beyond the mill, where Brogan’s Flat extended to
the east,
Stood the forge of Jock McTavish, who would
swear
That the man who touched strong drink was more
degraded than a beast,
And that wine was a delusion and a snare.
While McTavish made a horse-shoe ’twas his
custom to inveigh
Against publicans and whisky, rum and gin,
And his preaching was as powerful while rivetting
a stay
As the blows with which he drove the rivets in.
While Peters sang a roaring song in praise of rosy
wine,
And filled himself with whisky from the still,
McTavish used to preach in praise of abstinence
divine
And sing of sparkling water from the rill.
If a stranger came to Brogan’s Flat, and entered
from the west,
The place, seemed full of drunkenness and mirth.
While the stranger from the eastward always
thought the town was blessed,
And imagined it the soberest spot on earth.
Now, although the temperance. question was
decided east and west,
In the middle Brogan’s Fiat was still in doubt;
And the middle folks consulted and decided it
was best
Just to meet and thrash the troubled problem out
So they called a public meeting and arranged for a
debate,
And the subject for discussion it was this:
“Does the cup what’s said to cheer us, and what
don’t inebriate,
Or does whisky, give the greatest share of bliss ?”
Jock McTavish championed temperance with elo-
quence and skill,
And his reasons were convincing and profound ;
While Peters fought for alcohol and whisky from
the still,
And his arguments were logical and sound.
And every point McTavish made was driven home
with force
Like his mighty sledge, his blows were hard and
true;
While the arguments that Peters used, he clinched
without remorse,
As he clinched the nails when nailing on a shoe.
When the chairman put the question, he an-
nounced, ’mid great applause,
That the voting had resulted in a tie ;
And he couldn’t give a casting vote on either side,
because
He was at a loss to give a reason why.
He had listened to the various points the speakers
dwelt upon,
And he felt convinced the meeting would agree
That the intellectual arguments delivered pro and
con.
Were just about as equal as could be.
When Peters rose to move a vote of thanks unto
the chair,
He said, “ I’d like to make this one remark—
The arguments of friend McTavish lead me to
declare
That I’ve always been a-gropin’ in the dark.
I’ve been like one benighted, and I’m certain
as can be
That I’ve always been mistaken heretofore ;
From to-night I’ll stick to w T ater, varied now and
then with tea,
And I’ll never touch the whisky any more.”
Then McTavish rose to second it, and briefly he
announced,
“ Mr. Peters has converted me outright;
And, although my love for water has been ardent
and pronounced,
I will never touch cold water from to-night.
I feel to Mr. William Peters gratitude intense,
Words fail me to express the thoughts I think,
But I can’t resist his eloquence, his wit, and
common sense —
In short, my brethren, comanavadrink.”
McTavish now sings roaring songs in praise of
rosy wine,
And fills himself with whisky from the still;
While Peters preaches temperance and abstinence
divine,
And sings of sparkling water from the rill.
Now, the stranger entering Brogan’s Flat, and
coming from the west,
Never hears the sounds of revelry and mirth ;
And the stranger from the eastward never marks
the place as blest,
For he thinks he’s struck the drunkest spot on
earth.

The Snake.
POLITICAL POINTS
MOTHER was making cakes. She
prided herself on her cakes, and Ted and
I encouraged her.
This morning she had insisted upon having a
big pile of wood built up in a corner of the kitchen,
which was large and roomy, though Ted had
strongly advised her against it, saying that he had
heard of lots of snakes having been caught in
town.
But she was obstinate, and had her way.
And now she was busy baking. Ted was
digging a gutter near the back door, “in case it
might rain any time within the next six months,”
he said, stopping now and again to rest on his
spade and address me where I sat in the shade
near him, sewing. Then we were suddenly and
rudely interrupted.
Poor old mother, in turning to place a shovel-
ful of red-hot coals under the colonial oven, had
seen, coiled up in the middle of the brick floor, and
between her and the closed door, a long reddish-
brown snake ; and then she had impulsively placed
the shovelful of glowing coals right in the centre
of the coils.
For a moment nothing happened,, and then the
snake broke into an ecstasy of calisthenics. He
was drunk with excitement and hot coal. Up
and down! up and down! between ceiling and
floor, like lightning went that snake. Mother
screamed and sprang on to the table behind her.
The snake landed beside her—whipping, whirling,
twisting. Mother shrieked and made a terrific
spring for the dresser, emitting a series of terrified
yells as she leaped backwards and forwards, for
the reptile was going strong, always appearing to
be in mid-air.
It was at this stage that Ted reached the door,
spade in hand, and opened it, only to close it
again promptly for a moment.
“ What’s the matter ?” I cried, breathless.
“ Matter ! matter ! ” he gasped ; “ the kitchen’s
full o’ dam whip snakes ! ” and then he rushed
in.
I stood at the door crying helplessly, and wring-
ing my hands, and listening to mother, who had
stopped screaming, and was repeating aloud, with
great fervor, something that sounded like the
litany for the dead.
Ted was making hits, mostly futile, at the flying
snake, but at last he managed to cut it in
two on the window-sill, and half of it dashed at
the wood heap, while the other half danced in
mid-air. I ran in. “Oh, mother! mother! are
you hurt! ” I said.
“She’s bit all over,” Ted moaned, with the
certainty of despair, smashing the snake’s head
viciously with the spade.
But she was not bitten at all, only terribly
frightened; and after what Ted called a good
stiff “pull” at his flask (he was a handyman to
have about the house in ease of emergency) she
recovered sufficiently to be able to tell us all about
it.
“When I sprang from the corner of the table
to this spot ”
“Y’ never jumped from that corner to here /”
ejaculated Ted, interrupting.
“I did, indeed,” she assured him.
“ Fetch the tape measure,” Ted cried, excitedly.
“It’s eight-foot-six if it’s an inch; an’ fer a
woman o’ fifty, an’ in skirts, it’s a world’s record ! ”
He eyed her doubtfully.
“I s’pose y’ couldn’t do it again, ’ithout th’
snake, an’ for a wager ? ” he said, regretfully.
She replied indignantly that indeed she could
not ! And I giggled. And then mother said
that she had always lived honestly, and tried to
do her duty, and she didn’t know why she had
been afflicted with children who were idiots.

POLITICAL POINTS
MICKO (he might have been Johno—
but Johnos usually wear wide-brimmed
straw hats and smoke cigarettes by in-
stalments ; my friend wore a “ monty ” and
smoked to a finish) sat beside me on the rear of
the tram and opened the conversation. “Them
coves is the greatest pirates on the road.”
I looked up in time to get the full force of his
exhalation of cigarette smoke. I cleared the
atmosphere with a few waves of my newspaper
and fixed him with an inquiring gaze. Micko
repeated the observation. Three girls, and the
driver of the tram immediately behind ours, were
laughing and chatting together.
“ Uniform ?” I suggested.
“No, it ain’t altogether the uniform that does
it; but, yer see, girls ’as a better chance o’ gettin’
on a conversation with them tram-drivers than
with or’n’ary blokes like you ’n’ me. Oh, I tell
yer they’re somefin’ orful; I nearly lorst the best
little girl I ever ’ad over one o’ them pirates. We
wuz goin’ to a picnic down the ’arbor, an’ sat on
the front o’ the tram. After a minute or two my
little lot starts cliippin’ to the driver, ’n’ ’im to
’er —never noticin' Pilgarlic ’ere. Well, just as
they wuz gettin’ dead sweet an’ arrangin’ for a
meet, ’e runs ’is date-box over a dawg, ’n’ in the
confusion I ’ops me clinah off, ’n’ we finishes the
journey to the Quay on foot. My oath ! A Act
oughter be passed to stop girls from ridin’ on the
front of trams.
“ Never ’ave a girl wot lives in a suburb where
the tram runs ter,” continued Micko. “Now I
know that girl wots doin’ a tale to that driver, ’n’
I know she spends more in traveilin’ on trams than
she does in clothes, ’n’ that’s sayin’ a ’ell ov a lot.
But ’e’s on’y foolin’ ’er. You see ’im when ’e gets
out ter the suburb where ’e’s goin’ ter. Ye’ll see
a publican’s daughter standin’ at ther door waitin’
ter see ’im pass. On towards the Quay y’ll see ’im
tip ’is cardboard to two dressmakers wot ’ll be
’angin’ outer a winder, also waitin’ t’ see ’im pass.
Blessed if I know.”
Micko shook his head ruefully, and was silent.
After a while: “I reckon we’ll soon be a nation
o’ tram guards ” —this with some conviction. “ I
suppose ye’ve read in them novelettes where the
rich girl clears out with ’er old man’s coachman ?
Well, they don’t do that ’ere, coz there ain’t many
coachies—but there’s tram guards.” And Micko
rattled the laugh of a man with a chest complaint.
“ I knew of a girl—’er old man ’ad stuff—wot
cleared out with a tram driver.”
“And they were married, and are now living
happily ? ”
Micko sneered at my innocerlce. “ Nao ! She’s
workin’ in a laundry now—’n’ Vs in gaol.”
I asked him if it occurred to him that he was
slandering a respectable body of men. “ What! ”
he shouted. “ I suppose you're one o’ the cows,
off dooty.” I told him I was merely the solicitor
for the Train Employees’ Union (or something
equally untrue) and he replied that he didn’t care
if I was dead.
Then he rose, looked down on me contemptu-
ously, and moved towards the side of the car.
Shortly afterwards there was a prolonged grating
sound, a yelling and shouting, a clanging of bells.
Micko dropped lightly off the tram and stood
gazing bade at the rapidly increasing crowd. The
tram following mine had struck a loaded meat
waggon and the roadway looked like a dynamited
abattoirs. As my car moved off again Micko
waved his hat triumphantly to me, and jeeringly
pointed to the pale and trembling driver, who was
doing his best to explain to a policeman that it
wasn’t his fault.

INFLUENZA, that dreaded complaint which is at present so prevalent throughout
Australasia, always has a tendency to leave behind it worse evils than embodied in
itself. In many cases the whole system becomes disorganised. The liver, kidneys,
and digestive organs fail to perform their allotted functions in . a natural manner,
and the human mechanism is thrown completely out of gear. To remedy this and restore
tone to the system, there is no preparation
so effective as Bile Beans, as witness the
following case: —Mr. A. J. Breach, a
commercial traveller, of Dunedin, N.Z.,
says:—“lt is with pleasure that I add
my testimony to the many that have pre-
ceded it to the effective and curative
properties of Bile Beans. I bear witness
that, among the many pills and other
mixtures which are manufactured for the
ills of mankind, your Beans stand out
prominently as the most effective and re-
liable. I may state that after many years
of close confinement at office work, and
having had several attacks of Influenza, my
health ran down to such an extent that my
work was often performed with difficulty.
Hardly a week passed but my head ached,
and my digestion was much impaired.
After trying many professed remedies, my attention was directed to the many testi-
monials in praise of Bile Beans. After taking about half a box, I felt a vast improve-
ment. The digestive organs were put in good trim, and a splendid appetite revived.
The after effects of Influenza have entirely left me. lam confident if an occasional dose
of Bile Beans is taken, it will be the means of warding off such ailments. I always keep
a supply by me, and recommend them to all.”

THE sun’s behind the mountain, ’tween two
trees,
Which, joining arms, lean inwards where
the pass is,
And over-arch the gateway. Lo ! the breeze
Bears gently through, a bright’ning cloud whose
brass is
Transmuted to red gold, ’mid crimson lees
Of sunset-wine, that sinks in gorgeous masses
Behind the chasm ; beyond those sombre ranges
Merged in the after-glow of serial changes.
Against this patch of glory slowly fading,
A dark’ning speck, a blur —I know not what,
That seems to grow, advancing and invading.
The mists of eventide that shroud the spot
As all the changeful colors in their shading
Turn fainter, paler . . . dreamier is the blot.
Yet still ’tis there, as you’ll best understand
Who’ve sought a phantom-sail or “No Man’s
Land.”
You who have sickened in the shimmering heat,
Mid-ocean in some lost and leaky boat,
No sail in sight, no humans left to eat.
And you alone, of all the world, afloat;
Your shadeless canvas still; all slack the sheet,
With not a mark upon the void to note,
Till Fancy, flying to the soul’s relief,
Points to some spectral note and chases Grief.
A sail! A sail! You hug Hope closer yet.
'Tis distant. . . What of that ? You know ’tis
there.
In yon horizon’s ring your gem is set;
Long leagues beyond your reach, howe’er you
dare.
Yet still you hope. She smiles; you cease to fret
Till Night shrouds Man and Ocean in despair,
And the pale stars all mock your silent sorrow.
No lantern cheers your night, no sail your morrow.
And you, lost wanderer in those far-bush mazes,
Where every tree and track shows out the same,
A brazen sky o’erhead; a glare that dazes;
Where fallen timber’s strown all smirched with
flame
And weird, impenetrably-tangled spaces
With vines at Death-grips in a Dantesque dream, —
Yet still you hope, as ’tween the twisted branches
The setting sun his fire-shafts towards you
launches.
“Dear Life’s” you’re one concern on land, on
ocean,
Though there be kindred lives that centre there.
’Tis selfish mostly, yet the strained emotion
Which racks your Soul, let other lips declare,
Although you’ve got a hazy sort of notion
That were you lost, some lives, indeed, were bare.
Ah yes ! one never knows until ’tis tested,
The fulcrum firm wherein Hope’s lever rested.
You, who have watched and waited, sister mine,
The coming of a lover, husband, son,
With all the love affection makes divine—
Love that on earth but barely is begun ;
Yet glad as sunbeams, strong as Chian wine,
More excellent than gold, where fairly won;
You know the tricks an o’er-wrought fancy plays,
Which leads one roundabout, not out the maze.
Where trees are beasts Hyrcanian; columned rocks
Take shapes of man; and, fleeting clouds out-
sailing
On airs of saffron borne, are sheep in flocks
That Jason might have shorn, ere daylight failing
Turns gold to grey, and frenzied fancy mocks
With sprawl of dragons on a field that’s paling;
* Or glimpse of ghostly navies, that before
, Ploughed seas of sapphire toward an unknown
shore.
; Shore that one knows so well, yet never reaches,
With terraced heights and labyrinths and domes,
"Long promontories, lakes, and golden beaches,
< O’er which a flood of molten topaz foams,
Whose dreamy loveliness too sweet for speech is.
In ever-changing beauty as one roams,
Too oft, alas ! the back-ground that our sorrows
Relieve against in form that glory borrows.
: Some shape illusive, there, against the gold,
: Stands out, arresting sight and other senses,
.And, ah 1 how longs the gazer to enfold
The form as yet past all those trees and fences.
The joy once more that faithful heart to fold
Close o’er its throbbing mate, Love’s recom-
pense is—
A dream-act Love’s much given to rehearsing,
TTill frowning Fate stalks in, the plan reversing.

Down the Range.
POLITICAL POINTS
THE “bike” was a German one, and
thoroughly brittle and unreliable. The
chain had snapped twice when climbing
!the long hill, and the truth of what old Billson,
my trainer, had said, was revealed to me. Said
Billson: “ Climb the Horse Range, an’ if ther’s
anything wrang wi’ yer heart or yer machine,
’t’ner Range ’ll find it out! ” The heart seemed
all right, but by the time I reached the top of the
Range my temper was broken right up and the
machine revealed as a fraud and a delusion. I
got off half-way through the defile, and after drink-
ing the little rock fountain dry, sat for a while to
get breath and objurgate the man who first
imported made-in-Germany bicycles. Then I
once more mounted and started down the hill.
It was a wild night. Great masses of scurrying
clouds made fitful darkness, and a nor’wester
howled between the rocks and sighed through the
long golden tussock grass on the hillside. The
Range had a bad reputation; the last day the
coach had run, loaded with notables, to see the
opening of the railway, the brake had given way
about half-way down, just where the sharp right-
angle turn is, and eight horses and 23 human
beings had gone over the precipice. There had
been other minor accidents, involving only two or
three broken limbs at a time, and, consequently,
not considered of much importance. But I
thought of them all, as, with my feet on the front
rests to keep the fore-wheel steady, I came down
the mountain side, with the wind bowling behind
and the moon making fitful light that blurred that
from the lamp.
Suddenly, the machine sprang downwards like
a stone from a sling, and the pressure on the
brake-lever ceased. With a chill feeling down
the spine I clawed for the whirling pedals with
my feet, for the brake had given way at the most
critical part of the descent.
At last I caught one and back-pedalled vigor-
ously, and breathed a sigh of relief as the machine,
for the fraction of a second, slackened speed.
Then—“twang, ping, clang’’—and I heard the
broken chain coil up round the back stanchion as
the machine threw itself promiscuously forward
towards the Coachman’s Leap.
There is nothing in this world gives such a vivid
impression of irresponsible force as a runaway bike
with a broken chain and a powerless brake. The
moon rode out through an archipelago of opalescent
clouds, and her light streamed down on the
waving tussocks on the hillside, the dark, yawn-
ing chasm on the right, the yellow road in
front, and a figure that waddled uncertainly from
left to right, picking his way among the stones
and ruts. For the moment the thought of the
Coachman’s Leap was pushed out of my mind by
this more imminent danger. The track was a
narrow one, and the figure moved from side to
side in an erratic way that made a collision almost
certain. I rang my bell, shouted and howled at
him, and next instant he was right in front of me.
I swung to pass between him and the cliff, but
the left handle hit him in the side. As he shot
behind me I recovered my balance and clung
frantically to the machine, which was now going
furiously down a road as straight as a billiard cue.
Streaming moonlight all around me, howling
wind behind me, and beneath a machine that stag-
gered and trembled with its own incredible speed.
Somewhere thereabouts was the chance of a
plunge of 300 feet, smash, on to black basaltic rock,
but the exultation of wild, bird-like flight robbed it
of all its terrors. The wind cut the eyes like a
knife, breathing was difficult, and the moonlight
went streaming past in a golden flood.
* * * *
I found myself on a level road. The speed had
slackened and the landscape had broken through
the moonlight that had ceased to stream, and I
fell splash into a little pool of water that filled a
depression.
I gathered my mislaid identity after a while.
My head was sore and my limbs were shaking,
and I felt a weak, fluttery feeling half way down
my chest that made it hard to breathe. I remem-
bered what had happened, and looked up the ex-
panse of waving tussocks shimmering goldenly in
the soft Maoriland moonlight. Somewhere up
that hill the traveller was lying injured or
dead, and I set my teeth and dragged my
self up to look for him. It took me an hour to
reach the spot where the figure had been struck.
I recognised it by the narrowness of the road, due
to the falling away of the hillside. But there was
no sign of the traveller. I shouted and cooeed, but
the only answer was the roar of the wind through
the rocky defile above, and the sigh and whisper
of the tussocks. Then I knew I had hurled him
over the precipice. I got down on my hands and
knees, and foolishly tried to peep into the black-
ness below. I saw where the steel rim had
scratched the hard clay, just one irieh from the
edge. Then I choked. For my handle, striking
the poor traveller, had swung me round the sharp,
almost right-angled turn of the Coachman’s Leap.
If it had not struck him I would never have turned
that corner.
I walked down the hill to where I had left the
machine, fixed the chain with my last splicing
link, and rode the crippled implement into the
township. Arrived there I told the police sergeant
what had happened, and went on to the hotel to
stay myself with stimulants.
They were playing cards, and remarked that
they did not envy the sergeant his search up the
range. In between whiles they tried to cheer me
by pointing out that I was in no way responsible
for the accident, and flippantly observing that if a
man hadn’t the decency to get out of the way of
another man on a runaway bicycle, what happened
served him right.
Just as I was beginning to see it the parlor door
opened feebly, and a white-faced rustic entered.
He dropped on the sofa with a heavy groan and
gasped for whisky. The landlord ran for the
bottle, and, when the white-faced man had taken
a long drink, someone remarked: “ You look as
though you’d seen a ghost, Sandy !”
Said the rustic scornfully: “Mon, I’m aston-
ished at ye. D’ye think a mere ghost wad upset
a mon tae this extant.” (Raising his voice) “I
ha’ seen auld Horney himsel’ this verra nicht.
An’ more, I hae such a flick in the side frae his
tail that I’ll hae the mark thereof till I dee.”
Mr. Crump, the town clerk, looked up, placed
his English terrier on the table, adjusted his
glasses, shifted his pipe to the other side of his
face, and spoke severely :
“ Do you seriously mean to asseverate, Mr.
Macpherson, that you have seen a demon to-
night ? ”
“I doo,” said Macpherson, otherwise known
as Sandy ; “an’ I tell ye I hae such a flick frae
his tail in ma side that tuk the breath clean out o’
me.”
“Describe the apparition,” said Mr. Crump,
loftily.
“I was cornin’ doon the Horse Range, and ma
horse bolted when I got off at the top tae hae
a drink frae the little fountain, and I was footin’
it hame. Ye ken that place whaur the coach
lep-ped ower is haunted. Sure enough, just when
I gets there, I hears the most awfu’ howlin’ and
shriekin’ that ever mortal ears heard. While I
was wonderin’ what tae dae, he shot pass me wi’
an awfu’ screech, an’, as he went, he flicked me
wi’ his tail and sent me bang against the cliff. I
climbed oop tha side, and came doon by a goat-
track ; but when I look-ed oop he was just disap-
pearing doon the road.”
“ Disappearing down the road ! And what was
his appearance—how did he look?” asked Mr.
Crump.
Macpherson drank some more whisky, and
cleared his throat. “He was like a mon frae the
top o’ his head tae tha tail o’ his coat, but he’d
neither arms nor legs—just a heed an’ a body, an’
he was sliding doon a moonbeam in a most ter-
reefic manner, without effort—just sliding doon
it as a callant might slide doon a stair banister,
but at a terreefic speed. Mon, it was an awesome
sight.”
“ But his countenance —his face; what was his
face like ? ” asked Mr. Crump eagerly.
“It was an awfu’face —a wicked face, and his
eyes were like twa red lamps, an’ he smelt some-
thin’ awfu’ o’ sulphur.”
“ Had he any horns ?” asked Crump, cheerfully.
“He had twa. He was an awfu’ villain tae look
at an’ he was screamin’ like a thousan’ lost souls.”
I couldn’t stand the description any longer, so
I put my hat on top of the alleged horns and left.
The sergeant returned at 4 a.m., cold, worn-out,
bruised, and angry. The things he said about me
couldn’t have been more disrespectful if my head
had been decked with sixteen horns.

up. I took some of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla and it soon put me to rights,
and my strength returned. I can
safely recommend it to others. I
also in this country had, while in
the bush, an attack of scurvy, and
I soon got rid of this complaint
through using the same remedy.
For cleansing the blood, and for
eruptions of the skin, I do not think
it can be beat. Allbuskmenuseit.”
Of course you know very well that the way to cure a disease is first to
remove the cause. Hence, you say, there is no sense in using ointments and
washes for rashes and eruptions. Neither is there any sense in taking
stimulants for weak nerves. First of all, go down deep to the cause of all
the trouble. You will find it in the blood. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla takes out
all the impurities from the blood and makes it rich and red. Then good
health returns.
No other Sarsaparilla is like “Ayer’s ” Sarsaparilla. Do not forget that.
Look out for imitations. They are everywhere. Carefully avoid them.
AYER’S I arsaparilla
Purifies, Enriches, Strengthens, ..Builds Up.
Take Ayer’s Pills with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. One aids the other.

Pills
: • /// -
Are the Best and Safest Family Medicine
--.•‘•■. . # • • . •
Everyone knows for a fact that BEECHAM’S PILLS have stood
the searching test of over fifty years’ continuously advancing popularity,
until to-day the demand for this specific in all parts of the world is
greater than ever. With a certainty the universal verdict of common
sense everywhere justifies the claim. And then, again, BEECHAM’S
PILLS do not require the publication of testimonials to maintain their
tremendous demand.
WHY?
Because those who once try BEECHAITS
PILLS are naturally impelled to inform
others of the benefits to be derived there-
from. This is, perhaps a slow, but it is certainly an honest and
a powerful process, and in this way the confidence and esteem
of the public have been lastingly secured.
No other Medicine in the World can
claim so many Regular Users.
Thousands of families always keep a box of BEECH AM’S PILLS in
the house, so that on the first sign of any irregularity of the system a
timely dose may be administered and further trouble and suffering averted.
Nine-tenths of the BEECHAM’S PILLS sold are purchased by those who
have used them before, and have found them indispensable as
