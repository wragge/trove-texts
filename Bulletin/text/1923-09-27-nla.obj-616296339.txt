AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act,
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

Slang
A recent Bulletin discussion as to the
philological and etymological significances of
the word “Pommy” introduced some of us to
rhyming-slang, whose only merit is its amaz-
ing and outrageous incongruities. We smile
on hearing an expert tell of “an old pot”
“platting his frame on the goose-and-gander”
and “screwing first at the frog-and-toad, and
then through the red-hot cinder.” But
“goose-and-gander” for “verandah,” and
“red-hot cinder” —usually curtailed to “red-
hot”—for “window” indicate a horribly atro-
phied ear, notwithstanding one contributor’s
belief that slangsters wouldn’t use “such halt-
ing and impossible rhymes as ‘immigrant’
and ‘pomegranate.’ ” Old “pot,” for old'
man, is common enough, “pot-and-pan” being
the rhyme. Having a “screw” at a thing,
i.e., a “look,” may possibly be a rhyme to
“view.” I have heard a Cockney waiter use
“strike-me-dead” for “bread,” and, oddly
enough, “Jennie Lee” (the actress) for
“tea,” as well as “stop thief” for “beef,”
“Cain-and-Abel” for “table,” “mother-and-
daughter” for “water,” and other atrocious
verbal contortions. He spoke of “paying his
duchess,” i.e., “rent,” an abbreviation ot
“Duchess of Kent,” and described a customer
as having a “clean misbehave, and his Bar-
ney parted in the hi-diddle-diddle.” “Bar-
ney,” for “hair,” is a corruption of “Barnet
Fair,” quite as intensely Cockney as “Chalk
Farm” for “arm.” In the Bulletin discus-
sion beforementioned, a Cockney classic,
written by George Augustus Sala, was
alluded to. It ran :
I was sitting alone by the Anna Maria,
A-wanning my plates o’ meat,
■ When I hears such a noise on the apples and pears
As made my old raspberry beat.
“Raspberry” here is short for “raspberry-
tart.” And that, of course, is the rhyme-
slang for “heart.”
It has been suggested that rhyming-slang
was originally thieves’ patter, designed for
service as a secret code. But except in
the case of some contractions —which, no
doubt, came later —its meanings are always
too obvious for secrecy. A “crook” of the
“underworld” —so dear to the moving-pic-
ture publicity-man—may *say, “I opened the
early-and-late, went through the eighteen-
pence, opened the Itory-o’-More, ducked into
the shovel-and-broom, and bunged right into
the John Hop’s false alarms,” but he doesn’t
'use these linguistic acrobatics to obscure his
meaning to the uninitiated ; he just does it
to be “flash.” “John Hop,” of course, is
rhyming-slang for “cop”—a “copper” (from
capio; i.e., one who seizes). Actors some-
times use rhyming-slang, and refer to the
stage as the “green,” i.e., “green-gage.” Un-
doubtedly this has been borrowed from the
itinerant side-showman and the busker, who
use rhyming-slang very extensively. Per-
haps “togs” for “clothes” came from the
theatre; lago speaks of “the toged consuls.’'
The real, dyed-in-the-wool thieves’ Latin,
used as a secret code of communication unin-
telligible to the greenhorn, is baclc-slang. In
this argot, ordinary words are inverted like
the “Ruo Emoh” beloved of suburbia. Thus
“police,” backwards, becomes “slop,” a fami-
liar Cockney term. “Boj’” becomes “yob”
(Sydney heard that word often during the
visit of the Milwaukee), “cow” becomes
“woe” and so on. “E-pip” for pipe is in
common use. Harcourt Beatty, the actor,
told me that he was once sharply questioned
by an inquisitive London detective in the
Strand because he had asked a friend to
“sore the daor” — i.e., “cross the road. “Lag”
may be derived from “gaol” in this topsy-
turvy way, and I think “nark” may have
come-from “crank.” Crooks have a language
all their own. “Dancers”—stairs ; “fawney 1
(which has a Romany tang)—ring; “prop”
—breastpin ; “stir” —gaol; “pannum” ( ?
panem. Latin) —bread; “flounder”—cab';
“stook”—handkerchief. To “bridge” a thing
is to expose or exhibit it, qs “bridging a
broad,” when the three-card manipulator
‘Accidentally” shows his victim the little
queen. A “red-lot” is a gold watch; a
“tliimble-and-slang” a watch and chain. To
“give the office,” I am assured by an intelli-
gent magsman of my acquaintance, is derived
from the old-time thieves’ warning, “Ware,
house !” “warehouse” suggesting “office.” To
be “sloughed” is to be locked up. To “flimp”'
a man is to garrotte him, but to “deal” with
him is to violently assault him. In the dock
at the Sydney Central Police Court, Kelly
the Mug heard the magistrate say, “I’ll deal
with this prisoner now,” and at once Kelly
became indignant. “You deal with me!” he
“Why, you couldn’t stoush yer old
cheese !” “Cheese-and-kisses” being “missis.”
The S. M. Herald, in a recent leader, re-
ferred to Professor Mackail’s good word for
slang as a verbal stimulant, and characteris-
tically went on to say:—
It must, unfortunately, be admitted that the
greater portion of our Australian slang now current
appears to be of the baser kind the torturing
of one poor word a thousand ways, such as
“bonzer,” with its_ hideous amendments and addi-
tions ; or the stealing of the scraps, from the great
feast of languages, such as “dinkum.”
The Herald vastly prefers the American
coinage:—
Perhaps America, of all the peoples of our
tongue, has provided the best and most useful
‘slanguage” of the century—such sublime examples
as ‘rubber-necks” and “also-rans,” and “sob-stuff”
and “glad-hand.”
So we must continue to import sublime ban-
alities like “suckers,” “rubes,” “hooch” and
“punk” from the land which has “E pluribus
Barnum” as its motto. The Herald now
prints “dope” without inverted commas ; but
good old “dinkum” and “cobber” must still
be earmarked to indicate their native base-
ness.
NORMAN CAMPBELL.
“Mist on the Cotswold Hills”
Away in the West of England the grey
masses of what John Masefield calls the
“cold Cotswolds” look across the tranquil
Vale of Gloucester towards the faint blue
hills of Wales, home of dreams and mystery.
Between them silver Severn winds through
green pastures towards the sea, and a carveii
tower looms above an old cathedral city.
Shakspeare knew the Cotswolds —“these
high, wild hills” —and quite recently the Bel-
gian poet Cammaerts, looking through the
larch-woods lightly tufted with green on a
sweet May morning, has sung them, too.
And twice, at least, they figure in our own
southern verse.
Amongst the vast spaces of the bush, and
under its cloudless skies, Adam Lindsay Gor-
don’s mind harked back to other days, when
fog clung about the uplands of the Cots-
wolds —days when black Tom Oliver, the
trainer from Prestbury, rode to hounds round
by Cobberley where Thames is born :
I remember the lowering wintry morn,
And the mist on the Cotswold Hills,
Where I once heard the sound of the huntsman’s horn,
Not far from the Seven rills.
But it was not of horses and hunting that
Thomas Bracken thought when he wrote
“Sturt’s Last Letter” :
Sad night was creeping o’er the Cotswold Hills,
Across the footsteps of an April eve,
\.. forest birds had ceased their merry trills
, jid from the land the sun had ta’en his leave.
The very year that Gordon was leaving Eng-
land behind him, with his face turned to-
wards the island-continent terra incognita,
Charles Sturt, the Australian explorer, no
longer young and already broken, was com-
ing back to settle in the Cheltenham Gordon
would never see again. lie had arrived in
Sydney in 1827, and during a quarter of a
century had done much valuable exploratory
work in circumstances of the utmost diffi-
culty, published accounts of his expeditions
and discoveries admirably illustrated by him-
self, and filled various administrative posts,
from Surveyor-General to Colonial Secretary.
But in spite of all he had done for England,
England gave him but little reward, and the
end of his life was saddened by disappoint-
ment and anxiety as to the future of those
he loved. His last letter to George Grey
is preserved in the Auckland Public Library
in Maoriland: it is a most pathetic docu-
ment, and all the more so because of its sim-
plicity. Small wonder that Bracken was
moved to write, with more justice, • perhaps,
than melody:—
Do heroes always wear the crowns they’ve won?
Do honors always wait the pioneers
Who brave the Arctic seas and tropic sun
To carve out greatness for the future years?
Sturt’s letter was written on April 20, 1869,
from Clarence-square, Cheltenham :
I have been very ill ever since the receipt of yout
kind letter, or you should have had an earlier
■ acknowledgment of it from me. Indeed, I have
vexed myself about the delay and at my inability
to write to you sooner.... I have not taken any
further steps with regard to the Order, in which, as
I think I told you in my last letter, I reluctantly
moved. But my friends suggest that it might be
prejudicial to me if I were left out of the list,
and that I owed it to my family to put in a
claim. I am, however, so used to disappointment, if
I may apply that word to the case, that I hardly
expect success in anything. If it has not pleased
Providence to prosper me in a worldly point of view,
1 have much for which to be thankful, but I have
lost heart in my old age and do not like to try
again lest I should draw a blank....it may be that
greater sympathy may be shown (?) for those I
may leave behind me, and on that I have built my
hope.
Thomas Bracken describes the old explorer
sitting in that home in Cheltenham, not
far from the parish church of St. Mary, and
the great college where Gordon was once
a pupil. But the dying man did not see the
primroses in the meadows illumined by the
last rays of the sun, nor the encircling hills
under the peaceful English sky. For he was
far away in spirit, toiling again through
the spinifex, over the burning sand, or
through the trackless bush under the South-
ern Cross.
Again beneath the yellow blaze
Of Austral’s summer sun we march’d,
Across the plains where Darling strays
Through wildernesses pale and parch’d.
Once more on Murrumbidgee’s flood
We swept along, my mates and 1....
He died before he received the Knight Com-
mandersliip of St. Michael and St. George—
the Order referred to in his letter. But
through the exertions of George Grey and
others, a pension was secured for his widow
—the munificent sum of £BO a year—in
memory of the man who had done and en-
dured so much! And that although Henry
Kingsley’s masterly account of Sturt’s expedi-
tion (Kingsley had come to Australia in the
same year as Gordon) had made known
to the world his achievements and his suf-
ferings. But now, at any rate, the old ex-
plorer was beyond the reach of disappoint
ment and injustice. A deeper mist than
that which hangs about the Cotswolds on
lowering wintry mofns had dimmed his eyes
for ever, and in his ears the bells of sweet St.
Mary’s chimed no more.
DORA WILCOX.
Marcel Proust
In an age when psychology is permeating
both art and literature, there should be small
wonder that Marcel Proust is coming into
his own. “A la Recherche du temps perdu”
and “Le Temps retrouve” cast upon the modes,
manners and morals of society the strongest
searchlight that France has seen since the
generation of Jean Jacques Rousseau. For
many years the victim of a gnawing illness,
Proust, like the Shelley of Francis Thomp-
son, fled '“into the tower of his own soul and
raised the drawbridge.” In meticulous de-
tail he there proceeded to recall his mem-
ories of days that had passed. He died in
November last, aged only 49.
What appeal he will have to English read-
ers remains to be seen. In the present state
of our Customs laws, it is safe to assume
that his “Sodome et Gomorrhe” will not see
the inside of the libraries, although all this
fictionary treatise contains is the viewpoint
of an artist on an aberration that has been
allied with art since the beginnings of time.
“A rOmbre des jeunes filles en fleurs” gained
for him the Goncourt Prize—not without pro-
test, however, since in 1919, when it was
awarded, his admirers were outnumbered by
his revilers. ,He does not seek to conceal his
worship, as a member of the upper middle-
classes, for the princes and pretty ladies and
their singularly exciting world ; nor can he

do otherwise than show- youthful exhilaration
at the realisation of his ambition to mingle
with aristocrats of noble lineage, mentally
no Ihi ted vain and lustful though many of
them mav be? In this book the hero grow-
£g into' manhood, discovers how illusmn
follows the imagined attainment of an idea.,
and'repeats with Gilberte, the daughter of
Swann, P and with Albertine (who was desn-
able «o long as her mystery remained) the
very mistake of believing, as did Swann in
his relations with Odette de Crecy, that
mutual love can achieve any definite degiet
of perfection. There is more than a trace
of Stendhal in the way m which, when on
the verge of cutting adrift, for good and ad,
from his liaison with Albertine, he comes
suddenly to wonder whether she really is
faithful to him, and in consequence is
stricken with the grand passion more hope-
lessly than ever. ...
The earliest section of. this huge imagi-
nary autobiography is entitled “Du Cote de
ehez Swann,” and has been brilliantly trans-
lated into English by C. Iv. Scott Moncrieff.
The narrator is first encountered in tin 1
midst of his family at Combray, a small
town in the south of Normandy. Towards
the end of the first volume Proust leaves
this place, and reveals to us the love-affair
of Swann with Odette, who, even after she
becomes his wife, pursues her intrigues. It
is a story of jealousy and despair, the study
of the struggle of an intellectualist to realise
in his mistress the idol that his heart has
created. We are shown his early acquaint-
ance with her, and his introduction to the
Verdurins, the malicious little coterie where
he is required to become one of the “faith-
ful” in order to keep close to her. As the
months draw out, his constant attentions
weary her. She seeks refuge in trickery
and lies, and reduces him to such a state of
passionate uncertainty that sometimes he
hopes she will meet a painless death in
some accident, and he comes to experience a
cordial sympathy with “that Mahomet 11.
whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who,
on finding that he had fallen madly in love
with one of his wives, stabbed her in order,
as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates,
to recover his spiritual freedom.”
It is recorded that when the editors of La
Nouvelle Revue Fbancaise called on Proust
to ask whether they might publish his
masterpiece (which, in their stupidity, they
had previously rejected) they found in a
murky room one who appeared a wizened old
man, heavily robed and wearing a nightcap,
scribbling away by the light of a single
candle. He had become sick with exhaus-
tion, brought on, no doubt, by the gigantic
task he had undertaken, and beneath his
morbidity there was that strain of neuro-
pathy noticeable in the conduct of Aunt
Leonie. This morbidity is an outstanding-
characteristic of the book, whether the hero
is recording the emotions that are brought
forth in dreams or those that result from
his quarrel with Gilberte in “Le C6td de
Guertnantes” ; but the main feature of his
work is his strange style, with its tenuous
sentences and alembicated paragraphs, and
his power to make the reader share the
inner life of his puppets—-their attractions
and repulsions, and their criticisms of litera-
ture, music and painting that point to the
high sensibility and culture of the author.
This cannot be better illustrated than by
quoting his reference to the Vinteuil sonata
which Swann hears with Odette at the Ver-
durins, and thus associates with her, and
which he again hears (when he fears that
Odette is drifting away from him) at an
evening given at the Marquise de Saint-
Euverte’s: —
He knew that his memory of the piano falsified
still further the perspective in which he saw the
music, that the field open to the musician is not a
miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable
keyboard (still almost all of it unknown), on
which, here and there only, separated by the gross
darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among
the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion,
of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each
differing from all the rest as one universe differs
from another, have been discovered by certain great
artists who do us the service, when they awaken
in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which
they have found, of showing us what richness, what
variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great
unpenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of
our soul, which we have been content to regard as
valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been
one of those musicians.
W. E. LEICESTER.
Melville
Two new standard editions of Herman
Melville are proof of the revival of interest
in this once all but forgotten writer. Con-
sult any literary reference book more than
a dozen years old and see in what a brief
and easy fashion he is dismissed ; then turn
to any of the best English literary magazines
of to-day and notice the seeming extrava-
gance of the language in which he is de-
scribed. But the modern judgment does not
represent finality any more than the verdict
of his contemporaries. “Moby Dick” —a
spiritual romance which is more comparable to
the “Idylls of the King” than to the “Pilgrim’s
Progress”-—is probably on its surface mean-
ing the greatest story of the sea ever written,
though full of lapses and very unequal in
quality. That most modern writers accept
as something of an axiom; but lured into
strange places by the inner meaning of the
tale, the same writers are not quite prepared
to give Melville the credit he deserves for
“Typee,” that strange book of the early Paci-
fic, in which he worried little about good and
evil and a great deal about the customs of
the fascinating natives of the Marquesas
Islands. Melville makes us breathe the air
of that delicious valley in which he was
kept for some future cannibal feast. The
good-natured native men, the beautiful and
dainty native women, the remoteness of all
help, the constant doubt of the motives of
those who held him captive but treated him
so well, the growing horror of the knowledge
that these delightful, easy-going people really
devoured human flesh in their secret and ter-
rible orgies—all these, coupled with the
assertion that the narrative is a relation of
fact, give to the book a charm wholly un-
like that of anything else that has come from
the big ocean at our doors. As in all his
work. Melville is here patchy in style. Some-
times the manner is so delightful and lucid
and satisfying that the reader is entirely
unconscious of it, wholly absorbed, as he
should be, in the matter. At other times
Melville lets us down a little. But one curi-
ous effect is produced —quite intentionally,
I think —in “Typee” which adds greatly to
its fascination. It is the feeling that the
author is keeping something back —not_ tell-
ing you everything he saw. Did he slip m
and see that cannibal feast? Did he shudder
away in loathing from those friendly native
women when he was wholly convinced of the
truth? I think Melville means you to ask
those questions—either that or the narrative
is literally true in every detail, and he is
keeping something back. Just at present
"Moby Dick” holds the stage. Every psy-
chologist and psycho-analyst can get to work
on it and chatter helpless phrases about its
meaning and intention; but the world will
probably come back to Melville in his other
mood and find as much to delight in “Typee”
as it finds to astonish in “Moby Dick.”
The secret of Melville is that he belongs
to New England Puritanism, and saw that
outer world of tropic isle and far-reaching
sea with Puritan eyes. The sight was enough
to awaken in his mind a discussion about
moral right and wrong as keen as the de-
bates of the Westminster Assembly of
Divines, but always with the sensuous back-
ground of the things seen and heard. His
own country had little appreciation of his
quality; his own age had little sympathy
for his giant strivings after unattainable
things; the present age appears to appre-
ciate and sympathise too much. The first
revival of literary interest in him led to a
demand for his books; now it is the right
thing to say fine things about him. He is
the literary fashion, and liable to be deposed
for some other person raised from- the dead.
Still, the whole phenomenon is remarkable
enough. Melville, from a place in public
esteem far lower than that of Fennimore
Cooper, has been raised to an equality with
Hawthorn. He has even been spoken of as
America’s greatest prose-writer. But not by
Americans.
C.O.M.
Our Literary Spirit
A definite and highly creditable attempt
is being made to lLt Australian literature
to a higher plane. Not in literary produc-
tion any more than in our daily round is
the capping, fault-finding spirit the highest
expression of which human beings are cap-
able. It is remarkable, and regrettable, that
in a land of brightness such as ours the ori-
ginal blight cast upon our presentment of
life should have been allowed to remain so
long. It was the work of embittered exiles
who did not understand the spirit of the
place wherein they, for the most part failures
in their native land, found themselves. Only
now that Australia has been through the
crucible of the Great War is she finding true
expression, sloughing the skin of cynicism
that has bound her literature and journalism.
The reason is not far to seek. The bitter
and disappointed ones from overseas have
lost their influence over the young Austra-
lians who have seen the world for them-
selves, and are, therefore, to some degree
capable of appraising their heritage at its
true worth. It is not that Australian char-
acter has changed greatly. It is in most
ways continuing along its former lines of
development, with a fearless out-
look, seasoned with a big, good-natured,
tolerant sort of humor that, for all its good
nature, lacks nothing in pungency, if humor
as apart from wit can be given that adjec-
tive.
That the war should alter our character
in some respects was natural enough, but one
would hardly have expected it to be in the
direction of imparting more generosity and
geniality. The plain truth is that we are
beginning to awaken to what a splendid heri-
tage we really have, what a wonderful oppor-
tunity to stamp our native gold into a guinea
that will carry as currency all the world
over. And, too, the young Australian of to-
day is in many ways a bigger man that the
young Australian of pre-war days. As he
grows he is leaving behind him the small-
minded carping that has too often passed
for smartness. He begins to see that it is good
to appreciate the sunshine, that it is wisdom
to take unto himself the beauty of Nature
and the glory of life, that the biggest things
are done not by narrow-eyed suspicion, but
by open-eyed generosity. He lives in a broad
and generous land. And for the first time
he knows it.
It is this that is beginning to find its way
into our literature and give it a new distinc-
tion. We who with our environment should
be the exponents of all that is big and bright
and generous in literature are beginning to
awaken to that fact. Not only do we possess
one of the happiest countries the world has
ever known; we also inherit the finest litera-
ture. Even those of us who cannot read
Greek have yet been able to assimilate some
of its uplift, its joyousness, its appreciation
of the beauty and joy of life which has per-
meated the great stream poured out in our
own mother-tongue. All that is necessary is
that we should add to this the distinctive
atmosphere of our own free lives, the great
crooning kindness of the Bush Mother who
is our own especial glory, ours by right of
birth and understanding, and who to-day is
beginning to find expression through her own
sons and daughters.
W. M. FLEMING.
“Modern” Art
The advent of the bizarre section of
modern art was contemporaneous with or
followed soon after the introduction of in-
stantaneous photography. Before that time
Landseer and others painted animals in
motion or repose, and their pictures con-
veved to our brains, through our vision, the
state of rest or action intended, so that we
decided at a glance whether a horse was
walking, trotting or galloping, or whether
a man was walking or running. Again, if
we turn a wheel rapidly enough, even if it
has only two spokes, our eyes convey to our
brains a picture of a solid disc, and there-
fore by the pre-modern artist it would be so
drawn. But the camera shows us that these
things are not so; a horse or man or other
object in motion is shown by an instanta-
neous photo to be quite different from the
picture which the eyes convey to the brain ;
and the wheel, if the photograph is instan-
taneous, is, instead of a disc, just a wheel
with two spokes. I am not inferring that
modern art is a reproduction of camera pic-
tures ; but it would appear that a sect.on of
the artists, on proof being given by the
camera that things were not as they seemed
to the normal eye, got an impression that
they were a gifted few who couid see them
as they really were, and have since tried to
paint them accordingly. This is quite right
from their point of view, and perhaps from
the view of a few people who profess to
understand and admire their wora. But it
is quite otherwise from the pomt of view of
the picture-loving public, who only want to
see pictures of scenes and objects painted as
nature has given them eyes to see. If the
public is to continue having public picture
galleries and visiting them, it will always
require the great majority of pictures to be
of things as the eye sees them. A few of the
ultra-moderns may be encouraged as freaks,
by contrast with which the others may be
better appreciated.
WILLIAM CLOWES.
Man and Woman
Mary Scott pleads for more candor: —
Lester Way (R.P. 16/8/’23) has proved himself
so shrewd an analyst in admitting his own conceit
as the reason for his preference for the society of
brainless females (it will be noted that he expresses
no such partiality for the society of men with inferior
mental equipment, which proves his reason to be
but half a reason) that it is a wonder he has not
been able to go a step further and penetrate the
real motive actuating his “Bit of Fluff” as she
gazes on him with large-eyed admiration and mur-
murs her conviction that he is “a man of inexplic-
able profundity.” His conceit must indeed be greater
than his own realisation of it to prevent his grasp-
ing the fact that, the lady has as much interest in
his intellectual attainments as she has in Tutank-
hamen. The brainless woman does not revere intellect
in mankind —why should she?—but she has her ends
to serve, and her vanity is tickled by the ease
with which she lands a very big fish with her very
small net.
But I think the weight of evidence is against the
contention that the marriage of Brains and Feather-
brains is the felicitous marriage, and there are cer-
tainly some notable students of human nature to
bear me out. David Copperfield is known to have
been sadly disappointed with the result when he
had captured and caged his pretty, fluttering Dora.
Lady Esmond, when she fina'ly acknowledged to
herself her own mental superiority to her guzzling
lord, found her girlish adoration turn to bitter con-
tempt. Also, there is a modern gentleman who has
written a waspish poem wherein a disillusioned young
man bewails the fact that the excellent things he
planned have all been made the sport of the woman
who never could know and never could understand.
The fact is that the tragedy of unions founded
on silly pretence and a consuming desire to feed
one’s vanity is only apparent when life begins to
press. Then will Curly Locks take her revenge for
the slaps of Fate by letting her bewildered mate
know the completeness with which she despises
those things which he holds most dear and knows
to be the best part of himself. For a man is never
more certainly posing than when he dubs his passion
for the fruits of the mind a pose, unless indeed he
be but a dilettante and no true student. Then will
she take her little axe in hand and proceed to
chop down the lofty perch which he has fondly
bedeved a pedestal whereon she has placed him for
more convenient worship. Invariably both are hurt
in the crash, and thus are the ends of poetic justice
served.
When will men and women decide to take a chance
on being honest with one another?
"B.C.F.":
I question the soundness of Mr: Furnley Maurice s
melancholy assumption (R.P. 6/9/’23) that “nobody
that’s any good sells’’ —he is speaking of verse. For
example, “Victor Daley does not sell.” Well, my
copy of V.J.D.’s “At Dawn and Dusk” is marked
“Fourth Edition” ; and Farrell’s “How He Died” had
also been four times to press when I got my copy,
seven years ago. “I am not expecting a ‘best-seller
circulation,” remarks Mr. Maurice with becoming
modesty; “I am looking for an intense and limited
pub ic of about 350.” 1 have beside me an old
Sydney catalogue (1915). Two of “Banjo” Paterson’s
best-known books had, according to the publishers
(Angus and Robertson), attained even unto the
58th and 17th thousand respectively. Of Henry
Lawson’s “In the Days When the World Was Wide ’
the presses had turned out 20,000 copies, and “When
I Was King” reached 10,000. I cite these instances
merely in impersonal commentary upon Mr. Maurice’s
pessimism regarding the number and taste of Aus-
tralian verse-readers. Not for the world would X
suggest that his own work or that of his friends
does not rank with that mentioned, and that this
has something to do with his and their failure to
find an appreciative public.
“C.McL.”: “8.C.F.” (R.P. 13/9/’23) calls atten-
tion to Chevreul’s pendulum as proving the truth
of Cou6ism. In reality it only proves that the
“unconscious,” by auto-suggestion, can influence
striped muscle. It does not at all prove that it
can influence non-striped muscle, such as is to
be found in the arteries. Nor does it prove that
it will search out any disease in the body and cure
it. That is the whole question at issue, and until
there is definite and unquestionable scientific proot
it must remain doubtful. At present CouCism is
in almost the same position as Hicksonism, though
certainly there is more to be said for it whatever
way we look at it, and there can be no question
whatever as to Coue’s transparent honesty.
The Hound of the Road, by Mary Gilmore (Angus
and Robertson). This little book of essays is essen-
tially a woman’s book. Woman is an incurable opti-
mist. It is she who, in times of trouble, says
thankfully “Thv will be done” at a moment when .a
man will swear and wonder why ever he was born.
Where the greatest of modern pessimists, Anatole
France, sees in a dog worshipping his master merely
a caricature of man’s attitude to God, Mrs. Gilmore
gentlv speculates on its intelligence and what it
thinks about and how things seem to it, and the
sort of ideas which fill its brain when it dreams, and
how much of its dreams it remembers when it awakes.
These essays are charming, and faithfully represent rhe
mind of a cultured woman of the country who has
thought and read much, and has ae< urately observed
the life, both of men and animals, which goes on far
from cities. She speculates upon the mute, inglori-
ous Miltons that abound, singers and artists who
never bad a chance to show their genius, and if the
essays sometimes verge on the mystical, they are at
all events full of hope and tenderness; and their
literary style is beautiful. “The Hound of the Road”
is not" merely a woman’s book; it is. essentially a
country-woman’s book —a book of the Australian
country and its life.

The Burroughs Duplex
Will Save Time in
Analysing Your Sales
ADDS
SUBTRACTS
MULTIPLIES
DIVIDES
Because the Burroughs Duplex (Two Adding Machines in
One) gives Group Totals and a Grand Total automati-
cally, it saves time and money in obtaining such informa-
tion as sales by clerks, departments, lines or branches and
total sales; expense by departments and total expenses;
costs by jobs and total costs, and in handling other figure
work where individual and grand totals are required.
Note the form reproduced below. As the various
columns were listed and added, the machine printed, but
“remembered” and accumulated the individual totals so
that the grand total shown in the last column was
available immediately.
Thus the Duplex actually accomplishes two jobs at one
time, and offers you the easiest and quickest way for
obtaining the information you need to make more money.
Like all Burroughs machines, the Duplex is built to last a
business life-time by the largest manufacturers of adding,
book-keeping and calculating machines in the world.
Ask us to demonstrate the Burroughs Duplex on your
own work. You will then be able to judge for yourseif
how valuable this double adding machine will be to you;
how it will save you money and give you the information
you need about your business. Such demonstration will
cost you nothing, nor place you under any obligation to buy.

The Road We Take.
The road runs onward, now rough, now-
level —•
So, let us follow it, follow it, Friend;
For we have finished with feast and revel,
And seeking gold ’neath the rainbow’s end.
Old dogs and weary, we know rough going,
And pick the places that suit our feet;
With limbs grown listless and pulses slowing,
’Tis ill to travel too far, too fleet
Lest marsh-fires lure us and marsh-mire
smother,
Or, nowhere leading, new tracks we make ;
There stands a signpost, and there another,
With fingers pointing the road to take.
Put there by dreamers and bygone sages,
They’ve braved, unchanging, through day
and night,
The winds and weather of many ages ;
But —who knows whether they point
aright?
Behind us Life in its prime rejoices,
And Youth makes merry, and wine runs
red
In taverns ringing with jovial voices—
Yet all must follow the road we tread.
Then let us forward, but still remember
The green paths trodden when we were
young—
The lights and splendors of life’s September,
The dreams we dreamt and the songs we
sung.

The Grotto.
My spirit stole within the twilight-dimmed
Green-weeded grot, starred with sea-roses
rare,
Where Echo breaks the silence unaware,
And flower-shaped chalices gleam rainbow-
rimmed.
Slim figures, raven-tressed, were whitely
limned
Against brown rocks, save one, so lily fair,
Whose satin skin, ’neath streaming golden
hair,
Shone azure-veined, with eyes where laughter
brimmed.
A moonstone lay in the fair ivory shrine
Of her small palm. Two feet of perfect
mould
Made dimpled loveliness. My pulses race—
In Some forgotten life had she been mine?
Aeons ago perchance, ere stars grew old.
She turned and smiled! ’Twas Aphrodite’s
face.

Song Before a Journey.
Before I go to London-town,
Where streets are paved with gold,
I’ll buy me little flame-red shoes
To keep my feet from cold,
And skins of little rabbits grey
Will wrap me tenderly,
When I go up to London-town
That holds the heart of me.
Before I go to London-town
To see the Queen and King,
I’ll write a thousand little songs.
And teach the King to sing.
Heigho ! You’ll hear a monarch’s voice
Set to a changeling’s tune,
When I go up to London-town
To see the King in -June.
Before I go to London-town,
Where pavements shine rain-lust*
I’ll set a star behind my ear
To glimmer through the mist;
And I’ll store laughter in my mouth,
xlnd folly in my eyes,
Lest anyone in London-town
Should try to make me wise.
Before I go to London-town,
Where streets with sorrow gleam,
I’ll string the beads of merriment
Upon a thread of dream;
I’ll wind them swift about my throat
And round my leaping feet,
Lest when I go to London-town
Life should not be so sweet.
Before I go to London-town
I’ll steal from Yesterday
Ten thousand hairs' of Beauty’s head,
And everyone will say:
“Why do you smile when all the world
Is drowning deep in tears?”
When I go up to London-town
With plunder from the years.
And when I get to London-town
(Ah, whisper, do not sing!)
I shall be crowned more royally
Than any sceptred king;
The little rainbowed hands of Love

IN THE BIG-SCHEME COUNTRY.
The daily, or at least hebdomadary, appearance
of Home-Minister Pearce in the capacity of
Australia’s prize political begging-letter
writer and political company promoter
grows wearisome. His permanent topic
nowadays is the marvels which ought to be
done, and are to be done, with masses of
British and Commonwealth money, for the
North-West (that is to say, for the north
and centre of his own State) when his chief
reaches London and gets his teeth into the
ear of the British Treasury. The Northern
Territory, which is Federal property, and so
has. first claim on any development that the
Federal Government may have concealed
about it, gets a bare mention at times for
the sake of appearances. But the real text
is that it is the duty of all the States, even
the poorest, to put up their money and
credit for the benefit of Pearce’s Golden
Giant, which is always short of funds
through low taxation. This, for instance, is
the telegraphed summary of the great politi-
cal schnorrer’s recent discourse at Perth:
It is the desire of the Prime Minister, in which
he doubtless has the support of his Ministers, to
give all possible assistance to this State in its great
task of developing the North-West. The greatest
problem is that of communication. Railways, tele-
graphs and harbors are wanted. If the Northern
Territory and North-West were given facilities such
as exist in the Western District of Queensland in
the matter of communication, they would show
similar development We hope, as the result of
the Prime Minister’s visit to England, to get some
Big Scheme moving. It seems to us that the ques-
tion is really one of empire concern. It is too
big for the State, and almost too big for the
Commonwealth.
* * * *
It is the big talk of the company-promoter
—the Hooley or Bottomley or Baron
Grant of real life, and the Merdle or
Davenport Dunn or Montagu Tigg of
fiction. They always aimed to get some Big
Scheme started in a full-grown condition
with Big Finance for its basis; and the
South Sea people, and the Darien colony
promoters, and the Mississippi adventurers
were of the same order. On the other hand,
the Plymouth Rock crowd and most others
which achieved success were content to begin
at the beginning. North Australia has
already had some experience of Big Schemes.
In earlier- days the Territory was discovered
and adopted as a mining proposition by Big
Schemers, mostly in London, a villainous lot
akin to those who, 40 or 50 years earlier,
struck the idea of raising loans for imaginary
republics. It has always been the luck of
Central and North Australia to be governed
by long-distance telegram, with knaves, fools
or perfunctory and uninterested loafers at
the far end of the wire, whether the far
end was London or Perth or Melbourne. The
old mining boom was a case in point. In
the Census report of the Territory a typical
case is quoted: some £BO,OOO was spent on
luxurious quarters for the staff and on the
adjuncts of civilisation generally, and if the
staff hadn’t forgotten to open the mine every-
thing in the garden might have been lovely.
The business of the people at one end being
to sell scrip, and of those at the other end
(largely bright young cadets and social orna-
ments) to enjoy life, the failure, helped on
by lack of means of communication, was
pretty unanimous. Then came the days
when the Territory passed under Federal
control, and a remote absentee Ministry, of
which Senator Pearce was one of the most
brilliant lights, had another Big Scheme. It
appointed superfluous and incompetent
officials just as the previous generation of
Big Schemers appointed ornamental mine-
managers, only more of them, and worse. It
delegated its real authority to , A.W.U.
officials, invited over from their Bolshevik
haunts for the purpose. Then it went home,
and save for telegraphing a new law or two
every week, said law drafted by someone who
never saw the North and possibly never
wanted to, the most promising new land in
a world that is growing crowded and old was
forgotten. As for the North-West, it has
been also blessed with Big Schemes. One
was the meatworks at Wyndham, built out
of big loans regardless of expense, and run
by the union bosses, where meat was frozen
or tinned by telegram from Perth 2177 miles
away. Another was the State steamship
service, which was supposed to keep the
North awake and busy. It made almost as
bad a financial mess as the meatworks, and
at that palatial establishment it cost more
to get a bullock on board than the animal
was worth.
* * * *
The last success achieved hereabouts in
the way of “development” was the founda-
tion of Queensland. That happened G 4 years
ago, and it was done, not, sad to say, by
self-governing Australians, who have made a
failure of “development,” but by British
officialdom. There was no Big Scheme in
the case, nor was there any grandiose
Official Schemer, nor did any mendicant in
spats or otherwise go to London about a
loan. Simply the eastern section of Aus-
tralia was cut up, as the western one (West-
ralia) ought to be, and 25,000 people pro-
ceeded to try their luck as a new State.
They had 74d. in the Treasury, and what
they possessed in the way of public works
may be gathered from the fact that the bill
for improvements sent to the new Govern-
ment by the old crowd at Sydney, and still
unpaid, was £49,855. Had Queensland not
separated it may be inferred that “develop-
ment” would have continued at the same
breathless pace, and the place would be to-
day very much what the Territory and the
North-West still are (that is to say, a “pro-
blem”), and real settlement would be no fur-
ther up the east coast than it is up the west,
and massive political Blunderbores would
be wrestling with Big Schemes for getting
population to settle in Brisbane. Unluckily
no one had the sense to repeat the Brisbane
experiment in the vicinity of Rockhampton
and Townsville or Cairns, so fairly close
settlement only moved as far north as the
pushing influence of Brisbane could send it.
* * * *
The Bruce-Page Ministry is a curious
conglomeration of atoms. The Treasurer is,
and has always been, an advocate of more
States, which is quite in keeping with the
Federal idea, and is expressly provided for
in the Constitution. The Minister of Cus-
toms is a reactionary who wants to go back
to the ways of 100 years ago, when every-
thing, large and small, was mismanaged from
one centre. Having got the nominal
Federal capital fixed at Canberra, in his own
electorate, he apparently thinks it would be
a fitting tribute to his importance if all the
State capitals moved there likewise. Such
a freak is wholly out of place in a Federal
Ministry, yet he is tolerated; and the
Treasurer, who is also leader of the New
State movement, appears on the same plat-
form with him. The Minister for the Terri-
tcries uses his position to hunt for favors for
his own State. The Prime Minister makes
formal acknowledgment that the obligation
to build the railway for which S. Australia
so unwisely paid in advance is a real obliga-
tion. Yet he shirks it, just as did hesitating
Hughes, his wholly unsatisfactory predeces-
sor, and apparently he is away to England to
pawn all the States in a large gay fashion
for the benefit of Westralia and Queensland.
As Minister Pearce indicates, Big Schemes
are in the air, and ever since Australia first
became acquainted with the crowd to which
Pearce belongs Big Schemes have been
disastrous and costly, and the ways of Big
Schemers have given rise to comment. It
would be refreshing to have for a change a
Moderate-sized Scheme which would be a
business-like reality. Such a thing would be
the building of a standard-gauge South-to-
North railway at the rate of 100 or 150
miles per annum out of the baby-bonus
money, which appears to do no perceptible
good where it is, supplemented by such other
trifles as may be necessary. It would take
some time to arrive, but even then it ought
to beat any really Big Scheme by some hun-
dreds of lengths.
THE PRICE OF FREETRADE.
Ellis Island has provoked more hostile criti-
cism of late than any other American institu-
tion barring prohibition; yet it stands for
something of which any patriotic U.S. citizen
has a right to be proud. The republic is in the
happy position of being so attractive to the
world’s emigrants that it has had to devise
a scheme to limit the inflow. It is able to
retain those it breeds, and to pay those who
are prepared to give good service the highest
wages of any country. France is in much
the same position. For five years a manu-
facturers’ policy has been followed there,
with the result that not only is there no
unemployment, but a labor shortage is being
felt. A nation’s tragedy of unemployment
goes deeper than the necessity of keeping
the out-of-work from starvation by public
doles, or than the danger of revolution repre-
sented by the presence of hundreds of thou-
sands of hungry men, women and children.
Unemployment means the exportation of
labor, and that soon comes to mean a loss of
prestige amounting to degradation. In the
great cities of the world it is not necessary
to turn up official reference-books to discover
which nations are failing in the industrial
struggle. The answer can be found in those
streets where ladies of easy virtue parade,
in the restaurants which employ cheap
waiters, in shoe-shine establishments,
gambling houses, low-class night-clubs, and
wherever else the helot trades are plied.
Nothing caused self-respecting Germans more
anguish in the period before Bismarck’s
policy of high Protection had begun to pro-
duce effects than a course of foreign travel
and the resulting discovery that a majority
of the white inmates of Asiatic brothels
were women of their nationality.
There is no need for an Ellis Island in
Freetrade England: what it requires is an
Australia House-—not a receiving and sort-
ing station, but a sink down which unem-
ployables may be dropped to the antipodes
wholesale. According to a cable of last
week:—
A deputation from the Bradford and District Manu-
facturers’ Federation waited on the Board of Trade
in order to emphasise the serious condition of the
wool textile industry owing to competition from
foreign countries. Mr. Ernest Gates, vice-president
of the federation, quoted remarkable figures showing
the growth of unemployment in the Bradford trade
during the last few months. Trade-union benefit
figures, which were apart from Government relief,
showed 40 per cent, increase in part-time payments
among spinners and weavers. One combing firm had
had to adopt part-time for the first time for 40 years.
This is happening in practically all Britain’s
key industries. The world-shortage of goods
which followed the finish of the war has long
since been overtaken, and all those countries
which were producing for export in 1914,
and many which were not, are pouring
manufactured articles over their newly-
erected tariff walls. In face of this situation
the British Freetrader, who in many cases
is a manufacturer, goes on clamoring for
more Fre.etrade —with special reference to
those articles which are necessary for his
own business. It did not matter to such
short-sighted individuals that the importa-
tion of cheap German coal recently threat-
ened the safety of the British coal industry ;
and it does not matter to others of their
type that the German goods which are cheap
to them may be ruinously dear to the coun-
try. They demand the reconstruction of
Germany on moral grounds, but what they
are chiefly concerned with is the opportunity
of getting what they require at bargain
rates from the Germans while reconstruction
is in progress. In many respects the position
offers greater opportunities for profiteering
than the brightest days of the Great War.
The British manufacturer who is also a
Freetrader wants from a Germany freed of
French domination raw or half-finished pro-
ducts : iron, for example, delivered in Eng-
land at a figure against which no British
firm could compete. This is splendid busi-
ness for the importer-manufacturer, who gets
for his finished product just as much as he
would if well-paid Britishers had benefited
from all the processes of production; but the
effect on the unemployment figures must be
calamitous. For every such bargain a fresh
collection of indigent people at 18s. per
week per family is placed on the backs of
the taxpayers, and a fresh horde of despe-
rate toilers make for foreign parts, there to
give their native land the worst advertise-
ment any country can receive—that of being-
incapable of supporting the cream of its
working classes.
The British Freetrader has always pur-
sued this selfish policy. “Carpe diem ” is
the most appropriate motto for him, and as
an alternative or subsidiary rallying cry:
“The Devil take the coming generations.”
If the Freetrade influences in England which
are behind the present agitation to re-create
Germany at the expense of France are suc-
cessful, there will doubtless be a tremendous
boom in those industries which are able at.
the moment to exploit Germany’s dirt-cheap
offerings. A vast amount of English money
must continue to be made so long as Ger-
man Governments maintain their present
attitude of whining humility, and while Ger-
man workers occupy the status of coolies.
However,, this golden age will not last a
moment longer than the time when a revivi-
fied Germany is able to assert itself. When
that dark hour arrives many now flourishing
British industries will be quite dead, snowed
under by products which, as Germany re-
covers its moral and energy, should be as
good as they are cheap, and the rest should
be ready for the axe. Already the Germans
have a number of increasingly profitable mar-
kets to themselves —Czechoslovakia, Rou-
mania, Yugo-Slavia, Bulgaria and Austria,
which, before the war, imported annually
about £15,000,000 worth of British manufac-
tures. Despite the stern measures the French
have taken in the Ruhr since the beginning
of the year, the dividends of German textile
factories, food-products companies, and even
of metallurgical and mining concerns are
booming, while Thyssen, the Peter Kloeck-
ner trust and Krtjpps have been turning out
screws, locks, cameras, locomotive engines,
cash registers, agricultural machinery, etc.,
as well as many hundreds of thousands of
tons of pig-iron and steel, at unprecedentedly
low prices. And simultaneously the national
mercantile marine is steadily approaching its
pre-war strength. If Germany can do as
much in shackles, its capacity when freed,
and after it has acted as Britain’s chief sup-
plier for 10 or 15 years, may be imagined.
It will have won the economic mastery of
the world, and by so doing have dedicated
millions of Britishers yet unborn to the dead-
end or shameful callings, without firing a
shot or sacrificing a life. The British Em-
pire, which has been menaced for half a cen-
tury by the prolific seafaring and colonising
German races, as against France’s diminish-
ing population of home-stayers, will have
been sacrificed to further enrich a few Brit-
ish families ‘which already have more money
than they can use.
THE CASE FOR AUSTRALIAN
PICTURES.
Remarks of a man in the trade:—
W. Scott Fell, M.L.A., asserts (B. 6/9/’23) that
£4,000,000 is annually remitted to America by
the Australian agents for foreign films, that being
the profit on their turnover. His statements are as
far from the facts as those of most people outside
the trade. The revenue of these supplying concerns
approximates £978,000 p.a., Paramount (Adolph
Zukor’s show) pulling in about £250,000. Of this
£978,000 about 40 p.c. is spent locally in rents,
salaries, wages, printing, advertising and taxes.
Therefore, “the sum actually remitted to America”
is nearer £700,000 than £4,000,000 p.a.
Admittedly, the tribute paid to the foreigner is
huge compared with the exhibitor’s profit. Owing to
the exorbitant cut demanded by Adolph Zukor,
Caul Laemmle, Hiram Abrams, Myiion Selznick
and so forth, not 10 p.c. of the 900-odd Australian
showmen are making money. W. Scott Fell can be
assured that every showman longs for the time when
hts can get British pictures capable of filling his
theatre, so that the yoke of U.S. oppression may be
thrown off. But, since 90 per cent, of the films
shown in Britain are American, and the British
producer cannot be induced to spend more money on
his films and to give them an international appeal,
the prospect of a change for the better is small.
There is no hostility to British films, as such.
On the contrary, every showman would rather have
them, provided he was certain they would please
his patrons, because —leaving sentiment out of the
argument—they cost him less. But the public, in
one mighty vote, has given its decision—by staying
away. Australian Films, a company wholly Austra-
lian, buys in any market where merit exists, and
from time to time introduces every English picture
of note, but so far with very ordinary success.
So far as Australian pictures are concerned, Scott
Fell should ask E. J. Carroll, who lost £25,000
trying to introduce a big method of producing into
the Australian industry. Here again those who
patronise the movies answer the question. When
Australian pictures were a novelty they prospered,
but when productions became common the public no
longer wanted them. In motion-pictures, as in Art,
the public is internationalist, and will tolerate no
restrictions of the sort aimed at by W. Scott Fell.
The financial success or failure of a picture is deter-
mined by merit, and merit alone. Were merit con-
trolled by regulation the showman would have to
shut his doors.
* * * *
To which it may be replied:—
(1) But “merit” (or what the gentleman means
by the word) is already controlled by regulation.
The most “meritorious” imported film is liable to
be rejected, or deprived of its most pornographic
passages, by a censor. If the general average of
screen-plays were clean and decent, or if movie
crowds were composed of adults only, there would
be no need for censors. The justification for their
employment is that so many foreign pictures exhibit
the capering inanities and indecencies of painted
morons and filthy-minded brutes, and that so many
of those who witness these putrid productions are
children of the school-going age. It is absurd to
suggest that a community which accepts the censor-
ship, and complains only that it isn’t strong enough,
would strike against a limitation of film imports and
an ad valorem duty, designed to stimulate the produc-
tion of healthy Australian pictures instead of foreign
muck.
(2) The statement as to the unsatisfactory quality
of the British article is interesting in a general
way —thrice interesting, no doubt, to the British
Trade Commissioner. But it has no bearing on the
argument that more pictures can, and should, be
made in Australia. The chances are that Britain
will never have much of a Aim industry. Its climate
is unsuitable, in the first place, and so are its
Freetrade policy and spirit. Without some form of
Protection large-scale production of pictures is out
of the question. Moreover, the war stopped film-
making in Britain for five years, while the Yankees
were working at top speed. The ground thus lost
the British photo-play merchant has not recovered,
nor is he likely to recover it while he enjoys the
blessings of Freetrade.
(3) Australia has a superlatively fine motion-
picture climate—none finer anywhere. This ensures
good photography and makes for economical produc-
tion (or will when the industry is established) ; in
countries less favored actors and others engaged for
screen work have to loaf round for long periods
under lowering skies, and salaries go on all the time.
Australia, likewise, owing to the majority of its
six million people being city- and town-dwellers
with a bent for theatrical entertainments and the
money to indulge it, is one of the half-dozen best
film markets in the world. In this respect, and in
those of sunlight and remoteness from competitors, it
offers greater advantages to the local producer than
Sweden. Yet Sweden, with about the same popula-
tion and a much smaller proportion of town resi-
dents, possesses a first-class film industry—protected
of course.
* * * *
(4) The Bulletin doesn’t know for a fact that
E. J. Carroll dropped £25,000 in the production of
Australian pictures (more power to his elbow for
trying!), but is prepared to believe it. Had H.
V. McKay and others been exposed to the shameless
and pitiless dumping with which the occasional Aus-
tralian film-maker has to contend, the manufacture
of agricultural implements, now employing, directly
and indirectly, about 8000 Australian workmen,
would have died out long ago. The film man’s
position is the same as the implement manufac-
turer’s would be were American ploughs, drills, cul-
tivators, binders and strippers being sold here at,
say, one-twentieth the current price of similar Aus-
tralian articles. Suppose it costs £4OOO or £SOOO
to produce an Australian screen-play. A positive
copy of an American picture which has already-
earned its profit in the U.S. market can be struck off
for a penny a foot (the Germans are printing posi-
tives for a halfpenny a foot), or £29,35. ,4d. for a
7000 ft. film. The duty on this article, landed at
Sydney (postage and cartage are trifling expenses),
is lid. per foot, or £43 15s. altogether. Even if six
positives are imported the American supplier com-
petes against the Australian producer with the odds
ten to one in his favor. Among other things, he
has an enormously larger amount of money to spend
in newspaper advertising, and he spends it lavishly—
so lavishly that the low and brutal characteristics


of his country’? screen “art,” and the effect on the
vouno- \ustralian mind of its coarse vulgarity and
lubricity and eternal American slate, are never dis-
cussed in newspapers which on less important sub-
jects are all shriek.
(5) Some very poor pictures have undoubtedly
been turned out in Australia. Unintelligent peop e
have drifted into the business and d >' ] ffed out again,
having in the meantime fabricated bad ims on e
worst American models. But in view o io screen
success of Enid Bennett, Sylvia Bbemei., Lfal L
sox. Mae Busch, Annette ellerman,
Cook, “Snub” Pollard Rupert Jlmak j a
dozen others, it is idle to c insinuate
can’t make good pictures, pi epos ei s , '
that their fellow-countrymen wouldn t suppoit them it
made And stupid as some Australian productions
maae. Ana, i , • if nv .
have been, they were rather less depressing, it an
thin°- than the foreign junk that has been coming to
hand' lately. 1., common with other subjects of
George V. Australians are tired of turgid filmed ver-
sions of American fiction, of vaunting vulgarisations
of American a nd European history, of the Yank being
presented as a hero and the Briton as a bully, a
coward 0 r an oaf, and of seeing gloating colored
men maul white women about, As a substitute for
the spoken drama the photo-play has ludicrously
failed. To make the old stuff tolerable picture
showmen are now obliged to go in for expensive “pro-
logues,” ballets and the like. ’The cry of the public
ail the world over is for shorter and brighter pic-
tures. At least half the Australian demand could
be satisfied by Australian production, but to render
this practicable there must, owing to the peculiar
circumstances of the case, be (l) a limitation of
imports, and (2) a protective duty, based on the
real value of admitted films, so far as it can be
ascertained, and not on the cost of taking them
from the negative, or anything like that. The
Bulletin asks itself whether these measures are
warranted. In consideration of the drain of gold
to America, of the urgent need for more local con-
sumers of our surplus beef, wheat, fruit, jam and
numerous other products, and of the still greater
necessity for inspiring the home-grown youngster
to become a genuine Australian instead of a cheap
fastt

velopment of his manners, character ancl opinions, and
the GSU.S. picture is the last abomination of Time)
-in consideration of these and other facts pertinent
_ . . ~
to the issue, the answer is in the affirmative.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Tainted Turf.
The most marked characteristic of horse-
racing as pursued in Australia nowadays is
the bland indifference of most of its fol-
lowers to the ethics which govern decent
callings. When The Bulletin commented
on the Polycrates case- —the Macabthur
Onslow stable had collected a third of the
Tattersall’s prize from a syndicate which
had drawn one of its horses —a trainer of
good repute offered this defence: —
I have known of owners who were only too glad
to accept such a present on their own behalf, with-
out any recognition of the trainer or his staff.
If a surgeon, having begun an operation on
one of this gentleman’s near and dear rela-
tives, paused to mention that he expected a
"present” of £660 in addition to his fee,
there would probably be trouble; and it
would not be materially lessened by an ex-
planation from the surgeon that the money
was to be divided amongst those employed
about the surgery. The public is as much
entitled to expect a racing stable to do its
best with its horses as it is to expect a
surgeon to do his best with the knife: cer-
tain it is that neither owner nor surgeon has
any right to accept the promise of a
“present” on the implied understanding—or,
at any rate, because of the existence of a fear
in the mind of somebody interested—that un-
less the assurance is forthcoming something
of a maleficent nature may happen. But
in the Australia® racing business, apparently,
such a procedure is regarded as perfectly
regular, not to say commendable; and that
even the A.J.C. committee accepts this view
is indicated by its neglect to take action in
the Polycrates matter. This being the
moral gesture of headquarters, it is easy to
picture what goes on at the pony meetings
—gigantic ramps run largely by criminals for
criminals on the wages of fool-workers. Syd-
ney Sun interviewed some “prominent pony
trainers” last week and got the following
naif disclosures from one
The present system encourages us to keep fourth-
rate horses in work. I have two myself. It pays
me now. to keep these horses. When they win
they certainly advance a division, but all I have
to do is run them half a dozen byes and they
are again among the “goats.” The A.R.C. encourages
us to pull them up.
Another remarked: —
We are frightened to buy good horses, as often
the “goats” would interfere with them in races,
although they had absolutely no chance of ever
winning a race. Horses which never do anything
but interfere with others should not be allowed
to race. I could beat them with my hack, and
their owner-trainers knew it. They were only
nominated for the purpose of “getting at” triers.
The position, in short, is that most of the
animals on which punters at “the ponies”
pile their cash are unreliable duds at best;
and that, anyhow, they are denied a fair
chance owing to the presence of even more
hopeless animals which are there to “get at
the triers.” Sometimes the services of the
second class of competitors are not required:
those who have attracted favorable atten-
tion from backers of form are “running
byes,” or being “pulled up.” And apart
from these more or less public swindles there
are the private bargains—struck days before
the race, maybe—between stables and sweep
winners, owners and professional punters,
jockeys and bookmakers, and any number of
similar combinations of conspirators. The
net result is that hundreds of thousands of
citizens are being robbed yearly for the bene-
fit of certain malefactors whose cynically un-
scrupulous methods would not be tolerated in
any other calling. If our Legislatures
primarily considered the public interest they
would abolish proprietary racing, and insist
on the A.J.C. disciplining wealthy owners
and bookmakers who overstep the mark,
equally with obscure trainers and jockeys!
Unfortunately, both political parties are
under financial obligations to the betting
nabobs. With the departure of the Party
Government system the zany who imagines
he can beat books, owners, trainers, jockeys
and their attendant parasites might be pro-
tected from himself. At present those who
live by fleecing him are as safe as though, in
another place, they had the backing of a
squared jury.
•
The Curse of 1867.
Tasmania’s financial troubles are of long
standing and due to many causes, but the
reason why they have suddenly become so
much worse than usual is the cumulative pre-
ference dividend. The loan money with
which everything productive and very many
tilings unproductive have been built by the
States in Australia is all cumulative pref.
capital. Full dividends have to be paid on
it before it has begun to earn anything; later,
when it is earning a little but not enough ;
and, later still, when it is lost and will
never earn anything more while the world
lasts. Add that the preference shareholders
have a chance to raise their cumulative divi-
dend every now and then, on loan-renewal
day, and only an infallible Government
could be sure of making a profit out of the
business. Infallible Governments have, how-
ever, been noticeably scarce. Tasmania,
especially in its early days, was managed
instead by prize fools, whose capacity for in-
vesting the loan money to the worst dis-
advantage was a marvel. As far back as
1900 the island’s interest bill was £316,417,
of which the net return from loan works
amounted to £49,190, and the other £267,227
was paid by taxation. In none of the States
did “reproductive works” pay for themselves,
for N. S. Wales had to find 23 per cent, of
its interest out of taxes; S. Australia, 24
per cent.; Victoria, 25 per cent.; and Queens-
land, 52 per cent. But Tasmania’s dead
weight of 84 per cent, was the record. When
Tassy’s little Established Church was dis-
established the parsons were even compen-
sated out of loans, and when the isle had a
sort of financial cleaning up in 1867 it
started fair by putting the accumulated short-
age among the “permanent and reproductive
works.” Partly as a reminder of the gay
doings of 1867 and years thereabout, the
Tasmanian now digs down in his pocket for
more tax-money than the man of Westralia,
S. Australia or Victoria ; and the people work
hard for wages which are always a little
below the Commonwealth average. Lately
the Government has fallen a victim to a
laudable ambition. It has vast manufactur-
ing possibilities in its water-power, and most
of its visible future lies that way. Unfor-
tunately this fact was only realised with
sudden energy just when loan money was
dear and when labor wasn’t cheap. The
debt leaped from £15,000,000 in 1918 to
nearly £22,000,000 in 1922. The interest bill
rose in the same time from £601,000 to
£1,045,000. They both took further leaping
exercise in 1923, and are booked for more
exhibitions in 1924. When private share-
holders start a big enterprise they generally
go hungry for a dividend for the first few
years, but the private cumulative preference
fellow who finds the money for Public Enter-
prise begins collecting before the first sod is
turned. So in the struggle to tide over till
profits come in the authorities propose to stop
dental clinics, the medical inspection of school
children, and free high-school education, to
cut down the size of the Legislature to almost
nothing, to do with half an Agent-General
instead of a whole one, to sack some civil
servants, to reduce trains and generally to
buzz round. To economise on the school
children seems pitiable enough, but where
the interest bill eats up half the revenue
there is little room for sentiment. Possibly
the water-power scheme, when it has time
to earn its oats, will prove the one good loan
spec, of the day, but at present the fine col-
lection of curses which began to be hatched
as far back as 1867 are coming home to
roost in great style. And if the same breed
of curses don’t do the same thing in the other
States it will be only because the Govern-
ments started on a policy of economy and
sane finance. At present there is no sign of
that anywhere; on the contrary, every State
is doing precisely what Tasmania did, and
is increasing its debt with the greatest energy
at the very time when interest is highest and
the labor and other return for money spent is
lowest.
Our Undemocratic Jury System.
A deputation waited on the N. S. Wales
Minister for Justice the other day with a
request which merited attention. Its spokes-
man asked that provision should be made to
enable members of the proletai’iat to serve
on juries. For whatever reason, our jury-
system is becoming an increasing byword and
reproach throughout Australia. Dr. Jethro
Brown, president of the. S. Aus. Industrial
Court, informed the Law Reform Commission
which sat recently in Adelaide that it “ought
to be either mended or ended” —a view with
which most citizens who have watched it in
operation will concur. A good deal of the
trouble can. no doubt, be traced to the tre-
mendous schedule of exemptions, which is
added to as fast -as any profession becomes
articulate and influential. Dentists, for ex-
ample, were added last week in N. S. Wales
to the subsection which relieves “physicians,
surgeons, apothecaries and druggists in
actual practice” of service. It is not sur-
prising, since practically the whole intelli-
f/entsia of the community never enters a
jury-room, that verdicts are often inept. Bar-
risters and solicitors, managing directors,
managers and cashiers of banks, mining man-
agers and under-managers of mines “employ-
ing not less than 10 men” ; M’s.L.C.—these
and other members of the exempted classes
are usually men of some means, and to that
extent are likely to be immune to the
advances of the jury-squarer. And there
is another reason why their presence in cer-
tain types of cases might make for justice.
A knowledge of class-conventions is often as
necessary for the purposes of a correct ver-
dict as brains or integrity. A rockchopper
who came home and found his wife enter-
taining a man-friend at tea would begin per-
haps to suspect her of infidelity; a Govern-
ment House habitu6 would feel affronted if
the men he entertained did not sometimes
call on his wife. And an appreciation of
such distinctions on the part of jurors might
conceivably make all the difference between
a just finding and an unjust one in, say, a
divorce matter. At present, while hardly
anyone is forced to serve on a jury who has
over £3OOO a year, no on e is supposed to do
so in N. S. Wales who is without an income
or at least £3O a year, apart from
personal earnings. The available resi-
due contains some of the poorest and
most unimaginative mentality in the country.
They are the peers neither of the pauper nor
of the plutocrat; and they possess certain
ingrained and entirely erroneous opinions
concerning the morals of both classes which
are prejudicial to balanced judgment. The
logical arrangement in a country where edu-
cation is universal, and where no distinction
is supposed to be made in the administration
of justice between man and man, is for every-
body to be both qualified and liable for jury
service. To the deputation under discussion
Minister for Justice Ley returned the dis-
ingenuous answer that “as a working man
he knew too well the financial burdens put
on the toilers, and declined, therefore, to take
a step involving members of the proletariat
in the sacrifice of their wages.” But the
point would not arise if jury service were
remunerated, as it ought to be in every case,
on, at least, a minimum-wage basis. The
compulsory juror is admittedly as essential
to the State as the compulsory trainee, and,
as the Government of Queensland is the
first to recognise in. a bill now before the
House, there is no reason why any less demo-
cratic methods of choosing him should be
employed.
Handcuffs and a Glass of Beer.
In its Licensing Bill now before Parliament
the N. S. Wales Government refuses to put
to the people whether there shall be prohibi-
tion without compensation or not. It in-
ferentially declares that there are some things
which cannot properly be referred to the
people for decision. The Bulletin agrees
with the Government that this is so —at any
rate, in the present state of education, and
as appeals to the people are now conducted.
But if it is wrong to allow the public to
decide whether a man shall lose a few pounds
to which he has a sort of claim, is it less wrong
to wrest from him the right to have a glass
of beer because somebody else takes too many
glasses of beer? It is not merely a question
of beer, either. Many men, perhaps more
women, and certainly more children, smoke
too much tobacco. If a general prohibition
directed against beer is a proper subject for
a referendum, then a referendum directed
against tobacco cannot be improper; and if
next month Queensland votes for the prohibi-
tion of liquor, it will issue an invitation for
a further assault upon its personal habits in
the shape of a campaign to prohibit its use
of the pipe. Nor will the insidious attack
upon freedom end there. There are labor
unions which have done bad things; there
are thousands of people who foolishly believe
that we would be better without unions. If
we encourage these attacks—and we can-
not encourage them better than by making
them successful —we shall presently have de-
mands for referendums to decide to-day
whether labor unions shall be put out-
side the law and to-morrow whether
employers’ organisations shall be treated
in the same way. There is hai'dly
a good thing in the world that cannot be made
a bad thing by misapplication. The Devil
can even quote Scripture to serve his own
ends. Are we to abolish the good thing be-
cause of its misapplication? Or is it not the
sensible plan to prevent so far as possible
the misapplication? That is the question im-
mediately ahead of Queensland. If it decides
for prohibition, it will confess that democracy
is a failure, inasmuch as it is powerless to
make and enforce laws for the regulation of
the people, and is driven to put handcuffs and
leg-irons on the whole community, being
otherwise incapable of preventing some of
them from doing wrong.
•
The Tasmanian Drift.
J. A. Lyons, leader of the Labor party in
the Tasmanian Assembly, puts his case:—
Tasmania contains for its area greater natural
■wealth than any other State. Providence supplied
all the requisites for a prosperous, happy and con-
tented people. Over 60 years ago Tory rule began
in the colony, and it has continued ever since, with
the one small break of two years when Labor held the
reins. When the Tories began they did so with a
country blessed with higlily-productive soil, wonder-
fully rich and varied mineral wealth, forests of
splendid timber, an abundant and never-failing rain-
fall, safe and commodious harbors, a bracing and
health-giving climate, and water-power that has
become the envy of the larger States. With such
assets failure would appear impossible. But the
Tories have achieved the impossible, for after those
60-odd years the State’s population, which is now
considerably less than a quarter of a million, is at
a standstill. The native-born are leaving every
week, and but for Tattersall’s the country would be
bankrupt. That is the monument that stands to-
day to the legislative and administrative genius of
past and present Tory-Liberal-Nationalist Govern-
ments.
Unfortunately the results achieved by the present
Government are more disastrous than those of their
predecessors. Seven years ago a Nationalist Gov-
ernment came into office, where it still remains.
According to its own claims it was composed of
Heaven-born financial geniuses and business men. It
was pledged to cut out Labor’s extravagance, to sub-
stitute a system of rigid economy and to install
sound principles of finance. By these means it
guaranteed to square the ledger. Everything was
lovely in Tasmania’s garden. How have these
pledges been kept? The answer* is found in the
present state of the finances and in an examination
of the financial practices of the Government and its
supporters. These are some of their achievements.
They have cut out Labor extravagance by spending
more on every Department every year since they
came in, and at the same time have actually added
to the number of departments. They have squared
the ledger by providing one small surplus and six
big deficits in seven years. The real accumulated
deficit has grown from £lOB,OOO to nearly one
million. In five years they added to the public debt
half as much as was added by all the Governments
of the past in the previous 60 years. During those
five years the debt increased five times as fast as
the people who have to pay it. The financial posi-
tion to-day is worse than it has ever been in the
State’s history—is so bad, in fact, that the Govern-
ment was recently compelled to cover up the
accumulated deficit by adding it to the permanent
debt, and to make sure that it would remain per-
manent they refused even to provide a sinking-fund
to liquidate it. Not only that, but in the following-
-12 months they created another deficit greater than
the accumulated deficit that they had just funded.
They have presented a “cooked” budget to Parlia-
ment in that they have failed to include in the deficit
the big losses on soldiers’ settlement, or to provide
in this particular year for depreciation of the Hydro-
Electric works, which cost three millions. Also
they forced through Parliament a scheme to seize
the proceeds of the sale of Crown lands and treat
them as revenue. When a business man begins to
meet his trading losses by borrowing, and at the
same time proceeds to realise on his capital assets,
he surely is meditating bankruptcy, a sudden depart-
ure, or a fire. Yet that is exactly what the Tas-
manian Government did in the very last session.
Again, the cost of living in Tasmania is the second
highest in the Commonwealth, and the wages level is
the second lowest. The heaviest burden, propor-
tionately, of taxation falls oh the lower incomes, and
the higher ones get off lightly. The accumulated
effect is seen in the population statistics. The
native-born find other States more attractive than
their owfi, and in spite of our high ' birth-rate our
population remains almost stationary 7 because of the
excess' of departures, over arrivals. The population
practically at a standstill from ye.ar to
year. For the 12 months ended March last there
was a natural increase of 3800, but in the same
period we lost by emigration 2858. The most recent
figures show that in males the natural increase can-
not keep pace with the loss by departures; in
other words, while baby-boys, are .coming into Tas-
mania the men are getting out. ~ Bad as this .is, it
would have beep infinitely, worse but for the fact
that thousands flfad employment in industries created
by the Hydro-Electric scheme which Labor estab-
lished during its short term of office.
Briefly, the Nationalists have almost crippled the
State financially and are driving our people away.
The position is serious, but if the present muddlers
remain much, longer it will be desperate., Nothing
can save the State but an increase in the number of
its people and in the wealth that they produce. We
must hold our own native-born and make room for
thousands more from outside. To do this needs a
policy of real progress and development born of con-
fidence in our country. Such a policy cannot
emanate from those who have checked development
for two-thirds of a century. The extension of exist-
ing industries, the creation of new ones, and the
encouragement of the primary producers by helping
them to get free of the middleman—all theso are
necessary if the financial position is to be righted
and the State enabled to go ahead.

No Job for a General.
With every recurring It. S. League presiden-
tial election. Federal or State, an attempt is
made by misguided persons to push an ex-
warrior of high rank into the position. The
N. S. Wales branch of the League was badly
handicapped two or three years ago because
of the prominent part taken in its councils
by certain political generals, and now there
is a suggestion from Victoria that General
Monash should be the League’s Federal
president. A general is ipso facto an unwise
choice for such a job. Being himself .an
authoritarian by temperament and training,
he tends to be on the side of authority at all
times; and this places him in a false position
when, in a fight for a principle, the Diggers
are found on one side and a Government on
the other. Of all Australia’s galaxy of fight-
ing generals the only one who lias shown, any
disposition to stand up to officialdom is
“Pompey” Elliott, and even his radicalism
is of a modified nature. General Monash
lives professionally and socially in an atmo-
sphere of conservatism, and his point of
view could only be, in most instances, that
of the Tory politicians and officials who are
his friends. The R. S League has achieved
some remarkable results in the past year
or so, taking into consideration the fact that
the world-slump in heroism reached this
country fully 12 months ago. The difficulty
after the glamor has faded has always been
to get fair treatment for, the incapacitated
and their helpless dependants. The position
of these people is relatively good in Aus-
tralia ; but their rights have not been secured
without fighting, and most of it has been
done by a few League officials (Federal and
State) under the direction of their presi-
dents. Free medical benefits for widows and
widowed mothers ; special pensions in cases
of total incapacity ; living allowances to cases
of two-thirds incapacity while out of work ;
transfer of A.I.F. mental cases from lunatic
asylums to Repat. mental hospitals—-these
are but a few of the concessions that the
R. S. League has won in face of the opposi-
tion of Red Tape. The Ryan scandal would
doubtfully have been brought to a satisfac-
tory conclusion under the direction of a
general. A general is invariably a Pangloss
as regards appointments made in high places:
everything must be for the best that ema-
nates from a headquarters. The ex-soldier
who most appreciates the brains of a
Monash, the courage of a Rosenthal, or
the soldierly good fellowship of a Rykie
would be the first, probably, to deny the
value of any of them in an R. S. League posi-
tion of authority. When such men are
chosen this type of member drops out, and
so the League loses both in membership and
in the prestige which is secured by the per-
formance of good works. A League presi-
dent or other official can hardly be too
humble militarily or socially: the require-
ment is that he shall have nothing of the
troopship adjutant in his spiritual make-up
—in other words, that he shall always be
ready, in the interests of justice, to stand
up to the political orderly-rooms. The
Leagues will only become impotent, and
hence superfluous, when they start electing
a different type to their governing bodies.

The Wowser and His Day of Power.
“Whitehall” theorises: —•
The sectarian issue has social repercussions which
are but dimly understood by an afflicted community.
For example, our papers often print items like this:
Over 100 signed a petition to the Pieton (N.S.W.)
Council, protesting against sports being played at
Victoria Park on Sunday. The council, by live
votes to three, supported the petition.
In England, where modern Sabbatarianism origi-
nated, Sunday sport has become a convention. With all
the great roads full of rich men’s cars, and with the
Thames crowded with rich men’s motor-boats, it
would have been hypocrisy to deny the post-war clerk
his Sunday tennis. In any event, nobody of im-
portance tried to do it. There is practically no
sectarianism in the England of to-day, and the
result is that questions which here, as in Ulster,
are decided on irrelevancies can be dealt with
on their merits. The workers of Pieton would dis-
port themselves with alacrity in Victoria Park if
permitted. The old Scotch habit qf sitting indoors
oh the Lord’s Day makes no appeal to Australians.
Pieton sees a stream of motor-cars pouring through
it every Sunday en route to haunts of the affluent,
such as Bowral and Moss Vale, where Sunday tennis
is as respectable as Sunday breakfast. Its residents
cannot fail to argue that, if Sabbath desecration
is not blameworthy on the part of those who are
in a financial position to devote all the week to
enjoyment, it might well be permitted in the case
of artisans, shop-assistants and the like. But their
councillors and legislators say “Nol” in a shocked
tone, and by five votes to three. Why? Because the
sectarian issue is involved in the business.
The status of the sectarian specialist is peculiar.
If a politician he rarely becomes a party leader ;
if a clergyman he rarely has a congregation that
pays him a living wage. Between elections there
is a tendency to regard him as a crank, a nuisance
and a superfluity. But underlying it all is an un-
easy realisation, more especially on the part of our
elected persons, that this dusty, scuffling, little
man, whose grammar is poor and who is in chronic
difficulties with the tradesman, will loom forth at
least once in every three years as a Serious Influence.
About a month before every election, in communities
where the Christian creeds slang-whang one another
for the glory of God, persons hitherto almost or quite
unknown spring to the front and begin speaking
with authority. They tell of powerful organisations
ready to move as one man and one woman at
their behest. They threaten weak-kneed candidates
and moral backsliders with political extinction. The
odd thing is that, during the month in question,
they do enjoy a certain power. Citizens become
religious who have not entered a church for years:
the iron morality of a Cromwell or of a young
Mahomet is proclaimed by persons who before the
politico-religious revival were tolerant of frivolity, and
who are destined to revert to latitudinarianism the
moment the polling is at an end. A considerable
proportion of the M’s.L.A. in such a State as N. S.
Wales, where sectarianism has always had a vogue,
keep these recurring manifestations constantly in
mind. They know that the electors want to be
allowed to play games on Sundays—know it, that
is to say, during 35 months in every three years.
But they also know that, for the duration of the
one month that matters so far as their Parliamentary
billets are concerned, these same electors are capable
of being persuaded that they hate Sabbath sport as
heartily as a Skye crofter, and are prepared to rend
any legislator who offers it to them. It is this
triennial aberration which is the chief hope of the
Prohibition party. It was a subtle mind which con-
ceived the phrase “Rome, Rum and Ruin.” The anti-
drink section is negligible in the festive Ma State
as an all-round-the-year quantity, but at fixed inter-
vals it is capable of being reinforced by thousands
of good Protestant drinkers who will only wake up,
on the day after the election, to find that they have,
in a convivial manner of speaking, committed suicide.
Here again they do things much more rationally in
England, where the liquor question is approached
from the national as against the sectarian angle.
The Classics and Getting a Living.
“M. 8.” offers some suggestions :
It is only to be expected that a distinguished
classical scholar recently in Australia should lay
stress on the value of classical study as part of
education. Such study undoubtedly earns a place
in university training, although it is questionable
whether the learning of the Latin and Greek tongues
is indispensable to it; but as far as concerns extra-
university education the study of such allegedly cul-
tural subjects is already woefully overdone.
On account of examination requirements, which
inevitably govern school curricula, the student cannot
avoid taking a number of subjects, which will have
for the majority no practical utility, as well as
being uncongenial and almost devoid of cultural value.
The study of a language, for example, being merely
a means to an end to be obtained with infinitely
more interest and less labor by the reading of trans-
lations, is a process which in itself possesses little
or no cultural value. It seems a sad waste of time,
more so when we reflect that later on the student
will frequently have to put in weary hours after his
daily toil in acquiring the knowledge he really re-
quiries in life, much of which could have been
more easily learnt in youth.
The existing system can pay scant attention to
vocational requirements, and the natural result is a
crop of social evils due to the industrial and com-
mercial unfitness of multitudes of Australians. A
man skilled in his vocation tends to be happy in his
work and a reasonable citizen, and a system of edu-
cation primarily vocational in its outlook would
be a great force for the social harmony that we need
a lot more of. Not that such a system need disregard
the cultivation of the mind and the development Of the
reasoning faculties. And here, where it might be
expected to make a good showing, the existing sys-
tem for all its cramming, is, it possible, even more
disappointing. While great place is given to mere
frills possessing little or no cultural value, the
study of more promising subjects is stultified by the
method of treatment —a corollary of the examina-
tion system. Much call is made on the memory,
which is stuffed with data, but little on the reason-
ing powers. History and geography become a pro-
cession of names and dates. Amidst the plethora of
other learning the study of English literature suffers
comparative neglect, and its educational possibilities
and power to arouse the genuine interest of the
student, which are great, are but feebly exploited.
It would not be untrue to say that many students
have read more Latin poetry, the metrical values
of which are lost on them, in the original, than
they have English. Australian literature and his-
tory are Cinderelas. Lastly, little regard is paid
to the intellectual bent of the student. It is not
extraordinary that large numbers of the victims of
the system acquire a nausea towards learning gen-
erally, or that most of them rapidly forget the
bulk of the quasi-knowledge they have been crammed
with.
The root reason of the failure of the system to
show more satisfying results is that it is enamored of
the fetich called an “all-round” education. The
aim seems a false one to have in elementary educa-
tion. Time would seem to be rather short to lay

even a proper foundation, and if it weren’t it seems
a futile process, seeing that the bulk of it is destined
never to receive the superstructure. Besides, the
men we are least ashamed of, the world over, don't
seem to have anything approaching an “all-round”
education. A profound knowledge of one or two
classes of knowledge and a smattering of anything
else likely to be generally helpful seems to be the
rale. Both vocationally and culturally, man is
cut out to be a specialist. Another curious fact is
that a surprising number of those carrying the
most various and weighty intellectual cargo are
mediocrities. Amongst university professors, for in-
stance, only the scientists —who, however, are usually
not all-round men, and have an advantage through
their ready access to apparatus—have achieved any-
thing great. A surprisingly small number of great
writers come from their ranks.
For my part I don’t think it would have been a

day W'as little more than the three R’s and

vocational training, the reading of good English and
Australian literature, according to taste, and, as
extra study, whatever subjects the child feels
most interested in, is a system of elementary educa-
tion I would have great hopes of. The diet is lighter
than that now prescribed, but more would stay on
the stomach.
“0.K.”: Victoria’s Premier is about to
repeat the futility of appointing a royal com-
mission to inquire into the high cost of
living. Prendergast, of the Labor Opposi-
tion, who probably has kept count of the
futilities, grumbles that there have already
been about five inquiries in the last three
or four years; but, seeing that Prendergast
himself gave the cue for this latest farce by
asking Lawson what steps he proposed to
take for dealing with the high cost of “food
and groceries in Victoria,” the leader of the
Opposition seems not less evasive than the
Premier. In the first place, why do Pren-
dergast and other manufacturers of goods
w r hich are not foodstuffs charge the “present
high cost of living” against house-rent and
food only? Housewives of politicians
are not less informed than other men’s
housewives as to where the shoe pinches.
It pinches everywhere, and Prendergast
knows it. High prices rose by combination
and are maintained by the same simple
means. Let Premier Lawson amuse himself
by discovering why Mrs. Lawson pays so
much more for choice perfumes than she did
before the war. Let him ask Why the in-
creased cost of living includes a dispropor-
tionately large increase in the Chow’s charge
for washing shirts and collars, etc. No
Christian combine has been more loyal to
its principles than the heathen laundry alii-
ance. And even as the conspiracy of “shirt-
Johns” has been met, so must the combines
of manufacturers and distributors be met.
The consumption of boiled shirts with starch
in them has been reduced, and the consumption
of food, clothing and luxuries must likewise
fall before there can be an appreciable reduc-
tion in the cost of living. The only cure for
combined profiteering is self-denial, prac-
tised on an organised system. Only a few
purchases are of daily or weekly indispen-
sability. Only some of the food that is bought
is of real value to the life of the country,
whilst its actual drink and smoke require-
ments are but a tithe of its expenditures on
tobacco and booze. Profiteering in this coun-
try has outlived its rapacity in less favored
lands, and there is a reason why. Australia
has not yet been disciplined to learn the
lesson of “how to do without,” which is the
hardest of tasks for a spoilt young country
to learn.
•—
The Countrywomen’s Association of N. S.
Wales is trying to stir up public interest in
the establishment of maternity wards in
country towns. It is a scandal that so little
has been done outside the capital for mothers
and their newly-born. Every country town
of any importance has a hospital which will
open its doors to any old derelict who is ill,
but there is an impassable “no admission”
for the expectant mother. Such a state of
affairs is not even sensible from the point of
view of the storekeeper-committeeman.
The ancient drunk who squanders his earn-
ings goes out, as a rule, withouffeontributing
a bean to the funds; the honest •working-
man’s wife in most cases would gladly pay
fees. Tne Government seems indifferent.
Condobolin energetically collected funds and
turned the old gaol into a maternity hos-
pital ; but the Government refuses to subsi-
dise on the grounds that there is already a
public hospital in the same town —this re-
gardless of the fact that the “other hospital”
is limited in its usefulness. No doubt a
separate building is the least economical way
to conduct the thing. Two buildings mean
two separate staffs and other expense. As a
matter of economy the maternity ward
should belong to the District Hospital.
If that be the argument of the Gov-
ernment, then its course is quite simple;
if it believes that provision for the
nursing and care of expectant mothers is
important—and it is impossible to see how
a Government which professes to be anxious
to promote settlement in the country can be-
lieve anything else —then it should make that
provision a condition of the hospital subsidy.
“Sierra” : The proposal to proclaim the Ku
Klux Klan an unlawful association in Aus-
tralia is like suggesting the use off a steam-
hammer to crack a flea. It would be poor
policy, too, for the noisy gang of mischievous
sectarians would like nothing better than to
pose as the martyrs of a brutal Government
controlled by Unseen Forces, Hidden Hands
and other stage properties. Australian
democracy is of a different brand from that
of the U.S.A., where a mixture of black and
inferior white races forms a suitable cul-
ture for breeding frenzied bigots, secret
societies and murder leagues. The Ku Klux
maniacs in Australia have no prospect of
ever rising above the status of the bands
of vicious morons, such as the Rock Push
and Bouverie Forty, that infested Sydney
and Melbourne 30 years ago. Hostile public
opinion and the ordinary process of law
settled these, and the same influences may
be trusted to deal with their successors.
Meanwhile, the Klan Klorganisers are being
chiacked and good-humoredly counted out by
Australian crowds every Sunday on Sydney
Domain.
«
“Gossan” on mine-fire fighting:—
“Sulphide” (B. 13/9/’23), in a par about the Bell-
bird colliery disaster and the failure to provide
oxygen jackets for rescue work, states that several
mine officials were gassed recently while examining
the B. 11. Central, and insinuates they were to blame
for taking unnecessary risks. He seems to have
overlooked the difference between fire gases in
collieries and those in metalliferous mines. The gas-
sing in the B. H. Central, which was very slight,
was due to the cumulative effects of minute quanti-
ties of gas during an examination into the control
of the ventilating currents. When it is mentioned
that the examination lasted 12 hours, and, further,
that no attempt was made to penetrate into any
dangerous, atmosphere, the charge of carelessness is
surely disproved. Nobody will question the value of
rescue stations and rescue apparatus, but the men
using the apparatus must be trained and in most
cases selected men. There is am - instance on
record of two American returned soldiers working as
miners who went fire-fighting in their Army gas-masks,
and as a result of their misplaced confidence were
suffocated. Even the most approved apparatus must
be used with care, and as it weighs 401 b. the wearers
must be strong men. Another statement I would
like to contradict is that of Mr. Davidson, M.L.A.,
reported ir, Hansard, that, though rescue apparatus
was on the Central mine, there were no trained men
to use it, and consequently the fire spread. As a
matter of fact, men wearing the apparatus were
combating the fire within four hours of its being
reported.
o
As a rule the Vie. Assembly is a well-
behaved House, but it became unruly shortly
after Premier Dawson began his so-called
policy-speech. He had to appeal to Prender-
gast, Opposition Labor-leader, not to be
rude, and to admonish other Labor members.
With interjectors on his own side of the
House he tried to be tolerant, but wasn’t
very successful. The fact was that Lawson
had failed to mould a few magical introduc-
tory sentences with which to grip the atten-
tion of the House. A disappointing prologue
was followed by a commonplace “piece.”
The new programme was the old one of the
last Ministry with imperceptible variations.
Designed for 30 minutes, the speech occu-
pied 50. Given the same material, Shiels
would have held the House spellbound.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Justice Draper, of the Westralian Arbi-
tration Court, recently decided that it was
a fair thing for a Government toiler to work
48 hours out of the 168, and thereupon the
employees’ representative said they must
get the 44-hours-work-andT24-hours-leisu_re
policy by law if arbitration wouldn’t give it.
He didn’t say that it was possible to reduce
the gross output by one-twelfth, and yet keep
up or increase the wages, and at the same
time make industry pay its way. Australia
badly requires to get, out of the clouds; and
the man of the West, above all others, needs
to come to earth and understand that he is
only a two-legged animal minus feathers,
and can no more get the moon by crying
for it, or even by passing a law about it, than
any other person.
A member of Parliament who rises in his
seat to stoutly support a Redistribution Bill
which aims at cutting that seat from under
him is a novelty in Australian politics. But
W.A. has produced one in Mullany, M.L.A.
for Menzies since 1911, and one of the Labor-
ites who pulled out at the time of the con-
scription split. An uneasy impression is
gaining ground, however, that there arc
quite enough malcontents on the Govern-
ment side to help the Labor Opposition wreck
the .measure and preserve the present gross
anomalies.
The latest union hullabaloo is raging
about the remains of that very dead-born
infant the 0.8. U. It must be two years
since the shearers and the coalminers agreed
that it should be dragged into existence, but
the thing never got any farther than the
appointment of an 0.8. U. Provisional Coun-
cil; and since Common Cause, the coalies’
newspaper, started pitching into the A.W.U.
heads, and the latter retorted in kind through
the sheep-barbers’ organs at Sydney and
Brisbane, some of the Provisional Council-
lors haven’t been on speaking terms. Lis-
sauer’s Hymn of Hate was a genial production
compared with the things these comrades and
uplifters of humanity have been saying about
one another. The expulsion of Bailey, the
A.W.U. boss, by a Labor executive, of which
Willis, the coalies’ secretary, is president,
has bi*ought matters to a head. The miners
now insist on the A.W.U. adopting “the com-
plete 0.8. U. scheme, as it stands, within
one month.” Sydney Worker has indi-
cated what the reply will be by courteously
describing Willis as “a smear of insincerity
on the surface of events.”
Another prank of P.R.: —
Presumably there are limits to the political swind-
ling that may be legally practised under the N. S.
Wales variety of eontortional misrepresentation, but
they have yet to be discovered. The rottenness of
the system has been illustrated anew by the transfer
of one of the three Namoi seats in the Leg. Assembly
from P. C. Scully to W. J., his brother. The deed
was done without reference to the electorate; indeed,
the only person who seems to have been taken into
the Scullys’ confidence was State Labor-leader Lang,
whose signature had to be got before the change
could be made. At the general election in March,
1922, P. C. Scully polled 7880 first-preference votes,
and W. J. Scully 1602 (a figure exceeded by two
other defeated candidates), out of 25,931. Without
eontortional misrepresentation one brother couldn’t
have got. in, and had the other to go before the
constituents who rejected him so enthusiastically, it
looks as if he wouldn’t have a hope. Maybe the
abandonment of an office worth at least £l2OO in
salary and privileges was prompted solely by frater-
nal affection. Anyhow, there is nothing to prevent
a member selling his seat to the nearest defeated
candidate on the same ticket, provided both observe
a prudent reticence. Also, in case of a vacancy it
doesn’t matter if the nearest defeated candidate has
figured, since the election, in a noisome scandal,
or developed incipient general paralysis of the insane;
so long as he is not a bankrupt, a convict, or an
inmate of a lunatic asylum, he automatically acquires
the seat.
Ex-Treasurer Lang, the heavy leader of
N.S.W. Labor, continues to issue assurances
that there are no Communists in his mob
despite all the Red Objectives, because the
law and constitution of the party are against
them. For the same reason there are no
hypocrites in the church, and no spies in
the camp, and no white ants in the house.
THEY’D SCORN TO STEAL HIS APPLES.
“Mr. Ley, Minister for Justice (N.S.W.), denies that he is plotting to- overthrow the Government
and take the Premiership.”— Tri-weekly announcement; when it’s not Ley it is somebody else.
EAEROWMAN FULLER: “Here, what’s the trouble?”
ONE OF THE KIDS : “I say it’s Tommy Ley’s turn to tell you that we’re not trying to
steal your apples; Tommy says it’s Joey Carruthers’s; and Joey says it’s
Arthur Cocks’s.”
One reason why Japan’s trouble isn’t so
bad as it looked is that the country has
very little debt. It slid through the war
with much profit in the way of territory and
concessions, and with small expenditure. At
latest advices it owed £359,000,000, or about
£6 10s.'per inhabitant, as against Australia’s
State and Federal total of £920,000,000 or
£930.000,000, or, say, £166 per head. Even
if the disaster had been as bad financially as
distorted fancy painted it, and the Govern-
ment had reimbursed everybody, foreigners
included, which no one dreamed of doing,
Japan would still have been the least-pawned
of the Great Powers, to say nothing of minor
ones like Belgium, and its debt per head
would still have been moderate. It is hard
to say why Theodore never floated a loan in
Japan.
Speaker Levy (N.S.W.) writes denying
that he passed certain strictures on R. W.
Weaver, M.L.A., which were attributed to
him (B. 20/9/’23). The error w-as due to a
misplaced capital S in a published report of
the debate. The actual user of the w-ords (re-
ferred to in the report as the Speaker) was
R. J. Stuart Robertson, M.L.A.
Remarks from the Gallery:—
Vie. Premier Lawson is again indicating that a
papier-mache hand lurks in his velvet glove. His
policy speech was mostly a reiteration of his former-
mild intentions regarding various small things, fol-
lowed by a foggy generalisation on the redistribution
of seats. It now seems that the metropolis will con-
tinue to yearn for more representatives until the
rolls are altered —whenever that may be. Also,
when the long-desired Gas Company Bill made its
appearance, the Premier seized upon a suggestion
that a select committee should inquire into its
allegedly intricate provisions, his show of reluctance
deceiving no one. The committee is to be appointed
this week, and with good management it should be
investigating the question until it is too late to
get the bill through the two Houses. After that
there will be a long recess, so the Gas monoply is
evidently to have another untroubled year.
The Premier of N. S. Wales says he has
been approached by a Mr. Amery, from the
United States, in connection with the open-
ing up of Port Stephens. He will consider
any concrete proposals to that end. What
a reflection it is on Ma State’s Governments!
Sydney is the third for size among the white
cities "of the Empire, and last census showed
it to be growing faster, thanks to the great
loan and congestion policy, than any other
place in George V.’s dominions. Yet, about
70 miles from it, one of the prize harbors of
the Empire, with a great coalfield attached,
is still waiting for any Yankee dollar-hunter
to pick it up.
When George Fuller’s two English experts
arrive to report on .N. S. Wales railways it
is to be hoped they will be asked to say
what they think would have happened if the
railway from London to Liverpool had
stopped at the Peak in Derbyshire, and had
never gone near Liverpool. The question
may suggest something to them, and when
they leave they will possibly say that their
visit has been a liberal education, and that
they never saw quite such a mad place be-
fore.
It is time the N. S. Wales Small Debts
Recovery Act was amended, so far as gar-
nishee orders on wages are concerned. The Act
was framed in 1912, and allowed the gar-
nishee to pay to the judgment debtor .£-
per week of his wages, the balance going
towards satisfaction of the debt. Since then
wages have practically doubled, to the bene-
fit of the creditor, while the price of the
bare necessities of life has risen so that £-
will not keep any debtor’s family for a week.
As a result, if a man has got into debt and his
wages are garnisheed on a couple of pay-
days, he gets further into the mire, and is
forced to go bankrupt. He should be
allowed something more nearly approaching
the basic w T age.
Things are so bad in Freetrade Britain
that the Government has offered to guarantee
a £40,000,000 loan for Argentina, provided
the Argentine Government spends the money
on British goods. In the first eight months
of 1923 foreign countries sold to J. Bull
£123,000,000 worth more than they bought
from him, which was a big difference to
part with. If Bull let go his unflinching
fiscal superstition he could easily tax
£100,000,000 worth of manufactured goods
out of his market, which would be a bigger
profit than anything that can be gained by
backing a Dago’s bill without security.
Greenwood, Eggleston and Farthing are the
most disappointed men in the Vic. Assembly
at having been passed over when the Minis-
try was reconstructed. Greenwood and
Farthing never had a chance, although they
hoped against hope. Eggleston was in the
running, but the ill-judged publicity-stunting
of his friends probably did him no good. He
didn’t even get the “insult” of an honorary
portfolio, such as was offered to Dr. Harris,
M.L.C. —at any rate, Harris thought it was
an insult. There was a titter when the
Speaker announced that he had appointed
Farthing a temporary Chairman of Commit-
tees, in place of Groves (now a whip). It
was like the Yankee President’s alleged gift
of an old pair of boots to a disappointed
aspirant for the ambassadorship to Britain.
From a scene of strife :—■
Bung’s advice to the Queensland elector to vote
“2, 3, X for Continuance and Freedom” would
carry more weight if he didn’t charge Is. 3d. for a
whisky and soda in Brisbane (Is. 9d. in the North),
and 3s. 3d. for a bottle of lager. Brisbane is his
weakest spot, the women being, as always, an uncer-
tain factor; but the bush vote on Oct. 6 will
keep Bananaland safe for the Wets. Nothing has
damaged the Dry campaign more than Theodore’s
8-to-8 ukase; if Continuance is carried it will be
followed by a liberalised Licensing Act providing
for special concessions in *the case of clubs, and
hotels catering for long-distance travellers. Of the
battalion of speakers in action on either side, the
greatest effect has been produced by W. F. Ciasby,
an ex-Digger from the Ma State, who puts the case
for Ticklebrain. A young man with a good plat-
form presence, Ciasby is lucid, fluent and convincing-,
and has a flair for the apposite anecdote.
“Gallery”: Littleton Groom, who is always
being announced as a warm favorite for
some snug position—the latest is the chair-
manship of the Canberra Commission —was
for some days lately the sole representative
of the Government in Melbourne. Nosing
for news in the neighborhood of his depart-
ment, I saw him dash out avith puckered
brow and a bulging attache case from a door-
way down the corridor. To an ancient
usher I remarked that the little fellow’ ap-
peared to be rather excited. “Yes, sir, Mr.
Groom is a little # worried to-day,” the old
chap replied. “Yo*u see lie has been called
upon to be Minister of Defence and Minister
for Home Affairs in two different places at
once—and he doesn’t want to be late.”
The ways of the loan politician are de-
vious. For 20 years or so N.S.W. has shirked
its promise to join its most northern bit of
North Coast railway on to the Queensland
system, lest some trade should go to Bris-
bane. But it doesn’t, apparently, mind the
Commonwealth making the connection, the
hatred of decentralisation being counter-
balanced by the desire to get money to spend.
First it was proposed that the other States
should contribute individually, but both Vic-
toria and S.A. said that rich old Ma should
buy her own railways. So the N.S.W. and
Queensland Ministers are to meet the Fed-
eral man, and discuss what is pompously
called “the scheme,” though it is only a few
miles of ordinary dirt with two ordinary
rails on it. The meeting is to take place at
Canberra, so that politicians may get used
to it. The last is a good idea. Long after
Austin Chapman has sunk into a rich land-
lord’s grave politicians will still be trying
to get used to his pet hamlet —unless they
have given it up as a bad job.
E. ,T. Holloway, the Melbourne Trades
Council sec., now on his way as Labor’s re-
presentative to the Geneva conference, is a
saner Red than the average ranter. He
wants “the revolution,” but also wants some
constructive force at the back of it. His
father died when Holloway was only a child,
and he had to go to work, but he went to
school three nights a week, and has been
i educating himself all his life with such effect
that he is now about the best-read man in
Vic. Labor circles.

The B. H. Prop, has changed out of all re-
cognition in comparatively recent years: its
wonderful old silver-lead mine on the Barrier
is now little more than a side-line. The
book value of mine property and plant there
represents only a corner of a balance-sheet
with a total of more than 7| millions. Prom a
straight-out mining and smelting proposition
the co. has developed into a huge industrial
undertaking, from which it has to find 6 p.c.
on £631,400 of debentures, 7 p.c. on another
lot of £1,435,000, provide sinking funds for
the redemption of both, and earn divs. for
£2,455,048 of capital. The old Proprietary
mine can be expected to add a titbit only
when metal prices and working conditions
favor it.
The published accounts combine the figures
of all operations in a way which prevents the
outsider obtaining any definite information
as to actual results of either the iron-and-
steel or the silver-lead activities. For in-
stance, “sales of products and stocks on hand,
etc.,” are in one entry—£1,663,530; and the
statement of expenditure, though more de-
tailed, is not informative. The figures give
no more than a general view of the results
of all interests. For a start, the following
table shows how gross profits have been de-
rived for the past three years :
1921. 1922. 1923.

ducts and steel

Considering that the steelworks were closed
down for practically nine months of the
year, owing to the eo.’s inability to compete
with the products of foreign furnaces and
mills which had been able to reduce wages
and other costs, and in view of the fact that
no ore whatever was hauled out of the Prop,
mine, the co. did better than might have
been expected. Production at Newcastle for
three years has been as follows: —

The £91,241 received from investments, and
the treatment of old slimes and tailings at
Broken Hill, saved the situation last year.
The Bradford slimes flotation plant put
through 219,320 tons for 20,664 tons lead
concentrates and 49,776 zinc concentrates;
the zinc flotation plant handled 163,382 tons
tails for 23,996 tons zinc concentrates, and
the average price of spelter at £33 4s. 4d.
was up £7 on the previous year. The slime
dumps, however, have now been exhausted,
and only about 60,000 tons of slimes else-
where are available. In the tailings dumps
only a few months’ supply remains.
Nevertheless, one way and another, the
outlook for both ends of the Prop.’s business
appears brighter than it has been for several
years. Despite the competition of cheaper-
labor countries, the steelworks are kept busy
with orders, and the management has suc-
ceeded in reducing costs a little. In one
respect the shut-down was partly a blessing:
it permitted general-manager Essington
Lewis to reorganise portion of the works and
increase their efficiency. Meanwhile the co.
is seeking coal-mines of its own to provide
supplies—it uses up to 800,000 tons per
annum—at bedrock production cost. Next
month it is. proposed to re-commence under-
ground mining at Broken Hill, where visible
reserves of 954,000 tons ore are available for
hauling. The treatment plants there have
undergone considerable alterations to sim-
plify treatment and improve extractions.
The Prop, has paid no div. since August,
1921. Reserves were tapped for £IOO,OOO
in ; the latest accounts so that the usual
provision could be made for depreciation,
but that £IOO,OOO was only a small sip out
of the total accumulation :

stocks, shares in smelters, etc. ..£1,648,348
Liabilities other than debentures .. 598,399
Surplus liquid assets £1,049,949

Henry Berry and Cos. (Australasia) is a hold-
ing concern only, and the published accounts
say very little. Paid capital is £599,640,
made up in this way:—
125,000 fully-paid £1 “A” prefs.
180.640 fully-paid £1 “B” prefs.
294,000 £1 ordinaries fully paid.
There are no outside creditors, and assets
are grouped under three heads:—
1921. 1922 1923
Shares in subsidiaries. . £390,911 £390,911 £390.911
Deposits with subsidiaries 207,139 212,864 222,185
Cash on hand . . . . 31,222 42,420 52,641
No details are given as to the behavior of
subsidiaries, and statements of earnings and
expenditure are restricted to the following
entries: —
1921. 1922 1923
Interest and divs. ..£40,629 £53,378 £63,337
Administration costs . . 300 361 352
Directors’ reports throw no further light on
happenings, excepting brief statements con-
cerning the condition of trade; thus, for the
past, year, “the profit made outside the Com-
monwealth enabled them to show an im-
proved total result.” However, the public’s
interest being restricted to the two lots of
prefs., nothing matters much beyond div.
prospects of these shares and the assets
backing. Even in the first year, when prices
were falling and trade was restricted, the
prefs.’ divs. were earned almost twice over.
Last year the disclosed profit was almost
three times the amount required for the prefs.
The public has some interest in the improved
results, because should the ordinary div. rale
go to 12 p.c. or more, the prefs. are to get
8 p.c. Profits available for ordinaries last
year represented 14 p.c. on their capital,
but the div. rate was only 8} p.c. If the co.
continues to do well, there is a possibility
of prefs. receiving their maximum of 8 p.c.
in years to come.
The security for the pref. capital cannot
be measured in £ s. and. The latest accounts
SSJSLtoto 1 assets of £665,736 to back
±005,640 of pref. scrip, but the actual state
J 1 of the subsidiaries is not disclosed,
and no information is available as to the
amount of goodwill in the £390,911 “shares
in subsidiary cos.” However, there is not
the slightest doubt that the security is first-
class. In three years the backing'has been
further improved by the £30,409 of surplus
profits accumulated, an amount equal to more
than one-sixth of the second prefs.
George Farmer, Ltd., ham and bacon

Those who followed “Teddy” Dyason into
George Farmer, Ltd., have discovered that
Ballarat’s gold-mines are not all underground.
In 1919 the Dyason Pty. underwrote 60,000
8 p.c. £1 cum. prefs. and 27,000 ordinaries
m a float which took over the Farmers’
bacon and ham works which had then been
established almost half-a-century. The old
proprietors took 33,000 fully-paid ordinaries,
27,500 of which were issued against good-
will. The co. has had an exceedingly pros-
perous run, and for the past year the ordi-
naries received two p.c. divs., each accom-
panied, by a shilling bonus, making 25 p.c.
altogether. The profit visible for the 12
months, after deducting the prefs.’ diys.,
equalled p.c. on ordinary capital. The
directors don’t show all that in their pub-
lished Profit and Loss account: the £24,675
they disclose has had £SOOO added in the
introductory table, that amount having been
written off goodwill without remark. A little
more profit may also have been stowed away
by writing down other assets to a greater
extent than actual depreciation required: an
examination of the plant, machinery and
equipment account, which declined almost 20
p.c. on the year, and the expansion of a
taxation reserve from £3250 to £6500, sup-
port the suspicion. On the figures disclosed
since establishment, the present co. has laid
aside £26,632 after having given ordinaries
an average of 15 p.c. p.a. A comparison of
balance-sheet figures presents the co.’s pros-
perity in another way :
1920. 1921. 1922. 1923.

Cash, etc. . . 477 14,269 31,470 51,599
The total of stocks and book debts at .June
30 was much the same as 12 months back,
but in the latest accounts the cash surplus
—that is, the surplus of deposits and cash
over and above liabilities prior to distribut-
ing the final divs. —was £46,102 against
£29,632 a year ago. Of course, the larger
earnings require extra taxation provision;
on the other hand, the management probably
hopes to meet assessments out of prospective
earnings, as it evidently has done in the past.
In all respects the business is very snug.
At the close of the first year an overdraft
was needed to carry the heavy stocks held,
but there was a surplus of liquid assets over
liabilities amounting to £62,353. At June
30 last the surplus exceeded £IOO,OOO. At
that date there were fixed deposits of £34,648
and £16,464 lay at current account; so to
pay for the additions to factory and plant
nowan hand, to enable the co. “to meet any
demands from the trade, provided the neces-
sary supply of pigs is available,” all the
management has to do is to reach for its
cheque-book. The prefs., of course, have ex-
cellent security. After payment of the final
div., the ordinaries were represented by tan-
gible assets with a book value of 17s. 6d.
per £1 paid, compared with approximately
10s. only three years ago.

This woollen co.’s career has been one of
ups and downs. Established with the help
of fairly high protection in pre-Federation
days, it suffered severely under the early
Commonwealth tariffs. Just prior to the
year in which the table opens there had
D6Gn ci long run in which no divs. were paid,
and that had followed a writing-down of
capital by one-half. So old shareholders
weie getting only a little of their own back
when war conditions lifted divs. to appa-
rently almost dizzy heights. Even after the
restoration of £18,750 of the £23,339 of capi-
tal thought to have been lost, the 15 and 20
p.c. divs. did no more than help to fill the
blanks of a comparatively few vears hack
Of course, it was too much To expect the
yery prosperous run during the abnormal
period to continue indefinitely. This shows
how the manufacturing end of the business
has behaved:—

1923 . . 109,978 104,468
During the past 12 months sales fell off
£18,158 with a reduction of only £55 in costs,
but stock-taking showed an increase of
£12.282 of materials and manufactured goods
on hand. Nevertheless, comparatively, it was
a lean year, though that impression was not
given by the directors’ report, which an-
nounced a “balance” of £8951. In that was
included the £1696 carry-forward from the
previous year, and also £l2ll transferred
from a contingency account, the latter having
been the balance of the reservation for war-
time profits which was not required. So, after
taking into calculation an unexplained addition
of £76 to reserves, the actual net profit dis-
closed by the accounts was £6044, and that
was a couple of thousands short of the
amount paid in divs. The profits in the in-
troductory table are those prior to making
provision for depreciation, the amounts so
written off being shown in a separate column.
The behavior of balance-sheet figures is
shown in the following comparisons:—

During the past 12 months paid capital was
increased by £14,113 of new subscriptions
which were invited to pay for mill additions
and to facilitate trading. So far very little
has been visibly added to plant, but the co.
is in a good position to finance any exten-
sions : at June 30 all outside debt amounted
to £4496, and, though stocks were unusually
large, the co. had £7OOO in Government secu-
rities.

The Equitable Life Assurance Cos. of
Queensland, Ltd. —At the outset this little
life co. —another of the many promoted by
ex-officers of the young Australian Provin-
cial Assurance —had to battle to retain its
name-plate: it was taken to court by one of
the old-established Equitables which are no
longer writing policies in the Commonwealth.
The promoters won, the Cos. was registered,
and business commenced as from July 1,
1922. Promoter and managing-director Fred
Levy received 15,000 fully-paid 10s. ordi-
naries, but no cash. The co. is in 400,000
shares, and 210,000, apart from promoters’
scrip, had been applied for up to June 30
last; the public’s shares were called to 55.,
making a total called-capital of £60,000, of
which only £167 was unpaid, though a for-
feited-shares reserve of £76 found a place
in the accounts. The cost of establishment,
opening branches in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, share-selling, etc., swallowed £17,730,
and including the £7500 promoters’ con-
sideration, £25,230 of total paid capital of
£59,833 had become represented by nothing
more tangible than an organisation. Policy-
writing for the year took the total to £30,425,
the excess of outgoings over and above in-
come having been £5196. In business-getting
the Equitable has not been so reckless as
some of its baby competitors. It wrote 1076
policies for £368,788, but re-insured £66,200
(18 p.c.). Net premium income amounted
to £10,115, including £75 of premiums paid
in advance, and expenses charged against it
totted up £16,611. That gives a cost-rate
of 164 p.c. The co.’s auditor places the
rate for new business at 148.3 p.c. The
figures are not excessive first year of
anew co., but the accuracy of the estimates
depends entirely on whether all charges in-
curred in connection with policy-writing were
included and none of them debited directly
against the establishment account. However,
the first year of a life co. is not a reliable
guide to the future: everything depends on
whether premiums over a number of years
can be made to perform the work for which
they were actuarially designed, and that

Anglo-Fersiah Cos. is making fast progress

“cracked” into four dr five marketable com-
modities, and then returned by rail to the

Gnarlbine treated fairish parcels up to 40z.,

When last heard of, Empire Extended
(W.A.), which drew blanks at Hancocks and
elsewhere, and which has since turned down
a lease at Sullivan’s Find, beyond Laverton,
was seeking its fortune near Southern Cross.
The co. is very energetic, but cash is running
too short to embark on extensive mine de-
velopment. Like most other small cos. at
present operating in the West, its features
are cheerful reports followed by calls.

Excitement lately ran high in a Westralian
south-west village when some workmen, mak-
ing railway-station alterations, dug up
liquid quicksilver at a depth of several feet.
An expert came from Perth to scan the pros-
pects and panned off dishes of the pothole
sands. Trial holes were put down in other
parts of the railway yard, but the prospec-
tors were uncommunicative regarding results.
Then an old inhabitant, with a mania for
remembering things, recalled that a decade
or so previously the railway electric staff
battery-wash (the zincs were dipped in
quicksilver) was tipped out monthly where
the “prospect” was mined. The prospectus of
a promising quicksilver mine in W.A. won’t
see type now.
Efforts made to sCcdre the Radio mine
for Melbourne for £40,000 cash have failed.
The two owners propose to plod along and
make about £BOOO each per annum out of the
show. The last yield of 128 oz. ftom 20 tons
was a |hade better than the. usual average.
Prospector Harold Lewis has located sur-
face quartz sfeveh miles from Paynesvdle
(W.A.), and is seeking the source Of his
specimfens. If SUccfessful he is likely to secure
something good, as did prospector Mitchell,
operating only thfee. miles away. At 40tt.
down Mitchell is driving on a 4ft. reet
showing coarse gold freely, and option-
seekers are bidding fot his show.

Whim Wfell Copper (W.A.) has tried
several processes, and is ndw about to give
another its chance. This time it has con-
tracted with the Minerals Separatum Cos. to
install a Perkins plant* which is reckoned to
show good profits, eveti With copper at its
present low price. One of the co.’s scrapped
plants cost £70,000.

After five years’ absence a Bulletin man
recently revisited ottee-prosperous gold-
producing centre of Kookynie (W.A.). All
the old prospectors have gone* and nearly
all the buildings. Except for one mine and a
few tributors the field is defunct.
* * * *
Since 1010 the only Westralian gold-finds
of importance have been the Bullfinch, Edna
May and Radio. The first two have long
been in the list of has-beens, while the Radio,
north of Southern Cross, has so far been
only a small producer, though its prospects
are good. Meanwhile, the Mines Depart-
ment is assisting leaseholders and prospectors
with loans and subsidies, but fresh discoveries
are rare.

Gold extraction per ton at Boulder Perse-
verance has for a long time been double that
on any other mine on the Golden Mile. The
yield for August was £21,000 from 4770
tons. And this was the performance of a
mine which had been turned over to tribu-
tors for several years,

A creep in the south workings of the Lloyd
George (W.A.) must have been much worse
than the official reports disclosed. Indica-
tions are that the gold values and the ore
reserves generally have also crept, otherwise
the worst creep of all, the market stampede,
would not be so pronounced. Only 21,000 con-
ti'ibs. paid to ss. have been issued to date.
These were marketable in Adelaide at 15s.
in June, but sellers nowadays offer them as
low as 3s. on Adelaide account.

Lalla Rookh, Marble Bar (W.A.), expects
to be crushing full-time next month. If re-
sults from the treatment plant confirm the
developmental reports they should be good.
From assay values published there does not
appear to be in mine.
Oroya Links shareholders are officially
advised that the realisable value of the co.'s
liquid assets, apart from ore reserves, etc.,
is now 2s. 3d. per share. For the past five
months working profits have averaged £llOO
per month, and the recent mill
expected to increase them to about £ISOO.
Prospects on the co.’s principal blocks, the
Oroya North and the old Kalgurli, are re-
garded as “promising.” #
Big Ben, near Gundagai (N.S.W.), has
been very reticent since the 10-head battery
started three months ago. Calls of 10s. per
month continue with wearisome monotony,
the stamps apparently declining to drop with-
out their aid. One return of Ssoz. is spoken
of, but nothing official has been reported.
Big Ben has discontinued booming its 35ft
wide lode going lOdwt., and its numerous tri-
butary lodes going Boz. A remarkable leak-
age of values synchronised with the advent
of the battery.

The new Lagoon Creek silver-lead field
in the Cloncurry district (Q.) is absorbing a
fair number of the unemployed copper-miners,
and prospects are sufficiently good to en-
courage the belief that it can take a lot
more. The field, however, is just about one
of the most isolated in that rich mining
district, being 65 miles north-west of Duch-
ess. About 40 men are now making good
wages in surface shows on what appear to
be four distinct lodes, with crops of lead
carbonate and galena rich in silver, assay-
ing in places from 250 to 300 ounces. The
Mt. Ida lode is a big formation on which
the work done so far promises bigger things
than a small syndicate’s prospect.
* * * *
The Empress, Herberton’s only copper-
mine, is outed by the continually declin-
ing price of the metal, which scarcely allows
a profit on even 10 p.c. ore, a figure that
the Empress can pretty well bank on. Prac-
tically all hands have been turned off. but
the manager and a couple of the older miners
will continue looking for richer shoots. In
August 280 tons were sent to Chillagoe.
When A. L. Wilson left Ravenswood
(N.Q.) for Coolon a couple of years back.
it Was thought to be the end of things, but
Jim Duncan has succeeded in extracting
seme ore from the Ravenswood Gold Mines,
which goes to Chillagoe on account of the
heavy zinc, the bugbear of this field. The
reef is small so far, the best stopes averag-
ing only bin., but it has proved persistent
and is considered well worth following up
in view of past experience. Some of the
ore is regular prill, and is being bagged for
the State smelters. At present, 20 to 30
tons are coming out weekly.
One of Irvinebank’s best shows at pre-
sent, the William Morris, has dumped its
supporters. The lode has cut out at 130 ft.,
and the manager has come up to the 60ft.
level and opened out. As for the rest of
the mines, the Vulcan reports better pro-
mise _ at No. 3 level, where ore worth 10
p.c. is being broken.. The last crushing of
50 tons only just about cleared exes, at £6
a ton.
* * * *
The Oaks goldfield (N.Q.) is passing
through a lean period, crushings having
dwindled. Shows like Oaks Consolidated and
Mountain King, which once put through their
400 to 500 tons of low-grade dirt per month,
have declined to 14 and 69 tons respectively
of picked stone for July, and those lots
panned out only loz. and per ton. For
the same month the State Battery put
through only 149 tons in small parcels. Vic-
toria Extended is the one low-grade mine at
present anywhere near the pay-mark. The
cut shows a big face averaging about 4dwt.,
and it’s good for a couple of hundred tons
per month.
* * if *
At Mt. Coolon (Q.), the Native Bear and
the Coolon are each employing about 30 men.
The Sunbeam and Golden Horseshoe find
work for another dozen miners. Various other
shows are being worked on a small scale;
and the Victory, a large reef, is nearing the
end of its exemption. Two 10-head and two
5-head stamp batteries crush stone for their
respective reefs. A public battery would help
towards the development of the field, as small
outside shows have raised stone with no de-
finite prospects of getting it crushed. Though
producing no dazzling specimens, the reefs
are rich in gold, and have great bulk, and on
present indications may live to a good depth.
The gold is rather fine and well distributed.
On the Etheridge (N.Q.) mining and pros-
pecting is quiet. Among the old shows the
Dry Hash, worked by Jack Candlish, is
showing a fairly good reef. The No. 3 west
level is out about 100 ft. from the shaft on
a reef running up to 2ft. and assaying a
couple of ounces of gold. The shoot carries
lead, and the ore is being sent to Chillagoe
for treatment. At Green Hills anew strike
of silver-lead is recorded: 40 tons taken out
near the surface returned 45 p.c. lead and
15oz. silver. Prospects are promising. John-
son and S. Forsayth own the show.

Tassy’s impecunious Government, after
first deciding to spend nothing at all ion
advertising the Speck’s mining industry at
the British Empire Exhibition, and then re-
lenting to the- tune of a whole £BO, has now
loosened the purse-strings to the extent of
£220. The mining cos. are freely offering
bulk ore samples, and a passable lot of
specialties will be staged. The “Giprman-
ston Nugget,” a loewt. block of tin ore
assaying 54 p.c., found at North Dundas
some years ago, will be prominent in the tin
section.
* * * *
Loftus Hills, the Speck’s Government Geo-
logist and Director of the Geological Survey,
has resigned, and will probably find a berth
in South Africa. Hills raised a storm a
couple of years back by unequivocally assert-
ing that liquid oil never would nor oould be
found in Tassy, despite opinions of outside
oil-men. On Hills’s advice Mines Minister
Elliott Lewis turned down the Adelaide Oil
Exploration Co.’s proposal to lease a big
area of the island. Lewis’s successor, Ernie
Blyth, and Hills have not hit it. That and
the restricted field offering in little Tas-
mania resulted in the resignation.
Briseis (Tas.) is beginning to get back
some of the cash put into the diversion of
the Ringarooma River. From between 50,000
and 60,000 c. yd. of drift Lindesay Clark
is winning about 35 tons of black tin per
month. Operations are now in tin-bearing
drift 220 ft. deep, the lowest part of the work-
ings being 135 ft. below the level of the
diverted river. The bottom 150 ft. of the drift
averages 21b., and the upper 70ft. 0.61 b. For
1200 ft. ahead tunnels and bores have proved
the lead to be of average value, so there
should be years of profitable work in sight.
Briseis talks in big figures. Its record to date
has been : Overburden removed, 5,333,400 c.
yd. ; drift treated, 8,447,200 ,c. yd. ; black
tin won. 12 074 tons ; value, £1,512,000 ; divs.
paid, £502.500.

Nawng Pet, the Siamese tin-show intro-
duced to Sydney by Arthur King, is out with
accounts showing how it wriggled clear of the
tight financial corner in which it was squeezed
at the beginning of last year, when creditors
went so far as to seek its liquidation. For
the 11 months to March 31 last 240a tons
tin, fetching £25.634, were won at a mining
cost of £8590. The 313,773 c. yd. averaged
19d., and costs ran out at 6id. The net- pro-
fit, after writing off preliminary exes., paying
legal exes., interest on outstanding accounts,
etc., was £7000, and that and the issue of
39,000 reserve shares at par enabled the
directors to pay off all outside debt and spend
about £8000 on a second dam and on new
plant. The only debits left in the accounts
were loans by directors, which are free >of
interest, and Board fees. The rainy season
is almost due, and after the water-supply is
replenished Nawng Pet hopes to go full-steam
ahead.

“Smike”: Probably the German corpse-
factorv yarn began with a discovery near
Bellicourt. The canal there runs for some
distance through a tunnel. An exploring
Tommy, accompanied by an Aussie, ventured
into the darkness one day with an electric
torch. A few feet from the entrance they
came to a small door, and on pushing it open
found a flight of steps leading to gloom
above. They mounted the stairs to a large
apartment, and in the light from a hole
showing a patch of sky aloft they saw that
a big shell had played tricks with the in-
terior. There were 10 corpses, and the trunk
and head of one of them had been hurled
into a large dixie half-full of something that
was slowly stewing over a fire. Others after-
wards saw the gruesome mess, and the yarn
filtered down from the front to the back,
growing more hideous and bloated at each
stage of the journey, until it attained the
dimensions of a national undertaking and
provided the fuel for another Hate. But I
never met a soldier who believed the slander,
though it was readily swallowed by many
civilians. It was, by the way, an officer
whose home address was The Buli.etin Office
who took Bean, the historian of the war, to
see the cook-shop, and laugh with him over
the weird story that had just begun to cir-
calculate; but as far as I know he has never
written a line about it.
“Chant Pagan”: In Billmasseyland an
argument has arisen as to whether it is 98
or 100 years since the first Maori was bap-
tised; but Henare still seems to apply a
higher criticism of his own to certain Bibli-
cal teachings. For instance, yesterday I
foregathered with an old Maori that I had
not seen for years, and we had a great
korero. Among other things he related the
latest scandal in the pah. I asked who was
the father, and he said: “Don’ know. Te
wahine no tell. On’y one ferra know —Atua ’
(pointing upward).
“Fa’a-fua”: The Hun is a
great propagandist, and he’s
at it in Samoa —not publicly
suggesting anything himself,
but inducing others to do it.
For instance, the local paper
was inveigled lately into sug-
gesting that the former Ger-
man managers should be
reinstated in order to “save
the plantations from total
ruin.” As a matter of fact,
the Huns who remained in
Samoa, mostly because they
decided to marry their
former native concubines and
were retained on the planta-
tions, are more helpless than
the British employees, as the
former only understood Hun
methods of working labor,
and now that corporal pun-
ishment is tabu they are un-
able to get even a fair
amount of work from the
coolies. The Huns certainly
made good profits from their
copra plantations before the
war, and so they should.
Their labor was exception-
ally cheap, and labor wages
were paid in money specially
made for the firms employ-
ing the labor and only nego-
tiable by those firms, so a
profit was made both ways—
out of the work done by the
labor and again on the goods
passed over the counter in
exchange for the so-called
money. Even then, with
everything in its favor, the
wealthiest concern in Samoa
paid a dividend of 38 per
cent, in its best year, which
appears to me to be dash bad
management. I know of a
British sugar concern which
could have paid a far greater
dividend any year it liked
in pre-war days, with far worse conditions.
* * * *
“Sammas”: A simple-looking individual
with a nasal twang recently “put one over”
an exceptionally hard-headed moneylender in
an Australian capital. The Yank offered
the financier, who will seldom look at any
but gilt-edged securities, a number of Ameri-
can war bonds, and got an advance of £2OO,
about half their nominal value. The bonds
were not redeemed, and in due course were
sent to the IJ.S. Treasury for conversion.
The reply that came back was that the bonds
were stolen property, and had been confis-
cated and returned to their rightful owner.
Shylock accepted his loss as philosophically
as he could—until he received a polite note
from the gentleman he had accommodated,
mentioning that lie himself had reported the
theft of the bonds to the Treasury, enjoyed
a pleasant holiday in Australia, and re-
turned home to find his securities awaiting
RIGHT.
“What would you do if you had a thousand a year?”
“My Hock”
him. The note concluded with the pious
hope that the friendly relations between the
two great English-speaking countries would
not be affected by the incident.
“D.”: The Australian who gets into a
street row prides himself on not using a
knife. H e “leaves that to Dagoes.” Now, a
knife, if it misses a vital spot, makes a nice
clean wound which quickly heals. Judging
by the police-court reports, the most popular
Australian weapon of offence is the beer-
bottle. A bottle is as potent to kill as a
knife—and as it is always directed at the
victim’s head it often does kill —while the
after-effects, when death does not ensue, may
bo terrible. “I gave him a headache for
life” is a phrase sometimes used by push-
ites in reference to an enemy who has been
outed, though not slain, by the agency of a
glassware sandbag. A terrible truth lurks
in this boast. One who is hit in the right
place by a bottle will often suffer the tor-
tures of Hell till his death. Outside casual
fights and underworld vendettas, the bottle
is chiefly employed on wives or women who
are living with men, and on policemen. This
report from the Argus last week is typical:
In the City Court yesterday, John Marsden, aged
32 years, farm laborer, was charged with having
assaulted Marie Lorenzo. Marsden attacked her and
said: “If vou do not give me that money out of
your stocking, I will hit you with a bottle.” She
said, “You need not slay me like that.” Marsden
tore the money from her stocking, and struck her
on the head and the eye with a bottle.
For this Marsden got a month: it should
have been IS. The bottle-wielder of Sydney
and Melbourne —the “night-hawk,” as Judge
Scholes, of the former city, recently described
him—is the lineal descendant of the garrot-
ter of 19th-century London. The garrotters
were only persuaded to change their ways
when Justice Hawkins and others began to
prescribe the lash.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: Australia’s first gold coins
were struck in South Australia. When
Ballarat and Bendigo were at the height
of their glory gold-diggers swarmed into Vic-
toria from the Adelaide side; at one time
they were •crossing the Murray at the rate
of over 100 a day. To make the best of what
seemed rather a bad job, the S.A. Govern-
ment encouraged the diggers to send their
gold back to Adelaide. An assay office was
opened, which started by stamping the weight
and value on the pieces of gold. Then, in Febru-
ary, 1552, the central colony began to issue
gold coins, quite without legal sanction.
Only sovereigns were actually coined, though
dies were struck for £2 and £5 pieces. Up
till February, 1853, when operations were
stopped, 24,648 sovereigns were issued. They
were heavier than the normal sovereign, and
actually worth £1 Is. lid. each. They are
now worth £lO or more. Some years ago be-
tween 400 and 500 of them were found in
the vaults of the Bank of Australasia in
Adelaide. Distinguished visitors used some-
times to be given a specimen. The Sydney
branch of the Roval Mint was not opened
till 1855, so that Adelaide got in three years
ahead.

“S.T.S.”: Does anybody know when the
demand “Hands up !” and the action itself
as a sign of surrender became general?
American film-merchants are using it now
in 18th-century plays, which doubtless is
absurd. There can’t have been much point in
one armed man ordering another into this
attitude till the possibility arose of the second
man carrying a weapon small enough to be
concealed and capable of being fired
elaborate preparation—say the “Colt” of the
eighteen-sixties. The first use of the term

OLD LADY (after listening to ragtime ) :
“Dm, yes, very nice. But can you play

as a symbol seems to have been in the Boer
War, when the Dutch farmers invented the
name “hands-uppers” for those among them
who were thought more willing to surrender
than to fight.

THE HOURSES OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“A loose box for the Aquitania is being constructed
with lined air-cushions and undyed natural hides,
and in order to allow the horses to converse there
will be an opening between Papyrus s, and Bar Bold s
boxes. Three stable-boys familiar with the horses
will travel on the Aquitania, but in case they should
be seasick a fourth boy well used to Atlantic tia>el
also goes.”— Cable.
A cheer for the horses of war,
From the farm and the •plain;
From the hills that will know them no more
Mooching on in the rain :
A cheer for the horses of war,
Sleeping on with the slain!
They travelled twenty thousand miles and more across
the sea,
On decks that stank with odors rank and things that
sickened me;
They sweltered in the tropic heat that scorched them
in the hold ;
They bruised their sides and tore their hides and
shivered in the cold.
No pampered, padded thoroughbreds, no equine swells
were they ;
But God! they showed the debt they owed to Bourke
and Lachlan way.
Of days of drought and dust and heat, and droving
on the plain,
No doubt they spoke and cracked a joke, and lived
them all again.
Excuse me if I smile at these poor slender shiny
things
That must be dressed and eat the best because they
race for kings !
Excuse me, for I’m thinking of a hell called Palestine,
Of days of thirst and desert curst and men who
envied swine!

early bird ! catches the worm, you know.”
A NNE: “But I’m sure none of the nice boys will be
down yet.”
M ARY: “Never mind, we’ll catch a few worms for bait.”
And though vve left our horses there, among the
mates who died,
To starve and rot and be forgot along the Jordan
side,
On western track and further back, and here in the
Domain,
The men who knew what they could do oft think
of them again.
And some there are —God help them all! —who live
those days again,
Through twisted limbs and sight that dims and
broken, feeble brain,
Who, wishing they were Jordan way, deep buried
with the slain,
Still find a cheer above their fear, a cheer above
their pain:
A cheer for the horses of war,
From the farm and the plain;
From the hills that will see them no more
Mooching on in the rain:

THE FAMOUS
RED PACKET
“Gadoitcha” : In the N.T. it is an offence
to supply natives with alcoholic liquor, but
at Darwin a suspicion has been developing
for some time that houseboys, with a few
week-end shillings to spend, were getting
more uplift out of locally-made hop-beer at
6d. a bottle than a white man could obtain
from the genuine article at 2s. 3d. Finally,
the authorities purchased samples of the
beverage, which, when vivisected, turned out
to be “cheeky feller” to the extent of over
5 p.c. proof spirit. Two hop-beer magnates
were consequently prosecuted under the S.A.
Licensing Act, which applies to the Terri-
tory, and were awarded six months each with-
out the option. This is the minimum sen-
tence for such an offence north of the 15th
parallel, though south of this Rubicon a
magistrate can impose a fine or order im-
prisonment for four months. To round off the
joke, the sentences were quashed on an appeal
to the Supreme Court, on the grounds that
proof had not been adduced that Darwin is
north of the 15th parallel!

“P.X.”: A cable tells of a shocking thing
which has happened in connection with the
latest “revolution” in Spain. Following on
a prqclamation ordering civil servants to be
on duty in the public offices by 9 o’clock,
2000 officials who had not been seen on the
premises before scrambled in—hitherto they

had never turned up, but had paid messen-
gers to collect their salaries. It reminds
me of the first lesson I got in Spanish eti-
quette. There was a considerable crowd
present, and I was under the wing of an
old officer of the British diplomatic service.
He pointed out various men. Then I asked
a question about one: “What does he do?”
“Ah, never ask that in Spain,” he
said. “It isn’t allowable. You see, it im-
plies that the person does sometning—really
works for his living. And, though he may

for months.”
have to do it, he pretends he doesn’t, and
you must pretend that such a shameful sus-
picion never entered your head.”
“F.A.” delves into synagogue history:—
If the Jewish headquarters are re-
moved from their present location (B.
6/9/’23), it will be the fourth shift
undergone by the Beth-Tephiloh since
the first Hebrew sanctuary was set
up in Sydney in 1817. In that year
the Jewish community numbered 20
all told, but they formed themselves
into a society, and three years later
obtained a grant from Dr. Cowper,
the then senior Christian prelate, of
a part of the George-street cemetery.
Not only were the Jewish dead buried
there, but a primitive structure for
worship was erected on the spot. In
1828 there was a large influx of the
faith, including many of the forebears
of Sydney’s present merchant princes,
and services began to be conducted
in P. J. Cohen’s York-street home,
though a small faction segregated
itself and hired a room in George-
street. Two years later the Rev.
Aaron Levi, representative of the Chief
Rabbi .in England, arrived, his bag-
gage bulging with the Seephor-Torah
(Jewish Law) and Hebrew prayer-
books. The next move came in 1832,
when J. B. Montefiore, then president
of the society, leased a storeroom on
the Quay side of Bridge-street to bis
Jewish co-religionists. Here, by the
way, the first Jewish marriage was
solemnised. (Birts’ tall pile now
occupies the site.) The Chosen in-
creased with such rapidity that in
1841 a Druitt-street block was pur-
chased for £3600. The pretentious
edifice erected on this spot was form-
ally opened on April 2, 1844, the
ceremony being conduced by the Rev.
M. Rentel, Australia’s first rabbi. At
this period there were about a thou-
sand Jews in the colony, though only
half of them lived in Sydney. For
30 years the Druitt-street synagogue
fulfilled requirements, but in 1875,
with 3000 of the Chosen to back him
up, Saul Samuel (afterwards Agent-
General) laid the foundation-stone of
the Elizabeth-street sanctuary, and
three years later service was conducted
there.
“George Rich”: Close shaves? A railway
employee at York (W.A.) got his foot caught
in the points. A train bore down on him
as he desperately struggled for freedom, and
the wheel of the locomotive, catching his
boot, dragged it off. . The man came out of
it all without a scratch.
“Baro”: “X2X” (B. 6/9/’23) quotes an
American anthropometrical society to support
the theory, which isn’t a new one, that the
physical characteristics of Americans have
much in common with those of the Red
Indian, the ap-
proximation being
more marked in
the purer strains
of the whites.
Nevertheless the
environment of the
modern American
is very different
from that of the In-
dian of, say, two
centuries ago. The
only thing that
hasn’t altered is
the climate. And
if climate alone can
effect such changes,
how is it that the
negroes, a pur e
race, do not tend
towards the Indian
type? So far from
showing any
change, they re-
main indistinguish-
able from their
African brothers.
As for the sugges-
tion that the Aus-
tralian may re-
semble the aborigi-
nal in the future,
he seems to be
already developing
a type of quite a
different sort. This
was very quickly
discerned by Euro-
peans during the
war; he was fre-
quently described
as being hatchet-
faced, with a high,
narrow and often
aquiline nose and
rather thin lips.
The Australian
black, per contra,
has a very broad
nose and thick, flabby lips. That environ-
ment does affect the living organism must
be conceded; but the known effects so far
present insufficient data on which to build
theories.
* * * *
“Sturt”: The 250-odd “literary institutes”
of S.A. held their annual conference in Adel-
aide during Show Week. A council of 10 in
the city, half elected by the institutes, half
appointed by the Government, watches over
their interests, though each
institute manages its own
affairs; ; and they elect three
members to the Board which-
runs the State’s Art Gallery,
Public Library and Museum.
Every September they send
delegates to the conference,
which carries out the said
electing, listens to an address
from the Minister of Educa-
tion, and discusses any points
brought up by the country
bodies, from Oodnndatta to
Mount Gambier. The Coun-
cil maintains a strong refer-
ence library which can be
drawn on at will, sends
around boxes of 60 books (no
fiction included), which move
on every three months, and
lately has done some advan-
tageous wholesale buying at
the request of the scattered
bodies. Also it runs a monthly
Institute Journal, which
keeps the whole lot in touch.
South Aus. considers its sys-
tem of carrying the seeds of
culture into country places
easily the best in Australia;
and the Government subsi-
dises (15s. in the £) the sub-
scriptions raised in each township.
“Ex-Bettor”: What beats me is why those
who draw horses in Tatt.’s “consultations”
and approach or are approached by owners
pay up when the animals win or are placed.
They are under no legal obligation to do so.
If an owner had the effrontery to ask a
Court for a third or half of a prize in respect
of a Tatt.’s ticket to the purchase of which
he had contributed nothing, he would remain
in the precincts only until the Judge blew
him out. No question of business honor
enters into the thing. If a blackmailer holds,
a pistol to my head while I write him a
cheque, who will say that I am not entitled
to stop the promise to pay at the earliest
opportunity? One of the reasons why some
men pay bookmakers, even when satisfied
that there has been dirty work, is that they
are anxious to do further business with the
Ring. But no one can be posted at Tatt.’s,
and an owner who complained publicly of
being bilked of a sum of money to which, in
equity, he was never entitled, would attract
more derision than sympathy. Despite all
these obvious considerations, Tatt.’s sweep-
winners keep trotting along, after the event,
with “presents” running into thousands of
pounds sterling for owners and stables. Why
do they do it?
“Wilfrido” : A number of fowls of a valu-
able strain were shipped from Sydney to
Wellington (M.L.), and for services ren-
dered them during the voyage they showed
their gratitude in the usual manner. Fol-
lowing a custom of the sea, the eggs were
claimed by the cook as his perquisite, and
he sold them to a fireman who carried on
poultry-farming as a side-line. Had the pro-
geny been commonplace chooks nothing more
would probably have been heard of the mat-
ter ; but the brood were aristocrats to the
clawtips, and began to carry off prizes when
exhibited. By some means the owner of the
travelling fowls discovered the origin of the
pot-hunting orphans, and in his heat he
threatened to charge the fireman-fancier with
theft; finally, recognising that no criminal
offence had been committed, he resolved to
take civil proceedings. The case was one
that fairly bristled with legal points, and the
wigs on both sides were laden with autho-
rities when Fate interposed. It took the
form of a couple of stoats which raided the
hen-roost and mangled the . pedigree birds be-
yond possibility of identification.

“There’s one consolation,’’ said a girl, talk-
ing to a Sydney evening paper of the threat-
ened shortage in the Japanese silk supply:
“I’ve still got a couple of good silk slips
which will help out my muslin frocks.”
Not all is lost; though kingdoms rock,
Thanks yet will rise from tender lips;
Though cities die in mortal shock,
Our Susie has two silken slips.
* ** * *
“Ex-Dig.” : The case of a one-legged Digger
at Geelong with unclaimed pension money
amounting to £6OO is being quoted as remark-
able. But it is far from unique. I know
two ex-A.I.F. men in Sydney who have never
pocketed a penny of tlie money allowed them
in Compensation for war injuries. Certainly
it is drawn, but it goes regularly every fort-
night to societies working on behalf of ex-
soldiers who are less well-off. A lot of money
remains not only uncollected but unasked
about. Many gratuity bonds are still awaiting
applicants who have mysteriously disappeared ;
and even some deferred pay has never yet
been claimed. ' In some cases it may be due
to patriotism ; in most I suspect it is just
Billjim’s old casual way.

"Why, I heard she died and left him disconsolate.”

“F.A.”: I can tell “Spotlight” (B
13/9/’23) of two Australian residents be-
sides his negress who came into close contact
with “the little Corporal” at St. Helena.
Colonel OLDER-
SHAW, ex-Sugar
Controller, who is
figuring largely in
the Royal Com-
mission's inquiry
in Melbourne.
These were the
Misses Balcombe,
who were residents
of the isle, while
their father occu-
pied an lofficial post
in connection with
A . Bonaparte’s de-
tention. Both ladies
lived for many
years in Sydney;
one of them, who
married the late
Dr. Taylor, of
Woollahra, is still
alive, I believe.
One of the ladies
used to tell how, as
a child, she in-
curred “Boney’s”
displeasure by pre-
senting his swiord
at him and remark-
ing that she now
had him at her
mercy.
George Noble, the under-manager, stands
out conspicuously among the heroes of the Bell-
bird disaster. Although they started as boys
in the days when he was young, his 53 years
of coalmining makes him an old man ; yet ho
plunged into the treacherous dangers of the
mine in an endeavor to effect rescues, ordered
a younger man to stay while he explored a par-
ticularly bad part, and kept at it until he
collapsed and had to be carried out. Then
the only thing he thought of was to gasp out
information about the lay of the fire which
he had ascertained from his exploration.
Governors whose bones remain in Australia
are Collins and Wilmot (Tas.), Duff and
Davidson (N.S.W.), Blackall and Musgrave
(Q.), Dominick Daly (S.A.) and Charles
Hotham (Vic.).
The end of a great career:—
It seems odd to the present generation, which only
knows John Morley by his masterly biographies,
that 45 years ago he should have been best known
to a large body of reputable people as a thoroughly
dangerous character, in his brilliant youth he was
something of a crank —an advanced Radical, and a
rationalist whose impeccable life set many a noisy
Christian to shame. He left Lincoln College, Oxford,
for the London Bar and journalism, and was the
greatest editor the Fortnightly, ever had. In ISB3
he was elected for Newcastle-on-Tyne as a Liberal,
and soon justified the worst fears of those who had
known him at the Oxford Union by disclosing himself
as an uncompromising Irish Nationalist, He did
better work for the Home Rule movement than
Gladstone himself, being ever ready to go in advance
of the public feeling of his period. It was on account of
this trait that he turned eventually from that strangely
conservative Liberal, Lord Rosebery, and followed
the Harcourt banner. His wise counsels were largely
responsible for the South African settlement which
the Campbell Bannerman Cabinet effected in the
teeth of a storm of Tory abuse. He was again a
Minister under Asquith in 1908, but his vigor was
now failing. He had given up his London home and
settled at Wimbledon not far from Swinburne and
Watts. Here he wrote his “Recollections” and re-
ceived his admirers, who included practically every-
one of literary importance in Europe. He was one
of the first to be made an O.M. —about the only
civilian order that cannot be bought nowadays—
and he held honorary degrees of all the great British
universities. A kindly and most human man, with
a face typical of the best sort of ecclesiastic, he
might have made an ideal Bishop of London had
he possessed the gift of faith. His marriages were
a failure, and he left no heir to the viscountcy with
which he was raised to the Lords in 1908. He was
born on Christmas Eve 85 years ago.
Leslie Bradford, the new manager of the
Broken Hill Prop, steelworks at Newcastle
(N.S.W.), is a product of Australians educa-
tional system. Born at Delhi (India) 42
years ago, he finished his primary studies in
Adelaide, then passed through the School of
Mines there with distinction. After entering
the 8.11. P. service he thought the space on
top rather limited, so he went into the steel-
casting business with another of like mind;
but when Baker, of Boston, resigned from
the managership the B.H.P. directors beck-
oned Bradford back, and now he runs the
big works. He has many inventions and inno-
vations to his credit, the best known being
his mineral-flotation process.
“Skyrider”: Nothing did more to popu-
larise Governor Davidson among the country
people than his habit of getting among the
sheep and cattle at a show after he had
“opened” it, and yarning to the exhibitors
and onlookers. At one southern A., P. and
H. outing, having given the local Pure
Merinoes the slip, he was discussing long-
wools with a whiskery mob, when an argu-
ment arose over a ram. Sir Walter gave
his opinion. An old farmer looked at him
disparagingly. “What the do you know
about it?” he asked. “Some of you city
chaps couldn’t tell a comeback from a
crossbred, but you come along to a show
and talk as if you had been raising sheep
all your life. What’s your name, anyway:’
“Davidson.” “By gosh, I beg your pardon.
The Davidsons ought to know something
about sheep. 1 knew your old man when he
first took up land in this district. Come
and have a drink.” When the Mayor found
his distinguished visitor breasting the bar
in the booth with his new friend he was hor-
rified. “Come along, Sir Walter,” he said,
“I have the car ready for you.” “Cripes!” re-
marked old Corriedale. And now he is
proudly showing his friends the tumbler
which he shook from the bar.
After nearly four years of legal palavering
in Maoriland, the handsome bequest that Dr.
Edith Ara Huntley left for midwifery pur-
poses has been allocated to the Alexandra
Home for Women. The testator was a
staunch believer in what is known to the
profession as “twilight sleep,” and she left
approximately £B5OO for the endowment of
an institution for the care and treatment of
expectant mothers, research work into the
means of alleviating the conditions of mother-
hood and the training of pupils in midwifery.
Dr. Huntley was a bluff, rather masculine
type of woman whose heart was pure gold.
She was never known to refuse a genuine
application from a poor person for help or
treatment; and, with her three huge St.
Bernard dogs, she was a familiar figure in
the poorer quarters of the Capital City.
Vic.’s Lieut.-Gov. Irvine is going for a
trip to the Cold Land next year. He has
been C.J. for little more than five years, and
was GO when appointed. It is nearly 20
years—after relinquishing the Premiership
owing to ill-health—since he paid his last
visit to England and Ireland. That was
when Trinity College, Dublin, made him an
honorary doctor of laws—a distinction he
never paraded. Ulster should give him a
warm welcome, as he hails from Kilevy, near
Newry, and the greeting won’t be one-sided,
as he is a nephew of John Mitchel, who suf-
fered for Iris Free Ireland views. Bucking-
ham Palace will have a G.C.M.G. ready when
ho drops in.
“0.K.”: Died in Melbourne the other day,
at 54, J. L. Wharton, who as long ago as
1899 was a well-known mining secretary,
figuring in Alf Vincent’s picture of Mel-
bourne Block identities. Of the 46 people
in that array of portraits only about eight
are still on earth, four of them being placed
together in the lower row of pedestrians. A
terrible lot of young, middle-aged and elderly
people fail to live 24 years after being
sketched. In this case the artist himself
died on the right side of 40.
T. S. HAWKES, father of tennis-player J. B.
Hatches; he was hilled in the Japanese
earthquake.
“Biltong”: Old-timers out Bourke way
have plenty of yarns about the late “Ba,ldy”
Davis; but the one that sets me chuckling
most is of the old hard case’s first appear-
ance on the Bench as a Jay Pay. He solemnly
lowered himself into the judicial chair; then,
pointing in turn to the witness-box and the
dock, he said, with a comically exaggerated
sigh of satisfaction: “Well, I’ve been there;
and I’ve been there, and now —— I’m
herb !”
William Wiley, chief Sydney municipal
assessor, who passed out the other day at
71, was the son of a basket-maker in Park-
street, who advertised his wares as Phil
McCarroll did his meat, in rhyme. In the
’seventies William Wiley was a clerk in the
Lands Department, and in his spare time
Town Clerk of Waverley. Then he launched
out in real-estate business; later still he be-
came city valuator, and is understood to
have given satisfaction even to ratepayers.
Digger Alan Cobcroft, who recently sailed
from Samoa to report on the Australian Gov-
ernment properties in New Guinea, is the
young man who played full-back for New-
town (Sydney) in the old Rugby Union days.
He has had extensive plantation experience,
and is manager of the biggest cocoanut plan-
tation in Samoa—until 1914 owned by the
Huns. The M.L. Government has lent him
for a month or two, and he will return to
his job after he has summed up New Guinea.
Passed out in Melbourne, as the result of
an accident, J. A. Forrest, the first Cen-
tral or Western Bananalander to become a
Doctor of Medicine. Born in Rockhampton
he was educated at St. Stanislaus’ College,
Bathurst, and the Rockhampton and Bris-
bane Grammar Schools. Winning an exhibi-
tion scholarship when 18, he went to Edin-
burgh, where he won another and completed
his course before he was 24. He practised
at Mt. Morgan for a time, and was Govern-
ment Medical-officer at Charters Towers for
33 years.
“Nollig”: The long arm again. Years ago,
when T. J. Bakhap resigned his seat in the
Speck’s Assembly to fight for Federal honors,
Hayes was elected in his place. Now Hayes
goes to the Senate to fill the void created by
Bakhap’s higher call.
The suspension of <4. W. Smith, the
Speck’s Railway Commissioner, recalls the
similar treatment of Speight, Ford and
Greene by the Shiels (Yic.) Ministry in
March, 1892. The decision was boldly an-
nounced by the late lamented Evening
Standard as soon as it was arrived at by
Cabinet, but the other four papers (the
Telegraph was then in existence) held off
till the Order-in-Council was passed in the
middle of the following week. Speight got
a fair lump (about two years’ pay) in com-
pensation, and the other two were pacified
somehow. Speight, after losing two suits
against the Age, went to Westralia. Pea-
cock, Minister for Education, and A. R.
Outtrim (now in retirement at Maryborough)
are the only survivors of the Ministry which
broke up the railway triumvirate; Speight,
Ford and Greene themselves have all gone.
Tom Hawkes set : out from Geelong the
other day to meet his widowed mother
at Manila—her husband and their friend
Mr. Keays were buried under the ruins of
the Yokohama Hotel, where they had put up
after landing. Mrs. Hawkes escaped through
a window, and put in some ghastly hours in
the sea as a refuge from the threatening
furnace of the burning city, and then made
a nightmare journey with thousands of others
to the safety of far-away Kobe.
Jumping at conclusions, the Age made Sam
Barnes, ex-Minister for Mines, Agent-General
for Vic, for a few hours, and then Lawson
blew out the scoop. All that the Syme organ
had to work on was that Barnes had taken
his passage for England. It is not everybody
who has the luck of Delane, of the Times,
who happened to be correct when he deduced
from a conversation with a doctor about the
climate of India that a peer-patient of his
was going there as Gov.-General.
At a recent meeting of veterans little Lewis
Cohen, Adelaide’s long-distance Mayor,
paraded his military experience. He was a
private in the N.S.W. forces in 1868 when
the attempt was made to assassinate the Duke
of Edinburgh. “Martial law was proclaimed
in Sydney,” he explained, “all members of the
defence forces were called to arms, and for
10 days we were on duty guarding the public
buildings and so on. That was my period
of active service. Not a shot was fired, but.”
he added with an extra twinkle, “you will
see that I have served my country as a
soldier.”
Loftus Hills, who has been with Dyett
representing the Australian Diggers at the
Imperial Conference, returned only to resign
his position as director of Tas. Geological
Survey. It was thought he would look for
a new job while he was away: he is not
optimistic about the oil prospects of the
Speck, and though maybe his attitude has
saved investors a pot of money, it has made
him unpopular with a lot of people, the late
Minister of Alines among them. He has the
choice of two positions, one in S’Africa and
one in Queensland. Hills is numbered among
Launceston’s smart boys—he passed his

The Big War is still claiming its victims.
At the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney,
after-effects of service brought death to
'Captain R. N. Cadden the other day. Cadden
served in the Boer War with the Light Horse,
and he joined up with the mounted infantry
again when the Kaiser broke loose. He was
on Gallipoli for a while, and later went to
Mesopotamia—which may have a blessed
name but certainly has a cursed climate.

AN EXTINCT TYPE.

“An outstanding feature of the Adelaide Show was
the disappearance of the beard among tillers of the
soil.” — S.A. Chronicle.
“Where are the snows of yesteryear?”
Where are the skirts that used to flow
Down to the ankles or somewhere near
In days before it was comme il fa-ut
For Gladys most of her calves to show ?
Where is the quantum suff. of scran
That once you bought for a shilling or so?
And where is the whiskered husbandman ?
Where are the shining coins and clear
In sovereign purses a man could stow?
Where is the kick that a pint of beer
Held but a decade or less ago
In the Bull and Mouth or the Barley Mow
Ere the war-gong beat and the nations ran
Hotfoot to the slaughter? Nobody know?
But where is the hirsute husbandman?
Hadn’t you noticed him disappear,
Shuffling over the skyline slow?
Brothers, ’twere meet we drop a tear
Now he’s in the pack where the discards go,
The gent with the mutton chops and mo
That round his dial like creepers ran
And fell in waves o’er the chest below
The chin of the bearded husbandman.

Where does the aurochs snort and blow?
Where is the plesiosaurus clan ?
Answer me, artists! Bards, what ho!
Where is our whiskered husbandman?

“Numbugga”: “Gregor” (B. 6/9/’23) and
the unspeakable pleasantries of the niggers up north
serve to recall a Gulf Country tragedy of the early
’nineties. The blacks captured a trooper, and after
stripping him suspended him head-down from a
sapling-top well curled over, so that his face was
within a foot of a nest of flesh-eating ants. From
the antheap sticks were secured to the head of the
victim, so that the ants might eat him gently, head
and face first, at leisure. And to make sure that
the ants got a free run, the hands of the trooper were
lashed to his sides.
THE WAY OF IT.
LAWYER: “And, now, sir, kindly describe to the Court how the stairs
run in that house?”
WITNESS (after consideration): “Veil, van I am oopstairs they run
down, and van I am downstairs they run oop”
“D.F.” : Like other crude and discredited
notions the theory of telegony bobs up all over the
place. Heaps of people believe that both in beasts
and in man the influence of a sire persists when the
female is bred to another male of a different variety.
Thus it has long been believed that if a black woman
has a child by a white man and then another by a
black man, the second child is influenced by the
white father of the first. But Dr. Cossar Ewart,
professor of natural history at Edinburgh and one
of the world’s big authorities on the breeding and
crossing of animals, says that there is no scientific
ground for the idea. Lord Morton went strongly for
the theory on the strength of some stripes on the
foals of an Arab mare which had once been mated
with a quagga. But Ewart says that the stripes
were not more marked than those that often appear
on normal foals. He himself crossed a number of
ponies first with pure-bred sires and then with Bur-
chell’s zebra and vice versa —and the theory never
worked out. Later he experimented with dogs and
sheep, and came to the conclusion that telegony
is all moonshine. But he hasn’t convinced the
telegonists.
“Borom” : I’d often wondered whence came
the term “bull’s wool,” now generally a derisive
personal remark. Glancing through a book published
in Melbourne in the early ’sixties, I came across the
appellation there, with a note to the effect that
the Victorian settlers applied it to the fibre of
stringy-bark, which they used for a variety of
purposes, ranging from stuffing for cushions and pil-
lows—they could have been soft ones—to
roofing. In the latter case, they shredded and
chopped up the stuff as finely as possible, then
wetted and pressed it. However, it soon deteriorated
and disintegrated and was generally discarded in
favor of sheet-bark removed whole from green
trees.
“Baldy”: Here’s my entry for the sound-
sleeping stakes. While riding home on horseback
from a dance at 3 o’clock in the morning (the third
for the week) I mounted my horse after closing the
gate on the back of Mt. Kuroora run (Vic.). I
knew no more until I fell forward on the nag’s
neck when it stopped at the front gate on the
other side of the run, a distance of eight miles
between gates.
“Pounamoa”: We Maorilanders have the
highest regard for you Australians and all that sort
of thing, but when it comes to souvenirs of this
sort Some men working the transmission line
between Shannon and Foxton were using poles that
had been shipped about two months ago from Aus-
tralia, when they discovered a lively young snake
hidden in a cavity between the bark and wood of
one of the poles. Maoriland, of course, doesn’t own
such a thing as a snake, and such were the emotions
of the finders that they were reluctantly compelled
to despatch the Aussie token with an axe. But
hasn’t that two-months’ fast of' the voyaging wrig-
gler got some bearing on the recent Abo. references
to the snake’s ability to do without tucker for long
stretches ?
* *• * *
“Steve Hart” : Dr. Bancroft, the Queens-
land scientist, who is breeding scrub-turkeys in cap-
tivity, says the male will not allow the hen to lay
till the mound has got to the exact temperature re-
quired, and should a hen persist in leaving a nest
the old boy kills her. Dr. Bancroft says he lost
three hens last year from this cause. What has the
Council to say on the matter?
* * * *
“Colub” : oome time ago, at a city animal
shop, it was decided to give a 10ft. carpet-snake a
meal, the first he had had for more than three weeks,
and two large, hefty-looking rats were put in the
cage. The wriggler
made short work of
one, hut the second
was a different pro-
position. Instead of
CO wering, panic-
stricken and paralysed
with fear while the
snake approached, he
backed into a corner,
exhibiting every sign
of fight and showing
his teeth fiercely. When
, the reptile got close
to him he rushed and
Secured a. grip jU/sit
over the nostrils, sink-
ing ■, his long, sharp,
teeth deeply into the
flesh. , Every effort to
make him let go was
Unsuccessful, and with-
in a few minutes the
snake was exhibiting
marked signs of ex-
haustion, its attempts
to free itself by swing-
ing the rat around be-
coming fewer and
fewer. Eventually the
rat was literally chop-
ped away from its
victim with an axe.
The snake’s nose
proved to be badly
mauled, and several
days later he died, his
head first swelling to
more than' twice its
normal size.
: t Tli at F^do of Reason (B.
3/8/ who turned the odd trick by bringing out
the old lady’s brolly, would be a good cobber for
a cat owned by some friends of mine at Glenelg
(S.A.). At irregular intervals this feline saunters up
to the house bearing a young chicken alive and
quite uninjured. He must pinch them from a fair
distance away, for so far no infuriated , owner has
followed him, and diligent inquiries have failed to
reveal the source of his supply. Grimalkin displays
the greatest pride in his treasure-trove, and watches
approvingly while the prize is conveyed to his
owner’s fowlyard. If this par. gives anyone a clue
to any missing birds, I suppose I’m going to lose
some good fiiends and a few chicken suppers, but
one must chance these things in the interests of
the Council.

demonstration of this on three occasions. First
he deserted a pearling boat at Maekay and walked
back home to McDonnell, near Gape York (about
1000 miles). Later he deserted at Nonnanton and
walked home (about 600 miles). Later still he
escaped from Palm Island, where he was serving a
murder-sentence, and again sauntered' home (about
800 miles). But' these are Ibng-distance walks.

* X- *
Geo. Rich” : A Westralian farmer of my
acquaintance parades a hen with a super-ambition
in family-raising. She' was discovered in an old
outbuilding with her feathers spread among 71 eggs.
Her desire to hatch out the whole setting by part-
time service on different portions of the nest quali-
fied the whole 71 eggs (the product of a co-operative
society of hens) for the cemetery. On the same
farm last year, by the way, a Rhode Island Red
dropped a single-yoked egg which balanced the
scales at Ifoz.
(( “Country Ped”: I don’t know the book,
“Voyages and Adventures of Capt. William Dampier”
mentioned by “O. McKay M.” (B. 30/8/’23) as
having been published in 1770 (Dampier died in
1715), but, according to C. R. Long, the title of
the book the old buccaneer wrote was “A New'
Voyage Round the World.” In this book, so the
same historian avers, Dampier mentions “a sort of
racoon, different from that of the West Indies as to
the legs; for these have very short fore-legs, but
go jumping upon the hind-legs as the others do.
Like them, they are very good meat.” Long con-
siders that Dampier described the small kangaroo
common in the neighborhood of Shark’s Bay,
where the navigator spent eight days in
August, 1699. Dampier also saw “two or
three beasts like hungry wolves, nothing but
skin and bone.” So that rules out “O. McKay M.’s”
statement that the old pirate saw no animal of
any description. That he should not have done so
seems strange seeing that in 1688, when a member
of a buccaneering expedition in the Cygnet around
the Philippines and the East Indies, he and other
members of the crew (the captain and 36 had been
marooned a fate that awaited Dampier when they
passed the Nicobar Islands) spent two months over-
hauling their beached ship on the north-west coast.
“Condamine”: The slackened birth-rate
among rabbits in drought seasons is not due to
delayed conception or to an instinctive strike against
parentage, the animals having regard to the difficulty
of raising the offspring (B. 23/8/’23) ; it is simply
a case of “in-the-springtime. . . .thoughts-of-love”
business. I have spent a few seasons “spreading
the tongs,” and am convinced that courting only
takes place when there
is green feed about,
and the female has her
kidneys somewhat lined
with fat. In the 1902
drought in the River-
ina (N.S.W.) rabbits
did not breed for 10
months, and the for-
getful farmers reckoned
they had the pest
under —until the rain
came. Two months or
so after that they had
another think coming
to. them. On river
flats during any
drought there ar e
always a few kittens
to be found, as there
are always a few green
patches on lagoon
edges. Also, in cold
mountainous country
when a dry spell breaks
the grass comes first on
the flats away from the
foothills, there being
as much as three
weeks’ difference in a
mile where the country
rises sharply; and the
arrival of the first
group of kittens cor-
responds exactly. As
a carcase trapper opens
all his catch, he has
a very intimate know-
ledge of Bunny’s little
secrets, and the poten-
tial young mother is
always in good condi-
tion. Next time Gin-
ger Mick shows you
a snowy-fleshed bunny
with kidneys covered
in fat and calls it Percy you can call him Ananias.
* * * *
“Edson”: Playfair was caught under a
fallen tree in a position in which he could not
help himself, and Playfair’s hound Toby, a large
cattle-dog of uncommon intelligence, set out to
obtain assistance. Presently he discovered Cuttle
walking on the Whybrow-road, and tried to interest
the man in the affair he had in hand; but, suspect-
ing the brute’s intentions, Cuttle merely threw stones
and sticks. In this extremity the dog decided on
a brilliant subterfuge. Dashing in to close quarters.
Ire secured Cuttle’s new felt hat, and made off with
it in his qjouth. Cuttle armed himself with a
sapling butt, and using language suit-
GETTING HIS GROWL IN.
CITY NIECE: “Good rain for the crops,

FABMER: “Good, per call it! Why, rain like

toe won't he able to harvest half of it.”
able for the occasion. In this way Cuttle was led
o where Playfair lay face-downward under a huge
limb. Here Cuttle dropped his club, seeing what
the dog was driving at. But in one thing Toby’s
sagacity was at fault. There was no occasion for
precipitation. Playfair was dead.

SPRING SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I often wondered how they knew,
The poets in the city lock’d;
But there are signs, and not a few,
To show the land by Spring is frock’d.
The dresses women wear in Spring
Announce that it is time to sing.
When Spring tells Winter to begone,
With sunny smile and cheerful scoff,
The women shed what they have on
And half replace what they take off
With flimsy things that closely cling—
Who blames the poets if they sing?
The drab and muffled winter wear
Is like the fog of mornings drear;
It hides so much of what is fair
That angels’ wings are far more near
Than pleasures women’s charms should bring—
No wonder poets sing in Spring.
’Tis thus they know the forests charm
The eye with wistful, dancing green,
The frolic on the distant farm,
The birds that in the bushes preen
Their feathers, painted bright for Spring,
And flutter up and down and sing.
They catch reflections everywhere
Of all the things they cannot see,
In pencilled eyebrows, borrowed hair,
And paint where faces ought to be—
Such aping of the mistress, Spring,
Would make a hash-house poet sing.

“R.S.”: Re “Ringer” (B. 7/6/’23) on
precocious flappers among stock. About eight years
ago a neighbor of mine here in Tas. who was a
cattle-breeder put the bulls out with the cows
and calves when the latter were four months old.
Those calves were only between 13 and 14 months
old when four of them increased the population on
the run. Incidentally, about 50 years ,ago, a
friend of mine went to N.S.W. and returned with
a young wife. At 28 she became a grandmother, and
she was a great-grandmother at 44.
TWO OF A KIND.
BAKER (to affluent friend): “My word, yours is the easy life!’
THE AFFLUENT ONE: “Well, yours is one loaf after another.”
“Saaedi”: “Monaro” makes a mistake
when he says (B. 30/8/’23) that the fox has nothing
whatsoever on the credit side of his ledger. Reynard
is really a very* efficient eradieator of rabbits,
specialising particularly in the young and innocent.
His method is to scent out a covered nest of kittens
and then dig straight down on to them. He doesn’t
believe in hard work, and will rarely ’dig a burrow
out from the entrance, nor will he. even take his
usual short cut from surface to nest if the ground is
hard or the nest is far down. As to adult rabbits,
Reynard snares them somewhat like the cat does. I
have seen a fox chasing a rabbit, but I fancy that it
would be only the aged, the infirm or the very’ youth-
ful bunny that would permit himself to be cap-
tured in this fashion. Pace certainly isn’t Reynard’s
long suit.
“Paul Cupid” : While
the kangaroo-skinners are
having a spell, will some-
one make an affidavit that
he has ever seen one man
who could peel the rind
off one wombat in one
hour? I helped a chap to
skin one, and the pelt was
so glued on the beast that
you couldn’t well tell
where the hide ceased and
the wombat began in even
the easiest part of the
process ; but when we got
to the part of him that
he used to sit down upon,
we were undecided whether
we had better get an axe
or a crosscut saw to finish
the job. I am prepared
to put up the wombat as
the toughest and tightest-
skinned beast we have in
this land—barring a poli-
tician. Not that I’ve ever
had the pleasure of skin-
ning one of them.
“Huffin-Guffin”: If the debate on the
’roo’s name has not closed, this, from a letter
written by Mrs. John Macarthur. from “Sydney, Port
Jackson, N. S. Wales,” on March 7, 1791, may be
of interest: “....They [the aboriginals] have no
means of procuring nourishment for themselves when
their strength no longer permits them to pursue
their usual avocation of fishing, hunting the kan-
garoo and other little animals on which they live.”
Mrs. Macarthur does not comment on the name in
any way.* It appears to have beer, quite commonly
used in i 1191. My extract is from “Some Early
Records oft the Macarthurs of Camden,” by Sibella
Macarthur Onslow (Angus and Robertson, 1914). To
class a kangaroo as a “little” animal seems strange
to those of hs who have seen “old men” up to seven
or eight feet high. But the lady was perhaps speak-
ing comparatively.
*** < *
“Yarra”: Tell “Keystring” (B. 16/8/’2B)
that he didn’t see all the albinos on Yulgilbar
(N.S.W.). I was stock-keeping there in the late
’eighties and early ’nineties, and frequently saw a
pure white willie-wagtail. He was domiciled on
Budglebar Creek, and could be seen any time within
a couple of hundred yards of the same spot. Unlike
“Keystring’s” jackass, his laundry was perfect; but I
never saw him in company'.
“Mac” : As a youth I had much experi-
ence with “coast disease” on Mickelo cattle-run
near Yamba, Clarence River (N.S.W.). There you
would find cattle in about three stages of disease.
At first they appeared stiff in the front legs, then
gradually became more
“proppv” and dis-
inclined to move
about, and finally they
got down on their
knees, which by now
were perfectly stiff.
All this time the
beasts grew poorer,
and, having reached
this final stage, noth-
ing could be done to
save them. It took
about three months
for them to pass
through all three
stages. I believe that
sajtpetre (or salty
grass) and brackish
water set up a rheu-
matic condition (simi-
lar to arthritis in
humans), which devel-
ops quickly. This area
I mention was cer-
tainly infected, and as
soon as a beast showed
signs of the disease
we immediately re-
moved the patient in-
land. Change of graz-
ing always worked a
cure. But if the ani-
mal reached the second
stage it was almost
impossible to get it
away. Middle-aged
cows of inferior breed
seemed more subject to
the trouble than their robust companions. Incident-
ally, I never knew a beast’s hindquarters to be
affected by the disease.
“The Deacon” : I can back up “FY7” (B.
23/8/’23) re the . efficac.v 1 of the green frog as a
cockroach-exterminator. Sixteen years ago I wrote
a par. on his activities in C. Queensland ; but what
puzzled me then and has ever since is where he
hides his enormous carrying capacity. Also, does
he hypnotise the ’roach? He will stalk the bird for
a minute or two and then, as “FY7” says, will go
to it hand over hand on the floor. There is just
an instant’s pause, a lightning-like stroke , and the
’roach’s day’s work is done. This little performance
he keeps repeating, and never seems to w T orry over
his overloaded commissariat. Perhaps he ejects
his cargo on the sly, and so keeps going.
“C. R. O. Eatre”: For the information
of those taking an interest in the percentage of
abos. still existing in Australia, let me quote from
the American Boilermaker for May, 1923. In an
article on “Boiler Inspecting in Australia,” an appa-
rently much-travelled person, by the name of George
Cecil, says :
Although Australia’s population amounts only to
five millions odd, of whom at least : a million 'We
descended, directly or indirectly, from the aboriginal
blacks, the country decidedly is a progressive one.
The colored man will act as assistant to the white
boiler-inspector for a dozen years without taking any
interest in the work. He asks nothing better than
to receive his pay every Saturday afternoon. The
soul of contentment is the native.
“Dune” : I saw the amateur heavyweight
championship fought the other
day. There was a great commo-
tion up the paddock, and when I
wont to investigate I found at
least 50 laughing-jacks applauding
like blazes, and, on the ground
three of the same species. One
was referee, the other two the
boxers. After fully 10 minutes
sparripg for position and rolling
in the mud, the larger chap got a
death-grip with his bill on the
other’s throat. He, didn’t seem
in a hurry to let go, and his
' opponent gradually weakened ; but
the referee didn’t call a stop, so
I did. It was a tough job separat-
ing them, too. All this time the
crowd on top was cheering loudly
—or was it hooting? The two
contestants flew off a short dis-
tance—the winner to laugh as if
nothing untoward had happened,
but the loser stayed in his own
tree for quite a while, dead beat.
Apparently they were settling some
argument; but didn’t the third
party give it a professional touch ?
“Adam”: “Huffin-Guffin” (B. 3'o/S/’23)
has set me remembering. Close to the now silent
and fast-decaying fountain in front of the ruins of
the old Government House at Port Arthur (Tas.)
is a willow-tree, which seems to. be weeping
over the days when the settlement was in its prime.
It is known as, “Napoleon’s willow” and is alleged
to have been grown from a cutting brought from
the grave at St. Helena. Cuttings have been taken
by visitors to all parts of the Commonwealth. I
know of one sturdy descendant growing in an East
Tamar orchard.
"Yacko”: The natives whom Torres for-
cibly carried away in 1605 (B. 16/8/'23) were
aborigines from the islands of the Straits. in
1623 the Dutch commander Carstenz, of the Pera,
in three different localities along- the north coast of
Australia dragged a ■ native aboard his vessel for
the ultimate entertainment of the Council at Batavia.
Carstenz was also the first to see a dingo. Dampior
was probably the first to observe the kangaroo, on
either his voyage of 1688 or that of 1699, but
Pelsart in 1629 noted some marsupials which he
described as being of the size of hares, the head
resemb ing that of a civet cat. The claim for
priority in sighting the black swan must go to
Ylamingh (1697). But I can find no mention of
the wombat till 1799, when Surgeon and explorer
George Bass made friends with one on Cape Barren
Island.
“Ringer”: I don’t want to bring up this
sheep-shearing argument again, but tell “King
Kurrajong” (B. 16/8/’23) that Alec Russell, the
blade shearer, will have to add a lot to his 207
in seven hours to catch Jack Howe’s record of 321
in eight hours, lip here in Bananaland, where the
big guns shear, this record is liable to stand until
the end of all things, as blade shearing is just
about settled. With machines, 300 and over are
common, the best yet being 337.
“Boori” : "Gayndah” (B. 9/8/’23) has the
dinkum remedy* for red meat-ants at his door —
sand. Drop a few barrow-loads of fine dry sand
on their dug-outs and keep it raked and dry. In two
days their engineers will be constructing new lines
of trenches. Apply some more of the remedy. In
a week what remains of the family will retire in
disgust to the proper distance. I learned this
cure after a hand-to-hand conflict extending over
years, in which I tried all the Abo. remedies, includ-
ing sheep dip (dry and liquid). Incidentally, I’ll
back the Barwon district (N.S.W.) in ; good season
to carry more a n ts to the square inch than any
other place on earth.
“Jimmy Possum”: Trappers and bushmen
are probably correct in saying that rabbits do not
breed when herbage is scarce. The breeding of
wild ducks is largely influenced by weather condi-
tions, the birds usually laying after heavy rainfalls
when food is plentiful, irrespective of the time of
the year. I have seen Mrs, Quack with a brood
in the dead of winter, when heavy late-autumn rains
have followed a dry summer. Then, again, the leg-
rope breakers often refuse! to keep their cradles full
when tucker is scarce,
“Pat Bushie”: Re the recent remarks by
an Abo.-parist on the gallantry of his old rooster.
Last week I bought a gamecock, and loosed him in
the fowl-run, presided over by an ancient white leg-
horn rooster. Very few minutes elapsed before the
newcomer commenced flirting with a young hen. The
old bird strongly objected to this, and a fierce scrap
ensued, in which the old chap came off second-best.
He got away in a corner to recuperate. Half an
hour later he was on the warpath again—this time
after the wayward hen, the cause of his downfall, the
bringer of disgrace to his hitherto respectable domi-
cile. Singling her out, he set to and cruelly beat
and otherwise illtreated her to. such an extent that
before I could effect a rescue she. had gasped her
last.
“0rney”:...... Wal Clarke, a well-known
rabbit-catcher on the Upper Murray, says he has
never seen snakes out in such numbers so early in
ON PLEASURE BENT.
"Where yer off to, Jacky?”
“Jes’ talcin' de missus for drive.” s.”
the season as this year. While going his rounds the
other day he had a box-seat at a great scrap between
a crow that had been caught in one of his traps
and a couple of wrigglers. As he whirled madly
round with the trap, the crow disturbed two tiger-
snakes who were sunning near a log. One showed
fight immediately, and there was a series of hissings,
neck-cranings and circlings, followed by pecking,
sweeping and trap-banging on the part of the crow.
Things were pretty even till Joe Blake No. 2 slid
in, and, catching the crow off his guard, bit him on
the neck. Clarke says the bird was dead in three
minutes.
A JOY RIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A tender moon was in the sky,
The grass was soft beneath my feet ;
In sooth I know not how or why
I chanced her sweetness there to meet;
But she was young and very fair
And seemed without a thought or care.
Just for that reason I was bold
To take her little hand in mine;
I felt her tiny fingers fold
Around my own like strands of twine —
Warm twine frayed out from the small twist
Of whiteness that she called a wrist.
1 said: “Dear girl, my aeroplane
Has wings to soar and seats for two.
The pathways of the air are plain;
The night has nothing else to do
Except to carry you and me
High over roof and mast and tree.”
She answered with a happy smile.
We climbed on board, the world dropped (jack.
The long streets walked in single file
And faded into brown and black.
The white stars blazed; and she and I
W r ent whirling up the silent sky.
Oh, dimples in the pleasant dark !
Oh, curls about a shell-pink ear!
Lightly I sailed my aery bark ;
Through clouds of joy we seemed to steer.
The old moon winked ; the white stars glowed ;
And far below the dark earth flowed.
Oh, love it is a simple thing,
A gentle tickling- at the heart;
It comes to happy souls a-wing
And tears the dusks of life apart.
I drove my ’plane straight into Bliss
And marked the frontier with a kiss.
The red star winked, the green star bowed,
The old moon shawled herself in mist.
Delight went piping on a c10ud....
I gave the steering-wheel a twist;
And rocking sideways, bucking free,
The aeroplane took charge of me.
It bucked, it wallow’ed, then it fell—
W7e were ten thousand feet from land.
She raised a little gentle yell
And suddenly let go my hand.
Then she shot out and so did I,
Pitched headlong through the moonlit sky.
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,
Through leagues of happy shining air!
I saw her small shoes, autumn brown,
Twinkle above her shining hair.
Headfirst she went at such a pace
I could not see her lovely face.
WOULDN’T ANNOY HIM.
POLITE COCKY (to new hand): “You won't mind if I leave that
alarm-clock in your room, eh?”
NEW HAND: “Course not-—it won't disturb me.”
Ah, well! What need to mention now
How hard she struck the grass below?
No intervening branch or bough
Caught her by petticoat or toe ;
She died as simple meteors die
Who lose their way about the sky.
Three seconds later I came down ;
The rock I hit was hard as doom.
One moment I beheld it brown ;
Then like a rose I burst in bloom,
And found that I had made a nice
Bold entrance into Paradise.
“Good luck!” I cried; but she arose
From pansy beds whereon she sat.
“You think that clever, I suppose,”
She said. And then the little cat
Told a tall seraph white and vain
I couldn’t drive an aeroplane!

The Earle Page couple were given a grand
party at the Cavalier on Monday afternoon.
The big room was crowded out with friends
from the Northern llivers plus the Country
Women’s party. Even the doctor’s old
schoolmaster turned ■ up to offer congratula-
tions to his “arrived” pupil; the opinion
that pedagogue Reay entertained of him even
in the days when he was at school would, no
doubt, have considerably surprised young
Page had they been then divulged. Every-
body made speeches; they started at 3 and
the word-weavers had still yarn enough left
at 5.30. The cheery doctor blushed and
smiled; but it was Mrs. Page, in her
Quaker-like, demure, brown frocking, who, as
the afternoon wore on, began to have the
look of one who is trailing clouds of glory.
And no wonder.
Gertrude Elliott gets into some joyous
raiment as Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife, and
manages to look younger than her own
daughter. The slim, boyish lines, it is whis-
pered, are the result of a wonderful system
of fat-abolishing exercises. Anyhow, the
lady, without being thin, doesn’t carry an
ounce of superfluous flesh. In her first act
she wears a nutty black-and-white morning
rig-out, the skirt in some dull, thick brand
of white crepe with a check in it. The coat
is of the striped sports variety, the hat is
small and snugly fitting; one white shoe is
fastened with a white and the other with a
black lace. There’s an afternoon frock the
color of sand, and about as arid; but an
evening frock of silver and mauve shot tissue
deserves three notes of exclamation. It has
a skirt-draping that will drive the suburban
Poiret to distraction, and a perky little train
like an appendix which has suddenly decided
to assert itself and emerge as a tail. But
the sleeping suit—black, with red bindings,
tricky red buttons from ankle to knee on the
leg parts, which are made more after the
jazz-pierrot style than a really go-to-bye-bye
covering!
The Lieut.-Governor’s gentle lady has
been busy during the week opening fetes and
such like. At the one in the Town Hall
for the Church of England Homes, she had
the help of daughter Ailsa; and on Saturday
her sister and her niece, from Tasmania,
supported her when she bestowed an official
blessing on a fete at the University, to aid
the Christian Union and University settle-
ment w’ork. Against the primmest of black
frocks the lady clutched a tight bunch of
flowers that looked as though the youngest
undergrad, had plucked them in a hurry. A
feature of the afternoon was Professor Hun-
ter’s lecture on “The Study of Man”; it
drew so many girls that the phonograph in
the dance-hall whirred through several miles
of jazz records before the floor thrilled to
the first foursome of gliders. There were
exhibits in the Fisher library—on e a Han-
sard whose contents had been eaten away by
white ants. Well, the boring process at
the Uni. isn’t confined to the small insects.
Italy had her night out last week, and the
Paddington Town Hall was the scene of the
rally. To the accompaniment of the shat-
tering cyclone and the withering blast the
sons and daughters of the Sunny South re-
joiced over the unification of Italy and
sent hallelujahs to the glorv of Garibaldi
and of Mussolini—echoing through the raft-
ers. The stairway and the ballroom were a
not of yellow roses, with which the red,
green and white of the temperamental coun-
try coquetted while the folds of the Union
Jack and of Italy’s flag mingled in lan-
guorous enjoyment of this piping time of
peace. President Truda, of the Italian Club,
and the president of. the Sicilian Club, had
a glad grip for all comers; Italy’s Consul
Commander Vitali did the honors at supper ;
and during an interval in the knife-and-fork
activities Consul-General Grossardi, who had
come from Melbourne for the party, made a
speech which freely translated was three
cheers for Mussolini. But George of Eng-
land was not overlooked ; a brimming beaker
was raised to him, and others to the King
of Italy (he’s the one with the nosegay of
beautiful daughters) and to Italy herself.
James Burns liberally endowed his family
and his pet institutions within his lifetime;
and still there was about a quarter of a mil-
lion left in N. S. Wales at the end. Besides
building largely at the Burnside Homes he
directed his executors to build up his endow-
ment futid to £50,000 and put another £5OOO
into bricks and mortar; £lO,OOO goes to
Burns-Philp’s office staff; thousands are scat-
tered liberally; and if young “Jimmy” doesn’t
want Gowan Brae, the big grey home with
the wide expanse of wattle-splashed grounds
outside Parramatta, the Presbyterians are to
have it —they are to get it after the son’s
death in any case.
The Not-Forgotten League went ahead
with its dance for the T.B. Soldiers early
in the week in spite of the official mourning.
The committee, learning that Dame Margaret
wished that no functions for charity should
be postponed, turned the Wentworth ball-
room into its gayest. The crush was ter-
rific. Heads bald and blonde, peroxide and
henna, decorated with giddy paper caps,
swayed fervidly or slumbrously to the bleat
of the saxophone; the balcony was crowded,
the palm court mostly a squeeze. In short,
the dance was the success of the week. Mrs.
Stanley Davenport was president of the
affair and clothed her office in black satin
swathings and silver lace; tall Mrs. Eng-
land successfully tried a new way of doing
her fair tresses, and shimmered in blue
georgette sheathed in silver tissue; and
Mrs. Richard Hagon, president of the Not-
Forgotten League, sparkled in black satin
heavily hung with jet lustres.
Nurse Duffy, the Tasmanian Nightingale
who attended N.S.W. Governor Duff in his
last illness, is still an active citizen. Though
well up in years when the war started, she
volunteered, left Sydney at a few houi's’
notice, and carried on till the Armistice.
Nowadays she has replaced the nurse’s apron
with a coarser one, and nurses chickens in
a poultry farm at Blacktown. Incidentally,
Captain Feilding, Dame Margaret’s brother,
was on Governor Duff’s staff when he died.
One very remarkable Australian woman
lived through the horrors of the earthquake
in Tokio. The only time she has been men-
tioned was in a list of the sisters who were
safe in a convent. This lady, a beautiful
and highly accomplished sister of knight
Mark and Dr. Stratford Sheldon, surprised
her friends by entering a convent; and after
doing some remarkable scholastic work in
Maoriland she sought duty further afield,
and was appointed superior of a teaching
order in Tokio, where she has lived for years.
The Onslows put off their dance at Cam-
den last Friday out of respect to the mourn-
ing of Dame Margaret Davidson. The
Feminists, too, postponed their hop till Octo-
ber. Most other frivols are sticking to their
original dates.
Mosman staged the pretty wedding of the
week, and padre D. F. McDonald, of the
Presbyterian Church, tied the knot. The
bride was Inverell girl Clare Duncan, and
her three bridesmaids came from the same
land of milk and bunny. The young man in
the case (hereinafter to drop out iof this
paragraph) was Englishman Silas Hocking,
and he gave his vellum-satined bride a dia-
mond brooch and a pearl necklet as an
earnest of his good intentions. Clare’s cousin,
Mathie Mclntyre, Zelma Futter and Bon
Wilshire froeked their bridesmaid act in
billowy shell-pink, blue and lilac, all toned
to a nicety, and each wore a tulle veil
of the same color as her frock moored to
her head by a wreath of silver leaves. The
Warringah hall seated 200 wedding guests,
and bride’s mother and father bore the eats
and burden of the party with cheerfulness.
Here’s Mary MacCorinick, a Maorilander,
with a typical Enzed complexion and a
mezzo-soprano voice that Sydney teacher Joe
Bradley is en-
thusiastic over.
She’s a cousin,
too, of those
clever Deloitte
girls; and
with the help
of cousin
Brenda’s ’cello
and Frank
Hutchens (he’s
still another
from the
whitebait Do-
minion), Mary
will give a
recital on
Saturday at
the Conserva-
tor ium. Tern
Barnett, who
surely learned
his accom-
panying in
some heavenly
choir, supports the singer.
Matron Heather MacGillivray, from the
Wellington Hospital, attired in shimmering
satin, walked up the aisle at St. Stephen’s
the other day to meet her future lord, Dr.
Manning-Hair, of a well-known Manning
River clan. Another sister, in a powder-blue
early-Victorian frock, and pretty golden-
haired Doris Masters were witnesses, with
Dr. Chapman, who played the role of best
man. Ivempsey will be the future home of
the new couple.
Prudence Middleton, of Kogarah, who was
chauffeur at Rose Hall during the war days,
and has helped to make many a pot of soun
in Mrs. Ormsby’s kitchen at Miller’s Point,
has engaged herself to A. C. Waters. He,
besides being an M.1.N.A.. is the manager of
the dockyards at Newcastle.
Mrs. Trevor Ross, wife of Eng.-Com-
mander Ross, of the Brisbane, has arrived
safely in Edinb’ro’ town, where she meets
her long-absent brothers, one of the British
Embassy in Persia, the other of the West
Coast ( Africa) Consular Service. Mrs. Ross
was accompanied by her kiddies, including
son and heir Hugh, the three-year-old, who,
against a small host of competitors, was ad-
judged “finest specimen of childhood” on
board, thereby winning “the freedom of the
ship.” Proud papa Trevor Ross has recently
added to his credit an invention which has
been already adopted by the Admiralty, and
is spoken of as something quite extraordinary.
Here is May Moore’s last picture of the
late tenor Sid
McDonald, who
had probably
a longer re-
cord of char-
ity perform-
ances to his
credit than
any other
Sydney singer.
To aid the
mother, of
whom Sid was
the main sup-
port, Sydney
artists are
arranging a
benefit con-
cert, to be
held on Oct. 3
in the Town
Hall. If it is
thrice crowded
Sydney will
not more than
half pay its debt.
Even the mighty have their weak moments.
Consider Professor Hunter, who knows every-
thing about animals, from Homo sapiens
down. Well, Fate handed him measles the
other day.
New headmaster Dettman and his wife
were welcomed by the old Sydneians on
Saturday. They both wore shining faces of
content over their reception ; she, besides, car-
ried a frock of shimmery black with an air.
The <old boys’ and the present boys’ orches-
tras alternately tuned up, and the new dance-
floor in the recreation hall was tried and not
found wanting.
Dorothy Ryan will take away in Novem-
ber one of our finest musical brains. At
her farewell at the Conservatorium the other
night she looked the personification of modesty,
though she had won both the singing scholar-
ship of the Royal Academy and the Woolley
Scholarship for piano last year. Everything
she did at her concert was marked by a
breadth of understanding; she carries with
her the make-up of a great artist.
Leaving her husband, Dr. Sinclair Finlay,
and six stalwart sons to mourn her, the
widely-known and popular Mrs. Sinclair Fin-
lay slipped west during the week-end. Be-
sides an unusually warm and generous heart,
the. lady had a charming speaking voice, a
heritage from Dublin, her birthplace, where
her father, Captain Richard Cook, had been
a well-known figure.
The Ma State had a lady motorist, Mrs.
J. A. S. Jones, in the just-finished Brisbane-
Sydney reliability run. But motoring stunts
are nothing new to her. On e of the numer-
ous Harris clan—cousin Reg was also a com-
petitor—she spent a year’s honeymoon nearly
two decades ago motoring round the Conti-
nent, and was one of the first lady drivers
seen about Sydney. Her husband, a Lith-
gow brewer, has always made a hobby of
sport. He is an old Cooerwull Academy'boy,
and their romance began with riding to
hounds.
Sydney is making a strong bid for Walter
Kirby. Already he has 20 Sydney pupils
at his own exclusive price. His rush of
work between Melbourne, Sydney and Bris-
bane has robbed him of at least three chins.
This week he sings in Bananaland.
In the vanguard of the wireless movement
in Sydney marches a woman—Miss F. Y.
Wallace, who earned her diploma in elec-
trical engineering at the Sydney Tech., an£
taking to wireless, opened a business to deal
in wireless requisites. She was there wait-
ing for the boom when it began to arrive.
Dorothy Seacombe, who is now with Law-
rence Grossmith, has a pleasant memory of
Sir Walter Davidson’s kind heart. While
she was playing small sister to “Tilly of
Bloomsbury,” Sir Walter and his two little
girls called in one afternoon at a matinee.
So charmed were they with the young
actress’s performance that after the show
they invited her to go back to tea with
Daphne and Diana, and returned her in the
Governor’s ear in time for the evening per-
formance.
Veteran newspaper woman Mrs. Fother-
inghame is starting out to found the ideal
kiddies’ paper. In the years before the war
every little girl and boy whose parents knew
the right thing to do subscribed to Young
Australia, a popular magazine of which
Mrs. Fotheringhame was editor. On the
ashes of the former favorite the lady is build-
ing a new venture, which is to have the
rather cumbersome title of Junior Aus-
tralia. It will be as full of good stories
and matter as its predecessor, and should
soon be as popular.
Mary Macfarlane, who years and years
back went off from Sydney as advance agent
in Eastern Asia for a touring musical co.,
was married in Shanghai four months ago.
She is now Mrs. Skinner, and her husband
is an Oxford blue or a Cambridge don or a
bird of that feather. Mary Lang-Meason has
taken over some of her work in Shanghai.
The students of St. John’s are holding a
frivol in the Wentworth next Tuesday. It
is to help along the sports fund, so they have
appropriately picked on Race Week for the
gaiety.
Mary Marlowe’s new novel, “Gypsy
Royal,” is blushingly on view in Sydney
bookshops. The Collins brothers are the
publishers. This is the second of the series
of three for which Mary contracted with
them. “The Ghost Girl” was the first. It
was a line out of a Bulletin story which
Mary read in early youth that suggested the
theme of “Gypsy Royal.” She has for-
gotten the name of the author, but the line
ran: “The way to keep a man’s love is to
put yourself beyond his reach.” Who wrote
it?
A Brisbane postscript:—
Duleie, the youngest girl in the Feather family, of
Indooroopilly, said “I will” to Bruce Phillips, in St.
Thomas’s, Toowong, the other day, and did it in ivory
satin and pearls. Norman Osborne tied the knot.
Lucy Duff (Sydney), Ella Feather and Ruth Yeo-
wart were bridesmaids. After a wedding break-
fast laid for - 60 guests, the bride left for the
Northern Rivers in a frock of silk cashmere
cheered with Oriental trimmings. He went with
her, of course.
Mrs. Ahern, in black-and-white striped silk, tea-ed
May Power in the Gardens Kiosk a few days ago.
The star guest was in blue broche with a black design,
and a posied black hat, and among the bidden were
the Glyn-Connolly and Lance Jones matrons, Mollie
Dawson, Nell Brownlow-Cole and Evelyn Horstmann.
The shivoo had something to do with wedding bells
that are to chime before long.
Yellow was the high note at the South Brisbane
City Hall function for the Seamen’s Institute building
fund. The auriferous scheme included a floral um-
brella', daffodil light-shades and Iceland poppies in
vases swathed in old gold. The committee members
and their pals gave the supper, and majors and medi-
coes and Brisbane’s swankiest helped to swell the
cheque for the sailors.
The High School girls, from the defences of Somer-
ville House, raided a complacent public for help for
their swimming-pool fund and the South Brisbane
Memorial Park. The lure was a flower-show, with
a makeweight of fruit and vegetables, eurhythmies,
fancy dancing and kindergarten stunts.
AJI Hallows’ old girls got up a dance, with cards
as a side-line, to help the Mater public hospital; it
was at the Bellevue, which was lent by Mrs. Finnigan.
Lieut.-Gov. Bill Lennon and his wife, the Gilbert
Wilsons, O’Sullivans and Walshes were among the
patrons.
Ethel Campbell is now in the Backblocks, and fetes
and hurrahs are following her footsteps with warm-
hearted persistency.
The Field Naturalists decked the Albert Hall 'with
wildflowers the other day, and Government Botanist
White opened the show. Amateur-botanist Finck and
the Sydney Field Naturalists sent up some native
roses, waratahs and flannel-flowers, and a big pine
cone arrived from Tambourine Mountain. Albert
River and Stradbroke Island had to have a stand all
to themselves. The public, as usual, crowded in to
sniff the “heart of the scrub.”
The widow of Robert Johnstone, after whom the
Johnstone River was named (Premier Theodore has
just opened a new bridge over it), died recently at
a Brisbane private hospital. Johnstone was an in-
spector of native police and a pretty well-known
explorer, and his wife was one of the first white
women to penetrate the Territory. Capt. Gibson,
R.N., was her dad, and she spent most of her child-
hood at Watson’s Bay. She was going on for the
’eighties when she died, and had outlived her hus-
band by 18 years. A gracious, a hospitable and an
intrepid pioneer,
G. L. Bury, who was instrumental in causing the
first sugar-mill on the North Coast (the Moreton Cen-
tral) to he built, called together his pals to cele-
brate his golden wedding a day or two ago. Mr. Bury
can remember Queensland’s first pineapple, grown by
one Davey, of Woombye. His wife is a Traill, of
Aberdeen, and she came to Brisbane, as a kiddy of
six, 62 years ago. In 1904 her parents had their
golden wedding at Landsborough.
Died recently at Townsville, Mrs. Elizabeth Cor-
bett, who landed at Port Denison (now Bowmen)
when a girl of 16 —60 years ago. When the Ethe-
ridge goldfield broke out, she accompanied her
husband to the new Eldorado, and after that the
Georgetown, Gilberton and Palmer fields knew them
in turn. Her last 10 years were spent mostly on the
Lower Burdekin, where three sons are sugar farming.

Two of our foremost woolly tribes were
linked when young Tom Millear and Ruth
Sanger exchanged “I wills” at Tooralc St.
John’s, where, umpteen years ago, Tom Mil-
lear pere took unto himself his popular wife,
a daughter of the late Walter Fellows, then
vicar of St. John’s. As squatter Sanger, of
Wangamong (N.S.W.), led daughter Ruth up
the aisle she made an arresting little picture
in bridal white rippling to silver on the back-
wash of shimmery satin. Her tulle veil was
moored by a silver band posied over each ear
with orange-blossoms. More vegetation was
bunched in her hand, clamped her draperies,
and weighted the train, which was kept out
of mischief by a diminutive uiece and
nephew, Rat Sanger .and John Austin, both
adorably Greenawayed in white satin. Isa-
bel Sanger, Nancy Millear, Sheila Barrett
and Lorna Webb Ware bridesmaided in
frocks of expensively-simple white tambour
lace and white poke bonnets sashed with
silver, .each sporting a flirtatious pink rose-
bud over the right ear. Colin Johnson, Ron
Austin, W. Moule and Jim Millear all helped
the ’groom to keep his end up, and Riveriha’s
Bishop. Anderson adjusted the fateful noose.
No. 9 Darling-street saw the cake and con-
fetti conclusions, whereat Mrs. Sanger ap-
peared in black satin, gladdened by jet and
steel, and a smart black hat with feathery
effects. Mrs. Millear, looking young as her
own daughter, adorned champagne chiffonery
panelled with ecru lace dashed with black,
and her dusky picture hat supported a floral
posy. _ The bride’s sister, Mrs. Frank Aus-
tin lightened a black marocain outfit with
wallflowers on her hat. The bridegroom’s
sister Marjorie beamed in dove-grey, with
an ostrich feather aloft. When it came to
the talking, the bridegroom, who captained
Melbourne Grammar before he climbed into
a Digger’s khaki, rose to the oratorical occa-
sion with a brilliancy which was probably
inherited from his clerical grandfather and
that grand-uncle who was a Victorian Judge.
Among the relations were the bridegroom’s
aunt, the Lyell lady and her professor, Mrs.
J. M. Sanger, Herbert Fellows with
his feminine half and a troop of taking off-
spring. A squad of N.S.W. visitors came
down for the event, including Mrs. Norman
Falkiner, Mrs. Alec Sloane and several San-
ger relatives, the Malcolm Maslins, Mrs
11. A. Hay, some Hay daughters, and Mrs.
Izon. _ But the proudest person there was
the bridegroom’s old nurse. The just-weds
finally set out for a Sydney honeymoon,
leaving the rest of the party to dine at Men-
zies, with a “Sally” party to follow. The
event was celebrated joyously at the Mil-
lears’ Western District squattage, Edgarley,
where all hands downed bools for the after-
noon and were afterwards fed at high tea.
The Blinded Soldiers’ Social Club will
get a good financial lift from the dance,
bridge and bazaar frivol which overflowed
the Anzac House ballroom the other night.
Laura Nyulasy, in charge of an overstocked
flower-stall, guilefully took up a stand by
the entrance, where she unloaded her wares
with much profit on the passers-by. The
Chauvel dame was a graceful vision in black
velvet; General Coxen’s fair-haired wife, who
had helped push the thing as ticket-secre-
tary, flew gold and pale-green embellishments
on her black chiffonery; Mrs. Hume Turnbull
sported; gold insets on her black dress ; Helen
Rennie struck a vivid note in flame color;
the Glasgow dame suggested a moonlit wave
in green and silver hangings, and Mrs. Victor
Selheim; wrapped her black and white gown
in a Paisley shawl. General Chauvel headed
the committee responsible for the dance stunt,
and Japies Martin, who shouldered the job
of lion, treasurer, smiled broadly at the
weight of the loot.
Mrs. Frank Apperly, who produces and
stars in Mermaid Repertory Society plays,
is preparing to sail in January, to introduce
her two girl babes to her native Emerald
Isle. But she will be back in June, which
means that she will miss only one 1924 per-
formance, if any. The talented young
matron got her stage experience with the
Irish Players, and was tempted to desert the
footlights by Dr. Apperly, who decorates the
professorial staff of the ’Varsity.
Barrister Gerald Pigott’s elder daughter,
Helen, is engaged to Douglas, the hope of
the Peter McArthurs, of Camperdown. The
bride-elect, one of the best-liked girls in Too-
rak’s younger set, has inherited the brunette
good looks of her mother, who was the young-
est daughter of late Scots’ College head,
Dr. Morrison, and sister of the Edward Mit-
chell dame. The younger generation of the
classy suburb has been further thrilled by
the news that the only son of the Thorold
Grants has persuaded Nancy, daughter of
the medical Eewises, of Mount Lofty (S.A.),
to say “Yes.”
The Glaciarium did its bit for th Queen
Vic. Hospital the other night, wlu i a car-
nival cheque for £l5O slithered off the ice
iiito the treasury. The populace came in
shoals to see a bewildering succession of
thrillful spectacles. Chief .of these was an
“ice ballet,” in which the Simon Fraser
widow, Doris Armytage, Hilda Grice and a
Clendinnen damsel, upholstered in black and
white and partnered by a male quartette,
swooped and poised over the glassy surface
like a covey of magpies. Victoria’s skating
champion, J. G. Gordon, did a hair-raising
stunt with steel-winged feet, and Jack Good-
all, who twirls as unconcernedly on the
blades as June Roberts on her ballet slippers,
provided a startling acrobatic turn. And
the toboggan competition was chockfull of
speedy excitement. Mrs. Tweddle and
her daughters added to the takings with a
sweet-stall, and Mrs. P. R. Sutherland dis-
pensed the prizes.
Mrs. Emily Pettett’s death at Stawell Hos-
pital calls to mind that her late husband was
in the Uppah Chambah between 1864 and
1871, when material for political history was
being supplied rapidly. Pettett was a wit-
ness of those stirring developments which
caused James McCulloch to be in office four
times during the seven years; which brought
Charles Sladen, M.L.C., into power as a
stop-gap Premier for a couple of months;
which gave Graham Berry his first show as a
Minister under J. A. Macpherson for 21
months ; and which provided Charles Gavan
Duffy with his innings as Premier before he
became the third Speaker. Truly Pettett
had his crowded hours of glorious political
life. When he left the House in 1871 his
wife was hardly at the noon of her life,
being only 42. The afternoon and evening
were long.
Mrs. Freddie Shipman drops a line from
Los Angeles, where she is settled with hex-
father ; Freddie drops in now and again for
a perch and a bit of bird-seed in the intervals
of touring Canada with musical attractions.
Australia’s old friend Ola Humphrey and
her English husband, Captain Broadwood,
are other Califorian visitors, mainly for the
purpose of being near Ola’s mother. Ola’s
dressing is just as variegated as ever, and
she has had an offer that sounds like the
figures of a millionaire’s income-tax to appear
in vaudeville in a one-act play by Willard
Mack, the author of “Tiger Rose.” She was
tempted ; but her husband prefers his actress
on the hearth.
-The statuesque Gwen Burroughs, who
appeared with Marie Tempest, Joseph Coyne
and Louis Bennison, is playing at the Egan
lheatre in Los Angeles, in a play called
Getting Gertie’s Garter,” a tropical out-
pouring by Avery Ilopwood, the man who
wrote “Fair and Warmer.” Marjorie Ben-
nett is in the same cast; and, incidentally
fi red Niblo proclaims Miss Burroughs “the
imest actress in all Australia.”
Mrs. Arthur Robb, pictured herewith by
Rembrandt, is
a popular Mal-
vern matron
who is identi-
fied with many
p h il anthropic
activities. Dur-
ing the war, in
which her only
son was killed,
she gave up all
her spare time
to Red Cross
and patriotic
endeavor. At
present she is
busily helping
to direct the
Malvern end of
the Alfred
Hospital aux-
iliary, which
is putting its
whole weight
behind the
Alfred fete. It is her daughter, Mrs. Rupert
Downes, who is the prime mover in the
Auxiliary offensive.
Merle, the ewe lamb of the Malcolm
Roberts widow—a slim Titian-haired young
thing still in her teens—has decided bo test
the joys of a stage career, and has linked
up with the Emelie Polini co. Merle’s ruddy
locks are a gift from both sides of her
family. Her late father was auburn-
thatched, and so are her mother and maternal
grandmother, Mrs. Daniels, who was a
Morphy and a sister of the Countess of Darn-
ley. Little Mrs. Roberts, who is an allur-
ing-looking young matron with a fine singing
voice, lately convoyed her daughter back
from an English trip. The pair dropped off
at India on the return voyage to spend a few
weeks with Merle’s soldier-uncle, General
Roberts.
There’s a story of an up-country dad who
has been cutting up about the modern young
woman. A few months ago one of his daugh-
ters went travelling in “the East.” One
day dad received a cable: “Want your con-
sent engagement John Smith.” Dad’s reply
is believed to have precipitated the Etna
eruption. The young lady, however, remained
cool. Twenty-four hours later dad received
another cable : “Married, this morning. John
is an Anglican, planter, private income, per
feet manners. What more can you want?”
Edith Ilarrhy, song-composer, who in pri-
vate is Mrs. Daly, is returning to Melbourne
from Maoriland feeling very pleased. While
in Christchurch she met the Castles sisters,
who are giving a series of concerts from
Auckland to the Bluff. Eileen, on hearing
“Mary Magdalene,” one of Edith’s composi-
tions, immediately included it in her reper-
toire. The words of the song are by Enid
Mackey, a young Maorilander.
Here is Monteath’s view of Leslie Wilkie,
who recently had a private sale of his work
and was nearly overwhelmed by buyers. Modest
and unadver-
rised, Wilkie
has worked
in obscurity
for years,
though goio d
judges have
proclaimed his
ability as a por-
trait painter.
W hen the
Athe n a u m
Club wanted
something to
remind it of
Justice Hol-
royd, who re-
tired a few
years back,
Wilkie was
c o mmissioned
to paint the
old lawyer in
his wig and
scarlet trap-
pings, and he made an excellent job of it.
Another of his successes, a portrait of
Albert Gould, one-time President of the
Senate, now hangs among the immortals in
the Queen’s Hall. Wilkie, who was runner-
up to Meyer Altson in the National Gallery
Scholarship struggle in 1902, is a great-
grand-nephew of the celebrated Scotch
painter David Wilkie, and the new Curator
of the Zoo is his uncle.
Col. Percy Owen, who is preparing to
settle down as Director of Public Works at
the budding capital city, will be missed by
a big battalion —he is a cheerful person who
could be relied ion to add to the gaiety of
any social function. Mrs. Percy, who was
one of the Sydney Floods, is an aunt of
Mrs. Russell Clarke, and is at present in
the Cold Country, where she spent the war
years.
Gertrude Healy, with her violin, and Biddy
Allan, at the piano, gave a combined pro-
gramme in the Queen’s Hall the other night.
Too-little-heard compositions by Purcell, Wil-
liam Babell and Corelli were produced, but
it was mainly a Sonata menu. The bowing
intricacies in the hornpipe movement of Pur-
cell’s “G-minor Sonata” enabled the violin-
ist to prove the mastery of her instrument;
and both players rose brightly to the cheer-
ful occasion of the sparkling final movement.
It was Biddy Allan’s professional ddbut
that night, and she evidenced a fine sym-
pathy and musical intelligence, despite a
slight nervousness —and we’ll all forgive her
for that.
Norman Lindsay’s etching “The Song of
the Faun” has been receiving columns of
praise in Californian papers. The picture
has been on view at the Cannell and Chaffin
print-rooms. One paper speaks of the work
of the “incomparable figure-draughtsman”:
There are at least 20 figures, many of them beauti-
ful and voluptuous nudes, and he has given them a
flesh quality which surpasses that within the power
of any other living etcher.
Freda Hunter-Watts is showing some of
her talent as a period-dresser in “The Tem-
pest,” at the Playhouse. The first pale
gown, with the long- sleeves and the after-
thoughts of deeper color peeping furtively
from the hems when the frock is in motion,
is calculated to quicken young Ferdinand’s
pulse. Later Miranda murmurs sweet non-
sense in a sheath of flowered stuff, with an
overdraft of plum-tinted sleeves trailing away
without any visible object in life. The lime-
light man, who is still groping for luscious
effects, manages to impart a glow to Mir-
anda’s wardrobe and deepen the rich tones
of the upholstery worn by the King of Naples
and his retinue. The tall Sebastian, stand-
ing half in shadow when the staff of Pros-
pero strikes him dumb, reveals the insidious
beauty of purple in an amber light. The
same beam ripens the others’ raiment to
genial browns and reds; but it can only en-
hance the pallid green of Ferdinand’s best
suit. Somehow, a blonde-haired lad who
speaks nicely in green trimmings doesn’t
appear the most berserk of his sex. The
combination invites the populace to call him
Clarence.
A legacy of £lOOO from the late James
Manifold has just fluttered into the cpffers
of St. Martin’s Church, in Hawksburn, that
tiny suburb which is a sort of no-man’s land
betwen the high-toned areas of South Yarra
and Toorak. The church lately acquired a
dozen gift paintings from Dr. Kent Hughes;
last year someone gave it a peal of bells, and
someone else a tower to shelter them. Ex-
Anzac padre Sexton farewelled the parish
last year and flitted to England, and now
vicar Green —whose wife was one of the
Brighton McGlashans—has taken iover the
exclusive flock.
The Fred Knights’ younger daughter, Ida.
who, with her mother and married sister,
Mrs. O’Brien, has been dodging the cold
weeks with a stay in sunny Ceylon, lately
coo-eed that she had promised to make a
matrimonial date with one Sampson, of
Colombo. Mrs. Fred Knight, by the way,
was the youngest daughter of the late squat-
ter Falkiner, of the Iliverina.
The Melbourne Music Club, at its mopthly
gathering in the Vic. Artists’ Galleries, ex-
tended the hand of good fellowship to visit-
ing musical-man Dr. Whittaker, who was intro-
duced by Fritz Hart. Afterwards Hilda Roberts
and Stanley Adams turned on a sonata for
piano and fiddle by Pizetti, and a “Poeme”
by Sarly, both new ho Melbourne; and then
Fritz Hart directed a delightful performance
of the Bliss “Rhapsody.” The cream of the
local musical world was there, including the
medical liudalls. hon. sec. Muriel Campbell,
the Bernard Hall pair, the Littleton Grooms’
chick Jessie, and Professor Mackail’s good-
looking daughter, Mrs. Thirkell.
. Major Balmain, ex-Senator George Fair-
bairn’s son-in-law, lias signalled that he is
bringing his three children to Melbourne next
month to show grandad how they are develop-
ing; and the Clive Fairbairn youngsters are
thrilled at the prospect of a visit from their
cousins.
Mining-man P. W. Tewkesbury is an in-
curable roamer. He circles the earth every
couple of years, and between tinies wades
about muddy places in old miner’s, togs. A
recent letter from London tells of a wander
through France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria,
Germany, Bavaria, Holland and Belgium,
and mentions that he means to take in
Sweden and Denmark before coming home
via America. He has a son who, is flying
high in the wool business of Boston (U.S.A.).
A line or two from Adelaide:—
From England comes news of Rita Qoonan, who
sandwiched in a few days with the Weigalls at
Petwood between a trip to Switzerland and a
programme of work in Paris. Our ex-Ex. and. his
hospitable wife are loyal South Australians, for all
the briefness of their stay here, and moat voyageurs
to the Cold Country find their way to the beautiful
Lincolnshire home for a day or two.
The Bridges are following the example of their
predecessors in turning to the sea rather than the
hills for the summer. They’ve got Adare, the
Cudmore home at Victor Harbor, for December and
January, and motored down to lunch with Mrs.
Cudmore a couple of Sundays ago to see about
things.
Fetes are upon us in plenty—a bridge party lor
the Cr6che, a two-days’ effort for the WW.C.A. at
the Exhibition, another for the Walkerville Boys’
Home in the G. K. Thomases’ garden at Medindie,
with arrangements for a big effort for the Japanese
Relief Fund on the way. Lady Bridges pronounced
the opening benediction at the Y.W.Q.A. affair,
whereat the helpers included the Kidman, Goode,
Freebairn, A. S. Neill and Henshaw Jackson dames
and some of the Scammell clan. Among those who
turned up for tea and to patronise the side-shows
were 75 small persons from the State Children’s
Department as the guests of the Verco lady, the
Association’s president, who is now in England.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Carlyle Marshall and Dor a Muecke
are congratulating themselves because the, dance they
ran at the Palais has added over £127 to the
Kindergarten’s funds.
The National Council of Women has been plough-
ing through its annual meetings, and has ; re-elected
Mrs. T. R. Bowman as its president. She took office
temporarily when the Hackett dame resigned some
months ago, since when she has steered the concern
with a maximum of enthusiasm and a minimum of
fuss. Her presidential address claimed two things
as the Council’s chief strength—its membership (esti-
mated, internationally and rather staggeringly, at
20,000,000!) and the fact that it brings together
women who think along different instead of similkr
lines.
With £4500 in hand, the committee of the
Ross Smith Memorial Fund has decided to call for
designs for the statue that is to be erected. Both
English and Australian artists are to be given a
chance, and if the work is done in England the Com-
monwealth Government has promised free freight
and exemption from duty. The Light Horse Memorial
is in sight, too, and is to be the granite obelisk
suggested by G. G. Lawson.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
Fancied for the Epsom after her run-
away win at Randwick on August 9, Lady Aura
disappointed a multitude of backers in the Hawkes-
bury R. C.’s Flying Handicap at Moorefield. Per-
haps the mare shouldn’t be harshly judged for one
indifferent performance on a course with sharp
turns which don’t suit some animals. She cer-
tainly carried 171 b. more than her Epsom weight
(Bst. 21b.), and her appearance suggested that she
needed a race or two. But the fact remains that
she faded out of the picture after leading for a
few furlongs. When tackled by sturdy Jim Murillo,
the ultimate winner, who is not engaged in the
Epsom, she showed no fight at all. Oranian, burdened
with a stone more than the Bst. 61b. he will have
to hump on Saturday, finished more resolutely in
the Rowley Mile, but was unequal to conceding
141 b. to the serviceable Hoppicker. Loyal Irish
was running on well in third place, and should
win a race at the A.J.C. meeting, albeit the
Epsom is probably beyond him.
All going well, The Hawk will be at a very
short price when the starter lines them up for the
richest mile handicap of the year. But he is not
a big horse, and 9st. 71b. is a big weight
to carry up the severe Randwick straight. To win
he will require a decent position at the barrier,
a quick getaway, an uninterrupted run, judicious
handling over the final furlong, and, above all,
firm going.. And even then he might have to
strike his colors to one of the lightweights. Favored
by f 'the conditions mentioned, the Maol'iland gelding
looks capable of giving 81b. to Duke Isinglass and
The Epicure, 91b. to Grotesque, 111 b. to Cliffdale
and 14lb. to old Sir Maitland. He may also accounl
for Fleuriste and Polytheist at a difference of f
stone. But it is questionable whether he is 281 b,
better than the well-performed Bardoleur, or 301 b.
superior to Woodville and Pteropod—both fast be-
ginners who will make him carry his weight all
the way. Bardoleur is this page’s first choice. A
stoutly-bred four-year-old, nicely handicapped and
thoroughly seasoned, he looks an Epsom horse every
inch. The Hawk is selected for a tote bet, and
Fleuriste may also be worth a ticket. Few Rand-
wick-trained horses are as fit as this fellow.
Very little money has gone on Rapine for the
Metropolitan, but anyone bent on backing him in
Sydney last week would have had to take dynamite
odds. Yet the M.L. horse has a burden (9st. 31b.)
with which no four-year-old has won within the memory
af_ The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabifiaht. Poitrel failed
with less weight in 1918 and David in 1920. It
is against Rapine also , that he isl slow to find his
feet and is apt to get boxed-up in a big field- He
is a good horse undoubtedly, but this writer would
rather have David with 101 b. more and St. Andrew
with 111 b. less. Oranian, too, has a chance with
Bst. 31b. — he has won ever the distance and ran
i good race in the Sydney Cup. And there is
Mirthmaker, with 7st. 71b. He is an erratic beg-
gar, but he! can stay, and he has been raced into
splendid fettle. For one reason and another, there
are doubts about the condition of a good many
horses with Randwick engagements, but Mirthmaker
is thoroughly well. On that account this depart-
ment will give the capricious gentleman its No. 1
vote, with Sir Andrew and Oranian for places.
The A.J.C. Derby looks as open as when Salitros
surprised punters in 1920, and more so than when
Cupidon confounded them in 1921, and Rivoli last
year. On one of these occasions form pointed to
Furious, who was narrowly and unluckily beaten;
on the other Soorak and Caserta stood out on
public performances, and Soorak only failed in the
last few strides, Caserta finishing third. Nothing
stands out this time. Anything may win, for the
form has been perplexing in the extreme; certainly,
there isn’t a proved stayer in sight. On this account,
and also because (1) there is an unusually large
acceptance and (2) outsiders have won three years
running, it ought to be 6 to 1 the field. ~ And
so it would be if the A.J.C. had a straight-out
totalisator, and if the State Government abolished
its crazy embargo on the publication of ante-post
quotations. That idiotic interdict is the means of
thousands of punters being robbed in cold blood.
So long as it exists, and so long as the clubs aren’t
compelled to install straight-out totes, the public will
never get fair prices from the Sydney Tommy Mc-
Rook and his agents in other capitals, on important
events anyhow. In respect of this Derby, and of the
Epsom and Metrop., Mcßook has surpassed his
previous worst record for cramping the odds.
This page likes Tarleton for the Derby,* with
Lady Valais as an alternative selection and tote
bet. It was impressed with the Maorilander’s second
to Larillo in the Randwick Welter on Sept. 8, for,
carrying 71b. more, he gave the winner a long start
in the straight and would have been well ahead
in another 50 yards. On his day, Larillo is one of
the best Welter horses in the land. Lady Valais
is chosen as a place investment chiefly because she
is in the pink of condition. David, decently ridden,
should defeat Rapine and the rest in the long-distance
w.f.a. races ; and for minor handicaps, Inia’s Boy and
Iveneppil may be worth specking.
The Cypher’s failure to get a place in the
Aspendale Park (Vie.) Cup didn’t say much, for his
Metropolitan chance. There was a lot of money
for the M.L.-bred four-year-old, but, second to
Easingwold, from whom he was receiving 121 b., for
about five of the ten furlongs, he was unable to pass
the Westralian in the straight. Then Imputation
tackled Easingwold, and the tiring Westralian bore
out, leaving an opening on the rails for Heir Appa-
rent ; of this the veteran Lewis took good advantage.
It was an encouraging performance on Heir Appa-
rent’s part, and Lewis rode a beautiful race. It
is a pity that he will not be able to pilot Furious
in the Randwick races for which she was nominated,
that excellent mare, whose affairs have been handled
with wretched judgment since she made hacks of
Sister Olive and Harvest King in the V.R.C. Derby,
having gone wrong.

“Jack-Shay”: About 30 years ago Sydney
was afflicted with Sheffield handicaps as badly .as
it is now with pony races. Botany and Carring-
ton were the principal tracks; shoes, trunks, towels
and a trainer were the tools of the runner’s trade.
Thousands lived on the game. One well-known
bookmaker had a terrace of houses as his “stable,’'
with some 60 runners and their trainers installed
in it. As it is now with ponies, nearly every trades-
man with sporting tastes and a little money or
even a regular screw, was “backing” some runner
during the time he was training, relying on a plunge
when his man won to recoup him tenfold or a
hundred fold. But squaring and double-crossing and
general rascality finally settled the game. Cham-
pions won on their own without letting their backers
know; punters “balanced” their runners. Lead
insoles were artistically inserted in running-shoes.
The climax came when, after a series of ramps and
swindles and schlenters and red-hot heats which no-
body wanted to win, Frank Smith, the boss promoter,
stood out on the tracks and cursed the running'
fraternity to the umpteenth generation. He told
them he would live to see them all running their
best for a tenner instead of the £5OO and £lOOO
purses he had accustomed the ped. to expect. He
did, too. A year later boatloads of chastened
and hard-up runners would be seen heading for
Manly to run like redshanks for a £2O stake.
Quite a few of “the heads” in the pony game to-
day learnt the fine points of their unsavory busi-
ness on the old-time cinder-tracks.
Australia is acquiring a new heavyweight
champion every fortnight. The latest is Blackie
Miller, so called because he is a smith in the R.A.N.,
who stopped Sheppeard, the Lithgow man-mountain,
in the 11th round of a Sydney Stadium brawl;
Miller was down for “six” in the first round, but
came back strong and game. Not yet 21, he is the
makings of a good man. A year in America, where,
if he stood the gaff, he would have to box once a
month at least (Tom Gibbons had 24 fights in his
32nd year), would do wonders for the willing youth ;
it is because Australian pugs get so little ring
practice, as compared with the Yanks, that their
form is so inferior.
THERE WERE OTHERS.
MINUS TWENTY : “Ai say, old man, Ai wish
you'd return mai golf-clubs.”
THE OTHER END: “ Certainly, dealt boy. Er,
who's that speaking?”
Baro : Wink (B. 13/9/23) claims that
Clarence Weber was the greatest wrestler in the
world. The most beautiful, maybe, but the
greatest absurd! On his day Hackensclimidt would
have beaten six Webers in succession. When Hack,
was here he wrestled the two best men then in Aus-
tralia—Buttan Singh and Gunga Brahm—in the one
ring. Brahm he toppled over in a few seconds,
Buttan received a flying fall, which was not claimed,
Then, in a leisurely 2701 in., his mighty master
turned him on his back as if he were a child. Weber
had to meet Singh several times before receiving the
referee’s decision. Moreover, Buttan was 2st. lighter
than the elegant Clarrie, and quite 20 years older,

“15-30 : W. M. Tilden, who has again
proved himself too good for Johnston in the U.S.
singles, holds the world’s record in dropping only
four sets in four Davis Cup finals. When Uncle
Sam wrested the Cup from Australasia at Auckland
in 1920, Norman Brookes allowed Tilden to capture
only one game in the vital third session, playing
all over the champion with his vvristy serves and
uncanny placements, but losing the match in the
fourth round through the superior wind and speed
of the challenger. Tilden had an uninterrupted run
of straight-three wins in the finals until last year
when Anderson pushed him to the limit, hoisting
a score of 4—6, 7—5, 6—3, 4—6, 2—6 against
him. The same player took another 6—l set from
Tilden the other day, so on fig'ures Anderson is
responsible for most of the small blemishes on Til-
den’s wonderful achievement.
A rising- star in American tennis is F. T
Hunter, generally admitted to be the hardest hitter
in the world. If Hunter could only control the ball
better, his speedy forehand swipes would bring him
a few more trophies. He defeated Patterson at
Seabright last year, but in the National singles at
Philadelphia a few weeks later the big Victorian
scored 8 6, 6 1, 7 -5 against him. However,
the man has improved considerably since, for he
followed up his second place to Johnston at Wimble-
don by knocking out Vincent Richards at Phila-
delphia. Richards has had a rather rough passage
this year. He went over to Wimbledon with the
retinue of a prize-pug., including a doctor, who
kept, a strict eye on his diet and training habits.
Paragraphed and photoed by the London press, he
was expected to extend Johnston to the limit.
Actually, he was finished off in three straight sets.
E. W. Greenham, a Queenslander, who
drove a 9.45-h.p. Fiat, won the Brisbane-Sydney
motor contest, in which points were awarded for
reliability, hill-climbing, petrol consumption and
speed. A. G. Barnard was second in the same
baby Fiat with which he gained first place last
year, and the third car was an 18.98-h.p. Essex,
owned by 11. M. Hart and driven by Norman Smith.
Fifteen jiars earned the full 500' points for reliability
Veterans were prominent in the finish of
the Bathurst-Sydney bike race. J. T. Honeyman, the
winner, is one of five brothers who have been associated
with the game for many years ; he covered the 123*
miles in 6hr. 51min. 44sec., and earned the right to
represent N.S.W. in the Warrnambool-Melbourne
affair. Third was A. E. Holder, and fourth was
O. A. Horder, his son.

“Push Off” : Prior to 1912 the Inter-
national Federation de Natation Amateur refused
to recognise swimming records put up in tidal
waters. As a result, Barney liieran never had a
world’s best tacked to his name, although he was
far and away the greatest swimmer of his too-brief
day. In the year mentioned, E. S. Marks and
A. G. W. Hill attended the F.N.A. conference, and
convinced those present that Australian baths, Syd-
ney Domain especially, were so closely piled in that
the tide had no effect on the enclosed water except
as to depth. Thenceforward Australian records were
accepted as the genuine article. At the last meet-
ing of the Federation, however, some Yanks and
Continental delegates threw doubt ori times estab-
lished in Australian, Hawaiian and other tidal waters,
and investigations were ordered by the controlling
body. If tidal-water Mths are again ruled out,
world’s records now credited to Fanny Durack,
Beaurepaire, Charlton, Kahanamoku and Weissmuller
will disappear from the book. The only course
available to a Sydney swimmer with designs on a
record swim of 500 metres and upwards will be
Cockatoo Dock.
“Vanikoro”: The Solomon Islands have
produced one fine swimmer in Alec Wickham. But,
according to D. Jenness, an Oxford man who did
some, anthropological work there, Goodenough Island
(Papua) is the place to look for a world-beater.
Jenness avers that an (unnamed) Australian, an un-
usually fast competition swimmer, offered to give a
boy of 13 some lessons. , They started off with the
infant a yard or two behind, but the imp of darkness
caught up, swam roped his instructor, returned to
the shore and grinninglv awaited “teacher’s” arrival.
Oh Goodenough the kids swim a channel half a mile
wide to get to school. This should make for the
evolution of a brown Beaurepaire or Ivierart.
“K.E.”: Despite the popular impression
that oarsmen die early of athlete’s heart, the rowing
associations ip the various States include vigorous
old boys who were in school fours and eights during
the Crimean War. When the Albert Park R. C. (Vic.)
held its annual meeting, two foundation members—
W. Gordon and E. D. M. Thomson —came along
to look at the young fellows and swap yarns about
the past.. Also present was Harry Qxlade, bow of
the club’s great senior four, which put Albert Park
on the rowing map. The other members of that
crew were Alec Chamley, prince of oarsmen; Sam
Gowdie, good sport and stroke ; and Bill Leverett —
all have since helped old Charon across the Styx.
Alhert Park boasts 322 regatta wins, of which 34
were championships and 121 senior events. Murray
Bridge (S.A.) may equal that record some day, but
has a long way to go.

Had Queensland been admitted to the
Sheffield Shield competition the fixtures would have
needed drastic alteration. As it is, they have
been arranged much as in previous seasons. N.S.W.
is to play S. Aus. at Adelaide on Dec. 14. and at
Sydney on January 16 : Victoria it will meet at Mel-
bourne on Dec. 26, and ,at Sydney on Jan. 25. Vic-
toria tackles S. Aus. at Adelaide on Feb. 15, and at
Melbourne on Jan. 1. A match between an Aus-
tralian XI and The Rest is also the list.
0. E. Pellew, back to city life again, is
expected to play cricket regularly this season. With
him and with his brother L.V. (now a lawyer) and
Dr. Fisher, North Adelaide may regain the place
they have lost since the days of Gehrs and Claxton.
“Lond.” : An unusual insight into the Brit-
ish way of looking at sport may be got from
London Referee’s candid forecast of the England
captaincy against S. Africa next year, coupled pre-
sumably with that of the tour in Australia to follow
at Christmas, 1924. Rhodes or Hobbs would do
well, but, “as a professional will certainly not be
given the captaincy next year, whatever democratic
views may obtain in years to come,” it is no good
discussing either. Only five amateurs are allowed a
chance: Tennyson, Fender, Mann, Gilligan and Carr.
The qualities needed are set down in this order: (1)
social position; (2) popularity with other players;
(3) experience of international cricket; (4) inspir-
ing personality. Gilligan is mainly a bowler, and
therefore proverbially unsuited for captaincy. Tenny-
son “appears to have had his innings.” Fender is
“technically the best captain in England, perhaps
the best in the world,” and a proved success as
leader of Surrey. But presumably he fails on point
1 or 2, for the Referee has a “very firm belief”
that Mann will be chosen. The admitted detail
that he “doesn’t take his place among the 11 best
cricketers in this country” doesn’t seem to matter,
as against “social position.”
* •«• * »
“Adelaide”: By an odd coincidence just
when “D.P.L.” and “Tickle” were writing separately
(B. 13/9/’23) about (1) the chance of a football umpire
being really hurt by the ball, and (2) an aggrieved
club scratching for an important unatch, Adelaide
was agitated over those two points rolled into one.
Norwood had gone unbeaten all the season till only
three games were left; one they drew, the others they
lost badly. In the second unsuccessful match, against
South Adelaide, Bent, Norwood’s one outstanding
goalkicker, was reported for throwing the ball, hard,
at a boundary umpire who had unexpectedly called
it up. A. J. McLachlan, League chairman and sole
judge in such eases, took this as a serious assault
on an official; sen-
tence was “six
matches out,” cover-
ing all the finals and
a slice of next season
too. Public opinion
was staggered, regard-
ing the bit o| temper
as fairly punished by
a reproof or perhaps
one match off. Nor-
wood held a jpuibliic
indignation meeting, at
which there were cries
of “No Bent, no
match”; but wiser
counsels prevailed, and
they played the first
semi-final (against
South Adelaide again,
as it chanced) without
him —and won easily.
Meanwhile practically
all the clubs had joined
in urging “clemency”
on McLachlan, and,
after long pondering,
he reduced the suspen-
sion to three matches
—which covers the re-
mainder of the season.
“VIC” RICHARD-
SON, leading S.A.
footballer and
cricketer.
The Rugby League final for the City Cup;
was strenuous all the way. Glebe had a two-point
lead at the interval, but were behind in the second
spasm, Balmain having the breeze, until just on
time. Then the Reds, with an heroic effort, made it
level pegging. Referee McMahon ordered two extra
terms, and this time ’Main put on 20 points in as
many minutes, having 25 to 5 at the close. Balmain
established a record by carrying off both City and
League Cups, their reserves defeating St. George’s
second string.
The concluding match in the Australian
Rules competition was exciting enough for anything,
a great goal (Powers kicked it) giving Sydney the
victory in the last minute: Sydney 67, Newtown
63. Saturday’s football was also notable for the
success of the Chinese Soccer team in the fourth Test
match. They kicked 3 goals to 1 against a pretty
strong Australian side, and the crowd (approximately
5000) cheered them to their dressing-room.
• • # •
Some 56,000 persons dissevered themselves
from £2868 10s. to see the Vic. League semi-final
between Fitzroy and Geelong. As a spectacle the
game wasn’t worth the odd ten bob. On the ground
that he was out of form, Geelong’s committee had
decided to “rest” Bert Rankin, who had captained
the team during the season and led it, through sev-
eral tough battles, into “the four.” Thereupon his
brother Cliff, the side’s star forward, resigned, and
the 18 took the field a beaten side. So vicious wa s
the play that the crowd was continually hooting vari-
ous players, mostly ’Roy men. ’Roy won by 97
points to 62.
“Frenkle”: Geelong showed poor .-judgment in
dropping Bert Rankin. Though not now con-
sistent, Bert is still a great player on his day.
His elusive style and the manner in which he gets
the ball to a forward are reminiscent of the great
Rod McGregor, and, like Mac, Bert always prefers
to dodge rather than bullock. In this he has dis-
pleased prominent clubmen, who, governed by the
newest ideas, insist that the nearest way to goal is
through an opponent. Ted Rankin, father of Bert
and Cliff, was the pride of Geelong for a decade.
The League had no finer rover.
The Ass. final between Port Melbourne and Foot-
scray was equally turbulent. The ambulance carried
one man off, and two others temporarily abandoned
the game while they chased opponents round the
ground in a vain endeavor to belt sin out of them.
Port was successful (57 to 41), so there will be a
play-off between the same teams, ’Scray having won
the minor premiership. There is an alluring, possi-
bility of a few players being slaughtered.
“A.E.M.”: Anderson’s journalistic appre-
ciation of Anderson the tennis-player (B. 16/8/’23)
recalls J. T. Tyldesley’s efforts with a pen. Once,
after making a century, he referred to the feat by
saying “I managed to collect a few.” This is praise-
worthy modesty, but it is not what a newspaper
wants. The system of getting players to report their
own games is fundamentally wrong. It puts the
player in a false position, it. is unfair to the public,
and, as Anglo-Australian cricket experience shows,
it makes for bad feeling.

South Australia, which has for some years
held premier position in Australian lacrosse, has
seen an interesting change in the district premier-
ship in Adelaide. For years nothing has had a
chance against Sturt and East Torrens. This wet
winter, University and North Adelaide, which long-
ago were just as prominent, have jumped to the vop
again. The students, who include Gordon, easily
S.A.’s best attack man, won the final (4 to 0) for
the first time since 1906. and set all middle-aged
barrackers recalling Phil Newland and Julian Ayers.
THE CALL OF SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hate this never-ending hunt for rhymes
And phrases that may sound a trifle less
Stale than the gags in last year’s pantomimes
Or the most hackneyed openings at chess.
Ah! happy David Wright and Roderic Quinn,
I never had a solitary spark
Of fire divine like that which makes you spin
Lyrics which bays in older lands might win !
I wish I was a bookie’s “after dark.”
If one must write, lest the grey wolf should hook
His frame a trifle nearer to the door,
Were it not less fatiguing bets to book
That gents, with bags stentorianly roar
Than rack your sputtering brains for fancies gay
So cheap and trivial when caught? The lark
Can trill an unpremeditated lay—-
And Leon Gellert, too, and Hugh McCrae—
I wish I was a bookie’s “after dark.”
They smite their harps and build their rhymes like
dabs,
But I, who’m just a dub, require a spell
From hewing English into metric slabs
To make a triolet or villanelle.
Ballads to me are burdens. Though it’s Spring,
No vernal influences 1 remark
Like those that make the genuine poets sing.
I’d sooner be at Randwick in the ring—-
I wish I was a bookie’s “after dark.”

THE INKY WAY.
“M.” : Aileen Palmer, not yet out of sun-bonnets,
daughter of Vance and Nettie Palmer, has already
set her baby sandals in the direction of the Inky
Way. Her' very latest is a novel, which has so
far got to its twenty-fifth chapter. Someone,
equally famous as curious, inquired 1 of her the
genesis of the story, to which she replied “it was
a phrase which seemed to come to her.” This
book should be published with illustrations by-
Rose McCrae, who boasts 11 printed pictures at
11 years of age.
“Jaeky Roo”: Too often Australian editors are
callous brutes, and many a promising inky way-
farer has lost heart by their lethargy in returning
rejected MS. Fleet-street is engagingly courteous
in this respect. In London I could bank on getting
my rejects back by return post. Here one's JiS. re-
turns after a month, often soiled and rained with
unnecessary pencil marks. The freelance journalist's
road is a hard one at any time, and a little courtesy
smooths a few bumps. If there were more of it in
Australia the freelance would be less prone to migrate
to London.
“Alastor”: “P.X.” (B. G/9/’23) mentions E. .1.
Brady as one of the “pretty numerous Australians
who are torn between literature and Lsd.” Brady
told me he found farming at Mallacoota (lie.)
more remunerative than the production of books
in either prose or verse; but, nevertheless, last
year he tripped to N. Queensland to get the color
for a book, which, I believe, is now finished. It was
to have been entitled “Children of the Sun” ; but
he will have to fincl another name, that one having
been collared for another book recently reviewed
on the Red Page.
“Alex. Val”: I have just read a yarn in the Eng-
lish Red Magazine by Albert Dorrington. The plot
centres in a gold-mine, the manager of which is
addicted to smoking (and chewing) black cheroots;
and a former owner is invited to digest the informa-
tion that he took a handful of dollars for the mine
when it was worth a million. When the heroine
enters she tells her husband to look for something
“back of the old squatter’s hut,” and he, addressing
her as “kid,” opines that a noise outside is caused
by a pack of dingoes hunting buffaloes. There are
also references to “eating lead.” It looks as if Dor-
rington keeps in touch with Australia by means of
the Sydney Sunday papers.
“Alice J.”: “Quentin Pope” (R.P. 23/8/’23)
Tefers to Marie Bashkirtseff as a present-day writer of
literary confessions. It is nearly 40 years since
Marie Bashkirtseff died. Her journal, the one book
we have from her pen, was published in 1887,
three years after her death. And how anyone who
has read it could class this journal in the same
category as the memoirs of Margot Asquith and
other recent diarists is impossible to understand.
Marie Bashkirtseff has no place in that gallery ; indeed,
there is no parallel in literary history to this re-
markable autobiography of a woman greatly gifted
and greatly cursed. The glow of her genius. was
early sicklied o’er by the shadow of an hereditary
disease, which took inexorable toll of all her gifts
and finally of her life.
“Hugh”: In my early Sydney days I once dropped
in on John Norton with a couple of cartoons, and
found him engaged in an argument with a little
gentleman in a black bowler hat. John had the
visitor up against the wall of . his den, , and seemed
to be endeavoring to push the head in the hard-
hitter through the bricks. . Two of Norton’s hench-
men rescued Gent No. 1. and my turn came. But
I never got into the sanctum ; blocking me at the
head of the staircase, John brusquely demanded my
business. A little un-nerved by this time, I said
•that I had brought sus-some du-drawings for his
inspection. He asked me if I would wait in the
office while he went out. I stammered out “How-
how lu-long will you be?” “A hundred —— years!
bellowed Norton, and rolled to the bottom of the
stairs.
“Wilfrido”: This year’s Pulitzer awards further
advertise some well-known U.S. writers. Three out
of the four 1000-dolia.v prizes for the best American
novel, play and volume of verse go to Willa Cather,
Owen Davis and Edna St. Vincent Millay respectively.
Miss Cather is a Virginian, and edited McClure’s
Magazine. Her novel “One of Ours,” that gained
her the award, is a fine tale of spiritual emancipation
through war, and ranks with “My Antonia” as her
best work. Davis came in for the cash with “Ice-
bound,” a bitter play concerning the family strife
of the Jordans, an early New England group o?
settlers. Miss Millay is an actress-poetess, who
has widowed the lyric with a new simplicity ana
has written some arresting sonnets. Her volume,
“A Miscellany,” caught the eye of the judges. To
Assistant Attorney-General Charles Warren goes the

preme Court in United States History,” adjudged the
best American historical book of the year—a monu-

“Tocsin”: The Argus reference to the Melbourne
ourang-outang Mollic (B. 13/9/’23) was not
to be compared with the attention she received
from the Melbourne evening press. The Sun followed
the beast’s illness with solicitous interest, and
the Herald stuck Mollie’s daily bulletin, with de-
tails of her diet, in specially bordered pars, one
of which was adjacent to two columns on the
Japanese earthquake. After reading of piles of dead
bodies and miles of ruin it was soothing to learn
next door that the hairy patient was doing as
well as could be expected and was washing down
raw tomato with whisky and water. When Mollic
eventually turned up her toes there was a great
outburst of grief, and the “Death of Mollie” in huge
capitals simply shouldered Mussolini off the Herald
posters. No wonder a sardonic bobby told an in-
quiring stranger that the flags hoisted half-mast
on Federal Parliament House the other morning
were the nation’s tribute/ to the passing of Mollie.
It was cheering to discover some sense of propor-
tion in a policeman, even if you can’t get it in
the press.
THE METAPHORICAL MENAGERIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is also the danger of the pier proving
to be a financial failure, and going back on to the
Randwick Council as an expensive wnite elephant,
after it has killed the goose that lays the golden
eggs, by driving away the present crowds of Coogoc
surfers.” — Sun.
Wherever plain men meet and talk
A wild menagerie sets sail;
The metaphors rampageous stalk,
Pursuing one another’s tail.
The lion in the path is there
Scenting- a herring on the track,
Which some, however, may declare
To be a camel with a back
Broken by that last straw which shows
The shorn lamb how the ill-wind blows.
White elephants are by the score
To slay the gold-egg laying geese ;
And everywhere the dogs of war
Bark at the cooing doves of peace;
Yet, while the chickens home to rcost
Come swiftly as the crow that flies,
By wide advertisement unloosed
The pheenix from its ash shall rise,
And, managed in a proper way,
The local surfing-slieds may pay.
So, though the crocodile gives tears,
The early birds their worms obtain;
And erv of wolf by bul’s and bears
Is only raised for paltry gain,
And that’s the reason why the stork
Above the empty cradle weeps.
Thus after hours and hours, when talk
Has piled itself in muddled heaps,
The meeting ends; and with the rest
Lion and camel seek their nest.

“Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,” at Sydney
Criterion, is the sort of mixture of grotes-
querie and near-indecency that could only
have been “adapted from the French.” The
humor and cleverness are hardly marked
enough to make up for the lack of refine-
ment, and it is just a little surprising to see
an actress of the charm, and talent of Miss
Gertrude Elliott in a play of the kind. Cer-
tainly it gives her a chance to show her
adaptability and power to carry off the most
compromising situation with supreme skill,
but no dramatic art could give a semblance
of probability to the ending, where, the
American millionaire who makes a hobby of
marriage and a habit of divorce is shown as
having secured his real soul-mate at the
eighth try, after the lady has beaten and
fooled him in a contest of wits.
* * * *
At least, it is a high tribute bo Miss Ger-
trude Elliott that she delights her audience
as Monna, even in this riotous and risky
stuff. Her self-confidence and her archness
have full scope, her facial expressions meet
the most exacting demands of the piece,
which is saying much, and so do her clothes,
including the pyjama creations, which is
saying more. Miss Anne McEwen makes the
best of a rather colorless part as sister
Lucienne, and Miss Lilias Waldegrave pre-
sents an ample Miss George, who enters into
the spirit' of what plot there is with fine
heartiness. Some of the male characters
seem to have strayed out of their stage-
nationalities. Aubrey Mather, as the Mar-
quis de Mkmtferrat, suggests an elderly Eng-
lish golfer rather than a French nobleman
down on his luck and living as a decoy-duck
in a fashionable hotel, andl Mayne Lynton,
as Bluebeard Bnown, looks so little like the
tjpieal Yankee millionaire that he might be
a Welsh chemist or anything else. If the

author wanted brassiness in the character,
however, he supplies it essentially. William
Mollison, as Count Hubert de Linancourt,
is more convincing as the butterfly dude than
as the cheerfully inebriated gallant who stag-
gers out of his clothes, ior the less intimate
portions <of them, with such embarrassment
as the circumstances would seem to demand
in _ a lady’s bedroom; still, the latter is a
spirited presentation. Athol Forde is an ex-,
cellent Belgian maitre d’hotel.

At Sydney Royal “Quarantine” continues
to win the happy, if slightly enigmatic, smile
and the glad and entirely boisterous laugh.
True, the Royal is no longer the only Sydney
playhouse where the bedroom scene provides
the bonne bouclie of the evening’s entertain-
ment, but there is more piquancy and less
broadness in “Quarantine” than in the rival
production.

“The Cabaret Girl” jazzes and frivols

ished spirit. As mirth-purveyors, Madge
Elliott and Arthur Frith would take a lot

Snap and sparkle, also merriment and
melody, are being handed out in generous
helpings at Sydney Grand Opera House,
where “The O’Brien Girl” is fairly into the
music of her joyous songs and the whirl of
her shapely legs. The bouse is packed to
its utmost capacity every night, and the only
disappointment voiced is because there aren’t
more seats.

Confucius has been elected patron saint iof

Under the leadership of Long Tack Sam, a
troupe .of entertaining Chinese have left be-
hind them their solemn joss-house and
market-garden ways, and are gambolling
through yellow meads of asphodel, or some-
thing to that effect. They deal out much
conjuring, tumbling, juggling and plate-spin-
ning. not always brilliant, but sometimes
quaint, and there is some dancing by a pretty
almond-eyed flapper. No doubt Ethel New-
man will live up to what she is said to be,
but her first appearance only showed her
striving hard. Bert Harrow has returned
to sing of his love for himself, and Bailey
and Cowan continue to give wider cir-
culation to the inane but unescapable “Yes,
We Have No Bananas.” And Pauline Bind-
ley, Polly Peachum of the just-finished “Beg-
gar’s Opera,” with her heart intact even
after Macheath’s cruel desertion, is using her
fine soprano trills in several numbers.
On a one-man Sydney show: —
There is a gallery-full of interest in the exhibition
of 70 or 80 of Blamire Young’s pictures at Anthony
Hordern’s. They give a good idea of the wide
scope of his work-—impressions on very wet paper
in the style he early made his own, highly finished
still lifes, figure compositions, architectural fantasies
and the nude. And on the lot there is the clear
stamp of a gallantly adventurous personality. If
there is here and there just a suggestion of trust-
in-the Lord about his method, his painting generally
bespeaks a sound craftsman and at least a man who
can cheerfully kick over the conventional traces with-
out making an ass of himself. The two outstanding
features of Young’s art are his nice chromatic sense
and the dexterous way he can lay down clean, crisp
color. Many of his pictures are sheer little poems
in color (some are nothing much more than that) ;
and always is he a shining example to those too-
many of our painters who bow the knee to the
Moloch of Mud. The artist is seen at his best in
‘■‘Dream of Flanders,” a big, intricate and mainly
architectural subject. In it a massive composition
is well handled, a tremendous amount of detail
deftly and surely suggested, and an impressive color
scheme brilliantly worked out. Though there is a
touch of theatricality about the central lighting, the
workmanship and spirit of the thing are remarkably
fine. There are only two oils—-“ The Shepherd,”
already familiar through reproductions, and the
involved “Stadium in Convalescent Camp,” which,
though clever, emphasises the better craftsmanship
in the other medium. The exhibition is the most
distinctive one-man show we have had for some
time, and, apart from all else, it is important in
that Blamire Young shows something of what can
be done with Imagination—that vitalising essence
for which Australian art is athirst.

Sydney Lyceum may not be exactly the
headquarters of the Irish Self-Determination
League, but for all that many a colleen has
been watering “My Wild Irish Rose” with
her tears there this week. A good film,
even if it is somewhat down-at-heels in
theme; a striking feature is the mass of de-
tail that the property man has crammed into
it. “Ace of Hearts,” reached through the
same turnstile, doesn’t hold any brief for
cranks of the K.K.K. type. “The Sin
Flood,” sweeping all before it at the Globe,
is bovrilised melodrama, whose big grudge
is Booze. Also, Larry Semon, the most agile
comedian of the present moment, is creating
laughs as “The Agent.” Pretty Mary Miles
Minter is blazing her way along “The Trail
of the Lonesome Pine” at the Strand ; and
Viola Dana is making “Love in the Dark”
on the same strip of linen —which is just as
it should be made with gas the price it is. The
Crystal Palace still presents Charles Chaplin
in a rapid quick-change from broad-arrows
to a back-to-front collar. The Piccadilly,
which has been waking up lately, is now
screening “Camille,” with such big stars as
Rudolph Valentino and Nazimova doing an
Omar Khayyam stunt beneath the bough.
And, wonder of wonders, the film has the
supreme courage to turn a deaf ear to the
happy-ending craze. “Th e Girl of the
Golden West” has dropped into Hoyt’s, and
is the peg -on which half a hundred free
fights are hung. “The Christian” has
shifted its pulpit to the Lyric.
“The Tempest,” presented at Melbourne
Playhouse on Saturday, doesn’t but ahy
great strain on Allan Wilkie’s scenic re-
sources, except in the case of the opening
uproar where Antonio and Alonso are the
prey of Prospero’s magic storm. Here,
however, the atmosphere of the disturbance
is created by the brawling elements off-
stage, and the heavy gloom and troubled
voices of the passengers add to the illusion of
impending disaster. Afterwards the stage-
manager has an easy time, since, by intro-
ducing the shipwrecked wanderers before

Frospero’s cell, instead of “in another part”
of that sorcerer’s domain, Allan VVilkie is
practically able to produce the remainder of
the fantasy in one simple scene, thus gain-
ing immensely in continuity and directness-.
Generally speaking, the result Is successful.
Every situation is well handled; every
grouping is a picture; and, with few excep-
tions, the cast has an engaging poise and
assurance. Wilkie, as Caliban, is a gro-
tesque and arresting figure—a red-haired
souvenir of primeval man who lumbers from
his cave with his mouth buried in the bowels
of a fish. It may be an odd trick of the
actor, but Caliban seems pathetically intel-
lectualised as soon as he has a cup of Ste-
phano’s sack and starts kissing that jocund
waster’s feet. Augustus Neville does the
drunkard, to a turn, his hiccups being de-
livered with masterly restraint, Plumptoh
Wilson, as Trinculo, contributes his artful
bit to the revel with Stephano and Caliban;
but Vincent Scully is only a moderate King
of Naples, and there is a note of callowness
in the flaxen Ferdinand of Ellis Irving’s
conception. Leslie Manners is a dignified
performer of' miracles, but there is nothing
winsomely fairylike about the Ariel of
Kiore King. Miss Hunter-Watts, surpass-
ingly slim and gentle, squeezes the last drop
of rapture out of the part of Miranda.

At Melbourne Majesty’s there are two
more nights for Rosette to disenjoy her
amazingly imaginative dream, as she lies
swooned upon the straw. “Ivatinka” is to
follow on Saturday. It will be succeeded by
“Merry Widow.”

Refurnished Melbourne Royal is now the
home of melodies which the matutinal butcher
whistles gaily on his merry, meaty rounds.
“Sally” has many taking tunes in its com-
position, “The Schnitza Ivomisski” being not
the least takesome of them. But tunes are
not everything in “Sally.” Among many
other things the unparalleled foundation of
its plot goes for something. The idea of
Josie Melville having learned to be a lovely
dancer in an orphan asylum, of all places, is
a fair staggerer. Another notable feature of
“Sally” is the placing of Pixie Herbert, who
stands about 6ft. 2in. under the limelight, in
a position of professional philanthropy. Pixie
looks the part of a high-toned settlement-
worker, who goes around finding billets as
washers-up for foundling girls. The enor-
mous height of the lady compels her to be
interested in works of severe charity. A
very tall woman is born to command. When
Pixie eventually spreads her bat-black wings
over the beauteous Butterfly Ballet, you feel
that she is merely varying her usual means
of presiding over a committee.

From an Adelaide critic:—
The Society of Aits’ Gallery in Adelaide has
a one-man show, mainly of etchings, by John Good-
child. He has gained a wide reputation lately.
The N.S.W. Gallery has bought his careful study
of the old home of Adam Lindsay Gordon ; and his
“G.P.0., Adelaide,” and “Centre of Sydney” have been
selected for the Australian exhibition in London.
He shows here his pencil or pen-and-ink drawing
alongside the etching. A few deviations into figure
work do not offer much encouragement to pursue that
line, though a portrait of veteran painter James
Ashton proves about the best-seller of the lot.

“M.P.A.” (New York) : Harry Quealy, re-
membered in Australia as a juvenile with
the Pollards and later as a character-
actor in various shows, is in hospital
suffering from a stroke. Harry was
playing the down-and-out Australian in
“Rain,” the biggest money-spinner in New
York these days, and was just making his
final exit when the seizure happened. He
whs taken to a hospital, and for weeks could
not even make himself understood. Latest
reports are not encouraging; it is doubtful
if he will ever return to the boards. And
he had signed a contract for two years.
Quealy was a youngster with the Montague-
Turner Opera Co. when “Daddy” Caron con-
ducted for the sweet-voiced Annis.
“Fax”: Another link with the Brougb-
Boucicault past has been severed by the
death of Florence Harcourt. She came to
Australia with her husband, E. B. Manning,
in 1886, and appeared in two burlesques
with Fanny Robina as principal lady. Tail
and handsome, Florence specialised in tights
and tunics, playing Abdallah in “Forty
Thieves” and Thames Darrell in “Little Jack
Sheppard.” In straight comedy she got no
show with the B. and B. co., although her
husband stayed five or six years with it and
THE POPULAR FANCY.
Melbourne friend tells me that the bookmakers
are buying pictures. When they have a win they
say ‘That’s so much for a Gruner, so much for a
Heysen or a Streeton.’” — Pres. Society of Artists.
THE SALESMAN: “This is a, promising young
artist. It is his first exhibition, hut he
will come on fast.”
SHORTODDS: “Look here, I don’t know enough
about this game to go in for yearlings.
What’s your best price about the favor-
ites?”
was given a complimentary benefit as a
send-off; but as far back as 1888 she was
fairy queen in a J.C.W. panto, and when
George Coppin, in 1592, arranged for a re-
vival of “Little Jack Sheppard,” with Billee
Barlow in the name-part and Teddy Royce
as the old original Blueskin, Florence liar-
court was included as Mr. Darrell. Her
daughter, Dorothy Manning, has figured with
various seaside companies.
“Gard”: When Melbourne Royal was re-
opened for the first night of “Sally,” patrons
rubbed their eyes wonderingly. Except that
the private pens had not been altered struc-
turally, it might have been the Princess’s or
Palace. The furnishers and painters had
obviously found their inspiration further up
the street. In the seating, lighting, carpet-
ing, curtaining and mural decoration there is
little to distinguish the interior of the Firm’s
second house from either of Ward’s. The
publicity-man swears that the job cost £BOOO,
which probably explains why the re-modelling
of Her Majesty’s has been postponed again.
Even the re-dressing of “Sally” for the Mel-
bourne season is a sign of the times. In pre-
opposition days one ill-used wardrobe did two
or three shows, with a couple of revivals
thrown in.
“Buz Fuz” : The idea that an actress is
au authority on any blessed thing is steadily
cultivated by the papers that print the
ladies’ salaries in large type. If, for in-
stance, some professor announces abroad that
the eating of raw tomatoes with ice-cream
has a tendency bo cause necrosis of the in-
step,'! a herd of reporters is let loose on the
available stars, and the ladies’ opinions .are
printed beside those from people who can
deliver some intelligent comment on the sub-
ject. Nothing is too ridiculous or too
abstruse for some favorite footlighter to chat
about, though, as a rule, she is a darned
sight less qualified to talk on the matter in
question than many a suburban housewife.
The explanation of the Whole business is,
of course, the advertising department, which
compels certain sheets to cultivate the hollow
fiction that a reigning goddess is a George
Sand with a dash of Rosa Bonheur and
Florence Nightingale.
“Jacky Roo”: I’ll allow “McNorth” his
ideal amusement with a high-class listening-in
apparatus (B. 20/9/’23), but Heaven protect
him from the assaults of well-meaning ama-
teurs. By the ingenuity of a kid brother-I am
forced to listen to a nightly wireless concert
from some blighter in Rose Bav (N.S.W.).
We haven’t got a loud 1 speaker, so mum,
auntie, the kid, myself and twio people from
up the street take it in turns to use the re-
ceivers. It’s a solemn ritual. One leans
over the set and listens to a nasal voice on a
squeaky gramophone lacerating “Oft in the
Stilly Night,” or bleating a desire to go back
to Carolina or some other beastly place. But
you can hurl vegetables by wireless. The
man at the Pennant Hills station hates the
Rose Bay musician so furiously that when
the gramophone has reached its most poignant
passage he comes in with a harsh tattoo of
Morse code.
“Lud”: Joseph Coyne is appearing at
London Shaftesbury in “Katinka,” the
American-made comic operetta which pleased
Australian playgoers a good few years ago,
but which has only just reached England.
Joseph has the part in which Phil Smith
appeared here—the globe-trotting Yankee,
Thaddeus T. Hopper. At the back of the
Shaftesbury stands Daly’s, where Coyne’s
old-time vehicle, “The Merry Widow,” is be-
ing revived. Prince Danilo is now in the
hands of a young Dane, Carl Brisson by
name, and the present generation of play-
goers that knew not Joseph is voting Carl
just too lovely.
“Norbell”: The proposed Vanbrugh-
Boucicault revival of “The Notorious Mrs.
Ebbsmith” (B. 13/9/’23) reminds one of
time’s revenges. N’York found Pinero’s play
highly improper when Julia Neilson and
John Hare played it there in ’96. Said Life
in shocked tones :
It is distinctly bad, artistically and morally. It
should be shelved along with the plays of the Oscar
Wilde school. We have no Court Chamberlain here
to act as censor, but if there were such an official,
we do not think he would permit these plays, which
seem to be the joy of the author’s British con-
stituency. !
Didn’t Oscar Wilde remark that “to the pure
all things are impure”?
“Herodot”: What illiterate yobs are these
fillum-perdoocers! In a vulgarisation of an
English novel, the scene of which was laid
in the 17th century, the modern table along-
side the heroine’s sick-bed supported a
machine-made glass medicine-bottle, with cork
and printed label, which things didn’t come in
till long after Waterloo. The mediaeval
castle in another atrocity was fitted with
up-to-date windows, set in sashes with cords
and weights. I live in hope of seeing Charles
11. and Nell Gwynne flash across the silver
sheet in a Rolls-Royce, and Caesar bark back
at Brutus and Casca with an automatic
pistol.
“Octogenarian”: “Abbot Park” mentions
Sara Flower (B. 23/8/’23). I saw Sara in
1852 at Sydney’s one theatre, the Pitt-street
Vic. To the playgoers of that day she was
a Divine Sara, a position she gained largely
by her brisk rendering of the once-famous
ballad, “The Gay Cavalier.” How did the
last lines go in Saras version? —

Columbine : O. P. Ileggie, the Aaelaide
actor, has the sensitiveness associated with
genius. I have known him refuse to step
upon the boards until the programme belong-

moved from the edge of the stage. This hap-

pened in Jew York, under Granville Bar-
ker’s management. Barker’s stage was of a
more intimate nature than that of the usual
theatre; it absorbed the whole of the orchesr
tra-pit, and had entrances marked from both
boxes. There were no footlights.
From a wandering minstrel
Broadcasting- is a chaotic business in
New York. Irma Caron sang a programme of
Maori songs from W.E.A.F., the big radio station
run by the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. on
Broadway. Her songs got excellent press-notices
and drew appreciative letters from “listeners-in,” but
a few weeks later, when she gave a second recital,
many amateurs wrote that they had heard her only
in snatches. It transpired that another N.Y. sta-
tion had put the W.E.A.F. crowd out of action in
sections of New York and Long Island. Some of
the small stations cut the big fellows to ribbons
with their short wave-lengths. People with receivers
in Florida and in the West Indies often have a more
effective show than the radioman close to head-
quarters. In fact, the stations are getting so
tangled up that there will have to be Government
control of broadcasting, and that without delay.
Otherwise the effectiveness of the thing will be lost.
The clashing of wave-lengths will freeze the genial
rage for buying receiving outfits.
“Jacky Roo”: Not all male musical-
comedy choristers have missed their voca-
tions (B. 20/9/’23). London producers are
picking and choosing from thousands of
young unemployed ex-officers. In “The Lady
of the Rose,” at Daly’s, the male chorus con-
sisted of strapping ex-sioldiers, who frolicked
with the girls as if they really enjoyed it,
and whose heels crashed together in the en-
sembles with stunning precision and vigor.
And nowhere could one find a finer lot of
beer-drinkers and singers than the ruffians
in the ’Ammersmith “Beggar’s Opera.” No,
I’ll pawn my only shirt on the Australian
chorus-girls’ superiority. But the men —
God pity them !
“8.V.E.”: “Santander’s” par. (B.
13/9/’23) re the sangfroid of actresses in
distressing (and undressing) circumstances
reminds me. It was at the Theatre Royal,
Woolwich, in 1916, the play being “Her
Good Name.” The villain had enticed the
heroine to his attic by means of a forged
letter, and the lady was upbraiding him
stormily when a hook swung out from the
flies, got a firm hold on her skirt and petties
and swung back again, leaving the victim of
man, proud man, clad mostly in silk
knickers and a black scowl. But she was
equal to the emergency. Snatching the vil-
lein’s overcoat from the table she draped it
about her fair form. “Coward that you
are,” she hissed, “you might have spared me
that degradation!”
“Abbot Park”: The passing of Joseph Wil-
liams, head of the century-old English music-
publishing house, has a certain interest for
Australian playgoers. Under the name oi
Florian Pascal he was part-composer _of
“Jack Sheppard,” in which Fanny Robina
and Royee scored so well in 1886. In sub-
sequent revivals Billee Barlow and Maggie
Moore appeared in the name-part. A contri-
butor to the score of “Jack Sheppard” was
Hamilton Clarke, remembered in Melbourne
as orchestral conductor and director of the
Liedertafel in the nineties of last century.
“Second Murderer”: In Melbourne 10
years ago I fluked a “shop” with Horace
Skipper. Horace, an alert, dapper little
chap, explained that he had a world-beater
of a vaudeville sketch for five men and one
woman, and he would
play the woman. It
was a slapstick, knock-
about kind of night-
mare, with a devil in
it, and Horace re-
hearsed us morning,
noon and night for a
week. He was a
stricter producer than
Oscar Asche. At the
end of the week, what
with bruises and abra-
sions, we were as
parti-colored as
Joseph’s coat. We
had a try-out at a
Palace matinee, and
this resulted in the
act being placed with
Brennan and Fuller at
the Gaiety. There we
toplined the bill for
six nights and two
matinees, whereupon
Horace cheerfully an-
nounced, “Treasury at
noon to-morrow,
boys!” Noon found
us all lined up and
feeling that, after a
week’s gruelling re-
hearsals and nine pub-
lic performances, we
had earned iour un-
substantial salaries.
Horace didn’t appear.
On inquiry at the
office we learned that he had drawn
£4O or so for the act at 10 that morning
and faded out. He has never come to light
since, but if I could have met Skipper that
day I’d have played First Murderer for
once.
“Mancarn” : I never see the sheriff in the
pitchers pull his gun from his lumbar region
without thinking of a yarn of George Lauri’s.
George was playing “The Gondoliers” in a
town in Alabama, U.S.A., having got the
theatre from the local sheriff on a percentage
basis. After the show (business had been
good) the sheriff strolled in and mentioned
that a clerical error had been made in the
agreement, and that the comedian should get
only 80 per cent, of the receipts, instead of
85. “No.” said Lauri firmly, “85 is the
agreement.” “Eighty, I think,” said the
sheriff with an aggravating drawl. “Eighty-
five,” maintained Lauri, more firmly still.
“Think,” drawled the sheriff, pulling an 18in.
“gun” from his pocket and placing it deliber-
ately on the table with its muzzle pointing at
the Grand Inquisitor—“ Eighty.” Lauri
made a lightning calculation concerning
muzzle velocity, flatness of trajectory and
effective range, and then amended his terms.
“Eighty,” he said —“you’re quite right!”
The sheriff smiled, pocketed his gun, and
strolled out eating his cigar.
“Orb”: De Ivoven’s “Robin Hood,” men-
tioned by “Fax” (B. 13/9/’23), owed its
success more to the intrinsic merit of score
and book than to its pink-tighted chorus of
blonde Amazons, or the popularity of a
leading soprano. The opera was a credit to
its Yankee parentage. When I first saw it
in Australia, Charlie Kenningham was Robin
and Alma Gillette Allan-a-Dale. Alma Gil-
lette, a splendid girl, was cousin to William
G. of “Sherlock Holmes” celebrity. A mem-
ber of the Harry Conor Co., she was trans-
ferred to the Royal Comics for “Robin
Hood,” going back to the Conors afterwards.
Alma Gillette’s part in “Robin Hood” in-
cluded “Oh, Promise Me,” the song of the
piece.
“T. 0.1.”: A propos of Sadler’s Wells and
Henry Irving (B. 20/9/’23). Another of
Samuel Phelps’s men at the Wells was Fred-
erick Younge, who was at Melbourne Royal
in the ’fifties and. ’sixties. A high-class
comedian, he re-iopened the Lonsdale-street
Olympic, or Old Iron Pot, in 1859 with
“Extremes, or Men of the Day.” A brother,
Richard, arrived with Fanny Cathcart in
1855 to support G. Y. Brooke. After touring
Australia with a company Fred returned to
England and was killed in a railway smash.
Touching Hoskins, when he was taking his
final benefit in Melbourne, Irving cabled
£lOO.
PROFESSIONAL RATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The lady of the lodging-house
Gave Howard Vane a wintry smile,
As furtively she pinned her blouse,
And summed the mummer up the while.
Said he: “A furnished room I seek;
What are your lowest terms per week?”
The lady simpered. “Come inside,
I’ve sev’ral vacancies,” she said;
“I’m certain you’ll be satisfied.
Next month you couldn’t get a bed,
The rush begins then for the Cup—
My terms is fifteen shillings up.”
“Hum! Fifteen shillings up. T see!”
He gave a deprecating cough.
“I am an actor. Now —for me —-
Could you not take a little off?”
The lady answered with a frown:
“For pros it’s fifteen shillings down.”

AUTHORISED CAPITAL: £1,000,000 in 1,000,000 shares of £1 each.
ISSUED CAPITAL: £300,000 in 300,000 shares of £1 each, comprising
100,000 Ordinary Shares, of which 22,500 are fully paid and 77,500 paid up to 10/- per share.
100,000 Ordinary Shares paid up to 3/- per share, issued at a premium of 2/- per share.
100,000 fully-paid Preference Shares, preferred both as to Capital and Dividend, and carrying a fixed
cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum.
700,000 Shares held in reserve.
The Underwriters, under their Agreement, have taken the whole of the last issue of 100,000 Ordinary Shares paid up
to 3/- per share and issued at a premium of 2/- per share, and 100,000 Preference Shares preferred both as to Capital
and Dividend and carrying a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum. Of this number
the N.S.W. public are being offered
20,000 Preference Shares of £1 each, applications for which must be accompanied by £1 per share
(the full amount payable).
20,000 Ordinary Shares of £1 each at a premium of 2/-, of which 3/- per share must be lodged
with Application and 2/- per share paid on allotment.
Reasons for Increase of Capital.
Owing to the growing demand for the products for which this Company is
the sole Australian Agent, increased expenditure is necessitated in the following-
directions through the State of New South Wales and the other States of
Australia.
The increase of capital now sought is required for, inter alia, the following
reasons:—
1. The further and thorough exploitation of territories yet untouched by
machinery, etc., manufactured by the J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co.,
in accordance with the Agency Agreement between that Company and
Commonwealth Agricultural Service Engineers, Limited.
2. Whilst the high average cash payment of 65% of the purchase price has
been ODtained by the Company in the sale of their goods, the rapidly
increasing turnover necessitates the obtaining of further Capital to carry
the balance of money owing by the Company’s clients covered by
Promissory Notes and hire-purcnasmg agreements.
ALLOTMENT OF SHARES.
The Directors reserve the right to refuse any application for shares, and
also the right to allot pro rata, in the event of the issue now offered being over-
subscribed.
INTEREST.
Subject to allotment, interest on the preference shares will be allowed from
the day the application money is received by the Company.
CALLS.
The Ordinary Shares will be called up by calls at the rate of not more
than 2/6 per share and not oftener than once every two months, but the
Directors are prepared to receive from any applicants willing to advance the
same, all or any part of the money payable upon Ordinary Shares, and the
Company will pay interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum upon the money
so paid in advance or so much thereof as shall from time to time exceed the
amount of the Calls made upon such shares. It is anticipated that, owing to
the rapid growth of the Company’s business, it will be necessary to make calls
regularly every two months.
When the Ordinary Shares of the present issue are called up to 10/- per
share, it is the intention of the Directors to continue calls on both the old and
new T issues of Ordinary Shares until both issues are fully paid.
The Preference Shares are fully paid on application.
SECURITY.
The tangible assets backing the Preference Shares are £2/14/4 per £1 share.
SHARE APPLICATIONS.
The Directors have already submitted the Memorandum and Articles of
Association to the Committee of the Stock Exchange at Adelaide, in order that
Shares may be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
There is no American Capital in the Company.
APPLICATIONS FOR SHARES SHOULD BE SENT TO THE
COMPANY’S NEW SOUTH WALES BROKERS, MESSRS. PHILIP
PRING AND DOCKER, CORNER PITT AND HUNTER STREETS,
SYDNEY, from whom full prospectus and application forms may be obtained.
Application for preference shares should be made on Form A, and for
ordinary shares on Form B.
CONTRACTS.
The following contracts have been entered into: —
1. Agreement dated 35th June, 1922, between J. I. Case Threshing
Machine Company (Incorporated), of Racine, Wisconsin, U.S.A., and Com-
monwealth Agricultural Service Engineers, Limited, appointing the latter
Company dealers to sell all CASE Tractors, Ploughs and other Agricultural
Implements manufactured by the former Company for the whole of the Com-
monwealth of Australia, including the Northern Territory, covering a period from
the 30th June, 1922, to the 30th June, 1931, subject to the terms and conditions
set out in such Agreement.
2. Agreement dated the 18th November, 1922, between the same parties*
appointing the Company dealers to sell six-cylinder CASE Motor Cars and
attachments and repair parts for 30 years from the Ist January, 1923, for the
W'hole of the Commonwealth, including the Northern Territory, subject to the
terms and conditions set out in the Agreement.
3. Agreement dated the 6tl cember. 1922, between the Company and Mr.
Aynsley Vernon Bridgland, Managing Director of the Company of the other
part, to act as Managing Director of the Company for a term of nine years from
the Ist July, 1922, subject to the provision of the Company’s Articles of Associa-
tion upon the terms set out in the Agreement.
Certified copies of the above contracts may be inspected at the Office of
the Brokers, Messrs. Philip Pring and Docker, Queensland National Bank
Chambers, corner Pitt and Hunter Streets, Sydney, where a copy of the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company may also be inspected.
FINANCE.
The Board of Directors, in order to safeguard the interests of the Share-
holders, have arranged with Mr. E. S. Wolfenden, F.C.P.A., A.I.A. (Lond.) to
act as the Company’s Consulting Accountant and prepare frequent reports for
their reference and guidance.
The interests of the shareholders are fully protected by the constant
supervision exercised over all the Company’s goods, including those sold on hire,
by the Service Department of the Company. Thus through the Company’s assets'
being continually inspected, there is very little likelihood of the Company being
saddled with the repossession of an article that is damaged beyond hope of the
Company recovering its money and reasonable profit.
TURNOVER.
The turnover of the Company since the 30th June, 1923, has been at a much
higher rate than for the period covered by the accounts ended on that date, and
the Company can confidently look to this turnover being again considerably
increased. The profit for the current twelve months should therefore consider-
ably exceed that of the year ended 30th June, 1923, as show-n in the Profit and
Loss Account.
PROFITS.
The net trading profit to the Company, as shown in the Profit and Loss Account,
was £20,844. After charging against this the loss on realisation of leasehold
(£313), Tractor Demonstration (£1068) and Engineers’ Service Agreement
(£1140), most of which are non-recurring charges, the profit remaining is
£18,323.
Dividend at the rate of 8 % on the preference shares for the portion of
the year during which such capital was issued amounted to £2237, leaving
£16,086 available for dividend on the ordinaz-y shares, and provision for reserves.
This amount represents a return of 29£% on ordinary share capital actually
employed during the year.
A dividend at the rate of 10% per annum on the Ordinary Shares absorbed
only £6213, so that £9873 was left to be appropriated in the manner set out in
the full Prospectus.
With a much increased turnover, which is practically assured, the profits
for the current twelve months should be considerably larger, and should show
equally good returns on the paid-up Capital employed, so that there is little
doubt that after payment of the dividend on the Preference Shares, a handsome
dividend can be paid to the Ordinai’y Shareholders and generous provision made
for Reserves.
GROWING ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY.
The Company is now established and doing business in every State in
Australia, with offices in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Kadina, with
its Head Office at Adelaide.
In the past experience of the Company, 65.2% of the purchase price of the
Company’s goods lias been received in cash, the balance being covered with
Promissory Notes and hire-purchase agreements, but in spite of this high
percentage of cash received, the expanding business of the Company necessitates
more Capital to successfully handle a larger volume ot business.
The modern plant already installed has enabled the Company to make a
success of the business by giving complete service to the tanner.
MARKET POTENTIALITES FOR CASE PRODUCTS.
A vast market for this kind of work is open to exploitation throughout
the Commonwealth.
The Company has a large and rapidly growing clientele throughout
Australia and'is vigorously pushing the sale of CASE goods. These goods are
known for their quality in 100 different countries of the world, and their success
in Australia has been well proven. It is estimated by the Company’s Auditor
that, to cultivate, seed and harvest 1000 acres of such a crop as wheat, the use
of horses costs £l/3/9 per acre as against a cost of 13/8 per acre if a CASE
Tractor be used, the machine-power thus showing a saving in cost of 10/1 pet-
acre.
It is therefore clear that a farmer working 1000 acres can in the first year
effect a saving of £5OO.
The saving to the farmei-, in addition, would be less labor: a maximum
result from the cz-ops through timeliness in doing his farming operations, and
less likelihood of difficulty owing to climatic conditions, the saving of time
through the speed with which the tractor works, and, above all, by the l-elease
of land used for feeding of his working stock he is better equipped to undertake
mixed farming.
The growing recognition of these economic facts throughout Australia by the
farmei-s and other users of Tractors ensures the continual and increasing demand
for the Company’s goods.
The J. I. Case Threshing Machine Company has been established 82 years,
has an authorised Capital of 40,000,000d015., and is the largest manufacturer in
the world of quality Power Farming Machinei’y.
The rapidly increasing sales of the Company during the past eighteen
months are strikingly indicated on the graph given in the Prospectus.
The Company was formed in August. 1921, and its position on 30th June,
1923, was according to the Balance Sheet shown in the Prospectus.

Corsets Sp ecially Designed For YOU
GOSSARD Corsets are not designed like
other corsets. Gossard artists have
thought of you as belonging to one of the
nine ideal figure groups into which they
have divided all women. Special models
have been created for your particular fig-
ure needs—differently proportioned cor-
sets, differently boned corsets that will give
you just the support you need at your age
and yotcr weight to comfortably coax you
to the ideal proportions of your type.
A Gossard Corset designed for your very
own self is going to feel more comfortable
than you thought a corset could. It’s going
to meet you everywhere, with a steady,
uniform muscular support, but it isn’t
going to constrict or pinch you anywhere.
The whole idea of Gossard Type Cor-
setry is to bring you to graceful propor-
tions, one curve growing out of another
with no part unduly emphasized. When
this is done you will have an appearance
of slimness that the woman with a four-inch
smaller waist and your own hip measure-
ments can never have. A faithfulfollow-
ing of this simple rule will alone take
pounds and potinds away from a woman's
apparent silhouette and years away from
her apparent age.
Be honest with yourself: —are you com-
pletely satisfied with both the appearance
and comfort of the corset you are now
wearing? Or does it cut into your limbs, or
push up the bust when you are seated, or
cause an awkward, unbecoming bulge of
flesh under the shoulder blades and under
the arms, or do any of those many irritat-
ing things that the wrong corset can do to
hurt you and tire you out and make you
look years older than you really are?
When you can purchase a gentlewoman’s
corset for as little cost as the ordinary kind,
an exactly-right Gossard will make the

most of your natural beauty, will protect
your health, will be comfortable every
minute you have it on, will wash beau-
tifully and outwear two or even three ord-
inary corsets?
Go to the Best Store You Know
The stores selling Gossard Corsets take
pride in their service. You will be fitted by
an expert corsetiere who knows figure types
as well as corsets and who will assume full
responsibility for your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres, like Gossard Cor-
sets, are designed for the needs of the
nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne
models are priceless to the woman who
heretofore has been unable to find bras-
sieres with special shaping to support and
flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up
over the lower tops of the modern corsets.
Yet they are most reasonably priced
within the reach of every purse.

L.P.F.: Too long for its interest; you’ve
introduced much that is irrelevant. But it's well
done in places... .Vince K.: You don’t persuaue
us it is true... .G.C.D.: We estimate that it would
cost us about half a million. .. .T.M.W.: Get your
ear tuned.... George D.: “Matchett” isn't a bad
yarn; but there’s hardly the necessary kick in it....
Aarvi: Queer little sketch that made us do some
hard thinking. But we couldn’t quir. ."allow the
man.... Whiskery Will: Try a shave... .Doreen:
They’re on the road, but the first and fourth lines
of a stanza rhyming and the intermediate lines
kicking loose is an impossible form.... Hector M.:
No g00d... .8.G.E.: The verse is lame in all its
feet....J.C. (South Normanton): “Ghosts” have us
beaten. Don’t know what they mean. . . .R.T.K.:
The sonnet doesn’t quite get there. .. .Edward B.:
Very poor sort of sermon in very middling verse. . . .
Digger: Honestly, they’re not much good. .. .Wattle:
As light and airy as a piece of corned-beef trying
to look like a butterfly... .J.H.N.: Moves as heavily
as one of George Fuller’s explanations... .D.B.
(Townsville): Not for u 5.... Cohen: Your verse
rattles too many teeth in climbing over it.... Nora
L.: Hardly... .C.M.C.: None of them quite do it,
though all are on the way.... W.G.11.: You can’t
rhyme “whom” with “bloom’d” and “thistledown"
with “crown d” ... . Derwentside: Turgid stuff. And
if it were worth an attempt to cut it into shape,
what do you think a sub-editor can do with MS.
so closely typed that a sheet and a half pans out
about 1500 words?. .. .Bellerive: An excellent state-
ment of the facts: —
From the circus escaped
The huge elephant male;
In search of a jungle
He set off on the trail.
He crashed through a fence
At the back of a house,
And mangled a tree
As a cat would a mouse;
A vine-covered trellis
Did litter the ground,
Plants and fruit trees
Lay strewn around;
With the familiar ear-hook
He’s trainer appeared,
And back to the show
The monster was steered.
. ...G.M. (Canterbury): The “Song of Peace” nar-
rowly misses a place as a shocking example....
Heather P.: The sonnet goes too heavily... .L.W.8.:
A fairly successful effort to state a few common-
places in the least attractive fashion... .C.C.M.:
The “War Museum” misses. The phrase “make
them shy” is a bad fall. . . .E.H.M.: Doesn’t suit us.
. ...H.B. (Adelaide): As full of lumps as a sugar-
basin....No Name: The “Wearin’ of the Green”
parody is groggy; and parodies are poor things
at any time. .. . D.0.P.: No use. . . .R.L.T.: Well
written, but we don’t want it.... George M.: Your
love leaps and staggers too tremendously.... Heather:
You’ve got the wandering habit. We don’t mind
you dawdling round five blocks to reach the nub
opposite, but readers are thirsty and get annoyed
when you inveigle them into going with y0u....
Mombak: Another tragedy (the world seems full of.
them lately) :
“You dirty wretch,” said the drunkard’s wife.
“My God,” cried he, “I’ll have your life,”
And fiercely seizing her arm
Whereat she gave the alarm.
And cried, “Help, murder, police, you dirty dog.”
Whereon he made a blow with a firewood log.
It slipped and hitting his chest
Broke the buttons from his vest.
In fury now he grappled her
And called her a female dog and cur.
He made a swipe with all his might,
Which on her eye did fiercely light. •
He caught her by her leg
And swore he’d make her peg.
She fainted, and slipping towards the floor
He caught her up, dashed her ’gainst the door.
....Cecil M.: “His Friend” makes its little point
very weakly.... Vera B.: The highly moral tale is a
great deal too unconvincing... .T.P.D.: Very weak
gingerbeer... . A.N.R.: Don’t care for “Mystery”...,
C.F.L.: It doesn’t get within coo-ee. .. .M.J.N.: Too
crude in the telling.... D.S. (Hobart): You can’t
rhyme “Hades” with “maids” in this paper....
Arthur D.: It’s a poor sonnet.... Lloma: Mind your
ear. There is not much hope while it will let you
rhyme “car” with “ma”....Nora Pi: A few rhymes
would have helped one; a little scansion might
have benefited the other; but their chief, need is
an idea. .. . A.A.H.: “liitumi San” is too poorly
constructed and thin in matter. .. .11.L.N.: The
“wondrous bird of black and white” must do some-
thing more than “welcome the dawn with fastest
sheen” to get a hearing. .. .A.V.H.: Well enough
done, but this is a poor market for those wares....
A.W.S.: Sorry, but not nearly up....Ves. K.: The
attempt to rhyme “fauna” with “adore her” is heroic.
The rest is pretty terrible. .. .A.H. (Darlinghurst) :
The “Lover” must do a lot better to find a nest
under this red roof. . . .M.8.P.: “Tribute” too
slight. .. .H.W.8.: Cheap rubbish. .. .C.R.C.: So
emaciated that we suspect there’s a drought
where it came from... .Arthur R.: Very thin
and shaky... .A.F.W.: The verse is not remarkable
for a girl of any age Jocelle: Spoiled by the
“hath” and the “doth” ; and too frail to carry such
burdens.... Stanley C.: Badly done and without feel-
ing... .R.D.C.: Doesn’t either amuse or convince.
P.A.L.: Not improved Coreen N.: Nothing
there... .D.P.M.: It is of poor quality... .Valeria
C.: The catalogue of Spring’s beauties moves like
prose and gets to nothing... .W.G.D. : Nothing in
them.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
K.U.F.: Even Bruce wouldn’t have a valet like
that hanging about him 8.L.D.: The joke about
that joke is that it’s no joke at all. .. .C.O’K.: Just
plain bad drawing T.R.F.: Feeble little thing
A.T.G.: That lad’s not the only person who might
find jockeying a better paying game than art
E.V.P.: Below the mark —and that’s pretty low in
Germany these days P.D.: All ordered home
C.V.L.: If you are persuading people that that work
is worth buying, then you’ve got Hickson beaten
by a furlong P. 8.5.: If you must show a lady’s
leg then let it be one worth showing. .. .Val.: Con-
sidering one as a suggestion.
“Cinquanteneuvieme”: “Sucre’s” par. (B.
6/10/’23) about the kid who told a visiting
curate that her mother was suited with a
clergyman reminds me. An old man near
Lakes Entrance (Vic.) was dying, and an
elderly retired cocky, doing duty as a
Home Missioner, hearing of the sinner’s
condition, drove out to have a yarn and
offer comfort. A woman met him at the
door with “Mr. Smith will bury my hus-
band, thank you.”

The Belting that Serves You
Longest—Serves You Best.
Inefficiency in driving qualities of a belt —loss of power through slippage
and friction —will rapidly wear out any belt. Other things being equal, the
belt which wears longest is that which does its work best. The many records
of ten, fifteen or twenty years of service of
PIONEER LEATHER BELTS
are evidence of its working efficiency no less than its wearing qualities.
Minimise your expenditure on belting repairs and renewals by specifying
Pioneer Leather Belting for every drive.
The belt illustrated is an 18in. 3-ply Pioneer Leather Belt in Messrs. James
Barnes, Ltd., Linseed Oil Mills, Alexandria, N.S.W. It has been in constant
use on the same drive for more than twenty years, for the past five years
giving 34 hours a day service.

HOW
do the advocates of compul-
sory total abstinence propose
to raise the revenue which will
be lost if Prohibition comes to
Australia?
The revenue derived from
liquor taxation amounted last
year to about £9,000,000.
This nine millions would have
to be raised by other taxation.
As the sources of indirect
taxation are almost ex-
hausted, how can it be found
except by increasing income
and land taxes?
?
THIS IS THE POSITION
According to the SUMMARY OF AUS-
TRALIAN FINANCIAL STATISTICS,
Bulletin No. 13, this is how the Common-
wealth Revenue was derived for the year
1921-22:—
Land Tax £2,284,040
Income Tax 16,790,682
£19,074,722
Customs Duties—Stimulants. £1,981,882
Excise Duties—Beer . . 5,473,220
Excise Duties—Spirits. . . . 1,510,432
£8,965,534
DO
you in Queensland want your Income and Land Taxes
increased 50 per cent.?

“Barmudu” : After 12 years’ idleness the
turtle cannery on North-West Island (Cap-
ricorn group) is being talced up by a Mel-
bourne syndicate, and re-fitted with up-to-
date machinery. Operations are timed to
begin in October; during the following three
months 30tX) turtles should be treated.
“Sucre”: Re the way to pack pineapples
for overseas markets (B. 6/9/’2o). Two
years ago the son of a Brisbane postal offi-
cial supervised the arrangements that enabled
a shipment to London to land with the bloom
of youth on its cheek. A temperature of
44° was maintained throughout the jour-
ney by proper ventilation of the cases. A
London Dago sold most of this consignment
as table ornaments for 10s.- (id. apiece.
“L. Ree” : As an underground stayer red-
gum got a certificate at the A.N.A. exhibi-
tion ,of Australian manufactures in Mel-
bourne in 1913, when a fine polished table
was shown with a declaration that it was
made from a redgum sleeper which had done
52 years’ service in the ground. Likewise,
my home-patch was fenced in 1908 with con-
demned redgum sleepers that had been laid
in 1881, and I’m not even thinking of start-
ing a sinking fund to re-fence.
“Larry Longun”: Queensland can do a
lot better than “Jumbo’s” 128 bananas to
the bunch (B. 2/8/’2S). At my home on
the North Coast, consignments (Cavandish)
averaging 10 dozen to the bunch were com-
mon, and bunches of 20 to 25 dozen nothing
unusual. Our best hand was 43 bananas;
our best bunch (Cavandish), 378. The latter
was fully Oft. long, and had the tree not
snapped at the base when the bunch was
about three-parts grown it would have scaled
well above lcwt. “Jumbo’s” bunch was
good only as regards size of fruit, which was
considerably above tne average, but not ex-
ceptional.

"Spare Corp” : In N. S. Wales there are
42 totally blind ex-sokliers, and they are all
shareholders in the Blinded Soldiers’ Tea
Co. Their £4 per week pensions are sup-
plemented by dividends, and the majority of
them, as salesmen for their company,
earn money in commissions. A few of them
do other work; one, for instance, is a piano-
tuner. In the case of the limbless men,
many of whom deserve just as much sym-
pathy as the blind, there is sore need for
co-operative effort on the same lines. It
is all a question of organisation; and that
unfortunately hasn’t been forthcoming.
* * * *
“Wariht”: The Yanks were recently scoff-
ing at the assertion that a kauri-tree had
been found of greater size than the giant red-
woods of California. But there have been bigger
kauris than this one. A defunct tree of this
species was discovered 40 years ago by Gov-
ernment surveyors which measured one chain
round the butt. Meanwhile, the outsize in
pohutwekawas has been found on Mayor
Island (Bay of Plenty). Its spread covers
a quarter-acre, height about 70ft., girth at
oft. Gin. above ground 31ft. Some inked-up
picnicker would have been capable of putting
a firestick into it long ago only for the fact
that not many picnickers can afford the run
to Mayor Island.
» • * •
“X2X”: When the Bellbird colliery dis-
aster is investigated it may be found that
finely-divided coaldust caused the explosion.
Methane, when mixed with the oxygen of
the air, is usually the cause of explosions,
but it has never been found in this mine.
Moreover, when methane is formed, the pro-
cess is generally slow and long; and if it
had been collecting there for some time it
w-ould have been detected by a change in
the color of the lights in use. On the other
hand, there is always a certain amount of
fine coaldust in even the best-ventilated col-
lieries, and this dust may become quite as
explosive as a dangerous mixture of air and
methane, especially when the quantity of
it is suddenly increased.
**- * *
“Old Broad Street”: Australia will suffer
at the Empire Exhibition if it hearkens to
the voice of its London executive officer, H.
O. Smart, who considers it would be too ex-
pensive to send fittings and showcases en-
tirely inade of Australian wood. In 1920 an
exhibition of Empire timbers was held in
London, and Australia was handicapped by
comparison with other parts of the Empire
simply because no manufactured articles were
shown, with the exception of a railway wag-
gon made of W.A. jarrah. All other Aus-
tralian exhibits took the form of slices of
trees, which convey little or nothing about
any timber’s merits. The Indian Forestry
Department, on the other hand, showed a
beautifully-designed superstructure, contain-
ing a dining-room complete with ' furniture,
panelling and ceiling in padouk, a bedroom
suite in greywood, and an elaborate double
flight of stairs in the two woods. Canada
weighed in with some very fine specimens of
finished joinery in Douglas pine. The Com-
monwealth has poor hope of competing with
these countries until it begins to advertise
what its timbers can do.
“E.A.”: Time we began to consider our
tobacco bill seriously. We are sending out
of the country three millions a year; and it
isn’t the tobacco cos.’ fault. We growl and
growl and ask why the Tariff Board doesn’t
put pressure on the cos.—especially on the
big B.A.T.C.—but we do little, if anything,
to give the cos. what they want. Yet the
big co. itself has shown again and again
that we could do it: only lately it exhibited
some beautiful leaf grown and properly
cured at Turnut and Wangaratta. But stuff
like that is rare: mostly the leaf is ill-
grown and —almost worse still —sun-dried,
which means that it is coarse and brittle and
deficient in aromatic properties. The cos.
go further: they will make advances to
growers to put in proper kilns, and expert
advice is at their disposal free. Flue-
curing, intehsive methods, and close study
of soil and climate would make this country
independent of the Virginian farmer, and
keep some millions annually in Australia.
Up to now we produce only 8 per cent, of
our own requirements, and to our disgrace
most of that is merely used to mix with
the foreigner’s better leaf.

“Haka”: I noticed Henare having his
meals at the hotel, so I inquired if his missus
was away from the domestic nest. “Too
right,” said Henare; “she in te eternity
home.”
“Wilfrido”: Slang expressions may net
spring up in the court-room, but sooner or
later they come to be used there. In an
affiliation case I heard the girl call the man
her “steady,” while he confessed to regard-
ing her as his “permanent.”
“ Jacky Roo”: I don’t want to fall out
with “Carisbrook, Jr.” (B. 6/9/’23), but
his double-headed half-crown dated 1818 on
both sides puzzles me. I have an impression
that even in George lll.’s reign the date
was stamped on the tail side of a coin.
The centenary celebrations of the landing
of Henry Williams at Paihia, Bay of Islands
(M.L.), were held a while back by a gather-
ing of about 20 of his descendants. W il-
liams’s brother Bill, later Bishop of Waipu,
landed two years after him, and several of
his descendants swelled the family reunion.
“The Oldest” on some landmarks
Mr. Wyndham, a retired surveyor, lately claimed
(B. 17/5/’23) to have been the first white man to
set foot on Mount Wilson. No doubt he made the
first survey in 1868, but there is evidence in the
N. S. Wales Survey Office that William Romaine
Govett traversed the main range in this locality
35 years earlier ; his plan, dated June 18, 1833,
clearly indicates his traverse along the crest of Mount
Wilson (then unnamed). This plan shows also
Mount Irvine fairly accurately, but does not indicate
any actual traverse of it. Mr. Wyndham states that
Mount Irvine was discovered in 1867 by Mr. Bowen,
of Mount Tomah, but as it can be seen on
Govett’s plan the chances are that Bowen did no
more than discover a way of reaching it from Mount
Tomah. He no doubt was G. B. Bowen, recently
deceased, a son of G. M. C. Bowen, who himself was
one of our earliest surveyors.
“0.P.H.”: London House, in Elizabeth-
street, Melbourne, sold the other day for
£73,600 to James Richardson, stands on a
site which is linked with the gold-digging
days. The present seven-storeyed building,
a comparatively new one, includes the Lon-
don Tavern, whose few feet of bar must
wash up better than any claim the diggers
of the ’fifties worked. The Harris and
Marks emporium originally occupied the site,
and there was a gold-buyer on the premises.
Later a printery was installed in part of the
old building. To give himself more elbow-
room Richardson has bought an adjoining
two-storeyed shop for £27,000. In view of
the heavy figures paid for pub property,
either Greenwood, leader of the Cold Tea
party, or men like Richardson, of the Beer
Pump Brigade, are shockingly bad judges of
what is in store for the Trade in Victoria.
“J.C.PI.”: The late John Thomas Rowe
(B. 16/8/’23) was preceded as overseer on
Arthursleigh station on the Wollondilly
(N.S.W.) by Julius Shelley, who worked the
estate in conjunction with Fred Holt, son
of the owner of The Warren, an immensely
wealthy man in those days. Fred Holt was
as deaf as a door-nail, and Shelley, who con-
versed with him on his fingers, did so at
such speed that a third party could never
understand what he said. My father, the
late Rev. J. S. Hassall, of Berrima, mar-
ried Rowe at the same time that he married
the late John Hoey, who, by the way, was
burnt to death a few months ago near Coota-
mundra. The brides were Moore sisters, of
a very old Berrima family. That was about
56 years ago, and I’ve still vivid memories of
how we youngsters enjoyed the wedding
breakfast. John Harpur, whose son is now
proprietor of the Surveyor-General’s Inn at
Berrima —a building erected 90 years ago—
married another sister about the same time.
“Spectator” on a Judge’s strike: —
When Pope Cooper got the job of Northern Supreme
Court Judge in Bananaland he had to do some wide
travelling, which took him as far as Normanton.
He never looked on the majesty of the Law as a
negligible thing, and his travelling exes, were tre-
mendous—a fact which got on the nerves of Treasurer
James Dickson, who pointed out that it cost as
much to keep one Judge in the North as three in
the South. The upshot was that Cooper was told he’d
have to economise, a direction which made him
snort. Then came a day in 1887 when he faced
a very heavy calendar at Townsville. When he
took his seat on the bench he contemplated the big
array of prisoners for a moment, then electrified
the Court with the announcement that his exes, had
been cut down so much that he hadn’t enough to keep
him going in Townsville, so there wasn’t anything
he could do but discharge the accused before he left
on the following day. Virgil Power, the Crown
Prosecutor, got the wires to work, and matters were
arranged; but Sam Griffith, then Premier, was so
mad about it that, if he could have seen a chance
of. the House agreeing, he would have moved in
Parliament for Cooper’s removal. As he couldn’t,
Cooper scored.
“Oasis F.”: The death of police-superin-
tendent J. E. Miller, at Albury (N.S.W.), re-
calls an old Darling River tragedy—the
Nulty Bend murder. The body of a remit-
tance man was found in the bend by some
shearers. It. was covered by bodies of dead
sheep in a ’lignum clump, but a protruding
boot invited examination. The police, with
little to work on—the crime had been com-
mitted a couple of months before —had the
murderer in custody within a week, and he
was hanged in Dubbo Gaol. Had he beaten
the Judge and jury on that occasion, three
other dead-certain charges for similar crimes
were ready. His hanging was rather a messy
business, for the hangman allowed too big
a drop, and he was decapitated. The late
Inspector-General Day and Miller both had
a hand, with the rest of the Bourke force,
in laying the murderer by the heels. They
all got promotion, and Day, when he be-
came head serang, didn’t forget his old com-
rades. ' Hojel was soon a superintendent,
Miller went to Broken Hill as inspector and
afterwards to Albury as superintendent,
Cupitt went south as inspector and Doig to
a similar job in the metropolis, while the
others all got further lifts. Miller, like
Hojel and Day, died comparatively young.

Be a Rexona Girl!
It Means Health and Beauty.
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beauty. To be a Rexona Girl is
to use only Rexona Soap, and enjoy that natural beauty of the skin and hair
which cannot be imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain
free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even
the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing antiseptic balsams as
Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections
is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if it does
not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency
to pimples, and leave the com-
plexion clear, fresh and velvety.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUT of the deaths I came depths
beyond thought—
Abysmal forests, emerald pits o the
And the white gulfs of flame ere these could
be.
In unimagined hells and heavens of fire was
whirled
Through glory and great fear the spark or me.
Unto the heights I go—heights beyond
thought—
Range behind range the spirit-mountams rise.
Stark with their snows. Faith, like an eagle,
flies,
.Mounting the thin, pure air with moveless
wings,
And scanning all with piercing, golden eyes.
The rainbow springs from peak to stainless
peak;
The silver torrent from the sapphire cave
pours awful beauty. Here the heart must
brave . .
Perfections dreadful as those _ primal cliffs
Of blood and sweat where brainless dragons
clflVG*
Upward and upward—ah ! but not alone !...
In those intolerable forests first
You caught me to you; in their night
immersed . .
We learned the lesson of the twain-m-one,
And each awoke in each a slakeless thirst.
Through this long mountain-wood of lives
and deaths
I seek your hand as you are seeking mine. . .
Far, far above the spirit-glaciers shine.
Only together may we scale the steep
Of white Valhallas, dreadful and divine.
Yes, one-in-twain are we, but through us
beats
The ever-dying, deathless life of all;
And should a star faint or a sparrow fall,
Our pulses tremble, even though we sleep.
Through us the heights yearn and the dumb
deeps call.
Oh, from uncounted fountains we have
dfiink,
And from uncounted fountains we shall
drink!
From blood-streaked Circe-pools where wild
beasts slink —
From holy basins where the thornless flower,
No longer red, mantles the marble brink.
Upward and onward! Oh, the mountain
sides
Rise beautiful with perils! Pure cascades
Make sweet, sonorous thunder. Smooth-
stemmed glades
Reveal the nightless summits where the rose
Of morning and of evening never fades.

DULCIE DEAMER.
The Unforeseen Reward.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Beatrice armytage collected
statuettes as boys do cigarette-cards.
They adorned her very own library
in her father’s house at Toorak. Money was
“no object,” so far as she was concerned.
Neither, incidentally, was art. If a
statuette attracted her fancy; Beatrice pur-
chased it, and gave it pride of place in her
very own library, until she bought another :
then the first went into any odd corner, and
from there into a trunk, where it passed from
her life, pushed into oblivion,, as it were, by
newer fancies.
Beatrice was esoteric, and would tell you
so. She was a lily, languid and pale, like
that virgin bloom which grows whiter,
prouder and more disdainful as it views the
brisk young daisy and cornflower wantoning
about; and horror! the rose kissing the
garden-wall!
She confessed to a liking for Edward Cyril
Smaythe. She had told him as much each
of the three times he had proposed to her.
Edward had money—he had had it to
excess from birth. His aunt Sophie had
died and left him much : his mother had died
and left him more; and his father, dying last,
had left him a monstrous amount.
Beatrice was sitting in her very own
library, studying with her calm, cultured,
light-blue eyes the statuette in pride of
place, when Edward was shown into her
presence with the fixed intention of submit-
ting his fourth proposal. In form and fea-
ture Edward was attractive, though he, too,
had over much of the lily about him. It was
his habit in society to tap his mouth with
spotless white fingers and irreproachable
nails, and yawn, and look pale of face and
colorless emotionally. In Beatrice’s pres-
ence, however, he lost much of his languor,
the reason being that: for the first time in his
life emotion was strongly at work within
him.
But Beatrice sighed gently, and shook her
head as emphasis to her thoughts. “I would
like to, Edward. You know I like no one
better than you, and if I could I would. But
I have —I have —-Edward !” she said, smiling
sadly, “I must be honest with you”-
“Do !” he implored.
She took her wandering gaze from the
statuette in pride of place, and puckered her
brows. “It is your idleness. You have no
definite object in life.”
“I—l beg your pardon?”
“How can I explain?” she moaned to the
statuette; then, evidently gathering informa-
tion from it, she continued plaintively: “You
see, Edward, it is your money. You aren’t
really to blame, and that is why I can’t heln
liking you. But you’re no good in the world.
You drift. Money has ruined you. Every-
thing you want you immediately obtain”—--
“I Avant you.”
“Don’t joke, Edward, please. You’ve been
brought up in the—the —lap of luxury.”
“So have you !” he exclaimed in bewilder-
ment.
“But I am a girl. AA’hat spoils a man just
makes a girl understand better—life—and—
and —there is time —and opportunity to—to
think. Oh, why had you so much money,
Edward? I dream of a husband who has
done something in the world—if it were only
—only coalmining—and who can do some-
thing, not just—just live.”
She looked appealingly at him. Very fine
he appeared as he sat up straight and said
without hesitation: “Very well. I’ll give
every penny I have to orphanages, hospitals,
schools and”
“Oh, stop ! That won’t be you ! That will
be your money. It is you yourself—oh, can’t
you understand! Of course, I’m fond of
you, but you’re far too polished and spotless.
Your hands, Edward ; your hands !”
“My hands?” He inspected them.
“They’ve never done anything. And if
only they had!”
At this interesting stage Beatrice was
called from the room. Edward strode to
and fro in perturbation. He passed and re-
passed the statuette in pride of place three
times before his eyes encountered it; then,
drawn irresistibly, he confronted it and
stared. The elucidation of the mystery that
was Beatrice stood before him. Beneath
the statuette was the pregnant word “Labor.”
Mighty, alert, supreme, proud, tremendous,
the white mannikin, nude but for a species
of blacksmith’s apron, towered above the
name-plate. There was something uncanny
in the brutal strength that the figure sug-
gested.
Edward retired to his chair, and fell into
a reverie. Presently Beatrice returned. He
stood up.
“I begin to understand you, dear,” he
said ; “and I like your not wanting to marry
an idler. If I prove to you that lam able
to battle along, if necessary, as well as any
man, would you”
“Oh, I would! Oh, yes,” she said. “But
you can’t”
“I can. I’ll trot away now and think it
out. I’ll write you, and you can write back
an answer—yes or no. You imagine I can’t
fend for myself. You wait and see!”
Duly his plan was formed, written and
despatched, and an answer in the affirmative
returned. The gauntlet was thrown down
before life. Edward Cyril Smaythe was
pledged by honor and pride to earn a living
as a common working-man during three
months, health allowing. At the end of that
time his word as to whether he had failed
or succeeded would be taken. He began by
giving his valet three months’ holiday. He
managed to put himself to bed: that was
something, but he lay awake all night.
In the morning early he was treading the
floor. His chauffeur appeared.
“Car’s ready, sir.”
Edward sat down. “Where was I going,
Carson?” he said wearily.
“AVoodend races, sir.”
“Oh, well, I’m not. Garage the cars and
take three months’ holiday.”
As he was retreating Edward called him
back.
“Carson—er—-when a man has never done
anything but his own eating, smoking and
breathing, what positions are open to him
in the—-er —labor market? Be calm! I’m
not ruined ! I’m only a tame lunatic wish-
ing to wed. Can you advise me?”
Carson betrayed no astonishment.
“Cars, sir—you know all about cars”
“Of course!” Edward pumped the man’s
hand admiringly. “Done! Good man!
Take three months’ wages and get out.”
The lover turned to his morning’s paper.
An advertisement caught his eye:—
Man: Competent for garage; thorough gen. know-
ledge motors necessary. Apply Clinnack’s, High
Street, Northcote. 8
Half an hour later Jerry Clinnack, one-
time noted “speed king,” rubbed his oily
hand across his cheek. Edward felt undigni-
fied under that steady, shrewd stare. “Never
had a job before?” said Jerry. “Exactly.
t And you look it. Never mind; wait a
minute while I see.”
He disappeared into an office at the end
of the yard.
“Pat,” he said, “peep over and see what
you make of him. Mr. Edward Smith. I
tipped him off in a minute —he’s a young
swell gone broke and got to earn a living.
It’s written all over him. AA’lrat d’you
think?”
Pat scrutinised him over a frosted pane.
“He looks decent enough. Oh—you could
give him a trial, couldn’t you? He’ll soon
get broken-in or sacked. I suppose he
knows about cars.”
Clinnack returned to Edward. “You can
start as soon as you like. How about quar-
ters? There’s a good little room on top y’can
have for a nominal rent if you want to live
handy”
“Thanks,” said Edward.
And so he disappeared from the ken of his
friends. The good little room on top took
one more weight from his mind. He went
away, returned with clothing and toilet
necessaries, acquainted himself with the good
little room and commenced his martyrdom.
All he had to do now was hold out for
three months. Oil and grease became his
bitterest enemies or truest friends—they
stuck like either. His physical body ached
nightly and daily; his hands, once so tender
and white, grew stains and blisters, while he
cleaned, repaired and sometimes drove cars;
swept the garage, and, death to all dignity!
washed down the asphalt outside each morn-
ing. At the end of a week he looked at his
crippled hands, and wondered how he could
see his lunacy out to the bitter end : but a
jaw, never prominent before, went forward
doggedly, and he continued.
Besides, he now had a double reason for
winning out. Laughter stings. Pat. who
exercised full authority when Clinnack was
absent, used to laugh at him; and at each
laugh all the blood of the Smaythes rose in
him, and he tortured his back and hands, and
worked harder —so hard, in fact, that Pat
ceased laughing and explained reprovingly
that he was not called on to work himself to
death.
“That,” said Edward, “is not your busi-
ness. If you can get me discharged for work-
ing too hard, do it.”
The blisters on his hands disappeared in
time, as did the pains in his back. Physical
agony was over and after a month he sat
on his bed and laughed : for he had learned
from the teacher of life. Experience, the
truth of a maxim that shall never fail as
truth. Casting away all outside goads such

Have you any Skin
You can’t afford to neglect the slightest skin trouble. Such painful and
disfiguring complaints as Eczema, Ulcers, Ringworm, Poisoned and Festering Sores
usually start with a Pimple, a Rash or a simple Cut or Burn.
The only safe plan is to keep Zam-Buk always handy
and use it at once whenever you have any trouble with your
skin. This herbal balm, which is the product of years of
scientific research, has no equal as an antiseptic healer and
cure for obstinate skin diseases.
Zam-Buk is so refined that it is at once absorbed by the
pores of the skin. Impurities, poison and disease are drawn
out of the tissues, and new healthy skin is grown. So powerful
is Zam-Buk that the worst skin affection yields to its healing
influence.
To all who have a tendency to skin trouble of any sort
a daily dressing of Zam-Buk is of the utmost benefit. Never
use common ointments or pore-clogging cosmetics on a tender,
.troublesome skin. Their impure animal fats and minerals are
liable to set up irritation and inflammation.
The absolute safety, constant reliability and the wonder-
ful healing qualities of Zam-Buk make it a necessity in the
home. Every medicine chest should contain its box of
Zam-Buk.
TEST ZAM-BUK FREE.
Simply send your re-
quest, mentioning- Bulletin
27/9/’23, to C. E. Fulford

ful skin balm will be for-
warded by return mail.

Edward laughed, then sighed
* * * *
Beatrice Armytage sat in her very own
library, studying with her calm, cultured
blue eyes the statuette in pride of place. She
was very sad. Edward’s three months had
ended on the previous evening, and having
heard nothing of him her feminine intuition
told her that this morning he would return.
She did not reason it out, she just knew;
and true to intuition, Edward was announced
before lunch.
“Oh, Edward!” cried Beatrice dismally,
immediately she looked at him.
No wonder! His trousers were uncreased :
he had coarsened shockingly, and no longer
resembled a lily, though his face was rather
pale. He came- forward quietly.
“Well, I’ve done it, Beatrice.”
“What?” she said miserably.
“Worked,” he said, not without pride. “I
kept my word. I got a job at a garage, and
I’ve worked, and lived on the results of my
work, until yesterday—the stipulated day.
Beatrice!” His voice had in it a sudden note
of genuine pride. “Are you doubting my
word?”
“Oh, no, no, Edward ; no,” she said hur-
riedly. “I don’t at all”
“I began with enough to buy food and a
bed—nothing beside. Now this is the last
action in the pledge. I’ve come to you.
Good heavens!”
For the lily had forgotten her poise, and
had begun to cry. Edward hurried over to
her.
“What, Beatrice, what? It’s all right.
I’m here.”
“But —but,” she sobbed, “look at yourself,
Edward! There’s a smudge on your coat!
And your hands! Your hands /”
He looked at them. They were no longer
white. They were fairly clean, but the nails
were, were—they weren’t clean. They were
close cut and there were signs of grease in
them. And he was transformed otherwise : he
looked rough.
“I ca-an’t, Edward,” sobbed Beatrice. “I
—I didn’t promise—you did... . But I”
“What?” he cried.
“Oh, forgive me!” she moaned, “you know
I’m fond of you—but—but”
He closed his eyes.
“Does that mean, Beatrice, that you don’t
want to”
“I can’t; I can't.”
“Oh, then! O Jupiter! Oh, the....
Good-bye, Beatrice. O Lord !”
"F-forgive me. ... .He’s gone!” finished
Beatrice tragically.
She sat up and sighed ; then her gaze wan-
dered to the statuette in pride of place, and
she w r alked over and touched it gently.
H was called “Narcissus” and depicted the
idiot, not at the well, but standing in an
attitude of narrow-chested, ecstatic, esthetic,
languid admiration of himself, as though an
invisible mirror stood before him. Beatrice
smiled sweetly and stroked him.
Edward was travelling on winged feet and
slow trams to Northcote. He burst into the
garage, and nearly collided with Jerry Clin-
nack.
“Hallo!” exclaimed the latter.
“Where’s Pat?”
“In the office. What the” Jerry re-
mained witfi open mouth. Into the office
bounded Edward, and swept down upon the
writer at the desk.
“Back !” he shouted. “I’m back ! And I
can explain everything now, thank God!
Partners with your dad and the biggest
garage in Melbourne. And partners with
you, Pat!”
Pat struggled against his encircling arms.
“Sir! You’re forgetting yourself ! How
dare—oh, Ted, I thought it couldn’t be true
that you’d never come back. I”
But Patricia could say no more, for
Edward was. taking an emotional liberty with
her lips.
HARRY PAULL.
A Little Music.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\\T HEN Mrs. Smith invited Patricia
W 1 and me to spend the evening at her
house, she mentioned that we
would have a little music. We had it—
so little you might almost call it micro-
scopic. She also told Patricia to bring a
song, and Patricia obediently brought it,
leaving it concealed in her coat out in the
hall, as the custom is in our town, to be pro-
duced later to the accompaniment of blushes
and protestations from her, and playful scold-
ings from her hostess. Had she wished to
air her accomplishments, the alternative
course would have been to bring every song
she possessed, draw everyone’s attention
by apologies, explaining that she had not
had time to pick anything out, and had
brought them all just as they were. This
ensures requests for a great number of items,
and the artist feels that she is a Success.
Patricia, as I said, brought one song only,
hid it in the hall, and came with me into
the. drawing-room, where we found Miss
Smith, a stolid lass who scarcely ever spoke ;
Miss Smith’s young man, reputed to be a
trick, but in appearance very dull and emi-
nently suited to Miss Smith; and a visitor
from Melbourne, who was introduced to us
as Miss Alice Ramsay. Other guests arrived
soon after us; and Mrs. Smith immediately
launched her musical evening.
Miss Ramsay, aloof and a little absent in
her manner, seemed to feel that she had the
reputation of the metropolis to keep up, and
on being asked to play first, sat down at the
Piano with an air of assurance that was
quite professional. She began her perform-
ance by holding the sustaining pedal down
while she played preliminary chromatic
scales and broken chords, listening to the
resultant buzzing discord with apparent com-
placency. Then, suddenly, she pounced on
one unsuspecting note and thumped it vio-
lently, saying it was stiff. She removed her
bangles after this, looked down at the pedals,
blew her nose, and began to tell us
how long it was since she had prac-
tised. First, auntie got sick —she told us
all about auntie, and what the doctor said.
Then the maid left, and her hands got rough
with housework, until she began to use —
here she told us all the things she used,
sketching the histories of the persons who
had recommended each. After that her pet
dog died, and she felt she never wanted to
play again; but now, to please Mrs. Smith,
she would try some little thing, though some-
what at a disadvantage owing to the fore-
going mishaps. Whereupon she swung round
on the music-stool, and dashed off into a
seemingly interminable composition full of
racing-scale passages, glissandos and thump-
ing chords. She crossed her hands fre-
quently, a feat I have always admired, since
I first learnt to do it in, I think, “The Chapel
in the Mountains” many years ago. When
she finished, we were all breathless, bewil-
dered and almost deaf ; but we chorused our
thanks in a satisfactory manner.
It was a little hard on Miss Roberts to
be called on to play her piece immediately
after this display. In vain she protested
that she really couldn’t, she hadn’t practised
for months, she couldn’t remember when she
had touched the piano last. She began to
play, stumbled, stopped, said she should
never have begun it (which was true), be-
cause she really didn’t know it (which was
true also), and she gave us instead an ex-
haustive list of the music she used to play
—once.
After tinkering with the keys again Miss
Roberts decided, instead of playing anything
classical, to run through the score of “Sally.”
Changing her mind again, however, she sug-
gested playing the accompaniments of musi-
cal comedy, because it was always such rub-
bish ; and picking up a long and unfamiliar
song, she waded through the piano part from
first to last, three long verses, overloading
the simple accompaniment that had neither
melody nor meaning with pauses and senti-
ment and expression. When it was over we
said how, we enjoyed listening to something
we knew. We had begun to know it very
well.
When the tumult had subsided, Pat was
sent out for her song, which Miss Ramsay
took from her, remarking, “Oh, this is beau-
tiful ! I heard Evelyn Scotney sing it only
last week. It was wonderful! You know
what she would make of it.”
But Pat went on. I was proud of her. I
would never have had the nerve myself.
Miss Alice Ramsay seemed to have upset all
the soloists, who had relaxed throats, or bad
colds, or songs in keys either too high or too
low for them. And not one of them had prac-
tised. When Patricia’s song reached its
rather abrupt conclusion, Miss Smith’s young
man was heard remarking that there was
this about a gramophone—you could stop it
when you liked. My sister, nothing daunted,
began to play, and at the end of the piece
Miss Ramsay remarked that she had heard
Moiseiwitsch play the same thing quite re-
cently.
Mrs. Smith, fearing Pat’s feelings might be
hurt, hastened to say: “Never mind. Patty
did her best, and I’m sure she managed very
nicely. I always do like Gregg.’’
“Grigg, mother,” contradicted Miss Smith
explosively, breaking her long silence.
“It’s all one to me, dear,” replied her
mother placidly.
But Miss Ramsay stuck to her guns, refus-
ing- to be side-tracked. “I adore Moisei-
witsch,” she said. “When he played that
last piece we heard—well, I simply couldn’t
describe how he played it!”
She couldn’t either, but she kept on trying
for 10 minutes or more. After which she
sat down at the piano and began to play
the “Raindrop Prelude,” giving us little hints
as to its meaning as she went on.
“This is rain falling. What would you
think if you heard it drip-dripping on your
coffin?” she asked darkly.
“I’d think it was good for the crops,” said
Miss Smith’s young man, brightening up.
“You should have heard the storm last night.
There was a piece of iron loose on the roof,
and the row—worse’ll that!” lie concluded,
nodding at the piano.
“This is thunder,” said Miss Ramsay
acidly.
While I looked at the young man, think-
ing that, after all, lie was. as I had heard,
“a trick,” the pianist faded to a pianissimo,
and Mrs. Smith, thinking she was about to
stop, cried: “Go on. dear, go on. You
mustn’t mind us talking. We are listening
just the same. I remember you played this
pretty piece the last time the Bishop was
here, the dear Bishop in his lawn sleeves
and gaiters.”
Under cover of the next crescendo the
whole roomful began to talk louder and
louder, until, as Miss Alice dropped into a
soft passage with disconcerting suddenness,
Mrs. Smith was heard to shout at the top
of her voice: “I never eat sausages.”
The very room grew chill, and Miss
Ramsay finished her performance in a pro-
found and frozen silence.
Supper was a dull affair. The'music had
taken it out of us, and in consequence we
were all in that relaxed mood when we were
ready to say the wrong thing with the best
intentions in the world.
“Is it only 11?” exclaimed Patricia as we
said good night—“l thought it was muqh
later than that.”
“Never mind,” said Miss Smith’s young
man, who had been gazing into the eyes
of his lady as he said good-bye, “we are
going.”
“Yes.” said Mrs. Smith brightly as she
shook hands with the last guest. “Better
late than never. Good night all. Good
night.”
