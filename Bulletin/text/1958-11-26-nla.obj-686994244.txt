SPEECHES BY MENZIES
One of the most rewarding forms
of conversation you can have with any
man is to get him to tell you about his
trade. Whether it is making a shoe or
writing a sonnet, that is something he
knows and you. the listener, don’t. And
since R. G. Menzies’s trade is making
speeches, as an essential element in the
art of government, it really is very
interesting to have him giving away his
trade-secrets in one of the essays in
his Speech Is of Time (Cassell).
For instance, it was mildly surpris-
ing to this reviewer to hear Mr.
Menzies, during his policy-speech in
the late election, paying quite a hand-
some tribute to Mr. Calwell for his
services to immigration under Chifley
—not that one imagines that Mr.
Menzies, in his private capacity, would
not recognise all sorts of virtues in his
political opponents, but an election
seemed a surprising time to mention
them. But, turning to his essay on
“Politics as an Art,” which was first
printed in the New York “Times” in
1948, we find that praise for his
opponents —or, you could say, fair-
mindedness; or, you could further say,
an appearance of fair-mindedness—is
a recognised part of his technique:—
I think we discourage many people
from entering public life by our
absurd habit, not peculiar to any one
country, of seeking emphasis by
violence and exaggeration rather
than by the making of the fair con-
cession which renders the subse-
quent criticism so much more
effective. Plain people are more
likely to believe that your political
opponent is a decent fellow, like
themselves, but wrong on some great
issue, than that he is a consummate
rogue whose public errors are doubt-
less the product of a corrupt and
murky private life.
Mr. Menzies, of course, is not alone
in practising this technique—even book-
reviewers have been known to praise
a book a little, to show how fair-
minded they are, before they tear it
to pieces—and one does not make the
point to suggest that his praise for Mr.
Calwell was merely a piece of Mac-
chiavellian duplicity: only to indicate
that when he makes a speech he
thoroughly understands what he is
doing.
This is a minor point. A major
point in the same essay, because it
sums-up his understanding of the basis
of all speech-making, the right use of
language, is this:—
After all, the essence of a good
speech is that the speaker should
have something to say which he is
resolved to convey to his listeners in
the simplest, most intelligible and
most persuasive language. He must
command his own words and not be-
come their incoherent victim. The
search for elaboration rather than
simplicity is a mark of the second-
rate. Lucidity has always seemed to
me to be one of the cardinal virtues.
The occasional passages of noble
and moving English which have
flowered in the speeches of a Pitt, a
Lincoln, a Churchill, were the inevit-
able produce of sincerity, originality
of mind and deep emotion. They
cannot be forced without being
destroyed. They certainly cannot be
imitated.
The most interesting point in this
paragraph, apart from its obvious good
sense, is that Mr. Menzies recognises
that the great heights of Lincoln’s and
Churchill's speeches, which are always
heights of inspired simplicity, of basic,
Anglo-Saxon vocabulaiy, “cannot be
imitated.” And very wisely, in the 16
speeches and essays printed in this
book, he does not try to imitate them.
Mr. Menzies’s own style is not
Churchillian but, essentially, Gib-
bonian. It is the Latin word rather than
the Anglo-Saxon which he usually finds
most suitable for his purposes; a result,
very likely, of his long training in the
law, and of something old-Roman in
his temperament. Written or spoken,
his prose is the “grand style” in
English, modified a little by his
search for simplicity. If it is not a
rugged Anglo-Saxon it is better than
any fake simplicity. It is a style that
must always exist to counterbalance
the excessive crudity into which the
language, without it, might fall; and
it has its own distinct qualities of
elegance, cadence and that “cardinal
virtue” of lucidity.
The way Mr. Menzies brings it down
to earth when actually speaking in
public is, of course, to jump on his
interjectors from time to time in very
plain Anglo-Saxon; or, rather, plain
Australian. In the printed version of
the speeches that is not possible; but
they are a good deal lightened by his
wit and everywhere invigorated by the
phenomenon of clear thought clearly
expressed. Oddly enough, considering
Mr. Menzies’s reputation as an orator,
the speeches read even better than
they sound: one is not so much aware
of the conscious artistry of his oratori-
cal method, and consequently is more
aware of the plain good sense of his
matter: the sincerity and responsibility
of his opinions, the logical consistency
of his viewpoint.
“Speech Is of Time” is, indeed, a
remarkably consistent book. It is the
clearest picture this reviewer has yet
seen of Mr. Menzies’s line of thought,
and the line, though Mr. Menzies can
see all sides of an argument as well as
anyone, never loses direction.
There are, first, a set of speeches
emphasising the necessity for Australia
to maintain its intimate relationship
with the Crown, with Great Britain
and the Commonwealth; partly on
grounds of prudence, so that the world
shall not split-up into two great camps
—the U.S. versus the Soviet —with the
Commonwealth powerless to intervene;
partly on spiritual grounds, because
that is where our civilisation comes
from.
That outlook, on the level of
prudence and practical necessity, leads
logically to the set of speeches in which
Mr. Menzies supported Great Britain in
the Suez Affair; and on the spiritual
level it leads with the same consist-
ency to the final set of speeches dealing
with the humanities: the continuance
and broadening of that civilisation we
have brought with us from Great
Britain:—
As we look forward, therefore, we
are not to allow our education of
new generations to be distorted.
More scientists; more scholars;
more scholarly scientists; more
scientific scholars; more historians
and philosophers and poets. For if
science is truly to serve the cause of
civilisation it will be because the
people who use the advances of
science have grown to use them in a
civilised way.
Though, of course, everyone will
want to agree or disagree with Mr.
Menzies’s opinions, it would be a pity
to approach this book merely from a
political angle. It is the expression of
a distinguished mind in clear and dis-
tinguished prose, and we should be
pleased to be reminded that we have
in this country speeches so well worth
printing.

It is interesting, in The Memoirs of
Field-Marshal Montgomery (Collins),
to see him assessing, not unconscious
of a modern comparison, Moses. Crom-

A WISE VERDICT
'T'HE Menzies Government at the
A elections on Saturday won a
most refreshing victory throughout the
Commonwealth. It confounded all the
critics and croakers and the poll-
takers on whose analysis of marginal
seats a week before the vote Sydney
“Herald” deduced, with shrill joy, a
substantial drift to the Left and a Labor
victory.
Mr. Menzies offered nothing except a
more uncertain economic prospect
ahead, which everybody with a grain of
commonsense knows must be coming
following the fall in wool prices and
shrinkage of world trade. He had
nothing to give the electors except
realities, and he did not try to wrap
them up in Santa Claus paper.
It is a fine tribute to the good sense
of Australian public opinion and to
the confidence which the Government
has inspired during its nine years of
unspectacular facing of hard facts that
its sober programme was preferred to
that of the meretricious and shop-worn
fragment which calls itself a “Labor”
party, backed in the most astonishing
circumstances by Sydney “Herald.”
Mortgaged to the Communist-led
unions (some of which conducted a
nationwide campaign on its behalf),
divided in itself. Labor is scarcely its
own master any more. Most of its
members are not Labor men at all but
careerists, some of them more than
comfortable financially. They went into
the campaign with their platform con-
cealed and their pledge to introduce
socialisation (the one and only objec-
tive of the party, signed by every
candidate if the party rules were
obeyed) an ostensible dead-letter.
All the time Dr. Evatt was in the
limelight his hands and feet deceived
the eye.
He had created the Democratic
Labor party schism out of his own
need for a red-herring when the Petrov
commission advertised his attitude
towards Communism, and he lambasted
it with abuse which split the party in
bits. Now he suddenly offered himself
as a sacrifice to the Democrats and
promised to allow them to lead him to
the block in the moment of victory and
presumably choose a successor to him.
That having been rejected—the
Democrats having decided to take him
to the slaughter in their own way—he
abused them as traitors to Labor
because they were giving their prefer-
ences to the Menzies Government,
while that was exactly what his own
party was doing in at least 17 out of 33
electorates in Victoria. And having for
years maintained that the lay organisa-
tions of the Roman Catholic Church
had been involved in a conspiracy to
take-over and subvert the Labor party,
he suddenly turned round and sought
the support of the Catholic vote, thus
highlighting the issue of sectarianism in
a clumsy fashion.
Moreover, having failed to set his
face against the unity-tickets of the
A.L.P. and Communist-party sup-
porters; having failed, as a bright light
of “liberalism,” to say one word in
condemnation of the martyrdom by
Communist union-leaders of the two
Hurseys because they would not pay a
political levy to a party they detested;
having all his political life been found in
the vanguard of their backers whenever
the Communist party needed a helping
hand, he turned-up in the last days of
the campaign as a staunch anti-
communist, sounding as if he had never
written a letter to Molotov in his life
or co-operated in brotherly accord with
the Communists to destroy the Petrov
commission.
VET this did not lead him to depre-
cate in public the collection of
funds by unions with a mixed A.L.P.-
Communist bag of leaders for division
between A.L.P. and Communist-party
campaign-funds.
Nor did it inhibit his determination,
if elected, to destroy the officially
supervised union-ballots which have
cleared so many unions of a subversive
leadership implementing Moscow’s
policy.
The “positive” Evatt policy, as sum-
marised in the last days of the cam-
paign. boiled-down to a list of
“takes” designed to “produce happier
tomorrows”:—
Mark the ballot paper for your elec-
torate exactly as shown below and
ensure FOR WIVES AND MOTHERS:
Maternity allowances doubled: Child
endowment nearly doubled. Free dental
treatment for children up to 16. FOR
THE SICK AND AGED: Pensions to be
raised to £4 17s. 6d.; wives’ allowance
to £2 10s. Od. FOR WIDOWS: All
pensions increased by 15s. FOR YOUNG
COUPLES: Financial aid for home-pur-
chasing; Marriage loans to help furnish-
ing; Abolition of Sales Tax on essential
furniture. FOR ALL: Lower interest
rates on hire purchase. FOR EX-
SERVICEMEN: Pensions raised to
£4 17s. 6d.; Wives’ allowance to
£2 10s. Od. Minimum T.P.I. pension
to be basic wage.
The outcome was an increase in
Government majority in the House of
Representatives at least by two seats,
possibly more, when the doubtfuls are
counted, together with a majority in the
Senate. This will assure the Govern-
ment of full control of legislation after
July. 1959.
The vote has also produced complete
discrediting of Dr. Evatt’s leadership
by his fourth defeat, the current one a
debacle beyond anything Labor has
ever suffered before, with its vote down
to 42 per cent, (compared with 45.8 p.c.
last time) after the first two days’
counting of the Lower House poll.
It is unlikely that anybody wants Dr.
Evatt as leader any more except the
Liberal-Country party (which has never
had so useful an opponent in Opposi-
tion), Dr. Evatt himself. Mr. Calwell
(tongue in cheek, having long been in
the habit of abusing him to anybody
who would listen) and Sydney “Herald,”
which thinks him a “bonny fighter.”
T'HE Government’s victory does not
ensure a serene future for it. It has
to meet a difficult economic situation
with a large deficit in overseas trading, a
big cut in its overseas balances and a
large slice of low-interest loans due for
redemption. Also, it has in front of it
the prospect that the time-lag in shrink-
age of taxation intake will catch up
with the Treasury next June, but not
contemporaneous relief from tax-
refunds for the last really buoyant
year.
Moreover, its majority can be an
embarrassment to it, especially at a
juncture which calls for large replace-
ments in the senior Cabinet, including
the Treasury, which has lost the politi-
cal acumen of Sir Arthur Fadden,
whose successor will bear the full brunt
and burden of the reconstruction period
under the critical eyes of an increas-
ingly experienced back-bench hungry
for office.
It is in the coming three years, with
all its important financial and Consti-
tutional and foreign-relations problems,
that the rightful place of the Menzies
Government in history will really be
established. It will depend to a very
large extent how the leader handles his
overwhelming majority, unchecked in
his measures by the proper brake of a
strong Opposition.
More than anything else Australia
will need a solid front to meet the
conditions caused by the recession in
world markets, even if it is temporary,
and the growing arrogance of Com-
munism and its stooges in Asia and
Africa.


"GET A BAG!"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Sectarianism in Politics
For the first time religion last week
became a public issue in Federal politics
when Dr. Evatt, after crying “Sectarian-
ism” for three years at the D.L.P.,
appealed to the rank-and-file of that party
to give Labor their second preferences.
In full-page newspaper advertisements
the A.L.P. called on D.L.P. voters to
“examine their consciences” on the ques-
tion of their No. 2 vote. The advertise-
ment quoted the “Catholic Weekly” as
warning the D.L.P. that in seeking to
keep the A.L.P. out of office it was ‘ pre-
venting a series of injportant social
policies” which it was itself advocating.
It also quoted Cardinal Gilroy:
Christian citizens are free in conscience
to join or support any of the politicial
parties represented in our public life except
the Communist party.
On Thursday the Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Melbourne, Dr. Mannix,
issued a statement in which he said that
“Every Communist and Communist sym-
pathiser in Australia wants a victory for
the Evatt party.” - Referring to the
A.L.P.’s use of Cardinal Gilroy’s name,
he reminded Roman Catholics that 34-
years ago the Cardinal wrote, and all
the bishops signed, a national pastoral
letter warning of the threat of Commun-
ism, which said, in part:
It is regrettable that highly placed public
men, including some Catholics, seem to
have closed their eyes to the great issues
involved in the present upheaval. They do
not appear to realise that they are for-
warding the interests of Communism.
Archbishop Mannix said it seemed to
him timely to recall those “calm and
weighty words.” His message was a direct
appeal to D.L.P. voters not to give their
second preferences to the A.L.P.
Leading Roman Catholic Labor men
—Arthur Calwell and Senator McKenna
explained that the Archbishop’s
remarks should be taken merely as his
personal political opinion, and the Roman
Catholic Archbishops of Adelaide and
Brisbane expressed similar views to those
of Cardinal Gilroy; though Archbishop
Duhig qualified his remarks with, “It is
generally believed that the Communists
and Communist sympathisers want a
victory of the Australian Labor party.”
Whether influenced or not by these
episcopal messages, it is to be hoped that
Roman Catholics and Protestants voted
according to their consciences on Satur-
day.
Dr. Evatt’s outburst on Sunday about
“the Menzies-Mannix axis” was a little
astounding,' even for the astounding
A.L.P. leader. His reference to the state-
ment being deliberately timed so as to
be too late for Labor to make an adequate
reply seems to overlook the fact that Dr.
Mannix spoke in reply to the A.L.P.’s
use of Cardinal Gilroy’s name on the
previous day.
The timing seems to have been
arranged by Dr. Evatt.
Official Flower
Victoria has chosen the pink variety of
common heath as the State official flower
and is the only State with a gazetted
and proclaimed official flower. The
ungazetted State flowers are W.A.,
kangaroo-paw ; N.S.W., waratah ; Tas-
mania, bluegum; S.A., Sturt’s desert
pea ; and Queensland, poinsettia (imp.).
But, although they haven’t been churched,
some authorities regard them as all better
than the official Victorian flower. The
ungazetted Commonwealth flower is the
golden wattle.
The official announcement from the
Victorian Premier’s office claimed that
the variety is found in Victoria but not
elsewhere. This is inaccurate. It grows
in some parts of N.S.W., in Tasmania
and S.A. According to advice to The
Bulletin from the National Herbarium
in the Royal Melbourne Botanical
Gardens it was cultivated 100 years ago
in London’s Kew Gardens, and also in
Italy.
The flower does grow most plentifully
in Victoria, of course, thriving on
moisture, shelter and shade, particularly
in Gippsland and the Grampians.
The other claims for the pink heath
are accurate; it grows naturally in a
wild state, is readily cultivated in parks
and gardens, is well known and popular,
isn't entirely a foliage plant, lasts well
as a cut flower, isn’t harmful to health
and blooms during a national holiday,
Queen’s Birthday.
The Pilots' Strike
The strike plans of the pilots of the
Australian airlines have been a shock to
the public. Pilots aren’t men on the
breadline, or thickheaded laborers who
could be excused for falling under the
spells of Communist agitators. They are
educated men, highly skilled, privileged
and respected, earning the salaries of
general-managers of large businesses and
chief-engineers of considerable factories.
But their responsibilities —admittedly con-
siderable —don’t end when they leave
their aircraft. They have social and politi-
cal responsibilities as well.
Their futures are assured. They are
noTfighting for anything really essential,
but only for cream on slices of bread-
and-jam.
Yet with irresponsible precipitancy
they have plunged into a series of rolling
strikes, planned according to a well-
known Communist technique, in order to
force the companies to give way. They
have done this knowing that their action
must cause disturbance in the minds of
the flying public ; that it must dislocate
business and pleasure alike at one of the
seasons of the year when there is most
movement.
They made their first move during an
election campaign with an airline on
which civil servants and Parliamentary
candidates and members fly in large'
numbers. And they have defied the order
of the Arbitration Court and sought, by
organised pressure, to have their griev-
ances dealt with by a tribunal of their
own choosing.
It must be admitted that airline pilots
in Australia receive smaller salaries and
haven’t the same conditions as those in
some other countries, but they are better
paid, having regard to the increasing
safety of aircraft and the development
of automatic devices, than, say, the
captains of ships whose responsibility
never ceases for days and nights together.
They do not have to face the crowded air
and the more hazardous climates of the
northern continents.
All airlines in Australia, official and
private, are going through a period of
reconstruction and development calling
for vast expenditures of capital and a
complete make-over of the types of air-
craft in use to more modern and faster
ones.
The entry into the business of these
new types is bound to call for a re-
assessment of pilots’ qualifications and
remuneration, but agitation and strikes
which cost the companies enormous
sums in a few weeks, and in some cases
heavy loss of trade to overseas con-
cerns where they affect trans-ocean
traffic, is scarcely likely to accelerate the
growth of the industry and improve the
reputation and usefulness of the air-crew
services.
The Creeping Red Pest
Events over a wide area in the world
show the creeping and limpet nature of
Communism and how it clogs govern-
ment, disturbs the peace, breaks down
svstems from within, and confuses more
completely the muddled mind.
In Iraq, across the Indian Ocean, the
Communists, supposedly underground,
were loudly extolling the decision of a
rough-and-ready military court to hang
a former Prime Minister and a Foreign
Secretary who had been the devoted
friends of the West for years, on
shadowy hearsay charges of plotting to
undermine the Government of Syria,
part of Nasser’s Federated Arab Republic
—this at a moment when a Government
like Nasser’s had taken the Sudan out
of the hands of a constitutionally-seated
Ministry, possibly, from its announce-
ments, as the result of Nasser’s own con-
spiracies.
The pattern all round the East has been
the same immature colonies turned
into “nations” under pressure from
Washington and the United Nations;
then left to become the prey of military
dictatorships under the finger of Com-
munist tutors and urgers, or rescued
from Communist-actuated revolution by
military dictatorships as in Siam, Burma
and Pakistan., -
At the same time Persia has been com-
pelled to send the Soviet Union a short,
sharp note about its persistent under-
mining of the country’s sovereignty and
the sowing of discontent among the tribes
of the north.
The spotlight has also fallen on Berlin,
where the Russians are playing a very
cunning game. They have suddenly
decided to “end the occupation” by
accepting the theory that the whole city
is part of East Germany. The plan seems


[For election matter in this issue requiring
signature, David Adams, of 252 George Street,
Sydney, is responsible.]
to be for the East Germans to accept
this theory, reorganising history to make
it appear that the city and Germany east
of the Elbe has been Russian, and that
Britain, United States and France have
been managing the western zones of
Berlin merely as the delegates of the
Moscow owners.
This, Moscow claims, entitles it to do
what it likes with the whole city and make
a present of it to the East German Gov-
ernment, which would take over the
Tempelhof and prevent Allied aircraft
breaking a blockade.
It seems a little bewildering, but it is
no more so than the inconsistencies so
apparent in other places and particularly
in respect of the Australian Labor Party
and its attendant unions in which, seem-
ingly, the Communists are punishing with
ruin men who will not subscribe to the
funds of the A.L.P., which professes —at
election-time —to hate them.
Is This Our Future?
In “Has Mankind a Future?” —his third
and last Dyason lecture in Sydney —
.Kingsley Martin continued in the mood
of his second lecture.
Mankind, he said, was faced with two
great threats: overpopulation and nuclear
destruction.
If world population continued to grow
at its present alarming rate in relation
to food resources, democracy would in
time become unworkable (he contended)*
Supply and consumption of food would
have to be tightly controlled, and indi-
vidual freedom restricted in the interests
of survival.
Science though it had helped to
create this problem by lowering the
deathrate without at the same time pro-
viding the means for lowering the birth-
rate —may relieve some of the pressure
by increasing the means of subsistence ;
but what was needed most urgently was
a cheap, simple and easily accessible
method of birth-control for the back-
ward and overpopulated parts of the
world.
The most immediate threat was that
of nuclear destruction.
This could be to a large extent lessened
by having as few countries as possible
in possession of nuclear weapons ; by
keeping as many countries as possible
uncommitted to either side in the struggle
between America and Russia (the theme
of Mr. Martin’s second lecture); and
by controlling nuclear tests.
International control of nuclear
activity seemed imperative. If every
country, large and small, had nuclear
weapons, the world would never be safe
from the threat of total destruction.
Generally speaking, survival was a
question of facing what was inevitable,
and adapting ourselves to it.
Those who sought to preserve a
status quo were misguided, for there was
no such thing as a status quo in the world
today. The world was constantly in flux,
inevitably changing.
One inevitable change, contended
Mr. Martin, was the end of
white supremacy. White supremacy-
said Mr. Martin —had been based on
nothing more than superior technical and
scientific knowledge. The colored races
now had access to this knowledge and
would soon be equal in every way to the
whites. Complete integration would then
be almost certain (added Mr. Martin).
Mr. Martin was not, however, pessi-
mistic.
Both America 'and Russia seemed
anxious to avoid nuclear war ; and the
only real danger of it was that one of
them, by committing itself to an unreal
position, as the Americans had done on
Quemoy and Matsu, would put itself in
a position where it must either go to
war or lose face. If this did not happen,
there was a very good chance indeed
that mankind would find peaceful solu-
tions to its problems.
Shares on T.-p.
A movement which could do with study
by Australian major companies troubled
with employee-relations is that fostered
by the institution which calls itself Aims
of Industry in the United Kingdom.
One of its projects is to further indus-
trial peace by a union of the employing
and employee classes through share-
ownership by the latter.
The A.0.1.’s idea is to sell ordinary
shares in companies outside the pay-
office, and in this plan they are interesting
the hire-purchase firms.
Two of these in a large way—Bow-
maker and the Franco-British and
General Trust —have come into the field
with schemes which are likely to cause
unease in England both among unit-trusts
and on the Stock Exchange —or will if
the plan becomes popular.
The idea is that the finance companies
will advance up to 75 p.c. of the cost of
shares, plus fees and stamp-duty, and
charge an effective 9 per cent, to 10 per
cent., less tax. Loans will be for terms up
to two years.
The new shareholder will be subject
to an undertaking that shares will not be
sold until three months after purchase.
Some of the English banks, notably
Lloyds, have already made plans to help
widen the ownership of shares, but their
machinery, for the job is imperfect except
where they are associated with h.-p.
houses.
The Bowmaker scheme can be used to
help employees of private companies
whose proprietors wish to allow them into
the investment.
It is an idea that could be looked at
in Canberra and in large-scale industry
in which shares have solid backing and
offer a chance to the employees to buy
modestly and gain both through divi-
dends and expansion of capital.
The Labor party, of course, will' not
welcome it any more than it welcomes
bonuses and profit-sharing. It is a scheme
that tends to create “little capitalists”
and militate against nationalisation, as
well as giving employees a constructive
interest in private enterprise and the
progress of companies they work for.
That is~ the last thing a Socialist
politician wants to encourage.
Entertainment Expenses
It is commonly asserted that many
executives of “big business” live on their
untaxed expense-accounts, which fre-
quently are stated to include luxurious
homes (for “entertainment of visitors
and customers”), cars (operated on the
“company’s transport costs”), and lush
meals in city pubs.
Many of these stories may be untrue.
Yet the question of expense-accounts
for entertaining is a vexed one for bosses
and employees alike, and some phases
of it, arising from the disallowed claim
by the general-secretary of a trade-union
that his costs under that heading should
be an allowable tax-deduction, have
recently been probed by the No. 3 taxa-
tion board-of-review in Brisbane. The
board in this case upheld the Tax Com-
missioner. Its findings, of interest to the
disappointed taxpayer, will also have
aspects of importance for others as well
as administrators of unions.
The union-secretary concerned spent
money entertaining members of his
union (when they called to see him to
discuss aspects of their employment) and
also members of the legal profession.
The commissioner allowed £6 under the
latter head, although at the board-of-
review’s inquiry the department’s repre-
sentative said it was not considered
allowable.
On the entertainment of union-
members, the taxpayer claimed the
expense was necessary for the produc-
tion of his assessable income. He said
he was paid by salary only, and that his
initial, appointment had been for a term
of three years. When the return was
lodged he was still in the initial term, and
he considered it necessary to “foster the
goodwill of members by entertaining
them”; he felt his subsequent appoint-
ment by the triennial conference might
have been affected if he had not so enter-
tained them.
Before he accepted reappointment he
intimated to the conference that he was
losing money -by entertaining members
of the union and the public, and there-
fore he wanted a substantial rise in
salary—which he got. He was voted
back to office “almost unanimously.”
The board-of-review held that the
relevant expenditure was not incurred in
gaining or producing the assessable in-
come of the relevant year. The tax-
payer was regarded not as one carrying
on a business but as an employee, and
the board, through its member, Mr. J.
F. McCaffrey, explained that only in
continuing businesses could expenditure
designed to produce income in a future
year be allowed as a deduction in the
year in which it was incurred.
It looks as though the members of the
union will find their general-secretary
less inclined to invite them across the
road during any future visits to the
union office. A good many firms and
employees may also take a second look
at their entertainment-allowances.

Heaven to know why the local Caledonian

metamorphosis occurred. First I found
that by concentrating it is possible to
distinguish a tuning-up from an air ; and
that instruments which have been capable
of inciting Scots for generations to rush
into battle and belt their opponents with
knobkerries and haggises could, if
listened-to from a distance (as when the
band marched up and down the long
park), take on quite a soporific quality.

ITS STORY, ITS METHODS
The House That Lloyd Built
By ROBERT G. MONTGOMERY
Today, nearly 300 years
after its curious begin-
ning, L 1 o y d’s, of
London, is a vast inter-
national firm, known the world
over. But is was not always
so, and its history, from a
small band of British mer-
chants to its present size, has
been remarkable indeed.
It was in 1688, in a narrow,
cobblestoned street not far
from the Tower of London,
that Edward Lloyd’s coffee-
house opened for business.
Above the panelled window
the shingle, with its two long-
stemmed pipes and large
coffee-pot, beckoned passers-
by in for a refreshing cup.
Merchants from the sur-
rounding business - houses
found the quiet coffee-house,
with its genteel service and
dignified air, an ideal retreat,
an excellent rendezvous for
their business transactions.
Their patronage prompted
Edward Lloyd to invest some
of his profits in a little reno-
vation.
He installed boxes, or
cubicles, in which two or three
people could comfortably and
privately transact their busi-
ness while drinking coffee, and
he provided paper, quill-pens
and ink in an effort to attract
men from the nearby marine-
insurance business. It was a
successful venture: soon the
Lombard Street coffee-house
became a popular centre for
the sale of ships and wines.
In a further move of expan-
sion he began, in 1696, the
publication of “Lloyd’s News,”
containing shippings news
and information. Customers
poured into the coffee-house.
To cope with the business he
put on uniformed waiters.
Coon the coffee-house became
the natural clearing-house
for information on all marine-
insurance matters. Merchants
willing to shoulder proportions
of a marine-risk would sign
their names one under another
on a policy, and so became
known as “underwriters.”
Edward Lloyd died in 1713,
but the coffee-house continued
under his successors, one of
whom, Thomas Jemson, was
largely responsible for the
introduction, in 1734, of
“Lloyd’s List,” which is still
published.
In the 1750’s “Lloyd’s Regis-
ter of Shipping” appeared, the
earliest number to survive
being the biennial issue for
1764-66.
It was not until 1774 that
the underwriters eventually
formed their own association,
with offices in the Royal
Exchange. In honor of the
proprietor of the old coffee-
house they named it Lloyd’s,
of London.
Lloyd’s continued to flourish,
and in spite of, or more prob-
ably because of, the hazards of
the Napoleonic wars it con-
solidated its reputation for
solvency, courage and integrity.
In 1799 the British frigate
“That Was the biggest shark I ever saw!”
Lutine was lost off the Dutch
coast. With it went a huge
fortune in gold, consigned to
Hamburg and the British
troops in the Netherlands.
Had Lloyd’s, which had
insured the cargo, been unable
to meet this colossal claim
many would have sympathised.
Instead, Lloyd’s calmly noti-
fied the Admiralty that an
equivalent amount of gold was
ready for shipment, and
requested delivery instructions!
r ¥~'HE experience gained over
the years and the deter-
mination to remain at all times
calm and unshaken unquestion-
ably enabled Lloyd’s to come
through its longest, toughest
and costliest trial —World
War 11.
Not only did it pay out a
tremendous amount in marine-
insurance claims —very few
know exactly how much, and
it is just possible underwriting
was a little in the red at times
—but it successfully survived
the Battle of Britain and all
the bombings. As might have
been expected, the entire staff,
on hearing the alarm, quietly
and quickly moved into the
company’s underground shel-
ters and within 10 minutes
resumed business.
Lloyd’s will insure against
just about any type of risk you
care to nominate, from the
arrival of baldness or bad
weather to the loss of a luxury-
liner or a movie-star’s legs.
Get into big insurance, such
as steamships, buildings, con-
struction-works, cargoes or the
like, and Lloyd’s will cover
the risks. The San Fratrcisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge, to quote
just one example, has been
insured at Lloyd’s for $5O mil-
lion against collapse and other
hazards.
"JC'ever once in its history has
a member of Lloyds
repudiated a legitimate claim
on any one of its policies.
Though the world is well
aware of the huge risks
Lloyd’s takes, few people not
connected with the insurance-
business realise why it can con-
tinue to survive batterings that
would quickly overwhelm
many other insurance com-
panies.
The secret is that, as a
corporation, Lloyd’s does not
actually issue any insurance at
all. For Lloyd’s is in reality
an exclusive association whose
4000-odd members pledge
their entire personal fortunes
to meet their share of any
claims that could be made on
a policy bearing Lloyd’s name.
Hence, many members might
each lose a little on a particu-
lar claim rather than a few
individuals having to sustain a
heavy loss. As one of Lloyd’s
members observed: “Individu-
ally we are underwriters;
collectively we are Lloyd’s.”
You don’t get insurance from
Lloyd’s, you get it at Lloyd’9
—and that makes all the
difference.
A ll business transactions at
-f*- Lloyd’s are conducted in
the crowded main hall, known
as The Room.
Each day accredited brokers
noisily invade The Room with
slips of stiff paper setting-out
the endless variety of risks they
will invite Lloyd’s members to
underwrite. Each underwriter
is a member of a syndicate
which may or may not
specialise in some particular
type of insurance.
The brokers hurry from one
underwriter to another until
the policy is covered, with
sometimes dozens of syndicates
each covering a portion of the
policy. The proposal may be
a trivial one or a million-risk,
yet each is presented on the
time-honored slip of stiff paper.
Underwriters may retire to
one of Lloyd’s quiet rooms to
consider a proposal before
committing themselves, but
frequently snap decisions
involving perhaps millions of
pounds are made on the spot
by the underwriter merely
scrawling on the slip of paper
the amount he will cover, the
rate and his initials. Once a
syndicate has accepted a risk
it “reinsures” the risk with
other syndicates, each of which
in turn may do the same, thus
reducing the large initial risk
into many smaller, less-
“deadly” ones.
“The underwriters are the
wo r 1 d’s most confirmed
optimists,” wrote a visiting
American journalist. “They
thrive on the unshakeable con-
viction that everything will be
all right.” In The Room one
might well assume that the
customer is always wrong.
Undoubtedly many of Lloyd’s
policies have been gambles,
and there must have been some
pretty solid losses, but by and
large the gambles have been
profitable. The income from

Saturday “Mother’s Day,” the people of
Australia have again decided that Bob’s
their uncle.
• •
Almost from the outset of the count-
ing on Saturday night it was obvious that
the Government was not in danger, and
though it seemed early in the count that
it might lose a couple of seats there were
also at that stage compensating gains.
By midnight things had sorted them-
selves out more. Phillip and Hume,
which on early figures looked ominous
for two Government members, seemed
safe ; Barton and Parkes, claimed as
Government wins halfway through the
evening, looked like staying with Labor.
• •
At that stage, after making allowance
for D.L.P. and Q.L.P. preferences, only
three Government seats seemed at all
in danger. These were St. George
(N.S.W.), Maribyrnong (Vic.) and
Braddon (Tas.). Labor seats threatened
were Brisbane, Herbert, Griffith and
Leichhardt (all in Queensland) and
Stirling (W.A.).
Sunday's count improved the A.L.P.
position in Barton and Parkes; in St.
George sitting Liberal member Bruce
Graham slipped further behind. Mari-
byrnong and Braddon began to look safe
for their Liberal holders, and Labor
veteran George Lawson seemed to have
weathered the storm in Brisbane. Herbert
and Griffith looked like definite Govern-
ment gains; Leichhardt and Stirling
were still open.
• •
Counting in the doubtful seats will not
be completed before the end of the week,
but it seems that the Government will
have at least as many seats as it held
in the old Parliament (75) and possibly
one or two more. To hold St. George
and Maribyrnong it will have to improve
on its present count. A similar improve-
ment could give it Stirling and Leich-
hardt. All these seats will depend on
distribution of preferences.
• •
Seats that may change hands without
affecting the Government’s total are Indi
and Wimmera in Victoria, and Moore in
W.A. In the first two the sitting Liberal
members Bostock and Lawrence have
Country-party opponents who have polled
well and may fight-out the final count
when D.L.P. and A.L.P. candidates are
eliminated. In Moore, Country-party
member Leslie is opposed by a Liberal,
and the decision will depend on A.L.P.
preferences.
• •
Although the Senate counting will drift
on until well into next week it can be
taken for granted that the Government
has won control of the Upper House ;
Westralia has given it the 3-2 result
needed to achieve this. It also seems
likely that the Government will win 3-2
in Queensland ; on Monday its team was
well ahead of the A.L.P. trio and Senator
Byrne and his Q.L.P. colleagues were
considerably short of a quota. Dr. Evatt’s
offer of exchange of preferences with the
D.L.P. apparently didn’t extend to the
Q.L.P. Senate team. Labor’s official card
placed the Government Senate team
above the Q.L.P., thereby ensuring the
defeat of Senator Byrne.
• •
Senator Cole (D.L.P.) seems likely to
retain his seat in Tasmania, with the
Liberals and the A.L.P. each winning
two seats. The D.L.P. also has a chance
of picking-up a Senate seat in Victoria,
though it will be touch and go between
its candidate and the third Government
man. The N.S.W. result will be 3-3 and
the South Australian 3-2 in favor of the
A.L.P.
The most likely state of the new
Senate will be Government, 31 ; A.L.P.,
26 ; D.L.P., 3. Any change on that
would be in favor of the Government at
the expense of the D.L.P.

A while back in the quarterly
“Southerly,” N. S. Wales Liberal party’s
public-relations man, Edgar Holt, a
former leader-writer, disparaged the
power of present-day leading-articles to
influence public opinion. Some think
Sydney “Herald’s” pro-Evatt campaign
proves this ; others say that it was not a
fairly conducted test —if the “Herald”
had attacked Evatt they might have done
much better for him.
“Who are the condolences from, Bert? Elliott V. Elliott, Molotov or
‘Granny Herald'?”


Trams ran past the Bulletin office
for the last time on Saturday; buses have
now replaced the old rattlers in George
Street, and the place is so quiet that it
would be possible to hear the chimes
of the G.P.O. clock if the authorities
hadn’t taken it away during the war and
forgotten to bring it back.
• •
Resignations shook the organisations
of political parties in three Sydney
electorates in the closing days of the
election campaign. F. W- Turner, chair-
man of the Parkes electorate conference
of the Liberal party, resigned from his
position and also from the State council
(though not from the party) in protest
against Federal Government policy. On
the same day, next-door to Parkes, in
St. George, K. Harcombe, acting-secre-
tary of the Kingsgrove branch of the
A.L.P., resigned from the party because
of “the complete duplicity of the A.L.P.
over unity-tickets with the Communists.”
The third dissident, John O’Grady,
endorsed A.L.P. candidate for Lane Cove
at the next State election, didn’t merely
hand in his Labor chips. Saying that he
had been sickened by Dr. Evatt’s appeal
that morning to the Catholic voter and
found himself unable to reconcile Evatt’s
past and present actions on the Catholic
issue, he took-out a D.L.P. ticket.

Bolte doesn’t intend to follow the
N. S. Wales example and permit twilight
race-meetings. He believes “it would
interfere with other forms of entertain-
ment and recreation that normally take
place round this time.” It’s nice to come
across a modern politician with some
respect for old traditions. The gloamin’s
for roamin’ in, not for racin’ in.
• •
Hotel-bars were closed in N. S. Wales
all day on Saturday, although the polling-
booths closed at 8 p.m., two hours before
normal closing-time for the pubs. The
idea behind a dry election-day is com-
plex. It’s partly to stop drunken brawls
arising out of political arguments ; partly
to avoid vote-buying by shouting ; partly
to ensure that a sober vote is cast. As to
the last of these, the high percentage of
informal votes suggests that some sober
electors couldn’t be more befuddled if
they were drunk.
• •
In the Vic. Legislative Council
Country-party and Labor members voted
together to defeat Bolte’s Local Govern-
ment Bill, which proposed to take local-
government away from the Public Works
Department and place it under a separ-
ate Minister. Tactics adopted were to
move and carry an amendment bring-
ing the Country Roads Board under the
same Minister. Bolte said he had told
both parties that if it was found desir-
able later on to include the board in the
new portfolio this might be done; despite
this they had preferred to defeat the
bill. He complained that the move
infringed the right of the Premier to
allot portfolios and flouted the wishes of
the electors—in his policy-speech last
May he promised a separate Ministry of
Local Government.
Fears are now expressed for the fate
of the Bread Bill when it reaches the
Council.

Deputy Prime Minister and Country-
party leader McEwen said at the end of
his campaign tour that the most signifi-
cant thing he had noticed from Perth
to Cairns was the complete absence of
vocal support for the A.L.P. On all his
previous electioneering tours at least
some A.L.P. enthusiasts had shown-up at
his meetings; this time, none. Unlike
McEwen, Menzies couldn’t say his meet-
ings were uninterrupted. But it is doubt-
ful whether the A.L.P. would care to
claim the really rowdy element at Bob’s
meetings, however much it might appre-
ciate their services.

Back in the Westralian Cabinet after
a break of over eight years, former
Premier Frank Wise takes over the port-
folios of Industrial Development, Local
Government and Town Planning, for-
merly held by the late Gilbert Fraser.
Wise and Premier Hawke entered Par-
liament together in 1933. A Queens-
lander who went through Gatton Agri-
cultural College, and was an officer in
the Queensland Department of Agricul-
ture and Stock, Wise was appointed
Adviser in Tropical Agriculture by the
W.A. Government in 1929. He was
elected as M.L.A. for Gascoyne in 1933,
became Minister for Agriculture, Educa-
tion, Police aad the North-west in 1936,
Minister for Lands and Agriculture in
1939, and Premier, with Hawke as his
deputy in 1945. After the defeat of the
Government in 1947 he was Leader of
the Opposition until his appointment as
Administrator of the Northern Territory
in 1951. Since 1956, the year of his
retirement from the Territory, he has
been a member for the Northern Province
in the W.A. Legislative Council.

One Labor M.H.R. doesn’t agree with
the Doc. and Arthur Calwell that the
Australian economy is stagnating; he
testifies that at least one section of it
is having a boom.
Replying to a statement by Bill Went-
worth that a book by Leslie Haylen on
Red China was being held back from
publication until after the election, the
author said, “The only reason it has not
been published is that the Australian
book-publishing industry is in a buoyant
state. We have to line up and take our
turn for publication.”

“E. & 0.E.”: A curious reminder of
the Russian revolution was a radio news-
item on drinking among the Czechs.
Lenin decided to wipe out drunkenness
—just like that, with a stroke of a pen.
He explained that it had grown out of
the hardships of the Czarist regime and
now the people themselves would end it.
Forty years later they are still making
heavy weather against it. But in Czecho-
slovakia, we are assured, the rise in
the incidence of drinking is due to the
higher standard of living!

New England University Arts Faculty
has come out strongly against the Dead-
or-alive Defamation Bill. It has carried
resolutions saying that the Cahill Gov-
ernment is trying to get the bill through
Parliament “with extraordinary haste,
making it impossible for citizens to know
and to discuss the contents of the bill
adequately before it is passed,” and
urging that the clause relating to defama-
tion of the dead should be dropped. The
faculty deplores the measures as a hind-
rance to historical and social studies and
fears it will curtail the degree of freedom
now enjoyed “by all who seek to increase

Advocating the establishment of a
Federal Bureau of Water Resources, Pro-
fessor C. H. Munro, of the Civil Engi-
neering Faculty at the University of
N.S.W. and director of research for the
Water Research Foundation of Australia,
told a Sydney meeting of mechanical
engineers that Australia’s water re-
sources were very meagre compared with
those of other continents. He said the
total annual flow of all Australian rivers
was only 60-million acre-feet, compared
with 72-million acre-feet for the Nile
alone; 148-million for the Volga, 474-
million for the Mississippi and 1780-
million for the Amazon. He urged a
national approach to the subject, with-
out regard to State boundaries.

“Trinco”: The Ceylon Government’s
announcement that it would protest to
U.N.O. on race-hatred and discrimination
in South Africa raised some ironical
comments even in Colombo. One news-
paper asked how Ceylon could dare to
talk of race-hatred while it was ruled
by a Government which had pandered
to every raucous communalist cry and
broken faith with a million Tamils. It
seemed a reasonable question.

A new type of mystery witness was
quoted in the Melbourne off - course

Both Dean John Bell, of Perth, who’s
about to retire, and his successor, the
Rev. Brian Macdonald, had war-service,
and each is a popular broadcaster in
the A.B.C.’s religious sessions. Dean Bell

In Westralia he was rector of South
Perth and later of Claremont, then spent
10 years in N.S.W. as Dean of Armidale
and organising secretary of the Austra-
lian Board of Missions. He returned to
Perth in 1953 as rector-in-charge of St.
George’s Cathedral, was made a canon,
and then dean. The dean-elect, Brian
Macdonald, was born in England, trained
at St. Aidan’s Theological College,
Ballarat (Vic.), ordained in 1935, and
filled Westralian pulpits at Williams and
Manjimup, going overseas as an A.I.F.
chaplain in 1940. At present he's

Appointed vice-principal of the City
of London Literary Institute, chief adult-
education centre of London County
Council, Dr. Ronald Smith was educated
at Melbourne High School and Mel-
bourne University. He switched to adult
education as a life job when he left
Australia 10 years ago to become vice-
principal of London’s Kingsway College.
Before that he’d been senior English
master at The King’s School, Parra-

A young man on the way up, Thomas
Gleghorn (sketched herewith) was an
unknown painter until July, 1957. Then
he won the Rockdale Art Award, and
in the last eight months he’s followed
that success by winning six major awards.
He defines himself as an “abstract
impressionist.”
Born at Newcastle (Eng.) 33 years ago,
he came to Newcastle (N.S.W.) as a child
ART
and served his apprenticeship in engineer-
ing with the B.H.P. Co. there. He
became interested in painting, and met
Dobell, who gave him encouragement
and advice over five years. Without this
help, Gleghorn says, he would have got
nowhere. He worked in the display-
studio of Farmer’s Sydney store and
spent his spare time perfecting his tech-
nique. Now he’s a name in the U.S.,
Holland and England as well as here ;
and when Farmer’s recently reopened
their Blaxland Gallery they picked him
as manager.
When Derek G. Hollebone, who had
been resident-director of Port Line, Ltd.,

1919. A break of three years followed,
then he was Mayor continuously for 25
years. His other civic services were:
M.L.A. for three years, M.L.C. for 13,
all elective ; and as well he’s been a

“R.R.D.”: So Field-Marshal Mont-
gomery has bought a bowler-hat. The
British Army won’t be quite the same
when Monty’s gone, because, however
much conventionalists then deplored his
possessive pronoun, it really was his


Army in the years he rolled the Germans
back from El Alamein to the Rhine.
My first meeting with him, when I’d
just come back from the G.H.Q. Battle
School, got me involved in an argument
about some point of weapon-training in
which I rashly said: “Perhaps, sir, being
near the fighting, I might know better
than you.” Later, on the battlefield at
Vibo Valentia, in the toe of Italy, I’d
come up to join a battalion in the sth
Division and travelled from Reggio with
that gallant young Bth Hussar his A.D.C.,
who was afterwards killed in Germany.
We stopped at Monty’s Tac H.Q., which
was in front of Div. H.Q. and about
level with our leading troops. I paid
my respects and was rewarded with a
humorous glance. “Well, D., make sure
your men carry-out their weapon-training
properly, for I shall be watching—yes,
I’ll be watching.”

Gordon De’Lisle says he has to be a
humdrum commercial photographer for
11 i months a year to earn a crust. But
he’s won the first-prize silver medal in
this year’s Italian International Photo-

creative work he did at Rye, near Port
Philip Heads, during a holiday from his
Melbourne studio.
His work is appearing in leading
American and British annuals and
periodicals, as well as in Japan and Italy,
but he modestly ascribes overseas interest
to the wonderful Australian outdoor girl
and the wonderful beaches to be an out-
door girl on —and glosses over his own
creative artistry. Italians write to him in
surprised delight at pictures of happy
young women with a background of miles
of sand ; and Americans write indignantly
they have to travel hundreds of miles to
find a suitable, natural beach.

ABORIGINALITIES
wife and four daughters should
-*-*-*■ possess the nicest heads of hair in
the neighborhood, for tonight I paid-out
£l5O to the plumber for the beautification
of their crowning glories.
Last month the quintet went bush, and
the farmhouse where they stayed relied
on tank-water caught from the roof for
domestic use. When they washed their
hair with it for the first time the women
were agreeably surprised on finding it
dried silky and wavy, and after they
returned home 1 was plagued for several
weeks by each female in turn on the
virtues of tank-water for hair toilet—
the metropolitan water-supply left their
hair like strands of seaweed, they said
Why not install a corrugated-iron tank
to catch the water from the roof?
Thinking of the cost, 1 protested that
the run-off from the roof would be
negligible, but my fifth-year high-school
daughter computed that the run-off from
our My-square home with Perth's average
annual rainfall of 35in. would be approxi-
mately 25,000 gals.
Again I argued that I did not have to
water a flock of ewes, only five, and
again the mathematical genius presented
a formula whereby five women using a
1000 gals, of water each year would only
require a 5000-gal. tank.
Eventually I was brainwashed to their
point of view, and now a fat-bellied
corrugated-iron tank squats on its stand
against the back wall of the house. And
a typically rural custom the women have
brought back with them from the bush is
that of tapping the
rungs with their
knuckles after every
shower of rain to
gauge what the in-
take has been.

“Andee”: A sea-
snake washed up on
a North Queensland
beach was the first
I’d seen at close
quarters. Its 4ft.
length ended in a
flat, eel-like tail, and
was colored yellow-
and-black and
banded in an intri-
cate pattern some-
what similar to a
carpet - snake. The
head was small in
proportion to the
body, while the
mouth was practi-
cally devoid of teeth
there were cer-
tainly no fangs
capable of injecting
a lethal dose of
poison into any
prey. An unnatural
bulge in its waist-
line turned-out to be a toad-fish larger
than a hen’s-egg. Strange that a fish of
that name should kill a sea-snake, just
as a land-snake can die through making a
meal of the giant toad, Bufus marinus.

“Squinter”: The Westralian Forests
Department had a quantify of seed which
they wanted to hold for a few months, and
they weren’t worrying about weevils and
suchlike. Their main concern was with
a little mysterious something that Nature
had implanted in each seed —the urge to
germinate at the right season. They
countered it with another of Nature’s
mysteries—the ability of cold to restrict
and delay that urge. The entire stock of
seeds was held in a refrigeration-chamber
at Robbs Jetty meatworks until the tree
blokes were ready to sow them.

(N.Q.) to Bakerville on what is probably
the old coach road —sad journey really,
with large clearings every so often with
nothing remaining but a heap of bricks,
an old tank or two and a few bits of
broken concrete. Inevitably, too. those
bravely blooming monuments to the old
miners purple bougainvillaes, frangi-
pani and the lonely mango-trees. Good-
ness knows how old they are, and I
doubt if there’s any harder country in
the world for a tree, but still they bloom.
At Mont Albion, where no one remains,
there is a dam that holds a permanent
“Could you dash-off a note for the milkman?"
stretch of water in that drought-stricken
place. I was told by an old resident of
Bakerville that this dam was made over
90 years ago by the entire population
of Mont Albion—men, women and
children, with picks, shovels and hands
—to conserve water for the then thriving
township and mine. The dam must be
almost 100yds. long and all of 20ft. high.
Great trees growing from it testify to
its age. It's my bet that it will still be
there, and functioning, when a lot of
bulldozer jobs costing a great deal of
money have been washed away.
'TTie Sydney report of two business-
men receiving wrapped-up con-
duit instead of sixpences reminds me
that the same stunt was put over a
Chinese hotelkeeper in Rabual. Five-
pound rolls of shillings, commonly known
as “fuses” up here, often pass from hand
to hand without being opened. Working
on this practice, a new arrival deposited
with the hotelkeeper a bag apparently
containing a dozen “fuses” (£6O) and
agreed with Mine Host to draw against it
daily for his spending-money. He then
went on a spree—he was just down from
the Sepik, he explained, and wanted to
see the bright lights. After a few days
he disappeared. Mine Host waited a

CHRISTMAS NUMBER
December 10
First Instalment
of
Two young mates —“Duke” Tritton
and “Dutchy” Bishop—battling round
western N.S.W., taking on anything
that offers in the way of jobs or in
boxing-booths at the shows: shearing,
fencing, rabbiting, droving, gold-digging ;
singing and taking the hat round in the
towns (police permitting); humping their
swags from station to station (“For time
means tucker, and tramp you must”) . . ,
Altogether, a “find” a first-hand
account of a couple of straightforward
young fellows, willing to give anything
a go, and getting to know the real country
and its people, good and so-so. Watch
out for “TIME MEANS TUCKER” in
The Christmas Bulletin.




while, then went to the bank to deposit
the “fuses.” There he found they con-
sisted of carefully sawn galvanised-
piping, having the same weight and size
as 100 shillings. Later the bank intro-
duced money-wrappers punched to show
the minted edges of the coins. These
peekaboo wrappers were discontinued
after the war by this particular bank, but
I understand they have been introduced
by other banks within recent months. —

“Xavier”: “Reims's” par. (B. 5/11/’SB)
reminded me of the court constituted in
a tourist motor-bus at Pine Creek en
route to Alice Springs. Police told the
“Sorry! The gong's gone — it's an R."
s.m., who was travelling to The Alice as
the town magistrate and clerk of courts,
that a drunk had caused trouble and
they wished the matter dealt with
promptly. While the law called the
defendant's name three times outside the
bus, the s.m. sat inside awaiting his
appearance. He didn’t show-up, and the
bail-money was treated as penalty.

“Maitri”: People with young children
who’d like to live on Sydney’s North
Shore sometimes hold back because of
the prevalence there of funnel-web
spiders. Now there’s a new menace. The
other day a chap came on a 6ft.-long
goanna on the Pacific Highway at Killara.
He’s reported to have seen the thing just
near the Greengate Hotel —but that’s no
reason for insinuating anything.
An observant youngster at one of our
Victorian district shows posed this
curly one :• “Why does a horse invariably
put its left leg forward when feeding?”
Anybody know? —“M’Lou.”

“Bagot”: That bottle-oh who purrs
softly into a microphone when doing his
rounds (B. 29/10/’5B) would soon find
himself in strife with Perth’s consta-
bulary. There it is illegal for a dead-
marine collector to make even a whis-
pered appeal for any bottles, or to enter
the backyard of a home without the
occupant’s invitation. Any bloke who
has a pile of empties behind the wood-
shed has the choice of keeping his eye
skinned for the mute progress of a col-
lector, or of phoning a removal-applica-
tion to the office of a receiving-depot.

“Bungaroo”: A Berowra (N.S.W.)
bushland quarry, 20 miles from Sydney,
has revealed the fossilised footprints of
the Labyrinthodont. Perfectly preserved,
they consist of three claws about the
size of a big dog's paw ; the reptile’s
tail can also be clearly seen. Quarry-
owner Geoffrey Scarrott has unearthed
several other sets, but the latest find is
the best. It is considered by scientists of
outstanding importance in providing them
with greater data on the Labyrinthodont
which roamed the Sydney area a short
200-million years ago. The Hawkesbury
sandstone deposits have produced a
number of fossilised relics of the reptile.
“Pip Tok”: While firemen were fight-
ing a bushfire in one of Perth’s outer
suburbs, a 10-year-old girl snatched a
shovel from a fireman’s hands and tried
unsuccessfully to save a bobtailed lizard
from incineration. Frightened back by
the flames, she burst into tears, but an
11-year-old boy took the shovel and com-
pleted the rescue. The girl then took
Bobtail home, where she will keep him
till he’s well enough to be set free.
CAVES
Where shallow voices sound their tune
of words
Whose whisper swells to echo far and
deep;
Where bats fly blind like reeling, drunken
birds,
While ice-cold streams and roaring
rivers creep
Through secret holes to wear their way
within
The earth. A lean, lone light fingers
along
The steaming, frozen darkness to begin
Its moveless dance of death that lasts
as long
As day itself, until it falls and dies
Upon the stalagmites, that glorious
stage
From where its radiant spirit soars and
flies
To rest amidst the stalactites. A rage,
A frightened rage of wonder, grips the
mind
Which looks and listens, dreams, and
tries to feel
This hidden world, but finds instead: eyes
blind,
Ears deaf, flesh numb; then senses
start to wheel.
Still deep and deeper sinks ambition s
spur
In search of beauty and the urge to
know . . .
But what ? That diamond pebbles do not
stir
The dullness of the eyes; that rivers
flow
Too mutely in their song; that pointed
rocks
Do not disturb the slumber of the
flesh ?
The dream must be pursued, ignoring
shocks
Of slipping hands and feet, of holds
that crash
Beneath the pressing weight of hanging
men,
Whose only aim it is to bridge the gap
Which bars the way below. Rolls swifter
then
The icy sweat, escaping to a trap.
Low, lower still. Through halls of
fossiled life,
Down hollowed cliffs that rise from
marble sand,
Until a mass of rock brings all the strife
To one redeeming yet unwanted end.

ALFRED PAUL ZARB.


A local farmer thought he had
got- something when he found
Bacchus Marsh clover on his property
with four, five and six leaves. The four-
leaf clover occurred quite often, the five-
leaf now and again, and the six-leaf was
rare. Manager of a local pastoral com-
pany said that he had heard of four-leaf
clover being found, but the others were
oddities. The district agronomist put
things right. He said that they would
be rarities if the pasture had not been
treated with hormone spray. This spray
was interfering with normal growth, and
did “all sorts of silly things” to plants. —

“Sevenelms”: Often wondered if the
hundreds of Osage-orange hedges in
Australia were planted by archery
enthusiasts. The large and prolific fruit
resemble breadfruit except that they are
soft and explode into a most satisfactory
mess when hurled by schoolboys at one
another. The orange-stick milady uses
to push back her nail-cuticle always has
to be of this wood ( Maclura aurantiaca).
Those (to Australian eyes) deplorable
ranch-fences we see in the movies—
about six barbs stapled on to the
spindliest, crookedest posts —use Osage-
orange. In the ground even the sapwood
is highly durable.

“lolanthe”: A recently published book
describing the life of an English family
who settled near the Sydney suburb of
Cronulla about 1956 contains this:
There were many features of their present
existence that she frankly detested. Life
was little more than an endurance-test.
The white-ants, for all her precautions,
invaded one of the food-containers and
devoured a good part of a sultana cake . . .
brown snakes of a moderately poisonous
variety that entwined themselves round
the stems of bramble bushes, so that the
enjoyment of blackberrying was nullified
by the risk of being bitten . . . the ticks
which inhabited the tea-tree and which, if
disturbed, burrowed under one’s skin,
requiring turpentine or kerosene to make
them back out ... a good deal of the
Australian timber was poisonous, and she
lived in constant fear that one of the chil-
dren would pierce their flesh with a splinter
and develop blood-poisoning. Another
drawback was the paspalum-grass that grew
abundantly, and which, if touched, left a
sticky deposit on one’s skin which was
liable to cause an unpleasant rash or even
dermatitis . . . and in the burning sun
neither she nor the children could wear
stockings.
Name of the book? There Is a
Country. What a country it must appear
to intending migrants!

Sanasi”: The question of how to
classify the product of, say, two half-
caste Australian aborigines (B. 5/11/ ’5B)
has long exercised the minds of Com-
monwealth census officials. They tend to
Put them in as “Europeans.” According
1° Mendel’s Law this is not quite correct
■"Children of such unions would be,
roughly, 25 per cent, inclining to whitish,
5 Per cent; inclining to blackish, and 50
Per cent, half-and-half.
“Ex-R.S.M.”: In her first novel, All
the Rivers Run, which Heinemann is
publishing, Nancy Cato correctly has the
miners skiing on the Kiandra goldfields
ast century using the peculiar ‘butter-
pat skis of Australian design. Forty
years ago , going into a Monaro station
harness-room for a saddle and bridle I
noticed two strange-looking bits ’of
woollybutt-wood, shaped something like
very elongated and solid Canadian snow-
shoes, with rawhide thongs for bindings.
I learned that they were a pair of the
genuine “butter-pats,” and that evening
“Well, make up your mind —outside it says
‘Hot dogs served.' ”
an old album was produced, showing
grandfather using them in a ski-race. He
and all the other competitors wore bowler
hats and stiff collars! No doubt modern
skiing-enthusiasts will be puzzled with
Miss Cato’s descriptions of the skiing of
those days, but it’s right. Does anyone
know of a pair of butterpat skis still in
existence? A friend of mine advertised
for a pair in 1938, wanting them as
curios and offering a good price, but
didn’t get one reply. Today they
would be in the museum - treasure
class.
the Afghan hawker left the
track the outback lost one of its
most colorful personalities. “1 sell any-
thing!” was his motto, and the horse-
drawn caravan was crammed with goods
of all descriptions.
His Middle East ancestors taught him
the art of selling. A gentle, persuasive
manner which left you with the feeling
that you. ought to buy. if only to keep
a battler on the road. Most were battlers,
but they were not down on their luck.
Many became wealthy and owned
stations. They knew how to
handle money and make it
work for them.
The ’Ghan also knew how
to pick his clients. He was
wise enough to sell only to
one sex at a time. No men
were welcome when the
women were picking over
dress-lengths and hats.
His male customers,
mainly rouseabouts and
stockmen on stations, were
ready buyers of shirts of
rainbow-hue with horses’
heads worked on the
pockets, “strike your eye”
ties, fancy socks and tan
shoes. They must have had
a monopoly on the sale of
tan footwear, those hawkers.
Also, where no barbers plied
their trade, hair - clippers
found a ready sale. The
catch - cry of one hawker
was: “They don’t pull, even
when they’re blunt.”
Everyone welcomed the
hawker. He was a fund of
gossip where news travelled
slowly. Because of this, he
was always assured of a
camp and a paddock for his
horses. To show his appre-
ciation, the missus would
get a head-scarf or the
husband a tie that would
scare a kangaroo at 100yds.
The hawkers respected the
police and gave them little
trouble. Contrary to many
tales, they were honest men
who depended on “repeat
business” to keep them on
the road. They drove a hard
bargain, but it was fair deal-
ing, where you could handle
the goods to your Jieart’s
content.
The police gave them a
good trot because they were
useful sources of infor-
mation. An apparently innocent re-
mark —such as, “Saw a man with three
horses‘at the Five Mile yesterday”—could
possibly be the clue for which the Law
had been looking. And the information
was honored. No hawkers were ever
called as witnesses.
Closer-settlement, improved transport
and the large mail-order houses drove
the ’Ghan hawker off the roads. But in
a land of big distances, poor communi-
cations and loneliness, he was a very
welcome roundsman.

THE OUTLOOK NOW
nTHOUGH averages and indexes
will probably show very
little difference between the
profits and dividends of Aus-
tralian companies during 1957-
58 compared with results for
1956-57, there has been a
marginal proportion of com-
panies which have exhibited
a wide variation in earnings
and distributions.
At one end of the scale have
been the better-placed TV-
manufacturers and distributors.
At the other end have been
some of the woollen-textile
cos., some woolgrowers, the
woolbrokers, pastoral-suppliers,
Mort’s Dock and a variety of
smaller manufacturers.
The patchiness has been most
noticeable in this margin. Some
of the bigger and well-but-
tressed cos. among the front-
rankers only just maintained
their figures during the past
year, but that, after all, was
in keeping with average results.
The wide variations have been
among seasonal and marginal
operators.
Check to TV
The boom in TV-manufac-
ture, so spectacular during the
past year, is now tapering-off,
according to such an authority
as Sir Arthur Warner, of
Electronic Industries, biggest
manufacturer of TV-sets in
Australia. Australia, he
reports, has 25 manufacturers
in the business, and competi-
tion has become fierce, with the
prospect of some of the weaker
concerns dropping-out. In-
creased turnover was expected
when TV-transmission began
in States outside Victoria and
N.S.W., but no real benefit was
expected this financial year.
The high profits being
earned by Britain's Associated
Television, estimated at £5
million for this year, compared
with £3,665,000 last year, will
be eyed speculatively by those
with interests in TV-transmis-
sion in Australia. But while
Australian TV cos. are now
r~-
pulling out of the red, it is
unlikely that their earnings will
be as spectacular as those in
the U.K., where stations are
fewer and populations are
denser.
There are to be two com-
mercial TV-stations in Bris-
bane and Adelaide as well as
in Sydney and Melbourne ;
Perth and Hobart will have
one each. In every capital-city
there will be a national station
as well. The position in the
U.K., by way of comparison, is
outlined on page 21, this issue.
Commodity Prices
After an almost steady
decline for months, wool has
shown some firming lately.
This has followed, traditionally,
a stronger market for some of
the metals.
These movements are en-
couraging, though they don’t
indicate any marked change
for the better yet. It
can be said, however, that
when the price of fine wool gets
near the cost of production, or
below it, in Australia (the
world’s most efficient producer
of wool), other countries will
find it hard to stay in the wool-
growing business, and supplies
may tend to fall away. Also,
with wool as cheap as it is it
cuts' the ground from under
competing synthetics— except
where knitters and textile-
makers are tooled-up exclu-
sively for the processing of
synthetics.
Australia is also a pacemaker
in the markets for lead-zinc and
wheat, but it has special
problems (in the way of tariffs,
quotas or subsidised dumping)
to meet in overseas markets
for both those products.
It seems, with the export
income at its present reduced
level and a fairly free go up
till now in the matter of im-
ports, that there must be some
check to importing very early
in 1959. Most people think
that one of the first things the
new Government will have to
do after last Saturday’s elec-
tion will be to face again the
balance-of-payments problem.
Restriction of imports, pro-
vided it is aimed most at
finished goods, will tend to
stimulate local manufacture.
But if raw materials are
treated on the same basis many
sections of industry may be
affected.
Broader Market Strength
Ctrength in the Australian
-sharemarkets lately has
taken on a broader but more
selective front.
While the price of B.H.P.
shares has firmed to 485., it is
still 2s. below the year’s peak ;
AC.I., i.C.1.A.N.Z., C.S.R.,
Tooth and other front-liners
are also still below 1958 peak
prices following the October
setback.
The real strength of the
market at the moment is in the
demand for good second-
liners showing a reasonable
yield. This is noticeable in
Bradford Cotton, Australian
Blue Metal, the Gypsum cos.,
Frederic Ash and other selected
industrial equities.
Selective support is also
being given to vigorous
concerns like Ampol Petroleum,
Electronic Industries, Minster,
Ltd., and interesting enterprises
like Gadsden Hughes (where
shareholders have been advised
not to sell their scrip).
Investors will be wise to
continue their new line of
paying greater regard to yields,
present and in reasonable pro-
spect, and not counting so
much on profits, from the
market.
The Bank-rate Down
/~\n November 20 the Bank
of England rate was
reduced to 4 p.c. In 14
months it has been reduced
from 7 p.c., the emergency
rate imposed in September last
year to check the flight from
sterling into other currencies,
including that of West
Germany. The first reduction
(1 p.c.) from the “summit”
was made in March this year,
and there have been four
reductions, each of \ p.c., since.
The balance of trade recently
has been more favorable to
Britain than for many years,
though there has been some
increase»in unemployment in
sections of industry. Credit-
easing generally has been part
of recent policy to stimulate
home industry, but there has
been a tendency to shun
Government securities as in-
vestments and to speculate in
industrial shares. The drop in
the Bank-rate may help to
make the gilt-edged market
more attractive to institutional
investors even if not to the
general public. -

“ceiling” and Stock Exchange
activity is high—at the end of
the account for early Novem-
ber the number of bargains
marked was the highest since
June, 1955.
Will this bullish market con-
tinue? Is the basis for it
sound? These two questions
are being argued at length,
but there is certainly no
unanimity about the answers,
especially to the second one.
There are, perhaps, two sig-
nificant factors: the demand
for' equities coincides with a
persistent selling of long-dated
gilts; and professional inves-
tors are extremely cautious.
Experienced City opinion is
perplexed at the continued rise
in U.S. prices, and, on reflec-
tion, can find no real founda-
tion for anticipating the cer-
tainty of a solid expansion of
British industry next spring. It
would also appear that the very
low yields under some of the
market-leaders are discounting
not only next year’s dividends
but increased dividends as well.
Inquiries of brokers reveal that
the days when markings were
high made them very busy, but
that “there was not much in
it,” and that few of the orders
were for sizeable amounts.
The inferences are that the
professional is staying out of
the market, except for very
selective buying, that the small
investor is selling his gilts and
climbing on to the equity band-
wagon, and that he may easily
burn his fingers.

Santos
[From L,. Owen]
"p xcitement on ’Change when
flow-oil was struck at Puri
in Western Papua was under-
standable, but the sudden jump
in Santos shares merely
emphasises the neurotic condi-
tion of the Australian oil-share
market. The rise followed talk
that the U.S. affiliate of Santos
was preparing to commence
active operations on the Cor-
dillo Downs, in the n.-e. corner
of South Australia ; the imme-
diate interest of Santos in
these operations consists of a
five per cent, equity.
[lts interests generally are
described on pages 29-30, this
issue.]
It may be as well to review
the actual stage which the
search for oil in the Cordillo
.area has reached.
Firstly, a lobe of the Great
Artesian Basin has been fairly
well defined in the s.-w. corner
of that depression. In that lobe
the maximum depth of
Cretaceous marine sedimen-
taries is placed at around
5500 ft., and, in this trough, a
number of anticlinal folds of
considerable -dimensions are
claimed to occur, although no
conclusive evidence of their
existence at depth has been
published.
Even more importantly, the
legacy of the long Trias land-
phas£ of the areal stratigraphi-
cal column has to be con-
sidered, not only with reference
to the characteristics of the
strata but also as a factor in
the non-persistence of post-
Trias structural features with
depth.
As regards petroleum, so far
it has been encountered in
small quantities in the Wilka-
tana area and only in strata of
Cambrian, age. The source-
rocks are stated, also, to be of
Cambrian age a rather
obvious conclusion, as the
chances of discovering source-
rocks in the pre-Cambrian are
negligible. Moreover, the oil
found around Wilkatana is
definitely of a migrated type.
The measureable samples of oil
recovered need to be subjected
to critical chemical analyses in
order to indicate the orienta-
tion of the source of the
Wilkatana oil.
Even if suitable folds, suit-
ably capped by impermeable
beds, are brought to light, it
should be remembered—par-
ticularly in view of the unique
history of the Australian main-
land—that structure plays a
minor part in the segregation
of commercial petroleum. This
axiomatic fact has been
proved, time and again, during
the long history of drilling for
oil in Australia where, all over
the continent, including S.A.,
the drilling of “anticlines” and
“domes” of varying dimensions
and closures has, invariably,
ended in failure.
Even in U.S.A., where geo-
logical conditions more nearly
approach “normality,” it is now
recognised that stratigraphical
“traps” are more important
than structural ones in the
search for oil.
Whilst an impartial analysis
of the geological characteristics
of the Queensland-S.A. border
does not raise undue hopes of
payable and persistent produc-
tion of black gold, it would he
equally illogical to deny its
possibility. Unless much costly
and abortive drilling is to be
avoided, however, the path (o r
paths) along which the oil has
migrated must be determined
by geological and chemica'
techniques expressly designed
to that end ; the data obtained
must form an essential factor
in the location of the. explore
tory wells.

Therapy of a sort would, I
expect, be a psycholo-
gist’s conclusion as
to the significance
of hula-hooping. At any rate
it has set a good percentage
of the American populace to
gyrating in what appears to
be a savage type of satisfaction.
While adults strain their pro-
testing torsos behind curtains,
hedges and walls, children swing
their hooped hips all over the
fall landscape—do it standing,
walking and at a dead run. Our
11-year-old Anita had a hula-
hoop party on the lawn just
the other day, together with
a contest. The moppet who
won kept the hoop spinning
around her middle for an hour-
and-a-half, and looked fresh
enough to go on for ever.
The plastics industry has
had a grand go of it, of course.
Demand at the height of the
fever rocketed prices two
dollars and better per hoop.
With saturation, they dropped
to less than half that amount.
Popularity continues, however,
along with new developments.
For example, I observe the
makers are shoring-up the
market with hoops gauged to
suit other rotational members
of the body—neck, arms and
]e §s. Also there are models
set with stones, lined with fur
and glo-colored for nocturnal
hula-ing. As one can see, the
possibilities have hardly been
touched.

In October the white-tail
deer season opened for bow-
hunters of this Commonwealth.
This is the fifth year the
archers were turned loose a
month before the gun-men
shouldered arms. In five years
the rate of special licensing
has steadily
climbed from an
initial 4000 toxo-
philes to the cur-
rent 20,000-pins.
Last year the
State’s bowmen
brought down
1800 deer, hardly
a dent in a herd
now numbering
several hundred-
thousand. Motor-
ists, in fact, did
far better—bag-
ging at least 8000
on the highways ;
and, in some
cases, the bagging
was mutual.
It has been in-
teresting to ob-
serve how man’s
skill with the
ancient weapon
has picked up.
That first sea-
son approximately
one archer in 350
got a kill. Five
outings later we
saw it much closer to one man
in every 12. There’s little doubt
the take would be even more
favorable if the either-sex rule
applied. Actually, the doe or
other antlerless deer is fair
game for only a short weekend
during the regular gunning
season.
T}rom personal observation,
we note there is much more
to the present trend toward
archery than the prospect of a
venison steak. It tends to be
a solitary, contemplative sport
—more like fishing—and in
nice contrast to the rin-tin-tin
of our times. It patently
invites just sitting on a stump
or leafy mould watching a
squirrel fill his cheeks with
acorns, or listening to sentinel
crows caw signals to each other
across a yellowing field of corn.
Easy it is to forget one’s
cares, the bow, the chase as
bluejays arch busily across an
even bluer sky. Then, too, a
few thousand bowmen dissolve
to nothingness in 30-million
acres of Penn’s Woods. When
tenfold their number in rifle-
men take the field, there is, on
the other hand, a prevalent
atmosphere of full-scale war.
With all due respect to fire-
arm sporting, it wodld seem
that the bow has returned to
stay.

Stage and Music
Dossor and Malko
English pianjst Lance Dossor
was soloist with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under
Nicolai Malko in the final sub-
scription concert of the
season, and in his reading of
the Schumann Concerto cap-
tured a good measure of the
work’s romantic ardor and
freshness, more especially in
the tender passages of the
middle section ; his episodes
against the massed ’cellos were
quite capitivating. In the
opening movement the free-
fantasia writing suited him well,
with its swift changes of tempo
and key ; and in the final
allegro vivace, after the live-
liest treatment of the develop-
ment section, soloist and
orchestra swept along in
strong rhythmic unity to the
finishing-post. Malko gained
a clean attack and excellent
tone-balance from his forces.
The programme dispensed
with a symphony, but there
was no dearth of music of
weight. There was, for in-
stance, the Prelude and Love-
Death from “Tristan and
Isolde.” In all Wagner—with
the possible exception of the
Bacchanale from “Tannhauser”
—there is no music to match
this for passion and voluptuous-
ness. In the Prelude the con-
ductor wrought a long, gradual
crescendo of splendid control,
capping ♦it with a welkin-
cracking fortissimo, and drop-
ping thence by way of brief
decrescendo to a featherweight
pianissimo. ’Cellos and oboes
combined beautifully to mint
the “love-potion” theme. In
the ensuing Love-Death music
Malko kept up the flow, of
sensuousness, drawing from the
strings and woodwinds some
of the richest sounds heard
this season.
Russia contributed the
second-half of the programme,
beginning -with Prokofief’s
“Lieutenant Kije.” This suite,
based on music the composer
wrote for the film 25 years
ago, is sharp, acidulous, and
shot-through with originality
and wit—as befits the joke
which is its mainspring. Of its
five sections, the most engag-
ingly played were the troika,
“Ever find yourself playing the spots before your eyes ?”
with its charming three-horse-
sleigh accompaniment, and the
concluding andante assai, with
the off-stage fanfare, the
recapitulation of the wedding-
themes, and the muted cornet
salute.
The other piece was
Scriabin’s “Poem of Ecstasy,”
which certainly lends point to
Cecil Gray’s dictum that
“Scriabin has given us syn-
thetic music, ‘musicene,’ which
bears the same relation to
music as margarine does to
butter.” In this second of
his symphonic-ode excursions
into the realm of high meta-
physics the composer does
achieve here and there some
majesty of sound, and in the
winding-up flight there is un-
doubted grandeur, which can't
disguise the fact that this
symbolistic music, overblown
and thick, lacks lasting quality
The orchestra played it with no
particular enthusiasm.
“The Matchmaker”
There are many things to
admire in Thornton Wilder’s
farce-comedy, current at North
Sydney Independent.
The play is set in the 1880’s
and centres on a wealth-crazed
Yonkers businessman, his “Oh-
uncle can’t I get married?”
niece, his two young employees,
his . . . well, it centres on the
Yonkers businessman, anyway,
except that everyone wants to
marry someone. So the comedy
is in the collective pursuit, the
farce in the final general knot-
tying.
Wilder escapes by the skin
of his teeth from falling into
comedy cliches, such as mis-
taken identity and pre-marital
melodrama. Possibly in order
to make a distinction between
the average run of comedies
and this one, he gives his
principals soliloquies in which
they sketch their philosophies —
a sort of thumbnail exposition
of character.
As Horace Vandergelder, the
Yonkers man, Mayne Lynton
started uncertainly, picked-up
in the second scene, and then
slipped again. His niece
Ermengarde was very prettily
drawn by Dorothy Wight.
Roger McDougall stood out in
shining comic relief as one of
Vandergelder’s shopmen, and,
as Mrs. Dolly Levi, friend of
Vandergelder’s late wife, Con-
stance Hobbs showed complete
affinity with Wilder’s text —a
clever and funny portrait.
Neroli Whittle demonstrated
once again her strength as a
character-actress in the part of
a rich spinster — another of
Vandergelder’s friends.

Royal Ballet in Melbourne

approached it the other after-

ance. This, it appeared, was an
ancient ballet custom and indi-
cated that a dancer of that
nationality was about to take-
up her position as a full
ballerina.
This recalls the occasion of
Pavlova’s first visit to the city.
It was officially announced
that, in accordance with an
immemorial Russian custom,
the premiere ballerina had to
be carried over the doorstep of
the theatre or she would not
be able to dance, and that the
heftiest member of the Tail
family had gallantly offered to
perform the operation. This
was done with great success
amidst intense enthusiasm on
the part of the staff, the mem-
bers of the general public who

Pavlova and of Mr. Tait him-
self, who had thought-up the
gimmick while standing on the
wharf awaiting the arrival of
the steamer. He subsequently
remarked that she was almost
as light as she looked in “Swan
Lake.”
The young Canadian was
Lynn Seymour, who danced the
exacting double role of Odette
and Odile in a full-length
presentation of the Tschaikow-
sky ballet, which was tradition-
ally enough done in the first
and second acts, but, in the
third, became terrific and to
anybody sympathetic to the
language of the ballet was
almost terrifying.
Act 111 is where the Prince,
having previously fallen for the
bewitched swan maiden, has to
attend a ball given by his
ambitious mother and choose
a bride from amongst a bevy
of six princesses, any one of
whom would have more than
satisfied the present commen-
tator. Unfortunately he can’t
make-up his mind, as his heart
is elsewhere. At this moment
the Magician arrives with his
daughter Odile, who bears such
a striking resemblance to
Odette that he falls for her
and swears an oath to marry
her and cherish her for ever.
He realises his mistake when
the image of Odette appears
appealingly against the back-
cloth, his anguish is devastating
and the ball breaks-up in
confusion.
In the final act he is still
searching distractedly for
Odette. When he finds her he
becomes even more distracted
as the Magician turns-up and
reminds him of Odile and his
marriage - contract. At the
approach of dawn Odette must
again become a swan, so some-
thing must be done and done
quickly. The Prince then makes
a suicide-pact with Odette, both
jump in the lake, the Magician
drops dead and Odette and the
Prince voyage to the realm of
eternal felicity while the swan
maidens sadly watch them.
There are obviously moments
of sheer banality in this story,
and it is a tribute to the com-
pany that they were success-
fully avoided or passed un-
noticed in the perfection of the
dancing of the little cygnets,
the spontaneous grace with
which Miss Seymour invested
the roles of both Odette and
Odile, and the extraordinary
control of the athletic David
Blair, who danced the role of
the devastated lover so well
that the audience almost
clapped its hands off.

music was under the able direc-

“The Good Oil”
The first Westralian musical
comedy had its premiere in the
hands of the National Theatre
at Perth Playhouse. Book,
lyrics and music are by Coralie
Condon and make lively
modern entertainment inspired
by the excitement of Perth’s
1954 oil-boom.
The story revolves round
a squatter’s daughter who loves
the land, her father who faces
near-disaster through a bogus
company executive, and a
young geologist (friend of her
childhood) who reappears bent
on locating oil on the beloved
station. The plot provides
scope for clever representation
of a city in the midst of share-
fever, when the magic pro-
perties of gold are transferred
to oil and the whole atmosphere
vibrates , with the expectation
of sudden wealth.
The scene changes rapidly
from crowds outside brokers’
offices on St. George’s Terrace
to a squatter’s lavish suburban
home, to a barbecue party, to
an oil-survey camp in the nor’-
west. The subtle use of
“Terrace types” and Robert
Shurman’s striking range
setting in the north are the only
direct regional ties.
As a counterpoise to wool
and oil, Miss Condon has
created a likeable city bloke
with a taste for “the books”
(easily translated to shares)
and the generic name of
Clancy ; he and his girl-friend,
Bunny, are in fact the most
important characters and
their vitality brings freshness
to an otherwise conventional
gallery.
Producer Peter Summerton
handled the large cast and
many scene-changes on a
comparatively small stage
with considerable finesse.
The show demands more
exuberance, however, and
greater emphasis on the wit
of many lines and lyrics ; more
overall pace and sophistica-
tion. The ballets (choreography
by Alison Lee) nearly achieve
the quality of illusion required
in musicomedy, but that
quality could be given to the
whole show by more adroit
presentation, some cutting (of
book, not score) and a cast
well-trained in the nuances
peculiar to this form of theatre.
The orchestra, under Harry
Bluck, gave a smooth perform-
ance, in every way assisting
the cast. If there is not an
outstanding theme-song, there
are several to remember:
“Strangest Illusion,” “Watch-
ing the Market Rise,” “It’s
Good Being Bad,” and, most
amusing, “Don’t Quote Me!”
As Clancy, Ron Graham
gave an admirable perform-
ance, ably supported by Paula
Cantelo, as Bunny. Judy
Schonell, with the assistance
of Bert Shaw, danced delight-
fully, whether in the spirit of
a girl’s romantic dreams, or
in the macabre “good-to-be-
bad” sequence.

Artbursts
Melbourne Exhibitions
Art and near-art is currently
bursting in various parts of
Melbourne. The Museum of
Modern Art is hanging pictures
of country life by Gray Smith,
whose technical ability lags
some distance behind his
imagination. At Kozminsky’s
Galleries, Enid A. Phillip paints
flowers with loving attention to
detail and a brush dipped in
watercolor, but fails on the
artistic side by not giving them
sufficient atmosphere to breathe
in.
Cathleen E. Edkins has an
expansive show at the
Athenaeum. If the present
commentator believed in rein-
carnation he would have to
think that Miss Edkins was the
avatar of the late Septimus
Power. Her racehorses, per-
cherons, galloping girls, steeple-
chases, etc., could easily be
mistaken for works of that
master, and the likeness is con-
tinued even into the little
landscapes.
Power used to say that he
hated painting portraits of race-
horses and important people
and would sooner paint little
landscapes. His real love
showed in the fact that his
little landscapes were ever so
much more living than his
“important-subject” pictures.
Miss Edkins’s “Sunlight” and
“Convict Cottage, New* Nor-
folk” reflect the same love.
They are simple studies of
sunlight falling on white walls
and leaves and are more reveal-
ing than the whole of the rest
of her output.

Hal Missingham’s individu-
alism is evident in his exhi-
bition at the Skinner Galleries,
Perth, in his unusual choice
of subjects and the turn of
humor in his titles A painting
of an abandoned piece of junk
called “Dying Refrigerator” is
the sort of thing he enjoys—
he is a master of old iron,
decaying timber and dilapi-
dated buildings.
He does not, apparently,
agree with Yeats that “The
wrong of unshapely things is
a wrong too great to be borne,”
but he takes the unshapely
things, splashes them with' the
colors of rust and decay, and
makes pictures of them. Very
good pictures, too, such as
“Bush Privy,” a faithful repro-
duction of the last stage of
what used to be one of the
outstanding features of the
Australian landscape.

THE FAMILY
Every family ha 3 it 3 “Uncle Fred.” Very often he is
not a blood-relative but an old friend of the family
known affectionately by the children as “Uncle,” an
honorary title earned by his many kindnesses and
generosity. Hard to know how to repay him without
offending, for he is the traditional giver but no
“Uncle” would resent a subscription to “The Bulletin,”
the most diplomatic and welcome of gifts to any

A gift to “Uncle Fred” has possibly never occurred to
you or the children, nor has a gift from you ever
occurred to him. A gift such as this would therefore
come as a complete surprise.

stances. He finds tension
among the crew when he takes-
over at a New Zealand port,
and discipline is at rock-bottom.
After a few days at sea he pin-
points the troublemakers a
couple of engine-room hands,
led by Broderick Crawford,
who shortly thereafter launch
a scheme to murder the key
men aboard, put the rest of
the crew in lifeboats and make
for some port to sell the cargo.
The plot seems beyond
belief, but it is said to be based
on an actual case. The reso-
lute skipper swims back to the
freighter from the lifeboat,
climbs back aboard via the log-
line, and foils the maritime
bandits.
Crawford is convincing as
the brutal, cold-blooded killer
with an outsize egotism but in-
sufficient brain-power; and
Mason exudes an easy authority
as the Old Man determined
to save his ship. Dorothy
Dandridge, as the wife of the
Maori cook, exercises some
slinky voluptuousness among
the crew until her cue comes
to encompass the destruction
of one of the mutineers —but
the impression remains that
she was included as a sop to
box-office fear of a cast without
sex-appeal. Andrew and Vir-
ginia Stone, who made the
film, have given it suspense and
realism.

“The Barbarian and the
Geisha”
Hollywood celebrated the
centenary of the breaching of
Old Japan’s isolation with the
advent of the U.S.’s first
Consul, Townsend Harris, by
making this semi-biographical
of that apparently sturdy
character, but they made the
prime bloomer of casting John
Wayne in the central role. Mr.
Wayne does well enough when
he’s chasing some hombre
across a desert on a paint-
pony, and when the dialogue
is limited to oratorical bursts
such as “Yep, pard,” or just
plain “Nope!” When, as here,
he is forced to make speeches
—which he delivers with a rasp-
ing monotony—he gives the
impression of being as uncom-
fortable as a shag in an aviary.
If the late Mr. Harris were the
diplomat Mr. Wayne portrays,
the wonder is that the top Nips
didn’t aim him out forthwith
and go back to placid con-
templation of their navels.
Director John Huston seems
to have set out to build a sort
of “Butterfly” romance between
Wayne and the Japanese
beauty (Eiko Ando) who is
placed in his household by a
Samurai lord to spy on the
American ; but with Wayne’s
elephantine efforts at the
gentle art, allied to his gravel
voice and general bearlike
attitude, he apparently lost
heart, so that luv gets lost
somewhere among the sacred
bamboos and the temples.
Much is made of the ritu-
alistic orgies and the pageantry
of Old Japan, and these, as
well as some well-staged
dances, are nicely photographed
in color.

Waltons-Sears, Ltd.
Tn the fast - growing Waltons - Sears
■*- organisation the emphasis is on mail-
order and credit-retailing, and these two
aspects of the business were developed
with characteristic vigor last term. But,
as a retailer, Waltons-Sears, Ltd., doesn’t
fall neatly into any one category, the
co.’s 49 branches including large capital-
city department - stores, a string of
suburban and country outlets, mainly
concerned with the sale of furniture and
household-appliances, and a number of
catalogue-sales stores displaying mail-
order wares in country centres.
Unlike some of its colleagues in the
retailing world, Waltons-Sears appears to
have no doubt as to the manner and
markets in which it intends to expand,
some aspects of this problem being some-
what simplified by the availability of
financial and technical assistance from
the big U.S. shareholder, Sears, Roebuck
and Co. As chairman Norman Rydge
put it last year, “We believe that our
greatest success can be achieved by
development in the pattern of Sears,
Roebuck and Co., with the continued
expansion of mail-order operations which
will embrace catalogue-sales stores, and
by the building of retail department-
stores with adequate parking facilities.”
Mail-order activities have grown at a
great rate since purchase of the Vic-
torian mail-order concern, Wakes Con-
solidated, Ltd., in 1956, and in that
period over a dozen catalogue-sales stores
have been opened and the annual distri-
bution of catalogues raised to around
1,000,000 copies. Direct retailing has been
extended, too, by the purchase of small
established retail stores, while sites suit-
able for the erection of large department-
stores have been bought at Bankstown
(Sydney) and the Melbourne outer-
suburb of Clayton.
The total book-debts carried by the
group have jumped by 100 p.c. over the
past three years and the provision of
credit continues to be an increasingly
important angle of group operations,
leading, late last term, to formation of
the wholly-owned Waltons-Sears Credit
Corporation, Ltd., with a paid capital
of £2,000,000.
Sears first joined Waltons [which began
as Cash Orders (Amalgamated), Ltd., in
1926] in an unsuccessful bid for Foy and
Gibsons, Ltd., in 1955, and shortly after-
wards took-up a large shareholding in the
co., paying a 100 p.c. premium, with an
option of increasing its share-interest to
50 p.c. of issued ord. capital on the
same terms. The option remains in force
until 1960, but may be extended at the
discretion of the board.
The purchase of the Brisbane retailer
Overall’s, Ltd., followed rejection of a
well-publicised offer for the ord. capital
of Cox Bros. (Aust.), Ltd.
Sears has continued to invest in the
local co., putting-up £580,000 in capital
and premiums last term, other share-
holders paying a final call during the
year on scrip issued (one-for-one at par)
in 1954. At July 31 last, paid' capital
was £4,031,957, of which £829,650 was
in “A” ords., held by Sears, £2,802,307
in ord. stock-units and £400,000 in 6 p.c.
and 10 p.c. prefs.
Loan- and debenture-money has also
played a large part in the development
of the co., and £1,000,000 was raised
on 74 p.c. debenture-stock last term, the
group’s secured liabilities (including over-
draft) amounting to approximately
£8,000,000 at balance-date. The issue of
debenture - stock under W.-S. Credit
Corp’s. first prospectus had brought in
around £2,400,000 in the current term.
With the help of large amounts of
outside money Waltons-Sears has been
able to maintain a reasonable earning-
rate on the growing ord. capital, the
profit attributable to ord. shareholders
last term equalling 18 p.c. on average
ord. capital, compared with 18.6 p.c. in
each of the two preceding terms.
The volume of turnover and the net
profit for the year to July 31 last were
both at record levels, group earnings,
excluding those of W.-S. Credit Corp.,
advancing by £49,706 to £627,778, after
deducting the outside shareholders’ cut,
making an undisclosed provision for
taxation, and allowing £72,952 (up
£6313) for depreciation:

All but £94,079 of the profit went out
as divs., leaving the £547,335 of share-
premiums (arising from issues to Sears
and vendors of various businesses, etc.)
as the main force behind the-growth in
net reserves (up £441,651), among which
share-premiums figure at £1,181,210.
On the div.-record alone, scrip in
Waltons-Sears is an interesting proposi-
tion —last term’s 15 p.c. div. being the
twelfth successive distribution at this
rate —but the sharemarket has its eye
on future, rather than immediate, re-
wards, and prices the f.-p. ss. ords. at
16s. 6d. to return £4 10s. lid. p.c. at
the current div.-rate. Net tangible cover

During the year the businesses of

Fairfield, a further seven stores (in Mel-
bourne suburbs) being added to the chain
in the current term by the purchase, for
a share consideration, of the paid capital

continued last term, financed, in part,

ever, one of the most encouraging of

isn’t evident from the consolidated
accounts as they exclude the figures of

turnover and earnings in the first 10
weeks of the year.
New Zealand Insurance Co., Ltd.
HThis übiquitous New Zealander will
have been in the underwriting game
for 100 years by the end of the current
term, and some indication of the co.’s
success over the near-century can be
gathered from the fact that £2,700,000
of its £3,000,000 paid capital has come
from reserves, the last wad of gift-scrip
going out in 1955 on a one-for-one basis.
Unprofitable operations in the over-
crowded North American markets have
eaten into underwriting profits over the
past couple of years, but the share-
market isn’t particularly disturbed by
the consequent drop in earnings—sharp
fluctuations in underwriting profits are,
in any case, more or less inevitable—
and the f.-p. £1 (N.Z.) ords. last sold
on the Sydney ’Change at 90s. to return
a mere £3 9s. sd. p.c. from a 124 p.c.
distribution. The board celebrated the
co.’s diamond jubilee with a 24 p.c.
bonus-div., and higher taxes in the home-
land would make a repetition of this
performance doubly welcome to local
shareholders.
N.Z. Insurance is interested in fire,
accident and marine risks in most parts
of the world, particularly in the Americas,
Europe and Australia, collecting over 80
p.c. of its premium-income from outside
the Dominion. A trust department also
adds to earnings and at May 31 last had
over £2B-million of assets under its
control.
Earlier this year N.Z. Insurance was
appointed managing-agent of the newly
formed Mutual Life and Citizens’ Fire
and General Insurance Co. Pty., a sub-
sidiary of M.L.C. Assurance Co., Ltd.,
which, in common with other leading
life-offices, has decided to move into the
fire-and-accident field.
An “exceedingly bad’’ underwriting
experience in North America was given
as the main cause of a slump in the
N.Z.I. underwriting-surplus in 1956-57,
and, although there has been a curtail-
ment of business in this area, operations
in both U.S. and Canada were unprofit-
able last term. It may be a few years,
according to the board, before profits
are again won in these countries.
The fall in net premium income, down
£285,067 at £7,575,979, was due “solely"
to the limits placed on U.S. writings,
improved incomes resulting from activi-
ties in most other territories:

Apart from the difficulties encountered
in North America, the fire and accident
departments returned satisfactory profits,
but aviation contracts proved unprofit-
able, while high repair-costs, a number
of total losses and the seizure of Dutch
vessels by the Indonesian Government
left the hull section of the marine depart-
ment well in the red.
Overall losses actually fell by £110,353,
but as a percentage of the smaller
premium income rose by 265. p.c. to
75.8 p.c., the highest point reached since
1906, the year of the San Francisco
earthquake. Increased salary-costs in
practically every country in which the
co. operates helped to push-up the
expense-rate from 22.7 p.c. to 26 p.c.,
losses and expenses combined equalling
101.8 p.c. of premiums.
The reserve for unexpired risks relat-
ing to U.S. business was strengthened
during Fhe year by the transfer of a
£254,248 capital-profit on sale of invest-
ments. Excluding this transfer and an
associated exchange - adjustment, the
underwriting-account showed a deficit of
£37,210 (as against a £91,054 surplus in
the preceding year) after making a
£106,000 smaller provision for unexpired
risks.
The continued improvement in the net
yield from investments (from 3.53 p.c.
to 3.59 p.c.) was more encouraging, and
investment income, less taxes and a
£36,502 provision for depreciation (down
£4990), rose by £16,929 to £434,612 to
give a total net profit of £397,402, or
£111,335 below the previous term’s
effort:

Written after setting aside an unstated
amount for taxation, the £397,402 profit
represented 13.2 p.c. on share-capital,
compared with 16.9 p.c. in 1956-57 and
24.4 p.c. in 1955-56. On its own, invest-
ment income, which is regarded as the
principal source of shareholders' divs.,
equalled 14.4 p.c. on capital, covering
the unchanged 124 p.c. div. with £59,612
to spare.
The co.’s strength, from the point of
view of both shareholders and policy-
holders, is apparent from the balance-
sheet figures,, reserves, including provi-
sion for unexpired risks (a substantial
58.8 p.c. of net premiums), figuring at

Appleton Industries, Ltd.
A nother record-breaking display last
term by Appleton Industries, Ltd.,
has won from the sharemarket an
enthusiastic recognition of the potentiali-
ties of scrip in this Queensland-registered
manufacturer. Priced at 18s. 6d. a year
ago, the co.’s f:-p. 10s. ords. brought
20s. in June of this year and last week
sold at 265. to yield £3 16s. 1 Id. p.c.
from a 10 p.c. div. At this price last
year's profit gives an earnings-yield of
£l3 2s. 7d. p.c.
During the 10 years since Appleton
Industries took-over the louvre-window
business of N.V. Appleton Pty. and Naco
Trading Pty., profits have, at times,
followed a rather erratic course, but since
1950 the lowest earning-rate on ord.
capital has been 21.8 p.c.—and that on
a capital increased by a one-for-one
bonus-issue in the preceding term (May,
1955) Over the last four years the
earning-rate has averaged 29.2 p.c. on
the present (£500,000) ord. capital.
The co. caters, in the main, for re-
quirements of building and allied trades,
manufacturing louvre - windows and
-shades, steel and aluminium window-
frames, steel-frame buildings, hot-water
systems, remote-control window-opening
devices, plastic sinks, etc., as well as
enjoying a large glass trade. Factories
are located in Brisbane and Sydney, and
branch-offices in N.S.W., Victoria and
South Australia.
The successful development of over-
seas markets has been a feature of
Appleton's expansion over the last few

announced that it was about to
commence the assembly of
louvres in the U.K. At present
the main (Brisbane) factory
supplies customers in over 80
countries, and it is hoped that
the U.K. plant, and, if neces-
sary, similar units in other
countries, will meet the needs
of buyers in areas where
import or other restrictions
now limit trade.
Expansion within Australia
has included the purchase, for
cash, of the Queensland and
N.S.W. assets of Wiles Manu-
facturing Co., Ltd., in April,
1957, and, in the current term,
a successful bid (of 2s. 9d. a

However, if the tax-provision
is taken as a guide, taxable
earnings were around 16 p.c.
greater than the figure indi-
cated. The £172,640 profit
includes a £1950 div. on the
redeemable pref. capital in a
subsidiary, ord. shareholders’
proportion of the profit repre-
senting 34.1 p.c. on ord.

A one-for-four par issue
brought in £50,000 of new ord.
capital in 1954, but, by holding
the div.-rate at 10 p.c. for the
past nine years the board has
been able to rely on retained
earnings to provide most of
the funds needed for the
growth of the undertaking.
This reinvestment of earn-
ings has led to the speedy
accumulation of reserves,
which, at the end of last term,
exceeded ord. capital by £3185,

overdraft by £66,523 over the
year, the surplus of current

in stocks throwing additional
light, perhaps, on the small but
rather unexpected slip in book-
debts (down £6702). The out-
lay on fixed assets (a net
£42,916) covered, among other
things, the completion of
extensions to the Revesby

plans to manufacture lines
previously turned-out only in

with the Cooper Louvre Gis-

Artesian Basin proved satisfac-
tory, Santos would gain more
by activity there than by pur-
suing work in the Lake Torrens
area. It has now been found,
chaiiman J. L. Bonython told
shareholders in Adelaide on
October 31, that a structure in
the deeper parts of the basin
altered previous conceptions
and proved the soundness of
Levorsen’s advice.
Santos, formed for the main
purpose of looking for oil in
the Great Australian Basin,
spent considerable time and
money exploring and drilling
in the Wilkatana area. In
November, 1955, it was able to
extend its area to include the
far north-east of S.A., and
early in 1957 applied for an
area in s.-e. Queensland ad-
joining to facilitate exploration
over the deeper parts of the
basin. Endeavors have been
more and more concentrated
on the basin, and the Bowen
Basin and portion of the
Georgina Basin have been
relinquished.
Santos still has “certain
rights” over Bathurst and Mel-
ville Islands in the N.T. It
has also applied for a small
area in the Simpson Desert,
just across the S.A. border.
Operations for the year to
June 30, 1958, cost a net
£129,582, making total debit
in p.-and-l. account £440,105
on balance-day. The co. then
had £87,743 in cash, stores, etc.,
£68.745 in vehicles, plant, etc.,
and owed outsiders £12,527.
Paid capital is £614,661 in
4,922,500 shares and stock-
units of 2s. 6d. each.
An arrangement with Delhi
Australian Petroleum Co., Ltd.
(formed by Delhi-Taylor Oil
Corp., of U.S.A.), will now
relieve the outgoings of Santos
considerably.
Apart from the intention to
begin a deep stratigraphic well
before February 1, 1959, Santos
and Delhi have yet to decide
about certain future activities.
As things stand, the Santos
areas in S.A. and s.-w. Q. are
to be checkerboarded into one-
minute squares (900 acres).
The two areas are to be
divided and held in separate
licences by Santos and Delhi.
If Delhi moves out, its licence
reverts to Santos.
Delhi will drill without cost
to Santos a stratigraphic weil
to a depth of not less than
14.000 ft. (subject to certain
reservations). If the hole is not
drilled to 14,000 ft. another
hole will be drilled unless
Delhi considers there is no
oil in the whole area. ' Unless
it decides in good faith against
the venture, Delhi will spend a
minimum of 500,000 dollars a
year on drilling and exploration
for four years after drilling the
first hole.
Delhi is to pay Santos a
royalty of about 5 p.c. on any
production from Delhi
“squares.”
Early in July last the first
Delhi field personnel arrived.
A seismic survey-team from
the S.A. Mines Department is
now at work, under Delhi
direction, in the Innamincka
area (n.-e. S.A.). Dr. Levorsen
joined the team last week.

MERITS YOUR SUPPORT
MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, November 18.
'T'he Royal Commission on
Local Authority Finance
has recommended that a local-
body levy of 2d. in the £1
all earnings and company
profits —on the same basis as
the existing social - security
charge —should be collected
by the Government and dis-
tributed to territorial local
bodies. Property rates should
be reduced correspondingly, it
says.
The commission estimates
that the proposed levy should
produce between £6 million
and £7 million a year, an
amount equivalent to about a
third of the rates now struck
by all local bodies.
It suggests that the levy
should be distributed on the
basis of one-third on popula-
tion, one-third on rateable
capital-value and one-third on
the amount of rates collected.
It thinks this will give local
bodies as near as is practicable
an amount equivalent to that
contributed by their own
citizens.
The commission emphasises
that the proceeds of the levy
are intended to be in relief of,
and not in addition to, existing
rate-levies. It says that if local
bodies received some additional
assistance from the National
Roads Board, as it suggests,
they could and should reduce
their rates by the amount they
received from the local-body
levy.
It recommends that the
maximum amount for general
rates that can be struck under
the existing rating provisions
be reduced by the amount of
the levy so that the product
of the general rate struck and
the levy shall not exceed this
maximum amount.
Rates—or Taxes?
The commission says it
bases its levy recommendation
on the conclusion that the
burden of local-body expendi-
ture should not be borne
wholly by ratepayers, but that
a reasonable proportion should
be borne by the general body
of citizens in each local district.
“Ratepayers would contri-
bute as well as other citizens,
but would benefit by a reduc-
tion in their rates, which in
the aggregate should be greater
than their contribution to the
levy,” the commission says.
The commission finds that
funds available for local-body
loans have not in recent years
been adequate to satisfy the
demands and does not think
they will be adequate in the
near future.
Local-body loans, it says,
are already absorbing a reason-
able share of the investment
funds available, and any in-
crease in the amount of those
loans or even a continuance
at the present rate may tend
to have an adverse effect on
other essential development.
If local-body pressure on
the capital-market is to be
eased it seems that the local
bodies will have to postpone
some projects and proceed with
others only to the extent that
money is available from
revenue, the commission con-
cludes.
It recommends that the de-
mands of local bodies on loan
funds should be regulated and
controlled by the Local Gov-
ernment Loans Board so that
the market may be properly
organised and priority ensured,
within the capacity of the
market, for the most urgent
and essential works.
The loans board should
work in co-operation with the
Capital Issues Committee to
ensure that the legitimate
requirements of the local-body
sector and the private invest-
ment sector are met in the most
efficient way for the benefit of
the national economy.
Local Authority Finance
The establishment of a
Local Authority Finance Cor-
poration is approved by the
commission. It says, however,
that the corporation should
have independent status and
not be under direct Govern-
ment or Treasury control.
The functions and powers
of the proposed corporation
would include:
To take-over the local authority
superannuation business of the
National Provident Fund and the
responsibilities now delegated to the
investment committee of the fund.
To lend to local authorities the
funds accruing from this and also
funds raised by corporation
borrowing.
To issue its own stock or deben-
tures with trustee status, against
the security of debentures held from
local authorities.
To be able to act as paid agent
or broker for local authorities in
raising loans.
A number of other powers
are proposed. The corporation
would have normal overdraft
accommodation to enable it to
keep its funds fully invested
with local authorities and also
any other financial assistance
through the Reserve Bank as
might be deemed necessary by
the bank for the implementa-
tion and extension of the
corporation’s operations.
Present interest - rates,
according to the commission,
are “realistic and reasonable.”
“While we agree with the
Monetary Commission in
thinking that the ultimate
objective of a free market in
money is undoubtedly the best
policy, we do not think that
can be expected at the present
time....,” it says.
“We did not find that inves-
tors generally complained that
interest-rates were too low, nor
did they think that an in-
creased rate would necessarily
increase very greatly the
amount of money that would
be invested in local-body
loans.”
The World Bank
The commission adds its
voice to those which have for
so long urged that New
Zealand should join the World
Bank.
“It might at least enable the
Government to obtain some of
its capital-requirements from
abroad (at a lower rate of
interest than it paid recently in
London) and so free more local
funds for the local-body and
private-investment sectors,” it
says.
Coal for Japan?
A possibility that N.Z. may
be able to develop a valuable
coal trade with Japan has
recently opened up.
A trial shipment of 5700
tons of West Coast coking-coal
for Japanese steel-mills is
being loaded at Greymouth
into Japanese ships early next
month.
If this trial fulfills Japanese
requirements a steel company
seeking to develop trade with
New Zealand will fly technical
experts to the West Coast to
survey existing coal reserves
and recommend port-develop-
ment work.
According to the N.Z. repre-
sentative of this firm, require-
ments to make the trade per-
manent would be that a deep-
water port, capable of taking
10,000-ton vessels, be made
available in two years, and that
1,000,000 tons of coal a year
—double the district’s whole
present production—be guaran-
teed.


Do it Yourself
By
DOUGLAS REEVE
Sorry, old chap, switching
over to another channel
like that without asking
you. You might have
wanted to watch the con-
founded thing. It was very
rude of me, 1 must apologise.
Of course, I should have
asked you, but I’ve such an
aversion to all this handyman,
do-it-yourself tripe that I just
didn’t think. You’re sure you
don’t mind? I mean, we don’t
want to invite you in to watch
television and then censor your
programmes—if you want to
watch it I’ll willingly switch
back ; I can always go in the
kitchen and read. You’re quite
sure now?
Every man to his trade, I
say. One man, one job, is my
motto. This is an age of
specialisation. If you want a
job done properly leave it to
the man who knows how.
Doesn’t it stand to reason that
the man who has spent long
years learning his trade can do
the job better than you can?
Of course it does ; you don’t
have to answer. I hope I’m
not interrupting your viewing,
old chap ; there isn’t much on
at the moment. But at eight-
o’clock there’s a show on that’ll
kill you ; you’ll die laughing.
It started when I was board-
ing with the Martins. We
used to watch it regularly every
week. Talk about laugh. I
reckon it gets better, too, the
longer it goes on. You can’t
say the same about some of
the shows.
I went to school with Tom
Martin and we pretty-well
grew-up together. We’d been
friends all our lives. When
Tom married and I didn’t it
seemed sort of natural that I
should move in with them.
I think they found me the ideal
lodger in many ways. I was
very quiet and considerate, you
know. I kept out of the way
and didn’t presume on our
friendship in any way. There
are times when a young mar-
ried couple want to spend the
evening together, and I’d know
instinctively and go off to the
pictures or somewhere by
myself.
Yes, it all worked out per-
fectly for several years. We
had some fine times together.
You couldn’t find a nicer guy
or a more considerate husband
anywhere in Australia than
Tom Martin ; he’d have told
you so himself, and who could
know better?
We had some good times
together all right. With some
fellows there might have been
friction at times, but I always
went out of my way to try to
be nice, and if you really try,
I mean really, there’s never any
occasion for quarrelling. They
had their small rows and spats
at times —what young couple
doesn’t? —but I never inter-
fered or took sides. It
wouldn’t have been right,
would it?
'T'om was a handyman, one of
these do-it-yourself mer-
chants, and he’d got the bug
really bad. There wasn’t a
thing around the house that he
wouldn’t try to fix. He was
good at it, too. It took time,
of course ; Rome wasn’t built
in a day. But if something
went wrong Tom would get it
fixed eventually.
Some of the small things,
like fixing a new tap-washer,
he’d get around to straight-
away, aiM before many weeks
had passed the tap would be
as good as new. And it
wouldn’t cost a thing, that was
the beauty of it. Not even the
price of the tap-washer. He’d
get a piece of leather, from
the tongue of your slipper or
out of a leather belt that was
lying around, and carefully cut
out a circle; he’d buy a
leather-punch from the hard-
ware-store and punch out a
little hole in the middle, and
there you are. Wonderful.
Some jobs that he didn’t
know much about would take
a little longer, of course. Once
the mantel-radio was on the
blink, and radio was one thing
that Tom didn’t know much
about, but he got books out
of the library and studied-up
on the subject. Believe it or
not, that wireless was back in
working-order in less than six
months.
Tom used to get all the books
on the subject—and believe me
there are plenty of them. It’s
a sort of disease, you know,
and to my way of thinking a
lot of money is being made
out of it. He used to get half-
a-dozen books from America
every month and about the
same number from England.
They were, every one of them,
stuffed from cover to cover
with things to make and do.
Tom had all sorts of things
in his backyard that he had
made. A loom, a potter’s-
wheel, half a caravan, a brick-
making machine and a
hydraulic-press. This last affair
was a very big project. You
see, I even know the language:
a project, that’s what they call
these things you make your-
self.
The council tried to make
him take the hydraulic-press
down because it was made out
of railway-lines, bits of old
cars and so on and it reared-
up over the houses and, they
said, it depreciated property-
values in the district, a
restricted residential area. They
said it came under the heading
of heavy machinery and there-
fore wasn’t allowed to be used
in that particular area. But
Tom had them there. As he
pointed out triumphantly, the
press wasn’t used and never
had been.
He won his point, and they
had to let him keep it. Tom
was cock-a-hoop and told us
gleefully that if he ever had
need for a hydraulic-press it

was right there waiting, and
he’d easily be able to sneak
up and use it without the
council knowing.
Linda was a little distressed.
It was Tom’s first brush
with the authorities ; and hav-
ing won the day, he wa9
inclined to be a little
bumptious.
I think the first gloss was
wearing off their marriage, you
see, and neither of them was
quite as loving and forgiving
as at first. Little things had
begun to irritate Linda. The
first real row they had was
while we were all sitting watch-
ing a handyman’s session on
TV. Tom was inclined to be
a little scornful of the man’s
efforts to demonstrate how to
nail the fibro on a garage, and
was keeping-up a running com-
mentary of derision while we
watched.
“You wouldn’t read about
if,” said Tom. “Get a load of
that. He’s using a panel-saw
to cut a piece of hardwood.
A panel-saw on hardwood!”
Tom pretended to be very
shocked.
“Well, after all,” said Linda
in a slightly chilly tone, “he’s
an expert. You mayn’t agree
with him, but he’s not in a
position to put you right. I
imagine he knows what he’s
doing ; you’re probably wrong.
After all, you’re an accountant,
not a carpenter.”
Tom didn’t see any danger-
signals and was disposed to
argue. He went on in a rather
nettled tone: “My dear, one
doesn’t have to be •an expert
to know that you don’t use a
panel-saw on hardwood.”
He tried to pull me into the
discussion: “Don’t you agree
with me, Arthur?”
“You know I’m a perfect
fool when it comes to tools,
Tom,” I said diffidently. “I’m
just a bank-clerk. I leave all
this sort of. thing to those who
know about it.”
He didn’t detect any irony
in my tone and went on to
give a learned discourse about
the number of teeth to the inch,
which was quite above my
head. Linda was pointedly not
listening, and was staring
fixedly •at the screen with a
rapt expression.
Tom gave it away eventually
and watched the screen. Every
now and again he would
give a deep sigh or a snort, but
nobody bit.
After a while he let out such
a fiowl of anguish that we were
quite startled.
“What’s the matter, dear?”
asked Linda sweetly.
“Two-inch nails, narrow
gauge,” said Tom in a stricken
voice. “He’s using two-inch
nails! His garage will probably
fall down after a few years.”
“Yes, dearest,” said Linda
even more sweetly. “But at
least he’ll be able to keep his
car in it before it falls down,
won’t he?”
This was a declaration of
war and we all knew it. I
got up, with a muttered excuse,
to go to my bedroom and
leave them to it, but Linda said
in tones of honeyed sweetness:
“Oh, don’t go, Arthur; it’s
your favorite programme at
eight-o’clock.”
I flopped back into my chair
and didn’t look at them.
She was, of course, referring
to the fact that although he
had built himself a sizeable
workshop in the garden, Tom
had so much gear, half-built
boats and so on in the garage
that it was impossible to get
the car in, and so, for a couple
of years, it had stood outside.
It hadn’t done the car any
good and the duco particularly
had suffered. For some time
it had been a talking-point
whenever there had been dis-
agreement on any subject at all.
To do him justice, Tom had
felt a little guilty; he had
picked-up an electric-motor, a
compressor and an air-tank at
various auction-sales and had
rigged a spray-painting outfit
with which to re-duco the car.
Unfortunately the air-tank had
a small hole in it (this was per-
haps why they’d auctioned it)
and it was awaiting the com-
pletion of Tom’s welding-outfit
before it could be repaired.
~VTOT unnaturally, Tom was cut
to the quick at this remark
and, to Linda’s evident disap-
pointment, he said nothing and
moodily watched the handy-
man pursue his downhill path
to perdition.
I think Linda was seething
underneath her calm, unruffled
surface ; I saw her deliberately
stick her needle in her finger,
wince, and give a half-stifled
cry of pain.
Tom didn’t pay her any
attention, and, thinking some
comment was called for, I
asked solicitously, “What’s the
matter, Linda? Did you stick
the needle in your finger?”
Linda was very brave. “Oh,
it’s nothing, Arthur. Just a
prick. Now that I can’t use
my sewing-machine I have to
do it all by hand. In this dim
light I quite often prick my
finger, but usually I don’t com-
plain. It was rather deep this
time ; I’m sorry if I disturbed
you.”
Still no comment from Tom.
Linda continued, her voice
trembling a little, “Did you
know, Arthur, that my mother
and father gave me a lovely
new electric sewing-machine as
a wedding present? It was a
joy to use it. Tom’s turned
it into the duckiest little jig-
saw out in his workshop: you
should ask him to show it to
you one day.”
Tom spoke rather loudly to
me: “Yes, Arthur, and I fully
intended to give it back to her,
as she very well knows. The
motor burned-out when I was
cutting out the wireless-cabinet.
It had no guts at all, that
motor —no guts at all.”
Linda gave a brave little
smile like Joan of Arc at the
stake.
“So you see, Arthur, I have
to do all sewing by hand now.”
Tom began to stamp about
the room causing the garage
to rock precariously on the
screen. Perhaps Tom was right
about the two-inch nails. The
handyman looked alarmed.
Tom thumped with his fist
on the table. “Arthur,” he
demanded in a voice of
thunder, “I would like to show
you the sewing-machine that I
built for her out in the garage.
It’s a sturdy, robust and
efficient machine; it will sew
through anything, cloth,
canvas, leather —you name it.”
“And it’s driven by a dirty
old motor - cycle engine,”
wailed Linda piteously. “It
gives off clouds of smoke and
it makes my head ache. If I
don’t leave the door open I’m
liable to die of carbon-
monoxide poisoning. That’s
what he’s trying tcf do—kill me.
Besides, it goes too fast and
tears the clothes.”
Tom was outraged. “It does
not tear the clothes,” he
shouted. “Keep a firm grip on
them and a baby could handle
it. I can see I’m not wanted
here; I’m going out to my
workshop.”
He stomped out. Linda
looked at me with wide,
piteous eyes.
“Oh, Arthur,” was all she
said. The handyman beamed
at us, now that the screen had
stopped rocking, put down his
hammer, and hoped he would
see us again next week.
Asa friend of the family I
a heart-to-heart talk with
Linda that evening, and she
agreed to do as 1 suggested.
Soon everything was ail right
again and life went on as
before.
Tom had built a shack, a
weekender he called it, beside
a lake out in the bush. It
was a case of getting right
away from civilisation. There
was no electricity or gas, no
water except in the lake, no
sanitation, no roads. Tom was
as happy as a sandboy when-
ever he spent his holidays up
there with Linda. They’d catch
fish in a boat Tom had made
and then Tom would have a
swim while Linda fried them
over a kerosene stove.
There were hundreds of trees
to be chopped down to build
things with. If you took a
few bags of cement up with
you in the car you could get
all the sand and gravel you
wanted from the lake. With
Linda to help him mix the
concrete you could really go
to town with projects in wood
and cement —jetties, boat-
houses—all that sort of thing.
Tom and Linda had a
friendly arrangement about it.
She would spend three weeks
with him there on his annual
vacation and then when he
went back to work, she would
go to her mother’s place in
Newcastle to recover.
I never liked doing things
for myself, even though I was
a bachelor, so while they were
away I’d take my holidays and
go home to my people. After
my holidays were over that
year I was taken ill and had to
stay at my parents’ place for
several more weeks. When I
finally got back, Linda and
Tom were home again, looking
reasonably fit and well. They
were bursting to tell me that
there had been a burglary
while we were all on holidays,
and they wanted me to look
through my things to see if I
had lost anything.
All my stuff seemed to be
o.k. and I said so and asked
what they’d had stolen. Tom
told me, very gravely, that the
wireless had been stolen.
Without thinking, I said with
a chuckle, “They’ll be mighty
surprised when they try to
tune it in. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if they brought it back.”
Linda raised her eyebrows at
me and Tom looked annoyed.
“It’s the set that I converted to
short-wave, you know.”

•fiSSK
premiums in 1956 was over
£240 million.
T loyd’s members are kept
up-to-date with informa-
tion on shipping and other
business by a series of regular
publications printed on the
premises by Lloyd’s own
presses.
This information, collected
by more than 1500 agents
spread across the world, flows
night and day in a never-ending
stream to Lloyd’s offices in
Leadenhall Street. The move-
ments of over 13,000 vessels
are reported regularly.
As well as providing infor-
mation for members, Lloyd's
main activity, as a corporation,
is to see that its members have
premises suitable for conduct-
ing insurance business on an
international scale, and to
ensure that they conform to
the high standards of business
integrity that have made
Lloyd’s famous.
This has been attained
mainly by the exceptionally
high standards for admittance
Lloyd's demand of their
members. A candidate apply-
ing for admission as an under-
writing member at Lloyd’s
must be in a position to
deposit £lO,OOO, show liquid
assets of £75,000 and operate
for three years before taking
out any profits —plus paying
the standard entrance-fee of
£500! This results in each
member being bound to share
in the settlement of claims
made against the company.
T loyd’s, 1958, furnishes,
more elaborately, much
the same services as did
Edward Lloyd, and over the
centuries a great feeling of
tradition has been' built up by
its members.
Liveried callers, boxes
reminiscent of the old coffee-
house, the traditional stiff-
paper slips, and even one or
two quill-pens are all to be
seen daily in The Room. Some
of the underwriters use the
initials of Lloyd’s underwriters
long since dead, and these
initials are still binding and
accepted without question.
In the centre of The Room
a red-cloaked caller seated in
a mahogany rostrum 27ft. high
calls the names of brokers or
underwriters wanted by other
members. In the course of a
typical day’s trading he may
call upwards of 4000 names.
Above the caller’s head hangs
the Lutine’s bell (retrieved
from the lost frigate in 1857)
as a symbol of the society’s
dependability. It is sounded
only to obtain silence in The
Room for important announce-
ments —twice if the news is
good, only once if it is bad.
In April of this year the
company moved into its new
building in Lime Street,
ticking-off yet another mile-
stone of its colorful career.
And certainly Edward Lloyd,
in his 17th-century coffee-
house, could not have visual-
ised the growth of his clientele
into what is now, proudly,
Lloyd's—of London.
“Well, naturally. It’s the
only one you had.”
There had been a little mild
bickering about this conver-
sion. Linda liked to listen to
the serials while she was doing
her ironing, and in daytime,
when there wasn’t any tele-
vision. When Tom converted
the set to a short-wave she
couldn't listen to serials any
longer. All she could get was
police-broadcasts, taxi-drivers,
and people telling people in
vans to go to such-and-such a
place and start a car or mend
an electric-stove.
This is all very well at first,
but its entertainment-value
wears a bit thin. Linda was
always at him to change it back
again, but either he wouldn’t or
couldn’t.
Now it was stolen. Secretly
I wondered if Linda had
quietly ditched it so that he’d
have to buy a new one. Tom
took it all frightfully seriously,
and I gathered that he won-
dered if he hadn’t invented
something by accident that was
in the set and was worth
money. He was rather vague
about it. Tom had always had
a yen to invent something, but
it seemed that all the good
things had already been
invented and there wasn’t any-
thing left.
“Well, we’ll have to have
burglar-alarms before we go
away again,” he announced ;
“1 can’t allow all my hard work
to come to nothing.”
“I’m sure you can rig some-
thing with bells and suchlike,”
1 suggested. “That would be
child’s play to a man of your
ability.”
“It’s not as easy as you
think. Certainly I could rig
something so that beils went
off if anyone broke-in. But
what then? The neighbors
would just turn over in bed
and say, ‘Tom’s place is being
broken-into. Good on them.
That’ll teach him to try to
make fireworks in his back-
yard and blow us all up.’ Then
they’d go off to sleep again.”
I looked at Tom with added
respect; he’d got more pers-
picacity than I’d thought.
That's exactly what they would
say.
“I’m not much good at that
sort of thing, Tom, but when
the grapes are ripe on the farm
back home Dad puts down
trip-wires connected to rat-
traps. He solders on a bit of
nail, and it fires a blank cart-
ridge when it goes off. No
one is hurt, but it throws a
helluva scare into all the kids
who try to pinch the grapes.”
“That’s no good,” said Tom
thoughtfully. “It’d probably
set the house on fire.”
“Well, why don’t you use
real guns? You’ve got a couple
of old three-o-three rifles out
there in the shed. If you
loaded them up with blank
cartridges and fixed-up some
trip-wires you could scare the
daylights out of anyone who
broke-in. You could even
spread it around that you’re
using live bullets. It’d dis-
courage the people around here
from trying it on.”
Tom looked at me with
grudging admiration. “You’ve
got a head on your shoulders,
boy. I might even make a
handyman out of you yet.”
But he was quite wrong;
that sort of thing is quite out
of my line.
Of course, I wasn’t there at
the time, but I believe that
when they went up the lake
the next time there was a whole
spider’s-web of nylon fishing-
lines around the house. People
said you couldn’t step inside
the house without getting in a
hopeless tangle. There were
pulleys and trip-wires and
Heaven knows what else. I
don't think anyone could have
stepped into that house with-
out being a very surprised man.
/’"'ertainly Tom was a very
surprised man v/hen he let
himself into his house coming
back from his holidays—as he
stepped inside he got a bullet
through the chest. He man-
aged to stagger out to the street,
and there died.
The neighbors sent a tele-
gram for Linda to come down
from Newcastle, and she sent
me a wire to come back from
South Australia, where my
people live. 1 was only too
happy to do what I could to
help in the whole sad business.
The police, if you please,
thought it was murder when
they were summoned by the
passer-by who found Tom
lying there in the street. But
the neighbors were only too
eager to talk—by the time
Linda and I arrived the police
were able to tell us exactly
what had happened.
The coroner brought in a
verdict of “Death by misadven-
ture,” and to his discredit made
a few scathing comments
about people who meddle with
things it’s not their business to
meddle with. Really, I agree
with him, but I don’t like to
speak ill of the dead. The
neighbors, uncharitable lot, aIL
seemed to think that he got
what he deserved.
Now, I think, you will
understand why I have such
an aversion to these do-it-your-
self sessions and why I was so
rude as to switch-over without
asking you. You sure you
didn’t mind?
After this very funny show
at eight you can have your
choice of a variety programme
or a murder play. Linda and
I don't usually watch the
murders ; they always end-up
with some poor devil being
dragged off to the gas-chamber
or the electric-chair. It gives
you the horrors. But you
watch it if you want to.
I beg your pardon? Blank
cartridges? Oh, I see what you
mean. Well, Linda and I
didn’t see much point in telling
the coroner that he intended to
use blank cartridges after he’d
told all the neighbors that he
was using live ones. The man’s
dead, after all.
Anyway, Linda and I are
very happy here since we were
married. And you know how
people talk.
You’d prefer the variety
show? Good.


European Common Market
Freer trade is a catch-phrase that
is on the lips of many politicians
in many countries, but, like many
other phrases which sound simple,
it has different meanings on different
lips.
This, after all, is not surprising.
The innocent little words “absolutely
free” in Section 92 of the Commonwealth
Constitution have been the subject of
more legal argument than all the other
clauses of that document put together ;
even now there is probably no Consti-
tutional lawyer who could explain their
purport in less than a chapter.
Talk of “freeing” trade always has a
lofty ring of idealism about it, but when
the talking gets down to the stage of
actually making binding agreements prac-
tical issues necessarily intrude. In
approaching the subject each country
naturally favors the type of freeing that
will bring the most benefit to its own
people. A certain amount of give-and-
take is predicated, but no one is eager
to do too much of the giving, though
all are prepared to be on hand for the
take. An agreement involving a number
of countries may well be of benefit to
all of them, though in varying degrees,
but it is probable that the advantages
gained from it are at the expense of
other countries outside the agreement.
These arguments applied to the Ottawa
Agreement, and they were factors affect-
ing deliberations at the Montreal con-
ference last September—a section of the
press attacked the Federal Government
for sending what it considered was a
weak delegation incapable of coping with
the more numerous British team.
Decisions at Montreal
TYTO spectacular results were expected
from the Montreal talks and none
came. The conference “reaffirmed the
common objective of freer trade and pay-
ments.” It agreed that “dollar discrimina-
tion should be progressively reduced and
ended as soon as possible.” There was
also agreement “on the great value of
the existing system of preferences and
the importance of maintaining it.”
Various bilateral trade-agreements be-
tween individual Commonwealth coun-
tries are to be reviewed as a result of
conference decisions; these affect
Canada-Australia, Canada-West Indies,
Australia-New Zealand and U.K.-New
Zealand. Important to this country was
the assurance that the United Kingdom
intends “to maintain free and unre-
stricted entry for nearly all Common-
wealth goods as an important part of
the preferential system.” This was clearly
an answer to Commonwealth misgivings
about Britain’s negotiations for a
European Free Trade Area. In this con-
nection the conference “emphasised the
need that a European Common Market
and European Free Trade Area should
be outward-looking in the interests of
an expanding world trade and world
economy. Mr. Maudling, U.K. Pay-
master-General, had used almost the
same words a few months earlier.
The European Common Market grew
out of the European Coal and Steel
Community, which was formed about
seven years ago to pool the coal- and
steel - resources of France, Western
Germany, Italy, Holland, Belgium and
Luxembourg. The success of the scheme
encouraged a move in 1955 to expand
E.C.S.C. into a common market for all
goods produced in the six countries.
The six countries agreed to adopt the
Common Market plan in three stages,
each of four years’ duration, the first
to come into operation on January 1,
1959. With a population of 163-million
and an annual output of 250-million
tons of coal and 60-million tons of steel
on which is based a very diversified and
highly developed structure of secondary
industry and with a solid agricultural
output the Common Market promises to
be a formidable economic unit.
Free Trade Area
\X7hen the Coal and Steel Community
’’ was established the United King-
dom declined to join, but in December,
1954, it signed an agreement establishing
a Standing Council of Association con-
sisting of four British representatives and
four representatives of the High
Authority, the governing body of
E.C.S.C. Britain also remained aloof
from the Common Market, but put for-
ward a proposal of its own —a European
Free Trade Area which would comprise
the six E.C.S.C. countries and Britain,
the Scandinavian countries, Austria and
Switzerland. This was later extended to
include the whole 17 countries of the
Organisation for European Economic
Co-operation.
Although the two schemes have simi-
lar objects there are two fundamental
differences. The Common Market coun-
tries will progressively reduce tariffs
among themselves, ultimately abolishing
them. They will also fix a common tariff
to be levied by all members on goods
coming into the Common Market area
from the outside world. The British plan
proposes that the United Kingdom and
other Western European countries should
join thd Common Market with reserva-
tions—the chief one being that they
should retain their individual rights to
fix their own external tariffs. Britain also
insists that agricultural products shall
not be included in the general trade-
agreement. Both these points are of
great importance to Australia and other
Commonwealth countries.
Last April, although no firm decisions
were made in the discussions between
the two bodies, Mr. Maudling claimed
that agreement was in sight on a number
of points. There were further talks in
July and at the end of that month he
told the House of Commons that the
United Kingdom Government had made
it clear from the start that agriculture
could not be included in the Free Trade
Area. He said a separate agreement for
improving trade in agricultural products
was being negotiated. The general
agreement would be further discussed
in October and he was hopeful that
there would be “substantial agreement
by the end of the year.” His hopes
don't seem likely to be realised. So far
the British and French views seem to
be irreconcilable. In Montreal Mr.
Maudling said that Britain would do its
utmost to ensure that the new economic
organisation in Europe would not re-
duce European purchases of agricultural
commodities from the outside world.
Britain had always made it clear to
Europe that there would be an open
door for Commonwealth products in the
United Kingdom and that existing Com-
monwealth preferences in Britain for
food, drink and tobacco would remain.
In October, at the 13th session of
GATT in Geneva, Sir David Eccles,
president of the U.K. Board of Trade,
said that it was up to the Common
Market countries to show that their pro-
posals were not designed to promote
economic expansion in Europe at the
expense of other members of GATT, in
particular the underdeveloped areas.
The six countries should be prepared to
discuss how to reduce the harmful effects
of special treatment given to their over-
seas territories upon the U.K. colonies
and other producers of tropical products.
Negotiations between Britain and the
Common Market were to have been re-
sumed on November 19, but following
a statement by French Information
Minister Sousteile that the Free Trade
Area proposals “seemed unacceptable,”
Britain announced that they had been
postponed indefinitely. There the matter
rests at the moment, with the Common
Market due to begin operations on
January 1 and the wider British scheme
shelved.
Immediately after the announcement
of the breakdown of negotiations, Allan
Noble, U.K. Minister for Foreign Affairs,
told the U.S. Foreign Trade Council in
New York that Britain saw danger arising
if the Common Market, “which implies
discrimination by six countries against
their associates in the Organisation for
European Economic Co-operation is not
complemented by a free-trade area of
all 17 countries of 0.E.E.C.” He said all
these countries were willing to join the
six in the larger Free Trade Area.
Remarks made by Prince Bernard of
the Netherlands a few days earlier sug-
gest strongly that Holland, for one, does
not see eye to eye with France on this
subject and would welcome the British
plan. The Common Market will be
a most interesting experiment, and the
interest in it won't be confined to Europe.

7he Kramer K.O*
Supporting last week’s deci-
sion by the Lawn Tennis
Association of Australia to
impose* a complete ban on
Jack Kramer’s professional
troupe using official courts in
Australia, L.T.A.A. president
D. M. Ferguson implied that
the idea was to strike a blow
against the inroads of profes-
sional tennis.
“I refuse to allow a com-
petitor to be given advan-
tages,” he said, and went on
to attack Kramer’s poaching
of top Australian amateurs and
to suggest that Kramer was to
blame for the big decline in
attendances at the major
amateur championships. He
cited Sedgman, McGregor,
Hartwig, Rosewall and Hoad,
all lost to professionalism in
the past six years.
Well now, has that done our
tennis any harm? The fact is
that Australia has never domi-
nated world tennis as
thoroughly and as consistently
as over this period. If any-
thing, the snipping-off of the
top players every now and
then seems to have had the
same beneficial effect as prun-
ing a rose-bush—encouraging
fresh young growth.
“In Adelaide last week the
attendance for the South Australian
championships could only be
described as deplorable. There
could be other reasons than
Kramer. But I feel the impact of
professional tennis has been really
serious,” said Ferguson. Surely he
doesn’t seriously suggest that the
people who stayed away in droves
from the S.A. championships did so
because Kramer’s professional circus
will be playing in the same city some
weeks hence.
The explanation is simply that
they stayed away because there was
nothing to attract them. The
present crop of top Australian
players may be technically the best
in the world, but they’re also about
the most colorless. They just don’t
grip public interest. There’s nothing
about them to make any of them
either specially popular or unpopu-
lar. A championship final between
any two of the top four or five
promises no fireworks; nothing but
a number of sets of precise,
mechanical textbook tennis. That
the L.T.A.A. itself tacitly recognises
this is shown by their importing
this year a near-record number of
overseas players to try to ginger-up
the State and national champion-
ships.
Three of the State associations —
Queensland, South Australia and
Tasmania—were satisfied with the
money they had made through
Kramer in the past, and with the
deal they had made with him for
his coming tour. But three others
—W.A., and more particularly
N.S.W. and Victoria —tried to
squeeze a bit more out of the
lemon. Kramer dug his toes in on
their demands. When it came up
for discussion at the L.T.A.A. meet-
ing, delegates were evenly divided
on the question, and president Fer-
guson used his casting-vote against
Kramer.
In short, last year the price was
right and Kramer was welcome to
hire L.T.A.A. tennis arenas. This
year the two biggest and wealthiest
State associations try for a bigger
price, lose out, and thereupon last
year’s welcome paying-guest becomes
a menace against whom amateur
tennis must be guarded.
A Victorian delegate, supporting
the ban on Kramer, complained:
“Although the L.T.A.V. received
£9OOO from Kramer last summer,
he put in his own pocket between
£37,000 and £40,000.” In the enter-
tainment world that would be
regarded as a fair percentage for
“hire of theatre.” The N.S.W.
association last year collected £7OOO
from Kramer, and even with that
did not cut even for the year—
they were a couple of hundred
down. It can be imagined how
much the b'unce from Kramer could
mean to many of the smaller and
less-financial associations. And it
can be imagined how the South
Australian delegates at the L.T.A.A.
conference must have felt while
listening to the president using the
“deplorable attendance at the South
Australian championships” as an
argument for depriving the S.A.
association of the chance to make-
up the deficit with their expected
collect from Kramer.
Present writer’s guess is
that when Australian tennis
authorities start making-up
their accounts next year they’re
in for a rude discovery—that,
far from being responsible for
the ,drop-off in amateur-tennis
revenues, Kramer’s tourists for
the past season or two have
been cushioning Australian
amateur associations from the
real financial effects of a fall-
off in attendance at all sports
in general and a loss of in-
terest in amateur tennis in par-
ticular.
So much for Jack Kramer,
professional tennis - promoter,
versus what he was moved to
describe as “very capable back-
alley fighters.” But there is
another aspect of Kramer's
present presence in these parts
that calls for comment. That
is his anomalous position as
official coach - adviser to the
American Davis Cup team.
For the U.S. tennis authorities to
make _ such an official appointment
in view of Kramer’s peculiarly
delicate associations with Australian
tennis seems at the very least tact-
less. But for the official coach of
the American Davis Cup team to
hire a leading Australian Davfs Cup
player in Mervyn Rose to join his
professional troupe a few weeks
before the Davis Cup challenge
round is something more than tact-
less. The U.S. amateur authorities
should never have made such an
appointment; in his own interests
Kramer shouldn’t have allowed him-
self to be appointed ; and he should
certainly have severed his official
connection with the U.S. Cup team
before signing-up Rose.
The first rounds of the singles in
the N.S.W. tennis-titles produced
more than the usual “upsets.”
Unseeded Sydney junior Martin
Mulligan beat the Swede Ulf
Schmidt, who had eliminated Neale
Fraser in the S.A. titles, and later
defeated the Italian. Merlo. The
other Swede, Jan Lundquist,
straig'ht-sets conqueror of Ashley
Cooper in S.A., was beaten by
unseeded Graham Lovett. The 18-
year-old American Earl Buchholz
beat in straight sets Australian
Davis Cup player Mai Anderson,
while the American Ham Richard-
son went out per less-favored
Australian Bob Mark. Fraser was
defeated in straight sets by the
young Spaniard Gimeno.

At Warwick Farm
Leading Sydney trainer T. J.
Smith had a field-day at War-
wick Farm, his horses landing
four of the eight races on
Saturday’s card. Three 'of
them Marksman, Plymouth
and Great Blaze —were strongly
supported, and there was fair
support also for Big Jake, who
ran away with the Junior
Maiden Stakes for colts and
geldings.
Big Jake is named after
American professional tennis
promoter Jack Kramer, who
left the White City courts to
see the gelding win. He hadn't
set eyes on Big Jake until a
couple of hours before the
race, but he had acquired a
part-owner interest in the
youngster a few days earlier.
The other part-owners are
George Ryder and D. Chrystal
snr. and jnr. Despite his No.
20 possie at the barrier and the
fact that it was his first run
under silk, Big Jake got away
well, was soon taken over to
the rails by F. Leman, and was
not afterwards troubled, though
he ran a bit wide in the final
furlong. Maybe the good price
at first on offer (20 to 1) com-
pensated the other big Jake
for his tennis troubles. The
youngster is a Newtown
Wonder (imp.), from April
Shower.
Trainer E. D. (Peter) Law-
son won two races at Warwick
Farm, one with rank outsider
Amneris, the other with the
lightly fancied Carrus, who's
raced by former paddock book-
maker Jack Shaw. Amneris
nosed Cornelius from the
Camden Handicap, chief sprint
of the afternoon (Teranyan was
a disappointing favorite).
Carrus, making her racing
debut, also won by a nose,
beating the well-fancied Lil-
mari and her own stablemate,
Parabola. Carrus, who had
done some smart trackwork at
Randwick, won by superior
pace. She is by Nilo (imp.)
from Golden Chariot by
Golden Sovereign (imp.) from
Speed by Marconigram (imp.).
Marksman, winner of the
Farm Novice Handicap with
9st., and Aqua Boy, winner of
the November Handicap with
8.5, are possible starters in the
A.J.C.’s Summer Cup (H mile)
to be run on Boxing Day. The
Farm Novice field were a
moderate lot. Moore gave
Marksman plenty of time over
the 11 furlongs; the gelding
was one of the last of 12
runners until the pace was
clapped on near the home-
turn ; then he came through
for an easy win. It’s a sharp
step up from Novice company
to the Summer Cup, but
Marksman should get in with
a light weight, and he has
proved he can stay. Aqua Boy,
who also beat a weak lot, has

twice won at 12 furlongs at
Randwick.
Making a reappearance after
'a spell of a few months, Rose-
hill-trained Royal Feast, raced
by Ken Ranger, would have
lifted much money from the
fielders had he won. Evidently
the smart sprinter had shown
trainer Col Papworth some-
thing to go on ; he was backed
for some thousands. He led
in the straight, but tired and
filled third place to favorite
Plymouth. Anyway, Royal
Feast’s run seemed sound
enough to remember for next
time out in similar company.
Racegoers won’t be going
to Warwick Farm again until
the last Saturday in February
(28th), and there will be only
one more meeting there after
that date till the end of April ;
that will be on March 21. This
seems a long time between
fixtures at the course, but evi-
dently the A.J.C. committee
realises that people don’t fancy
going to the Farm on hot
summer days. Last Saturday’s
fixture was held in ideal
breezy weather, but most of the
19,000 crowd would have
appreciated a much earlier
finish to the programme of
eight events. The A.J.C. should
try to arrange to finish no
later than 4.30 at any meeting
on a Saturday—getting back
to the city from the Farm
often takes the pleasure out of
the trip to this picturesque
track.
With the addition of the try-
out “twilight” fixtures, Turf
folk will have an overdose of
racing in January—meetings
each Saturday and on three
Wednesdays, and a couple of
holidays thrown in. Then, of
course, there will be provincial
fixtures. Maybe punters’ money
will run short before the month
is out. Some club or other is
bound to suffer by this surfeit
of racing.

Dr. L. Halberstarter is
racing a smart two-year-old in
Brisbane. Named New
Romance, the filly cleared out
with the Q.T.C.’s Piccaninny
Stakes at the Queensland Cup
meeting last Saturday. The
youngster, bred in New Zea-
land, has an interesting pedi-
gree. Her * sire, Knight’s
Romance (imp.), bred in Eire
in 1949, won in New Zealand
before being retired to the
stud. He is a half-brother to
Admiral’s Luck. Beech Hill,
dam of New Romance, is by
Defoe (imp.) from Marausia by
“How did this one come to be in the photo-finish photos ?”
Arausio (imp.). Beech Hill,
lightly raced, has thrown five
winners.
The Queensland Cup (two
miles, and dating back to
1878) was won easily by 7-to-l
Chilly Glance from Prince
Marco (11 to 4) and Cala-
mander (10 to 1) in the smart
time of 3.22 Blue Vest’s 3.21
in 1950 stands as the race
record. Chilly Glance is a five-
year-old mare by Passing
Glance (imp.), sire of scores
of winners in the northern State
(he’s a son of Nearco). Early
Spear, dam of the Cup winner,
is by Spearfelt from Early
Force by High Force (imp.).
Early Force has thrown several
other winners.
Famed's Eclipse Stakes
At one time the Eclipse
Stages was known as the Con-
solation Stakes, and its £3OOO
prizemoney is a nice stake for
the horses just short of the top-
class events during the spring.
Saturday’s running of the
event went to the Delville
Wood-Future Fame four-year-
old Famed.
Last year’s winner of the
Eclipse Roman Holiday—
was also by Delville Wood.
Bill Williamson was at his
best on Famed. The four-
year-old has a powerful finish-
ing run, and Williamson, who
had the gelding well back at
the home-turn, judged his
mount's run to a nicety, land-
ing Famed a winner from the
consistent but unlucky Saran-
over.
Trainer Fred Hoysted had a
lot of pleasure from Famed’s
success. Owner in partnership
with Mrs. T. T. Bain, he
selected the gelding at the Syd-
ney sales and secured him for
950gns. It was the first time
one of his charges had won
the Eclipse, although he still
remembers wryly that he
trained Donaster for the race
in 1937 when that galloper was
first over the line but lost on
protest.
Even the best of jockeys can
ride an ill-judged race, and
most racegoers at Caulfield,
who had applauded Williamson
for his handling of Famed in
the Eclipse, were puzzled by
that rider’s apparent lack of
judgment in the following
event, the six-furlongs Ross-
town Plate. Williamson rode
Misting, but instead of making
use of the grey colt’s sizzling
speed he had Misting at the
rear of the field until the last
half-furlong. From that point
the colt finished brilliantly, but
just failed to catch outsider
Pride of Colorado.
The track at Caulfield is the
fastest in Melbourne in good
weather, and on Saturday Pride
of Colorado, who had never
been rated more than a
moderate, covered the six
furlongs in 1.10.3/10 just
1 / lOsec.. outside Sir Pyrean’s
course record.
Misting seems to be return-
ing to his best. He dead-
heated with Seabeau at his
previous start, and looked un-
lucky to lose on Saturday.
It is not often a maiden
performer starts at odds -on
against better credentialled
opponents, but the lightly-
raced Count Tassia carried that
much of the racegoers’ con-
fidence in the sedond Pelham
Handicap at Caulfield. He
justified their support by win-
ning easily. Saturday's run
was only the colt’s fourth start,
but he had given notice of the
win by finishing a good second
to Chipperfield dow'n the
straight-six at Flemington on
Derby Day. One of Count
Tassia’s four owners, V. New-
ton, bred the colt, who is by
Neapolitan from Joystream
Theo Lewis, who prepares
Count Tassia, is a shrewd
judge, and he believes the colt
will be very good.
No win throughout Mel-
bourne's spring racing received
as enthusiastic applause as
followed Wheel’s success in the
Stansmore Two-year-old at
Caulfield. The applause,
though, was not for the filly,
who started at double - figure
odds, but for her rider, Jack
Purtell. It was his first win-
ning ride since he returned
from England on Cup Day.
Wheel, owned by a Sydney
group, M. J. and Mrs. Stevens
and Mrs. E. A. McConat (all
of whom flew to Melbourne
for the race), is by Nilo from

The Trots
On Saturday night Katoomba
pacer Sir Raider moved a step
closer to qualifying for Cup-
class when he won the Harold
Park Handicap by a length
from the fast-finishing Noble
Western and Main Power.
In the first Qualifying Stakes
11-to-8-on favorite Great Wyn
went down by a long neck to
Mustard (14 to 1). Running
second till the final lap with
Great Wyn trailing him,
Mustard took the lead and just
lasted long enough. Favorite
Tungston was beaten into
fourth place by 20-to-l Prince
Power, with Star Peak second
and Streak’s Son third, in the
Second Qualifying Stakes. Star
Peak broke badly at the start
and ran last for two laps. It
was a very good performance
to get within three-quarters of
a length of the winner, who,
however, also broke in the
middle stages.
r * #
Other Sports
The M.C.C.’s batting stars on
the first day of the game against
an Australian XI were those
two consistent (and stroke-
making) batsmen, May and
Graveney. May, unsure against
N.S.W. in the previous match, after
his lay-off through injury, showed
himself in his innings of 140 to be
back to his top. Graveney, who
has hardly failed in Australia, made
70, and was associated with his
skipper in a fourth-wicket stand of
149 at a run a minute. Cowdrey
failed again—he has not been very
successful since his 78 and 100
not-out against the Combined XI in
Perth.
Though one or two of them have
swung a hefty and unscientific bat
on occasion (as Trueman’s 53
against the Combined XI in Perth),
the M.C.C. admittedly has a long
“tail”; “five out all out,” it’s been
said. Still, there’ll be no great need
for the tail to do any wagging if
it does in the Tests what it did to
the strong Australian XI batting side
-last Saturday—routed them for 128.
“Veryl”: Tall W.A. pace-bowler
Horrie Gorringe was a regular mem-
ber of W.A.’s teams a few years
back, but these days has a lot of
opposition from the State’s fine crop
oi new-ball bowlers, like Gaunt,
Strauss, Hoare and Slater. How-
ever, he has played in three of the
games on W.A.’s eastern tour, but
twice in the same way he’s let him-
self down badly. Against Victoria
he missed a “sitter” caught-and-
bowled off Maddocks when the
’keeper was 6 —and he went on to
113 not-out. Had Gorringe held the
catch, W.A. would probably have
won on the first-innings instead of
losing by that margin. Then, against
ScA., he spilled an easy one from
Favell, when 9, off his own bowling
—and he, too, went on to a century
(104).
“Keima”: Speaking at a
welcome-home from the 1953
tour of England, given him by
his then Melbourne pennant-
club, an Australian Test-
cricketer, as reported in the
“Age” (20/11 / ’53), stated that
Statham was faster than True-
man but that Fred was more
dangerous because Statham
“bowled too much at the
stumps.” Others have said
more-or-less the same of Stat-
ham. Without going into com-
parisons between the two
speedsters, it must be acknow-
ledged that Statham’s Test-
record is at least as impressive
as Trueman’s, and that his
stump-aiming policy has often
paid-off—as, for instance, in
the first innings of the M.C.C.’s
recent game against Victoria,
when he took 7-47, six clean-
bowled and one l.b.w.
“Frangeo”: Eleven-year-old
Gary Jones, playing in the
Casino (N.S.W.) under-15
junior cricket . competition,
took a hat-trick in each of the
first three comp, games this
year. At that stage he had the
amazing bowling average of
4.1 —25 wickets for 102 runs.
Norman von Nida returned
to the winning-list when he
brilliantly won the Orange
Ampol £5OO golf-tournament,
finishing two strokes ahead of
Sid Cowling. The Von’s 36-
hole total of 135 included an
equal-course-record 67. Cow-
ling and Len Woodward also
returned 67’s. The amateur
event went to Sid Lloyd
(Bathurst) with 149, one stroke
better than J. Bell (Cowra).
• • • m
“Rossby”: “Spoke’s” com-
ment on Russell Mockridge—
that “a ‘Mocka’ does not come
along every day of the year”
(B. 29/10/”58) could also
apply to Hubert Opperman,
mentioned in the same
par, “Oppy,” among other
things, three times (1924, 1926
and 1929) set fastest-time, from
scratch, in the Warrnambool-
Melbourne road-race. In 1928,
in Europe, he won the 80l d’Or,
the 24-hour track-race, setting
a mileage-record, and 1931 won
the 726-mile Paris-Brest-Paris,
a race so gruelling that it
is only held once each decade.
He set innumerable world-
records for both paced and
unpaced rides, many of which
still stand, and some of his
feats of endurance cycling are
almost incredible.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
NATO STRAINS
/Commenting on the Nato
stresses and strains ac-
cented by Montgomery’s
criticisms and by General de
Gaulle’s moves to raise
France’s status, “Yorkshire
Post” notes that “it is salutary
sometimes, no less in interna-
tional affairs than in domestic
matters, to recall that politics
is the art of the possible”:
“This is a truism which goads
all extremists and all idealogues
into fury; but nobody can
claim to be a statesman who
does not keep it very carefully
in mind. The political-diplo-
matic bewilderment, bordering
on dismay, which seems at
present to afflict the relations
of a number of European
countries with each other, with
Britain and with the United
States, might perhaps have
been avoided—or at any rate
diminished —if the practical
limitations of certain grand and
spacious concepts had been
more consistently recognised.
“In essence,’ most of the
arguments, whether they are
about Nato or the European
Free Trade Area or about
General de Gaulle’s proposal
for a Three-Power executive
council to control global
strategy, boil-down to differ-
ences about the surrender of
sovereignty.
“Astringent and tactless as
Lord Montgomery’s criticisms
of Nato may have been, they
have served to provoke wide-
spread recognition of the fact
that all is far from well. They
have injected a cold draught
of realism into an atmosphere
which in recent years has
become increasingly . vague,
academic and woolly. But
many of the present reactions
to the Field-Marshal’s criticism
are disquietingly familiar.
“When the weaknesses of a
regional military defensive
alliance are exposed—either by
events or by someone perform-
ing, as Lord Montgomery did,
an emperor’s new clothes act
—a psychological defence-
mechanism comes instantly into
play. There is a great spate
of eagerly reassuring comment
about reorganisation and
realignment. This happened
when the obvious stresses to
which Seato is subject made
themselves felt; it was the
almost instantaneous response
when the Iraqi coup d’etat
blew the Baghdad Pact into
rags and tatters. The other day
it was being asserted with the
utmost confidence that Lord
Montgomery’s assault had
merely given impetus to exist-
ing proposals to improve and
widen Nato ‘with new emphasis
on political and economic
planning to be integrated in
overall strategy.’
“The last phrase is a classic
example of international
London “Daily Express”
THE GOVERNOR OF CYPRUS.
political gobbledegook. The
value of criticism like Lord
Montgomery’s is that it shows-
up this dismal jargon as utterlv
meaningless.
“General de Gaulle, though
nobody could ever call him
impish and though he has a
grasp of statecraft never granted
to Lord Montgomery, has
something of a similar impact.
He is a realist as well as a
romantic patriot. His sug-
gestion of an American-British-
French supreme council to deal
with global strategic issues has
proved to be a catalyst of con-
siderable consequence.
“The core of the argument is
clear. It is about sovereignty.
Because the argument is being
conducted courteously and
temperately (the British
Government’s share in the
exchanges has been especially
constructive as well as friendly),
its ultimate effects will
probably be beneficial. Nations,
like smaller communities and
like individuals, are only per-
suaded to surrender a measure
of control over their actions,
and the foreseeable conse-
quences of those actions, if
they are convinced that such a
surrender will be in their best
interests.
“In the formation of supra-
national organisations, with
executive as distinct from
merely consultative functions,
it is necessary to proceed step
by step. In Western Europe
the principle of national
sovereignty is extremely deep-
rooted ; it has been fought for
again and again ; it is, in fact,
what European history has
been about in the past 500
years. It cannot be lightly or
swiftly set aside even if some
of its manifestations seem
troublesome on. occasions.”
In further comment on the
de Gaulle suggestion, London
“Daily Telegraph” considers
that “the present danger
appears to be that General de
Gaulle, reaching for the nuclear
bomb and a seat at the Anglo-
American table, may tear
through the mesh of relation-
ships woven with France’s
neighbors in the past 10
years”:
“It was the hope of many
that France’s policy was to
create Europe, with herself in
the chair. It was the hope of
some that the United States and
Britain might one day be
joined in their military and
political councils by a French-
man —sometimes by a German
or an Italian, or a Nether-
lander —representing the Six of
Europe. It was certainly
planned at one stage that
the defence burdens of the
Six should be fairly and
sensibly shared. Is all this now
in the melting-pot?
“The Six might do worse
than reconsider the work done
up to five years ago for the
abortive ‘defence community,’
in the light of their present
and future military require-
ments and of what has been
already agreed in Euratom.
In other words, they might
contemplate forming their own
defence club within the bigger
Nato group. Then some of
the problems looming ahead
would look less sinister. What
the Americans might hesitate
to give to France and still
more to Germany—might be
given to an integrated Euro-
pean Defence Ministry,
whether it be secrets, com-
mands, money or material.
Certainly only a Europe united
for defence can compete in the
space age.”
Setting down an American
viewpoint—and recommending
another summit-conference—
that able “New York Times”
writer C. L. Sulzberger points
out that, of the many changes
within the Allied camp during
this year, “the most important
was the creation of a new
French Republic”:
“Eisenhower has not seen
de Gaulle since he resumed
power. A Nato consultation
would present an admirable
occasion for direct talks. The
problems that have suddenly
erupted inside the coalition
again call for urgent measures.
France is demanding revision
of the political machinery.
Germany worries about the im-
plications of these requests.
“Greece, after protracted

This year, 1958, has been one in which
Australia has signally remembered the greatness of
its sons in aviation.
A memorial to Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith
was opened at Adelaide airport for the housing of
the Vickers Vimy biplane in which they made the
first flight from England to Australia.
The Southern Cross, in which Sir Charles
Kingsford Smith. Charles Ulm and their two
American companions first spanned the Pacific,
found its resting place at Eagle Farm. Brisbane, at
the very field where they put it down at the end of
their historic flight from Oakland. California,
in 1928.
A special flight from Sydney to Christchurch
(N.Z.) in September marked the thirtieth anniversary
of their first aerial crossing of the Tasman a few
months later.
Probably no other period has produced so
much in real extension of the lines of world air
travel as 1927-28. It was in 1928 that Queensland’s
Bert Hinkler made his famous solo flight in a
fragile craft from England to Australia.
A year earlier the American. Charles A.
Lindbergh, had made the first non-stop flight across
the Atlantic in the “Spirit of St. Louis.” linking by
air for the first time, and alone, the continents of
America and Europe.
It was my good fortune to have had the
Australian aviators as my friends, and the rpemory
of these men has been very much with me recently
as I have been travelling the international lines they
first tracked —routes along which a busy traffic will
soon be serviced almost wholly by jet aircraft.
Such has been the achievement of a short thirty
years —of fewer than forty years if we take the
marking date back to the epic flight of the Smith
brothers in 1919.
It is an advance that parallels the progress of
Man in every modern sphere. The pace is swift,
the altitudes are high, in the world of our time.
And Australia has to go on rising to an earned
greatness, taking itself on and above the occasional
turbulence: just as our airmen did in* our name,
eagerly and fearlessly, in the realm of flight.

Nato negotiations seeking to
settle the savage Cyprus argu-
ment, suddenly torpedoed
chances of ending this dispute.
As a consequence the wound
in the alliance’s Eastern flank
is graver than ever.'
“A small but ugly squabble
between England and Iceland
remains to be resolved. If it
is allowed to fester, the entire
strategic position could be
embarrassed. Nato policies
toward the nervous Middle
East must still be harmonised.
And, inside the coalition, there
is pressure for an altered com-
mand structure.
“At last year's summit-con-
ferenceithe problems were mili-
tary and psychological. Russia
had leaped ahead in the arma-
ments race by its missile break-
through. Our frightened part-
ners wanted reassurances from
us, and we needed their co-
operation to provide this.
“But the reasons for a
second summit-conference are
of another sort. The United
States managed Brilliantly to
regain its previous weapons
ascendancy by satellite and
moon - rocket programmes.
And, whether wisely or un-
wisely, it showed military self-
confidence in the 1 face of
Communist threats by inter-
ventions in Lebanon and
Quemoy.
“The reasons this time are
primarily political. They con-
cern the Allies themselves,
their attitudes towards one
another rather than their atti-
tudes towards Moscow. And
in that particular realm Eisen-
hower, both during and after
the war, showed himself pecu-
liarly effective. He is a supreme
conciliator among bickering
friends.”

done in the past few years
would, have prevented this
dangerous Russian penetration
of the Middle East through the
devices of economic warfare ;
but it is certain that we in the
United States have to wake-
up to what it may mean.
“If the Russians go through
with their* loan, which in its
present stage would amount to
about one-quarter of the
foreign exchange needed by
Cairo to build the dam, their
penetration of the United Arab
Republic might well achieve
domination of that country’s
affairs. However sincere Presi-
dent Nasser may be in his
protestations that Cairo will
remain ‘neutral’ and under no
one's influence, Western or
Russian, he will find it increas-
ingly hard to maintain such
independence as he ties the
United Arab Republic more
and more closely to Soviet
Russia’s economic domina-
tion.”

London “Daily Telegraph ” :
“The Western Powers have no
inclination to complain, having
themselves withdrawn their
own offer some two years ago.
This decision was taken for
very good reasons, but at the
risk that it might be only a
question of time before Russia
stepped into the gap. In refus-
ing to allow ourselves to be
blackmailed we dared Col.
Nasser and Mr. Khrushchev to
do their Aswan dam’dest,
which they have now proceeded
to do. The sum involved
£35 million should at lehst
provide Egypt with enough
foreign exchange to allow her
to begin work on this gigantic
enterprise. Contrary to what
Nasser proclaimed when he
seized the Canal, his loot has
not enabled her to do so. The
Western offer, of course, „was
more than three times larger.
But in propaganda terms the
country which enables the
scheme to get started will.in-
evitably earn the most grati-
tude.”

London “Observer”: “In
cold-war terms, the Soviet
loan is a political setback for
us [the West] and a gain for
the Russians. But it is more
important for us all that con-
structive enterprises such as
the High Dam should be got
under way. whoever helps pay
for them. There is no reason
why the West and the Soviet
bloc should not share in this
help. But the first step is to
break the vicious circle of
political suspicions.”

about $1250 million, of which
$450 million will be in foreign
currency. But it seems likely
that, having got themselves
involved in the project at the
first stage, the Russians will
not in the last resort withhold
the money needed for the later
stages—though naturally they
may demand that Egypt pays
the appropriate ‘political price.’
And there is, of course, always
the possibility that some of
the remaining $3OO million of
the foreign-currency cost will

‘‘Yorkshire Post” : “It is a
critically important develop-
ment. It brings the Soviet
Union right on to the centre
of the stage in Africa, at a
time when the Western Powers
are still disunited and in con-
fusion and retreat. To a
revolutionary regime such as
Nasser’s, a positive, ‘dynamic’
policy is essential. The tawdry
empire which he dignifies with
the title of United Arab
Republic cannot, however, exist
without the waters of the Nile,
which for a considerable dis-
tance are under the control of
the Sudan. As soon as the
main thrust of Nasser’s
‘dynamic’ policy is directed
southwards up the Nile Valley,
the Sudan’s independence and
integrity are in jeopardy. When
the United Arab Republic is
joined by Russia, for Russia’s
own purposes, the indications
are clear that the Sudan is
intended to be the next point
of challenge. The Sudanese
are not unready or irresolute ;
it is to be hoped that the
Western Powers are also awake
to the danger.”

“Manchester Guardian” :
“By asking the Soviet Govern-
ment for aid during his visit
to Russia, Marshal Amer, a
vice-president of the United
Arab Republic, is making a
political gesture comparable
with President Nasser’s pur-
chase of Czechoslovak arms
three years ago. Economically,
400-million roubles does not
bring the dam much nearer. It
is better than a smack in the
eye (or an invasion of Suez),
but even at the official rate of
exchange it is not much more
than a third of what Egypt
expected two years ago from
the United States, Britain,
and the World Bank. Nor does
it ensure agreement with the
Sudan, on which the whole
project depends. What Marshal
Amer was doing most probably
was to proclaim that his
Government had written-off
the West.”
Edinburgh Scotsman” : “The
Egyptian press are apparently
asserting that the Western
nat'ons have missed the bus.
But they ought not to be too
sure cf themselves, because in
another two years or so it may
turn out that Egypt has taken
a w'rong turning, and that it is
she herself who has missed
the bus. The fact is that the
Russian loan of £33 million
will meet only a very small
part of the cost. It is quite
unrealistic to expect Egypt to
meet the remainder herself,
particularly when regard is had
to her national income and to
the relatively heavy cost of
her expenditure on armaments.
Can Russia be relied upon
to provide further assistance?”

Joseph Alsop in New York
“Herald Tribune ” : “The whole
[Middle East] pattern suggests
that the big Aswan Dam loan is
in fact a reward to Nasser for
approving an important sphere
of Soviet influence in the
Middle East, where he has
always bitterly resisted all in-
fluences but his own. Iraq now
and the Persian Gulf sheikdoms
in the future (the same region
that Molotov asked Hitler to
concede to the Kremlin in
1941) would appear to be
included in the approved Soviet
sphere.”

analysis of the likely
results of the Democratic vic-
tory in the U.S. elections:
“The next Congress is likely
to be more internationally
minded and more favorably
disposed to Federal spending,
both for foreign aid and for
domestic projects. It will be
more sympathetic to proposals
of a Welfare State type, and
will avoid measures which
would alienate the unions.
“It may be prone to probe
and investigate private enter-
prise along the lines already
established by Senator
Kefauver, and there may be at
least a strong minority in favor
of more Government control,
although the word ‘Socialism’
will still be avoided except as
a term of abuse.

U.K. Inflation?
T ondon “Time and Tide”
comment on the end of
hire-purchase restrictions in
Britain:
“Everybody can now buy a
motor-car whether he can
afford one or not. The Left-
wing newspapers cry unemploy-
ment and demand that all
brakes should be instantly
taken off the economy. Hardly
anyone writing or speaking
in public now seems in the
least concerned about inflation,
and yet there is no reason to
suppose that inflation has been
in any real sense stopped. It
was briefly checked, in the
teeth of bitter opposition, last
winter and is now disguised
by the fall in world prices. But
the virus is still there and may
turn into a fever again at any
moment.
“It is probably true that
extra domestic spending need
not have an inflationary effect.
Tax-cuts might militate against,
rather than promote, inflation ;
and they are very desirable
socially. There are two pri-
mary causes of inflation:
high Government spending and
wage-rises unmatched by rising
production. Both these causes
are apparently being allowed
to operate fully again.
“Government spending is to
be deliberately increased, and
increased for its own sake and
to bolster dying industries
rather than as a step towards
higher productivity. Domestic
spending as such may not be
inflationary, but when families
commit themselves to an
extensive programme of hire-
purchase payments, the
pressure for more wages with
which to meet them inevitably
increases.
“The wag e-c 1 a i m s arc
already coming in with their
usual regularity and being
granted hardly less readily.
The Government cannot expect
private employers to stand
firm when it has been made
quite obvious that they can
expect no real political back-
ing.
“Lord Chandos and Mr.
W. J. Carron, two of the mdst
responsible spokesmen respec-
tively of management and
labor, are agreed in talking
approvingly of a fixed 2} per
cent. annual wage-increase
with further increments for
increased production and
adjustments to meet any rise
in the cost of living. As this
2y per cent is specifically not
meant to match increases in
production or the fall in the
value of money, it seems to be
a scheme for building a
permanent rate of inflation into
the economy: a terrifying
prospect for the unorganised
parts of the community, which
have no great industries or
unions to protect them.”
M. Spaok, Secretary-General
of Nato : “Recent history has
shown only too clearly that the
systematic appeasement of
dictators leads to the most
painful experiences. Such a
lesson must not be lost. We
must therefore pursue our
military effort, for although
it imposes a heavy costly
burden on us, it is essential, not
as a means of intimidation but
as a guarantee against threats
and blackmail.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
West New Guinea
Why does the Australian
press appear to give a kind of
passive, or implied, support to
Indonesia’s illogical claim to
West N.G.? Why do we
repeatedly see reference to
“West Irian”? A recent press-
report, like so many others,
describes the usual rambling
diatribe, this time from Soe-
karno, couched in half-
threatening, half - wheedling
terms, and protesting that,
after all, Indonesia is only
asking for its own.
Why isn’t a direct denial of
this rubbish published with
each such report? The danger
is this: public opinion, despite
years of “conditioning,” still
remains a force ; if the public
is conditioned by reading only
Soekarno’s side of the argu-
ment all the time, then it will
not react as it should if Indo-
nesia makes a grab. The con-
ditioning will halt the natural
healthy reaction of anger and
substitute a sort of hesitant
process—“ Well, now, this place
really belongs to them, doesn’t
it?”
It cannot be too strongly
stated that Indonesia has as
much right to claim West N.G.
as it would have to claim Rott-
nest. This part (or any part) of
West N.G,,, is in no way—
anthropologically, culturally or
politically linked to the
former islands of the Dutch
Indies. It just happened to be
taken over by the Dutch
because it was handy. We are
justified in helping them to
keep it, and in taking it over
from them if that is what they
want.
Our right to do these things
is every bit as justifiable as
the “right” of Indonesia to try
to seize it under a false cloak
of. nationalism.
It is high time we discarded
this idiotic “guilt-complex”
and woke-up to the confidence-
trick that is being put over us.
Don't people stop and ask
themselves how we came to be
here ourselves? Do they pro-
pose to give Australia back to
the abos.? The question is as
fundamental as that. This neo-
nationalism has, by clever
propaganda all over the world,
forced the English-speaking
races to accept the position of
wicked colonialists, who must
at once part-up with their ill-
gotten gains. The truth, of
course, is that they are intent
on grabbing our assets as fast
as we’re silly enough to let
them.—R. D. N. (W.A.).
Farmers and Grizzlers
Why do so few members of
the Country party attend
meetings and forward resolu-
tions to headquarters (B.
22/10/’58)? From my obser-
vations as a country bank-
manager, I’d say that a social
complex is largely responsible.
Families living in the same
district are often poles apart
because of wealth, background,
occupations, and even religious
and educational background.
Jealously often exists between
close neighbors. They need to
be hurt badly before they
present a united front on
matters affecting their welfare.
—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
Nuclear Tests
One often wonders what the
Western leaders are aiming at
in their relations with the
Russian bloc. On November 2,
at the Geneva conference,
Britain and the United States
rejected a proposal by Russia
to ban nuclear tests perman-
ently. The Russian plan in-
cluded the setting-up of an
international control-system
for the detection of nuclear
explosions. The West said it
would agree to a suspension of
tests on a year-by-year basis,
but the Russians insisted on a
permanent ban or none.
Perhaps the Soviet attitude
was mere cussedness. But why
would not the West agree to
the Russian proposal? Do the
Western leaders fear that if
at some future date Russia
breaks the agreement by
beginning testing again, they
would be too lily-livered to
declare the ban at an end
because public opinion might
by then be a little stronger?
In any case, why should a
ban on a year-by-year basis be
any more acceptable to the
West than a permanent one?
We are intended to regard the
year-by-year idea as one which
gives a chance to end the agree-
ment at the end of a year “if
something happens.” If
Russia kept the agreement the
West would do best to con-
tinue supporting the ban. And
if the Russians broke it, the
agreement would be at an end
anyway. Does the West think
that Russia has some way of
putting them on a spot if they
agree to a permanent ban?
The West is apparently
ahead of Russia in nuclear
know-how, and it is almost
certainly Russia that stands to
gain by a continuation of the
tests. A provision to allow
nuclear tests only for peaceful
purposes is worth considering.
And a provision for a review
of the agreement if another
nation—such as France or
China began nuclear tests
would probably be necessary.
Of course, the banning of
nuclear tests is but a small step
in the direction of true peace.
And no doubt Russia would by
some means keep the ban from
being put into effect. But that

is beside the point. The West's

offered year-by-year suspen-

Baldir (N.S.W.).
Give Craig a Go!
Why don’t these cricket
“experts” get off lan Craig’s
back, and give him a chance
to re-establish himself as
“another Bradman,” as they
rushed to call him after his 213
not-out against South Africa
four or five years ago? Prac-
tically on the strength of that
one innings (though he had
made several scores in Shield-
cricket the previous season)
they yelled that he “must” go
into the Australian team to
tour England at the end of
that season.
After his “duck” in the
N.S.W.-M.C.C. game recently,
one Sunday paper pictured him
walking back to the pavilion
dragging his bat disappointedly.
What did they expect him to be
doing? Jumping with joy,
when he could already see
Sunday’s headlines? —CRAIG
A DUCK: CRAIG FAILS
AGAIN.
Another expert had him with
head down almost slinking
back to the stand to the
murmurs of “He’s gone for
ever,” “That’s the end of
Craig.” One almost felt like
raising one’s hat out of respect
for a hero passed on.
At least Craig got out
attempting a scoring stroke —
which is more than a lot would
have been game to try against
Lock, who was right on top
at the time.
The whole battery of “ex-
perts” away up in the press-
box were shocked at Craig's
declaration at the tea adjourn-
ment and, according to
several, depriving O’Neill of
another century against the
Englishmen. Let’s assume that
O’Neill would have reached
his century, but who’s to say
that he wouldn't have been
out right after the resumption?
That’s happened before today
to batsmen equal to O’Neill.
Anyway, with the dreary
scoring, particularly by Burke,
on the first day, Craig couldn’t
have delayed the closure any
longer, if there was to be any
chance of a result ; and the
subsequent M.C.C. first-innings
collapse fully justified Craig's
decision.
One well-known writer said :
“What would have happened
30 years ago, had a captain
closed a youthful Bradman
innings at such a stage?”
O’Neill is certainly right on
top at present and let’s hope
he stays there, but had Brad-
man been at the wickets for
208 minutes, as O'Neill was, his
score would by then have been
more like 184 than O'Neill’s 84.
The closure might have shocked
the “experts,” but on all sides
down among the paying
customers Craig was con-
gratulated. They thought it a
good idea, as it meant only
one break, for tea, and there-
fore 10 minutes' extra play.
And the paying customers
surely merit some considera-
tion.
The choicest comment of all
was by the same writer.
“No respect for the new ball,”
he said, fulminating against the
way the N.S.W. players had
apparently plotted together to
knock the sheen off the new
ball to help the spinners, by
throwing the ball onto the
ground four times on the way
out to the wicket. Tut-tut, this
was never done when we played
the game: the ball was nursed
all the way until it was handed
to the bowler.
If this suggestion is true, then
the umpires started it off by
dropping the ball onto the
horrible velvety grass, then
Craig kept the ball rolling by
throwing it wide so that Phil-
pott could not reach it, then
'keeper Ford added his little
piece by throwing it back to
nobody in particular. Imagine
by now the ball is almost use-
less for the fast attack, so
why did Craig make another
mistake by opening with the
quickies? Of course he was not
to know that one over each
from Davidson and Rorke
would serve the purpose far
better than dropping the pill on
the grass.
Anyway, the plot must have
been successful, for after Rorke
got rid of one opener Craig
made a quick double-change
and brought the slowies suc-
cessfully into the attack ; but
he didn't get any credit for
this.
Like many prominent
cricketers in the past, Craig is
having a run of “outs.” As his
announced withdrawal from
Test calculations shows, he is
far from fully recovered from
hepatitis. As was said in B.
19/11/ ’5B, Craig has made
plenty of runs before and he'll
make them again. In form he's
still one of the best stroke-
players in Australia if he
doesn’t have to carry the press-
box on his back. —C. MacD.

ORANGE FIELD DAY
'T'he site of the 7th Annual
Orange Field Day was
C. W. Bradley’s property, Jin-
dalee, near Borenore (N.S.W.).
In 1951 Bradley, a soldier-
settler, took-over 650 acres,
with only one subdivision-
fence, areas of grave soil-
erosion, no dams and no
natural paddocks. By good
management, and helped by
good seasons, he has now 14
paddocks, four stock-watering
dams (and several soil-saving
ones), three grain-silos and a
silage-pit, as well as the con-
served hay used each year. His
pastures now carry 1450 sheep
and 25 head of cattle, compared
with the 400 sheep and one
milking-cow of 1951.
Bradley assessed the main
factor in development as being
the control of erosion. The
principal cause of the erosion
on the property was heavy
run-off from disused gravel-
pits ; it had resulted in the
formation of gullies, sometimes
12ft. deep, and had cut
through valuable land, making

Thinking it out, Bradley
decided that the most important

thing was to subdivide so as
to allow pasture-improvement
and rotational grazing. This
also enabled him to get rid
of the rabbits, carry-out
contour-cultivation, plant trees
and give a topdressing of super.
Good management, like this,
is the key to such a problem.
For the first six years, he
set about establishing improved
pastures on the more readily
accessible parts of his pro-
perty.
It has not been necessary to
cultivate on the contour except
on the steeper slopes. But
with erosion of such propor-
tions as existed on Jindalee, use
had to be made of the most
stringent mechanical means of
controlling run-off. Bradley
built absorption-banks, diver-
sion - banks and soil - saving
dams, and ripped some areas
extensively to increase absorp-
tion. Sometimes he filled
gullies to prevent danger to
stock or to give access to areas
for topdressing.
The hillside to the east of the
field-day site is an interesting
example. It was treated in
November, 1955. Originally,
the gravel-pit on top of the
hill had caused deep gullies
down the slope, because of its
excessive run-off, and the
watercourse to the. north of
the gravel-pit had gullies 10ft.
deep. Bradley stabilised the
area by building absorption-
banks and soil-saving dams and
by contour-ripping. He
fenced it off, sowed pasture-
species and made use of it for
grazing large numbers of stock
for two or three days at a
time. The Soil Conservation
Services, using its own plant
and working under its advances
scheme, has helped on another
hillside by constructing soil-
saving dams, a diversion-bank
and a “dribble-pipe baulk,”
which is new to the district,
This progressive property
made an ideal setting for the
field-day which has become an
annual tradition at Orange.
Organised by the Orange
branch of the Graziers’ Asso-
ciation of N.S.W. and Orange
farm-machinery agents, it aims
at giving manufacturers of
farm-machinery and farm-
equipment an opportunity to
show, in demonstration or by
static exhibition, the capabilites
of their products.
It also gives an opportunity
for primary producers to see
a comprehensive range of
farm-machinery at work and to
compare the jobs done by each
type and make.
It has attracted the atten-
tion of farmers and graziers to
such an extent that this year,
over the three days, about
20,000 attended, representing
all States of the Common-
wealth. There was also an
official delegation from a
university in Saskatchewan
(Canada).
The area occupied by this
year’s static display was more
concentrated than last year’s,
The total size of the demon-
stration-area was about 230
acres ; the smaller display-area
tended to keep exhibits in more
practicable and manageable
proportions, enabled smaller
firms to compete more evenly
with the bigger ones, and made
the whole display more con-
densed and businesslike.
This change was caused by
pure economics—the high cost
of staging a large number of
exhibits at the field-day,
Naturally, it did not meet with
universal approval; some
observers compared this year's
show unfavorably with pre-
vious years’, feeling that, per-
haps, the display-blocks were

on such a matter are bound
to vary, and the unbiased spec-
tator could not deny that the
committee's aim was achieved,
even if the spectacle was not
quite so imposing.
Several items were intro-
duced for the first time this
year; notably, a demonstration
of bulk-loading super, from
railhead to aircraft for top-
dressing ; also some items of
specific interest to women, such
as cookery-demonstrations and
lectures on interior-decorating
and even beauty-care.
But the most valuable inno-
vations were on the adminis-
trative side. The establishment
°f an “operations-room” to
control operations throughout
the area, and the introduction
of mobile radio-telephone links
between this ops.-room and the
various demonstration - sites
made for increased flexibility.
The handling of the radio-
telephones by operators of
Pye Radio was admirable.

Most of Queensland should receive good general rains
m December, although rainfall may be patchy in part of the
far-west area, which can expect little relief until February.
The heaviest falls are indicated in the southern half of the
State during December, with likelihood of flooding.
Good general rains may be expected in N.S.W. during
December, the best falls probably occurring on the North
Coast and over the northern tablelands and north-west
areas. Rainfall may be patchy in January, with heavy falls
in February.
Victoria should receive general rains during December,
and rains will probably continue in the southern half of the
State during January, with some flooding. Heavy general
rains are indicated in February.
There should be good general rains throughout South
Australia during December. Moderate rain is likely in the
agricultural areas during January, although poor elsewhere
in the State.
In Western Australia, the Kimberleys should receive

development of great import-
ance, both for the primary-
producer and the manufacturer.
H. H. Jackson, chairman of
the committee, gave further
details of this competition, of
which the conditions are being
worked-out by the committee
in collaboration with officers
of the Department of Primary
Industry and the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture.
For reasons of
time and conveni-
ence, Mr. Jackson
said, the item
selected for competi-
tion would be ham-
mermills. National
farm - machinery
competitions of this
nature have been
conducted in other
countries, notably in
England, where they
are sponsored by the
Royal Agricultural
Society. However, as
far as is known,
hammermills have
never before been
the subject of such
a competition. Since
hammermills are an
important develop-
ment of the live-
stock - industry and
destined to be a
permament feature
of Australian agri-
culture, he added, it would be
significant and gratifying if
Australia could provide the
first break-through in this par-
ticular field. Looking further
ahead, he hoped that this com-
petition would be a' v step
towards establishing a national
machine-testing station.

Grazcos trailer firefighting-
unit ; it can be worked behind

lightness to supplement its effi-
ciency.
Taken all in all, the exhibits
were of high standard. Here
and there one might note an
excellent idea which had gone
off at half-cock because of
lack of practical knowledge in
its application. But such
instances were rare. Once
again (like last year) there was
one power-saw not protected
by a guard-fence, which might
have been a source of danger
to spectators.
This observer’s general im-
pression was that there was
too much detail to be absorbed
in a limited time by even the
most avid inspector of static
exhibits. As a corollary to
this, there might have been
more feature-demonstrations
catering for seasonal demand.
A farmer visiting the field-day,
particularly in these times of a
buyer’s market, knows what
particular pieces of machinery
he wants, goes to those dealers
who keep such items, chooses
the kind he prefers, and then
might welcome the opportunity
to look at demonstrations of
machines in action, rather than
wander round static exhibits.
Of course, there’s the other
side to this argument. The
field-day is organised to help
the manufacturers of farm-
machinery do business, as well
as helping farmers to select
their specific requirements.
Considering the high cost of
staging exhibits at the field-
day, manufacturers should
therefore be encouraged to
bring as many exhibits as they
can, in the hope that more
business will be done. They
know well, by now, that a good
machine has nothing to fear
at this field-day.
The trend towards concen-
tration this year seemed defin-
itely a step in the right direc-
tion. There were several
examples of active post-
mortems on stock and also
some film-shows that created
general interest. But these
might be added to by more
central demonstrations. Ex-
hibitors might also give more
thought to animating their dis-
plays in a similar way.
There was one aspect not
covered by the organisation
of the field-day which might
be worth consideration for the
future. Although the women-
folk are now catered for in the
excellent and well-attended
demonstrations and lectures on
subjects of special interest to
them, there is nothing for the
children.
The field-day, of course, is
run primarily for farmers, not
for children, but the youngsters
will be there whatever
happens, and it would make it
easier for parents and happier
for the kids if something was
laid-on for their amusement.
Nothing elaborate would be
needed, either a few swings
and seesaws; perhaps some
pony-rides. Another welcome
visitor might be an ice-cream
man, who need not compete
against the takings in the
Legacy refreshment-tent; but
who would add to the pleasure
the kids get from the show.
Another point that occurred
to many spectators was the

Selling Dairy Produce
‘'Windy”: There’s a big
potential of untapped markets
for dairy-products waiting here
in Australia — and with the
price of butter and cheese
wavering in England and
Europe the more sold here the
better. And on this we can
learn a lot from America.
In the U.S., for example, you
can buy butter in large or
small blocks to suit any family.
If the woman of the house is
putting on a “do” she can get
butter in fancy rolls or any
design she wants.
That’s what puts the skids
under the sale of substitutes.
The public get the best in the
way they like it best.
On top of that, the butter is
wrapped in gay, attractive
prints, unlike most of the
butter-prints in this country,
which have not changed for
the last 30 years. Even the
selling-points on our prints
went out with the Ark: who
wants to know that the com-
pany won a medal at the
London Exhibition in 1915?
In America you can buy
milk in bottles or cartons, in
large or small quantities, plain
or flavored, natural for drink-
ing, or skimmed for cooking
and for those who prefer a
fatless milk to drink. The
children there drink more milk
than the combined age-groups
in this country! And kids are
no different the whole world
over. One need only see how
ice-cream sells in its different
farms to know what could be
done with milk.
Apart from a few favored
areas, you find it difficult to
buy a bottle of cream in smaller
Australian towns or country
centres —the very places where
people would relish it. The
Americans have proved that
two types of cream, at least, are
worth marketing. One is high-
testing cream, about 42 per
cent, fat, called whipped-cream.
The other is a reduced cream,
with not more than 25 per cent,
fat in it —the sort that goes
well with apple-pie. Several
factories here are toying with
the idea of putting these
creams on the market. Why
delay? The market’s there.
Grab it with both hands, and
there will be less to sell on the
lower overseas markets.
The cheese-men have really
got this selling idea: new
varieties on the market, new

parts of Australia have dis-
covered—in particular when

type, perhaps, outside the
main run of your experience.

tween knowing and guessing.

methods of packaging and
presenting cheese to the public.
Other forms of dairy-produce
will have to follow suit.
The biggest trouble in
marketing dairy-produce today
is that those at the head of
affairs still think in terms of
butterfat. What’s wrong with
drying skim-milk and selling it
flavored to make drinks? Yet
most of the skim-milk in Aus-
tralia is used to feed animals
like pigs and calves, which grow
just as well on other foods that
cannot be eaten by the human
race. In countries overseas a
farmer would be taken to task
for . feeding such valuable
human food to animals.
The truth is that Australia,
once a traditional butter coun-
try, is in the throes of a revo-
lution. The butter-factory,
once the bulwark of the district,
is now secondary to milk and
milk-products. It will mean
the disappearance of many of
the small butter-factories, which
will be converted to milk or
dried milk-powder. You can’t
halt progress.
A vigorous sales-promotion
campaign is the only way to
sell dairy-produce.
Broiler Poultry
“Spin”: Before Australian
.poultryfarmers can reap full
benefit from the broiler market
there’s got to be an end to the
practice (all too prevalent) of
sending hens to market as soon
as they show signs of ailing.
This policy of saving some-
thing from dying stock can’t
be too heavily condemned, and
it’s done more harm to the
broiler market than scarcity or
high prices could ever do.
There’ll always be a few
members of any industry with
no scruples about sacri-
ficing their mates’ livelihood
for the sake of gaining a few
pennies for themselves. That
type is being disciplined under
the present egg-marketing regu-
lations, and they’d soon fall
into line under similar rules
governing the marketing of
broilers.
Aren’t there health- and
meat - inspectors doing that
now? Well, they’re trying to
—and doing as good a job as
they can in the circumstances.
But the fact that fowls are
condemned in the markets as
unfit for human consumption
suggests that a lot more are
getting through which may be
fit, but certainly aren’t desir-
able or palatable. Those are
the ones doing the damage.
Canipaspe Project
It is natural that the secretary
of the Eppalock Advance-
ment League should defend
the Eppalock project (B.
22/10/’5B), but I can’t allow
him to describe my article as
inaccurate and misleading
without instancing how or why.
In brief I stated—and re-
affirm—that the part of the
Campaspe watershed which I
visited is a downright disgrace,
and I offered in detail a simple
recipe, the Pittman-Keyline
technique, for establishing
pasture and increasing the
carrying-capacity fourfold at
small expense. I finished by
questioning whether, if this
were done, a dam at Eppalock
would be necessary or feasible.
If there are in fact 710
square-miles of this sort of
-country, and if the rainfall is
actually higher than I was
given to understand, then all
the more reason for getting
this country sown-down and
producing properly as quickly
as possible.
If after this has been done
it is held to be desirable or
necessary to build a weir at
Eppalock or anywhere else,
then let us by all means do
so. It is simply a case of first
things first.
I believe that a sum, less
than the cost of an Eppalock
weir, applied by way of a loan
to the landholders of the
watershed for- the specific
purpose of establishing Key-
lined pasture over the whole
watershed area would produce
far greater production, and
more speedily, than that likely
to be achieved by damming
the run-off and irrigating the
already good country below
Goornong.
This increased production
would be achieved, moreover,
at no cost to the community
and at a handsome profit to the
landholders of the watershed.

many acres of swamp on my
Queensland dairyfarm, all
covered by distichum. It goes
to sleep at the beginning of
winter and shows not a vestige
of leaf or shoot anywhere. It
is ready to awaken again
towards the end of September ;
but, no matter how much
water there is in the swamps,
it won’t come to life until the
gullies run after a fresh or
there’s a good fall of rain.
Then, the next morning, the
water is covered by a green
carpet of water-couch! Its
depth-limit seems to be about
4ft., but so long as the water
is fresh and reasonably warm
there’s no limit to its rapid
growth.
“Myall” calls it a good stock-
feed. I’ll say it is! I don’t
know how many cows to an
acre could be stocked on it.
Cows and horses aren’t the
only ones that appreciate it,
either; many kinds of water-
bird use it for nest-building,
and no doubt find some food
in it.
The heavier it’s stocked, the
more it spreads—cows carry
runners in the mud of their
hoofs. But one thing it is.
certainly not —a weed in culti-
vation. Its virtues outweigh
its vices a hundred times.
Within reason, good cultiva-
tion can control any weed ;
distichum doesn’t rank with
prickly-pear and noxious things
like that. Once it has got
control of a swamp, I doubt
whether any farmer could get
rid of it—and who would want
to do away with it in what
would otherwise be waste
areas?

Method of preserving ginger ?
First, make sure you get the right
sort of ginger, and not the type
used in gardens as ornamental
plants*—these gingers are Hedy-
chiutns and can’t: be eaten. Wash
and scrape the ginger-roots, cut
info pieces of suitable size, arid
make a syrup of lib. sugar to 1
quart water. Boil the ginger in
this gently until it is soft enough
to be pierced with a knitting-needle.
Dram on a sieve or similar con-
tainer, and when all syrup has
dripped off roll' the ginger in good
white sugar and dry slowly in the
oven with the door open. Roll in
sugar again, and store in a very
cool place in screw-top jars,

Brief information on. the Austra-
lian Legion of Ex-Servicemen atul
Women ?
Formed on April 25, 1944, it was
primarily designed as an association
lor those who served in World War
11 in the armed services or in the
merchant-navy without qualifying
as returned soldiers. Any man or
woman who has served in the naval,
military or air forces or in the
merchant-navy is eligible for mem-
bership. It has branches in most
States of Australia, and its attitude
towards ex-service problems, and
legislation affecting ex,-servicemen,
is on the whole the same as that
of the R.S.S.A.I.L.A. It has formed
a co-operative housing sbeiety and
conducts a welfare service for the
guidance of members. Like the
R.5.5.A.1.L.A., it bases its activities
upon a series of sub-branches in
metropolitan and country areas.

A method of repairings old maps?
Age-worn and mutilated maps and
charts should be flattened-out by
placing between strawboards and
subjecting them to heavy weight.
Repairs can then be made; paper
resembling the color and texture
of the original should be used to
repair rents and holes. The maps
should be pasted and mounted on
cotton stretched tight to remove
wrinkles. Any tendency to wrinkle
or crease because of the dampness
caused by pasting can be reduced
by placing a sheet of manilla paper
on the map and rubbing it down
into the cotton with the palm of
the hand. Paste is prepared accord-
ing to the quality of the paper —
a map on thin paper requires a
thinner paste than does one on
heavy paper. When it is dry—say,
overnight—the map should again be
put between- strawboards and left
for about two or three weeks. Then
the edges should be trimmed and
a narrow cotton border added to
prevent fraying in handling.

Information on tlte Law of
Ancient Lights ?
In England a landowner who had
been receiving light through a par-
ticular window for a period of 20
years,, or formerly for a Long time,
was entitled to retain that light
against anyone who w'ished to build
so as to obscure it. The right was
to light, not to view, and was- of
considerable importance in older
times wheri natural light was valu-
able and artificial light of very poor
quality indeed. It would not be
safe to assume that the law is totally
dead in Australia, although two
things combine to eliminate the need
for its application. One is local-
government legislation and ordin-
ances, which for the most part
require a certain distance between
buildings (as against older times in
England when buildings were built
touching each other and frequently
with common walls- and beams); the
other is the Torrens system of land-
holding, which prevents rights being
acquired in relation to property
merely by length of time.

“The subject-matter is a scene at
the mining-field of Rock Vale, New
England, about 1897. My people
kept the hotel, and my mother was
known far and wide for feeding
the magpies, dozens of them, all the
year round at sunrise. Years later,
after the Ist World War, she was
honored with the 0.8. E., I think
the only such honor given to a
retail liquor-trader in Australia. She
was at this time in the hotel-
business at Tam worth, with no mag-
pies to feed at dawn —but many
soldiers to feed at all times.” Well,
here’s a bit of the verse, then : —-
Do the carols bring the memories of
the folk-names of the past,
The Scanlons, Lyons and Finnigans, the
Brackens and the Bells,
The mate-names of the miners, hard of

Looking for something different in
Christmas gifts? Tired of the old hand-
kerchief-and-scent routine? Why not try
a cluster of the new plastic artificial
flowers, carnations, roses, daffodils,
anemones, shasta-daisies, etc.? They look
so delicate and real, but have a texture
of their own that is delightful. The
Italian ones are the best (and by far the
most expensive), but the French are quite
comparable in appearance and about half
the price. Cheaper ones still come from
Hong Kong (quite good) and Japan, but
it is the exquisite quality of the better
ones that makes them so charming.
Then why not give a little bit of mink
for a present? You can buy a collar in
brown Eastern mink edged with golden
bubble-beads, very glamorous, for £7 75.,
and cuffs to match for the same price,
which is admittedly very little for mink.
For the youngsters (of all ages) there
are the new mechanical toys—monkeys
that blow soap-bubbles with a pipe from
a bowl, bears that pour themselves out
drinks, comical animals that play a one-
man-band or a xylophone. Their eyes
light-up as they go into action, and they
really put life into their work. They are
about £3 and well worth it as entertain-
ment-pieces.
Other novelties are long-handled
pepper-and-salt shakers for barbecues ;
piggy-banks made of china, with pretty
flowers decorating their backs ; and
figurines of the goddess Kwan Min which
range in price from ss. to £2. In the
larger types the hand is separate and
can be inset palm upwards (for happi-
ness) or reversed (for sorrow) according
to the owner’s mood.
TV-slippers, with a leather sole and a
knitted top, can be bought in dozens of
designs. They should be something
different for Gran. She generally has a
TV these days, and she needs slippers—
and, besides, she’s tired of handkerchiefs
and chocolates. For Grandpa you can
get a couple of brandy-glasses in a box
for 235. 6d. This might lead you into
buying him a bottle of brandy also, of
course.
However, a teetotal grandpa might
prefer something with a vintage-car
motif. This is a favorite design this
season, and appears on practically every-
thing. There are also some engaging
tigers (toy ones) on the market this year.
They look very decorative and can be
put to many uses. A couple sitting in
the back of the parked car, for instance,
may well discourage car-thieves. Unless,
of course, they encourage tiger-thieves.
If you want something small you can
choose a pocket ashtray for. 17s. lid. It
is-a little enamelled box, and can also be
used for making people think you are
a mysterious character. Then, again, if
you want something large you can buy
a simply beautiful folding-screen of four
panels 7ft. high. It is made in Chinese-
red, black and white with a fine-drawn
design by Italian Fornasetti. It is £3OO.
This is probably an appropriate point
at which to stop. ~

A little girl, five years old, who had
been unable to utter a sound 18 months
ago, answered questions, named objects
and “bought” -goods at a shop during a
demonstration given at the Deaf and
Blind Children’s Institution annual meet-
ing on Wednesday, and it was most
touching to see the beam on the tiny face
when she had shown what she could do.
The Governor, Sir Eric Woodward, and
Lady Woodward attended the meeting,
at which the chairman of directors, Mr.
H. A. Curl, presided.
Mr. Owen Jones, Director of Primary
Education, suggested that the institution’s
deficit for the year was not entirely to be
regretted, and amusingly gave the
example of a committee for which he
personally worked. It did not have a
deficit, and when it applied for Govern-'
ment aid it received the reply that
obviously it did not need any!
Mr. Curl particularly thanked for their
work for the institution Sir Leighton
Bracegirdle, Mr. F. W. Sutton, Mrs. W. J.
Smith, Mr. Hal Lashwood and Mr. Terry
Campbell. Mrs. D. H. Harries and Mrs.

The Royal Ballet continues to attract
large audiences to Her Majesty's, and on
the opening night of the second pro-
gramme Rowena Jackson and Philip
Chatfield received an ovation for their
pas de deux from “Don Quixote.”
Several smart ensembles caught the eye.
Lady Tait wore an attractive short sheath-
frock of black velvet, which she high-
lighted with a white Arctic-fox stole.
Black velvet also fashioned the full-
skirted frock Mrs. L. R. Buxton wore ;
flounces of black faille were an unusual
touch on the skirt, as was the apricot-
tinted fox-boa which completed her
ensemble. Her daughter, Mrs. John
Teague, also chose a black frock. With
Mrs. Eric Walquist was Mrs. Dermot
Connelly. Mr. and Mrs. Jim Campbell
and Mr. and Mrs. Peter Condon were
also in the audience.

In 1957 Rev. Brother P. G. O’Neill
founded the St. Paul’s Nursery for Blind
Babies. Bro. O’Neill, who became totally
blind in 1927, has devoted his life ever
since to the care of the blind, and was
mainly responsible for the opening of the
Villa Maria Hostel for the Blind in 1938
and the Villa Madonna 10 years later.
St. Paul’s Nursery takes children at three
years of age to receive their elementary
training. They board at St. Paul’s from
Monday to Friday, then return home for
the weekend to enable them to retain
their family contacts. St. Paul’s is very
much “in the red,” for the average main-
tenance loss each week is over £2OO. To
aid the hostel a group of energetic women
have banded together to organise a con-
cert, which will be held on Sunday,
November 30, at 2.30 p.m., at the Olym-
pic Swimming Pool. Lady Connelly is
chairman ; Mrs. Leo Curtis is handling
the publicity and is vice-chairman.
Rowena Jackson and Philip Chatfield, of
the Royal Ballet, will appear, as will
singer Pat O’Hagan and other well-known
entertainers. Ann Curtis, Sue Spring,
Mrs. Peter Metzner and Mrs. John
DeZoets are the ticket-secretaries. Dona-
tions are £l, 10s. and ss.

The Toorak Presbyterian Church was
decorated with gold and white flowers
for the marriage of Susan, only daughter
of Judge and Mrs. Norman Mitchell, of
Croydon, with Donald Gardner Stott.
Venetian-lace and pearls embroidered the
V-neckline of the bride's long-sleeved
magnolia-satin gown. There was intricate
pleating on the skirt and long train. The
long tulle veil was held with an orange-
blossom coronet, and she carried long-
stemmed cream roses. The bride’s
cousin, Susan Falkiner, with Sheena
Cumming and Lynette Murray-Moore,
’maided ; they wore full-length frocks of
French-embroidered organza, and they
carried bouquets of gold roses. The
bridegroom, youngest son of the late
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Stott, formerly of
Upper Beaconsfield, had Peter de Cres-
pigny as best man. Groomsmen were
John Barrett and David Stott. After
the ceremony, Judge and Mrs. Mitchell
received guests at a reception held at
Dennis House, Glenferrie.
Fifteen-year-old Deanna Day, only
daughter of Mrs. Constance Day, of St.
Kilda, will portray the role of Cousin
Lucy in “The Happiest Millionaire,”
which will have its premiere at the Little
Theatre on Friday next, November 28.
This will be a gala-night in aid of the
Yooralla School for Crippled Children.
Deanna is still at St. Catherine’s school,
and this is her first appearance with the
Little Theatre. She has studied ballet for
the past five years, and is also a student
of drama with Irene Mitchell, and has
appeared as a mannequin for well-known
designer Dorothy Git sham. Deanna’s
winter sport is skiing, and in between
times she collects recordings of classical
music and ballet.
Mrs. R. G. Casey, president of the Aus-
tralian-American Association’s women’s
group, gave a brief, witty account of her
latest travels overseas at the final meet-
ing of the year. An interesting anecdote
was one she had from British Prime
Minister Harold Macmillan, who said to
General de Gaulle: “You know, if I
did not know you were a Frenchman I
would swear you were a Scottish Presby-
terian.” To which the General replied:
“I’m not, but my grandmother was.”
After Mrs. Casey’s talk came the great
surprise. Tucked away in the corner was
a very large parcel wrapped in Christmas
tinsel and tied with scarlet ribbon. It
was a spanking new piano, bought with
some of the proceeds of the Coral Sea
Ball and with money from various groups
in the women's organisation.
Among those who attended were Mrs.
C. McKay, Mrs. Jeffrey Macartney, Mrs.
Tom Coles, Mrs. Mel Saunders, Lady
Tom Blarney, Lady McConnan, Lady
Storey, Mrs. Angus Jones, Mrs. T.
Wallace Mitchell and Mrs. Mark
Clements.
Over 200 women attended the luncheon
and fiesta of leisure-wear held at Giro's
to assist the funds of the Tweddle Baby
Hospital building-fund. President of the
organising commitee Mrs. John Heath-
cote (wearing a lovely frock of cherry-
red-and-white patterned silk with a wide-
brimmed natural straw hat) received the
official guests, who included Lady Angliss,
president of the hospital board of
management.
Committee members present were Mrs.
Edvard Alstergren (whose large white
flower-trimmed straw hat was worn with
a junior-navy linen suit), Mrs. Hedley
Ladd (her choice a natural Honan-silk
pleated frock and a cream powder-puff
tulle hat), Mrs. Don Osborne (in flower-
patterned silk sheath-frock and picture-
hat of natural straw), Mrs. George Shep-

Over sandwiches and iced-coffee at
the Oriental Hotel Mrs. W. Wark, con-
venor of the E.S.U. Fair, outlined some
of the work which has been done to
make this Christmas fair a huge success.
One-hundred women members of the
English Speaking Union have been busy
all through the year making articles to
be sold at the fair on December 6, and
they have issued a challenge to the male
members to raise £lOO before the fair
opens. Gay umbrellas will be set-up on
the lawns of E.S.U. House in Toorak
Road West. Luncheon and afternoon-tea
will be served, and Mrs. Wark and her
committee are confident they will raise
£lOOO from this effort. Also at the infor-
mal luncheon were Mrs. A. S. Jackson
(secretary), Mrs. J. K. Kiddle and Mrs.
W. Banks (who represented the younger
members), Mrs. Charles Buckley and Mrs.
D. G. Henderson (Mt. Eliza branch). On
December 1 at E.S.U. House there will
be an exhibition of flower-arrangements
to help raise funds, and on November
30 the younger members are holding an
Italian supper-party.


contingency has been provided for, to
“throw your bonnet over the mill and
soar from the known to seize the
unknown” —i.e., to do something
brilliant and incalculable at the peak
of a battle—and he goes on:—
In my own limited experience
certain “moments” come to mind —-
at Mareth when we switched the
main thrust line to the western
flank.... in Normandy..when I
advocated a strong thrust on the left
flank of the Allied advance.... .and at
Arnhem.
Also he says:—•
Moses and Cromwell believed
intensively in a divine mission,
which never failed them in battle ;
Napoleon in a human destiny, which
in the end did... .The one great
commander who did not possess this
quality of inner conviction was
Wellington.
So it’s between Moses and Cromwell:
and maybe it is Cromwell who may be
best said to resemble Montgomery,
although he probably wasn’t as sound
a puritan. After the victory in Europe,
for instance, if it had been Cromwell
who had been given the banquet at
Antwerp Town Hall he would prob-
ably have had a better stomach for
the rich food than to be sick on the
floor of the car driving him away . . .
It was this puritanism in Mont-
gomery which, combined with his belief
in his divine mission, made him so
ruthless. His accounts of battles may
be lacking in color, if only because he
generally went to sleep when they
started; but his casual way of remark-
ing that he had to replace some high-
ranking officer, whom he names, is
enough to send shivers down your spine,
and his way of talking, or not talking,
about, for instance, General Auchin-
leck, goes a bit further. Even from his
best friend and most powerful patron.
Churchill, he stood no nonsense in
May, 1944, when Churchill visited him
in Portsmouth before D-day:—
“I understand, sir, that you want
to discuss with my staff the propor-
tion of soldiers to vehicles landing
on the beaches in the first flights. I
cannot allow you to do this... .You
can argue with me, but not with my
staff....If you think it is wrong,
that can only mean that you have
lost confidence in me.”
One can understand, Churchill being
Churchill, that a somewhat awkward
silence followed these remarks.
And when he was Chief of the
Imperial General Staff, Montgomery
couldn’t get on with the Minister for
Defence, A. V. Alexander (now Lord
Alexander of Hillsborough) in the
Labor-party cabinet:—
After a particularly exasperating
conference.... I put it to the First
Sea Lord and the Chief of the Air
Staff that Mr. Alexander was a
“passenger”; I asked them to form
up with me in a combined approach
to the Prime Minister and ask for
his removal, on the plea that we had
no confidence in him. To my
immense astonishment they both
agreed!
Although his accomplices eventually
backed-down, the affair worked-up into
a really big scene, Montgomery, now a
Viscount, threatening to state his side
of the case in the House of Lords. Yet
this same Alexander, in September,
1948, offered Montgomery the chair-
manship of the Western Union
Commanders-in-Chief Committee:—
I often think that A.V. Alexander
“took his coat off” to ensure that I
got the job. I must have been an
awful nuisance to him during my
time as C.I.G.S. Socially—off parade
as it were —we were very good
friends. But in defence matters I
just couldn’t get on with him. It
was probably my fault.... As a
result of it all I was pretty unpopular
when I left Whitehall to become an
international soldier.
Allied to this uncompromising
tendency of a puritan who lives out his
lonely grandeur in a caravan to say
exactly what he thinks, is a further
tendency to be always right; and this
may be found in Montgomery’s
explanation of his complete responsi-
bility for Alamein. for the reorganisa-
tion of plans for the jump into Sicily,
for his further reorientation of British
arrangements for D-day, and for the
bold single thrust he advocated against
the Saar from Normandy which, if it
had been agreed upon, instead of the
spreading thrust which fanned out
across Europe, might have shortened,
he says, the time to German capitula-
tion.
And yet Montgomery cannot avoid
one redeeming vice of puritans, in
which they
Compound for sins they are inclined
to
By damning those they have no
mind to.
Monty, said an Australian general
one won’t embarrass by naming, was
as fond as any man of his little creature-
comforts. Money didn’t interest
him:—
I made it known in September,
1945, that, if offered a monetary
reward, I would not accept it It
would not be good for [the average
ex-serviceman] to read of individual
soldiers, however much he might
admire and respect them, being given,
say, £lOO,OOO or £50,000 in addition
to their pensions when he (the ex- ;
serviceman) was hard put to it to
support his own wife and family.
But it was not quite the same thing
when he became inclined to, in fact,
bought, the old Isington Mill on the
Wey, an outer shell which would have
to be completely worked-over inside to
make it a residence. Then, when his
request for materials and labor was
refused by Regional Headquarters at
Reading, he wrote direct to Aneurin
Bevan, the Minister for Health, asking
him to intervene. Bevan wrote bach
sympathetically, but pointed out that
neither he nor Montgomery would
benefit from the publicity of such a
bypassing of housing-regulations, and
advised waiting until the edge had
been taken off the housing-shortage-
Then Montgomery appealed to the
Prime Minister and got his licence. |
And so Isington Mill was made into
a home in the teeth of a British Labor
Minister’s objections, and with th|
active aid of an Australian Labor Prime
Minister, none less than Chifley, who
saw that Montgomery had as a gift o
the Australian Government flooring of
Tasmanian oak, and stairs, doors and
built-in cupboards of mountain-ash
from Victoria: —
The Australian Government also
gave me the barn in which my war
caravans are housed, except the roof,
which is of cedar shingles given by
the Canadian Government. Australia
and New Zealand, knowing that I
had no furniture for my home, both

The long-dead living forest rose
as white as bone, as dark as hair.
In rage the old protagonists
fought for my life; and I was there.
My kinsman's flesh, my kinsman’s skull
enclosed me, and our wounds were one.
The long-dead forest reeled and sank
before the bitter night was done —
before we struck and tore again
the jumping flesh from out the hide,
and drank the blood that ran and slowed
to show the moment when he died. '

Dreaming of knowledge and of love
in agony he treads his path ;

and yet my nightmare holds us both.
I drink his murder’s choking blood
and he in ignorance sheds my tears.
The centuries bind us each in each —

till from those centuries l wake

within the forests of my heart

Extracts from the Journal of George Allen
edited by G. W. Dundas Allen
George Allen, the first Colonial Attorney and Solicitor to be professionally educated in
N.S.W., arrived in Australia in 1818 at the age of 15. The journal he kept until 1877, now
edited by his great-grandson, has many interesting notes on the turbulent society of his
day and provides an illuminating picture of life in Sydney as it was lived in the family
circle and the field of public affairs. 25/- (post 7d.)

gave me various articles. So while I
had some difficulty in getting the
British Government of the day even
to let me spend some of my own
savings on a home, all my worldly
possessions having been destroyed by
German bombing during the war, the
Dominion Governments did their
best to help me as soon as they heard
of my plight.
Nor, no doubt, did the average
English ex-serviceman begrudge him
this shameless bypassing of the regula-
tions; if you are going to have great
generals you have to put-up with a
type of man who has divine assurance
that what he wants is right, and who
won't be happy till he gets it.
Penguins
A recent batch of Penguins includes
a reprint of 21 of H. G. Wells’s pseudo-
scientific stories.
Wells may be described as the father
of the present vast brood of science-
fiction writers. His account of the
first appearance of the land-ironclad
in warfare could, with a few technical
corrections, be taken for an actual
description of the advent of the tank
on the Western front during World
War I.
When he looks backwards, as in
“The Grisly Folk,” Wells is equally
illuminating. The Grisly Folk are a
race of creatures, the Neanderthalers,
who have developed independently the
faculty of reason but not speech, and
whose heads are set forward like those
of horses. They meet our true ances-
tors in their flight from the primeval
ice-pack to the warm and fertile valley
which is now the Mediterranean. To
our ancestors the Grisly Folk seem
as much a menace to their way of life
as the negro does to the white folk of
Alabama. The Grisly Men have not
yet got out of the habit of eating their
young, so they are not as numerous as
the true men, who love and cherish
theirs.
The Grisly Men’s only weapons are
huge stones which they throw at their
enemies, or with which they bash their
skulls in. The humans have more
refined weapons and a rudimentary
social sense which the Grisly Men
haven’t. A war to the death ensues,
and it is waged all over Europe for
thousands of years.
Wells would have been the most
surprised man in the world if, when he
was writing “The Time Machine” and
“The War of the Worlds,” somebody
had put into his hands a new and topical
Pelican—also in the latest batch for
review— The Exploration of Space, by
Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke is the former
chairman of the Interplanetary Society.
Whereas Wells excitedly penetrates
space with the power of the imagina-
tion. Clarke calmly and drily gives the
mathematics of the business, giving a
clear and non-technical description of
man’s place in the universe and the
possibilities of exploration of the solar
system and of the methods that could
be used to colonise it despite its alien
conditions.
Other Penguins are Madame de
Pompadour, a sprightly and uncom-
monly sympathetic picture of Louis
XV’s mistress, who turns out in this
description to be wiser and more
human than the king and the hordes
of aristocrats who hung around Ver-
sailles while their country was plung-
ing into revolution; Gigi and the Cat,
another Colette; The Drunken Forest,
a fascinating account by Gerald Durrell
of his adventures among snakes in the
Chaco territory of Paraguay; and Poet
and Visionary, a selection of Blake's
poetry, prophetic writings and letters
which helps to strengthen the present
commentators conviction that Blake
was an infinitely better poet than he
was a draughtsman.

Reviewed Briefly
Black Meg’s: /Wilfrid Robertson
(Dent). A somewhat grisly boys’ book,
in which the London student with his
young friend, seeking a quiet place to
study in the country, finds a body in
the shed behind the cottage. Then they
discover a secret cellar, which has a
second exit through a cupboard in the
living-room; loot is cached there, etc.,
etc.; but in hooking-up the further
doings with the dead body the author
is not very ingenious.
* * * *
The Atomisation of Modern Art:
Max Picard (Vision). A finely designed
and covered little essay on how modern
abstract art is wrong in representing
modern disintegrating personality.
Picard is a German existentialist, but
he’s “had” abstraction, and considers
an artist may represent his times as well
by opposing them as by going with
them; that there are too many pictures
that mean nothing; and that pictures
are used as a base on which people
can speak to one another, whereas in
the great days no one spoke about
pictures, but pictures spoke to man.
* * * *
The King Must Die: Mary Renault
(Longmans). The story of Theseus,
from childhood to his escape from
Crete, written on the assumption, not
unsupported by recent diggings in
Crete, that Theseus was an actual hero.
Told in the first-person in that matter-
of-fact, colloquial manner perfected by
Robert Graves for this type of novel,
it keeps fairly close to the standard
versions of the myth, differing only in
details that could not be made circum-
stantially plausible. Its reconstruction
of the surface of daily life in the
Bronze Age is something of a triumph,
since the author, with little more than
archaeological findings to go on, must
have had to guess at a lot of it. Under-
standably. the Cretan episode, for
which there is most evidence, takes up
nearly half the book.
