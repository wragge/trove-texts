Compare the Stewart Patent Magnetic Speedometer
with any other type made. A thorough inspection will
disclose a vast difference in construction and operation.
Ask the Salesman to sound a Stewart Motor-driven
Warning Signal alongside any other electric signal made
—the Stewart will speak up in a most convincing manner.
When you are offered an Auto Guard, ask the Salesman
to stand on it—-spring it up and down as vigorously as
he likes. If it is a Stewart it will retain its original shape
and position. Stewart Guards are made of extra high-
quality spring steel —they are Auto Guards in every
sense of the word.
If you want a spot light, or a trouble lamp, most any lamp
will do, but if you want a Searchlight for night driving,
which will throw an intense beam of light 1 000 ft. ahead,
then the Stewart takes the lead.
As to Feed Systems—the fact that 88 per cent, of the
world’s car manufacturers are now using Stewart
Vacuum Systems as standard equipment speaks volumes.

THE V ULNERABLE SPOT in power transmission is
frequently in the belting- used. Intermittent loads,
unusual temperatures or conditions of service, cause the
belting on the pulleys to relax or become flaccid, with
consequent leakage of power.
MANGROVITE BELTING has no Vulnerable Spot.
It is tanned by the special Mangrovite process, that imparts
an elasticity and flexibility to every inch. It maintains
its tenacious grip even under the most adverse conditions.

The Biology of War
Romain Holland writes of G. F. Nicolai
as perhaps the greatest European of his
generation. He was Professor of Physiology
at the Berlin University and physician to
the household of the ex-Ivaiser when war
broke out. One of the few great men in
Germany who refused to share the war mad-
ness which seized and annihilated millions
of. his countrymen, he not only, infused
participate 'in it, but had' the daring
resist it. In October, 1014, 00 German into
lectuals published a manifesto defending f
cause of Imperial Germany and proclaimii
the war as one of German Kultur against
world of barbarism. Nicolai had the hare
hood to write a manifesto in reply entitle
“An Appeal to Europeans.” It is iuteres
ing in these days to record that one of tl
other two distinguished professors at tl
great University who signed the eounte
manifesto was Einstein, the discoverer o:
Relativity. The document was, of emirs
suppressed, and, a few months later, Nicola
threw to the winds, for the sake of trut
his career, his salary, his friends and h
comfort by incorporating it in a series o:
lectures on the war. He whs npprehendec
by the Junkers and put into Graudenz for
ress. There, entirely without references, 1
wrote his monumental work, “The Biolog
of War.”
Nicolai first analyses the war-instinct i
humanity, and his conclusions are pro
found, ly interesting now that we are ah
to take a detached view of the phenomenon
War is an instinct which springs from the dee
of mankind, influencing even those who conden
it. It is an intoxication which takes possession o
■all alike. Hut because it is an instinct, it does no
follow that this instinct is ,sacred. Instinct may 1
mistaken, and living beings are deceived by instinc
when instinct fails to adapt itself to cliiUiged e
vironment. '
A striking example quoted is that of a do
scraping with his feet a stone pavemen
lifter depositing excrement. In' this cas
the instinct to cover up tracks has becom
meaningless; “Whole species of lower am
mals became extinct on account of the failin'
to modify instinct.” The author puts th
question : “Is man also ultimately to peris
because of the want of will to change useles
mid dangerous instinctsV We realise witl
Nicolai how imperatively necessary it is t
put under restraint the fratricidal arid sui
cidal instincts of war; otherwise civilisa
tion must perish, Nicolai expresses a pro
found truth when he says that the sight o
his contemporaries giving themselves up to
their enthusiasm for war reminds him of
dog scraping a pavement after relic vim
nature.
Nicolai does not believe that the comba
tive instincts are essential attributes of the
human species, in the sense that stalking
quarry is an essential attribute of the feline
species. They are aberrations,,, lie thinks
for man was originally purely a social am
pacific animal, the most defenceless of al
beings. The hand was useless for defence
and man’s only safeguard was hisgregaribus-
noss. “The social instinct existed long be-
fore family life began. By nature man is a
social being. The drawing together of men
is older and more primitive than war.” How
then did war originate?
War is merely one of the innumerable consequences
of ownership. Whatever the declared aim of war
its real purpose is to despoil man of the fruits o
his labor. Unless a war be utterly futile, its neces-
sary result is the virtual enslavement of a pan
of humanity. A war indemnity is nothing less
than part of the labor of the vanquished party. Wai
pretends to protect private property, but actually it
is an-attack on the rights of every individual.
It involves forced contributions of wealth anil
labor ; the latter is the modern equivalent
of slavery,
Nicolai points out that as our modern
civilisati'on has rendered slavery unneces-
sary, war under modern, conditions is really
meaningless. The ancient civilisations were
based on slavery, and thus, as shivery was
imposed Jiy war, war was necessary to pre-
serve civilisation. With the growth of the
intellect, as man emerged from the barbaric
state, it was necessary that the majority
should work to excess in order that the
learned majority might pass lives of cultured
leisure. But in modern times machines are
doing the work formerly performed by the
slaves, and machinery is capable of un-
limited development. Why, then, did not
war disappear with slavery? Nicolai answers
the question by arguing that in modern times
war is an outcome, partly of the retention
of useless instincts which must be discarded,
and partly of the economic sophism that
national well-being increases proportionately
with the increased consumption of commodi-
ties. This dangerous principle inoculates
people with artificial needs ; arid this holsters
ii]) exploitation and war.
Many modern intellectuals glibly misuse
the theory of the struggle for existence. War,
these people contend, is a method of selec-
tion. a way of ensuring the survival,of the
fittest in the struggle for existence. But:
• Moflei n science shows-that the entire animal world
iloes not yet make use of one twenty-thousandth part
of the available amount of solar energy reaching
the earth. In-these circumstances it is the meanest
and most contemptible of acts for anv section of
men, by mean's of war, to murder others for their
share of energy. Man's proper struggle is not
against his fellows, but with nature, which still
offers a boundless field for him to exploit. Were
man to apply all his combative energy to the util-
isation of the forces of nature, not merely could he
live at ease, but there would he room in’the world
for milliards -of additional human beings. When
compared with this splendid struggle, how puny
seems the great war. .. .In the creative war for
man’s mastery over natural forces, we can. fore-
see victories such as no human being, ho groat armv
could win. ' ’■
Nicolai symbolises the difference between the
destructive and the creative struggle by two
German scientists. One. Professor Haber,
the inventor of asphyxiating bombs'; the
other, Emil Fischer, the brilliant Chemist
who achieved the synthetic production of
sugar. “Fischer.” says Roma in Holland; “is
the forerunner of the new era of humanity
—one of the supreme conquerors, in the vic-
torious struggle for the sources of life.”
Nicolai is neither discouraged nor dis-
mayed by thq colossal size of the modern
war-dragon which he seeks to overcome. The
fact that modern armies have grown to such
gigantic proportions,he regards ns a biologi-
cal phenomenon. “Paleontology' teaches that
all animajs, with the exception of insects,
which for that reason are the oldest inhabi-
tants of the earth., tend to become larger and
larger throughout the ages., till all of a
sudden, just when they seem at their great-
est and strongest, they disappear from the
globe. It is always the large forms of life
that die out. When an organism, in accord-
ance with the laws of growth, exceeds the
limits of its primordial possibilities, it must
die.” Thus it is with war, which is now at
its greatest and “Perhaps,” says
Nicolai, “war has not yet reached its zenith,
but its end is not far off. It will destroy
itself by reason of its own great size. The
final war will be the most terrible and the
greatest of all, as the last of the saurians
was the most gigantic.”

Art and Nationality
I read with real interest and pleasure
the article by Louis Esson (R.P., l/2/’2d)
on Nationality *in Art, hut I remain—re-
luctantly—unconvinced. The case has a good
advocate, but the advocate lias not a good
ease.
Mr. Esson says: “.Art, unlike science, is
national, not cosmopolitan. Physics and
chemistry may be the same everywhere, but
music and painting are not, for they are
the expression of the personality of a race
and country.” Now, in the first place, I
venture to dispute the existence of the "per-
sonality of a race and country.” When we
talk about "national character”- or the "col-
lective mind” we are talking figuratively.
No man believes that a nation or a race has
a character or a mind in the sense that the
individual lias a character or a mind. A
nation has no more a collective iniud, apart
from its individual minds, than it has a
collective body, apart from its individual
bodies. The same is, of course, true of
personality. A nation has no personality
apart from the individual personalities of
wliieh it is composed. Art, therefore, can-
not be the "expression” of the personality
of a race and country, for the simple reason
that no such personality exists. The falsity
of the idea can best be realised by a con-
crete illustration. A us say an
Australian poet—takes for the subject of a
poem what Heine calls the “old, old story”
of disappointed love. flow is he to make
that poem in any rational sense Australian V
How is he to make it the “expression of the
personality of his race and country”? Is
there a special brand of love rightly named
Australian ? If his poem is not to be a
wretched failure, lie will have to forget, when
writing it, all about Australia, and remember
ail about love. , No doubt, the song, when
written, may have a sort of Australian
accent, just as the songs of Burns have a
Scotch accent. But the song will be about
love, which is individual in its very nature,
and its success or failure will depend, not on
whether or not it "expresses the personality
of Australia,” "but on whether or not it
expresses memorably the emotions appro-
priate to its theme. The theme, as a matter
of fact, has been finely treated by two great
poets —Burns in “Bonnie Doon,” and
Lawson in "The Sliprails and the Spur.”
Will anyone dare to say that in either case
there is any attempt to “express the per-
sonality of the race and country”? Burns
gives his song a Scotch setting, and Lawson
gives his an Australian setting. But who
cares two straws for that? We exclaim in
both cases: “How true! How pathetic!”
We never dream of saying: “How Scotch!”
or “How Australian!” The songs are great,
not because of their setting, but because of
their subject; not. because one is Scotch and
the other Australian, but because both ex-
press with beauty and power some of the
most poignant emotions of the human heart.
Art does not, as a matter of fact, associate
itself with nationality, except in patriotic
songs, and the most prominent feature of
patriotic songs is the poverty of their art
and the wearisome monotony of their fatuous
claims to national greatness. If patriotic
songs are to be taken seriously, every nation
in the. world is greater than every other.
No good can come of trying to' produce a
special kind of art which shall be .distinc-
tively Australian. For one thing, fiobody
can tell what distinctively Australian art
is like -“until it has been produced. The aim
should be to produce good art, art character-
ised by sincerity, beauty and truth, and art
about the things that lie nearest to our
hearts and lives. It may come about that
such art, once it is produced, will have cer-
tain qualities which will justify critics in
classifying it as Australian, just as we-classify
a certain- kind of painting as of the Dutch
school or as of the Scotch school. In .other
words, if we aim at producing the best- and
sincerest art of which we are capable about
the things in which we are most deeply inter-
ested, we may produce Australan art. But
its Australian character will come, not as the
result of a deliberate desire to; be Australian,
but as the result of a resolute desire to be
sincere.
The pursuit of art resembles in some
respects the pursuit of happiness. He who
aims constantly at being happy will fail in
the quegt. The way to be happy is to forget
all about happiness ; happiness is a by-
product. And the way to produce Austra-
lian art is to forget all about Australian
art and concentrate on doing good and
honest art work. The Greeks did not aim
at producing Greek art; they aimed at pro-
ducing good art and great art, with the result
that they produced art which was aHonee
truly Greek and truly universe!.

Literary America
Three:' years ago a well-known English
critic said to me that he had hopes of a
literary renascence in America. The state-
ment seemed surprising then. There was
hardly any evidence, unless one went search-
ing about with a microscope. He admitted
that. “There’s evidence of a receptive mind,
though,” he said. “Look at the Dial. Look
at the translations of good European books,
that are coming out in America every day.
America has begun to absorb the best things
available. Soon it will have the impulse to
create.” Since then there has been some

DAVID JONES'—Opp. G.P.0., SYDNEY
justification for his prophecy. No very dis-
tinguished writer has appeared in America,
but books of individual quality have been
coming from that country in greater num-
bers. For the past generation American
writing has been altogether lacking in any
kind of distinction. Loads of best-sellers,
dripping with the standard blend of optimism
and sentiment, trailed past in succession, as
if they had all come from the one factory.
It was a depressing spectacle. It seemed
as if the Americans had a genius for this low
form of production, and would swamp the
world’s markets and debase its standards.
Perhaps one shouldn’t use the past tense.
There still seems to be something in the
American air that militates against quality.
There are the great, glossy magazines that
set the standard and reduce all fiction to
a common denominator of colorless etficiency.
Within a certain limited range they allow
variety of subject-matter and style, but they
are controlled by the taste of a large, un-
sophisticated public that is prepared to pay
for* what it wants. And its wants are so
simple and standardised that any competent
literary tradesman ought to be able to supply
them without effort; in fact, every American
magazine has advertisements from profes-
anxious to teach the technique of this
profitable profession.
Many American writers of real talent have
been seduced by this easy path to wealth
and notoriety. Or, possibly, the matter is
not quite so simple as that. The atmosphere
of American life itself perverts the writers
of real talent, so that they believe they are
doing genuine individual work when they
are merely providing a mechanical article of
the usual pattern. American life is hardly
complex enough to develop really individual
writers. Everyone talks in the same accent,
and has the same thin faith in money,
mechanical progress, the future of the coun-
try and steam-heat. The voice of America
has no undertones or overtones in it. It
repeats its optimistic catchwords in a tire-
less monologue that has the slightly metallic
sound of a gramophone.
And since all literature depends on a per-
sonal vision and a personal accent, it has
been mere waste of time looking for it
among the hordes of American novels that
Jine the bookstalls. From time to time
“sports” like Ambrose Bierce and Stephen
Crane have appeared, but whatever success
they have achieved has been outside their
own country. Jack London, another writer
of . real talent, became a magazine hack,
striving to justify his 15 cents a word by the
discovery of home-grown supermen. If he
had had the right sort of audience, he might
have written something that would last, but
he came to believe in the work that produced
the best results in cash and notoriety.
What is there to justify talk about an
American literary renascence, then? Not
much, perhaps, except a few stray signs and
portents. There seems to be growing up a
school of individual novelists like Joseph
Hergesheimer, Willa Cather, James Branch
Cabell and Sherwood Anderson, who have
thrown the magazine standards overboard.
They have not much to their credit in the
way of positive achievement, but they have
at least given proofs of good faith. Herge-
sheimer bas ventured out into deep water on
the back of Joseph Conrad, and Willa Cather
has carefully studied Knut Hamsun, but
these influences are to be expected. The
important thing is that a new kind of
American writer has appeared, and that
there is a public ready to receive him, as
well as a critical journalism that realises his
significance.
Poetry has had its revival, too, in the
work of writers like Vachell Lindsay,
Robert Frost. John Gould Fletcher and
Edgar Lee Masters. Whatever ultimate
value their work may have, it has certainly
not been done to fill in the odd corners of
magazines. As for drama, there is Eugene
O’Neill, whose “Emperor Jones” has brought
a new color and vitality into the theatre.
O’Neill is probably the most important
writer of all the crowd. He has Jack Lon-
don’s fondness for the primitive without his
belief in cheap science and his tendency to-
ward elephantiasis, and he has already won
recognition in England and France.
But, apart from these names altogether,
there are signs that a change is coming over
America. A book like Sinclair Lewis’s
“Main Street” may have small value as
literature, but the interest and discussion it
has caused prove that America is uneasy
about its standards. Has its simple faith
in money and comfort been shaken by the
war? Or have the penetrating winds of
European literature sapped its confidence
and made it introspective? It seems to be
growing conscious of a world beneath its
feet not dreamed of in Harold Bell Wright’s
philosophy. That means the diseoverv of a
life more intense and many-sided than the
poor rose-water affair that has hitherto been
the substance of its romances.
It is perhaps too much to hope that the
steady stream of cheap American fiction into
Australia will slacken. We have grown used
to those sentimental Kentucky landscapes,
those pictures of strong, silent oil magnates,
those chunks of sugary philosophy from
Eb and Aunt Martha. We may even
provide a market for them when the home
demand has begun to flag. In that contin-
gency it would be better to bar them out
before our taste for them becomes chronic.
At the worst we have writers enough of our
own to supply the home demand for rubbish.
VANCE PALMER.
Those Echoes
When I was 17 and had written nothing
but police-court reports, I was a very blood-
hound on the track of the plagiarists. None
of the guilty, however great, escaped my
wrath. Now, many years nearer to white
whiskers and gout, what affects me most is
not that plagiarism is a sin to inspire uni-
versal horror, but that the critics rate it as
horror-inspiring.
To me, except in some very glaring cases
which are so obvious as to deceive no one,
the proper attitude to most literary appro-
priations and adaptations seems to be that
of my old friend John Mica’wber Falstaff
(call him that), who once ended a press-
table colloquy in a police court by shouting
at an astonished justiciary and at me and
at one Bridget Mulcahy, who was being tried
for an error of judgment in that she had
cast a glad eye upon a constable: —
“Good God, man! How could you drop
a line like that into the ages without making
echoes?”
I will say that John apologised hand-
somely when he realised what he had done,
though not for his sentiments; and when-
ever, after that, I felt inclined to hurl boil-
ing oil at the plagiarists in general, I re-
membered his remark in all charity, and later
bracketed it with one which Jack London
made to me a year or two afterwards: —
“If you want to write, comrade,” said
Jack, “go carefully with the reading. It
gets on your memory and makes pie for you.”
Which saying is, perhaps, the root of the
whole trouble. The basis of all knowledge is
memory. In one’s ability to remember lies
the value of all experience. No writer can
be a writer without both a memory and ex-
perience, any more than he can be a bottle-
washer or a politician without them. But
the human mental machine is just as apt to
become slightly out of gear as any other
machine. The mind is the die-maker of
human mint, and when its associative pro-
cesses are working as they should be work-
ing, the thought-channels which it moulds
should be complete, on both the obverse and
the reverse sides. Sometimes, when ideas
crowd, however, it is apt to make very dis-
tinct obverses without reverses, or with only
very dim reverses, to match, so that the fine
lines of, say, Mr. Chaucer, which are struck
off out of one’s experience of that noble
poet’s work, come out of the die without
anything to identify them with Geoffrey or
with any other person dead or alive. When
that happens, there is often the devil to pay,
and some rude Australian versifier is apt
to be branded as a literary thief.
My own idea of the business is that there
are few deliberate plagiarists, and that this
form of thieving is for the most part an
involuntary crime and quite, pardonable. In
support of this attitude, I suggest that few
of the great ones have not suffered the
charge, and that wherever their guilt is de-
ducible, prima facie, from a comparison of
texts, it will be found to have been achieved
in their early years when their minds were
plastic and impressionable—and enthusiastic
about their masters. More than that, the
literary echo seems to have a special tempta-
tion, not to youth merely, but to youth in a
hurry, whose mental processes are under an
abnormal strain.
The ’Omer—no screed of this kind would
be complete without a reference to ’Omer—
who took his hoe, and his shovel also, and
gently perspired the “Recessional” out of
the works of Francis Quarles and the Gospel
Fathers, was still in his early thirties at the
moment of his lapse, and, according to his
own version, suffering a heavy bombardment
of urgent telegrams from the Times. Be that
as it may. his adaptations had a touch of
genius which was lacking in some of his
earlier “Goings and takings”—witness the
burglary of “a young man married is a
young man marred” from the long dead Ber-
tram, Count of Rousillon, to provide Captain
Gadsby’s best man with a wedding ditty.
Cowper was not far out of adolescence
when he improved Churchill’s
Be England what she will,
With all her faults, she is my country still.
into
England, with all thy faults I love thee still.
Tennyson was yet soft-bearded and alto-
gether far too juvenile for his later sport
of nursing Margot Tennant (aged 20) when
he brewed
A daughter of the gods, divinely tall
And most divinely fair,
from
She’s fair; divinely fair, fit love for gods,
in “Paradise Lost,” and he had only three
years of a very youthful laureateship behind
him when (mark again the circumstance of
hurry and flurry), he found the inspiration
for the rather hackneyed “Six Hundred” in
the infinitely more impressive “Agincourt”
of Michael Drayton:
The very earth did shake.
Trumpet on trumpet spake.
Thunder on thunder.
After all, there could be nothing more
natural than this sub-conscious appropria-
tion of other men’s phrases, which is not
confined as a human habit to the written
word. Humanity has a curious weakness for
certain idiom patterns irrespective of the
time and language in which they appear.
The “Tenes” of ancient Roman slang is
resurrected to-day as “Get me!” “Tangam
senem, etc.,” says somebody in a comedy of
Plautus, written 2100 years ago: “I will
touch the old man (for something).” “Ei
os sublevi!” “I nut it over him!” says an-
other character of the same author.
Recurrences of that Sort make one very
wary in blaming the phrase-thief.
MALOOLM ELLIS.
The Heathen in His Blindness
There are popular gods and unpopular
gods, but it is to the popular gods you must
turn if you would know the mind of a
people. Nor must your definition of a god
be too strict; for fetish-wotship and the
ministry of angels are two phases of the
same phenomenon. To many Puritans the
Bible was far more god than any deity it
revealed ; to many a churchman the church
was much more than its propaganda; to the
sons of Israel the shekel was an object of
far more constant devotion than the mys-
terious Yaweh of the Covenant, who was
only profitable in a general way. Who
doubts that George Washington is a deity
of the United States of America in exactly
the same sense that Buddha—whatever his
philosophy of religion may be—is a god
from Ceylon to Japan? Australia is curi-
ously lacking in divinities, though the oldest
nature gods have been to some extent re-
vived. Both sun and sea have a good follow-
ing, and Labor is worshipped with votes
rather than with the more strenuous libation
of sweat.
Looking at the deities, official and actual,
which hold sway in the world to-day, the
heathen in his blindness does not seem to
call for anything like the amount of pity
bestowed on him. If China, for instance, is
to be judged by its most popular gods, what
is there better worth while that Europe or
American or any of the other missionary
combines of civilisation have to offer?
Here is old Pu-tai Ho-shang, with his left
foot turned up permanently to be tickled,
the god of contentment and jolly laughter.
It is quite impossible to have Ho-shang about
the premises without feeling the better for
his presence. The Chinese artists —to whom
grace and peace be multiplied for ever and
ever! —have seen to that. The meanest bit
of porcelain representing the merry god—and
it is hard to find meanness in the least thing
the potter among the Sons of Han has done
—has the same effect. Ho-shang smiles down
the dynasties, the experiments, the revolu-
tions, the philosophies, the invasions and
even the customs of a land slow to change,
and cheers the last generation as he did the
first. The heathen who conceived Ho-shang
and the heathen who continue to live with
him as a daily companion are hardly blind
enough to call for serious pity.
And for mild benevolence who shall have
eyes to see a finer gentleman than Shou Lao,
the god who presides over long life? The
potter has wrought wonderfully that mild
eye over a milder beard that tells of long,
long thought. Shou Lao lives on Mount
Peng Lai, in the Blessed Isles; but all China
keeps his smile in porcelain. Ho-shang has
a big bag full of the material of fulfilled
desires; Shou Lao holds only the peach of
longevity. It is a fruit that grows upon the
tree Fan Tao, which blossoms every 2000
years and yields its peaches 3000 years later.
Tasting it once, you live for 900 years; but
you are not limited to one bite. Shou Lao
must have eaten it often; only by such a
diet could he have gained the look the artists
have given him.
Kwan-yin inclines her graceful head
towards her worshippers under a draping
veil patterned with sky-blue leaves of the
bamboo. Often she is in pure white; always
she is very gracious. For Kwan-yin is the
lady of mercy, the hearer of cries, the great
sympathetic woman-heart of China that feels
for all its pain. Yet she smiles. Hers is
not the broad smile of Ho-Shang nor the
wise smile of Shou Lao; but something ten-
der. and consoling—a smile to assure you
that behind all the' suffering and pain and
wrong there are quietnesses and places of
peace. Naturally all China brings its worries
to her and she has heard many cries; but her
ears are open to hear more and her smile of
sympathy does not fade. In her attitude
she is something like the great goddess Brigid
before she was mopped up by the Church
and given in exchange for her deity a place
in the second row of saints. The kindness
of Kwan-yin may fail in a big crisis; but
the people are not very blind who regard her
smile as a real asset in the ordinary house-
hold.
These three —Ho-yang, Shou Lao and
Kwan-yin—are the most onnular of the gods
of China ; and China holds the biggest sec-
tion of the world’s heathen. We want a re-
adjustment of values somewhere when con-
sidering the relative blindness of one sort of
believers and another. A household pan-
theon which is merry and wise and kind
might outlast even a reformed prayer-book.
D.M.W.
Shakspeare and “Fat”
In the millions of words written around
the authorship of the plays that go under
the name of Shakspeare, there is a great
deal about Bacon but nothing about “fat.”
Yet it is “fat” that gives the strongest argu-
ment against the idea that the actor, Wil-
liam Shakspeare, wrote the plays. From
Molibre, or, perhaps, Aristophanes, to Oscar
Asche and “Stiffy,” many actors and a few
actresses have written, or helped to write,
plays. There are plenty of instances of
player-playwrights acting in their own plays,
as Shakspeare is alleged to have done. But
when a player-wright appears in a play of
his own devising he naturally and inevitably
takes a big share of the limelight and of
what is known in the profession as the
“fat.” Sometimes he takes it nearly all.
Apart from the instances quoted, Sydney
has lately had a couple-—Louis Benni-
son in “Benvenuto Cellini” and Emelie
Polini in “The Flaw.” Shakspeare was an
actor, and human nature, on the stage and
off, was much the same then as now. We
are told that he w T as a good actor, but even
that is no reason why he should depart from
the universal rule. We do not know much
of the parts that he played. But there is
a test case. To play Hamlet has always
been regarded as the height of every actor's
ambition. If Shakspeare wrote “Hamlet,”
would he not have taken the part himself?
Yet tradition, as recorded by Aubrey and
accepted by Rowe, says that Shakspeare
played not Hamlet but the Ghost. In the
face of this, millions of otherwise intelli-
gent persons, including many actors, have
believed that Shakspeare the actor wrote
“Hamlet.” Is it credible? Such a piece of
evidence hardly needs corroboration, but
Aubrey tells us that in “As You Like It”
Shakspeare took the part of the faithful
old servant Adam, quite a minor role. _ If
he had written the play he would have given
himself something more pleasing to the “old
Adam.”
This negative evidence leaves unsolved
the question of who really did write the
plays. Perhaps it was Bacon, after all,
wildly improbable as the notion seems.
DONALBAIN.
A Satchel of Books
From the Wings, by “The Stage Cat,” edited by
Elisabeth Fagan (Collins). “A funny little dried-
up-looking woman was busying herself about the
church, but did not offer to show him anything.
‘Excuse me,’ he said, ‘are you the pew-opener?’ ‘Well,
sir,’ she replied, ‘the late vicar 'e used to call me
that, but the present incumbrance ’e calls me the
virgin.’ ” This book is a collection of little
stories like that, and enough of them will be
sufficiently unfamiliar to most readers to make the
reading a procession of giggles.
The Flight, by Muriel Hine (John Lane). An
intriguing, well-constructed story, like most of this
writer’s, and, like several of them, about a woman
who married the wrong man. Also, as usual, the
scene shifts from England to the Mediterranean,
which provides variety, anyhow. And the dialogue
is smart: if few people can talk like this on the
spur of the moment, a lot wish they could.
The Wandering Years, by Katharine Tynan (Con-
stable). More pages from Mrs. Hinkson’s discursive
diary. She doesn’t wander far: she was in Ireland
with her husband, a stipendiary magistrate; then
she passed from place to place in England and
Scotland; then through France to Italy. But every-
where she goes she seems to meet interesting people
—or people she can make to seem interesting. Aus-
tralia knows some of them. She was at Hopetoun
as Lord Linlithgow’s guest. “The weight of taxa-
tion was pressing heavily on him. He had been
paying something like 14s. 6d. in the £ in 1919,
and the taxation was increased 25 per cent, later.”
At one of his first political meetings a start was
made to heckle him. “ ‘Whaur did ye get yer
blinkin land, Hopetoun ?’ he was asked. ‘Same as
you got your blinkin’ face —from Daddy,’ replied
Hopetoun.” Arnold Bennett agreed that “literary
circles are poison”—meaning by “literary circles”
the “literary parties” you go to in London. Ade-
laide’s old friend, Bishop Harmer, she met —he
wears his apron now at Rochester. Friends of the
Harmers had recently lost their butler. He was
an old servant and they had pressed him to say
why he was leaving. “If you must know,” he
said, “it’s that after all the years I’ve been here
I’m dead sick of the sight of your faces.” And
there are the Pitt-Riverses. “Captain George Pitt-
Rivers looked a golden youth, and I have referred
to him as such in ‘The Years of the Shadow’. He
was in reality a philosopher and was much annoyed
at being called a golden youth. Mrs. Pitt-Rivers
was a joy to look at and had brains and character
as well as beauty and charm.” His mother, “a
most beautiful woman,” was “the granddaughter of
that Duchess of Somerset who had won the prize of
beauty at the famous Eglinton Tournament, and so
had Sheridan blood.” They were then “selling the
little town of Cerne Abbas,” and that, no doubt, has
something to do with war-taxation, too. So this
entertaining chatterer proceeds for nearly 400 pages,
skipping lightly from pen portrait and anecdote
to sage reflection, and does it all with the utmost
good humor.

The Hidden Symbol.
The torch that feebly flickers low
In the iron stanchion on the wall
Makes one last effort to upglow
And light the hall.
The shadows, a receding wave,
Flee stumbling up the stairs, and there
The shaken marges drift and lave
Feet small and bare.
Two little feet; the torch sinks down,
The shadows tumble down the flight
Of long, still stairs. The small feet drown
In the strange night.
What little feet are these that creep
Down purple-arras’d stairs, unheard?
Into my heart they steal, too deep
For any word
To light them in the shadows. There,
I wait the breathless time when, late
Or soon, they venture down the stair....
And they, too, wait.

The Flowering Poinciana.
This tree which, naked as a nymph, with-
stood
Temptation of unbounded sunlight-gold,
For a few trinkets of light rain has sold
The simple elegance of maidenhood.
Whether she trifled, as a wanton would,
Or pitied hot desires devoutly told,
Seen thus, geranium-warm, . nasturtium-
bold,
She looks more lovely, even if less good.
Perhaps her lover is the gallant gale
That rides to kiss her fingers, or the tall
Young cassia, panoplied in yellow mail,
Or else when night comes (likeliest of
all!)
The passion-pallid lightning, whose embrace
Makes of that mass of bloom one blushing
face.

Rain Song.
Softly, softly, silkily and softly,
Silver fingers stroke your leaves, O summer-
weary trees!
Silky silver limbs curl round in crystal-cool
caresses—
Stealing arms of runlets weave elusive
rhapsodies
Of water-sweet caresses.
In your dripping tresses,
Tangled with our streaming hair, little rap-
tures start
As our cold and phantom bosoms press you,
heart to heart.
Softly, softly, icily and softly—
Can w'e mingle close enough, lovers long
apart?
Kisses, kisses, shivering tears and kisses,
Pearls of passion and pity fall upon your
stricken sleep,
Chapleting your languid blades, sun-wounded
summer grasses,
Stirring anguished memories among your
rootlets deep;
Pale and grieving grasses,
Thus your penance passes :
Mists of grey serenity that veil the searing
blue
Bring you pangs of crisping life to greet the
morning dew.
Quicken to our kisses, piercing, kindling
kisses,
Dream a dream of greenness, and wake to
find it true!

A Joy Night.
No place for discontent
I found at all to-night,
For everywhere I went
Were music, laughter, light.
Grim care I did not meet,
Grey grief I did not see;
In every house and street
Life sported joyously.
Before the velvet breeze,
White-sailed, moved sailing-boats,
And from high balconies
Flowed mirth in silver notes.
The radiant moonlight gleamed
Upon the dancing sea,
Fit place and hour it seemed
For shining melody.
On cheeks and throats that glowed
Love’s dawn tide, blushing, broke;
From open doorways flowed
The joy of happy folk.
“Care comes when day begins,
Take now your fill of joy”—
Thus sang the violins
To dancing girl and boy.
O’er silken sands, tide-swept.
Through pine-trees, plumed and tall,
Across wide waters crept
A cornet’s silver call.
In accents low and sweet
Urged glowing-eyed Delight:
“Move not with hasty feet,
Oh, happy, happy night!
“Men work and women weep,
Age comes that nought can stem ;
What sweeter gifts has sleep
Than these I give to them?
“Snill not the magic wine,
Spoil not its rosy glow ;
This golden hour is mine—
Move slow, O Night, move slow!”

WHAT WOULD THE AUSTRALIAN
DO?
It is not easy to say for certain, because, qs
with the compass, variations have to be
allowed for. But it is fairly safe to assume
that he would do something quaint, bizarre,
unaccountable, and leave the world wonder-
ing what his reasoning processes may be. It
is difficult to imagine, for instance, that any
other white person beneath the sun would
have performed as he did over a big railway
matter a few years ago. Two railway
routes were under discussion. No. 1 led
through Federal territory and public land,
and so would have vastly increased the value
of an area which was every Australian’s
property. No. 2 led through the property of
a mere handful of Australians, and was a
personal or State iob. No. 1 led to a central
range, where there are rivers, and possibili-
ties of making lakes like Burrinjuck, and.
beyond that it traversed fairly watered
country, where, over a great area, the land is
high and the climate good, and where, despite
fearsome distances, there already oxist bright
baby townships such as Alice Springs (a
bigger place than Canberra), Pine Creek,
Newcastle Waters, Daly River, and others.
No. 2 had no ranges and no places to con-
serve water, and no water to conserve. In
fact, it is such a prize pumpkin in the way
of deserts that there is no fresh water for
1050 dull, flat miles, and at the end there is
none either, save what is brought in pipes
from 40U miles further on. A line along
No. 1 route would have saved over 12uo
miles of sea distance between its two ends.
One along No. - would make the distance
between cities 565 miles longer than by sea.
No. 1 would give access to a known and rich
mineral belt, and traverse muck land kt
for settlement. No. 2 would lead to a
partly-exhausted goldfield wkich had a line
already, and traverse country which didn’t
promise lo support one new settler, save
Government othcials and their dependents,
per 106 miles. No. 1 was transcontinental,
and offered a new short road to Europe,
Asia and North America; also the Common-
wealth had accepted from S. Aus. lavish pay-
ment in land grants for building it, so that
its honor was pledged. No. 2 would hug
pretty closely an almost harborless coast;
would open no new route, though it
paralleled an old one; no payment of im-
portance was offered by any State towards
its cost, and there was no shadow of obliga-
tion. What, in such a case, would the Aus-
tralian do? Well, being what he is, an
anomaly, he built No. 2 at great expense, on
the plea, chiefly, that it would be handy for
carrying European letters. No. 1, despite
the payment and the pledge, has never been
started. Now there is talk of abandoning it
altogether, and building instead another
Federal line through purely State property
—West Queensland, to wit—to make the
distance longer, and to avoid the cool up-
lands, and the waters, and the possible
reservoir s'tes. the Australian isn’t sub-
ject to hydrophobia.
Some communities would probably die of
laughter at themselves if they were presented,
for white settlement purposes, with quite an
empire (in size, at least), with rich minerals
and much good soil, and rivers and harbors
and the fee-simple of the land, and little
more liability than the cost of a few public
works. That is to say, they would laugh if,
inside 12 years, they lost about half the
original white population (the remnant being
officials, paupers and some who were so far
from the local seat of Government that they
are outside the curse) ; lost most of the
empire’s industries, most of its bank deposits
and three-fourths of its railway service, and
had one Administration booted off the pre-
mises. Yet there is no evidence that the
Australian even smiles at the result—or
even sniggers. If he had been presented
with Johannesburg in its prime as a Christ-
inas box, one of the remarkable Federal
Governments that he creates would probably
have shut it no also, by well-meaning but
dunderheaded “ordinances,” and it would like-
wise have become a “problem,” and some
famous" bicyclist would have been sent by
Hughes to look at the grass-grown site and
suggest a remedy.
* * * *
One of the Australian’s quaint character-
istics is reflected in a certain “unwritten
law.” It is to the effect that no public
work must be built out of revenue even if
revenue can be had. If sufficient high-
priced loan money can’t be found for ail
purposes works must stand. For years the
country staggered along with few new
telephones and very dilapidated old ones,
though its Post Office was earning about a
million a year surplus to buy or manufac-
ture ’phones with. Now it is proposed, not to
provide the necessary new works, but to find
a way of abolishing the surplus.. There are
Australians who, by reason of the unwritten
law, would perish of hunger at a Gaud
Mayor’s banquet if they suspected that the
victuals weren’t borrowed.
This country is consistently at the top
of the world’s tree in the matter of wool,
while, except in a specially good year, it is
down among the roots in the matter of wheat.
In N. S. Wales, the great sheep State, wool
is a blessing to the Kailway Department,
for it pays a freight which is 2% times the
cost of carriage, and the industry prospers;
while wheat is carried at less than cost,
which is a mighty drag on the railway
finances, and doesn’t prosper except in spots.
The question of what the Australian would
do is easily answered. No local politician
is reckoned worth his salt unless he has a
scheme in his pocket for chasing the sheep
t<> perdition, and planting 38,759 small wheat-
farmers in its place—chasing the sheep
off sheep country and planting the
wheat farmers on what is not wheat
country. Part of the Ma State’s land
policy is to put new men on farms
with the proviso that they may never sell
except to landless men, who are apt to be
moneyless men also, and not even to them
unless the Minister approves, and has time
to ponder over the matter. As succeeding
buyers are under the same disabilities the
property loses perhaps half its value
through “settlement,” and the settler half
his capital. The idea was derived from an
old statute of Billikinland, where certain
classes of real estate could be sold to no one
save a red-headed grass widow. Their value
was low in consequence. Billikinland went
out of cultivation instead of being settled,
because the lack of sufficient red-headed grass
widows made it no man’s country; and it
fell with a great fall: and after the Bilkers
and the Storkwhifflers had divided it no
place except Australia had any use for its
disused old Land Act.
And only the gaily original Australian
could have evolved Canberra from the bowels
of his inner consciousness. In the first
place, certain anti-Federal local potentates of
the least federally-inclined State demanded
possession of the Federal caoital as a reward
for coming in. Then they assumed the right
to select it. by putting a veto on every site
except the one which suited certain State
politicians’ interests. So the metropolis is
situated at the bottom of a sack, about 50
miles from one corner of the country, and
2500 miles from the opposite corner. It is
in two pieces 140 miles apart—this for the
sake of being different. It lies on no main
road or railway, and is dependent on the
Government which owns the surrounding
roads and railways for its news, and its
clothes, and its breakfast-food, and the in-
fant’s pap. It lacks coal, iron, water-power
and a drinking supply except such as is
pumped up to it. Not one of its best friends
makes the shell test effort now to show that
there are any merits or advantages in the
site; still, the work °r>es on—in a fashion.
Anyway, the expenditure goes on. Can-
berra represents the casual, unaccountable
soul of Australia.
“THE COUNTY COUNCIL RED
HERRING.”
Fbom Mr. W. Gbsen, of Peel-street, Tam-
worth (JN'.S.W.) :
As one of the secessionists frcm the New State
movement, I would like to comment on The Bulle-
tin leader of the 15th ult.
I would like, first of all, to say that the number of
secessionists from the New State idea and organisa-
tion is very considerable. Until recently I was
president of the Tamworth League; I therefore
have some knowledge of the position.
Nearly all the original members of the Tam-
worth League are no longer members. A little
over a year ago 200 fully organised leagues existed
in the North. To-day, with the exception of those
in a few of the larger towns, they are dead and
forgotten. Why has this wholesale desertion taken
place? There are several reasons. I will mention
a few.
When the New State idea was first launched per news-
paper propaganda, the people were told that it
would prove the great panacea for the evils of the
North, including Sydney centralisation and rural stag-
nation. Many swallowed this propaganda holus-
bolus without giving it much thought. Meantime
they have been thinking—hence the desertions.
Another reason is the violent and stupid language
of some of the Northern papers. Here is a sample
from the Tamworth Northern Daily Leader
(Feb. 6) :—“Nearly all Northern railways are non-
paying owing to the policy of the State in pur-
posely running them at a loss to suit the con-
venience of Sydney.”
After reading The Bulletin article very care-
fully I am of the opinion that the arguments you
have used in support of the Naw State idea are
not convincing. You seem to infer that population
would flow to any inland town that might be de-
clared a new State capital. What sort of popu-
lation? Would they be people who would culti-
vate the primary resources of the country or would
they be merely an army of Civil servants? You
say that the New States would open up and equip
their own ports. Will you tell the people of the
North Coast which port they should opeiv and equip ?
You might also tell them how to gefj over all
the numerous difficulties—engineering and' financial.
For the last' 50 years they have been wrangling
on the merits or lack of merits of the various
proposed ports; they cannot come to a decision
themselves. You might be able to advise them. Could
you tell your readers how much the Government
of N.S.W. has spent, and is spending, on trying
to make ports on the North Coast and also on bar-
dredging to enable the rivers to be navigable? It
would be interesting information, and I think the
magnitude of the amount would astound many.
You say the State divisions are too large for
effective government. I thoroughly agree with you.
1 would go further and say that the proposed New
State is also too large for effective government and
administration. It is for that reason that I and
many others are advocating the establishment of
county councils. May I explain my point by giv-
ing a personal reminiscence? I went to the Armi-
dale New State conference as a delegate from Tam-
worth. I was then an ardent New State advocate.
It was at this conference I recognised the fallacy
of many of the arguments (including yours) put up
in support of the creation of a New State in the
North. The one great discovery 1 made was this.
If the New State was created the people of the
North Coast would fight with those living south
of Armidale like Kilkenny cats, because we Tam-
worth people have nothing in common with the
North Coast and many interests that are conflicting.
Even at this preliminary conference one could see
the evidence of smouldering fire and hostility.
They (the North Coasters) would have nothing to do
with Newcastle and would not entertain the idea of
it being included in the New State—they said
they were afraid of the industrialists. They were
also terribly afraid of Port Stephens, thinking that
money would be spent there, to the detriment of
some of the more northern rivers and roadsteads.
The gentlemen from the cow-pastures were the
most parochial crowd I had ever struck. At that
conference the idea was forced into my mind that the
county council was the solution, and not the
New State. The far North Coast would make an
ideal county or provincial council. New England
would make another, or, perhaps, better still, the
present Federal electorates could be adopted as areas
suitable in which county councils could be formed.
The county council idea is already operating in
the North. Last week a conference was held in
New England to consider the formation of
a county council for the purpose of hydro-
electricity development—a conference for a similar
purpose has also been held on the North Coast.
We in Tamworth, if we had such a council, could
do much to help ourselves. We could conserve
water in the Peel Valley for one thing. The
Namoi people could also get on with their water
conservation scheme.
For rural development we do not want a New
State with ail its brand-new governmental machinery,
involving extra expense,' confusion and jealousy.
All we want is the right to develop our rural
possibilities, and I maintain the county council
provisions of the Local Government Act give us that
right. The prize—extended Local Government—lies
at our feet; we only need stoop and pick it up.
* * * *
A few friendly words in reply :
There are always weak-kneed and ephemeral
brethren who can’t stick to any one matter long
enough to achieve success, and Australia may have
more of them than many countries because it is
so long since it faced the realities of life. It
began its career as the rich man ? s petted son very
long ago. Easily-won gold was found—stupendous
quantities for the small population of those days.
The people realised that Providence had given
them an immense estate gratis, and for a while they
lived practically tax-free by selling it. Then they
borrowed a trifle ( £458,400,000 at June, 1921, and
nearly £500,000,000 now), quite apart from war
charges, to pave the primrose way. When a
languid community lets the main entrance to its
greatest city become impassable, and then top-
dresses it badly out of loans, its fixity of purpose
is in a suspended condition. So leagues come and
go. There have probably been a dozen Sydney
Harbor bridge leagues in the last 60 years, but
their failure so far doesn’t prove that the bridge
is a bad thing, and that its advocates should com-
promise on a new letter-box or a macintosh.
Some points: (1) It isn’t proved that Separation
wouldn’t be “the great panacea for the evils of the
North, including Sydney centralisation and rural
stagnation.” Separation proved very beneficial for
these evils in the cases’of Maoriiand, Tasmania, Vic-
toria and South Queensland. (2) There is nothing
“violent and stupid,” except to the milk-and-water
mind, about the Tamworth paper’s remark re Nor-
thern railways. In fact, it is very obvious truth.
(3) The Bulletin does “seem to infer” that popu-
lation would flow to any new State capital, assum-
ing it wasn’t the sort of place that only absolute
lunacy would select. In this couhtry population
has always flowed to even badlv-situated State
capitals, and (save for mining fields, which are
temporary at best) it has flowed nowhere else. Hence
the biggest Australian capital has 950,000 people,
and tne biggest place which is neither capital nor
mining held has 24,318. (4) Mr. Green certainly
may ask what kind of people the new population
would be. They would be ordinary human beings
with two legs and one head apiece, and they
wouldn’t be unlike the 110,000 or so who work
in the factories of 'Sydney. . (5) As to what ports
should be equipped, perhaps the best way would
be to begin with the ports that are there, and leave
those which never were, or which are somew T here
else, for future consideration. (6) As regards the
“numerous difficulties,” in some States the outports
manage their own affairs, which is also a common
habit in the U.K. and elsewhere. (There was onqe
one lonesome Harbor Board on the N.S.W. South
Coast, but it was abolished, and the work trans-
ferred to Sydney). Little places like Burnie (Tas.),
Bundaberg (Q.) and Bunbury (W.A.), to stick to
one initial, face their own difficulties somehow. It
requires a little grit, and not too many cold feet.
(7) As for the amount of the North’s revenue con-
tributions that the Sydney Government spent on
Northern ports—which ports, under its management,
didn’t eventuate —it is hard to get at, and it is of
no more importance in the argument than the amount
that was spent on trawlers that didn’t trawl.
Supposing the New State is too big, it can be
subdivided later. Supposing there are competing
ports, they can (all the real ones) be made avail-
able in time. A glance at the map of little Scot-
land, or even little Tasmania, might show how
this is done when there is a desire to do it. The
essential point is that the North wants control of
its own revenues, its ports, its railways and its
railway-building, and the county council idea
surrenders them all. It is the “prize” that “lies
at our feet” —in the mud, that is, where the
things of no account are found.
IN DARKEST KEDAH.
I shall not soon forget the days I spent in
darkest Kedah, if only for the hours passed
in mosquito-netless nightmare. Kedah is
one of the latest of the Malay States to
come under British suzerainty. Complete
control dates only from 1909. Previous to
that the heavy and capricious hand of Siam
lay upon tne country. Kedah sent: every
year to the Siamese court a golden flower
m token of subjection, and in return was
allowed to mismanage its affairs to the best
of its ability, Siam occasionally emphasis-
ing its authority by devastating the country.
The dull and lascivious Sultans lived
amongst their women, solacing the awful
tedium of court life with the charms of
opium, the excitements of the cockfight and
the occasional murder of a courtier. Their
sole function was to draw their revenues
from the gambling and opium farms, which
were conducted by Chinese, and to expend
them in magnificent entertainments. The
wedding of a son of the Sultan occupied
months and consumed the revenues of years.
Assassination was the instrument of justice.
The point of a kris, inserted just below
the collarbone and slowly waggled down-
wards to the heart, was the metnod of exe-
cution.
It was Francis Light, the founder of
Penang and father of the famous founder
of Adelaide, who in 1771 first brought Kedah
into prominence in the annals of the East
India Co. That intrepid adventurer and
builder of empire, whose prophetic vision
and sanguine temperament were inherited
by his son, found his way into the muddy
mouth of the Kedah River, stirred the Sul-
tan out of his lethargy, and, after lengthy
negotiation and much obstruction from botfl
Danish and Dutch agents who were already
in the favor of the court, obtained from
him the cession of Pulau Pinang, an unin-
habited island off the coast, for the pur-
poses of a British settlement. Yague prom-
ises of protection against the Sultan’s ene-
mies were made by the East India Co., but,
in accordance with its immemorial charac-
ter, it repudiated these promises, and Kedah
was redelivered to the fury of the Siamese.
William Light, the son, never fully real-
ised the dream of a well-ordered city be-
cause of the treachery of his employers and
the jealousy of his contemporaries; Francis
Light, the father, was thwarted by the bad
faith of the native rulers and the greed of
his directors. Interest in what might have
been, had Light had his way. one of
Britain’s richest possessions in the East,
became obscured by the rise in power and
importance of Penang and Singapore. The
Sultan retired into his harem. His Ministers
bled the Chinese, who robbed the people.
Illanun pirates ravaged the coast and Sia-
mese officials oppressed the interior. Trade
languished. Agriculture was the furtive oc-
cupation of a few. The capital dwindled
to a collection of tumbledown huts presided
over, by a tumbledown palace where a de-
crepit Sultan sat and brooded amongst his
tumbledown wives. Nothing could be more
deplorable than the condition of this Oriental
kingdom left to manage its own affairs. Within
60 miles of it Penang rose to be a city and
a great port. Steamers passed daily along
the coastline of Kedah, and the passengers,
gazing at the blue outline of its lofty peak,
famous in Malayan folklore, knew as little
of its potential wealth as of its diseased
condition and its anarchy. Not until a
dozen years ago was the veil lifted. The
Sultan, having pledged all his resources and
a good bit over to the Chinese, applied to the
Siamese for a loan. The loan was granted
and with it a British adviser to apply a
little simple arithmetic to the Sultan’s hap-
hazard financial transactions. In 1909 the
Siamese relinquished all authority and
Kedah came entirely under British protec-
tion.
It would be interesting to see what a few
years of British control had done for this typi-
cal Oriental sultanate, in which government
had been a mixture of terrorism and intrigue.
Two rival steamship lines run to Alor Star,
the capital of Kedah. In this backward
country, apparently, steamship companies
have, not yet discovered the advantages of
combination over competition. if you
travel as a native you may go for ten cents,
with a banana and cup of coffee thrown in.
If you are a European you are charged five
dollars; this is one of the disabilities under
which the natives groan. The little steamer
threaded her way along the coast between
lovely wooded islands. One, rich in turtles’
eggs, was a monopoly of the Sultan. Three,
in close proximity to each other, were Jcera-
mnt or sacred, and a slow and mysterious
disease smites the sacrilegious who sets foot
thereon.
At the mouth of the Kedah River stands
the wreck of a fort where the Siamese, in
1821, massacred some thousands of Malays.


Four cannon of primitive pattern still point
futile muzzles through the embrasures. One
is called Arong Darah, the Wader through
Blood, and in the old days, before the EngLsh
drove the guardian spirits of the country into
the mountains, this terrible weapon used, m
the heat of battle, to load and fire itself.
In the midst of a vast mudswamp given
over to crocodile, Alor Star forms an oasis
of surprising activity. Its streets are broad
and well laid-out. Behind the town is an
apparently limitless expanse of rieefields, a
European quarter full of fine bungalows and
inviting-looking gardens, a golf-course and
an English club whose inviolable. custom
it is to include in every round of drinks pro-
posed by any person the entire membership
of the club. We left the road to go to
Bangkok, and turned in at the club that had
this pleasing custom. A couple of Malay
tunkus were playing billiards. The tunkus,
who in the dark days maintained a precari-
ous footing at the court by means of
stratagems and bribes, now own elegant
establishments and stables stocked with Aus-
tralian horses, play golf and administer the
finances, the police and other departments
with the same sagacity they used to show in
keeping in the Sultan's favor. Malay is the
sole medium of correspondence and inter-
course. The Mohammedan calendar is ob-
served, and in entering Kedah we are in the
year A.H. 1337 or thereabouts, while in point
of view of progress, or let. us say develop-
ment, we are in the very forefront of the
20th century. Except for the advice and
assistance of a handful of white officials the
state is administered entirely by natives. It
has posts and telegraphs, and a railway con-
necting it with the F.M.S. system. Its chief
export is rice, and the revenue, from being
a few years ago a negligible and unascertain-
able quantity, is now a definite and very
handsome figure. In 1909 it was a million
dollars, and in 1918 it had risen to over five
million dollars. Kedah is one of the few
happy countries that nowadays can balance
their budgets. With a revenue in 1918 of
5,058,998 dollars its expenditure was only
3,785,536 dollars, and its public debt was a
mere baby of 2,720,953 dollars. Such are
the consequences of applying simple
arithmetic to problems of state.
The Malay princes recognise the material
advantages foreign control has brought them
and have ceased to regret the old lawless
days of glory and indigence. The Sultan,
alone, too old to respond to the radical in-
fluences of the new regime, has retired into
his palaces, where, amongst submissive women
and a few sycophantic favorites, ho doubt-
less listens to the court musicians singing
praises of his wisdom and magnificence.
We went elsewhere, where the real future
of Kedah lies. Chinese coolies under the
sweltering sun were digging a cutting
through a hill, working in a desperate frenzy
as if their lives depended on it, although
their half-caste overseer was asleep under
an umbrella. Other coolies were building a
bridge, across a river, from the other side
of which a thin line of railway led straight
off over the quivering horizon towards Bang-
kok. Later there will be a route right
through to India and one will be able to
travel from London to Singapore in a fort-
night or less. A swift ferry will take one
from Singapore to Java in a day, one will
rail the length of Java in two more days,
and then another ferry will take one across
to Port Darwin, which, in this hypothetical
future I am talking about, will have been
linked up by rail with Adelaide. It was
curious to look on the shabby beginnings
in that desolate clearing in the jungle of
what will some day be a famous highway
between Europe, Asia and Australia.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Cold Weather Among the Public
Enterprises.
Public Enterprise (Federal or State or
municipal) is the noble theory of preventing-
monopoly and reserving the profits for the
community. Australia has given it a large
and patient trial, as proved by the existence
of about £500,000,000 of State public works
debt, and an Alp of Federal and municipal
liabilities. The verdict is that the
theory is wrong; that we are not the right
people, or don’t know how to find the right
people, to run it even if it isn’t wrong; or
that the comic-opera anomaly of borrowing-
money from Private Enterprise with which
to conduct Public Enterprise, so as to keep
Private Enterprise out of it, lias made the
noble theory an ignoble joke. In N.S.W.,
where the situation is extra-bad, the position
is that in all works built by Public Enter-
prise Private Enterprise is a cumulative
5i per cent, preference shareholder owning
the entire capital, which is all cumula-
tive preference; whereas, if Private Enter-
prise had built and owned the works itself,
it would have been lucky to drag more than
half that amount out of its victims. It
would have been an ordinary shareholder —-
very ordinary. Thirteen years ago, when the
interest which Public Enterprise paid to
Private Ditto was 3J per cent., and the
money wasn’t invested in mad fishshops and
similar things, the situation wasn’t hope-
less, but now it is past praying for. The
last few weeks have been an unbroken chron-
icle of disaster. The new Federal Govern-
ment allowed some preliminary facts to leak
out concerning the Commonwealth shipping
line. They corroborate the suspicions
aroused by the contemptuous and continuous
refusal of the Sultan Hughes to publish a
balance-sheet in his capacity of arrogant and
inefficient trustee. The loss may be anything
up to £9,000,000, the result of partial failure
to provide for ordinary depreciation;
complete failure to provide for the
slum]! in prices, so that vessels stand
in the books at three or four times
what they would fetch; extraordinary
costs of running, incurred to show that the
Ministry was a jolly good fellow; and amaz-
ing charges for construction, taken on in the
spirit of bonhomie and camaraderie, to prove
that Codlin was the friend—not Short. If
to the losses on ships that really belonged to
the fleet is added the deficit on wooden vessels
that died in infancy, so to speak, the vanish-
ment of supposed assets appears to be more
than £9,000,000, and ■ the fleet of 51 vessels
resolves itself into some 10 realities and 41
dubious or hopeless arks; and the passion
for being an ideal, easy-going boss makes the
earning capacity of even the best ships doubt-
ful. Tbe next biggest revelation is a State
affair —Ma State, naturally. It is officially
estimated that out of the ±14,000,000 of loan
money spent in putting soldiers, many of
them not in the least agricultural, “on the
land,” £5,000,000 is already lost. It must
be recognised as such, for the attempt to
collect it would only ruin the unfortunate
debtors, and lose the other £9,000,000, about
some of which there are grave doubts.
N.S.W. has also found an overdue bill of
£740,000 for wheat that went into its pool
and was apparently drowned there as far
back as 1918. It has been decided to sell
the S_tate timber business, and cut the loss
of £250,000 (this is the concern which lately
discovered that £36,000 worth of boards and
planks had dissolved into thin air) ; also to
abandon the fish industry, which has been
a wretched matter of heads and tails and
scales and innards, and cut that loss also —
said to be betwen £lOO,OOO and £200,000. A
loss of about £300,000 on the Federal fruit
pool of 1921 is mentioned. A gentleman
named Driver is making brisk headway with
a demand for £121,000 for losses said to
have been sustained through the big-footed-
ness of the War Service Homes Department.
That body is also clearing up debris of its
own in Queensland, and doesn’t expect to
lose more than £250,000. In addition the
procession of chronic money-losers goes on as
usual —the East-to-West railway line, many
other lines, the Murrumbidgee irrigation
settlement, and the rest of the tough old
innumerables. Everywhere is talk about
the necessity to “write down capital”—
mostly loan capital. But when the Govern-
ment “writes down capital” it doesn’t write
down capital. The way to do that is to
pay the loss out of the shareholders’ pockets,
as joint-stock companies do, so that the
money is no longer owing, nor is it collect-
ing interest or dividends. The Government
merely transfers a few millions of loan lia-
bility from the marine account, where there
are alleged to be ships to set against it, to
some general loan account, where there are
no ships or other assets.
The A.W.U.’s Career of Folly.
Twelve months ago the A.W.U. bosses, then
cockahoop, boasted that their organisation
had 113,163 members. At the recent annual
conference, which was in every respect a
depressing affair, it was admitted that the
number had dwindled to 96,899, a slump of
over 14 p.c. But the figure thus given to
the world is grossly misleading, for tne mem-
bership lists were made up on May 31 —that
is to say, before the disastrous strike against
the Powers award for shearers and shed-
hands had got into its stride. Of that
strike the new president, John Barnes, who
has succeeded the fluent and incapable
Blakeley, confessed that it had been a
failure in N. 8. Wales, Victoria and Tas-
mania. What the failure cost the union,
in loss of members, fees and money actually
paid to the strikers (who have been granted
“continuity of membership'’ as a reward for
going broke at the executive’s instance), he
did not explain. But enlightening state-
ments were made by other conterencers.
“Whenever our membership slumps,” said
Gbayndler, the general secretary, “it is
due to strikes.” “There has been a big
shrinkage in membership,” said Dunstan, a
Queenslander, and a Westralian delegate
testified that 90 per cent, of it was attribu-
table to “the disruption in the pastoral in-
dustry last year.” The W.A. man couldn’t
have been referring to his own branch’s
attempt to hold up the shearing, for that
happened in 1921. It was such a fiasco
that the W.A. pastoral workers didn’t join
in the strike against the Powers award ; on
the contrary, they agreed to start for ss. a
hundred less than the Powers rate, both
sides pledging themselves to abide by the
award, which had not -then been delivered.
As for the W.A. mining branch, it has fallen
so low that its officers were authorised by
the conference “to make the best possible
arrangements for carrying on the affairs of
the union, as numbers of members failed to
take out their tickets by October 1, and
thus placed difficulties in the way of filling
all positions on the branch executive.”
Before the war the Westralian miners had
one of the most prosperous and wisely-
administered unions in the Commonwealth.
It was the proud boast of the Kalgoorlie and
Boulder branch that it had carried on for
20 years without a strike. But in an evil
hour for the miners the bosses of the
shearers’ union were allowed to take charge
of their flourishing organisations, knowing
nothing about the industry and very little
about the psychology of the miners. The
results of A.W.U. control have been absolutely
disastrous, not only at Kalgoorlie, but at
Moonta (S.A.), Mt. Morgan (Q.) and Mt.
Lyell (Tas.) as well. So parlous is the
condition of the Tasmanian branch of the
union, which is, or used to be, composed of
miners, pastoral workers and general
laborers, that its operations have been sus-
pended for 12 months. In the official
returns its membership is alleged to be
1437, but “I doubt whether it is 200,” said
Dunstan aforesaid, and it was stated with-
out contradiction that “in some of the
Speck’s biggest mining centres we are down
to about 50 members.” That is what comes
of rushing into unwieldy composite unions
and allowing the affairs of distant industrial
communities to be run by self-advertising
Labor politicians or class-war maniacs at
Sydney. The A.W.U. heads had magnificent
opportunities. With a membership of, say,
100.000, an annual revenue running into
six figures, and enormous reserves of capital,
obtainable by means of levies, they might
have established in a few years the greatest
chain of co-operative enterprises in Australia.
But they have dissipated their power and
frittered'away their revenues by running the
union for the union official, and plunging
into a blighting succession of stop-work
enterprises and strikes. Owing to their
stupendous arrogance and folly the mining-
branch of the organisation is a mouldering
ruin, and tens of thousands of pastoral
workers, once loyal to the A.W.U. in all emer-
gencies, have been driven into revolt.

Country Freights and City Trams.
The conclusions of an engineer with large
experience in works construction:—
“Unproductive country railways built for develop-
mental purposes are leaning heavily upon Sydney’s
tram-users,” is a sample wail from a Sydney paper.
The trouble of “unproductive country railways” is
not, however, explained by any of those newspapers
which use the phrase as a peg to hang further de-
mands for the addition of other favors to those
already enjoyed by the residents of this luxurious
Sydney. The voiceless section of the country popu-
lation has had freights nearly doubled in the last
eight years, and if the motor-truck had not exposed
the grossness of the charges to such places as
Bathurst, there is little doubt the freights would
have been raised still further. The demand that the
coming year’s loss on the railways shall be borne
by the community as a whole, while Sydney passen-
ger rates are still further reduced, is all of a piece
with the many other city demands, and it is appal-
ling to note how the Government bends to such
clamor.
The following indicates why so many N.S.W.
country railways are unproductive:—
1. The immense expense on (at present) unneces-
sary duplication of main railway lines, which ex-
pense is adding to the interest bill at a rate faster
than the Commissioners can raise the rail freights.
No benefit has accrued to the country districts by
such duplication; on the other hand, each mile of
line has increased freight charges.
2. Not enough new feeder lines are being built.
The non-completion of an important line like the
North Coast displays an entire lack of any financial
instinct on the part of someone. The millions now
being spent on duplications and deviations might
better be spent on finishing partly-constructed lines,
so that they might begin to earn the interest now
tied up in their disconnected joints.
3. The accruing interest on the misplaced expen-
diture reacts and produces the steadily increasing
rail freights, and these in turn slowly but surely
smother one country industry after another.
4. Some new spur lines do not pay because they
have not been in existence long enough to bring
about settlement. The future of this country depends
on its development by way of railroads and, inter
alia, water conservation, points which the city for-
gets—when it suits.
5. A three years’ drought.
6. The persistence in running expensive steam haul-
age on lines that should have been fitted with motor
haulage years ago.
7. The deficits on many of the lines are probably
in part imaginary, due to the railway method of
book-keeping, which only' credits, for instance, a
30-mile spur line with 30 miles of freight, even if
it brings £20,000 a year of traffic on to the main
line. The spur line may be credited with £2OOO,
but £lB,OOO is credited to the main line. This
system shows a great profit for the main line and
a horrible loss for the spur line.
8. The centralisation of control in Sydney instead
of having long ago installed a system of railway
districts under the control of superintendents, with
power to sack, without review by any Sydney' Board
of Appeal having strings on it for members of Par-
liament to pull. There are probably 15,000 men
on the pay-sheets who do not earn salt, but who
draw their pay and help to keep up the cost of
freight. *
9. A reconstruction of design is called for, so
that steels of higher tensile strength shall be
used and so cut down the weight of carriages, trucks,
etc., and save the haulage of thousands of tons per
day of dead-weight construction.
10. More powerful locomotives and larger capacity
freight-trucks are needed. You could search Canada
and the U.S.A. and you would not find one of the
abortions we call trucks in use on over 300,000
miles of railway.
11. Probably the largest saving of all could be
made by running a new railway to the Western Dis-
tricts from Newcastle through the gap in the moun-
tains, and saving the intolerable cost of hauling all
our western products from 2500 to 3000 feet into
the air over the Blue Mountains to finally arrive at
sea-level. The Newcastle people know all about the
proposed route. So do the Commissioners. So does
the Government. But none of the Sydney dailies
breathe a word about it.
12. One cause of the heavy capital charge with
its fearful interest bill (apart from the really un-
necessary enormous expense of duplication) is the
cost of immense deviations in the mountains and
other places, now being done under the guise of dup-
lication work. In the past these deviations were
openly discussed in Parliament and always were they
recommended because of the great savings they were
to create. All that the country person knows about
them is that, where he used to be, say', 350 miles
from Sydney, he is now 360 miles distant, due to
the length of the many deviations, and he conse-
quently has to pay 10 miles more freight than he
had to do before the deviations were done. It is
difficult, therefore, to show the country man
where the benefit is going to lie in, say, the costly
deviation now in progress at Marangaroo, on the
Western line, with its f-mile of a tunnel and miles
of additional railway line. This perpetual tinkering
with the lines has led to an amazing state of affairs.
In many places on the mountains, and as far west
as Orange, the line has been re-built as often as
three times. Vast sums have been spent on these
alterations, but has the cost of any of these old
roads been wiped off as depreciation, or are they
still carried as a tangible asset on which the country
freights are based? And it doesn’t stop; you can
go out West and see new deviations—not duplica-
tions —being constructed within a few y'ards of the
old line. It is all a horrible waste of money, a
source of a constantly-growing interest bill, and a
sure cause of further freight increases.
No lesson has been learnt from the fable of the
goose that laid the golden egg. The city yells for
more money to be spent within its bloated precincts,
the country residents decide to come and live where
they can get a return ticket to cover 150 miles for
10s. or thereabouts, as against the 30s. one haft to
pay for the same distance, so long as one stops out
west or south or north. There can be the Bol-
shevism of a Trotsky or Lenin, which has proved to
be reasonably effective in bringing about the damna-
tion of a country, but it is open to argument if
Trotsky’s crude methods are likely to be more effec-
tive than the fulfilment of the policy insisted upon
in some of the Sydney dailies in regard to country
railways and city tramways.
The Case of Bill.
Victoria reckons itself a law-abiding com-
munity because so small a proportion of- its
population is in gaol. Other States also pre-
sent themselves with smug testimonials about
the emptiness of their prisons, but none is
quite so smug as Victoria. Yet the State
might almost be described as rotten with un-
punished crime, mostly of the brutal and
violent sort, ranging from wife-beating, rob-
bery with violence and violence without rob-
bery to systematic terrorism and brisk
battles between hostile clans in which, it must
be admitted, no heavy artillery is used as
yet, though almost everything Vise is. The
visible catises are the cheap and horrid J.P.,
the jury-squarer, and the patient ass of a
Government which has for so long tolerated
them both. The J.P. saves the cost of a
qualified police magistracy, just as the cost
of Supreme Court Judges might be saved if
they were replaced by honorary retired
grocers with a liking for publicity. The .T.P.
on the bench, administering the law which
he never learned, is a fussy nonentity, and
often a senile one. Sometimes he is sus-
pected of being a corrupt one in addition.
Anyhow, the amazing sympathy with crime
of the more brutal sort manifested by some
of the most regular attendants on the bench
could most easily be understood if it trans-
pired that they were salaried by the Amal-
gamated Thieves and Thugs’ Association to
be on hand to impose a petty fine, and to
make sure that the matter didn’t go to a
higher court and involve the expense of
scjuaring the jury. Victoria is accustomed
to its J’s.P. and takes them philosophically,
but it was moved a little the other day by
the tale related in the divorce court by a
smallish woman with a broken nose, one eye
and mixed disfigurement, all of long stand-
ing. Her husband Bill (most nefarious
husbands are Bill, and, of coiu-se, he was
a “laborer”) had supplied the shattered nose
first. Later he deserted his wife, and left
her to keep- house on her own account. But,
being interrogated by the police in the street
about some matter, for which interrogation
it doesn’t seem that the wife was respon-
sible, the dander of Bill arose. He broke
into the house of the smallish woman by
night, put out one of her eyes, smashed sev-
eral of her ribs and her furniture, and left
her apparently dead. When located by the
Law, the best part of a year later, this un-
toward violence cost Bill 40s. (£2). The
report neglected to mention who was the
Minister of the day—the placid and cow-like
Minister who was not moved to anger by
this .matter, and to the abolition of the J.P.
system. Any overworked, undermanned and
ill-paid police force is liable to grow lax in
its search for Bill when these are all the
results in the lower courts, while in the
higher court, if Bill can be got there, the
necessary disagreeing juryman is supplied
for a mere trifle.' The other day, when the
jury-squaring scandal had reached its 21st
birthday or so, fat and comfortable Lawson
dragged himself out of repose sufficiently to
abolish the old method by which the names,
addresses and occupations of prospective
jurors were supplied well in advance to
squarers and all other applicants. It is some
improvement, though the adoption of the
Scotch idea of 15 jurors and a majority ver-
dict would have been better if Lawson could
have got out of his old English rut. Then
there would be hope that the squarer would
stick to his vocation, and land in gaol
through trying the impossible job of pur-
chasing eight jurymen in one lot. Nobody
except in old demented Poland ever enacted
that Parliament must attain unanimity be-
fore anything could be done, nor is it ex-
pected of a company meeting, or an election,
or a local option poll. Possibly, when Law-
son comes back to Melbourne, fattened and
refreshed, he may next do something with
Shallow, J.P. Some good might result if
a long list of offences, the Bill Sikes
variety more especially, had affixed to them
three months and no option. But at the
best that would make Shallow an auto-
maton, and the idea of an automatic J.P.
has no attractions. And at the worst Shal-
low would get over the difficulty by finding
Bill not guilty, and the Treasury would
lose 40s.

The Case for an Improved Poisons Act.
The manifesto of the Young Communists’
League has been published in the papers. Some
time ago it became known that a collection
of Sunday schools had been established to
train the infant mind in the doctrines of
the people who burnt Paris in 3871; who
created the ridiculous fiasco of New Aus-
tralia-in-Paraguay; who have introduced
famine and cannibalism into Russia; who
brought about the squalid slaying of
Ananias and Sapphiba in Holy Writ.
Just as the young soldiers of the regiment
of Prentice Knights, in the “No Popery”
army with which Lord George Gordon
started to destroy London, grew out of
their apprenticeship and became the United
Bulldogs, so it would seem that the first
crop of baby Vengeances and Petroleuses
and Destroying Angels has passed the Sun-
day school age, and finds it time to organise
for active war on civilisation. The mani-
festo of Infant Communism is to the effect
that “the workers are forced down to” some
old thing or other, and deals with the need
for “a classless form of society,” the “es-
tablishment of a Workers’ State,” the numer-
ous Australians who “are now starving on
the streets,” the beauty and blessedness of
things in Russia, etc. The members are to
be between 14 and 26, and are to obey the
orders of the League bosses- —not of the
State. It was recorded that when “Jock”
Garden, of N.S.W. Labor Council, was
leaving Moscow, where he had gone to get
instructions about the guidance of Aus-
tralia, Trotsky, the Russian Jew, put
a fevered hand in that of his disciple, and
told him to capture the children and he
(“Jock”) could be the dictator or Moses
Robespierre of Australia, answerable in
the name of freedom to no law save such as
he made for himself. “Bring up a child
in the way he shouldn’t go,” said the Jew
Who Knew, “and when he is grown he will
be a lot worse than you might expect.” And
when one considers the staying power of
every creed that is or was possessed of life
and color, it seems the nefarious Hebrew
was right. Whether it is Mormonism, Mo-
hammedanism, Thuggism, Communism 'or
Druidism with human sacrifices, it is only
necessary that children should be brought
up in it, and when grown up they are
liable to propagate it—by violence, if pos-
sible. Then if it is a creed that involves the
abolition of civilisation, it is necessary to
use violence to put it down. And as it is
beastly unpleasant to have to order a gen-
eral killing, as the British did with the
Thugs of India, or even a partial one, as
Adolphe Thiers did with the Communists
who set Paris ablaze, the State, as the
supreme educational authority, should take
account of the misdirection of the plastic
young mind of its property. For its young-
citizens are its property —not that of a gang
of cranks or Fagins, instructed from Mos-
cow or any other foreign centre. Also, if
need arises, they are its future army of
defence. Wherefore certain teachings should
be put under the Poisons Act.

spillers who earn guineas, and gratify the malice
of the half-educated, by girding at distinguished
Australians. When abroad she gets some respite
from the envy and uncharitableness of fellow-
countrymen, but she is an unfailing source of beer-
money to the Bludyers of Melbourne and Sydney
when at home. So is Asche when he comes back.
But Asche has been treated with such chilling indif-
ference by the playgoing public—which, at the
same time, went rather mad about “Sally” and “The
O’Brien Girl”—and has been pursued with such a
roar of malignity by some of the writing men,
that his third tour of Australia is likely to be his
No historian of the British theatre would
refuse Asche a place among the outstanding figures
of the time. He is admittedly the finest living
Petruchio, and was selected to play Casca at the
Shakspeare tercentenary celebration in 1916. The
most successful of contemporary London managers,
he is the most renowned producer in Europe, next
to Reinhardt, and his play “Chu-Chin-Chow” had
a continuous run of 2238 performances, the longest
on record. But Asciie’s achievements have made
him hateful to the herd that hasn’t arrived. He
has incurred the bitter enmity of actors without
engagements, dramatists with unsaleable plays, and
paragraphists with a talent for general invective;
and the public, ever ready to believe the worst of
native-born eminence, has responded in the usual
manner. So Asche goes back to Britain a soured
and disillusioned man. Present indications are that
Monash will t?y the next victim. The military
reputation of the great A.I.F. commander is, of
course, invulnerable, but he is general manager of
the Morwell (Vic.) electricity scheme, and is assail-
able on that score—or so, at least, it seems to
sensation-mongering scribes. Monash was appointed
in August, 1921, for a term of five years.
No engineer would dream of passing judg-
ment on a half-finished job. Nevertheless, it is
alleged by the muckrakers of rape-and-murder
journalism that the scheme is over-capitalised, that
the public won’t buy briquettes, that there is too
much moisture in the coal, that the current will
cost tw.ee the original estimate, and so on and so
forth. The same tactics, one recalls, were adopted
when the Westralian goldfields water-scheme was
in process of construction. In that case they were
pursued . with such malevolence, and with such wild
contempt of facts and engineering principles^— one
writer gravely predicted failure because fish had
been discovered in the dam —that the mind of the
great Irish-Australian who had planned the whole
thing, and who was carrying a burden heavy qnough
for three men, gave way under the strain. He de-
stroyed himself when success was in sight. For
20 years water has been pumped to Kalgoorlie
along a 380-mile pipeline without a day’s interrup-
tion in the supply ; but the man who wrought the
m„rvel was not spared to see it consummated, being
worried into his grave by the snarling breed of'
mongrel-minded men. Monash, no doubt, is made
of less sensitive stuff than C. Y. O’Connor. But
why, oh why, is Australia so ready to throw mud
at Australians who are doing things, or to chuckle
when mud is thrown ?
A Special Hospitals Tax.
In Westralia, as in other States, the public
hospitals are financed by Government sub-
sidies, collection-boxes and fees from in-
jatients who are presumed to be able to pay
for their board and lodging. The result
is that the equipment is generally inferior,
the accommodation is frequently inadequate,
and the staffs work long hours for low
wages. During the recent session of the
State Parliament an attempt was made to
put these chronically impecunious institu-
tions on a sounder footing. The Govern-
ment introduced a bill providing for a hospi-
tals tax of a penny in the fl, on all wages,
salary and income above £5l a year, the in-
tention being that every person in receipt of
£1 a week should pay 4s. 4d. a year; of £lO4,
Bs. Bd.; of £2OB, 17s. 4d.; of £5OO, £2 Is. Bd.;
of £lOOO, £4 3s. 4d., and so on. In con-
sideration of the impost married patients
whose income was less than £2OO p.a. were
to be exempted from maintenance fees, and
members of friendly societies were to vet a
rebate, of 25 per cent.; but with these excep-
tions it was laid down that payment of the
tax carried with it no right to free indoor
treatment. The measure vot through one
House, but encountered violent hostility in
both. Labor complained, reasonably enough,
that the exemption was fixed too low. The
main Tory objection was that those who
furnished most of the revenue would get none
of the benefits, although the same might be
said, with equal justice, of the present hap-
hazard methods of raising funds. In the
end the bill was added to the hecatomb of
slaughtered innocents, Fat being in a savage
mood owing to the Government having kept
him working in the dog days, and the chances
are that it won’t be revived this side of the
general election, which is due early next year.
But a carefully-framed hospitals tax is
worthy of a trial. Like the blessed rain
from Heaven it would fall on the just and
unjust alike. It would compel Moneygrub
to do his duty instead of loafing, as he does,
on the Great hearts of the community—and
them it would save, to some extent, from the
importunities of the collector and the hold-
up methods of the professional promoter. If
the experiment succeeded it might be so ex-
tended as to do away with the whole tribe
of charity organisers, and perhaps solve the
problem of intermediate hospitals. At all
events, the tax would enable Westralia to
rid itself of the reproach that its hospitals
are “starved of necessary equipment,” because
they are “not getting the financial aid that
modern conditions require.” Which indict-
ment has been brought against the State by
its one medico-politician, Dr. Saw.
The Gateway to Australia.
A cry from Thursday Island: —
For some yeax's the Australian pearling industry
has been completely dominated by Japanese—many
of them, vve are told, ex-naval and ex-military offi-
cers. To further their “peaceful penetration” they
keep their own counsel and show no signs of what is
underneath, although here ,and there discontent has
been manifesting itself in respect of the almighty
dollar. Now the long-looked-for ultimatum has been
presented to the Shellers’ Association. The Japs to
the number of 700-odd met at their club at 10 a.m.,
then marched four abreast to the headquarters of the
Shellers’ Association, a distance of three-quarters of
a mile. On arrival the ultimatum was presented by
one of the Jap. interpreters, who explained the posi-
tion, and at the same time requested an immediate
decision. As the shellers were caught on the hop
they sparred for time, and eventually promised a
decision the following day. This was not approved
by a great number of the Japs ; nevertheless things
passed off quietly. That evening there was much cheer-
ing, beering' and arrogance in the streets as the Japs
clattered from place to place. White women walk-
ing on the footpath were jostled and compelled to
take the road. Our only photographer, keen on get-
ting a record of the procession, was told to “get.”
Having his best camera with him he “got”—without
argument. The following afternoon another proces-
sion waited on the shelters for their promised deci-
sion. The result was a foregone conclusion. The
shellers were beaten from the start. On the decision
being announced there was more jubilation and more
beer. Now we await another ultimatum.
This island is often referred to as the Key to Aus-
tralia. Maybe it is. But who holds the key? Cer-
tainly not the whites. At the present moment there
are over 700 able-bodied Japs—every one as hard as
nails-—playing two-up, or beering up, or swaggering
through the town as if they owned it —which they
practically do. And what protection have the
whites? Our garrison consists of about 25 men of the
R.A.G.A. and one officer. The white population is
about 150. Of mixtures there are 250. No wonder
the little brown man is cheeky.
What’s going to be done? These men are no good
to Australia. They don’t spend a bean outside their
own stores ; they import even their own stagger-juice,
besides sending thousands of pounds out of the country
every few weeks. Is the industry as it stands at
present worth the risk ?

“Chip” : As far as we here know, the only
suitable place in Papua for cotton-growing
is in the Central Division, because of its
more or less regular or defined seasons: all
other places have more or less ill-defined
rainy seasons. Unfortunately, the Central
Division does not yield labor, casual or
otherwise, the native being too haughty to
work for the mere white man. Consequently
labor has to be recruited. Western Gulf or
Delta labor would in the first quarter drive
the new-chum planter dippy, or into the
dock for murder. Labor must come from
the east, if it will. A one-year boy will
cost £5 by the time he is first mustered on
the “estate.” The wages are £9 p.a. ; keep,
£l5; return home, £2. That makes him a
£3l p.a. proposition, or about Is. 3d. per
diem, Sundays included. Some figure that
a boy costs Is. 6d. per diem. The Papuan
does not like the sun, and to have to stand
in it and pick cotton might dispirit him.
I think it would. The real good pickers
would be the women and children ; but you
would not be able to get them. A few years
ago peanut seed was imported and distri-
buted among the natives. The plants throve
mightily. Yet, do you think that the natives,
for their own benefit, would dig up the
nuts and trade them? Not they! The pigs
did the rest, praising their lords from whom
all blessings flowed. While I admit that
this glimpse into native temperament does
not bear directly on cotton-growing and
picking, yet it will show that the Papuan
is most conservative, taking only to a strange
task if he is driven, and in the end perhaps
proving to be not the cheap proposition he
looked at a distance.
In Ireland things don’t happen as in other
places. De Valera, the bloodstained half-
Spaniard from New York, who has a thou-
sand murders on his hands, lately sent out
from his ambush still another set of terms.
He demanded that the past election, at which
His party was licked, securing only 36 seats
out of 128, should be annulled and a
new one held to decide the single ques-
tion whether the island shall be Dominion
or Republic. The President (the Pre-
mier is called “President” in the Free
State) says he is willing to have a referen-
dum on the subject, provided the rebels sur-
render their arms as a preliminary, which is
a remarkable concession for a majority leader
with a clearly-defined duty to his country to
offer. The arms of the rebels would doubt-
less prove, for purposes of surrender, to con-
sist chiefly of old Tower muskets, muzzle-
loaders such as the Austrians lost at
Sadowa, and pikes handed down from the
battle of Vinegar Hill. But the self-
appointed “President” in concealment
won’t surrender even these relics, all
available weapons being apparently wanted
to win the referendum with and for
the renewal of brigandage in case of
defeat. Besides, he doesn’t ask for a refer-
endum but for the dissolution of this Par-
liament and a new election. A very large
question is whether the taking of a vote either
way would imply a temporary amnesty for
all the murderers and looters and gunmen,
so that they might come out of their retire-
ment and run for election or organise the
campaign. If the popular vote gave a majo-
rity for a Republic, probably because the
majority had lost faith in the ability of the
Free State to protect anybody, a few diffi-
culties would still remain. The north-east
would object. The British Government
wouldn’t recognise the new State, and would
be more likely to blockade it. Foreign
Powers wouldn’t hunt for needless and un-
profitable trouble by recognising such a small
and apparently transient wild cat. The
great majority of the people—those who
elected the 92 anti-Republican members—
would be hostile or indifferent at heart,
though they acquiesced outwardly, nothing
having happened in recent times to make
them any more cordial. Their desire to lay
down their lives for the Republic would be
a limited quantity. It wouldn’t increase
when it was found that the Republican irre-
gulars went on making trouble, simply be-
cause they had lost the taste for spade work.
If their leader attempted to suppress them
there would always be the chance of get-
ting a more advanced programme and an-
other leader. The De Valera movement, in
fact, has become Ned Kellyism on the grand
scale. The calamity is that the Celtic soul
has a certain regard for insurrectionary
figures like De Valera and Ned Kelly
while they remain insurrectionary.
•
“Di-Haka” : I agree that the fostering of
Motuan would prove to be a boon in Papua.
It is a language which the average Euro-
pean learns with ease, while the native picks
it up with remarkable facility. At present
the prevalence of “pidgin” in both English
and native languages is the greatest obstacle
to progress. It is safe to say that m’sunder-
standings caused by this see-saw method of
speaking lead to most cases of conflict be-
tween European and native. It cannot be
contended that the native learns English
readily. The universal use of “pidgin”
proves the contrary. A native is very proud
of what English he can master. If he was
an apt pupil he would not be so ready to
lapse into “pidgin” as a refuge and his own
language as a comfort. Newcomers to Papua
are always advised by old hands of experi-
ence to learn Motuan on the ground that
it will carry one in most of the accessible
parts of the Territory, and the writer has
proved the advice to be sound. An instance
of this was given on one of the largest
plantations in the Territory, where a man-
ager who had a good knowledge of Motuan
was able to control without difficulty a large
gang of laborers recruited from Mambare,
Cape Nelson. Fergusson Island, Suau, Motu
Motu and Kiwai, all different tribes with
a language of their own, but speaking
Motuan fluently, though they had practically
no knowledge of English. The policy of the
Government in encouraging the spread of
English is sound, but progress must be slow.
The writer cannot see how it is possible
under present conditions for an official to
do good work if he complies strictly with the
rule of speaking non-pidgin English only
unless he has knowledge of a local language.
He cannot always have an interpreter by
his side.. He is changed from place to place,
and it is not possible for him to learn the
language of every district to which he goes.
If the Government recognised one native
language and. fostered its use in all districts
an officer with a grasp of that language
would find his work comparatively simple.
Motuan being the language of the natives in
the district of the seat of Government, it
can be most easily and successfully fostered.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Hughes’s grandiose schemes, in which mil-
lions were airily thrown about, have had
far-reaching consequences. Before the war
even State Treasurers were alarmed when
their borrowings reached five .millions a year.
Owe Sullivan was reckoned a shocking
spendthrift; yet in 1900-04, the quinquen-
nium in which he flourished, N. S. Wales
spent only 17-J millions of borrowed money
—hardly more than a “cautious” Treasurer
now has to provide in a year. Even municipal
councils have caught the infection, and little
bobtailed suburban bodies talk in hundred
thousands'. Of course, they don’t get value for
their money, any more than Hughes did
when he bought his 50 or 60 ships. All they
certainly do is to remove an army of men
from real productive jobs, and add enor-
mously to the difficulties of farmers and
manufacturers and other people who are try-
ing to pay their way.
Melbourne Age began the tale thus :
The picture of a frail, shrinking figure of a woman,
only a girl in years, but worn old through fear, bru-
tality and the struggle to live, and bearing marks
of savage ill-treatment, aroused compassion among
those present at the sitting of the Fitzrov court
yesterday.
She said that her husband beat her often,
that she was covered with scars and bruises,
and that the hearing of one ear had been
destroyed—and the terror-stricken little crea-
ture looked it all and more. The immediate
matter, supported by police and other evi-
dence, was that the brawny husband burst
into the house of a relative with whom his
victim had taken refuge, thus grievously
damaging the law of property, beat her
almost into insensibility, and kicked her on
the face, head and body. Also, he bashed
the owner of the house. After studying de-
fendant’s list of previous convictions (lar-
ceny, vagrancy, etc.) the J’s.P. said some
very severe things, and made it a £lO fine on
one charge and £2 on the other. The Bul-
letin has always been an opponent of the
lash, but sometimes it has doubts. The idea
of flogging honorary justices looks much less
abhorrent than it did.
The desire in Labor circles to repudiate
any present, past or possible connection with
burst-up and discredited Soviet Russia sug-
gests that it is time for the rooster to crow?
again in Pilate’s marble halls. But the
denials will not matter. For though it is
constantly explained that “the extremists”
are a mere handful who have come on top
in the Labor movement by accident, they
remain officially on top. What is gained
by an affectation of contempt for “Jock,”
if nobody can shift “Jock,” while “Jock” is
allowed to shift mountains?
Hitherto the Commonwealth has subsidised
the States, but, according to one account, the
Bruce-Page Government proposes to reverse
the policy. The Federal authority is to
cease from direct taxation so that the States
may collect double, and in return the child-
ren are to allow the parent 30s. per head
per annum pocket-money. It is wisdom to
save collection expenses, but when the parent
is stalled off for the tenth time with his
prodigal daughter’s lOU, he may wish he
had kept the business in his own hands.
Senator Borah, one of the numerous high-
brows produced in the United States, is about
to pussyfoot through Europe with a plan
for “outlawing” war, and disqualifying it,
and putting it out of court, and striking it
off the roll. It would be good practice if he
stayed at home and “outlawed” assault and
battery to get his hand in, but real high-
brows are never practical.
MR. DOOLEY DENIES THAT HE IS
SLIPPING. .
“The average Australian Labor leader is like a
man who hangs from the edge of a precipice by
the tips of his fingers."
Ex-Premier Dooley’s reply to his detrac-
tors of the Sydney A.L.P., who allege that
crookedness was employed to secure J. B.
Suttor’s appointment as a Labor Leg. Coun-
cillor, and that Dooley was privy to it, is
suffused with the geniality which is never
absent from these endless Labor feuds. It
includes these courtly sentences
The movement cannot succeed if it is to be
torn week by week by the selfish intriguing of
uncouth crooks and their hangers-0n.... The move-
ment cannot live in public estimation if the gut-
ters of the city are to be raked for creatures to
fake charges against the party’s leader.
Dooley is plucky, but it is a melancholy
fact that every comrade who has stood up
to the gentry designated as “uncouth crooks”
has had to take the count. There was once
a Labor reformer named Catts.
From the Man in the Gallery:—
Billy Hughes, last heard of beating out a bush-fire
at Sassafras, has not announced where he is going
to sit when Parliament meets. A while back some
humorist pinned his name next to the seat bespoken
by Pratten ; and probably the jester might have put him
alongside Watt, only that the seats on each side c-f
the latter on the front corner bench had already
been annexed. The Corner is likely to play a
bigger part in the debates when the House settles
down to real work in June. In addition to Pratten,
Watt and possibly Hughes there will be a strong
legal pair, Latham and Maxwell, and farmers such
as Hill and Prowse, who were overlooked when the
portfolios were handed out. Prowse has been
mollified to some extent by receiving the post of
Junior Whip, but he is still sensitive to the injus-
tice which raised the shifty Atkinson to Ministerial
rank after being about five minutes in the party.
Senator Reed, of the United States, one of
the Jefferson Bricks or Elijah Pogroms for
whom that land is famed, made a sensation
in the debate on the agreement by which
Britain is to pay Uncle Samuel £926,000,000
for the pound of flesh lent during the war.
He said the terms should have been harder,
and that as for the means of collection there
were British possessions near at hand of
which Uncle could take possession in 24
hours. Of course he had his bellicose eye
on Canada, which may be worth £920,000,000,
or part thereof, though it extends far further
north than Alaska, and further north than
most of Greenland, and bears freeze over
much of its area. But supposing Canada ob-
jected, and the Empire supported its objec-
tion ! The United States certainly licked
Mexico single-handed ; and also Spain. But
it doesn’t always happen. Russia talked
the same way to Japan, and Germany dis-
coursed in similar terms to the globe.
At the eternal business of dodging the
responsibility and pondering ponderously
the Bruce-Page Government, or at least
its Minister for Territories, isn’t the
improvement that was hoped for. An
instance is its Napoleonic way of tack-
ling the Territory problem. A meeting of
northern pastoralists was due in Melbourne.
It would deliberate about the N.T. It
would tell the Minister the result of its
ruminations. When he got over his surprise
he would tell the Cabinet, and that body,
having at last got something to go upon,
might make this news the basis of a policy.
In fact, it would tackle the “problem,” which
isn’t any “problem” at all, and never was, as
something quite fresh. The North wants
an ordinary, straight, business-like, standard-
gauge railway, so that its cool southern part
will be no more than 30, and its hot northern
part not more than 60, hours from a big
city, where there is law, order and civilisa-
tion, instead of being weeks and sometimes
months away. Then the case calls for a
Ministry, not a cackling noise, that will sell
land along the line, especially in the cool
tableland, with reasonable precautions
against the aggregation of over-large estates,
the simple reason being that the man who
has put his money into the land is fixed,
or his successor is, while the leasehold man
is a mere tent-dweller. The railway would
bring settlers to the land, and the settlers’
money could be used to help pay for the
railway. The arrangement should assist that
allegedly insatiable craving for farms, to
alleviate which Earle Page’s State alone
has spent £14,000,000 of loan money since
the war, and has already lost £5,000,000 of
it—enough to pay for 1000 miles of railway.
Among other things, the Rockhampton
(Q.) by-election convinced Tom Glasgow that
he had better remain where he is. Disgusted
at the tactics pursued by some of the anti-
Labor crowd, the A.I.F. general refuses to
resign from the Senate and lead the alleged
United party against Theodore and Co. No
one regrets the decision more than J. V.
MacDonald. MacDonald was a nominee
Senator for four months after Adamson went
over the hill. Having been fifth man on
Dec. 16, when four Nationalists were elected,
he is to have the first refusal of any vacancy
while a State Labor Government is in office,
And Glasgow was the centre of all his hopes,
The motor vehicle which lumbers through
a dozen or more municipalities in a day, and
often doesn’t pay a bean for the repair of
the roads which it wears out, is going to
make a lot of people more friendly to the
toll system than they have been. News-
papers seem to think it quite a joke that
motor vehicles are successfully competing
with the State’s trains and trams, in N. S.
Wales especially; but there is really no joke
about it —unless paying increased taxes is
a joke.
There are loud hallelujahs over the rapid
increase in Australian Savings Bank de-
posits. We have got over 175 millions saved
up and are putting by 20 millions a year.
The hallelujahs are premature. We don t
own those millions : we have borrowed them,
and have got to repay them. Commonwealth
and State liabilities together amount to 900
millions, and we are piling up debt at the
rate of about 40 millions a year. Certainly
the Savings Bank deposit, which has been
growing so nicely, nominally belongs to the
depositors; but seeing that both Common-
wealth and State taxation per head has more
than doubled in five years, while charges for
services have more than doubled in some
cases, the nominal owner would, as a rule,
be better off if he didn’t have the deposit—
provided, of course, his debts and his taxes,
etc., were back where they were even seven
years ago.
“X.0.X.”: If South Aus. feels aggrieved
over its small representation in the new
Federal Cabinet, what ought to be the feel-
ings of some of the other States when look-
ing over a few of the Governments of the
past? In the first Fisher Cabinet (1908-09)
Harwell's State held three portfolios, N.S.W.
and Westralia two, and Victoria and Banana-
land one each. In the Watson Ministry
of 1904 Victoria, again backward in the
scramble, secured one billet and Westralia
the same, while the Ma State, S. Aus, and
Q. divided the other six between tllem.
Westralia had no voice in the Ministry of
1-Premier Reid, which included, besides him-
self, two Ma Staters ; while McLean had one
other Victorian, the two remaining jobs
going to Q. and S.A. The Deacook Fusion
of 1909-10 seemed to lay the foundations
of the present “unwritten law” by allotting
three portfolios each to Vic. and N.S.W.,
two to Queensland, and one each to S.A.
and W.A. Evidently some belated recogni-
tion of the past insults to Tassy led the
Bruce-Pages to hand over the Vice-
Presidency of the Executive Council to
Atkinson.
The Bruce-Pages having decided to throw
out various war-time “ordinances,” the sign-
ing of political articles during Federal elec-
tions had better go, too. It was a small,
catty law, founded on ignorance. In the
interests of the writers a lot more articles
than are signed ought to be; but so far as
political matter is concerned, nine times out
of ten the writer doesn’t express his own
personal opinions, and as he says so when
he signs, the value of the signature
is nil. Anyway, why should the law,
if it is a good one, apply only to
election times? Whether, we have Pro-
tection or Freetrade is of more import-
ance than whether we have Smith or Jones
as a member, yet except at election times a
man may be as anonymous as he likes in his
discussion of the bigger question.
Of 7596 Diggers placed on non-irrigation
blocks in Vic. 490 have throw up their hold-
ings, and 138 are expected to do likewise.
Roughly, 8 per cent, have definitely failed.
It is thought by inspectors that the prospects
of 55 p.c7 are “good,” and those of 37 p.c.
“fair.” Minister Oman has made it clear,
in reply to the Korrumburra soldier-settlers,
that he won’t remit interest, but he under-
takes to give triers all the encouragement
he reasonably can. Wearne, the N.S.W.
Lands Minister, recently went out of his
way to praise the Victorian methods of
settlement. Which suggests that his own
State’s are too appalling for words.
Actuated by the report of Auditor-General
Norris that. the Vic. Railway Commissioners
were charging too little to revenue account
and too much to loans, the Public Accounts
Committee is turning its searchlight on the
whole subject of railway finance. Norris has
supplied details of his complaint, and the
Commissioners have been invited to reply.
The controversy is interesting in this way:
if what the Auditor-General suggests is true,
then last year’s State surplus was a myth,
and actually there was a deficit.
One P. P. Christensen, who leads an
alleged Farmer-Labor party in the U.S.A.,
has dropped into Australia with news about
the Bolshevists, who, it seems, “are proving
every day that they have every capacity for
self-government.” Judging by this remark
and other expressions of fervent sympathy
with the Reds, Christensen lacks every capa-
city for sane criticism. The visitor is a
Chicago lawyer, which suggests that his
Farmer-Laborers must be a queer lot. One
of the Sydney dailies which introduced him
to a country previously ignorant of his exist-
ence asserts that they polled 2,650,000 votes
at the presidential election. Actually they
polled 265,411 in a total of 26,786,758.
THE DEAD LIMIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
. “The Manly (N.S.W.) Council has passed a reso-
lution demanding an apology from a Sydney journal
for having referred to the aldermen as Bumbles.
There is joie de vivre a-plenty in the surfers laugh-
ing lines
And ineffable contentment ’neath the Norfolk Island
pines.
But a cloud of indignation and an atmosphere of
gloom
Hang around the city fathers in their stately council
room.
Thunderbolts of acrid comment Jovine editors may
loose,
But it’s felt there should be limits to malevolent
abuse,
Where the long Pacific wave a-foaming tumbles
And the beauty of the seascape beats The Mumbles,
You may mostly give your views
Any garnish that you choose,
But you mustn’t speak of aldermen as Bumbles.
Green the pines and gold the beaches, and beneath
the azure skies
Youth and beauty shoot the breakers —also folly as
it flies.
But the city dads of Manly sit in silence grim and
drear,
Though they’re hardened and impervious to the ordi-
nary jeer.
Most dispraise and condemnation such as long-neck’d
geese may hiss
Leaves unwrung their lusty withers, but they draw
the line at this.
Where the youngster’s sandy castle grows and
crumbles
And the deck-chair occupant for twopence fumbles,
Very few will be dismayed
If a spade is called a spade;
But don’t refer to aldermen as Bumbles.
Deem not finer feelings lacking in the hard, material
brains
That are racked about the culverts and concentre
on the drains.
Stormiest half-yearly meetings seldom leave them
narked or galled,
But one epithet’s verboten. There’s one word they
won’t be called. .
Round it cluster all the satire, all the ridicule and
shame
Ever the relentless Dickens thrust into a proper name.
Where the blue Pacific amiably rumbles
And naiads with their swains together jumbles,
There’s singularly few
Expressions are tabu,
But you never talk of aldermen as Bumbles.

Though, except under special circumstances,
the div. rate is limited to a maximum 8 p.c.
p.a., Australian Gas shares came into favor
again during the term under review. In
November 31,2(52 new £6 shares were offered
at auction, and all were knocked down at
prices ranging between £6 Gs. and £6 10s.
lhey gave £187.572 of new capital—Taking
rue total to £2,520,000 —and contributed
£7248 of premiums. Though the half’s
declared net profit was only £964 more than
the amount required for the 8 p.c. div. hap-
penings prior to the public announcement of
net earnings have to be considered. To be-
gin with, here is a comparison of revenue-
account figures for recent December terms:

Maintenance . . 123,238 137,259 160,991 175,449
Gas receipts fell off owing to the co.’s vol-
untary reduction of prices by Id. per 1009 ft.
in May and by 2d. more in August. The
accounts do not show a corresponding drop
in costs, but extra income from residuals
provided full compensation and a bit over.
The outstanding item in the comparison is
the charge for maintenance; notwithstand-
ing lower labor costs and reduced prices for
materials, the charges under this head were
£38,000-odd more last half than in the
December term of 1920. The expansion of
this item lias had a big effect on disclosed
profits; but no doubt the Gov. Gas
Examiner, who regularly reviews the affairs
of cos. controlled by the Gas Act, is giving
an eye to repairs and maintenance appro-
priations. Possibly the exceptional costs are
dim not only to the expansion of the under-
taking but also to remedying some of the
defective installations in war-time, when
inferior materials only were available.
Another factor affecting profits is the
allowance for depreciation. The Act permits
cos. to charge up to p.c. p.a. of the total
outlay on manufacturing and distribution,
provided from borrowed and share capital,
for depreciation and “special purposes.”
There have been large fluctuations in the
amounts voted and also those withdrawn
from the reserve

During the five years since the fund was
established, £468,281 has been voted to it
and £281,408 has been spent. Exceptional
expenditure has been incurred in the re-
moval of the old city works to Mortlake, but
in future, unless strikes or accidents cause
trouble —they are two contingencies provided
for in the Act —calls on the fund should be
restricted mainly to renewals. The actual
half-yearly requirements for depreciation
cannot be gauged outside the works, but
appropriations tor and expenditure from this
account promise to be interesting in future.
On the p.c. basis, annual contributions of
£144,000-odd are permissible until the 10
p.c. limit (now £412,000) is accumulated.
At present £186,813 is lying there.
Keference has been made to special cir-
cumstances under which something more
than the standard rate of div. can be paid.
The sliding scale provided in the original
Carmichael Act of 1912 still stands. That
permitted cos. to distribute an extra i p.c.
for every penny reduction in the standard
price of gas in force 12 months. When that
provision was made the standard price of
gas was only 3s. Gd. per 1000 ft. Towards
the end of 1920, when the co. last appealed
to the Court, the price was raised to ss. 9d.,
and, presumably, that is still the “standard
price.” In May next the first penny reduc-
tion will have operated for 12 months; in
August 2d. more: and another 2d. was
clipped on January 1 last. So, at the next
balance, the A.G.L. directors could add a
fraction to the div. rate in respect of the first
penny conceded. Whether they will do so
is another matter. Anyway, the “Wild Cat”
won’t gamble on the prospect. The Govern-
ment would, no doubt, lose no time in asking
the Court to bring the standard price into
line with reduced costs of production. The
co. might, however, be permitted to pay a
bit more than the standard rate of div. when
it can prove to the satisfaction of the Court
that additional profit is being made from
improved retorting practice or from the
development of its residual side-lines. Other-
wise no incentive is offered for the co. to
produce gas and by-products on an economic
basis.

Ihis is not a talkative co., but its accounts
speak eloquently of the troubles of the cattle-
man during the past two years. After the
final distribution for the 1919 financial year
the Q. N. Pastoral showed £98,261 of re-,
serves: since then the prefs. have received
[heir 7 p.c. p.a. regularly, but ordinaries have
had only one div. of 8 p.c. Meanwhile, re-
serves have dwindled to £1505. Though the
proceeds from sale of stock, wool, etc., con-
tributed £185,652 and £158.209 for the past
two years, only £4454 of profit resulted,
llmt was after allowing for shrinkage of
stock values. Provision had also to be made
for depreciation of leaseholds and plant, and
£39,8 i 8 was struck off their book value.
Assuming that no more than was necessary
was written off fixed and floating assets, the
past two years resulted in a loss of £35,000-
odd, apart from div. distributions. No tally
of hooves is given, but valuations of live-
stock have declined in this way:—
„ 1920. 1921. - 1922.

Sheep . . . . 100,215 100,885 94 121
Horses . . . . 35,002 25,410 25,992
Had the market for wool not been favorable,
the co. would have had a disastrous run.
In other respects the pastoral industry is
still depressed ; but the future of this Co. de-
pends largely on how the reduced valuations
of stock compare with marketings. It is a
business in which results should be gauged
by _ averaging earnings over a long period.
This is the co. which took over properties
which had fallen into the hands of the Q. N.
Bank after the big smash, and directors of
the bank still figure prominently in its
Board-room. The presence of cautious bank-
ers there should be a guarantee that full;
attention is given to amortisation of leag'es
and other depreciation.
Though the co. has experienced a coid
spell, its affairs are comfortable enough:—

Against that were livestock, wool, book debts
etc., written down to £539,084. There are
a quarter-million of prefs., and they also
were fully covered by liquid assets.’ The
£600,000 of ordinary capital had the backing
of £222,037 of liquid assets, £68.695 of free-
holds, leases and improvements with a book
value of £248,353, and £81,105 of plant and

For the two years ended December 31 the
Commonwealth Life gathered £20,259 of pre-
miums, rents and interest, and spent £09,204
in doing it. That expenditure included
£11,974 of brokerage and commissions on
sale of shares, and the cost of establishment
in N. S. Wales, Vie. and S. Aus. The man-
agement has made no attempt to hide the
heavy cost of early operations, and, instead
of opening up the familiar “organisation” or
“extension of business” account, all expenses
are charged up in the revenue account.
There is now a debit of £43,100 there, and,
including £5OOO paid for goodwill, that
means that, besides the whole of the pre-
mium income having gone, £48,100 of the
£00,009 of capital has no backing. The
£17,843 of funds intact are made up in this
way:

£17,843
At present there are net tangible assets for
approximately £lO,OOO to represent capital
and to back the liability under policies.
There is also £99,193 more callable from
shareholders, but uncalled capital is not a
dependable security. The extent of the lia-
bility under policies at the balancing date is
not ascertainable : so far the society has not
undertaken a valuation of policies.
In its first year the Commonwealth Life
wrote 3142 policies assuring £199,070; last
year, 10,854 for £1,000,671 and giving an
annual premium income of £31,556. The
management declares that it has been pro-
ceeding cautiously in the matter of risks and
that lapses have been small. The society has
still a long way to go before any definite
prospects of success can become visible. With
expenses of management alone taking
£18,277, a very much larger business is re-
ouired to produce underwriting surpluses.
The future depends on : I'D the cost of the
necessary new business ; (2) whether existing
policy-holders keep their policies alive, and
(3) the claims experience. The first two
factors are still in doubt. And when revenue
does overtake expenditure, before policy-
holders or shareholders can expect distribut-
able profits, surpluses will be required to
extinguish a big deficit and to provide
adequate assurance funds.

This'co. has been in business 11 years, but
only came under the investors’ eye when
8000 7i p.c. £1 prefs. were got in to help its
expansion. Ordinary capital is £22,000,
£l5OO of which is still represented by good-
will. That goodwill accounts for the deficit
of £l2B shown in the tabl(*; though the in-
tangible asset is not large—actually it was
written down £1377 by taking credit for por-
tion of the appreciation of the worth of
leasehold property as ascertained by reliable
valuers —the co. has so far accumulated only
£1372 of reserves. During the past two
years every penny shown to have been earned
has been taken by the ordinaries’ 10 p.c.
distributions. Considering - the difficulties of
the period the management did well to earn
that rate of div.: as in most other busi-
nesses hi eh costs pressed heavily and stock
values fell; and during the past year selling
prices all-round receded an average of 121
p.c. The co. is comfortable enough. Apart
from a £6OOO mortgage, at December 31
only £647 of liabilities were on the books.

Stocks are larger than at any other time:
the management bought heavily in the low
metal markets, and is now “in a very strong
position as regards essential stocks.” A
feature of the co. is that £18,373 of its
funds is fn the five-storev premises leased
from the City Council. They have so far
proved a good letting proposition. To pro-
vide for lease depreciation the directors took
out a policy with the A.M.P. Society which
will give £5OOO after 20 years for the pay-
ment of £172 Is. Bd. p.a." On the Board of
1941 will fall the responsibility of putting
this £5OOO to work so that funds outlayed on
the property will be intact when the lease
expires 20 years later.

This old co. has not made the recovery which
might have been expected of it. During the
past year manufacturing and distributing
were “well maintained,” but visible profits
were sufficient to give only 7 p.c. That is
a poor rate of div. nowadays, particularly
in a concern like Mitchell’s, in which there
are no goodwill shares. Profits for the
year disclosed by the accounts amounted
to £18,107, but in the introductory table
£1689 of reserves which disappeared have
been deducted. That disappearance was
evidently income-tax payment in respect of
the previous financial year. The present
£27,604 of reserves are liable to similar
deductions, the year’s carry-forward having
been dropped into an income-tax account. One
feature of the co.’s recent operations has
been that it got through the period of
slumped prices without incurring heavy loss,
though considering the large volume of
stocks necessary for the business trouble
might easily have been experienced through
world’s prices crashing and exchange being
erratic. Present profits compared with
those of. a few years ago must also be con-
sidered in relation to additional capital in
the business. Established in the ’sixties,
the public became interested in 1913, when
£lOO,OOO of new capital was put in. Dur-
ing the period covered by the table £77,814
more has been contributed. Profits in 1917
gave a return of 7.1 p.c. on total funds;
last year, 6.5 p.c. After paying average
divs. of 7.6 p.c. for the past four years,
visible reserves have declined a few pounds.
During the past 12 months £25,000 net
went into properties, and the Co. now owns
the whole of the city block it occupies.
Meanwhile there has been an all-round ex-
pansion of balance-sheet figures:—-

At December 31 both stocks and book debts
were larger than during the period of abnor-
mally high values. Consequently, notwith-
standing the new capital, liabilities are
larger than at any other time. But except
for the £52,207 in property and plant, assets
are all liquid, and £198,561 owing had the
backing of £398,000-odd of stocks, book debts
and cash.

have held good and stocks are taken con-

Slate cos. The former was floated towards
the end of 1921 to “develop the tremendous
bodies of slate now opened up,” and which
were declared to have “proved of first-
class quality.” The deposits are about 12
miles south-west of Mudgee, and though good
slate has actually been proved, three cos.
have discovered that the workable material
is limited in quantity and that wastage is
very great. So far there has been no output.
As in many other mining ventures, a mistake
appears to have been made in installing ex-
pensive plants before proving the commer-
cial value of the properties. The local de-
mand for roofing slate is keen, and the sell-
ing price high enough to stand more than
the average waste —about 97 p.c. in many of
the world’s quarries. Unless large deposits
are proved at Mudgee, the quantity suitable
for the market will be negligible and costs
prohibitive.
The mining revival at Lucknow (N.S.W.)
is still going strong so far as prospecting is
concerned, but difficulties and delays in locat-
ing bonanzas have occurred, just as they did
on the old field. The elusive joint appears to
be just as difficult to locate in the new
ground, and many false scents have been
followed. Warnford Lock spent many thou-
sands of pounds in fruitless prospecting, but
he was well rewarded when the ore shoots
ivere struck. Lucknow Pups now appears to
be on the joint, but it has not yet encoun-
tered the necessary feeding spur. This co.
has plenty of virgin ground to prospect, and
it has good hopes of meeting an ore-body.
South Lucknow has been following spurs at
the 125 ft. level and meeting small makes of
good ore, but has not yet reached their con-
tact with the joint. A crosscut off one spur
lias now apparently proved the joint, which
has developed a pronounced bay and swings
parallel to the level. Ore bodies already ex-
posed are likely to yield a fair tonnage of
2oz. to 3oz. stone. The present shaft can
be sunk another 100 ft., and to play for
safety this should be done on the underlay
of the spur proved in the well-hole, which
has 3ft. of stone worth according to
the bulk sample of 6 tons. 16cwt. recently
treated. Whether that ore-body is continu-
ous and values persist is for future work to
show. South Lucknow Extended appears to
have been more fortunate in its prospecting
for the joint; its crosscut at the 100 ft. level
penetrated only about 6ft. of diorite to reach
the serpentine. The contact contains lode-
stuff with calcite and native copper, yield-
ing good gold prospects by panning. No
time will now be lost in driving along the
joint, and on present indications a spur
feeder should not be far off. Other ventures
along the assumed strike of the joint are
shaft-sinking, but have yet to locate the con-
tact and the necessary spur-feeders.
After spending some thousands in testing
all classes of mining properties submitted
under option, Vegetable" Creek (N.S.W.) has
decided to take over the Wild Cherry lode-
tin show at Ardlethan. Extensive boring at
the Emmaville mine has failed to locate a
continuation of the deep-lead from which the
co. earned big profits, and it is probable that
the mine will be abandoned. It is unreason-
able to suppose that the tin deposits ended
in the last huge pothole that was worked,
and should tin maintain a good price it is
certain that other people will do further
bore-prospecting.
Grampian Hills, Emmaville (N.S.W.), a
reconstruction of Carr’s Creek co., has
started sluicing at the tail-end of the talus
on Bailey’s section. Two lOin. pumps have
been compounded on separate driving power
for the nozzle, and this should give the high
pressure which will be necessary for anything
like effective work in some of the hard faces.
The ground is very rich in patches, and an
occasional sensational return may be looked
for. The show is to be worked on tribute.
Great Britain, Emmaville (N.S.W.), has
declared its 88th div. of Is. It is now operat-
ing on the “back” creek close to the village,
and is getting better values, in bulk, than it
has hitherto had on its extensive holding.
Tributors who worked for a long period on
very low earnings are now being well re-
warded for their patience.
A bore to test the Bulli coal-seam in its
westerly extension has recently been com-
pleted near Douglas Park, on the main
southern railway, 45 miles from Sydney.
This bore is about three miles from Appin,
where in 1914 Coal, Ltd., proved the Bulli
seam to be Bft. 3in. thick, and of excellent
quality, at 1614 ft. Owing to various rea-
sons, one of which was the cost of railway
connection to the State system, which neces-
sitated a bridge over the Nepean River, the
project was not gone on with. The Douglas
Park bore reached the Bulli seam at about
1690 ft., and proved it to be Bft. lOin. thick.
Quality is equal to the best worked on the
South Coast. Proximity to the State rail-
ways offers favorable conditions for hand-
ling the fuel when won. Those interested
are making certain of a large workable area
by putting down a second bore three miles
further north. This proving should cause
the Southern colliery-owners to sit up and
take notice: many of their working faces are
now three to four miles from daylight, adding
greatly to working costs.

Westralia’s huge manganese deposits near
Peak Hill have been measured up by the
State mining-engineer to be worth 10 mil-
lions. U.S. interests have an eye on the
deposit, and it is likely that an expert will
soon arrive to investigate.^
Edna May Deeps, which at 450 ft. received
the underlie of the Edna May reef, has de-
clared Is. div. on 100,000 shares, and 2s.
more may be distributed after sale of assets.
Deeps paid a few divs., the most impressive
from the bears’ viewpoint being the first,
which was paid out of proceeds of the sale
of reserve shares. The mine has not been a
good div.-payer, but, as a gambling counter,
it has been excellent. Had the Edna May
co., when it had the chance, secured Deeps
for £BOOO, that co.’s shareholders might have
pouched another £lOO,OOO. The manner in
which members of the various Melbourne
Boards mulled the Westonia water problem
is one of the tragedies of Westralian mining.
Ives’ Proprietary, North West, Golden
Butterfly, Mararoa cos. and others pegged,
and in some cases bought, blocks around
Mutooroo’s latest option acquisition on the
Trans, railway, 37 miles from Kalgoorlie.
John Warwick, underground-manager of Gt.
Boulder and consulting-engineer to Ives’ and
Mararoa, now reports that on Ives’ block
a trench is giving values up to 2dwt., which
is about the average so far disclosed on the
majority of blocks outside the Mutooroo
area. On present evidence the centre looks
like becoming a one-mine field, with the
one mine not a very good^one.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is now breaking
425. ore at 3020 ft. Recent good develop-
ments at depth in the ’Shoe ; Ivanhoe, Great
Boulder and South Ivalgurli have prolonged
the life of Kalgoorlie as a goldfield. While
the mines referred to are behaving well at
depth, tributors in Perseverance are winning
rich rewards..
When the Fenian, Meekatharra (W.A.),
was handed over to tributors last year, it
was expected that good results would be
obtained. During December and January
they won 9500 z. from 1600 tons.
Brown’s Reward (W.A.), after its recent
satisfactory crushing, is becoming anxious
about finance. The vendor has a claim to
portion of the proceeds of the yield, so the
co. will either have to dispose of more re-
serve shares or make calls. Cash in hand
amounts to only a few hundreds. Wages
cannot be paid from high assays and pro-
mises of early divs.
Perth Empire Syndicate has secured some-
thing unusually good in surface shows in
the leases at Sandstone. .A substantial par-
cel of 2000 tons is now being milled and a
return of £lO,OOO is expected. The actual
width of the lode has not yet been ascer-
tained, but the 2000 tons from workings
down only 15ft. suggest good measurements.
Should crushing support official assay records,
the mine will be easily the best surface show
in Westralia.
Retaliation Junction (W.A.) is to be
wound up, and any surplus is to go to con-
tributing shareholders only. Under the rules
of some of the Stock Exchanges this distinc-
tion in favor of contribs. would not be
allowed —that is, if the scrip were submitted
for inclusion in the “official list.”
Bendigo Al—it embraces the old New
Moon mine (£371,728 divs. on a called-up
capital of £11,560) and the Clarence (divs.
£138,937, calls £38.926) —presents a most
discouraging report for the half-year to Dec.
31. Directors state that “patches” in the
1043, 1142 and 1241 ft. levels (Npw Moon)
have shown values, but “no quantity of ore
of a permanent payable nature has been
developed.” The working loss for the period
was £2007. Capital being _ exhausted, the
directors are seeking the opinions of share-
holders as to the desirability of increasing
it before calling the necessary meetings—
which is about as direct an invitation to
shut up as could be given. The Clarence
mine, one of Bendigo’s biggest disappoint-
ments, seems to have been abandoned, and
at the New Moon the work done has been
mere pottering at shallow levels. Tile co.
owes the Government £11,050, but the State
has first call on plant with a book value of
about £6OOO. An improvement in the value
of shares during the past few days may be
indicative of what are considered improved
prospects, but at present working levels these
can be temporary only. An independent offi-
cial report states that “probably no mine on
the field has been so exhaustively worked
between the surface and 1538 ft. as the New
Moon. Operations at these depths have left
very little stone untested.” As to the Clar-
ence, the same report states: “Between the
1.676 ft. and 3274 ft. levels the driving done
does not exceed 120(Kt. and practically the
whole was along the payable reef at 2273 ft.”
Any hope the co. ever had must have been
in the deeper ground at both mines, and
assuming that the £30,000 already spent
has been mostly applied in testing that
ground, further effort does not appear to be
warranted.
New Blue, Bendigo, during the half-year
ended January 31, crushed 16,007 tons for
10,7770 z., an average of 13dwt. llgr. Divs.
totalling Bs. (£18,000) were distributed. Since
the balance 3s. more has been paid. The d .rec-
tors declare that the “resources of the mine are
of great magnitude,” and may “reasonably
be expected to provide profitable employment
for years to come.” Consideration is being
given to the question of erecting a 30-head
battery; to purchase and re-erect the
splendid plant of the old Catherine Reef Co.
is estimated to cost up to £lO,OOO. The pre-
sent cost of carting and crushing at the pubic
battery, adjacent to the mine, is ss. lid.
per ton; with the Catherine plant the cost
for crushing would be about 4s. 4d. per ton
with steam power, and 3s. Bd. per ton with
suction-gas power. The capacity of the 30
stampers would be 850 tons, and of 25 stamp-
ers 700 tons per week ; the present average
output is 650 tons per week, but this can
be increased. Roughly, the saving on pre-
sent output would be £5O per week, or a
trifle over £2200 per working year; in other
words, it would take the battery nearly five
years to pay for itself. Admitting the “great
magnitude” of the mine’s resources, it would
be extreme optimism to suggest that it has
five years’ life at present rate of production.
It would appear wiser to await further sat's-
factory developments at deeper levels before
approving of heavy expenditure on plant, par-
ticularly as present treatment charges are
not excessive.
* * * *
The satisfactory developments in the
Ulster mine at the 1600 ft. level, particularly
in the northern drive, have induced Bendigo
Amalgamated to float another “pup,” the
North Ulster, which will be in 60,000 shares,
of which 10,000 fully-paids will be retained
by the B.A.G. The area includes the old
Londonderry, whose shaft is deep enough for
work in quest of the Ulster formation.
* * * *
On the zone theory, Monument Hill, one of
Bendigo Amalgamated’s pups, ought to be
good goods; but it isn’t. There is quartz in
plenty, but gold is absent so far. Hercules
is a good old has-been of the B.A.G. stable.
On the Sheepshead line, it was opened up a
good deal between 1320 and 1520 feet by
levels, rises and winzes. Work until lately
was mostly south at 1320 and 1380 feet.
Here a massive formation carries enough
gold to keep the drills tapping steadily. But
crushings persist at about 7dwt., which won’t
pay with costs at present level. A recent
yield was OfHoz. from 167 tons. The market
bucked on the news, but it was only a spasm,
because the next firing disclosed that the
patch had been shot out. To test the reef
north of the shaft work has been carried on
at 1520 ft., and a trial lot of 35 loads gave
Coupled with the news that gold
had been got at the top of the level, the show
had the appearance of a revived giant. Again
it was only a thrill, for the gold cut out at
the top and went underfoot at the bottom of
the level.
Forty years ago Allendale (Vic.) was pro-
minent on the alluvial landscape. The old
Riston, for instance, won £200,400 of divs.
and paid £32,300 royalties, and others on the
lead were steady div.-payers. In 1914.
when Vic. gold-mining showed signs of
petering out rapidly, the Mines Department
put down a number of trial bores in different
localities in the hope of stimulating enter-
prise. Two holes at Allendale indicated the
existence of a new lead which was thought
to be a tributary of that worked by the Ris-
torj. One of the bores struck a water flow of
6000 gallons per hour ; nevertheless, about 12
months ago, the New Ristori was formed to
test the lead. A neat little plant has been
installed, work is now down nearly 200 ft.,
"nd so far water has been kept under control.
Values have not been sighted yet, but the
country for miles around has been pegged
in anticipation.
From a Melbourne laboratory:—
A light yellow oil of paraffin base has been found
under a deposit of salt and gypsum in the north
of South Aus. The oil seems to have been created
where it lies in a basin filled under marine condi-
tions when it was an estuary long ago. It remains
to be proved whether or not oil exists in payable
quantities.
Associated Oil, Mt. Gambier (S.A.), is
down 1330 ft., and the summing-up of direc-
tors in their latest report is that “sufficient
evidence has not yet been obtained from the
bore to justify any definite statement as to
the possible depth we may have to drill, or
the anticipation of results; but nothing so
far has been encountered detrimental to the
prospects of finding oil.” When Californian
driller Roy Fife took over bore operations in
September the Corp. had got down 351 ft. in
seven months at a boring cost of £lO 15s.
per ft.; Fife pushed down 979 ft. at 295.. 6d.
per ft. To save expense and delay, the direc-
tors propose to put' down trial holes on other
sections of the co.’s properties to ascertain
the most likely spots for boring. Shareholders
are invited to take up 10,000 new £1 shares
to finance this work.
Morry’s oil area at Woolston, near Bris-
bane, has been unfavorably reported on by
Geologist St. Smith. Geological features
and composition of coals, etc., are against it,
although a little oil was obtained from
samples of sludge which be thinks is a slight
seepage of natural rock oil into the bore.
Already £4OOO has gone into it. The bore
was down about 650 ft., and there has been
the same old story of water never having
been properly shut off. and any likely beds —
although St. Smith doesn’t think there are
any——would be flooded under these condi-
tions. .
Sardine North is still pegging along with-
out striking any purple patches. Prospect-
ing work is under way in a winze from the
161 ft. level and the footwall crosscut off the
same level. A trial crushing of 10 tons
has just been taken out of this level, but
the formation is very irregular in size and
values, and the continuations of the good
shoots of its neighbor are still to be found.

“Harold II.” introduces The Great Lover:
Before the age of discretion is reached there is
naturally an age of indiscretion, and an 18-year-old
lad of Balmain is making the most, of it. His
escapades hardly received full publicity till his
father proceeded against the youngster for the theft
of some money which he “borrowed” the last time
he eloped. Dad explained that he wanted the boy
either to receive a lesson that would curb his
exuberance or to be placed under restraint. The
youth is a hefty young fellow, and it is alleged
against him that he has made a hobby of running
away with girls. The father explained that nothing
more than romanticism was charged against Borneo,
but some of his best friends had been naturally
annoyed at their daughters being involved in his
premature yearnings for a soul-mate. The boy

planned his first elopement when he was 13, and
with a sweetheart of a year younger was taken
into safe-keeping by the fatherly captain of a
coastal boat. Subsequently there have been six
similar episodes. The youngster admitted that he
had saturated himself with romantic literature;
and the beak let him off with a warning that had
a pointed reference to gaol in it.
“Alpha”: A firm of Melbourne solicitors
is wondering what is going to happen next.
Recently it defended a law-suit on behalf of a
wealthy and highly irascible client, and had
the satisfaction of pulling off the case, with
Costs against the plaintiff. The latter promptly
covered up all trace of his business assets,
wherefore an indignant defendant instructed
the legal firm to distrain on his furni-
ture. They prepared the writ and handed
it to a bailiff, who merely noted the defen-
dant’s address without ascertaining against
whom the execution was directed. In 09
cases out of 100 the defendant is the object
of the Law’s gentle attentions, and the
bailiff consequently repaired to the residence
of the successful litigant, broke in on him
while he was entertaining some pet cronies
and seized a rare old Chippendale suite, the
outraged householder is threatening all sorts
of writs against those responsible for the
blunder; and the members of the law hrm
have suddenly found that golf is much more
attractive than their office.* #
“L.E.”: At one time some of us used to
pride ourselves on our supposed Celtic strain,
especially the Scots and
Irish. Everything that
was brilliantly intellec-
tual or artistic was
claimed as Celtic. The
beer-drinking and bacon-
eating Saxon was too
dull and sluggish to pro-
duce art or poetry. Now
the modern science of
anthropology does away
with this old-fashioned
feud between Celt and
Saxon. Experts say that
this racial division has
no meaning. We find
now that we are Nords
or Mediterraneans. A
young Australian scient-
ist, Dr. “Possum” Wool-
lard, who is now lectur-
in g and making re-
searches in the Univer-
sity of London, used to
embarrass his friends by
examining their com-
plexions, eyes and hair
in order to assess their
exact proportions of Nord
and Mediterranean. Most
people are mixtures; but
it was good to have a
white skin, blue eyes and
fair hair (red hair was
especially desirable)
which proved you be-
longed to the superior
Nordic race. The little
dark person, with his swarthy skin and
black hair, a Mediterranean, a miserable
pleb, had to hide his shame in a corner.
“No Name”: The Bonar Law Govern-
ment has proved a good friend to Bull’s
war pensioners. For instance, I got tired
of weighing out half-guineas to doctors every
time my lung broke bounds, so, acting on
advice, I communicated with the British
Ministry of Pensions. By a recent mail I
was notified that an extra ten bob a week,
“constant-attendance” allowance, would be
mine in .future. The rise doesn’t make me
a millionaire; all the same, I can afford to
let The Bulletin have this par. for no-
thing. It’s my tribute to the only nation
in Christendom that pays its debts.

“F. Clinton”: The old-time surveyors in
the Ma State had some weird notions of
nomenclature. Between the
Italian Antonio and the
aboriginal Yurdyilla the
first and last parishes on
the official list —are nearly
5000 names. Perhaps the
commonest are those like
Bald Nob or Hanging Rock,
inspired by prominent fea-
tures of the landscape.
Silent Grove, The Willows
and Swanbrook are rather
pretty, which is more than
can be said of Tacklebang,
Wog Wog, Yang Yang,
Ironmungy and Mucca
Mucca. The 'abo. language
provides numerous tongue-
twisters, such as Nuren-
merenmong, Gidgingidinbung
and Currabunganung, while
at the other end of the scale
are such sweetly simple
names as Meit, Mia Mia and
Gil Gil. Duplication is
common. There are eight
Russells, five Oxleys and
no less than nine Myalls.
About the most originally-
named of the lot is Jingle-
money. In the Far West
there is a selection called Bit Late. “Yairs,”
the owner said to the Land Board, “I only
got in when the early birds had picked out
the eyes of the country.”

“Gaza”: “Like his impertinence,” gasped
my neighbor in the tram, more to herself

between the two tickets just given to her

my own?” she started, as soon as his cap’s

damages inflicted on an unwary pedestrian
not only helped to oust the politician con-
cerned—his opponent in Grey (S.A.) widely
advertised the affair —but it gave Bruce a
good pretext to ban joy-riding by Ministers’
female and infant belongings, and at the
same tune scrap five of the Federal fleet of
vehicles. Eight cars are now under the con-
trol of Defence Minister Bowden at Vic-
toria Barracks, and seeing that Bruce in-
variably uses his own, the allowance for
“official” journeys by his colleagues is still
well on the liberal side. But it is doubtful
whether Bruce will be able to eliminate joy-
riding entirely. Opportunities for carting
relations or “friends” on allegedly “official”
jaunts will readily occur to Ministers who
are looking for entertainment at Australia’s
expense. And, despite assertions to the con-
trary, there is as yet no proof that the new
men are any more adamant than those they
displaced.
“P.X.”: At Nice, in the South of France,
the other day I went to the market —every-
body else in the town seemed to be also
going—bought a dozen figs for 3d., and saw
cauliflowers eight inches wide sold for three-'
ha’pence. There were stalls up and down
for half-a-mile —four or more rows of them :
stalls laden with fruits and flowers and
vegetables, among the flowers more wattle
than was ever seen in an Australian market
in one day ; yet on the whole not very well
grown flowers, and nothing at all remark-
able in vegetables either. But all Nice goes
to the market; any housewife who doesn’t
feel equal to humping home her own pota-
toes —though none of t-hem would think it
any more beneath their dignity to carry
their own vegetables than their own hand-
kerchiefs—can hire a woman norter for a
few centimes. There is no howling or bellow-
ing in the market: the vendor, who is about
half the time a woman, may, as you pass,
confidentially draw your attention to the
exceeding magnificence of her wares, but the
whole market doesn’t make half the racket
of a single Australian street-barrow. Nice
gets its fruits and flowers and vegetables for
about one-third of what the average Austra-
lian housewife pays, and gets them fresh' —
the market is open everv morning—and, cbn-
sidering the poor soil which most of them
work, the growers are nrosperous. Biit —
and this seems to be the most important
factor —there are hardly any fruit and
vegetable shops in Nice: beautiful flower-
a’mns there are. but they deal in arranged
blooms and things out of season. There
sppmcs to be a hint concealed somewhere in
this. It may be that in the multiplicity of
Dago and other shops lies the chief reason
why the Australian table doesn t have halt
the fruit and vegetables it should have; also
why the Australian fruit and vegetable
grower mostly starves. A large Australian
capital would, of course, need more than
one market if some municipal Caesar tnea
the bold experiment of abolishing fruit and
vegetable shops. Also Australia would have
to get out of its absurd habit of thinking it
beneath its dignity to carry hny parcm
larger than a face-powder box. No otnei
people in the world have this uppish habit
to the same extent. #
“F. Clinton’s” condensed novelette: —
Fate is a grim jester. About 25 years ago a
Sydney man of my > acquaintance was divorced by
his wife for transferring his attentions to the maid.
There were no children. He subsequently man ied
the lady in the case, and his erstwhile wife soon
afterwards found a new mate. Both unions proved
fruitful, the only child of the first being a girl,
and the eldest child of the second a son. Presently
a shadow, ; felL on the girl’s family. She was in
trouble—the old, old trouble. The lad with whom
she had been keeping company was called in, and
agreed to marry her. Being under age, however,
he required his parents’ consent, and they naturally
enough expressed a wish to meet the girl’s parents.
They did, but there was a tense silence when the
girl’s father and mother and the boy’s mother recog-
nised each other as the principals in the divorce
proceedings of years previous. They kept their
secret well, however, and the marriage bells duly
tinkled.
“Tin Hat” : Almost every morning now I
read that someone has succeeded (or hasn’t)
in breaking the or
Melbourne-to-Sydney motor record. What
good are these broken records, anyway?
For the sake of a brief notoriety the breaker
turns himself into a deadly peril to everyone
along the road he travels. Latest speed records
average almost 40, and, in parts, reach 60
m.p.h.; and as the best sections of the road
are invariably those close to the townships,
the local speed regulations are simply ignored.
It is only a matter of time when one of the
hogs will go roaring down a hill at 60 m.p.h.
just as a country school empties its young-
sters across the road. Meanwhile, both tra-
velling and grazing stock are harried, and
the curse of the countryside follows the flying
wheels. Haven’t the Automobile Clubs suffi-
cient, nous to see that these stunts are build-
ing up for ordinary motorists an unpopu-
larity from which they are all liable to suffer?
“Alkaloid” on surgical operations and the
law: —
“Stellsby” , asks (B. 15/2/’23) whether it is usual
in Australian hospitals to obtain the patient’s con-
sent before an operation. However necessary such
operation may appear to the doctor, the acquiescence
of the sufferer is universally accepted as a neces-
sary preliminary. Of course, circumstances may
arise in which these preliminaries are dispensed with
— i.e., in cases of extreme urgency or when any
delay would be fatal, and the patient is not in a
condition to give consent. It might be better,
but it would presumably be regarded as an in-
terference with human liberty, if the surgeon were
the absolute arbiter in these matters. So unyield-
ing is the law that a minor may not even be
anaesthetised without the expressed consent of his
guardians.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The good little Diggers are busy to-day,
Foolin’ with brasso and bianco;
For our Mr. Birdwood is riding this way,
And ’e likes ’is brasso and bianco.
Us clean little sodjers will stand in a row,
While gorgeous orfficers strut to and. fro,
And maybe we’ll give ’em a cheer when they go,
So lay on the brasso and bianco.
The good little Diggers are snug in the line,
Away from the brasso and bianco;
And none gives a damn if yer boots need a shine —
To ’ell with the brasso and bianco!
When the stars is a-twinkle we’re out on patrol,
But with Sol in the saddle it’s “toad-in-a-’ole,”
Though bullets may whine like a motherless foal;
We don’t want no brasso or bianco; ■
The good little Diggers is chewin’ their fags,
Thd guns singin’ “brasso” and “bianco” ;
Jet black is the night, and we’re ’oppin’ the bags,
Without any brasso and bianco.
We squelch through the mud in a hail-storm of lead,
And a qyclone of shells —’ow we wish we was dead,
Or over in Blighty a-swingin’ the lead,
And sweatin’ with brasso and bianco.

“Digger’s Batman” : Re the Diggers’ gift
of smelling out good liquor (B. 22/2/’23).
When we were in a front-line possie at
Meteren it was noticed that Jim Martin had
gone missing. The worst construction was
placed upon his absence, until in the middle
of the lazy summer afternoon the lost sheep
appeared, very drunk, on the parados, and,
standing in the full glare of the sunlight, in-
vited the whole platoon to come back and
carouse with him. Not a shot was fired at
him, which may have been pure drunks’
luck. Or was Jim just the Huns’ catspaw
in a diabolical plot? That night, when the
boys were wandering back in twos and threes
to get their helping of wine from the cellar
of the shell-ruined estaminet that Jim had
discovered to the rear of us, and just before
the H.Q.’s detail told off to smash up the
supply arrived, a shell landed right in that
cellar, and did all the work that was neces-
sary. Miraculously enough, not a man was
hurt: the place happened to be momentarily
empty. But the Hun, who had only recently
been over that ground, may have thought that
a full wine-cellar would be a good trap for
A.1.F.-ers.
“Harold Hardupp”: Fate is a queer fish.
A surfer who was injured by a “dumper”
■whilst bathing on a Newcastle beach the
other day is an ex-sailorman who was many
years roving the oceans before marrying an
Australian girl and settling down to a shore
job. He was in two wrecks, one fire at
sea and a torpedoing episode during the war;
and he came through all without as much
as a cold. The surf-bathing incident has
sent him to hospital with severe injuries.
THE LIFE-LINE—CUPID UP TO DATE.
“Andy”: Having rather diplomatically re-
strained the successful petitioner in a recent
divorce case from flattening out the co-re., I
suggested an adjournment to the nearest bar.
Over the return pint he justified his aggres-
siveness. “It’s not the woman I’m worrying
about,” he confided, drawing strenously at his
Capstan—“he can blanky well have her.
What made me lose my block was the
blankard’s gall when he comes up to me and
says that now I’ve as good as proved him to
be the kid’s father, the best thing I can do
is to hand him the baby bonus. That did it.”

“Timothy” puts in a word for a much-
walloped joss:—
Give Hughes his due; if he was an utterly un-
constitutional dictator, there was often benevolence
in his despotism. And mostly promptness of action
went with it. 1 remember one occasion when
he exercised the royal prerogative of mercy off
his own bat. He had just returned to Aussie after
squaring up all affairs of the belligerent nations at
the 1919 Peace Conference. The writer, knowing
that Billy was always ready to do a returned soldier

a good turn when it didn’t cost him anything, and
further relying upon the imminence of the Federal
elections, ventured to telegraph him upon his land-
ing in Melbourne appealing for clemency on behalf
of a Digger held as a military prisoner in Bris-
bane gaol for months after most other military
delinquents had been pardoned. King William
wired back within a few hours an order for re-
lease, and the man was freed. A fortnight later,
Secretary Deane, of the Department of the Prime
Minister of the Commonwealth, wrote to say that
“the Government could not see its way clear to
grant the prisoner any remission of sentence.” AVe
left it at that. I didn’t care whether there was a
remission of sentence or not so long as my man
wasn’t serving it.

“S. Q. Lapius”: “X2X” suggests that it
is a moot question whether the lenrosy men-
tioned in the Scriptures wasn’t really
syphilis (B. 8/2/’23). The evidence against
the assumption is overwhelming. Basing
their arguments on some obscure osseous
lesions found during archaeological excava-
tions in Asia Minor, some German patholo-
gists have hazarded the opinion that the
Red Plague had its origin in Asia. If the
scourae was well known in 1000 8.C., Pales-
tine would, in the absence of specific treat-
ment such as mercury and the neo-salvarsan
preparations, have rapidly become a hot-
bed of infection; sc that with the advent of
the ardent Crusaders the disease would soon
have been propagated throughout Europe.
Yet there is no evidence of European infec-
tion before the 15th century. On the other
hand, there is plenty of evidence that it was
rife centuries ago in America, that many
sailors under Columbus contracted it and in-
troduced it into Naples, whence it spread like
wildfire through Europe. Shortly afterwards
the signs, symptomatology and clinical mani-
festations of this new disease were described
by the physicians of those days; and some
copies of these remarkably accurate mono-
graphs are still extant. In my opinion
there are no reasons for thinking that the
leprosy of the Bible was different in any way
from modern leprosy.

“Footslogger”: The 1360-year-old Shellal
mosaic mentioned by “Wilfrido” (B.
15/2/’23) is now housed in the Australian
War Museum in Melbourne. The Rev.
Maitland Woods, who superintended the ex-
cavation of the mosaic by the Light Horse,
reported that, “although the inscription con-
tains 8000 small pieces of mosaic, we did
not lose one single stone.” The work occu-
pied 14 days, and the mosaic floor was found
to measure some 27 feet by 18 feet. “Wil-
frido” errs slightly in his version of the head-
quarters wire in reply to the message from
the Light Horse, stating that the bones of
“Saint George” had been unearthed. Actu-
ally, it read: “No one of that name on our
strength; forward his identity disc!” The
dinkum St. George of Kappadokia, patron
saint of England, is supposed to have died
some 269 years before the Shellal mosaic
was laid down. A Greek inscription on the
marble reads: “He provided diligently for the
building of this church hero... .He who was
most saintly of us, and the most God-loving.
—George. Founded in the year 622 after
(Gaza).” The Australians discovered the
bones of a person, presumably. George, at
one end of the mosaic, and, after placing them
in a casket, deposited them in consecrated
ground.

“0.K.” on “the ministry of healing”:—
Commonsense criticism of healer Hickson
starts on a note of interrogation. Mr. Hickson
positively claims to possess a power that he inherited
in direct descent from the Apostles of the New
Testament. He can cure the blind, according to his
adherents. Then why does he not go into the Blind
Asylums, where he will find perhaps a larger pro-
portion of belief in Scriptural tradition than in any
other assemblage of afflicted persons ? There are
hospitals where the cure of one faithful patient would
carry conviction to his mates and create the atmo-
sphere of confidence in a “healing spirit of Christ”
which is apparently essential to any sort of Christian
Faith cure. Why doesn’t he walk the hospitals and
work miracles if he has the powers he claims? Mr.
Hickson’s method, as far as I am informed about it,
gets its successes mainly from the surroundings. He
obtains, but in a much larger degree, the atmo-
sphere so helpful to a spiritualistic medium, wherein
all the sincere assembled spiritualists sit expectant
of something going to happen. I have been there,
and can testify to the strength of the deceptive
influence for a while. After a time, when nothing
appalling has happened, the atmosphere lightens. 1
Expectation has exhausted itself. I speak of an
ordinary room' in a dwelling-house. How much
stronger must be the spirit of expectation in » huael
church building full of sick people (real or sup-J
posed) who have come to be touched and made’
whole! The malades imaginaires must be practically
cured before Hickson gets to them. In such an assem-
blage he must have a large number of the softest
possible snaps. ,
As to what Mr. Hickson says about his possession
of apostolic powers I am vividly reminded of tub
pretensions of the late “Elijah” Dowie. Thirty-eight-'
years ago, long before Dowie went to America and
established his tabernacle, I attended one of nia
“testimony meetings” at Fitzroy (Melb.). Thcrcr
he talked of a healing power which he held hw
common with the late prophet Elijah. There was
nothing in the Scriptures, he said, to suggest that
the world had been deprived of Elijah’s healing
power. The one thing the healer required was
implicit faith from his patient. Thus talks Hickson
to-day. Having professed his resemblance to Elijah,
the burly Howie told of a few miracles he had
worked, especially his cure of a cancer, by pressing
around it with a handkerchief whilst he and the
lady sufferer prayed together. “After which the
cancer rjn out into my handkerchief,” said Dowie.
Then he appealed to a puny, young woman in the
audience to say whether he had told the truth
about the cancer, and she popped up with “Quite
right, Mr. Dowie.” The scene of credulity was
never to be forgotten.
I don’t say Mr. Hickson is the brazen impostor
Dowie was, but I would remind all whom it may
concern that Hickson has not yet attained such a
large following as Dowie boasted while his Zion
Temple was being built in America.
The Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne now says
about healer Hickson: “Mr. Hickson’s main object
is rather to revive the ministry of healing in the
Church than to deal with all available sick folk
who may desire him.... Mr. Hi,ck«on is not practis-
ing as a professional healer.” After which the
Archbishop pleads for “fair play” for Hickson. The
Archbishop may think it a satisfactory explanation
to say that Mr. Hickson is not a “professional
healer,” but to the sick person it matters net
whether he call himself professional or amateur as
long as he is game to lay hands on the applicant.
To plead that he is not a “professional healer” is
evading the point. A miracle worker can work
miracles without being a pro., even as a conjurer
can perform amazing feats in an amateur capacity.
Why—and we come back to this every time —why this
elaborate series of preliminaries to a mission when
there are inmates of asylums calling out for cures?
So much more could be done in the simplest possible
way if Mr. Hickson chose to practise what he
preaches. I am pot unreasonable in my demands.
I believe now that he couldn’t cure my baldness,
prayed he never so wisely. But after he has triumph-
antly dealt with the blind and paralytic subjects
I spoke of, will I not be a simple believer? Indeed
I will! The conversion of unbelievers is not the
impossible matter that churchmen pretend to think
it. ’We ask to be cured of unbelief. We seek con-
vincing evidence and are put off with tales of
hysteria. In the kingdom of the credulous, any
sort of “healing” satisfies the true believer, as any
sort of bogus miracle convinces a circle of hard-
and-fast spiritualists. It is only from Unbelief
that true criticism can come. Therefore the main
object of Mr. Hickson should be to put unbelief
to shame before he proceeds to further business.
LEADING UP TO IT.
‘Miss Keytap, you, dress neatly, and you
have a well-modulated voice. I might
add that your deportment is also above
reproach.”
‘Thanh you very much, sir. But really I
don’t think you should, pay me such
compliments.”
‘That’s all right. I was just leading up
to the point of telling you that you
don’t seem to know a comma, from a full
stop, and your spelling is simply rotten”
A HOT NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The day has spent its fury, but the night
Feels its dark hand grow hot soothing the grass
From the long torture of the sun.- Airs pass
On drooping wings that scarce can hold their flight
Laden with such earth-sighings. Round the light
The flies and beetles their battalions mass
In resonant despair. A moon of brass
Above the smoky hills is angry bright.
The wooden house has voices of its own —
Ghost voices of the forest that must still
War with the nails and iron of the roof.
The glass shows ninety-eight. Mosquitoes shrill
Put citronella’s hatred to the proof,
And Enid is one sweet, perspiring moan.

THE MEDLEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This medley they call Life’s a make-believe,
A sham, a jazz for hypocrites to dance.
Convention: calls the tune in semibreve,
With here and there a pause thrown in, perchance,
While some new widow dries away her tear.
But I’ve no growl! The ball has long begun!
What’s the small matter of another one,
Since scarcely anybody knows I’m here?
On with the jazz! Let’s slacken not the pace ;
The going’s good ; I rather like the place!
I’m one of them, Convention has it so,
A hero or a villain in the show
(Perhaps a cypher’s part would suit me best).
No matter much; if I’m a thing for jest
Jest on! And floating with the tide would seem
Far easier than paddling up the stream.
What Custom wills, lest folk should think them rude,
Is the essential of the multitude.
And, plainly speaking, things could be much worse —-
For instance, two black horses and a hearse.
On with the jazz! Let’s slacken not the pace!
The way is smooth; I rather like the place.

“Gallery”: Scullin, M.H.R. for Yarra
(Vic.), considers that his chief claim to
immortality is his imitation of Prime Mini-
ster Bruce uttering his famous motto, “You
know, it’s not done.” Scullin delivers the
words with a telling burlesque of Bruce’s
lofty dignity, and no doubt they will be
used a good deal during the new Parliament,
especially as the P.M. has revealed sensi-
tiveness to the sarcasm. One can imagine
Anstey traversing recent political history,
and, whilst dwelling on the point whether
Bruce should have taken the Prime Mini-
stership after promising to sink or swim
with Hughes, sardonically remarking that
such things “are not done.” It will be an
irritating weapon in the hands of the Labor
crowd, who, apart from distrusting Bruce
on political grounds, dislike his remoteness.
It is a pity Bruce is so aloof. If he only
had George Reid’s gift of sharing a bag of
lollies or the latest yarn with his political
opponents, his stocks would bound upward.
A notable old figure in N.S.W. country
journalism has gone west, aged 84. For 49
years Foster Cooper had been editor and
part-proprietor of the Albury Banner, and
’most every day could be found at his job
any hour between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. As a
young Englishman he saw some of the rough
life of the “roaring days” of 60 years ago,
but settled at Albury in 1872. He was a
cultured and scholarly man with a lively
wit, and, as a relief from leader-writing and
politics, would occasionally try his hand at
turning out a comedietta.
The passing of John Greeley Jenkins (the
American who started business in Adelaide
as a book-agent and managed to save a sub-
stantial portion of his many years’ Minis
terial salary) leaves only four surviving ex-
S. Aus. Premiers—Doc. Cockburn, Dick
Butler, John Yerran and Crawford Vaughan
—and only three surviving ex-S. Aus.
Agents-General—Cockburn. Fred Young and
A. A- Kirkpatrick. Butler (S. Aus.
Speaker), aged 72, and Kirkpatrick, 75, are
the only ones holding seats in the State
Legislature. Young got into the House of
Commons when “Teddy” Lucas relieved him
of the Government billet.
Rabbi Boas (lacking the rabbinical dip-
loma, he was really only entitled to be called
Reverend) died in Adelaide last week at
77. He held the Jewish long-distance minis-
terial record for Australia —he retired owing
to old age in 1918, after 48 years in charge of
the Adelaide Hebrew congregation. As a
Talmudical scholar he was not far behind
Dr. Abrahams, of Melbourne, whom many
people think should have been given the
Chief Rabbinate in London, now held by Dr.
Hertz. Beyond his standing as a Hebrew
scholar, Boas was a Shakspearean of dis-
tinction. A grandson held the rather curi-
ous A.I.F. position of Jewish representative
with the Y.M.C.A. Most Yiddish communi-
ties have a kindred association to the Y.
Emma —the Young People’s Hebrew Asso-
ciation—but officialdom didn’t recognise any
fine distinctions.
One of the first names on the roll of
solicitors in N. S. Wales reappeared on it
when George Wigram Dundas Allen was
admitted to practice last week. The original
George Wigram Allen pursued Costs in
Elizabeth-street, Sydney. In the next gener-
ation the Christian names were divided be-
tween two brothers, George Boyce and
Arthur Wigram Allen; now, in the third
generation, the old name complete is re-
turned to legal surroundings. Costs were
not the only thing that laid the foundation
of the Allen fortune; they acquired some
very valuable landed estate in the compara-
tively early days.
G. P. Farrell, the new State Laborite for
Rockhampton (Q.), is about the youngest
member of Parliament in Australia, being
only 27. Born at Eidsvold, he was educated
at the Howard State School, then became
a pedagogue himself. He seems to have
known his job, for last year he coached 28
boys for the State scholarship exam, and
all passed—a record for Queensland. Far-

by the late P. J. McDermott, formerly
departmental Under-Secretary, a few weeks
before his (McDermott's) death. With a
prophetic insight, McDermott remarked dar-
ing the writing: “I feel as if it was my
own obituary notice.” Ryan has some very
notable neighbors: Joshua Peter Bell and
“Joey” Bell (father and son), Unmack,

Peter Jackson, the colored pugilist.
“Hedsabob”: Bendigo’s Town Clerk,
“Bill” Honeybone, 50 years ago entered the
Town Hall in an exceedingly junior capa-
city, has stuck to his job ever since, and this
year celebrates his municipal jubilee. Out-
side his purely official duties he has been a
prominent man in sporting and musical
circles, and to this day mayoral functions
and community singing trust to his baritone
to set the key. He claims that his. 50 years
of municipal work, involving service under
27 mayors, is a record for Australia. Any
contestants?
Clarence Pitman, nephew of old short-
hand Isaac, lives at Marysville (Vic.). A
son of Isaac’s elder brother Jacob (who
settled in S. Aus.), he was born 74 years ago
at Adelaide, which village he left when he
was 10. For many years he was a bank
manager in Vic.
Concerning a firm that once went bung:—
Fifty years ago last mor.th Tom .Nock, a kid of
13, went to work at Felton’s ironmongery store in
George-street North, delivering parcels. About 10
years later Felton took him into partnership, and
the firm became Felton and Nock. During the ’93
bank smashes the firm went under, and the creditors
carried on, with Nock as a shop-assistant at 50s. per
week, and Herbert Kirby was sent down by one of
the creditors as a counter-hand. At the end of
1894 Nock was still broke and couldn’t take advan-
tage of the creditors’ offer to sell him the concern
cheap. However, a friend came to light, mortgaged
his house, lent Nock the money, and Nock and
Kirby bought the remains. The original Felton
, establishment (Felton, by the way, is the father of
the sculler) was a single-fronted shop, but at odd
times since then 17 adjoining premises have been
bought up, including one wherein the S. M. Herald
was first published. Fifty years ago there was a staff
of two, Felton and young Nock. Now there are
just under 500, and the “heads” among them met
the other night to tell Mr. Nock that they hoped
he would be busy on the premises for another half-
century.

If Alfred Edmund Jaques keeps his hand
on the Costs machine until July next he
will have a record of 53 years’ practice as
a solicitor. Now the senior member of the
old firm of Stephen, Jaques and Stephen, he
celebrated his 75th birthday last week, and
is still hale. He never entertained any poli-
tical ambitions himself, but one of his sons
is the ex-Digger M.L.A.
“F.T.K.”: It is about time someone men-
tioned the man who first put artist Elioth
Gruner on the right track. In the ’nineties the
youngster attended the Macquarie-street (now
Commonwealth-street) public school and
the Christ Church Sunday-school (both since
demolished), and parson Gerard Trower,
then rector of Christ Church, included the
Gruner household in his parochial visita-
tions, Seeing the parlor walls adorned with
still-life studies and other youthful artistic
attempts, and shrewdly suspecting latent
ability, Trower urged Mrs. Gruner to send
Elioth to a competent teacher. Brother Fred
Gruner volunteered to' pay the fee for the
first quarter’s tuition, and so we get the
story taken up in “The Art of Elioth
Gruner,” by Julian Ashton, at the point
when a shy lad and his mother entered his
studio in 1894. Trower, a Cambridge man,
came from a curacy at St. Mary’s, Red-
eliffe, England, to Christ Church, Sydney.
Later, while holidaying in England, he was
offered by the Universities Mission the mitre
and pastoral staff of Liltonia in Central
Africa. After supplying Bibles and
chasubles to his ebony flock there, he was
translated to the new Anglican diocese of
North-West Australia. He was in Sydney
last October, looking none the worse for many
tough years among the blacks of two conti-
nents. Trower, by the way, is confidently
tipped as the next Metropolitan of W.A. on
the retirement of Archbish. Riley, of Perth.
This month John Clancy, of Darwin, will
reach his 76th milestone, and on Feb. 23 he
celebrated the 50th anniversary of his arrival
in the N. Territory. He has never had a
trip away since he landed there, and has
been variously assistant-surveyor, coach-
driver, road-maker (he cleared and formed
Darwin’s first
road), prospec-
tor and general
outdoor worker.

The G.O.M. of South Australian bug-
hunters, J. G. O. Tepper, died in Adelaide
the other day at 82. He came from Poland
as a child, and was a country school-teacher
till his keen study of insects made him a
master of the subject. For 28 years—he
retired in 1911 —he was entomologist at the
Adelaide Museum, and learned societies all
over the world knew him as a member.
R. F. Stuart-Robertson, a newly-fledged
Sydney solicitor, is the eldest of the 10
children of R. j. Stuart-Robertson M.L.A.
That hyphenated name sounds as if it
should be common enough, but it isn’t.
There is but one family of that ilk in Scot-
land, and the M.L.A., his brother and their
families are the only reps, of the name in
Australia.
George Allen, M.L.C., the great-grand-
father of young George W. D. Allen, who
was admitted last week to practise as a
solicitor in N. S. Wales, was enrolled as an
attorney in Sydney in 1822, and was the
first “Colonial” solicitor. The Allen firm
has had one continuous client since 1845,
when George Allen was appointed solicitor
to the Australian Gaslight Co.
The Sutton who sired lately-deceased Fred
Sutton, founder of the big Melbourne music
firm, set up his first music emporium in a
tent on the Ballarat diggings. The old man
took a hand in the Eureka business, and
when the storm had settled a bit moved into
a wooden structure, to which Ballarat flocked
because it was the first establishment in the
town with a pane of glass in its front window.
This astonishing evidence of enterprise was
just six inches by nine. The Suttons got
really moving out of divvies from the Band
and Albion mine, and extended to Melbourne
during the boom.
“Lou” on a ruddy pair:—
Two embarrassing union heads who don’t come to
heel when Theodore cracks the whip are George
Rymer and Tim Moroney, president and sec. of
the Bananaland branch of the Australian Railway-
men’s Union. In their monthly Advocate the pair
pour out a stream of vote-losing Red stuff and a lot
of nasty criticism of the Labor stalwarts. It was
probably their “unreasonableness” that moved the
Government to open its “deflation” knife and slash
a large slice from their membership. Rymer is a
Scotsman with a slow and impressive platform
style, and Moroney is effective in the court. Only
a couple of days before the Rockhampton ejection
the Brisbane Labor Council decided that vote-
bearing Labor politicians should go out and popu-
larise the Red objective—and Rymer was one of
the principal movers in the act. He is to represent
his union at the March conference, and is sure to
be busy painting the politicians’ election platform
an embarrassing red. After March, Rymer trips to
Russia, paying his own exes., while Moroney will
go on flailing the stalwarts.
Moonta (S.A.) has lost one of its best
men, W. H. Goldsworthy, who had just

he had held pretty well every position of
honor the town had to offer.
THE SLUMBER OF THE KING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sir H. Rider Haggard suggests that after the
necessary X-ray photographs and wax models of
Tutankhamen’s body have been made, the mummy
be sealed up in the chamber of the Great Pyramid,
in such a way that only the complete destruction
of the pyramid would reveal it. He says that the
relics of a people who in their way were as great
as we are, and certainly more religious, should be
sacred. It is ‘indecent and unholy’ to put the
mummies of great kings into the glass cases of the
Cairo Museum to rot and become a ‘merry jest to
tourists.’ The greatest horror of the Pha-
raohs was their fear of the desecration of their
tombs.’’

The lotus of the Nile has raised a petal
Of adoration to the royal sun.
Ten thousand barges glide along the waters,
The land is full of hammers beating metal,
The chipping of the chisels is begun.
The wheels are turning and the thread is spun
Finer and finer; and for Pharaoh’s daughters
The shuttle flashes and the bobbins run.
In narrow garden places roses clamber,
And in the shadowed angles of great walls
Are quiet foreheads bending over books—
Tales of strange chance along the Path of Amber
And words wherein the gem-set Orient calls
To some young Sindbad of adventurous looks.

The day is hushed, like a great golden bloom
That droops upon its stem for weight of light.
Close shutters hide each hot prayer-fluttered room ;
The great unrippled river in its might
Sings a low dirge, and on the temple height
A slow priest, standing, waits the hour of doom.
The king is robed and fragrant for the tomb
And goes on royal pilgrimage to-night.
And now with glare of torches, great gong-drums
And thunderous chant of voices on the air,
In one vast flame of gems and beaten gold
Great Pharaoh to the doors of silence comes.
Sealed in a granite splendor of despair,
The darkness falls about him fold on fold.
111.
His was the centre day of our long world,
lhree thousand years before men learned to read ;
Three thousand after we are reading still.
Then, as to-day, the battle flags were furled
Save in the outer lands that could not feed
The stream of knowledge and the fount of skill.
Yet the great years went sadly, faith and deed
Failing to match the clamor of the will.
Sleep peacefully, great Pharaoh! Egypt falls
Under the wreck of hopes as great as yours;
And the ink reddens to the gliding pen
That wrote in quiet on your golden walls.
Only the hope of your best hope endures
And men, for all the graves of hope, are men.
IV.
Rome loiters; Athens gossips; London eats
Long breakfasts to the heathen; Paris stares
At bare-backed women perfumed to distress;
New York, in nasal bragging of the feats
Wrought by its concentrated dollars, wears
Its splendors raw—a savage in a dress
Of beads too heavy for the rugged cares
Of hunting scalps within its cliff-bound streets.
And all the while in dark sepulchral pride
Great Pharaoh sleeps a s the slow ages spill
Their phantom light around his golden sorrow.
Ho, blow the resurrection trumpets shrill!
Let in the press! Break down the rocks that hide!
the king is rested. Pie must rise to-morrow.

The ESSEX,
which has lowered
three records:
Sydney-Melbourne,
Melbourne-Sydney,
Brisbane-Sydney.
THE LESSONS
THEY CONVEY.
An ordinary ESSEX chassis, taken from stock, with minor alterations, has on two
occasions within two months created new speed records between Sydney and Melbourne.
On the first run the average speed was over 37 miles per hour; on the second attempt the
average was 39 miles per hour. It has also since broken the Brisbane-Sydney record.
Apart from the sporting nature of these records, there is a definite policy behind our
decision to attempt them, a policy we wish to make clear to the general public.
We do not set out to try to prove that the ESSEX as a racing car is faster than the
cream of English and Continental special sports models, for we are well aware that for
actual speed accomplishment these specially-designed and costly machines are superior.
We set out to prove, and have most definitely proved, that the ESSEX, although an
inexpensive quantity-production American Car, is such a marvel of design, material and
workmanship that it can successfully compete with cars of nearly three times the price.
We wish to demonstrate to prospective car purchasers that in the ESSEX they can
secure without extra expense a car that is a marvel of efficiency and endurance. Not
suggesting that the average owner wishes to break records, but he does want to know
that he possesses a car that can stand the awful strain of such abuse if called upon to do
so in emergency, and will make light of the usual work for which it is required.
Can you imagine any other car of ESSEX class and price attempting these performances?
It is the mechanical marvel of the age.

“Durella”: They breed ’em tough out here,
bast week an old selector west of Quilpie (Q.) was
driving a two-horse dray, when the leader shed his
winkers. In the ensuing argument the old chap got
well kicked, knocked clean out, and sustained a broken
thigh. The leader kicked himself free of his trap-
pings and went bush, and when the aged Jehu came
to he couldn’t prevail on the shafter to budge. He
thereupon set out for the nearest habitation (eight
miles), the journey taking him three days and ten
hours, the conscious periods of that time being
limited. Anyone who knows Quilpie weather at this
time of the year will admit that such a feat is not
bad for a youth of 65. The shafter died four days
later where she stood. Our friend is doing splen-
didly in Quilpie Hospital.
“Sol”: There is grazing in a paddock near
Lismore (N.S.W.), and working when required, a
horse that had the shaft of a cab driven through’ its
abdomen (in one side and out the other) between
the bowels of the animal. The cab was owned by
a local cabdriver, and a vet. of the same town
repaired the punctured prad.

“Girofla”: The hading of a silver-
mounted boomerang in the tomb of Tutankhamen
gives that long-defunct old Gyppo a special interest to
Australians. Boomerang-shaped missiles are very-
rare among barbaric weapons. The earliest refer-
ence in literature to any instrument resembling the
’rang is in the “Aeneid,” written a couple of thousand
years ago. The Moquis tribe of Arizona (U.S.)
have a weapon which bears a faint resemblance to
it. Then the Veddahs, in Ceylon, and some of the
Dravidians, in Southern India, use a similar weapon.
The latter fact lends color to the assertion that the
boomerang was brought here by the first tribes that
crossed the Austro-Malay archipelago. This has
been the subject of much controversy, but those who
deny that Australia is the birthplace of the real
boomerang forget that there are two forms of the mis-
sile —the “return” and the “non-return.” The latter
is used only as a weapon of offence; and, although the
other is apparently similar to the “non-return” form,
it differs markedly from it, being “skewed” like a
propeller. It is this skew which endows the true
boomerang with such grace as it sweeps through the
air. Probably the Egyptians and some of the wild
tribes of India evolved a missile identical with the
“non-return” form, but the returning boomerang is
unknown outside this land. The silver-gum leaf as
it falls to the ground describes a curve somewhat
similar to that of the ’rang, and it was probably
from this that the ancient abo. got his inspiration
to fashion the most beautiful projectile known to
man.
“Delhi”: “Birre Gurra’s” vet. (B.
8/2/’23) may have put up a spaying record, bu 6 my
entry for effective castrating stands all on its own.
A pommy farmer in our district yarded two bulls
and after 12 minutes’ work with the knife adjourned
for lunch. On returning to the yard after the meal
he found another job waiting him —the skinning of
two dead stags.
“FY7”: The large black-and-white bird
“Harry Hardtimes” (B. 8/2/’23) saw on the lagoons
in the Norrnanby River (N.Q.) is the jabiru,
Australia’s representative of the stork clan, to which
the African saddle-bill and the Indian adjutant-bird
belong. One of the finest and strongest of Aus-
tralian birds, the jabiru was once common on W.
Queensland lagoons, though he is a rare fowl there-
about to-day. Still, the great swamps of the far
north will probably provide him and his friends, the
wild geese, with sanctuary for generations. . A
few years ago a wandering jabiru was shot by
some cocky assassin on the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.),
and the Sydney Sun had much to say about the
strange and rare “African” bird.
“M. Magee”: “Mulligan” (B. l/2/’23)
says that “in the far-west and nor’-west of Queens-
land carts are never used with travelling stock.”
Well, in the past 38 years 1 have travelled with both
cattle and sheep there, and my experience is that
carts or waggonettes invariably accompany the
mobs, unless they be small lots of fats, or a few
rams or bulls. A drover nowadays who carried
his supplies and cooking utensils on pack-horses
would find it hard to get men. They know that
a pack-horse turn-out means poor tucker, the
drover’s excuse being, “We can’t carry it.” I agree
with “Mulligan” as to the absurdity of lighted
lanterns encircling camps of travelling cattle, and,
until the present controversy started, never even
heard of such a thing.
“Sana”: Sometimes you can travel miles
in far-western Queensland and never see a bird ;
but around the artesian bores they congregate in
countless thousands. In a dry season I have seen
tank after tank fouled with dozens of drowned
leatherheads and lioneyeaters. When the water is
low the birds must perish within sight of the pre-
cious fluid. I have never once seen a humane con-
trivance —floats or a sloping pole— to enable the
birds to reach the water.

“Jim Carew”: “Ragar” B. 8/2/’23) takes
me to task for saying two jackasses proved their
sense of smell by the way they foregathered on a
box containing bad meat, and declares that this only
proved that Jack has a very poor nose, because he
won’t eat carrion. The very same “high” meat
that formed the subject of my par. proved otherwise.
The jackasses fairly gorged themselves on it. They
fed on it for several days, and it was carrion all
right—and dam’ smelly carrion at that.
“2HO” : Some slick branding performances
were posted by Abos. a while back. Here’s another.
With five men on the ground and three on horseback,
catching in a wire yard 50 x 50, we branded 98
calves in 58 minutes. We had to pull the calves up
to a post in the middle of the gateway, and the
horses had to cross back over the ropes. We had
three sets of irons in the fire, and- the brand used
was the well-known “2H0,” with an earmark on each
ear. I was in charge of the camp and one of the
five on the ground.
“Caerleon”: Re “Jobber’s” query (B.
l/2/’23) about a plant, whose name sounded like
“Cydracusia” growing in the North. It is called
Sida retusa by most people ; but Sida rhombifolia is
the proper name. It belongs to the cotton plant
(Gossypium ) family, which includes the roselle,
hibiscus and pavonia, or peacock-flower. I think ; t
was the late Walter Hill, once Curator at the Bris-
bane ißotanic Gardens, who was responsible for the
introduction of the plant, with a view to producing

fibre for rope-making. As “-Jobber” says, it tells
us when it is “high noon” all right—better than do
hundreds of watches these days. Some look on it as
an imported curse; but in a severe drought stock

good poultice to soften down a bad swelling when
used in the same way as marshmallow. All the

boiling.
“Daisy”: Who .says there’s not genuine
sentiment in the cow country? This letter (name
altered) was recently picked up on the roadside by
a traveller:—

“F.R.”: Somebody (B. 25/l/ T 23) is sur-
prised to hear “Abide with Me” played for a jazz.
But in the days before the phonograph distributed
music all over the country dance-tunes were scarce.
Twenty years ago, at a country “darnee” at Tich-
borne (N.S.W.), we had a lively mazurka to the
strains of “When He Cometh”; and I have waltzed
to “Peace Be Still” and found it lovely time. Some
of the bush musicians can make a well-known tune
do anything. It’s all in the way you hold the
accordeon —and your mouth.

“Ragar”: “Malokihi’s” native constable
(B. 15/2/’23) reminds me of a “boy” I had with me
when patrolling near Ixopo, S’AMca. He was a
second-year kaffir constable, and came from over the
Ztiluland border. His performance consisted of
doing 40 miles to his cobber’s kraal, attending the
wedding, having a good blow-out, jazzing with some
of the local experts, and returning to camp and re-
porting to me, all within 24 hours. I have heard of
both longer and quicker journeys made by these men,
but this was the best that came under my immediate
observation. I have had a couple of a kaffir police keep
pace across country with me when mounted on a fresh
horse, their steady run never breaking or checking.
More often than not they sing as they run, though
where they find the wind to do it the Lord only
knows.
"Pick”: I can’t agree with “Ned Kelly”
(B. 8/2/’23> that the soldier is the only wild-bird
alarmist. In that category I place above all the sea-
gull. His peculiarly harsh alarm note, while
circling aloft over an interloper, will send birds of
all kinds scurrying in apparent terror. The plover
comes a good second. A warning from him makes
bird and beast watchful and uneasy, and mobs of
cattle or sheep will often rush wildly when he
sounds the danger signal. Cranes on the rivers,
and shags on the lagoons, are the signallers most
observed by wild ducks. They are silent. But
when they take suddenly to hasty flight the ducks,
too, dart away without inquiry. In the forests,
where every sound or unusual appearance starts off
the soldier in. an excited clamor, little notice is
taken of him except, when he calls up his regiments
to vociferously combat an intruder on their domain.
But the very first gur-r-r-r of the coachwhip bird
puts to flight every pigeon, lyrebird or bush-quail
for acres around.
“Buttinski” does
Though not wishing to upset the experts advising
“Bullet” (B. 18/l/’23) on the best way of improv-
ing the killing power of his .22 rifle and, incidentally,
shortening his own years, let me suggest that a .22
is like a Ford car—a cheap expedient for knocking
’em over, and that “Leave well alone” is his best
motto. The pointing of a bullet is not merely
sharpening an end, as “Centurion” would lead one to
expect, but a careful and accurate balancing. Simi-
larly “Theo. D. Lite’s” idea that the velocity of a
bullet depends on the quantity of powder behind it
doesn’t fit in with the results when using Mark VI
and Mark VII ammunition in the .303 service rifle.
It’s not so much the quantity as the rapidity of the
charge in being exploded. Then “Ack. F.C.’s” heavy
discourse on rifling proves that,- like all gentlemen
of the flying corps, he has a very hazy idea of the
footslogger’s weapon. An examination of a spent
bullet from a .303 will show the marks of the
lands on its surface, proving that the bullet is
forced into the grooves, not because the rifling “has
been designed for certain loads and certain veloci-
ties,” but to make the bullet go into and follow
the grooves up the barrel, thus giving it its spin to
keep its point foremost, and ensure accuracy of
flight. The erratic “spin,” therefore, could not take
A QUTCK RESCUE.
“Bet yer wouldn't be so frightened of failin’
in if it was beer.”
“Course not, 'Enery; you’d soon drink me

place. It might rotate faster , but not erratically.
As a matter of fact, using a charge as suggested
by “Nitro-Glycerin” would, owing to the softness
of the bullet used in the .22, leave most of the lead
on the lands; and this, if not removed after each
shot, would choke the rifle and finally cause it to
burst.

HAULIN’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In silken socks and summer-weights Bill spends his
working day ;
Jim, lily-fingered, serves his bank in quite a courtly
way ;
George fiddles with a yardstick in the mazes of the
Lane,
And somehow Jack subsists upon the strivings oi
his brain.
But where, on distant tracks, the dinkum toiler's
lot is cast,
With Percival and Lancelot are my hours of labor
passed.
Up the long track, in clouds of dust where sweat-
grimed Lancelot goes,
Blessing his loafin' “cows” with all the rich, warm
words he knows,
Wild Percy, full of furious sounds, comes racing
in the rear,
A moving, wrathy noise that shocks the unaccus-
tomed ear ;
While, far, immortal Feathertop sits calmly in the
sky
And watches us in sombre haste go fulminating by.
To men like Bill and Jim it may seem somewhat
sad and strange
To hear a raging Eric grimly roaring down the
range,
The blue-blood of his ancestors a-boiling in his
veins,
While Nugget, in a lather, groans and grumbles
and complains,
With Ginger earning all his oats, old Spider rolling
wide,
And Paddy’s breeching due to burst against his
bulging hide.
Yet up the hill and (jown, from dewy morn to
grimy eve,
We shout and shove, yell, sweat and swear and,
dripping, howl and heave ;
Though Percy profit not by what he learned nt
mother’s knee,
And Eric clean forget himself and curse like you or
me,
Up the big hill, and down again, we chase our
daily crust,
Constrained by all fair-do’s to keep the tally right
or bust!

TUDOR
Batteries
for
COUNTRY HOUSE & FARM LIGHTING SETS
There are many satisfactory House-lighting
Plants from which to choose, but, to ensure
satisfaction, you should specify that the
Battery which accompanies the plant you
select must he a Tudor.
The Tudor Battery will last longer, and will
keep you free from the worries that are
known to the owners of less reliable batteries.
When trouble is experienced with House-
lighting Plants it is usually battery trouble.
Eliminate these worries by insisting that your
Battery be a Tudor.
Tudor Batteries are designed and built to give
a maximum life at a minimum expenditure
for maintenance. More than fifty municipali-
ties and town councils in Australia have
installed Tudor Batteries in their Lighting
Stations.
The Tudor Accumulator Co., Ltd.
(London), maintains its own staff
of Battery Engineers and fitters in
Australia, and is at all times at
your disposal for battery help and
service.

IN THE LARD OF WHIPS O’ TIME.
BRIDEGROOM ( after the ceremony) : “Go on, mister, you can 'are first kiss — there’s plenty
coming for me after."
“R.P.”: Re “Merrigal” (B. l/2/’23) and
the speed of birds. Recently, while I was crossing
the plains per Ford between Aramac and Barcaldine
(Q.), some plain turkeys flew up, and one continued
on along the road ahead of the car, but out of gun-
shot. To give the man with the gun a chance for
a shot we put the old machine up to 35 miles an
hour ; but the “turk” simply waltzed away from us,
and must have been going well over 40 miles an
hour —-an astonishing speed for such an unwieldy
fowl.
* # # »
“Noswad”: Anybody who knew Longreach
years ago will remember Jimmy Ah Foo, who kept
the Royal Hotel. He married a hefty woman from
the Emerald Isle, and had two grown-up half-caste
daughters. When the Irish shearers used to gather
there at shearing time he used to break up the house
with: “Come on, Annie, sing ‘Dear Littee Shamlock’
an’ make you poo’ ole father’s heart bleed.”
“Alkaloid”: Bet’s have finality in the
drink-acd-weight argument. In the Melb. ’Varsity
physiology school is a weighing-machine with con-
siderable pretensions to accuracy. Weighing-in on
this is frequently practised by visitors immediately
upon entering and just before leaving the school, and
the result is invariable —a dead loss at the second
weighing. Sitting on the machine discloses a pro-
gressive loss in weight, which may be counteracted
by enveloping the weighee in a hermetically-sealed
overall, thus preventing escape of respiratory pro-
ducts. Weighing before and after a feed gives the
weight of the feed. The experience of “C.F.S.” (B.
8/2/’23) only demonstrates that the baby went with-
out its tucker, or perhaps the weighing processes call
for improvement. Let him try the experiment
again.
“Northwood” : When “Aves” (B. 25/l/’23)
asked if bulbuls were fruit-eaters, I began to watch
them closely in my orchard; and I now pronounce
them guilty in the- third degree. They tear junks
out of the half-ripened peaches, eat all the nectarines
and don’t even give the silver-eyes a look-in. In
the words of the poet “They shall die-ee!”
“L. R£e” : At Broken Hill, in 1892, when
the B.H.P. Co. was straddling the South Road with
its big railway viaduct, three of the co.’s massive
draught-horses (its one vanity those days) were
pulling trucks on the freshly-laid decking. One
slipped on the unguarded edge and hung by its fore-
legs for a tense second or two over the 65ft. drop,
then let go and dragged the other two with
him. One fell into the V between the giant strut
and the retaining wall and was ruptured fore and
aft; another fell into the road and was so wrecked
that he was shot at once by the horse boss. The
third hit the middle of the roadway, rolled over a
couple of times, got on his feet, gave a protesting
snort and trotted off to his stable, where, he was
found quietly feeding five minutes later.
* * * *
“Mulgaite” : Anyone know of,a jumbuek
barber with a better punch than Tom Heatley, who,
at 70, resumed his old calling this season, after
having followed mining on the eastern goldfields
of Westralia for 22 years? Before coming west Tom,
in the ’seventies and ’eighties, barbered from the
Bananaland border to the Murray, and was declared
the ringer of many a shed. His present occupation
is running a beer-dispensary north of Leonora, and
trade being slack at the Soak and the local land
men having a few hundred jumbucks to undress, Tom
waded in and did the job. His best tally w'as 97 in
one A.W.U. working day.
* * * *
“Cmsar”: A recent par. about Clement
Wragge trying to break the drought recalls the
time, many years ago, when a lot of damphools paid
two shillings ahead to see Captain Pepper ascend
in a balloon to break the rain clouds with a gun
at Wynnum (Q.). The captain missed the chance
of a lifetime. Something went wrong with the
balloon, so he didn’t go aloft—but on their home-
ward journey the crowd of sight-seers got drenched.
* * * *
“Wonki”: “Widgee” (B. S/2/’23) is
right about horses having a quick sense of danger.
Some years ago I was riding along a road when the
horse propped so suddenly that I nearly continued
the journey on my own. Just as the prad stopped a
tree fell across the road a few feet in front of us.
Had that neddy not put on the brake instantaneously
it’s a billion to a bandicoot that I’d be doing five-
finger exercises on the harp to-day.
* * * *
“Wandi”: The pitun plant (Duboisia
hopwvodi ) belongs to N.-W. Queensland ; but a species
known as the native cork-tree ( Duboisia myoporoides)
grows in the Richmond and Tweed River
(N.S.W.) brushes. An intoxicant was
made by the infusion of the leaves of
this small tree, and it was also used for
poisoning fish. In S.-E. Queensland the
tree was called Bancroft’s Eye Plant.
Dr. Joseph Bancroft, who considered
duboisine, the extract from the leaves,
superior to atropine for dilating the
pupil of the eye, cultivated the tree near
Brisbane for medical purposes. A Ber-
lin ophthalmic hospital was said to have
paid a thousand pounds casli some years
ago for one pound weight of the ex-
tract of duboisia leaves. A vegetable
of that value is worth an effort to save
from the axe and firestick, which have
accounted for so many valuable Australian trees
where the big jungles used to grow.
“Bad Australian”: “F. Seedy’s” tank-
sinker (B. 8/2-/’23) seetns to have struck one of
the snake camps and breeding grounds occasionally
found in stiff clay country. The spot chosen for
the tank would, of course, be in a depression, and
the soil in the bottom of the depression, being com-
posed of detritus, would naturally be of a much more
friable nature than the surrounding country.
Wherever such soft spots occur in heavy clay coun-
try snakes may be found, particularly during
winter. I have seen a number of these camps or
hatcheries containing dozens of reptiles of various
breeds and sizes, in localities where snakes did not
appear to be unduly numerous in the warm months.
If a snake is not handy to one of these camping
grounds he usually makes his winter lodging where
a post or root has rotted out. Some years ago I
came across a big, raw-boned Irishman filling in
an old boundary ditch, and erecting a new fence
as his work progressed. He said he had killed at
least 600 snakes in about 40 rods of ditch —and by
the look of the dead snake scattered over the land-
scape I quite believed him.
* * * *
“Wattamolla”: With the help of Ridg-
way’s color scheme E. Nubling has been delving
further into the eye for color of the bower-birds in
the National Park (N.S.W.). While he had the
book open at one bower, in order to compare the
colors with those of, the leaves placed in the bower
by the birds (mostly those of the broad-leaved bank-
sia, with a few mistletoe and shrub leaves), the
owner of the parlor came along. He didn’t seem to
think very much of Ridgway’s greens and yellows,
for, after one tug at the leaf of the book, he gave
up the idea of adding them to his collection.
• * * »
“The Stranger”: One more queer acci-
dent. A young man, driving the mail in Ida Valley
(M.L.), in 1895, left on his last seven-mile stage,
but did not turn up at home. His brother went in
search of him and found the horse still yoked in the
gig? grazing in the home paddock, and the lad, dead
and frozen stiff, trailing under the gig with one
arm over the axle. There were no marks of violence
on the body, and only a few hours elapsed from the
time he left on the last stage until he was found.
The cause of death and how he came to be hanging
on the axle remain a mystery.
* * * *
“Lenah”: “Azrim” (B. 4/l/’23), on the
subject of bees, says that when the pollen supply
runs short cocoa comes easily first as a substitute.
Seeing that each colony of bees requires about lewt.
of pollen per year, cocoa as a substitute is hardly
practicable. Also there are no such things as
“native” bees. Bees were brought to Australia by
early settlers and the bush bees are merely their
descendants. These bush bees are not, as a rule,
savage, but if they are roughly handled they will,
of course, resent the treatment. If the bees like the
person who is taking the honey, there is no trouble,
but they will tackle anyone they don’t like, and
instinct tells them who is kind to them. Also they
have a keen sense of smell and will not allow any
person near the hive who has any scent or odor
about him which annoys them. “Sucre” (B. 4/l/’23)
mentions a snake being stung to death. A colony
of bees becomes greatly upset when there is a snake
in the vicinity—and bees can usually defend them-
selves against their enemies. A few weeks back 1
noticed a skylark flying just above the trees in
the orchard being pursued by about two dozen
bees. It probably had picked up a bee to eat and
then was attacked by others. The skylark was
obviously in difficulties, but I think it got away in
the end. Bees always have a few workers detailed
to guard the entrance to the hive and give warn-
ing when an enemy approaches. They don’t seem
to mind lizards, as one camps under the top cover
of one of our hives, and is usually to be seen when
the cover is lifted.
* * * *
“Pantagruel” : I came across a red-backed
spider the other day—quite an ordinary, normal
chap, except that the red on his back was broken
by three silver stripes. Is it a common species, or
a freak, or am I the discoverer of something new in
the spider line?
* * * *
The R.S.P.C.A. president seeks a few tips:
Following a request from the R.S.P.C.A. to provide
shelter-sheds and plant trees on the Homebush
(N.S.W.) j abattoir area, the Metropolitan Meat Board
says it has given directions for “the erection cf
about 26 shelter sheds.” Now we want advice cn
THE TIME OF HIS ( HIC) LIFE.
“Eh, but Ah had a time last year-r. Ah was
at ma cousin MacWhukie’s a whole
fortnight, an ’ Ah didna ken Ah teas
there."
the following questions, and would be glad if men
of practical experience would write at once: (1)
Will stock feed or drink while in trucks, if the
food and water can be kept from fouling? (2) If
water sprays were fitted to trucks, would it be
dangerous to cattle or shorn sheep when crossing
the mountains at night? (3) Would the knocking-
about vvliich stock will sustain in being untrucked,
watered and fed en route be worse than running them
through? (4) Can any basis of loading be arranged
to prevent overcrowding in trucks? (5) Other advice,
apart from quickening transit. We hope to arrange
a deputation of experienced men to wait on the
Railway Commisisoners, but first desire further
information on these matters.
THE LURE OF THE SWAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The old Dad’s nearly eighty now,
Twice thirty-five and ten;
A sailor’s blood is in his veins,
And they are restless men.
He said he’d like another trip—
Just one —before the end,
And go where western shearers go
And western rivers bend.
And so I took him round with me
By tracks he used to know,
Through fenced-in lanes and over plains
Where shearers mostly go.
We’d rolled our swags with clumsy hands,
And swung them shoulder high,
With calico beneath the straps
To keep the blankets dry.
Our moleskin pants were new and stiff,
With bowyangs at the knee ;
We took some books to trade the cooks
For flour and meat and tea.
We saw the shed where he had shorn —
He was the ringer then —
When backs were straight and hearts were
light,
And we were younger men.
But now we saw no gleaming blades,
The shearers did not sing,
But rushing belts and whirring wheels
With rhythmic beat and swing.
The rousies did not laugh and joke,
But grumbled at their toil,
As sweat fell dripping to the floor
And mingled with the oil.
We rested there until we saw
The last sheep down the shoot
(The old shed roof once silver white
Is spattered now with soot) ;
And then the shearers moved away
To stations further back ;
Some went by car that took them far
Beyond the beaten track.
The swagman’s hut was much the same,
With litter on the floor,
And bushmen’s names and, bushmen’s games
Engraven on the door;
And in the dirt we saw a shirt,
A clock in many parts,
And of a tattered pack of cards
Remained the King of Hearts.
And then we took the winding track — •
The track that never ends—
Where bush in virgin glory stands
Along the river bends.
And there we camped as we had camped
Some thirty years ago;
To-day my thinning hair is grey,
And his is white as snow.
We tramped across the blacksoil plains
As we had often done,
And saw the sandhills straight ahead
Blood red beneath the sun.
The sky was flecked with flocks of birds
That flew and settled where
The tracks of sheep were wide and deep
And water glistened there.
We saw a storm rise in the west,
Blue-black and lined with red,
Like smoke clouds in the horizon,
And gather overhead.
The red dust rose and dimmed the sun
And rolled across the plain,
With whirling sand on either hand,
But not a drop of rain.
PLAYING THE GAME.
“You must find it tiring sitting about all
day.”
“Flurry tiring, boss; but I not too lazy to
do it!”
And as we passed an old bush pub
We gave it just a glance,
And saw the rabbits playing where
The drovers used to dance.
The window-frames had fallen out,
The cellar fallen in,
And stencilled faint in fading paint
We read the name of Flynn.
And then we took the rattler home,
As in the days of old
When we had cashed our cheques and filled
Our purses up with gold.
We poked our swags beneath the seat . . .
I saw him looking back
And heard a sigh that meant good-bye
To life along the track.

More Power where Power Counts
THE Case Tractor delivers ample power where
power counts- —at the draw-bar and belt. No more
worry about getting the job done right and on time
—the Case takes the grades and makes no fuss about
its work on the farm. It has plenty of reserve power.
Any competent engineer will tell you:—
That a tractor engine will deliver more power continuously
through a few simple spur gears than through any
other type of transmission.
More power through few gears than through many.
More through machine-cut, hardened steel gears than
through rough cast gears.
More through enclosed gears, well oiled and protected,
than through gears or chains exposed to dust, dirt,
and grit.
More through roller bearings than through plain bearings.
And that all these “better” features mean longer life for
the tractor, lower upkeep expense, more work for the
fuel consumed.
These “Letter” features ar'e Case features, as you may see
in the illustration above, where the side of the tractor has
been cut away to show the few, simple spur gears that make up
the Case transmission and final drive. Other tractors have
some of these features. Case has them all.
Any experienced user will tell you that the one best place
for a tractor belt pulley is on the engine crankshaft where the
full power of the engine is available for belt work. Look at
the Case—pulley on crankshaft, directly in front of steering
wheel—plenty of clearance and in plain view of the operator
when lining up and backing into the belt.
These are some, but nowhere near all of the features that
make the Case Kerosene Tractor the standard of efficiency and
economy for farm power work.
We are here to show you why you can better afford to
buy a Case than any other tractor. See us for valuable infor-
mation that will help you to avoid expensive mistakes in the
buying of your tractor.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

The Society of Artists carved a fareAvell
fowl in honor of Elioth Gruner one night
last week at the Cavalier. The young man
Avith the central hair-parting looked palely
doAvncast, and consumed mainly cigarettes
until after his speech in reply to Julian Ash-
ton. After that he revived and joined cheer-
ily in the applause handed to the other word-
weavers. Julian Ashton looked along the
board with kindly eyes at these astonishing
young men, nearly all of whom he had
trained to be artistically articulate. Lam-
bert, on his left, Gruner a little to the right;
Sid Smith filling his place as president. Op-
posite to him Ethel Stephens and Thea Proc-
tor, and a long line of men, each filling the
niche that Julian had helped him to carve.
Perhaps this was his night even more than
Gruner’s. Longstaff was there, too, and B.
E. Minns, Will Ashton and Muir Aiild. John
Lane Mullins and Howard Hinton l’epre-
sented the Art Gallery. And Solomon in all
his glory was not arrayed like Ernest Watt,
Avho wore a Avliite mess-jacket, while Mrs.
Ernest was in cool-looking green.
This will be Gruner’s first visit to Europe,
and, lamb-like, he has taken on the task
of looking after the exhibition of Australian
art in London. How much time that
job will leave him for “moochin’ round” art
galleries and exhibitions goodness alone
knows, but he doesn’t seem to mind, and
lifted a grateful head Avhen John Lane Mul-
lins explained that he wouldn’t be expected
to actually hang the pictures—only to carry
the cases to and from Tilbury, and things
like tlrat.
Dropped into Sydney last week by the
Ormonde a tiny woman with a mission the
size of half the world. Her name is Mrs. De
Castro; and she is here to promote a good
understanding between the people of the
United States of America and the British
Commonwealth. For short the Ideal calls
itself the English-speaking Union, and its
president in England is Earl Balfour (Avho
aa as more known to fame as Mr. Arthur Bal-
four), while John W. Davis is president of
the venture iii the United States. Its objec-
tive is peace on earth, goodAvill to men.
There was a preliminary planning of the
campaign after the lady had had her creden-
tials hall-marked by Government House,
and, strangely enough, the morning it fell
upon Avas the anniversary of George Wash-
ington’s birthday. Vice-regalty and heavy-
Aveight thinkers like the McMillan lady and
Mrs. Margaret Dale are already roped into
the scheme.
MidAvay through last week George Wash-
ington had his birthday, and about 50 mem-
bers of the American colony in Sydney cele-
brated it for him in the jazz-room of the
Australia. The food memorial Avas a stag
party—even an American husband Avas
afraid of the twinkle in his wfffe’s eye when
he was drinking deep to the man who couldn’t
tell a lie. Drinks? Of course, there were
drinks! Can you deprive the nation that
created the cocktail of its birthright? A
long queue of food-stuffs followed the leader
around a board that was picketed with Uncle
Sam’s and Australia’s flags hobnobbing cheer-
ily if limply in the breathless atmosphere.
Henry Braddon, who is a kind of universal
speech-provider, talked about Americans in
Australia, while James Ashton told what he
knew of Australians in the U.S.A., and the
silken manner of Vice-Consul Moseley Avas
to the gathering Avhat oil is to the salad
P. A. van Buttingha Wichers, tall and
slim, with a toothbrush moustache and a
keen interest in everything Australian, has
come across from Melbourne to look after
the interests of the Netherlands in the
absence of Consul Teppema. He expects to
put in nine months here, and he and his
wife (she was Dr. Delprat, daughter of the
erstwhile general manager of the Broken
Hill Prop.) are busy shaking down into
Wamba, the Industrial Addison place in
Fairfax-road, Bellevue Hill.
Doone Macken, Avliose engagement after
a few weeks’ romance to a Colombo beau
caused a flutter among Sydney’s dancing
lads and lasses, gave her set another shock
last week by walking out from home one
morning and marrying Dr. Howard Bullock,
of Macquarie-street. What her former fiance
will say as he re-addresses the Essex car
(Avhich rumor claims to be already on its way)
staggers imagination. And there’s a white
satin and silver-tissue wedding frock that
Avill never rustle to the thrill of Mendelssohn.
Bert McLaclilan, of Mosman, pursuer of
Costs, and eldest son of the late Hugh
McLaclilan, Secretary for Railways, will
next Saturday Aved Rita Palmer, of Brad-
ley’s Head, daughter of the well-known mer-
cery folk. The affair promises to be pic-
turesque, and there ivill be a revel afterwards
at the local Town Hall.
A well-knoAvn Westralian girl, Kathleen
Vernon Ross, leaves on the Narkunda in
April for India to marry Captain Joscelyn
Percy, M.C., of the Durham Light Infantry.
The Vernon Rosses were originally Sydney
folk, but have been in the West for some
years. Kathleen’s grandfather, the Rev.
Robert Ross, M.D., preached in the Pitt-
street Congregational Church nearly a cen-
tury ago, and she is a grand niece of medical
knight Philip Sydney Jones.
Clive S. Inch, secretary of the Co-opera-
tive Assurance Co. in Victoria, a son of the
managing director of the co. in Sydney, is
to be married this week at Murwillumbah
to Nita Campbell, the seventh of the charm-
ing daughters of Robert Campbell, of Mel-
rose station. Bridegroom was a member of
the 2nd Flying Corps, and Avas wounded in
France. The honeymoon will be spent at
Blackheath and Brisbane.
A couple with a clean record ahead of
them, if names mean anything, are Vera
Isabel Tubb, of Rose Bay, Avho married
Philip Saville Soper, of Maroubra, at St.
Philip’s one night last week. There should
be no dirty linen in that family cupboard !
The bald announcement in the dailies that
Lady Ursula Grosvenor, daughter of the
Duke of Westminster, was to marry a jockey
name Jack Anthony created an impression
that one of the heiresses of the richest duke
in England had become affianced to a fag-
smoking mannikin who had begun life as
a stable-boy. The fact is the prospective
’groom was for years a fashionable amateur
rider, and is well off on his own account.
He now does more training than riding,
being fully as old as the young Avoman’s
father.
The Simpson-Kings, who have been honey-
mooning at Katoomba and Young, are hang-
ing up their neAV aluminium pots at Etham
Flats, Darling Point. The bridegroom has
been mainly in Papua for the past decade.
At last it has come, and Sydney’s harbor
now boasts its jazz ferry. Geoffrey Bernays
and Roly Brennan organised the venture, and
are the big chiefs in Harbor Cabarets, Ltd.,
xvhieh is the title under Avhich they have
registered the brain-wave. The floating ball-
room has been christened the Romantic, and
it made its first real voyage (it had a trial
spin a couple of weeks back) on the hottest
night of last week. The top deck is cleared
for action: it has gay lattice and awning
around the sides ; and the trail of the grape
was everywhere the other night, lending quite
a Bacchante effect; the whole was dazzlingly
lighted with orchid-shaded lamps—even the
lifeboats carried an unnecessary flare or two.
The loAver deck is given over to food and
refreshment. But the opening night was a
washout rather than a blowout, for, although
there Avas a beautiful list of foods, about
twice as many guests turned up as had been
imdted, and only the clever ones had a chance
to exercise their digestive organs. The ferry’s
first voyage took in Cockatoo Island, back
to the starting-point (Fort Macquarie), then
Rose Bay. Mrs. George Vivers and Mrs.
Willsallen were two of the smart late-
comers, and Helen Laidley was effective in
black Dr. Clayton’s wife and sister
Rita Bucldand Avere others among the 300-
odd dancers.
The good-looking Dean of Sydney and his
attractive wife are off to Europe by the
Argyllshire early next month. Dean Talbot
will be aAvay 12
months, but his
Titian-haired lady
will stay longer, as
she intends taking
up her violin studies
once ag a i n—pro-
bably in Paris. On
her Avay home to
Australia she hopes
to link up with
sister Bernice Vere,
who is busy in New
York making pic-
tures with Gloria
Swanson. The Syd-
ney girl has had
luck in her adven-
ture in America’s
film world. On arri-
val she played lead
in a series of Bibli-
cal pictures, and from the Old Testament
stepped into an up-to-the-minute shadow
drama, “Burning Sands,” in the making of
which she Avas camped for days in something
so close to a desert that a bath was out of
the question. Mrs. Talbot’s photo herewith
is from the Swiss Studios.
Mrs. Verbrugghen had two poignant re-
grets about going away. The first was at
leaving her young doctor son here with no
one to look after him ; the other was about
her cherished porcelain, crystal, silver, plate
and beloved French editions. Madame had
considerable worry about these before, for
on the voyage from Europe about one-third
of her collection Avas lost, and, rather than
risk a possible repetition, she sent her books
to Angus and Robertson’s, and the china,
etc., to Tyrrell’s. So that was disposed of.
The Fates adjusted the other matter with the
aid of Cupid, for Madame was dutifully in-
formed by her son, Dr. Adrian, that bonnie
Betty Dangar, only daughter of the N.
Dangars, of Point Piper, had consented to
take up the job of looking after him. And
that was that.
An old (yet-not-so-old) inter-State
lacrosse-star, George Ashwin Yuill, has just
been admitted to the ancient Norton Smith
law firm. He served his articles with Angas
Parsons (now a Judge) in Adelaide, and
there he started to keep goal for S. Aus. —
and went on doing it till lie came to Sydney
to do the same thing for N. S. Wales. He
has other interests now, but he is still an
active member of the council of the Austra-
lian Uni. Sports Association.
Australia’s Rear-Admiral Dumaresq had
the knack of acquiring friends. This quality
was evident to the
very last hours of
his life, when the
gallant-looking chap
alongside in the
Uncle Sam uni-
form gave a quan-
tity of his blood in
a vain attempt to
save the life of the
former Australian
Admiral. The man
who thus made him-
self a friend of all
the boys of our navy
is Sergeant Andrew
Penl a n d, of the
Hawaiian Military
Department, and the
transfusion took
place at Manila in
August of last year.
In recognition of his unselfish act the Naval
Comrades of N. S. Wales in October made
the American sergeant a life member of their
association, and through the Consulate here
presented him with a gold pendant. Ser-
geant Andrew now further cements the
entente by presenting his own and the pen-
dant’s photograph to the Naval Comrades.
Mrs. Beaufort Burdekin, whose novel
“Anna” was published by John Lane last
year, has since written a blank-verse .play.
“Morgan le Fay” is the name of it, and
it was produced successfully by a fashion-
able crowd of amateurs in the West End
of London the other day.
The Engineer-Commander Starr couple,
who leave for England early next month,
gave a small-size farewell on Sydney’s old
friend the Encounter. The guest-list was
almost confined to the Naval Station, and
included the Commodore Mclvor Edwards
couple, the Nelson Clovers and the Webbs.
The Queen Victoria Club decked itself
with purple asters for pianist Lily Juncker’s
farewell party, which Mrs. George Taylor
and Mrs. Annie Perry hostessed. Lily had
smart black-and-white georgette frocking for
the occasion, and had only one rival in point
of interest —Mrs. Perry’s mother, who w r as
gaily celebrating her 76th birthday. Dulcie
Deamer put away her fountain-pen for an
hour or so, and recited kilometres of Kipling
to an enthusiastic room-full.
The women’s committee of the Mater
Misericordise Hospital is busy once again
over the annual fair in aid of the big North
Side institution. It will be held in the
grounds from March 21 to 24. Tireless Mrs.
Leahy is president.
Mrs. Alec Gordon, who is Welsh herself,
opened the C.vmrodorion Society’s fair last
Saturday at St. James’s. Mrs. Alec is just
back from Bowral. where she and the child-
ren and Mrs. Grossinith have spent two
months. The Judge went to his old haunt,
Tasmania, where the Justice Streets also
camped. Mrs. Street, incidentally, spent
most of her time on the Apple Isle in hos-
pital, and was for some days in a serious
condition. She is now recovering slowly.
Mrs. Grossmith has joined her Ambrose
Applejohn in Melbourne.
Adolph Steber, manager of the N. S.
Wales Bank’s Sydney office, and his wife are
outward bound by the Ormonde.
The C. T. Burfitts, of Bellevue Hill, cele-
brated their golden wedding the other day.
The marriage took place at St. Patrick’s,
Church Hill, the celebrant being Father
Mounier. The bridegroom’s father owned
Springfield, Carcoar, and the lady was a
Fitzmaurice from County Cork. Burfitt is
a Fellow and past president of the Royal
Australian Historical Society, and the autho-
rity on early land grants.
Pretty Ailsa Craig (she is Ailsa Grahame
on the boards) is coming back to Australia
and her home town as a member of the “If
Winter Comes” Company. Ailsa was a
famous war worker in the early days of the
upheaval, and she and her sister had quite
a lot to do with running the vegetable shop
for soldiers’ wives and dependents. Later
she went to England and walked straight
into a part in the Coliseum. Her most popu-
lar work was as Jo in “Little Women.” hut
lier outstanding artistic triumph was in the
two Dunsany plays, “The Tents of the
Arabs” and “Cheeso.” The wild Irishman
wrote her a note of thanks which read:
“Thank you for the great help your art has
given to mine!” Ailsa’s first public appear-
ance was made in Sydney when she was a
pupil of Kay Souper’s, and a member of
the old Stage Society.
A traveller arrived in Sydney came across
the Australian Kennedy family recently, just
starting to tour S’Afriea with a company of
entertainers—mother and two sons; piano,
violin, flute. Brother Laurie remains in
London ’celloing with Melba before the great
ones of the earth.
Artist Evelyn Chapman writes from the
Fog: “We are trying to persuade daddy that
the weather is not really cold, but with blue
noses and chattering teeth it is difficult!”
Daddy (Francis Chapman! is tugging at the
silken thread, woven by wife and daughter,
that holds him in Europe; he gets very
restless in January, when John Bull’s chim-
ney smokes furiously over the hearthrug.
The Sydney girl is busy getting pictures
ready for the Paris Salon, which accepts her
work each year.
In the Park-street window of Murdoch’s
is displayed a collection of glazes from the
Soldiers’ Pottery. One jug bears the golden
glow of gorse; and the black glazes are very
fine. One quaint pitcher in black, of Egyp-
tian design, might have come from the trea-
sure-house of some Pharaoh’s tomb. The
float bowls and pitchers are particularly
graceful.
In Horderns’ Gallery there are a few
beautiful specimens of batik art. Some hand-
bag designs and a wonderful cushion-cover
will appeal most to the female eye. Unlike
the two-color batik of olden days, this work
is warm with color, and is carried out in
artistic and graceful designs. The creator is
Mrs. Hemelaers, who originally came from
Beech worth (Vic.).
Sydney has got used to the kimono-clad
naiad who, bent on surfing, boards the tram
on the last section at Bondi or Coogee, or
floats along the streets of Manly; but there
was a craning of necks in passing vehicles
and cars when, one recent afternoon, three
girls in the garments of the beach, lightly
kimono-covered, nonchalantly made their sea-
ward way through Darlinghurst. The graces
had chosen just that hour when Sydney was
emptying its toiling crowds. A policeman
was so staggered that he let the trio pass,
then changed his mind, pursued them and
took down some names. Unperturbed, the
lightly-clad visions of delight boarded a Bondi
tram, and disappeared. Logically it is no
doubt as justifiable to appear in surf attire in
Darlinghurst as at Coogee; but if the limits
of undressing extend, Gwendoline, intending
to seek the cool waves at Coogee directly the
office closes, may come to her typewriter on
Saturday morning clad only in a Canadian
two-piece, a beach-robe and' a smile.
“Ther house is orlrite,” said the gentle-
man from Outback to the agent, “but I don’t
like ther ’leotric light.” “Ah, but the elec-
tric light is so clean and so restful to the
eyes,” replied the rent-catcher. “Yairs, may
be, mister; but when it comes ter ’untin’
insec’s at night, yer can’t beat a candle.”
A Brisbane postscript:—
The G.-G., with military sec. Capt. Mulholland as
a flanking party, arrived on the 17th and put up at
Government House. On the 22nd Lord Digby and
his spouse, with Lady Belper and the hon. Venetia
Digby, appeared, but they boarded the Yoshino Maru
four days later, bound for Japan.
After the Poster Cup yacht races, Col. Cameron
lunched the G.-G. and Sir Matt, with their two
captains and Michael Rogers, at the Queensland
Club, from which cheery spot the vice-regals went
on to the Museum. They were handed the cup that
doesn’t inebriate at the Longmans, and in the even-
ing the Government House board was spread for
the Premier and Mrs. Theodore, Judge and Mrs.
McCawley, the Glyn Connollys and O’Beirnes, Gor-
don Galls, Hawthorns, and others favored of the
gods, with Capt. Harry Hammond and the G.-G.'s
own Captain to round things off.
Sir Matt gave a luncheon pai'ty in honor of
Lord Forster, and several generals, colonels and cap-
tains, with their wives and three plain misters, were
bidden to the feast.
Ex-tramways Badger and his wife farewelled Mrs.
Jim Forsythe among silver vases of pink and
white roses and a lattice of asparagus fern starred
with pale pink and rose-hued asters.
A recent law suit showed the company that is staging
“Brewster’s Millions” at the new Theatre Royal
to be in no particular want, seeing that it is mak-
ing a profit of a thousand a month nett. Who
said comedy and drama were duds in Brisbane?
A ship came home full of red roses at the
bidding of the George Darvalls to farewell the
McNab and Stewart ladies, who are off to the Cold
Country. The Cecil Palmers were among those
who sniffed the blooms.
John McDonnell, son and heir to Dr. Aeneas, of
Toowoomba, has been staying at the Governor’s mia-
mia.
Alexander Morgan went out after a long illness
at his home on Dornoch-terrace the other day. He
had been connected with Allan and Starks for 24
years, was a director for half that time, and two
years ago married Madge Brown, one of the staff.
A good Scotchbyterian. Dr. A. P. Ross, died the day
after Mr. Morgan.

The 20th Futurity Stakes drew a huge
crowd to Caulfield on Saturday. A cloudy
day tempted the fashion-followers to
autumn frocks, but they pouted when they
found themselves sweltering in steamy heat.
The newest gowns were very warm. Added
to the frock itself are gigantic sleeves and
collars that turn into capes. The once-
adored angel-sleeves are in again, only the
unwieldy things are now made of “dress-
stuff.” Another striking innovation is the
baggy, loose Mandarin coat. One advanced
female wore such a coat of Paisley silk, and
it hung over a tight sheath skirt oj| like
material. Horrified onlookers thought she
had come out in her ’jamas.
Some sensible frockers appeared in sum-
mer clothes. Lady Stradbroke wore cool
sea-green georgette, with white shoes and
socks. A tawny tulle scarf, decorated with
hibiscus blooms, was wound loosely round
her shoulders, and she added a further bril-
liant; color note to her costume by a strik-
ing hat of liibiscus-red straw. Mrs. Pitt
Rivers wore a soft georgette gown of very dark
navy that left off an inch from the ground.
Mrs. Sam Mackay was in a lovely black
cr£pe dress, trimmed at the edges with the
fashionably-ragged monkey fur. Mrs.
Staughton. in ivory-white organdie, had a
blue hat shrieking with stiff scarlet feathers.
Mrs. Jack Winter Irving had a closely-knitted
dress of thick navy silk. Mrs. Earl, in
blue, brought daughter-in-law Mrs. Elliot
Murray, who was in cool white and black
foulard. Mrs. Harry Whiting sported cool
lavender muslin and a big black hat, and
Mrs. Allan Tye showed a glimpse of exquisite
fawn footgear under a neat navy foulard
frock. Mardi Syme’s dress had bougain-
villaea peeping through a lattice of navy cloth,
and a pinky-purple felt was pulled down
over her dark curly hair. Diana Wilson
caused a sensation in a sand-colored, flimsy
frock and hat, vivid red coral ear-rings hang-
ing as far as her smooth shoulders, and a
coral-red race-bag in the crook of her arm.
Our Earl with his lady and the eldest
flapper are to sail by the Narkunda on March
31. The State Cabinet will wish his Ex.
bon voyage at a lunch at Parliament House
on March 27. To quieten rumors that he
might remain in Britain when he got there,
Stradbroke told the Diggers’ Association the
other day that he was coming back to finish
his term.
Nearly all that is best-dressed and better-
looking m Melbourne’s really musical world
rallied to the Dorothy Murdoch concert at
the Town Hall. A sort of vice-regal recep-
tion was achieved on behalf of Lady Forster
by the device of holding up the concert until
she arrived and then netting everybody to
stahd up for Godsave on the piano. Ex.-
Gaud Hennessv appeared to be chief usher
to the Government House party, and the
Dyers; gave a musical tint to the vice-regal
reserve below the platform. The greeting
Alberto Telman received was warmer than
Dorothy got in her turn, and ever so much
warmer than Brownlee, the baritone, had
been encouraged with when he started the
programme. But eventually his big .manly
voice and unpretentious smile won all hearts,
and Melba’s protege was the most popular
pebble on the beach. Dorothy bore herself
gracefully in a smart white net frock
trimmed with hundreds of little green
sequins that produced a glass-beady effect.
As regards material, though, the star’s out-
fit was outshone by the little pianist-girl,
whose clinging satin skirt was topped by a
gold-brocaded bodice, which somehow seemed
to account by its costliness for the appear-
ance of so raw a performer as a piano solo-
ist. Very interesting was the reminder of
Melba that Dorothy Murdoch introduced into
her French songs. Melba’s accent has a
distinctive tang, and of all the imitations
one gets on the platform Dorothy’s is the
truest.
The daughter of a late Ghief Justice and
Lieut.-Governor, who is a matron of about
two years’ standing, has her share of avoir-
dupois—as the French put it, she has “too
many people on the balcony.” Over the
clatter of teacups at a women’s club t’other
afternoon she was chaffed about her predilec-
tion for Oscar Asche’s productions. “My
dears,” she explained, “it isn’t so much
Asche’s acting—he makes me feel so slim.”
Another Western District dollar princess,
Joyce Russell (Mrs. George Blackwood’s
elder chick), is going back to the Fog which
she inhaled during the war years as a school-
girl. She will be under the wing of her
aunt, the Alan Currie matron, and is
to make her bob at the first Royal parlor.
Joyce’s absence will leave a gap among the
Girl Guides, for she is one of the few who
learned her Guiding in England. In any
case the movement isn’t making a partic-
ularly enthusiastic noise. The recent
encampment in the Vice-regal Macedon park
lands was rather frostily peopled with a bare
30, instead of the desired hundreds.
Nevinson Faulkner, the eldest hope of the
late Sunbury medico, has persuaded Helen
Alsop, of Bairnsdale, to fix a date with him.
The Faulkner widow, with daughter Marcia,
is now sheltering in the Eric Harrisons’
Toorak place, which she has hired while
the owners keep burglars out of the W. J.
T. Clarkes’ grey house higher up the hill.
A beauty competition often results in
something more tiian a money prize. At a
competition held towards the end of last
year in New York, the judges were Harri-
son Fisher, Henry Hutt and Clive O’Hara,
the last the son of a’former brilliant Mel-
bourne surgeon. The first prize was won by
Helen Cunningham. Within a month she
and Clive were married. Clive is a singu-
larly gifted person. As a youth he became
a professional conjurer. Later he won suc-
cess as an actor. Then he went into part-
nership with Charlie Chaplin’s brother as
a “movie” producer. At 40 he is one of New
York’s successful painters—landscape and
portrait.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer asked Music Associa-
tion members to come along to her Toorak
homestead, Kinnoul, the other night, to wel-
come the Zelman pair, back from a 12-
months’ survey of musical Europe, and artist
Tom Roberts and Mrs. Tom, who have just
brought their paint-boxes back to the wattle.
Mrs. Jimmy was radiant in golden brocaded
drapery; Mrs. Zelman was in pink chiffon
under a lofty crown of massed pink berries,
and the artist’s lady mainly in black. Harold
Browning warbled before supper, and among
those who ate were the Barrett knight and
his pleasing dame, musical Dr. Rudall and
his other half, the aldermanic Cabenas, Dr.
Stewart and his handsome wife, big George
Allen and sister Adelaide, Millie Tree Chap-
man and her husband, little Fritz Hart,
Sutton Crow and other musical experts;
also ex-Digger Mcßeath, who wrote “Yarra-
wonga” and has now booked a passage to the
Heather, where he hopes to turn out a more
weighty type of song.
The pretty wife of Jimmy Burns, who was
Vida Mills, of Melbourne, is signalled as
arriving on the incoming Narkunda. She
and her husband dashed to London to the
sick bed of James Gowan Brae Burns, and
evidently the delectable daughter-in-law has
Coued him, for, though the young couple
spent only 10 day s in London, S’James is
now sitting up quite cheerily in a chair on
the Narkunda’s deck.
Arthur Cooke, a Toorak exquisite who,
after moulting his birdman’s plumage, trans-
ferred to Sydney, handed his pals a surprise
last week by marrying Kitty Deane, from
the Harbor City, at the Camberwell Anglican
Church. The affair had been kept so secret
that even the engagement had not been an-
nounced. The bride’s parents convoyed their
daughter to Melbourne for the event, and the
bridegroom’s mother (the widow of the Rev.
Reginald Cooke, of Bright), just back from
two years in the Sydney sunshine, was there
to witness the swearing-in of her daughter-
in-law.
Rembrandt has caught here little Zoe Ali-
son in contemplative mood. The 19-year-old
singer was modestly
training her agile
fingers when Theo
Roberts, on a vocal
prospecting expedi-
tion, discovered in
her an unusually
beautiful voice. This
will be shortly aired
in musical comedy.
The damsel has just
a sweet stage ap-
pearance, and is
otherwise equipped
for the work. Her
diction has been edu-
cat e d, and Jennie
Brenan has trained
her shapely under-
standings to swift
and graceful move-
ment. Zoe got her
baptism of limelight in Music Week as star
singer at half-a-dozen different Melbourne
civic halls. Since when she has been getting
further experience on a country concert
tour.
Mrs. Alec Hay, accompanied by her
Dresden-shepherdess complexion and Polaire-
like waist, drifted back to Melbourne by the
Ormonde. Her husband. ex-M.H.R. Alec,
came over from Sydney to greet her at the
gangway. The lady seems to have inherited
the gift of perennial youth like her mother,
the Sydney Burdekin dame.
Racing Secretary Byron Moore’s two
girls, Mrs. Ronald Gordon and little sister
Grace, with boxes of summer chiffons, left
on the Yoshino Maru. They will step off
at Manila and then saunter through the
“Far East.”
An earnest committee has been formed in
Melbourne, with Jimmy Dyer as treasurer
and Austin Bastow, the art architect, as
chairman, to foster and encourage the George
Dancey Memorial Exhibition, a scheme for
benefiting the deceased artist’s family, left
badly provided for. The idea is to get about
200 artists in Melbourne and Sydney to con-
bute a picture apiece and to sell a corres-
ponding number of tickets at two guineas
each. When the exhibition is held ticket-
holders will draw for the order in which they
will select each a picture from the walls. By
this means it is assumed that no ticket-
holder will get less than his money’s worth,
and many will draw quite considerable prizes.
The method is deemed advisable by reason
of the extraordinary slump in the picture
market rendering the prospeets of a sales
exhibition very dubious.
A quaint triangle causes some grim
amusement in one of Melbourne’s lesser
social whirlpools. With a new-wives-for-old
plan in his mind the man tripped over to
the U.S. and put through some sort of local
divorce. Then, also in the U.S., he married
an Australian girl and the pair came back to
the Yarra-side. Nowadays, whenever there
is a snivoo at which new-wife is to be pre-
sent, old-wife attends and hisses ungentle
sneers, as publicly as possible, into the
brightly-burning ear of her supplanter—and
into the crimson ear of himself, too, if him-
self happens to be handy. The ex-wife pro
bably gets her money’s worth, but it seems
a wearing sort, of business.
Melbourne will miss a dour old Scot in
D. 'Campbell, its superintendent of street
plantations, now to retire by effluxion of
time, though he is not nearly so old as some
of the Bumbles who are ruling him out.
Campbell has scattered rockeries and shrub-
beries all over the city, and the speed with
which he transformed St. Paul’s Cathedral
front into something green and presentable as
soon as he got hold of it was a new joy for
all concerned —particularly the mean church
crowd who shifted the burden to other
people’s shoulders.
Dr. Hugh Lewers has signalled from
North Borneo to say he is marrying in
April with Coral Horton, only daughter of
a Civil Service big-gun in that far-away
spot. The ’groom-to-be finished his A.I.F.
service with D.S.O. and 0.8. E. ribbons
gladdening his colonel’s tunic. He is one of
the late Tom Lewers’s tribe, who pegged out
a patch on the St. Kilda road.
This is how Rembrandt’s camera saw
Noel, of the tennis-playing Heath brothers,
who lately bagged the
South Yarra Club
Championship. But
the young man does
not confine his activi-
ties to smashing rub-
ber balls across a net.
He is equally expert
with a saxophone,
tootling the instru-
ment as soulfully as
jazz melody will per-
mit, in the Prince’s
Club Amateur Or-
chestra, which keeps
the best sassiety busy
each Friday night on
the Anzac House ball
floor. The Amateur
players, by the way,
are all old Melbur-
mans: Ednc Henty wields the baton, and a
Weston Pett, Bill Fanning and Noel Heath
are in the band.
Anne Williams appears to be making good
in England. She has as yet made only a few
appearances, but the critics have enthused
over the peculiar charm of her folk songs,
and the lyric quality of her voice. Anne was
accepted as a great teacher in Melbourne to
the exclusion of sincere consideration of her
quality as a performer. _ She was thought to
have a rather nice voice, whereas for the
special work she adopted there had been
none—with the possible exception of Dolores
—to equal her for sheer charm. If she comes
back the enthusiasm of Old World critics
will perhaps help her to her rightful place
in her own country.
The Castles girls and boys are nearly all
home with mother for the first time in many
months, and the family piano is working
overtime. “George is only our manager,”
pouts Eileen, “but he grabs the piano for
hours every day practising his own voice.”
There are three younger brothers all showing
signs of following the musical bent of Amy,
Eileen, Dolly and George, and now Dolly
Finn’s three-year-old daughter is declared to
be developing a wonderfully correct “ear.”
Frank, a 14-year-old Castles, has a very
pure tenor, but is yet shy of public appear-
ance. The Amy-Eileen concerts begin in
the Town Hall to-night (Thursday).
When he was a youngster of 28 James
Venn Morgan came to Vic. in 1851 from a
Somersetshire village. Two years later he
settled in Kew. which was then “out in the
bush.” and built the first house there. lie
is still there, and passed his century last
week.
The other day Dr. Poison, the Ballarat
College headmaster, handed his younger chick
Linda over to Harold Austin, youngest hope
of the Geelong medico. It happened at St.
Andrew’s. The bride was in white satin
with a brocaded train under folds of ancient
Brussels lace, lent by a Geelong matron,
Mrs. Grey. Cousin Dorothy Langlands-Jack
bridesmaided in fluffy pink with mauve effects
wandering over her wide-brimmed hat.
Brother Herbert was in charge of the bride-
groom. The just-weds are now off on a
honeymoon trip to Japan.
“What is smoodging?” Irvine, C.J., asked
in a case before him in the Criminal Court
the other day. The witness, who was half-
way between girlhood and womanhood, told
’S’onah that she used the term as meaning
nothing more or less than cuddling. “That’s
a good old English word,” commented the
Iceberg, thawing slightly, and the case went
on. The sticklers for accuracy were too em-
barrassed to explain to Irvine that a
smoodger is one who ingratiates himself with
a view to favors to come.
Melbourne City Council, which spent a
few thousands in the law courts to find out
what any junior clerk in the Public Works
Department could have told it —that it had
» power to prohibit street parades—doesn’t
know quite what to do with applications with
regard to St. Patrick’s Day and Eight Hours
Day. After drifting about rudderless on a
sea of discussion, the corporation asked the
Legislative Committee, for Heaven’s sake,
to take the blessed problem and solve it
somehow. But no matter what the decision
is, the processions will be held.
Pat O’Hara Wood is not going to worry
along in the legal footsteps of his father and
maternal grandfather (the late Justice
Holroyd). He is about to commercialise his
sporting knowledge as head of a sports depot
in Collins-street. Various articles on tennis
which have spurted from his facile J nib
suggest that he could further supplement his
takings with jaunts along the Inky Way.
Pat’s late father, under the pen-name of
“R. Iv. Dee,” published a novel and showed a
graceful turn for versification.
A note from a Sydneysider:—
The idea that Victoria can produce a surfing-beach
equal to the best in the Ma State would be scoffed
at by the average Sydney-sider. To be disillusion-
ised, he is invited to Lome, on the south-west coast,
about 100 miles from Melbourne. In addition to
some very fine forest scenery, threaded by clear
mountain streams with picturesque waterfalls, Lome
possesses a white and level beach nestling under the
hills, where the breakers roll to the shore in an
even sweep that rejoices the heart of the surf-
shooter. Incidentally, one of the leading boarding-
houses here is credited with leading more pairs
of feet to the edge of the enticing surf of matri-
mony than any other similar establishment in Vic-
toria.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
The fires in the hills came within an ace of de-
molishing the John Barkers’ picturesque home at the
Summit, threatened the Tom Barr Smiths’ and the
Higham Wiggs’ gardens at Aldgate, swept through
the Michael Hawkers’ pinfes, and at the Julian Bar-
clays’ place left nothing much more than the house.
The Barclays’ was one of the best-known nursery
gardens in the hills, famed under little Mrs. Caley
Smith’s management for its gladioli and carnations
and dahlias, and since her death run by its present
owners. Mrs. Barclay is one of the Magareys, and
her married life had been spent in America till, a
year or two ago, she and her husband decided
to exchange farming in the U.S. for flower-culture
in the hills where so many of her people have lived.
Meanwhile Adelaide had its biggest fire for years
when the motor-warehouse of Duncan and Fraser, behind
the G.P.0., went up in flames the other morning.
There was a great holocaust, mostly of Fords, and
nothing could be done to save them. The tall
building of the Farmers’ Union alongside was saved
by its sprinklers; but, when the motor place’s
store of petrol at the back exploded, the flames
went clean through other buildings of the Farmers’
Co., and came out to a side street. The damage is
estimated at £200,000.
The Kindergarten and Montessori College in North
. Adelaide opened itself for this year’s work with a
tea party, at which the joint principals, Miss
Burgess and Miss King, were hostesses, and Mrs. J.
P. Morice and Mrs. McGlew said a word or two
anent the value of kindergarten work. Incidentally,
Miss Fisken and her sister, here from Melbourne
on a visit, and keen kindergarteners in their own
State, did a round of our schools and pronounced
them excellent.
Our Trades and Labor Council considers the class
system on railway lines undemocratic, and has
unanimously decided to ask the Chief Commis-
sioner to abolish it —but (for some unstated reason)
only on the suburban lines, run in competition with
tramcars, which never dream of making class dis-
tinctions, anyway. The public is paving the way
for a change by the practical step of crowding into
the Second class and letting the first run empty.
The birth ad. takes a new and embarrassing form
in the Advertiser (14/2/’23) : —-
On the 4th February, at 17 High-street, Kensing-
ton, to Mr. and Mrs. a daughter (Shirley).
Dr. and Nurse in attendance. Both well.
In this case the linotype doubtless printed what was ,
given it; but it has to accept the blame for two
other recent ’Tiser ads., one of which added “a
son” to an engagement notice, while the other
ruined an otherwise touching In Memoriam tribute
with an added line “About £3OO. Inspection
invited.”

Miss MONA CLIVE, a
beautiful Rexona Girl, of
89 Victoria Street , Potts
Point, N.S.W., who says
she finds Rexona Soap
simply par excellent for
her Skin and Hair.
Why Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion?
You cannot if 3m udo not care for the delicate skin of the face. When you wash your
face do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the dirt, but that your
skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from
blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as
you are well aware.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the skin,
but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure Soap, but is medicated oh
the same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment, which is famous throughout all of
Australasia as the Rapid Healer. That is why Rexona Soap really does for the skin and
face what cosmetics are supposed to do, by ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure
and healthy skin, and thus gives you a clear complexion.
Girls! Beautify Your Hair.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can double
the beauty of your hair? It becomes light, wavy, fluffy,
abundant, and appears as soft, lustrous and charming as
anyone could desire, after a simple wash with Rexona Soap.
A delightful surprise awaits those whose hair has been
neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt or excess
oil, and in a few moments you have doubled the beauty of
your hair. Rexona Soap dissolves every particle of dandruff,
cleanses, purifies and invigorates the scalp, for ever stopping
itching and falling hair. If you care to have pretty hair, and
lots of it, get a tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.

A NEW DEPARTURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Carpentier and Siki are to meet on September 9.
Each will receive one-twentieth of the gate money,
the other nine-tenths going towards scientific research.
The punch on the snout
Or'*.the point of the chin
To Art, beyond doubt
Was always akin.
Now France makes it handmaid to Science — le com-
bat a coups de poing.
Will the blackamoor beat
Beau George to his knees
Or Carpentier eat
The Senegalese?
Immaterial, surely, compared with the dough that
professors will seize.
Here pugilists clash
Each week in the ring
For the lucre —the cash
In the purse and the “jing”
Of the gate. But in Paris the cultured they’ve
altered all that sort o’ thing.
’Neath the usual clouts
They will stagger and lurch,
But the goriest bouts
Might be blessed by the Church
When the strapping’s to amplify knowledge and
aid scientific research.
No more there’ll be jeers
From the highbrows above
At cauliflower ears
And such marks of the glove.
What nobler .to own than a mug that’s been bashed
to give learning a shove?
The hopes of the white
And the black, I’ll be bound,
Each spoiling for fight
On the day will be found,
Albeit their whack of the takings is only a bob in
the pound.
Five per cent, of the gate
Is their cut from the fray.
That’s the cablegram straight
And —what’s that you say?
Well, boss, it may answer at Paris, but it wouldn t
at Rushcutter’s Bay.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
It was a pleasure to see Eurythm c so far
re-assert himself in the Futurity at Caulfield as to
nearly repeat his 10.7 victory of last year, when
Wish Wvnne finished second to the old cham-
pion. This time the Sydney mare ran moderately
under her big weight, whilst Eurythmic, coming
from behind with his belated run, beat everything
bar Salatis, to whom he was giving a stone. It
was almost as good as his performance of a year
ago (the time was considerably faster), but the
very nature of that run, made necessary by lus
lateness in getting away from the barrier, empha-
sised the fact that a lot of stake money lias
been lost to Eurythmic’s owner by the tactical
error last season of trying to make a sprinter
of the noble animal instead of leaving him to
follow the devices of his own legs. Apparently
the gallop over 9 furlongs on the previous Satur-
day, when Easingwold beat him,- did the “freak’
horse good. Or, maybe, it was nasty _ tamper
that kept Eurythmic from making his anticipated
effort in the St. George Stakes, whereas the
Futurity caught him in a more amiable mood. Eas-
ingwold carried money this time, and ran no-
where, the great surprise of the race being Cas-
erta, who started as as Eurythmic, yet
finished a highly respectable third, under the bur-
den of 9.3. Maid of the Mist was placed fourth.
She ought to win a race shortly. _
At a difference of 121 b. Prince Cox beat Sister
Olive in good style for the 11-furlong Woodcliffe
Handicap. Nevertheless positions are likely to be
reversed in the Australian Cup. Prince Cox, on
his Randwick form, locks fully equal to the dis-
tance ; still, there is a doubt, which doesn’t exist
in Sister Olive’s case. The mare will meet him on
slightly better terms, and because she has run
improvingly of late, and is a bigger and stronger-
looking woman than when she ran second as a
three-year-old, with only 111 b. less to carry, the
writer, without reckoning her a real good thing,
would sooner back Sister Olive, win and place,
than anything else. ....
Last year the result of the Newmarket was fore-
shadowed when Rostrum beat heavily-backed Dun-
wil for the Hawksburn Handicap at Caulfield. On
Saturday St. Speed snapped the same “trial’ race
from All Serene, who showed good form in beating
Salatis over six furlongs a fortnight earlier. A 1
three must be respected for the Newmarket. All
Gold, after being one of the leaders, finished
nowhere, and though the defeat of the Sydney flier
was by no means conclusive, one has to pay atten-
tion to it. St. Speed is likely to beat All Gold
again at Flemington; also, big Salatis should win
the Newmarket outright if he is among the first
four at three furlongs. But probably the speedy
son of Shepherd King and Traquette will not be so
nimble as all that. Scorpius is still an unknown
quantity on Melbourne courses, and Easingwold
thus far has not shaped like a sprinter. Moreover,
his failure in the Futurity was discouraging. There
are the three placed horses in the Oakleigh Plate
to be accounted for—Chelidon, Sunburst and De-
metrius not to mention Weedah, who ran Sunburst
to a neck in the Standish Handicap on New Year’s
Day. The last-named may have been unlucky to
lose the Oakleigh, as owner Connolly thinks he was,
but even though Sunburst comes out just as ripe
and ready for the Newmarket as he was a fort-
night back, he will have nothing to spare. With
luck, Sunburst should certainly finish in the first
five; but of all the highly probable ones he looks
least likely to win comfortably. The writer would
prefer Weedah on a wet day, anyhow, and in any
weather the sturdy mare will be a reasonable place
investment. As regards Demetrius (who made a
lot of running in the Futurity ere he ran wide at
the turn) there can be no doubt he is fit, and
kindly handicapped on his best three-year-old form.
Perhaps he is the sort that prefers a course with a
turn in it to the straight six at Flemington, but if
given the benefit of the doubt on that point De-
metrius, at the present moment, seems a more rea-
sonable fancy than even Weedah, or the others
mentioned. Therefore this paper tips Demetrius and
Sister Olive for the double.
* *
“Fax” : Within the past 12 years seven placed
horses in the Caulfield Futurity Stakes have been
placed in the Newmarket a week later, whilst several
others have been placed in both events, but in dif-
ferent years. Broadsword, who won the Doncaster
Handicap in the April, had previously run second
for the Futurity and third for the Newmarket. Next
year Desire was runner-up in the Futurity and win-
ner of the Newmarket. Cider, second in both races
in 1914, had been third in the Futurity the previous
year. Blague won the Newmarket after running
third for the Futurity, whereas the order of pro-
cedure was reversed in Wedge’s case. Sir Ibex and
Greenstead were placed second and third in both
races in 1919. Sir Ibex was placed third in the
Futurity next year, when Whiz Bang finished second,
and two years later Whiz Bang came second to
Rostrum in the Newmarket. The form shown in the
seven-furlong race at Caulfield has often been worth
following at Flemington on the following Saturday,
but on the other hand there have been such as
Comedy King (once a winner, and twice third, in
the Futurity), Blairgour, Brattle, Flash of Steel,
Maharajah and Gold Tie, that found the New-
market six-furlongs either too straight, or too short,
for them.
“0.K.” : Trying to pick the winner of the
Newmarket this year, a week or two in advance of
the event, has been a barely reasonable job on ac-
count of the exceptional dry ness of the season. At
time of writing a deluge was more than merely
overdue in Melbourne, and a race run in a quagmire
is almost certain to be an upset of form. What
is true as regards a Newmarket run on a sticky
course is even more true when the Australian Cup
happens during a wet spell. Weather seems likely
to be on the side of the books this coming V.R.C.
meeting.
“Tren”: A true sportsman was William
Reid, just dead at 80. Before Uncle Sam won
the Caulfield Cup for the secbnd time, a Northcote
syndicate were notified that they had drawn that
horse in Tattersall’s. Knowing that most owners
demanded a substantial cut from sweep-winners, they
telegraphed Reid an offer of £lOOO to nothing. In
reply he expressed astonishment that anyone should
so mistake his principles as to offer him money
to do his best; and when the horse won, neither
lie nor his jockey, Ettershank, would take a penny
from the syndicate. Reid was a committeeman of
the Moonee Yalley R. C. from its foundation to the
time of his death. His widow is a daughter of the
late H. N. Simson, who won the second Vic. Derby,
in 1856, with Flying Doe.

“Sucre”: Albion Park (B. 22/2/’23) is
known to the Brisbane “heads” as “the soup-plate.”
Once a huge swamp (P. T., Gannon bought it for
a song) it is now regarded as the safest wet-
weather course in Australia. J. B. Sharpe, Labor
M.11.R. for Oxley in two Parliaments, sold it to
Wren.
JIM ROLAND, conqueror of Colin Bell for
the heavyweight title.
“The Mug”: The morals of the West-
ralian turf are to be discussed in the courts. On
the complaint of P. A. Connolly, the local Cup-
farmer, that his horse Propagation had been pre-
vented from winning a race at the Christmas meet-
ing and incidentally landing a £2500 wager, Tommy
Darcy, a jockey, was disqualified for five years. Darcy
gave notice of appeal, but replied with a writ instead,
and, meanwhile, the owner of Jolly Cosy has been
obliged to apologise for certain references- to the
stipendiary stewards while the inquiry was in pro-
gress. Connolly is a great judge of horseflesh,
and as far as money goes there is no more charit-
able man in the West, but he has a poor opinion
of the horse-flogging fraternity. He once told a
reporter that he had never employed a jockey that
hadn’t “taken him on.” Darcy owns a twisted limb,
the result of a bad accident in a Perth handicap.
He came into the limelight years ago by riding
through the wilds of Kimberley to reach a brother’s
deathbed. Desperately ill, the brother had been
operated on by the local postmaster (no doctor
being available) in accordance with instructions
telegraphed from Perth. The operation, considering
the circumstances, was performed with wonderful
skill, but it came too late.
Colin Bell, the bald-headed bruiser who
used to drive bullocks at Moree (N.S.W.) and now
steers taxis at Sydney, lost his heavyweight title
on Saturday to Jim Roland, a rugged 13-stoner.
Bell is old enough to be Roland’s father, but he
was streets ahead on points till the 12th round,
when the pace began to tell on the hairless ancient.
At the beginning of the 13th, Roland got Bell in
a corner and banged away until he was tired of
punching. Then he stepped back and Bell blindly
staggered across the ring, and through the rones.
Yanked back by willing and unfriendly hands,
Colin dazedly put ’em up again, but he was gone,
and the referee crowned Roland.
* * * * *
In two great races at Wellington (M.L.)
Morris Kirksey, the U.S. sprinter, proved a shade
too good for the Australian champion, E. W. Carr.
Kirksey won by inches in the 100yds., run in
9 4-ssee. ; in the 220yds., covered in 21 4-ssee., his
advantage was a yard. Considering that the track
was a bit on the sodden side, the times were exception-
ally fast and there is evidently very little between
the pair. Carr handsomely admits the Californian’s
superiority, but there is a suggestion that “Slip’s”
condition failed him over the last bit of the 220,
in which, after passing Kirksey 50yds. from home,
he failed to maintain his spurt. lie is built on
generous lines, and is a youngster who enjoys life,
wherefore he would take more time to get over the
boat-trip than a sprinter of the greyhound type. In
any case Carr proved himself quite first-class, and,
trained to the minute, he will give Paddock and
Kirksey a great go at the Olympic games. In
the other contests F. Merchant (U.S.A.) won the
javelin throw (155 ft.), the hammer throw (169 ft. lOin.
- —-Australasian record), and the shot put (45ft.
2in.) ; and lvrogness took the 120yds. hurdles in
15 3-ssec. It was America’s day out.
If the lady sprint “champion” of Victoria
is not taken seriously by this continent in gen-
eral the fault is not hers. Last week, after defeat-
ing an aspiring challenger, Mrs. Baddock dared any
woman in Australia to come forward and try her
legs at 50, 65 and 75 yards. In her recent out-
ings at Maribyrnong the speedy matron scored only
two out of three. She lost the 50 yards to Mis's
Tucker, who is trained locally. But since winning
the rubber Mrs. Baddock has challenged her rival
to another 50-yards sprint, and the promoters
will probably induce the other lady to take up the
gauntlet. They run very well, uncommonly well—
for women. But seeing how few women have ever
thought of trying to be sprinters, the question
arises as to whether a dozen girls couldn’t be
chosen from the various ballets and choruses to
beat Mrs. B. for speed and stamina. Talk of
medical objection to women running races up to
75 yards is surely ridiculous, in face of the fact
that some of them run about for hours on the
tennis court and jazz their male partners silly in
the ballroom.
* * * *
“Matahari”: Arthur Baynes, Australia’s
best amateur sculler, retained his Queensland title
by decisively defeating J. G. Smith, of Bundaberg,
over two miles in 12min. 50sec. Another sculler in
form is the pro. Billy McDevitt, who won the mile
handicap at the Leichhardt (N.S.W.) regatta, from
the scratch mark. McDevitt is a Digger. Come
to think of it, the Digger is not so prominent in
sport as most of us were predicting about Armistice
time. In cricket he is well represented, with
Gregory, Macartney, Kelleway, Collins, Taylor, Pel-
lew and others; in tennis there are Patterson and
O’Hara Wood ;• and Carr, who saw service in Pales-
tine, is doing famously on the grass track. But
the acknowledged Australian champions in most
branches of sport—l am not saving it was their
fault —kept the home fires burning in 1914-18.
* * - *
A crowd of 30.000 watched the inter-State
motor-boat tests on Adelaide’s Outer Harbor, but
the affair was a dreadful fiasco. As a result of the
confused proceedings the local boat Tortoise, owned
bv the Rymill brothers, still ranks as the fastest
craft in the Commonwealth, and in the little open
racing that occurred she gave the Sydney flier
Meteor a good view of her stern. But accidents
spoilt everything. In the first heat Tortoise led
all the way, Meteor having to slow down in the
third of ten two-mile laps. The second heat was
getting interesting when Meteor rammed Tortoise,
disabling her so badly that she had to withdraw
from the contest. Meteor was also damaged, but
kept going, and finished second to Milliwa. In the
third heat Meteor beat Miss Brisbane, Milliwa
having retired owing to engine trouble; and the
fourth heat was a walk-over for the Sydney boat.
But after taking two days to think things over, the
committee declared it “no race” ; and, speaking
out "Of a. full heart, Major Donkin announced that
he would never compete in South Oss again. None
of the boats did better than 48.2 m.p.h., albeit
Tortoise, which carries a 450-h.p. Liberty engine,
has registered 57 m.p.h. in trials.

An inspiriting series of races in Moreton
Bay -O.) resulted in Nettle, pride of Sydney’s 21ft.
restricted-class fleet, adding the Forster Cup to the
impressive lot of trophies she has assembled this
season. Nettle, skippered by her owner, W. E.
Arnott, annexed the first and second heats, the local
yacht Miss Brisbane chasing her home on both
occasions, and the luckless Corella, with the G.-G.
at the tiller, being twice third. However, Miss
Brisbane took the last heat in excellent style, and
but for an error of judgment on Norman Wright’s
part in the first test, in which Nettle’s advantage,
at the end of a strenuous 12-mile race, was only
two lengths, the cup would probably be in the
R.Q.Y.C.’s possession. There is very little between
the two yachts or their captains.
Although Maoriland hasn’t a Beaurepaire
or a Charlton, or anyone within coo-ee of their
form, the present lot of Australian girl swimmers
are not in the same class as Gwitha Shand, Violet
Walrond and Paula Hoeft. This was amply de-
monstrated during the Sydney tests. In the 220vds.
Australian championship Miss Shand and Miss Wal-
rond had the finish to themselves, Gwitha winning by
6yds., with Mina Wylie a faw third. Th ®
2min. 54 3-ssec., was 3 3-ssec. outside Fanny Dur-
ack’s best. In the quarter-mile Gwitha took the
plunge with the intention of fracturing her Hono-
lulu record of 6min. 14 2-ssec. This she accom-
plished with 5 l-ssec. to the good, and she also won
the race by Byds. from Violet, with the persistent
Mina 25yds. away third. It was a splerrfid per-,
formance on pretty Gwitha s part, for at Honolulu
she turned 16 times as against three times on Sntui-
day. In the re-swum 50yds. junior champion-hi,,
Vera Pawley, a beautifully-moulded kid of Ij , beat
Ettie Robertson fairly and squarely in the record
breaking time of 30 l-ssec. Another popular vic-
tory was that of Elsie Venning, the shapely Queens-
lander, in the 100yds. breaststroke, her fourth suc-
cessive win in this event.
At Adelaide, by beating H. A. Calnan (S.A.) and
L. Uren (Vic.) in the 100yds. backstroke, Keith
Kirkland won the Kieran Memorial Shield for
NSW The Ma State finished with a total ot o

\s a result of Saturday’s matches Gordon
and Wnverlev lead in the Sydney grade competition
with 27 points apiece.
North Sydney have 26.
Mosman 24 and Mar-
rickville 23 ; the other

338 proved 99 too
many for Mosman,
though when the latter
had 4 down for 168
and five of their best
batsmen to come they
seemed to have the
game in hand. Mac-
artney (3 for 41) and
Dive (5 for 108)
wrought the damage.

one of the English-
men who raised the
ire of M.L. writers
on cricket.
Snow”: But it was never conclusively
proved that Jack Marsh, the abo. fast bowler (B.
15/2/’23), threw the ball. Marsh always resented
the imputation, and once demonstrated his ability
to rock ’em in with his arm in splints. True, one
umpire had a habit of no-balling him, but I have
seen the black bowl unchallenged from • the op-
posite end. Marsh’s exclusion from big cricket
was due to causes unconnected with the allegation
that he threw.
##*:<#
When Murray and Hill were batting in
S.A.’s second innings against Vie. it looked as if
the Wheat-Staters might win their first match for
donkey’s years. In the end they were beaten by
seven wickets. Hill’s re-appearance as a player
and Giffen’s as a beneficiary set old cricketers talking
of the best XI the State ever had. Beyond much
doubt, it was (on paper, at any rate) that which
in November, 1894, beat Stoddart’s English XI
which was about to win three Test matches in five against
all Australia: two Giffens, two Jarvises, Lyons, Blin-
man, Reedman, Darling, Jones, Clem Hill and Dyer.
Of course, like all paper teams, it looks a bit
better than it was, since the mind naturally thinks
of each great name as.at the best. The fact is that
Lyons, A. H. Jarvis, Walter Giffen and Blinman
were all getting near to the end of their career,
while Clem Hill was a mere youngster who went
in late and was thought to have done well in making
20.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: South African cricket
is on the up-grade again, A win each and two draws
was the score when the Afrikanders and the strong
English side entered upon the final Test match, and
the home team had the bad luck to bat at the end
in sections, between showers. Naturally, they lost.
At the last English visit, in 1913-14, England won
four matches, and all by big margins, the other being
drawn. In 1912, in the triangular contest in Eng-
land, the southerners hadn’t a hope against either the
English XI or ours. But, playing at home, they
beat England 3 to 2 in 1909-10, and 4 to 1 in
1905-06. They have only once (in 14 tries) defeated
Australia anywhere; it was on their solitary visit
here in 1910-11, when they lost twice at Sydney and
twice at Melbourne, but won by 39 runs at Adelaide
—a ground on which Australia is usually unconquer-
able.
* * * *
“Vacu” : Maelaren's disrespectful remarks
about M.L. cricket may have been prompted by one of
Dunedin’s difficult jokes. When the Englishmen
were about to visit the Scotch town word was sent
ahead of them that the amatuahs could not possibly
stay at the same pub as the professionals. The local
association saw the point, and booked them at dif-
ferent hotels. But the pros, were sent to a 225.-
per-dav caravanserai, and the lilvwhites to one
five-bob-a-day cheaper.
* * * *
“Ashmead” : His enemies are beginning to
say that Premier J. B. Hayes, of the Speck, is
a better cri< lteter than statesman. Playing for
Bagdad v. Bridgewater J.B. knocked up 58 of Bag-
dad’s 250. There is talk of pitting him against
Buttenshaw, of the N. S. Wales Assembly, in a
single-wicket match.


To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t aliow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles. •
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines —
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain's Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are mild and gentle in their action and
pleasant to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and Dowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.

Bulletin takes your fancy, write to the
Manager, who will quote you price for it.
Missir.g Friends.
ANY PERSON having any information or
knowledge of PETER BELL, brother
of Robert Belh late of Murchison, in
the State of Victoria, Farmer, deceased,
kindly communicate with Messrs. BURT,
STEWART & SON, Solicitors, Rushworth,
Victoria. Peter Bell, if still living, should
be about 70 years of age, and was last heard
,'f 20 vears ago as residing at Malwalwa,
New South Wales.
THE INKY WAY.
The Melbourne dailies have at last announced
“with pleasure’’ a reduction in price. Argus and
Age descend from twopence to three-halfpence on
March 5, and the Herald from March 10 will be
Hd. on Saturdays. It leaves Melbournites still won-
dering how it is Sydney papers manage to pull
through on a penny.
“El Verdugo” : How’s this for a literary coincidence?
In a novel. “Triona,’’ which is just now in the
bookshops, the author-hero marries under a nom
de plume. In Charles Kingsley’s “Two Years Ago,’’
the hero does exactly the same thing. In each
instance the poor idiot boasts the real name of
John Briggs.
“Drifter”: Can anyone tell me why the journalist
is always described as having “drifted into journal-
ism” ? Even Alfred Buchanan, who has lately drifted
out of it and into Costs, makes out (B. 8/2/’23) that
Hazlitt “inevitably drifted” into the game. You
never hear of a man drifting into the pulpit, or the
law. He may drift into a pub, but as a suppliant,
not a licensee. Or into the cemetery, but only
because they put him in a box and carry him there.
“Wm. Street”: Why do policemen always “pro-
ceed” to a place? I wouldn’t mind it so much if
occasionally they would walk or run or motor or
’plane; it would relieve the monotony. But no, they
always proceed. “My name, your Worship, is John
Cyril Hop. I am a constable stationed at Wangle-
gabba. On the morning of the 13th, from informa-
tion received, I proceeded t 0....” And as the
bleary-eyed person in the dock, wearing several con-
victions instead of a collar, listens, it is easy to
guess where he hopes Const. Hop will proceed to
next.
“P.X.” : The aeroplane is having its effect on the
press, too, and that quite apart from its work as a
rapid carrier of photographs, which still can’t be
’phoned or telegraphed. A few years ago it. became
the habit among the big papers to hatch editions for
places away from their home-nest: the New York
Herald and Chicago Tribune started off with Paris
editions, and the London Daily Mail prints special
editions for Manchester* South Wales and Paris. Now
the London paper which didn’t think a Paris edition
worth while sends off an aeroplane with early
impressions of the London edition, and you can (wind
and weather permitting) buy, say, the Daily Telegraph
on the boulevards at seven in the morning—which
is a good deal earlier than the average English
visitor to Paris wants to buy anything except a
little more Sleep.
“Winnie Fairweather”: Frederick T. Macartney, in
his notes on Charles Harpur (B. 25/l/’23), has done
Barron Field an injustice. Never could that con-
ceited worthy have been content to be styled—or
rather to style himself^—“Australia’s second har-
monist.” The lines are:—•
“I first adventure, follow me who list
And be Australia’s second harmonist.”
The booklet, “First Fruits of Australian Poetry,”
comprised only two poems—“ The Kangaroo” and
“Botany Bay Flowers,” was printed for private circu-
lation in 1819, and was reviewed by Charles Lamb
in Leigh Hunt’s Examiner on Jan. 16, 1820. These
“poems,” with others, Field printed in the appendix
to his “Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales;
b.v Several Hands,” published by John Murray in •
1825. Some of the lines on the kangaroo:—
“Kangaroo! Kangaroo!
Thou spirit of Australia,
That redeems from utter failure,
From perfect desolation,
And warrants the creation
Of this fifth part of the earth”....
Reading this, can we wonder at the English con-
temporary’s address to the judge?—
“Thy poems, Barron Field, I’ve read,
And thus adjudge thy meed,
So poor a crop proclaims thy head
A ‘barren field’ indeed!”
“Morehead”: My suburb, an industrial one, sup-
ports two weeklies, one supercilious, the other frankly
“low.” The organ of gentility has been running for
the past 40 years. It is printed on good paper and
contains reports of council meetings (discreetly sub-
edited) and social functions, syndicated stories and
prim gossip. Its reptile contemp. has been in
existence but 12 months. Already it can (and does)
boast a circulation 10 times that of its rival, with
a much bigger advertising turnover. The simple
explanation is that it has taken into account the
psychology of the place. The police-court news is
its main feature: its readers are diligently informed
that Mrs. Smith called Mrs. Brown “a —— so and
so, and a what’s this,” and was fined or.e
pound and costs. The antics of local drunks are
alliteratively headlined, and if something really spicy
turns up the brilliant story of the last council meet-
ing is held over, without a sigh. For the rest, there
is the sporting page, written in the vernacular, and
a weekly allegation of bribery and corruption against
some alderman, carnival promoter or hospital secre-
tary. The latest I heard was that the older paper
had dropped 50 in its circulation —a terrible slump
this in suburban newspaperdom—and that its rival
is shifting into larger quarters.
“L.E.”: A writer’s tools are so simple that there
is seldom any discussion about them. Yet almost
every writer has fads and prejudices on the subject.
H. G. Wells has written for 20 years with a fountain-
pen. Stephen McKenna, J. D. Beresford and Arnold
Bennett have produced their novels with the same
weapon. Others find that the fountain-pen is too
ready, and that the little delays involved in dipping
a pen into the inkpot are all to the writer’s advan-
tage. Many use a pencil, which has the same fatal
facility as the fountain-pen. Victor Dalev could
never compose with a pencil. He needed a pen
and, I fancy, purple ink. The color of the ink
has an importance to certain writers. This is • not
as absurd as it may seem, for colors have definite
suggestive powers, and the wrong color can upset
a man’s psychological balance. Some writers dic-
tate to a shorthand expert, but these are probably
leader-writers or politicians, or popular novelists
who are in a hurry. In America the latest method
is to speak a short story into a dictaphone, then
take out the plug, and have it written in shorthand
as it unwinds itself, then typed, then carried down
town and sold at five cents a word, almost in one
continuous process. But it takes genius, probably
American genius, to do that. In most cases the
typewriter replaces the older tools nowadays ; but
I still envy and wonder at the man who can com-
pose right on to the machine. The noise is dis-
tracting; and how the deuce can he remodel a
phrase! Modern improvements have done mole harm
than good to the trade. After all, the best w'ork
we know was written with a goose quill.

“LOMAX” Lamp Holders
(Patent 178661)
WIRED IN LESS THAN HALF THE TIME.
CiU
METHOD OF FIXING.
1. Cap and top ring are passed up flexible
cord, bared ends of which are passed
upwards through small holes in porcelain
interior.
2. Heads of terminals are raised by thumb
and finger, at same time releasing spring
pull by pressing plungers upwards.
3. Bared wires are coiled round pins under
heads, which on being released grip wires
against porcelain.
4. Flexible cords are then passed upwards
through axial slots, liner is brought over
into position, and cap screwed down firmly
by means of top ring.
hĥkĵl''; fgfĝ
PARTICULAR FEATURES
Screws eliminated, also cost of holder maintenance.
No tools required.
Springs carry no current, making holder particularly suitable
for gas-filled lamps.
Flex will break before cord grip will give.
Larger area of conductor gripped than by screw point contacts.
Binding of cap, when in position on the heads of the terminals,
prevents heads being raised when a lamp is inserted or
taken out.
It is impossible to replace interior without bringing terminals
into proper position.
Wired quicker than any lampholder on the market, the saving
in time being well over 50 per cent.

At Sydney Cri. Emelie Polini continues
to rip the passions and emotions depicted in
"The Flaw” with capable and powerful
hands. It’s full-flavored melodrama with all
the “body” of a bottle of old port.
Another couple of nights and the sadness
of farewell will be discernible at Sydney
Royal, when the curtain descends on Louis
Bennison in “The Great Lover.” As a gal-
lant and thoroughly impressive wooer, Louis
will leave many pleasant memories behind
him, and a v.h.c. is herewith awarded him
in the special realm of romance where he has
been disporting himself.
Though the cessation of the golden egg-
laying industry has filled Sydney Hippo-
drome with gloom, there is a note of com-
fort in the announcement that AVirths’
Circus pitches its camp on the Haymarket
stand next Saturday night. And, whereas
the just-finished panto contained a solitary
walking Mt. Morgan encased in feathers,
AVirths’ collection in fauna resembles a
miniature Taronga Park. On the two-legged
side there is a combination of equestrians,
tumblers, acrobats, wire-walkers, clowns and
pretty trapezists. In addition, the Cavills
will indulge in watery gambols with local
mermaids and sea nymphs from Bondi; and
that’s seasonable enough for anything.
Sydney Tivoli has a number of new names
in the current programme. The Three Scamps
embark upon a spree of coon-songs and jazz
turns; Sadie Macdonald, who mixes acro-
Datics and catgut, sets one guessing whether
she was originally a violinist or is another
of the long line of tumblers who have de-
veloped a Soul; Chalk-talker Paddy
Saunders is an engaging young Celt whose
drawings are better than his patter; and
the cycling Brunettes pass muster. Bert
Aladdison is headlined in the absence of G.
I'. Huntley, who was to have given Sydney
more of his whimsical subtlety in “A Change
of Tactics,” but went down to the heat. The
Fashion Review looks as though it had come
to stay. It was a great success last Satur-
day, when three pretty Sydney girls trailed
the latest from Paris, supplied by Louise.
The stage was hung with heavy black-vel-
vet curtains, and was furnished with a dress-
ing-table that might have been the fancy of
an artist in La Vie Parisienne. Mostly
Empire, with a dash of Louis Quinze in
its design, it carried enormous candAesi
nearly six feet high. Two frocks that caused
a gasp of delight were the joie de vivre in
hyacinth blue and salmon pink, the bodice
with myriads of stamped figures of pretty
ladies; and a cascade of gold beads that
fell over a foundation of sunset satin.
NICOLA AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Nicola and assistant relieve the egg famine.
As pictures go “Disraeli,” on view at
Sydney Lyceum, would compare favorably
with its contemporaries if the central figure
were fictitious ; but as the hero purports to
be one Benno Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield
and one time P.M. of England, the contro-
versy as to the accuracy of the film grows
fierier every day. “Pardon My French.”
which is holding the house with Benno until
the Methodist Conference starts next week,
produces no comment from historical
pedants. After viewing Gloria Swanson, at
the Strand, in divers stunning gowns, one
wonders whether she is mannequin or screen
actress. The story incidental to the frock-
ing of the female lead is not much
of a joke. Bitter rivalry for the Box-office
Stakes exists between the Empress and
Crystal Palace. Rodolph Valentino in
“Blood and Sand” gives the former a
living start and carries the flappers’ money.
The latter is pulling up with D. W. Grif-
fith’s “Dream Street” and a really funny
parody on Rodolph aforesaid. Globe
patrons bring in a unanimous verdict of
“Manslaughter” against the Sassiety oelle
who runs down traffic cops as a hobby. “The
Sheik’s Wife” has moved to the Majestic,
with hubby and a string of hat-hangers
trailing behind. “The Kentucky Derby/’
filmed at Hoyt’s, is a remarkable instance
of managerial faith in the public’s absent-
mindedness. If the film were a local one
there would be an pension awaiting
every situation and character. The little
Shell has an enigma in “The AVoman AA’ho
Fooled Herself.”
Dorothv Murdoch’s concert at Melbourne
Town Hall last Saturday included J. D,
Brownlee, the young baritone who is going
to Europe in quest of a Future, and will
probably find it. In a programme lull of
gloomy and depressing thoughts Brownlee,
with his melodious heavy bar,tone that tends
to basso, and his Peter-Dawson method
of rapping out his utterances, gave the con-
cert a tone of distinction which it had seem-
ingly tried to acquire by means of unfamiliar
items. Miss Murdoch drew on composers
Bemberg, Hue, Hugo Wolf amp Lully for
sobs and sadness. Her treatment of “The
Three Fishers” (for an encore) was ultra-
theatrical, and her air from “Samson and
Delilah” lacked “punch.” She sings
smoothly, does Dorothy Murdoch, though
her pianissimo has a very limited carrying
power, and the voice is good enough quality.
But there is only a moderate volume of tone,
and little magnetism in the singer’s engaging
personality ; so, all things considered, it is not
wonderful that Europe, whither she jour-
neyed from Melbourne, allowed her to escape.
Brownlee is not likely to get away so easily.
Alberto Zelman made an unfortunate selection
of a cranky composition by Corelli (not
Marie) for his first violin solo, nor was
he nearlv up to his best form in Kreisler’s
“Caprice ATennois.” For the rest, there was
William Burrell as an excellent accompanist,
and Miss Biddy Allen to play a couple of
trifling solo Spanish Dances by Granados.
If the rate at which Biddy played them was
a fair indication of how dances are built in
Spain, no wonder the ladies fly to bull-fights
for distraction. But presumably the timid
little lady did the composer a cruel injustice.
In her present stage of studentship it would
not be safe for her to face an unsympathetic
audience.

AVhile “The O’Brien Girl” is going on for
ever or thereabouts at Melbourne Princess’s,
the theatre round the corner, the Palace, has
parted with its Fullers’ panto, and is now
being disembowelled and made new once
more. AVhen the reconstruction is complete
the Palace will be quite different to the
house where Ada Reeve came to pass a
year ago. “Bulldog Drummond” will find
a home there, it is said.
“Chu Chin Chow,” which Melbourne re-
members as a much more vivacious spectacle
than “Cairo,” is to get an Oscar Asche pro-
duction at Melbourne Majesty’s on Satur-
day. The limelight treatment of “Julius
Caesar” has not been a tremendous attrac-
tion, so at this moment the theatre is closed
for rehearsals of the beauteous show that
Asche ran in London for five solid years.
At Melbourne Royal the warbling of
Gladys Moncrieff and Ilowett AVorster, not
to mention Chisholm and Claude Flemming,
is still helping the general outfit of the opera
to give “A Southern Maid” what the press
calls a well-deserved popularity. At the
same time the 3rd Act continues to make the
rest of the story look rather foolish, the ulti-
mate discomfiture of the Vendetta jokers
being out of all harmony with their previous
murderous professions. For that matter, a
number of things in the story suffer from
the librettist’s inability to reconcile comic-
opera intentions with grand-opera effects;
and although an unexpected snap-shotting
of the Vendetta’s declaration of war is the
brightest bit of humor in the show, much
might be said in favor of cutting the incon-
gruity clean out.
At Melbourne King’s the pirate of
Ambrose Applejohn’s dreams continues to
face Death as though it were no worse than
the camera. Last week’s reference to the
supposititious desperado spoke of him im-
planting several inches of cold steel in the
middle of the first mate, but on second
thoughts this must be corrected to the em-
bonpoint of the Chinese bo’s’n, who dies of
the misadventure. Reflection is ever kind
to the comedy at the King’s. It has a way
of turning up in one’s thoughts, and making
the Adventure of Applejohn a comfort to
one’s troubled mind. Applejohn is a sus-
taining remembrance. The very name has
a bite in it.
Melbourne Playhouse, where highbrow
productions used to come from, is now open

“Omar Ivhayyam” is at Hoyt’s, Melbourne,
this week, and many who go to prey on the
picture go home to scoff the tastier
verses. The grateful philosophy of old
Omar is naturally swamped in bogus Oriental
details. Gloria Swanson flutters about in
“Her Gilded Cage,” looking a little costlier
than other sirens who have tried the same
captivity. Also Hoyt’s have Marie Prevost,
whimsical and diverting, in a new tale, “The
Married Flapper.” The Majestic is unrolling
the Arabian romance, “The Sheik’s Wife,”
which is supposed to have been photoed
on the Bedouin’s native sand, hundreds of
miles from an iced drink. “Determination,”
which follows, adds a trifle to the picture-
gazer’s already robust knowledge of high life
and wickedness in London and Paris. “Love
Never Dies” is the fond delusion that keens
the couples snuggling in the darkest corners
of the Britannia; and “Shirley of the Cir-
cus,” who has been sentenced to a week at
the Melba, is keeping a lot of people off the
streets.

The weather in Adelaide has been playing
into the hands of Dampier and Huxham,
whose rival open-air shows enliven North

“Thersites”: The Amurricans have in-
vented the word “optience” to designate a
movie crowd. An “audience” hears; hence
“opt-ience,” a gathering which sees.
“Patience” seems a more apposite term, for
my dictionary says it means “the quality
of sustaining pain without repining.”
“G.”: W. J. Turner, an Australian, has
published a queer play, “The Man Who Ate
the Popomack.” It was selected by the
British Drama League as an example of
the higher type of the modern literary play.
It may have merits; but I confess I can’t
tell what the author is driving at. The
popomack is a fabulous fruit. It is much
sought after whenever it makes a rare ap-
pearance, though whoever eats it becomes, so
evil-smelling that nobody can approach him.
The hero, who has eaten the fruit, finds him-
self cut off from his fellows, but cannot
understand why his fiancde hasn’t the cour-
age to marry him. Another victim rather
likes the experience, and goes about proudly
in a diving suit. The characters and situa-
tions have no interest; and the symbolism,
if there is any symbolism, has no significance
for me. Has it for anybody?

“Peter” : Ada Ferrar. who first appeared
here in “The Sign of the Cross” and subse-
quently played in “A Royal Divorce’ and
“Under*the Red Robe” with Julius Knight,
was warmly received in London a couple
of months back as Mrs. Gilfillan in a revival
of “Sweet Lavender.” Ada was regarded
as a particular example of “smartness, as
understood in the ’eighties. Her bustle
alone was hailed as a triumph.
“Cyrano”: A recent Bulletin contribu-
tor (I forget his brand and date) held forth
on the need for educating people up to the
enjoyment of good plays. I second the
motion on behalf of oppressed playgoers in
M.L. It too often happens that one’s enjoy-
ment of a good English comedy or drama
is spoilt by the sheet inability of some of
the audience to realise that the piece is not
“crook” stuff, farce or musical cohiedy. The
vacant laugh intrudes in the wrong place,
and there are interruptions that merit
assassination. The unspeakable person who
makes an imitative noise when the hero
kisses the heroine may drift along to a per-
formance of Pinero, Barrie or Galsworthy.
Ethel Irving, the finest artist England has
sent us for many years, was subjected to
such treatment. I have writhed at laughter
in the wrong places at “The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray,” and longed to slay someone at
“Hindle Wakes.” The movies are respon-
sible for a great deal of this lowering of
taste. AVhat else can you expect from vu'gar
melodrama that lacks the spoken word?
How can a fine taste be cultivated when the
beauty and subtlety of language are ban-
ished? We don’t get the best of contem-
irorary drama in the commercial theatres
of Australasia, but if we did 50 per cent, of
the audiences wouldn’t know how to take it.
“0.K.” on the spokeshaving of Shaw: —
Doubtless one of the flies in the ointment of G. B.
Shaw’s triumph over his detractors has been the con-
version of his rarely-acted “Arms and the Man” into
the highly-successful “Chocolate Soldier.” Consider
his 1898 preface to “Plays Pleasant,” which set of
four included “Arms and the Man”: —
Critics... .accuse me.... of paradox, cynicism
and eccentricity, reducible, as some contend, to a
trite formula of treating bad as good and good as
bad. important as trivial and trivial as important,
serious as laughable and laughable as serious, and
so forth. As to this formula I can only say that if
any gentleman is simple enough to think that even
a good comic opera can be produced by it, I invite
him to try his hand, and see whether anything re-
motely resembling one of my plays will reward him.
“The Chocolate Soldier” may, or may not, have
been suggested by Shaw’s reckless challenge. Any-
how, it in a way put him to confusion. No
other opera derived from a dramatic story has
included so much of the form, dialogue and spirit of
the original, or has been more successful in enter-
taining the public. The opera loses nothing of the
satire on human nature, and the shocking absurdities
of militarism, that gave weight to the play, while
the alterations, omissions and amplifications are
improvements on the original. The Bumerli of the
libretto has not been well played in Australia by
Leslie Gaze in the first case, or Workman in later
years, in so far that neither sufficiently suggested the
matter-of-course efficiency of the Swiss professional
soldier. But the heroine’s unwilling susceptibility
to his bluntly courteous masterfulness is more ex-
plicitly shown in the opera than in Shaw’s play.
Nadina’s writing of the letter, and her protest to her
father —“I love him because I hate him, and I hate
him because I love him” —are more descriptive than
any statement, hint or innuendo in Shaw’s dialogue.
And they are the librettist’s own. Indeed, the last
scene in the opera is quite as truthful as, and far
more humorous than, the sudden ending of “Arms and
the Man.”

I see you on your high trapeze,
To craven fear a stranger;
Revolving with amazing ease,
And utter scorn of danger.
You give the audience painful throes
By catching deftly with your toes
When falling headlong from your place,
And wonderfully save your face.
With every turn around the bar
You give an exhibition
Of how supremely fit you are
In physical condition.
Your muscles ripple ’neath your skin,
Your biceps tell us you would win
In any contest, and but few
Mere men would dare compete with you.
You’re palpably attractive, too,
But rarely sons of Adam
With any favor look on you—
In truth they fear you, madam.
For, watching you upon the bar,
They needs must see that what you are
With care and assiduity
Their little wives at home might be!

“Tod”: The folk who guaranteed Ver-
brugghen’s band against losses on the Mel-
bourne visits that are not eventuating are
to be invited to support the increasing de-
mand that Melbourne shall have its own
orchestra. Their money, added to the Lady
Northcote accumulation, would make up a
quite respectable nucleus of £7OOO. There
is some proviso about the older fund that
only its interest shall be employed in assur-
ing good music in Lawson’s State, but this
could be lifted if the contributories are as
much in earnest about music as they say
they are. Now that everybody wants an
orchestra, why not have it?
“R.U.E.”: “Park Royal” (B. 15/2/’23)
hopes against hope. Irene Vanbrugh could
only include “Sweet Lavender” in her reper-
toire by removing herself from the bill, and
that isn’t likely. There is no semblance of
a ijart in “Lavender” for an actress of her
calibre—Dick is the star. Much as I
should like to see a revival—especially after
the successful one in London—l don’t think
there is an earthly prospect of it. Not with
the coming outfit, anyhow.
“Machete”: It was my luck to see the
private screening of the Yankee fillum which
purports to depict the career of Disraeli.

best of Yankee film producers—so sound and

“Santander”: Melbourne’s sad want of
Biblical knowledge is illustrated in “Ambrose
Applejohn’s Adventure” at Melbourne King’s.
When the bogus Russian goddess fails to
vamp the artless Applejohn, there is an ex-
pressive pause to allow the siren to sardoni-
cally remark in her broken Cockney: “Goo’
night, M’sieu’ Josef.” Even when Apple-
john tries to drive in the point by asking him-
self: “Now, I wonder what she means by
Joseph?” the audience sits in stony silence.
On the three occasions I have looked in to
note the effect of the line, there has never
been a titter. But if Applejohn had replied
to the lady’s “Goo’ night” with “Good night,
Mrs. Potiphar,” there would certainly be at
least a giggle among the Methodists present.
“O.Iv.”: In the magazine section of that
New York Times which contained an article
by M. P. Adams on “Savages and Seacows”
I found some comments on all the Hamlets
who have appeared in New York since ever
so long ago. Midway in his discourse the
writer said: —
When we youngsters were taken to see Booth’s
Hamlet we were told that we were witnessing
the perfection of acting. Later, when we saw him
on our own account and compared him with Fechter,
in his yellow wig, down at the Fourteenth-street
Theatre, Irving at his own theatre in London,
Mounet-Sully at the Comedie in Paris, Herr Barnay,
Forbes-llobertson, Beerbohm Tree, Sothern, etc., the
old dictum came back with renewed force. Booth
was as graceful as a Tschaikowsky andante or a
George William Curtis criticism in the “Easy Chair” ;
as impassioned as Dr. Chapin in his Forty-Fifth-
street pulpit; as thrilling as Gillmore’s band or
Barnum’s first three-ring circus.
I don’t see how one professing to have
seen Edwin Booth when he (the critic)
was a child, and again when he was a man,
c-ould intelligently compare him with Fechter,
who played his first iiamlet in London 62
years ago; but let that pass. The only time
I saw Edwin Booth he was in the forties,
and was appearing as Petruehio in the old
one-act version of “Taming of the Shrew.”
He carried a modern riding-whip, swaggered
like a cowboy in a circus, and was, in short,
much the same Yankee Petruehio that Kolker
represented when he played Shakspeare’s
comedy with Margaret Ynglin in Australia.
Only to Americans, of all English-speaking
people, could Booth’s Hamlet have given com-
plete satisfaction. Edwin’s accent and elo-
cution were certainly not the accent and elo-
cution of, say, Gladstone, or Forbes-Robert-
son. But seemingly the modern American
idea is that the old dramatist who wrote
“Hamlet” has settled down in spirit in Noo
Yark.
“G. Rich”: The Fun and Frolic Co.
in our Westralian bush settlement made its
ddbut in a fruit-packing shed. The stage
was composed of jarrah fruit-cases—7oo of
them. Beatrice Day {Mrs. Beatrice Wall),
who deserted the footlights to grow apples,
lives in the district.
“Frinigga” : An old South Australian, now
one of the leading actors in the U.S.A., gets
some carefully-qualified praise in New York
Life
Mr. O. P. Heggie is rapidly qualifying (if Mr.
Ileggie can be said to do anything rapidly) for the
title of The Terrible Meek. Sometimes he is so
terrible meek that it doesn’t seem as if you could
stand it a minute longer....He certainly has got
that pet-horse look down cold. And a rather stupid
pet-horse at that. One that might be called
“Daisy.”
“Stargazer”: Melba, who did not care for
Gertrude Johnson when the latter was a
Con. student under the diva, has apparently
been won over by the Melbourne girl’s per-
formance in Mozart’s “Magic Flute” in Lon-
She went especially to hear Gertrude’s
singing of the “Queen of the Night” arias,
and applauded enthusiastically. She then
approached Gertrude, inviting her to sing
Musetta with __ her in the special perform-
ance of “Boheme,” but this was found to
be impossible. Melba is now giving Ger-
trude Johnson every encouragement, primed
no doubt by the great success of the younger
woman in the broadcast performance of the
“Flute,” in which her singing was praised by
critics all over Europe.
“Dido”: The alterations to Melb. Prin-
cess’s serve to restore the dress-circle to its
former dignity. The circle seats are brought
so far forward that, in the foremost rows,
one has the impression of being in a small
theatre where you are in more intimate
touch with the performers than you were
even in the Bijou of the Brough and Bouci-
cault days. The circle is so withdrawn
from the stage in other theatres that patrons
wishing to be able to exchange “nods and
becks and wreathed smiles” with the girls
in the front ranks of the ballet were driven
into the stalls, which became, of quite re-
cent years, the most fashionable part of the
house, and to get there you were often
penalised a bob or two. The renovated
Princess’s dress-circle should become popu-
lar with the Very Best People again, if only
for the charming view of the really delight-
ful interior it affords.
“D.”: One of Smith’s misprints
(24/2/’23) was unconsciously apposite.
Under a sketch of a performer’s labored
indecencies, the paper mentioned that he
was of “Riskards’ Tivoli Theatres.”
“Lex”: “The Flaw,” at Sydney Cri.,
impressed me as fair melodrama but bad
law. The hero, who is presented as a danger-
ous lunatic, runs true to form and com-
mits a murder. He does it in a trance—a
method new to criminology, but none the less
dangerous for that. The doctor who demon-
strates to the detective how the regrettable
event happened wins from the latter the
opinion that “no jury would convict,” and
the final curtain discloses the homicidal
maniac, apparently normal, standing by his
wife and intoning: “See the sun is rising
for us,” etc., etc. Actually on the evidence
a jury would have to convict or forswear
themselves. Their probable course would
be to bring in a verdict of "guilty while of
unsound mind,” as they mostly do in cases
where a girl murders her secretly-born child
while suffering from puerperal fever. Here
the onus of freeing her is put on the Crown,
and of course—puerperal fever being essenti-
ally transient —she is nearly always freed.
But what Government would be justified in
letting loose on the world such a hopeless
degenerate as Frank Harvey presents in
“The Flaw”?
“Arizona”: Lawrence Grossmith, now
playing in “Ambrose Applejohn’s Adven-
ture” at Melbourne King’s, has an inter-
esting family tree. The founder of the
family, George Grossmith, who was a brother
of the better-known William Robert Gros-
smith, the juvenile actor called “The Young
Roscius,” had some connection with the
stage, but did best as a roundsman for the
London morning press, supplying each paper
with Bow-street reports for a small con-
sideration, which, in the aggregate, furnished
him wifeh a living wage. The old reporter’s
son, another 1 George, father of Lawrence and
the present George, was also on the Inky
Way for a time.' Grandson George, now
manager of two or three theatres in London,
married Adelaide Astor, sister of the ladies
who were known to the stage as Letty Lind,
Millie Hylton, Lydia Flopp and Fanny
Dango. This brilliant quintet came from
Birmingham, and their real name was
Rudge. Lawrence Grossmith married Cora-
lie Blyth, sister of the ill-fated Vernon
Castle. There remains Weedon Grossmith,
Lawrence’s uncle, who died in 1919, seven
years after his brother George, and only 10
after the aforesaid “Roscius,” who reached
the good age of 81. Weedon had some feel-
ing for literature, and no doubt he discovered
a kindred spirit in his wife, May Palfrey, a
doctor’s daughter and a direct descendant of
Charles Lever.

bourne Royal.
A. Howett-
Worster looks

“Orb”: The in-
grained habit of ser-
monising in American
plays is something the
Yanks can’t help.
Uncle Tom started it.
That pious old hum-
bug says: “No, Massa
Legree; ma body may
b’long to yew, but ma
soul b’longs to Wan
above!” (Loud ap-
plause.) And every
U.S. dramatist has
harped on that string
every since—that and
“dear ole mawther.”
It’s a cast-iron con-
vention. But I un-
derstand that the
drama under the ***-
spangled banner is
waking up. A friend
just back from in-
specting the "tank
towns” and “jerk-
water burgs” of the
theatrical circuits tells
me so. (By the way,
a “jerkwater” town is
on a lower plane than
a “tank” village. At
the latter the train
does stop for water,
but at tiie former it
scoops it up on the
run.) He saw one
thriller in Nebraska
(I think), where the
heroine, a lady of
limp m orals, de-
nounced the villain at
the end of Act 3 in
two simple words.
She said: “Y o u
blank!” Curtain and tremendous enthusi-
asm.
“Lucius”: Touching “The Foreigner's
Stranglehold” (B. 8/2/’23), C. It. Herschell,
of Victoria, is going to London to see if there
is really a foreign market for industrial and
scenic Australian films. Among the sets in
his travelling-trunk is a 3000 ft. picture of
the Great Ocean Road. People who have
placed Australian films abroad complain that
their best work has been spoilt by cuts. One
of them took 4000 ft. of the Melbourne water-
works, but by the time it reached the Eng-
lish screen it had been hacked down to 150
feet. Still, one water-supply is very like
another, and what Australian movie crowd
would stand 4000 ft. of the London water-
works? Part of the trouble with the Aus-
tralian film industry is that some of the
people concerned in it are deficient in intel-
ligence. Marie Tempest’s pregnant comment
on American pitchers—“the wrong people
have got hold of them” —is by no means in-
applicable to Australia.
“E.A.”: I can gratify “ChK.’s” curiosity
about ’cellist Gerardy’s age (B. l/2/’23)
by revealing a ghastly secret of my own. I
heard him play 31 years ago when I was a
schoolgirl of 16—he wore brown velvet, and
was a pretty kid of 12. Even at that age
he carefully cultivated the rebellious lock of
hair that so enraptured the flappeis ot the
Boer War period.

subtleties of Gilbertian irony seem to be right
off his beat.
“P.T.” : While waiting for his cue during
a Dunedin (M.L.) performance of “King
John,” Allan Wilkie spied a timid, moth-
eaten super—one of the six who comprise
the armies, six on each side—hanging round.
“Hey,” said Wilkie, “you ought to be on!

were equal to the emergency. Pushing their
way through the crowd of caneworkers wait-
ing morosely outside the local hall, they
rigged their bit of scenery and played for
three hours to a packed house. They moved
on by the 6 a.m. train to the next pitch.
“Ali Selim”: I also saw Mulcaster in
“The Land of Promise” (B. 22/2/’23), and
on his first night at that. The young man
was painfully nervous; his hands shook
uncontrollably as he sat opposite Irene Van-
brugh in the second scene. But he made
good, and had a rousing reception at the end.
His earnestness and capacity were obvious,
and his personal appearance scored a hit
among the skirts and blouses. True, the
play wasn’t of much account. The Times
slated it savagely, and implored the manage-
ment to “spare us the nauseating spectacle
of a hairy savage prating of the Garden of
Eden to the woman he has ravished.” But
it was war-time, and the stuff went down.
“D.8.E.”: “Blackfriars,” in his list of
operas which have not been performed in
Australia (B. 8/2/’23), mentions “The
Secret of Suzanne,” by Wolf-Ferrari. But
wasn’t this operetta put on during Genre’s
tour of Australia 10 years ago? If it wasn’t
I have a ground of action .against my
memory.
“V.V.”: The drought hadn’t broken at
Croajingaloo when the Shottery Shakspeare
Co. arrived, weary and dusty. After fixing up at
the pub, the leading lady requested a bath.
Said Elaine, the housemaid: “We haven’t
got much water, but I’ll ask the missus.”
After a long delay Elaine returned with a
jugful of fluid, to the quantity and quality
of which Desdemona objected. “Why, what’s
bitin’ yer?” asked the indignant Elaine.
“On’y the baby’s been bathed in it.”
“C. Ockney”: Pinero has regained all his
old popularity in London. The jerry-built
pieces of the younger school have gone out
of favor,_ but the well-constructed Pinero
plays of 30-odd years ago are being revived
in turn, with considerable profit to all con-
cerned. “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,”
with Gladys Cooper in Mrs. Patrick Camp-
bell’s original role, ran for 222 perform-
ances at the Avenue recently—a quite
remarkable record for a revival. Now
“Sweet Lavender,” which was first seen at
Terry’s Theatre in ’BB. is being done at the
Ambassador’s, and looks like staying there
for months. By author’s orders the script
has not been altered. All the old asides and
soliloquies have been retained, and the cos-
tumes of the period are worn.

IF YOU want to look your best, you
must be properly corseted—for no
woman ever looked well, or felt well
or appeared to the best advantage, if she
was wearing the wrong corset.
Is the corset you have on perfectly com-
fortable ? Does it exactly fit your figure ?
Or does it “ride up” on your body and
bulge the flesh at the waist, or push up
under the arms, or dig into your legs or do any of those distracting
things that make you uncomfortable and tire you out and give you
that “corseted look” that adds years to your apparent age?
When you buy a corset you want one that is comfortable,one that
will make most of the natural grace of your figure, one that will
wash well and wear well, one that will protect your health and eter_
nally guard you against the injustice of looking older than you are.
Buy a Gossard Corset
Twenty years ago Mr. Gossard discovered in Paris a new kind of
corset —a corset that laced in front, designed for herself by a
French Countess, the Countess Fould de Grasse. Because this
new principle in corsetry offered a protection to the health as well
as to the appearance, Mr. Gossard introduced it to the feminine
world, and the practical artistry of Gossard designers has devel-
oped it to its present perfection. Your own family physician will
agree with other undisputed medical authorities that the front lac-
ing Gossard is the only corset that will give you ideal support.
This matter of designing for your type is the whole secret.
Gossard artists, after studying thousands of women, classified them
into nine figure groups and created special models to take care of
the particular figure needs of each group. There are Gossard Cor-
sets created with just the support you need 'iXyour age and weight
to give you the proper proportions of the type to which you be-
long. Your Gossards will be differently proportioned and differ-
ently boned from the corsets created for the other figure groups.
Perhaps you have been buying your corset by waist measure alone.
That is a fatal mistake and one of the most common causes of cor-
set discomforts. If you want an exactly-right
corset, one that will always be comfortable,
one that will never need “breaking in,” all
you need do is to select a Gossard designed
for you. It is sure to fit you perfectly and
be absolutely comfortable every minute you
have it on.
Go to the Best Store You Know
Do you realise for how little you can buy
these comfortable, graceful, sensible, beautiful Gossard Corsets?
You can get one for as little cost as the ordinary corset. But no
matter what you pay, the Gossard corsetiere who fits you will
know types as well as corsets and will guarantee your satisfaction.
Gossard, Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres like Gossard Corsets are designed for the needs
of the nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne models are priceless
to the woman who heretofore has been unable to find brassieres with
special shaping ' support and flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up over the lower tops of
the modern corsets. Yet they are most reasonably priced within
the reach of every purse.

If you have the slightest doubt about your type of figure, write to
Miss Eleanor Gray, the Gossard Corset Specialist, whose years of
experience are at your service. Use the coupon below, and be sure
it is carefully filled in. Your corset problems will be treated entirely
confidential by Miss Gray and your questions answered personally.

and find any unfailing method of becoming dress. A copy is yours

Modern Man: If the toll system in some
form (it may take the shape of a wheel tax) is
not a fair thing, then the Reds are right in saying
that people who use the railways shouldn’t be
charged for doing it. .. . 8.A.F.: Too small a subject.
W.M. (Mackay) : Thanks: we’ve put that aspect
100 times and are not finished yet Straggler:
Better stick to post and rails.... Whitburn: Topical
verse ought to be more tuneful than that... .Baden
de R.: Pretty empty... .R.A.D.: Very rugged and
doesn’t get to anything Bert B.: “Ben” is rather
a dreary person. .. .Florence H.: Yarn no use, as
far as it is possible to read it.... Basalt Boulder:
You can’t tell a story by merely throwing words
and fragments of words into ink. Study the game
before you play it... .0.W.W.: Nothing much, in
bad verse. .. .W.S.T.: The manner is hot bad, but
the thought is too thin. .. .F.T.B. : ' Doesn’t howl
for print.... Faceplate: A victim of pernicious
anaamia A.8.M.: The sonnet hasn’t enough
interest. .. .C.L. (Bendigo): Rather extravagant....
A.E.M.: Don’t care for the verse. .. .J.E.M.: Wild
bit of melodrama. .. .Sandys: Well enough done,
but don’t care for it. .. . E.P.T.: An overworked
idea that couldn’t raise a smile. . . .T.R'.L.: Suitable
for the Get-Rich-Quick Advocate or some paper
like that.... W.M.H.: “The Kookabarra” has points,
and if you could give him some more he might get
in. .. . W.A.G.: Most of it is pretty mad....Jas. H.:
Only if you are less than 12 will you be forgiven.
. ...J.J.8.: Foundered. .. .Bellerive: We can feel
the breathless rush of it:—
From the traffic of the city
A scorcher fiend sped.
Houses glided by him as
He wildly dashed ahead,
A policeman on a cycle ,
Pursued him from the town.
Trailed the speeding fiend,
But failed to run him down.
Onward he did travel—
Towards the breezy bay.
When he tried to dodge a motor,
And struck a timber dray.
He’s cycle was shattered
By the contact of the crash,
And injured lay the scorcher
’Midst the debris of the smash.
.’.. .A.G.M.: No use adopting that tone. You’re
not addressing a Sunday-school class... .K.R.M.H.:
Same old commonplaces. Even the color is borrowed
from another land.... 0.C.0.: Has that tired feel-
ing.... Ajax: Spoiled in the telling. A yarn is
one thing and a sermon is another. .. .Helen S. (or
some other letter): That alphabet business is one
of the most irritating things we know.... Lone
Hand: You don’t make a yarn out of your material.
....F. (Balmain): Poor verse... .Stanley S.:
Worse... .C.W.G.: Doesn’t get near... .Donald G.:
Pleasing enough, but not much market here for
those wares. .. .K.1.D.: Doesn’t make a story....
E.R.D.: No, thank you. . . .Tex F.: Too rugged. .. .
P.O’R.: Thin and rather commonplace. .. .Fred A.:
The yarn isn’t much and the setting and method
aren’t very original. .. .P.A.R.: Far too loose and
lumpy. ... Harold S.: Doesn’t appeal to u 5....
FLA. (Hornsby) : Send it to the lady. She might
put it in her album—if she is not a,very particular
lady... . E.S.N,: F’alls all over the place.... Macgee:

Last night in a dream I ascended to Heaven’s high
gate
Where Myriads of Seraphs waited for me.
I was then presented with a magic Harp of gold,
And a Cherub led me, away, across a mysterious
sea,
Over purple Hills, through verdant valleys cool,
To a happy and contented land,
Where I did not have to barter my soul.
To enter With my harp in hand
My fingers lightly on the Lyre did rest.
It sobbed with mercy as I drew it to my breast.
When 1 played on tlie cords with all my might,
F’or Humanity there gushed a hopeful light,
And the masses with faith anew looked up above.

happened at Helidon (Q.), where the spa
water comes from. Both the R.C. and Angli-
can churches were in need of new buildings,
but instead of each seeking subscriptions on
the strength of being the only reliable sky
pilots, the primitive people have decided to
make a common appeal on behalf of both
demoninations, and to share the proceeds 50-50.

“Park”: The crews of German boats
arriving recently have been cursing the
jugglers of the mark. The men’s screw for
a. month’s toil totals about 10s. in Austra-
lian money, and it takes about two days’
wages to buy a drop of lager ashore.
* * * *
"Azrim”: “Girofla’s” pharmacological
notes on Strychnos psilosperma (B. S/2/’23)
suggest that we might easily hop in and
grow our own strychnine. Botanists avef
that the herb (Strychnos nux-vomica) Heeds
a moist, hot climate, such as that of the
West Indies, where it is indigenous, but
certain parts of Bananaland—lnnisfail, for
example—should answer the purpose equally
well. As for the demand, liquor strych. and
tinct. nucis vom. figure in many prescrip-
tions, certain salts are used for hypodermic
injection and the strychnine sulphate used to
spiflicate Brer Babbit must cost thousands.
And at present we import every grain of it.
“Bullswool”: The bowl was of polished
hardwood and the man was busy washing
socks. I admired his basin and he explained.
“You know those big gums that look in the
family way; well, I cut off the lump, clean
it out, sandpaper it and it saves buying a
dish. They don’t warp; I’ve used this ohe
nearly a year.” The same craftsman dl§b
showed me a bench which he had veneered
with the wood from the inside of the bowl.
The grain and polish were glorious. I
advised him to try selling them, but he was
sceptical. “Oh, anyone could make them
by the dozen.” It was no use telling him
that no one did.
* * * *
“Dash Dotty”: The wireless valve has
solved the problem that has been bothering
telephone people for a long time. Until the
valve arrived there was no efficient telephone
repeater, wherefore long-distance lines had
to be provided with thick, heavy wire. On
the new Sydney to Melbourne trunk line
two valve repeaters are now installed, one
at Albury and the other at Yass, and wire
only a quarter as thick as the old No. 1
trunk is used. The installation of these
valves does not interfere with the telegraph c
value of the circuit, and in addition to the
telephone connection two Canadian duplexes,
enabling four messages to be transmitted at
the one time, have been arranged.
“F.C.’s” smuggler goes his rounds I
I had a pleasant excursion one iiiorning with A
chance acquaintance; He had a motor-bike and side-
car, and we did a grand tour of various city pubs.
In the bottom of the side-car were a couple of bulky
brown-paper parcels, which he carried into the pri-
vate bars. He seemed to be well known to Hebe,
and, leading her aside, would display his wares and
mostly effect a sale. Later he explained that he
found it paid to sell to the barmaids, as they were
usually pretty “flush” and asked no questions. He
was one of the cleverest cargo-broachers on the
wharves, and his speciality was dress materials. On
the morning I was out with him he was hawking
silk, which he had souvenired from a Jap. boat in port
at the time. About a year later he made the mis-
take of taking to honest work for a spell—or for a
blind fell down the hold of a ship and broke his
neck.
* * * #
“Sierra”: According to the 1922 report
of the N.S.W. Microbiological Laboratory,
shaving-brushes of brands which have been
known to be infected by anthrax are still
to be seen in many Sydney shop windows.
As an easy-going people this cheerful news
may not worry us; but, perhaps the casual
Australian, standing before the mirror on
the morning after the night before, with a
razor m one hand and a culture of lather
teeming with anthrax bacilli in the other,
niight profitably ponder on the following:
“That cases of anthrax are not more com-
mon can only be due to the fact that it is
necessary for the skin to be pierced before
infection can take place. In nearly all cases
there is a history of the patient having
cut himself whilst shaving.” It may steady
the hand.
* * * *
“P.X.”: Some day the nabobs who have
the control of navigation in Sydney Harbor
will have to consider whether they shouldn’t
adopt a regulation which the Port of Lon-
don authority found necessary. In former
days vessels using the Thames and its estu-
ary made any old use of their sirens that
pleased them. They called to the agents
on shore, or chortled to passing friends
or made wild noises on general principles.
Now the siren may be used only for making
a signal known to the navigation laws, with
the result that when a skipper or a’ pilot
hears a whistle he springs to attention, be-
cause he knows he is interested in it. The
practice in Sydney Harbor at present is
much the same as if a railway signalman
used kis lights to flash friendly signals to
passing engine-men and guards—to let them
know, for example, that he was jolly glad
that Hardmouth won the Bobbery Park
Stakes or that Mrs. Guard was doing well
after twins.

“Dr. Nil”: In a sub-leader (8/2/’23) The
Bulletin dealt with the matter of increas-
ing the yield of crops. Mav I say “I told
you so”? When I went to Balaklava (S.A.)
m 1891 as a sawbones, I found that on mixed
land—mallee, red claypan and sandy scrub
—the average crop per acre was from four
to six bushels. Being very young, and look-
ing younger, I ventured to suggest that the
land should be manured. I was told that
the land was worked out. and that when
sheep were depastured on it they did all the
manuring that was possible. 1 said, “But
they take off the land several times as much
as they leave behind,” was scoffed at, and
told to talk about that of which I knew. I
was offered much of that land by insolvent
cockies at 10s. an acre freehold.' Being an
idiot and a coward I didn’t buy it. But
somebody (probably a l’ankee ‘agricultural
machinist) prevailed upon them to take my
advice, and they fallowed and super-phos-
phated; and now, instead of reaping an
average of five bushels of wheat at Is 6d
and 2s. 6d. a bushel, they get about 10
bushels minimum, and sell at an average of
4s. 6d. a bushel. But they don’t call any-
one a fool for advocating fallowing and
manuring now. The fool, of course, is the
chap who told the other chap how to make
money and didn’t make it himself. Which
is me.

“Energy ’: Re “Iford’s” Westralian-born
M’s.H.R. (B. l/2/’23), Elias Solomon was
not a Groper. He was born in London in
September, 1839, came the following year
with his parents to Adelaide, and didn’t
make for the Swan till 29 years later.
“Wild Oat”: “Digger’s Batman” says (B.
8/2/’23) that “when a war-widow re-marries
her pension continues for two years.” In
this lie is partly mistaken. The pension
is reduced (in the case of a ranker’s wife)
from £2 2s. to £1 3s. 6d. per week. How
do I know? I married one.
One hundred and thirty years ago, on
February 18, the first school in Australia
was opened by parson Johnson, chaplain with
the first fleet. The schoolhouse was at the
end of a row of huts known as Bell Row,
near the junction of the present Hunter and
Castlereagh streets, Sydney, on one of the
corners of which a building was sold a few
days ago for £BO,OOO.
“Adelaide”: The Abo. Friends’ Assoc, in
S.A. is trying to get the Government to
establish homes for native children, where
they may be trained in conventional morals.
There are good settlements for abos. at
loint Pearce and Point Macleay; but the
trouble may be most delicately indicated by
figures, which show, at the two places, 530
half-castes and only 70 full-blooded natives.
It is estimated that South Aus. now has
about 3750 true sons-of-the-soil; but the
number decreases, steadily, if slowly, every
year.
‘ Herodot”: Lately there has been a keen
demand in the Commonwealth for oil of
neroli, which is extensively used in the
manufacture of the cheaper brands of
perfumes, and large quantities have been
imported from Europe. Yet there is
any amount of raw material in the wild
lemon-tree, which flourishes round about
Sydney, and its extraction is only a matter
of erecting an ordinary still and condenser.
Samples made from trees growing between
Newcastle and the Ilawkesbury compare
favorably with imported brands, which sell
here at a high figure.
“Lip”: Ingenious are the methods of the
Sydney land-selling firms which advertise
for “Land Salesmen. No experience neces-
sary. Expert training given.” There seems
to be a perennial supply of would-be sales-
men, and it s a daily event in any Suburb
suspected of having buyers to see parties
(technically “teams”) .of men, mostly young
and mostly wearing Digger badges, depioying
under the guidance of ail '‘(expert” to a
house-to-house canvass for the Paradise Park
or Elysium Fields estate. Of course the
terms are “no sale no pay”; and as most of
the team are fed-up and footsore after a
tew hours’ tramping, the firm gets for the
outlay of a few bob in fares an incalculable
amount of word-of-mouth advertisement.
“Harold Hardupp” : It is possible for the
man who needs it to obtain in Svdney a
shave or y haircut, of sorts, for nothing. A
Reni ? s ; Who has decide< i that a school is
much better than a shop has established a
hairdressing college” where embryo barbers
may acquire the rudiments of their profes-
sion for a fee, and the hairy dead-beat who
hasn t the money to pay for the loss of his
whiskers, or prefers to keep it for beer, can be
shorn gratis. The idea is an old one in
London, but it is probably new in Australia.
Even here it is not the first attempt to
exploit the educative side of a very ancient
calling. A few years ago an enterprising
person advertised, that he was prepared to
give instruction in hairdressing by corres-
pondence.
Judge Gordon, of S.A., has made a pro-
test against the old-fashioned statutes—de-
rived originally from the law of Moses—
which make , an offence “against nature’*
only less serious than murder itself, Sen-
tencing a man of 48 who pleaded guilty to
what the papers evasively call “a serious
offence, thus the Judge: “I am sorry to
say that the least I can give is 10 years’
hard labor. It is a savage penalty; our
.riminal Law (Consolidation Act is 47 years
o.d, and needs to be revised. In rape the
lowest term is four years; where a child’s

i The Wanderer” : Talk about “encouraging
local industry and the manufacture of news-
print in Australia”! Why, as long ago as
June 6, 1868, the late Horace Dean, con-
ductor of the Manning River News, published
this par.:—
The News appears to-day on colonial paper, which
although somewhat rougher than the English, will
be found stronger when dry. The parcel now in
our possession is said to be the first of full-size
produced in N. S. Wales —hence we were glad to
encourage colonial enterprise by giving it a trial.
No doubt a smoother and in all respects a better
paper will be produced by the Sydney mills at no
distant period.
THe prediction of 54 years ago is slow in
being fulfilled, though it has long been exer-
cising the mind of the Country Press Asso-
ciation. Incidentally, the Manning River
News itself petered out long years ago. It
used to be published at Tinonee. Now there’s
not even a pub in the old town.
“R.P.”: I offer this, from a 20-year-old
liananaland paper, as the queerest “profes-
sional” advt. ever published in Australia -
PUBLIC NOTICE.
I beg to announce that I resumed practice in
earnest as a Solicitor, this time in Barcaldine, it
being more central for my class of work. My
motto has always been, and is now, first come first
served, except retainers.
I warn all the Gossips and Buzzers of the countrv
to keep clear of me and my family, otherwise I will
see what the Courts can do.
Whilst also thanking my many so-called friends
for supplying me with so many wet wickets, I ask
them to desist for the future. The money they
would freely expend on me in Shouts would be
better spent in a wig and gown.

Luncheon Cheese
No need to get up at daybreak and tire yourself
out cutting mountains of sandwiches. Instead
pop into the hamper a couple of tins of Rex
Luncheon -Cheese, a loaf of bread, and, if you
prefer, a jar of butter, though it’s not necessary
with “Rex” Cheese.
Then in the shade of the trees, or on the sands,
as the case may be, you can make the sandwiches
as they are needed —fresh, tasty and satisfying.
“Rex” Luncheon Cheese possesses all the valuable
food properties of perfectly matured cheese. In
addition it is easily digested by those to whom
ordinary cheese is “Taboo.”
In handy hygienic tins at all grocers. Be sure
you get “ Rex.’’

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel
that you are getting old? Having made up your mind that
you are a martyr, do you vent your ill-humor on the family?
After a while, the pain and stiffness leave you, and you forget
your troubles until the next morning, when the same dull pain
in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing your
nerves, brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim, and
you are starting on a long journey towards ill-health and
infirmity. The kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleans-
ing out the impurities from your blood. Each day there is an
accumulation of waste which must upset the body. It forms
Uric Acid, and Uric Acid is the most insidious form of poison-
ing that can take place in your body. The number of ills
to which it leads is almost limitless, and though middle age is
the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers, and sometimes dies from the different mani-
festations of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable,
specially-prepared remedy, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your sluggish kidneys to
re-action, and assist the work of removing impurities from
your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that
are filtering the blood that the work is done automatically as
by a perfect machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling,
dragging feeling gradually leaves you; in the morning you
can leap from bed, feeling a glow of health and vigor, and
meet life with a smiling face.
It is the duty of every man, not only to himself, but to
the world at large, to keep his health in the proper condition
for his daily task; and for the victim of Kidney Trouble Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost his organs need
to make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to ill-health.

If it’s Texaco Harvester Oil
You’re Safe.
The harvest season is a time for action. You haven’t the opportunity then to
adjust the bearings or replace worn parts on your harvesting machinery.
Every piece of equipment should be in perfect working order. It will be if you
give just a little attention to mechanical details—PLUS REAL LUBRICATION.
And lubrication means more than just swabbing on any grease or oil that happens
to be around the place.
It means careful selection of the right lubricant, and its proper use.
There is a Texaco Farm Lubricant for every purpose.
Use Texaco Harvester Oil for harvesters. It lubricates, and keeps the
bearings clean. It does not gum. Texaco Crater Compound is made for all
exposed gears. It adheres perfectly under all conditions, reduces wear, and protects
the parts from rust when standing idle. Ask for the Texaco product you need.

“Blackbird and Thrush in Every
Bush.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
HARK! ’tis the blackbird with his
golden note,
Rounded and mellow as the melting
fruit,
And jocund as the ever-bubbling bruit
Of summer rivers; how the echoes gloat
Oh the full bounty of his easy throat.
Till many a murmur of their airy lute,
Soft following the magic of his flute,
Garlands each ringing phrase he sets afloat.
I have been seeking words to fit his song,
Sweet, fluid words that yet have kinks and
curls,
Swift as the circling of an eddy’s whirls,
Melodious words, refulgent and profuse,
But all our speech is dull with long misuse,
Corroded deep with blasphemy and wrong.
11.
The blackbird’s note is richer, but the thrush,
Threading his silver song through the pure
calm
Of the rapt morn, a tremulous, sweet psalm
Pellucid as the dews that star the lush
Untrodden grasses, ardent as the gush
Of living water, has the power to charm
The rebel soul till sullen pride disarm,
Sparing those tendernesses it would crush.
He loves his sorrow; singing to the soft
Ethereal splendor of awakening skies,
Musing he grieves most tenderly, and oft
Voices nostalgia in impassioned cries,
Stabbed with remembrance of some northern
croft
That he has seen but through ancestral
eyes.

OT any gaspers, Mr. Lonely?”
II ’ The Doc.’s voice was so almost
inaudibly hoarse that gaspers
seemed the last thing he should want. No
matter; Fred Lonely smiled alertly.
“Gaspers, Digger? Yes; what kind?”
Mrs. Clancy gathered up her parcels from
the counter and turned a large face and two
lazy, friendly eyes to the Doc.
“ ’Ow are yer doin’ with the toilet
requisites, Mr. Cardigan?”
“Oh, not too badly, Mrs. Clancy, thank
you. They don’t go so quickly as the note-
paper and oddments, but there’s more profit
in ’em.” He lit one of the gaspers. “But
I wish I didn’t have to talk so . much.”
Certainly it was only mid-day and you
could hardly hear him now. Years ago, be-
fore 1914 and the introduction of poison-
gas into: warfare, you could hear him well
enough in the students’ common-room at
the hospital or on the tennis-courts or even
in the wards, when need arose. But not
now. The gas had changed all that-had
blown away the strong hope and promise of
the hospital’s star surgical student on its
foetid billows as it had blown away
young Cardigan’s youth. Instead, a dreary,
breathless man in smoked spectacles whis-
pered at back doors and peddled oddments
about the city, rooming in the ’Loo because
it was cheap, and living in the open air as
much as he could, because only thus could he
hope to live anywhere for long.
“Them cig’rettes,” Mrs. Clancy began, and
stopped as a figure came across the road.
The lady bowed primly and wished her good-
morning. A veiled antagonism and scorn
appeared in the lazy eyes.
“Good mornin’, Mrs. Jones.”, Mrs.
Clancy’s voice had an undertone of scorn,
too, of which the stiff, well-dressed and hope-
lessly genteel Mrs. JoneS was woodenly un-
conscious. Over the rim of her hard linen
collar she looked coldly down on Mrs. Clancy
with the air of the parson’s wife being
friendly with the village charwoman.
“I sent some people over to you this
mornin’, Mrs. Jones. I couldn’t take ’em—-
I’m full up for months.”
“Yes. Very kind of you. They came; but
they wanted a furnished room. So they
went away again.”
“ ’Ow are yer doin’ with the unfur-
nisheds?”
“Oh, quite all right, thank you. I don’t
think it’s right to fill the house with sUoddy
time-payment furniture to be knocked to
pieces by the class of people who come here.
Besides, I shouldn’t like to feel that I was
responsible for a house full of that sort of
rubbish. That isn’t what we call furniture,
you know, Mrs. Clancy.” The white face
smiled condescendingly into Mrs. Clancy’s
expressionless eyes. “I must show you my
own room one day, where my heirlooms are,
to give you an idea of what the English
furnished room is like.”
Her frigid, precise bow included Fred and
the Doc. as she turned and went up the
street, her speckless coat and skirt and
glittering shoes, her pork-pie hat and the
angle of her chin all consciously superior to
her surroundings. She was thin and pale,
would have confessed possibly to 35 on oath,
and would have defended her niceness and
gentility to her last superior gasp.
The group on Lonely’s doorstep watched
her out of sight; when she had turned the
corner Mrs. Clancy grunted.
“Wouldn’t it nark yer. Fred? ‘Heirlooms’
—‘the clarss of people’!” Measureless con-
tempt mocked in Mrs. Clancy’s soft voice.
“ ’Ere in the ’Loo—Gawd lumme!” Words
failed Mrs. Clancy.
Fred laughed. “Oh. well, I s’pose it
amuses ’er.” Fred’s youth on tour had
taught him tolerance —obtrusive tolerance,
at times. “But why don’t she get ’er goods
’ere?” he asked, coming nearer the knuckle.
“ ’Cos it’s classier to go to the city with
’er marketin’ barsket on ’er arm.” Mrs.
Clancy gave a rapid impression of a mincing
elephant aristocratically carrying a basket.
The Doc. chuckled soundlessly. “Who is
she?” he whispered.
Mrs. Clancy put her parcels firmly back
on the counter and leaned comfortably
against it.
“She’s the Pommy Bride,” she opened
dramatically, “or that’s what we call ’er.
She got ’er ’ooks into some poor Digger over
there—Gawd spare me days, what some of
’em did marry, to be sure! They ’ad a place
somewhere up-country ’ere, an’ ’e died soon
after they started. Bit o’ luck,” she added
tersely, as Fred went behind his counter for
"Two ’apenny jumbos, please.”
“ ’Er place is opposite mine,” Mrs. Clancv
went on, “an’ it’s that neat an’ clean, as
the sayin’ is, it’d fair give yer the ’orrors.
Why, the winders ’d blind yer,’ she said in-
dignantly, “an’ yer wouldn’t dare walk on
the path or the steps or put yer ’and on the
door-knob. Not that you ever see miladj
cleanin’ or whitenin’ or rubbin’ the brass—
oh, no! She does it all in the middle of the
night, an’ goes sailin’ out in the mornin
castin’ ’er eye over the way the ’Ouse looks
Tryin’ to kid yer she’s got a couple of ser
vants —no need to soil ’er ’ands, oh no.”
The indignation faded out of Mrs. Clancy’s
eyes, but the scorn stayed there.
“An’ what’s the good of it, Mr. Cardigan:
She only gets the riff-raff who put in a bit o'
t.-p. furniture an’ flit, leavin’ ’er to pay the
piper. A dozen times I seen the cart come
an’ take away a load of furniture from ’er
place—l can’t ’elp seein’ it, ’er bein’ opposite.”
Lonely laughed again. “Ups an’ downs,
Mrs. Clancy; ups and downs. She’s only just
started. Give ’er a chance.”
“An’ what chance does she give me, with
’er nose in the air an’ ! er Pommy talk ?
You’d think the ’Loo an’ the ’ole of Austra-
lia wasn’t fit to black ’er boots. An’ ’er an
unfurnished resident’al in Braziei’-street!”
Mrs. Clancy collected her parcels again,
and turned heavily at the door.
“Many’s the time I’ve tried to ’ave a bit
of a chat with ’er an’ show ’er the ropes,
but she sits on me ever . ; ie as ’ard as if
I was tryin’ to nip her for a bob. So she
does everybody. Why, look” —the large,
flushed face loomed in the doorway, “she
won’t even take ’er pension—’asn’t earned
it, she says. Spare me days, didn’t my boy
Con earn it for me?”
Fred made conciliatory, applauding noises
in the face of the rising tide of indignation.
“So did ’er poor bloke earn it for ’er.
Earn it? I sh’d think ’e did. But, no-
milady’s too ’igh-class to take charity, as
she calls it. ‘Clarss of people!’—thang
Gawd there ain’t many of ’er clarss!” Mrs.
Clancy snorted in a final burst of rage, and
disappeared.
The Doc. threw away his gasper, picked
up his suit-cases, and followed her into the
mid-day glare. For a week he fagged up
and down, selling toothpaste and shaving-
soap, getting part of his voice back some-
times and losing it again, but losing nothing
of the spirit which kept him going. Day
after day he whispered and choked at office
doors and kitchen doors, and over the coun-
ters of shops, carrying on under a load that
he knew would never lift Sometimes this
knowledge was quiescent—he could dodge it;
but sometimes it rose before his mind, black
and appalling and as undodgeable as the
fall of night. At these times the Doc.
wavered; but not for long. His keenness
drove the dread depression away in the end,
as the thought of the millions of other people
in the world came to his aid. Soon he was
himself again, calm and even merry, and
as cunning as any pawnbroker to sell you
a toothbrush you didn’t want. Going down
Cathedral-street after an unusually heavy
turnover in the toilet-requisite market he
heard himself hailed from behind.
“Hold on, Doco; I’ve chased you from
William-street. Give a bloke a chance.”
The stranger wiped his brow.
“Could you keep one down, Doc.?”
Cardigan peered at him.
“Oh, Lever!” he said, holding out his hand
after a moment’s scrutiny. “Yes, I could
easily keep one down.”
At a table in Ryan’s parlor the Doc.
looked at Lever again. Three times
wounded (and one a Blighty), Lever was
hale and hearty; a bit haggard, perhaps, and
rather worried looking, but hale and hearty.
“What are you doing in Sydney?” The
Doc.’s voice was better to-day. “I thought
you had a farm or something up country.”
“So I have —a poultry-farm outside Liver-
pool.” Lever seemed pre-occupied. He
picked up his beer once or twice and put it
down untasted. Every now and again he
looked at the Doc. and looked away again
without speaking ; and every now and again
he broke into voluble chatter of days in
France, the Doc.’s gas, the cost of poultry-
feed, and so on. After his third gust of
society prattle the Doc. wheezed into the
following silence.
“What’s wrong. Lever? You’re all nerves.
Been on a scoot?”
“No.” Lever looked at him. He remem-
bered the Doc. in France in tight places
and in dreary,, hopeless places, in Ilorse-
ferry-road—solid ’ sort of cove. He swal-
lowed his beer and leaned over the table.
“I say, Doc., got anything to do for an
hour?”
Cardigan indicated his suit-cases. “Only
the shop,” he said ; “I can’t sell you a tin
of talcum-powder, I s’pose? Make you stink
beautiful. Or some shaving-cream?”
“No, don’t be a goat. Are you specially
busy for an hour?”
“Why?”
“Because —well, will you come with me on
a —on a job I’m doin’ to-day?”
“Work?”
“No, not work.” Lever sighed.
“Is it far?”
“No; couple of streets away.” Lever’s
eyes pleaded. “Come on, Doc. I’m all in
the dark —I dunno what I’ll get or what
she’ll” Lever’s voice trailed into
silence, his eyes still pleading. The Doc.
looked hard at him from behind his grey
windows, at the strained lines in his face,
the nervous twitch of his hands. The star
surgical student stood up, and picked up his
shop
“Righto,” he whispered. “Come on.”
They turned the corner into Brazier-street
and walked in silence down half its length.
Nearing the house whose spick-and-soan-
ness had so infuriated Mrs. Clancy, the Doc.
saw the Pommy Bride coming down the path.
“Here’s a go,” he said: “here’s the ’Loo’s
star performer. Wait till you get a good
look at”
Lever stopped dead as Mrs. Jones came
through her gate and turned to face them.
“My God!” he said under his breath;
and again, “My God!” as she stood rigid
before them, her haggard eyes staring into
his face. The eyes closed and the stiff figure
sagged limply to the pavement as she fainted
at their feet.
Mrs. Clancy was over the road and help-
ing Lever to lift the prone figure almost

burn. Get your box to-day from the
Chemist or Storekeeper, or post free
from the Proprietors. Do it now; be
ready for emergencies.
Have You Tried This
Wonderful Healer?
The unparalleled success of Zam-Buk is due to its
wonderful healing power —the result of years of
careful scientific research for a combination of the
purest herbs endowed with rare healing powers. Thus Zam-
Buk is free from animal fats which cause ordinary oint-
ments to go rancid, and to become useless.
The discovery of this healer made possible the success-
ful home treatment of all those skin disorders that, before
the arrival of Zam-Buk, were liable to become chronic,
owing to the inefficient treatment resorted to. Zam-Buk has
a threefold action. The wonderful healing properties of this
potent balm, its soothing powers and its valuable antiseptic
influence are equally effective.
Zam-Buk is safe; it prevents a sore place from becoming
poisoned, as it actually destroys all harmful disease germs
and draws out all irritation from the tissues. Thus the
growth of new, healthy skin and sound tissue is assured.

I\6 and 3/6 of all Chemists and Stores -
simultaneously with Mrs. Jones’s falling.
Together they carried the featherweight bur-
den up the staring white path and
through the door into the empty, spotless
hall. Here, Mrs. Clancy left the carrying to
Lever, who gathered up the Pommy Bride
as if she were a baby.
“I wonder which’d be ’er room now,” Mrs.
Clancy said. She opened the door of the
front-room, which was as spotless and empty
as the hall. The back-room yawned as
aggressively clean and empty as the others.
Mrs. Clancy paused, looking uncertainly
from the Doc.’s grey glasses to the white,
haunted face of Lever. Suddenly a thought
struck her—the disused scullery. The
men who built the terraces of the ’Loo had
doubtless a large vision of prosperous house-
holds with plenty of maids at work, so each
old house has a scullery as well as a laundry
and pantry. Now the scullery makes a good
bedroom for a landlady who may want to
command a view of both the back and the
front doors and the comings and goings of
her lodgers.
Mrs. Clancy looked round the little room,
at some sacks and threadbare rugs on the
floor, at a tin-bowl and jug beside the stove,
at an apron, a cup, and a pair of working-
gloves on the table. Nothing else-—no other
possessions, heirloom or new, good or bad.
Mrs. Clancy’s astonished eyes softened sud-
denly as she closed the door and turned to
Cardigan and Lever.
‘Bring er over to my place,” she said;
“she won’t know we’ve been”- .
Lever gently lowered the Bride on to
Mrs. Clancy’s mountainous bed. White and
still she lay there while the Doc. pushed
back her eyelids and felt her pulse. For
a moment he stood looking down at her; his
face was puzzled as he leaned closer and
listened. She shuddered and gasped through
a succession of quick, strangling breaths, as
if she were fighting for air. The Doc.
straightened up, his eyes bright and hard
behind the spectacles; his voice was almost
full as he spoke sharply to Lever.
“Run up to Ryan’s and get a flask of
brandy., Go for your life.”
‘lt’s only a faint, isn’t it, Mr. Cardigan?”
Yes, Mrs. Clancy; but it looks like a bad
one. Could you take her bodice oft and
loosen her corset, please? Keep her as
as / ou can - .

Mrs. Clancy. She interposed her broad body
between him and the patient

and uncertain, quite unlike her usual definite
‘oau n ... ~ , , , ~ .
Oh, well, unbutton it; but get the corset
loose as quickly as you can.” He
came over and looked down at Mrs. Jones.
“™ s , ia as much hunger as anything,” he
Sa i?v tv? .j
Yes, Mrs. Clancy said.
Lever came in. Here *ou afe, Doc.”
Cardigan lifted the patient’s head an inch
or two and poured a few dfops of the brandy
into her mouth. She choked for a moment,
but subsided once more into' death-like coma.
“Open that window wider, please, Mrs.
Clancy, and keep on fanning her with the
paper. We can't do anything but wait
now. If she doesn’t come out of this soon
we must get a hypo, and some strych.
You’ve got plenty of blankets handy and
some hot water?”
“Yes,” Mrs. Clancy said again.
Ah anxious silence fell in the jumbled
room, half bedroom and half kitchen. Lever
sat with his head between his hands staring
a t the floor; Mrs. Clancy waved the folded
Herald back and forth; and Cardigan
watched the lifeless figure on the bed. The
afternoon murmur of the ’Loo came dully
in at the window, making a background for
the anxious silence, a background which
hardly broke it.
Presently a sob from Lever broke it. The
Doc. looked up, but Lever continued to
stare at the carpet. His voice, too, was
strained and muffled when he spoke,
“D’yoil think it’s all right, Doc?”
“Yes, I think so. We can only wait.”
The Doc.’s eyes, looking unseen at Lever,
were puzzled. Lever was taking this acci-
dent hard,
“I s’pose she might peg out?”
“She might. You can’t tell in syncope,
But she looks strong enough, for all she
hasn’t had a meal for a week.”
Lever gulped. “What a finish!” he mut-
tered. The Doc. turned round and faced
him, but Lever went straight on with his
monologue of broken sentences in a dreary
dead-level voice, as if there were no audience
to his testimony of folly and broken faith.
“You never know what you’ll do till you
get to it. I hadn’t heard from my wife for
10 years when I went overseas. I knew
she was alive but” he nodded towards
the bed, “and. she was good to me when I
was all-in after a knock. on the head, at
Blighty. Three sisters they were, quiet,
old-fashioned people, an’ I was billeted on
’em to convalesce. I wouldn’t have thought
of it only the other two started ragging me
about Ethel.” He nodded to the bed again,
“I found her cryin’ her eyes out in the
garden the night before I left, an’ then I
thought of it. An’ I meant it. So on me
long leave we got—-married.”
Mrs. Clancy’s shuffling Herald ceased
f or a moment, and the Doc. got up and
put his finger on the Bride’s pulse. He
sat down again without looking at Lever.
“I came home for ine discharge and told
her I’d get things started and send for
her. But I didn’t send for her. After a
bit she cabled she was coming out, and she
came and took hold at Liverpool. It
was all right, but she seemed to make the
li es I’d told her and all that get on me
nerves, and I gave her the truth. I’ll never
forget her face when I told her ”
He looked over at the bed and paused for
a moment
“I didn’t know what I’d got till I lost
it. She took what was left of her own bit
of money and cleared. She said without
any rowin’ that she couldn’t stand the sin
and the dishonesty—that she couldn’t feel
clean. She’d go back home and say noth-
ing to anybody about the—the bigamy.”
Lever dropped his hands on his knees and
looked ud at the Doc.
“Last month me wife died in Perth....
an’ there’s Ethel peggin’ out! Can't yer
do something, Doc?’’
Mrs. Clancy closed her eyes and stopped
her Herald again. “She’s all right, Dig-
ger,” she said softly.
“I cabled to her sister and she, answered
she wasn’t there. I put a private detective
on her and he traced her. After she left
me she fell ill and had to go to hospital.
She was months in bed. When she came out
she could only do a bit o’ sewin’ —too weak
....An’ then that stopped—she wasn't
brought up to work or look after ’erself.
With the last bit of her money she paid
six months’ rent of that house and started
lodgings—unfurnished, because she couldn’t
put down the deposit. Tryin’ to get clean!”
The Bride stirred and Cardigan got up
and peered down at her. “It’s Q.K.,” he
said, turning round to Lever, “she’s com-
ing to.”
Mrs. Clancy pushed the Doc. out of her
way. “ ’Ere, quick,” she said, “let me button
up her bodice over that shift.”
Mrs. Jones sighed and opened her eyes.
Seeing Mrs.. Clancy she started up and
looked round the room; she sighed again
with relief as her head fell back.
“ ’Ow are yer now, Mrs. Jones? You
give us quite a turn goin’ off like that.
Mr. Cardigan’s a friend o’ mine so ’e
brought you in ’ere.”
Mrs. Jones’s eyes were on Lever’s hag-
gard face. “Bill!” she whispered. “Oh, Bill!”
Mrs. Clancy beckoned the Doc., and took
him down to the lodgers’ kitchen, where she
made him a cup of tea. Soon the Pommy
Bride and Lever came down the passage.
“Thank you very much for looking after
me, Mrs. Clancy. I don’t know how I came
to be so stupid—it must have been the shock
of meeting an old friend.”
The Bride’s poise was not quite so con-
fident as heretofore, and there was a slight
flush in her pale face.
“I’m giving up my house —I’m going to be
married again, and live in the country. I
suppose I shall find it very strange at first
—not much chance of getting any servants
—not even a deceht ‘general,’ I expect.”
Mrs. Clancy paid her tribute.
“Oh, well, you may get someope to suit
you, mum. I ’ope you do.” she said.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
Our First Parents.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the hilltop church above the Ope River
the Samoan mission-teacher told us
of the Garden of Eden and the ser-
pent’s betrayal of our First Father.
All the native police, as is their custom
at compulsory church service, slept soundly
—all except Yaidei, the Binandele corporal.
No Christian he, but, like all the folk of the
Papuan Northland, a believer in spirits, good
and evil and of varying powers—Binei, as
he called them.
The old corporal listened attentively to
the story, but made no attempt to disguise
his dissatisfaction with the gospeller. In-
deed, disdain sat so heavily on his scowling
brow that when' the service was over I hur-
ried him off to the beach, on pretence of
overhauling the whaleboat. Once out of
hearing of the missionary, I left him to un-
buiden himself of his criticism, delivered in
the jargon known far and wide, in Papua
as Police Motu. It is here translated, for
writer’s and reader’s sake alike, into some-
thing moderately intelligible.
"This one Taparora, began Yaidei medi-
tatively, splitting a fat betel-nut with an
accustomed thumbnail, “too much he talk.
He think he savvy altogether that time firs -
fella man sit down longa New Guinea.
“He tellem senake wlns-a-per sinabada
[woman] she go catchem banana longa tree.
La-sij that one he no true. No senake there
that time; no sinabada there. Me plenty
savvy. More better you hearem me.
“Firs’'time man he come New Guinea he
no savvy garden. Big-fella Binei he been
makem garden longa small-fella islan’ —that
one close up longa Kumusi. Firs’-fella man
he plenty like New Guinea. Plenty kai:
plenty pig; all time he go sleep. Bymeby
little-fella Binei he come. He no good. He
sing out, wantem makem fight. ‘What for
you here?’ he talk; ‘this fella islan’ belonga
me. More better you go.’
“Firs’-fella man he plenty fright.
“Bymeby big-fella Binei he come back. He
talk. He say ‘What for you fright like-it
this?’ Firs’-fella man he say ‘Me no like;
too much kai, too much sit down; little-
fella Binei too much he sing out makem fight.
“Big-fella Binei he go ’way. He come
back, bringem plenty taro. ‘You makem
garden this one,’, he talk ; ‘plenty chopem tree,
plenty fire, plenty dig. More better you get-
em plenty work.’ That fella work he fright
little-fella Binei too much.
“Firs’-fella man he plantem taro, he go
sleep. Sun he come up, he go look. Taro
he altogether gone. Little-fella Binei he
come longa i he takem.
“Firs’-felia man he plenty sing out. Big-
fella Binei he come, he look. ‘ Doliori ,’ he
say; ‘nex’ time more better.’ 1
“Big-fella Binei he bringem plenty cocoa-
nut. ‘You plantem this one,’ he say.
“Firs’-f fella man he plantem cocoanut.
Sun he come up, lie go look. No cocoanut.
Little-fella Binei catch ’em.
“Big-fella Binei this time he plenty mad.
He sing out: ‘Me fight that little-fella
Binei; more better he look out quick. You
sit down, you stop.’
“Big-fella Binei bymeby he come back.
He bringem ’ooman he been makem. He
talk ’long firs’-fella. man; he say, ‘You
catchem this one. ’ooman ; he wife belonga
you. Supposem little-fella ; Binei he come
some more makem fight, this one wife be-
longa you she makem too much fright; no
more he come.
“Firs’-fella man he plenty like; he glad.
He plantem plenty taro, plenty cocoanut.
Bymeby plenty piccanin he come. Little-
fella Binei he no come. He fright; alto-
gether he finish.”
And as Yaidei said no more, but proceeded
to prepare a fresh chew of betel, I am con-
strained to believe that they all lived happ.ly
ever afterwards.
