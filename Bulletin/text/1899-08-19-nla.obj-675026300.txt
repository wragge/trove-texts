A Literary Mixture.
PE-jlHE Diet of Australian
| School Children / Geo.
...M . Robertson ; Sydney) is Dr.
Philip MuskettV sixth
book in less than six years; and
.it is time the well-intentioned
doctor rested. A book-child every
year will break down the
strongest literary constitution;
and Dr. Muskett’s was moder-
ately weak to commence with.
Most .of the message he. has to
deliver was given in “ The Art of
Living in Australia ” —the rest
has been chiefly recipes, reiter-
ation, and padding. Generally
speaking, it may be held that
Dr. Muskett has done a great
deal of good. He has denounced
undue meat-eating; praised light
wines as compared with heavy
beers; and compiled in readable form, with
especial reference to Australian conditions, a mul-
titude of useful health hints. What he should do
now is to condense his books for adults into a
single volume, instead of annually repeating him-
self. The preface to his “Book of Diet” closes
with an apology for haste and errors; and “The
Diet of School Children,” which has no apology,
needs one badly. Apparently, when the author
reached the end of his story at p. 140 he found his
book too short; for he has added twenty pages
which sayjmrocisely what he has said before, even
twice before —often in the same language. For
example—
Page xix. Page 138. Page 153.

This is the worst example of Dr. Muskett’s gri • ous

On p. 136 he repeats in identical language a >as-
sage on p. xviii. All through the book he iv eats
himself in different language. His 1.40 pp. book
and 23 prefatory pages could easily be boiled down
into 50 much more forcible pages, without omit-
ting one vital phrase or idea. It is the most slip-
shod piece of bookmaking seen locally since—
since Dr. Muskett’s previous book.
Nor, though the form be bad, is the matter
always good. Dr. Muskett has the same nostrum
for every kind of -constitution, performing every
variety of labour. He persists in reintroducing
MulhaU’s fallacy that Australians consume 2761b5.
of meat per head per annum—a figure which is cer-
tainly excessive, and for which there was never
any evidence. He abounds in careless statements
and unguarded quotations such as that “coffee
tends to strengthen the heart ” (p. 49), and
“Vogel . . . recommends coffee with cream* as a
tonic and valuable food to weakly children.”
If he had said that coffee tends to stimulate the
heart, and the moderate use of coffee, in some cases,
tends to strengthen the heart, the statement
would be. accurate. And though the moderate use
of coffee is beneficial to some weakly children—
sluggish, strumous children for example; yet for
many nervous,.febrile Australian children coffee is
rank poison if taken often or taken strong ;
and Dr. Muskett rightly says coffee should be
made strong—for adults who can stand it.
Dr. Muskett means so well, and says so many
useful things for people who can” make the
necessary qualifications and reservations, that
criticism has been twice postponed. But he
should really compile fewer books, and compile
them better.
Melb. University classics Prof. Tucker’s “ Criti-
cism of Australian Poetry” in July Review of
Reviews is constructed on the non-lucendo prin-
ciple—it criticises by,not criticising. Or, rather,
it does not cri ticise at all. The article lays down
various principles of criticism, some of which
seem sound and some debatable; but the only ap-
plication of his principles is to Mr. J. B. O’Hara’s
poetry, which cfoesn’t of itself justify the
caption. Prof. Tucker, in fact, seems to have
been so concerned to make his no - criticism
absolutely impartial that he has made it
almost absolutely bloodless and colourless. He
gets to close quarters with Mr. O’Hara, but he
beats the air in regard to Australian poetry. His
generalities have little force without an applica-
tion ; and Prof. Tucker cautiously—and wisely—
refrains from making applications. There is one
exception: he. shivers the timbers of Sladen and
his “ Century of Wooden Australian Song ” —ho !
he does smite Sladen ! But Sladen is slain : we
buried him a dozen years ago t : Prof. Tucker can’t
take his scalp, for fragments of it are mouldering in
a hundred wigwams already. When Mark Twain
was a mining reporter in California, he was
always very careful to say nothing against the
live shows which advertised in the paper: he
hit nothing .which coaid Jut back ; but now and
then, to show his perfect”'independence, he would
pick upon some old abandoned claim and give it a
blast of withering invective which made its'dry
hones rattle. That is precisely Prof. Tucker’s
method in his Review of Reviews article.

Apropos the Mendes-Vanor duel as to whether
Hamlet was literally “fat and scant of breath,”
Lond. Spectator recalled that, some seventy years

about.
Literature nutshells Nietzsche as moralist :
“ Nietzsche’s standpoint is simply this : that the
Christian morality of pity and brotherly kindness
is a mistake ; that what is excellent is individual
perfection of strength arid intensity of life, and
that each man should pursue this ideal -to the ut-,
most of his power regardless of social checks and
claims. ”

Bookfellow's Competitions.
VII.—WANTED—A TRIOLET.
The Bookfellow wants a triolet, which must have
a distinct Australasian reference. 10s. 6d. will be
paid for the best received by September 9. (The
required reference is a hamper, but need not be
much hamper if you consider that a triolet may
deal with love, war, politics, scenery, books, art,
music—anything.) The points considered in judg-
ing will be (1) force and interest generally ; (2)
technical quality as a triolet.
For information : The triolet comes from
France, source of so many joys. It has eight
lines and two rhymes ; in any measure. The
order of the rhymes is a, b, a, a, a, b, a, b, like
this —
Lines 1, 2, 7, 8 must be the same, and line 1 is re-
peated as line J (A punning change is often, in-
troduced, as in line 4 above, but it is a technical
blot on the triolet, though sometimes almost
justified by the result.)
The art of the triolet is, while using repeat-
lines, to do away with the sense of repetition. In
many so-called triolets lines 7 and 8 are surplus-
age : they add nothing to the thought or interest.
So the thing to do is to take base-lines which are
capable of construction in different ways of sense,
or sound, or grammar—or all three; and subtly
interweave the variations. The adverbial or
prepositional clause, which may be tacked on at
beginning or end of a main statement, is a
favourite opening—as in this by Robert Bridges—
When first we met, we did nob yuess
That Love would prove so hard a master;
Of more than common friendliness
When first we met we did not guess.
Wiio could foretell the sore distress.
This irretrievable disaster,
When first we met?—we did not guess
That Love would prove so hard a master.
The clause “When first we met” is the key
which opens these variations. But similar keys
are as numerous as writers’ ingenuities. Some use
exclamation to disguise the repeat—as F. G.
Bowles —
Suoh a lot to do !
Such a little time !
Hardly know who’s who—
Such a lob to do !
Simply hurry through;
Breathing is a crime—
Such a lot to do !
Such a little time 1
Italics help ; so does a subject which repeats natu-
rally, like street and theatre cries ; and punctua-
tion can be varied. A short line,'a light subject,
and a dainty touch seem to suit the triolet best;
but it can grapple seriously with passionate moods
and long metres -it is not solely “ a tiny trill of
epigrammatic melody turning so simply upon its
own innocent axis. ” And more information will
be found in Gleeson White’s collection of “Ballades
and Rondeaus ” (Canterbury Poets series; Is.) —a
little jewel of a book.

Hint s to Young Suicides.
IT is a cold-blooded Australian doctor
who sends these suggestions to The
Bulletin :
On the whole, the yearly number of suicides, in
proportion to population, hardly fluctuates—so far
as statistics go. In so many thousand people, so
many will die their own hands, just as among
all letters posGn during the year such-and-such a
number will be unaddressed or unstamped; so
many arrests in every hundred will be made ; and
so on. If an epidemic of suicide breaks out during
any period, and the average is over-topped, the
succeeding period will have a return lower than
the average. People will die by their own hand ;
but they usually die clumsily and painfully, when
a little knowledge would enable them to make
their quietus with grace and artistic refinement.
The advanced State of the future will provide a
means of exit from life for its disillusioned
children, and the Free Temple of Death will be as
much a Government institution as the Free Public
Library. The following article is to be regarded
as a professional summary of the objections which
a doctor feels upon viewing at a post-mortem ex-
amination the mangled and unpleasant corpse.
There may, after the recent examples, be a small
boom in potassium cyanide as an agent for self-
destruction ; but directly the public realises the
unsesthetic and indelicate results of that chemical,
there will be a slump. KCn. is rapid and cer-
tain ; but the swift heart-stoppage by which it acts
is produced by a gigantic spasm of acute agony,
and the staring eyes, foam-spattered lips, and
wrenched body, knock all the romance out of the
exit. No self-respecting modern suicide can afford
to overlook these drawbacks.
Deplorable lack of taste is evinced by the
majority of suicides. Popular physiology, and
the elementary anatomy taught in State-schools,
may do something to remedy the fault ; but until
the great public reaches a working knowledge of
the first principles of anatomy and toxicology,
it will go on as of yore cutting holes into the floor
of its mouth while searching for its carotid artery,
and absorbing boxes of rat-poison in tlie hope of
becoming a romantic and graceful corpse for its
family to weep over. Lovely woman contem-
plates a mind-picture of a‘ peaceful white face,
snowy hands, and clean underclothing, joined in
the calm sleep of death; takes an ounce of
strychnine (an objectionable drug if only from a
gustatory point of view); and in a few hours the
undertaker is swearing over a curiously-distorted
corpse which cannot be hammered into any coffin
in stock. Man, with fierce determination, lodges
a 22-calibre bullet from a cheap revolver in the.
back of his pharynx, blowing his mouth full of
powder-grains and bursting open his cheeks. After
a period in hospital he is fined 20s. for “attempted
suicide ” — i.e. , contributory negligence.
The decadent fin-de-sieale male suicide is
generally neat and certain. He approaches the
problem from the experimentor’s point of view,
and has usually tried it on the dog. Medical
suicides are naturally especially sure, although
absurd mistakes have been recorded. The quali-
fying examinations at all the great teaching centres
produce a regular crop of suicides—the medical
candidates, by virtue of profession, setting the
fashion of style and environment. Some years
ago, for instance, it beoame the rage among
Parisian students to shoot themselves while lying
beside a perfect lady. Until the fashion changed
such ladies were very shy of students about exam.-
time.
Now for methods: If poison be selected, the
irritants, corrosives and convulsants should be
eliminated at once. The cyanide series leaves
unpleasant signs. Narcotics form a favored class,
but not all narcotic agents are suitable. Lauda-
num and chloral often produce vomiting in the
tyro, and the preliminary delirium of cannabis
indica leads to discovery—and the stomach-pump.
Less-known poisons are hard to obtain, and may
cause error in tlie hands of laymen. Morphia is
distinctly the best; and tlie tiny tabloids in which
it is put up for hypodermic use form a very con-
venient medium either for oral or subcutaneous
exhibition. Twelve half-grain tabloids make an
effective but not extravagant dose by the mouth,
and possess a certain advantage in that an emetic,
followed by sgrs. potassium permanganate, will
prove an efficient antidote in case of second
thoughts. Morphia needs time for its action, but
a night is amply sufficient, and the bed-clothes are
not disturbed or stained.
Some prefer the knife. Let them observe the
golden rule and cut low. At the base of the neck
the carotids are easily reached (only one will pro-
bably be severed, but it is amply sufficient); and
by using a lieavy-bladed, razor-edged hunting-
knife the process is rapid and simple. A bath is
the best place in which to perform the operation,
as the resulting mess is considerable, and the
larger arteries throw a powerful jet. On no
account let the cut be higher than an inch below
the Adam’s apple; otherwise it means slow suffo-
cation by a flapping tongue or damaged larynx,
or . else aii ineffectual wound and an attack of
pneumonia.
Pistol ? A 42-cal. single-action long-barrelled
weapon has great advantages, though some prefer
a rifle or shot-gun. The pistol is easier to manage,
and quite as effectual The right auricle of the
heart is probably the best. situation, but diffi-
cult for the anatomical tyro to locate. The con-
cussion alone of the heavy cartridge from such a
pistol will produce the desired effect anywhere
about the heart region; but this is inartistic and
unscientific. If the head be favored—it is, per-
haps, safer—select the mouth an 1 fire well upwards
at a point about one inch in front of the uvula.
Some may prefer the outer surface of the skull,
in which case the bullet should be planted
about an inch-and-a-half above the orifice of
the ear, in a horizontal direction. A mirror
will be of service, arid the bathroom again
forms a fitting environment. The forehead
shot is unsuitable, and disfigures the face.
Accidents have frequently resulted from a temple

operator, in addition to smashing up his nasal

et; se lected, it should be made into the
i interspace between the ribs on the left side,
as close as possible, to the breast-bone, and directed
soin.w\ lat under it. This is more effective than
an attempt to reach tlie. apex, but error is easy ;
ana the stab is not to be recommended. A similar
situation on the right side is effective, but also un-
certain. Opening veins or arteries in a warm bath
lias its advantages, but the water is apt to get
cold, and the spectacle is unpleasant. Jumping
troin a height is exhilarating, but messy. Drown-
ing is not advised ; for, in addition to being a
disagreeable death, it necessitates a period of
fish-bait and watery decomposition, which is
decidedly detrimental to post-mortem appearance.
Charcoal fumes have great advantages, but. possess
a tell-tale odor, and may harm other people, a
fault which will put this method out of the ques-
tion with all right-thinking suicides.
To sum up : Use morphia or a well-selected
weapon (taking care, in the latter case, to go into
the bathroom), make sure of your anatomy, and
leave a letter in case of unfounded suspicion falling
on an innocent person. Beware of popular poisons
and, cheap revolvers ; don’t make a mess ; and
don’t alarm the neighbors more than can be
helped. And unless you are a single man or
woman with nobody dependent on you for
daily bread, or the victim of an incurable disease,
don’t do it at all ; but put up your hands for
another round and take your gruel as it comes.

some years under the prescription of Professor M'Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please acoept my hearty thanks, and remain yours

is a truss made on the plan of the above, with a heavy
steel or iron band, as you know if you have been in the
habit of wearing one. Throw it away ! Why will you con-

an iron hoop or steel spring about it, and one that may
be worn with ease and comfort both NIGHT and DAY !

Truss HAS ACCOMPLISHED THOUSANDS ! It is an
American Invention, made and sold for the past Twenty-
two years in America. It may now be had in Australia,
where it is performing most REMARKABLE CURES. It
is the only ELECTRIC TRUSS in the World 1 If ruptured,

The Fact that
it is impossible to ascertain the
quality of a plaster by a casual
examination should be a sufficient rea-
son for buying- a plaster with a repu-
tation.
There is no plaster that has been
before the public so long; none that
stands or ever stood so high; none
so well guaranteed, none whose
guarantee is so substantial and so
liberally interpreted; none so safe
to buy as an
Ail cock’s

I leoked at Bill,
Bill looked at me,
And then I looked at Bill;
Starvation had us in his claws—
Both me and Bill and Bill and me;
No profit had come to our cause,
And we were stony-broke.
I looked at Bill,
Bill looked at me,
And neither of us spoke.
We walked in silence round the block,
We were a handsome pair !
And then our nerves received a shock
As though our very fears to mock ;
Our man comes walking round the block
With hayseed in his hair.
I winked at Bill,
Bill winked at me,
And then Bill took his leave.
I sauntered on, Bill sauntered off,
Bill brushed his hair just like a toff,
I had no need to dress.
I tapped the “ country ” on his arm,
I spoke with my accustomed charm,
“ You’re Sammy Brown, I guess.”
I looked at him,
He looked at me,
He said, “ My name is Smith.”
I begged his pardon, he begged mine,
We wandered then apart.
I saw him further round the block;
Bill spoke to him, gave him a knock ;
I saw the stranger start.
Bill looked at him,.
He looked at Bill;
I cannot say Bill’s smart!
Bill begged his pardon, he begged Bill’s,
Bill came to me, alone.
He said he knew a man named Smith,
But his own name was “ Stone.”
I looked at Bill,
Bill looked at me,
And —we exchanged a groan !

Instead, I view the Maori rocks

Instead of oak I see the kau*

Instead of Saxon, hear the Mao*

Still do I love thee, oh, my As-

Yet here strange facts I can amass,
Which bid to truth defiance.
Effects I find of former cafc-

But now I go back to my Liz-

Oh, how I have enjoyed my Phys-

SATURDAY, AUGUST 19, 1899.
To Make Great Wealth, out of Nothing.
The mass of the people are not deeply in-
terested in banking problems, and when
The Bulletin desires to draw their atten-
tion to one by which Australia loses some
£500,000 a year, it only expects that a small
portion of an indifferent community will lend
part of its ear to the subject. Yet this paper
offers no apology for asking the loan of all
the ear which may be available. There are
mauy dark financial problems with a large
hole at the bottom of them through which
the public cash goes down into oblivion, and
in very many of them the hole might be
stopped up if the public would only under-
stand where the leakage is, and demand its
stoppage loudly enough. So long as the
public doesn’t study and doesn’t understand,
it can only relieve its feelings by general
incoherent execration. An attitude of
general curse towards “the banks” does
nothing and leads nowhere, and a feeble
desire to break into the banks and dance
with the muddy boots of revolution on the
big ledger doqs nothing-either.
* m * *
The five Australian provinces and Tas-
mania owe, among them, about £185,000,000
in public debts alone, and the average rate
of interest is about 3f per cent. There are
constantly lying idle in the banks about
£18,000,000 in gold, and if, say, £13,000,000
of this could be used to help in paying off
this debt, without dislocating business, or
destroying confidence, or breaking any-
thing, it would obviously save something
very close on £500,000 a year in interest.
It might save even more than that if
it were judiciously applied to pay off
the older and higher-prioed loans. The
money at present earns nothing. It
»es in the bank strong-rooms, and is
either periodically looked at by the auditor,
or else taken on trust by the auditor. It is
there as a precaution against a possible run
on the bank by depositors ; so long as it is
there the depositors probably won’t run ; if
they knew that it wasn’t there, and that
thei’e was nothing there instead of it which
would answer the purpose, they would pro-
bably run with such fury that there would
be murder and sudden death in the doorway.
This great mass of idle cash is there bo
“ inspire confidence,” and in view of the fact
that the money represents a dead loss of
£675,000 a year, it is a very expensive way
of inspiring the substance in question. It
is worth considering whether confidence
couldn’t be inspired at a much cheaper rate.
* * * *
The experience of Canada certainly appears
to show that it could be done. The Austra-
lian banks have, in Australia and Tasmania,
£83,000,000 of deposits, and as security
for any sudden run on these they hold
£18,000,000 in gold. The Canadian banks
have about £52,000,000 of deposits, and
against them they hold £1,830,000 in gold.
But they also hold £3,488,000 in State
notes, which answer equally well, and it is
the want of this cheap, State-guaranteed
currency which makes Australian banking
the ruinous thing it is. Canada settled the
currency question in a courageous, off-hand
fashion, by enacting that every bank must
keep at least 40 per cent, of its cash reserves
in the notes of the Federal Government.
As a matter of fact it could have made it
compulsory to hold 65 per cent, of the re-
serves in State paper, for the banks do hold
that proportion with no trouble or damage.
And—what seems not a little remarkable--
this has been done without destroying the pri-
vate note issues of the banks, which are still
large. If the cheap and useful Canadian
system, as it is actually worked in Canada, was
introduced in Australia, a Federal Govern-
ment could obtain from the banks £13,000,000
in gold, and replace it by Federal notes, and
still leave them with a stronger reserve of
coin, in proportion to their liabilities, than
the Canadian banks find necessary. And if
that £13,000,000 was used to reduce the
country’s foreign debt as the loans fall due
it would make an annual saving of £500,000
a year in interest.
♦ * * *
Only a Federal Government, of course,
could do such a transaction. At present no
Government can issue paper which is good
outside its own narrow limits, therefore gold
is wanted to carry on the vast exchange
operations among the separate provinces.
When there is a Federal Government whose
paper will be good all over Australia, then
gold will only be wanted to pay
debts outside Australia. For internal
operations, State-guaranteed paper will do
just as well, and there will be so much less
coin to serve as a bait in some possible time
of war to the invader, who will want an
indemnity. A badly - defended country,
remote from assistance, with £18,000,000
of gold lying conveniently in its banks to pay
ransom with, is a huge bait for an invader.
The banks would lose nothing by the deal ;
so long as the law made £5,000,000 in gold
and £13,000,000 in State-paper as good
security to pay their depositors with as
£18,000,000 in gold, they could sit behind
the big polished counter and await the pos-
sible run with as much equanimity as here-
tofore. And if the money obtained was
used to reduce the public debt, there
would be no possibility of the supply
of gold for foreign exchange purposes
running short. Interest has to be paid in
coin, therefore this transaction would reduce
the outflow of gold by £500,000 a year, and
with £500,000 a year less gold going out,
and with the Australian mines turning out
the yellow metal at their usual rate, the
reserves of coin would accumulate again
rapidly. A Federal Government, by this one
deal, could reduce the public expenditure by
£500,000 a year. If it converted the re-
mainder of the public debts into a uniform
3 per cent. Federal stock, it could save
nearly £1,500,000 a year more in interest,
which would mean, in all, £2,000,000 a year
less expenditure and £2,000,000 a year less
gold leaving this country annually. And if
it had courage enough then to swear off all
borrowing, and either spend the £2,000,000
on public works itself, or allot it among the
States as a public works fund, Australia might
be surprised to find itself a solvent country
again, and able to live entirely on its own
resources.
* * * *
It is only by Federation that these two
great financial operations can be carried out.
No single State could work such a scheme.
It is a process whereby, practically, a vast
sum of money will be made out of abso-
lutely nothing. The only difference to the
community would be that it would, to a
great extent, draw its salary on Saturday in
the shape of one note and 16s. in silver,
instead of one sovereign and 16s. in silver.
In a vague sort of way it might learn at
times that there were £5,000,000 of gold
and £13,000,000 of State paper in the vaults
of the banks, and remark to itself, as it occa-
sionally does now, that banks are bloated
institutions- which live by grinding the
faces of the poor ; but the change would
not be noticeable. A great part of it
wouldn’t observe for years that it always got
a note on Saturday in place of getting a
sovereign sometimes and a bit of paper at
others ; and wouldn’t notice for some more
years that the bit of paper had the super-
scription of the Federal Government on its
face. Almost certainly in half-a-dozen
years the huge gold output of Australia,
when so much less of it was drained off to
England annually in payment of interest on
the public debt, would make the yellow coin
as plentiful again to all appearance as it is
now. The banks would probably protest at
first, for banks are conservative institutions,
but the experience of Canada shows that the
State paper experiment is absolutely feasible,
and that the big institutions which recon-
struct now and then can live under that
system as well as any other. So The Bul-
letin returns the public its ear uninjured
with many thanks for the loan, and with
this moral. There is an immense amount of
money to be made out of Federation-
money which can’t be made in any other
way —provided the people work the Federal
machine to the best advantage. And if the
people will, for once, take an intelligent
interest in a dry problem of finance they will
find their attention well repaid in cash.
More Snake.
The Bulletin receives a letter :
Dear Bulletin.— Re “the Snake of Religious Dissen-
sion ” and State-schools. You make some remarks
which—to quote the aentle Belle of New York —“ almost
tempt me to say ‘ Rubbish ’! ” The population of Vic-
toria is classified by the statist as 23 per cent. Catholic
and 77 per cent. Protestant and sundries. The sundries
include some Chows, Indian hawkers, and Jos. Symes. It
is true that “the Victorian religious community is
divided into two great classes —Catholics and Protestant,”
as you say—but why dodge the point that 75 per cent, of
the whole community is non-Catholic ? The whole of the
Catholic minority is religious, fearfully and wonderfully
so, from the average “Protestant’s” point of view,
whereas the bulk of the un-Catholic majority is not
religious. Nevertheless there is everywhere among the
adults of that majority a feeling in favor of a little formal
religious instruction for their children at school. They
believe that “ the singing of a hymn, the saying of a
prayer, the reading of the Bible”' would have a good—
certainly not a bad —influence on the youngsters’ moral
characters, and they wonder why the matter can’t be
arranged with the approval of the Catholics. You say—
“ But. the Catholics have their own hymns, say their own
prayers, read their own Bible. Anything else is
anathema ; and their conscientious objection will have
force.” I say give the children the hymn “Lead,
Kindly Light,” composed by R.C. Cardinal Newman, who
’verted from the Protestant church. As for the differ-
ence between the R.C. Bible and prayers and the Protes-
tant ditto, surely sectarian differences can be avoided
in the selection of passages. What’s the Catholic objec-
tion to the Cardinal's hymn aforesaid, the psalm begin-
ning “ The Lord is my shepherd,” which one gets from
the gramophone funnel at a public entertainment, and
the parables of the Talents, the Good Samaritan, and the
Prodigal Son ? Again, I ask, what is the Catholic objec-
tion to the reading in State schools of passages from
Scripture that are common to both sects, always provided
that they be read from a paper as quotations from com-
mon Scripture, and not from a Bible ? Can you show a
reasonable objection, and if unreasonable, is there any
reason why the majorit3 r should be “ bluffed ” by the
Catholic minority? You say “HDbakin and his fol-
lowers want religion taught, let them teach it in their
homes and in their churches,” but they don’t want
religion taught with the same furious persistency as is
shown by the Catholics, who are “always refusing to
send their children to‘godless’ schools, and always,
where possible, establishing their own schools” ( vide
Bulletin) for the maintenance of Catholic dogmas. The
great unbigoted majority ask only for a scholastic recog-
nition of an Immortal Power, and a few admirable exam-
ples of ancient Christian literature, and when you say
“directly so-called ‘unsectarian’ instruction is intro-
duced, the Catholic complaint is justified,” you talkwhat
the majority regard as “ rubbish”—and sectarian rubbish
at that.— Simple Poser.
* * * *
The Bulletin presumes this letter may be
taken to exemplify the sentiments and arguments
of the average religious-heathen to whom religion
is not a vital matter like dinner; but who vaguely
believes in religious education because it is En-
glish, you know, and Respectable, and the thing
he has been accustomed to in the old home. And
the writer of the letter is known to this paper as a
man of brains and education, so he may be pre-
sumed to have put the religious-heathen’s best
foot forward. Yet his letter is five parts ground-
less assumption, and three parts characteristic
non-comprehension. Two parts show glimmer-
ings of reason.
* * * *
“ Simple Poser ” assumes that “there is every-
where among the adults of the Vic. Protestant
majority a feeling in favor of a little formal reli-
gious instruction for their children at school.”
The Bulletin assumes that there is not. One
assumption is as good as the other. But in favor
of The Bulletin’s assumption are the facts that
the Vie. majority have established and upheld
secular education; and that in the neighboring
province of S.A. —where the religious proportions
are much the same as in Victoria—the agitation
for religious teaching recently had its neck wrung
at a referendum.
* * * *
“Simple Poser ” says this paper talks what the
majority regards as “Rubbish.” Well, this paper
says “Simple Poser” talks what the majority re-
gards as “ Rubbish.” One “Rubbish ”is as good
as another. Till the majority vote, nobody knows
how they will vote. Guesses waste time. Mud
wastes space.
* * * *
“ Simple Poser ” gives the hymn he likes, and
the passage of Scripture he likes. He has omitted
to forward the prayer he habitually uses when he
comes home broke from the races or warm from
the leg-show; and he doesn’t guarantee that his
“ like ” will be the majority’s “ like.” He cannot.
He does not even guarantee that his “ like ” will
be adopted. He cannot. It is easy to erect a
harmless Aunt Sally, and say : “ What a beauti-
ful old lady ! How moral! How improving !
Let the youngsters have a shy at her. If it does
them no good, it will do them no harm. Shame
on the people who would abolish my innocent
Aunt Sally ! Down with the non-religious
heathen and his fetish ! ”
* * * *
The trouble is that Aunt Sally has less to do
with the case than the wattle that blooms in the
Spring. Whatever the hymn selected, it is not at
all likely to be “Lead, kindly light”—for the
reason that “Lead, kindly light,” though an
excellent mystical poem for adults of a certain
temperament, is quite unintelligible to most
children without explanation, or even with ex-
planation. Anyway, explanation is barred by the
hypothesis. “The Lord is my shepherd,” is
similarly unintelligible unless taken as the imagin-
ative outpouring of an ancient Israelite, and con-
strued imaginatively. “Simple Snoozer’s ” ex-
treme simplicity is shown by the calm way in
which he provides for the tender shoot religious
nourishment which many grown trees cannot
assimilate. If he were a school teacher he would
know better. The Bulletin would be quite
satisfied to let the question of Vic. religious
education be decided by a vote of school teachers.
They know what a farce it is to parrot sacred
poetry in the intervals of geography and arith-
metic to an audience of children—the most un-
mitigated heathens extant.
The trouble is also that Aunt Sally would not
come under the guise of a meaningless hymn or a
mysterious parable. The people who want religious
education would—very properly—not be satisfied
with the colorless unintelligibilities which “ Same
old Snoozer ” proffers. They would want vital
truths —that is to say, dogmas and creeds; and
they would not be happy till they got them. Vic.
experience alone has shown that.
* * * *
Further, unless an exact statement of the hymn
and the prayer are given on the referendum-paper,
there is no knowing that a majority approves of
them. Certainly a minority will disapprove. It
is not the State’s business to offend the religious
convictions or no-convictions even of a minority.
There is good ground for State education
•experience has shown that, though education may
not make good citizens, ignorance makes bad
citizens ; and bad citizens hurt the State. State
education is State self-protection. As long as the
State confines itself to matters of known fact it is
safe. There can be no dispute about the teaching
that two and two make four, or that the Wradvt
weather nuisance will spread if Wradvt-junior is
added to Wradvt-senior at Mt. Whiskyusco. But
it is not the State’s business to affirm that there
exists “an Immortal Power.” The State is con-
structed to look after society in this world, and
in is as ignorant as anybody else about what is
beyond this world. Experience shows that the
State has always got along much better when it
laid to its book.
* * * *
“Simple Poser” triumphantly points out that
his hymn and his Scripture are so colorless as to
mean nothing in particular. That is to say, they
are husks. The reason is eminently creditable to
the Catholics. They believe that religion is a
vital matter, and they are not satisfied to have it
put before their children as if it was an illegiti-
mate baby on a doorstep. Consequently they
have their own schools, where they can teach
adequately the religion in which they believe. If
Protestants like “Simple Poser” did their duty
by their religion, they would have their own
schools too. But that logical person wants to
shirk teaching a red-hot religion calculated to do
some good, and he wants to make Catholics pay
for teaching even the cold-potato religion which is
all he cares about. Suum cuique —which means,
let every sect teach its own religion, and let the
State schools teach grammar and spelling.
This article is another chunk sawn off a large
subject; but the long and the short of the subject
is this. It is expedient for the State to see that
all its children are taught the common subjects of
education, upon which there is no disagreement.
While it teaches those only, no sect has an excuse
for complaining. As soon as it starts teaching
somebody’s pet hymn, or pet prayer—even if it
goes no farther —it gives just ground for complaint
by all who dislike that hymn or that prayer, or
who dislike to hear it mumbled on a wet morning
by a cold teacher with all his work cut out to
keep the class up to the inspector’s standard in
sums, and realising that hymn and prayer do no
good, and take so much time out of the working-
day. And, even if there did not exist churches
and parents to teach hymns and prayers, the State
has no business, by trenching one inch on the de-
batable ground of religion, to exclude from its
schools the children of people who object to go
that one inch. The State schools are for the whole
community; and no religious conscience - test
should be permitted to shut out one single indi-
vidual. We can all agree about sums.
The N.S.W. Labor Party.
The N.S. W. Parliamentary Labor-party is in
a pretty bad way. From about 30 members
in ’9O it has got to 19 in ’99 —and it is
more or less doubtful whether it has all
of them. Of these 19, the great majority
were lately not able to persuade their
constituents to take the same view that they
took of the biggest question that has ever
arisen in Australian politics. Fifteen Labor
constituencies voted on the question in pre-
cisely the way that 17 of the Labor members
told them not to, on any account. The two
members who did go as 15 out of 19 Labor
constituencies in N.S.W. went, and as every
other Labor constituency so far appealed to
elsewhere has gone, have before and since
been branded as “traitors.” Meantime,
the other 17 are as happy as sick black-
fellows ; mostly one section of them is
engaged calling other sections pet names.
Holman is bludgeoning the “official Labor
organ the official Labor organ is bludgeoning
Holman. Sleath, reckoned one of the most
extreme of the members, declares in a burst of
frankness that the men who are running the
movement make him tired of it. Nobody
knows precisely what the “Labor” policy is;
and there is altogether as much confusion
as one would naturally expect in a party whose
“leader” was chosen because other brighter
men were too jealous of one another to clionse
anybody else. Most leaders make themselves ;
but, under caucus rule, if one man, feeling
himself, begins to move lie is laid on the broad
of his back and sat upon. Sometimes he sub-
mits ; sometimes he doesn’t. The only ones
who don’t get sat on are good-natured, com-
plaisant fellows like Cann, who, when they
can’t agree with the caucus, go home and say
nothing about it; and the harmless nonentities
like and and But the list
is too long for publication;
* * * *
The party was born of the big strike of ’9O.
It swept one or two of the old four-seat Sydney
electorates and several in the country ; and, as
it looked as if it were in for a good time, it
soon had a following. But the heat of ’9O did
not last, and the following soon began to
slacken its energy. The party had, for one
thing, vowed to sink the fiscal issue; but it
presently dawned on some people that the party
wasn’t doing anything of the sort —that all the
time it was keeping up either one end of the
log or the other. The people who wanted the
other end kept up kicked; and every time the
party changed ends (in conformity with the
squeeze-and-ehuck policy) some supporters and
seats were lost—which probably has something
to do with the steady thick-and-thin support
given for years to Wriggler Reid. Besides,
there is hardly a member of the present party
who is a confessed Protectionist, while about a
dozen frankly avow themselves Freetraders.
But they still go on sinking the fiscal
issue ; and they still go on pretending to ex-
pect working-men Protectionists to vote for
them.

Fifteen out of 19 Labor constituencies would


not take the almost unanimous advice of the
party on Federation. Whom, then, do the
Labor 19 represent at all ? Whose policy is the
Labor policy—who makes it ? The Political
Labor League is boss; and it represents a
working man here and there. Labor unions,
which are the best agencies to secure working
men’s salvation yet contrived, comprise only a
small percentage of workmen—not a seventh of
the total in N.S.W.— and of this less than
seventh about one in a dozen takes any interest
in the P.L.L. It gives no dividend, no bonus,
no sick-pay ; it doesn’t even offer a chance
in an “art” union ; and so it is passed.
Of the few outside the bush-unions who do
interest themselves in the P.L.L., about
one - third are talkative gentlemen with
ambitions (and there were only four M.L.C.
appointments among so many !), one-
third are mostly bitter men with grievances,
and one-third are fine, whole-hearted reformers,
with whom this paper hereby shakes hands,
wishing them well. In the bush unions, the
reformer section may be extended to, say, a
half of the total. Skite, bitterness, and
earnestness are thus associated ; and earnest-
ness doesn’t get more than half a chance.
Still, whatever results is put down to the
Labor-party. After all, then, it isn’t wonder-
ful that when it comes to a popular appeal to
the ballot, that policy and that party are no-
where. See what it did about Federation. First,
it adopted a platform which a few extremists
here and there conscientiously approved. Then
it nominated a full ticket of ten men to
fight for that platform. In every other pro-
vince it was proposed to run Labor candidates ;
but, instead of agreeing upon an Australian
Labor Federal policy, the N.S. W. party fixed
up one for itself away ahead of all the rest.
Running ten candidates, it also rendered
alliances impossible; and so it got no repre-
sentation at all. These members, or a majority
of them, still declare that the only acceptable
brand of Federation is their brand, and they
try to stop others getting any other brand.
Being few in numbers, they fail, of course, and
so they waste their whole force. They do not
realise that compromise spells political pro-
gress ; yet until they do, or until they
have a majority of their own, they must
go down every time that they don’t fluke
a win. They are careful, however, never
to get a majority, because they regard it
as incumbent on them to always keep ahead
of the crowd. So the Labor-party, if it keeps
on these lines, will never do'anything itself—
it will always be away ahead. When a man
among them, seeing a chance to gain something
that has been fought for, stops to do it, he will
be fired out as “ bogus.” And as most men of
much account do want to do something off their
own bat, most men of much account will be
fired out. Also, though administration is
often quite as important as legislation, it will
never get a chance to administer. That is, if
the party goes on these present lines. But in
that case it will not be a Labor-party at all;
it will continue to represent, as it does now,
mostly a few voluble extremists, many of whom
are not working-men at all. And because The
Bulletin wants to see a party really repre-
senting the grafters of the community, and
because at one time the Labor-party promised
to be that party, it writes these things in sor-
row, yet in hope.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Resources of this Great Country.
The anti-Bill meeting held last week in Bris-
bane naturally brought up old Hugh Nelson
with the weary invariable tale about the
Resources of this Great Country. No anti-
Federal meeting up North, or anywhere else,
is complete without some old inhabitant
babbling about the Resources of this Great
Country. Nelson’s theory was the one which
is always babbled about ou such occasions—that
owing to the extraordinary and unprecedented
resources of this great country Queensland can
get on perfectly well by itself, and that for a
place of such unparalleled resources to federate
with any other place would be practically an
insult to its Creator. Therefore, Hugh Nelson
urged Queensland, as a place of stupendous
resources, to go on its separate way as here-
tofore. Poor old Nelson is one of the
very large crowd which thinks that debt is the
same thing as wealth. Queensland has never
yet attempted to live on its own resources, so
how it would pull through on them is an abso-
lutely unknown quantity. It has borrowed,
publicly and privately, about .£60,000,000, and
had a giddy revel on the proceeds. Its exist-
ence has been a giddy revel from the very
beginning. It has now to send away annually
about £2,649,000 in interest to foreign money-
lenders and absentees, and it is borrowing more
per head than any other province, bar Wes-
tralia, to help meet this bill. Coghlan, the one
Australian statistical authority who deals sys-
tematically with the figures of all Australia,
publishes some harrowing tables on pages 430
and 433 of his “Seven Colonies” for 1898,
showing that Queensland is the most deeply-
indebted place, in proportion to population, in
Australasia—and also in the world. Even the
most profligate of the other provinces doesn’t get
within gunshot of the boss profligate up North.
It is mortgaged from one end to the other to
the financiers of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney,
and London. It has made a spell of artificial
prosperity by building railways with borrowed
money till it is the most-railw'ayed country, in
proportion to population, in the world, Wes-
tralia only excepted, but its railway system is
lamentably unprofitable as compared with
those of Westralia, South Australia, N.S.W.,
or Maoriland. It is a great gold country, yet
it has only in one year got ahead of Victoria as
a gold producer, and Victoria is just about one-
eighth its size. It is about as fertile as any
other part of Australia on an average, and as
dry as any other place, and as tired. But there
is nothing extraordinary about its resources.
The country has never managed to live
on them yet, and what will happen when
it has to make the attempt—it can’t do
another 40 years of borrowing like the
last 40 or it will burst with a loud report —
there is no precedent to show. Queensland is
accustomed to brag a good deal about its gold
production, but it has borrowed—in public and
private borrowings—more than the value of all
the gold it has turned out since it first began !
It has borrowed as much as the value of all the
gold, silver, copper, tin and coal it lias pro-
duced up to date !! It has borrowed, publicly
and privately, as much as the value of all the
wool it has produced up to date !! ! It has
borrowed more than the value of all its agricul-
tural and manufactured products up to date.
Its great industries have been : (1) Borrowing;
(2) wool; (3) gold-mining. So when Hugh
Nelson assumes that Queensland’s progress in
the past is proof that it can safely rely on its
own great resources and doesn’t require any
Federation, he is a foolish old man talking
through a very demented hat. Queensland
has never even attempted to rely on its own re-
sources so far.
Victorian Prison Horrors.
Hume Cook, M.L.A., on Victorian prisons :
It is within the power of the governor of the gaol to
give a man two days’ solitary confinement for any offence.
... It is within the power of the visiting justices to give
a man two years in irons, 30 days’ solitary treatment, or
30 days’separate treatment. . . . The prisoner is brought
before the visiting justices in the office, or some place of
the kind, at the prison, and the only persons present are
the warder who accuses him, the governor perhaps, and
the visiting justice. What sort of fair play can a prisoner
get? . . . Case A was sentenced in 1890 to eight years’
penal servitude for robbery. For two years after that
man was sent to prison he committed no offence what*
ever; he was not guilty of the slightest breach
of the prison regulations or the prison disci-
pline. At the end of that time, one Sunday
morning, he refused to go to church. I would draw’
particular attention to the fact that this occurred
on a Sunday morning, because the prisoners are locked
up on Saturday at 12 o’clock, and remain in close con-
finement for 20 hours, whereas 13 hours is the longest
time for which they are confined on other days. The
man refused to go to church because, as he said, he was
not well. On the following Monday morning he admitted
his error and promised that if he was not punished he
would commit no other breach of the regulations. The
fact that for two years that man committed no offence
may be accepted as proof of his desire to get out of gaol
as soon as possible. He received for this offence two
days’ solitary confinement, and for disobedience
of orders two days’ separate treatment. After that,
his various sentences amounted to 34 months 57
days cumulative punishments, making in all about
11 years instead of the 8 years for which he was
sentenced, and 9 months 133 days concurrent punish-
ment. The concurrent punishments consisted of im-
prisonment in irons, solitary treatment, and separate
treatment, with their accompanying disabilities of low
diet and lack of exercise and privileges In the
second case, B was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment.
He has served 9 years, and has 18 months more to run.
Think of any mere justice, an individual
generally ignorant of law, and appointed
mainly for the purpose of fining drunks 55.,
being allowed to sentence an undefended
prisoner, in secret, to 7J years’ imprisonment,
with irons, solitary, low diet and other horrors
thrown in ! According to Hume Cook the Vic.
Government has lately invented another ghastly
idea, but this one isn’t intended as a punish-
ment ; it is merelj' an economy. No prisoner
serving a sentence of less than 12 months is
now allowed a light in his cell, so in the winter
he puts in 13 or 14 hours out of every 24 in
total darkness ! As a picturesque horror that
almost “ lays over ” the J.P.

.Reasonably Supposed to be Stolen.
Instructive item from S.M. Herald of Btli
August, 1899 :
At Paddington Police Court on Thursday James
MTntyre was sentenced to 14 days’ imprisonment on a
charge of having property in his possession supposed to
have been stolen. Our report of the case was read by the
person from whom the articles were purchased. He
communicated with the authorities, and the innocence
of the accused being shown MTntyre was at once
liberated.
This seems a fair text on which to base the old
question : Isn’t it time that every allegedly
civilised country abolished the practice of gaol-
ing persons for having property about them
“reasonably supposed to be stolen”? The
practice is as unjust and illogical as would be
that of hanging people for the murder of some-
body reasonably supposed to be dead—some-
body whose body wasn’t found and regarding
whom there was no conclusive evidence that he
had ever been alive. The whole theory of
goods “ reasonably supposed to be stolen ” is
just this : A zealous policeman stops somebody
who looks poor enough and uninfluential
enough to be run-in with impunity, and asks
how he became possessed of something.
Probably if he is very poor his proper-
ties are so old that he bought them
years ago in some other province, and it
is impossible to bring evidence about their
origin. Probably he explains their origin and
the policeman decides, on the evidence of his
own inward bobby, that the statement isn’t
true. The prisoner is run in. If he has ex-
plained where he got the article, and the
alleged seller is available, probably that
alleged seller isn’t communicated with—by the
police, at all events. The. prisoner, as a rule,
gets no chance to communicate with him on
his own account. Sometimes it is mentioned
in the papers that the police want an owner
for an old silver watch or some other properly
supposed to have been stolen, which is a direct
invitation for somebody who wants a cheap
watch to claim the article and swear the man
on whom it was found into prison.. And if no
owner or alleged owner can be found, and if it
can’t be shown that any such arLicle was stolen
from anybody, and there is no evidence of theft
whatever, then the charge is laid of being
possessed of goods which a policeman thinks,
or says he thinks, were dishonestly come by,
said policeman being unable to show any good
legal reason for his thinking. In short, the
charge is one of being a person who, in a
policeman’s opinion, looks like a person who
might have stolen something—which is much
the same as the charge of looking the way
Bonaparte might have looked if he hadn’t
looked the way he did look. “ Reasonably
supposed to be stolen ” is often just as logical as
burying a live man on a police charge of being
reasonably supposed to be dead.
Parliament and Referendum.
B. R. Wise :
One of the lessons of the Federal campaign is that
government by Referendum means government by news-
papers. By the introduction of the Referendum, they got
rid of legislation by responsible representatives of the
people. They gave up the government of the country to
people whom they did not know, and who were respon-
sible to no one, anti took it out of the hands of those who
were answerable. For his part he would rather
be governed by the worst Parliament than by the best
newspaper in the world.
B. R. Wise is steadily ripening into a fine
illogical Tory. This is his case cub up into
short lengths for convenience of carriage :
Government by Parliament means that one set of news-
papers calls furiously to the people to elect Smith because
he will vole for somethin}', and another set calls to them
to elect Jones because he will vote against something.
And the dazed, newspaper-ridden community finally
elects Smith.
Government by Referendum means that the same
newspapers call to the same people to vote for or against
the same thing directly, without the intervention of Jones
and Smith.
The Referendum gets rid, on certain points, of “ govern-
ment by responsible representatives of the people,” as
Mr. Wise says. And it substitutes government by the
responsible people themselves. In other words, instead
of Mr. Wise’s responsible office-boy conducting the great
case in which Mr. Wise is briefed, and being responsible
to Mr. Wise if he muddles it (which is little consolation
to anybody after it is muddled), Mr. Wise conducts the
case himself.
_ If the Federal Constitution had been adopted by Par-
liament, only, it would have been a case of the newspapers
yelling in the ears of Brown, M.L.A., and Smith, M.L.A.,
that they should do this or that if they didn’t want to be
utterly lost at next election, and also calling to the
people to fire out Brown and Smith if they didn’t
do this and that. And furthermore, Brown and
Smith, being just ordinary people like any others,
would be swayed in their own opinions by the
papers as much as any other people would be. Brown,
M. L.A., and Smith, M.L.A., would be guided partly by
the conscientious opinions that they borrowed from the
newspapers, and partly by what the newspapers told them
that the people wanted, and by what the newspapers told
them would happen to them at next election if they did,
or if they didn’t. And the people, with their opinions
largely borrowed from the newspapers, would be trying
to explain to Brown, M.L.A., and Smith, M.L.A., what
they wanted them to do, and the newspapers would act
as interpreters, and tell Brown and Smith what the people
wanted them to do. Only one set of newspapers would
tell Brown and Smith that the people vv.\ ited them to do
one thing, and the other set would tell them that the
people wanted the other thing.
And by the Referendum the people, with their opinions
largely borrowed from the newspapers, state exactly and
beyond all mistake what they do want.
The Referendum is B. R. Wise, barrister, stating his
case to the Judge. And Parliamentary Government is
B. R. Wise hiring another man to state his case, and not
allowed to tell him till three years afterwards (at next
general election) that he is stating it all wrong, but ges-
ticulating frantically in the background, while the editor of
the Herald tells Mr. Wise’s deputy that Mr. Wise is going
on like that in pure rage and frenzy at his deputy’s foolish-
ness, and the editor of the Telegraph tells the deputy
that B.R.W. is prancing about in that awful manner
through sheer joy at his agent’s cleverness.
In short, the Referendum is largely government by the
newspapers telling the people what they should do.
And Parliamentary government is government by the
newspapers telling Parliament what it should doj and
telling the people what they should make Parliament do,
and what they should do to Parliament if it doesn't, do
it, and also telling Parliament what the people want it to
do, and generally acting as a wrong interpreter all round.
Anyhow, B. R. Wise’s cheerful readiness to live under
the worst Parliament existing will probably die away be-
fore long. He probably doesn’t know how bad the worst
Parliament can be.
“Jack Shay ” makes a very straight-out state-
ment :
At Darlington (Sydney) in March last there died of
poison—whether self-administered or not there was no
evidence to show—one Leddy, who had some time before
bought a burial-allotment in the R.C. cemetery, and had
erected on it a tombstone bearing his name, date of
birth, &c., with the usual blank for date of demise and
age thereat. Deceased had not been particular as to
what church he patronised, and “ shuffling off ” rather
suddenly had not been attended in his last moments by
any clergyman. Consequently the R.C. authorities—
presumably consideiing him a suicide—refused to allow
him to be buried in the (paid-for) allotment. But,
as it turned out at the annual meeting of the St.
Mary’s R.C. Cathedral management on June 4, 1899
(Daily Telegraph, June 5) that “ under the will
of the late Mr. Leddy a sum of £2500 was ex-
pected immediately”—it was thereafter announced in
the parish in which Leddy died that at the expiration of
the regulation 12 months from interment, Leddy’s re-
mains will be exhumed, and, with bell, book and candle,
solemnly re-interred in his purchased plot of consecrated
ground. All which, summed-up, amounts to this : The
R.C. Church—having in the first instance declared, by
implication, that Leddy, being unfit for burial in conse-
crated ground, had gone straight toSheol—now consents,
in consideration of the sum of £2500, to reverse his sen-
tence of damnation ; and thus shamelessly discounts the
value of its pronouncements upon—from its own point of
view—the most important of all questions. Perhaps
when Cardinal Moran has finished with the mote in the
Protestant missions’ eye he may look into and have
something to explain about this tremendous beam in
Holy Church’s own optic.
The Bulletin, which, of course, does not
vouch for the allegations here set out, will be
glad to have the other side of the Leddy case,
if there is any.
—♦
Editor Bulletin. —Sir, — Re your comments
on the sentences passed by the Hobart justices
on two prisoners who escaped from gaol and
were recaptured (B. 5/5/’99), the following
passage in the preface to “Readiana” (Charles
Reade) seems peculiarly apposite :
I find I have gone a little beyond the mark in calling
the execution of Murdoch illegal. It is not prima-facie
illegal to hang a riian who kills an officer in the discharge
of his duty, but in this country law goes by precedent;
Murdoch garotted the gaoler, not with the intention of
killing him, but of escaping while the gaoler was dis-
abled for a time. The desire for liberty is as natural
and overpowering as hunger, and the prisoner acted
upon it with no murderous intention whatever.
He never left the neighborhood, sure proof he
did not know he had killed the gaoler ; and went into
tears when he heard the old man was dead. The people
who at that date misgoverned this nation had tempted
Murdoch to the act by leaving Hastings gaol insufficiently
guarded. When they hung the youth they had tempted
—hung him to hide their own fault —the spectators of the
execution were fewer than ever assembled to see a hang-
ing before or since, and the only cry that came from this
handful of spectators was “Murder! Murder!!” Just
three months after this butchery, an escaped prisoner
was brought before a Judge ; the Judge was invited by
the Crown to inflict condign punishment; he treated the
proposal with contempt. “ The prisoner," said he,
“ yielded to the natural and imperious desire of liberty.
It was his business to escape, and it was the gaoler’s busi-
ness not to let him.”
The underlining is mine.—J.D.P., Barberton,
Transvaal, 21/6/’99.

N.S.W. Labor-member Josiah Thomas, who
went over to Westralia to explain why his
party was against Federation in N.S.W. :
Of course we are in favor of direct taxation. Conse-
quently Federation will mean to us, instead of direct
taxation, a greater amount of taxation than we are
having at present. That is the reason why we object to
the financial portion of the Bill. It is not that we are
afraid of our surplus being taken by necessitous States,
but simply that we shall have our taxation—which is
mostly direct at present—obtained indirectly through
the Customs.
Now, apart from the fact—which Thomas must
surely know if he knows enough to tell a dog
from a mangle—that there is not a single word
in the Constitution committing the Federal
Government to indirect taxation, or any form
of taxation in particular, that gentleman is
telling a huge fish-yarn about the finances of
his own province. In 1898 N.S.W.’s indirect
taxation was £1,670,000, and its direct ditto
about £900,000 (more than one-third of it from
stamps). And it would have been less than
£BOO,OOO only the best part of two years’
land-tax was collected in one year. N.S.
Wales’s taxation never was “mostly direct,”
and when the Thomas crowd appeals for
votes against Federation on the ground that the
system of mostly-direct taxation will be des-
troyed it is eilher two asses or two frauds—
one of them because there is no such system ; to
destroy, and the other because there is nothing
in the Commonwealth Bill to destroy it. The
N.S.W. Labor-party went into Parliament,
partly to establish direct taxation in place of
indirect ; and Geo. Reid went into office to do
the same. They both failed so badly that, -in
1898, direct taxation in N.S. W. was less per
head^than in Maoriland, Tasmania, or S.A.
But they don’t like to talk about the failure.
The painful subject is dropped by mutual agree-
ment.

Hobart gives one Chinaman seven municipal
votes, and every landlord may vote in respect
of every cottage he owns. The occupier also
has a vote, but it is easy to see how tenant-
interests may be totally annulled by the land-
lord -interests at municipal elections. And
landlord rule has been eminently successful in
converting what is perhaps the most naturally-
healtliy city in Australasia into a city of un-
mitigated stink. That a place which professes
to cater for the tourist-trade doesn’t r'se up
and smother its civic authorities in the stnell-
fullest part of the far-smelled open sewer
known as the Hobart Rivulet, is a splendid
tribute to the presence of patience or the ab-
sence of nose in the Isle of Dreams. It was
stated in Parliament recently that, from Jan.
to July last, Hobart and suburbs produced 70
cases of typhoid fever, 220 cases of scarlet
fever, eight of diphtheria, and 14 of measles.
The hospital authorities say they can’t accom-
modate nearly all the scarlet-fever patients, and
Parliament has been moved to appoint a com-
mittee to consider the establishment of a hos-
pital, even temporarily, for infectious diseases ;
though Premier Braddon, with an eye on the
Treasury cash-box, opposed the notion with all
his hands and feet. He likewise pathetically
deprecated the “ growing tendency to proclaim
and exaggerate the unhealthiness of the city” !
But as Dr. Crowther, the only medical mem-
ber of Tas. Assembly, bluffly asserted that
there had been at one time 124 cases of typhoid
in Hobart Hospital, properly a 100-bed institu-
tion, the Premier backed down. If the com-
mittee doesn’t fall fast asleep until Xmas, there
is an outside chance of something being re-
commended in the way of an infectious dis-
eases hospital before the tourist season after
next.
Cardinal Moran states his ideas on the official-
precedence question :
That is a matter which was settled finally by Lord
Jersey. I never went to Govt. House functions until his
time, and, when he asked the reason, I said I would pro if
given ray proper position as a Prince of the Roman
Catholic Church. Personally, of course, it matters little
to me what position I occupy at a dinner-table ; but I
could not really go until the dignity of the position had
been placed beyond doubt. Lord Jersey communicated
with Downing-street, and now a Cardinal takes precedence
in all colonies where there is no Established Church. It
is not the question of the difference between dates of ap-
pointment so far as the Archbishop is concerned, for, as I
said before, it has been established in all countries where
there is no Established Church that a Cardinal is senior
to an Archbishop. There is no other rank equal to that
of Cardinal in N.S.VV., and that fact is recognised at
Govt. House, as everywhere else. To give an Archbishop
precedence over a Cardinal would be very much like
placing the captain of an army over a general. Of course,
you must understand I am speaking of places where there
is no Established Church. There is the crux of the whole
matter.
This attitude won’t greatly tend to popularise
the Cardinal. He may call himself a Prince if
he likes, but so far as the Australian States are
concerned he is only a Prince of the R.C.
Church in the same way as Primate Smith is a
Prince of the Anglican Church, and the Wes-
leyan boss is a Prince of the Wesleyan Church,
and the Dipper boss, whoever he may be, is a
Prince of the Baptist Church. What is the
matter with Cardinal Moran is that,
though a good organiser and a tjger to
work, he is utterly destitute of the social
savee, personal charm and high-bred court-
liness which distinguished his predecessors,
Archbishops Folding and Vaughan, and
which gained what amounted to precedence for
them wherever they went. In this respect he
might with advantage sit at the feet of the deft
and polished Archbishop Carr, who never un-
necessarily raises ugly questions and who,
when be does get into controversy, comports
himself like a swordsman and not like the mere
wielder of a bit av a shtick.

Now is the time for someone to give President
Kruger a copy of Francis Adams’s “ Songs of
the Army of the Night,” with the invocation to
the noble British soldier—
I stand and watch and wonder
When in the English land
This poor fool, Tommy Atkins,
Will learn and understand.
Zulus, and Boers, and Arabs
All fighting to be free,
Men and women and children
Murdered and maimed has he.
And the address to England :
We hate you—not because of cruel deeds
Staining a glorious effort. They who live
Learn in this earth to give and to forgive,
Where heart and soul are noble and fate’s needs
Imperious : No, nor yet that cruel seeds
Of power and wrong you’ve sown alternative,
We hate you, we your sons that yet believe
That truth and justice are not empty creeds 1
No, but because of greed and golden pay,
Wages of sin and death ; because you smother
Your conscience, making cursed ail the day.
Bible in one hand, bludgeon in the other,
Cain-like you come upon and slay your brother,
And, kneeling down, thank God for it, and pray !
Those lines are as true to-day as when written;
and doubters-are referred to the late R. Wal-
lace s article on “ The Seamy Side of Imperial-
ism ” in last Contemporary Review.
Henry Copeland’s proposed addition to
the Standing Orders of N.S.W. Parliament, to
the effect that any member’s Bill endorsed by ten
members of Assembly shall, without motion or
debate, be printed and circulated among mem-
bers, will simply build higher the already un-
necessarily big stack of profitless printing. ' Any
member can get ten members to endorse anv Bill

Frank Harvey’s awkwardly-named drama,
“ Shall we Forgive Her ? ” on which The Bulletin
cast a rather favorable eye at Sydney Royal a
year or two ago, is revived this week at the
Lyceum. Serious consideration, interspersed with
drinks, leads this organ to an even more favorable
opinion than it formed in those bygone days.
Plarvey’s drama is a strong, well-constructed play
with Soul in it, ansi is miles above the ordinary
seedy ruck of rneloscream. It is the tale of a
woman with a Past (there is only one kind of
Past that a woman can have). She used to have
it in South Africa, but for unknown reasons it is
now shifted to a dry, glarv part of Queensland.
There she and the digger who should have married
her, but didn’t, live in a hut in the Dry Country,
and the digger and six other devils like unto
himself look for gold in a gully. The, stuff pans
out twenty curses to the ton, and no inure. The
woman casts off her seven dreadful diggers
in course of time, and returns to Eng-
land, where she marries happily and hopes
to hear no more of these days in the Dry
Country which isn’t going to federate with
N.S.W. because of something or other about its
Great Natural Resources. But after a year of
happiness and peace the Past puts its griniy hand
in at the door and demands money as the price of
its silence. Also the Past looks with the blood-
shot eye of beer through the window and wants
drink; and the broken boots of the Past step
softly on the carpet and refuse to go away ; and
the Past puts its greasy, battered hat on the table
and casts the shadow of its rancid head across the
poor woman’s happiness. It is a dreadfully coarse,
unshaven Past, and when at last the husband
learns that his dainty wife had been a Magdalene
along with this pernicious object in the Dry
Country, he fires her out, and settles down to
blindness and Roman fortitude. In the end
he forgives the lady, and just here the drama
has been greatly improved. At the Royal two
years ago he forgave her publicly in the garden
while she knelt on the damp grass ; and the
baker’s man passing with the loaf, and the
butcher’s boy carrying the suet to Mrs. Smith, and
the policeman, and the nursemaid, and the agri-
culturist going for a pot of beer, were all at
liberty to see the function over the fence. It was
a very public place to forgive anybody in. Hol-
loway has now thought better of it, and the lady
is forgiven indoors.

The most notable person in this really fine
drama is a mere side-issue—one Joanna, a poor
Christian relative of the worst description, who
listens at keyholes, and carries information and a
prayer-book, and can’t sleep for fear that she
hasn’t been as horrid as the Lord intended her to
be to the girl with the Past. Miss Watts-Phillips’s
Joanna, like everything else that Miss Watts-
Phillips does, is good, but a lady gifted by nature
with a more sour disposition might have put an
even finer edge on Joanna’s awfulness. John
Saunders gives a very fine rendering of the
hero-in fact, it would be difficult for the part
to be done, better; and Miss Dora Winton,
in the mournful streaks of her part, is about
as good as possible- But in the cheerful streaks
she is a comparative failure, her cheerfulness
being of the subdued and tearful order. Still she
does one thing which deserves great praise:
instead of repenting in the conventional longdark
cloak and hood, over a brown dress with no
collar, she covers her broken heart with a well-
fitting greenish dress of costly material, and the
head bowed down has a large, expensive hat on
top of it. Miss Alice Deorwyn also makes a
success as the kind but combustible old lady who
takes the part of the oppressed and is with diffi-
culty restrained from slapping J oaitna, and some
other people do their duty more or less well.
Also, two of them do it badly.

The “King’s Musketeer” will run till
end of next week at Her Majesty’s, and it is to be
succeeded on Saturday (26th August) by “ Secret
Service” —a drama which has struck Europe and
America with great force. The “ Musketeer ”
should be quite good enough to last until the new
drama arrives, and gets its things off, and is ready
to perform. Porthos alone should be sufficient to
keep it going till then, to say nothing of the
general gorgeousness of the large-booted muske-
teers, and the beauty of the Queen and Miladi, and
the winsomeness of Miss Rose Musgrove as
D ’Artagnan’s sweetheart. By the way—why is it
that in both the versions of “ Three Musketeers ,r
lately produced in Sydney the authors have been
at such pains to bqwdlerise D’Artagnan’s sweet-
heart ? In the original, she was Constance, the
fair young wife of shopkeeper Bonacieux. And
shopkeeper Bonacieux was fat, and squat, and
white, and flabby, and mean, and flat-footed, and
common, and given to sneaking round corners. He
didn’t mind his wife being D’Artagnan’s Magda-
lene ; he merely looked with a pale, fat eye on
the seducer, and tried to raise sixpence or so on
the information ; and in the end he was righteously
dumped into the Bastille for life on a charge of
being a shapeless blot on the landscape and an
object that Richelieu didn’t like to see in the
street. One version of the “ Musketeers ” white-
washes Constance by making her shopkeeper
Bonacieux’s niece. The other drops shopkeeper
B. altogether. Why it should be necessary to
make such a sacrifice to Respectability in a city
where 22 per cent, of the births are Not Respect-
able it is hard to say, but the imperative necessity
for whitewashing Constance appears to have
struck everybody concerned. And Constance is
whitewashed accordingly, and transformed into
an awfully nice girl who would refleot credit on
any Sunday-school.

The “ Brixton Burglary,” which is mostly
the mystery of Diggle and Pontifex’s lost
clothes, has been contributing a good deal to
the gaiety of nations at Sydney Royal all the
week. One restful characteristic about it is that
nobody comes away feeling any call to be less
sinful than he was before. There are so many
plays which call on a man to repent of something
that one which doesn’t invite him to repent of
anything is welcome now and then. If there is
any moral about the “ Burglary,” it is that the
man who is eminently virtuous loses a great deal
of fun. No doubt Pontifex, as a married man,
shouldn’t have gone out with Higgle to have a
riotous time with the Bounding Sisters—especially
the married Bounder whose husband was away.
Is or should he have lied about it afterwards to his
mother-in-law—or if he did lie he should have
lied better. He ought to have spent a sober
evening at home with a brown-covered book,
and gone to bed at ten. Also, it was obviously
wrong in servant-girl Perkins to go out on a
stolen bicycle; the reprehensibleness of James, in
going to an orgy in his master’s suit, calls for
deafening condemnation; and the person who
stole Diggle’s clothes was the kind of person who
is a curse to any well-regulated community. And
yet a play in which all these people did the right
thing, and went to bed at ten, and met their
mother-in-law with a clear conscience next day,
would he as dull as a bucket of mud in four acts,
and if Brough insisted on keeping it on he would
go bankrupt. In a perfect world there will be no
comedy, for the public will demand its money back
when it hears that Pontifex has been out all night
with Diggle in the house of a strange woman, and
that James can’t tell the square and honest truth
about the clothes. Which accounts for the deadly
dullness of people like Brunker, M.L.A. Brunker
would die of grief if any one proposed that he
should go on the tear with Diggle.

That pretty comedy, “The Adventure of
Ursula,’ 1 is to be revived at the Royal on Satur-
day.
* * * He
At. Sydney Tivoli there is a “New Aus-
tralian Anthem,” composed by Paul Pelham,
musieked by Harry Ingham, and sung by Howard
Chambers. _ It is the weary kind of twopenny
anthem which says “ Hail ” very often, and when
the vein of inspiration runs low it “ Hails ” some
more. Bar Cinquevalli, the gem of the show is
Lottie Moore’s whirly dance, and her song of how
the parson is in the cemet’ry, the coons are in the
corn, the mocking-bird is sleeping, the rabbits
ain’t a-peeping, an’ we won’t go home till morn.
Monday night’s audience expressed its approval
of Lottie by passing up two sugar-melons tied
up with red ribbons, one pie melon without
ribbons, nine bouquets, two huge baskets of
native flowers, and a toy-train marked in large
letters, “The George-street Train.” The giddy
Valdares whirl and flee and do fresh tricks on
their bicycles, and Cinquevalli does all the
curious things he has done before, and some
new ones.

The “Kelly Gang’’ boom goes on the
awfulness of its way at Sydney Criterion, and
booms in the presence of audiences whose size is
unaccountable. How this crude, illiterate mass
of blood aud hardware should have run more than
two nights passes imagination. The management
has lately issued a solemn warning to other
managers not to use the play without permission,
and Williamson hasn’t looked at all well since.
Also Brough is trying to wear the outward sem-
blance of a man who didn’t want to borrow the
“.Kelly Gang” anyhow, and Holloway conceals
his disappointment as well as he can. Likewise,
an injunction has been applied for by the Criterion
man against another man who is accused of want-
ing to do an unauthorised “ Kelly Gang ” at New-
castle. Perhaps the law will see its way to in-
junct both of them.

“ The War of Wealth ” is waged as usual
at Melbourne Royal, and the rush on the Antipo-
dean Bank promises to last till the end of Bland
Holt’s long season. One incident in that sordid
sprint for boodle testifies to the exceeding goodness
of Mrs. Bland Holt. A strawberry blonde widow in
weeds of woe notifies the exhausted bank that she
will have to go home and starve if she can’t cash
her little cheque, whereupon Mrs. Holt passes
£2OO across the counter and commands the cashier
to pay the pleading relict aforesaid. Widows and
orphans had better make a note of this incident
with a view to making a pathetic picture
at the bank counter in some future hour
of need, when Sydney confidence is shaken
and hairy pastoralists are clamoring for their oof.
Also, The Bulletin would advise elderly capital-
ists of amorous character to keep a sharp look out
for the next crisis that they may be ready to earn
the coy gratitude of weeded young females by
saving them from liquidation or reconstruction in
the event of the till running dry. It doesn’t
follow that the Lord loveth the cheerful giver in
such cases, but the widow is pretty sure to catch
on, anyway.

The Farley trio, who make music under
abnormal conditions, old friends Howard and St.
Clair, and clever little Fanny Powers, are latest
additions to the bill at the Bijou, which is a long,
strong bill with no bald spots on it. The Keziahs
and the rolling contortionist are going away this
week, if they haven’t already departed; but the
stranger who stands upside-down upon a ’cello to
play the violin, comes to much the same thing as
the acrobatic sisters on the shiny ladder.
** * *
M‘Adoo’s Georgia Minstrels are getting
along tunefully at St. George’s Hall, and the
majesty of the tall basso is regarded with oon-
siderable awe. Also, the strange philosophy of
the cake-walk has some charms for the multitude,
and the colored comedian who remarks that the
gallery applauds with more vigor than the ground-
floor is undoubtedly correct in his observation.
** * *
Meanwhile Melbourne’s musical culture
progresses as it never progressed before. Scherek’s
Orchestral Concerts don’t quite fill the Town Hall
on Saturday afternoons, but they attract a re-
munerative crowd every time, and clever Herr
Benno has gone so far as to give them a symphony
of the lighter kind with gratifying results. Italian
Opera will begin to try its luck at the Alexandra
next Saturday week, and Marshall Hall’s series of
six Thursday Orchestrals at the Athemeum Hall
opens to-night (17th). This concert will be for the
benefit of Miss Elsie Hall, who will take charge of
the piano in a Beethoven concerto, and all
admirers of that gentle artist are expected to boom
the occasion.
All the unkindest things that Sydney said
about “A Stranger in New York” will probably
be echoed in Melbourne this week. Hoyt’s
anemic comedy trilled its occasional lay at the
Princess’s on Saturday night, and a broad-grin-
ning public who had mostly backed victorious
gee-gees at Caulfield, made desperate efforts to
enjoy the show. To say that Saturday’s audience
grew pensive towards the finish is to record the
dire failure of “ A Stranger in New York.” Bad
luck waits on bad judgment, as a rule, in every
line of business, and inasmuch as the Hoyt-M‘Kee
Co. includes but two clever comedians, and only
three other people worth mentioning, the present
scribe is not going to wet the management’s dis-
comfiture with his tears, anyway. There is no
visible reason why a foolish and comparatively
inexpensive production should expect any
better support from the masses than a grocer
gets from his unsatisfactory tea and currants.
Takes the ladies of the co. They have presentable
legs in a few instances, but regarded a.> singers,
dancers, or divinities in a country wl,. re good
voices are cheap and the resources of th Firm’s
ballet are practically unlimited, they amount to a
misguided speculation. Who was responsible for
this shipment of coke to Newcastle ?

The very best item in “A.5.1.N.Y.” is
Hugh Ward’s picture of an aged buck, who
quavers a characteristic ditty. Ward, as a gen-
tlemanly ruin with a senile fondness for deali
girls, is reminiscent of John Hare, the then young
“creator ” of Beau Farintosh and similar charac-
ters in the comedies that Tom Robertson wrote
for Mrs. Bancroft. Unfortunately Ward’s admir-
able old sinner gets no chance to shine after 8.30
p.m., or thereabouts. He subsides into a feeble
applauder of “ variety ” turns, and it is saddening
to see him pat his artistic hands together at the con-
clusion of a sick song which somebody has sung out
of tune. Most of the singing is out of tune,
but the Hoyt-M‘Kee Co. are a mutual admiration
society, and they encore one another religiously.
Conor gives one bright song with due effect, and
he is always brisk and funny in his grotesque,
pigeon-breasted style. The rest of the perform-
ance ranges from acceptable to fourth rate, also it
is frequently a mere repetition of the “Chinatown ”
performance. Moreover, it is loaded up with
comments on the roaring festive “time” that
everybody is supposed to be having at an invisible
French Ball, and what with the alleged fun that
never comes to pass, and the melancholy sugges-
tions of a “celebrated brilliant wit” and the
doleful spectacle of seven ladies imploring a bald-
headed man to tell them naughty stories, “ A
Stranger in New York ” seems almost too bad to
be true. You go away from the garish scene
under a vague impression that it was all a dream.

“ Aletes ” discourses to The Bulletin on
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” :
What an attraction “Tanqueray” seems to have had
for women ? Was in the gallery the last night of the
recent production. Found the place full to standing,
and the curious sex preponderating everywhere. Counted
carefully several rows to get an average, with result—9s
women, 48 men. What brought them ? Was it the pro-
blem, the intellect, or the emotion of the play? Let us
leave it to the man who thinks he understands the other
half.
It is a great play, who can gainsay it? What a terse,
yet restless, atmosphere pervades it 1 If there is any-
where in English letters, outside Shakespeare, a more
convincing tragedy, I would like to have it indicated.
For we have here the very essence of fine tragedy. The
gradual accumulation of deadly circumstance, its irre-
sistible progress and acceleration, its final relentless
triumph—the triumph of the past over the present, of
matter over mind. And the problem—what is it? Is it
more than a figment of the brain, a moral abstraction, a
bumping over mental ruts that thousands of years have
grooved? “ There is nothing either good or "bad,” says
Hamlet, “ but thinking makes it so.” So is it thinking
that gives this problem its palpable horror. Nature
builds a woman with a big heart and not too big a brain,
endows her with the vitality of three ordinary women, and
sets her in the world—the world does the rest. But Nature
could have saved that woman, notwithstanding. The
smile, the voice, the soft clinging arms of a child—what
a rampart round a woman's soul! But how wanton this
self-same Nature often is. Humanity cannot break her
laws with impunity. Yet occasionally she evades them
herself, and it is still humanity that suffers. Thelaiter
is for ever crudely striking the chords of life, and if the
keynote is missing, malevolently withheld, that would
have resolved them into harmony, jangling discords
alone ensue, and the problem iooins ahead. So whatever
there he in it of sin, or shame, or despair, there stands
with the world the other guilty partner of the deed—
Nature, Providence, God, name it how you will.
Evolution is but the s'tory of infinite" trials and errors
with a never-failing modicum of success. Time is for
ever wiping out the blunders ; the success is permanent.
This problem will probably go in its own good season ; it
belongs only to a passing phase of Life. But—and herein
lies the revenge of the Eternal—the higher complexity,
to which the human machine is ever attaining, will
develop a keener capacity for suffering, and Lhe oppor-
tunity will not be lacking. The pain of the world is for
ever shifting its nature and Its locale, but ft never leaves
us. This is the Problem of Life itself, before which we
are helpless. But this at least is clear, that our duty has
been, is, and ever will bo—to cultivate the divine flower
ol chanty lu our hearts.

Iwo letters concerning Amy Castles ap-
peared in last Saturday’s Age. One bore the
name of Atny s father, Joe Castles, and the writer
—who may have been the said Joseph, or some-
body else had the amusing “cheek” to begin
thus: “The gentlemen who acted as hon. com-
mittee of the late concerts will no doubt be grati-
fied to hear that my daughter has now the oppor-
tunity of cultivating her vocal talent.” After
which the alleged Joseph went on to return thanks
for the enthusiastic services of Rev. Father
Robinson, who has graciously consented to let
Amy give a farewell concert—one more last fare-
well—towards the choir funds of St. Francis’s
Church. The Other letter stated some good hard
facts re the Castles boom. “More than three
months ago,” wrote “Bendigonian,” “anumberof
subscriptions were received, and the public took
tickets for Miss Castles’ benefit concerts on the
understanding that they were assisting in a laud-
able object, which has long since been achieved.
A few weeks ago the excuse was given when her
advisers were first approached with a view of her
assisting Master Fritz Mueller in his concert, that
her voice would not stand the strain. What do
we find, however? Simply that she gives con-
certs in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and will
give, for aught one knows, more concerts in Syd-
ney and Melbourne. This, apparently, is about
the best possible way of ruining the young lady’s
voice. . . . Surely when funds are publicly ob-
tained for a specific purpose the contributors have
a right to demand that good faith be observed.
The promoters having asked for public sympathy
and invited gratuitous assistance from our musi-
cians, it is only a fair and reasonable request that
this mad money-making policy be immediately
dropped.” But why call it a mad policy ? The
Castles boom has been a perfectly sane transaction
from the start, and further evidences of its sanity
may be expected to crop up at any moment.
At Poverty Point.
Celia Datnpier, the bouneinsr, short-frocked, 15 or 16
year-old violinist (from Maorilaml), who sailed for
Europe t’other day, is possibly going to make a big
name hereafter. Celia, for all that her present skill and
intelligence can suggest to the contrary, may even
develope into the finest lady violinist on earth. Her per-
formances in Melbourne made a number of older young
aspirants look very amateurish ; yet it is too early to say
whether she can ever be more than a brilliant mechanist.
There is little feeling expressed in her music thus far.
“Jack Shay”: Went to see the Cake-Walkers, the
other night, and heard one pushite comment to another :
“ Wot guys ! Like bloomin’ goals ! Fancy blokes making
such a show of 'emselves 1 ” The thing gave me an idea :
Fancy a manager taking to Kurope and America a troupe
of “push” blokes in velvet-faced, big-buttoned, bob-
tailed coats, bell-bottomed pants, red-morocco-trimmed
boots and plug hats, with a corresponding allowance of
“ tarts.” They might do a set of push “ lancers ” and a
“ cat’s ” waltzing match up and down a 12-inch plank -
the dancers perfectly rigid with humped backs and grasp-
ing eac h othercollar-aud-elbow style. It ought to “fetch”
the English costers.
“C.C." : To the average woman Mrs. Tanqueray is
simply a lost sheep who had a lovely opportunity given
her of re-entering the sheep-fold of respectability, and
threw it away for want of a little horse-sense; to the
average man she is a glorious figure of the Fallen Woman
who made a tremendous effort to be good, and died be-
cause the Fates were too strong for her. “ Man is fine,
woman superfine,” as the old nursery-game has it, yet
how is it that quite a number of “nice” women think
Paula a fool for giving the Captain away, while the
average Bad Man shudders at the idea of her doing any-
thing else ? Similarly, when the Myra Kemble co. played
“ Dr. Bill ” in Dunedin with a wealth of innuendo foreign
to its revival here, it was the men who declared it unfit
for the Frenchiest of French stages, while the women all
said it was just awfully nice. Is it that women’s instincts
are really less refined than supposed ? Did it require that
Paula should lead the man’s life to acquire the man’s in-
stinctive sense of what is impossible? What would Mrs.
Oortelyon have done in her place? Let things slide?
A gushing musical crank gets these few remarks off his
weskit : —“The people of Bendigo, where Amy Castles
comes from, got a sudden and delightful shock when the
wonderful Flora Batson, after warbling a jet-like soprano,
threw her head back and trolled out in a light baritone
‘My Old Kentucky Home, Good-night.’ Miss Batson did
the same thing at the Sydney Palace the last night she
sang there. It was something to be remembered. The
auditorium was draped in shadow ; a single shaft of
limelight streamed down on tin Led panel and silken
curtain ; and then Flora glided into the light, looked up
with a winsome smile, and sent her soaring soprano right-
up among the Arabian arches. She was answered from
the darkness of a box by Gerard Millar, and her beautiful
voice rang on like a bell ahove the boom of the surf.
When she ceased, and the storm of applause had subsided,
she floated into the light again. It turned crimson ; the
gold circlpt round her neck gleamed like a ring of ruby
flame ; and she stood in the crimson light and sang in
baritone the same beautiful melody” (the enthusiast
is here turned off abruptly at the meter).
In “The IMly Gang,” at Sydney Cri., the Jerilderie
bank-manager is pourtrayed as a parsonieal person in a
frock coat, and he thus soliloquises: “ I wish I had got
that gold-dust, away out of the place. I’ve bought over
£5OOO worth this month." Going to Sheol for ice is not
in it with going to Jerilderie for gold-dust. If he said
that he’d bought £5OOO worth of wool and was keeping it
in the office-safe, and he hoped the Kellvs wouldn’t come
along with a portmtnteau and embezzle the lot before
next wool-escort left, it would put in a bit of convincing
local color, which would even appeal to the cockney Aus-
tralians of Sydney.
Adelaide Bowring, who, with her husband J. B. Steele,
came out to Australia in '66 under engagement to George
Coppin to support G. V. Brooke, lately died in England.
Steele and wife reached Melh. in the ship Western
Ocean, sailing some time before the ill-fated London,
in which Brooke was voyaging. They only heard of the
loss of the London and Brooke when the pilot boarded the
Western Ocean near Cape Otway. To guard against loss,
George Coppin insured the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Steele.
It is not known if he took the same precaution with
Brooke.

The Wilfley concentrator has only been a short
time before the mining public, but has already demon-
strated its superiority, over 1200 being sold within the
past two years. This machine has a capacity of from
25 to 30 tons per day, and will save more sulphuretts,
float gold, amalgam or quicksilver, and make a cleaner
and better separation than any belt concentrator made.
It can he easily and rapidly adjusted while in motion, and
requires no expert attention. The Austral Otis Engineer-

turing agents, and are now engaged constructing machines
for the colonies. The price of the machine is £115.

At an Associated G.M. shareholders’meeting in
London, to empower the directors to deal with 50,000
unissued shares, the chairman said they had already spent
about £100,000 in machinery, and it would take another
£30,000 to complete the new sulphide plant, which, in
full working order, would treat 400 tons sulphide per day.
The mills to treat oxidised ores would ileal with about
140 tons daily. It was intended, if possible, to maintain
an average value in each case. That of sulphide had not
been determined yet—it would probably be 2oz. The
average value of the oxidised ore—loz.—would be main-
tained. The anticipated production was exclusive of
tellnride ores sent to various smelting-works. These
would bring the total output up to 38,000oz. per month,
which, at £4 per oz., would make a monthly return of
about £159,000. A dazzling prediction, indeed. Over

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Premier Turner reports that the Victorian
revenue for the year ending June, 1899, after all adjust-
ments were made, amounted to £7,378,842. Expenditure,
so far as is known, £7,027,415, though there are still
possibilities that it may prove to he from £lO,OOO to
£20,000 less when all the accounts are in. Surplus
£351,427, with the possibility that it may ultimately get
up to 1370,000. Victoria has the largest increase of
revenue in Australasia this year, and the largest surplus.
Out of the latter £lOO,OOO is to be set aside for public
works ; £50,000 towards a sinking fund to provide for the
redemption of a £250,000 loan which falls due in 1903 ;
and £200,000 in reduction of the Great Deficit—which will
bring it down to £2,316,196. Considering that the de-
ficit got as high as £3,178,709, three or four years
ago, this is a big reduction. Victoria at one time
was supposed to have the biggest accumulated shortage
in Australia, hut N.S. Wales (which had a shortage at
30th June, 1898, of £3,098,590, since reduced probably to
about £2,948,590) now makes the worst showing in this
depressing respect. But Turner, after tolling through
much adversity, implores Victoria in general not to go on
the tear at the first sign of prosperity and not to assume
too much. His revenue was unexpectedly large last
year, partly because many rich men pegged out, and he
sadly remarks that these rich men can’t die over again
this year. Besides, the demand for reduced railway
freights and for a small reduction of the income-tax has
become almost irresistible. The maximum income-tax is
to be cut down from Is. 4d. in the £ lo Is. 2d. and a similar
reduction of one-eighth made all round, and freights on
agricultural produce are to be reduced by £55,009. So
Turner estimates next year’s revenue at £7,156,225 —
£222,617 less than that of the year just ended ; and ex-
penditure at £109,340 increase ; and assumes the surplus
at 30th June, 1899, to be only £19,470.

Apropos of the mystery of the Special Assets
Trust Co. (Limited) —that branch of the Commercial
Bank of Australia in which all the worst assets were put
some time ago— The Bulletin accidentally comes across
a copy of the “Statement of Assets and Liabilities on
30th June, 1899.” It sets forth that the liabilities to
depositors are 63,443,909, and other liabilities £lO0 —
total, £3,444,009. Also that the assets (of which only
£14,080 are cash) are worth on paper £4,261,441, leaving
asurplus of £817,432. But there is no income and ex-
penditure account, and no hint or suggestion as to
whether the £4,261,441 of assets and alleged assets earn
enough to pay interest on the nearly 3) millions of
deposits; whether the shortage, if there is one, is covered
by the £30,000 per half-year which the Commercial
Bank has lately heen paying to the Trust; whether
the shortage is so large that it is swallowing up,
or not swallowing up, all the profits of the visible part of
the Commercial Bank that remain after paying the
preference div. ; and, consequently, whether the com-
bined institution (the Commercial Bank of Australia and
the Assets Trust Co. are really one, to all intents and pur-
poses, because the bank shareholders are liable for every
penny of the Trust’s shortage, if there is one, just as
much as if it was the hank’s own shortage) is prospering
greatly or going downhill, in a dangerous fashion. It
doesn’t matter much that the assets of the Trust are
worth, on paper, £817,432 more than its liabilities, if these
assets don’t earn enough to pay interest on the liabilities;
if there is a large and reliable shortage in the income,
then things are bad, despite the paper surplus. Audit
wouldn't matter much though the assets on paper were
not equal to the liabilities if these assets regularly earned
more in cash than the outgoings; the surplus in-
come and the" sum which the Commercial Bank hands
over half-yearly would.inake good the deficit in time.
At the Commercial Bank’s annual meeting the
Chairman referred to the demands—which have been
mostly The Bulletin’s demands—for information about the
Assets Trust, and said that “ he, for one, would not take
the responsibility of valuing these assets.” Well, he and
his fellow-directors of the Trust have taken it, in a fashion ;
they put down these assets in the Trust’s statement at
£4,261,441. But, as it happens, this paper for one didn’t
ask him to “value these assets,” and Chairman Harper’s
indignant assertion that he couldn’t do what wasn't asked
is quite irrelevant. The board has further stated on
various occasions that it can’t accept responsibility for its
predecessors’ more or less unlucky investments which are
now buried in the Trust—but no one asked or expected
that it should. There was merely an inquiry, on
behalf of the shareholders and public, as to whether
these unlucky investments were paying their way.
The chairman also remarked that “ certain kinds of
partial information would not be beneficial to the share-
holders,” wherefore one naturally asks : Why does he
insist on giving only partial information ? He also denied
flatly that the statement of the Assets Trust was kept
secret, but as the statement gives no information about
the income, expenditure, loss or profit, it might as well
be kept secret. Also, he remarked effusively that for
two years back the bank had made £105,000 a year over
and above all expenses. Which is quite true ; that part
of the Commercial Bank which is called “ the bank ” did
do so, as far as is known. But dividends on preference
shares have absorbed £40,000, and if there is a deficit
in the Assets Trust’s income which has more than
eaten up the remainder the bank shareholders might like
to know of it. The Trust Co. belongs to them, and the
defieit, if there is one, is their deficit. The question is
simply this : Have the Commercial Bank shareholders a
right to know what their net profit is, or have they not?
And if not, why haven’t they ?
* * » *
There is nothing in particular to be said about
the report of the old Victoria Life and General Insurance
Co. This co. does no new business now, and just waits
patiently for the last insured and the last annuitant to
die out. During the year to 30th June, 1899, £10,457 was
paid in claims, so the insureds are dropping off reasonably
fast. The co. pays a dividend of 15 per cent. (£6000), as
compared with 12) per cent. (£5000) last year, and the
accumulated funds are diminished from £318,381 a year
ago to £314,320. Considering that the Victoria Life" Co.
does no new business—and new business is the kind that
costs money—the expenses seem very high. They run to
fully 33 per cent, of premiums, or over 10 per cent, of total
income. The Victoria Life Co. has nothing to do now but
keep an eye on its pile and die respectably, and this
seems a rather expensive death.. Also, seeing , .hat
£356,000 worth of actual investments yield only £10,447,
or £2 18s. Bd. percent, per annum all round, the expen-
sive eye which is kept on the funds might produce better
results. The fixed deposits, Maori land State Debentures,
Victorian Government Stock, Melbourne Board of Works
Debentures, and loans on policies, must surely average 3)
percent. And jf they do, then thp inference is that the
£159,9.85 of “mortgages and other securities” and
£24,635 of “ properties ” only yield about 2) per cent.
Are the mortgages uot feeling well just now ?
* * * *
The Victoria Insurance Co. issues, for the year
ended 30th June, 1899, the first respectable and decent
and perfectly sane balance-sheet it has published for a
long while. The following statement of the doings of this
once great but (of late years) woefully mismanaged co.
will explain the writer’s meaning ;
Profit. Dividend.
June, 1893 .. £34,054 44f per cent. = £22,468
„ 1894 .. 24,400 „ „ = 22,468

Profits .. .. £105,554 Dividends .. .. £105,599
During the period 1893 to 1897 it was well known that the
assets of the Victoria Insurance Co. had depreciated
greatly. The situation became so bad that a footnote
began to appear in the co.’s balance-sheets to the effect
that the assets were, taken at book value—which was
practically the same as saying that their values were
partly bogus. Yet the co. continued to pay away practi-
cally all its profits (in 1806 it actually paid away more
than its profits) in stupendous 35) and 40.) and 44) per
cent, dividends, and made no serious attempt at provid-
ing for depreciation out of current earnings. In 1897,
while paying a 35) per cent, dividend, it broke in on its
reserve fund to partially provide for the depreciation.
In 1898 the great slump had to he faced at last. The
whole contingency fund of £25,000 : the accumulated
profit balance of £10,174 and £8162 of the re-insurance
fund were written off at one swoop. Depreciation to the
amount of £20,000, which had been kept dark while the
40 per cent., dividends were being paid, was admitted and
the reserves went down all at once from £BO,OOO to about
£36,000.
The improvement this year lies in the fact that
the Victoria Insurance Co. has at last cut down its divi-
dend to about 9 per cent., and carries forward a balance
of £10,103. If it keeps its dividends down to 9 per cent,
for the next seven or eight years, and no unusual disaster
strikes it, it will be a big', strong concern again ; if it gets
back to the 44) per cent, insanity, it won’t. Everything
depends on whether the management is clothed and in its
right commercial intellect again. It would have been a
still better sign if £10,001) of the balance had been
put at once to reserve lest the management should
feel like blewing it next year. The Victoria is a
very small affair compared with what it used to be ; as
an evidence, the year’s income from investments is £2445,
whereas it was £5376 in 1894, which shows a grievous
melting away of the assets. The Australian Mutur.], of
Sydney—which was a poor, paltry concern in the old days
of the Victoria’s greatness, has now more than twice its re-
serves. Still the Victoria has a magnificent business (the
year’s premium income reached £127,798), and it may
easily be the strongest fire company in Australia again in
a few years if the management doesn’t fly off the handle
any more.

The Victoria General Insurance and Guarantee
Co. reports that its profit for the year ended 30th June,
1899, was £4511, and it pays a dividend of 15 per cent.,
which absorbs £3OOO. Some recent doings of the
Victoria General are as follows :
Profits. Dividends.
June, 1593 .. £6283 15 per cent. = £3OOO
„ 1894 ... 6477 20 „ = 4000
„ 1895 ... 5629 20 „ 4000

Profit.
„ 1899 ... 4511 15 „ ■ 3000
Profits £26,565 Dividends ... £25,000
During three years out of the last seven this co. paid
away more than its earnings—once in the frantic effort
to pay a 25 per cent, dividend ; once in order to pay
20 per cent.; and the third time it paid 10
percent., and thereby went over £7OOO to the bad in a
single year. Apparently the frenzy after risky and sensa-
tional dividends is common to both the Victoria com-
panies, which is probably accounted for by the fact that
they are under the same management. The Victoria
General Co. also admits (just as the Victoria used to do)
that its assets are not quite what they seem ; the second
largest of them is “Loans on Mortgage at Book Value
(depreciation allowed for in Contingency Account)
£11,630.” This seems to suggest that the contingency
account of £4OOO is already partly or wholly swallowed up
by losses, and is therefore either partly or wholly a mere
paper reserve. It also suggests that, though the Victoria
General professes to have earned in the last seven years
£1565 more than it has spent, it has really been going to
the bad, when depreciation of assets is allowed for. The
Victoria General has £20,000 paid-up capital, a miserably
humble reserve-fund of £5OOO, and £3005 profit balance
(total reserves, £8005), together with whatever is left, if
anything is left, of its contingency fund. At June,
1893, it had £5OOO reserve and 18722 profit balance (total
£13,722). Its premium income this year is £11,692 ;in
1893 it was £12,702. This year its income from invest-
ments is £913 ;in 1893 it was £1854. Its profits are
£l7OO less than they were in 1892. So, altogether, The
Bulletin feels justified in calling it a small, weak, and
recklessly-managed institution, which is gradually fooling
away a very fine opportunity.
* * • •
The very remarkable Montgomerie’s Brewery
Co., (Melbourne) has decided to end its heart-breaking
career in liquidation. Considering some of its recent
doings that is, probably, the only way out. A few past
records of the co. have heen as follows :
1892 Profit... ~£7679 1896 Loss ... ..£4147
1893 „ .. .. 3461 1897 „ .. .. 6041
1894 ~ .. .. 1160 1898 „ .. .. 4194
1895 Loss .. .. 1611
The loss for the first half of ’99 is said to have been only
£l6OO, so things were really coming round—only they
came round too late. The co. was an inflated affair from
the first. It paid £25,001) for the goodwill of the awful
business, and when the bad days began it was paying in-
terest on an overdraft of £78,U00 incurred in spreading
the business out too far, and securing hotels, many of
which were only a millstone round the neck of the luck-
less concern. It would have been a paying concern all
along but for the spreading out and the overdraft. The
visible losses are considerable, but the rotting away of
the assets is the worst trouble. The bank that holds that
overdraft will probably be sorry now.
* * * *
Swallow and Ariel, Limited, Alelbourne, reports,
in a subdued tone, for the year ended 29th April, 1899,
that things are not quite so had as they might be. Recent
profits have been :
Dividend.
1896 ... £10.200 ... Nil.
1897 ... 10,470 ... 2) per cent. = £3648
1898 ... 3,387 ... 1) „ = 1824
1899 ... 6,530 ... 2) „ = 3648
The dividends have been so much less than the earnings
that the profit balance has accumulated to £26,523. But
apparently it has only accumulated on paper and not in
visible cash, for the bank overdraft and mortgages, which
were £64,847 in 1896, have spread out to £68,5)6 in 1899.
In three years the co. has saved, on paper, over t'll,ooo
of its profits, and yet the overdraft and mortgages, in-
stead of improving, have become nearly £4OOO worse.
Under these conditions it might be wiser to suspend divi-
dends altogether until part, at least, of the big load is
shifted.

Norman Godkin, of 31 Queen-street, Alelbourne,
is prepared to purchase or develope, with option of
purchase, “big prospecting shows” (either gold or
mineral) in any part of Australia. Properties offered
must be suhject to inspection.*
B.H. South, which has paid £20,000 in divs.
during the six months, has made only £12,690, even
when credit is taken for £13,304, which is the amount
realised for surpluses in respect of former shipments
and sales. It began the Half year with £9391 cash
in hand ;it closed the term with £4B. The directors’ re-
port is painfully scanty ; the only reference to finance is
this : “ The sum of £3969 2s. Id. has been expended in
necessary development work, £20,000 paid in dividends,
and £3620 7s. lOcl. spent on plant and buildings.” Not a
word to show that only a part of the £20,000 was earned
and that the £3620 is not charged against the half-year’s
work—though it is fair to say that the South Co. always
makes a reasonable deduction for depreciation. Two
causes have heen at work making for poor results—neces-
sary alterations of,machinery and poorer and harder ore.
The latter was, however, by far the more important. This
and the preceding haL-year compare as follows :
Ore treated. Value.
ToDec.,’9S .. 42,845 tons .. £57,627
To June,’99 .. 43,150 tons .. £51,691
It is expected that recent alterations in plant will make
some difference ; but it is not likely to be much—as far as
can he seen, they will no more than counterbalance the
continued deterioration of the ore. Still, manager Green-
way expects to make some improvements not yet an-
nounced ; and the directors say :—“ The process of zinc
extraction may be said to have advanced beyond the ex-
perimental stage, and your directors will, it is expected, be
called on shortly to consider the erection of plant for
treating their accumulations of zinciferous material.”
With that rather cold comfort and the prospect of 6d.
divs. quarterly instead of shilling ones, shareholders
must be as content as shareholders reasonably can be in
such circs.
• • • •
B.H. South does not give its shareholders any
figures showing the assay values of ore ami concentrates
respectively ; and from the report no estimate can be
made of the quality of the concentrating work. But of a
recent week it is published that 1777 tons ore was mined,
worth 26'3 per cent, lead, 7'7oz. silver, ami 16 6 per cent,
zinc, and that the concentrates produced were 408 tons,
assaying 64'3 per cent, lead, 12 6 oz. silver, and 7'9 per
cent. zinc. The metal contents of the ore was thus 468
tons lead, 13,6320 z. silver, and 295 tons zinc. The concen-
trates contained 274 tons lead, 51410 z. silver, and 32 tons
zinc ; while the tailings, slimes, &c., contained 194 tons
lead, 8541 oz. silver, and 263 tons zinc. A small quantity
of slimes, &c.,is re-treated ; from these in this particular
week 68 tons was saved, assaying 48'2 per cent, lead,
9'3oz. silver, and 13'6 per cent, zinc—a product of very
little market value, owing to the high percentage of zinc.
Dismissing this product, therefore, and referring to con-
centrates proper, it is found that the process saves 274
tons lead and fails to save 194 tons, saves 51410 z. silver
and fails to save 85410 z., eliminates 263 tons zinc and fails
to eliminate 32 tons. Yet the South has been concen-
trating longer than any other B.H. mine, and it has the
advantage of having as its metallurgist one of the most
painstaking and experienced and energetic men on the
Barrier. The figures indicate what a makeshift concen-
trating is after all ; though it ought to be added that,
apparently, the South's ore is unusually hard and refrac-
tory.
• • • »
As to the cost of mining at Broken Hill. The
South has no surface open-cuts, mines sulphides exclu-
sively, and its ore is, on the whole, harder than that of any
other mine—so hard that it speedily grooves the toughest
steel rollers. Yet here is the cost per ton of mining
there, including breaking, trucking, hauling, timbering,
and management, along with the quantity broken, for the
half-years ending on the dates named :
Cost per ton. Quantity mined,
s. d. Tons.
June,’96 ... 16 7) ... 29,951
Dec., ’96 ... 14 3 ... 36,321
June,’97 ... 12 2 .. 41,887
Dec.,’97 ... 11 3 „. 40,197
June,'9B ... 11 6 ... 42,340
Dec., ’9B ... 12 34 ... 42,845
June,’99 ... 12 0J ... 43,150
Modifications in the system of mining are responsible for
some of the reductions (in some mines the cost used to be
about 305.); but the miners’ pay-sheet would explain a
good deal, too. Still, the South is by no means the
miners’ worst mine.
* * * *
Broken Hill co.’s now have 7800 employes, of
whom 5860 are on the mines, 1300 at Port Pirie works,
and others at smelters elsewhere—Port Adelaide and
Cockle Creek mostly. B.H. Prop, heads the list with
2900 hands; the Central (Sulphide Corporation) and
Block 14, about 1500 and 1050 respectively. The weekly
output of ore averages just under 26,000 tons, of which
B.H. Prop, contributes 8300 tons.
* * * *
Just when the Broken Hill mining co’s. and
open-cut contractors are advertising in every capital for
able-bodied men, the district Ms.P. beg help from the
Govt, for local unemployed. As a matter of fact, there
are not many unemployed, but they are persistent. Pro-
bably half of them are men who, for some past offence, or
supposed offence, are blacklisted at the mines ; the
others can’t stand the incessant racket of mine labor, and
there is no other local industry to mop them up. That
there is a black-list still is quite certain ; and the most
odious feature about it is that a man doesn’t know that
his name is on it until, after weary months of fruitless
searching for work from one mine to another, the truth
forces itself on him. Then if he is wise he clears ; the
White Cliffs opal-fields and the Westralian mines have
absorbed scores of them. And a fact worth noting is
that managers, leaving Broken Hill for other parts, have
there given some of these blacklisted men the first chance
of a job.

The Bulletin office often lias a lot of ore in
sight, and though the practice of sending it in has never
been encouraged, this paper receives too many requests
for gratuitous assays and opinions as to value and treat-
ment of samples submitted. Arrangements have now
been made for testing, by assay and otherwise, samples of
ore, provided the sum of £1 is sent with each to cover
cost. Assays alone do not serve the miner’s purpose,
lienee certificates supplied to Bulletin correspondents
will not only give a statement of metallic contents —
owners will be advised by an experienced, practical metal-
lurgist as to the best methods of treating the ore in bulk,
whether by wet or dry crushing and amalgamation, smelt-
ing, cyaniding, chlorinating, etc. Parcels should not be
less than lib. nor more than 101 b.
* • • *
The very cheekiest thing The Bulletin has
met with in the N.S.W. dredging racket up to date is the
prospectus of the Little River Gold Dredging Co. (Braid-
wood, N.S.W.). It is in 48,000 shares of 10s. each; and
16,000 of them, fully paid up, are to he allotted to the
vendor in payment for “the applications and interests
herinafterdescribed.” The vendor, apparently, when the
co. was floated, hadn’t an inch of dredging claim to Sell,
but he had applied for a great lot of land, and his chance
of getting the laud, or part of it, or none of it, is sold to
the co. for 16,000 paid-up shares. The co., apparently, is
even to pay the cost of the application, for among the
expenses it is to meet are “certain payments made.and
due to the Crown ” —amount not specified. The shares, it
is said, have been largely over-applied for, and if that is
so the vendor would prohably have no difficulty in selling
his 16,000 paid-up shares at once if he wanted to. If the
boom is as vigorous as it is alleged to be, the vendor, it
would seem, can get his money whether there is any lease
granted or not. And supposing he did sell them, and
then the leases applied for were refused—there is, appar-
ently, no possible evidence that they won’t be! Then the
vendor would have, perhaps, £BOOO, and the co. would be
out of a great deal of money, and the only dredging area it
would have to dredge in would be the area its advt. takes
up in the papers. The man who sells the lease of an
unproved dredging area to a co. for a large sum was bad
enough. The man who sells the fact that he is asking for
a lease is worse. The only thing wanting now is the pros-
pectus of the man who wants to sell to a co. the fact that
he is thinking about asking for a lease when he gets fully
rested. The Little River Co.’s prospectus, by the way,
enumerates certain agreements that have been made, anil
says “it is believed the above are the only contracts the
dates of and parties to which are required by sec. 48 of the
No-Liability Mining Co.’s Act of 1896 to be specified in this
prospectus ; but, in order to prevent any question, appli-
cants .for shores shall be deemed to waive any further
compliance with that enactment.” Which off-hand way
of abolishing the Act seems to make it just possible that
the shareholders may find themselves hampered by some
very surprising contracts of which they, at present, know
nothing. Anyhow, they agree, it would appear, not to
complain, whatever contracts may turn up.

Tmon River dredge (N.S.W.); More explana-
tions given for not cleaning-up. Public now told that it
would only represent a fortnight’s work or so, though the
dredges have been operating more than two months. No
excuse whatever given for the market-value of this pros-
pective venture (which “ is bound to see £20”), and no
reason mentioned for the very heavy market-fall of last
week. All the Sydney newspapers seem to be barracking
lustily for the show. There is a mystery somewhere, and

From Col>ar, the chief gold-copper camp of
N.S.W. ; Occidental, 2240 z. for a three weeks’run of 20
stamps—probably representing a shade over 4dwta. ;
cleaning up cyanide plant this week. Probable total gold
value £2OOO, of which fully half profit. Old tailings run-
ning about 2)dwts., more than half of which is profit;
still at least 30,000 tons to treat. With plenty wafer
this co. (which has just much increased its dain-cupacity)
could easily pay 2s. Od. a year in divs.
Great Western.—After one small attempt at
decent management this co. has gone back to its miser-
able ways—sunk a main shaft within 80ft. of the ore-
channel and then abandoned it to return into the old
shaft which is as crooked as a ram’s horn, and renew the
old system of gutting and dragging out the good streak
of ore by the hair of the head. The new little tinpot
cyanide plant is also in keeping with things generally.
Still another expert has been up. examined and no doubt
admired the working of all other local mines save the
G.W., which is most of the time under offer, but, alas I
never sold.
The Young Australia is getting into fair work-
ing shape. Has a good main shaft, and is equipped with
winding, batr.eiy, and cyanide plant. Important develop-,
nient made a few weeks ago, and that of last week estab-
lishes at least 12 months’ work on an ore-body which will
be taken for a width of over 20ft. Some phenomenal
assays have been mentioned, but even tin-owing these aside
the outlook for divs. is very bright.
Cobar Chesney: Main shaft being cut down to
bottom level, 560 ft. ; will take about five weeks to com-
plete. Levels run out connected with winzes, and every-
thing ready to maintain an output of 300 tons a day if
needed. All the plant on the ground, but it will be fully
three months ere it is running ; when complete, it will be
probably the most compact copper-concentrating plant in
Australia. Co. will have spent over £30,000 before it pro-
duces a ton of copper, but none of it seems to have been
wasted, and it is going to mine in a big way.
Cobar Gold Alines is now equipped with the
finest milling and cyanide plant in N.S.W.—in fact, there
is no other mine within streets of it. The cyanide plant
is the biggest in Australia ; it was designed by Butters,
one of the big Rand cyanide.men, and has costover
£lO,OOO ; over £2OOO was expended in the riveting of the
vats, All the other additions to the 100-head stamp mill
are in keeping—the electric-lighting plant, air-com-
pressor, winding-engine, rock-breakers, &.c. It is quite
easy to see where the £30,000 represented by these addi-
tions has gone. Another call of £lO,OOO just made, and
the local shareholders are responding to a man. The
mine is ready to supply 300 tons a day, and a start will
be marie at the beginning of Sept.; it will probably be
long ere another stoppage occurs. The battery is in the
wrong place, it is true, and but for this serious mistake
the whole outfit would be an object-lesson in mining
equipment.

SOCIETY
VERY OLD [?]
"D.C.L."
[?]
The unaccountable girl who makes pro-
miscuous charges against men is an every-day
occurrence ; the unaccountable man also turns up
occasionally. Miles, the Ashfield (N.S.W.) sig-
nalman, who planted an obstruction on the line
in front of the Melbourne express, and then
rushed to the station with a story about having
surprised an unknown man in a fiendish device to
wreck the train, is a very ordinary and harmless,
specimen of the tribe. He didn’t lay a plot,
against anybody in particular; by his own admis-
sion he built up his little scrap of fiction “ for
notoriety.” In his own small way he wanted to.
be some kind of a hero and get his name in the
papers. Most likely he felt he could be a decent
hero if he had the chance. He never got an oppor-
tunity to save any one from drowning, for people
don’t drown on the railway-line. He hadn’t the
luck to rush nobly out of a burning building
with his hair on fire and a saved girl under his
arm, and, not being at sea, he had no show to
strike a noble attitude on the sloppy deck as the
ship went down. When the yearning to excite
admiration comes over a rich man very badly, he
sends a large cheque to the hospital; but a poor
man who isn’t a cricketer, or a pug., and who can’t
write an open letter to John Norton, must either
wait patiently for his chance, or make it himself.
Miles (after 16 years of apparently faithful ser-
vice) made it in a small, foolish way by putting a
bit of iron on the rails and then rushing to save
the lives of the passengers on the express by giving
notice of the danger. He meant no harm, and did
no real injury ; all he wanted was to be a bene-
factor, and be recognised as such. If he had re-
sisted the temptation he n ight, in time, have so
completely got over the desire to be a benefactor
that he could have watched all his relatives drown-
ing without any excitement. But he gave way to it.
The Forrest Govt, is the only one in Aus-
tralia that has appointed a commission for Paris
Exhibition. Other less reckless Governments
wisely hold aloof, the frightfully extortionate
price demanded for floor-space proving an insuper-
able objection. Venn, M.L.A., a pompous indi-
vidual, married into one of the Six Families, is
president of the W.A. Commission. He formerly
occupied a seat in Forrest’s Ministry, but was
kicked out “m his nightshirt” for insubordina-
tion. He is intensely vain, but very wealthy, and
the astute Premier created the Commission for
him. Haekett, proprietor of the West Aus-
tralian, who is Forrest’s boss in all things, is a
member of the Commission, which also includes
little Illingworth and Morgans. Haekett attends
more functions than any other half-dozen men in
the country. He is member of parks and gardens,
museums, hospitals, public libraries, and water-
works boards, of select-committees galore, is great,
high deputy past panjandrum of all the Free-
masons, and rarely misses any dinner, reception,
concert or anything that happens to be going on.
How he manages it is a profound mystery. Some
say there are two Hacketts.
Coolgardie Exhibition has cost the Forrest
Govt, over <£17,000 to date. At a recent meeting
of the self-styled commissioners, they voted them-
selves gold medals, and as there are about 60 of
them, and the medals will cost (say) a fiver apiece,
the bill will be still further swelled. Exhibitors
who assisted the show by displays of valuable
machinery receive diplomas only. Begun in folly
it ended in shame —opened with champagne and
closed with “shypoo.”
• » * *
Victoria spends on charity £193,294 annu-
ally, of which the Govt, contributes <£92,470 (in-
cluding .£46,000 for reformatory schools). Of the
whole, no less than <£41,803, or nearly 22
per cent., goes in secretaries’ wages and collectors’
commissions. Women appear to be far the best
managers, the local ladies’ benevolent socie-
ties running their charities at an average cost of
2\ per cent. only. Govt, reformatories are run at
about 9Jj per cent. ; free dispensaries at 62 per
cent. ; and one awful institution —the Royal
Humane Society- expended «£66 15s. 6d. in chari-
ties, while the secretary’s salary mopped up £250
per annum. Many of these alleged charities are
simply intended to provide billets for those run-
ning them. About time the Govts, of all the
States took on their own shoulders the burdens
they have so long and so cheerfully dodged—the
providing for the sick and the poor and the orphan
and the widow.
* * * *
N.S.W. Colonial Secretary Brunker’s
effort to make sons and daughters support their
indigent parents promises to be a somewhat drastic
measure. If one member of a family supports an
indigent parent, provision will be made enabling
that member to sue his brothers and sisters for
proportional shares. But in all cases the law will
only be put in motion against children having a
superfluity after providing for the maintenance of
themselves and families. A son will not be
excused from payment by pleading that he has
offered to take his parents into his own house.
m m m m
N.S.W. Minister Hogue, instead of cast-
ing about for pretty phrases of his own make for
the suppression - of-juvenile-pauper Bill, over
which he says he is burning midnight oil, should
ask the assent of Parliament to the main clause of
the English Prevention of Cruelty to Children
Act of ’B9. This Act renders liable to arrest,
without a warrant, “any person who causes or
procures any child under 16 to be in any street for
the purpose of begging or receiving alms, or of
inducing the giving of alms, whether under the
pretence of singing, playing, performing, offering
anything for sale, or otherwise.” This would clear
the crowds of youngsters from Sydney streets —by
netting the parties who use them. If there be
■children there without motion from adults in
hiding they can be picked up under a section of
■existing N.S.W. law.

A curious specimen of the vag. species
lately turned up at Brunswick (Vic.) Police Court.
He was a wild, unkempt individual, and in
evidence it came out that not only did he abstain
from work but he insisted on sharing the meagre
allowance his aged mother received from the
Benevolent Society. Then some one got the
ancient lady admitted into a charitable institution
and the unfortunate son was thrown on his beam-
ends and duly dragged before the court. The
■court in indignation rose up and heaved 12 months
at him, and instead of falling down dead under the
weight of it this nonchalant vag. only remarked :
“Ah ! Twelve months ! Thanks. What’s to
become of my furniture ? ”

One Australian potentate who holds many
■distinguished offices, and pretends to fine manners,
■culture, and Chesterfieldian courtesy, is rather
thinly veneered. Any day of the week he may
be seen industriously manicuring his finger-nails
while counsel is addressing him. For this pur-
pose, indeed, he carries about with him a regular
set of mother-of-pearl-handled instruments, and
■one or other of these is always in use. Even
when in the chair at a very impressive recent full-
dress function he could not leave his nails alone.
He appeared in gorgeous millinery, and during
the principal address sat beside the Governor,
busily paring and filing his nails.

A. Dent, on
teeth
Compare the
teeth of various
children, and try
to account for the
difference. Arti-
ficial teeth for
Australian chil-
dren are becom-
ing quite com-
mon; and the tak-
ing of “babes”
to have their
teeth scraped,
regulated, filled,
etc., is now a
regular thing.
Writer knows
several instances
of children under
12 wearing arti-
ficial teeth. And
now someone
proposes that in-
cidentally to a
youngster’s
schooling its
teeth should be
“ regulated.”
(Nothing new,
this.) Some ob-
servations:
Father and
mother with good
teeth : children
from 5 to 15 have
had nearly all
their second
teeth extracted,
and are wearing
substitutes.
Again, parents
are both lacking
full number of
teeth, but pro-
geny, from 15 to
30, have all more
than usually
go od sets of natural teeth. Now, in the former casei
the home abounds with “patent” foods all guaran-
teed to form flesh and bone; whereas the second
family are, and h ave always been, meat eaters. The
first lot of children were suckled on “ bottle ” and
weaned on “ patent ” pa p, but the second lot were natur-
ally suckled and weane d on a mutton-bone or a strip of
beef. Country people, also, who are reared and live on
natural toothsome food, are stronger in chewing-tackle
than city people, who favor “ ready-cooked,” “ ready
digested,” “ready assimilated” “patents,” and whose
teeth, as a rule, either fail to form or fail to last. All
this favors the conclusion that the general failure of
teeth, is not so much from lack of stamina as from want
of use. [A good deal in this, though the induction isn’t
wide enough to be trustworthy. Many hold that
“science” has taken away more from hygiene with one
hand than she has given with the other. —Ed. B.]
Melb. Board of Health, having found
tubercular bacilli in samples of the milk supply,
set on the trail a vet. who traced the trouble to a
Templestowe cow with a heart weighing 3flb.
(chiefly tubercle) over the average. The animal
had such a fine exterior that Templestowe, when
the animal’s destruction was ordered, arose in its
wrath and protested. Moral: Never judge a cow
by her overcoat.

Pointed out by a Sydney meat-inspector
that a great many of the carcases he deals with
have had the neck-glands carefully removed, and
that, though in those cases he may be perfectly
certain that the animal had shown disease in that
part, he is—so long as no traces of the actual cor-
ruption are left—quite powerless to interfere !
Which shows it to be urgently necessary that
the fact of any portion of a carcase usually re-
tained having been excised should legally be made
prima facie evidence of disease.
OUR BOARDING-HOUSE AGAIN.
It was the Sabbath, and the conversation had naturally turned -upon grave and solemn
subjects, “ I have never,” said the mean man, as he helped himself to the last
banana on the fruit-dish, “ I have never been inside a church but once in ten
years.” “And how came you to go then?” asked the husband of the lady-
acrobat, as he picked his teeth with the nut-crackers. “I went," said the mean
man, finishing the banana in two bites, “ I went to get rid of thruppence with a
hole in it, which I had tried in vain to pass off for months!”
At a Federation meeting in Melbourne,
recently, Watt, M.P., quoted Brunton Stephens’
lines :
“ Till all our sundering lines with love o’ergrown
Our bounds shall he the girdling seas alone.”
And the Argus gave them thus :
“Till all our sundered lives with love o’ergrown,
Our bonds shall be the gurgling seas alone.”
“ Gurgling seas ! ” And the Argus has been so
indignant lately about the mishandling of loci]
poets. Many’s the poetry-book the Argus never-
read.

Dear Bulletin - .— After what you have
printed on the matter, pro and con, 1 think the
Gregory lunacy affair may safely be left to settle
itself. But I would like to say a word about the
one really scandalous feature of the matter—viz.,
the “nobbling” of the Melbourne press. Because
Mr. C. A. Topp is leader of the Vic. Bar, as well
as permanent head of the asylums department,
the law court reporters were seemingly anxious to
“ spare the feelings of Mrs. Gregory ” (she being
Mr. Topp’s sister) by preserving an all-round
silence re her husband’s appeal to Justice
Williams. Topp family influence shut the case
out of the papers, and thereby excited suspicion.
The correspondence in The Bulletin, whilst
quite dispelling any suspicion of Toppian injus-
tice to Gregory, has served the useful purpose of
throwing light upon a matter which certainly
needed publicity, but which the “respectable”
press had endeavored to keep dark.—X.

Sydney Daily Telegraph, having, ap-
parently, made a good “strike” with its special
“ Building Trade ” column, it will be interesting
to observe at what interval of time the Morning
Herald will consider it compatible with its
dignity to follow the example. Although Granny
never by any chance hits on an idea of her own,
she is careful to bring along her “crib” in a
casual sort of way, and when, as it were, nobody
is looking.
Things in the building-line now boom in
Melbourne. All over the city new buildings are
going up and old ones are being altered and
added to ; and in the suburbs—especially Bruns-
wick—dwellings are being erected on every piece
of vacant land. Every man you meet in Mel-
bourne is prepared to show the exact spot on
which Hordern and Mark Foy are going to build
—and every one differs as to the locality.

The accident to the Perthshire has been
followed by a curiously large 1. umber of similar
mishaps, the case of the Waikato being about the
fifth broken shaft reported since amongst Aus-
tralian shipping alone. This last accident is the
most serious of the lot on account of the vessel’s
lonely position. Moral : Twin-screws.

Melbourne item : Annie Harvey had been
sentenced to 24 hours’ imprisonment for drunken-
ness. Discharged at 9 o’clock on a bitterly cold
night. Hungry—a dish of hominy at 4 o’clock
has little sustaining force five hours later—ill-clad
and penniless, she wandered into Fitzroy Gardens.
A passing constable heard her, with bitterest
irony, crooning “ Home, Sweet Home ! ” and
advised her to go thither. Knowing that if she
fully stated the case to the officer the only result
to her would be twelve months’ “hard” for
vagrancy, she held her peace and wandered away
to pass the long, cold hours as best she might. In
the morning a gardener found her under a bush
dead. The cost of an inquest was at least 255., and
the funeral cost something besides—£l at the lowest
estimate. It is but poor economy to fire a home-
less, thinly-clad woman out of gaol with no money
late on a bitter winter night, and then spend 455.
of Turner’s surplus on her inquest and funeral.

The Deceased Husband’s Brother Bill is
getting through Maoriland Parliament. It has
long been lawful for a man to marry his late
wife’s sister—so many men wanted to marry the
late wife’s younger and less faded sister that the
male elector wouldn’t he happy till he got it.
But until woman got a vote nobody cared a straw
how much she wanted to marry her late husband’s
younger brother. The woman-vote has changed
all that. Besides, M.L. is much troubled about
its declining marriage-rate and birth-rate, and if
any woman who would otherwise remain a widow
can get a chance to marry her late old man’s
brother, and have three children, or if any man
who would otherwise be a lone bachelor is willing
to take over his brother’s widow, it would be a
pity to hinder them. Maoriland’s complaint is
that it is getting very hard to persuade anybody
to marry anybody at all nowadays, and if any-
body is willing to marry somebody, the State
should give every encouragement.

The far-reaching possibilities
of phthisis, in its new category as
an actively-infectious disease, are
only just beginning to be recog-
nised. The well-known Dr. An-
drew Wilson has recently been
calling attention to the risks
healthy passengers on long
voyages run through possible
cabin.mating with the con-
sumptives so often to be
found voyaging for cure or
amelioration. Beyond doubt
the mail-steamer authorities
will shortly be forced by pub-
lic opinion or direct legisla-
tion to provide separate and
special accommodation for the
phthisically-afflicted.
“From 1888 to 1897
the average N.S.W. mortality
from phthisis was three a
day.”—Dr. Tidswell, before
the Tuberculosis Commission.
East Melbourne has for
some time been infested by a
band of idiotic men and youths who
parade the streets at night with
their shirts outside their trousers,
two rows of torches, a man bearing a
big wooden crucifix at their head, and
behind them the fatuous crowd which
would run miles after a three-legged
calf or a Highland regiment. Re-
gardless of the fact that people may
be sick or dying in the surrounding
houses, this insane plagiarism of
the Salvarmy makes night hor-
rible with bad singing and the monotonous
blare of a badly-played cornet. One of these
nights an infidel with a sick wife or child will
expostulate with a gun, and then people will howl
about the “decreasing respect for religion.”

Judge a’Beckett had something to say in
Melb. Divorce Court last week re lovely woman’s
capacity for reckless lying on behalf of herself
and to the detriment of the other fellow. When
the woman happens to be the other fellow’s wife
she is entitled to charge him with the exes, of her
defence, which is usually, says Judge a’B., a per-
jured repetition of the yarn she has told to her
proctor. In the ordinary way she lies with im-
punity, like the average co-respondent who is
supposed to be gallantly attempting to shield the
“ honor of a lady.” A decree nisi for the hus-
band ends the matter. But when the decree
doesn’t come off, owing to circumstances over
which the wife had no control, the Law must take
her perjuries seriously, says Judge a’Beekett.
Wherefore he committed a certain giddy
lady for trial at next Melb. Crim. Court on
a charge of “perfectly useless false swearing.”
This extreme measure will, it is hoped, tend to
deter the fair sex from too much untruthfulness
in the face of overwhelming evidence. Woman is
always a Mrs. Partington where her precious
Virtue is concerned. With her little broom of
bristling perjuries she hopes to sweep back the
tide of evidence.
“ Woman doesn’t reason, she only feels,”
is a new, kind, apologetic axiom, as far as it
goes. How about the unreasoning woman who
doesn’t feel ; the mere attractive, smiling fawner
with no heart, no impulses, no anything save a
few practical ideas and feminine deceits ? What
is Nature’s apology for her ? She doesn’t even fill
an animal want, for the altogether unfeeling one
never goes astray, and rarely succeeds in luring a
man right up to the altar. But she engages the
attention of one, two —perhaps half-a-dozen men
in turn, who finally discover her worthlessness,
and charge it to the discredit of the whole sex.
And she is said to be dangerously frequent these
times. The New Woman is, more or less, the
same old, unreasoning creature, minus all the old,
admirably-foolish impulses.

straining and displacing them, so that the flow
increased every second. A couple of miners were
caught; one was buried instantly, but the other, a
young miner named Lovett, managed to keep on
his feet and scramble up inch by inch as the stuff
poured in. At last, though, the inrush mastered
him, and, a fixture now, he was buried deeper
and deeper. For anyone to go near him was
desperately dangerous; and when his mates
attempted it he implored them to keep back.
“ It’ll be bad enough for two to go under —don’t
make it more,” he said. They listened to
him—for they knew how deadly treacherous
this moving ground is and kept back.
Then an old man hurried up —he had
been working on the same shift. They told him
it was his son who was caught, but they pointed
out the awful danger of going near. “ He’s my
boy, and I’ll try,” was the answer. And then
there was a magnificent scene—a young man pro-
tecting himself on his hands and arms from still-
falling debris, begging the old man to keep back,
and finally appealing to him to think of those at
home; and an old man inspiring the others to
risk everything. It is good to know that young
Lovett was able to drag himself out, and by the
help of the others to reach safety.

A New Australian writes thus from Lama
Rugua :
Luckily the Paraguayan Govt, offered us 100 acres
apiece. We divided up the land and so obtained free
land and free individxial action. Laws we have none ;
therefore we get justice by arbitration with the people as
umpires. As to church and chapel, we let everyone run
his own if he likes. To sum up, we are happy because we
are free.”
This is about the twentieth time the Paraguay
pilgrims have achieved happiness and freedom
since they abandoned Australia. First they got
it in Communism ; then they tried a shandy gaff
—half individualism, half Communism ; noiv they
have achieved their millennium by a return to
pure individualism. Bless their simple hearts !
They could have had as much of that as ever they
wanted over here in this wicked land.

Be that unfortunate “frozen-
beer ” slip in the Encyclopedia
Beitannioa, the present writer saw,
a few years ago, a letter from Mr.
Bain, one of the editors, in reply to
an Australian query on the subject.
He said that he had received many
letters pointing out the error. The
article was, he added, written by
the best authority available, and he
was at a loss to account for the mis-
take. By the way, one edition of
the more popular Chambers ’ En-
cyclopedia had a map of Australia
(colored) in which the Riverina
was given to Victoria.

he had whistled himself dead dry,

“ Strong Joint Be “ B.E.’s ” paragraph
in Bulletin in 5/8/’99. Are not the characteris-
tics of the guttersnipe pretty well the same all
the world over ? The Austral genus gamin is, at
times, (despite “ 8.E.” to the contrary) very smart
at repartee. Instance: At Red fern railway-
station, t’other day, a station-inspector, noted for
his strong personality and bull dog temperament,
was sitting in the Melb. express. Newsboy on
platform kept bothering him with “ Buy a News,
sir?”—and was answered brusquely, “Go to the
devil! ” The youngster, quite unabashed, putting
his thumbs in an old torn waistcoat, critically sur-
veyed the old chap and replied, “ You can thank
God, sir, for your grey hairs.” Wasn’t that humor ?
* * • •
“ Alba ” on gamins :
Dear Bulletin.— If “8.E.” (5/8/’99) will take the
trouble to read my screed of Bulletin, 8/7/’99, he will
find that I didn’t “ eulogise ” the Austral gamin, or anv
gamin whatever. Writer merely said things about the
Rushcutter’s Bay small boy, and the bay isn’t Australia.
Also my par. is merely a peg for “ 8.E.” to hang his
gamin on. And why does he drag in the Dublin omad-
haun ? For three centuries the gamin has been boosted
by continental writers, and every penster who has
sneezed in the dust of the Moulin Rouge yearns to roll
the gamin-log a trifle further. The gamin"bye and large
is, phew ! a master of iniquity at eight, at nine a pimp, at
ten too jaded to call a fiacre or steal a cigarette. The
Paris hospitals used to be full of him. The brilliancy of
the London guttersnipe is embodied in his best joke (he’s
been using it with English insistence for a decade),
“What cheer, guv’nor? Who’s yer ’atter?” varied at
intervals with Voltairian quips from Sloper or Comic
Cuts. So far, the Australian kid hasn’t been written
about; also he isn’t a long way off and doesn’t call his
mother a “cow” in mellifluous French, therefore he fails
to interest. Ask any unbiassed French or English teacher
in Australia whether young Cornstalk isn’t as keen and
humor-blessed as the old-world hopefuls. Have seen him
lurk around the various Australian quays to pelt Irish
immigrants (no offence to “ 8.E.”) with meat-fed derision
—derision may not be humor, but it’s a near relative—
and the flittering immigrant generally responded with
a brick or us “bit av a shtick.” “B.E. needn t have

development of fawn arises from scarcity of spuds in his
I'ttle inside. Anyhow, “ B.E. needn t compare him with

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, August 15, 18110.
My Dear Myee,—
Considerable agitation since definite news got
abroad of the vice regal September gaieties. Two
Beauchamp balls are fixed for Sept. 9th and 14th,
and a garden-party for Sept. 31. Weigh against
this tlierumored overhauling of the V. H. visiting-
list and you will understand why some people are
only just beginning to be really unhappy.
About these evening parties—one hears such
curious accounts. So far press and prestige have
been severely uninvited, which drives one on to
hearsay. The clergy, staffs of nurses, M’sP., have
all been up to spend evenings. Many pretty
society women, who think things , must be dull
without them, haven’t had their company re-
quested yet. It reads like the style of entertain-
ment in an Edition de Luxe of old English
evenings given to the Chatelaine’s Sunday-school
class, or the squire’s more respectable tenants.
Lady Mary and Lady Bertha sing duets. Mr.
Victor Corkran plays the piano. Printed cata-
logues of His Ex. ’s treasures fill in the blanks.
Then supper and early adieux, naturally.
Everyone feels that Govt. House is trying very,
very hard to be Nice. Nobody ever felt so posi-
tive on that point about any other Gov. But con-
sider human nature for one minute. Then you will
understand—as well as anything of this kind can
be uinlerstanded—why the evening-party people
wonder if they ought to take it as a slight that
they have been asked to duets and catalogues that
Society has not been asked to ; also, why the
Society people can’t make up their minds whether
Govt. House has been tossing then* a compliment
or otherwise in leaving them out of the catalogues,
etc. In the meantime, there are two very worried-
looking young men in this city—the Gov. and his
secretary. Why doesn’t a cousin, or a sister, or an
aunt advise His Ex. that to take life seriously at
2(5 may be leaving nothing but frivol for old age?
Then, if that does not touch him, nothing will.
Speaking of sisters, Lady Mary goes home in
October. A certain young lady and . her mother
journey Londonwards by the saii.e boat. Lis Ex.
will then be sisterless. What offers?
Have you seen His Ex.’s contribution to the
“Souvenir Book,” published by the Press Bazaar?
The cruelty of it: written in French. It borrows
Alphonse Karr’s sentiment about thorns and roses,
“For my part, I am glad that the thorns have
roses.” Signed, “ Beauchamp.” For our part, we
are glad H.E. has noticed the roses. Signed,
“All Women.” Considering all things, that
autograph - book is the gem of the Fair.
It has been turned out beautifully, in
blue covers and shiny paper, and sold cheaply
for half-a-crown. You get a glimpse into all sorts
and conditions of minds, musical, theatrical, vice-
regal, medical. Mr. and Mrs. Brough and Harry
Rickards are the only theatricals represented. The
Broughs quote passages from the “Physician”
and “ A Pair of Spectacles ” and ’Arry unburdens
himself of a good and heavy sentiment about
philantliropy. Colonel Bell breaks into gaudy
language: “For your holy cause, I fain would
harness the very storms, and coin the hurricanes
into golden syllables.” Next, please. And you
come upon Lord Brassey’s Browning quote.
“It is not what man does do which exalts him,
but what a man would do.” Now, remember that,
Victoria. For the point of a quotation is in its
application. Artists make a fine show, but chiefly
of work we have seen before. Wiegand and 11.
Goring-Thomas are the only composers who re-
sponded. But the poets have come out strongly ;
Henry Lawson alone is missing. His democratic
soul revolted, and no persuasion could induce to
poetry under vice-regal patronage.
Last Thursday saw the opening of the Fair.
His Ex. who did the deed on a long legged plat-
form situated at the far end of the Hall, had to be
politically engineered through the dense crowds
before he could mount. Some of the V.R. party
were swallowed whole by the mob. G. H. Reid
to the rescue. He bravely fished up Lady Bertha
from the crowd, and hauled up two other platform
ladies later on. On the structure were Lord
Beauchamp, Ladies Mary and Bertha, Hon.
Violet, Mr. Corkran, George and Mrs. Reid,
Mayoress Harris, Mr. H. Levy (Chairman of
Committee), Mr. Druce (secretary or general
manager), “Mister James,” of the Herald, and
ever so many other Bazaar representatives. Mr.
Clarence Backhouse, the Fair’s architect, should
have been there, but was not. On the other hand
—but that is a different story.
Stall-holders who looked forward to testing their
bazaar smiles and fancy prizes on His Ex. were
keenly disappointed. The day before the Fair
they all received orders not to ask the Governor to
buy. He had sent along a cheque for £3O
on condition that nobody asked him to buy as
much as a “dip.” But, although he did not
linger over erewelled slippers and just as unkind
smoking-caps, every stall in the Fair was blessed
by a brief visit and a hand-shake.
And, re this, I witnessed one strange little
pathetic incident. His Ex. had shaken hands
with the head of one stall, and had passed on ;
suddenly the stall-holder was smitten with the
recollection of a fat, hard-working lady friend,
delving away at the eatables and things at the
back of the stall. t She tore breathlessly after His
Ex. and urged him to come back for a minute.
She hauled her assistant up to the counter, intro-
duced her emphatically by name, and watched the
slim, vice-regal hand close briefly round her friend’s
fat fingers. Of course everyone at the Fair is
charitable. But that was the only woman who
sho.wed it in a really large way.
Why does Lady Mary alternate so puzzlingly in
her mode of dressing ? One day she is smart and
fresh ; on the next she isn’t. At the Fair she
worn a sedate bluish-grey silk, with a little white
tucked yoke and blank lace insertion running
round the skirt. She tips her prim hats well over her
nosoandfavorsthelargein millinery- barly Bertha’s
amiable face was becomingly lightened with a
white silk under tine black net and lace. Among
other visitors there was not much onecould notice as
the Fair frocks put all others in the shade with their
dazzling colors. Fkkeman’s Jol'iinai. tea-room
sported a brilliant shade of rose-red linen with
•white caps and aprons. Mrs. Aronson's attrac-
tive Sydney Mail, store wore black frocks and
hats and large blue aprons branded with the
paper’s name. The 1 Ikhai.D stall was draped in
art green, and waited on by the Misses Curnow
in cream frocks braided with narrow black velvet.
And I liked the black and white striped skirts
and little white lace Etous worn by the Art Union
stall-holders.
Among many charming Fair figures I noticed
mostly a pretty, fair-haired doctor’s wife in a grey
dress with white muslin apron and highly-be-
coming.white Dutch cap, serving egg-beaters on
her badly-situated “Dutch kitchen Mrs. Harry
Levy, at a mauve-tinted soap-stall with a host of
pretty girls in Ion" eel skirts of pale heliotrope
cashmere, tucked silk blouses of the same shade
and largo black hats with strings; Mrs, Willie
Mitchell, selling cigars and cigarettes in cream
voile skirt and silk blouse with a light boa and
rose tints in her hat; Mrs. Lassetter at the same
stall in trailing cream silk with a turquoise hat;
Miss Linda Rundle belpingMrs. Toohey in a sweet
little white book-muslin frock sweeping the
ground with frills and tucks to the knees, and
finished off with a cerise rosette, at the point of
the fichu, and a big plack picture hat, and the Misses
Slee in pretty white muslin frocks and little
toques of pink roses. Actresses were conspicuous
by their absence. Miss Henrietta Watson was
there in clinging black, depreciating her powers
of drawing bazaar coin. “ I can only sell to
Chinamen,” she said. “Other people just'stare
at me and don’t buy; n.y fame hasn’t reached
the Chinamen.” Miss Vara Renny, from the
Brough co., and Miss Roxy Barton were
also serving in black frocks. Miss Inez Bensusan
was in black and white at the art-union stall.
Miss Grace Noble was billed at Mrs. Mitchell’s
stall, but was not there on opening day.
By the way, Mrs. Willie Mitchell’s stall was
more than it looked from the front. You passed
through—if you were a man—and found yourself
in a beautifully-alluring smoking-room with low,
red lights, and oriental tapestries, and velvet
chairs, and women suffering from repulsed
dolls and pin-cushions looked on from the other
end of the room and wondered despondently why
they had never thought of that. To sum lip,
there is much to see at the Fair, but not as much
to buy as one could wish were one inclined that
way. Somestalls, particularly those of Miss Eadith
Walker, Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Harris, - have ex-
quisite needlework to offer. Others can show you
nothing worth looking at. As far as the outside
of the stalls go Mr. Clarence Backhouse has given
everyone the opportunity of an excellent artistic
setting. But the inner sides of the Exhibition,
behind the stalls, are blank and ugly, and a row of
advertisements round the gallery entirely thwarts
the aesthetic impulse of the Fair as a spectacle.
Surely, surely, the art of conversation is passing
into the dead language. The indication is strong
in “novel evenings.” Nobody entertains now
unless the guests can be offered a game to play and
a prize to win—even a prize for the worst player
has to be given as an attraction. To talk away an
evening is impossible. There is nobody to talk to.
An agitated hostess is for over bearing down on
you with a pencil and paper asking how many you
have guessed ? Everyone is rushing about wildly.
There is not even need to provide seats, for no-
body has time to sit down. You must play, play
all the time. A party without a game is con-
sidered an awful bore, and conversation con-
tinues to draw nearer to its death. No doubt
there will be a revolution, or a renaissance soon.
But, in the meantime, “ How d’you do ; have you
got a pencil?”—“Thank you, I have a pencil, but
I have not a programme,” is all the talk that oue
cares to shine in.
And hostesses are racking strange things out of
their brains. The very latest asks guests to bring
along “a portrait of yourself at the age of 10 or
11.” The photos, are mixed, and the guests are
handed pencils and programmes and set to work
identifying a red hook-nose with a little white
blob, and so on. Rather painful for the red hook
when an ingenue exclaims, “To think that your
nose was like that once! ”
I hear that an even-newer novelty consists in
Setting all the females of the party to take their
oots off, mixing them up, and letting the men
pick out the owners. But the dangers in that are
obvious to anyone with a foot over seven.
Speaking of hostesses, there was once a girl of
18 and a woman who didn’t like her. The other
woman was married, and her husband talked too
much to the girl. One day a riding-party, in-
cluding the girl, came to the “other woman’s ”
house. Of course, there was afternoon-tea.
The girl could not reach the sugar-tongs, but
helped herself from the bowl with her finger-
tips. The other woman called to the
servant to take away the bowl and fill it
with fresh sugar. Which was done ! The
girl coloured, everyone felt uncomfortable, the
party decided to leave. Just as they were starting
the girl remarked quietly that if the sugar was
spoilt by her touch, to use the cup and saucer she
had used would contaminate the whole house, and
picking up the cup and saucer (a very expensive
cup and saucer) she dashed both against the wall.
Then she turned on her heel, and walked out of
the house. The wilted, sun-smitten Australian
girl has evidently a little energy left in her still.
In some ways, women haven’t advanced.
This story is told of a clever University girl with
a great grip on mental and moral science. She
married. Shortly after, her husband caught a very
bad cold. Being a grad, with honors, she doctored
him herself, but the cold wasn’t seared by her
philosophy and logic, and got harder and harder.
One night it sounded so agonizing that the Bride-
lb A. determined to try something daring. “I
shall put a mustard leaf on his lung,” she said to
herself. She got up in the middle of the night,
found a mustard leaf, took the candle, and left the
room. When she returned the patient asked
suspiciously what she had been doing. “I went
to get the medical book, darling, to look up where
your lung is ! ”
Speaking of brides, let us hope one doesn’t get
hold of household hints like the following, taken
from a paper with a reputation to save :
Iloi sEiioLD Hints.
Tea made with boiling milk instead of water, and
allowed to stand for four minutes before being poured oil,
is excellent, and very nourishing.
Custard Sauce for the above. —Pint of milk brought to
a boil, and add to it one well-beaten egg and level tea-
spoonful of corn-starch (moistened with a Tittle cold milk),
two teaspoonfuls of sugar. Boil up once and serve.
Nobody can go very far astray in lan-
guage while Home Chat continues to re-
organise the tilings we can say witli safety.
According to this omnipotent authority, Society’s
Small-talk is going to be swept and garnished
with a cruelly careful hand this season. Dear me !
For the. Warning is headed “Society-Mistakes
some Women Make,” and all the words that come
to the tip of one’s tongue irresistibly just now—
with the new Governor and other tilings—are
shown up in their true vulgah light. “One never
hears,” says Home Chat, “what an aristocratic
man,” or “what an aristocratic woman!” The
only expression permissible is “ She looks
thoroughly r/rande dame ! ” or “ What a well-bred
man !” Alas for Potts Point imparting the flavor
of bad language to that “ grande dame / ” Also,
’tis bad form to say that anyone is stylish; you
must put it that “she has great style.” The
wickedness of having “my photo taken” won’t
appeal to Pott’s Point (which has its “ photo
took,”) but people from everywhere may feel
ashamed of themselves when Home Chat points
to the unspeakable awfulness of asking “Do you
cycle?” From these articles you can gather
that London society has its own sore point.
“Don’t speak of ‘ The Waleses,’ of ‘The‘Con-
naughts,’ in alluding to the Royal Family.” Don’t
say “Thank you, I will take some of yours,” when
the hostess asks you will you take beef or chicken.
Don’t say, “I am very partial to champagne.”
Then they do say these things in London!
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“The ‘First-born of Egypt’ (as Shakespeaie
called ‘the Naioest’ of his day) took care that
Melb. Hunt Club ball (Aug. 10t.li) was just as
frilly as when Mrs. Freeman-Thomas held the
reins and vowed she’d show the Natives what a
proper ‘Pink Dance’ should be. This year, as
heretofore, ‘pink’ (i.e., rod) lamps, draping*,
etc., shed a rosy glow over the painted, decorated
faces, inseparable from powdered hair.
“Sporting ‘pink’ failed to transform Gov.
Brassey into a rollicking fox-hunter —it showed
him up as a tired-out Patriarch, wearing a jaded
heart on. his gaudy sleeve. Lady B.’s rich black
gown, displayed, an under-dress of jetted net over
ivory satin. Ladies Raglan and Violet Somerset
and Mrs. Pakenhaih, following their leader in all-
black single file, between two rows of welcoming
committee,’had the air of mourners at a State
fir.ral. Lengthy Aide Nevill’s pink coat-tails
seemed yards long—there was no end to ’em.
“Fair-haired Mrs, Goo. Chirnside, in shim-
mering snaky black and diamonds ad lib.,
was one of the successes on view. Miss
Florence Stanbridge, the Daylesfoicl heiress,
sported the white satin and ‘ pink ’ scarf of com-
mittee. Her imported frock was smartened by a
side panel of arum, lilies in folded satin. Gentle
boy-aide Cecil stood about with a fashionable
dancing-mistress, whose style of beauty took
kindly to powder and patches, and who, given a
few more inches of height, would have shone out
resplendently.
“ White satin was the feature of the hour. A
blonde beauty in gown of same, with two gradu-
ated flounces of impressive lace, fly-away waist
scarf of turquoise tulle, bouquet of red carnations
and plumes, blue, black and white on hair, looked
the whole company in the face in righteous
triumph. Handsome Miss Berry unwisely coif-
fured her powdered hair in classic style. Floured
thatch can be coquettish or stately, but “ artistic ”
methods don’t go with it, somehow. It flourished
in Salons, not studios.
“ Ball-room etiquette has turned topsy-turvey
since old-young ladies were new. Now, naioest
spring-chickens pace the floor ‘on their own,’
arms twined behind lest folks should call them
flat-chested. If plump arms are parader’s
speciality, akimbo attitude goes well. He-dancers
shake off partners when and where it suits them.:
Sure as you spot a flntterer escorted back to
mamma’s side every time, you bet she's not a
somebody.
“ ‘ Praise Him from whom nil blessings
flow,’ that the support of a male arm is no
longer inseparable from ball-room locomotion.
Many a woman has been embittered for life
through famishing all the evening with delicacies
going to waste in the next room, just for want of
an escorting arm, in a sleeve smelling of moth-
powder. To this very day, in the back-blocks,
where fashions change slowly or not at all, a pasty-
faced youth offers his elbow as impressively as if
it were first prize in Tatt.’s sweep. At a recent
extra-smart local hop, a young and handsome
heiress met half-way and rounded up all dilatory
or short-sighted liar tilers fumbling through the
crowd on her tracks.
“At a ball given by His Excellency and Her
Excellency at one gubernatorial establishment,
beer was liberally supplied literally in buckets—
stable buckets—to the immense disgust of the
high-livers below stairs. At another “treat”
given by the same august couple a few weeks back
to a portion of the local military, seven minutes
and a half were allowed for refreshments, with
the result that many of the warriors declined to
join in the stampede, and went empty away.
“An Australian capital last week’witnessed its
most exalted personage driving a pair in a manner
that would have earned a vegetable-hawker three
months for negligence. Pedestrians scattered and
went indoors, cyclists dismounted and did like-
wise, and other drivers followed the advice of old
Coroner Youl, ‘ Pull hard to the left, shut your
eyes, and say as much of the Lord's prayer as you
can remember.’ Eventually things looked so
serious that the groom at the side of the exalted
personage was forced to the awful extremity of
taking the reins of his master’s hands in order
to get the owner home with a whole neck.
Master is evidently bent on falling some more.
“ Information went out to the councillors and a
few friends that the Mayor had expressed a wish
that as many as could should wear the kilts of
Scotland at the Caledonian knee-show in (he
Town Hall, and there was a wild
round on Wednesday to hire them whei°
ever they could be procured. But as few
of these outsiders appeared on Friday night
in the abbreviated pleats, it is evident
the trying-on had unfavorable results, or the
knees of Englishmen and Paddies were not built
for parade. Hon. W. Knox, who showed a broad
expanse of shirt in the first part of the evening,
and a big strip, of leg when lie had metamorphosed
himself into a Scotchman in the second part, laid
on quite the most swagger of all the braw
Icelanders on show.
“ A Melb. doctor wrote to Henrietta Watson
asking if her stage-throes (‘ King's Musketeer ’)
represented the effects of any ‘known poison.’
Miladi, answering cheerfully in the negative,
pointed out that on the boards ‘effect’ is the guid-
ing star of every situation. Truth is almighty,
but you’d simply empty the theatre if you at-
tempted realistic bilious, colicky, or convulsed
poison-symptoms. Still, she said, if her corres-
pondent undertook to coach her in the fatal finale
of a genuine poisoning case, no less suitable for
stage-production than her present ‘ business,’ she
would be delighted to include realism in tier bag of
tricks. After all, it was probably some antique
rare poison which released the world of Miladi,
considering that she extracted it from an heirloom
sapphire.
“ At a recent seance in Melbourne, a young lady
who had come in the disguise of an elderly aunt
to test the proceedings, got a nasty ‘slap across
the mouth ’ from the ruffled spernt of a Red
Indian. She made an inquisitive grab at the
vision, and having divested it of some gauzy
veilings and, a black feather, exclaimed— ‘ You
wicked wretch, T have exposed you ! ’ whereunon
the soul of the Indian hit out as aforesaid. The
credulous ‘ circle ’ cried in the darkness for some-
body to turn on the gas, and when the light came
the medium (late of Sydney) was discovered in a
state of partial undress and furious excitement.
But still the game of ‘manifestations’ goes on,
and the business of this particular lady—who is
tall, stout, and most ungliostly—will be all the
brisker for the advt. An exposed medium com-
mands the warm support of good spiritualists for
the next few Weeks. They rally up with their
half-crowns, and invite the impostor to convince
them more than ever, and the impostor supplies
them with peaceful manifestations until their
faith is fully restored. Human nature, I am
afraid, has a fine capacity for believing in any-
thing except plain hard Truth.

No. 2.—The Postman.
A rural postman writes : “I desire to add this
unsolicited testimony to the sterling qualities of
Dr. Tibbies’ Yi-Cocoa. I am a rural postman,
and exposed to all kinds of weather. I have used
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Oocoa daily this last eleven
months, and I believe that I can do my work with
less fatigue since I have used it. I can honestly
recommend to my fellow postmen Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-
Oocoa for its sustaining qualities.”
Of late years many new manufactures, rejoicing
in a multiplicity of names, have been brought
before the public notice, but there are none which
have bounded into favor so readily as has Dr.
Tibbies’ Yi-Cocoa. Throughout the country its
sales have increased with great rapidity, and an
article which only a few years back was unheard
of, has now become one of the most popular
beverages of the people.
Merit, and merit alone, is what is claimed for
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, and the Proprietors are
prepared to send to any reader who names The
Bulletin (a post-card will do) a dainty sample tin
of Dr. Tibbies’ Yi-Cocoa free and post-paid.
There is no magic in all this. It is a plain, honest,
straightforward offer. It is done to introduce the
merits of Vi-Cocoa into every home. Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, as a concentrated form of nourishment
and vitality, is invaluable; nay, more than this,
for to all who wish to face the strife and battle of
life with greater endurance and more sustained
exertion, it is absolutely indispensable.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
chemists, grocers and stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 269 George-street, Sydney.*

Which is the easiest, to know or to find

has been another great invention discovered in the
manufacture of kerosene vapour stoves, which en-
tirely eclipses the Primus. Messrs. M'Lean Bros,
and Rigg, Ltd., of Melbourne and Sydney, have
just landed, and are exhibiting daily, the “ Juwel”
vapour kerosene stoves. This stove is constructed
on entirely new lines. The burner is connected
direct from the reservoir. It has no tubes to
choke up, and can be cleaned out in a moment by
the most inexperienced. With each stove are
supplied a duplicate set of washers and screw-
wrench, thus meeting the practical requirements
of those residing in the backblocks and country
districts. For particulars write direct to M‘Lean

PERSONAL ITEMS.
S.A. has a 100-year-old pioneer in Mrs.
John White, who completed the century July 25.
The old lady came to S.A. in the Forties, some
time before Premier Kingston formed his present
Ministry.
J. H. Symon, Q.C., S.A.’s foremost lawyer
and Federal aspirant, who is travelling England
and the Continent, has been in bad health ever
since he left Australia. He is believed to have
made a small fortune out of the recent Westralian
market rise.
Rabbi Davis, tvho entered his 71st year
this week, was born in London, but has spent 37
years in Sydney. The Sydney Synagogue is
largely the work of his hands. Before coming to
Australia he officiated as Rabbi at Portsmouth
(Eng.) and in Jamaica.
North-coasters have been highly tickled
over the shindy between Perry, M.L.A. for Bal-
lina, and Premier Reid, and Perry’s invitation
to “ come outside.” Perry is usually the quietest
little man breathing, and is about as good for a
“scrap” as Fat George is for 100 yards in
“ evens.”
King O’Malley has definitely given
S.A. politics best, and has gone back to Mel-
bourne and life-assurance agency. He will, how-
ever, be heard of again in Adelaide, because,
through Glynn, M.P., he has issued seven writs
against various political opponents claiming
damages.
Premier Kingston’s friends are again very
concerned about his ill-health. The usually
robust S.A. Premier was so broken down some days
ago that he was even forced to absent himself
from Parliament, and his medical adviser predicts
a complete collapse unless the S.A. democratic
leader takes a holiday.
R. E. O’Connor, whose 48th birthday
passed the other day, took his M.A. degree at the
age of 20. While a law-student he worked at
journalism, his best work going into the defunct
Echo, a Fairfax evening production. He is one of
t ie few N.S. W. politicians who have not changed
their principles with the times.
A. B. Robinson, commercial editor of the
Age— -known in the city as “ little Duppy ” —is
off to London on a holiday trip. Duppy is very
much trusted in Collins-st. Bankers defer to him,
and he is probably the only man in Melbourne who
will dare to enter the board-room of a bank while
the directors are sitting, without the formality of
an introduction. Likewise, he is David Syme’s
right-hand man in business matters, and is as
solid as he is fat.
It was characteristic or the deceased
N.S.W. millionaire, Thomas Walker—he really
was a millionaire, for he left his daughter quite
two millions—that he would never, if he could
possibly avoid it, use a new sheet of paper even in
writing an important business communication ;
his plan was to tear off and use the waste leaf of a
note that he had received. Also, he would never
use a stamp if he could have a letter sent by
hand.
Premier Reid’s appointment of him-
self tjN.S. Wales Attorney-
was a judicious
move—for two reasons. First,
because if he were to go out
of office he would go back
to the Bar with an Attorney-
General’s prestige—which
usually means a good deal,
however little it may mean
in his case. Junior work he
cannot now accept, and as
a Q.C. his A.G.-ship will
help considerably. Second-
ly, if he remains in office,
anything might happen.
For instance, if the Chief-
Justiceship, or a Puisne-
Judgeship were to become
vacant, the Attorney -
General of the day would
have the right of nomina-
tion, and it has been a good
tradition with Attorney -
Generals that they have
rarely been able to discover
anyone better fitted for vacan-
cies than themselves. So G. H.
Reid would fall into a legal and financial haven
of rest, and would be another example of the pro-
verbial luck of members of his own Cabinet in
securing well-paid positions to retire into when
the electors have no further use for them. Be-
sides, he would be the only one in the running—
as neither Want, O'Connor.. Pilcher, nor Barton
will take judgeships.
At latest, George Dean, the North Shore
wife-poisoner, was in Goulburn Gaol. He expects
his discharge at the end of seven years ; and is
likely to get it, as most authorities agree that the
sentence of 14 years would have been upset had
prisoner had the means of appealing to the Privy
Council. Dean has now served over four years.
Foster Rogers, the man who troubled last
Vic. Assembly with his Wealth Tax scheme,
seems to have buiot forth again in the form of a
sixpenny magazine. The first number of “ The
Commonwealth ” published in Melb., the other
day, contained four weighty items by Foster
Rogers, and the facsimile of a post-card written
to the same Rogers by Gladstone. So it is clear
to the proverbial blind man that the amusing
Rogers intends to “ put up ” for the Federal Par-
liament.
The daring printer ! S.A. Governor Ten-
nyson has lately presented Adelaide Library with
all that could ever be found of the original MS.
of the Dedication in which, in ’5l, the poet ac-
knowledged the gift of the Laureateship—“ the
laurel greener from the brow,” &c. The only
verses are the 2nd, sth, 6th, and Bth ; and the
MS. shows that it was the printer and not the
bard who numbered the stanzas. Probably the
poor man had just been “ setting ” an auction-sale
catalogue.
Governor Beauchamp’s front name is
William. The N.S.W. public has already decided
that it can’t call him “Bill,” or “Billy -as it
certainly would if he had a square jaw, owned
“horses” and smoked a briar-root. But it has
not yet finally made up its mind whether Jd.Fx.
is to be William or Willie. At present it looks
rather like Willie.
A certain influential Rockhampton citizen
called upon R.C. Bishop Higgims during his
recent stay in that city, and when Dean Slattery
came out to say the bishop was engaged, he found
the caller cuddling one of the hotel maids. Oh,
if that's what you want his lordship about, said
the Dean, “come on over to the church and 111
fix you up myself.”
Earl Beauchamp will lay the foundation-
stone of a new C. of E. building at Nowra
(N.S.W.) on 22nd inst. Has any N.S.W.
Governor laid a church stone since Gov. Mac-
quarie laid that of St. Mary’s on 20th Oct., 1821?
The same Governor had previously laid the
foundation-stones of St. Andrew’s, Sydney, and
St. Matthew’s, Windsor.
The hairy pastor Bevan has gone off again
—to America this time, to attend a Congregational
Congress. Within the last three years he has
made two prolonged tours in England and M.L.,
and his flock begins to wonder what it pays him
£lOOO a-year for. Apparently for having a rollick-
ing good time and doing his best to keep up his
resemblance to Henrick Ibsen.
“ F.G.F.” : By a curious coincidence, just
before recent par. about Ricciotti Garibaldi ap-
peared in Bulletin, the writer was shown a pro-
missory-note, signed by Ricciotti when in Mel-
bourne at time mentioned. Holder rather values
the document for its name associations, but, all
the same, he would part with it at face value.
Autograph-collectors please note.

“Well,” said the English visitor-to-
Sydney, “ I have attended your Parliament; I
have heard your Reid, and seen your Barton;
and I can’t say lam impressed. Have you no
distinguished men at all in this country ?’’
“ Well, yes,” replied the Australian, stroking his
beard reflectively, “we have two men who would
be distinguished in any country. We have—er—
Meagher; and we have —er —Norton.’’
THE SINS WE HAVE
MISSED.
“My wife did get on to
me about that Gaybody girl
“ Hard luck, old man. Pm sure she'd no reason
to."
“ I know — that's what I'm worrying about."
Ex-Gov. Henry Norman visits M‘llwraith
pretty often, so London letters tell, and the two
argue the Federation question for all it’s worth.
The old Governor, who was always a clean-handed,
honorable warrior, is an out-and-out Federation-
ist, but his opinions have been very little quoted
in Bananaland. They’re too busy picking up
Barlow’s and Unmack’s pearls of wisdom up
Queen-street way.
The Tweed and Brunswick Advocate
(Murwillumbah, N.S.W.) is now run by two
partners rejoicing in the names of .Lean and
Luney. But things might be worse: sometimes
the poor country editor is both.
John Moffatt, pioneer of copper-mining
in N.Q. and of tin-mining at Herberton, is a
curious combination of oddities. Taken in trie
rough, he wears the belt as the best all-round
mining man in Australia. Probably not as
big a speculator as Lansell ; he does more
good with his money. Moffat opens new
fields, and Lansell, after his sad experi-
ence in that direction, confines him-
self to th>* further development of
old ones, 9-10ths of his money go-
ing into Bendigo mines and
much more coming out of them,
by the way. Moffat leaves
Brokenhillionaires behind and
Mt. Morganaires standing at the
post—in fact, the latter are too
miserable a mining crowd to be
reckoned in the same category
with Moffat. Originally a store-
keeper at Drake, N.S.W., then
a tin-buyer and smelter in the
N.E. districts, he afterwards es-
tablished tin-smelting works at
Herberton. Opened up the tin-
mines for many miles around,
then opened Chillagoe some 10
years ago, and subsequently Mt.
Garnet; in both of which enter-
prises he still retains very large
interests. Some nine years ago
he sold Montalbion mine in
England—cash consideration,
.£27,000. Two shafts had been
sunk a considerable distance
apart in the property, and the
lode being of same size and
quality in each, the assump-
tion was that it would be
found likewise between. Work
proved otherwise —each shaft,
it turned out, was sunk on a
pipe of ore, instead of in a con-
tinuous lode, leaving next to
nothing between. Moffat
handed back the £27,000, to the amazement of the
English speculators, who must have nearly died
from shock. His friends swore at his folly, but
Moffat vvas adamant, and the money was re-
turned. A hobby of his is equipping and sending
out prospecting parties all over N.Q., giving each
man a share in his discoveries. Many have taken
advantage of his enterprise in this direction. He
is also fond of sending veteran Scotchmen on a
trip ’Onie. One might travel a long way in
North Queensland before finding a man who
begrudges John Moffat his huge fortune as the
founder of the Chillagoe and Mt. Garnet groups
of copper-mines.
Dr. Breton, who lived in turn in Queens-
land, S.A., N.S.W., and Vic., and did good sur-
gical work in all, has died at the age of 71. He
was son of Colonel Breton, who had chaige of
Tasmania’s soldiery and bulked large in early Tas-
manian history. The doctor leaves a family of
eight, two of whom reside in N.S.W.
John Colton, aged 76, one of S.A.’s ex-
Premiers, is, at time of writing, dangerously ill.
John, who is very much like General Booth in
appearance, is one of the pillars of S.A. Method-
ism, and was known in politics as the “ holy sad-
dler.” He was an ordinary politician, but he gave
Kingston his first Ministerial billet in 1884.
The question of appointing a N.S.W.
Parliamentary committee to examine lunatic
“ Cress well,” the alleged Roger Tichborne, turns
simply on the question whether Drs. M‘Cormiek
and Fiaschi spoke the truth about this man in
December, ’97. Justice Manning authorised Drs.
M‘C. and F. to report on various Cresswellian
matters, particularly as to the notorious tattoo-
marks without which no long-lost Roger could be
genuine. The medical examiners, men of the
highest surgical and personal repute, reported
that Cresswell had no tattoo-marks on the arms,
nor any marks or scars indicating the obliteration
of tattoo-marks. Also, they reported him to be
two inches shorter than the “ real Sir Roger.”
“ J.A.C.” : Having known Ricciotti Gari-
baldi well, let me supplement your par. of 29/7/’99.
Ricciotti landed in Melbourne, over 20 years ago
(under a pseudonym), with his wife (Irish) and
family. His first employment in Australia was
lumping coal on the Melb. wharves. Next tried
the drapery business, and then received a tem-
porary engagement as extra-secretary in the Ser-
vice Govt. We next find him engaged in construct-
ing a colossal incubator, capable of hatching 500
doz. eggs at a time (the story goes that it exploded,
with great slaughter); then he was a pastry-cook,
and afterwards a fishmonger. All failures ; be-
cause he selected always those enterprises for
which he was specially ■unfitted. It may have
been forgotten that during the Franco-Prussian
war, at the battle of Dijon, he captured the only
flag lost by the Germans during the campaign.
During the recent demolition of Dunedin
(M.L.) gaol (the first of its kind built in the South
Island of M.L.) to make room for the new
Supreme Court, it was found necessary to disin-
ter the bones of three murderers who had been
hanged and buried in the gaol yard. These were
duly dug up and left about promiscuously, whilst
awaiting authority for removal to the “ conse-
crated” kirk-yard.” Meanwhile, someone stole the
skull of one of the hanged—Captain Jarvey.
Jarvey was one of the first men executed in Otago.
He poisoned his wife under particularly revolting
circumstances, and the poor victim was at the last
fully cognisant of her husband’s guilt. She con-
fided in her daughter, pledging her to secrecy, and
the gallant captain might have escaped but for
too early shaping his course for another petticoat.
The daughter resented it, gave him away to the
law, and now, when Gabriel toots his horn, the
captain will have some difficulty in picking up his
moorings without his “top gear.”
Mr. Edward Priestman, indefatigable bar-
racker for the alleged nobleman in Parramatta
Lunatic Asylum, has published a book entitled
“ The Tichborne Mystery. On the Verge of Solu-
tion,” which it certainly isn’t. All the same, Mr.
Priestman’s carefully compiled budget of facts,
statements and theories will nearly convince any
old student of the Tichborne Case that Roger
Tichborne didn’t get drowned at sea, but came to
Australia in the original ship “Bella,” said
“Bella” having been unlawfully converted into
the “Osprey ”en route. Granting the probability
of Roger’s landing a,t Melbourne and subsequent
acquaintance with sundry Australians who knew
him under various names, the impossibility of the
supposed Tichborne being identical with the
lunatic known as Cresswell in Parramatta Asylum
remains almost as strong as ever. It seems more
likely that the mystery surrounding Cresswell has
been created by the Asylum doctors, who were
unfavorable to the frequent demands for his
release.
Chief-Justice Griffith is quietly moving in
Queensland law circles for the abolition of the
barristerial wig and gown. Among, the leading
men in the profession the opposition is small, but
the dimmer lights blink sulkily and threaten to
splutter.
A REASONABLE QUESTION.
CHILD (listening to Salvation Army captain offer-
ing up a prayer ): “ Grandmamma, is God
very deaf?”
Quaint “birth” notice from S.A. papers
of recent date :
Bright. —On the 30th June, 1819, within the sound of
Bow Bells, the wife of Edward Bright—a son (Henry
Edward, now of South Australia).
But it served a purpose, nevertheless; for most
people had supposed the ancient ex-Minister dead
years ago. For a decade he had been only a
memory; but that memory sparkled with some
of the most delightful mal-aproposisms which the
S.A. Parliament has sniggered over in 50 years.
Gov. Brassey apparently thinks himself a
strong goer for the Governor - Generalship.
(The late Hopetoun modestly announced that he
would accept if pressed.) Uncle Tom’s utterances
of the last three months have consisted mainly of
two things—(l) a denial of the rumor that he is
retiring with the present year, and (2) a fulsome
eulogy of Barton, Turner, Reid, Deakin, and the
rest of the Federal leaders. The laborious way in
which Baron Brassey has been shovelling the jam
on to these politicians can have but one interpre-
tation.

They were on strike, and squatter Baijove
thought to starve them into submission by stop-
ping rations. Next day he strolled into the hut
and peered into an oil-drum hanging over the
fire. The oil-drum contained two fine legs of
mutton with a quantity of pig-weed on top.
Afterwards he said to the storekeeper: “It’s no
use stoping the wations; the bwutes are eating
gwass.”

off with a pig, and I left with my booty in a

What the evaporation is in a dry season in
the Australian way-back is shown by the figures
of the Broken Hili Water Supply. On June 30 of
last year the reservoir—a creek dammed back-
contained by measurement 1,966,482,000 gallons.
On December 31 it contained 1,157,491,000 gal.—
808,991,000 gal. less. Yet only 87,482,000 gal. had
been supplied to consumers. The loss was thus
more than eight times greater than the quantity
sold. And that is not allowing for the couple of
showers which reached the reservoir, either. The
loss would probably amount in an average year to
sft. of water.

“Ben Sun”: The fag-end of the road v.
rail competition in Yic. is a grim scarcity of work.
Teamsters travel nights and Sundays (several
passing now, 12.30 a.m.) and have to cringe to
storekeepers for the job. Two years ago these
men used to swear from their load tops at
sprightly, willing horses ; now, most of them
crawl beside, and flog, skeletons. What cruelty
for a crust! —and when is the promised prosperity
coming along ?

“N. 8.”: Our little township of Bear Hill
(N.S.W.) was recently thrown into a flutter of
social excitement over the marriage of Algernon
Norman Biljim Smithers to Miss Virginia Hogg.
The bridegroom is a well-known and widely-re-
spected ’possum-trapper. The ceremony took
place at the local Anglican Church, which was not
prettily decorated for the occasion. The bride-
groom was tastefully attired in a pair of new
brown canvas shoes, white socks (also new), old
grey moles, a soft shirt of indistinguishable color,
and a white tie. The latter was whispered to be
a present from the bride. He had discarded his
characteristic cardigan for a vest and bob-tailed
coat, borrowed for the occasion from a friendly
miner. When the ceremony was concluded the
happy couple returned to the bride’s late resi-
dence ; her luggage, consisting of a tin dish, an
old oven, and some parcels of clothes, was packed
on a wheel-barrow ; and the happy pair started on
foot over heavy roads for the bridegroom’s heredi-
tary humpy, seven miles away in a sylvan dell.
A number of well-wishing friends accompanied
them nearly two miles on the way and played
operatic selections on a horn, nine pairs of tin
plates, and seven kerosene-tins. The affairfis re-
garded among society people as the most pictur-
esque event of the kind that has taken place in
the district.
When the
wife of Grib-
ble, of Janko,
ran away from
him, Gribble
was highly in-
dignant, and
remonstrated
in public-
houses and
places with
much purple
language, ex-
plaining that
it was “ on-
reasonable. ” It
was not for
some weeks
that Gribble’s
friends dis-
covered that
his only griev-
ance lay in the
fact that Mrs.
Gribble and
her friend had
not taken the
'hildren with
them. Gribble
made untiring
efforts to dis-
co v er the
whereabouts of
the runaways.
He’d show
them, he said.
But it was not
till a year later
that he re-
ceived authen-
tic informa-
tion, and then
his friends
looked forward
confidently to
a foul murder.
But Gribble
set to work
with the tur-
bulent emo-
tions of anout-
raged husband, and indited a letter to the man,
enclosing a bill for the expenses of a housekeeper
for one year and seven weeks.

Memo, for the author of “Hymns, Ancient
and Modern ” :
MUSIC’S FATAL CHARMS.
THE TUNES THAT KILLED THE CATERPILLARS.
[DAILY MAIL TBLHGRAM.]
Nmv York, Monday.
American farmers are reported to have just discovered
that music is an important aid to agriculture. For the
past two months orchards throughout the East have been
suffering from a plague of caterpillars, which have been
defying all attempts at extermination. A few days ago,
a farmer’s wife in the Catskill district happened to blow
a horn under an apple tree, and was astonished to see
showers of the caterpillars fall to the ground. The news
spread through the town. A band was hired to play
lively tunes in the afflicted orchards. The effect was that
the trees were speedily cleared of caterpillars, which
were piled in heaps and destroyed. The farmers are now
buying cornets, trombones, and drums, or employing
bands to assist in fighting the pest. Hundreds of organ-
grinders are hurrying from all the surrounding districts
to grind the caterpillars to their doom.
THINNING 'EM OUT.
KIND LADY : “ You young scoundrel, leave him
alone this instant! Do you want to kill your
poor little brother? ”
THE PUG: “ Don’t matter; got plenty more at
home !”
“ Aloombah ” (Q.) : The aboriginals up
here make blankets from the inner bark of the
“kurrajong.” It is stripped and pounded with
stones until it becomes very pliable. These
blankets are very warm.

“ Cecil F.” : Ever seen a bull-frog smoke?
Lost ten dollars in odds against the event once in
Penang. Modus operandi: Open
frog’s mouth, insert end of lit
cigarette, and the animal, in
the effort to swallow air (frog’s
way of breathing) will inhale
and then £ hale smoke. Quaint
to see a big fellow squatting on
the table, puffing away and
making no attempt to “clear”
—the novelty of the situation
apparently paralysing him.

Rev. Chalmers vigorously
denies that all the Papuan tribes
deserve the appellation of
savages. Many of them (he
asserts) are well up in the scale
of civilisation, living in settle-
ments and practising agricul-
ture. Mr. Chalmers also draws
attention to the extraordinary
length of the houses of the Fly
River natives. One of these
measured 692 ft. in length, and
formed the residence of many
families, each of which had a
section assigned it. Com-
munism with a vengeance !

“ C.F.” : In answer to
“David” (B. 22/7/’99), I must
maintain that boas and pythons
swallow their prey head- first.
Also, I’ve probably seen and
shot more samburthan “David,”
yet never found one with greater
horn-spread than 4ft.
An aboriginal recently paralysed a
N.S.W. country bookseller by asking for a
ballroom-guide. Explained that he had
come from Gippsland, and was teaching the
local darkies the “poetry of motion.”
“ Pukaki ” : There is probably greater
race-diversity in Maoriland than in any other pro-
vince save Mongrelia. To begin with, Maoris
intermix freely with the whites. Plenty of men,
especially army officers and native Judges, have
married Maori princesses, owners, in their own
sweet right, of thousands of broad acres. (Strange
to say, no missionary seems to have thought of
this dodge.) The most considerable foreign ele-
ment, of course, is the Austrian, who muster
some 5000 on the gumfields. At Akaroa there is
a considerable French population. Capt. Stanley
(brother of the Dean), who brought about the
annexation by Britain, was a bit too “previous ”
for the French ; but, as it was, two shiploads of
Breton emigrants were landed. Half of Akaroa
town is still occupied by them. There are large
German settlements in Nelson and Taranaki.
(The German church at Upper Moutere is the
most picturesque building in M.L.). Norsewood
and Dannevirke districts are given up to Scandi-
navians, who, like the Germans, date from Public
Works Policy era. In Taranaki are large num-
bers of Poles, locally known as “squareheads.”
Writer once taught a school at which were three
English children, ten Poles, three Italians, several
Germans, and a couple of Swedes. Could
manage only by carefully sandwiching nationali-
ties at the seats. Then, as Italians couldn’t speak
Polish or German, and vice versa, the youngsters,
while in school, had to talk English to one
another. Then, of course, there are the Chows,
chiefly on the goldfields. In Wellington, how-
ever, they have practically monopolised the retail
grocery trade. Lastly, in the scows that trade
round Auckland, there are a fair number of Fin-
nish sailors.
“ Ducks ” : lie that story (8.,
8/7/’99) of sailor falling from foretopgal-
lant-yard without much injury. Knew
a man to fall from the spanker-gaff on to
the poop. “ Hello ! ” said the skipper,
“ where the are you from ? ” “ Liver-
pool, sir.” “Well, if that’s been your
average rate of speed, you must have
made a smart passage. Are you hurt ? ”
“No, sir!” “Go to the steward and
get a glass of rum.” The man got his
rum, and went to work again with a look
on him as if having the drink was the only
unusual part of the business.

“ G. 8." : A recent Melb. lecturer
on the Transvaal difficulty said that the
elder Boers regard the younger as degene-
rate “ because they take off their boots
when they go to bed.” Recalls an old-
time squatter who used to go to bed fully
booted and spurred. In a weak moment,
he got married, and, getting drunk at the
incidental festivities, turned into the
nuptial couch with his usual equipment.
Then he dreamt a dream, kicked out
vigorously and lacerated his tender
bride with his spurs. Of course there
were ructions, and, as he used to say, with a
regretful sigh, when telling the story, “From that
time out, sir, I’ve had to wear a Ulanky night-
gown ! ”

The tragedy of a thin Chinaman. At
Hokitika two youths sat in a sportive fashion on a
very thin Chinaman and he died. Medical
evidence was to the effect that “ deceased was
exceedingly thin, had scarcely any fat upon his
body, and were anybody to sit on him violently or
with much pressure the result would probably be
peritonitis.” Died, in fact, through having his
unprotected interior economy sat upon. A trial
for manslaughter is impending, and the West
Coast is only going to sit on stout Chinamen ip
future.
THE CARDINAL CRIME.
STRANGER (in a tone of horrified surprise): “What
was that man oxer there huny for? Did he
kill anybody?”
NATIVE: “Haw.”
S.: “ Stole a horse, perhaps.”
N.: “ Naw.”
S.: “ What did he steal then?"
N.: “A bike!”
“Jonathan”: Be pulling mutton : birds
out of holes. They are also caught at end of
season by stretching great lengths of net along
the beach. The birds make for the water, and
being too fat to fly fall helplessly against the
net. Trenches are sometimes used to intercept
them. Oats (tiger and native) are as much
dreaded by the catchers as are the snakes.


One of the most wonderful inventions of
the age is Willson’s discovery of crystalline carbide
of calcium. There is little doubt that acetylene
gas is about to revolutionise artificial lighting.
As with all successful patents, a host of pirates
have started up to try and rob Willson of his
rights. However, the recent decision of the High
Courts at Leipsic, Germany, will somewhat damp
the ardour of Willson’s opponents. It has been
decided that Willson is undoubtedly the discoverer
of crystalline carbide of calcium. Following up
this success, the English Acetylene Company have
issued a batch of writs against infringers, and the
Acetylene Gas Co. of Australasia Ltd., of 36 Pitt-
street, Sydney—who own the Willson patents for
Australasia —are getting ready to give the Aus-
tralian pirates a surprise. Thisco. ha ve now fitted
up some hundreds of installations around Sydney,
and are prepared to give estimates for any kind of
acetylene installations. Write direct to 36 Pitt-
street, and beware of infringers.*

his tucker, and if the blasted working
man doesn’t like it I’ll kick him off my
dash dash dashed property, and follow
him ten blanky miles with a gun to see
that he doesn’t fire the grass. And if
lie copies back after that I’ll darn well get him
three months hard labor. I’m prepared to do all
that for the working man. There’s nothing mean
about me when once I get started.”

bawling from the back-yard, “ Oh, get the yellow
cow two bloomin’ sticks ! ”

The Union Co.’s s.s. Ohau. which foun-
dered with all hands some weeks ago during a
fierce gale in Cook’s Straits, had 14,145 ft. of
timber loaded on her decks when she left Grey-
mouth on her last voyage. The court of in-
quiry decided that the deck-load was in no
way responsible for ?he Ohau’s disappearance.
Now it would be interesting to hear from some
court which is prepared to say that it is really
better for a vessel to have a deck-load than not—
makes her safer, in fact.
AN ARM-AUXILIARY BIKE MOVEMENT.
What appears to be a noteworthy modifi-
cation in bike-structure is the invention of Mr.
Archibald Forsyth, of Sydney; who, being medi-
cally ordered to cycle for fat-reducing purposes,
and finding that his legs were not equal to pedal-
ling 18£ stone up-hill, had his machine furnished
with a wincli-like contrivance (as seen in accom-
panying picture), which, being geared to the
pedals, allows the arms to take a share in the
propulsion.

Apropos the effect of Mt. Lyell smelter-
fumes, this extract from a paper read recently at
the meeting of Tas. Royal Society. The view is
supposed to be from Mt. Huxley:
The great volume of smoke from the smelters at
Queenstown was seen streaming to the S.W., assuming a
long, narrow band-like form, and stretching, as it
seemed, right through to Heemskirk, where over the
ocean it separated into two distinct arms or canopies
east and west from the main stream. It was a most
peculiar occurrence, and unless I had seen it I could
hardly credit a volume of smoke travelling intact for
such a great distance without dissipation.

difference does it make ? You take a ticket in a 100,000

promptly treated is likely to cause death.
ROM HIS PECULIAR POINT OF VIEW.
“ Norra nosher word, M’ria — you're not beshide
yourshelf. ”
Slab of evidence given in a recent North
Melb. maintenance case by a young woman of 20,
mother of twins : —“ On Oct. 31st of last year
defendant enquired about a waggon which stood
in the right-of-way at her father’s house. The
same night he seduced her. As a result twins
were born on June 29th last. She never saw
defendant before 31st Oct., nor had she seen him
since until this morning.” Doubtful which to
admire most —the casual, negligent way in which
the young Australian female takes up the duties
and responsibilities of motherhood, or the calm
assurance and cool persistency with which that
interesting female identifies a man whom she had
seen once only, three-quarters of a year previously.


DO EXPLANATIONS EXPLAIN? — From the Scriptures.
Here you have an Ancient-Egyptian ex-Attorney-General trying to explain to a small boy the principle of the “screw” (of an Absentee Attorney-General).
“Why, seems to me,” says the small boy, “to quote an historical cablegram, ‘it’s worse’n ever.’”

Mr. Higgins remarked it had been his unpleasant duty to oppose
the bill, because he thought it unworthy of the people of Australia.
There was no organised opposition to the bill at the last referendum, aa
it was thought to be useless. The majority of 15 to lin fhvor of the
measure was not, however, obtained fairly. The poll did nob
express the true sentiment—the unbiassed federal feeling of s's' s'
Victorians. Certain illegitimate -and unfair devices s' / //
were used, to swell the vote in this colony. Had s' sty / / SSJ
the minority in this colony been treated to i s
fair play? He found in the Abo us of the / sSs s
15th of July an announcement that at the
request of the secretary of the Australasian
Federation. league the Premier had de-
cided to issue a gift to those who voted at
the referendum poll on the 27th, of July
in the shape of a memento card prepared
by the Government printer.
What was a gift to those who voted
for the bill would be an insult and a source
of grief and shame to those who voted
against it.

aspirants for stage honours by almost every

formed me that she moved in the first
circles of the populous and thriving town-
ship where she posted her letter, and hear-

talent took the opportunity of applying to.,
ipe. She had sung with great success the ,
garden scene from ‘Faust,’ and had also
learned high-kicking, consequently I would
find her most useful. Ry

PARK ST.,


Tasmanian Assembly lately followed the
example of Maoriland, Victoria, and 8. A. by
passing a measure for the establishment of a State
Land Bank, but the House of Refuse —90 per
cent, of the members are private mortgagees—
emasculated the Bill. And Premier Braddon
reports
It was found fmpraoHoable to assist small landholders
by loans under this Aot, as was intended, because of
oertain radical defeots in the measure which demand
amendment, and without amendment of which it is inex-
pedient to bring the law into operation.
The radioal defects were carefully inserted by the
property-elected Upper House, which is just the
sort of thing that all property-elected Houses of
Refuse exist for.
ArthurRussell, American dentist, 8Bourke-
street E., Melb., makes beautiful teeth or teeth
beautiful, whichever is necessary. Also painless
operations.*
A Maoriland Scot went “hame tae Embra,”
and returned to his province with a full Highland
outfit, costing .£500 in guid M.L. gold. It was
the oomplete accoutrement of a bold Scottish chief,
and all of the ancient time, comprising claymores,
phillabegs, skene - dhus, haggises, cairngorms,
Scots - wha’ - haes, sporrans, bannocks, ghillie-
oallums, and all the other raiment and iron-
mongery with which the warlike Scot adorned
himself when he marched “ ower the Border.”
But the envious Sassenach did not give him a
chance of parading his bravery in his adopted
home they seized it for debt along with his
other effects, and sold it in a brutal 19th century
auction-room for less than a tenth of its value.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems. *

Old at Thirty-fiy©
b Nothing tells of age so
quickly as gray hair. Do you
derive genuine comfort from
looking old before your time ?
If not, then get rid of this
telltale sign of age. Bring back
to your hair all the richness and
color it had when you were in
your early teens. Ayer’s Hair
Vigor will certainly do this for
you.
Thin, Short Hair
If your hair is thin, too
short, or splits at the ends,
it is being starved. Then
why not feed it ? Why not
give it something from
which long, rich, thick, dark hair may
be made? Why not give it the great
hair-food, Ayer’s Hair Vigor? You
will be perfectly satisfied with k, we are sure.
Always Restores Color
You don’t have to wait long. In a couple of weeks the old. color begins to
return, and soon you have again all the rich, dark color of early life. Look
in the mirror today and take a glance at your gray hair. Then use Ayer’s
Hair Vigor for a couple of weeks and look again. You will look ten years
younger. All Druggists and Perfumers.

“ C.E.P.” to The Bulletin from Foots-
cray, Vic. :—
Re your inquiry about Thatcher’s songs, a friend of
mine has shown me a copy, printed in ’65, containing “The
Bullock Creek Picnic,” which your correspondent spoke
of, and describes the incident of the leeches and the dis
may of the ladies thereat. The scene is laid at Loch-
wood, near Bendigo, Vic. My friend does not care to part
with his book, but I have copied a couple of the verses.
There are seven altogether, and the tune is “ Kitty
Jones.”
They ducked and dived and floundered, and fche water
they did dash,
And then, just for amusement, themselves began to
splash.
The bottom was fine gravel, and the water very clear,
And Mrs. G. exclaimed with glee “ Oh, ain’t it stunning,
dear?” B
The gents, as I have said before, sat 'neath some shady
trees,
And as they kept upon the watch, enjoying the cool
breeze ;
But they started up in terror, for they heard a fearful
shriek
Proceeding from the ladies, as they bathed in Bullock
Creek.
Regardless of their dishabille, the spot they soon did
reach,
As one of them from off her leg was trying to pull a
leech ;
There were two upon her shoulder and a whopper on her
calf ;
And the gentlemen maliciously at them began to laugh.
Says Mrs. , “ For shame, you men ; retire again, I
pray.
And you, you nasty auctioneer, just turn your head
away,
And stay beneath the trees there till you hear another
shriek ” ;
And then she adds, “ I wished I’d never bathed in Bul-
lock Creek.”

extremes of N.S.W. politics.
N.S.W. Minister Lee says he gives a shill-
ing a day less for unskilled labor on contract work
in Goulburn district than in Sydney, because the
cost of living is greater in the metropolis. This
seems indirectly rather rough on the great
Foreign-trade theory. Free imports are alleged
to provide cheap food and clothing and other
necessaries. Sydney is the place where the free
imports come to, and, if living is dearer there than
in an inland district—well, why is this thus?
Desperate attempts are being made to
prevent the Commonwealth Bill from
going to the people in W.A. The
Groper landowners know that
three-fourths of the metropolitan
electors and nine-tenths of the
goldfields population are in favor
of immediate union, and so the
present Parliament, which is in
no sense representative, is being
worked for all it is worth to
thwart the aspirations of the ma-
jority. The Premier has turned
a complete somersault, to the dis-
appointment of Federationists,
but he is not the only pebble on
the,beach. Hackett, who “ runs ”
Forrest, is in turn controlled by
his partner, Charles Harper,
acting - Speaker, a highly- re-
spected agriculturist and fruit-
grower. Piesse, the ponderous
Groper who is Commissioner for
Railways, is another fruit-
grower, and openly admits that
his apples have brought
him in £7O and per ton, but,
under Federation, his price would
not exceed <£lo or <£l2. In all
probability Federation would not
make half the difference he im-
agines, but the scare is in. the bones of the
old Groper, who fancies change must mean ruin.
Throssell (Minister for Lands), Lefroy (of the
Mines), and Chief-Secretary Randell,are all big
landowners.
Those N.S. Wales M’sP. who so
worded the Payment of Members Bill that
the salary becomes a refund of expenses,
not wages for specific Parliamentary duties,
meet now their Nemesis when they want
their political letters franked. If the £3OO
a year be a refund, then it covers, or should
Cover, Parliamentary letter services.
Sacredness of majority rule is a cardinal
principle of N.S.W. Labor-party, yet on the
amendment upon the Federal Address (which'
amendment, if carried, would have shelved the
address at the very least), the following “ solids ”
broke away from their leader and voted against the
expressed wish of the 25,000 majority : —Griffith,
Sam Smith, Brown, Holman, Edden, Hughes,
Law. Which should be remembered when next
these statesmen uphold on the hustings the
nobility of the labor-platform.
Noticed : That the Secret Conference
Sydney D.T. now gives prominence to Federal
letters and places anti-Federal letters in obscure
corners.
It. D. Meagher, M.P., seems to make it
his mission in N.S.W. Parliament to follow W. P.
Crick (his former partner) in debate, and “deal it
out ”to him. Such tactics are, to say the least of
it, injudicious, for memories
are certain to be aroused
which the public, no
doubt, have allowed
to slumber. No one
particularly desires
to revive the past, or
makeany man’s pun-
ishment eternal, but,
if Meagher chooses
to revive it every
time Crick speaks in
Parliament, he has
only himself to blame
for the consequences.
In football, a man is
occasionally selected,
not for his play, but
in order to “ lay for ”
a skilful opponent all
day, but it ought not to
be tolerated in politics.
It has long been one
of the loud assertions of
the Sydney foreign-
traders that the increase
in the hands employed in
Vic. factories was mostly
an increase in female em-
ployes, thereby demonstrat-
ing the dry-rot|of Protection.
N.S.W. appears, on the same
principle, to have got the dry-
rot of Freetrade badly. The
number of hands employed in
N.S.W. factories in ’9B (52,518)
was 1079 more than in ’97; and
this increase was made up of 340
males and 739 females.
Bigjohn Forrest’s character as an honest,
if not too-brilliant, politician is getting some-
what blotted over the Federation business. The
latest expose places him in a particularly bad
light. Whilst the members of his Government
and other anti-Federalists were making a great
point of the S.A. Government’s “ ominous
silence ” with regard to, and therefore its pre-
sumed hostility towards, a trans-continental rail-
way through to Fremantle, John himself had in
his possession a letter from the S.A. Premier em-
phatically approving of the project. The matter
became public through a copy of the letter being
laid with other correspondence before S.A. As-
sembly. Forrest’s excuse for this mean decep-
tion was that he intended to use the letter when a
suitable opportunity presented itself. Most folks
would probably consider the “ suitable oppor-
tunity ” to be when everybody was demanding in-
formation about the matter.
IN “PUSH” SOCIETY.
MILKYO: “ Blokes is gettin’ too timid to take any
risks, football ain't what it useter, and steeple-
chases is gettin' quite ’armless nowadays.”
BUTGHERO : “ Give me a good old bike flutter, with
a lot on 'em laid out, and plenty of gore — that’s
wot I calls sport.”
Sydney Telegraph, in that column which
is sometimes signed “Outis” and sometimes
“Niemand,” lately rose up in bitter objurgation
against Old-Age Pensions. And when necessity
arises the paper will doubtless say that it isn’t
responsible for signed articles, just as it did when
its signed column declared that the last Federal
Conference must be held in secret, and then the
rest of the paper called on the people to reject the
Bill because it was a “ Secret Conference Bill.”
Why not have the whole paper signed, and then
nobody would be responsible for anything ?
The largest strike in Westralia up to date
is that of iOOO men employed in the timber in-
dustry at Yarloop. The infamous Truck system is
the trouble —as usual. The men’s case is that,
though their wages are good on paper, they are
compelled to make their purchases from the co.’s
stores at such exorbitant rates that the wages, in
practice, are very low. A proposal to reduce
them, without any corresponding reduction in the
price of stores, brought on the crisis. If Bigjohn
doesn’t put some more velocity and some more
real purpose into his Truck Bill another ten-inch
nail will soon be ready for his coffin.
PORTABLE PROPERTY .
BILL : “ Harry struck a patch marrying that girl .”
JACK : “ Why, has she got money? ”
BILL : “ Well, not exactly cash; but Harry tells me
that she has golden hair, sapphire eyes, ruby
lips, pearly teeth, ivory cheeks, silken lashes,
marble brow, and a silvery voice; so he ought
to get a few bob on her if ever he’s hard-up.”
While it still had a faint hope of stemming
the Federal tide, Sydney D.T. joined in the jibes
and sneers of the anti-Billite party at Premier
Reid’s batch of appointments to N.S.W. Leg.
Council in order to ensure the passage of the
Enabling Bill. Last week it strongly objected to
Jack Want’s strictures on the inclusion of Labor
nonentities in the list, and the difficulty it now
finds itself in must be pleasant reading to the
Premier, who was cute enough to see that these
appointments would some day disturb the
placidity of the Leg. Council and Labor-party
alliance.
Bigjohn Forrest returned from the Pre-
miers’ Conference an enthusiastic Federationist,
but when he found that his colleagues were mostly
hostile, he first cooled and then froze hard. Now
he probably begins to realise that he has wandered
into a very tight place. James’s motion demand-
ing that the Federal .Constitution should be
definitely referred to the people for acceptance or
rejection was defeated by 22 to 14. But the 14
represent more electors now than the 22, arid when
the re-distribution of seats comes along the Fede-
ral party will almost certainly be in a majority.
And yet the anxious John can’t bluff off that re-
distribution much longer.
Murray Smith’s recent sneer at Premier'
Turner’s long list of titles came with an envious
ring from a man who himself bears the somewhat
mangy decoration of C.M.G. Mangy, by reason
of the paltriness and absurd vanity of most of its
Australian wearers. All the same, Turner ex-
hibited the seams and stitches of his slop-built
personality when he waxed so indignant at Smith’s
jeer. His plodding, hard-working, determination
of the past few years, his great talents for admini-
stration, and his constructive abilities, have quite
obscured the fact that Turner rose into politics as
a suburban councillor, and will continue to own
the soul of a suburban councillor to his dying day.
The beastly ignorance of our well-meauing
fellow-man
Perth, Friday.—The fourth meeting of the Joint
Select Committee on the Commonwealth Bill was held to-
day, the press being admitted for the first time. The
committee was chiefly occupied in going through the
Bill, and selecting those clauses for future discussion to
which any member raised objection. The clause relating
to coinage, under whioh no State will be allowed to coin
gold, and which would mean the abolition of the Perth
Mint, was made special reference to.
The Commonwealth Bill says simply : “ A State
shall not coin money,” but that doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that the existing mints at Sydney,
Melbourne, and Perth shall all be broken up. It
probably only means that the Federal Govern-
ment will coin gold at those places. If the fact
that a State can’t coin money means the abolition
of the Perth Mint, then it is already abolished
and always has been. A State can’t coin money
now. The British Government sends out its
officer to coin money in the State, but that is
quite different. The Federal prohibition against
a State coining money is only a repetition of the
law which has been in force all along.
At a recent Brisbane Federation meeting
a man who said he was a carrier wanted to know :
“If all the trade of Brisbane goes South, how do
you expect me to make a living ? ” Answer from
the platform : “If all our trade goes South you
will be kept occupied for a considerable time
carrying it South. And when you have got it
there you will probably have to fetch it all North
again as back-loading."
S.A. Ministerialists are in danger of split-
ting over Household Suffrage. One section opposes
the extreme expedient of a dissolution if the Coun-
cil again blocks the reform, and the compromise
of a .£l5 suffrage is suggested. Premier King-
ston, backed solidly by the Labor-party, de-
clines to listen to the latter idea. Laborites
favor a dissolution, and claim that they can
thereby increase their strength.
Ar,ei-Federation “pome” from Brisbane
Telegraph:—
Say—No Federal powers shall fetter us if you firmly taka
your stand ;
We won’t have Federation here, we want freedom for
Queensland ;
Their promises are savory baits for all those who do not
think:
Into the tempters’ snare don’t fall while still standing on
the brink.
The exhortation in that last line is in the very
finest Telegraphese.
The decision of Victoria’s House of 48
Rich Landlords to no longer oppose the Bill for
placing the Assembly franchise on a one-man-one-
vote basis is the first definite good result of the
democratic Federal Constitution. The 48 Rich
Landlords have rejected that Bill continuously for
seven years or so. But having agreed that Vic-
toria should be bossed by a Federal Parliament
with both Houses elected on a one-man-one-vote
basis, they couldn’t well keep up any longer the
pretence of believing that one-man-one-vote was
“ destructive to the best interests of the country.”
So they changed front with all the grace of a long
crocodile getting hurriedly round a corner.
The left-off politicians of the East come in.
handy to preach anti-Federalism in the West.
Vosper of Queensland, Mint-Sauce Jones of Vic-
toria, Tommy Walker of N.S.W. are three speci-
mens. The East is so dead tired of Jones and
Walker that there isn’t a river from the Tweed
right round to the Glenelg that it wouldn’t be
pleased to see both of them fall into any day.
And the West, which professes to scorn the folks
from t’other side, employs these political wrecks
as the shining lights of local provincialism. If
the W.A. provinoialists can’t raise any brighter
lights of its own than Jones and Walker, it must
be as dim as the horn lantern of bygone days.
Tas. Assembly has decided to perpetuate
itself for six months beyond its term, or as much
of the six months as may elapse before Federation
is fixed up. Members will draw no salaries for
the extra term, but will retain all other Parlia-
mentary privileges, and will not meet to transact,
business unless in case of extreme urgency during
the period of extension. When the first Federal
Parliament is elected Tas. Legislature is to be cut
down by a non - political commission to 32
Assembly members and 16 Leg. Councillors. All
this dislocation of the blessed Constitooshun to
avoid the unpleasantness of having to ask newly-
elected M’sP. to abolish themselves voluntarily.
The N.S.W. Colonists’ Anti-Bill League—
the affair which ran the great anti-Federal agitation
in N.S.W.—has been settling its accounts. One
unfortunate proprietor of a little country paper to
whom ss. was owing received this letter: —
Referring to the account rendered to the Colonists
Anti-Convention Bill League we beg to say that we have-
in hand for distribution a sum which will allow of our
sending you the enclosed cheque for 2s. 6d. in settlement.
If this be not agreeable to you, please return cheque. !
There was 6d. exchange to pay on the cheque (the
league hadn’t even the grace to save the struggling
archimedean lever the loss of 20 per cent, of his
div. by sending stamps in place of the dignified
cheque), so the proprietor got 25., less 2d.', for
posting account. And people wonder why some
country editors Drink !
The complaint of one Naseef Habib, of
Lebanon, and some other brown men from the-
land where the cedars used to grow, that they
were denied letters of naturalisation, raised a dust
lately in S. A, Assembly. . John Downer pleaded
on behalf of Habib and co. on the irrelevant
ground that they came from the land which pro-
duced “ Christ and Homer ” —which was espe-
cially irrelevant seeing that Christ came from the
Jewish land of Judea, and no one knows
what land produced Homer. A Labor-member
promptly suppressed old John by asking if it was
good enough to let in all the tag-rag and bob-tail
of Asia Minor on the off-chance of catching
another Homer. Probably the best compromise
would be to pass an Act that any yellow or brown
or black poet who stirs the soul of S. A. with his
lyre shall be naturalised right off.

The mining boom, which has recommenced since
the Boer scare comparatively died down, has distinctly
benefited the Sydney Safe Deposit. Brokers and buyers
alike see the folly of keeping valuable scrip either in office
safes or private residences, and there have been large
numbers of visitors to view the massive strength of the
Deposit vaults, with a proportionate increase in the
number of clients. We are' requested to state that the
management freely invite a visit. The Deposit is situated

During the week The Bulletin office was
brightened by the arrival of an advance copy of
the twelfth edition of the Australasian United
Steam Navigation Co.’s handbook of information
for 1899-1000. The handbook is liberally starred
with interesting illustrations of the chief cities of
this great country, also some maps, and the 172 | p.
are filled with interesting information that could
only be acquired otherwise by a tremendous lot of
walking and searching. And life is so short that
the handbook saves a lot of valuable time and fits
nicely into the long-felt want since last year’s copy
went astray.*

Yic. Council’s resolve to pass the One-
man-one-vote Bill spoils the favorite gag of a
rather liberal-minded member. Asked at ban-
quets to pass the mustard, &c., &c., he always
replied with dignity : “Sir, we pass nothing in
the Legislative Council ! ”
“At Casino, N.S. W., Rev. Schurr was
presented with a purse of over 100 sovs., subscribed
in small amounts by people of all denominations
in various parts of the district, on his appointment
as Vicar-General of the diocese. In the pioneering
days, the abbe did a great deal to assist the early
settlers.” The present (writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent) represents but a very minute fraction
of the good gold given away by the good abbe to
all classes and creeds during his exile in the Big
Scrub. It won’t be long before the purse-contents
are distributed among the abbe’s poorer parish-
ioners—and stragglers of other denominations and
of no denomination. A truly grand old man,
“ whose house is known to all the vagrant train,”
who shares his scanty meal with the swagman at
the roadside, and who even in his 73rd year has
the energy and heart to travel through the bush
scores of miles at night to attend the sick. The
Abbe, who comes of a distinguished family, is an
Alsatian by birth, and was formerly Frofessor
of Languages at Maynooth Col'ege, and afterwards
at the Catholic University, Dublin.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
What Australian champion-trotter Fritz would
have done under Yankee conditions of track and handling-
will never be known, but there is small doubt he would
have been little, if any, behind the best of them. At
the recent Forbes (N.S.W.) show he covered a mile in
2min. 14sec. Fritz is probably as easy a racing trotter to
drive as ever stood between shafts. He knows no gait but
the trot, and cannot be driven to a break ; the nearest
approach to a break he was ever known to make was in
his maiden race at Kensington (Sydney), when he jumped
over a broad white-wash line which had been marked
across the track. Writer saw Mr. Buckland drive Fritz a
mile in 2.1G holding the reins in one hand and smacking
the wonder on the rump with the other.

A. J.C. people and clubs generally are seeing to
it that Ikey Mo’s existence is not the bed of roses it used
to be. He’s being knocked about from post to pillar and
is compelled to go through a lot of form now ere being
allowed to bet. Laying the odds at pony-meetings or
having the remotest connection with anyone who does,
damns him in the eyes of the N.S.W. governing body.
Latest “infliction”; he must go to office of club and
“sign "or will not have the right to put the bag on.
Further, his clerk must pay a iicensing-fee every year,
and, worst of ail (to some), poor Ikey may not in slightest
degree be associated with a betting-shop under pain of
having his licence cancelled instantly. The two biggest
“shops” in Sydney have determined to keep on. One
belongs to the leviathan of the province, whose voice will
consequently be heard no more at Randwick or other
registered meetings. Shows what gold-mines “shops”
must be. Great weeping and wailing in the camp of the
leather-lunged just now.

Since the days of Carbine, the Melbourne crowd
has never roared so heartily as when Domino came gal-
loping down the straight, at Caulfield, an easy winner of
the £1000 Steeplechase. The performance was not abso-
lutely wonderful—Redleap and Daimio are still ahead of
the Ballarat grey in brilliant records—but it was a fine
achievement by a horse that runs often and seldom fails
to get home. A good animal in the hands of a sportsman
who can afford to be honest is a fine satire on the policy
of what are called “clever” and “patient” owners.
Domino, within 12 months, has won eight races out of 11
attempts. He started his turf career in Aug.,’98, as the
hero of a Hunters’ Steeplechase, after which his owner,
Mr. George Russell, rode him three times over the big
sticks, winning twice and coming to grief the other time.
This was Domino’s only fall up to date. Later, he won a
Steeplechase at the Alelb. Cup meeting, and finished third
tothelightly-weighted Pirate, two days later. At the Aus-
tralian Cup meeting, last March, the genuine goer took two
prizes under very heavy burdens. Then he won the
£1000 steeple at Onkaparinga. Next time he appeared in
public Mysore beat him by half a head for the V.R.C.
Grand National, and last Saturday he gave his backers
another turn by winning the V.A.T.C. National with 13st.
51bs. on his grey old back. Neither Redleap nor Daimio
was raced sill the year round like the sturdy champion
from Ballarat. They were kept for winter coups, whereas
Domino has been picking up stakes and benefacting the
public all the time. A pity that there are no w.f.a.
jumping races for the benefit of boss jumpers. The turf
which a Domino kicks up. with his heels has a sweet
smell, and even Ikey Mo, disbursing the “quids” from a
shrunken bag, feels that for once in a way he is paying
his respects to a real good ’or»e.

All cycling Melb. turned up at Caulfield on
Wednesday to see Gargurevitch, the racing cyclist, start
his career as a jockey. “Gargy” was understood to
have up his sleeve a Tod Sloan invention that would
revolutionise racing, but, after all the talk, he came out
on Wyalla for the Amateur Race with his mount saddled
up in the old familiar style. Used to steeply-banked
tracks and safe corners, “Gargy’’spun round the turns
in a manner indicative of supreme contempt of skidding;
but after getting a lead of 30 lengths at one time he fell
back and finished fifth. It is a point for the white-shirt
brigade of shamateur athletes to chew over, that Gargy,
the professional cyclist, is accepted without question as
a gentleman-jock.

Bendigo (Vic.) Australian Cup, concluded Fri-
day last, was prolific in surprises. The most notable
were the unthought-of Nabeal’s performances. In first
round he put out Czardus, a 7-to-l-on “ certainty,” and
subsequently accounted for bottled-up Kilmainham and
his kennel mate, Dandenong Ranger, both hot favorites
and winners respectively of N.S.W. Waterloo Cup'and
Plate last June. (Two weeks ago a Melb. sporting paper
reported these hounds in the vet.’s hands, and sure ab-
sentees. They didn’t run as if sick, and more money
couldn’t have gone on ’em if they’d been at their best.)
Nabeal went down In deciding course to Gamecock, a
N.S.W.-bred dog by Gameboy from Luoilla.

Expected that Chesney and Kiora will be
shipped for London within the next day or two. Former
was sold for 2000 guineas and an extra 500 first time he
wins. Not a bad bargain for Mr. H. Hawkins, who quite
lately got him for 1100 guineas. Surmised that “ Mr.
Jersey” (Mrs. Langtry) is the buyer. Apropos, Mrs. L.
is playing in luck with Australian nags. There was the
Goodwood double (Stakes and Cup), a week or two back,
won by Merman, and on Tuesday of last week same horse
got away with Birmingham handicap stakes, while, a day
or two before, Uniform appropriated Lewes Handicap
(1000 sovs.), which horses from this section seem to have
a weakness for. Chesney ought to do at least as well as
any of the others—he is strongly put together and sound
as a bell.

Gozo, whoso stock have won .£12,795 during the
year ending July 31, heads the list of winning sires in
Australia, hut he has been closely pressed by Lochiel
(£12,209): the young sire. Bill of Portland, comes third
with £8320 (mainly won by Bohadil); the expatriated
Trenton and Carbine furnish fourth and fifth places with
£7807 and £6654 respectively. Malua closely follows
with £5989. At the end of the half-year (Jan. 31) Gozo
was easily first with £10,327, Lochiel being a bad second
with t 6829. Since then the above figures show that Gozo
has been “marking time," whilst the gallant son of
Prince Charlie has come with a “ Ilieland ” rush.

The sire Glenloth, winner of the sensational
Melb. Cup of *92, was recently sold in Melb. for 65gs. In
that “ swampy ” year two of Mr. Forrester’s—Ronda and

then, with Gaulus and The Grafter, the “squire” of
Warwick Farm has had sweet revenge.

“Kismet” (Brisbane): Difficult to procure in-
formation required without personally interviewing each

can gather is that all 22 are technically gentlemen, and
occupying decent positions.
Australia, our mother 1 ” Four wickets for
435 was the score in the test-match when Tub Bulletin
went to press on Tuesday. Unlucky Darling lost the
toss; and Jackson put up 118, Hayward 137, before their
wickets fell. The other two out were Maclaren 43, and
Ranji 54 ; and with Fry 6i) (not out) a Great Gloom lay
upon the crowd before the Sydney newspaper-offices.

In the Kent match, last week, Bradley and
Burnup were instrumental in the taking of 18 out of 20
Australian wickets. Their averages were Bradley' 8 for
81, and Burnup 8 for 51. Each of them made one catch
off the bowling of Hearne and Mason respectively, also it
happened that Bradley made two catches off Burnup’s
bowling.

caused 10,000 enthusiasts to face heavy rain-squalls,
sloppy ground, and bleak weather. The home team
battled determinedly against a strong wind and blinding
rain in first half. Though the ball was in their territory
almost from the beginning, and in the 25 most of the
time, they stopped the Britishers from scoring. Time after
time Pastor Mullineux’s men came with an avalanche-
like rush, but the Australians braced themselves up and
hurled the opposing side back, while the shivering, shak-
ing mass of lookers-on warmed up and cheered again and
again. Wind and rain with them, it was expected that
the Australians would make a big show in second half,
but hard work through slush and mud had told its tale
on faulty condition, and the Englishmen seemed to play
better than at any time since their arrival. Once or twice
Australia seemed on the verge of scoring, but it was
only a flicker. 20mins. from the kick-off Cookson (Eng.)
secured a smart try, and Adamson converted beautifully :
s—nil. A free to the visitors followed, and Adamson
missed a hard shot at gaol (Gralton got his leg hurt here,
and play stopped 7mins.). Less than 60secs. later Bucher
scored splendidly'. Adamson converted : 10—nil. Boland,
“ off-side,” gave a free to England, but Adamson failed
in hisattempt, though immediately' afterwards he was
successful through a similar offence on GraltoiVs (Q.)
part—right under the bar almost. Full score : England
13, Australia nil. English play all round was exception-
ally good, and condition ditto. Throngs on the hills
loudly hooted referee Corr, without justification, and
crowds in the grand-stand applauded vigorously in re-
sponse. Gralton (Q.) was cautioned for losing his temper
and striking at one of the opposing side. The Aus-
tralians got demoralised towards the end.

Rev. Mr. Mullineux chin-wagged again on
Saturday night at the Sydney farewell banquet to the
British footballers. His latest took the shape of a few
knife-thrusts for pin-pricks suffered. “Deliberate
breaches of the rules ” were laid at Australia’s door—
among others (1) “The trick of holding people back
when they are coming away from the scrum.” (2) “ Two
Australians (in the line-out) forcing an Englishman away
while a third Australian gets through with the ball.”
(3) “ Putting an elbow into a man’s face in the scrum.”
“I am told,” added the leather-chasing parson, “that
the Australian remedy for this is to bite the hand, but we
haven’t yet mastered the art of cannibalism.(4)
“Shouting after an opponent for a pass." “It is the
lowest thing I have ever heard of,” said the rev. gentle-
man—“ it is taking a mean'advantage.” Subdued mut-
terings from all parts of the room punctuated his rever-
ence’s speech, but the tact of chairman Calvert came to
the rescue. “ Gentlemen,” said he, “ Mr. is going to
try and throw a little harmony into the proceedings by
singing a song.’’ The other 21 of the 22 visitors are very
popular, but their skipper never caught on—he has been
in a chronic state of growl right through.

The defeat of Essendon by Colling wood on
Saturday still further solidities the -prospects of Fitzroy,
which has now a clear lead of 7 points over every other
club. Which means that the ’Roys can lose one and draw
one match and yet be ahead, and as they are unlikely to
do either with the matches now in front of them, the
premiership of Vic. Football League seems practically
decided.
• * • •
St. Kilda football club is absolutely the most
consistent Australian athletic institution. It is now
three seasons since it has won a match ; during ’9B and
'99'it has scored a solid loss Saturday after Saturday, and
not even succeeded in drawing once ; last week it reached
the pinnacle of greatness by getting two points against
Geelong! The despised Football Association possesses
teams that could donkey-lick St. Kilda almost as Geelong
did, yet the superiah League declines io admit them to its
ranks on the supposed ground that they are not “class.”
* • * »
The middle-weight boxing-championship of N.S.
Wales is still in abeyance. Sydney police locked up both
Dunn and Conlon, last Wednesday, on a charge of “ being
about to engage in a boxing-match.” Ye gods! what
next? Members of gymnastic clubs, college boys and
others who “ put ’em on ” for trophies are not safe after
this. Dunn and Conlon were to go 20 rounds, and who-
ever had the surplus points then would have got the ver-
dict. Stipendiary Magistrate Isaacs bound them over till
next Quarter-sessions, saying he did so reluctantly ; that
boxing-matches should be stopped altogether or allowed
on proper lines—better course would be for police to
supervise, and step in if a dangerous stage was reached,
etc. When “ Chiddy ” Ryan and Jim Barron were, three
years ago, before the same magistrate, .on a similar
charge, he told the police that limited-round boxing-
contests were not illegal provided no stake was in
evidence and gloves were regulation size (8oz.). Autho-
rity was quoted in support; yet now an opposite view,
and with reluctance ! Why? Worth mentioning in this
connection that the 10-round boxing-match between
Lenton and Casey, at Golden Gate Club (Sydney), on
Saturday night, came off undisturbed, and drew 500
spectators.

The heralded champion middleweight pug. of
Australia, Tim Murphy, reached Sydney from Tasmania
on Friday, and is simply spoilin’ for a fight. Tim’s latest
victim was Albury Clifford who (just returned from a
trip ’Ome with all the veneer of the old country upon
him) went under in 3J4 rounds. Murphy is a brother of
that mass of whipcord and wire “ Torpedo” Billy, whom
he resembles much in face and build, though a deal
taller. Writer recolleots “Tim ” playing Rugby for Vic-
toria against N.S.W., four or five years since ; also, heard
of Jim Quigley (since dead) saying then, after a trial
bout: “ That cove (Murphy) ’ll be a champion ’fore long.”
Quigley was a good prophet.
* * * *
In two rounds plump and plucky Fred Preston,
of Melb., succeeded in finishing off Joe Cullen, the Vic.
pug. who returned from England a few weeks back with
upturned pants and a curled stick on his arm. The fight
was willing and pretty while it lasted, but towards the
end of the second round Preston swept a left swing on
Cullen’s jaw that sent him down for considerably more
than his lOsec.
♦ * * *
Cabled that London Sportsman, referring to
Australian champion swimmer Lane’s easy victory in the
furlong championship hi England, remarked that he was
“ one of the best swimmers who have ever visited Eng-
land.” What lovely rot to send all the way out here, and
what a beautiful compliment! “ One of the best! ” Isn’t
Lane actually the best swimmer England ever saw
(visitor or otherwise) over the distance ? Didn’t he put
up a world’s record here, and repeat the performance
“ down under ” with Isyds. of a margin between himself
and next man (Lister), u'hoin Derbyshire, the previous
holder, couldn’t give two yards to ?
(Continued on page SI.)
Mr. E. 0. Westlake, sub-editor of the
Australian Stab, whose hopeless illness was
chronicled in last week’s Bulletin, died before
this paper came out. He was one of the most
popular and capable of his craft, and had, before
joining the Star, ably served in turn Argus,
Age, and Sydney Daily Telegraph.
One of the crew of the Edina put the re-
cent disaster in a decidedly warning light when he
said: —No rule is observed between the Edina
and the Excelsior as to the side on which each
should pass in going to Geelong and returning.
We pass the Excelsior one day._on our starboard
side, and the next on our port side.” Under this
happy-go-lucky system there was bound to come
another day when the two boats didn't pass at all.
John Haynes’s crusade against the Federal
Bill received a shock on thedivision on his amend-
ment on the Address. Exactly 100 members were
accounted for when N.S.W. Assembly divided,
and but 23 voted with him; Crick and Lyne being
the only persons of any note on the side of the
ayes. Of the 25 absentees 20 at least would have
voted against the amendment, the only absolutely
certain “aye” being John Norton.
Tucker, who has a second time beaten the
O’Malley for a S.A. Assembly seat, could not
carry out all his campaigning owing to his father’s
death ; but in a land where sympathetic woman
votes, misfortune of that sort is likely to injure
the other candidate—as it is said to have done in
this case. Tucker, sen., was a young sea-dog
who reached the province in its flrst year, and
was aftervvards one of the party who made the
first soundings in the Port Adelaide “ river ” —as
the awful entrance to the “ harbor” is miscalled.
“Miles”; Authoritatively rumored that
the changes Premier Reid referred to in replying
to Parliamentary questions re Col. Bayly are that
Bayly is to be reduced to the rank of Major and
Deputy-Assistant-Adjutant-General, the present
D.A.A.G., Major Boam, taking Bayly’s position
as Colonel Commanding the purely Volunteer
N.S.W. Forces. Major Boam is one of the heavy
“ paper - warriors ” of Victoria Barracks, and
putting so affable a personage into Bayly’s position
practically means making the Volunteer Com-
mandants, who have made all the trouble, their
own bosses. With all his faults, Col. Bayly is
a good deal of a “soldier,” and he loses his billet
through trying to make soldiers of an absolutely
undisciplined collection of “influential” toy-
warriors. Oh, for Federation and a strong, re-
lentless officer as Commander-in-Chief !
Talk about the feuds of the Capulets and
Montagues and of the fine, healthy hatreds
between the gintlemen of Tipperary and Ulster ;
they are sweet friendships compared to the eternal
Norton - Black - Meagher vendetta. At the
squalid Open-letter case at Darlinghurst Court,
Sydney, it was a sight for the gods to see
Meagher sitting cheek-by-jowl with Norton.
Whenever an idea would strike “ the brilliant
young Australian ” he would lean over and ap-
parently pass some remark to counsel for accused,
and every time some hideous allegation would
crash down on the battered character of Norton
he (the brilliant) would smile, put his hands
together gleefully, and glance at the back of the
head Norton had turned to him. Further along
the delighted face of George Black was bent down
over a huge,pocket-book, while at the end of the
row Crick leaned his rippling and expressive
countenance against his hand. And Norton—he
sat with his brown coat-collar turned up and a
shivery look in his peepy eyes, sometimes trying
to affect an air of nonchalance, sometimes
feverishly taking notes and then jerkily
handing them to the Crown counsel. There
is a. whole, stack of inorals protruding from
this indescribably smellful case. One of them
is that there is a sort of journalist who
should never mouth the word “concupiscence”
about a political enemy until he (the journalist) is
94 years old and has allowed the public to
utterly forget his own personal adventures, as re-
lated by himself in the witness-box.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS ol
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
“ Stoker ” : No need to go" West for danc-
ing undertakers (B. 29/7/’99). In a Vie. town,
the local “planter” attends all the “hops” he
can, and was recently elected on a “ social ” com-
mittee, in place of another Terpsichorean, whom
he had buried. Being a single man, and well-in
also, “Coffins”' has no difficulty in getting girls
to dance with him'. The local paper’s report of a
recent shivoo mentioned that Miss So-and-so had
been taken in to supper by Mr. Hearse, and in
next column was an announcement to the effect
that Hearse, undertaker and embalmer, will be
pleased to wait on families for orders. Yes,
pleased ! ”
It had been raining a week as it only rains
in Maoriland, and the children had great hopes
that the teacher would quail at the sight of the
ocean of slush and mud that lay between her and
the school. The fact that smoke was issuing from
the ehimney did not make them very hopeful,
though. The first boy was about to walk in when
he suddenly sprang backwards with an exclama-
tion of something like terror, and a dire whisper
of “ Inspector ! ” They executed a sudden move-
ment to the back of the wood-heap and held a
council of war. Bill said he didn’t b’leeve there
was any inspector about ’cos there was no sign of
his buggy. Mary said he wasn’t there ’cos it Was
only three months since ’zamination. The first
boy said it must be him ’cos no other man would
be sitti.n’ in front of the fire as though the place
belonged ter him. He then described the in-
spector as a little man in brown knickerbockers.
That settled his yarn, for the district inspector
was a long, thin man with a bald head and dense
crop of whiskers. It began to rain again, and the
children gathered up their courage in both hands
and marched into the school. There was a little
man in brown knickerbocker suit sitting in front
of the fire and he turned round and greeted them
with a pleasant smile. Whereupon the children
gasped, for it was the lady teacher in “rational ”
costume. That night the parents listened, dumb
with astonishment, to the news that Miss Smith
was wearing boy’s clothes. The rumor spread
like wildfire and a committee meeting was hastily
summoned to deal with the matter. At the
meeting committeeman M'Kenzie, who attended
in kilts, said “it Was nae decent o’ tha
lassie tae gang aboot in such on - Christian
style o’ dress.” “ What about yerself?’” sneered
a cynical Southerner pointing to M'Kenzib’s huge
; hairy leg which Sandy, had placed on the table
while lie was speaking. M'Kenzie took it the
wrong way. He thought his “ freen’ ” was under
the impression that the lady was wearing kilts,
and he threw oil on the smouldering fire by ex-
plaining that “ tha’lassie ’’ was not showing her
knees in kilts—good Skawtch kilts—but going
about wi’ them covered right up in “ eenfernal
breeches—short clothes like the callants wore.”
After much argument and angry discussion, the
skirt-party won by four votes, and it was decided
to inform Miss Smith by letter that she must be
decently attired in future. The committeman
who acted as secretary was a progressive, and he
refused to write to the lady on the subject ; he re-
fused to dictate to any woman what she should
wear as long as she was decently and sensibly clad
and caused no scandal. Also, he refused to lend
his fountain-pen to M'Kenzie (in kilts) to write
the letter with. M'Kenzie declared he would
make him lend the pen, and it started. ‘ It was an‘
awful battle, but stodgy, hide-bound conservatism
triumphed by sheer force of numbers, and carried
the night. Since then the teacher boards with a
progressive family, and in wet weather the school
is closed, as the lady has to wear a skirt over her
bloomers, and skirts are so awkward going through
the bush in wet weather.

How names eventuate. A “ Scawtch ”
friend of mine (writes a Bulletin correspondent)
went home from Borneo and married, and shortly
after his return the wife presented him with twin
girls. “Call them Jean and Flora,” said Jock,
but Flora the elder demurred, and wanted ’em
christened with “ real native names.” “All
right; call ’em Miriam and Leila,” said Jock,
jock-ularly, and went away up-country, Mean-
time, an itinerant sky-pilot happened along, and
the twins were “called” accordingly, but when,
on Jock’s return, he was told of this, he broke out:
“ Flora, Flora ! ye dinna ken what ye hae doon !
The bairnies are ca’ed ‘ biggun ’ and ‘ littlegun ”
and thefe's nae way oot o’ it ! ”

Mr. C. J. A. NIELSEN.
A Living Witness oi the virtues of the
Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.
Parliament House, Sydney.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Aifaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —Having suffered for some time from a com
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, ana their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the oenefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

Liver and Kidney Pills, I have pleasure in stating that
they have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-
though previous to trying them I had I t ied three different
doctors without effect. For the benefit of those who may
be suffering in a similar manner, and as a proof of my
gratitude, you are perfectly at liberty to publish this short

I, TIIOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-

hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the NERVES, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried
several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rass-
mussen’s Purely Herbal ALFALINE VITALITY PILLS,
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare COM-
PLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and although
this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.

this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true.

“ Dear Sir,—l enclose for your own private perusal
portion of a letter received from my mother, Mrs. ,
of London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God-send to a martyr to
colds and bronchial asthma. Ido not wish any names to

portion of this letter you choose, anil you can confidently
refer anybody to me.
“ I heard of your excellent remedy, and sent it to Eng-

it was.—Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above :
“Yon will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure really excellent. 1 was very bad when it
arrived, and 1 immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
much interested in it. He came yesterday, and carried
off the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a ehemist who is in a large way here.”

I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. ’ I had medical
advice, and tried other ‘ remedies,’ without, avail. I tried
yottrs, ftnd never had a fit of couching after taking the
first dose, and though I have had hut Iwo bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the couch has vanished. You

Neighbor Wolff and Others.
Almost every afternoon in pleasant weather I see
my neighbor Wolff sitting in an easy-chair in the
shade in front of his own door. Sometimes he
kills time by reading the paper, but oftener he
does nothing but watch the people and the vehicles
that pass. I frequently stop and talk with him a
few minutes, and he appears to be grateful for the
trifling attention. He is a man of about fifty,
strongly and sturdily built, and to look at him you
see no reason why he should not be up and about
as actively as the best of us. He is intelligent and
well-informed, has travelled considerably, and is a
man in every way worth knowing. His ideas on
finance and business seem to be clear and practi-
cal, and it strikes a stranger as odd he does not
grapple with his opportunities and pile up a big
fortune. Yet he never makes a motion in that
direction. He lets the chances all slip by, and
just sits there as though the world were no more
to him than the Klondyke goldfields are to the
resident population of a cemetery. Yet my neigh-
bour Wolff knows what money is, and appreciates
what can be done with it. Then why doesn’t he
“get a move on” as the Yankees say, and make
hay while the sun shines ? Take a peep at him
about nine o’clock at night, when he takes his cus-
tomary exercise on the pavement —the way being
mostly clear of pedestrians by then—and you will
need no verbal answer to the question. Stocky and
strong as he appears when in his chair, he makes a
poor show on his legs. Slowly, heavily, leaning
hard on his thick stick, he goes to and fro a few
times between the corner and his house—a dis-
tance of 200 feet may be—and then with a sigh
sinks again into his chair like a man who realises
he is out of the race.' A paralytic stroke two
years ago, and the constant fear of another —that
explains it. He is one of the multitude who are
in the world and not of it— as this woman was a
while since:—
“Erom my girlhood,” she says, “I way always
oppressed and hindered by weakness; I was
habitually tired, weary, and languid. Like all
such persons, I lived a kind of life to myself. All
pleasures or pursuits which called for energy and
vitality were closed to me. I had a feeble and
fitful appetite, and what I ate gave me great pain
at the chest and back, and a sense of coldness,
deadness, and weight at the stomach. At times
there would be also a gnawing, sinking feeling.
“ As I grew older I was much troubled with
palpitation of the heart and loss of sleep. Year
after year I dragged along in this miserable way,
and, being too weak to walk, was drawn from
place to place in a bath chair. Every effort was
made to obtain a cure. I consulted doctor after
doctor, and took many kinds of medicine and
treatment, but got no more than temporary relief.
One doctor said my heart was diseased.
“My sister urged me to try Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. Without any great hopes of its effect
in my case, I nevertheless procured a bottle
from the Stores in High-street, and began to
take it as directed. The result was a decidedly
improved appetite, and I relished and digested
what I ate without any pain or distress following.
As I continued to use this medicine the heart
trouble was less frequent and finally ceased alto-
gether. My nerves soon became stronger, and I
could sleep well. In a few weeks more I was
belter and stronger than ever before in my life , and
have enjoyed good health ever since. My friends
were almost as much surprised and pleased as I
was at this remarkable result of taking Mother
Seigel’s Syrup, and you may make my statement
public if you think it will do good.”—(Signed)
(Mrs.) Mary Ann Welch, 1 Constitution Hill,
Luton, Chatham, February 6, 1895.
My neighbor Wolff may or may not recover
from his paralysis, but all cases like Mrs. Welch’s
—indigestion, with consequent weakness and ner-
vous debility—should be curable by the remedy
which cured her. It opens and renews the diges-
tion, which is the fountain of life, and puts a
wholly new aspect on the world around us. From
having been laid aside as cumberers of the ground,
we become once more workers with others and
sharers of their pleasures.

“Clean Out of Tone.
CLEMENTS TONIC,
The Final Resource,
PROVES
Thoroughly Effective.
The Case of a
Distinguished Journalist.
(BY OCR SPECIAL REPORTER.)
** It is a splendid remedy—none to equal
it,” were the words that greeted our
reporter’s ears, as he was quietly taking his
mid-day meal in the Caf6 Esclienhagen, in
Brisbane. “Yes,” continued the voice at
the next table, “he was just a mere shadow
when I left him in Melbourne, and I
thought him a goner sure, and I was never
more surprised in my life when, a month or
so afterwards, I again met him in Sydney.
He then presented as fine a figure of an
athletic, well set-up man as you would find
in the City.”
Shortly afterwards the pressman, who
heard the above conversation, knocked at
the door of The Pines, Sexton Street.
Brisbane. On presenting a newspaper
man’s magic card, he obtained immediat ■
admission to the private study of Mr.
Graham Wilson. That busy journalist am :
litterateur was immersed in work.
“With your consent I should like to
interview you at once,” began our reporter,
taking out his note-book.
“That altogether depends upon win l
subject,” answered Mr. Wilson.
“I heard you had been seriously ill, and—
“Oh, if that’s the subject of your
questions I’m sure I shall be only too glad
to answer them. In fact, I am alwaA s
talking about my illness, or, rather, abo ‘
my wonderful recovery. ”
You are pretty well known as
journalist ? ” queried our reporter.
“Fairly well known,” said Mr. Wilsoi .
leaning back comfortably in his arm ahaii.
‘ln Sydney I have been on the Sydney
Morning Herald , Daily Telegraph , Sunday
Times, Truth, Evening News, and the Town
and Country Journal, and in Melbourne on
The World, and the Federal Australian.
besides editing The Singleton Argus, 2'he.
South Qippsland Chronicle, The Bendigo
Evening News, The NarrabriAgt, TheMolornj
Express, and The Mudgee Independent—a
pretty fair list, I opine. ”
“ I should think so—a record list,” replied
our reporter. “.And now, Mr. Wilson, for
some particulars of your ill health.”
“I first of all went clean out of tone.
That was when I was in Melbourne.
Of course I know why—it was the strain
of my Parliamentary and other work
and engagements, involving too much
night work. All these made me weak,
and predisposed me to the attack of
pleurisy with effusion, which swept upon
me like an avalanche. You know if you
are out of tone, and your nerves all wrong,
you are merely inviting disease, and you’ll
generally find some malady will accept the
invitation. If when I first began to go
wrong I had taken some proper remedy,
my system would, perhaps, have been able
to resist that terribly weakening pleurisy.
In the end I was laid up, and for a time
was in considerable danger. An operation
was performed. My life trembled in the
balance. However, after a long illness I
seemed to have passed the worst stage of
the complaint, and the pleurisy gradually
disappeared. But, unfortunately, that
disease left behind something worse than
itself—a most distressing weakness. Every
morning I found myself with a dull, aching
head, and it required a most strenuous
effort on my part to crawl out of bed, and
to dress. My breakfast I never could
touch. To sit down to this meal was a
mere farce. Of course I would try to eat,
but after a mouthful or two I was forced to
put down my knife and fork, and give the
matter up as a bad job. In the morning,
and indeed during the whole of the day,
there was a nauseous and bitter taste in my
mouth, which nothing would rid me of.
The consequence was that even when sheer
starvation had made me slightly hungry,
I could not enjoy my food, for it all seemed
to have the same bitter flavour. It was
as much as I could do to walk ; I never had
such a sensation before. In fact, I was
always tired. My limbs ached, my back
ached, my head ached, and my eye balls
ached, till I felt like one great ache all
over. At last I made a startling discovery.”
“Yes,” exclaimed the reporter, deeply
interested.
“I found out,” continued Mr. Wilson,
“ that instead of improving I was gradually
losing flesh every day. This I ascertained
by weighing myself. Like any other man
under the same circumstances 1 became
frightened. I immediately changed my
physician.”
“You did employ doctors at this time 1”
interjeoted the other.
“Oh, yes, of course, many doctors.
Well, as I was saying, I sent for another
doctor at once—a great expert too.”
“ What did he say ? ”
“He said,” replied Mr. Wilson, “that
my whole system was out of order, nerves
and all, and that only patience and great
care and the best nourishment could pull me
through. And it was quite true. I had
indeed fallen into a shockingly nervous state.
Sleep had forsaken me, and I began to think
I should never close my eyelids again in
healthy slumber. If you had entered my
bedroom at any hour at night at this period
of my illness, you would have seen my
restless and never ceasing turning in bed,
trying in vain to get to sleep. I was
slowly wasting away day by day. Not the
attentions and treatment of all my medical
uen could arrest my decline, nor could all
their medicines, nor all the other advertised
cure-alls that I foolishly used, do me one
atom of good. A deep despondency seiw»'
me. Then something happened.”
“ And that was ? ” asked our reports.
“The advent of a bottle of Clements
i onic into my bedroom. How it got there
L was at the time too ill to even ask, but
[ only remember my attendants gave me a
few doses. I afterwards heard they looked
upon it as a final resource. Even after this
small quantity of the remedy I instinctively
felt I was improving. But the first tangible
signs of improvement appeared in a day or
so after this. I found that I was more
■heerful in the day time, and slept at night.
Then, in another day or two, I began to eat
again ; just a lreile, it is true, but that little
with appetite, and my food did me good, for
it now caused me uo pain or inconvenience
whatever. After this my recovery was a
steady progression. I never failed to take
my dose of Clements Tonic at the proper
hour. Talk about eating 1 I can tell you it
did make me eat; but then,” said Mr.
Wilson, with a smile, “ 1 had a lot of lost
ground to make up. In two months, to
cut the story short, I was as well, if not
better, than I had been for years, and
stouter and heavier than I had ever been
before during my whole life.”
“This will appear in our paper, Mr.
Wilson.”
“Of course, I know that; you seem to
forget I have interviewed many people
myself, and you may be sure I shouldn’t
have granted this interview just to gratify
one man’s curiosity,” returned Mr. Wilson,
with some show of irritation at the
reporter’s interposition.
“ The fact is,” he continued, “ I should
like more of the public to know about the
value of Clements Tonic, and in doing this
I feel I am to some extent a public bene-
factor. Of course, as a newspaper man, I
have had a wide experience of a great many
so called remedies, and their various tricks
and devices, and I know most of them to be
utterly worthless and mere catch-penny
advertising dodges, and you may be sure if
I didn’t know Clements Tonic to be a first-
class therapeutic preparation of proved
value, as well amongst the general public
as amongst large numbers of the leading
medical men of Australia, I wouldn t for
one moment allow my name to be connected
with that remedy. I may tell you that 1
consulted a doctor, a friend of mine, con-
cerning my recovery, and he told me ui
confidence that he was not at all surprised,
and that he had known Clements Tome
work quite marvellous cures in other cases
quite as far gone as mine.”

Dr. CLARKSON’S
A Concentrated, VITALISING, NERVE, BRAIN,
MUSCLE, and BLOOD STIMULANT: a remedy
known to Dr. Clarkson only. As a Tome for the NERVES
it is unequalled. It is the most powerful of all BLOOD
STIMULANTS and Muscle Developers.
READ THESE EACTS.-Its action in recuperating
the exhausted substance of the brain-cells is simply eleo-
trical. The REINVIGORATOR is as necessary m bram-
work as sleep is to our existence. The brain-cells of per-
sons who have died during periods of great exhaustion
from over-exertion are found to be considerably changed
from the condition of the normal oell during health and
VI WATER ON THE BRAIN.—The cell of the ex-
hausted brain, instead of being plump and full of nervous
matter, is vacuolated, a cavity within its substance having
formed and being filled with water. This means that a
part of the cell substance has been oonsumed daring the
time of brain-activity.
DR. CLARKSON’S REINVIGORATOR, by its action
on the circulation of the Blood, replenishes all this wasted
substance. You can no more hope to go on working
successfully without this REINVIGORATOR than a loco-
motive can steam on indefinitely without fresh supplies
of fuel.
POPULAR FALLACY.—PeopIe ran away with the
idea that exercise recuperates the brain. This is a mis-
take. While exercise may rest the mentally-overworked
part it exhausts other portions of the brain and leads to
utter fatigue. No exercise can take the plaoe of this
REINVIGORATOR.

“Fact”: Popular priest up North lately
blessed two R.O. pugs before they stepped into the

Southern devotees of pugdom include an
elderly dame, an old-established high-priestess of Venus.
Never a fight passes without her taking her place among
the five-shilling contingent, wearing full male oostume,
and making a very convincing and not at all attractive
man of short stature. During any willing contest the
lady’s face is a study. Each hit sees her jaws gnp, her
teeth shine through her parted lips, and her shoulde s
jerk forward convulsively. Which recalls the fact that
a well-known Melb. boxing-hall of a few years back had a
gallery lighted during the day by a window opening on a
bar. On nights of action the bar did nothing, and the
whole of the Hebes would cluster round the window and
see the game out.
There is a lady owner who graces unregistered

rumored that she has appeared booted, breeched, and

down her nags, leads them on to the course, and, if they
plav up, she deals it out to them with an extremely heavy
and dirty right. She drives to and from the course in a
racing jinker, one leg on each side of the horse—ahvays a
good beast—wields a vigorous whip, and is boss of the

One peculiarity about N.S.W. pug. Mick
Doolev was that, after a series of unparalleled de-
feats,' he could find backers and barrackers. In
the early eighties Dooley proved himself, in old
raw-meat style, a glutton for punishment. But in
crowded gas-lit halls he has always exhibited a ner-
vousness like that of stage novices. Several of Dooley s
defeats were more creditable tban many champions
victories. _ *
A successful Melb. pug., reckoned a champion
in his class, had an experience the other day which will
impress upon him the necessity of carrying with him a
ring, a referee, three seconds, a gong, and a 10-sec.
check. He forgot these, and taking a seat on a 8.
Melb. tram, airily instructed the conductor to go to the
devil when the fare was demanded. A threat that he
would be put off the car impelled the bruiser to remark
that ten of the conductor’s sort weren't equal to the job ;
when suddenly there was a wild whirl, and he was well
and truly punched seven times in quick succession. In
vain he appealed to the sky for fouls during clinches. The
conductor didn’t bother about Queensberry rules. He
simply slogged the pug. till all was blue, and when his
arms tired, he handed him over to the nearest policeman.
Next day the injured stousher was fined a fiver for
“ language,” and the court expressed its sorrow that the
untimely arrival of a constable had prevented the
talented young bruiseiGrom being killed.

Public interest in Melbourne has been greatly
stimulated by thrilling details lately published of
the great jam-tart competition between two boys,
when the winner ate 32 against his rival’s 25 in 32)4
minutes, and carried off the silver belt and medal. Since
the prominence given to this contest, arrangements are
in contemplation for a meeting on a large scale, where
prizes will be offered for the largest consumer of soup,
meat, and vegetables. A leading member of society has
been invited to preside, and competitors may be assured
that everything will be done on the square not as was
done in a notable case up-country. Sporting men will
remember the event, when three competitors devoured
a snake, a dead cat, and a paper pie, but, after per-
forming these athletic feats, found that the promoter had.
bolted with the gate-money, and that they were held
individually and collectively responsible for the hire of
the hall.

The recent revelation of preserved-fruit poison-
ing at the Inns of Court Hotel, London, suggests a
humorous fate that might have befallen the Australian
Eleven. It happened that the Australians were away from
their hotel when the tinned fruit came along,
and inasmuch as twenty visitors were seized with
an injured feeling, and two of them actually died,
the cause of the trouble was promptly traced.
Now, supposing the Australians had eaten just
enough of that fruit to put them slightly out of sorts for
an indefinite period, and make their loss of “ form seem
quite natural, we should have had the ’Orae papers
rejoicing in the thought that “ English cricket has at last
re-asserted itself,” etc., whilst the despondent wiseacres
at this end were writing columns of nonsense to the effect
that the “overworked ” team had “ gone stale all round.
* *A * *
It is astounding that even the most biassed
cricket scribe can speak one minute of the “ terrible
strain ” imposed upon the Australians (every one of
whom has been rested during the season), and next
minute mention that Ranji and others have scored more
runs and the principal English bowlers nave bowled more
balls than any member of the Australian team. Figures
show that the visitors get thrpugh less-w6rk in a season
than the men who play for All-England, as The Bulletin
has many a time pointed out.

“Tuthersider” writes to The Bulletin from
Kalo-oorlie, asking “ Which isthebetterall-roundcricketer,
Laver or Jones?” Well, the long Victorran is “all
round,” but not brilliant, whereas Jones is brilliant, but
can’t be called “all round,” unless the term batsman is
understood to mean merely a man who hits at the ball
Solemn authorities on first-class cricket will admit Laver
to be a respectable batsman, bowler arid field. Jones, in
’ their way of speaking, is not a batsman. Yet, if the two
men were judged on points—from 0 to 20 points in each
■ department of the game—Jones, perhaps, would get the
bigger total to has,credit.- . ' - . .’i

Some performances by C. J. Thornton, late: of
Middlesex Oourity tfeam 170 runs in lOOtnin. 1M in
38min.; 107 (8 sixes) in 29 hits (A. G. Steel being one of
, the bowlers) ; 188 out of 216 in 2 hours (including 13
sixes); nine balls arid 34 runs (7,fours, 1 six); 20 off a
4-ball over ; 190 in an hour and a-haif; four different balls
used in one over,-because the first three went over the
fence. Some of the above matches, were not first-class,
but’tis a “ sweet record.” Thornton has to his credit
these properly measured and authenticated big hits,
.measuring to pitch,of ball; 162yds. at Brighton (Eng.),
152yds. at Orleans Club (Eng.), 150yds. at Colombo

The London newspapers’ filst estimates of the
Australian Eleven were borne out by results. This
team, compared with previous Australian shipments, is
• stronger in batting than in bowling; it has suffered no
occasional absurd collapses, as Trott and co, did" three
years back; but it has had its bowling collared several
times, particularly wheri Jones was standing down; Only
three “ centuries ” were scored against TrotFs last crowd,
whereas some dpzen have happened this season up to
-time of writing. • ■■

Middlesex, the county that includes a big !
portion of London, hasn’t produced many good cricketers
of late years. The present county team is.a very mixed
lot-. Albert Trott and Roche learned ail their cricket in-
their native Australia. Another “ Middlesex ” man came
from the West Indies, another from Scotland, and two
others from Bucks and York-hire which latter county
sets a good sporting example by playing none but bonA

There is in Australia an hotel where rheumatic patients
congregate. Whenever a whale has been taken, tne
patients are conveyed to the works in which the animal

At South Melbourne (Vic.) police-court
a “ very ladylike woman ” was lately fined 2s. 6d.
for hanging on to a public-house door with both
hands and calling to her husband— who was wast-
ing his substance in the beer-pewter that biteth
like a serpent and stingeth like an adder to
“ come home.” She pleaded that the family was
reduced to great straits the house-father
painting his nose with the price of their daily

to return to the bosom of his family. The Bench
which fined her was described as “ sympathetic,
too. The husband wasn’t fined, yet a man who
leads to such painful scenes by letting his wife
know where he gets his beer should be severely
punished.


At this point a man came in with the defunot

looked at each other and then at the patient.

SOUND JUDGMENT.
Sound judgment teaches us that a debilitated system cannot be built up by
continued purging, which reduces the strength of a body already weakened
by disease. Most so-called blood builders are purgatives.
-D r Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People do not act on the bowels.
1 hey build up the blood and strengthen the nerves.
The same sound judgment that leads you to give Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
ror Pale People a trial will prompt you to refuse any substitute an unscrupulous
dealer offers. _ Anyone who says he has “something just as good,” or “the
same except in name,” is dishonest, and does not deserve your trade
Here is the result of two cases in which the real Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
were used.
CONSUMPTION AND LUNQ TROUBLES CONQUERED.
Mr. Thomas is the manager of a leading general store in Queanbeyan, and a reporter, calling upon him
recently, found that he had been completely cured of consumption and serious lung affections of long standing
°y ~ r * Williams’ Pink Pills. Mr. Thomas was attended by a leading physician, who treated him with all the
skill and attention that was possible, but notwithstanding his treatment the patient did not appear to improve,
tiis medico described the ailment as consumption, and Mr. Thomas was naturally in despair. He was troubled
with a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, pains in the chest and sometimes in the shoulders. He had also
a tendency to feverish attacks, and was naturally greatly debilitated by his ailment. In fact, his loss of flesh
and strength was noticeable to all his acquaintances. Other symptoms later on asserted themselves, and
Mr. Thomas would wake up at night literally g vsping for breath. Mr. Thomas’ physician also told him that
P?« 89n ce of asthma, and this naturally made his patient more concerned than ever. The respon
a* i le ? Ebusiness unfortunately aided the disease in its progress, for Mr. Thomas was always a busy man.
At last he heard of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills through reading the newspapers, and was also recommended to try
a gentleman who had himself been cured by them. In September, ’97, he commenced taking them,
and after the first few boxes he felt considerably relieved. Buoyed up with hope he persevered, and improved-
by week, until he had used the contents of eight boxes. At this stage he found himself completely cured
<>f consumption, asthma, and, indeed, of all weakness in his lungs. He became healthier-looking and more
robust, and new strength and activity came to his body. Instead of being depressed and despondent, his spirits
became buoyant and hopeful—a wonderful change to his former condition. Mr. Thomas, in parting with our
representative, said : “lam most thankful to Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for having oared me, and I shall always
heartily to my friends.”
RHEUMATISM AND SCIATICA VANQUISHED.
(Blayney Advocate and Carcoar Herald.)
A marvellous cure of rheumatism and sciatica having been reported in the town, a reporter from the
Blayney Advocate and Carcoar Herald was despatched to obtain some details of ,the illness and cure of Mrs
Layland, wife of Mr. John Layland, a Well-kuown and highly-respected resident of Blayney, N.S. W., who is
the engineer of the railway pump-house. Mrs. Layland readily consented to give the required information,
md spoke with great enthusiasm in praise of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. “For fourteen years,” said she, “I
suffered excruciating pains from rheumatism in the arm—so that I could not raise my hand to my head. It
affected my arms from the shoulders to the finger-euds;
my hands were swelled up, and I couldn’t move my fingers.
I also had sciatica in the left, leg and couldn’t walk about.
The illness affected me more in the winter time. A doctor was
attending me all the while, and although he was very attentive to
me, his medicines only gave me temporary relief. I also tried
Eucalyptus and patent medicines, but got no benefit from any.
I was never entirely free from pain, and I got that way that I
did not care what happened to me. About eighteen months ago,
a lady friend, who used to come and help me to do my housework,
recommended me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. At first, I
refused to give them a trial, as I had spent such a lot of money
in taking medicines without deriving any benefit. But my friend
persuaded me to take them, and thankful I am of it, for after I
had used a few boxes, I was thoroughly cured, and have not
had a pain since. I ean now get about and do my housework,
aud after the fourteen years’ pain which I suffered, the en-
tire cure made me feel like a new woman altogether. The
cure must be permanent, as I went through all last winter
without any pains whatever. I have recommended the pills to a
large number of my friends, and can advise anyone suffering as i
I did, to take them.”

“From the Start!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the year of the Big Strike. Mick Sheedy
and Jack Devine had battled from the Diaman-
tina to the “North West Corner” without having
so much as got their hands into wool during the
whole dreary ten weeks.
To be sure there were many “cuts” offering,
but Sheedy and Devine clung to their Union
tickets, though their clothes were worn threadbare
and their horses woefully leg-weary.
Their luck was clearly dead-out, for they never
seemed to strike a union shed until at least a week
after roll-call; and no matter how keenly their
anxious eyes scanned the walls of the far-off wool-
shed as they tiredly “ heeled ” their jaded steeds
across the plain, never had they discerned one
trap door idle —never a gap in the long, irregular
volley of out-popping, snow-white jumbucks to
betoken a vacant stand inside. So at last they
grew too hopeless to even glance at the busy shed
shimmering through the sun-haze, and invariably
made straight for the huts —and the cook.
They had avoided the strike-camps as far as
possible ; they weren’t quite “stiff,” and scorned
to eat Union tucker while they could buy—or
steal—from the squatters, or strike a Union shed
for supper and breakfast, and a shake-down in
the woolshed, or on the long tables in the
shearers’ hut. And both were well enough known
to Queensland strike-leaders to be trusted with a
roving commission.
But even in Union sheds some of the shearers—
“slow tigers” and Viotorian cookies, mostly—
objected to “ feedin* travellers,” and, half in joke,
half in earnest, ask the cook pointed questions
“ before folk. ”
It was just daybreak at Wirraganna. The two
travellers had struck the station late the previous
night, with horses done-up, and Devine ditto with
sickness. The shearers were swarming silently
from their bunks, and flitting hurriedly but stiffly
to and fro the river bank with soap and towel,
their toil-drawn faces showing pale atad haggard
in the ghostly dawn.
“What’ll it run to this year, cook?” asked a
young giant who, pint-pot in hand, stood with
his back to the roaring fire. The speaker had
probably never been ten miles away from the
paternal potato-patch at Bungaree until the pre-
vious shearing ; but he spoke with the assuranoe
of a veteran, and regarded Sheedy and Devine—
who had just come in for coffee and brownie, pre-
paratory to making an early start—with some-
thing like soorn—the scorn of the superior person,
with an assured inoome, for a possibly better
out of a job.
Devine at once turned and walked out, ooffee-
less, cold and sick. (His mates said that Jack
Devine was too thin in the bide for this blanky
country.)
“ A lot of these fellows is lookin’ fer work and
prayin’ ter Gawd they won’t find it. That’s my
blanky opinion, anyway,” continued Bungaree,
insultingly—to nobody in particular.
Sheedy slowly looked the fellow up-and-down,
took up a pannikin, walked to the fireplace, un-
ceremoniously shouldered the young yahoo aside,
dipped out a cup of coffee—and jumped back just
in time to avoid a kick.
“ Come outside ! ” blustered Bungaree.
“All right; but wait till I drink this.”
The hut was in an uproar by this time, but the
lank Queenslander sat on the end of the table,
chewing his “ brownie ” and leisurely sipping his
coffee. When he had finished, he slowly up-ended,
and followed the crowd outside to where a ring
had been formed, and Bungaree stood stripped
and foaming for battle.
Sheedy asked to see the “Rep.” The latter,
who was ringer as well as union representative,
was found busy at the grindstone.
“ Well,” he asked, “ what’s up ?”
“Union business,” replied Sheedy.
“ Hurry up, then ; the bell ’ll ring in a minute.”
“Got to fight this man,” said Sheedy. “But
I don’t want to risk bein’ belted by a scab. I
want to see his tickets. Here’s mine,” and he
handed out a dilapidated pocket-book.
The “Rep.” opened the book and sorted out a
bundle of grimy Union tickets. “ I see,” he said
—“financial from the start. And what’s this !
A loyalty ticket ? You’re all right, mate. But”—
“I’m no cadger, that’s all,” replied Sheedy ;
“ and I want to see this fellow’s paper for satis-
faction.” ,
The shearers, who had crowded round to see the
fun, grew interested.
“That’s fair,” said one elderly Monaro man.
And the crowd followed the lead. “ Show yer
paper, Bungaree,” they cried.
Bungaree unwillingly handed two Union tickets
to the “Rep.” “This year’s and last,” he ex-
plained. “ I only learnt last year. ”
“ Where’d last year’s ticket come from ? ” asked
Sheedy. The “Rep.” spelled out the signature
of the agent.
“What shed?”
“Dunno,” replied the “Rep.” “Deniliquin
office, though. What shed, Bungaree?”
“ What’s that to do with you?” growled Bun-
garee, savagely. “ I’m a Union man ; ain’t that
enough ?”
An expressive nod passed round the grinning
circle.
“So you learnt in a scab shed ? ” said Sheedy.
“ I thought so ! But as you’re a Union man now,
T s’pose I’ll have to put ’em up. Come on 1 ”
ak ßU j ga J 6 j “, came on” with a vengeance, but
Sheedy dodged and fell. ’
“ Stand up to him, man!” urged the Monaro
man who was seconding Sheedy in lieu of the
Union 106 ' elt anx^ous for the honor of the
-A-g&in Bungaree rushed, and again Sheedy went
down without a blow. There was another growl
of disapproval from the onlookers, and, as the
overseer was seen walking across from the “ bar-
racks to the woolshed, a few left the battlefield
considering such a tame exhibition poor compen-
sation for the loss of a sheep in the day’s tally.
-*7 U , P and finish ifc! ” exclaimed the
a half-start and an anxious look in
the direction of the shed.
Devine, who stood by, pale and ill, turned,
looked j; at the Monaro man, and winked. The
Kep. saw the wink, dropped his shears again,
and waited. ’
, Dungaree again rushed, and again Sheedy
dodged, but this time, instead of falling, he took
Bungaree low down and threw him heavily,
ihere was a yell of approval, and thirty hats went
flying into the air.
.When the fallen man was helped up it was seen
tnat the fight was over; his right wrist was badly
sprained.
_ “ Sta y to breakfast,” called the “Rep.” to
Sheedy, as the shearers hurried away in response
to the shed-bell, leaving the travellers and the
damaged Bungaree to make friends as best they
might. ■ J
Bungaree 6 °°° ked my shearin £> anyway,” said
Book here, said Sheedy. “ You’re an ignor-
ant pup; but you’ll grow out of that in time.
My mate s sick; prads knocked-up. I want a
week s cut. Go and see the boss and get him to
give me your stand. You can have it again when
your hand’s better.’’
Bungaree considered, saw that the proposal was
better than the probability of losing his stand for
good, and interviewed the boss as requested.
“ a dead man’s place,” explained
the. Rep.” to the others at breakfast-time, “for
Bungaree made it right with the boss.”
So Sheedy got a Union cut after all.
In ten days’ time Devine was better, the horses
were fit to travel, and Bungaree returned to his
place on the board.
The boss hinted that he could make room for
Sheedy and his mate by “shooting” two less
competent hands.
“We’re Union-men from the start,” said
Sheedy; and the overseer said no more. Nor
was he much surprised that Sheedy refused to
accept payment for the thousand sheep he had ‘
shorn. “ Pay my mate’s tuclcer-bill out of it,” he
said ; “ and pay the station for our horses’ grass,
if you like. The rest
is Bungaree’s. So
long, boss.”
And th e mates
again battled out
across the whitening
plains in search of a
“Union cut.”

radoes, they held on
to their bundles and
almost yelled for the

the conclusion that
the lift was a death-

A Case of Snake-bite.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is the Rev. Samuel Stipper’s Sabbath custom
to take a walk in the early morning, and on these
occasions it is my delight to accompany him a
few miles along the bush-road outside the town-
ship, returning with him in time for service.
On a recent Sunday the weather was particu-
larly fine, and we stepped out well, the Reverend
in high spirits, whistling softly as he went, and
switching off the heads of thistles and dandelions
along the track. As ho struck once at a thistle,
the cane flew from his hand, and he was stooping
to pick it up when suddenly he uttered a cry and
started back. A was wriggling away
through the dust. I darted after it and killed it
with my stick, but when I looked towards Mr.
Stipper I was horrified to see him leaning against
the fence, his face ashy pale and his right hand
held out before him.
No need to ask what was the matter. I Caught
sight of a drop of blood on the baok of his hand;
and, clutching his arm, I half-carried him to a
house, fortunately but a couple of hundred yards
away.
It was a bush inn, and I laid the sufferer on a
sofa in the parlor, where half-a-dozen men were
drinking.
“ Whisky,” cried several when I explained :
“ it’s the only thing, sir.” The landlord brought a
bottle, and filled a medium glass with the stuff,
neat.
“ Must I take whisky,” feebly said the patient,
who was a teetotaller. “Is there nothing else? ”
“Nothing,” said the landlord in an inexorable
tone, amid corroborative murmurs. “ It’s the only
thing, sir ; I’ve used it on myself.”
Tears flowed down my reverend friend’s cheeks
as he gulped it; then the landlord filled the glass
again. “ Down with it! ”he said—“ it’s your only
chance of life.”
The face of the afflicted one blazed-up red as the
“ liquid sunshine ” coursed through his chanriels,
and anon he brightened somewhat and sat-up.
“Have another, sir,” said the man with the
bottle. The Reverend raised his hand deprecat-
ingly, but the dose was poured out, and he drank
it almost at a gulp.
The patient held out his hand, and, after brief
examination, the “ bite ” was unanimously pro-
nounced a thistle-scratch 1 The Rev. Samuel had
had three stiff jorums on false pretences, as it were •
and, as it was evidently time for us to go I paid-
up and led my friend away. I was apprehensive
of results, but apparently not so the Reverend
He resumed his whistling, and walked jauntily’
if somewhat unsteadily, along.
“ You had better get some one else to preach
this morning,” I remarked tentatively, eying him.
“Pooh! not I!” he said, beaming. “Going
to preach myself—never felt better in my life ' ”
He seemed all right mentally ; and, supposing
the giddiness would pass off, I let things go, and
we arrived at the church.
The Reverend gravely mounted to his place, and
his voice was rich and full as he gave out the first
hymn ; he even stood up and joined in it himself.
j.hen he prayed, and the people said afterwards
that they had never heard such an impressive and
eloquent petition. But, while the choir was after-
wards singing an anthem, I was horrified to see
that the Reverend was smiling beatifically at
things in general, and noisily beating time with a
hymn-book. His face was fiery red, and he
swayed about perceptibly when he rose to preach.
“Shubjeck of my addresh t’day, my friepsh,”
he said, “ ish—Temperansh—Hvilsh of Shtrong
Drin—Drink ! Itsh cursh, in’ brethren !” he went
on, beaming all round and leaning heavily on the
cushion. “Alwaysh excep’—wh—(hie)—whisky !
Whiskysh goo—good ! Speshally f’r shnake—(hie)
—bitesh ! Yes, my frensh, when whishky bitesh
you, alwaysh take plenty—(hie)—snaksh !”
His head dropped on the desk, his knees bent
beneath him, and he disappeared from our view
with a hollow thump.
I judged it was about time for an explanation,
so I arose and gave one in a few words ; but, when
several of us ascended the pulpit, the Reverend
Samuel had recovered sufficiently to challenge us
to mortal combat.
“Think, because I’m parshon, I can’t fight!
I’ll —hie—show you ! ”
And then, as we led him gently away, he shed .
tears and hiccups on our necks. But at last we
got him to bed.

The Best Family Medicine

Aid Digestion, and Make the Blood Rich and Red.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

“I wish to say to every one that I have used a great deal of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla in my family. I believe it is the best family medicine there is
in the world.
“ Once, while I was on a vessel trading to the East Indies and also while I
was liying in Calcutta, I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for impurities in my blood,
and with the best results. I always took a stock of it with me when I went on
my voyages. I could not feel safe without it., For eruptions of the skin, boils,
and such affections it is a quick and sure cure. I recommend it to everybody
suffering from impurities in the blood, showing itself in any way whatsoever.”
This is what Mr. W. A. Lindsay (whose portrait, with that of his wife and
child, is here given), of Stanthorpe, Queensland, Australia, thinks of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. Because of the multitude of such cases, the people call Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because some other preparation may be called a sarsaparilla is not the
slightest reason that it is anything like “Ayer’s” Sarsaparilla. If you wish
these quick results, these safe results, these sure results, you must insist upon
getting “Ayer’s.” Make a particular point of this.
