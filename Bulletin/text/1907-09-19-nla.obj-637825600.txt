THE AUTHORS' KINDERGARTRN
mo you, author, would-be author, or
I won’t-be author, these little Kinder-
garten lessons are given by Adam
Lorimer in his Author's Progress : a
Literary Book of the Road (Blackwood, per
Dymock’s Library). The teacher assumes
that you are writing for fame and money ;
but he warns you that there is no royal road
to either.
Some few years aero it seemed to lie in the direc-
tion of composing Khaki ballads ; then a short cut
appeared to present itself, through Fiscal Odes.
At this moment a book of Tales of Little England
looks promising.
But the publisher’s reader is the sign-post
that there is no straight highway to publica-
tion. The publisher’s reader is also a
struggling author.
Do you think (asks Lorimer) that any man who
is wise enough in art and style and story-telling
to sit in judgment on your work would not rather
use his wisdom in getting his own works pub-
lished ?
In choosing a publisher for your first novel,
submit your MS. to the publisher of the
novel you have imitated. For you are sure
to have imitated some story, and to have
persuaded yourself that you had surpassed
it. Do not traffic with the literary agent,
and, above all, little girl, do not get your
portrait in the papers.
“Is this the face that launched a thousand re
views?” says the disenchanted male reader
mockingly.
So, gentle authoress, do not enter into com-
petition with actresses and dancers; the
struggle is not on even terms, for they do
not restrict the camera to their faces. Stick
to fiction, even about yourself, and, idealised
male author, do not submit your bald head
to the camera-—unless you are so ugly as to
excite comment, for cumulative comment is
the foundation of all fame. Send in your
MS. without a preliminary letter. Do not
send a friend; do not call. And do not
envy the publisher, for out of a successful
novel he gets merely money; you get money
plus fame. A publisher never reaches
fame. And he deals in a commodity far less
certain of judgment than beer. What the
publisher and his adviser are trying to deter-
mine is whether there is anything in your
MS. which the public will like, and if it is
there in payable quantities. And when you
have tried all the publishers in vain, sit
down calmly and compose another story.
You can stiffen your courage for this worka-
day world by reading The Athenaeum.
There,
You will see that all books by living authors
are faulty, except Aylwin, and there is scarce
one but contains misprints and errors of spelling.
It will do you good to learn that there is no novel
of , w'orth but it might have been better if the
author had taken less pains. What ails all writers
is trying to be great and pass The Athenaeum.
Assuming your book to be of the normal
size of about 350 pages, and that an edition
of 1050 copies is produced, the cost of setting
up, printing, binding and advertising may be
taken as £lOO. (These figures, of course, apply
merely to England.) Concede the publisher
another £l5 for bare business expenses.
‘ ‘ Even authors will not work for nothing
when their business is old and established.”
Now, the publisher must be recouped for
this outlay before the author can hope for
any profits. To do this he must sell 680
copies. A novel published at 6s. and selling
at 4s. 6d. is sold to the booksellers at a price
that comes out about 3s. 4But only a
poor minority of novels attain to a sale
of 680 copies. The usual agreement with
your publisher is that the first 250,
300 or 400 copies shall be sold for
the publisher’s sole account. On every
copy sold over that number you receive 10
per cent, of the published price—say, for a
6s. novel, 6JcL —for books, like rolls, are
sold to the trade at thirteen to the dozen.
Of the 1050 copies printed, 100 will go to the
press for review. If the publisher is to sell
400 copies before your royalty begins, there
remain 550 copies. Thus your gross gain on
a novel, every copy of which has been spld,
is £l5 4s. KM. The remainder of the revenue
on the venture, amounting to about £5O,
goes to the publisher'. But the publisher
/does not always get that £5O clear, nor any-
thing like that sum. If the novel gets over
the 600 mark and seems like continuing, the
publisher spends something extra in adver-
tising, in the hope of carrying it to a second
edition. You are not called upon to contri-
bute toward this expenditure. ■
We come to this then, that a single-edition
novel is of no monetary value to anybody except
(as we sincerely trust may sometimes be the case)
the reader. . . Let the young author look upon it
as a gift to the public. . . The publisher is taking
a risk in which the chances are that he will make
a loss.
The other way is to publish “on commis-
sion,’’which means that you take all the
risk and pay for it. But remember that
when a publisher offers to publish “on
commission ” he shows he has little faith in
the book, for at the best his profit from the
venture will be very small indeed And .. .
about one-third of all first novels published
see the light under this “on commission ”
principle, and the commissions therefrom are
small and the profits nil. 1
Jt
Lorimer has a cynical word for you, who
complain that reviewers do not read your
novel through. His contention is that no
competent reviewer ever needs to. By long
practice he arrives quickly at a judgment of
a story.
Having got hold of the persons of the tale in the
first chapters, he knows the hero must marry the
woman, or not marry the woman, or die. The
woman must obviously marry the man, not marry
the man, or die. He or she may either of them
marry and die, marry and live, not marry and
die, or not marry and live, marry and be happy,
or marry and be unhappy, or both die and be done
with it. The end chapters show which event the
author has selected. The middle shows how the
event is prepared. And as it has all been done
before by other authors, and as people in stories
never behave as in actual life, but always accord-
ing to one of the schemes of novel-life, the re-
viewer can rapidlv judge what scheme the author
has selected, and how it has been carried out.
This may seem very clever, but, as a matter of
fact, it is very easy. The question, however,
which the aggrieved author puts is whether it is
honest. The answer appears to be that in nine
cases out of ten it is sufficient... Yet the re-
viewer is not a dishonest man. He is a profes-
sional taster of novels.
Just to trouble that professional novel-
taster we mean to write a novel in which
there will be five heroines, all already mar-
ried, and thirteen heroes, nine of them
widower's, and all the heroes and heroines
will be killed by a dynamite explosion in the
middle of the first chapter, and the rest of
the book will be devoted to an absorbing
narrative of the fluctuating fortunes of a
small grocery business 'in Romeo, U.S.A.
The most expert novel-taster couldn’t de-
finitely say whether it lived happy ever
after. Also, we are contemplating some ex-
citement on the part of reviewers when
The Trend. That Didn’t appears in book
form.
\ • d*
Coming, now, to the business side of book-
selling :
Almost the first thought that occurs to an
author whose book hangs fire is, How can I get at
the Royal Family ? If the Queen would only
accept a copy ! . . . All the upper circles would
read that book as long as the Queen (whom God
bless) was reading it. And the middle circles
would read it all day, over and over again, in
ever-increasing felicity that they were doing what
the Queen did, and it would he such a beautiful
book. . . . But it cannot be done. . . . And yet if
it pleased His Majesty by Royal letters patent to
command a novel, there are now waiting 365
authors ready at a moment’s notice to make him
a story each, wherein the characters should do
whatever His Majesty might please to order.
But though Royal patronage is not avail-
able, and Mr. Gladstone is dead, there are
bishops and millionaires-:—the millionaires
practically untapped. There is also The
British Weekly. This paper (asserts Lorimer)
can induce more people to buy a novel than
can the entire press of the United Kingdom,
including The Quarterly Review. For‘“ The
British Weekly reaches a public which as
nearly resembles The Public as ever a part
can resemble a whole.”
Finally, young author, do not be in a hurry
to give up your regular job.
The woes of authors are nearly all imaginary,
but none is so fallacious as the belief that if the
authors had more money and entire leisure they
would be greater writers. Consider the men who
had tmie on their hands, Ruskin, Browning and
bhelley. They would all have been better had
they written less. When had Shakespeare time
to write ? In the intervals of play-acting and
managing his theatrical ventures. Compare with
him Mr. Gr. B. Shaw, and it will be seen that the
difference is really one of leisure. Mr. Shaw has
time not only to write plays, but to preach and
make odious comparisons. How® much better
Mr. Shaw’s plays would have been had he been
Clerk to the London County Council. They
bristle with evidences that he could fill the office
to admiration.
Youthful authors, the class is dismissed.
An excellent shilling reprint of John Farrell’s
Hoio He Died, and Other Poems, is issued by Angus
and Robertson (Sydney). The biographical notes
published in the five-shilling edition (same phb-
lishers) do not appear in this reprint; but the
verses do not need any introduction.
Angus and Robertson, Sydney, have included
in their Commonwealth Series Henry Lawson’s
stories that first appeared under the caption,
Children of the Bush. The two one-shilling
volumes are titled Send Round the Hat and The
Romance of the Sw-ag. These stories are the real
Australia, written by the foremost living Aus-
tralian author. In this cheaper form the stories
should go everywhere throughout the Common-
wealth. Lawson’s genius remains as vivid and
human as when he first boiled his literary billy
TWO SONNETS BY KVKLYN TiIHBLF.I ZL
THE RECOMPENSE.
Forsake us not, dear Love ! though oft we cast
Thy hitter burdens in the barren dust;
The footsteps of Fatality unjust
May never fail to follow to the last.
And memory walks beside the sullen Past,
Pale for her wasted days , and broken trust,
Alas, Death's keenest dart could never thrust
Till the worn heart should wince, and hold Life fast.
We have so much to bear, oh Love, our Lord !
No time to gather strength ’twixt pang and pang,
Or even recall how mystic minstrels sang
Thy rapturous psalm. And yet we grasp the sword !
And hold it, through the darkness, to our breast,
Thou who hast given us Joy wilt give us Rest.
THE THREE CHALICES.
Life leaned to me across his fading wreath.
And showed three cups of gold placed side by side
Upon his table — “ What are these l” / cried.
“ These are the chalices of Fate," Life saith ;
‘ 4 In one, the milk of meek content, beneath
All censure of the gods—wrath, scorn, or pride ;
And one has bitter wine of Dreams denied,
And one is perfect rapture mixed with Death.
4 4 Which wilt thou choose ? ” quoth Life. I leaned
on him
And touched the cup filled full of joy that slays,
And cast therein all future hours and days,
And saw the bright years bubble up, and swim,
And break themselves against the golden rim,—
Till Life's face passed in darkness from my gaze.

OUR SAUSAGE SERIAL
Charles is dead. He was slain with enthusiasm
by forty-two writers in forty-seven ways. So
henceforth he can be consicfered very dead. The
unkindest death of all was his being crushed to
death by seven footmen falling on him from a
carriage. Also, “he hastily swallowed a pine-
apple.”
“Boronia” writes:—“l tried my hand at
serialising, but I succeeded in penning so many
Murders, Shrieks, Thrills, Fits, and Spasms, that
I got the horrors.”
Meantime, a retrospect, for which the author
declines payment, has come mysteriously to hand,
clearing up some of 'Our justifiable suspicions
about Alice’s parentage. As . this is. a cheap
serial, we seize the opportunity to insert this
gratis chapter. The author of ' Chapter VI. is
R. O. Batchelor, Foundry-street, Minyip, Vic-
toria.
As Alice is getting quite a big girl now, it is
quite time she was married.
THE TREND THAT DIDN’T.
( By the Red page Hunt Caloman . J. M. Leape,
H. paton, “Anon.” and. R.C. Batohelor.)
CHAPTER V.—-SOME FAMILY HISTORY.
Alice’s father had hanged himself when she was
young. Her mother then married Samuel Black-
adder. Soon after she died from spontaneous com-
bustion. Samuel Blackadder married again, and
then took poison and cut his throat, at the same
time shooting himself and falling from a roof on
to a spike. His widow, Alida Blackadder,
married Horace Cheese, and was never seen again.
Horace Cheese stole Alice’s fortune of £1,000,000,
cut her hair short, and cast her out, throwing a
bucket of water over her as she departed.
Consequently Alice was typist to an ice-cream
barrow.
(Wedding bells, please !)
Music and Light and Other Verses, by A. W.
Brazier (printed by; the author, Melb.) is interest-
ing as a fine specimen of amateur printing and
binding. It is illustrated by reproductions of
well-known Australian gallery pictures, and
(quite superfluously) by wood-cuts of Australian
flora. As for the verses, they are merely quite
unnecessary—neither musical nor light—and as
inspired as the wood-cuts.
CHAPTER VI.—THE PASSING OP
CHARLES.
The night quailed before the coming
day.
Alice gazed thoughtfully at the
corpse on the table.
The clot of bloody on its breast
gleamed in the sunlight.
“ What a lovely shade for my Spring
hat,” exclaimed Alice.
She raised the window-sash, and
looked out.
Round the corner came two fire-
engines, an escaped lunatic, and a
Customs officer.
Contrary to expectations, no earth-
quake occurred.
Seizing the pineapple-man by the
whiskers, the Customs officer, drawing
a copy of the tariff from his waistcoat
pocket, pointed out, “ Pineapples,
999|%.” At this moment the fire-
engines burst simultaneously.
Charles, who had lain hidden in the
boiler of one, was forced to quit his
seclusion.
The escaped lunatic, who was really
Carruthers in one of the famous dis-
guises of Black. Hands (Ltd.), glared
fiercely at him.
With a ferocious yell he smote
Charles over the cranium with a roll
of Guv’ment netting.
“Die,” he hissed.
Charles died.
His last words were never said, and
the fearsome mystery remains as
baffling as ever.
ENGLISH PROSODY
“We have as yet no established system of
prosody,” declares T. S. Ormond, after a detailed
examination of English metrical criticism during
the last two centuries. His book, English
Mctrists (Henry Fronde), is of value less for his
criticism of writers on prosody than for the con-
clusions implied in those criticisms. Ormond’s
authoritative work is a plea for a scansion in-
finitely broader than the strict formality of the
grammar-books. And, above all, he insists upon
the necessity of counting pauses in the line as well
as syllables. A foot made up of a syllable and a
pause can metrically be equal to a foot made up of
two or more syllables. The only true scansion is
time-scansion. Thus, supplying the obvious
“rest” or pause after Praise, there is no irregu-
larity in the lines :
Morning, evening, noon and night,
“Praise a God!” sang Theocrite.
Ormond’s contention is that three elements
must be distinguished in every spoken sound —
pitch, force, and duration. Pitch is synonymous
with height of tone, force with loudness ; duration
means the “quantity”—the time syllables take to
pronounce.
“The only question of consequence for the
measuring of verse is, does or dees not accent —
usually defined as force—also imply duration, does
emphasizing a syllable necessarily prolong its
utterance? There is certainly a well-marked
tendency this way. The typical Scot, as in his
pronunciation of releegion, likes to prolong the
accented vowel. . . . But it is, after all, only a
tendency. It seems impossible,to argue that, in
our ordinary speech, accentuation necessarily
implies prolongation. Accent with us does not
necessarily imply elevation of pitch, or increase of
loudness, or prolongation of time. Normally we
like to unite all three on one syllable. But it is
possible to accentuate a syllable by lowering the
voice instead of raising it, by uttering it more
softly instead of more loudly, by shortening
instead of prolonging its duration. Any device
which thus distinguishes a syllable from its fellows
makes it conspicuous,.and this conspicuousness is
what we really mean by ‘ accent ’. . . . In common
talk, as in oratory or verse, every second or third
syllable is usually rendered conspicuous in seine
way, and a dead level of pronunciation is repulsive
to us.
“In any Ordered succession of articulate" or
inarticulate sounds an interval of silence may on
occasion be substituted for utterance, and may
count toward the total result; just as in dancing
a measured interval of quiescence may form part
of the ‘steps,’or as in music ‘rests’are an in-
tegral part of the bar. . . . Pauses, as well as
syllables, go to make up the metrical unit. . . The
pause which follows a line of verse I regard as
extra-metrical, when it exists at all ; the rests or
pauses which occur during a' line I regard as
integral to structure, proved to be so by their
taking places occupied in other lines by syllables
or parts of syllables. . . . Hearers are slow to
admit the reality of such pauses. They will often
deny the existence of any silent interval, even
when phonetic Considerations prove that such
interval must occur. Recognition of these silent
spaces is'essential to just prosody, and often
revolutionizes our ideas of a line’s actual struc-
ture.”
However, Ormond has no precise theory of
prosody to offer. His book —a little too much
occupied with trivial critical and technical details
—abounds in interesting suggestions; and is
throughout written with a broadness and sanity
that will assist in freeing English verse from the
carking thrall of the strict scansion ist, with his
mechanical measured beat, the eternal tap-tap of
the formalist’s hammer, making our verse a dead
and machine-like thing. For instance, there is
the fact that the best poets sometimes substitute
a weak syllable for an expected strong one.
Ormond contends that it is not likely that this
occasional liberty from the hammer of the
mechanical beat is a fault. An occasional
weak accent relieves the oppression of
a too insistent beat; it gives to verse
the freedom and rhythm of a living thing.
“ Does not some of even our most brilliant verse
suffer from the perpetual hammer-beat of a syl-
labic accent, leaving the ear no liberty, but
monotonously enforcing rhythm ? On the other
hand, in the work of our most accomplished
singers—even in such exquisite work as that of
Miss Rossetti —is there not sometimes a tendency
to let syllabic and temporal' beats wander too far
apart, so that occasionally the ear is puzzled to
bring them together ? In all verse, are we not
conscious of slight divergence between the uni-
form temporal beat and the varying syllabic
accent ? To say that these habitually coincide is
surely doing despite to our judgment.”
It is toward the interpretation of these
reasons for this larger rhythm that the prosodists
are now groping. And of the future of English
verse, indicated rather than hindered by Walt
Whitman, there is no fear. “So long as high
emotion craves appropriate utterance, so long as
in moments of excitement it is more natural to
dance than to walk, rhythmic expression of some
sort will assuredly continue.”
OSCAR WILDE.
Laureate of corruption, on whose brow
The leaves of fame are frosted by the worm,
Thou art a nightingale, whose songs affirm
The canker in the rosebud, from a bough
Of the dark cypress warbling. Some strange vow
Thy spirit must have taken before birth
To some strange god, to desecrate the earth
With visions vile and beautiful as thou.
We loathe thee with the sure, instinctive dread
Of young things for the graveyard and the scar.
And though Grod wept when Lucifer’s great
star,
With its long train, cried from the deeps blood-
red.
Still must we name thee with the second dead,
For when the angels fall they fall so far !

A Young Man’s
Restoration
The Evidence
from 104 Morehead Street, "Redfern,
Sydney, N.S.ff'., September Ist, 1905.
“For years my son Arthur, aged 18,
had been a great sufferer from weak-
ness of the chest and lungs, and he
was also troubled with severe pains in
the back and kidneys. I tried very
many preparations without success,
until at last, hearing of the great good
it had achieved in similar cases, I tried
Scott’s Emulsion. An immediate im-
provement set in; Arthur was able to
eat and sleep well, which he had long
been unable to do. A course of Scott’s
built up his system and gave him
strength and enriched *blood. He is
now restored to complete good health,
and has gained very considerably in
weight ”
(Mrs.) JESSIE) FOSS.
The Reason Why
He got his Strength
CJ The potency of Scott’s comes from
the pure, vigorous Lofoten oil, of
which it is made, and from the
original Scott process, by which it is
manufactured. Result: (1) Immense
invigorating power ; (2) Perfect
digestibility; (3) Attrac-
tive taste. These quali-
ties are of sovereign
worth for young men
and women, just as they
are for older folks and
babies. But be sure the
emulsion is SCOTT’S,

“ The fishman with the
fish” on every package.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Prisoner.
In a solitary cell,
Secret and inscrutable,
And the whence he may not stir
I have caged a prisoner.
Many, many years there be
Since he came to lodge with me,
Since that night I heard him breathe
In the dungeon underneath.
Straining at the prison-bars
To attain once more the stars.
Not all lorn, unhappy, he
Whom mine eyes may never see;
In still nights I hear soft things
At his bars preen rocking wings,
Whisp’ring oracle and spell
While he walks his secret cell.
And when I, his jailer, moan
For the sunshine that has flown,
By his flutt’ring sighs I know
He would have my gloom to go;
And when Joy her glory flings,
Like a slow-swung harp he sings.
I have never found the way
To his hiding, any day.
What he is, I may not say.
This I know : He is content
Where his gliding days are spent;
This, too: That one time shall be,
When, despite my care, and me,
Death shall ope the door, and there
Lead him forth, the prisoner.
MAORILAND.
C. ALLAN MARRIS.
From a Southern Garden.
Rich with the breath of one green hour ,
Across my senses’ labyrinth
There threads the scent of hyacinth,
There trails the tender pc ssion-Jtowcr.
Of opiate-noons a world-span hence,
Sleeping in censered somnolence,
Insidious-sweet you breathe (as might
A floating hint of bergamot,
Of dim swan-shouldered dames in white)—
By some grey fortalice forgot,
Whereon—world old when the world was young—
Dryad, Naiad, and goat-foot Pan,
Where mottling shadows stilled and swung,
Jostled and clutched and ran
Through shade to sun on the frescoed plinth,
Through sun to shade on the leaning tower,
O sensuous-scented hyacinth,
Frail-fingered passion-flower !
Still as the soul of an anchorite
The flaked moon lay in the leaves at night.
The shaking shaft of the fountain leapt
(O dear, dark grove where the shadows slip !),
Broke into wavering tears and wept
Far down where the basin’s brimming lip
Lay kissed by the lapping water-rings ;
While silvern thither and sable here
The white night touched, and her windless wings
Stayed as she stooped to peer
Through the gloried gaps of the broken plinth,
Through the wide blind eyes of the windowed
tower,
0 languorous heavy hyacinth,
Pale splendid passion-flower!
Here in this corner-plot apart,
One crystal drop in your pendent heart
Hanging—perchance ’tis a wayward tear —
Twined sinuous-fingered round the feet
Of indolent marble Belvidere,
O passion-flower, you droop to meet
(While the pang of a white-hot pain strikes
through
The midmost self and the soul of me,
For the warmth of the wider noons we knew)
Your upturned chastity,
O waxen-throated hyacinth !
Do you grieve for the green of your moss-bound
tower ?
Do you pine for your shadowy shattered plinth,
My princely passion-flower ?
vic.
JAMES A. ALLAN.
Evening.
Clear sky and dark horizon,
With fleecy cirri strewn,
Translucent, opalescent,
Wherein a silver crescent
Foretells a waxing moon.
But such ethereal beauty
No painter may achieve
With pigments red and yellow ;
So tender-toned and mellow
Is this Australian eve.
And, dark against the skyline,
The tall trees rear their stems,
Uplifted to the spaces—
Those high and airy places
Aglow with many gems.
An evanescent lustre
Has gathered in the west;
The dim cloud-region changes
To fairy lakes and ranges—
The splendid Realm of Rest.
Naught all the wide world over
Such beauty shall surpass;
Nor any art transcended,
Such form and color, blended
With music in the grass.
Nor shall we pass unheeding
Such wonder-themes, that weave
The sun’s celestial fingers;
Th%t such a glory lingers
In this Australian eve.

sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of

THE N.S.W. STATE ELECTION.
Three years ago the people of N.S.W. declared
at the polls their solid appreciation of Joseph
Carruthers— an appreciation which probably
arose not so much from any real admiration of
Joseph as from a conviction of the incapacity of
Waddell and the ineptitude of McGowen.
Last week they went to the polls again, and
solemnly recorded their greatly diminished
admiration of the same old Joseph. Iheoreti-
cally he ought to have been a great deal
stronger than he was three years ago. He had
coalesced with Waddell and his party, and got
at the back of him whatever influence Waddell
and his party could raise. He was supposed to
have gained a great accession of power and influ-
ence by swiping feebly, but wildly, at the atmo-
sphere in the capacity of the defender of Ma
State against all manner of imaginary wrongs;
and the public was assured that these
wrongs were very real, and that the people
felt them very keenly, and that the Premier
who swiped wildly at the atmosphere on the
matter had fearned their undying gratitude.
Carruthers had with him the secession push, if
there is such a thing, and the “bloodshed and
revolution ” party, if it exists, and whatever sup-
port and credit and glory were the natural
perquisite of the Man Who Stole the Wire. The
importing interests were supposed to gather
round JOSEPH as a protest against the new
National tariff; it is difficult to see what they
■could gain by it, but the State Insect was set up
as the living embodiment of protest against the
tariff, and three Sydney daily papers gave their
certificate that he was the genuine article. These
three Sydney dailies propped him up all through
with a reckless fury of commendation ; and the
fourth—the helpless, speechless, muddling Star
-gave him an exhausted leg-up every now and
again Tim Anti-Sosh movement, which was
invented by Carruthers’ old mate and fellow-
iniauity, Reid, was with the Government—that is
to say such remnants of the old bogey as were still
on deck! The old, grudging, narrow Provincial
spirit of Svdney—the spirit which has ™ade the
Svdney importers, and the importers’ papers and
the importers’ politicians, and the Cabbage-Tree
Mob throw vague denunciations at Victoria t
the past 40 years—came to Joseph’s aid with any
forces they could collect. He called upon the
element of uneasy piety, and the beer-suppres-
sionists. And, above all, he was helped by the
incapacity of James McGowen ; and incidentally
he waved his surplus, while denouncing the
Federal policy which created it; and he promised
remissions of taxation, and undertook to raise a
monument to a deceased policeman.
* * * *
With all these aids, that enthusiastic and reck-
less friend, the Sydney Telegraph, can only by
the most vociferous counting, find that Car-
ruthers has 43 pledged supporters in an Assem-
bly of 90. There are also eight or ten
stragglers who are expected to give him a
general support, but that is hardly the
glorious victory that was looked for. The
Carruthers Government sent out its direct
nominees—the men who were supposed to be
pledged to support the policy of Ma State
grievances, and anti-Federal lying, and sour,
dreary, venomous, depressed anti-Australian
grumbling, and the stealing of wire-netting ; the
men who were expected to howl bitterly about the
Australian capital, and drop vague veiled hints in
dark corners about secession and revolution, and
to oppose Australian manufactures and the em-
ployment of Australian capital and labor. And
despite all the influences behind them the
Carruthers nominees straggled back in a
minority. The Government has now to make
terms with unpledged supporters, most of whom
it has been fighting with all the vigor it could
command, to ensure its existence. And the direct
Opposition has gained strength ; it now num-
bers 32 members, and looks a trifle nearer to the
promised land of office than it ever did before,
especially as five political free-lances are expected
to vote with it on most questions.

But when one compares the Labor party that is
with the Labor party that might have been, it is
difficult to find words to describe the ineptitude
of the leader who threw the great chance away.
In the early stages of the campaign, with
McGowen in sole charge, the party’s cause looked
hopeless. It hadn’t the courage to declare itself
as the anti-borrowing party, the party of honest,
sound finance, and especially the party that was
for Australia and Australian union all the time,
and that was against wire-netting steals, and
insane ravings about “bloodshed.” It apologised
for the tariff instead of whooping for it, and it
professed to take a non-committal view of the
anti-Federal insanity. Then J. C. Watson came
and stirred things up. He spoke straight Federal-
ism, and straight, honest, courageous Australian
nationalism. He offered no humble apology
for a tariff that was designed to supply employ-
ment for Australian capital and Australian
workers. He came as a member of a Federal
party which has been against borrowing all the
time". And the dry bones of Labor stirred, and
became clothed with flesh, and lived. The coming
of Watson drove the party into more energetic
courses, and gave it a wider outlook ; instead of
looking down all the time at the end of Bill’s
pick and at the hole made by Bill’s shovel, it
began to look up at the wide horizon of all Aus-
tralia. Then, at the mere fag-end of the contest,
men suddenly began to awake to the possibility of
a Labor victory. The party didn’t gam a real
victory, because the new impetus came too late,
and because there was always the lumbering,
uninspired figure of McGowen in the back-
ground, and always the knowledge that it
wasn’t the capable, brilliant and reliable
Watson but the slow-moving figurehead from
Red fern who would be Premier if success
arrived. But that brief campaign by the Federal
Labor leader showed what an opening there is
in N.S.W. State politics for an able politician
to whom honesty, solvency, Australian national-
ism, Australian unity, the promotion of Australian
industry, and the brotherhood of the Australian
people are the whole gospel of man.
* • • •
At present it is difficult to forecast the future.
Premier Carruthers is pledged to the abolition
of a large portion of the income-tax and some
stamp duties, and to the reduction of railway
charges, and to a system of pensions for the
infirm, regardless of age, and to quite a number
of other things. If he lives up to these promises
he may presently be too busy borrowing money to
make much discord. On the other hand, he may,
despite his greatly diminished majority, go out
with straws in his hair, and a wild expression in
his eye, and a feather jin his bell-topper, and steal
some more wire netting or other goods. Or he
may suddenly lose all the instincts of a responsible
being and build a barricade in Market-street,
Sydney, just outside the Evening News office.
At present he is pledged to take a vague and hazy
referendum on three questions. One is a demand
for the permanency of the Bradiion Blot, which
was permanent in the original Federal Constitu-
tion, but which, at the insistent demand of the
Reid-CarRUTHERS Government of N.S.W., was
changed to be a mere temporary arrangement liable
to be abolished at the end of 10 years. Another
question on which Carruthers threatens to take
his little local vote is “ a more liberal and just
Constitution,” which can only mean the placing of
the Senate on a population basis, so that Victoria
will have 11 or 12 Senators in place of six. And the
third issue is a hazy matter about the Australian
capital. This is quite different from the referen-
dum Joseph threatened a few weeks ago, and the
referendum he threatens a week hence may fly off
the handle in an entirely fresh direction. On the
secession movement Carruthers has a solid and
reliable and avowed following of one; there may
be more, but only one is known for certain. On
the policy of being in all things a consistent
Mother Gummidge towards the Federal authority
it isn’t known what following he has; nobody
went to the poll quite openly on the Mother
Gummidge ticket. The wail about the new tariff
was worked for all it was worth, yet in Sydney
and suburbs, the stronghold of Foreign-trade, the
10 old members who were defeated consisted of two
Labor men, one independent, and seven followers
of Joseph ; while the eleven new members who
were returned consist of three independents, a
pledged Josephite, two unpledged Josephites, and
five Labor men. In the very stronghold of
Freetrade Joseph has thus swapped seven old
supporters for one reliable new one and two unre-
liables. Apparently the chief elements which
keep Carruthers still afloat on the political sea
are the habit of voting for the old Reid
faction ; a vague feeling of alarm and distrust as
regards the breakages that a possible Labor Minis-
try might perpetrate ; and the deep-rooted convic-
tion of every woman with a nice frock, and every
man with a plug hat that they must vote for nice,
“respectable,” plug-hatted candidates. Also one
candidate at least seems to have owed ins small
majority largely to afternoon tea. These are not
verv violent or sturdy materials out of which to
make a revolution, and it was perhaps in recogni-
tion of this fact that not a single Joey candidate
went to the polls on “bloodshed” principles,
with a gun under his arm. Carruthers’ lone
shout about gore was the one really slaughterous
episode of the campaign.
SURPLUSES AND OTHER MYTHS.
Bushels of figures have been scattered lately to
show the magnificent financial position to which
Carruthers and Providence have brought N. b.
Wales ; and the man is least likely to be deceived
who believes the fewest of them. Nothing is
more desirable than that the public should know
exactly how it stands; but the tricky politician
fighting for his life at a general election is about
the last man likely to let it know. Let us struggle
with the matter.
* * * *
The total revenue last year (that is, to June 30,
1907) was £13,406,544. The total ordinary expen-
diture was £11,913,272; and therefore, it is
announced, there was a surplus of £1,493,272.
That amount, it is alleged, was available to
repay debt or carry out works. Let us con-
sider first the revenue. It includes these, among
many more items that belong to the same
family :
Auction and other sales of land .. .. £b°'29,439
Royalty on minerals
Sale of Government property .. ..
Centennial Park land sales
Sales of resumed and acquired lands .. “
Seed wheat repayments 421
Total £1,157,852
Not one of those items is real revenue. The sales
of land are a straight-out conversion of assets ; and
there are only three places awaiting the indi-
vidual or firm or company which in private
business uses the proceeds of the sales of land as
ordinary revenue —(1) Bankruptcy Court, (2)
gaol, (3) lunatic asylum. Nothing is surer than
that the man who eats part of his stock
every day won’t have any stock at all if
he goes on eating long enough j and when his
stock is gone his means of making a living are
gone. N. S. Wales’ stock of public lands has
been an amazingly big one; but it is almost all
eaten up now. There is hardly any of it left
worth selling. When the State wants to supply
land in these days it has to buy it first; and so
an awful slump in the alleged “revenue of the
country looms not far ahead. Most of the other
smaller items mentioned above appear to be assets
actually purchased with borrowed money; and
instead of paying off the borrowed money when
the assets were sold, the proceeds have been passed
into revenue. If it is answered that the surplus
is used to pay off the borrowed money, then the
reply is that in that case the surplus is a fake.
A Treasurer might just as well and honestly add
the interest on his debt to the surplus, call the
whole lot surplus, and then proceed to pay the
interest out of it. The true revenue therefore
isn’t what it is alleged to be; it is more like
Alleged Revenue .. .. £13,406,544
Less Land Sales, etc.,.. .. 1,157,852
Actual Revenue .. .. £12,248,692
And that bring the surplus down to £335,420
before checking the expenditure.
*** . *
The trouble with the expenditure is, not that
there are items under this head which should be
somewhere else, but that there are items some-
where else which ought to be under ordinary ex-
penditure. Treasurer Carruthers introduced a
little juggle of his own about a couple of years
ago. It is called the Public Works Fund. A
culvert wants repairing ; but instead of repairing
it to-day, Carruthers saves the money and calls
it surplus, and to-morrow he votes the surplus to
a Public Works Fund, and spends it m repairing
the culvert. Anybody can have a surplus that
wav. After Billjim has got his weekly £3 he
can have a surplus of £2 10s. if he only buys his
clothes out of his wages; then, finding he has a
surplus of £2 10s., he can go and buy food with it.
He would have to buy food anyway ; and whether
Billjim buys it before or after he has declared
his surplus doesn’t make a bit of difference—it
won’t be a real surplus either way. If CAR-
RUTHERS spent the alleged surplus which he puts
into the Public Works Fund on permanent and
reproductive works—that is to say, if he added it
to the capital of the country-it would be real
surplus But the nearest approach to that sort ot
work on which Public Works Fund money was
spent last year consisted of courthouses ; and the
ss. that Jiggety Jane is fined on Monday morn-
ings is hardly enough to turn a courthouse into a
reproductive work. Mostly, in fact, Jiggety
Jane hasn’t got the ss„ and that means gaol; so
the courthouse is really the beginning of State
expenditure instead of State revenue Ihe bulk
of the expenditure in which this alleged
surplus went consisted of the building of new
bridges and culverts, and the repair and renewal
of old ones, the replacement of punts, erection
and renewal of police buildings, and oddments
like the erection of morgues and additions to
benevolent asylums; and there isn’t much repro-
ductiveness about that lot. Also £22,964 went
to the shires as part of the subsidy promised
under the new Local Government Act; and that
won’t bring in a penny to the State either. So m
one way and other £421,517 was charged to this
Public Works Fund last year ; and it is quite safe
to say that at least £350,000 should have been
paid out of revenue. That Fund was therefore
simply a contrivance for making the surplus look
£350,000 larger than it really was; and when
£350,000 has been deducted from a surplus that
has already gone down to £335,420, all that
remains is a deficit of £14,580.
* * * *
The whole matter boils down, then, to this :
Obviously a Treasurer can have as big a surplus
as he likes if he does two things—(l) sells enough
assets and puts the proceeds _in the till, (2)
creates a fictitious fund, fed by surpluses,
and pavs for enough of the undertakings ot the
year out of it instead of out of revenue direct.
To double his surplus for the current year all that
Carruthers need do is to sell £2,000,000 worth of
land, and add tothe number of repairs and renewals
and replacements he pays for out of the fictitious
fund (fed by surpluses), instead of out of revenue
direct. The country won’t, however, be any
better off with a surplus of £5,000,000 put together
like that than it would be with a surplus of £ooo.
So long, however, as these fictitious surpluses are
announced, sane, economical government is next
door to impossible. Every concession-grabber in
the country" comes in to get his bite, and the
Treasurer who has been posing on the top ot his
fictitious surplus dare not put the whole show
away by owning up that the surplus is a myth,
and there are no real bites for anyone.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
George’s Job and Joseph’s Job.
A CURIOUS side-light is thrown on the purely
artificial character of J OEY Carruthers’ recent
shindy when one considers the circumstances of
the last Federal election. It happened about
eight months ago, and, though there was a good
deal of disturbance about Anti-Sosh and such-like
matters, none of the present batch of grievances
were heard of then. They hadn’t been invented
at that time. If, as the bounding Joseph tells
the Cornstalk people, they are trodden to-day under
the iron hoof of Federal oppression, they were
similarly trodden last December, and they weren t
aware of it. The alleged wrong and outrage done
them by the collection of duties on State imports
was in full blast then just as it is now, and had
been in full blast for years, and nobody men-
tioned it, just when an effective protest might
have been made. Also nobody felt a penny
the worse for it. The State which the
crazy Joseph Carrgthers says is “on the rack ’
was just as much on the rack then and no
candidate explained to the State its position. It
was in the situation of an alleged martyr who was
being burned at the stake without noticing the
fact. In these days, too, everybody was aware
that a new and highly protective tariff was coming
along, but the bosses of the political machine
hadn’t passed round the word that the utter ruin
of N.S.W. through Protection was to be the
current lie of the moment, so the coming tariff
was scarcely mentioned. There wasn’t even a
Secession candidate put up. The lie of the
moment was to the effect that Socialism was
undermining the pillars of the community, and
nearly a quarter of a million people went to the
poll in their Federal capacity without a ghost of
an idea that they were ruined and oppressed by
wire'netting and such-lilce things. Then only
eight months later the same people were herded to
the poll in their State capacity, and Socialism, the
thing that last December was a devouring monster
which overshadowed all other considerations,
wasn’t so much as alluded to. There is much
more danger of Socialism in State than in h ederal
politics, for the State controls railways, lands,
labor legislation, wages laws, factory laws—in
fact, all the machinery out of which a huge So-
cialistic system might be built; while the Com-
monwealth has no present chance to give Socialism
anything material in the way of a leg up. If the
Federal election had been fought in N.S.W. on
the question of Freetrade, “ Federal oppression,
secession, and the bogus grievance about the col-
lection of duties on State imports, that would
have been understandable; all these things the
Australian Parliament can deal with. If the
State election had been fought on the question of
Socialism and Anti-Socialism that would also have
been understandable; for if the verdict was deci-
sively Anti-Sosh the State Parliament has power
to sell the State railways to private companies,
to abolish Arbitration laws and old-age pen-
sions and the like, and generally to throw
Socialism overboard. But as each tale was
only the election lie of an unscrupulous
political adventurer, the positions were reversed.
The Federal election was fought on George
Reid’s Anti-Sosh lie; if George Reid won he
would get office, and as the Federal authority has
no control over railways, factory legislation, and
the other offices and departments where Socialism
is creeping in with seven-league boots, he wouldn t
be required to really do anything. And the State
election was fought on the question of the tariff
(with which the State Legislature has nothing to
do), the Federal capital (over which it has no con-
trol whatever), and the collection of duties on
State imports (which is exclusively a matter for
the Australian Parliament and the High Court).
Therefore CARRGTHERS crawls back to office
without taking any serious responsibility. Reid s
lie was invented so that he might get to office on
a matter on which he could do nothing but loaf
and collect his salary, because the matters involved
were almost entirely outside Federal jurisdiction.
Carrgthers’ lie was devised on exactly the
same lines. If they had swapped lies
and had both got to office _ then they
would really have had to do things. Car-
rgthers’ friend Reid would have had to move in
the Australian Parliament that the N.S.W. State
Legislature should be allowed to fix the site of the
capital; and should be allowed to import goods
for sale free of duty, thereby establishing a huge
Socialistic State Indent Department ; and he
would have had to demand Freetrade in beer,
sugar, wine, tobacco, and everything else. And
Reid’s friend Carrgthers would have been at
the head of a strongly Anti-Sqsh Government,
and could have shown his sincerity by selling the
State railways to Private Enterprise, and abolish-
ing Arbitration laws, old-age pensions, and all the
rest of the Socialistic machinery. As things
stand, the people of N.S.W. were fooled by two
disreputable politicians. They were invited to
return Reid to do Carrgthers’ job, and Car-
rgthers to do Reid’s job, and even if both men
had been returned the jobs must remain undone
for the simple reason that cavalry is no use at sea,
and even the best fleet isn’t of much account on a
mountain range. It was all very good for the two
disreputable politicians, but it was a very pool
joke to play on the people of N.S.W,
«
Hints from Afar.
Australia can only remain blind to its national
duty these days by wilfully shutting eyes and ears
to the warnings which are writ large in the Arma-
ment and shouted by the winds from every corner
of the earth. Never before in what is known of
the world’s history has a people been so blessed as
the Australian with richness of heritage and free-
dom from attack. And, lost the freedom of tle
past should justify the carelessness of the present,
Fortune adds to its benefits warning upon warning
that we must prepare to guard what has been given
to us so freely. The warnings have so far been
of but little use. But they are continued with
such strange perseverance that those of a trans-
cendental turn of mind might easily find justifica-
tion for imagining that a special Providence
watches over this land, and is resolute that it
shall go in the right path, if timely exhortation
and guidance can be' useful; and, if warnings
continue to be disregarded, those of a practical
turn of mind will be able to find no feeling but
that of contempt for the people who had
so rich a treasure, and carelessly neglected
to provide for its security. Consider the
warnings that to-day is uttering. Newfoundland,
a small British colony, is complaining bitterly
that its just rights have been bargained away to
the United States by Great Britain. The com-
plaint seems to be justified; even responsible
British papers admit that. But Newfoundland is
weak—weaker than it needs to be, since it
takes up the separatist attitude of a Carrgthers
and refuses the shield of the Canadian union;
and the United States is strong. The Mother
Country,” under the circumstances, dare not pro-
tect its offspring. Should it withstand the United
States and war result, the whole burden of the
contest would fall upon Bntam. Newfoundland
itself couldn’t furnish one armed ship, and it *
forces are a few police. The game is not worth the
candle. Newfoundland goes to the wall. In
another small British colony, Jamaica, an inci-
dent recently arose during which a United States
Admiral took up an attitude as if he were dealing
with a disturbed Morocco or a riotous Tahiti.
Against the express wishes _of the British
Governor, and without any obvious necessity he
landed American troops to keep or^er (there was
no British warship near—the warships having


been withdrawn to British waters in accordance
with the new policy of guarding the heart of the
Empire and leaving the limbs to look after them-
selves). The British Governor of Jamaica protested.
But the Yankee had his way, and the British
Government supported the Yankee invader, and
compelled the British Governor to apologise for
trying to do his duty. The United States is strong,
and Jamaica’s help in case of a row would not he
worth a penny. In another small British colony,
Columbia, the Pacific province of Canada, the
white population is threatened with extinction
by a stupendous Japanese influx. It wishes to
keep the State for the British race by excluding
the undesirable Asiatic. But Columbia is a
very weak State, and its wishes count for
nothing, because in case of trouble it could
not put 1000 rifles in the field, or a
single warship on the water. So Columbia
lias to submit to being smothered by the Japanese.
All these are lessons to Australia. When the
time comes—as come it inevitably must—when
Japan offers to Great Britain the alternative of
enmity or free immigration to Australasia, the
British answer will be in part dictated by a com-
parison of the fighting value of Australia and
Japan. If at that time Australia has a fighting
force of 25,000 men, no warships, no shipyards,
no arsenals, no rifle factories even, the answer can,
in the nature of things, be in only one direction,
and White Australia will come to an end. But if
Australia has, by universal service, trained all its
manhood in military or naval tactics ; if it can
pu t in the field, arm and keep armed 500,000 men;
if it has some navy of its own, and can bargain for
more naval help, with the offer of an expe-
ditionary force to uphold the white man’s cause
in Asia, then Britain could, even with purely
selfish motives, tell Japan to go to the devil.
That crisis will come, as surely as will come the
day of repayment for the first and the last
loan, and of all the middle loans between. Nothing
but a miracle can prevent it, and miracles nowa-
days don’t come to the rescue of the shiftless.
The remedy is not abuse of Japan, or of Britain.
It is the preparation of Australia. With courage
nations can command destiny.

The Moderately Protectionist Tanner.
The N.S.W. Tanners and Curriers’ Association
is said to have made a great impression on
Minister Lyne by its frank assurance that it is
quite satisfied with the old tariff. It had all the
Protection it wanted under that old tariff, and
all that it required. If it gets any rhore Protec-
tion, that extra Protection will be shoved on to
an unwilling industry with a clothes prop, and
the industry will accept it under protest, resisting
to the last. All this sounds quite unanswerable,
until the details of the case are looked into. The
big men who boss the N.S.W. Tanners and Cur-
riers Association are, as a rule, partlymanufacturers
and partly importers. They manufacture here and
they also hold profitable agencies for well-known
foreign brands of leather the importation of which
wasn’t seriously hindered by the mild old 15 per
cent. duty. In their dual capacity they do well,
and they have good reason for not want-
ing any change. _ Under the 15 per cent,
duty it is practically impossible for a new
man to build up a business and compete
with the old big firms, unless he has a profitable
foreign agency to help him ; there is a profit in
the tanning business pure and simple, but not
enough profit (that, at least, is how the big men
figure it out). And the new man starting in a
small way can’t get a good foreign leather agency,
partly because he is unknown, partly because the
big firms in the N.S.W. Tanners and Curriers’
Association have already got all the good foreign
agencies. But consider what would happen *to
these potentates of the N.S.W. Tanners and
Curriers’ Association if the duty was shifted up
from 15 to 50 per cent. First, their lazy, easy
importing and agency jobs would vanish. Im-
porting would cease, and their commissions would
cease also. Then some of the foreign firms they
represent might open factories here ; that would
mean competition instead of commission. Finally,
they would have to face much new local com-
petition created by the new tariff, which would
be very good for Australia, but very bad for
the potentates of the Tanners and Curriers’
Association. At present, they reckon things are
nicely balanced, and they don’t want the balance
disturbed. But Australia wants it badly disturbed,
for Australia wants new industries. This country
can make splendid leather, though the importers’
policy of calling any cheap and nasty leather
“ Australian,” even if it be foreign, and any good
leather ‘ imported,” even though it comes from
no further off than Botany, has created an impres-
sion to the contrary. Australia produces such
good leather that it exported over £600,000 worth
in one recent year, two-thirds of it to England.
But against this there is the lamentable fact that
Australia imported almost the same value in foreign
leather. Australia ought to be a vast exporter of
leather and leather goods, but the bulk of its
export business consisted in shipping away raw
hides and skins to furnish employment and wages
and profits to foreign tanners. This is a ridiculous
state of things for Australia, however well it may
suit the combined manufacturers and importers
who form the N.S.W. Tanners and Curriers’ Asso-
ciation. The only real ground of complaint against
the proposed new duties (foreign leather, 30 per
cent. ; British, 20 per cent.) is that they are too low.
For it must be remembered that the Australian in-
dustry has to work under conditions different
from those of any other leather industry in the
world. The tanners who make the leather, the
bootmakers and harness-makers who use it, all
work under awards and trade agreements requir-
ing fair wages and reasonable hours. So do the
butchers who flay the carcases, and the carters,
seamen and others who handle the goods, while
the railway men who carry them are better paid
and treated than those of most countries with which
we have to compete. And all these things have
to be remembered in the making of a tariff. The
Australian tanner has to be protected in such a
way that the humanitarian legislation of his
country shall not operate against him and put his
industry at the mercy of the foreigner, and a 30
per cent, duty may not quite fill the bill.
+
The Evils of Uncertainty.
G. Reid showed a wise political instinct when he
determined to take the tariff “ lying down.” He
recognised that the Foreign-trade-game is up as far
as Australia is concerned, and that it is best to
allow a fair tariff to go through, and thus settle
the question for a lengthy term. But his press
supporters are now forcing him into another
“fight for Freetrade.” He is reluctant, but
seems not to be able to resist the strong
pressure that is put upon him. What interests
dictate that pressure it is difficult to guess, for,
the country having decided upon Protection,
reason seems to suggest that every interest will
be best served by a prompt and decisive settle-
ment of the tariff. The Protectionist Party, rein-
forced by two mandates of the electors, will
accept nothing less than Protection, so that any
Freetrade success in whittling down duties
below the effective Protection point can
only result in delay, unsettlement, and
another appeal to the people on the fiscal
issue. That will be injurious to all in-
terests. If in any particular industry anything
less than real Protection is given, there will be no
assurance that the local manufacturer will take
up the task of filling the local demand. So
supplies will continue to come from abroad,
paying the revenue duty as they come ; the con-
sumer will suffer, and no new local employment
will be given. But with real Protection, local manu-
facture will promptly start; internal competition
will bring prices down to the lowest level compatible
with a decent wage-rate (Australia doesn’t want
the cheapness that conies from sweated labor),
and the interests of consumer and producer alike
will be served. The proclamation of this tariff
has really made it inevitable. The industry which
under its schedule gets 30 per cent. Protection
will never be satisfied with anything less, because
the proclamation is an admission that 30 per cent,
is necessary. Reduce that 30 per cent, to 20 per
cent., and at once a movement will begin for re-
vision. Gr. Reid sees this. The more sensible of
the Foreign-traders see it. Why the Foreign-trade
press doesn’t see it too, and stop its wild howl for
a hopeless movement which can bring disastrous
uncertainty to business, but cannot bring Free-
trade, is a mystery. Perhaps the explanation is
that the Foreign-trade press has, through backing
up Secession politicians, acquired a purely de-
structive way of looking at things.
A Lady Who Is Quite Mad.
A LADY writes from the Far North :
It gets me quite mad when people are so stupid as to
look upon the Far North as a fever-stricken place, only fit
for savages.
Re the Territory and malaria (B. 4/7/’O7).
I do not believe, as far as my experience goes, that
malaria would be serious. I lived the best, or worst,
part of some years on the Gulf, and I maintain the
climate is not unhealthy. In fact, it is, in winter,
one of the finest in the world. It has been likened to
that of the south of France. When I lived there, the
possibilities of the country struck me over and over
again. It is level and well-watered (rivers everywhere) ;
there is a certain rainfall each summer of yards (during
my first summer it rained 3% yards), and the soil is grand.
This country is described on some of the maps as The
Plains of Promise.
I have seen grass grow in the rainy season almost high
enough to hide cattle feeding—this was good grass too.
A few miles inland I got the finest cauliflowers I have
ever seen at Bd. each, and I got a kerosene tin of tomatoes
for 2s.
Anything and everything can be grown there. I have
eaten the country’s grapes, bananas, peaches, and paw-
paws ; and people who know say enough rice, cotton and
coffee could be grown to supply all Australia.
All the rivers are suitable for irrigation—shallow, with
shingle beds, like most of the Maoriland rivers. The Terri-
tory on the coast is exactly the same, but the Roper is
one of the finest navigable rivers in Australia.
The so-called malaria is not prevalent during the damp
season ; it comes during the dry winter months, and it is
peculiarly noticeable that women very rarely have it.
From this deductions can be made.
The curse in my time was not malaria; it was drink,
and very bad drink, also very dear drink at one shilling
a nip.
As for the children born in the North, they are just
beautiful, and lots of them. They grow splendidly, and
they never have croup or colic or bronchitis, as children
invariably have during the Southern winters. And I
used to think it was a blessing they didn’t, as our doctor
was always drunk.
Then as to temperature—it is far cooler than on the
eastern slopes of North Queensland, and is not to be
compared to Thursday Island. Only once did the ther-
mometer register above 100°, and that day we went for a
picnic.
All the year round one can wear white clothes, and yet
on winter nights blankets are very nice.
What a country it might be if'it only had the chance !
There are never any droughts, and what does that mean
in Australia!
The whole trouble is distance. Everything is so far
away from everywhere. What is wanted is a transcon-
tinental railway to any place up there with a good port,
and given that the Territory will be the best part of
Australia.
Bricks.
“T.A.W.” whites :
In its issue of 10th September, under the heading “ &
New Australian Industry,” the S. M. Herald gives another
illustration of its appalling ignorance of the commonest
Australian manufactures, and incidentally affords a person •
named Scott (probably an imported person) an oppor-
tunity of airing his extreme vacuity of mind in regard to
the same subject.
Commenting on the discovery of a deposit of magnesite
at Fifield, near Parkes (N.S.W.), the Herald remarks
“Judging from reports received concerning the area, it
is likely that an important industry ” (i.e. the manufac-
ture of fire-bricks and furnace linings) “'will grow up in
connection with the mineral,” and it endorses the opinion
of the above-mentioned person named Scott thac “ there
is now no reason why Australia should not be able to
produce its own furnace bricks, instead of having to
import them.” The Herald, and likewise the wonder-
ful Scott, are evidently quite unaware that the
“ new " industry to which they refer has been
firmly established in New South Wales for
some years—notably at Bulli, on the South Coast, where
Pendlebury’s works turn out fire-bricks and fur-
nace linings which are pronounced by experts, and have
been proved by exhaustive trials, to be quite equal to, if
not better than, the Gartcraig and Glen Boig fire-bricks—
the two brands of imported bricks which have been most
extensively used in Australia. Pkndlebdry’s fire-bricks
are now exclusively used by the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company, Ltd., both at its smelting works at Port Pirie,
and at the mines at Broken Hill, and are also used in
very large quantities by Wm. Sandford Ltd., Great Cobar
Ltd., Sulphide Corporation, Queen Bee Copper Mining
Company, New Chillagoe Railway and Mines Ltd., New-
castle Gas and Coke Company Ltd., North Shore Gas Co.
Ltd., Babcock and Wilcox Ltd., and a steadily increasing
number of other concerns. Nor has Pendlebury any
monopoly of the fire-brick industry. Goodlet and Smith,
and other Sydney firms, turn out Excellent fire-bricks,
and the industry has also been established in Queens-
land. In fact, in spite of the absurd but hard-dying
craze for imported goods, most of the people who use fire-
bricks, fire-bars, and furnace linings on any large scale
are now following the lead of the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company Ltd., which, up to five or six years back, used
nothing but Gartcraig fire-bricks, but which has now
entirely abandoned them in favor of the locally-made
article. As a consequence, the imported fire-bricks
are being steadily driven out of the market. The
Australian fire-bricks are quoted at from 655. to
755. per thousand, f.o.b. or f.0.r., whilst the cost (in-
cluding a 15 per cent, duty) of the Gartcraig and Glen
Boig bricks is from £7 10s. to £9 10s. per" thousand,
delivered on wharf. Which fact serves to expose the
utter fallacy and essential hollowness of the Freetrade
Herald’s pet assertions that imported goods must be the
cheapest, and that the establishment of local industries
must be accompanied by dire and dismal hardships for
the consumer.
And the whole of the above facts go to prove that as
authorities on Australian industries the S.M. Herald and
the marvellous person named Scott are of very negligible
importance indeed.
It seems to The Bulletin that this writer is
giving way to needless astonishment. The
importers’ papers in Sydney have spent all their
time for so many years admiring the wonderful
importer that they have never had leisure to
learn that Australia possesses some industries of
its own. And even when knowledge was thrust
on them, their rooted conviction that Australia
was nothing and of no account when compared
with such wonderful localities as the Isle of Dogs
(London) prevented the facts making any per-
manent impression on them.

Victoria’s Industrial Appeal Court.
The decision of Vic. Justice Hood against the
employees in the appeal from the determination
of the Wages Board in the baking trade has
accentuated the existing dissatisfaction with the
Appeal Court-one of the alleged improvements
inserted when Iceberg Irvine re-introduced the
Factories Act after it had lapsed. It is somewhat
unfortunate that of the four decisions given by
his Honor, every one should have been practically
in favor of the employers. In the latest case
the Wages Board had raised the minimum
wage for journeymen bakers from 50s. to 545. per
week of 48 hours, and the employers objected.
The question had been thoroughly thrashed out
by the Board, whose chairman gave his vote for the
increase. It was argued for the employees that the
increased wage was nothing to brag about for a
trained tradesman ; that the toil was arduous and
the hours irregular ; that prices of certain commo-
dities and rents had been rising for a long time,
and promised to rise further, and that the general
prosperity of the State justified an increase.
Against this, the employers confined themselves
to proving that there was no specific cause
for any immediate increase in wages, and
his Honor, being a lawyer, took their view. He
wanted sworn evidence in support of the
■employees’ case. There might be general
prosperity or there might not —it hadn’t been
sworn to, and his Honor declined to recognise
prosperity that wasn’t sworn to. There might be
an increase in rents here and there —but there
was no proof that the increase was general
throughout the State. There might be a rise in
the price of certain commodities, but the rise
wasn’t properly before the Court. Mr. Hood
went on to remark that, “though it was quite
possible the employees had a good case, they had
quite failed to prove it —no interested employees
having been called, though employers had given
evidence in the box.” Here spoke the lawyer,
not the man of the world —no employee
who wanted to keep his job, or to have
a chance of getting another if he lost
his present billet, could afford to give
evidence thus publicly. Finally, his Honor pro-
pounded the remarkable proposition that “a
general rise in the cost of living, followed by a
corresponding rise in wages, would mean a further
rise in prices with an additional advance in wages
to follow, and so the matter would go on ad
infinitum. 1 ' 1 To the mathematical and legal mind
this doubtless appears an incontrovertible pro-
position, but to the eye of common sense it
appears pure bosh. Else would the first
original increase of wages ages ago have in-
volved increased prices, and a further rise,
and another increase of prices, and so on, till
by now wages would be possibly £lO,OOO a week,
and bread perhaps £5O a loaf. As nothing of the
kind has happened, it may be fairly decided that
Justice Hood’s statement was a fool of a remark
and not worth calling an observation. If it had
been worth calling an observation, the other in-
ference arises that when wages dropped at the
end of the boom in 1893, prices also went down,
and then wages dropped again, and prices fell
some more, until to-day a man works gratis, and
gets his food and clothes for' nothing. These
things haven’t happened, but plainly they should
have happened. It was largely on the strength
■of this kind of reasoning that Mr. Hood cancelled
the increase which the Wages Board had granted
to the Victorian bakers, and this paper doesn’t
think much of the reasoning.
Charity, Blessed Charity.
Rev. Carr-Smith, Rector of Sydney’s most
aristocratic parish, St. James’s, delivered himself
of a most alarming piece of his alleged mind the
other day at a meeting of the Home for
Incurables
One of the things that struck me with great astonish-
ment when I first came out from England was that every-
body seemed to think that the Government is a sort of
milch cow. Though I suppose it is fair in a way, it is
really a bad habit to get into. I think it is the death of
a great deal of the charitable spirit.
Now if Preacher Smith would climb out of his
English groove a little, and do a think in the open
air, it might occur to him that he has got things
upside down. Here the Government is the
people; and when the Government, which is the
people, takes in hand a question of such all-round
importance as that of charities it is a fine sample
of national self-reliance. It is a case of the
people doing things for themselves instead of
crawling to a few rich folk to do things
for them. As for “ the charitable spirit,”
most of it is a curse. There is a sediment
of genuine goodness at the bottom of it;
but, despite that redeeming feature, it consists
to a great extent of three principal elements—the
professional busybody or charity-monger or agita-
tor who collects the money ; the rich advertising
person who gives the money ; and the arrogant
person of the Pardiggle variety who distributes
the money. That is saying nothing of the humble,
abased, forelock-touching, bob-curtsey person
who receives the aid, if he or she is sufficiently
humble. They are all objectionable characters.
London buzzes with charities like a beehive. Not
counting hospitals, dispensaries, workhouses, and
all the vast mass of parochial relief institutions,
and a whole lot of church doles, there are 246
different charities enumerated in that one capital,
reckoning only those which maintain offices
in the city, and even then leaving out the
more obscure members of the herd. An in-
credible amount of rent and gas and salary
is muddled away by this process, and the
parasites which gather round it would make a
fair-sized army. Yet so helpless and cumbersome
and unmanageable is all this disorganised
which struggles round like a whale on dry land,
that England has been trying for years to decide
how to keep the aged remnants of its world-
famous Light Brigade, immortalised in Tenny-
son’s verses, from dying in the gutter, and how
to ameliorate the condition of the sewing woman
described in the “ Song of the Shirt ” ; and it has
failed in both undertakings. A Wages Board
and an old-age pension system might have done
the work, but that would be depending on Govern-
ment, and would damage the spirit of private
charity. A good many people might perhaps feel
inclined to damn the spirit of private charity.

Japanese Versions of Justice.
Judging by the experience of Korea, Japanese
protection is one of the most hideous misfortunes
that can strike a country. Not content with
seizing the entire government, dethroning
the Emperor, and executing any officials who
decline to accept their advice, the Japanese
have now commenced a systematic loot of
the country. Poor old Korea had only one world-
famous art treasure, the beautiful, priceless white
marble pagoda P’ung-duk, and recently an official
of the Japanese Imperial Household removed it
from the Korean capital and set it up in the
Imperial museum at Ueno Park, Tokyo. The
protests of the Koreans were utterly ignored.
Nor does the looting stop with the art treasures
and revenues of conquered Korea. Some
time ago the owners of the famous “Black and
White” whisky found that a Jap wine and
spirit merchant had appropriated their name
and label. The Scotch firm promptly took
action in the court at Osaka. The pirated
labels were produced, and the Jap merchant
blandly explained that he had appropriated the
“foreign words” because they greatly increased
the sale of his poison. The court decided that ho
was within his rights. It may be a long cry from a
priceless art treasure to a bottle of liquor, but the
utterly incurable corruption of Jap methods
sticks out as conspicuously in the *ne
case as in the other. And it is not only in
Japan that this sort of thievery is practised. The
British and American merchants in China are
vigorously protesting that their trade marks, or,
as they are locally called, “hong names,” are
being appropriated wholesale by Japanese mer-
chants to push their inferior wares. Among the
leading foreign firms in China is that of Car-
lowitz and Co., which, for over 60 years, has
been building up an extensive trade in certain
lines under the hong name of “ Lee Woo.” One
of the firm’s leading lines is toilet soap; the
packages always bear the name “Lee Woo,” and,
by their well-established reputation, find a ready
sale in central and northern China. Some years
ago the firm found that a Japanese soap merchant
named Y. Harumoto, of 90 Kogawa cho, Osaka,
had appropriated the name, and was branding
both his soap and packages with it, and had actu-
ally had the effrontery to register it as his own
in the Japanese official Registry Bureau in Tokyo.
Carlowitz and Co. proceeded against Mr.
Harumoto before the Bureau in Tokyo. The
firm produced official documents from Consuls,
including the Jap Consul-General at Shanghai,
and from the Yokohama Specie Bank, and pro-
duced all manner of evidence to prove that “ Lee
Woo ” was the hong name of Oarlowitz and Co.
and that it had been appropriated by Harumoto.
Also, there was no defence. Harumoto admitted
that he had stolen the name because he found it
increased his trade. And notwithstanding all
this evidence the Tokyo authorities decided that
Harumoto has the right to use the hong name of
Carlowitz and Co. if he so desires. There is
absolutely no redress for the foreigner in the
Japanese law courts, and apparently the British
and other foreign merchants will be steadily
driven right out of China by the appropriation of
their hong names, and the whole foreign trade of
that country will pass into the hands of a set of
unscrupulous Japanese thieves.

Going North.
The movement of Australia’s population keeps
northward, towards those regions in which all the
nigger-loving Tories tell us “ the white man can’t
work.” For the quarter ended June 30 New
South Wales gained 8944 people by excess of
arrivals over departures from South Africa, Tas-
mania, S. Australia, Victoria, Maoriland, etc.—
curiously enough the largest gain was from cold
and wintry Maoriland. And, on the other hand,
it lost 3650 people by excess of departures to
Queensland. New South Wales has been doing
remarkably well in the way of immigration since
the “Federal blight” fell upon it, and but for
that steady drain towards tropical Australia it
would do a great deal better. Merivale, of the
Sydney Chamber of Commerce, may holler
all he knows to the effect that the North
must_ either be filled with niggers or must
remain for ever empty, but, all the same,
ever since the Philp nightmare was lifted in
Queensland the white man has been hurrying
with his pick and shovel on his shoulder towards
the top of Australia’s map, and if he can’t reach
the Territory by any other route he will yet people
it by a process of overflow from North Queens-
land. And in the process of migration he is
further bursting up the silly old lie—which was
really pretty well burst before—to the effect that
the “white man can’t work in the tropics.” As a
matter of easily proven fact, the white man in
the tropics can mostly out-work, out-march, out-
fight and out-live the black, provided he is the
right kind of white man. The trouble is that in
most of the tropical regions the cheap nigger is
plentiful, and it is beneath the white man’s blessed
dignity to work when he has a nigger to toil for
Dreadnoughts for Brazil.

The Daily Chronicle now learns that it is Brazil, and
not Russia, that has placed large orders for warships in
England.... . Armstrong, Whitworth and Co., Ltd., have
already built two Brazilian cruisers and two Argentine
gunboats. —Cable news in Sydney paper, 99/Bj’P7,
Oh ! the building yards are humming
With the roar of industry,
There’s a score of orders coming
From the nations oversea ;
Night and day the ceaseless clamor,
Clash of steel and clang of hammer,
As they bolt and belt and “ damn her”
Into Strength and Majesty.
To the East and South and Westward
Hark ! a warning clear and shrill,
“ Be Prepared ” is still the best word,
“ We’ve a duty to fulfil.”
Chili lacks big cruisers badly,
Argentine needs gunboats sadly,
And an urgent call rings madly—
“ Two more Dreadnoughts for Brazil!”
There’s a headland left unguarded—
“ Plant a gun upon it’s crown ;
See that all the coast is warded,
Every city, port and town.
Revolutions are exciting,
But just now we’re not back-biting,
We have read the mural writing
And we’re buying things, cash down.
“We are buying, stealing, making,
Begging rifles by the heap ;
We, with acres worth the taking,
Mean to watch and guard and keep ;
Monroe doctrines notwithstanding,
We’ve an army trained and banding.
Cruisers watching every landing,
And we won’t be caught asleep.”
Through a door in the Pacific
Comes the sound of argument —
Tumult, babel, roar terrific
As of struggling forces pent.
Cries of “ Wrongs ” and “ We’ve bin cheated
Of our State Rights ! ” are repeated,
And the Monkey listens, seated
In the seething Orient.

him. So the white workman, who is some
authority on the question whether a man can or
cannot do manual labor in a given climate,
doesn’t go to places like India to give an opinion.
And the other kind of person, who does occasion-
ally go to places like India, says, speaking from his
own feelings, that for a white man to swing a
pick and shovel in that climate is impossible.
He couldn’t do it, and that settles the matter.

The Great Freetrade Meeting.
The Bulletin sent a man to look at last Monday’s
great Freetrade upheaval at Sydney Town Hall,
and he tells his tale :
Lured by large and flaming advts. in the Sunday Times,
Herald and Daily Telegraph, I hied me joyously on
Monday night to the Sydney Town Hall, being promised
the following
mOWN HALL!
x THE TAXPAYERS’ DEMONSTRATION.
TO-NIGHT. TO-NIGHT. TO-NIGHT.
ADMISSION FREE. ADMISSION FREE.
Doors Open to the Public at 6.
TICKET-HOLDERS for BALCONIES and PLATFORM
Druitt-street Entrance, 7 till 7.45.
An ORGAN RECITAL by Mr. EDWARD SYKES
from 7 till 8.
Dr. JOHN McDONAGH
will Preside.
Senator the Hon. J. C. NEILD
Speaks till 9 o’clock.
FACTS. HARD FACTS. FACTS.
Mr. NELKEN will give a talk, and he speaks as the
Lawson of Australia. There will be other speakers, and
THE LATEST ELECTRIC PROJECTIONS,
with a number of his own designed views on the
FRENZIED FEDERAL MINISTRY
and
TARIFF.
At 6 p.m. the main front doors of the Town Hall were
besieged by a surging mass of nine souls; but remained
closed. Twenty minutes later the multitude had swelled
to double figures, and the doors were still closed. What-
ever occurred now in the way of a sudden rush of
citizens, I felt I had a show for a fair seat at the Organ
Recital (timed to rage between 7 and 8), so I went away
and sat anticipatively in a pub. Leon Neliien, “ the
Lawson of Australia,” who promised in his Sunday
Slimes whoop to hurl Lyne’s effigy on a white sheet
“ in five different positions,” specially struck my fancy.
I just panted to hear that Nklken ring.
By 7 there were 15 citizens wandering about the steps
of the Town Hall and eight more waiting in the street—
three of the latter being drunk. At short intervals a
beady-eyed little man, who looked as though he might be
Leon Nelken (but who, on the other hand, may equally
well have been Moss Isaacs or Sol Levenstein), dashed
from some haven on the eastern side of George-street,
counted heads, and sped swiftly back again. The build-
ing itself remained hermetically sealed, and presented
the appearance of a mausoleum that was about to be dis-
trained on for the rent. A rumor circulated that Leon
had not been able to raise enough ready cash from the out-
raged taxpayers of N.S. W. to pay E. Sykes for operating on
the organ. I departed for another hour. By 8 the demon-
strators (now some three dozen strong) were resolved
into knots. “ Mishyer Nelken,” said an aged, grey-
whiskered orator from the sidewalk, “ I don’t know, and
don’t want to, but that Johnny McDonagh and J. C.
Neild —my lifelong friends, mark yer all—mean to betray
us, and their own State o’ Noo South, I refuse abserlootly
to believe. If Neild don’t speak I shall be amazed.”
Several people said “ Hear, hear,” and I moved to the
steps, where a couple of prosperous-looking Semites and
a small, slimy Christian in spectacles muttered low and
vindictively. I thus got the view of the intelligent section
of the community on the situation.
There was no doubt the meeting was a frost. Re-
mained to decide who was responsible. On two points all
were unanimous: (1) That they would not vote for
Hughes or Milner Stephen as aldermen any more—the
idea being apparently that this brace had queered the
demonstration through their disloyal niggardliness in not
agitating to have Sykes’ fee paid by raising a mortgage
on the Council’s property ; and (2) that for the rest, Vic-
torian treachery was to blame, coupled with Federal mis-
management and underground engineering on the part
of Bill Lyne, who feared to have himself shown in five
different positions by Nelken. I edged dazedly away.
A grateful whiff of horse-sense struck me as I boarded
a tram at the street corner. “ Freetrade meeting ! ”
said the conductor. “ Freetrade wake yer mean. Why,
blanky old Freetrade’s dead ! ”

Some Maoriland Experiences.
An advance copy of the report of the Maoriland
Department of Labor for the past twelve months
throws some interesting light upon the Australian
Tory’s recent shriek of joy at “ the break-down
of Arbitration” in those parts. For 13 years
the Act had made Maoriland the country without
strikes ; but that didn’t count. There had been
a smash at last. Now this report sets down in
plain words and figures what the smash amounted
to. The Arbitration Court during the year made
awards affecting 59 distinct sets of employees.
There hasn’t been a breakdown in any of those 59
cases. But in just two cases there were strikes.
One “ commenced in the afternoon, and was over
before midnight.” And, apart from that sudden-
ness, so far from the Act and the system break-
ing down, “the company has since been fined
by the Arbitration Court for dismissing men
without notice, and the men were fined for taking
part in a strike.” If that spells break-down,
then the law against murder has broken down
in N. S. Wales because an ex-watchman, turned
burglar, battered an old lady to death lately at
Enmore, and last week was sentenced to death
for it. The ex-watclnnan’s opinion probably is
that the law hasn’t broken down; and even the
fattest and stupidest Australian Tory might fail
to convince him that it has. The other Maoriland
case was certainly worse. This was a matter of
enforcing an award or an agreement. The first
time the slaughtermen were before the Court, the
Court had to decide that there was no agreement
to enforce. In other words, the Arbitration Act
“broke down” because in that case it hadn’t
been applied; and the chances are that a
fire-engine would also be of little use in
putting out a fire if, when it was wanted,,
it was found that it had been inadvertently left
at the station. Moreover, when other lots of
slaughtermen who had made an agreement tried,
the same thing, “the men were fined individually
£5 each for having aided and abetted a strike.
Some have paid the fine in full; some are paying
by instalments to the Labor Department ” —and
they, too, probably have their own ideas about
the alleged break-down of the Act, and the impossi-
bility of enforcing awards under it. In 406 cases
last year the Inspectors believed that the awards
were being dodged or neglected. They proceeded,
got 359 awards enforced, and found that in the other
47 cases the awards were not really being violated.
The Australian Tory who shrieks against Arbitra-
tion —and yet isn’t game to frankly own up that
he favors the only alternative, which is the strike
and the lockout —never mentions those 406 cases.
There is another point, of course. If Arbitration
simply means such excessive wages that industries
are killed, and the wages are not paid after all,
then both the workers and the country at large
would be better without Arbitration. It is 12
years since the present definition of “factory”
was adopted in Maoriland ; beyond that, there-
fore, it wouldn’t be fair to go. Yet it isn’t neces-
sary to go back any further. In 1895 there were
4109 factories and 29,879 workers ; now there are
10,788 factories and 75,310 workers. In all the years,
before this devastating Arbitration Act came into
force Maoriland accumulated 4109 factories; in
the 12 years since the country began to go to ruin,
under the blighting influences of Labor legislation.
and a Protectionist tariff, 6679 have been added —■
6679 factories and 45,431 operatives. N. S.
Wales, which adopted the re-classification of fac-
tories in the same year as Maoriland, had in 1895
a total of 48,030 factory employees ; at the end of
1906 the total had increased to 77,758. In the
last 10 years for which the N.S.W. figures have
been issued, manufacturing employment in N. S.
Wales increased 56 per cent.; in Maoriland, in 10
years, it has increased 103 - 9 per cent. N. S.
Wales, which in 1895 had over 60 per cent, more
factory workers than Maoriland, is now just a
fraction ahead, and, apparently, but for the
assistance from the Federal tariff, it would be
behind. Obviously, N. S. Wales could do with a
little more of the Maoriland blight of Labor laws
and High Protection—and, if it makes it still
Higher Protection, it will be all the better for it.
:
The Boot Polish Industry.
The boot-polish and leather-dressing industry
affords another instance of the quaint tricks of
the foreign manufacturer, and the folly of insuffi-
cient Protection. The new tariff fixes the duty
at 40 per cent, ad valorem, with a 5 per cent, pre-
ference to the Britisher. The old mongrel tariff
fixed the duty at 20 per cent., and the increase to
40 per cent, moved the Argus to moan that the
former duty was adequate; in fact, the natural
Protection was enough even without that. Now,
Spooner and Co. are by far the largest manufac-
turers of boot-polish and leather dressings in the
Commonwealth, and their trade grew steadily
till 1903. Since then it has steadily declined till
the firm now employs but one-sixth the number
of hands it paid wages to in 1902. Also, in 1902, it
bought 5911 gross of bottles from the Melbourne
Bottle Works ; and in 1906 a wretched 903 gross.
Simultaneously the imports increased steadily;
for Victoria they were worth :
1903 .. .. .. £lO,OOO
1904 12,000
1905 15,000
1906 19,000
The chief imports are those of the English Nugget
Co. and the Boston Blacking Co., and the methods
of their competition were simple and ordinary.
The retail price of their stuff in England is 4|d. a
tin ; in fact, they won’t supply the retailer unless
he pledges himself not to sell below that figure.
But when these big foreign firms decided to wipe
out the Australian industry, they sold their stuff
at 3Jd. and then at 3d. per tin in Melbourne, at
2d. in many country towns, and in at least one
town (Horsham) the price got even down to Id.
per tin. This was after paying freight, insurance,
commission, and 20 per cent, duty. Of course,
if the Australian industry is killed quite dead the
price will go up to make good the loss. Mean-
while, as there are only 4,000,000 Australians, the
profits on the trade of 46,000,000 British people
are large enough to pay the costs of the struggle
to ruin the Australian industry. One remedy in
a case like this is to make the duty so high that
even the British profits can’t stand the racket. If
that fails, there is another remedy in the exer-
cise of the anti-dumping law—a law the existence
of which on the Australian statute book does not
seem to be sufficiently well remembered.

Protectionist Sampson, M.P. for Wimmera, said
all he had to say on the tariff and budget in half-
an-hour. Then P. Fysh filled in an hour-and-a-
half in stating much less. Next McWilliams
(Tas.) and Palmer (Vic.) filled in the rest of the
sitting droning wearily to an average of a dozen
members, who took hardly any notice of them.
At one stage the audience got as low as eight;
yet these great orators plodded on, hindering
much-needed legislation. What the House
wants badly is a standing order, providing
that, if a speaker cannot make himself suf-
ficiently interesting to keep a quorum, that
speaker shall stop right there, and shall say
no more during that debate. Under the present
foolish system, if the speaker is so silly, dull,
wooden, monotonous and interminable that his
fellow members can’t bear to hear him, and a
quorum can’t be found to listen to him, the House
shuts up, and the business of the country shuts
up. And only the dreadful bore who made the
trouble should have to shut up.

At the Melbourne Royal Show luncheon, where
the tables were packed with Tories, and Kyabram
and Anti-Sosh sat facing each other, Minister
Ewing had the unthankful task of responding to
the toast of the Federal Parliament. He made
the sad mistake of treating the company with
respect and sympathy, and was repaid by
“ laughter ” and “ interruption.” The Age
report contains the following
Mr. Ewing : There were some matters in regard to
which there should be no differences of opinion, and one
was the future and possibilities of the country. It
depended not only on the land, but on the men. The
class of land was material, but the class of men was
supreme. In the development of their resources they
would like the Government to leave them alone as much
as possible. (Applause and interruption.)
A Voice : That’s it. (More laughter and interruption.)
Mr. Ewing: They wanted to work out their destinies in
the right way, and with the intelligence the Almighty
had bestowed upon them. The Government must give
help.
A Voice : By leaving us alone.
Mr. Ewing : Very well; but if the Government did, at
any time, find some of them situated very many miles
from a railway, and if it offered to build the line, they
would not resent the interference. Each one liked the
interference that suited himself.
For arrant humbug and hypocrisy the interjec-
tions given above, and the general tone of the
meeting, are just about the limit. The Tory
farmer demands with one voice to be “left
alone ” —that is, left alone to sweat his em-
ployees and sell diseased ox, tainted milk, and
so on—while with another voice he pleads
and begs for all sorts of Government help.
During the progress of the Melbourne Show there
was one stream of cadging deputations to the
various State Ministers ; and much of the space of
the papers was occupied each morning under the
heading, “Country Deputations.” The Age on
Thursday had two solid columns of small type,
recording over a score of begging parties and their
attempted raids on the Treasury. All of these well-
dressed cadgers were farmers, and mostly from
prosperous districts, and they asked for things that
would have made the average vegetable John
Blush. One particularly cheeky deputation, from
the Wimmera, asked for a grant to make a road
in the main street of the town ! And these are
dhe people who object to State interference, and
whose only desire is to be left alone.
It is estimated that there are over Eight Million
Acres of land in Queensland now covered with Prickly
Pear. This pest is spreading rapidly, and in another five
years the area will very likely be doubled, unless the
people set to work with Tyree Sprayers to cope with the
plague. All kinds of attempts have been made in the
past without success. The Tyree method commands suc-
cess for the following reasons : —l. The Tyree Sprayers
work at 1501 b. pressure. 2. They throw a foglike spray.
3. They use a minimum amount of chemicals. 4. They
do not injure the ground. 5. The cost of labor is very
small. THE RESULTS ARE CERTAIN. For full in-
formation write TYREE LIMITED, 314 George-street,

Opera House Rickards’ Vaudeville Co.
Glaciarium Ice Skating (last weeks).
The new Theatre Royal (Sydney) produc-
tion is belied by its title. “Her Love against
the World ” suggests crude bellowdrama, while in
reality the author has essayed something in the
nature of a serious romantic play. The devotee
of the “Face at the Window” brand of outrage will
likely suspect he has been sold a gold brick for
the first half-hour of this show ; however, after
that he should be able to sit up and take peanuts
and other nourishment, and in the end go home
feeling quite glad he came. For “thrill” is of
“Her Love,” etc., theessence. The action gravi-
tates between a couple of those European princi-
palities that the geography books don’t mention
—places that own patent medicine names, and a
population that is uniformed in all the hues of a
bloodshot eye—glad regions, within whose borders
no one does anything, apparently, except fight
and make love, and where the common importer
class is unknown, and the export trade (except for
a steady line in the despatch of dead soldiers to
the eternal port such merchandise most affects)
is at an absolute and permanent standstill.
* * * *
The first act (and for that matter every
other act) reveals a sort of wire netting embroglio
in full blast, the leading disturbers of the peace
being Maurice, Prince of Saxonia, and TJlric, the
ruler of an adjacent State. Ulric needs ready
cash, failing which he will have to drop fighting,
file his schedule, and seek work; wherefore he
directs a predatory and dissolute eye at the
wealthy Princess Iris of Idalia. The Yinolia
royalty is, however, completely off Ulric, whose
all-black uniform bespeaks an evil past and an
inauspicious future; and inclines instead to Eric,
Earl of Strathmere (sky blue jacket, sleeves and
cap), who is ranged by Maurice of Saxonia
(kaleidoscope facings, blue motor hat and cerise
trouserings). The main motif running through
the play is the doggedness with which the lady
from Magnesia adheres to the fortunes of the man
she loves. Moments of tense excitement recur.
Again and again it would seem that Eric is down
and out; but always he is afoot before the ten
seconds call, bright and alert and ready to hand
Ulric yet another smashing body blow. In the
fourth round Ulric fails to come up to time (a crash
off stage, like unto the simultaneous explosion
of 14 dynamite factories, indicates that he has
been shot by someone as “a traitor”), and Eric
marries Iris ; whereat all are thoroughly pleased.
* * * *
Eric as portrayed by Harcourt Beatty is an
amazing nobleman. Just as some possess the
dope mania and others the secesh habit, so Eric
has suffered to grow in him a craze for saluting
and shaking hands. Eric shakes hands oftener
and with more gusto than a politician about
election time, while as a saluter he has the
Camden Park tenantry beaten to a standstill.
There is no service on earth, barring the Salvation
Army, whose officers are accustomed to salute bare-
headed ; but in the poor old suffering land of Pneu-
monia, Eric achieves the feat again and again, and
goes unscathed. Eric would salute a Chow who
spoke him softly, and wring with delight the
mendacious paw of an E. News anti-Fed. letter
writer. Gaston Mervale, as Ulric, is an interest-
ing sort of monarch, and the writer was sorry
when he heard him being blown up. Miss Madge
Mclntosh, the new importation, shows restful
restraint in a strenuous part, and makes of Iris
a very attractive young woman. The comic relief
is awful, and should have something lingering
done to it without delay or mercy. Summed up,
“Her Love Against the World”, is mediocre
stuff whose innate foolishness is mitigated by
gorgeous mounting and generally sound acting.
*# * *
“Human Hearts,” at Sydney Criterion,
continues its appeal as “ the sweetest play on
earth ” to the lovers of improbability preserved in
soft, sweet sentiment; and the management has
no reason to contemplate any change of bill at
present.
* * *
“Miss Lancashire, Limited,” at Sydney
Palace, still sings, dresses, and wrecks her way to
a happy ending. There must be a number of
Lancashire folk in Sydney, who, having lost the
dialect themselves, still love to hear it from the
lips of Miss Florence Baines, for there is no sign
of dissolution about the young damsel.
Sydney will learn with joy that fur-
ther open-air concerts of the famous Besses o’
th’ Barn Band are announced at the Cricket
Ground from the 25th to the 28th. The youth,
beauty, and ugliness of Sydney can enjoy the last
strains of these sons of Lancaster at one shilling
per pair of ears.

The superb Clara Butt and Kennerley
Rumford open their Sydney season in the Town
Hall on October 5. The fact that the box plan
will be available on September 26 should “ create
some crowd” round Paling’s, as the Yankees say.
Clara’s contralto is said by some to be that of the
century, and there are fervent admirers who
declare it is the Voice of All Time. Certain it is,
however, that it is a Voice, and the wise will
secure their seats early.
** * *
To fill in a week before “ The Ragged
Earl ” arrives in Andrew Mack’s clothes, “ Arrah-
na-Pogue,” which sprouts eternally green as the
shamrock, fills the big stage at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney). It isn’t, however, “ Arrah-na-Pogue ”
pure and ungarnished ; Boucicault is interrupted
half-a-dozen times while Mack warbles “The
Wearin’ o’ the Green,” and other songs, with a
wealth of light and shade. Miss Jane Kelton is
the Arrah of this revival; but the performance is
not one to stick in the memory. “ The Ragged
Earl” arrives on Saturday night, when he ex-
poses the tatters in his raiment for the first time
in Sydney.
They pour into the Sydney Tivoli fast
these days. The newest-comers are Hayman and
Franklin, Hebrew comedians —one a little man
with a large voice ; the other a large woman with
a larger voice. recall Kolb and Dill, with a
mixture of the inimitable Hebrew who sometimes
partnered them ; and their song-and-story pro-
gramme runs on much the same lines, though it
runs a bit more to song and a little less to story.
* * *
Except that they are tiresomely prolonged
by ceremonious entrances and exits, and curtsies
and recalls, and all the incidental wastes of time
that make two hours in a Town Hall appear
longer than three hours in a theatre—except that
they give the minimum of music with the maxi-
mum of interval, the Clara Butt concerts seem
calculated to satisfy all the demand which
preliminary advt. has created for them. Apart
from the “star” lady, the Butt-Rumford co.,
to be sure, is merely satisfactory as far as it
goes. Nor does it go far. A violinist and a
pianist (other than the accompanist) are two
young men of no pretensions worth mentioning.
The violinist is the more expert executant of the
pair, but even he shows no special reason for his
importation. In Melbourne, as in Sydney, and
probably in every Australasian city where the co.
will appear, a more interesting pair of artists on
the piano and the fiddle might have been locally en-
gaged. This uncomplimentary reflection would be
passed upon any imported comic operaor vaudeville
artist of whom it was true; therefore, in common
justice, the same truth should apply to the make-
weight members of a visiting concert co. The
musical person who brings a new name from a
far-off country meets us on exactly the same foot-
ing as the latest foreign juggler at Rickards’s —
but the point is mostly overlooked in newspaper
criticisms.
* * * *
Mr. Rumford, the husband of Clara Butt,
is the only other vocalist of the co. A tall, good-
looking baritone and a thorough artist, he
would be more to the taste of the feminine public
if he sang always the ballads that are “soulful’
(and in which he is most effective) instead of
making a specialty of serio-comic songs in which
some of his finished vocal art and the whole of his
elegant appearance are thrown away. To the
present writer it is sad to hear a baritone of Mr.
Rumford’s stamp trolling ditties about foxes and
things that should be kept sacred (the songs, not
the foxes) to bottle-nosed brethren of rotund pro-
portions. Some of Rumford’s songs are as inap-
propriate to Rumford as a saveloy in the mouth of
a demigod. *
* * * *
On the other hand, the songs of the sensa-
tional contralto are fully adapted to Clara Butt.
They have organ accompaniments, and they
appeal to the multitude. The imposing lady has
a voice of great range—a voice more remarkable
for strength and freshness than for general rich-
ness of tone. There is little of the basso-prof undo
about Mrs. Butt. The larger half of her
voice is upstairs rather than downstairs; the
quality is not markedly contralto throughout;
the surface is not quite smooth —but the
strength of the voice is remarkable, and the
songstress lets them have it, with her hands be-
hind her back, her chin in the air, and her tall
shapely figure posed all the time. Her style is
declamatory and her selections are after the
multitude’s own heart. At her first concert she
took 10 minutes to be persuaded to grant an
encore number after “Land of Hope and Glory,”
an item from a cantata which appears to
have been written for a large chorus and a
brass band. When the encore was at last
forthcoming, it turned out to be “Kathleen
Mavourneen,” sung with a display of feeling.
The “ feeling ” that the imposing lady imparts to
her singing is as much in the action as in the
voice. In short, Clara Butt and her performance
are melodrama, and melodrama is popular with
the public of this country when it is common-
place. How much more should it be popular
when it is uncommonplace, as in the case of the
contralto who measures 6ft. 2in., or thereabouts '.
* -* * *
“The Bondman” made a further appear-
ance at Melbourne Royal on Saturday, looking
for his brother’s gore. Poor old Bondman !
There’s a moral—or, rather, an immoral—in all
his misadventures. Each one proves, by an acre
of rather stodgy dialogue and a fine scenic sensa-
tion, the futility of taking the Road of
Life with a soft heart, a hot head, and
a ballast of Biblical prejudices. Jason, who
mixes sentiment, silence and sulphur in ill-con-
sidered proportions, gets worse treatment from
the world at large than a ruck-player expects in a
premiership match. He is even treated worse
than the umpire. Michael, who isn’t nearly so-
strenuously mashed upon the beautiful heroine,
but is more businesslike and less Biblical, gets-
the girl and all the nice things appertaining
thereto. The whole play is a moving sermon
upon the inanity of altruism, and a direct incite-
ment to resist that spiritual policeman called
“Your Better Self.” The sermon is preached
more effectively than ever by George Rignold.
He has altered the ending of the second
act, which before was an anti-climax. Instead
of tearing up his marriage license after he had
blessed his mammy and cursed some other blood
relations, he now destroys the papers first, and,
dispensing with the interval of dumb show, curses-
the curtain down with immense effectiveness. His
fine acting galvanises the remainder of the cast
into earnestness. Miss Ross, in particular, flings
aside her usual languor, and acts up to him
with much grace. Even the only Bland olt
doesn’t project himself far out of the picture.
Arthur Styan gives a striking characterisation of
the erratic priest. And Miss Kelly, who is cast
as Ist Callow Girl, and her charming laughter
make a joyous episode in the farmyard scene.
“The Bondman” will continue going back on his
bad resolutions for twelve nights only.
*# * *
“Raffles” went through his exciting ex-
periences on Saturday night at Melbourne Prim
cess’s, and carried the house along at a hard
gallop. Julius Knight shows amazing versatility
-—one scarcely expects the romantic J ulius to
make such a success in a part so far removed from
his usual line of legs and swords and glitter and uni-
form and military pomp. Nine-tenths of the world
love a detective play, and this is rather a good
one. Mr. Julius Raffles is the more convincing,
since the contrasting part of Detective Bedford
(Hubert Willis) is run on mild and subdued
principles. It isn’t played weakly, but rather on the
lines of the real’tec who necessarily obliter&teshim-
self, and doesn’t go round detecting with a torch-
light in one hand and a brass band in the other.
“Raffles” is essentially for the man-actor, and
woman is little more than an occasional and pic-
turesque background, so the new star. Miss
Beatrice Irwin, has little scope for an effective
First Appearance. As Gwendoline Conran,
the adored and adorer of Raffles, she is
hauled into prominence now and again. It
seems as if even a tempestuous and calcu-

lating gentleman burglar can never get on
with his critical work without endangering
the situation by giving heed to his love affairs.
Miss Irwin puts excellent work into the short
space allotted to the leading lady. Judgment is
partially suspended till she gets a part in which
she isn’t so much of a mere picturesque back-
ground, but that part of the judgment which isn’t
suspended is favorable. Miss Elbert Orton, as
Mrs. Vidal (a neglected adorer of the great Cracks-
man), has absolutely nothing to do but look
beautiful and flash her eyes with an occasional
pleading or threatening sentence; and she fills
the part to the limit. Richly handsome and
■gowned to perfection, she makes one more note
in the beautiful picture. Little Dorothy
.'Sydney is vivacious enough to attract attention
.even to her minor part of Lady Ethel, the young
daughter of the country crib that Raffles cracks.
The ladies, chatting over their tea, “explain”
Raffles in the first act, before his appearance. He
is discussed as “One of Us.” Why ! he goes
everywhere, knows everybody, is seen everywhere
(visibility’s a great point with Us), and, above
all, “is the champion amateur cricketer of Eng-
land.” With all that, and an amazing capacity
for burgling cribs, what wonder that Mr.
Raffles has a run for his money and other people’s
diamonds !
*. * # *
“ The Dairy Maids ” carry on their
irresponsible fun at Her Majesty’s (Melb.).
Some lengthy and unnecessary work has
been cut out, and the audience sits happily
through to the furious end—satisfied that it
will have time for the sustaining cafe
supper before the 11.30 lock-out. The first
night was a success, but things run even more
smoothly now after a week’s playing. Miss Fanny
Dango is assured of her triumph from her
first appearance, and drives her team of lovers
even more effectively than before, in their ribbon
reins, to the wild ending of the first act. Miss
Young has quite recovered from her attack of
flu’, and her voice is in its full glory. “The
Dairy Maids ” is evidently bound on a lengthy
run. Its “go ” rises triumphantly above its very
poor collection of song and a suspicion of incur-
able lunacy in its plot.

At Melbourne Town Hall, on September
23, a huge complimentary concert will be given to
Miss Eloise Juno. Twenty-three popular people
contribute to the programme, and the gifted lady
herself will do an elocutionary turn. Scawtch and
merely Australian admirers of Miss Juno are
expected to roll up in large numbers to the fray.
Tickets are 2s. and Is.

“What is this cursed mysteree?” hisses the
villain who makes “The Coal King” memorable
at Melbourne Bijou. And his ma explains
everything by a set of vaccination marks. If
Mad Ann, the villain’s mamma, hadn’t had a con-
scientious objection to calf lymph, these remarks
would have been written in a different spirit, and
there would have been no mysteree, no hero, no
villain, no nothink. So let all earnest students
of the higher drama thank their gods that Mad
Ann had the cdurage of her convictions, and pre-
ferred that her only son should go through
life without lymph. “The Coal King’s”
1! ? t ?° p om P lex for human analysis.
Who the heroine really is, why the hero is
boarded out to an imbecile unregistered nurse,
what the capitalistic coal-man’s true politics are!
what sort of great criminal the villain’s reai
father is. or was- all these points are shrouded in
coal-dusted gloom. The heroine and her pa know
something about her (they allege she is an
heiress), but they don’t disclose their knowledge.
Probably the hero’s mother was too superior to
suckle her own kid, having a share in a huge
income (nothing saps one’s natural instincts like
unearned increment). And since the Coal King
has a family likeness to Spruce Myth, per-
haps he is a Reidite (the play is of ancient
date—about contemporaneous with the exist-
ence of the forgotten Reid party). Any-
how, all these minor considerations are in-
significant beside the heavy vil lain. Everything
about him points to the frightful influence that
capital has upon its possessors. The hero, who
was dragged up in a lowly sphere, is a virtuous
youth. He saves entombed miners, rescuesassaulted
females, and does other noble deeds with grace
and regularity. The villain, who has had all the
advantages of a mansion, a University education,
and a lofty social position, is the long-lost brother
of Beelzebub. The play-smiths have made him
the archetype of fell stage villains. He is the
primordial villain from whom all other heavy
leads have degenerated. He is a theatrical
atavism who throws back with a fiendish
" Ha--ha !’’ to the days before Crummies. Once
old enough to realise the opportunities accruing
from a rich parent and a respected name, he lets
himself go. He wrongfully accuses the in-nocent,
assassinates the unsuspecting, behaves like a
bounder and a bully to his best girl, and hits his
aged mother over the head with a spontaneitv and
precision only discoverable in the savage. There
is no decadent subtlety about Walter Ha-Harford !
Yet had he been educated in a Board school, and
fed on skilly, he might have been a hero. For it
would appear that feeding has much to do with
the making of men’s virtue.
* * * *
The scene in which a corpse is cantered
acrqss the stage is deliciously harrowing—so
realistic that one can almost scent death. But
the living tomb interlude—from which actors
and audience are rescued by the superlatively
courageous hero, who has descended to the bowels
of the earth in patent leather boots and a fancy
blue shirt is not pleasant. It is a horrid exposi-
tion of the mawkishness of the British working-
man under the influence of foul air and bad hymn
tunes.
♦ * » *
Harry Sweeney, who makes his first appearance
as a male melodramatic angel, applies a fine
resonant voice and artistic methods to the im-
possible character. He and dainty Beatrice
Holloway play admirably together in the
meagre love passages. Godfrey Cass, as the
monumental villain, is superb. His ghoulish
mirth, his blood-stirring “ Ha-ha ” whenever he
commits a murder —this alone is worth the price
of admission. But the comic relief might smother
himself in the wet blanket of his humor without
causing any regret.

Melbourne Opera House programme is
re-mforced by twy new items, otherwise it con-
tinues as before. The latest arrivals, Miss Agnes
Hazel, a heavy-weight soubrette, and Michael
Nolan, Irish vocalist, aren’t calculated to make
the fire brigade turn out in haste and pour water
on a burning Yarra. Miss Hazel is plump
and prime (someone says a woman’s prime
is forty !); but her songs are silly, and her voice
is rather raucous. Moike looks as though he
wouldn tdo badly with the gloves. He’s got a fine
long reach. Probably he’d do most things
better than he does a stunt as an Irish comedian.
Another first-class misdemeanant is Edward
Cranston, whose playlets have only one merit—-
Carden Wilson’s capital character studies.
Wdson does his best, but Cranston is a heavy
responsibility to carry. The Molassos still whirl
deliriously, and caper through some quaint by-
play. Eileen Lyons, whose voice is the soundest
soprano heard on the Opera House stage for many
a day, begins to look a trifle tired. The White-
leys are due next Saturday.

“Lady Madcap,” at Adelaide Royal, is a
kind of ghost of a performance. Mvles Clifton is
clearly reproducing Huntley as closely as he can
(which is pretty closely). Cyril Mackay—who
used to “take his medicine graceful” in “The
Squaw Man”—comes into the cast to play an
unnecessary French part that was obviously
written direct for Maurice Farkoa. Maude
Thorne looks as prettily afraid of his over-ardent
love-making as Delia Mason used to be of
Farkoa s. But Daisy Wallace is her own
energetic and original self, and it is all
a bright and breezy show, with 15 hard-
working principal parts in it, and the in-
cidental dancing is a dream. Show week has
brought various other attractions on. The lead-
ing amateurs crowd, thq Appendreena, have played
“ Lady Huntworth’s Experiment,” with the leave
of Mrs. Brough and the coaching of Percy
Walshe, who played in this piece with the
Broughs m the old days. The acting was sound
all round, and brilliant in spots. The rough-
riding Skuthorpe gives buckjumps every evening
close to the showground ; the Town Hall has pic-
tures, with a concert added ; the Hippodrome has
just the same ; the Tivoli has a concert without
pictures. And the Show itself has had a spasm of
wild originality, and is also giving a series of
concerts. In fact, concerts are like a cod’s family
for multitude.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Hiphen . Miss Fanny Dango, our new imported
actress, is everything that her name leads one to expect
The fluffy hair and piquante face suggested by the word
“ Fanny ” are there, while the idea of lightness and grace
conveyed to the mind’s eye by the surname “Dango ” is
amply fulfilled. Her voice Is a minor quantity lout in
up-to-date musical comedy a voice is unnecessary * I saw

hasn’t as much voice as an oyster, but she has heaps and
heaps of white teeth and fluffy hair. And with a modern
audience that goes This is the 20th century, and the sense
of hearing is subsidiary to the sense of sight. Miss Dango’s
strong point is her feet. Indeed they are most ex-
pressive. You could meet those feet anywhere, and you
would always know that they could dance. They could
be disguised in hob-nails, and still you’d pick them out
They are feet whose light you simply couldn’t hide under
a bushel. Miss Dango should prove a great success
though as a Sandow girl she is no great advertisement
for that beefy gentleman.
The High Court has upheld the appeal of the Fitz-
gerald’s Circus people against the Victorian judge who
fined them £650 for giving a cash entertainment on Sun-
day. The situation was this: The entertainment was
“ free ” in the sense that you could get into a certain
part of the premises without paying. Then you met a
collection-plate, and by an adequate contribution there-
unto you could get into the reserved seats. Still, you
could see and hear the performance from the’free
part of the premises, and Justices Griffith, Barton and
O Connor held that this constituted a free Sunday enter-
tainment. Isaacs and Higgins dissented on the ground
that, by this process of reasoning, there might be a speck
of free space in the least desirable part of the house while
there was a charge for all the rest of the building ’• they
held that this made the Sunday law a joke. But the
pious Victorian element (they take their Sunday with
dreadful earnestness in Melbourne) was voted down bv
three to two.
“ Snell ”: The attendance of no small proportion of the
vast swagger crowd at Clara Butt’s first sing-song in
Melb. Town Hall was explained by a remark overheard in
a guinea row : “Sarah’s as deaf as a post, you know but
of course, she had to be here, poor dear.” It is felt bv
everybody who is anybody that to be absent from a
tremendous affair of this kind is to invite a suspicion that
one is “ out of it ” socially, and there are such a lot of
fairly rich people who can’t afford that. Judging by the
manner in which programmes were flaunted on the
streets and flourished in trams and trains after the con-
cert, there was more in letting the common people know
that one had been to hear the celebrated Butt at one
guinea, half-a-gui-nea and five shillings, than in actually
hearing her. i even saw well-dressed people scrambling
for scattered programmes on the Town Hall steps as the
crowd was leaving, and assumed it was with the intention
of deluding envious outsiders into the belief that the pos-
sessors of the programmes were patrons of high-price
music, and blow the expense ! 1
Pr T “ The lion which has k »led three
men should be firmly invited to attend its own funeral ”
(B. 5/9/’07.) And yet, if a greasy individual armed with'a

den and asked you to jump through hoops and things I
venture to say it’s only what you’d do yourself. Per-
sonally, I hold that people who so “ tame ” a lion that it
gnaws someone whenever it gets a chance, would be
much better employed subduing woodheaps with an axe
In any case, there’s no need to slay Leo ; those amateur
Daniels who don’t yearn to die with their boots on can
accomplish their desires by carefully remaining outside

poses to still keep the lion in a cage. On the whole this
paper thinks it was more merciful than that.] ’

time when the Royal Comic Opera chorus could have
supplied a score of bouncing beauties who would have
done credit to Miss Pyechase’s athletic branch, notably
when The Old Guard ” was first produced. Chorus
girls bulked large in those nights, but of late the tend-
ency is decidedly towards the small feminine person. Is
this because the Australian male is partial to the pocket-
sized charmer, or because he is so fond of the large-
limbed beauty that he grabs her and marries her almost
as soon as she is produced ?
MISS AMY CASTLES—HER LATEST
PHOTO.
.‘■J.A.C.”: The late William Horace Bent —to the
public he was Horace ; to his pals in the “business,” in-
variably “Billy”—did not come from Geelong (B.
12/9/’O7) ; he was a native of Windsor (N.S.W.). His father
migrated to Geelong very many years ago, hence the
impression, pretty widespread, that Billy was born in the
dead town on the shores of Port Phillip. Billy was
alyvays in the burnt-cork industry, and was possibly the
cleverest minstrel comedian we have ever had in Aus-
tralia. His humor was irresistible; but he was an
artist in “black” only, not in “white.” Once
or twice he essayed comic opera, but was far
from a success. He was an educated man, and a
classical scholar. He could fluently quote liis baptismal
namesake—him of the Odes and Satires. He was a
hypochondriac, although, like most hygienic semi-
cranks, he usually enjoyed robust health. If anybody
had anything the matter with him Billy was sure to
have it too, and in a more aggravated form. On one
occasion a friend gave him some pills to try: “ How
many are a dose?” asked Billy. “Two.” “Then I’ll
take six.” The similarity in name once caused him to
be mistaken for a still more eminent comedian. One
morning Harry Leston was awakened in a Melbourne
hotel by an awestruck menial who, in a hushed
tone, announced that the Minister for Railways desired
to see him. Immediately afterwards the redoubtable
Billy burst into the room. When I first knew W.H.8., 28
y,ears ago, he was of almost too irreproachable respecta-
bility, hut of late years he went rapidly down the hill.
Not long ago, when he was particularly down on his luck,
a would-be funny man suggested to him that they should
embark in a theatrical enterprise on a large scale. “ Yes,”
said Bent, “ with your wit and my wealth we ought to do
well.” Some few years ago Harry Rickards gave Bent
a benefit, the proceeds of which were doled out to
him in weekly instalments, for fear that all might go in
one wild “jag.” In his palmy days, at the time of the
Philadelphia Exhibition (1876), Bent went to America,
and made quite a hit there. When he returned he was
intensely Amurrikan. One day standing outside the
Opera House in Bourke-street, Melbourne, were “ Jim ”
Kitts and George Leopold. Kitts was reading a Boston
newspaper. To them approached Billy: “Hello, Jim,”
he said, “ I see you’ve got a paper, from Hum ; I dunno
how it is, but I never get a paper from Hum naow.”
“Well, that’s strange,” said Leopold; “there’s a mail
three times a day from Geelong.”
Mrs. Brough returns to the stage next month to play a
part in the comedy of “Brewster’s Millions,” under J. C
Williamson’s management. That night J.O.W. had better
see that the roof is nailed down. When an Australian
audience resolves to really express its feelings at the
return of a beloved favorite it is rough on badly-nailed
roofs. Lily Titheradge, remembered as the brightest
plumpest, and most natural of boys in “Two Little
Vagabonds”—she was the other boy, not the Cockney
with the cough—appears in the same play.
“S.S.” : “ The Spring Chicken ” returned to Melbourne
a vastly improved rooster. The fine feathers which make
fine birds were a little tarnished perhaps, but the chicken
was a more sprightly bird, arid much more obviously
game. The improvement was in detail. Miss Morell’s
listlessness was gone—a listlessness that sat ill on a
frivolous spring songster with the stir of the wattle-time
in her pagan bones. Lauri had toned his giddy fatman
into the picture, and was a more harmonious middle-class
roui in a red vest. Leslie’s grotesqueries as the
sympathetic waiter (surely an inspired caricature of
Bernard Shaw’s delightful servitor in “ You Never Can
Tell”), were miles ahead of the earlier efforts—more
fanciful and quaint and better sustained; and his
extravagant dance had developed into a gem of ludicrous
absurdity in stride and posture. There, was a notable
loss of prettiness in the abounding girls, but this was
morethan atoned for by an engaging spring sprightliness.
t)n the whole I found this comic opera very expressive in
Its own melodious way of an engaging quality of human
cussedness, and it’s seldom one can say that of a latter
day com. op.
“ Star ” : It is quaintly characteristic of the Melbourne
dady-bred critics that the imported damsel, Miss Fanny
Dango, should receive a gush of enthusiastic apprecia-
tion for her work in “ The Dairy Maids,” while the little
local product, Connie Milne, has a line or two of common-
place praise thrown at her for a much more commend-
able performance. Even the Aob has not yet acquired
anything of a Protectionist tone in its attitude towards
the native article outside the factory, the farm, and the
foundry ; and its dramatic writers are always more ready
to squander glittering superlatives on an “ English
artiste ” than on a mere Australian actress. This is pre-
ference in art, and it works out badly. The advent of
Miss Fan Dango was heralded with such a blaze of press
trumpets that one naturally looked for exceptional
talent, a personality, and some original points, and Miss
Dango provided the only disappointment of the first pro-
gramme. She is nice, but her particular qualities are the
kind that could be developed in half-a-dozen of the
brighter chorus girls, if they had similar oppor-
tunities. In a country where the boards are over-
run with nice girls, mere niceness, accompanied with a
little dancing ability and a little voice, isn’t excuse
enough for bringing a young lady so many thousand
miles. That s how it strikes me ; Miss Dango is too far-
fetched.
“ Ruru ” (M.L.): I knew something would happen. A
girl can’t go concert-touring with a name like Myrtle
Mcggy without the comps., sooner or later, making a
bungle of it. An Auckland paper heralds the Australian
pianist as Myrtle Muggy. Our Herald seems a bit shaky
on names. It announced Apollonia Basche as Louie
Basche, but that was not hing to calling a poor girl Muggy.
Walter Baker, back in Australia, looks rather the worse
for his health excursion. He went to rejuvenate, and
returns looking old, thin, and grey-faced, a limping
victim to rheumatism. It will probably be a long time
before Walter faces the floats again, but his absence has
brought to many people a knowledge of his ability and
usefulness, which his frequent appearances had failed to
d°- When an actor was wanted for the part of Jason in
The Bondman,” a part Baker would have filled admi-
rably, manager Holt had to fall back on 70-year-old George
Rignold—a hint that Bakers are scarce.
“ Spring ” : The most novel and amusing “ turn ” that
has been given in Sydney for some time, with the excep-
tion of “ A Warning to Women,” is the Bag Act by the
two ourang-outangs at the Zoo. The monkey clan is not
amusing as a rule ; it mainly devotes itself to satisfying
its abnormal craving for peanuts, making grimaces, and
nea hunts. But the two ourang-outangs belong
to a high order of knoek-about comedians. Their
cage is a large one, with two small trees in it
lhe trees and an ordinary corn-sack constitute the props.
Ihe busmess begins with the attempt of the male to
climb into the bag while suspended from the tree by one
hand. Failure results in a tremendous fall on the
thick straw below. He arises, rubbing his tummy
Then he staggers about the cage, and finally sinks in pre-
tended exhaustion on the floor. Rising again, he makes
desperate efforts to dive into the bag on the floor. Hav-
ing succeeded, he turns about 16J catherine-wheels in the
bag around the cage. Then he peeps out to assure the
audience that he is still alive. All this time the lady
monkey has been sitting around boredly on her brief tail
and glancing occasionally in disdain at the old man’s
efforts. The old man throws the bag at her as a hint that
she must do something to earn her salary. She goes
aloft and the old man follows. She gets half way
into the bag, and he to whom she has been joined shoves
her the rest of the way, at the same time adroitly
hooking the corner of the sack on to the end of a pro-
jecting limb. Then he twirls the sack round and round,
until his dame is tied up like a plum-duff and suspended
in horror from the tree. The husband monkey then
bangs the sack and its load vigorously against the tree-
trunk, and finally pulls the corner of the sack off the
limb, and allows his sweetheart to flop down with a noise
L lke a J at man fal ling on a sick cat. She scrambles
hurriedly out. They both do a couple of somersaults,
and the performance ceases for a few minutes.
‘‘ Billy T.”: Meynelland Gunn are bringing a shipload
of ballet girls to Australia for one of their forthcoming
comic-opera productions. Will some constitutional
expert say how the contract labor clauses of the Immi-
gration Act apply in a case of this kind ? Australia has
hundreds of ballet girls, and the raw material for thou-
sands more. Visiting managers declare that the ordinary
Australian girl can be captured and converted into a
serviceable high kick and high C specialist in a space of
time that is usually employed in teaching the young
cockney female to distinguish her head from her heels.
Yet here we have a firm importing a whole ship-
ment of spring goods made in London—bringing girls
to Newcastle, so to speak. The Act does not apply to
dramatic or operatic artists, but the ballet girl is only a
laborer in the artistic vineyard, and the ballet, as a fine
field of industry for the Australian girl, and a first aid to
matrimony, should be reserved for the native youth. If
there is no law' to shut out the cheap foreign competitor,
there ought to be, and I hope the top Lyne will instantly
bestir himself in the interests of the front row. If not,
it is up to the Australian ballet girl to kick.
“ Cockaigne ” : A new series of books called “ Stars of
the Stage ” includes Beerbohm Tree, who has some con-
nection with the Australian stage, in having been con-
cerned with J.C.W. He will be here in a year or two.
His name is Herbert Beerbohm, and he acted as an
amateur under the name of Tree. He played a subordinate
part in “ Hamlet ” when Hamlet was taken by luckless
Frank Cates, remembered in Australia. As a professional,
Tree first made a kind of London success as Joseph Sur-
face. He was at home as a German detective to Willard’s
Jim the Penman. Then he bounded to the star position
in “ The Private Secretary.” Next came the sharp
change to Macari in “ Called Back.” The public felt they
were in the presence of a great actor—as such things go.
During the run of “ The Private Secretary ” Mrs. Leigh
Murray felt her petticoat slipping off before she could
make her exit, but she managed to edge to the side-scene
and kick the garment out of sight, not wholly unob-
served by the audience. Shortly afterwards the actor
known as Primrose Hill entered with “ Has a lady been
here? I thought I saw' a pettieoat.” Then the house
smiled a great smile.
“Star”: “Robin Hood" is a poor play, pretentious,
platitudinous, and badly constructed. At this date, one
may inquire with much weariness if we have not had a
great deal too much of the device of tow'ing the resource
ful hero out of a tight place by his hasty and almost
miraculous swapping of his identity with some old crone
or hoary male superfluity who happens to be hanging
round. I was hurt to find this worm-eaten dramatic
chestnut dragged into “ Robin Hood ” after it had done
service in three recent melodramas. In “Robin Hood,”
the device is badly worked, too. The author exposes h’is
machinery with the incompetence of an amateur. The
aged dame whom Robin is to impersonate later is obvi-
ously skull-dragged into the play for the purpose of being
impersonated. There is no other use for her. She ap-
pears the moment before ; she disappears the moment
after; and her whole make-up—hqr stoop, thick hair,
covering-hood, etc.—are deliberately devised to assist
the deception.
“Silica”: I’m still pretty hazy about the whole per-
formance, but I’d like to tell you as much as I remember.
In place of the ordinary concert at the conclusion of our
annual Scotch celebration, we decided to run a theatri-
cal show. Thompson said he had been on the stage,
and when he proposed “ Rob Roy,” we bubbled over with
enthusiasm. When the great night came, w T e felt nervous.
Thompson said he’d fix us up, and later two strong
men staggered into the dressing-room, bearing a
box of liquor between them. We worshipped Thomp-
son at that moment. The curtain hurtled up,
and the piece went full speed ahead. Such life !
Such movement! Such vim ! The audience cheered like
fury. We felt the glow of art pulsing through our veins,
and we drank heavily in the wings. Another cheer from
the assembled multitude. We felt the people had recog-
nised artistic worth, and we drank to their prosperity.
Then we drank to Thompson. The scene in which
Mac Stuart had to simulate intoxication was a master-
piece of acting. Mac was so natural, so true to life :
there was not a suspicion of the part being overdone.'
Bailie Nicol Jarvie was going so well, and the people
were so delighted, that Thompson sent for more liquor.
Saunders, Wylie and Jobson brought it in, but by
some crass blundering, they lugged it on to the
stage. The audience huzzaed madly. Not to be
outdone, we cheered in response. ‘ On went the
drama with a whoop. The Dougal Oratur had to be
driven on to the stage W'ith threats of violence when his
call came. Then he wouldn’t come off, and his interpre-
tation of the unkempt, irreclaimable Celtic savage was so
enthusiastic that the other members of the co. feared
for their personal safety. Ultimately a squad of soldiers
with fixed bayonets removed him, and cast him into outer
darkness. We drank long* life to the soldiers. The
military forces pledged us in return. Before the foot-
lights Sir Francis Osbaldistone had a subdued altercation
with the prompter (it was heard in the street), and Mr.
Vernon behaved in a manner unbecoming an English
gentleman. Finally, Rob Roy was captured.' The stalwart
outlaw was required to throw the posse of weakling
bassenachs in all directions. He overdid it, and threw
two of them into the audience and one into the wings.
They' swarmed back in fury, one saying that Thompson
was drunk, one alleging that Thompson had owed him
10s. for two years, and one asking Thompson to come out
and be killed. The teetotal scene-shifter deftly let the
drop-scene fall. I believe it rose again, but I cannot say
for certain. I have a confused remembrance of exits and
entrances, of mighty cheers, of going round the stage on
* u urs ’ a a?s ney er seemed to be empty, and
of shadows and far-away voices, and then darkness.
Asiatics and Europeans are not the only
incompatibles. Foolishness and D.C.L. Whisky
are just as hard to blend. That is why s 6 many
Sydney electors indignantly rejected Carruthers
and his political tomfoolery. They viewed the
political horizon through the clear mental atmo-
sphere induced by the amber glow of D.C.L.*
A DRAMA OF LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Behind a bush-girt granite rook
Young Jacky Jacky sat alone.
He did not kiss a raven lock,
No tender verse did he intone,
No rhymes for “love” he sought, and yet
His senses all on love were set.
The sun went drifting down the trees,
The jackass guyed the dying day.
Across the dusky native’s knees
A large, well-seasoned waddy lay.
With this stout club in tenderness
He meant to deal a fond caress.
The maiden came. No word was said.
The lover whispered not nor sighed—
He bashed the lady on the head,
And bore her off, his chosen bride.
And so arose with later stock
That telling phrase, “ To do a knock.”

A dry spring has again put Sydney on
short commons as regards water. There is a
great deal of spare water in the Cataract reservoir,
but the Joey Government persisted, against the
warnings of the Water and Sewerage Board, in
filling the new dam before the dense vegetation
was cleared away. As a consequence it got the
dam filled a little sooner, but the water is useless,
poisonous, undrinkable, contaminated by masses
of vegetable decay. And there is no possible
means by which the water supply can be divided
up and the dirty water devoted exclusively to the
supply of Joseph and his colleagues and sup-
porters. So poetic justice is impossible, and
with abundant water on hand Sydney totters on
the dry edge of famine. And Sydney had looked
forward so confidently to a copious and reliable
water supply when the boasted Cataract was
finished ! But then it didn’t know the muddy
blundering of Joe.
THE WAY OUT.
The petitioner in one of the divorce suits on this
month’s list is 71 years of age, and his wife is 69. They
have been married over 45 years .—Daily Paper.
DEATH : “ If you'll only wait a little longer I'll
fix you up."
The S. M. Herald, the other day, placarded
theresultsof the N.S.W. musketry course—“ The
Defence of Sydney : The State's Best Shots.” It
is Sydney, Sydney, always Sydney. The poor old
paper seems to imagine that the riflemen from
Bulli to Broken Hill, and from Cobram to Colla-
rina, only practise shooting so that, at the first
sign of trouble, they may flock to Sydney and die
fighting for the security of the Herald’s door-
mat.
Sydney City Council is setting a bad
example. One of the evil practices of Commerce
is the sale of old and condemned houses to the
jerry builder, who uses the material, with the dirt
and germs of ages clinging to it, to start new
buildings on their unwholesome career. The
Sydney City Council resumed Athlone-place on
the simple and sufficient ground that it was unfit
to be a dog’s habitation, and if there is any collec-
tion of timber in N.S.W. which wants to be
burned, and any collection of bricks which re-
quires ardent disinfection, the ruins of Athlone-
place are those collections. Yet a sale of the
material is announced, and the man who is putting
up a mansion beside the harbor may have the
ghosts of Athlone-place built into his roofs and
Walls without the least idea of what he is in-
heriting.

“Two Seas” : The faith that moves
mountains is horrid unbelief compared to the
faith that moves the ordinary bald-headed citizen
to invest his spare half-crowns in alleged hair
restorers. Even the hairless dome of millionaire
Rockefeller, and the lightly timbered aspect of
King Ned’s front elevation, fail to convince the
bald-headed dupe that things without remedy
should be without regard. He continues to “ rub
it in ” hopefully at 2s, 6d. a time. So fatuous is
his belief in miracles that he will hail the
few vestiges washed up on the shore of his
forehead by the receding tide as the ad-
vance guard of a new fleet of hair. Even
when one solitary spear of thatch is
left like Casabianca on the blooming
deck, or that other historic mug, the
Roman sentinel who fried at the gate
of Pompeii, the hair-restorer lunatic
greets it as the first blade of a new
spring crop. I know of only one man
who made a recovery from this madness.
He had a “slight down” left on his
cranium, and proceeded to nourish it
into a tall harvest by a much-advertised
restorer. After the sixth bottle the down
disappeared entirely. “ Thank God ! ” he
said. “Now there is no hope, and I
shall be saved much expense.” His
gratitude prompted him to write to
the proprietor of the last specific
thus : “Dear Sir, —I have used six
bottles of your Hair Manure, and
am glad to say that it was most
successful ” (here he turned over
to the next page to give the fakir
a shock) 11 in removing all ray
superfluous hair. I shall be glad to
recommend it as a first-class scrub
eradicator.” But the artful proprietor
declined to “turnover,” and just published
the first page, and my enraged friend is now
reminded every time he uncovers his glistening
minaret that he gave a written testimonial to
Bloggs Infallible Hair Manure.

“ Sfcrawhalian ” : Amazing the ignorance
of Maorilanders in regard to Australia. Have
known a young M.L. female (apropos a contem-
plated trip to the Commonwealth) state that she
intended visiting “Melbourne, Victoria and all
the other suburbs of Australia.” Also, once
heard a he-Invercargillite tell a Tasmanian
that his aunt lived “ either in Tasmania or a
town a few miles distant.” Questions such
as “Do you belong to Melbourne or Vic-
toria ? ” are not infrequent, while deplorable
ignorance prevails respecting Carruthers,
some holding that he is a disease and others
that he is the name of the principal lunatic
asylum. The general impression gleaned
from the Foreign-trade papers which reach
M.L. is that the Commonwealth of N.S.W.
isn’t a fit place to live in anyway.

“ Wusslean” : In a dead little Vic-
torian town the owners of the adjacent big
estates recently gave a haughty hop. A
statuesque policeman, with a mixed liquid
cargo slightly above his Plimsoll mark, was
engaged to flick curious common folk off
the doormat. This mountain of flesh and
pomp was presently approached by a dame
who, with the grace of a true Lady Bountiful
(beloved by the villagers, vide the British
Workman), made him the following offer—
to wit, one cheese cake. It was scorned.
Drawing himself up majestically, he replied
with a dignity that would make a Jeames de
la Pluche weep with shame, “Thank you,
madam, I don’t really require it; I get suffi-
cient to eat at home.” Then turning to
me he said, more in sorrow than in anger,
“ Some people would make a sporting offer of
one peanut to an elephant.”
There is a mystery hanging round St.
James’s Anglican Church at MooneePonds (Vie.),
and the congregation doesn’t know whether to be
sad or joyful about it. A while back an ex-curate
of the edifice, out of the fulness of his pocket,
presented it with a brazen cross', which the
minister, without consulting the “vestry,”
planted on the altar, and dedicated. St. Jim’s
being Low church, some of the worshippers were
shocked, and talked of the Crimson Female,
idolatry and other dreadful circumstances, while
others threatened to take proceedings under the
Trustees and Vestries Act and have the building
disinfected. The uproar was at its height when
some casual person removed the cross in the night
and said nothing. And now, as before remarked,
nobody knows what to do. Sometimes they think
it a matter of sacrilege, and want to give the
malefactor seven years; and then when they
think it over they want to give the malefactor
seven blessings, and hope he got a good price from
the second-hand dealer for the emblem of the
Pink Lady.
A lonely female in the Ballarat district
burnt down a stable the other day, and explained
by letter that she did it just for a bit of excite-
ment. It Was such innocent excitement com-
pared to that of the woman with the tale of out-
rage that The Bulletin suggests she be forgiven,
and that a public subscription be taken up to sup-
ply her with another stable and a tin of kerosene.
If lovely woman must have a vent for her bottled-
up feelings a stable or two don’t really matter.
FALLEN IN HIS OWN PIT.
“ When you asked Pa for his consent, did you
tell him that fib about your salary ?”
“ Yes; and he borrowed a sovereign on the
strength of it.”
Smithers, S.M. (which apparently stands
for Skimmed Milk), presided in the Glebe
(N.S.W.) Police Court, the other day, when
Patrick Adams was charged with selling milk
that was 174 P er cent - water - -After P afcri 9 k had
been found guilty, this list of previous convictions
for the same thing was put in
Glebe Police Court, in 1904, 20s. ; Newtown Court,
1904, £2: Glebe Court, 1905, £3, £lO, £2O; Balmain
Court, 1905, £2O ; Glebe Court, 1906, £25 ; Glebe Court,
February, 1907, £7 10s., with costs in each instance.
Thereupon, a £25 fine not having been sufficient
to break Patrick Adams of his playful habit,
Smithers, S.M., imposed one of £2O; and if
Smithers, S.M., continues to run down the scale
like that, then six months hence Adams is liable
to find himself dismissed with a caution. This
paper begins to have an idea that in the
interests of the Australian baby it may ee
necessary to get through a Bill to deal
with Skimmed Men on the Bench as well
as Skimmed Milk in the can. Then, if an old-
offending milkman has been fined £25, and hasn t
been cured, and if Smithers tries a £2O fine where
a £25 one obviously wasn’t enough, it will be
Smithers that will be brought up charged with
having supplied skimmed justice, the same being
not of the nature, substance or quality that tne
case called for.

A society item from Tingha (N.S.W.) :
The social function of the year up Tingha way is the
Feeding of the Dead—an annual Chinese Pagan festival.
This like other Chinese shivoos, is the occasion for a cheap
spree for Tingha’s social top-notchers and anti-Soshers.
To receive an invitation to this festival is considered a
very great honor indeed. A great feast is spread in front
of the Joss-house, and a track of stinking Chinese candles
lit, presumably to guide the resurrected John irmm
the cemetery to the scene of the banquet. After the
dead Chinamen have satisfied the inner ghost, the afore-
said anti-Soshers slip on the vacated nosebags, and pro-
ceed to make gorgeous beasts of themselves, to the great
amusement of some two or three thousand vulgar
Socialistic spectators. A well-known person invariably
takes the pork-bun for being the most gorgeous and pic-
turesque glutton. The ceremony concludes with the
distribution and absorption of Chinese liquor, called sam
sue. The company then retires, singing ‘ For Hes»
Jolly Good Fellow,” accompanied by an unearthly din of
Chinese music. The man who gets honestly drunk on
good old Irish or Scotch, with his own money, is not con-
sidered any class at all up in these parts.
Maoriland statistics show that, m the cola
and virtuous “ Dominion,” the death-rate among
natural children, as compared with that among
children born in wedlock, is as 17 to 7. Of every
hundred kiddies born without marriage-lines, 14
die, and eight or nine of the deaths are sacrifices
made on the gory altar of Mother Grundy.

The flappers’ dance has aroused what is
alleged by Melbourne Aegus to be a “parental
protest.” The Parents’ National Educational
Union has held a confab with the Vic. secondary
teachers as to the excessive dissipations of school
children during working months. The parents
and teachers reckon that champagne and late
hours are bad, and they suggest indefinite re-
forms. After a good deal of rambling talk from
parents, it was a Miss who hit the nail fair on the
top end by speaking about “ the folly of dances
which lasted far into the night, and were often
without proper supervision by chaperones. -Lake
beer and Bridge and pet lions, flappers’ dances are
all very well in strict moderation, but they are
certainly apt to cause damage when they go over
the limit. Flappers, boy and girl, are swirt
enough at aping their elders’ bad little
ways. Flossie goes up the tower with
Bertram, and comes back smelling
of cigarettes ; and Mary, who from
her name should be quite a guileless
damsel, helps young Pete to cart
a couple of chairs out into the
darkest recesses of the garden, down
by the lily-pond, and there sits
out twelve dances with him-who-
ought-to-be-in-bed. The morning
after a flappers’ dance is liable nowa-
days to show quite as suggestive a
state of affairs as the dawn that fol-
lows a grown-up shivoo. In the chill,
grey sunrise the tracks of youthful
feet in strange,' unchaperoned places,
and the close proximity of the eight
holes which remind you that the chair
is a quadruped and that two chairs
equal one octopus, suggest that the
peach-bloom of youth is being violently
rubbed off. And, when it comes to a
man-child attending “60 dances and
matinees out of a total of 100 days, it
would seem that the education of the
youth in question must be shamefully
neglected, particularly in the matter
of mannish sports and pastimes. There
are surely few more disagreeable names
than that of “ dancing man. If the young male
person waltzes, he should take the floor as an
amateur, not as a profesh, bred in an atmosphere
of skirt and flirt and cheap perfume.
As indicating the reckless generosity dis-
played by some mistresses towards their domestic
helps, the following extract from a lady’s letter in
S. M. Herald (4/9/’O7) is interesting
Someone suggested to me that I demanded too little
and offered too much. So I tried again. This time I
advertised for a nurse and needlewoman—left out the
“lady" duties—take my baby out in pram., put her to
bed at 5 o’clock, mend or make baby’s garments. Hours,
1 till 6.30. One Sunday in month off. Afternoon tea and
dinner. Wages, ss. Each woman that came seemed most
anxious to be engaged. And it really was difficult to
decide which one to take, for they all seemed excellent.
Unfortunately, I let my heart get the better of my head,
and engaged one who.had just arrived in Sydney from Eng-
land. She looked so fresh and wholesome, and almost
begged me to take her.
The lady of the generous heart and weak head
then points out the ingratitude of the nurse and
needlewoman in accepting another offer where an
advance was sprung on the five bob. How,
assuming that a nurse, etc., at this munificent
wage indulges in the luxury of a bed at, say, 6d.
per night, and allows herself 3d. for breakfast on
six mornings in a week, how in Hades is she going
to pay the heavy duty on the motor-car and
semi-grand piano which the daily papers assert
are becoming so popular among the working
classes ?
THE BLESSINGS OF POVERTY
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Eev. I. Carr-Smith, at the annual meeting of the Home
for Incurables, Sydney, September 6, 1907 : “ One of the
things that struck me with great astonishment when I
first came out from England was the general inclination
to lean on the Government for assistance. It is a bad
habit to get into. I think it is the death of a great deal
of the charitable spirit."— D.T. report.
It struck him with astonishment,
The quite deplorable extent
To which we lean on Government,
When first he came from Britain 1
The spirit of sweet charity
And gentle human sympathy
Needs poverty and misery,
Or it becomes frost-bitten 1
He was amazed to see us lean
On Government 1 It seemed so mean !
In Britain this was never seen,
Despite the stories written !
In Britain no one ever leant
Upon a foolish Government!
There is no public money spent
On charity in Britain !
We need to have more poverty,
More abject, sordid misery,
Which may arouse our sympathy
With those who have been smitten.
Like Britain, home of starving hordes,
Of almshouses and casual wards,
Outdoor-relief and pauper boards—
Like Cobden-smitten Britain !

THE PASSING OF JANE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It seemed that Australian girls did not display any
disoosition to become domestic servants. —Justice Mad-
den’s wife, reported in the Argus (20/8/’O7).
Where is that good Australian girl, the prize and pearl
of all,
Who loves to wear old boots, and whirl hot soapsuds
down the hall—
The one with red, tempestuous hands, with hard and
knobby knees,
Who sings a song, what time she stands among her
miseries
Of cluttered plates and gravy-boats, of gaunt and greasy
chops, ■ .
Of miscellaneous scraps and big tin basins filled with slops !
Where has that golden work-girl gone, the one that
“ knew her place ” ?
What joy to gaze once more upon her honest, shiny face .
We want that old girl back again, as willing as a horse,
Who loved her stuffy sleeping-den, her dog’s meals, cold
and coarse;
It’s she would pluck the frequent duck and grill the
grisly steak ;
She did not buck at her bad luck in back-and-shoulder
It’s she would black the cooking-place, and white the
laundry wall,
And, with a reach almighty, chase the cockroaches a-crawl
Across the creviced kitchen-floor. When shall her memory
fade,
Though (being dead) she’ll work no more—that big, cheap
kitchen-maid !

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
WHO IS SHE ?
Chicago tribune (u.s.a> has by » pro-
cess of exhaustive inquiry decided that Miss
Marguerite Frey is the most beautiful woman in
America. Going boldly further, that paper claims
she is the most beautiful woman in the world !
The Lone Hand has been challenged to contest
an Australian against her, and takes up the
challenge cheerfully. If Australians will co-
operate, The Lone Hand is confident that it can
produce a more beautiful woman than Miss
Marguerite Frey.
The contest will be conducted with impartiality
and without vulgarity. Every good-looking
woman in Australia, whatever her position in
life, should be a contestant. It is for the reputa-
tion of Australia!
Readers are invited to at once submit photo-

The bankruptcy examination of one P. J.
Moy in Sydney, last week, shows that Private
Enterprise can be easily a bigger ass than even
the incap ible Government officer whose acts
occasionally heap derision on State management.
Moy was an “agent.” Agents in Sydney are
appallingly frequent. Lately his business led him
to try jute, and his dealings became so extensive
that he found his staff of one boy quite
inadequate. He therefore sacked the boy, and
engaged a couple of clerks at £1 a week
to keep up with the procession. In the
last few months of his career he had been
buying and selling so many bags that
even two clerks lost count of them. The
brokers (in Sydney if a useless parasite isn’t
an agent he is a broker) used to urge him
to buy and sell bags all day long, and on
each occasion the brokers would collect com-
mission on the deal, and very soon the biggest
broker was Moy himself. Nobody can quite make
out what has happened. Moy has been buying
bags and Moy has been selling bags, and appa-
rently he owes £BO,OOO. Moy is of the opinion th at
he seldom saw any bags ; at any rate, he didn’t
see the millions of bags that a loss of £BO,OOO
ought to represent. Sometimes in the baggy whirl
Moy would buy a herd of goods from somebody,
and before he even smelt them he would re-sell
them to the party who sold them to him and lose
perhaps £250 on the deal, paying commission
to the broker each time. Naturally Moy went
bung. The £BO,OOO he has lost, of course, never
existed. The universe is just as rich as before
Moy started to sell bags. These bags came from
Calcutta, and all the time half a score of agents and
brokers had played with them they weren’t
getting any bigger or worth any more. The
farmer occasionally hears that the socialist pro-
poses to control the means of distribution, and he
is told that perdition stares him in the face unless
he votes Anti-Sosh. Next time this happens he
should remember Moy’s bags, and the lost
£BO,OOO, and the broker with his commission.
For somebody must pay for all these luxuries,
and unless all this private enterprise is ultimately
added to the price of bags, it is hard to see what
account it is charged to.

“Adelaide”: If this mild City of
Churches is really too exciting for “Peter Pan,”
he had better leave it for Oodnadatta—the mixed
train runs occasionally. The only other alternative
is to leave off the coarse Ned Kelly literature he
evidently lives on. His alarmist par. (B. 5/9/’O7)
gathers up all the casual disappearances of half-
a-eentury, adds as a desperate mystery the case
of an office boy who has taken a holiday without
leave, and throws in a fairy tale that nobody I
have asked ever heard of. (Fairy tale it must be,
for the victim broke his neck falling into a well,
and was discovered by a dog scratching him up
in the surface sand !) “ Peter ” must certainly
change _ his brand of literature—or of whisky.
Otherwise he will become like journalist G. ft.
Sims, who has brooded over the romance and
mystery of London so long and bitterly that now
to him every man running for a train is a
criminal fleeing from justice, and a clerk taking
home some fish in a bag is a ruffian on his way to
dump portions of his murdered uncle in'the
lhames, and every bit of torn paper that flies
down the street is the Lost Will or the Incrimi-
nating Document.

The coal-saving plan lately invented by
one .of Tait’s Vic. railway geniuses, whereby
every engine-driver measured the capacity of his
shovel and then kept tally of the number of
shovelfuls used per trip, has been abandoned.
One of the frequent inspectors now hops on an
engine casually, counts the ounces of coal used
during a ten-minutes spell or thereabouts, and
then steps off to test the next driver. Of course
this proceeding helps the driver to keep his nerves
steady, his head clear and his eye fixed on the
sticks and the track. Also, it makes his life a
joy and a perennial riot of happiness.

“ P.”: Isn’t the accommodation of servant
girls as fit a subject for legislation as the accom-
modation of girls in factories ? One Daisy Grim-
shaw (apparently a domestic servant) writes to
Melb. Argus to ask for inspectors, and to state
that, with good wages and a comfortable home,
the supply of servants would exceed the demand.
In a large proportion of houses, the servant’s
bedroom is alongside the dog’s. The two animals
are so close that you can hardly tell which it is
that is barking in the night.
THE INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC.
Two throats with but a single cough,
Two colds that sneeze as one !
One of the passing excitements of the week
was the disappearance of the Union s.s. Monowai,
which was four days late on the run across from
Maoriland. It was picked up by the Mokoia,
after wallowing helplessly in a heavy sea till
everybody on board was dead tired and most
were considerably bumped. A wrecked
rudder was the trouble. Six years ago the
Monowai did the same sort of trick, and then also
the Mokoia picked it up. It seems to be a habit
these two boats have.
“ Wakeful ” writes :
I’m surprised that The Bulletin should print “ Dor-
mant’s” doleful dream of Ballarat (22/8/’O7). “ Dormant’s ”
title is the only fact in his misleading wail. Here are
some cheerful facts that he wasn’t alive enough to gather.
The Golden City grows steadily larger. Its population
mounts from 45,000 to 50,000. The municipal rating
values increase every year. No city outside the State
capitals can boast of finer buildings—completed and in
course of construction. The gardens which beautify
Sturt-street for a mile and a quarter are an artistic lesson
to all Australia. The removal of the Sunshine Harvester
works was only one egg lost from a big basket. It’s the duck
egg that “Dormant” has scored. Other foundries employ-
ing more skilled labor abound, and are turning out every
description of machinery. An instance. Donaldson and
Tippett are forwarding an exhibit to the Melbourne Royal
Show, which is valued at over £lOOO. It comprises oil
engines, chaff cutters, etc., which are recognised as the
best in Australia. The Ballarat Woollen Mills kept going
all through the low tariff times, and use no shoddy yarns
like “ Dormant’s.” Their yearly trade is £60,000, and, if
the Lyne tariff goes through, more machinery will be
obtained, and even better results attained. Doveton
Woollen Mills are plugging along. Long’s Biscuit
Factory and Edwards’ Pyrites Works are surely big
enough to be noticed. The mines are all going
steadily, even if they’re not booming. The
Besses band merely postponed its visit on account
of Melbourne successes, and will play in Ballarat in
September. As “Mother Goose” panto, recently took
£950 at three performances, it certainly looks promising
for the English band. The Y.M.C.A. has just collected
£5OOO in 30 days, and no “ crook ” half-crowns were found
in the hat. The empty houses “Dormant” writes of
must be the pubs on Sundays since the operation of the
new Licensing Act. As “ Dormant ” should be awake by
now, I offer him these facts for his breakfast, and will
furnish others if wanted.

Tasmania, with the heavy weight of the
big, lazy landlord on its brain, and the drone of
the Hobart Muckery and the House of Doderyin
itsears, goes to sleep very e.irly. Some of it, in fact,
never apparently wakes after it is born. W. L.
Neale, the brisk Director of Education broughtover
a few years ago from S. Australia (where he was
one of “Hartley’s young men,” and Hartley was
a great trainer), has just bean counting up the
number of Tasmanian youngsters who don’t go to
any school. In N. S. Walts there are 19 per 1000
between 6 and 14 who are not on any school roll;
in Victoria, 58 ; in Tasmania, no less than 356.
In his annual report Neale discusses the why and
wherefore; and apparently there are three'chief
whys and the same number of wherefores : (l) the
city schools are inadequate; (2) the parents are
asleep, and the authority that ought to wake them
up is also asleep; (3) the teachers in some cases
are “dull and stodgy,” which is apparently
another way of saying that they are not really
awake either.

miles from, say, Wysea (N.S.W.), a guard of a

far as Jacobsville. Peter’s heart was soft and he
consented, and on the way shared his dinner with
the “ broken-down one,” and at parting gave him
a shilling. A fortnight later Peter was sum-
moned to appear before the great Traffic Pasha and
was introduced to a well-dressed and well-groomed
one-armed man. “ Sit down, Peter, and make a
report and show cause why you should not be
dismissed the service.” Must N.S.W. railway
department do that sort of thing to keep a check
on its employees ?

“J.A.C.”: It is surprising how little we
know of what is going on amongst us. From an
Italian illustrated paper of recent date I have
unearthed the following :
A young Australian writer, convinced, not without
reason, the sale of a book depends more on the
notoriety of its author than on its intrinsic merit, con-
ceived a bright idea. On the same day that his latest
novel issued from the press in Sydney he killed a China-
man, who was peaceably pursuing his occupation of
wharf laborer. The effect was enormous ; the advertise-
ment caused the book to sell like wild-fire. But he will
not enjoy the profits, for the Sydney Court of Assizes has
condemned him to death. The egregious imbecile has
perpetrated a romance and a homicide for his heirs.
I wonder when the execution takes place. I
have never seen a hanging, and I want to go !
The Melbourne police, now largely com-
posed of ex-farm burners, do their utmost to out-
vie the Melbourne hospital doctors in crass
ignorance. The Melbourne hospital doctors
hold the record for diagnosing the apoplectic
and the skull-fractured as plain drunks, and
sending them to die in gaol. But the police go
one better by regarding a broken leg as a sign of
violent intoxication, combined with a tendency to
commit assault and tear the bobby’s uniform ;
while a dead man is always liable to be booted
because he won’t answer “a civil ques-
tion.” In North Melbourne one recent night, a
man was knocked down in the street by a passing
vehicle. Some bystanders picked him up, dosed
him with whisky to revive him, and sent for the
police and the ambulance. The police, in the
shape of a large, heavy cop, arrived first,
and asked the injured man his name and
address. All the man could reply was “ I
beg y’r pardon.” The bobby grew suspicious
and smelt the whisky, and straightway diag-
nosed the case as drunk. The ambulance
cart arrived, and the driver agreed with the con-
stable. Both of them flatly refused to listen to
the account of the accident and to the explana-
tion that the whisky was administered as a
restorative; they brushed the Samaritans aside,
and dragged the poor wretch off to the lockup.
Seeing that his skull was fractured, and his
body bruised all over, it was a wonder he lived till
morning; but he managed to do so. Then, as he
was even more “ drunk ” than the night before, he
was taken to the hospital, where he died. Next
came the inquest, and after hearing the gruesome
story, Coroner Candler made the following absurd
remark: —
It is a common thing- for even medical men to mistake
concussion of the brain for cases of drunkenness. Ido
not think the police can be blamed.
That was where Mr. Candler was wrong. What
he should have said was that it is common for
cheap hospital sucklings to make such mistakes, and
that the kind of bobby Melbourne possesses these
times is capable of anything.

Maoriland’s Chow slayer, Lionel Terry,
when asked to explain his conduct, said that
someone would have to be hanged for Chow
murder before tired Maoriland would assume the
perpendicular and boot the Yellow Smell into the
cold void. An amazed country refused to hang
Terry, and the Smell blossoms as of yore, only
more so. Recently several persons have been try-
ing to rouse the country to a sense of decency, but
without much success. W. A. Lloyd resigned a
job in the Tourist Department, and, armed with
the written blessing of Premier Ward, proceeded
to form an Anti-Chow league. Wellington gave
him half-hearted support, and a branch was
formed. Dunedin, which is Scotch and Chpw-
ridden—most of the Celestials call themselves
McDougall and Maconochie and Muck Hi—was
opposed to any interference, and the ex-civil ser-
vant was obliged to desist. In the meantime the
Wellington branch had dissolved through lack of
backbone, and Chow was triumphant. As a last
resource, Terry is asking the Government to hang
him ; but though the idea is novel, it is doubtful
whether this course would be effective. TheMaori-
lander mostly loves his yellow “brudder,” with his
leprosy and his hundred smells, and thinks that
cheap and rotten vegetables are preferable to a
dead Terry.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Twelve months ago it was complained that nc
Balance-sheet ot the Westralian Goldfields Water Supply
enterprise was ever published. An attempt was, how-
ever, made then to figure out the position, and the total
deficit for three years was found to be £260,553. For the
year to the end of June, 1907, the secretary of the ad-
ministration puts the position a little more clearly in his
annual report, though still no balance-sheet and nothing
positive in the way of a profit and loss account are pre-
sented. This is characteristic of the sloppy, drifting
ways of Westralian public finance. Taking the best
figures available, partly from the Auditor-General’s re-
ports and partly from the reports of the Goldfields Water
Supply Administration, the situation is something like
this:—
(Interest
and
Working Writ- Sinking
Ex- ten Fund
June, Revenue, penses. Off. Required. Deficit.
1904 ? ? ? £101,911
1905 .. £141,067 £42,835 £179,032 80,800
1906 .. 159,425 44,550 £ll,OOO 181,717 77,842
1907 .. 167,146 53,928 11,000 186,789 84,571
Total deficit for four years £345,124
The only figures available for the first year (1904) are con-
tained in the summary of the Auditor-General, which sets
out that £54,000 was paid to the Treasury, “showing a
loss of £101,911 to the State for the year.”
Two lots of money have been raised by two different
authorities in connection with the Goldfields Water
Supply. First, the State raised £2,875,000, though it
raised it at such heavy cost in the shape of discount that
the amount spent on the work appears to have been only
£2,636,600. Subsequently, the Administration, or Trust,
raised £267,000. The interest on the big amount averages
something under 3J per cent. ; the sinking fund provided
for is 3 per cent. The Trust pays 3| per cent, interest
and provides for 2 per cent, sinking fund—or is supposed
to. For the four years the interest and sinking fund on
both accounts have been as follows
Sinking
June, Interest. Fund. Total.
1904 .. £83,952 .. £71,959 .. £155,911
1905 .. 94,792 .. 84,240 .. 179,032
1906 .. 96,565 .. 86,152 .. 181,717
1907 .. 100,272 .. 86,517 .. 186,789
Total £375,581 £327,868 £703,449
These figures are not necessarily exact; they have had to
be computed in most cases, and in other cases the Wes-
tralian reports from which they are taken are sloppy and
inexact. But they can only be a few pounds out either
way. In the first table above it was shown that the aggre-
gate deficit for the four years was £345,124. And as the
sinking fund contributions total £327,868 (or should have
totalled that much), it follows that up to date the scheme
has absolutely paid not one farthing of sinking fund. So
far from paying any sinking fund, it has actually fallen
short of paying interest by £17,256.
Every time Westralian finance is dug into it
yields some new disgrace. And this is another yield of
that sort. When the Forrest Government was prevailed
upon to carry out this scheme, it was agreed that the
enormously rich goldfields should pay for it. They didn’t
for a moment suggest that that wasn’t a fair thing—they
professed to' regard it as too reasonable to be worth
arguing about. Therefore Bigjohn, when he borrowed
the money, realising that the rich gold couldn’t last
many years, provided for a 3 per cent, sinking fund. No
sooner, however, had the work beer, completed, and the
cos. had the water, than they combined, and held a gun up
to the head of the Government; and they got the price
reduced. Since then they have distributed among them-
selves, mostly in London, over £2,000,000 a year in divi-
dends ; and, instead of paying sinking fund, they haven’t
even paid all the interest on the debt.
Who has paid it, then ? Nobody ! In the same
four years the total State deficit has been £440,387.
That means that nobody has paid the £327,868 of sinking
fund and the £17,256 of interest on the Goldfields Scheme
—the State has just let it slide, along with another
£95,263. But there is Cohen in London who demands
the interest, and there are Sinking Fund Commissioners
also in London who represent Cohen, and they have
demanded the sinking fund ; so the money has had to be
raised, and it has been raised by borrowing it and throw-
ing the I O U into the cradle for the baby to struggle with
by and bye. Westralians say they can’t make out where
their persistent deficits come from. These figures, how-
ever, make it quite clear: they mostly come from the
subsidy, amounting to £345,124 in four years, which
Westralia is making the future pay to the greedy foreign
crowd that is ripping the gold out as fast as it can, and
distributing it in dividends at the rate of over £2,000,000
a year. If Westralia chose to subsidise the foreign cos.,
and paid the subsidy out of its own pocket, there would
be less to complain about. All that could be said in
that case would be that it was something extra in the
way of a fool. But when it pays the subsidy by borrow-
ing it and handing the billon to its children, then it is
something worse than a fool, and to call it a rogue would
be mild. And now a crowd of dullards in Westralia say
that the new tariff is going to make these companies pay
back some £50,000 a year of this outrageous subsidy, and
talk of that as a grievance and a horrid dreadful wrong.

From Geo. Crowley, of the City Mutual : “Par
in ‘Wild Cat Column’ (B. 12/9/’O7) re M.L.A.-Citizens’
amalgamation is lacking in your usual lucidity. I hold
no brief for the A.M.P., but it is crude to compare the
A.M.P.’s 13 per cent, with the proposed 10 per cent, for
liquidating the M.L.A. Fully half the A.M.P.’s 13 per
cent, is due to the new business expenses. This item will
be absent altogether from the M.L.A.’s accounts after the
end of the year. If the Equitable Co. can be liquidated
at 3 per cent, (and your next par in the same
issue would appear to show this), then 10 per cent, for
liquidating the M.L.A. is pretty good evidence that the
Citizens’ is on a good wicket. There is not a mutual life office
in Australia which would not have been delighted to take
over the M.L.A. and charge 10 per cent, ‘from the jump.’”
This lacks Mr. Crowley’s usual keenness (surely one good
scratch deserves another); in fact, it entirely loses the
point. If every mutual office in Australia would have
been prepared to take over the M.L.A. and charge 10 per
cent, only, why don’t they all do for their own present
policy-holders what they are alleged to be prepared to do
for outsiders, and charge their present policy-holders
only 10 per cent? The M.L.A.’s business isn’t to be
merely liquidated. The M.L.A. policy-holder is to get
an interest in the new business ; and while the A.M.P.
policy-holder pays 13 per cent, for the cost of managing
his own policy and for his interest in future business, the
M.L.A. policy-holder is to get the same for a guaranteed
10 per cent. The difference between the case of the
Equitable and that of the M.L.A.-Citizens’ amalgamation
is just this: For 3 per cent, the people who are to
liquidate the Equitable business in Australia don’t under-
take to lift a finger to get new business. For 10 per cent,
the people who are to manage the M.L.A.’s business will,
for their own sake, get all the new business they can lay
hold of.
If the Australians who bought shares in the
Canadian Marconi Co. can’t get their scrip, they can at
least get some news about how the affair is going. And
the latest news isn’t cheerful. They were told that the
co. had a monopoly of the wireless telegraphy business in
Canada—that the Government practically stood behind
the co. Now, according to an Ottawa telegram to the
New York Sun, “ the Dominion Minister of Justice has
advised the Department of Marine that there is nothing
in the terms of the agreement preventing the Crown from
erecting a wireless station and equipping it with instru-
ments other than the Marconi instruments. Acting on
this advice, the Dominion Government is establishing and
operating wireless stations on the Pacific Coast indepen-
dent of the Marconi Company. The Government will fight
this claim of the Marconi Company for an absolute
monopoly of the wireless telegraph business of the
Government.”
* ■* * *
By the last mail the Union Bank in Sydney got
certificates for another two or three hundred Canadian
Marconi shares from Munroe and Munroe, of New York,
making a total of 923 received to date. There were
between 8000 and 9000 shares applied and paid for in
Sydney, besides, it was said, about 6000 in Melbourne. As
far as can be learned, none of the latter and only about
10 per cent, of the former have been received. A curious
thing about those that have come is that they have been
in three batches, and their arrival has been spread over
nearly nine months. If Munroe and Munroe, in spite of
one previous disaster (which, however, they subse-
quently wiped out very creditably), were not a firm of so
good a reputation, the explanation would lie on the
surface: in that case it would be at once assumed that
they never had the shares, but were spec.-selling, relying
on a slump in the market to later on buy in and supply
at a profit as the shares could be picked up. If there has
been spec.-selling on the part of Munroe and Munroe or
others, the reports regarding a flaw in the alleged
arrangements between the co. and the Canadian Govern-
ment "may possibly be explained. Those reports may be
part of a “bear ’’raid, designed to knock the market
out. Or, on the other hand, the spec.-sellers may have
known that there was a real flaw, and proceeded to sell
on the strength of it.

Although it is being crushed by Federation, and robbed
by the Commonwealth Government, Tasmania is having a
remarkably good time. There is, in consequence, an
expansion of business, and a demand for advances such
as Tasmania has not had for many years. Whether the
business is very sound is another matter ; and, unfortu-
nately, the balance-sheets of banks don’t tell you what
sort of margin they are requiring—whether they are
advancing 90 per cent, of boom values and risking a
slump, or whether they are keeping on the safe side and
advancing only 50 per cent, or so. Also it isn’t possible
to say how much of the profit now disclosed represents
recoveries of old debts that had been written off. If
there has been anything much in the way of recoveries,
profits have been, so to speak, double-banked ; and a
return to normal conditions would result in a much more
severe drop in the profit figures than the change in the
conditions would otherwise bring about. To counter-
balance anything of that sort, the bank is doing some
heavy writing-down ; £4OOO comes off the holding of Con-
sols (reducing them to £B2 10s.), and another £2OOO comes
off premises. (Consols are now worth £B2 ss. ; twelve
months ago they stood at £B6 7s. 6d.)

mania’s recent business: —

The liquid assets show the holding of Consols before the
writing-down. For some reason the bank charges this
amount direct to profit and loss, probably regarding it as
a set-off against recoveries of old debts. Not reckoning
that as an expense, however, the profit for the half-year
compares with recent records like this :
Feb., 1904 .. £8 18 11 p.c. Feb., 1906 .. £7 17 10 p.c.

Especially considering that the public moneys (deposits,
etc.) are only five times greater than the shareholders’
money in the business, profits are excellent; yet the limit
of safe trading seems about reached on present resources.
On account of the reduction of deposits and increase of
advances, the liquid assets are now only 30 per cent, of
the liabilities ; and it is not usually regarded as safe to
go much lower than that. The comparatively large in-
terest of the shareholders in the business adds to the
security of the depositor ; after applying liquid assets to
paying depositors, there are enough non-liquid assets to
represent £1 Bs. lOd. in the £ of the balance of the liabili-
ties—a very substantial margin, especially when the pro-
fitableness of the assets is considered.

Down to the last year the loss on sales has been so small,
not because properties were worth what the books
alleged, but simply because so very few of them were
sold. In 1896 properties and advances (mostly foreclosed
properties)represented in all £78,169; ten years later (1906)
they had only been reduced to £70,796. In the past
year, however) an effort has been made to clear things
up a little. The directors report that properties have
realised £8999 ; and the balance-sheet shows that the
contingency fund has been drawn on to the extent of
£3475 to provide for “ losses on properties realised.” The
total of advances and properties now stands at £62,962 ;
you can’t balance that with the figures just mentioned
because some of the sales have been on terms, like those
made in previous years. The one satisfactory feature in
the case is that there are practically no creditors ; 12
months ago, loans and deposits totalled £4236, but all
that remain now are deposits £2OB and sundry accounts
for £73. To what extent the recent sales are a guide to
the real value of the properties in band it is impossible to
say ; they are probably too small to form a basis of calcu-
lation. If they could be relied upon, then the properties,
etc., would be worth 72 per cent, of their book value, or
say £45,000, plus £l5OO representing cash in hand and
sundries. (The present capital is £57,480.) But, judging
by the interest return, the assets are not worth anything
like that. As we can see from the table above, they have
not been able to earn for the shareholders 1J per cent.,
after paying interest on the small amount of deposits.
For the past year interest and rent totalled £lBB3 gross ;
on a 5 per cent, basis that means only £37,660. The re-
venue, less rent and repairs, was £1386 ; and on the same
5 per cent, basis, that would mean a total value of
£27,720. The latter, which is probably not far away from
the mark, would mean writing off all the reserves and
half the capital, and even then it isn’t easy to see how
anything more than 3 per cent, could be paid at the out-
side, for the concern is now really too small to be worked
economically—a fact that the present inflated figures are
apt to obfuscate.

1907 .. 3027 2654 338 35 4493
These accounts are badly presented. (1) The distribu-
tion to shareholders consists of a dividend proper (6 per
cent.), a bonus (1J per cent.), and a 4 per cent, bonus on
goods purchased. The total payments are lumped ; and
it is impossible to separate bonus and dividend, because
the amount of capital is constantly varying, and the
dividend is apparently not computed on the full amount
paid as at the end of the year. (2) The annual bonus
to staff is included in the appropriations, and
the directors lump it with the shareholders’
dividend, etc. They sav —“These distributions will
absorb approximately £2774.” In the foregoing, this
bonus is, of course, reckoned as an expense, and has
been deducted from profits. It has been assumed that
for 1906-7 it will amount to £l2O. (3) The bad debts
reserve has been added to the ordinary reserve without
remark. The directors announce for the past year
“ Revenue account discloses a net profit of £3900, being
an increase of over £400.” This is a cheap-jack way of
putting things, and is not worthy of a directors’ report ;
for out of that alleged net profit there has to be provided
£169 for income tax, £635 for bad debts, also depreciation
and the employees’ bonus. The distributions have been
increasing much too rapidly ; and, especially considering
the heavy debt (£47,406, while the capital is only £20,902),
the additions to reserve have become much too small. Of
these liabilities and the capital, £53,879 is represented on
the other side by “advances against grain, wool, stock,
etc., and amounts at debit of clients’ accounts” —busi-
ness that necessarily carries considerable risk. Under
the circumstances, as the reserves are still small, and as
the distributions permit of only a paltry £35 being added
to the reserves, the dividend or bonus ought to have been
reduced.

The profit on the year’s ordinary transactions was £536,
after providing £252 net for depreciation. But some time
ago this co. beg'an financing the Duckenfield Co-opera-
tive Dairy Co., and that concern was something extra in
the way of disaster, considering its size. As shown on
October 4 iast year, it had managed to lose £3695 J
on a capital of £1496 in the previous three years,
mainly, it was contended, because the factory was in the
wrong place. Anyway, this Duckenfield Co. with the
capital of £1496 got into the Farmers and Settlers’ debt
to the extent of £4415, and now that has to be provided
for. Possibly it isn’t utterly lost. This co. has, as pre-
viously reported, put the Duckenfield Co. into a new
factory at Morpeth, and now Morpeth is expected to wire
in and wipe off the debt incurred at Duckenfield. Pro-
bably Morpeth won’t see things in that light ; wherefore
“although it is anticipated that this co. will not be
involved in any loss, your directors have deemed it pru-
dent to place to reserve a sum of £4414 to meet a possible
contingency.” Auditor Borchard has, however, signed a
balance-sheet which puts it boldly—“ Net loss to date,
£18,785,” and Borchard is a good man to agree with in
such things. The liabilities of the co. have been growing
like this :

1906 .. 17,662 11,942 29,604
1907 .. 34,367 23,621 57,988
The capital, less deficit, is £29,590 ; so the liabilities are
very nearly double the capital intact, and there is a contin-
' gent liability of £75,339 on account of drafts negotiated
and P.N.’s discounted, chiefly in connection with wheat
shipments. It was in connection wfith w'heat transactions,
by the way, that the very heavy loss shown in 1904 was in-
curred. Of the capital of £48,375 (£18,785 of which has been
lost), £2Q,078 is preference—cumulative preference, it is
understood ; and as no dividend has been paid for years,
the real interest of the ordinary shares in the business is
becoming very faint. The existence of cumulative pre-
ference capital necessarily destroys most of the co-opera-
tive character of the business ; in fact, in the ordinary
Australian sense of the term it ceased to be co-operative
a good while ago—the fact that Mr. ffm. McMillan is
chairman and that Mr. YVm. McMillan’s firm has the
largest interest in the business is pretty good evidence of
that.

The profits are made up in this way : Wright, Heaton
and Co., Queensland, £1263 ; ditto, N. S. Wales, £4784 ;
interest in McCulloch Carrying Co., £l9OB. The Queens-
land business shows considerable improvement; the co.
has jumped at the brighter state of things up north to
sell out of various unproductive branches. Apparently
the McCulloch dividends have not yet been received ;
the practice is for W., H. & Co. to take credit for profits
made as at the end of the half-year, without waiting for
the actual distribution. This co.’sinterest in McCulloch’s,
including profits undivided, is £18,387. (Some time ago
it was shown that the interest in the McCulloch Co.’s
capital amounted to £12,500.) Book-debts (apart from
the McCulloch item) have been growing rapidly, and
liabilities have grown with them. This show's the posi-
tion in that and some other respects

In considering the recent increase in profits the rapid
growth of liabilities, represented on the other side by
book debts, has to be taken into account. Profit and
loss account contains no charge for bad and doubtful
debts ; it may be there, nevertheless, hidden up under
other things. If a substantial provision is not made, the
movement of the figures must be viewed with a little un-
easiness ; at any rate, a proportion of the profits can in
that case only be regarded as profits tentatively—until
bad debts happen along to call for a writing-down of
reserves.

The accounts are well presented. Of the amount written
off during the past 12 months £225 has come off plant
and £275 off mains and services (apart from meters).
This is equal to 2£ per cent, of the book value of mains
and services, and slightly under 2 per cent, of plant, etc.
Kepairs and renewals —some of them, at any rate—are
charged direct to manufacturing account; this improves
the internal provision for renewals which this writing-
down really constitutes. The co. has no debts beyond
£159 consumers’ deposits, and sundries £123. On the
other side, apart from plant, mains, etc., the co. has
about £5600 of liquid assets after paying current divi-
dend ; so the reserve provision for extraordinary re-
newals isn’t all turned into gas pipes and buildings, as it
is in a great many cases.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Broken Hill
Prop, a Scotch shareholder asked, re zinc—“ What profit
per ton of tailings is likely to be realised at present prices
of metals when the plant is working at its fullest capa-
city?” To which the chairman replied—“ The profit,
taking spelter at £23, with a grade of concentrates of 42
percent, zinc., l7oz. silver, 10i per cent. lead, is approxi-
mately 225. per ton.” That looks a clear enough state-
ment, and last week The Bulletin assumed that that was
the profit per ton of tailings—the Scotch shareholder had
asked what “the profit'per ton of tailings” was likely to
be. Secretary Dickenson, of the B. H. Prop., now, how-
ever, writes that “ the remarks have been in some way
misunderstood, as the profit referred to of 225. per
ton was per ton of concentrates, and not per ton
of tailings.” Phew! That makes things look very
sick for zinc, or, anyhow, for the B. H. Prop.’s process.
Last half-year 116,240 tons of tailings were treated for
25,353 tons concentrates ; and 225. per ton of concen-
trates works out at 4s. 9d. per ton of tailings. That is
with zinc (spelter) at £23 per ton. The present quotation
for spelter is about £2O 12s. 6d. per ton. Zinc concen-
trates go about 42 per cent, (rather less than that, but
that was the basis of calculation submitted by the Scotch
shareholder). The gross zinc contents of 42 per cent,
concentrates at £23 per ton of zinc would be worth £9
13s. 2d. ; ditto at £20125. 6d., £8 13s. 3d., or 19s. lid. less
per ton of concentrates. Of course it doesn’t follow that
the zinc concentrates are worth 19s. lid. per ton less
than they were when the zinc quotation was £23. For
one thing, the zinc smelters don’t pay for all the zinc ;
and if they only paid for half, it would follow that the
decline in value would be only half of 19s. lid. Still the
results are very disappointing, and the margin of profit is
now perilously small : 4s. 9d. per ton of “ tailings ” looks
as unaccountably low as 225. looked high.
A Scotchman asked the Broken Hill
Prop, for a little more information about the- profit de-
rived from the treatment of zinc tailings. He elicited
that profit depends on the quantity of tailings it takes to
produce a ton of concentrates, the grade of the latter,
and the value- of zinc, lead and silver, based on average
prices a year after delivery at Broken Hill. The B. H.
Prop, has a big contract to supply European smelters,
running to 1910 ; so the Scotchman will have to wait till
the end of 1910 to find how the B. H. Prop, finally comes
out of the contract. With spelter at £23, and lead and
silver ,at late rates, the profit on concentrates worth 42
per cent, zinc, 10J per cent, lead, 17oz. silver is 22/- ;
with spelter at present price it would be less. The
Scotchman wasn’t told the price for spelter at which all
profits would disappear. Taking the statements pub-
lished in London, without analysing them, London forced
up Prop, shares on the strength of this possibly imaginary
profit of £1 2s. per ton. The B. H. South shareholders
no doubt thought they were badly done by to only get
3s. lOd. a ton for tailings ; but it is quite possible if they
get paid at that rate for the dump they will have cause
to congratulate themselves.

The attempt to boom New White Leads,
Broken Hill, by talking about a 500-ton mill, needs a little
more oiling,,so. the shaft is being sunk from 400 ft. to
500 ft. Even when that work is completed, and the level
has been opened out, the chances of the Leads being able
to produce 500 tons of fair milling ore per week are re-
mote. The ore body at the 400 ft. level is a very poor
thing in spite of inflated reports to the contrary, and it is
not likely to expand into anything great or good within
the next hundred feet. There is a pretty good patch of
sulphides between the 200 ft. and 400 ft. levels, where a
winze was started years ago, but the ore is as
hard as the hobs on which Satan does his grilling,
and there is not much of it at that. The comic
relief to the White Leads melodrama is supplied
by two or three prospectors, who shepherd small
scratches on the eastern rim of the White Leads flat, , and
wait for the millennium to arrive. They expect that the
millennium will wear a tall silk hat and will offer them
some millions to sell out.

The promised treatment of 2000 tons per week
at the Broken Hill Junction North mill hasn’t yet
materialised, but that happy state of affairs may be
looked for some time in November. It has cost, and still
is costing, a terrible lot of money to keep the mill in
repairs. These troubles once overcome, there is a good
mine waiting to feed both sections of the plant.

As far as the production of a first concentrate is
concerned, the Central’s (Sulphide Corporation) granula-
tion plant for treating the purchased Block 10 slimes is
now making everybody pleased. The pug mill which had
been provided to reduce to pulp the hard wedges of slime
that form between the layers on the dump failed to do
the work required of it. Instead, it formed the material
into little hard balls, which could not be concentrated,
and caused trouble by plugging up the gear. Cornish
rolls are now being installed to smash up the caked
slimes. Means are also being adopted by which it is
hoped to get the surplus moisture out of the fine powdery
portion of the slimes. Whep the slime plant is on good
behavior, it can put through in three shifts 111 tons for
57 tons of concentrates.

Budgery (N.S.W.) makes its first threepenny
call. This isn’t cheerful, considering that they have been
sending away the cream of the mine. The ore sales
realised £2865 ; the expenditure ran to £3612. But on
the ore (422 tons) for which the manager had returns he
estimated that there had been a profit of £4 4s. Bd. per
ton. It isn’t, however, much use considering what the
profit per ton was on the small amount of cream.
Money had to be spent on development work, and in
raising ore which has not been sent to the smelters
because it isn’t cream ; there are about 1000 tons of this
in the dumps. So the so-called profit has gone,
and something else as well. The shipment of ore is to
be stopped now : as a matter of fact, there is very little ore
available which would show a margin. The developments
are not far enough advanced either to justify the co. in
providing a plant for treatment on the mine. Above the
266 ft. level the directors say there “ may be any quantity
over 20,000 tons, of an average value of 4'5 per cent,
copper ” ; but at 266 ft. the manager says the stuff is “ not
rich enough to send away for treatment,” which means
mostly that it can’t be picked like the ore from nearer the
top of the enriched body. Considering the giddy heights
to which the copper market climbed during the half-year,
and the enriched stuff the co. had to start on, Budgery
made a poor beginning, and there seems to be no likeli-
hood of anything but very moderate success in the future.


Since the slump in the copper market became
acute, there is more disposition to look up the past
history of metals. It is always the same during a boom ;
people tell you that conditions are so altered that what
would have been boom prices yesterday are quite normal
prices to-day. In short, for the sharps to make money
out of a boom, it is necessary for them to get the flats to
believe that there isn’t any boom ; and they managed
that very well during 1906 and the early part of 1907.
Now, however, in connection with zinc, it will be easier
to get people to consider the average prices for the past
10, or 20, or 30 years—it doesn’t matter much which.
Since 1901 there had undoubtedly been a steady upward
movement until a few months ago. In 1901 the price
averaged £l7 os. 7d. ; this time 12 months ago it was
£27 Bs. 9d. But, prior to this advance, in only six years
out of the past 30 had the twelve-months’ average been
above £2O. In 1895 the average was as low as £l4 12s. 2d ;
but that was in a period of abnormally low prices all
round. Conditions now are not favorable to low prices
all round; so £l4 quotations can be put out of the
questidh. But, even making allowances for the higher
level Of price 3, the zinc producers will be very fortunate
if the price stays over £2O.

Opal mining at Lightning Ridge, out Walgett
way (N.S.W.), has had a glimpse of prosperity. Last
year the output of Ridge opal was worth about £BOOO ; so
it needed a few lucky finds to keep 200-and-odd gougers
clinging to the place. There is a Progress Association,
a school with 50 youngsters attending it, and two or
three stores, and a water tank is being scooped out.
Buyers now know the value of Lightning Ridge opal
better, and are paying higher prices ; in fact, the rise in
the price for the best opal has been extraordinary. Iri-
descent black opal, a particularly beautiful product of
the Ridge, is worth up to £5O an ounce ; a while back
it was hard to get a decent price for the best specimens.
The Ridge had to fight prejudice just as everything new
has to do. Opal produced in N.S.W. last year was worth
£56,500, so it is only a small industry, but the opal is
worth much more than the Australian gets for it—the
middleman buyer takes good care of that.

Recent reports from Mt. David (N.S.W.) read
well. The big bulge of stone has been proved about 70ft.
in length ; but the two rises show a contraction of the
reef to 2jft. That, of course, was expected, because the
level above—and it isn’t far above, either —was only
moderately payable. Winzes are to be sunk to see if the
shoot continues, which it seems certain to do for a few
feet; after that, no one can tell, in a place like Mt.
David, what will happen. The winch winze, 170 ft. or
more away, is down in very hard felsite. The inter-
mediate level, which was started a few weeks since above
the hard break in the country, has holed through to the
old working ; it was a short-winded level, but the stone
was good. Probably the change in the country rock has-
much to do with the enrichment; anyway the changes
from felsite to porphyry and slate are fairly rapid, and
the changes in the reef naturally follow suit.

Someone has gob the statement into print that
the Hainault shoots are about to pass into the adjoining
South Kalgurli. Nothing of the sort! The westerly, or
main, shoot is just about as likely to do this above a
vertical depth of 2000 ft. as Cardinal Moran is to become a
Wesleyan local preacher ; and the prospect of the easterly,
or next-best, make of ore passing over the boundary is
more remote still. A small body of lode stuff known as
the No. 2 shoot may enter the'South Kalgurli at about
1500 ft. from the surface ; but, even if it does, Hainault’s
loss will be a mere trifle.

Captain H. B. Hooper, chairman of the Asso-
ciated (W.A.), told shareholders, at the recent annual
meeting, that continued production at the present rate
should furnish at least £60,000 of distributable profit per
annum for the next five years. If earned, this surplus
will be sufficient to pay 2s. a year and provide for taxes,
the directors’ cut, etc. Hooper believes the mine has
great possibilities, with regard to which he referred
shareholders to the “ rich body of ore ” worked at the
No. 7 shaft in the north-east corner of the property, and
also to the discovery, at 2000 ft., in the neighboring
Great Boulder. If these are the pick of its possibilities,
however, the future of the property hangs on a very
slender thread. The shoot in the No. 7 workings is a
very short one, and only extends between the Nos. 1 and
2 levels, while the Associated and Boulder ore bodies are
almost as different as chalk and cheese. In the Asso-
ciated, the shoots are treacherous and unreliable ; in the
Boulder, the ore is fairly continuous and persistent with
depth.

North Kalgurli Co. (W.A.) is making another
effort to find payable ore. At one time it was thought
that the rich telluride shoots in the Kalgurli would con-
tinue into the North Kalgurli, but they cut out long
before the lodes reached the boundary. The North
Kalgurli has proved a rank duffer in depth, and its case
seems hopeless.
* * * *
Kalgurli (W.A.) seems to he picking up a bit in
the bottom, at 1350 ft. The last 100 ft. or so of driving
has revealed a big body of rich telluride ore, and it looks
as if this level would yield a lot of good stuff. London
attributes the recent heavy slump in the price of shares
to a seared Continental crowd forcing a big swag of scrip
on an unwilling market. When the selling ceased prices
recovered, and the market has been steadily rising ever
since.
* * * *
Mararoa, Norseman (W.A.), is now in bloom.
Assuming that official measurements and assays are cor-
rect, things are good in the bottom ; but speculators
can’t afford to forget that at Norseman all shoots hitherto
followed have died out at comparatively shallow depths.
The Mararoa may be the exception that proves the rule ;
but it isn’t safe to go nap On that. The recent disposal of
4100 reserve shares at 10s. apiece has put the co. on a
good financial footing, and dodged further calls. On
June 30 last ore reserves figured out at 25,000 tons, worth
48s. ; but since then the quantity has been substantially
added to.

The Bulletin has received word from the West
that “ about four tons of golden stone ” has been stolen
from the recently-floated Garden Gully, near Coolgardie.
As, however, the police failed to find any trace or indica-
tions of a robbery, it looks as if someone were trying to go
one better than the people who lately ascribed the slump
in Barrambie Ranges output to wholesale gold stealing.

“We are somewhat in debt to our bankers, but
we look to pay that off during the next few months.
Against this we have £6OOO worth of stores in hand, and
also some money in Westralia. Consequently the debt is
not quite as much as it appears, and I think that, by the
end of this year, we shall be making a profit of £4OOO a
month.”—R. Hoffmann, chairman of the Lancefield, at
the recent shareholders’ meeting.
* * * *
They jump to rash conclusions in the West.
The other day the Great Fingall Consolidated purchased
the adjacent Kinsella leases as an additional source of
water supply. It paid a modest little £2OO, and said
nothing. The Perth dailies, however, whooped exultantly
over the transaction, which they described as an im-
portant one, and one which would have the result of
adding another large employer of labor to the list of
Murchison gold-producers. An immediate increase in the
Fingall gold output was also predicted ; likewise a general
revival of mining throughout the field. But the Kinsella
did its dash as a gold-producing mine long ago, and is
only suitable for the purpose for which it has just been
acquired. In the past, co. after co. has “ gone broke ”in
trying to make it pay, and if the Fingall attempts to get
anything but water out of the “ mine,” it will add more
to its regrets than to its dividends.

The Havilah, like the others at Black Range
(W.A.), is a doubtful proposition. Nearly all the rich
ore seems to have been rooted out, and from all accounts
most of the leavings are erratic in value. The Maninga
Marley shoot, in the same locality, has gone wrong at a
little more than 200 ft. from the surface ; and the Havilah
is very liable to do the same. The Maninga Marley, by
the way, is the place that Sydney Telegraph never heard
of. The local township wired to Acting-Premier Lyne
that ;t, for one, cordially approved of the tariff ; where-
upon the Telegraph announced that Maninga Marley
was one of the millions of things it didn’t know, where-
fore the message was necessarily a hoax.

Meekatharra (W.A.) is battling hard for a
25-mile extension of the railway from Nannine. A depu-
tation waited upon State-Premier Moore, the other day,
and said that heavy cartage rates for timber, fuel, and
mining requisites were blocking the advancement of the
district, and it reeled off a mass of information, the cream
of which was that Meekatharra had produced about
35,0000 z. of gold to date, and that nearly half that quan-
tity had been won this year. Newton Moore promised to
look into the matter, and sent the deputation away with
the cheerful assurancethat he had never heard a better
case made out for any railway. It isn’t, however, what
has been taken out of the cupboard that counts. When
you’re hungry you want to know what is left in the cup-
board. And that is the aspect of the case that Newton
Moore overlooked.

Black, Blatchford, and Grut, the Westralian
firm of young Sydney engineers and metallurgists which
general-manages the Sandstone Development, have sent
across a report on the proceedings to July 20. Whitfield
and party, it will be remembered, put off the co., mainly
among Sydney Uni. men, on the strength chiefly of the
Oroya-Black Range reef dipping into their blocks. Now-
the general managers say, after quoting data, “ We feel
every confidence the main Sandstone [Oroya-Black
Range] line of reef will be cut in the No.X (Juno] shaft at
a vertical depth not exceeding 400 ft. We expect this
depth to be reached about the end of October next.” It
is some comfort to go on with, anyway.

From British Papua, August 21: “There are
about 50 men on Yodda goldfield. Some are doing fairly
well; others are not able to keep out of debt. One of
the old hands, Fred May, was the other day shot by his
own ‘ boy ’ with his own gun. He had sent the ‘boy’
out to shoot pigeons, and as he did not return
by dark, May fired off a couple of revolver shots
so as to guide the ‘boy.’ Then May started
writing up his diary preparatory to turning in. While he
was thus engaged the boy crept up, and sat down out of
range of light. Then, according to local accounts, he fired.
May fell over on to the table, and, when found dead a
few minutes after by one of his neighbors, he still had the
pen in his grasp. This man, though still young, was one
of the oldest hands and prospectors of the mainland, and
was thought a lot of by the miners on the fields. Judge
Murray is now at Pokoda, trying the case. The brightest
thing about this field is the discovery of a lode about six
weeks ago ; it is reputedly payable. This is important,
as it is the first thing of the kind yet discovered on the
mainland. What is considered payable here would be
deemed rich elsewhere.
“ There is news about the Waria goldfield,
much-talked-of eight or ten months ago. Two parties
have just returned to Samarai from there, having been
out for about twelve months. The amount of gold W'on is
not divulged, but is considered satisfactory ; anyway,
both parties are going back. This field is a poor one, but
is made to pay handsomely by men who are used to the
conditions of the country, and know how to manage the
natives. Both these parties employ a great many signed-
on natives, and, with their help, get through a large
quantity of ground. Native food is also fairly abundant
there. But it costs money to get a start. To fit out and
equip a party of two men and 20 * boys,’ and to land at the
first stage on the Waria track, would cost at least £3OO.
That includes 12 months’ supplies.
“ At Port Moresby things are booming in a small
way over the copper shows. The pioneer ore-shipper is said
to have cleared £2OOO during the last six months, doing
nothing but packing surface ore to the coast, and ship-
ping to Cairns. The last consignment gave an aver-
age of 49 per cent, copper. About eight months
ago a local syndicate of 25 men threw in £lO each,
making £250, and took up a mining lease of about
100 acres. They have had two white men (£5 per week
each) and 16 to 20 ‘boys’; and out of the proceeds,
besides taking up another lease and buying equipment,
they last month declared a div. of £2O per share. But
Papua has its own way of doing things. Instead of
pocketing the £2O the shareholders decided that it would
be much better to buy a strong team of pack-mules, so
that the syndicate could do its own packing; and that
was decided on. The reports about the show are very
bright; there is certainly very rich stuff there, and the
shareholders expect to make a little pile. Concerning
which, a line about Judge Murray. He had two shares ;
but when he was appointed Acting-Governor he immedi-
ately sold them, so as to be perfectly free. A fine repu-
tation, by the way, Judge Murray is building up ; and, if
the missionaries don’t ‘ set ’ him, and if the Common-
wealth Ministers give him proper backing, he will do
great things for Papua.
“One hears very little about the Gira goldfield
now. Many have left it during the last few months, but
there are still somewhere about 40 men there. This field
has lately been under a disadvantage. It has only the
one storekeeper ; and as the vessel belonging to that
storekeeper has been condemned in Samarai, the men on
Gira have been placed on short commons. A small
quantity of provisions is now reaching them in an oil
launch (the launch runs the mail contract); and even that
small quantity was curtailed by the loss of a cargo of rice
a short while ago.”

The proposal to turn over the Tewkesbury
Freehold, Tewkesbury, Freeburgh and Eurobin dredging
properties, Bright (Vic.), to a consolidated co., with head
office in Sydney, has gone wrong, One of the directors
of the Tewkesbury Freehold, who apparently believes
that it is cheaper to have four managements than one,
sought an injunction, and got it from Justice Hood. The
old cos. were to have an interest in the new co. (as well
as getting some cash); but Justice Hood said “the
majority cannot make the other shareholders partners in
a concern they never contemplated. If it were so, the
plaintiff might be forced into taking shares in a co.
formed for any purpose in another colony. He has
joined a no-liability co. here, but he might find himself
mixed up in a liability co. in N. S. Wales.” This decision,
if it stands, will affect amalgamations, etc., very seri-
ously. Apparently the decision doesn’t cover ordinary
“ limited ” cos., and that is some consolation. So far as
no-liability cos. are concerned, the trouble will arise
when some poor, hard-up co. has the choice between
utter collapse and amalgamation with, or absorption by,
some other co.—possibly to carry out work in which they
are both interested, and which may save the lives of
both, but which neither could, or would, undertake
alone. One obstinate shareholder may effectually block
amalgamation in such a case, and thus ruin the chances
of all.

There is a good deal of plain-talking in London
about the Victorian Star Gqld Mines, of Daylesford
(Vic.). The co. was pushed off some time ago, with a
capital of £150,000, to take over the Specimen Hill and
South Star; and, after getting an elaborate pumping
plant, etc., it was announced in London that the pro-
perties had closed down. What the Financial World
describes as a “notorious firm of share-pushers” lately
circulated a pamphlet boosting 1 the shares, largely on
the name of E. A. Wallis, described as “ managing
director in London of the Bank of Victoria,” who
was on the Board. As a matter of fact, Mr.
Wallis isn’t' “managing director”; he is London
manager, and it is most unlikely that he, as a bank
manager, would have joined the Board of a speculative
mining co. without receiving the permission—not to say
the instructions —of his own directors. The fact that the
business has turned out a fiasco, and that the London
papers have got on td it, makes the situation more awk-
ward for the bank ; and Shareholders might do worse
than inquire from Mr. Wm. Knox, Mr. Edward Miller, or
some other Bank of Victoria director, how the bank’s
London manager and the bank’s good name came to be
mixed up with the unfortunate affair.

“ One of the Vendors” : Re Clear Creek (Vic.)
float (B. 12/9/’O7). Why the correspondent therein men-
tioned should be so angry with this modest float is
beyond me. Re crushing a further lot. Had there been
a crushing mill anywhere handy, the vendors would not
have parted with their property. As it was, they arranged
with the only local man that owned pack-horses to pack
10 tons of quartz to the nearest mill .(three-head of
stamps), over four miles distant. Only 4J tons had been
dumped at the mill when the packer withdrew his team
for lighter and more lucrative work. This 4£ tons gave a
return of 3oz. 15dwt. I2gr. smelted gold. The vendors
received a one-fifth paid-up interest (no cash), and were so
satisfied with the prospects of the mine that they took up
one-sixth of the contributing shares. The best method
of proving this property is being carried on, as a shaft is
being sunk 100 ft. on the reef. There are 83 shareholders
in the co. (it could have been subscribed for twice over),
and £590 of the £6OO raised is in the Royal Bank, the
flotation exes, being £lO only, and the money is to be used
chiefly for paying miners’ wages.
The last occasion the South Star, Ballarat, came
seriously before the public was when some stone was
struck at 3100 ft., and a hifalutin message was sent to
Bent, on the strength of the £5OOO he had lent the co. for
shaft-sinking. Now there has been a little flutter because
gold has been seen in the stone at the bottom level.
Emery, the mine manager, plumped for this in his half-
yearly report, and he wrote on August 14: “ From the
present appearance of the bottom level, there is every
prospect of the coming term being of a profitable charac-
ter.” As the half-year’had ended with a bank overdraft
of £2385 and cheques outstanding £ll4O, in addition to
calls paid amounting to £3529, truly a little of something
was needed to brighten up the constellation.

The failure of Glassford Creek and Mt. Hector
is the most ghastly thing in Central Queensland mining
history for many years. Both shows have been kept
alive on newspaper gags and market deals, until
now neither newspaper nor market can hold the
things up any longer. The annual meeting of Glassford
Creek was pitiable. The report of the directors merely
referred shareholders to the report of Thomas Gibb,
behind whom the Board shelters itself. And Thomas
Gibb has in this case made a shocking miscalculation.
Twelve months ago he reported “ Since working two
shifts per day the furnace has smelted at the rate of 109-5
tons per 24 hours, so that, allowing 2000 of ore of similar
value (4-1 per cent, of copper) can be obtained monthly,
and I see no reason why this cannot be done, our produc-
tion of copper per month with the accompanying silver
and gold should be at least 80 tons, ' which at
present price of metals should be worth, on
the mine, £6650. Our expenditure should not exceed
£3500 per month, and we would, therefore, make
an annual profit of £37,800.” He now makes no apology
for allowing himself to be deceived into thinking that he
could take out of the Glassford workings per month 2000
tons of ore going 4.1 per cent, copper, nor does he say
where that anticipated profit of £37,800 has gone. It
cannot be urged that the price of copper is to blame,
for from the 10th September last until 30th June of this
year the copper market soared to intoxicating heights.
Who, or what, then, is to blame? At any rate, Glassford
has now come out of a fool’s paradise. During the year
its profit and loss account has gone further back by
£2107 ; and the indebtedness of the co. to the Q.N. Bank
has increased from £14,321 to £22,317. A further debit
may be expected from much of the matte now in transit
to Europe, so that there was no alternative but to close
down.
Mt. Hector (C.Q.), as The Bulletin forecasted,
is rapidly going the way of its twin brother, Glassford
Creek. In practically the same hands, and with pre-
cisely the same bad methods of administration, Mt.
Hector rattled up a furnace before it knew what ore there
was to smelt. It also went in for a bank overdraft, and,
what is worse, did riot call up the capital which might
have prevented any serious overdraft. Now, why does a
co. borrow- money quietly from a bank in preference to
making calls? And why have Mt. Hectors maintained
their high price on the market ? Mt. Hector’s profit and
loss account has reached a debit of £9069 ; and it owes
the A.J.S. Bank £4778. The calls available amount to
£4947. This will clear the bank ; but what about the
shareholders? They may as well write their stock off at
once.
Up to June 30 Mt. Hector smelted 1109 tons
ore, from w'hich the recovery w'as at the rate of 3-07 per
cent, copper, 14dw't. silver, and slightly over4dw't. gold
per ton of ore treated. Taking copper at £7O per toh,
which is quite high enough, and silver at 2s. 6d. standard,
that smelting mixture is worth £3 3s. lid. per ton.
Fancy anybody attempting such a ridiculous proposition
as Mt. Hector under those circumstances 1 The smelting
mixture for July on the same basis was worth £3 7s. 6d.
per ton recovered ; and twice that value would be little
or no good to Mt. Hector under present conditions. The
co. tried to have an annual meeting in Rockhampton
about a week ago, whereat the directors’ report was to be
read ; but the shareholders stayed away enthusiastically.
The report merely referred the shareholders to Thomas
Gibb, and the most noteworthy thing in Gibb’s report is
his reference to an ore that is “ cheaply worked and
delivered to the smelting w'orks ” ; and that ore “ contains
o'3 per cent, copper, traces of silver and gold, and
20 to 30 per cent, sulphur.” Even as a sulphur proposi-
tion!, Mt. Hector, judging from this, is not even third-
rate. The directors’ report did not include a recom-
mendation to close down. It should have done so.
Hector should suspend smelting at once, and put a man
on to find out what ore is available for a furnace. When
it has done that, it can quietly decide what sort of a fur-
nace it w’ants. Glassford Creek, by the way, had two
shots to decide what sort of a furnace it wanted, and
now it knows it did not want any. Hector has only
tried the reverberatory, so shareholders are still able to
hug the cold comfort that perhaps the other sort—a blast
furnace —might be better.

First-rate progress is being made with the con-
struction of the Cloncurry (Q.) railway, and unless the
wet season starts early and hampers work, a train will be
in at the head of the line by Christmas, as promised.
After that, there will certainly be much work to do, in
the shape of ballasting, etc. ; but even so it will be a fine
achievement, and tears to ribbons the ancient gag about
“ Government stroke.” The Mt. Elliott Co. wanted to
tap the line 70 miles or so down from its head, but
Government insisted upon the junction being at Clon-
curry. On the face of it, it looks a bit absurd to compel
a co. to pay for about 70 miles of unnecessary haulage
(the private connecting line would be about the same
length to either point); but Kidston took up the stand
that the line would want all the traffic it could get to pay
its way, seeing that high mineral freights will be
out of the question. The Elliott people replied that
they did not want the line to Cloncurry ; 70 miles short
of Cloncurry would suit them. To which the Govern-
ment’s rejoinder was that it was obviously either Clon-
curry or nothing—nobody would dream of carrying a line
all the way out from Richmond to the particular point
(the Gilliott) that suited Mt. Elliott best.
Nothing is, however, being done yet towards
building the Elliott and Hampden connections. The
money is available ; but it is understood that the cos.
are trying to get out of the Government the same sort of
interest-guarantee that the Chillagoe co. got in connec-
tion with the Etheridge line. It is time wasted ; Kidston
isn’t at all likely to do anything of the sort. The Govern-
ment wasn’t keen on the plan even so far as the Etheridge
was concerned, and the arguments that turned the scale
in that case don’t apply in these. Presumably, if the coa
got this guarantee, they would raise more money ; Hamp-
den then might use the money it has available to buy
other properties. And, from present appearances, it

the developments been poorer.
The Cloncurry field is getting short of water.
In some places old shafts have been cleaned out and the
mineralised liquid is being drunk—which means slow
poisoning. Cloncurry township itself is now dependent

For August Charters Towers (Q.) got down to
one poor little sixpenny div.—Brilliant Central (£2500).
The total for the year, so far, is £68,337, of which Mills’
United has given £30,000. Outside Pfeiffer’s there are
no bright spots showing, though prospects are a shade
better in half-a-dozen mines. At present more energy is
being shown in th“ Carrington group than anywhere
else : the United’s reverbs, will be finished some time next
month. But everywhere the copper lodes there keep
small.

After wasting about 18 months of a valuable
lead-zinc boom, sulking because it hadn’t been able to
impose its own conditions on its workmen, the Hercules
(Tas.) started early last December to break out ore
through a contractor. The co. has two sale-contracts in
hand—one to supply sulphides to the German works at
Zeehan, the other zinc-blende (300 tons a month for four
years) to a firm ip Germany. For the half-year ending
January last, the arrangements were too new to show a
profit of more than £lOl ; but for the past half-year the
co. is £8275 to the good, of which £5149 (Is. per share)
was divided and £257 went in dividend tax. It
took 8892 tons sulphides and 1827 tons zinc-blende
to produce this result, an average of a shade under 15s. 6d.
per ton. The 1827 tons of zinc-blende averaged oT7Boz.
gold, B’Boz. silver, and 41 - 7 per cent, zinc, and the co. got
for it £6052. (This ore has to be delivered at Burnie.)
The returning charges are tremendous. Giving all the
3280 z. gold and the 16,0090 z. silver in, the ore only
realised £7 18s. 6d. per ton gross for the zinc—and this at
a time when zinc averaged about £25 per ton. No doubt
there are heavy losses in zinc extraction ; but the figures
suggest, if not what great profits there are in the busi-
ness, at any rate what a fine labor-employer it is. But it
is German and Belgian labor that the Australian and
Tasmanian zinc ore employs—not Australian.

Can’t recommend it... Zeno : The thing to keep in mind
is that copper is only low now compared with a recent
short-lived boom quotation. After the boom of the late
’eighties it fell persistently until in 1894 G.M.B.’s were
down to £3B. It isn’t likely that anything so bad as that
will happen now ; still, in 1902, the quotation was as low
as £4sj, in 1903 £S2J, and in 1904 £S4J ; and in face of
those figures, the man who talks about £7O as a low price
is a guide who doesn’t look as though he had ever been
over the track before... .Shareholder : Bulletin didn’t
say that Hector had got “no money from the share-
holders or the mine.” What it did say was that it got
money which came from neither. And that’s the fact—
as at least one worried banker is able to vouch for.

Still another i n vention to do away with the clumsy
mine-signalling knocker. A Ballarat working jeweller
named Reigelruth is responsible for the latest idea. To
communicate with the engine-driver the man below
moves a pointer on a dial, and the pressure of a button
registers the same signal on a clock face under the eyes of
the driver; while the driver can signal to any level.
There is no limit to the number of signals that can be
sent, or the number of transmitting boxes, but only two
wires run down the shaft, and a small electric batterv
does the work.

The Aerial Tramways which have been erected
for the British and Sulphide Corporation (Central) Mines
at Broken Hill are fine examples of present-day skill and

saving by means of these Aerialways as compared with
any other known mechanical contrivance for handling
ores on a large scale. The British Mine will economise
to over 2s. per ton. These two plants have already been
subjected to severe tests, and have amply demonstrated
their worth and ability. Both Aerialways were supplied

Two sets of Improved Plunger Pumps, Cornish
type, are at present being constructed for the Victorian
Deep Leads G.M. Company (Messrs Bewick, Moreing and
Co.). Each set will consist of two lifts 250 ft., the total
lift being 500 ft. The Plungers are 26in. in diameter, and
each set of two delivers into one rising main, the dis-
charge per day being 5,000,000 gallons. The valve boxes
are made in separate pieces, and the valves are of the
double flap type. The total weight is 150 tons. There is
no balance weight in the bob, but the one set of pumps
balances the other. The Austral Otis Engineering Com-
pany have this work in hand. This Company has con-
structed and erected most of the big volume, deep
alluvial pumping plants now working in Victoria.*

“Vigilans”: Half Rocklands station is
situated in the Northern Territory, and the other
half in Queensland. Some 20,000 cattle depasture
here. For the Queensland portion the co. pays
7s. 6d. per square mile; for the Territory part,
Is. 6d. The best country is in the Territory, also
the greater portion of the herd. And people wonder
why, with its “ marvellous resources,” the debt of
the Territory runs into £4,000,000. Listen : On
the Tableland, a magnificent tract of country, the
huge runs of over 10,000 square miles pay a mere
nominal rent of Is. 6d., while on the Victoria
River, which is a continuation of the same belt,
they pay Is. There are few improvements or none,
and the country is only stocked near the water-
holes. ' The country is held by absentees, who do

Business Education.—A tree is known by its
fruit, a business school by its successes in public exami-
nations and the demand of business men for its gradu-
ates. In both these respects STott and Hoare’s Business
College stands at the head. A single instance will ex-
emplify the first claim : At all Government Examina-
tions for Shorthand Writers and Typists, held.during.the
past five years, students have won first place. As to the
second, not only does every student as soon as competent
secure an appointment, but the demand for graduates
greatly exceeds the supply. It is a mistake in these,
times to put a boy to business immediately he has passed
through his primary or high-school course ; years of
poorly-paid drudgery will be saved him, and his pros-
pects of advancement will be greatly enhanced by giving
him a sound modern business education at this well-
known institution. Prospectus post free. . 2S Moore

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : Let us consider the
pademelon vine. It is a prolific plant, which
bears little spiky melons about the size of goose-
berries. There are hundreds of acres of them
Outback, and countless patches of them Inback.
At first the vine is a rich green. When it fades
and withers, the wee melons remain. Western
men argue long and loudly about the effect of the
melons upon horses. Some settlers swear that
horses which eat the melons go totally blind ;
some say that the blindness is only partial and
temporary ; others aver that the blindness conn s
on only at night; others again maintain that the
horses can and do eat 'heartily of these melons
without any bad results. The State Veterinary
Surgeon was sent, a year'' or two ago, to Broken
Hill to investigate the melon-matter; but no official
report has yet been published. Coolibah Charlie
says that the melons were perfectly harmless
before the advent of the ruinous rabbit, which, in
his opinion, communicated some microbe to the
fruit, and so made it damaging to horses. A com-
mercial traveller on the coach said the melons
were all right till the new tariff came in. The
melon patches are great feeding grounds for the
galahs and the topknot pigeons. I have often
seen horses leave good grass to browse in the
melon patches. The melon seeds are extremely
bitter.
Twenty years ago Buninyong (Vic.) had
no Chinese, gardeners, or just about none. The
white men that were gardening then made a fair
thing out of it. But they wanted the earth, so they
took Chows on to work for them. They got John
for £1 a week, and John kept himself out of it,
whereas the white employee had got more than
double, so the boss saw great profit in the change.
A few years passed by, and the Buninyong Estate
was subdivided ; and the Chows clubbed together
and bought the pick of it. Then they left their
employers lamenting, and waded in. The Chow
association, under the name of Mow, Sang and
Co., practically collared all the vegetable-growing
industry. The 00. used to pay the poll tax on
batches of young Chows, which it imported direct
from China, and it used to work them seven
days a week, and from daylight till dark.
The white gardeners could not live against such
competition, and had to let a lot of their ground
go for grazing purposes, or sell it to the yellow
company. This Chow association kept adding to
its original block by buying up whatever land
came into the market. The Yellow Peril was
very real in Buninyong, but the Immigration
Restriction Act came along and saved one town
at least. It hit the leper company in the right
spot—its source of cheap labor, and great is the
difference made in these few years. The Chinese
co. now consists of two Chinamen who bought the
others out, and they have to employ white labor
at the usual white rates. The white gardeners
got a fresh start, and are easily holding their own
against Ah Sin now that they meet him under
similar conditions.

“ J.R.” : So The Bulletin (29/8/’O7) has
heard the stories of the new disease said to have
broken out among stock in western N. S. Wales,
and the conjecture that some of the Danysz
microbes may have got astray there. It is as well
to say that the microbe in question was discovered
by Koch of Berlin, and investigated by him and
Flugge, of Gottingen. Both say of this “rabbit-
killing-bacillus,” as Koch called it: —
Mice and birds (sparrows, pigeons, fowls) are as suscep-
tible as rabbits ; guinea-pigs and white rats are immune ;
dogs do not react on inoculation of small quantities, but
after subcutaneous injection of larger amounts an exten-
sive gangrene of the cellular tissue ensues, and the
animals die after two or three days.
That means that the bacillus will produce a
different disease in a dog from that caused in the
rabbit. Gould the microbe have been spread
from Broughton Island to the back country with-
out finding a home in the intermediate districts ?
It might, if the Broughton Islanders were quite
ordinarily careless. Anyone could go to the
island, and stay there for a day or two as a
visitor. The experimenters, or their assistants,
went to the mainland, and stayed there for longer
or shorter periods. It would have been the
easiest thing possible for a tube of culture to pass
for a more or less good reason into the hands of a
back-block squatter or his agent. On the face of
it, the experiments were carried out with curious
carelessness.

“ Dico ” writes from thereabouts
Camperdown (Vic.) is a quaint village. Thereabouts
reign some of the most notorious of the squatter lords —
the Manifolds, Chirnsides, Blacks. McArthurs, Curries,
Hopes, etc., and the whole place reeks of them and the
trail of their motah-cahs. The chief street is Manifold-
street, a fine wide, well-planted thoroughfare, its beauty
sadly marred, however, by a huge, slab-sided clock-
tower stuck fairly in the middle of it. This glorified
duck-house is of brick, and shaped like a squat, ill-
proportioned chimney. Its cost was borne 1 v a
Manifold, who did not forget to have the news of his
liberality engraved on a fine large block of stone set in
’ the base. It might have been designed by a royal
princess, so ugly is it. One cannot help wondering, as
he regards the useless shriek of vanity, what size of
a hospital the material would have made. Camperdown
has no hospital. The largest pub in Camperdown faces
the clock-tower, and irate, sleepless boarders often shy
curses, boots, and other futile weapons at the jangling
monstrosity, for it proclaims the time with vast discord
every quarter-hour, day and night. It does not say so on
the inscription, but I think the Fiend Himself designed
the arrangement of noises. Bung wanted to have the
row stopped, during the night at least, but the residents
shuddered at the sacrilege, and told one another in
horrified tones that it was a slur on the Manifolds. So in
the vote that was taken on the subject Bung got
smothered to the tune of about 700 to 2.
Did The Bulletin ever fall over a slumbering cow in a
dark street on a black night, and then get heaved
towards Heaven by the uprise of the bull’s aunt ? It’s a
rousing experience, and quite a common one in Camper-
down. There are cows evcryuftiere, and by a quaint
municipal arrangement they are allowed the freedom of
the city, so long as they wear round their necks a nice
brass chain and plate apiece (something like King Jerry’s,
of Wandijingolong), and pay to the council Od. per
month. They stand and gaze thoughtfully into the shop
windows, chew the 2s. lid. moleskins hanging at the
draper’s door, and scratch themselves against the clock-
tower. They’ll even sigh into your beer) if you forget to
close the pub door when going in.
I asked one intelligent-looking brindle why she and her
kind preferred the bare streets to the miles of rolling
grass-land round the town. She answered: “Them’s
squatters’ paddocks,” and adroitly licked a banana-peel
from the gutter. (This is no lie. It is a fable. And it has
a moral.)
The roads leading from Camperdown are models, unless
they are not used by the landlords ; then they are mud-
lioles. This will surprise no one, as a majority of the
shire councils consists of squatters and their humble
friends. They look on the roads as private motor-tracks,
and each has a specially-prepared strip running from the
main road to his front door. Once, a Common Person
drove a horse and dray across one of these strips. His
fate is shrouded in mystery, but some say that oft in the
stilly night a wild, despairing howl is heard from the
squire’s dungeon, or demijohn, or somewhere.

“ Nunawading ” : T. Ward, squatter,
Queensland, furnishes a valuable and informa-

trees at Dandenong (Victoria). Myers, as “ Tele-
machus,” brought these into more notice, after
Von Mueller had expatiated on them. They are
bigger than the Californian trees. The highest
tree of the Yosemite, says Ward, is only 376 ft.,
whereas some of the Victorians, he alleges, have
been measured up to 522 ft. ! Ward measured one
on the ground as 451 ft. These trees are being
rapidly exterminated. In 1890 there were thou-
sands "of them, to Ward’s personal knowledge,
over 400 ft. high, at Fernshaw. He measured the
girth of one, sft. above the roots, as 88ft. Planks
200 ft. long were cut. Twenty years ago the lyre
bird was plentiful round Fernshaw, but it is also
fast disappearing.

“ Lancewood ” : One hears a good deal
about white ants in North Queensland, but it is
evident they are not to be compared with their
brethren in the Territory. A portmanteau, con 7
taining various new articles of clothing, some
papers, books, and a number of small wares,
amongst which was a razor (a particularly good
one, too), was left by me at a police station, which
was afterwards temporarily deserted for want of,
water. I sent lately for the port., and received a
small parcel, containing some note-books and
horse receipts. These were all that remained.
Everything else, including the razor and a real
good portmanteau and a silver cigarette case and
some boots had been destroyed by white ants !
Yet the papers, which, as a rule, offer great
attractions to the insects, did not show even a sign
of their ravages. There wasn’t the mark of an
ant’s tooth any where. Is the white ant really a
policeman, and if so, why do policemen build these
amazing ant-hills that we see in pictures ?

“ Brad” writes :
Re Lancefield (Vic.) “ boasting a distinction rare among
places with English-sounding names ” (B. 5/9/’O7). Per-
haps it does ; but the town in question boasts a distinc-
tion rarer still (as far as Australians are concerned) than
being the only post town of that name in the world, inas-
much as near Lancefield are situated the famous “ black-
fellows’quarries” on Mount William, where both geolo-
gist and ethnologist find in small splinters and chips of
stone evidence which has helped to knock kite-high many
“ learned ” theories as to the origin and age of the dusky
race, as well as to illustrate their life and economy.
Standing in upright columns, like organ pipes, there is,
at one point of the range, a large outcrop of diorite
which every geologist worth his salt has mentioned, be-
cause there are very few others of the kind in Australia.
It was called “ the blackfellows’ quarries ” because it
was the source from which the native tomahawks
were spread throughout the country for hundreds of
miles. This diorite has a clear, metallic ring, more like
steel than stone, and partly finished heads may still be
picked up by Scores. All around the hill lie large mounds
of chips—hundreds of tons in bulk. I once found a stone
axe-head near Warrnambool (Vic.), and, was told by
Jimmy Gortwine, an old aborigine living on a mission
station down that way, that it originally came from
Mount William, over 200 miles distant. The natives must
have chipped and chipped here for generations to build
up such large mounds of diorite splinters. It would be
interesting to know whether one tribe held possession of
this stone peak and did an axe-export trade, or whether
all the tribes came there to make their weapons.
E. E. Hill, Bridgetown, W.A., writes ;
“From personal experience lean testify to the
efficacy of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. Last
winter I was troubled with a very bad cough, and
tried Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, which
quickly cured me, Now I keep a bottle on hand,
and take a dose. at. the first, symptom of a cold,
and have never since had a cold or cough.’"”
■ “Spring ” (at some length) :
There is in Sydney Botanic Gardens a lone satin bower-
bird, whose doings of late have attracted the genial per-
sonage who tends to his small wants. After a period
of cheerful indifference, the bird lately thought of build-
ing himself a bower, one of those bright and unique
triumphs of bird architecture which he recollected having
seen before his lamented captivity. With prodigious
energy he gathered twigs, and with much noise and gaiety
collected a few glinting ehanies and sparkling
bits of beer bottles on a piece of cloth. One
dav, while he was getting a sweat up and strongly
advising himself that there was nothing in the
world like work, he stopped to mop his heated
brow. His roving gaze fell upon two bright glinting
objects quizzing him from the entrance to a hole under a
shallow box in the corner. He thought they were bits
of glass, and bustled joyfully to add them to his collec-
tion.; but there was a slight scampering noise, and the
bright objects disappeared. The bird squinted down the
hole with curiosity, even as a pelican of the wilderness
looks into a drain-pipe in Philistia, and then went back
to his work with a puzzled pucker on his birdly forehead.
Every now and again he would whip round to discover
the two fascinating objects glinting at him, andhe would
dash to collect them, only to discover the usual empti-
ness. This went on all the afternoon. He began
to perspire freely 7, although his work was not hard
or the sun hot. Frequently he knocked off
altogether, and flew' up to a small mirror in his domain,
and was horrified at the change in his appearance. His
satiny coat had lost some of its gloss, and his general
appearance suggested that he had been on a nights
scoot. He looked as if £1 wouldn’t be nearly enough to
send to Dr. £. £. When he went to bed he dreamed
about those two bright objects in the corner. In
the morning he fairly collapsed w'hen he found that
his precious collection of ehanies had been dragged about
the place and scattered. He talked excitedly to a couple
of starlings. Presumably they couldn’t solve the riddle,
for upon their departure he cast cold glances upon his
bower, and refused to take any interest in his grub.
During the next night the grub disappeared. The keeper
was not at first aware of the great sorrow that had come
over his charge, simply' imagining that the bird
had fallen in love with his ideal and .wanted
to get spliced, for it is the season when the sap climbs up
the tree and the pretty wooing birds select the tall
arboraceous vegetable that the wicked boy can’t climb.
Ultimately, however, the keeper investigated, with the
result that he uprooted an extra out-size in bush rats
from underneath the box. After that the bird resumed
his usual attitude of cheerful philosophy. He told the
starlings that work is a mocker and once a bloke takes off
his coat he’ll have to keep it off, and that while you’re
slogging into it someone else is selling your wife’s time
payment jewellery or stealing the mat off the front step.
He took no more interest in the bower ; therefore I, for
one, can’t supply “Jimmie Pannikin” with a genuine
photo of a bower bird’s nest or any other kind of photo.

“ Polstan ” : As the person who started
the stink-wort row, will you permit me a couple of
final comments? First, as to “Revolo,’' the
awful vegetable’s main champion and the malig-
nant who would fain establish that healthy stock
eat stink-wort. Let me tell “ Revolo ” that many
horses will shy if driven within 200yds. of a stink-
wort paddock, and they can smell a stink-wort
admirer half a mile away, and will then—accord-
ing as the latter is behind or ahead of them—
either bolt or jib. Secondly, let me do stink-wort
itself the parting justice to say that—unlike
“Revolo”—it has a sense of humor. It first
made its appearance in the Mount Hoogly dis-
trict at the now-defunct Government scent-farm,
where it throve like a professional convert, and
in a short space outsmelt the local Secesh leader
and the chief Stinking Fisherman of the district.

The quiet, respectable man-about-town ;
Long done with the hurries of life’s little worries,
The well-to-do Rafferty, quite settled down ;
Yet the soul of him ever was fain to the fever ;
The squelch of the cradle was part of his dreams ;
lie saw the stars winking from shafts he was sinking ;
He dwelt in the tents by the clay-colored streams.
Despite the years, burning great hopes were returning ;
He remembered old wash-dirt and country untried,
Likely pockets and catches, alluvial patches,
And the old miner’s soul of him clamored and cried.
The cry of the rush to him, call of the bush to him,
The windlass, the bucket, the lights on the lode 1
So out of the highways, and into the byways,
In search of old ventures, Mick Rafferty rode.
As journeys some sleeper, still on, ever deeper,
Led forward by fancies, and lit by romance,
Filled high with elation, by township and station,
He heard the winds sigh, and he saw the stars dance.
At night the dews falling, at morn the birds calling ;
The sweet scent of gum leaves, the fervor of noon ;
At twilight’s abating resonant vibrating
Of locusts ; the rise of the crescented moon.
And deeper and deeper, by tracks that were steeper,
He wended his way as he wended of old ;
He wound and he skirted past diggings deserted,
Through treacherous gullies ransacked of their gold.
By old holes in-slidden, grown over and hidden,
The hummocks of wash-dirt, the throats of old shafts,
Underground and still lurking in drive and in working,
He conjured dim spectres engaged at their crafts.
* • * *
On those diggings deserted a miner, red-shirted,
Still fossicks and scrapes where the former age mined.
But doubtless some plucky past digger, turned lucky,
Rejoiced thereabouts in a fortunate find.
He lives there, and daily goes pottering gaily,
Old citizen Rafferty, searching for gold,
His tent to the south of it, close to the mouth of it,
The claim where he worked with his partner of old !
Each day as he goes there, more feeble he grows there ;
Yet there are contentment and joy in his face.
The old spirits lurk with him, mate with him, work
with him,
And youth has returned—in his dreams—for a space.
Perchance when forsaking the city, and taking
The old ways, he dropped on his luckiest lode ;
When out of the highways, and into the byways,
In search of contentment Mick Rafferty rode.

How is it that while many tin-pot town-
ships in Australia have several names to choose
from, some of our important towns have to share
their one name with another town ? Letters
addressed to Maryborough, Australia, often find
their way to the town in Victoria, when they are
meant for the Queensland seaport. Others
addressed to Newcastle are delivered at Coalo-
polis instead of at the Westralia place. Some
time ago, the captain of a barque lying in Maori-
land waters received orders from the owners to
proceed to Geraldton, where a cargo would be
awaiting him. After battling against head winds
and tides for three weeks, he arrived in the
vicinity of Geraldton, on the north Queensland
coast. To his disgust, he found that he was
wanted at the port of Geraldton, north of Fre-
mantle.

“Southern Cross”: Be “J.G.” (B.
7/8/’O7) and the land-boiler’s liability to “ bust.”
I knew a chap who backed a 5-horse power engine
to do the work that a saw-mill proprietor was
getting out of a 14-horse power. A wager was
committed, and the owner of the 5-horse power
gave his engine driver strict orders not to let the
saw-mill man “head a log in” till there was
steam up like unto the smoke of Sheol. The
decisive moment arrived. “ Whip your log into
the saw,” said he of the 5-liorse power. That log
soon became planking, and when another and
another followed the astonished saw-mill pro-
prietor gasped, “How much steam have yer got
on”? “Dunno,” came the answer, “but this is
the third time the blooming hand’s been round
the dial of the steam gauge.”
Hits BRIGHT IDEA.
SALVATION SAM : “Oh, I don’t know what to do
with you, brother. The drink is driving you
down, down, down !”
BOOZER M‘GEE (happy thought): “I know—
sh’pose we try a (hic) pick (hic) pick-me-up ?”
“ Groper ” : Lindsay’s picture of the cocky
poking fowls off the roost is no exaggeration.
Knew a cocky once whose habit was to get up
about 3 a.m., light his fire, and then disturb the
poultry. If he saw a horse or a cow lying down,
he’d wake it also. (He is said to have once
wakened a sleeping bee.) Then he’d have break-
fast and wait for dawn. As far as I can recollect,
he never employed any labor. He had no man
whom he could waken early, and he had to rouse
something.
DREADFUL THOUGHT.
Anxious Wipe (to husband about to undertake his first ride): “Now, you Jim, you, gimme
your promise, fer the sake o’ your wife an’ fambity—you gimme yer promise not to scorch.”
“ Quan ” : A dingo happened along at
Dunbible, near Murwillumbah (N.S.W.) the
other day—the middle of the day, too —grabbed
an alleged 401 b. pig, and decamped. The owner
of Walking Pork was too flabbergasted by the
audacity of the dingo to do more than heave
stones at him. I had a notion that in the matter
of pig the dingo had religious scruples; but
maybe this dingo had ’verted.
* * * *
“Mo ” : Be various inodes, and weird, of
out-back travelling. A shearing-shed loafer I
know goes from one loaf to another (he never
takes a job) preceded by a small
box on perambulator wheels,
drawn on alternate days,
when the weather is nor-
mal, by a goat and a
dog. The vehicle con-
tains the traveller’s
swag—nothing more.
Asked him once if
it wouldn’t be more
simple to carry the
swag, to which he
replied languidly:
“Some might think
so. I don’t.” Then,
rousing himself with
an effort, he in-
formed me that when
hot weather pre-
vailed the goat
(which felt the heat
but little) was sole
occupant of the
shafts. The dog (a
lover of coolth) was
attached on such
occasions to a pole
projecting some 4ft.
or 5ft. behind the
cart, to which was
fastened, sail-like, a
piece of calico. This
apparatus, the owner
explained, threw a
shade just in front of
the dog, and as the
caravan moved onwards
that animal, by contin-
ually making for the
shade, contributed its share
towards the progress of the
cart. The inventor, who
takes a weary sort of pride in
his complicated fakement, having
demonstrated thus far, was over-
come once more with utter tiredness,
and yawned cavernously several times, and sub-
sided in silent reverie against a post.
“Pick”: “ Michael Carr ” has earned my
approving pat on the back for his par (B. 5/9/ 07)
anent the senseless killing of bush animals. The
considerations which prompted him to keep off
the boko of the porcupine slayer were also those
that recently deterred me from visiting, with one
j n the floating rib, a waster I met in the bush who
had just slaughtered a native bear. It was the
first bear I had seen for years, though at Hall’s
Hill (Shoalhaven district, N.S.W.) I once counted
80, without moving off the rock on which I stood,
On the Mountain Ash Range (Monaro) I have
seen 500 kangaroos in a mob. One could now
search there for a week without finding a ’roo.
Squatters’greed, phosphorus poisoning, and fur-
hunters are making our native fauna extinct as
the moa, and it is about up to the Government
to see about giving a show to the few animals
that remain.
“Flinderino” : Marram grass is playing
an important part in the reclamation of lands
along the foreshore in the Western District- of
Victoria. A few years ago valuable land near
Warrnambool and Port Fairy was being gradually
eaten into by the sea, and the encroaching sand
caused alarm. On the advice of the Government
Botanist, marram grass was cultivated. This
proved so effective a barrier that where for years
nothing but shifting sands prevailed, crops are
now grown with success. Marram grass thrives
in all climates, and seems practically indes-
tructible. Burning off or cutting down only
makes it grow more thickly. Cattle appear to
like it, but it is a trifle too tough for them. Large
parcels of this grass have been sent from Port
Fairy to Westralia and some of the other States,
and in almost every instance it is giving entire
satisfaction.

From a man with a hobby :
Artesian water has generally been found, in Australia,
to contain so much alkali that it rapidly cakes the
ground and stops all capillary attraction. In fact, at the
Pera bore (Par West N.S.W.) the soil became so hard that
it was almost impossible to cultivate it in the usual way.
Besides, the presence of carbonate of soda in the soil is
injurious to plant life. In order to remedy this, an
officer of the N.S.W. Department of Agriculture has been
experimenting, so far most successfully, with nitric acid.
Taking soil impregnated with the sediment from alkaline
bore water, and adding nitric acid to some of the pots
containing it, he found that wheat showed vast improve-
ment where the acid had been added. Thus a very
wide paddock for further research has been opened up.
It is propos and to establish a plant at a'n artesian station
for the manufacture of electro-thermal nitric acid from
the atmosphere. This process is already in use in Germany,
where the acid has been made at a cost of about £7 per
ton, and there the water power cost £4 per ton. If works
were established at the high-pressure bores in Australia,
the process ought to be cheap, as the power is free. The
carbonate of soda being in the bore-water will also cost
nothing, and the atmosphere is still free, although J.
Carruthers appears to have an idea that there’s a duty
on that, too, “for the benefit of Victorian manufac-
turers.” The result of the mixture of nitric acid and
carbonate of soda is nitrate of soda, which is one of the
most valuable as well as costly of all artificial fertilisers.
So there is the possibility of the Australian artesian dis-
tricts becoming fertile wheatlands.

“ Barb ” : The magpie is a hard case. The
other afternoon I watched five of him feeding on
a fiat. Bronzewings and p irrots searched along-
side for scattered thistle seed, and flocks of wee
birds flitted in the leafless briars. The mags fed
on, chattering contentedly'. A crow descended
in their midst, and, with warlike yells, the whole
five tackled him and drove him skyward. Up
there he met and apparently gave offence to a
sparrow-hawk, for it attacked him viciously. The
mags, with loud screeches, rose to the fray, and,
befriending their late foe, drove the sparrow-hawk
into oblivion. The crow, cawing indignantly,
settled on a dead gum to rearrange his plumage,
and the mags again descended to the flat. Down
the gully a hare came tearing, with an eagle-hawk
almost on him. Once more the mags gave out
their war-cry, and that eagle promptly left for
other parts. An aggressive but lovable bird is
mag.
THE DERELICT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He crept, soft-footed, from the outer gloom,
And sate him down apologetic’ly
Upon the hardest chair in all the room,
And from its edge extreme he blinked at me.
Blear’dly he blinked—his trembling hands the while
Fingered the brim of what was once a hat,
Whilst I, observing closely, in his style
Found quite a fund of things to marvel at.
“ At last,” I cried, “ thou eloquence of Woe ;
Thou tarnished glory of a day that’s gone ;
Thou drear configuration ; thou sworn foe
To smiles and mirth ; thou precis of the Wan ;
“ Thou fleshly rival to phantasmal Care,
Skulking abroad like Gloom made visible ;
Thou Misery, thou Bleakness, thou Despair,
Thou antitype of all things risible ;
“Thou Dreariness —but stay, I’ll stop at that,
If you will tell me what you’re seeking here."
His hollow voice replied, “ I want a ‘ sprat ’ —
I’m dyin’, boss, God’s truth, for wanter beer ! ”

Billo: You think the Australian Parliament
should have taken a referendum of its constituents before
raising its salary. Perhaps it should—but did you ever
find a landlord taking a referendum of his tenants before
raising his rents?.. ..Thespian : VVe pay for accepted
matter, but you haven’t struggled into the acceptance
line yet... .A.M.M. : Thanks for good wishes, even though
the pars missed fire Gryffd ap Llewellyn : Dunno.
This isn’t our day for ancient history... Pat Nolan : Tub
Bulletin is in favor of paying members of the Australian
Parliament £1000 a year, not a mere £000. Therefore
your “poem” is torn up J. W. Ward : Thanks
Minerva: (1 and 2): No, not at that season, anyhow.
Probably not at any season, but the best chance is at
mid-winter, when the sand is fairly firm. You might
dodge the sand-hills, but you couldn’t dodge sandy
creek-beds. (3 to 7): As you are never likely to get
there, it is hardly worth hunting up those details
JamesM‘G.: “Bill Sykes” is poor verse and a foolish
idea. How could the Federal members have gob the
authority of the people at a general election for their
increase of salary ? It would only have made one more
question amid the dozen or two dozen that were thrown
into the political welter. If you could persuade all the
candidates to speak of nothing but the rise of salary, then
you would get a verdict —that is to say, you would get a
Parliament with authority to increase its pay and do
nothing else for three years, or else a Parliament with a
mandate to leave its pay at the old figure, and do nothing
at all for three years. In any case, the pay ought to be
£1000 a year. Then we might get men strong enough
to cope with certain importers who have been raising
their salaries without authority of late Matchbox:
Didn’t manage to strike a light onyou Wang : Believe
the concern to be a poor, incompetent swindle....
K. : Not a very promising brace of suggestions
O. W.T.: That joke was worked hard all through the re-
cent drought, and deserves a rest J.B. : “Sighs of a
Citizen ” sort of missed the target. But it struck a cow
that was grazing close at hand, so don't lose heart
L. : Hebrew joke declined. Don’t think you
really know any Hebrews Tomki : The man who
sends a newspaper clipping in one envelope, and sends in
a second envelope a letter to say that the clipping is on
its way in the first envelope, possesses a capacity for
work which fills us with envy. We never had the energy
to send a herald, or forerunner, or advance agent, or
pilot engine, or John the Baptist in front of a mere clip-
ping R.J.S.: Song about a deceased bigamist thrown
out... .Tom Long : Yes, the readers are numerous enough
to make a very convincing political party. Trouble is
that readers aren’t always believers... .E.F.V.: The
parallel is hardly close enough The Bud: “Stars”
poetically treated, bub holds no distinct idea.... D. M. R.:
That notion has been worked before, and better
Kona: Might be w’orse for a first attempt. No; we
don’t think the articles you suggest would suit us....
Alis : Perilously akin to nonsense F.K.C. : Not good
enough, and cost us 4d. short postage... .Nils N.: Very
crude and unskilful O’Keilly : Advocacy of church
roof garden out of this paper’s line. Why climb on
to a roof after a garden in this country,
when all the bush is on the ground floor?
Nasus : Your trouble isn’t over-condensation as you seem
to think, but lack of it; 550 words to intimate that a
confidence man visited your town and took it down in
the good old way is just about 525 words too many....
Ratoon: No trace of anything with that signature
A. Kinross: Thanks for poetry samples, but this paper
doesn’t reprint verse except for cuss purposes F.:
Your suggested alterations whereby a reference to Aus-
tralia may be dragged into “Gor’save” are quite awful.
’Frinstance, “ Of our great British Lion, Make us a worthy
scion, God Save the King” is worse than anything in the
lamentable original... .N.Z.A.R. : All these aspects of
the case had been dealt with in the office before your
belated item arrived... .Ferrit: Hardly good enough for
print M.R.M. : Well-meant, but very badly done....
J.K.W. : That ridiculous statement has been already
dealt with Peter P. : Received Onega: Interest
too purely local L.K. : Too tamely told Ivy P. :
Pretty, but conventional. Try a less hackneyed theme.
....Boolara: Required more s irited treatment
Vinco: Admirable matter, but hardly suitable for The
Bulletin. Have forwarded it on to the National Defence
League paper, The Gall....Mrs. J. H. P. : You versify
well, but your subjects don’t impress us W H.X. :
Glimmers of goodness only... .Oasuarina : They don’t
get above 3rd class... Lai D. : It has some lyrical quality,
bub is otherwise undistinguished C.T.N. : They have
“ go,” but the workmanship is crude... .Lottah : Rather
graceful in form, but the idea is too vague and elusive...
Billee : “ Worm ” is not far short of the mark, but they
both travel too much on conventional lines Brad":
Regret both suggestions missed fire. Powder damp, or
something A.J.P. : There are many things we have to
omit for lack of space, and a chess column is one of
them. VVe have a firm conviction that it is up to White
to move, but we want him to move right up into the
Northern Territory and build a transcontinental railway.
. ...W.K. : “Wilks” is too rocky in the metre, which
makes us grieve, for it is full of noble sentiments
Australian 1st: Very inferior work C.L.M. : Don’t
care much forit C.G.S. : Quite devoid of quality...
H.W.P. : Obviously—not to say impudently—founded on
a recent Bulletin story to the same effect Bendemeer:
All the weak poets in Australia seem to have had a go at
the Yellow Peril subject. Leave it to bards of greater
tonnage....C.R.N. : Rather obscure. How did the
young fellows burst the Sunday monotony ?
TO ARTISTIC! (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Culwulla : Just a dim pencil sketch of a girl—very dim.
J.C.: Picture of two dirty men talking about soap
declined... .Henry C. : Pictures not much account. Also
one joke not of much account; the other good but worn
out....Cod: One may possibly serve as a suggestion.
No name or address given.... Brad: Nothing rare or
wildly humorous about “ Polling Day.”
“ Oby ” : We are only gradually climbing
up to the blackfellows’ regard for the native
timbers. The aborigines treated the white man’s
practice of miscellaneous tree slaughter as a crime,
and used to resist it wherever possible. Among
themselves the blackfellow who cut down a tree
on the land of another tribe was killed when
caught, and only when the elders decided that a
tree was dead was it allowed to be cut down for
firewood even by the tribe that owned the ground.
Much of the bloodshed of the early Queensland
settlements was caused by the action of the white
men in cutting down the pines on the Mary River.

SOME CURRENT EVENTS.


The secret of beauty lies to a great extent
in the beauty of the teeth. The teeth are to the face what flowers
are to the garden—the finest ornament. The care of the teeth is there-
fore of vast importance to the preservation of beauty. The liquid
dentifrice, Odol, is the best preservative,’for it not' only cleanses the
teeth, but also insures them against decay.
Odol, as has been scientifically proved, penetrates the interstices of
the teeth and the mucous membrane of the mouth, to a certain extent
impregnating them, and thus securing a safeguard and preservative for the
teeth such as no other dentifrice can provide, not even approximately.
When the teeth are cleansed
with Odol the whole month
is rejuvenated as the body
is by a bath.

EX-POLICE MAGISTRATE PANTON, OF
MELBOURNE.
The brief record of the pious ex-Sal va-
t’onist Bruntnell in N.S.W. politics: Didn’t get
in, July, 1904; got in, July, 1906; got out, Sep-
tember. 1907.
The N.S.W. Assembly now only holds one
double, there being two Millers, though there is
also a Grahame and a Graham. The two Youngs
who sat in last Parliament were both defeated
while of the double-barrelled John Perry, only
one barrel got back.
T. A. Dibbs, the grand old man of the
Australian banking profession, has celebrated the
60th year of his service with the Commercial
of Sydney by a cheque for £SOOO. The annual
interest on this sum is to be devoted to assisting
officers of the bank in time of misfortune.
Melbourne Court loungers grinned the
other day at the spectacle of the captain of a
British ship disputing a laundry bill of 45., and
thereby detaining the ship and chancing an
allegedly possible loss of £50,000. The skipper’s
name was Tonald, ye ken—Tonald Mcßryde.
Cardinal Moran entered his 78th year on
Monday, and Chief Justice Darley did ditto on
Wednesday. Judges of Irish origin have a habit
•of clinging to office until nature gives way. Chief
Justice Darley had an uncle who held office as a
•County Court Judge in Ireland when he was
.steadily climbing up to the nineties.
The most versatile of Australia’s present
Premiers isKidston, of Queensland. He began with
.a big hammer in an iron-foundry, and soon became
expert as a maker of iron goods. He qualified as
an analytical chemist. He qualified as a compe-
tent dentist. Then he turned bookseller. Finally,
he became a politician and a Premier, and as he
is still under 60, he appears to have done pretty
well on the whole.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy banishes all
tendency toward pneumonia.*
Avery ancient, quiet person has gone over
at Shellharbor (N.S.W.) —one Smith, who was
born in England and came to N. S. Wales with
his wife and two children in 1831. He lived in
the Illawarra district for 73 years, and at quiet,
dreamy, unprogressive Shellharbor for 50 years, for
27 of which he was secretary to a little local boat
service. He was 95 years old when he decided
that it was a fair thing.
Dr. Doss, of Molong, one of the old
identities of N.S.W. politics, has to hunt about
for small bits of fame these days. Announced
that he has had a Grand document from the Grand
Recorder informing him that the Grand Master of
the Grand Encampment of Temple and Malta in
Scotland has made him Grand Representative of
the Grand Encampment in Australia. This seems
to be a shade lower than a K.C.M.G.
The S. M. Herald (14/9/’O7) solemnly re-
corded the death of an old Maori lady who was,
it said, “considerably over 100,'“ and “well re-
membered the second visit of Captain Cook.” As
that was about 134 years ago, it seems that the
ancient character really died at the age of about a
century and a half. These ancient inhabitants
should be taken with a quantity of salt, as the
Maori used to do when he cooked his friend.
John Garland, of Sydney, has the bad
luck to have the Parliamentary door again
slammed in his face —this time by Dick Meagher.
His lost chances are counting up. On two
occasions he was Attorney-General designate, but
the door slammed. Wade is likely to skip to the
Bench the first chance, and there might have been
a- hope for Garland, barrister-at-law, but the
blessed door blew shut again.
Dr. J. L. McKelvey, Demonstrator in
Anatomy at the University of Sydney, has been
appointed Medical Superintendent of the Mel-
bourne Hospital. Dr. McKelvey was born at
Ravenswood (Q.), and educated at Townsville
Grammar School. All his medical training was
got at Sydney University. His appointment to a
big Melbourne position is probably another wrong
to the Ma State, when Carruthers has time to
think it out.
“Cockaigne”: Grayson, the first Marxian
person returned to the British Parliament, is to
the English press like boiling water on an ant-
heap. He is only 25 ; but Pitt was Premier at
24, and held on 17 years. At 14, Grayson was a
stowaway aboard ship at Liverpool. .The en-
raged skipper put him ashore at Tenby, and he
had to walk 200 miles home. He studied with a
view to being a Unitarian preacher, hut grew out
of it. Most eloquential.
One of the most cheering exhibits at the
recent Parkes (N.S.W.) show was of the human
breed—a Mrs. Sheppard, to wit, who, though
cetnt 78, secured several special prizes for her
riding feats. Afterwards she gave an exhibi-
tion of horsemanship, and ended up with a
gallop round the ring that took the crowd im-
mensely. The country that produces this sort of
old lady isn't as dead and useless as the Freetrade
interests would make out—not by the length of
several big snakes.
After pegging out many claims, Thomas
Barnfield, mine promoter, pegged himself out
recently at Adelaide, aged 05. He came to
Victoria when a youth, and operated with more
or less success in the innards of Ballarat when it
was a baby, instead of the gigantic auriferous
corpse it is now. Later on he moved to N.S. W.,
and floated and took a barrelful of shekels out of
the Baker’s Creek (Hillgrove) mine ; he also
promoted the Adelaide co. that opened up the
Eleanora in .the same locality. He settled in
Adelaide in 1873, and arrived “away up ” among
the Stock Exchange folk. One of his last opera-
tions was the flotation of a co. to work the china
clay deposits on Kangaroo Island.
T. I. Joynt, K.C., one of the most con-
spicuous and brilliant members of the Bar in
Maori land, died at Christchurch on the sth. He
was born at Dunmore (Ireland), 75 years ago, and
came to Canterbury (M.L.) as one of the. early
settlers, arriving in Lyttelton as far back as 1856.
He was prominently associated with the law from
that date until his death. Probably he defended
more murderers than any other lawyer in Maori-
land, being connected with all the most impor-
tant criminal and civil cases heard at Christchurch
during the last thirty years. He had a great
reputation throughout the Dominion as a hard
fighter and an eloquent pleader. It would be
interesting to know how much hard cash
Costs was instrumental in depositing, during the
last 40 years, on the departed lawyer’s doormat.
“ Dico’s ” tale :
The fact that the Ballarat match has been cut out of
the list of fixtures for the next English XI. reminds me.
Old man Grace was once playing in Ballarat against a
local horde, and the Ballarat umpire had the dreadful
temerity to give him out l.b.w. W.G. nearly “bust.”
After gasping and spluttering for a few minutes, he
started to hurl insulting epithets at the umpire ; and,
when some of the fieldsmen mildly interrupted, rounded
on them, and offered to play the whole crowd with a
broom-handle. Then he returned, snorting, to the
pavilion, and sat there howling “ Not out! ” every time
there was an appeal to the umpire. The day was hot and
dusty, and towards the end of the innings Grace went
into the bathroom for a shower. Suddenly, above the
swish of the water, he heard a unanimous “How’s
that?” from the field. Clothed in nothing but his
whiskers, the G.O.M. bounded to the door, and hauling it
open, roared a final and triumphant “ Not out! ” Then,
composed and happy, he started to re-fill his duds.
Harry Levien, father of N.S.W. Assembly,
returns from Tamworth with a nearly 2 to 1
majority. It never seems to matter to Harry
what sort of politics he professes.
The electors knowing him simply
as Harry, and apparently will
vote for him as long as
he is Harry. It is now
close on 27 years since
Levien began to shove
the legislative vehicle
along in N.S.W.
POOR JOE! WHAT A LIFE!
A newly-elected M.L.A. in Bananaland
recommended a supporter as a J.P. So the local
policeman was called upon to report, as usual.
“ This gentleman is well known to the police and
everyone else,” he wrote. “So far, he has stolen
no horses in this State.’’ So Smith is now a
terror to the local drunks.
“ Melb.” : Butters says that McCulloch, as
Premier, and Higinbotham, as Attorney-General,
going home by the last Brighton train, used to
b ly saveloys and hot rolls, and eat them in the
guard’s van. Then there was Mayor Gatehouse,
who rode home towards Toorakia at one o’clock
in the morning on a saveloy machine.
“ Melb.” writes :
Last week’s obituary included Dr. Lalor, aged 48,
Peter’s only son. A handsome fellow, not a morsel
like his dad ; he must have taken after the mater, like
Melba. Only three Australian statues thrill me —the
Cook, in Sydney, the Burke and Wills, in Melbourne, and
the Lalor, at Ballarat,' gazing from Sturt-street to the
Eureka. Peter Lalor was of sound, Sensible, rebel stock.
His father had more influence than any other single indi-
vidual to obtain the abolition of tithes. His cattle being
clawed therefor, he branded them on the horns with
“ Tithe.” Nobody in Ireland dared to buy them. It is
claimed that his brother was the real originator of
George’s “ Progress and Poverty.” Peter wobbled in
Victorian politics, and was a kind of Tory till he settled
down to work with Berry. As Customs Commissioner he
is thought to have egged on Black Wednesday more than
anyone. He was the best of Victorian Speakers. Bent
was the worst.
“S. Snell” in a carping mood :
I am not worrying myself about Tom Bent’s want of
dignity, being satisfied that Tom would be a much more
grotesque Premier than he is if he added pom to his
other sins, but I do think he deserved to be butted
violently in the buffer by a battering ram for the hideous
attempts he made to give out a true Australian coo-ee at
Wren’s wood-cutting carnival, the other night. As a
possible national Australian war-whoop, the coo-ee is
deserving of respectful treatment, but Tommy Bent’s
first effort was like the young and early Wyandotte
trying to imitate the clarion of his fathers. Then
Tom tried again, and the spasm of row that flew out of
his head was the shriek of some strong woman in her
agony suddenly strangled with a dishcloth. Tommy
tried.a third time. His face was purple, his eyes stood
out like the antennae of a lobster, his veins knotted, and
a dreadful catastrophe seemed imminent. Then the
coo-ee was published, and it was an infamous squeak.
The great bull voice was used up. As a mass of material
plunged in silence I can bear with Bent, but he can’t
coo-ee worth eightpence.
Two new members of the N.S.W. As-
sembly have family records dating from the very
early days. Colonel Onslow, who displaced
Tommy Jessep at Waverley, is a great-grandson
of John Macarthur, a lieutenant in the 102nd
Regiment, who arrived in 1790. He became pay-
master of the corps, and retired therefrom to
become father of the wool industry, though
Parson Marsden’s descendants dispute the claim.
John Miller, who succeeds W. W. Young at
Bathurst, is a great-grandson of John Piper, who
was an ensign in the same corps, and served at
Norfolk Island in the early days. He was then
appointed IS aval Officer, or Collector of Customs.
In 1827 his accounts were found to be a trifle out.
The shortage was £27,000, which, it is understood,
was made good by the sale of Vaucluse (to W. C.
Wentworth) and Point Piper. So high was the
esteem in which he was held, despite the brevity
in his cash, that when he decided to start dairy
farming at Alloway Bank, near Bathurst, his
friends in Sydney gave him a grand banquet and
send off. He was exceedingly popular on the
turf and in society, such as it was. And, after
all, the deficit was only £27,000.
Of the-90-members- of the newly-elected
Assembly of N.S.W., 71 have had previous Par-
liamentary experience, though not all in the last
Parliament. Among “back numbers” who
successfully appealed are John Norton! R. IX
Meagher, " Jimmie ” Graham, Varney Parkes,
Brown, R. A. Price, and J. C. L. Fitzpatrick
(Orange). Amongst old hands who applied but
are still in the cold are Garland, Crick, Brnnt-
nell, Archer, Haynes, Hawthorne, Terry, Rae,
Rose, T. R. Smith, Fitzpatrick (Wagga), Wall,
G. IX Clark, Black, Conroy, Carroll, Byrne, A.
Campbell, and Pyers ; while the roll of ancients
who have been thrown out is long, and includes
John Hurley, Law, W. Anderson, Jessep, Booth,
Bill Young, Fegan and others.
The stringent remarks of one of the Judges
who composed the N.S.W. Full Court at the
recent killing of a solicitor recall the fact that he
was not always .such a stickler for strict probity.
Just before he was elevated to the Bench he re-
ceived a brief from a well-known firm of solicitoi s,
glanced at the names, and dropped it into his
drawer. When he was elevated he wrote to the
solicitors stating that as he had been appointed to
the Bench he could not, of course, act, but as he
had perused the brief he considered he was entitled
to his fee, and he would be glad to hear from the
firm in the matter. He did. Next day came a
deliciously brief reply which read. “ Dear Sir, —
In reply to yours of in re So-an-so versus
Thingumbob. If you will kindly open the brief
you will find the cheque enclosed. Yours, etc.,
Dodson and Fogg.”
By a legal man :
Justices G. B. Simpson and Cohen are said by clothes
experts to be the best dressed men in N.S.W. Justice
Simpson, on emerging from the Divorce Court, strolls on
the block. He is a noble sight. Justice Cohen is not
so frequently seen “down town.” But he walks in at
times from Elizabeth Bay and out again. There is a
staidness and steadiness in the wearing of Justice
Cohen’s hat Which contrasts with the jaunty,
right-on-one-side way of the Simpson tile. This
may result from the frivolous nature of the work in
the Simpson jurisdiction. Justice Cohen, engaged in
solemn, stodgy contract and tort matters, and disputes
about compensation and damages, must be expected to
have a staider air than a man who is daily engaged in
hearing the flippancies of life laid bare, and contem
plating the extreme fragility of the most .beautiful
of human institutions—Love. Justiee Simpson’s frock
coat is worn a little longer (this refers to space
and not to time) than is now fashionable. His lavender
gloves (one worn, one carried) are comma ilfaut, and his
way of doing it gives the law on the question ; but his
habit of wearing his trousers rather short on the boots
mars an otherwise petfeet ensemble. In thematterof the
frock coat Justice Cohen is just right—not too shoit,
not too long-, like a well-considered judgment.
Both Soloms create an absorbing interest on
the part of the fair sex when they promenade
the block. The Chief Justice is still a “fine
fig-ure of a man,” wears his clothes well, and walks with a
jaunty, springy step which shows the youthfulness of his
76 years. All three are outdoor men ; the Chief walks,
Justice Gohen swims, and Justice Simpson saunters agood
deal in a graceful manner which belonged to a pictu-
resque past generation, and is now—except among the
select few—a lost art. We are too darned strenuous to-
day, and the speed disease is attacking the Courts.
ROW PUBLIC OPINION IS MANU-
FACTURED.
Drapery establishments are getting assistants to sign a
petition protesting- against Wages Board being it.fc o[?]ed
into S.A. drapery trade.
FAT EMPLOYER : “Now, ’ere you are! Sign it
or quit .”
The other day, in Brisbane, two prisoners
were to be tried together, and barrister Lukin
appeared for one of them, and Power for the
other. Now, Lukin started to wear horsehair
about four months before Power, and they wasted
time trying to settle whether he should be first
fiddle on that account, or whether Power should
have first say, because his client’s name came
before that of Lukin’s on the record. Power
wanted to cross-examine witnesses first, and
Lukin wanted to address the jury last. Lukin
didn’t like the first part of this, for that would
make him Power’s junior for the time being, and
such a thing would be a dreadful blow to the
dignity of his horsehair ; so before going on with
the case he asked the opinion of the learned
Judge upon the weighty matter. Fortunately,
they grow some very sensible Judges up North,
as well as a few very pernickettv ones; so this
Judge poured oil upon the troubled inane, and
said that he thought either of them could bray
second without permanently affecting the curl of
his horse-combings.
THE GREAT SOLUTIONIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Walla Hall was crowded with electors on Friday
night on the occasion ot Mr. R. T. Ball's address to the
electors. There was a cood attendance of ladies. Mr.
Ball gav2 a clear and lucid account of the Land
Scandals, thoroughly explaining the action taken by the
Government to enforce the return of Mr. Willis from,
South Africa, and also of the legal proceedings against
Messrs. Crick and Willis. —Border Mail.
He grapples grimly with the stern,
Unyielding problem of the day—
His brethren have a lot to learn
And he will teach them straight away—
Dark problems that most men appal
Offer no difficulty at all
To Mister Ball !
His clear and lucid speech recounts
The pros and cons once lost in gloom,
He opens all the inner founts
Of Past Events and Coming Doom—
Yea, there, in distant Walla Hall,
He “ thoroughly explains it all”
Does Mister Ball 1
The silence grows ; it grows intense
The while he speaks so bold and clear ;
If anyone dropped eighteenpence
The sound would strike the straining ear.
Kind Heaven be thanked for that sweet drawl 1
He knows—7te knows—a e knows it all-
Does Mr. Ball.
“He clearly shows ”; “he briefly states ” ;
“ He shrewdly hints” ; “ he boldly claims” ;
“ He disagrees ” ; “ he deprecates ” ;
“ He calls things by their proper names ” ;
In language eloquent and tall
He talks like David unto Saul,
Does Mister Ball.
H ■ “ lets the light in ” on this point -
He “ understands that this was meant ”
He w fears the times are out of joint ”
“ The country ought to he content
“ It really was a party brawl ”
He “ hopes he'll never have to crawl ”
D >es Mister Bawl.

FACILE PRINCEPS SEMPER IDEM
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 17, 1907.
My Dear Arini,—
Lady Northcote opened the Women’s Work
Ex. with a few words and many smiles,
and took the illuminated address offered her
by Miss Rawson with an air of having
achieved one of her life’s aims. Her long
sapphire velvet coat caught a slanting sunray,
and the aureate glow on the jewel color of the
velvet was comforting to the soul. In sooth there
was no more room on the platform for aught but a
ray of light. The executive committee, the Darlevs,
the choir of 80 voices, the Admiral, his Lady-
o’-war, three Rawsons—young Wyatt is cultiva-
ting a topaz-hued moustache—and some of the
mighty atoms that make up the staffs of
“Cranbrook” and Admiralty House—these
and a group of invited strangers, the Henniker
Heatons and Miss Amy Sherwin included,
were butted and pushed by a crowd that surged
up on two «ides, and asked the large, resisting
policeman if his grandmother’s daughter knew of
his being at large. The day was a grocers’ holiday,
or some such, and the women and girls who
didn t go to Clifton Gardens for buns and billy tea
came to the Ex. opening. The gate money was
but a shilling, and they had as much right there
as any. The damsel who ate chocolates close to
Miss Margaret Harris’ ear, and then wiped her
hands on the long tails of another platform person’s
tailor-coat, should have selected another day—or
another woman’s coat.
In the Inventions section is a combination
baby’s bath and cot, by Miss M‘Leod, matron of
the Crown-street Women’s Hospital. It is only
one of many useful arrangements in the medical
and nursery line designed by that lady. A screen
(invented by Miss Fell) to keep light from a
patient’s eyes is a clever, simple device. It is an
adjustable shade on an upright bar that locks on
to the frame of the bed. Simple as it is, the
lady has been thinking it out for years. Its germ
was a straw fan tied to a walking-stick.
But the one masculine-looking exhibit amongst a
wilderness of femininities is the Steel Wings
Windmill—the only really double-balanced wind-
mill in existence. The crowds that passed the
soaring piece of mechanism took it for something
left over from the last Bucolic Show. But crowds
don’t think—they only tramp and swarm, and
stare and breathe heavily. The windmill is the
invention of Mrs. C. J. McMaster, of North
Queensland, and has a pathetic interest, for its
originator died just as it was patented. “It
pumps from river, mill or dam,” says its “book of
words.” One may imagine its inventress living in
North Queensland and thinking long and hard in
droughty times on how to raise the water—
not the wind. Life there for women isn’t all ripe
paw-paw and pineapple.
In the Arts and Crafts section is a good panel
with carved iris. Even in a plastic material the
iris is a difficult flower to reproduce, yet in such
an intractable medium as wood the cunning
artist has made it seem to bloom. Wbod-carving,
chairs with decorative designs on stamped leather’
friezes, curtains and drapings stencilled in Aus-
tralian floral patterns—these exhibits vie with the
marvellous lace and other needlework in point of
interest.
Surprisingly meagre is the show of frocks, hats
and general frill. There is one tailor-built gown—
a coat and skirt in blue serge. It is apparently
perfect, and Elsa Foster, whoever she may be,
has in it accomplished one of the most difficult
tests of dress making.
t)ne of the luncheon rooms supplied the very
few bits of humor going. In the morning the
A.B.C. girls bore the heat and burden of the ham
and tongue sandwich and the pot of tea. In the
afternoon Somebody girls, under the generalship
of Miss Eadith Walker, took up the other white
girls’ burden. One of the Dangar damsels got a
fcip of threepence from an affable male customer.
She accepted it courteously. Another amateur
was threatened by an angry customer, “ I’ll report
you to the manager of the A.8.C.”
The weeding-out process is now going on at the
Exhibition. The painters of most of the pictures
deserve three weeks without the option. Miss
Rod way, Miss Ethel Stephens, Miss Cusack
Miss Roberts, Miss Muskett, Miss Eirene Mort’
and Miss Gether stand out as successful in the art
section.
Mrs. Ted Simpson and her eldest daughter will
go off for a six months’ trip presently. The Simp-
son mansion has been taken by the John Simpsons
he being an uncle of the Ted gentleman. One of the
most decorative pieces of tapestry work at the
Women’s Exhibition is a screen worked by Miss
Vera Simpson.
A member of the Archiepiscopal Smithereens has
an oil dog in the Exhibition. That is, it is a
painted dog done in oils, and well done too
You’d know it was a dog at the first glance
Papa Saumarez Smith beamed at it as he passed
the picture, and looked cautiously at his calves to
see that they were not bitten. On the platform
at the opening of the Ex. the S.-S.’s were
numerous. Curate S.-S.’s bride has one of those
rare faces that grow prettier the more closely they
are inspected. No doubt that’s what the gentle
curate thought of. If she’d only condescend to
fluff her hair over an obviously intellectual fore-
head, she might enter for the beauty contest
amongst the Smart Setters of Sydney.
The hunt for the Model Kitchen exhibit at the
Women’s Work Show gave hundreds of women a
lot of healthy exercise. They pursued the
phantom prize as did the knights'the Holy Grail
And to this minute not a dozen of them know
that the O.K. Kitchen was merely a plan on paper.
One gets back to the Ex. like a properly hurled
boomerang to its thrower. For' months it has
filled the eye, ear, and time of Sydney women.
Gate proceeds have mounted to four figures. It
is a great financial success and a good indus-
trial and artistic achievement. On Saturday
the driving competition brought out a group
of smart vehicles, horses and drivers. Mrs.
Forsyth, of Newcastle, a well-known horsey
lady, was the best and most graceful driver.
Miss Eadith Walker’s horse, Bushman, trotted
as gracefully as a cat, lifting his forelegs
high and with a fearful amount of frill, as if
to do the shake-hands that was fashionable some
years ago. Miss Russell French drove the winning
turnout—young Mrs. Rawson’s. Miss Bertha
Brady was up behind a pretty piece of meat. So
were two Holdship youngsters. Their pony
looked like a rocking-horse—only he was a goer.
The Exhibition closes to-morrow (Wednesday).
Mrs. Blanche Arral, in a peach of a travelling
frock, a distractingly tilted hat, and turquoise
buttons in her ears, has left here for Newcastle,
where she will open on Monday next (the 23rd).
“ I seeng de Eenglis songee now—O, tres bien !
Mais oui, ‘ Sing, Zweet Birt,’ eh ! In a month I
comeback. Au revoir.” With the French star
go her pianist, Proctor, and the harpist, Torzillo.
Newcastle and the North have feasts of melody
in store.
A private letter from London says that Carrie
Moore will come here next year to play in “ The
Merry Widow” comic opera, of which Mr. Wil-
liamson has acquired the Australian rights.
Remember that round girl who played the bov in
“The Sign of the Cross,” and married a Mel-
bournian—George Washington Smith ? She’s
coming here with the Thornton co.
Miss Clara Manning, with some friends, left for
Japan last week. When she returns her engage-
ment will be announced.
A Sydney pretty is carrying a purse these days
that makes the tram conductor get muddled over
the change. It is an alligator’s claw. The busi-
ness-like murder-and-sudden-death claws are all
there, but the wrist bones, so to speak, have been
removed, and the interior is the coin receptacle.
The glorified reptile to which the claw belonged
was shot by the girl’s brother in Mexico.
Doesn’t a man who allows his horse to wear a
bangle on its tail deserve to be captured—by in-
furiated bull ants? Raid Sir Harry Maclean,
who was lately run in by some Moorish person
named Raisuli, used to ride abroad in great style.
The tail of his horse was dyed a bright pink, and
was confined midway within a small necklace or
big wedding ring. Probably he was looking back-
ward in terror lest the horse had lost its tail-
bracelet when Raisuli rushed him. Morocco is a
troubled, anxious, worried country in which a
general has to keep his eye on the enemy, and,
round by Fez and the Atlas range he w'ho hesi-
tates over his steed’s hinder jewellery is lost.
Miss Gertrude Wilshire, the good-looking
daughter of the good-looking widow who
administers Cromer flats, was due to be mar-
ried yesterday to Mr. Channing-Buckland,
of Auckland (M.L.). Miss Wilshire is six solid!
feet of upstanding girl, and one of the most
capable nurses Sydney hospital has turned out.
She is a grand-daughter of a former Auckland!
resident —Hague Smith; and the Wilshires
are descendants of old John Robertson, who used
in his haste to speak lurid language through his
nose.
Nuns voted full strength at the recent elections.
At Bathurst 200 of them arrived in closed car-
riages. and put each her cross opposite the name of
the blessed candidate of her choice. He was
blessed to have such a vote. It must have been
of the block variety. At Waverley Mrs. Monty
Severn, who toiled like the hurried and!
burdened ant for Major Onslow', found that the-
work has its drawbacks. For instance, she
encountered a husband and wife, and, with guile-
ful, honeyed w'ords, sought their votes at great
length. It was only after some precious time had
gone to join the years w'hich the locust had for
breakfast that she found they had none. Both
were under age. By way of compensation, the
fair vote-bagger caught a lady of 85, and ran her
into a booth to do her duty as an elector.
Another brave lady battler tells of how she did
Miller’s Point trying to get the women to vote
“no license.” A voteress scorned the request.
“That would be making things too easy for the
publicans,” she said. “ I’ll vote for a reduction
of licenses, for I do think they pay too much for
their licenses.”
Mrs. Monty Severn’s petition against the tariff
mustered 3500 names. It was sent to the book-
binders to have its hair brushed and its tail
curled, and then Bruce Smith led it to Parlia-
ment, whither it W'ent with its ears back and
“propping vigorously.” I could get more signa-
tures than that to a petition against the dog-tax.
A note from Miss Bess Norris, the miniaturist,
tells that she and future bridegroom Tait will
divide their time between London and Australia.
By the steamer Kempsey. on Saturday, the-
Vinia de Loitte and Howard Vernon wedded pair
went to the town of the same name, where a land
boQm is raging. Three dogs accompanied the
tuneful pair.
Conductor Slapoffski, of the eagle eye and nose
and the vagrant lock of hair, has won the coveted
post of conductor to the Amateur Orchestral
Society. He need not be here till the beginning
of next w'inter, as the Society only gives four con-
certs per annum.
Miss Amy Mack, who has been seoretarying the
Queen’s Jubilee Fund for some years, has resigned
the billet on account of her forthcoming marriage.
The committee gave her a gvwd-bye jewel.
Miss Garran returns to the Fund w'ork, and is
again secretary.
Thus “Mario,” from Brisbane :
Following humbly in the footsteps of the Southern
States, Queensland has now' come along with its little
Exhibition of Women’s Work. The show is spread in a
large three-storey barn off George-street. The barn used
to be a part of the Lands Offices. A band plays during
the evenings, and al fresco concerts supply a lot of
girlies with chances to lift up their voices to the utmost
limit in the presence of a throng that doesn’t seem so>
disturbed as might be expected.
The Show is like the bashful curate’s egg—parts of it
are excellent, but, save for some very small exceptions
(like the miniature by Miss B. Gibson, which the frail,
pale Governor bought instanter), the fine arts do not
belong to the parts of the egg that were acceptable to
the curate. There is one specimen entitled “Dreaming,”
which suggests asunner of onions and tripe. “ Bits” of’
Brisbane abound, and it is to be hoped that they will not
be sent South to further prejudice you against our city.
Mrs. O. Foote has the best animal study (an Irish terrier),
and Miss L. Gibson has the best portrait. Also Mesdames
Aird and Eggar supply genuine bits of art, and there are
firescreens. Miss Lucy Dickson divides the best bit of
stitchery with Miss Shaw. Not the least interesting
of the non-competitive exhibits are the volumes of “ The
Scarlet Pimpernel” in Braille writing.
The decorum of the Ladies’ gallery at the House was
much disturbed, the other night, by an enraged lady, who
ordered an atttractive damsel out of her sight, on the
ground that she was a brazen person, not nice to rub
elbows on. There were tears and lamentations on the
part of the attractive one, while number one wended her
way to the room of a certain legislator, and gave him the
bulk of her mind in forcible language. Next day the
Speaker was called in to arbitrate upon the fitness or
otherwise of the lady to sit among the mighty, but this
“me brither Jan ” firmly and wisely refused to do. There
are unexpected reserves of sagacity about “ me brither
Jan.” The personality'of the ladies is still unknown to
all but a few, but if matters recur the attention of the
Attorney-General is to be called to the trouble, and the
grievance is to be investigated. It could come under the
Poor Prisoners’ Defence Act.
The Brisbane Liedertafel concert arrived on Wednes-
day in the Exhibition Hall. It blared under vice-regal
patronage, and the music was, on the whole, good. In
the matter of the assisting soprano, however, the society’
might have done better, judging by results, if it had given
someone nearer home a chance.
The bride-elect of the Nelson-Bird combine is under-
going a round of farewell teas, at which hankies, d’oyleys
and the like are showered in. Pretty Violet Okeden is in
a like state what time she can spare from being “tried
on.” There’s no doubt that. Charles De Burgh Perssehas
real Irish luck in gaining such a bonnie bride.
Peacefully there passed away on Friday, at the age of
82, Mrs. Ilassall, widow of one of Queensland’s oldest
clergymen, the Rev. J. S. Hassall. The deceased lady
leaves six children, something like 30 grandchildren, and

The Girl with a Tale.
The civilised community will have to face
seriously, one day, the problem of the girl with a
nasty tale. She is one of the by-products of
civilisation —that civilisation which takes woman
out of her old quiet sphere, and allows her to share
man’s knowledge of life, without, as yet, sharing
man’s view of life. As a dangerous and un-
pleasant by-product, she calls for some special
treatment. Hardly a day passes but in some
court or police-station there appears a girl or a
woman with a nasty tale, facing a man who is put
in peril of his life and liberty by her morbid
imagination and shameless falsehood. Very often
the girl with a tale is exposed in her lies owing to
the mad recklessness with which she piles on the
agony. But there have been cases where it has
been shown that the innocent have suffered
grievously at her hands, and doubtless in very
many other cases the same thing has happened,
but no subsequent exposure has brought the truth
to light; in still other cases the threat of an
accusation has been smothered by the payment
of blackmail. The evil is widespread enough to
call for special legislation. And this not only
because of the direct evil, but also because of the
incidental injuries to decent women involved.
At present in N. S. Wales, for instance, “ the age
•of consent” is 14. No decent civilised man will
dare to argue that it is a right thing that an
innocent girl of 14 should be at the mercy of any
man who is wicked enough to try to seduce
her. But reform is blocked again and again
because of the fear that to raise the age limit will
be to add to the number of the victims of the nasty
tale by giving little slie-monsters power of life and
death to enforce their blackmail. Probably, too,
decent men would favor a law making the
seduction and subsequent abandonment of
any decent young woman a penal offence—
certainly it is against public policy as well as
against justice that a man should be able
without punishment to entrap a woman into
forfeiting most of her chances of a happy
life to gratify a selfish appetite. But again
the hussy with the nasty tale stands in
the way. To attempt to legislate against seduc-
tion with her in the background is practically
impossible ; it would extend too vastly the scope
of her malevolence. With reasonable legislative
precaution against the nasty tale it ought to be
possible to raise “the age of consent ” to a level
more consistent with decency, and also to act,
with some effectiveness, against the ruffian who
persuades an innocent woman into motherhood
and then abandons her. An indeterminate
sentence —imprisonment for a long enough time
to cure the mental weakness or wickedness
responsible—would be a quite reasonable punish-
ment for the infamous little she-scoundrel who is
found guilty of bringing a false sex-charge against
a man. The prospect of that penalty would
deter most imaginations from wandering loose-
just as the prospect of being unsympathetically
soused with w;iter will nip in the bud most
feminine hysterics.
Maortlano’s Council of Defence presented its
first report to Parliament recently, and startled
Ward’s own country out of its smug complacency
for about five minutes. The Council indulged in
a straight statement of facts, thereby differing
from the imported commandants who never for-
get that they are affable officers and gentlemen
first of all, and defenders of the Dominion last.
The Council told its bosses that the present
volunteer system is rotten, that it w'ould give the
:said system 12 months to recover its character,
and that if it failed Parliament would have to
pass an Act providing for compulsory and uni-
versal military training. What the Council will
do if Parliament declines to move, the Council
didn’t state, but presumably it will abolish the
totalisator, or declare the Parliamentary buildings,
a place within the meaning of the Act. Maori-
landers who have hitherto regarded the volun-
teers as weird persons possessed of a mental kink,
are now working strenuously to keep the totter-
ing system on the legs that are gone at the knees.
The thought of doubling round a drill-shed
•carrying a rifle does not rouse enthusiasm in the
stomach of Fat, who declares that such violent
exercise would drive Capital out of the country.
The Council also remarked that ammunition and
arms factories should be started, but as the coun-
cillors had used most of their ideas in shocking
Fat it was a tired remark, and was hardly noticed.

Australia can’t make a chair or a boot-last
(vide the remarks of any importer raging against
the tariff); yet the success of Relph’s flying
motor-boat Invincible has rushed Mort s Dock
Co. with orders for no less than twelve other
Invincible engines.
Ip everything was taken into account, it would be
found that Australia has paid dearly for every
ounce of cheap labor it has imported. If Statist
Knibbs could tell us what leprosy alone has cost
Australia, much of the glamor of the economical
nigger would vanish. A Cairns (Q.) paper notes
that in last July alone no fewer than 30 leprous
aliens were taken past there to the Moreton Bay
lazarette ; nine others followed a week later; and
two extras were collected on the way down.
And these are only some crude first-fruits. Into
how many white families has the contagion of
leprosy penetrated, to break out later on, at
intervals for generations to come? Cheap
labor, with not only the risk, but certainty,
of race pollution, disease, and degradation, is
surely the gospel of the maddest or meanest sort
of cannibal.
Mr. A. E. Webb, an engineer who has spent a
generation in the Ear North, chiefly in the
Japanese and Siamese Government services, was
in Sydney lately, and told how the Monkey’s
paw is relentlessly reaching out—out :
The Japanese are colonising Java. They are driving
the British out of the China Seas ; they are trying to get
a firm footing in British Columbia, and their ambition, as
every student of Asiatic affairs knows, is to be paramount
in the Pacific—paramount at the expense of ally, friend
or foe. The Sultan of Banka (one of the Java Islands)has
been to Japan to interview the Mikado. Why ? It is
common property ; everyone knows. It was an impudent
thing to do, but he attempted to get the Mikado to grant
him protection against the Dutch. I was in Java for two-
atid-a-half years. All the Dutch steamers running from
Hongkong take Japs to Java. Jabdinb’s boats
are doing the same. Also, there is a line of Chinese
steamers running between Samarang and Hongkong.
Besides, the E. and A. Co. brings Japs to Timor, in the
Malays, ostensibly for the pearling luggers. They never
return from those luggers. They drift along the Java
islands. The Dutch authorities have been very much
troubled about this matter for some time—ever since the
war. In Singapore the Japanese are already permanent.
They are gradually drifting towards Australia. In
Hongkong to-day you will see the Japanese motorboats
careering round the harbor. In the Pacific the Jap
marine is driving the British out. The Scottish Oriental
line has gone into the hands of the Germans —the Nord-
Deutscher Lloyd. William Milbdrn and Co. no longer
exist in the East. The Gulf Steamship Co. has gone out
of the trade ; so has the Abbotsford Co. Then Bowser
and Co. have disappeared. In short, 200 British
steamers have been wiped out of the Eastern
trade during the past few years. To-day, the
Japs are building steamers for Siam, both gunboats
and torpedo-boat destroj’ers. They are tr3'ing to get in
there, too. Some 300 or 400 .years ago there was a Jap
colony in Bangkok, Siam. They are trying to build it up
again, and to exclude the British and German officers
from the Siamese service. As a matter of fact, the ten-
dency in the Siamese service is to supplant the German
and British officers by appointing Japs. Of course there
are points of resemblance in the Jap and Siamese
language. Besides, some Japs are Buddhists ; so are the
Siamese. Many Punjabis have told me—and thers is no
reason to discredit their story—that Jap emissaries,
dressed as Buddhist monks, are in India. They are
trying to instil in the Hindu mind that Japan is the
coming Power. It is the intention of the Japs, no matter
what Count Hayasiii says, to secure supremacy in the
East at all costs. This interests Australia—Java is three-
days sail from Port Darwin ; Timor is 24 hours.”

The magnificent incapacity of the average
country alderman has had another fine advertise-
ment up on the prosperous N.S. W. North Coast.
Eive years ago, Murwillumbah formed itself into
a municipality, and provided itself with an outfit
of mayor and aldermen; but, though the town
consisted almost wholly of wooden buildings, and
though it knew all along that it was in constant
peril of being swept right out of existence by fire,
its outfit of mayor and aldermen let year after
year slip by without organising a fire brigade, or
providing even the beginnings of a plant to stop a
blaze. The always-threatening blaze postponed
itself for five years ; then something went wrong
in a bakery, and 59 premises, including four banks,
were ashes and charcoal before the fire burned
itself out on Monday morning. All sorts of esti-
mates are made of the loss—from £70,000 to
£150,000; but it is likely to be nearer the bottom
figure than the top. In Switzerland they do
things better than that. In some cantons, at
least, fire insurance is a Government monopoly,
and is compulsory ; and the Government takes all
sorts of care under those circumstances that fires
don’t rage if it can stop them.
A Retl Nose is the bane of many a woman’s exist-
ence. It detracts so greatly from her appearance that all
sorts of subterfuges are resorted to to hide the defect. But
ladies should know that an absolutely certain and pain-
less cure can be had at the Valaze Institute. Here Dr.
Lassar’s Electric Device, operating a process of Nasal
Massage, restores a Bed Nose to its normal color in from
six to eight sittings. Mile. Helena Bubinstein secured
this treatment from Vienna, where it is used in the
Beauty Salons for which that city is famed. Of course,
one must personally attend the Institute to be treated,
hut those who have to deiay their visit may secure a
Cream and Powder from 8/- that hides the defect.
Then, when opportunity offers, they can call and need
have no further trouble with the disfigurement. Call
or write either to the Valaze Institute, 274 Collins
Street, Melbourne, or 158 Pitt Street, Sydney.*
The master tailors of Sydney held a meet-
ing lately to bray seriously against the tariff.
They invited all the importers—in fact, they
invited everybody interested except one. Vicars,
the Marrickville manufacturer. Having thus
made sure that there was no one present to expose
any of their wild misstatements, they devoted
themselves to telling each other how impossible it
was for Australians to make decent clothing
material. One ninth-part of a man spoke most
seriously on the alleged fact that Australian
makers were late in getting new British patterns.
This must be a shocking thing to the dude who
■can’t walk down the street in comfort unless he is
wearing the exact shade of giraffe sneeze pants
that are the pride of the moment in London, but
only a soul of the drapery order would agitate
itself over a fashion-plate item like that.
Most men who have mouths of taste and
refinement about them have partaken of the famous
O.T. Punch. Those who have not have missed a
good thing, and should remedy the omission
straight away. However, in order to make sure
•of extracting the largest possible amount of bliss
from the proceeding, make sure that it is J, Dixon
and Co.’s preparation, the real O.T. The Dixon
firm desires to draw particular attention to the
fact that a preparation selling as O’C Chili Punch
is not manufactured by it, and has no connection
with the O.T. article.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 16, 1907.
My Dear Yarrie.—
Letters are arriving from Lady Doughty for
girl chums in Melbourne with fuller accounts of
the cabled Doughty wedding. Mr. Williamson,
who was to have “ given the bride away,” was too
ill to perpetrate that act of reckless generosity,
and Colonel Outtrim (of Melbourne fame) handed
Miss Stone to the altar of sacrifice. The Spanish
church, in Manchester Square, was the back-
ground for the ceremony—instead of Brompton
Oratory. About 300 guests were present at a re-
ception at Hyde Park Hotel. Also there comes a
dazzling list of presents, headed by the diamonds
—collar, bracelet and ring—with which the bride-
groom fettered his bride to the marble halls of her
new existence.
Miss Irene Dillon writes from Auckland in
regard to a par. in this column stating that she
was engaged to Mr. Weedon, jnr., of Melbourne
(29/8/’07): “ 1 don’t know what grounds you have
for the statement, and should feel greatly obliged
if you will contradict it.” It is hereby con-
tradicted.
Melbourne maidens are going back to nice
grandmotherly ideas about stitchery. The
Women’s Exhibition —“Our Exhibition,” as the
Northcote Lady loves to call it —is responsible for
much of the revival. Talking of stitchery, the
Leslie Madden maiden is making her trousseau
“ ajl herself,” embroidering fine linen and putting
in miles of tucks. It is not the Exhibition
example that has spurred this dainty maiden to
these vast exertions ; she is urged thereto by the
upbringing of a very practical mamma.
Mrs. George Chirnside, Frenchy, fair, and per-
fectly dressed, is sweeping about in a glorified
haze with her lioness in tow. Melba is her guest,
and Melba’s marvellous motor is also staying at
the Chirnside town house. Mrs. George’s own
motor is shoved into some dusty crypt or back-
ground, and the big star newcomer is used on all
occasions. When it appears in Collins-street a
crowd collects, even if Melba isn’t on board.
Merely to smell the smell of the petrol in the
tank of the car which carries Melba when she
happens to be there is something. The big
nightingale is shy of appearing.
Melba is not a restful person, and even if she
were inclined to take it easy, as per expressed
intention, other people find her too useful as an
advertisement to permit of privacy. She has
promised—perhaps pie-crustily, but still she has
promised—to distribute the prizes won at the
Ballarat Eisteddfod in October. About half a
thousand mothers with singing daughters are
praying for Melba’s ad vice as to training and the
easiest road to a Career.
A charming adventuress, who figured pro-
minently in Australian sassiety, has come a horrid
cropper into the arms of the U.S.A. police
authorities. The things which tripped her are
sundry charges of fraud and larceny. When she
was at Menzies’ Hotel here she was the daughter
of a half-pay artillery colonel, with a travelling
commission from the London Times. In America
her papa had become the Earl of Ilchester, and
her literary notions rose to the dignity of a novel
or a play. The enterprising lady made a habit of
victimising hotels, and incidentally lawyers and
doctors. One story she told, which earned her
trade credit, was that she was the fiancee
of speculator Harvey Patterson, who, she repre-
sented, made her an ante-marital allowance
of £5OO a month. Furthermore, she instructed a
Montreal man-o’-law to sue that pillar of finance
for unlimited damages, on account of alleged
breach of promise. Instructions were mailed to a
local firm, which didn’t think that the lady’s case
was in its line. Since then some of her creditors
have had letters purporting to come from her in
Melbourne, and have tentatively attempted to
collect their accounts from anyone connected with
their debtor’s romances. The lady is really the
daughter of an English coastguard, and hits a
fairly-varied history. Considering that she was a
fine linguist, and possessed alniost encyclopsedic
knowledge, the gifted spinster might easily have
made a hit in some less exciting and more steady
profession than that of confidence-maid. But,
anyhow, the run she’s had for other people’s
money reads like a Gaboriau fiction.
All the Fenner clan rolled up to wave a flowery
farewell to Miss Marion Grey, the lady who is de-
parting to England with a fractured contract, and
shaking the angry dust off her No. 3 shoes at
Julius Knight, Elbert, Orton and co. Miss Grey
was really shockingly treated. It is a pity Austra-
lians had practically no chance of seeing her act,
for she has a big British reputation. The mum-
meress is wedded to Walter Fenner, cousin to the
important Australian clan. He intended coming
to Australia to pick up talented wife and have a
gay time in Melbourne, but that arrangement is
“ off.” There was a warm send-off on the blus-
terous deck of the Ormuz, where the wind, clad
in a shred of brief authority, did things with
people’s hats that should have made the angels
use strong language.
Clara Butt concert on Tuesday was a little dis-
appointing. It is a beautiful voice—round and
rich and warm—but there is a Want. Trying to
track that want to its residence I banged up
against the arrangement of the programme. On
the whole, it was inartistic —in a kind of par-
lance, “popular.” There was too much of the
bounding British “Rule Britannia” style of
shout, and a surplus of the cheap sentimental
song. Listening to “Divinities du Styx,” from
the opera “Alcestes,” one dreamt a programme
of other exquisite things that her richness of voice
could surround. One dreamt and didn’t get.
There was a cheated feeling as one thought of
the glories of melody that could float from that
great column of a throat, with a more subtle
selection of song. The great Clara shows the
same remarkable poise and lightness in her voice,
in proportion to its size, as she does in her big,
graceful avoirdupois.
The Butt bow is a wonderful thing; a big
graceful swing. She evidently learnt the art of
“touching your toes without bending the knees ”
in her school days. Husband Kennerley follows
suit with a good copy. The Babies did not appear
at the concert, but Mamma Clara rang in an encore
song about “ ten little toes and a nose,” and other
things that well-regulated babies own.
Both the Rumfords had been doing battle with
influenza for some days before the concert. They
were too limp to venture out from their entrench-
ments to a little dinner—specially in their honor
—at the Chief Judicial Maddens’ on the Sunday
before.
Clara Butt revels in frocks. She has made
many appearances, but never twice in the same
toggery. A swishy, swirly, lustrous white silk
was Tuesday’s gown, spread with a fortune in
rose point, and tied up under the arms with blue
ribbon. A huge pink rose looked like a bud
on her mighty chest. The big lady’s jewels
are wonderful things, and she wears them with
taste and in turn. There is never a splash and
dazzle. Her earrings are joyous jewels. I have
seen her wear single pearls—the size of a daisy—
studded in her well-shaped ears, and anon
diamonds that drop in a cascade to her shoulders.
The Butt babies, with Nursie and Auntie, are
regally installed at “St. Leonards,” St. Kilda,
and are getting in good work with buckets and
spades on the remnant of beach left untouched by
Dreamland, Pierrots, and other invaders. The
Buttiest baby is a coming singer. His boom can
be heard as far as a fog-horn. It’s a fine cross
between popper and mommer’s warble. He is
an assertive youngster with coal black eyes and a
storm of fair hair.
The “Butt hat” ravages Melbourne like a flat
epidemic. The divine Clara flattens out her
glossy hair and flattens out her flower-garden hats
to bring her colossal self to the level of Kennerley,
and the adoring Melbourne girl follows suit,
regardless of her inches, with extraordinary effect.
The stupendous Butt’s second concert was per-
formed to a full house studded with more or less
notable folk. The contralto wasn’t in her best
voice, and her selections were of that lachrymose
order that makes even the gentlest spinster
wonder what drink would exhilarate her.
Mr. Butt, however, relieved the melodious
gloom with a martial rendering of the “ Two
Grenadiers” and some ditties that are allegedly of
Irish origin. He’s really a beautiful young man.
The columnal Clara was bound in sweeping green
satin draperies, punctuated with a scarlet rose,
and an assortment of diamonds. On the platform
one may observe the flatness of her heels, and the
height of Mr. Butt’s elevators. In the audience
were Janet Mrs. and a party, Mrs. John Forrest,
in a chic arrangement of coffee-tinted lace, and an
nstalment of the Madden family.
The latest footlighter to turn to the “d. f.
villa, charmingly furnished, piano, silver,
moderate ! ” beloved of wily house agents, is Miss
Clara Clifton. That genial soul, what time she
isn’t impersonating ladies of various qualities, is
enthusiastically playing house-wife in a nest at
Albert Park. Nowadays the imported busker
frequently shows an amiable leaning towards
domesticity, and modestly avoids the unblinking
observation of public tables-d'hdle. It’s only the
newly-married couple, or the shortly-to-be-
divorced one, which seeks refuge in high-tariffed
temples dedicated to scandals, slanders, and
sybarites.
Witty Mrs. A. M. Wielie, who is responsible
for certain volumes, past, present a,nd future, is
exercising her originality in a new direction. She
now applies her inventive faculties and a clever
brush to the creation of friezes, dadoes, decorative
doors—everything, in fact, that is calculated to
send the misery of mere kalsomined walls and
bald board-doors into dire disrepute. One of her
recent commissions is the adornment of the
children’s ward at the Homoeopathic Hospital.
Enchanted princesses and beautiful boy-lovers
riot in rose gardens, and Noah’s live stock prance
in prim pairs, looking fit for exhibition at any
ideal agricultural show, and happy hours and
golden hair seem the heritage of all the frescoed
fairies.
The damsels who constitute the Women’s
Brass Band, for the Women’s Exhibition, are re-
hearsing with great solemnity and vigor. The
obvious pleasure of the lady who blows into the
biggest brass, when she induces a hollow roar like
unto that voiced by Bashan’s bull when he ran
amok into Gilead, is a delight to behold. The
coquetry of the maid whose oboe simpers out a
phrase or two is truly captivating. The virile
caperings of the conductress, as with flashing eye
and tense arms she goads her flock to further,
louder efforts, are most enlivening. And their
music ! Well, that is at least instructive. Later
on it may be endurable.
The Wimmen’s League adds to its list of mis-
demeanors a newspaper enterprise. A monthly
journal entitled The Oat— no, I mean The
Woman— will make its curtsey this month. The
paper is edited by a B. A. with a spike or hyphen
in her name, and is to have “ contributions from
distinguished people” who usually, alas, write in
such an undistinguished way. Dowager Clarke
and some other political matrons lend the editress
aid in refusing copy from people who are not
strictly dull and classy.
An interesting communication has reached me
which I can’t do better than repeat verbatim. It
concerns, as will be seen, a family that plays its
part bravely in Vanity Fair. It arrived under an
ornate engraved heading, and said :
Miss Rachel Isaacs-Aarons (or something like it) cele-
brated her fifth birthday at her parents’ residence on
Saturday last. A marquee was erected on the lawn,
where refreshments were served out. A Punch and Judy
show, merry-go-round, phonograph and swings were
much indulged in by the young folk. A conspicuous
part of the children’s enjoyment was a small Timor pony,
10 hands high, which the juveniles had many rides on.
At midnight the children dispersed to their homes after
a good day’s enjoyment.
For particularity of detail and ebullience of
humor, no professional journaliar could eclipse
this illuminating account of the youthful high
life. So I don’t attempt to paraphrase it. I
merely picture young Donald Moses going home
in the small hours filled with buns.
Painter John Ford Paterson opened his canvas
show on Tuesday at the Guildhall, and will
receive visitations from connoisseurs and mere lay-
folk until the 21st September. The exhibition is
unusually interesting in its variety. There is an
unsensational bush-fire, sombre and lurid ; a fowl-
yard, where laying hens disport themselves (he
painted them on a real live chicken run); and a
score of sketches that are like couplets from a
poem. His big canvases are principally
seascapes—a new departure for him. The
night-piece is inspired. Of all pictures lately
seen, none has so captured that eerie
witch who carries evening gloom into the
Australian bush, and prisoned her in pigment.
It is full of that still, clear darkness out of which
dreams, and desires are spun. “Among the
Reeds” and “Black Swans” are two other pic-
tures which are low-toned melodies of color. The
seascapes—mostly scenes round Kilcunda—are
more joyously decorative. They show that
clarity of light, and s harpness of outline, which
make our coast-line so characteristic.
Dr. Billy Maloney, M.H.R., is disposing of
most of his freehold property, on a basis that
arouses—-at least to my non-auditing mind—admi-
ration. The worker who wants a four-roomed
house in good order, within walking distance of
town, can buy one from the “ little doctor ” for
£lO down and 10s. a iveek for 10 years—which
amounts to £270. There are neither fines nor
forfeitures; the purchaser may sell at any time,
and if any just cause prevents full payments being
made, half will be accepted until a house-father’s
sickness, or any other misfortune, has been over-
come and remedied. Also, an arrangement may
be made with a life insurance office, and by a
small increase of weekly payments the pur-
chaser’s life can be insured so that the property
may come to his family, free of charge, in the
event of his dying before 10 years have elapsed.
Miss Heinze, the tempestuous enchantress of
the Musgrove combination, has bought the furni-
ture of a Melbourne mansion dweller, and leased
a flat. Evidently she intends to stir things up in
this town.
“Raffles,” at the Princess’s, drew quite a
lively first-night crowd. The Maddens dashed
up, in full vice-regal style, and filled a box,
the father of the clan beaming in the centre,
and his blooming girleens surrounding him.
Melba and her hostess, the Chirnside madam,
favored the Clara Butt warble. Dorothy Vane
Menzies boxed with a man or two, and Mr. and
Mrs. Tallis, with nephew Nicholson and a party—
held vantage point above. Saw big Greder, the
stage manager of the poor storm-tossed German
Opera Co. He sat in the stalls, but wandered
round in intervals.
“ Rosna ” sends news from Adelaide :
An agricultural show has been obliterating this land-
scape, and all of it that didn’t get obliterated was blocked
for a week by weird millinery apparitions and the latest
fashions from Oodnadatta and Hergott Springs—likewise
the Paris hat from the County of Robinson. A number
of shops burst into an epidemic of bargain sales. One
shop offered a silk dress to the she who succeeded in
trampling the human sisterhood under foot and making
the first purchase of the morning. Another set out lines
at 3d., and the town was full of enthusiastic and eco-
nomical marms lurching along under the weight of
naked carpet brooms, cruets, washstands, and other
threepenny bric-a-brac. Sassiety was very “ bawed ”at
all this unkempt frenzy, and frankly disparaged the
gushing daughters of Nature who came from communing
with the vast distances, and the dingo, and the glory of
the everlasting stars. It came one day and gazed at the
Show through its haughty glasses. Then it ran back to
its exclusive links, and “ goffed ” coldly until the hayseed
herd should cease to obstruct the atmosphere.
Talking of “ goffing,” Mrs. J. R. Anderson, the hon.
sec. of the Women’s Work Exhibition, has rushed away to
“goff”at Sandringham for the tournament, as a relaxa-
tion after her labors. Mrs. Gordon Ayers and Miss
Kathleen Gordon are stalking the giddy “ goff ” ball with
her.
Some enterprising people, determined to strike while
the Show was hot, organised a street collection for the
Home for Incurables, and nice girls stood on the street
corners to lure the penny and the sovereign from the
pockets of unsuspecting mankind and protesting woman-
kind. They lured to the extent of £450, to which will be
added £3O from the sale of a bullock given by Mr. R. T.
Melro-e, and the proceeds of the Show guessing com-
petition. The bullock doubtless consoled himself with
the knowledge that he fell down dead in a good cause.
Professor Henderson, who wears a torchlight procession
of decorations behind his name, is discoursing weekly to
the Intellect of the State on W. Wordsworth, R. Brown-
ing, and A. Tennyson. He does it in an interesting
fashion, but I wish he would lecture on Josh Billings.
In the “ Blue Moon Lady Madcap ” co., and also in
the Brescians co., now raging in Adelaide, we can boast a
local performer. In the former, Harold Parks, a romantic
young man who lately committed matrimony after a five
days’ engagement, is gathering green and numerous
laurels. At the latter, tehor Maurice Chenoweth, whose
longhair once decorated our little Conservatorium, is
raising his fine voice amid the appreciation of the multi-
tude.
The latest engagement of interest is that of Mrs.
Charlie Chappie, just returned from Britain, to Colonel
Kingsley Paget, of Rangoon, Burmah. The lady has
been holiday jaunting in Edward Vll.’s isle for a year,
and returned just for a lingering farewell. Whether the
Colonel will be able to tear himself away from Burmah,
or whether the mountain will have to go to Mahommed,
does not transpire. (The “ Mountain ”is merely a figure
of speech. The bride-elect is tall and slender, and more
like a goddess than a mountain. Yet it is some years
since the public knew her professionally as Miss Nellie
Harley.)
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
W. H. Irvine announces himself in the
Tariff debate as an advocate of effective Protec-
tion. When he opened his campaign in the
Wimmera in 1901 this same Iceberg announced
himself a Freetrader. Some 20 years before that
he wrote an article over his name in Mortimer
Franklyn’s old Victorian Review, in which he
argued that Protection is an absolutely essential
policy for young countries. Which is really the
inside of Irvine’s coat, and which is the exterior?
Victorian Railway Commissioner Tait got
back just in time to hear Thomas Bent remark in
the distance :
If Mr. Kernot, the Chief Engineer of Railway Construc-
tion, would condescend to bend his energies in the direc-
tion of limiting the weight of rolling stock, he (Bent)
would feel obliged ; and he need not mind the Commis-
sioners, as the Government would have to straighten
them up.
But,, alas! the massive Premier, though he has
promised to “ straighten up ” lots of things and
persons at lots of times—the Western District
squatters, for instance —has never yet managed to
quite straighten himself. He is still Bent.
Bill Young’s defeat at Bathurst was a
startling event, the betting on him locally being
from 2 to 3to 1. William suffered from the fact
that he belonged to no particular party; also his
fiscal faith has been undiscoverable these years
past; and—though allegedly a labor sympathiser-
wild battle-axes couldn’t urge him on to a Federal
Labor man’s platform. Bill Young’s trouble is,
in fact, and always has been, that he is a Bill
Youngite pure and simple. Bathurst is a safe
Labor seat, as the late Federal election showed,
and in any future contest may be won by a Labor
man—but he must be the real article.
“ Ob.” writes :
It was time VVestralia got the new tariff. Not many
years ago there were several foundries almost within
sight of the Boulder mine ; now there is but one, and it
will probably close up. The proprietors of some of these
foundries convinced the Tariff Commission that they
could make mining machinery as good as any imported
from England, and make it cheaper, but, all the same, they
can’t get orders except from small, locally-owned shows.
The big mines are owned in England, and there is tip and
backsheesh and secret commission to be got when the
orders are given by men in England to other men in
England. So Australia, which supplies two millions a
year in dividends to thebloated English absentee, doesn’t
even get the job of making a TO-head battery in return.
Yes, Westralia requires that new tariff darned bad.
Some kindly words from Ophir :
Dead, September 4, at Ophir (N.S.W.), Old Man
Singleton, aged 89, for 50 years the western diggers’
friend. Lewis Ponds rush was in torrent when Singleton
opened his 10ft. x Bft. butcher’s shop, and men fought
like wolves for his Bathurst meat before it was off the
cart. The outcome of which w'as, for Singleton, a sub-
stantial waj side inn, a wife, and prosperity. The boozers
having departed, the inn became a store, and from behind
his counter the old man watched the field wane till
only hatters, fossickers, and eventually pensioners,
remained. His life-track w'as littered with deeds of
kindness, and, consequently, he died compara-
tively poor in pocket, but rich in esteem. A
few weeks before his illness (influenza) a man
walked from Orange, 20 miles away, to pay him £3 75.,
an 18-year-old debt. Of this sum £2 W'as money that had
crossed the counter outwards with the words, “ Ay, nlon,
but ye’ll want a pound for the track.” About the same
tim.-another digger sent along Maclaren’s “ Auld Lang
Syne ” inscribed “To Thomas Singleton. A small token
of gratitude.-” Many “returns” of this kind gave the
old man pleasure, and he mentioned them ; but other-
wise he was dumb as to his own share in such trans-
actions. A kindly, generous, open-handed Scotchman
was Old Man Singleton.
This is by an embittered Labor voter :
Had N.S.W. Labor party only possessed the common-
sense to come out at the recent election as the party of
Nationhood, and denounced Carruthers and his gang as
nation-w'reckers, traitors who were striving to break up
the union that alone can save the continent from one
day being overrun by Asiatics, they w’ould probably have
wrecked the Government. Carruthers made the fight a
fiscal one, and the Labor party was apparently, as usual,
bounced by its loud-mouthed Foreign-Trade minority into
not accepting- that challenge. Had it done so, and
boldly declared itself the champion of the policy of mak-
ing our own goods, so as to find work for our own people,
and to encourage people to come here and join in the
process of Nation-building, they would have swept the
polls. But the trouble in the Labor party is that
there isn’t a man in it with big ideas, or the
instincts of a leader. Jimmy McGowen isgetting old and
slothful, and, anyhow, he never was troubled With a
superfluity of ideas. Holman, his lieutenant, is a
Foreign-trade fanatic who babbles about “ the natural
protection of distance,” regardless of the fact that
freights from New' York are on many things lower than
from Melbourne to Sydney. Also, he is a physically
weak man with pdtt-de-foie-gras tastes and smoked-cod
pockets, and by the time he has attended to his private
business he hasn’t the physical strength to wade into a
big political fight. There is nothing practical in his
composition, and his own party does not trust him
overmuch. Edden is also old and lacking in energy,
although he certainly has brains. So has Griffith, but
Griffith is obsessed by the borrowing craze, and he hasn’t
the first essential of a great leader—the ability to get on
well with followers. The party lacks a man of commanding-
ability and energy; it is sorely afflicted with the State
Frights madness ; and it is so busy watching that the
Federal party does nothing to impair the prestige of the
State body that it doesn’t watch the enemy closely enough.
Carruthers comes back badly clawed from the recent
fight, and with his confidence shaken, and his party more
or less demoralised. With a man like Kingston leading
the Labor Opposition he could be hurled from power in a
month or two. But just at present no one seems to be
more frightened of the Labor party getting into pow’er
than its own members.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Some papers commit the shocking indeli-
cacy of describing the secesh-mongers of Westralia
as “bellicose.” Surely “bingeycose” would be
nicer and equally expressive. And what of
“ chestose ” or “ stomachose ” ?
The Yellow Pup had a very bad time at
N.S.W. State elections. Notable insectarians
like S. Law, Jessep, Hurley. Booth, and Anderson
were thrown out. Their defeat will leave politics
a little cleaner and saner.
The Victorian Assembly has rejected by
only two votes a Bill to cut down the salary of
the State Governor to £2OOO, with a view to
throwing in his purely rubber-stamp job with the
duties of the Chief Justice. Probably the
measure will pass the Assembly at next time of
asking, and then after the usual series of rejec-
tions it will get through the House of Rich Land-
lords also. The reform of the wretchedly
extravagant State system can’t begin better than
with the abolition of the imported Governor.
Seven imported Governors for 4,000,000 people
represent almost as vast a foolishness as the 44
mayors of Sydney.
ON OUR SELECTION .
AUSTRALIA : “ I’re got a decent fence up, so now
I think I'll go and clear the land.”
One Plunkett, M.L.A., urges Queensland
to secede from the Commonwealth because the
Federal authority “treats it like a conquered
State.” _ Most of these secessionists are painfully
suggestive of the youngest boarder at Lodgers’, by
reason of the large military language the harmless
creatures use. When the, Australian Parliament
begins burning farms round Brisbane, and sends
Plunkett to a concentration camp, he may get a
better idea of the relative sizes of things.
The damaged Carruthers, trying to explain
away the gains of his opponents, told his constitu-
ents at asocial that “Labor gained by the liquor
trade vote, and by that alone, and it saved their
seats as well.” Well, so far as the count had gone
when Carruthers told his cheeky tarradiddle, 51
electorates had carried reduction, and nine had
carried continuance, and of those nine that voted
as the liquor trade wanted them to, only two
were Labor electorates. Also, the Labor party
lost tvyo city seats, and in both of those districts
“ continuance ” was carried.
There is not the least danger in giving
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy to children, as it
contains no harmful drugs.*
A Melbourne man who had got the idea
from the daily papers that Australia is the only
country that ever sticks up an immigrant was
badly shocked, the other day. He booked a
passage to America at the Union Co.’s office,
and was amazed at a demand for four dollars,
poll-tax. He thought he had struck some-
thing in the shape of a new fraud,
whereupon it was explained to him
that Uncle Sam believes that the
best way to get desirable immi-
grants is to keep the undesirable
ones out, wherefore it care-
fully checks its immigrants,
and makes them pay the cost
of the checking. The poll-
tax for that purpose was for
a long while two dollars ;
lately it was put up to
four dollars. While it was
two dollars the shipping
cos. charged it in along
with the fare; now that
it is four dollars they col-
lect it separately. The
Australian paid, and now
has less respect for Austra-
lian daily paper yarns.
Geelong (Vic.) is
quite wideawake in
patches, in spite of its
reputation. When its Har-
bor Trust was lately
formed it was handed
the old racecourse to help
it to pay its way; and in-
stead of leasing it for
grazing purposes, or put-
ting a few sheep on the
paddock, the Trust wired
in with vigor and drain-
ing tools, and soon had
the land ready to lay
down with clover, maize
and other fodder crops.
Then it built a silo, put
up a fine milking-shed
where 50 cows could be
milked simultaneously,
got in milking machines,
separator, etc., and now
starts out to pay its wav
with some 150' selected
cows. If it but gives
decent wages to its farm
hands, the Trust will be running a choice sample
of socialism—though it would probably be hor-
ribly annoyed if anybody said so.
The revelations made by Minister O’Sulli-
van when introducing- the Wages Board Bill into
tne (Queensland Assembly show that, while Reid,
Hinchcliffe and co. have been assiduously fighting
Kidston and other imaginary foes, a sweating
system unparalleled elsewhere in Australia has
grown up under the shadow of the Trades’ Hall
One Brisbane firm, employing 84 hands, pays 53
of them the munificent average of 3s. 7d. per week.
After all, Providence does work in a
mysterious way, turning the most unlikely in-
struments to good, and apparently Joseph the
Trisect is to serve a really patriotic purpose.
His ravings against the Commonwealth have
done more to advance the idea of Unification
than five years’ hard agitation by enthu-
siastic • patriots could have done. People
grow weary of the everlasting snarl, the con-
tinual wail, and the childish, ridiculous
efforts to hamper and harass the Australian
Government. “If this is what Federation
means, by all means let’s abolish it,” is the
feeling stirred up by Carruthers. But Austra-
lians, knowing that union is the only hope
of avoiding either conquest or the death of
the nation in battle when Asia slops
are not going back. They must go on. The
Asiatic menace on the northern horizon makes
retrogression impossible, and if something
has to go, it will not be the Australian Go-
vernment. That has come to stay, and if it
is to be hampered by cantankerous State
penny politicians, then the States must be
wiped out and the Federation replaced by
a unified Australia.
The Maoriland Government begins to
realise now the huge blunder of old Lands
Minister Jock McKenzie when he devised
the 999-years lease of State lands. The lands
were given at a low rental—already the State
finds they are worth, in many cases, twice
or three times the amount the lessees pay it
—yet these rents can’t be raised till about the
year 2900. The year 2900 is 'a dreadfully long
way off, and the only satisfaction the State
has is that it didn’t throw in a right of re-
newal. It threw in almost everything else.
An anguished cry from the press gallery
of the House of Reps. :
Three amazing members of the Opposition in the Reps,
have undertaken, on behalf of the rest of the Foreign-
traders, to amend Lyne’s Protective tariff. Their idea of
amendment is to cut every duty down to the rate at
which.it stood in the old Act or lower. The first of the
three is Fuller, who was one of the importers’ flunkeys on
the Commission. He regards it as a personal affront that
the Government (a Protectionist Government returned
to protect) should have ignored, in constructing the
tariff, the idiotic recommendations of the Foreign-traders
on the Commission. The second amender is Too-much
Johnson. He proposes to fall on all the duties that
Fuller happens to miss. Johnson has put in a list of
about iOO amendments, so the House will have to suffer
severely during the next few weeks, for each amendment
means an average of three speeches. Think of it—3oo
speeches by Johnson between now and Christmas. The
other anti-Protectionist is Liddell, Willie Kelly’s playmate
in the House. He wants to cut down the duty on patent
medicines and baby-poisons and abortion nostrums, and
to suppress Octavius C. Beale’s exposure of the rotten-
ness of most of the patent nostrums. Yet Liddell pre-
tends to be a doctor. Surely, even a Foreign-trade
doctor ought to like to see duties put on baby-poisons.
If you have a bad cough don’t rely upon
ordinary soothing cough mixtures, but take
Angier’s Emulsion, which not only cures the most
obstinate cough, but promotes appetite, aids di-
gestion and benefits the entire system. In three
sizes, of all chemists.*
RE FOOLS AND EDGED TOOLS.
I once gave a foolish man a stockwhip, and he cracked
it over his head, and in six minutes he had six men fight-
ing.— CARRUTHERS, at Bexley, G/9/07.
N.S.W. : “ Dunno as how he hasn’t gone and
done the same silly thing again.”
Molb. Argus was landed in a bog the
other day. Justice Hood had a wages appeal
case before him, and he decided that there was
no evidence that the tariff had increased prices
to any extent, or, even if it had, that such
increase was likely to be permanent, conse-
quently there was no reason for increasing wages.
Yet, though the blessed paper had all along been
saying that the “ drastic tariff ” was robbing the
poor worker, and driving him to insolvency, it
dare not annoy the employer by saying that
wages ought, therefore, to go up. So it just for-
got all that it had said about the “ drastic tariff, ”
and approved of Justice Hood cordially.
“C.C.D.” (from Westralia) ; Consider
this advertisement :
WEAR a SECESSION MEDAL.
6d. Each.
And Support “ HOME RULE for W.A.”
MARTIN and CO. Ltd.,
Chemists, 111 Barrack-street, Perth.
I send you the pill-dealer’s .medal. After you
have looked at it, give it to the office dog. If the
dog doesn’t want it, give it to your N.S.W.
Premier. But let the dog have first pick.
Not warned by the rebuff that Carruthers
got at N.S.W. elections. Queensland Premier
Kidston gives a sort of half-and-half sympathy to
the secessionists in his State. Queensland, it
seems, has also “wrongs,” and unless something
is done William the Bookseller “would be pre-
pared to support a movement for separation.”
Possibly Kidston knows that this is blithering
nonsense, and only talks it because he thinks it will
be popular. But when Federalism reruns Anti-
Federalism becomes a real issue at any State
election the State Frights will find their mistake.
So far the public has done nothing serious to them
because it regards the secesh party as a harmless
loony—same as the person who abolishes God
and the British empire every Sunday on a candle-
box in Sydney Domain to an audience of a boy,
a dog scratching its ear, and two men smoking
bad tobacco.
No one of the Sydney dailies has given a
clean, truthful account of the state of par-
ties after the elections. (It is very difficult to
understand why even a partisan paper should de-
liberately distort the facts; but it seems to be
the rule.) Consider first the Labor party. It
went into the contest with 25 seats ; it comes out
with 32. It won nine seats from Carruthers, and
lost two seats to Independents (Norton and
Meagher). That really is the key to Joseph’s
“victory.” He lost nine seats to the direct Oppo-
sition, and several others to Independents. After
the previous elections he had 46 seats. During
the life of the Parliament lie amalgamated with
the Opposition (led by Waddell). Now he and
Waddell have 43 seats between them. In the city
and suburbs, last Parliament, Labor had six seats.
Two it lost to Independents ; five it won from
Carruthers. Now it has nine seats. In the
country the Labor party used to have 19 seats.
Now it has 23. It lost two to Carruthers, and
won six from him.

A cold your nose should tint,
On no account take anything
For it but Peppermint.
We all are liable to colds,
Or frequently to cough,
On hand keep Woods’ mighty Cure,
Don’t put this matter off.*
This is a gocrcVtime-tir)- remember Aloysius
Fox. It is a good .time for M’s.P. to remerpber
hiin—in order to call to mind the agencies by
which Kingston’s tariff was cut up. Also it is a
good time for the “agents” to remember Aluy-
sius. The importers diddled him out of part of
his wages last time. The terms for lobbying and
treachery ought to be C.O.D. on this occasion.
When you are hired to “cripple an Australian
industry,” as A. Fox was, trust no man !
One yarn of the Foreign-traders is that
the Australian Government in framing the 1907
tariff “absolutely ignored” the report of the
Tariff Commission. But a very little examination
will show that the new tariff practically repre-
sents the recommendations of the Protectionist
wing of the Commission plus a 5 per cent, (in
some cases 10 per cent.) surtax on foreign goods
in order to give a preference to Britain.
The curious rumor that Germany will
guarantee the inviolability of the United States
eastern coast while Uncle Samuel’s navy goes
round, to the west to argue points if necessary with
the .Jap—even though it may be only a rumor—
suggests possible complications in the future.
The U.S. has the second largest fleet on the
seas, and is building fast. Germany has the
third best fleet, if not the third largest,
but seeing that the Parliament has entrusted
Kaiser, William with, £172,000.000 (that’s' all)
that he may wade in and build 18 battleships
each stronger than the Dreadnought, and other
vessels to match, it will be something much better
than third before long. An alliance between the
U.S. and Germany might relegate Britain to a back
seat on the waters. And it is ominous that the
first hint of'such an alliance arose out of the
Monkey, whom Britain has made its ally and
helped to bloat into such prominence that he has
heed hie the centre of international complications.
The British empire may yet fall over that ill-
starred Monkey and break its neck. Already the
Jap alliance has filled India with clamor and dis-
affection, and infuriated the Indian soldiery, who
regard it as a 'reflection on their courage that
another Asiatic race should be asked to guarantee
the safety of India; it has alarmed Australia; it
has driven Canada’s Pacific Coast, which has to
be sacrificed to jap immigration, to riot and
frenzy; and it is rumored that it has made, or
may make, the U.S. look for an ally in Britain’s
worst enemy.
“ Vulcan ” writes
Premier beetle Carruthers, of N.S.W., may fix his smile
till bis face aches, and blither about his delight
at the election results till he bursts, but he’s been
severely bumped, and he knows it. The concussion
would have been much more severe but for Joseph’s fore-
sighted, underhand election engineering. F’rinstance,
instead of letting Parliament decay to the bitter end.
staving off the elections right up to the last day allowed
by law, he might conveniently have taken the poll a
month or six weeks back, and so allowed the bush workers
to vote before they scattered for the shearing and its
attendant occupations. Having-g-ot them away from home,:
and off the premises, as it were, they were made doubly
harmless to Joseph by the careful omission of a postal
vote from the recent Electoral Amendment Act. That
this wholesale disfranchisement scandal mightn’t be too
noticeable, Chief Secretary Twaddle promised that every
shed employing 20 shearers would be made a polling
booth, but he swallowed his word, and the concession
was suddenl.y cancelled just prior to the election. Thus
thousands of shearers, shed hands, wool-classers, etc.
(Laborites to a 7iian, almost) were purposely rooked of
their votes—and just what this meant to Joseph, some of
the narrow Deform majorities show. In the towns, where
Joseph’s election finesse wasn’t applicable, he had the
luck of a shipwrecked hen. Now a much-battered Joe-
insect crawls back on the crutch of an intentionally dis-
honest political job ; but he has learned a lesson, and
many promised anti-Federal snarls will be buried hurriedly
and silently, and forbidden mention in the family.

THE BULL PUP: “Just ter be in the fashion.

This is the S.A. Senate election muddle
up to date : —(1) It was announced that Yardon
was elected; (2) further returns came in, and
Crosbie was elected ; (3) Vardon appealed for a
recount as against Crosbie, and Crosbie lost his
job ; (4) Crosbie died without knowing of the dis-
aster that nad befallen him ; (5) Blundell, another
candidate, appealed for a recount as against
Yardon, and the matter went to the High Court;
(6) the High Court received the staggering news
that the ballot papers for Angas district
had been carelessly burnt, and not being
able to decide the relative merits of Yardon and
Blundell without them, it annulled the election as
far as they were concerned ; (7) the official who
allowed the papers to be burnt was fined £lO ;
(8) the S.A. State Legislature elected O’Loghlin
on the ground that it was an extraordinary
vacancy as provided by the Act; (9) Vardon
appealed to the High Court to declare that it was
an ordinary vacancy, and to order an election, but
was defeated ; (10) Yardon appealed to the Senate
itself ; (11) the allegedly burnt ballot papers have
turned up, and the fined official wants his £lO
back again, and the Attorney-General is thinking
over tilings. But. seeing that the High Court
case is closed, it isn't easy to see what he can do.

THE UNRIPE TIMES
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The time is ripe.— Stodgy statement by advocates of
anything unimportant.
The time is not yet ripe.— Solemn assertion of the
stodgy press a,bout anything important.
Bid me not “rise ” from slumber deep
To do the things that should be done ;
Nor bid me “ wake ” —l’m not asleep,
But see as much as anyone,
And onU wait, with beer and pipe,
Until the time is fully ripe.
The bridging of some little creek,
A small remission in the taxes,
Or anything that they may seek
Who grind (politically) axes,
In small ways that small minds will please—
The time is always ripe for these.
But (though I know it must be built)
The making of a guarding wall,
Which means some energy and .gilt,
Can wait—’tis merely national !
Time will be ripe, it seems to me,
When all the fruit drops from the tree.

Metrop. first favorite Mooltan’s manner of
winning Spring Handicap of 1J mile, at Tatt.’s Randwick
meeting on Saturday, makes his chance in the big mile
event look particularly rosy. It is difficult to pick one

Mooltan’s Spring Handicap weight was 7st. 101 b., and he
landed the money easily in 2min. 7Jsec. —ljsec. outside
Hova’s Australian record.

Rawson Stakes (w.f.a., lm. If.) field was
rather high class, and, through being much fancied and
weightily supported for coming big spring events, the
running of Maranui, Poseidon- (Caulfield Cup favorite),
Comely (Melbourne Cup favorite), N.S.W. top-notch
sprinter Collarit, and Derby colts—Mountain King
and Peru—was closely watched. Collarit made the
pace solid to the distance, where Mountain King
came like a whirlwind and won easily. Poseidon
finished just behind Collarit. Maranui never looked
dangerous, and Comely’s display wasn’t the least
bit encouraging. Mountain King, who promises excel-
lently, is a big youngster, by Wallace from Bonnie
Rosette, and consequently brother to Scottish King and
Bonnie Chiel. He has engagements in A. J.C. and V.R.O.
Derbies and Melbourne Cup, with 7st. 51b. Collarit’s show-
ing was particularly good, everything considered, and
placed his Epsom supporters on pleasant terms with them-
selves. Peru (giving the winner 141 b.) did well enough to
please his followers.

Working a commission nowadays is a greater
art than taking a city was in the davs of Joshua and
Jericho. Told that the owner of lolaire, the Victorian
first favorite for the Epsom Handicap, raked in such
splendid odds that he could stand on velvet to the extent
of £3OOO to nothing by laying off £2OOO of the £5OOO
secured from the Sydney branch of Christian Moses and

Pass the prophet’s robe ! A more than likely
winner of A.J.C. Epsom turned up in Legation, who won
the Tramway Handicap, at Tatt.’s Randwick meeting, on
Saturday, in an impressive manner. He came down from
Wallsend, where he had appropriated the Shorts and
Stewards’ Handicaps, and, with a penalty of 71b. added
to his Bst. 41b., beat a g’ood field over the six furlongs in
Imin. 13Jsec., which was only fsec. outside record time.
He will hump 151 b. less in the Epsom Handicap, and
should shake things up. His breeding is all quality, his
sire being imported Diplomat (St. Simon—Tact, by
Wisdom), and his dam the well-known Sj'dney performer
Kallatina. A dangerous rival, though, is four-year-old
Lord Beauchamp, who, with 7st. 121 b. up, made a one-
horse affair of Saturday’s Welter in the fast time of lmin.
40jsec. His Epsom weight is a feather—6st. 71b.

There are grave doubts whether the present
Caulfield Cup favorite, Poseidon, will be seen in the big
V.A.T.C. race, as he is among the entrants for Craven
and Randwick Plates. Randwick Plate will be worth
close upon £BOO, and looks a softer snap than Caulfield
Cup. And Poseidon is hardly likely to go for both, for
seeing the A.J.C. meeting through means that the horse
cannot reach Melbourne till a few days before the Caul-
field event.

N.S.W., especially up country, is just now
suffering from a plague of “balancers.” Balancers differ
from welshers inasmuch as they refund holders of win-
ning tickets their own money after carefully collecting
and destroying the tickets. Those who back the ones
that finish behind the winner, of course, get nothing.
And at present there seems to be no arm of the law that
can touch this person. Even Wade’s far-reaching Act
rebounds harmlessly off the balancer’s thick hide.
Yet it is plain thievery, and why on earth balancers
cannot be prosecuted for receiving money under false
pretences, writer cannot imagine.

Consider the degenerate quality of the hurdlers

Saturday last. J

Australia experienced something like a shock
on Sunday and Monday last, when it learned that a Tas-
manian team had, at Eiphin Show Ground, Launceston’
roused itself from sleep and walloped Victoria at lacrosse
by the decisive score of eight goals to three. And it was
no chance victory either, but a fair win by the faster and
better team. The Tassies started with a terrific attack
and took three goals in quick succession. They beat the’
Victorians right out, and prevented them even gettino-
near the goal the whole quarter. In the second”
the Victorians got off the mark first and pressed
home, netting a couple of goals. The Tassies
were apparently a little tired, but towards the
end of the quarter they pulled themselves to-
gether and scored another goal, which made them
leaders at half-time by four to two. The second
half proved that any apparent tiredness was merely
play acting, for the Tasmanians suddenly appeared fresh
as a long beer on a hot day. Their combination was
much ahead of the Victorians, and their stamina
judgment, and stick work were also superior. The
Victorian crowd was superior in defence, but very wild
when attacking, and the Tasmanians showed' their
judgment by following up repulses and scoring, before
the Victorians could get properly on the defensive. The
individual play of the visitors was said to be “beautiful ”
but it was powerless against the superior combination of
the Tassies, who in the second half scored four goals
while the individualists made a solitary one.

N.S.W. had easily the better of the inter-State
baseball rubber with Victoria. It won the first match by
10 to four, and the second by 16 to 12. Then the fortune
of war changed with a bang, and the Victorians climbed
out of Saturday’s match right on top of the heap with 12
to seven. This gives N.S.W. a lead in the rubbers, it
having won four to Victoria’s three, while counting games
the score is: N.S.W. 12, Victoria nine.
Baseball is gaining ground. Hitherto people
have regarded it as a sort of glorified edition of rounders
which it is ; but the point is that it has become so glori-
fied that unusual skill is required to play it. The fielding
■ •alls for higher grade qualities than are needed in cricket
and wicket-keeping isn’t in it with the position of the
catcher, who has to be protected by liver pads, diaphra<>m
protectors and a meat safe over his face, and has to wear
a glove larger than a frying pan to give him a show of
stopping the ball. But the marvel of the game is the
pitching. The cricketer makes the ball break right or
left as he chooses, but he has the resistance of the earth
to work on. The baseball pitcher has to use merely
the resistance of the air, and cultivate the art
of making 1 the globe travel in two directions
at once. By means of “side,” which the forward
movement neutralises, and finally wears out, he makes it
go right or left, up or down, in a rounded curve, or in a
sudden break at an acute angle. One paper, expatiating
on the charms of baseball, pointed out that there was no
possible opening for rough play, and next day the first
man that essayed to wield the club stopped the ball with
the point of his nose. Next, he was seen on his back,
kicking, and then the ambulance trotted along, and he
was removed to have a new face affixed. The absence of
rough play is, unfortunately, not quite a solid guarantee
of safety. Many people have been killed in this world
without any rough play- for instance, the preacher who
was struck by lightning, just as he said “Fourthly.”
The semi-finals of the Sydney Soccer sudden
death struggle for the Gardiner Gup on Saturday saw the
premier club, Pyrmont, send Balmain down to join the
innumerable procession, while Petersham and Broad-
meadow struggled vainly to prove which was superior,
the game ending in a draw, with one goal each. They will
play off again this Saturday, and the winner will play the
final with Pyrmont. Writer’s money is on Pyrmont !
Owing,to the high feeling, the P.vrmont-Balmain meeting
degenerated into a wild rough-and-tumble and a series of
intermittent scraps. The first half, though scoreless,
saw many narrow escapes on both sides—in fact’
there were nearly as many close shaves as illegalities’,
and their name was legion. As a rule a Soccer game in
Sydney is quite a model performance, and a bright and
shining example to the followers of other sports ; but
both sides carefully jettisoned everything of that sort
before starting on Saturday. In spite of the illegalities,
it was. a beautiful game to watch, both sides ivere in such
deadly earnest. A Pyrmont player was sent off the
ground for smiting an opponent’s nose, and Balmain was
penalised for tripping, and amidst the general confusion
Pyrmont cleared its line, and spent the rest of the time
in a succession of rough and tumble contests, till the
whistle blew and gave it the victory by one point to nil.

The Broadmeadow-Petersham match was inter-
esting, and w'as much better football, but the general
impression that the teams were merely struggling to
decide which should be runner-up robbed it of’much of
its.interest. But it didn’t affect the players any, and
they played with all their souls and all their feet. Peter-
sham, by brilliant play, drew first blood—one goal to nil.
Getting round the Broadmeadow goal, the Petersham
men lost their heads, and Broadmeadow, from a penalty
kick, equalised the score. During the whole of the
second half Petersham attacked all it knew, and
Broadmeadow put up a splendid defensive game.
Although Petersham was attacking so furiously that
its own goal was quite neglected, it failed to break
through the country club’s defence when time ran out.
In order to facilitate the sudden death, the authorities
ordered the clubs to play on an extra five minutes, and
Petersham continued to rage like the French cavalry at
Waterloo. But the defence was impregnable, and' the
pair will meet again on Saturday.

The closing struggles of the N.S.W. Football
League (Austral Rules) competition aroused much more
interest than usual this year. On Saturday week
Newtown squelched Redfern, and then stood bv to see
Sydney and East Sydney on Saturday decide which of
them would play it in the final. Both sides played a
pretty game, which was human chess of a high order,
and in the end, after a most exciting contest, Sydney
won by 48 points to 35. Next week it will play off
with Newtown to decide which club is champion for
the season. Newtown was premier club last year
and Sydney the year before. Their relative
positions in the competition are: Sydney first, with 52
competition points ; Newtown second, with 46 points.
Newtown has scored 898 points against its opponents
during theseason, and hashad4lsscoredagainstit. Sydney
has scored 829 to 371. The third on the list is East
Sydney, which was premier club in 1903. The most
grievous fall is that of North Shore, which held the
premiership in 1904, and this year is second last with only
12 competition points.

In the expectation of witnessing a strenuous
argument between Carlton and St. Kilda, in the second
Victorian League semi-final, an extra thousand or so
people passed the turnstiles at the Melbourne Ground on
Saturday. They left disgusted. After ascending rocket-
like in May and June, Saints descended just as swiftly in
July and August. Latterly they had recovered somewhat
and promised something of the form they showed in the
first match this year, when they ran over Carlton by 8.8 to
4.6. Alas ! the promise was words and naught else. While
perhaps half-a-dozen of the 18 Seasiders spent themselves
in solid graft, the whole of the lighter Carltonians
worked together like a machine without rush or flurry.
Within a minute of the start the blue-and-whites had
scored a goal, and after that the day was theirs. At
quarter-time the board showed four goals two behinds to
one goal ;at half-time, 9.5 to 2.2. There was a brief flash
on resuming • attacking fiercely, the Saints kicked
four behinds in as many minutes, and followed them with
a goal. With better luck or straighter kicking, so as to
have turned all those five chances into goals
they might have had a hope, but it is doubt-
ful. The swifter and more dashing Northerners
could have given the others all the luck in and then
won. Collingwood’s exhibition the previous week showed
that it had temporarily lost its form, but St. Kilda
played as if it never had any to lose, and the figures at
the finish—l3.l3 to 4.ll—correctly indicated the relative
play of the teams. The Seasiders have one small con-
solation, however —-they stand third on the premiership
list, and as they have never in all their history stood
higher, and as it is 33 years since they last reached even
that giddy eminence, there is a hope for them next year
if they will confine themselves to moderate-sized Panamas
and belltoppers. The team was photographed at half-
time in view of the chiaclting multitude ; Carlton wasn’t
—and Carlton won.

On the East Melbourne ground a dense crowd
watched Footseray and Williamstown decide the first
semi-final. Being neighbors, the teams love one another
like the devil, especially as ’Town, determined to gain
the pennant or bust, has seduced ex-League players
into its ranks per medium of billets in the railway work-
shops ; so the discussion was willing. It became so
joyous, in fact, during the third quarter that even the
umpire got trodden on, and had to retire to nurse a
damaged ankle. Being replaced by another, the bar-
rackers incontinently jumped to the insane conclu-
sion that the first had been compulsorily relieved
and while some tore the remnants of his
character to shreds, others assured the new man
that sudden death awaited him if he failed to give satis-
faction. He was a good enough umpire, just as good as
the damaged official, and the fact that the Footseray
“ supporters ” departed in a violent rage was solely due
to the superiority of the ’Town players, who scored 5 11
to 3.9, but dynamite couldn’t drive that idea into their
heads. Here, as at the League match, the hard «r o und
gave a slippery foothold, and made for scratchy, scram-
bling play ; but all through ’Town played the better of
what football there was, which wasn’t much.

Saturday afternoon, Sept. 7, saw a great
crowd on the Association Ground, Launceston, while the
City club (Northern premiers) and the Lefroy (Southern
ditto) decided which crowd of “ muddied oafs ” was boss
of the Speck. After a fast and open, hut not unduly
scientific, game the Northern footballers asserted their
right to do all the crowing for 12 months, scoring 5.12 to
2.3. They are a placid, sedate lot these apple-eaters, and
the barrackers seldom got beyond “Blime”; consequently
it is not surprising to learn that the losers subsequently
congratulated the winners as much on their fine
manly game as on their superior play ; while the umpire
—an ex-Vic. League official—“ gave satisfaction to all
parties,” as a Launceston report put it. As the said
umpire, when in Melbourne, was reckoned so unsatis-
factory that at least one League team refused to play
under him, he has either improved somewhat or else the
Tassies are more easily pleased. A community that has
suffered a House of Dodery for any length of time is apt
to be satisfied with anything.
Mr. J. J. Giltinan, hon. sec. of the N.S.W.
Rugby Football League, writes : “ Your statement that
the players are already full of Trumper, Kelly, Giltinan
and Co. is totally without foundation. . . Mr. Kelly has
not, and never had, anything to do with the new move-
ment in football. If the players are getting full, it is
very amazing that their names are coming in from near
and far, so those who are getting full of it do not belong
to the League. With reference to the gentry who are to
take their cash out of the League, this is another fabrica-
tion. . . for the gentry referred to have no money what-
ever in the movement. The money standing to the
credit of the N.S.W.R.F.L. belong's to the League, and
the League only, and the League does not want any
capital. . . They do not want any advice from the inventor
of the paragraph in the issue of The Bulletin of Septem-
ber sth. . . With reference to the life membership: The
resolution passed by the committee (pro tern,) was
subject to the approval of the incoming body which will
govern the N.S.W. Rugby Football League. 'The special
committee appointed to frame the constitution is hard
at work drawing same up, and when finished it will be
submitted to the clubs for confirmation. . . I, J. J.
Giltinan, the main promoter of the League and one of
the executive, challenge your writer, or anyone else, to
say I have belonged to anv organisation or ever
took partin any sport of any kind that was not carried
on straight, clean, and above board, and I say again that
I will not countenance or assist in anything but a
straightforward movement in any organisation to which
I belong.”
To which The Bulletin replies : It is interest-
iiig to learn that neither Mr. Giltinan nor Mr. Trumper
has any money invested in the League, as that merely
proves the gentry have already taken their cash out of it
without being asked to do so. Mr. Giltinan has
repeatedly been reported as having said that it was his
good money that was put up to start the movement in
N.S.W., and he said so to the writer. So, unless he is a
philanthropist who gave away his good money for
nothing, he has already taken it out. That is, of course,
unless the League consists of Mr. Giltinan. The secre-
tary s explanation of the life membership is accepted as
satisfactory, and sympathy is hereby extended to him in
his struggle with the constitution. Constitutions are
hard things to make. The writer never charg'ed Mr.
Giltinan with doing anything* crooked, unclean, or under-
hand. It is quite possible to run a purely professional
football business in a perfectly straig’ht, clean, and above-
board manner, and this paper is not imputing anything
dishonorable to Mr. Giltinan or anyone associated with
him when it criticises his doings with the League. All
this writer is concerned with is the question whether Mr.
Giltinan s method of running the League is likely to
increase the practice of healthy athleticism among the
young men of the community. At present, he is of the
opinion that it is not.
* * *
A rather humorous sequel to the wholesale dis-
qualification of players by the Sydney Metropolitan
Rugby Union was the howl of J. J. Giltinan, secretary of
the Rugby League, that the Union hadn’t disqualified
even more men than it did. Just that there should be
no mistake, he mentioned the names of a lot of players
who had earned disqualification, but whose claims to
obloquy had been ignored by the Rugby Union. Of
course, the more players Giltinan can get disqualified,
the better chance he has of pulling his League club
organisation through. The Union recognises that fact,
and by exercising a fine, masterful restraint it drives
poor Giltinan almost wild.

Sydney District Football Club (Rugby) has
come to the conclusion that it must either eat or be
eaten. At present the recruiting area is too limited to
make it possible to maintain a first-grade team without a
continual struggle, and the club has grown tired. So it
is taking a referendum as to whether the club will con-
tinue as it is in the event of the Metropolitan Union
refusing to extend the boundaries, or disband and be
absorbed by Eastern Suburbs and Glebe. The Bulletin
thinks the latter course would be the more advisable.
Sydney’s case seems pretty hopeless, and its division
would he a god send to Eastern Suburbs, which was so
badly hit by the rise of the League.

The N.S.W. Rugby League is just about turn-
ing up its toes. Reason: Mr. Carruthers has found time,
in spite of being busy losing seats and smuggling wire-
netting, to condemn “Professionalism”.—in football, or
anything else, in fact, but the coursing of red herrings.
He’s “ professional ” in that himself.

There have been some grumblings about the
composition of the English XI. that is to come to Aus-
tralia, and Bendigo, which is booked for one match, sent
a long wire of expostulation to the Board of Control,
requesting it to protest to the Marylebone Club that this
was not the sort of team that was expected. As a matter
of fact, it is a good team, and one that, if it gets
going, will score rapidly. They are all fast
scorers when they start, and, the Australian
bowling being anything but sensational, the'" visi-
tors will, in all probability, prove quite formidable
enough. When the Board got Bendigo’s wire it sat back
a,nd breathed hard. Then the fighting secretary grasped
his pen firmly, put his hat on the back of his head, and
wrote to the effect that the Board thought the team a
very good one, was quite satisfied with it, and wouldn’t
protest. He also assured Bendigo that, if it didn’t think
it w'orth while having a match with such inferior players
there, he could place the date elsewhere. Further while
he was writing, he would beg to remind Bendigo that its
whack of the guarantee of £*lo,ooo which the Board had
to give had not materialised, and a cheque would greatly
oblige. Since then Bendigo has not been heard from.

Cricketers Lilley and Quaife have been having
a dust-up in the Birmingham (Eng.) courts, with frequent
adjournments to allow them both to play cricket in the
Warwickshire county eleven. When they were in Aus-
tralia last they were always understood to be business part-
ners ; but it appears now that Lilley had sold out to the
brothers Quaife, and was merely trading off their bats
and things on commission, they having the right to make
use of his name. Now he says they are advertising as
“Lilley’s special preparation for wicket-keeping gloves”
some mess or gummy stuff or soup which he knows
nothing about, and wouldn’t be seen dead with ; also
that they keep an assistant who looks like him, and who
smiles without contradiction when addressed by cus-
tomers as “Mr. Lilley.” The Quaifes retort thatLilley
is lending his valuable name and services to a rival firm ;
and the good sportsmen and old friends are hurling in-
junctions and mandamuses at each other, and Costs have
already mounted up higher than a bat standing on end
* * * *
At last the cricket sky is absolutely clear—
never a cloud in sight. The Board of Control has elected
McAlister, Darling, and Iredale as selectors of the teams
ivhich are to oppose the Englishmen. The players are to
receive £25 per match, which should deprive them of any
excuse for further trouble-making. The petition of the
players for separate representation came before the
Board. Darling, of South Australia, gravely proposed
that it be acceded to, and made a long speech in favor of
it. Unfortunately for the players, they had omitted to
show how they proposed to elect their representatives.
Neither did they show where “the players” ended and
the mere ordinary cricketer began. A'player is a wide
vague term. Mr. Darling could not throw anv light on
that side of the case, and frankly admitted he had not
thought over it. He hadn’t the least idea how the players
would elect their reps. He did not know whether they
would elect another subsidiary association to choose them,
or whether any man who played cricket would be en-
titled to vote for the said reps., or anything about it.
There was absolutely no machinery. So'with one accord
the Board turned the whole proposal down, and at pre-
sent it seems to be about as dead as the late lamented
Demetrius Poliorcetes.

America has bumped with force against one of
those curious English damfool shnesses that no man can
understand who hasn’t been reared in the land where
they pronounce “ Marjoribanks ” as “ Marchbanks,” and
tolerate Freetrade, a House of Lords, and the local
climate. The committee of the Jamestown (U.S.A.) Fair,
noting that English amateur cricketers are willing
always (fora share of the gate money) to go on tour like
S h? wm , en ’ ma, ie a straight business proposition
toi une Oxford and Cambridge rowing crews, offering the
latter good terms if they would come to the States and
race at Jamestown. The suggestion was declined by the
crews, with the shudder and scorn of the melodrama
heroine to whom the cigarette-fiend villain has made the
1 loposal Infamous. Also, the British sporting press rose
up and emptied buckets of contempt upon Jamestown
tor its ignorance, and several of the amateur oarsmen of
England (who won’t take money) were interviewed by a
number of the amateur cricketers of England (who
will take money), whereupon the former, as with one
voice, observed “ Haw,” and complained to the
latter ot the ‘ d-—d impertinence” of the sugges-
tion, and the cricketers heartily sympathised, and
reiterated Haw” and “Damme” and other things.
But to America the whole grievance remains as mean-
lngless as a Tower Beefeater. Here is the view of Caspar
ii fl lt, " e T> a J ea( J in B' Yankee amateur sport, in Outing:—
If English gentlemen cricketers had no objection to
having junketing trips, with all exes paid, and were so
pleased with arrangements as to mulct the Philadelphia
angels for drinks and laundry as well, why should not
the gentlemen oarsmen be as friendly disposed to a trip
at no cost to themselves, with a little sport thrown in to
give the junket color ? How were the square-toed
Jamestowmtes to know that the England, which smiles
upon the gentleman cricketer who is given his board and
lodging, and, if he is good enough at the wickets, other
things more remunerative, would fall in a fit of horrors at
the mere suggestion of paying the expenses of its gentle-
men oarsmen ? ”

Melba is said to have knocked Melbourne right
off its rocking chair with her new' motor car, a beautiful
six-cylindered Napier, the finest ever seen in Australia,
or probably anywhere else. It contains a lounge, which
is fitted with a patent electric device for signalling the
motor man, and is lit up with electric light. The tyres
are the famous Michelin Non-Skids. The Michelin tyres
ground every day. No less than 23 Fiat cars
W j C i. are k° arrive shortly are to be fitted with them,
and the same tyres earned golden opinion in the Targo-
Flono race this year, when the first six cars to arrive
were shod with them. So was that other fine car, the
Hotchkiss six-cylinder, that ran 10,000 kilometres through
France and 5000 miles through England.

Tr . Ter } Miles Cross Country Championship of
Victoria underwent a real baking time at the Caulfield
racecourse and surrounding country last Satur-
day. The heat played Old Harry 7 with some 169 coun-
tenances, including a few 7 bald ’eads, and the going
w 7 as hard. The field, representing 16 teams, faced
the starter at the Caulfield Cup barrier, and
at the whistle—the gun was left at home —
broke away with a helter skelter up the straight.
Passing the stand the second time round (1J mile cut
out in 7min. 59Jsec.), Suffren of Ballarat led, attended by
Itnrie, Steele, and Tassy champion Schofield. Leaving the
course at the back gate, Suffren went to nothing or got
lost. Aitken (Coburg) took command, and was fully
150 t yds. to the good at half way. On the return
journey Aitken increased his lead, eventually run-
ning in a winner by 200yds. from Oleines in 59min.
ssec. The third man, Schofield, was a clear 300yds. away,
third. The Tasmanians won the teams race from East
Melb., the favorites (Essendon) cracking up. Some 111
dry harriers completed the course.

Lang and Ruenalf waged a whirling scrap at
Broken Hill (N.S.W.) on Monday night. It was said to be
for the heavy-w r eight championship of Australia, though
how the gentry concerned figure out that championship
as vacant is a mystery. It soon became apparent that
Ruenalf was in for the father of a hiding, which Lang pro-
ceeded to administer in a firm, methodical manner. How-
ever, Ruenalf would not take a hiding, and, getting close,
used his feet more than his hands, and kicked earnestly
amidst the howls and curses of the crowd. The referee
gave Lang the fight on a foul, and Ruenalf then knocked or
wrestled Lang to the floor, and falling on him, hit and
kicked impartially till dragged off. Next, he tnrned on
one of the seconds and proceeded to deal it out. He was
hard at work when the crowd rushed the ring, and Sheol
broke loose and raged till the hall was cleared. What
between this affair and that Melbourne scrap, when
one fighter knocked the other down and sat him,
pugilism is getting very low down in Australia.
This is the very latest. After all the un-
utterable row about the alleged injury done to
N.S.W. by the new Federal tariff, Minister
Hogue last Monday assured a thin little meeting
at the Glebe to this effect:—
If these big-h duties now put in force, with the osten-
sible object of assisting certain industries, were to
remain, was it not plain that only the more powerful
States, Victoria and New South Wales, would benefit, and
the smaller States would suffer? ... It practically meant
ruin to the smaller States.
Even if Hogue holds a brief for the Sydney
importers and for the destruction of Australian
manufactures, he surely need not sink to such
unutterable drivel as this. The Senate has abso-
lute power to reject the tariff if it feels that way.
The “small States,” which Hogue says will be
ruined by the tariff (Queensland, Tasmania, S.A.
and Westralia), have 24 votes in the Senate
against the, 12 votes of N.S.W. and Vic-
toria the States which, Hogue says, are to
be enriched at the small States’ expense,
lhe small States can look after themselves
in the matter. They don’t require to be hor-
ribly wept upon by any patronising Hogue.
By the way, Hogue’s audience was so small that
even the Sydney Telegraph couldn’t find it in
its heart to describe it as more than “upwards
of 200.” The same paper gave it a big heading,
“ The Revolt of the People,” but even that poor
little “revolt” was only saved from failure by
the refusal of the chairman to allow anybody to
speak in opposition.
BILIOUSNESS.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills Reach the
Liver as no Other Remedy Does.
Biliousness, by its terrible effect upon the
spirits and energy of its victim, is one of the
most distressing of common ailments. Usually
preceded by irregularity of the bowels, it is
followed by severe headaches and dizziness and
total inability to do anything whatever. Many
medicines are simply purgatives operating on the
bowels only, and .having no permanent effect.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills act directly on the
liver, cleansing the bowels aud restoring the
system to its proper condition. Here is proof of
what we say
“I have great pleasure in stating that I owe
much to Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,” writes
Mrs. Thomas Cross, of West Moree. “Twelve
months ago I was suffering very acutely from
liver complaint and a very severe cold, which led
to bronchitis. I was also greatly troubled with
biliousness, which would bring on purging and
retching. At this time a friend of the family,
hearing I was bad, recommended Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. I procured a bottle and took
two pills regularly every night. Very soon I
noticed an improvement in my condition. My
cough became less troublesome and the phlegm
came away from the lungs, and breathing became
easier ; I could eat better, my appetite returned,
and I increased in weight. I completely
recovered, and now enjoy good health, which I
attribute to the regular use of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.”*

Sydney, in the new State Parliament, will
have hardly a representative of its old tradition
of Foreign-trade and Calico-Jimmyism. Consider
the members for Sydney : John Norton (free-
lance), R. D. Meagher (ditto), J. M‘Neill (Labor),
E. W. O’Sullivan (Radical Protectionist), E. C.
V. Broughton (liquor), with little Levy and
littler Jimmy Graham as the only representatives
of Reidism.
The importers might anyhow agree on one
yarn, and then stick to it. Just when the Sydney
and Melbourne crowd was at the height of its
screech that the tariff would ruin N. S. Wales
and squeeze the soul out of Victoria, Thurlow, a
Brisbane importer, was wailing that the Iniquity
was a device to benefit N. S. Wales and Victoria
at the expense of Queensland and Westralia.
The bulk shrinkage of one-time “Big-
john ” Forrest proceeds apace. Mahon, M.H.R.,
cornered him the other day, and jabbed him
severely with the points of his own former
speeches, and the squirming Forrest was goaded
into giving himself away :
Mahon : When the last tariff was being- discussed Mr.
Forrest voted for a 25 per cent, duty on mining
machinery.
Forrest: It was Ministerial and party loyalty that
made me do it. I won’t do it now. I voted a good many
times in ways I didn’t like.
It’s a pitiable admission for a “leading ’’politician
to make—that he jettisoned whatever conscience
he possessed for Ministerial place. Not so did
Kingston act when he lost touch with the
Cabinet —he went out on the instant. But then
Kingston is Kingston, and Forrest is only
Forrest.
“Leonardo” writes from an orchard :—•
With the Little Boy from Manly, I shout “Hooray"
for the new tariff, and on behalf of the fruit-growers of
N.S.W., I throw my tile at the welkin. Yet I know
very well that there are many who will not sup-
port my exuberant outcry, because they have, like
thousands of our other primary producers, become rabid
Freetraders from habit, and not from any sense of con-
viction or observation. They are much after the manner
of the horse that got into the habit of drinking at the
same shallow pool. This was all right while it
rained regularly, but there came a time when it didn’t
rain, and although there was a good hole of water only
100yds. away, the horse didn’t go there because habit was
too strong, and he kept on going to the dry hole day
after day till—well, he couldn’t go any longer.
But I don’t imagine such a sad fate for the fruit-
grower, because he isn’t a lone horse, but one of
thousands, and surely he must, in the end, follow some of
the wise ones to the full waterhole.
With the increased duties on fruits, both preserved and
green, there should be happy days and steady jobs for all
orchardiscs and vignerons throughout the State. Yet,
at the same time, we must not sit contentedly on the
fence and expect the new duties to come along in the
shape of a fairy godfather and gather up our products
in his great paternal commercial arms, and leave behind
a bag of golden sovereigns in exchange for the golden
russet or the muscatel. The producer, especially the
fruitgrower, must accept the new tariff as a huge
friendly helping-hand of opportunity. He must fashion
his co-operative jam-making and preserving concerns,
his pickle factories, his' controlling associations, his
water-conservation schemes, his irrigation ventures and
his commercial concerns, and place them in the big Pro-
tective palm and say, “ Keep a good hold of these ; they
are going to grow.”
Premier Bent ripped open the selfishness
of the Vic. landowning-councillor class when
lately dealing with the shire of Donald’s cadge
for money to make roads. “ I see you’ve an
eighteenpenny rate for the town portion of the
shire, but only a shilling for the rest of the
district. I’m sick of this separate riding busi-
ness. If one riding of a shire that is in funds
won’t help another, how can you expect the rest
of the State to help ? ” If the rich country land-
owners of Donald shire levied on themselves
the eighteenpenny rate they put on the township,
there would be no need for assistance ; but they
aren’t built that wav—they prefer to cadge.
“Melbournian” writes with needless en-
thusiasm about a man who seems to have been
instrumental in spending a hideous lot of good
money on dead bricks and foolish mortar, and who
has built many hollow places in which to house
dreams and echoes :
The Austral Light, Archbishop Carr’s official organ,
sums him up. “ Like the sun, he was the central force
of the past 20 golden years.” Born in Galway, 1839.
Studied at Tu&in. Entered St. Patrick’s College, Mav-
nooth. Ordained priest 1866. Six years afterwards he
returned to Maynooth, where he became Dean, Professor
of Theology, and Vice-President, till 1883, when he was
made Bishop of Galway. Received the pallium at
Rome, St. Patrick’s Day, 1887, as Archbishop of
Melbourne. When he arrived £150,000 had been
spent on St. Patrick’s Cathedral. He expended £90,000.
Total £240,000. Altogether, he has expended £383,134 on
churches, £104,592 on church schools, £92,836 on priests’
houses, and £48,597 on halls and club-rooms. In addition
to this total of £629,159, there is another colossal total of
£643,715 expended on other educational establishments
and charitable institutions. The whole amount spent on
Catholic education during the 20 years is £500,679.
The foundation stone of St. Patrick’s was laid
in 1858, and the interior completion was in 1897.
Howard Willoughby once wrote eloquently that it is a
pile looming over Melbourne, the first object as you
approach from any quarter, landward or seaward, mas-
sive, isolated, grand, like the Communion it represents.
It is the wonder of the Eastern Hill, whose summit it
crowns. With the completion of the two front spires,
each 200 ft., and the central spire, 350 ft., an approaching
traveller will feel something of the glow of Chaucer’s pil
grims when they sighted the Angel Tower at Canterbury.
Crotty made a determined effort to tear the three spires
out of the North Lyell mine. He left Archbishop Carr
£lO,OOO for their erection. Then there was a little
bobbery with the young widow, and the church is under-
stood to have given her something. Further, the £lO,OOO
did not by any means pan out into solid gold, silver, or
copper. The church doesn’t say what was the dividend,
but there is not a whisper of any of the three spires.
Cologne waited 400 years amid gibes for its spires, so
Melbourne has a margin of time.
Do not take a substitute for Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. It has no equal.*
There is a fiction to the effect that N.S.W.
State Parliament represents one vote one value.
At the recent elections Northumberland, with
12,256 electors on the roll, returned one member,
while Clyde, with 5303, did as much. Thus in
the latter electorate one vote had as much value as
votes in Northumberland. Middle Harbor had
12,038 voters on the roll, or more than Monaro
and the Darling put together. The Murrumbidgee
Laborite M‘Garry represents over 10,000 electors ;
while the man from Wynyard stands for a little
over 6000, and there are others.
The result of the appeal to the N.S.W.
constituencies should kill quite dead the ‘ ‘ apathy ”
cry of the daily press and of people like Deformer
Stinson. The result of the last Federal election
in Ma State was due—so said the Telegraph,
Geo. Reid, Geo. Pile, Cook, Carruthers, Hogue,
and “Pro Bono Publico” —to the “apathy” of
the people. About 50 per cent, voted, and the
Anti-Sosh crowd was unanimous in claiming the
other 50 as its rabid supporters who were too
dead or too tired to go to the poll. The apathy
of this enthusiastic and absent 50 per cent, sat on
Anti-Sosh’s chest like a toad. This time all
concerned banged the drum with such effect into
the apathetic ear of the elector that 65 per cent,
of him woke up and recorded his vote. The
records were topped by Leichhardt (78 per cent.),
Burrangong (77)' and Balmain (76), and the
awakened elector in each case rejected the Govern-
ment nominee. Taking the results all round, it
seems that the Tory party would have been wiser
if it hadn’t roused the elector quite so hard.
It has just occurred (at rather a late hour)
to the Australian Postmaster-General that tele-
graph insulators can be made in Australia. The
trouble has been this : England wears a white
insulator on its telegraph pole, and, through
much importation, Australia has got into the
habit of believing that its insulator must be of the
hue of a corpse. So far, it would seem, clay of
the required quality, and of the same glaring
snowball tint, hasn’t been found—or, at least;
hasn’t been worked —in Australia, but a reddish
insulator, which looks well against a background
of foliage, can be made here, and it is as good, and
as cheap, as the old anaemic English article. Now
it has just dawned on P.M.G. Mauger that the
pallid imported glare isn’t really essential in an
insulator, and he thinks of “ doing something.”
The increase of Federal Parliamentary
salaries set someone sounding Bent as to follow-
ing suit; but that astute person, recognising that
the Commonwealth Parliament is one thing and
the State vestry is another, wasn’t taking anyi
rise at present. No sooner, however, had Thomas
said “No” than it was urged that anyhow the'
House of Fat ought to be “recompensed.”
Friends of Fat said “ Hear, hear ” enthusiasti-
cally—and then there was a sudden silence. They
realised that that gun might be loaded. Some
wretched Lean person might even become a mem-
ber if there was payment. Still there isn’t
much risk, with the franchise as it is, and the
member’s qualifications as they are. The Fats
were paid £3OO a year from 1870 to 1880, and it
didn’t make any difference worth noting.

WHAT AUSTRALIANS CAN DO.
PIANOS AND HIGH PROTECTION!
IT is claimed by the importers of foreign pianos that the piano lias “ evolved,” that it took generations for the leading makers of the world to attain to their
present high standard of excellence, and that, therefore, Australia, being a “young country,” and without experience, pianos cannot be made here
equal to the foreign article.
Whether this is true or not may be judged from the following facts We started piano-making in Australia with a full knowledge of piano-manufac-
ture as piactised by the oldest and best makers in Europe and America; and because we found, after having imported and sold nearly 12,000 forebni pianos,
that instruments made in the cold climates of the older countries would not stand the severe and extremely diverse climates of Australia, we set ourselves to
make an instrument that would stand the climate ; and in the course of doing so we have invented the only practical and successful metal-tun in" system in
the world (foreign piano-makers for generations felt the necessity of a metal-tuning system to form part of the usual iron frame—vide Edmir Brinsmead
History of the Pianoforte, and Julius Bluthner, “ Pianoforte Construction” ; although many attempts were made to solve the problem, none was successful) ;
and we have devised a unique system of building up the cabinet work in cross-plies, so as to prevent warping or cracking ; we have originated a system whereby the
sounding-boards of our pianos are rendered imperishable in the most severe climates; and in many minor details of construction we have improved on the prac-
tice of the old-world manufacturers. The desired result has been attained—our pianos will withstand any climate, with no possibility of the wrest-plank living
way, and without warping or cracking of the cabinet-work, and without injury to the sounding-board. Further, the musical quality of the Beale Australian
1 ianos has been biought to a state of perfection that is, in the words of Herr Karl Studemund, of Musgrove’s Royal Grand Opera Company “simply
astonishing.” J 1 J
Moie than this.. The practice of even the best piano-makers in Europe and America is to buy parts from special suppliers, and these parts are then
assembled in < heir factories. But we have made it our aim to perform every detail ourselves, so as to gain complete control throughout, and thus be certain
of the highest quality. There is not a single detail of the Beale Australian Pianos that is not made and finished throughout with the most painstaking care.
We make the whole of the Cabinet work, every detail of it, in our own factories in Australia.
We make the whole of the iron frame, and all other iron Castings, in our own factories in Australia.
AVe make the whole of the sounding boards, warranted imperishable and unaffected by any climate, in our own factories in Australia.
We make all the bronze, glinmetal, brass, and aluminium castings in our own factories in Australia.
We make all the SCrew-StudS, action-bolts, and nuts, in our own factories in Australia.
We make all the sconces (candelabra), handies, pedals, and escutcheons in our own factories in Australia.
We even make all the castors in our own factories in Australia.
We make the most important and difficult parts of the action in our own factories in Australia.
We make our own carvings in our own factories in Australia.
The frames were designed, patented, and are made by us in our own factories in Australia,
The tuning-system was invented by us in Australia, and patented throughout the world.
The hitch-pins are all cast in the iron frame, our patented Australian invention.
We make all our patent hexagonal baSS-StringS in our own factories in Australia.
The machines on which the patent hexagonal bass-strings are wound with copper wire were designed and made in our own factories in Australia.
The Wrest-pins were invented by, patented, and are all made by us in our own factories in Australia.
The automatic machines for turning, squaring, and drilling the patented wrest-pins were designed and made entirely in our own factories in Australia.
The pressure-bars were designed, and are made by us in our own factories in Australia.
The marquetry inlays are prepared by, and laid by us in our own factories in Australia.
The panels are an altogether new departure in cabinet-work, imperishable, invented, patented, and made by us in our own factories in Australia.
The traversing drilling machines, for'drilling 300 holes in each frame, were designed by us, and entirely made by us, in our own factories in Australia.
The automatic SCIOW-tapping chucks for these machines were invented by, and made by us in Australia,
fine veneer-preSSOS and other apparatus were made by us in our own factories in Australia.
The iron and brass foundries are electrically furnished, and were installed on the most modern plan by ourselves in Australia.
Such energy, perseverance, and inventive skill would not be worth while were we not making an article of the highest possible grade. That the Beale
Australian Pianos arc of the highest grade, unequalled by any other pianos in the world, you can see for yourself by personal examination; and if you
require unbiassed, expert testimony, read the following :
Herr EMIL GREDER,
of the Royal Opera House of Berlin, Royal Opera House of Leipzig, Stage
Director of the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, Court Singer by appointment to
the German Emperor, the King of Wurtemburg, and the King of Saxony, Stage Manager
and Basso of Musgrove’s Grand Opera Company, wrote in our Visitors’ Book (Translation) :
“ The tour of inspection through this highly interesting piano-factory to-day was to me a
surprise as great as my satisfaction, inasmuch as the operations of the concern express in truth
and fact what I have myself proved in my own art, namely, that Australia has no need
to import goods that have been palmed off upon her by untruthful advertisements. The
reason is that she possesses the raw materials and the capacity to work them in such a dis-
tinguished degree as to be able victoriously to surpass such imports. I have not visited,
either in Germany or elsewhere, a piano factory so completely independent in all its
requirements. The product itself is excellent, and it is obvious to me that it would he hard
to surpass it by any imports, because it suits the exigencies of the climate. VIVAT,
CRESCAT, FLOREAT, AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY ! (May Australian industry live,
grow, and flourish).”
Herr RARE STUDEMUND,
tenor of the same company, wrote (Translation) : —“ Before I must depart
from the beautiful City of Sydney, I am constrained to express to you my best thanks for,
and my complete satisfaction with, the Beale-Vader Piano, which I have used for my
practice. I must confess that I did not think it possible that here in Australia, a com-
paratively new country, one would find in such a difficult branch of industry as that of piano
manufacture a concern of such eminence. According to my judgment, your instruments
very easily hold their own in competition with European pianos, if indeed they do Pot far
surpass them, for the splendid mechanism, and the warm, soft tone are simply astonishing.
In the hope that your factory may further- flourish and’ develop itself to the joy of your
fellow-citizens and to the glory of Australia, I subscribe myself, KARL STUDEMUND.”
Miss SARA ANDERSON,
soprano of Musgrove’s Royal Grand Opera Company, wrote on 15th July :—-
“ I wish to express to you my delight and pleasure in using one of your excellent instruments
during my sojourn in Sydney. Its beautiful singing tone makes it particularly suitable as ac-
companiment to the voice. I wish I might always have so splendid an instrument with me.’'
Herr FRITZ RUPP,
baritone, said he had intimate experimental knowledge of piano-manufacture
and of their construction, for his immediate relatives on both sides are owners of piano-
factories in Germany. He had never seen a concern so completely organised, and could not
have believed that any piano factory, no matter where it might be, could produce all the
detailed parts of the instruments in so many trades as he had actually inspected them at
Annandale. Therefore, he said, one can understand how the instruments are so absolutely
perfect in their several parts, seeing that everything is under control and specially designed to
suit. He tuned the piano to the pitch that he preferred, being a little lower than that at which
we issue them. The tone of the octaves of the human voice he considered to be extra-
ordinary, the resonance being softer and more sympathetic than he had ever before found,
which, as an expert, he proved to be due to the patent tuning system and the special con-
struction of the sounding-board.
All four of these artists were kind enough to visit us separately and entirely of their
own volition, each asking permission to view the works. Each had an imported piano in
use, but requested us to supply instruments upon hire. They put aside the imported pianos,
which, in three of the instances, were of the most eminent foreign makes.
Miss SARA ANDERSON was particularly gracious, kissed farewell with her hand
to the piano when it was removed, and, turning to a number, of her friends, said : “ That
is a sweet piano, and I only wish I could always have such to sing to ! ”
Herr STUDEMUND, when at the Factory, played melodies from several operas
to test the tone qualities, and was so enthusiastic in his satisfaction that he remained at the
instrument until, in spite of admonitions, he was late for rehearsal.
Higher testimony than this could not be had, and, in addition, we have the testimony of leading ladies and gentlemen in all walks of life, and we can <dve
over nine thousand references to buyers.

Australasian
Interstate Mail
Steamship Lines
HE elegant steamship
illustrated this week is
one of the magnificent
boats belonging to the
Howard Smith Company,
which runs regular ser-
vices from Geraldton in Westralia to far-
away Port Douglas, basking in the tropic sun-
shine of far Northern Queensland. This line is
called after its founder, that fine old pioneer of the
ocean ways, Captain William Howard Smith,
who arrived in Australia in the year of grace 1854,
as'master and part owner of the s.s. Express, with
which he traded between Melbourne and Geelong.
In 1862 he saw that the wild rush of gold-seekers had
made an opening for the enterprising, and purchased
the first intercolonial ship, the You Yangs, which
ran between Melbourne, Sydney, and Newcastle. It
paid. So the bluff old captain went right ahead at full
speed, buying new ships and opening up new lines, and
passing the fleet he had built up on to his family. In
May, 1901, the shipping business of William Howard
Smith & Sons Limited was floated into a public com-
pany under the name of Howard Smith Company
Limited. The family of the grand old pioneer showed
their confidence in the line by accepting the whole
purchase price in shares in the new concern, which
was floated into a public company for the sound busi-
ness reason that it had grown too big for a merely
family concern, and with the object of giving consti-
tuents and supporters an opportunity of acquiring an
interest in the concern they supported and did busi-
ness with. The flotation had the further advantage
of supplying more capital to buy the new steamers
necessary to meet the increase in the coastal trade.
The steamer shown above is the 4000-ton liner
Cooma, which, with the Bombala, also 4000
tons register, and the Peregrine, 3200, are the
crack boats of the company. The first two
are absolutely new and up to date, and the
Peregrine is practically so, having been
lengthened and renewed throughout.
There are 10 other
passenger steam-
ers, and 14 are
devoted to the
carriage of
cargo. of
which the
Century
and Aeon,
both 7250
register,
and Pe-
riod (5000)
are quite new and as up to date as anything on
the sea. But the whole of the cargo steamers are
large and well adapted to their work. Hitherto, owing
to political divisions and hostile tariffs, the inter-State
trade of Australia has not grown as rapidly as it should
have done under happier conditions, but with the
corning of the Commonwealth, and absolute fieetrade
between all parts of the Continent, this coastal trade
will increase rapidly, and is already doing so. Ihe
Continent has already, in proportion to population,
the finest coastal marine in the world, but under new
conditions the rate of progress will be accelerated
very rapidly, indeed, and the Five Companies that
have done so well in the face of past difficulties can be
relied upon to take the tide on the flood, grip Time by
the forelock, and meet opportunity more than half
way.
It is not usually known, but nevertheless true,
that some of the steamers belonging to the Five
Companies are as fast as they make them in a general
way. One of the finest sights this writer has looked
on, and in the course of a varied life he has seen some
good things, was an ocean race past Little Bay,
N.S.W. Two gigantic oversea liners were rushing
through the water and the sunrise at a great speed,
shearing through the rolling swell, and sending up
tremendous clouds of spray. Closer in shore, riding the
rollers like some splendid seabird, was the (compara-
tively) little Peregrine. She had cut down one great
liner, and was in full pursuit of the other, and rapidly
overhauling it. It only lasted about two minutes, and
then they swept out of sight away round a rocky
headland. Later on we heard that the Australian
liner had beaten both of them, and reached the
Heads with a lot in hand. If ever Australia has to
fight for her existence, there will be some stirring
deeds done by some of these fast coastal liners, after
the awnings have been removed and gun platforms
laid down where nowadays the passengers lounge in
the shade, and tell weird stories of people they once
used to know.
As Omar Khayyam said, “ The Spring is in the
land ” ; and in all this world there is no more beautiful
and wondrous place in Spring-time than Northern
Queensland. The steamers of the Five Companies
leave Melbourne and Sydney every week for the
northern State. The Howard Smith boats leave the
southern capital every Wednesday, and Sydney every
Saturday. Passengers may make the round trip
from Melbourne, via Sydney, Brisbane, Keppel Bay
(Rockhampton), Mackay to Townsville, and back
without leaving the Cooma, Bombala, or Peregrine,
whatever steamer they are on, or they may break
their voyage at any of these places, provided the
journey is finished within six months. For instance,
the round trip from Melbourne to Townsville, and
back, can be completed in 19 days by steamer through-
out, and at a cost of £16 Saloon. Which covers the
best of accommodation, the choicest of food, and the
enjoyment of all that science and good management
can do to make sea-travelling safe and comfortable.
Compared to this the ordinary Saturday-till-Monday
excursion to a country resort is wild extravagance,
without supplying an iota of the interesting informa-
tion and genuine pleasure.
•
To the man who was born with the foam of the sea
in his veins, and the singing of the surf in his ears,
the small ship appeals most. To that man there is no
more pleasant trip on this lovely earth than that he
can take by leaving the big liner at Townsville, and
travelling, in the “Lass o’ Gowrie, 1 ' past Lucinda
Point, Dunk Island, Clump Point, Cairns, Port
Douglas, and Cowley. In the smooth water between
the mainland and the coral island barrier, that keeps
the storms of the Pacific afar off, he will
see some of the most magnificent scenery in
the world, as island after island rises like
a picture from the expanse of blue sunlit
water, and finally dies down in haze and shadow in
the wake. It is like a pige from romance, and
standing on the deck of the comfortable steamer,
going forth to discover his own land, the Austra-
lian tourist can feel something of the same
delight that thrilled the ancient Dago mariners
who had crept round the Cape of
Storms, and found themselves, -
after evading incredible dangers,
among the million isles of
the wonderful East Indian
archipelago. The only
thing he will
lack will be
the sense of
danger escaped
and the hard
tack. On the
ships of the
Five Companies
there are no
dangers, and the
food is Austra-
lia’s best.


Painful Swellings Formed in Arm-

CUTICURA REMEDIES
ENTIRELY CURED HIM
**l had been troubled with swellings
under the armpits and on the small of
the back accompanied by a burning
itch to such an extent that I got very
little rest, day or night. This had been
going on for six weeks or more and I
had tried various soothing ointments,
these, however, gave only temporary
relief, and as I was getting run down
from the want of rest, I decided to con-
sult a doctor, but on noticing the Cuti-
cura Remedies advertised in the paper,
I thought I would give them a trial.
.1 used Cuticura Soap first, but this did
not give the desired relief, then I tried
Cuticura Soap, Cuticura Ointment, and
Cuticura Resolvent Pills for three suc-
cessive times. I am thankful to say
that, though my trouble was painful
and severe, my cure was complete
within a month, and I in the future
shall urge any one whom I come across
afflicted with skin troubles to use Cuti-
cura Remedies, knowing as I do the
great good they have done me. lam

Dear Bulletin. — Went this morning to my
tailor to order the annual suit, and selected what I con-
sidered to be the best material in the shop. I had braced
myself up to resist extortion levied in the name of the
Tariff ; but as I usually pay £5 ss. or £5 10s. for a sac
suit, it somewhat astonished me when the tradesman
quoted £4 15s. On inquiring the reason of such low
prices, I was informed that the material I had ordered
was Australian tweed. I ventured to suggest that
I had unwittij*glj' selected an inferior article. “Oh,
no,” was the response, “ it’s all wool.” “ How
does the new tariff affect your prices?” I queried.
“ Suits made of imported material are ss. or 7s. Od.
dearer now,” he said, “ but the Australian article
has not been affected.” “Will the Australian manufac-
turers take advantage of the tariff and raise the prices ? ”
I next inquired. “No,” was the reply; “we have re-
ceived a circular from the mills only this morning stating
that there will be no advance in prices. We’ve just begun
to push the Australian stuff since the other’s gone up.”
I left, buried in a deep think.—Warrumbucca.

More of the tricky ways of the Monkey-man !
Japanese boots, made in Yokohama and branded with the
name of an American company and the word “ America,”
are now being dumped into the Malay States and the
Philippines—and probably into Australia as well. The
Australian bootmaker’s wages average about Is. an hour ;
the Jap’s, IJd. an hour. Even the alleged “ drastic
duty ” (vide Argus) of 25 per cent, has all its work cut
out for it when it has to struggle against that sort of
competitor.
* » * »
Grass seed is the latest illustration of the im-
porting disease. Paspalum, Rhodes grass, even the blue
grass of old Kentucky, and other foreign herbage, have
been so pushed by the big houses in the trade that the
native grasses have been quite overlooked. Some dairy-
men and pastoralists have a misguided impression that
Nature knows better than the Sydney importer what
grasses are best suited for the N.S.W. soil and climate ;
but lately certain of them, in pursuit of this idea; had to
send to Maoriland for seed of N.S.W. native grasses with
which to replenish their pastures. The Sydney merchants
didn’t stock the common Australian substance.
* * * *
“ F.C.”: Nearly fell into some more of the
great natural resources of this country the other day, in
the shape of a kaolin mine at Ringwood (Vic.). Most of
the mineral is exported to Germany, and then re-im-
ported in the shape of clay pipes, whitening, etc. Also
some of it comes back to us as the “loading” in silk.
These Foreign-traders won’t let Australia do even its own
adulteration—which is, perhaps, a desirable circum-
stance when you look at it sideways and endways and
upside-down.
* * « *
“ Intoni” : In B. 2l)/6/’07 “ 0.K.” has something
to say concerning Australian-made cigars. He, however,
overlooks the fact that the Excise regulations compel the
Australian manufacturer to brand each package of his
tobacco with a sort of vulgar fraction in a circle. The
numerator is the serial number of the factory, while the
denominator indicates the State in which the goods
have been made. Thus the discerning purchaser may
satisfy himself as to the origin of his particular weed. In
cigars the brand is usually found on the bottom of the
box, or at one front corner. If the cigar comes from
Victoria the brand will be larger than if it is a product of
the Ma State. Cigar labels—made in German} —printed
in close imitation of old-established Havana brands,
may be purchased without difficulty ; also the
German prints a colorable imitation of the
Associated Havana Cigar Manufactur rs’ guarantee
label, which often takes in even old hands. The casual
cigar smoker usually revels in a cigar labelled “ Roths-
child,” and fondly imagines that the legend indicates
quality. It doesn’t; it merely indicates shape. Have often
wondered, b} 7 the way, why Australians don’t kick about
the weight of tobacco plugs. For instance “ fours ” may go
4, 4 J or 5 to the lb. ; “ sevens ” may go 7,7 J or 8 to the lb. ;
“ pocket pieces,” 13 or 14 to the lb. Originally the sizes
and weights were all right, but as prices went up the
plugs were made smaller so as to equal the increase.
The smoker paid the same price as of yore—unless some-
one “ cut ” prices—and wondered how his supply ran out
so soon. The manufacturer seems to be getting a con-
science of late, for the other day I saw a box marked
“reputed fours.” Or perhaps it’s the Commerce Act
getting in its good work.

The ancient prospector is about the most opti-
mistic person on earth. If he wasn’t, he wouldn’t stick
to the game. He very rarely acquires riches, but he is
always going to. There are some of him on the outskirts
of the Broken Hill line of lode, scratching about wherever
a ridge of rock curves itself over a hill, or sitting on the
dump of a long-deserted claim waiting for a syndicate to
bite. Unfortunately for him, when the s} 7 ndicate does
bite, it generally makes off with the bait and leaves the
hook. It is a pretty hard job to make a hole in the
ground anywhere about Broken Hill without striking’
rock within a foot or two. But if an old prospector
| sinks a hole, and there happens to be a speck or two of
lead in the rock, he at once draws an imaginary line
from the hole to the Broken Hill Prop., and then sits
down and convinces himself that the B.H. Prop,
lode must come that way. After thousands had been
spent looking for the southern continuation of the
main lode along the White Leads flat, the old
prospector came along and picked up the scent
on the ridge which bounds the eastern side of the
flat. The small outcrop which runs along the crest
was followed up and traced to the corner of the Central
and Proprietary leases, and then a huge ore body was
placed (in imagination) beneath the ridge. Years ago a
little copper was found on the eastern side of the ridge,
but it wouldn’t pay to work ; and as for silver and lead,
indications found so far haven’t even been so good as
those on which the New White Leads, Rising Sun, and
the rest of the string of duffers stretching out from the
South Block’s boundary were started.

“ Blister Consider the art of a prescription.
Some ill-informed critics sneer at the “ dog-Latin ” which
the medical world uses, but from early times Latin has
been used to secure uniformity, and to prevent local
diction interfering with accurate dispensing. Take, for
instance, “digitalis,” which, if rendered in English,
would in one county be “foxglove” and in another
“ lady’s fingers,” and so on. Another reason why Latin,
dog or otherwise, is used by the medical profession is to
deceive patients for their own good. If a man
with a weak heart knew that he was being
dosed with nitro-glycerine, he might become mor-
bidly fearful of being blown to smithereens. But
when his doctor prescribes “tri. nitrin.” he doesn’t
know that he is liable to become explosive. Nitro-
glycerine is given every day to restore, or ensure,
regularity of circulation, an ordinary dose being a 100th
part of a grain. A full dose of a 50th part of a grain is
sometimes given. Never more. Chemists can, by
mixing a drug with another substance, say sugar,, select
a 150th part of a grain with tolerable accuracy. Opium
is generally rendered in a prescription as “ Opi,” and the
oi linary patient is none the wiser. Other alluring drugs
are treated the same way in a prescription. On the other
hand, medical men know the value of impressing patients
with names. “Wind on the stomach” is not nearly so
convincing as “flatulent distension of the abdomen,” and
“ borborygm ” (which is just the same complaint) is still
better, because it thrills more. “ Borborygm ” has been
responsible for many a fat fee, but “ wind on the
stomach,” besides being indelicate, is a vulgar complaint
curable with a pinch of carbonate of soda.

" Agricola ”: Can anyone tell me of anything
cheaper than ordinary bottle-glass and plain jam-tin. I
am induced to these remarks by the disproportion be-
tween the glass of the grocery bottle and the hollow at
the bottom thereof. Also, by the size of the grocery tin,
and the shortage of the contents therein. A few weeks
back, I purchased from our local Sand and Sugar a bottle
of bike oil. To my delight, I got one twice the size of my
ordinary purchase, while the price grew not at all. Ar-
riving home, I emptied the oil into the old bottle, so that
I might gloat over the difference. I didn’t gloat. It
was the wrong difference. I had hardly started pouring
out of the new large bottle before I finished, and the old
small bottle was only three parts full. The bloated
stranger was adulterated with hollow bottom and air.
Same day I got a noble tin of pepper. It was of abnormal
dimensions, and raised high the hopes of fair men and
brave women as they beheld it. On opening it the pepper
was found to end three inches from the top. That tin
was adulterated with air and blank space, and there was
ozone in it. Even if that three inches of tin were for ad-
vertising purposes, tin must be dead cheap. Ditto bottle,
glass.

Good Health
is yours if you will exercise
your bowels with Reuter’s
Little Pi'ls. Remember they
are very different from all so-
called “laxatives.” They do
not blast out the bowel duct
the same as jalap, salts, sed-
litz powders, and the old fash-
ion pill, instead they are
a bowel tonic that gently
stimulates the intestines to
normal action so that they
supply the precious digestive
juices which are so necessary
to Good Health.

Rupture. Write for full particulars and copies of testimonials.
UNSTRUNG NERVES!
The cure of nervous ailments and weaknesses by electricity properly applied is not a long process.
Strength and vigor begin to return on the first application. The nerve-force, energy and ambition of a man
are really electricity ; when he lacks it and is sick and weak he cannot
be strong again until his supply of natural electricity is replenished.
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
for they only irritate and unnaturally stimulate the jaded nerves like
the lash stimulates the tired horse. . . • Electricity is the life and
strength of the nerves. The moment it is applied with the improved
Dp McLaughlin Electric Belt new life is given to every
nerve, organ, muscle and fibre of your body. The nerves act as con-
ducting wires and carry the life-giving current to every part of the body.
If you are weak, sick, unnerved ; if you suffer from Varicocele,
Loss of Vitality, Stomach, Liver, Kidney or Bladder
Trouble, Backache, Rheumatism or Sciatica, give up
physic and use the life-giving, strengthening and healing forces of
electricity. Our belt is simple and easy to use, no sting, burn
or shock. It works while you sleep. It is warranted to
give a strong current, instantly felt, and has special attach-
ments for men and women. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove that it is all we claim for it.
. It is a positive cure for all Weaknesses, and when used with
our newly-patented electro-plastic truss, is a certain cure for
Rupture. Put it on when you go to bed and you get up in the
mnrnint. feeline like a two-year-old colt. They are guaranteed to give a strong current, instantly felt.
They are within the reach of all; price £1 and up. Beware of cheap imitations.

A letter from Murrumbeena (Vic.) :
Dear Bulletin. —At such a time as this, when Australia
needs its own people’s testimony, I beg- to offer my thanks
to Tub Bulletin scribe who, some months ago, drew
attention to the Ballarat Stout. Was in the habit of
getting the imported stuff for tny wife, who is recovering
from an illness. Have been buying Ballarat Stout for
the last three months now, and my wife is positive that it
is superior to the imported. And in addition it is 50 per
cent, cheaper.—Yours faithfully, J. A. Davidson.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which iead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures"the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

An Enfeebled System
Thoroughly Restored.
A TRIUMPH IN ULTIMO.
THE CASE OF MR. A. WALKER.
By a Special Reporter.
In all matters affecting the well-being of the com-
munity, it is our duty to exercise every effort and influ-
ence in the direction of promoting a still happier state of
things, and if we only utilise the chances that offer of
helping our fellowmen, we shall do much to brighten the
hearth of many a home. In this direction such assist-
ance as* that given by Mr. Alfred Walker, of No. 68
Macarthur-street, Ultimo, is most valuable, for it deals
with a subject which claims the attention of everybody.
Answering a reporter, Mr. Walker said: “About six
ypars ago I had very bad luck indeed, which was brought
abfeut in this way. My work had taken me to a place
situated between Douglas Park and Picton, where i had
an engine and boiler to repair. In putting these things
to rights I put my health all wrong, for whilst I was on
that work I lived in a tent, and caught a severe cold,
which went right through me. For two or three months
I could not get rid of it, and in the meantime the cause
of much suffering had been taking root, for Rheumatism
attacked me so badly that my legs, arms, and shoulders
were almost useless to me. And the pain ! I can’t find
words to describe it. My neck, too, was so stiff and sore
that I could hardlv move it, and by degrees I got so in-
firm and helpless that I had to lie up altogether for
several weeks.’!
“ Which would mean considerable financial loss to
you ?” , . .
“My word it did. But that was nothing compared
to the misery I was in. My right shoulder got worse and
worse, and my sleep became scarcer than ever. I had
become so cross and restless that I could not settle
myself down to sleep at all satisfactorily until about
midnight. Then I would sleep and dream till 2 or 3
o’clock, wake up suddenly, and then there was no more
rest for me till the next night. But these were not
my only trials. There was one very important drawback,
which was that I could not relish any kind of food, owing
to my appetite having left me in the lurch long ago.
When I ate it was more by force of will than anything
else —a determination to keep up my strength as well as
possible under adverse circumstances ; but there was a
stronger element than my own will at work, and so my
strength dwindled away in spite of me. The internal de-
rangements that had got hold of me were having a detri-
mental influence in every conceivable way. My eyes felt
twice their proper size, and my sight got bad, for when I
started to read I’d soon have to give up, all the print
seeming to run together, and nearly every day of my life
I was persecuted with the most violent headaches. Oh,
it was an existence deserving of compassion, and I pray
to God I’ll never experience the like again. It was
strange how giddy I used to get, too—sometimes so
severely that I felt quite sick ; but at that time I was an
awfully bilious subject, and it took nothing to upset me.
I would only require to take two or three mouthfuls of
food, when a feeling came to the stomach as if churning
was going on. The chest also had a stifling feeling about
it, which made me short-winded, while about the back,
iust across the lower part, the aches were something
dreadful. It would he almost impossible to endure all
this without the nerves giving way, and I assure you
mine broke down with a vengeance. .
“ In point of fact, I was a complete wreck at the time
a friend of mine advised me to give Clements Tonic a
“When Clements Tonic had had a fair chance, I ex-
perienced benefits in many directions; but what I was
particularly thankful for at the time was a distinct
falling-off in the rheumatic tortures that all other medi-
cines had been incapable of touching. It was Mar-
vellous. Naturally, I was encouraged to pursue this
latest treatment of mine, and by and bye I could
hardly restrain myself with the joy I felt at the
progress made. I soon started taking my food as
eagerly as if nothing had ever been the matter with
me, and in due time, to my surprise, I found that my
internal organs were actually performing their pioper
work again, which meant that I gained entire freedom
from the old tortures of indigestion, and began put-
ting on flesh again. It was a new thing for me to
retire to rest at night, and not wake up again till morn-
ing, and that’s what I have to thank Clements Tonic for.
It was also new to rise from bed with a clean tongue in
place of the fur which had formerly covered it, and no
violent headache to distress me, and no giddy turns
during the day ; and I assure you I often thanked God
that at last I had got a remedy which could restore vigor
to my enfeebled system, and steadiness and strength to

“ D.” (from London) : Hundreds of
Britain’s stoke-hole and gunboat men are physi-
cal wrecks at 30. The old time bull-necked tar
has given place to a stunted, cigarette-smoking
boy-man. At Chatham and other big naval
yards one sees crowds of nerve-wrecked sub-
marine men loafing around the sick bays and
hospitals. The Japanese warships Sukuba and
Chitose, visiting Portsmouth July 12 arranged a
tug-of-war with the men of the H.JVI.fo. Excellent
at Whale Island-50 a side. It was the most
humiliating exhibition ever seen in an Itnghsh
dockyard. At the word “go” the Japs hauled
and dragged the white-faced tars the whole
length of the drill-ground. The item was recorded
in two London papers only. At present the
Monkey is strolling around historic Portsmouth
saying that he could have cleaned tne skyline
with Bull if someone hadn’t rung a bell.
The latest official creation in N.S.W. is
called the Sludge Abatement Board. It is estab-
lished under the new Mining Act. Three high
Government officials have been appointed to abate
sludge, and they intend to make sludge sit up.
“ Garryowen ” (Vic.) writes :
Appearance of the revised Australian tariff brings into
pathetic relief the barrenness of the foreign-import band
hereabouts. , ■ .
Of all the devoted band that once made up the great
Vic. Freetrade party, and was wont to gather at Spencer-
street station to cheer the portly Greid when starting
on one of his oratorical peregrinations, how few are left.
Iceberg Irvine is a sort of Protectionist now. Ashworth
has his hands full managing two highly protected and
prosperous industries. Weir and Renwick are also
missing. Also the mighty Renwick press, that vast
printing concern which was to disseminate Freetrade
literature throughout Australia for all time, is now mainly
employed printing the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic
News! .
There is but one ray of light in the udiole business.
A sporting draper has made a round cash offer to the
disconsolate Freetrade rump of his State, so that it may
once more raise the banner of free imports on high he
being incensed, so rumor hath it, at the duty of 40 per
cent, on patent bosoms and other necessary items in the
wardrobe of the up-to-date Miss, who can’t get married
and have a real bosom of her own.
To lose allies like Irvine, Ashworth and Renwick, and
gain in exbhange one vendor of patent bosoms is indeed
hard, and Greid’s pint of bitterness may now be con-
sidered filled.


Headache, Indigestion and
Constipation.
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, has been discovered, which is
now completely curing each of tile
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in affording quick relief. You
do not require to go on takiag them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a dose of Frootoids when ill and
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective.
O Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient, but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that this should be borne in
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and. quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and iil
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
i eople should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses with each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frootoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose of Frootoids, instead of an or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the pa-
tient will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so becom& quite
independent of the necessity of taking
any aperient medicine.
Frootoids are only now being placed ,
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in getting them from your local c’ffi-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price
1/6, to W. G. Hearne, Chemist, GeS

. E. W. O’Sullivan’s new land policy for
N.S.W. is, with the exception of poultry and eggs
and the size of the selections, very much like that
propounded by Captain Phillip, Botany Bay’s first
Governor; The captain limited the area to GO
acres, but looked after the selector as minutely as
Mr. O’Sullivan hopes to do. After recounting
many indulgences which the venturous husband-
man was to receive, he specified that the lone
grain-grower was also to be supplied, free of charge,
with such “ poultry and eggs as the settlement
can afford.” But the indulgences did not run to
rum, and, though many took up land, most sold
out after a time to the military traders who had
annexed all the rum.
It is marvellous that the “ poor widow”
hasn’t been even mentioned in the matter of
the promised partial abolishment of the
N.S.W. income-tax. The tax on incomes derived
from personal exertion is to be abolished, so that
Pilcher, K.C., the Chief Justice and the pro-
prietors of the S.M. Hekald will pay nothing at
all on their huge earnings. But the widow who
is left with investments that bring her in £4 a
week will pay. Dr. MacLaurin, M.L.C., used to
go strong about the poor widow as an argument
against a land-tax. Now his own earnings are to
be freed from taxation, while the widow with
£4 a week will get no relief, and ne’er a word is
heard about the poor widow.

ALL THE WORLD KNOWS
THAT
Biliousness is due to a disordered state of the liver and can
only be cured by restoring that organ to natural healthy
action. This MOTHER SEIGEL S SYRUP does, promptly and
thoroughly because it acts directly on the liver, stomach
and bowels. That is why it always cures, not only biliousness,
but indigestion and constipation as well. Why not give this
great medicine a fair trial? You will not be disappointed.

The Happy Valley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a valley ringed about with falling
Cataracts, and murmurous with sounds
Of whispering echoes coming and going
and calling
About the grim-faced cliff-sides suddenly walling
With chasm and parapet the valley’s bounds.
Within the valley music and all sweetness
Wander in hurrying, glorious incompleteness,
And hope and love and faith have passion’s
fleetness,
And far away Death stalks his awful rounds.
Over the valley all men labor madly
Or blindly, and the Grim One goes-his way
Silently calling, and they hear him gladly,
Deep-clogged with earth, or having seen too sadly
What they within the vale will know some
day;
And back they turn with eyes of shame and
sorrow,
Sick for the far-off vale, that yef would borrow
Their own poor vision, and builds a fine To-
morrow
Of sunbeams on the cliffs, as once did they.
But they within the, valley wander dreaming,
Building their bright To-morrovys’ sunbeamed
halls,
Or playing with the echoes and in the streaming
Water of life that bubbles swift and gleaming
IJp from the unknown earth through creviced
walls.
And those that shines the brightest with its glis-
tening,
Marked from the others with an unseen chris-
tening,
Wander alone and lonely, ever listening
To the magic of the riiusic of the falls.
And one there is rolls .solemn, smooth and stately,
Clear as the air, into a quiet lake,
Wherein old images lean down sedately,
Rippled with fancy’s breath, .and gleaming
greatly '.l X.t , : !
Over a visible depth ; and one doth shake
'ln a passionate proud defiance, thundef-stream-
ing,
The sounding gulf; and one, a belt of gleaming
And rainbow-haunted crystal, wild with dream-
ing,
Falls vain and cloud-like on.-tho rocks to break.
And one is mingled all of curious voices
Of faith and hate' and- two streams
met
and turbid, in a,medley of. noises ;
)But a glorious Call that all the heart rejoices ,
■ Rings out from m&iifold cataract,yet.
. And orte there was, O'spirit of ‘young ■
Rich- with the glory of youth and fco ° 4^ on iSacfe,
ness, -A'
In mid course broke, 'to fill the winds with
madness
i And rich sad echoes men shall not forget.
And one, a solemn volume of stern thunder,
Streams forth in a majestic monotone
’Twixt earth and heaven; and the echoes roll
thereunder
Anthems of angels, and fixed rocks in sunder
Dissolve at that enormous thunder-tone.
And one, the mightiest of the waters, falling
From the mightiest of the mountains, all-appall-
ing (A.-, f.\ \
With its sheer depth, or sweet and placid
calling, ■ ■
Renders to each a secret of his own.
Thou lovely valley, there’s no more returning
Unto thy shady greenness mixed with flowers.
Swift must our passage be, and few discerning
Of all the sweets it offers, and the burning
Of that great glare that on the cliff-tops glowers,
Affecting us with sight too keen, or dulness
Like the gray, heavy desert,, till the coolness
Of still-uncertain Death, with all his fulness
Of ending and release, drowns; withered hours.
Thou happy valley ! Even now the ending
Of my short passage glooms across my path,
And I look back, and find the spirit lending
Its glory to the way I have been Wending
Was a blind Hope, that magic virtue, hath.
But now her eyes, unbandaged, see too surely
Within the nearing distance gleam obscurely
Mountains and clouds, and over them securely
Her star, nigh hidden in the morn’s red wrath.
N.S.W.
HARRY SULLIVAN.
The Jim-Jam.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE drunk balanced himself unsteadily
on one of Hogan’s best parlor chairs, and
Hogan permitted him to continue the
feat without reproof, thus demonstrating to those
who understood these matters that he was still a
person of comparative wealth.
He muttered disjointed sentences to the sur-
rounding furniture ; but the furniture appeared
not greatly interested. Away in the back of his
mind a great trouble eddied and spun like a
Bogan whirlwind.
In the middle of it were the hummers. There
was not a solitary beer-sparrer to help him dis-
sipate the cheque ; and he had been driven
(strongly against his principles) to shout for the
publican, in preference to drinking with the flies.
Hogan didn’t approve of beer-sparrers. When
they were about the cheque-person got too niuch
for his money. If he didn’t the hummers did
(they saw to that personally), and to Hogan the
net results were similar. '
From beneath the sofa the snake slithered
quietly across the linoleum.
The drunk regarded it with marked curiosity.
He was making abstruse mental calculations as
to how long he had been at Hogan’s.
“Far’sh I rec— (hie)— lelcsh,” he stated with
profound gravity, “on’y come ’ere yes’dee.
Nev’ r-rem’ber gerrin’ ’em s’— hie —quick. Mus’
be prerry goo’ stuff.”
The snake paused in the centre of the room.
The beady black eyes .gleamed wickedly, and the
small vicious head darted to and fro.
The drunk grinned. A new phase of the
question had dawned upon him.
“ Where’sh mates, ol’ man ?” he queried good-
naturedly. “ Don’ rec’leck sheein’ y’ by—hie—
’shelf ’fore.”
The snake resumed its interrupted journey to
the fireplace.
The drunk was obviously amused.
“Com’cal beggar,” he muttered. “No mates,
no nuthin’. Pore ol’ f’ler. Sorry f’r ’im {hie).
’S jus’ like me.”
Hogan entered, and the snake retreated to the
sheltering sofa.
“Who th’ divil arr oo’ shpakin’ to, annyhow?”
Hogan’s grim tone bespoke dark suspicions of
possible hummers.
The beery individual smiled affably.
“ Fren’ o’ mine,” he replied, airily. “ Ol’ fren
o’ mine. Goo’ stuff that, Mis’ ’Ogan. Nev’
shee ’em s’ qui— (hie)— k ’fore.”
“ Sde phwat ? ” Hogan disliked mysteries.
“ Zhim (hie) zhim-zhams.” The beer was
making him sleepy. “On’y one, though, Mis’
’Ogan. Gen’ly shee ’ole lot; Bringsh mates
smorrer p’raps (hie). Eh, ’Ogan, ole f’ler ?”
Hogan eyed him with disdain.
“Ye’re dhrunk, mahn,” he said approaching
the derelict’s chair. “Come ahn, an Oi’ll
Howley St. Dinnis !! ” .
Hogan’s leap was magnificent-hot it was not
war. His concluding remark roused: his guest’s
muddled faculties.
“ Wars er marrer ? ” he demanded, crossly.
Then sighting the snake’s head as it darted from
beneath the sofa, he chuckled beerily.
Hogan roosted gracefully on the frail table. To
reach the door he must pass close to the enemy.
The cheque-person sought to calm him.
“ ’S ail right, ’Ogan, ole boy,” he announced
patronisingly. “Carn’ ’urt y’, y’ (hie) ole fool.
’S on’y maj’nashun, y* know.”
Hogan seemed doubtful about it. Leading off
with a spring that wrecked the table, and caused
him to alight horizontally, he vanished through
the door.
The drunk watched his departure without emo-
tion. He was too drowsy to laugh again.
“’Sorright, y’ ole fool,” he repeated. “Eren’
o’ mine. ’ Sorright .”
He shook his head solemnly in condemnation of
Hogan’s extraordinary behavior.
The snake made a fresh start to explore the
room,; but, retreated to the friendly sofa when
|logan returned with a varied assortment of
garden* tools and other assistants. Bill the groom
gripped'a long-handled shovel with the air of a
(Roman gladiator about to die, and stepped
pngeyly' unto the arena. The beer-chewer
slumbered with terrific energy. From beneath
the sofa about 18in. of snake rearguard was in
, evidence, ,
Bill jammed the shovel on to the visible portion
with fine, precision. _ I‘
, The snake seemed to realise instinctively that
something was resting upon him. Bill became
alarmed.
“Come on, some o’ yous blokes,” he shouted,
entreatingly. “If I lif’ th’ blanky shovel he'll
git away.”, %
The assistants poured into the room in a body.
Big Mick, a gentlpman of considerable avoirdupois,
landed neatly on the sleeper’s pet corn.
That person' arose without delay. Seeing Bill
in the immediate foreground, he smote him with
commendable promptitude, and Bill collapsed on
the shovel.
The shake’s rear-guard retired on the main
body. The attacking party retreated in disorder.
Only the. drunk remained.
Plainly,' he Was a much.-puzzled individual.
He had jobbed a cove. Certainly! But for
what? The question was too intricate for imme-
diate solution. Beside the snake-problem it sank
into insignificance.
“ Nev’ shee s’ many blokes (hie) like it before, - ’
he observed thoughtfully. “Only one shnaku
’tween lot.” He kicked the wrecked table
angrily, and subsided upon the sofa with decision.
“Norrer ’nuff shnake,”hhe said, sternly. “No’
near ’nuff. Haf shpeak ’Ogan ’bout it.”
“Come outer this, y’fool.” Bill grabbed the
inebriate in a vain endeavor to haul him from the
Presence.
The Elevated One objected strenuously, and a '
whirling scrap ensued. In the thick of it Bill
spotted the head of the serpent in close proximity
to his leg.
“I’m bit,” he yelled, breaking from his anta-
gonist, and making a bee line for the bar. Hogan’s
only bottle of genuine three-star stood in solitary
state on the top shelf. With masterly judgment
Bill selected it at a glance, and surrounded half
the contents as a kind of preliminary canter.
Hogan’s protests were overwhelmed by the
chorus of advisers; but Bill wasn’t taking any
advice just then. He reckoned he knew exactly
how to deal with snake-bite.
The disappointed amateur surgeons, who had
wanted to cut up Bill, returned to the parlor,
where the Dissolute One awaited them.
“Look ’ere,” he spluttered. “Y’ all mad.
Znosh no snake ’t all. On’y maj’nashun. I
showy’. Wa’sh me!’'
He grabbed clumsily at the injured snake,
writhing and twisting on the floor beside him, and
raised it aloft.
For an instant he stood, petrified with astonish-
ment. Then, with a blood-freezing yell, he
heaved it through the open window on to the
dusty road.
The onlookers rushed to the execution, leaving
the drunk to take care of himself.
He stood awhile, watching them strike wildly
at the swirling, wriggling thing on the roadway ;
then made his way unsteadily to the bar.
“Fus’ zhim-zham (hie) ev’ caught ’live,” he
soliloquised proudly. “ Mosh’str’or’n’ry.”
Big Mick strode in with the battered remnants.
“Yous blokes oughter kill snakes,” he said,
scornfully. “Frightened of a blanky carpet
snake ! ”
* * * *
The drunk collapsed on the bar-form, weeping
’bitterly. “Never shee s’ch luck,” he snivelled,
disconsolately. “Ma’e shure s’ruck ’tirely noo
kin’ zhim-zham (sniff). On’y blars’ed ole carpe’
snake. Rotten /” He banged the counter
peremptorily. ‘‘(Hie) ’Ogan!”
That wrathful-visaged person materialised.
“ Mine’sh blanky rum. Wass yours (hie). Bill?”
But Bill answered not. Coiled up on the bar
floor, the empty three-star bottle clasped lovingly
to his breast, he slumbered sweetly—the dream-
less sleep of the ineffably drunk.

CONSTIPATION
And Headache Cured. 1
No ailment leads to so much distress and so many different diseases of
the body as Constipation. It is a many-headed giant, and counts its victims
by tens-of-thousands. Constipation is the
reason why you wake up in the morning
with a bad headache, feeling as
heavy and weary as when you
went to bed. It is the reason
why you have no appetite and
no interest in life. You should
not on any account treat Con-
stipation as if it were a mere
accident—a temporary stoppage
of the digestive canal. Consti-
pation is really a symptom of
weakness in the digestive organs.
Bile Beans, a purely vege-
table tonic-laxative, are the
finest remedy for Constipation.
They act gently and persistently.
They do not force a passage
through the digestive canal, but
promote the flow of the natural
fluids by strengthening the
stomach, liver, and bowels, and
by so doing cure cases even of
the most advanced stage.

A Great Sufferer’s Gratitude.
, C ! ha J s - r^uc^er » Eaglehawk Road, Long Gully, Victoria, says :—“ Constipation and
headache had affected me for several years. They were brought on in the first place by my
neglect in responding to the regular calls of nature. I always felt listless and tired —had no
inclination for work, and suffered with splitting headaches. I tried all sorts of medicines,
but could not gam any permanent benefit. Happily, Bile Beans were brought to my notice
and 1 secured a supply. From the first dose I steadily improved, until at the present time I
am in perfect health, lam no longer troubled with constipation, the headaches have ceased
to be, and 1 now feel thoroughly fit for work.”
For indigestion, biliousness,
spring ailments, headache,
constipation, debility, female
weakness, bad blood, bad
breath, anaemia, and all liver
and stomach troubles, Bile
Beans are an unfailing cure.

Next Door.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
£N spite of much hair restorer, my appearance
is now too old for the ribbon department, so
I trudge the scorching streets in thin boots,
trying to wring orders for sewing machines from a
stony-hearted and reluctant public. Canvassing is
a heart-breaking job, and there are times when
bed and oblivion seem the only goal worth
striving for.
From morn till eve I have drifted from one
shabby doorstep to another, dully noting the
frayed oilcloths that covered them, bitterly resent-
ing the uncompromising attitude of the women
who interview me furtively from jealously-guarded
doorways.
All day has the north wind sported with me,
blinding my eyes, filling my ears, and bearing
away my hat.
Arrived home, my stomach stayed, it still wants
an hour to closing time ; but, in spite of my wife’s
protests, I slap up the refractory shutters, thus
hiding from the eye of an indifferent public the
“dummies,” “gift” crockery, and Japanese um-
brellas, which give to Sarah's tea emporium such
a convincing air.
“ What to turn my hand .to next, God knows,”
I remark dispiritedly, getting into my night gear,
ere sinking into the lethargic sleep of the dog-
tired. “ Nothing for it but to go on the land—’s
far as I can see—a few fowls perhaps —cow —pig
or two. Yes, yes, we’d have to borrow from your
father, of course. How you do harp on that
aspect of the case—go in for bee culture perhaps,'
or—whafis ’at ? Yes, goo’ ni’ ! ”
It must be io o’clock when the oyster saloon
next door, dead by day, wakes up for business.
The Italian’s cockney wife coruscates behind
the counter,- opening shell-fish and entertaining
the customers with jokes of an obscure meaning.
Back from sleep’s borderland we are hauled by
their ear-splitting appreciation of her wit as it
filters through the jerry-built wall to our unwilling
ears. Sometimes we partly catch the joke as
well, and, willy-nilly, we rack the tired brain for
its solution.
There is a sudden roar. We gather that the
fish has a “rush” on. There is a stampede of
heavy feet, a hideous scraping of wooden chairs
on tiled floors ; creaking doors open violently and
close with long-drawn wails.
Shrill orders for “glass aunersli-i-ce” pierce the
sub-din, and deep-throated replies reverberate
from the kitchen, where Guiseppe Tongoli, pro-
prietor, officiates at “de stofe.”
Italian Bettina, of the scowling visage and
copper-toed boots, thunders up and down the
passage which runs parallel with our bed. Her
progress is punctuated with collisions with herself,
the walls, anything, as she passes. Our pictures
vibrate dangerously. The lamp flickers sympa-
thetically.
On the doorstep a cat, lured by scents of fish,
meows maddeningly, and blending with all other
sounds, yet a thing apart, a family quarrel of un-
mistakable bitterness goes on for ever.
Reasoning with myself, I resolve not to hear
the din—to shut my eyes to it —to achieve a
triumph of mind over matter. Impossible feat.
Furiously I slap at the flies which, attracted by
the fish atmosphere, hover over us, and I wipe the
dew of exasperation from my brow.
The wife, ever tactless, seizes this moment to
tell me of the dog tax. It is due to-morrow.
It is too much. My back breaks under the
final straw. I bury my head in the pillow to
hide my emotions.
Presently the finances of the fish shop are
augmented by a party of bandsmen.
They are elated, and clamor for supper.
Guiseppe shuffles up the passage personally to
bid them welcome. The “ youch-youch ”of his
canvas slippers is easily heard, and the leathery
smile wreathing his features as easily imagined.
“ Ulloa ! ” says he, playfully; “ah, ah, you
knaw who gif de best meal for de money. Vull
an’ blenty ’ere, you sly dogs, ha ha !
' “What you ’ave?” he continues. “ Dere is
oyster on de shell, shtew oyster, fr-r-resh boil
lobster, Murry cot cudleds an’ cheeps. Hi,
Bettina, run for de gentlemen’s ale, an’ look-a
sha-arp ; queeck now, shif yourself. ”
While waiting the bandsmen blow—blow blood-
curdling blasts on the trombone, execute fan-
tasias on the drum, and go through exercises with
heel and toe.
There is comparative silence when. they are
served. If it were not for the audibleness of
their gobbling, one could sleep. Hope rises in-
fernal in the human breast. “ God is good,” we
murmur. “They may go away quietly. We
may get some sleep some time”
Hark ! What is this sudden uproar —this up-
setting of chairs and stamping of feet, this hideous
clamor ?
Bettina it’ is. She has caught a rat in the
bread crock. It is brought into the passage
alongside us, and the “suppers” are full of
childish ; glee. Bettina’s head is turned with
praise.
All hands —bandsmen, customers, casuals, pro-
prietors and the dog —join in the chase, armed
with sticks, chairs, ? anything portable, and take
active part in the rat’s long-drawn obsequies.
Heaven ! but this is too much. lam a man of
peace, but even I can be oppressed too far.
I tap (timjdly, it is true) upon the partition, and
proffer a polite request for peace. '
As well attempt to stem Niagara. A deafening
medley of voices answers me.
“Go it, Shorty,” I hear. “ Get a shot at him!
No —yes, the terrier’s got him. No, ’e ain’t !
There ’e goes. Sool ’im, Shorty—rats, r-r-rats !”
“There he goes —look out, Missus” (a loud
squeal). “ Heavings, he's makin’ fer me skirts.”
Bang, smack, crash. “Jump on ’im, Bettina—
not the dorg, yer fool.” “ O gosh, the beggar’s
bit me. I’m bleedin’ to death. I’ll pot him
fer it.”
“ Yes,” roars the excited voice of Guiseppe,
‘ * pud ’e’s pot on. Led de dam mongr-r-rel alone,
’e can catch de ver-r-rmin if you led heem mind
’e’s own beeziness.”
Thud, wallop ! A heavy body falls amid
brazen instruments. The Italian is pushed vio-
lently through the drum, and “ Shorty ” bolts to
the yard with the rat, now very dead.
The rest of the company are disentangled from
the wind instruments. The broken crockery is
collected. Then the boss remembers that two-
pence capitation, in the shape of rat fee, is now
disappearing into Shorty’s digestive apparatus.
“ Sacriste ! ” he groans, tearing his hair ; “de
dammable mongr-r-rel, he eat hart cash ! He
swallow dwo copper ! Eet is not right. Bet-
tina—missus—you'dam fool, why not keep de rat
till daylight, when you sell him to de gouncil for
dwopence ? Ah—sech a brain as I haf to deal
with, sech ;
Supper is resumed, likewise song and story.
Again I protest. This time I elicit a reply—an
insolent blast of massed instruments blown by the
collective lungs of the crowd. The cornetist in
particular is most painstaking in his efforts to
locate our ear-drums with the mouth of his instru-
ment.
Infuriate, I grope for my boot. I beat the wall
savagely till the plaster leaves it and buries my
better-half in ruins. I shout biting sarcasms, and
throw threats off my chest. My eyes flash fire—
this last effort is lost, unfortunately ! All to no
purpose. The raconteur of the company is telling
an after-dinner story, and the vials of my wrath
are wasted.
Their money spent, the proprietor firmly
empties the musicians out. Those who are able
to walk home, do so ; others hang over our side
gate to argue.
Then Nature, utterly exhausted, succumbs, and
we slumber.
At x o’clock precisely a husky voice at our open
bedroom window demands a lobster.
I ask myself, “Is this a nightmare ? ” But no !
The voice assures us of his ability to pay. He
chinks a coin or two as evidence, and loses one.
Then follows a protracted search by the aid of
matches, much time lost in drunken explanation
as to how the coin slipped through his fingers, a
bumping of heads upon our wall, and a flow of
language hot enough to scorch the paint. Finally,
they forgot what they were looking for.
Again our privacy is intruded upon.
“ What yer want ? ” I bark furiously.
“ Givsh a lobster, will yer, bosh? Me ’n me
matesh offen patronishe yer shop—if y’r a blanky
black man—’t’s bit pash closhing time, ish true,
but fach’s case ish ”
“My good man,” I answer with deadly
politeness, “ the fish is next door—you’ve mis-
taken the place. Next door, fish shop next ”
“ Thatsh aw’ me eye,” interjects the voice
thickly, “ thatsh an ole tale.”
A match is struck, disclosing a swaying figure
clutching by our window curtains. A bloated
countenance, surmounted by a gold-laced cap,
worn peak behind, is thrust through the open
window. My wife screams, and disappears under
the bed.
“No caush for fright ! ” remarks the intruder.
“ It’s all ri’ ; got shixpence to pay, bosh, givsh
lobster ’fore I stove in ther blanky winder—
shee ! ”
“Damn you!” I yell; “go next door—the
infernal fish shop’s next door.”
Springing from the bed I approach the window
sideways, and deftly remove the iron bar which
trigs it open.
Down comes the window with a run—crash !
Good, it’s got him.
Held fast, gasping horribly, he swears inarti-
culately. His cap falls into the wash-basin. He
kicks like a colt. His mate, too drunk to com-
prehend, complicates matters by tugging at his
heels.
I return to bed and throw water over the wife,
now in the first stage of hysterics. Every rooster
for miles around crows loudly, and every dog in
the neighborhood barks in chorus.
Then Constable Finnerty bears majestically
down upon us. He makes the drunks fast, then
flashes his bull’s-eye over us while he gathers the
heads of the affair:
“ D’yer whant me to arrist ’im fer threspass ? ”
he asks.
“No, no!” screams my wife. “We won’t
appear at court ! We’ve never been in trouble
before ! We couldn’t hold up our heads again !
My father’s a Methodist local preacher ! ”
“Well, will yez sign the char-rage sheet?”
says Finnerty, casually resting a size 14 foot on
his “ case,” and again bathing me in the lime-
light of his bull’s eye lantern as, like an unearthly
visitant in my robe of white, I hover uncertainly
in the shadow.
The wife tugs at my garment.
“Ah, no, Sergeant, no thank you,” I reply
nervously. “ I don’t wish to be hard on them—
a drop of drink, you understand. We’ll overlook
it.”
“ Roight ye ar-re ! ” he rejoins. “ Good
noight to yez. Come on, me bhoys, ’tis drunk
and disorderly yez are, an’ tearin’ me uniform—-
’tis no odds to me, annyway ! ”
And hauling away his sluggish burdens he
disappears.
At four o’clock a vehicle rattles up, and its
driver batters long and loud at Guiseppe’s door.
After a long interval the Italian calls :
“Whoeeseet?”
‘ * Eet is I, Antonia-h—eet is four o’clock. I
go to de markedt. Eef you haf your clothes on
you can ride in de cardt.”
“No’h, I haf not my clothes on ; I haf my
nighd-shird on,” replies Guiseppe; “ I gome
after wid de truck, si ! ”
“Si ! ” replies the driver, and the vehicle
rattles away.
“Goddam !” exclaims the Dago, “’ere is to-
morrer come alretty, and de lazy lubbers dey
sleep de brain away while I, Guiseppe, earn de
grub. Ged up, for the lofe of Heaven —ged up
and ’elp me bring in de truck.”
The truck he presently propels through the
house. We hear its first distant rumble in “de
yart.” “ Gurrr, gurrr-er ” —like a patrol it draws
nearer and louder. The truck is wide, the track
is narrow. Skilful engineering is needed, but the
Dago, not yet properly awake, is too excited to
pilot. He merely puts brute force into the job.
He carries all before him, and finally departs in
triumph with half a door entangled in his wheel.
We are comatose for two hours. Then comes
a tapping at our door. It is a customer. A
monotonous chant, with no punctuation in it,
assails our ears :
“ Please mother wants arf a pound o’ one-and-
three and don’t forget the coupon she’s got no
silver she’ll pay for it on Saterdee.”
WEROONA.

IN THE FUTURE
there may be many new diseases, doctors say; but it is certain that there will
be the old familiar maladies—what are sometimes called light ailments, but
which cause heavy discomfort and often real suffering, as those who’ are
bilious and depressed know only too well. It is equally certain that people,
who from stress of modern conditions, long hours,, hasty meals, and so on,’
get out of sorts and run down generally, will, in the future,
AS IN THE PAST
know exactly where to go for the safe and congenial remedy to make them
all right again. Few of us can do without occasional medicine, even the
healthiest , indeed, there is no way of keeping well except by assisting
, Nature now and then, and taking a medicine which all can resort to with
perfect confidence in its ability to do just what we require it to do. That
medicine is, of course, as everyone has known for 60 years and more,
BEECHAM’S
PILLS
the household remedy of two hemispheres. These pills have helped genera-
tions to a sound digestion and consequently to a cheerful outlook on Life.
That is what they are made for. Our grandfathers swore by them ; they

disturbed stomach, and they
