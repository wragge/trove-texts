Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION.—The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good” as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-

their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson’s

The Story of the Light Horse
Sinai and Palestine,- by H. S. Gulletl
(Angus and Robertson), is Vol. VII of the
Official History of Australia in the War
The big book will help the many who now
raise inquiring eyebrows at the mention o)
Romani or Gaza or Nar Anga to realise thal
the so-called “picnic campaign” of the Light
Horse and the Cameliers was a three-yeai
affair, waged over flaming deserts, on freez-
ing mountain ranges and in pest-ridden val-
leys, punctuated by fierce and bloody battles
in the open, where the grateful shelter o 1
ttench or dugout was much too often absent
It tells of plagues of flies, septic sores
malaria and pneumonic influenza, exacer-
bated by scanty food and vile water —all in
a land that was a cloud of dust in dry
weather and a filthy morass in wet. Here
one may read of amazing midnight battles
like Romani, where a thin string of the Ist
and 2nd Light Horse brigades, helped by
a handful of Maorilanders, held up the
advancing Turkish army in the darkness,
fighting, often hand to hand, and after a long
day’s struggle routed and pursued the enemy
for 12 houfs over the midsummer desert.
Here, too, are chronicles of long night rides,
followed by hard fighting in the grey and
hungry dawn, of waterless marches that
ended at Bir El Abd, Magdhaba or Rafa,
where the battle raged all through the day,
to cease in dramatic victory in the darkness,
amid throngs of weary prisoners, glad to
be “safely captured,” as one of them put it.
For the first time we have a complete account
of the first attack on Gaza. And we are told,
incidentally, of the comic seizure by Ryrie’s
men of the Turkish divisional commander,
with all his staff, as the latter were driving
comfortably to their H.Q. in gharries. And
then thpl’e is the stoi'y of the Third Brigade’s
galloping charge on the Turkish trenches.
That exploit, in which the Turkish flank
was turned, represented the critical point of
a critical -battle. After Beersheba, the road
jto Jerusalem and, later, to Damascus w'as
never again barred.
The success of the Light Horse may be
ascribed to three main factors. First, the
experience gained on Gallipoli in battle con-
ditions and fire discipline; second, the fact
that many of the older officers and men had
seen much mounted service in South Africa;
third, the grand quality of their horses,
largely .of blooded stock—and a long rest
in Egypt, which helped to acclimatise the
mounts and accustom them to hitherto un-
known grain foods, had much to do
with the success of the horses. The
Light Horsemen themselves, drawn largely
from inland Australia, were perhaps the
most casually competent devils who ever
slung a rifre. The camaraderie existing
between all ranks was remarkable. Absent
from conditions that in any way approxi-
mated to those of their native land, they
naturally turned for companionship and
friendship to one another. For these men
there was no English leave, no meeting with
one’s own folk away from war conditions.
Their rest camps were only so many tents
somewhere else in the wilderness, even
the undelectable Cairo being as far removed
as Bourke or Blackall or Darwin, or
wherever homesickness urged their thoughts.
Of the English and Indian cavalry who
shared the later fortunes of the Light Horse
and Ghmeliers, the historian says much that
need not he dwelt on here. Diplomatically
he makes it (dear-, however, that the Aus-
tralian and. Maoriland Light Horse, with
the Anzac camel regiments, were regarded,
event by Allenby, as the cream of his army.
“These Anzacs are the keystone of the
defence of Egypt,” wrote General Murray to
the War Office after Romani, and they main-
tained their prestige to the end.
J. B. HIGGINSON.
“Oiat H. S. Guile tt’s Sinai and Palestine
rims to 800 pages is due largely to the
•author’s kindly ambition to mention as many
aames as he can; and though there are times
when it is hard to see the wood of incident
for the trees of personalia, one result is
that we get a gallery of most interesting por-
trait studies.
In the beginning it looked as though the
Palestine campaign was to be sacrificed to
goad manners and the social touch, as the
Gallipoli adventure had been:
Sir Archibald Murray, who, on January 10, 1916,
took over the command of the Eastern Expeditionary
Force... .possessed weaknesses which marred his per-
formance as a leader, and were prejudicial to his
own personal interest... .He was too generous in his
attitude to the Western Front, too generous in his
obedience to the War Office, too generous in his con-
fidence in his chief subordinates. His generosity,
indeed, rather than his mistakes, was his undoing
in Egypt. ' _
Barely a month after the disaster to the sth
Mounted (Yeomanry) Brigade on the way
to Romani he is to be found thanking the
authorities in London for their request for
a division to be used in France, and men-
tioning that he would send the 11th —
“the best he had.” No soldiers could have
met’death more bravely than the men who
were overwhelmed at Oghratina and Katia,
but ene Of tile idiosyncrasies of the fashion-
able British fighting-man was to be revealed
in tfea course of this tragedy, and Gullett
notes that it estranged the Australians and
the English for over a year. Ryrie’s 2nd
Brigade marched to the relief of the Yeo-
manry, but found the 11. Q. at Romani aban-
doned:
The Eight Horsemen discovered in the officers’
mosses of that camp evidences of good living which
they deemed inconsistent with serious campaigning.
This led them to a foolish though natural action.
They had ridden out at very short notice without
full equipment, and on scanty rations. They had come
to succor the yeomanry; finding the yeomanry fled
tliay helped themselves to any foodstuffs and mili-
tary equipment which they could find in their camps.
It was the South African War and the
champagne-cases of Sir Redvers Buller and
hte staff over again: all Englishmen were
luxury-loving cocktails; all colonials boorish
tfciev eg. There is not the slightest doubt
that Murray, while appreciating the battle
qualities of the Anzacs, was as much dis-
gusted with them otherwise as any youthful
squire fresh from Eton and Sandhurst. His
method of rebuking them for their unsol-
dtei-ly conduct in camp was to deny them
the decorations they had earned by their
soldierly work in action.
Every ingenious device of the Australians
to cope with conditions which they under-
stood much better than the high command
were opposed, in the first instance, by staff-
officers, many of whom were fighting at the
time from the Savoy Hotel, Cairo. Mounted
drivers for G.S. waggons are quite- in place
for the purpose's of warfare on made roads,
but in Palestine the Australian and MX.
teamsters quickly recognised that the postil-
lion was a'needless handicap to impose on
a horse that could equally well be driven from
the vehicle. They asked Ordnance for reins,
were refused, and, to the stupefaction of the
authorities, improvised reins, and drove their
six-liorse teams as they had been accustomed
to do at home. In course of time the British
adopted this and a dozen other sensible, if
unconventional, methods themselves. At
about the same period the Anzacs realised
what splendid fellows the Tommies are, in
the mass, and the foundations weie laid of
a sentiment of friendship for them that had
its basis in respect.
Murray’s recall followed logically on the
Gaza failure, and the Anzacs were introduced
to a totally different type of G.O.C. in
Allenby.
“I could not count the times I have shaken hands
with Allenby,” said a Light Horse brigade-major a
few months after the new leader’s arrival. “Between
the Canal and Gaza I never set eyes on Murray.” By
such differences in personal bearing and policy have
many battles been won and lost. .. . Allenby’s tall
and massive but restlessly active _ figure, his keen
eyes and prominent, hooked nose, his terse and forc-
ible speech, and his imperious bearing, radiated an
impression of tremendous resolution, quick decision
and steely discipline. Troops who caught only one
fleeting glance of him felt that here at last was a
man with the natural qualities of a great driving
commander, who, given a great task, ana supplied, as
Allenby was, with a great scheme for its accom-
plishment, would relentlessly force it through to its
conclusion. At last they had a commander who
would live among them and lead them.
Bizarre and splendid figures are etched
with an artist’s care into, the brilliant pic-
ture —Granville Ityrie, with his complete
fearlessness, his comic songs and stories to
the troops, his determination to live as they
did, and his capacity at the age of 52 to
handle a rifle, ride or throw and doctor a
horse as well as any of them; Royston
(“then nearly GO years old and massively
built, but as insensible to fatigue as he
was utterly careless of danger”), who at
Romani would gallop up to parties of men
crouched low in the sand, with yards of
bloodstained bandage trailing behind him,
crying to the officers: “Keep moving, gentle-
men, keep moving,” and to the men, “Keep
your heads down, lads, stick to it, stick to
it. You are making history to-day”; Chau-
vel, “reserved and aloof in manner, gentle
of speech and quiet of bearing,” stern yet
just, indifferent to popularity, the possessor
of a cold, clear brain which saw not days
or weeks but months ahead.
In some respects Allenby understood the
Australians less than Murray; but he
learned, and his farewell order is as high a
tribute as any troops could have desired;—
I have found them [the Light Horse] eager in
advance and staunch in defence. At Beersheba, a
mounted charge by a Light Horse regiment, armed
only with rifles, swept across the Turkish trenches
and decided the day. On foot, too, they have
equally distinguished themselves as stubborn fighters.
They have shown in dismounted action the dash and
enterprise of the best type of mounted infantry. On
every variety of ground—mountain, plain, desert,
swamp or jungle—-the Australian Light Horseman
has proved himself equal to the best. He has
earned the gratitude of the Empire and the admira-
tion of the world.
Gullett has a clear and vivid style, and is
a master of portraiture.
JOHN POLDING.
Dream-stuff
In 1358 a very great but somewhat naughty
book was written by a poet named Giovanni
Boccaccio, who, though a poet, had a rather
low mind, as befitted an illegitimate son in
love with, and inspired by, an illegitimate
girl. Since the remarkable advertisement
given to ‘‘The Decameron” by the Customs,
half the young damsels on the trams are to
be seen surreptitiously reading it on their
way to and from work; the young men are,
of course, too busy with more serious things,
such as betting news, to bother about great
literature. In the story that follows imme-
diately after “Isabella and the Pot of Basil,”
which Keats has set to such yearning and
hungry poetry, as if his own young life were
striving to put its unhappy love-dreams into
words, Boccaccio has analysed the causes
of dreams and how far we are to believe in
them. He has done this with all that de-
lightful charm, that child-like ncuiveU of
the Renaissance, which has made the world
love him even though it has often had to
hold its nose as it reads. “The world,” I
say, excepting the Australian Customs De-
partment : that loves nothing. Ilis' explana-
tion of dreams is that they depend upon
whether your stomach is too full or too
empty; sometimes they are worth taking
notice of, but-more generally not.
This explanation was perfectly sufficient
to most sensible people until an Austrian
professor, one Freud, hit upon the happy
thought that dreams really show the uncon-
scious mind of the dreamer influenced by
suppressed sexual desires which Society will
not permit of realisation. These desires do
not show definitely as desires, but make
their presence, known by a world of symbols,
which can only be interpreted by a profes-
sional psycho-analyst, who seems to be able
to interpret them as he thinks fit. Thus,
if a woman should dream of a tree choked
by a creeper it is only a symbol of some-
thing else.; probably indecent. The psycho-
analyst will tell her like a shot whether it
means that she has eaten her babies or com-
mitted abortion or done something equally
disgusting, and take a fee for it; the telling
will cure her of a desire to get drunk or of
fits, according to which phenomenon may
happen to be the more profitable to the
High Priest who acts as interpreter. Few
doctors have taken to psycho-analysis,
though most of them thjnk there is some-
thing in Freud’s theories even if he has
driven the sex-obsession much faster than it
tias legs to carry it.
If a man be annoyed by a particular type
of dream about some female —to the honor
of the male sex this dream is seldom about

What th: Right Leather Belting Means
to Your Production Efficiency.
Engineers who have made a study of power transmission problems testify to
the difference in the efficiency of a plant that the right belting can make.
For instance, on a high-speed drive such as that illustrated, it is of the
greatest importance that the belt used should have the maximum of tough-
ness, flexibility and frictional grip.
That is the reason why
Chromol Leather Belting

any particular woman, but only about some
abstract female-Freud does not inquire
about the physiological condition of the
man’s bodily structures; lie takes him back
to the far-off days when he was an infant
uuliiig in his mother’s arms. If a woman
and her child love each other—as they gen-
erally do —your Freudist calls m the Uedi-
])us-complex” about a naughty old Gieek
king w ho murdered his father and married
his mother; this also accounts for incest,
which is known —by your Freudist to be
so common between mother and infant.
When you see a young mother hugging her
baby for sheer love and pride in it you must
not'think the sight beautiful; your Freudist
will tell you that she simply wants to com-
mit incest with it. Freud seems to explain
almost tlie whole of human conduct by
sexual desires repressed in early life.
The vast numbers of young ladies who
have embraced Freudism —perhaps because
they have nothing better to embrace —are
probably forced by society to repress their
natural feelings and find in Freudism those
delicious thrills which they could have found
much more artistically in Boccaccio if the
Customs Department had not set itself up as
arbiter Utterarum. (It would be interest-
ing to psycho-analyse the minds of those
Customs officials.) This extraordinary rush
of the young woman-novelists to Freudism
—unhappily the poor ladies do take it all
so seriously! Freud might be Aphra Behn
with her frank pornography—is one of the
most remarkable features about contem-
porary literature. Probably these young
ladies have flown to Freudism as an inno-
cent means of obtaining vicarious knowledge
about things which Nature has unhappily
forbidden them to acquire except at a price
of most bitter bodily and mental suffering.
On this theory they are really studying
Freud from a sense of duty. The worst of
it is that they believe it all, and so despe-
rately, too. You can do anything if you
make yourself believe that it is your duty.
Herr Oskar Pfister, a clergyman of Zurich,
has written a book, Some Applications of
Psycho-Analysis (Allen and Unwin), which
he calls “experiments” in psycho-analysis,
though most people would call it experi-
ments in something else. Psycho-analysis
appears to be a means of satisfying ordi-
nary human salacity under the guise of
science. True psychology is undoubtedly a
genuine science, though it sometimes verges
on the metaphysical: but. it is doubtful
whether that honorable title is to be con-
ferred upon the stories of Herr Pfister, any
more than upon the vague yarns of Conan
Doyle, though these, to he sure, are not
disgusting, but simply silly.
Herr Pfister finds incest and indecency
everywhere. He even accuses a young
artist of wanting to go back to his mother’s
womb with his sister. This unconventional
desire he discovers by looking at a perfectly
innocent picture that the poor lad had
painted and foolishly showed to the reverend
gentleman. In the most beautiful and ordi-
nary sights of nature he can only see repre-
sentations of the female genital organs; and
the most merciful thing to think about a
clergyman who can think such things is
that the poor gentleman is deranged, and
should have his own mind psycho-analysed.
It is all the fault of that low fellow Oedipus,
who has evidently done more harm to the
world than Tutankhamen himself. No won-
der Sophocles wrote one of the greatest of
tragedies about him ; he would have made it
greater if he had foreseen Freud.
So far the men of Australia and England
have largely escaped the contagion of Freud,
though unhappily the women have not, as
vou can see in any bookstall to-day; and if
the Germans are really seriously affected
by this neurotic rubbish it accounts for their
sudden collapse and despair at the end of
the war. If this theory be true, then Freud
has done some good in the world. The
Americans, of course, who are a most neuro-
tic people, have taken up Freudism whole-
sale, and we are going to hear some wonder-
ful things; to their credit they have not
yet banned “The Decameron,” which is much
less disgusting than Freud and much easier
to read.

Criticism
After one has waded through the enthu-
siastic reviews of Miss Dreary Tripe’s latest
novel, in which the lady is held to have
Dickens, Thackeray and Jane Austen (with
Hardy thrown in for a makeweight) “beaten
to a frazzle,” or glowing gush abojjt the
peculiar brand of poetry turned out by
Lohengrin Bassoon and his school, it restores
the sense of sanity and equilibrium to reflect
that Edmund Gosse and George Saintsbury
are still in the land of the living. In spite
of the fact that he is familiar with the
literature of half Europe—mr perhaps be-
cause of it —thqye is nothing of the Big
Bow-wow about Saintsbury. Witty, wise
and refreshingly human, he is not, in a
world of echoes, the least scared of the sound
of his own voice. As he says in A Scrap
Book (Macmillan), his opinions are home-
grown : “At any rate, no person that I can
think of, in racking a pretty good memory,
ever did influence my opinion in the slight-
est degree, and no author except Carlyle,
with whom in details I disagree as often as
I agree, if not oftener.” Few of us could
truthfully say the same.
Naturally Saintsbury is most interesting
on his own subject. “To repeat,” he says,
“the unceasingly repeated and as. unceas-
ingly neglected First Law of Criticism, B
is not bad because it is not A, however good
A may be.” Reviewers might emblazon that
maxim on their phylacteries; and musical
critics might paste it in their hats. “The
idea of criticism as something positive and
positively attainable, once for all —like the
quotient of a sum, the conclusion of a syl-
logism or the cast of a death-mask —is a
mere delusion.... Criticism is the result of
the re-action of the processes of one mind
on the products of another, or, to put. it
more popularly, it tells us how something
looks to, or ‘strikes,’ somebody.” He vigor-
ously denies the frequently expressed assump-
tion that good matter necessarily implies
good form, and cites Swinburne’s “Song in
Time of Revolution” —“the matter would be
mere rubbish if it were not dangerous as
well; the form is superb, and it is the form
that is the poetry.”
His “Suggestions for a Newest English
Dictionary” embrace the following
Mentality: A state of somebody else’s mind that
you dislike or don t understand.
Psychology: Something like “gesture” and men-
tality,” i.e., used without meaning.
Psycho-Analysis: Term used by persons who do
not know Greek for processes always questionable
and generally mischievous.
Having served his apprenticeship as a press-
man, he fully realises the kaleidoscopic
ability required to make a successful journal-
ist: “You may have something to propose,
but it is somebody else who disposes; and
though you may be, as I believe, one person
once proudly claimed to be, the third best
authority in England on grey shirtings, it
may fall to you to discuss the best way
of keeping a hand on the manufacture _ot
cocaine.” The cult of- hideousness which
has lately played havoc with the arts, gets
a little faithful dealing. “The most remark-
able instance of it, perhaps, is the mania tor
Russian literature. (I cannot read Rus-
sian, but, as I fancy, most of the maniacs
are in the same plight, that hardly disquali-
fies me.) Outside of Tourguenilf (whom,
calling him, I think, Turgenjew, or some-
thing of that kind, the believers exclude from
consideration as not genuinely Muscovite),
ugliness seems to me the only usual beauty
of the Russian Muse.” ... ...
Another subject on which his views will
not command general acceptance is educa-
tion. The democratic ideal of Australia and
America of one baton per knapsack does not
appeal to one who describes himself as a
crusted Tory. (He may be; but the vintage
is sound.) “The present ideal, therefore, ox
giving all the fifty millions intensive and
identical education, from kindergarten oi
even cr&che to University honors schools, not
only spells bankruptcy and other unpleasant
things... .but involves the most enormous
absurdity. You might as well attempt to
train every four-legged donkey to Derby form
and subject every drop of currant or goose-
berry juice to the elaborate processes which
turn out champagne.” As Sir Roger would
remark, there is much to be said on both
sides; but in Victoria education has become
a fetich, a “blessed word,” and this frank
outburst falls gratefully on the ear. Stephen
Leacock’s chapter on Oxford in his “Dis-
covery of England” has a distinct bearing
on the American results of extracting sun-
beams from cucumbers by universal compul-
sory education for the evolution of genius.
Andrew Lang, Henley, Austin Dobson and
Traill are each given short notices which
Prof. Saintsbury calls “necrologies,” deem-
ing it a better word than “obituaries. It
is not particularly happy, and has a sugges-
tion of the tombs of the Pharaohs and our
mucli-discussed friend Tutankhamen. Also,
there are a few passing references to Steven-
son, but not of the How-I-Once-Saw-Steven-
son-in-the-Street order with which we are so
painfully familiar. It was Saintsbury, a
personal friend, who advised “R.L.S.” to
publish his stories in book form. _ Max
Muller was right when he said it is the
heart that makes a critic, not the nose.
“A Scrap Book” is essentially a book to
provide discussion. A quaint bit of philoso-
phy is this: “The most precious gift of any
Present is that it provides you for the Future
with a Past —at the best enjoyed; at even
the worst, got over.” Saintsbury refers to
Greek literature as being the greatest save
one—the English. It is a new view ; but in
one respect English literature has certainly
been fortunate. In every age there have
been a few choice spirits—
Blest with a taste exact, yet unconfined;
A knowledge both of books and human kind,
who can prove all things and hold fast to
that which is good. Not the least name on
that apostolic scroll is George Saintsbury’s
own.
CONSTANCE E. LEWERS.
Charlotte Mew
When the song had ended in the suburban
drawing-room I found myself running over
the words of it:—
Tide be runnin’ the great world over,
’Twas only last June month I mind that we
Was thinkin’ the toss and the call in the breast of
the lover
So everlastin’ as the sea.
Here’s the same little fishes that sputter and swim,
Wi’ the moon’s old glim on the grey wet sand,
An’ him no more to me nor me to him
Than the wind goin’ over my hand.
There was a curious, unfeminine quality that
made me remember the writer’s name, and
I looked for more about her. I found that
she was still alive, and that her only contri-
bution to literature was one small book of
17 poems. But they were such as to make
me believe that a new voice had sounded
among modern poets, the most remarkable
of the women, and inferior only to the best
of the men.
Charlotte Mew -can never become a popu-
lar poet. She is too harsh, too ironic, too
elfin —in the sense of the word that makes
an elf a thing of horror and not of panto-
mime. But this very ugliness has a st ranee,
breath-catching beauty of its own, which
makes it far rarer than mere verbal felicity
and sensuous beauty of thought. Take the
poem which gives its name to her book, “The
Farmer’s Bride.” Here is the first stanza: —
Three summers since I chose a maid,
Too young, maybe—but more’s to do
At harvest-time than bide or woo.
When us was wed she turned afraid
Of love and me and all things human;
Like the shut of a winter’s day
Her smile went out, and ’twasn’t a woman—
More like a little frightened fay.
One night in the fall she runned away.
At one moment you say “Walter de la
Mare” ; at the next “Thomas Hardy” ; some-
times, too, you think of “A Shropshire Lad.”
But Miss Mew is no imitator. She has some
of the qualities of each of these artists, and
the defects of an injudicious mixture of them.
She is the singer of thwarted, misshapen
humans, who have something more or less
than human in them. “The Changeling” and
“Ken” are too long to quote in toto. too fine
to break. Ken, one the village folk might
call “a simple,” comes very near to you in
these lines: —
And I said then
If in His Image God made men
Some other must have made poor Ken,
But for his eyes, which looked at you
As two red, wounded stars might do
.... An uncouth bird
He seemed as he ploughed up the street
Groping with knarred, high-lifted feet
And arms thrust out as if to beat
Always against a threat of bars....
But the bars come, and poor Ken is con-
fined in an asylum. The poem ends won-
derfully and terribly:—
So, when they took
Ken to that place, I did not look
After he called, and turned on me
His eyes. These I shall see....
She is less happy when she treats of love
in a conventional way. One song, “A Quoi
Bon Dire,” ends in a feeble attempt to repro-
duce the Rupert Brooke spirit:—
And one fine morning in a sunny lane
Some boy and girl will meet and kiss and swear
That nobody can love their way again,
While over there
You will have smiled, I shall have tossed your hair.
The longest and finest poem in the book
is “Madeleine in Church,” the harlot at
prayer. But it is no conventional poem of
adoration. Madeleine has the strength of
her sin, and sneers at those who go snivel-
ling to their God when all else fails:—
Oh, He will take U 3 stripped ana done.
Driven into His Heart. So we are won.
Then safe —safe are we —in the shelter of His ever-
lasting wing's.
I do not envy Him His victories;
His arms are full of broken things.
She does not sell. It is hardly to be won-
dered at. People are afraid of original
spirits who dare to think strongly along
new paths. Many another genius has gone
to death almost unthought of. It is a poor
consolation to them that we may find their
virtues when they can no longer appreciate
our praise. Let Charlotte Mew have hers
while she can yet take pleasure in it.
G. A. COLLARD.
Minds and Macaulays
Jack Lindsay resumes a controversy:—
1 apologise to David McKee Wright (R.P. 3/5/’23)
for having used the word “terrific” in describing
the nature of Beethoven’s mind, since it annoys him
so deeply. However, as his reply to me consists
chiefly of a reiteration of this term, I suppose he
obtained sufficient satisfaction from that simple
form of ridicule to make it unnecessary to try 1o
understand what I had written. I did not say that
my “high” minds deliberately flouted convention;
for to flout convention is merely another way of
admitting its empire. The red waistcoat of Gautier,
the green hair of Baudelaire are neither here nor
there. They merely represent, as in the case of the
former, a humorous element of youth’s hatred of
complacence, or, as in the latter case, a feverish
desire to attract attention. Neither can be taken
seriously; certainly neither touch any question of
mental values. What X meant was that Beethoven
would not have cared much if he had had a red
waistcoat or green hair.
I stated that the people exist by a system of
moral valuations which are necessary to them as a
staff is to a cripple. But when the humanity of a
mind is perfected it no longer needs these staffs; it
can walk freely the path of its development. The
“generous emotions” of pity, sympathy and abstract
love by which the animal is taught to look beyond
itself and learn the simplest basis of responsibility
give place to the “passionate emotions”—those
which seek to image themselves in a profounder
structure of emotional form. That is, they seek in
concentrated sensuality of form a concrete condition
of emotion transcending actuality. When I say they
look “beyond” pity I know, of course, that Mr.
Wright will consider I mean “beneath” pity, just
as Nietzsche has been universally construed as mean-
ing the “blonde beast” when he speaks of Beyond-
man. However, I give Mr. Wright full leave to
misunderstand me; I would feel insulted if he did not.
Mr. Wright, being a believer in the humanisers,
those who express the people’s values and so civilise
the people, would naturally not believe that the
humanity of a mind can be perfected. Again, as he
has often stated that poetry has no form and is con-
structed by some mysterious “singing” power, my
statement that all expressions, in Art, Music or
Poetry, are built on a rhythmic curve of form, as
absolute in its melodic intervals, in poetry as in
music, and that both- a poem and a piece of music
are as bound by this central unity as a picture, has
already its point-blank denial from him.
When I called Beethoven terrific I meant that in
him this dynamic relation between mind and sense,
between a grand and epic sweep of emotion with its
development based in sensuality of image, is re-
vealed in an intensity unparalleled elsewhere. And I
meant by “high” any mind that shares in any degree
this power of responding to, or creating, an intensity
of emotion which turns passionately inwards and sug-
gests sensuously what Keats calls a “spiritual reperi-
tion” continually beyond itself. These minds, I
repeat, move towards a higher condition of life than
earth, and so, in order to differentiate them from
all whose ends find a finality in earth, whether that
end be feeble and abstract art or humanitarianism or
the mysticism that seeks to lose self, 1 used the
term “high.” These minds alone seek a higher
structural condition of self, and their humanity is
perfected.
I would not be so cruel to Macaulay as to examine
his pretensions here. To consider that Byron “posed
simply because he was so utterly frank that he never
tried to hide anything about himself from anyone is
but psychological ineptitude. To class the man who
created a whole world in “Don Juan” with a mere
“literary” character like Macaulay whom, to please
Mr. Wright, I will here definitely call a Hottentot,
albeit a well-trained and smart one, shows an in-
capacity to distinguish mental power from the mere
shell of expression. I am not concerned whether
Byron wrote some dull letters any more than by
the fact that he wrote a number of very feeble
romances. Burns can write a dull and insincere
poem like “The Cottar’s Saturday Night,” and yet
stand out himself, in the “Jolly Beggars.” It is
only the work where the essence of the individual
psyche is impressed that matters. And, going this
path to find the core of self, to set in action deeper
and still deeper structural elements of that self, it
will not bother itself about those things in which
man’s salvation is involved.
This aloofness may translate itself into a complete
indifference to the action of existence, as in Beet-
hoven, or into a wild impulse to control it and
impress it a little with his inner coherence of vision,
as in Wagner. I trust I have made it sufficiently
clear that my statements are not so arbitrary or
childish as Mr. Wright would suppose. I have no
desire for his impartiality: I confess that I wish to
see the world through my own eyes alone. And anyone
who seeks to create his own eyes must find his own
values —that is, those elements which serve as a
stimulus for him and those which depress. Without
individual values there would be no mind at all.

Violet Blue Eyes.
By “PHLOX.”
ii T AS a wallflower again last night,
mother.”
“Most unfortunate, my dear, most
unfortunate. I can’t think who you take
after; certainly not after me. Anyway, w :•
must try and many you off.”
“Suppose I don’t want to marry?”
“I’m not going to suppose anything of
the sort.”
"But if no man asks me?”
“Then, you’ve got to do your part, and
see that he does.”
"That I’ll never do.”
"Tlien you’d better go into a nunnery.”
"No, mother; that wouldn’t suit me. I’m
Lm fond of the joys of the world.”
“What about going to the Islands as a
missionary ?”
“And run the chance of being eaten?”
"Whatever you do in this world, my dear,
you have to take your chance.”
‘Anyway, mine’s not going to be in the
Cannibal Islands.”
“By the way, Millicent, what are you
wearing for the dance on Tuesday?”
“I’m not going to the dance.”
“Not going! Why?”
1 overheard that horrid Talbot girl say
to Bessie Myers that my sjdn was blotchy,
and my hair like rats’ tails.”
"IIow very rude of her.”
“Rude! I call it beastly. Anyway, I
have a grain of comfort. Jack Summers
says that I have lovely violet-blue eyes.”
“Of course you have.”
* * *
Instead of going to the dance Millicent
had .Tones drive her to the home of Mrs.
Douglas—a friend of whom she was very
fond.
‘I’m delighted to see you, dear,” was Mrs.
Douglas’s greeting; “but I understood you
to say that you were going to a dance to-
night.”
I was, but —er —well, I’m tired of being
a wallflower.”
I m sorry, dear. Did you enjoy that
book I lent you?” >
I did, indeed; especially where Trine
says that you can usually be what you make
up your mind to be. Now, I want to be
beautiful. Do you think if I desire beauty
long enough, and earnestly enough, it will
ever come to me?”
“It will, dear, if, as well as desiring, you
take practical means of assisting nature.”
“I would love to. I wonder if you would
beJdnd enough to advise me?”
In the first place you need a good cream
that will nourish, and at the same time
remove the discoloration from your skin.”
“I did use a cream, and that horrid hair
you see on my face is the result.”
“So many creams do grow hair on the
face: but have you ever tried mercolized
wax ?”
“No; I’ve heard of it. I thought, how-
ever, that it, too, might favor the growth
of hairs.”
‘ Not at all, dear. I’ve used it for quite
a long time. You’ve heard of Frenchwomen
going into retirement during Lent, and hav-
ing the skin of their faces and necks re-
moved by a painful process.”
“Yes; I’ve read about it.”
“Well, mercolized wax has the same effect
without causing any pain or inconvenience.
At night, before retiring, you simply wash
your face in warm water, using a good
soap—I always use Pilenta Soap—then
apply the wax to your face and neck.
Wash it off in the morning, and before
powdering rub in a little of the mercolized
wax,. which ig obtainable from most good
chemists. Instead of ordinary powder I
always use cleminite, which gives that soft
velvety bloom to the comp’fexion.
“For those blackheads on your nose and
chin, stymol tablets are the best cure. Drop
a tablet in a tumbler of hot water, and when
the fizzing has subsided bathe the face with
the liquid. After drying you will find that
the blackheads have come out on the towel.
“For the hairs on your face there’s
nothing better than powdered pheminol,
which removes the hairs without disfiguring
the skin.”
“How very fortunate I met you, Mrs.
Douglas.”
“Now, for your hair. The first thing to
be done is to shampoo it with stallax!”
“Yes, I’ve written that down. But I don’t
suppose you know of anything that will
keep my hair in curl?”
“Yes, I do —something, in fact, that will
make it curl.”
“How marvellous!”
“It’s a perfectly simple preparation, called
silmerine, which you can get at the chemist’s
and you apply on retiring at night. Brush
jour hair out in the morning, when it will
be beautifully wavy, and any short pieces
curly.”
“Oh, how lovely that will be! You can’t
think what a load you’ve taken off my mind.
Now if you would only prescribe something
for my red hands. I’m so ashamed of them.”
“I can, dear, give you a prescription that
I’ve tried myself with the best results. Add
bicrolium jelly to your list of wants from
the chemist. This pleasant, non-greasy sub-
stance quickly blanches the hands, removes
tan, clears out the dirt which soap cannot
reach, and makes the skin soft, white and
smooth.”
“How clever of you, Mrs. Douglas, to
know all these things.”
“I’ve just found them out by degrees.”
“Oh, there’s Jones for me. Good-night.
Mrs. Douglas; I don’t know how to thank
you.”
“Don’t, dear; but consistently use what
I have told you. When you have improved
your skin and hair you will be quite beauti-
ful, and should make many conquests with
those pretty violet-blue eyes.”

‘Reduction in prices
T& NEW EDISON
Due to favorable conditions, we can now
announce a considerable reduction in price
for all models of “The New Edison” —flawless
Re-Creator of every kind of music and product
of a master mind in the science of acoustics.
THOMAS A. EDISON. LIMITED. 364-372 Kent Street. Sydney.
What
Edison said
and what
he did.
“If music is 'fvorth anything—and in my opinion it
is worth much—then it is worth nothing less than
perfect recording and perfect reproduction.”
And, believing this, he spent £600,000 in his search
for that perfection. Now he has attained the end
he sought for, and offers you the result of his labor:
An instrument that Re-Creates every overtone and
sound color with absolute fidelity— as proved by
actual tests by direct comparison on public plat-
forms.
A diamond reproducer—so there are no needles to
change— or to cut the records—or to be worn out
before a selection is half-finished.
Motive power fior the reproducer—notf ng so un-
scientific as having the sound-groove move the
reproducer by friction.
Re-Creations that are thick enough to give the true
tone without local vibrations—that are so hard as
to be free from wear or breakage—that are so finely
engraved as to- contain nearly twice as much music
per inch.
Ability to play all talking-machine records at their
very best, while no other machine will play Edison
Re-Creations without detriment.
By these, and other improvements, the world’s
greatest inventor offers you a perfect instrument
for your home, therefore you should not be satisfied
with anything less. Write to-day for Catalogues of
Edison Period Models and Edison Disc Re-Creations.

file tulips stand like soldiers row on row,
Crimsonly gilded in the sun’s last glow ;
Old Dusk’s thin feet lisp low upon the grass
And little da.sies kiss tnem as they pass.
Laughter of children fades and swells again
And then it ceases, but a faint refrain
Is tangled in the wind which weaves a croon
Out of a smile to lullaby the moon.
The trees stretch yearning hands to catch
the white,
Elusive stars which coronet the night.
In the palm-grove a plaintive bird still sings,
And every frond a slender shadow flings
As some pale novice seeking knowledge there
Dabbles liis fingers in Enchantment’s hair.

PAMELA TRAVERS.
The Return.
On a wild day of wind and foam
I shall go home.
The circling sea-birds, flying low,
Will gather close to watch me go,
Crying “God-speed” as they wheel and flash
Over the breakers that mount and crash,
And fall to rest.
I have stayed too long to go in peace
With the sea, a lamb with milky fleece,
Leading me through the strange salt flowers.
Past the sea-maids’ fretted bowers
To where they wait.
I dare nor. come to the silver strand
That gardens the palace with gleaming baud,
And. "mounting the stairway smooth as jet,
Cry “It is I —it is Margaret!
A bare, grey room and a cruel bell
Have held me long in their bitter spell—
I was trapped by a book and a whirr,ng
wheel,
And a kiss that only the dead can feel;
But now, dear ones, I am here at the gate!”
It is too late.
Never again may I laugh and shout,
“Dear ones, come out!”
But some day when the sea is high
Then I will try.
With wild birds crying in my ear.
Strong with courage, faint with fear,
Breasting a grey and angry sea—
St. Barbara, turn your face from me—
I shall go home.
My feet that dare not mount the stair
Will tap like dead white flowers there.
My hands, that never more may press
Beloved hands, will then caress
The cold, green stone.
Surely when they see me so—
Who was wont to proudly go
Up and down the stairway wide,
Gay and laughing as a bride—
They will not say, “She comes too late:
Close fast the gate!”
I think perhaps they will be kind,
Tenderly my hair unbind.
Lay me on a seaweed bed,
And whisper, “Now that she is dead
She may come home—
Cease forever to pine and fret,
Poor Margaret!”

Waning Moon.
The mice of the Dark have nibbled the moon
Where it lav on the shelves of Day,
And where it was round as the sun at noon
They have bitten one half away !
A waning moon, where the witfches ride
On trotting broomsticks across its face,
With the lean cats swaying from side to
side,
Till the world is a haunted place !
I must hang some garlic above my door
Lest a vampire stray from the graveyard
wall;
I must tell my rosary o’er and o’er,
And I must not walk on the moor at all,
For who can say what its miles may hold
Or the grey mist yield to me?
There are things all rigid, and blue, and cold,
Where the brown moor meets the sea.
I have latched the door, but I hear it move;
I have closed the shutter with wooden
bars,
For this is the night that the goblins love
When a black pool holds the stars.
I must trim my lamp, put my knitting by,
And read from the Holy Book.
There are bat wings blown on a livid sky
And the moon dies as you look.

The Balcony.
Some day when I am gone
You will look up from the echoing street
And say, “There did she stand
And toward me wave her hand!”
And you will find in the wind
A deeper scour,
In the dark of night
A darker hour.
And sometimes when the sun.
Slow-sinking, fades towards his dim re-
treat —
Left but the royal red
Above his cloudy bed—
Then you will grieving say.
“She, too, is gone away!”
And there will stir in your heart
A shaft of pain,
And an olden ache
Complain.
And sometimes as a flight
Of doves shall whirl within the sky and turn
(A fan of feathered thought
His hand flung up and caught),
Then will your empty heart
Cry in a sudden smart,
“Gone is that so swift mind
Nor time nor place could bind !”
And a shadow will fall.
Though the sun may shine,
For a look and a face
Was mine.

BRITAIN’S SOS.
“Responding to the toast of the Navy at the
Royal Academy banquet, Mr. Ameky, First Lord of
the Admiralty, said it was obvious that the defence
of the Empire could net be sustained indefinitely by
one small island in the North Sea. It must depend
upon the co-partnership of the Dominions.”
A familiar feature of many big families is
the able-bodied male adult who objects to
leave the shelter of the paternal roof and
make a career for himself. He has all sorts
of specious arguments to show that his life
of leisure at home is founded on righteous-
ness and commonsense. His devotion to his
mother makes the mere thought of leaving
her a form of disloyalty. Rather than do
it he may offer to pay a small sum out of
his earnings into the family exchequer—not his
full share of the upkeep of the house, of course,
but something approximating to the cost of
the food he eats. The house not being his,
it would be inequitable to expect him to con-
tribute more lavishly. And as often as he
is asked when he means to launch out on
his own account, and assume responsibilities
from which his father did not shrink, he
replies that there is plenty of time; that
youth must have its fling; that the art of
walking lias to be learnt before running is
attempted, and so on. Australia occupied
this inglorious position in regard to the
United Kingdom for over a century. Thirteen
years ago the Commonwealth, in a manner
of speaking, became responsible for its own
rates and taxes. Amidst bitter complaints
from our professional loyalists that the
motherland was being betrayed and deserted,
Australia invested in the nucleus of a fleet.
By the time the crisis arrived in 1914 it
was capable of protecting part of its over-
seas traae, thus removing a tremendous
burden irom the R.N.; and when an expedi-
tionary force of 300,000 fighting men was
provided it seemed that at last Australia
had grown up, had left its days of cadg.ng
dependence, and its talk of Empire loyalty
as an excuse for the avoidance of taxation,
forever behind.
• # * *
Less than eight years ago a Dominions
Minister announced with the concurrence of
all the other Dominions, and with no objec-
tions from Downing-street: "It is realised
that the great policies and questions which
concern and govern the issues of peace and
war cannot in future be decided by the
people of the British Islands alone.” W. M.
Hughes signed the Versailles treaty on be-
half of Australia, claiming that the one-
time colony had achieved the status of an
international Power. For a period as brilli-
ant as it was brief the Commonwealth re-
tained the reputation it had won during the
war period. And then came a moral and
every other sort of collapse. The A.J.F. was
formed into a camouflage reserve and pre-
sently disbanded. The R.A.N. was allowed
to become obsolete as regards its ships, and
the pre-war habit was revived of discredit-
ing and discouraging the personnel, in the
name of Empire unity. Aviation was practi-
cally killed, and the C.M.F. reduced to skin
and bone. The wheel has come full circle,
and Australia is back where it started from
when the Reid-Cook Government objected
to citizen service as conscription, and to the
Ii.A.N. as a “mosquito fleet” that was useless
because it was not all-powerful. The politi-
cal party which first gave Australia a
national defence scheme has turned pacifist.
The Tories are calling for the return of what
they call the “good old flag” to Australian
waters, meaning thereby a reversion to the
hired-navy principle. Only last week the
Argus, which was glad enough of the pro-
tection of the R.A.N. throughout the war,
and which during that time would have
severely rebuked anyone who had depreci-
ated it, remarked :
Australia may or may not be called upon to
defend herself. If she is not, the fact that she has
no fleet will not concern her. If she is, then she
will be best off if she has the protection of a great
Imperial fleet. To maintain an ineffective fleet of
our own is throwing money away for a mere fancy.
And at the recent Melbourne conference of
the R. S. and S. I. League, of all places, a
delegate objected to any form of Australian
navy on the ground that the Australia did
not hang round the coasts of the Cofnmon-
wealth during the last war, and that unless
a navy hung round the coasts of those who
paid for it, it was not doing its job as a
defending force.
* * * •
It is inconceivable that Prime Minister
Bruce should be going to the Imperial Con-
ference with such ideas. Ilis right to be
there at all is based on nothing out the fact
that, for however brief a period in its his-
tory, Australia went in ter a full instalment
of local defence. A Power is what the
word implies: not an aggregation of human
beings that, in certain circumstances, might
be capable of paying someone to defend
them, but a nation capable at all times of
defending itself. By the end of 1918 Aus-
tralia was everything that is meant by a
Power. It may be that Mr. Bruce will have
to admit that his predecessor pushed in
amongst the treaty-signers at Versailles
under false pretences; that, though the
British and French who backed Hughes be-
lieved Australian defence to be healthy, the
politicians in Melbourne knew’ it was vir-
tually a corpse. He will certainly have to
admit the disappearance of both the army
and the navy that gave Hughes the position
he held. What will be his justification for
taking his seat at the Conference table, and
claiming on behalf of the Commonwealth the
right not only to be defended in future wars
but to be consulted as to whether or no they
shall be started? The Argus naively sug-
gests “a contribution” to the Singapore naval
base scheme—a scheme wdiich will run to
only £200,000 for dock-construction costs
this year, and which is scheduled to cost
only £10,000,000 in the next 10 years. In
return for an annual fraction of this amount
the British taxpayer is expected to pay for
the convoying of our transports in any war
for the defence of Australia which does not
happen to be fought in Australia, to protect
from the Emdens of the future our sea-
borne trade, the interruption of which would
bring death by starvation to thousands,
and to put up at all times with our dictation
as to whether the Empire may or may not
go to war. It would take a confidence man
of great effrontery to put forward such a
proposal, and Tiie Bulletin gives Mr.
Bruce the credit for having no intentions of
the sort. What he pan self-respectingly adpit
is that in view of our w’ar-commitments the
R.A.N. as originally conceived has had to
be modified, and may have to be modified h
great deal more. But if he expresses the
sentiment of Australia he will point out
that there will be no divergence from the
principle of a local autonomous navy. The
size of the R.A.N. in the first instance is
not likely to particularly concern the Admi-
ralty. The requirement will be, as in the
late w T ar, that it shall be homogeneous—
capable of being instantly incorporated for
fighting purposes with a unit of the R.N.
in any part of the world where the defence
of the Empire is being undertaken. Once
such an institution is properly established—
once, that is to say, it is removed from the
arena of party politics—-it tends to grow as
the nation grows, which was the natural
and inevitable way the British Navy grew.
Australia’s coastal defence is not and never
will be an affair of battleships sitting down
outside great cities in the expectation of
an enemy attack. If an assault is made on
this country while the R.N. remains above
water, it will take the form of a surprise
expedition of aeroplane-carriers escorted by
cruisers and destroyers. The most effective
form of defence will consist of military air-
craft capable of successfully engaging the
enemy bombers, and it has been estimated
that a couple of hundred machines would
meet all Australia’s needs in that direction
for many years to come. But, in any event,
such attacks can be only outpost affairs. The
real struggle, the one involving this country’s
life or death as a nation, will take place at
sea, as in the last war, and probably many
thousands of miles from our coasts. A navy
is the only practical contribution we can
offer in the circumstances, and the British
are not the people to cavil at the smallness
of it provided they are g.ven to understand
that it will not always be small.
LABOR IN WESTRALIA.
Collier, the Westralian Labor leader, has
been bring destructive broadsides at the
Government of his friend Mitchell, de-
scribed by the critic as “a straightforward
opponent and an honorable man.” In the
estrangement between the Cockies and the
Lib.-Lab. group, who have been associated
in the so-called National Ministry since
1917 and whose alliance will terminate in
March, 1924 (unless Mitchell denounces
it sooner), Labor sees a chance of returning
to office, and Collier is out to make the
most of it. But the difficulties of this very
unusual Labor politician are great. Per-
haps it is the difficulties that make him un-
usual. The character of the electoral popu-
lation has changed materially since Col-
lier’s party swept the country 12 years ago,
winning 34 of the 50 Assembly seats. There
are thousands more farmers than there were
then (incidentally, not one farming consti-
tuency is represented by a Labor member)
and thousands fewer miners. In 1911 every
goldfields seat was a soft thing for the Labor
man, and there were 13 altogether. In 1924,
unless the Redistribution of Seats Bill falls
by the wayside, there may be only nine gold-
fields electorates (there can’t be more than
10), and inasmuch as the miners are still
divided by bitter memories of the conscrip-
tion split—wider and deeper in Westralia
than anywhere else—Labor will probably
lose two of them, possibly three. Another
pertinent fact, revealed by the census-taker,
is that the proportion of females to males
increased 13 p.c. between 1911 and 1921.
In other States this might be advantageous
to Labor, but Collier and his friends have
been distrustful of the women’s vote since
1916. At both conscription referendums, and
at every election since, the W.A. ladies
turned them down cold.
* * # *
The Westralian wage-earner, being very
largely a citizen who owns a savings-bank
account, and pays taxes to the Government
and rates to the municipal council (the pro-
portion of workers who are their own land-
lords is higher in Perth than in any other
metropolitan area), demands a milder brand
of politics than his congener at Sydney or
Newcastle. The Groper industrialist is the
least turbulent of his kind. Even the coal-
miners, so tempestuous elsewhere, get along
without strikes, and send to Parliament an
elderly Scot who served in the war with a
labor battalion, and whose wildest indiscre-
tion is the writing of haggis-verse a long
way after Burns. Westralia, in short, is
increasingly a land of small farmers, fruit-
growers, pastoralists, mineowners, bush con-
tractors and pieceworkers; and Collier is
too shrewd a man to court such an electorate
with the odious claptrap of the Dooleys and
McGirrs. He appeals to it on worthier
grounds than mere vulgar cupidity and class
bias. In the Eastern States it would be as
much as a Labor leader’s job was worth to
say a word in favor of the introduction of
white settlers, but Collier and his lieu-
tenant Angwin are avowed immigrationists.
The former’s case against the Government
is, not that it is carrying out an immigra--
tion policy of sorts (“it is all important,”
he says, “to increase our population”), but
that in the last three years there has been
a gain of only 1979 by excess of arrivals over
departures, although 9113 assisted immi-
grants were brought in.
Similarly, instead of taking the Dooley-
McGirr view that deficits are things to be
proud of, Collier scarifies the Government
for its chronic debit balance —£700,000 in its
first year, £705 000 in the second, £636,000
in the third, and so on. As to taxation, the
Dooleys joyously doubled the income-tax in
their first year of office, and were about to
tack on another 50 p.c. when the fed-up elec-
tors intervened. A count in Collier’s in-
dictment of the Mitchell Government is
that it has been “piling up taxation” on in-
comes, dividends, licenses and the like, and
letting the pre-war land-value tax fall like
thistledown on the speculators, sharks, etc.,
who have made fortunes in the land boom.
By way of illustration :
In 1916 the land-value tax produced £41,000.
The total amount last year was £42,000. During
recent years land values ard rents have increased
enormously in Perth and in the neighborhood of new
railways. The development of any land hundreds of
miles away has the effect of increasing the value of
land in the city'. Yet the total amount received last
year from the metropolitan area was only £22,000.
That is useful criticism, and illustrates the
vast difference there is between Collier’s
ideas of finance and taxation and the cant
of Dooley and Theodore. The latter are
given to boasting that the workers pay no
income-tax, the whole burden falling on the
capitalist. Of course, the workers pay in
increased prices and rents, and in uneniploy-
ment; indeed, they are probablv worse off in
their nominally exempt condition than if
they were not exempt. No class would gain
more by the substitution of a scientific sys-
tem of taxation, democratic in its incidence,
for the crude and overlapping imposts with
which Australia is at present smitten ; but
most Australian politicians go into Parliament
densely ignorant of this part of their business,
and few ever trouble to study it. Collier
seems to be one of the exceptions. His de-
parture from the current Labor belief in the
annual deficit and in terrific income-taxes,
imposed on political opponents in a spirit
of sheer savagery, may not ensure his suc-
cess at the polls. Very likely it won’t. But
the man is on the right track.
THEIR TASK AND OURS.
Denmakk is a prosperous, comfortable little
nation, as nations so in Europe now. It was
not so always. When, after long, disastrous
wars, she lost to Germany in 1804 the
duchies of Holstein and Slesvig, she
was in the last stages of decay and poverty.
A total area of only 15,000 sq. miles; a
broken agricultural population little better
than serfs; a poor soil; little mineral or
manufacturing wealth; a bleak, hostile cli-
mate; fog-laden winds blowing incessantly
(Copenhagen, a favored spot, claims but
50 sunny days a year") : sea and wind
steadily encroaching on the land, its average
level but 95 feet above high water, and cut
by many sinuous inlets —a very derelict of a
land! It had not always been like that. Three
or four thousand years before, on this same
Jutland peninsula, folk of the Stone, and
later the Bronze, Age hunted in great forests
of oak and fir, and tilled the fertile soil and
reared cattle in their shelter. Later came
Christianity, civilisation, affluence. Then
wars, destruction, famine. Greed of man
slew the forests. The west wind swept tri-
umphantly, driving plant life before it. Deso-
lation reigned. Where once stood populous
towns only the stone foundations could be
traced deep under wilds of heath. Forest
and fertile soil and stonemen were gone;
only their burial-mounds and dim traditions
remained. Men of vision there were, happJy,
who could read that dim past and on that
past build a dream future.
From the vague dream triumph came at
last. To save the wasted country, the sand
dunes heaped by the North Sea along the
coast must first be checked in their drift in-
wards. Already they had annihilated much
of the province. Salvation could only come
with afforestation. But how to establish
forest in face of that driving wind and on
soil so poor and water-logged and sour?
Science had proved it could be done. The
Danish rank and file in the slough of despair
and ignorance—could they be brought to do
it? Those few statesmen of vision threw
themselves into the task. The value of agri-
cultural education was forced home. The
whole nation, young and old, literally went
to school again. The imagination of a
people was fired ; the thought form grew to
material form. Slowly, laboriously, the re-
clamation of the waste, which was to more
than compensate for the lost duchies, went
on. The rivers were sluggish and winding;
most of the land was mere fen. Rivers were
straightened; marshes were drained; where
gravitation could not accomplish this, water
was lifted by pump or windmill from bogs,
and the land made useful, even though much
must be kept dry by powerful windmills.
But drainage was only the first step. The
soil itself did not contain the necessary
plant food. Phosphates were brought from
Florida.; potash from Germany. Lime was
found in their own land —by digging deep
enough and hard enough. “Thank God, it
bubbles !” exclaimed a lime-hunter, with pro-
bably as much emotion as ever a good Aus-
tralian nugget brought to a prospector,
lhese elements, with thorough cultivation,
made the foundation of the good land to be.
But the trees, the red spruce, did not thrive.
1 hey sickened and died, or became stunted
and worthless. They could not gather from
this atmosphere and heather-soil the neces-
sary nitrogen. Many trials were made, and
still failure. Was the dream only a dream?
Hardy wild mountain-firs were introduced.
Their hardiness sprang from a remarkable
nitrogen-fixing capacity. Even red spruce
planted near them thrived. They planted
red spruce again, each with its wild fir as
nurse-tree. Both throve; and presently it
was found that the spruce could live alone
once the soil was “inoculated” by its nitro-
gen-fixing nurse. It was a momentous dis-
covery. To-day Denmark has magnificent
forests breaking and tempering the sweep of
the North Sea winds; and in their shelter,
prosperity, rich pasture lands and a world-
fame for cattle and dairy produce. Aus-
tralia has imported vast quantities of build-
ing and cabinet timber. I wonder how much
of that hard-won Baltic pine has come bump-
ing across the seas to us!
Looking back at the efforts of the Danes,
what a soft job ours seems by comparison!
We want trees, forests; not perhaps with
such a dire need as theirs, but sorely enough.
I orestry to us would be the foundation of a
newer prosperity just as surely as it was
to them. But instead of a restricted area
with no choice of climate we have a whole
continent on which to pick patches to plant
our forests. We have a range of climate
and soil wherein \ye might adopt and culti-
vate any known kind of tree that ever was
any use to man or ever will be. And we
have some of the most wonderful and the
most beautiful and the staunchest and most
serviceable indigenous timbers to encourage
us to go ahead. A thing is proved good when
shrewd people set out to steal it. Already
Californians are beginning to look on the
blue-gum as a native of their land. And
South Africans are stealthily claiming the
same of our black wattles. Nature endowed
Australia lavishly with hardwood; it is in
our hands to remedy her niggardliness in re-
gard to commercial softwoods. Certainly we
have droughts and places marked “Desert”
on the map ; but few living things will stand
drought as established trees will.
The nibble of the elements at our coastline
is not as on that meagre Jutland Peninsula.
But already our land is feeling the wear on
her scanty forest mantle. We are clearing
the mallee as fast as possible, looking back
over our shoulder for applause while we
make, it into a gigantic wheatfield. The
warning is written already in dams and
fences—buildings even—buried under the
sand-drift; and would be writ larger but
that some are discerning enough to save at
least a quota of the stunted trees. We have
cleared forests from light lands (“improve-
ments,” they called it in the Lands Depart-
ment papers), and in the forests’ stead reign
now, not crops or pasture land, but thorn
and weed and poison flower. Certainly our
State Governments have done some afforesta-
tion work; but we are using or destroying
our forests faster, much faster, than we are
replacing them.
Have the Australians who were in France
forgotten the woods? Do they think that a
thrifty people like the French would have
maintained them if they did not serve a
useful purpose? So assured have the French
by their centuries of experience that,
when the German flood was swept back, the
restoration of destroyed woods went on side
by side with the restoration of destroyed
dwellings. They knew that without the
forests the dwellings would soon be un
tenanted.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Electoral Rolls.
Foot States, including, of course, Queens-
land and the Eternal Nark, N. S. Wales,
still refuse to utilise the Federal electoral
rolls for State purposes. The one-roll idea


is a matter of accepting the Federal elec-
torates, and giving enough State members to
each to make a State House or two Houses
of the size required. It prevents the carv-
ing out of constituencies the shape of a
wallaby to rope in all the scattered interests
that are favorable to Smifkins, M.L.A.;
and the Commonwealth being fairly honest,
it prevents the dead and the unborn and
the never-will-be-born rushing too numer-
ously to the poll and voting the Ministerial
ticket. The shocking difference that would
have been made in Queensland if the Federal
roll had been adopted for State purposes
about six years ago appears in the following
statistics, the State figures being compared
with those of the nearest Federal election: —
Queensland under Denham.
Federal State State
Electors. Electors. Surplus.
1915 .. 302,370 335,195 32,825
Under Ryan and Theodore.
1918 .. 378,296 424,416 46,120
1920 .. 389,200 445,681 56,481
1923 . . 405,941 504,013 98,072
Some fairly remarkable things happened
under Labor rule in N. S. Wales, but these
Queensland phenomena are extra-remark-
able. The election of 1920 was a painfully
narrow escape for the ruling faction, so the
discovery of these wonderful voters whom
the Federal authority can't find by any pos-
sibility was accelerated. And. apparently,
on Saturday’s results, the acceleration
thoroughly justified itself. When Queens-
land gets a different kind of Government
its first move, by way of fortifying itself
in office., and averting suspicion, and
also ‘saving some money, should be to
make the Federal roll the State one also.
After that it. might pass a law making three
years the minimum for the spook-raisers or
body-snatchers who carry elementary spirits
and the like to polling places.
Bruce’s Railway.
One proposition in Prime Minister Bruce’s
policy, as expounded at Perth, will almost
certainly prove to be loaded in an aston-
ishing number of barrels. It is that the
Commonwealth should build a 500-mile rail-
way (4ft. Biin gauge) from Port Augusta
(S.A.) to Hay (N.S.W.), and an isolated 97
miles from Kyogle (N.S.W.) to Brisbane
(Q.). The 97-mile link is missing simply
because N.S.W. has systematically neglected
to keep its promise to Queensland to join
their systems at the border; and if the
Commonwealth takes on the work of paying
for the broken promises of rich States, and
taxing poor ones to do so, it will find plenty
of wbrk for its hands. The 500-mile line
from Port Augusta to Hay embodies a lot
of considerations pro and con. :—
It and the 97-mile scrap will give a clear run on
a uniform gauge from Kalgoorlie to Brisbane, pro-
vided N.S.W. completes its North line. And pro-
vided that Westralia can be reminded of its broken
promise to turn its Kalgoorlie-Fremantle line into
a 4ft. SJin. work, there will be one gauge right
through, and the distance will be shortened. The
Commonwealth will own 1650 miles of the work,
including all the worst country.
The shortening will be a boon, especially as it
lias become a fixed idea that it is the paramount
duty of the Commonwealth to provide the quickest
possible transit for a few mails and passengers 'to
Perth, though it possesses practically no land on
the route. This is partly because Westralia con-
siders that its interests lie that way, and Westralia
has got • into the habit of having a claim on poorer
and more heavily taxed States to do things for it.
Moreover, a serviceable line to the South-West, along
the shore and across the desert, will have military
value in case of invasion. No one knows when the
Kaffir may break out and come across in ships.
A uniform railway gauge is good at any time.
Some people think it should be applied also, or
even supplied first, on a complete South-to-North
railway because: (1) The North has no through rail-
way at all, while the West has one, even though
the gauge is a trifle mixed; (2) the South-to-North
work is a legal obligation and a matter of honor,
while the Westralian one was never more than a
vote-catching stunt; (3) S. Australia paid lavishly
in land grants for the Territory line, wherefore
the Commonwealth has a great estate there to
develop, but Westralia paid nothing, unless supply-
ing that interminable place-holder, Senator Pearce,
is payment; (4) there is more rich land in the
North than in the West, and more big rivers, and
there are potential enemies to be guarded against up
there a thousand times more dangerous than the Kaffir,
who, after all, isn’t a seafaring bird like the Japanese,
Chinaman or Malay, and the northern line is as
much a mail route as the western one.
One difficulty that the Prime Minister may en-
counter is that of getting the necessary authority
from S. Australia to build the section from Port
Augusta to the Cornstalk border within its terri-
tory. The position is that Bruce seems to have
£8,000,000 to scatter on railways provided they
are not in Federal territory, and provided they' do
not include the line that S. Australia paid for with
a land grant of 200,000 acres per mile, and which
is the only one that involves a point of honor. lie
has given no portfolio to a S. Australian, presum-
ably lest the S.A. man might talk of this mattev,
though he found room for a man from less populous
; Westralia. And by way of adding clumsy insult to
bulky injury he has sent his Westralian colleague
to report on the state of affairs in the N. Territory,
and he both comes and goes via Queensland, so that
he may confer with the local politicians who oppose
the South-to-North railway in the hope of getting
a purely local railway at Federal cost instead. The
Westralian Minister who has gone to the N. Terri-
tory is-.expected to announce ‘ that the South-to-
North line is quite superfluous, and that any avail-
able £8,000,000 is much better' spent in doing
things for Westralia. Wherefore the S. Australian
worm may turn at last, and tell Bruce that until
he fulfils his obligation in the matter of the South-
to-North route he won’t make use of its land for
any purpose whatever. It is a long worm that has
no turning.
Bruce’s proposed line via Hay will really be a
considerably longer transcontinental than Holman’s
way via Condobolin, Menindie and Broken Hill, but
it may get • Victorian support as a Federal work,
which the shorter route wouldn’t. If the quaint
and complicated idea by which 1 Victoria is to build,
own and work railways in the south-west of N.S.W.
comes off, Victoria will be able to connect with
Bruce’s railway. Most probably the idea will not
come off, but will collapse:'at the last moment, as
so many complicated ideas do..
Taking one . consideration with another
Bruce’s railway-in-the-clouds has about as
many aspects as the rinc'-opiA tv—ip-
fion in the property-dealing shark’s adver-
tisement.
An Appeal to Labor, the Slum-dweller.
“That the United Laborers’ Protective Society
strongly urges the Municipal Labor pa-tv to give
precedence to the removal of slum tenements and
the ereition of up-to-date dwellings for workers in
city industries and callings, which would give em-
ployment while the work is in progress, as well as
providing suitable accommodation for the workers,
and that costly resumption schemes for the adorn-
ment of the city should receive secondary considera-
tion from Labor aldermen.” —Resolution passed at
Sydney meeting.
A feature of the deceased N. S. Wales
Labor Government was that it was more
furiously opposed than even the oldest sample
of Toryism to the creation of new States,
which would have involved new capitals
wherein the Government might have tried its
hand at being ground landlord. Northern
Separationists cornered old Minister Estell,
and forced from him a statement on the ques-
tion. In his official fury he got as near to
threatening New Staters with mutilation and
death as a very wild old man could. Looked
at from a brutally selfish point of view his
attitude was understandable, for as Minister
for YY orks and Railways his pomp would have
been grievously diminished if iiis kingdom
was reduced by 75 per cent. His colleagues
occupied a similar position. But the in-
terests of the rank and file of the party lie
in precisely the opposite direction, though
their little official kings, always thinking
of the preservation of their dominions un-
impaired, instruct them not to see it. All
the rebuilding in the world won’t alter these
facts: (1) The municipalities close around
Sydney which are convenient for the work-
ers to live in are already more densely packed
than Glasgow—reckoned the prize shocking
example, bar London, of crowded old Britain.
(2) Matters are bound to grow worse, for
the present system, which the New State
movement aims to remove, deliberately
packed into Sydney in the 10 years between
censuses, not only far more new population
than the increase of bad old Glasgow, but
148,210 more than the increase in the popu-
lation of the whole of Scotland (Sydney in-
crease, 269,594; Scotland, 121,384). Of
course, the country districts were shamefully
robbed of inhabitants to make Sydney’s in-
crease. (3) Matters must get doubly worse,
because all new factories are forced, by rail-
way and other devices, to locate in Sydney,
and country industries are also being re-
moved there. The inference is that the griev-
ance which the U.L.P.S. complains of is
only beginning. And as no one has the
courage, whatever the U.L.P.S. may say, to
turn whole streetsful of people into the open
country while their slums are being destroyed
and rebuilt, any serious attempt at reform
seems impossible. While Labor officially en-
courages the intensification of the evil, it
can hardly hope for better things, and il
isn’t even certain that it deserves much
better. The true remedy is equally obvious.
If four or five new States were carved out
of N. S. Wales and Queensland, four or five
new capitals would have to be built, or little
existing towns reconstructed and enlarged to
make capitals. A Federal Government may
lodge at Melbourne, which is, after all, its
own territory, but a State Government
couldn’t lodge in a rival State’s territory.
Nor would it care to doss beneath a waggon.
This looks like the employment the U.L.P.S.
is asking for, and a long assured job to boot.
In the new capitals the workers could all
have “up-to-date dwellings” and “suitable
accommodation,” for the first essentials
(which are space, light and air) would be
available. If they did degenerate like Sydney
the present generation would have time to be
comfortably dead before the trouble became
serious. Then, if the mad influx of popula-
tion into the Old Big City dropped from
27,000 per annum to 2700, there would be
a better chance to rebuild the slums, and
there might be work for the members of the
U.L.P.S.
e
The Jury System and the Lawyers.
Tiie jury system has been collecting numer-
ous tributes of this sort from lawyers all
over Australia of late: —
At the Darlinghurst (Sydney) Sessions Mr.
McKean, Crown Prosecutor, said that he did not
wish to, and would not, attack the jury system;
but the form of the juries at Darling-hurst varied
like the form of racing ponies, and once some
juries left the jury box to consider their verdict
they left their eommonsense on the seats on which
they had been sitting.
Giving evidence at Adelaide before the Law Re-
form Commission, Mr. Thomas O’Hallokan (for
the Law Society) said that juries often refused to
find on the facts. While a recently tried case was
on he was informed on testimony which he accepted
that some of the jurors had been discussing a sen-
tence of two years imposed on a young man whom
they had recommended to mercy, and that they had
made up their, minds not to “pot” another prisoner
that session.
It often happens that when juries obviously
do their best to come to a just conclusion the
lawyers display contempt for their elrorts.
In Thompson v. the N.S.W. Branch of the
B.M.A. a jury found that the B.M.A. had
conspired to expel Dr. Thompson, had used
threats to prevent other doctors from con-
sulting with him, and had defamed him. The
Full Court said, in effect, that the jury was
grossly in error —that Dr. Thompson and
not the B.M.A. was to blame: —
There was evidence before the jury of such a
degree of recklessness on the plaintiff’s part in the
making of those imputations and of evasions in
assuming responsibility for them that no reason-
able man could come to the conclusion that the
plaintiff was being harassed over matters of small
importance.
Although lawyers, both on the bench and
off it. are the first to proclaim that juries
are liable to be mentally incapable of weigh-
ing the evidence in a case which is at all
involved, and that even where competent they
are frequently corrupt, yet no official body,
such as a Bar Council or Law Institute, is
ever found demanding that this grave public
wrong shall be redressed. Primarily, the
explanation is, of course, that the Law is
the most conservative of the professions. But
there is another, and it influences, to a cer-
tain extent, even the most high-minded.
The jury system —a system under wffiicli the
arbitrament in a matter involving hundreds
of thousands of pounds may be in the hands
of a financially embarrassed land-agent, an
uneducated builder, a political or religious
crank and a racing crook —makes for un-
certainty ; and uncertainty is the life-blood
of every lawyer’s banking account. For an
analogous reason professional malefactors
cling to the principle of juries of 12 in
criminal trials. With 12 men drawn from a
numOie nnuncial class it is a poor and unen-
terprising oiiender who cannot hope to buy
a disagreement in the form of one juror ; and
then there are the many other possibilities
—that a juror may be attracted by the de-
fender or antagonised by the Judge, or that
he may disapprove of gaol or approve of
crime., Vv ithout juries and the procrastinat-
ing humbug and bombast which they pro-
voke, litigation on the civil side might be cut
down as regards time by four-finths. With
jurors of a higher mental calibre than are
available under the Jury Act’s exemption
clauses, the present waste of time should, in
both courts, be halved, and the likelihood of
justice being done would certainly be doubled,
imagine a Sydney special jury, consisting of
an archbishop, a great surgeon, the manager
of the Bank of N. S. Wales and the head-
master of Sydney Grammar School. It would
not only provide the intelligence and probity
requisite for the consideration of a compli-
cated commercial dispute, but it would dis-
courage the long-drawn-out foolery that
advocates find paying business when dealing
with juries of an inferior quality. And the
same applies in criminal matters. There is
no justification, barring the mediaeval law of
privilege, for eminent citizens to be excused
from jury service; and the reasons why they
should serve ar.e cried aloud at every Court
sittings, civil and criminal. By the present
look of things, if the moral and intellectual
standard of juries is not raised before long
by the* infusion of new blood, the lawyers
will wake up one day to find that their best
friend has been done away with by Parlia-
ment.
The Use of Hospitals.
About the Speck’s persistent hospital trouble:
The most significant sentence in the just-published
report oi the Commission on Hobart Hospital man-
agement reads: “The members of the association
lii.M.A.l have, in evidence and by their counsel,
expressed a strong desire to now associate with the
hospital.’’ It thus appears that after a three years’
virtual boycott of the hospital, the B.M.A. doctors
have called the strike off. It has been a long dis-
pute, and not without its bitter moments. First,
the B.M.A. honoraries, who had for years practically
run the hospital, took exception to the increasing
number of well-to-do patients seeking hospital treat-
ment, the contention being, in effect, that the fat
purses of the affluent were, and ought to remain, the
legitimate prey of the medical practitioners in their
private practice, the sustenance derived from that
source enabling the doctors to give their spare time,
in an honorary capacity, to the hospital, which should
shelter only patients requiring free, or nearly free,
treatment. The Hospital Board took the view that,
as the hospital was almost wholly supported by the
State, every taxpayer had a right to treatment there-
in, at such fees as he could reasonably afford. The
B.M.A. doctors then “went out,” leaving the Hos-
pital Board and the Government, and, incidentally,
the hospital patients, in a serious difficulty. After
a few days’ anxiety and search for a qualified medi-
cal staff, the authorities discovered Dr. V. Ratter
and made him surgeon-superintendent;, with the
right of private practice as a consultant. The new
man was a success from the start, and, with the
assistance of a .small but competent staff, soon made
his surgical skill and the efficient conduct of the
hospital the talk of the island. This was no good
to the 8.M.A., for most of the operation cases were
going to the hospital (nearly 3000 last year), and
Dr. Ratten was gaining more experience in a week
than the average practitioner could hope to get in
a year. The next move was to question the validity
of Ratten’s diploma in *the law courts, but -appa-
rently because of the difficulty of tracing the prin-
cipals of an American Medical College which had
gone out of business soon after issuing Dr. Ratten’s
diploma, the Supreme Court’s verdict, though against
the appellants (nominally the Medical Board, but
presumably the 8.M.A.), was not generally accepted
as quite conclusive. The Tasmanian Parliament
then passed an Act validating Dr. Ratten's diploma
—probably the first time in history that a Parlia-
ment has assumed the functions of a Board of Medi-
cal Examiners.
According to evidence given before the Commis-
sion the surgeon-superintendent and his staff have
since been subjected to the usual treatment accorded
“strike-breakers,” including, of course, social ostra-
cism by the B.M.A.’s friends and supporters. These
latter, however, failed to convince the Commissioners
that a return to the old system of control by honor-
aries would be the best thing that could happen
to patients. Moreover, the few witnesses who set
out with the evident intention of “making things
warm” for Dr. Ratten and his management were
overshadowed by the cloud of patients and ex-patients
and nurses that rushed in to testify on the other
side.
Tiie imbroglio seems likely to end in a sort of
compromise, which will give the B.M.A. doctors the
right of filling three honorary positions (a fresh
three to be selected every two years), with second-
ary control over a certain number of cots. But
the surgeon-superintendent is to retain actual con-
trol and full power to intervene in ease of urgent
necessity, whether the honoraries like it or lump
it. If this proposal is finally accepted, the hospital
staff will comprise three resident doctors, three
honoraries, and sundry visiting specialists. The
salary cost is estimated at the moderate figure of
£2050 —superintendent £B5O, first assistant £6OO,
junior assistant £250, sundry specialists, say, £350.
But the settlement of the trouble can have little
effect on the general question of hospital control.
The State’s batch of about a dozen hospitals are now
almost wholly Government responsibilities, and their
cost to the taxpayers is increasing every year.
The old honorary staffing of hospitals is deservedly
in disfavor, and is not likely to be reverted to.
Special collections on Hospital Days are also in dis-
favor, the public regarding such collections as a
special tax on the benevolent and a dashed nuisance.
Bequests to hospitals, like other voluntary aids, are
seldom heard of these times. It looks as though
the only way to secure efficiency is to make the
Government’s control and responsibility complete.
The inevitable extra cost will probably have to be
raised, so far as Tasmania is concerned, by a special
hospital tax. This will, of course, hit" some people;
others will actually pay less than they do under the
present haphazard system.
Of all schemes tried in Australia the one employed
at Broken Hill, and capable of much wider applica-
tion, seems to have given the best results. There,
under a special amendment of the Truck Act, every
employer was authorised to deduct from every
employee’s wages a small fortnightly sum which
he (the employer) subsidised; and every contributor
entitled to the use of the hospital. If anyone
•.-.anted more than ordinary hospital treatment he
could get it by paying for it within certain limits.
Kot the least gsod feature of the scheme was that the
cost of collecting the tax was almost nil; and it is
safe to say that thousands of contributors never knew
they were paying it.
What of Zion?
From the writeiv of the article
“Schnorrer’s” comments (B. 10/4/’23) on “The
Slump in Zionism” strike me as hypercritical, tp put
it mildly. He says: “It is true that the Jews who
are epmfortably placed in English-speaking countries
do not want to go to Palestine” —as though I had speci-
fied that British and American Jews were avoiding
the national home any more than, sa.v, German or
French Jews. What I said was that Judaism (i.c.,
Jews generally) had not responded to the Palestine
call; and the setting forth by “Schnorrer” of the
numerical proportions of those nationalists that did
respond in no wise changes, my view. The last cen-
sus showed that there were about 83,000 Jews'in all
Palestine. Before the war the commonly-accepted
figure was 100,000 for the Mutessarifat of Jerusalem:
William Grant, editor of Glad Tidings, and an en-
thusiast Zionist, several times mentioned 100,000 as
the pre-war Jewish population when he was in Aus-
tralia a few months ago. But, says “Schnorrer,”
Jewish authorities complain that the census was
very wrong,” implying that the figures have been
faked by “those fanatics who froth at the very
name of Jew'.” Now, the present Palestine Govern-
ment has as its official advisory body a Zionist Com-
mission, and one of the causes of Arab hostility is
the immense preponderance of Jews in the Govern-
ment service. In short, the last census was virtually
taken by Jews. For the previous one, which credited
Judaism with a 20,000 bigger population than it has
in Palestine to-day; Moslem officials were largely
responsible.
As a counter to my statement that the Hebrew
immigrants the national home has attracted so far
have been “chiefly unemployables and Bolsheviks,"
“Schnorrer” remarks: “There may be some ‘Redness’
amongst them, but it is not likely, since the ‘Red’
who renounces his Judaism can be prosperous in
Soviet Russia or elsewhere.” As against tliis piece
of stay-at-home speculation, let me quote Archdeacon
Stacy Waddy, who has been living in Palestine :
Any Australian w’ho found himself back in the
country where he scorched and froze, went thirsty
and watched spider-fights in the great Allenby cam-
paign, would feel pretty' disgusted at the state of
affairs he would find there. Everyone “speaking out
of his turn” ; Jews expressing anything but gratitude
to the British; and with a strong Bolshevik element.
The Colonial Office, ever gradual, has only' just pub-
lished the report of the Commission (Sir Thomas
llaycroft, Chief Justice of Palestine; H. C. Luke,
Assistant-Governor of Jerusalem ; and J. N. Stubbs)
appointed by the High Commissioner for Palestine
to inquire into the Jaffa riots last May. The Com-
mission found that the immediate cause was “an
unauthorised demonstration of Bolshevik Jews,” which
brought about a battle w’ith “an authorised demon-
stration of the Jewish Labor party'.” The Commis-
sion cites a number of factors contributing to the
anger felt by the local Moslems against Zionism,
amongst them this: —
Ow’ing to insufficient precautions, immigrants of
Bolshevik tendencies have been allowed to enter the
country, and these persons have endeavored to intro-
duce social strife and economic unrest into Palestine,
and to propagate Bolshevik doctrines.
I agree with “Sciinorrer’s” claim that “the Jewish
organisations are doing really marvellous work, Stag-
nant swamps have been drained; what seemed deserts
have been planted with trees, irrigation works estab-
lished,” etc. But they are not doing it unaided;
and it is not perpetrating an injustice against a
race which is eminent enough in the arts, in com-
merce and in finance to forbear from claiming quali-
ties it never has possessed, to say that it could not
do these things unaided. The following is from H. S,
Gullett’s fine book, “Sinai and Palestine,” and
though he is referring to the summer of 1918, it
gives a fairly accurate picture of wliat is going on
still: —
Within a few' hours of its occupation Jerusalem
was transformed from the most unsavory city in the
world into a clean and fragrant town. Allenby V
engineers found time to develop the ancient water-
supply at Solomon’s pools, and also to revive and bring
into operation after centuries of idleness the old flow
in the Wady Arrub, farther south on the Hebron-road,
which had been drawn upon by Pontius Pilate. At
the same time Englishmen, drawn from all parts of
the world where there is British rule over native
peoples, w;ere pushing, wdth that splendid tact and
capacity which marks such bodies as the Indian Civil
Service, into all the occupied villages.
It is that kind of work which, I submit, Jews in
the mass cannot, and will not, do. If they ever dis-
play a taste and aptitude for it, Zion will automat-
ically begin to boom; for admittedly no colony' in
the world’s history ever started out with such pros-
pects in the way of moral and financial encourage-
ment. But on all the evidence the time is not y r et.
White Australia’s Inconsistency.
From a Pacific island: —
Recent reported actions- in Sydney give rise to the
thought that the White Australia ideal is not very
deeply ingrained in some of its adherents.
It was only to be expected that the sight in city
streets of an extra-tall Englishman, with a diminu-
tive South Sea Island native garbed in a scarlet
loincloth, would attract glances. But it might be
and ought to be expected of Australian citizens
that interest would end there. It is uncom-
fortable, therefore, to hear this Englishman boast
of the way in which he and his indentured servant—-
whom, of course, he introduced as a prince—were
feted and courted, with Petu (the “prince”) as the
star attraction. One daily newspaper, published an
interview- with him, in which he expressed his
opinions of white girls and the amount of make-up
they use. A weekly pillar of respectability and
strong Australian sentiments published his photo.
The photographer who took the photos begged free
acceptance of tinted pictures on condition that he
was allowed to make a: window-show of studies of his
“royal” patron. Business is alleged to have been
held up in one of Sydney’s largest shops while the
“prince” condescended to patronise the white girls
who fawned over “the sweet little pet.” Even
theatrical managers, when favored with an introduc-
tion to Petu, immediately found some way of giving
him a seat -in the front row of their theatres. Hav-
ing to call at a city post office for a parcel, Petu
and his master found themselves further back in a
queue facing the delivery-window’ than they cared
for. Forcing their way round to some private en-
trance, they contrived to reach the manager’s room,
where-—to use their own expression—the officials of
the White Australian Government “immediately fell
for Petu.” While the heads were -fussing over him,
a minion was despatched' to obtain- the parcel. The
mere White Australians were still standing outside
the wdndow.
Probably few who came in contact wdth Petu
would know that he was merely a prohibited
Kanaka immigrant, and could only enter the Com-
monwealth on the strength of a £lOO bond that he
would leave it again within a prescribed time. While
no one can reasonably object to a certain amount
of hospitable fuss being made over distinguished
visitors to Australia, the white man's prestige is
lowered dangerously among native races when any
ordinary Kanaka can return to his island and tell

of a fuss of the foregoing character being made over
him in white-man cities.
Those whom Petu honored will no doubt appre-
ciate a little information about their patron “prince’s”
family history. Sad to say, he belongs to a family
with no trace of royalty about it. -It is notorious,
however, for the alleged possession of the evil eye.
While. Petu was achieving notoriety in Sydney, his
father was havirg another brand of it thrust on him
in his island home. It came about in this way.
Some few years back a missionary elevated nis
cook-boy and a laborer to the dignity of
great chiefs, and took them with him on a sympathy-
enlistirg, money-collecting tour of Australia and
Maoriland. White Christian ladies vied with each
other in their efforts to serve the “chiefs.” Warm
baths, beds with sheets on, and tasty meals served
at the table were prepared for the distinguished (and
astonished) visitors,, who were used to sleeping on a
mat spread on a wooden bench, and eating taro
or rice from the kerosene-tin in which it was cocjktd.
These two natives came from an island where it is
customary for the ladies to court the gentlemen who
take their fancy. It was not long before one if
them decided that the same custom ‘prevailed every-
where, and, as he thought they were all courting
him, he had to be bundled back home before worse
happened. The other native managed to keep his head
and spent a couple of years collecting the thrip-
pences of the faithful before he returned to his
mission station, where his work was that of a
teacher and preacher. About six months ago he
had a row with Petu’s father. He took ill a few
days afterwards, and in a couple more was dead.
In spite of his education he is said to have died
declaring that Petu’s father had put the evil eye
on him. While Petu was beirg fussed over in Syd-
ney the cook whom his emiloyer had left at the -
island home died. Once more Petu’s father forced
himself into the limelight. His boasts that he had
caused the death of the cook boy, as well as that
of the mission boj r some months earlier, were so
loud that they reached the ears of Government. The
result has been a heavily-fined old gentleman, who,
if he repeats his performance in the next five years,
is likely to be put where he will have less chance
of doing mischief.
The islands of the Pacific aro a source of economic
and strategic interest to Australia. It is likely
that more and more white men will work among
them. Such stupidities as those of which Sydney
was recently guilty make their difficulties infinitely
great and their lives vastly less safe. Incidentally,
Australians make themselves very ridiculous.
Theodore the Winner.
Although the Labor vote was little, if any-
thing, greater in the aggregate than the non-
Labor vote, Theodore, the Queensland Pre-
mier, has been returned with a majority
which must far exceed his rosiest antic pn-
tions. It seems likely , that he will own 42
of the 72 seats in the next Parliament, and
he may have more. This result —unprece-
dented in the case of an Australian party
completing its eighth year of power—is attri-
butable in part to a redistribution of seats
which couldn’t have worked out more
favorably for the crowd in office if it had
been drawn up in caucus, and to the rolls
being crowded with scores of thousands of
names which" had, no right to be there. An-
other point is that seats were wrested from
the Opposition by the votes of railway-con-
struction workers, who will have hit the
track for other electorates in a few months.
But a large contribution to the victory
was made by the Premier himself. Whereas
the other s'de was divided into two more or
less unfriendly groups led by persons deficient
in all the qualities that inspire enthusiasm,
Theodore stood before the public the com-
pelling leader of a solid party in which he
had borne down all opposition. Under a
'•aptain of the Dooley or McGirr brand
Queensland Labor would have crashed as
badly as N. S. Wales Labor d : d last year.
But Queenslanders rallied to the man who
(as he related at the Emu Park Convenpon)
told the Government servants that they
would have to take a 5 p.c. reduction or get
other jobs, and informed the protesting
Labor delegates that if they didn’t like it
they could put someone in his place.
Theodore satisfied the popular craving for
leadership. The polling ind’eates that the
great majority of those who suffered by his
“deflation” policy voted for him, which
means, if it means anything, that Labor
voters have a greater regard for the kind of
leader who will stand up aga’pst them when
he thinks they are wrong than for the olea-
ginous sort that leads them from behind and
behaves as if they are always right. In
fact, the leading truth revealed by the elec-
tion is that Queensland will take almost any-
thing from, and forgive almost everything
to, a political chief who has won its admira-
tion and proved that he is ready to put his
fortune to the touch on a matter of policy
which he considers vital. Another arresting
feature is the poor figure cut bv the so-called
United party, which is merelv “Nat:on<d-
ism” in its latest and feeblest d''sguise. The
comparative success of the Cookies in most
adverse circumstances shows that they will
in future be the backbone of th n opposition
to Labor. And not in Queensland alone.
When Lord Roberts, who knew, though he
was old and weary, stumped, the country
praying England to train its youth, he asked
for, nothing but. the Australian system. The
refusal had much to do with the bloodiest
war in history, for undoubtedly it was the
knowledge that Britain’s masses didn’t know
the butt end of a rifle from tfle muzzle that
encouraged Germany to make the dash on
Paris. Part of the Australian training-
scheme dealt with the boys in elementary
schools, part.culaiiy those between the ages
of 12 and 15. Teachers attended instruc-
tional classes for a fortnight, their bare ex-
penses being paid by the Gommonwealch. On
obtaining eert-ficates of effic.ency they re-
turned to their pupils. Youngsters were
taught to stand squarely, to obey promptly,
to become expert in scientifically-framed
exercises, to. master squad drill. District
inspectors, aga.n without fees, examined on
the work and reDorted. Tins went on m
thousands of schools where there were boys
over 12. Slackness meant “Please expla n ’
from Directors of Education. First-class
work meant the gift by the Commonwealth
of a tug-of-war rope or some simple gymnas-
tic appliances. That was the total cosc of the
scheme —that and the trifling expense of the
fortnight’s training. There was no uniform,
no blood and thunder; the lad was simply
stiffened up, his muscles strengthened to
enable him to walk instead of slouch, to hold
his head up, to souare his shoulders. At the
end of the war —A theie was an end—the
foundation of the structure was kicked away
by the Government on the plea of economy.
Inspectors burnt their supply of report-
sheets. Teachers, honorary in all cases, and
trained to the work, disgustedly left the job,
and specialised in large numbers of cases in
THE CUSTARD PIE.
“The Victorian Pastry Cooks’ Union has decided to dispense with all union bosses and officials; the
affairs of the union to be administered by a council of twelve.”
THE PASTRY COOK: “Go and get work!”
fox-trotting. And now our future soldiers
are reverting to slouch and slump. Surely
it was worth a few footballs, ropes, horizon-
tal bars and the like to have every Austra-
lian youngster over 12 trained in those
elementary exei’cises that make healthy,
robust citizens as well as hard sold'ers. But
the whole thing was too inexpensive, too
practical and effective to suit a Government
with an eye only for grandiose schemes.
An MS. found in a fruit case:—-
A cry has gone up from the city press that fruit
pools should be abolished. God help the industry ii
they are. I am a shareholder in a co-operative can-
ning co. which decided to stand out of the 1921 pool.
That year’s balance-sheet showed a huge loss. The
co. paid the growers a mere £5 per ton for their
fruit, promising a further payment up to pool prices
when stocks were realised. This promise, owing to
heavy losses, it was unable to fulfil. Two items
from the latest balance-sheet tell their own story.
Wages paid for the pack amounted to £26,321, most
of the money being earned during the processing
season, lasting about 12 weeks. But the fruitgrowers
received no more than £19,799, and out of this they
had to foot their bills for pruning and burnirg off,
spraying (several operations), manures, cultivating,
water and municipal rates, rents, picking, cartage,
horsefeed, shoeing, eases, and the ccsts of living for
one year. On our settlement there are about 309
growers, mostly married men with families. A . large
proportion are returned soldiers. Without drastic
cuis in the cost of produc.ion (and 1 suppose that
means strikes, among other things) and' heavily
reduced freights on wheels and ships, or, in the alter-
native, some system of price-fixii.g for home toi s-mo-
tion, it looks as if we shall have to swarm down to
the city and sell raeebooks for a living, if there are
no vacancies on the trams or in the police.
■ - ♦
Governments and other loan-issuing bodies
in .Australia have hitherto fixed a last day
for receiving applications, and if (as rarely
happened) they nad too much money offered,
they made their allotments on a basis settkd
by themselves. The other day the N.S.W.
State Savings (Ruiai) Lank hud four times
more offered than it wanted ; and people w ho
asked for more .than £5OO had anyth mg up
to 90 per cent, of their application, cheques
returned to them. The pian is, open to
ser.ous objections, and has generally been
abandoned elsewhere. In London and other
great centres the list closes when it is full.
If your application is accepted you know
that you Will be allotted all you have asked
for; and you know it will be accepted if you
turn up early. Working on the other plan
the borrowing body puts investors to the
trouble and expense of realis.ng short-term or
other investments, and then may inform them
that it doesn’t want their money, which means
that they have the trouble and expense c f re-
investing it. If is safe to say that, if to-
morrow the Rural Bank issued another pros-
pectus in the same terms as the last, it would
not get half, perhaps not one-fourth, the
offers; and later on this disincF nation to
make a gamble of a matter of hard invest-
ment may produce an actual fiasco.
•
“Hori” : The no-liability attitude of the
Queensland railways in respect to goods con-
signed to small stations at which there is
no goods-shed or stationmaster (and there
are many such in the sparsely-populated Out-
back) is the limit in public-service auto-
cracy. On the Great Northern Railway, and
its branches especially, goods disappear with
monotonous regularity. Consignees of gro-
cei’ies and drapery are the worst sufferers,
but such an article as a ton of barbed wire
has been known to vanish from a railway
truck overnight and leave no ti’ace behind it.
It would be a 2 to 1 chance against a case
of whisky reaching its destination. More
often than not goods lost disappear en route;
and. though the consignee may be waiting
at the station to receive them, and though
they figure on the guard’s way-bfll, a claim
for compensation always brings forth the same
reply: “The Commissioner will not be re-
sponsible for the number or condition of
the packages consigned.” etc. Th : s stand
taken by the Department naturally fosters
in the emp’ovees an “I don’t give a d -”
attitude. Apparently all that the thief has
to be careful about is that he attacks only
the goods consigned to a no-liability station
—that is to say, a pioneering station. I pre-
sume this is another way in which the Gov-
ernment encourages settlement.
Thus a S. African in Australia: —
Robert Brothers’s article (B. 3/5/’23) entitled
“The Australian Abroad” is misnamed. It should
be “An Australian at Sea.” Trying to account for
what he alleges is the Australian’s unpopularity in
S. Africa he says that, first, the British officer libelled
the Australian for not saluting him during the
time of the Boer War. I do not remember hearing
of anyone being shot, for this crime. For 14 years
I have dodged in and out of the Potchefstroom mili-
tary cantonments, for sports, etc., without hearing
of the libel. Nor did I hear anything said that
would have caused a fight. The subject of Australia
and her non-saluting soldiers interested nobody. My
greatest friend of 20 years’ standing was an Aussie.
1 remember two captains (a Lancer and an R.F.A.)
sending my pal two cases of whisky, addressed to
“that splendid fellow , with compliments,”
Shades of Bacchus! that’s the sort of libel one appre-
ciates. Again he says: “The middle class of English
and Welsh have begrimed us.” After 20 years in
the country I never struck any of these begrimers.
Three other good Aussie friends of mine never com-
plained that their kith and kin had been set upon
or suffered any kind of torture. Good Mr. Brothers
has discovered a mare’s nest. Let us hope he does
not sit and hatch out more wonderful myths.
“Old Grammar” : I never had any of the
small boy’s idolatry for tlie big fellows who
upheld the schools alleged honor in various
games. It was my misfortune as a. juvenile
to sit next to a hulking mass of muscle
who pulled stroke in the school boat, and
was so mediocre at lessons that he had no
compunction in cribbing from me. Hero-
worship soon diminishes under these condi-
tions, and when the lout left—-he would never
have been allowed to stay so long but for
his strength with an oar —I didn’t share in
the general misery at his departure. Later
on, when I got up a bit, I was in the same
form with another glorious athlete of finer
character, but so petted by the form-master on
account of his brilliancy in football that I
and other youngsters were made to feel as
if we were in the presence of a god. Adam-
son. Wesley’s headmaster, has said (B.
10/5/’23) some hard things about the growth
of sport in the schools, but what have he
and his brother-heads done to keep it in its
proper place? Games play a bigger part in
the curricula than ever, and the parents of
boys who are not dominated by sporting in-
stincts and really go to school to learn a
few things have to part up in sports fees to
keep the lustier lads in materials. I can’t
help noticing that, unlike Adamson, the
other heads, who probably realise the hypoc-
risy of the situation, are wise enough to keep
their mouths shut.
The quaint delusion that because a talkative
man can hold on to a portfolio or a trapeze
longer than the average he must be priceless
as a newspaper contributor evolved both
Lloyd George and Hughes. Lloyd George
gets no better, and Hughes gets worse. His
outpouring re “Our Unique Empire’’ (Syd-
ney Telegraph ) was a masterpiece of the
loud noise that means nothing. For instance:
“The British Commonwealth of Nations...v
is not confined to any one continent or even
to one hemisphere.” But that doesn’t make
it unique. Nations which butt into three
continents and both hemispheres include
France, Holland and Portugal. Nations
which spread into two continents include
Turkey, Russia, Italy, Spain and Belgium.
Further:—
The 'Empire is united only because every member
of it is absolutely free.
Absolute freedom necessarily includes the
right to quit.at will; and that right is for-
mally recognised nowhere, not even in Ire-
land. In Australia petty and long-winded
tyrants even deny the freedom of a solvent,
loyal community of white men like those of
northern N. S. Wales to manage their own
affairs within the Empire. So far from
being free to quit the Empire, they are told
that they may not even separate from Syd-
ney. Yet these are the fine sound ng phrases
with which a < fluent talker can build up a
great reputation. And under our system of
government only that type of man reaches
the. place where he can administer the
nation’s business affairs. The mere thinker
and the man of action have no chances at all.

“Sucre”: I d dn’t infer, “Alkaloid” (B.
3/5/23) notwithstanding, that dear sugar
is due to the introduction of white labor.
That bogey is merely the invention of the
southern jam industry. Melbourne doesn't
care whether it gets its white sugar “black”
or otherwise, as long as it gets it for 3d. or
thereabouts. Australia’s sugar trouble : s an
echo of Cuba’s —nothing more or less. There
“raws” are selling at 6|d. lb. The U.S.A.
Department of Justice has slipped the band-
age off one of its eyes, and peered into the
doings of the New York Coffee and Sugar
Exchange. An orgy of “paper” transactions
and speculations in “raws” was disclosed,
and an injunction has been la'd on the front
doorstep of the speculators. Cuba is a black
man’s paradise, yet spot sugar is quoted
6|d. lb. What has Melbourne to say about
that?

POLITICAL
POINTS
An eleventh-hour “purification” of the
beautiful Queensland rolls made the electoral
quota 6526. This was exceeded in all ex-
cept five of the 27 constituencies in which
Opposition candidates were leading at the
moment of writing, and the whole five were
only 1198 electors short. Thus Mirant had
147 less than the quota, Wide Bay 195,
Aubignv 197, Burnett 216 and Lockyer 443.
But, bv an exquisitely appropriate coinci-
dence, 27 of-the 45 electorates with l abor
majorities had less than the quota, and in
many cases the deficiency was substantia*.
In Flinders, Mullan’s seat, it was 2759, in
Queenton 1780, in Charters Towers 1 • 74. m
Cook 1837, in Chillagoe (Theodore sits for
Chillagoe) 1692, in Townsville. 1430, in
Gregory 1334, in Gympie 1231, m Balonne
1229. in Mt. Morgan (Stopfords liieum-
benev) 1054, and in Eacham (which belongs
to Gillies) 930. And that’s how we won
the war.
Some days before the Queensland elect'ons
everybody in the know realised that tbe
Theodore Government was safe and the
cackle of the Ministry’s henchmen was loud
and triumphant. The assurance came when
it was known that 58,332 new voters had
been found inside 2-| years, and that 98,000
people (reduced to 64,000 by last-moment
‘"erasures”) were on the roll whom the F ederal
Registrar couldn’t find anywhere. The
Queensland Labor party has become a dis-
astrous loser at its own Federal and mum-
cipal elections. But it is a perfect daisy
for winning where it makes up the rolls itse 1.
The northern (Newcastle) miners’ spokes-
men scoff at the claim of the owners that
they must have the right to dismiss the work-
men that don’t suit them. If the unions
agree with this —and presumably they d
they will, of course, in future forego the*r
own right to sack any union offic’al or Far-
fiamentary representative who doesn t suit
them. Hitherto they haven’t had much com-
punction about kicking out anybody who
hasn’t satisfied them —Dooley, for instance
—but that, according to the new claim, is
all wrong.
“Gallery” on a Childe Roland act: —
The small squad of unsuccessful office-hunters
amorg Bruce’s direct followers is frequently magni-
fied into an army ready to tear the Government to
pieces and eat the fragments raw. The other day
a Melbourne paper spoke darkly of the “discontent”
in the Nationalist party, and there were hints _r f
secret meetings and of pikes and billhooks being
sharpened. Personally I haven’t discovered anything
remotely resembling a threat against Bruce and
Page, though it is quite possible to imagine from
the expressions of some members that they are
thinking of starting a branch of the Ku Klux Klan.
There is, for instance, Dash, a furtive character at
any time, and proud to be elevated to the position
of a conspirator by some reporter hungry for copy;
but Dash is no header of forlorn hopes, and his talk
of rebellion is so much hot air. Moreover, the
brooding look on his face has generally no political
origin. It is frequency due to some fancied horse
failing to catch the judge’s eye. It is easy to regard
these humbugs as Gunpowder Plotters, for they love
to talk to the press and have their office-hunger
misinterpreted as a patriotic desire to rid the coun-
try of a gang of loafers, or worse. Every Govern-
ment in power is for a time the worst possible
affliction to the man who has failed to become a
member of it.
After all, it was really the Denham Min-
istry which began the work of resuscitating
the cotton industry in Queensland by makirg
an advance of per lb. and undertaking
to g,n it. Prices were low then, and the
ultimate return to the farmer (l|d. per lb.)
aroused little enthusiasm. Still, Denham g,t
the business going. Then the U.S. cotton
export fell off through local demands and ihe
boll-weevil, and the price went up. and the
British Cotton Growing Association per-
vaded the Empire imploring people to grow
cotton and get rich, and Federal assistance
was thrown in, and prices went up so much
more that it seemed safe to guarantee 5 Id.
per lb. Even the Theodore Government
couldn’t prevent the industry expanding a
little in a fertile State where there were so
many unemployed to provide labor, and
where the proportion of land under ciop was
the smallest in the six States, in proportion
both to area and to population.
Laffer, Repatriation Minister in S.A., ha 3
had the courage to tell a returned sold-ers’
deputation, headed by Col. Charlie Butler,
that in finance they have been given a “rat-
tling good time”: —
When you ask for more concessions, you should
remember that somebody has got to pay for them,
anil this somebody is the taxpayer. Costs are now
so high that we must seriously consider whether we
shall not stop building houses. You boys know you
would rot sell youf houses to-day for what they cost
to build.... You are enjoying, I don’t say more
thaii you are entitled to, but concessions which are
very ample. You have got a better deal in this
State, by far, than soldiers in any other State.
And Butler admitted, as to the last claim:
“I have sa d that right through.” Speaking
generally, the only men we are not treating
as well as we should are those who suffered
THE INCOME-TAX WORM.
THE FEDERAL ROOSTER : “I’ve got such good news for you. Instead of dividing you be-
tween us, I’m going to let my brother here, the State rooster, have you all to
himself —unless you're a very fat worm, and then, of course, I’ll have to help
him.”
war-damage; and perhans the worst of these
are the “gas cases.” It was thought at first
that all but a few of them would quickly get
back to normal; but a large proportion of
them have not and never will —hundreds of
them have developed T. 8., and hundreds of
others don’t know what horrors the future
holds for them. The man who has lost a
limb or an eye at least krows the worst;
the victims of the gas devilishness still live
in a hell of apprehension.
“The Arcadian”: Despite “Noah” the
Navigation Act, as representing a uniform
Federal control of shipping matters., has a
good deal to its credit. The following are
things that might have been done but were
not done until the Commonwealth took a
hand in maritime affairs: (1) Compulsory
wireless on board ships over 1600 tons or
carrying more than 12 passengers. (2) The
establishment of a cyclone-warning station
on Willis Island. (3) The establishment
of savings banks within offices where seamen
are paid their wages. (4) The provision of
decent accommodation on board ships trad-
ing around the roast. As so often happens,
the men who “only want to be left alone”
made it impossible to leave them alone be-
cause they failed to do things which obvi-
ously should be done.
If Prime Minister Bruce had had a year’s
early training as a bush alderman he might
not have blotted his bright young career with
a quaint mistake. When he descended into,
the aldermanic * arena with his promise of
£500,000 for road-making he probably thought
he was doing something great; but N.S.W.’s
share of the glittering prize is, after all, only
£141,150. and at Lane Cove, in the Ma
State. £60.000 is being spent on repairing
Of miles of highway alone. To present an
allegedly rich State with about 15 miles of
road-patching wasn’t worth while. Unless
the Government specifies where its gift is to
be spent it will doubtless lie laid out in or
around the big cities. Then the country
districts which help to find the money will
take an interest in Bruce and rise up and
call his name Blanky.
The Federal figures of the Acres Under
Crop for Each 1000 People haven’t been
brought past 1921 yet; still they are very
interesting:—
S. Australia . . 6578 i N. S. Wales . . 2135
Westralia .. 5456 Tasmania .. 1397
Victoria .. 2938 | Queensland .. 1036
Queensland, urged by necessity and high
prices and a magnificent Government guar-
antee, has begun to grow cotton; yet the
total area under crops of all sorts was still
105,000 acres less in 1921 than in 1917.
South Aus. heads the list, of course, because
its crop is practically all wheat, and wheat
in Australia calls for astonishingly little
labor —a fact which, by the way, has to be
taken into account in comparing the average
yield per acre of this and other countries.
On a rough computation it takes four times
more labor to grow and harvest a bushel of
wheat in Britain than in any Australian
State.
A British coalminer and his young wife
and four little children were brought to
Maoriland as assisted imm grants. Within
a few days of h*s arrival the man d ed of
sp mil meningitis. Bereft of the bread-
winner, the widow, a stranger in a straLge
country, naturally desired to get back
to her own people, and an appeal was
made to the M.L. Immigration Department
for return passages. This being refused
information was sought as to the lowest
amount for which it would, carry the family
back to England if the widow could raise
the money herself. The Minister’s reply
was to the effect that the aggregate fares
would cost £B4, and the letter concluded:
“To th : s amount must be added the sum of
£56, which your passages to this country cost
the Government. This amount must be re-
funded to the Department before I can con-
sent to the issue of passports.” What fish-
like person was responsible for this?
In an article announcing that an attempt
is already being made to “white ant” the
Bruce-Page party and that the disgruntled
have met in conclave, Melbourne Age put it
gently:—
. Although Mr. Hughes was not present, members
who apparently speak with authority let it be
understood that the ex-Prime Minister would be
ready and willing to set himself at the head of
the movement if assurances were forthcoming that
it would have the support of a following sufficiently
large
How beastly superfluous! Who doubted that
Hughes would be “ready and willing” ?
Things don’t look any brighter for Dooley
because Pillans has been beaten in the elec-
tion for president of the Western Miners
Federation, at . AMWbOw
(N.S.W.). This body was Pillans s own toi
many years; and his friendship for DQOWy
and his influence with the miners had mucn
to do with Dooley’s hold on the electorate.
Besides having his gr:p on the leadersh p
of the N.S.W. Labor party, he now stands a
dismal chance of losing Ins seat.
From one day’s record in the Sydnej
dailies, and a quiet day at that:
Support was promised by Mr. Ball to a proposa)
for a tramway linking up Lane Cove with Dium-
n < Mr. e " Ball promised a deputation that the Rooty
Hill to Tahmoor railway wovld.be one ot the nrst
questions submitted to next Parliament.
Mr. Ball’s promises are supposed to be bind-
ing on the Government, for railways are m
his department. On the other hand the
vague assurances of Carruthers, M.L.0., are
not binding, for he doesn’t run the depart-
ment. So Ball promises lines about Sydney,
and Carruthers goes north holding ? u f
shadowy but friendly hopes that some kind
of tableland-to-co'ast connection will come
with the six-million loan. The Booty Hill
job will be 44 miles long, so it would bridge
about a third of the gap between the table-
land and a northern port. It is to connect
Rooty Hill. T Inline re and Tahmoor. Ihe
first is a hamlet on the western line, 25
miles from Sydney, and is also within shout-
ing distance of the Richmond line; the second
is a townlet on the old Southern line, and the
third is a sort of farmlet on the new Southern
line, which runs parallel a few miles away.
There has lately been a boomlet up that way,
and sales of “week-end res.dences. ’ ihe
new Ine will parallel both old and new
southern tracks for some distance. Loo
many jokelets like this may make the north-
erners, eternally waiting for the r connection
with the coast, either secede informally yet
firmly, or else throw gibbers at the next
Min.sterial piomiser.
Inasmuch as the Maffra (Vic.) sugar-beet
works were a white elephant for years, the
Government which runs them now waqts to
make sure before it installs new machinery.
Manager Williams recommended a remodel-
ling scheme and pointed to what he had seen
in U.S.A. The Ministry tried to induce
two Yankee experts to come to Australia to
advise, but they couldn’t get away, and now
there is a hunt a'fter a third. Seeing that
such a shrewd Scot as Allan McLean mis-
calculated at Mafra, McPherson thinks he
can’t be too careful. Still, one of the main
reasons for the Mgcallister irrigation scheme
was to induce people to grow more beet. Anu
a bigger beet yield I s worse than, useless if
there is insufficient plant to treat it.
The news that the huge meatworks at
Darwin, which began in 1917 and closed n
1920, are not going to resume, was only to
be expected. The : demand for as much as
565. per day for; a youth didn’t help the
industry, and as the same crowd is waiting
to renew it if the industry started again the
industry doesn’t start. The demand for
from Bs. 2d. to 16s. 4d. per hour for wharf-
lumping at N.Q. ports doesn’t help the
shipping industry either. The general atti-
tude of A.vV.U. bosses —at Darwin, anyhow
—has been that, in the absence of a railway,
competitive labor willing to work for a union
wage is someth'ng like three months away,
and won’t trouble to come. And competitive
labor doesn’t come.! The other point, is that
employment doesn’t stay.
The Bruce-l J ages are getting in some
energetic publicity work in preparation for
the Premiers’ Conference. All the proposals
that have been sent to the State Govern-
ments are handed out in homoeopathic doses to
the dailies, and the propaganda is : having its
effect on public opinion. Meantime the Vic-
torian Ministry is brooding on the fact that
the Country Liberals and the Cockies are
divided on the merits ol Bruce’s proposals.
Acting-Premier McPherson is expected to come
out strong at the conference in the State
Frights interest, but the diverse cries of
those who are keeping his team in power
(and would like to put it out of power if
they could make a compact) are chilling his
enthusiasm.
The Canadian Government also, owns a
shipping line of which it is a trifle tired.
It differs from the 'Australian one, inasmuch
as the loss, including depreciation, is an-
nounced each year. It was nearly half-a-
million last year. And it is worth noting
that there isn’t a Labor party in the Do-
minion Parliament. It doesn’t look as if
any sort of Government can make , a success
of these enterprises—in these democratic
days, at any rate.
Reported that rain has fallen in the Thar-
gomindah district for the first time in four
years. Young children who didn’t know
there was such a thing were scared, and old
dads said it reminded them of their youth.
Thar«-o. is so far out that it doesn’t affect
the life of Queensland much, but it was
through this region and worse regions beyond
that the Federal South-to-North railway was
to be deviated if Theodore could have per-
suaded Hughes to break faith and steal it
from South Aus.
THE CAPITALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wind in the Domain was strong and gusty;
So was the orator —dishevelled, dusty.
From a soap-box he bellowed his invective,
As though his listeners’ hearing was defective.
The old, old theme he tore almost to tatters —
The tyrant boss 1 What else in this world matters ?
Rude his remarks, with scraps of Marx to aid him.
The plutocrat!—if tongues could flay his flayed him!
Borne on the breeze the ancient gibes were uttered,
While all the “wage-slaves” round approval muttered.
“Comrades,” he roared —and here the wind grew
stronger.—
“Down-trodden toilers, stand the boss no longer!
Down with all Capital! Rise! Don’t be shirkers !
Long live the Proletariat—-us workers!”
Just here the wind’s behavior, wild, erratic,
Caused a diversion —an effect dramatic!
Whirled from afar, poor, homeless, lost and strayed
one,
A five-pound note —a genuine, new-made one —
Fell at the ranter’s feet. His eyes protruded;
Cold perspiration from his brow exuded.
A miracle! The word he’d hardly gasped it,
Before, within his fist, the note he’d grasped it.
Then rose a devilish snarl from all around him,
The mob went mad, his nearest “comrade” downed
him.
“Murder!” he yelled. Each “brother” was a strivor
To wrest from him by force the Heaven-sent fiver!
Waged the unequal fight for quite a minute,
And then the Law a hand (or two) took in it.
Bruised but triumphant, by the Johns escorted,
The Bolshy left the field —the mob was thwarted.
So damning him aloud, likewise his thesis,
The workers kicked their leader's box to pieces!

Until 1915 one lot of accounts showed all
C.S.R. operations; then the Fiji and Main-
land interests were transferred to a separate
co., created by issuing a trifle of 3j millions
of bonus capital, the C.S.R. holder receiv'ng
one free 6 p.c. pref. for every share held.
In February this year the “course of events
in Fiji” made it “desirable that the business
be again vested in the Australian c 0.,” and
the subsidiary is now in course of liquida-
tion. The true reasons which led to the
separation of interests, and the “course of
events” which prompted re-amalgamation,
are known only to those associated with
managing-director E. W. Knox in the inner
workings of the big concern. As no doubt
a Royal Commission would fail to eluci-
date these matters, The Bulletin is pre-
pared to await the Day of Judgment for en-
lightenment. Meanwhile, it is possible to
record some of the glittering results of the
splitting of the business and of its re-union.
In the introductory table the eight years’
results of the Fiji and Maoriland business
have been linked with the parent co.’s figures.
For the first three years of the separation
divs. on the parent’s ordinaries and on the
gift prefs. gave shareholders no more than
they had previously received in their 124
p.c. divs. from the Australian co. For 1919
the Australian div. was lifted from 64 p.c
to 74 p.c., and in the next year to 84 p.c.
Then £650,000 of capital was returned, and
a. 124 p.c. dividend on the parent’s re-
duced capital increased its annual distribu-
tions from £276,250 to £325 000. Meanwhile,
the Fiji was paying 6 p.c. regularly.
One result of the division of interests,
therefore, was that by 1921 shareholders,
who meanwhile were not called upon for
an extra penny of capital, were taking
£495,625 p.a. instead of £406 250 a few years
earlier, and the div. rates did not look obese.
But the larger distributions were only an
incident compared with subsequent happen-
ings. Having returned £650,000 of the
parent’s capital, allegedly because prospects
in Queensland had fallen to pieces, the man-
agement declared that Fiji was no longer the
happy hunting-ground it had appeared, and
it proceeded to return half of the 34 millions
of pref. capital. This was accompanied by
a cash bonus of 255. per share (£203,125).
Now the subsidiary is being liquidated, and
shareholders in the Australian co., which
held the whole of the £250,000 of Fiji and
M.L. ordinaries, are participating in a gor-
geous banquet. Managing-director E. W.
Knox has “instructed” liquidator E. W.
Knox to distribute portion of the balance
of assets transferable to the parent. The
liquidation div. has been fixed at £6 per
Australian share, and one-third of it.
(£325.000) is to be distributed in cash on
the 31st inst. The balance (£650,000) goes
to pay a call of £4 on the parent’s ordinaries,
replacing its return of capital in 1920. and
again making the £2O shares fully-paid and
restoring paid capital to 34 millions.
In the year at which the introductory
table opens, the co. was getting in the balance
of calls on 15,000 new shares. At the same
time the first .capitalisation of profits since
1888 (when apparently £50,000 was trans-
ferred) was undertaken. Disregarding the
early transfer, the actual cash-paid capital
in the business 15 years ago was £2,425.61)0,
and the co. was also working on £64,050 of
debentures. Not a penny has been got in
from shareholders since, and by 1915 the
whole of the debentures had been redeemed.
But by transfers of reserves, Avriting-up book
values and issuing bonus shares therefrom,
in 1916 the total scrip in the enterprise
amounted to 6| millions:—
1908 . . Cash-paid capital . . . . £2,425,000
1908-13 Parent’s bonus shares £825,000
1915 .. Subsidiary bonus shares 3,250,000
Total bonus shares .. .. 4,075,000
Total capital .. ..£6,500,000
And here is a record of capital repayments
and accompanying cash bonuses: —
1921 Parent co. .. . . £650,000
1921 Subsidiary co. .. .. 1,025,000
1923 Subsidiary co. . . . . 1,625,000
£3,900,000
1921 Subsidiary cash-bonus .. £203,125
1923 Subsidiary cash-bonus .. 325,000
528,125
Total refunds and bonuses ~ £4,428,125
During the past three years the co. has re-
turned £2.003,125 more than the £2,425,000
of capital which wa% invested in the enter-
prise. Besides having received regular hand-
seme divs. the old shareholder has had £36
10s. returned for every £2O paid for scrip, ai d
his original interest in the business is still
intact—in fact, in place of the £2,425,000
paid in, there will be scrip for £3 250,000
when the bonus call, provided from the
liquidation of the subsidiary, is credited on
August 4. It is not unlikely, by the way,
that the surplus cash resources of the parent
co. are playing an important part in the
cash distributions from the liquidation of
the Fiji and M.L. business. These calcula-
tions make it plain that the grower and con-
sumer have: (1) presented the entire under-
taking to proprietors; (2) given them the
whole of their capital back, together with
another £4 for every £5 invested; and (3)
contributed very 'fa't divs. How' large the
divs. have been is revealed by averaging dis-
tributions over periods. For the eight years
1908-15 the average return on cash-paid capi-
tal was p.c. p.a. For the seven years
following the establishment of the “bonus”
subsidiary, distributions averaged almost 18
p.c. p.a. on cash-paid capital, or, including
the cash bonus accompanying the 1921 return
of capital, a little more than 19 p.c. p.a.
The figures are the more astonishing be-
cause since the 1915 season the C.S.R. has,
to some extent, been under Government con-
trol in the Commonwealth. The co. has
been financially concerned only in refining:
it has acted as agent for the Commonwealth
Sugar Control, and has manufactured under
an agreement allowing so much for refining
and selling, plus • a managing charge of, gen-
erally, 20s. per ton. Though the co. is bit-
terly antagonistic to any form of Govern-
ment control, this arrangement has evidenFy
suited it admirably. In the 1915-16 season
10s. of the 20s. management charge was
voluntarily rebated by the co,, and for the
1916-17 season a lump sum of £60,000. These
concessions were, according to the co., re-
garded as “patriotic contributions.” Since
then it has pocketed the 20s. As recently
as October last five members of the Com-
monwealth Public Accounts Committee re-
ported :
To assess with entire accuracy the value of the ser-
vices rendered by the C.S.R., it would be necessary to
know the actual costs. No Royal Commission nor the
Public Accounts Committee has, as yet, been allowed
to see them. It is only reasonable to infer that if
these costs, taken in relation, to charges, showed only
a fair profit there would not be any difficulty in
revealing them.
That finding is the general impression of
most who have sifted the available evidence.
And, failing enlightenment from the co.
itself, what more evidence is required than
the figures in this review? Much of the fat-
ness of recent years has, of course, come
from operations outside the Commonwealth;
but the Australian results, as disclosed by
the published accounts, have not been lean.
In addition to visible reserves, which have
mounted from £52,019 to £926,715 since Sep-
tember, 1913, there is a reserve for deprecia-
tion and replacements which has expanded
from £500,000 to £1,023,174 within the same
period.
Some years ago the management claimed
that the excellent results which it was show-
ing were due to the policy of replacing bor-
rowed capital with fixed capital and to the
improvement of processes. In 1910 the
directors admitted that they had been regard-
ing their fixed capital in much the same way
as they would have treated borrowed capi-
tal : that is, a substantial layby was accumu-
lated to cover capital costs over a period.
In this way the Fiji business was practi-
cally paid for out of profits. That policy
appears to have been persisted in, and to have,
in part, accounted for recent happenings. The
procedure is not in any way justifiable. The
only obligation on a management handling
fixed capital is to safeguard that capital
with ample reserves for depreciation and
contingencies, and to earn reasonable divs.
Only a wealthy, cleverly-managed semi-mon-
opoly like the C.S.R. has opportunities to
do more. So far as factory-practice is con-
cerned, the management, judged by its own
published statements, appears 'to have
been under the delusion that it was under
no obligation to improve processes for the
benefit of the public, and that anything extra
it could earn in that way was its property
by divine right.
The summary of happenings in recent
years definitely establishes that the C.S.R. has
had its fingers too deeply in the sugar-pot,
and that profits have been far in excess of
what a co. handling a necessary commodity
should be permitted to earn. So far, it has
shied successfully at all attempts to curb
it. But its continued opulence is inviting
some form of regulation; and when that does
happen there probably won’t be concessions
such as the N. S. Wales gas cos. received.
So far as the shareholder is concerned, there
is always that threatening cloud in the
C.S.R. firmament. Meanwhile the co. is un-
fettered, and is apparently in an excellent
position to earn good divs. for 3J millions
of capital instead of the 6J millions of two
years ago, despite the doubts as to the
future of the co.’s business in Fiji, where
coolie labor has become less cheap and scarce.
But the dismal outlook there is trifling com-
pared with the black forebodings which have
been pictured in chairmen’s speeches in the
past, and, unless the C.S.R.’s very capable
managing-director has lost his punch. The
Bulletin won’t be surprised if the Fiji diffi-
culties soon fade away, as have all others.

This old co.—it held its 47th annual meet-
ing in London in March—was evidently hit
up for back-taxation during the past finan-
cial year. Recently it has been contributing
about £41,000 p.a.; during the past 12
months it had to pay out £84,627. The man-
agement dipped into a contingency reserve
for £30,000; nevertheless, the period had to
carry a burden £13,000 larger than usual,
and in those circumstances, and in view of
the fact that Maoriland has been recovering
from the after-effects of the war-boom, the co.
did well to show a profit of £21,043. That
was not sufficient to give 10 p c. on capital,
but the directors had no hesitation in taking
£3357 of the £8738 accumulated carry-
forward, because backing paid capital of a
quarter-million are reserves of £286,250, and
at September 30 last no less than £293,194 was
in public securities (current market value)
and cash. Besides its capital the co. was
employing £795,815 of debentures. Other
liabilities, including contingency reserves
accumulated in the boom years, and which
may hold some genuine reserves, totted up
£650,839. Of total assets with a book value
slightly more than two millions 74 p.c. was
in pastoral-finance advances; mortgages,
£1,052.315; advances on wool and produce,
£76,322; and current accounts, £352,697.
Besides the investments and cash (£293,194) ;
premises had a book value of £03,338 and
stocks, merchandise, etc., £169,166. All ex-
cept £188,479 of current liabilities were
covered by liquid assets, and as borrowed
capital is securely tied to the business, and
every £1 of liabilities not covered by liquid
assets had the backing of more than 325. of
other assets, the co.’s position was snug.
During the after-war depression the co. was
not pressed by creditors—unlike many other
Maoriland concerns this one did not depend
on depositors for funds —and throughout the
boom period inflated values were heavily dis-
counted. Having £291,631 of reserves to
assist the 125,000 £lO ordinaries paid to £2,
shareholders should be on a good wicket
again now that Maoriland is doing better.

For a number of years this brewery co.’s
accounts had been unsatisfactory. Except-
ing £2OOO added to visible reserves in 1916,
and a round thousand in three other years,
the whole of the profit balances since 1915
have gone into a “rest account,” which was
parcelled up with liabilities and the nature
of which was unknown outside Perkins’s
office. It w r as, therefore, imposs.ble to ascer-
tain the extent of reserves or the size of
liabilities. In fact, for all the outsider could
learn, since the transfer in 1920 there have
been no reserves whatever. During the past
12 months the co. purchased the freehold of
the Empire Hotel, in the Valley, and the
management went outside for practically the
whole of the cash necessary to finance the
deal. Consequently, liabilities expanded
considerably, and the directors have deemed
it advisable to separate reserves and creditor
accounts. It now appears that the total to
the credit of reserves and rest accounts, not
including the latest carry-forward balance,
is £29,289, and that figure has been taken
into the introductory table. That is not
much support for £355,556 of paid capital,
but actual reserves may be larger; the
£80,220 of internal reserves disclosed three
years ago probably did not represent the full
volume of the secret lay-by or the extent to
which assets had appreciated. Even now
the outsider cannot learn much about the
business; but to old hands who didn’t suffer
from the original writing-down the recent
distributions mean a good deal more than
the div. rates indicate. Since 1915 no less
than £222,222 of reserves have been capital-
ised, and the past year’s 6$ p.c. gives a
return of 17£ p.c. on the paid capital prior
to the transfer. Nevertheless, the business
has lost a good deal of the glitter of earlier
years. For eight years to 1912 the co. was
distributing £21,000 p.a. (including div.
tax) ; the div. rate was then high, but capi-
tal account had been heavily carved after
the froth had been blown off the Queensland
boom in the early ’nineties. Ten years ago
£33,333 of new capital was got in, together
with £.11,111 of premiums; but all this
money and reserves since accumulated have
not improved the disclosed profits. The
brewing industry is not nearly the sweet
thing it used to be; Governments have taxed
harder, costs have increased, and threats of
regulation, and even extinction, have been
made. Perkins and Co. does not admit that
it is troubled by the anti-liquor propaganda.
In October another prohibition poll will be
taken, but the directors “feel satisfied the
result will be the same as in 1920—a victory
for continuance.” But it is certain that ail
such victories cost a lot of money to win.
The separation of reserves from liabilities
permits this comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—

The balance-sheet would be more satisfac-
tory if the £134,759 of “trade and other
creditors” was subdivided into fixed and
floating debt. No doubt a considerable por-
tion represents mortgages on properties.
However, the pub-purchases and brewery
extensions have increased the book value
of fixed assets by £106,029 in 10 years.
Meanwhile, the surplus of liquid assets over
liabilities has expanded from £96,481 to
£126,145.

Early in the co.’s latest financial year the
new acid and fertiliser works at Hornby,
near Christchurch, were completed, and com-
menced production. So though trading con-
ditions were not favorable in the first half
of the year, owing to the poor prices ruling
for farmers’ produce, the co. managed to
squeeze 9 p.c. for shareholders. Paid capital
is £400,000 —it has doubled in a dozen years
—and is assisted by £109,000-odd of visible
reserves. The management is in the comfy
position of having to make funds show only
a little more than 7 p.c. in order to give
9 p.c. on capital. The following comparison

that the co. continued to make good profits
while it unloaded the very large stocks on
-hand two years ago. At January ol the
£400,000 of paid capital was represented by
properties, works, etc., with a book value
of £329,380, and a surplus of stocks, book
debts and cash over and above liabilities of
£204,029.
The Deep Levels and Hawkins Hill Cen-
tral cos. having faded out, a proposal is
afoot to give Hill End another go. A. E.
Savage tells the wretched tale, often told
by the “Wild Cat,” of how the revival of a
few years back was restricted to poking
about in old ground, and how the advice of
expert geologists and mining-men who knew
the field was disregarded. Pig-rooting in
shallow ground and periodic city gambles
were the results, and the old field was not
given a chance. Now it is proposed to re-
timber the Patriarch shaft to 410 ft. and run
in north from 370 ft. under Deeps’ workings
and connect with that show’s No. 5 level
with a winze. Another objective is north
in the old Scandinavian’s bottom levels,
while it is also proposed, as a device to
assist funds, to seek the better-grade material
known to exist in the bottom workings of
Deeps and Central.
The float (in which, by the way, the Mar-
shall brethren do not figure) is in a sense
a resuscitation of those two shows. Deeps’
shareholders have first call on scrip, and
then holders in Hawkins Hill at the time of
liquidation. Deep Levels Hill End, N.L., is
to- be in 160,000 half-crown shares, and
95,000 are offered for subscription. The
float is assured, all the contribs. hav-
ing been underwritten. For a start
the purchasers of the Central assets
—a syndicate of old Deeps’ shareholders—
pass over that outfit at cost (£1640) and
undertake to apply for 9600 contribs. Old
Deeps gets £l5OO cash to enable it to meet
its liabilities, and 47,500 fully-paids (one
for two to its shareholders) for its leases and
plant. The prospects of the venture depend
entirely on how the funds are spent, and
those directing the float have had enough
experience of past follies to lead them along
the track of sound development.
The directors of the Crown, formed to
work the recently-discovered gold-reefs at
Mt. Bombandy, liylstone district (N.S.W.),
have decided to pursue a sound development
policy. Ignoring representations made that
on present showing a large battery is justi-
fied, they have arranged to sink three trial
shafts, one at each end and one in the centre
of the formation. These are to go down
50ft., and the lode will then be driven across.
This reversal of a bad old N. S. Wales habit
—erect a battery first and test the mine
afterwards —is satisfactory in a sense; but
the promoters have already put the cart be-
fore the horse in the float. A £lOOO-syndicate
could have done the necessary prospecting,
Bombandy is an attractive surface show, but
there is a diversity of views among mineralo-
gists and geologists as to the gold going
down and as to permanency of lode. The
work now in hand will throw some light
on these points.
* * * *
■•i A Sydney auction-sale advt. recalls the
most sensational and successful “bull” pool
ever operated in N. S. Wales —the Federa-
tion and Mt. Owen. Bears who seemingly
had the advantage of a doubtful mine were
Caught napping very badly, and the bulls
made the pace so hot that the Stock Ex-
change intervened .to protect its members
from the assaults of outsiders by striking
the stock off the list. Three bull operators
are said to have cleaned up nearly £50,000
between them. Little or nothing has since
been done at the alleged mine, and the plant
is to go under the hammer.
Adelaide has taken several options on and
around Jones’s Concessions (W.A.), and
already scrip is being ladled out. It is early
ybt to discuss the merits (if any) of indi-
vidual shows, but several of the floats are
paper-mines. Directors of derelict cos.
\yhose shareholders won’t pay calls have de-
veloped the habit of forming pools to buy-
forfeited shares, take options over “some find
of importance,” and talk of a coming boom.
Later the public is given exaggerated reports
of values, there is a flutter, and the forfeited
shares, which were bought for a song, are
unloaded. This pirating was rampant at
Hampton Plains and at Mt. Juglah, and the
same methods threaten to soon bring Jones’s
Concessions into disrepute.^
Westralia Mt. Morgans (W.A.) has got
another lease of life. Last year about 5v)00
tons obtained from the old shallow work-
ings were treated for about £lO,OOO worth of
gold, and enough stuff is said to be in sight
to keep the mill running a long time. This
mine was found in 1896, and was floated
in London by A. E. Morgans. Over a million
pounds’ worth of gold was produced, and
about a fourth of that sum was paid in divs.
Then profits ceased, and the co. ultimately
buried itself in debt.
# * * *
Coolgardie Redemption (W.A.) has risen
from the dead. For years it was at rest,
because the Government, having loaned a
former owner £lOOO, insisted that anyone
taking up the show should adopt the lia-
bility. In 1921, however, this claim was
waived, and the original pi'ospectors took
possession. Recently they sold out to a Mel-
bourne crowd. The mine produced a few
thousand ounces in the early days, but, like
a lot of other Coolgardie ventures, it proved
a failure in the hands of a co.
Devon (W.A.) generally broadcasts some-
thing cheerful on the eve of a call. The
latest was the announcement by the Board
that the new manager had found payable ore
where the late manager dolefully reported
there was none. Devon has had many man-
agers in its time; and the most capable who
tackled the show decided that it could never
be made to pay. There certainly is gold in
the property, but the formation is not of
the type which will give profits. Devon is
like many another small mine in the West:
its working has benefited the State, but not
shareholders.
* * * *
Gnow’s Nest (W.A.) has just had a turn-
up at 2Soft. The reef there was not ex-
pected to go down ; but it has, and, though
narrow, is showing values of from £5 to
£lO per ton. The co. has done well so tar,
and may pay divs. soon. Most of the shares
are held by a capable mining crowd, includ-
ing two or three Kalgoorlie mine-managers
and a few well-known Perth speculators.
The public has so far not been allowed in
to any extent. it
Again Earle Huntley allots New Guinea
Copper ( alias Laloki) 285,000 tons contain-
ing 13,000 tons copper and 35,0000 z. gold.
Reserves are as follows: —
( Average •,
Tons. Copper. Gold.
Laloki .. .. 240,000 44 p.c. 2idwt.
Dubuna .. • • 45,000 5 p.c. 2ldwt.
285,000
Huntley’s sampling is practically the same
as G. Klug’s, when the latter went pioneer-
ing to Laloki for the Great Fitzroy. Hogan
Taylor in 1921 put the cost of producing
blister copper f.o.b. at port at £42 to £4B
a ton, and estimated ore reserves at over
200,000 tons. Taking costs at £45 a ton
and refining and realisation at another £l9,
probable profits with copper at £7O a ton
don’t put the cash already paid up much
into the shade. In 1920 the co. showed that
£76,823 had been paid in cash and £lOO,OOO
of paper had gone to the old Laloki for its
property. A year later cash paid was
£143,065, and in 1922 £258,574; and accord-
ing to Hogan Taylor a lot more than was
originally estimated was necessary to get
things into shape. In June, 1922, capital
was raised to £500,000 by the creation of
150,000 new £1 shares on top of the old
350,000 £1 shares and by re-casting the
whole 500,000 shares into £250,000 of ordi-
nary capital and £250,000 10 p.c. cum. prefs.,
of which 125,000 have been issued since June
at par. If the show is to “go big” it wants
a lot more ore developed. The following-
down of 7 to 8 p.c. ore in the Dubuna bottom-
tunnel winzes is therefore of “special inter-
est.” Finance will be helped by the Com-
monwealth agreeing to buy the co.’s railway,
jetty and rolling stock for £45,000, though
it cost the co. £15,101 more. Current liabili-
ties amount to £16,727, and there is £39,600
of non-interest bearing bonds on the books.
That debt is a relic of the Great Fitzroy
days, and will have to be redeemed out of
profits whenever they come along. Huntley
is to get his smelter at work in August.

Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), has just declared
its 100th div., making 995. per share—
£l4l,2Bs in all. Productive work is con-
fined to levels from 600 ft. upwards. The
shaft is much deeper, but the failure to do
further prospecting work below 600 ft. looks
ominous. Surely it would be wise to apply
a fair proportion of present profits to deeper
exploration! Or are the principals obsessed
with the idea, once promulgated by the emi-
nent geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, that
gold cannot live in quartz reefs below
600 ft.? That opinion was expressed particu-
larly in relation to Bendigo reefs, and it was
true enough that on several lines of reef
barren zones were encountered at about that
depth.
* * * *
Unwatering of Bird’s Reef, Bendigo, has
drawn out to months instead of the expected
weeks. Baling tanks have hauled 400,000
gallons per day, and old workings for more
than half-a-mile have been well drained. A
10-in. Cornish lift is now in action, and it
is probable that bv the end of this week the
400 ft. level will be open for inspection, and
that bottom (500 ft.) will be reached a few
days later. Former managers declare that
the 400 ft. level will show satisfactory condi-
tions, but the key to the situation is in the
result of the geological changes at 500 ft.
* * * *
From Bendigo: If averages be worked out
it will be found that New Blue has run
the usual course of claims on the line. Some
of the stopes south have cut out their spurs,
and overhead the rich quartz has gone. So
stone in the western slates will now have to
be worked on a bigger scale, with a corres-
ponding decline, in yields. The next step
will be to see how the shoots live underfoot
at 1700 ft., and that can be ascertained only
by getting the south shaft down another lift
and opening out, which means time and
money. Of course Bendigo, which knows
when to take a tip—anyhow, it never
gets married to a stock —has been floating
out of the show, and it probably won’t come
back again for some time.
* * * *
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), is again
at the 10s. mark. Driving under the lead, rising
into the wash, and crosscutting to the west
have brought to light a length of about
4Joi't. of lead. It has not been cut up, but
because some truck-load samples from drives
give 3oz and 4oz. averages the market has
had this jump.

the Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), will take a lot
of beating. For over 20 years it has continuously
battled against adverse conditions. At odd times
hope has led to the flattering belief that difficulties
had been so far removed that profitable work would
soon be in full swing. In 1914 it was officially
reported that “wash extraction would probably com-
mence early next year.” The result of these unreal-
ised anticipations has been that the stock has had a
rocket-and-stick experience in the share market—-at
times quoted in pounds and at others in pence. The
two original shafts were lost through excessive drift
pressure consequent on their being sunk in the centre
of the gutter, and this meant a direct loss of
£25,000. From the present shafts steady pumping
of up to 3,000,000ga1. of water per day has been
proceeding.
The management now seems to be satisfied that
conditions are favorable for the systematic extrac-
tion of wash. A labyrinth of drives and bores has
proved the existence of extensive bodies of wash. A
drive across the bottom of the gutter at the south
end of the mine has gone 300 ft. with wash still in
the face, and several trial puddlings from this point
have returned from 4oz. to 7oz. gold per fathom. Gen-
eral panelling operations are expected to start in a
few weeks at the south end, where, at the outset, five
or six parties of miners should be employed. Simi-
lar work will soon be undertaken at the north end.
It is estimated that each party should extract about
65 fathoms a fortnight, and that about an ounce to
the fathom should cover mine expenses. But an ounce
is likely to prove far too little.
That, on disclosed prospects, Langi Logan wash
will give a fair margin over and above working
costs appears a certainty. If all goes well good divi-
dends should be forthcoming; but before the mine
can be said to be earning profits some evidence is
necessary to show how prospects stand in relation to
the £lOO,OOO of capital spent on the property.

Alex. Gordon’s South Aus. Oilwells, hav-
ing “received” a sample from a “seepage on
the very large area the co. has secured the
rights to bore over on the south-east coast
of S. Aus.,” called in the assistance of the
Vic. Mines Department. The laboratory did
not have enough for exhaustive tests, but
results “confirm the opinion that the oily
portion is a mineral oil with a high boiling
point, the volatile light fractions having
been lost either by natural or artificial dis-
tillation.” The sample is classed as “a low-
grade lubricating oil, or a fuel-oil which is
the residual remaining after the lighter oils
have been removed.”

Queensland gold yield for April was
74490 z. (fine) worth £31,641, compared with
62190 z. and £26,416 for April, 1922. The
increase of 12300 z. came mostly from fields
other than Mt. Morgan, chiefly Gympie, Mt.
Coolon and the Oaks. The Charters Towers
return was nil, as against 4550 z. The yield
for the first four months this year was
25,6160 z. (fine) compared with 89360 z. for
the same neriod of 1922. Indications are
fairlv healthy for a continued increase dur-
ing the present year, although Normanby has
disappointed, and the Towers will possibly
prove a dud over the last lap.

There does not seem much chance of Mt.
Chalmers copper, Rockhampton (Q.), get-
ting a move on. An application for six
months’ exemption has been lodged and re-
commended. The co. hopes to make a start
in four to five months, and is arranging for
shipping facilities at Broadmount. Every-
thing depends on the copper market, which
has slipped back about £3 since the reopening
was first mooted a few weeks back.

The Billy Hughes co.. Normanby (N.Q.),
is still working the Frederick, but the grade
is low: a crushing of 18 tons averaged 14dwt.
Small lots of picked ore from the Perse-
verance and Glengarry crushed for to
2oz. per ton. Percy Meredith got assays of
30dwt. from two samples taken from an old-
worked reef near the battery, and he seems
anxious to try another reef and let the Fred-
erick slide The co. has 50 tons in hand
from the Billy Hughes, which are expected
to run 2oz. » * *
The last three crnshings of the Tyrconnell,
Kingsborough (N.Q.), have given 4360 z.
from 480 tons. The co. is maintaining its
monthly output at around 160 tons; for the
four weeks ended May 9 165 tons gave 1430 z.
Values continue steady, too, but the
stuff fed to the battery towards the close of
last year has faded to an average of under
18dwt.

The Queensland Government is starting to
open up the Garrick seam, on the Bowen
coalfield, although what it wants extra coal
for is not quite clear, as the Bowen runs
about lift. The Garrick is a half-mile ahead
of the other in position, and a tunnel is
already down well into the seam. The sec-
tion of coal is six or seven feet thick, and
analyses show it to be slightly better in
quality than the Bowen seam; but it is
friable and won’t stand the same handling.

Arthur King is back in Sydney telling
Nawng Pet shareholders details of the
narrow escape their co. had in the. dark
weeks of last year. After manager Milligan
had failed to produce results, a report got
abroad that the property was valueless and
the plant inefficient, and creditors rushed to
court for a winding-up order. This was
averted by King undertaking to pay off the
£14,000 indebtedness at the rate of £1250
per month. Then, with Dubois, he hastened
to the mine, and tin-winning was begun in
earnest with two lifts and an improvised
elevator. During the 10 months to April,
278,000 yd. were treated for 256 tons oxide,
which, in an improving market, realised
£26,000. Costs were kept down to £645 per
month during the first half of the period, but
very necessary spares and development work
increased the average to £823 for the latter
half. But there was a good margin over
and above the average cost of £777, and the
co. was swept clear of all debt. Now that
the second dam is completed and another
plant is in course of erection, King talks
cheerfully of prospects. He expects an aver-
age of 24 tons for the next few months,
and hopes to increase to between 30 and 40
tons when the property is completely opened
up. He also forecasts that costs should run
into only about £6OO per month, equal to
approximately 6 tons oxide. As the average
dredge has to win 18 tons before it shows
a profit, the performances of Powell’s pneu-
matic tail-race, with which the property is
equipped, will be watched with considerable
interest by tin-men during the next few
months.

Bux, of the Bndak boom, awaits word
from 11. S. Lyne, “a gentleman who has had
wide experience on the oil-fields of America,”
and its own R. M. Boyd, as to how the
Borneo oil concession goes. “Documents”
have reached Melbourne from the Dutch
East Indies Government, and they satisfy
the Board. So Boyd is now conducting Lyne
to the wilds to find the seepage. To get the
party undei* way has mopped up all the cash
in the till (£1158), so 20s. calls loom ahead.
Bux still has £17,000 uncalled, and the faith-
ful are in to the death in the oil venture.

_ “Sir Spen”: The divine quality of for-
giveness crops up in unexpected places. At
Coonamble (N.S.W.) Quarter Sessions a
woman who had been engaged as cook by a
station-owner was charged with having
levanted with the household treasure-chest
containing £72 17s. lOd. The case terminated

“Exul” on broken necks (B. 12/4/’23) :
The mere fracture of a cervical vertebra is not
necessarily a dangerous injury unless it is accom-
panied by severe concussion of or haemorrhage into
the spinal cord. The fatal fracture is generally one
in which the bone, as well as being broken, is also
dislocated, thus compressing and often severing the
cord. Death from judicial hanging is due to local
destruction of the cord following on a dislocation
of the second cervical vertebra, the odontoid pro-
cess of which tilts inwards and crushes the cord.
When I was casualty surgeon at the Sydney Hospi-
tal a man walked in saying he had had a fall and
had hurt his neck. 1 had him X-rayed, and we
found a fracture of one of his cervical vertebne.
While he was sitting on a chair there during the
preparation of his bed a surgeon of considerable
experience entered the ward. On my explaining
the case he instantly seized the patient’s head in a
firm grip and ordered him not to make the slightest
movement. After we had mechanically fixed the
broken neck the honorary pointed out to me that
an injudicious movement of the head might have
converted the simple fracture into a fracture-dislo-
cation accompanied by sudden death. Some years
later a private patient of mine partially dislocated
his neck by suddenly twisting his head too far.
Under chloroform I put It straight again with a
click. The accident did not seem to affect him
much; anyhow, he split my lip very effectively when
I was called in a week later to help him rout the
whisky-colored snakes which he alleged were advanc-
ing upon him in massed battalions.
“Hokytiky”: Although the West Coast of
Maoriland’s South Island is a sanctuary for
Hibernians, the carefree atmosphere has not
impaired the cautiousness inherent in the
Scotchbyterian divine of a local village. The
other day his order to the butcher included
‘‘Scraps for the cat, up to threepence.” The
butcher had already deciphered the manu-
script and packed the dainty morsels when
his ’phone tingled. “Would you minj can-
celling the last item on ma order?” piped
the Scot. “I see the cat has just caught a
sparrow.”
“R.R.”: It doesn’t always take a faith-
healer to give a cripple the use of his limbs
again. There is a citizen of Woollahra
(N.S.W.) who was completely disabled by
an accident six years ago and left (appa-
rently) a hopeless paralytic. He divided his
time between bed and an invalid chair; and
he had to be dressed by his wife before lie
could get into the chair. The other day the
wife, while carrying a lighted lamp, fainted
and fell, and the flame set fire to some
hangings. The invalid leaped from his chair,
extinguished the blaze, and then rushed off
for a doctor. He has been a normal man
ever since. The explanation is that his in-
capacity, genuine enough at first, had been
continued by mental processes ; and it needed
a shock like this to cure him. Hickson might
have done the trick just as well, but an un-
kind Fate cheated the healer of what could
have been starred as a wonderful cure.
“Clifford Snook” : Victorian law has curi-
ous ideas on house-breaking and other break-
ages. The other day it gave its pet burglar-
girl, aged 25, three years certain, with an
indefinite number of years to follow, as a
habitual criminal; also it ordered her to come
up for eight more sentences when called on.
She certainly had been an astonishing bur-
glar, but the things a girl can carry away
aren’t very large. Not long before a very
habitual breaker was also before the Law. In
the course of years he had broken his wife in
so many places that the poor scarred wreck
had lost count. Finally he broke into a
house, not for clean, polite burglary, but to
get at his wife, who had left him, and to kick
her face with his working boots, and batter
the relative who sheltered her. Some J’s.P.
fined this breaker certain quids, the typical
J.P. being a stodgy reptile-of-scorn who is kept
for such purposes. The Melbourne wife-
flogger is almost always fined a modest
amount. Then he generally takes his wife
home, and makes her work like the devil to
earn the fine, and biffs her some more to keep
her up to the mark. Victoria would be
almost a model State if its .T’s.P. were dead.

“Otus” (M.L.) : Mark Briggs, Maoriland’s
most persistent conscientious objector, was
forcibly taken to Europe during the World
War, and was away 18 months in all, during
which time he refused military pay as well
as military service. On his return to Wel-
lington he also refused to accept his dis-
charge, protesting that he had never been a
soldier. Whereupon a perplexed brigadier-
general placed him under arrest —for re-
fusing pay which he said he had not earned
and for not taking a discharge from an
army in whose ranks he had never fought.
When it began to look as if Briggs at home
might prove even a more complicated pro-
blem than Briggs abroad, commonsense came
on the scene in the form of a major-general,
who told the stickler for principle to light
out for home. Which he did. He is pro-
bably the only man compulsorily listed as a
member of the Expeditionary Force who
obstinately refuses to be discharged.

“Centurion” resurrects some old troubles:
Robert Brothers indicates (B. 3/5/’23) that the
anti-Australian feeling still prevails in S. Africa.
There was a good deal more behind it 20 years ago
than the smashing of the Standard bar in Capetown.
Before the war Australians had achieved unpopular-
ity in Jo’berg by their Labor sympathies: to the Jew
money-spinners the very name of a union was ana-
thema. Then the undeniable superiority of the Aus-
tralian regiments over the nondescript S’African
levies, barring the early regiments of the Imperial
Light Horse, was an offence, especially as the Aus-
tralian made no secret of his contempt. Rarely,
however, were there many genuine Afrikanders in
these forces. The too-casual Australian showed
his opinion of them by commonly referring
to lice as “Roberts’s Horse,” and the gibe rankled.
As for the Standard bar affair, the row was pro-
voked by the deliberate insolence of the Capetown
Jews who ran the bar, and no one was sorry for
them. But the Canadians really had more to do
with it than the Australians. Another little affair

that did them no good was the smashing up of the
offices and printing works of Ons Land, a Dutch
journal which specialised in the blackguarding - of
Australians. That little enterprise, by the way, was,
organised and led by a man who earned great fame
as a Brigadier of Light Horse in Palestine.

cently explained his irregularity in attend-
ance at Sunday-school by telling teacher that
he was obliged to work. “I hope you don’t

I don’t do nothing like that,” came the re-
assuring reply; “I only climbs a tree and

Park.”

“Flicker”: Our office charlady was holding
forth on the difficulty of securing peaceable
and respectable lodgers, in proof whereof
she related how her latest incubus had come
home “tanked,” and had done his best to give
a life-like reproduction of a Marne village
after an intensive bombardment. “And did
you get rid of him, Mrs. Moppit?” inquired
one of the sympathetic staff. “No, Mr.
Briggs, I overlooked it,” she said. “’E come
down nex’ day, Sundee it was, lookin’ very
crook. ‘Mrs. Moppit,’ ’e says, ‘I was boozed
lars night; I’m sorry.’ But I took ’im up
short. ‘Bein’ sorry don’t count,’ sez I. ‘The
question is didja or didja not come in and
smash a pitcher in the ’all, throw a crayfish
at mother, and drink all the beer wot I ’ad
saved up for ter-day? Didja or didja not
chuck all yer washin’-stand china out into
the street, an’ want to fight th’ John when

’Arris,’ I sez, ‘that yer a lodger ’ere, not one
of the family.’ ”
“Footslogger”: However ihuch, or little,
the Yank may have helped to win the war, he
certainly did something to brighten its clos-
ing stages. Up at Villers-Bret., just before
the big stunt in August, 1918, a detachment
of gum-chewers arrived one day to join some
Diggers who were bivouacked along a ridge
near the Aubismy trenches. Possies were
about as plentiful as hymn-books in a two-
up school, and a number of the guys got
left in the scramble for accommodation. One
temporarily homeless citizen from the Land
of Dahllars, after looking about hopelessly,
called out, “Say, who’s the janitor around
here?” The roar of laughter that ran along
the ridge was nearly as heartening as an
issue of rum.
“Girofla”: “Tauwarra” (B. 26/4/’23)
doubts whether the isolation of a white leper
has more to justify it than the old Biblical
traditions of “uncleanness.” This was a
common medical view half-a-century ago,
when hereditary influences were thought to
be the main cause of the disease, but the
discovery of the specific leprosy bacillus in
1871 changed all that. Infection is nowa-
days held the prime factor. Sir L. Rogers,
in India, showed in a large series of leper
cases that 58 per cent, had been living at
some period in the same houses as lepers.
In the Pacific Islands the disease is still

notoriously frequent simply because there
is no stringent isolation of cases. On the
other hand, in northern European countries
where isolation is rigidly enforced leprosy
is dying out. The fact that only 500 case's
have been recorded in Australia is no reason
for relaxing the vigilance that modern medi-
cal science regards as indispensable.

“Sixenate”: Justice Owen has qpset the
idea, if it existed, that the petitioner in a
case for restitution of conjugal rights must
represent himself as consumed by a yearning
for the return of the undutiful spouse. A
woman petitioner frankly declared that there
was nothing she desired less than that the
husband who had thumped and starved her
should obey the order of Court for which
she had applied. On this ’Sonor remarked
that, provided there was nothing in the con-
duct of the petitioner to which the Court
could object, she Was none the less entitled
to the order. So the old legal fiction that
the seeker for divorce along this well-used
track must be a sort of confidence person
who pulls the Law's leg with a tale that she
wants something or somebody really “re-
stored” may be considered exploded.

“0.K.”: A quaint study in German men-
tality was lately provided at Melbourne
Criminal Court. Louisa Muller, pork butcher,
was convicted on her own confession of hav-
ing systematically burgled the ironmongery
shop next door, the burgling being usually
achieved on Sunday afternoon by way of the
roof-tops and a fanlight. Her original story
to the Bench was as follows:
Her father was one of the German citizens who had
been interned (for 2f years) during the war, and
since his release the ironmonger next door had made
the district too hot to hold him. She carried on
the business with her brother and sister. She bad
deeply felt the internment of her father, and she
blamed the ironmongery establishment for it. For
quite a lorig time the internment grievance preyed
on her mind, and “whenever she lay down it came
to her that she had to go next door and take things.”
Finally, with a decisive snap of her jaw and
toss of her head, Louisa said “That is the
FORESTALLED.
“ I’m tellin ’ yer—ye can’t come into this
house.”
“But, constable, I’m a pressman sent here
to do the murder.”
“ Ye’re too late. The murder’s been done.”
revenge I had for my father’s internment.”
She was “getting even with” the ironmonger,
whom she stupidly debited with all the re-
sponsibility for her offensive parent’s intern-
ment —indulging the true Teutonic crav-
ing for making the enemy or the supposed
enemy pay. And after she was taken pri-
soner* Louisa developed a capacity for faint-
ing. Previously she could climb housetops
and mutilate slate roofs. But when she fell
into the hands of the enemy she started to
faint and shed tears profusely. How true
to type these Teutons run!
TRUE POLITENESS.
“Dear, you’re spilling all your peas. Watch the way uncle eats Ms.”
“Laurie”: Apropos the intelligence .of
juries. I saw one in a civil court being
sworn in the other day. The tipstaff handed
a worn Bible to the first man, and in a
mechanical voice repeated the customary
oath, adding at the end, “Say ‘I swear,’ and
take your seat.” “I sw ear and take my seat,”
repeated the tutored citizen dutifully.

“S.M.” : A glamor attaches to that cabled
description of the great review at Moscow,
where the soldiers marched past by thousands,
splendidly equipped (so the story goes), and
decked in bright new uniforms. For two
hours Trotsky, son of a Jew chemist, stood
returning the salute just like a Czar of the
olden time. ■ That sort of spectacle gives
the ambitious amateur Bolshevik new heart.
The smallest Garden or Walsh is liable to
picture himself as the future Lenm or
Trotsky of his own country, with power of
life and death, the run of the Treasury, the
grovel of the army, the right to compose his
own uniform, and a life job. But, the world
is nearly all disappointments. If the Aus-
tralian Soviet revolution came in sight to-
morrow the chances are that the noisy and
bustling leaders would be brushed aside by
the Theodore type of man—vigorous, experi-
enced, with a personal following, an inscrut-
able poker-player’s countenance, a voice like
a great amen, and a fixed conviction that his
place is among the good things of life. Then
Mr. Garden, who, after all, doesn’t seem to
have enough personal following to carry him
into the State Legislature, might be offered a
doorkeeper’s place in the new “republic,” and
labelled “disaffected” if he didn’t jump at it.
When there is room for only one Trotsky it
is a big gamble to wreck society on the chance
of being the # #
“G. Moses”: Melbourne’s pretty 25-year-
old burglaress strikes me as an arithmetical
problem. She was in the past convicted
eight times, but five times she served no sen-
tence. So I suppose she was five first
offenders. Then, the other day, she was
convicted, I think, 10 times right off. Any-
how, she got seven sentences, but three
being concurrent they only amount to three
years certain, and a possible term of her
natural life afterwards. That is to say, she
is to be detained as a “habitual,” which is
quite indefinite. The three years and the
natural life are also concurrent, I suppose.
A day or two later she was convicted eight
times more, and ordered to come’ up for sen-
tence when called on. This, it was explained
to her, meant that, if she got over the three
years and the indefinite term for being
“habitual,” and then robbed again, she would
be hauled up again, get eight more sentences
without ceremony, and would be also given
one or more indefinite terms for being more
“habitual” than ever. After that the Law
would proceed to try her on the new charge,
or ei"M new charges. I have tr’ed to add
the lady up. but have got no further than
deciding that she is numerous.

“0.K.”: How much of the demoralisation
in political life is due to the camera, so
freely used in journalism? Before the days
of photographic reproductions there was. to
be sure, much illustrated newspaper, and of
the now obsolete woodcuts a notorious
Yankee boodler said: “It was the picters that
killed me.” He didn’t mind what was writ-
ten by way of exposing his politico-finan-
cial villainies, but the crude comic cartoons
which hit general public ignorance and stu-
pidity in the eye had brought his reign
to an end. If “picters” can kill a public
man with their steady drip of ridicule, they
also can glorify and magnify his name by
professing to take vain pretences as serious
achievements. To the game of guff, bluff
and nonsense up-to-date journalism gives
its earnest patronage. Cheap politicians are
for ever being posed as valuable servants of
the country, and uninspiring Cabinet-workers
go the whole hog in masquerading before the
camera fiend. These remarks are prelimi-
nary to a contemptuous mention of a recent
photograph in Melbourne Herald, headed
“Better Than Cabling.” Underneath the pic-
ture was the explanation: “Mr. Lawson
(right) having a heart-to-heart talk on
immigration matters with Mr. J. McWhae,
Victorian Agent-General, at Victoria House,
London.” A fat, baldheaded gentleman, very
bald indeed, holds a document, whereat he
gazes beamingly while a less genial-looking
citizen regards it frowningly. His knitted
brows are intended to gull everybody save
the photographer, who stage-managed the
photograph. The preposterous bit of bunkum
professes to fully account for Lawson’s tem-
porary absence from the duty of directing
Victoria’s welfare in Melbourne. He is
working for its salvation in London. He
is enjoying the—well, to tell the truth, the
oid soldier is just seeking the bubble repu-
tation in the camera’s mouth.
“Bill o’ Costs” on the ways of his tribe: —
Inconsistent (or “alternative”) pleading generally
mystifies the honest layman. When, for instance,
he reads pleas denying that the defendant made the
contract and, in the alternative, that he satisfied
it by performance, he, the layman, wants to know
why litigants cannot be restricted to one straight-
forward ground of claim or defence. The answ'er is
that the all-in system saves time and expense. When
a claim or defence is limited to a single issue it
looks simple, but as the evidence comes out another
and better basis of action or answer is frequently
shown, and then, to prevent injustice, amendments
have to be allowed. Arguments over these and
wrangles about adjournments are a chronic nuisance,
wherefore the rules of practice encourage the man
behind the litigious gun to take every ground that
reasonably suggests itself, and to be prepared with
amendments as well, to meet any unexpected turn
of the case.
Amateurs can do well enough at times. My client,
a medico, weighed in with this list of alternative
pleas in answer to a demand for the annual tax
on his motor-car: (c) That He was not the owner;
(2) that the contraption was not a car but only so
designated by courtesy; (3) that it was dismantled
and only so much mechanical junk; (4) that he
used it on Government business, and, therefore, it
was exempt; (5) that it would not go, anyway;
(6) that it was. a source of public danger, and to
license it was contrary to public policy; (7) that
he formally tendered the car, or component parts
thereof, to the Registrar in satisfaction of the impost.
In the words of the morning papers “a strong bar
has been retained.”

“Beamish”: The amount of advertisement
plastered on “Sauizzy” Taylor (B. 26/4/’23)
is nothing to the I’melight poured on the
bloodhounds in nursuit of “Squizz.v” and
his kind. Nowadays a detective can’t rout
out a man who has faded to pay his dog-
license without a battalion of cameras fol-
lowing h’m ud and recording his expression
of superhuman intelligence. Whenever there
is a sensational case on, about half the force
is pictured in groups inspecting Exhibit Q,
while the leading investigators, are shown
like movie queens in five or six different posi-
tions. This boosting of a service that claims
to be silent and secret cannot be altogether
unsolicited, because the ’tecs are almost in-
variably taken smoking cigars. Well aware
that their tastes in most cases run to the
humble fag or pipe, I can only assume that
the array of Flores Publ'iciosos is specially
put on for advertising purposes.

“Kip”: The nastiest jolt ever 1 received
to my regimental pride came from the
lips of a harmless-looking and obviously
well-meaning Frenchman. My battalion
had just disembarked at Marseilles, and'
the sight of that alluring city proved
too much for us Diggers. On the quay
itself, as we marched along in fours
carrying our kit-bags, we looked presentable
enough ; but as soon as we entered a shop-
lined street, the cafes claimed considerably
more than their fair share of rank-breakers.
Later, brewery d rays and similar convey-
ances enabled most of them to rejoin the
depleted column. I was one of a small party
not so fortunate. In the maze of quayside
streets we lost our way, and eventually en-
countered an English-speaking Frenchman,
whose courtesy evoked our admiration. See-
ing that we were strangers, he became more
profuse in his directions, winding up with
the innocent query: “But, pardon roe, I ’af
already seen some of your camarades —you
are refugees from Serbia, are you not, mes-
sieurs?”

“V.C.”: Helping to collect the Chinks after
the stampede mentioned by “Nemo” (B.
3/5/’23) was one of the queerest jobs in a
queer war. Scattered in blind panic from
Fritz’s bombs over a radius of 10 miles, they
had to be forcibly dragged out of ditches, cul-
verts and haystacks. Several were found
dead, for no apparent reason but sheer fright,
in hiding-places many miles from the com-
pound ; some, as far as we could judge, with
our limited knowledge of their language, were
insane. On that occasion the Oriental for-
got to be “inscrutable,” but I remember
another time when he was true to label at
the expense of an. Engineer officer in charge.
In course of constructing a new road a
large boulder weighing several tons was found
to be in the way. Seeing no other means of
removing it the engineer went off to H.Q. for
some explosive. Returning later he dis-
covered that the rock had vanished. The
relics of an older civilisation had dug a hole
under it and incorporated it with the road.
HEADS AND TALES.
“Yes, I know I’m a trifle bald. Beginning
to look like an old head on young shoul-
ders, eh!”
“Humph! That’s not what’s worrying me.
It was what I hear about a young
bobbed head on your shoulder at the
dance that YOU'VE got to explain.”
“The Rumpus”: Re mumbled anu jumbled
prayers of infants, quoted by “Wealsman”
(B. 19/4/’23). Quite clear and distinct were
the words of a five-year-old youngster, repeat-
ing what he thought his mother had said:
“And lead us not into potatoes, but deliver
us from all weevils.” The same lad was
much interested in a saddle his uncle brought
home, and that night his mind kept straying
to it. When it came to the “God bless” part
of his prayers, he made the following amaz-
ing plea: “Please, God, bless daddy, and
please, God, put the saddle on mummy!”
“SPENDING SILVER.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cashed note passes quickly,
The spending silver goes,
Where wine is passing thickly
And life in revels flows.
But hearts are full of thrillings, .
The world is fair and round:
There’s twenty silver shillings
In every crinkling pound.
Oh, some may fortune cherish,
And hoard each note they get,
But wealth with him will perish
Whose end by Death is set;
For He, in all His killings,
Sends man’s schemes to the ground..,.
Still, twenty shining shillings
Are in each crinkling pound.
Her eyes with love are glowing,
Her ri(h lips redly shine;
Oh, bright is life, full-flowing,
When there is love and wine!
While music soft is trilling
Let money still be found,
And speed each silver shilling
In ev’ry crinkling pound.
There’s monuments around him
men of high degree;
Old mother-earth has bound him.
And they are dead as he.
His spending silver spilling,
He went his merry round,
And sped each shining shilling
In ev’ry crinkling pound.

The Bruce-Pages can hardly be accused of
placating anybody (unless it be the Mel-
bourne Club) by appointing Donald Mackiu-
non, ex-Vic. Attorney-General, as Commis-
sioner in U.S.A. Since Parker, the Laborite,
beat him for Prahran two and a half years
ago, Mackinnon has ceased to be a political
entity, and was settling down to such jobs
as president of the Cricket Assoc, and mem-
ber of the Charities Board when he got
the eg 11 from Bruce. Thobgh he has kept
Tory company, and was considered true-blue
enough to be president of Melbourne Club,
the democratic spell which Iliginbotham cast
on him 34 years ago when he was helping
the great man to consolidate the Vic. statutes
has remained. He spurned any title as a
reward for his honorary work as Director-
General of Recruiting, and let smaller men
have the baubles.
A. G. ALANSON , newly-elected president of
the N.S.W. Public Schools Teachers'
Federation.
Edward S. Wyndham on early surveys:—
Apropos the reference (B. 3/5/’23) to Mt. Wilson,
in the Blue Mountains, I made the first survey
there in the winter of 1868, and have no doubt
that I was the first white man to set foot on it.
Until the road now in use was located and marked
out by me it was entirely unknown. The eastern
end of the ridge, now known as Mt. Irvine, was
discovered in 1867 by Mr. Bowen, of Mt. Tomah,
but he knew no way of getting there except by
climbing down into the precipitous gorge that
rurs between it at d Mt. Tomah. The zigzag road
that ascends the side of Mt. Wilson was cut under
my supervision in 1868. Mr. Brownrigg, to whom
reference was made in “T.0.1.’5” par., joined me
as assistant soon after I finished at Mt. Wilson,
and helped in making a traverse of the Cox R.ivr,
from Hartley to Burragorang—up to that time it
(the river) was only indicated on the maps by a
dotted line. At that time Brownrigg had not yet
got his license as a surveyor; any surveying he
did at Mt. Wilson or elsewhere must have been at
a later date. The name Mt. Wilson was given
by P. F. Adams, then Deputy Surveyor-General,
when he visited my camp there, and was given in
honor of J. Bowie Wilson, the Minister for Lands.
My license as a surveyor is dated 1867, and signed
by W. R. Davidson, then Surveyor-General. I
doubt if there are many living who hold licenses
of an earlier date.
Buried at Ivillara station, on the Darling,
Captain Tom Johnstone, who commanded
the Jolly Miller in the palmy days of the
big western gutter. Probably the best-
remembered of all the old-time river
skippers, he stood well over 6ft. in his socks,
was of prodigious strength, and so religious
that the only expletive he was ever known
to use in a swearful emergency was “Rub-
bish !”
Passed out in Launceston in his 79th year
F. VV. Grubb, who took h’s dead father’s
seat in the Tas. Lpper House in 1879. He
once spoke all night against a Payment of
Members’ Bill to enable two absent members
to reach the House and vote with him. But
they lost on the
division. Grubb
was an original
director of the
Tasmania gold-
mine, at Beacons-
field, also of the
once rich Western
silver-mine at Zee-
han, and was the
founder of the well-
known Bengeo
sheep stud. His
first and second
wives were cousins,
and, like him,
sprang from rural
stock, dating well
back in the Speck's
history.
W. H. FOOTE.
conductor of the
S.A. State Orches-
tra and on the staff
of Adelaide Con-
servaterium.
Old-contributor “Platman’s” testimonial:
I heard Theodore in Townsville 10 years ago, on
the tramway strike, arid I heard him as Premier in
the Toowoomba Town Hall the other day. A decade
back he was below the average of Labor speakers,
as to both matter and manner; now as a platform
speaker he stands head and shoulders above most of
his colleagues and everything the Opposition can
produce. His sentences are crisp and clear-cut, his
style lucid, and the voice-production, in which he
has evidently had training, is excellent. Frankly
I went prejudiced and came away admiring a man
who has so plainly taken advantage of the oppor-
tunity to improve himself. One may disagree with
his policy, but no one can deny his strength.
A. J. Brierley, the Sydney accountant, who
died on the Kensington golf links on Satur-
day, was a partner in Kent, Brierley and
Sully, which looks after the affairs of the
Dixson Trust. It was he who some years
ago went to Russia to acquire those large
timber areak in Siberia which were to make
many fortunes; but things went wrong, and
a few hundred thousands were lost instead.
He had much better luck with McKenzie’s,
another timber enterprise, and nursed it into
a big and profitable concern. He was 65 at
the very sudden end, and didn’t look it.
Two brothers well up in the R.C. church
in the Speck, Monsignor and Archdeacon
Beechinor, of Launceston and Devonport
respectively, will shortly celebrate their dia-
mond jubilee as priests. The Monsignor was
ordained on May 27, 1863, in the Pope’s
Cathedral at Rome by tile Pope’s Vicar-
General (Cardinal Patrizi), and the Arch-
deacon got his ticket the following month.
Not so long ago Archpriest Hennebry, also
of Tas., celebrated his diamond jubilee.
Charles Worsley, R.8.A., who died at
Brescia, in Lombardy, last month, was per-
haps the best known of M.L. artists. A tire-
less toiler, he combined rare business acumen
with the foibles of temperament. Up to the
last his working hours were from 6 a.m.
to 10 p.m.; and hundreds of his pictures
must have been painted by artificial light.
In Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington
he installed agents to boost his works. His
income for some years is said to have been
over £4OOO. In M.L. he foupd a readymarket
for his Continental scenes, many a weaftny
Canterbury sheepfarmer exulting in the pos-
session of a “100-guinea Worsley.” His
earliest M.L. landscape paintings were his
best; later he mostly turned out mere best
sellers. A charming and cultured gentleman,
he would have regarded the present rush for
his Venetians and his rustic quietudes with
a Butlerian grin.
Frank Whysall, who has been appointed
Deputy-P.M.G. m Sydney, knows his j.,b, at
any rate. Entering the old State serv.ee as
a youngster in Sydney, he specialised in tele-
graphy, and handled thousands of press mes-
sages. They sent him to Broken Hill to
manage the wires during the silver boom, arid
he did it so well that his success in the De-
partment was assured. There isn’t a branch
of the service that he hasn’t handled: after
having had charge of the biggest country
stations he was sent to Sydney to organ se
the telephone service (and lost 2st. in the
process) ; and he has been superintendent of
mails, D.P.M.G. in Westralia, chief clerk in
N. S. Wales, and for some time past acting-
head of the Department in Sydney.
James Daniel Connolly, who gives way to
Colebatch after Agent-Generaling for vV.A.
since 1916, is a Queenslander by birth and
something of a hustler by nature. He arrived
at Coolgardie in the roaring days with little
equipment beyond that of a bush carpenter,
but he was not long in blossoming out as a
contractor, and some of Kalgoorlie’s most
solid buildings are of his construction. Arriv-
ing in Parliament in 1901, half-a-dozen yers
later he found himself Colonial Secretary, for
no particular reason except that one or two
goldfields members were wanted in the
Moore-Wilson Cabinet. But the choice was
not unhappy, for, while lacking in the minor
graces that keep so many politicians n the
limelight, Connolly proved himself a pains-
taking administrator with a good business
headpiece. As a post-prandial or any other
sort of orator, it may be doubted if W.A.
ever had a less imposing rep. in London, but
his industry might have earned him a third
term if Colebatch, Premier Mitchell’s right-
hand man, hadn’t set his heart on tlm Lon-
don job. The retiring A.-G. is credited with
large interests in city property in Ins own
State.
Benj. Berry, who let go his hold on life
the other day, at 67, was the second s n of
Graham Berry, once the tribune of the Vic.
people; but he inherited none of his dad’s
ambition, ard lived in the .cloistered security
of a pay-office clerk or sub-Treusury boss
for 47 years. His widow is a politician, and
has put in some solid work for the Gnashers.
Franc.s Davison, of Mt. Gambler (8.A..),
must be pretty nearly Australia’s champion
long-distance lawyer. He is 84, has been in
the State since he was 12 months old, was
admitted in March, 1862, and still assumes
the Johnny Walker attitude in the chasing
of Costs, with an occasional spell as special
magistrate.
Passed through Sydney the other day on
his way to the Anglican Church C ngress in
Maoriland, Vedanayaga Samuel Azariah, of
Dornakal, the first Indian bishop of the
Anglican Church. Ilis father ad ipted Chris-
tianity in boyhood, and was for many years
in the service of the C.M.S. The dusky bish.,
who holds Cambridge degrees, is 49, and was
ordained 11 years ago. Like most Indians,
he can talk —Lord, how they can talk !
Sister Liguori’s friend, the Rev. William
Touchell, of Kogarah (N.S.W.), has rece.ved
the reward of his star performance during the
last season of “The Escaped Nun” in being
made vice-president of the Protestant Fed-
eration. Ness, M.L.A., is president. Apart
from his anti-Rome kink, Touchell is a hum-
orous and kindly man, whose “spare room”
rarely lacks a tenant. Invariably the dead-
beat waits until after the last train has gone
before he knocks the household up to tell his
pathetic story; otherwise he might be given
his fare and a note to one of the city hostels
—and the lodging in a private house is much
more comfortable. Touchell knows the trick,
but —well, what can a man do?
Francis Villeneuve Smith, Adelaide’s bril-
liant K.C., who is off on a trip to the Cold
Country, is 38 and a nephew of the
talented uncle who was Tasmania’s Chief
Justice for 25 years. Prior to leaving he gave
evidence before the Law Reform Commis-
sion. Though it is generally understood that
he can command for certain eases bigger fees
than any other man in Adelaide, he declared
that the most he has ever had was 300
guineas on the brief, with 30 guineas a day
—he got that in the Cowan and Bickford
cases. He declares further that in all his
experience he has only once suspected jury-
squaring. All the same, he would drop juries
in civil cases.
Clifton Cornish, one of the four survivors
from the wrecked Amy Turner —they had
to do 1000 miles in an open boat —has twice
previously been nearly plucked by Davy
Jones. During a gale awhile back, his
jersey got caught in a wirefall which carried
away, and the young mariner went part of
the way with it. Another time he was wo?'k-
ing on a limejuicer which reached po t months
overdue after being almost engulfed several
times. Though now only 25 he was in the
line-up against the Kaiser, and was twice
out of action through wounejs and gas. He
now well deserves a quiet life, but being
hardy and adventurous will probably be
heard of soon as falling off Mt. Everest.
The Tas. ’Varsity now has on its staff
two MacAulays, father and son. Alex,
MacAuiay, the father, is known among mathe-
matic-ans as toe autuor of several heavy-
weight treat.ses, and is a Master of Arts.
The son, a Doctor of Philosophy, has re-
turned to the ’Varsity, at which tie graduated
in 1916, to serve as Dean of the Faculty
of Science, and at commem. the other day
delighted the irreverent undergrads with
the amazing mill Very attaching to his degree.
COHEN, K.C., of the Vic. Bar.
To make room for A. H. Merrin as Sec.
of Mines, the Vic. Ministry has induced
Dickson to transfer to the Chief Sec.’s De-
partment, whose throne became vacant when
C. S. McPherson was made Service Commis-
sioner. Merrin will still be also Chief In-
spector of Mines, so £,750 a year will, appa-
rently, be saved. The imperturbable Dickson
is in his (54th year, abd has about 18 months
to go. The only man who ever ruffled! him
was Drysdale Brown —but Brown as a Min-
ister cculd be a very trying person.
John Cameron McPhee, who is throwing
up the Ch.ef Secretary’s portfolio in the
Speck, has held it for nine months only, and
his seat in Parliament for but four years.
His brief but stormy Cabinet career —all the
public controversies of his time raged round
his departments, and he has had to grant
two lioyal Commissions, one on hospitals
and the other on railways—comes to an end
because of the demands of his private type-
writer-agency business. He will be remem-
bered as a hard-working Minister who wasn’t
in politics long enough to wear out his
natural enthusiasm.
“Beamish” sees the writing on the paper:
Priminister Bruce’s signature has changed a bit,
since I first saw it on an exercise-book at Melbourne
Grammar School. In those days “S. M. Bruce”
was written in a large, round hand, like Sweet
Seventeen’s label on the home-made jam. Now the
signature is engagingly masculine. The S is
indistinguishable from an I, the M is sharp-
pointed and breathless, and “Bruce,” led by the slim,
narrow-waisted B, hurries impatiently to its des-
tination. Not all the signatures of public men have
grown up. “W. A. Watt” looks as if if has hardly
emerged from the schoolroom. “P. G. Stewart” is
artlessly juvenile and the young Minister’s pals,
Gibson and Page, write their names in a plain, no-
nonsense-about-me manner. I well remember my
first sight of “W. M. Hughes.” It was appended
to a note to David Low, asking for the original of
one of his Bulletin cartoons. The signature was
so suggestive of an unkempt junior that Low thought
the letter was a hoax. But it turned out to be the
dinkum Billy, who asked his merciless depredator for
a picture which ironically re< ognised the l.ttle man’s
influence over the Cabinet of the day.
“Rienzi”: Reading “10-2-4’s” memory of
John Norton (B. 10/5/’23) I was reminded
of that bullet-headed freak’s persistent Napo-
leonic pose. As a short-lived member of his
Melbourne staff I had the displeasure of see-
ing Him in two or three of his rages, which
frightened everybody but the calm and seem-
ingly' mouse-like editor who was running the
Melbourne edition of Truth at that time.
One day the pair were discussing a new
plan of suburban distribution. Norton, m
his Napoleonic great coat, was posed over a
map of the city, no doubt feeing that he
was preparing another Austerlitz or Jena.
Perhaps his editor had the same feeling, for,
when John had heard the other’s proposal
and had sarcastically remarked “Very clever,
and what’ll you do after that?” his nettled
subordinate looked uo with his faded eyes
and said auietly: “I suggest, sire, that we
send for Soult or Massena, or perhaps bring
up Ney with the Old Guard.” It was the
neatest gibe I have ever heard, and. to gwe
Norton his due he was tickled by it. By
God, Blank,” he said, “that was unexpected.
You’ve got a sense of humor, after all.

Yet in himself he’ll be an ad.,

To set Chicago in a roar,

“S.E.”: “J.A.’s” incident of old blackbirds
apparently poisoning their captive youngster with
nightshade berries (B. 26/4/’23) recalls the experi-
ence of a friend at Colo (N.S.W.). He caught two
NO BALM IN GILEAD.
“I was almost drowned last week, and lost everything I
had except a bottle of whisky.”
“Well, that’s some consolation.”

young butcher-birds, and kept them in a cage on
the verandah. Morning and evening the oldsters used
to feed them regularly, and they thrived. One day
the owner heard a great commotion, and discovered
the parents engaged in taking off from the verandah-
rail, making short flights, and then coming to the
cage and scolding the kids, who fluttered about and
made a fuss. This went on for over half-an-hour,
and after a lot of shrieking the old people left. Their
efforts to teach their offspring aviation had evidently
disgusted them. At eventide they came back and
fed .the captives as usual, and next morning there
were two birdlets with their tootsies turned to the
roof of the cage. And never after the fateful evening
did the old birds visit the verandah.
“Ringer”: My nomination for the Animals'
Derby (B. 19/4/’23) is a half-g.own emu (corn
fed). A couple of months ago —I blush to own it —
I was feeding a couple of ’chase-horses on the sly
for a grass-fed meeting, when I noticed that my corn
was mysteriously disappearing. Next day I kept
watch, and soon saw a half-grown emu poking along
in a bee-line for the feed. Saddling up old Hard
Times I reckoned on giving him a bit of a pipe-
opener chasing the bird. He got one. Hard Times
can’t fly, but he can catch a swallow; yet he had
no chance with that emu, and after a couple of
furlongs I pulled out a bad second.

“Nollig” : Wiri had received unskilful in-
structions concerning the use of gelignite as a fish-
ing aid. He rowed out a short distance and dropped
overboard six plugs of the explosive, then sat there
awaiting results. When he came to, AViri was
somewhere near highwater mark. “My oats!” he
said, “t’at te biggest eart’quakes I ever see!”
* ■* • •
“Sucre”: “Ileredot” (B. 26/4/’23) wants
to know what’s to prevent a person being turned, inad-
vertently, into a frog-farm. Nothing. A youth of 14,
living at Oxley Creek, near Brisbane, sickened
gradually, and No. 1 Sawbones diagnosed his com-
plaint as the “growing” disease; but, as strange
wrigglings took place in his stomach, No. 2 Saw-
bones, who was joined up in the case, decided on a
very powerful emetic. He shrewdly suspected a
young frog doing high jumps over the lad’s last
meal. The lively tenant was ejected, but turned
out to be a brown snake 7in. long. Then the lad
remembered drinking from Oxley Creek without a
utensil. Presumably he had swallowed a snake’s
egg, and duly incubated it. To-day that snake is
coffined in a glass jar in a well-known chemist’s
window in Brisbane.

“Pick”: If the other weight-judging ex-
perts have all been nominated, let me introduce the
real champion—Jack Roberts, rabbit grader at the
Bungendore (N.S.W.) Freezing AVorks. An argument
as to the weight of a bundle of bunny pelts first
attracted my attention to the wonder. Roberts bal-
anced them on his flipper, estimated them at 11 Jib.,
and the scales proved him correct. For'a drinks-all-
round wager he then gave us a demonstration of
hand-weighing rabbits. From the heaps thrown out
for grading, he selected one after another, three
dozen bunnies, named their weights, which varied
from IJ to 3J lb., and threw them on the scales for
verification. Not in one instancy was he a fraction out.
“Two Blacks”: “Gulliver” (B. 26/4/’23)
wants to know why a bullock invariably has longer
horns than a 1 bull. May I in turn ask why a merino
rain has long horns and a wether
hasn’t ? Some of those who answer
“Qulliver” are going to talk
learnedly about the effects of cas-
tration, so it’s as well to trot
the jumbuelt into the ring early.
* * *
“Betterave”: Despite
“S.S.” (B. 26/4/’23) the case is
not proved. Cousins of mine lost
a child 14 months old through
snakebite about 20 years ago in
South Queensland. The kiddy was
put out in the garden for the fresh
air, and was struck on the ankle,
probably by a black snake (they
were plentiful thereabouts).
“S.S.” claimed that snakes do
not usually bite kiddies ; I would
go all the way—and further.
They don’t usually bite anybody
—in fact, it’s hard to get bitten
by some varieties. The whip-
snake and the green are so shy
that it is only the very unfor-
tunate or the extremely spry who
can be bitten. Except during the
mating season the black and
brown will always avoid trouble
if at all possible. ThO death-
adder doesn’t care a dump whether
you want to get bitten or not —
he will oblige either way. I
know of an instance when five
scrub-cutters, going in single file,
stepped over a death-adder lying
on a log across the track. A dog
following the last man was more
observant, and died because he
was also inquisitive. The tiger ; s
the bull-ant of the tribe. He’d
rather scrap than go around. The
carpet-snake, on the other hand,
is a very easy-going bloke, and
can readily be domesticated—-
many farmers keep them as living
mousetraps. The largest I’ve seen
so kept was a stout 16-footer. He
allowed himself to be freely
handled, but the old cocky told
me “Never pinch the extreme end of his tail.” I didn’t.
* * * *
“H.E.R.”: Re “H.M.’s” inquiry (B.
12/4/’23) for the origin of the term “So long.”
The expression is equivalent to the French au revoir
and not to good-bye, as stated by “H.M.” Apropos
of this, years ago a Bananaland squatter had handed
the cook his cheque after the season’s clip, when
the babbler said: “Oh, well, s’long, boss.” The
cooking had been vile, and the boss glared at his
late chef. “Never mind about your so-long,” he
6aid; “you blanky well make it for ever.”
THE WAY OF IT.
BROTHER TRELOAR: “That be good sermon thee preached last Sunday, brother Trembath.
Beats me how ’ee put um together.”
BROTHER TERMBATH ( local preacher) : “Well, I takes my text and divides my sermon
into three parts. In the first part I tell 'em what I’m going to tell ’em. In
the second part — well, I tell ’em. And in the third part I tell ’em what I’ve
told ’em.”
“W.D.G.”: “Huffin-Guffin (B. 29/3/’23)
should have a look round the stations in western
N. S. Wales before he goes crook about no shade
trees in sheep paddocks. In the hottest weather
he will find the jumbucks lying about wells and
dams, with the sun pouring down on them from early
in the morning till about 4 o’clock in the afternoon,
while there are plenty of shade trees quite close.
They prefer to stay in the sun near the water. In
any case, how many out of a mob under a tree
get the shade? I often come across anything up
to a couple of thousand camped close to small trees,
with only about a dozen getting any shade; still the
rest will camp there all day in the sun, even though
shade to cover the lot may be only a few hundred
yards off. I am speaking of merino sheep—perhaps
Lincolns or crossbreds are different.

“Bendoc”: Up goes the barrier for the
Largest Haystack Stakes. My entry is from Ballan
(Vic.), where, on Toper’s farm, there stands a stack
264 ft. long and weighing 600 tons. At ruling
market rates its value is about £2OOO.
* * * *
“FY7”: “Colub’s” lice-like insects on his
black snake (B. 19/4/’23) were the usual ticks
which infest reptiles. These are generally at their
worst when the host is, as “Colub’s” snake was, in
poor condition; but whether the tick is cause or
effect it is hard to say. As a general thing, how-
ever, bush animals like the kangaroo become hor-
ribly infested with ticks in very bad seasons. In
the ’eighties the ’roos were very plentiful on the
Baroop (Q.), and they died in thousands from the
drought, which gave everything a bad time in that
decade. Their scalps were worth 6d. each, and of
-the many corpses I collected from, most were covered
with huge, swollen ticks. Wallabies and kangaroo-
rats were as bad, though ’possums seemed to be free
from the curse.
* * * *
“Pantagruel”: Queer accidents are still
happening. A six-year-old youngster at Glasshouse
Mountains (Q.) was playing in the yard near a cow,
when Strawberry flicked her tail, which caught
around the child’s neck. The cOw made off, drag-
ging the child, who was strangled.
* * * *
“Ccilub” : On the north-eastern coast of New
Guinea there is a scorpion which for virulence of
venom puts all other varieties in the shade. It
differs from the majority of well-known kinds in that
the barb on its tail is much larger and perfectly
straight, instead of being curved. The stripes on
its back would suggest that it is closely related to
the exceedingly poisonous variety Buthus quinquis-
triatus; but other characteristics point to a close
relationship with B. afer. There are a number of
cases on record of its sting having caused the death
of an adult. Once a native, after havift." been stung
on the foot, died within two hours, though in most
instances death has not occurred till about 24 hours.
The action of the venom seems to be mostly on the
muscles and the motor centres, for death is usually
preceded by severe muscular twitch ings, like those
caused by some of the vegetable alkaloidal poisons.
Practically the only treatment is with potassium
permanganate applied to the incised area of the sting,
but this is not of much value unless put into effect
pretty promptly.
* * * #
“Vakatawa” : Down at the local store the
other day one of our mob brought up the Abo. argu-
ment about a person’s weight before and after eat-
ing, and to settle it we decided to weigh a man
who was known to scale list. 121 b. ordinarily, and
had just consumed a large meal. We found him to
be exactly 12st. 21b. Amid a chorus of “I told you
so’s” we heard the voice of the storekeeper from
inside: “Wait a minute, you chaps, till I set those
scales—l was buying rice this morning.”
“Bouragi”: “Longfella Boss”s” sawfish
(B. 19/'4/’23), caught in the fresh-water holes at
Nelia Ponds (N.Q.), recalls that in 1905 the K.M.
at Tamata station, on the Mamba River, N.E.
Papua, caught a 3 ft. sawfish in Tamata Creek.
Tamata was a mile and a half from the main river,
and the junction with the creek is 40 miles from
the sea, with at least 35 miles of fresh water in the
driest seasons. The sawfish must have been a bit
seedy, for he was cruising on the top of the water,
and was easily collected by a handy native fish-
spear,

“Herodot”: Dog-owners scratch their
heads over the quantity of strychnine in the form
of nux vomica or one of the salts which a canine
can sometimes stand. A dose which will act only
as a tonic on one animal will kill another stone
dead, even though they are about # the same body-
weight. Moreover, tho susceptibility of the same
dog will often vary considerably, so that a dose
may either improve it or make it sick, according
to the time the drug is given. Recently a vet. in a
North Coast (N.S.W.) town struck trouble when
a valuable dog entrusted to his care died from a dose
of l-16th of a grain of the hydrochloride, notwith-
standing that it had. frequently been given much
greater quantities. Another peculiarity with regard to
the drug is the susceptibility of the dog to cumula-
tive action. After each dose a small portion remains un-
excreted, and this is stored up until there is suffi-
cient to cause the death Of the tyke. The be-,
idea seems to be not to give strychnine to Towser
at all, despite its great value in the treatment of
certain sicknesses.
A WARNING.
THE VISITING GENIUS: “ Those beastly
shearers wanted to shear me.”
THE OVERSEER: “Well, yer better keep away
from the machine-shed, too. I noticed old
Bill oiling the reaper and binder.”
“Caesar”: The Camboon (Q.) coach once
arrived in Cracko minus a wheel-cap. The cap was
afterwards picked up at the starting-place in Cam-
boon. The coach did the distance (18 miles) with-
out mishap. If that isn’t a record it’s pretty close
to it.

“Caesar” : It was probably dampness which
lured the blowflies to “Jesmond’s” nap (B.
19/4/’23). Blankets which are left lying about on
damp ground often attract flies in this way. Let
“Jesmond” try hanging the blankets, singly', on a
line in the hot sun.
“Keystring”: For real brains give me the
dingo. On Spring Grove estate, Casino district
(.N.S.W.), in tiie early ’eighties, dingoes were very
troublesome, so the owners got a specially-bred
hound —three-quarters stag and one-quarter bull —
which the breeder claimed would clean the place up.
Although this brute would finish-off a dingo in no
time, he used to go bush occasionally'. Early one
morning a lady dingo was seen emerging from an
old shed about 70 yards from the house, and less
than 50 y'ards from a hut in which an employ'ee
slept. Wondering what she had been doing in the
shed, one of the boys went in and found a healthy
family of five imps, all bearing the distinctive
blue-and-white markings of the prized killer. The
lady, knowing that plenty of tucker could be pro-
cured near the homestead —cattle were killed on the

“Only at the hook end!”
place for beef every week —apparently concluded
that dad could more easily fiill the cupboard than
she, so transferred the family to his doorstep. As I
saw the pups on the morning they were brought
home, I can vouch for this.
“Yacko” : We have heard of all the aged
shearers; how’s this for the youngest ? Cecil Buick,
of Kangaroo Island (S.A.), did his 20 sheep a day
13 years ago, when only eight. Though the jum-
bucks were held in the orthodox way, the ordinary-
sized blades required both the lad’s hands to work
them. Since he was 11 young Buick has killed
and dressed several sheep a week. What he doesn’t
know about the animal seems hardly worth stopping
to pick up.
“FY7”: “Ben’s” miraculous shot at a
dingo (B. 3/5/’23) recalls a similar wild fluke of
my own. One afternoon, on Noondoo station
(S.-W. Q.), I was following up a batch of half-a-
dozen plain turkeys which kept alternately running,
flying and alighting (it was a very dry season and
they were hungry), but always out of range. After
about half-an-hour of it I at last in disgust loosed
off a shot with the .32 Winchester, as a sort of
sailors’ valedictory. The range was 600 or 700 yards
and I didn’t bother to look over the sights. The bullet
landed far beyond the mob, which took flight—save
one which, to my amazement, dropped in his tracks.
When picked up the fowl had a crease across tiie
black patch on top of his head, the bullet having
outed him without penetrating the skull.
• » * *
“Dr. Nil”: If “Hayseed” (B. 5/4/’23)
re-reads my note re fallowing and using manure (B.
l/3/’23) he will see that I do not say or imply that
fallowing was not practised in the Balaklava
(S.A.) district prior to 1891. My advice had
reference to manuring, and especially chemical manur-
ing, in combination with fallowing. The usual cus-
tom up till then was not to fallow but to “spell”
the land, i.e., put stock on it for a season or so to
eat off what should have been ploughed in as green
manure. That is not “fallowing.” When the
cockies were using virgin soil they grew splendid
crops, no doubt; but when I reached Balaklava,
before manure was used, 10 bushels to the acre was
considered a magnificent crop from old land.
«• * * *
“Valamac”: “Allbutt’s” staked sheep (B.
12/4/’23) reminded me of a peculiar piece of mulga
that was shown to me by W. J. Orchard (Blackall,
().). It was about 7in. long, lin. thick, and looked
as if it had been beautifully smoothed and polished.
He found it in the stomach of a fat wether that he
was killing for rations. Evidently the sheep had
swallowed the stick, for there was no trace of a
wound on any part of the body.
“X2X”: In districts where huge swarms
of insects flutter about lights at night a simple
method of checking the pests is to put bright-red
shades over the lamps. For some unknown reason the
wave-lengths at the red end of the spectrum repel the
majority of insects instead of attracting them. If a white
light and a red light are placed, say, six feet apart
when the insects ave on the wing it will be found that,
while the white is thickly clustered with them, the
red is left strictly alone. The tip should prove
handy in the sugar-cane districts of N. Queensland,
where special gauze-wire devices have sometimes to
be placed over an ordinary lamp to keep away the
myriads of winged nuisances.
* » * •
“Benicia” (M.L.) : The case for the sur-
vival of the tuatara is not nearly so hopeless as
“Centurion” makes out
(B. 5/4/’23). On the
mainland, except in cap-
tivity, he is a mere
memory, but for 12 years
he has been carefully pro-
tected on a number of
islands. The light-keepers
on Stephens Island and
the Brothers, in Cook
Straits, have the added
dignity of being “Special
Protectors of the Tua-
tara,” and are paid a
small annual honorarium
by the Department of In-
ternal Affairs, with subsi-
dies for the destruction of
hawks and cats. (A minor
pest is the kingfisher, who
has a fondness for the
young lizards.) The keep-
ers take an intelligent in-
terest in their side-line,
and make periodical re-
ports, from which infor-
mation of scientific value
is occasionally gleaned.
There is now clear evi-
dence that the tuatara is
increasing on these islands,
and on one particular
rock, in the Bay of
Plenty, he has always been
tiumerous enough to defy
raids by picnickers and
so-called scientists. Tua-
taras from Stephens Island
are now being liberated
on other selected islands
with every prospect of
success, and requests for
them from scientific insti-
tutions abroad no longer
meet with a generous reception.
“Merle”: Tell “J.A.” (B. 26/4/’23), who
found poisonous berries in a cage after the death of
a young blackbird which had been fed by. its
parents from without, that the verdict is “murder,”
though this is the first time I’ve known a black-
bird to figure in the dock. In many parts of Eng-
land the rearing of songsters is a profitable pastime,
the skylark in particular being in great demand.
Thrushes and blackbirds, not being particular about
their tucker, are usually fed by hand a few days
after hatching, thus eliminating the possibility of
infanticide on the part of the parents. On the other
hand, the skylark must be fed on small insects, con-
sequently there is no alternative but to let the
parents do it. The nest containing the youngsters is
put in a specially-constructed cage, which is placed
near the original home-site. All goes well till
“running time” —skylarks, breeding on the ground,
run before learning to fly—usually three weeks from
hatching; then immediately the parents find that
the youngsters can’t join them for a trial spin, they
administer the fatal dose.
A CONSIDERATE FATHER-IN-LAW.
COUSIN JACE: “ Company’ll ’ave to pay braave hit of compensation
to ole-man Treloar’s ’lotions, won’t [?]!"
INSPECTOR: “Yes,-I expect it will mean £300.”
C.J.: “Lucky job ’e fell down, shaft and, got killed, wad den ’cf His
dottor ’Lizbeth do he my wife, y’Jnaw.”
“Ento”: Tell “Pat Bushie” (B. 26/4/’23)
that there are estimated to be about 200,000 species
of two-winged flies in Australia, and he, describing'
it as “blood-red with yellow wings, about the size of
a blue-bottle,” asks what one of these may be. I
know eight or ten kinds that the meagre description
would fit, and, curiously enough, one is a blue-bottle.
As to Patrick’s comment on the red lice which he
found on flies and which he thought came from star-
lings that had nested beneatli ins roof, red lice
(mites) infest flies, beetles, butterflies and many
other insects, and are commonly seen by those who
have eyes for minute objects. But the ruddy little
fellows referred to by Pat may not necessarily have
any co.nnection with his birds of lousy reputation.
If they have it is significant to note that the fly is
generally considered to be acting merely as an aerial
transport—so possibly the lice from the nest were
seeking new realms to conquer. Larger creatures,
notably pseudo-scorpions, are sometimes seen hang-
ing on to the legs of flies, similarly seeking pas-
tures new. Add the spread of many diseases attri-
buted to its agency, and the house fly is pretty hard
to beat in the insect world as a universal carrier.
“Spenner” : A cocky at Mumbannar(Vic.)
has been milking a cow continuously since 1914.
During the nine years she has shown no inclination
to flirt with William, and has given about the same
quantity of milk each year. Is there anything to
beat it?
» * • *
“Country Ped”: Tell “Mugski” (B.
19/4/’23) that the grasshopper changes his skin, not
once, but several times in the course of his existence.
The ’hopper comes from the egg as a perfect insect,
and so does not go through the grub and chrysalis’
stages of growth. As he grows his coat bursts,
and the; ’hopper climbs out of it in a complete new
suit. Its': is because of this growth that there are
little ’hoppers and big uns. Probably “Mugski”
thought >they were different species.
“Te Whare”: Re “E. J.D.’s” (B. 19/4/’23)
black snakes with white and greyish bellies homing-
in the Pilliga scrub (NrS'.W.) ; my snake with the
dirty-white vest was peculiar as occurring in a
quarter of the South ('oast (N.S.W.) haunted only
by the carmine-bellied black snake. Nevertheless it
was probably a mere color-variation. The Pilliga
snakes may be a different breed of the genus
Pseudechis. There are at least eight varieties of
black snake, of which the fierce snake (PseudedMs
ferox ) has a yellowish-white belly. This serpent
homes in northern N. S. Wales.

“FY7”: Re “Tin Hat’s” who
shot his horse and cowered behind it with his best
girl, to avoid being trampled to death by 2000
'merino sheep (B. 12/4/’23). I was once backing
into a mob of crossbred wethers, to induce them to
start through: a paddock gate. Somehow I slipped
on my face as the rush started, and the whole mob
went over me, cutting my clothes and a lot of my
skin to ribbons. A sheep’s hooves are knife-edged,
and as many of the jumbucks, in their usual follow-
my-leader fashion, leapt frolicsomely into the air
before landing on my breathless carcase, the sharp
edges registered full effect. It took days to get
the stiffness out, and years to live down the igno-
miny among my mates.
“ Jackeroo”: A grazier at Goondiwindi
(Q.) couldn't sell his
cattle, so he recently
offered 100 head to a
neighbor for nothing
if he would take them
away. The neighbor
inspected the stock,
then remarked: “You
know, cattle are hard
to get rid of ; but i’ll
take delivery within
three days provided
you give me a rejec-
tion of 20 per cent.”
This is on a par with
a yarn that Donald
Gunn tells. In 1892-
93, when sheep were
almost given away.
Welltown station sold
40,000 old ewes at a
bob a head, and he
got some at that price.
He culled the worst
out and intended to
kill them. At the
time there were many
abos. about Boolarwell,
and one day he said
to Steve, king of the
tribe, “If you like I’ll
give you an old ewe
or two every time we
kill.” The first kill-
ing-night Steve and a
mate came and killed,
dressed and took away
a sheep. The next
night the abos. seemed
indifferent about kill-
ing. On the third
occasion Steve came to
Donald and said:
“Mine tinkit, boss, you
not fair longa blaek-
fella—you ask ’i m
work for nothing. Me
bin make you good
offer. S’pose you get
white fella butcher kill
’im sheep, we eat ’im.”

“Azrim” : Toll “Jim Dandy” (B. 19/4/’23)
that I’ve never denied the existence of the expec-
torating reptile in Kaffirland. But I assert vehe-
mently that death or blindness does not follow the
introduction of its venom into the optic. “J.D.’s”
nig., whose eye swelled rapidly but subsided when
bathed with a strong solution of potassium perman-
ganate, corroborates Noguchi’s experiments (B.
15/2/’23), that “nothing untoward happens except
an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which rapidly
responds to treatment.” If .lames has an authentic,
case supporting the Kaffir legend (of blindness or
death) 1 shall be glad to hear from him.
“Chumos” post-mortems a loud noise: —
lie “Exul’s” mysterious explosion when an iron
drum was cut into with an oxy-acetylene blowpipe
(B. 2G/4/’23). There arc three possibilities, all of
which would help: (1) The blowpipe flame would
raise the enclosed air to a temperature of perhaps
600 deg., which would result in an internal pres-
sure of three atmospheres (451 b. per square inch).
(2) Any sulphuric acid remaining in the tank would
be decomposed, at the temperature produced, form-
ing steam, sulphur dioxide' and oxygen, and these
products would increase the pressure two atmospheres
(301 b. per square inch). (3) So-called concentrated
sulphuric acid always contains sufficient water to
cause it to re-act with iron to produce hydrogen.
The latter at high temperatures explodes violently

showing that little more than 3oz. sulphuric acid

OUR SUBURB PRAYS FOR RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“We’re needing rain,” said Cassidy.
The land lay' in the grip of Drouth —
Six months had passed since scudding clouds
Swirled low across the harbor mouth.
Gone was the grass, dun was the view ;
Sheep panted in the noonday' heat;
Dust-storms and Willy-willys played
Where last year flourished fields of wheat.
Great cracks and fissures lined the beds
Of streams that long had ceased to flow ;
Swift bullets gave to stock release —
Feed’s cost as high as hopes were low.
Time passed. The outlook blacker grew.
Hope changed to grief and dull despair.
From ev’ry church within the land
Went up a daily moan of prayer.
A sudden change: the dark clouds low
Came scudding o’er the harbor mouth;
Drawn, haggard faces smiled as fell
The cooling moisture from the south.
“Send it down, Hugh!” said Cassidy—
“We want another inch of rain
At least to soften up the turf,
That footballers may start to train.”
Then gazing out into the storm,
Watching the lightning storm-clouds chasing—
“ Perhaps just half an inch will do;
Don’t send too much to spoil the racing.”

_the motor owner
is to be envied!
His or her machine is available at all
hours for all classes of work—whether
it be a city run for business or plea-
sure or more extended journeys in the
country. The modem car is highly efficient,
easy of control, and when “ Railroad ”
dm
are used, practically free of trouble. Many
motorists now drive thousands of miles without
need of spanner or pump, so great is the efficiency
of the modern car, and “Railroad” Dunlops.
Freedom from tyre trouble is one of the great
features of “Dunlops,” and their quality, strength
and construction ensure long mileage. Half
the motorists of Australia use them, and judging
by the ever increasing demand for more
“ Dunlops,” the other half is> beginning to realise
that it pays to use these dependable covers and
tubes. All garages can supply in beaded edge
or straight-sided types.

Over a thousand pounds went into the
treasury of the White City courts on Satur-
day afternoon. With O’Hara Wood, Patter-
son and Anderson at the nets, not to speak
of countryman Seiler, the courts proved as
attractive to the tennis fiend as a Doug Fair-
banks and Mary Pickford combination would
to the movie “fan.” The four great stands
were crowded to overflowing: even at 9
o’clock on Saturday morning not a 7s. 6d.
seat was to be had for love or money. Pat-
terson is the girls’ favorite —“lie’s as graceful
and lithe as a tiger,” one flapper gushed—
but O’Hara Wood has the halo of impend-
ing romance about his head. Anderson is
admired, but in a strictly professional spirit.
His wife is a front-seater at his triumphs.
Woollen coats and skirts were the fashion-
able wear, with furs from every beast that
grows. An innovation that will bear repeti-
tion was the spreading of tea-tables on the
lawn outside the pavilion. These were deco-
rated with the new species of paper flower—
and that’s as different from its old-fashioned
sister as a cauliflower from a cabbage rose.
The Feminist Club bared its arms, drew
on its slippers and metamorphosed itself into
a dancing sprite on Saturday night. Ruby
Rich, in the absence of Miss Preston Stanley,
did the Hostess act, and clothed it in black
velvet and ermine and a new style of hair-
dressing—the thatch stands out in puffs like
small wings above each ear. A cheery friend-
liness glowed through the gathering, and even
the misguided girl who arrived without a
partner got the loan of somebody else’s man
for a turn or two. With true Australian
irreverence, the two young men at the violin
and. piano syncopated everything—one
wouldn’t have been surprised to find oneself
jazzing to Chopin’s Funeral March. Mrs.
Wolfe-Carius kept an eye on affairs, and Mrs.
St. John kept two on a son who was quite
the prize jazzer in the room.
The Royal Hospital for Women collected
the gate money from the big skating carnival
held at Centennial Rink, Bondi, last week.
Posters and fancy costumes with no ulterior
motive flew noiselessly around the big floor
bathed in a rosy glow from hundreds of
softly-shaded lights, and State Governor
Davidson’s kiddies did their dash with the
best of them. Dame Margaret viewed the
revels in grey frocking behind a presentation
cluster of pink roses. The Carruthers dame,
in grass-green, smart Mrs. Edmund Playfair
(who flung an ermine wrap over a glittering
mass of jet frocking) and Mrs. Alfred Lee
judged the variegated attire with a view to
prize-distribution. Hospital-secretary Roseby,
Mrs. Bladen and the visiting Cadbury couple
were other notables among the lookers-on.
The National Council of Women handed
complimentary food and speeches to Lady
Forster and Dame Margaret the other day.
The idea, which originated in the brain of
Processor MacCallum’s wife, proved a great
potstick, for nearly 200 women were stirred
to consume the lunch spread by Farmer’s.
The principal item on the bill, besides the
food, was a heart-to-heart talk by Mrs. Dale
on the work of the League of Nations. The
G. lady made a graceful acknowledg-
ment for herself and Dame Margaret, and
then Dr. Elsie Dalyell—a plumper Elsie
than when she first came back to Australia
from the starving countries of Europe—
clutching her little presentation bowpot (and
probably reckoning up how many Viennese
babies could have been fed with the cost of
it) made the speech of the gathering. “To
Australia she owed her chance of getting to
the places where she could prove what she
could do. To Australia she intended to give
the best that was in her.”
The Colonial Institute, having draped itself
in flags and dahlias, the latter as big as
a movie-girl’s smile, passed the fatted cream-
puff to the G.-G. and his pleasant lady the
other afternoon. The Institute’s bigwigs,
H. R. Denison, Albert Gould, George Earp,
and others, were prominent in the crush that
filled; the Bligh-street haven. A musical pre-
liminary broke the ice. A small, neat-looking
aide dogged his lord’s steps, and the Kelso
Kings were unobtrusively amongst those who
also ran.
The dinner to the judges of the pictures
for the Royal Academy show given by the
Cavalier Club on Monday night was more
than a mere congratulatory meal. It was a
symbol of peace and unity. The inclusion of
John Longstaff among the judges has pla-
eated the dissentients of the Royal Art
Society, and Hans Heysen will go to
England with the knowledge that he
has behind him the support of every official
art body in the Commonwealth. The gift
show at Farmers’ in aid of the venture has
been a great success. There are only about
a dozen pictures unsold out of the 120 offered
by the artists, which means that something
over £5(10 will be available for the fund. It
was an odd circumstance, by the way, that
the only two artists who did not offer pic-
tures to the show were George Lambert and
John Longstaff. It is understood to be their
silent protest against their exclusion from
the Archibald Prize competition.
A hundred students of the Teachers’ Train-
ing College are at Camden, and in Camden
the Students’ Camp is reckoned an event
of almost the same standing as the local
show. In fact, it is in the show grounds
that the students have entrenched them-
selves. One reason for the selection of the
Onslow stronghold is that Camden is sur-
rounded by many small rural schools. To
these the students journey by train and car
each day, and in the universities of 10 to
20 pupils they practise teaching under just
those conditions which they will experience
when fully fledged. Sport and pleasure go
hand in hand with the heady occupations.
General-organiser R. G. Cameron is sup-
ported by a strong staff.
The fete, dies hard in Sydney. Not till
the westerlies are upon us will the charity
organiser give up this type of quick money-
getter. This week-end saw two more. One
in the pretty grounds of Ascham, in aid of
the Girls’ Friendly Hostel, was opened
by Associate-Premier Earle Page’s wife, and
strongly supported by Justice Gordon’s— his
mother had been a worker in the Girls'
1 riendly cause for 50 years. Archgaiters
Wright and Alfred Meeks gave a cheer or
two for the women stallholders, who included
the headlights of the Anglican aristocracy.
Another fete was held at St. Aloysius’s Col-
lege in aid. of the school’s memorial playing-
fields. This was opened by the Papal dele-
gate, who had to make his way through a
hall so seething with enthusiasts'that he was
forced to gird his robes round him, else he’d
have arrived on the platform like St. Martin.
Ihe fund, though it will benefit greatly by
the fete, is by no means complete, and any
ex-student with a cheque to spare may post
it to the old address.
The death of Miss Ethel Trouton has
bereft Sydney of a diligent worker for many
good causes. Her favorite interests were the
Bush Book
Club, the
liawson Insti-
tute and 'the
G.F.S., and
latterly the
Girl Guide
movement was
her great en-
thusi a s m.
With her good
works, practi-
cal common-
sense and
laughter went
hand in hand ;
and the gath-
ering at South
Head was one
of the largest
that place of
long rest has
ever seen.
Miss Trouton’s
father was that Captain F. EL Trouton who
for many years was first a skipper with and
then manager of the old A. S. N. Company.
Tier brother Garde is one of the oldest in-
habitants of the Royal Sydney Yacht Club.
Before this letter slips into her pink cami.
Hilda Caro will be Mrs. Harold Weigall.
The match is the rounding-off of a romance
that started years ago when he was reading
law and she was fluffing at her first parties.
The two have a great circle of friends, and
the presents are positively ravishing—crystal,
china (one Royal Worcester set, hundreds of
years old), cheques that run to a comfortable
banking-account, handbags, gorgeously illus-
trated books. A Chinese pendant, kingfisher-
biue feather on filigree silver and coral pink,
came from old Eligh-Schoohnistress Mrs.
Garvnn, and some luscious fox-skins from an
old Backbloeks friend, to whom Hilda has
sent Tiie "Bully” every week for years. And
jewellery, furniture and Heaven alone knows
what! St. Mark’s, Darling Point, was picked
as the scene of the wedding, Scott Fletcher
being no longer available at the ’Varsity.
Elilda’s frock was a charming affair of heavy
silk crepe, yellum-toned, her veil an exquisite
thing of Limerick lace, and she had decided
on red roses for her bouquet. Tall, dark-
sister Renee’s bridesmaid’s frock was of yel-
low taffetas, and that was associated with
yellow roses. A family party at Hilda’s
home, catered for by Renee’s pet charity,
the Children’s Elospital Cafe, was to finish
the flutter. Harold is one of the lawyers
associated with Allen. Allen and Hemsley,
and a son of Sydney Grammar's most famous
headmaster. Elilda is a B.A. of Sydney Uni.,
an active member of the National Council of
Women and a great worker for the invalid
soldier.
There’s one Warrawee girl who doesn’t
mind facing the back-to-nature outlook, and
she’s Lorna Allen, who married Herbert
Hudson at St. James’s the other night,
dressed in all the traditional fluffings of
satin and lace, and with Padre Micklem and
a squadron of choristers to see to the knot-
tying. Daisy Carter bridesmaided in rosy
taffetas, and the ’groom was sustained by
brother Stuart. Boggabri will be the new
Mrs. Hudson’s address.
At St. Andrew’s, Colombo, Lilian Gordon
Wright, eldest daughter of Mrs. Wright, of
Springfield, Neutral Bay, married Philip
Neville Warren, son of a former Surveyor-
General of Ceylon, midway through last
month. Lilian clothed herself for the event
in cream and primrose georgette over prim-
rose crepe de Chine, the diapings caught by
silver roses with a Limerick lace veil and
an armful of white tropieai flowers and
asparagus fern. The reception was held at
the Galle Face, and among the guests from
Sydney were Mr. and Mrs. E. Pickering and
Mrs. John Harris. The bride’s future address
is Nannoya, Ceylon.
Another May bride will be pretty Vida
Edwards, daughter of a Bondi medicine-man.
Until recently Vida was a member of
Williamson musical comedy companies.
Her husband-to-be is Donald Austin, dentist
to the Navy. Even the bulldogs must have
their molars massaged.
Mrs. Sherwood is enthusiastic over her
visit to Queensland, where her headquarters
were Mount Morgan. There she was the
guest of the mine-manager Boyds, and her
chief dissipation, besides wild draughts of
scenery, was the open-air picture show, to
which everybody save the very young goes
armed with cushion or rug as a buffer be-
tween body and bench. (Sydney Town Hall
audiences might copy—and add a tomahawk
to operate on the Siamese chairs.) The
artist has just sold her painting, “The
Model,” to her native Maoriland, in which
chilly land her master was Van der Velden.
She plans to take a few canvases under her
arm when she goes across to Wellington at
the end of the year for niece Jean Mac-
donald’s wedding. Jean is the daughter of
that Colonel Macdonald who, during the wax*,
was sent to look after defence matters in
the South Island. The young man in the
case is Jock Hutchison, the medico son of
the tall editor of the Otago Daily Times.
David Jones’s Miss O’Keefe drops a line
from Rome, where, besides visiting cathe-
drals and historic marble halls, she had an
audience with the Pope. The reception she
attended was a large one —three great rooms
crowded with men and women, mostly
Amei-ican. The present pontiff, who is de-
scribed as rather short and chubby-looking,
made his entry impressively, a red-robed
cardinal on eaclx side of his own cream-clad
person, with a squad of the ornamental
Swiss Guards in attendance. An invitation
race meeting, where the beautiful horses
were ridden by officers of swagger cavalry
regiments, wrings an exclamation or two
from her. There were no flat races —only
hurdle and steeple. The women who attended
were smartly tailored, small-hatted, luxuri-
ously furred, all black-shod, with grey or
beige hose.
Philip Wilson, to whose tenor voice high-
brow Sydney used to listen, is engaged in
educating the musically uneducated. For
the British Broadcasting Co. he is giving a
series of lectures, in which history and
music are blended, and he lets himself go
when it comes to comparing the ancient
songs and the modern. Philip, stouter than
of yore, has spent a good deal of the last
year in the British Museum, where he has
been collecting old Elizabethan songs. In
collaboration with Peter Warlock, he has
brought out a bookful of them.
Violinist Pechotsch was sorely hit by the
Great War. His two sons, Eric and Rai-
mund, were in Kitchener’s army, and one
of them will never return from France. Rai-
mund’s wife is a fine musician, and was at
one time a well-known soprano. She is
mother of barrister Willie Curtis, though
sometimes people are apt to forget it, taking
them for sister and brother.
A group of flappers on one of the steamers
following the races at the G.P.S. head-of-
the river event struck a new note in barrack-
ing. Not content with yards of ribbon pinned
to their dresses and worked into their hats,
they had jazz garters in the colors of
their favorite school. In order that these
evidences of partisanship should not be over-
looked, they each swung a leg over the rail.
The legs were particularly shapely, and the
demure young things seemed as properly
proud of them as they were of the Grammar
School crew whose colors they wok'.
The ball on the Ceramic to benefit the
Crown-street Woman’s Plospital promises to
be the flutter of the season. There’s to be
a pageant of all the fancy costumes, led by
the Governor-General’s lady, which will
break up into tableaux vivants on the pro-
menade deck, where the dancing will be held.
Dalgety’s wharf is to be turned into some-
thing like an old-fashioned fair. And there
are to be three bands —one paid for by the
Waley lady, one by Mrs. Tony Hordern,
another with the hat money from Mrs. Monte
Severn’s bridge afternoon.
June 12 is the date picked by the Old
Boys of the Shore C. of E. Grammar for
their yearly dance in aid of the schools
memorial playing fields. The Wentworth
is the rendezvous.
Mosman Musical Society lately persuaded
A. H. Norman to return to the post of com
ductor, which he gave up in 1915 after 12
years’ service; and there w r as a crowded
house to hear a capital performance of
“Pepita” on Monday night, with Dome
Ward scoring another of her numerous suc-
cesses. Mr. Norman was born in Melbourne,
but grew up in
Maoriland,
where he be-
came leader of
the Dunedin
Orchestral
.Society—to the
Islanders this
is almost the
equivalent o f
wielding the
baton of a
Sousa. (Inci-
dentally, singer
Amy Murphy’s
grand-dad
founded this
society, and
Amy’s mother
was for a long
time the prize
songbird of its
concerts.) The
R.C. Cathe-
dral moored to
one of the ledges of the precipice of Rat-
tray-street had its choir shepherded by Nor-
man ; but later he forsook St. Joseph’s for
the more lowly Anglican St. Paul’s, which
is only 5000 feet or so above sea-level. In
Sydney Norman joined Ilazon’s orchestra;
and he has the reputation of being a con-
ductor who will have his way—which, really,
is what a conductor is for.
The Australian Mothercraft Society—
Plunket System—is now in full swing, with
Sister McMillan in charge from Monday till
Friday. It hangs its sign out on the fourth
floor of Mofßtt Chambers, Elizabeth-street.
The Ryde Home for Incurables is to
benefit this year by a Butterfly Ball which
is to flutter its wings in the Town Hall
early in August. A committee is getting
things, under way, and the Home’s consist-
ent friend Fred Searle is no doubt at the
back of the rumor that the scheme of decora-
tion is to be something unusual.
Somebody questions the Letter’s statement
that the poem “The Bravest Thing God
Ever. Made’’ was written by Will Ogilvie.
But it’s true. The inspiring phrase is said
to have been first uttered by a British
officer after he had seen Billjim in action:
and catching the fire of it the singer built
his fine war-poem. Ogilvie, a Scot, spent a
few years in Australia, and still dreams of it.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Barrister A. D. Graham forsook Law for Literature
the other day, and arranged a “Shakspeare’s
heroines” evening in the Centennial Hall, which shook
off something of its fixed expression of hoary age
for the, occasion. The character of Ophelia was
omitted from the list as a tribute to the late Mrs.
Lacaze, who had always played that part for the
Shakspeare Society. A daughter 0 f the late Mervyn
Jones, skipper of the Merry England (her mother
was one of the handsome Pollards of Warwick), took
the part of Portia ; Mrs. P. J. Symes made a dash-
ing Rosalind, Miss Mactaggart was Celia, Nell
Douglas-Graham the mournful Constance, and Misses
Lockhart Gibson and Agnes Finney were the Merry
Wives. In the highbrow atmosphere a number of
girls from the Grammar School and the Lourdres
Convent bore up bravely, while Society was repre-
sented by Dr. Robertson and his spouse, Mrs. J. L.
Wooleock and others.
Somnolent Bulimba is to waken itself with a
grand shivoo on June 4 for the fund to put up a
memorial to its soldiers. A hundred pounds was won
for this object at a ball the other evening, when
Bulimba surprised itself by jazzing.
there was a braw gathering at the Auchenflower
courts to witness the inter-State tennis matches, and
rank and fashion gave smiling patronage. On the
same day Ascot blossomed for the May meeting. Lady
Lauder, in cream satin and jade, was an imposing
figure, and E. J. Carroll’s lady wore navy with a
gold turban.
The De Tisnes have taken T. J. Ryan’s old home
at Auchenflower, which looks as though there is
money in mumming.
Tom Heney arose to speak of Australian novelists
he had known before a muster of the authors and
artists of Queensland the other day. Mrs. Tom
beamed upon her lord, and in the hall were Steele’.
Rudd, Jack Matthews, Francis Kenna, Mrs. Cumbrae
Stewart, the J. D. Cookes, M. Forrest, G. A. Collard,
E. Colclougli, Ashton Murphy, Marshall, Bennett,
Henri Tardent and other pen-pushers. Prof. Stable
w’as also there to compliment the Telegraph’s edi-
tor on his talk.
Roses wreathed the table set for Mrs. Maldwvn
Davies’s party to tennis-player Gerald Patterson at
the Bellevue. The following ribbon-and-jazz evening
was the means of handing over a goodly sum to- the
funds of the Mater public hospital. Mrs. Bellevue
Finnigan lent the ground floor; Lieut.-Gov. Lennon's
wife took an active part, and the T. J. Ryan widow
also did her bit, with pretty Mrs. Jack Ffhelly to
help. Pink and gold chrysanthemums and colored
lights backgrounded the 600 whirling couples.

to the tqne 60,000 eminine p er claA"*
Q —3 Tip-tapping daintily on City pavements, striding lustily over country
tracks, tripping to and fro on the tasks of office and home, gliding gracefully
through the mazes of the Ball Room, treading in dignified unhaste the ways of the
circle of leisure, a fresh relay of 60,000 feminine feet each day steps out a new
stage on the road that marks the way of Progress for all things Australian —for
that is the true meaning of the fact that the capacity production of Bond’s
Australian-made Hosiery has reached the astonishing total of 30,000 pairs per day!
And that item, “30,000 pairs per day,” does signify “Progress” in the truest sense of the
term, for it represents the materialisation of an ideal through the co-operation of the
community, an ideal of Service which has actuated the makers of Bond’s Hosiery from the
beginning of their enterprise, and which has become a very real thing through* the whole-
hearted co-operation of the womenfolk of Australia.
Its tangible effect on Australian Progress is indicated by the fact that 1200
Australians are engaged in the manufacture of Bond’s Hosiery, and that £4OOO
per week, which must otherwise have largely gone to the foreigner, is going instead
into the pockets of Australian Wage-earners, while the Australian Woman s
immediate reward for her co-operation is that Silk Hosiery is obtainable at a much
lower cost per pair and per year, through Bond’s Australian-made Hosiery.

Melbourne Grammar took the whole bunch
of rowing laurels in the Head-of-the-Kiver
frenzy. Not content with do.ng the hat
trick, with wins by their third, second and
first eights, they scored a fourth trick when
the “Old Boys” crew, stroked by Johnnie
Campbell (who twice pulled a light blue oar
in the Oxford-Cambndge classic), just man-
aged to squeeze their craft ahead of Wesley.
Thereafter the massed crowds covering the
boatsheds and bank became a mere back-
ground for a surging, chortling mass of dark-
blue-capped youth. Ex-Senator Fairbairn
handed over the cup on the boat-house bal-
cony, while headmaster Frankiin beamed
appreciatively in the rear.
For Boatrace Night Her Majesty’s was
togged opt with trillions of. yards of school
colors, backed by a forest of vegetatiop, and
all under a giddy canopy of floating balloons
topped by four school flags, with the Mel-
bourne Grammar and Scotch banners flank-
ing the stage boxes. After the dimmer had
been applied for the first act, Priminlster
Bruce and his wife, who had been feeding'
the Grammar crew and their head at South
Yarra, sidled in, followed by their boy
guests. (The lengthy headmaster side-
tracked the theatre.) Thereupon the whole
show was held up to allow thunderous
applause to be showered on the youthful
heroes. Paper caps in weird designs had
been hancjed out to youngsters in the audi-
ence, while the lolly boys made rich profit in
colored streamers at 6d. a roll. These streamers
were hurled recklessly in all directions and
the stage was often a chaotic tangle of
paper. The thrill of the evening was the
movie introduction to the second act, when
the audience saw the great event of the day
re-rowed for them on the screen. All the
best parents were there. Charlie Wenman
buzzed in now and then to see how the eyes
of youth regarded “The Arcadians,” for
which he cherishes a particular affection, as
he staged the first Australian edition for
Meynell and Gunn umpteen years ago, when
Maie Sydney starred as Sombra, now played
by the titjan-haired Kathlyn Hilliard. Kath-
lyn, by the way, indignantly repudiates the
suggestion recently put forward that her
phlogistic locks are not rooted to her scalp.
Scotch, Wesley and Xavier celebrated at
the Princess’s by hurling defiant war-cries
at one another and reels of colored paper at
the artists, every hit they registered in a
fender place being received with chortles of
approval. Hugh Ward had effectively deco-
rated the interior with flowers, balloons and
large golden lanterns, and one of the boats,
spspended from the ceiling, hung across the
gallery like a monstrous cigar. The place
>yas crammed, and the “O Brien” co. gal-
lantly bore up against a rain of interruptions
and strove to disentangle themselves from
the ribbons of paper that would twine insidi-
ously round their legs wherever they walked.
The interval was made rather distended and
glum by g collection of choruses sung by a
half-hearted house. These proceedings were
led by Scotch’s standard-bearer, who hollered
encouragement under an absurd paper hat.
Sir Arthur Stanley, with some complimen-
tary remarks and a cheery smile, launched an
exhibition of pictures by the late Miss Hen-
rietta Irvine, sister of the Lieut.-Governor.
The lady globe-trotted extensively, and this
little show, at the Artists’ Society gallery,
represented many of her impressions of
people and places. Lady Stanley, up to the
eyes in furs, was there, and so were the Irv n$
dame and her newly-engaged daughter, who
received congrats, in grey tailorings. After-
wards the Irvines hostessed a select tea-
party at the Alexandra Club.
: The Mayoral Swansons have planted heavy
footmarks on the civic sands by inviting
the wives and daughters of the city fathers
to the Town Hall quarterly dinners. They
spread the May feast in the old CouncJ
Chamber the other niglit, when the food was
served in a yellow floral setting, with
Eastern-patterned shades for the lamps.
Nearly all the feminine guests were in black,
the Mayoress’s little lot being brightened
with jet decorations. Mrs. Charlie Atk ns
wore silk swathings and the Hennessy dame
trailed velvet; Mrs. Arthur Wesley was an
inky dazzle weighted with jet, while Mrs.
Jimmy Dyer was in fleecy black. After the
eating the womenfolk were handed coffee in
the Alayoress’s parlor while the men had
their smokes in peace. (Now that the frivol-
ous sex have taken to the cigarette habit
mere man never knows when he will be asked
to share his smoking moments with the dear
things. Some hostesses pre.er m.xed smok-
ing ; but few men do. Anyway, the feminine
cigarette is becoming taboo in blue-blo.;ded
circles in England, not because it is naughty,
but because it is too usual to be smart any
longer.) Later on mus.cal noises were made
by Walter Kirby, Doris Mclnnes and Agnes
O’Keefe; and Margaret Kerr unwound some
recitations. The Cabena and Stapely pan's
were missing from the revel; ex-Mayor Aik-
man came without his ex-Mayoress niece,
Mrs. Stein, who is mourning the loss of a
devoted mother; and Dr. Kent Hughes was
not supported by his feminine halt.
The Donald Mackinnon pair will be en-
gulfed in a whirlpool of farewell shivoos
before they start out for Washington.
Handsome Mrs. Donald—she is a daughter
of the late Judge Bunny, and sister of artist
Rupert—should mane a pleasurable impres-
sion on the official set over yonder. The
younger Mackinnon daughter, Marie, who
goes with mum aud dad, is an attractive
young thing whose flapper wings were neatly
trimmed at a French seminary.
Music Club members under the baton of
vice-president Fritz Hart extended the wel-
coming hand to Jean Gerardy and his wife
in the Lyceum parlors the other evening.
The place was crowded. Unluckily the ’cello-
ist’s sex prevented the welcomes being
weighted with a floral trophy, but the re-
sourceful Fritz, feeling that something should
be done, came to the rescue with a Crystal
Palace concert programme on which the
name of “Master Gerardy, ’celloist,” is listed
—a scrap of paper which has been treasured
in the Hart collection for 62 years. Madame,
a daughter of Sydney’s Harry McQuade,
wears a startling resemblance to the Richard
Casey widow, having the same dark blue
eyes, soft voice and ingratiating manner. A
youthful edition, of course. Since her mar-
riage she has acquired a restful distinction
of the finest European brand. She trailed
slinky black chiffonery under a bewitching
petunia wrap to match her wide head-band.
Mrs. Hart, with a lace scarf enmeshing her
misty blue draperies, and hon. sec. Muriel
Campbell buzzed about seeing that every
one was having a good time, and the affair
wore a gentle air of Bohemianism which
allowed the stars to roam round, getting-
acquainted with everyone. Music by Ger-
trude Healey and Muriel Cheek, with cakes
and coffee, topped off the shivoo in good
style.
Evelyn Dawson, who sailed late last year
to visit brother Keith at the G.H.Q. of the
Indian Army at Quetta, has been heard of.
She is lengthening her travels to London,
calling en route to say how-do to Mrs.
Maurice Browning (one of the Mentone Gil-
lespie girls) in Madras. Captain Keith Daw-
son, an ex-C. of E. Grammar School boy,
after shedding the A.I.F. khaki, joined the
Indian Army, and now aides General Bird-
wood.
Mrs. Osborne, wife of the Professor of
Physiology, the other day secured her medi-
cal degree with honors in three subjects, be-
sides halving the Fulton Exhib’tion in obstet-
rics and gynaecology with little Kathleen
Dal v. She
already owned
the degree of
Master of Sci-
ence, acqu'red
at Leeds. Mrs.
Osborne, who
two stren-
uous war years
in a munition-
factory, is a
many - sided
matrop, as
keenly inter-
ested in home
and mother-
hood as the
least brainy of
her sex. Every
work-morning
sees her motor-
ing her kiddies
to school; she
is a model
hons ekeeper,
and, further, presides over the local College
of Domest.c r.conoiny and the Bell-street
Domestic Arts centre. This picture of the
versatile lady was made by Rembrandt —the
photographer; not the gentleman who is
alleged to have done a little painting some
time ago.
Captain Ronald Macdonald handed cousin
Essa D’Ebro over to our new City Regis-
trar, Arthur Barraclough, at St. Kilda All
Saints’, where the scarlet decorat; ve effects
would have gladdened the soul of the red
ragger. The bride, who is built on amp’e
lines, was encased in pnk silk, which
blushed timidly through veilings and sub-
veilings of white georgette patterned on the
top layer with velvet, and anchored to the
shoulders with slender attachments of brilli-
ants. A girdle of pearls offered equatorial
suggestions, while several yards of white
satin floated from one plump shoulder blade,
under a tulle veil, held captive to hrown
locks by three narrow streams of brilliants.
A floral trophy of red roses struck a rebel-
lious note against the pinky-white curtain-
mgs. Pretty little Doris Umpnelby ’maided
in amber velvet and a brocaded hat wreathed
with golden foliage, wnile brother Frank
Barraclough stood by the ’groom. Norman
Bradshaw s s.lvery tenor, backed by Cecil
l’arkes’s fiddle, cheered the registry-signing
interval. The D Ebro widow staged the
bindal feast in a marquee on her Toorak
lawn, where she hostessed in velvet of a
Lvely blue and a black hat laden with white
ospreys. The bridegroom's, mother lightened
her inky coverings with a cherry-colored
posy. speech-time came round Mrs.
D’Ebro spoke her own thanks, and did it
well. She is a daughter of the late Dr.
Tracey, a famous Collins-street medico, and
was one of the firmest pr ps of the dear old
Wimmen’s League until but that’s another
story.
Here is a Montea th portrait of Blamire
Young, who returned to .Australia in the
Ceramic. While abroad he was a regular
exhibitor at the Royal Academy—his “March
of Hunger”
was one of the
pictures of the
year in 1920
—and he also
showed wfith
the Inter-
national Soci-
ety of Sculp-
tors, Painters
and Gravers.
Young, who is a
Cambridge
M.A., first
came to Aus-
tralia to teacl
mathematics at
Katoomba
(N.S.W.), and
while there he
built a studio
which was
shared for a
time by Phil
May. He in-
troduced the artistic poster here in associa-
tion with Lionel Lindsay and Harry Weston,
whose “Boomerang Brandy” sheet was the
first typical Australian poster. The Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide and Geelong galleries
have examples of Young’s water-color, a
medium in which he has done some brilliant
and always distinctive work.
Larry Rentoul, who led the non-unionists
at the Scotchbyterian Assembly and won the
battle, complained the day afterwards that
somebody had annexed his hat and left a
mere apology of a tile in its place. As the
size of the substitute was smaller than his
own he had come to the conclusion that it
belonged to a unionist. Another meenister
—a unionist —retorted in a whisper that it
was possible victory had swelled the head
of “th’ wee doctor o’ Ormond College.”
A “welcome” afternoon of tea and song, in
honor of Lady Forbes Robertson, was staged
at the Austral Salon before a full house. The
star guest, who convoyed daughter Anne
McLean, clad her slim elegance in black
silky checks, defied the cold snap with a top-
dessing of fur, and flew an ostrich feather
from the lee side of her velvet hat. Daugh-
ter Anne, who is less, colorful than her
mother, surmounted a navy frock and a dark
fur coat with a velvet hat of sapphire blue.
Mrs. Quinnell led the pair to the front stalls
with honeyed words and floral presentations
giddily bound with the Salon colors. The
company was entitled to its smile when the
leading lady prefaced a flow of thanks with
“I am not accustomed to speaking in pub-
lic.” Music and recitation were released by
Charlotte Hemming, Norman Bradshaw,
Cecil I’arkes and Myndell Isaacs, with an
interval for tea and chatter, and presumably
Lady Robertson and her Anne enjoyed
themselves, as they saw the whole thing
through.
The J. G. Mitchells, of Rheola, Elwood,
have waved a long farewell to their young-
est chick, Dorothy. She swore herself away
to a young Dutchman. P. A. Schorer, at the
local Anglican chapel, St. Bede’s, a few weeks
back, and has now set out with her bride-
groom to wander east and west before mak-
ing for the land of windmills to get
acquainted with her new ’in-laws.
Mrs. Meryl Lister, the ex-lady tennis
champion, who had the bad luck to be outed
by ’citis about the end of the last tourna-
ment ; n Melbourne, has suffered another
visitation, this tiiqe by one or more mis-
creants, who wrecked the interior of her
home in Malvern, burrowed among her pri-
vate papers, including letters from her hus-
band who was killed in the war, and behaved
with general outrageousness. The fact that,
the garden hose was .chopped into short
lengths, while tap-heads were wrenched,
might suggest an aimless maniac, though it
is all possibly the work of a disappointed burg-
lar, as, owing to the lady’s illness, the house
was unoccupied and all the valuables had
been removed. Pat O’Hara Wood, who is
a great friend of Mrs. Lister, will be grieved
to learn of this latest shock to her system.
It is about time that the women forced
someone in authority to take notice of the
hideous massacre which masquerades m
Keiaug as sport. Cnforiunate gaians, navmj?
been caught in the paddocks, are in
crates until wanted, when they are carted, a
crying mass, to the shambles, where they a®
used m trap-snoot.ng. Tne “sport” with the
gun doesn't always get a kill with his first
barrel, but breaks a wing or shoots off a leg or
something of the kind, and as he cannot
claim his bird until it is dead, a bottle, stick
or any other article handy is hurled at the
beautiful agonised little quarry to make it
rise for its second dose of lead. It is notori-
ous that most of the men who keep
this gruesome “sport” going are of the
“make-a-bit” type, the real objective being
the bett ng. Nothing can be said in favqr
of the degrading business. Even the claim
that the galahs are pests in the wheat area
does not whitewash such wholesale bru-
tality. No decent man on the land advo-
cates it.
Mrs. Charles Prescott, only daughter of the
Alwyn Valentines, of Heyington House,
Tooiak, has sailed with her three boys and
her husband to the U.S.A. Be is the Aus-
tralian representative of the American Gen-
eral Electric Co., and has been called to
headquarters at Rochester, N.Y. Ida Pres-
cott met this Irish-American engineer on the
boat which brought her back from a “finish-
ing” trip to Europe in 1914. He was thqn
coming this way to install the signals on the
new eiectiuc trains in Melbourne.
The annual flower of intrigue for the Gaud
Mayoral position has burst early into bloona.
For some weeks past the Herald has dropped
hints that Councillor W. Brunton is as good
as elected to the robes which Swanson will
reluctantly abandon in November. The
idea, apparently, is to capture any wavering
vote by insisting upon the allegation that
Bruntoil aforesaid (no relation to the flour-
mill or to Dot, but something in the gal-
vanised-iron trade) is a hot favorite in the
coming struggle. Really the Obtrusive bid
for the billet is more humorous than any-
thing, since the election (by the 32 council-
lors) will not happen till next October. :
The crinoline has a few crowded minutes
of glorious advertisement in “Smilin’
Through” at the Royal. The scene in which
Gertrude Elliott perishes within half-an-hoUr
of her wedding is made unusually pictur-
esque by the billowing skirts of the ’sixties
in lemon, pale blue, green and lilac. The
damsel, who sits posed in the lilac, is a
dream of sweetness, and, incidentally, sup-
plies the one peep of passion in a parade of
sedate emotions. She rises and is approached
distantly by a young man who halts on the
edge of No Man’s Land, as it were, tenderly
addressing her as Alicia. Her response is
a little flirtatious turn of the shoulder and
the gentle casting of her kerchief at the
feet of her adorer. Swooning almost with
happiness, but determined to have his feel-
ings in keeping with the period, he leans
over to bestow a chaste salute, but she swings
him into a bunny-hug clutch and gets home
a vampire’s torrid kiss. It leaves the swain
almost reeling and bilious, but it is a fine
moment —just a flicker of honest ardor that
accentuates the sickliness of after-events.
A eoo-ee from Adelaide:—
Lady Bridges is back from her Sydney jaunt. In
her absence there were two or three buck parties—a
dinner and lunch or two —at Government House.
Among the guests were Premier Barwell, half-a-dozen
racing-men, the Asehe heap and that Stanley colonel
whose present hobby is migration, and who had the
Engineers of the 4th Division under his wing in
France.
Seventeen young matrons took possession of the Nor-
wood Town Hall the other night, hung it with autumn
foliage and garlands of vine leaves and grapes, hid
the orchestra behind groves of oranges and pom-
egranates, banked masses of roses on to the supper-
tables and in every other available corner, and gave
a glitteringly successful ball. There were debs, in
p'enty, among them chicks from the nests of the Nat
Campbells, Edmund Bowmans, Keith Bowmans, Mrs.
Teesdale Smith and Alfred Ross. The Bridges bade
some of the hostesses to dinner at Government House
first (the H. H. Duttons, who are staying there; the
Ronald I Air gases, M. A. Fortheringhams, Norman
Brookmans, Wardens and Lance Lewises), and came
on in time to receive the bobs of the buds before the
first dance.
There was a Palais dance on the same night, its
object to raise funds for the ’Varsity crew’s trip to
Sydney. Here were mostly the youngest set —under-
grads. and their feminine belongings. Sidestalls for
balloons, caps (all in black and white, the ’Varsity
co’ors) and sweets brought in extra money, and the
committee went home with light hearts and heavy
pockets. j
Mrs. Hope Murray hostessed a tea-party at the
Wentworth rooms a few days ago in honor of about-
to-be-married Joyce Wald. Another shivoo with; a
similar intention took place at the Mostyn Evans
home in North Adelaide, with Mrs. Mostyn Evan and
Mrs. Laurie Gliddon as joint-hostesses.
A rainy opening of the Cup meeting brought put
winter finery—mostly coats and skirts, furs, topcoats
and a cape or two. Among the smartest frockers
were Mrs. Svdney Reid, in navy blue, with squirrel
furs; Mrs. John Corbin, in grey; Mrs. Leonard Lin-
don, in navy ; and Mrs. Cecil Fisher, in fawn. The
Bridges are keen racegoe-s, and his Ex. was there
both on the Saturday and Cup Day with the Medleys.

NEEDS
S.A. Jockey Club has had bad luck in the
recent (.abolition of an old unnecessary May holiday,
which is replaced by Anzae Day, and so the Adelaide
Cup was run this year on a casual Wednesday.
Attendance and totalisator suffered a little, but Were
equal to anything- before the last two occasions. The
literally prayed-for rain had just arrived, and the
heavy going seemed fatal to horses with lumps of
weight. Also King Ingoda, the locally-owned Mel-
bourne Cup winner, had run nowhere on the previous
Saturday at w.f.a. Yet the Comedy King horse carried
9st. 71b. to a comfortable victory by a length and a
half from the English chestnut Chaparral. It makes him
out a really good horse, for there were behind him
winners of Adelaide, Birthday, Perth and Hobart Cups,
all receiving a lot of weight. The tote returned
£8 3s. and £5 Is., in a field of 23; Mambray Lord,
prominent all the way and finishing a close third,
would have paid £76 if he had won. Sweet Doris,
from Westralia, had been backed down to 5 to 2;
Binbi, a Hobart Cup winner, was second favorite,
and King Ingoda third. The King has now won five
good races, totalling close on £14,000. The
Adelaide Cup carried £2OOO this year, its biggest
figure in this generation. But old-timers recall that
when Inglis’s Malm beat Thomas Elder’s Conjecture
in 1884 it carried £2500, all other local stakes
being starved to provide a big Cup.
“0.K.”: As an upset of recent form the victory
of King Ingoda was unsatisfactory, but as a con-
firmation of the King’s doings in the Spring it was
satisfactory in all respects. Even when the horse’s
victories at Flemington had been followed by his cap-
ture of the Williamstown Cup there were people who
declared that King Ingoda would never win another
race, because the weight was bound to stop him.
Had he been asked to carry a big burden at Williams-
town he would have failed, said the wise men. But
in the Adelaide Cup the plain-looking gee humped
the top weight, and to each of the other placed
horses he was giving 3st. Moreover, the 4th, sth and
6th had each 2st. or more the best of it with the
winner. It was mighty bad luck for three-year-old
The Cypher to have bumped up against such a good
thing as King Ingoda at 7st. lib. in the Melbourne
Cup. That is to say, such an occasional good thing.
Neither of the animals, that fought out the Melbourne
Cup finish is an everyday customer. Jn the matter,
of inconsistency there is little to choose between.them,
though perhaps The Cypher has the larger proportion
of disappointing races to his account.

“Wodgil”; Sam Maekay, Westralian squat-
ter and horseowner, fought hard against l the malady
which carried him off last week. A year ago his
condition was so desperate that the doctors told
him they would have to remove a limb, and that
with the aid of an anaesthetic which wouldn’t send
him to sleep. “All right,” said Sam, “get along
with it” ; and he smoked cigarettes and exchanged
badinage with the nurses while the grim wonc was
going on. The Mackays were among the earliest
pastoral settlers in North Westralia, and Sam made
his fortune long ago. He probably didn’t add to it
by his racing ventures, although Soutline won him
the Newmarket Handicap ana V.A.T.C. futurity
Stakes, and Radnor (V.It.C. St. Leger and second
in the Derbies to Beragoon) was another profitable
purchase. Other good ones in the Mackay stable
were Macadam (Perth and Australian Cups), Rath-
lea (Toorak Handicap and second in the Caulfield
Cup), Betsy Burke (W.A. Railway Stakes) and
Scotland, albeit it wa3 in bookie Jim Brennan’s
colors that the last-named landed his Newmarket.
Sam’s second wife was the dancer Fanny Dahgo
(otherwise Rudge), who brought him a son and heir.
Elsie Mackay, a daughter by his first wife, married
Lionel Atwill, the beauty actor (Sam named a horse
after him), and has herself made a stir on the
N’York stage.

The four-year-old Piastre gelding Penny-
bont, who had ran a rattling good race against
King’s Battery and King of the Forest at Rand-
wick, won the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Cup, at B’s, from
the favorite Hosier (another Piastre) and the Sea
Prince gelding Sea Risk. But backers of the
favorite would have collected had he been decently
ridden. Drawing No. 27 marble, he headed the
field at two furlongs, and was again rushed to the
front five furlongs from home. The result was that
he had nothing left to finish with. Punch Was
fourth, and last year’s winner, Lord Zell, was at the
tail-end of the field.
Stay-at-home punters could have won
£1792 in respect of the Rosehill (N.S.W.) races
by putting £1 s.p. on Toohey’s first mount, “all
up” on the next, and so on. And then they
would have had a thrilling run for the
money. 'The youth who has steered the last
three Doncaster Handicap winners had five rides and
ail were successful —Volpi at 15’s, Joviality at evens,
Fair Exchange and Lion Isle at 3’s, and Laskey at
5 to 2. Three of them were trained by Booth.
Toohey, herewith pictured, is an intelligent lad
who is refreshingly free from flashness, and doesn’t
believe in risking the stable’s money by cutting
things fine at the finish. He belongs to a sporting
family, pne member of which was a noted fiieldj
fighter before English P.R. rules had become obso-
lete, and another was a near-champion featherweight.
“Nemo”: Sydney coursing men are re-
marking on a coincidence. When the first Produce
Stakes was decided at Liverpool seven years ago
Beauty Spot was the winner and Milk Lady, a bitch
from Orange, runner-up. Last week-end Bold Beauty,
a Beauty Spot pup, and Hasty Bill, whose ma was
Mi k Lady, were the finalists in this year’s Stakes,
and Bold Beauty accounted for the Orange representa-
tive, as her mother had done before her. The Liver-
pool Stakes went to Shandon’s Hope, a son of im-
ported White Hope. He is owned and trained by a
policeman.
* * • *
“Fax”: If the two lighter college crews
ever had chances in the head-of-the-Warra competi-
tion, a strong head wind last Friday probably settled
them. Times for the heats were a guide to the
ultimate result. Melbourne Grammar, rowing
steadily from the outset, beat Wesley by a length
and more in 6min. llsee. Geelong Grammar, with an
attractive swing, beat Geelong College comfortably in
6min. 17see., whereas the beefy Scotch, an ill-
balanced lot, took 6min. 33see. to defeat the
Xavierians after a ding-dong finish. The argument
afterwards was, not that the smaller crew did par-
ticularly well in racing the big fellows to half a
boat’s length, but that, under the circumstances, the
Scotch must be a very rough and ragged crew not to
have won the heat easily. So it proved next day,
when the decider was rowed in smin. 5 4-1 sec.
Scotch never looked dangerous, whilst Melbourne
Grammar and Geelong Grammar made an always
interesting fight of it. A long spurt that the local
men put in at the half-mile, or thereabouts, decided
the issue. The Dark Blues gained a lead which
Geelong Grammar could never take from them. There
was plenty of pep in the Light Blues’ efforts in the
straight, but it was only for a time that they reduced
the Melbourne boys’ lead. When it came to the
very finish both crews were making the same pace.
Dark Blue was not yielding another inch of lead.
Cool and steady did the trick. Melbourne Grammar
had matured, during the last week of training, into
a really good crew.
“R.”: Eric Tulloch, coach of the Melbourne Gram
mar crew, was a rowing contemporary of Prime-
Minister Bruce. Eric is, I should say, the senior in
years, but he hasn’t lost his boyish expression,
whereas Bruce’s countenance has settled down in c.
sedate recognition of the honors and responsibilities
that have tumbled upon him. Tulloch was some-
thing of a footballer, by the way, but he hasn’t lost
his affection for the aquatic pastime. He is still
connected with the Albert Park Club, and a few
years ago figured in the State eight.
“Adelaide” : Democratic Australia ought to
take to its heart those Murray Bridge oarsmen who
represent S.A., and have several times proved too
good tor the best Australia can bring against them,
they nearly all earn their living by manual labor,
and so are barred from snobbish Henley; one <of the
two who don t is an officer on a Murray steamer,
and so is equally barred, as a worker “on or about
boats. Stroke is a practical carpenter, and makes
the boats his special care. The secret of thair
success seems to be (1) a crew seldom changed,
enough with two or three useful substitutes, in case
ot emergency; (2) a long, slow stroke, impressed
on themby coach Teddy Higgs, once of Tasmania;
(d) perfect training. “It’s positively uncanny,”
once said an Adelaide man who had rowed a plucky
losing race against them on their home river.
'Here were we all flat out at the finish. But they
just paddled on, to the wharf, and put their own
boat away in the shed; and then two of them took
their places in the town band and blew' on trom-
bones and things!”
“Wilfrido”: The monotony of the muni-
cipal elections at Wellington (M.h.) was brightened
b> an eistv\hile London tailor, who appealed for sup-
ground that he had been the only man
within <io years to invent a new style of riding
breeches, and that he was an English international
—at bowls. He bottomed the poll.
* * *
“Lilywhite”: What about this lot repre-
senting Australia in next year’s Olympic Games?
Beaurepaire (V.), Soussari (Q.), Charlton, Mina
Wylie and Ella Smith (N.S.W.), swimmers; Carr,
Sheaves (N.S.W.), Kent-Hughes, Kohlman (V.),
Hantke (W.A.), and Leitch (Tas.), runners; Demp-
sey, Benstead (N.S.W.), Munro (Q.) and Broadbent
(V.), cyclists; Anderson (N.S.W.), Patterson, O’Hara
Wood (V.), and the best of Hone (S.A.), Mclnnes,
Schlesinger (V.), Clemenger and Sieler (N.S.W.),
tennis players; the Murray Bridge (S.A.) eight;
Baynes (Q.) and Bull (N.S.W.), scullers; Braneourt,
Thomson (N.S.W.) a nd Peet (V.), boxers. Hitherto
Australia has never been properly represented in
the Games, but there would be nothing wrong with
a team picked from the foregoing—it would be worthy
of any country in the world. And we owe it to
the Diggers to cut a creditable figure in France.

Some huge masses of meat are throwing
§ loves at one another in America these days. Ai
ew York last week the resuscitated Jess'Willard,
who goes 6ft. 7in. from scalp to sole, and weighed
in at _ 17st. 101 b., stopped Floyd Johnson, a 14st.
man, in 11 rounds. Willard alleges that he is rising
36, but the critics declare that he will never see 40
again. However, his win over Johnson, who is at least
15 years younger, was rather impressive, for Johnson
has Slugged a ton or two of assorted heavyweights
through the ropes during the last 18 months. On
the day that Floyd bit the sawdust Jack McAuliffe,
another rising hope of U.S. pugdom, was knocked
cold in three rounds by Luis Angel Firpo, of Argen-
tina. Luis Angel is an ethereal creature who
measures 6ft. 3in., fights at 15st. 101 b., and has arms
like masts. He is to fight Willard next month.
* * * *
Since Jim Dwyer, the Queenslander, whip,
ped bald-headed Colin Bell for what was charitably
described as the heavyweight championship, he has
been twice beaten in short order—by Fonce Mexon, at
Newcastle (N.S.W.), and by Ern Waddy, at Adel-
aide. The fight with the Novoeastrian was an affair
of two-minute rounds, but the Waddy mill was
fought according to the plans and specifications of
championships, although it didn’t last a round.
Therefore Waddy has claimed the title, and
with Lloyd and Cook away (Lloyd has licked him
at least once) he has doubtless the best right to
it. But it is an empty honor nowadays.
* . * * *
Jack Dale, the 18-year-old Melbourne light-
weight, displayed exceptional toughness and relish
for the game in his match with Danny Morgan, of
Wales, at the Sydney Stadium. The affair supplied
60 minutes of fast and interesting fighting, and.
but for two knockdowns Dale scored in the 11th
round, the Welshman might have been entitled to a
draw. But those two blows tipped the balance in
the youngster’s favor. Morgan is alleged to be 24,
but looks older, The Stadium people gave him
little time to get acclimatised, and he deserves another
chance.

“Tantalus”; Kirkwood, the Australian
golfer, is having another cut at Britain’s open
championship. He failed in 1921 and again last
year, but some of the critics fancy him this time.
According to Bruce Kerr, who is a whale on golf
statistics, Kirkwood headed the list of averages for
big 1922 tournaments, with a score of 744, Dun-
can coming next with 75f, and Boomer third with
76 2-5. The low-lving course at Troon should suit
Joe’s particular style.

Considering that Melbourne is the home
of the Australian code of football, now supreme in
four States, and that the Saturday matches draw
five times the' number of people that attend Ihe
Rugby League games in Sydney, it is rather hopeless
to talk of establishing Rugby League by Yarra’s
banks. But the attempt is to be made by a hand of
enthusiasts headed by Harry Sunderland. Sunder-
land, who accompanied the last Rugby League team
to England, has any amount of energy. He has been
secretary of the Queensland Rugby League, the Q.
Cricket Association and the Q. Boxing Association.
He also organised the Bananaland end of the Y.M.C.A.
appeal during the war. But his present contract is
the toughest of his career.
* * * *
Tne worst shock of the day in Saturday’s
Melbourne football was sustained by-Carlton, whose
18, on their own ground, crashed before the despised
St. Kilda, a disaster which hadn’t happened them for
nine years. The game was fast, and in the last
quarter furious, but the Saints’ better training stood
to them, and the longer they played the further
ahead thev went. They ran out winners by 100
points to 56. The Old Blues haven’t got into their
stride yet. Collingwocd’s Magpies, also on their
own ground, found themselves 14 points to the bad
when the hell ended a fast and by no means cour-
teous game. Essendon’s teamwork; especially forward,
was superior, and their big men marked excellently.
’Don, 79 points ; ’Wood, 65. Fitzroy scraped home
from South Melbourne, and Melbourne routed Gee-
long. The sea aiders have the makings of a good
team, only it needs a lot of practice.
“Winkle”: Their defeat by Fitzroy, followed by
their debacle against St. Ivi’da, should convince Carl-
ton that Horry Clover is but human. The one en-
deavor, from the centre to the forward line, is to
get the ball to him. This would be a match-
winning system did all his opponents play otfly for
the ball, for Horry is an unequalled mark, but know
ing that their every effort is to frustrate the Oarltoi
champion, and if one does go up fairly with him
it is a mistake made in an .excited moment. It has
been found safer to go up one-handed and punch the
ball away. Other teams (Collingwood, with Dick
Lee, for instance) often used their crack as a lure,
and won many matches by playing to lesser bui
unguarded forwards. Carlton, however, adhere
strictly to their rigid system. Too-much-Clover has
lost them two premierships, and has given them the
worst of starts in the battle for the third, j.

D. J. (“Dinny”) Campbell, proprietor of
the pictured face and
form, was one of the
best centre three-
quarters N. S. Wales
has turned out. In
1910 he played for
Eastern Suburbs and
X.S.W. against the
"English team. In 1912
Leeds snapped him up,
and for eight years he
figured in the York-
shire club. Returning
to Australia in 1921,
Campbell again bogged
in for Eastern Suburbs,
and since retiring from
file game he has estab-
lished himself as a
capable writer and
coach, in which last
capacity lie has been
engaged by Temora, one
of the rising League
country centres.

trast to the family
combination compris-
ing the lleeside (W.A.)

South Sydney made a spectacular entry
into the Sydney Rugby League competition by rout-
ing Glebe. They set a smart pace from the kick-off
and kept enough in reserve to run all over the Reds
in the last quarter of an hour. At the finish they
had 18 points (4 tries 3 goals) to 7 (1 try 2 goals).
Their best man was Howard llallett, the old Kangaroo
full, who celebrated the commencement of his 14th
season of senior Rugby by breaking Glebe’s heart.
His long punts either found the line or had too
much “spin” to be cleanly bagged. Oscar Quinlevan,
the Manning River lad. was a tower of strength in
South's centre, and Gillespie was sound at stand-off'
half, but little Johnston was much below form. Roy
Liston and B. Gray were the Reds’ best forwards, and
Benson worked hard behind a raw pack. The re-
maining backs lacked initiative, and will require a
deal more coaching if the side is to win matches.
“Tren”: The agreement patched up last
year between Melbourne League and Associa-
tion, to prevent mercenary footballers chasing the big
money, or tp stop their using the threat of transfer
to increase their income from their old club, has
not been as successful as was anticipated. Players
have found a new outlet. They are now flocking
to the country, where the lowest salary for a man of
city reputation is £7 a week, with free board (and
beer if he wants it) at the local Menzies’. Craven,
last year’s captain of Geelong; C. Drummond, last
year’s captain of Collingwood; Twomey and Lums-
den, of the same team; Johnson, Carlton’s full-back ;
Schmidt, a star centre; Smith, captain of Northcote,
and nearly 50 others who have figured somewhere at
some time in metropolitan teams, have chosen this
easy life. On the other hand, Dick Lee, who retired
from Collingwood last year with hi s 700-odd goals,
has declined a Speck offer of £l2 a week, board, and
a benefit at the end of the season; also Cazaly, of
South, and Len Gale, of Fitzrov, both refused a
tenner from bush clubs. The Association is implor-
ing the League, which controls country football, to
make each player procure a permit before playing in
the bush. St. Kilda, wiser in their generation,
insist on players giving a legal undertaking to re-
main with the club until granted a clearance. It is
thought that this will stop the stampede.

“Wart”; “Ashmead” (B. 3/5/’23) is not
correct in saying that the Old Launeestonians were
turned down by the local Football Association. The ;
Ass.’s objection was that the Launeestonians would
draw their team almost entirely from the present
three clubs, but they were told they would be accepted
if they applied next year. Meantime they will
have an opportunity to dig up other players.
* * » *
“Bail”: Hobbs, the English cricketer, has
scored his hundredth century in first-class cricket.
He is now only four behind old Tom Hayward, but
he will have to go hard to beat Grace’s tailv of 126,
even though he is only 40 and probably has two or
three years’ cricket still in him. Hobbs, however, is
well ahead of any other contemporary English bat,
the nearest being Philip Mead, who has reached three
figures on 69 occasions. The best Australian per-
former is Warren Bardsley, who has knocked up 47
hundreds.
“Winkle”: Albert E, Cotter, the great fast
bowler, gets an honorable mention in Gullett’s
History of the Palestine campaign. In the chapter
dealing with the charge of the 4th and 12th Light
Horse that, at the eleventh hour, snatched Beersheba
from the Turks, this statement occurs:—
“The mounted stretcher-bearers rode forward, as \
they always did, with the advanced Light Horse
lines, and worked coolly in the midst of the dis-
mounted fight around the earthworks. Whiie so
engaged Private A. Cotter, the famous Sydney fast ;
bowler, was shot dead by a Turk at close range. As 1
has been recorded already, he had at the second
Gaza engagement been singled out for fine work ’
under heavy fire; he behaved in action as a man \
without fear.”
THE NATIONAL IDOL.

■•Siki, the Senegalese boxer, fell asleep in a Paris
cafe on Saturday, and when he suddenly awoke he
tired a revolver, causing a stampede. He appeared
at the races leading a lion, and the crowd fled until
he showed them the rope by which he was holding
the animal, upon which he was greeted affection-
ately. His fine for shooting at Calais has been paid
by admirers.” —News item.
In Paris when a restaurant is roused by piercing yel'.s,
And someone cries “A doctor! Quick! A waiter
has been shot!”
While turmoil, moans and language that suggest a
dozen hells
Pervade the crowded room, the diners do not care
a jot.
“It was the nigger
Who pulled the trigger,”
They murmur, as they turn again to soup or entrecote.
“If Siki, who would rather shoot than wash or
dine or dance,
Can’t have his fun while we sit here and have our
table d’hote,
Why, what will foreign sportsmen say about the
sports of France?’'’
The clamor of the organ fills the mighty Madeleine,
The music of the choir rings out and drowns its
thunderous notes:
When, lo ! an even louder noise distuibs the ancient
fane:
“It’s Siki!” cry affrightedly some fifteen hundred
throats;
“He has a lion,
This inky scion
“Of Senegal’s most famous house: its rope is half-

But dnstantly the voice is heard of all that’s best
in France:
“And if he has a lion, what’s it got to do with you?
For Heaven’s sake, shut up, and give our champion
a chance!”
At races, shows and cinemas the blackamoor is seen,
And sometimes he is sober, though more often he
is not.
At Longchamps he diverts himself by firing at a
queen:
At Auteuil it’s his chauffeur who attracts a passing

CONDITIONS upon which the
Proprietors of the Maitland and
Greta Collieries are prepared to
re-engage men at present on strike,
and reasons for same .
CO A guarantee from the various lodges in the northern dis-
trict branch of the Workers’ Industrial Union of Aus-
tralia (Mining Department) that strikes and other such
stoppages shall cease, and that pit top meetings shall
be discontinued.
The proprietors do not ask for a monetary
guarantee, but they claim that the Miners’ Federa-
tion should amend their rules so that if any of their
members cause a strike without the sanction of the
Executive, then such member shall be fined for
the first offence and expelled or otherwise dras-
tically dealt with for the second.
(2) The colliery managers shall select the men they require,
who shall sign on.
Every employer has the right to select the
labour he requires, capable and suitable to carry
out the duties required—no reasonable employee
objects to this. Mr. Justice Higgins has laid it
down as follows:
“The Court (Federal Arbitration Court)
leaves every employer . . . free to choose
his employees on their merits and according
to exigencies; free to make use of new
machines, or improved methods. . . .”
(3) The right of colliery managers to dismiss an employee
shall not be questioned.
This, also, is a right exercised by every em-
ployer in other industries, and such right is re-
cognised by all other Unions. If any victimisa-
tion were attempted the Commonwealth and State
Arbitration Courts fully protect the employee.
(4) All collieries at present idle to resume on the same day.
It is essential that all the collieries should
resume on the same day, otherwise certain com-
panies could be victimised without any redress,
because the miners could keep some pits idle and
thereby perpetuate the intolerable conditions which
have existed.
(5) All rates of pay and conditions of employment provided
for by any awards or agreements in operation to be ob-
served.
The proprietors are not attempting to alter
existing rates and conditions.
(6) All machinemen (subject to Clause 2) at all collieries
to start on the machines with the other employees.
Awards have been issued by the Coal Tri-
bunal providing the rates of paiy and conditions
of employment for working the latest and most
modern machines. The employees are not pre-
pared to accept these, and are seeking to impose
further increases and restrictions on their use. The
proprietors are not willing to keep idle modern
expensive machines.

THE INKY WAY.
Vision is a new Sydney quarterly, edited by Jack
Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor. It is what the' Tuia#
might be but for its Cromwellian directors in M.L.
—as naked as Manly beach in December, and as
unprovocative. Much of the matter is propaganda
designed to lure Australia to Hellenism:
“Here in Australia we are the inheritors of the
centuries just as much as any other people. We can
react to Homer and Theocritos just as gladly as
Keats; or, rather, if external circumstances have any-
thing to do with the matter, we have more right to
do so, since much of our climate is Mediterranean.”
The cold savagery of the missionary work is relieved
by some fine verse by the editors and Hugh McCrae ;
and there is a bizarre little story (“The Adventure
of Art,” by Jean Andrade) which, for imaginative
quality and ease of expression, bears comparison with
“The Cask of Amontillado,” In “The Sex Synonym
in Art” Norman Lindsay uses Joyce’s “Ulysses” as
a peg on which to hang a raking attack on the cant
of Puritanism, and he also supplies a score of ex-
quisite little decorations.
“Tarago”: All bush newspaper-proprietors are not
as stingy on space rates as those mentioned by
“Caesar” (B. 26/4/’23) and “George Rich” (B.
29/3/’23). I was doing district correspondence for
a local rag at a fiver per annum when the boss pro-
posed that I should put in three days per week
writing up a neighboring settlement at a salary of
30s. and commission on new subs., ads. and jobbing,
the rates being 5, 10 and 15 per cent, respectively.
1 was agreeable, and what with new subs (eight to
10 per week), ads. and “jobs” I figured out that
the contract was turning me in from £2 to £2 ss.
for a column to a column and a half in 10-point
weekly. What’s wrong with that for space rates?
P.S. —I nearly forgot to mention that he never paid
me.
“Fleet Street”: Miss F. M. Stawell, daughter of
the second Chief Justice of Victoria, is perhaps the
most learned and literary of Australian ladies in
London, where she has resided for many years, little
known to the present generation of Melburnians. Her
books are highbrow and not likely to find many
readers in her native land outside the Universities.
Her latest erudite work, “The Making of the Western
Mind,” gets a couple of columns of unstinted praise
in the latest literary supplement of the Times.
Miss Stawell collaborated with J. F. Hogan in
bringing out the first London edition of the poems
of Grace Jennings Carmichael. “J.F.11.” wrote
the introductory appreciation in the library of the
House of Commons, and Miss Stawell did most of
the drudgery of proof-reading and correcting.
“J.F.H.”: Robert Louis Stevenson continues to be
the best seller in London auction rooms. Last month
one printed page of his verse written at his last
home in Samoa realised £l5O. It was a rollickv
little ditty, “I’ll sing you a tale of a tropical sea
on board the old Equator,” composed for a dinner
at the Tivoli Hotel, Apia, at which Stevenson presided
in 1891. He presented each of the guests with a
copy, but only ten of them had the sense or the
foresight to preserve theirs carefully. Bulletin
readers in Apia are recommended to search old
cupboards and dustbins. One or two forgotten copies
may possibly still be lurking there. A little play
of only eight leaves written by Stevenson in 1887
and printed for private circulation ran up to £2OB.
A letter from Stevenson to a young fellow who had
asked for advice as to the choice of a profession
realised £lO6. Incidentally, I myself am the proud
possessor of a four-page letter, one of the last written
by R.L.S., thanking me for asking some questions in
the Commons about Mataafa, the Samoan chief or
monarch whose cause Stevenson had vigorously cham-
pioned at Apia.
“Percival Pepperpot”: There is one newspaper in
an Australian capital that has no time for or patience
with crusading freelances. The prejudice arose
this way. The journal (a Sunday one) accepted a
series of “clean-up.-our-city” articles from one of
those enterprising persons who turn their experiences
of mean streets and dingy dosshouses into copy.
While he kept his fire on the “pinky joints,” sly
groggeries and vag.-infested parks and reserves, his
stuff was accepted and paid for without incident.
It was when he turned his attention to third-rate
coffee-palaces and hash-houses that he fired his own
mine. Indignantly he called, with the paper’s
voice, on the health authorities to do something to
bring the landlord of certain “ill-ventilated, bug-
infested dens” to their sense of responsibility. The
hotly-worded injunction caught the eye of a health
inspector. He began “doing something.” Satisfy-
ing himself that the complaint was well-founded, he
stirred up the City Council to action, which finally
took the form of a notice on the owner ordering him
to carry out repairs to the tune of £250. within 30
days. The scribe had omitted to ascertain that the
owner of the decaying tenement and the proprietor
of the newspaper where his articles were appearing
were one and the same person!
“Hamer”: When, dug out from hospital for a job
on the A.I.F. staff, I plunged into journalistic work
on the London papers, I experienced some shocks.
My first three pars, went to the Evening Standard,
and the very next day one of them appeared, set
across two columns, and liberally cross-headed. In
the succeeding issue another item saw print, and
next morning I received a cheque on large-sized paper
for a whole 2s. 5d., subsequently reinforced by an
additional Is. lid. But with the second cheque
came a letter from the conductor of the “Londoner’s
Diary” in the Standard, asking me to contribute to
that column, and my next two pars, under that head-
ing netted me over £l. Subsequently I found there
was some reason for these diverse payments. Lon-
don editors concede the man with a ness story a
right to syndicate it unless he bargains for special
rates. I might have got a couple of guineas for my
first item if I had offered it to the Standard exclu-
sively ; as I didn’t, I got the rate payable to a writer
who may be selling his news in a score of places.
Moreover, for stuff which I never saw' in type I would
occasionally receive cheques from papers published
in Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow or elsewhere.
Matter deemed unsuitable for London papers was sent
on by them to provincial journals in their “chain.”
These unexpected cheques, arriving as they did
when I was stone-broke (which was always), gave a
pleasant expectancy to press work in England which
is lacking in Australia.
THE VICTIM.

Where the stars of ages blink
O’er the sandy ways of time,
One with little hooks of ink
Hung his soul upon a rhyme.
Naked souls are strange to view
In the morning sharp with dew.
Smoothing words to make them shine
With the cheaper tricks of ink,
One, like washing on the line,
Hung the thoughts he did not think.
All the world was glad to find
Verse that measured up its mind.
Heavy look and glassy eye,
Half its vision cramped and curbed,
Solemnly the world goes by,
Hating to be much disturbed.
Let the man who would be king
Learn to do the easy thing.
Vague must be his thought, and veiled
In a language cold and dry.
Hence the passionate dream that failed
On a haunting human cry !
Words alone must be his pride
Lest our ease be crucified.
Where the stars of ages drink
From the crystal cups of time,
One with bitter nails of ink
Hung his heart upon a rhyme,,..
Seen from the reviewer’s desk,
lie was hardly picturesque.

Hoyt’s Moving Pictures
The biggest thing in Sydney’s week:—
Soft, twittering music floats from the organ-loft.
A figure swathed in white moves heavily into the
pulpit. A thousand beseeching eyes look upward.
Some are in faces lined with care and pain. Some
are those of the almost dead. A few burn with
the fire of new hope. Most reveal a patience and
resignation that may be beautiful or merely inevit-
able. As the music trails away to nothing, the star
slowly raises a hand. It is a large hand —broad and
thick, like the, man himself. The surplice accentuates
rather than conceals the corpulence of body, empha-
sises by contrast the florid face. It is a face as
barren of emotion as the door of the old cathedral
in which he stands—neither attractive nor repel-
lent, just flatly expressionless: the face of a stolidly
unimaginative man, probably humorless. The hand
comes swiftly, downwards, and with, a sharp “Dear
Brethren” —it sounds more like a command than a
salutation—James Hickson, the healer, introduced by
Australian Anglicans to act as the conduit of divind
mercy to the afflicted and to exalt the Church, begins
his season in Sydney.
The stage is well set. On the altar stands an
archbishop in crimson robes, flanked by priestly
'figures in other hues. Nurses, spotlessly white and
trim, line the chancel and the choir. Round the
jaltar steps, and close up to the missioner’s desk, are;
irecumbent forms rigid on stretchers. Others have
been wheeled in on chairs. Away to the farthest
seats are suppliants for spiritual anointment. Some
are paralysed: Some are blind. Locomotor ataxia,
arthritis, curvature of the spine—all the diseases to
which men and women are heirs had place in the
congested, unhappy throng mustered to see the age
of miracles swing back from the twilight of Time.
Hickson talks —on and on and on. One has a hor--
rible dread he may never stop. He talks loudly and
confidently, after the manner of an auctioneer. The
voice lacks even a suggestion of culture. The logic
betrays staggering crudity. “The physician or surgeon
may cure, but what he does represents mere science.
Believe! Pray! And prepare to receive from the
Church the grace which heals all and everything.”
To the stricken beings clustered there this may
have brought; consolatory anticipation of surcease to
come from invalidity or pain—to the blind, perhaps,
a great hope of looking out across the world again.
Heaven only' knows. To the children it can have
meant nothing. And they were there a-plenty, cud-
dling to a mother’s knees, whimpering and wonder-
ing, most of them in the clutch of circumstance the
most fell that waits on human kind. Poor little
sufferers with twisted limbs or defective spines, too
many of them bore the brand of society’s most terrible
sin against itself.
What seems an eternity passes. Hickson descends
from the high place to which he had climbed and
bustles round. The helpless are first disposed of.
The broad hands close over a bowed head, a dozen
words are mumbled, priestly fingers lightly follow,
and so on to the next and the next. After each con-
tact the sufferer is borne off by carriers, and so
swiftly away through the roaring city streets. The

BOURNE ROYAL.

less infirm are formed into a queue, and, filing past
the sanctuary and the healer, reach the open air.
Once there; anxious relatives come fluttering round,
peer into their faces, timidly test the shrunken arm
dr withered leg, look searchingly, mavbe, for signs
of revivified mentality—and, inside, Hickson, seeing
so many still pressing forward, calls gruffly to the
nurses, “Keep them moving—hurry them up.”
*
There was no charge for admission. Nor was there
a collection-plate. But at every door there was a
large box for receiving fixed deposits. Hickson works
at the rate of about 500 an hour. He reckons on
“doing” about 10,000 by the end of the week.
Cures? Let us hope. But —how many were plunged
into deeper depths of despair?
Pianist Moiseiwitscli was the musical
magnet in Sydney all last week, and his
matinee to-day (Thursday) shows every
sign of drawing still another crowded house
to the Town Hall. He is beyond all doubt

and the brilliant, and dashing Polonaise in
A flat were bracketed with the happiest re-
sults The Schumann. Carnival,.-a brilliant,
many-sided fancy, written for the composer’s
adored one (he married her afterwards),
was another work that kept the audience
spellbound; while the Debussy “Jardins sous
la Pluie” was a delightful refresher.
“The Cat and the Canary” continues its
machine-made thrills at Sydney Criterion;
and nightly, before the curtain winds up, the
theatre becomes a blackout to “give the
atmosphere.” This is the best part of the
show for the flapper—an escort who is any-
thing of a man will always clasp her hand
in reassurance during the shuddersome
period.
“Sally” had a souvenir night on Monday
at Sydney Majesty’s to commemorate her
150th performance. Josie Melville is still
radiating sparkle and vivacity ; to-night large
numbers" of rollicking undergraduates will
burn Commem. incense before her shrine.
The pensiveness of farewell still envelops
the seductive Maud Pane at Sydney Theatre
Royal. “Oh, Lady, Lady!” has two more
nights to go; “You’re in Love” will prolong
the final leave-taking for another five.

To-night (Thursday) Julius Knight finishes
a too-short season at Sydney Tivoli. These
last few days he has been doing the throne
scene from “The Sign of the Cross,” and
delighting the crowds that have come to see
it. By the way, the Tivoli orchestra, directed
by Will Quintrell, is entitled to a long-
delayed mention; the incidental music to
Julius Knight’s act was especially meritori-
ous. Terpsichore—graceful exponent of
classical dances —has returned _ with, among
others, an entrancing Hungarian dance to
Brahms’s beautiful music.
* * * *
Of Bunny’s show in Sydney:—
Rupert C. W. Bunny hangs a large exhibition at
Anthony Hordern’s Galleries. He is mainly a painter
of pretty draperies and females, has strong decora-
tive leanings, keeps a big range of colors on his
palette, and is a lover of light who, judged on this exhi-
bition, never quite succeeds in painting it. But he comes
near to it in “Waiting to be X-rayed,’’ “Hat-making’’
and “Early Breakfast.” Good drawing, remarkable dash
and pleasing color excite an interest, but it does not
always last, for his work generally fails in the matter
of conviction, being perhaps too realistic to be purely
decorative, and too consciously decorative and care-
less of essentials to be sound realism. The mixed
nature of his outlook sometimes leaves it difficult to
identify the object or effect he is representing. But
perhaps it is not necessary for a picture to be wholly
clear in this way. Let us hope not, for the sake
of nearly all modern art, of which Bunny is, in
Paris, at any rate, an acknowledged master.
Tenor Walter Kirby intends giving two
recitals in Sydney helve leaving for America
and England. The first is dated for the 21st.
At Sydney Crystal Palace Charles Don Q.
Chaplin, as a bona-fide member of the Build-
ers’ Laborers’ Union, might not help to re-
lieve the house shortage much, but his capers
are guaranteed to make one forget for a
while that the rent has just been raised.
Rodolph Valentino’s better-half makes her
debut at the Lyceum in “The Woman in
Chains.” The story has been told before in
09 ways—and the hundredth is no better.
“The Woman Conquers,” the sister film at
the same house, also dabbles in psychology,
but from another angle. Tom Meighan, one of
the few first-rate male silent-art mummers,
is seen to advantage in “Back Home and
Broke” at the Strand. The screen’s version
of the workings of the British Secret Service
makes an intriguing film at the Rialto and
Empress. The Sheik has superseded lounge-
lizards. and cave-men in the hearts of the
flappers: there is one of the dusky tribe in
a desert thriller at Hoyt’s.
Gerardy, hardly recognisable as the young
’cello wizard of former years, is delighting
audiences at Melbourne Town Bali with
the unaffected fervor of his performance.
The beautiful music he makes really gains in
effect by his ease in achievement. A master
on the ’cello is sorely tempted to make an
assumption of mastership, and the Gerardy
of old was, indeed, more of a showman than
the sad-looking artist of nowadays; but one
soon gets to like him all the better for leav-
ing it to his instrument to tell of the player’s
high purpose. He opened his Melbourne
season with Boellmann’s "Variations Sym-
phoniques,” followed by a Bocherini Sonata.
A concerto by Saint-Saens and a Handel
Pastorale were given at his second concert,
and on Saturday (when the printed pro-
grammes had strayed) Gerardy led off with
Haydn’s Concerto in D, was devotional in a
Jewish hymn melody, and drew upon Saint-
Saens and the popular Popper for other
items-in-chief. , To the number of his
encores on each occasion there was no end.
Everything he touches turns to gold of a
sort, though the sort is not always as 18-
c'arat as Schufhann’s “Abendlied” or Per-
golesi’s “Tre Giorni.” George Stewart
McManus is an excellent accompanist on the
piano, and Essie Ackland, the young Sydney
contralto, who contributes song to these con-
certs, is an interesting assistant. Miss
Ackland has a wide range of good notes, an
ingratiating appearance, a confident dramatic
sense, and a capital stage manner. When the
voice is more smoothed and cultivated (with-
out any loss of tone), the lady should always
find a welcome in Melbourne, where contralto
voices worth mentioning are now rarely
available. To-night (Thursday) Gerardy
plays the Elgar Concerto in E Minor.
* * * *
For one more week “The Arcadians” will
continue to court unfavorable comparisons
at Melbourne Majesty’s. Apart from the
affected exaggerations of Emmeline Orford
(who reduces the simple vulgarity of the
Mrs. Smith character to effusive play-acting),
the lack of feeling in Kathlyn Hilliard’s
Sombra, and the heavyweight nasalism of
Chisholm’s performance as an airy young
man who falls in love at first sight through a
pair of field-glasses, a serious fault with the
present revival is the mechanical utterance
of the chorus when called upon to talk. The
chorus’s remarks when the Arcadians burst
upon the scene of Askwood racecourse sug-
gest the awful unanimity of the responses
at church when the congregation is calling
itself uncomplimentary names.

“Bulldog Drummond,” at Melbourne
Palace, professes to be Booming Bigger than
Ever, but the Princess’s and the King’s are
flving Last Nights flags. That is to say,
“The O’Brien Girl” is having Last Glorious
Weeks, whilst “The Silver Fox,” at the
King’s, is definitely due to draw its last
breath on Friday, the 25th.
* * * *
“Smilin’ Through,” at Melbourne Royal,
confirms the worst suspicions of persons con-
versant with the prattle of spooks in the
stance business. The melodrama concludes
with the dialogue between Uncle John and
Moonyeen Clare, in their respective spirit
forms. From it one gathers that Moonyeen,
murdered on her wedding day, stays around
the premises of her bereaved bridegroom for
50 years, silently appealing to his better
nature, while awaiting the day when they will
retire together to the Great Beyond. What
she would have done if John had married
two or three times, and reared large families,
is not dimly indicated.
* * * *
Melbourne Majestic’s screen is flooded by
the sentimentality of “One Man in a Mil-
lion,” a dear old Italian whom George Beban
presents in a manner that would reduce a
bookmaker’s clerk to tears. The Majestic’s
other masterpiece, “Shadows,” also has a
few delicious moments for snifllers, but the
story concerns the mystery of a Chinese
laundryman who is a safe-deposit of family
secrets. At Hoyt’s De Luxe the main suit is
“The Flirt,” wherein Ma Rumor delivers
the usual sultry asides, and a damsel of
apparent virtue is found to be no better than
she ought to be. However, the best fiction
is “Back Home and Broke,” at Hoyt’s over-
flow house, the Melbourne Gaiety. This jest,
affording fresh views of Thomas Meighan s
comedy, is alleged to have been special!,
written for him by George Ade.
Two Girls do a turn in Melbourne:
There is very little difference in performance
between Elma Roach and Madge Freeman, the young
water-colorists who are making their debut at t e
Fine Art Society’s Gallery. Miss Roach has a fair
command of her medium, but she ought not to devote
her attention to interiors of the type of “The Ole.
Milking Shed,” which are inclined to expose the
present state of her talent, nor should she meddle in
moonlight effects, like the Malmsbury Nocturne (No.
22), until she has had more practice. She is better
in the presentation of gum-trees, with big, gie.'
trunks, and in “Cloud Shadows” (No. 16) she has
achieved a delicate, decorative beauty unapproaehed
by any of Miss Freeman’s pictures. On the whole,
however, Miss Freeman has a smaller proportion of
failures. She signs a very pleasing impression of a
quarry-hole (No. 66), which is without any raw
notes, and her “Breezy Day” and “The Back Gate,
the latter opening on to a well-painted back yard,
are commendable for their color and grace.

Another Melbourne show :
W. Frater, who is again exhibiting at the
Athenaeum, is about the most consistent of the real-
ists who have been affected by the doctrines of
Meldrum. Frater makes no concession to popular
taste. He paints landscape with a sombre passion
for grey and simple themes. His canvases are mostly
low-toned, with never a peep of sunlight, or with
a sunlight so subdued that it seems a faltering
glimmer over a dim, parched world. Those educated
in the academic conventions of Art will see in some
of these a Nature perishing steadily of drought or
neglect; nevertheless each show’s sounder observation
than 90 per cent, of the work that is hung in Mel-
bourne from week to week. Frater knows what he
is about. Examples may be selected wherein the
achievement is below his average good form- one
may take “The Meadow” (No. 52) as a bit under-
pitched and formal in style—but for every one of
those comparative failures there are half-a-dozen of
the quality of “A Harmony in Grey” (No. 71) and
“Autumn Afternoon” (No. 20). His portraiture is
also good. The study of an unnamed and un-
numbered young man with bright eyes and a reso-
lute countenance has a piercing directness about it.
His self-portrait, revealing a head half-buried in
shadow, suggests a modest concealment of his per-
sonality, whereas the picture of Nell, caught in a
strong light, is a frank assertion of feminine vivacity.
The lady in “The Black Hat” looks more distant,
but she isn’t suffering from anaemia.
“ SMILIN' THROUGH." AT MEL-
BOURNE ROYAL.
Lady Forbes Robertson as Kathleen Dun-
yannon blarneys Uncle John Carteret
(William Mollison).
Adelaide pictures are nicely varied. At
West’s the tremendous “Pour Horsemen”
displays the horrors of war; the York has
“The Old Homestead,” mostly sob-stuff, with
the “Oriental” drama which American imag -
nation has woven around Omar. Mary Pick-
ford has been at this house, too, with her
new version of “Tess.” At the Pav. for
Cup Week is the steeplechasing “Hottentot”
picture, funny and exciting. The Grand is
using the Town Hall as an overflow house
on Saturdays, “Monte Cristo” being a huge
success. The Royal has finished a record
run of “Cairo.” Music, spectacle and plot
all appeal more on the second visit. Kitty
Reidy makes a charming heroine, and the
effeminate sultan is faithful work; but to
Oscar Asche and Gladys Mason are most
of the honors. Notable at the Majestic are
the singing of the Molinaris and Jim Gerald
in a “Dame” part; and at the Prince of
Wales Eddie and Decima Maclean still sow
the whirlwind.

It is in the morning when moments are precious and when the
ordinary safety razor may let you down with its dull unstropped
blade that you appreciate the advantages of the always sharp
self-stropping “Valet Safety Razor. 78 seconds from lather to

its speed.
There is no fiddling with screws or clips to replace a blade that is too dull

“0.K.” with his wreath:—
The one thing the matter with the late Charles
Workman was his tendency to snigger at himself.
Though not quite as bad as the snigger Phil Smith
suffered from when he came to Australia, and which
he subsequently brought under subjection, it was
a rather trying profession of faith in his own funni-
ness. His self-conscious frivolity was the very
antithesis of the smileless humor of, say, William
Collier, the American comedian who brought “The
Dictator” to these shores. He “overdid” his comedy
in most cases. In “So Long, Letty,” or “Canary
Cottage,” or whatever the piece was named wherein
Connie Ediss was a better cook than Dot Brunton,
the love of Workman for his neighbor’s wife’s cookery
was over-accentuated. He smacked .his lips too
much, rolled his eyes too much, and showed in a
score of ways that the comedy sense was not born
in him. He had started his stage career with a
gocjd, tuneful voice and a nimble, pair of legs, but
as |a comedian he was machine-made. His Bumerli
in “Chocolate Soldier” was a finished piece of work,
but the man was always acting. So with his Ali
THE POOR PLAYER.
STREET SINGER: “ Only a brown! Gor blimey, mister,
that doesn't pay the amusement tax."
Baba in “Chu Chin Chow.” Nobody else in Aus-
tralia at the moment could have been quite so efficient
in the part, but, then, it was only a pantomime
part. In Gilbert and Sullivan Workman showed but
little of the restraint which marked the original
characterisations under Gilbert’s disciplinary manage-
ment. His more effusive style belonged to a
later period when Gilbert didn’t worry.
“T. 0.1.”: The vaudeville world has lost
John Fuller, father of Ben. Tohn, Walter,
Ray and three married daughters, and a ser-
viceable tenor in his time. Bred to the nrint-
ing trade, John quitted comping at 28 and
earned a precarious living by singing in
British pubs and other haunts of the elect:
he has left it on record that he sang three
songs for half-a-cmwn at one cave of har-
monv; at another he received 3d. a turn.
In 1889 he came to Australia with the Lon-
don Pavilion Co. It crashed, owing John
salary, but he carried on in the mus.c-halls
of the period until 1893, when he went to
Maoriland with the Albani sisters, setting
in Auckland. There the frugal vocalist put
his savings into waxworks and vaudeville,
and, the M.L. public being keen on both, _h.s
fortune was made. John was 15 at the finish.
“O.Iv.”: I forget how many years have
gone over to the majority since last I heard
old John Fuller sing “Sally in Our Alley,
but, whenever it was, I remember that John s
tuneful light tenor-falsetto sounded just as
sweet and true as it had sounded many years
before. He was playing an engagement with
Rickards, I think, when his voice’s excellent
state of preservation was remarked in Mel-
bourne by all .the veterans who had heard
him warble the same songs in the then long
ago. John must have been an artist in
voice-production, or he never could have kept
liis “Sally” so long before the public. All
the old-timers were on his side in an action
he once brought against a pretentious M.L.
publication which had called him a rotten
singer with a cracked tenor voice.
“Santander” : Fred Cambourne’s economy
(B. 10/5/’23), regarded as meanness by
many a brother mummer w.o failed to
borrow money from him, was justified by
his determination to have always a Ltt e
cash to tide him over the bleak patches oi
a precarious profession. Cambourne had no
illusions about himself. He tucked away
every penny he could spare so that he wouldn't
have to cadge h s keep or leave landladies
lamenting, like some of his tribe. A false
air of Bohemian casualness clings to the
actor-r who never pays anybody, _ but it is
pleasant to hear of one who, despite all the
unpopularity that his carefulness evolt d,
lived and died free of debt. Fred, by the
way, worked in a Flinders-lane warehouse
before he joined Nell e Farren and Cf. He
is said to have been an Englishman, but
one who knew him well assures me that he
was born in Australia.
“G.A.C.”: If Harry Lauder hadn’t been
unlucky enough to make a name as a singer
of ballads he would have made a peach of a
pressman. He realises how sick the publ c
is of the usual interview, so, when
I went to him the other day with a
view to getting him to talk nonsense, he
straightway entered into the spirit of it, and
helped me play the fool in pr nt. He had
some stunning ideas, too. After all, it isn’t
just genius that makes a man famous; it is
genius and push together. Lauder looks
after his work, not merely on the stage, but
on the publicity side, too. Later" by the
way, he lunched a number of Brisbane press-
men, and gave them good solid talk about the
League of Nations.
“Wilfrido”: Reginald Berkeley, the young
author of “Eight O’clock” and “French
Leave,” is not a Maorilander, despite
peated assertions to this effect. I am not
sure whether he was born in England or
in Fiji; but he has spent most of his life in
the latter place. His uncle, Sir
Henry Berkeley, was Chief Jus-
tice there, and his father, Hum-
phrey Berkeley, a typical pro-
duct of the Old Smoke, was a
prominent figure at the Fiji
Bar. Reginald himself quali-
fied, and built up a practice
there, to which he has not re-
turned since the war. His one-
act “Eight O’Clock,” deal-
ing with the Hardyesque
subject of a man waiting his
end by the noose, is based on
an actual experience. He ap-
peared for a Fijian murd rer
who was condemned, and he was
present with the man prior to
the execution. The same theme
was employed by Thomas Wood
Stevens and Kenneth Sawyer
Goodman, two Americans, who
wrote a one-act called “Ryland.”
and had it produced by the
Stage Guild in Chicago some
years ago. Berkeley’s latest
publication is a series of cari-
catures and burlesques written
in collaboration with Bohun
Lynch. Amongst those who re-
ceive a rough handling are Jus-
tice Darling, Shaw, Chesterton,
Barrie, Lloyd George, Robey
and Dr. Marie Stopes.
“Nella”: This is not Julius Knight’s first
appearance as the star turn at Sydney Tivoli.
When the Hun was strafing. Julius put in a
week at the Tiv., his turn being the reciting
of Lytton’s “The Portrait.” The salary went
to a war fund.
“0.K.”: Apropos a recent remark that
Shakspeare played only such “poor” parts
as the Ghost in “Hamlet” and Adam in
“As You Like It,” it isn’t always the b:g
part that is the good part. No man with a
good voice and gait was ever a failure as
the Ghost. The part scores the maximum
of melodramatic effect with the minimum
of histrionic ability. Much the same may-
be said of Adam: it makes small demands on
the technique of the player, but is full of fat.
I remember, when Oscar Asche produced “As
You Like. It,” complimenting Grimwood on
his conspicuous success as “the goed oM
man.” “But did any actor ever fail as
Adam?” he asked.
From Tien Hogue:—
At the Chatham Empire, one of the Stoll houses,
i saw a unique act. Veterans of Variety, in which
o i d s t ars 0 f t h e ’alls reappear in the ditties that
d az zled Dad and Mum. There was Arthur Roberts,
singing “I’m Living with Mother Now” (he first sang
it in 1882), Leo Dryden in “The Miner’s Dream of
Home,” Charles Bignell in “What Ho! She Bumps.”
Tom Costdlo in “At Trinity Church I Met Mv
Doom,” Sable Fern in “What’s the Use of Loving a
IN THE WINGS.
“And how is your husband, Mrs. Gadder ?”
“Do you know, I said his photo in a paper the other day, and I
thought he had grown fatter .”
Girl ?” and Marguerite Corneille in “Hello, My
Baby.” Another was Jake Friedman, who gave
snatches from opera, and who, I am told, used to
do a yodelling turn for Harry Rickards at Melbourne
Opera House 30 years ago. Some of the aged per-
formers were quite wonderful, particularly Costello
and Charles Lee, who danced as if he were a boy
of 20 instead of an ancient who can remember See-
ing Raglan leave London on his way to command the
British Army in the Crimea —and Raglan,was Wel-
lington’s aide-de-camp at Waterloo, wasn’t he?
The finale was “Comrades,” sung with real feeling
by‘the dear old boys and girjs. They are revisit-
ing the gl'mpses of the footlights at Albert de Cour-
ville’s instance, and the effect is wholly charming.
“Norbell” : The moving-picture business is
much older than is generally supposed. In
“Taming of the Shrew,” for instance, the
servant who is trying to propitiate Chris-
topher Sly asks: —
Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,
And Cytherea all in sedgqs hid,
Which seem to move....
And going back even further than Shaks-
peare’s day, to the activities of the original
Moses and Aaron, the Bible says:—
Then ye shall drive out>all the inhabitants of the
land before you, and destroy all their pictures.
Obviously an attempt by the German Jews
of the period to collar the trade.
“Astor” : In the ineptly-named “Whirlpool,”
produced at Melbourne Playhouse, there is
an extremely frank allusion to certain articles
of feminine underwear —more frank than
anything I have heard in the commercial
theatres. Yet highbrow audiences, which
would regard a subtler reference to undies
as fundamentally vulgar and naughty in a
musical comedy,, registered a unanimous
giggle when one of Mary Wilkinson’s charac-
ters brought forth the jest. I may say that
I was tickled with its candor, and contributed
a small guffaw to the general merriment,
but, manlike, I am susceptible to this form
of humor. The towering intellects around me
were obviously too gently nurtured to toler-
ate vaudeville pleasantr.es elsewhere, and I
am wondering how they justified their laugh
to their inconvenient consciences.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : Irene Browne, who was
chosen by J. A. E. Malone (Malone and
Grossmith) to play the part of Sophie Full-
garney in the revival of “The Gay Lord
Quex, has won unstinted praise from the
crlt cs. G. H. Mair, of the Evening
Standard, says that the producers “c n-
sidered half the actresses of London
for the part,” and “were fortunate in having
patience enough to wait till they came to
Miss Browne, who plays it with just the
right confidence and charm. I re “e e

going without smokes, etc., another • •
myself raised the enormous fee reci ‘
get into the gai-
lery. We left col-
lege at 4 a.m. in
quest of tickets. At
9 the dcors were
opened, but the
gallery was sold
out before our turn
came. Next morn-
ing we set out at
3 a.m., determined
to be in time.
Again there were
too many ahead of
us. However, about
9.15 a.m. we man-
aged to buy a
couple of tickets
from a friend who
had suddenly found
himself unable to
use his. We then
dashed olf to the
queue at the
theatre, and there
we stood until 5.30
p.m., at which hour
we were let in. At
7 p.m. the Great
Singer, looking per-
fee 11 y fit, came
along to say she
was so sorry, but
she was too tired
to sing that night.
She was sure we
would be charmed
by the other mem-
bers of the com-
pany, who were
really much better
than herself. I
never went to hear
her on her subse-
quent visits, and I
can never read of
her triumphs nowadays without disgustedly
recalling the airy way in which she trampled
on the feelings and rights of people w r ho had
paid heavily in pocket and comfort for the
privilege of hearing her sing.
“G.A.C.”: Brisbane is a queer mass of
contradictions. You’d swear one minute it
was the last stronghold of barbarism; then
it does things like it did the other evening
when it rolled up to the Austral Choir, which,
under conductor Jordan, got well away from
tradition, and threw Holst’s “Hymn of
Jesus” and Arthur Bliss’s “Rout”—both
given for the first time in Australia —at the
audience. Holst and Bliss are both living
English composers, and their music is as
modern as the poetry of Ezra Pound and
Edith Sitwell. But the Holst item was a
fine piece of work. It had real dramatic and
riiusical significance, and left you with a
devout feeling which isn’t often, there after
one of the o’d oratorios. The. Bliss item was
more interesting than attractive —a scrap of
futurist music. But it may help us to
understand the “Color” Smnnhonv when we
hear it,: Then there were madrigals by Byrd,
a bit of Purcell, some Percy Grainger and
songs by Far jeon—a programme that
wouldn’t look old-fashioned in any concert
hall in the world.
“T.R.H.”: Plays adapted from Dickens’s
novels have been sporadically successful (B
26/4/’23), but as a general rule there is no
money in them. Twenty years ago I saw
“Poor Jo,” a dramatisation of “Bleak
House,” at the Middlesex Theatre in Drury-
lane. The house was within a stone’s-throw
of Mr. Tulkinghorn’s home in Lincoln’s Inn
and of the cemetery where Lady Dedlock’s
lover was buried; and in the surrounding
district there were thousands of blokes like
Jo. But the play was taken off after an
unprofitable week’s run, and replaced by
highly-flavored vaudeville, always popular in
a place where babies are weaned on un-
sweetened gin. Even Cartwright and Miss
Horniman could not make Dickens pay ex-
penses at the Manchester Repertoire Theatre.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Allan Wilkie struck
such a cold time at Goulburn (N.S.W.) that
he was moved to make some bitter reflections
on the artistic deadness of some country
towns. Goulburn suffers from the delusion
that only top-notch city shows are good
enough for it—a top-notch show being any
hotch-potch that the Firm may st-nd along.
It has long been included by minor touring
companies in the list of “Actors’ Graves.”
Had Wilkie appeared in Goulburn under the
Williamson-Tait management he would have
had packed houses. Goulburn is that sort
of town.
AD ASTRA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dramatic artists wanted at once, all lines. No
previous experience necessary.”-—S. M. Herald ad.
There was a fairly well-filled house —
They’d struck the big pay at the mine—
But soon the gods began to rouse,
And once they counted up to “nine.”
It scared the mummers when they heard
The clamor of the baleful bird.
The co. still struggled bravely on,
And gramophoned the turgid stuff,
Until, when half Act 2 was gone,
The miners had endured enough,
And loudly bellowed from the back,
“Ring off, Camille, you’re voted black 1”
And then the storm broke in the hall,
And Busker’ knew his name was mud
When frail Camille began to squall,
And Armand stopped a mouldy spud.
A p’liccman let the curtain clown,
The co. at midnight left for town.
For fame Camil'e no longer craves,
Her “Saign, please! ” earns a decent wage;
Each customer that Armand shaves
Is tcld, “When I was on the stage”
They'll-never act again, they vow,
Because they’ve gained experience now.

CHEVROLET
—first motor-car to travel from
PERTH to BRISBANE and back.
It has remained for a five-passenger, stock model Chevrolet Car to
make the first overland tour from Perth to Brisbane and back. Mr. J. K.
Warner, of Subiaco, W.A., thus tells the story of how Chevrolet carried
him through.
“Being desirous of taking a holiday, I decided to purchase a CHEVROLET
and see my native land—Australia. 1 have travelled from Perth, through
Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane and back, including side trips to
Toora (Victoria), Blue Mountains and up the summit of Mt. Kosciusko (N.S.W.).
“During the entire trip—the first to cover the five mainland States of
Australia —the Chevrolet has not given me a moment’s trouble. The engine is
running perfectly, and the ‘Boomerang’ Tyres are in excellent condition. Not once
have I been stuck even on the worst roads. Up to the time of writing I have
covered over 7000 miles and have used only 54 tins of benzine, an average of
32.2 miles per gallon, for the trip.
“The Chevrolet has carried four passengers with luggage and up to eight tins
of fuel, and I cannot conceive of any car in the world putting up a better
performance.
“I am convinced that the Chevrolet is without equal for Australian road
conditions, and can recommend it to anyone who desires an economical car.

M.C.: But if the intellectuals of Berlin
are starving, France’s occupation of the Ruhr isn’t
responsible for it. That responsibility lies with the
German industrial and financial magnates —Stinnes is
only one of them —who, without the least doubt in
the world, have become enormously wealthy since the
war by divers tricks, including the smashing of the
mark —a process undertaken by them originally in
order to escape their debts. .. .913: Thanks, let it
go at that; but let’s put it on record that it was
big Mick O’Brien, then corporal, who stepped forward
to actually cut the cords of the white soldier who
was “crucified’’ while a mob of Gyppos looked 0n....
E.C.P.: You gallop in one line and canter in the
next. It is disconcerting. .. .Atir: If you got it back
it was probably mentioned... .W.0.T.: Poor stuff. .. .
J.A.T.: You don’t make much of it. . . .R.J.C.: No
use to us. . . .Eleanor M.: Horrible. .. .Kappa: Doesn’t
get near... .E.M. (Rochester): Very slight and a bit
lumpy.... A.H.P.: Read good verse and then make
up your mind what it is you really want to say....
N.C. (North Sydney): Both fail... .W.0’11.: Another
man’s good meat turned into hash... .R.H.
(Northern) : Hardly enough in the idea to carry
the rather poor handling. .. .W.11.C.: As thin as
the shadow of a dream.... A.C.W.: Weak album
verse... .T.H.R.: Germany’s “mailed hand” coming
from the “vitals of her cruel heart” is a novelty,
any way.... T.T.: Yes, yes, we remember all those
things. We also remember thousands of bad verses
which said just the same.... Praetor: Verses tagged
out with the obvious and the trivial for the sake iff
the rhymes.... May M.: Weary old idea that has
seen much tearful service... .R.R. (Sandgate) : Not
for us F.C.8.: The giggling young female must
take her mirthless cackle to another market....
W.E.8.: Don’t believe the yarn.... Paul R.: Not up.
....N.C. (Enfield): Nothing there. .. .M.8.R.: It
tails off. . . .Hayseed: Too little quality. . . .C.L.C.:
The “Host” has points, but drops back among the
undistinguished also-rans.... Pinchgut: As thin as ;
war-time beer... .H.H.11.: First of all, be natural.
Nobody ever talked like that and was listened to.
....Thomas B.: Spoiled by carelessness. One minute
your star talks like an archbishop and the next like
a bottle-o. . . .Bellcrive: The pathos of it moved the
office to beers: —-
Ten years ago we parted
One dreary autumn day;
In the fiery heat of passion,
I drove my boy away ;
To clear his reputation
He sadly did implore,
As I branded him as evil.
And drove him from the door.
His parting words were, “Father,
I’ll sail the bounding- main;
My cousin will replace me,
We’ll never meet again.”
I’m growing old and feeble.
My life is nearly done;
My nephew was the guilty,
I’d wronged my wretched son.
. ..H.E.R.: “The Massacre” doesn’t make its gory
nature sufficiently evident... .J.D.S.: • Lamentable.
Gordon B.: We note your opinion—expressed in
shocking metre —that knowledge is rarer than cash.
We sometimes doubt it... . Corkscrew: Too obscure.
....Sulcus: Would need far brighter telling.,...
G.N.C.: Dreary stuff drawn out to an impossible
length... .S.C.K.: That new word “replenquishing”
is more interesting than the Chinaman. .. . L.S.
(Glebe Point): Crude picture-show stuff. ...W.M.8.:
All too slight. Also you cannot get far while your
ear will let you rhyme “love” with “enough.” And
hour is one syllable. .. .E.V.T.: Doesn't strike us. .. .
M.J.D.: They repeat, old ideas with many false
rhymes A.E.P.: Choked with commonplaces uni
words that don’t say what you want them t 0...,.
Sucre: Verse too rugged to carry “The Man from
Sussex Street”.. ..C.C.S.: Too many of your lines
won’t scan. Remember the words of Solomon:
“Ponder the path of thy feet” King Olaf: You
hav e an unusual sense of humor: —
He was walking with one foot on each side of the
street,
And he only measured a mile round the waist.
And his toenails they growed out on the back of
his neck,
They were buttoned on with St. Patrick’s paste.
He was trying to sleep in his bed one night,
When a she bed-bug swiped his glass-eye;
You should have seen him run after that bug with
a knife —
You’d have laughed until you would have died.
Then he tried to act Dr. Tanner to fast forty days,
But he only fasted a while,
For his stomach it caved in like a roof made of tin,
And he stretched himself out half-a-mile..
Then we stuffed him up with shavings and hay,
And the gentle wind from south it entered into
his moutln •
And he blew all away.
....Fred A.: Bad C.M. (Lismore): You haven’t
made “Heart” very interesting 8.A.C.: Don’t
write in a jargon of that sort. . . .Jan It.: Gush with-
out rhyme, rhythm or purpose G.K. (Toorak) :
Nothing fresh about it D.F.F.: Not enough inter-
est. .. . W.E.L.: “Sorrow” goes lame. .. .Cres.sida:
Write about something real Queenslander: Learn
your subject; and then improve your verse
Michael O.: Doesn’t make a yarn....M.L.C.: No,
hardly even a J.P .R.F.T.: Not strong enough to
do even one lap. . . .Eric J.: Crude. . . .E.P.
(Corowa) : None of them any good Sanger: Says
old things in the old way J.H.A.: Can’t find
the mirth P.H. (Geelong) : Rumbles along noisily
without heed of scansion, besides occasionally mis-
laying the sense.

of sins Q 4: Call again when you’ve grown up. ...

saw one of your drawings... .M.S.: A wooden idea
woodenly executed... .W.S.W.: Drawing shows pro-

“Peter Wongi”: I nominate myself for
the longest continuous train journey in Aus-
tralia. Eighteen months ago I went from
Longreaeh (Q.) to xMeekatharra (W.A.) as
quickly as trains could get me there. • I
don’t know the mileage, but it beats “Yin-
cimus” (B. 19/4/’23) by 600 miles and
“Pantagruel’s” lady (B. 8/3/’23) by 826
miles. I don’t think there is a longer trip
possible in Australia.

“Te Pana”: Maoriland should soon be
supplying itself with home-made handles for
axes, picks, shovels and hammers, to say
nothing of clothes-pegs. Some fine samples
of the goods made from Southland beech are
being sent to the British Empire Exhibition.
The price is right, and there is enough beech
in the South to keep the industry going
until the Dominion debt is wiped out.
"Ding Bhat”: The P.M.G.’s Department
struck a snag, or a series of them, in Wind-
sor (N.S.W.) lately. They were digging a
trench for a conduit in George-street, and
about IS inches down had to chop their way
through an old corduroy roadway of iron-
bark logs about 12 inches thick. The timber
—hundreds of yards of it—was apparently
as sound as when nut down. As corduroy
is invariably the primary road medium, and
Windsor was streeted by Macquarie, the
logs must be somewhere about a century old.
"Tarago” : What the Yallorn electric scheme
will mean to Victoria may be gauged by the
fact that the Railway Commissioners are
already asking Parliamentary sanction to
electrify the main Gippsland line to Bairns-
dale (174 miles). Twenty years ago this
line was one of the heaviest losers in the
State, but traffic has so increased that plans
for duplication were submitted and prelim-
inary surveys made. With electrification
duplication won’t be necessary, for the run-
ning time of trains is practically halved. The
Melbourne-Geelong section was also marked
for duplication, but it is now proposed to
electrify the single track as a cheaper alter-
native.
* * * *
“Good Australian” : Melbourne is indulg-
ing in a miniature land-boom, a mere boy’s
size, certainly, by comparison with the one
which wiped out 10 “banks” and 40 build-
ing societies during the 10 years ending 1893.
At Ormund, a residential suburb just beyond
the Caulfield racecourse, 88 allotments were
sold for £13,149 one Saturday lately, fetch-
ing up to £4 2s. 6d. a foot. The same day
at Bentleigh, two stations further on, V 6(
lots realised £21,400—-from £2 10s. to £25.
At Box Hill, nine miles from Melbourne, £4O,
£36 and £26 were paid. Vic. Treasurer
McPherson has been borrowing gloriously for
the past five years, and a parallel of the over-
borrowing period of the Gillies-Deakin Min-
istry in ISB6 has been created.
“Heredot”: A new field of commercial
effort was recently exploited in Sydney by
the employee of a firm whose speciality is
the making of discs, dies and metal stamps.
From an ordinary, everyday drabness, the
youth suddenly blossomed out into a sar-
torial effulgence that made him the envy of
his fellows. Pressed to account for his sud-
den opulence, he spoke vaguely of a run of
luck at the races. But one morning he
failed to turn up to work, and later on in
the day a couple of plainclothes men
called to make inquiries. Then it came
out that the young man had discovered a
brisk demand, at handsome prices, for double-
headed pennies to be used in two-up schools,
and had set himself to supplying it, in his
spare time, on the firm’s dies.
“Harold Hardupp” : The snapper-up of un-
attended motors becomes more frequent and
impudent every day in the Harbor City.
Quite recently a car disappeared from before
a block of flats in Darlinghurst. The owner,
who arrived just in time to see it rounding
the corner, commandeered another car, and
started in pursuit of his property. The first
robbers went into a hotel to have a drink,
and during their absence a second set of
thieves got away with the horseless shay.
It was found, hours later, at Coogee, the
joyriders in possession having picked it up,
apparently deserted, in Kensington. Then
the owner had some difficulty in explaining
what lie was doing with the conveyance in
which he had maintained his stern chase. As
he had converted it to his own use without
permission, the loss of this, too, had been
naturally reported to the police.
“Frozen Mit”: Meares, manager of Aus-
tralia’s biggest co-operative concern, is back
from preaching “Preference for Dominion
Goods” in Britain. And now he has another
mission—to convince exporters that our
canned foodstuffs must be made more attrac-
tive-looking and be standardised, 80 per cent,
of foodstuffs being bought on appearance. A
British merchant sadly pointed out the other
day the difference between the get-up of
canned meat from America and that from
the Dominions; and the complaint is almost
universal. General Ryrie, president of the
local branch of the Empire Development
Union, said the other day that “the voice
of Australia must be loud and insistent in
requesting preferential treatment for Aus-
tralian products in Great Britain.” It would
be more to the purpose if the loud and in-
sistent voice stopped in Australia and roared
condemnation at us for our casual packing
methods.
* * * *
“Zimra” gives Macquarie-street a tip:—
The quack and the herbalist understand the value
of “suggestion” far better than the average sawbones.
The charlatan’s ad., “I Cure Fits,” is exquisitely
simple and direct; and the epileptic who writes and
encloses a fee for treatment believes that the nostrum
will fix him up. When, therefore, a preparation of
bromide and arsenic comes along, accompanied by a
brochure describing how the chief constituent of this
marvellous cure is the active principle of a rare drug
known only to the advertising philanthropist, the
patient swallows the pills, firmly convinced that he
will rapidly improve. So, for a time, he does, and
sends his blessing and more money to his benefactor.
The herbalist invariably prefaces his remarks with
“I cure you,” perhaps adding that the herbs for two
months’ treatment will cost £2O. But what do fees
matter to the patient who knows he will be cured ?
On the other hand, apart from the “cheery bedside
manner” and the highly ethical “bread pill” sancti-
fied by the British Pharmacopoeia, the medico does
not practise optimistic suggestion. He does a
lot of pessimistic suggestion, however. His face is
grave as he examines, pained when writing the ’scrip,
and lugubrious as, in a. tired fashion, he hands it
over with: “If this doesn’t do you any good, drop
in next week.” And if it doesn’t do any good, the
sick man drops in—to the adjacent quack. Where-
upon the doctor calls everyone to witness what a
fool the sick man is. But the sick man is not the
greater fool.


When the spark
says GO///
Then TEXACO, the volatile* Motor Spirit,
responds—instantly. It puts the GO into your
motor for a quick get-away or the full-power
steady pull.
In less than 100th part of a second every particle of
motor spirit should completely give up its power. Texaco
Motor Spirit does this to the last molecule. It gives up
its power and gives it quickly.
If you buy motor spirit by habit, then try a new method
for better all-round results. Ask specifically for Texaco,
the volatile Motor Spirit, and watch the difference in
your motor. All garages can supply.

“Tarago”: What battalion sustained the
heaviest casualties during the war? Well,
none of those already cited, but the 22nd
(6th Brigade), with 5406. And for the
heaviest proportional losses in the shortest
time, my nomination is the 24th Battalion,
in the argument at Bulleeourt in 1917. Leav-
ing the. tapes at 3.45 on the morning of
May 3 623 strong, they were relieved at mid-
night, and returned to the railway embank-
ment, just behind their starting-point, with
87 men all told.
“Dee”: Bligh and his party (B. 26/4/’23)
didn’t land anywhere on the east coast of
Australia. They landed on Timor. Here is
the extract from Bligh’s own narrative: —
On Friday, June 12, at 3 in the morning, with an
excess of joy, we discovered Timor....lt appeared
scarcely credible to ourselves that in an open boat
and so poorly provided we should have been able to
reach the coast of Timor in 41 days after leaving
Tolfoa, having in that time run by the log a dis-
tance of 3678 miles; and that, notwithstanding our
extreme distress, no one should have perished on
the voyage.
“The Deacon”: Another all-wool chaplain
(B. 3/5/’23) was ancient padre Clune, of
the N.S.W. Passionist Fathers. Clune was
loved and cussed by officers and men all over
the fighting-line. His venerable whiskers
were usually where trouble was thickest, and
repeated threats to return him to the other
“Dugout Kings” at the back of the line never
seemed to have been ccfried out. His brother,
the R.C. Archbish. of Perth (W.A.), is an
ex-Redemptorist thunderer, who also went to
the war, but he did no front-line stunts, being
among the clerical brass-hats.
A hardy Norseman was John Olsen, who
passed out at Dunedin (M.ju), the other
day at 76. Forty years ago he sailed to the
Ricketty Isles, and after roughing it in the
coastal trade joined the Telegraph Depart-
ment. He saw through the erection of most
of the line over the Rimutakas. Even at 65
Olsen wasn’t afraid to risk his neck, and
when others jibbed at shifting the flagstaff
over the Seamen’s Mission in Dunedin he
went along and casually did the job. Peter
Munro, the field-games giant, who was in
Australia with the M.L. team last year, is a
son-in-law.
“Splinter”: There has been some confusion
over the date of the discovery of the Tweed
River (N.S.W.), the centenary of which is
to be celebrated in November. It was called
the Tweed by Lieut. Oxley when he dis-
covered it in 1823, but Capt. Rous, of
H.M.S. Rainbow, happened on it five years
later and he called it the Clarence. It would
be a‘strange naval boat that would cross in
over the bar these days. Parochial Govern-
ments have done their best to keep the rich
area in a semi-pioneering stage by their con-
sistent evasion of the demands for an outlet
via a Murwillumbah-Tweed Heads railway
to the natural market, which is Brisbane.
Lee Kwang Heng, Consul for China in
Maoriland, is pleading for the removal of the
£lOO poll-tax on Chinese entering the Windy
Isles on the ground that “the restriction is
affecting commercial relations between the
two countries.” China no more likes half-castes
than Australia does : and, besides, it is far too
keen a buyer to refuse to take our goods if
it wants them and we can sell them of good
quality, well packed, cheaper than others.
But even if it won’t take them we will have
to put up with it; the sacrifice of a few
sales to China can be better faced than the
mongrelisation of the white race.
“Kip”: From the vital statistics of
Hawaii for 1922 it looks as if it won’t be
long before the Japs become the dominant
race in that part of the Pacific. Out of a
total of 11,067 births, 5526 were the children
of Japanese parents, while only 405 Ameri-
can children were born during the year. To
the Yank these figures have a special signi-
ficance ; for every one of these youngsters,
by reason of the fact that Hawaii is Ameri-
can territory, is entitled to the privileges of
a citizen of the United States; and as an
American citizen he can enter the mainland,
take up territory, and cast his vote. It looks
as if the TJ.S. naturalisation and' land laws,
which were never intended to admit un-
assimilable aliens, need tightening up. i
“Schnorrer”: Trouble, very significant in
its way, has been started in Melbourne
Jewry by a wealthy member objecting to the
trouble taken over Hebrew education, and
declaring for assimilation. At one time the
doctrine of assimilation was almost fashion-
able, but that was when there was no bright-
ness in the outlook for the Jews, and their
absorption into the nations amongst which
they, lived appeared inevitable. Since the
Zionist movement started the pride of Jewry
m being “a peculiar people” has revived.
Every Jewish boy prior to becoming
confirmed must know a certain amount
of Hebrew, and the complaint is that
the boys do not usually get enough in-
struction in it to make them really inter-
ested in their religion. For a prominent Jew
to say that it is a mistake to bother about
it is something like an Irish politician de-
claring that Ireland never had any troubles
except those she made for herself.
“Sol. Malaprop’s” reflections on crime:—
Apropos the suggestion that certain gentlemen who
came here recently should be sent home, I offer no
opinion; but in a general way I think deportation
should be a great deal more common, and I would
liberally increase the number of offences for which
the noxious stranger within our gates could be put
outside. Multitudinous cranks in the cause of
“Liberty,” the glaring unmarried female who stands
at the entrance to New York harbor, have a habit
of talking as if everybody who gets here thereby
acquires an indubitable right to stay here for life,
just as I might have an indubitable right to stay
indefinitely on the premises of, say, Senator Gardiner
if I once happened to get in. They hold, in fact,
that the foreigner, being free, can visit here per-
manently, but we, not being free, and being also of
no account, can’t choose our visitors. The proposi-
tion strikes me as an ass. Deportation isn’t cruel
and a relic of medieval tyranny, like imprisonment.
The real mediaeval tyrant didn’t deport his victim.
The victim deported himself if he had luck,
the tyrant being in hot pursuit with his dungeon
under his arm to prevent him getting away. While on
this subject, it is worth while to note that the
United States exercises the right of exclusion and
deportation very liberally. And it puts other disa-
bilities on the alien. For instance, no person born
outside can become President unless he is at least
136 years old —that is to say, he is eligible, though
born abroad, if he was resident in the States when
the Constitution was adopted. This authorisation,
however, is seldom availed of. Speaking of penal-
ities,- I may mention that I don’t advocate branding,
at least not strongly, except where it doesn’t show.

There is no profit in saving
a few coppers in the purchase
price of a clock to have it cost
you many minutes of precious
time.
It is a simple matter to choose
a dependable timepiece; look for
the trade mark Westclox on the
dial and tag. It means a clock
or watch on which every econ-
omy has been effected that is
possible to modern methods, but
on which no saving has been
permitted which might lower
the quality in the slightest.
Westclox are not the lowest
priced clocks to be had, but
they are dependable, and as low
priced as we believe is consistent

Rexona Soap will quickly soothe. A
refreshing bath with Rexona Soap
and gently anointing with Rexona
will cool his skin and take away all
discomforts, so that baby and
mother will sleep quietly. The pure,
sweet emollients used in Rexona
Soap are suited to baby’s delicate
skin, and keep it in the best con-
dition. Rexona babies are con-
tented babies, because they feel
well cared for and comfortable.

Tiie Wall.
r*i HE red brick wall is grey with soot;
I Some broken glass of greenish hue
Makes ragged rampart of the crest —
It seems an insult to the blue
Of God that laughs above the town,
Serene, where alleyways run down.
There is no gate within this wall.
Outside along the rattling street
I hear the hucksters cry their wares,
I hear the noise of many lcet
But only as a deaf man seems
To know men moving through his dreams.
Yet in that wall on silver nights
There is a gap. Tlie white moon spills
Her magic on the desert sands,
And b.v the glistening, stony hills
Wet grasses from the iNile are green
In lands where I have never been.
The white moon turns the tiger-gold
Of those hot sands to silver-grey ;
She calls the lion from his lair,
She leads the jackal to his prey ;
She lures the grey owl from tue glooms
Of broken hills and treasure tombs.
The wall we knew was scarred with war;
Men with fierce swords had hacked it free,
Until upon that moony night
There was a road for you and me—
An ambushed way of strange alarms
That ever ended in your arms.
Your face was shaven like a slave’s,
Your arms were bare; the leopard skin
Gripped where the body’s splendid white
Seemed recompense tor tear —and sin.
Above rosettes in stone, upon
A watching tomb, the moonrays shone
On your dark head and on your spear.
Tne wind blew drift of sifted sands
Over the place where far below
A Pharaoh lay with folded hands.
But you—your blood was hot and red ;
You had no kinship with the dead.
The purple shadow of the wall,
The Pyramids with outlines dark,
The lion s feet upon the sand,
The baffled jackal’s angry bark ;
And far away, for tryst delayed,
An Arab the cithara played.
How lightly did you run to meet
My outheld hands! I felt my heart
Rise up to choke me ; then I knew
The fire of your kisses dart
Through every vein. And still there strives
That restless flame through many lives.
The Kiss.
Last night within a city room,
With patterned oilcloth on the floor,
With colored pampas grass in jars
And green plush mats before the door,
You kissed me, and I closed mj' eyes—
Oh, I was woman and was wise!
For I shut out the city room,
The pampas grass, the mats of plush....
There were fine sands about my feet,
And in the Theban hills the hush
Of sleeping kings was broken by
The lonely lion’s mateless cry.
The palm-trees rustled by the wall.
The olive groves were dark and still;
A reed pipe from the cupola
Above the baths rose sweet and shrill;
But in my hair and on my hands
I felt the dry soft drift of sands.
The moon was all about my face,
The stars were faint behind your head;
Brown Pharaoh in his gilded tomb
Stirred not, yet wept that he was dead ;
For dead men’s ears can hear men kiss.
And hearts embalmed can thrill to. this!
How cool beneath my burning palm
Your bared white shoulder, caught within
A thong of hide, a band of brass,
That looped your cloak of leopard-skin!
Your hand had loosened on your spear;
Love drunk with love forgets to fear.
Some little flower against the tomb
Sped spices on the scented night;
The mosques w'ere bubbles on the sky,
The graven pylons tall and w r hite;
And, as we clasped, upon my hands
I felt the brittle grains of sands.
A thousand years ago—what joys
Sowed seed to come to flower in you?
I can taste moonlight all the day;
It soaks my brain and body through.
What treasure did your kiss unearth
From some forgotten, far-off birth?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A MONTH of probation, following Denny
Deneen’s discovery of Mrs. Choquin-
die’s love affairs and Denny’s assault
and pursuit of Mr. Puttifoot, his journeyman
—“th’ whisp of a baldy-headed butcher-man’
—had readmitted Puttifoot to something
approaching his employer’s favor. Not quite
readmission; for on the evidence of the pur-
chase of a second bottle of eau-de-Cologne
Denny knew that Puttifoot still loved Mrs.
Choquindie, for whom he had purloined
certain ox-tail and lamb’s fry—and loved,
alas! above his station more than ever. For
Mrs. Choquindie, though not definitely order-
ing Puttifoot off the premises, showed that
she no more regarded him as Lord of the
Ox-tail and Master of the Lamb’s Fry after
Denny had made a fuss about their abstrac-
tion.
Still, on the 31st day after his disgrace,
Puttifoot took heart because of the new
kindness of Denny. That kindliness mani-
fested itself in the change of morning greet-
ing. For 30 days it had been: “So you re
there, are you, ine little whisp of a baldy-
headed butcher-man?” Or: “Have ye anny
more owe-de-Coioggin when ye go love-
makin’ with your hankychy?” Or. more dire of
insults: "Take a nice lamb’s fry wit’ you
whin you go shparkin’ Mrs. Chookwanday;
do, ye'll please me.” And this 31st day the
penance had been lifted by Denny saying,
“A good day to ye. Bill Puttifoot —here’s a
ticket for the shports to-morrow.”
So Puttifoot fooled himself that lie had
been removed from the suburbs of Denny’s
regard, and was now returned to the position
that a month ago had been his. And he was
well mistaken. Denny’s new kindliness was
because of the day after —the 17th of March
and Ireland.
Denny began St. Patrick’s Day with a
heart full of lovingkindliness for all men
and tliings : —except English government in
Ireland. He hurried Micky the boy over his
duties with the fowls and pigs, the cows,_ the
boots and the cream-separator, so that Micky
might not be late for the procession and the
sports; he sent the butcher’s boy home early
for the same reason, and he told Mr. Putti-
foot to hurry himself and miss nothing of
the great day; he even passed over that morn-
ing his customary literary studies in the
ledger.
At 9 o’clock his round, comfortable little
wife straightened the big green rosette in
the left buttonhole of his coat, and with
his boots throwing back at the sun the re-
flection of him and his new black beaufort
coat and vest and his striped trousers and
black slouched hat—the very shade of his
black beard —Denny Deneen stepped across
the road to his hotel. He looked upon the
crowded dining-rooms and saw that all was
good, and then he entered the long parlor
at the back of the bar-room, withdrawn from
public use for this day only, and now bright-
ened and furbished for the function of the
evening. That function, according to the
custom of 25 years—begun when Denny was
emerging from poverty into the ownership
of most of the trading activities of Quart-
pot Creek —consisted of eloquence and alco-
hol in almost equal parts. The alcohol pro-
vided by Denny was ready for all his guests ; of
the eloquence, Denny had the monopoly. With
his glass raised in homage he toasted the
health of the Irish patriots whose portraits
lined the walls —Wolfe Tone; Robert Emmet
speaking from the dock; Parnell, Redmond,
Davitt and all the illustrious of Ireland.
Denny saw that all was ready for the
evening—the doors to the bar locked and
but one door open, and that leading to the
coffee-room. Denny’s barman covered the
table with ammunition for the speechmaker
and anaesthetics for the audience —whisky
and beer, brandy and wine, cigars and cigar-
ettes ; and Denny personally looked over the
glassware for the feast.
That done, Denny left the room, locked the
door and pocketed the key; and being now
satisfied that he had made decent prepara-
tion for the anniversary function, he went
to the verandah and sunned himself, bowing
grandly to passing villagers and calling to
his intimates the compliments of the day.
“Good morning to you, Xavier!.... A
shinin’ day, Mrs. Garratt!.. . . Willie Schcan-
lon, if your father see you Hoggin’ that goat
ye have in y’r little cart he’ll give you young-
feller-me-lad. Shtop y’r beatin’ the poor
goat on St. Pathrick’s Day in the mornin’
....Good mornin’, Mistress Chookwanday,
good mornin’; I hope ye’ll be at the shports
early. Me brother’s lad Dan he will beat
them all at the hurlin’.”
He broke off suddenly from these unbend-
ings to the common populace that he might
greet Father Hanralian; smiling, ruddy,
Father Hanrahan, with a port-wine com-
plexion and a merry eye in his head—two
merry eyes, for that matter. Denny and
Father Hanrahan entered the hotel, pre-
sumably to talk over parish matters, and
came out again as if satisfied with the con-
ference. And then Denny and Father Han-
rahan crossed the road to Denny’s home,
and Micky brought out the big Roman-nosed
bay harnessed in the high cart with the
long shafts, and, Father Hanrahan climbing
up after Denny, Denny’s whip flicked the
old horse on his near-side hip, and the horse
gravely trotted off with his burden down the
hill to the creek and up the opposing rise,
and past Denny’s orchard to the Sports-
ground. Between them, Father Hanrahan
and Denny managed the sports; and at the
luncheon Denny made a speech that every-
body knew was but a rehearsal for the even-
ing function, when Denny assured himself
of a respectful audience by making himself
the host and the giver of fermented and
spirituous liquors.
The strong Australian sun and the scents
of the Australian bush made a day of beauty
in that meeting of the strong; there was
tireless energy asking for a longer day when
the short twilight came, to deepen into star-
darkness almost as quickly as the sun had
dropped behind the granite range.
Denny drove the priest back to dinner,
and then drove him home, and at 8 o’clock
a newly-dressed and renovated Denny was
ready for his hour of eloquence. As he
entered the hotel Puttifoot tried to speak to
him, but Denny put him aside for higher
things, and Puttifoot, impatient to join Mrs.
Choquindie, was left waiting the pleasure of
Dennv Imperator.
Denny went to the prepared parlor, opened
the door and stood within to receive his
guests. All male guests they were, the aris-
tocracy of Quart-pot. including the President
and the Clerk of the Divisional Board; they
filed in to the number of 50. and formed them-
selves into a hollow square enclosing the
table and the drinks.
The President of the Divisional Board, at
the instance of Denny, proposed “The Day
We Celebrate” ; and Ned Murphy, most lov-
able of men. supported it with eloquence, and
the assemblage carried it with alcoholic
accompaniments. And then came the crowded
hour of Denny Deneen. He spoke delib-
erately enough, knowing that if he missed
a connection of phrases he might be forced
to begin all over again; but as he warmed
he hastened, and as he hastened virtuous in-
dignation took charge of him
“Fill your glasses,” said Denny Deneen,
“an’ whin ye drink a toast drink it down
to the dhregs uv it an’ no heel-taps. W e’re
goin’ to dhrink the health of ivery man of
these glorious patriots that look down upon
us from their places on the walls —look down

Is a dull, nagging backache making you miserable? Do
sharp, knife-like pains go through you at every sudden
move? Do you feel weak, tired, all worn-out—as if
you just can’t keep going? It’s time, then, you found
out the cause of the trouble and made some effort to
correct it. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold,
strain or overwork has probably weakened the kidneys,
and that is why you suffer that dull, depressing back-
ache and those sudden, stabbing pains. You may have
daily headaches, too, with spells of dizziness and some
annoying kidney irregularity. Don’t wait until serious
or chronic kidney disease sets in. Get back your health
while you can. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Doan’s have helped scores of Sydney folks. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. Mayliew, 48 Alexander Street, Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“l suffered
from backache and rheumatic pains all over my body, and was sometimes so bad
that I was almost crippled. I could not stoop without enduring torture; in fact,
every movement meant increased suffering, and I often used to feel quite knocked
up. To make matters worse, my rest at night was disturbed and I was also
subject to dizzy attacks. One day a friend heard Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
very well spoken of,, so she advised me to try them. I bought a bottle without
delay, and after taking them for a few days my health began to improve, so I
persevered, and by the time I had used three bottles I was cured. The backache
and rheumatism have gone completely, and I feel splendid in every way.”
Four years later Mrs. Mayhew says“ Since giving my testimony for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills I have had a slight return of kidney trouble, but I again
used this fine remedy and it soon fixed me up. I strongly recommend Doan’s Pills
to all who suffer with their kidneys.”
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street, Sydney, says:—“For a long
time I suffered torture from backache and kidney trouble.; The pains in my back
were very severe, and I have been so bad that I could not attend to my work, as
every movement caused positive torture.. The kidney secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy and containing a red sediment. I was also subject to
dizzy feeling's and could not sleeu properly at night. Nothing I took gave me
any permanent relief, but one day, when I was feeling very bad, I heard good
reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only banished the backache, but
strengthened and toned up my kidneys. and improved my general health.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above eight years later, and says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always have a bottle in the
house. By taking them every now and again my kidneys keep in a healthy state,
and I am never troubled with backache.”

. shplendid work they began. ’Tis fine that in
our time we have seen Catholics and Pro-
testants united for Home Rule. We see in
the shplendid Sinn Fein flag the first unsec-
tarian banner ever unfurled in Ireland or
anny other place the Shaxons ever got a
hould of. There in the colors of it are the
Orange and the Green united by the White
—united by a common love of Ireland and
a united determination to make the Ould
Land free. For we know now* that the rea-
son for 700 years’ oppression was not reli-
gious difference —that was but used by the
hucksters and traders who know an Irish
Republic means first high Customs duties,
and, therefore, an interference wit’ the
veshted interests that slitand for the Free
Trade that has kept poor Ireland poor whin
it should have been rich and happy. ’Tis
Fischalism an’ not Rome; ’tis Freetrade an’
not Irish incapacity for gover’mint that
has stud in the way of Home Rule. There’s
never a Holy War in Lapland where there
is only icebergs an’ Polar bears to shteal;
’tis the merchants of Liverpool that hates
the thought of Irish independence, because
Galway would be a great port for American
thrade. Money it is on the one side and the
unkillable love of Ireland on the other.
Anny man who knows human nature knows
that in the end—bitter or shweet as that end
may be —love will beat money, an’ that thrue
pathriotism is the shtrongest love of all, be-
cause it asks nothing more than to give
itself to its duty.
“Wit’ these few worrds of inthroduction I
ask you to charge your glasses while we
dhrink long life to the dead min who carried
on the gallant shtruggle before our time.
Dhrrink to the gallery of heroes as I address
them !
“To you, Wolfe, Tone,- a great man and
shplendid pathriot. Dead you are, but your
name will live while water runs down hill.
Dhrink hearrty.”
He emptied his own glass, stroked his
beard, look benevolently upon his guests and
ordered them to fill the glasses again.
“Here’s to Robert Emmet, noble, glorious
Robert Emmet. We know his life and that
nothing became him in it more than the
cause an’ manner of his death. His speech
from the dock is one of the gems of Irish
literature. He cannot be forgotten while
men respect the good and the noble and the
thrue. To you, Robert Emmet, most glorious
of Irish pathriots—drink hearty, lads.'
“An’ fill your glasses to the memory of
('-harles Stuart Parnell. He”
At that moment the door opened; the bald
head and the little face and half the body of
William Puttifoot, resplendent in its holi-
day clothes, appeared.
"Mister Deneen, please.”
He interrupted Denny Deneen, and went
no farther.
His black beard bristling, Denny turned
on his servant indignantly: “What dto ye
mane, openin’ that door whin I’m in here
conversin’ wit,’ me privit frien’s?”
“Mr. Deneen, I wanted to arst you if”- -
“You wanted to ask me, did you? You’ll
open the door of me privit room whin I’m
addressin’ me privit frien’s on the wrongs
of Ireland an’ the noble men who died for
her. An’ you Avant to ask me! Get out to
—to^ —anywhere you like out o’ that, this
rninit—get you out!”
“But, Mister”
“Blasht you, get you out! Ye have no
manners. Openin’ the privit door o’ me
privit room whin I’m addressin’ me privit
men’s. The manners of a pig ye have!
Openin’ privit doors! Where was ye born?
In a paddock wit’ the shliprails down, I bet
you. Out wit’ you! Not a worrd —out wit’
you !”
Almost suffocated by the torrent of words,
Puttifoot uttered a despairing moan that
apparently gave the younger guests much
delight, and retreated, closing the door upon
himself. Denny Deneen, ridding himself of
his indignation by sundry snortings and half-
suppressed growlings to his beard, took up
Charles Stuart Parnell where he had laid
him down for the defeat of Puttifoot.
“Charles Stuart Parnell,” said Denny,
“single-hearted worker for Ireland! \e
could have no better example of English
hypocrisy than the fact that the discovery
that Parnell had the ordinary passions and
affections of a man put back Home Rule for
JO years. And nobody lias yet proved that
his guilty partner in that imprudent but
very natural sin was not the innicent in-
shtrument of a Shaxon plot against Home
Rule, financed wit’ English gould. I dhrink
to you, Charles Stuart Parnell; your privit
faults are not the business of anny man;
your great work in the great cause is more
than absolution for bigger sins than anny
ye ever d d, Dhrink hearty, me boys.
“Fill ’em again to drink to the healt’ o’
Michael Davitt. Ah, Michael Davitt, ye look
down on a more brilliant and hopeful time
than the drab days ye labored in. There
was no rosy dalin of success for ye ; but work
is work, service is service, and the unoshten-
taytious manner of your service does not
make your service one bit the less. Here’s
to you, Michael Davitt! Your memory will
be green in Ireland until the ould wimmiin
shtuff a dozen pillows wit’ the feathers o’
one wren.
“Fillum up agin, me boys, for the toasht
of John Redmond.”
The door opened again and at it appeared
William Puttifoot, despairing almost, but
prepared to force a hearing this time even
if he died for it.
“Fill your glasses. It is to you, John
Redmond”- ——
“Mr. Deneen, I want to arst if”
"Ye want to ask what? You little whisp
of a baldy-headed butcher man, you’ll come
here shtoppin’ me iloquence on "the shplen-
did path riots -of Ireland, have you? Hell to
you! Thief of lamb’s fry and oxh-tail!
Take your ugly face from me house or I’ll
rub it on the door till it looks like a knot
in the timber. Out wit’ you !”
The door had closed before Denny had
covered half the distance to it.
“Coinin’ here to ask, says he,” said Denny,
returning to his place at the head of the'
table, “an’ can’t ask annything. Opens his
mout’ an’ no words to him—shtandin’ there
interruptin’ me iloquence, an’ he as helpless
as a boozer thryin’ to shpit. The Devil have
him! And where was I? I know. I was
just tellin’ you to fill your glasses to John
Redmond —ye see his picture there on the
wall before us. Wit’ his eyes like the
eagie’s and the heart of him high for his
country and the soul of him on its knees
prayin’ for relief from the oppressor. John
Redmond, the”
“Mister Deneen, I just wanted to ask
if” ——
Denny turned as he jumped. “Ye dam’
schcrap of paper,” said Denny, as he rushed
at Puttifoot, "I’ll tear you up as Carson did
the Home Rule Act; an’ they put him in the
Guv’mint inshtead of bangin’ him.”
The door had closed when he reached it,
but Denny tore it open, pursued the escaping
Puttifoot, who had just enough courage to
open the door in prosecution of his claim,
but not enough to stay when he saw Denny’s
black beard bristling. At the end of the
passage Denny caught him and held him as
he would hold a rabbit.
“Now, then, you dirty little scut,” said
Denny, “tell me, which of the wowsers was
it sooled you on to insult Saint Patrick’s
Day by interruptin’ me iloquence?”
"Nobody did, Mr. Deneen —not a one.”
“Liar!” said Denny, and struck him.
“For God’s sake, Mr. Deneen. Would I
insult you?”
“You thried to shteal me oxh-tail an’ me
lamb’s fry,” said Denny, suspending punish-
ment, but still suspicious, and holding Putti-
foot fast.
“But them was perks, Mr. Deneen.”
“Perks!” said Denny, shaking him and
playing kookaburra to Puttifoot’s snake.
“Perks? An’ wadn’t the wowsers call in-
sultin’ San Pathrick ‘perks’?”
“S’elp me, Mr. Deneen, I didn’t. I on’y
came to arst you to let me in the store to get
some lollies for the kids. I on’y wanted to
get lollies—l’ll pay for ’em.”
“Oh, lollies, is it —an’ what kids do they
be?”
"The kids at the Cartholic-school concert.
The lollies was forgot.”
Denny released him. “Well, ’tis a good
heart you have. There’s my privit key.
Ye’ll take two tins o’ lollies an’ free tins o’
biskits an’ then charge them to me. An’ be-
fore ye go, come in here.”
Puttifoot protesting, Denny dragged him
the length of the passage, opened the parlor
door and pushed Puttifoot into the Holy of
Holies sacred to the Seventeenth of March
and Ireland. And there he put a glass into
Puttifoot’s hand and poured into it a
second mate’s nip of whisky, and in that
moment seized the opportunity for another
speech.
“Hould it in your fisht, man. An’ now
dlirink an’ iill your glass again. Gentlemen,
when I adjourned I was talkin’ of John
Redmond. Dhrink to him, an’ that’s enough
of him. Now charge your glasses for the last
toasht. ‘The frinds of Ireland.’ There are
t’ousan’s of men not Irish an’ not Catholics
who want to see Ireland independint and
the humblest of them is equal to the best of
us, because they believe in us wit’out our
motive of love of country. Why, here this
very night one of these outside frinds kem
to me wit’ the fire of hatred of injustice
burnin’ in ’um when he found that the
Catholic, childer at the school concert have
no lollies. He risked dismembermint an’
the fisht of me he’s felt before, but he did his
duty; an’ may good luck go wit’ , him.
Dhrrink then to the sympathisers w T it’ Ire-
land—coupled wit’ the name o’ Bill Putti-
foot.”
*** * •
“Bill,” said Denny next morning, as Putti-
foot, glad to be re-admitted to absolute favor
so that while he used knife and chopper and
saw he sang of love as blithely as a bird
upon a bough—“ Bill, me man, if ye have
a few kidneys and a shweetbread, or a couple
o’ chops wit’out an order, y’ might dhrop
them at Mrs. Chookwanday’s. Must be
hard to be a widdy—bitther bread an gray -
vlous cup an’ lonely bed an’ food in
An’ a oxh-tail or a lamb’s fry don’t be out ol
the way when you can shpare it, Bill,
He almost ran away to avoid thanks, and
Bill expressed his gratitude in song:—i
“For the sa-ake of me lad-ay
I’ll conk-er or a-die-a.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If I should sometimes seem
To be—well, flippant rather,
Believe me, I’d not dream
Of making light of Sin
Or venturing on thin,
Thin ice, or slipping in
The slick end of the wedge,
Or getting near the edge.
My manner may at times be bland,
But I’m a model husband and
A truly moral father.
I lov# a naked dame,
I woo a naked beauty;
I own it without shame,
And freely I admit
That I find joy in it.
Let each man have his chit
All rouged and over-dressed.
I love my bare girl best.
Yes! Let Age scoff, or Youth,
I love the naked Truth,
I am the slave of Duty.*
So if at times I dare
To fit Truth with a garter,
Or twine carnations in her hair,
Or, dandling her upon my knee,
Take precious care that padlocked be
Her immemorial chastity,
Why should the heathen rage and scoff
When I won’t take the padlock off?
Or why should prudes scream in my face
That I’m outside in every race?
I am at least a starter.
I lie (let who will chide),
And Truth, devoid of raiment,
Lies snuggled close against my side.
I kiss her lips. I kiss
Her eyes. Most sweet it is
To kiss a girl like this.
I kiss her elbows, knees.
I tickle her and tease.
But still she smiles contentedly,
For if I needs must pay her, she
May have my soul for payment.

THE WONDER RUGBY BALL.
This Ball has been designed by the world’s greatest Footballer, H. H. (Daily)
Messenger. The principle of the raisedi ribs, two on bottom and two on top (see
sketch above), is to deflect the air currents, thus ensuring accuracy in passing
and trueness in flight—very essential to successful goal-kicking. It has been
tried out by several Rugby Players, who acclaim it as the finest Ball they ever
played with.
Each Ball is of Regulation Size and Weight, made from specially-selected
oak-tanned leather, and guaranteed to be Perfect in Shape, and is fitted with
best octotropical red rubber bladder with reinforced seams.
Price 22/6 each.
EVERY BALL FULLY GUARANTEED.
FOOTBALL BLADDERS.
Special red rubber.
Every seam reinforced with a strip of pure para rubber, which
increases the life of a bladder.
