This Blacking - is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

AUTION.
The extraordinary regulation of Rowland's Macassar

Offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared U confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland 4 Sons, of 80,
Batten Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no -Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto
except those made by them, and which hear.their
name in red ink on the wrappers.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe, lie has devoted a life-
time to (he study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more (in-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentcdncss, weakness or pains
in the back, Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the cars and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which load to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On x-oceipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may bo cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you bo perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist yon in restoring
some poor friend to health even after Ids ease has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE ROUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

Dr. M. PEEKY,
M.R.0.5., L.S A , &c.,
SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical 80-r lof N.S. IF. Late House Sur-
geon to the Ctreat JSorthern Hospital, Lond'.n
T am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the t-. eatment of this class of Hisense, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaint* has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It,is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
hold in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nov.
6th. 7th and 6th. 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified .lien entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from there diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My Qualifications I invite the fullest investigation into. For some,considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observing the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and soecious promises and
if I undertake the case ’
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me' to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1891.
On Various Kinds of Strikes.
Men on strike should be put down by the strong arm of
the law— Extract from speech by Sir Edward Watkin,
British M. P.
When the British railway-strike was in full
blast, Sir Edavard Watkin, M.P., part of
the aggregate wisdom of the British nation,
offered a suggestion which at once aroused
a responsive thrill through all the wide
Avorld of Capital. The necessity for “put-
ting down ” men avlio go on strike is a fact
that is apparent to the soul of Property in
all parts of the globe. In almost every
“civilised” land provision has been made by
Ihav for extinguishing the masses Avhen they
have a difference of opinion with their em-
ployers, and Avhere no special provision
exists, or where the capitalist finds it in-
adequate, the men who administer the laws
eagerly come to the rescue of the law-makers.
In Queensland, for example, the same
Government which prohibits the unionist
shearers carrying arms has allowed the
squatters to make a Avholesale distribution of
weapons among their blackleg employes, and
should the latter provoke a conflict the battle
Avill be one of guns versus road-metal ; and
when the campaign is over, and the dead
are carried aAvay, and the blood is mopped
up, a squatting J.P. Avill make any affidavits
that may be needful, and another squatting
UP. will hold any inquiry that may seem
essential, and the strikers will have been
“ put down ” effectually. The expedient is
a coarse and common one at the best, but
still it will answer its purpose. In Germany,
the other day, the employes in a large
factory sent one of their number to inter-
view the proprietor concerning a rise of
wages, but that energetic capitalist promptly
gave him into custody on a charge of ‘ ‘ extor-
tion,” and the sentence that ensued was six
months’ imprisonment Avith hard labour. The
English law, however, has struck a greater
and grander inspiration even than this.
When the railway strike Avas in progress,
and Property Avas suffering from temporary
panic, the Recorder of Plymouth asserted
the cause of peace and order by deciding
that any man going on strike was liable to
imprisonment on a charge of “intimidating”
his boss ; and the superior courts and the
House of Commons having both endorsed
this reading of the statute, the result is that
everybody who manifests signs of active
dissatisfaction with his employment can be
promptly lodged in gaol as a means of bring-
ing him to a better frame of mind. And in
spite of these lavish powers the British
capitalist, like his brother in Australia, is
not content, and desires further legislation
with a vieAv to “ putting down ” men who go
on strike. It is more than probable that his
desire will be gratified.
* # «■
Yet if the laAv, either in Australia or any
other part of the globe, is willing to “ put
down ” strikes in the largest and Avidest
sense of the term, The Bulletin, regarding
the matter from a purely democratic stand-
point, will give it every support within its
power ; and if it is prepared to “ put down ”
strikers of every kind and variety, The
Bulletin will gladly assist in the good work.
If the men who originate strikes and the
men who go on strike can be suppressed by
fine and imprisonment, then let them be
suppressed by that or any other convenient
means—so long as all descriptions of strikers
go to gaol together. Unfortunately, how-
e\ r er, the world has learned to regard strikes
in one limited sense, and the wide and
general meaning of the term is entirely lost.
The capitalist not only makes the laws, but
he is allowed to make the language of the
nation, or at all eA r ents he alters and trans-
forms the language to suit his own ends. The
worker, avlio helped to appoint the capitalist
as his law-maker, protests against this pro-
ceeding at times, but at the next election he
returns either the same capitalist or another
just like him, and the process goes on as
before. Consequently it folloivs that the
workman who goes on strike is legally
defined as going on strike in the baldest
and most uncompromising manner, while
the capitalist who goes on strike is not
defined at all, and is merely alluded to in the
papers as a “revival in trade ” ora “ sign of
reneAved prosperity.” Yet every time a
statement appears in print to the effect that
“better prices were realised” in some
branch of commerce, somebody must be on
strike, and the matter requires to be looked
into at once by the bilious eye of the laAv.
And so long as the existing statutes against
strikes are in force it is necessary that
cavalry should be called out to overaAve the
individual Avho realised those enhanced
prices, and that big guns should be pointed
at his warehouse, and that the Riot Act
should be read to him ; and if he refuses to
disperse in various directions Avhen sum-
moned to do so he should be charged by
police and troops, and promptly demolished.
* * *
A strike, in almost every case, is simply a
resolution on the part of a man who deals in
a certain commodity to raise the selling price
of his wares. The shearer who wants more
Avages for the same hours, or—what amounts
to the same thing—fewer hours for the same
wages, is in exactly the same position as the
grocer Avho charges an extra penny per lb.
for his tea ; the one man has his labour to
sell, and the other man sells his alleged
Chinese herb, and they both want to get
more money and to give no more goods in
exchange. When the shearer’s employer—
the squatter—demands that he shall sell his
goods at the old rate, he finds his is
in that condition which is technically des-
cribed as being on strike ; and then he pro-
ceeds to hunt up mouldy enactments Avhich
will enable him to have this overbearing
democrat arrested for striking, and the
standing army is telegraphed for, and it is
announced in the papers that the floodgates
of society have broken, and the old land-
marks are destroyed, and the cohesion by
which things are held together has been
obliterated. And when the grocer’s em-
ployer—the same squatter—demands that he
shall sell his goods at the old price, then he
finds that the grocer is also on strike ; but
the term is not applied in his case, neither is
the standing army telegraphed for, and no
troops are stationed in front of the grocer
lest he should break out, and it doesn’t occur
to anybody that the Avorld is fast sliding
down that track which describes an angle of
45 degrees and ends in perdition. From
sheer force of habit the grocer is allowed to
strike without anybody getting in the least
degree excited over the fact; and yet if—
Avhen that dealer in victuals has marked
butter up from Is. 3d. to Is. 9d.— anyone
should insist on his right to buy it at the old
figure, it would be found that the grocer was
as truly on strike as any shearer or artisan
in Australia or elsewhere.
* * *
And in like manner the landlord who
raises his rent is on strike in a violent form
—in fact, his chronic strike is a greater social
upheaval than all the combined strikes of
the combined labourers of the earth since
the Avorld began. He sells the right to
occupy certain land or premises just as the
artizan sells his labour, and his employer is
the tenant just as the artizan’s employer is
the capitalist. When he raises the rent,
Avhich is an event of more frequent occur-
ence than any other event on earth, he
strikes against his employer, and if the latter
proceeded to argue the point instead of
knocking under in abject submission he
would realise the full force and vigour of the
movement very shortly aftenvards. BetAveen
the land-grabber Avho Avants more rent for his
patch of earth, and the labourer who wants
more rent for his muscles, there is no differ-
ence whatever except in name ; and the
difference in name arises solely from the fact
that the land-grabber makes the laws, and
legislates against the other man’s strike,
while his own strike passes unnoticed. And
as he also oaviis the newspapers, it natur-
ally follows that the strike of the man
with 455. a Aveek appears under the heading
of “Brutal Outrage by Unionists,” while the
strike of the person with £5OOO a year is
published as “ Wonderful Progress of the
Country,” And in the same way every in-
dividual who has anything to sell and
demands a higher price for it than before—
every individual from the great importer in
York-street doAvn to the tinker, and including
every variety of human being who deals in
anything, or wants anything—goes on strike
periodically and is on strike most of the
time. How much he is on strike anybody
caji find out by noting when softgoods go
up, and then calling round at the warehouse
of Treasurer M‘Millan, and insisting on
buying these same softgoods at the old rate.
And if, when he can’t get them, he uses the
same language which the squatter uses to
the shearer when the shearer has gone up
and is also unobtainable at the original figure,
he will presently have cause to realise that
there are many different kinds of strikes,
and that the strike of a man with a
big stone-front warehouse has got to
be viewed in a very different light from
that of a man with only a bundle of blankets
and a billy-can. And if, in addition, he
publishes a column of strong language con-
cerning M‘Millan, and states that that good-
humoured and gentle-looking little man is a
coarse and brutal-looking individual with
brows like a gaol door-mat, and that he is
camping in a threatening attitude in York-
street; and alludes to him generally as if ho
were only a shearer camping at Clermont,
he will shortly have further cause to under-
stand that a prosperous citizen who is out on
strike must not be libelled with impunity.
« * *
The favourite answer of the capitalist to
such theories as this is that the two cases
are parallel in theory only. When that
mighty landlord, the gilded Burdekin, goes
on strike for higher wages from his tenant,
he does not demonstrate with banners, or
hold excited meetings, or agitate about his
ivrongs ; and when Treasurer M‘Millan
puts up the wholesale price of his soft-goods,
and thus strikes the whole population of the
country, he neither goes about armed, nor
forms himself into an excited mob on
Circular Quay. In fact, as the nation, with
a docility that is amazing to contemplate,
ahvays gives in, sooner or later, to the tribe
of M‘Millan and Burdekin, it would be
strange if they did. But if Burdekin’s
rents had been steadily declining for forty
years or more, instead of increasing, and had
at last reached a point at which his whole vast
properties only yielded him a bare subsistence
—if, when he went on strike by demanding
a small increase, his income ivas immediately
stopped and he was boycotted by the entire
nation—if, in addition to this, special con-
stables were sworn in to Avatch him and the
artillery were sent down to keep an eye upon
him, and bills were introduced in Parli-
ment for his suppression, and the news-
papers called him a low incendiary Avhenever
a fire took place anyAvhere within ten miles
of him, and alluded to him as a “Brutal
Outrage ” when there Avas a fight in a public-
house that he had never heard of between
tAvo men Avhom he had never seen, and if
people wrote in the correspondence column
stating that they had passed his house
and were surprised to see Avhat a hideous-
looking ruffian he was—then the smiling
and affable Burdekin would be the
most patient individual on earth if he
did nothing Avorse than Avalk through the
street Avith a flag and hold an indignation
meeting. And if M‘Millan’s importing
business were boycotted by the entire popu-
lation because of an extra halfpenny per
yard on the calico, and he Avere left with
nothing but a lot of unsaleable stock and
some bills which he could not provide for,
and in addition the Telegrabh and the S.M.
Herald and the Argus demanded that he
should be charged by cavalry and have guns
fired at him, it is possible that even that
placid capitalist would rile up and dosomething
which he might not do under other circum-
stances. And if, instead of one Burdekin
and one M‘Millan, there Avere eighteen
thousand of them, all suffering from the same
grievance, and all being equally insulted
by the newspapers, the Government, the
churches, and all the other adjuncts
of respectability, and all being harassed
by the police and Avatched by troops
Avho were exhorted to “ fire low ”
when they came along ; and these troubles
arose entirely from the fact that Bur-
dekin had raised the rent of a Aveather-
board cottage, and thus gone on strike
against his tenant —Avell, under such condi-
tions, we would be more anxious to give any
or all of these capitalists a wide berth, than
to steer clear of the most truculent shearer
among all the shearers now on strike in
Queensland.
* * *
The theory that strikes ought to be
abolished, and strikers “put down” by the
strong arm of the Lw, is one that has already
commended itself strongly to the “governing
classes” in Australia, and, on the whole,
The Bulletin is inclined to encourage this
policy, principally out of curiosity to watch
the results of such an experiment. It Avants
to see some statute passed which will put
doAvn the entire gathering of landlords when
they strike for higher rents, and which will
extinguish the importer when he strikes for
more profits, and squash the whole tribe of
employers Avhen they strike for more work
at the same Avages, or the same Avork at less
Avages, and come down heavily on the usurer
Avhen he strikes for more interest, and then,
if a clause is tacked on providing that the
labourer shall also bo suppressed Avhen hr,
wants to go on strike, this paper would sup-
port the measure gladly. But Avhen a Parlia-
ment, composed of men who have been on
various kinds of strikes all their lives, and
supported by a gang of capitalists, employers,
landlords, merchants, bankers, and the like,
whose whole existence is one long strike,
proposes to abolish the only kind of strike
that is not its own particular strike, the
performance is the lowest kind of
hypocrisy. And when the Herald
Argus reproaches the labourers of A f .
because of the violence which is alwav/ 1 a
to break out—but Avhich never doesb r a
when they attempt to raise the price Tn
one article which they have for salo° > •
worth Avhile to reflect Avhat sort of cm 1 18
the placid proprietor of either paper ufiS
indulge in if he were harried by speG 1
constables armed Avith guns, because he lv 1
raised the price of a display “ad.” on tl
inside page ; and with this possibility ?!
view, we come to the conclusion that thin J
might easily be a great deal worse than thL
are—for the capitalist.
Maoriland and Federation.
Tim Maori land Parliament which sent delegates
to the Australian Federal Convention was wise
Had it declined to send them it would perhaps
have been wiser still. The wisdom displayed
was partly shown in the choice of representa-
tives, but chielly in the character of the resolu-
tion which declared that: “ While New Zea-
land sympathises with the aspirations of the
Australian colonies for a Federal Union, such
delegates [the N.Z. ones] are not authorised
to bind this colony to come under any Federal
Constitution.” Oddly enough, both delegates
were men who had held commissions in the
British regular forces. Sir George Grey, the
elder of the two, had not alone been a soldier
but, as a vice-regent in troublous times and
trying circumstances, had secured a reputation
second to none—a reputation which shone the
brighter for the neglect and slights intended to
tarnish it. Yet, not even to such a delegate
with such a name, would the Maoriland Parlia-
ment entrust binding powers a tithe so im-
portant as those entrusted by the Church to the
poor French, Italian, Spanish, and Irish peasant
who, after a veneer of doubtful Latin and more
doubtful theology, is sent into the world as a
priest to loosen the bonds of repentant sinners
and tie with uncompromising tightness the
meshes of mockers. That there is some cogent
reason for New Zealand’s action is obvious.
Let us discover what that reason is.
# # #
It occasionally happens that a representative
body, whose members are not perceptibly
superior to their constituents in mental endow-
ments, is guided by a sort of intuitive common-
sense to see at a glance where the true interest
of the country lies. It was so in England
when, before Cromwell throttled the First
Republic of 1649-53—an omnipotent Cromwell
will be required to strangle the next one—the
peers were voted “ useless and dangerous ” and
the monarch “unnecessary, burthensome and
dangerousin America when, with halters
round their necks, the members at Philadelphia
proclaimed the glad tidings of national inde-
pendence ; and in France when the majority
voted that Louis Seize and his breed had lasted
so long that it was high time to shorten them. It
will be so in the near future when European
assemblies, satisfied that kings and kaisers
should be obliged to work for a living if only to
support their families without appealing to pub-
lic charity, will send properly vised passports to
the various monarchs, with gendarmes to convey
the rulers to the frontiers—on tumbrils, if
necessary. The same sound judgment prompted
even the corrupt so-called Irish Parliament of
90 years ago to look with misgiving on the offer
of a closer union with the big island over the
way, till British gold, to meet the extravagance
of the members and British titles to satisfy the
vanity of their wives, prevailed over pati’iotism
and Ireland became a huge workhouse with
peasants for paupers and bankrupt landlords for
overseers. It is an instinctive fear of the pos-
sible result that induces the Maorilanders to
stand like the fox in the fable at the mouth
of the sick lion’s cave, while wishing the
occupant a speedy recovery, declining to go
inside. As the footsteps all going the one way
prompted the fox to remain bowing at the
entrance in order to avoid complications, so
Maoriland is induced to stand and wait by the
reflection that, whenever a small island allies
itself with a large one, the big partner usually
gets on top and stays there.
* * *
It is always thus when islands, having in
themselves all the physical powers of area,
climate, soil and productions enabling them to
become great nations, are joined to continental
countries whether by force or otherwise. Ex-
cept under favouring circumstances, such as
when the island is so small as to make indepen-
dent sovereignty dangerous or grotesque, the
very wash of the sea is a standing protest
against outside rule. This protest becomes
louder and louder as the superficial extent of
the land and the breadth of the intervening
ocean become greater. There are persons who
affect to believe that there is no difference
between land and water frontiers—that the in-
clusion of Maoriland in a confederacy containing
New South Wales is much the same as that of
Victoria in one including Northern Queens-
land. Such people see no difference between a
Canada governed or controlled from London,
where, even if Canadian representatives were
allowed, they would bo powerless, and a sub-
divided Canada controlled from Washington,
where each State of the present Dominion would
have the same rights as New York or Ohio.
But there is a fundamental distinction, one
whose roots lie deep in human nature itself,
and give every promise of remaining firm this
side of the millennium. The mistake is simii r
in kind to that made by the Imperial Federa-
tionists, who see no reason why all English-
speaking lands should not respond to the action
of political nerves, whose central ganglion was
situated by the Thames. Yet these doctrinaires
would be the first to oppose the proposals to
fix the centre of political gravity in its proper
place on the North American continent, where
the bulk of the people of English speech reside.
In the life of a nation, the day is not so very
distant when what is called the Anglo-Saxon
tongue—probably because no mediaeval English-
man if brought to life would now understand
it—will be spoken by a population of sonic
hundreds of millions between the Gulf of Mexico


and the Arctic circle. To suppose that they
would take either advice or dictation from
London is a supposition worthy of those who
dedicated primroses to Disraeli.
# * *
When giving instructions to its delegates to
hear and see and speak before the Convention
without empowering them to act, the N.Z.
Parliament must have had an eye on the dismal
historical failures resulting from the efforts
made to weld into one administrative system
nations with no conterminous land boundaries
—nations, moreover, whose extent and resources
proclaimed that well-being lay in independence
alone. Take, for example, the case of Britain.
The Romans found her savage but free ; they
left her with a thin veneer of civilisation
and a thick coating of helplessness. No
matter how refined or populous or power-
ful the island became, she would still have
been but a province, and her people provincials,
so long as the strings of government were
arranged and pulled in Rome. When, after
centuries of struggle, the Britons were enslaved
or massacred or driven into the high lands of
Wales or Cornwall, the semi-savage Saxons,
Jutes, Angles, Danes, and other northern cut-
throats were being knit together and started on
the road to progress. Then came the love-son
of the Norman tanner’s daughter with the un-
employed Thugs of Western Europe at his
heels, and down went the English like nine-
pins. Fortunately for the country, however,
the Norman and Angevin princes made London
their head-quarters, so that in time the victim
became the parent State and the victor the pro-
vince. The enthusiasts of the time thought it
possible that the whole of England and the half
of France would be happy together when
governed from London. But Nature had been
beforehand by interposing a narrow strip of sea
not one-sixtieth so wide as that rolling between
Australia and New Zealand. This insignificant
strait proclaimed in a manner not to be misun-
derstood that nothing but force could hold the
two sides in the same political system. Even
had the Normans behaved as mercilessly to the
whole country as they did to Yorkshire and
Durham, and peopled the land with French
adventurers, the descendants of the latter would
have called themselves Englishmen and have
struggled till they obtained a political divorce.
It may be said that it would have been better
for both Briton and Gaul had they obeyed one
Government, whether the latter was on the
Thames or on the Seine. Millions of lives and
billions of money might have been saved by
such a federation. To the philosopher in his
closet such a view may recommend itself. He
may even express regret that men the world
over do not obey the same central administra-
tion, speak the same tongue, profess the same
faith, and resemble each other like rows of
pins turned out by the same machine. In
such a world there would be no room for Alex-
anders and Napoleons, for Cromwells and
Fredericks —perhaps not even for Walpoles,
Chathams and— Parkeses. But the practical
man has to deal with facts as he finds them.
And the fact of all others that presses for
recognition is that, in nearly every case, the
political union of large islands with continents,
or even with islands much larger than them-
selves, is calamitous to the junior partners.
* * *
It may be said that the union between
England and America was a happy one till
Farmer George and his friends forced the other
side to demand a judicial separation. The
colonists certainly were not backward in sing-
ing the virtues of the first two Guelphs and,
for awhile, expressing admiration for the
talents of the third. But it should be borne
in mind that the continent was then the
junior partner and the island the senior.
It would be difficult now, had the connec-
tion held and federation taken place. The
House of Commons would contain about 400
Yankees, including a fair sprinkling of New
York bosses and Western cowboys, while the
Lords would be swamped with pork-men from
Chicago and wooden-nutmeg merchants from
New England. The administration of the navy,
of the army, of India, and of the Colonies would
now be in the hands of men who wore goatees
and spoke through their noses. It would not
he very long before the British began to suspect
that, when an island and a continent went
hunting together, the latter took all the deer
and left the rabbits to their allies. Look at
Ireland again. But a narrow ribbon of water
separates it, not from a continent to be sure,
hut from another island three times as large,
ten times as powerful, and thirty times as
rich. Had Elizabeth and Cromwell done
their work thoroughly instead of half doing
it—had they cleared out the Celts as effec-
tually as the Saxons cleared them out of
Britain or as the English were swept out of
Northumbria by William and had they
dotted the devastated island with British
settlers, the progeny of the latter would long
since have been Irishmen and the island an in-
dependent nation. For had there been no
religious or racial differences political severance
would long since have taken place. The same
might be said of the Japan Islands, had they
been peopled by Chinese and yoked to the
Chinese government system. Directly they
became populous, discovered their own
resources and extent, were permeated by
national traditions and recognised their isola-
tion, there would be an end to rule from Pekin.

All the arguments that can be used regarding
the ocean’s power to keep nations politioally
apart apply with peculiar force to the proposed
inclusion of New Zealand in the Australian co-
partnership. The former is as large as the
United Kingdom ; it enjoys the varieties of
climate resulting from a latitudinal stretch of
over thirteen degrees in the temperate zone;
its resources are immense, its soil fruitful, its
people one. With the exception of an ade-
quate population—a want which time may be
trusted to remedy—it possesses within itself
all the attributes of a great nation. Political
myopia alone could prompt its people to allow
their country’s destinies to be controlled and its
development dominated by an island nearly
thirty times its size and over a thousand miles
distant. The argument that an alliance is
necessary between England and Ireland, if only
to strengthen both and keep the smaller island
free from foreign influence, has no bearing on
the New Zealand case. The British Islands
belong to the European system —a system in
which militarism is still rampant—and are bur-
dened with the control of hundreds of millions
of subject races. There is no such predatory
future before Maoriland, no probable opening
for twenty-first century Clives or Pitts. She
is isolated, extensive, and supremely dowered,
and will have to solve for herself the problem of
how to keep inside the future Australian
national tariff and outside the Australian
National Federation. To permit any interference
in her affairs by a body far beyond her borders
would be to commit an act of national suicide.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Howl from the Bench.
Justice Richmond, of Maoriland, has sent a
letter of a more than usually grovelling
character to the Federal Convention on the
subject of an Australian Court of Appeal.
The following summary of his arguments
furnishes a forcible example of how a narrow-
minded man can reason when he looks at his
subject with one eye :
Mr. Richmond points out that as British capital is and
will continue largely to be invested in the colonies,-it is
a perfectly reasonable demand on the part of the mother
country that any British subject feeling himself aggrieved
by a decision on his civil rights of a local Court shall, if
the case be of sufficient importance, have his right of
final appeal to an Imperial tribunal. However fair
cojonial judges and juries may have shown themselves, it
is inevitable that persons resident in the United Kingdom,
or in other colonies, who should find themselves worsted
in litigation before a colonial Court, from which there
was no appeal, would in many cases both feel and express
doubt that justice had been done them, and would
be ready to impute the decision against them to local
prejudices and favour. It is to be expected that the pro-
posed measure, if carried, must have a prejudicial effect
on the financial interests of the colonies. The confidence
with which investments of all sorts are now made in Aus-
tralasia by people at home must be largely due to the
knowledge that rights of property will be dealt
wich by the Law Courts on British principles of
justice, and subject to final review by one of the
highest English Courts. It is also pointed out that it
would be, moreover, a loss to both bench and bar in the
colonies if the legal standard to which they are now sub-
mitted were removed, as in great measure it would be by
decisions in Australia being made final. As a matter of
fact, Australian Courts would be degraded by the creation
of a final appeal, as they would sink from the position of
Imperial to mere local tribunals, with corresponding con-
traction of their present jurisdiction.
There are about ten questions that naturally
arise out of this miserable outpouring, and
which Mr. Richmond certainly ought to answer:
(1) If any British subject, simply because the
local Court has not decided in his favour, even
when he is wrong, should have the right of
appeal to the Courts of his own country, is it
not rough that the French or German resident
should not be allowed to appeal to Paris or
Berlin in the same manner, when he feels
aggrieved ? (2) Suppose it is “inevitable ” that
the Englishman ‘ ‘ should feel and express doubt
that justice has been done him ” when an Aus-
tralian Court decides against him, then why in
thunder doesn’t he keep out of Australia ? (3)
Supposing the Australian in like manner should
“ feel and express doubt ” about the jus-
tice of a system which enables an Eng
lishman to drag him away to England in
order to defend his rights on a purely Australian
question—what then? (4) Seeing that the
person who loses a case always ‘ ‘ expresses
doubt ” about the justice of the decision given
against him, why should Judge Richmond or
any other judge excite himself about such a
very common matter, and how does he expect
that, even after appealing to 125 courts, he will
make both parties feel satisfied ? (5) If the
British investor won’t send his money to Aus-
tralia unless he is allowed to carry all his
grievances to an English law-court and drag
the Australian along with him, then why does
he send his beastly money to the United States,
Brazil, La Plata, Chili, Mexico, China, Japan,
Spain, and, in fact, every country on earth,
and trust the local courts of these countries ?
The harmless lunatic who washes-up in an asylum
would hardly have made such an awful exhibi-
tion of himself as Judge Richmond has done
over this argument. (6) Does Judge Richmond
seriously believe that the Australian nation
cares whether the establishment of a Federal
Court of final appeal would be “a loss
to both bench and bar,” or not; and in any case
how could it be a loss to the bench and bar ;
and supposing it were a loss to both of them
isn’t it more important that a whole nation
should be able to get justice without being
ruined in the search for it than that a close cor-
poration of birds of prey should get a few extra
pickings; and why should the people worry
about the losses of the bench and bar any more
than about the losses of the policemen and the
chimney-sweeps? (7.) If the existing Austra-
lian courts would be “degraded” by the
establishment of a Court of Appeal within the
country, are the courts of every other country,
from England right down to Montenegro, de-
graded from the same cause ; and if they are
not then, why aren’t they ; and is there no way
of preventing a court being degraded except by
making it subject to a foreign country; and if
a court is “ degraded ” by being free and inde-
pendent then isn’t a Government degraded
under the same circumstances ; and if
it isn’t, then how isn’t it, and if it is then is
Judge Richmond prepared to say that Wash-
ington, Bruce, William Tell, Bolivar,
Miranda, Palafox, and other individuals who
gained laurels in the cause of independence
were really promoting the degradation of their
respective nations ? (8) Supposing Judge Rich-
mond’s Englishman is sentenced to be hanged
by an Australian court, and should feel
“ aggrieved ” by this decision, and should
“ feel and express doubt ” about the justice of
the arrangement, why should not he also be
allowed to appeal to the Privy Council; and if
he can be hanged by the local court without
driving British capital out of the country why
shouldn’t a much smaller case concerning a few
pounds also be settled without bringing about
financial disaster ; and, moreover, why isn’t the
criminal court “degraded.” (9) Several other
questions are unavoidably held over through
wani of space.
A Wise Departure.
B. R. Wise tells the New (South Wales Free-
trade and Liberal Association that he declines
to stand for the East Sydney vacancy caused by
the death of J. R. Street, because
The questions of paramount importance at the present
time are those which affect the industrial structure or
society, and the true remedy for social discontent is far
beyond the reach of any tariff legislation. In confirma-
tion of this view, the Labour party has deliberately
rejected the policy of Protection and adopted in place ot
it the tax on land values It is, accordingly,
not necessary at the present time to fight the electoral
contest on the fiscal issue.
He goes on further to show that under “ the
fetish, freedom of contract,” so eulogised by the
capitalistic press, the condition of the British
labourer was worse than that of the galley-
slave, and asserts that—
Those who denounce the tyranny of Unionism should
never forget that the most grinding tyranny the world
has ever seen was the tyranny' of industrial anarchy.
To the often-adduced argument that unless
freedom of contract be allowed ‘ ‘ private em-
ployers cannot carry on their own businesses,’
Mr. Wise states that such a statement suggests
to him the question “ Are private employers an
industrial necessity ?” He does not answer his
own question in the negative, but does not
quite disguise his sympathies and cautiously con-
cludes a logical and careful epistle by asserting
that, “holding such views, his candidature would
not be acceptable to a constituency of employers
whose feelings are still embittered by a recollec-
tion of the late strike.” And, admitting that
he is unable to deny that ‘ ‘ the labour party is
more right in its principal contentions than the
capitalist party which is now opposing them,”
yet he thinks it advisable that a candidate should
come forward in the labour interest “ more
identified by position and past life than he has
been with those personally interested in the
demands of labour.” Congratulating Mr. Wise
on the manly and outspoken Radicalism,
nay Socialism, that pervades his letter, and
agreeing with him that the holder of
such opinions would not be a persona
grata to the clubmen of East Sydney, The
Bulletin takes this opportunity of stating that
if he (Mr. Wise) be a true champion of Labour
he is, perhaps, the only one likely to have the
slightest chance of being returned to represent
the swarming masses of East Sydney workmen,
now disfranchised through the Stock Exchange,
the clubs and the personal popularity and
landlord-power of Millionaire Mayor Burdekin.
As a correspondent wisely puts it —If Mr.
Wise, because of his sympathy with the claims
of labour, has reason to fear the opposition of
employers, how much poorer the chances of a
labour-candidate more closely identified with
the workers ? The workers have need of such
representatives as B. R. Wise —men, not
Radicals by birth, whose convictions, formed in
spite of environment, have been arrived at
after serious thought and study, and whose
public declaration is made at the cost of much
self-sacrifice, including a possible loss of friend-
ship and social status.
♦
Jury Reform.
Referee Sampson, bewailing the stupidity and
indifference of the average jury, suggests that
it would he easy to prepare lists containing
only the names of men willing to serve and
capable of serving efficiently. And then he
satirically wonders how it comes about that the
would-be jurymen—more or less “ retired ”
parties who want something to concentrate
their thoughts upon —never get summoned,
while others have to be continually bribing the
policeman not to leave his little notice. If
Sampson lived in Australia he would want to
know why influential fools, important person-
ages whose dullness is a bye-word, should be so
frequently chosen for special juries in cases
where they go into court with their decisions
already cut and dried. It is not so much that
the jury system is faulty as that the wrong
materials, or rotten materials, are too often
used in the working of it. Yet political re-
formers, who have certainly remedied a few
grand old abuses during the last fifty years,
seem afraid to enquire into that Palladium of
British Liberties, which Dickens, when still a
very young man, found to be not quite such a
glorious arrangement in practice as in theory.
The humourist scarcely exaggerated his
sketch of the juryman chemist who had
to sit through the Bardell v. Pickwick case
whilst his mind was forever wandering to the
shop, left in charge of an assistant who might
at any moment serve his best customer with
prussic acid in mistake for a toothache specific,
or something of that sort. True, the immortal
Justice Starling was responsible for that
particular outrage on the Palladium, inasmuch
as the chemist protested against serving his
country in a jury-box, instead of behind the
counter. But the absurdity of asking honest
and intelligent citizens to be wise under im-
possible conditions is as nothing compared with
the crime of leaving the administration of
justice almost entirely in the hands of a police-
man. Tlffi Law, when it hit upon the Pal-
ladium, forgot to take the possibility of human
stupidity into its calculations, and it still goes
on shutting its bleared eyes to the fact that a
person incapable of distinguishing between B
and a bull’s foot is quite eligible to sit as fore-
man of a jury. There are examinations, genuine
or otherwise, to be passed by candidates for
every branch of the public service save the
branch which is supposed to protect the com-
munity against criminal or civil wrong. And
the time seems still afar off when every juryman
will be required to produce his certificate of
common-sense and educational attainments,
granted him, at the age of 21, by a trustworthy
board of examiners. As matters stand now an
important specimen of handwriting may be
handed up for investigation by 12 good men
and true, six of whom have never learned to
scrawl. A knotty point is left to the adjudica-
tion of fellows who could never have passsd
a simple test of reasoning before a Board,
and proceed to give proof of their
mental darkness in a scandalous miscarriage
of “ Justice.” Nor does the cruellest
exhibition of idiocy disqualify these servants
of their country from repeating their little
mistakes. An contraire, seeing that jury selec-
tors work in comparatively narrow grooves, the
dangerous fool of yesterday is apt to be found
popping up again to-morrow in the same old
place. What a farce was that recent agitation
for the removal of Judge Stephen from the
English Bench whilst the jury system remains
in its present state, unprotested against by
public thinkers, and slobbered over by Car-
lyle’s millions of ‘ ‘ mostly ” who don’t think
at all. Why do professional reformers refrain
from operating upon our diseased Palladium?
In the first place, they despair of being able, as
yet, to persuade dull respectability that its
fetish is a fool. In the second place, they don’t
think of themselves as likely to ever stand in
danger of a preposterous verdict.
Merit alone, and not seniority and merit com-
bined, should be the grounds for promotion in
the Civil Service. This declaration is laid
down, not at the instance of the public servants
themselves, or of the general public whom they
serve, but solely on the initiative of the Ballarat
branch of the Australian Natives’ Association.
Now, firstly, such an alteration would open the
door to servile grovelling at the feet of senior
officials who naturally would select the most
fawning, cringing subordinates on hand when
filling vacancies. Secondly, such principles as
set forth are directly antagonistic to morality
and social progress. It is well-known that so
far as intellectual capacity is concerned the
duties of the lowest officials in the service are
quite as difficult, if not more so, than those of
the higher functionaries, and that the higher
the position the easier will be the work.
According to all ideas of rational justice it is
only fair that the younger members of society
shall bear the brunt of life’s indispensable toil,
and that in proportion as man advances inyears
and correspondingly fails in bodily and mental
vigour, so shall his labours be proportionally
lightened, till finally they are dispensed with
in toto. In these progressive times no one wishes
to dissuade the State from setting a good
example to aggressive and ignorant in-
dividualists. The A.N.A. appears to be both
aggressive and ignorant.

The Sydney Mail wants to know why Aus-
tralia hasn’t raised any pompous monument to
Captain Macarthur in recognition of the fact
that he was the “founder” of the squatting
industry in this continent. We should say
that the monument has been left out' for a good
many reasons. The bust and statue industry is
overdone, for one thing, and Macarthur was a
tolerably mean variety of skunk for another.
Moreover, the fact that a man “founded” an
industry isn’t necessarily a thing to gush about.
Macarthur brought the merino to this country
for his own profit, and if he hadn’t done it
about a hundred-thousand other men would, for
the merino is a peaceful and unwarlike animal,
and it doesn’t require any great mental or
physical vigour to bring it into any country.
There is nothing to drivel about in the circum-
stance that Macarthur was the first man who
imported it, for it is always imported into a
new country by the first man who gets a chance
to steal some grass to put it on, and Macarthur.
stole the first grass. The valour of the pro-
ceeding was nothing compared to that of the
man who imported the first consignment of
mustard ; for if his goods had happened to get
into his eye he would have suffered severely,
but nobody ever expects to be blinded by get-
ting a merino in his eye. Perhaps it has never
occurred to the Mail, either, that Australia
owes a good deal to the man who originally in-
troduced victuals into this continent, and that
if anybody deserves a statue he is the in-
dividual. If the nation is bound to make a
greater ass of itself than usual it might also
look up the brilliant genius who rose superior
to all obstacles and brought in the earliest
supply of seed Avheat, for if he hadn’t known
how to bring in wheat, or if he had failed to
keep the bag of grain in subjection, and it had
broken loose on the voyage and jumped over-
board, we might have been living on ’possum to
this very day.
—
Kaiser William of Germany is reported, in
the affecting language of a daily paper, to be
“ following in the footsteps of his father,” the
lamented Kaiser Frederick, and so far as one
man can follow with his ear in the footsteps
which another man made with his throat, this
story seems more or less probable. The
mysterious complaint in the Imperial listening
organ is now alleged to be cancer, and if so,
William’s reign is likely to be exceedingly
short; and even if it is not cancer but some-
entirely different, the fact still remains that the
Kaiser’s ear is going to bring him to grief sooner
or later. And meanwhile, it is a pleasant and
gladdening reflection that should the said ear be
so very bad some day, that William feels that he
must break something to relieve his feelings, lie
can start 2,000,000 towards France or Austria or
Russia, and make things hum by way of solace
and consolation. A monarch with a large army
and a diseased head is about as bad a tiling to
meet as a wild lion with an inflamed tail. Also
he is a darned sight more expensive ; but, then,
he is the one essential principle of monarchy,
and the human race has to put up with him.
The (Sydney Mail the other day published a
joyous little screed pointing out a “ satisfactory
increase ” of £18,355 in the month’s customs
returns at Sydney, and a decrease of £29,274
in the same department at Melbourne. There
is no accounting for Foreign-trade logic, which
is about as disconnected as a racked heretic,
but if “ Freetrade ” is steadily increasing the
customs duties at the rate of £220,000 per
annum, and Protection is reducing the sama
burden at the rate of £350,000, why doesn’t the
Mail tell the truth about its favourite policy
and admit straight out that “ Freetrade ” is
the bigger load of the two ? And, seeing that
the incoherent paper yells about the abolition
of tariffs, where does the “satisfaction” come
in when the country has to pay more in tariffs
than it ever did before ? And when the revenue
goes up, through duties being piled on by a
Government which says there shouldn’t be any
duties, why does the Mail claim the result as a
conclusive proof of the advantages of not having
duties ?

8-Ki Macquaric-street North, Sydney, April 1, 1891.
My Dkah Moor.AiiiNDA,—
N.S. W. “Royal ” Agricultural Society’s Show, at Moore
Park, on 20th nil., despite the drizzly weather in the
morning, was very well attended indeed, the crowd being
topped off by Lord and Lady Jersey. It was opened from
a dais (handsomely though heterogeneously arranged by
Wallach Bros.) by the noble Earl, who really ought to
subdue that cerulean neokscarf, and after the usual
Mumbo-Jumbo had been got through a tour of inspection
was made. In the main pavilion the big pumpkin and
the abnormal carrot reigned supreme, alternating with
jams, jellies, and preserved fruits, all decidedly tempting - ,
but whatever is the use of going in for such
things on a “dozen bottle” scale? The bottle-fruits
especially looked equal to anything we get from America,
and yet a ship-captain complained to me the other day
that he went all over Sydney one day recently for locally-
preserved fruit and simply couldn’t find any. Outside
the equestriennes were see-sawing about the ring, and,
with three brilliant exceptions, who would have adorned
any “Row,” a more wriggly lot of horsewomen I never
saw. Of the four-in-hands, I liked Mr. E. Terry’s span of
blacks with the owner for whip, dressed to kill in white
gloves and boutonniere. Mr. Arthur Allen drove his
dog-cart and pair round the ring in fine style, but the
tooler- of a very showy tandem team spoilt the effect by
letting both horses trot.
The official luncheon was served in a lolly-striped
marquee at t. 30. when an assorted throng sat down to
wrestle with fizz and the mortal remains of various
poultry. There were a number of ladies present, for the
first time in the Society’s history. Lady J. having set the
fashion that way, for which she was inaudibly blessed
by many a famished female with her mouth full of turkey.
The tables were gay with strips of crimson velvet and
bouquets of dahlias and ferns, a large wreath of dahlias
ornamenting the vice-regal board. Lady Jersey repro-
duced herself in copper silk and black wafer net, small
hat of drawn-grey gauze trimmed with mauve chiffon and
small white flowers, white fall with black beauty spot,
and carried a magnificent “ committee” bouquet in white
ferns and flowers tied with Jersey colours. Mrs. Burdekin
in a net gown of black surah trimmed with astrachan >
black velvet zouave and sleeves, small black lace and jet
bonnet with touches of pink and neckscarf of primrose
chiffon ; Mrs. Humphrey in grey figured lustre with shot-
silk sleeves, small black hat; Mrs. Dixon in cream delaine
flowered in pink ; Mrs. Alfred Allen in black corded silk
with bonnet of forget-me-nots. A good many Toreador
hats were sported.
Sydney ’Varsity matriculation exams, are safely over
for this year—the matriculatoresses numbering 42. But
I should think the glory would be dear at the price. I
know of one “pass” who used to sit up till 10 p.m. and
rise at 3 a.m. all the time she was cramming ; she refused
meanwhile all social invitations, and dieted herself on
meat-essence and milk ! If to be a successful she-grad.
meant a lamping screw in the future for the retailing of
her stock of feverishly-acquired knowledge, all little hard-
ships like the foregoing might not signify very much ;
but now-a-days the game seems hardly worth the mental
wear and tear. Most highly-educated women appear to
settle down gratefully on £BO per annum, or so-the
wages of a smart barmaid —which is deemed munificent
reward in the teaching profession, and though here and
there one meets with women who attain to decent salaries
as heads of training-schools, &c., the majority of “edu-
cated parrots ” generally find themselves engaged for the
same figure as the young lady who has never gone
through the education-mill, and whose stock-in-trade is
one part of general knowledge to three parts of kplomb.
Apropos to the exam., I am reminded of a Sydney lady
who once worked herself to passing-point, but fell in
love, married ere the fatal date, and gave up conic
sections for connubiality for ten long years. At the end
of that time the domestic virtues evidently palled upon
her, for she took to cramming again, toed the scratch as
a matron and came cut with flying colours. She was then
filled with a wild desire to gain a degree and probably
would have succeeded but that her pet tutor had a roving
eye and hubby didn’t appreciate being locked out of the
study on evenings;
Despite the depressing fact that Capt. “Chumley” was
the only ray of vice-regality visible at Randwick on the
first day of the autumn meeting of the A.J.C., in conse-
quence of which the festivities presented a rather un-
finished air, yet the dressing was good on the members’
stand, where new autumn garbings vied with the last
robes of summer. Mrs. Burdekin wore a simple chintz*
patterned dress in cream and dark crimson and green
velvet, with an elaborate white vest, made en Prlucesse.
small black I)onnet with a touch of pink at the side ; Mrs.
Forbes Angus was in blotting-paper cloth, trimmed with
cream guipure embroidery, pretty sleeves of pink cream
and blue sunset silk, black hat with pale-pink flowers ;
Mrs. Montgomerie Severn was in black rep s'. Ik with copper- 1
silk sleeves and relevements, tiny topknot en suite ;
Miss Fosbery, in lilac cambric figured in white, trimmed
with white embroidery, flat hat with lilac flowers; Carrie
Swain, fawn cloth and brown velvet, with girdle of brown
passementerie, feathered hat en suite ; Frances Saville’s
tea-dress gown of black chiffon, flowered in pink and
green, with pink and green ribbon round the front,
was just about the ugliest gown she has over worn ; Miss
Marcia Cox, in dark-green cloth made with a plain skirt
and basque bodice fastened A la vv'litaire, with dark'
green cords, dark-green Toreador hat with pom-poms en
suite ; Miss Griffith (Brisbane) looked almost 100 cool in a
blue and white striped, cambric with white silk yoke and
sleeves, hat trimmed with forget-me-nots ; Miss Simpsom
mottled pink and fawn cheviot made with plain skirt and
basque bodice, Toreador hat in brown felt with brown
and pink pom-poms ; Miss Burdekin, grey figured pongee
and silver passementerie, straw hat trimmed with cream
chiffon ; Miss Darley, in grey cloth with black velvet
sleeves and trimming of black braid, black hat of velvet
and jet; Mrs. Harry Levien, in dark-blue cloth with silk
sleeves covered with dark-blue braiding, Toreador hat
trimmed with velvet and pom-poms.
Randwick blossomed like a rose on Cup Day (30th ult )
for the gubernatorial party came out before luncheon
and tarried until pretty well the last race, and sassiety
(which had very much the same clothes on as it wore
Leger Day) felt that it had not put on its best bonnet in
vain. Lady Jersey resurrected the pink and black gown
she wore at her first reception, adding thereto a very
Caringtonian bonnet in gilt straw, black velvet and blush
roses, bright blue kid gloves and an ecru lace gamp, in
which varied turn-out her Countess-ship looked quite
kaleidoscopic ; the little Jerseys in red pongee with white
spots with pinafore bodices over red velvet and white lace
yokes, leghorn hats trimmed with cream feathers and
chiffon. A number of heavy tweed dresses were worn
(when a womai has a new autumn frock she will wear
it no matter how hot the day is), and some of
the gets-up \ ere positively wintry. The Misses
Halliday wore new gowns, the one in eocoanut
brown-cloth (mat e en basque, of course) with small brown
hat with touchet of crimson; the other in a striking
dress of electric-blue cloth covered with a sort of post-
and-rail design in black astrachan, black-and-white
hat; Mrs. Moss in silver-grey with feathered hat and
parasol en suite ; Miss Burdett Smith also in grey with
silk sleeves, grey feathered hat ; Miss Saville in figured
grey cheviot, fawn-felt hat trimmed with grey feathers
and a touch of red ; Miss Bloomfield in pale-green silk
trimmed with gold and silver guipure, black hat and
feathers. Mrs. W. Carson’s gown of dark heliotrope cloth
with lines of black astrachan trimmed with gold
passementerie, the Louis coat edged with passementerie,
hat en suite, was one of the handsomest gowns on the
lawn; Miss Garran wore dark-blue with trimming of
silk and gold passementerie, black feathered hat ; a
Melbourne visitor reproduced the gown she wore at the
Melbourne Cup, a rather screaming mixture of yellow and
lettuce-green ; Miss Burdekin appeared in grey cheviot,
black hat and feathers and tan boots, as did dozens more.
The opening of the “Juvenilities” at Sydney Exhibi-
tion Building at noon on 28th ult. was the usual cut-and-
dried ceremony. The vice-regal people, squired by
Secretary Gosohen, arrived very punctually and were
escorted to the dais by the veteran Exhibitionist Joubert.
But I must rise to ask in an agitated voice what the
Countess—the poetess-meant by her dressing on the
occasion? Imagine an ecru washing-silk, looking as if it
had passed tHrough many boilers, and trimmed with
cream guipure, topped by wide-brimmed straw hat turned
up behind and trimmed in a wet-chicken sort of way with
cream ribbons and feathers ; add to that pale-blue kid
gloves and a badly-put-on white fall, and you will have
a fair picture of the get-up. Fortunately none of the
other women present had anything on to speak of, so the
contrast wasn’t so awful as it might have been. The
feature of the opening was the setting of the vice-regal
verses (“ One People One Destiny ”) to music, which was
sung very clearly and sweetly by 500 school children,
after the National Anathema. The effect was not
artistic. Either the verses didn’t fit the music, or vice-
versa.
As the heroine in Bland Holt’s latest excitement, “The
Golden Ladder,” at Sydney Royal, Kate Bishop wears her
prettiest dress in Act 1, a white silky- gown with touches
of old gold, caught here and there with trails of yellow
roses. Miss Blanche Lewis, as a Malagese, looking well in
picturesque robes of scarlet and yellow silk with chains
of sequins. There was very little dressing in the circle
on the first night, the main feature was Mrs. Bland
Holt in cream and cardinal—she, oddly enough, has only
been in front once before to see hubby act.
There wasn’t room to wink at Her Majesty’s on Good
Friday night, the “undoubted excellence of the pro-
gramme” (as the heavy-weight reporters say) crowding
the theatre to the walls. As is the rule at “sacred”
affairs, the w’omen present were mostly in subdued walk-
ing gear, the few who turned up in turned-down frocks
wisely keeping their wraps on to avoid looking con-
spicuous. The vice-regal box was given up to a posse of
“lady delegates,” Lady Griffith, in mignonette-green
covered with black lace, and bonnet with touches of pink,
and her daughter in cream with flat hat trimmed with
flowers looking about as nice as any of them, which is
rather faint praise when you consider that one of the
party wore a voluminous white skirt, a black mantle of
forgotten shape, and a bonnet like a modified coal-
scuttle, and that another sported crimson silk gloves and
a red rose in her hat! On the stage everyone was decol-
lete. Maggie Moore wore all black ; Saville chose pure
white cap-a-pie, as she always does when she sings the
“Tannhauser,” “Prayer;” and Mrs. Vanderveer Green
(who shuffled on in what looked like a pair of bath
slippers) was in black and copper-colour.
Some fair but afflicted Sydney girl, suffering from the
very feminine calamity of knock-knees, wrote to a pon-
derous local weekly recently to be supplied with a cure.
In response—l am really narrating a fact—she was told to
“ put a pillow between her knees at night and tie her
ankles together with a pocket-handkerchief.” I hope the
girl repudiated the suggestion. Otherwise it is awful
to contemplate what might happen if the house caught
tiro.
The very latest fad is said to bo “anonymous ”,singing,
and considering how ghastly even the most beauteous
soprano looks when she is gasping after upper C, the
novelty ought to be universally adopted. At an anony-
mous concert all the songsters warble behind a screen,
and the music must be far more rapturous that way tha n
when you are forced to gaze at a short, fat woman with
red arms and a frontal tooth out singing with a fatuous
smirk and her head on one side. But unfortunately, lady
singers do not approve of this unseen idea, for to peacock
forth on to the platform, followed by a short-sighted
accompanist tripping over her train, is one of the reasons
why women like to sing in public.
The reason why the Carington-Horsfall marriage was so
long delayed was the serious illness of the bride, which
commenced in November, 1889, just on the eve of her
wedding, and she is only now thoroughly restored to
health. Those “in the know ” declare that the couple arJ
sincerely attached to one another, and that old John
Horsfall, after an acquaintance of several years with
“Brother llupert,” is almost as fond of that good-
humoured youth as of the lady who is now Rupert’s wife.
Speaking of Lady Jersey, whenever His Ex. publicly
orates in her presence her lips keep moving as if
she were dying to have the music all to herself.
Sometimes slie cannot keep silent, hut whispers hei
views into his willing ear, and then you hear hi 8
obedient echo : “ As Lady Jersey desires me to say,” &c.
—showing that in a different stratum of existence the
Noble Earl would have had to nurse the baby longest, you
bet.
Yours affectionately.

Captain Morris, late of an American seal-
poaching schooner, seized by a Russian war-ship,
narrates his Siberian-mine experiences. The
captain and four Americans of his crew —seven
Japanese hands had been killed in the seizure of
the schooner—were condemned to three years in
the mines, to which they were driven, afoot and
bound, 150 miles. Each was obliged to send up
five carloads of coal a day ere he received an
order for rations, and all were to remain below
during the term of punishment. Morris was
chained to a Polish prisoner by a waist-ring. At
the end of three months the Pole died, and for four-
days Morris worked with the corpse attached to
him, so that he could get the double rations—
thoseof the dead man as well as his own. But in
order to do this he was obliged to send up 10 loads
of coals daily. At the end of four days Morris
could stand the corpse no longer, and as he could
not break the waist-ring he cut the body in two
and sent up the halves with the ccal. The only
notice taken of this was the sending down of a
hammer and chisel so that Morris could release
the chains by which he had been bound to the
Pole. At the end of the first year Morris’s daily
task was reduced to three loads. Time passed un-
counted. One day a man descended into the
mine, being the first human being he had seen
since the death of the Po’ish prisoner. He
showed Morris a paper, and motioned to him to
enter the car. Morris refused, as he feared he
was going to be shot, this being the fate of most of
the prisoners who ascended with their loads. The
officer ascended again, but came back with an in-
terpreter, who explained that Morris’s term was
ended, and he was about to be released. Some of
the other Americans died.

“ Schoolmistress ” is the story of thodoat-
ing principal of a lady’s academy (Maggie Moore)
married to an impecunious and idiotic honorable
sponger (Dot Boucicault), who, for sake of his
family’s feelings, keeps their union secret. To
raise the needful for his little extravagances, the
instructress (unknown to the man of family pride)
consents to appear as Queen Honorine in the
comic oratorio composed by Mr. Clitberow, and,
pretending to visit a country parson, leaves the
school, and money to pay incoming bills, in the
hands of her wedded noodle, who immediately
invites a naval pal (Percy Lyndal) to supper. Now
the honorable is in the power of the governess
(Pattie Browne), one of four girls who remain at
school during the holidays. One of their number
(Emma Temple) is married to a pugnacious
young ass (Chichester) without the consent of
her pa (George Anson), an irascible, admiral,
and her ma (Miss Homer), a meek female,
who live just round the corner. In the absence of
the teacher the young couple prepare to elope, but
the girls, intending to give them a supper before
they go, force the idiot in charge to amalgamate
forces and pay “exes ” out of the “house money.”
The visitors arrive from an army and navy dinner,
and Lieut. Lyndal brings Admiral Anson,
(ridiculously made-up a< a cross between Premier
Parkes and the British Lieu) and a small sea-dog,
along, but the latter worthy fails to recognise the
locality on account of the fog, and his daughter
because he lias just returned from a lengthy cruise.
After supper the house is set on fire by the
crackers of the page, brightly played by Master
Quealy; and Queen Honorine arrives in stage
costume through the window just as the guests
leave by the fire-escape. The Admiral dis-
covers everything ; drags everyone to his
own home, where he locks up his daughter,
her husband and the honourable (made up
like a Frenchman and very quietly played
■with a broken-English, “ flannel-mouthed ”
twang by “ Boucy ”) whom he threatens to rope’s
end in the morning. The prisoners are released,
however, by Pattie Browne, and the turtle-doves
win the Admiral’s consent, principally through
the rebellion of his long clown-trodden wife. The
burnt-out Schoolmistress, offered a stage-engage-
ment at £5O a week, publicly renounces school-
teaching and becomes suddenly awake to the
selfishness, stupidity and snobbery of her bandbox
husband and the curtain falls. The play through-
out gives evidence of immaturity, lacks the finish
and sparkle of “Dandy Dick ’ and “ The Magis-
trate,” and is overloaded with allusions that are
not funny in themselves and have no bearing on
the story. The first act badly wants brightening
up and a big show is lost when Maggie Moore
neglects to give a parlour rehearsal to the
composer. Through constantly playing together,
on intelligent lines, a company may become over-
drilled, may play too much in the same key.
We do not intend to infer that this is the case at
the “Cri.,” but their harmony in the present case,
however, so emphasises the breadth of Maggie
Moore’s style that the prim habit of pedagogism
appears to sit very loosely on her. Geo. Anson,
in a very small part, is intensely funny; Pattie
Browne, a little too much in earnest; the Misses
Homer, Temple and Major, with Percy Lyndal and
Clitherow equal to small opportunities, but some
of the parts are badly cast. Master Whyte, who
plays the “middy,” is a clever lad, but ridicu-
lously under age, and some of the schoolgirlism is
too awfully bread and buttery. For the scene of
the last act, a morning-room at the Admiral’s,
Artist Churchward deserves special mention. It
is delicately grounded in light blue, picked out
in ivory and silver panels and bronze ornaments
with built-out archway and doors, and is lavishly
and harmoniously curtained and upholstered.
“ Schoolmistress ” may run for three weeks, and
it is rumoured that “The Colonel,” Burnand’s
skit on the extinct {esthetic craze, is in pr«oara-
tion.

If managers were to play 4 4 God save the
Queen ”at Easter it would draw houses. Right
through the holidays Sydney Royal circle has
been pervaded by wild, weird wooshers from vvay-
back, who laugh after the manner of the midnight
bunyip in his native swamp, in wrong places, and
tramp out and in heavily with cloven breath at
badly-chosen intervals. Mild husbands have also
been observed to pay five shillings for the privilege
of saying 44 goo-goosy ” to heavy and irritable
infants in the passage at the back of the circle,
while 44 ma” leaned over the front railing and
dropped peppermints in the stalls. Thisreminds us,
somehow, that “The Golden Ladder ’ (“ bladder”
would have been quite as appropriate) is a patch-
work play, whose scenes and situations, when good,
have been annexed by Wilson Barrett from various
sources, and then immersed in a literary poultice
of flabby Rule Britanniaism, supplied by George
R. Sims, who, for once, forgets his liver to make
all the characters talk gushingly on every possible
occasion about 44 the ’art.” As an instance of the
slush Sims ladles out, we may mention the words
put in the mouth of Peckaby, the confectioner
(cleverly played by Bland Holt, though somewhat
out of Ids line), who, reverently removing his hat
and looking up among “.the flies,” piously declares
that he has given his daughter the two best names
in the world —Victoria Alexandra. So far as
Sydney audiences are concerned he might
just as appropriately have called her “Squint-
eyed Sal,” for no one moved a finger
and not a few said 14 bosh.” There’s one
incomprehensible circumstance about modern
stage-villainy. Why does 44 the wretch” always
plot to ruin the relatives of the woman he loves?
Albert Norman must be somewhat sick of being
groaned at, Walter Howe of being virtuous. On
this occasion the latter creditably plays a parson

of militant habit, who has a great reputation
for goodness (of which he never gives any in-
stances) with a distinct aptitude for checkmating
plots against his pocket. Arthur Lawrence makes
a great deal of a very small part as Peranza, the
French adventurer. As the missionary’s wife,
Kate Bishop looks mighty good, plays with great
feeling, and does her best work of the season, but
we may remind her that it is not usual for dis-
charged prisoners to wear prison garb. As a gar-
dener, who looks like a butcher, A. G. Poulton
makes a welcome return to the stage. Messrs.
Baker (as a chaplain) and Glover (as a bank
defaulter) are, as usual, powerful, and H. Roberts
is even and correct as a French lieutenant. Flora
Anstead once more pleasingly reminds us of Eliza
Johnstone ; Virgy Vivienne (awful name) is bright
and pretty as “ Victorier Alexandrer,” and
Blanche Lewis’s sketch of “the teaser ” is credit-
able. Gordon’s scenery is very fine.

“Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,"’ holds nightly
crowded and fashionable le-re.cs at Sydney
Garrick. The piece is a Hibernian phantasma-
goria from “daybot” to “fine-alley.” “Bridget
O’Brien, Esquire, ’ is the fresh tagged name of our
old acquaintance Widdy O’Brien, nee O’Toole, and
her present mission is to teach her “son-in-law”
the respect due to her daughter. Her “shweet”
consists of a wondrous “flunkey,” whose sole
recommendation is that lie can spake Frinch so
as the widdy can undershtand him, Nora
O’Bree-on still has “on the string ” an inspired
English masher, who forms the only uninteresting
principal in the personnel. The widdy herself is
courted by Major Tiffin, aspring-kneed fire-eater,
and Benjamin Brewster, a broking sharp, and has
the divil’s own joy blarneying them both. A
garden party, given by the “ son-in-la,” is made
the medium for introducing a cosmopolitan pot
pourri into the Irish stew, the result being
neither a pantomine, nor an opera, nor a
burlesque, nor a ballet, nor a drawing-room
entertainment, but a hair of them all—and a
chignon over, of pure Sheridanesque. John F.
Sheridan takes three-parts of the cake; Gracie
Whiteford, as Nora, gets the other fourth ; and
the rest of the company divide the crumbs pro-
portionately between them. A. M. Melville
makes something of the meagre opportunities of
Mrs. Araminta Sparks, the other mother-in-law,
but is not a telling counterfoil to Bridget, Esq.,
whose creative acting and singing are sui generis.
Gracie Whiteford’s vocal efforts are most decidedly
popular. Stella Tudor, as Mrs. Richard Sparks,
yields a fair quota of amusement, and Bert Royle,
Mr. Ditto Ditto, is interesting both when cowed
and drunkenly defiant. Alfred James, as the
Major, and Henry M. Imano, as Brewster, display
considerable merit; the latter sings a baritone
love-song fairly well. Footman Alfonzo Napoleon
(John Tudor) is a gorgeous apparition with a
Seven Dials dialect. The Brothers Bovis do some
agile sand-dancing, but there is overmuch ballet
for anyone but a baldhead. “Bridget O’Brien,
Esquire,” is the,combined lunacy of F. Lyster and
John F. Sheridan. Its incidental music, very
bright, is Conductor Robertson’s; the songs are
by B. Royle, and the scenery, very pretty, is from
the brush of Lessee Wilson. The house of Easter
Monday broke the treasury record, and fairly
astounded Fred. Hiscocks, who at once (it is his
habit when much moved) burst into poetry.

At Her Majesty’s, the highly-spiced melo-
drama, “My Jack” —a maze of murder,
explosion, shipwreck, Egyptian desert, hereditary
usurpation, birth, mystery, true love, treachery,
shattered faith, high-falutin, and triumphant
virtue, spread over six acts -has been resurrected
from last year’s property-tombs and threatens to
make another “run.” The cast is the same as
formerly except in the case of Giro Panitza, the
Greek assassin and blackmailer, represented by
Frank Harcourt, rice the late Frank Stephenson,
George R'gnold’s Jack Meredith is up to
standard, and we trust that when we have been
staggering for four days over desert ridges
without a drop of water, our lungs will be as
valiant as are his and our memory somewhat
clearer. J. W. Sweeney is a real, live Pat
Doolan, with a fine roll in his gait. Harry
Jewett’s villain >s a hateful success, and he lashes
the gods into howling fury. Harcourt’s
Panitza has too much fluent English for a
Greek, though the accent is well sustained ;
his attitudinising is often bizarre, but his death-
struggles suggest careful study. A. E, Green-
away, as Charles Prescott, the repentant escapee,
is crushed with woe by the author and dies early
in the evening, unmourned by the audience. Mrs.
George Rignold is dramatically impressive as
blind Mrs. Prescott; and Miss Watts-Phillips
holds public sympathy and admiration on account
of her graceful endurances of stage-sufferings.
Madge Seymour is a scrumptious and lively
publicaness. The other parts are suitably allotted
and the infliction is livened up by nautical songs
and dances, and stray (very stray) references to
“Old England’s flag,” which excite, however,
no audibly responsive chords in the breasts of the
audiences. In fact, “My Jack ” owes its success
to its lurid spectacularity of scenery ; the memory
of which is a nightmare of sulphurous sunsets—
of green, smoky, “serrated ” seas, of Libyan caves
and rocky defiles. This marrow-freezing, melo-
dramatic mush -to be continued till further
orders.

The Good Friday Night concert at Her
Majesty’s, taken all round, was a success. Maggie
Moore did not paralyse folks with her “ Ave
Maria,” by Luzzi, nor were Mme. Vanderveer-
Greene’s soli eventful ; but Frances Saville,
despite a slight tendency to be nasal in the prayer
from “Tannhauser,” touched nothing that she did
not adorn. Neither Mr. W. Walshe (his benefit
is on April Bth) nor Mons. Deslouis were in very
good voice, and after the items sung by our
departing prima-donna the events of the evening
were the “God is a Spirit” quartette and the
duet, “Quis est Homo,” by Frances Saville and
Vanderveer-Greene. Mons. Kowalski played
excellently, forsaking his own method once for the
Halle style, and was encored liberally. For the
last recall he played the “ Swanee River,” when a
smile went round among those who deemed such
an item out of place at a “ sacred ” concert. Now,
the “ Swanee River,” endeared by holy and
tender associations, is just as “sacred ” and,
perhaps, as elevating as any melody may be,

Doctor Carver’s “Wild America” skips
from Sydney after Saturday, 4th April, after a
very successful nine weeks’ season. During the
week the horses and bullocks have been given
away_ to ticket-holders, and fresh novelties are
promised for the concluding days. The genial 1
“ Joe ” Brown has gone in advance to arrange for
appearances in Goulburn on Monday and Tuesday,
and Albury later on. The combination opens at
Melbourne Friendly Societies’ Gardens on Satur-
day, 11th April, and, on the close of season there,
returns to Sydney, win nee they ship to ’Frisco,
having gone, since leaving America, completely
round the world and right through the pockets of
every community on their track.

“Moths,” as produced upon the large
stage of Melbourne Royal, is a handsome, com-
forting entertainment—quite a dream of drowsy
garden scenery, gorgeous interiors, graceful
femininity and gilded sin. Artist Brunton has
supplied Ouida’s naughtiness with backgrounds
worthy of that gifted creature’s florid imagination,
and the nobility have here a wider sweep for their
misbehaviour than they enjoyed at Sydney
Garrick. Generally speaking, a sassiety story,
especially one which is mostly told in the drawing-
room, is best adapted to a small theatre, but
seeing that “Moths” deals with princes and
palaces, and suchlike large institutions, it pro-
bably requires as much space as the management
can give it. One has to discuss an intoxicating
quantity of blue-blood in the course of the evening,
for everybody belongs by birth or marriage to the
first families, with the exception of a casual Polish
serf, whose appearance on the programme suggests
a frost-bitten weed thrown into a hothouse full of
exotics. Even Correze, the opera-singer, is a
markee of long descent, with a topnote that he
can trace back to Noah. The general air of
bon ton is infectious, and_ at the end of the
fourth act, a humble critic walks languidly
downstairs, under a sort of impression that
he’s a duke in his own right. This im-
pression lingers around his mind until he
wants to “spout” his coronet and finds it isn’t
there. Then he remembers that he hasn’t an
ancestor who came over with the Conqueror, but
finds consolation in the thought that he neither
maltreats his own wife nor carries on with some-
body else’s —presuming he be the virtuous em-
ploye of a good paper. The fault with “ Moths ”
is perhaps not so much the superfluity of talk as
that it is always being talked by the same lot of
people, forever talking in the same keys. An
aristocratic sameness seems to prevail. Neverthe-
less, the end of the third act is so continuously
strong and wonderfully wicked that many attend-
ances equal to the moderate crowd of Saturday
night might be expected if Fortune were not
frowning on the old house. The cast is much the
same as that seen in Sydney. Miss Olga Nether-
sole plays the heroine again in an interesting,
powerful manner, carrying her head askew as
usual, and repeating Charles Warner’s tricks of
voice. Correze is Cautley as ever, and Charles
Cartwright repeats his badly-tailored concep-
tion of the Russian prince, being especially
artistic in his curt remarks. Sass, too, is
the lord who feels sorry that his relations
with giddy Lady Dolly prevent him from
offering a virgin heart to her daughter, and Hans
Phillips renews his heroic struggle to simulate a
live duke. Also Miss Watt-Tanner continues to
support the dignity of her old position ; ditto
Miss Emma Gwynne, who, by the way, does her
level best to appear youngep than her daughter.
Half-a-dozen violent dabs with the powder-puff
and two streaks of paint might easily disguise the
early bloom of this pretty little lady, and she
must remember that the part requires her to con-
ceal . the ravages of time, sal volatile and
cigarettes, even though she hasn’t any ravages to
fill in with chalk. All the same, Miss Gwynne’s
suggestion of Lady Dolly is the best work she has
done in Melbourne. Her remorseful croak, as she
hurries off after receiving her child’s well-bred
cuss, is worthy of the occasion, and her
inability to stand up straight is just what
one might expect of such an unmistakably
“cronk ” character. The Misses Maud William-
son and Mary Kingsley are new to their parts.
The former looks, sneers, and acts De Sonnaz
with striking effect, whilst Miss Kingsley is just
delightful as Fuchsia Leach, you bet! True, her
’Murrikan accent is intermittent, but she’s real
smart all the time. In fact, Fuchsia’s a daisy.

No Easter change was necessary at the
Princess’, where little “Pepita ”and her minute
foster-sister keep up a steady pitter-patter to sub-
stantial business. Leumane’s strange outburst of
funniness comes as the only remarkable revelation
in this revival. His comicality staggers - almost
stuns—a public who never imagined he could have
so much joke in him, and the highest possible
compliment to his performance is a nightly ex-
pression of opinion that Williamson and Garner
have been loading him up with ginger-ale. This
may be mentioned without offence, because Leu-
mane is about as near to a teetotaller as an
operatic tenor can get, and his present high spirits
are distilled from soft tack.
* * * *
The only Elton takes a farewell benefit at
the Princess’ to-morrow (April 3rd), when, by
way of obviating any possibility of an unpacked
house, “Charity Begins at Home” will follow
“Pepita.” This somehow reminds us that the
title of Cellier’s operetta is not well adapted to a
theatrical benefit—
The new season at Melbourne Opera House
opened with a bang on Saturday night. Two
previous productions of “ Falka ” on the same
boards have not impaired the drawing powers of
an opera which is well made and harmonious,
rather than flimsy and jingling. It was, perhaps,
better liked on Saturday by an audience familiar
with the work than on the original first night,
when Robert Brough, Yerdi, Kelly, Appleby,
Miss Ivanova, and Minna Fischer, put it through.
The music has a tendency to grow upon unprofes-
sional ears, whilst the story, constructed on the
neatest French lines, doesn’t become tiresome.
In fact, folks appeared to swallow ‘ ‘ Falka ” as
though—like Lay Brother Pelican —they wanted
it badly. Certainly the show has never been
more liberally served in the matter of scenic and
leg effects, or orchestra, which may be ex-
pected to lose all roughness in a little while.
This remark applies only to the brass
instruments, and not to the legs, whose
soft, silken appearance is very soothing.
Miss Clara Merivale scores an unpretentious suc-
cess in the name part. Although somewhat small
in voice and style she is a piquante representative
of the convent schoolgirl, and quite a tender little
poem in tights or skirts. Snazelle (a pictorial
reminiscence of his Devilshoof in the old Carl
Rosa times) is sufficiently tremendous as Captain
Boleslas, the knife-girt brigand whose every scowl
is a mortal thrust through the liver, and whose
remorseless ha ! ha ! might send an elephant into
convulsions. For an interpolated song he fetched
a double encore on Saturday. Fanny Liddiard
also makes a nice, brown, bloodthirsty kind of
Miss Boleslas, and the higher civilisation of lovely
woman is prettily illustrated by Aggie Kelton and
other angels. John Forde seems a lot funnier
and more filling as Governor Falbaek than the
governors one meets outside of fiction, and the
unthankful tenor part of Arthur is not worse
than usually done by one Arthur Salvini,
a tuneful amateur with an Irish face
that accounts for his name. There are
mosquitoes to be dropped in all this ointment,
however. Knight Aston overfools the part of
Brother Pelican, which Kelly made so quaint, and
as much may be said against John Gourlay’s per-
formance of the juggins Tancred. It is panto-
mimic and out of the picture. The whitened face
and almost perpendicular eyebrows stamp Tancred
with the clown’s trade-mark and his antics har-
monise with his too ridiculous get-up. Seeing
that Forde once played the part cleverly, and that
Gourlay could make a Ealbach after the fashion of
his potentate in “Paul Jones,” these two actors
might do worse than work a coup d'exchange. This
is a French idiom invented for the occasion.

At the Alexandra there was a red-hot
welcome for “All for Gold,” on Saturday, the
older people being especially glad to see Dampier
once again as the faithful soldier who brings two
little girls into their property and sets the soul of
the Wandering Jew at rest. The drama—in
which Mabel Russell and May Renno have suc-
ceeded the Lily and Rose Dampier of yore—will
keep things moving for six nights. Then
“ Belphegor,” another _ revered memory of the
past.
* * * *■
Also another change, that is not likely to
make much practical difference, took place at
Melbourne Bijou on Saturday. “ Forget-Me-
Not,” poor, little faded flower ! dropped fairly to
pieces during last week, and “ Masks and Faces ”
is now what advertisements would call the reign-
ing attraction. Charles Reade’s out-of-date
comedy can scarcely be expected to reign much,
for the inaugural ceremony was a sad and solemn
affair, marked by all the premonitory symptoms
of early dissolution. Nothing, save the simple,
but artistic, mounting, came up to the expecta-
tions of a Bijou audience, so a yard of critical
comment upon the ins-and-outs (mostly outs) of
the entertainment may be condensed into a
pithy observation that it won’t do. Miss
Achurch, in a traditional “ star ” character
like Peg Woffington, challenges comparison
with actresses who were favourites with the
whole body politic. She, not being a favourite of
that species in Melbourne, is unable to throw the
necessary glamour around a show which is dis-
tinctly moderate to the undazzled eye. The
colourless, mechanical Triplet of Charles Char-
rington, and Mrs. Vane of Miss Bronton, are
almost as irritating as Eille Norwood’s funereal
notion of Sir Charles Pomander. Only two or
three of the occasional apparitions, such as George
Leitoh, are really convincing. All the customary
snap has departed from matters at the Bijou since
the Achureh-Charrington Company came along.
And, seeing how strong the opposition is just now,
the Government had better go in for a violent
change of policy on receipt of this friendly
intimation.

The Victoria Hall crowd enjoyed a regular
howler of an Easter Saturday, likewise the Gaiety
nearly exploded with bucolic glee. Slade Murray
is about to visit the latter sanctuary for the abso-
lutely last time, and when his brief engagement
has terminated the voice of Good Old Mary Ann
will be heard no more. She has proved herself a
useful, profitable female, and it’s little wonder
that Tummy is very fond of her. The Waxworks
has struck it rich with a pugilistic kangaroo, who
fights his trainer to a finish with full-sized gloves,
and never descends to a barney. He fights to
win, does the Waxworks kangaroo, and if he
didn’t always get the verdict “on points,” he’d
just about'break his mighty heart. An ordinary
human boxer never breaks anything now-a-clays,
except his confiding backers. A People’s Palace,
under parsonic and much elderly maiden-aunt
patr nage, was to be opened at the Exhibition last
Monday, by the Governor in person. The
Governor out of person would be no good for a
task of that description. Other shows as
usual, and Madame Liebe at the Town Hall
occasionally.

On Saturday (4th) a matinee performance
is to be given at the Bijou for the benefit of a
blind girl who wishes to educate herself in the law
or medical profession or something. The aspira-
tions of this plucky and studious young lady are
naturally attracting a quantity of gushing
sympathy to her case, but when the benefit has
brought in its hundreds some calm, sober
individual ought to step forward and advise the
recipient to stick to her money instead of laying
it out in dead languages and elderly professors.

Avon Saxon, remembered here as the baritone in Amy

From report of Sydney amateur entertainment: “ Mr.

A bush visitor to Melbourne, the other day, bought two
Bijou stall-tickets. On one seat he sat, and on the next
he coiled his dog. Ejected by the police, his defence was
wrathful—" I (picturesquely) paid for two (terra-cotta)
tickets, one fur me an’ one fur Jim. Jim’s alius close ter
me, an’ I hainter goin’ ter be parted from him fur any
(marigold) man. Jim’s a (scarlet) sight better dorg than
any (bally) bloke yere.” Fined £2 for creating a dis-
turbance, and drifted away murmuring—“Fust (cherry)

(carmine) cunsterble he (muddy well) meets.”
A Press cablegram states that the young Duke of
Orleans—an enormously wealthy man, by the way—is
now, or has been, acting as valet to Madame Melba, the
now celebrated Australian cantntrice. This statement is
given on the authority of the Pall Mall Gazette, but
the Times has contradicted the rumour and stated that
the Duke is at Tiflis in Asia Minor. The story about the
Duke’s admiration for Madame Melba is now rather old
to the general public, though, if he has been acting as
one of Maclaine's lacqueys, it is plain that she can have
known nothing of it. Many weeks ago a paragraph
appeared in many London papers, including Lloyd’s, to
the effect that the Duke of Orleans was madly in love
with the fair Australian and had followed her from
Brussels to London and thence to St. Petersburg. A
later cable states that the rumour arose from the resem-
blance borne by the valet, who accompanied Melba to the
Paris railway depot when she saw Hubby Armstrong off
to Australia, to Orleans.
What does Mayor Burdekin mean to do with Sydney’s
leviathan organ? He has actually refused the use of it
to an alleged famous French organist, Mens. A. Guil-
mant, for a series of recitals. The argument that these
recitals would seriously affect the success of Mons. Wie-
gand’s engagement is not to be entertained. Sydney’s
organ was not put up, or should not have been put up, as
a matter of speculation, but as a source of public plea-
sure—a refining influence—and the people of Sydney
should, therefore, be allowed every opportunity of hear-
ing the best talent available, if Guilmant be a more
accomplished organist than Wiegand, so much the worse
for Sydney, but the latter’s value will not be increased by
precluding the former from playing. The question seems
to have been studied from the standpoint of the huckster.
Highly creditable is this Bijou Melbourne benefit for
Miss Aston, the brave, blind University student. The
Austral Salon really does something sensible for once.
Madame Simonsen, as previously stated, will have a
special eye to Wagnerian opera. The masterpieces of the
four operas on Nibelungen have never been heard in
Australia, with “Siegfried,” “ Walkyre,” “Tannhauser,”
“Parsifal,” “Der liheingold,” “Tristan and Isolde,”
and all those works, though the plebiscites for the Vic-
torian Orchestra showed this music to he more popular
than any.
After eight years absence Gracie Plaisted has returned

The Story of the Grey Kangaroo.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Did you ever hear about the grey kangaroo on
Mount Sheldrake ? ” said Dick, as we all lounged
about on the verandah after a hard day’s mustering.
“ No, go ahead,” said the boss, “I want some-
thing to send me off comfortably to sleep.”
“ Well, most fellows put it down as a yarn, but
I know it’s true, for I was on the place and saw
the kangaroo often, and had reason to know
it”
“ Here ! make a start, don’t be so long-winded,”
said one of his audience.
“ This grey kangaroo used to be seen on all parts
of Mount Sheldrake run, and all the old hands
firmly believed that it was not a real flesh-
and-blood kangaroo, but an evil spirit. One
ttili'g was certain, some accident always happened
to a man after he had seen the grey kangaroo for
the first time. If you got well out of that you
were right, and might see it ever so many times
afterwards without coming to grief. I got a spill
and broke my collarbone the first time I ever made
its acquaintance, but everybody did not come off
so lightly. Young Jack O’Grady chased it the
first time he saw it, and rode into a wire-fence and
broke his neck ; and the day before Mrs. Camp-
bell, the manager’s wife, died, it hopped right up to
the station and looked in on the verandah. And
every dog on the place tucked its tail between
its legs and hid itself away. I saw that myself;”
here there was a short chorus of grunts.
“It was a great, big beast, grey all over, and
difficult to see until it was right on top of you,
staring at you with its short-sighted eyes. As for
shooting it our best shots tried many a time, but
they always missed, nobody could tell why.
“One evening I was coming home empty-handed
from a long hunt I had had after some lost horses,
when my nag knocked up. There was an old aban-
doned sheep-station, with a hut, and the remains
of a yard about ten miles from the head station,
and I made up my mind to camp there for the
night. It was dark when I got there, and I hob-
bled my horse out and went inside to make a fire.
While I was ‘busy at the job I heard my horse
galloping away in his hobbles, although he was
that done when 1 got off him that I thought every
minute he was going to lie down with me. I ran
to the door, and sure enough you couldn’t see his
heels for smoke-there, coolly nibbling away at
some pigweed where the old yard had been, was the
grey kangaroo. I was so mad I up with a big
stone and let drive at him, and blessed if I didn’t
hit him fair in the ribs; then I ran after my horse,
but just as I was catching him up he broke his
hobbles, and away he went for home, as hard as
he could lick. I gave it up as a bad job and
went back to the hut. By this time it was dark,
and when I entered the door what was my astonish-
ment to see an old white-haired and white-bearded
man sitting by the fire on one of the rough stools.
“Your horse got away ? ” he said as cool as a
cucumber.
“ Yes,” confound him ! ” I replied, “but where
did you spring from ? ”
“ I was just coming up when you started.”
“ Where’s your swag? ” I asked.
“ Why, to tell the truth,” he said, “ I’m in the
same fix as you, my horse cleared out this morn-
ing, and I have been walking all day looking for
him. I was going back to my camp, about a mile
from here, when I saw you in the distance and
came up here.”
I wasn’t sorry to see him, for the sake of com-
pany, and we shared what little grub I had with
me and a pot of tea. Then we lit our pipes and
fell to yarning.
“There’s a queer story connected with this hut,”
said the old man after a bit. “ I suppose you'
never heard of it ?”
• “No,” I said.
“Ah ! it was some time ago, in old Hardcastle’s
time. There were sheep here then. The shepherd
out here was a married man—an old fellow mar-
ried to a young girl. How he came to marry her
is a queer story, too. Seems the old man had
saved up a tidy bit of coin, and he went back to
his own part of Australia meaning to settle down
there. Well, he found an old friend therewith
whom he had been brought up as a boy—regular
chums they had been. This man was a widower
with a daughter as pretty as a picture, and the
old fool fell in love with her straight off. The
girl’s father was awfully hard-up, and couldn’t
pay up on his selection, so the old fellow lent him
the needful, and then a little more, and a little
more, until finally he married the girl and found
himself pretty well broke at the same time. He
returned here where he was sure of a job and
came to live at this hut. I’ve no doubt it
was lovely for the girl, more especially as they
had no children. As time went on the kangaroos
got awful bad, and the Board put a price on their
scalps. A lot of fellows took to kangaroo-shooting
and did well at it. Amongst others there came to
the district a young fellow who hailed from near
the same part as the old shepherd’s wife, and
seemed to know a little about her people.
Of course it was the hackneyed story, he made
his camp only half-a-mile from the sheep-station,
and the lovers met pretty often in the old man’s
absence. The husband, who was fond of his wife,
before very long noticed her changed manner, and
one thing and another caused him to suspect them.
One afternoon he left his sheep and came home.
There was no one in the hut, and no one in sight,
but on the table was a sporting Snider rifle that
he knew belonged to the kangaroo-scalper. There
was a belt of cartridges, too, and the old man
picked it up and put it on quite mechanically ;
then he took the rifle and walked out just as
though he knew what was coming.
You know the ridge just at the back? —well, he
went round the foot of that, andJamet them
coming round the other side, about 50 yards off.
I’ll say that for the young fellow, that as soon
as he saw the old man with the rifle and knew it
was all up, for his arm was round her waist, the
first thing he thought of was to get in front of the
girl and shelter her. And she was just as eager to
protect him from the bullet they both knew they
deserved. So they struggled together, and the
old man he laughed like anything. They had
made a fool of him, and now he was making fools
of them. He was right, wasn’t he !
By-and-bye the young man sings out : “ Why
don’t you fire, you old cur?”
Now, do you know that old fool was just think-
ing whether, after all, the best thing to do was to
blow his own brains out, and let the poor young
things be happy ; but when the young fellow said
that, he couldn’t help himself, but he up with the
rifle and fired, ahd down went the young fellow
with the bullet from his own rifle right through
him.
As for the girl, she knelt by the side of the body
and begged and prayed to him to shoot her, too.
But he wouldn’t. He left her there, and walked
back to the hut, and there everything looked so
lonely and awful that he did what he had been
thinking about doing before. He went and sat on
that log outside there, touched off the trigger of
the rifle with a stick, and blew his brains out.”
“ And what became of the girl ?” I asked.
“ Ah, I don’t know ; she had the sudden deaths
of two men on her soul, so I don’t suppose she was
happy. Now, young man, I’m going to turn in on
these bags. I got a nasty fall in the creek and
came r ight down on a rook and hurt my ribs.
And without more ado the old fellow lay down
on the bags.
“ And has that grey kangaroo that haunts the
station anything to do with this yarn ?” I asked.
“What kangaroo?” said the old man, starting
up quite viciously. “There’s no such thing as a
grey kangaroo on the station ; don’t you believe
rt. ”
“But I’ve seen it,” I persisted.
“Not you,” said the old fellow; “there’s no
such thing—just you go to sleep.” And not
another won! would he say.

being drunk and hasting the old

Prisoner: “Yer Worchip, for soshal

I was dog-tired, for I had had a long day, and
slept like a top—it was sunrise before I awoke.
The old man was gone and I saw no sign of him,
but as I started to walk home I saw the grey kan-
garoo feeding about on the site of the old sheep-
yard.”
G. D. Carter, M.L.A. for part of Mel-
bourne, declares there are only six or eight men in
the Victorian Assembly of 95 who do not “ sacri-
fice their pi-inciples ” at the very first temptation.
In other words, the average member, like Wal-
pole’s “ every man,” has his price.
Torrid Brisbane and frigid Christchurch
are agitating for the State establishment of homes

An East Orange (N.S.W.) alderman refuses
to sign a joint bond for the borough’s overdraft,
because he only owns a “shanty in Summer-street,
part of which belongs to my partner, and some
old clothes.” This dissipates the libel that East
Orange aldermen never possess more than one pair
of pants apiece.
“Allegro” tells a story in the Queens-
lander about a shepherd whose flocks got
“boxed” during a terrible storm. “What did
you do?” asked a man to whom he afterwards
narrated his troubles. “ I just prayed.” “ What
form of prayer did you use ?” “ Couldn’t remem-
ber any set form, so I said—' O Lord, if you’re
still in the miracle line, you’ll never get a better
slant than this.’” Which reminds us of the
brother chestnut about a shepherd who, after a
visit to “the township,” was found one morning
groaning on his knees. His soul outpoured itself
thus—“0 Lord, thou knowest all things; help
me to find that holler log where I planted the
bottle of rum larst night so’s Bucky Joe shouldn’t
find it, for I forget the ezact place, Lord.”
Conditions matter not
(It is a story old),
Seme drink because it’s hot,
And others ’cos it’s cold.
No matter what they blame,
They get there just the same.
Spontaneous Combustion.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I came to Sydney to reform. Matthew Burnett,
the Temperance firebrand, converted me (for the
117th time) last year in Melbourne, but lie having
left for England to recruit his health, “ the boys ”
re-recruited me into Bohemia, and I kept back-
sliding from grace until, fired with high resolve, I
determined to change the venue and mortice
myself in an entirely new—teetotally new, I might
say—set of acquaintances. I succeeded beyond
my wildest hopes.
I presented my Burnett credentials to Rev.
James Wormington, who welcomed me as “ a
bright example of saving grace,” and introduced
me to Secretary Joseph Dubbledoo, of the Anchor
of Safety Lodge of the Noble Order of Go-the-
Back-Way-Ins, who also received me with fervour
and was my sponsor to several fair Sisters of the
Brotherhood.
I speedily became a Shining Light, used to
speak at open-air and hall meetings on the curse
of drink and the blessings of Gospel Temperance,
conducted a Sisters’ Bible Class on Wednesday
evenings, a Brothers’ Experience Meeting on
Friday evenings, and taught a mixed class at
Sunday school every Sabbath morning and after-
noon, besides performing at some allotted mission
work on Sabbath evenings. I also joined the
mission choir, but was rejected because the
harmonium couldn’t keep time with me. In spite
of this melancholy set-back, however, I believe I
would shortly have got a billet as a bank cashier,
but for the unfortunate incident which I am now
about to relate.
I was very popular with our Sisterhood. I was
always reckoned upon as a certainty in any
emergency of unseemly levity, to check at once,
by a grave and ponderous discourse, the rising
worldly spirits of the young and giddy, and I
was particularly happy in impromptu efforts at
frightening “seven-bells ” out of the most hardened
boozers, by vivid descriptions of the torments of
a drunkard’s hell, both in the earthly fantods and
the after-death eternal drought. It was a common
thing for me to harrow a trembling sly-drunkard
into jumping horrors, and bring him to the
penitents’ form in delirious fear. Thus many souls
were more or less saved, and I became an indis-
pensable leader at every function.
The Sisters got up a dramatic entertainment as
a highly moral lesson—“ The Trial of John Barley-
corn.” I was a prominent performer and stage-
manager., It was one grand success, and the
shocking examples that “took the pledge” that
evening were very numerous. Having so much to
do with the stage business, I was excused from
my usual secretarial duties of issuing pledge-cards
and receiving subscriptions,
I was swellishly attired for the occasion in a
long-discarded dress-suit. And, alas ! that piece
of personal vanity was the means of my undoing.
This dress-suit had been at the bottom of an old
portmanteau, and when, earlier in the evening I
had drawn it forth tenderly from its hiding-place,
I saw that it was covered with the tell-tale stains
and grease-spots of old-time Queensland orgies.
I had hardly time to sponge it thoroughly with
benzine and hastily don it, when it was time for
me to repair to the function.
Miss Virtue Sippolyte was a buxom, heavy-eyed
nymph of frigidity, quite 30 wet seasons old.
Nevertheless, she was to my taste —an acquired
taste, I may remark. No breath of scandal had
ever turned a hair of her solidly-set head. And
her ma, a widow, had informed me that the dear,
innocent girl had £3OO a year in her own right. I
had commented on marriage to Miss Virtue, and I
found that her ideas coincided with my own. Her
ma had smiled on our suit, and was once good
enough to prophesy that I would be “a great
power for good if I didn’t backslide.” I had
soothed her qualms on that point, and I intended
on this night to dare rny fate. Now you under
stand why I wore the dress-suit.
It was after the dramatic performance. I had
courageously coaxed Miss Virtue into a back ante-
room, the gas in which had not been lighted. I
will draw a delicate veil over the sacredness of
that dark seance. Love is holy. Suffice to say
that Miss Virtue had referred me to her ma.
I had just imprinted a chaste kiss on Miss
Virtue’s composition lips, when the door opened
and in its streaming light stood Dame Sippolyte
and three Dowager Sisters of the Higher Com-
mittee. They could not see us in the dark,
whereas we could plainly discern them.
Ar ® y° u there, Virtue?” fairly shrieked her
ma. “They said she hentered ’ere,” she said
aside.
“ Ma. Only me and Brother Dipso ”
“In the dark!” yelled the matron, “Won’t
someone light the gas ?”
(( *‘ a minute, dear madam,” I said, hurriedly.
I’m feeling for the matches.”
I was flurried. I drew a lucifer from a vest
pocket and incautiously ignited it in the free old
Queensland style—
there was a burst of flame from hip to knee- —
an ungodly remark from myself, as I suffocated
the rising conflagration—and shrieks from the
women.
I liad forgotten that my pants were benzined !
The ante-room was rushed by Brothers and
Sisters, and they all saw my singed flesh and my
ripped pants.
“You disgraceful villain !” screamed Mrs. Sip-
polyte; “you bold, bad man! Virtue, come to
me.”
Miss Virtue, my affianced bride, gave me one
look of dull, heavy scorn and deserted me in my
distress.
“Brothers and sisters,” said the Rev. James
Wormington (who himself had his eye on the
faded girl with £3OO a year), “mysterious are the
ways of Providence and the paths of sinners arc
full of pitfalls. Hypocrisy is always unveiled by
the hand of Heaven. In the midst of his
wickedness, in the hey-day of his triumphant
dissembling, the deceiver is unmasked. Behold
that wolf in sheep’s-clothing whom we have
called Brother Dipso. The Old Adam was evi-
dently rampant in him all the while he professed
to have put on the new. But Heaven has taken
the scales from our eyes. Heaven ordained that
the spirituous liquors which this confused wretch
imbibed daily—nay, hourly, it may be—oozed out
of him and permeated his perspiration, yt a, even
his very clothing. The simple ignition of a match
has set fire to his alcoholically-drenched garments.
Go, base hypocrite, go forth from the fold and
seek humbly in private if there is forgiveness for
your crimes. Go your ways, ungodly man, and
beware”—here he positively foamed—“beware
spontaneous combustion ! ”
I went.
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Keep Good Company.
Keep good company or none. Never be idle,
it your hands can’t be usefully employed, attend
to the cultivation of your mind. Always tell the
truth. Make few promises. Live up to your
engagements. Keep your own secrets if you have
any. When you speak to a person, look him in
the face. Good company and conversation are
the very sinews of virtue. Good character is
above all things else. Your character cannot be
essentially injured except by your own acts. If
anyone spea‘k evil of you let your life be so that
none will believe him. Drink no kind of intoxi-
cating liquors. Ever live (misfortune accepted)
within your income. When you retire to bed,
think over what you have been doing during the
day. Make no haste to get rich if you would
prosper. Small and steady gains give compTtncy
with a tranquil mind. Never play at any game
of chance. Avoid temptation, through fear you
may not withstand it. Earn money before you
spend it. Never run in debt unless you see a way
to get out again. Never borrow if you can pos-
sibly avoid ii. Do not marry unless you are able
to support a wife. Don’t overfeed, but look after
your health. Avoid late hours and dissipation,
always beware of the first signs of approaching
sickness. Never neglect a simple headache as it
is a symptom that the liver and stomach are
deranged, and may lead to chronic disease if
neglected. If you find your daily avocati in
trouble to you, that you get flushings of ieat,
nervous depression or neuralgia, you can saj with
truth that your system is run down and til ,t the
only way to overcome such trouble is to ake a
course of Clements Tonic, the only natural flood,
nerve and brain restorative extant. Cl ments
Tonic tones the stomach, aids digestion, in proves
the appetite, forms blood, bone and : nusele,
and ensures regular performance of all lil fls pro-
cesses, thus warding off disease. W. D. 1 Iraham
(senior partner Braharn and Mutch), the crack
tailor and cyclist’s outfitter, 75 King-stre it, Syd-
ney, ran his strength out completely by ( xcessive
attention to business ; his own words describe his
case b-st. He says “Dear Sir,—Kindly send
me two more bottles of Clements Tonic and per-
mit me to express my thanks and gratitude at the
results obtained by taking two large bottles. I
have had a great amount of business worry to con-
tend against, which together with the long hours
I had stuck to it, completely undermined my con-
stitution, and made me feel very tired, weak and
ill, my nerves being quite shattered. I was so
nervous that the accidental slamming of a door
would cause me to start violently, my heart would
beat very rapidly, and I would break out in a pro-
fuse perspiration, afterwards having a sensation
of extreme weakness, lasting for some hours; my
sleep at night was disturbed ; I woke up in the
morning with headache and aching limbs, and
quite unrefreshed. I had no appetite, no strength,
and no inclination to work, and was completely
run out. I was persuaded by your advertisements
to try Clements Tonic, and am a different man
ever since. It gave me new health and strength,
increased my appetite and made me relish my
food ; I increased in flesh, I lost all nervous feel-
ings, and now feel stronger than ever, and am
glad to bear testimony to the value of your
wonderful remedy.”

He spent £fioo in a fortnight at one London hotel.
City rumour and the N.S.W. country
press correspondence aver that several big Sydney
merchants are standing on the precipice-line of
insolvency and must topple over disastrously very
soon.
General Joe Johnston is dead at last.
Unlike Jeff. Davis, he retained no rankle, but
cheerfully accepted the Glorious Union, and was
most friendly with his old antagonist, Uncle Billy
Sherman.
The imprint of Melbourne Aub now reads ;
“Printed and published by the proprietor, David
Syme.” The “Co.” has therefore disappeared
and the Age has “One Person, One Policy”—
zigzag as before.
Dr. Warren, of Orange (N.S. W.), who
died recently in England was, in 1853, said to be
the handsomest man in London, his rivals being
Mario, the singer, and Count D’Orsay, Lady
Blessington’s friend.
A paragraph setting forth Tennyson’s love
of good old wine is going round the press. We
now want to hear about the poet who loves good
old lemonade —and yet makes enough out of his
rhymes to buy sherry.
A certain Sydney magnate is understood
to aver that he will be in a position to give bis
daughter half-a-rnillion on her marriage-day.
However, he is not yet understood to say that he
will part to that extent.
F. 0. B. Vosper, of Charters Towers, dis-
claims having “ now ” anything to do with the
financial or literary conduct of the Republican,
but assumes that, “as trustee,” he is “legally
responsible for its contents. ”
Lord Deramore, who has purchased the
Renmark (S.A.) irrigation colony from Chaffey
Bros., was originally an officer in the 13th
Dragoons, and represented Londonderry in the
House of Commons when plain Thomas Bateson.
The Hawk apparently considers the card-
cheating accusation against Sir William Gordon-
Cuimning proven, and asks what he is going
to do against the sworn evidence of five persons,
and his own signed promise, which practically
amounts to an admission of guilt.
Silver King millionaire Mackay lately gave
Melbourne Public Library a full set (40 volumes)
of Bancroft’s American histories, morocco-bound,
a parallel gift to Napoleon the Third’s of the
complete volumes of the Moniteur, contemporary
record of the great French Revolution.
Dr. Lauterer (Q.), an enthusiastic linguist,
says that the question, “ Is the girl hungry?” in
his alleged (and discredited) aboriginal dialect
(Verongpan), would be the one awful word —-
‘ Wuaerangmgalamdziundahl?” Meston says
there is no such language as Yerongpan.
It was an Australian, J. J. Dalton, M.P.
for West Donegal, son of Mr. J. Dalton, of
Orange, N.S.W., and brother-in-law to one of the
Redmonds, who hit “Tim” Healy, a little man
and weak, between the eyes, in a Cork hotel, and
damaged his sight by breaking his spectacles.
Walter Howell, octogenarian, who died at
Cudgel Creek, N.S.W., the other day, was the son
of the soldier who is said to have hauled Governor
Bligh from under the bed when the Macarthur
rum-puncheon gang took possession of Govern-
ment House, Sydney. The hiding and hauling-
out narrative has been discredited by several
writers, and was probably a malicious invention.
According to the “ Queen’s Regulations,”
it is the duty of “commanding officers” to dis-
countenance gambling. “ Field-Marshal ” Wales,
however, is an nnpommanding officer, who coun-
tenances high play even in private houses, and
carries about with him a whole retinue of gamblers.
Unless you happen to bo a gambler you cannot be
a pal of the Prince of Wales.
A “well-informed” London paper avers
that “ the Governors now sent out to Australia
are thorough. Lord Kintore, Governor of South
Australia, intends to cross the colony in a bullock-
van, accompanied by one attendant only, on pur-
pose to personally interview the settlers and assure
them their interests are being well looked after at
Adelaide, which some of the denizens in the north
of that colony seem lately to have been doubting. ”
Delicious,
When David Proudfoot, the railway-con-
tractor, heard of the sudden death of his friend
“Jimmy” Fletcher, the other day, be said, “I
wish it bad been myself instead of poor Jim
Fletcb er. Now that he is gone, we will hear in
the papers what a good man he was. But he can’t
read it. What a fool of a thing it is we can’t say
something good about a man before he dies.”
Two days later Proudfoot himself died while
under chloroform.
We gather that “Joe” Gy me received
from his uncle, David Syme, between £147,000 and
£200,000 for his share—something like one-
seventh—of Melbourne Age. David Syme is now
sole proprietor, and places his son Herbert in
•Joe’s slices as manager of the Age’s commercial
interests. If this severance of partnership be
based on solid values, the Age may be accounted
worth from £1,000,000 to £1,400,000 as a one-man
property. The daily circulation of the Age
averages over 100,000 copies, probably a few
thousands more than the total circulation of any
four Sydney dailies taken together !
Reginald Murray, the Victorian Govt.
Geologist, once officially inspected an alleged
Otway Forest coal discovery, placed on the market
by a syndicate to whom a favorable report from
him would have meant fortune. After careful
inspection the geologiVt (who stutters slightly)
turned to a prominent shareholder: “D d-d-do
you be-be-believe t-that the world will be bur-bur-
burnt up on the last day?’ “Yes,” said the
astonished shareholder. “Then the be-be-best
th ng you can d-d-do is to k-k-keep down this
shaft among y-y-your c-c-coal, and yo-yo-yo you’ll
be quite safe.”
Dr. Schomburgk, the octogenarian Curator
of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, who died
suddenly last week in the arms of his son Otto,
was an ideal scientist—a simple-minded, single-
hearted genius. He came to Adelaide more than
a generation ago, with a younger brother, both
being political refugees from Germany. Another
brother, Sir Robert Schomburgk (who discovered
and named the Victoria Regia in the Brazils), was
a fellow-traveller with the immortal Humboldt,
botanist and naturalist, and it was through the
powerful interest of Humboldt that the escape of
the two Schomburgks was connived at. The de-
ceased controlled the Adelaide Gardens for a
quarter of a century, and probably belonged to
more learned societies than any other scientist in
the whole world. To tail off his name with the
initials of all Ins fellowships and honorary mem-
berships would probably fill half-a-column of The
Bulletin. He was as unaffected as a child, and
nobody could be out of ease with him ; but start
him on a hobby and the world’s mealtimes faded
from his ken, though he was hospitality itself.
Rouse him on any question of humanity’s wrongs,
and his eyes would kindle, while his fluent Eng-
lish struggled for utterance and lost itself in a
maze of German gutturals.
POLITICAL
POINTS
One thing is certain about the Great
Northern Shearers’ insurrection : nobody has yet
been hurt.
The late strike will do at least one good
thing—it will give outspoken if not honest politics
to Australia.
The German census shows a popula-
tion of close on 50 millions, an increase in five
years of over two-and-a-halt-millions.
Robespierre: “No one can be the friend
of the people, and live in a palace.”- No one can
be of the people and yet wear a belitopper.
A lot of people are asking why a requisi-
tion for East Sydney should not he presented to
F. W. Ward, ex-editor of the Sydney Daily
Telegraph?
Many people are wondering why the suc-
cession to the N.Z. Agency-General {vice Sir
Dillon Bell) was offered to W. 43. Perceval, one of
the members for Christchurch.
The most interesting and complete Federal
tion essay yet written is Mr. G. B. Barton’s eon'
tribution on the subject to Greville’s Year Book
of Australia, which should be read by everyone.
The opinion of Convention delegate
“ Charley ” Kingston, M.L.A. and ex-Attorney-
General of South Australia, is that “the late
strike was provoked and continued by the
masters.”
A HARD WORLD.
POLICEMAN: “Hallo! What’s wrong with you?”
INTOXICATED BUSHMAN: “Oh ! it’s very hard to get along in this world.”
Canada is helping England to coerce New-
foundland, not as the daily press says, because
Canada recognises the equity of the French
claims, but because Newfoundland refused to join
the Canadian Federation.
The Australian Fat Men’s Convention,
alias the Federal Conference (the members of
which weigh on an average 14 stone) are being
asked where the Barebones Parliament of the
“ Commonwealth ” is to come in.
A lot of foolish people are now arguing
that Parramatta, the first seat of Government in
Australia, should be the Federal City. One might
as sensibly suggest that all difficulties would be
removed were South Yarra selected as the seat of
Federal Government.
No man ever got such a hold on a Vic-
torian constituency as Langridge did on Colling-
wood, for 19 years. O’Shanassy thought he had
the like grip on Kilmore, but was undeceived by
the paltry little Hunt. Kerferd, at the Ovens,
was the next warmest man to Langridge—and
now !
Millionaire Landlord Mayor Burdekin
(Sydney) the other day truly said: “The great
bulk of N.S. Wales at the present time is devoted
to pastoral pursuits.” What he fo.rgot to add
was—“ The great bulk of the population is shut
out from the land, and lives just a little beyond
starvation point to fatten up a minority of land-
lords.”
Willis, M.L.A. : “ In America, a man who
is libelled can use the cow-hide and pistol with
impunity, but out here the law will not allow
such things, consequently one has to apply to the
law for remedy.” Yes, but we don’t trust people
who are always at law, any more than the Ameri-
cans long submit to bullies who are always “on
the shoot.”
The life of President Andrew Jackson—
“ Old Hickory”—gives us a glimpse of the sort
of man Australia wants at this juncture. We say
at this juncture because it becomes increasingly
necessary to smash “ Englishism ” just as Hickory
smashed it, and flatten out all the absurd
Britannic traditions, launching out boldly and
originally, not even Americanly but Australianly,
for our noble,selves.
Sydney Morning Herald points out that
to English ears the Australian-Federal-Conven-
tion-adopted term, “ Commonwealth, ” implies an
entirely independent Parliament, a Cromwell, and
a decapitated King ; to Australia, it suggests the
cutting of the painter, and an Australian federa-
tion independent of any control by the mother
country. True—and now what does the Herald
propose to do about it ?
The Southern World (Brisbane), run by
Ebenezer Thorne, advocates the importation from
India of a couple of regiments of nigger infantry
to put down “armed mob rule” and to uphold
the authority of the Empress. Ebenezer suggests
that there is a possibility of the proclamation of
martial law, dissolution of both Houses of Parlia-
ment, and the conversion of Queensland into a
crown colony. Hee haw !
The Religious Education League, Mel-
bourne, cannot do better than read a passage in
the new Autobiography of Rev. J. Bickford
(Wesleyan). The writer inserts an extract from
his diary, showing how, while at Bendigo, he had
been disgusted with the sectarian hatred sown by
the denominational schools, and determined to
support a national system of education —which he
sturdily did all through his long Australian
career.
In Queensland many military officers have
been sworn in as Js.P. Lord Justice Mansfield,
who was hardly a Liberal, denounced a Ministerial
attempt to do this kind of thing at the Cordon-
riots epoch. Look at the matter in this way ;in
cases of riot the military act only on the authority
of the civil power. There is, constructively at
least, a balance and checking of powers if the two
are kept thus distinct, but once unite them and
where is the check ?
A Mr. Lovegrove asserts in the S.M.
Herald (for the information of Mr. B. R.
Wise) that the employment of children in fac-
tories was not due to the desii’e of British manu-
facturers for cheap labour, but “ was the result of
the avarice of the fathers and mothers of the
children, and the modifications of the system were
the result of the exertions of philanthropists, on
whose sidethe capitalists ranged themselves.” The
Bulletin, admiring Lovegrove’s delightful Frou-
daoity, gladly welcomes him as the latest addition
to the ranks of the historians.
Senator Hawley, of Connecticut, U.S.A.,
recently tried to scare Congress with the ques-
tion ; “What are you going to do when you find
British war-vessels in the harbour of New York?”
To which the New York Com mercial Advertiser
replied ; —“ We will tell the Senator what we are
going to do in such a dire emergency. With the
first gun fired from a British cruiser we are going
to confiscate every dollar’s worth of confiscable
property owned by Great Britain in the United
States. Englishmen at present own in this
country considerably more than one billion
dollars’ worth of property. We suspect that the
British Cabinet will think twice before ordering a
bombardment of an American city.”
The indicted Australian Republican says
that the Charters Towers Postmaster has received
instructions to read copies of the paper before
sending it through the post, thereby constituting
a man who has probably had no literary experi-
ence, “ a fully empowered press censor, able to
decide what -opinions the public shall peruse or
hold, and what not.” It complains that Editor
Vosper was prevented from posting copies of the
“sedition” to his solicitors to enable them to
prepare his defence ; also that some of Vosper’s
letters have been tampered with while passing
through the post. No copy of the alleged seditious
editions have yet readied The Bulletin office.
Under Oath.
An old lawyer says that many men, whose
common conversation can generally be relied on,
are prone to prevaricate when they are placed
under oath. In common conversation they have
no reason to tell anything but the truth. When
under oath there are generally influences favour-
ing deviation from the line’ of exact accuracy.
These influences are stronger than their con-
scientious regard for truth on its own account, or
their fear of any penalty that might follow ex-
posure, the danger of which is slight. So they
swear to what is not true. Most men, however,
can be depended on to tell the truth, on the
witness-stand or off, in matters which are of
moment to their fellows. The majority of men are
honest; they will not willingly do any great in-
justice to their fellow travellers along life’s high-
way, but, on the contrary, are glad to assist in
making the journey pleasant and profitable. There
are very few men indeed, no matter what cynics
may say, who will put themselves out to work
injury to others ; but hundreds may be found any
day who will go out of their way, cheerfully and
gladly, to say or do something they have reason
to believe will assist or comfort those who are un-
fortunate. It is because of this prevailing senti-
ment in our civilised Christian community that
tens of thousands of voluntary testimonials are
annually received similar to these. W. H. M‘Glew,
proprietor of Vulcan Foundry, Perth, Western
Australia, December 10, 1890, writes :—“ Some
four or five years I was taken with Bright’s
Disease, and my doctor held out no possible hope
of recovery. I was so close to death’s door that
my demise was currently reported in town. I
was afflicted with dropsy, pains in the loins, my
breath came in short gasps, while my urine showed
a large percentage of albumen. When it was
expected that I could not live above a few days or
hours, 1 began the use of Warner’s safe cure. To
my complete and happy surprise, as well as the
amazement of my doctors, the dropsy abated, I
could again breathe freely, and hopes of a recovery
dawned upon me. I have since continued its
use, all my pains have left me, and my strength
has fully returned. I owe my present existence
to its use.” Yuin, West Australia, sth January,
1891 :—“ Some six years ago my health was pros-
trated, and I had to give up work, being then
engaged in mining pursuits in Broken Hill. After
consulting the leading doctors in Adelaide I was
informed that lead poisoning had set in, and also
that I was afflicted with the dread Bright’s disease
of the kidneys. Being urged to try Warner’s
safe cure I did so, and with the use of four bottles
there was a marked improvement ; when I had
taken 16 bottles, I had fully recovered my health
and strength. J. T. O’Donnell, Mining Pro-
spector.” Persons who have been afflicted natur-
ally feel for the afflictions of others ; thus prac-
tically do they attest the sincerity of their sym-
pathy.

Premier Parkes, incensed at the treatment
extended to him by Government House in its social
capacity, lias very properly made up his mind to
stand on his dignity and to attend no functions at
which Governor and Laid y Jersey are presentunless
absolutely compelled by duty to do so. Thus,
whereas in the ordinary course of things he would
no doubt ha e attended the Campbelltown mili-
tary encampment in company with the Earl and
Countess, lie and Lady Parkes paid their visit in
advance and had a march-past all to themselves.
The old man is the official boss of the military
officers, and you bet they were civil to him and
Lady P.
# * *
Apropos to the social disturbance in a high
Sydney circle, it is related that a certain Govern-
ment House young man put it this way within
the sacred precincts of the Warrigal Club : “It
is all very well, don’t you know,” said he, lifting
up lus voice, “ to talk about what you would do if
you were Lord Jersey, but then, donchersee, you
don’t happen to be Lord Jersey. Lord Jersey
has not only to consider the well-known opinions
of Her Majesty the Queen on such subjects, but
he has to consider likewise the status and views
of his wife, Lady Jersey, and also his own posi-
tion as Governor and social head of the—aw—
colony, don’t you know. And then, even suppose
that the considerations I have alluded to never
came into force in the matter, my own social
position would begin to operate, I assure you.”
Which was all carefully carried to Premier Parkes.

Miss “Concord” Walker, the N.S.W.
millionairess —no sham million, mind you, but a
million and more of solid cash— has given £250
towards sending a contingent of the Tenterfield
Mounted Infantry to England. Miss Walker had
just previously given £lOOO to provide certain
New Guinea “ missionaries ” with a steamer. The
priests and the soldiers will have a long, good
time when the women rule in politics.

One phase of Chief Secretary Langridge’s
sudden death was not noticed by the Melbourne
press. Some of the responsibility for the recent
hangings rested upon the Chief Secretary, and
three days before his end he had assisted to satisfy
the “Crown” that Wilson—executed on the
Monday—was in sane mind when he cut his
sweetheart’s throat. On the Tuesday morning
Mrs. Langridge gave her husband the newspapers
to read in bed. Almost immediately afterwards
she found him dead, killed, perhaps, by the
shock of the reminder that young Wilson had
protested his irresponsibility on the very scaffold in
the presence of God, the executioner and several
well-known “city gents. ” who had come to see
him strangled. Anyhow, friends of Mr. Lang-
ridge admit that the final decisions in the cases of
Phelan, and Wilson gave him much anxiety, even if
the latter scandal didn’t cost him his life.
Naturally a kind-hearted man, he had endea-
voured to silence his conscience with wretched
legal chestnuts and references to the serious duty
devolving upon a Minister of the Crown, &c., &c.
and failed. Poor old Langridge !
The Parramatta Cottage Homes were,
states the Cumberland Times, “readied up” to
bluff Lady Jersey into undeserved admiration.
Borrowed trees, earthed in big tubs which were
buried out of sight beneath the surface of the
natural soil, gave an Arcadian glamour to a
usually prosaic waste. When the morrow came,
those tubs were dug up again and the trees carted
back to their original owners ! If Lord or Lady
Jersey want to see any public institutions as they
really are, let them pay a surprise visit to any one
of them, and they may count on a surprise recep-
tion. If they will but adopt ihis plan, keep their
eyes open and talk freely in public as to their
experiences, they will not only do N.S. Wales a
service, but set a good example to the world.
# * #
The quarrel between Coroner Youl and
Surgeon Shiels over the body of the executed
Phelan reminds us of the case of Harrison, the
contractor, hanged, with Woods and Carver, the
bank-robbers, for shooting his partner, Marsh, in
front of the Melbourne Public Works Office,
many years ago. The doctors were divided as to
Harrison’s sanity, Professor Halford heading
those who believed him to be insane, while Dr.
M‘Crae led the other side. After execution and
post-mortem, the “ mad ” doctors got hold of the
brains of the dead man for examination. Chief-
Secretary M'Culloch heard of it and despatched
the then Sheriff, Claude Fario, to demand the
remains. When the Sheriff arrived, the doctors
were duly examining the gruesome parcel and
declined to give way. “But,” said Farie, “they
are_ the Government’s brains.” “I can quite
believe that,” said Halford; “they are of a very
poor quality.”

lima Vaughan to Myles M‘Eae :—“ I
would much rather that you were not a member
of Parliament, as there are plenty of men in Par-
liament now who would be better employed adorn-
ing a gaol.”

AUSTRALIAN “COOK-LADY” (who has just opened the door and interrupted a delightful tête-à-
fête between her mistress and the new curate) : “Did ye want me, mum?”
MISTRESS (sharply) : “No, I did not.”
COOK-LADY: “Oh, all roight-kape yer hair on—oi thought oi heard yez yell!”
It was alleged during the hearing of the
much-discussed breaoh-of-promise case, that Myles
M‘Rae and Miss lima Vaughan were sent away
from the Hotel Metropole, Sydney, for impro-
priety. Now, how does it happen that not a
single word of evidence was called concerning this
matter i The alleged occurrence was a crucial
point in the case, and had it been established it
would have completely discredited M'Rae’s
evidence.

An alleged lunatic, interrogated before
Hay (N.S.W.) Police Court, replied to a question
as to his domestic condition—“ I’m sometimes
married and sometimes single, like a good many
more.” No lunacy in that.

A recent marriage in England has some
interest for N.S. Wales, the bride being the
daughter of Mr. Commissioner Grenfell, who was
shot by a bushranger near Narramine, below
Dubbo, in 1866. Grenfell was on the box-seat of
the coach when stuck up, and was about to draw
his revolver when killed. The murderer was never
discovered, though a well-to-do man in the district
was long under suspicion,

A kind of religious “strike” just now
prevails in some of the large Melbourne factories.
One of the he-women who spend their time in
distributing tracts, addressing “Mothers’ meet-
ings,” &c., lately spoke somewhat slightingly of
the “ character ”of factory girls; and now when-
ever she visits the factories she is freezingly re-
ceived. A short time ago, in a large clothing
factory, not one out of the 300 girls employed
would accept a tract. An exception, however, is
made in the case of pretty, piquant Mrs. “ Social-
Purity ” Lee, who, up to the present, appears t _
have managed her delicate mission with commend
able tact.

About the middle of next week another
trusted and conscientious bank official will go off
as usual, leaving the customary shortage behind
him. We publish this statement before he goes,
so as to be ahead of the daily papers. He will be
tall and slim, and have his hair parted in the
middle; also, he will wear a stand-up collar. He
will be found to be an individual who never went
out at night, and it is three chances to one that
he was the sole support of an aged father, also of
a young lady with golden hair and a pale-blue
dressing-gown. Any director having a person
like this in his employ will do well to keep his eye
on him. The usual church member will also be
found out misconducting himself with one of the
girls in the choir about the 15th of next month ;
and towards the same date there will be a big fire
in a Sydney warehouse, but the place will be so
effectually combusted that no one will ever find
out that most of the stock wasn’t there when the
accident happened. Besides, the proprietor will
give a handsome bonus to the fire-insurance official
who values the damage, and thus make matters all
right. A few days later one of the most conspicuous
Christians in N.S.W. will be laid up, owing to a
severe illness, having been badly walloped by an
indignant husband, who came home and found
the good man escaping out of his front window.
This complaint will be called, as usual, inflamma-
tion of the lungs, which will be a lie, also as usual.
Near the end of April there will be serious
rumours about the character of an honoured and
upright citizen, but it will presently be announced
that the vague charges circulated against him
were entirely unfounded, and arose out of that
envenomed malignity which seems to be engraved
on certain base and despicable minds. This is a
short or abbreviated way of saying that he gave
£5O to the father of the girl, and squared the
policeman.

The latest Sydney defaulter says: “I

In the big Centennial Hall, Sydney, the

bell ; in a word, the bell is inscribed with the
“ illoquint ” Postmaster-General O’Connor’s name
in big letters. Another injustice to Ireland!

A correspondent of the Field, writing

are Vandaleurs, Talbots, De Courcys, Stanleys,

A well-known Victorian squatter, who
held a great deal of landed property, nominally
transferred much of it to various people years ago
to avoid the full effects of the then prospective
progressive land-tax. One station he put in the
name of a married female relative, who died, and
her husband —he has married again calmly
sticks to the station, now worth £50,000. It is
hopeless for the squatter to try to get it back, fur
as the basis of civil proceedings he would have to
confess that he had taken part in a conspiracy to,
defraud the Government.

The Sydney public should keep its eye on
the local Gas Company’s attempt to secure from
Parliament electric-lighting concessions. The
proper scheme would be to have the right of
electric-lighting vested in the City Corporation,
which would thus be given a chance of buying
out the Gas Company at something like a reason-
able figure one of these days. To confer further
powers upon the Gas Company will be to further
entrench a noxious private monopoly and enable
it to defy the public. All public services must
in future be controlled by the public.

A TOPICAL BALLAD.
Some folks attempt in reckless way
(Such is their constitution)
To do a lot of things which they
Can’t bring to execution.
Yet latterly the bard has dreamt
(When gin he’d been diluting)
Of folks who nothing much attempt,
But keep on executing.
The Law’s not always put in force
When swindles are committed,
Nor does it seem to “ take its course ”
When bigwigs are acquit-ted.
Though from a rope at certain times
Poor, decent chaps are dan-gled,
To expiate financial crimes
’Tis justice that is stran-gled.
So, let us sing “ God Save the Queen ”
In loud and loyal chorus :
We must eat fat as well as lean—
This fact is e’er before us.
At wealthy rogues we wink our eye,
But O ! we’ll never fal-ter
In doing double duty by
The hei’oes of the hal-ter.
CHURCH BELLS.
( A SABBATH MORNING’S SOLILOQUY.)
Borne upon the morning air
Comes the sound of bells;
’Tis a sound I can’t abear
Church bells make me, I declare.
Angry as a grizzly bear—
Startled in his lonely lair—
When the foe he smells.
Born upon the morning air
Comes the sound of bells;
To the old church, over there,
Buxom wives and maidens fair
Flock to quiz what others wear,
Or, perchance, to smirk and stare
At some spooney swells.
Borne upon the morning air
Comes the sound of bells ;
To the old church, over there,
Goes the merchant, full of care—
Red of face, and white of hair,
Thinking how he can prepare
Borne new, clever, business snare—
Brooding o’er fresh “sells.”
Borne upon the morning air
Comes the sound of bells ;
To the old church, over there,
Crowds are thronging, I’m aware,
All arrayed in raiment rare :
Yet I cannot help but swear
At the very notion bare—
That, among them all, there’s ne’er
One with thoughts intent on prayer—
Parents, beaux, or belles.

SUICIDE OR NO SUICIDE.
The New York Life Insurance Company
Pays Its Policy.
It being evident that most cases of self-destruc-
tion involve causes not under the victim’s own
control, and that accident and murder may easily
give rise to a suspicion of voluntary death, the
New York Life Insurance Company, in order to
prevent wrongs to the unfortunate, makes its
policies absolute security. It exercises caution in
granting a policy, and never issues one unless its
officers consider the applicant a good risk. But
when it has once issued its policy and taken the
premium, it feels bound to insure. It does not
insert in its policies the usual clause making them
void in case of “self-destruction, voluntarily or
involuntarily, sane or insane,” and claims no re-
lease from its contract except where there is
evidence of a purpose to defraud. In short, so
far as a life policy may properly be such, the New
York Life’s policies are incontestable from the
moment the first premium is paid. The man with a
New York Life Insurance policy may feelsuro that,
incase of his death, no delay, litigation or loss will
arise from the question of self-destruction—
whether it be accidental or otherwise. If he has
been honestly insured, and honestly conforms to
the simple requirements of the contract, the pay-
ment of his policy is sure on proof of his death.

place, instead of marrying the deceased wife,
which was a thing which no religious person could

It is noteworthy that no distinctly ugly
woman has yet applied for a divorce under Shiels’
Act. Divorces are exceedingly numerous in Vic-
toria now, and there are seldom less than a score
of applications on the list, but all the female
applicants are more or less good-looking. Gene-
rally, however, the respondent is ugly enough for
two, or even for three. Now and then a dis-
tinctly ugly woman applies for relief under the
provisions of the old Act on a charge of adultery,
and in those cases the respondent is passable, and
his accomplice is a gladsome vision of loveliness ;
but when the case is merely one of desertion, the
ugly woman evidently puts up with it. When
the situation is reversed, however, and the hus-
band is the petitioner, it is generally safe to bet
that the lady is built on such a plan that she
couldn’t show herself outside the house after dark
on Saturday without breaking the Sabbath, and
the co-respondent isn’t much better. Occasionally,
however, there is an exception, and the husband is
found trying to shake off a good-looking wife,
“THE STRAIGHT TIP.”

and in these instances, strangely enough, the co-
respondent is usually hideous to look at. This is
one of the unaccountable features of the business,
for why a pretty girl should quit her home to
elope with a very plain person it is difficult to guess.
Possibly, however, the animal is good to her,
because* he knows that he would never get another
pretty woman to elope with him even if he wore
his dress-clothes for a century, and their union is
one of poetic sentiment after all.

“ Walls have ears.” Theodore Emmond
is charged in New York, says a Dalziel cable-
gram to the London press, with conspiracy and
defamation of character. He boarded with a
Mrs. Dusen and, dissatisfied with the quality of
the food, placed a phonograph in the kitchen and
bribed the cook to set it going while her mistress
was talking. This she did, and then Emmond set
the phonograph talking before the assembled
boarders and Mrs. Dusen:—“Mary, you don’t
want to pay over Bc. a pound for meat anyhow.
It’s good enough for them. You can get it in
Mulberry-street for that. You are giving too big
prices for steak. If they don’t like it let them eat
more vegetables. Yesterday you bought fresh
pie ; how often have I told you to save oc. by
getting it stale and warming it up ? Then this bill
of 25c. a pound for coffee is too much ; coffee at
15c. a pound will do in the future. I have got
enough trouble to make both ends meet without
feeding three men at $5 a week on porter-home
steak.” Mrs. Dusen streaked for her lawyer
without hearing all. Case proceeding.
# * #
The above is one of the thinnest jokes that
ever went the round of the “stupid ’’ papers, British
and Australian. The idea of a phonograph
“ taking anything down ” unknown.to the utterer,
might have been funny When it was first suggested
but it can’t be seriously entertained by people who
have watched, say, Jimmy MacMahon, in the act
of talking, with painful effort and awful delibera-
tion, down a phonograph-tube. Besides, the
scientific toy makes about as much noise as a
watermill when it is working.

Dear Bulletin,—The case of Bourke, the
ex-convict murderer, who at Hamilton Gaol killed
his fellow prisoner, and is to be executed therefor,
reminds me that there are still a few of the old
hands ” left in Victoria. I saw one a year or two
ago in Geelong Hospital, with circular indenta-
tions just above both ankles, caused by the
“irons.” The old fellow was a curious mixture
of religion and profanity. He would sit up in
bed and pray, in his old way, until exhausted;
when he would lie back exclaiming “ I’m damned
[gasp) if I can pray any longer {gasp), God, so I
must [gasp) stop.” Ho died in the hospital after a
short illness. —Yours, F.S.S.
O football cure, O land-boom lure,
O multifakir clever,
If our consumption suits your “ cure,"
We’ll get Ti-Ta than ever.

ART AND NATURE COMBINED.
It is not on record who invented swimming, or
whether it was ever invented at all. In fact,
nobody seems to have any authentic information
on the subject of how the art was first acquired.
There are, of course, those with poetic ideas on
the matter who could give you all sorts of notions
about it. But we incline to the idea that Adam,
being at all hours for a considerable period in full
bathing costume, took to the water naturally—
being then immortal and consequently undrownable
—and that, subsequently, having tasted the sweets
of laving in the luxurious depths of the Tigris, he
solaced himself for his departed happiness by
continuing the exercise, even when it became
necessary to unfig to so indulge. Then he pro-
bably showed Cain and Abel and his other sons
and daughters how it was done, and so the thing
has gone on from generation to generation, till at
a rough computation there are at the present
time two-thirds of the world’s inhabitants who
can swim. We in Sydney, however, are not
perhaps sufficiently appreciative of the gifts
which Nature has bestowed upon us. Be that as
it may, without a doubt a large proportion of our
city population do not take advantage, or possibly
are not able to take advantage of the natural
facilities offered to them, and do not bathe in the
harbour or the ocean. Assuming that all were
willing and many unable to get to the various
outside resorts, for want of opportunity, the
Sydney Bathing Company stepped into the field
three or four years ago, and established in Pitt-
street their now famous Natatorium, which
enables those who cannot proceed out of the city
to indulge in a dip at any period of the year, with
all or even more than the advantages afforded by
the ocean or harbour itself. In connection with
these extensive baths, Nature has, as it were, been
taken by the nape of the neck and thoroughly
subjugated by means of human ingenuity and a
25-horse power steam-boiler, so that the busy city
man, the pater familias who is engaged all
day, or his wife and family, can be accom-
modated with all the blessings of sea-
bathing and without the trouble of having
to go after it. There, in the very heart
of the city, is ready to hand a stretch of water,
ample for all the purposes of a delightful marine
revel, and with every accommodation, yet minus
the disagreeable surroundings which occasionally
accompany a visit to the public baths. The very
idea makes one feel quite rhapsodical and almost
inclined to quote Wordsworth
There is no poetry about the real thing, however.
It is eminently a practical affair, this Natatorium,
which is now so well known to the bulk of swim-
mers that it needs but little description. For the
benefit of the uninitiated, it may nevertheless be
stated that the Natatorium is situated at the
southern end of Pitt-street, between Goulburn and
Campbell-streets. The baths consist of two
basins, each 100 ft. long by 40ft. broad, and almost
equal in capacity. The No. 1 bath has a depth
ranging from 3ft. Sin. to Oft , and carries 160,000
gallons, while the No. 2 basin ranges in depth
from 3ft. Gin. to Bft Gin., with a capacity of
140,000 gallons. This appears to constitute the
only difference between the two basins. The
water is obtained from near Lady Macquarie’s
Chair by the same pipes, and almost equal
accommodation is provided for bathers. But,
with a view to meeting the requirements of
all classes of the community, a charge
of one shilling for admission is made tc
the No. 1 basin, during the day, the company
there being generally more select, while for the
man with less scruples on the subject of com-
panionship, or perhaps less of the needful, No. 2
is available at the modest fee of sixpence. These
prices apply, however, only to the daytime, as,
alter 6.30 p.m. the admission to each basin is
reduced by one-half. Some curious social calcu-
lations might be worked out from the numbers of
the attendances at the two baths, but that need
not be done here. It is a fact, however, that an
examination made at two or three different periods
of the day has frequently shown that the attend-
ance in tfo. 2, or the second-class bath, was exactly
double that in the other. These figures apply only
to the male patrons of the baths, however, as, so
far, the sterner sex have proved the most regular
attendants. Originally, one bath was set apart
every morning for ladies, but as the patronage was
very" small, this arrangement was altered to three
mornings each week. Still there was no great
improvement in the attendance ; and, finally, after
trying it for two mornings a week, the directors
decided to devote one evening (Monday) alone to
the ladies instead. The new arrangement has
succeeded beyond expectations, and there has
been a remarkable increase, for whereas for-
merly, perhaps, only 16 or 17 ladies put in
an appearance, on Monday last over 160
attended. In fact, the baths are now becoming so
popular with the fair sex that it is under contem-
plation to set apart an additional morning or
evening for them. A great impetus has been
given to the pastime amongst the ladies by the
establishment of the Dual Club, an organisation
which, under a system of strict selection by the
committee of management, permits ladies and
gentlemen to bathe together. In no other way is
it possible in Sydney for a husband to teach his
wife or daughters the natatory art, and so much is
the boon appreciated that already, after a few
weeks of life, the club numbers over 160 members.
Appropriate, costumes are of course insisted upon
for the bathers, and the strictest propriety is
observed, full enquiry be ; ng made as to the posi-
tion and character of every candidate for admis-
sion. By this means the status of the club is
maintained, and it is hoped that great advantage
and pleasure will be derived by the members from
the recreation. In view of the cold weather
which may shortly be expected, it is in-
tended to make arrangements next month
by which the temperature of the water of the
baths will be raised during the winter months to
85°, which will have the effect of making sea-
bathing enjoyable throughout the year. It is also
under contemplation to utilise the powerful boiler
in connection with the establishment to light the
premises by electricity, and to place lamps below
the water. It may, indeed, be said that the
directors are doing everything possible to make
the Natatorium the premier establishment of its
kind in the Southern hemisphere, and it is only
natural to expect that the public patronage will
increase in like ratio. A par ft from the public
swimming baths, there are on the premises about
20 plunge and shower baths, in which may be
obtained hot fresh and salt water, and cold fresh
water. These facilities are largely availed of by
invalids and others, and already many persons
reside for a term at the Grand Natatorium Hotel
(connected witli the baths) for the express purpose
of bathing in the hot sea water, which is said to
have great curative properties for rheumatism.
The baths are under the capable management of
Mr. Barry, who devotes everv energy to the
comfort of his patrons.

ARISTOCRATIC TOUT),
Whose phenomenal wire on the Newmarket Handicap
day so astonished the ENTIRE sporting community,
WAS AGAIN TO THE FORE LAST CAULFIELD
Meeting by giving Three Winners out of Four Selec.ions,
including HARPER for the Steeplechase ; and his only-
selection which went down, viz., Opera, the stewards of
the meeting have since shown what, they thought her
chance would have been, had all been as it SHOULD have
been.
Terms now reduced to IDs. for a wire ANY race-day-,
with REALLY RELIABLE SELECTIONS, sent out by
11 o’clock on the morning of the race to ANY address or
to the grand stand; or, THE INFORMATION may by
had each morning by calling at address at foot.
Mr. S.' varies very much from all other tipsters, inas-
much as he NEVER gives more than ONE horse in a race.
Some REAL GOOD THINGS, send at once or CALL.
Send for Mr. S.’s circular, wherein he demonstrates by
COMMON SENSE WHY he MUST be in a better position
than ANY OTHER Turf Adviser to impart REALLY re-
'iable informadon, and more especially over Suburban
Meetings such as the above.
HAWKESBURY HANDICAP.
THREE “DEAD BIRDS.”
Send immediately, 10s. each selection, or £1 for the
three, well worth backing AT ONCE. This information
has been obtained only at the greatest expense and
trouble.
Mr. S. also advises over every RACE day at SYDNEY,
l()s. a day, or £1 10s. for the FOUR DAYS. THE IE
wires will be ready to be sent out from address at foot by
10 a.m. each race morning, so that clients in Sydney and
elsewhere can receive them long before racing commences.

horses at the recent Y.R.C. Meeting 1

THE REFEREE.
In the Hurdle Race, English rode a most
peculiar race on The Mason, and indeed it looked very
much at one period of the race as if lie were rot wanted,
but the distance told, and at t ie finish his mount was the
only one able to raise a gallop.
# # *
It was a wonderful reversal of form for Strom-
boli to beat Penance so easily in the A. J.O. Sires’ Produce
Stakes. In Melbourne Penance gave him a stone
and a had heating, but on Saturday could not make
him gallop at level weights. When Stromboli won his
llisj race at Warwick Farm, The Bulletin picked him as
the colt of the season.
# * *
Marvel ran a great horse in the Sydney Don-
caster. He made a desperate attempt to catch Paris at
the distance, and gor His nose to the colt’s girths, hut
Bricky Colley- was too great a general to allow him up on
the inside, and Harris had to pull out and come on the
outside. The Marvel crowd saved themselves on Paris,
but again showed that their horse is one of the best
“ milers” in Australia.
* # #
“ Jimmy ” Monaghan was so cock-sure of Paris
winning the Doncaster that he put £lO on the colt, more
money than he ever put on a horse before.
# * *
The finish for the Doncaster was so close that
Bricky Colley, who rode Paris, saved £lO with Lyddiard
on Helene after the horses had passed the winning-post.
* * *
The public showed themselves great judges over
the Doncaster. They backed three horses, who finished
first, second, and third.
# # *
The Selling Race was a very close thing, and
after they passed the post Dan Lawson bet several
“fivers” that his horse Strephon had not won.
# * #
Linnegar rode a bad race on Grey gown in the
St. Leger. After making the pace all the wayand pulling
his mount all over the course, he allowed Ellis to ccmo
up on the inside with Correze,
# * *
Good one as Highborn undoubtedly is, he could
not even make a race of it with Carbine in the Autumn
Stakes. The Champion simply played with him, and
although only cantering at the finish, ran the last six
furlongs in linin'. Ifisecs.
* # *
The Sydney Cup win of W. T. Jones’s thousand-
guinea purchase, Highborn, a five-year-old, with 9st. 31b.
and John Gough in the saddle, was fairly popular, but
the public keep asking where would lie have been had
Carbine remained “ in.” The second of the three-yearer,
-Greygown, under Bst. 51b., was creditable, and it was
hard luck for the owner to get beaten in two big races so
narrowly. The third horse, Yowi (a four-yearer, under
list. 21b.), wasn’t half a length away from the winner.
# * *
Turf morality has not gained much by the
recent freak of the V.A.T.O. stewards in conned ion with
an already notorious mare named Opera. At the allcgi d
request of the owner an enquiry was held into ibis
animal’s monstrously stiff running for the St. Kilda Cup,
at Caulfield. The owner’s request was obviously super-
fluous, inasmuch as nothing but a sudden attack of blind-
ness all round could have excused the powers that were
from recognising the necessity of “doing something” (o
somebody or something. They accordingly made an
example of the jockey-boy by disqualifying him for 12
months. Now, the hoy would cither he pulling under
instructions from ids owner, or trainer, or else lie would
ho working a swindle on his own account, to the
hurt and mischief of his employers. As the stewards
omitted to call upon owner and trainer for any
statement, they must have held them innocent of
complicity in the scandal. Being innocent, the owner
would naturally be an especial object of sympathy to his
friends the law-givers. Wherefore to mark their sense of
the wrong already inflicted upon that unfortunate
man they decided to disqualify Opera far twelve months!
Here we have conclusive proof that the stewards saw
reason to suspect that the mare had pulled the jockey,
in which case the jockey deserved commiseration. And,
as Opera’s enforced idleness will no doubt suit her down
to the ground, it is as clear as a turfite’s conscience that
several human beings will have to suffer so that a degraded
female quadruped may be encouraged to resume her evil
courses at the expiration of twelve months.
# * #
At last one of the Melbourne papers (Age) lias
commented upon Mr. George Watson’s unsatisfactory
starting. Fora long time it has been quite usual to see
short-distance races decided, in a great measure, by the
fall of the flag, one horse getting away ngths in front
of everything, whilst one or two others were fairly and
squarely left at the post. On such occasions a great groan
of amazement is heard from the stand at Flemington, or
Caulfield, but up to now the reporters have not ceased to
slobber over their venerable chestnut, “the Prince of
Starters.” They couldn’t bestow more butter on George
Watson if he were the “renowned caterer” who buys
the drivellers up, body and soul, with complimentary
luncheon-tickets.
John Murtagh Macrossan, the Machiavelli
of North Queensland, the Zalinski gnu of the
Queensland Opposition and a delegate to the Aus-
tralian Federal Convention, died at the Grosvenor
Hotel, Sydney, on Easter Monday, of heart
disease and dropsy. “Jack” Macrossan was an
acrid entity and not a loveable personality. He
was a bitter hater, and his springs of friendship
were too deeply and inscrutably sunk to evoke
spontaneous confidence. He was a Donegal boy,
and was very highly educated indeed after the
Catholic manner, though he was always reticent
as to his youthful training and chances, merely
admitting having attended “local schools.” It
has been openly asserted, and circumstances some-
times lent vraisemblance to the statement, that
Macrossan was originally educated for the
Romish priesthood, which profession he cer-
tainly would have adorned. If he was,
he missed fire, and turned up as a “hatter”
digger on old Bendigo, Ballarat, &c., and
afterwards on Ravenswood, JS.Q. The diggers
there gave “ Jack the Hatter ” his -first rise into
Parliament, and he developed a genius for “con-
tracting,” and was soon reckoned as having an
intermittent periodicity of office as Minister of
Works and Mines. Vapours of scandal frequently
enveloped his private relations to official oppor-
tunities, but he clove through them with un-
daunted front. Lately he was credited with
having been admitted into the ring of “first
robbers ” in the Mount Morgan variations. He
was the political head, too, of the Northern
Separation agitation, though lately he adroitly
’verted to Griffith’s tri-sectional scheme, much to
the disgust of Old Man Billy Coote and other
leaders of the movement. In spite of his abilities
and past j irestige, Jack Macrossan was so distrusted
at the last general elections in Queensland that had
not the new Townsville idol. Bob Philp, tacked
him on to his own coat-tails, his candidature
would have resulted in defeat. Jack Macrossan
was a good sectarian first and a good Queens-
lander only second. But he was above all a lone-
hand player for his personal interests. He was
feared and toadied to, but never loved. He repaid
enforced respect with scorn. His spleen was
venoined, and yet cultured—-a dangerous debater
to offend, fox’, serene in bis own secretiveness, he
trusted no one, and spared no one who trusted
and afterwards failed him. His death is the
removal of a mottled brilliancy. He married a
lady who once dispensed medical comforts to the
Ravenswood diggers, and who never dreamed that
Jack the Hatter, a silent and reserved little hermit,
was “in the running.” He was not quite GO
years old, but physically a broken-down man,
although in his day he had been as good a man of
his inches and weight as ever hammered a drill
CORRESPONDENCE
“ J.F.” : The indifference of young Australia to
all political and national alfairs is founded chiefly on
ignorance and a well-filled stomach “E.A.”: Tub
Bulletin goes for a straight-out Republic, because it
doesn’t want Mrs. England, Australia’s mother-in-law,
taking up her quarters in Australia’s house....“A. B.
Fowler”: So-called “ freedom of contract ” reduces labour
to the unit, and so places it absolutely at the mercy of
Capital, which has no mercy. That is why “Written
in Sand ” was played lately in Sydney by, we think, the
Printers’ Dramatic Society. Williamson and earner hold
colonial rights....“ A. J. Ware”: What can be hoped
from a Minister who can sec nothing in the cases of
Sweetraan and the other Mount Rennie convicts to call
for clemency Blawstcd Kerlonial”: We hold your
opinions concerning Jerome in the main. “Stageland”
is, so far as we know, his most original book, but the
little one-act play, “ Barbara,” is, possibb', his best
literary effort.... “ A.M.S.” :It is dangerous to get drunk
with alcohol, it is also dangerous to get drunk
with chloroform. One day you see a man who looks a
perfect wreck, and in whose case the surgeons apprehend
danger, successfully kept under chloroform for half-an-
hour in a tedious operation ; next day you find a strapping
man, with an apparently sound heart, suddenly fade away
under the drug. Apart from the small trouble for which
he was operated on, any insurance-office would have
accepted Mr. Proudtoofs life “ J.M.B. ’: Thanks....
“G.D.M.”; “Starlite” has much merit, but it is very
uneven and too long for our columns.... “W. Owen”: The
phrase “ Infanticide or some similar check” includes all
you are writing about, and supplies a correct answer to
the question witli which you conclude “Norman ” : (1)
You are correct. (2) The institution, introduced by the
Normans, originally a custom only, became legalised by
immemorial usage until at length land was granted by
the feudal lords on conditions of which it was almost
invariably one. (3) Mark Twain’s book, “A Yankee at
King Arthur's Court,” speaks of it; for historic treatment
see legal codes. (4) Feudalism began to decay with the
Wars of the Roses, rapidly disintegialcd with accession
of Henry VII. in 1483, and finally expired with the reign
of Charles 11 ...“ K 0.D.” : The Federal Convention lias
no idea of founding an Australian Republic....“ J. L.
Mae.” : Ycur Jersey parody is funnier than you intended.
. .. .G.F.M.” : Will read it, but please keep copy of MS. if
you value it... “R.H.”; We don’t know which arc
Republican papers and which aren’t, hut The Bulletin
was the first paper in Australia to declare for the Rej üb-
lie right 0ut....“ Dave ” : Too local altogether....
“ Anxious”: (1.) in ’BB there were 1933 State-schools in
Victoria with an enrolment of 58,728. (2.) Don’t know-
how many churches there were, but the alleged church-
goers equalled five-sixths of the population, and everyone
knows that a tenth would be nearer the mark. (3.) Have
no means of ascertaining amount paid for wages in ’90....
“ J. 8.”: The scene was humorous, but you can hardly
make anything much of it in print....“ A.C.G.” : Don’t
agree with you, but all the same wo don’t think that
“ Commonwealth ” is a name to which Australia will take
very kindly. The English associations of the term are
not altogether congenial to people in general, Hut “Com-
monwealth,” which certainly admits of no king, is much
better than “Dominion,” which implies kingly sovereignty
“ T.K.” (Melb.): Many thanks; subject, however, has
been thrashed out by the press “E.A.G.”: Under the

This yarn is told of Jack Macrossan, who
died on Easter Monday. A beauteous Hebe had
been imported from Sydney to Ravenswood in the
good time of the Ravenswood rush, and much
additional digger patronage was in consequence
lavished upon the enterprising publican who em-
ployed her. So the usually unwashed digger
would array himself in his “slop "best, and even
put on a “ biled rag,” before doing his evening
“lean-over” at Hebe’s bar. But the gorgeous
civil servant ! Though ids next month’s “screw ”
was already mortgaged “ on the slate,” he revelled
in paper collars, dickies, cuffs, store clothes, and
even low-cut vests ! His “lean-overs ” would be
long and dry. One evening, a pair of these
bush dandies elbowed the counter for an hour,
talking sweet mash to Hebe, but not daring to
order libations, for their slate-margin was full
though their throats were hard. Old “Jack the
Hatter,” grimy and furrowed with toil, sat in
neglige on an up-ended bucket, silent and un-
noticed. After long contemplation he rose,
marched slowly to the counter, prodded his right
thumb downwards on to its surface, and said with
impressive huskiness —“ Less blooming clothes
here, and more rum ! Fill ’em up, Miss.”
The other day in an English court a gentle-
man of colour was asked whether he was not the
father of a certain child. “Well,” replied he,
“ perhaps so, to a certain extent.”

A COWBOY’S TOOTHACHE.
FACING A DENTIST FOOLISHLY. HOW SUFFERING
COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.
Col. Metcalf, of Denver, Colo., U.S.A., was
once a cowboy, and tells a good story. “The
winter of 1831,” he says, “ was a hard one, and I
never saw anything like the rain that spring.
When June came we were truly a drowned-out
set. I never was so worn out. I made up my
mind to go to Denver. I hit upon the toothache
for an excuse. My employer was at the home
ranch far away, as I thought; and so having
pressed my excuse on the boys I started. I got to
Denver in the morning. After breakfast I lighted
a cigar and stood on the steps of the hotel, and
standing there came face to face with my em-
ployer. I whipped out my handkerchief, and
whipped it up to my cheek. ‘ Toothache —terrible,’
I murmured. ‘ Toothache, eh !’ he said, looking
at me keenly, ‘come with me and have it out.’ I
hadn’t the courage to say a word, and followed
him meekly round to the office of the dentist. I
sat down in the chair in a' state of utter colapse ;
pointed out a back Loth, and groaned ‘Pull it.’
The dentist had hard work to get that tooth out,
for it was one of the best teeth a man ever had. I
had to pay two dollars for the operation too, and
when the tooth was out, and tbe dentist bad
soothed my wounded jaw, my employer took me
down to the station and saw mo off on the next
train for Kit Carson, bound for the camp. I never
dared to tell any of the boys how I got beaten at
my game.”
To lose a good, sound molar in that sort of
fashion was simply stupid cowardice. Any sort
of quick-witted man would have spoken of St.
Jacobs Oil, which everybody knows to be an
absolute cure for the footbaohe , and for all kinds
or any kind of ache or pain. How easy then, if
ho must fib, to say that he had come to town to
get the great remedy, -and he would have
been believed. Thousands testify to its efficacy,
but one or two instances will suffice to | rove
it. The Hon. Billy Flint, Life Senator, Parlia-
ment, Dominion of Can ala, says :—“ It
acted like a charm in the cure of face neu-
ralgia arising from a defective tooth.” Mr.
Edward Walters, 87 Bourke-street, West Mel-
bourne, writes, “ That members of his family have
used it most effectually for toothache.” Mr. H.
If. Hoermanee. Lawrenceburgh, Ind., U.S.A.,
August 17, 18S8, states that he suffered with
toothache for two days. “I tried,’ he says, “St.
Jacobs Oil, and it cured me immediately, and
there has been no return of pain.” A most re-
markable cute was that of Mr. Samuel B. Shiplor,
Paragon, Ind., July 30, 1888, “I suffered,” he
says, “with pain in my head from sunstroke for
twenty-two years, and was cured by St. Jacobs
Oil; no return of pain in four years!”
"THE GREATEST GOOD TO THE
GREATEST NUMBER."
To achieve the object comprised in the above
words is conceded, to be the acme of practical
ph lantropy, and we claim the proud distinction
of having attaii e I it by the production of the
Waterbury Watch. In the first place a reliable
time keeper is a necessity (and reliable the
Waterbury undoubtedly is, parexcellence): and
secondly, which is quite as much to the point, it is
offered at a price which is within the means of the
million.
This sta ! eme.it 4s verified in a marked manner
by the follownitr letter received from the Rev.
Ditton Bronson, 12, Somerset-street, Boston.
He writes ; “ I desire to give unsolicited tes-
timonials to the excellence of your watches, and
to say that you have done a very great, service to
mankind. I have carried a Waterbury Watch for
three years. It has kept exact time, and appears
as good as the day I bought it. My conscience is
clear, because I can use the extra lOOdok, which
an expensive watch would have cost, to do good
with. I would advise my clerical brethren to buy
Waterburys, and give the balance to the widows
and fatherless. I would not exchange my Water-
bury for any 50dol. watch made, for my own use.
If it is stolen I can get another, and for time it is
as good as I could desire. Accept my sincere
thanks for so great a blessing put within reach of
the boys and the poor.”
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Waterbury Watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never constitutes itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company’s Repair Depot, 5G Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost, rang-
ing according to the extent of damage, from 6d.
to 2s. (id., bub never exceeding the latter amount
unless by mutual consent. The genuine Water-
bury may be obtained from any respectable store-
keeper or dealer. Price, series “E” (the old
favourite), 13s. 6d. ; series “J” or ‘ L ” (tho
new marvels), with enamelled dials, 22s. 6d. each.

A Street Pull of Ghosts.
Dear Bulletin, —John Basson Humffray,
whose right to mine and to do every other
mundane thing has just been called in by
the Boss Government, was for some time a
resident in Portland-street, Richmond (Vic.).
Portland-street is a cul-de-sac opening into
Rowena Parade, at a spot directly opposite to th®
house formerly tenanted by Peter Lalor, and
which was first occupied by the latter a few
months prior to Humffray’s return to Ballarat to
live. On fine days it is the pleasantest of stroll s
from Rowena Parade to Melbourne, the path
being through Richmond Park and Fitzroy
Gardens, and both Lalor and Humffray would
weather permitting, walk as often to the city as
’bus it or tram it. But they would never
go in company —Lalor has often been seen to
pass down the west side of the street, while
Humffray. walking in the same direction, was
on the other. On at least one occasion the old
Ballarat warrior met Humffray—who, being oniy
a “moral-suasion” man, cleared out of Eureka
Stockade the night before the military attack—at
the turnstile leading into the Park, then called
the Paddock. Neither would speak, neither
give precedence to the other—they simply
glared, each with a hand on the turnstile.
The situation lasted for a moment, and then
Lalor turned from the entrance-gate and got
through the adjacent panel of the two-rail fence.
Humffray was not to be outdone—he would show
Lalor he, too, could be independent of the turn-
stile, so, though he was gouty and bulky, he got
over the panel on the other side. When safely
landed inside the fence, he looked at Lalor and
Lalor looked at him. Both burst out laughing,
but still neither would speak, nor did they speak
for years after.
* * *
Humffray was once so hard down in his
luck that he was reduced to fossicking at Fiery
Creek, now Beaufort (Vic.). It was a local saying
at the Creek that “every pillar carried a nugget,”
the conventional English of the maxim being that
the country was so rich that in every upright of
earth left to sustain the roofs of the drives —it was
too much trouble to timber thoroughly in those
days—nuggetty gold would be found. Humffray
believed in the saying, and tackled a deserted
claim, beginning with the innermost pillar of
a gallery. The maxim was false as to four pillars
into which, at imminent risk to himself, he drove
his pick, for they collapsed and part of the roof
with them without yielding him a speck. Upon
the fifth column, however, a few yards from the
shaft, and his last hope, he made a desperate
onslaught, and he had barely time to pick up a
fifty-pound nugget and get to the shaft before the
whole caved in ? No—it was only a twelve-ounce
lump, and the pillar was standing ten years later.
# # #
Rowena Parade, Richmond (Vic.), men-
tioned above, has, with its extensive Vauoluse, by
the way, had a whole host of more or less notables
living in it at one time or another. Peter Lalor
and J. B. Humffray were two only of the legis-
lators who pitched their tents on its lines. There
was a M.P. for Richmond, who, being pious,
a church-elder, and a secretary of a building
society, set an example which has since been
generally followed, by bolting with the associated
funds to Callao; and there was D. S, Campbell,
who, in addition to many another good service
unostentatiously rendered to his province, deserves
perpetual remembrance as being the first Vic-
torian to plank down a hundred guineas to
the Anti-Transportation League, thereby origi-
nating the “ Hundred Guinea ” Fund, with-
out which the Rev. John West and his
colleagues of the League would have gone bank-
rupt. A certain judge lived at one end at the time
he committed the faux pas of—well, falling hotly
in love (in his old age) with a girl whom he almost
instantly married. The marriage—not the faux pas
—brought down upon him the anathema of Society
and the Church, as Dean Macartney will
remember; and at the other resided a public man
whom the judge, in his young and pre-judicial
days, once defended on a criminal charge—unsuc-
cessfully. The house in which Lalor resided was
built by Mr. Politz, a venerable Hungarian Jew
who had been “out” with Kossuth, and had
enjoyed the dolce-far-niente in a Tyrolese gaol,
with an Austrian for governor. W. IT. Handheld,
erstwhile bowler of “grubbers” and perennial
autocrat of the Education Department, here
erected, ages ago, altars to his Lares and Penates,
and, in the paddock adjoining his cottage, has
often been the recipient of jeering consolations
from a crowd of small boys seated on his fence as
he retired bowled for a “duck” by his young
daughter, who, at the age of nine, could trundle
a better round-arm ball than her dad a grubber.
“ Sammy ” lies, beloved of two generations
of Argus people, and known to all Melbourne as
the queer, dwarfish, but obliging messenger of the
bis: journal, and to a few scholars as a splendid
“Gr/cian,” lived in the street for thirty years,
and one of Sammy’s bosses, F. W. Haddon, who
hulks in the editorial chair, built his first bower
of bliss just inside of Vauoluse. Opposite Sammy’s
house lived a man who had ridden in the first
train from Manchester to Liverpool, and who saw
William Huskisson killed, and who himself did
no inconsiderable work for the public : while, a
few doors lower down, Charles Whitehead, bril-
liant and ill-fated author, who introduced Charles
Dickens to the publishing firm of Chapman and
Hall, lodged for a few weeks not many months
before he was carried from Melbourne Hospital to
an unmarked public grave. There was a curious
tale hanging about the spot of an orgy in which
he and “ Orion ” Horne figured. In this street,
too, starved—and died —the brother of a living
Australian bishop. The man who died was a
mass of erudition, carried loads of learned lumber
in his head, wrote and published a magnificent
book which nobody would buy, couldn’t earn six-
pence to save his life, and was buried by subscrip-
tion, to which his lordship contributed the sum
of one pound. And—in short, the faded, shabby
old Rowena Parade is as full of ghosts as any
street can well be in the young Australias.

The Dodo and Queen Bittern.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When the Dodo first came to Bittern Plains, was
before we whalers knew the mysteries of the pan-
nikin and the use of a double set of nose-bags,
That Dodo is extinct, the last having been
boomeranged three thousand years ago and sent
to Pharoah of Egypt. But another Dodo now
lives, and I shall tell you how she got the name.
Bittern Plains is a ten-mile block cut off from
old Thomson’s run and sold some fifteen years
ago. The purchaser was one Shakerley, a gentle-
man of uncertain and feeble health, but possessing
a better-half whose energy and constitution were
sufficient for both, and who, after life’s fitful fever
■ended for Shakerley, was left a youngish-looking
and robust widow. Her looks, as regards beauty,
are still subject of disputation and blasphemy. A
■change came over the routine at Bittern Plains
when Mrs. S. took full charge. She was childless
■and terribly energetic. In sooth, Mrs. S. is the
best station manager in Riverina. Bittern Plains
is a model homestead. The huts are dressed, the
stables aligned, and the stacks paraded in open
column. Any federated toy soldier will under
stand these expressions. Even the pig-styes are
in direct echelon and why should they not, for
did they not contain Martha and Mary, each of
them twenty pounds’ worth of sow, and doubtless
the squeakers are called Lazarus and Joseph, or,
perhaps, Rahab and Jezebel, Nicodemus and
Agrippa.
Now, this lady—and that she is a lady anyone
who has seen her letters can swear—having drilled
Bittern Plains into shape and made a paying con-
cern out of a swamp, determined to take a well-
earned rest by letting the station for five years.
During this spell her residence would be a free
selection of her own where it is compulsory to do
her time, in the old hands’ lingo. Before calling
for tenders she invited a niece, whom she had
never seen, to stay a week or two with her.
May heaven, if heaven is love, send blessings and
plenty more nieces on the DowageV, for bringing
light and joy and sunshine to a barren district
(barren of beauty and youth).
Here I must tell you that the ordinary wicked
and irreverent traveller had long christened the
old lady “Queen Bittern.” I fancy the sound
reminded them of her strident voice and merci-
less abuse, for Mrs. Shakerley lias a temper and a
will. Simultaneously with the arrival of the
niece, Miss Tigerly, came an interviewer for Mrs.
S. He wanted to look at the run and make an
offer. Out came old Blinker in the one-horse
shay, and the run was inspected, approved, and
let on a five years’ lease to Mr. Lonehand.
There is no doubt that . Queen Bittern set her
cap at Lonehand. It would not have been a good
match, for a man may not marry his grandmother.
Just then it occurred to the old young lady and
the new lessee that Miss Tigerly was confoundedly
good-looking. I, myself, shared and do share
their opinion. I had often seen her before. She
won the skating prize at Dubamble, and rode the
winner of the ladies’ hacks at the Barwon
Blastural and Horridcultural Show. And so-and-
so. It was love.
The Queen tried hard to keep the young ones
apart but failed. So she determined to pack
off her niece before the delivery of the
station. She called the whole proceedings dis-
graceful, and hinted that Miss Tigerly was a
designing minx, and that old Mr. Lonehand
would accuse her, Mrs. S., of match-making.
Poor old dowager, you can’t dam the torrent of
love—you can only damn it.
And now Miss Tigerly has become Mrs. Lone-
hand, and the “whalers” call her the Queen of
the Plains, and Joe the Marine has proclaimed
the late Majesty extinct and named her the Dodo.
The Dodo is in great grief—she loves pigs. The
Queen hates them. Twice has Mr. Lonehand
impounded Martha and Mary and threatened to
shoot them. Mrs. Lonehand does not forget her
aunt’s attempt to stop her marriage. She makes
her time her calls at fashionable hours and speaks
of her as a selector on the run, and charges ten
shillings for a sheep, and has blocked the short-cut
to the selection.

Diana, silvern, bathed
Rare flowers in tender sheen
The faintest zephyr swathed
The day-blooms folded e’en.
The tiny streamlet dashed
In wreaths and foamy churns ;
The silv’ry fountain splashed
O’er lilies and o’er ferns.
Deep in a fragrant bower
Two youthful souls drank in
The glories of the hour,
The glories of the scene.
All hid in his left hand
Her right confiding lay ;
Each heart did understand
The other, rich as May.
Long held they silent gaze
On that entrancing vi w ;
Nor vainly offered praise
Of empty words thereto.
Long was the raptured eye
Fixed on the beauteous show ;
At length, with heavy sigh,
’Twas thus she murmured low :
“ Beloved, my hand unclasp !
Though ! tis L r ever thine,
Yet now forego thy grasp
Awhile, thou youth divine —
“ Nay, nay, that frown forbear,
And scorn me not, adored ;
But my distresses share,
My own, my bosom’s lord.
“ Though an imperial moon
Begems a verdure bright;
Though Nature seems to swoon
In floods of perfumed light;
“ Though pours the nightingale
His passion to the rose,
I want —ah, piteous tale !
I want to blow my nose.”

A man convicted of a small theft is about to
be sentenced. He looks very slid and hopeless,
and the court is much moved by his contrite
appearance. “Have you ever been sentenced to
imprisonment?” asks the judge. “Never, never!”
exclaims the prisoner, bursting into teais. “Don't
cry, don't cry,” says the judge, consolingly; “you're
going to be, now !”
The depth of grovel to which English
journals sink is incredible, as, for example, in the
last number of the World, where Yates solemnly
contradicts a rumour, by another “ society ”
organ, that Queen Victoria is taking her own bed
with her to Florence, for, says Yates, he has the
best authority for stating that the Queen left at
Florence the bed she took there in 1888 ! Was he
under it, or what ?
Miss Jessie Playfair, who, her father being
a widower, officiated as Mayoress of Sydney
during his term of office, was recently married
at St. John’s, Darlinghurst, to Mr. Frank B.
Walker, son of Mr. P. B. Walker, of Sydney.
The bride wore cream foulard with satin stripe,
and trimmed with Maltese lace shade. She
carried a beautiful bouquet of white flowers.
There were two bridesmaids, and the honeymoon
is being spent at Maitland.

where the officials talked affably to the corpse,
and were surprised that his remains did not
respond. At the end of the journey the deceased
handed over the letters as usual, and had a drink,
and collected his salary, before anybody had time
to discover that he was dead. This last item is
not in the bill, but we put it in ourselves to give
an air < f verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and
unconvincing narrative.

0. C. Kingston, M.L.A. and ex-Attorney-
General of South Australia, is Australian-born,
and one of the sons of the late Sir G. S. Kingston,
who was, before the days of “ Gentleman ”
Ross, Speaker of the S.A. Legislative Assembly
and G.O.M. of that colony. The Kingston
Brothers have frequently been cited by finical
“ sassiety ” as peculiar, and the vagaries of one
of them, co’loquially known as “Patsy,” though
that is not his name, were always greedily
seized by cold-blooded Respectability as the
occasion for scorn and cruel merriment, though
his misfortune was due to a physical accident
operating severely on an excitable temperament.
“ Charley,” the subject of this par., has displayed
resolute manliness in every position which he
has been called upon to till, though his
simplicity of personal ideal has been con-
sidered a fair butt for the shoddyocracy As
a footballer, this six-footer (or thereabouts,
though he looks small alongside the enormous
Playford, with whom he has been perambulating
Sydney blocks lately) was a perfect terror. As a
lawyer, he was clever. As a volunteer citizen-
soldier, he was unique. He exhibited his own
strong disgust at the abominations of military
caste by refusing to be “commissioned” as an
“ officer,” but recruited as a private and went
honestly through his drill until, he achieved the
grades of “full private,” “corporal,” &c. : arid
not all the unhallowed jeers of small souls
could move him from the dead routine
of rising by pure merit. This is the
man who by invitation addressed the N.S.
Wales Trades and Labour Council last week,
and had many kind words to giv.e unionism arid
struggling labour. He told them that they had
gained “increased respect with their increased
strength; ” he advised them to proceed warily
within legal lines; and explained to them the
principles of the measure he had drafted for the
8. A. Parliament, with a view to deal with strikes
and lockouts by a public tribunal. He encouraged
the Labour Electoral League to proceed with its
agitation for one-man-one-vote, and to work for
the Eight-hour Bill by instalments, first making
the Eight-hour system compulsory in all Govern-
ment departments and Government contracts, as
in South Australia. He is favourable to the
postal voting system for shearers, seamen and
other voters who are perforce absent from their
homes on election days ; to the abolition of money
deposits by candidates; and to a tax on unim-
proved land-values. With Sir S. W. Griffith, of
Queensland, and A. J. Clark, of Tasmania, C. 0.
Kingston drafted the rough skeleton of the Federal
Constitution Bill now before Convention.
The barbarous Chinese Judges torture an
accused person until he confesses his guilt {of an
alleged offence. r ihe barbarous Australian judicial
system coerces dissentient juries by locking them
up till they do agree. The governing principle is
the same—brute force; only the incidence and
degree of brutality differ.

A Midsummer Might’s
Idyll,
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a dejected-looking little town of the aeons,
tomed Queensland pattern, situate some 40 miles
or more up a hot muddy river that wound back
and forward, and back again, and round about;
as no river ever wound and serpentined before'
For eleven weary hours wo had been crawling in a
steamboat over the surface of this stream
even the shadow of it in the darkness became a
weariness to the eye, and as we went along I had
tramped monotonously about the deck, and won-
dered whether my legs- would not presently get
w#rn off right up to my stomach through sheer
exertion and disgust. There was nothing to be
heard except the gurgle and swish of the thick,
turbid water and the asthmatic snort of the steam*
pipe, and nothing to be seen except no ,v and then
the dusky image of a bald and naked stump on
the bank, and nothing to speculate about except
the chance of climbing safely over the next snag>
and the dim probability of crowding successfully
l ound the next corner, for the river was low, and,
as a consequence, it was even a shade more
angular than usual. Even a bird flying across it
would be likely to lose its way and find it-elf back
on the shore it started from, and whether there
was only one shore altogether, or whether there
were two, and both of them were the other one, I
never knew. Generally, we seemed to be plunging
Wl .th a strange sough and groan into the very
middle of a dense black shadow that rose up like
?! v jall in front of us, and then just as we touched
it the vessel would fly off at a tangent and make
burst for the bank, and when it got there
the bank would somehow prove to be absent, and
we would puff unconcernedly over a stretch of
dead black water until it was time to make anothc r
and bolt madly for a tree standing out on
the extreme end of a low headland. But the tree
would also melt away mysteriously, and the head-
tand would vanish, and after that all would go
well till we started to perform some more calis-
thenics, and make a fresh jump for destruction.
hen vve would steer uneasily round some more
corners, and the escape-pipe would blow forth a
Weolslirill derision, and next we would graze a
6 loaded with pumpkins, and the captain
would blaspheme from the deck and ask us, with
n anguished cry, where we supposed we were
to. No one took any notice of him, how-
,® r 5 the captain of a ketch doesn’t amount to
anything.
The steamer was old and slow, and gave forth
nornd and indescribable odour. The saloon
as small, and the cabins were stuffy. The bath-
use was on deck, but for some unexplained
ason when the crew started to wash the deck
- J r.V7u ter *' su PP l y ’ n the bath immediately gave out,
the crew washed the deck incessantly. I had
i on -°, chow-passenger, and she was a stout
.< 7 Wlt n a dog attached to a short string. Un-
arwi U ? ately ’ t r °d on the dog early in the voyage,
dric.fi m that moment the fount of sympathy
„ . U .P> ail d I found myself alone, and my only
aiumg amusement consisted in gazing at the
monotonous bank, and getting out of the path of
the cook when that artizan in boiled mutton fled
along the deck with a large dish in his hand. But
there was no thrill in either of these dissipations,
.and so a feeling of deep and holy joy filled my
soul when our vessel coughed wearily up to a
broken wharf, and I scrambled ashore.
There was a steep clay bank behind the wharf,
and on top of it the last earthly possibility in the
way of a hotel loomed out against the stars.
It seemed to have been budt mainly of old boards
and mud and disused gin-cases, but the materials
could not be very well defined in the darkne'ss—
there was merely a prevailing aspect of jaggedness
that belonged to no recognised order ot architec-
ture, and beyond it there was a hazy and unde-
fined street which appeared to have fallen down
dead while only half-grown. The street ran
parallel to the river, and consequently there was
mud at one side and real estate at the other—
the mud beingmuch the more numerous of the two.
As for the population, it had only one visible
representative—-a small, fat, old man, who stood
at the door of tire hotel with a candle in a
bottle, awaiting the course of events. He was a
hideously confidential old man, too, and when he
had conducted me into a bedroom with two win-
dows and one solitary chair and a stuffed oat in it,
he leaned up against the wall and conversed
affably, while I hung my hat on the bedpost and
listened, with one boot in my hand and my senses
buried in partial oblivion.
His daughter had eloped that morning, it ap-
peared, with a gentleman in the paving-stone and
road-repairing industry, and his wife had been
upset in her finer feelings and had gone to bed.
She had remained there all day, and it had been
found necessary to apply stimulants to keep her
up, and in consequence of this disaster lie had
been compelled to run the hotel himself, and wash
lip the dishes, and perform other menial duties.
For his own part, he had never looked with a
favourable eye on the gentleman who repaired
roads, and he was inclined to think that, as a
son-in-law, he would prove a failure. He had a
dull, far-away sound as he related these circum-
stances, and a thick haze seemed to gather round
him, and by-and-by his sentences appeared to fall
to pieces, and I fell asleep in a sitting position
and dreamed that his voice was a rushing river
somewhere —and then I awoke with a sudden
wrench which seemed to tear all my joints
asunder, and found him still talking. The candle
had burnt low in the bottle, and the grease was
guttering on the floor, and he had evidently got
to the end of the original subject, for he was
relating the incidents connected with a gold rush,
or a shearing riot, or something of the sort. I
suggested briefly that I was going to bed, and he
faded out of the door, and came back with a fresh
candle, and faded again, and came back once
more to supply some further information, and
then he faded away for the third time, and I
rushed at the door and locked it to keep him out.
After a while he returned and made a frantic
struggle to get into the room, but, failing in this,
he retired with a heavy sigh and went to bed.
The little town was unutterably still. There
was a ripple on the water, but it was merely the
impalpable ghost of an absent sound, and was
hardly more definite than the footsteps of the
moonlight as it began to steal feebly through the
window. But despite the stillness and my own
weariness I could only be still and curse inwardly,
and accumulate cramps. But by-and-bye I began
to drift into that undefinable condition when n
man is always doing something and never getting
to the bottom, or is filled with the tail-end of a
thousand brilliant ideas and loses them all the
next instant, and probably I might have dropped
off only the afflicted landlady suddenly went into
hysterics over her lost daughter and filled the
building with screams and disjointed observations.
Probably her husband emptied a water-jug over
her, for she dropped screaming and took to exe-
crating instead. She was evidently in the next
room, and it was also evident that she was a large
brawny female, for 1 heard her come out of bed
with a thud, and then there .came a series of
hollow reverberations as she plunged and gambolled
about on the floor. The next moment a window
opened, and a long white figure galloped along
the unsafe and treacherous-looking balcony which
fronted the building. Another figure, a short,
fat one, appeared in the moonlight a second
later and went by at a resolute trot carry-
ing its pants in one hand and a hat in the
other, and presently a wild-iookingobject also flew
by, throwing its limb? out in great, loose strides,
and uttering Irish ejaculations of surprise.
There was an excited argument at the other end
of the balcony, and the hysterical female seemed
to make several efforts to throw herself over into
the street, but at length she became pacified, and
■returned in a faint and limp condition—in other
words, her husband trailed her along in a series
of short jumps, and puffed a good deal under the
exertion. He wore his hat over one ear this time,
and carried his pants in his teeth. The third in-
dividual did not assist, but as the landlord jumped
his insensible prey back through the window that
fainting lady partially woke up and gave her fol-
lower notice to quit the house in the morning.
The place grew quiet again after tins—all
except a dog-'and-goat fight in the street below.
One of the combatants gave away most of
his ear in the course of this latter difficulty,
and the other had his tail wrecked. Finally, they
both departed in a cloud of dust, and escaped over
the horizon, and' left silence behind them, and I
resolved to go back to bed again, and fall asleep.
The bed was not favourable, however. It seemed
to be stuffed with bricks and coal, and it described
such an angle to the horizon that I had to brace
my feet against the lower .end of it in order to
keep my position. This is a hard world, and if
my feet slipped it was evident I would fall out on
to one of the hardest parts’of it. When I realised
this fact I sat up and made a remark—a long, in-
furiated remark which was unfit to print, and
while I was making it the bed-clothes slipped on
to the floor, and when I hauled them up again
they were tied in a hard knot, so that when I
tried to get into them I merely came out again at
the other end. Then I looked for the candle with
a view to putting things right once for all, and I
found it so suddenly that I filled my eye with
grease and wick, and in my anguish I prayed that
the eleven devils which howl for over round Judas
Iscariot might trample on the woman who made
the bed and on all her descendants till they be-
came extinct.
It was just at this moment that I noticed some-
one pounding ceaselessly at the front door, and
when I listened intently I became aware that
there was someone in tears on the footpath be-
low. I opened the window and implored her in
a loud voice to go home—to go and sleep on the
fence—to go to bed—to go to Gehenna if she pre-
ferred it, but, anyhow, to keep quiet and go, but
as she still wept and pounded I went out on the
balcony and considered the situation with my un-
greased eye.
There was a girl below with a carpet-bag and a
hat-box, and she was wailing bitterly and rush-
ing at the door with her feet. Sometimes she
jumped at it with both feet and at others she took
running kicks with only one, and then between
these exercises she would put her inflamed eye to
the keyhole and pray for admittance. Evidently
she was,in dire distress of some kind, and for a
while I was in doubt whether to he a father to
her or whether to look at the matter from a purely
selfish standpoint and empty the contents of the
water-jug over the balcony. While I was debat-
ing this point she sat down in the road and threat-
ened to grow hysterical, and then I suddenly gave
way to a sympathetic mood and addressed her.
“ Here,” 1 shouted, “for heaven’s sake stop
that infernal row, and go away.”
“ Let me in,” she responded.
“ I can’t,” I answered briefly, “ It isn’t my
hotel, and anyhow I’m in full-dress. Besides, I
don’t know where the door is, and I want to go
to sleep, and I wouldn’t let you in anyhow. What
on earth are you weeping in the street with a
carpet-bag for ? ”
Apparently this aggravated her, for she began
to bang the door with stones, and then I put my
head in at the window of the next room, and
roused the landlord, and informed him that an
insane girl was reducing his house to general
smash. He came out with a gun, just in time to
find his daughter breaking the bar-window with
road-metal. It was evidently an hysterical out-
burst on her part, for when he hailed her with
considerable strong language she broke down
miserably in the gutter— and explained.
She was the individual who eloped that morn-
ing, and she had come back to report that
marriage had been a failure. The bridegroom had
taken her home, and had straightway gone out
and got drunk, and was now sleeping in the ash-
barrel at the back-door, and consequently she had
packed her carpet-bag and her hat-box, and run
for the old public-house in a repentant mood. As
there was evidently nothing else to be done the
indignant parent opened the door and threw the
carpet-bag and the hat-box into the passage.
Also, he admonished his daughter severely on the
stairs, and, judging from sundry sounds that
reached me, that young lady went to bed in a
repentant mood.
Then I went to bed also, and lay down with the
clothes rolled up in a hard ball on my chest, and
fell asleep till the steamer at the wharf com-
menced to blow its whistle with a melancholy
cadence that broke oft’ into shrieks and variations
at intervals, and filled the town with a solemn
note of woe, and at the same moment a rooster
eight feet high began to offer a few remarks in the
back-yard, and a man went by shoving a barrow
with an ungreased wheel. I sat up in bed, and
consigned the rooster, and the wheelbarrow, and
the distracted mother in the next room, and the
broken-hearted daughter with the carpet-bag to
all the infernal gods, and then I began to smoke.
It was rather difficult work, owing to the extreme
steepness of the bed, and I had to hold my head
down with both feet in order to preserve my
equilibrium, but I got on pretty well for a while,
and then
Evidently the old woman was awake, and
mourning for her absent child, and evidently also
the stern male parent with the gun was consoling
her with the information that the joy and sun-
shine of their domestic hearth had rushed home
through the dust with her clothes in both hands,
and was now sleeping in a contrite mood in the
back-room. There was a smothered scream to
begin with, and I could hear the fond mother get

out of bed with a “woosh !” and scuttle on two
ponderous naked feet down a passage, and into
the apartment on the other side of mine. Then I
recognised that a crisis was at hand, and I grasped
the floor with both hands, for it was certain that
this explosive ancestor would either weep the
roof off with tears of joy, or else would spank her
prodigal daughter there and then, and in either
case I expected the house to totter on its founda-
tions. As it happened, she did both, but it only
accelerated the row in a very small degree, and I
felt comparatively resigned—on the floor. There
was a reconciliation first of all, and the young
wife rested her tired head on her parent’s capaci-
ous bosom and forgot her woes—the bosom was
hollow, and the head seemed to be uncommonly
hard, and I could hear the concussion as they
came together; and when the first pathos of the
scene was over, the mother evidently remembered
her offspring’s shortcomings, and hit her on both
ears with a dishcloth or some similar weapon.
But presently they became reconciled again and
went to sleep in each other’s arms, and the old
prosaic father shored placidly in the other room,
and there was a great calm and oblivion that
lasted till long after daybreak. For a while I sat
and looked at the lights and shadows which the
moon described on the mountains beyond the
river, but after a while the mountains grew hazy
and indistinct, and the shadows commenced to
dance a fantastic waltz before my eyes, and next
I put the wrong end of my pipe in my mouth,
and came back to consciousness just as I had
swallowed half a pint of ashes. I coughed up
most of the consignment, and ate the rest, and
then I retired once more, with my head at the
lower end cf the bed and my feet up in the air,
and slept a dreamless sleep.
When I awoke at last someone was ringing a
breakfast-bell at the keyhole, and there was over
a quart of water in my upper ear. A tropical
thunderstorm was raging outside, and a cooling
stream of rain descended through the roof just
above my head, while another cataract came
down in a refreshing manner on my feet. Also
the room was nearly afloat, so I dressed hurriedly
in the passage. A wild, confused argument was
in progress downstairs, for the bridegroom of
yesterday had come along at an early hour to
demand his wife, and was vociferating in the bar.
The storm, it appeared, had aroused him from his
placid slumbers in the barrel at the back-door, and
he had crawled into bis home to find it abandoned
and desolate, and after that sundry inquiries in
various directions elicited the information that the
angel of his fireless hearth had been seen in a state
of distraction outside her father’s public-house in
the early hours of the morning. He demanded
her immediate return, but the young lady
remained in bed and sent down a message that for
the future they must look upon each other as
strangers, and the landlord sat on a keg in a
corner and leaned his fat and harassed head
against the wall, and the landlady stood with a
stony glare behind the bar, and professed to regard
the visitor as a perfect stranger who had dropped
in by accident in search of refreshment. This was
the situation at nine o’clock, bub at half-past nine
the bride came downstairs and threw herself into
her husband’s arms;’and at a quarter to ten
he was drinking affably along with his father-in-
law, and at ten o’clock the landlady cast them
both off in a tragic manner, and renounced them
for ever. Viewed by daylight I discovered that
the heroine was an exceedingly long girl of about
seventeen, with a flame-coloured head and a
nervous wink in the left eye.
When they were gone the bereaved mother pro-
ceeded, with an air of Roman fortitude, to count
the horn-handled two-pronged forks and other
portable articles. Whether they were all there
or not I never heard.
TITUS SALT.
“His Masterpiece.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
‘•Greenhide Billy” was a stockman on a
Clarence River cattle-station and admittedly the
biggest liar in the district. He had been for many
years pioneering in the Northern Territory, the
other side of the sun-down—a regular “ furthest-
out man ’’—and this assured his reputation among
station-hands who award rank according to amount
of experience. Young men who have always hung
around the home localities, doing a job of shearing
here or a turn at horsebreaking there, look with
reverence on the Riverine or Macquarie-River
shearers who come in with tales of runs where
they have 300,000 acres of freehold land and shear
250,000 sheep, and these again pale their ineffec-
tual fives before the glory of the Northern Territory
man who has all-comers on toast, because no one
can contradict him or check his figures, except
someone from the same locality. When two such
meet, however, they are not fools enough to cut
down quotations and spoil the market; no, they
mutually lie in support of each other, and make
all other bushmen feel mean and pitiful and inex-
perienced.
Sometimes a youngster would timidly ask
Greenhide Billy about the (to him) terra incognita :
“What soi’t of a place is it, Billy—how big are
the properties ? How many acres had you in the
place you were on ?”-
“Acres be d d !” Billy would scornfully
reply; “hear him talking about acres! D’ye
think we were blanked cockatoo selectors ! Out
there we reckon country by the hundred miles.
You orter say, ‘How many thousand miles of
country ?’ and then I’d understand you.”
Furthermore, according to Billy, they reckoned
the rainfall in the Territory by yards, not inches ;
he had seen blackfellows who could jump at least
three inches higher than anyone else had ever seen
a blaekfellow jump, and every bushman has seen
or personally known a blaekfellow who could jump
over six feet. Billy had seen bigger droughts,
better country, fatter cattle, faster horses, and
cleverer dogs, than any other man on the Clarence
River. But one night when the rain was on the
roof, and the river was rising with a moaning
sound, and the men were gathered round the fire
in the hut smoking and staring at the coals, Billy
turned himself loose and gave us his masterpiece.
* * *
“ I was drovin’ with cattle from Hungry -
banbone to old Corlett’s station on the Bucka-
towndown River (Billy always started his stories
with some paralysing bush names.) We had a
thousand head of store-cattle, wild mountain-bred
wretches, they’d charge you on sight, and they
were that handy with their horns they could
skewer a mosquito. There was one or two one-
eyed ca f tle among ’em, and you know how a one-
eyed beast always keeps movin’ away from the
mob, pokin’ away out to the edge of them so as
they won’t git on his blind side; and then by
stirrin’ about he keeps the others restless. They
had been scared once or twice and stamped, and
gave us all we could do to keep them together ;
and it was wet and dark and thundering, and it
looked like a real bad night for us. It was my
watch, and I was on one side of the cattle, like it
might be here, with a small bit of a fire ; and my
mate, Barcoo Jim, lie was right opposite on the
other side of the cattle, and he had gone to sleep
under a log. The rest of the men were in the
camp fast asleep. Every now and again I’d get
on my horse and prowl round the cattle quiet like,
and they seemed to be settled down all right, and
I was sitting by my fire holding my horse and
drowsing, when all of a sudden a blessed ’possum
ran out from some saplings and scratched up a
little tree right alongside me. I was half-asleep,
I suppose, and was startled ; anyhow, never
thinking what I was doing, I picked up afirestick
out of the fire and flung it at the ’possum. Whoop!
Before you could say ‘Jack Robertson’ that
thousand head of cattle were on their feet, and
they made one wild, headlong, mad rush right
over the place where poor old Barcoo Jim was
sleeping. There was no time to hunt up materials
for the inquest; I had tc keep those cattle
together, so I sprang into the saddle, dashed the
spurs into the old horse, dropped my head on his
mane, and sent him as hard as he could leg it
through the scrub to get the lead of the cattle
and steady them. It was brigalow, and you know
what that is. You know how the brigalow grows,”
continued Bill, “saplings about as thick as a
man’s arm, and that close together a dog can’t
open his mouth to bark in ’em. Well, those cattle
swept through that scrub levelling it like as if it
had been cleared for a railway line. They cleared
a track a quarter of a mile wide, and smashed
every stick, stump, and sapling on it. Yon could
hear them roaring and their hoofs thundering and
the,scrub smashing three or four miles off. And
where was I? I was racing parallel with the
cattle, with my head down on the horse’s neck,
letting him pick his way through the scrub in the
pitchy darkness. This went on for about four
miles, then the cattle began to get winded, and I
dug into the old stookhorse with the spurs, and
got in front, and then began to crack the whip
and sing out, so as to steady them a little ; after
awhile they dropped slower and slower, and I
kept the whip going. I got them all together in
a patch of open country, and there I rode round
and round ’em all night till dayligh* - . And how
I wasn’t killed in the scrub, goodness only knows;
for a man couldn’t ride in the daylight where I
did in the dark. The cattle were all knocked
about—horns smashed, legs broken, ribs torn ;
but they were all there, every solitary head of
’em ; and as soon as the daylight broke I took
’em back to the camp—that is, all that could
travel, because a few broken-legged ones I had to
leave.”
# * *
Billy paused in his narrative. He knew
that some suggestions would be made, by way of
compromise, to tone down the awful strength of the
yarn, and he prepared himself accordingly. His
motto was “No surrender,” he never abated one
jot of his statements, and if anyone chose to
remark on them, he made them warmer and
stronger, and absolutely flattened out the in-
truder.
“ That was a wonderful bit of ridin’ you done,
Billy,” said one of the men at last, admiringly
“ It’s a wonder you wasn’t killed. I’spose your
clothes was pretty well tore off your back with
the scrub?”
“ Never touched a twig,” said Billy.
“ Ah !” faltered the inquirer, “then no doubt
you had a real ringin’ good stock-horse that could
take you through a scrub like that full-split in the
dark, and not hit you against anything.”
“No, lie wasn’t a good ’un,” said Billy decisively,
“ he was the worst horse in the camp, and terrible
awkward in the scrub he was, always failin’ down
on his knees ; and his neck was so short you could
sit far back on him and pull his ears.”
Here that interrogator retired hurt ; he gave
Billy best. Another took up the running after a
pause.
“How did your mate get on, Billy? I s’pose
ho was trampled to a mummy ! ”
“No,” said Billy, “he wasn’t hurt a bit. I
told you he was sleeping under the shelter of a
little log. Well, when these cattle rushed they
swept over that log a thousand strong ; and every
beast of that herd took the log in his stride and
just missed landing on Barcbo Jimmy by about
four inches. We saw the tracks where they had
cleared him in the night—and fancy that, Fa
thousand head of cattle to charge over a man in
the dark and just miss him by a hair’s breadth, as
you might say !”
The men waited a while and smoked, to let this
statement soak well into their systems ; at last
ope rallied and had a final try to get a suggestion
in somewhere.
“It’s a wonder, then, Billy,” he said, “that
your mate didn’t come after you and give you a
hand to steady the cattle.”
“Well, perhaps it was,” said Billy, “only that
there was a bigger wonder than that at the back
of it.”
“What was that ?”
“My mate never woke all through it.”
Then the men knocked the ashes out of their
pipes and went to bed.

time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-

Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrinmation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.

-.there still !”
The gay Inspector laughs.aloud as these few words
are said,
The Board agree that Mr. B. his land has for-
• feited.
“ Now call Miss 0.” Miss C. declares her bond
fides true,
For in her dwelling one may see a bed and bed-
clothes, too.
“ I sewed those clothes together,” says, the Bloke,
and, may I die,
But, four months afterwards, I found that bed
still ‘ apple-pie !’ ”
And, at recital of . his joke, the rude Inspector
roared,
And so Miss C., like Mr. 8., cried forfeit, and was
floored.
Take warning, then, oh ! D and E, and all the
alphabet,
Don’t underrate the risks you run, the treatment
you may get,
The hounds soon learn the fox’s tricks, and
Blokes who’re on the job
Are apt to lay a trap to test the residential nob.
With these few thoughts, we’ll close the doo-de-
dum of dummies’ tricks
That through our Land Laws seek to drive a
“ scbleinter ” coach-aud-six.
DIPSO.
Four soldiers stationed at Dum-Dum, a
suburb of Calcutta, on the hunt for liquor in the
dead of night, threw one Selim, whom they
dragged from his bed, into the tank and their
shot him as lie swam ashore. They were arrested
for murder, and the two who had not fired turned
Queen’s evidence, while several coloured men
swore positively to the ident ty of the other two.
Judge Norris directed the jury to acquit one man
named Bellow, but O’Hara was unanimously
found guilty and sentenced to death. The Leinster
Regiment thereupon threatened to revolt and
shoot every native they could find if their comrade
were hanged for killing a nigger, and so the case
was revised before a bench of five, when O’Hara
was acquitted. The natives are highly incensed,
and vow to get even.
Prince Napoleon, the “ Plon-PIon ” whose
death is cabled, was remarkable for at least three
achievements. Firstly, he shot a man dead some
20 years ago, was tried for the murder, and
acquitted on the ground that the other, one Victor
Noir, might also have meant shooting. Secondly,
he begat a son in whom the lineaments of Buona-
parte are so strikingly reproduced that he can, or
could, awhile back, be fixed up to look like the
ghost of the great Little Corporal. Thirdly, he
gave Napoleon III. the opportunity to say a
fairly smart thing. “You have nothing of the
First Napoleon about you,” complained Plon-
Plon, during one of their periodical rows. “Oh,
yes, I have: I have his relatives about me,”
responded Nap. the Third. The wheeze was
accepted as a fact when the Emperor spread it
abroad, and as both principals are now em-
balmed there is nobody left to swear that it wasn't
got off on the spur of the moment, but thought of
next day.
Some of the Premier Permanent Building
Society’s Balaclava (Vic.) properties were put up
at auction last week. For four villas, on each of
which the Society had lent £050, the highest bid
was £460 a-piece, the reserve being £500. Dow,
are you listening ?
Dr. George Ernest Morrison, who is
remembered in connection with New Guinea ex-
ploration of ’B3-’B4, has returned to the parental
roof at Geelong. Since he left Australia, about
six years back, he has graduated at Edinburgh
University, has held an important hospital ap-
pointment in Spain, and taken a Spanish diploma.
He has also wandered about in the States, the
West Indies and North Africa. He now yearns
.for another New Guinea boom. The most interest-
ing relic he has of that country is a native spear,
portions of which are still embedded in his manly
frame.
On the Melbourne Financial Exchange,
the question is, How does Goldbug stand ? Will
he still smirk around, and give his gorgeous
parties, while Mirams has gone to the gaol-wall,
and while there are even whispers about the
mighty Taylor, the man who peeled a £5O-note off
his chest when the plate came round ?
The unfortunate political scapegoat,
Reseigh Martin, journalist, sentenced to two
years’imprisonment for libelling Railway Com-
missioner Eddy, was recently removed from
Sydney to Maitland gaol, chained by wrist and
leg—by whose order/ oategoriod as a convict-
felon. Be it remembered that Martin was no
criminal against the community, but a mistaken
would-be reformer at worst, and that the brutality
now meted out to him seems envenomed with
political vindictiveness.
The Grand United Order of Vamoosing
Australian Bank-clerks, Unlimited, has, during

Mr. P. Lahitf, ‘a Wollongong man,- rn
sinking a prospecting shaft through hydraulic
limestone, since satisfactorily tested, came upon a
seam of coal. Water flooded him out, and he
applied to the N.S.W. Prospecting Board for
assistance to further prosecute his researches.
“In passing through limestone,”said the Board
in effect, “you have gone beyond the coal-mea-
sures, and therefore we can’t assist.” “But there
is the coal underneath the limestone,"was Lahiff’s
obstinate reply. “Oh, it can’t be; geology says
it can’t, and that settles it,” was the dogmatic
dictum of the Board. Lahitf applied to the
Minister for Mines, who “ didn’t feel just'fied,”
etc., evasively. Which is remindful of the en.
thusiasm with which the Department, some
months ago, assisted an influential syndi-
cate to look for coal a thousand or two
feet below the bed of Sydney harbour, and
would probably have been willing to subsidise
a proposal from the same syndicate to sink a shaft
in Uranus. The moral of all this is that geologists
have no final nor even safe knowledge of the
occurrence of minerals. Up North once, it
used to be geological gospel that gold couldn’t be
found in red granite formation, but the best gold
was found there through the accidental straying of
a digger’s “ old crock ” on to a red granite range.
Again, Mount Morgan ore was a knock-down con-
tradiction of old geological theories, and the same
surprises have frequently happened in connection
with'other mineral freaks in Nature's laboratory.
The N.S. Wales Prospecting Board has no call to
consider the occurrence of coal beneath limestone
a personal insult to itself.
“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal ,
Its the only paper which has a consistent and dis.
tindive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A. Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
Sy .den).
A United Australia and Protection again: I
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
'i lie Chinese.
Imperial Fed era t, i on.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers o:
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos.
sessos a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive‘paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It bad at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every' Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable faot—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is tlie one most frequently reinailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian ‘
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE. — One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. P. Kuoblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
J became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up Wood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
