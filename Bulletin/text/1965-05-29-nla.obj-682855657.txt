National Notebook
Crisis of Conscience
"T'or a play which was stopped by the
police in Rome and which led to
riots when it was performed elsewhere
in Europe and in the United States Rolf
Hochhuth’s “The Representative” (also
known as “The Deputy” and “The
Vicar”) looks like having a comparatively
quiet reception when it comes to Sydney.
A spokesman for the Catholic Church
in Sydney told us that he did not know
of any special concern within the church
at the play’s forthcoming production, and
added that at this stage there was not
likely to be any comment about it.
The Old Tote Theatre will present the
controversial play at the end of its pre-
sent season of the Restoration comedy
“The Country Wife”. It is hard to imag-
ine two more radically different produc-
tions.
As producer John Clark explained,
“The Representative” has two counter-
pointed themes one which deals with
the Nazi mentality and Nazi relations
generally with the Vatican and one which
deals with the personal dilemmas facing
Pope Pius XII. The Sydney production
will emphasise the personal dilemma
what Mr Clark calls Pius’ “crisis of con-
science”. Should he have been more out-
spoken in his protests against the Nazi's
extermination of the Jews?
Mr Clark said that this was what the
play was “fundamentally about”. It was,
he felt also, a play which had to be done.
With the author’s approval he has cut
his own version out of the original, which
in its unedited form would run for six
hours. The Old Tote's version will run
for about three. When we spoke to Mr
Clark auditions were still in progress and
he was unable to say who would be cast
as Pius, a role taken by Emlyn Williams
in the New York production.
Fighting Fit
/”Vne of the prizes for winning the
'“'“birthday ballot” is a full-scale medi-
cal check-up by courtesy of the Com-
monwealth of Australia. Potential
National Service trainees are currently
being examined to assess their fitness to
stand up to two years of service in the
Army.
Early results of the examination tend
to tarnish the image of Australian physi-
cal fitness. Rejections are running at
the rate of 30-40 per cent. It seems
that Australia’s 20-year-olds suffer from
a variety of disabling illnesses. Highest
on the list are joint injuries, whilst rheu-
matic heart disease is surprisingly fre-
quent.
The old “dodges” of flat feet, sugar in
the urine, and slightly defective vision
are no longer sufficient to get you out of
uniform. Flat feet, it seems, are in, and
so is rectifiable vision; sugar in the
urine earns a return visit and perhaps a
biochemical test. Medical examiners are
also surprised by the relatively high in-
cidence of heavy alcoholic intake, the
effects of which are noticeable even at
this early age.
Where is the Fun Factor?
’l3l7'e read with some fascination the
" " rundown on the fashionable life
overseas provided by the advertising
manager of Grace Bros, Sydney, Mr
John Simpson, and recorded by the “Sun-
Herald”.
On America, Mr Simpson is reported
as saying:
“Then there are the people out for
kicks. For example, you might over-
hear this kind of remark at a party: ‘Do
you take cheese on your camembert?’
“The question is asked to draw atten-
tion to the moment, to put spice into the
moment. It’s a fragment to be enjoyed
while it’s there.
“The American way of life is a study
of fragmentation, as Norman Mailer
said. Each fragment must be under-
stood individually.”
Returning home, Mr Simpson found
Australia “a little on the dull side”.
“We have all the ingredients for fun
living,” he told the “Sun-Herald”, “but
our Anglo-Saxon equanimity is getting
in the way. Where is the fun factor?
Where is the fun elegance? Where is the
cafe society, the casino life?”
Trade Winds
A lthea Tebbutt is a 38-year-old Eng-
* lishwoman, mother of two teenage
children a’schooling “at Home”, whd
lives in a rambling house set in a 10-acre
garden, 7000 ft. up, 20 miles out of
Nairobi. And it was with this picture
that we met her in Perth last week as
she ended a tour of Asia and Australia.
Mrs Tebbutt is a foundation member
and director of a £1,000,000 group of
14 East African publications owned by
the Aga Khan who uses them, she says,
to help unite Kenya’s racial groups and
to educate. She had joined the organisa-
tion through journalism and newspaper
photography and has been a representa-
tive in Africa (“a photographer’s dream-
land”) for Associated Press and several
London papers, including the Financial
Times.
Of Kenya she said: “No longer the
country of the Mau Mau, but a progres-
sive republic dedicated to overcoming
ignorance, poverty and disease, and doing
just that with incredible speed.” Of Prime
Minister Jomo Kenyatta: “A remarkable
man who has said he will take help from
anywhere in the world so long as there
are no political strings”. Of Western
"It's fragmented, friend, not fractured ."

Australia (most of her appointments had
been arranged by Charles Court’s Indus-
trial Development Department): “A State
that doesn't know its own strength, but
one I believe that will be among the
major commercial factors in the world
over the next 30 years. Half the world’s
population is in the grasp of the West
Australian market.”
But there was implied criticism as well.
She pointed out that the problems of
skilled labor had to be overcome if the
dreams were to be fulfilled. How? “Well,
we have seen in parts of Africa that it is
possible to integrate three races, for them
to live and work in complete harmony.”
Mrs Tebbutt’s mission in Australia was
mainly to see how commercially close
this country’s west coast and Africa’s
east coast could be, in view of the trade
vacuum caused by Kenya’s boycott of
South African imports. She suggested the
State Government should charter a ship
for this “one of those fast 10,000-ton
Scandinavian freighters. When the trade
builds up, as it would, soon the other
boys would be calling in.” This, of
course, would mean more Australian ad-
vertisement in her papers.
Freewheeling
TI/fiRAN Ogrin, foreign news editor of
“Ljubljanski Snevnik”, a 170,000
circulation daily in Ljubljana, Yugo-
slavia, stepped ashore here from Mes-
sageries Maritimes’ Oceania last week
He is on a world feature-writing tour
and will spend about a month in Aus-
tralia and see as much as possible. No
one met him and he had made no
arrangements or plans, because he likes
it that way.
He told us he was going to see some
of the bigger cities and then go bush.
He said he was not interested in politics
or hard news on this trip, and that he
wanted to gather his own impressions
in a completely unfettered and leisurely
way.
Ogrin has already started sending
material back to his newspaper for
weekly features. Apart from his own
language he speaks French, German,
English and Persian (he has just done
an exam in Persian literature towards
an imminent doctor’s degree), and he
has been travelling the world since 1944.
Spadework
A book just published by Angus and
1 Robertson must have involved more
genuine spadew'ork for the author than
any other recent Australian publication.
The book, “Annabella Boswell’s Jour-
nal", is the by-product of research done
by young Newcastle architect Richard
Ratcliffe.
He was just out of university when
he discovered, seven miles south -of Port
Macquarie, the ruins of the marsh-
surrounded mansion which had belonged
to Major Innes, the man who gave Glen
Innes its name. Sydney architect and
university lecturer Morton Herman en-
couraged him to study the old colonial
design.
It was not till seven years later that
he completed the excavation —down to
three feet in places—to trace the old
foundations and reproduce the plan.
The digging was only part of the back-
breaking task. The major’s wife had
been one of the people who introduced
lantana into Australia. It was 40 feet
high around the few walls and chimneys
that then remained. Another prolific
grower was the vicious Mysore thorn
which, according to Ratcliffe, “grabbed
you as you passed”. He also had to
contend with snakes, leeches and ticks.
With the help of a couple of old
photographs and drawings, Ratcliffe was
able to reproduce the elevations of the
old home for the book.
The house had been built in 1827, re-
mained with the Innes family till the
1850 s, and went to ruin after a bush-
fire swept through it in 1890. In 1839
Annabella, the niece of Major Innes,
came to spend nine years of her child-
hood in the house. That was in the hey-
day of the Innes family before the
major’s fortunes changed.
The major had earlier been com-
mandant in charge of convicts at Port
Macquarie and, later, police magistrate
at Newcastle.
Annabella, who had followed her
uncle to Newcastle, there married
Patrick Charles Douglas Boswell, mana-
ger of the Bank of New South Wales and
a distant relative of James Boswell, the
biographer of Dr Johnson. They later
went to Scotland where Annabella pub-
lished her diary so that her children
would know something of life in Aus-
tralia.
Ratcliffe came across a copy of the
diary in the records of the Hastings Dis-
trict Historical Society. The old man-
sion has now completely disappeared.
The destruction started by fire and con-
tinued by time has been completed by
looters and vandals.

Duke Tritton
VATe note with regret the death in
Sydney last week of Mr H. P.
“Duke” Tritton, the noted folk-singer
and collector of Australian songs and
stories. Mr Tritton was 78, and pre-
ceded by a couple of generations today’s
folk-singers, about many of whom he
may have had mixed feelings. His auto-
biographical “Time Means Tucker” was
published in The Bulletin in 1959,
and told of the adventures of two young
men making their way through the NSW
countryside, mainly Mudgee and the
Gulgong goldfields, in the early years
of the century.
PREJUDICE IN UNIVERSITY APPOINTMENTS
fcuLletCn
80 Years Ago: May 30, 1885
appointment of Mr Tucker, of
Auckland, to the post of Profes-
sor of Latin in the Melbourne Uni-
versity, is gratifying. He is not an
Anglican parson, and has not been
identified with Dr Moorhouse in the
work of Trinity College. For some
time back the Council have been filling
vacancies with such evident bias to-
wards a particular shade of thought
that the public is surprised not to find
a divine shoved into the chair. Giving
the Chancellorship to Bishop Moor-
house brought original sin into the
University world. For twenty years be-
fore that the institution had been the
high State School for Victorians of
every creed and none. It is an insult
to offer it to all classes now, with a
Protestant Bishop astride of it. But
other sins followed. The faction of the
Council impudent enough to scout the
protest of the Senate, and force the
Bishop on the country, did not rest
there. When the post of examiner in
Greek fell vacant, the Council filled it
with Canon Vance. An examiner in
Latin was wanted, and the Council
elected Canon Sargeant. A vacancy in
connection with English Literature
offered, and in went Canon Potter. It
is rumored that there will be other
vacancies soon, and that there will be
an Anglican canon ready for each of
them. The plea put in by the audacious
Anglicans, who have a majority in the
Council, is that in voting for these
men they do not regard them as
clerics but as scholars. Assume Dr
Moran chancellor of the Sydney Uni-
versity, a majority of Roman Catho-
lics in the Council, and vacancies, as
they arose, handed over to Fathers of
the Jesuit confraternity. Would the
plea avail? Would Parliament vote
another month’s subsidy? Why is it
that Victoria f.ghts so doggedly for
Secularism in its ordinary State
Schools while in its University, the
Premier State School of the colony, it
lets the Anglican Church rule the
roost?

PLAIN ENGLISH
Secret Tribunals
Tt was right and inevitable that Aus-
1 tralia would follow other advanced
industrial countries in legislating to
curb restrictive trade practices that
are against the public interest. But
the Bill which the Attorney-General,
Mr B. M. Snedden, introduced into
Parliament last week has many serious
defects. One of the gravest is that it
makes no provision whatever for the
public to be heard in its own case:
the proposed commissioner and his
tribunal are to be the sole custodian
of the public interest and the public
itself is locked out. The tribunal, it
is true, may choose to call for public
evidence, and a citizen may no doubt
use the Government post office to
wnte to the commissioner but these
are no subst,lutes tor statutory paths
° C. 'a ;tcccss ’ .. , , .
Instead of a formalised complaint
svstem with public access to public
system with pub ic access to public
tribunals, the Attorney-General pro-
poses a svstem combining the reeistra
poses a system combining the registra-
tion of certain practices and the
“examination” of others by a tribunal
sitting in camera. The Bulletin has
in the past argued against registra-
tion as an unnecessary and wasteful
nuisance; New Zealand tried it for
three years, then gave it up in favor
of a complaint svstem in which both
the Trade and Prices Commissioner
and the public could take the initia-
live. But Mr Snedden has clung to
registration for various classes of hori-
zontal trade agreements, apparently
feeling these are easier to define than
the multifarious bilateral and uni-
lateral practices which will not be
registrable under the Bill, only
examinable. The public will find it
hard to see any great difference in
anti-social practices which require to
be registered and, say, monopoly and
retail price maintenance practices
which are simply “examinable”. In-
deed, it is the latter practices which
will be the most readily investigated,
There seems no sense in singling out
some other practices for registration.
Why not drop registration altogether?
But the main criticism of the Bill,
as it now stands, remains that,
whether practices are registrable or
examinable, the public cannot com-
plain at all and has no access to the
commissioner. The only remedy is to
adopt the complaint system: a few
angry public callers a day would keep
a commissioner on his toes.
Equaliy important, the Government
sh J d intention t 0 hold al|
roceedings camera: the public
f nterest “ requires pub|ic h( £ ri
(which would in any case have "a
: « , . . J a „
marvellous deterrent effect). Finally,
there shou]d be an amendment to
„ u ■ , , . . ,
establish an independent appeals
soard _ instead of the proposed
, , , F

commercial world; they may not start
as bureaucrats but may end that way.
As it stands, the proposed Bill is a
sloppy compromise and certainly no
triumph yet for Sir Garfield Bar-
wick’s successor. It will satisfy no
one, least of all the public whose
interests are paramount. Even the
word “restrictive” has been dropped
from its title.
Passports for Hanoi
VText month an international Com-
1 munist conference, called by an
off-shoot of the World Federation of
Trade Unions, will be held in Hanoi
to discuss ways of helping North Viet-
nam conquer South Vietnam. An
Australian, Mr R. Rose, of Newcastle,
a member of the ALP, has announced
that he will attend the conference as
a representative of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation. The question
naturally has arisen whether the
immigration authorities should give
him a passport to help him go to
Hanoi.
It is clear that, in principle, the
Government should not give Mr Rose
a passport for this purpose. Mr
Rose’s integrity and good intentions
are undoubted and he is entitled to
hold whatever opinions he likes about
the war in Vietnam. But this is not
the issue involved. The Australian
Government has recognised that a
Communist victory in South Vietnam
would endanger Australia, and it has
backed this view by sending Aus-
tralian combat troops there to help
South Vietnam. They are going to a
dirty war and some casualties may be
inevitable. In these circumstances it
would be ridiculous, to use no
stronger a word, for the Australian
Government at one moment to send
a battalion of men to South Vietnam
to risk their lives and the next moment
to help another Australian go, even
as an observer, to a conference in
Hanoi called, among other things, to
help North Vietnam destroy that
battalion.
An Australian’s right to travel
freely is not to be interfered with
lightly, but—as the US Supreme Court
recognised early this month when it
upheld a Government refusal to grant
a passport to an American who wanted
to visit Cuba this right remains
subordinate to the requirements of
national security, including in this
case the security of Australian soldiers
abroad.
Ridicule
TTnfortunately some of those who
have welcomed the Customs
Department’s lifting of its ban on “The
Trial of Lady Chatterley”—an action
forced on it by the Sydney publishers
who had the enterprise to produce an
Australian edition—have gone on to
call once again for uniformity of
censorship laws in Australia. They
forget that it was the existing disunity
that enabled the Sydney publishers to
succeed in their plans; it was the fact
that most State authorities could find
nothing actionable in the book that
made the Customs Department look
ridiculous and shamed it into action.
If uniformity were introduced, it
would become so much the harder to
ridicule the censors. It is the censors,
not the reformers, who should be
advocating uniformity.
One obvious reform, however, is
indicated by this case. “The Trial”
was banned without reference to the
Literature Censorship Board because
it was a legal, not a literary work. In
future the Board’s advice should be
sought on all serious works, not simply
on novels and literary criticism.

TRADE PRACTICES—I
Putting the Consumers Offside
Second thoughts for the Federal Government
B. M. SNEDDEN
SIR GARFIELD BARWICK
MELBOURNE —Most of the changes
from Sir Garfield Barwick’s proposals
having been given open currency in the
last year or more, the big surprise in
Mr Billy Snedden’s Trade Practices Bill
is the new conception of the machinery
to determine whether agreements and
practices are offensive to the public in-
terest. When he spoke in Melbourne
last year the Attorney-General appeared
still to be envisaging a judicial tribunal,
and the main question worrying him was
By J. C. HORSFALL
who should be on it. Everything else
seemed to be pretty well cut and dried.
In the interim “wigs and gowns” have
been removed from the draft Bill and in
their place we have “machinery which
can proceed with the utmost informality
uninhibited by any particular rules of
evidence or procedure”. True, the presi-
dent of the tribunal will need legal
qualifications, Mr Snedden told Parlia-
ment when introducing the Bill last week,
but by his side will be two persons there
for their know-how. in business, industry
or public administration. How many
other members there would be, Mr Sned-
den did not say.
Some surprise has been expressed here
by the oblique way in which monopo-
listic practices figure in the Bill. It was
known, of course, that these were not to
be outlawed in the fashion of collusive
tendering and bidding, but now we find
they are not to be registrable practices
either, but simply examinable at the dis-
cretion of the commissioner, and him
alone. Being defined as any firm with
30 or more per cent of the local market,
monopoly is rather more embracing than
many expected.
There is no provision for the public
to lodge complaints against qionopoly,
or anything else for that matter. In the
event of the tribunal looking into any
practice or agreement the proceedings
will be in camera. All the public will
hear will, presumably, be the tribunal’s
findings. While business is delighted with
this secret procedure even the register
will not be open to public inspection in
any circumstances —the consuming pub-
lic, whose interests the Bill purports to
protect, are somewhat astounded that
no provision has been made for them
to lodge complaints or air their views
at all. At least, when registration of
practices was obligatory in New Zealand,
the public could look at the register on
payment of a small fee (though few ever
did so) and public complaints about
trade practices have been fairly frequent
there since registration was abolished in
1961 in favor of the complaint pro-
cedure.
Contrary to the general impression, it
is not correct to say the Bill by-passes
the subject of retail price maintenance
simply because it is not mentioned in
the document. There are several cate-
gories of agreements and practices where
it is cloaked in broader terminology,
registrable in some instances and
merely examinable in others. In the last
resort, however, it does not matter much
whether retail price maintenance comes
under the head of registrable or examin-
able, because both categories are ulti-
mately examinable at the discretion of
the commissioner.
Considering the opposition from some
sections of Cabinet, it comes as no sur-
prise that takeovers and mergers find no
place in the legislation. Here again the
business world has won a great victory
by its representations to the Govern-
ment that in practice control in these
fields would be a hindrance to develop-
ment. In his references to this contro-
versial area, one wondered whether a
frustrated Mr Snedden was not talking
rather with tongue-in-cheek in deference
to the opinion of his superiors. In an
obiter dicta he warned that the Labor
Government in Britain “is proceeding
with legislation under which certain
mergers and takeovers will be held up
pending an inquiry into their compati-
bility with the public interest”. Mr Sned-
den is young yet.
No doubt the new Bill’s more com-
promising approach owes quite a bit to
the views of the Premiers of some of the
States who will have to pass State legisla-
tion to make the Commonwealth Act
fully effective, but generally it looks very
much as though the Federal Government
itself has had many second thoughts
since Sir Garfield Barwick sold it on the
stiff proposals he first put up in Decem-
ber, 1962. Having committed itself to
the legislation, it has bent back-
wards to take the pass from its business
friends and in the process probably put
quite a few consumers offside.
TRADE PRACTICES—II
...and the reply
Preserving competition
CANBERRA Attorney-General B.
M. Snedden anticipated critics waiting to
condemn his Bill as a watered-down ver-
sion of Sir Garfield Barwick’s original
proposals when he declared in his second
reading speech that his changes were
designed “so as not to permit any dilution
of the legislation such as would prevent
it from achieving the purpose the Gov-
ernment has at all times intended to
achieve”. The purpose the Government
intended to achieve was simply stated:
To preserve competition in Australian
trade and commerce to the extent re-
quired by the public interest.
Mr Snedden’s reaction to the critics’
reaction is briefly given in his replies to
the following questions:
Question: Does the legislation cover


a substantially smaller field than the
original proposals?
Mr Snedden’s answer: It covers a
smaller field, but I don’t agree that it
is substantially smaller. Although the
vertical practices included in the original
proposals are now omitted, they will
really be covered by the action on multi-
lateral agreements. I have come to the
conclusion that almost all vertical prac-
tices are manifestations only of a multi-
lateral agreement which stands behind.
If you break down that agreement the
vertical practice will crumble.
Question: Why have you removed
from the list of inexcusably unlawful
practices (a) monopolisation and (b)
“persistent price-cutting at a loss to drive
a competitor out of business”?
Answer: These have been removed be-
cause the only practices that should be
absolutely prohibited are those which
can in no circumstances be compatible
with the public interest. Monopolisation
engaged in the course of carrying on a
business will be an examinable practice.
On persistent price-cutting I received
strong representations that it could not
By JOHN WEBB
be said there should never be circum-
stances in which this could be compatible
with the public interest. The Govern-
ment thought both of these should be
examinable so that it could be deter-
mined whether they were in the public
interest.
The original provision of “persistent
price-cutting at a loss to drive a com-
petitor out of business” now appears as
one aspect of monopolisation, i.e., a
person in a dominant position “price-
cutting with the object of substantially
damaging a customer”. In practice, the
problems of proof will be lessened and
the new provisions should be more
effective.
Question: Consumers are reportedly
disappointed that no direct restrictions
are placed on resale price maintenance.
How will your Bill deal with this
practice?
Answer: There were strong arguments
in completely opposite directions on this.
One side said we should include resale
price maintenance agreements in the
Bill in order to authorise them and give
groups the right to collectively enforce
their agreements. The other side
demanded outright prohibition. The
Government decided to leave resale
price maintenance uncovered so that
such agreements cannot be enforced, yet
the individual trader will be free to
refuse supplies to anybody who refuses
to observe the price structure he has
himself decided to set. Of course, if
that trader makes an agreement with
another trader as to price, then it will
become a multi-lateral agreement subject
to the ‘provisions of the Bill. This means,
in effect, multi-lateral resale price main-
tenance is covered.
Question: How can you deal with
mergers and takeovers?
Answer: If the result of a merger or
takeover is such that the merger group
is in a dominant position (having more
than one-third of the market), then the
monopolisation section will operate. If
they do anything that falls within the
three stipulated classes of conduct, the
practice will become examinable on a
monopolisation basis.
Question: What part do you expect the
Commissioner of Trade Practices to play
in reducing the number of restrictive
practices without resort to the Tribunal?
Answer: A very important one. Our
intention is that the Tribunal will con-
duct no more hearings than necessary.
This is why the Commissioner is re-
quired to consult with the parties before
referring a matter to the Tribunal for
decision as to public interest. Together,
the Commissioner and the parties can
thrash out the issues and determine the
exact reasons for an agreement or
practice. The result might be that the
parties will agree to make changes or
the Commissioner might decide that
although there is some detriment there
is greater benefit, say, through the pro-
tection of smaller businesses. The Bill,
of course, provides for any agreement
that is reached to be recorded in the
Tribunal.
Question: What is your comment on
statements that the new public interest
criterion is too vague?
Answer: I don't think it is too vague.
I think it is very precise. What has been
said to be vague is the range of items
which a party before the Tribunal is
able to put forward as benefits flowing
from the agreement or practice. You
can hardly be more precise than to say
to the Tribunal that it is to proceed on
the principle that the encouragement and
preservation of competition is in the
public interest. You can never define
public interest because that is the very
thing which you set up the Tribunal to
determine. The Tribunal has to weigh
the detriment constituted by the restric-
tion of competition against any benefits
which the parties can show.

ALP
Once More the Breach
Victorian Labor’s Controllers
MELBOURNE Their heavy defeat
at last year's Victorian ALP conference
taught Mick Jordan and his supporters
that there was no immediate hope of
wresting power away from the fellow-
travellers and neutralists who run the
Victorian Party. Jordan has sent his run-
ners out with the message that he will
neither contest nor attend this year's con-
ference. In return the Victorian Party
controllers have let it be known that if
Jordan sticks to his decision, they will
put a few moderates on their executive
ticket. Those most likely to be chosen
for this concession are solicitor John
Button, and Richard McGarvie and
Xavier Connor, both Queen’s Counsels.
The absence of the Jordan Group will
leave the way almost completely open for
the extreme Leftists to realise their long-
cherished dream, the legalising of unity
tickets. Their attempts to avoid Federal
rulings on unity tickets have already
alienated the sympathies of the Victorian
president, Bob Holt, but working
through the Trade Union Defence Com-
mittee, the unity-ticket promoters seem
sure to win their motions at the confer-
ence. Holt made his views clear when
he walked out of an executive meeting
which he was chairing last year, after a

EVERYWHERE
For your nearest write:
125 Flinders Lane, Melbourne
A Keith Courtenay keeps its crisp new look longer than any other suit
unity ticket allegation in the Waterside
Workers’ Elections received cursory treat-
ment.
The chief proponents of unity tickets
now view them as of political as well
as industrial significance. Men like Don
McSween of the Clothing Trades Union,
Bill O'Brien of the ARU, Wally Butler
of the Amalgamated Engineers’ and Bert
Nolan of the Seamen’s Union, leaders of
the Trade Union Defence Committee
and directors of Victorian ALP policy,
would seem to want political as well as
industrial unity with Communists.
This conclusion is not gathered only
from Trades Hall whispers and gossip
in the Lygon Hotel. It is available in
the pages of “Scope”, the magazine of
the Trade Union Defence Committee,
which is written almost wholly by Mc-
Sween and his allies. The world as pic-
tured in “Scope” apparently consists
largely of the following features:
• American warmongers attempting
desperately to conquer the world for a
dollar.
• Capitalist bosses who get richer
and richer, whilst the poor become more
numerous and downtrodden.
• A peace-loving Soviet Union re-
buffed at every charitable turn by envi-
ous Western leaders.
• An angry Western proletariat,
moving closer and closer to unity, which
will shortly rise and, marching under
one banner, come forward to seize its
rightful inheritance. ‘
The last part of the above mythology
is receiving a lot more attention these
days in both the Communist and Left-
Labor Press. The plan for the Labor
Party is to purge it of its social-demo-
cratic, civic-reformist elements and make
it the chief vehicle of a resurrected
united front. Such a party may not
be an immediate success at the hustings
of Australian bourgeois democracy, but
it will provide a good training (and
reasonable security) for the kind of men
who will be needed to gain our admis-
sion to the glorious Federation of
Workers’ States of Asia. So far as your
correspondent can predict the most not-
able delegate likely to actively oppose
the proposals made by the united front
group at the conference will be Senator
Pat Kennelly, who has been bold enough
to decide that the Communists are a
bigger threat to mankind than the DLP.
Now that its chiefs hold undisputed
sway over the Victorian ALP, the Trade
Union Defence Committee is becoming
a more informal and casual body. Last
year it did not bother to meet officially
to work out its completely successful
ticket for the Victorian executive, but
left the running of the ticket to 13 trust-
ed officials from the extreme Leftist
trade unions. A similar thing happen-
ed this year, except that veteran Labor
leader, Mr Albert McNolty, was left out


of the consultations. McNolty lost favor
with the ruling junta in March when he
tried independently to organise a deal
with Mick Jordan in the Trades Hall
Council elections.
McSween and his comrades were in-
censed at the idea of doing a deal with
Jordan. So far as they are concerned
anyone who does not support their
united front with the Communists is a
“Grouper” and an agent of Santamaria,
Menzies and Senator Goldwater. Mc-
Sween’c attitudes are not simply based
on ideology. His hatred of the Groupers
stems principally from 1954 when he
was the ALP candidate for the city
electorate of Isaacs. —He lost the seat
narrowly but would almost certainly
have won if the Groupers had not re-
fused to work for him in the campaign.
Since that time he has led the anti-
Grouper fight in Victoria from behind
the scenes, but with driving bitterness
and much intelligence.
The ALP Federal Secretary, Mr Cyril
Wyndham, and his parliamentary associ-
ates who still believe that political parties
should offer representative and vote-
winning policies will gather no com-
fort from next month’s Victorian con-
ference. The only real solution to their
problems is for Federal leaders to take
the kind of strong action in Victoria,
Queensland and Western Australia which
could lead to another split. The Vic-
torian ALP is prepared for this and the
machinery for the establishment of an
industrial Labor Party has already been
set up. But so long as Mr Arthur
Calwell remains Parliamentary Leader
this machinery will remain hidden and
unused in the back room of the Trades
Hall. And the betting is now on much
the wrong side of even money that
Mr Calwell will be around to lead the
Party to another heavy electoral defeat
in 1966.

Whispers for Drongos
“Beats” and “Off-beats ”
SYDNEY Not since the bankruptcy
of the sensational “Beckett’s Budget” in
1929 has NSW been subjected to such
second-hand sex and schoolboy humor
as is being dished out by the Sydney
tabloid-publications the “Kings Cross
Whisper” and its sister fortnightly the
“Drongo”. Already the “Whisper” has
been banned in Queensland under the
Objectionable Literature Act of 1954
which provides a penalty of up to £lOO,
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
with £5OO for a second offence, while the
fourth issue attracted the ever-beady eyes
of the Melbourne Vice Squad and two
“Whisper” salesmen were convicted and
fined £2O in the City Court for selling
an obscene publication. Even the all-
powerful Barrier Industrial Council has
banned the “Whisper” from Broken Hill.
In early April seven “Whisper” sellers
lobbed into this so-called city of sin.
The BIC stepped in, labelled the paper
“utter filth”, and placed a black ban on
it. The Council invoked its unique boy-
cott measures to halt immediately the
“Whisper’s” distribution. Unionists were
not permitted to buy the paper nor give
any service of any kind to the pedlars.
Hotel proprietors were warned that if
they allowed the paper to be sold on their
premises they would be black-listed.
Retaliating, the publishers issued a writ
taken out in the Supreme Court of NSW
by Mr Clive Evatt, QC, against the Bar-
rier Industrial Council and affiliated
groups for £250,000. There is also an
appeal pending over the conviction of
“Whisper” sellers in Melbourne.
Curiously, it was Mr Clive Evatt’s
brother, Dr H. V. Evatt, who appeared
for “Beckett’s Budget” in 1928 when the
Commonwealth Postmaster - General,
acting under Section 29 of the Post and
A "DRONGO" SELLER
Telegraph Act, had the “Budget” remov-
ed from the list of registered newspapers
on the grounds of obscenity. Dr Evatt
represented the publishers when they
appealed for restoration to the list but
the appeal was dismissed. Several months
after, however, the “Budget” was restored
to the list, and then went bankrupt a year
later.
Behind the bawdy “Whisper” and per-
haps the less bawdy “Drongo” are two
former newspaper journalists, Terry
Blake and Jim Ramsay. Blake, who is
the chief of the South Pacific
Feature Service Prop., Ltd, told The
Bulletin that the “Whisper” began as
a gimmick on New Year’s Eve last year.
“It was Ramsay’s idea he had pro-
duced the “Waratah Whisper” in Darwin
1 — and I had the Feature Service. We
printed 25,000 at two shillings a copy
and it sold well enough to convince us it
was worth printing another,” Blake said.
Three companies have been involved
in the production of both papers the
Kings Cross Whisper Prop., Ltd, the
South Pacific Feature Service Prop., Ltd,
and the Kings Cross Publishing Company
(in which Blake’s brother has a share)
to handle distribution.
Blake, who would not reveal the pre-
sent circulation of the “Whisper”, did
claim that it outsold every publication in
NSW except for women’s magazines.
“Drongo”, he said, had an initial circula-
tion of 100,000 and had sold out within
two weeks. “Drongo” is a form of op-
position to the “Whisper” and the pre-
sent trends are that it will capture much
of this market. “ ‘Drongo’ expresses my
outlook and personality while Ramsay
handles ‘Whisper’,” said Blake.
Distribution has been a great problem
but now there are distribution points
throughout the NSW country districts,
Adelaide and Melbourne. And of the
beatnik-looking sellers? “Anybody can
sell ‘Whisper’ and ‘Drongo’. Perhaps the
reason for the greater percentage of
‘off-beats’ selling is because it takes an
‘off-beat’ to sell an ‘off-beat’ publica-
tion.” Blake said there were 250 sellers
on the books and a good seller could earn
from £3O to £4O a week at 9d a copy.

State aid on the political board
CANBERRA —There was a crucial
twist to last week’s wrangle in the
Federal Parliamentary Labor Caucus
over State Aid it was the Deputy
Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough

Leader, Mr Arthur Calwell, in the Party

whether Labor, as Mr Calwell wished,
should oppose outright the Government’s
legislation on State Aid.
Mr Whitlam has been making his views
known on the inevitability of Labor’s
endorsement of the principle of direct
Aid for months within the councils of the
Labor Party. But one of the obstacles
in the way of Mr Whitlam’s progress to
leadership of his Party has been the
ability of his opponents, and even his
friends, to point out that his ideas con-
tinually fall short of realisation in Caucus
itself; more damagingly, that he is un-
willing to stand and fight in the place
that finally matters the Party room.
He did this last Wednesday and won.
His victory is no less because Mr Calwell
made it surprisingly easy for Mr Whit-
lam. It is a measure of the confusion
within the ranks of the Parliamentary
Party that its Leader, having 12 months
earlier successfully advocated to the
Opposition that they should not oppose
a similar Government Bill, was able to
rally 32 votes in favor of a complete
reversal last week. But Mr Calwell him-
self was by no means confused. He had
in mind this week’s meeting of the Fed-
eral Executive and the necessity, for his
own survival, of the support of the im-
placable opponents of State Aid led by
Mr F. E. Chamberlain of Western Aus-
tralia. An added surety —even necessary
condition?—of this support was Mi
Calwell’s turnabout last week.
In search of face-saving reasons foi
Caucus, Mr Calwell invoked the usual
shibboleths of Party policy. But as Mr
F. Daly blandly pointed out, the policy-
liners, who included Dr J. F. Cairns, Mi
Martin Nicholls, and Senator Cavanagh,
were conveniently ignoring the Party’s
policy on nationalisation of TV stations,
This could well have been brought to
bear on a Bill affecting the Broadcasting
and Television Act, also before Parlia-
ment last week.
As a domino on the table of politics
State Aid has a role in the Labor Part)
that has largely been ignored. Mr Whit-
lam pointed it out some time ago. State
Aid has involved the Labor Party in a
series of false moves because the so-
called Left views socialism in the context
of the last century anything that helps
the Church must harm the radical cause.
If the Left comes out of its hangover it
might recognise that there is now a
pluralist society. It might even find that,
having moved itself into the 20th century,
there are powerful arguments against
State Aid arguments which the Left
could at least approach, whether they are
conclusive or not, and show that the
Labor Party is at least with it.

“An open town ”
ADELAIDE The South Australian
Government is preparing legislation for
an Aborigines’ Lands Trust to give the
State’s 7,000 Aborigines control of thous-
ands of acres of reserves and Crown
lands. The trust will consist entirely of
Aborigines and provision will be made
for the progressive transfer of lands to
the trust.
At the start, certain southern reserves,
unoccupied reserved lands and some oc
cupied but unsupervised reserves will be
involved. Later, says the Aboriginal
Affairs Minister, Mr Don Dunstan, largei
supervised reserves will be transferred tc
the trust if the Aborigines’ councils 01
the reserves approve.
The prospect of Aborigines runninj
their own stations and farms on forme
reserves has received a mixed welcome

doubt if Aborigines would be able to
manage their own affairs with half as
much benefit to themselves as they now
enjoy.”
The trust proposal follows a move by
the Government to make the Point
Pearce Aborigine reserve on Yorke
Peninsula an open town, and is part of
the Government’s policy to “assist the
Aborigine to gain the development he
wants”. Last month the Government
lifted the last restrictions on Aborigines
by giving them full drinking rights. This
action was followed by a pledge of the
“very swiftest action” if there was any
discrimination against Aboriginal
drinkers, but apart from a claim by the
manager of Port Augusta’s Western Hotel
that “two-thirds of the population is up
in arms and dead set against the lifting
of restrictions”, there has been no report
of opposition or incidents. And recently
the SA Housing Trust reported that Abo-
rigine families were among its best ten-
ants.
These are the bright spots. In the Port
Augusta court recently, Mr Grubb, SM,
criticised some officials of the Davenport
native reserve for their dictatorial atti-
tude in “arresting” natives and he sug-
gested that the officials check their
authority or they might find themselves
charged with unlawful arrest. He was
hearing a case in which a native woman
had been “arrested” by officials and taken
into Port Augusta to be charged by police
after she had appeared naked during a
drinking bout. And Mr McKee, MP,
revealed that some Aborigines were living
in appalling conditions in wurlies on the
outskirts of Port Augusta.

Barney to administer the branch until
the Federal Executive next meets.
Living up to the tempestuous reputa-
tion of themselves and their union, two
of those dismissed, McGrane and Roch-
fort, have refused to vacate office.
Lawyers are preparing for lengthy litiga-
tion and police stand guard when the
union meets. The one certain aspect
appearing is that the only force prevent-
ing a take-over of the NSW Branch by
the Communists and their allies has
been the surprising emergence of the
Korea veteran, the tough, young, acting
secretary Ron Dowdell. The wrangles
began in the ’sos as a personality clash
in the Industrial group when NSW
Branch was a Communist stronghold.
The young Mr J. N. Lynch and the late
Mr J. Gill fought this phase out with
Lynch—the victor—becoming the very
capable administrator and NSW sec-
retary. Mr C. J. McGrane forced his
way forward then as the successful
Group candidate for Federal secretary.
A feud, based on either ambition or
personality, sprang up between Lynch
and McGrane, but this was kept bottled
up by the Industrial groups and what
remained of them after the split. In
the 1961 elections Lynch defeated
McGrane supporters on the Federal
Executive by producing three separate
tickets only one of which supported all
Right-wing candidates. The ensuing
struggle saw three groups battling for
power—the Left-wing Communists, the
Lynch group and the McGrane forces,
the last now including Lynch’s assistant
secretary Mr M. R. Mayell. Thinly-
veiled accusations of corruption were
tossed about, court cases followed, Lynch
was forcibly removed from office and
suspended by the ALP. Mayell came to
power.
He received ALP backing and that
party claimed the credit for his victory
—quite wrongly. Anti-Communist forces
were the decisive element but in the
process this group fell to quarrelling
and have not yet healed the breach.
One important lesson was learned—but
not heeded—from this ballot. The ALP
Right-wing establishment, unless it is
organised and goes in as a fighting
unified force, is useless —platitudes from
party officers, politicians and Labor
Council officials win no votes in union
elections. As we go to press Slater,
Dowdell, Barney and Ryan were moving
fast and firmly to consolidate, and other
groupings were pitching for either CP
or DLP support. To the members, at
least, the lessons of a decade are clear.
The future of their union as a cohesive
benefit-gaining anti-Communist force in
NSW is bound up in a victory for the
Dowdell, Barney, Ryan group.
LAW
Beint Sensible
Paying the legal costs
SYDNEY The State Attorney-
General, Mr K. M. McCaw’s announce-
ment last week that he intended intro-
ducing legislation to establish a fund to
pay legal costs of people acquitted of
criminal charges was greeted by legal
circles as being a move toward sensible
legal aid in the State. This fund, said
Mr McCaw, would be an extension of
the principle under which the Suitor’s
Fund (costs for certain appeals are met
from this fund) now operated and would
allow magistrates and judges to award
full costs or part of costs in the acquit-
ted person’s favor.
Following close on Mr McCaw’s an-
nouncement the president of the NSW
Bar Association, Mr J. D. Holmes, QC,
assured him of the Association’s support.
Mr Holmes said the Bar Association had
made recommendations for legal aid in
a more general form than those proposed
by the Attorney-General. “We want to
support some scheme of legal aid which
would cover the Attorney-General’s pro-
posals, but which would go beyond this
include civil matters.” Mr Holmes
said it was only hoped that a new system
of legal aid would be high on the list of
priorities for legislation that was at pre-
sent being drawn up by Mr McCaw.
Although NSW has had a system of
State legal aid assistance in civil cases
dating since 1908, and of legal aid for
criminal matters since 1907, the opera-
tion of these two systems has, until re-
cently, been hampered by a harsh means
test. The Public Solicitor can grant legal
assistance for actions and proceedings in
the Supreme and District Courts. In the
Petty Sessions Court assistance can be
granted for hire-purchase matters, lay-
by, or certain kinds of loans and mort-
gages,
On the criminal side the Public De-
fender will act for accused persons in
Quarter Sessions and the Central
Criminal Court, but not in Petty Ses-
sions (as a general rule). At present the

Meanwhile, the Victorian Attorney-
General, Mr Rylah, has said he would
ask the Commonwealth to start a Federal
legal aid system as soon as possible. This
follows a recommendation from Vic-
toria's legal aid committee. Mr Rylah
said the committee had informed him
that a Federal scheme was urgently
needed to allow adequate assistance in
maintenance and divorce cases. The
committee had also suggested that the
Federal Government be asked to share
in the administrative costs of the scheme
and possibly to assist in the expense
involved in some complicated proceed-
ings before the High Court.
DEVELOPMENT
The Marriage
Becoming productive
PERTH A strange marriage be-
tween pure research and world com-
merce is to be consummated in July
in the far south of Western Australia.
In a new concept of American participa-
tion in Australian development, a study
group has been given access to 4,400,000
acres of hitherto unproductive land to
see if it can be made productive.
The study group has called itself
Western Australian Corporation. Among
the big development, research and
finance companies associated with it are
those which proved to the British and ;
French Governments the feasibility of
the English Channel tunnel idea. One
of the partners is Battelle Development
Corporation, owned by the Battelle
Memorial Institute, one of the world’s
great research organisations. Another is
the De Leuw Cather group, consultant
engineers, already deeply involved in
the planning of Perth’s traffic design,
and another again is Planners Collabora-
tive, a consultant to the Brazilian Gov-
ernment on the establishment of Brazilia.
The areas to be studied stretch 300
miles in three huge chunks along the
bottom of the State between the Bight'
and the trans-continental railway—from
north of Esperance to within 50 miles
of the South Australian border. Despite
the poor quality of the land, inspiration
is certainly evident at the Esperance end
where trace elements have transformed
millions of acres of barren bush into
productive farmland.
If the group can prove that agri-
cultural potential, minerals, or pastoral
potential is in the area, they will submit
their ideas to the State Government
which can then say whether or not the
schemes are to go ahead. For their
trouble, the group could be in on the
ground floor of a mining, agricultural,
or pastoral breakthrough.


AROUND MELBOURNE
A Mural for 1000 Years
Art with a laser ray
Otan Ostoja-Kotkowski, the artist,
wears a great jazzy ski jumper,
his hair is long and an Abraham
Lincoln beard circumnavigates the
perimeter of his jaw. He is long and
lean, and actually he has an astonish-
ing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln.
He has that sort of perspiring
energy which is almost too much on
a quiet Tuesday morning. He has a
show in oil opening within a fort-
night in Krakow, Poland, another
opening soon at the South Yarra
Gallery. He recently completed great
mural sculptures in the BP buildings
in Melbourne and Adelaide. He has
been working on stage sets in both
cities for Wal Cherry, and as for his
electronic art he has been purveying
that all over the place.
He has been around for some time,
but he first really startled me last
year with his show of electronic art
at the Argus Gallery. Among the
critics, only Alan Warrea of “The
Sun” really gave it a pass. He even
got the label “Wurlitzer Art”. This
made Stan erupt slightly: “Everything
with them has to be traditional. Un-
less you sit down with an easel, a
paint brush and oils, to them it is
not art. They cannot understand that
in this age we have to branch out
into new methods. To paint this
world of space, surely we have to
use electronics.”
As we talked Stan was now im-
mensely happy because we had just
received the news that a GTV-9 film
using his electronic painting had won
an Australian Film Institute award.
It is not easy for a man who uses
a TV set for strictly normal purposes
to explain how he does this electronic
painting. However, a TV set pro-
duces a picture by drawing a series
of horizontal lines. But by the use of
electronics, magnetic fields and such,
it is possible to trace all sorts of
fantastic patterns, delicious, delicate
electrical networks. Stan takes photo-
graphs of these, or films them, and
sets them to electronic music. While
this produces an art form of a very
interesting kind, one gets the im-
pression that if you want to remain
a TV fan it would be inadvisable to
lend him your TV set.
Obviously he wants to do a great
deal more with electronic art, and
once his ideas start to flow it is hard
to stop the man. He has done a
12ft by 6ft mural for the Dollar Club
in Adelaide, which is turned on for
two hours daily lights and colors
constantly changing.
“But you know what I’d like to
do. A mural for the terminal at
Tullamarine. All the lights could be
activated by sound, the conversation
levels, the scrape of feet, car horns,
and the shriek of jet engines ... all
different colors and shapes.”
He continued and as he spoke one
had visions of James Bond: “Elec-
tronic sculpture could be next. I
have a scientist friend at Salisbury.
He can’t give me the details yet. But
soon I think we will be able to
sculpture electronically with the
laser ray.”
Stan was born at Przasnysz, Poland,
and during the Second World War
he was a member of the Polish under-
ground. After migrating to Australia
he studied at Melbourne’s National
Gallery under Alan Sumner and
William Dargie. “I studied at the
gallery,” he said, “from 2 p.m. until
9 p.m. Then to make my living, I cut
sandwiches between 2 a.m. and 12
noon I cut 600. Sick of cutting bread?
Yes, very sick of cutting bread. But
we ate. We all ate. I don’t think
there’s ever been such a well-fed
group of students at the gallery.”
He tried commercial art, fabric
design, became fed up and went off
to work as a laborer out in the
Centre at Leigh Creek, near Maree.
He learnt about metals, about mining
and this is what gave him a fascina-
tion for different materials.
Now he has to be different. For his
show at the South Yarra he is using
a startling pigment imported from the
US, the same sort of iridescent paint
that TAA and Ansett-ANA use to
frighten off other aeroplanes.
For his BP buildings, he used
copper plating over fibre glass
toughened with resin. The Melbourne
sculpture mural is 50 feet long. “The
site just asked for copper,” he said.
“BP have been kind but even the
builders of the pyramids would have
complained about the cost of all that
copper. So I had to think of some-
thing different, to get the effects I
wanted, glints and reflections of red.
I wanted it to look as if it were carved
out of solid grease.”
Stan was lucky. One of the direc-
tors of BP is very much an art en-
thusiast. Melbourne is a town in
which the public companies should
be ashamed over how little they have
spent in art. And Stan can be very
voluble on this one. “In places like
Vienna it is the law to spend a per-
centage of the cost of any building on
works of art. In Australia it’s the
other way round. Usually they would
much rather spend their money on
air-conditioning or wall-to-wall car-
pets. Sometimes, true, they find they
have a little bit of money left over
afterwards. But then it’s too late
no proper space is provided.”
His mural is not completely under-
standable to everyone in the BP
building. Some of the old hands tend
to raise an eyebrow. Nevertheless it
is something to see, particularly at
night when going up the steps from
St Kilda Road.
Stan has no doubts about the
validity of the materials he has used.
He says it will still be there in 500
or 1000 years. And that’s an admir-
able thing about Stanislaus Ostoja-
Kotkowski. He doesn’t lack at all in
confidence.

Who Runs The Vietcong?
“Sabotage the Geneva agreements... invade the South”...
MOTHER AND SON - VIETCONG VICTIMS
VIETCONG PRISONER - "IRRESPECTIVE OF SEX"
NATIONALIST OR FRONT MAN?
Though only casually noticed in the
world Press,- a development on
December 8, 1964, indicated that,
even if through some miracle peace could
be brought to the tragic people in Viet-
nam, there would be little hope for peace
in South-East Asia. On that day the
clandestine radio “Voice of the People of
Thailand” issued a lengthy Manifesto of
the Thailand Independence Movement.
The manifesto was quickly taken up and
given full play by Peking, Hanoi, and
the Pathet Lao. Those who have been
watching developments in East and
South-East Asia since World War II
recognised immediately the technique
and the pattern. The manifesto called
for a broad united front of “all patriots
and democrats, irrespective of their
class and stratum, their sex, age, history,
profession, past record”.
The programme and policies of the
movement were listed as the following:
1. Drive the US imperialist aggressors
out of Thailand.
2. Overthrow the traitorous and
despotic Thanom Government and set up
another to be composed of patriotic and
democratic political parties and indivi-
duals committed to a policy of neutrality
and peace.
3. Fight for the salvation and preser-
vation of the genuine democratic rights
of the people.
4. Fight for a policy of neutrality,
peace, and democracy, and prosperity,
and for the people’s well-being.
The language and the approach are
all too familiar. It was just such a
call by Mao Tse-tung during the war
against Japan which helped to bring
many of the smaller parties favoring
internal peace between the Communists
and the Kuomintang into his united front
of the New Democracy. Mao played
down such items as forceful agrarian
policies and appealed for a broad front
of “the people” who opposed outside
interference in China. Immediately after
World War II the more strident demand
was for the overthrow of the “traitorous
and despotic Chiang clique”, for the
ouster of the US imperialists, and for
full independence and democracy for
China. During the revelations of the
“Hundred Flowers” period a decade later
the leaders of the minor parties in
Peking's United Front revealed the ex-
tent of their disillusionment and how
masterfully the Chinese Communist
Party had deceived them. Yet the Mao
strategy had proved successful in bring-
ing many of the intellectuals, bureau-
crats, students, and natural leaders to
support his guerrilla warfare and his
final military drive against the Kuomin-
tang in China.
The same pattern was repeated with
equal success by Ho Chi-minh in Viet-
nam during the struggle against the
French. The Vietnamese Communists had
created a League for the Independence of
Vietnam (known as the Vietminh) in
South China in May, 1941. Because of
the heavy-handed manner of control by
the Communists, it did not attract wide
support. Ho subsequently changed tac-
tics and on November 11, 1945, dis-
solved in name, at least, the Indo-Chinese
Communist Party, on the same day an-
nouncing the formation of the Associa-
tion for Marxist Studies. This in turn
became part of the Vietnamese Popular
National Front (the Lien Viet) established
in May, 1946. The new Front was the
chief political organisation behind the
anti-colonialist war of the Vietnam
People's Army against the French. With
the victory of the Chinese Communists
in 1949 and the outbreak of the war in
BY RICHARD L. WALKER
(Professor Walker is a leading American authority
on International Relations and the author of “China
Under Communism’’ and “The Continuing Struggle’’.)
Korea, the Communists in Vietnam were
able to establish firm control over the
amorphous group of patriots who ral-
lied around the policies they proclaimed.
The policies included, not surprisingly,
the driving out of the French imperialists
(and, after 1950, their American allies),
the establishment of “independence and
democracy” and struggle for the well-
being of the people.
By 1951 the Vietnamese Communists
were sufficiently self-confident of their
control to re-establish their party openly,
this time called the Workers’ Party or
Lao Dong Party. This party, bearing a
close relationship in its organisational
form to the Chinese Communist Party,
consolidated control over the Democra-
tic Republic of Vietnam, and eventually
negotiated the Geneva Agreements which
gained independence from the French
in 1954. Meanwhile, the Vietnam's
People’s Army, operating in the name of
the Front, had been built into a formid-
able force and its cadres had carried out
a campaign of terror in the countryside
in the name of “agrarian reform”. The
Front operation, as in China, proved its
efficiency in helping to establish the dic-
tatorship of the Communist Party.
The success of revolutionary warfare,
linked with political organisation under
the cloak of a united front of “the
people” in both China and Vietnam, was
bound to encourage Communist leaders
to adopt the same strategy for other
areas into which they planned to move.
While this Front strategy is only in its
beginning stages for Thailand, its appli-
cation in South Vietnam has had far too
little attention. The problems of pro-
viding security against guerrilla attack
and of maintaining military control and
administrative integrity naturally corn-
mand and deserve major attention. But
the opponents of the Communist forces
have all too frequently underestimated
Communist ability at political and pro-
paganda organisation which have pro-
vided back-stopping for the guerrilla
warfare. Chiang Kai-shek underestima-
ted the political aspects of his struggle
with the Communists in mainland China
and, as Bernard Fall has ably pointed out
in his book, “The Two Vietnams”, the
United States has also permitted military
exigencies to overshadow the need for
political organisation. In short, the
Communists have worked with a long-
range strategic perspective, and their
opponents have dealt with day-to-day
problems of military security. The
February 27, 1965, Department of State
“White Paper” on Vietnam reflects the
inadequate attention given to the politi-
cal aspects of the struggle in South
Vietnam. There are only three short
paragraphs devoted to the National Front
for the Liberation of South Vietnam
(NFLSV), which through organisation,
direction, and control by Ho Chi-minh’s
Lao Dong Party is being groomed to re-
present the “people of South Vietnam” as
their legitimate broadly-based united
front government.
The politico-military strategy behind
the NFLSV deserves close attention.
After the Geneva Agreements of 1954
and the confirmation of Communist con-
trol in North Vietnam, Hanoi created a
new Fatherland Front of Vietnam, which
was to pull together nationwide support
for the re-unification of the whole coun-
try. Given the migration to the South
of hundreds of thousands of refugees
from the Communist terror, this larger
Fatherland Front had little success and
has held only infrequent meetings. Hanoi
therefore set up yet another Front, whose
activities were to be focused exclusively
on the southern part of the country: the
NFLSV. Its formation was announced
publicly by Vietnamese guerrilla leaders
in the South on December 20, 1960. The
manifesto of that date, not surprisingly,
called, among other items, for the “over-
throw of the camouflaged regime of the
American imperialists and the dictatorial
power of Ngo Dinh Diem”, for the insti-
tution of a “liberal and democratic
regime”, and for a “foreign policy of
peace and neutrality”.
To maintain the fiction that the
NFLSV was a truly indigenous move-
ment in the South (although the wording
of the manifesto clearly indicated other-
wise), Ho Chi-minh’s regime did not give
full publicity to the new Front until
February, 1961. When Hanoi released
the text of the manifesto on February 11,
several significant changes had been
made. Items which tended to indicate
the Lao Dong origin or ambitions for
the Front where altered or deleted. Like
the manifesto of the Thailand Independ-
ence Movement issued almost exactly
four years later, that of the NFLSV advo-
cated social and economic reforms de-
signed to appeal to every segment of the
population and to encourage the fullest
expression of national feeling. Statements
of the Front have also tended to play
down the issue of immediate unification
for Vietnam, another indication of the
attempt to present it as a movement ori-
ginating in the South.
Almost immediately the Front set up
a “provisional central committee” which
served until the meeting of the First
Congress of the NFLSV, held from
February 16 until March 3, 1962.
Meanwhile, Hanoi adopted the ruse that
had worked so well in November, 1945,
to conceal the extent of Communist
domination of the Front. In December,
1961, the Communist Party in the South
disappeared and a new People’s Revolu-
tionary Party (PRP) was formed. How-
ever, it openly proclaimed its adherence
to . Marxism and Leninism and acknow-
ledged its direct descent from the origi-
nal Indo-Chinese Communist Party. As
was pointed out by the British Scholar
P. J. Honey, captured “Top Secret”
documents submitted to the Interna-
tional Control Commission revealed the
tactical nature of this move. One of
these documents, intended for senior
Communists in the South, stated bluntly:
It should be explained inside the
Party that the object of forming the
People’s Revolutionary Party is to
isolate the Americans and the Ngo
Dinh Diem regime and to rebut their
accusations about the invasion of the
South by the North. It is a move
which will permit us to sabotage the
Geneva agreements, to advance the
plan for invading the South, and will,
at the same time, permit the Front for
the Liberation of South Vietnam to
recruit new members and to win the
sympathy of the non-aligned States of
South-East Asia.
At the time the ostensibly new Com-
munist Party for the South was an-
nounced in January, 1962, the NFLSV
took great pains to stress that the PRP
was merely the equal of, and not
superior to, the other constituent ele-
ments in the Front organisation. I his
was probably not very convincing to
leaders among the refugees who came
South and who had experienced the Lao
Dong operations within the Lien Viet.
It has been clear from the outset, both
in terms of personnel and in terms of

the jargon of the statements issued, that
the PRP is in effective control of the
activities of the Front. Members of the
PRP are those who directed earlier
operations of the Lao Dong Party in
South Vietnam, and this is, of course,
the apparatus which commands the
activities of the Vietcong.
There are two other “parties” active in
the NFLSV: the Radical Socialist Party,
formed in 1961 and composed chiefly of
intellectuals from urban centres, and the
Democratic Party, which dates from
1945 and is composed mainly of nation-
alists who joined in fighting against the
re-imposition of French colonialism. It
is of more than passing interest that
these two parties bear names markedly
similar to the only two parties, aside
from the Lao Dong Party itself, allowed
to exist in North Vietnam. In both
cases, these inconsequential groups are
designed to enlist the support of the
intellectuals and other potential leaders
who might have qualms about joining
the Communist Party. As with their
counterparts in the Chinese People's Re-
public, the term “party” is hardly more
than euphemistically applied.
An indication that the NFLSV was
little more than an artificial creation is
the fact that at its First Congress only
31 persons were named to the 52-man
Central Committee (21 places w'ere
“reserved’’), and these names were not
made public until more than a month
after the Congress adjourned. The
Australian pro - Communist journalist
Wilfred G. Burchett reports that more
than 100 delegates participated in the
Congress, but this hardly bears out his
contention that it represented the “real
cross-section of the population'’. Aside
from those named to the Central Com-
mittee, most of the other leaders at the
regional, provincial, district or village
levels where the Front claims to have
effective organisation have remained un-
identifiable. The top leaders, however,
have formidable records of actions in
support of Communist programmes over
many years. While some few are un-
doubtedly sincere nationalists, most of
them have clearly been willing to serve
the Lao Dong. On the other hand, the
members of the Central Committee of
the NFLSV do represent a wide variety
of talents.
Once the formal organisation of the
Front had been established, Hanoi began
to give full play to the activities which
were apparently conducted in its name.
By the time of the Second Congress of
the NFLSV in January, 1964. it was
claiming to be the representative of in-
numerable “liberation'’ groups and to
have effective government functions
operating at all levels in much of South
Vietnam. The various groups were in-
cluded to give the impression that the
Front represents all significant activities
and social strata within its area. There
are, for example, the Vietnam Loc Hoa
Buddhist Association, the Union of
Youth for the Liberation of South Viet-
nam. the Association*of Workers for the
Liberation of South Vietnam, and many
other similar groups. These groups are
kept in touch with corresponding organi-
sations of the International Communist
movement, and. through their activities,
statements and travels, receive publicity
and attention far in excess of their
weight and importance. Actually, the
groups seem to be primarily small staffs
with very little public participation, and
their representatives usually operate
from Hanoi.
Shortly after the announcement of the
creation of the NFLSV, its propaganda
arm, the Liberation News Agency
(LNA), appeared on the scene, and in its
wake a number of LNA radio stations
began to produce a steady diet of pro-
paganda for dissemination throughout
the South, playing up violence against all
activities of the Government of South
Vietnam as necessary “liberation”
activities and picturing the steady
growth of the “forces of national libera-
tion”. But once again it has been clear
that the direction comes from Hanoi.
The larger and more powerful network
of the North Vietnamese News Agency
quotes LNA broadcasts to insure inter-
national play, and LNA and NFLSV
propaganda publications are printed in
several languages in Hanoi by the
Government’s official publishing house

The growth in the operations of the
NFLSV has been significant in the four
years since it was formed. But this must
be understood against the background
of the guerrilla activities in South Viet-
nam which were designed to create a
vacuum in which the political growth
of the NFLSV could take place. The
formation of the Front was not an-
nounced until the leaders felt that the
initial two phases of the guerrilla strategy
had been carried out. First was the
building of the underground structure
and the training of a competent corps of
insurgents which began in 1954. Accord-
ing to Bernard Fall, the second phase,
that of insurgent violence, began in mid-
-1957. He notes:
Their target was simple and well-
chosen: the village official. In a coun-
try in which 80 per cent or more of
the population lives in 17,000 hamlets
spread over 8000 villages, the village
chief or secretary, and the “notables”
who make up the village council, are
the key links between the central
government and the people. Once
this line is broken by terror, “feed-
back” ceases and the central authori-
ties gradually become isolated from
the country at large.
This is, of course, part of the story of
what happened in mainland China.
Beginning in 1957, the Vietcong
launched a systematic campaign of ex-
termination of village officials. Almost
too ’ate to be of help, American advisers
in South Vietnam became aware of the
vacuum being created. President Ken-
nedy noted in May, 1961, that more
than 4000 village officials had been
killed in the preceding twelve months.
When this writer visited in the delta
region south of Saigon in the late sum-
mer of 1961, American advisers were
searching in vain for competent village
leaders willing and able to accept respon-
sibilities. Bernard Fall estimates that
by the end of 1963 perhaps as many as
13,000 'village officials had been killed
by the Vietcong. It is not difficult to
imagine how much larger was the figure
of those who had been intimidated or
persuaded to co-operate with the
NFLSV when it appeared on the scene
in 1961. Not that the assassination of
non-Communist administrators ceased
with the expansion of the activities of
the Front. The State Department's
“White Paper” estimated that, in 1964,
“436 South Vietnamese hamlet chiefs
and other Government officials were
killed outright by the Vietcong and
1131 were kidnapped”. Other targets of
the Vietcong terrorists included school
teachers, many of whom were kidnapped;
engineers, medical personnel and other
specialists. Along with their actions
against the natural leadership in South
Vietnam, the Communist insurgents used
demolitions against transport, communi-
cations, and electrical power facilities.
It was when this phase of operations was
judged to have been sufficiently success-
ful that the Lao Dong forces in the
South could bring into play the political'
arm of their strategy, the NFLSV.
Of course the political disarray in
Saigon since the overthrow of the Diem
regime has been custom-made for the
Communists and their Front. It has en-
couraged apathy and neutralism on the
part of the intellectuals and remaining
non-Communist leaders, including even
some of those who came from the North
and recognise only too clearly the
strategy being employed by Ho Chi-
minh’s forces. It has also encouraged
outsiders to conclude that perhaps the
NFLSV is the only group equipped to
provide a viable regime, and others to
accept the line that the conflict is a
result of internal causes. Then, too, the
anti-colonial, anti-Western propaganda
of the LNA has been aided by the in-
creasing number of American military in
South Vietnam and their continued con-
centration on the hardware aspects of
the struggle with inadequate attention to
necessary political organisation and re-
construction.
TTndoubtedly the manner in which the
NFLSV has been developed and por-
trayed has been designed to obscure the
preponderant role of Vietcong military
forces in creating chaos in the South
and the fact that they have been trained
in the North and ordered into the South
by the Communist regime in the North.
But the State Department “Blue Book”
of 1961 and its “White Paper” of 1965
document clearly the formidable nature
of the military assault against the Re-
public of Vietnam and the staffing and
direction of that assault from the North.
Whole military units and officers and
non-commissioned officers of others have
been moved from North Vietnam, but
their unit numbers and designations have
been changed to help maintain the fic-
tion that they operate under the direc-
tion of the Front. Captured documents
make clear, however, that the military
forces direct the activities of those who
adhere to the NFLSV in the South and
not vice versa.
It is doubtful whether the NFLSV
has nearly the amount of control over
the country which it claims. In the
“liberated” zones, of course, the Viet-
cong can point to everyone who co-
operates with them, rather than risking
his life, as a supporter of the NFLSV.
Both inside and outside the Communist-
controlled areas, however, the Front is
still probably too amorphous a group to
command allegiance of those who are
politically conscious or of the peasantry.
In 1965, the stiffening attitude of the
United States in support of the fight
against the Vietcong guerrillas began to
cause major concern among leaders of
the Front. Civilian political leaders* and
administrators were sent to South Viet-
nam along with military replacements.
The leaders of the NFLSV have used
foreign Communists and other reporters
to carry to the outside world the message
that the Front is already the effective
government for most of South Vietnam
and, of course, an indigenous move-
ment of the peoples of the South. In
September, 1963, Georges Chaffard,
correspondent for “Le Monde’ 9 , was
taken to interview one of the members
of the Central Committee of the
NFLSV. He reported that after his talk
he was no longer sure that the Front
was directed from the North.
One of the most prolific writers on
whom the NFLSV has relied to plead its
case around the world has been the Aus-
tralian, Wilfred G. Burchett. He has
already published two books, based on
travels within the guerrilla areas of
South Vietnam. He echoes the claims
by the NFLSV that it “is a government
in everything but name, with Commit-
tees of Military Affairs, External Affairs,
Public Health, Culture, Information and
Education, Post and Tele-Communica-
tions, Economic Affairs and others func-
tioning as ministries, with their various
departments and sub-departments”. And
after an interview with Nguyen Huu
Tho in December, 1964, Burchett
opined that “the question of transform-
ing the Front's Central Committee into
a provisional government is only a
question of time.”
Hanoi has joined in a major interna-
tional effort to publicise abroad the pro-
gramme and activities of the NFLSV as
a legitimate organisation of the people
struggling to free Vietnam from “neo-
colonialist and imperialist aggression”
and in this way to win for the Front the
sympathies of the newly emerged coun-
tries of Asia and Africa. At the time


the First Congress of the Front met in
February, 1962, Burchett reports that in
his opening address Dr Phung Van Cung
announced that the NFLSV had become
affiliated with the Afro-Asian Solidarity
Committee and the World Peace Coun-
cil. Since then, “representatives” of the
Front, operating out of Hanoi, have
been representing it at numerous Leftist
and Communist-sponsored conferences
abroad. A hard core of delegates is
kept in readiness in Hanoi where en-
trance and egress is easier.
As a part of its attempt to gain recog-
nition as a pro forma government for
South Vietnam, the NFLSV has estab-
lished at least seven permanent “mis-
sions” abroad which distribute its pro-
paganda handouts, arrange to participate
in regional meetings, and help to build
the image of the Front. Such “diplo-
mafic” representatives are stationed on
a permanent basis; for example, in Com-
munist China, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Cuba, and Algeria.
The NFLSV has received several sig-
nificant grants from foreign organisations,
mainly, of course, from within the coun-
tries of the Communist camp. As yet,
however, probably due to the impossibility
of establishing missions in Vietcong-con-
trolled areas on a permanent basis, no
foreign government has recognised the
NFLSV as the government of South
Vietnam.
Nevertheless, since the meeting of the
Second Congress of the Front in Janu-
ary, 1964, the major thrust of the pro-
nouncements from its LNA, of support-
ing statements from Hanoi, and of the
activities of the representatives abroad,
has been to portray the NFLSV as the
real government of South Vietnam. One
of the speakers at the Second Congress
FATHER AND DAUGHTER - VIETCONG VICTIMS
alleged that many governments in the
world already consider the Front to be
the “real government” and receive its
delegations as “real diplomatic envoys of
the State”. Burchett, in subsequent writ-
ings, picked up this theme, and referred
to “President Nguyen Huu Tho” as the
“c/e facto premier of most of South
Vietnam’ . Statements from LNA have
begun to stress those activities by the
NFLSV which would put it in the role
of a constructive and active administra-
tion dealing with economic problems,
education and “people's livelihood",
Although the Communist military
command in South Vietnam continues
to collect taxes, requisition supplies, and
supervise food production, this is now
all done under the nominal auspices of
the NFLSV. Vietcong political action
documents are also issued in the name
of the Front, and the Vietcong military
forces are officially referred to as an
arm of the NFLSV. By 1965, the
tempo of the campaign to portray the
Front as the cle facto government of
South Vietnam had picked up appreci-
ably. Burchett was referring to the
difficulties in administration for the
Front because of the increasing areas
falling under its control. Whereas
statements at the time of the First Con-
gress referred to NFLSV control of over
half of South Vietnam, when Hanoi re-
jected President Johnson’s offer of un-
conditional negotiations on April 19,
1965, it claimed that tfie Front con-
trolled over three-quarters of South Viet-
nam. The North Vietnamese regime
stated that “at the present time any
solution to the South Vietnam issue with-
out the decisive voice of the South Viet-
nam National Front lor Liberation is
impractical ".
The pretensions of the NFLSV to re-
present the people of South Vietnam
were given a boost through their parti-
cipation in the Indo-Chinese Conference
convened by Prince Sihanouk in Phnom
Penh, Cambodia, March 1 to 9, 1965.
The Front sent a 27-man delegation
headed by Huyn Tan Phat. Sihanouk
extended his warmest greetings to '‘the
living heroes, especially those of the
NFLSV”. By April 4, Hanoi was ex-
hibiting more confidence than ever about
the future of the NFLSV and hailed its
“political prestige, legal standing, and
comprehensively leading role”.
From the outset, there has never been
any doubt that the NFLSV is the crea-
tion of Ho Chi-minh's Lao Dong Party,
that it is itself under the control of the
Communists, that it is subordinate to the
Vietcong military commanders in the
South, or that it is just precisely what its
name indicates—a front. Yet, although
the real nature of the Front is well
known in South Vietnam, there can be
little question that since December,
1960, its influence, structure, organisa-
tion. and power have grown both intern-
ally and on the world scene. Although
the NFLSV obviously is not the govern-
ment of South Vietnam and does not yet
merit major attention in and of itself,
the foregoing should indicate that it
deserves constant scrutiny as part of the
larger framework of Communist revelu-
- tionary warfare.
The NFLSV reflects the strategic per-
spectives of Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi-
minh and an organisational and politi-
cally constructive side of a coin whose
obverse side is the strategy of terror and
guerrilla operations. The NFLSV. like
the Thailand Independence Movement,
reflects Communist ability at advance
planning, their appreciation of the power
of human organisation and discipline,
and the lessons learned from successful
campaigns in China and North Vietnam.
In response to this long-range strategic
perspective of the Communists, the
Government of South Vietnam and those
assisting it, mainly the United States,
have tended toward piecemeal measures,
and their councils have frequently been
divided. In his assessment of the situa-
tion in South Vietnam at the time of the
celebration of the 20th anniversary of
the Vietnam People’s Army in Hanoi on
December 22, 1964, General Vo Ngu-
yen Giap, the Communist victor at Dien
Bien Phu. predicted victory because of
the inability of the “imperialists” in the
political field and indicated that the
strategy used against the French was be-
ing applied in South Vietnam:
In the southern part of our country
the conditions for the struggle against
neo-colonialism and the US imperial-
ists’ special war are at once similar to
and different from the historical cir-


cumstances of the former resistance
war. Our southern people have an
extremely great political superiority;
they also have a tradition of and
experience in political and armed
struggle and of maintenance of very
high patriotism and very great revo-
lutionary enthusiasm. Meanwhile,
although the enemy is materially and
technically strong, the social base and
influence of his lackeys are extremely
weak. Therefore the enemy is in a
position of complete political isola-
tion; his political weakness is insur-
mountable.
As the Department of State’s 1965
“White Paper” pointed out, the record
of the politico-military aggression of
North Vietnam against the South is con-
clusive, and certainly the military thrust
of the aggression must be stopped.
Indeed, by April there were some small
indications that perhaps the determina-
tion on the part of the United States
to see the struggle through despite
criticism at home and among allies was
carrying some credibility in South Viet-
nam. Some bits, of intelligence data about
Vietcong dispositions were beginning to
come in the direction of the Govern-
ment forces. But the major question
was whether the South Vietnamese and
their American allies understood the
nature of the political weakness to which
General Giap referred.
Perhaps an indication of whether
Saigon and Washington can themselves
begin to operate with a larger political
perspective will be the manner in which
they handle the NFLSV’s pretensions
on the diplomatic scene and within
South Vietnam. The NFLSV line for
a neutral South Vietnam, with itself as
one of the major negotiating parties for
a “broad-based” neutral government in
the South and requiring the withdrawal
of United States forces, is an obvious
trap. The Vietcong would direct the
government which would be anything but
neutral, and their internal vengeance
would be severe. If the NFLSV can be
exposed for what it is and isolated on
the international scene, if the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam can develop con-
vincing alternate political organisation
and programmes, the combined strategy
of the united front and guerrilla war-
fare may yet be defeated. But will this
be asking for too much imagination and
change in Saigon and Washington?
Yet, as the plans for the Thailand
Independence Movement or Chinese
Communist operations in Africa make
only too clear, Mao Tse-tung’s strategy
of revolutionary warfare will continue
to be applied until it is manifest that it
can and will be defeated. The story of
the creation and development of the
NFLSV indicates that a great part of
a successful counter-strategy will lie in
the field of political organisation.
Down Mexico Way
The sun , the moon and Moreau
By DAVID McNICOLL
There are lots of gimmicks to air
travel these days. The planes from
New York to Mexico City have
Mexican stewards who carry on over the
inter-com with what some passengers
may regard as jokes and witty stories in
carefully scrambled English.
My companion and I were not in the
mood for hilarity, particularly pressurised
hilarity. Gilbert Swanson had been the
perfect host the night before, taking a
merry group first to that culinary Nir-
vana called Fountainbleu and later to Le
Club, the black and baroque discotheque
where New York's gay set rub navels till
the dawn lights the East River. Our mood
was not improved when we had to pose
for portraits taken by a stewardess this
is another piece of winged gimmickry:
they are printed and mounted and pre-
sented to each passenger within a few
minutes of the flash going off. They were,
mercifully, not in color.
Gilbert plunged himself into a balance
sheet of Campbell’s Soups, which seemed
to cheer him in an academic fashion. He
is a pretty substantial stockholder in the
big soup complex, having sold his family
food firm to Campbell for about one
hundred and fifty million dollars.
One of Gilbert Swanson’s “men in
Mexico” met us at the airport. Gilbert’s
fortune, though largely based in tucker,
has not been impaired by his acquisition
of the Volkswagen franchise in 19 Latin
American countries. This, mark you,
at a time when the emergence of a pro-
fessional-clerical-small business stratum
of relative affluence has made the sale of
small cars boom. The bell-boys who
decanted us and our baggage from a clut-
tered Volkswagen 1500 at the splendid
portals of the Maria Isabel had no clue
that they were dealing with a remarkably
well - fixed prospect. Their demeanor
changed noticeably as Gilbert checked
in and was handed the keys to one of the
Maria Isabel's most luxurious suites. A
bit of the deference even stuck to me as
I was shot skywards to my single on the
sixteenth.
It would be very easy in Mexico to
succumb to “ruin fatigue”, the malady
which strikes you after six hours at
Delphi and sends you gibbering out of
Athenian museums after having observed
your 500th noseless, armless and genital-
less statue. In Mexico they are digging
everywhere and ruins are coming up for
inspection almost daily as eager archaeo-
logists probe into the mysteries of that
ancient land. If you are athletic as well
as curious you can go to Teotihuacan
and inspect, and even climb, the pyra-
mids of the sun and moon. One pyra-
mid, the moon, was enough for me. I
gave the sun a brief nod and then sped
off to the Posada Piramides, at San Juan
Teotihuacan.
The Posada Piramides (a posada is, I
gather, a wayside inn) is owned by an
expatriate American, Frank Lowenstein,
and his wife. Some years ago they
bought the derelict old inn, and faithfully
restored it. Today it is a cool haven of
white-washed corridors, spotless tables,
cold wines, and a courtyard garden that
throbs gently with bees and birds and
bursting fruit.
Lowenstein has become a big figure in
Mexico. Apart from the posada his
hobbies are gems, animals and birds. His
settings for precious and semi-precious

stones are famous far beyond Mexico.
And his experiments in the breeding of
birds and animals has attracted the
attention of naturalists.
He has, for instance, revived success-
fully the breeding of the Esquencle, or
Mexican hairless dog. These strange
animals abound at the posada. They are
dirty grey in color, and their skin looks
like that of a smooth elephant. They are
true to label and completely hairless.
They average the size of a largish sheep-
dog and they bound w'ith the agility and
speed of a greyhound. I found them
interesting, but I could not be drawn to
them as I am to most dogs—nor could
I imagine myself eating them with any
relish —they were originally bred for the
table. 1 put the thought out of my mind
as I sat on the verandah of the posada
drinking tequila and munching straw-
berries.
It is astonishingly hard for the visitor
to Mexico to get Mexican food. The
locals seem to imagine you would never
want anything as rough and crude as
their bean dishes, their enchiladas, and
other rustic delicacies. My friend Ted's
wife Maria was Mexican and when we
travelled about I would ask her to order
the food of the district. In this way I
by-passed the Franco-American menus
down to the food of the country. But
if you go to the georgeous restaurants
of Mexico City you will be profifered
food and cooking of a type and quality
that you would encounter in the best
New York, London and Paris restaurants.
Mexico City's top restaurants are quite
superb in their appointments. There is
one in Chapultepec Park called El Lago
(the Lake) which, for sheer elegance,
is in world class. Its prices, also. Do
not for a moment think Mexico is a
bargain country. For good food and
drink they charge like w'ounded buffa-
loes. But in the night club-restaurants,
when you consider the floor show you
see, the charges are quite reasonable.
The best place I found was Los Globos
(the Balloons) where I saw an Aztec
dance, every performer with blazing
torches on his and her head, which was
as marvellous as it was dangerous. And
at the same place I heard an orchestra,
of six xylophones, three saxes and a
drum, called the Hermanos Fernandez
which was one of the best nightclub acts
1 have ever encountered.
After three or four days in Mexico
City you start to relax. Your breathing
becomes normal and you stop gasping
after a length of the hotel pool. You
learn to disregard the tourist taxi at your
hotel door and to take the communal
taxis which run right up the Reforma,
and deposit you anywhere you like for
one peso (about 8 American cents).
You find that nobody wants to take you
down, molest you, or try to interest you
in his sister. You become imbued with
the wonderful warmth and graciousness
of the huge city and you marvel at the
control of the ceaseless mass of cars,
buses, taxis, cycles, trams and trolley
buses which scream, jolt and glide hour
by hour up and down the graceful tree-
lined avenues.
My forays out of Mexico City were
with John Alius, Central American head
of United Press. We would scream off
in his cream Mustang, the suburbs falling
away behind us and our breathing be-
coming easier as we dropped from the
heights down towards the coast. If you
parachuted into Mexico you might easily
imagine yourself in Australia—the same
colors, the same grey-brown trees. Only
the cactus gives the game away. Plus
the peons and their pitiful little donkeys,
and the peasant women and children
standing beside the road proffering you
neatly-bound iguanas to take home for
your supper.
As happy as birds
npAXCO, the silver town, clings like a ter-
A rifled child to the side of a mountain.
It is a mad little place of cobbled streets
and impossible corners, of shrines and
shops and fruit stalls, and in the middle
of it all the most Mexican-looking town
square you could imagine with an ancient
church and cool green trees.
Much as I liked Taxco, it faded beside
Cuernavaca. This town is about an hour
or so from Mexico City and about 2000
feet lower down. It is greatly favored
as a weekend resort for the rich of the
capital—many people, in fact, drive in
and out every day. There is an excite-
ment about Cuernavaca. The plazas
w'ith the vendors, the children playing,
the fountains splashing, the Indians who
have walked and ridden to town, shyly
showing their primitive bark paintings.
The three-piece brass bands, bravely
strident and keeping an eye out for the
police who are sensitive to the demands
for noise abatement. The shops with
their stoles and clay figurines and crude
wooden bulls. And everyone minding
their own business and happy as birds.
No wonder Bardot and Moreau have
fallen for Cuernavaca—Bardot said it's
the first time she's been able to walk
down a street without being stared at or
asked for an autograph.
There is a restaurant-hotel at Cuerna-
vaca called Las Mananitas which, by
itself, would make the visit worthwhile.
You step off a dusty street, into a dark

slightly from all the Taylor-Burton-
Gardner drama when “Night of the
Iguana” was filmed at Puerto Vallarta.
One of my most memorable days in
Mexico was on the set of “Viva Maria”,
which is being made in various locations
in the country and the cities. When I
was there, the unit was filming at the
big Estudio Churabusco in one of the
suburbs of Mexico City.
“Viva Maria” has brought together
two of France’s best-known actresses
Brigitte Bardot and Jeanne Moreau.
Bardot is 30, still devastatingly attractive,
warm and as kittenish as advertised.
Bid Moreau! There is a woman. She
exudes a magic, an enchantment which
has to be experienced to be believed.
She is not beautiful, but her lustrous,
deep brown eyes bore through you and
her face, as she talks, is vivacity, humor
and wisdom all rolled into one. Beside
her, Bardot became a schoolgirl.
The director of the film is the famous
Louis Malle, a former lover of Moreau’s.
He was married while I was in Mexico,
his bride a lovely French model. Moreau
did not go to the wedding, although she
did show up at a studio celebration
party a few days later. Moreau's con-
stant companion is the great French
couturier Pierre Cardin, who, until
Moreau, had not exhibited a romantic
interest in women. He is her greatest
triumph. Bardot’s current boy-friend
(a Moroccan of Jewish extraction living
in Brazil!), was never far from her side.
As I watched her undress in one of
the scenes and saw the popping eyes of
the Mexicans, I sympathised with Bar-
dot's boy-friend. It must be a position
of great strain.
There are lots of things one is supposed
to do in Mexico which I failed to do.
I did not go to the bullfights, even to see
the great El Cordobes perform, because
I got bull-fighting out of my system
years ago. 1 did not go to Acapulco
because I can lie in the sun at Bondi.
But 1 spent a full day in the Museum of
Anthropology, and hours in Chapultepec
Castle and unravelling the Diego de
Rivera murals at the Presidential Palace.
And I went to the races in the Jockey
Club stand at the Hippodromo de las
Americas and lost my pesos in a happy
blur of spotless napery and superb food
and long tequilla drinks spiced with
honey.
If you are interested in houses and
architecture, Mexico City’s posh suburbs
are full of magic. In one new suburb—
“ The Nightingales”—the houses would
send Roy Grounds and George Molnar
into ecstasies. And the houses of such
people as Merle Oberon Pagliai, and the
famous Cantinflas, and Dr Arturo Milhe,
president of the Jockey Club (deer in the
garden) reach an elegance and opulence
somewhat dazzling to the colonial boy.
I am afraid that I have given the im-
pression that Mexico is luxury and
glamor and riches. Of course it is not.
There ( is grinding poverty, there is
hunger.
But Mexico is progressing towards the
good life faster than her neighbors to
the south. Her industries are booming,
living standards are rising, and American
investment grows year by year.
Interest in Australia is keen. The

Mexico City means that each week
dozens of Australians descend on the
country and spend time there. It should
not be long before Mexico has diploma-
tic representation in Australia and vice
versa. The present system of part-time
consuls is hopelessly inadequate.
A couple of after-thoughts have come
to me. I met my first armament dealer
in the bar of the Maria Isabel. A be-
spectacled, smiling American in process
of buying 16 Vampire jets from Mexico
and selling them to Santo Domingo. He
talked of the sale of old tanks, machine
guns and ammunition with the same dedi-
cation as if he were selling wheat to a
starving nation.
The other after-thought. Alsatians are
the most popular dogs in Mexico City
and sell by the hundred. They are used
to guard homes, a supplement to the
barred windows and high locked gates
which are standard in the suburbs. I
asked some of my Mexican friends if
burglary was a particular problem. Yes,
they said, quite bad. But the dogs and
they said, quite bad. But the dogs and
aspirants getting at the servant girls.
The Money Badger
As hairy-chested as Hemingway
From JAMES MURRAY in London
Standing in his cork-lined workroom,
looking over Hyde Park, American
author Robert Ruark spoke of his
hunger for far horizons. “I must have
huge vistas. There was something about
that big sprawling country,” he
sketching distance in the air with his
glass of pink gin.
He vas talking about Africa, of course,
specifically Kenya, in which he is now
Yankee non grata, following the publica-
tion in 1962 of his novel “Uhuru”. “I’m
not sour on Africa. Africa is sour on
me,” he said.
But the 49-year-old Ruark may seek
the distance and space he craves in Aus-
tralia. “I’ve been there before, love the
country, love the people and I would
certainly like to go back,” he said.
What prevents him hopping on a jet
is the hefty manuscript of his latest novel
“The Honey Badger”, whose adjectives
he is shining up for its publication .in
September. With his fondness for in-
congruously winsome fly-leaf notes,
Ruark has written the following for his
fourth novel: “This book is for all the
nice girls who wittingly or unwittingly
supplied the vital statistics without which
there would be no book.”
And if anyone objects chauvinistically
that adjectives pan be shined as gleam-
ingly anywhere in Australia as in a Park
Lane apartment, Ruark has an answer:
“It’s not enough to just write books any
more. You've got to be on the spot to
merchandise them. A book means total
involvement.”
Just what he means, he makes clear.
First of all, he was as generous with his
own vital statistics in writing the book
as the nice girls were. There is a great
deal of himself in the new book’s central
character a rumbustious writer.
Divorced five years ago, after 21 years
of marriage (settlement 500,000 dollars),
Ruark chose the honey badger, an animal
which always attacks its enemy’s groin,
as a symbol of American womanhood’s
instinct to castrate its men.
“All American woman are guilty of
honey badgering. Among them it has
been made into a cult. They are always
chopping off a guy’s long pants at the
knees so to speak,” he said.
Wandering through his flat, decorated
with his hunting trophies, Ruark ex-
panded on this basic premise with the
easy familiarity of someone talking to
his long-time analyst. “I fought with my
mother, hated my old lady. She wrecked
my father, destroyed her brother and
tried to destroy me but I was meaner.
Last Christmas, T told her I thought she
was the most unpleasant woman I had
ever met. She said: ‘l’ve got news for
you. I hate you too. I always have’ ”
It is this unworqanly bitterness which
Ruark has tried to capture in “The Honey
Badger”. He did not, however, content
himself with diving into his own Oedipus
to get it. Five women friends spent a
year at Ruark’s other home on Spain’s
Costa Brava helping him with research
into the nature of women.
“I have nightmares about what I now
know,” claimed Ruark with what must
be regarded for him as understatement.
You might think that a year’s research
of this nature might have called for
grants from the Rockefeller Foundation
and the Gulbenkian Foundation. Hardly.
Ruark’s agent negotiated for him an
advance of 100,000 dollars on the
strength of a 27-page synopsis of “The
Honey Badger”.
Sitting in the living room of his flat,
eyed by a leopard he had shot, he totted
up his earnings from his three other
novels, his 1500 magazine pieces and his
average of four syndicated columns a
week from 1946 to 1964. He estimated
that he has made three million dollars
from his typewriter, including a million
dollars from the book and film “Some-
thing of Value”, published in 1955 and
based on the Mau Mau troubles.
“See what I mean by merchandising.
Forget the masterpieces. I need the
dough,” he said.
He was at pains to recall what Ernest
Hemingway said to him about those
critics who compare their works
usually to Ruark’s disadvantage.
“As near as 1 recall, Ernest said, ‘You
don’t write as well as my best but you’re
better than my worst. Forget the critics
because if they could write they would
not be critics. And forget the second-
hand Hemingway bit. We have both got
some hair on our chests but each of us
is living in a different dimension. Forget
the invidious comparison’.”
Ruark is generous in his admission that
Hemingway has greatly influenced him
and cites, surprisingly, Somerset Maug-
ham and John Steinbeck as two other
writers from whom he has derived in-
spiration. About him there is a quality of
outrageous aimiability. He summed him-
self up:
“I am a man of large energy and
small talent. I am a great pro-writer but
genius dwells not in me. I am a very
good, competent, pro-mediocre writer.
But none of this great tour de bloody
force stuff for me.”

The Box with Billions

The Identi-Kit men
Identi-Kit pictures of three men wanted for questioning in the still unsolved murder of two schoolgirls
at Wanda Beach, Sydney, earlier this year.
By GORDON HAWKINS
TThe recent publication in the Press
throughout Australia of composite
Identi-Kit pictures of individuals wanted
for questioning by the police in connec-
tion with the Wanda Beach murders have
not yet produced useful results. By co-
incidence, under such headings as
SHOCK GAOL ATTACK, another vio-
lent crime story in which Identi-Kit
played a significant part, was in the news.
Reporters after giving piquant details of
the latest assault on a fellow prisoner
(“tried to mutilate him with his bare
hands”) have taken the opportunity to
recall the history of the “Sydney Muti-
lator’’ case.
It is perfectly natural that this bizarre
series of murders should excite the con-
tinued interest, yet to the student of
police science, it represents a landmark
of another kind. For the Brennan/
Macdonald arrest came as the result of
the first successful use by the New South
Wales police of the Identi-Kit system of
visual identification. The apprehension
of the murderer resulted directly from the
publication of composite pictures pre-
pared by this method.
The nature of this achievement is bet-
ter recognised in the USA than here in
Australia. Courtney Owens who is
manager of the Identi-Kit Division of the
Townsend Company which leases Identi-
Kit to law enforcement agencies through-
out the world, wrote recently:
“We are extremely proud of the
professional application of the Identi-
Kit System by Australian law enforce-
ment. These men have not had the
advantage of in-person instruction as
have most Identi-Kit operators in other
parts of the world. They have had to
learn this System (both concept and
application) via correspondence. . . .
Nevertheless, it has become quite
apparent that their assimilation and
field application of the Identi-Kit
System is as practical and effective as
anywhere in the world.”
The Identi-Kit system, now well into
its sixth year and used by more than 600
police forces throughout the world, has
been termed “the greatest practical aid
to identification since the introduction of
the fingerprint system". Like Alphonse
Bertillon, the 19th century pioneer of
identification techniques, its inventor is
a man whose life's work has been crime
detection. Indeed, 50-year-old Hugh
Macdonald, who first conceived the idea
of “facial fingerprinting” over 20 years
ago, whilst working in the Los Angeles
Bureau of Identification, is still serving
as a police officer.
For years he worked at dissecting
hundreds of facial photographs into com-
ponent parts, trying to sort and break
them down into a limited number of
basic types. But the large scale photo-
graphy involved exhausted his financial
resources and by 1953 he had accepted
defeat. In that year, however, a repre-
sentative of the Townsend Company of
California offered him financial and
technical assistance. Thereafter, a team
of hired assistants collected 50,000
photographs from all parts of the world
and then devoted themselves to measur-
ing, comparing, analysing and classifying
the pictures in order to establish stand-
ard patterns.
The system finally produced consists
of a series of approximately 550 lettered
and numbered plastic transparencies of
eyes, noses, mouths, chins, age lines, etc.
From these master components it is pos-
sible to produce more than 62 billion
different composite portraits—that is 20
times the world's population. By this
method the verbal descriptions of wit-
nesses are built into pictorial form as
the appropriate slides are assembled into
a plastic “sandwich".
It was first put to use in Los Angeles
in 1959 and has already aided in the
solution of hundreds of crimes through-
out the world. The New South Wales
police have made many successful identi-
fications with it since the Brennan case
and it is also used by the Victorian
police. One advantage of the system is
that each composite picture carries its
own letter-number code which can be
transmitted interstate or internationally
by telegraph or telephone for simple re-
construction at the receiving end.
Another, is that it works (as fingerprints
do not) just as well with offenders with
no criminal records as with known cri-
minals. Moreover, it is portable, being
Alan Edward Brennan, the "Sydney mutilator"
whose arrest resulted entirely from the publica-
tion of these composite pictures prepared with
the Identi-Kit system. The similarity between
the photographs and the Identi-Kit pictures is
striking despite the fact that Brennan, after
being recognised in Sydney, dyed his hair black
and combed it forward to his receding hairline.

packaged in a box weighing only six
pounds which can be carried to the
scene of the crime or wherever a victim
or witness is available.
At their General Assembly in 1962,
INTERPOL received the report of an
expert police committee on the Identi-
Kit system but were characteristically
cautious in their conclusions. They re-
solved that: “Such systems may prove
an aid in investigation and in solving
crimes.” The use of the plural is due
to the fact that a number of other visual
identification systems are in use. Thus
the French Police have the Chabot
Photo-Robot system which works by
assembling cut-outs from photographs.
The New York Police have developed
what they call a Variable Image Reflec-
tor. Yet the former has the disadvant-
age that it is only local or regional in
scope, and the latter is not portable but
a rather cumbersome piece of studio or
laboratory equipment. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police also have a
Facial Identification Kit but experts say it
has many shortcomings when compared
with Identi-Kit. One of the most inter-
esting developments is a Japanese system
whereby transparencies are projected and
the composite picture built up on a
screen.
/Critics of the Identi-Kit complain that
it is not sufficiently flexible and does
not —as Photo-Robot, for example, does
—produce a toned photographic likeness
but only a flat, crude impression. This is
undeniable but ignores the fact that the
system was not designed to provide por-
traits of individuals but rather to build
types of faces only and to approach the
problem of identification by way of eli-
mination. The object is merely to pro-
duce a composite picture which will nar-
row the field of suspects to a specific
type of person. To this extent, brash
claims sometimes made by operators
(“We know our man is in the box; all
we have to do is get him out”) are mis-
leading. Yet a case was recently re-
ported in which the likeness was so near
the criminal's actual appearance that it
raised goose flesh on the victim.
The use of Identi-Kit is not confined to
straightforward identification. Operators
are instructed that it may produce in-
direct results not envisaged when it was
originally designed. An interesting
example of this occurs in a report from
New York State last year. For over a
year and a half, one district in the city of
Syracuse had been plagued with a “prow-
ler”. Police received as many as six calls
to one home in a night. One witness,
a seventeen-year-old youth, claimed that
he had seen and chased the prowler at
different times and twice been assaulted
by him. Finally this witness was brought
in to help with an Identi-Kit composite.
Following the normal routine a portrait
was built up by the operator on the basis
of the witness' verbal description. The
witness takes no part in this preliminary
picture-building but is then shown the
completed composite and asked to study
it and suggest changes. In this case the
witness suggested 27 changes not con-
sistent with his original description of the
prowler. Briefly, it soon became clear
that the youth was lying and he finally
broke down and confessed that he was
himself the prowler. Prior to this he had
not been considered as a possible suspect.
Details of such cases as this are circu-
lated to lessees throughout the world.
Indeed the lease arrangement was adopt-
ed to facilitate the flow of information
and maintain uniformity within the
system as well as ensuring the provision
of improvements as introduced and the
exchange of damaged parts. At the end of
last year sets of 10 new transparencies
were received in Melbourne and Sydney.
Today international acceptance, usage
and growth of the Identi-Kit system
throughout the world have made it a
standard and necessary tool for all police
forces. Publicity given to the Brennan
case was a major factor in securing this
acceptance.

COALS TO NEWCASTLE...
Heavy industry in Australia began at Newcastle, the great steel city of New
South Wales. The rich black coal of adjacent fields was the vital fuel for fur-
naces whose continuing clamour was the lusty voice of progress. Coals to New-
castle were the passwords to progress.
Today, on a vast and dramatic scale, the
Railways of Australia are taking coals to
many Newcastles from Leigh Creek to
Port Augusta, from Collie to Perth and
Fremantle, from Yallourn to Melbourne,
Corrimal to Port Kembla, Moura to Glad-
stone . . . ore concentrates from Mt. Isa to
Townsville, from Broken Hill to Port Pirie
and to Cockle Creek, from Cobar to Port
Kembla . . . bauxite from Jarrahdale to
Kwinana. Soon the mile-long iron ore
trains will be rolling in Western Australia
from Koolyanobbing and Mt. Golds-
worthy and the Hamersley Ranges.
Coals to Newcastle? The ability of railways
to move bulk freights quickly, efficiently and
economically is of tremendous importance
to Australia. A strong, virile and integrated
railway system, at a time when other
nations are seeking our raw materials, is,
and remains the surest guarantee of our
future progress.

Backward,
Christian Soldiers!
The Reformation incubating in Rome
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
Some future historian, I suppose, will
one day survey this curious time of
ours with the ironic detachment
of a Gibbon. He is to be envied. What
a rare harvest awaits him! always, of
course, assuming that we do not, in
obedience to the death-wish which seems
to possess us, destroy ourselves and all
our records. Even if the records survive
they will, in any case, be difficult to
make out. Such a vast accumulation of
lies and slanted information! How will
it all ever be disentangled? A resident
newspaper correspondent in Moscow
was asked by a wide-eyed visiting Leftist,
when Stalin’s purges were in full swing,
how far the court proceedings were to
be believed. Everything was true, he
replied, except the facts. It might be
our epitaph.
My future historian will certainly
want to devote a chapter, if not a
volume, to the Christian churches in the
mid-20th century. Their performance is
bound to strike him as hilarious. They
were funny enough when with crazy
gallantry they tried to defend the Book
of Genesis against Darwin’s panzers;
they are even funnier now that, belatedly,
they have decided to join the army of
progress just when it is in total disarray,
if not in headlong retreat.
Towards the end of the last century
it would have seemed only too obvious
that Christian institutions which bowed
to the prevailing evolutionary current
had the best chance of survival. Let
them jettison their more ludicrous dogma
and ceremonial, and take their place in
the vanguard of progress; as it were, sell
out their Heavens for what they would
fetch and buy in Earths on a rising
market. Then they could be sure of
finding themselves on the winning side.
As things have turned out, it is “en-
lightened” sects like the Unitarians who
have withered on the vine, not “obscur-
antist” Roman Catholicism. The Little
Bethels are closing down, but the Scarlet
Woman, drunk with the blood of the
Saints, has unaccountably thriven in the
age of science and enlightenment. Shaw
is today more dated than St Paul, and
poor old Wells turned his face to the
wall and cried his eyes out in “Mind at
the End of its Tether” just because the
atom had been split, when he of all
people should have offered thanks. Walt
Whitman, Edward Carpenter, William
Morris how far, far away their voices
sound, whereas the crowning of a Pope
attracts almost as many viewers as a
royal occasion and rates a Dimbleby
commentary.
My historian would find this state of
affairs highly diverting I am sure. His
astonishment would be all the greater
that the Roman Catholic Church itself,
having witnessed the ruinous con-
sequences to its Protestant rivals of com-
pounding with contemporary trends,
should now seem set upon following a
like course. Just when the Reformation
'appears to be finally fizzling out, another,
it seems, is incubating in Rome. The
Church’s profound pessimism about
human life, miraculously preserved
through the long false dawn of science,
is about to be shed at the precise his-
torical moment that it is most relevant
and most urgently needed to save men’s
reason, if not their souls.
Pessimism is, indeed, Christianity’s
great strength, and the reason for its
survival. The concept of this world as
a wilderness, and of human life as short
and brutish, fits the circumstances of
most people most of the time. The con-
trary proposition—that earthly life can
be satisfying within its own dimensions
and on its own terms leads to such
mental strain and confusion as to be
scarcely tenable, other than briefly and
artificially. The kingdom of heaven in
heaven may be a dubious proposition,
but through the centuries it has appealed
both to sophisticates like St Augustine
and Pascal, and to all the simple-hearted
who, legitimately disappointed with their
lives here on earth, pin their hopes in a
future beatitude beyond the grave.
If the kingdom of heaven on earth has
dawned for us now, it is necessary to
regard this age as exceptionally and in-
creasingly humane, when in point of
fact it has evidently been notable for
slaughter, cruelty and destruction on a
scale rarely, if ever, exceeded in history.
We have to offset the Health Service
against Hitler’s gas-chambers, the Third
Programme against the wanton destruc-
tion of many of the finest products of
our civilisation like the city of Dresden,
Parks of Culture and Rest against the
monstrous annihilations of Stalin,
UNESCO against the millions of dis-
placed persons (that blood-curdling term,
itself an emanation of a lost mind reach-
ing after a lost soul).
Above all, we have to persuade our-
selves that we are happy. This is the
most difficult and sanity - destroying
operation of all. The psychiatric wards
are full of patients guiltily conscious of
having failed to be happy. The ever-
increasing numbers of the mentally sick
(20 million now, reportedly, in America,
the happiest land) have cracked under
the strain. Scandinavian happiness (an-
other happy land, portrayed by Ingmar
Bergman) often seems to fall out of the
window.
Deliverance from happiness would
seem to be the greatest need of mankind
today, and the Christian churches an
ideal instrument for bringing it about.
The New and Old Testaments are full
of the hopelessness of looking for any-
thing but tribulation in this world, and
the senses stand condemned as gross
deceivers which enslave and ruin their
addicts. We are to die in the flesh to
be reborn in the spirit. One may carry
so sublime a notion around with one
like the picture of a loved face, taking
it out from time to time to look at it
with sick longing.
Yet, strangely enough, just at this
moment when, of all others, such a
message is desperately needed, the trend
in the Christian churches is all the other
way. One may, perhaps, leave out of
account the Anglican Church, which has
long been an object of derision. If it
were to be disestablished it would be
seen to have practically ceased to exist.
Its lovely edifices are falling into decay;
its superb “Book of Common Prayer”
scarcely redeems its shambling services;


its clergy are, for the most part, forlorn
and negligible. Words cannot convey
the doctrinal confusion, ineptitude and
sheer chicanery of the run-of-the-mill
incumbent, with his confusion of the
Christian faith with better housing,
shorter hours of work and the United
Nations.
Squalid human family
the Roman Catholic Church
should now have embarked on the
same road strikes a Protestant as more
surprising. Through the years it has main-
tained its position, refusing to be stam-
peded by the claims and pretensions of
an increasingly materialist world. Its
position, including its opposition to con-
traception, always seemed to me, accord-
ing to its own terms of reference, wholly
logical and sound. Nor am I much im-
pressed by the breast-beating among
non-Christians over the woes of ex-
cessive child-bearing. Far deeper and
more ignominious suffering comes of
sterility. Moreover, my historian (return-
ing to him for a moment) will surely
note as a highly bizarre circumstance the
fact that the strongest demand for birth
control should have come precisely when
the possibilities in the way of food pro-
duction are seen to be virtually illimit-
able, and when the whole universe is
about to be opened up, providing space
to accommodate a million million times
our present squalid little human family.
The Roman Catholic Church is the
one remaining, as it has been far and
away the strongest, bastion of Christen-
dom. If it is now crumbling (as seems
to be the case), and in process of
succumbing to the siren voices of
material and fleshly well-being wafted
across the Atlantic, then the game is
finally up. The long, tortuous path
through history of this truly remarkable
institution will have ended at last; the
story which began so strangely and
momentously in Palestine 2000 years
ago has finally lost its power to shape
and animate our human destiny. Afflu-
ence broadening down from hire-pur-
chase payment to hire-purchase payment
will not salvage it, nor the best of all
possible birth pills down the most
amenable of all possible gullets, nor
more and better education, nor even
votes for teenagers, nor any of the other
panaceas which have been or will be
proffered. A light will have gone out
which has illumined all our lives, shone
through the art and literature of a long
civilisation, and served to hold at bay,
if only fitfully and inadequately, the wild
appetites to gorge and dominate which
afflict all our hearts.
Letters to the Editor
Trouble-Makers
SlR.—One of the most disquieting, and
as far as I know unremarked upon,
aspects of the Knopfelmacher affair has
been the readiness to characterise a man
as “mad”, “mentally unbalanced”, “para-
noid” and so on. To their discredit even
some psychologists have gone in for this,
simultaneously accusing Dr Knopfel-
macher of using language loosely and
slandering his opponents.
This way of going on may involve
something more sinister than mere exag-
geration, carelessness and lying. In fact
the most serious thing about it may have
been that this opinion was quite honestly
held. As Barbara Wootton demonstrated
in her “Social Science and Social Patho-
logy”, the concepts of mental health and
illness, at least as defined by many
authorities, lean heavily on the notion of
adjustment to, or harmony with, social
norms. A person who is “well adjusted”
to prevailing norms, is mentally healthy,
one who is “badly adjusted” is mentally
unhealthy (unbalanced, mad).
As Lady Wootton points out, such a
way of looking at things produces prob-
lems; “For one thing, if such definitions
are consistently applied, they are liable
in certain social environments to produce
violent conflicts between health and
morals. As she goes on to argue, many
of the accepted definitions would allow a
wholehearted Nazi to qualify as a men-
tally healthy person in a Nazi-controlled
society. He would be a well-adjusted
personality.
The corollary of this is a tendency to
regard non-conformists, rebels and eccen-
trics as being mentally ill and unbalanced.
In the case of Dr Knopfelmacher this
tendency has been demonstrated. In
private discussions, at least, the shift from
saying “Knopfelmacher is a trouble-
maker" to saying “Knopfelmacher is un-
balanced” seems to have been a minor
one.
The dangers of such an equation are
self-evident. But if someone should need
convincing there is to hand the example
of the Soviet Union. There, the current
practice is to treat intellectuals who do
not conform to official norms not as
criminals but as lunatics. They are sent
not to gaols but to asylums. This is
known as liberalisation. Anyone wishing
to judge whether the intellectuals deserve
to be treated as madmen might read the
excerpts from the novel “Ward 7” by
Valeriy Tarsis, currently being published
in the London “Observer”. He is one of
them.

Cuckoos and Abbots
SlR.—While Anthony Brown has given
us a very interesting article on Morris
West and the now resolved question of
“Who Killed the Cuckoo?” (8., May 15),
1 should like to object to his saying that
the poor old Cuckoo ruled his nation
“with all the craft and capacity for mur-
der of some mediaeval abbots”. What
abbots? Neither in the Middle Ages, nor
before nor after, have abbots been noted
either for craft or for murderous capaci-
ties. Quite the contrary. Why the silly
comparison? I have read long and care-
fully in medieval history. Keen, Bloch,
Hay, Knowles, Christopher Dawson and
others say nothing at all about such
abbatical propensities. On what is Mr
Brown relying?
MARTIN HALEY

The Scalpel
SlR.—The article by Mr Sam Lipski (8.,
May 15) ably describes a problem that
besets the medical profession today.
However, I would agree with the spokes-
man for the Royal College of Surgeons
“that no good purpose would be served”
by the article as suggested to the College.
A greater problem today than question-
able surgical ability is a change in patient-
doctor relationship.
“Who Wields the Scalpel?” will
probably not produce any vast changes
in medical education, either before or
after graduation. I doubt that the annual
Congress of the AMA will be swayed in
its deliberations regarding registration of
specialists.
“Who Wields the Scalpel?” will cer-
tainly reduce, in a large number of
people, the confidence that they have in
their general practitioner. There is an
ugly suggestion in the phrases “having a
go”, “keeping their hand in”, “financial
interests prevent them from putting the
problem”, Surely nothing could more
undermine the confidence of a patient!
Does Mr Lipski know’ that if he
should drive from Sydney to Mel-
bourne via the Princes Highway, once
he leaves Wollongong, he will not
have the benefit of a specialist sur-
geon until he arrives at Bairnsdale? A
number of road and other accidents
occur in this extensive area; these are
dealt with by general practitioners. It
does not need a Bulletin article to tell
these doctors that some patients need
specialist care. The cases flown to Syd-
ney and other centres at times are not
flown out to provide exciting copy for
the daily Press! In many country
towns the local doctors are assisted by
visiting specialists, for routine and at
times for emergency cases.
If it was considered that present
training is inadequate to enable some
surgery to be undertaken, then surely
Mr Lipski should stay in Sydney to
have his coronary thrombosis, diabetic
coma, cerebral vascular catastrophe,
haematemesis from his duodenal ulcer
and other such medical emergencies.
These problems and other medical, sur-
gical, traumatic and obstetrical emergen-
cies are dealt with by general practi-

Who discovered SINGAPORE?
We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn’t cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
FOOD Singapore is a kitchen to the world!
A person can eat just so much in four days—but with all this pageant of
sumptious dishes, where do you start —or stop!? Malay satay a la genuine
thing—with tamarind and spices beaten and mixed for hours on end, to give
you a relishing feast. Chinese food is a way of life! We sat down to 12
courses last night. Each one a wonder of exotic tastes. Then there are the
stimulating Indian muslim foods, spicy and aromatic. There is an endless
variety of the world’s best European food served in the many seaside night
clubs and palm fringed modern hotels.

will always be dealt with in this way! The,
answer is not regimentation, licensing for
specific work, but providing adequate
post-graduate training facilities and
making available to general practitioners
the modern equipment which is available
to specialist practitioners.
In the meanwhile, let me assure Mr
Lipski and other intending travellers that
it is indeed safe to venture on the country
highways and byways, and that if they are
unfortunate to become ill, they have a
chance of returning home, even indeed
with a little money in their pockets.
Dr K. M. Doust
U Ucid nil a (NSW).
SIR. — Sam Lipski's article publicises a
viewpoint of one whose interests and
experience are confined to a specialty.
Those who practise medicine (in its
general sense) know that efficiency is
greatest when satisfactory treatment can
be given by the doctor of first choice,
who is necessarily a general practitioner.
Precisely because patients are persons
and not just economic units this personal
physician is free to advise and treat his
patients in hospital and retains an over-
all perspective, seeking advice from con-
sultants on more specialised aspects when
he sees fit. Australian patient? under-
stand this, prefering to “go privately” so
as to remain under the care of their “own
doctors”. Where the personal physician
cannot manage his own patient in hos-
pital we see the seething discontent
evidenced in the correspondence columns
of the British Medical Press and the
emigration of one third of medical
graduates since the nationalisation of the
English medical profession. The re-
sponsible young graduate having been
well trained in medical theoly seeks
resident training posts usually for two
years, where he acquires the basic prac-
tical skills necessary in treatment. This
includes the performance of the simpler
operations and the management of
patients who have undergone extensive
surgery. He learns that the elite have
their failures and that manual dexterity
is of less importance than clinical judg-
ment.
Mr Lipski’s quotation of “three times
as much chance of your complaint re-
curring, five times as much chance of
post-operative complication, and ten
times the chance of dying as you would
have if I sent you to Sydney” is the pro-
duct of an irresponsible imagination.
References to “Bread and Butter surgery”
(not a GP term), and accusations that
the profit motive is paramount, reflect the
attitude of him who makes them. Valid
objection could be raised to anyone,
however specialised, operating beyond
his competence, but there is no legislating
for common sense or integrity.

wrote extremely well about a subject
which, I feel, should neither be con-
demned nor condoned. What is wrong
with controlled homosexuality between
consenting parties? Whether we like it or
not, homosexuality is here to stay. So
why can't so-called civilised members of
our society accept the homosexual who
has an insistent yearning to express his
sexual emotions. Isn’t it better to allow
him to express such love to another con-
senting male in private instead of fre-
quenting public toilets and parks, being
easy “prey” for our police forces? I say
let’s adopt a more civilised and under-
standing attitude towards homosexuality.
No doubt I will come under a torrent of
criticism from many people for expres-
sing such views. Perhaps there are others
who feel they would like to come for-
ward and support me in my quest for a
better deal for the homosexual.

Ceylon’s Elections
SIR.—My major criticisms of Dr Bares’
article on Ceylon remain, despite his
reply (8., May 1). In particular 1 adhere
to the word “bribery” in describing a
massive resumption of aid after the
election of Dudley Senanayake. The
Americans made the initial mistake of
stopping aid in reprisal for the nationali-
sation of petrol stations, surely a permis-
sible act by a sovereign government des-
perately short of foreign exchange.
Everyone knows in Ceylon politics that
such Chinese aid as is given is designed
to impress the country with China’s
benevolence. Everyone also knows that
an immediate resumption of US aid
would have much the same object. The
Ceylonese are not Pavlovian dogs, saliva-
ting at gifts. The basis of the present
Ceylon welfare state was not laid by
the Bandaranaikes, though many changes
in detail were. The rice subsidy, general
education and the free hospital services,
the three pillars of the welfare system,
were all in existence long before 1956.
One should note that the United National
Party promised not only to retain the
system but also to retain all under-
takings nationalised by the Bandaranaike
governments. Ceylon probably cannot
“afford” its welfare state at present, but
can scarcely be criticised for wanting to
maintain it. Finally the rather minor
point of whether a “Trotskyist” is a
“Communist”. Dr Bares avoids the issue
that there is an official Communist Party
of Ceylon which got 2.5 per cent of the
vote. In Ceylon not even the hostile
Press refers to Dr Perera as a “Commu-
nist” but as a “Marxist”. Surely it is
better to adopt this reasonable local usage
than to employ a term which implies
adherence to views which Dr Perera has
specifically rejected.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

SHOWMEN
More impresarios than stars?
... LIVE ENTERTAINMENT.
are” the remark floated
up from one of several conversa-
tions with show business people
in the last few weeks “more impres-
arios here than stars.” A slight exaggera-
tion, of course (although less so if the
term is restricted to stars of long stand-
ing), but there’s no doubt that the entre-
preneur field is becoming rapidly over-
crowded in Australia. There are only a
handful of performers who —by some
special virtue of talents, personality, or
skill in Press relations can automati-
cally pack stadium, concert hall or night-
club, and of these by no means all are
within the reach of an Australian im-
presario. Elvis Presley has refused persis-
tently to come here, chiefly, it seems, be-
cause of a terror of flying (although his
schedule at Paramount, whisked from
one production to the next, could have
something to do with it as well). Lena
Horne, too, is afraid of planes. Bing
Crosby isn't interested in Australia. (The
disastrous Lee Gordon tour of his friend
Bob Hope may have put him off.) Mar-
lene Dietrich has not only priced her-
self out of the market so far, but has an
unnerving tendency to present prospec-
tive importers with multi-paged contracts
including a specified use of mirrors,
lights, and the busy use of a broom,
which must sweep every speck of dust
from a stage before she will set foot on
it. For the other Great Stars, the com-
petition is fierce and persistent. It’s no
longer true (hasn’t, in fact, been for
years) that only the has-beens come to
Australia: the country now offers money
as good as an entertainer can get any-
where. And the impresarios here are
prepared to offer contracts as satisfactory
as any in the world.
Harry Miller, Harry Wren, Kenn Brod-
ziak, Tibor Rudas, Eric Edgley, John
Carroll, John Haddad of Federal Hotels,
the other Harry Miller (of Stadiums
Ltd), the Sydney Chevron’s Frank
Christie, Lloyd Martin of the Tivoli
Theatre setup, J. C. Williamson’s, the
Wong Brothers (of Sydney’s Chequers
nightclub), Kym Bonython, John Collins
... the list of people in the business is
not a brief one. Investments are on a
staggering scale: it can cost as much as
between 10,000 and 70,000 dollars a
week to book a star act, plus air fares for
entourages of as many as nine (Patti
Page must have set the record at that
figure), which could bring the expenses
up to an additional 14,000 dollars or so,
while a band like the Scots Guards could
cost £40,000 in fares. The Beatles’ tour
under Brodziak is said to have set his
Aztec Services back at least £lOO,OOO
(but to have made, before tax, profits of
£250,000). If the initial outlay on these
tours is gigantic, the rewards, often, are
enough to keep an impresario in cham-
pagne for a very long time.
How do the impresarios go about
obtaining stars? Most deal direct with the
By CHARLES HIGHAM
big American agents: General Artists is
perhaps the most successful supplier to
Australia in this field. They extend an
invitation (after looking hard at record
sales here) to the agency, and the agency
approaches the artist, presumably
examining the field internationally to see
if anything better (or more close at
hand) is offering. If not or if there is
an hiatus between engagements the
agent will arrange the details, although
the terms of the contract are usually
laid down firmly by the Australian im-
porter. Sometimes the agency offers the
performers without a prior invitation.
An exception to this rule is the Chev-
ron Hotel operation in Sydney, a com-
plex deal involving three people: Frank
Christie, the hotel’s manager, Carlos
Gastel, an American impresario who
used to be Nat King Cole’s manager, and
Henry Miller, vice-president of General
Artists Corporation. The arrangement be-
gan in the early ’sixties when with in-
creasing competition from the clubs —the
hotel had to scrap its idea of combined
local acts and concentrate on importing
major stars. John Collins —an extra-


ordinarily energetic figure who has had
his finger in a dozen show business pies
and currently produces the Don Lane
“Tonight” show twice a week on tele-
vision as well as being involved in count-
less other ventures with the NLT outfit
in Sydney offered to go to America to
make the arrangements.
Collins, schooled at Riverview, worked
originally as a hardware salesman (“flog-
ging nails over the counter”), sold re-
frigerators and lawnmowers, worked as a
panelbeater and sheet metal worker,
made cardboard records of Johnny Dev-
lin and Ray Hoff, wrote a hit number
(“Turn the Lights Out, Johnny”) for
Devlin at the height of Devlin’s fame,
and, broke, went to work for Lee Gor-
don, ran the Ricky Nelson and Harry
Belafonte shows for him, produced “Juke
Box Jury” on TV and finally wound up
producing the Chevron floorshow.
“The shows lost £lOOO a week,”
Collins said. “They fired me one Satur-
day. Monday I went to them and sug-
gested I should go to America and hire
solo acts. I flew over at my own expense
and got an agreement with MCA that
they should supply us with stars. That
was in June, 1962.
“In July, Bobby Kennedy closed MCA.
I flew back to America but the deal fell
through again because the people never
delivered. Finally Yvonne de Carlo
agreed to come down, but she didn't
turn up for the meeting. I was desperate.
It was my last week at the Beverly Hilton
and I owed 732 dollars in bills. I had
150 dollars in my pocket and no fare
back.
“Then I met Carlos Gastel, the band-
leader Ina Hutton and Leonard Venner-
son, who had been Tommy Dorsey's
manager. Ina and Vennerson offered to
put up 2500 dollars for an act-importing
.deal and Gastel putting up an airline
credit card.
“I rang the hotel and asked them to
leave my luggage outside. I would pick
it up on my way to the airport and pay
the bill. Instead, I just picked up the
bags. I had 22 dollars in my pocket and it
took me eight of that to get to the airport.
“Later, Yvonne de Carlo came, and so
did Patrice Wymore. I got £75 a week
but my expenses were £75 a week as
well.” Leaving the hotel, Collins brought
out Peter, Paul and Mary on his own for
their brilliantly successful one-night stand
at the Stadium. He plans a tour of Joan
Baez and Bob Dylan later in the year.
The Chevron is currently supplied with
talent by Carlos Gastel's Australian As-
sociates in Los Angeles. Gastel pays the
air fares which he tries to offset by
booking the artists interstate and in the
Far East and the hotel provides the
accommodation, meals and orchestra.
Gastel gets £1 11s. 6d. of the £3 10s.
charged for seats in the Silver Spade and
the hotel gets £1 18s. 6d. The hotel
guarantees there will be 515 seats avail-
able to patrons, and occasionally meets
special requests for orchestral accompani-
ments, lighting, etc. “We didn't make a
buck on Ethel Merman” (who cost
10,000 dollars a week plus air fares),
Gastel told me on a recent visit to
Sydney. “But we believe this kind of
act is good for the hotel’s prestige
an act of goodwill on our part.” The
problem of choosing an act which will
“go” in Australia is a source of constant
tension to Gastel and Henry Miller of
General Artists, who was here with him
and supplies him with his acts. “You
ask me why I brought Wayne Newton?”
(An obscure singer who inexplicably hit
the jackpot at the Silver Spade.) “Well,
I tell you, we were stuck!” And the
grizzled, late-middle-aged Miller added:
“That’s the kind of gamble that explains
my hair. I'm really only twenty-four
years old.”
Did the stars ever give trouble? Christie
said: “No, the worst that can happen is
something easy, like Frank Sinatra asking
for blueberry muffins for breakfast. But
the managers they're the ones who

SIR FRANK TAIT
HARRY "STADIUM" MILLER
give the trouble. I remember John Rael,
who came with Patti Page. The lights
weren’t right, the chairs were the wrong
shape, everything in the room was wrong.
These hangers-on are in a very lucrative
position and try to make a lot of noise
to prove they’re indispensable.”
The Chevron arrangement is, as I have
said, unusual; John Haddad, of Federal
Hotels in Melbourne, deals direct with the
US agencies and Gastel is on his own
as an American impresario handling
talent in the country. From the begin-
ning, there have been striking personali-
ties involved in the field, but most —and
with the obvious exception of Lee Gor-
don have been Australians. One now
includes among these a New Australian,
Tibor Rudas, whose career is virtually
unique in that he exports Australian
talent —notably to Las Vegas and the
celebrated Lido in Paris.
A former member of a boys’ choir,
acrobatic dancer and dancing instructor,
Rudas exported his famous dancers from
here to the Far East before sending them
to America in 1958, the year he staged the
Oriental Cavalcade at the Tivoli. “1 had
to mortgage my home, my car, and my
wife's jewellery. It cost me £20,000 to
stage the show. It was a hit and so
were the Ziegfeld Follies. Then I decided
to stage ‘Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs’. I went to Hollywood to get
permission from Walt Disney's brother,
Roy.
“He said to me, ‘How many people are
there in Sydney?’ I said, ‘Two million.’
He said, ‘Get out’.” Later, Rudas returned
to Hollywood. Again he was rejected:
the population, Roy Disney again felt,
wasn't big enough to keep the show
going. The third visit, Rudas got a very
reluctant Disney to agree. “We paid Dis-
ney 250,000 dollars in royalties,” Rudas
said. “Not bad . . . Later I staged a
show in the Tropicana Hotel in Las
Vegas called ‘Pardon My French’. I even
filmed a segment of it at MGM myself,
although I'd never done anything like
that before. The segment involves an un-
usual technique in which live dance and
film are integrated in one.”
Harry Miller, no less daring, plans to
make a complete film here (with Mickey
Rooney) on a co-production deal with an
American company—“ Katie the Kanga-
roo”, a children’s story in color which he
believes will have international appeal.
Miller, whose dynamic personality has
considerably enlivened recent show busi-
ness history, made a small fortune on his
recent Rubenstein tour and intends to
continue his policy of importing “classi-
cal” performers. Errol Garner was on his
lists, and at time of writing he was due
to launch a folk festival; he believes that,
as in the US, a culture boom is here. He
admits he is playing a hunch with Gar-
ner: record sales do not necessarily indi-
cate popularity of a performer. “I have,
for instance, a partnership in a record
company in New Zealand. We might
sell 1000 albums of Sinatra and get a
good tour but then again we might sell
7000 albums of Dr Napoleon Hill’s
‘Think and Grow Rich’ but we would
scarcely sell tickets to his lectures at
4 guineas a head.” But Errol Garner
would appeal to what Mr Miller called
the “jazz core” of Australia.
How did Mr Miller go about promo-
ting concerts? “For classical concerts,
you would never use radio. Classical

No less successful than Miller is Kenn
(“Beatles”) Brodziak who has the genuine
look of a smaller, more engaging Alfred
Hitchcock. As early, as 1954 —in the
heyday of Lee Gordon—he brought
Gene Krupa here at 10,000 dollars a
week, then Ted Heath and his orchestra
(involving at least 23 air fares: “The big-
gest airlift up to that time in Australian
show business”), the band of the Irish
Guards (costing “£40,000 in fares alone”),
the Vienna Boys’ Choir, Winifred Atwell,
Dave Brubeck. Helen Shapiro. Cliff
Richard, George Shearing (who lost
money) and the band of the Scots
Guards. He hired the Beatles sight un-
seen in England before they were famous.
In 1950, a lawyer, an accountant, a
businessman and a society woman had
approached him and asked if they could
invest money in show business ventures
of this kind. They were still prosperously
involved in his Aztec Services even
though it sometimes costs as much as
10,000 dollars a day to bring in an
artist. “My annual turnover is—well —in
the half-million pounds category,” Mr
Brodziak beamed at me. “The Americans
come strictly for the money. The British
come for the sun.”
Mr Brodziak had a few things to say
about the impresario business. “The
agents play one impresario off against
another,” he said. “They tell each im-
presario he can have an entertainer ex-
clusively. When each impresario makes
a bid the agents say that another impre-
sario has bid higher. This gradually
forces prices up. Harry Miller, for in-
stance, has often been prepared to go
above the ceiling I set on payments. I
believe entertainers are only worth a
certain amount of money and no more.
Some of the bidding is ridiculous. Impre-
sarios have paid too much. They’ve gone
broke.” (Miller denied he was fighting
with other impresarios. “I plan to get in
a bit of gardening and ski-ing this year,”
he said. “I’ll be at home waxing my skis
while they’re fighting it out.”)
Another impresario who is—or says he
is—right outside the struggle for stars
that Brodziak mentioned, is Miller's
namesake: Harry Miller of Stadiums Ltd,
in partnership with Brodziak as Aztec-
Stadiums. The Stadium in Sydney got
under way as a place for entertainers in
the ’twenties, with vaudeville as well as
boxing and wrestling combined, rather
oddly, with afternoon teas “for the
ladies”. During the war, Miller saw
through United States Services shows,
and later Lee Gordon’s concerts (“Artie
Shaw’s was such a flop that if we hadn't
returned 60-70 per cent of the rental it
would have put Gordon out of busi-
ness”). Stadiums Ltd went into its own
impresario business importing Scottish
and Italian entertainers; from the
Beatles’ tour on they have been in part-
nership with Brodziak. Mr Miller denied
rumors that he and Brodziak were trying
to keep other managements out of the
Stadium (“We’re not a great bear, a
great, big, grizzly monster trying to crush
everyone in sight. Anyone can book the
Stadium who will meet our figure. Of
course, ours is a valuable property —two
acres of land and a million pounds worth
of building.”) And the acoustics? “The
best in Australia.” What about the com-
plaints of the artists? “Judy Garland
asked for rails on the steps to the stage,
white tape on every step, white tape
around the stage, a stationary stage...
Betty Hutton used language I won’t
repeat when she saw the Stadium for the
first time. Ella Fitzgerald wanted black
drapes around the stage. The sound
system went off for Sarah Vaughan be-
cause the ABC used it to record the
show. Sometimes the revolving stage
doesn't revolve. But I don’t think we’re
any worse than the Cow Palace.”
Kym Bonython is something of a
maverick in the business: as a small
cluster of small-time impresarios inclu-
ding the group that brought Odetta, art
collector and racing driver, son of a
wealthy South Australian family, he
imported Ray Charles, Dave Brubeck
and Thelonius Monk and is involved
financially in Brodziak's outfit (“Eddie
Condon and the All Stars cost £9500 in
air fares alone. I lost money”.) And he
is said to have lost, too, on his recent
Thelonius Monk tour, which clashed,
ironically, with the tour of Brubeck run
by Brodziak.
Rocky passage
Tn “legitimate” theatres, impresarios
have had an equally rocky passage: the
signs point to a gradual deterioration of
audiences for “big” musicals. Theatres
in Melbourne and Sydney have gone dark
for periods, chiefly due to the short-
age of “sure-fire” commercial successes.
Lloyd Martin of the Tivoli —a cold-eyed
dynamo who flies internationally to sign
up new stars —lost what is reported to
be as much as £20,000 (some say more)
on the recent Sydney season of “Fade
Out, Fade In”, and, as he says, “a show
has to run a year or more in Australia
to make a profit”. One of the problems
is casting: “Australians won’t accept any
Australian as a star, except June Bron-
hill.” (He was referring, of course, only
to musical shows.) “That’s a pity. For •
instance, we made a terrible mistake with
‘Stop the World, I Want to Get Off’.
The overseas star, Jackie Warner, lost
his voice on opening night. The ideal
person for the lead would have been
Reg Livermore but whether they would
have accepted an Australian or not is a
matter of doubt.”
John Carroll, of the Garnet Carroll
organisation, is faced with similar pro-
blems. (And so are Sir Frank Tait of
J. C. Williamson’s, a charming octoge-
narian who once brought Melba and
Chaliapin to Australia, and his partners.)
On April 24, when “High Spirits” closed
at Carroll's Melbourne Princess, the
theatre shut down “indefinitely”. Costs
have soared: ten years ago Carroll’s
father Garnet staged “Kismet” with a
cast of 60, at £23,000; today, a similar
production would cost between £70,000
and £80,000, while theatre tickets have
remained at much the same price.

Salaries, too, have doubled. There was
no “sure-fire” success, John Carroll said,
but if a show had become famous as a
film or through some hit numbers, it
stood a chance. “Eighty per cent of pro-
ductions tried out for Broadway fail
here. The competition for the few
Broadway hits forces up their price, and
increases the impresario’s perennial head-
ache.”
Eric Edgley, who has concentrated
largely in recent years on Russian enter-
tainers, climaxing his achievement with
his highly successful importing of the
Moscow Circus, is more optimistic—he
believes that Russia still provides the
kind of “living” entertainment Austra-
lians want. (Just as well: the effort of
bringing the circus here hospitalised
Edgley and his son.) If Edgley is well
enough he will set out later this year to
arrange a tour of the stars of the
Russian Ballet; then the Black Sea Naval
Ensemble (a group rather like the Red
Army Choir). So far, his Russian ven-
tures had proved a marked success.
Harry Wren, too, has tended to stay
away from strictly “legitimate” theatre,
and with equally good results. He
resembles Tibor Rudas in his concentra-
tion on leggy shows that emphasise
humor and sex. Son of a sea captain, he
projected with and sold talkie equipment
in the ’thirties, then joined J. C. William-
son’s as an equal partner, operating the
Theatre Royal in Adelaide and buying
the Majestic privately, which he still owns.
His latest venture, the “Tokyo Nights”
review, cost £82,000 to stage; by the time
the tour is over, he will have laid out
more than £150,000. The air fares from
Tokyo cost £4OO for each of the 73
members of the company. But if, as was
recently estimated, the Adelaide and Mel-
bourne tours paid for the costs of the
tour, the rest would be sheer profit.
Wren put his finger on one reason for
the problems the “legit.” impresarios
were having: “In the bulk of theatres in
Australian cities we ask people to come
in, sit down in a number of rows and act
like regimented animals. Get up to let
someone pass, you can’t smoke, you,
can’t drink . . .”
But Wren’s isn’t, of course, the whole
answer. The fact is that with the jet age
Australians want —and can now get—the
biggest solo performers in sophisticated
and comfortable hotels; or spectacular
national shows from Russia or Japan
which would grace any stage in the
world. Most Broadway shows —and even
Broadway hits are utterly sterile and
empty these days—can’t compete (always
excepting special items like “My Fair
Lady” and “Hello, Dolly”), in a popula-
tion as small as this one, with the huge
dance shows, with the big solo acts
like Peter, Paul and Mary, Harry Bela-
fonte, Sammy Davis, Ethel Merman, the
Beatles, the Vienna Boys’ Choir. It’s sig-
nificant that, while Harry Miller polishes
his water-skis and thinks about his next
classical music tour, Kenn Brodziak pre-
pares for the Beatles’ forthcoming visit.
John Collins negotiates for Baez and
Dylan, and Carlos Gastel and General
Artists’ Henry Miller run down the
dwindling list of possible stars who
haven't visited the Chevron lately, John
Carroll and his “legit.” theatrical col-
leagues and competitors are having to
worry a little more about the way things
are going. If the legitimate stage is more
ailing than ever, the trade in stars is
booming to an unprecedented degree.
There’s no question in which direction—•
despite the overcrowding of the field
any new man with money, ambition, and
a contact with the American agencies,
would go.
THEATRE
Not for Aunt Edna
You’ll Come To Love Your Sperm Test.
John Antrobus. Emerald Hill Theatre,
Melbourne.
With some shows it helps to take a
stiff whisky afterwards. Watch this one;
it should be taken before. A slightly
alcoholic mood will make it go down
all the better. Bring your flask, but
leave your aunt at home.
This little frolic seems to have led
some English critics to indulge in pro-
phecies. Penelope Gilliat saw it as “a
gigantic lunge in the right direction”,
and Charles Marowitz as “a loping,
somewhat unsteady stride in the direc-
tion of the future”. I don’t know about
that, and I’m sure the thought would
appal Mr Antrobus. “You'll Come To
Love Your Sperm Test” does not point
in any direction. It is simply the best
night of sick humor we have yet had on
stage. It’s a goonish entertainment with
a dash of theatre of the absurd, but
to read more into it than that qualifies
you for a gag in the show.
There’s no question that it is funny.
If it did not sound pompous one might
say it is also healthy. It is so gustily
and unashamedly “dirty” as to be almost
clean: “My husband can’t have inter-
course. He’s afraid of heights.”-—“He
should wear a parachute.”—“He can’t,
he’s a Catholic.” Or: “Greater love
has no man than to lay down his wife
for a set of plastic spoons.” There’s a
Vicar who doesn’t dig funerals and who
asks, “Did you like your wafer today?”
There is an aborted child who converses
with his sperm-tested Daddy, and a
Queen giving a Christmas broadcast to
the Commonwealth from which I am
sorry to be unable to quote. In sum,
two hours of well-sustained irreverence
and spoofery.
The thing differs from the usual hil-
arity binge mainly in its physical trap-
pings. The joke is always a visual joke;
in my view Antrobus has learned more
from the circus—which has always been
“in the round” —than from the theatre.
He has tables that grow udders and a
doctor (more or less the central char-
acter) who makes some very jolly passes
with one of those instruments used for
flitting flies. There is something beauti-
fully clownish about the way the four
participants behave and move, and for
which the television screen would not
allow enough scope. If we must be

serious about trifles let us say this piece
marks, if anything, a return to one of the
oldest and best-tried techniques of all,
brought up-to-date by its zany subject-
matter. Inasmuch as all satire tilts at
conditions and attitudes clothed in an
aura of respectability, this one, too, may
somew'here have a critical purpose. So
what?
Everything here becomes totally re-
versed and inverted: religion, art, sex
and patriotism. Sound effects are used
galore, knockabout is unrestrained and
the stage shakes and trembles. Some
of it we have seen before but the mix-
ture as a whole is explosively fresh.
George Whaley obviously had a wonder-
ful time producing it. and Gerda Nicol-
son, John Derum. John Paton and, above
all, Michael Boddy give it all they have.
Laughs, somew'hat hesitant at the start,
eventually come thick and fast.

Outside Morality
The Country Wife. William Wycherley. Old
Tote Theatre. Sydney.
The Poker Session. Hugh Leonard. Indepen-
dent Theatre.
Robin Lovejoy in his programme note
raises the question whether “The Country
Wife” is an immoral or an amoral play.
Neither, it seems to me, but a moral one.
This is the kind of question about
Restoration comedy that has agitated
critics for centuries. The 18th century
found Wycherley too coarse and Garrick
produced a genteel version, renamed
“The Country Girl”. In the early 19th
century Lamb decided that Restoration
comedy was outside morality altogether,
had no connection with real life and
therefore could be enjoyed with a clear
conscience. Later in the 19th century
Macaulev, w'hile admitting that Restor-
ation comedy w'as entertaining, describ-
ed it as “a disgrace to our language and
our national character”.
“The Country Wife” is, surely, satiric
comedy which criticises manners and
morals by exposing them in a wittily
exaggerated fashion. The society which
is depicted in “The Country Wife” was
certainly not puritan, but neither was
Wycherley. Hypocrisy and folly were
his targets rather than immorality in a
narrow sense.
In showing the remarkable success of
Horner’s stratagem to gain access to
respectable ladies by pretending to be a
eunuch, Wycherley is concerned chiefly
to expose the hypocrisy of these women.
For all their talk of “honor” they have
not the slightest interest in obeying the
rules, but only in not being found out.
Bright-eyed, and speaking wdth a soft
country burr, Patricia Conollv portrays
most delightfully Margery Pinchwife’s
country frankness which makes her such
DINAH SHEARING, JOHN TREVOR and ROGER
CLIMPSON in Robin Lovejoy's production of "The
Country Wife", at Sydney's Old Tote Theatre.
an attractive character amid the coldness
and deceptions of the city.
Robin Lovejoy’s production has both
polish and gusto. It is a great pleasure to
see a fully professional production of a
classical play which has not had to be
skimped in the cast or the trappings. Ron
Reid's settings and colorful costumes are
charming and the changes are deftly
managed.
Roger Climpson’s urbane and genial
Horner effortlessly sets the tone of good-
humored bawdy. Alexander Hay’s Spar-
kish is a somewhat undisciplined but ef-
fectively theatrical performance which
enlivens the stage whenever he appears.
Ron Haddrick’s clumping Pinchwife,
with his ill-fitting clothes, smudged face
and bumpkin suspiciousness, is like a
peasant caricature of Othello and the
actor obviously enjoyed playing him as
such.
“The Poker Session” is an odd mixture
of realism, comedy and thriller. The
comedy is by far the best ingredient and
the first two acts are very funny. But the
third act runs down as it approaches the
contrived and rather macabre ending.
The dramatist’s recommendation to
transfer his Irish play to a local setting,
which Peter Summerton adopted, does
not really work. Kevin, the opportunist
brother (played with the right bullying
brashness by Terry Reynolds-Gill) and
his wife Fran (whom Andonia Katsaros
plays with a delightful mixture of down-
rightness and explosive giggles) seem very
much at home in a Sydney suburb. But
the two madmen have too much Irish wit
to come out of Gladesville. John Arm-
strong does a good portrait of the sensi-
tive Billy and A 1 Thomas is wonderful
as the irrepressible Teddy.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
MUSIC
Mozart and Mahler
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Town Hall,
Sydney.
Visiting ABC “celebrity” Gyorgy Pauk,
a young expatriate Hungarian violinist,
was introduced to Sydney audiences in
Mozart's last, the A major, concerto.
Pauk has a fine tone and sound technique,
though his style of playing is a little im-
personal and possibly better suited to
the Bartok concerto he is to play later on.
The lovely Mozart work calls for crisp-
ness and, at times, meticulous staccato.
It was played rather bloodlessly, Dean
Dixon tending to set tempi slower than
usual and the soloist sounding a trifle
veiled: the violin tone, most of the time,
was sweet and agreeable, but the odd
sour note could not be overlooked.
Measured against the concerto's known
potential, this was a little disappointing;
the reason may well have been the con-
ductor’s and orchestra’s preoccupation
with the gigantic task to follow: Mahler’s
Seventh Symphony. Written in 1904-5,
this work is said to have been program-
med by Goossens about 1951—1 have no
recollection of the occasion. As a Mahler
fan, I was very keen to hear it played and
neither the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
nor their conductor was a disappoint-
ment. Dixon was indeed alive to every
felicity in the score, proved himself a
capable Mahler conductor (not every fine
conductor is!) and clearly regarded the
work as a fit occasion for putting the
orchestra through their paces. He showed
quite clearly what improvements he had
wrought here: Mahler's fiendish score in-
cludes solo passages for just about every
instrument and, overall, every section of
the orchestra did well enough to prove
that they are now worthy of being sent
abroad as a musical exhibit.
But, to be honest (can a Mahler fan?),
one cannot simply describe this sym-
phony as “fine music”. The three middle
movements —the two Nightmusic ones
and the shadowy scherzo that connects
them are fine indeed and on a par
with Mahler’s best creations.
The symphony is “conductors’ music”
par excellence. Dean Dixon is to be con-
gratulated on the standard the orchestra’s
playing has now attained and on his faith
in their proficiency. As far as the sym-
phony is concerned. I'll be satisfied to
wait another fifteen years before it is
again programmed!

RECORDINGS
Informal “Blow”
Monk. The Thelonious Monk Quartet. CBS.
Stereo 58P233193.
A Song Will Rise. Peter, Paul and Mary.
Warner Bros. Stereo W 51589.
The publicity given to Thelonious
Monk’s eccentricities is, doubtless, partly
responsible for his considerable, if be-
lated, success; but his nonconformity is
due, I believe, to unusual personal and
artistic integrity rather than any desire
to be different. Recognition has not
altered the pungent force of his playing.
Its rich content compared with that of
other modern pianists is due, not only
to extraordinary creative powers, but to
the fact that his roots are deep in jazz
tradition; he does not reject musical ideas
because they happen to be unfashionable.
“Monk”, like all his recordings, has
the workshop atmosphere of the informal
“blowing” session where risks are taken
and anything is likely to happen. The-
lonious himself frequently sounds as if he
were exploring the possibilities of the
tunes prior to including them in his
repertoire. This is particularly so on
“Just One Way to Say I Love You” and
“April in Paris”, on which the thought-
ful, searching piano solos are occasion-
ally embellished with perfectly timed and
executed Tatum-like runs, as if to say:
“I can do that stuff if I want to, but
listen to these crazy chords I am digging
out here. This is what I mean!” When
playing the works of other composers,
Monk’s method is to strip the tune to
its bones, then remodel the flesh from
his own fertile imagination. In this way,
Gershwin's “Liza” is practically turned
inside-out, while the children’s song,
“That Old Man"’, virtually becomes a
Monk composition, after Rouse’s dead-
pan statement of the melody.
While paying little attention to the
accusations of commercialism which the
“authentic” folk enthusiasts direct
against Peter, Paul and Mary, I find
much of “A Song Will Rise” too sugary
for my taste and. although the teamwork
is faultless, the harmony, at times, has
a “singing-commercial” slickness which
comes close to destroying the character
of some of the material. But, on the
whole, they make a pleasant noise and,
when all three are in full voice on such
numbers as “Wasn’t That a Time” and
Bob Dylan’s “When the Ship Comes In”,
they achieve a moody fervor that is more
convincing than most current folk-
singers. The' jazzy “San Francisco Bay
Blues”, “For Lovin’ Me” and Paul’s
“Talkin’ Candy Bar Blues” do much to
counteract the dreariness of such dirges
as “Jimmy Whalen”, “Gilgarry Moun-
tain” and “Ballad of Spring Hill”. The
sleeve-notes constitute the greatest con-
glomeration of nonsense I have ever read.

Koch and Shakespeare
By PETER SHRUBB
Across the Sea Wall. Christopher Koch.
Heinemann. 275. 6d.
In his second novel Christopher Koch
has set himself the extremely difficult
task of making something artistically
valuable out of a story told by a fairly
uninteresting and unimportant hero. The
difficulties are immense, and stem not, of
course, from the fact that the hero is a
very limited and undeveloped young man
—sub specie aeternitatis we are all pretty
certainly limited and undeveloped, and
even young, but nevertheless see our-
selves reflected or touched on in great
works of art with the most killing and
inspiriting accuracy but from the fact
that this hero tells his own story.
One or more of three things can hap-
pen under such circumstances; the hero
can simply be himself, and bore us
rather; or he can both be himself and
reveal himself, and perhaps interest us
rather; or he can grow and change in the
course of his narrative, and perhaps
interest us even more. The third pos-
sibility is the most interesting, because
what seems finally to matter most in a
work of art is the quality of the insight
and understanding the whole work em-
bodies, and not its surface excitements, its
noises and colors; the third possibility is
the one that seems to give most room to
the workings of a developed intelligence.
But the difficulties it poses are enormous,
and I don’t think Mr Koch quite sur-
mounts them.
Robert O'Brien is a sort of latter-day
Gatsby, a hero who finds the word
“dream” frequently at the end of his pen,
and whose principal claim to adulthood is
nostalgia.
And l know now, at twenty-five, that
all our notions, all our ideas, our poli-
tics, our solemn chatter, our plans, our
successes all the paraphernalia of
adulthood, which I am just putting on
are nothing, nothing compared with
that one possessed moment of first
youth, when the soul is like a tunnel
through which a huge wind tears; and
young, alone, encircled by darkness, on
the move, faces purged of all expres-
sions but wonder (the only faces fit to
stare into the night!) we watch the
ports of departure recede, and the fly-
ing lights of ships in the roadstead:
metal monsters which carry in secret
cells the tender flesh of our dreams;
machines which open the world!
Nothing matters beside that moment:
those for whom it never existed chatter
politics or art or business to fill the gap;
those for whom it did, do the same
to try to forget.
This kind of thing, it seems to me,
accurately embodies the easy attitudinis-
ing of the romantic young adult. It is
littered with the gross hyperbole, the rhet-
orical accumulations, the ecstatic repeti-
tions, the big basic words, the images of
dark and light and storm and calm, the
exclamations, the logic of metaphor, the
contrast of enormous with trivial lit-
tered with the “devices” of, say, the
speech Macbeth makes when he hears of
the death of his. wife. Two important
differences are that Macbeth has lived
what he says in that speech whereas
CHRISTOPHER KOCH
Robert O’Brien knows nothing of adult-
hood, and that Macbeth is in an impor-
tant way right whereas Robert O’Brien
is in an important way wrong, for there
is much in life in my view, anyway
that matters a great deal more than the
moment he describes, important though
that moment may for a time seem to be;
it is this ignorance and error that make
Robert O’Brien’s claims egotistical
romanticising. Only words that have had
the wind blown out of them by experi-
ence can begin to be beautiful.
Mr Koch’s hero has, nevertheless, lived
through something. He has failed first
year university before the book starts; he
has fiddled around as a resentful clerk
in the Public Service for a few years; he
has fallen in love and then gradually
come to feel stifled by a pretty North
Shore university student called Christine.
Two months before he is due to marry
poor Christine, Robert O’Brien sails for
Europe with a kind of gigolo/actor called
Jimmy. He is unhappy at having merely
sent Christine a letter the moment before
he leaves Sydney, but very excited at the
ship, the darkness of sea nights, and so
on.
The half-moon of deck was empty,
open all around to the stiff, spume-
moist breeze, which whipped my facei
there was a muffled thundering, like a
waterfall. My eyes watered; l wiped a
running nose; I had never been so elec-
tric with life as at that moment.
The detail of the running nose has
the effect, it seems to me, of showing up
the quality of Robert O’Brien’s “life”
not, of course, because noses do not run
at really important moments, but because
the sentence gives the running nose a
disproportionate importance. This kind of
limiting of the hero’s claims, however,
is rather rare in the book.
On the ship, as one might have ex-
pected, he falls heavily for an earth-
mother type woman this one is
actually lactating and spends the night
ashore with her in Djakarta. The rest of
the book is the story of their wanderings,
for they leave the ship in Colombo and
travel to Madras with an Indian pas-
senger who has taken up with the
earth-mother’s girl friend. It turns out,
incidentally, that both these women are
strip-tease dancers.
Christopher Koch is a poet, and it is
therefore not surprising that Robert
O’Brien probably writes best when he is
describing what things and places look
like; on such fairly neutral territory,
O’Brien and his creator can nearly work
as a team, and the pictures of Indian
beggars, Indian streets, Indian mountains
and plains stand out in one’s memory.
These evocations of appearance, that is,
work to support the novel in several
ways, and here that attraction towards
the extreme, the excessive, is a kind of
strength; Indian faces and places are
vividly particularised.
But these are not, of course, the real
subject of the book, and not the real
subject of its hero’s interest. His real
interest is in his spiritual adventures and
explorations, and an attraction towards
the excessive, here, is limiting and obscur-
ing; it is not enlightening, really, at a
climactic moment to hear Robert O’Brien
reflect, “I’ve never much liked reality”
what on earth does he mean? About
other people, what he means is often very
clear; he sees that Carleen, for instance,
one of the stripteasers, is a “slut”; it is
no great insight, but it is not abuse, it is
judgment. His own character and ex-
perience, however, Robert O’Brien seems
unable to judge and make a mature
evaluation of, even at the end of the
book; to the end, he seems unable to
awake from his “dream”. He has the right
to sleep, of course, and to dream; but the
extent to which his dreams dominate and
give their tone to the novel is the extent
to which it is debilitated.

Mr Wilson’s War
The Making of a Prime Minister. Anthony
Howard and Richard West. Jonathan
Cape. 425. 6d.
On January 18, 1963, Hugh Gaitskell
died after a short illness. Five months
later the Profumo scandal, coming after
a series of other blows, finished the
political career of the once unflappable
Macmillan. Both parties faced crises of
leadership. This book is about how
these crises were resolved and how the
new leaders conducted themselves in
the election campaign of the following
year.
It is not a bad book not, at least,
if one rates readability highly but it
is badly named. The title invites com-
parison with Theodore White’s “The
Making of the President”, but, in
charity, the invitation should be refused.
It is not half the book that White’s was.
It lacks the latter’s panoramic qualities,
its ability to make concrete detail and
anecdote bear general significance, its
sure grasp of the way in which the
various parts of a system interact on
each other. Much of it fails to rise
above the level of sophisticated, “inside”
gossip found in the London weeklies and
some of it sinks well below that. While
the addict will be fascinated to learn
that Mr Wilson pours HP sauce over
his food, that Sir Alec likes to do a bit
of flower arranging at times of stress
(a piece of information thoughtfully
volunteered by R. A. Butler) and that
Jo Grimond ate a green-iced cake on
election night, one does feel after a
while that enough is enough.
It is difficult to say how accurate the
accounts of the two succession struggles
are. As Richard Crossman (himself
Wilson’s campaign manager against
Brown) wrote a couple of years ago,
under modern conditions the real
struggle for power is “driven under-
ground by the requirements of party
discipline (and) is normally a conspira-
torial matter of cliques and cabals”.
The elector “can only hear the garbled
versions leaked to the Press by in-
terested parties”. The accounts given in
this book are certainly more coherent
than those which appeared at the time
but whether they are more accurate is
another matter. At least one contender
for the Conservative leadership, Quintin
Hogg, has claimed that the account given
here is a travesty of the truth. One does
feel that the authors are probably better
connected on the Labor side than on
the Conservative, and that their account
of that struggle (which in any case was
more open) is the more reliable one.
In these accounts the heavy stress
laid on personalities and on tactical
manoeuvres may be justified. They were,
after all, struggles within the Parlia-
mentary parties and the relationships
between a few dozen men who knew
each other well were decisive. But
when the same treatment is extended to
the general election which followed,
the result is unsatisfactory. While the
current tendency to speak of a shift to-
wards “Prime Ministerial Government”
or a “Presidential System” in British
politics may have some justification, it
does not follow that it makes sense to
see a general election as simply as
gladiatorial contest between two leaders.
The average elector, after all, is hardly
likely to have caught up with the most
recent theories of the intellectuals and
may still proceed according to old
myths and beliefs. Certainly results, like
that at Smethwick, suggest that local
issues and the impact which individual
candidates are capable of making are
still important factors in determining
results.
In fact, the story which this book tells
seems to work against the assumption
which apparently lies behind it the
assumption, that is, that the personalities
and activities of the two leaders are the
crucial factors in elections. For if the
Labor Party started off with such a long
lead (and all the opinion polls agreed
that they did), and if Wilson was such
a superior performer to Home (and the
book has no doubts at all about this,
Home being presented as an utter in-
competent), then why did the Labor
Party only win by an eyelash? The
book does not answer this and, given its
assumptions, it is difficult to see how
it could. It is difficult to see how the
authors could avoid conceding that
nearly any other Conservative leader
must have defeated Wilson.
It is probably better not to ask these
questions but merely to enjoy the book
as a chatty account of what some British
politicians were doing last autumn. The
figure drawn most fully and sympa-
thetically is Harold Wilson. He emerges
as a more complicated and highly strung
person than one expected and in reply
to the rather unkind question asked by
one Tory politician “If you were buy-
ing a second-hand car, would you buy
it from Harold Wilson?'’ one is moved
to answer a tentative “yes”.
OWEN HARRIES
After the Party
Conferring again with the lady Alcohol
I turn to the blue morning with bruised
eyes—
Eggs that were poached in ink—and
shudder
Against the roughness of light on the
tongue.
What was it I said, or anyone, last night,
That caused the good dame to treat me
in this way?
Or was it to her sister, Nicotine,
1 gave offence, who stirred the liver
flukes
To float on vision like a scum of spiders?
A fly stamps over the ceiling in great
boots,
And hurriedly I seek amends and pour
Hopeful libations in a toast of aspirin.

Sad, Sad, Sad
Visions of Gerard. Tristessa. Jack Kerouac.
Andre Deutsch. 235.
Kerouac is like a record which some-
body has forgotten to switch off. The
sound drones on, snatches continue to
flow into our ear. Kissable milk light . . .
Tathagata . . . hands V-claspecl in eternal
ecstasy of Nirvana . . . sad, sad, sad.
Especially sad, for that's where the
needle got stuck.
Predictable, perhaps, but a shame for
all that, because there used to be two
Kerouacs. There was the Dharma bum
with the bleeding heart and the gift of
words, and the free-wheeling American
with the wind in his hair, a feminised
Walt Whitman. That one is gone, for
good it seems, and only the haemophiliac
remains. But one is nothing without the
other. Or, rather, left over, is just
Kerouac, the man who only sees only
feels himself.
Even when he w'rites about his brother.
“Visions of Gerard”, the first of the two
stories in this volume, is the tale of a
child who died young, a holy sufferer. The
one thing it has not is spiritual muscle,
though of course there are still a few
cartilages here and there. The intimate
French Canadian w'orld transplanted to
Massachusetts forces its w'ay through in
spite of Kerouac's best endeavor to
smother it with Gefuehl. A street may
come to life, the w'ay a man speaks (his
father), and a clannish sense of Catholic
solidarity. This is his home-pitch, and
one can only hope that he will do some-
thing with it before it is quite too late.
"Tristessa” takes us back to Mexico,
if nothing like as evocatively as the earlier
books. Tristessa, who is a dear junky
dying in the slums, is loved, too late, by
the American sailor wdth the Bodhisatva
urge. It's a claustrophobic piece not with-
out incidental beauty but as empty of
novelty as the inside of a bikkhus valet-
pouch.
Alas, that Buddhism can be so com-
pletely misunderstood! It is not a therapy
of dripping baroque.
DAVID MARTIN
The Best General
Reminiscences. Douglas MacArthur. Heine-
mann. 85s.
We must surely be able to learn some-
thing about modern times from the fact
that, when the Republican Party came to
select a General as its Presidential can-
didate in 1952, it chose Eisenhower, and
not MacArthur. For MacArthur was
the superior in every one of those
soldierly qualities which the Republicans
profess to hold‘so dear. In the field, he
showed superb physical courage. As a
leader, he inspired great respect (and
often adulation) among those he led. As
a strategist, he was original, daring, and,
most important of all, usually successful.
He was, in short, a model of what the
West Point man should be. And yet it
is, perhaps, because of this very excel-
lence in martial matters that he missed
the Presidency. As Franklin Roosevelt
once said to him, “Douglas, I think you
are our best general, but I believe you
would be our worst politician.”
For Eisenhower did have one edge
over MacArthur—he possessed the asset,
indispensable in modern democratic poli-
tics, of apparent humility (and he has,
admittedly, had much to be humble
about). MacArthur, on the other hand,
was never one to underestimate his own
qualities. Thus, even when he attempted
to don the mask.of modesty, it always
proved to be a patently false one. In the
“Reminiscences”, he attempts to con-
vey an impression of judicious self-
evaluation by quoting the opinions of
others, and then demurring at the wilder
flight of hyperbole (which he nevertheless
inevitably found “deeply moving”.). For
example, when he reports on the 1962
Congressional resolution of thanks to
him for his services, he quotes at length
from such admirers as Congressman
Dorn—“Douglas MacArthur is one of
the greatest military captains of all his-
tory”—and Lyndon Johnson —“a career
never equalled in American military
annals, a towering intellect, right in his
decisions” —only to finish with his own
humble estimation that Congress “had
rendered an opinion of my services that
I felt did me too much honor''. The
patient reader will discover for himself
that this is by no means an isolated
example . . .
However, one must stress that the
reader of this book needs extreme
patience for, if he wishes to receive any
illumination about the great political
issues in which MacArthur figured, he
will be disappointed. Thus, even though
MacArthur himself was apparently not
consulted about the decision to drop the
atomic bombs on Japan, he must surely
have been in a position to provide in this
book a first rate evaluation of the politi-
cal and military situation in Asia at the
time, in the light of which we could
have been able to judge anew the reasons
which Truman has given for deciding to
drop the bombs.
Again, one cannot but be deeply dis-
appointed with MacArthur's account of
his pro-Consulship in Japan in the imme-
diate post-war years. For the most part,
the description operates on the following
level: “. . . years of overseas duty had
schooled me well in the lessons of the
Orient and, what was probably more im-
portant, had taught the Far East that I
was its friend.”
Therefore, the reader must plough
along, waiting for snippets, such as Tru-
man's rather accurate forecast of what
an Eisenhower administration would be
like: “Eisenhower doesn't know the first
thing about politics. Why, if he should
become President, his administration
would make Grant's look like a model of
perfection.”
As a whole, MacArthur's work suffers
from a lack of overall structure the
“towering intellect” which Lyndon John-
son discerned is not much in evidence
here. And yet MacArthur obviously
possessed a superior intelligence which,
even though it was harnessed to rather
narrowly military concerns and thus
lacked the breadth of interest character-
istic of a de Gaulle, was nevertheless
rare enough among generals. And for
this we in Australia may be thankful, for
in the dark days of 1942 we sorely
needed a superior military intelligence.
Nor is MacArthur now a figure of
solely historical interest, for his strategy,
frustrated in Korea, may now be finding
its realisation in Vietnam. It was Lyn-
don Johnson, after all, who stated, just
three years ago that MacArthur was
“right in his decisions”.

The Fiedler Doctrine
Waiting for the End. Leslie A. Fiedler.
Cape. 51s.
Professor Fiedler’s sub-title, “The Ameri-
can Literary Scene from Hemingway to
Baldwin”, prompts the unworthy com-
ment that he might have cast his net
wider than he has. Two of the liveliest
talents in the United States are Edward
Albee and John Rechy. Rechy gets
merely a footnote. Albee is one of the
names on the impressive list printed on
the dust-jacket, but isn’t mentioned in
the text at all.
Never mind. “Love and Death in the
American Novel” ought to have prepared
us for Professor Fiedler’s very personal
selectivity and deeply subjective judg-
ments, and there is still a great deal of
pleasure to be got from “Waiting for
the End”. There is, of course, as his
very last sentence admits to us, no end.
But there is some kind of beginning to
contemporary American writing, and it’s
probably to be found in the work of the
recently deceased grand old men, Hem-
ingway and Faulkner. It may neverthe-
less be seen, in the long run, that neither
man created a viable tradition. Perhaps
this ought to be pointed out quickly to
Norman Mailer. If Hemingway was
really the poor man’s Fitzgerald, then
Mailer is the destitute’s Hemingway. He
is praised by Professor Fiedler for the
vigor of his language, which is almost
like commending William Burroughs for
the clarity and lucidity of his thought.
Burroughs, whose language has a vigor-
ous beauty if little else, is, however,
bunched together with Ginsberg and the
tedious old Beats.
I mentioned Rechy and Albee. But
Rechy has produced nothing after “City
of Night”, and Albee, having written
two-thirds of a brilliant play in “Who’s
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, is currently
represented on Broadway by a piece of
work which sounds embarrassingly and
emptily pretentious. Playwrights (though
why?) are apparently really outside Pro-
fessor Fiedler’s scope in this survey.
There are, it is true, two or three fleet-
ing references to Arthur Miller, though
the only work of his actually to be con-
sidered is his script for the film “The
Misfits”. Poor Tennessee Williams is no
longer intellectually respectable: he
makes a one-line appearance classified as
the last of the “Homosexual Decadents”.
Are there American novelists now
writing, of the calibre of Fitzgerald or
Nathanael West? Professor Fiedler in-
cludes Nabokov as an American. Fair
enough, but I think it has to be admitted
that he comes from that obscure Ameri-
can state which also produced the Ameri-
can philosopher Einstein, the American
composer Schonberg, the American
musicians Lotte Lehmann and Bruno
Walter, and the greatest American nove-
list of all, Thomas Mann.
Henry Miller is a more admissible
name. But, in several pages devoted to
a consideration of him, there is no men-
tion of his finest achievement, “The
Colossus of Maroussi”. Professor Fied-
ler’s concern is with that aspect of Miller
which adumbrates the mood and man-
ner of the Beats. He writes about the
Beat novelists and poets as though they
still existed as a clearly definable group.
Their traditional home, San Francisco,
hasn’t seen them for several years, and
it is doubtful whether there was ever any-
thing to be gained by arbitrarily lumping
together such disparate talents as Ferlin-
ghetti, Ginsberg, Kerouac, Corso and
Burroughs.
Baldwin? It's too easy to feel, reading
his novels, that he's really an essayist.
He writes a prose compounded of quick
intelligence and deep feeling. As a
novelist, he appears to be going the usual
inflated way. (“Another Country” is
already bought for filming.) He has, of
course, other things on his mind, and it
is rather too early to know whether his
present understandable preoccupation
with social injustice in his own country
will have a permanently detrimental
effect on his work. Obviously, he does
not see the problem in these terms. He
is a missionary. He has begun to write
plays (“Blues for Mister Charlie” and
“The Amen Corner” will both be touring
Europe this year), and, since the theatre
has a more direct line to the outside
world than the novel has, it may be that
this is where Baldwin will properly find
himself. If so, he will need to learn to
distinguish legitimate political theatre
from illegitimate theatrical politics.
It is the reader with a few opinions of
his own who will gain most from “Wait-
ing for the End”: its author is a lively
but occasionally erratic guide. He has
his insights, of course, as when he says
of Hemingway, “He was, of all eminent
writers, the most nearly inarticulate.”
And he is never dull. On the other
hand, he does try occasionally to blud-
geon you into believing him.

Well now that it is over
I remember my homeland the mountains

And hands hands deaf as starfish fetching
The bread still frozen
To the tables.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Monopolist Commission
TTave you been to the Tribunal lately?
This may be a popular greeting
among businessmen when the Trade
Practices legislation comes into opera-
tion, because it seems that the Tribunal
will bear much of the responsibility for
deciding what is a restrictive trade agree-
ment.
Perhaps, as a consequence, there may
be more of a spirit of bonhomie and
trustworthiness in business life, because
it would be preferable to seek a gentle-
man's agreement or put up with honest
competition than to commit an agree-
ment to writing.
Even so, there is a broad list of agree-
ments and practices which must be
registered as examinable. Consumer
organisations complain that no direct
restraints are placed on resale price
maintenance. But a start has been made,
even if the machinery is criticised as too
conciliatory and too secret. At least it
should be given a chance to work.
The Trade Practices Bill introduced
by Australia’s Attorney-General, Mr
B. M. Snedden. on May 19, is still, at
this stage, a curiosity which is available
for examination by all interested parties
before being debated at the next Parlia-
mentary session.
It is clear that the Bill, although out-
lawing collusive tendering and collusive
bidding, permits the business community
to maintain certain existing practices so
long as it tailors its operations to the
broad definitive outlines of the legisla-
tion.
Thus the initial restrictive trade prac-
tices bill envisaged by Sir Garfield Bar-
whck in 1962 is toned down to a more
flexible persuasion. This is not the last
word on the subject, by any means. The
Government obviously has drawn the
teeth from the original plan and is acting
more in the role of a genial parent
setting the offspring on the right road.
But, if you don’t play ball, there is no
doubt that more stringent controls can
be added smartly, despite the fact that
the Commonwealth Act may need com-
plementary legislation by the States.
The guiding hand will be the Tribunal,
headed by a legal man and tw'o experts in
their field. The Tribunal is enjoined to
get along with the parties which may be
brought before them and to look for
solutions in the best interests of the
public.
Even in this area, however, the
Tribunal is screened from the outside
world by the Commissioner of Trade
Practices who, with, his staff, must sort
out the problem and have a compulsory
pre-hearing conference with the parties
involved, with the object of v modifying
the agreement or practice so that offend-
ing aspects are eliminated, thus avoid-
ing the necessity to trouble the Tribunal.
In fact, the Commissioner is the only
person permitted to bring agreements
and practices before the Tribunal for
examination if he believes they are
contrary to the public interest. His is a
monopoly of interpretation, while secrecy
surrounds all.
Secrecy may avoid embarrassment
and permit innocent or non-innocent
parties to correct their mistakes. Yet
silence is not much guidance to the
public.
The Commissioner, and then the
Tribunal in turn, must settle all con-
tentious matters rather than the letter of
the law. Certainly they will operate
within specified boundaries, but even the
Tribunal’s decision is not final.
present Bill provides for appeal to a
Review Division of the Tribunal on the
grounds of inconsistency with a previous
decision of the Tribunal, importance in
the public interest, or a material error
of law.
The effectiveness of the proposed
legislation is open to debate and some
clear definitions will need to be pub-
lished by the Commissioner and the
Tribunal, based on their working con-
clusions. Otherwise unnecessary con-
fusion and time-wasting could result.
Aye, Dr MLC
HThe £4 million write-offs and bad debt
provisions by H. G. Palmer (Con-
solidated) Ltd, the chain electrical retail
patient of Dr MLC, suggest that £1 out
of every £8 was bad, assuming that the
rot has been stopped.
Experience of some of the other
finance groups, including financiers like
Deposit and Investment which are not
engaged in electrical appliance selling,
is that further w'rite-offs occur. H. G.
Palmer, in fact, has indicated that some-
thing like £250,000 may need to be
w'ritten-off following a review' of stocks.
Fortunately, Dr MLC has plenty of
medicine in his bag and already has
prescribed a dose of £3.6m. preference
capital.
The dangers of high-pressure electrical
appliance selling have been demon-
strated for years, with an imposing list
SIR GARFIELD BARWICK
of casualties in this field. The share-
holders in H. G. Palmer who, two years
ago, exchanged their holdings for life
assurance shares (in a market deal worth
£4.2m.) must have breathed a sigh of
relief last week, particularly when the
MLC came out with a higher profit and
dividend.
Professorial Sense
Friday’s presidential address to
the NSW Branch of the Economic
Societv by Professor H R. Edwards
turned out to be a fine example of
academic nracticabilitv. The rather
general title. “Some Current Problems of
Economic Policy”, covered a concen-
trated discussion of the wage-price situa-
tion in Australia.
Fathering incomes policies is a some-
what fashionable exercise these da-/s,
among both economists and govern-
ments. The policies mostlv seem to
demand new institutional organisations
and a fair measure of regulation. Yet
Professor Edwards, bv the end of his
address, had still left a vital place for
the traditional and Australian
arbitration system. Indeed, he managed
to find new-uses for it.
The crux of his argument derived
from the extremely important position
of over-award payments in the wage
structure. These undoubfedlv must be
accepted as a fact of life, though far
from complacently, despite the latest
comparatively small rise in the Con-
sumer Price Index.
“When actual wages increase this way
(i.e., through over-award payments) un-
der market pressure almost as fast as
the increase in average productivity in
the economy, there is very little ‘room’
for award increases by the Arbitration
Commission without causing inflation.
But there are some employees in weak


bargaining positions who receive little
or nothing of the award rate,” Professor
Edwards argues.
Further, “The Commission has thus
been bound to make general award (basic
wage and margins) increases which,
however, accrue to all workers, including
those enjoying the market-won increases,
so that the overall increase is inflated,
making for higher prices.”
Some official recognition of the status
of over-award payments and the potential
advantages of give-and-take in industrial
bargaining must inevitably come. Why
not establish a norm for increases in
actual wages, Edwards suggests, allow-
ing the Commission gradually to “take
over a new role, namely as a forum
where the Government, representatives
of the unions and the employers hammer
out this very issue”.
The professor supports the oft-pro-
posed economic secretariat for the Com-
mission, naming its first task “a compre-
hensive survey of over-award payments
iff the economy who actually gets
them, the amount, the reason for pay-
ments and so on”.
US and UK Markets
"AS/hile Australian sharemarkets last
week tried manfully to drag them-
selves upwards by the leaders’ bootstraps,
on narrow ranges and turnovers, the
local mood of uncertainty struck both
New York and London, though naturally
in different measures.
Wall Street's basically mild air of cau-
tion repeated itself on Friday with a five
point drop in the Dow Jones industrials
index, almost the same as on Thursday.
The foreign situation appears to be the
main instigator of care, good quality
stocks losing a few points and volumes
remaining low.
There has been a fair amount of profit
taking among motors, aluminiums and
airlines. Leaders in many sections were
prominently affected.
In London, grimmer economic news
made Friday the worst day since the
April Budget, the “Financial Times’ ”
index shedding 12.6 points to reach
344.9. The year’s high so far is 359.1.
Britain's factory output for March
declined, in a period of remarkably low
unemployment. Prices showed their
greatest single monthly leap for ten years.
And the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr
James Callaghan, let slip on television
that the credit squeeze “had hardly
started yet”.
Under these impulsions, equities
throughout the list went lower, though
gilt-edged held reasonably well. Banks
stayed fairly firm, but even the generally
healthy base metals were influenced by
the uneasy altitude.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Setting Fresh Sights
For Steel
Thoughts on a BHP occasion
Australian steelmakers probably feel
more frustrated than most of us
when the nation's overseas funds snow-
ball and heavy steel imports are sharing
prominently in the shoving. This being
the position at the moment, the theme at
BHP’s anniversary celebration next week
to mark fifty years of steel-making at
Newcastle might be “We have done very
well but we must do better”. In this
period Australia has risen to be fifth
(1963) on the list of ingot steel-consum-
ing countries on a per capita basis and
ninth (1964) on the list of free world
producing countries, just behind India.
This is the long-term measure of BHP’s
SIR IAN MCLENNAN
achievement since it crossed the bridge
from the “big mine” to lead the advance
of Australia’s industrial troops.
Writing about two years ago, former
BHP economist, Professor N. R. Wills,
now of the University of NSW, in his
chapter on steel in “The Economics of
Australian Industry”, thought the main
problem ahead for BHP would be to find
export markets for surpluses. In his
words, “While steel-making and rolling
facilities go on expanding at their present
rate, permanent export markets will be
needed to absorb an increased percentage
of the industry’s ingot equivalent.”
Further, he laid down this challenge
to BHP: “If by means of exported steel
in semi-finished or manufactured form
BHP is able to assist Australia to con-
vert its all-too-frequent deficits on trading
account into continued surpluses, the
company will have more than justified
its special place in the Australian
economy.”
Such statements hardly imply that this
authority on steel (he is at present writing
a fuller account of the industry) was
being haunted by the possibility of a
period just ahead when heavy net imports
of steel (about £2O million a year rate
in March this year) would be weighing
uncomfortably heavily on the balance of
payments. For him, it seems, we had put
such strains behind us with the passing
of the 1960-61 steel imports upsurge. In
the future, steel would see its relationship
to the balance of payments in terms of a
sustained net export performance.
Wills talked of BHP still being “a little
apprehensive about the long-run export
possibility”. As Sir Colin Syme has
made abundantly clear in his chairman’s
addresses, to retain export markets on a
permanent basis you have to guarantee
uninterrupted supplies. The export mar-
ket is highly competitive—always with
some other supplier waiting to grab your
share if you fail to deliver regularly.
Your steel may be relatively cheaper, but
it must be in permanent supply to a par-
ticular market to keep that market. If
peak home demand can only be accom-
modated by sacrificing exports, the ex-
port game on a wide permanent scale
becomes a gamble.
You can’t treat exports as a sort of
safety valve to be shut off to the dicta-
tion of home demand. As we know, in
1960-61, when home demand peaked, ex-
ports had to be sacrificed to try to meet
it. Then two years of recessed home
demand followed. BHP's bid to dispose
of surpluses of most products in export
markets had only a very limited success.
In any case it had to reduce its output.
The recession in home demand left BHP
on a limb and exports failed to rescue it.
To get into export markets on the
basis envisaged by Wills entails that you
must have steel-making capacity in ex-
cess of that required to meet peak home
demand. The dilemma is that peaks in
home demand occur at irregular and not
easily predictable intervals (even BHP
economists are sometimes astray in their
forecasts). You are thus vulnerable to
being left with unused capacity, with con-


sequent increases in unit costs, on your
hand. The margin of capacity over aver-
age home demand is critical.
The cyclical upturns in home demand
for steel have so far defied BHP’s efforts
to build sufficient capacity to meet the
peaks. Thus, both in 1960-61 and 1964-
65 (not to speak of an even more hectic
flow of imports in the early 19505), the
gap between local output and supplies
has had to be met by imports.
It is all very well, speaking with hind-
sight, to be critical of the scale of BHP's
capacity expansion programme, that it
has not been aggressive enough to avoid
these periodic bursts in imports and,
more ideally, to ensure a high regular
flow of exports. Certainly, high steel im-
ports can be very expensive in balance
of payments terms and they usually occur
when they are least wanted in these
terms. The failure for a country endowed
as ours is with vast high-grade iron ore
deposits to, as yet, establish steel
as one of its major export earners may
seem, on the face of it, incongruous.
(Steel exports last year brought in £35
million, or about 24 per cent of total
export receipts of £1382 million, the
main export markets being NZ, west
coast USA, Canada and South-East
Asia.)
Critics are entitled to be impatient (as
“The Australian” was the other day).
BHP must be urged on to cut through
the intricate web of its problems. The
possible usefulness of a competitor must
not idly be disregarded. Yet delving into
the historical progress of this company,
particularly in the period since 1952,
suggests anything but complacency in
BHP's planning to meet the critics’ ob-
jectives. We are entitled to be in a hurry,
but the pace cannot be quicker than the
circumstances dictate.
In the vagaries of the economic and
labor (particularly coal) climates of the
early post-war period, BHP's reluctance
to step up its under-used capacity is
understandable (ingot capacity rose from
1.8 to only 2.1 million tons between
1946 and 1952). It really grasped the
nettle in the next ten years after 1952.
Mammoth imports of nearly three mil-
lion tons in 1951-52 really stung it into
action. Between 1952 and 1962 ingot
capacity bounded from 2.1 to 4.4 mil-
lion tons, an average annual increase of
1 1 per cent. The subsequent rise to the
present 5.2 million tons was achieved in
a period when, at least at the beginning,
industrial planners could be excused a
little reticence about the general econ-
omic outlook. BHP's actual ingot produc-
tion in 1952 was only 1.5 million tons,
but last year it exceeded 5 million tons
for the first time in any one year. We
should not be too unsatisfied by the per-
formance, nor with the prospect for
capacity.
The hard fact in the present situation
is that the latest burgeoning in the local
demand for steel has caught BHP in
the mid-stream of a vigorous expansion,
both of ingot capacity and rolling plant.
Furthermore, completion of new ingot
capacity is running faster than finishing
plant can be installed fully to take up
the possible ingot output. Within two
years, when with the duplication of the
first oxygen-making unit sufficient new
oxygen can be produced at Whyalla to
make fully balanced production possible
from the new steel-making complex
there, this will in itself lift BHP’s
capacity from its present 5.2 million
tons to 6.2 million, not counting any
additions to capacity at Port Kembla
and Newcastle (where a further basic
oxygen plant is being planned). Even as
things stand at the moment, Whyalla is
moving rapidly towards an output of
500,000 tons a year rate, following its
first production of ingots from its new
basic oxygen plant in February. This
should help considerably in saving im-
ports of steel within the next few months.
BHP will not put a figure on the likely
level of its steel ingot capacity in two
years’ time, but, with Whyalla and New-
castle’s new plants to feed a forthcom-
ing continuous casting machine, it could
be possibly 64 to 7 million tons of ingots,
or as much as 40 per cent above current
production levels. The question for BHP
economists is what happens in the in-
terim to home demand. One cannot rule
out the possibility that the rate of increase
could ease in the context of a more sober
economy and more heightened competi-
tion from other materials such as alumin-
ium and plastics. At any rate, a rise of
40 per cent in two years would not seem
to be out of the question, so it may be
BHP will then be set to follow Professor
Wills on a big export foray.
CROESUS
Share Prices and Prosperity
Comfort for long-term investors
Tn times- like this, when investors are
A shy of buying shares, stockbrokers
spend rather more time than usual
musing over reasons why prices are fail-
ing to mirror the glowing prosperity of
the economy. There is general accept-
ance, it seems, on certain of the grounds
for the present malaise.
Most brokers point to continued tax
selling as a blighting influence; others to
the obscure balance of payments outlook,
some even fearing a crisis developing
some time next year. Narrowed profit
margins and “profitless expansion” of a
wide range of industry, coupled with
fears that margins could well shrink
further after the basic wage judgment
and that company turnovers will not rise
sufficiently to offset them, loom large
in the market's mind.
Again, the markets hear of a continued
plague of bad debts in the appliances
industry, of which H. G. Palmer is the
latest awful example. It is suggested,
too, that the upper layers of motor car
sales are being financed largely on paper
that the Hire Purchase Conference com-
panies will not touch and that a good
deal of it will eventually come home to
roost in bad debts.
On top of all this is the general expec-
tation that, despite the valiant effort of
the trading banks to let out more credit
(as witness the April jump of £64.4 mil-
lion in trading bank advances), the liquid-
ity squeeze will go on for another six
months or so.
Combined with everything to dampen
the prospects for a spirited market re-
vival is the further thought that portfolio
investment from overseas has dried up
(last year it was only £l7 million against
the peak of £484 million in 1960-61) and
is unlikely to reassert itself as a market
influence in the foreseeable future. So
even if one turned a blind eye to the
possibility, mentioned here from time to
time in the last five months, that the
economy could be in for a much rougher
passage, there are plenty of logical rea-
sons why markets could remain in the
doldrums for a considerable time yet.
Some will doubtless take heart from
last week's observations by the chairman
of Jonathan Investments that “investors
will in due course pay more attention to
the promise of longer-term rewards than
in the possibility of short-term prob-
lems”. But, for the time being, only the
brave and those such as the institutions
who buy to hold long-term and who
naturally see depressed share prices as
a blessing in disguise will be following
Mr Ricketson’s advice to take advantage
of the current situation to add good
cheap shares to their portfolios. They
may get in while the going is good, as it
were, because the Budget may not be so
harsh as expected and they could be
buying on a rising market.
This long-term optimism from the
House of Were has always paid off for
investors in the best Australian shares
when buyers have been prepared to sit
through the ups and downs of the mar-
ket. If anybody is unconvinced of this,
I suggest he should get hold of lan Pot-
ter and Co.’s April, 1965 edition of
“Selected Australian Ordinary Shares” or
Ralph W. King and Yuill’s “Investment


Review of Australian Companies, 1965”
and do a little homework. These pre-
cious volumes can make you forget about
short-term problems and that there is
any such thing as an index of ordinary
share prices. They are calculated to
make you rush to clean out dead docu-
ments from the safe to make way for
some carefully selected new scrip.
For instance, Potter's statisticians
come up with 84 out of about 200 selec-
ted Australian industrial companies which
have given their holders, who bought in
1958, more than a 100 p.c. capital profit
over the period to April this year (pro-
vided, of course, they are still holding).
Indeed, 33 of these show a capital gain
of more than 200 p.c. and several of
them very considerably more, up to 800
p.c.
As with Potters, Ralph W. King and
Yuill have discounted for bonus issues
and the bonus element in cash issues in
their examination of the performance
of 233 companies. The overall capital
appreciation shown by the shares of
these 233 companies over the last five
years was 28 p.c., including 66 shares
which showed a capital loss (averaging
26.9 p.c.). Of the 167 companies whose
shares showed capital appreciation to
holders since 1959, the average apprecia-
tion was 49.6 p.c.
Over the same five years gross national
product rose by 45.7 p.c. So even if on
average the percentage capital gain of
28 p.c. of the 233 companies was well
below the percentage rise in GNP, at
least the average gain in 167 of the 233
beat it (some of them by a very sub-
stantial margin). This, of course, is not
counting the interim rise in the annual
return on the shares concerned after
taking bonus issues and the bonus
element in cash issues into account. Who
said selective long-term investment
doesn’t pay off!
Those in no hurry to take Mr Ricket-
son’s advice, that everything will come
very right for them in the end, may
prefer to go to the May circular of Mel-
bourne broking firm McKinley Wilson
and Co. This document is calculated to
make you pause and possibly to anger
you. It is not that the broker has lost
his faith “the situation is most promis-
ing” only that he wants you “to get
with the strength”, that is with foreign-
owned enterprise, particularly US, whose
shares are listed here (“for those in-
terested we also have available in our
office a table of locally listed companies
with UK parent majority holding!”).
After considerable research, McKinley
Wilson and Co. have developed a theory
which may possibly help to explain the
enigma why Australian share prices have
failed to reflect the full strength of in-
dustrial development these last few years.
Cutting a long story short, they find it
is because too large a proportion of the
most profitable concerns in Australia are
not listed on the stock exchanges. I
don’t doubt for a moment that this theory
is already very familiar to the likes of
Mr Ricketson and Mr G. C. Crane,
chairman of the AMP, both of whom
have long been vocal stalwarts of the
movement to get more local participa-
tion in the equity of overseas-owned
enterprises. The theory is put forward
here not necessarily in support of their
cause, but as throwing light on the
relationship between stock exchange
movements and economic activity in this
country.
The broking firm takes as its starting
point the established fact that in the
United States a close long-term correla-
tion exists between share price move-
ments and the rate of growth in gross
national products. On the basis of this
correlation market analysts in the US
W. KEITH YUILL
three years ago extrapolated that the
Dow Jones industrials index would move
into the 900 range by 1965. This has
proved correct. However, while in Aus-
tralia the brokers have found a close
correlation between share prices and
GNP up to 1947-48, since then there has
been a marked divergence. Share prices
have lagged sadly behind.
They argue from this that there must
be some special reason for the lag and
find it in the increasing share of GNP
contributed by companies which are not
publicly listed in Australia. They instance
the big increase that has taken place in
direct overseas investment since 1948,
say, and that in large measure no local
equity has resulted. Then comes the
punch line to illustrate that US and UK
subsidiaries operating here, who have
used this capital inflow, have a superior
rate of profitability to the average of
top Australian companies.
They show that for the year to the
end of April, 1964, the median returns
(that is, net income before interest pay-
ments and taxation) on total funds em-
ployed averaged out at 10.3 p.c. for the
900 top companies in Australia, whereas
for the major US subsidiaries in Aus-
tralia it averaged 15.7 p.c. and for the
major UK subsidiaries 11.6 p.c. Because
the higher returns of overseas-owned
enterprises accrue to non-listed com-
panies, it is deduced that local share
markets are bound not to reflect them.
As they come into GNP it is logical
that there should be a divergence in
movements between GNP and share
prices.
It is perfectly true that a big section
of industry is foreign-owned and that
the amount of local equity in it is small.
Mr J. G. Wilson, managing director of
APM, has put the percentage of second-
ary industry which is foreign-owned as
up to 30 p.c. (Senator Gorton’s figure
is 25 p.c.), but in many industries it is
substantially higher. It is thought to be
about 95 p.c. in pharmaceuticals, 95
in petroleum and motor manufacturing,
85 in oil exploration and production, 83
in telecommunications, 80 in soap and
detergents, 75 in bauxite mining and
aluminium, 60 in chemicals and 55 p.c.
in motor vehicles’ components. In food,
it is 50 p.c. and in several other in-
dustries, more than 10 p.c.
It is also true that only a fringe of
overseas - owned companies have any
local equity participation. Even for
those who do, the percentage is usually
very small. Ironically enough, a small
local equity participation usually results,
for good companies at any rate, in stock
exchanges rather overstating the value of
the shares concerned because of the
scarcity value of the limited number of
shares in Australian hands.
However, in my view, the brokers
have rather overstated their case because
in the graph provided it is obvious that,
after the “gap” between GNP and share
prices opened up in the early ’fifties,
the rate of growth in GNP since 1951
has moved pretty well in line with the
long-term trend in share prices over the
last 14 years. There is point in the claim,
though, because clearly the superior
returns on foreign-owned investment do
in fact find only a pale reflection in Aus-
tralian share market prices.
Naturally the brokers draw a pertinent
corollary from their exercise—to invest
in listed foreign-owned companies with
a measure of local equity. Their list is
instructive, including (local equity per-
centage in parenthesis): Australian
Chemicals Holdings (50), Bliss Welded
Products (50), Borg Warner, Formfit
(Aust.) (47), Philip Morris (36), Mt Isa
Mines (44), Sporting Arms (50) and
F. W. Williams (50).

The answer is Queensland the eleven are the Ports of
Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhamp-
ton, Mackay, Bowen, Townsville, Lucinda, Mourilyan and
Cairns.
With the completion of current projects Queensland will have
more major ports than the rest of Australia put together.
By this yardstick, as by most, Queensland is ready to meet
the needs of dramatically developing industries.
Queensland is the most decentralised of all the Australian
States, its natural wealth, population and industries being
spread over a very wide area. As a result, expenditure on
development has covered the same wide pattern. Cities and
towns throughout the State can provide all the services
manufacturers look for. These include power, water supply,
sewerage, industrial sites, skilled labour, road, rail, sea and air
transport. Local Authority rates and services, land values and
building costs in Queensland compare more than favourably
with those in other Australian States.
Queensland for years has known where she is going and has
planned for the future on a scale corresponding to her size
and growth capacity.
In its friendly tradition, Queensland has created an organisa-
tion to assist prospective investors in local industry. The
Director of the new Department of Industrial Development,
Sir David Muir, and his well informed senior staff will be
pleased to advise you objectively on all matters of industrial
significance. As a preliminary, why not write for data on the
facilities at Queensland’s eleven overseas ports?

Australia’s First Great Farm
Camden Park still up-to-the-minute
By M. H. ELLIS
Damden Park, 160 years old this
month, is Australia's first pastoral
property; its first great farm, and today
the last word in modern farming.
Its history began really in 1788 or
1789, when the wild cattle belonging
to Governor Phillip found their way
down to the pastures not far from where
the Rotolactor now stands, and increased
and multiplied until 1795. Then the
kangaroo shooter of an officer at Parra-
matta the evidence points to John
Macarthur reported their presence to
Governor Hunter and he went down
with a party to observe the herd.
This was a discovery of enormous
importance, for there was little or no
fresh meat in the Colony at any time.
In fact, outside kangaroo meat and pup-
py, there was scarcely any meat at all
that did not come out of a cask in the
first five years of settlement. It was quite
an event when visiting Spaniards killed
an old cow they had with them in 1793.
Now here was a fat' herd grazing on
fine pastures on open flats along the
Nepean and the lagoons that still exist,
there as in the early days the haunt of
the black swans that fly over from Dee-
why or some other enclosed water every
evening round sundown, scarcely noticed
now by the spread of Sydney below them.
John Macarthur in the late 1790 s had
his main estate on Elizabeth Farm, now
at Harris Park, and a grass farm at Seven
Hills. He was not the earliest farmer to
breed up a flock of sheep. That honor
belongs to Edward Elliott, who shared in
the distribution of Governor Phillip’s
sheep at the end of 1792 and, unlike
others of his kind, preserved and added to
his animals. Macarthur very much later
claimed to have secured some Bengal
and Irish sheep. But in 1794 he does not
catalogue any among his livestock. A
little later he began to accumulate them.
He bought some of the big-bodied Dutch-
Spanish stock from Gordon’s farm in
South Africa when Captain Waterhouse
brought them over in the Reliance in
1797.
Sheep were multiplying in the early
days of Governor Hunter’s period and
Mrs Macarthur, in September 1798,
writes of the extent of their farm. At
Elizabeth Farm they had from 30 to 40
men and women at work, according to
the season, including eight stock keepers.
They certainly needed them with pre-
datory convicts all round, beef 4s. to ss.
a pound, a good horse worth up to £l5O,
an English cow selling for £lOO. The
Macarthurs had about the largest holding
of stock in the country already —5O
cattle, a dozen horses and about a thou-
sand sheep. But they were not yet “being
so extravagant as to kill mutton”. They
were building their flocks and grading
them up from hairy goats into wool-bear-
ing sheep.
It was not until 1805 that Camden
Park grew out of the work already done
at Elizabeth Farm. It might never have
happened at all. In 1800, Macarthur,
sick of the quarrels of Port Jackson
settlement and saddened by the lack of
opportunity for promotion, decided to
sell out and return to England. He offered
his property with its livestock to the
Government. By this time he had 600
wool sheep which he valued at £l5OO.
And it was out of this offer that the wool
industry was born. Shortly afterwards,
having bought 1300 more sheep from
Colonel Foveaux, Macarthur decided to
stay in New South Wales a little longer.
Governor King sent home some of the
fleeces to Sir Joseph Banks, the patron of
the King’s Spanish Flock. These fleeces
caused some excitement among the wool
trade in England, which was suffering
embarrassment through the shortage and
dearness of Spanish fleeces. These had to
be carried through waters sadly harassed
by the French.
So John Macarthur, arriving in
England at the right moment at the end
of 1802 after a long roundabout voyage
of over a year, had the manufacturers
pounce on him. Within a couple of years
he was off to New South Wales with a
grant of 5000 acres of land and promise
of 5000 more, to make the first essay
in the fine wool industry. He had been
allowed to buy seven of the King's sheep
from Kew, the best ram among them with
a fleece of about 7 lbs 2 ozs, about a
seventh of the cut from a champion
merino ram today. Macarthur had the
rare privilege of being able to take them
out of England in his new ship Argo.
In June, 1805, he arrived in New South
Wales with Walter Davidson, a nephew
of his patron, Sir Robert Farquhar, the
King’s physician, his nephew Hannibal,
and two young men named Wood, sent
out to teach the art of wool sorting.
Almost at once he and Davidson were
camped in a hut at Benkennie, near the
lagoons on the west side of the Nepean,
and demanding that Governor King grant
Macarthur his 5000 acres around Mt
Taurus, from which King had spied the
wild cattle grazing a year or so before.
Davidson was granted 2000 acres.
King ,was very loth to make this grant,
but soon Macarthur and Davidson were
in possession of the fertile flats along the

Nepean which now grow the pasture to
feed the Rotolactor cattle of 1965. It was
pleasant, open country, treed with huge
iron barks, some of which provided the
handsome mellowed brown pillars of
Camden Park House. At first there was
only the hut at Benkennie, near the
Nepean ford, for a home, with no other
dwelling nearer than the region of
Liverpool. When Macarthur sailed for
England in 1809 the Benkennie hut qften
housed his wife, tending their growing
flocks. There had been interruption in
their progress, for King did all he
could to prevent the land being deeded.
He was uneasy about what might happen
to the colony’s meat reserve, the “wild
cattle”, and had some ideas of grabbing
the land for himself along with the cattle.
When King went away there was Bligh,
who visited the place in the rain and
thundered, having damned all Mac-
arthur's sheep to perdition, with such
heartiness that poor King, who was pre-
sent and a nervous breakdown case,
burst into tears.
T>ut matters came right with the Mac-
quarie era and then, gradually, the
farm evolved. The stud sheep were still
kept at Camden Park until 1820, but the
flocks at Camden Park were systemati-
cally built up, the first in the country to
be properly earmarked and registered
along with the records of their clips.
There was soon quite a traffic to the
Nepean ford to see what was going on.
Governor Macquarie went there in the
late months of 1810, with Mrs Mac-
quarie, and camped on the old Camping
Ground, on which every governor in the
early days from Hunter onwards rested.
The farm, embraced in the North Bend,
began to be tilled. The first really sub-
stantial clip was sent to England in
1814. The fine, fertile farm in the North
Bend, where today is the modern
orchard with its pears and apples, was
turned over for the first time. When
Macarthur and his two sons James and
William (our first economic botanist)
arrived home in September, 1817, after
the long exile that followed the rebel-
lion, they put in there the two vines
which they had brought with them from
France. These live today. Here, more
than twenty years later, Australia’s first
irrigation system was developed, deliver-
ing 5000 gallons an hour from the river.
Here William Macarthur planted the
country’s oldest camellias and other rare
shrubs, and here, later, went in the trees
that began the English spinney.
By 1820 Camden Park began to
earn the fame that has flavored its life
ever since. It became a huge, diversified
property, very much what it is in 1965,
but with the emphasis on sheep instead
of dairy cattle. It was at Camden Park,

based on experience of the needs of the
market in London, that the methods of
Silesian and Saxon wool men in prepar-
ing wool for sale were adopted, so that
the bales would open attractively on the
auction floor.
Camden Park established the reputa-
tion of Australian wool finally in the
London auction market at the famous
sale at Garraway’s Coffee House, Change
Alley, on August 17, 1821, when the
Camden wools brought prices equal to
the Silesian and Saxon wools, and one
bale of John Macarthur’s fleece sold to
the King’s factory for 10s. 4d. per lb.
By 1830 the estate had begun to
assume the standing it has today. Its
woolstores, full of bales awaiting ship-
ment; its spotless sheds with linen sheets
laid down to keep the shorn wool out of
the dust, attracted growers from all over
New South Wales bent on learning new
methods. It employed, at its peak, 113
men on every kind of farming and wool-
raising work. It imported the latest
machinery. It laid down artificial grasses.
It made wine. Its orchards were prolific
and profitable, as they are today.
Camden Park is the only estate in
Australia which can say that it has
survived for 160 year's in the hands of
one family. The Macarthurs founded it;
the Macarthur blood still controls it.
Its size has varied immensely, spreading
and contracting with drought and family
fortune or misfortune. Today it is about
8000 acres. Sheep went out in the 1840 s
but some were brought back to form the
exhibition flock of pure merinos of the
old type that the estate keeps as an
historic curiosity. Farmers came there
mainly to learn sheep husbandry.
rpoDAY Camden practices very mixed
farming but carried on under very
different conditions from those of the
earliest days, when it was on the
very outskirts of civilisation and the
family held the sole right of crossing
the Nepean without securing a passport.
It is now right on the suburbs of Camden,
with Campbelltown reaching out for its
borders though still some way away.
The main present occupation is dairy-
ing. Many farmers come from all over
the continent to see its pasture improve-
ments and irrigation schemes with their
giant “walking sprays” whose eight 85ft
sections can cover the whole area of the
Menangle flats with two inches of water
in 100 hours. Lady Stanham and her
son farm the thousand acres of the
Home Farm, which includes the mansion.
The rest is a huge enterprise managed
by the Camden Park Estate. It has five
farms with separate dairy farmers and
herds. But the great attraction is the
Rotolactor,
Camden Park is a fascinating property
full of variety—an orchard here with
pigs foraging fallen apples through its
rows; a pear orchard; historic buildings;
spots where this or that famous visitor
camped in the earliest days; irrigation
dams and Keyline channels, with groups
of farmers learning their modus operandi ;
huge pumps operating; trees being
planted. Yet change everywhere keeps
pace with the age, as has been the custom
for 160 years. Always there is a Mac-
arthur-Onslow somewhere about, in-
variably busy, as they have been since
John Macarthur came to Camden lagoons
on a June day in 1805.
They like to see the estate farming
moving ahead of the times. They are
always up-to-the-minute. Like Old John,
who sleeps up on top of the Chinaman’s
Hat hill, and who was the first man in
Australia to use a plough, the men of
Macarthur blood seem always a jump
ahead of their age.

Buildings not for Burning
The standards of fire protection
rPHE three causes of fire, an insurance
executive once said, are men,
women and children. There is no reason
to doubt that this does not hold true
today. Yet an increasing awareness and
use of fire protection and detection de-
vices is probably the major reason why
fire claims are not mounting more
rapidly than they are.
According to the Australian Fire Pro-
tection Association, “a non-profit techni-
cal and educational organisation to safe-
guard life and property against fire”, the
Australian fire record for 1964 approxi-
mately equalled the record property loss
of the previous year. Claims paid by
insurance companies in 1963-64 totalled
£20.1 million—an increase of more than
£33 million over the previous year's
total of £16.5 million.
Part of this increase can be attributed
to the disastrous fire at Townsville sugar
terminal, the cost of which is estimated
to be over £5 million. While the cost of
fire rises each year, it is interesting to
compare costs in protected and unpro-
tected buildings.
The association has published a list
of “sprinklered risks” and “unsprinklered
risks”. The total loss in the 59 fires in
sprinklered risks (which includes shops,
motor assembly plants, furniture fac-
tories, printers and factories) was
£59,861, or roughly £lOOO per fire.
During 1964 there were 61 fires in un-
sprinklered risks in the same classifica-
tions. The total loss was £2,311,000, or
nearly £38,000 per fire. The associa-
tion says automatic sprinkler systems
successfully controlled 211 fires “and
there was no change in the satisfactory
performance ... of the systems from the
previous year’s level of 99.67 p.c. . . .
The performance of automatic sprinklers
for the year was 100 p.c. satisfactory”.
As the association’s figures show, com-
merce and industry cannot afford to be
without fire protection, in the same way
as it cannot afford fires. For installing
fire protection devices the businessman
is offered attractive insurance discounts,
some of which range above the 50 p.c.
mark. To get the maximum discount,
buildings should be protected by auto-
matic sprinklers as well as having port-
able fire fighting appliances and a fire
detection system.
Much of the work on fire protection
and detection systems is carried out over-
seas, though companies such as Wormald
Brothers and Fire Fighting Equipment,
two of the leading fire protection con-
cerns in Australia, are constantly striving
to find new and better ways to minimise
and even eliminate fire damage.
Judging from the range of equipment
available to combat fires, it seems that
fires need never start in many places.
Thermal, smoke and combustion detec-
tors, highly sensitive pieces of equipment,
sense potential fires and either audibly
warn of impending danger or extinguish
the fires themselves.
One such piece of equipment is Worm-
aid Bros’ Minerva detector. It is now
being installed in the Townsville sugar
terminal which, - before the costly fire,
was unprotected. It operates on an ele-
ment sensitive to the products of com-
bustion, whether visible or invisible. It
does not depend on smoke or flames to
be triggered, sensing combustion before
it actually takes place.
The fire protection industry claims that
not enough fire protection is being used
in Australia. The industry’s chief com-
plaint is the almost complete lack of pro-
tection in schools. An executive of Fire
Fighting Equipment said: “How the hell
some of these schools have not had
serious fires I don’t know. Some of them

are just sheer firetraps. To make matters
worse, schoolchildren are rarely taught
fire drill.”
The general manager of Wormald
Bros, Mr John Utz, said there was a
great deal of apathy towards fire protec-
tion in public places. ‘"Not only are
most schools unprotected but also hospi-
tals. If ever there’s a fire in some Syd-
ney hospitals, some of which are obvious
firetraps, it would be a real tragedy and
one that could have been avoided so
easily,” he said.
Legislation by the various govern-
ments to ensure fire protection in all pub-
lic places, even if it does give the fire
protection companies some good busi-
ness, should be enacted immediately. It
is a wonder there were not more trage-
dies recorded last year from fires in
public places. The Fire Protection Asso-
ciation recorded 169 fires in hotels and
hostels, 188 in schools and 117 in hos-
pitals during 1964.
Although it does not record the deaths
in these three categories, the association
points out that “when it is remembered
that for each fatality, approximately 10
persons suffer serious burns, this kind of
accident occurs far too frequently”. A
total of 191 people died in Australia in
1964 as a result of fires.
While the standard of fire protection
available in Australia is claimed to be the
best in the world, “there is a danger”,
said John Utz, “that what is happening
in America could happen here. There,
sprinkler systems are only about 96 p.c.
satisfactory as far as their performance
is concerned.
“There has been a general lowering of
standards due to price cutting and com-
petition and the buyer is not always
getting the highest quality workmanship
and materials available.”
There is, unfortunately, evidence of
such a trend already in Australia, The
Bulletin was told. One fire protection
engineer quoted the case of a company
“which has been in and out of business
five times in the last five years. It goes
in, installs a sprinkler system, and the
owner finds that, when the insurance
company inspects it, it is well below the
standards required.
“By the time the faults are rectified
the cost of the system is well above what
a reputable company would have
charged.”
The alliance between fire protection
companies and the insurance companies
is providing a strong impetus for greater
and improved protection. Architects, too,
are helping by stressing the need for pro-
tection in new buildings they design.
Such co-operation will not only mean ex-
panded markets for the fire protection
companies but could eventually see fewer
and cheaper fires with fewer lost lives.

Bad Debts Maelstrom
Picking up chips for H. G. Palmer
A tender and doubtless deserved
respect for the MLC seems to
have muted criticism of the shocking
bad-debt situation w'hich has struck its
appliance - retailing subsidiary H. G.
Palmer (Consolidated) Ltd. A few dis-
gruntled policyholders may perhaps be
w'ondering whether a better use could
not have been found for some £2.5
million of insurance funds than to
direct them into preference shares de-
ferred of dividend, entitled only to such
dividends as declared from time to
time.
Struck may be hardly the correct word
in this instance, since rumors of bad-
debt problems within H- G. Palmer were
even current before the MLC’s dramatic
takeover in 1963. Palmer’s widespread
and vigorously pressed dealings certainly
left themselves open to rumor-laden
gossip. The position was not aided by
the absence of any definite provision in
yearly accounts. These merely repeated
a general assurance that “bad debts
which are proved have been progres-
sively written off from year to year”.
The amount now' up for debts write-
off totals £4 million £2.5 million in
actual bad time-payment and hire-pur-
chase paper, £1.5 million in doubtful.
Investigation of Palmer stock values
,might also call for a £250,000 write-
down.
Such a position can scarcely have
arisen suddenly, and it must be hoped
that the MLC will be firm and forth-
coming in explanation. Meanwhile it
brings salvation to Palmer, offsetting the
losses by itself taking up £3,625.000 of
preference capital, the remaining
£375.000 being subscribed by Palfarrt
Investments Pty Ltd, Mr H. G. Palmer’s
private family company.
Of the issue only £H million carries
an immediate 7 p.c. dividend.
News of the troubles tended to over-
shadow the MLC’s splendid 28 p.c.
profit rise in the 1964-65 year and an
announced £151,151 profit for Palmer
over the half-year ended December 31.
The Australian Hire Purchase and
Finance Conference (NSW Division)
respectably states: “The main reason for
the bad debts incurred by some retailers
is that the granting of credit is too much
under pressure from their sales depart-
ments.” Will somebody please define
“sales”?
Betting on Bramac
TTopes for the first dividend since 1959-
60 were raised at the recent annual
meeting of Bramac, the Melbourne-based
manufacturer of rainwear and industrial
rubber goods. The chairman, Mr G. C.
Tootell, told shareholders that if the
improvement in profits w'as maintained,
and the increase was sufficient, a divi-
dend may be considered for the current
year to December 31.
The 1964 year was the company’s
best for ages, and the £43,000 net profit
returned 7.4 p.c. on capital which had
unfortunately been increased rather
heavily during the year. Shares were
issued to Greengate and Irwell of
England (it has more than 60 p.c. of
Bramac’s capital) as part payment for
the loans it had extended to keep the

Sales and profits in the March quarter
of .the current year have been higher and
business is still rising, especially on the
industrial-conveyor belting side where
the low level of competitive imports is
giving Bramac a good run. Neverthe-
less, it remains a guess for the gamblers
whether a dividend will be paid this year
or not. At best, it seems that 5 p.c.
could be paid, as in 1959-60. At worst,
directors may hang onto their liquid
funds and continue to consolidate and
strengthen the company’s position, as
they have been trying to do for some
time now.
Bramac Ltd is examined in detail in
“Behind the Balance Sheets” on page 75.
Television Float
XpAST Coast Television Ltd, whose
public issue of 320,000 ss. shares
at par has just been announced, is the
last company of “phase four” TV de-
velopment to float. The issue will
actually double paid capital, making it
£160,000.
The relatively high level of pre-
flotation capital gives the company one
advantage: it can go on air as soon as
the PMG builds the transmitter, to be
situated 18 miles from the office-"and
studios at Taree. The PMG will both
build and operate the transmitter and
tower, which is to be used by a national
station and East Coast’s station ECN
Channel 8.
Viewing population of the NSW mid-
coast area covered is estimated at
80,000 permanent and 40,000 floating.
Though television shares in general
do not look particularly buoyant at
present, some of the newer country
operators are worth watching. East
Coast’s issue affords some priority to
residents of the area, but wider public
subscription is invited. The under-
writers are Simpson and Anschau, of
Sydney Stock Exchange.
Expanding Woollens
VI/angaratta Woollen’s one-for-four
” par issue reflects both the success
and the expansion which the company is
enjoying at present. The issue is the
first call for cash from shareholders in
about 15 years. This does not mean
they have gone without capital benefits
for all of this period. The last issue
was a one-for-five bonus late in 1960.
Total raising will be £99,000. Share-
holders were told last year that a con-

would have to continue if the group was
to maintain the position it enjoyed m
the industry. New ideas in spinning
techniques were the mam cause of this.
In 1963-64, £123,000 was spent on new
plant and buildings, and at balance date
there were further capita’, commitments
of about £70,000.
These expenditures were part of a
plan embodying plant modernisation
without the interruption of production.
In fact the only limiting factor to the
speed of the plan was this necessity to
maintain the high rate of production.
A private loan of £50,000 was raised last
year to ensure that the capital pro-
gramme could be undertaken without
encroaching on the working funds
needed for normal operations.
The issue should provide substantial
benefits for shareholders. Although
directors have made no mention of divi-
dends as yet, it is well on the cards that
last year’s 12i p.c. rate will be main-
tained. It was covered by earnings of
25.5 p.c. made after sales had reached
an all-time peak. The interim report for
the six months to the end of last Novem-
ber showed that the trend was con-
tinuing. After increased sales, profit
jumped more than 20 p.c. from £44,000
to £53,000.
Innocuous Gordon
/Gordon and Gotch, stationer, book-
seller, etc., came out with its usual
innocuous statement about the latest
year to March 31. The dividend is to
be held at 20 p.c. after another “satis-
factory” result, to quote the directors.
Following precedent, shareholders must
wait until the annual report to see just
how well the group has fared. No pre-
liminary profit figures are released. Last
year’s report and balance sheet came out
on June 6.
It showed that profits had risen from
£511,000 to a record £560,000, to equal
32.1 p.c. on capital. This profit had
been described in the earlier dividend
announcement as “most satisfactory”.
On the basis of this, one could possibly
assume that the “satisfactory” profit of
1964-65 will not show quite as good an
increase as last year’s “most satisfactory”
result.
All very confusing, to say the least.
In past years, directors have shown that
their description does not follow any
consistent pattern. The 1960-61 rise
from £312.000 to £326,000 was
described as “reasonably satisfactory”.
However, the 1961 -62 leap from
£326,000 to £451,000 was only thought
“satisfactory” and the 1962-63 rise to
£511,000 only scored a “satisfactory”,
too.
At best, one can only venture to say
that the 1964-65 result will be higher
than last year.
Metal Moves
face of Australian aluminium has
A changed once again, this time with
the transfer of William Atkins’ interest
in the metal from Australuco to G. E.
Crane. Atkins will become exclusive dis-
tributor of Crane’s aluminium and will
also handle the group’s copper and brass
products.
With the change in distributorships,
William Atkins announces a premium
issue to raise £200,000. A one-for-six,
shareholders will have to pay 10s. for
each share to which they are entitled. The


issue will lift paid-up capital to £700,000
—— all in ordinary shares.
Funds raised by the issue will finance
the erection of a modern warehouse and
offices near Port Adelaide, say directors.
At present William Atkins subsidiaries
distribute aluminium products of Austra-
luco. However, when the agreements be-
tween these two companies expire later
this year they will not be renewed.
Viva VIA
T7ia’s return to the interim dividend
" list is a welcome one. The company
operates from Melbourne as a timber
merchant and manufacturing engineer.
Its payout for the March six months is
to be 2i p.c. Last year’s final distribu-
tion was 7 p.c. after the interim dividend
had been omitted, to the amazement of
all.
The 1963-64 profit was the best since
1959-60 and came out at £22,000,
equalling 9.5 p.c. on capital. The current
year looks like being substantially
better. Profit in the March half jumped
from £14,000 to £24,000 more than
last year’s full profit. It was after an
increase of only 14 p.c. in sales.
Shareholders will now be considering
the chances of a 10 p.c. dividend for the
year. Although these are not particu-
larly high, they cannot be entirely dis-
counted. The continuance of the profit
trend in the current half would enable
such a payout for the full year, even
allowing for the fact that capital is
higher after the recent note conversion.
Dollars and Cents
Qome early dollars and cents in com-
pany news come from Cuming
Smith and Co. Ltd, investor in the fertil-
iser industry. The company plans to
make a one - for - four premium issue,
with payments due on the shares in Aug-
ust this year, and February and August
next year.
The new shares will be issued at 455.,
a premium of 255. First payment of 15s.
is due on August 20 this year, with a
further 15s. ($1.50) payable on Febru-
ary 18, 1966 (four days after the change-
over to decimal currency), and a final
15s. ($1.50) on August 19, 1966. Paid-
up capital after the issue (which will
raise £900,000 or $l.B million) will be £2
million ($4 million).
Cuming Smith's assets include size-
able shareholdings in chemical and fer-
tiliser companies. It holds 2,357,581
shares in ICIANZ (currently making a
share issue) and has a one-third interest
in CSBP and Farmers Ltd, which plans
to build a £5 million fertiliser plant at
Kwinana, WA.
Company Meeting
PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS TO
The Australian Industries Development Association
ANNUAL MEETING, 10th MAY, 1965
By MR. F. M. WILTSHIRE
In the 42nd Annual Report of the
Australian Industries Development As-
sociation, you will have observed that
our voice has been heard upon a wide
range of subjects important to the
development of Australian industry. In
addition our office in its day by day
activities handles many requests from
members, and inquiries from non-mem-
bers, both here and abroad.
Much of our work involves contact
with Government mostly at departmental
level, at times-' at ministerial level. It
is a pleasure to report that our relations
with Government are uniformly good
and at times fruitful.
All the evidence suggests that your
Association has made a place for itself
in our community and it is listened to
with respect and attention. If some of
our cherished causes are slow to fructify,
this is the way of the democratic process
and not lack of zeal or enterprise.
You will remember that the present
association grew out of the old Protec-
tion League which fought for protection
with great singleness of purpose. The
main battle was won after a long and
frustrating engagement but even today,
as most of us know from hard ex-
perience, there is peripheral skirmishing,
requiring continued vigilance and effort.
Many of the causes we espouse are
of this general kind, that is, they concern
policies basic to the long-term develop-
ment of our industry. We see their need
from the background of our day by day
experience and it is our job in life to
bring other people to an understanding
of them, particularly those with the
power to make them realities.
This is not the place nor is there the
time to dwell on our present pre-
occupations, but I am going to exercise
a president’s prerogative of referring to
one which I believe to have the same
kind of importance to our future in-
dustrial development as protection has
had in the past. I refer to domestic
Industrial Research and Development.
The record of our industrial expansion
over the last twenty-five years is a good
one, one from which we should all draw
a great deal of satisfaction. From a
technological standpoint we have relied
heavily during this period on copied
products and imported knowhow. This
was practical and clear-sighted, and,
moreover it could not have been other-
wise.
It goes without saying that we shall
always import technology, as the largest
industrialised countries do, but we stand
condemned of lack of foresight, or even
muddled thinking, if we fail to promote
domestic Industrial Research and De-
velopment with the utmost vigour
and so far we have failed to do so.
The curious thing about our present
situation is that it is out of character.
We like to think of ourselves as self-
reliant, adaptable, good at improvisation.
We are so convinced of the importance
of science in industry that we began the
Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research back in 1920; and we have a
proper sense of national achievement in
its successes, from which, I might add,
we have gained great profit.
I have said we could be accused of
muddled thinking look at some of our
major national aims: Productivity, ex-
panded technical education, increase in
exports, reduction of commitments in
foreign exchange, increased defence
potential, to mention a few.
If we fail to promote vigorous I.R.
& D. we leave one central function out
of each of these equations.
I do not believe that I have said any-
thing new on this subject. These are
facts well known to responsible people.
Why then is our record so poor in
I.R. & D.?
I have concluded that the answer lies
in the problem of finding a practical
method of stimulation, having in mind
the diversity of Australian industry and
its stage of development. A number of
earnest official attempts have been made
to encourage this work, but those who
have been directly involved would be
the first to agree that they have failed;
that, for example, the institutional
approach so brilliantly applied by
C.5.1.R.0. to primary industry has been
defeated by the complexity of secondary
and tertiary industry.
We have an answer in this Association,
a simple, forthright answer to this ad-
mittedly complex problem. We believe
that a double tax deduction for all
expenditure incurred on domestic I.R.
& D. will get tc the heart of the matter
and generate the kind of activity so ’
manifestly needed.
Such an incentive will reach into every
industry, great and small, and provide
encouragement to the people best able
to judge the direction which innovation
should take and its prospects of com-
mercial success.
By these means we will successfully
stimulate domestic I.R. & D. Many will
share my view that such stimulation
could bring spectacular results in less
than a decade. Your Association has
urged the Government to give our rising
generation of scientists and technologists
the opportunity.
Our country has a great and exciting
future. I trust that your Association, by
drawing on the knowledge and ex-
perience of its members, will continue
to bring such matters to the attention of
the administration and the public.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Another Insurance Stock
APA Holdings seems very attractive
A pproximately ten months ago when
writing about the MLC I noted that
the immediate dividend yield of 2.2 p.c.
was “fairly meagre”. While the fall in
the price of the MLC’s shares which
has brought this yield up to 3.7 p.c. is
rather greater than for most other stocks,
the “insurance” stocks have been
marked down in general so that the
average yield is now about 34 p.c. from
the better-known insurance companies.
Today, the ordinary shares of APA
Holdings Ltd are selling at the lowest
level for four years. From a gross yield
point of view, the current price gives
the highest yield that has been available
since listing in March, 1958. The follow-
ing table indicates the maximum and
minimum yields which have been avail-
able from the shares since the beginning
of the 1959 calendar year:
1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Max. 2.5 3.7 4.3 4.0 2.9 4.0 4.3
Min. 1.8 3.2 3.8 2.9 2.0 3.1 3-7
Capital gains have been possible over
this period because the payout has been
increasing. Even the investor who
bought at the high price in 1962 of
112 s. 6d. could have sold at the low
price of 1964 and still made a capital
profit of 34 p.c. after brokerage both
ways. The investor who bought at 755.
in 1961 when the “dividend” yield was
4.3 p.c. would have made a capital profit
of 160 p.c. if he had been able to sell at
the top of the market in 1964.
The prospects of a recurrence of the
past history of price rises make an
appraisal of the future potential desirable
at the present time, for it seems fairly
clear that the capital appreciation could
be quite substantial.
APA Holdings was formed in iate
1957 to acquire all the shares of the
Australian Provincial Assurance Associa-
tion and the APA Fire and General In-
surance Company. The consideration
paid for these shares was rather novel,
since it provided that £2 of the £5 per
share consideration should be satisfied
by the issue of two £1 shares in APA
Holdings and the other £3 should take
the form of 30s. non-interest bearing
redeemable loan stock, which would be
attached to each of the £1 shares such
that the loan stock must be transferred
with the shares.
In July this year, this loan stock
will be fully repaid when the last half-
yearly payment is made. The company
has made a bonus issue of one-for-one
and the effect will be to maintain the
gross pay-out in the form of dividends.
While this means that shareholders’ in-
come will have increased by 137 p.c.
since 1959, it must be assumed that for
most of the private holders the new
arrangement will mean a considerable
reduction in net income, in that tax will
be payable on the full amount from
1965-66 onwards. Even so, net dividend
income would seem to have increased
by 24 p.c. since 1959 or at the annual
rate of 3 p.c. approximately.
In the chairman’s address printed in
the 1964 annual report, it is stated: “The
main asset of APA Holdings Ltd is
352,494 shares held in the Australian
Provincial Assurance Association Ltd”.
The dividend received by APA Holdings
from this main asset in 1963-64 would
have been about £193,872 over 93
p.c. of the total dividends received from
subsidiaries while in the previous year
the dividend from this subsidiary would
have represented about 84 p.c. of the
total. Over the last three years the
position would seem to be as follows:
Year to September 30 1962 1963 1964
£ £ £
Dividend from Asscc Assoc. 140,998 158 622 193,872
Dividend from other subsids. 59,218 30,610 14,908
As pointed out in my article on the
MLC Limited, there is nothing like a
well-established life assurance company
for the production of steadily increasing
profits. The position of the Life Depart-
ment of the Australian Provincial Assur-
ance Association can be illustrated by
a similar table to that produced in the
MLC article:
(£'000)
Year to Assurance Surplus of Surplus as
Sept. 30 Funds Life Dept. %of Funds
1961 9,484 .376 4.0
1962 10,358 456 4.4
1963 11,285 483 4.3
1964 12,195 520 4.3
Over the last seven years, the life
assurance funds of the APA seem to
have been increasing at the same annual
compound rate as those of the MLC, but
the percentage of surplus emerging has
been lower and, unfortunately, no clear
trend is apparent. The main difference
between the two companies seems to be
that, while the major portion of the
MLC’s profits arises from its life fund,
the major portion of 'he APA’s profits
arises from investments outside the fund.
In fact, it is only in the last two years
that any profits from the life fund have
been transferred to the shareholders, as
the following table shows:
Year fo (£'GOO)
Sept 30 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Invest income 87 89 95 96 99 115
Other income 3 12 40 1 0 21 31
Accident a c 18 21 30 30 30 25
Life a/c nil nii nsii nil 36 35
The investment income has been in-
creasing fairly steadily over this period
and there can be reasonable confidence
that this trend will continue. But the
other items have been too erratic to
suggest any trend. It will be interesting
to see whether or not the practice of
transferring life profits to the share-
holders will continue in the future.
The percentage that bonuses to policy-
holders has represented to the life assur-
ance fund has been virtually steady for
the last three years, though there have
been some other appropriations to the
life fund. In 1962 £50,000 was trans-
ferred to reserve for contingencies. In
1963 £45,000 was transferred to life
assurance contingency reserves and
£BOOO was appropriated as an additional
contribution to staff superannuation. In
1964 £50,000 was set aside as a special
provision to be used for the develop-
ment of the company’s insurance busi-
ness. A rough stab suggests that profits
available to the shareholders will in
future be equal to one p.c. of the life
fund less £50,000. This would, mean
that in ten years’ time when, at current
rates of growth the life fund should be
about £32 million, the profit and loss
account of the life assurance company
could look something like this:
£'ooo
Investment income 200
Other income 30
Accident a/c 30
Life a/c 270
Total: 530
On the basis of the practice of the
last few years, this would mean that
the life assurance company would pay
a dividend to APA Holdings of
£500,000. Even without any dividends
from other subsidiaries, this would per-
mit a dividend payment to shareholders
of 40 p.c. In other words, it is possible
for the dividend payout to increase at
an average annual compound rate of
nearly 94 p.c. per annum.
Unfortunately, I consider that this
is unlikely to happen. The profits which
may be transferred from the life fund
are much more likely to be limited to a
percentage of the annual surplus. If we
take 5 p.c. as a basis, our figure of
£530.000 would be reduced to about
£330,000 and the 40 p.c. dividend would
become about 25 p.c. This would slow
the rate of growth down to about 4} p.c.
This rate is still 50 p.c. better than
shareholders have experienced (net) since
1958.
At current prices, the shares seem
very attractive.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Not Very Weatherproof
Bramac keeps on battling
'C'rom its factories in Victoria and NSW,
Bramac Ltd manufactures a range
of weatherproof garments including rub-
ber, plastic and nylon. It also turns out
industrial rubber goods, concentrating
mainly on conveyor and transmission
belting. It has a strong affiliation with
Greengate and Irwell Rubber Co. Ltd of
Manchester, the largest manufacturer of
conveyor belting in the UK. This group
has given Bramac invaluable technicaT
assistance in the belting field and loaned
it many thousands of pounds over the
past few years. Today G. and I. holds
more than 60 p.c. of Bramac’s capital
and fills one of the four positions on the
board of directors.
Bramac was originally Bramall and
Co., registered in Melbourne in 1924.
The move to the stock exchange lists in
the late ’forties brought about the change
to the present name. Local and/or im-
port competition have made the ss.
shares a poor investment since listing.
The highest earning rate was 12.9 p.c.
in 1950-51 and the best dividend 8 p.c.
in the same year and 1953-54. Not
one issue has been made to shareholders.
The group has been on the brink of
permanent disaster several times but has
always just managed to scrape through.
From its low earnings, dividends of
between 5 p.c. and 8 p.c. were distribu-
ted every year from 1949-50 to 1956-7.
The payout was omitted in 1957-58 after
a £3OOO loss. The next two years saw 5
p.c. dividends, one narrowly covered,
one uncovered. The accompanying
table shows that no payout has been
made since the 5 p.c. of 1959-60.
During the 1961 calendar year,
balance date was changed from June 30
to December 31. For that full year to
June 30, profit equalled only 0.2 p.c. on
capital. In the ensuing six months to
December 31, a loss of £32,000 was
chalked up after lower sales. Recovery
came in 1962 and 1963, but earnings
were still horribly low at 0.9 p.c. and
0.4 p.c. respectively.
The latest 1964 year gave shareholders
their first ray of hope for some time.
A record £43,000 profit was made, re-
presenting 7.4 p.c. on capital, higher
at the end of the year. Many factors
appear to have helped this turning of
the corner. Not the least of these was
the managerial reorganisation of 1963.
This has brought about higher sales and
better performances in almost every
sphere of activity.
Overall sales rose by 9 p.c. Rainwear
turnover was slightly lower than 1963,
mainly because of the dry weather which
persisted in NSW. In the garment divi-
sion, increased customer acceptance and
improved production efficiency resulted
in higher profits. “Vee” rope sales ex-
panded. Turnover of conveyor belting
improved substantially and the division
saw a marked improvement in profits.
The result of last year’s Tariff Board
inquiry into conveyor belting was un-
favorable, necessitating the maintenance
of reduced selling prices to meet import
competition. The success of this acti-
vity, despite the lack of protection, was
attributable to two factor: first, the
volume and efficiency of production,
which enabled higher overall profits
although the profit margin on each

single item was low; second, imports
during the year were not substantial. To
a certain extent, the existence of the first
favorable condition depends on the
existence of the second, over which
Bramac, of course, has no control.
One example of the positive results of
the managerial reorganisation was the
purchase of a property in Sydney to
house the garment and industrial rubber
products under one roof. This is a
move which should have been made long
ago and greater efficiency combined with
the saving in costs should help to boost
profits again in 1965.
So far, the outlook for 1965 looks ex-
cellent as far as profits are concerned.
Sales in the March quarter were 12 p.c.
ahead of the same period last year. The
biggest increases have been made in the
industrial field. As payment for these
goods normally comes within 30 days
of the sale, the increase is especially re-
warding. At the recent annual meeting,
the chairman, Mr G. C. Tootell, told
shareholders that there was a definite
possibility for a dividend at the end of
the year.
If there is a dividend it will have to
be a small one. Last year it was omitted
because directors saw the need for
greater financial stability. This same
need will exist at the end of 1965, but
to a lesser extent. Moreover, tax will
take a bigger slice of profits this year.
If full liability is not incurred then it
almost certainly will be in 1966. So
directors may deem it unwise to pay a
dividend unless the rate can be main-
tained in ensuing years. Last year tax
took only £l5OO odd, £22,000 lower than
it would have been without the benefit of
past losses to bring forward.
It may well be that net profits this
year will show absolutely no increase
over 1964 after higher tax. In such a
case, another earning rate of 7.4 p.c.,
although low, would permit a dividend of
5 p.c. It must not be forgotten, though,
that profits could end up lower this
year if the pre-tax increase is not bigger
than the increase in the tax liability.
It seems ironic that the crutch which
has supported a crippled company over
the past few years has now stopped
supporting the group and is actually
crippling it to a certain extent. We refer
to G. and I. of the UK. Bramac has
been unable to pay back in cash the
extensive loans from its parent (in fact
the interest on some of the money was
waived at one stage because Bramac
could not even afford to pay that!). So
it has paid back a substantial part of the
loan by issuing shares. Hence the big
capital increase in 1964, shown in the
accompanying table.
If it were not for the capital increase,
1964 earnings would probably have been
high enough to pay a dividend and sta-

bilise the financial position to a certain
extent. The figure would have been
almost 10 p.c. At the very least, the
lack of a capital increase would have
ensured a dividend this year.
The accompanying table shows a
steady trend for current assets, the 1964
jump being due entirely to higher stock,
reflecting rising turnovers. Current lia-
bilities are low enough to leave the group
with plenty of working capital. The
1962 drop was due to a £200,000 loan
from G. and I. being converted to a
long-term loan. An extra £30,000 was
borrowed, bringing in loan capital at a
dangerously high level of £230.000 for
the first time that year. The issue of
590,000 ss. shares has reduced the loan
to £83,000-odd, repayable in December,
1970, and bearing interest at 6 p.c. a
year. The other £25,000 of the loan
capital, making £107,000 in all, was
raised through a mortgage loan.
Fixed assets have been steady, reflect-
ing the lack of expansion, but deprecia-
tion has risen because plant is working
harder now to meet rising demand. The
1964 profit gave the company a chance
to write off intangibles (establishment
costs) and catch up on accrued provi-
sions for long service leave. Despite the
bad years, reserves are slowly rising,
the dividend, yield shown for April, 1961
(a) reflects the 5 p.c. rate still applying
at that time after the 1959-60 payout.
Share prices, needless to say, have not
seen par for several years now.
To sum up: for speculators only at
the moment, on the strength of a divi-
dend. The shares could rise from the
present 3s. 6d. to par if a payout was
made. Then there is always the possi-
bility of a complete takeover by G. and I.
For the general investor, there are more
reliable stocks to put money in. The
threat of import competition still exists

and could knock the group rather badly
at any time. In addition, several good
years are needed now to ensure that the
present debts will be paid off satisfac-
torily. Still, if one likes to be kept on
one's toes, dividend yields expected this
year or in 1966 would give high returns
if the shares are bought below par and
one is ready to sell if the dividend looks
like being omitted again.

BEBARFALDS LTD
A Radical Reorganisation
Directors of Bebarfalds Ltd took a
radical step in 1962 when they de-
cided to diversify out of the company’s
traditional business of furniture retailing
into the general department store busi-
ness. Despite its initial apparent sue-
cess, the project contained the germs of
disaster which came to a climax only
two years later.
And despite statements by the board
as recently as the last annual meeting,
the decision has been taken to curtail
department store retailing in order to
revert to the home furniture business.
The present company came into being
in 1922, when it took over a business
which had been operating for more than
60 years. In the first 25 years to the end
of the Second World War, the company
had numerous ups and downs, it being
the end of 1938 before the effects of the
depression years were fully overcome.
Following the end of the war, the
company was able to resume ordinary
dividends for the first time in 17 years.
At the end of 1950, capital stood at
£900,000, including £lOO,OOO in pre-
ference shares, following a capital recon-
struction and bonus issue. The prefs
carry an entitlement to a cumulative
8 p.c. dividend.
Since then there have been two issues
to shareholders, both at par—a one-for-
eight in 1955 and a one-for-three in
1961. The 20s. ordinary shares were
split to ss. units in 1960. Present paid-
up ordinary capital is £1,200,000.
Profit reached a peak £183,148 in
1955, declined to £119,317 two years
later and then rose to £161,449 in 1960.
Dividend payments have followed a simi-
lar course. Following the credit squeeze,
earnings began to decline and directors,
in an attempt to diversify, decided to
enter the field of direct home selling.
This was attempted by a takeover offer
made for Hodgsons Holdings Ltd in
1961, but the company was outbid by
Waltons Ltd. The decision was then
made to build up its own home sales
division and at the same time, because
furniture retailing did not lend itself
easily to this activity, to establish a
general department store at the group’s
main building in the city,
An amount ot £20,000 was provided
for this purpose in 1962, accounting for
almost all the fall in profit from
£118,388, equal to 11.4 p.c. on capital,
to £99,391 (7.6 p.c.) in that year. Divi-
dend was cut from 9 p.c. to 6 p.c.
Initial effect of this new move was to
increase turnover. But the impact of
the change exceeded expectation. Costs
rose considerably, resulting in another
fall in profit this time to £84,336,
equal to 6.4 p.c. on capital and giving
a bare cover to the steady 6 p.c. dis-
tribution. Establishment and dislocation
costs totalling about £170,000 were
largely offset by a surplus of £161,230
arising from a change in accounting pro-
cedures regarding profits on instalment
sales.
The effect of the change appeared to
be basically successful, so that in 1963
the directors also changed the group’s
Parramatta store to a general department
store. The staff of collector-salesmen
was increased to more than 50.
Finance business increased rapidly
following the change and from a net
£1.5 million in 1962 rose rapidly to £2.6
million two years later. Following the
change in accounting procedure in 1962,
the amount of unearned income was
reduced from £448,230 in 1962 to
£278,491 the following year and last
year stood at £233,923.
Despite the growth in outstandings,
the provision for doubtful debts showed
only a minute movement in the two key
years of 1962 and 1963.
However, the reckoning came in 1964
when the board made a full review of
the group’s home sales debtors. Results
in the first half of the year indicated a
substantial increase in turnover, and an
interim dividend of 3 p.c. was paid.
Following the review, directors said that
the sales in the first half were inflated by
the rapid expansion of the home sales
division.
Budgeted sales and profits for the
second half of the year were not achieved
because of a decline in turnover in the
home furnishing divisions and the intro-
duction of more stringent controls m
the granting of credit in the home sales
division a gentle way of saying that
credit was apparently given almost in-
discriminately in the previous 18 months.
As a result, bad debts totalling £52,892
were written off during the year (making
£100,023 in the two years). The pro-
vision for doubtful debts was increased
by £103,844 to £132.162. In addition,
the group incurred a trading loss of
£67,691, resulting in a deficit for the
year of £228,382. No final ordinary
dividend was paid.
Because of the upset, the board has
decided on a further reorganisation.
Although no indication has yet been
given of what form it is likely to take,
directors have on several occasions
declared their faith in a “properly
organised and controlled home sales
operation”. They have also indicated
that they have considered curtailing the
group’s traditional home furnishing
business. Closing down some of the 13
stores in which it operates could also
be on the cards, although most operate
from freeholds.
But thinking along these lines has
lately taken a dramatic change, for the
main store at the corner of Park and
George Streets, Sydney, is now on the
market, with directors hoping to lease
back several of the floors from the
prospective buyer.

Terms of the sale will obviously have
a vital effect on future plans for the
company, though department store retail-
ing will certainly play little if any part
of future operations.
Nevertheless, the move cannot be
long delayed, for, despite buoyant retail
trading figures for New South Wales in
the six months to December, the group
incurred a loss of about £lOO,OOO in the
period and directors decided not to pay
an interim dividend on the preference
shares.
The company’s financial position
showed a sharp decline in the 12 months
to June last, although based on book
values the ss. shares still had an assets
backing of Bs. Bd. a share. Overdraft at
£795,515 is more than twice the £378,714
of two years earlier, yet not much larger
than the 1963 figure of £753,829.
Trust deed limitations curtailed the
raising of additional funds by note issues,
so in a major refinancing move the
board arranged a short-term private loan
of £1.2 million and a longer-term loan
of £480,000 maturing between 1969 and
1973. Any scheme of reorganisation will
almost certainly hinge on the repayment
or extension of the £1.2 million. A note
to the last accounts shows that the com-
pany faced the repayment of £2,815,777
within the next two years, while amounts
payable to the company totalled only
£2,318,576.
Since the interim report, the shares
have been languishing around 2s. The
company obviously has a long, hard
road to negotiate before it can regain
its standing of several years ago. At
these price, levels, the shares obviously
have speculative interest. Even in the
event of a winding up, the shareholders
would obviously, receive more than the
current market value. The shares appear
well worth locking away.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
Buying on Some Bad News
The rule applied to MLC
/An the day it was announced that H. G.
Palmer was in the red for four
million pounds, a large advertisement
appeared stating that a “credit manager
will shortly be available”!
Credit control must be about the most
difficult task in the commercial world.
H. G. Palmer appeared to have escaped
the pitfalls that so many of the other
retailers and financiers had fallen into.
As it turned out, they were just a little
slower in discovering them. This loss of
four million pounds wipes out the pre-
tax profits for the last six years. The
loss would have been so much the
greater if H. G. Palmer had not had the
benefit of lower borrowing rates follow-
ing its takeover by the MLC in 1963.
In contrast to Palmer’s latest per-
formance, the parent MLC Ltd showed
an increase in profits of almost 30 p.c.
While the debts debacle must be a blow
to the MLC company, with its vast re-
sources it should be well able to absorb
the shock.
When the MLC was moved from the
unofficial stock exchange list to the
official list in 1962, the company under-
went a severe form of analysis by several
brokers and in most cases came out
with top marks. Since then the share
price, which was then close to the £8
mark, has been almost halved. One
conclusion is that you can now buy
almost twice as many MLC shares as
you could buy a few years ago.
Apart from this arithmetical fact, I
do think the rule of buying on bad news
holds good here. The fall of an additional
7s. to 845., on the announcement, after
the shares had already fallen 30s. this
year, was just unnecessary panic. In
went my order for 100 shares.
No progressive business or industry
can continue for ever without some un-
expected tests for management. With
record crops and a soaring world price,
the sugar industry was at its most
buoyant level in 1963. Hardly a year
later the pendulum had swung to the
other extreme. Not only had the world
price of sugar dropped from over £lOO
to £25, but Mother Nature had also
turned sulky in 1964.
One would thus expect a collapse in
the profits of the sugar millers in 1964,
and one would have been right if the
sugar miller under review was Gibson
and Howes or Pioneer Sugar. But Fairy-
mead proved quite a different story.
Stated profits fell only £lO,OOO to
£426,000 in the 1964 year. As a result
the share price has held steady at 245.
How the company achieved such a
steady result is difficult to understand.
Profits in the previous year appeared to
have been conservatively stated, so per-
haps the 1964 year benefited accordingly.
This year’s result will probably reflect
a more realistic position. The chairman
may even be good enough to tell us the
immediate outlook for the company at
the annual general meeting on Monday.
Working on the assumption that it’s a
tale of woe, I shorted 200 shares at 245.
The last transaction for the week was
the purchase of 200 Mauri Bros at
16s. 6d. Throughout the years I have
extolled the virtues of this company, in
particular its habit of bonus issues every
four years. Last year proved no excep-
tion, with a l-for-4 bonus issue being
made in October. At the same time, an
excellent 20 p.c. increase in profits was
announced. Now under the pressure of
the slogan ‘‘Yield is way out, man”, the
shares have slipped from 20s. 9d. to
just on 16s.
On the other side of the account was
the sale of 500 ICIANZ rights at 14s. 6d.
The sharp rise on Thursday seemed too
precious to miss, especially as it meant
a £42 profit.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
500 ICIANZ rts, 14/6 £356
200 Fairymead Sugar, 24/- £235
BOUGHT
100 MLC, 84/- £427

A glance at the present portfolio is
enough to disclose my interest in tin.

the share prices, there’s been another

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Section 92 and Marketing
Primary producers seek amendments
fpHE move by some primary producer
groups to press for an amendment
to Section 92 of the Constitution is now
becoming a little clearer. But not that
much clearer. There is still a feeling
amongst some observers that the whole
thing is a “Dorothy Dixer' 5 the brain-
wave of some of the members of the
Federal Government, if not the Govern-
ment as a whole. Encouraging the poli-
ticians are the “faceless planners' 5 .
So far most of the producer organisa-
tions have been a little wary of the
proposal, not necessarily because they
disapprove of it, but because they have
more pressing matters in front of them.
Now the National Farmers’ Union has
agreed at least to consider a recom-
mendation from the Australian Wheat-
growers’ Federation (one of the impor-
tant organisations affiliated with the
NFU) that it press for inclusion of the
Section 92 amendment proposal in the
referendum, likely towards the end of
the year, to decide if the House of Repre-
sentatives will be enlarged. The NFU
may or may not go along with the re-
commendation from the Wheatgrowers’
Federation.
The chances are that it could. NFU
president A. F. Flavard has issued a state-
ment in which he lists the various objec-
tions to Section 92. These are that it
prevents the proper working of State
marketing boards for primary produce.
Interstate sales, he says, have been a well-
known way of reducing the effectiveness
of marketing boards in such commodities
as eggs, barley and dried fruits.
A case can be argued along this line.
At the same time, however, it does ap-
pear that too many primary producers
may be misleading themselves in attribut-
ing all the ills of marketing to Section 92.
It is a handy scapegoat for bungling with-
in the marketing boards themselves. It
also provides checks and balances which
a true democracy must have even if
they are annoying to the planners.
The wheatgrowers who are advocating
amendment of Section 92 are not really
concerned with the movement of wheat.
It is barley they are worried about and
there are, indeed, many wheatgrowers
who also grow barley. There is an Aus-
tralian Barley Board, though it does not
function in all States, and there is a
considerable direct trade between barley
merchants and the maltsters.
As for egg producers and dried fruit
growers, no one could deny that their
industries face marketing troubles. Yet
there is no guarantee that removal of
Section 92, and a strengthening of the
powers of the marketing boards, is the
most effective, or the cheapest, method
of improving marketing.
A far bigger threat to marketing, from
the producers’ end, is vertical integration.
In a sense vertical integration is just a
flash way of describing monopoly the
production, conveyance and distribution
of a primary product under the control of
one hand from earth to mouth, so to
speak. It is not new.
There have been two notable industries
in Australia with their share of vertical
integration meat and brewing. And it
is perhaps not merely by coincidence that
the two biggest fortunes in Australia were
Angliss (meat) and Resch (brewing).
Sir William Angliss owned stations which
reared the cattle and sheep, slaughter-
houses, and butcher’s shops. In brewing
the pattern is perhaps even more marked,
with ownership, or very tight control, of
hop fields, breweries, malt houses, and
hotels.
Compared with the new type of verti-
cal integration these are fairly unsophisti-
cated operations. In any case it has not
always been as profitable as popularly

imagined. Sir William Angliss was prone
to remark that his own properties cost
him money and that the best place to buy
on the hoof was Newmarket, Melbourne,
which he described as the best market in
the world because of the strength of the
competition.
But then the only computer he had
was the one in his head. It is computers
which are going to make vertical integra-
tion the biggest thing in agriculture in
the next few years. Primary producers, in
general, seem unaware of it. The beauty
of the computer is that it can give a very
accurate forecast of market requirements
ahead. This eliminates one of the most
costly aspects of marketing any primary
product. With a computer, and vertical
integration, gluts and shortages can be
avoided. Production can be adjusted so
that the exact quantity reaches the market
at the right time just like motor cars
or shoes.
Certainly there is an element of theory
in this. It has yet to be proved that the
computer is infallible. Going on US
experience, one should not count on it
being wrong.
The best example of vertical integra-
tion in Australia at present is the frozen
chicken industry. It has made giant steps
in the space of a few short years and
will do even better once computers are
used more often. The operations are
likely to get bigger. Farmers will supply
on contract to the firms which prepare
the chickens and distribute them. In-
creasingly these firms will see the ad-
vantages of distributing through their
own, or tied, outlets.
Frozen peas and beans are the next
best example at present. The time may
not be far off when other fruits and vege-
tables will be handled in the same
manner. The shortcomings of existing
fruit and vegetable marts are too well
known to need elaboration. They are
wide open for a bypassing movement.
Meat, and now we are getting into the
silk department, is in the throes of
change already. The butcher versus the
supermarket is not any prelim, bout; both
antagonists are still very strong. It is
interesting to note that the biggest chain
and supermarket empire of all, Wool-
worths, is currently advertising for a
“meat controller” who is required, so the
ad. goes, “to control the complete Austra-
lia-wide meat marketing operations for
Woolworths Ltd with more than 400 food
outlets in all States and considerable ex-
pansion planned”.
The likely impact of vertical integra-
tion in this country is one of those things
which should not be regarded as a de-
liberate plot emanating from evil minds.
To do this is to miss the point of it all.
It will happen inevitably and this is not
guesswork; it is not support for the prin-
ciple of it, either. It is merely facing the
facts.
The facts are that, in the years to
come, the only way young men will be
able to go on the land, and many will
want to, will be to enter into a con-
tractual arrangement with a vertical in-
tegrator, who will provide the capital.
Land is simply too dear for the great
majority of young men. Because of high
land prices, £40,000 will not get you
much of a property these days.
It does not matter where or what kind
of property: it is all relative. Unless
you inherit it you cannot get much better
than 3-k p.c. on capital invested in a
farming property. So why invest it even if
you have it? (This applies to a going pro-
perty, not one to be developed for tax
benefits. A young family man needs a
going property.) Who can afford that
money? Only the sons of rich men or the
sons of big Anyone else hasn’t
a chance.
These land prices are inflated, of
course. And one of the major causes of
the inflated farm prices is the very system
of marketing boards which guarantee the
prices for the produce from the farms.
Vertical integration could be a good
thing or a bad thing depending on how
quickly, and expertly, producers come to
terms with it. This is where the CEMA
egg plan, to belabor a point perhaps, is
so full of intrigue. It is, and very much
so, an attempt to circumvent Section 92.
Some, but not all, egg producers applaud
this.
Yet those small egg producers who
believe that everything will be perfect
after CEMA comes into operation must
inevitably be disappointed. Eggs are a
natural for vertical integration. This
will go on despite CEMA. Mammoth
enterprises, with half a million birds, are
already being planned and those small
farmers will find they are unable to
compete.
Young men, graduates many of them,
will get good jobs with these mammoth
concerns. Others, on contract farming,
will supply them with chicks, or grain or
green feed. It will not be as nice as
having the old man give you a sheep sta-
tion, but it will be a way of breaking in.
In short time the redundant factor may
be the marketing boards themselves. Per-
haps that is why, in the CEMA case, the
planners have been so anxious to get a
watertight act through Parliament without
giving their opponents a hearing.
Minimising the Drought
Transport reform called for
T>y now it is obvious that the drought
is likely to be long-term. Drought
cycles nearly always have been in the
past and a good part of the country ap-
pears to be in for it again.
Many men are suggesting ways the
effects can be minimised, and this is
good. Water, obviously, is a prime
requisite. Fodder conservation is another.
Yet these are. not simple matters.
Should the Government, for example,
provide funds for farmers to sink more
dams? If so, should the man who has
never bothered to improve his property
get a new dam or should it go to the man
who has already spent thousands of
pounds and-is relatively better off?
If you conserve fodder, how long do
you conserve it? It will not last 20 years,
or even 10, and be much good. Might
it not be better to conserve no fodder at
all but to use up the grass in the good
years and take the losses in the. bad?
There is one requisite which needs at-
tention and which would help greatly
in the present drought situation. More-
over, it is a quite feasible thing. This is
transport.

There is a classic method of making
money in a drought and this is to book
up rail trucks in advance. The man who
can command rail trucks for his use in
a drought can always do well. There are
always parts of the country which escape
the main impact of drought. There are
agistment paddocks available and fodder
to be had if you can get the stock to
the agistment paddocks or the fodder to
the stock.
Road transport, because of the cost
involved, is not the answer, unfortu-
nately. You could buy a semi-trailer load
of sheep in western NSW right now for
five shillings or less a head. By the time
you got them to agistment or a market
you would have spent more than they
were worth on fuel. For stud-stock road
transport pays, but not for the general
run of livestock.
There are, at the time of writing,
literally thousands of tons of hay stacked
at sidings in Victoria waiting for rail
trucks to take it to NSW. This is hay
which is under firm order, if it can be
got to the drought areas. The railways
are unable to provide trucks. Both the
NSW and the Victorian railways have
the same problem.
“In the economic sense Australia is
an experiment in transportation.” A
well-known enough quotation. The ex-
periment could stand rejuvenation.

We spent ten wonderful days in India’s tropical South. So much to see and
do there . . . we’re going back this year. We called first at MADRAS, a fine
old seaport city, with stylish hotels in the Grand Manner. We went to a festival
of the most superb Indian classical music and dancing—such beautiful women!
Then along miles of glistening beaches to MAHABALIPURAM and the world-
famous shore temples, where ancient sculptors carved countless gods and
goddesses, warrior kings, chariots, elephants —into masses of solid rock along
the water’s edge. Everywhere you go in the South, you see bizarre and beautiful
sculpture, immensely old temples and roadside shrines.

Lights in MYSORE. So we cheered the great parade as the
Maharajah went by in his golden howdah atop his favourite
painted elephant. No parade will ever seem the same after
that. Then elegant BANGALORE, with its high mountain
air, tree-lined streets, gardens and splendid buildings. We saw
elephants, tigers, bison and boar and many other wild animals
in PERIYAR Game Sanctuary. We decided to take the boat
along miles of waterways, through sleepy villages and tropical*
countryside, to old COCHIN. What a hotch-potch of
architecture this historic seaport is: Dutch, Portuguese, British
. . . and heaven knows how many Indian styles, all adding
to the charm of the place. That evening, we sipped long
drinks on the hotel terrace. Across the lawn was the Arabian
Sea. Palm trees stirred in the sea breeze. Dolphins splashed
in the waves. Further South, we were enchanted by the
tropical beauty of palm-fringed KOVAL AM Beach, near
historically beautiful TRIVANDRUM. See why we want to
go back? Oh, by the way, the bargains we found—saris in
Madras, ivory in Cochin . . . fine handcrafts everywhere.
India’s a holidayland of endless variety and surprise. It’s all
there: ancient temples, vigorous modernity, colour, spectacle.
Luxury living in fine hotels. Comfortable travel in air-
conditioned trains, Caravelle jetplanes, and above all, the
heart-warming friendliness and hospitality of the Indian people.
