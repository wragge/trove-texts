PRAWNS BY THE MILLION
When Mrs. Anne von Bertouch
called at “The Bulletin” office a week
or two ago I thought —with a name
like that; and since she said she and
her husband were trying to hack a
farm out of the scrub somewhere near
Newcastle, N. S. Wales —that she was
sure to be a New Australian. But I
see from the dustjacket of her
February Dark (Constable) that she
was born in Sydney and her husband
(of Danish descent) in Tasmania; and
that both used to be schoolteachers
and gave that up to grow fruit “on
the shores of Myall Lake, 80 miles
north-west of Newcastle.”
So she is not New but Old. Not
that it makes any difference. But she
is new to writing; and “February
Dark” is the solidest, wettest, greenest,
saltiest, fishiest, most authentically
Australian slab of Australian writing
I have had the pleasure of reading for
many a long day. Purporting to be
a novel, it is about a young married
couple called the Rokebys who, just
as the von Bertouches themselves did,
gave up schoolteaching to make a
living on a stony, sub-tropical hill
beside a lake north of Newcastle.
I must confess I chiefly like it
because it is about prawns, a noble and
mysterious fruit which appears as if
by magic in Sydney fish-shops, glowing
like a rosy sunset even in the dark
caverns of Wynyard Station —like a
dawn of prawns, I should say—without
any of us knowing where they come
from or how they get there. They were
immortalised by Tom Roberts in one
of the most exquisite of his paintings;
they are a superb decoration for beer;
and personally I have had the greatest
curiosity about them ever since, on
a holiday down the South Coast —far
from Mrs. von Bertouch’s haunts, and
a far more amateur style of prawning
than she describes—l watched the
prawners tramp through the shallow
lakes by night, turning that scrubby
wilderness into a fairyland of bonfires
and moving lanterns.
Here, then, is Mrs. von Bertouch’s
first glimpse of the prawns in her
northern lake, glowing in her prose as
in the Roberts painting—though
Roberts’s were cooked:—
“There should be something show-
ing now.” Peter picked up the
bubble and gathered the net in his
nibbling fingers. As his hands circled
the flue there was a rushing, crackling
sound, and over the boat a thousand
red eyes could be seen, glowing hot
as embers in the lamplight and
sliding in almost transparent bodies
down the slapping tail of the net
as he thrashed it firmly on the
water.
But it would be unfair to “February
Dark” to suggest that its appeal is
limited to admirers of the prawn. If
you stay with it—and you need to be
a sticker, because it contains about
twice as many words as it needs to,
and Mrs. von Bertouch is absolutely
merciless in her reportage, never
omitting the slightest detail in describ-
ing anything from the unloading of a
barge to the making of a curiy—it is
a very good book from all sorts of
angles.
It is good, in the first place, simply
as a book about the scenery. The lake
and the river are alive in it. It smells
of water and fish:—
The morning air flowed about
them as they walked, cold and crisp
as the sea, bringing with it the tang
of oysters, the taste of salt, the smell
of bait and the restlessness of the
tidal river. Out in midstream a
porpoise slid its grey fish-body up
and over along the current in long,
slow snorting loops. Nearby a shag
plunged with a smack, leaving drift-
ing ovals on the surface of the
water. Beneath the store-wharf
seagulls haggled over a piece of gut,
and underneath, in the half-dark, a
cat slid from clump to clump of
weed, its eyes fixed unwinking on
something that scurried and was
still.
It is good just as a book about the
weather. When it rains up there it
rains, as good Australian rain should,
by the bucketful. When it is hot —
and it is astonishing how many Aus-
tralian books fail to get the proper
feeling of heat —it really is hot: —
At Bukkiana the air burned clear
and then jelled to a rising heat-haze,
the water shimmered, the earth was
hot on the root, the rock hot under
the lizard’s belly, the flank of the
banana-palm warm as flesh to the
touch. No factory-fumes hung be-
tween man and his lord the sun,
but there was a smell of smoke in
the air, wood-smoke, clean and
sweet. Away towards Bambara a
white fern rose to a great height,
. then drifted on the upper breeze
from the north. Near the coast,
towards Seal Rocks, another fern
grew in a vertical column, rose high,
then drifted south to mingle with
the heat-haze.
It is good—though Mrs. von Ber-
touch has been too busy with' other
things to go in much for detailed obser-
vation—on the birds, snakes, ants,
insects and animals that share with
these modern pioneers this fierce, lush,
harsh, delectable country: the kanga-
roos and the fireflies, the huge eels
and the strange, spiky, poisonous fish
that get into the net with the
prawns, the dingoes that howled by
night, the carpet-snake and the
possum, the flying - squirrel, the
satin-bowerbirds that developed a
passion for the tomatoes, the half-tame
currawong that got a tick in its nose
and could not be caught to be saved
but eventually managed to dig the thing
out itself.
It is good, for those who prefer the
tomato to the prawn, or those who
think of making a fortune by growing
this unpredictable vegetable, on how
to dig a tomato-farm on a stony hill-
side, and how to fence the crop in
from the kangaroos and the bower-
birds, and how to console yourself
when the price drops so much that
you lose about five-shillings a case
when you send them to market, and
what to say, in decent, printable Eng-
lish, when, the moment you have dug
the crop in and pulled out the plants
to grow beans instead, there are floods
somewhere else up the. countiy and the
price goes up to the sky.
It is good as the practical working-
out of every city-dweller’s . dream of
escape. “You and I are the funnies,”
says the husband somewhere, meaning
that they are outside life, caricatures;
but that is not quite right, for they
are the sort of “funnies” that all
writers, at least, and no doubt all
schoolteachers, and very likely every-
body else who isn’t hopelessly sold to
urban life, dream of becoming. You
chuck it all up; you grow tomatoes or
stud-stock or prawns; and then you
have time for what Mrs. von Bertouch,
in one of the moments when she
flutters her wings, a little uncomfort-
ably calls “creative living.” It is, of

STILL CONFIDENT
ttAROLD HOLT’S first Budget-
speech shows Federal expendi-
ture to be still in full blast, and the
Budget figures indicate expectations
of a buoyant economy in 1959-60.
The Opposition may criticise the
arid absence of notable changes calcu-
lated to free commerce of some of its
shackles. And it will no doubt have a
good deal to say about the changes in
post-office charges which will make
the letter-rate the highest in the world,
but only from the point of view of
the public, and not from that of busi-
ness, which, on commercial postages,
will be hardest hit. But the rest of the
alterations provide Dr. Evatt and
friends with little of their particular
type of ammunition.
Even the pensions provisions give
them little scope for their mock
indignation.
Generally speaking, the Budget is
one for the individual voter. Except for
the liberalising of retention allowances
in respect of the distributions of private
companies (a welcome and overdue
provision), and of depreciation provi-
sions applying to mining companies
and concessions to oil-exploration
enterprises, the whole plan for the
coming year suggests that the economy
is running on oiled wheels, braked
just to the right degree; that it needs
no relief from handicaps through the
taking-off of such excrescences as the
payroll-tax.
Mr. Holt noted the upswing in pro-
duction and trade among our overseas
customers, and in local conditions the
high employment-rate and strongly
running investment tending to promote
consumption-expenditure. But he also
stressed the need to keep-up with a
rate of expansion which had increased
population by over two-million in a
decade —925,000 from net migration—
and added, 750,000 houses and
1,440,000 motor-vehicles to the
national possessions.
With big strides in every kind of
industry, accorfipanied by great and
increasing diversification, he looks for-
ward to even greater advances in the
next decade accelerated by the
wiping-out of the shortages which
hampered growth at the beginning of
the 10 years just completed; also, to
the growth of the labor-force, better
equipped for a higher and cheaper
rate of productivity when allied to
modern techniques.
r T'HE only crucial difficulty, he seems
to believe, will involve “the same
problems as in the past of keeping-up
an adequate momentum of growth
without trying to run faster than our
legs will carry us, and of securing full
employment of resources and the most
efficient distribution of resources.”
To provide the right expansion in
the work-force the Government pro-
poses to continue its policy of keeping
the average net inflow from immigra-
tion at about one per cent, per annum
of the population—though it has fallen-
off somewhat in the recent past —and
to keep a close eye on the quota from
year to year.
To keep resources fully employed
in keeping with rising population, it
recognises the importance of public-
works schemes such as road-develop-
ment in conjunction with the States
and local authorities, water-supply,
land - improvement and kindred
projects.
These are simple matters; but the
Treasury view on overall production
programmes is much more compli-
cated. It believes the main task of
production belongs to industry, with
public authorities providing basic
facilities and services, the demand for
which is “necessarily very strong,”
though the provision of them “must
not be pushed ahead too fast,” since,
if it is, “the cost will fall back on the
community in the form of higher
taxes.” It “is important to keep the
burden of taxes down to a minimum,”
while at the same time promoting a
“condition of progress combined with
stability.”
The Treasurer’s measures seem to
form a peculiarly political combination
of sweeteners for “the individual
citizen” on whose placation and satis-
faction he sets so much store, combined
with other measures which tend to take
away with the left hand what has been
given with the right.
A shilling in the £ is taken-off
income-tax all round, which is some-
thing to be thankful for and should
increase incentives without producing
inflation.
Pensions are increased 7s. 6d. a
week, the means-test is eased to allow
pensioners and their wives a little more
leeway in enjoying the results of thrift.
Medical benefits will double the
payment for major operations, with a
slight increase in the fund rates.
Hospital benefits are widened in ambit.
But pharmaceutical benefits are
reformed to place a ss. charge on
prescriptions for life-saving drugs
which have been handed-out like dirt,
increasing fivefold since 1952-53 until
the total cost works out at 325. 6d.
per head of population. All other
prescriptions will cost patients a maxi-
mum of ss.—which should be a big
saving to patients.
Since roughly a fifth of the avail-
able cash revenue of the Common-
wealth now goes to the National
Welfare Fund, and the amount is rising
at the rate of about 12 per cent, a
year with the increase of population
and in the limits of the expectation of
life, more could scarcely be expected.
What is to be expected is that while
the public gets concessions, section-
ally or otherwise, they will come out
of its own pocket in the ultimate. The
Consolidated Revenue collection of
round £l3 million before World War
I has turned into something a thous-
and times more demanding —-this
almost literally, since taxation this year
is estimated as likely to add-up to
£1,204,000,000.
of the hungriest mouths that
has to be fed is that of the Post
Office, which has called for an invest-
ment of £4OO million on buildings alone
since 1945, with the demand “continu-
ing to grow,” along with the basic
wage, which has added no less than £22
million to the G.P.O. wages-bill since
1951. This year, Mr. Holt having given
the public back £25 million in tax-
concessions in the general field, the
Post Office will take back £17.8 million
in the shape of postal increases and
new telephone and telegraph charges.
In sum, nobody has got anything
much in his hot little hand from the
Budget except the pensioners, whose
rises accord proportionately with those
of the basic wage.
However, the desert of nothingness
which lies below the hypothetical head-
ing of direct encouragement to business
and industry and investment may be
accounted for by the fact that a com-
mittee of inquiry 'is to be set-up in
accordance with the promise given by
the Prime Minister in his policy-speech
to make a “competent and independent
investigation of the taxation laws.”
Altogether, the Budget, based on a
policy of deficit-financing—though a
mild one, since the cash deficit is fore-
cast at £6l million —is one not inap-
propriate to a growing economy with a
lively investment market, plenty of
loan-money behind it for the moment,
and full employment. But it is not par-
ticularly imaginative, and certainly not
a direct stimulus to industrial expan-
sion.


PEERS OF THE PENSION
“My word, Harold, so long as you no bin primitive or nomadic plurry aborigine, you have my-feller pension, I have yours!”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Post Office
The increase in postal and telephone
charges involves one of the most eco-
nomically damaging moves made by the
Menzies Government, and is illustrative
of a Canberra attitude of passing the
buck of its own inefficiency to private
industry. Postage in Australia will
become the highest in the world.
Even in the United States, where costs
of most things, along with wages, are
much higher than here, the rate for
first-class mail is three cents an ounce,
or round 3jd. Australian. Letters
collectable at offices where there are no
local deliveries cost only two cents an
ounce, and other rates are in proportion.
The United Kingdom first-class rate is
3d. sterling an ounce.
The Australian Post Office may seem
to Mr. Holt “a highly competent
organisation—efficiently managed, de-
voted to the service of the public, pro-
gressive in outlook, eager to meet the
ever-increasing demands upon it for
wider and better facilities,” and to be
credited with “notable success” in its
fields. But, then, Mr. Holt probably
has never read the Sydney newspapers
carrying the constant threats of the
Postal Workers’ Union, which seems
to have as much to do with post-office
management as the directors and other
senior officials.
He has never had to beg and cajole
the Telephone Department to install a
telephone in the home of a bad heart
case, finding it almost impossible until he
discovers that he knows the right man.
He has never, either, one should imagine,
gone without a telephone while conscious
that the illegal s.-p. bookie next-door has
a large battery of them which he uses
for breaking the law.
The G.P.O. is seeking “larger and
larger amounts of money for capital-
expenditure” because it has been out-of-
date in many respects, and a travelled
Australian population is not prepared to
accept the system which has prevailed
here in both postal and telephone
services.
Since the war the “Government” —-
that is, the taxpayers —have provided
£4OO million for new buildings and
equipment and the “demand continues
to grow.” But instead of bringing them
cheaper postal services, this capital-
expenditure out of revenue has resulted
in still-heavier charges.
It transpires, moreover, that although
the G.P.O. has been held up by the
Government as an organisation run on
business lines, it does not even know
what its invested capital is. As Mr.
Holt admits: “There is room for differ-
ence of opinion as to what true capitalisa-
tion of the Post Office should be.”
Furthermore, the Postmaster-General,
though technically a responsible Minis-
ter of the Crown, has little influence over
the running of the concern since one of
his first Ministerial acts on taking office
is to sign away most of his rights to the
Director-General, on the excuse that the
business is so enormous that no Minister
could take the decisions that are neces-
sary without having been a lifetime on
the job.
So the Government has decided to get
“the best outside advice on the capital
question and on other outstanding ques-
tions” from a “committee of competent
outside people,” who will enable the
Government to “review the whole ques-
tion of Post Office finances.”
How the need to do this squares with
Mr. Holt’s assurance that the G.P.O. is
itself a “highly competent organisation”
he did not explain in his Budget. Any-
one who has seen a telephone installed
has usually seen the ultimate in unco-
ordinated manpower and time-wasting.
More time seems to be spent in making
tea than on the job. And anyone in
business who depended on letters posted
in Canberra on Saturday being
delivered to a Sydney G.P.O. box by
8 a.m. on Monday morning would soon
go broke.
Pity the Princess !
Pity the poor Princess Alexandra, if her
first half-hour in Australia is a sample
of what she is going to encounter in her
six weeks’ tour of Australia!
While some formality and protocol is
essential, is it really necessary for a 22-
year-old girl, full of fun and vivacious-
ness, to have to shake-hands with 27
politicians, and, in most cases, their wives,
the minute she arrives in Australia?
That is what Princess Alexandra was
faced with when she stepped from the
Qantas Constellation which brought her
to Canberra last Friday.
Could the welcoming-party not have
been limited to the vice-regal party, the
Prime Minister and his wife, and the
Opposition-leader and his wife?
Conceivably there must be future
occasions, less formal, when the whole
of the Ministry, and their wives, if they
want to, can meet the Princess and shake
her hand.
They certainly got the opportunity at
the State Ball on Monday night.
It must be carrying protocol too far
when Parliamentary secretaries and their
wives have to be introduced at the airport.
It seems that despite the Government’s
good intention of an informal “youth-
accented” tour, politicians have put on the
pressure to be included in everything
that’s going on.
The same thing appears to have
happened in the State organisations, where
the list of functions reads like the itinerary
of a visiting mayor, going from civic
reception to civic reception, shaking
hands with the mayor and his wife, and
all his side-kicks as well.
Officialdom will have no one except
itself to blame if the young Princess gets
a bit fed-up and pleads fatigue to avoid
some of the unbearably official functions.
And they, too, will have to bear the
brunt of the blame if, on her return
home, Princess Alex reports she finds Aus-
tralians a stuffy, formal mob, who seek
every occasion, big and small, to lime-
light their politicans and de facto civic
leaders.
New Rural Airliner
Last Wednesday afternoon, at Tamworth
(N.S.W.) airport, East-West Airlines
took delivery of its first Fokker Friend-
ship prop.-jet airliner. Standing on the
tarmac, after a 12-day delivery-flight
from Amsterdam (Holland), and sil-
houetted in the sunshine against, in the
background, the city of Tamworth and
blue hills beyond, the Friendship was an
attractive sight, and symbolic of the
progress of E.-W.A. since its incorpora-
tion in 1947 and of the growth of rural
Australia.
The Friendship is the first prop.-jet
introduced by E.-W.A., or, for that
matter, any local-service airline in Aus-
tralia. A second Fokker Friendship will
be delivered to the co. in -July, 1960. It
is scheduled to begin operations over
sectors of the co.’s two-State network
of 25 airports on August 24. It has a
seating-capacity for 40 passengers and
is powered by two Rolls-Royce Dart
prop.-jet engines giving it a cruising
speed of 270 m.p.h.
E.-W.A. is the only independent airline
operating in the eastern half of Aus-
tralia, and aims primarily to meet the
needs of the rural areas. By a policy of
decentralisation, by serving country dis-
tricts as well as metropolitan, E.-W.A.
can and does make a valuable contri-
bution to the development of Australia’s
outback.
Airports which will receive regular
Friendship service will be: Sydney,
Brisbane, Tamworth, Cowra, Coolan-
gatta, Armidale and Inverell. Grafton
will be added in November.
The Fight Is On
[From Canberra]
Postmaster-General Davidson has
“taken-on” the powerful metropolitan
television-stations in the battle for control
of country TV, licences for which will
be issued shortly.
In a blunt statement to Parliament he
accused city interests of peddling the
story that there wasn’t enough capital in
country areas to operate rural TV
efficiently.
He also warned them that if they
banded together to try and “corner” the
programme-supply and withhold it from
future country stations unless they got a
share of the control, the Government
would step in and protect the interests
of rural TV.
Davidson dealt with three arguments
he claimed city TV-interests were
pushing.
These were (1) that there was insuffi-
cient capital; (2) that programmes
wouldn’t be available ; (3) that local talent
in country areas could not put up per-
formances of the standard (yes,
standard /) of city programmes.
The first he demolished by saying that
it would cost only between £300,000 and


Coinciding with the visit of Princess
Alexandra to Queensland on the occasion
of the State’s Centenary celebrations, next
week’s issue of The Bulletin will be an
enlarged number presenting a pageant, in
black-and-white art, prose and verse, of
life in Queensland over the past century.
In this galaxy of talent Queensland
authors will be featured. Rachel Henning
writes from Exmoor station, near Bowen,
in 1863; and the following years are repre-
sented by stories from Louis Becke,
Ernest Favenc, “Steele Rudd,” lon Idriess,
Randolph Bedford, Vance Palmer and
others.
“Banjo” Paterson and other poets write
about Queensland; and the black-and-
white art depicts life not only in Queens-
land, but is often a picture of life in
Australia generally over the period.
The entire issue of The Bulletin next
week will enter into the spirit of Queens-
land’s Centenary celebrations, and will be
a historic memento of the occasion.

agent. Price, as usual, One Shilling.
£400,000 to establish a country TV-
station, and there was that kind of money
in the areas in which TV was to be estab-
lished.
Then came his warning that the Gov-
ernment would step in if programmes
weren’t freely available to country
stations.
On the third point he claimed that
country talent was equal to anything the
cities provided, and, judging by some of
the “live” shows on city TV, such talent
would not be hard to beat.
“These arguments being put forward
by the commercial TV-interests in our
capital-cities just won’t stand up to exam-
ination,” Davidson told the Reps.
If the Government sticks to its
principles it will support Davidson to
the hilt, and give effect to his stern words
in Parliament.
The Golden City
Commercial Canberra today looks like
a boom oil-town in Oklahoma or the
more fabulous parts of Texas.
The city in 30 years has climbed
through gradations of development which
normally take about a century. In 1923
its population could have been put into
a couple of drays, and its centre was a
windy waste spotted with reddish sores
of bare earth in which a number of what
were apparently walking-sticks heralded
the incipience of the town forest. By
1930 it had accumulated about 2500
people; by the end of World War II
about 14,000 ; by the 1954 census 35,000,
and now the number is about 45,000,
though nobody seems to know exactly.
Canberra, in fact, has progressed like a
gold-rush. The only part of the primitive
that has not been defeated is the mag-
pies, though even these seem to have
become jet-propelled and to dive on the
bald pates of the unwary several times
faster than they used to when the Aus-
tralian Federal Territory was a pup and
there was scarcely an amenity or a warm
bed to welcome a stranger.
Canberra’s growth is not the product
of growing Parliament, for Parliamen-
tarians stay only as long as they have to.
But with the civil service crowding in,
the A.C.T. has become the greatest mine
of salary-nuggets ever known on this
continent, dug-up out of a complacent
Treasury and a willing Public Service
Board, and a magnet for all the camp-
followers of luxury trade who thirst to
get in on a good thing.
A glimpse at the Estimates for 1959-60
shows how rich a strike has been made by
the miners of the Molongo Valley, where
a central lake will soon separate the
aristrocracy of spending from the vulgari-
ties of supply.
Parliament alone houses two employees
who get over £4OOO a year, seven who
earn between £3250 and £3750, 26 who
earn between £2OOO and £3OOO, and a
goodly number in the £1250-to-£I9OO
range, some of them with extra pay for
performing “duties of a higher class.”
The Prime Minister has one at £6OOO,
one at £4152, eight averaging over £3OOO
and 50 averaging £ISOO. The Department
of External Affairs has a Secretary at
£SOOO, six assistant-secretaries getting an
average of £3350, two in the “directo-
rate” averaging £2BOO each, 79 officers
who share £143,600 between them in
unspecified moieties. And this is only the
“home-pitch,” which gets along with 302
employees. It doesn’t take in the Ambas-
sadors and Ministers, many of them doing
almost nothing save attend cocktail
parties and wait for a crisis which will
see them employed.
But the Treasury is the real paradise
—one at £6OOO, one at £4500, seven more
over £4OOO, 14 more over £3OOO and still
another 43 averaging over £2OOO. These
are merely the best-paid bats in the
Treasury home-team alone.
No wonder even the magpies are fat
in Canberra.
Growing-pains
The complacency with which the latest
report by the planning and highways
committee of the Melbourne Board of
Works has been accepted locally derives
in part from the satisfying knowledge that
Melbourne is now the fastest-growing
State capital, and that the population
will reach 2.25 million in 1970, five or
more years before previously estimated,
and that this progress must be paid for.
Yet many of the propositions advanced
by the committee are controversial. The
chief of these is the veiled request for
control over the outer shires of Lilydale,
Ferntree Gully, Cranbourne, Frankston
and Hastings, and Mornington on the
ground that the present metropolitan
boundaries are purely arbitrary and have
little geographical or regional signifi-
cance ; and that the principle of “con-
trolled outward expansion” under the
master-plan is being rendered ineffective
by development and subdivision of rural
areas.
The committee claims that arguments
for retaining the rural zones on the eastern
flanks are steadily becoming more and
more invalid as they become enclosed by
uncontrolled subdivision outside the
board’s control.
By this particular argument, the com-
mittee hints that the board should drop
the bit in the race to preserve a green-
belt outside the city because of what is
happening outside the green-belt and out-
side the board’s control; but the com-
mittee proposes to make more inroads
into the green-belt it already controls.
It also recommends that the suburbs
should be pushed gradually into the
present master-plan green-belt to accom-
modate an additional 250,000 people.
The committee estimates there are
38,000 vacant blocks supplied with water
in the metropolitan area, and 10,500 also
have sewerage facilities; to encourage
development, the holding of vacant blocks
should be made unprofitable, since a
big percentage are held for speculation.
How the committee can decide that a
big percentage of the vacant blocks are
held for speculation is not disclosed ; a
large number must be held by young
couples who prefer to wait rather than to
build on a shoestring, which was once
regarded as more virtuous than repre-
hensible.
The committee makes only passing
mention to the reconstruction of inner
Melbourne, although many miles of slums
still await demolition to make way for
big modern housing-schemes.
New Melbourne Brew?
[From “Collins Street”]
Noel Grave, the Melbourne hotel-
broker, is being sent to England by a
number of suburban hotel-keepers to
conclude negotiations with six English
brewing-companies to open a brewery in
the northern suburbs of Melbourne to
compete with Carlton and United.
Carlton is unpopular with some hotel-
keepers, and 71 attended the meeting at
which it was decided to make the firm
offer to the English cos.
Carlton is described by the recalci-
trant publicans as having a virtual
monopoly in Melbourne. There are,
actually, a number of strategically placed
hotels serving the beer of the Richmond
Brewing Co., but Richmond is reported
to have less interest now in competitive
local trade and much more in the lucra-
tive export business the company has
won.
The hotel-keepers’ proposition to the
overseas brewers is that they should put
up £2 million, and £1 million will be
raised in Melbourne ; but if the English
deal falls through, the locals propose to
raise the full amount in Melbourne.

“Ossie”: Went into a Sydney book-

I’d been instructed to get the previous
week, Albert having died in the mean-
time. When I reached the counter one
salesgirl was complaining to another:
“They make me sick. Didn’t care a hang
about him while he was alive. Now he’s
dead they’re rushing to buy his pictures.
Lot of ghouls, that’s all they are.” Then
she turned to me and asked “Are you

a grave-robber, I told her.
“Terry”: The patient was surprisingly
cheerful when told it was necessary to
encase her torso in plaster. Having
always been dissatisfied with the first

off by an obliging nurse that, for a while
at least, she could be moulded nearer

Below it, another picture showed the

throughout the world. The Maritime
Services Board launch sent a radio-
message to Birubi as she cleared Nobbys:
“Goodbye, Birubi, bon voyage!” and
got a reply: “Thanks very much ; good-
bye for ever.” Quite an emotional scene ;
but one observer, who hates smog,

in his military career he reached for a
rifle ; but he wanted reporters, not Japs.

composed largely of egg-white, was diffi-
cult to work, and it would take a shoe-
horn to pack a pound of the oddly con-
toured feather-light finished product into

number of inquiries still comes from old-

on minor business unrelated to the
illegal practices within, to be greeted
with' strident squawks of “Call the
coppers! Call the coppers!” as he came
down the garden-path. Having com-
pleted his inquiries of the lady of the
house, the constable, remarked upon the
amusing clarity of the bird’s exclama-
tions. “Oh, him!” the lady replied
sneeringly. “That’s all the dumb brute
can say.” The young copper put two

four on his way back to the station;


a “come-on” armed with a few marked
coins was sent in, and within the hour
one of Randwick’s most flourishing

permanent liquidation. There’s nothing

.... a silver zancle dated 350 b.c., which
is in near-mint condition.” I don’t know
what a zancle is or how much it is
worth, but if that one is really “dated
350 b.c.” it isn’t 2409 years old (or even
2309, which is probably what the reporter
meant to say) and it isn’t worth much,
except as an example of careless faking.

from their perfumed Paris salons issue
their imperious edicts, knowing that they
will be unquestioningly obeyed by the
world’s women. For, lo! one of them
who from time to time covers himself

great joy by the minority with soft,

there will be no sharp division among

round, I caught George, fiftyish and

Australian history. On that date in 1859
the steamer Admella, bound from

a ree f a t Carpenter’s Rocks, about 20
miles from Cape Northumberland, near
the s ou th Australia-Victorian border,
Her }jf e^oa^s were either crushed or lost
in attempts t 0 launch them and in a
short time the vessel broke into three
parts, with most of the survivors in the
after-part. On the third day after the
wreck two of the crew, Knapman and
Leach, managed to reach the shore on an
improvised raft and walked 19 miles to
Cape Northumberland lighthouse to give
the alarm. Then followed agonising days
for those still on the wreck, with the
shore only a mile away, but with no
means of reaching it. A pilot-boat, the
lifeboat from Portland (Vic.) and one of
the Admella’s boats which had drifted
ashore and had been patched-up made
several attempts to reach them, but were
forced back by terrific seas. Without
water, virtually without food, drenched
by the pounding waves and continually
exposed to the icy . August wind, the
numbers of the survivors dwindled daily
and it was not until the eighth day that
the 22 who still lived were brought
ashore. All three boats shared in the final
rescue, but the chief hero of the episode
was Ben Germein, the lighthousekeeper,
who patched-up the Admella’s crazy boat
and commanded it on its rescue-trips.
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s poem “From
the Wreck” was inspired by the loss of
the Admella.
THE MAGIC ATTRIBUTE
“Widow, m.-a., cooking-demonstrator, would

No exaggerated claim
Does this very modest dame
Adduce in promulgating her ambition
To be second-wife-elect —
That she’s always smartly decked,
Perhaps, or owns a loving disposition ;
Is sound of wind and limb,
Has a figure neat and trim,
A face that any man would term a
winner.
On one asset she relies,
And it cheerfully implies
She can rustle-up an appetising dinner.
She’s, aware —none better, too —
That the widdy well-to-do,
No mutter what her age, can be
exciting;
That the one who favors sport,
Or the dolly, frilly sort,
The hard-boiled blonde —they all can
be inviting;
Even those who’ll talk of Freud,
Or whose domes are mostly void
Of any nous, the near-saint or the
sinner —
But, to reach connubial bliss,
She bets heavily on this:
She can rustle-up an appetising dinner.
Of the bloke she would acquire
As a mate, she’s no desire
To seem too fussy. Jovial or sawny,
A cove who likes his suds,
Or prefers to grow his spuds,
A roly-poly, or one long and scrawny —-
To her they’re one. Her man
Needs one thing: a love of scran,
And in that line she’ll say she’s no
beginner !
Hey, you, there! Come, help yourself!
Here’s a treasure on the shelf
Who can rustle-up an appetising dinner.

Early Train from Richmond
By JOHN FOUNTAIN
IN Sydney, when people think
about commuting they
generally think of “The
Fish,” with its cargo of
hardy slaves from Katoomba
and such Blue Mountains
places, pulling into Central in
the morning • seldom, if ever,
of the workers’ special from
Richmond. But the Richmond
train, too, has a lot of character.
Although I never really
belonged—never, in fact, until
recently, when I acquired a few
acres of bush and a somewhat
comic house at a place called
Grose Vale, straying long from
King’s Cross when working in
Sydney—l did for a time travel
on “The Fish,” in a reserved
seat. If you don’t have a
reserved seat on “The Fish” you
don’t rate, you’re bundled in
the back with miscellaneous
baggage ; so I had the oppor-
tunity of studying “The Fish”
“regular” in all his austere,
early-morning glory.
Not at all a bad chap, this
newspaper - reading, early-to-
bed clubman, but, perhaps, a
shade conscious of his status
as a character, a bit anxious to
live up to it. The fault,
probably, of the papers he
reads so devotedly. Every now
and then you see something
about “The Fish” in the morn-
ing papers, and this insidious
propaganda is hard to resist;
as, of course, is any sort of
flattery. So, whatever the
merits or demerits of the
change, it was predictable that
there would be letters to
“S.M.H.” when “The Fish”
became electric.
r T'HE Richmond train (this
A one, anyway ; there is also
a motor-train to Blacktown) is
still steam, and few of its
regular travellers write letters
to the papers.
I’m not complaining, on
either score. Apart from its
griminess—which you get used
to and a tendency of the
younger passengers to court
each other by exchanges of
orange-peel and autograph-
books (a frivolity which
wouldn’t, of course, be
tolerated on “The Fish”), it is
a comfortable train.
Much, much more comfort-
able than the electrified cattle-
truck into which one clambers,
weighed down with a case of
work half-done and a so-called
portable typewriter, at Central.
The short trip from Central to
Wynyard is the worst part of
the journey. There are intima-
tions of the change before,
as far back as Parramatta,
and, as the horrid suburbs
gallop past, the sense of con-
finement grows. At Redfern
the city closes in, and once
aboard the electric-train it
takes you by the throat and
shakes you. It’s got you for
the day.
There are no reserved seats
on the Richmond train, but,
humans being the conservative
creatures they are, there are
unofficial reservations. The
tall, determined-looking man
with a briefcase who gets on
the bus at Kurmond, at Rich-
mond Station always makes
for a certain carriage, where
he takes a certain right-hand
seat, facing the engine, and,
no doubt, would be a bit dis-
concerted if he found someone
else occupying it. As the bus
usually gets to the station with
some minutes to spare, as the
tall determined man almost
always gets out of the bus first,
and as, anyway, there are
plenty of seats to choose from
at this stage of the journey, this
hasn’t happened yet, in my
time.
The Girl in White, who also
boards the train at Richmond,
picks a seat which would be
precisely opposite the Man
From Kurmond, on the left-
hand side, but in another
carriage.
The three men in what are
loosely called “working
clothes” (I’d like to know what
my white-collar rig is; cer-
tainly not a play-suit) the
one thick-set, dark, with a
white moustache; another
young, slim, fair; the third
young, dark, smiling, with
powerful shoulders and talking
hands —yarn in Croato-Serbian
from Richmond to the factory-
centre down the line where they
get off. They, too, have their
regular seats, the two young
ones facing the older man, who,
for a few stops, has a seat all
“Anything Wrong ?”
to himself. A nice gesture of
deference from the younger
men.
The Singing Boys from
Windsor, four of them, have
two facing-seats in the centre of
a certain carriage which I
have learnt to avoid. They
sing well enough, T suppose,
but with remarkable per-
sistence ; pop-tunes. In the
words of one of their favorites,
“Over, and over, and over
again.”
They interest me as social
phenomena (there are others
of their kind on the train, in
fact a whole carriage full, up
near the engine), the more as
the male late-adolescent of
my generation was an awkward,
inarticulate person, as apt to
appear naked as to burst into
song in public, his vocal rejoic-
ing limited to shower-rooms,
dormitories before lights-out,
and certain tribal occasions,
such as coming home on a
football-bus.
These uninhibited youngsters
are completely new to me and,
therefore, interesting. But a
little early-morning song goes
a long way. My chief objec-
tion is that the singing inter-
feres with my sleep.
/"\ne thing I learned in the
Army was to drop off as
soon as a vehicle began to
move. I slept, in fact, through
some expensive scenery and
most of the celebrated places
—one reason why old soldiers
and other tourists, after five
minutes’ interrogation about
parts I have claimed to visit,
invariably decide I am a liar;
so I have learned to shut-up
about my military travels.
When I became a Richmond-
train regular I was pleased to
discover that I had not for-
gotten this useful trick.
I began to take it into
account, sitting up an extra
hour or so, or even all night,
over work, knowing I could
catch-up on the train in the
morning.
After a couple of all-night
sessions I struck the Singing
Boys, and was pained to dis-
cover that, despite my best
endeavors, I could not sleep
through hit-tunes. Not con-
tinuously. I’d drift off, and
“Over and over” would jerk me
back to wakefulness. I’d nod,

POLITICAL POINTS
Aborigines, “unless they are primitive
or nomadic,” are to be eligible for the
old-age pension. Just as well the dis-
qualifying provision doesn’t apply to
M.Ps.
• •
Who wouldn’t be a public servant in
Canberra? Not long ago the court
rejected a taxpayer’s claim that fares to
and from work should be an allowable
deduction for income-tax purposes,
ruling that this was an expense which
should be borne by the taxpayer, not
the Government. Yet, according to the
Commonwealth Auditor-General, in the
case of some public servants in Canberra
the Government is not only paying for
their transport to and from work but
also, in some instances, home for lunch
as well.
• •
The official explanation for the change
in the system of pharmaceutical benefits
is that many doctors have been making
a habit of prescribing expensive drugs
which are on the “lifesaving” list —and
therefore free —when the patient’s needs
could be met just as adequately by drugs
not on the list, but often just as expen-
sive. This very human and quite under-
standable tendency to be generous to the
patient at the cost of the Government
(or community) would be almost impos-
sible to check, as the doctor must be
the arbiter of whether a particular drug
should be prescribed.
The decision to charge a five-shilling
fee for all prescriptions seems, therefore,
a very sensible one. It will mean that
everyone will now have to pay five-
shillings for items on the “lifesaving” list,
previously free, and five-shillings for
items not on the list, but which at present
cost the patient much more than five-
shillings.
There’ll be some complaints, no doubt,
but as far as the public are concerned
there’ll be more gainers than losers. At
the same time the Government bilk for
the really expensive “lifesavers” will be
kept within bounds, as these will only
be prescribed when no other drug could
do the trick.

The Auditor-General showed indigna
tion about allowances to public servants
for motor-car travel. He pointed to
one case in which an officer was receiv-
ing £l4 a week, and to the fact that
departments spent £34,000 in transport in
Canberra from July to December last.
He also pointed to unsatisfactory accoun-
ting systems, failure to observe proper
business procedures and the employment
of untrained and incompetent staff on a
substantial scale. But he is wasting his
breath. What would send shareholders
in private companies into a fury is
accepted in the civil service by taxpayers
as natural.

The most humorous sight of the year

Comrade Khrushchev, according to
A.A.P., has agreed to address the U.N.
Assembly next month while he is in New

The plan of the Chinese Reds is to
keep tension high in Laos without offer-

to be causing Peking a lot of worry.

[From Canberra]
Treasurer Harold Holt’s first Common-
wealth Budget quickly became known as
“Pastor Holt’s Biblical Budget.” The
title stems from its “Rob Peter to pay
Paul” format —so obvious when its
contents are studied.
While granting tax-concessions worth
£25 million a year to the taxpayers
generally, the Government holds out its
other hand for a return of almost
£2O million a year in increased postal
and telephone charges. Artie Fadden
previously resisted Liberal attempts to
raise postal rates. But came the Liberal
Treasurer and the pressure was increased.
P.M.G. Charles Davidson stood up man-
fully against them, even at one stage
considering resigning over the issue, but
when the chips were down Davidson
found he was without support.
• •
A feature of the' national-income
returns as shown in the Budget papers
is that in a year in which farm income
was £4OB million, against £519 million in
1956-57, salaries and wages showed a rise
of £2lB million over the £2828 million
paid out in the earlier year. It seems to
show which class now has the right to call
itself “depressed.”
• •
Downing, N.S.W. Attorney-General,
who intends to increase the fees of
N.S.W. jurymen, might do something to
improve the conditions under which jury-
men serve. Those called to some courts
are compelled, as they await the pleasure
of the court, to stand at times for
hours in an open and wind-swept street
in charge of a tipstaff and looking as if
they had all been arrested. And to be paid-
off they are led a hundred yards through
the traffic like the Sunday crocodile at
a girls’ school. It is no wonder Sydney
citizens hate jury-service and avoid it
where they can.
HEAVY ON THE FUEL


Both the Federal and N. S. Wales
Parliaments opened for business last
week. In Canberra, although it was
the Budget session, the most remarkable
feature of the proceedings was not
Treasurer Holt’s “nicely calculated less
or more,” but the unusual spectacle of
Government and Opposition members
debating an important piece of legisla-
tion without rancor and on a non-party
basis. The bill was the Uniform Divorce
Bill, introduced by Attorney-General
Barwick last May, the debate on which
was resumed on Thursday. Opposition-
leader Evatt, supporting it, said that
Labor’s decision to treat it as a non-
party measure had been unanimous.
In his opinion no other country had
made such a bold attempt to overcome
its divorce-problem.

The N. S. Wales Parliament was
elected last March,, but apart from play-
ing a couple of one-night stands,
members had done nothing to disturb
the silence of the Assembly chamber
before last Wednesday. It is under-
standable that in that stretch of time
there should be some cobwebs on the
division-bells, but that doesn’t explain
why 12 Opposition M.L.A.s didn’t hear
’em ring last Thursday. The plain truth
is that the dozen just weren’t there,
although it was only the second day of
the session, and as a result they missed
the chance to defeat the Government on
a gag-motion.
New leader Askin will be asking his
henchmen for “please-explains.” It is
hard enough to defeat a Government
motion when all Opposition members
are present, but when one in every four
is absent it’s a hopeless task.

Stan (D.L.P.) Keon, now a licensed
grocer in Melbourne, spiritedly denied
an imputation by Haylen in the Reps,
that he was the Victorian agent for an
imported Polish vodka. Just to get it
right: The only vodka he sells is good
old capitalistic vodka.

Latest into the bloody arena in Vic-
toria, where the experts are fighting-out
the advantages and horrors of compul-
sory blood-tests, are two Melbourne
scientists, Dr. N. E. W. McCallum and
Mr. R. C. Bayly, who reported that a
blood-test of a suspected drunken driver
was not a reliable indication of a blood
alcohol-level some time before the sample
was taken, and Dr. F. S. Hansman, the
Sydney biochemist, who urged the Vic-
torian Government to legislate for com-
pulsory blood-tests.
Dr. Hansman, who represented the
B.M.A. Federal Council on The com-
mittee which reported to the Federal
Government on medical tests to gauge
intoxication, claimed that the accident-
rate in Detroit dropped 75 per cent, in
the five years after compulsory blood-
tests had been adopted. With so much
conflicting advice from the experts, the
Bolte Cabinet must be feeling a little
tipsy.
Country-party M.L.A.s in Queensland
are concerned at the thought that pro-
posals to run joint-candidates (with the
Libs.) in Labor’s borderline seats could
affect the balance-of-power between the
two Government parties in the event
of successful candidates following the
lead given by John Murray, M.H.R. fpr
Herbert, who stood on a joint-ticket
and subsequently elected to sit with the
Liberals in Canberra. They don’t want
joint-tickets, but at the same time they
are opposed to preferential voting, which,
is the sane answer to their dilemma.
Government parties in Queensland
seem to be opposed to preferential voting
because it might reduce the advantage
they gain from the split in the Labor
party. This is mere expediency. Preferen-
tial voting would enable all four parties
to nominate candidates in doubtful seats,
leaving it to the electors to choose whom
they prefer. With a new electoral map
drastically altering the boundaries of
many seats, abolishing some and creating
other new ones, this is all the more
desirable.

Sydney City Council’s finance-
committee has recommended drawing-up
plans for housing projects on the site of
Victoria Barracks. Proposing this,
Alderman Ernie O’Dea said that the
Army had no moral right “to hold this
site from the people in a densely popu-
lated area like Paddington.” Would he
apply the same argument to Harold
Park or Wentworth Park? Randwick
racecourse, too, occupies a considerable
area of land in a thickly populated
district.

A few minutes before its option expired,
Underhill Investments took-up a 66-year
lease of the Western Market site, and,
subject to some dickering, will build a
25-story office-block on it; and Stanley
Korman wants a tower much higher
than Eiffel’s in the city. So far Korman
has got what he wanted.
Some paint was spread over its two
full stories at the city’s entrance a few
months ago, but all that will remain of
Old Melbourne soon will be Young and
Jackson’s.

Time lost through strikes in Aus-
tralia in the first six months of this
year totalled 185,000 working-days.
This is the lowest figure for any half-
year since 1935. Fewer disputes on the
coalfields and on the waterfront are
the chief contributors to the good show-
ing ; improved figures in those two in-
dustries outweighed an opposite trend in
some other industries. Hire-purchase
commitments and an appreciation of
what regular wages mean in a home have
a lot to do with the decline in strikes.

The ancient stand-by of the Briton —
habeas corpus —is in danger. The British
Government is proposing to amend the
law to provide for appeals on points of
law from the Divisional Court to the
House of Lords. H.C. had already
suffered a severe blow to its prestige
when last April the courts decided that
no longer could an applicant go from
judge to judge until he found one
merciful enough to let him loose. The
law in Australia also wants a bit of
looking into.

The A.W.U. has expelled one of its
long-term workers, Clyde Cameron,
M.P., who has been in the union, mostly
living on its pay, for the best part of 30
years. Mr. Cameron retires horrified at
the “terrorisation of A.W.U. officials,
corruption, breaches of rules and ballot-
rigging” and its “severance in Queens-
land of its historic ties with the A.L.P.”
As secretary of the S.A. branch of the
union from 1941, Cameron’s reactions
to turpitude and disloyalty to the A.L.P.
seem remarkably slow.

While reports are current that British

vehicles annually between Manhattan and
Staten Island, are to be fitted with
British radar. The same type of radar
has been fitted to the Brooklyn-Staten

Higher prices for copra, coconut-oil
and cocoa and a large increase in cocoa-
shipments have lifted the New Guinea-
Papua export revenues for the first nine
months of 1958-59 by almost £2,500,000
to a total of £25,230,000. Revenue from
rubber, plywood and gold was down, and
there was a big decrease in imports of
machinery and textiles. Trade is being
built-up with Canada, Japan and Ger-
many, but 60 per cent, of the Territory’s
exports came to Australia.

At a meeting at Renmark (S.A.) the
Federal Rural Committee of the Liberal
party urged the Federal Government to
establish a C.5.1.R.0. pasture-research
laboratory and experimental farm at or
near Townsville. Speakers said that the
right pastures would enable northern
Australia to carry many millions more
cattle. Townsville was suggested as the
site because it had a substantial popula-
tion and the educational and living
conditions to attract scientific personnel;
it was also the port for a hinterland
carrying lf-million cattle and was near
high- and moderate - rainfall country
capable of intensive development. It had
already been chosen as the site of a
university college, and the best C.5.1.R.0.
results had been obtained where the
organisation could work in co-operation
with a university.

“K.R.”: Two English sportsmen, one
a “centenarian,” the other not quite one,
have lately faded out of the international
arena in their respective games. One is
35-year-old Soccer centre-half Billy
Wright, captain of Wolverhampton
Wanderers and England, the only Soccer
player in the world to gain 100 full caps
for his country (he finished with 105).
Wright played his first international in
1946, and his 105th last season. A few
weeks ago he turned-out in early practice
games for the 1959-60 English season,
but was dropped completely off the
Wolves’ list. The other —his Test debut
also in 1946—was wicketkeeper Godfrey
Evans, who had his sights set on 100
Test appearances, but appears certain
now to finish with his present tally, 91.
He played in the first two Tests against
India this season, but, dropping a few
easy ones, he was himself dropped. No
cricketer has yet played in 100 Tests.

Frederic Pryce Evans, who has slipped
his cable in his 86th year, was one who
could properly be described as a master-
mariner. His early life at sea was in
various ships of the Union Steamship
Co. of N.Z., an extra-master, and a
Younger Brother of Trinity" House. After
World War I he became a barrister-at-
law. He was in command of the U.S.S.
Co. Koonya when in 1908 it towed the
Nimrod from Lyttleton to the ice for
the Shackleton Expedition. On the second
voyage south he was in command of the
Nimrod when he rescued the northern
party under P-ofessor David on their
return from their journey to the South
Magnetic Pole in circumstances of great
difficulty, and then picked-up Shackleton
late in the season on his return (1909)
from a journey to within 97 miles of the
South Pole. Captain Evans was awarded
the King’s Polar Medal for his services
on this occasion.

Lieut. - Colonel W. B. Thomas,
D. 5.0., M.C. and Bar, Assistant Military
Adviser to the U.K. High Commissioner
in Canberra, is flying to the United King-

vision film in the series “Men of Action,”
produced by General Sir Brian Horrocks.
The film will be shot in Winchester
(Eng.), depot of the Royal Hampshire
Regiment, to which Colonel Thomas now
belongs, and at Salonica, Athens and Mt.
Athos.
Lieut.-Colonel Thomas, an Enzedder,
served with the 23rd N.Z. Battalion in
Crete and was taken prisoner by the
Germans during the airborne invasion.
He had been severely wounded, and
tried to escape from a prison hospital
by “dying” and being carried out in a
coffin. But he laughed at the wrong
moment. He made a fantastic escape
later from Salonica, and got to Mt.


Athos, where he was given refuge by
the monks in monasteries in which no
female, human or animal, is allowed.
He eventually got to Turkey across the
Aegean Sea in a stolen boat and re-
joined the New Zealanders in the Middle
East. He is now a regular officer in the
British Army, and was engaged against
the Mau Mau. He has written two
books about his experiences.

Among the treasured possessions of
Alison (“Bing”) Bingle, who’s one of
the chief executives of William Angliss,
Ltd., in Sydney, is a letter written by
his great-grandfather, Captain John
Bingle. The Captain came to the then
colony of N.S.W. in 1821 and wrote his
birthday thoughts in 1878, comparing
conditions in Australia at the beginning
and end of the 57 years he had been here.
Bingle (pictured) was born “in amongst
the studs” at Dungog, in the Hunter River
Valley, in 1895, and, after education at
Barker College, Hornsby (N.S.W.), spent
a time learning surveying, before going
out to gain a thorough knowledge of
all branches of the pastoral industry as
a jackeroo with J. K. and W. H. Mackay.
He was rejected for service in War I,
because of an injury, but the knowledge
he gained at this time and in subsequent
years was valuable in War 11, when
he was called upon by the Army to give
expert advice on the problems and
terrain of northern Australia because
of the possibility of an enemy landing.
In 1920 he came to commercial life
in Sydney. As a partner in Cramsie and
Lethbridge, fat-stock salesmen and stock-
and-station agents, he travelled all over
STOCK
the eastern half of the Commonwealth ;
then, in 1929, he went back to the
Mackays to control their pastoral in-
terests, and in 1936 joined the Vestey
organisation. This long experience of
commerce, combined with his practical
experience of all parts of the fat-stock
industry—he's now on the chilled-beef
side, which he considers to hold great
potential—and its application to the meat-
trade, have made him an outstanding
authority, with a sound knowledge of
land and commercial law in all States.

“P.L.”: In name and family connec-

has lately increased the amount of
liability into which the corporation can
enter from £25 million to £5O million

THE EUCALYPTUS SPEAKS
[On the departure of some friends from
Rhodesia to settle in Australia.]
So you are going to that far-off country
Whose sun and soil and waters bred my
fathers?
There, plump and drowsy in my cousins’
branches,
The mild koalas munch their odorous
salads
Of bluegum leaves, and kangaroos
disport
Along vast miles of rabbits, while the
sheep —
Dim-faced dowagers, grey in respectable
wool —
Pause, and then gaze, one continental
moment ;
Ah, in my sap I feel it —feel Australia —
The bluegum - memoried breeze down
from the mountains
Cooling hot Sydney, meeting the salt
Pacific airs
That sing through the silver spars of the
great bridge —
Me, the expatriate, alien among the
msasas,
A ustralia rules; me, welcome on lonely
farms
On the Rhodesian veld, where I regard
The aboriginal aloes, the founder
euphorbias,
And they look back at me, with a friendly
air ;
And, as Australia in me is my being
And all the good I am in this new home,
So, all you lucky travellers, think of me
When you are in Australia, and take root
Deeper because of your long prosperous
years
In far Rhodesia, and remember me —
Remember us . . . the copper-red msasa,
The elephant still trundling on past
Wankie,
The aloe’s nostalgic scarlet on the
kopje ...
Remember us; remember Africa ...
Rhodesia.

ABORIGINALITIES
'V7'ears ago a big green frog decided
to put himself on the family strength
for lodging and rations, since when he
has been conceded the right to the run
of the house. But he knows his place.
On summer nights my final chore is to
give him a tap and say “Out!” Time
has softened what used to be a dirty
look to one of gentle reproach, but a
second nudge is never needed to prompt
his obedience. —“Sparrow.”

“Territorian”: A special refrigerated
unit, part of a 150 ft. road-train, will be
on the road soon in the Far North —to
carry frozen foods to the folk outback
even when the outside temperature is
110 degrees or more. It will be part of
a regular service between the Alice rail-
head and Darwin, with trips to Mt. Isa
as well.

“S.W.”: Add to the list of interesting
radio - station call-signs (B. 22 /7 / ’59),
2LF Young (N.S.W.). “LF” stands for
“Lambing Flat,” the original name of
Young, and is said to have arisen from
the fact that in the early days ewes were
taken to this sheltered site for lambing.

“L. 8.5.” (N.Z.): In declining my
application to operate a trans-Tasman
hovercraft-service, the authorities said
they must protect the rights of low-flying
albatross, whales (especially high-
spouters), flying-fish, basking-sharks and
stormy-petrels. In any case, the matter
was subjudice pending study of the re-
port of the Marker Buoys Committee of
the Freedom-of-the-Seas Division of
Unesco. This would soon be ready for
dispatch to Greenland for typing by
Eskimo experts. They also pointed out
that the findings of deep-sea fishermen
in Monaco, Andorra and Luxemburg
had still to be recovered from their in-
dependent chairman, a non-fishing
Nepalese, who was believed to have
hidden them in a Himalayan crevasse.
I gather that Abominable Snowmen are
still co-operating with Sydney detectives
in the search for these.
“Sanasi”: I can’t make head or tail
of the “in,” “at,” “on” business. In
Papua in the old days I lived “on the
Gira” and “on the Lakekamu”; they
were both goldfields. Bulletin “Silence”
notice of 20/5/’59 says the Osbornes
lived “on” Rossel Island. In Samarai it
would be said that they lived “out at”
Rossel Island. But it is only Sydney
news-reporters who would say that any-
body lived “at” Papua! Another Papuan
oddity is to say that you are “going
to Port,” meaning Moresby, whereas, in
northern South Australia you go “to The
Port” when you proceed to Port Augusta.

1/7/’59) he’ll give a wry grin. “The
Riding of the Rebel,” author unknown,
indeed! Thirty years ago every stock-
man’s hut and drover’s campfire could
have supplied the words of that ballad,
and the author’s name, though memories
sometimes failed conveniently towards
the end. Bush elocutionists and audiences
could accept the convention whereby
heroines, from Portia and Nerissa down,
have dressed as men and gone un-
recognised even by their husbands ; but
a girl who could handle a horse which
had killed three men well, they all
knew such tactless females did exist, but
no man with any proper pride cared to
admit it aloud.

“Imperial 55”: In our little lot there’s
Spud—Murphy, of course. Pirate Dick,
because he has a sunken chest. Rover,
who looks like a sheepdog who has lost
his flock. Sartorial, whose dress isn’t.
Pear Shape, for obvious reasons. Canary
Legs, because he has a wide range of
yellow socks. Mai, short for malnutri-
tion-tall, with a lean and hungry look.

“Eighty-three”: As one who has been
putting soft-drinks into bottles for well
over half a century, allow me to put
“B. A. Ker” right about those old-time
bottle-stoppers (B. 22/7/’59). The one
he found, which had a short wooden
rod and rubber ring, was not sealed, as
he assumed, by having the rod float up
to the bottle-mouth. Internal-stoppered
bottles were filled in what was known
as a “turnover-rack.” They were put
into this hand-powered filling-machine
head-downwards ; the machine was then
turned half-circle and the bottle filled.
It was then brought to upside-down
position, whereupon the stopper fell into
the neck, the pressure in the bottle hold-
ing it in position. The long stopper,
about the length of a forefinger, pro-




truded about fin. from the bottle-mouth,
and was prevented from turning round by
the bottle’s long, narrow shape. The next
invention was the Lamont-stopper, which
was shaped like a bullet about If in.
long, having a rubber ring around one
end, and loaded with a small ball of
lead moulded into the inside of the
opposite end. This weighted end made
the stopper pull the right end down (the
bottle, when filled, being inverted). The
bottle with marble stopper had a rubber-
ring washer in a groove in the head of
the bottle, which in manufacture was
blown up to the neck ; then the marble
was inserted, and the head put on by
another process. The tool for this made
a groove in the head to take the rubber

of an ear or something .”
ring, and the internal marble was seated
in this ring to seal the bottle. -The marble
was held at the neck during pouring by
a specially-shaped “thorax.”

“0.W.W.”: Boss was staggered when
he saw the new “roustie” from the city
throwing buckets of water over some
shirts and pants on the clothesline. “I
soaped them last night . . . thought

sadly.

“Fair Mac”: Don’t know on what
grounds that boxing-trainer who dis-
paraged the youthful Vic Patrick based
his observation that southpaws weren’t
popular with fight-fans (B. 15/7/’59).
Boxing history says that good southpaws
have always been beloved by fighf-
followers. Without a glance at a record-
book I could name half-a-dozen popular
mollydooks. Havilah Uren, brother of
triple-champion Tommy, packed the “Old
Barn” when he fought Billy Grime for
the lightweight title. Jack Finney’s
army of supporters kept the promoters
smiling. Eddy Butcher, a Westralian, if
my memory is reliable, was one of the
greatest crowd-pleasers of his day. And
probably the most popular of ’em all
was “The Mighty Atom,” George Men-
dies. The little flyweight, although
naturally dexter-dooked, used to bewilder
his opponents by changing to orthodox
and back again during rounds. Alas,
while repeating the manoeuvre against a
heavier man, whom he was nevertheless
outclassing, he was caught off-stance and
knocked-out, to die in hospital a week
later. Forty years and more must have
passed since Fred Kay took off his last
glove, but his old followers still enthuse
about his prowess. And if we want the
ultimate in proof of a fighter’s popularity
it must surely be when a town 12,000-odd
miles away is named after him: Bendigo
was a southpaw.

“North Esk”: A new unwanted
migrant - visitor to Tasmania is the
European wasp, thought to have
been introduced in cargo from Europe
or New Zealand, where it is com-
mon. Slightly larger than a honey-
bee, the worker - wasps have bright-
yellow bodies marked with a pattern
of black with four transparent wings
and six yellow legs. They build
papery nests in a hole in the ground, in
hollow-trees, roofs or walls of buildings,
and besides their ferocity they damage
ripe fruit and rob hives of honey.

“Big Billy”: Had just got into bed
when my son reported having seen the
light go on in the woolshed. We arranged
a pincer-movement—he with the rifle to
go to the front door, I to creep around
the back with the shotgun. We made the
surprise burst-in to find that an exploring
possum had managed to operate the
switch.

TROUT
A ll the trout in Australian streams are
bred from fish that were raised in
hatcheries. The original brown-trout
came from England, the rainbow-trout
from the U.S. via the hatcheries and
streams of New Zealand.
Trout-hatching goes back to 1843,
when a Frenchman, Joseph Remy,
succeeded in hatching a number of eggs,
or ova. He’d found that at spawning the
female trout made a nest, or mound of
stones, on the river-bed, where she
deposited the eggs ; and the male fish
then swam over the nest and sprayed the
eggs with milt, fertilising them. They
hatched in the running water. Remy
secured adult fish, stripped the ova from
the ripe female and the milt from the
male, mixed them thoroughly in a bowl,
and put them in a hatching-tray.
No doubt he had many failures at first,
and even now the process isn’t a simple
one. The eggs have to be watched care-
fully, and any that are infertile removed ;
if they’re not removed a fungus growth
attacks them, and this will kill the other
eggs. When the alevins hatch-out they’re
fed on minced-liver. Once, at Pemberton
(W.A.) they developed a form of goitre,
due to a deficiency of iodine ; they were
cured by feeding them craymeal.
Getting trout to Australia wasn’t any-
body’s picnic. About the middle of last
century several attempts misfired, one
shipment of 30,000 ova, sent from
England in an ice-house holding 15 tons
of ice, perishing gradually until the last
ova died a few days before the ship
reached Melbourne. Finally a shipment
got through with a few survivors, in 1864,
some going to Melbourne and the rest
to Tasmania. The Melbourne attempt
failed, but some hatched in Tasmania,
and, of these, six pairs reached maturity
and bred. They’re the progenitors of all
the brown-trout in Australia
The rainbow-trout was introduced
here much later. More popular than the
brown as a sporting-fish, he puts up a
better fight, and he is not nearly so
destructive.
Stocking streams with trout isn’t just
a matter of placing the fish in the water
and letting them fend for themselves.
Land will carry only so much stock ; so
will water. Each stream has a definite
capacity, and to get the best results you’ve
got to find out the number of fish it can
support.
Kelms


My first boss had a lot of “care-
ful” ideas and expected anyone
working for him to be “careful,” too.
That’s why, 30 years later, I find myself
driving a spade into the garden soil with
the heel of my boot. “Never push your
shovel in with the sole of your boot,
use the heel. There’s more leather there
and it don’t wear your boots out so
quick,” was old Joe’s instruction. A bit
awkward at first, but easy enough with
a bit of practice.—“Brolga.”

“Bass”: Anent the changing of ships’
names. As I recall, the first ships of the
Royal Navy to be named after venomous
reptiles, Viper and Cobra, both broke
their backs on their trial-runs. Are there
any snakes in the Navy now?
* * * *
“Senex”: Don’t know that “Sun-
ray’s” Royal Navy Biscuit (B. 8/7/’59)
had much of an edge on Army Biscuit,
1914-18. Although they would glow for
hours when used as fuel in an oil-drum-
cwra-brazier, they were never much
sought-after for their food-value until
Fritz dropped a few well-placed bombs
on the Boulogne bakery and put bread
off the menu for a couple of weeks. The
hale and hearty survived by cautiously
gnawing off small corners with their
eye-teeth. Old Shako didn’t own a tooth,
and solved his problem by pounding-up
his biscuit-ration in his tin-hat with his
entrenching-tool handle. The resultant
powder, made into paste with a few
drops of tea, was swallowed in pellets.
* * * *
“Macquarie”: An addendum concern-
ing those budgerigars that laid eggs and
hatched ’em in a nest-box minus a lid
(B. 17/6/’59). Hitherto I had merely
been able to conjecture on the mealtime
behavior of Budgie, jnr., based on the
loud squawkings from behind the wooden
curtain. But now, the lid being off, I
am able to report that young Budgie’s
table-manners are deplorable. He
screams and shouts with greed and
temper, tries to poke his bib in between
Pop’s fount and the young brother’s
equally open phiz, and generally harasses
the parent until Pop beats it with speed,
to alight on a perfh outside, chew-over
more nutriment—and maybe his off-
springs’ behavior —then dash inside again
to regurgitate a couple of swift gulps
into the more voracious and vociferous
mouth before once more bolting away
from it all. Whether Pop’s I.Q. is not
particularly high or his children have
got him that way is anybody’s guess, but
he invariably enters the nest-box through
the long spout, though he leaves it via
the open top.

Torres Strait Celebrates
•0 N 1793, two ships, the Hor-
muzeer and Chesterfield, under com-
mand of Captains Bampton and Alt,
sailing through Torres Strait to India,
picked-up Darnley Island, where Bligh
had been attacked by armed native
canoes some nine months previously. A
boatload of men of the Chesterfield went
“Sorry, sir, he Wont go away—says this land is his tribe’s hunting-ground !”
ashore a day or two later, but failed to
return, and a party sent off in search
found evidence of a massacre. The
locality went down on the chart as
Treacherous Bay, reprisals were carried
out, and the Union Jack hoisted as
symbol of possession of this and
neighboring islands and the coast of
New Guinea.
Seventy-eight years later, on July 1,
1871, another ship, chartered by the
London Missionary Society, sailed into
the bay carrying the first missionaries to
Torres Strait and New Guinea. During
World War I the L.M.S. handed-over
its work in Torres Strait to the Anglican
Church, and in 1921, when the islanders
were celebrating the 50th anniversary
of the arrival of the pioneer missionaries,
a festival titled “The Coming of the
Light” was instituted for annual obser-
vance on July 1. Since then the event
has grown in popularity throughout the
Strait, marked by a great gathering at
Darnley from neighboring islands, with
church services, picturesque processions
to Treacherous Bay (where a tall con-
crete cross has been erected with symbolic
figures at its base), and colorful native
dances.
The Government Administration has
given the “Feast of the Coming of the
Light” its blessing by making July 1
a holiday for the islands, and this year
the observance was bigger than ever.
Even in Cairns, 500 miles south of
Thursday Island, the Torres Strait com-
munity there celebrated it in the cus-
tomary island fashion, finishing-up with
a spectacular display in the aquatic hall.
When I lived on Darnley an old police-
sergeant, Spia—he’s gone to his rest now,
but many old hands of the Strait will
remember him—gave me a vivid account
of the first mission-boat’s arrival and
the events that followed. On the hill
above the church is a memorial-cross of
sandstone commemorating the 50th
jubilee ; at its foot two big clam-shells
hold a couple of large stones, called
Meb and Gerger, once used in native
ceremonies associated with the sun and
the moon. Darnley has its resident priest
today, the Reverend Boggo Pilot, of
native blood, who did his training at St.
Paul’s College on Moa Island, with some
further theological finishing-off at a Bris-
bane college. Just now he’s leading his
people in the job of rebuilding the white-
coral-lime church just up from the beach.

BUDGETING ON BIGGER BUSINESS
HThe first Budget of Treasurer
Holt is based on antici-
pations of increased personal
and company incomes during
1959-60, and upon an increase
in consumer-spending and in
imports. At the same time it
aims to avoid, in its own
effects, giving any general boost
to spending.
Though a 5 p.c. all-round
cut in personal income-tax is
being made, and some con-
cessions are granted in -regard
to undistributed-profits tax on
income of private companies,
an 11 p.c. increase in personal
income-tax collections is bud-
geted for on the lower rates,
and a rise of nearly 6 p.c. in
company-tax collections.
A lift of about 4\ p.c. in
sales-tax collections is counted
on, over 5y p.c. in Customs
revenue, and 4 p.c. in excise,
notwithstanding a remission of
yd. a gallon in Customs-duty
on imported petrol.
All these increases in revenue-
collections are being budgeted
for without any lifting of rates
of levy ; though, on the other
hand, there are no reductions
in sales-tax.
Post Office charges are being
raised —the ordinary letter rate
from 4d. to 5d., though the air-
mail surcharge will be
abolished on letters to be de-
livered within Australia. Tele-
phone charges are being in-
creased (local calls from 3d.
to 4d., with increased rentals),
but “local” calls are being
extended to some zones pre-
viously treated as trunk areas.
Some of the increases in
postal charges are staggering,
especially in respect of com-
mercial papers and the like— —
where they are almost doubled
—and follow a pattern of
favoring the personal tax-
payer or pensioner at the
expense of industry.
Including £16.3 million ex-
pected to come in this year
from higher postal charges,
total 1959-60 revenue is put
£97.4 million higher than last
year’s actual total at £1385.2
million

Among items of expenditure,

(up £22.6 million), repatriation

departmental (£7.2 million), the
Post Office (£8.5 million), pay-
ments to the States (up £35.1
million).
Main alterations in the
social-security scale are:
Increase of 7s. 6d. a week in
age and invalid pensions to a
maximum of £4 15s. a week, and
an increase of 7s. 6d. in widows’
pensions. Aborigines, “unless they
are nomadic or primitive,” will also
now be entitled to pensions and
maternity allowances where applic-
able.
Medical and hospital benefits will
be revised and extended; a charge
of ss. will be made for prescrip-
tions in place of present “free life-
saving drugs,” but a patient will
now pay only ss. per prescription
over a large range of drugs which
might cost him a great deal more
otherwise.
Service pensions will be raised in
keeping with the lift in invalid,
age and widows’ pensions.
The maximum allowance in
income-tax assessments for life-
insurance premiums, superannua-
tion contributions, etc., is being
raised from £3OO to £4OO a year.

estimates, deducts £37 million

vestment Reserve, from which
it is borrowed to pay for Loan
Council expenditure, in fact
his Budget is, revenue-wise,
designed to balance exactly.
Revenue of £1385.2 million is
offset precisely by an estimated
expenditure of £1385.2 million.
In the previous year there was
a revenue deficit of £9.3
million.
From the point of view of
revenue-p/ws-loan operations,
the Budget estimate is for a
cash deficit of £6l million,
compared with a cash deficit
of £29.5 million for 1958-59
(for which a cash deficit of
£llO million was forecast this
time last 7ear).
An accompanying table
shows how the anticipated cash
deficit for 1959-60 is arrived
at. The increased, estimated
deficiency arises from greater
appropriations for State works
and housing, and a lower ex-
pected response to public-loan
appeals.
Last year loan subscriptions
by the public and conversions
of old loans far exceeded
Budget expectations. Mr. Holt
is being cautiously optimistic
this year.
Treasurer Holt, in his
summing-up on the 1959-60
estimates, says that “the
economic prospects for this
year, as we now see them,
would certainly not justify any
large additional stimulus to
spending. The real question
has. been whether the cash
deficit should be as large as
£6l million for which the
present estimates provide.”
That the Government has
budgeted for such a deficit is
largely due to its decision to
increase social-service charges
and reduce income-tax.
The Government, however,
aims to get back to a balanced
cash-Budget as soon as prac-
ticable, and its policy for the
present is expressed as not
being aimed to give any general
boost to spending, but at pro-
viding, on the one hand, some
incentives to effort and enter-
prise, 'and, on the other hand,
“a degree of restraint on cer-
tain tendencies which, if they
became too exuberant, could
undermine stability.”
Mr. Holt added that, as one
of the world’s top 10 trading-
nations, we cannot insulate
ourselves entirely against what

happens elsewhere. But our
internal circumstances — more
efficient industries, greater
capacity, larger work-force and
improved industrial relations —
leave us favorably placed to
profit from rising world pros-
perity, and to cope with fluctu-
ations in fortune as they occur.
The Budget, disappointingly,
fails to deal with the clumsy
and discouraging payroll-tax,
the anomalies in company-tax,
and capital-erosion caused by
inadequate depreciation allow-
ances.
But the raising of the mini-
mum retention-allowance for
private companies from 25 p.c.
to 35 p.c. of profits gives some
welcome relief from the cum-
bersome 10s.-in-the-£ undis-
tributed-profits tax. And the
introduction of a withholding
tax on dividends payable to
overseas investors —3s. in the
£ on divs. going to the U.K.,
the U.S.A. and Canada, 6s. in
the £ to other countries—is a
sound move. It is still open to
recipients in these countries to
have the present assessment
basis applied, if they prefer.
Puri
[From Li. Owen]
A lthough the forecast of the
depth at which the
petroleum-bearing limestone of
the original Puri well should be
expected in the second devia-
tion (B. 29 / 7/ ’59) was accurate,
the hope expressed that it might
produce commercial oil has,
unfortunately, not been ful-
filled.
That is no fault of the
operators. Proof of proper
control of the deviation is
disclosed in the fact that the
average inclination to the
vertical between the drilled
depths of 7354ft. and 7664ft.
fat which point the limestone
was entered) is 16deg. 39min.
This is a smaller angle—though
not substantially so—than
those recorded above 7354ft.
That the siting of the devi-
ation was satisfactory is indi-
cated by the vertical depth
equivalent of the limestone
surface (7443ft.), which is 17ft.
above that of the original hole.
The unpredictable factor —in
the present state of our know-
ledge of the area—is the direc-
tion and extent of local
changes in porosity and perme-
ability \vithin the limestone bed,
and it is no one’s fault that
this factor has acted against a
worth-while strike at the point
at which the second Puri devi-
ation penetrated what was a
petroleum-bearing body in the
original hole.
TTe lack of porosity and
permeability appears to be con-
tinuing downwards, at least as
f ar as the latest reported drilled
depth of 7906 ft. Drilling and
testjng is still being carried out
howev and it is aI

It % should be remembered,
also, that the present borehole
is separated from that of the
original well at the limestone
surface by a distance (slightly
up-dip) of nearly 1300 ft. The
deviation constitutes, therefore,
what is, to all intents and pur-
poses, a separate test of the
limestone mass.
In any case, the testing of the
zone, both to the north and
south and running due west
from Puri, is an obvious neces-
sity.
The drilling of the Bwata
well is of exceptional interest
to all who look forward to
commercial production of
petroleum in Australia and
its Territories, but it should
not be overlooked —owing to
the unique character of Aus-
tralasian geological history
that classical methods of search
(often successful in other parts
of the world) have been proved
inapplicable to most parts of
that region.

28/7/’4l held on file in the
Bureau of Mineral Resources
confirms the following ex-
change of telegrams with Resi-
dent Geologist Barrow: —
“If present formation not
penetrated at 2000 feet suggest
dr F Jr 3RT^
in n.e. 3.”
“Raggatt concurs concentra-
ting on n.e. 3 as suggested your
radio 22nd.”
A letter from Mr. Barrow
dated August 10, 1941, asked
for early examination and
report on a core taken from
the Miauri bore between
2000ft.-2014ft. which showed a
marked change in rock type,
and stated that coring would
continue below 2014 ft. on the
possibility that the hole might
be approaching a more marked
formational change.
The hoped-for change did
not occur, and drilling was
fj na Uy suspended at 2086 ft. As
J r .. ... .
the Commonwealth Mineral
Resources Survey was not
formed until June, 1942, and
the Bureau of Mineral Re-
sources was not created until
May, 1946, neither body could
have had any share in the selec-
tion of the Miauri drill-site,
The statement quoted from
the press report of the chair-
man’s address confirms what
I wrote in an earlier contribu-
tion to The Bulletin —that the
decision to drill-
ing at Miauri was made by Dr.
Woolnough. This recom-
mendation as the record shows
was accepted by the company,
Dr. Woolnough made his
decision fully recognising that
Miauri Marsh probably repre-
sented a volcanic neck ; but he
believed that a bore at the site
selected offered the best pros-
pect of proving what lay be-
neath the volcanic rocks.
Wool Futures
[By Clive Hall]
Tn all the discussions that have
taken place about an Aus-
tralian greasy-wool futures
market, several important
factors appear to have been
overlooked. It must be acknow-
ledged that it is not only logical
but customary in any com-
modity market to “hedge” at
the source of supply.
First and foremost is the fact
that over 90 per cent, of, our
wool is bought by overseas
countries. I would suggest that
in an Australian greasy-wool
futures market over 90 p.c. of
the business would, therefore,
come from overseas. Of course,
if all the growers in Australia
sold futures at the one time
the effect would be just the
same as if they all sold their
wool at the same time: the
market would be considerably
depressed. However, the wool
clip is marketed in an orderly
manner, with sales spread over
the greater part of the year,
so that graziers using the
futures market would be
spreading their business in a
similar manner.
The operation of Japan, our
second-largest wool-customer,
has apparently not been con-
sidered. In this regard a con-
siderable number of the
Japanese woolbuying firms
now have their own offices and
staff established in the capital
cities of Australia, together
with their telex machines which
enable them to communicate
within a few minutes with their
head-offices in Japan, which
is done at least once a day and
in some cases more often. As
Japan has only one hour’s time-
difference from Australia, the
Japanese would be in a very
strong position to operate at
any time of the day whilst the
local futures market was open
here.
It is worthy of note that
Japan buys substantial quan-
tities of cotton from America,
and their exchange authorities
grant trade interests permis-
sion to operate and hedge their
commitments on the New York
Cotton Exchange i.e., they
buy at the source of supply and
use futures at the source of
supply. To date the Japanese
have not been able to obtain
sterling currency to operate on
the London Futures Market,
nor have they been reported as
buying wool in London.
It is interesting to note that
the present top-futures markets
are all located in the world’s
principal topmaking countries
and afford a valuable means of
insurance for those in the top-
making business.
The world's largest futures
market in wool today is the
New York Grease Wool
Futures Market, the turnover
on which over the past four
months has exceeded that of
the London Tops Market.
A lack of speculators has
been suggested as a weakness
in an Australian market. A
speculator in commodities is
not, to apply the accepted sense,
a disreputable character. On a
futures market he is an essential
operator, as by his participa-
tion he helps to spread the
.risk. The presence of specu-
lators on the London Futures
Market has over the past
twelve months been almost
entirely responsible for sup-
porting futures prices at some-
where around 10 per cent,
above “spot” levels.
A further point which
appears to have been over-
looked regarding the volume
of business on a local market
is the arbitrage dealing i.e.,
buying futures in one country
and selling them in another
country, or vice versa.
With only one greasy-wool
futures market in existence to-
day (in New York) there would
surely be considerable arbitrage
business between that market
and a local greasy-wool futures
market.

same time keep the takeover
wolf from the door, the board
of Lennons Hotel, Ltd. (Bris-
bane), are giving shareholders
a one-for-two bonus handout
and a share-split.
In the terms of the trust-
deed, holders of the 500,000 £1
7 p.c. unsecured notes may ex-
change half their holding for
fully-paid ordinary shares to
enable noteholders to partici-
pate in the bonus-issue.
“Ex-bonus”, ordinary capital
will stand at £1,080,000 in ss.
stock-units, and, based on this
year’s profit of approximately
£120,000, the earning-rate will
be a shade over 12 p.c. (after
allowing for decreased interest
charges).
Provided profit remains at a
satisfactory level, shareholders
can expect at least a 10 p.c.
distribution over the next
financial period.

With the opening of the new season close at hand, we set out below a table showing London
Wool Tops Futures prices and their relative Australian wool values in order to assist any wool-
grower who wishes to insure the price for ALL or PART of his clip against a fall, even though the clip
may not be coming up for sale till next June. He insures this price by selling futures.
If you sell futures at the prices listed in Column 1, by reading across the table from that price you
are shown the clean on floor or greasy equivalent values in Australian currency.
At the time of writing values on London Futures are between 110 and 114 pence stg., which
represents an improvement of over 30% compared to last season’s low point.

The Bolshoi Ensemble
The Bolshoi ballet company
seems to be whizzing round
Australia in one of its own
Sputniks. By the time The
Bulletin’s Brisbane review
had arrived they had already
had their opening-night in
Sydney at the Elizabethan
Theatre; and on August 23,
almost as soon as this page is
printed, they will be in New
Zealand.
•Wherein we see both the
disadvantages and the advan-
tages of the space-age. For
if they had had to come out by
ship, as in the old days, they,
might have sent the full huge
company and the stupendous
scenery, and might have stayed
in each city long enough for
everybody to see them. 'On
the other hand, if it hadn’t
been possible to whizz a few
principals out by air, they
might have decided that the
tour was too complicated to
organise, and so not have
come at all. We must be grate-
ful for this foretaste of what
they can tlo —for it is superb—
and hope for a full feast next
time.
Sydney gave them a
tremendous reception—nothing
less than three curtain-calls for
every item, and sometimes up
to six—and yet that, so James
Mills of the Elizabethan Trust
told The Bulletin, was noth-
ing to the receptions they got
in both Brisbane and Mel-
bourne. So—since in any city
all you can do is join in the
applause here followeth the
Brisbane review':
The Bolshoi Ensemble
packed the big new Festival
Hall in Brisbane and christened
it as a theatre in the real sense
of the term. The dancers ap-
peared without orchestra, and
against a jet-black velvet back-
drop that set-off the glitter of
many of the costumes. With-
out props, they had to work
on the imagination of the
audience much as Elizabethan
actors used to do. And, as
with all actors who know their
jobs, they had no trouble
creating their own atmosphere
from one dance to the next,
aided of course by costumes of
the finest splendor.
The company is a group of
picked dancers such as might
tour the Russian provinces,
penetrating into places unable
to accommodate the 200-
strong Moscow theatre. And
if the excellence of these 12
dancers is a true pointer to
Bolshoi perfection, the Rus-
sians seem to have solved the
problem of sharing the great
theatres of the cities with
“ That's one film the kids Wont be seeing !”
country towns that might
otherwise be neglected.
The masculine, athletic men
and the tall ballerinas were
complete masters of their art,
and the blue curtains of the
Festival Hall that opened so
slowly and magically on the
adagio from “Swan Lake” are
not likely to introduce so
enchanted an evening as this
for a long time.
It is difficult to single-out
individual excellence in so
closely matched a company.
The principal male dancer,
Yuri Kondratov, was an impos-
ing Prince Siegfried and an
uncannily sensual Bacchus ill
the Walpurgis Night scene
from Gounod’s “Faust.” In
the opera this is a horror scene,
and the sweaty bacchanal
dreamed-up by these dancers
was far more vivid than
Gounod’s tame and ladylike
music. Hearing this discoursed
by piano, violin and ’cello on
the side of the stage was like
watching grand passions in a
tea-shop.
Several dancers were able to
give the illusion of hanging
motionless in mid-air for a
moment or two. Rimma
Karelskaya did this as the
Swan Princess from “Swan
Lake,” and it became the main
thrill of a wild dance from
Khatchaturian’s “Gayaneh”
done by one of the male
dancers, Kashanyi. A moun-
tain dance accompanied by a
drummer thudding away to
screaming-point was close to
the popular idea of Cossack
dancing and brought the only
encore that was permitted.
The loveliest dance of all was
to Gluck’s ballet-music from
“Orpheus,” the famous flute
melody here quite competently
replaced by a violin. The
timeless quality of this music
was matched by a dreamlike
movement that floated across
the stage.
The four musicians were all
skilful in disguising the absence
of a big orchestra, and the
broad tone of John Kennedy’s
’cello was worth hearing in its
own right anyway. Except in
the Gounod music this lack of
orchestra was never very dis-
turbing, though much of the
music for the dances of the
second half was woefully
inferior to the Tschaikowsky
and Glinka that began the
programme.
All things considered, the
precision and grace of the
Bolshoi company provided the
most remarkable evening since
the Chinese Opera, just as
spectacular and all the more
remarkable in the way it drew
infinite riches from so small a
group.
D.J.M.
Violin Sonatas
Though it never climbed to
rarefied heights, the playing of
Yugoslav violinist Igor Ozim
and Austrian pianist Ilse von
Alpenheim at Sydney Town
Hall, under the aegis of Musica
Viva, had. enough technical
security, neat integration and
expressive warmth, all in-
formed by a keen appreciation
of the mood-requirements of
the four composers chosen, to
make a thoroughly enjoyable
recital.
There was a verdant fresh-
ness in Beethoven’s “Spring”
Sonata, though in the early
stages the keyboard fell slightly
behind in assertiveness a
deficiency which was elimi-
nated as the work progressed.
The pianist’s crisp, lucid
filigree-work in the beginning
of Schubert’s Sonata in A
Major, Op. 162, was a lovely
background for the violin’s
stream of finely toned lyricism.
This sonata is, in effect, an
apotheosis of song, with the
violin as the voice and,
indeed, Mr. Ozim at times
achieved a tone strikingly like
a soprano.
Sprightliness was at a slight
discount in the first movement
of Max Reger’s Sonatina in D
Minor. But a full measure of
rich musicianship went into
the variations of the third sec-
tion, where the composer’s
seriousness yields to an endear-
ingly lighter touch.
The violinist conjured a tone
of good depth and breadth
from his low string in the medi-
tative first movement of
Honegger’s Sonata No. 1, and
here the pianist used a most
feathery touch to good effect.
But, as so often happens with
this uneven composer, the
sonata then plummeted into
raw-nerve rantings in the final
section.
Artbursts
Antipodeans
The Antipodeans, showing
three rooms of pictures and
ceramic sculpture at the Vic-
torian Artists’, are eight well-
known Melbourne artists in
revolt against the fashionable
abstraction ; and in an uncom-
promising manifesto they
make no bones about it. The
abstract in art, they say, is
death to the living image. In
fact, they deny it the name of
art; or, if it is art, it is of such
a low order as not to merit
consideration, least of all
official recognition.
Antipodean means, by
definition, to be diametrically
the opposite of something, and

if we are to understand what
these artists mean we have to
discover the something they
are opposing. The manifesto,
though strongly worded, doesn’t
make itself quite clear on this
point.
If the art they refer to is
the thousands of abstractions
which have lately been flood-
ing Melbourne, and even
invading the National Gallery’s
sacred precincts, there seems
to be some justification for
their anger. Even untutored
school-kids are producing them
by the dozen just as well as
their elders.
But if a principle is involved
it must apply in all cases, and
the Parthenon and Rheims
Cathedral are as abstract as
anything could be. It could
hardly be said that Rheims
Cathedral wasn’t just as living
as a Rembrandt portrait and
that there wasn’t just as much
of Nature’s accent in it, though
the form is different. The
architect uses stone, the artist
pigment; each has some image
in his head, and the physical
result is his attempt to externa-
lise his image ; this also applies
as much to a lovely Persian
carpet and a modern auto-
mobile as to Melbourne’s
pseudo-Greek and pseudo-
Gothic buildings. Some look
living, some dead; so there
is nothing wrong with the
form, though there may be a
lot wrong with the contents —
as with beer.
The manifesto also implies
that figurative art is in some
way better than non-figurative
art. But is it? A nude may
be more exciting from the
anthropomorphic point of
view than an abstract, but that
doesn’t make it better art if
it is badly painted.
Applying this principle to
the current exhibition, it can
be stated that all the artists
represented have artistic
sensibility, some more than
others. Arthur Boyd shows
sensibility in bits of back-
ground-landscape, echoes of the
period when he was dominated
by Breughel ; in his phantom
brides and persecuted lovers
he is only sensitive to Picasso.
John Perceval loves Williams-
town, and Williamstown is
meet to be loved. He gets a
lot of that love into his shark-
boats, black swans, smoky
skies and heavenly blue water:
as also another kind of love
into his fat ceramic babies.
Charles Blackman and John
Brack are sensitive to children,
but their work never gets above
the level of the cartoon. Clifton
Pugh succeeds most in his
“Rape of Europa.”
M.G.S.
Pastels By Orban
Three things combine to
make Orban’s show of pastels
at Sydney Macquarie Galleries
distinctive and distinguished:
his strong, harsh, masculine
use of the medium; his firm
draftsmanship which removes
any trace of the happy-go-
lucky from an abstract; and
his sombre force of person-
ality which again persists
through the veil of abstraction.
Most of the pastels here
are abstracts, and it is not easy
to determine whether this de-
parture has been to Orban’s
advantage or not. On the one
hand, when he does make a
realistic approach, his uncom-
promising jugs and bottles and
his effective but cadaverous
flowers are not very inspiring;
on the other hand, even so
attractive an abstract as “Whirl-
wind,” full of movement in its
swirling design and lovely in its
deep blue and orange, remains
imprisoned within the inescap-
able limitations of abstraction
—it is design and color only.
Curiously enough, the one
pastel which he has entitled
“Abstract” is—or seems to be
—one of the closest of his
abstracts to realism: it looks
like a pattern of brown gum-
leaves and white stumps. Simi-
larly, “Fabulous Landscape”
is not so fabulous as to pre-
clude an appearance of green
spaces and interlocked architec-
tural forms: it is more surreal-
istic than abstract. And it is in
works of this kind, combining
realism and abstraction, that
he is most satisfying.

John Bell
In his show of 18 oils and
drawings at Sydney’s Terry
Clune Galleries young artist
John Bell, concentrating for
the most part on imaginative
themes, is always interesting,
generally colorful and occa-
sionally really rings true.
Neatly balancing a lack of
purpose in some of the more
imaginative oils by careful
draughtsmanship and figure-
arrangement in his more con-
crete subjects (as in “Young
Clown,” a study in warmth of
background and suppleness of
form) Bell nevertheless suc-
cessfully exploits a blaze of
symbolism in “The Choir
Master,” where the richness of
green in the central figure, the
power of the hands and
strength of expression are
linked to miniature Crucifixion
and death symbols. “Shep-
herds' 5 is a fantasy in elusive
tones, and in “The Hero” Bell
momentarily descends to
mockery. Of his drawings,
“Crouching Negro,” done in
cocoa-crayon with black-pencil
outlines, has plenty of exciting
movement. The other sketches
are, generally speaking, slight.
Films
“Warlock”
A spacious, well-knit and
exciting western. An ex-gun-
fighter with a formidable re-
putation is hired by the scared
inhabitants of a town which
has long been at the mercy of
a lawless element. His prompt
and resourceful measures get
results ; then the clash of wills
between this unofficial law-
bringer and a deputy-sheriff
appointed thereafter to keep
the dubious peace gives the
second part of the film a
quality even more explosive
than the first.
Director Edward Dymtryck
keeps proceedings taut, builds
climaxes with logic and delib-
eration and weaves-in two
secondary romances without
damaging the texture of the
main plot. He is well served
by Henry Fonda, exuding
strength and an easy self-
assurance as the ex-baddie
turned lawman ; Richard Wid-
mark, as the deputy determined
to run things his own way ; and
Anthony Quinn, as a semi-
cripple almost pathologically
obsessed with protecting the
ex-gunfighter simply because

“How to Murder a Rich
Uncle”
This English comedy is,
rather, a demonstration of how
not to bump-off an avuncular
relative ; for the various
attempts by a titled but hard-
up English family to knock-
off their American uncle for
his sizeable wad backfire hard
enough to keep the undertaker
busy planting the conspirators
while the octogenarian emerges
as hearty as ever. The script
is so cleverly devised that a
good case is climatically made-
out to arraign the intended
victim for the murder of those
who had fallen while trying to
do the foul deed, but one vital
witness gets him out of it.
It is all very hilarious, with
veteran Charles Coburn as the
uncle, Nigel Patrick as the
suave planner, and Wendy
Hiller as the gentle wife who
feeds him some choice ideas on
mayhem.

“No Time for Tears”
A children’s hospital is the
setting for this English mix-
ture of heartache and comedy ;
and while the little patients are
allowed to be their natural
selves —luckily, for a good deal
of the running-time—the film
has considerable charm. There
is real poignancy, too, in the
case of a small boy whom the
doctors battle selflessly to save
from the threat of unsuspected
diabetes. But along with the
homilies of sisters to junior
nurses on the dangers of giving
their hearts to either handsome
doctors or small patients,
there, is an oversweet matron
(Anna Neagle), and a picture-
card glossiness about the wards
which too obviously smacks
of fancy rather than fact.
Anthony Quayle bears an
easy authority and is matey
with the kiddies in his role
of chief physician ; Sydney
actor Alan White does well
as a junior doc. with a breezy
manner; and Sylvia Syms
decorates the wards nicely
without recourse to things like
streamers.
On Hoyts’ Circuit.
“Call-girls”
Without the cheap sensa-
tionalism which might be in-
ferred from the title, this
Danish film set in Copenhagen,
with German dialogue and
English sub-titles, exposes
soberly and, for quite a bit
of it,, with restraint, the activi-
ties of a procurer who uses a
respectable-looking lingerie
business as a facade, with his
numerous “models” visiting
the firm’s “clients.” To this
concern, in all innocence,
comes a German girl forced
to leave home by a jealous
mother and the mother’s
promiscuous lover, and now
searching for a girl-friend who
has held-out an inviting picture
of a glamor job. She is caught
in the whirlpool, and police-
action cripples her chances of
a promising marriage.
Ingmar Zeisberg gives a fair-
enough account of the girl’s
bewilderment and shame ; but
her work is bettered by Claus
Holm as the disillusioned
fiance.

“It Happened to Jane”
Doris Day’s bright per-
sonality beams over this
comedy about a young widow
of spirit who takes-on at litiga-
tion a railroad-tycoon whose
inept system is ruining her
business as a supplier of live
lobsters. It’s the old theme of
the game little underdog
battling against long odds and
limitless resources and never
acknowledging the possibility
of defeat, but this variation
has enough imaginative rich-
ness and ebullience to give it
freshness.
' The spring beauty of the
Maine seaside-town in which
it is set comes out well under
the color-cameras; and the
story unfolds easily. Support-
ing the infectious Miss Day are
Jack Lemmon, neatly limning
the character of a solid small-
town attorney ; and Ernie
Kovacs, who injects sharp

“The Mysterians”
A common-denominator of
science-fiction “thrillers” in-
volving earth-invading beings
from Outer Space is their
dullness —and this one is
duller than most. The Mys-
terians, coming from some
planet behind the moon, ap-
parently stopped-off at Oxford
to allow their leader to acquire
the accent before going on to
invade Japan, whose inhabi-
tants speak with a strong twang
of the U.S. Middle West. The
object of the invasion is to grab
some nifty Japanese girls to
improve the breeding-stock of
Mysterians, the current crop of
Mysterianesses seemingly
having become sterile through
over-exposure to radiation.
Dialogue and acting are about
on a par with the story.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Rothmans of Pall Mall (Aust.), Ltd.
The Australian tobacco industry is
concentrated, and the number of
manufacturers is small. The largest
by far is the giant British Tobacco
Co. (Aust.), Ltd., and its manufacturing-
subsidiaries (total paid capital £20.45
million). In all, eight companies employ
more than 90 p.c. of the total labor-
force in the industry.
Consumption per head has increased
from 4.5 lb. in 1938-39 to 7.3 lb in
1957-58, following the big influx of
migrants. However, the rate of increase
has been slipping.
Consumer - preference for “tailored”
cigarettes has become very pronounced
in recent years. Since 1953-54 the
demand for pipe and “roll-your-own”
tobacco dropped by over 25 p.c. For the
same period sales of cigarettes have in-
creased by about 32 p.c.
The industry is one in which the
margin between production and distribu-
tion costs and the retail sales-price is
narrow, and cost-increases are difficult
to pass-on to the consumer because of
strong competition. There is- wide scope
for Government intervention at all
stages through import-licensing, duties,
excise, sales-tax, and, finally, stipulation
of the proportion of domestic leaf to
be used in the manufacture of cigarettes.
Competition has been fierce among
cigarette-manufacturers the world over.
Huge sums are being spent annually on
all kinds of advertising media; every
gimmick is used to claw the path to the
summit ahead of others. The Australian
market is no exception, although the
forms of rivalry are as yet, perhaps,
more restrained than elsewhere, even if
the exchanges between competitors tend
to become more and more acrimonious.
In these circumstances Rothmans’
successful breakthrough into the
cigarette-market in 1955, and its subse-
quent meteoric performance in sales-
tactics and financial policy, have brought
sharemarket acclaim. This year the co.
is paying its maiden dividend: an interim
of 4 p.c., and the final 6 p.c., chalking-up
a comfortable 10 p.c. for the past
financial year.
Rothmans continue to concentrate on
the filter “king-size” market, putting out
the first-born “Rothmans” (also sold as
plain and cork-tipped but on a much
smaller scale); “Peter Stuyvesant” (a
somewhat longer filter); and the latest
release, “Rembrandt” (a “novelty ver-
sion” of the original filter, introducing
the new “multivent porous paper” which
has been quite successful with its “longer,
cooler smoke” effect in a recent debut
on the American market).
It is estimated that “king - size”
cigarettes account for about 25 p.c. of
the total Australian market, and prac-
tically all of this is claimed by Rothmans’
brands. Demand continues to be high
and outruns the available supplies. The
“Peters” are doing very well. It is too
early to judge the “Rembrandts.”
Rothmans’ first decisive victory was
scored when it established itself firmly
on the market in 1955. Since then it
has succeeded in keeping its competitors
on the defensive and pressed boldly
ahead, wiping-out its earlier losses. Last
year’s phenomenal results are shown in
this comparative table:

Turnover is not disclosed, but stock has
risen by £1,276,454 during the year. It
is reported that the retail value of all
Rothmans sales exceeds the rate of £32
million a year. Monthly turnover is 350-
million cigarettes, out of a total Aus-
tralian monthly figure of 1350 million.
Profit before tax leaped by £750,980
to £1,003,419, after providing £121,998
for depreciation (up £36,219), paying
directors’ fees (£8000) and interest on
borrowings (undisclosed ; previous year
£154,769), and all other expenses. Tax
provision was £319,300, leaving net
profit for the year £684,119 (up £431,680),
and representing an earning-rate of 40.54
p.c. on the average capital employed,
more than adequately covering the
maiden 10 p.c. dividend.
However, in evaluating the 1958-59
profit, it must be remembered that the
company’s income-tax was reduced by the
balance of losses carried forward from
the first two years. Normal tax would
have been about £376,282, reducing net
profit to £627,137 (37.1 p.c. on capital).
Demand is still ahead of supply. The
earlier policy of concentrating on boost-
ing sales in spite of initial losses has
paid-off. Rapid expansion of productive-
capacity continues. The original Gran-
ville factory has been worked consistently
two shifts a day, plus maximum over-
time. Its output is about 10 times the
figure originally planned.
To cope with the backlog of unsatisfied
demand, a factory-area of about 11 acres
has been acquired at Tottenham (Vic.).
Directors report that production will
start within the next few months.
Additions to plant and machinery were
visibly £293,210, and further substantial
expenditure is envisaged to complete the
equipment at Granville and to cover
the first stage of installations in Vic-
toria. On buildings £149,705 was spent,
and a further £328,000 will be paid out
in the current year.
There are 125,000 20s. deferred shares

down borrowings from this source to

A final, sober reflection. Rothmans
picked the right moment and gimmick
to force its entry on the Australian,
market. The lung-cancer scare, and the
swing to filter-tipped cigarettes which
had followed in its wake, played a leading
part in the spectacular success of the
company’s debut.
Thus far, Rothmans has staked its
success on the demand for “king-size”
filters. Its sales of other cigarettes are
negligible by comparison. If fashions
change again (and at the moment there
is no indication of that) a quick adjust-
ment will be necessary, and British
Tobacco’s formidable competition will
have to be faced on different ground.

world-famous distinctive packets), seem to
indicate that British is con-
solidating its hold on the non-filter
market. Initially, the “Luckies” are doing
very well, and an extensive sales-promo-
tion campaign is being conducted.
In U.S., after numerous surveys and
counter-surveys trying to link the inci-
dence of lung-cancer and smoking habits,
the cigarette-market has stabilised with
the filter-tips holding about 50 p.c. of
all sales. If Australian and American
trends are comparable, Rothmans have
another 25 p.c. of the market to compete
in on these figures.
However, American consumer - tastes
are much more susceptible to rapid
variations and swings. (Thus the new
menthol-flavored cigarettes gained 10 p.c.
of U.S. sales in a few weeks.)
Australian Cement, Ltd.
A ustralian Cement, Ltd., is an equal
partner with Kandos Cement, Ltd.,
in Australian Portland Cement Pty.
Cement-production is a basic industry
in which level of activity is intrinsically
related to rates of construction of com-
mercial and factory buildings, houses
and major developmental works. As
such it provides an excellent indicator
of economic progress.
Australia's need for cement has in-
creased tremendously in the post-war
years owing to the maintenance of high
levels of building and construction
activity, and in particular to large
developmental works such as the Snowy
Mountains Scheme and the Warragamba
Dam. Indeed, demand increased so
rapidly that, for a number of years, local
production lagged considerably behind
requirements, and very sizeable imports
were necessary. These reached a peak
of 350,000 tons in 1951-52, but have since
become progressively smaller until last
year they were limited to small quantities
of white and colored cement only.
By comparison with most manufac-
turing - processes, cement - production
capacity is inflexible —that is, non-
expandable—over the short period.
Plant, because of its necessary size and
specialised nature, can’t be planned and
brought into operation except in the
long term. For example, two years
might be expected to elapse before a
new kiln can be installed and put into
operation. For this reason planned
development is essential, and excess
capacity from time to time becomes
inevitable. In a period of growth such
as Australia is experiencing, it is desirable
both in the interests of the country and
of the industry itself that capacity should
be at all times ahead of demand so that
development will not be hampered.
All States except Victoria are now
producing sufficient cement lo cover their
own requirements. In the southern State,
demand still appears to exceed produc-
tion, but whereas, until recently, exten-
sive supplies had to be brought in from
N.S.W., S.A., and Tasmania, require-
ments are now almost wholly satisfied
by local manufacturers. This newly
gained independence can be attributed in
very large measure to Australian Port-
land Cement Pty., by far the biggest
manufacturer of cement in Victoria. Last
December the co. completed the installa-
tion of a new production-unit at its
Geelong premises, and in one giant
stride virtually freed Victoria from
dependence on its neighbors. The
Geelong works are now capable of an
output of 500,000 tons of cement a year
—provided, of course, satisfactory work-
ing conditions can be maintained.
The entire £4-million of share capital
issued by A.P.C. Pty. is held in equal
lots by Australian Cement, Ltd., and
Kandos Cement, Ltd. The undertaking,
overall, is by far the largest producer
of cement in the Commonwealth, and
with major interests in N.S.W. and Vic-
toria —A.P.C. Pty. owns the ' biggest
cement-works in N.S.W. at Kandos —it
is well situated to stabilise its earning-
power, and each holding co. participates
equally in this benefit.
In the earlier post-war years, greatest
emphasis was given to housing, and very
little other building was permitted. Since
then, with the easing of building restric-
tions, the emphasis has moved toward
commercial and factory buildings.
Nowhere is this shift more evident than
in the cities themselves. Torn-down,
added to and replaced, the skylines of
Melbourne and Sydney change almost
from day to day. It is not surprising that
A.P.C. Pty. has commenced construc-
tion of a new cement kiln with auxiliaries
at Kandos (N.S.W.). It is expected to
start producing by 1961, and would seem
to be of a size similar to the Geelong
plant.
Figures for A.P.C. Pty. are not dis-
closed, and all that shareholders in Aus-
tralian Cement, Ltd., get a look at is
dividends from investments, plus a small
income from Commonwealth loans, com-
missions, etc. Last year profits at
£158,022 (up £2425) were sufficient after
payment of petty expenses and directors’
fees, to show 11.1 p.c. on the capital of
the holding-co.:

The 10 p.c. div. was again repeated.
Capital was increased by a one-for-two
bonus issue in the 1955 term.
Business has been brisk over the past
year. Outputs at both Geelong and
Kandos have been satisfactory, and the
whole of production has been sold. This
accords with the present bright prospects
prevailing in the building industry.
As an indication of the real earning-
power of the operating-co., all post-war
expansion at Geelong and Kandos has
been financed out of ploughed-back
profits, barring £500,000 raised by a new
share-issue in 1951. And the holding-cos
at the same time have been able to
accumulate a little liquid pin-money as
well. At last balance-day Australian

In 1956 the operating-co. paid a special
dividend of £90,000 each to Australian
Cement and Kandos Cement. It came
from “accumulated profits.” The sum
was applied in taking-up 90,000 £1 shares
in A.P.C. Pty., and made each holding-
co.’s equity two-million shares, including
660,000 bonus-shares received by each
during the term.
The bonus corresponded with a
writing-up by that amount of the A.P.C.
holding in 1955 prior to the bonus-issue
made by Australian Cement to its in-
vesting public, and brings the book-value
of the holding in the operating-co. back
to par.
Australian Cement shares are currently
fetching 675. 6d. on the sharemarket
(Kandos shares brought 675. 6d. also
last week), and at this price the £1 ords.
would yield £2 19s. 3d. p.c. from a 10
p.c. div. Clearly investors are expecting
much better things in the 1961-62 term,
when not only should the enlarged
Kandos plant be yielding bigger profits,
but the need for plough-back should
by then have largely passed.

and rising, concentration on
output of TV-receivers. Up
to the end of March, 1959,
about 637,000 receivers were
produced. Of this total,
334,000 were made in 1958.
Sales had centred in Sydney
and Melbourne, the only cities
with telecasting installations.
In June, 1958, demand reached
a monthly peak of 40,000 sets,
and was followed by the output
of over 41,000 receivers in
July of that year.
This rapid increase in
TV-output caused a fair satura-
tion of Sydney and Melbourne
markets, aggravated by serious
seasonal fluctuations in sales.
Large stocks were accumulated,
and competition became severe,
leading to price-cutting of
various kinds.
The extension of telecasting
facilities to Brisbane and
Adelaide, and introduction of
country TV-stations, should
improve the situation, but it is
unlikely that the 1958 boom
conditions will be repeated.
Population in the two new
centres is smaller. The new
Budget offers very modest
consumption-spending incen-
tives, and the wide hopes for
some sales-tax relief were
unfounded.
The industry’s manufactur-
ing-capacity at present is
400,000 units a year, working
single-shifts, but during the
first quarter of 1959 less than
50 p.c. of capacity was
utilised:

Experience gained in the past
two years resulted in increased
efficiency of production, but
gains in this respect are partly
offset by curtailed output,
which has raised overhead
costs. Diversification of pro-
duction is essential if the firms
concerned wish to play safe.
Pye Industries (the name
was changed from Tecnico in
June this year) manufactures
an impressive range of pro-
ducts: TV-receivers and
radio - receivers, vacuum-
cleaners, tape-recorders and
other domestic and electrical
appliances, sound - systems,
water-pumps and electric-
motors, and distributes elec-
tronic and other products for
the Pye Co. of U.K.
Bendix - Tecnico (Automo-
tive) Pty., a member of the
local Pye group, manufactures
car-carburettors. Recently it
began production of carbur-
rettors for lawn - mowers,
agricultural machinery and
outboard - motors, and of
“pleated - paper” air - intake
filters. Another subsidiary,
F. W. Davey and Co. Pty.,
produces water-pumping
machinery. The group also
manufactures radar, automatic-
pilot and flight-guidance
equipment for the aviation
industry.
A consistent effort is being
made to spread-out the group’s
range of manufacturing activi-
ties, cushioning it as far as
possible from the impact of
fluctuations in TV demand.
However, TV production
has exerted a major influence
on the co.’s earnings. The
1958 TV-spree was largely
responsible for that year’s
record profit of £423,844,
which had done so much to
fill the company’s coffers and
improve its sharemarket
prestige. Of this sum only
£5803 was earned by the sub-
sidiaries.
The drop in TV-sales which
occurred since then is at least
partly to blame for the sharp
reduction in profits for the
year ended March 31, 1959:

profit. After taking - off
£10,250 for the unchanged
pref.-div. charge, the showing
on ordinary capital was
£250,008 (34.5 p.c.).
The management’s cautious
approach to the future is
expressed in the raising of the
ord. div.-rate from 5 p.c. to
7 p.c. only for the year,
absorbing £50,785. Reserves
benefited by £199,223 of the
year’s profit, and £9767 of
premiums came in on shares
issued to the new minority
interests in the group.
Although it is unlikely that
there will be a return to the
preceding year’s level of
profits, there are no grounds
to suppose that the 1958-59
rate of earnings cannot be
maintained. However, the
burden of income-earning will
probably continue to be borne
by the parent, for it is diffi-
cult to see how the subsidiaries
can, at this stage, materially
increase their contribution to
the group’s profits.
Capital-structure has not
changed, and no new share-
or note-capital was raised
during the year.
The formation of a new
subsidiary, Bendix - Tecnico
(Automotive) Pty., Ltd., in
association with Solex, Ltd.,
and Zenith Carburettor Co.,
of England, to take-over the
manufacturing activities of
Bendix-Tecnico Pty., resulted

Land and buildings went up
by £43,442. Book-value of

rate at which depreciation is
provided for. Stocks increased
by £96,498 to £1,388,404 and
book-debts by £56,494 to
£899,938, suggesting that turn-
over is being maintained.
Liquidity was further improved
by a £212,200 increase in cash
balances. Current ratio is 1.7.
Net assets backing works-out
at £1 14s. per 20s. ord.
On the whole, the balance-
sheet supports the directors’
view that the last year was a
period of consolidation.
The market, which puts its
own value on assets and
earning-power, offers 425. a

Swans, Ltd.
Cwans, in N.S.W., enjoyed
a period of steady progress
and consolidation during the
year ended May 31, 1959,
reflecting the even expansion
taking piace in the building
and allied industries.
In spite of considerable com-
petition, the demand for
builders’ hardware was well
maintained, and the company
increased its earnings appre-
ciably. The migration - intake
target for the current Budget
year has been raised by 10,000,
and this improves Swans’
prospects for 1959-60.
The branch-stores, located in
Hurstville, Chatswood and
Parramatta (all Sydney
suburbs), and in the thriving
industrial city of Wollongong,
on the South Coast of N.S.W.,
traded busily and profitably.

and building in general is in-
creasing, mostly in areas where
the co. has set-up branches.
The board’s quiet confidence
in the co.’s growth is shown
by the manner of the creation
of a substantial provision for
retirement and long - service
leave benefits for the manag-
ing-director and employees.
The provision now stands at
£51,375, and was created by
transferring £26,375 from the
amount previously set aside
for contingencies and £25,000
from undistributed profits
accumulated to June 1, 1955.

After £10,921 was provided for
depreciation (up £4209), and
£62,000 for taxation (pre-
viously not disclosed), net
profit increased by £12,727 to
£103,347, which is equivalent
to an earning-rate of 14.6 p.c.
on average ord. capital, com-
pared with 16 p.c. in the pre-
ceding year. The dividend was
kept at 10 p.c., and reserves
benefited from the leftovers, as
well as from a £1975 profit on
the sale of shares.

the impression of steady and
deliberate development over

From Herbert Holman
Tf, as seems likely, the general
election takes place in
October, the Parliament which
is now in recess is virtually at
the end of its life.
At the close of a trouble-
laden period of four-and-a-
half years the situation is
something of a paradox, for,
while the Government stands
high in public esteem, opinion
of Parliament has slipped
lower. Inspired and fearless
leadership has brought the
country’s economy round from,
crisis and galloping inflation to
booming prosperity, but the
nation’s elected legislators have,
for the most part, failed to
commend themselves either to
the public or to the press.
Chiefly this is because the
House of Commons, so far
from being the place where
policies are shaped or decisions
of Government reached, has
instead deteriorated into a
cockpit for point-scoring. Here
the Opposition, lacking a feas-
ible programme and sensitive
to every Conservative achieve-
ment, is largely responsible. But
there are other depreciatory
tendencies. The power of the
Whips is too forbidding ; both
parties are inclined to en-
courage the yes-men and sup-
press the individualist; and at
question-time Ministers are
more and more prone to
develop the technique of find-
ing a cynical way to gloss-over
a question without answering
it.
Nevertheless, among the 55
Government bills of the
session, considerable headway
has been made in social reform.
This is consistent with the
' character of the Home Sec-
retary, Mr. Butler (although
his liberal intentions are often
belied by a mannerism of
casual detachment which in-
furiates the House). The most
important is the Mental Health
Bill, up-to-date in thought and
far-reaching in legislative
reform. Others are the Street
Offences Act (though open to
the criticism that because of
timidity it stops short of justice
and ignores the Wolfenden
Report recommendations on
homosexuality); the Obscene
Publications Act, a private bill,
which seeks to clarify the pub-
lication of serious works ; and
the Legitimacy Act, to which'
the House of Lords, after
jibbing at the legitimatising of
children of adulterous parents
who subsequently married, had
to give second thoughts and
recant.
The closing debates on
Africa, before the House rose,
were particularly stormy, with
the Opposition out for blood.
It was rather wasted energy,
for the Government speakers
stood their ground well, emerg-
ing with some credit; and,
with holidays pending and
other more pressing issues
nearer home, public interest
generally was slight.
Loose Change
The rush of bids and mergers
seems to be a direct conse-
quence of the credit-relaxation.
Most of them are in the normal
way of business ; few are take-
overs.
It is believed that the
Treasury is studying the appli-
cation of a capital-gains tax,
not with the idea of securing
a rake-off from the normal
investor, but with a view to in-
hibiting the operations of the
clever manipulator who pro-
motes companies solely for
capital-appreciation.
Speculators, able to get
credit easily, have been very
active in property-shares. Many
have already burned their
fingers. Others are having lo
hold on to stocks which have
disappointingly refused to
appreciate.
Industrial output is rising at
the rate of 5 to 6 per cent, a
year, compared with six
months ago. In the six years
since 1953, output has risen by
20 per cent. —that is, by 3 per
cent, a year. This is lower than
most European countries but
higher than the United States.
The stability of prices over
the past eighteen months may
be illusory. Since food prices
have much to do with the com-
pilation of the index, this may
have been disproportionately
affected by the cheaper food-
stuffs available in the super-
markets which have been
springing-up everywhere. There
is little tendency otherwise for
prices to come down. When
manufacturers can cut costs
(as they should be able to do
as they approach capacity) they
tend to increase their profit-
margins.
A Government-inspired cam-
paign for lower prices may
follow in the autumn. For these
reasons: companies, takeover-
wary, are allocating more to
dividends ; profits generally are
increasing ; newer methods and
fuller capacity make for more
economical working. These
factors and the general atmo-
sphere of boom will naturally
let loose a flood of wage-
claims. The only way these
can be tempered with modera-
tion (for it is acknowledged
that the worker has a right to
share prosperity) is for prices
to come down. Otherwise, the
old galloping wages-costs in-
flation will threaten us again.


Hear what the
man says
By PETER WARD
They saw the black sedan
smashed head - on
against a tree halfway
to the bottom of a gully
below the mountain road.
They made their way through
the gaping safety-fence down
the slope to within a dozen
paces from the wreck, pausing
on a level strip of ground
when they saw the man,
hunched-up over the steering-
wheel.
Roy asked in a frightened
whisper “What’ll we do,
Charlie?’’ v
“I aunno,” Charlie said, his
voice hushed. “I’ll have a
look at him.”
He went over to the car
and made a furtive examina-
tion. He got the picture of
a man with a bloody face, his
head resting on the steering-
wheel, the face turned towards
the open window; the man
dressed in a blood-splattered
white shirt, dark pants ; blood
and broken glass ; and the man
very still with his eyes closed.
Roy came forward a few
paces. “Is he dead?”
Charlie turned his back on
the wreck and walked over to
Roy. “He might be. If he
isn’t, he hasn’t got far to go.”
“Maybe we oughta get him
out of there,” Roy suggested.
“If we could manage it. You
think we could manage it,
Charlie?”
“He’s a pretty big sort of
a feller, from what I could
see of him,” Charlie said.
Then he assured Roy: “We
could get him out all right if
we had to, but if he’s still alive
something might happen if we
move him. He might haemor-
rhage or something like that.
We’ll leave him just like we
found him.”
That was o.k. with Roy.
He didn’t really want to touch
the man. He said “Well,
maybe I better go back to that
town we went through yester-
day. Sullywood, wasn’t it?
Get an ambulance or some-
thing, eh?”
“Okay, I’ll wait here?”
Roy looked up at the road.
“Might get a lift.”
“Bit early for that.”
Tt was shortly after dawn,
around six o’clock. They
had broken camp half-an-hour
before and intended having
their first meal of the day, as
usual on this trip, about 10.
Charlie reckoned it out.
“You’ve got a four-mile hike
back to Sullywood. If you
have to walk all the way, it’ll
take you an hour-and-a-half,
two hours.”
“I’ll hurry.” Roy let the
pack slip from his shoulders.
“You’ll be all right, Charlie?”
Charlie looked pained.
“Aw, you know what I
mean, Charlie. I mean, say
something happens to this
feller? Like, you know how
it is with some people when
they’re sick or hurt? You
know. And if this feller’s still
alive he might start throwing
himself around, or some-
thing . . . Know what I mean,
Charlie?”
Charlie jerked his thumb at
the wreck. “Him? Throw
himself around? Take a good
look at him, Roy.”
“I can see him. I’ll be
going, then.” He started up
the slope. “I’ll hurry, Charlie.”
“That’s all right. Take your
time.”
Charlie watched Roy until
he was out of sight beyond
the shoulder of the road ; then
he picked-up Roy’s pack and
carried it up the slope to the
base of a large boulder about
20ft. from the car. He
removed his own pack and sat
down with his back to the
packs and looked at the car.
All he had to do now was
wait.
Charlie was beginning to
feel cramped and cold when
he heard a groan from the car.
He "stood up and went over
to the wreck and looked in at
the man.
The man’s head still rested
on the steering-wheel. His
eyes were open, and he stared
at Charlie through the open
window.
Charlie said casually “G’day
. . . How do you feel, mister?”
The man just stared at him
and Charlie didn’t know if he
had been heard or not, so he
tried again.
“Can you hear me? I said
how do you feel?”
The man said “This wasn’t
an accident. I was run off the
road.”
He didn’t say it straight-out,
like that. That’s how he
meant to say it, but the words
were slurred and came from
his throat because his tongue
and lips were sluggish. But
Charlie could understand him
well enough.
His eyes closed, and Charlie
thought that he must have
passed out. Then he saw the
lips moving silently. The eyes
flickered open and the words
started to come hesitantly:
“Listen. Listen, you. I want
you . . . tell listen.” His
voice was getting stronger and
his brow was furrowed in his
anxiety to hold Charlie’s
attention.
Charlie looked down into
the gully, away from the face.
He didn’t like looking.
The man pleaded, “Listen.
I might, mightn’t be able . . .
tell. If . . . don’t listen.”
Charlie looked into his eyes.
The man was very afraid and
troubled. His eyes were wide
and staring with the urgency
of what he wanted to say,
making his eyebrows stand out
high on his forehead.
Charlie asked impatiently
“Listen to what? What’s up?”
“The one did this. His
name’s Geoff. Geoff Gallo-
way.”
Charlie looked blankly at
him.
The man gasped “Say it!
Geoff Galloway.”
“Okay. Geoff Galloway.”
Then the man gave his own
name, but Charlie couldn’t
understand him. He didn’t
bother to ask the man to repeat
it. It didn’t matter to Charlie.
“This Galloway. Lives in
Sullywood. Sullywood. Third
on the left ”
“Sullywood. Yeah.”
“Barbara. She’ll . . . but
she mightn’t tell them. Police.
She . . . what you’ve got to
listen.”
He told Charlie how it was,

flow smoothly into unconscious-
ness —then back again. Over
and over.
I began to think poorly of
modern youth, toyed hysteri-
cally with the idea of writing
a Letter to the Papers,
dropped-off, jerked back! A
bad time. Then, more sen-
sibly, I picked a different
carriage. I was well on the
way to becoming a regular
traveller. -
Not that I always sleep.
There are other fascinating
possibilities. One can read a
book; it is really surprising
the amount of reading that
can be done in a week, four
hours a day ; although, strictly
speaking, the hour on the bus,
consisting of two half-hours
morning and evening, doesn’t
count as full reading-time.
The bus is a bit jerky, and,
taken all round, it is more
satisfactory to use the bus-
time in sleeping.
Or one can simply look out
the windows and think, an
exercise most city workers get
little time for. Or study
fellow-passengers.
At Riverstone, further down
the line, there are less
seats available, but the torrent
of pretty girls, flowing into the
train, flow, generally, in pre-
dictable directions.
A few men get out here to
go to work at the meatworks,
presumably, and a lot of
young girls get in.
Riverstone is best known in
commercial circles for its
meatworks, but in my mind
is inseparably associated with
the morning invasion of girls.
Remarkably pretty girls,
laughing and bubbling at that
grim hour, and any one of
them is welcome to sit on my
knee if she can’t find a seat;
well-built, and therefore heavy,
as most of them undoubtedly
are.
However, so far it hasn’t
been necessary.
of the fascinating things
about Sydney over the past
few years has been the de-
velopment, under a superficial
skin of uniformity—accent,
petrol-stations, pubs of
regional differences. A symp-
tom of quick growth, perhaps,
helped along by concentrations
of New Australians in certain
districts: in which case the
same yeast must be working
to similar shapes in other
capital cities.
Or, perhaps, the differences
were there all the time, in some
measure, but weren’t detected.
Coming from the bush, early
fixing on The Cross as a place
to live and seldom straying
far from it, can result in a
rather narrow view of Sydney.
The Cross is a charming
place, and its inhabitants,
with a few atrocious excep-
tions, are among the most
civilised in Australia ; but, like
other self-sufficient communi-
ties —like, for instance, the
ancient Athenians and the
modern Parisians —they tend to
think of folk from farther out
as barbarians; or, at least,
“What does this button do ?”
they think any suburb more
remote than Double Bay a
barbarous distance from the
hub of things—that is to say,
The Cross.
I distinctly remember my
horror, after a couple of years’
residence there, on discovering
at a party that I was expected
to escort a girl to darkest
Epping. Yet I came from a
part of the country where a
50-mile drive to a dance was
considered a normal prelimin-
ary to a night’s entertainment.
~vtot, be it understood, that
I’m knocking The Cross.
No, indeed. If you have to
live in Sydney, by all means
live at The Cross. Grose Vale,
properly speaking, isn’t even
ultima-Sydney—it’s clear out-
side the County of Cumber-
land, on the other side of the
Hawkesbury River, in Colo
Shire —so a comparison isn’t
necessary.
Still, coming to The Grose
from The Cross, certain con-
trasts are striking; for
instance, transport. You can
get to the city from The
Cross in minutes. From Grose
Vale, if you know your con-
nections, it takes two hours.
For years I have been telling
anyone who would listen about
the superiority of The Cross
to other Sydney residential
areas, and how undeserved is
its reputation for wickedness,
and I have no desire to recant
now ; nor, indeed, need.
In retrospect, something can
be said even for those excep-
tions to the general virtue of
its inhabitants mentioned —
certainly I have never resented
being exploited at The Cross
quite so hotly as I have in
other, more smug, areas. The
exceptions, 1 by the very energy
of their rapacity, contribute to
the sparkle of the place,
quicken the general pulse.
Even villainy, it seems,
burns there with a purer flame
than in the suburbs.
'T'here is precious little
villainy, I suspect, around
Grose Vale, but it has other
advantages: a view from the
back-door of a sweep of
timbered country and the gap
in the mountains where the
Grose River, that swift and
surprising stream, a flash of
silver against the burning rock
in summer, swoops down to
join the Hawkesbury; the
morning mist, and the same,
but vastly different, scene at
night, with a fat moon sailing
over the dark battalions of
trees, lighting up the western
wall of rock and forest; little
jewelled birds performing acro-
batics on the dew-jewelled
clothesline, the smell of wet
leaves and earth and wood-
fires, and a deep quietness.
It’s not all that all the time,
of course. It gets hot in
summer, and the dust from
the unsealed Grose Wold road
hits our little humpy in evil
clouds, driving wives wild ;
or it rains and rains, and the
road is a bog ; or the wester-
lies bend the trees and snatch
sheets from the line and rattle
and shake the little house.
At such times The Cross
seems civilised indeed. The
ideal, perhaps, would be a
bite of each —a satisfying
sandwich of Sydney and The
Bush. For, rightly or wrongly,
The Cross represents resi-
dential Sydney, and Grose
Vale seems as close to The
Bush as it is possible to get
and still work in the city.
But the great majority of
people who catch the Rich-
mond train have their per-
manent homes along the line
and go to the city to work.
The line, for me, starts up the
road a bit, where the bus is
parked outside one of the
three Duffy homes.
The bus leaves at a few
minutes to 6 a.m., which is
plenty dark in winter morn-
ings and middling cold. In
this household, for various
reasons, including my incur-
able slowness, the day starts
a good deal earlier, with a
blast of disk-jockey cheerful-
ness from the radio, a cuppa
and the fire crackling in the
fuel-stove; before that, one
is hardly awake, an automa-
ton groping around.
The disk-jockey has the
most deplorable taste in
music, giving us all the Wind-
sor Boys’ favorites and, worse,
every morning, a nerve-
jangling piece called “Alvin's
Harmonica.” He also gives-
out cheerio-calls to nurses,
W.R.A.N.S., garbage-collec-
tors, “the boys at Head-
quarters Switch,” and the
water-police (to whom, with
unwearying humor, he refers
as “the fishermen”) ; but he
also gives the time, so we
suffer him ; time, at this end
of the journey, is of the
essence.
TYTOt that George, or Laurie,
who drive on this early
run to Richmond, wouldn’t
give a man a few minutes’
grace ; they would. But there
are other passengers waiting,
and the train to catch ; and,
around this time, the minutes
fly.
Wash, shave, dress, eat; one
ear cocked for the time. There
are, of course, clocks and
watches, but the spirit of the
place has got into them. They
don’t seem to care a damn
about the time.

who send their men off to work
without breakfast. Not this
wife. In fact, if she didn’t
supervise every movement I
probably wouldn’t get off at
all. She does supervise, briskly,
and fills me up with hot food,
followed by hot tea (second
session), and, lately, just be-
fore I step out into the dark
morning, a stiff rum. The
excuse is a cold I’ve been nurs-
ing, and the weather, but I'm
becoming used to it, beginning
to wonder whether I will be
able to do without it . . .
Anyway, it is with a pleasant
feeling of numbness that I get
into the bus, light a cigarette.
I’m the first passenger, so
I have a choice of seats. I
always pick the same seat,
second from the driver, right-
hand side. Things are so
highly organised now that I
always have a few minutes be-
fore the driver, George or
Laurie, and Don, who goes as
far as the depot to pick up
another bus, climb in.
There is a light on in Laurie’s
house, another in Don’s, the
third house, Mark’s, is in
darkness. Mark and his two
sons (although the Duffys
themselves, sensibly, live at
Grose Vale) started this ser-
vice, which radiates in several
directions from Richmond.
They started it seven years
ago, and they give a very
good service.
Also, although they have had
no formal training as car-
penters, the Duffy boys have
built a number of houses
around these parts, including
their own and their parents’.
They are married, and each
has a daughter, 18 months old
at time of writing, Don’s
daughter two weeks younger
than Laurie’s. Mark Duffy is
a Colo Shire councillor, cap-
tain of the Grose Vale bush-
fire-brigade and, generally, a
leading citizen.
or Laurie switches
on the engine, and then,
usually, I go to sleep, cleverly
waking as the bus pulls-up at
Richmond Station.
The Man From Kurmond
is sitting in the seat nearest
the door left-hand side, and
sometimes, for the hell of it,
I try to beat him to the door.
This is of more importance
on Monday mornings, when
workers’ weeklies are bought,
than on other occasions, but,
in any case, it probably isn’t
very important.
Still, it gives a sporting fillip
to the day ; so, every now and
again, if not too burdened with
equipment (typewriter, etc.), I
give it a try. I have won
twice.
In summer, though, when it
is light, it is worth while stay-
ing awake for the 11 miles to
Richmond. The road twists
and turns, and sparkling valleys
and hillsides of orchard, forest
and pasture unfold beside it;
there is a sparkle in the air
and it feels good to be alive.
Maybe the feeling won’t last
beyond Windsor, it may
vanish before, at East Rich-
mond or Clarendon, when
sleepiness catches-up, but for
this period it is irresistible,
Through Kurrajong—a pretty
village not to be confused
with Kurrajong Heights—up
along the Bell’s Line of road,

with its Keylined pastures and
sleek black cattle—and along
the flats to Richmond town

edge of the window, my face
on my hand, and go to sleep.

wake until Redfern. But even
if I’m not tired I usually have

of the journey,

“my Eyes Have a Cold Hose”
A familiar sight to the
crowds who stream
out of the George-
street exit from Syd-
ney’s Wynyard railway-station
each morning is a young
woman striding confidently
along and holding firmly to the
harness of an alert-looking dog.
Like everyone else in the
hurrying crowd the two are
on their way to work. The girl
isn’t leading the dog, and the
dog isn’t really leading her,
though, being a thoroughly
trained guide-dog, it is guiding
her, shielding her and allowing
her to use its eyes to replace
her own, which are sightless.
The two are an excellent
example of the perfectly co-
ordinated partnership of dog
and human which it is the aim
of the Guide Dogs for the
Blind Association to foster.
There is nothing essentially
new in the concept of the blind
man and his dog, but the
modem movement to train
dogs specifically to act as the
eyes of the blind goes back
not much more than 40 years.
In 1916 Dr. Stahling, of
Oldenberg, in Germany,
founded a school for this pur-
pose. His dogs, which were
primarily for the use of war-
blinded soldiers, were Alsa-
tians. About 10 years later an
American woman, Mrs. Eustis,
herself a trainer of dogs (for
police- and Army-work), was
so impressed by the Stahling
school that she wrote an
article which she entitled “The
Seeing Eye.” When this was
published in the “Saturday
Evening Post” a young
American, Morris Frank, who
had lost his sight, asked if she
could train a dog for him.
With the help of the Stahling
school she trained a guide-dog
at her own school in Switzer-
land.
The sequel was remarkable.
Man and dog returned to
America to start the Seeing
Eye Organisation at Morriston,
New Jersey, and Mrs. Eustis
established in Switzerland a
school for guide-dog trainers.
One of the first men to
graduate from this school was
Nicholai Liakhoff, a former
captain in a Cossack regiment,
who in time became the first
Director of Guide Dog Train-
ing in England.
npwo people, one of them
blind, one sighted, were
responsible for bringing the
guide-dog movement to Aus-
tralia. Arnold Cook, a Perth
man who lost his sight at 18
but despite that disability
graduated B.A. at the Univer-
sity of W.A. and won a
scholarship to the London
School of Economics, acquired
a guide-dog while in England.
This was a black Labrador
trained by Betty Bridge, who
was herself trained by Liakhoff.
When Cook returned to Aus-
tralia to become lecturer in
Economics at the University
of W.A., he brought his guide-
dog “Dreena” with him.
Some time later Cook and
other blind people in Perth
persuaded Miss Bridge to
establish a guide-dog training-
centre in Perth.
The first dog trained in
Perth—“Beau”—is described
Sydney barrister Ivan Cribb and his guide-dog “Shann.”
by his owner, Mrs. Meade,
public-relations officer of the
association, as “a neat, com-
pact, black dog of indeter-
minate ancestry,” but he is
considered to rank with the
world’s best in his vocation.
Most of the dogs now
trained at the kennels at Bel-
mont, near Perth, are Labra-
dors or puppies of a Labrador-
Kelpie cross.
Training takes about four
months, and only about one
dog in every four graduates.
There are no second-class
passes at this school ; only full
marks are good enough.
The dog has to be taught to
walk with the leash and
harness ; to stop at each kerb ;
the proper way to negotiate
stairs ; to avoid obstacles ; to
cross intersections with the
flow of traffic ; the technique
of halving the crossing of a
wide street, stopping in the
middle until traffic on the far
side has passed.
TX7hen the dog has passed its
tests, its education is by no
means finished. It has learnt to
guide a man, but it is destined
to guide one particular man—-
or woman. Moreover, the man
the dog is to guide for the rest
of its working life has to be
trained, too. An applicant for
a guide-dog must satisfy the
association that he is a fit and
proper person to become an
owner, that he can maintain it
and care for it and give it a
good home. He must go into
residence at the training-centre
so that he and the dog can be
moulded into a properly func-
tioning team. This usually
takes about four weeks and at
the end of that period man and
dog are ready to tackle life ill
the man’s own town. The
guide-dog is supplied to the
applicant free of charge, but
his new owner may, if he
pleases, make a donation
towards cost of air-fare or
other expenses.
Up to the present all Aus-
tralian guide-dogs have been
trained in Perth, but the
school is now to be moved to
the eastern States, where the
greatest demand now lies.
The transfer from Perth to
the new training-centre will be
made as soon as funds are
available ; it is hoped to make
the move this year or early
next year.
It costs £5OO to train
a guide-dog, and last year the
Perth centre trained and
delivered 16. It is expected
that future applications, plus
replacements—the working life
of a guide-dog is about 10
years—will require the train-
ing of 25 dogs a year. Till
now the people of Westralia
have borne almost the whole
cost of guide-dog training, but
a drive is now being made in
all States to raise funds for
the new training-centre.
HThe Guide Dogs for the
Blind Association of
N.S.W. has organised an
appeal with a target of £40,000
in the next three years to pay
for the State’s share of the cost
of the new centre and to pro-
vide a dog-credit of £lOOO and
yearly expenses of £4OOO to
£5OOO. Under the chairmanship
of W. M. Gollan, M.L.A., a
campaign-committee of 300
businessmen is conducting a
personal canvass for donations.
Contributions may be paid in
a lump sum or spread over two
or three years. Gifts to this
cause are allowable as deduc-
tions for income-tax purposes.
Donations may be sent to

Up And Coming consoli-
dated his position as Epsom
favorite by winning the Canter-
bury Stakes at odds-on last
Saturday, in close to race-
record time. Some race-
followers, however, thought
the New Zealander should
have won more convincingly.
Gold Stakes was an absentee
through meeting with a slight
mishap at Randwick a few
hours earlier. Jack Green,
trainer of Gold Stakes, was
keen to start that flyer, but
was represented by another
smart galloper, Cornelius,
winner of a number of sprints
in good company, though not
considered in the same class as
Up And Coming or Gold
Stakes. As it happened,
Cornelius ran a great race and
almost brought off a surprise.
Grey Ghost was third, but at
no stage did he look like beat-
ing the other pair. Still, he’s
not a good Canterbury horse,
and the run was fair enough
to suggest that he should soon
win one.
• • • •
The Canterbury Stakes run
should further improve Up And
Coming; he will be better
suited from now on at a mile
or further —he has won at up
to If mile. His next outing
may be in the Warwick Stakes
at Warwick Farm next Satur-
day week, and that should
certainly indicate his Epsom
chance.
• • • •
New Zealand owners of
Verve, Sir James and J. C.
Fletcher, made a shrewd move
in sending the five-year-old
mare to Sydney to be trained
by Frank Dalton. Her win
in the Canterbury Park August
Handicap was her third from
five starts here. On Saturday,
in beating outsider Globous
and Turkis Don, she covered
the 9y furlongs in 1.59, a
fraction outside the race
record. Too much use was
made of Dagger in an attempt
to try him out as a middle-
distance horse. His four wins
have been over sprint courses.
Rosebery trainer Bland
Beck, who won the Second
Canterbury Park Ashbury
Stakes with Merry Inn, raced
by his wife, expected also to
land the Three-year-old
Handicap with another of his
team, Merry Liz. However,
the filly got into a bit of a
scrimmage early and didn’t
settle down to the real task
until a couple of furlongs had
been covered. She ran on
strongly over the final stages,
and managed third-money, a
performance which pointed to
success over a mile or so. Beck
is hoping Merry Liz will prove
a staying filly as the season
advances ; to date she hasn’t
been tried beyond 7\ furlongs,
but that applies to many other
three-year-olds. The filly is by
Rego (imp.), sire of Wiggle
and a son of Nasrullah, noted
sire in England and in America.
Dam of the three-year-old,
“She says Washing first —spearfishing after!”
Sweet Spray, is by Cold
Shower from Sweet ' Air by
Air Balloon (imp.), and traces
back to Prince Foote, who 50
years back won the Melbourne
Cup.
One of the fastest gallopers
on the Rosebery training-track,
four-year-old Royal Pastime
has failed to act to his early-
morning flashes, but he went
close to it in the Third Ash-
bury Stakes at Canterbury,
being beaten half-a-head by
Double Brace, with the third
horse, Jabin, five lengths away.
On the training-track the geld-
ing had been recording times
considered good enough to win
Flying Handicaps, and certainly
Mel Schumacher had to ride
Double Brace hard to gain the
verdict.

Owner E. I. Cavanagh had
a minor win in a Hawkesbury
Three-year-old Maiden with
Persian Sands, brother to
Prince Darius. He paid
4000gns. for the youngster
at the Randwick yearling-sales
last year. Bred by Jack
Mandel, the colt is likely to
now go on to much better
things. He’s by Persian Book
(imp.) from Lyrical Lass by St.
Andrew from Gozoni by Lo
Zingaro (imp.).
Stan Davidson, now a New-
castle trainer and owner, and
meeting with a fair measure of
success, will be recalled as a
crack jockey, who did particu-
larly well as an apprentice. On
one day at Newcastle in 1927
he rode five winners and a
third. He’s owner-trainer of
four - year - old Hawkesbury
Maiden Seven winner Apple
Law, who’s by Apple Jack
from Currency Lass by Drum
Net or Clayton from Lawlove
by Law Maker (imp.).*

First day of the Warwick
Farm spring meeting next
Saturday should bring together
most of the best three-year-
olds in the £1550 Hobartville
Stakes, run over seven furlongs,
with colts and geldings carry-
ing 8.10 and fillies 8.5. It
could throw some advance
light on the Derby, as the
£l3OO Campbelltown Handi-
cap (six furlongs) and the
August Handicap (11 furlongs)
may do on the Epsom and
Metropolitan.

Over the past year leading
race-clubs didn’t do much good
financially. The Sydney Turf
Club, which had a surprising
25,500 attendance at" Canter-
bury on Saturday, made a
profit of £7919, but it registered
a fall in revenue of £86,012,
and the profit was £16,211
below that of the previous
season. However, prizemoney
was increased by £7983 in the
12 months ended June 30, and
for 48 meetings the club dis-
tributed £371,201 in prizes and
sweepstakes. Totalisator turn-
over was increased, mostly
through the experimental
seven all-tote fixtures. Doubles-
tote returns dropped heavily.

Form at the Valley
From a racing angle, the
programme at Moonee Valley
last Saturday represented the
tail-end of winter. Very few,
if any, of the horses that raced
at the little track will have any-
thing to do with the important
events of the next three months.
Possible exceptions were the
placegetters in the first division
of the mile Tullamarine Handi-
cap—Top Fred, Tudor Hill and
Regal Wench, who finished in
that order. Most punters
looked to Tudor Hill to win,
and on all that he has shown
in the past the race was made
to order for him. The distance
was right, the going was soggy,
as he likes it, and with 9.4 he

was well weighted for a horse
that had won the Doncaster
with 8.11. After having been
at the tail of the field early,
Tudor Hill made a half-hearted
attempt to run-down Top Fred
in the straight, but the aged
Frederick John gelding was un-
troubled to win by four lengths.
Some punters gave voice to a
stupid demonstration against Ron
Hutchinson, rider of Tudor Hill,
but the reason for the Ottoman
horse’s bad run was possibly that
his long autumn (in Sydney) and
winter (in Brisbane) campaigns
have had their effect. Top Fred
has moved up in Caulfield Cup
discussions, but it is not likely that
the aged gelding is a better galloper
now than he was two years ago,
when he failed in Tulloch’s Caul-
field Cup. The five-year-old mare
Regal Wench, who finished two
lengths behind Tudor Hill, has had
admirers for the Cups, but on
Saturday’s run she is not much
above winter class.
Miasma, winner at 33 to 1
of the first division of the Ailsa
Handicap (for three-year-old
fillies, run over the 6 furlongs
less' 20yds. course), is by
Meadow Mist from Lady
Amana, and wears her sire’s
typical grey coat. She showed
the pace of her breed to bo
always well placed, and a share
of courage to fight on when it
looked as if Flying Rocket had
her measure in the straight.
There was not much quality in
any of the runners, but both
the winner and Flying Rocket
(who did not have the best of
runs) could score before the
good-class fillies race again.
• • • •
The warm favorite, Summer
Queen, took the second Ailsa.
Back in March this filly by
Sun Storm from Sunfast had
shown a liking for heavy
ground by winning at Fleming-
ton when the track was hock-
deep in mud, and she had no
trouble to handle the Valley’s
rain-soaked course. The filly’s
win justified Pakenham
trainer Ray Webster’s decision
to give the mount on Summer
Queen to his young apprentice,
Jeff Jean, who has looked after
her ever since she entered
Webster’s stable. The lad had
not previously won a metro-
politan race (in fact, his only
other winning ride was at
Moe), but the Valley crowd
showed their respect for Web-
ster’s confidence in the boy by
sending Summer Queen out at
2-to-l, and, for his part, the
lad handled her very well.
Former N.Z. jockey Keith
Nuttall, back after a long dis-
qualification, showed at the
Valley that, given the mounts,
he will finish well up on the
jockeys’ list in Melbourne.
When Nuttall first shifted here
his style of riding was severely
criticised by local racing-
writers, but this page more
than once affirmed that he was
really first-class. He rode a
double at the Valley, the first
of them, Kent, who took the
Morang Handicap, a mile
event for three-year-old colts
and geldings.
One of the many horses owner
W. R. Kemball has bought in New
Zealand, Kent is by Lord’s sire,
Targui, from Granada. It was
a first win for Kent, who has had
his share of chances in the past,
and even then, it was Nuttall’s
strength that won the day. In
third place was favorite Sir Emblem,
who impressed this writer a few
weeks back as a Derby hope, but
Sir Emblem has been kept racing
week after week with big weights,
and it is unlikely now that he
could be freshened-up for the spring
racing.
Nuttall’s second winner was
Chatoul, in the 13-furlongs
Ngarveno Handicap, and it
certainly looked as if Nuttall’s
control made a difference to
the six-year-old Chateau
Roussel-Lady Helios gelding
—on the previous Saturday
Chatoul finished last in the
two-miles Malakoff Stakes at
Caulfield.
* * *
Spring comes to Melbourne
racing next Saturday with the
running of the J. J. Liston
Stakes, a w.-f.-a. event over
seven furlongs. Included in
nominations were Lord, Sir
Blink, Chicola and Lord
Gavin, a quartette of classic or
w.-f.-a. winners. N.Z. galloper
Routine is an interesting entry,
and there is a good supporting
cast of three-year-olds and
top-class handicap winners.
Main interest will centre on
Lord’s running. Last spring
he was outstanding in the
shorter scale events, and he
has galloped well enough on
the track to suggest he will
be just as good this season.
He should win the Liston, but
the form of some of the other
runners will have a bearing
on Cups’ discussions.
* * *
Premier Bolte gave a blunt
“No! ” to a renewed appeal by the
Victorian Trainers’ Association for
the restoration of mid-week racing
in Melbourne. The trainers’ case
is that such racing was suspended
as a war-time measure, and that
it is unfair to those who work in
the racing-business to retain emer-
gency conditions for so long.
Bolte has expressed two objections:
fear of absenteeism, and the possible
effect on country racing-clubs.
Both arguments seem weak. Attend-
ance at a mid-week meeting in
Melbourne would range from
10,000 to 12,000, and of these a
considerable number would com-
prise that section of the racing-
world which lives by taking in
each other’s washing, and the bulk
of the remainder would be shift-
workers and housewives. The
strong provincial racing-clubs
would not be gravely affected by
week-day racing in the city (their
fixtures could be arranged to avoid
clashing with the city programmes),
and the myriad of small clubs
would be all the better for a series
of amalgamations.
AAA
The annual report of the V.R.C.
shows a deficit on last financial
year’s operations of £836, which
does not appear to read well com-
pared to the previous year’s sur-
plus of £10,589. However, the
club attributes the adverse result
to heavy building-expenditure,
plus the £3223 which was its share
of the expense involved in present-
ing the metropolitan racing-clubs’
case before the Royal Commission
on off-course betting. The report
shows that the new Lawn grand-
stand cost £361,261, towards which
the V.R.C. provided £280,000 from
its reserve funds, which are now
down to £12,555. The senior club
is satisfied with attendance-figures
last year, described as “steady.”

The Trots
Despite bitter weather for it,
the opening of the new
season’s trotting at Harold
Park drew a 17,000 crowd on
Saturday night, when top-class
Victorian Don’t Enquire,
winner of a string of races last
season, was little troubled to
notch the Trotters’ Handicap
from the 60yd.-mark. Taking
the lead early in the second lap,
he was chased home by Lucky
Vale and Shellgrit.
The three Qualifying Stakes
were respectively won by
Satin Royal, Royal Guest and
Craig Hanover. Taking a tip
from the visit of Princess
Alexandra, punters plunged
successfully on Royal Guest,
who was taken to the front by
W. Picken nearing the home-
turn to win comfortably by
two lengths. Picken also drove
Craig Hanover to collect the
first winning double of the
season. Craig Hanover dis-
proved his stable nickname
(Lazybones) by leading
throughout, to upset a confi-
dent plunge on the only odds-
on favorite of the night, Anya,
who broke badly and was never
a possibility.
Driver George Hall was
taken unconscious to hospital
following a bad smash in the
Harold Park Handicap. Two
drivers were thrown heavily,
and four of the 12 starters
failed to complete the course.
The race went to Flingo (L.
Moulds), beating New Zea-
lander Guiseppe and Doyen.
Flingo was making his run to
take the lead when the acci-
dent happened. Guiseppe,
nearly brought down at this
stage, lost several lengths, but
came again and failed by only
a neck to catch the hard-driven
Flingo.

N.Z. fullback Don Clarke,
who won the first Rugby
Union Test against the British
Isles by his goalkicking, was
the hero of N.Z.’s 11-8 win in
the second Test at Wellington
Athletic Field on Saturday. This
time he scored the winning try in
the last couple of minutes. N.Z.
led 6-0 (two tries) at half-time, but
British Isles overtook in the second
half, and appeared to have the
game in hand till Clarke added his
eleventh-hour five points. N.Z. did
most of the attacking, and deserved
to win. The crowd numbered
around 60,000, and a good fe\V
thousand more, after staging a near-
riot, saw the game through ripped-
off pickets and knocked-down
fences.
Randwick again proved its right
to top position in Sydney Rugby
Union by toppling North 17-12.
Though the result of the game was
in doubt nearly to the end, ’Wick
would have been most unlucky to
lose. Spearheaded by brilliant halt
Catchpole, it scored four tries to
none (North’s 12 points were four
penalty-goals by winger Rowe), and
it was the better side all round.
In the other four games four lead-
ing teams met the four bottom
teams. Gordon beat East 19-8, SL
George found Parramatta a little
tougher than expected, 14-6, Manly
ploughed Eastwood under, 51-5,
and, in an upset, Drummoyne
ended University’s chances, 17-3.

At the S.C.G. on Saturday,
before a crowd of just on
50,000, St. George won its
fourth successive Sydney
Rugby League premiership by
overwhelming Manly 20-0. The
Dragons, breathing fire all through,
scored six tries (three by winger
Lumsden), but, in the gusty wind,
Bath managed to kick only one
goal. Manly tried at first to keep
play in the forwards, as it had
done successfully against West the
previous week; but the battering'
ram St. George pack can give
more than it takes. Manly then
switched play to the backs, but
still could not get through, despite
the pronounced weakness in the
centre (St. George missed its two
brilliant young centres, Gasnier and
Riley, out with injury). A few
minutes from the end Bath and
Manly forward Mossop, both of
whom had played grandly, were

through the season undefeated,
once being held to a 20-all draw
by Balmain (mainly because Bath
had another of his rare off-days
in goalkicking); and it has domin-
ated the competition in the second

With two rounds in the
V.F.L. to go, “the four” now
are Melbourne, Carlton, Col-
lingwood and North, the last
two level on match-points, with
’Wood ahead on percentages. The
other two contenders left in the
running are Fitzroy, two match-
points behind ’Wood and North,
and Essendon, two points behind
’Roy. These last-named two teams
clash at Essendon next Saturday,
and it will almost certainly be the
end for the loser.
At home, with the centre of the
ground a quagmire, Melbourne was
too strong all round for Carlton,
which fell down badly in attack,
13.14-7.5. Collingwood over-
whelmed Richmond 17.17-5.10.
Fitzroy, always tough at home,
finished all over North, 10.23-7.11,
•after a hard, even fight for three
quarters. Hawthorn doubled St.
Kilda’s score, and kicked an extra
point into the bargain, 10.11-5.5;
the Saints were held scoreless in
the second and fourth quarters.
Footscray, cock-a-hoop after its
defeat of Melbourne the week
before, had a good win over South,
at South, 12.13-11.10. Essendon,
though outplayed in the third
quarter, was too strong for the
rest of the time for Geelong,
15.16-12.9.

As it has been every year
since World War II (as also
in 1938 and 1939, the last
two years of competition
beforehand), the Davis Cup
challenge-round will be be-
tween Australia and the
U.S.A. Australia had very
few really anxious moments
getting there; Italy, the
expected main stumbling-
block, proving in the event
easy to pass—though, perhaps,
on the hard courts of Europe
it might have been tougher
for the Aussies.
“ Recorder ” : Australia’s
Davis Cup captain Harry
Hopman isn’t a man who
shows his feelings, but he
must have suffered some as he
sat on the sidelines in the inter-
zone final between Australia
nnd India. In that match
India’s lithely-moving Rama-
nathan Krishnan notched first
point for his country by down-
ing red-headed Queenslander
Rod Laver in four sets, 6-1,
6-4, 8-10, 6-4. Hopman would
have recollected that back in
1954 he was the main instru-
ment in Krishnan changing his
game from spin and slice to
flat-hitting. Krishnan, who
hails from a tennis-playing
family in Madras, and who
always had an ambition to be
a star, decided that Hopman
was the man who should tell
him how to go about reaching
his destiny. So he came to
Australia, competed in the
1954 Victorian championships,
then spent a considerable time
undergoing physical training
and changing his stroke style
at the behest of Hopman.
Incidentally, Krishnan and
American Wilbur Franklyn
Coen each played Davis Cup
matches for their countries
when they were 16 years of
age. That’s a record which
may stand a long test.

“Insider”: Recent announce-
ments of executive officers of sport-
ing bodies show increasing concern
over the mounting costs of adminis-
tration. It would be difficult to
find a sporting organisation of a
non - professional character not
troubled by the rise in the cost ot
keeping its affairs afloat. Some
have dropped to near-bankruptcy,
but others are displaying vision
that must be commended. Take
two examples of how big sports
in Victoria and N.S.W. are tackling
ways of overcoming the desperate
positions facing them. In Vic-
toria John Andrew was recently
appointed secretary of the Amateur
Athletic Association. He adds these
duties to those of positions he
holds as secretary of the Victorian
Golf Association, and secretary of
the Lawn Tennis Association of
Australia. To carry on, Andrew,
an accountant, converted his busi-
ness into a sporting “secretariat,”
made himself the “director,” and
in that way efficiently handles,
through assistants, the swag of
duties that come his way. The
same idea is behind negotiations
taking place in Sydney between the
N.S.W. Swimming Association and
the Rugby Union. The Swimming
Association has made overtures to
the Rugby Union to allow its
secretary, Frank Cooper, to be
part-time secretary.

recently won the Queensland
amateur billiard championship

He defeated last year’s title-

1011 in a tense final. Young
will represent Queensland in
the Australian championships
at Brisbane Exhibition Grounds
in September, where in 1953
Bob Marshall recorded his
world amateur record break of
702 in the last hour of the Aus-
tralian billiard championship
to defeat Victorian Tom Cleary.
Both Marshall and Cleary will
be competitors again this year.
Incidentally, Young has also

“Recorder”: Veteran Ameri-
can swimming - coach Bob
Kiphuth, who recently retired
as Director of Physical Educa-
tion at Yale University, made
his name internationally
famous because of his uncanny
ability to detect and develop
a champion. It was the influ-
ence of Kiphuth which kept
American swimming at a high
level. After Sid Grange, sec-
retary of the N.S.W. section
of the Australian Olympic
Federation, got back from the
Helsinki Olympics in 1952 he
recommended that Australia
adopt Kiphuth’s training-
formula. It did, and our
swimmers swept the pool at
the Melbourne Olympics in
1956. Kiphuth, an onlooker,
admired the shoulder- and
chest-developiyient of the Aus-
tralians and their high flota-
tion. And now, keeping on
at Yale as a lecturer in swim-
ming, and due to go to Rome
in an official capacity with the
U.S. team, which he hopes to
see snatch the swimming-
honors from Australia, has
asked Grange to tell him how
Australia proposes to train its
swimmers this year! Says
Grange: “I’ll drop him a line
and tell him to browse through
some of his numerous tracts on
styles. Australia did, and we
put his advice into better
effect.”

“Zorok”: Two boxing
oldsters last week again proved
their right to be world cham-
pions. In particular this
applies to Archie Moore, who at
Montreal retained the light-
heavyweight title by k.o.ing in the
third round Canadian Yvon Durelle
—Moore’s 128th k.o. victim in his
career, said to be the record k.o.
tally. Last December Moore and
Durelle fought a real thriller, both
hitting the canvas several times
before Moore k.o.’d the Canadian
in the 11th. Moore first won the
title in 1952, and it was his eighth
successful defence —same number
of times that Maxie Rosenbloom
successfully staked the title when
he held it (1930-34). The other
successful title-defender —a mere
lad alongside Moore —was 33-year-
old Argentinian Pascual Perez, who
in Tokyo had a clear-cut points-
win over Japanese Kenji Yonekura.
It was from another Japanese,
Yoshio Shirai, that Perez first won
the title, in 1954, and this was
also his eighth successful defence.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
REPORT ON NYASALAND
Come editorial comment on
the report of the Devlin
commission-of-inquiry into the
Nyasaland emergency of last
March, and the U.K. Govern-
ment’s reaction to it:
London “Observer” : “The
British and Nyasaland Govern-
ments are found to have been
justified in declaring a state of
emergency, although not on
the ground of the sensational
‘massacre plot’ ; they were right
to believe that [the African
National] Congress was turn-
ing towards violence; the
decision to call-in troops was
taken on the initiative of the
Governor and not of Sir Roy
Welensky. But the Government
is guilty of the major charges
levelled against it in that there
was no ‘murder plot’; Dr.
Banda was falsely accused ; the
situation after the imposition
of Federation had been allowed
to deteriorate to the point
where a conflict had become
inevitable.
“The African National Con-
gress is guilty of having shown
itself willing to countenance
violence, although it had not
drawn-up any plan for a policy
of violence. In its favor is the
fact that its views on Federa-
tion and its demands for Con-
stitutional reform had received
no consideration. The weight
of oppressive measures had
been placed upon it; and
although it had practised in-
timidation in the lower cadres
of the organisation, this was
not the policy of the top leader-
ship.”
* * *
London “New Statesman ” :
“The report, in fact, shows that
[U.K.] Ministers have falsified
facts to justify their own
political attitudes; it exposes
serious maladministration of
justice, including the use of un-
lawful violence; and it con-
demns some of the very
foundations of British Central
African policy over the past six
years. The [U.K.] Government
now seeks to discredit the com-
mission’s findings ; but in that
context it is worth once again
recalling who the members of
the commission were. The
chairman, Mr. Justice Devlin,
is regarded by most lawyers as
the ablest of the judges now
sitting in the High Court;
while the other three members
were a businessman of high
repute, a former colonial
Governor with African experi-
ence, and Lord Montgomery’s
war-time Chief Intelligence
Officer. Mr. Lennox-Boyd him-
self described them last March
as ‘expert, impartial people,
with judicial experience, ad-
ministrative experience and
with African experience.’ It
is these ‘expert, impartial
people’ who have now spoken.”
* * *
“Manchester G u a r d i a n” :
“[The] Government’s motion
.... looks on the face of it
like an acceptance of the
report, although many of its
points are in fact rejected. The
Government has taken the
report too lightly. It must
realise that the commissioners
—-of its own choosing—carry
great weight. Their account of
the general political situation
in Nyasaland and its deteriora-
tion before the emergency is
highly intelligent; their assess-
ment of the evidence for and
against a murder plot is more
plausible than the Govern-
ment’s ; their findings on the
conduct of the security forces
are convincing—all the more
so for their appreciation of the
fearful difficulties which faced
some of the Government
officers.”
* * *
London “Daily Express ”:
“At a secret meeting the Con-
gress-party leaders talked of
violence and murder. There was
not, however, any detailed
murder plot, in the opinion of
the Devlin commission. But
given the excitable and im-
mature nature of the Nyasa
people which the report
stresses —it seems mere playing
with words to say that the in-
citements to kill did not amount
to a murder plot.
“What is certain is that a
campaign of violence was
urged by demagogues in a
situation of growing tension.
If Sir Robert Armitage had
failed to strike, if Mr. Lennox-
Boyd had failed to sustain him,
both of these men would have
taken a terrifying risk with the

They acted promptly and with
the deep sense of responsibility
which the situation demanded.
For this reason they deserve
the support of Parliament.”

London “Daily Mail ”:
“Critics of the Government’s
measures in Nyasaland are
given a complete answer in one
sentence of the Devlin report.
It says:
“ ‘On the facts we have
found, and in the situation that
existed on March 3, however
it was caused, the Government
had either to act or to abdi-
cate.’
“A serious emergency
existed, and the Government
took powers to deal with it.
They would have been failing
in their duty had they not done
so.”
The same : “There was noth-
ing, says the commission, which
could be called a murder plot,
nor even a cut-and-dried plan.
Yet they also declare that
‘violent action was to be
adopted as a policy,’ and there
was ‘talk of beating and killing
Europeans, but not cold-
blooded assassination or
massacre.’
“The first of these statements
almost cancels the others.
What is a ‘policy’ but a ‘plan’?
And what difference does it
make to a dead man whether
he was ‘murdered’ or ‘assassi-
nated’?
“It is unfortunate that
Nyasaland is called a ‘Police
State,’ even though ‘only
temporarily.’ Every country
under emergency powers is a
‘Police State,’ but is not so
branded before the world.
Nyasaland now is. Yet the
commission says ‘the Admini-
stration has been greatly
trusted by the African villager.’
There is no trust in a ‘Police
State.’ ”

London “Daily Telegraph" :
The difference between the
Devlin commission and the
Government in the view taken
of the outcome of the emerge
ency meeting of the Congress
party on January 25 is very
largely a matter of words. Both
agree that the danger of
violence, which might include
murder, was so great that
emergency powers were neces-
sary.
“It is not so easy to dismiss
the difference of emphasis
which has emerged between
the commission’s view of the
way in which the emergency
powers were used and that
taken by the Governor and the
Government. The exact


ftaiffli in ihe
Jtuiure
Oil has eluded us in the impressive mineral
discoveries of recent years, yet indications of gas
or oil have been found in every mainland State
and in New Guinea.
With the search for oil being intensified over
a wide area of Australia, our hopes rise higher
to the time when its discovery will cap the richness
of our national resources.
When it is found in commercial quantity,
every concept of our advancement as a nation will
have to be revised dramatically upward.
It is good, then, to see the surveying and
prospecting being stepped up, and American and
Canadian companies joined in the search with
Australian enterprise. They are being assisted,
both actively and in advice, by the Bureau of
Mineral Resources in collaboration with the State
Departments of Mines.
The seeking is costly. More than £6O-million
has been directed, so far, into the search for oil
in Australia and its territories. About half of
that has been applied in Papua-New Guinea,
one-quarter in Western Australia.
In the last four years alone, the overseas
investment has amounted to nearly £2l-million of
sterling and dollar capital.
Against this background of quickening effort,
the Commonwealth Government is encouraging
oil-search companies with broader tax concessions
and additional subsidies towards the cost of drilling.
It is wise policy. For the only way of hastening
discovery —as Canada has so classically, proved—
is in more and more drilling, backed by the best
in scientific techniques for the location of wells.
It will not matter much, nationally, whether
the first discovery is made in the arid interior, on
some near-coastal formation, under the Great
Barrier Reef, or in a jungle fastness in the Territory
of New Guinea. The important thing is that oil
should be brought in, for its own energising worth
and for the inspiration it would give to still more
persevering search.
Faith —much of it—is also in the investment.
And the reward when it comes, as I believe it must,
will be rich indeed.
amount of force which is
necessary for arrest and which
is therefore legal is obviously
impossible to decide in advance.
Those who had to carry out the
operation deserve understand-
ing and some charity from
those who criticise at home.
Indeed, the Devlin commission
itself paid then? a tribute. The
commission goes much too far
in speaking of a ‘Police State.’
Some of its judgments of
particular situations can only
be called academic. Neverthe-
less, there is too much evidence
of the abuse of force for any-
one to be entirely at ease.”
* * *
London “ Spectator” : “The
fact that the Nyasaland
Government ‘had either to
abdicate or to act’ by declaring
an emergency, which they [the
Conservatives] have cited as
evidence in the Governor’s
favor, is really the most out-
right criticism of the official
case in the whole report: for
this is just the kind of situation
which a colonial Government
exists to avoid. All the evidence
in the report, and outside it,
suggests that the Nyasaland
Government had been moving
towards its own destruction
with blind obduracy, in the face
of innumerable warnings and
protests from Britain and of
the united opposition of every
section of the native popula-
tion, for six years. The wonder
is not that there were threats,
but that they did not explode
into violence long before.”
» * »
London “Economist” : “On
the face of it, this explosive
report.... was testimony to
detached British justice and fair-
play. It could even have been
regarded as a feather in the cap
of the Government that set-up
this well-manned commission.
Instead, the Government’s
response has been, roughly,
‘tell the truth and shame the
Devlin.’
“The trouble is that
Ministers chose the commis-
sion, its members and its
methods of inquiry, precisely
to discover the truth. Now they
wish, it seems, to have it both
ways—to lean on the report
where it fits their policies, and
to disparage the rest. It is fair
enough that the Governor-on-
the-spot, Sir Robert Armitage,
and his supporting Ministers in
Whitehall should make their
full rejoinder to the commis-
sion’s strictures and conclu-
sions. But Ministers and their
cohorts in Parliament put them-
selves out of court in so dis-
crediting their own fact-
finders. By so doing, they turn
a blind eye to the warnings
in the report on both the atti-
tudes of the Africans and the
assumptions of their white
rulers. And they set an ill
precedent for all future im-
partial fact-finding exercises, at
home or abroad, in colonies
and in emergent Common-
wealth countries equipped with
British institutions —most im-
mediately and fatefully in
Central Africa itself.”
Hola
A s the “M anchester
Guardian” remarks, “it is
a strange coincidence that the
report on the deaths of Mau
Mau detainees at Hola Camp
in Kenya should appear on the
same day as the Devlin report;
and it must to some extent
distract attention from what
would at other times have made
a great stir.” Three editorial
comments:
London “Observer”: “The
superintendent of the Hola
Camp, Kenya, where 11 Mau
Mau detainees were beaten to
death on March 3, bears the
brunt of responsibility for the
deaths, according to the report
of the disciplinary committee.
The Commissioner of Prisons,
whom the committee blames
for not having sent a copy of
the Cowan plan to the Superin-
tendent, is the only Govern-
ment official to be held in any
way responsible.
“The tenor of the com-
mittee’s report is that the
superintendent far exceeded the
oral instructions he had
received during Cowan’s visit
to the camp in mid-Feburary;
and that if the Cowan plan had
been operated according to the
letter the tragedy would never
have happened. Cowan, says
the report, ‘never envisaged
batons being used.’ His phrase,
‘manhandled to the site of
work and forced to carry out
the task,’ is interpreted as
allowing only ‘compelling
force’ that is, physically
moving a detainee from one
spot to another. This inter-
pretation is wholly at variance
with the finding at the coroner’s
inquest, which stated that these
words would lead any reason-
able person to construe them
as carte blanche to use what-
ever force might be necessary
to ensure the performance of
the task.
“The view of the disciplinary
committee, moreover, tallies
neither with the Attorney-
General’s statement in the
debate on June 16 nor with the
Governor’s letter to the
Colonial Secretary of July 18,


which is published with the
report. Both sought to main-
tain that the use of batons in
seeking compliance with the
order to work might be legal
under certain circumstances. Is
this not what Cowan tried to
convey, albeit ineptly, in his
plan? It is barely credible that
the superintendent should have
ordered that force might be
used for the very first time at
Hola without thinking that the
Cowan plan endorsed (to some
extent at least) such action.”
V * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“The problem before the
officers and their 105 African
warders on March 3 was to
get 85 fanatical resisters to
work so that the spell of the
Mau Mau oath not to work
with the Government could be
broken. The use of ‘compelling
force’ envisaged was not
illegal; the creator of the plan
had never resorted to or recom-
mended the use of batons.
Difficulty was to be expected,
but not disaster. Disaster came
because the plan was misunder-
stood and carried out with in-
sufficient preparation, with too
many prisoners and too few
warders. Moreover, the men
were given tools for their work,
so increasing the danger of
violence....
“Why did this happen? Be-
cause the Commissioner of
Prisons did not send Mr.
Sullivan a copy of the Cowan
Plan? It seems so. Although
the Commissioner of Prisons'
thought there was a ‘risk of
someone getting hurt or killed,’
he omitted this obvious admini-
strative precaution.”
* * »
London “Economist”: “It
cannot be said that justice has
miscarried. Yet this ‘disaster,’
as Mr. Lennox-Boyd has called
it, is made to look more like
an accident or a misfortune.
Some more senior personage in
the chain of authority might
have felt the call for personal
penance, to purge the public
sense of guilt for such happen-
ings in a Crown colony. Of
course other issues hang on
such a gesture—the morale of
the prison-service, the propa-
ganda use to which African
politicians could put it—and if
the chosen course may not
seem instinctively right it no
doubt appears to officials the
lesser evil in the interests of
all.
“The Labor party is not con-
vinced by any of this; they
want Mr. Lennox-Boyd’s or the
Governor’s or somebody’s head.
In the end one is left with a
committee of experts to make
recommendations on the future
of the remaining Mau Mau

tion. The political ripples of
this affair, with others, will
continue to be felt to the dis-
advantage of British rule in
Kenya.”
Vienna Press Freeze
/Commenting on the refusal
of all but one Vienna
newspaper (the small Com-
munist daily) to report events
in the seventh World Festival
of Youth in Vienna, “New
York Times” columnist C. L.
Sulzberger notes:
“The reason for this news-
freeze is purely political. The
youth - conference is un-
abashedly sponsored by the
U.S.S.R. and various fellow-
travelling groups. It is
designed to spread the Com-
munist gospel on such things
as ‘colonialism’ and ‘disengage-
ment’ among the young dele-
gates and to convert the
Viennese to the idea of
Moscow’s benevolence.”
Nevertheless, the same
writer continues, the question
raised is “whether a free press
is morally justified in any
political boycott”:
“Molden [local representa-
tive of the International Press
Institute] argues that the papers
are not banning real news but
only propaganda. Yet this is
assuredly sophism. It is as if
our press were to print no word
about a gathering of more than
100,000 people in New York,
a gathering featured by the
ballet performances of Ula-
nova and a track-meet of
Olympic calibre.
“The Vienna press is aware
that, in a technical sense, it is
doing precisely what the press
of Moscow or of Madrid does
every day refusing to print
what is politically distasteful.
But it feels that fire must be
fought with fire.
“Is this either wise or ethi-
cally correct? Six previous
youth-meetings were held
behind the Iron Curtain. This
is the first to be convened in
a democratic city. Many
Communists, including the con-
ference’s ‘Chief Adviser,’ a
Czech with the fine name of
Pelikan, had hoped to stage
this assemblage in Prague. But
a non-Communist minority
argued successfully for Vienna.
The press boycott is unlikely to
help such endeavors in the
future.
“Even more questionable is
the philosophical wisdom of
this strange manoeuvre. The
Vienna press customarily
pretends, if feebly, to publish
the news that’s fit to print.
But obviously it doesn’t fulfil
this aspiration by censoring the
biggest news because it fears
it. Truth is indeed an abstract
commodity. But it is not easily
capable of being rationed.”
America in Moscow
'Two editorial comments on
the U.S. exhibition opened
in Moscow’s Sokolniki Park by
Vice-President Nixon:
“New York Times’ ’: “What
is taking place in Sokolniki
Park is nothing less than the
confrontation of two civilisa-
tions, of two ways of life. One
is our own, a society where the
consumer is king, where the
great bulk of the productive
mechanism is devoted to
satisfying people’s wants, be
they necessities or whims. The
other is the regimented Soviet
society in which for over four
decades leaders such as Stalin
and Khrushchev have decided
what should be produced on
the basis of an ideology which
glorified the machine-tool and
the steel-mill while viewing the
washing-machine and the dish-
washer—to say nothing of the
home ‘permanent’ kit or the
hi-fi set as of scant conse-
quence. ...
“It would be presumptuous
to suppose that in this con-
frontation all the good is on
our side and all the bad on the
other, just as it would be
foolish to suppose that a
Soviet citizen’s visit to Sokol-
niki will make him an anti-
Communist. The real point is

more subtle: at Sokolniki Park
the Soviet visitor will see that
there is another side to the
United States besides the lurid
tales of unemployment, starva-
tion, racial injustice and the
like with which Soviet propa-
ganda deluges him daily....
“In the minds of many a
Russian visitor the question
must arise—Why does he hear
so little about this side of
American life and why are so
few of these ‘gadgets’ available
in the land of ‘triumphant
Socialism?’ In the Soviet
setting both ideas are subver-
sive, and the fear that they
will arise goes far to explain
why the Soviet regime has
gone so ludicrously and
viciously these past few
months to try to neutralise the
impact of the American exhibi-
tion even before its doors
opened.”
* * *
London “Economist ” : “To
Mr. Nixon the purpose of this
‘exposition’ is to demonstrate
both that Americans have
plenty which they are deter-
mined to defend and also that
they prefer to compete with the
Soviet Union in spreading that
plenty peacefully over the
world rather than in self-
destruction. But the main diffi-
culty of the organisers will be
to convince the 50,000 visitors
who are crowding-in each day
that the average American can
afford, and can find in the
shops, the washing-machines,
cars and clothes which are on
display in such profusion
(washed down with free Pepsi-
Cola).
“Even in the United States
there has been some doubt
whether a true picture is being
presented: the dramatised
fashion-display had to be
altered, after its preliminary
showing in New York had
been criticised on the grounds
that too many of the girls wore
trousers and that Negroes
appeared in unlikely social
situations. The art-exhibition,
too, had to be altered after
Representative Walter claimed
that many of the artists were
Communists and President
Eisenhower admitted that the
abstract works did not appeal
to him personally.
“In one way, at least, the
exposition has undoubtedly
encouraged friendship between
Americans and Russians ; only
a concentrated co-operative
effort got the specially-con-
structed and imaginative build-
ings ready, or as ready as such
shows ever are, by the opening
day.”

impressions I have had, on the
tentative edge of waking to a
perfumed atmosphere of cos-
metics and anecdotes, sur-
rounded by girls. The sort
of awakening (with variations)
that I doubtless dreamed about
on some of those long sleeping
sessions in the Army, but now
find vaguely alarming. Feel-
ing, in fact, less like a sultan
than a harem-retainer.
I will probably get used to
it; but this sensation of
waking in an intimate feminine
atmosphere is still a little con-
fusing. An understandable
association of ideas, I sup-
pose, coupled with a sheltered
youth.
It doesn’t happen every
morning, mind —I’m as likely
to wake to the scent of an
ancient pipe, and with an
angular male elbow in my
ribs —and not that I’m com-
plaining ; it is infinitely pre-
ferable to waking among a
crowd of noisy boys. The
girls are sometimes a bit
rowdy, too, screaming com-
ments about clothes and dates
to each other, but, oddly
enough, I don’t resent it. How-
ever, it is confusing.
Particularly when, just
coming-to, I hear smothered
giggles. I wonder, with a
shade of anxiety, what I have
been doing to amuse them.
Snoring, perhaps. I have been
reliably informed that I do
snore, and the young seem to
find an exhibition of full-
blooded snoring irresistibly
amusing.
Or perhaps I have been
talking in my sleep, which I
also do, very clearly.
Even, perhaps for who
knows what Mr. Hydes lurk
in his subconscious, ready to
leap out with hairy arms
extended after an early-morn-
ing dose of overproof rum —
something worse?
A hasty glance reassures me.
None of the teenagers in my
immediate neighborhood
shows any signs of having
been recently attacked by a
Mr. Hyde ; and, anyway,
returning commonsense reminds
me, in that case I would have
been awakened by screams, not
giggles: surely?
I’ve grossly overrated my
Mr. Hyde. Perhaps there is
no Mr. Hyde ; reassuring and
yet subtly chastening. It’s just
that I’m not used to commut-
ing—and teenagers.
VS7hat makes the atmosphere
so intimate, and yet im-
mediately reduces me from the
status of a sultan with Hydish
tendencies to something de-
cidedly more neutral, is the
calm manner in which the
young ladies proceed with their
toilets; delayed, perhaps, by
their mothers’ insistence that
they eat their breakfasts be-
fore rushing off to catch the
.train. Certainly they look
well-nourished ; and girls and
boys of that age'are notoriously
reluctant to get out of bed,
especially after a late night.
Not all of this is reconstruc-
tion, because the girls talk
about it—Mum screaming
“Eat your breakfast,” the late
night, and much else. Teddy’s
twenty-first party; holidays at
Surfers’ Paradise ; Bert’s new
side-levers —are they tremend-
ous or, on the other hand,
silly?—why Pam isn’t going
out with Jim any more (a dark
business this, demanding whis-
pers) ; new records; Elvis
Presley ; Dad’s unreasonable-
ness about home-comings ; a
girl at work’s massive engage-
ment-ring.
Ah, engagement-rings! The
conversation really warms-up
now ; becomes general. A girl
across the aisle knows a girl
who collects them like postage-
stamps —truly. The trick is, she
doesn’t break-off the engage-
ment ; she provokes the boy
into doing it, and so, of course,
retains the ring. Otherwise
she would be obliged to return
it immediately, by registered
post.
There is a moment of awed
contemplation of this master-
stroke of duplicity, a flurry of
questions: How many has she?
Oh, dozens! What if the boy,
ignoring etiquette, asked for
his ring back? She’d just
laugh. She is—judiciously—a
very pretty girl. But hard.
Oh, definitely hard. And yet
—wistfully—the fellows do run
after her.
There is general condemna-
tion of the wholesale collec-
tion of engagement-rings. No
one present would personally
dream of doing such a thing.
They’d send the rings back by
registered post; pride would
make them. Arid it is agreed
that girls like that come to no
good in the long run; they
miss the bus, in fact.
But there are odd under-
tones. How many rings?
And all the time, with the
cool concentration of cats,
they are arranging themselves.
As the city rushes closer,
applying the works to young
faces which hardly need such
lavish attention, one would
think ; cream, powder, rouge,
lipstick, even eyebrow-pencil
and a smudge of something—
mascara? —to the eyelashes.
Smoothing seams of stock-
ings, twitching suspenders,
tweaking up-curling slips.
Brushing diligently suede shoes
and handbags with little wire
brushes.
As superbly unconscious of
my presence, in these perform-
ances as in their conversation,
as any bunch of young felines
sprucing-up in the sun. Be-
cause of my great age, no
doubt. Although, to be
accurate, the grooming goes
on in the presence of the
young fellows, too. But with
a difference: there are more
sidelong glances, a more care-
ful arrangement of profiles, and
the conversation is not so
uninhibited.
I admire, particularly, the
steady hand of the girl oppo-
site, painting her fingernails.
She keeps-up her end of the
conversation, frowning slightly;
holds her hand up and inspects
the last scarlet tip ; glances out
the window.
“Where are we? Granville!
Oh, bother, I won’t have time
to do my toenails!”
She won’t. After Parra-
matta, on this train, there are
no stops till Redfern. She
stares glumly at her sandalled
feet—it is summer —lip droop-
ing. “Oh, well!”
She brightens, plunges into
the conversation. Perhaps she
has thought of a way out. At
the office, perhaps.
TKjt, of course, the Richmond
train is not entirely popu-
lated with teenagers. There
are other, soberer citizens, of
my own age-group—and above
and below.
Distinctly below, yet not in
the teenage category, is the
Girl in White, who habitually
dresses in this color, and whose
passion for cleanliness must
make every trip a torment.
Do what you will, trains,
and especially steam-trains,
are dirty things. The Girl in
White, before she sits down in
her chosen seat, produces
cleaning-equipment from her
handbag, and all but scours
the seat, the window-ledge and
occasionally the window. She
is fighting a losing battle, but
still fighting.
- Another young woman, a
regular, intrigued me by
removing her shoes and putting
her stockinged feet on a piece
of brown paper. This on
bitterly cold mornings, which
seemed very odd, until my
wife, making the trip with me
one morning, got into conver-
sation with her and learnt that
the paper contained a hot-
water bottle.
T}rom my point of view, the
real flavor of the Rich-
mond trip is gained on the
home-run, simply because I
don’t usually sleep on this
journey.
True, I usually read, so a
good deal of what is passing
by is wasted, but this is not
quite the same as the complete
blotting-out of consciousness.
It is impossible to ignore the
change in the character of the
countryside, after Parramatta.
The western suburbs on the
Sydney side of Parramatta are,
to my mind, a dreary waste,
although one is aware of the
symptoms of bursting growth.
Parramatta, a city now, with
such modern buildings as the
new Grace Brothers’ store
(free parking for customers)
visible from the train, adds to
the impression of energetic
expansion, but has, too, an air
of tradition; and here the
country opens out into fields
and paddocks.
But the really surprising
place for anyone who has not
seen it for some time is Black-
town, with its rows and rows
of estate-agents’ notices, and
so on. The poultryfarms are
still there, but Blacktown is
growing fast. Too fast, for
my liking, if I had to live
there ; but tastes differ.
From there on the landscape
becomes progressively rural, a

different sort of country alto-
gether. And yet, side by side
with this—to my mind pleas-
ing—change, there are the
same symptoms of growth ; of,
if you like, progress. Fac-
tories, housing-developments.
There is a factory at Rich-
mond, and Mark Duffy told
me the other day a factory
will soon be built at North
Richmond, which at present
consists of a pub, a couple of
“Make it THIS day!"
general-stores, a service-station
and a few houses.
Tn the people who travel on
the train, and in the little
holdings along the line, some-
thing of this same spirit of
expansion, of growth, can be
seen.
It is rash to make generalisa-
tions, I know ; but from the
appearance and conversation
of a good many of these
people, particularly the New
Australians, one gets the im-
press.ion of folk less concerned
with keeping-up with the
Joneses than with starting a
home, a family, tilling a little
plot of ground,
Dad goes to work in a fac-
tory or office, but there’s a
sizeable vegetable-plot, a few
chooks, a cow, perhaps, or a
couple of milch-goats.
Maybe some of these people
took-up their blocks of land
under the impression that they
could make a living from them.
That sort of thing has been
going on for a long time in
the County of Cumberland,
making estate-agents rich and
ruining some poor devils.
But, all the same, for those
families who go into it open-
eyed, depending for a living
not on the products of the
soil they can sell, but on wages,
and meanwhile eating some of
the products, it’s not a bad
life. A refreshing contrast to
the rat-race of much metro-
politan living.
And, despite all the disad-
vantages, the false promises of
land-sharks, the bitter prob-
lem of raising capital and the
hard times poultryfarmers are
having, some of them will
make the grade. The grade,
for many, will be what is some-
times scornfully called a pea-
sant’s living—but what’s wrong
with a peasant’s life, anyway?
A snug, debt-free property,
enough to eat, work in the
open air—there are worse
fates.
■puRTHER on, around Wind-
sor and Richmond, the
pattern changes. This, of
course, is very old agricultural
country by Australian
standards, and the marks
of age are there in mellow
homesteads, big old barns
made of home-baked brick.
Dairies, grazing - properties,
thoroughbred-studs.
Leaving Richmond, too,
going by bus to Grose Vale,
we pass by some famous
properties. On the early bus
—which means catching an
early train from the city, at
a quarter-to-four—we go along
the Grose Wold road, branch-
ing-off from North Richmond.
Past Yobarnie, the other
half of the Yeomans Keyline
property, and the old Philip
Charley property, now taken
over by a religious body, down
to where the road branches to
Navua, where Mr. Hill now
runs some half-dozen studs.
Earlier, almost in Richmond
itself, you can see the pad-
docks of Hobartville, one of
the great Hereford studs. And,
of course, there is Hawkes-
bury Agricultural College, on
the eastern side of the town.
But catching the later train,
the twenty-to-six from Central,
you see more of the old faces
—the dyed-in-the-wool com-
muters. They’re a bit tired,
these faces, at the end of the
day, but cheerful, and once
inside the bus there is plenty
of conversation, a contrast to
the grim silence of the morn-
ing. Everyone seems to know
everyone else, and subjects of
local interest are discussed;
and, indeed, of universal
interest. The other evening
there was something very like
a symposium on marriage. It
is, in a way, another world,
after the city. There are, any-
way, clear intimations of that
other world once you board
the bus.
And so home, under the
stars, around 8 p.m. A
long day, but, to a good many
people, the price is one worth
paying.
Walking home from" where
the bus is parked, outside one
of the three Duffy houses, I
generally think it worth while.
If it isn’t raining. Getting the
smell of clean air, seeing the
glitter on the mountains, one
thing and another add-pp to
making it worth while.
Even if it is raining, which
means, as likely as not,
stepping into a succession of
puddles, there are clean
clothes, a fire, hot food wait-
ing. It could be worse . . .
A good deal worse, when
you consider the cross-section
of life you’ve seen, buckshee,
on the Richmond train. And
next morning a new episode
will unroll . . .


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Trade in Birds
In 1839 the pioneer orni-
thologist John Gould, assisted
by his wife, began a study of
the birds of Australia. Ever
since, our bird-life has been
of world-wide interest.
Only one species of cockatoo
occurs outside Australia. No
other country can match our
59 species of parrots, and our
bower-birds are among the
most wonderful of all creatures.
The megapodes, which hatch
their eggs in mounds of decay-
ing vegetable-matter, are found
only in Australia, New Guinea
and a few adjacent islands. The
lyrebird is undoubtedly the
world’s best mimic. We have
69 species of honeyeaters.
Today our budgerigar is
probably the world’s most
popular cage-bird. Also in
high favor overseas are some
of our brilliant little finches.
High prices are paid, particu-
larly in America, for some of
our rarer species of cockatoos,
Major Mitchells having
brought as much as £250 a
pair in San Francisco.
Unfortunately all this has
led to commercial exploitation
of Australian birds which can
be kept in captivity. Most of
these are on the protected list,
but in South Australia the
bird-trappers have been able to
secure permits for taking them.
The birds are then sent to
other States which have a ban
on the capture of the species,
except for scientific purposes.
This importation cannot be
prohibited because it would
contravene Section 92 of the
Constitution, under which
trade between the States must
be free.
It is possible, with a permit
secured in S.A., to catch pro-
tected birds in Victoria or
N.S.W. and to claim that they
were caught across the border.
There is evidence that an
appreciable number of Major
Mitchell cockatoos have been
trapped in northern Victoria,
where they are totally pro-
tected, and sent to Melbourne
under cover of a South Aus-
tralian permit.
In the same way large
numbers of finches are trapped
and marketed. A serious and
unpublicised feature of this
traffic is the number of birds
which die before becoming
accustomed to captivity. One
trapper, when the owner of a
station commented that he
must be coining money, replied:
“You forget the losses. I’ve
had half the birds die before I
could get them to Melbourne.”
The export of our native
birds has suffered a severe
depline since the accompanying
documents have been en-
“Find that pawnticket! I NEED the Rolls!”
dorsed: “These birds cannot
be certified as free from psitta-
cosis disease.” But sales within
Australia are booming.
Learned societies and bird-
lovers’ leagues in other States
have protested in vain to the
South Australian Government
about this traffic, but surely the
Federal Government could do
something about it?
Struthious (S.A.).
Buying Houses
“W.P.T.” is out of this
world in comparing the pur-
chase of a motor-car with the
purchase of a house (B.
22/7/’59).
Quite apart from the
extreme difficulty in finding
loan-money for home-purchase
—a time - consuming and
frustrating pastime, as can be
verified by anyone who has
gone for financial assistance
to co-operative building-
societies, banks, insurance-
companies or the War Service
Homes Division in recent years
—there are so many traps for
the unwary in land-purchase
that only the foolish would
rush in, sign a contract, have
a transfer prepared and
executed and complete the
purchase without arranging for
a careful search of title.
In N.S.W. so many en-
cumbrances can be slapped
on land-titles as a result of
town-planning schemes, zoning
for this, that and the other by
local-government authorities,
easements by the water, drain-
age and electricity authorities —
to say nothing of the problems
posed by the number of “Old
Systems” titles that still
remain—that careful search is
essential in a purchaser's
interest. -
We all know that no one in
this State hurries to complete
his job these days, and
solicitors, the Registrar-
General’s staff, valuers, etc.,
are no exception. About the
only fellow who cannot justly
be accused of contributing
deliberately to delays is the
estate-agent. He doesn't earn
his money until the sale is
completed and settled.
That means an average wait
of four months for payment
for work done, and with every
passing day the fruits o is
labor could be lost as the result
of vendor or purchaser becom-
ing fed-up and deciding not to
proceed with the deal.
No, the estate-agent isn’t to
blame In fact, some people
blame estate-agents when they
try to hurry-up a sale by
arranging for contracts to be
signed and exchanged by the
parties before submission to
solicitors for title-search and
preparation of conveyance.
Unfortunately, the wrong type
of agent often adopts this
speed-up method, and the
parties to the contract find
that their interests have been
made subservient to the agent’s
desire to ensure payment of
his commission.
Much delay occurs in
solicitors’ offices, where con-
tracts have been known to lie
in the “too hard” basket for
two months or more before
action is taken at the insistent
urging of a harassed agent or
purchaser.
Then, of course, there is the
purchaser- who doesn’t want
too speedy an action on the
contract he has signed. He has
yet to dispose of his own place
in order to raise the whole
or part of the purchase price
of the new place—a fact he
probably didn’t reveal to the
agent until he was handed a
contract for signature,
N.S.W. country agents are at
times incensed by experiences
with sales of property where
transfer of title is subject to
Minister’s consent. They wait
weeks for such consent if they
forward applications by mail,
but fmd that if they go to the

WHY SETTLE FOR A SMALL CAR*
HOLDEN GIVES
MUCH MORE VALUE...
Perhaps you believe a small car will be more economical. Before you
decide compare all the advantages of Holden* Consider Holden’s
extra value in terms of motoring enjoyment, luxury, pride of possession and
modern styling. Take everything into account not just price on the road,
but running costs, repair bills and resale value as well. You’ll find you can own
a new, four door, six cylinder Holden for as little as the average small car.
HERE’S WHY HOLDEN RESALE
VALUE SAVES YOU MONEY
Comparing prices, buying a small
four cylinder car (8 to 14 h.p.) will
involve you in lower capital outlay
than a new Holden. But the impor-
tant thing is to estimate what you’ll
get back for your car when you sell it.
From used car advertisements you
will see that the small car drops in
value more rapidly than a Holden.
Holden’s high resale value saves you
big money on depreciation. In fact,
the savings can wipe out all the
economies that you might expect to
get from a small car.
HERE’S HOW ECONOMICAL
HOLDEN IS ON PETROL
Assuming you run up about 5,000
miles a year. Now a small car might
give you around 40 m.p.g. about
£24 a year for petrol. Yet Holden,
on top of all its other advantages,
would cost you only about £lO extra
for petrol each year.
HERE’S WHY HOLDEN SAVES
YOU MONEY ON REPAIRS
Small cars usually have small parts
in high revving, hard working small
engines ... and so, there’s more like-
lihood of wear. On the other hand,
Holden has a robust six cylinder
engine that’s famous for mile-in mile-
out reliability.
With a Holden, too, you’ll pay less
for genuine parts and you’ll get them
wherever you drive, for Australia is
ringed with Holden Dealers to give
you efficient, low cost service.
HERE’S WHY THERE'S MORE
ENJOYMENT DRIVING HOLDEN
Tired of seeing Holdens pass you on
hills? In top gear, too, you’ll have
noticed. Frustrated with the lack of
room inside and the limited luggage
space you get in most small cars?
Why not change all that drive a
new Holden.
BE OUR GUEST-
DRIVE HOLDEN NOW
Why not contact your Holden Dealer
now and arrange to test a new
Holden? Ask about the convenient
GMAC Hire Purchase Plan. The
more you go into it the more you’ll
realise that owning a new Holden
really costs you no more than a
small car and there’s more room,
more comfort, more vision, more
motoring fun for you and your
family when you drive a Holden.

Careers in Philanthropy
As a church treasurer or
auditor for more than 20 years,
and with a view to assisting
some young men to launch a
fund-raising campaign for a
country church, I have
followed with close interest the
statements of “Ardoyne” (B.
1/7/’59) and “Pin” (B.
15 / 7 / ’59).
“Ardoyne” wisely counsels
caution when making a pledge
which can extend over three
years. In one case, where a
country congregation engaged
an organiser at £l2OO spread
over 400 family units and raised
enough to extend buildings,
etc., they decided on a further
three-year term and engaged
an outside organiser at £9OO
spread over a reduced total of
200 family units, while the
“open plate” contributions were
maintained on a much higher
level than previously.
There is much to be said in
favor of employing an outside
organiser and in confining
canvass and recording of
pledges to men. The paid
organiser’s work is not over
in a few weeks, as stated by
“Pin,” and congregations
which have decided to do with-
out an expert’s assistance have
found time dragging on too
long—and with much smaller
results.
I also disagree with “Pin’s”
statement that the increased
income comes from “the
parishioners’ pockets.” The
campaign is directed at the
“nominals,” the “M.C.8.5.Y.,”
who want all the services a
church can give, with little or
no payment for same, and are
not backward in criticism.
(The initials stand for
marriages, christenings, burials,
schools —Sunday and others —-
and youth-organisations.)
The main financial burden
of very many congregations —
at any rate in the country
has long been, and still is,
carried by the dwindling older
generation for instance, an
overall cost of minister, car,
buildings and general expenses
of about £3O a week borne by
a congregation of 50 to 60
members and casual adherents.

Glad to hear from “Tray
Bit” (B. 29/7/’59) that foot-
in-door tactics are not, to his
knowledge, the methods usually
employed in organised fund-
raising campaigns. Possibly, in
the instance I referred to, the
organisation concerned might
have chosen its professional
advisers a bit unwisely; but
the conversation quoted was
related exactly as told to me
by one who took part in the
campaign.
It is evidence, I suggest,
that, as “Tray Bit” concedes,
“there may well be some high-
pressure salesmen canvassing” ;
and it is precisely this sort of
thing to which I objected. Isn’t
it pressing the claims of
philanthropy too far to suggest,
directly or indirectly, that a
person should bind himself for
a stated period to contribute a
fixed percentage of his income
to a cause, however worthy,
without regard to his private
and domestic obligations?
I agree that the community
could never so well afford new
churches and other institutions
as it can now. But when I
counselled caution in banking
on current prosperity I was
thinking of the serious financial
plight in which many churches
found themselves during the
’thirties as a result of biting-
off more than they could chew
in the lush pre-depression days,
j don’t object in principle
to the professional fund-
raiser ; the extent to which his
services are necessary or desir-
able depends on circumstances,
Many churches have within


their own ranks men just as
capable as the professional of
organising a fund-raising cam-
paign. Organised, regular con-
tributions are no novelty in
the church I belong to, and
our new building is being
financed without resorting to
a professional fund-raiser. —

Teaching Languages
Russian is, of course, just as
good a language as French for
secondary-school pupils (B.
5/ 8 / ’59) —provided they don’t
waste all their time on what the
late Professor Huxley used to
call “gerund-grinding” (i.e.,
grammar). Incidentally, in
Russia today the compulsory
second language is English, and
it will soon be taught there
from the age of seven.
A party of English public-
school lads —with the head-
master of Repton, an Eton
master and a Gordonstown
master—lately visited one of
Moscow’s numerous boarding-
schools and were agreeably
surprised at all they saw there.
Everyone in the party remarked
on the fact that even the
youngest child in the school
could speak to them in English.
“Cunedda’s” assertions about
the cultural value of French as
a school subject make no kind
of sense to me ; for, though
I’m not a French specialist, I’ve
often, over the years, taken
classes in French up to sixth-
“I can't make up my mind whether their socks
stretch to the hips.”
form level in Australian
secondary schools in which lip-
'service was paid to this ideal.
I can recall only a very odd
six-former who was anything
but a typical product of the
grammar-grind, and I can’t
recall even one instance of a
sixth-form boy, hovering on
the brink of matriculation, who
was able to do anything more
than construe, with difficulty,
passages from a prescribed
French author—and that was
the fruit of all their secondary-
sch°°l work in French,
Further, in all my years in
this country, and in all my
contacts with university- and
school-staffs, I can recall only
one man who ever appeared to
have benefited from French
literary culture. That man was
the late Chris. Brennan — Sir
(Q-).
Surely “Cunedda’s” case for
teaching French in Australian
secondary schools has the same
weakness he found in “G.R.’s”
argument in favor of teaching
Russian (B. 5/8/’59)?
As “Cunedda” says, “few
who pass through secondary
school are ever likely to do
scientific research” ; but an
even smaller number of pupils
are likely to have the inclina-
tion or the competence to read
the “brilliant, varied and
copious literature” of France
in the original. Some support
for this claim is to be found
in the number of students of
French in universities, com-
pared with the number of
science-students.
One unfortunate result of
the prestige of a foreign
language is that many able
mathematics pupils are obliged
to do French in order to take
Mathematics I and 11. The
alternative is to avoid French
and take General Mathematics,
since subjects are tied together
to form courses —which pro-
vide the pupil with little
choice.
This situation arises partly
from the subordination of the
interests and needs of the
majority or of large minorities
to those of a small group of
pupils—perhaps 10 per cent,
of the secondary-school popu-
lation —who undoubtedly profit
from the intellectual discipline
of foreign-language study.
One of the most attractive
features of the proposed
Wyndham Report scheme is
that it will allow pupils to do
an elective subject of their
choice without having to study
another subject which, under
the present system, “goes with
it.”
Such a scheme presents all
sorts of problems for those
responsible for staffing schools
and drawing-up timetables, but
it should do much to reduce
the resentment of pupils who
at present are virtually com-
pelled to do some unsuitable
subjects.—-A. J. W. (N.S.W.).

in the house with this woman
Barbara, and her husband
Galloway, on a trip to Sydney
with a load of general stuff.
The two of them there
together.
Che, in the darkness, hearing
the truck pull-up outside
and the footsteps on the path,
telling him to get out quickly.
Running down the dark
hallway with his shoes. A
shoe in each hand. Into the
kitchen.
The man’s shirt was un-
buttoned right down to his
waist. His shoes were on the
floor of the car and one was
on its side under the brake-
pedal.
Hearing Galloway hurrying
down the side-path. The man
running back out the front
door to his car and starting
with a cold motor and two of
the plugs not firing and swear-
ing at himself for not replac-
ing the plugs when the car
wouldn’t pull.
Getting away onto the back
road, getting clear ; then see-
ing the lights of the truck in
the rear-vision mirror, coming
all the time, getting bigger,
blinding, filling the mirror with
dazzling whiteness; the man
with his foot hard down on
the accelerator, unable to draw
away from the lights.
The truck overtaking; the
engine roaring alongside ; the
shock through the car as
grating metal screamed ; the
fence in front —through the
fence.
“He . . . wanted to . . .
kill me.”
Charlie didn’t know what to
say. He stood uneasily near
the car door with his hands in
the pockets of his jeans and
looked in at the man —with
interest, now.
The man was about 40, the
flesh on his face becoming
loose. His head was almost
bald on top and he had
allowed his greasy, dark hair
to grow long at the sides and
back so that it pointed quill-
like down his neck.
He said “Stay here. Stay
here. Son, I’m sick. Sick.
In the mouth. But I don’t
feel anything . . . much. Like
asleep. Or tired. And my
head . . . my head . . .” He
groaned.
He said apologetically “I
just want someone ... to
talk to.”
“You want to be quiet. You
want to cut-out that talking,”
Charlie told him impatiently.
“It’s worse when you talk.
The ambulance won’t be long.
You want to be quiet until the
ambulance comes. They’ll fix
you up.”
The man wasn’t listening
about the ambulance. He
insisted “No. It’s . . . it’s
better keep talking.”
He talked about Barbara.
She said it would be all right
because Galloway was away
on another trip and he wouldn’t
be back that night. The other
times were all right, but Gallo-
way came back early this time.
Barbara was frightened as hell.
He knew, the way she told
him to get out. But there was
no need to do this to him.
What about her ? he asked
Charlie. She asked him to
come to the house? What
about her?
“I dunno,” Charlie said
vaguely. “I don’t know much
about it.” Then he walked
back to the packs. It made
him uneasy looking at the man
and listening to him talk crazy
like that.
Charlie sat down and studied
the crumpled bonnet of the
car.
It must have been some
smash, all right, with the car
going through the fence, the
driver gripping the wheel, his
foot hitting the brake-pedal
with that shoe jammed under
it —and closing his eyes and
shielding them with his arm,
maybe, when he saw the tree
coming at him in the beam of
the lights. It must have been
some smash.
/Charlie unhooked his water-
bottle from the side of his
pack and had a drink. Then
,he stood up and walked over
to the car, carrying the bottle.
He held up the bottle so that
the man could see it.
“You thirsty, mister?”
The man moistened his lips.
“Yeah. Damn’ thirsty.’*
Charlie held the bottle near
his face. “Can you manage it?”
He saw the concentration of
effort on the face, then the
quick fear-movement in his
eyes.
“What’s up with you, mister?
Sick? Want me to help you
with it?”
The man looked at Charlie
despairingly. Charlie could
see that he was distressed about
something. He thought the
man might start crying, or
worse, vomit. He couldn’t
stand that. He walked away
from the car and stood look-
ing up at the road. He wished
Roy would come back. They
had 20 miles to hike that day
and this hold-up was a damn’
nuisance.
He heard the man calling to
him. He went back and the
man said desperately “Some-
thing’s wrong. Couldn’t drink.
Drink water.”
“That’s okay. Maybe you
just didn’t feel like it, eh?”
“But . . . something’s wrong.
Can’t move . . . anything.
Can’t move!”
“Well, I’ll help you with it.”
The man started to say some-
thing else, but Charlie
ignored it.
He reached into the car and
pulled the man back from the
wheel with one hand, the other
holding the waterbottle. The
man cried out once and his
head sagged and slumped onto
his chest.
/Charlie called urgently to the
man and thought to drop
the waterbottle. His hand un-
hampered, he pushed him fur-
ther back on the seat, and the
man’s head jerked sideways.
Charlie sprang back from
the car and turned around and
looked-up at the road. No one
there yet. He wiped his sweaty
hands on the thighs of his jeans
and walked around in a tight
circle with his eyes closed.
He knew that the man was
dead, so he let him fall for-
ward over the wheel. Then
he went around behind the car
and sat on the bumper-bar
because his legs were too weak
to support him.
He arranged the body just
as he and Roy had found it,
sagged over the wheel, his face
towards the window. He tried
to open the door to get his
waterbottle from the floor of
the car, but the door was
buckled and jammed, so he
had to worm his body through
the window and reach down
for it between the man’s legs.
Some water had run on the
floor, and he mopped it up
with his handkerchief.
All he had to do then was
to wait for Roy to come back
with the ambulance. He
couldn’t do anything more.
Everything was just as he and
Roy had found it. He hoped
Roy wouldn’t be too long.
He wanted to get away from
there.
He didn’t know anything
about a man named Galloway,
or anything else. He didn’t
want to be mixed-up in any-
thing like that.


THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
DEPOT-SHED
From BILL HOWARD
'T'his depot-shed in the far
central-west of N.S.W.
may be the shape of things to
come. About 45,000 sheep are
shorn here each year —mainly
from graziers with mobs of
between 1500 and 2000—but
it’s not a continuous shearing.
A local shearing-contractor
does the job, with a good team
of local shearers who are
always keen to come. They
shear a lot of sheep and get
home every weekend.
Owners pay 3d. a sheep shed-
rental above the contractor’s
quoted price. This pays for
shed- and hut-maintenance,
diesel-oil, etc., and makes the
final cost sound pretty formid-
able: £25 for 2000 sheep.
A grazier lamenting about
costs said: “Actually, I know
I’m on a good thing ; to build
a two-stand shed and huts
would cost a lot of dough and
a lot of blues with the Missus,
who would have to cook for
the two shearers.”
He’s quite right this
The apparent need for
repeated drenching of
sheep does not neces-
sarily indicate worm
trouble. It is essential
if sheep are scouring to
obtain a correct diag-
nosis before drenching,
as all too often, scour-
ing sheep are repeatedly
drenched when other
problems lack of
proper nutrition mainly
—are the causes of
scouring.
Remember a drench
usually decreases the
animal’s appetite, hence,
too frequent drenching
leads to insufficient
food intake with con-
sequent scouring.
Further drenching can
only aggravate the
condition.
Remember, too, the
use of Elastrator
Rubber Rings for Cas-
trating, Tailing and
Marking considerably
reduces the risk of fly-
strike, set-back and
similar diseases.
£25 extra cost is good odds to
a capital investment of several
thousand pounds, which lies
idle except for two or three
weeks a year.
In the team are six shearers
(who shear between 700 and
800 sheep a day), a woolclasser,
and a full wool-room of keen
shed-hands.
Annual shearing is over in
three days; there’s marital
“ Careful , it may be some sort of trap!”
peace in the homestead, and
all the boss has to do is sign the
cheque and try to look
pleasant.
It is essential in a depot-shed
of this size that there are
plenty of bins and shed-room.
The ideal shed is an old 20-
stander with oceans of room.
Then there’s no lost time
cleaning and pressing-up be-
tween owners. A full clean-up
every couple of days makes it
uneconomic both for shearer
and contractor.
Another practice here is
shed-blending. It takes a
grazier in a fairly big way to
get five bales of bellies or locks.
But two neighbors or cobbers
with small mobs may decide to
blend these wools and save
blending-costs “down below.”
Frozen Vegetables
“Agricola”: Two vegetables
popular when deep-frozen are
beans and peas. Both pack
well and, provided they are
not old, keep excellently in the
deep-freezer.
To be at their best, beans
should be picked as soon as
the pods have stopped growing.
If left too long on the bush the
seeds will start to swell, and
in the intense cold of the deep-
freeze they will split and turn
mushy nothing puts the
housewife off quicker.
On the other hand, if beans
are picked too soon they wilt
in the cold, and, instead of
having plump, meaty beans,
you finish-up with a plateful of
withered, wilting pods.
It’s the same with peas. If
pods are shelled before the
seeds are packaged and deep-
frozen it’s essential that the
peas should be picked in their
prime, otherwise discolored
seeds show-up.
Also, when peas and beans
are picked in their prime and
not allowed to grow old on the
bush the harvest is heavier.
Ageing pods take more out of
the plants than the younger
second and third crops. Where
soil is dry, watering between
harvests will keep the pods
growing.
Tea in Queensland
“Myall”: Back in 1936 the
Bureau of Tropical Agriculture
established an experimental
tea-plot at South Johnstone
(N.Q.), and now, after 14 years,
the plantation of several acres
is still growing vigorously and
producing about 10001 b. of dry,
ungraded leaf an acre each
year.
That compares favorably
with the average yields of the
main tea-producing countries.
The tea is good, too —in fact,
has been so rated by profes-
sional tasters of commercial
tea-firms, who say it may be
used pure or for blending.
The cost of cultivation can
be kept within reasonable
bounds ; but Queensland, with
its high living-standards, cannot
compete with the harvesting
costs of the main tea-producing
centres. This calls for mechani-
sation in the processes of
harvesting and manufacture.
At South Johnstone modified
hedge-clippers have been used,
but even these do not produce
leaf at a price to compete with
other countries. Now another
plantation has been established,
with plants set in rows 12in.
and 18in. apart, in order to
facilitate the use of clippers
and further reduce picking-
costs.
Mushroom-culture
“Agaracus”: The
of commercial mushroom-
growing are good fresh spawn,
a watertight building, plenty
of fresh manure and careful
preparation of the beds.
Reliable brands of spawn
can be got from most seeds-
men. The building housing
the beds must be entirely
enclosed, but a sound shed,
cellar or basement, which need
not be lightproof, will do,
because mushrooms grow
equally well in either sunlight
or darkness, provided they are
protected from rain.
Several yards of fresh
manure are needed, according
to the size and number of beds
to be made. Small piles of
less than a cubic-yard will not
heat sufficiently, so large heaps
should be built. Stable-manure
containing a proportion of
straw is best, but horse- or
cow-manure with straw mixed-
in is satisfactory.
Don’t use sawdust, shavings
or tan-bark in the mixture;
these are fatal to the spawn.
Steer clear of old manure,
which has lost its power of
fermentation.
When mixed, pile the
material in a conical heap,
sprinkling it evenly with water ;
then level it off, and leave it
for three or four days, before
giving the first turning. Work
round the heap carefully and
methodically, removing the
outside layer to a depth of
9in. and making this the inside
of the new heap. Turn the
pile, so that the inside of the
old heap becomes the outside
of the new, and repeat the
operation five times, at inter-
vals of four days, adding a
little water with the first three
turnings.
After another three or four
days the compost should be
ready for use, binding when
pressed in the hand without
any sign of surplus moisture,
but neither too wet nor too

dry. If it’s too dry, add fresh
manure to the pile, moistening
it all the time, and then allow
it to lie for a few days.
Make the compost into beds
12in. deep and pack it down
lightly, either by trampling or
with a rammer. Where space
is limited and a passage can
be made on only one side,
make the bed 3ft. wide ; but,
if there’s space, 6ft. is usual.
Allow the beds to lie undis-
turbed for three days, then
plant the spawn in pieces the
size of a walnut. Space these
12in. apart each way and 2in.
deep, firming the compost
about each piece. Cover the
beds with sheets of paper and
do not disturb for ' another
week. The use of hessian or
bags for covering should be
avoided, because these generate
too much heat.
At the end of the week
uncover the beds and give a
dressing of lin. good clean
loam that will hold moisture.
Water this daily, taking care
that the moisture does not
penetrate to the compost
beneath.
Six or seven weeks after the
spawn is planted mushrooms
will appear and the beds will
then produce crops at intervals
of a few days for four or five
months. When beds cease pro-
duction, discard the compost
and prepare fresh ones for the
next crop. The old material
is good for mulching or manur-
ing vegetable-beds.
Beef Industry
Up North
“D.C.T.”: I read “F.A.’s”
par. (B. 3 /6/ ’59) and also that
by “J. 8.” (B. 15/7/’59) and
must say that I agree with the
former. For good or ill, the
great bulk of Australian popu-
lation-increase will take place
in N.S.W., Victoria and South
Australia. Quite apart from
any natural increase, it is those
three States that are attracting
90 per cent, of the migrants,
and, as the major industrial
portions of the Commonwealth,
they will continue to do so.
It follows naturally that
those States will need the meat-
production of the North. If
present prices for cattle are any
criterion, they are going to
need it pretty badly in the very
near future.
Air-transport of beef is all
very well, but I cannot see it
taking the place of railways.
Suggest to Tancred Bros, that
they should stop using the rail-
ways and go in for air-freight,
and just see what answer you
get. And Tancred’s works at
Bourke (N.S.W.) are only 500
miles from Sydney—not 2000.
I have been in the Kimber-
leys, and know that Airbeef,
at Glenroy, has done quite a
good job on a small scale.
When 50,000 to 100,000 cattle
a year have to be handled, it’s
a different story.
I think “J. 8.” overstresses
the financial considerations. If
Darwin was linked to Sydney
by a standard-gauge line, and
the trip done in three days,
much traffic now going by air
would come to the railways.
Perishables, like butter, green
vegetables, fruit, etc., would be
sent by rail. So would the
mails, yet at present, if I want
to write to Darwin, I am
almost forced to send the
letter airmail, because of the
time taken overland.
I suggest that “J. 8.” should
study the annual report of the
Commonwealth Commissioner
for Railways for the year
ended 30/6/’5B. From it he
will learn that the line to Alice
Springs showed a net profit of
more than £1 million after pay-
ment of interest on loans.
Granted that the Leigh Creek
traffic accounted for almost
half the total earnings,
it still looks as if “J. 8.” is a
bit off-beam when he claims
that the proposed railways
would lose £4,000,000 a year.
You must remember that there
are two breaks of gauge on that
line —at Port Pirie 'and Marree
—and these increase working-
expenses ; and now that the
standard-gauge line is open to
Marree, resulting in much
larger train-loads from Leigh
Creek, the Commissioner
anticipates—with evety justifi-
cation in my opinion that
working - expenses will be
reduced.
The air-services operating in
Central Australia and the
Kimberleys have certainly
removed the former isolation
of the outback stations and
given them a sense of security
in time of sickness, but they
have had little actual effect in
inducing greater settlement.
Only railways will do that. And
the airways do not cater for
heavy traffic, cement, fencing-
wire, timber, etc., all of which
will be required in large
quantities once the country is
really opened-up for closer-
settlement.
Railways opened-up and
made possible the settlement
of western Canada and the
western States of the U.S. And
only railways will do the same
for the Territory and Kim-
berleys.
“E.J.”: “J. 8.” is on the right
lines in advocating well-placed
inland abattoirs (B. 15/7/’59).
The aim must be to preserve
the tenderness and taste of
meat, and you can’t do this
better than by slaughtering on
the spot, or nearby.
Compare that with slaughter-
ing cattle tired after a long
trek and railed hundreds of
miles without water. Under
such conditions, which are
bound to produce nervous ten-
sion, tasteless and tough flesh
is all that can be expected.
However, there’s now not
much need for air-transport.
Refrigeration allows cartoned
meats to be frozen in 36 hours
and, with modern self-refrige-
rated trucks, the boned product
can be safely landed at cool-
stores on the coast for ship-
ment.
Whey for Pigs
“Big Billy”: Though pigs
have a particular liking for
whey, it should never be used
as the only food for them, its
water-content being far too
high. A supplement grain or
meal is necessary.
Also young pigs can’t take
whey. They need a mixture of

(5/8/’59)
Most of Queensland should have moderate to good
rains during September, although falls may be light on the
Peninsula, centre-coast, north-western and far-western dis-
tricts. Good rains are likely in October, and should extend
into the far south-western districts.
N.S.W. should get moderate to good rains during Sep-
tember, with best falls on the central-western districts,
though probably light on part of the Riverina and far-
western districts. Similar rains should be received in
October, with heavy general rains in November.
Good general rains are likely in Victoria during Sep-
tember and October; heavy rains and widespread flooding
may occur in November.
There should be good rains in the agricultural areas
of South Australia during September, although falls may be
light in the interior. Good general rains are likely in
October.
Moderate rain is indicated in the s.-w. agricultural areas
of Western Australia during September, although there
should be good rains on the south-coast and south-eastern
districts and around Eucla. Rainfall may be light elsewhere.

finely-ground grain and meat-
meal until they can eat a
pound of three-parts ground
grain and one part meatmeal
mixed. Then, if enough whey
is available, this quantity of
food with a little greenstuff
will be all they’ll need. As
they grow, only the whey need
be increased ; but if they don’t
thrive it’s probable that they
can’t cope with the water in the
whey and need more solid food.
Sows, on the other hand,
can take a lot of whey, and
when dry need little else except
grass, other green-feed or
lucerne-hay. Suckling sows
need 21b. to 31b. meal a day
as a supplement.
When feeding whey it’s
important to give meatmeal,
because otherwise there won’t
be enough proteins. Ground
limestone is a useful addition ;
it neutralises the acid and pro-
vides a calcium-supplement.
Generally, lib. should be used
with every 100 gals. whey.
Wimmera Wheat
“Ymar”: The Wimmera,
Victoria’s great wheatgrowing
area, has an average annual
rainfall of only 20in.
The first experimental crop
thereabouts was grown in 1840
on Walmer station, three miles
from Horsham. No record of
the yield remains, but grain
from that first harvest, ground
in a handmill, provided the
station-folk with wholesome, if
somewhat coarse, bread.
Now Wimmera farmers,
making use of modern methods
of cultivation, harvest up to
70 bushels of wheat an acre.
Sprouts
“Sundowner”: Brussels
sprouts need cool, moist
weather during maturity and
irrigation for early growth.
They do best in well-drained
soil, with heavy, balanced
dressings of fertiliser, and the
seed must be carefully selected
to suit the district.
It’s best to precede them
with a winter green-manure
crop of broad-beans or oats
to tone-up the soil. Start in the
seedbed by spraying the seed-
lings with molybdenum—loz.
molyb. dissolved in hot
water and applied to each 10
square-yards. Initial dressings
of lime and animal or organic
“And safer , too —in a country that Worships the horse !”
manure are also good if given
in sufficient quantities. A base-
dressing of a fertiliser contain-
ing phosphate, nitrogen and
potash, up to 2 tons an acre,
with side-dressings of nitro-
genous manures during late
autumn, will keep the plants
growing well into the cooler
weather. Rates should be
scwt. an acre in one or two
dressings.
Blackleg can only be effec-
tively controlled by hot-water
treatment. Tie the seed loosely
in a cheesecloth bag and
immerse in water at 122 deg. F.
for half-an-hour, continually
stirring the water. This treat-
ment reduces *he germination
of old seed, so it should be
carried out when the seed is
first collected.
Sowing in drill-rows is
better than broadcasting. Keep
the seed 3in. to 4in. apart.
October to November are the
best months.
Spraying to combat aphis
and other chewing insects will
be necessary from the time the
plants are three weeks old.
Best months for transplanting
are December and January.
Irrigate at once to set them
in and keep up regular water-
ings.
You’ll only make the best of
your sprouts-paddock if
minute attention is given to
seed-strains. In selecting plants
for seed, look for these things:
uniformity and trueness to
type; size, color and shape;
firm sprouts spaced on the
stem close enough to provide
heavy yields, without making
picking difficult; freedom from
disease.
Sprouts which attain this
standard can be lifted at the
end of August and replanted
well apart in a good patch of
soil, taking care that there
aren’t any other crops of
the cabbage family nearer than
half-a-mile or half this
distance from crops of swedes
and turnips during the flower-
ing-period.
Collect the seed when
mature, thresh it into bags and
sieve it. Sound seed can be
stored for five years, but
germination will decline with
age. About 4oz. seed is needed
for an acre ; but, if the seed
is old, this amount could be
increased twice or three times.
Sorghum-almum
“Belar”: The sale of
sorghum-almum seed is pro-
hibited in Queensland, but
the plant is widely grown
on the Darling Downs.
Growers are disposing of seed
to fellow-graziers, and cannot
supply the demand, although
they harvest large quantities.
When it was introduced
about eight years ago
C.5.1.R.0. agronomists were
suspicious of the plant, because
it’s a cross between Johnson-
grass and Souda%grass, and
they feared it might spread in
cultivation. They therefore
recommended that it should be
proclaimed a noxious weed.
Sixty years ago Johnson-
grass—or evergreen-millet, as
it was then erroneously called —■
was highly thought-of as a
fodder-grass, especially on poor
land in dry districts. But its
habit of spreading was recog-
nised and so was the difficulty
of getting rid of it.
When Soudan-grass was
introduced in 1913 Johnson-
grass lost popularity and was
declared a noxious weed.
Soudan, and its sport, sweet
Soudan, are annuals, widely
grown in most States and
reaching about sft. in a few
weeks. They may be grazed
or cut for hay or silage.
After tests with sorghum-
almum, C.5.1.R.0. agronomists
are convinced that it possesses
the good qualities of the
parent-plants, without the risk
of becoming a pest, and they
now recommend it to graziers
and dairyfarmers in districts
where Soudan does well.
Research in Queensland
shows that there are about
46-million acres in tropical and
sub-tropical parts of the State
where it could increase the
carrying-capacity to six times
its present level. In favorable
conditions, the grass may be
stocked within six weeks of
sowing, and sheep and cattle
can eat it to ground-level with
little waste through trampling.
For best results prepare the
land as for wheat; good stands,
however, are obtained by

apart, if it’s sown alone. The
C.S.LR.O. recommends a
50-50 mixture of the sorghum
and improved-pasture legumes,
sown 41b. an acre. In poor soil,
yields will be improved by
2cwt. superphosphate.
As with all sorghums, there's
danger of poisoning from a
crop which is stunted or
withered by drought, or if
hungry animals are turned-in.
When made into hay, though,
the grass is unlikely to be
harmful.
Since the grass is all that
the C.5.1.R.0. claims, the
logical course seems to be to
lift the embargo.
Leaf-eating Weevil
“Wilga”: Queensland citrus-
growers don’t have to contend
with rice-weevils (B. 10/6/’59),
but the citrus leaf-eating weevil
is a close relation. About |in.
long and greyish-brown in
color, it certainly flies —which
the rice-weevil doesn’t.
Attacking the leaves, it
destroys tissue, weakens the
tree and injures young fruit.
Clean cultivation beneath the
trees will keep the pest down
in its early stages, and spray-
ing with D.D.T.-emulsion, at
0.1 strength, will control the
adult insect.
Lucerne
“Billjim”: When such weeds
as fat-hen infest lucerne the
most effective remedy, least
damaging to the lucerne, is
2, 4-D-B. It should be sprayed
at an early stage of growth,
provided there’s complete
ground-cover, at a rate of lib.
acid to the acre.
For established stands,
dalapon at rates up to 51b. an
acre in 20gals. water is good
against Yorkshire-fog, brown-
top, creeping-bent and rye-
grass. For perennial-rye, rates
may be stepped-up to 71b. an
acre; this will not give 100-
per-cent. control, but if higher
rates are used the lucerne is
likely to suffer lasting damage.
Best time for using dalapon is
early spring, when there’s the
minimum growth of foliage.
“Myall”: Results on T. W.
Nation’s property, situated on
the Moonie River, 10 miles
from Tara in the western
Darling Downs, give some idea
of the productivity of Queens-
land’s brigalow-belt. Here
there’s black brigalow-loam
along the river-bank and a
light - reddish soil further
inland, with the depth of top-
soil between 8in. and 12in. over
a moist clay loam.
Before 1957, 600 acres of
wheat and oats were grown
annually for grazing, but in
that year 200 acres of lucerne
were sown at the rate of 21b.
an acre, with 101b. oats as a
cover-crop. Sowing oats with
lucerne provides a body of
fodder for quick grazing and
checks the growth of grass
until the lucerne is established.
In spite of dry weather, cattle
were grazed in August. A
further 185 acres were sown
the following May and 15
more in June—a total of 400
acres in all.
The 15-acre plot was first
grazed, then 30 bales of hay
to the acre were cut from it
the following January and 70
bales an acre in March. The
crop was mowed again in early
May. In two years 500 fat-
cattle and 900 fat-lambs have
been turned-off annually, 4000
bales of hay have been
shedded, 800 bales laid-down
as silage and a quantity sold
for local consumption. An
80-acre paddock has been
allowed to seed, and a yield of
3001b. an acre is expected.
Preparation of the ground
begins with 5in.-deep plough-
ing in November. Further
working depends on rainfall ;
the aim is to ensure that weeds
are controlled, moisture con-
served and the soil worked to
a fine friable condition by early
May. To date no fertiliser has
been used on the property.
“Gilgai”: Lucerne was once
thought suitable only for rich
river-flats, but it’s now thriving
in almost every kind of soil
and under rainfall as low as
Min.
However, on self-mulching
red and black myall-belar
country south of Narromine
(N.S.W.) the plant has not done
well. We have sown lucerne
for the last 10 years and have
had many good strikes ; but no
matter how good the strike,
within two years there’s very
little lucerne left.
The reasons it does badly
seem to be: waterlogging in the
wet seasons of the last 10
years, and then the breaking-
up and desiccation of the
lucerne-roots when the ground
cracks open in summer.
Queensland Cotion
“Myall”: Figures lately
released show Queensland’s
1958-59 yield of 6000 bales of
cotton to be double that of the
previous season, but still only
6| per cent, of Australia’s
requirements.
About 90,000 bales, valued
at £6 million, are imported
annually, in addition to
cotton piecegoods and textiles
worth almost £5O million, so
there’s no likelihood •of [he
home-market being over-
supplied for many years.
Three years ago the Cotton
Board, in conjunction with the
Department of Agriculture,
opened a determined campaign
to revive cotton-growing in all
parts of the State. Last year
the uncertainty of the pearl-
shell industry induced abori-
gines at the Lockhart River
Mission on Cape York to sow
100 acres of cotton. This will
be increased to 500 acres for
the coming planting and 1000
for 1960. Tobacco-farmers on
the Atherton Tableland —■
where farms are irrigated—are
planting experimental areas,
and when the Tinaroo Falls
scheme is completed a large
area will be sown to the crop
there. In non-irrigated dist-
ricts, also, farmers intend to
sow small trial-areas, and,
generally, cotton could be get-
ting a new lease of life in
Queensland.

(From “J.C.W.”): Another use
of the humble onion, apart from
the uses listed in the “Service
Department” (B. 22/7/’59), was as
a cure for scurvy. This is men-
tioned by Richard Henry Dana,
jnr., in his book Two Years Before
the Mast. After a hazardous trip
round Cape Horn the sailing-vessel,
coming into a more northerly lati-
tude on its way to Boston, haile'd
a passing vessel out from that port.
Fresh supplies 6f both onions and
potatoes were obtained, and men
sick with scurvy were cured by
drinking the juice of these two
vegetables. Those not ill with
scurvy kept supplies of onions
handy. They ate them like fruit
and benefited greatly in health.

r Information Sought
Some information about Mother
Shipton ?
A reputed witch and prophetess
who is supposed to have lived in
15th-century England, her maiden-
name was either Ursula Southill,
Sowthiel or Southiel; she is said
to have been born about 1486-88
at Knaresborough (Yorkshire), her
parents being humble peasants.
Her mother, Agatha, was a reputed
witch who consorted with the
Devil, and Ursula, who was very
ugly, was regarded as “the Devil’s
child.” When about 24 she mar-
ried Tobias Shipton, a builder, of
York, and lived to a ripe old age.
Her most sensational prophecies
had to do with Cardinal Wolsey,
Lord Percy and other men pro-
minent at the Court of Henry VIII.
“ Clean-up Week starts tomorrow. I'd advise you not
to leave your car outside tonight
According to the Encyclopcedia
Britamuca, there is no really trust-
worthy evidence that she lived, but
her alleged prophecies had an extra-
ordinary hold on the popular
imagination. The suggestion that
Mother Shipton had foretold the
end of the world in 1881 caused
a panic in that year; but that
prophecy was established as a for-
gery by one Charles Hindley, who
in 1862 had published a garbled
version of Richard Head’s The Life
and Death of Mother Shipton
(1667).

Where does the term “Granny
Smith” apple come from ?
The apple was first cultivated by,
and named after, Maria Ann Smith,
who lived at Eastwood (Sydney)
in the 1860’s. In 1868 Mrs. Smith
asked a man named E. H. Small
to look at a seedling apple grow-
ing on her property and bearing
some fine specimens of fruit. Small
tested a sample and declared the
fruit to have good cooking-
possibilities. Mrs. Smith then
worked a few trees, and subse-
quently Edward Gallard, a member
of the family, planted-out a fairly
large bed and marketed a crop
annually. Meanwhile Mrs. Smith
revealed that she had bought some
gin-cases containing remains of
Tasmanian apples and that she had
tipped them out near a creek;
hence the novel specimen. Mrs.
Smith’s apple was cultivated to
some extent in the Parramatta dis-
trict in the early 1890’s; a large-
scale planting was made at a
Government experimental station at
Bathurst in 1895. At this time
the apple was referred to, in the
“Agricultural Gazette,” as “Granny
Smith’s seedling, a New South
Wales seedling raised from the seed
of a French Crab near Ryde.” A
public reserve at Eastwood, near
the site of Mrs. Smith’s former
property, was named in 1950 the
Granny Smith Memorial Park.

Oscar Levant, on KLP 806,
makes Gershwin sound excit-
ingly easy, even though one’s
pocket-score indicates that
Gershwin is otherwise. Assisted
by Ormandy and the Phila-
delphia, he scuttles through
“Rhapsody in Blue,” that un-
inhibited slab of cross-
rhythms ; pauses to let Artur
Rodzinski conduct the New
York Philharmonic in “An
American in Paris” (divorced
from the film, it tends to fall
a little flat) and he bounces
back on the reverse-side with
the “Concerto in F,” backed
by Andre Kostelanetz and the
New York people.
This concerto is probably the
most significant piece of Ger-
shwiniana; it has a bigger,
bolder style than the Rhapsody,
and the score shows, despite
Levant’s feathery lightness,
that Gershwin expects the
soloist to be, if not a virtuoso
pianist, at least a topliner
among nightclub men—some-
one. mavbe, like a New York
negro pianist whom Egon
Petri, the famous teacher of

I could play like that!”
In the long allegro first-
movement orchestral balance
generally matches the crisp
piano-playing but, 66 bars
after the key goes to D Flat
Major, the piano chords in the
next eight bars, marked ff, are
virtually submerged. Perhaps
this is because the orchestral
part has a similar dynamic
marking, in which case it’s a
compositional fault. At any
rate, the andante second move-
ment, even taking into account
the roaring crescendo near the
end, leaves you in good form
for the thunderbolts of the
allegro.
Benny in Brussels (KLP
757-8 ; two disks) should appeal
not only to Benny Goodman’s
fans but to anyone interested in
cleanly, at times brilliantly,
played jazz. Material is drawn
from Benny’s Brussels Fair,
1958, appearances; first a
short number, to warm-up,
then something cool (“Don’t
Be That Way”) followed
by the even coolah “Halle-
lujah,” in which Good-
man’s clarinet slithers and
pirouettes above Hanna’s piano
and the brush-drums ; then an
involved, but beautifully
managed, extempore break for
piano; then Goodman again
. . „ Jimmy Rushing, the negro
singer plugged alongside Benny
on the jacket, puts enormous
vim into “Mr. Five by Five.”
Finally, on KLP 771, The
Broadway Kick, Frank Sinatra
sings numbers from Broadway
musicals. One has the feeling
that maybe Frankie is running
short of material; among the
songs which he wraps-up
neatly and coats with Sinatra
syncopation are “There’s No
Business Like Show Business,”
“The Girl That I Marry,”
“Bali Ha’i” and “Some En-
chanted Evening.” A teenager
disk, pleasantly light, musically
uncomplicated.

“Talkabout”
Billed as “Australia’s Cham-
pion Earbashers,” Bill Harney
and Alan Marshall provide no
justification in “Talkabout”
(POL 017, a Score record from
the Victorian Peter Mann
studio) for Harney’s contention
that the only way to stop him
talking is to put an alarm-clock
on him. You can almost hear
him listening while Alan Mar-
shall tells three stories in a
row —but of course someone
may have been standing over
them with a baseball-bat or a
pistol fitted with a silencer ; or
maybe they’ve found how to
fit a silencer on Australian-
bush talkers.
As though the “Aborigin-
alities” page had been vacci-
nated with a gramophone-
needle, the discussion deals with
the softening of boots with
goanna-oil and with cabbage-
water ; the horseman who
caught his arm in a tree and cut
it off with his knife; Black
Andy, who carried, or maybe
didn’t, half-a-ton ; bush cooks
who had to be pugs, and what
happened when the boys
brought a boxer up from town
to settle the cook’s hash;
Speewah stories, such as the
one about the woman with the
wooden leg it took two men
six weeks to paint; and the
child who said “We’re going
to have jam-roll today—Mum’s
only wearing one sock.”
It’s very good bush-talk until
towards the end of the first
side, where Harney gets on to
aborigines, their legends,
music and poetry —and then
it becomes superb: Harney
talking con amore on abos. is
unequalled in the world, and
when he mimics them it’s as
though he’d brought them into
the studio.
No bushman need go mad
now jusf because he’s lonely ;
at the end of the day he can
take out his transistor radio-
gram and this record, and
Harney and Marshall will talk
him silly.

Women's Letters
SYDNEY
“Sweeter Than Springtime Are You”
—everybody seems to be humming the
tune, especially since Princess Alexandra
arrived at Canberra and provided the
most popular conversation-theme with
her charming friendliness, her good looks
—and her hat!
It was definitely the right theme-
song for the R.S.L. 15th Victory Ball
when 21 pretty girls, all daughters of
ex-servicemen, made one of the most
charming deb.-sets ever seen at the
Trocadero, as, dressed in Victorian-style
white gowns, and each carrying a fan
of ruffled tulle mounted on flower-sprays,
they made their curtsy to the Governor,
Sir Eric Woodward. The debutantes
were sisters Jacqueline and Robyn
Hunter, and Rae and Barbara Swan,
Beverley Jones, Barbara Gosper, Kerry
Hyde, Audrey Collins, Sandra Schofield,
Lorraine Jones, Antoinette Northam,
Jacqueline Pitt, Ann Jackson, Margaret
Conerbeare, Margaret Pell, Elizabeth
Jarrett, Lyndall Forrest-Brown, Elaine
Hooke, Adrianne Perry, Diane McLean
and Elizabeth Rodda. They were pre-
sented by Sister Gloria Park, Women’s
Services State councillor, and made their
entrance through a pergola of pink and
white rosebuds, escorted by Army
nursing-sisters in red capes and white
veils.
Decorations were unusually beautiful.
A canopy of blue and gold streamers
stretched over the ballroom, where white
satin banners depicted in gold letters the
battles of the two wars. Thousands of
gold flags and bowls of daffodils decor-
ated the tables, around which more than
1500 people sat. Among them were
many country members of the R.S.L.
who had been delegates at the annual
conference.

There need be no ugly-ducklings this
spring, since hairdressers and milliners
have entered into friendly conspiracy and
wrought transformations and coiffures
both startling and glamorous, the results
of which evoked much applause from an
audience at the Australia last week,
when it was shown as the new hair-style
launched in Paris a few days ago. This
function was in aid of the Royal Blind
Society and organised by the Lions
Club.
The swan-line of the hairdo is created
with thickness at the sides, flat top
(which doesn’t get ruined if a hat is
worn), a smooth, long backline which
tapers to a “tail” low on the neck.
(Incidentally, it was divulged that two
of the most beautiful women in the
world, Vivien Leigh and Grace Kelly,
have very long necklines.) One of the
most glamorous effects was produced in
“Swan Lake,” when the model’s hair
was tinted Paris-pink to match her
nail-polish and decorated for evening-
wear with paste ornaments and sequins.
Rather reminiscent of the early-
Georgian era was the high-dressed head,
on which a topknot of feathers and orna-
ments was worn. A startling effect was
created by a vivid-green tint, which
matched exactly the satin shoes of the
wearer. “Enchanted Evening” and
“Swan Song” were as charming and
romantic as their names suggested, and
the new color-rinses could reassure even
those who before would “never say
dye” that they don’t have to put-up
with faded and ugly hair (of the hue
dubbed “dishwater-blonde”), but can
change their coloring quite easily and
subtly in a matter of moments.
Dr. Philomena McGrath, who is to
marry Dr. John Morgan at Our Lady
of the Rosary Church, Kensington, on
Saturday next, is the youngest woman
doctor to be admitted to the Royal Aus-
tralasian College of Surgeons. She gained
this distinction last May and at the same
time her fiance became a member of the
Royal Australian College of Physicians.
Early in January the two plan to leave
for England, where they will continue
their studies. Dr. McGrath is the elder
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. R. McGrath,
of Kingsford, and her sister, Elizabeth,
will be her bridesmaid. Best man will
be Dr. Gerald Morgan, brother of the
bridegroom, whose parents are Mr. and
Mrs. J. V. Morgan, of Dubbo.
Mention of swans, of course, inevit-
ably brings to mind the unforgettable
artistry of the Bolshoi Ballet, which
provided the social highlight of one of
the gayest weeks of the season, and left
the packed audience at the Elizabethan
Theatre premiere almost too carried-
away with its beauty to move in their
seats. The Governor and Lady Wood-
ward were in the official party with the
Premier and Mrs. Cahill, and dressing
was an outstanding feature ; many long
evening-gowns were seen, as well as
ballerina-length, and some that were
obviously part of the wardrobe designed
for Royal-tour wear. Mrs. Tom Bate-
man (there with her doctor-husband)
was a vivid figure in a petunia-red satin
theatre-coat which she wore over a Dior-
model of white-and-silver brocades. A
diamond crown-brooch, mounted on red
velvet, was pinned at the shoulder. Mrs.
Alexis Albert’s short mink jacket was
worn over a ballerina-length black
gown. Mrs. James Mills looked charm-
ing in blue-spotted white chiffons, made
with a tiered and harem-line skirt,
while Mrs. Peter Broughton’s white
chiffon was slim-fitting and draped.
An elegant chartreuse“satin gown worn
by Mrs. Walter Bunning was made with
a slight train, the back fullness of 'the
skirt being caught below the waist with
small bows. An effective contrast was
her long stole of bronze-shot satin.
Another striking full-length gown was
the off-white satin worn by Mrs. H. H.
Buchanan, which was cut on slim lines
and swirled into fullness at the ankles.
Jean Walker’s pretty blue silk dress was
offset by a Paris-pink stole. Two Mel-
bourne women seen were Bambi Shmith,
whose slim sheath of ink-blue silk was
cut low at the back and had a small bow
as trimming at the waistline ; and Nono
Ryan, who had flown up to welcome
home her sister and brother-in-law, Mr.
and Mrs. J. J. Watson, of Beauty Point,
who returned on Sunday from a round-
the-world trip by air.

The monthly meeting of the Lady
Mayoress’s Relief Fund committee, held
at the Town Hall last week, afterwards
took the form of a delightful musicale.
The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. H. F. Jensen,
welcomed more than 250 guests in the
flower-decked vestibule of the Town
Hall. Guest-of-honor was Mrs. J. J.
Cahill, wife of the Premier. The musical
programme, which was arranged by Mrs.
W. Hope H. Gibson, included items by
Hazel Reader, Barry Gibbons, Josephine
Bell and Alan Light.

MELBOURNE
With a gale howling down Collins
Street and icy rain beating against the
windows, mannequins in the salon of
the House of Shave paraded in the latest
spring fashions. Beginning with knit-
wear, which has now become a smart
feature in any woman’s budget, the range
included styles for day, after-five and
evening, and there were slim jackets,
delightfully-cut suits and. elegant jumpers
for dining and dancing. A slimly-cut
knitted suit, Italian-inspired, showed a
skirt slit at each side ; the jacket had
the new dropped-shoulderline, and very
clever was the introduction of a con-
trasting stitch for the tuxedo collar and
revers. This suit was knitted in mist-
grey wool.
How the basic black frock takes-on
a new air with the addition of various
jumpers was also shown in this parade.
First, the frock was topped with a
seaweed - green steel - beaded jumper.
Next, a charcoal-grey embroidered in
white-bead narcissus, and finally a
pastel-blue sweater banded with crystal
beads. This sweater was 70 per cent,
lamb’s-wool and 30 per cent, angora-
rabbit. From the Italian fashion-house
of Mirsa came a simple, smart, black
evening-sweater, with short sleeves and
a darted waistline. A beautifully
embroidered band of pearls and gold-
filigree emphasised the round neckline,
and was worn with an elegant black skirt.
Other clever innovations included a
royal-blue wool frock made with a draped
overskirt, which when removed revealed
a simple, slim sheath-frock. Similar
treatment was given to a sheath-frock
which featured a heavily-beaded back-
panel on the skirt; when the panel was
removed there was a straight, basic
frock.
One of the most striking ensembles in
the parade was a flame wool-tweed coat,
with a tuxedo front and full balloon-
sleeves. Under it was worn a frock, a
sheath in flame cotton patterned in white.
Gowns for the visit of Princess Alexandra
included a bright cornflower-blue chiffon
cut on Grecian lines and featuring a
floating back-panel and halter-neckline.
Another model showed a white-satin
gown, strapless and ankle-length in front,
with the bodice swathed into the waist,
with the fullness in the skirt at the
back and floor-length. “Infanta” was
the name given to a grey-lace gown
which had long sleeves, a deep rounded
back, decollete, and ankle-length three-
tiered skirt.

Accompanied by his wife, Robin
Bailey was guest-speaker at the monthly
luncheon of the Royal Commonwealth
Society, and he was both grave and gay
in 'his short talk to members. After
telling something of his career (he men-
tioned having been in four plays in one
year: the first lasted three nights, the
second 10, the third didn’t open, and the
fourth was successful), he did a very
witty critique on “My Fair Lady.” This,
supposedly by a former Army colonel,
was in answer to those who believed “The
Summer of the 17th Doll” and .“The
Shifting Heart” shouldn’t have been
shown outside Australia. Among those
who enjoyed this unusual talk was Mrs.
Edward Turner (her daughter plays
Eliza to Robin’s Professor Higgins).
Official guests were received by the
chairman, Sir Horace Robertson, and
included Mrs. Claude Couchman,
Brigadier and Mrs. Ray Tovell, Mr. and
Mrs. F. J. Lean and Mr. T. Thornton
Ward. Others present included Mrs.
H. G. Connell, Colonel and Mrs. A.
Stewart, and the Misses Annie Danks
and Eileen Heden
There will be many who remember
the vivacious songster Marie Bremner,
star of “The Desert Song,” “New Moon”
and a revival of “The Belle of New
York.” Marie also was seen and heard
in numerous Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Now Mrs. Ewart Chappie (her husband
is Victorian manager for the A.8.C.),
Marie, though no longer gracing the
stage, is sometimes heard over the air.
Kept busy acting as hostess for her
husband to the various touring celebrities,
she is often to be heard addressing
members of hospital-auxiliaries and
mothers’ clubs (for welfare of school-
children), always finishing her talks with
a few of her well-known songs.
The white flowers which decorated the
altar and chancel of St. John’s Church,
Toorak, for the wedding of Carmen
Sandra, eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Trevor Clarke, of Devon Park, Dunkeld,
made a nice matching with the white
gowns worn by the bride and attendants.
Given away by her father, the tall, lovely
Carmen wore a long-sleeved gown of
chalk-white Dior satin; the skirt was
bell-shaped in front, and the fullness
at the back was caught in folds by a
bow at the waistline. The long tulle
veil was held at the back with a half-
circle of orange-blossom, which also
formed the posy. Attendants were the
bride’s sisters Sylvia and Georgina, Eve
Grimwade, Sally Manifold and Judith
Ritchie. Their long gowns were of
chalk-white pure-silk, the bodices featur-
ing scooped-necklines and three-quarter-
length sleeves. The high cummerbunds
at the waist were of milk-coffee silk, and
continued from the waist at the back in a
wide panel to be caqght at the hem
of the skirt. In their hair were coronets
of palest-pink and white flowers, and
their bouquets were of white blossom,
gardenias and pale-pink japonica. The
bridegroom, Roderick Howard, only son
of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Carnegie, of
Kildrummie, Holbrook (N.S.W.), had
Peter Brookes as best man. Grooms-
men were Richard Todd, David
McGlashen and Andrew Grimwade.
The reception was held at the Toorak
home of the bride’s grandmother, Mrs.
Edward Shackell. Mrs. Trevor Clarke
chose a full coat of royal-blue velvet
with a matching hat, and Mrs. Carnegie
also wore velvet, hers being in forest-
green tonings. This was a wedding of
wide country interest, with guests (almost
300) coming in the main from the
Riverina and Western District. The
reception had the prettiest background,
for the marquee, erected in the garden,
was set around trees in full blossom.

Original and amusing were the decora-
tions at Ciro’s when Mrs. G. C. (Bing)
Molyneux and her committee organised
a dinner-dance to assist the funds of
St. Vincent’s Hospital maternity-wing.
Spaced along the individual tables were
squat green cacti (looking like cabbages)
which had been frosted, and embedded
in the centre of each was a tiny pink
baby-doll. Huge urns of colorful spring
flowers were in the foyer and on the
orchestra-stand. With her husband, who
is Consul for the Philippines, Mrs.
Molyneux received the guests wearing a
short, bouffant frock of black silk-taffeta
patterned with brown flowers. Members
of the committee present were Mrs. John
Connell (wearing black Chantilly-lace
over white taffeta), Mrs. Desmond Holly-
wood (whose choice was a frock of
bright-blue taffeta), Mrs. Jim Peters (in
royal-blue faille), and Mrs. Peter Kier-

Mrs. Leslie Smith and Mrs. H. I.

course, an illusion. At Bukkiana, if
you are not picking the telephone
out of your ear as you are in
Sydney, you are pulling the choko-
vines out of your hair. The day, every-
where, needs to be 48 hours long; that
is the real difficulty. But. as Mrs. von
Bertouch most hopefully shows, it is
not altogether an illusion: they did at
least do well out of the prawns, they
did live —and she did, somehow, find
time to write this massive and delight-
ful book.
It is surprisingly good, once you
have come to accept the characters
at her own high valuation, as a
picture of married love: mature,
intimate, witty, amusing and sympa-
thetic; with none of the stresses and
strains of a D. H. Lawrence novel,
without the slightest touch of lush-
ness, yet depicting the whole thing
with a natural frankness which few
novelists, however daring they may
think they are, have been able to
achieve. I can’t remember any other
novelist, for instance, except Aldous
Huxley in “Point Counter Point,” who
has been able to describe anything
so charming and commonplace as a
couple taking a bath together; and
Huxley did it, of course, in a spirit
of scarifying satire—the very opposite
of Mrs. von Bertouch’s amusing
conversation-piece.
And finally—before the prawns—it
is pretty good, though it could be
better in this respect if Mrs. von Ber-
touch felt as free to look into other
people’s lives as she has into the
Rokebys’, as a picture of the com-
munity of river and lake: some
comedies and some tragedies, a few
legends and eccentrics, mostly that
pleasant, neighborly life where people
give each other feeds of oysters, grapes,
persimmons and peaches in exchange
for a feed of prawns; and where, when
the big rush of prawns is on, a dozen
fishermen will turn-up to help the lucky
man who has the “shot” at the outlet.
But, all in all, it is the prawns that
make the book. It is new territory in
Australian writing—new at any rate
so far as I can recall—and Mrs. von
Bertouch gives you the whole story;
and not from the outside, a mere list
of facts and statistics, the way a
journalist might do it, but from the
inside, as part of the Rokebys’ life;
out on the water with the nets. I
must say that, in her passion for
detail, Mrs. von Bertouch takes about
ten pages to explain the system of
“bidding” by which the prawn-fisher-
men get their turn in the best position
at the entrance, and then I didn’t fully
understand it until about forty pages
further on, but you just have to take
some rather cumbrous detail if you
are going to take this book; and it
would be a pity to miss it.
The real point about the prawns is
not just that they are a fascinating
subject but that they make the
emotional and dramatic climax of the
book; everything leads up to the one
big night near the end when the
Rokebys strike it lucky—box after
box of them, thirty-three boxes all
told, prawns by the million. Here,
while the men are still hauling them
into the boat from the net at the
entrance, is Mrs. Rokeby cooking
some of them:—
The stars shone unnoticed in the
clearing sky, the trees loomed up
and in and over the fire, closing it
in an airy cocoon against the night,
the river slid black and soft towards
the sea, its waters full of life, people
moved, people spoke, a lamp bobbed
along the darkness, the breeze
sighed ; but here were only the
black-runged pot, seething and jump-
ing on its fiery bed, the scoop, turn-
ing and lifting, the crackle and rush
of prawns, alive, translucent, jewel-
eyed, or dead, shining pink and jet-
eyed, Buster, dependable and calm,
Davy, young and inscrutable, Helen,
excited and hasty, the sloping racks
of prawns and flying handfuls of
crunched salt shining like crystal,
boxes, baskets, slippery ground, the
circle of light, the uneven planks
hidden under a glaze of water, and
weight, weight, weight.... At last
when the lifting was becoming
intolerable, suddenly everything was
finished. Five hundredweight of
prawns had been cooked, cooled,
spread, salted and stacked in ten
boxes. The bewildering rush was
over. All six baskets were empty.
The ground had been tramped to
mud, the bank worn to a smooth,
wildly slippery slope a-run with
water, and there was nothing to do.
When she came into “The Bulletin”
office Mrs. von Bertouch was a bit
disappointed with the reception her
book had had in Sydney. Few copies
were on display in the bookshops; the
reviews had been sparse.
How many authors have had, with
justice, the same lamentation to make!
There could be some special reasons
for it this time. The dustjacket is
rather drab. The title, though actually
it is a prawners’ term for the full-
moon period, /sounds faintly sinister
and uninviting. The book is presented
as a novel and there is little to indi-
cate to the public that it should really
be read as a magnificent documentary
on prawning and the simple life
generally on the northern New South
Wales lakes. But, if thirty-three
boxes of prawns, and all that goes
with them here, don’t deserve to make
a splash in this town —and anywhere
else in Australia or overseas—l don’t
know what does.

Malayan Romance
In Fools of Time (Hale) the Aus-
tralian novelist Nourma Handford
makes a romance of postwar excite-
ment on a rubber-plantation in
Malaya; a bit old-fashioned in treat-
ment, but then, romance is always a
bit old-fashioned, especially today.
It begins during the war, when two
young British officers rescue the little
daughter of an English doctor from
the Japanese, putting her in a Malayan
convent. After the war the girl meets
and marries one of the officers. Her
sister, who has become a night-club
singer in England, is touring Malaya
and has met the other young officer,
they have an intense love-affair, and
then she leaves him for an Eastern
concert-agent.
So he goes to work on the other
officer’s plantation; and there, visiting
her married sister, the singing girl
finds him. There is intrigue and shoot-
ing of Communists; the singer tries to
regain her former lover’s affections,
and at last, on a tiger-hunt, manages
to do this; but, alas, it all ends
unhappily.
All of which might seem rather trite
if it were not helped-out by the author’s
easy and colorful presentation of
Malaya, both town and country: she
has travelled in the East and hunted
big game in Malaya.
New Zealand Story
New Zealand publishers have
specialised lately in historical letters,
diaries and autobiographies and have
unearthed in them a very rich and
rewarding lot of stuff. Perhaps inspired
by the success of these mining-opera-
tions, Pegasus Press has presented in
Ivy Preston’s The Silver Stream a piece
of contemporary history which has, or
purports to have, precisely the sort of
value and interest you find in docu-
ments of the past.
In a sense “The Silver Stream” might
be regarded just as any other con-
temporary autobiography. It is Mrs.
Preston’s life-story from her child-
hood on a small farm in South Canter-
bury up to the tragic deaths of her
sister and her husband in 1956. But
it is not a distinguished autobiography;
not of exceptional romantic and
adventurous interest as was “Musterers
on Molesworth”; and it is chiefly to be
valued, just as are most historical
diaries, as a picture of the everyday
life of the period.
Parts of it are of only the slightest
contemporary interest, at any rate to
New Zealanders. We all know that
World War II took place, and was
ended in the Pacific by the atom-
bomb. New Zealanders all know
what ordinary tourist-trips to Rotorua
or the Sounds are like. Yet these are
the things that, when a hundred years

have passed over them (and if there
are not too many other surviving docu-
ments recording the same events and
describing the same sort of life),
become fascinating: a picture of
ordinaty New Zealand life in the far-
off Twentieth Century.
Other parts have more intrinsic
literary interest, whether for the pre-
sent time or the future. Mrs. Preston
describes her childhood, always the
best material for autobiography be-
cause it has already acquired the
patina of time, with much charm and
warmth: how the children milked
eight cows (by hand in the freezing
paddocks) before breakfast; how the
car caught fire; how she thought the
devil lived under her bed; how they
went poaching trout; how she liked to
live up a tree; and so on. There are
good chapters, too, describing dances,’
parties and housework on remote farms
in her youth and her early life on the
farm with her husband; and if some
of the episodes—how to cook a pud-
ding, for instance—are chiefly of
feminine interest, even a male reader
can share her fears and relief when
the children are found, after all, not
to be drowned in the creek. The final
chapters, as she fights through her
tragedies and griefs, are deeply
moving.
Thus, with its special emphases in
various directions, the book does
amount to a representative New Zea-
land life-story of the period. With
some lapses into what is hardly more
than women’s-magazine writing, it
reads interestingly now; but, if chance
and the curious selectivity of time pre-
served it, it would read all the better
when a hundred years had smoothed its
raw edges and given a fresh signific-
ance to its history.
Exploration in Sarawak
In 1955 an Oxford University Expe-
dition spent six months in Borneo on
the Usun Apau, a tableland —mostly
unexplored—which lies in the head-
waters of the Rejang, Sarawak’s largest
river. The expedition numbered four:
archaeologist, zoologist, forester and
geologist. Guy Arnold, archaeologist
and leader, has written the story of
their journey of exploration in Long-
house and Jungle (Chatto and Windus).
Unlike many explorers’ tales, this is
not a recital of unforeseen disasters.
There were certainly difficulties of
communication and, to supplement
supplies carried by porters, the R.A.F.
had to provide two airdrops. But
these four young men planned the
journey beforehand, and, consequently,
when they set-out, the expedition was
well-found and properly organised—•
and they knew just when and where
the airdrops would come down. So
they were able to range over an area
of 600 square-miles of almost unknown
country, excavate deserted longhouse-
village sites and record folk-stories as
well as making a geological survey and
collecting zoological and botanical
specimens.
They studied the nomadic Penans,
who, “among the wildest and most
remote people in Sarawak,”
live entirely by foodgathering and
hunting ; they will stay in one place
for three months or a year until
they have exhausted the wild sago
and fruit of the area and driven all
the game away.... .They are power-
fully built, and, unlike the Kayans,
of variable height, from nearly six
feet to short and stocky. Their skin
is lighter in color than that of any
other Borneo people.
With such a shy and unforthcom-
ing people, it is hard to be definite
about their beliefs and customs,
which are unorganised and vague
I came across many simple
designs carved on trees or fallen •
trunks along the Penan paths. When-
ever I asked the reason for them,
the answer was always: “In play.”
Later these shy people became more
friendly, but they never approached the
less inhibited hospitality with which
other tribes entertained the strangers
from Oxford —singing, dancing and
drinking most of the night.
Among the Sebops, for instance,
Arnold recounts how;—
Outside the girls started dancing,
and after a while the two who had
so persistently asked me to take
their photographs came and dragged
me off to join-in down the dimly-
lit long gallery. The four reluctant
Indonesians were also forced to
dance, and we kept it up for two
exhausting hours. More and more
bottles were brought out, the sapehs
strummed steadily, the singing and
talking became louder and more
disjointed. Madang then sang me
a song that lasted for half an hour,
verse after verse, telling the story
of our travels. Lian at my elbow
translated, while 60 or so men, sitting
in a tightly-packed circle round us,
growled a magnificent chorus.
Arnold’s story is full of human and
scientific detail set out in a way that
is easy to read. There is something
here to interest most people and a lot
to interest Australian readers. After
all, Borneo isn’t so very far north.
THE BALLAD OF UNCLE JOCK
Oh Jock the Scot my uncle was,
Who sailed away to sea
Across the width of Spencer’s Gulf
And never home came he.
No far, romantic, tropic shores
Bury my Uncle Jock;
His ship went down in sight of home —
It gave us all a shock
To think the Gulf that looked so tame ,
So innocent and blue,
Could swallow a sturdy schooner down
And drown her company too.
No floating wreckage came ashore,
No stick nor spar was seen;
“Penelope” vanished into the air
As though she’d never been . . .
Four lonely widows waited long,
Hoping they still were wives;
Between Port Hughes and Tumby Bay
Their husbands lost'-their lives.
And some were washed ashore at last,
But Jock was never found.
Beneath the weeds of Spencer’s Gulf
The current rolled him round
And as the fishes picked his bones
His skeleton fell apart.
In a rockpool once I found the red
Anemone of his heart.
