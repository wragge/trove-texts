J ICHFIELD, 116 miles from London,
in Staffordshire, is famous for its
associations with the irrepressible Dr.
Johnson, who was born here in 1709.
The graceful Lichfield cathedral, one
of the smaller English cathedrals, is surely
one of the most beautiful, and is built
of locally quarried red sandstone. Apart
from modern restorations, it is an early
English and decorated edifice of the 13th
and 14th centuries, though the earliest
parts of the cathedral date from the 12th
century. . The cathedral is dedicated to
St. Mary and St. Chad, and the history
of its site began in 700, when Bishop
Hedda erected the first church here, but
there are no visible remains of this or of
the Norman church that succeeded it.
In 1643 the fortified Close, garrisoned
by Royalists, was captured by the Parlia-
mentarians after a three days’ siege. It
was again besieged in 1646, when the
central spire was demolished and much
damage done to the interior. Sir
Christopher Wren, the architect of St.
Paul’s, London, is reputed to have re-
stored the central spire. Thorough
restoration was begun in 1856 under Sir
Gilbert Scott.
In the south transept may be seen
memorial busts of Johnson and Garrick,
both of whom were buried in West-
minster Abbey. There is also a fine
monument of Admiral Sir William
Parker (d. 1866), the last survivor of Nel-
son’s captains. Here also may be seen a
medallion to Erasmus Darwin (1731-
1802), the grandfather of Charles Darwin.
In the Lady Chapel is the effigy of
Bishop Selwyn (d. 1878), of New Zea-
land and afterwards of Lichfield. Among
the treasures in the library are the Gos-
pels of St. Chad (7th century), a fine
manuscript of The Canterbury Tales,
many rare Bibles and a copy of South’s
Sermons, used by Dr, Johnson in the
compilation of his dictionary.

ELIOT ON CULTURE .
T, S. Eliot’s Notes Towards the Defi-
nition of Culture (Faber) is a long essay
to which is added the text of two broad-
cast talks to the German people.
Mr. Eliot, in his mild way, must have
considerably confounded many of his
German listeners. His talks were chiefly
designed to point out that a national
culture does not originate and cannot
survive in isolation, and while his audi-
ence may have been prepared to accept
his analysis of the interweaving of cul-
tural influences within Europe;
In the second half of the nineteenth cen-
tury the greatest contribution to European
poetry was certainly made by France. I
refer to the tradition which started with
Baudelaire, and culminates in Paul
Valery. I venture to say that without this
French tradition the work of three poets in
other languages—and three very different
from each other —I refer to W. B. Yeats,
to Rainer Maria Rilke, and, if I may, to
myself—would be hardly conceivable. And,
so complicated are these literary influences,
we must remember that this French move-
ment itself owed a good deal to an Ameri-
can of Irish extraction: Edgar Allan Poe —
it must have been startling for minds
confused by Nazism to be reminded that
“The Western world has its unity in....
the ancient civilisations of Greece, Rome
and Israel, from which, owing to two
thousand years of Christianity, we trace
our descent.” Mr. Eliot twice uses the
word “Israel” when discussing the
sources of our civilisation, and to very
good effect.
His references to Christianity touch
on the fundamental theme of his essay,
which is that; “No culture has appeared
or developed except together with a re-
ligion : according to the point of view of
the observer, the culture will appear to
be the product of the religion, or the re-
ligion the product of the culture.” He
believes that European culture is “ob-
viously in decline,” and he relates that
decline, of course, to the decline of
Christianity, He is not, he asserts, out to
secure converts to the Christian faith: he
is “simply stating a fact.”
As he defines and uses the term, “cul-
ture” has a very wide meaning: “It in-
cludes all the characteristic activities and
interests of a people; Derby Day... .the
dart-board.... boiled cabbage cut into
sections..... nineteenth - century Gothic
churches.... the reader can make his own
list.” The term is used, in short, rather
as the anthropologists use it, meaning the
whole way of life of a people, and Mr.
Eliot suggests that everything men do, as
well as what they say when they are in
church, is part of their religion as well as
part of their culture in this anthropo-
logical sense:
There is an aspect in which we can see a
religion as the whole way of life of a
people, from birth to the grave, from
morning to night and even in sleep, and
that way of life is also its culture.
Though he expounds it lucidly, Mr.
Eliot himself unds this view of culture
and religion “so difficult that I am not
sure I grasp it myself except in flashes,
or that I comprehend all its implications.”
When, in one of his flashes, he does grasp
his idea, “which gives an importance to
our most trivial pursuits, to the occupa-
tion of our every minute,” he is afflicted
with “the honor of nightmare”;
To ask whether the people have not a
religion already, in which Derby Day and
the dog-track play their parts, is embar-
rassing; so is the suggestion that part of
the religion of the higher ecclesiastic is
gaiters and the Athenaeum.
Taking this vast, this total view of cul-
ture (a viewpoint from which parrots,
guinea-pigs or bulldog-ants would have to
be credited with existing in a state of
culture and religion), Mr. Eliot dis-
cusses the conditions required for
a healthy state of society; and
here, too, and especially to Dr.
C. E. M. load, he is likely to be con-
founding in his mild way. For Mr. Eliot
has little faith in “planners,” and when
Dr. load supports a suggestion that the
public schools should be taken over by
the State “to accommodate for two or
three years the intellectually abler
secondary schoolboys from the ages of
sixteen to eighteen,” asks how the doctor
proposes thereby to perpetuate that
special flavor of life which he had tasted
and praised at Winchester : “for the con-
ditions over which he pronounces such a
tearful valediction were not brought
about by equality of opportunity. They
were not brought about, either, by mere
privilege ; but by a happy combination
of opportunity and privilege, in the blend
he so savours, of which no Education
Act will ever find the secret.” Whatever
may be thought about the public schools
—and the present reviewer is inclined to
agree with Mr. Eliot —anything which
tends to the abolition of Dr. C. E. M.
load should undoubtedly be encouraged.
Looking at culture as a whole, Mr.
Eliot is, broadly, concerned with its
maintenance as a whole: his “three im-
portant conditions for culture” are;
First an organic (not merely a planned,
but growing) structure, such as will foster
the hereditary transmission of culture with-
in a culture; and this requires the per-
sistence of social classes.
The second is the necessity that a culture
should be analysable, geographically, into
local cultures : this raises the problem of
“regionalism.”
The third is the balance of unity and
diversity in religion that is, universality
of doctrine with particularity of cult and
devotion.
Some others of Mr. Eliot’s political
and social opinions, stated at intervals in
the essay, may be quoted here: he says
of India, “The only prospect of stability
in India seems the alternative of a de-
velopment, let us hope under peaceful
conditions, into a loose federation of
kingdoms, or to a mass uniformity attain-
able only at the price of the abolition of
class-distinctions and the abandonment ot
all religion—which would mean the dis-
appearance of Indian culture” ; and of
Russia, “Russia is a rude and vigorous
country; it is also a very big country ;
and it will need a long period of peace
and internal development. Three things
may happen. Russia may show us how a
stable government and a flourishing cul-
ture can be transmitted only through
elites; it may lapse into Oriental
lethargy; or the governing elite may fol-
low the course of other governing elites
and become a governing class.” In a
chapter on “Education and Culture” he
casts some scorn on the notion that, be-
cause education has not been sufficiently
widespread, the British Isles teem with
“mute inglorious Miltons” ; pointing out
at the same time that if these Miltons
have indeed been lost the nation may also
have escaped, in a legitimate variation of
the terms of Gray’s “Elegy,” an equal
number of Cromwells guilty of their
country’s blood.
To do justice to Notes Toward the
Definition of Culture, paying due regard
to the subtleties, refinements and qualifi-
cations of Eliot’s ideas and to debate
points of doubt or disagreement, one
would have to write an essay of equal or
even much greater length: Mr. Eliot, ad-
mitting the rather awkward fact that great
cultural developments have occurred in
the past after a religious faith had fallen
into decay, says that his own essay re-
quires expansion. As indeed it does: the
bald statement on page 110 that Dante is
“at least as great as Shakspeare” would
take a deal of proving.
"The Silver Branch."
Dulcie Deamer’s poems in The Silver
Branch (Swinburne Press, 229 Military-
road, Dover Heights, Sydney) lack the
direct, natural language of the best con-
temporary writing, but are not neces-
sarily the worse for that. They are sel-
dom directly concerned with Australia;
and, again, they are not necessarily the
worse for that.
“The Moreton Bay,” one of the few
poems located in Australia, will show
what the rest are made of: for, in the
second line, when the tree becomes a
“roc-bird,” the roots strike very quickly
through the light Australian soil —so to
speak—to the ancestral earth of the
world, the body of ancient mythology.
There is no stanza, no line, no meta-
phor in “The Moreton Bay” that cap-
tures in a flash the complete image of
that majestic tree, yet there are adjec-
tives and phrases—“bronze-gold, green-
black wing” ; “a noble, twilight body”—
which as a whole make a reasonably
satisfying description of trunk and
foliage, and there are other phrases—as
when the writer hears “a vast bell toll” —
which present the tree, again reasonably
effectively, as a symbol or incarnation of
some supernatural beauty.
Dulcie Deamer is not content to leave
the tree simply as a pleasing shape of
vegetation, or even as a symbol of mys-
terious power. She is not content to leave
herself simply as a writer. The tree be-
comes a “roc-bird” and the writer be-
comes something “ ’twixt tree-lemur and
Buddha,” and then both together go back
to the dawn of time where they “abode”
A direct and natural language is,
generally, desirable: for we are assured
thereby that the poet is making up his
own poems,' not borrowing his predeces-
sors’. Again, and for the same reason,
it is generally desirable that an Aus-
tralian tree should be an Australian tree
and not a roc-bird. And, again, because
an assemblage of mythological curiosities
is often a very different thing from a
revelation of genuine poetic vision,
sylphs, salamanders and undines and
gnomes are perilous company. Yet the
one essential question to be asked about
poetry of this kind is, does it work?
And, broadly, and in its total effect,
Dulcie Deamer’s poetry does work. When
you have finished “The Moreton Bay”
and “Heaven is spattered with heart-
blood, and roots become feet,” you feel
that you have kept company with not
only a Moreton Bay of our time but with
all trees of all time ; more, that you have
been taken beyond the earth and out of
time to that mystical “Heaven of trees”
where trees and men speak the same
language. Or, if the technical blemishes
and the facile romanticism inextricably
entangled with the genuine mysticism pre-
vent you from travelling in complete
sympathy with the poet, you are at least
certain that Dulcie Deamer has made the
journey. A poetry that concerns itself
less with the Australian and the con-
temporary than with the universal and
the timeless may be—as this poetry is in
flashes—not merely “permissible” but ad-«
mirable.
What is true of “The Moreton Bay” is
true of The Silver Branch as a whole.
rn r i, i , ~
There are faults by the dozen ; there are
“transparent hippognffs” of whic|i the
less said the better: and at any moment
Dulcie Deamer is likely to become, for
, L . , , , . ,
that moment, a poet and a visionary who
can “glare mile-long” with the light or
who has seeh: —
Not bread-giving, pigmy-grandfather God
But Slat which a the m iprm might cry to, in
ecstasy-agony, even as it was trod
Underfoot: unnamed, unbearable gorgon-
beauty, petrifying splendor of God.
On a less formidable plane of mysti-
cism and mythology the most attractive
poem in the book concerns a bishop’s
tomcat, who, greatly to the lady’s indig-
nation, made love to a witch who was
visiting the cleric’s pantry in the guise of
a she-cat. Technically and in narrative
interest, the poem loses force after its
delightful opening, and should, perhaps,
have ended at the point when the tomcat,
his disgraceful escapade over, .retires
virtuously for the remainder of the night
to the foot of his master’s bed.
The reviewer’s copy of The Silver
Branch has several pages misplaced.
Otherwise, it is an exceptionally pleas-
ing production, decorated with a frontis-
piece by Rosalie Norton (herself a
specialist in witches) and a very fine
cover-design by Norman Lindsay. The
edition is limited to 250 signed copies.
With sylphs, salamanders, and undines and
gnomes, and the Will
Of the World-Tree, whose crown is forests
of Heaven, all gold.
Beef, Beer, Grass and People .
Frank O’Loghlen’s' Beef Cattle in Aus-
tralia (F. H. Johnston, Sydney) contains
several simply-written articles by the
author and others, with some photo-
graphs and information about “Stud-
breeders and Studs,” making a combina-
tion of definition, advice and outline of
beef-cattle-raising which should be useful
to those interested. A study of the photo-
graphs would be useful to those city
people who go to a Royal Show not
sure how a Hereford differs from a Buff
Orpington.
It is natural, after this diet of meat,
to turn to Blades of Grass (Georgian
House), Professor H. C. Trumble’s con-
tribution to land literature. Dr. Trumble
is Professor of Agronomy at the famous
Waite Institute in S.A., and with this and
the spectacle of a double-page map of
the “Agro-climatic regions of South Aus-
tralia,” the reader might expect to settle
down to scientific dissertations on grass,
grimly determined to wade through a
book which seems at first glance to be
written for —er —agronomists, sheep-
herders and Frank O’Loghlen’s cattle-
punchers.
But Blades of Grass is an autobio-
graphy as well as a scientific treatise ; the
professor is quickly discovered to be a
son of that Hugh Trumble whose name
standeth evermore in the annals of our
cricket and whose farewell to the game
on M.C.G. in 1904 was three wickets
with his last three balls. But that was
as nothing to his selection for the Test
team 14 years earlier;
He opened the bowling for Victoria
before lunch [against N.S.W.] but, try as
he would, met with no success. In fact,
the performance was mediocre. It was a
hot day, and at lunch a friend endeavored
to revive his flagging spirits by suggesting
a glass of ice-cold Munich beer. My father
had never tasted beer before, but in his
depression and the conviction that his
chances had fled gloomily imbibed the
cooling draught and, liking it, partook of
more.
In short, he became drunk, went out,
skittled wickets in all directions and
literally drank himself into the Test side.
That occurs on page eight, and, of
course, the reader must bat on. There
follows a mixture of autobiography,
science, travel, adventure, humor and dis-
covery. For instance, the professor, sud-
denly surrounded by mounted Bedouins
“with an abundance of firearms,” on page
121, finds out that human hair really
stands on end in moments of fright. And
running through it all, as persistent and
impertinent as it is in all the life of the
earth, is the grass. Whether it’s for golf-
greens or cricket-pitches. New Zealand
dairy-herds or Australian sheep-farms,
Professor Trumble knows it from enzyme
to doses of molybdenum, and his text is
profusely illustrated.
With O’Loghlen’s beasts knee-deep in
Trumble’s grass, one turns to Ploughing
in Prejudices (Michael Joseph), by that
Edward Faulkner who startled the agri-
cultural world with Ploughman’s Foily
a couple of years or more ago. He is a
somewhat chastened Mr. Faulkner, not
so passionately eager to dump every
mouldboard plough in the world into the
sea on the premise that their continued
use means ultimate world starvation
through soil-destruction,
This second book is no volte face, but,
as the publisher says, it is “a mature re-
view of the whole position,” the author
having “travelled, discussed and thought
a great deal since his first book ap-
peared.” All to the good, evidently,
though sub-editing would have improved
the book. Passages such as
All of which is quite different from
giving blank approval, for the long view,
to conventional recommendations. Indeed,
a p o ]j 0 f opinion taken among agricultural
technicians engaged in activities that bring
them into regular association with farmers
an£ i their i aac i operations probably would
show that these men recognise an urgent
need for improvement in toil-management
methods
should be ploughed-in, or pruned, or
something before being thrust upon the
trusting agriculturist All the same
Faulkner has something to say worth
attention.
All three, books bear indirectly upon
Population Trends and Policies (Aus-
tralasian Publishing Co.), by W- D.
Borrie, M.A., a professor of Social His-
tory an d Social Economics at Sydney
University. His dose of statistics and
tables dealing with the decline in the size
G f the average family and the widespread
ignorance of its “true nature and sig-
nificance” is a timely reminder that there
m ay soon be no one left to eat Mr.
O’Loghlen’s beef.
Nobody concerned with the national
an d international aspects of his country’s
human fertility—and every thoughtful
Australian should be concerned about it
— ca n turn a deaf ear to Professor
Borrie. It is, perhaps, symptomatic of
the social as well as the agricultural times
that so many professors are being heard
from.
C.S.
Ballet Photographs .
Hugh P. Hall’s Ballet in Australia
(Georgian House), published at five
guineas, is a large, handsome book,
like a photograph album in shape
a nd bound in a navy-blue cloth with silver
lettering. Mr. Hall has an introduction ex-
plaining his aims and methods and dis-
cussing ballets he has seen and dancers
he has met, and he provides an enthusi-
astic commentary accompanying the
scores of photographs which make up the
bulk of the book.
The photographs, at first glance, are
disappointing. A few are beautiful, many
are rather dim and distant and the occa-
sional excursions into color-toning, though
they may make a dramatic effect, do not
a id clarity. But they are not, Mr. Hall
explains, “intended to be masterpieces of
photography.” Their special interest lies
i n the fact that they are records of the
ballet in action, taken during perform-
ances in Melbourne and, with the excep-
tion of the Monte Carlo co.’s season of
1934, covering every major ballet season
an d company (including the Borovan-
skys) from Pavlova in 1926 to the Ballet
Rambert.
Mr. Hall says that his photographs—the
book is a selection of 303 from thousands
he has taken, some of which he hopes to
prim in later volumes and some of which
have been exhibited at Melbourne’s Sedon
Galleries—have been of practical use to
the ballet companies at various times:
“Lichine found my photographs of value
to him for recalling positions and group-
ings in his ballet ‘Protee,’ all of which
he could not remember in detail” ; and
they should have a similar value for
Thp intact nf tbp hnok for the
students. Ihe interest ot tfte OOOK lor me

A few details concerning Tristan
da Cunha?
It is a small group of islands in
the Atlantic, half-way between the
Cape and South America. Besides
Tristan da Cunha and Gough’s
Island, there are Inaccessible and
Nightingale Islands. The four islands
are dependencies of St. Helena. The
habitable area of Tristan is about
12 square miles. Only about 30 acres
is under cultivation, three-quarters of
it for potatoes. Population in 1944
was 222. The original inhabitants
were shipwrecked sailors and soldiers
who remained behind when the gar-
rison from St. Helena was with-
drawn. At the end of April, 1942,
Tristan da Cunha was commissioned
as H.M.S. Atlantic Isle, and is now
an important meteorological and radio
station,

’ Who was Cagliostro, and what were
his most famous exploits?
He was an Italian impostor, posing
as an alchemist, whose dissolute life
and criminal ingenuity gained for him
notoriety all over Europe during the
latter half of the eighteenth century.
Implicated in the famous affair of the
diamond necklace in France, he
escaped conviction by the impudence
of his defence, but was imprisoned
for other reasons in the Bastille.
Venturing to Rome in 1789, he was
tried for freemasonry and sorcery and
condemned to death, but the sentence
was commuted. He died in 1795.

Under what tenures do settlers
within N.S.W. irrigation areas gener-
ally hold their land and what are
their water-rights ?
They generally hold their land under
freehold titles, tenures leading to
alienation, or under leases convertible
to alienable tenures. A residence
condition frequently applies under
Crown tenures, and a requirement of
improvements and satisfactory de-
velopment of the land is usual. The
principal tenures of irrigable lands
in irrigatibn areas carry water-rights
varying according to the type and
area of the holding,

When was California first settled
and how and when did it become an
American State?
First settled in 1769, it was from
its discovery down to 1846 politically
associated with Mexico. On July 7,
1846, the American flag was hoisted
at Monterey, and a proclamation was
issued declaring California to be a
portion of the United States, and on
February 2, 1848, by the Treaty of
Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the territory was
formally ceded by Mexico to the
United States, and was admitted to
the Union on September 9, 1850.

Dates of (1) the Reign of Terror
and (2) the Red Terror in French
history ?
(1) The Reign of Terror was that
period of the first French Revolution
from March (or according to another
view June), 1793, to July, 1794, when
the ruling faction ruthlessly executed
persons of both sexes and all ages
and conditions whom they regarded
as obnoxious. It was terminated by
the fall of Robespierre. (2) The Red
Terror is the term applied to the last
six weeks before July 27, 1794, when
1366 people were guillotined in Paris
alone.

How can I establish and maintain
a lawn of buffalo-grass from cuttings ?
Trench the ground and remove
weeds, etc.; then level with the back
of a rake or a board. Roots are the
best to use, and should be set in
rows about 6in. apart. As the run-
ners grow peg them down with hair-
?ins and keep them covered with soil,
lanting can be done up to end of
April in a warm position, but gener-
ally the roots are put in after August.
Until the lawn is established do not
use a heavy roller. Soil with a per-
centage of sand is most suitable.
Unless the land has a natural fall
drainage-pipes should be put in,

Who was Lollius, the author men-
tioned by Chaucer twice in “Troylus
and Cryseyde” and once in the
“House of Fame”?
He is unknown. The problem of
his identity is increased by the fact
that the first mention in “Troylus
and Cryseyde” relates to the love-
song of Troylus, which is a trans-
lation from Petrarch; the second
points, from its context, to Boccaccio.
In the “House of Fame” he is one
of six authors of the story of Troy,
the others being Homer, Dares, Tytus,
Guido da Colonna and Geoffrey of
Monmouth.

Can the use of chemicals be recom-
mended to encourage the burning of
stumps?
Despite the rather frequent expression
of views to the contrary, neither salt-
petre nor any other chemical is of any
value in assisting the burning of,
stumps. The best way to deal with
a stump that bums badly is to build
a good pile of logs and brush around
it, fire in the ordinary way, and cover
the burning material, when well alight,
with clay. Such fire will smoulder
for some weeks and will gradually
destroy the stump.

When were the first intercolonial
(or inter-State) and club premierships
played by the Australian Rules and
Rugby Union?
The first intercolonial ’Rules games
were Victoria v. South Australia in
1879, and Vic. and Westralia in
1904; the first Vic. Football Asso-
ciation premiership was won by Mel-
bourne in 1870. The opening Rugby
Union inter-State matches were Q.
v. N.S.W. in 1882, N.S.W. v. N.Z.
in 1888, and N.S.W. v. Vic, in 1904;
Waratah won the first premiership
under the N.S.W. club system w
1874.

Bunthorne in Gilbert and Sullivan s
“Patience” describes himself as
A pallid and thin young man,
A haggard and lank young man,
A greenery-yallery, Orosvenor Gallery,
Foot-in-the-grave young man.
Why the reference to the Grosvenor
Gallery ?
It was in Bond-street, London,
erected by Sir Coutts Lindsay in
1876, and was for the exhibition of
pictures of the modern school. It was
especially associated for a time with
the aesthetic movement in which the
adoption of sentimental archaism as
the ideal of beauty was carried to
extravagant lengths and accompanied
by affectation of speech and eccen-
tricity of dress. It was much ridiculed
during the ’eighties of the last century.

A young boxer has an opportunity
to join a troupe of travelling boxers.
Would this be advisable from the
point of view of his career?
Many great boxers, among them
Jem Driscoll and Jimmy Wilde, began
their careers with touring troupes.
Boxing against country heavyweights
in tents, however, must harm any
young boxer who is a middleweight
or lighter. There are many other
avenues open that would be more
beneficial than travelling with a tent-
show. Most champions began their
careers in tournaments (amateur or
professional), and they are still the
best nursery for young boxers.

A WINDY NIGHT OUT.
(On route from Colac to Camperdown.)
The gusty winds, the gusty winds
From the south did fiercely blow
To the difecomfort of the horse’s
But the weather willed it so.
The gusty winds, the gusty winds
Were out to do and dare
Like a cradle rocked the waggon
As they whistled thro the air
The gusty winds,, the gusty winds
Deprived us of our sleep.
Calm weather on the morrow,
We hailed with great relief.
THE COMMISSIONER
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
50MEWHERE about 40
years ago the “white-man”
ruler of the Solomon
Islands, so far as concerned
Great Britain and the rest of the
world was a very big man in-
deed. hi® latd es
SS’ C Am°ni "te Head
Hunters, Resident Commissioner
of the Solomons, whose only re-
sponsibility, under God, was to
the High Commissioner for the
Western Pacific in Fiji. And he
ran the Solomon Islands Protec-
torate, according to the writer’s
notion, about as well as it could
be run.
But it was to moral rather than
to physical force that the good
results obtained in the Solomons
were due. The word “Protecto-
rate” would seem to have been
applied in an utterly literal
sense, and the function of gov-
eminent to have been under-
stood in the light of the real
meaning of the word.
The native was made, firmly
and unmistakably, to understand
the meaning of the various pro-
hibitions which affected his exist-
ence. If he went headhunting
the punishment meted out to
him was generally swift, stern
and certain. In consequence,
headhunting at that time was
rapidly becoming a lost art. If a
native should indulge in the joy
of missionary murder, he suf-
fered in life and property ; so
missionary murder had lost
much
If he slew his fellow-native, and
was detected, he was called upon
to pay a penalty. If he “cut out”
a trader’s schooner or cutter,
killed its owner and crew, and
then looted the vessel, awful
things came his way. If he im-
ported firearms, or was found in
possession of them, he was made
a prisoner, and rewarded with a
term of hard labor in the Gov-
ernment plantations, or on other
works.
But Heaven help the trader
who maltreated the natives, either
by using them unjustly, by taking
their property, or wantonly
shooting them! If his offence
was sheeted home, his punish-
ment was severe and unpleasant,
and well calculated to prevent
other traders from doing like-
wise. So far as this latter state-
ment is concerned, I once wit-
nessed an incident which im-
pressed me deeply. *
Lying at anchor in a harbor
of the Shortlands one hot after-
noon, several of the officers and
passengers of the trading-
steamer which periodically
visited the group were amusing
themselves by firing with a
small-bore Winchester rifle at
floating bottles and other targets
dropped from the ship. The
chief engineer—he’s dead now —
had the rifle in his hand, and
about 300 yards away a solitary
native was paddling in a canoe
across the glass-like bay.
“See me scare that fellow!”
said the chief.
Just to show what he could
do, he put the rifle to his
shoulder and aimed at the water
50 yards in front of the
approaching canoe. The bullet
splashed, and then, having rico-
cheted, made another splash
about another hundred yards
further on. It must have
buzzed just above the btlack-
man’s head. It didn’t seem to
scare him, for he continued his
course towards the steamer.
Unfortunately for the chief en-
gineer, however, the Commis-
sioner, Charles Woodford, who
was also a passenger, happened
to be walking up the deck be-
hind,him as he indulged in this
most egregious piece of folly.
For about ten minutes that en-
gineer had about as bad a time
as it was possible for any good-
but-silly chap to have.
The Commissioner gave him
what has been called Holy Hades
—otherwise Hell —and informed
him that his foolishness might
quite’•easily be the cause of an-
other white man losing his life.
Then he told him he had a pretty
good mind to give him —as he
could do —three months in jail,
and immediately ordered the
captain to send him to his cabin
whilst he, Charles Woodford,
thought the matter over. It was
a very frightened and unhappy
chief engineer who descended
precipitately to his apartment
in the port alleyway.
It always seemed to me that
that sort of thing was what made
Woodford such a great man. He
always seemed to be trying to
bring it home to the native that
the white man was there to try
to give him justice, both in pun-
ishment and protection, and that
anyone who wronged him would
“get it in the neck.”
The black gentleman, for his
part, knew that, both in punish-
ment and protection, he could
rely on the Commissioner to do
his best and fairest —but he also
knew that if he transgressed the
Commissioner’s laws life would
be hardly worth living. He re-
spected the strong hand, but
wasn’t slow in recognising that
the strong hand was capable of
holding the scales of justice level.
He knew a good man when he
saw him —as one dares to say he
does now.


A NUMBER IN EVERY SQUARE
By
J.B. BLAIR
PREFERENTIAL voting is a hell of
a subject to be discussing at a
Christmas reunion, except that, I
suppose, any subject is fair game
when old tent-mates get together again.
I don’t know how it came up. Most of
these discussions start nowhere and end
in the same place. Anyway, somewhere
in between the beers Spoggie Barnes
bought into the argument.
“Preferential voting might be all very
well for some places,” he announced,
“but it didn’t work out right in Goola-
gong ”
“Don’t spoil the party by bringing
Goolagong into it,” pleaded Jazzer
Jones. “I’ve been enjoying myself up to
now.”
“Preferential voting will work out
anywhere,” dogmatised Jacko Palmer.
It’s a scientifically-devised system that
ensures that the most favored candidate
is elected.”
“Not in Goolagong,” said Spoggie.
“Anywhere.”
“Not in Goolagong.”
“Never mind about Goolagong. It’s
the same everywhere. Can’t fail.”
“ I T failed in Goolagong.”
1 “They couldn’t have worked it
right. Didn’t understand it properly, I
suppose.”
“That was just the trouble. They
understood it too well. At least, Ritho
Thompson did.”
“I tell you, the system can’t fail,”
Palmer began, but Jazzer Jones cut him
short.
“Don’t argue, Jacko, Let the Spog
get on with his yarn. Once he starts on
Goolagong there’s no peace till he gets
it off his chest,”
“He can tell his yarn if he likes,” con-
ceded Jacko generously, “but he won’t
convince me.”
“It’s not my yarn, really,” said
Spoggie. “It’s the old man’s. But I’ve
heard it so often I know it off by heart.
It happened years ago when preferential
voting first came in. There were four
candidates putting up for Goolagong that
year, though only three of ’em had any
chance—only two, really.”
Palmer nodded. “That’s where
preferential voting comes irt,” he said.
“Under first-past-the-post the people
who voted for the last two would be just
throwing their votes away. Preferential
voting gave them a second choice.”
“Yes, that’s the theory,” agreed
Spoggie patiently.
“Not only theory. It works out in
practice.”
“Not in Goolagong.”
“Goolagong my foot! It’d have to
work there the same as anywhere else.”
Spoggie Barnes considered a moment.
li \\l ELL, perhaps it might have,” he
“ * said at length, “if it hadn’t been
for Ritho Thompson. As I said, there
were four candidates Hardy, the
Liberal bloke; he was a solicitor in
Goolagong and the sitting member. Then
there was Cooper. He had a farm a few
miles out of the town and was running
for the Country party. He’d had a crack
at the seat before and had given Hardy
a pretty good go, but there was no Labor
bloke standing that time, and that helped
him a lot. This time Labor was putting
up a man—O’Grady, a wild Irishman
who didn’t expect to win, but was in it
for the fun of the fight. Another one
that was running for fun was old Joe
Venner. Independent Was his label, and
it described him pretty well. He had
some pet currency scheme like Social
Credit in his nut and nominated for the
chance of doing a bit of spouting,”
“Where did this bloke Thompson come
in?” asked Jazzer.
“Ritho? Well, he’s the whole story.
He ran an agency business in Goolagong.
A bit of a mathematical genius. When
he was at school he used to have his
answers ready almost before the teacher
finished writing the questions on the
board. The kids nicknamed him Ritho
—short for arithmetic —and it stuck,”
“School nicknames do,” commented
Jazzer. “I’ve had mine since I was ten.
It got fastened on to me quite casually,
too. I was playing marbles one day with
some other kids and a bloke conjes up
and”
“Who’s telling this story?”
“All right, go on.”
“Well, Ritho got himself appointed
campaign secretary to Hardy, the Liberal
bloke. Hardy only meant him to arrange
his meetings, get out dodgers and so on,
but Ritho had a few ideas of his own.
He was years ahead of his time and had
devised a kind of Gallup-poll system of
his own. He trotted out figures that
gave his man something to think about.
According to Ritho, Hardy would be
in front all right on the first count, but
his following had slipped a bit since the
last elections. The rest of the committee
wouldn’t believe it at first, but Ritho
convinced them his poll system was
watertight and his figures reliable. They
still weren’t worried much. They
reckoned it didn’t matter much if
dropped a few hundred votes; he’d stiU
get in on second preferences.
‘Oh, no, he won’t,’ Ritho told them.
‘O’Grady’s second preferences’ll put
Cooper in.’
T HEY all got arguing, then. This was
their first experience of preferential
voting, don’t forget, and they didn’t
really understand it properly. Ritho did K
Most of ’em had the idea that as Hardy
was going to top the poll and most of
the Country-party people voting for
Cooper would put Hardy number-two
he couldn’t possibly miss. Ritho pointed
out that Cooper’s second prefs. would
only come into the picture if he was
third or fourth on the first count. Ritho’s
Gallup poll showed he’d be second, so his
preferences wouldn’t be distributed at all.
He calculated old Joe Venner’s prefer-
ences would be just about evenly dis-
tributed and wouldn’t affect the issue.
O’Grady’s supporters—he was Labor you
remember —would nearly all .go to
Cooper, putting him ahead of Hardy.
It took Ritho a long time to get this
into the skulls of the committee, but they
understood at last. Then they got him
to explain his poll system all over again.
Finally they all admitted that it looked
as if Hardy was a goner unless they got
busy. They were full of suggestions for
whipping up extra votes for their man,
but Ritho set them back on their heels by
saying that line of attack would be no
good. Hardy asked him why.
‘Well,’ Ritho told him. ‘Suppose we
do that. Suppose we pull in a few hun-
dred extra votes. It’s too much to ex-
pect that we could get an absolute
majority, and unless we made sure that
all the new votes came from Cooper’s
supporters and not from Laborites the
position would remain the same.’
THEY looked pretty glum on hearing
that, so Ritho let ’em chew on it for
a while before he went any further. Then
he said:
‘There is a way out of it if we like to
take it.’ -
Of course they were all eager to hear it,
so Ritho went on.
‘Well, take the figures I’ve given you
for the first count:
Hardy ....... 2000
Cooper 1500
O’Grady ..... 1200
Venner ~...... 300
You can see that after Venner’s second
preferences are distributed, as long as
O’Grady’s prefs. go solidly to Cooper—
and I think you’ll agree they’re bound to
—we’re licked. Our only chance is to
see that Cooper is in third place and not
second in the primary count. O’Grady’s
second preferences won’t matter a hang
then. Cooper’s will be the ones to be
distributed, and they’ll mostly come to
us.’
The committee brightened up a little
bit at that. They still didn’t know what
he was getting at, but the suggestion that
there was still some hope for Hardy
cheered them up. Hardy wasn’t con-
vinced, though. He wanted to know how
Ri|ho intended to push Cooper down the
list if he wouldn’t admit there was any
likelihood of taking many votes away
from him.
‘We can’t take any from Cooper,’ said
Ritho, ‘but there’s nothing to stop us
giving some to O’Grady.’
‘Some of Cooper’s?’ asked Hardy.
‘Some of yours.’
‘Like hell,’ exploded Hardy. ‘You
leave my votes alone. Your job’s to get
me votes, not to give ’em away,’
‘My job’s to get you elected,’ Ritho
told him.
‘And how the hell do you figure you
can do that by giving half my votes to
O’Grady? If I’m to give any away I’d
rather give ’em to Cooper.’
‘And put him in?’
‘l’d rather put him in than O’Grady.’
Ritho kept as patient as he couM
when they all turned on him and asked
whether he was working for Hardy or
O’Grady. . *
‘l’m trying to tell you how to get
Hardy elected,’ he told them.
‘By giving my votes to O’Grady?’
yelled Hardy. ‘How the hell can that
get me elected?’
“That’s what I’d like to know,” said
Jacko Palmer. “Y’ can’t start mucking
about with preferences. That’s one of
the merits of the system. It’s cheat-
proof.”
“Don’t interrupt,” said Jazzer, passing
up the beer mugs for a refill. “Let
Spoggie get on with the story,”
CTPOGGIE had ignored the interrup-
tion, anyway. “Ritho told ’em to
look at the figures again,” he went on.
‘Suppose four hundred of our people
instead of voting Hardy one. Cooper
two, O’Grady three, Vernier four do as
I suggest and vote O’Grady one. Hardy
two. Cooper three, Venner four, that’ll
make the first-count figures:
O’Grady ..... 1600
Hardy 1600
Cooper ...... 1500
Venner 300
Venner’s preferences’ll just about break
even, then Cooper’s prefs.’ll put us in.’
‘Say it again,’ Hardy asked him.
Ritho repeated it twice more before
they all got the idea. There were still
objections, though: they came from two
sorts of critics. First, there were those
who didn’t like the plan because it wasn’t
sporting—Hardy was one of them. He
argued it was playing a dirty trick on the
Country-party man. Cooper.
‘After all, he’s really on the same side

VARIOUS VERSE
Who Praised the Mountain.
Who praised the mountain, praised his
own lost self,
Something he had thought to be, long
ago and nearly forgotten.
Standing in the garden’s rotten
Floor of fallen peach and scattered
flower spray.
The ooze of walnuts and the roses spent
Pale on the wormy apples beside the
pear
Too old to bear.
Who praised the mountain, saying
Climb if tomorrow, on the crest
The grass is yellow like long yellow hair
Climb me the mountain ...
In the evening garden something moved
no more than a heart’s beat,
A mouse, a moth, a batwing, a • twitch of
fur,
A leaf spinning between earth and tree,
A spider in the white web’s secret door,
A tear of sap on the long Uchened
branch.
The essence of a stir
In the dark earth tunnelled with ancient
roots
Under his feet ...
Who praised the mountain, saying
On the far side lie fields of corn and
open fields
And miles and miles of orchards in
strait rows.
Climb me the mountain ... and leaned
his head upon a stone
That seemed Jo crumble. So we left him
there.

"In the face the story lies;
The soul cannot its secrets seal —
It may be seen behind the eyes.
And age ? Age the two hands reveal
"Oh I looked at my hands today
(As for my face I know it well) ;
It seemed my first youth’s slipped away ;
(As for my eyes I cannot tell)."
And yet I know my fingers ten
Better by sight than eyes or face.
And, as for that, I do know when
My birth was, better than I can trace
The detailed history of this living ,*
My days in sequence, so many hours
Gone and forgotten, getting and giving,
Striving and laughing—dead as the
flowers
That bloomed a hundred years ago.
Lost just as far as yesterday;
Vanished—neither quick nor slow.
Only these hands are here to stay.
These things of sinew, flesh and bone
Holding my pen, these parts of me;
Expressing nothing of their own.
They mirror exactest intimacy.
“Then I need never for my life’s range
Look at my features in a glass.
My face could be to me as strange
As those of all the people I pass.”
"Oh you can never do a task
Or hold a leaf, or write a page
But those two witnesses shall ask
The truth, or tell it, of your age.”

BITS AND PIECES.
We travel like some disarmed, blind-
folded captive,
Who moves, by stern compulsion, stum-
_ blingly,
Seeing but glimpses of the earth he treads
on,
Whither, he knows not.
Frayed purposes we know, spasmodic
promptings.
Dreams unfulfilled, dead loves, short-
range ambitions.
Faint gleams and uphill progress, hard-
won inches.
Wrestlings in darkness ;
We know full-blooded hates, blind fears,
rebellions,
Frustrated lusts, desires beyond achieve-
ment,
Fevers and agonies of mind and body,
Shafts launched at random.
Now, as that misery sets himself to judg-
ing
From barely-spied weeds springing by the
wayside,
From scents of whin or heath, from hill-
birds calling,-
Whither they urge him.
So we, snatching but scraps of disrupt
knowledge,
Wildly construing from our bits and
pieces,
Striving for clues to the whole mystic
pattern,
Guess our hereafter.
Those iron hands which cruelly push us
forward,
What wills inspire, what depth of know-
ledge guides them ?
Are they like us, puppies purblindly
groping,
Humble but hopeful?

Fitted with a | cubic yard Traxcavator
Shovel, a Caferpillar D 4 Diesel Tractor
speeds the. loading of salt af stock
piles.
"Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and Earth-Moving Equipment shifted 1,500,000 cubic yards of
tidal swamp and reared up 25 miles of retaining walls to form Dry Creek’s acres of salt-
concentrating ponds, And the harvesting of hundreds of thousands of tons of salt also calls
for the dependability, economy and tireless power of "Caterpillar,”
ė
ę
Salt for the tables o£ Australia’s homes, alkali products soda ash,
caustic soda, bicarbonate of soda and calcium chloride for a host of
Australian industries are being won by the evaporation of sea water at
the Dry Creek Solar Salt Fields of 1.C.1. Alkali (Aust.) Pty. Ltd.
At this vast project, so vital to essential industry, the whole of the con-
structional and maintenance work is carried out by "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors and Earth-Moving Equipment. And at harvesting time, when
complete evaporation has left a deposit of salt 4 to 5 inches thick over
acres of "ponds,” "Caterpillar” lifts the year’s yield. Machines mounted
on "Caterpillar” Diesel D 4 Tractors deliver the garnered salt to portable
conveyor belts mounted on "Caterpillar”
tracks and powered by "Caterpillar” Diesel
power. During the 6 to 8 weeks before the
rains, this "Caterpillar”-powered plant, with
two harvesting machines operating, handles
an average of 350 tons of salt every work-
ing hour.
Whatever the job, however gruelling the
conditions and demands, two basic facts
underline the wide user-preference for
"Caterpillar”; they arc, thorough—going
quality of manufacture and the efficient
service rendered by "Caterpillar” dealers.

WEST DIFFERENCES.
Analysing reports from its
representatives in Berlin, Paris,
London, Washington and else-
where, “U.S. News and World
Report” finds that even billions
of dollars “can’t seem to settle
arguments among friends,” that
“disagreements, some of them
deep, keep coming to the sur-
face,” damaging Western unity.
In the Berlin dispute the
West’s “Big Three” are seen as
putting up a front united in
principle but tending to crack in
practice —enough of a difference
for the Russians to exploit. The
U.S. stand is that it might be
wiser to put off bargaining until
the West is stronger—through
the Recovery Programme, North
Atlantic Alliance and rearma-
ment. The French position is
that the West is almost as re-
sponsible as Russia for the
Berlin crisis:
“The French warned the U.S.
and Britain that building up
Western Germany would force
the Russians to retaliate, as they
have in Berlin.... .So the French
lean toward conciliatory tactics.
Real difference between U.S. and
French positions comes down to
this: The French would rather
settle the Berlin crisis now, even
if it involves conceding some-
what to the Russians ; the U.S.
wants to wait the Russians out.”
The difference in that regard
“is not enough to split the
Western Allies wide open, but it
is enough to reduce the West’s
bargaining power, to give Russia
another wedge to hammer.” The
Ruhr dispute, however, is a
fundamental one: “It’s a far-
reaching argument between the
U.S. and France, with Britain in
the middle, on how to prevent
World War 111. Policy on Ger-
many, not just the Ruhr, is at
issue. It’s one thing France is
united on.” This issue was by
no means finally disposed of by
the six-Power agreement in Lon-
don on Ruhr control. It was
merely postponed.
The French argument runs
on these lines: A weak Germany
is necessary if Europe is to have
lasting peace. A strong Ger-
many, capable of invading
France for a fourth time, can
grow all too easily out of a
unified, centralised Western Ger-
many, a rebuilt Ruhr. Russia
is not the enemy, after all.
Germany is the one to watch.
The solution, therefore, is to
keep ownership and control of ,
Ruhr industries, which are essen-
tial to a strong Germany, out
of German hands, under inter-
national control indefinitely.”
Thus argue the French. The
U.S., “more worried about
Russia than about Germany,”
sees it this way; “European re-
covery can’t wait for a peace
settlement to make final deci-
sions on Ruhr industries. All of
Europe needs Ruhr coal and
steel now. A temporary
arrangement, permitting the
Ruhr to produce, yet postponing
decisions on ownership of in-
dustries, is therefore indispens-
able, and need not be dangerous.
U.S. taxpayers, furthermore,
want to be relieved of subsidis-
ing the Ruhr. The question of
security and threat of German
resurgence, in any case, can’t
arise while the Allies occupy
Germany, and can be taken care
of in the peace settlement.”
Inside France, General de
Gaulle is bent on capitalising on
that big U.S.-French difference,
and “U.S. officials watch his
campaign with considerable
anxiety ” For other reasons,
they fear De Gaulle’s coming
into power: the Marshall Plan
would run up against his insis-
tence on using such aid “without
interference or guidance from
the U.S.”; also, U.S. ideas on
trade would clash with his belief
in high- tariffs ; and, again, “de-
fence of Western Europe, if De
Gaulle had his way, would appa-
rently revolve around the French
Army.”
Other differences noted: “A
United States of Europe, talked
of by the French, gets a cool
reception from the British. The
Italian colonies remain a com-
plicating factor among the
Western Allies. Palestine con-
tinues to test U.S.-British rela-
tions.”
Controlled Ruhr.
As indicated by the French
and U.S. positions set forth in
the foregoing article, the six-
Power agreement on the Ruhr
reached at the close of the year
represented something of a con-
cession to French insistence.
By that agreement, the Inter-
national Ruhr Authority, which
Britain and the U.S. —the U.S.
especially —had intended should
have powers limited to control
of distribution, not production,
will now have much tighter
powers.
The idea in control of distri-
bution was that the Authority
would determine the amount of
Chicago “Tribune:”
THE CADDIE: “And in the end he always blames me."
coal, coke and steel to be ex-
ported as against the amount to
be consumed in Germany, the
theory being that such control
of the amounts allowed for
domestic consumption would
make rearmament virtually im-
possible, especially as there
would alS|o be periodic inspec-
tions of the German industries
themselves.
A potent factor in the U.S.-
British viewpoint all along has
been the importance of German
production in the European Re-
covery Programme—production
considered quite unlikely to be
forthcoming without incentive
on a national scale. Hence, it
the effect of the latest arrange-
ment should be to retard the
progress brought about by in-
centives of one sort and another
in Western Germany, it could
be disastrous, and a principal
sufferer would be France.
Before the new agreement
was reached an American
correspondent had commented
on the six-Power discussion of
it; “The Americans at least
have consistently opposed inter-
national ownership or manage-
ment of the Ruhr’s industries.
The administrative problems in
such an arrangement would
alone have intimidated the
hardiest bureaucrat. The effect
on the morale of workers and
management in the Ruhr would
have been catastrophic.”
On those grounds the re-
actions over the months ahead in
Western Germany generally and
the Ruhr particularly will be
anxiously watched, nowhere
more than in Washington, where
Congress would certainly not
agree to the U.S, filling any gap
caused by a failure of Western
German production to come up
to the estimates on which
E.R.P. has been broadly based.
Churchill on Germany.
No one could question the
“right” to speak on Germany
claimed by Mr. Churchill in the
House of Commons, urging that
nothing should be done by the
British Government “or, so far
as we could deter, by our allies”
to chill or check the “important
evolution of German sentiment”
evidenced by the 1948 recovery
in Western Germany.
He congratulated the Govern-
ment “on the success surpassing
expectations of the prodigious
air-lift to feed the people of
Berlin,” and further said:
“The issues which the achieve-
ment has raised are far more
important than the technical suc-
cess. Magnificent as it has been,
it has taught the peoples of Ger-
many, on either side of the iron
curtain, in a way which no
speeches or arguments or
promises could do, that their
future lay in ever closer associa-
tion with the Western world.
The recent elections in Berlin
were a proof of the resurrection
of the German spirit, and they
were a beacon casting its light
upon the minds of a mighty

race, without whose effective
aid the glory of Europe could
not be revived.”
He said he looked forward to
the day when “all the hateful
processes of denazification trials
and even the trials of leaders or
prominent servants of the Hitler
regime” might be brought to an
end. Surely enough blood had
been shed; he would not take
another life because of the
quarrels, horrors and atrocities
of the past. He trusted also that
the demolition or destruction of
German factories and plant, ex-
cept those which were directly
or exclusively concerned with
war-making power—because we
must not part from our resolve
to carry out the disarmament of
Germany not only in the mili-
tary but in the munitions sphere
—might be brought to an end
at the earliest possible moment.
“We should continue to use
our influence and resources to
make the German people, or the
States and Principalities of Ger-
many, able to govern themselves
and earn a good livelihood as
soon as possible.” He hoped
that the States of Germany
might regain much of their in-
dividuality and rights. It was
along that road that both France
and Britain would find it easiest
to advance ; and it was along
that road that reconciliation
and healing would in the first
instance be most easily found
across the former lines of battle.
That individuality should be re-
stored and revived before any
degree of structural unity could
be restored.
In all those processes of re-
conciliation with Germany, he
added, lay the opportunity of
France to regain her place in the
leadership of Europe. “It is time
the 1000-year quarrel which had
ruined Europe and almost de-
stroyed world civilisation should
be ended. The accounts can
never be squared. Vengeance is
the most costly and dissipating
of luxuries ; retributive justice,
evep on so vast a scale, is be-
yond the sphere and competence
of human action. Let France
take the lead in bringing the
German people back to. the
European family. We have a
right—and I have a right—to
offer that sincere counsel to the
French people, at whose side for
more than 40 years the British
nation has struggled and suf-
fered.”
Headaches for Uncle.
As summarised by “U.S.
News and World Report,” it
looks like a very rough time
ahead for Uncle Sam in his
global role:
“China is falling apart; U.S.
policy towards China is at the
crisis stage.
“Berlin is deep in the struggle
between bad weather and Rus-
sians on one hand and the
West’s air-lift on the other. Like
Berlin, U.S. is on the spot.
“Western Germany, though
recovering, is sprouting fresh
troubles for the U.S.
“France turns out to he a
difficult ally; promises to be
more difficult later.
“Greece is proving that the
Truman doctrine can win
battles against Communists, but
offers no sign that U.S. is win-
ning the war against the idea of
Communism.
“Palestine doesn’t calm down
the way the U.S. wants, but in-
stead keeps the U.S. in hot
water.
“Japan and Korea, expensive
trouble spots, are to be more
troublesome, more expensive as
Communists win and U.S. loses
prestige and foothold in China.
“Wherever you look,” the
authoritative journal concludes,
“U.S. foreign policy is going
through severe tests, being sub-
jected to extraordinary pres-
sures. It’s hardly a time for
complacency.”
Without U.N.O.
Kind words for U.N.O. ex-
pressed by some of the faithful
have already been given an
“Uncabled Additions” airing.
Here’s what N. Y. “Sunday
News” thinks about it:
“If something had prevented
the birth of the U.N. what
would have happened? It
seems to us that the common
man wouldn’t have sunk into a
dream of no more war or
chance of war. He’d have kept
his realisation, reborn when
Hitler attacked Poland in
September, 1939, that this is a
chancy world and you shouldn’t
trust any nation blindly.
“This state of the common
man’s mind would have kept
the United States and Great
Britain from rushing to demobi-
lise and disarm at breakneck
speed after the Japanese sur-
render, We’d have kept more
soldiers in uniform until we
saw how Russia was going to
behave; and more airplanes
tuned up, more fighting ships
out of mothballs, and so on.
“That in turn would have
kept the Kremlin, at least for a
while, from sallying forth on
what now is seen to be an
attempt to conquer the entire
world for Communism sooner
or later. There would have
been considerably less Russian
grabbing than there has been in
the Balkans, Manchuria, Korea
and other areas.
“Russia’s fifth-columns
around the world would not be
so brassy and confident as they

Communists in France might
not be able to cripple that tragic
country, Czechoslovakia might
have been saved from the clutch
of Communism ; Yugoslavia by
this time might have been liber-
ated from Red Tito through an
upsurge of the peasants.
“If there had been no U.N.,
it seems more than likely that
the United States would be in
better shape today than it is. We
would have adequate air, land
and sea forces in being. Hence,
we would not now be scram-
bling to rearm, at a cost esti-
mated at anywhere from 15 to 30
billions a year for some time to
come. Nor would we be getting
frantic requests from Western
Europe for arms against Russia
if Western Europe had remained
adequately armed after the war.
“Our main regret is that what
might have happened did not
happen; that, on the contrary,
the U.N. played a tremendous
part in bringing on the scanda-
lous and dynamite-loaded snafu
in which the world finds itself
today.”
Rust-proof Cars.
In the British style, without
any fuss or feathers, London
“Times” has reported “a de-
velopment in the production of
rustless motor - car bodies,”
which, the “Times” notes almost
as an afterthought, “has not yet
been achieved in any other
country.”
The brief report added that
the process is now being applied
to the Standard Vanguard bodies
made by the Castle Bromwich
factory of Fisher and Ludlow,
Ltd. The complete chassis, frame
and body, is made rust-proof
and painted with primer in a
“Rotodip” plant 300 ft. long and
capable of treating 18 bodies an
hour, the treatment taking Ihr.
47min.
In the process the bodies are
impaled on a “spit” on which
they revolve as they pass through
the six tanks of the cleaning and
phosphating section, after which
they are dried, painted with
primer and baked.
The company’s 45-acre fac-
tory at Castle Bromwich is now
the largest press plant in Europe,
Malaya Facts.
Though specifically . replying
to Communist propaganda about
Malaya, Sir Shenton Thomas,
former Straits Settlement Gov-
ernor and High Commissioner
for the Malay States, has pro-
vided in a London “Times” let-
ter an answer to Mr. Chifley’s
“profit” sneer, as well as giving
other interesting information. A
few extracts:
“We [British] introduced the
rubber-tree [to Malaya] in 1880,
and today there are more than
3,250,000 acres under the crop,
half of which are owned by
Asiatics, chiefly small-holders
farming 100 acres or less. These
latter exported just on 230,000
tons in 1946.
“Of the tm industry, one-third
is in the hands Asiatics, so
are 450,000 of the 600,000 acres
which produce the copra ex-
ports, so are the 750,000 acres
under rice, and a host of minor
industries such as sago and topi-
oca, spices, fishing, the growing
of tobacco and the manufacture
of cigarettes and cheroots. It
follows that the bulk of the
wealth is in Asiatic hands.

of every three children of school
age were receiving education in

secondary, trade, or technical
schools, or at Raffles College.
There were 232 Government
hospitals with over 1,750,000
attendances a year. By anti-
malaria control, the provision of
pipe-borne water supplies, by
propaganda and ceaseless super-
vision, the public health was
good, and Malaya was probably
the healthiest colony in the
tropics. The King Edward VII
College of Medicine in Singa-
pore provides diplomas in medi-
cine and dentistry.
“There is no ‘closed shop’ in
Malaya. On the trains and in
the street-cars, in the theatres
and amusement parks, at race-
meetings and in games such as
football, lawn-tennis and cricket,
people of all races mix freely
and there is no racial discrimina-
tion. In the tennis and athletic
championships Asiatics are vic-
tors as often as not.
“When war came Malaya was
free only for two and a half
years. In that short time the
people gave £17,000,000 to the
British Government for Imperial
defence ; the rest of the colonial
empire in the full six years of
war gave £7,000,000, They gave
£575,000 to a bomber fund
raised by one of the local news-
papers and £385,000 to the
British Red Cross, the Lord
Mayor’s Air Raid Distress Fund
and other war-relief organisa-
tions. They co-operated in build-
ing up a six-month reserve of
food and medical supplies; up-
wards of 40,000 men joined up,
most of them in the Civil De-
fence Force, others in the volun-
teers and the Malay Regiment.
“Since our return they have
shown themselves as loyal as
ever to the British connection,
always excepting the Com-
munists, and of these practically
none is Malaya-born. Nearly
all are China-born immigrants,
with no stake in Malaya and no
interest in life except murder
and rapine.”
Their E.R.P. Whack.
The official figures for what’s
going to each of the countries
participating in the European
Recovery Programme should, as
a “Wall-street Journal” writer
puts it, “dispose of the emotion-
provoking statement, often made
loosely and irresponsibly, that
Germany is being built up ‘ahead
of its victims’,”
Of the Congress-appropriated
$4.8 billion for 1948-49 (“bil-
lion” in the American usage, of
course), the two principal bene-
ficiaries are Britain and France,
the former receiving $1.3 billion,
the latter $989 million. How-
ever, on net balance France gets
more assistance than Britain.
For Great Britain is to pass on
some $2BO million to needier
countries, besides unfreezing
$2OO million in sterling balances
for the benefit of E.R.P. asso-
ciates.
On the other hand, the writer
states, France proceeds on the
basis that it is more blessed to
receive than to give. It is
assigned a supplementary $323
million in inter-member aid, and
this adds up to a grand total of
$1.3 billion in outside help to
bolster the French economy. The
Netherlands is also a double
beneficiary, with $496 million
from E.R.P. funds. Net aid to
Italy is $5Bl million, to Western
Germany $505 million, to
Austria $2Bl million and to
Greece $224 million.
Belgium is allotted $250 mil-
lion under E.R.P.; but makes
the largest contribution, next to
Britain, to the general pool of
inter-Allied aid, $203 million.
This reflects the flourishing state
of Belgian production and trade.
Belgium has built up credit
balances, while some other
countries have been accumulat-
ing deficits.
Thus France is getting about
two and a half times as much
help as Western Germany, with
a similar population and a
greater industrial potential. The
Netherlands, with a much
smaller population and industry,
is scheduled to receive more out-
side aid than Germany.

Russians Wearing Shoes. —Effect of
Russian censorship noted by Wash-
ington “Post”: “One correspondent
[who was in Moscow] tells of writiflg
a story on generally-improving
economic conditions in which he
stated that some Muscovites could be
seen wearing well-shined shoes. The
censors immediately thought of
‘shined’ in the connotation of shiny
trousers. What emerged from their
blue-pencilling was the statement that
some Muscovites could be seen wear-

Cheers for N.Z. —Dr. Edith Sum-

Ministry of Food), speaking in the
House of Commons: “Australian
supplies of carcass meat in 1948 and
the forecasts for 1949 were lower
than in 1947 and some 50,000 tons
below what we had pre-war. The
one bright spot is New Zealand
[cheers], from which supplies are
coming at a high level. The 360,000
tons of carcass meat we received from
New Zealand was 100,000 tons more
than pre-war.”

Blinded in War. —■ St. Dunstan’s
(Britain) annual report shows 4500
men and women blinded since 1914
as a result of war it’s ex-
pected that over the next 20 years
the number will be increased by de-
layed traumatic blindness. After the
first war many men were trained to
work ia their own homes at handi-
crafts, but this, though remunerative,
is stated to have had grave disadvan-
tages. Therefore since 1939 blinded
men haye been trained to operate
semi-automatic machinery and work
on assembly, packing and testing jobs
in factories. “They have kept the
jobs with remarkable success, and
there have been no accidents.”

H.C. of Occupation. —As stated in
reply to a question in the House of
Commons, the total cost to the United
Kingdom of the occupation of Ger-
many from the end of hostilities to

by the U.K. up to July 31 last,
£30,400,000.

Lukewdrm J. Bull. —U.S. suspicions
that Britain, or at any rate the Attlee
Government, is lukewarm, not to say
downright cold, towards a European
Union would not be allayed by the
appointment of Mr. Dalton to lead
the British delegation or the London
“Times” comment thereon: “There
is something perverse in the choice
of a man so deeply committed to the
theory, never plausible and now obvi-
ously absurd, that European unity can
be based only on a union of Socialist
States. The most charitable ex-
planation is that Mr. Dalton was the

French View Germany. —Evidently
De Gaulle is anything but alone in
advocating a federated Germany as
French policy. LondDn “Times”
Paris correspondent, reporting that
“French opinion considers that only
through European federation can the
German problem be solved,” adds:
“It is recognised that Germany—or,
for the moment, Western Germany —
must take her place in Europe, but
it is insisted that she must be in-
capable of turning again into a tyrant,
It is argued that this can be done
only through federation; only when
it sees other nations pooling some
of their sovereignty, it is urged, will
a future German Government be
ready to do the same.”

Not Really So Bad. —Mrs. Mann

disappointment to the New York elec-
torate; it would occasion no surprise
to the Western world.”

Soviet Snags in Germany. —A Berlin
correspondent of N. Y. “Times” has
advanced the interesting view that
one of the chief obstacles to Russian
Communising of Germany, apart >
from the overriding economic element,
is that the plans to that end were
originally made for Slav countries,
and hence don’t work with Germans,
who are not merely not Slavs but
predominantly anti-Slav. Also, “in
the technique of modern industrial
civilisation” the Germans are “at least
30 years ahead of the Russians.”

Atlantic-Pact Forces. The U.S.
Government, a London correspondent
of N. Y. “Times” has reported, if

forces capable of holding off at
assault by Russia on the West would
be 20 divisions. To hold off an all-
out air-bome invasion 1000 to 150 C
jet-fighters would be needed; the
present air-strength is given as about
half that. Raising and equipping such
minimum forces and preparing the
necessary ground and air facilitiel
would take about two years,

JOCK GARDEN'S PLAN.
Twenty years ago it would have been
unbelievable that J, S, (“Jock”) Garden
and some of his Comrades could, by
today, have achieved so much in their
objective of leading “Labor” along the
Garden path to “Bolshevisation.” The
events of the 1925 Federal election
campaign serve as a background
against which to observe developments.
In that campaign Communism became a
prime issue, and there was published a
photograph, taken in Moscow, which
showed Mr. Garden and two of his Aus-
tralian Comrades posed with a group of
unpleasant-looking Asiatics, some of them
instigators of the policies which have
brought about the present chaotic state
of affairs in the countries to the north
of us and the defection of others from
the old British-guided Governments under
which they were making real progress.
The electorates recoiled so heartily
from the spectacle presented by Comrade
Garden and his friends that the “Labor”
party went to extreme lengths to demon-
strate that the picture was a forgery, a
purpose in which it failed. The “Workers’
Weekly,” December 11, 1925, wrote:
Comrade Garden has consistently de-
clared his pride to be associated with the
revolutionary workers of the Eastern coun-
tries, and now points out the hypocrisy of
the A.L.P., which has invited the represen-
tatives from those countries to attend the
Pan-Pacific Conference to be held next
year. Mr. Holloway issued the invitations,
but refrained from admitting such a crime
during the elections.
Within 20 years Mr. Holloway was a
Minister in a Federal Cabinet which
seemed proud to be part of the Asian bloc
built up by Mr. Garden’s ruffian associ-
ates in Red-square, and Mr. Garden him-
self, campaign-director and bosom friend
of another Minister, could claim, with
some justice, that he had realised his plan
of 1925, namely, that the Federal “Labor”
party must be “Bolshevised,” Bolshevisa-
tion including the destruction or mislaying
of the White Australia policy.
That policy is mislaid, though the
public does not yet realise it. Like Mr.
Holloway, Mr. Calwell would shrink from
“admitting such a crime,” even while he
camouflages the position by ostentatiously
expelling friendly Tongans and others who
have been long resident in the country.
And his Government has lined itself up
with the Communist-party policy in inter-
national affairs, voting time and again
on the side of the predominantly Asiatic
U.S.S.R. and against European countries
of kindred blood, long friendship and
close economic and defensive relation-
ship, and promoting the schemes of
States like India which have just come out
of the melting-pot and which have yet
to prove their justification for existence
by establishing stable government.
Just now the Chifley Government is
described as having been placed out on
a limb by the unthinking and violent
eagerness with which it rushed to cham-
pion the cause of the bloodstained rabble
“Administration” of Jogjakarta—a hybrid
thing made up partly of Jap collaboration
and organisation, partly of Com-
munist material derived from the organis-
ations which came into being under the
hands of the Pan-Pacific organisation of
Messrs. Garden and Holloway, and with a
little brindle of pure banditry that comes
from the ruffian element which always
attaches itself to insurrection.
In the interests of these people
the Canberra Government has sat
passive while the wharflaborers, led
by Communists, drive millions of
pounds a year in trade and valu-
able Dutch shipping out of Australian
ports at the behest of a hostile foreign
country. These “Indonesians” it has
tacitly supported through thick and thin
in asserting their right to hold the very
doorstep of Australia—the main jumping-
off place for invasion of the north of this
country—wresting it from the hands of
our white allies of the Netherlands. It
indicated approval when Burma obtained
its “freedom” —a freedom which was
celebrated in 1947 by a meeting between
Mr. Attlee and some of its entrepreneurs,
only one of whom has since escaped the
assassin’s dagger or the necessity to flee
for safety from other “freedom-loving
democrats.” . That one was Mr. U-Saw,
who has been hanged for murder.
Dr. Evatt interfered in the racial issues
between South Africa and India, again
accepting the Communist viewpoint and
taking the side of coloreds against the
whites. Yet when the British Government,
in defiance of a specific agreement and
Australian rights, meekly handed over its
foothold in Egypt to an insolent gaggle
of Egyptians who have since been treat-
ing European visitors with impudence,
there was not a word said. Dr. Evatt,
however, felt bound to put his foot into
the Palestine mess at a time when it
was most likely to embarrass Britain.
The subsequent violent proceedings
have cost thousands of lives, includ-
ing that of one of Europe’s most beloved
citizens. Count Bernadette. At present
it looks as if Britain may have to step
in and retrieve Egypt from the condition
of “freedom” in which it and half a
dozen other States, allowed to give
play to their turbulent fancies and
a desire to spread their wings unchecked
by civilised Western supervision, are be-
ing licked to a frazzle by a well-organised
Jewish minority which has all the ferocity
of a jaguar and a mysterious backing
from Eastern Europe which gives it
abundant arms and aircraft “made in
Czechoslovakia.”
Even the supine Attlees wakened to
the dangers of the Egyptian situation and
to the fact that if they did not act to pre-
vent it, if necessary by force, they might
find the Suez Canal and the R.A.A.F.’s
and the Royal Navy’s oil supply in the
hands of the tools of Moscow, and
Africa physically invaded by Bolshevism.
Their prompt action is in strong'contrast
to what the Australian Government
did when Java was taken over by the
handful of noisy rebels who created there
the enclave which would soon have been
a Moscow plaything if the Netherlands
had not stepped in a few weeks ago and
shown the Jogjakarta “Government” for
the feeble thing it was. If Holland had
not moved, even at the expense of in-
curring the savage denunciation of Dr.
Evatt’s outfit, the now-fugitive Com-
munists would have undoubtedly returned
to the charge and with more success than
last time.
The pains with which Dr. Evatt and his
friends have taken every opportunity
to embarrass the interests of this
country and other parts of the British
Commonwealth are amazing. To an-
tagonise South Africa, which commands
the bases protecting our western flank, to
give away the oil of the Indies area and
the positions in it strategically important
to our defence to people with the back-
ing of Communism seems like the act of
a fool of a hitherto-unrecorded magni-
tude. Of the same order were the approval
of the giving-away of the strategic Suez
and Nile delta to a people which cannot
govern or protect itself, the selection of
the unstable Indian and other Asian re-
publics as associates in preference to
Western nations, and the antagonising of
the Americans by a policy in Japan which
is playing into Moscow’s hands.
Now Dr. Burton, who has been elevated
to the headship of the inflated External
Affairs Department by much the same
process which has blessed the country with
the services of Mr. Sam Atyeo and Pro-
fessor Bailey, is to be sent to Delhi to
observe the situation there in a conference
of Indonesian partisans. He is taking with
him another young man.
Of the acceptance of the invitation all
that can be said is that it is as incredible
as most of the rest of the performances of
the Government under the Foreign
Affairs policy of the busybody gentleman
who is returning to Australia from his
real country —the world at large—for a
short visit.
Mr. Menzies has come home with no
delusions about what is happening. He
says that the international position is
“precarious” ;, that “Russia throughout
the world is regarded as a threat to
peace”; that, though the Kremlin “may
not be contemplating immediate military
attack,” it is “getting by aggression every-
thing it can short of actual warfare,” and
must be stopped from going further.
Part of what the U.S.S.R. is getting it
is achieving with the help, direct or in-
direct, of the Australian “Labor” Gov-
ernment. And, at the rate at which
Dr. Evatt and his friends are mov-
ing, this country may be regarded
in a decade by the European world
as part of Asia, with the same
ideals and status as some of the curious
associates which its “leaders” have
chosen lately in preference to long-
standing and civilised friends among the
white races. From his present place of
confinement even “Jock” Garden must
sometimes marvel at the strides a former
High Court Judge has made in promoting
the policies of which he himself was the
Australian father, and in aiding
“the revolutionary workers of Eastern
countries” towards their Communist goal.
His own astrology magazine might have
felt timid about predicting it.
Incentives and Production.
In the seclusion of his country pub
Mr, Chifley might find time to reflect on
the disaster approaching his whole plan
of “full employment” and “social
security” because of his Government’s
now-admitted failure to increase man-
hour production. He can find little
satisfaction in recalling all his cajqjing
and imploring of the unions throughout
1948 to give a full day’s work for their
increased pay. He must adopt other,
realistic measures soon.
Election year should provide some
additional goad to action by this
“Labor” Government. Mr. Chifley has
exhausted the process of calling confer-
ences, or sounding opinion on both sides
in industry, to find a way out of the
impasse. He has been told by the em-
ployers—and he knows (as his own state-
ments have shown) they are right—that
the prime remedies for the anaemic con-
dition of industry are ,(l) adequate sup-
plies of coal, and (2) the abandonment
by employees of the slowed-down tempo
of work and output (which applies most
notably in the coalmines). Mr. Chifley
is here in direct conflict with his Govern-
ment’s stupid creed that the profit motive
in industry is the root of all evil, for
every union member has the profit motive
obviously and deeply in his heart.
Every conference or informal talk on
industrial relations arranged by the
Prime Minister has been brought face to
face with (1) urgent demand for a reduc-
' tion in the Federal Treasury’s own pro-
fiteering through heavy taxation levies on
industry, its managers, and its operatives
alike, and (2) the proposal for incentive-
payments to employees ( i.e extra
profit) to increase man-hour output within
the 40-hour week. It has been demon-
strated beyond all argument to Mr.
Chifley that if a system of extra payments
by results were not accompanied by a
relaxation of taxation rates on both the
employers who make these payments and
the employees who receive them, then
any incentive to harder work would be
diminished, if not negatived entirely.
Moreover, the whole purpose is, by in-
creasing output against inflated modern
costs, to check the rising price of com-
modities to the consumer.
Mr. Chifley knows ail this. But be-
cause he has paid but lip-service to the
only policy in sight which can succeed,
the unions receive with indifference his
appeals for greater effort. His taxation
remissions have been but niggardly and
superficial. His silence on the matter of
any Treasury contribution to greater
man-hour production has been profound.
And now the spectre of economic disaster
which he descried in the distance 10
months ago—involving the doom of his
“full-employment” policy, of “Labor’s”
boasted improved living standard, of the
uneasy prosperity of his cheap money,
and, lastly, but not least impressive, of
his own Administration —is approaching
to place an inexorable hand upon his
shoulder.
While his Minister for Labor is com-
mitted to a new drive to get bonus and
wages accepted—for it is “poor old Hol-
loway’s” department which is ordered to
prepare “a review of incentive-payments
in Australia and overseas” for propa-
ganda among the unions—the executive
of the A.C.T.U., dominated ever since
September, 1947, by a Communist resolu-
tion, announces that its congress next
September may be asked to abandon its
opposition to this device. Mr. Chifley
just cannot afford to wait till next Sep-
tember, nor can the Australian people.
For about six months, in gingerly
fashion, “poor old Holloway” has been
trying to stage another joint industrial
conference to devise ways and means for
getting higher man-hour output. He has
toyed with a suggestion that if em-
ployers would finally resign themselves
to a 40-hour week and pay incentive rates
for overtime, the log-jam might be moved.
The employers have retorted plainly
that that does not promise increased man-
hour production ; that what is wanted is
incentive-payments for greater output
within the 40-hour week. Meekly
dropping this card under the table Mr.
Holloway made noises suggesting that he
had been trying to palm it, and proceeded
to say that all he wanted to do was to
distinguish between greater production
and cheaper production through exploit-
ation of the workers. The only exploita-
tion to be permitted is, of course, by
the workers. But since that does not
get more production, everybody is back
to the decisions of Mr. Chifley’s confer-
ence of August, 1947.
There, after much manoeuvring by
“Labor” Ministers and the A.C.T.U.
against the employers’ adamant stand on
the facts of daily experience, it was
agreed that incentive-payments should
be given a trial. The A.C.T.U. executive
twins, Messrs. Monk and Clarey, pledged
to recommend them asked their Sep-
tember congress to authorise an investiga-
tion of the incentive system as an experi-
ment.
But those “philosophers” under Mr.
Chifley’s tolerant, not to say indulgent,
political patronage were lying in ambush
for Messrs. Monk and Clarey. Communist
Rowe (the one who later ran away from
the police in Queensland) got up and
moved an amendment that “Congress re-
ject acceptance of any incentive system
as a means of increasing production” ;
and in spite of Mr. Clarey’s tearful plea
that the meeting should not “humiliate its
representatives and repudiate their
promise to the Prime Minister,” the
Communist vote carried the day. The
same industrial bushrangers used their
advantage forthwith, in a series of resolu-
tions, to humiliate” every authority in
sight.
Since that day the A.C.T.U. executive
has refused to look on incentive-payments
again, or even to permit debate of the
question. Every formal declaration
favoring higher production by A.C.T.U.
officials (reiterated each new moon), all
supporting resolutions of “Labor” con-
ferences (like those of every A.L.P. con-
ference during 1948), and every appeal
such as Mr. Chifley and “Fixer” Ashley
still make ad nauseam fromf any
opportune “Labor” platform mean abso-
lutely nothing. The conference which
Mr. Chifley and six other Federal Minis-
ters had last October with 140 delegates
representative of all phases of Australian
industry pledged itself to support some-
thing called “the ‘Labor’ Government’s
drive for increased production,” though
it did not really abandon a conviction
that economic disaster would attend not
the, present go-slow, but the increased
effort to which the Prime Minister was
trying to persuade them. Insisting that
the Government should lead off with
some tricks of its own, the meeting re-
solved that Mr. Chifley should pass
legislation “to prevent speeding-up of the
workers and to ensure that higher pro-
duction is not followed by profiteering
and further inequality in the distribution
of the national wealth.”
Thereby, too, was revealed how this
Federal Ministry has, through its crude
vote-catching propaganda, indoctrinated
the unions with the idea that the main-
tenance of the socialistic policy depends
on a class-war expressed by doing not
more work, but less, for the higher wages
demanded. Hence, also, the Communist
slogan seen scrawled on fences: “Peg
prices, increase wages.”
It is demonstrably true, as the secretary
of the Victorian Taxpayers’ Association
said the other day, that the Federal
Government’s penal taxation upon all
enterprise and productive effort is “mak-
ing everyone allergic to work.” It is
true, also, as R. G. Casey declared
recently, that higher pay is not the whole
answer, and that what has to be cured is
an attitude of mind —a “philosophy,” as
Mr. Chifley would put it. There is no
question that the 40-hour week is ruin-
ing industry because it has played down
to this destructive mental attitude and
is adding an intolerable burden to the cost
of living. The Associated Chambers of
Manufactures, in a considered statement
through its director, asserted even before
the recent increases in the basic wage
that the 40-hour week had raised labor
costs by 11 per cent, and reduced out-
put by 8 to 12 per cent. The Common-
wealth Government no longer dares call
for the testimony on this point of those
experts it put up before the Court 18
months ago to compute the assured bene-
fits of the 40-hour week on the national
economy.
Mr. Chifley has, in Mr. Churchill’s
words, “broken the mainspring of indi-
vidual initiative.” And he won’t find an
adequate replacement part among the
general run of “Labor” stock-in-trade.
Faced with desperate reality, a “Labor”
leader may again be forced to break with
“ ‘Labor’ policy.”
Wool Wealth.
It is doubtful if any Australian news in
recent years has attracted so much,
American attention as the high prices
for wool. The new record of 13s.
3d. a pound at Geelong sales last week
will be headline news in Boston, U.S.A.,
where woollen manufacturers are doing
a lot of deep thinking about the Aus-
tralian wool prices and the falling-off in
American wool production. The wearing
of woollen garments by Americans got
a tremendous fillip during the 1939-45
wars, when millions of them discovered
in military service that for all practical
purposes the woollen garment was
supreme. Millions went back to civilian
life determined to wear wool.
American textile manufacturers were
quick to sense this popular appetite and
set about satisfying it. To their surprise
they discovered that their own sheep


numbers were failing, that Australia was
the great producer of the kinds of wool
they wanted, that other countries quickly
recognised that in the post-war world
wool was “as good as gold,” and that
raw-wool prices were booming. A year
ago American buyers appeared at Aus-
tralian wool auctions; then they dis-
covered that it was more profitable to
stay out of the Australian sales and buy
the wool from European countries hungry
for dollar credits. But the gradual re-
storation of European woollen mills, the
revival of Japan and the sudden hunger
for wool displayed by Russia have some-
what complicated matters for the Ameri-
cans.
Wool is now a major item in American
economy. People like F. E. Ackerman,
of the American Wool Council, are
quoted by papers like the “Wall-street
Journal” in warnings against the onset of
artificial fibres. Chicago “Tribune” in
mid-December warned its readers that
the American lamb-drop this year was
the lowest on record; that American
sheep numbers had fallen from 56 million
in 1942 to 35 million this year:
With wool a vital war material, this drop
in domestic sheep numbers is regarded by
livestock and wool-industry leaders as dis-
turbing. The United States now is depen-
dent for the largest percentage of its fine
wools upon Australia, several thousand
miles away. Other large overseas suppliers
are New Zealand, South Africa and
Argentina.
The United States now is using wool
for apparel at the rate of about one billion
(1000 million) pounds a year. Before the
war the consumption rate was roughly 600
million pounds annually. In the 1935-39
period the United States produced about
450 million pounds of its own wool and
imported more than 93 million pounds.
Last year this country produced only slightly
more than 300 million pounds and imported
an estimated 500 million pounds.
The decrease in sheep numbers has
occurred despite the fact that world de-
mand for fine wools necessary to meet
American requirements has exceeded world
production by an amount estimated by some
experts at as much as 50 per cent.
Something of this sort prompted Curt
E. Forstmann, head of a U.S. woollen
company, to come to Australia and look
us over. When he got back, New York
“Journal of Commerce” printed a column
of his impressions. The rise in prices he
put down to “large purchases by Italy,
France, United Kingdom and Russia,”
adding,
it is paradoxical that these countries,
which, with the exception of Russia, are
maintaining their economies op money
borrowed from us, are in a position to
inflate world wool prices at the expense of
American manufacturers and the American
public If the American demand for
wool textiles is diminished the present costs
of fine wools will be but one of the con-
tributing reasons. The others are the con-
tinued demands of labor for ever-increasing
wage-levels and the increasing burden placed
upon industry by taxation.
The paramount job for both management
and labor at this time is to keep costs and
selling-prices at a point where we will not
price ourselves out of our markets. To-
day the wool-textile industries must operate
at 70 per cent, of capacity merely to break
even. Any material change in the present
high rate of demand by the consuming
public would quickly reduce wool-textile
production below costs of mill operation,
with serious results to the industry and to
labor.
“Dalgety’s Wool Review” —incidentally
its 50th annual issue, and a valuable out-
line of the wool position in Australia
and New Zealand —believes the world
supplies of Merino and fine crossbreds
are “likely to lag behind demand for some
years to come,” and that
No really effective substitute for wool has
yet been produced, despite enormous ex-
penditure in research and experimental
work, but a very helpful means has been
provided for manufacturers to cheapen the
cost of the finished (woollen) product by
adulteration with cheaply-produced syn-
thetics. When wool prices rule on a
dangerously high level the incentive to eke
out supplies by skilful blending with other
fibres may prove irresistible.
After an examination of the systems of
finance operating in woolbuying, the
“Review” finds that “on the whole,
assuming peace is maintained, there
should be no drastic fall in wool prices
in the immediate future.” Cynical as it
may sound, it is war and threats of war,
not peace, which bump up wool prices.
Wool is as much a munition of war as
bombs, a fact which America realises,
Britain has long known, and Russia has
apparently discovered.
Obviously, whether it" is wanted for
manufacturing or as a form of currency,
wool is in short supply, and that is why
prices are high. It is now by far the
greatest single source of Australian
wealth. It earned us over £155 million
for the 1947-48 season, £5O million more
than the previous, record and more than
double the 1938-39 amount.
Whether Australians fully realise just
what the wool industry and high wool
prices mean to them and whether they
—or their Governments for them—are
apt to forget about wool while chasing
political chimeras and false economic
theories, such as that which supposes that
people who work less can consume more,
are questions which give rise to disturbing
speculation.
PLAIN ENGLISH
Truman's "Fair Deal."
Cabled forecasts from the American
press of President Truman’s “State of the
Nation” message to the new Congress—
an outline of the legislation he holds
necessary—were accurately enough drawn.
The second, and larger, edition of the
“New Deal” embodies;
The President’s acquittal of his debt to
the Labor vote by his jettisoning (with
certain reservations) of the Taft-Hartley
Act which spiked the guns of militant
union executives.
“Social security” by means of a national
health-insurance scheme; financial sub-
sidies to improve education; “stand-by”
price-controls and limited wage-controls to
combat inflation (entailing more subsidies);
higher minimum wage; aid to farmers; and
equal rights for negroes.
Maintenance of economic and military
commitments in Europe; restoration of
universal military training.
Heavy taxation to pay for all these, the
extra to fall chiefly on corporations.
Exactly what checks are intended on
“unfair labor practices” by the unions has
yet to be made clear. The original
(Wagner) Labor Relations Act is to be
restored ; of this the (Taft-Hartley) Labor
Management Relations Act was an
amendment; and the new legislation, “re-
enacting the Wagner Act,” will extend
that Act to ban “jurisdictional strikes”
(arising from inter-union quarrels) and
strikes called in sympathy with stoppages
in unrelated industries. The method of
barring such strikes and the penalties to
be imposed will be the all-important
details, and the Taft-Hartley Act, which
certainly quelled a lot of militancy, set
an impressive example with its machinery
for combating strikes.
The economic controls proposed are
obviously meant to check inflation, some
of the forces of which will receive stimu-
lation from “social-security” and other
spending. Controls, wisely, include
“limited wage-controls.” The revised
“New Deal” also assumes a full place for
private enterprise in collaboration with
the Government in Mr, Truman’s
domestic plans. Obviously the President
is out to combat Communism at home
with prosperity-planning. High taxation
of employers and universal military train-
ing of all classes are disciplinary accom-
paniments to the good time hoped to* be
had by all, and the United States’ huge
financial commitments in aid of Europe
—economic and military—cannot be ful-
filled without increased Treasury revenue.
This is the means by which the President
supports also the fight against Commun-
ism abroad.
The buttress on which the American
legislation may rely—as that of the
Socialists in Australia cannot —is that the
community is habituated to hard work
for full production. President Truman
reports the highest per-capita output in
his country’s history. The spotlight at
present resting on the plans for “social
security” must soon be turned on Wash-
ington’s policy for ending the Berlin
blockade and the deadlock with Russia;
that U.S.A. means to stand up to the
Soviet should be confirmed by its sign-
ing of the Atlantic pact with the Western
Union Powers later this month,
A showdown cannot be long delayed.
Nurses Join Doctors.
Hardly had Senator McKenna an-
nounced that he had washed his hands of
negotiation with the B.M.A. over his
National Health (Socialisation of Medical
Services) Act when, as already forecast
(B. 29/12/’4B), the Nurses’ Association
told him where he got off if he meant to
socialise them.
The N.S.W. branch, at a mass meeting,
recorded that;—
The Minister had solemnly promised to
call a conference of nurses’ representatives
before any health bill was put before the
Commonwealth Parliament, and had failed
to do so.
The meeting then resolved that Senator
McKenna should be requested to meet
nurses’ representatives within a month,
and to provide, by amendment of the Act
or by regulation, for control of nursing
to be left in the hands of the nurses.
Having regard to the Minister’s admission
that the operation of his health scheme
ultimately might mean the end of private
medical practice, the nurses’ precautions
are fully justified.
Of Senator McKenna’s hasty rejoinder
from somewhere in the vicinity of his
chief’s bush-pub hideout, that no control
of nurses is proposed and full opportunity
for consultation will be afforded, it is
to be observed that the Minister began by
talking in exactly the same reassuring
way to the doctors.
• On the doctors’ side silence has been
broken by a group of “younger members
of the 8.M.A.” in Victoria, whose views
(ventilated by Melbourne “Age”) are ex-
pressed as doubting the wisdom of “th
B.M.A.’s stonewall attitude.” But this
will not go very far to console the
Socialists. The “younger members” ■
suggest that the B.M.A. should issue “a
plain statement” to the Minister and to
the public of “what it really thinks neces-
sary to improve medical services,” and,
particularly, that the B.M.A. should agree
that: *
Society as a whole rather than the in-
dividual should meet medical costs by
some form of insurance on a contributpry
basis: if not by extension of the existing
medical benefits scheme, then by the patient
presenting the doctor’s receipt and being
reimbursed by the State.
Portion of the social-services tax applied
to medical benefits should be used for
building, improving and re-equipping hos-
pitals, sanatoria, etc., and extending pre-
ventive measures against ill-health.
That it is “a retrograde step to spend
money on [the Government’s] general medi-
cal service till all these matters are put in
order,” and that “no such service would
be in the public interest, introducing all the
evils of Government control.”
That the B.M.A. will set about creating
a better national medical service of its own
devising, with group practice under self-
governing groups, with a special committee
to advise in each State.
There is little to be found in these
representations not already put forward
by the B.M.A. negotiators, save perhaps
the call for the B.M.i\. to take the lead in
hammering out a practical scheme. The
B.M.A. could add to its strong case by
making its views more widely and plainly
understood.
It may be true that the public is indif-
ferent towards “free” medicine and “free”
medical services because today everybody
is relatively prosperous, and that this
attitude may change as times grow harder.
If the present deadlock with the B.M.A.
is merely political tactics —meant to dis-
guise the Government’s refusal to disclose
or compromise on its socialisation plans—
then the sooner the truth is brought out
the better. That also is up to the B.M-A.
Government by Appointees.
Nowra, heart of a big dairying and
tourist district 100 miles south of Sydney,
seems to have been singled out for ex-
periment under the McGirr Government’s
plan for centralising local government.
Nowra was formerly a municipality ; it is
now the headquarters of the Shoalhaven
Shire, a body comprised of an amalgama-
tion of no fewer than seven formerly
separate council areas. The McGirr
Minister for Amalgamation is a Mr.
Cahill. Six or seven months ago Mr.
Cahill demonstrated his power under the
new Local Government Act by appoint-
ing a couple of his own nominees to the
Shoalhaven Council, irrespective of the
fact that the citizens had rejected the
gentlemen concerned when up for election
a few months before that.
As was pointed out when six of the
seven councils objected to the amalgama-
tion—and it mustn’t be forgotten that the
people affected were not allowed to vote
on it—the area was too big and unwieldy
for a single council. Mr. Cahill ignored
this, but the new council collided with
the fact almost at once. There then
appeared something which few people
knew about: Section 530 a of the Act.
which empowers the Cahill councils to
appoint committees which, as “The Shire
and Municipal Record” puts it, “exercise
the powers delegated to them with all the
authority of the council.” In other words,
such a committee may be appointed to
administer a distant or difficult part of
a local-government area and, in fact, be-
comes the council.
In Shoalhaven it comes to this: Mr.
Cahill amalgamated the seven councils
into one; to that one council he appointed
two of his own nominees (provisionally,
because the McGirr Government had
ordered all local-government elections
postponed for a year); the one council
now appoints committees to run the
former self-governing areas. Thus ap-
pointed persons are substituted for elected
ones, and it makes no difference that the
council which appoints them is an elected
one. But if the Minister has power to
appoint councillors, what’s to stop him
appointing delegate committees, either
directly or through his appointees to a
council?
In view of the job in front of them the
Shoalhaven councillors probably couldn’t
manage their job without the assistance
of the committees. But the set-up does
show what amalgamation can lead to,
and it does suggest that local government
is no longer in the hands of local people,
but in those of a Minister in a distant
capital city. And more than ever it sug-
gests that when the McGirr Government
denied the citizens the right to vote on
the amalgamations it was guilty of gross
and impudent abuse of its powers.
Africa as Meat-producer.
If what the British Under-Secretary for
Colonies told reporters last week—and
British newspapers featured the news—
is all it seems the Australian export-
beef industry will have to sit up and take
notice. A British scientist. Dr. Curd, is
reported to have discovered a drug that
will render cattle immune from the tsetse
fly. Dr. .Curd was killed in a railway acci-
dent about a month ago, but his sub-
ordinates have the formula safe.
If true, the drug, known as antrycide,
will free 4,500,000 square miles of Africa
from the fly, which causes sleeping-sick-
ness in man and beast, and enable the
raising of millions of cattle. It was said
that eventually 30,000,000-head would be
grazing there, leading to a greater beef
output than that of Argentina.
Virtues claimed for the drug are that
it can be safely and simply administered
without the aid of a vet., that it has no
undesirable effect on animals, and that it
can be mixed in a spray to be spread by
aeroplanes and would thus “wipe out
90 p.c. of the flies.”
Though not much has been said about
it, Britain is obviouslj concentrating on
Africa as a new and vastly-expanded area
for production of foodstuffs and other
raw materials and as a defence base.
With Burma, India, Palestine and Egypt
lost to British control, Africa becomes
important as a link between Britain and
the southern Pacific Dominions. Britain
has vast plans for agricultural develop-
ment there, notably in Kenya and
Rhodesia, and the control of tsetse fly
would be a tremendous achievement. At
the same time it could throw Argentina’s
cattle industry back on its heels and check
Australian beef-export aspirations. Beef-
raising in with a vast reservoir of
native labor to draw upon, and cheap
land, could put high-living Australia out
of beef-raising for export.
In a Little Bush Pub.
Well, it’s good to get away from it all
for a while. It’s been a trying year, but
we weathered it. Wonder what this one'll
bring? It’ll be a crucial year for the
party —I mean for Australia. Mustn’t
think of that now, though. I’ve come
here to relax. This stack of whodunits
ought to do the trick. Nothing like a
good thriller to keep your mind off things.
What’s this one? The Great Trunk
Mystery . Sounds all right. Seems a
newie. Is it though? Trunk? Hang-it
all, can’t I get away from that* sort of
thing? There was nothing in it of course,
but the way the Opposition and the press
put it made it sound nasty. Dirty of ’em
to go down into the grave to traduce a
dead man. Still, I suppose that’s politics.
A pity old Dick died in America. Rather
inconsiderate of him. If only he’d waited
till he got home it would have saved a lot
of trouble.
The Road to Buenos Aires? Doesn’t
sound like a thriller. Travel book, I sup-
pose, or one of those Bob Hope films.
White-slave traffic? Must’ve been meant
for Senator O’Flaherty. Pity Calwell got
so pigheaded over those girls. Don’t
suppose they’d have voted for us, any-
way. That’s the trouble with Arthur.
Opens his big mouth and lets his
tongue run on before his brain’s decided
what to say. He ought to try the strong,
silent pose for a change. It pays. Paid
me, anyway. But once he’s spoken I’ve
got to stand by him. Hit one, hit the lot,
that’s me. Yes, O’Flaherty can have
Buenos Aires. I came here to relax.
This one seems better —Mud in Your
Eye. Not a murder, but there’s probably
a bit of mystery in it. This’ll do. Mud?
Funny how that makes me think of Dan
Mulcahy. Influence of the press, I sup-
pose. We’ll have to do something about
it. They seem to say just what they like
about us. Wonder if we could do some-
thing about it. Control of radio; why
not control of the press? Confound the
Constitution; it’s a drag on all sorts of
progressive legislation. Still, if we
muzzled the press I suppose we’d have
to put Arthur in charge, and he’d need a
muzzle himself. Hang it all, I read for
relaxation. I’d better try something else.
What’s the next one? The Tropic
Garden Case ? - What! Must be a coin-
cidence. It’s sub judice ; I mustn’t think
of that, and, besides, I came here for a
rest, free from cares and all that. But
perhaps it might have been better if I'd
given Eddie his Royal Commission 12
months ago when he first asked me. At
least, I think he asked me. Smart lad,
Eddie, but talks too much. Doesn’t say
much, of course, but he says it too often.
There I go, thinking again. It’s no
good ; must get on with some reading.
The Wide, Brown Land? Indonesia, I
suppose. Better pass it on to Bert, if he‘s
got time to pick it up as he goes by.
There’s a bloke, now. Clever enough and
all that, but talks too much. Gosh, how
he talks! Wish he’d stay still long enough
to prime me up a bit on his — ex—-our
foreign policy. Indonesia? Never did
like the Dutch,
That reminds me. Better suggest to
Cosgrove that he change the name of Tas-
mania, Might offend the Indonesians
having it named after a Dutchman. Nice
bloke, Cosgrove. A bit fond of the gee-
gees, of course, but then aren’t all the
boys? What was the name of that horse
Bill Ashley was telling me about? Flying
Duck or something. Never can remember
that sort of thing. I ought to write ’em

down like Bill Urquhart did. Gosh, there
I go again. Better get back to the books
—thrillers of course, not the racecourse
kind. Huh! This Wide, Brown Land
thing’s poetry. That’s not in Bert’s line.
Better give it to Les Haylen. Keep him
quiet for a while. Now for the next.
This looks more like it. The Case
of the Ticking Clock ? Irritating
things, ticking clocks. They ought
to make ’em rilent like wrist-watches.
Maxie was indiscreet over his watch
business. What was that Pollard
said to him? “You wouldn’t know what
was happening if the House fell on you.”
I think he would, though ; Maxie’s not
so dumb as all that. Quite smart in his
way. Talks a lot, of course, but so do
most of our chaps, more’s the pity. Any-
way, he’s a goner now they’ve turned him
down in Watson. Wonder what we’d
better do about his pension?
Can’t worry about it now ; I came here
to rest. The Case of the Missing Teller?
Bank-robbery, I suppose. Funny how
that bank bloke disappeared, though. Still,
people are always running off, losing their
memories and that sort of thing. That
reminds me. Wonder if we’re really the
certs Bert thinks we are for the Privy
Council appeal? Clever bloke, Bert, but
sometimes I’m afraid he might be a little
too clever. Must talk to him about it if
I can get him to sit still long enough.
The Documents in the Case ? Sounds
familiar. Oh, yes, I remember. The
documents were stolen. If they weren’t
stolen they were forged. One or the
other. Anyway, I’ve read it. That’s the
lot. Rotten batch of books. Think I'll
drop in on Percy Spender and see if his
wife’s written any decent thrillers lately.
POLITICAL POINTS
The Victorian political jigsaw still defies
all efforts of newspaper tipsters to fit
the scrambled pieces into a coherent de-
sign. A Melbourne “Herald” “discovery”
that Humpty-Dumpty Dunstan and Carl-
ton’s Mr. Barry were plotting some kind
of an alliance against the Liberal Gov-
ernment was reported in most inter-
state papers but ignored by the “Argus,”
which had run the rumor a couple of
Weeks previously. Victorian Liberal-
president Cormack then rushed into print
to announce that his party would contest
all seats. State and Federal, at the next
elections; Premier Hollway said the
same. Dunstan and Barry hotly denied
the intrigue story ; C.P. leader McDonald
was equally emphatic in denying another
story of a possible split in C.P. ranks.
Press utterances notwithstanding, it must
be clear to all concerned that Liberal-
C.P. unity in some form is essential for
the defeat of “Labor.” By the time the
smoke clears away this will need to be
achieved, even if a couple bf political
corpses have to be carried off stage.
Whether or not Communist influence
was responsible for the initial hold-up of
Brisbane’s sanitary services, the Com-
munist-dominated Brisbane Trades and
Labor Council fell over itself in eager-
ness to make the trouble its own. Lord
Mayor Chandler called for volunteers to
help clear up the mess caused by the
breakdown of the service, and the Council
urged the Transport Workers’ Union to
organise picketing squads against the
“scabs”—that epithet which rolls so easily
off a well-trained Comrade’s tongue. The
union refused to become the tool of the
Council; 300 volunteers answered the
Lord Mayor’s appeal, and by Sunday
night the back-lag of a fortnight was
almost overcome.
Federal “Labor” Ministers seem to
have a knack of going out of their way
to antagonise possible supporters in the
white-collar class, Chifley’s appointment
of Dr. Coombs as Governor of-the Com-
monwealth Bank was a slap in the face
to every ambitious man in that institu-
tion as well as in the trading banks. Now
Doctor Evatt, ignoring the claims of
senior officers of the External Affairs De-
partment, has given the job'of Australian
representative on the U.N. Balkans Com-
mission to Sam Atyeo, whose qualifica-
tions appear to be that he can speak
French and paint in the modern manner.
Melbourne Trades Hall secretary Stout
has a simple plan for meeting the threat
of the world recession, the possibility of
which the Prime Minister has hinted. If
bad times come the trade-union move-
ment must press for a shorter working
week in order to spread employment—3o
hours is his suggestion. He adds, “If a
reduction of hours were synchronised
with the introduction of labor-saving
machinery, many disputes about hours
would be eliminated.” It’s quite simple,
but it doesn’t go far enough. Cut out
work altogether and you’ll eliminate all
disputes.
In reply to Premier Playford’s com-
plaint on the coal position of his State
the Prime Minister telegraphed the cold
comfort that
The Coal Board estimates that when the
mines reopen on January 17 the position in
your State will be no worse than that of
other States, as the position will be tight
everywhere.
“Tight” is right, and it is the avowed
policy of the Reds to see that it remains
tight.
Communist Sharkey, in his New Year
message to the faithful, rejoiced that while
capitalism was “rushing headlong to-
wards a new economic disaster” and the
Australian people was “being ruthlessly
plundered by the Collins House
profiteers,” living standards in “the great
Socialist Soviet Union” had “mdre than
doubled in the past year,” Those who
have read previous Communist claims
about- living standards in Russia will
marvel that there was sufficient scope left
for so great an expansion. On Sharkey’s
word the Workers’ Fatherland must be
pretty nearly an earthly paradise by now,
but it is a safe bet that this time next
year Moscow propagandists will be re-
porting a further hundred per cent, im-
provement.
Last week-end five R.A.F. reconnais-
sance planes were shot down by the Jews
near the Egyptian border. Five more
holidays in his heart for Ben Hecht of
the poison pen.
The function of the Joint Coal Board
is to get coal. In pursuit of this objective
it has at times pandered to union whims
and prejudices ; at other times when it
has taken a firm stand its hand has been
forced by “Labor” Ministers influenced
by the same whims and prejudices, so it
is no wonder the mining unions consider
the board’s main duty is to do what
they tell it. Latest example of this atti-
tude occurred at the week-end. Last
Wednesday the board arranged for an
opencut mine on the Western field to
reopen to supply railway coal. The
secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers
snorted that “it was like the board's
damn’ cheek,” and said “there will be
hell to pay if the board has gone behind
the backs of the unions.” All the board
had done was ask a few men to curtail
their holiday in the interests of the com-
munity. The men had agreed. But that
sort of thing is no good to a union boss.
If men agree to stop work, that’s one
thing. Back ’em up by all means. But
if they agree to work, that’s damn’ cheek.
A German stowaway whose fiancee
smuggled him aboard an Australia-
bound steamer at Cyprus by hiding him in
one of her trunks has been refused a
landing permit and will be sent back to
where he came from. If the same thing
had been done with the contents of cer-
tain other trunks a lot of inquisitive ques-
tions might have been avoided,
Menzies got back from abroad with no
illusions about this year’s elections being
easy for Liberals. He expects “a
tremendous political fight,” the result to
“depend very largely on the events of the
next few months.” Events within his own
party, as well as elsewhere, though he
didn’t say so.
Queensland Industrial Court Bench is
to be enlarged from three members to
five, and it is freely tipped on one hand
that Clarrie Fallon, boss of the A.W.U.
and a power in Queensland politics, will
be offered and will accept an appoint-
ment, and on the other hand that he
won’t leave the A.W.U. When this was
written the man himself seemed uncer-
tain. Every Communist in Queensland
would be glad to see him take an appoint-
ment —in some other part of the world.
Premier McGirr is going to have
Sydney’s tram and bus Services investi-
gated by British experts to find out what’s
wrong with them. First the State Auditor-
General and then some inter-State investi-
gators looked into the services and made
recommendations. All the public got
was a progressively worse service and
higher fares. That’s all they’ll get unless
the new investigators’ reports suit the
McGirr Government’s politics. Anyhow,,
why go to Britain? Thousands of Sydney
people can tell Mr. McGirr what’s
wrong: Political control overruled by
union control and the 40-hour week over-
ruling the lot.
When a big bunch of hospital nurses
announced their indignation with the
Federal Government for not consulting
them about the National Health Act, the
news stirred Senator McKenna in his Tas-
manian retreat, and ,he hurriedly an-
nounced that nothing in his Act sought to
“control” or “interfere with” the nursing
profession. He promised to consult the
nurses before doing anything that might
“affect them.” It’s a pity his leader doesn’t
feel the same way about the people in
things like banking.
Candidates with names beginning with
A are still a prime qualification with
“Labor” for Senate selection. In addi-
tion to Amour and Armstrong (sitting
Senators) names up for selection this
year in a list still incomplete include
Atherton, Abel, Alehin and Adam. There
are also six Bs. and seven Cs.
Four Queensland State members have
refused to take part in the politicians’-pen-
sions scheme brought in by the Hanlons.
All are C.P. men —Evans (Mirandi), Head-
ing (Wide Bay), Madsen (Warwick), and
Bjelke-Petersen (Nanango)—and they’ve
probably put up a record for any of the
country’s seven Parliaments. ,
When the Federal Arbitration Court
begins the scheduled hearings of the
still-shorter hours, employers will be able
to quote some embarrassing testimony
from Chifley in rebuttal. His statement
on his return from Britain six months
ago, for instance, that “hard work
and overtime where necessary must be
undertaken,” and that we are in for a
bad time, as he added, even with hard
work. When a press reporter thereupon
asked “whether he thought it necessary
for Australians to work longer hours to
increase production,” Chifley replied that
he had “not given any thought to that
aspect,”
On the authority of Sydney “Tribune,”
more than 300 teachers heard “the truth
on Communism” recently at a meeting
held in “Labor’s” 2KY Auditorium. The
gospel was expounded to them by Mr.
W. Gollan, who, under the auspices of
the N. S. Wales Department of Educa-
tion, dispenses knowledge to ’teen-agers
at Albury High School on week-days and
on Saturday nights, under the auspices
of the Communist party, preaches the
Moscow doctrine over 2AY. Albury
parents who quote the Biblical maxim
about no man being able to serve two
masters probably fall into the class Mr.
Gollan referred to when he told the
teachers that “the reactionary interests
which oppose Communists also oppose
culture and enlightenment.” At the
Sydney gathering “members of the audi-
ence were still eagerly questioning the
speaker when the meeting closed at 10.15
p.m.” After which, suitably buttered up,
the—er—teachers went on their way en-
lightened, clutching 60 “Tribunes” and
other literature on Communism, and
minus £ll 14s. 6d. collected for the
Cause,
Japan’s attempt to drag Australia into
the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity
Sphere failed, but far-sighted Nips must
be smiling to themselves at the present
moment. Thanks to the purblind Evatt-
Chifley policy we. have walked voluntarily
into the ramshackle parlor. It may not
be so easy to walk out again.
Sir William Strang, permanent head of
Britain’s Foreign Office, is on his way to
Asia to study “the rising tide of Asiatic
Communism,” He will visit India,
Pakistan, Japan and probably China and
Indonesia. His study will be incomplete
if he omits a glimpse of that strongpost
of Asiatic Communism Marx House.
A.B.C. news service quoted Mr.
Chambers as saying he was shortly going
to New Guinea “at the request of Mr.
Ward.” If Chambers is administering
External Territories at the wish of the
Prime Minister, why is Eddie making “re-
quests”? Has he handed over his port-
folio or is Cyril merely stooging for
him?
Nokrashy Pasha, assassinated as was
his predecessor, was the fellow who, a
few months ago, was going to show the
world that the Gyppo army could drive
the British garrison out of the Canal
zone, and that the Gyppo Navy (to be
created) would replace Britannia as ruler
of the waves —or some of ’em. Now,
routed by a handful of Jews who have
staged a kind of Exodus in reverse, the
Egyptians are impressed with the' im-
morality of resort to arms, and have
informed U.N.O. that they will accept
conciliation if only the Israelites will obey
U.N.O.’s direction to cease fire. And in
their ungrateful hearts is a prayer of
thanks for the British troops on the Canal.
New Zealanders are soon to be
given a chance by referendum to alter
some of their liquor laws, notably to say
whether they want to retain 6 p.m. closing
or alter it to 10 p.m. A new liquor bill
provides for this and for the setting-up
of a Licensing Control Commission which
will be empowered to issue 20 new
licences and a further five for every popu-
lation increase of 50,000 throughout the
Dominion. Publicans will have to pay
“fair, prices” for the new licences, the
money to go into a special fund for im-
proving and rebuilding hotels. In the
King Country separate polls of whites
and Maoris will be held to decide whether
or not Maoris there can buy liquor. At
present they can’t. The N.Z. Govern-
ment holds power on the Maori vote, and
the separate poll is a compliment to them.
A Maori vote against liquor would carry
the day. The bill generally follows the
recommendations of the 1946 Royal Com-
mission, except that it does not provide
for the nationalisation of breweries. This
could mean that N.Z. has had socialisa-
tion or that booze-making is as sacrosanct
to N.Z. Labor as it is to Australian.
There will probably be coal restrictions
in most parts of Australia dependent on
N.S.W. coal before the miners return to
work next week. “Labor” Ministers’
assurances on Christmas Eve about the
miners having deserved their longer break
by guaranteeing adequate supplies have
turned out to be the usual hooey. By New
Year’s Day S.A. was in distress because
its “last collier for 1948” had left New-
castle less than half-loaded; Playford’s
protests drew the reply that stocks in
Newcastle were" too short even to meet
bunker requirements of ships leaving that
port. As the date when the miners should
resume draws near, the Comtnunist-
bossed Clerks’ Union is staging, as it did
last year, another hold-up of Sydney ship-
ping over a matter of the pick-up of
casual shipping clerks —a point worth
perhaps a quarter-hour’s arbitration.


WHO’S WHO?
“Yes, I know who HE is; but what’s the name o’ the ship?”

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“J.F.”: Sydney traffic is ruthless. Just
before Christmas an elderly man was
knocked down in New South Head-road.
The old chap had stepped off the kerb
to board a tram when a car hit him.
He slumped in the gutter in a sitting posi-
tion, legs out and head drooping and
his walking-stick thrown a dozen feet
away. The driver of the car came
running back, his face white as paper.
Two or three men jumped out of the
tram and ran to the old man’s assistance.
Meanwhile a swift procession of cars
swept past, narrowly avoiding killing
them all. Yet it would have taken only
half a glance from the most urgent driver
to see that there had been an accident.
Apart from the risk of another one, com-
mon humanity should have made them
stop, or at least slow down. But there
was an unexpectedly clear stretch of road
ahead and, one after another, they all
accelerated, intent, no doubt, on Christmas
shopping and occupied with thoughts of
seasonal goodwill to all men.

“Melbn”: According to a recent
analysis, between 1933 and 1947 Mel-
bourne’s population has increased by
over a quarter of a million. The average
citizen, condemned to struggle for a place
in the double-decker bus and other instru-
ments of torture belonging to Mr. Bell's
transport system, drink at the city’s beer-
troughs, get a meal in the cafes and
cross an intersection wouldn’t have been
surprised if the figure had been a million.
At the same time rural population has
been as stationary as a wharfie holding up
Dutch shipping. The only increases in the
backbone of the State have been on the
Kiewa project and in areas where there is
intense irrigation. Though Mildura has
grown, there has been a big drop in the
Mallee owing to marginal wheatlands
being abandoned. Wimmera’s Horsham
has increased, but the district that feeds
it has diminished. Geelong, and Sale and
Bairnsdale, in Gippsland, have progressed
at a great rate because of the many im-
portant industries started, but the country
around them tells the same lean story.

“Pedestrian”: lam glad the new Aus-
tralian car costs over 700 quid. I have no
grudge against the working-man who
hoped to buy it for 200, but I can imagine
what the cities would be like if cars could
be bought at that price. Life wouldn’t
be worth living. As it is a man needs four
pairs of eyes and a lot of patience if he
wants to keep out of hospital. The higher
car prices go, the happier 4 —and safer —
I’ll feel.

“Unicorn”: Trust the old liftman to
hit the nail on the head. Working m
a building where a posh beauty-salon
operated, he sniffed and said, “Go in ’ags
and come out hangels.” He sniffed, too,
when a lass from a legal office tripped
lightly off one Friday to get married,
returning to work as usual on Monday.
“Married forty years too soon, that’s
what I was!” he said. “High cost of
living? Women didn’t bother about it
in my day. Left that to poor mugs like
me.” Maybe he was right at that!

“Bo”: Long a student of the fittings
of carriages on Sydney’s electric rail
system, I never cease to admire the
diabolical ingenuity with which the seats
are fitted so that they offer the maximum
resistance to the traveller who wishes to
reverse them. . Never in winter-time —
when they aren’t wanted —have I found
the wooden window-blinds to be in any-
thing but perfect working order; it is
only when the temperature creeps up
beyond 90 that they get stuck and won’t
come down. Another of the things that
make for a happy day is to fight for a
window-seat in a swelter and find that the
window has no catch and won’t stop up
unless you prop it with your elbow. The
onset of winter westerlies invariably
coincides with the appearance of doors
which, after being firmly shut, slide open
of their own volition, apparently a re-
sult of special research by the “backroom
boys” in the railway workshops. But I
struck a newie on a recent day when
Sydney was having its first rain for
several months. Shortly after I had closed
the window I noticed the rain splashing
through. Puzzled, I closed it again and
watched. Mysteriously the window Was
opening! Every time it was shut it
“The Wall-boards have arrived at last!"
slowly rose up to about two inches. An-
other triumph for the back-room boys,
with this successful reversal of Newton’s
Law.

“Becks”: I long ago gave up all hope
of ever hearing a new gag on the radio,
and I’ll say this for most radio comedians
that, judging by the way they lead the
laughs at their own jokes, they don’t really
expect listeners to accept them as original,
but rather invite their fans to join them
in chuckling at an old friend. None-
theless it still gets under my skin when
I hear someone passing off an old chest-
nut as his own brainchild, natural or
adoptive. I had a particularly bad
attack of prickly-heat last week when
twice in one night a Sydney station broad-
cast a record which it apparently intends
to make a hit number —a monologue
drawled by American comic Phil Harris.
It tells how, during the war, a detach-
ment of doughboys arrived at “a little
town called Casino” and were drafted
along to a church parade. Some of the
soldiers pulled prayer-books out of their
pockets, but one lad produced a pack of
cards. Called upon later to explain his
conduct he pleaded that the pack was at
once his Bible and his calendar. Follows
a long explanation, card by card, of how
he justified his statement. “And,” con-
cludes Phil Harris, “this is a true story.
I knew the boy.” The yarn, never very
funny, was current 30 years ago; it was
then told of an Aussie in England, but in
all probability it is almost as old as
playing-cards.

“F.S.”: In differentiating between
news and history “Findy” (B. 5/1/’49)
sidesteps the issue. I was trying to point
out that what those editors thought was
important in 1947 wasn’t important at
all, and time will not alter its unimport-
ance any more than time will alter the
quality of a picture. If somebody dis-
covered Rembrandt’s paintbox, that would
be news, and it would also be news if
some fashionable painter bought it for
£lOO,OOO, thinking it would help him to
paint like Rembrandt. “Fiftdy” says that
it would show a false sense of proportion
if a great fuss were made 100 years hence
over the discovery of one of Gandhi’s
loincloths. The loincloth would be im-
portant because of its association with a
great man, just as Phillip IV of Spain is
important because he sat for Velasquez.
But if a whole suit of clothes belonging
to President Truman were discovered in
2048 I doubt if anybody would regard it
as important.

“Uco”: It had been a good afternoon
for a mid-week round of golf—a bit hot
in the' sun, but the coolness of the beer
at the nineteenth compensated for that.
The Old Member seemed willing to stay
on and on ; his visitor was more inclined
to call it a day. “It’s all right for you,”
he said to the O.M, “Your wife’s away
in the country; mine’s expecting me
home to dinner.” Then a brainwave
struck him. “I’ll tell you what,” he said.
“Come home with me.” The O.M. shook
his head. “Can’t do that,” he said.
“Wouldn’t be fair to your missus.”
“That’s all right,” his guest told him.
“She won’t mind. There’ll be a- roast
dinner ; -plenty for all of us.” The O.M.
was still reluctant. He didn’t want to be
any trouble, he’d stay at the clubhouse;
sandwiches and beer would do him.
Still, persistence won in the end, and off
they went together. Despite his friend’s
reassurances, the O.M. felt a trifle appre-
hensive when he saw the look of con-
sternation on the little woman’s face as
she opened the door. The visitor still
maintains that he was right in the stand
he took in the domestic argument that
broke out when the O.M. had departed
shortly after a “dinner” of grated carrot,
shredded lettuce and milkless tea. How
was he to know that his wife had chosen
that day to put the household on Marilyn
Berle’s 13-day diet?

“Zake”: The Orient, I have ever heard,
is a strange and fascinating place, and
of all places in the Far East none appa-
rently is so strange and fascinating—
well, strange, at any rate —as Nanking.
“From the famous Purple Mountain,” I
am informed by a correspondent of a
daily on the spot, “Sun Yat-sen’s tomb
overlooks an extraordinarily calm, bust-
ling and thriving city.” Ah! Would
that I could be wafted from the hectic
bustling of Sydney to the calm bustling
of the Chinese Republic’s capital! To be
able to conduct one’s business with torpid
liveliness, to drift from bazaar to bazaar
hectically, to be able to rush somnolently
from pagoda to hash-house, to idle
furiously in a pedicab or lounge with
velocity in a coffee-shop —what pleasant
things one could do. I wonder not how
these things can be —I ascribe it all con-
fidently to that philosophy which has
for centuries characterised the Chinese,
and which we poor Occidentals could
never master.

“Gravelsnatcher”: That woman who
buried her waster husband in fine style
(B. 8/12/’4B) reminds me of a lady whose
husband’s death left her dry-eyed and
well-placed financially. An unlovable
character with a flair for making money,
he left more enemies than friends, and
he might have been forgotten early but
for the “In Memoriam” notices inserted
by his wife in the dailies. Occupying up
to half a column, they were an annual
feature until the lady herself passed on. It
transpired that the husband, a grim
humorist, had stipulated that his wife
should insert the notices, which should
be paid for by other beneficiaries. The
notices did much to sustain a long-
standing enmity.

“Muskeen”: That trapdoor in the
hansom-cab roof (B. 15/12/’4B) was a
source of embarrassment to loving
couples, although not nearly so revealing
as the rear-vision mirror of a taxi-cab.
Incidentally, one of Melbourne’s hansom-
cabs figured in a detective-story which
was one of the greatest successes in the
annals of detective fiction. It was Fergus
Hume’s Mystery of a Hansom Cab.

“Uramao”; As in the case of the sup-
posedly extinct bird the Notornis, which
waddled into mortal. ken recently after
50 years’ seclusion, Maoriland barmaids,
who, after 37 years, were believed to have
become as extinct as the moa, strutted
into the limelight when hotel-and-
restaurant workers were ventilating their
grievances the other day. At a stopwork
meeting four out of Auckland’s five
Hebes forsook the beer-handle to lend
the organisers their moral support. Ap-
parently Dunedin had no barmaids, or
perhaps they were the non-militant
variety. Christchurch mustered three ;
Wellington 15. Legislation passed in 1911
forbade the issue of beer-pump licences
to females, but those already licensed
were permitted to work out their con-
tracts. It was then .thought that a few
years would see the last of the species,
but, like old soldiers, they never die, and
seem to refuse even to fade away.

“Joe John”: Assuming “Pongo’s”
straw-decker (B. 24/11/’4B) was the
“donkey’s breakfast” I wore in the early
’twenties, he failed to touch on the lighter
side of its use. Snatched from another
boy’s head and thrown into the air like a
boomerang it afforded much sport to the
thrower. Another source of merriment
was to tilt the hat forward on to the
nose and then give the crown a thump. It
was advisable to do this to a smaller boy.
“Bohemian”: Prime Minister
Fraser (M.L.), according to a
cable, fell asleep in his chair at
U.N.O. I don’t blame him, but
I am reminded of an incident
back in the ’nineties, when
Prime Minister Seddon was
bringing in his Old Age Pen-
sions’ Bill. The Opposition
fought it tooth and nail, and one
night a loquacious member so
wearied the House, that one by
one members,- including Seddon,
left the Chamber. A quorum
being called for, a messenger
was sent to the P.M.’s private
room to bring him back. The
ringing of the bell over Seddon’s
head must have revived old
memories, for in response to a
deferential tap on the back he
exclaimed, without opening his
eyes: “Don’t give that rough
crowd in the parlor a new pack
of cards. And don’t give those two chaps
in the bar any more drinks on the nod.”
The great proconsul awoke to find that
he was no longer mine host of the
Kumara Miners’ Arms but Prime Minis-
ter of New Zealand.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Recent criticism of
the “blinking-owl” system of combating
the pigeon menace does not place the
innovation in its true light. In America
recently I saw the New York State Edu-
cation Building with its stuffed owls.
They worked well, and would be still
harassing the pigeons if more had been
erected. Several smaller buildings had
used the system successfully.

“Muskeen”: Tell “Matelot” (B.
22/12/’4B) that there was no such medal
as a Boer War Trooping Medal. The
Queen’s South African silver medal, with
or without appropriate clasps, was issued
to all military and naval personnel who
served in South Africa or were stationed
at St. Helena. A silver medal, identical,
except that “Mediterranean” appears on
the reverse in lieu of “South Africa,” was
issued to volunteer militia units who did
garrison duty at Gibraltar, Malta or in
Egypt. A bronze medal, similar to the
Queen’s silver South African medal, was
issued to all non-enlisted men, of what-
ever nationality, who drew military pay.
The King’s South African medal with two
clasps was issued to naval and military
personnel who were actually serving in
South Africa on January 1, 1902, and had
completed 18 months’ service in that coun-
try at that date or had completed the
same period of service by June 1, 1902.
“Matelot’s” friends probably received the
Queen’s bronze medal.

“Horseless Horseman”: Marble, said
to be second in quality only to the famed
Carrara-stone, is to be quarried in a big
way at Limestone Creek, 40 miles north-
east of Omeo in the rugged Victorian
highlands. The deposit has been known
for nearly 80 years, but interest in the
stone by a Melbourne masonry firm was
aroused only recently when masons,
geologists and others carried out an
extensive survey and found new moun-
tains of precious marbles extending for
16 miles in great unbroken cliffs. One
of the new marbles, when polished, de-
velops an exquisite beauty of gleaming
ivory-white, with hairlines of gold,
and this product has a high demand in
America. The irony of it: In 1907
Charles Summers, a Melbourne sculptor,
who had spent 34 years in Rome with his
father, a Royal Academician, changed his
smock and mallet for the drill and
hammer and went to Limestone Creek to
start a great marble industry. The first
stone, went to the Anglo-French Exposi-
tion, and for over four years he shipped
the slabs to London. But cartage 130
miles by bullock-teams to river steamers
at Mossiface and the going out of
fashion of marble mantelpieces and tables
forced Summers to abandon his quarry.
The new-found hillside of glistening
white missed his eye. It is just over the
ridge from where today stand his rusted
winch and scarred cliff-face.

“Si Anu”: No mention was made of
my old friend the Sultan of Jokjakarta
during the recent Dutch operations, and
I trust the urbane and cultivated gentle-
man hasn’t been liquidated along with
his opposite number, the Susuhunan of
Soerakarta, The Netherlanders main-
tained these two potentates in medieval
splendor and with comic-opera armies
for upwards of two centuries. Over against
each of them they established, as counter-
balances, a lesser potentate with a smaller
equipment of soldiers armed with lances.
Each sultan had his kraton with about
10,000 of his wives, children, aunts,
uncles, retainers and poor relations, and
on entering his gates one stepped back to
the days of ancient Java with the crafts-
men busy with their gold- and silver-
work and batik-making, as in the days of
the Dutch East India Company. They
were allies of the Dutch in the wars in
which the “Kompeni” consolidated its
conquests, and hence were early examples
of collaborators —fortunately for them,
on the right side. The Dutch wisely de-
cided to keep them as Convenient symbols
while depriving them of all material
power. As spiritual emblems* however,
they were always at the service of the
nationalist movement, which consider-
ably antedated the Jap invasion and the
Communist offensive.

“Anthrop”: Blunders committed by
missionaries in Polynesia (B. 1 /12/’48)?
The first church workers to arrive in the
Pacific were filled with horror at the
“heathen idols” they saw and insisted
that the natives burn them &s a sign of
conversion to Christianity. A few of
the objects were saved from the bonfires
and sent home to be exhibited be-
fore church congregations; dear old
ladies of both sexes shuddered at the
fearsome objects and dipped into their
purses to provide the dough to save the
heathen from worshipping graven images.
Anthropologists thank the missionaries

this destruction of ethnological treasures

Marsden was a practical man who com-
bined preaching and education with the

carved gateposts, ornamented house
gables and hei tiki neck ornaments for
what they were—the Maori equivalent
of our paintings, statuary and jewellery.

“Helldud”: As an old ’un, let me say
a word in defence of the modern young
man who “perms” his hair. He is prob-
ably no worse than the whisker-dandies
of my youth. Whiskers were trained,
trimmed and teased in a score of different
ways. There were the “neck to navel”
or full beard, “Dundreary,” “mutton-
chop,” “goatee,” “Prince Albert” and a
style, name unknown, which comprised
close-clipped moustaches plus a tuft be-
twixt nether lip and chin. Then there
was the vogue that framed the face from
ear to ear but left chin, lips and cheeks
bare. Those old-timers currycombed and
dandybrushed those face-draperies quite
as carefully and as often as did any damsel
her hair. But my vote for the most
original whisker-do went to an old cove
who not only wore his half-length beaver
parted in the middle, but also wore his
hair centre-parted from forehead to nape.
Wonderful things were done with
moustaches, too. They were flaunted in
lengths varying from six to 18 inches,
some waxed to needle-point ends, others
turned up and waxed. Then there was
the handlebar style, and the mo. plus
“Just poke out your tongue."

youth of today is probably not nearly
so hair-conscious as his great-grandad.

“F.S.”: In his Christmas service at
Wesley Church, Melbourne, Dr. Irving
Benson said that as far as officers of the
church knew nobody was hungry or
worried about money this Christmas. But
a lot of people were worried about beer,
many publicans, grown arrogant through
prosperity, having seen fit to close their
pubs down. Protests from embittered
would-be drinkers were met with the
usual excuse of lack of the essential
liquid. This didn’t apply to would-be
diners who found themselves shut out
from their Christmas dinner. Bung seems
to have forgotten that his title “publican”
has certain connotation, and that he
gets his licence on the assumption that he
provides a public service.
“Macnell”: Tell “Jaypey” (B. 5/1/’49)
that my eyewitness was on Vampire’s
bridge. He remembered not only the
salute —assuming that a low dive over
men helpless in the water could be con-
strued as little else —but the surely re-
markable fact that no attempt was made
to molest these men. But there will
always be diverging accounts of naval
battles. Among scores of attacking
planes, who can say definitely some did,
or did not, dip in salute? The stoker’s
account will differ from the oerlikon-
gunner’s—the former sees nothing, the
latter only his side’s view—and for this
reason I based my credence on the eye-
witness’s story of Admiral Layton’s
specific mention in his report to the
Admiralty of the immunity granted our
men by the Jap pilots. Repulse’s survivors
were 47 minutes in the water before her
consort went, ample time to receive the
Nips’ attention. I agree that Lieutenant
Vigors’s tribute was a siricere one, though
somewhat fulsome; I refrained from
quoting it because of the possible feeling
the mention of friendly fighters may have
engendered among survivors who saw
them arrive after the Japs had done their
stuff.

“Ascot”; “B. A. Ker” with his metal-
clip eyelets (B. 22/12/’4B) took us back
25 years. I can go back 75 years to the
origin of the things. They were patented
about that time by Haldenstein’s, a large
boot-factory of over 500 employees. My
uncle was a foreman there, and I was
10 years old. What impressed it on my
memory was my father’s disgust at getting
only £1 for the idea. The clips were not
intended for boots at all, but were de-
vised for huntsmen’s gaiters. A leg-iron
to keep a crippled boy’s foot straight was
taken to Pond’s of Castle Meadow,
Norwich (Eng.), for a gaiter to hold the
iron firm, and a metal clip in two parts
was made to take the place of eyelet-
holes. Pond’s patented the idea, and then
sold it to Haldenstein’s for £2O, of which
they gave my father £l. Haldenstein’s
soon had a machine for stamping clip
and eyelet in one. I ought to remember
it; I was the crippled boy, and the idea
probably saved my foot.
“R.A.A. Sargent”: Metal clips on
boot-tops are not so Jong extinct. As a
schoolboy I had them inflicted on me 18
years ago. After falling flat on my
face, as did “B. A. Ker” (B.
22/12/’4B), breaking my fingernails try-
ing to prise the damned things open,
poking a metal skewer through the broken
ones to enlarge the hole so the lace could
be threaded, and tying thousands of
knots when they cut the laces, it was with
a heartfelt sigh of relief that I discovered
on my transition from schoolboy to
jackeroo the neatness, ease and comfort
of that paragon of all boots, the “laugh-
ing-side.”

“Penny Post”: Stamp-collectors who
arrange with friends to place special
stamps on parcels and letters often find
that things arrive at the other end with-
out their postal-tax decorations, A
country postal official at a small office
recently explained where at least a few
went. “My boy has a great collection
of stamps,” he told me. “You see, a lot
of parcels come through, and whenever
I notice a stamp that seems any good
I tear the section off —looks as though it
might have been done through bad
packing, or torn accidental-like. You
can get ’em off letters, too, if there’s time.
Anyhow, I don’t suppose the people
they’re addressed to would want them —
they’d only be throwing them away!”
I’m wondering whether there’s anything
behind some envelopes I’ve seen lately
with “Stamp Lost in Transit” heavily
marked across the vacancy. Who is to
prove they were lost in transit?

■ “Ex-C.G.”: The first issue of The

amazement. The cartoons? The leading

Plain English, paragraphs, verses, short
stories and the rest? None of these —
though providing a good sixpennorth in
these expensive times —made me sit up
and stare. It was the last item on the
Sundry Shows page. Headed boldly “Is

the Public Trustee of Victoria was in
search of someone of that name. Never
in my born days have I seen a Govern-
ment or quasi-Government advertisement
couched in such language. If it means
that 1949 heralds a break from tradition
in these things on the lines suggested by
the advt. about Linda, then, indeed, may
1949 be a happy new year.

“M 8”: When the family party with
which I was picnicking at a Sydney
suburban beach park went to the water
I retired to some near-by shade and lay
down, hat over eyes, for a doze. But I
was disturbed. Two young wdmen came
to my side of the big tree, which was
the opposite side from the crowd. They
looked at me speculatively, then one said,
“Oh, it’s ail right, Tess. He’s a married
man; he’ll Understand.” With a con-
fidential smile at me Tess turned her
back, lifted her skirts high and held them
so, while her friend fiddled at her back
and swiftly removed a pink affair. Tess
dropped her dress, turned round with a
look of tremendous relief and said to
me, “Me girdle was too tight. Been
bustin’ to get rid of it all day.” Then
they departed. But did they really know
I am married or was that the feminine
way of putting me on my honor?
* * * *
“Clooter”: The new relationship be-
tween master and servant has penetrated
to our golf-club. The other day a player
hired a caddie and, as they set off, tried
to chat with him but was soon dis-
couraged by the caddie’s taciturnity. At
the third hole a low hill cuts off the
fairway, which veers beyond it so that a
cut or pulled ball may finish in low
scrub. As is the custom —or was —the
player told the caddie to go to the top
of the rise and watch the balls. The
caddie put the bag firmly on the ground
and delivered himself thus: “Look, I’m
paid t’ carry the bag. First y’ try to talk
t’ me, then y’ got me t’ hold the ruddy
flag, now y’ want me t’ go climbin’ moun-
tains watchin’ y’r balls. It’s no good
t’ me, mate. I’m paid t’ carry y’r bag,
see?” The four players eyed him in
silent astonishment; then one asked.
“Have you ever caddied before?” “No,”
he snapped, “an’ I don’t reckon I’ll come
at it again, neither. ’Slike a lot o’ other
jobs. People want y’ to do everythin’.
Bloke gimme ten bob on Sundee t’ wash
his car. Y’ orter heard him go butcher’s
’cos I didn’t dry it. Gripes, he said wash,
didn’t he! Whadda they think a man
is?” And, fuming with the injustice of
these things, he sat by the fee sullenly
waiting for them to hit off.
A CHESS CASUALTY.
“A player at the International Chess Congress at
Hastings, exasperated at losing a bishop, gnashed his
teeth so hard that lie broke a dental plate. The
game had to be adjourned to enable him to get his
injuries repaired.”— Cable.
No game, in Gordon’s view, was worth a rap
(Who hasn’t read the lines?) which didn’t
present
Some chance, however slender, of mishap,
Some possibility of accident.
Which covers all our pastimes more or less,
Including chess.
Some placid recreations, such as bowls,
From injuries you might pronounce immune.
Yet one has known enthusiastic souls
Worn out upon some sultry afternoon
Who’ve crumpled up and suddenly displayed
Need of first-aid.
He lost a bishop! Whether ’twas the queen
Or some marauding knight that dealt the
blow,
Using some strategy he’d not foreseen
And cotildn’t counter, we shall never know.
But nobody who reads can fail to note
It got his goat.
It made him furious. He couldn’t swear
Like golfers when they’ve missed a putt or
two,
Or hurl his tools of trade into the air,
As baffled tennis-players sometimes do.
Only—mute token of the storm beneath —
He gnashed his teeth.
He ground his molars, wishing that between
Upper and lower he could introduce
The aggravating knight or rook or queen
Which, so to speak, had cooked his bishop’s
goose,
Remembering they weren’t his own too late.
Snap went a plate!
Gently they led the victim from the field,
Whence to a dentist he might hit the breeze
And get his masticating outfit healed.
A proof that unexpected casualties
And queer mishaps may come to cause distress
Even at chess.

THE SERVICE MAN
Educating Whom?
“Ek Dum”: A State docu-
ment which was not published in
Australia, and which would
have added greatly to the gaiety
of the season if it had been, was
the Christmas message of Mr,
Cyril Chambers, Minister for
the Army, to Australian troops
in Japan. It was broadcast
twice —about 800 words of it.
And it was conceived in the true
Napoleonic spirit.
Mr. Chambers told the force
that the part it has played “has
been watched carefully and with
the approval of nations and
peoples of the world who fought
together for survival of de-
mocracy,” and he lauded our
“prowess in peace-time, equally
as in war, as a major Pacific
Power.”
He adjured the thin contin-
gent which has been left behind
—about enough for a battalion
group:
Having successfully concluded the
primary objectives which necessitated
your presence in Japan, you may
now devote more attention to the
intense problem involving the demo-
cratic education of the Japanese
people—at the same time not failing
to impress upon them with firmness
the folly of their aggressive way of
the past.
In your ability to cope with this
difficult assignment and to impress
upon the Japanese people our deter-
mination that they shall in years to
come embrace a peaceful outlook, we
have every confidence.
Mr. Chambers expressed his
“determination” to visit Japan
again very shortly.
The Army which Mr. Cham-
bers now rules in Australia can-
not provide a lieutenant-general’s
guard, much less impress any-
thing effectively on the Japanese
or anybody else. The national
impression on Japan which has
been made by all our effort was
shown by Dr. Peter Russo,
formerly lecturer in modern
languages at Tokyo University,
who wrote recently in the
official organ of the Occupation
Force, after he had used his ex-
tensive knowledge of Japan and
Japanese language to survey the
position;
You are extremely proud of tha
snappy guard change the Australians
carry out in Tokyo. • If so, prepare
for a nasty shock. The believe-it-
or-not feature is the number of
Japanese who positively did not know
the guard was Australian. They
thought it came from a crack Ameri-
can regiment, especially trained and
equipped for precision work of this
kind.
Yet the 8.C.0.F. Command
in Japan is convinced that it has
its ear to the ground and knows
exactly what the reactions of
the Japanese are and how im-
mense has been the result of
the Australian occupation in
teaching the Japanese where
they get off and educating them
along the lines which Mr.
Chambers intends to pursue,
“The democratic education” of
the Japanese people, now
80,000,000 strong, by a weakly-
armed battalion group and one
R.A.A.F. squadron at peace-
time strength tucked away in a
remote corner of Honshu, seems
rather an ambitious task.
On the results which are
actual and not merely claims it
would be wise to pay a little
attention to the viewpoint of Dr.
Russo upon Japan—he and the
writer were there at the same
time, though not in contact until
the end of their visits:
My first wonder has been that there
are so many people left in Japan who
look exactly like Japanese but don’t
behave like it.
. Certainly their bearing and utter-
ances no longer proclaim, as they
once did, however politely, that the
Creation was purely a Japanese idea
and lesser mortals should never cease
to be grateful for it.
lf it puzzles the old-timers,
even those who made a professional
study of the pre-war species, what
chance has the foreign newcomer who
is not equipped with this compara-
tive gauge?
Timidly I suggest that some of the
answers may lie in the cult of that
peculiarly Japanese art of self-defence
known as judo. It is a cult which
pervades the mental as well as physical
reactions of the Japanese. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, he has the
knack of knowing how to utilise
someone else’s superior strength or
knowledge to help himself.
It is not necessarily a vicious
quality, but, for the Westerner, it is
an oblique and unfamiliar approach
which should be understood. You
overcome the opposition of a Japanese
and push him along triumphantly.
When you’re well down the course
you discover that somehow you’ve
been pushing him precisely in the
direction he wants to go.
This seems to put the matter in
a nutshell. It would take a lot
of conceit to believe that the
emissaries of Mr. Chambers
have a chance of educating the
Japanese, especially in de-
mocracy.
The impression the , writer
formed from the general readi-
ness to take the Jap at his face
value was that the Japanese
might be educating us.
The Sea and Air-power.
“Ek Bum”: In the light of
history the statistics of the
Pacific Ocean War make remark-
able and instructive reading.
The naval effort in the Pacific
was larger in terms of sea ton-
“I think he WILL be all right , Prendergast; he
used to drive a double-decker bus.”
nage-mileage than the Atlantic
war, having regard to time. The
weight of naval ships was much
larger than in the Atlantic war.
But the main interest lies in the
air war and its relation to naval
warfare,
In the Pacific the fronts were
almost entirely natural naval
fronts. There was no way in
which the large quantities of
men and material could be
brought to assault points save
by sea, this because of the
limited carrying- and range-
capacity of aircraft. But every
attempt was made to minimise
the naval element.
The Sea Problem
j n a war j n Eastern Asia

P erha P s a lesser degree be-
cause °f tkie l ar S er range of air-
cra ft and the existence of Ameri-
can . b ases in the fringes of the
tactical area. The Pacific prob-
lem is much like that which
exists in Europe today. In both
areas the potential enemy has
direct and reasonably short land
communication-lines with his
bases of production, while the
bulk of the Western Allies’ re-
sources must, under present cir-
cumstances, come from over-
seas as must a great proportion
°f the ''oops. This will be
truer in Europe than last tune,
since France is weak in
secondary resources.
The which Russia
has in this matter is offset, how-
ever, to a large extent by the
poorness of her land communi-
cations wretched railways
snaking over long distances, dirt
roads or no roads at all and a
tremendous shortage of motor
vehicles and rolling-stock in re-
lation to her problems.
Russia’s basic strength in a
land war would depend largely
on whether she could overrun
Germany and France in the first
rush and then have sufficient
breathing space and procure
sufficient skill to apply German
and French industry to the war
effort, at the same time knock-
ing out England and either over-
running it or making it unten-
able and securing air control
over the main Atlantic sea-
routes. Apart from this, she
would need to secure control of
the Mediterranean and Persia
and the African and Indian ap-
proaches. These latter are vitally
important because the Russian
bloc has its “soft underbelly”
—in fact, two soft underbellies,
one on each side of Suez,
Russia’s approach to these
problems is one of land and air.
But the Western Allies’ one is of
the sea and air, and it cannot
have any but a sea approach.
This makes the talk of some
Australian Ministers who de-
clare carelessly that the day of
the Navy is done stupid and
wanton.
Long-distance Approach
The logistic requirements of
war and the defence of sea com-
munications in war are merely
a magnification of those of
peace. The forms may change
-—the submarine may become the
main offensive weapon, the role
of aircraft in the carriage of
manpower, particularly over
short distances, may be magni-
fied, but the time has not yet
come, and will not come for a
number of years, when it will
be possible for long-distance
weapons alone to fight for Mr.
Chifley over 3000 miles or when
the great bulk of the material
for a war can be carried to the
really relevant positions by air
or guarded exclusively by air-
craft.
With all the herculean effort
of the Pacific War the bombing
tells the story. Of a total of
656,000 tons dropped—about
three-fifths of the quantity
dropped on Europe alone in the
European war by the Western
Allies—just on 500,000 tons was
dropped in breaking a way
trough the limited numbers of
fighting divisions far-flung for
thousands of miles from the
Japanese main islands and the
huge numbers of camp-followers,
ancillaries and communication
troops,
Bombs on Japan
The dropping of that 500,000
tons of bombs—plus other
forms of war—made it possible
to approach and drop 160,000
tons on the home islands of
Japan. Of this quantity 147,000
tons was dropped by the 8295,
and the naval logistics of that
operation are, in American par-
lance, “just nobody’s business.”
Of the 147,000 tons, more than
104,000 tons was dropped in
15,000 sorties on 66 Japanese

NAME (in BLOCK LETTERS) ...
ADDRESS •
cities, and 169 square miles was
burnt out. This was only
rendered possible because of the
utter weakness of Japanese ack-
ack defence in many areas and
the flimsy nature of Japanese
buildings. It represented, in
terms of bombs, about two
months’ .operations towards the
end of the war on the European
front at a time when Germany
had already stood up to nearly
1,000,000 tons of bombs —and
was still standing up.
The only month in which U.S.
Air Force bombing came near a
European standard of bulk was
the last of the war, when 42,000
tons was dropped.
Distance and Load
The influence of distance was
evident from the stepping-up of
the loads of the 829 s as they
approached Japan. In Novem-
ber, 1944, operating from the
Marianas area, the huge air-
craft were delivering an aver-
age load of 2.9 tons —as noted
here at the time, they could
not possibly carry the 10
tons with which the daily papers
universally credited them. In
July, 1945, the average load,
over distances comparable to
bombing distances in Europe,
was 7.6 tons. The machines
v/ere still carrying slightly less
th#n the average load of the
British Lancasters, distance for
distance, despite their huge size
and cost.
Cost naturally enters into the
matter. The first 829 cost over
£1,000,000 sterling, and every
new large prototype calls for a
relatively larger amount. Thus
most prototypes cost half as
much as a light aircraft-carrier,
at least in these days, what with
rising costs and other influences.
In bulk production the 829
cost about £200,000 and called
for nearly 60,000 man-hours of
labor.
To keep 1000 829 s in the air
—ships which over a range of
1500 miles would be able to de-
liver a regular 2900 tons of
bombs at one loading—would
need 4000 machines costing
£800,000,000. Though there are
now much larger and longer-
ranging machines, such as the
836, which is reputed to be able
to carry 10 tons of bombs
10,000 miles —its data suggest
that this is a considerable exag-
geration—load-increase makes
for substantial cost-increase. The
prototype of the English com-
mercial Brabazon cost more than
the 28,000-ton Orcades. And
costs have gone up considerably
since the figures quoted above
were valid.
Even millionaire countries
have to consider resources in
their present condition.
It is obvious that in spite of
the enthusiasm of Air Forces
and the apparent triumph of the
Air Secretary over the Navy in
the battle of defence methods
which has been going on in the
United States, the day of navies
and of sea-carriage is far from
done.
Naval Costs
In terms of cost, naval ap-
proach to the problem of heavy
bombing is the most economi-
cal. Forward bases, calling for
millions of tons of material, can
only be serviced by ships. At
present prices 200 28,000-ton
Orient liners of the type of
Orcades can be built for the
price (pre-1945) necessary to
provide machines to keep 829 s
sufficient to carry a 2900-ton
load regularly over 1500 miles
in the air.
Of course, the load can be
carried by air more cheaply over
the preliminary stages than over
the actual bombing stage, but
the cost of cargo-aircraft provi-
sion, beside ship provision, is
still pretty staggering.
Also, in “in-fighting,” there is
no doubt about the economy of
ship approach even when it is
conceived on the most lavish
scale.
The new 65,000-ton carriers,
of which the first is on the stocks
at Newport News for the U.S.
Navy, are to cost about
£40,000,000 Australian. Twenty
of these with a capacity of 840
829 s would cost a little more
than the 4000 829 s which would
be needed to keep 1000 in the
air.
With their powerful defences,
high speed and other qualities
these ships could approach a hos-
tile coast much more closely,
under proper cover, at an early
stage in a campaign than any
purely airborne organisation.
And the closer The approach the
more effective is each 829. One
829 at 500 miles is worth three
at 1500 miles even in terms of
pure load.
All the elements of wear and
tear, shortening of time-risk and
availability for new strikes must
be taken into consideration,
Japan’s Mistake
It is certain that shipping will
play an even bigger part in the
next war than the last. Japan
cannot be taken as an example
of war-winning by the air. The
actual winning was done by the
Japanese, who made the grave
mistake of too widely extending
their communication-lines.
They wasted their immense
potentiality in doing this,*leav-
ing huge numbers of troops out
on limbs, being at the same time
incapable of arming, feeding gnd
munitioning them and protecting
their communication-lines.
The rest of their effort they
wasted in defending their far-
flung legions.
They sacrificed defence of the
source of their military supplies
and manpower to the wide-flung
adventures of the South Seas,
with the result that, when they
were faced with the real test,
they were without the resources
in petrol, arms, ack-ack and air-
shelter to defeat it.
When this page went to press
a serious situation had de-
veloped through the shooting-
down of five R.A.F. aircraft
over Egypt, in their own zone,
in which they had a perfect
right to be. All R.A.F. stations
in the Middle Eastern area have
been placed on a war footing
and pilots have been ordered to
shoot down any Israeli aircraft
found over Transjordan or
Egyptian territory. According
to the Israeli spokesman, the
R.A.F. pilots said they were,
specifically instructed not to use
their guns. They were, therefore,
sitting shots. They were told
that if hit they must bale out.
Apart from R.A.F. action, the
R.N, is being put on active
basis at Malta and a British
force is being sent to Akaba, in
Transjordania, T. E. Law-
rence’s old key town, to protect
it from Jewish invasion. All the
Jewish actions are illegal under
U.N.O. rulings and orders.
Their incursions into Arab terri-
tory right outside army zone,
the possession of which can pos-
sibly be in dispute, is about as
sheer and naked a piece of
aggression as could be imagined.
It threatens an important Aus-
tralian communication line. But
what has Dr. Evatt got to say
about it?

among the 28 boys recently accepted into
the R.A.N. College as cadet-midshipmen.
Anthony Dowling is the nipper of
Captain Roy Dowling, who, in cruiser
Hobart at the finish, now commands our
carrier Sydney ; Reginald Gatacre belongs
to Captain G. G. O. Gatacre, now
Deputy-Chief of Naval Staff, who drove
destroyer Arunta in the Japanese fight;
and Philip Brook is the saltwater edition
of a Royal Navy man, Lt.-Cdr. A. Brook,
also at Navy Office.
Art got its only look-in in the New
Year honors with Professor Bernard
Heinze’s knighthood. Born at Shep-
parton in 1894, he studied in London,
Berlin and Paris under distinguished
teachers, was a gunner in the First
World War and subsequently con-
ducted J.C.W. orchestras, where, if a
piece had a long run, a score by Bach
was, as often as not, on the conductor’s
stand while he directed the orchestra
through some well-known ditty. Since
1926 he has been Ormond Professor of
Music at Melbourne Uni', and has prob-
ably done more for organised music
than any other Australian. He founded
the Melbourne String Quartet, has
directed the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra since 1933, began creation of
the next generation of audiences for pub-
lic music with his children’s concerts, and
is musical adviser to the A.B.C. He has
been guest conductor in places abroad,
and in Finland Sibelius congratulated
him on his direction of one of that com-
poser’s own symphonies.
It’s a pity Malcolm Campbell didn’t do
some driving round Australian cities—his
example would have benefited the Road
Safety Council more than all their advts.
Off the course he seemed never to be in
a hurry, and to drive with him on an open
road would have been a lesson to flash
youngsters who consider 40 m.p.b. slow
He took his time and no chances —the
reason,- probably, why he died in bed at
63. He was a public-school boy, spoke
French and German well, was in Lloyd’s
for 10 years before the Kaiser’s war.
began motor-racing in 1910, flying the
year before, and flew with the R.F.C.
His long, slabby figure and kindly,
aquiline face usually wreathed in a grin
were as British-made as the giant cars
he flung to record after record down their
sandy courses.
Turned 66, Frank Hills, of Yeerongpilly
(Q.), has resigned his 29-years wardership
at Boggo-road jail. He likens his
boarders to Army recruits in their diffi-
culty in adjusting themselves to their
unusual surroundings. But, unlike the
troops, they can’t stomach harsh or irritat-
ing language. Hills was in the Boer War
before he had a vote, and was a sergeant
in the old Ninth Battalion in the next with
Premier Hanlon and Queensland Police
Commissioner Carroll.
Some January literary anniversaries:
On New Year’s Day, 1803, Richard Hengist
Home, poet and prose-writer, friend of Marcus
Clarke, was born; on the 2nd, Henry Kingsley
(Geoffrey Hctmlyn ) made his appearance in
1830, and 36 years later eminent Greek scholar
Gilbert Murray was born. Also bn the 2nd,
Edward E. Morris, whose Austral English is
an excellent dictionary of Australian words
and phrases, died in 1902. On the 4th in
1869, R. H. Croll ( Wide Horizons, Wanderings
in Central Australia and other travel books)
made his debut in this world. Gordon Thomas
{Tropic Equations ) was born on the sth in
1890. Born 99 years ago on the 7th, poet
Robert Richardson; also on the 7th novelist
Jean Devanny {The Butcher’s Shop). Died in
Sydney on the Bth in 1904, poet John Farrell,
who was once a brewer and an ardent single-
tax advocate. Public servant and poet, John
Rae took his first breath on the 9th in 1813.
Editor of The Bulletin from 1915 to 1933,
S. H. Prior was born on the P’th in 1869,
and Vivian Crockett {Messalina and Mezzo-
morto) was ushered into the world in 1893 on
the 11th. Author of Station Hunting on the
Warrego, poet P. J. Holdsworth was born on
the 12th 100 years ago and died 51 years later
on the 19th; also on the 12th Dorothy Wall,
writer of children’s books, was born. On the
13th in 1913 Lawson Glassop {We Were the
Rats) first exercised his lungs. In 1856 on the
14th John Feltham Archibald (founder, with
John Haynes, and first editor of The Bulletin)
was born. Poet Rex Ingamells, general editor
of the Jindyworobak publications, was born
on the 19th in 1913. First Australian-born poet
to achieve any importance, Charles Harpur was
born 132 years ago on the 23rd. Ethel Turner
(Mrs. H. R. Curlewis), author of Seven Little
Australians, has January 24 for her birthday.
Stanley Vere Toose, appointed a N. S.
Wales Supreme Court Judge in Divorce
for the first half of 1949, was born on
•the Macleay River, and as a youth
worked in the Sheriff’s Office. He was
admitted to the bar in 1912, but remained
in the civil service (for a period acting
as associate to Gordon, J.) until 1919,
wheh he began practice as a barrister,
eventually Specialising in divorce. The
Tooses (with variations of the name)
originate from Somerset or thereabouts;
and Toose, J.; still likes to rusticate
(when he has the time) on a property on
the Macleay. A particularly keen golfer,
for years he was president of Roseville
Golf Club.
Rugby, the home of a celebrated brand
of football and of Thomas Arnold, has
an ex-headmaster in Melbourne. He is
P. H. B. Lyon, an old boy who assumed
the chief mortarboard at 37 while many of
his former teachers were still wielding the
ferrule. He won the Newdigate Prize
with a poem on his sojourn in a German
concentration camp as a wounded
prisoner, and believes that education
should be founded on poetry and the
classics. Now in retirement at 55, he is
here to address the Council of Adult
Education summer school at Wesley, Mel-
bourne.
An Englishman, Lord Barnby, is to be
one of the Australian Wool Board’s reps
on the International Wool Secretariat.
What he doesn’t know about the stuff
wouldn’t take long to write. Recalled
from Gallipoli to the assistant director-
ship of clothing stores in England, he be-
came controller of wool supplies in 1916,
and was responsible for the purchase and
distribution of British and Dominion
wool clips. And he represented South
Bradford, the great milling area, in the
Commons from 1918 to 1922. The
I.W.S. is one of his particular babies—
he was among the first to advocate its
inception when he came here in 1935.
Prior’s attached victim is Alderman E.
C. O’Dea, M.L.C., and long a Labor
civic councillor, Sydney’s new prime
inhabitant. Father of the House in the
city’s Trades Hall, by virtue of years of
service, he has been returned unopposed
for secretaryship of the State Shop
Assistants’ Union for 30 years. In
one way or another this latter func-
tion could be said to have con-
tributed materially to the city’s well-
being—a promising augury. A house-
wife-shopper, pleased with her counter
service, passes on her beatification to her
husband, the kids benefit in turn, and so
on, all this beginning with happier and
more obliging counter-jumpers—he has
got their screws up to £8 4s. a week, some
females of the species benefiting
HIS WORSHIP.
to the same tune. But though his
Worship depreciates what he’s done for
the city’s shop assistants, and what he
intends to do for its other million or so
dwellers, on one thing he has no qualms
about claiming distinction —he is a great
patron of sport, and indulges in it at
Harold Park and Randwick whenever
Mayoral matters, now added to his
union’s, permit him to.
This court item from Coventry reveals
the frank and pleasant countenance of
George Coutts Ligertwood, the S.A.
Judge who will conduct the N.G. timber-
case inquiry. It’s not the first big issue
in which he’s been involved. In 1942
he opened the uniform-tax-law fight be-
tween the Commonwealth and the States,
declaiming for S.A. with that same per-
suasive vehemence which, as a Bulletin
man recorded of him over a decade ago,
HIS HONOR.
“seemed to impart itself even to his wig
and gown.” He spoke then for more
than 10 hours. Concerned also in the
Gordon Bennett-Singapore inquiry, the
Judge was born in S.A., took his LL.B.
from Adelaide Uni. in 1910, and began
practising at the State’s bar in 1920,
taking silk 10 years later. He was for
three years Acting Master of S.A.
Supreme Court, took time off from his
legal duties to serve with the A.1.F., and
was appointed Judge in 1945.
Melbourne is as sensitive to praise as
to blame—a susceptibility which no doubt
caused a classic printing error in the
make-up of a recent Melb. “Herald.”
Professor Denis Winston, described as a
distinguished English town-planning ex-
pert, who is on his way to keep the dust
off the seat of a Chair on the subject
at Sydney Uni., struck a “Herald” re-
porter and let himself go to some order.
About the city everything was perfect,
even the little streets which incur so many
citizens’ curses. The gardens, the birds,
the city’s architecture, the high hedges of
Toorak, the lesser suburbs without them,
the home gardens, and especially the
Yarra —all were perfection. Not one
note of adverse criticism could be
squeezed from the charmer. The intoxi-
cation of all this must have stunned the
“Herald,” because it not only printed
Professor Winston’s two-column pane-
gyric on its leader page but repeated it
on the next one. The professor was
previously town-planner to Southampton.
Still going strong at Narrabri (N.S.W.),
solicitor John McDonald was admitted
in March, 1881. It must just about make
him the senior practitioner in the senior
State.
“Diam”; Enter Sam Fripp, business-
man of Melbourne, for the unusual-hobby
comp. He is a voluntary beach cleaner-
upper and is always open for seasonal
engagement. Last summer he spent five
days rewhitening Brighton’s strand and
removed three tons of broken bottles,
hair-combs and sardine-tins from the St.
Kilda strip. Company equipment in-
cludes a dozen rakes, 18 buckets, a dozen
shovels, eight 44gal. and 15 large
and small sieves. His brand of
public-spiritedness, folio wing
after public incivism, deserved
a mention in the New Year
honors.
Desmond Randall, of Launceston, is
the proud possessor of a kitbag which
has seen more of the world than he has.
After World War I it was bought out of
surplus stores by his father and humped
to the Wembley Empire Jamboree in
1924, the Swiss Jamboree of 1927 and the
1929 Liverpool occasion. In between it
toured the U.K. and Europe and later
was inherited by Desmond’s sister, a
Girl Guide. Its present owner was leader
of the Apple Island contingent at the
Wonga Park frenzy.
Among the R.A.N.’s old hands—there
are few enough of them today—there is
probably only one who can claim to have
served in all three Sydneys. He’s Com-
missioned Writer Bert Burley, of Sans
Souci, Sydney, who first tasted salt water
in the original Sydney in 1920.. In
Musso’s war he was aboard her 6in.
successor when Rear-Admiral John
Collins caught the Bartolomeo Colleoni,
and now he’s waiting at Devonport to
sail home in our new carrier, the third
of the name.
Clyde Fenton, in the news for flying
through a N.T. aerodrome regulation, has
never been noted for being usual. Answer-
ing to Sammy at Melbourne Uni., where
he took science before tackling the subject
which landed him in his present job, he
puzzled fellow-students by his unorthodox
study methods. He breakfasted at 6 p.m.,
worked all night, had dinner and went to
bed until it was time for him to do the
coaching which paid his medical fees.
Fenton’s career as a flying-doctor has
been an almost continuous record of ad-
ventures met and difficulties overcome, so
flying through an official regulation
shouldn’t worry him unduly.
Lord Dugan, a New Year’s honors
beneficiary, has been 15 years in Aus-
tralia, first as vS. Australia’s Governor,
and, since 1939, Victoria’s. He was twice'
Acting G.-G. His military experience
began with enlistment as an Irish private
in the British Army at 19. He enlarged it
against President Kruger, and in the next
scrap was colonel of an Irish regiment in
France, with a brigadier-generalship to
follow. Between wars he had territorial
commands in England, in one of which
he caused something of a sensation
in Army circles. Dissatisfied with his
command’s peace-time discipline, he de-
cided to stiffen it with a practical lesson.
A parade was ordered, but Dugan’s in-
spection had no sooner begun than a
dilapidated Ford jolted at speed through
the gates past the confounded sentries
and came to a stop alongside him. Three
whiskered figures leapt out, grabbed the
colonel, dumped him into the car and
tore off again while the regiment stood
paralysed at the theft of their commander.
After the hullabaloo, with the lesson
very much alive, it was' 1 revealed that the
bandits were his own officers rigged up
as Bolshies.
The death of the Rev. Father John
Glover, flying priest of New Guinea, is
particularly mourned in Albury, wfiere
his family owns the Royal Hotel. One
of the first Albury boys to be trained as
a priest in the town, he studied flying as
well as holy orders, and later, when an
islands missionary, acting on the well-
known dictum on the advisability of
passing the ammunition as well, he
trained as an* infantryman in the N-.G.
Volunteers. His training came in useful
when he organised the rescue of 90 nuns
and missionaries from behind Jap lines
in 1942. Later he joined the A.I.F. as
chaplain, and was back sky-piloting in
New Guinea, literally and spiritually,
at the end.
Into the silence:
At 79, at Frankston (Vic.), Major-General
Harold William Grimwade, who commanded
the 4th F.A. Brigade, 3rd Division Artillery,
in the 1914 war. He was mentioned four
times in dispatches and gained the C. 8.,
C.M.G., and Croix de Guerre. Chairman of
directors of the chemical firm of Felton, Grim-
wade and Duerdins, and a director of Aus-
tralian Glass, he was a member of the Felton
Bequest committee formed to implement the
art bequest of his former partner, Alfred
Felton.
At Auckland (M.L.), at 83, Colonel George
Thompson Hall, C.M.G., C.8.E., who served
with the N.Z. Army Service Corps as camp
commandant and was later chief of staff in
Egypt during the First World War.
In Sydney, Dr. Annie Praed, veteran den-
tist and claimed to be one of the first
Bachelors of Dental Surgery and the first
Doctor of Dental Surgery to graduate from
Sydney University, in 1908. In the first war
she went to America as Australian delegate
at the U.S. Dental Conference, and in the
second was particularly mindful of dehtists on
active service through her presidency of the
Dental Comforts Fund. In recognition of the
sustained standard of her work Sydney Uni-
versity authorities established the Dr. Praed
prize for Operative Dentistry.
In Melbourne, at 61, Cyril William Kinsman,
0.8. E., for 18 years past Clerk of the Vic-
torian’Executive Council. He had been official
secretary to the State Governor, which almost
means Lord Dugan, since 1930. He
served with the 22nd Battalion and the 2nd
Division Gas Service during the 1914 war.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
“Strange disappearance of noted scientist.
Dr. Faustus, eminent author of Hormones
and Wolf Calls, Over to Youth, etc., has
not been seen since three months ago when,
before locking himself in his study, he told
his man-servant to bring him his morning
tea at six-thirty the following morning.
Since then this faithful servant has each
morning set a cup of tea outside his
master’s study. But this morning, having
exhausted the supply of cups, and the pas-
sage outside the doctor’s study being com-
pletely blocked by the crockery, the servant
sought the aid of the Burgomaster ”
The Girl in the Flat Opposite thinks that
even if medieval times lacked the ameni-
ties of the daily and Sunday press, the
town-criers might have got busy on the
mystery. Apparently it passed unnoticed
until Goethe took it up in a poetic way.
And that’s a good job, because instead
of a crime we have an opera.
Very colorful, too, the story proved
in its unfolding at the Tivoli last Satur-
day night, when everybody succumbed
to the devil from the moment of his entry
in his full, swinging and golden flame
cloak. The dancing and commotion of
the Kermesse scene, the blithe note in the
frocks and hats worn by the young
girls formed the one interlude in the
dolors of the night, and the audience
applauded them vigorously. The only
bright spots in Marguerite’s attire were
the jewels (an anthracite by-product, no
doubt) supplied by Mephisto. As usual,
absorbed in the production, sat first-
nighter soprano Constance Pickworth,
whose own fluent notes bear the polish
of France and Italy. Other regular first-
nighters were Matron Goodwin and
Gladys Hartt. Admired were Mrs. Pierre
Mann’s black laces and the Ben Fuller
lady’s cape of pink ostrich feather.
Admired, too, was Australian girl Wilma
Whitney, who was the nurse Martha.
Victoria Barracks will soon be left
lamenting the departure of the popular
Colonel and Mrs. Mann. He goes down
to Melbourne and up in military rank
next week. They were fareweffed last
Saturday at a cocktail-party given by
Colonel Spain and daughter Mrs. Russell
in Colonel Spain’s home, which overlooks
the harbor from the top of Kurraba steps.
This sparkled along from six onwards.
Mrs. Mann’s frock of soft black crepe
had a deep yoke of ivory Carrickmacross
lace, and her hat was a tiny scrap of
white satin straw in which a rosebud
or two was caught. Mrs. Russell’s
young sons helped in entertaining. Colonel
Spain, as usual, was a genial and all-
seeing host. The guests were almost all
of the military. Mrs. Alan Foott, who
is Mrs. Mann’s great friend, was there
with her Colonel husband.
Former pupils all over the State will
regret the sudden death of long-estab-
lished singing-teacher William Asprey.
By a strange coincidence, a pupil recalls
“Boheme” was the last opera seen by
Mr. Asprey. He had been deputy-
director and had trained the choruses for
that opera’s first production in Sydney.
Later, in Italy, Puccini complimented the
Australian on the fine work he had done,
news of which had been brought to the
composer by returning artists. Mr.
Asprey had been a former choirmaster
at St. Mary’s. *
The Lord and Lady Mayoress received
last Tuesday Dutchwoman Fanny
Blankers-Koen, the world’s wonder
woman runner. In spite of her glitter of
Olympic honors, Mrs. Blankers-Koen —
husband Jan Blankers is making the tour
with her —has a modest air and a gentle
voice. She is reported, also, to have , all
the housewifely arts at her finger-tips.
She is blonde.
Sydney pianists went along to the
Castlereagh-room of the Australia last
Monday to greet Walter Landauer and
Maryon Rawicz, the duo-pianists now
visiting Australia under A.B.C. direction,
also Mrs. Rawicz and Mrs. Landauer,
who have made friends with our surf and
beaches, and look pleased generally with
the Australian scene. Their two husbands
will give their first concert in the Town
Hall on January 29.
Ngaio Marsh, 0.8. E., and 40 members
of the Canterbury Students’ Company,
now opening a season at the Con., called
on Lord Mayor O’Dea and the Lady
Mayoress last Monday afternoon. They
were received in the Lady Mayoress’s
drawing-room, and D. D. O’Connor, who
is shepherding.the venture, came over in
time for the party from Perth, where he
has been farewelling the Ballet Rambert.
Ngaio has been given the distinction of
being appointed hon. lecturer in drama
to Canterbury University College in
Christchurch.
Another of Monday afternoon’s parties
was that given by the Arts Council of
Australia to Mr. Nevin Tait, conductor
Ghione and the members of the William-
son Grand Opera Company, Sherry in
the board-room of the Rural Bank at
4.30 p.m.
That fapade, not fashion, is what a
woman should consider when buying a
hat or having one made for her is the
gospel of Hugh Beresford, who makes the
Queen’s hats. In other words, a woman
should be realistic with herself about her
hair, and features and the length of her
neck before plucking fascinating bloom-
ings in the millinery salon. He also
agreed that to be a really successful
wearer of hats a woman must have some-
thing of the actress in her. She must live
up to the mood of her hat. He also gave
an example of a London lady who,
conscious of her slender figure and masses
of lovely hair, always wears the same
type of headgear, and it a trifle that rests
on the hair rather than on the head. Per-
sonally, that sounds a bit Gothic to me.
Because of his very greatness in his art
he is not afraid to own that a cheap copy
of a model may yet be a very good hat,
and murmured some verse about a woman
who saw her dream hat in a West-End
shop-window. She goes in, she tries it on.
It is perfect. She asks the price—£ls.
Her hopes are shattered. All the way
home to her provincial town she sighs for
its perfections. Then, as she walks down
the High-street, she sees her hat (a copy,
of course) in a window: “At 295, 9d. —the
price that made it mine!” He also told
that the Queen’s favorite color in hats is
blue, andf that she wears feathers because
she really likes them. That was interest-
ing. This Letter had thought it might be
because the ostrich is a bird of Empire.
Mr. Beresford is tall and slim, and has
a resemblance to Thorley Walters, leading
man with the Cicely Courtneidge com-
pany. To his cocktail-party in the Castle-
reagh-room of the Australia last week all
the women wore their smartest hats. With
great tact he murmured his appreciation
to each wearer. Then two guests euchred
him. They arrived hatless! At this party
were Adelaide’s Lord Mayor McLeay
and his attractive little wife. With them
was Mrs. McLeay’s sister, Mrs, E. A.
Head, whose husband is managing-
director of Paterson, Laing and Bruce,
through which firm Mr. Beresford is mak-
ing his Australian tour,
Mrs. E. C. O’Dea, Sydney’s new Lady
Mayoress, looks serenely out from this
Sidney Riley photograph. Her first re-
ceptions as civic hostess will be on
Wednesday, January 19, and Thursday,
January 20, when she will receive callers
between the hours of 11 and 12 noon.
Dr. Edgar Booth has just returned
from his travels—loo,ooo miles on the
sheep’s back. Dr. Booth, who went away
as World Wool Ambassador and is Over-
seas Representative of the Australian
Wool Board, has just recently resigned
from the chairmanship of the International
Wool Secretariat. With Mrs. Booth he
returned in the Athenic last week and
has an absorbing yarn to spin about wool.
The world wants Australia’s wool and
the great fashion designers are enthusi-
astic about it. And this doctor can tell
because he is a vice-president of the In-
corporated Society of London Fashion
Designers, of which Norman Hartnell is
president. Latest evolution of wool is
the alginate lace, ideal for everything
from undies to evening frocks. Inci-
dentally, to Mrs. Toby Brown, of Bina-
long, goes honorable mention for
popularising the evening frock of wool
at least 12 years ago. Dr. and Mrs. Booth
and daughter Nancy, who met them at
the ship, are now holidaying in Bowral.
Their son Brian is doing an honors
course in Textile Science at Leeds Uni-
versity.
U.K. High Commissioner E. J.
Williams, Mrs'. Williams and daughter Ivy
returned in the Athenic after six months’
visit to England and Wales. Mrs. Wil-
liams, who kept house for a few weeks
at her old home in Bridgend, Wales, is
of opinion that things on the British
housekeeping front are easing up a bit.
But, still, the bacon ration has been cut
again, and meat and fat are still rare
commodities.
In St. James’s Church, Turramurra,
polocrosse player Barbara Granowski
married Dr. Ted Gibson, of Summer Hill.
White marquisette over taffeta, the skirt

From Melbourne
The rare honor of a Fellowship in the
Rockefeller Foundation of America has
been given to Miss Gwendolen Burbidge,
Matron of Fairfield (Vic.) Infectious Dis-
eases Hospital. This is the first time that
the fellowship, normally only awarded to
senior doctors and surgeons, has been
awarded to an Australian nurse. Before
offering it to her the Foundation sent
one of its directors from America to in-
terview Miss Burbidge and discuss her
work with Australian hospital authorities.
The fellowship entitles Miss Burbidge to
study nurse-education in America and
Canada for six months; it also covers all
transport and tuition costs and includes
a stipend to cover cost of living. Miss
Burbidge trained at Royal Melbourne and
Women’s Hospitals. For some time she
was tutor at the Alfred and Royal Mel-
bourne Hospitals. She is the only Aus-
tralian nurse to hold the Diploma of
Hospital Administration, a London
degree. She is Federal president of the
Florence Nightingale Committee, on the
council of the College of Nursing, a
member of (he Nurses’ Board, the Metro-
politan Hospitals Nurses’ sub-committee
and the Post-War Reconstruction com-
mittee. Miss Burbidge travelled to
America last year to attend the Florence
Nightingale International Foundation and
the International Council of Nurses.
Mrs. A. L, Walters, wife of Air Com-
modore Walters, has taken an active part
in raising money for the Air Force
Scholarship Fund, and for the past three
years has been president of the ball com-
mittee. Noted for her elegant dressing,
Mrs; Walters is an excellent needlewoman
and makes a number of the smart en-
sembles she wears. Her parties are noted
for their originality, and she will be
missed in this city when she leaves in the
Strathaird on an extended visit to London.
With her goes her child, Robin, who
will study dramatic art in London.
Christ Church, South Yarra, was deco-
rated with bowls of daisies, gladioli and
hydrangeas in white and gold tonings for
the wedding of Judy, third daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. K, G, Attiwill, of Malvern,
and Ansell Egerton, only son of Mrs.
Maurice Gibbs, of South Yarra, and Com-
mander R. F. Egerton, R.N. (retired), of
England. Lady Brookes lent the veil of
Venetian point lace, which was draped
over the bride’s ivory satin gown. The
bodice of this had a heart-shaped neck-
line. Her bouquet was fashioned of gar-
denias and stephanotis. Rosemary and
Mary Attiwill were bridesmaids to their
sister; their gowns of white organdie
were patterned with pale-yellow flowers
and their bouquets were of yellow-centred
daisies, Alan Shaw was best man and
Patrick Ryan groomsman. There were
over 120 guests at the reception given by
Mr. and Mrs. Attiwill at their home, the
floral decorations of which were in the
same color-scheme as that used in the
church. Mrs. Attiwill’s black silk frock
featured an accordion-pleated panel in the
skirt, and her hat of ice-blue was matched
by her gloves.
When Fanny Blankers-Koen and her
husband arrive in this city they will get a
great welcome from the Dutch com-
munity. Members of the Netherlands-
Australian Ladies’ Society, headed by
president Mrs. J. Pieters and secretary
Mrs. J. Zwalf, will be at the airport to
meet them, and a dance, which also cele-
brates the birthday of the society, will
have the famous sprinter as guest-of-
honor. This will be held at the home of
Mrs. O. Simonson, of Caulfield, on
January 28.
Portsea has been the Mecca for many
holidaymakers, among whom have been
Housing Minister A, G. Warner and his
wife. Dr. and Mrs. J, A. Clareborough
and their children, Mr. and Mrs, Phil
Acton and son and Mrs. John Quere and
her daughter, Patricia Gibson. Guests at
an alfresco party given by Mr. and Mrs.
Keith Halley included Harold Holt and
his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Tim Joshua, Liz
Draffin, Katie Gabb and Pat Manton,
who latd this month will return to her
London job as buyer for several stores.
The Fred Matears have given a series of
cocktail-parties.
“Born Yesterday,” which opened at the
Comedy Theatre, brought a host of well-
dressed first-nighters. Mrs. M. Nathan’s
dusty-pink crepe gown had a skirt draped
at the waist and drawn back into a bustle.
A blue-fox coat was its complement.
Mrs. Fred Dennett wore florals under
white ermine. The bodice of Mrs. John
Chaldjian’s white crepe gown had an
inset of heavy white lace. Mrs. Paddy
Moran, who gave a supper party for June
Clyde, star of the show, after the perform-
ance was in white crepe. Silver beads
decorated the lovely white gown worn by
Mrs. Harold RabUng. Mrs. Samuel J.
Fletcher, wife of the U.S. Consul-General,
wore a draped gown of hyacinth-blue.
Mrs. Norman Shepherd allied Chantilly
lace and black crepe effectively. Margot
Henry’s long-sleeved dusty-pink crepe
dinner gown showed the new draped
bodice.
Nancy Lyons, Australian breaststroke
champion, who gained second place in the
110-yards race at the Olympic Games, is
here with six other members of the Uni-
versity of Queensland women’s swimming
team to compete in the annual inter-
’varsity championships. The Sydney and
Queensland girls are billeted in private
homes, their hostesses including Mes-
dames C. D. Turner and V. Cameron,
office-bearers in the Victorian Ladies’
Amateur Swimming League, Pat Jones,
Peggy Hannan, Kath True, Joy Rennie,
Penelope Nuttall and Audrey Pearce, all
Melbourne University students. On Sun-
day afternoon the inter-’varsity men
swimmers and a men’s team from New
Zealand and the girl swimmers were enter-
tained at an afternoon and evening get-
together party at Ripponlea, the home of
Pat Jones. y
If you have a fur coat which has seen
better days, you may, by using the good
parts as trimmings, make fashionable for
next winter your suits and coats, A
recently-returned traveller who saw most
of the winter collections in London says
the shops are selling fur trimmings of
every variety. The flaring peplum of a
tweed coat is edged with narrow fur and
repeated at the sleeve-cuffs ; pockets and
collars are finished with fur trimming and
tiny little berets of fur add to the smart-
ness of the ensemble. Norman Hartnell,
the Queen’s designer, adds to his wasp-
waisted full-skirted coat a tiny cape of
nutria fur, and with it goes a huge nutria
muff. Digby Morton, another English
designer, fashions a tweed suit of fine
checks, and to the tight-fitting jacket adds
a swirl of fur which forms a long cross-
over rever finishing at the waist.
One of the most attractive outfits seen
at Moonee Valley was worn by June
Manson, a junior-navy suit, the jacket
braided across the front; her hat was
of navy and white candy-stripe taffeta.
Mrs. Jack Godby, a recent bride from
Scotland, wore with her beige tailored
suit a pale-blue straw hat trimmed with
mauve grosgrain ribbon. Mrs. James
Buchanan and Rhoda Taylor wore black
ensembles. Mrs. S. Cain set off her black
frock and hip-length summer ermine coat
with a mauve-and-blue grosgrain off-the-
face hat.
Lady Huntingfield, who was with her
husband, Lord Huntingfield, a former
Governor of Victoria and now in Aus-
tralia on a holiday, wore a navy braided
coat and wide flat coolie-type hat in navy
straw. Mrs, A, G. Hunter contrasted her
black frock and wide-brimmed hat with
a strawberry-toned coat. Topping Mrs.
Leith Crow’s grey suit was a petunia straw
hat, laden with petunias and blue roses.
A wedding of special interest in clerical
circles will be held early in February;
this will be that of Janet, daughter of the
principal of the Methodist Ladies’
College, Dr. A. H. Wood, and Mrs.
Wood, and the Rev. Howard Secomb,
son of the President-General of the
Methodist Church in Australia, Dr. H. G.
Secomb, and Mrs. Secomb. The fathers
of both bride and ’groom will officiate at
the nuptials, which will be held at the
Auburn Methodist Church ; reception will
follow at the M.L.C. Later the young
couple will go as missionaries to Tonga,
in the South Pacific, where Janet was
born.

Life assurance is a voluntary system of
collective security that has withstood the
tests of time, including the strain of
financial depressions and the crises of
two world wars. It is also a stabilising
influence in the economic and social struc-
ture, whereby the State as well as policy-
holders and their dependants benefit.
There is no substitute for the protection
that a contract with a sound regular-
bonus-paying office affords. Moreover,
the offices cater for a wide variety of in-
dividual wants and needs outside the
range of the basic provisions of social-
security legislation. For these and a
variety of other reasons, every man ought
to make a life policy the sheet-anchor of
his investments.
One of Australia’s five big mutual
offices, the T, and G. has put on as much
weight over the last decade as it did
during the preceding 60-odd years:
1938. 1948.

margins in all matters upon which sound-
ness and progress depend.
A record amount of new business was
written last term —£28,299,660 (up
£1,649,692), of which £19,668,911 (up
£488,048) was ordinary and £8,630,749
(up £1,161,644) industrial. Group assur-
ance, which is associated with the super-
annuation schemes of commercial houses,
again figured prominently among the new
ordinary contracts. This class of busi-
ness, which has become a feature of the
ordinary department, promises to raise
some intricate actuarial and other prob-
lems before long. The writing of in-
dustrial contracts of less than 25 years’
duration has been discontinued, owing to
the drop in interest rates and rise in costs.
Combining the figures of the two life
departments, total revenue was
£10,453,113 (up £751,879), of which
£8,324,187 (up £643,478) was premiums
and £2,128,926 (up £108,410) interest and
rents. After paying all legitimate claims
and exes, and writing £32,443 off the
book-value of premises and sending
£4900 to the staff fund, £4,500,991 re-
mained. This was added to the assurance
funds, raising them to £58,594,551. These
funds have the support and assistance of
£1,322,441 (up £51,324) of reserves,
which also belong to policyholders—
there are no shareholders. The growth
in reserves was due almost entirely to
transfer of £50,000 from the expanding
and profitable accident department.
A tight hold was maintained on exes.,
which were slightly lower at 15.1 p.c, of
net premiums in the ordinary and 29.6
p.c. in the industrial section. That leaves
out of the reckoning taxes, depreciation
and contributions to the staff fund. The
gross rate of interest earned on mean
assurance funds was 2s, 2d. p.c. lighter
at £3 17s. p.c. The net effective rate on
these funds (after deducting taxes) was
£3 9s. lid. p.c. Since the co. now values
its policy liabilities on a stringent 2\ p.c.
basis, there is a comfortable margin be-
tween the assumed and actual rate of
earning.
There was a growth of £114,200 in the
surplus available for distribution (excess
of funds over liabilities under policies):
Net surplus— 1940. 1946. 1947. 1948.
Ordinary £586,776 £665,828 £744,470 £880,518
Industrial 352,951 324,514 338,478 366,630
Total £939,727 £990,342 £1,082,948 £1,197,148
After reserving £25,000 in the ordinary
and £20,000 in the industrial section the
balance was distributed as bonuses
among policyholders at the same satis-
factory rates as for the previous term.
The year’s growth in total assets
amounted to £5,111,734, of which
£4,664,688 went into Government securi-
ties, now equal to 77.5 p.c. of the bal-
ance-sheet total: —

Clyde Engineering has not only entered
a new field of wholesale distribution since
the war, but has widened its manufactur-
ing scope to embrace consumer goods
as well as heavy capital equipment—the
aim being greater stability and continuity
than heavy contracts alone afforded
in the difficult ’thirties. The broader
policy is reflected in the directors’ latest
proposal to transfer the Granville
engineering shops to a new subsidiary,
leaving the parent purely a holding con-
cern with the more comprehensive title
of Clyde Industries, Ltd.
The Granville works, which date back
to 1881 and have figured prominently in
Australian locomotive manufacture, in-
clude a large boiler-making shop with
presses, a foundry, forge, wood-
mill and machine shops. Periodic
slumps in demand had given the co.’s
finances a chequered history when its
scrip was first listed on ’Change in 1944;
but war had by then brought its plant into
special prominence, and all units were
extended on naval, aircraft, railway and
other contracts. From 1942-45 the Com-
monwealth Government stood as guaran-
tor of Clyde’s bank overdrafts and was
represented on its board.
Since the war the aircraft division at
Granville has been switched to producing
omnibus bodies, though Clyde still shares
control (with the Fairey Aviation Co., of
England) of repair shops at Bankstown
airfield. The locomotive section has
received large orders from Oriental
countries as well as from State Govern-
ments, but production is seriously lagging
through shortage of steel and low output
per man-hour. To make diesel loco-
motives for the first time in Australia an
agreement has lately been reached with
General Motors of U.S.A., but in this
case the dollar scarcity threatens to hold
up proceedings indefinitely.
Trading results in the heavy engineering
divisions are thus disappointing in rela-
tion to the opportunities presented by the
market, and the board voices concern at
the effects of discontinuous output on the
profitability of its long-term contracts.
Some of the newer Clyde activities evi-
dently came to the rescue last term. An
improvement of £34,369 in trading profit,
though partly absorbed in depreciation
(up £10,266) and tax (up £4771), left net
declared profit £19,332 higher than in
1947:

The net £58,453 was 11.3 p.c. on ordinary
capital after paying pref. dividends, com-
pared with 10.7, 9, and 6.4 p.c. in the
three previous years.
The newer interests include the Paul
and Gray ship-chandlery and hardware
distributing business, acquired by Clyde
in 1947 ; Clyde Batteries Pty., turning out
a wide range of vehicle and storage
batteries; Clyde Motors Pty., agents for
Nash cars in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land ; and three new subsidiaries, bought
last term, which produce cotton-waste
and similar cleaning materials. Sections
of the Granville works are also engaged
in making lawnmowers, basins and baths.
These developments had already called
for a doubling of capital in 1947, and a
further 80,328 £1 ords. were issued last
term —half as payment for new sub-
sidiaries and half for, cash to Clyde’s
chairman, R. E. Purves. The over-all
balance-sheet was then on a scale nearly
four times as great as in 1943:

Despite the shortage of basic metals,
stocks rose £291,445 (or 43 p.c.) last year.
Debtors owed £100,420 more at the close
of the term, with fixed assets higher by
£125,097, and in consequence Clyde’s
liabilities had risen £411,875 (including
£294,633 additional overdraft).
The tightness of finances has been re-
lieved since the close of accounts by
further capital issues—106,066 ords.

tal to £1,086,394. Allowing for these

After 17 years in the wilderness and the
jettisoning of £211,263 of capital, reduc-
ing the figure to £239,075 in 441,369
shares of 10s. lOd. each, the business was
got on an even keel in 1940, and has
made heartening progress since. Over
the last eight years divs. have averaged
approximately 10 p.c., and £117,432 of
reserves has been accumulated. The
period, however, was one of shortages,
inflation and a ready market & rising
prices for the worsted cloth and other
products the co.’s mills at Albury, Orange
and Goulburn turn out.
The improvement in mill profit, etc.
(£130,239) was £14,632 last term. In-
cluding £33,719 (up £5400) set aside for
the taxgatherer, exes. (£73,598) took
£6922 of the gain. That left the net re-
sult (£56,641) £7710 stronger at 23.6 p.c.
on capital as against 20.4, 12.6, 11.5, 8.3,
11.7, 9.8, 14.9 and 12.7 p.c. back to 1940.
The div. was lifted from 12.3 p.c. to
13.8 p.c.
Exactly what the future holds for the
business is difficult to say. The medium-
grade worsteds in which the co. specialises
enjoy a good reputation in the market.
In more competitive pre-war days the
co. had been handicapped by heavy over-
head, owing to the position of the mills.
Today compensating factors are full em-
ployment, high incomes, a ready market
and advantages in respect of the labor
problem. To what extent price-rises that
will inevitably follow withdrawal of the
subsidy on raw wool and imported yarns
will affect consumer demand remains to
be seen. Anything that arrests growth
of turnover will make net earnings more
sensitive to costs, which -are still climb-
ing. Much will depend upon whether
the N. S. Wales Government is prepared
to give more than lip-service to the de-
centralisation plank of its policy by grant-
ing adequate rail-freight concessions.
Meanwhile there is a wide margin be-
tween earnings and distributions, and,
financially and otherwise, the business is
in better trim than ever:

The slip of £2093 in last term’s profit is
more apparent than real. The co.’s
100,000-ton-p.a. cement plant at Railton
(Tas.) worked close to capacity through-
out the year, and there was a ready
market for the product. Manufacturing,
fuel, packing and transport costs con-
tinued to rise, and the trend was aggra-
vated by introduction of the 40-hour
week. Still, the plant is alongside good
shale, limestone and clay deposits, with
relatively cheap hydroelectric power
available, all of which are helpful factors
in comparative costs. The new asbestos-
cement plant, alongside the cement works,
came into production early in the term,
but operated on one shift only, owing to
shortage of asbestos fibre. There is keen
demand for the product, but what profit,
if any, was earned therefrom isn’t men-
tioned.
With the gain from expanded produc-
tion and a lift of ss. a ton in the con-
trolled selling-price of cement, the co. was
able to show £24,957 more gross earnings
(£136,393). Exes. (£94,455) increased by

No Social Plan is stronger than the
industry that provides the money for it.
Everyone is in favour of the ideal that
children be well fed and grow up to be strong,
educated men and women.
Everyone wants to see the gnawing fear of
unemployment and want removed from the
fruitful years of every man’s life, and old age
be freed from some of its cares.
Every factory every farm and station
- that is run more efficiently; every machine
that enables men to do better work in less time;
every man who does an honest day’s work for
the money that he is paid; these bring us closer
to the day when strong and efficient workers
will have enough left over to provide good
living for the weak and the aged.
If our attitude towards industry rural
and manufacturing is aimed at encouraging
and rewarding growth and efficiency of pro-
duction, the day may come quickly.
In the meantime, this Bank will go on
serving its customers —Jielping them, where it
can, to make the most of their opportunities.

£26,816, leaving the net result,
after minor reserve adjustment,
£2093 lighter at £42,268, second-
best since 1940. Exes., however,
included an extra £lB,OOO for
taxation (£49,000) and an addi-
tional £lO,OOO for depreciation,
etc. (£35,000). The etc. is
£25,000 earmarked for plant re-
newal, and placed to a special
reserve for the purpose. The
£42,268 of profit covered the
pref. div. and 12.6 p.c. on the
£255,834 of ord. capital as
against 13.4 p.c. and 6.3 p.c. for
the two preceding terms and 22.1
p.c. in 1939. The div. was kept
at 11.1 p.c., and looks like re-
maining there for the present.
Though the Government
keeps a close watch on selling
prices, and it is doubtful
whether costs have yet reached
their peak, output seems reason-
ably assured for some time
ahead, thanks to the big con-
struction programmes of Electro-
lytic Zinc and other industrial
undertakings in the island; and
there is a deferred programme
of public works, including road
construction, in the background.
How far all this will ultimately
benefit Goliath’s net earnings
depends largely upon the final
relationship of costs and prices.
The co, is well equipped, tech-
nically and financially, to win
whatever profits are to be had
from the industry. And the new
asbestos-cement factory hasn’t
yet had much of a chance to
show what it can do.

Australian Gold, operating at
Pahang (Malaya), is still in the
rehabilitation stage. With 20-
head of stamps falling (70 be-
fore the war), the co. treated
16,993 tons of 7.o6dwt. ore for
a recovery of 51040 z. fine gold
for the year to end March,
1948. The value of the gold just
about met the cost of recovering
it. Including some sundry in-
come, profit for the period was
£1655. Co. had gone to its
bankers for £105,417 and to
sundry creditors for £12,850.
Government securities, cash and
debtors’ balances totalled
£57,147. Expenditure on reha-
bilitation amounted to £61,436,
and there was £67,708 in sus-
pense account, being excess of
assets over liabilities in Malaya
prior to the invasion. Go ’s
claim for $307,000 against the
Army has been rejected, and its
war-damage claim for $3,160,000
has not yet received official
sanction. The new mill, now
about 75 p.c. complete, is
scheduled to crush a minimum
105 tons sulphides daily. As un-
watering and underground de-
velopment proceeds, a daily
maximum of 270 tons is ex-
pected to be reached. The ore-
body, four miles in length, is
served by four main and six
intermediate shafts. Bigger
throughput should help costs,
which are still rising while the
official buying price of gold re-
mains anchored to the U.S.
dollar.

SUNDRY SHWS
MELBOURNE MUSIC.
Last year organised music
achieved a record. Upwards of
8000 subscribers to the A.B.C.
“celebrity” concerts (every con-
cert given three times, which
means over 10,000 listeners).
Philharmonics and Liedertafels
packing the Town Hall from
flpor to ceiling, the A.B.C. pro-
ducing an endless succession of
virtuosi out of its coffers, the
Tait hat materialising singers
and musicians like rabbits, half
a dozen musical societies play-
ing sometimes as good and better
music to sparse audiences at the
Assembly and other halls in the
city, opera seasons, Italian and
Australian, the Hollway Gov-
ernment distributing, or
threatening to distribute, lar-
gesse, a State orchestra in the
offing, youth concerts, children’s
concerts, Music-for-the-People
concerts in the Botanic Gardens,
a handsome official bequest to
the National Theatre movement
for opera and, finally, a title for
that prince of organisers Pro-
fessor Heinze.
A royal dish for the music-
tasters. It included Ginette
Neveu (violinist), Benno Moisei-
witsch, Jacob Lateiner, a Polish
pianist from Cuba, Hephzibah
Menuhin, whose occasional ex-
cursions from her husband’s
sheep-station in the Western Dis-
trict to the Town Hall platform
were a demonstration of how
skill can be maintained under
any conditions, the young Hun-
garian tenor Miklos Gafni, op-
timistically presented as the new
Caruso, and, too, Juan Relam-
pago, guitarist, who displayed a
skill on his instrument second to
none of the more orthodox
virtuosi.
Paul Klecki, the Polish con-
ductor, conducted two important
first performances in Australia
—Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 and
Vaughan Williams’s Sixth.
Harold Blair, the Queensland
aboriginal, made history by sing-
ing in one performance of the
“Messiah.” The National Theatre
Movement presented “The Magic
Flute,” “The Flying Dutchman,”
and “Hansel and Gretel,” and
Smetana’s “The Bartered Bride”
was done for the first time, and
done well.
While the audiences poured
into the Town Hall almost
nightly the critics seemed
bothered; one critic naively
confessed that he had attended
three functions on the same
evening and listened to a fourth
on the wireless while speeding
from one hall to another in a
taxi, though this did not inhibit
him from coming to a judgment.
But the 1949 season promises
to be even more stupendous than
the season of 1948. Music-
lovers will soon be knowing all
about Elizabeth Schwarzkopf,
the lyric soprano, and Rudolph
Schock, the Salzburg tenor, as
they already know about Todd
Duncan, the negro singer, and
Marjorie Lawrence, and the
Town Hall Stein way is destined
shortly to be hammered by the
sensational Russian Aleksandr
Helmann, the glamorous Pales-
tinian Pnina Salzman and the
young Rumanian Dinu Lipatti;
and, perhaps, it will need to be
reinforced for the duo-pianists
Rawicz and Landauer,
The A.B.C. “celebrity” pro-
grammes have not been an-
nounced, but Rafael Kubelik
will doubtless conduct it with
his hair, while that fine organisa-
tion the Musica Viva Society is
contemplating performing the
entire cycle of Beethoven’s string
quartets in 10 recitals. The
Melbourne Philharmonic will
perform “King David” and
“The Children’s Crusade” of
Pierne.
In all the exotic medley of
1948 there was only one Aus-
tralian item —“Corroboree,” by
Sydneysider John Antill, though
some Melbourne composers
made apologetic appearances at
the Assembly Hall, where the
audiences were invariably micro-
scopic.
"Manon."
The plot of Abbe Prevost’s
novel has yielded a rich harvest
for composers: the ballet by
Haleyy and operas by Auber,
Puccini and Massenet —that by
the later Frenchman, given an
airing at Sydney Tivoli, hav-
ing the most lasting qualities,
chiefly by reason of a score
which, if demonstrating Mas-
senet’s weaknesses, also brings
out writing which is always
effective, agreeable, of a lively
invention and possesses above all
the quality of melodic voluptu-
ousness which is in keeping with
the character of the heroine.
It is in writing for the voice
that the composer’s limita-
tions of style are revealed. Oc-
casionally he lapses into the
sentimentally saccharine. The
quartet, though the situation
gave him ample scope for
dramatic music, is too light
for the dramatic content of the
text. Verdi’s “Rigoletto” quartet
had a situation comparable in
dramatic value to this, yet how
incomparably greater is the
Italian’s work. But Massenet
allotted two fine arias to the
tenor: “The Dream” and “De-
part, Fair Vision” ; and orches-
trally the score is first rate; it
was handled by Franco Ghione
with a tight control throughout.
The device of the leitmotif,
which the composer borrowed
from Wagner, lends particular
distinction to this opera, and
Massenet’s adaptation of it is
purely Gallic. Following Euro-
pean custom, no doubt in the
interests of time-saving, the
Cour la Reine scene was elimi-
nated from Act 111, and with it
Manon’s lively gavotte, “Hear
the Voice of Youth.”
The cast was the best gathered
together during the current Syd-
ney season. Rina Malatrasi, in
the title role, used her beautiful
lyric soprano with great artistry
in her arias and in the numerous
duets with the Chevalier Des
Grieux. She also pumped plenty
of vivacity into her acting.
Vivacity is a quality completely
congruous with the character —■
a young lady bound for a con-
vent to finish her schooling who,
after the briefest acquaintance
with a gentleman—about 10
minutes —abancjpns these educa-
tional advantages in favor of
running off to Paris to live with
him without benefit of clergy.
Rodolfo Moraro, the tenor,
seems to be an inconsistent
singer. In “The Barber” he sang
very ordinarily; yet as the
Chevalier he came to light with
a voice which combined beauty
and power. His most effective air
was “The Dream,” in which he
used the mezzo, voce with fine
skill. In that lovely song of the
renunciation of worldly plea-
sures, “Depart, Fair Vision,”
Moraro’s high - register notes
rang clear as a bell.
One of this company’s most
accomplished singers is the basso
Antonio Cassinelli, whose voice
recalls that of Apollo Gran-
forte, who was here with
Toti dal Monte. As the Cheva-
lier’s father, commanding,
richly-garbed, he sang with
splendid dramatic emphasis, Leo
Piccioli, who so impressed with
his work as Figaro in “The Bar-
ber,” again gave a spirited per-
formance as Lescaut, Manon’s
guardsman cousin. The settings
for the opera were particularly
good, and the stage-direction
could scarcely be bettered.
After “Manon” came “Faust.”
In the whole range of opera
there is no counterpart for sheer
gorgeousness of its vocal con-
tent than the Garden Scene:
Siebel’s Flower Song, the famous
“All Hail, Thou Dwelling,” the
duets and the quartet, the
“Eternelle” which winds up
the night-scene—these have en-
thralled audiences for 90 years
and will go on enthralling them.
Antonio Cassinelli, a striking
figure as Mephistopheles, domi-
nated every scene in which he
appeared. His “Calf of Gold”
had the true sardonic ring, his
Cavatina was contemptuously
mocking. Mercedes Fortunati
was a Marguerite quite unre-
sponsive to Faust’s passionate
outpourings in the love scenes,
but she atoned for this lapse by
some beautiful singing and by
going mad very prettily in the
prison scene. Ferdinando li
Donni was a manly Valentine,
and, allowing that a man may
still sing strongly minutes after
six inches of sword has pierced
his vitals, his death scene was
convincing. The Redemption
scene was abandoned —no doubt
had a device such as that used at
Her Majesty’s during the last
Melba season to transport Mar-
guerite and her two guardian
angels to Heaven been attempted
the ancient Tivoli building would
have been tested to the limits.
But if it cannot manage an
ascent into Heaven the Tiv. was
at least able to drop Meph.
and his victim through fire and
smoke into hell.
Olympic Film.
Doing the rounds at present
without attracting anything like
the interest it deserves, the
Olympic Games film “The Glory
of Sport” is, apart from its
special sporting interest, one of
the finest documentaries yef
sighted ; actually an outstanding
piece of good journalism.
Direction, production, photo-
graphy are each of the highest
order; editing, however, could
in places be a mite more strip-
gent. It is certainly not to be
confused with a mere newsreel
record of the Games; the very
full news-coverage is there, but
the whole panorama of the
Games has been moulded into a
dramatic unity.
The film kicks off with some
beautifully done stuff set in the
mountains of Greece, depicting
the ceremony of lighting the
torch. Then off with the relays
of runners over hill, dale and
ocean to St. Moritz in Switzer-
land, the setting for the Winter
Games. The photography here,
with the scenery to work on, is
superb ; particularly effective a
trick performed with the techni-
color camera by which the snow-
clad mountains, seen at first in
sombre shades of greys, are
made to blossom into color as
the Games come to life, and to
fade again at their conclusion.
That covers the first half of
the film (which in its entirety
stretches over a full double-bill
programme); then off again with
the runners to the pageantry of
the official opening in London
—a scene as impressive as any-
thing that has ever been done on
the screen. After marching
nation by nation in a circuit of
the track, past the King taking
the salute, the hundreds of com-
petitors are drawn up in the
centre of the arena to await the
arrival of the final torch-bearer.
As the runner enters the arena
the vast mass in the centre
breaks ranks and rushes to the
edge of the track to greet him —
like a multicolored river in
flood.
After that, full-swing into the
Games ; flashes of everything ;
glimpses of straining muscular
perfection, and of faces register-
ing a variety of extreme emo-
tions ; a delightful drive through
the English countryside with the
cyclists; another run through
the suburbs of London with the
Marathon runners ; a day on the
river with the oarsmen (though
Merv Wood’s sculling victory is
an unhappy omission); and a
fish-eye view of the swimmers
and divers; scenes in brilliant
sunshine ; others with the techni-
color softened to normality by
drizzling rain ; and then the deli-
cately handled and moving
scenes as the Games finish for
another Olympiad. It is a film
to be seen.

A NEW DEVELOPMENT
Spreader Firing, combined with
Forward Moving Grafe
The introduction of the
Forward Moving Grate,
discharging ash continu-
ously, has widened the scope
of Spreader Firing because:
1. Combustion conditions
are not disturbed by inter-
mittent ash removal.
2. There is no clinker for-
mation, even with ash
having very low fusion tem-
perature, as the bulk of the
air required for combustion
passes through and coqls
the ash layer, thereby
avoiding harmful deposits
on the pressure parts.
3. Automatic control is
simply applied.
4. High burning rates are
readily attained, as the fuel
and the air are evenly dis-
tributed over every square
foot of grate area.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
It is quite on the cards that Cap-
tain Cook once trod the ground now
occupied by Moorefield racecourse,
situated as it is within view of Botany
Bay. Many racegoers are of the
opinion that facilities there have been
improved very little since Cook’s day,
and it would bq an ideal spot to
commence implementation of the oft-
advocated Australian policy “Give it
back to the abos.”
Actually, in pre-war days, for the
lightly-attended, miid-week meetings,
Moorefield was a delightful little
track, much resembling as it does
some of the smaller t English courses
such as Windsor. But for present-
day week-end attendances it is simply
impossible.
For the S.T.C.’s meeting there on
Saturday fields were 'large but the
quality was poor, and the racing, with
an odd exception, not particularly
thrilling. Most winners were well
backed and included a couple of
favorites, but the four-year-old Agin-
court gelding Skip Court (W. Hughes)
did the bookies a good turn by start-
ing practically unbacked in the Fly-
ing (6f.) and beating the heavily-
supported stablemates Septet and Per-
sian Prince. Bookmakers probably
held as much on the Flying as they
did on any two other races on the
card, and for most of them Skip
Court represented a clean skinner.
Not a word was heard from the
young “leviathan” who recently filled
columns of the daily press with
anguished tales of his colossal losses
when the favorite won the Villiers.
After their noble result on the
Flying the bookies were moved to
great liberality when it came to the
10-furlongs Peter Moore Handicap;
they quoted only five of the eight
runners at 6 to 1 and less. The
country mare Poinciana was favorite
at 5 to 2 but disappointed; Skilled,
a five-year-old Revelation gelding
trained by W. M. McCurley, led all
the way for an effortless win, Rifle
finishing second, beaten four lengths,
and Bell Rock third.
The mile Welter was won by a
venerable combination in Marlume
with R. James up. Marlume, a bay
gelding by Marconigram, is rising
nine, and James, who seldom rides m
the city these days, admits to halt
a century.
Interesting runners in the mile
Kogarah Mixed Stakes were Stanley
Wootton’s imported pair Furdan ana
Formentera, trained by McCarten.
Both are four-year-olds—Furdan a
bay horse by Furrokh Siyar—Dancing
Light and Formentera a chestnut by
Fairhaven—Drama. Though he is yet
a maiden, while his companion has
won at Windsor, Furdan shaped much
the better of the two to finish a
fairish fifth in the Kogarah, which
was won by Caribbean (J. Lordan).
In other events at Moorefield,
Chartreuse (N. Sellwood) accounted
for a bunch of two-year-old fillies,
and Corosan (W. Cook) proved too
hot for their brethren; ridden by
J. Thompson, Shannon Rise, a three-
year-old Midstream filly, won the
Brighton Mixed (6f.), and Barita (A.
Hazelton) took the Rockdale Mixed
(10L).

Conducted in excellent weather, and
well attended, the M.R.C. meeting at
Moonee Valley on Saturday was
marked by some rattling close finishes
—one at least was close enough to
thoroughly rattle the intelligence-ser-
vice which usually enables book-
makers at the back of the stand to
bet the right way on the result of
photo.-finishes which they have not
seen. After Ungar and Denhoti had
passed the post locked together in
the finish of the six-furlongs Heroic
Handicap, the books were betting 10
to 1 on Denhoti and 5 to 1 against
Ungar, but the camera gave it by a
half-head to Ungar. Unusual to find
a winner at a better price after he
has passed the post than before the
start; Ungar had started at fours,
while as little as 3 to 1 was laid. It
was Ungar’s ’ first appearance since a
spell, and Denhoti (11 to 8) was
favored to beat him.
Just as close was the finish of the
13-furlongs Hillcrest Handicap, old
Logical (P. Simonds) winning by a
head from Dream Rocks, with Real
Guy, a half-head away, third. Yet
another thriller was the Altona Handi-
cap for two-year-old fillies with the
Hellespont filly Bright Sea hard ridden
by Breasley to beat Happy Medium
by a head; Jhelum was third, the
three placegetters being nearly equal-
favorites and all other runners at long
odds.
However, Damon, another son of
Hellespont, made no bones about his
victory in the 10-furlongs Ellendale
Handicap for three-year-olds. Giving
jockey R. Heather a very easy ride,
Damon won by four lengths from
Baldur after starting at the surpris-
ingly good odds of 10 to 9. On form
Damon should have been at long
odds-on in Saturday’s company.
It is seldom these days that one
sees a horse saddled up twice in an
afternoon at metropolitan courses;
when they are, they usually score
at the second attempt. After
finishing fourth behind Ungar and
company in the Heroic Handicap, the
grey Landlaw gelding Our Land, a
particularly powerful-looking fellow,
went out again in the mile Des-
borough Handicap and won nicely
from Judgment and Astor. Not only
do these dual-starters often win at
their second lash, but they’re usually
at good odds; Our Land was 15 to
1. Completing the card at the Valley,
favorite Napier, a son of Dhoti-
Malaga, took the Altona Handicap
for two-year-old colts and geldings.

A month or so back Athletic Asso-
ciation officials were entertaining rosy
dreams of having this year the most
prosperous season in their history.
The Olympic Games had revived pub-
lic interest in athletics, and the asso-
ciation planned to hold and cash-in
on that interest by importing overseas
Olympians to compete here against
our best. One by one, however,
their plans seem to be drifting into
the red.
Clashes between Mrs. Blankers-
Koen, who arrived last week, and
Shirley Strickland would be a great
dra«-card; the Dutchwoman will still
no doubt draw the crowds, but Shirley
Strickland, it seems, is on the sick list.
Panamanian sprinter Lloyd La Beach
arrived last week, only to find that his
prospectively strongest local opponent
Treloar is also hors de combat.
Jamaican Herb McKenley, after tem-
porarily vanishing in America, will
arrive to find Curotta, by unhappy
coincidence, also a casualty.

During 1948 the N.S.W. Lawn
Tennis Association spent, as it in-
tends to do again this year, £6OO on
the encouragement and development
of young players; on
a comprehensive scheme
actually to sift the
tennis talent of the State
for potential Davis Cup
material. The plan is in
its fourth year now, and
one tangible result has
been an increase in the
number of registered
players in country dis-
tricts of from 8000 to
18,000 in two years;
there are some 30,000
registered players in
the metropolitan area.
The N.S.W. age cham-
pionships under-13,
under-15 and under-17
classes conducted in
May, attracted 11,075
entries.
The L.T.A. has
achieved an amazingly
thorough coverage of
the State with the seem-
ingly inadequate sum
of £6OO. Part of the
money went in assisting
the coaching - schools
conducted by the Hard-
court Association; but
the greater part was em-
ployed in dragneting the
country areas. Under
the original scheme
country clubs and asso-
ciations were asked to
nominate their best
young players those
between 14 and 16
years of age being preferred—and
from these was made a selection of
40 boys and 12 girls, who were taken
at the Association’s expense to Syd-
ney for intensive training last Janu-
ary. Mrs. Molesworth handled the
girls,'and several leading coaches the
boys.
That scheme, however, was even-
tually considered inadequate; it was
decided instead to divide the State
into six areas and form schools at
Tamworth, Grafton, Newcastle,
Orange, Wagga and Wollongong.
Classes comprising 20 boys and five
girls attended schools at each of these
centres last September. Rounding off
the scheme the L.T.A. has sent lead-
ing coaches touring country areas to
instruct older players in the latest
coaching methods, and the handling
of the younger players. As L.T.A.
secretary Victor Kelly remarks, “If
nothing comes of this plan then the
talent simply isn’t there.”
* * * *
When she leaves for home Ameri-
can tennis girl Doris Hart is going
to get a hefty bill for excess baggage,
if she takes with her all the pots
she has collected here. With the
Australian championships and other
tournaments yet to come, Miss Hart
has so far contested nine events and
won eight of them. Her collection
of titles comprises N.S.W. singles,
doubles and mixed doubles, Victorian
singles and- mixed doubles, and,
acquired last week, the South Aus.
singles, doubles and mixed doubles.
**' * *
John Bromwich is having one of
his periodical scraps with the Aus-
tralian L.T.A.,. which seems to take
offence very readily at anything its
leading player happens to say or do.
Brom. is in strife this time for having
mentioned in a press interview that
he had written to the L.T.A. asking
for some particulars concerning the
next Davis Cup tour. Sir Norman
Brookes at once rushed to arms,
painted a torrid picture of Bromwich
holding a gun at the head of the
authorities and spoke of “disciplin-
ary action.” Bromwich’s remarks,
quoth Sir Norman, were tactless.
Apparently, however, S’Norman
doesn’t consider it tactless for the
head of the tennis governing body
to publicly describe the country’s
best player as “washed up.” That
was after seeing Bromwich win two
Wimbledon titles and fail narrowly
in the third.

Morning at Sydney Cricket
Ground:
Though play lasted less than 90
minutes, the final day of the N.S.W.
v. Queensland match was a cricketing
gem. It could have been as dull
as , ditchwater; N.S.W. needed 143
runs for an outright win, had 11 men
to get them and all day to do it in.
The handful of spectators waited
anxiously for the first over which
would tell them whether they were
going to see the Morris who could
stay at the wicket all day for a dozen
runs, or the other Morris who in one
day’s play in England hit a ■ century
before lunch, another between lunch
and tea, and the best part of a third
between tea and stumps.
They were not left long in doubt.
Taking the strike, with young Burke
at the other end, Morris took a
glance at the field, shaped up and
cracked the first ball away for an
easy couple; it was on. For 82
minutes the crowd was treated to the
brightest and most delightful display
of* brilliant stroke-making the S.C.G.
has seen in years. For the most part
Burke, who seemed only occasionally
to get the strike, was content to hold
up his end and leave the scoring to
“He Won't be able to complain, like his father, that he took
the game up too late.”
Morris; yet he did play some very
pretty shots. One got the impression
that every other ball was being cracked
for four; actually Morris hit 15
boundaries on the way to his century-
before-lunch. When he made the
winning hit Morris was 10.8 n. 0.;
Burke and sundries contributed the
remainder of the necessary; and
every spectator left the ground with
revived hope for the future of the
game.
* * * *
In direct contrast to the Sydney
match was the South Aus. v. Vic.
affair at Melbourne. It too was
restricted by rain to three days, but
in its conclusion, with Victoria win-
ning by 40 runs on the first innings,
it was as dull as the other was bright.
Victoria scored 281 in the first
innings, South Aus. responded with
241, and that was the final result.
The Yarrasiders began their second
knock in scratchy fashion with fiye
down for 77, and, after Fothergill
(43) and Hassett (24) had for a while
staved off the inevitable, wound up
with a total of 149, The South Aus-
tralians then had a good sporting
chance of turning a first-innings defeat
into an outright win, but chose in-
stead to go meekly; the openers
ambled along ever so quietly to put
up 10 runs in half an hour; in the
same space of time at the S.C.G.
Morris and Burke had hdd 50-odd
on the board. The other batsmen
followed suit and the game was
solemnly interred.

Big Company Issues
The amount of share-capital
and premium-capital raised by
public companies (including pri-
vate companies in process of
conversion) during 1948 has been
estimated at £38,737,000, only
£7,490,074 of it in preference
scrip. Debenture-issues by com-
panies aggregated £2,720,000,
and public-body loans took
another £3,085,000 from the in-
vestment market. The total of
£44,542,000 is by far the largest
amount that the market Has
been asked for at any time in
Australia’s history (Government
loans excluded). The share- and
premium-capital portion of it
(£38.7 million) compared with
£22.2 million for 1947 and £6.3
million in 1939.
One reason for the large
amount of share-capital raised
in 1948 was that there is a big
lag of reconstruction to make up
as a result of the war. Another
is the high cost of re-equipment;
still another the urge of industry
to expand in spite of all the in-
dustrial problems of the
moment. Also pertinent have
been the Treasury’s banking
policy, which forces traders on
to the investment market for
funds rather than the banks,
and, more recently, the Can-
berra taxation policy which has
made the lot of private com-
panies especially burdensome,
with the result that many are
changing over to public con-
cerns.
The large amount of capital
asked for in 1948 has had its
effect on the demand for exist-
ing Stock Exchange securities.
The strength of the market de-
clined slightly during the last
12 months, though this was in a
measure the result of a weak-
ness in New York stock prices.
Another factor in the slacker
sharemarket was the continuance
of the Socialist reign at Can-
berra, with price-control still en-
forced by the States and com-
pany taxation still in the penalty
category. Still, the financial
year 1947-48 was one in which
there was a high level of per-
sonal saving: the Common-
wealth Statistician estimates that
in that period savings of the
people amounted to £204 mil-
lion, compared with £l4B mil-
lion in 1946-47, £264 million in
1945-46, £267 million in 1944-45
and £323 million in 1943-44,
when war-enforced saving was
most obvious in this country.
Recent figures show that the
liquid holdings of the people—
including companies—are still
rising, though how much is in
the nature of personal holdings
is hard to decide.
“Gross private investment”
during 1947-48 was estimated
officially at £355 million, com-
pared with a revised figure of
£330 million in 1946-47, £5O
million in 1943-44, and £l4O
million in 1938-39. This item is
said to embrace outlay on
“machinery, plant and equip-
ment, motor vehicles (including
non-business vehicles), other
transport equipment, new build-
ing (including building by Gov-
ernment housing authorities)
and building maintenance and
change in value of stocks.”
It seems obvious that a return
to freer enterprise and greater
per-capita production would give
the sharemarket a decided fillip.
At present industry’s capacity is
limited by coal a,nd manpower
factors. The small rise in com-
pany income from £155 million
to £167 million last year was by
no means in keeping with the
expansion in other incomes,
largely because of price-control,
and company income is subject
to much- higher taxation than
wages, salaries or professional
earnings.
Kennarcf Bros. (Sydney)
J. B. Were and Son, share-
brokers, bought outright a four-
sevenths interest in the Kennard
Bros, partnership to facilitate its
conversion to a public company.
Four of the seven partners
passed their equity to Were’s for
£60,000, which represents 7s. 6d.
each for 160,000 shares of ss.
nominal value in the new co.
By agreement, Were’s are re-
selling nearly 'half their interest
to other partners or. employees
and associates of Kennard Bros,
The other 84,850 ords. will be
placed with Were’s clients at
7s. 9d. each (including broker-
age and duties).
The 17-year-old hardware
wholesaling business of Ken-
nard’s was “built upon the con-
ception that retail traders in
hardware require facilities for
acquiring small quantities of
goods at frequent intervals.”
Turnover has steadily increased,
though manufacturing work
taken up during the war has
since been discontinued. Ad-
justed net profits quoted in the
memorandum of sale average
£13,282 over the last five terms
(after ordinary, but not undis-
tributed-profits, tax on a public
basis), with the separate figures
for 1947 and 1948 shown at
£18,726 and £22,707. The aver-
age figure would represent 18.8
p.c. on the new co.’s initial capi-
tal of £70,000, which will be
exactly covered by net tangible
assets in the books. Stocks
(£52,430) and debtors (£47,418)
make up most of gross assets.
Three of the Kennard brothers
remain as directors, and a fourth
will serve the co. as general
manager for five years. B.
Latham, a newcomer to the
board, is chairman.
Inflation is still a primary
concern of President Truman,
according to his annual address
to the nation. He is to ask Con-
gress for power to continue the
control of consumer credit, to
regulate commodity speculation,-
to control the direction of distri-
bution of scarce commodities, to
establish “stand - by” price-
ceilings where goods are scarce,
and to stimulate production,
where necessary, by Government
loans to the appropriate indus-
tries, Taxes, on corporation
earnings especially, are to be
raised, and social-security com-
mitments increased. It remains
to be seen whether the Truman
Budget embracing his “Fair
Deal” in itself makes any con-
tribution to the fight against in-
flation, or whether, as in the
past. Democrat budgeting con-
tinues to be one of the prime
causes of inflation in the U.S.A.
Unless the Budget is non-infla-
tionary, the rest of Mr. Tru-
man’s “controls” are likely to
be of no value.
=l= * * *
It appears that several coun-
tries are using sterling accumu-
lations to buy Australian wool,
and any base metals available
within the sterling area. By this
means some (sterling balances
have become indirectly con-
vertible into dollars.
* * * *
The Hollway Government will
consider abolition of price-
control in Victoria when
Cabinet meets on January 24.
The Premier says it is impossible
to keep prices in check without
subsidies, and these the Federal
Government has discontinued
since August, 1948, although still
levying the equivalent amount of
taxation, and giving Victoria a
particularly poor deal in the
redistribution of uniform in-
come tax. If price-control goes
m Victoria it may force other
States to follow suit. It is hard
to get sufficient staff to ad-
minister price - control under
State supervision.

Mackay, C.Q. sugar metro-

Blair Athol scheme. It has its

League, with Jack Mulherin,
now local chairman of the Steve-
doring Commission in the port,
"And never forget , son, it’s rude to point a gun
unless you're going to use it.”
supplying most of the publicity.
It is now claiming magnificent
coal deposits at Nebo, 70 miles
inland from the port; but most
of the claims, as published, can
be dismissed from serious con-
sideration. The drilling work is
being done under contract by
Hornibrooks, Ltd., for the Eng-
lish Electric Supply Corporation,
and results are not published, so
that the extraordinary claims
made are based on local leak-
ages from the field where dril-
ling is being done. In 1945
geologist J. H, Reid’s published
report on the matter stated that
the field appeared to have
potentialities, but that the seams
were non-proven. Last year T.
J. Hirst (now in England) and
Reid quietly visited the field
while they were reckoned to be
at Blair Athol. Operations to-
day are the result, and while
local reports indicate favorable
possibilities, no information has
been given out by the overseas
corporation.

The London-Cardiff firm of
Powell Duffryn Technical Ser-
vices, Ltd., may yet have
“Brisbane” added to its letter-
head. Since R. W. Foot toured
Australia the firm has become
well dug-in, and has three large
contracts that will keep it here
for years. Premier Hanlon gave
the co, its first job on Queens-
land’s coal deposits, mostly
as regards reserves, gradings
and mechanisation of output.
Premier Hollway has just signed
it on to foster the use of Vic-
torian brown coals, and in addi-
tion it is consultant to the Elec-
tric Supply Corporation and its
subsidiaries in connection with
the Blair Athol business.

GUNTAINO SAN AT HOME
By "EK DUM"
QUITE a number of Aus-
tralians had more than a
glimpse of him. Some
saw him a shadowy mark
through the sights of a rifle.
Some saw him in a shambling,
thin - shanked, khaki stream,
waddling behind the barbed-
wire, dipping into his rice with
relish. Some beheld him as a
shrieking monkey-man at close
quarters as he twisted nearly off
the proboscis he had commanded
them to push through the wire-
netting of the Outram-road jail
cell.
Others had a vision of him
filling them unnaturally from a
beaker by way of torture or ad-
ministering the log punishment
or sticking bamboo-chips under
other people’s fingernails.
But of all the postures in
which they saw him —hurtling
down on them as a kamikaze,
shooting wildly from a palm-
tree, beating them with a
bamboo or swinging a samurai
sword perilously near their necks
—the posture they liked him best
in was a recumbent one. The
deader he was the better they
preferred it.
Now all that is over. Gun-
taino San has gone home, if
alive, but he is still Guntaino
San. He still wears his uniform,
which has become more like an
antique than ever. He still sports
his curious but highly sensible
cap. But nobody would ever
imagine to look at him that he
would stick a bamboo-splinter
under your fingernail or settle
down seriously to remodel you
on the lines of Joe Wallis with a
kerosene-tin .full of water, a
funnel and a fence paling.
When you pass him h b takes
off his apology for a hat and
smiles broadly, bowing at the
same time from the waist with
such suddenness that you expect
to hear him crack in the middle.
If there is a gate or a door in
front of you he rushes to open
it. If you are impolite to him
he smiles ingratiatingly. If you
tell him to do anything he does
it —if you stand over him and
carefully direct his every move,
or if what you give him to do is
a familiar thing which it has
been his custom to do over and
over again.
When you see him in Japan —
that Japan which he has barbered
to an utter and inconceivable
civilised trimness, with not a
leaf out of place and nothing
uncultivated, including the
national manners you note
several things about him.
First, his numbers, which
mean that there is a surplusage
of him, and that he will therefore
work always at a cheap wage
and at the most remarkable
callings; next, his enterprise,
which has created the Gift Shop
Bernborough and more camera
emporiums to the square mile in
areas frequented by Australians
and Americans than in any other
place in the civilised world.
Then, his surprising ingenuity,
which enables him to take the
most finished optical products of
Germany and the United States,
and reproduce them with minute
accuracy and at a price about 50
per cent of the original.
You can /buy, in Japan today,
an almost exact replica of the
Zeiss Ikon camera, 3.5 lens,
coupled rangefinder and all com-
plete for about £lB sterling.
You can buy students’ micro-
scopes of a type which cost £l2
in Sydney for the equivalent of
£3 in Tokyo. You can buy sets
of drawing instruments which
would cost £lO here (if you
could get them) for the equiva-
lent of 30s.
You notice, more sharply than
in other peoples, the age division
of all the Guntaino Sans. There
are abundances of young ones
with shaven heads and ingratiat-
ing grins, as lively as grigs. There
are shoals of rising ones, polite,
but not so polite as their elders,
in the 15-year-old class. But in
the young-manhood range there
is a notable dearth, it being ap-
parent that they have preceded
General Tojo and his friends to
the hereafter.
The one portion of the race
which preserves what seem to be
normal age gradations are the
ladies, who are a race apart;
beautiful, equable, always smil-
ing and helpful.
In their kimonos, when they
wear them, they are the loveliest
of the world’s women, but rever-
sion to Western garb reveals that
below their exquisitely moulded
countenances they possess
underpinnings which would do
credit to a Dorrigo timber-getter.
Their knees are like the knees
of dinosaurs, and are fitted to a
shinbone like an oak-tree and a
foot which looks as if it may one
day become webbed. This is be-
cause nearly all Japanese
womenfolk and also all menfolk,
except the commercial classes,
serve an apprenticeship in the
ricefields.
Even the rich farmers work.
In the days of the Naval
Academy at Eta lima, officer
cadets always had a vacation in
the autumn so that they could
go home and help with the har-
vest amid the sucking mud of
the ricefields.
Especially the women work.
When you see the harvest in pro-
cess of consummation Poppa
San is usually on the ground en-
gaged in some skilled, sedentary
operation, while Momma San is
on her two underpinnings, occu-
pied with the really hard labor
of the moment. This apparently
is very good for her —and for
you, for it gives her strength
which is unequalled by any sen-
tient being of the same fighting
weight.
To see a delicious little fairy
about sft. nothing high, shell-
pink of cheek, flower-like of
form and apparently created
purely for decorative purposes,
suddenly spring into action, seize
a couple of suitcases weighing
perhaps 501 b. apiece, trot easily
down a wet garden-path with
them and heave them into a taxi-
cab is apt to give an Australian
palpitation. Really serious work
like coal-heaving and sleeper-
jostling is reserved for old ladies.
The first time you come across
the modern Guntaino San in
anything like quantity you are
apt to be a bit puzzled by him.
He is so sane in his mode of
living, dwelling in houses built
of paper which can be replaced
when somebody falls through
the wall, with only such furni-
ture and bedding as he can push
into a recess, that you are apt to
look on him as a marvel of com-
monsense. His surroundings are
so tasteful, his town-planning so
lovely—if not sanitary by West-
ern standards —his love of art in
construction and decoration, and
even in the pruning of his fruit-
trees displays itself so uni-
versally, that you mark him
down as the most cultured fel-
low on the average in the world.
But presently you begin to
notice strange things about him.
It begins to dawn on you pretty
soon that he is not an individual,
but merely part of a cluster. He
never seems to be guilty alone of
a complete action which is not
one of the most primitive sort.
It is as if, living sardine-like
with his fellows, he and his as-
sociates have become stuck to-
gether and have become incap-
able of completely separate
thought and action. Possibly this
is due to continual and rigid
military training. But the ob-
server has an uncanny feeling
that it is more than that, and the
strangeness of what you sense
among the hoi polloi is the more
remarkable because in the high-
est ranks of Japanese life, among
members of the Court and the
old ruling and higher commer-
cial classes, which are predomi-
nantly aristocratic in tradition,
most people seem to be indi-
viduals in the Western sense.
But among the lower clases,
who have a polish of manners
denied to Europeans and par-
ticularly the ruder orders of
Americans and Australians,
everything original seems to be
done by the combined intelli-
gence and will of the clusters,
through a process of trial and
error. Action with the ordinary
Japanese, unless new thoughts
are produced by the group, is
purely a matter of habit. Let us
take an example.
You are standing in the Ginza
near the corner of “W”-avenue
listening to the public wireless,
which is installed on every
corner, treating the conquered
inhabitants of Tokyo to five
minutes of “Stop y’r tickling,
Jock,” when a metallic clatter,
like that of an ungr,eased am-
munition-wagon bolting on a
steep hill, is heard in your im-
mediate rear.
You turn round and behold
a kurumaya san approaching.
He is a long, thin specimen. The
attenuated peak of his military

ABORIGINALITIES
“B. A. Ker”: Like a creek in flat
country the conversation had turned and
wandered ; it was on “surprise-packets”—
those mild-mannered little men sent by
Providence to humble aggressors—when
Peewee gave an instance: “Last time I
was in the Big Smoke a ‘blue’ started
just as I’d ducked in a pub for a drink.
Some big joker was goin’ crook on a
barmaid. She gave a bit of lip back;
then he did his block properly. If he
didn’t abuse her! I didn’t like it much ;
but he was about 14 stone, so I kidded
I didn’t hear. The bloke alongside me
was doin’ the same, until a little squirt
of a fellow put his beer down and walked
over. ‘Watch this,’ whispers the bloke,
giving me a nudge; ‘this little joker used
to be featherweight champion of the
Royal Navy.’ Tiny calmly walked up to
the big ’un and gave him a solid slap in
the middle of the back. Big ’un swung
’round with his eyes stickin’ out. The
little feller had to reach up to slap his
face, but he gave him a beaut—right on
the kisser. ‘That’ll teach you not to
swear at a lady,’ Tiny says. And then
it’s ‘on.’ Gripes, what a fight! D’you
ever see a bantam-rooster fightin’ a black
Orpington cockerel? Well, that’s what it
was like—only twice as savage. Tiny was
the best little fighter I ever saw —no
wonder Britannia ruled the waves when
they had him. And game! At the finish
he was bleeding from a cut over the left
eye; the other eye was shut; blood
poured from his nose and his teeth had
cut a great gash in his lip,” Peewee
paused, and Chica murmured admiringly:
“But he knocked the big bloke out, eh?”
Peewee looked surprised. “No,” he
drawled. “The big joker knocked him
as cold as a key.” The stunned silence
lasted until George protested: “But you
said he was the best little fighter you ever
saw.” “So he was,” Peewee admitted;
but a man can’t tell lies just to give a
yarn a moral. The big bloke was the
best big fighter I ever saw.”

“C.E.”; Mum sighed as the old bloke
dropped the lamb beside the doorstep.
“Another poddy f’r y* t’ look after,
Mum.” “The one we’ve got already,”
she complained, “drinks so much milk
that with this one, too, I won’t be able
to make any butter at all.” '“Better buy
it for a bit,” Dad suggested. “An’ I’ll
try an’ get a ton o’ chaff to help old
Dais along.” The milk supply increased
slightly, but the lambs’ demands re-
doubled. Soon they were drinking the
lot, while a weekly order to the store for
the tinned product supplied the house-
hold needs. One day about three months
later Mum was viciously chasing the
lambs out of the ruined vegetable patch
just as Dad came outside ready for the
town trip, “Call in and pay Mrs. Thomp-
son the three pounds twelve we owe her
for butter, will you, Dad?” she asked him.
“And pick up another six tins of milk.
These poddies are such a nuisance.”
“Never mind. Mum, I’ll wean ’em in a
couple more munce,” the old bloke en-
couraged. “Then y’ll have plenty o’
milk ’n’ things again. Don’t hurt us t’
manage, an’ we couldn’t let two good
lambs die, y’ know. Not at the price
they are. Gripes,” he chuckled, “if they
keep doin’ awright them lambs ’ll be
worth thirty bob each before long.”

“Bogaduck”; The abo. is often credited
with the ability to track over bare rock
such as a granite outcrop, but I’ve never
yet met one who could give a demonstra-
tion of it. Among many of the Centralian
tribes, on whose territories extensive
smooth rock outcrops are common, it
is expressly forbidden for young people
to walk on them. When I asked one of
the tribal elders the reason for the pro-
hibition he gave me a pitying look and
inquired how any blackfellow would know
what those youngsters got up to when
they were on such a smooth rock sur-
face, since there would be no tracks to
tell the story. Had a mate who, know-
ing the seriousness with which the native
interprets footprints, went from bush to
bush, doing a different dance-step behind
each. When they inquired what he had
been doing to leave such queer tracks,
he gave them a blank look and replied
that he had done nothing unusual. They
weren’t satisfied, and for days after they
held long conferences, one rising at in-
tervals to do what he thought the white-
feller must have done, while the rest
looked at the marks left by his feet and
criticised his deductions. The elders of
that Mann Range tribe are probably still
trying to make sense of it.

“Anon”: We were sinking an artesian-
bore near Eromanga (W.Q.), and a school
of jackasses chose an overhanging limb
near by for their dormitory. The cook
used to throw the scraps where the jacks
could pick them up, and gradually the
birds cobbered-up with us. They had
their usual laugh morning and evening,
and during the daytime two semi-tame
bower-birds would mimic them to per-
fection, though on a much lower key.
We were working two shifts from day-
light until about 11 p.m., and my job was
to get up steam about 4 a.m. for the first
shift. When dawn appeared I used to
blow the whistle to rouse out the day
gang, and immediately after the jacks
would have their first laugh. Wondering
how the birds knew when daylight was
approaching, especially on a cloudy
“Quick, constable, DO something — it's our human fly
sleep-walking again!"
morning when the moon was full, I de-
cided to try them with an experiment.
Choosing a cloudy night when I was alone
in camp and the moon was at its brightest
I kept sufficient pressure in the boiler, and
at about 2 a.m. I went through the usual
procedure of lighting the lamps, shaking
up the galley-fire and blowing out a
quantity of water from the boiler to get
rid of scum that would settle during idle
hours. Then, getting a break in the clouds
to the east, I blew an extra long blast.
Immediately there was movement in the
line of jacks and then came the concerted
cachinnation.

“K.V.”: With Aunt Aggie there were
two ways of doing anything—-her way
and the wrong way ; but I still think there
was something I didn’t quite get the day
she churned the cream. Mum had been
beating it for an’ hour and Dad had a
go till he reckoned his arm was numb
from the shoulder down when Aunt
Aggie took over. In about two minutes
there was the butter made. Putting the
basin triumphantly on the table before
us she smiled tolerantly and remarked:
“There is a right way to do everything!”

“Jamboon”; Having spent all my life
working among timber, I would like
“South Land” (B. 15/12/’4B) to name
any species of tree which harbors witch-
ery grubs and which provides a “silent
harvest of centuries” to be destroyed
when you get the grubs. Up here in
North Queensland when we want grubs
for bait—and don’t the freshwater fish
love ’em!—we get them from three
sources: (1) Fallen limbs of candlenut or
milky-pine in the rain forest; (2) gum-
trees in the open forest, where we use
the barbed tendrils of the lawyer-cane
to haul the grubs from the tunnels which
they are boring into the wood; (3) small
and commercially useless wattles of the
underbrush, which take only a few years
to grow and in which the sign of grub
infestation is a crooked growth and an
unhealthy look. As a matter of fact, any
wattle which has the grubs in it is soon
killed by them, so the man who smashes
one up to get bait is only hurrying its
fate. Local bushmen, familiar with con-
ditions in other parts of the continent,
say that these things hold good in the
case of wattles anywhere, even in places
as far away as the jarrah country in W.A.
or the Tasmanian forests. If “S.L.”
wants to declare war on witchetty hunters
he’d better start on the black cockatoo,
as this bird takes 10,000 grubs for
every one secured by a human being, but
I warn him that he’ll have the Forestry
people up in arms if he does. They re-
gard the way in which the cocky takes
grubs from living trees as a most useful
factor in keeping timber sound and
healthy.

“Chuck”: Buzzer halted the store-
keeper’s apologies with a bang on the
counter. “Aw, v fgot, me big fat aunt!”
he exploded. “I told y’ to send me three
tins, an’ now y’ ain’t even kept ’em.
YTe as bad as the silly cow in the post-
office, an’ that idiot at the fact’ry that
never knows what he’s doin’.” Ten
minutes later Buzzer strode heavily into
the garage. “A man can’t depend on any-
body these days, Tom,” he unburdened
himself to the proprietor. “No good
, .
tenin em t’ do anything. Gripes, they
don’t even listen, if y’ ask me. Thinkin’
o’ somethin’ else ’stead o’ tending to one
thing at a time. Just when I’m busy, too.
Got t’ drive out to the Ten-mile before
dinner and me brakes won’t work. Take
a look at em, will y’, Tom?” The garage
bloke strode to the door and glanced all
round. Right. But where’s your car,
Buzz. The other joined him and stared
m turn at the empty space outside,
buzz s eyes roamed up and down the
road, then turned to take in his dusty
boots. J” 6 . 1, ~~ He scowled per-
Gripes, Tom, I s’pose y’ didn’t

• It ,-c cf* J ,
min ? ek k ■ drißcuJt t° deter-
mine where the vegetable kingdom ends
and the animal kingdom begins with
certain primitive types. For instance, in
volvocina and related minute protozoa we
find a strange ambiguity; for although
apparently animals, they absorb light-rays
by means of masses of green, yellow or
brownish granules in their body-
substance, thus effecting the transforma-
tion of inorganic matter into organic
nutrient material, a process similar to
# that brought about by the presence of
leaf-green in plants. The insectivorous
sundews and the sensitive mimosas can
move their leaves, while many micro-
scopic diatoms enclosed in siliceous hi-
u VC . sbeds bave or B a ns of locomotion,
though others resemble miniature sea-
weeds. Conversely, creatures such as
corals, colonial hydrozoa and some sea-
quirts at an early stage become as
stationary as plants, and sometimes even
look like them. Notably some tunicates
have a thick covering of a substance in-
distinguishable from cellulose, a typical
plant material.
• * * *
“Betcha”: Possums probably prefer
tree-hollows for homes, but when these
aren’t easily available they accept substi-
tutes readily enough. In a corner of the
home paddock, where hollow trees are
scarce, they live mostly in the rocks. Old
rabbit-burrows, cracks, root-holes, any-
thing that gives an opening into the cool
spaces beneath the big piles of granite
are used for entrances. Coming out
nightly to feed, the colony has been there
as long as I can remember. It has multi-
plied and presents no trouble except at
trapping time, when it is necessary to go
after the few rabbits that invade the area.
Most of the silver-grey blokes sit quietly
in the traps, and sometimes one finds
them asleep there, front mitts curled over
their mugs. It is the very strong traps,
and the possum that fights, that thin the
ranks. Killing a sheep or beast, stretching
the necks of rabbits or dispatching a
snake is all in the week’s routine; but
somehow a bloke hates himself when he
has to bash a possum.

“Col’s Cobber”: Col’s nerves had been
affected by the war, and he always con-
trived to have company. One night we
sat on either side of a dimly-burning belar
fire in silent communion. Col’s hands
were cupped about his, ears as he rested
his jaw on the palms, staring into the
coals. Suddenly I cleared my throat.
Col started violently and spun around ;
seeing nobody he peered to either side
in the gloom, and then, looking puzzled,
back at me. “Did you cough?” he
asked. I nodded. Satisfied, he resumed
his seat, his posture and his ruminating.
Followed a moment’s silence, then:
“Good job I wasn’t on me own,” he said.

“Taswegian”: I think “Olive Willey”
(B, 22/12/’4B) has misread the paragraph
she quoted from E. V. Timms’s Forever
to Remain : “But the glory of the bush
had faded ; winter was coming, and the
scented blossoms of creepers, trees and
plants had fallen and withered. Another
spring and summer must come before
nature presented once again the fragrance
and splendor of the wildflowers.” Some
of W.A.’s wildflowers bloom in the winter
(holly-leaved hovea is one), but most
bloom either in the spring or the summer.
Some of those which wait until summer
are the Christmas-tree, white marianthus,
white - flowered billardiera, elegant
pronaya and Morrison feather-flower.
And many that bloom in the spring last
through summer, and others that bloom
most of the year (scarlet feather-flower
is one) are most conspicuous in summer.
And isn’t this just what Timms says,
that spring and summer must come
before we see the full splendor of the
wildflowers again? “0.W.” writes as
though Timms had said “Another spring
and summer must g 0.... ”

“Solitude”: Seventyfiver had been
rather quiet lately, and, suspecting rheu-
matics or a brainwave, I let the trouble
develop unprompted. Even when I came
on him eyeing the hill at the back as
though he’d never noticed 'it there be-
fore, I remarked casually on the weather
and passed on. Further, an ancient copy
of a country journal rose to an unusual
height of popularity, and nightly he
studied it, and smoked in what, on those
occasions, passed for silence. The crisis
came the morning he caught his nag for
the town trip. “There’s a sawmill opened
up forty miles down the road, Sol,” he
remarked. I waited suspiciously. “Lot
o’ money, they tell me, to be made out o’
timber, with them things around.” He
buckled the girth and surveyed the back
hill over the top of his saddle. “Been
thinkin’ I might order some good tree
seeds an’ sow down that hill,” he went
on. “Wha-a-at!” I glanced towards the
many thousand acres of forest land. “Aw,
not that sort o’ timber,” he scowled at
me. “I thought o’ pines f’r a quick turn-
over, with a good belt o’ mahogany or—
er—oaks or somethin’ f’r the.main crop.
Man’d make a forchm ”

“Baldy”: Ran into my neighbor with
his utility-truck bogged through trying to
pull a cow (which had been dead some
days) home for his fowls. I hooked on
to pull him out and soon was bogged
worse than he. So we walked back to
his place for his other truck of early-
’2o vintage, and after putting on a wheel,
pumping tyres and turning the crank-
handle for long spells, we got it going
and rattled back to the utilities. No go.
Next day, after bolting on the radiator
and a couple of spark-plugs and twitch-
ing up some other parts of the old tractor
with fencing-wire, we eventually pulled
both utilities clear of the bog. On going
back to survey the scene, with the air
thick with the odor of the disintegrating
bovine. Whiskers said, “Well, I think I’ll
pull the cow home now before it goes
bad! ”
YARRA TRACK.
Rutted and broken and wagon-wheel torn,
Winding and climbing past gully-beds, worn
Deep in the rocks by water and time,
Up, ever up, the Five-Mile we climb.
Bare, windswept Matlock, forgotten and lone,
Dotted with mine-shafts and quartz-speckled
stone:
Broken-down fencing, slab-boarded shack,
Guarding the peace of the old Yarra Track.
Far down below through the heat-haze appears
Shimmer of roof-tops red-rusted with years;
Sun-dappled Goulburn, a ribbon-like streak,
Merging its way with the Morning Star Creek.
Down past the graveyard with weeds overgrown;
Weatherworn records on rain-polished stone;
Blue-gum and grey-gum, heat-scorched and
black,
Border the edge of the old Yarra Track.

“Hanko”: The: church was decorated
with wisps of oaten and wheaten hay ,
the parson had intoned lengthily of the
“bounteous harvest,” and now the organ
rumbled and the choir burst into “Bring-
ing in the Sheaves.” The boss awakened
with a start. Absently he reached out
and plucked a few heads from a sheaf
in the aisle. , He rubbed out the gram
and winnowed it by a mighty puffing
that flirted the huskings about the neck
of Mrs. Buxom. That lady scrubbed at
her nape with a tiny hankie, then turned
to glare furiously. But. the trump was
quite oblivious of it, for he was studying
the wheat. “Federation,” he said. An
shrivelled, too, if y’ ask me.” I nudged
him sharply, grimaced and shook my
head, but he was still sleep-dazed.
“What’s matter?” he said loudly, and
then: “Fancy sowin’ Federation these
days!” Interruption came with the col-
lection-plate. The boss shot, his fistful
of burdensome grain into the plate
gratefully. “Thanks, mate,” he said. He
turned to me. “See that bloke with the
ash-tray? Well, that’s old Buggins the
ironmonger, all dolled up like a sore toe.
At that I grabbed my cady and left what
was left of Harvest Festival right there
and right then.

“Lower Tops’!”: “Tasmaniac’s” men-
tion of the now-almost-extinct Tasmanian
tiger (B. 15/12/’4B) recalls that a week or
so ago fresh tracks of one of these carni-
vorous marsupials were reported by Mr.
H. E. Wolley, a Glen Huon bushman at
Bermuda, in the Huon Valley. Mr.
Wolley has tracked the tiger around the
same locality for two winters. The last
one seen was in May, 1947,,when Messrs.
A. A. Wolley and B. Thorpe were clearing
a power-line over the range between the
Russell and Denison Valleys, and a
“grizzly grey” animal, intent on following
a wallaby, passed within 20 yards of them.
The marsupials reputedly won’t attack
humans, but I’m not so sure. As a boy
at Port Davey I was ashore cutting fire-
wood for a ketch when my mate, beside
me, let out a yell. I looked round in time
to see him swiping with his axe at a tiger
which was standing behind him. On
examination we found the poor brute had
had nothing to eat for days. Incidentally,
the only other Tasmanian tiger I saw ;
believe it or not, was wandering down a
thoroughfare in Hobart 25 years ago.
Some ass had let him, along with all other
animals, out of the Zoo!

“J.J.A.”: Tell “Moujik” (B. 15/12/’4B)
that the wheat found by archaeologists is
not only dead, but also carbonised. The
hydrocarbons break up over the course of
the years in much the same way as coal
is formed. Thus, besides the germ being
dead, the food stored for the young plant
has been destroyed.. Samples of wheat
on exhibition in the Australian Institute
of Archaeology look as if they had been
scorched in an ovefi, but tests show that
this wheat-was undamaged by fire. The
condition is caused by the natural process
of time. Yet the wheat from the Pyramids
must be 2000 years older than these
samples, which came from Jericho,
destroyed 1400 b.c.

“Jamahat”: On the road from Jonda-
ryan to Cecil Plains (Q.) I noticed an
eaglehawk hovering over something red
on the ground. The hawk landed and
started waddling across to this red blot
on the ground. At about 2ft. from the
spot there appeared a red streak and then
a shower of feathers. I stopped the truck
and went to investigate. The fox had
the eagle by the back of the neck. As I
approached the red fellow remembered
he had an appointment elsewhere. About
20 yards from the dead bird I came across
another patch of hawk-feathers and
bones, apparently the earlier victim of
the cunning one’s combined powers of
deception and speed.

“Mat’s Mate”: After a couple of drinks
at the Locomotive Hotel in Junee I
missed Mat, so stepped to the street and
looked up and down. A bleached old
chap leant against the pub and I asked
him, “You see anythin’ of a big cove in
a blue suit come out here?” “Yair,” he
said. “He come to the door and a couple
of girls was goin’ past an’ spoke to him
an’ he went off with ’em, down that way.”
“That couldn’t ha’ bin him,” I said.
“Only bloke I see,” was the retort.
Doubting my senses I went along the
street. No sign of Mat. A young cove
said he’d seen a big chap with two girls
going into a garage. “Gripes,” I muttered,
heading that way. The garageman said
they’d gone five minutes before. Not
sure whether the big fellow had suddenly
gone crazy or been kidnapped I looked all
over the place, without success. Presently
“’ Bye , dear, and don't forget to drop in at the butcher's
on the Way home."
I drifted back to the Locomotive. He was
in the bar. “Where you bin?” he de-
manded. “Lookin’ for you,” I said.
“What became of the girls?” He gaped
at me. I told him what I’d heard. When
he recovered he said in a low voice: “I
only popped down the back. That’s the
nearest you ever bin t’ gettin’ cracked
from me. Couple o’ girls! Gripes, y’
must be drunk t’ go on like that.” And,
decidedly shocked at the bare idea, he
called for another drink. '

“Vamac”: Was with a big droving
outfit taking cattle from Queensland to
Adelaide and, near the Murray, had just
salted down a beast for tucker when two
swaggies mooched up and asked if I could
spare a bit of fresh beef. Queer-looking
pair they were —sort of giant-and-dwarf
touch. The little cove did most of the
talking while his cobber kept glancing
nervously this way and that, I said
“Sorry, mate, I’ve just pickled everything
but the fry. But here’s a nice bit of skirt,
if that’s any good to you.” At that the
big cove just turned and bolted for the
mulga, and the little fellow meekly and
rather shamefacedly picked up both swags
and trudged after him without a word
and without the meat. I never saw them
again, but I’ve often wondered who they
were.

“Old-timer”: Jim Fanning isn’t so
pleased with the motor that has replaced

his sulky and horse. “Yairs,” he said

morosely at the car—“y’ rip straight

“J.1.A.”; The slumbering dogs of the
township moved from their resting-places
in the dust as, headed for the river road,
old Paddy’s bullock-wagon lumbered
down the main street. His tarpaulin-
covered load aroused the curiosity of the
town’s human watchdogs leaning on the
pub verandah. “What’s the load, Paddy?”
someone asked. The reply, “Christmas
cheer for Blank” (the meanest squatter
in the district), caused a sensation, and to
a man they moved out to see for them-
selves. Paddy lifted the tarpaulin to show
them: barbed-wire and Weed-poison.

“Bo”: Mac, reputedly the hardest
horse-dealer west of the Great Divide,
had unloaded some of the worst-con-
ditioned lot of ancients he’d ever handled
on to a come-on at a figure that spoke
volumes for Mac’s powers of persuasion.
As he was still wondering whether they
were destined for the zoo or the horse-
meat market the buyer intimated to Mac
that in the circumstances it would not
exactly be inappropriate if the vendor
were to shout, Mac had seen the buyer
in the pub, and, remembering that he had
soaked up double-headers, the horse-
dealer made a rapid calculation and made
his decision. “Weelhe said cautiously,
“Ah haen’t the time to go to yon pooh
wi’ ye noo, but ah’ll tell ye what —I’ll gi’e
ye anither horse instead!”

While we were manning
the Thermopylae Pass in Greece Jerry
made it so hot that transport down to
our positions by vehicle was impossible,
so we used donkeys loaned us by the
Greek Army. Those donks did a great
job of work, but they sometimes jacked
up on us. Every time one Digger pulled
on the reins his donk went down on its
knees. At last, in desperation, the Digger
stepped back, gazed at his charge and
said bitterly: “Go on, you long-faced
blankard, pray! ‘God bless mother, God
bless father, and make me a good little
donk’!”

“Zake”; Old Ned, who had pitched his
camp on the edge of the swamp, was
always complaining about the snakes. “I
kill about a dozen blacks an’ browns
every day,” he said. “And I’m alwiz
bootin’ ’em out o’ me bunk before I turn
in at night. They’re somethin’ crool.”
“Well, you can easily fix that,” I con-
tended. “Shift your camp up the hill —it’s
cleared ground, and the snakes won t
leave the swamp while they’ve got all
these frogs here.” “That’s just it,” said
Ned earnestly. “The frogs, I mean. The
only way I can get to sleep is to be
soothed to it by their chorus, so I just
gotter put up with the wrigglers.”

“Rocky T.”: Big Joe, the cane-tram-
line ganger, used to bolt his midday lunch
and promptly sink into stertorous
slumber, waking promptly on the cheep
of the distant mill whistle. It seemed
strange to me that he should hear it
with the wind blowing away from us,
when it took ear-stretching and a boy-
proof-watch check to enlighten us. Then
I woke up; I deduced that the gang all
went silent at “blow-up” so that “Joe”
might sleep on for a while ; it was in this
silence after the usual post-prandial argu-
ments that allowed him to just hear
the whistle. The day after the solution
dawned on me I got the mob to keep
arguing on till half an hour had been
gained, when something subconscious
told Joe to wake; he did, with a bellow.
Thereafter he brought his Big Ben in a
billycan.

“Zarkov”: A newcomer, complaining
about the numerous rats which overran
the crib-room on 54 level at the Mt.
Morgan mine, described them as “big as
flamin’ cats.” “Gaw on! ” snorted an old
hand. “The things running around here
these days are only insecks. You oughter
seen what they were like years ago. One
night we were having ‘crib’ back along
that old drive when we were disturbed by
the sound of something dragging a heavy
piece of timber. A mate and myself went
to investigate, and found a ruddy great
rat snigging a lump of nine by nine off
a couple of stale crusts.”

“R.A.A. Sargent”: I take it that
when “Young Slim’s” father told his hack
to “whoa” (B. 29/12/’4B) he was wearing
a 10-gallon hat, hairy pants, check shirt,
high-heeled boots (with fancy tops) and
was toting a “guitar” on his back and a
red bandana round his throat, as I under-
stand this is the garb most favored by
George-street boundary-riders on their
dude-ranch holidays. He’d probably have
stopped the nag if he’d taken a gentle
pressure on both reins. In my experience
“whoa” has been used only on harness
horses, and not too often then. Will ad-
mit I did strike one peculiarly-broken
colt —he’d stand like a lamb if mounted
from the off, but was a devil incarnate
when mounted in the normal manner.
His owner cleaned up from the local
horsemen and moved on to the next pub
when the boys woke up.

“Bungle”: There wasn’t a tradesman
in the town who didn’t have his knife
into old Gunga Singh. Although it was
well known that the Ghan had made a
good thing out of his market garden, he
invariably took months to settle his bills.
The general opinion was that the old
vagabond had a tidy fortune buried about
his place. It was the exasperated store-
keeper who finally brought Gunga to
heel. Turning angrily after |he usual
session of vague evasions, he ’barked a
warning over his shoulder. “Well, you
can take it from me, Gunga Singh, if
that money doesn’t come along in the
morning, I’ll be right up there tomorrow
night, digging!” Neft day the account
was settled.

“Übet”: In a recent nature broadcast
an expert expressed surprise on hearing
of a magpie’s nest built of wire in place
of the usual stick-and-twig structure.
Anyone who lives around with Maggie
knows that, like everyone else nowadays,
she builds with whatever she can get.
After a telephone-line alteration I dis-
covered a magpie’s nest near by made
almost entirely of thin wire. A tangled
arrangement, certainly, but with nothing
but a beak and a couple of feet for tools
not many could have done better. Then,
after a hay-feeding winter, one maggie’s
nest consisted of nothing but hay-band.
Another I saw had several rubber-rings
worked into its walls. Mag is the pro-
gressive type, bent on improvement, and
quickly appraises the value of what she
finds. I salute her ingenuity while de-
ploring the pied one’s sense of honesty.
AWAKE.

Walking over the creak in the stair,
SpOTgfng the mind from this old, stifled house.

Grown sudden long, and jungle-soft, and damp.

Broken about the edges of the pool;

Of the gulf where sleep will drown me, now,
But l what F was that darkness on the creaking

GRAZCOS."
When to Inbreed.
“Q.Z.T.”: A problem which
often faces the stockowner is
how close to breed to any par-
ticular strain. The value of in-
breeding is only realised when
the sire whose progeny has
proved to be well above the
standard of their dams and well
above the breed average is him-
self bred close to the strain
which it is desired to perpetu-
ate. Such a sire is valuable, and
close breeding to his bloodlines
is desirable. When a sire pro-
duces only progeny with aver-
age production and not above
breed average an outcross from
some better strain should be in-
troduced.
No breeder whose herd is be-
low the breed-average in pro-
duction should attempt any
form of inbreeding. The policy
for him to follow would be to
introduce good blood from
proved sources and then, when a
high standard has been reached,
to intensify the good blood by
breeding along close lines.
Culling is a strong necessity
when commencing to inbreed,
and mating must be very care-
fully handled. Only those indi-
viduals which show strong re-
semblance genetically to the
ideal of the breed should be bred
from, and in dairy females the
butterfat test and total butter-
fat production should be well
above average. Too much stress
can be laid on type and appear-
ance, to the detriment of the
good producer.
The motto for the dairy-
farmer: “Feed well, test always
.and cull deeply.” If this be done
the breeder has a true founda-
tion on which to work, and he
cannot fail to do well.
High Merino Lambings.
“Archaps”; During the last
five years on Noondoo Station,
Dirranbandi (Q.), lambings have
averaged 116 per cent., mainly by
applying the findings of Drs.
Gunn and Kelley, of the C.S.I.R.
Over a period of years normal
lambing in flock sheep on
Noondoo was about 80 to 90
per cent., but stud sheep over
the same period averaged only
about 70 per cent. Over half a
million surplus sheep have been
delivered off the property in the
last 12 years.
This year maiden ewes
dropped 107 p.c. lambs, and
the improvement is con-
sidered to be due to some cause
other than chance. The man-
agement of the ewes has not
been changed; they have had
no artificial feed, either prior to
or during the service period, but
they have always been given feed
for lambing. In 1946, perhaps
the driest year ever known in
the district, the drop was 1131
p.c. But the rams have been
given more attention recently
than hitherto, in an attempt to
apply Dr. Gunn’s findings, and
this is regarded as the reason for
the improved results. It has
been shown that fertility in rams
is quite independent of their
general wellbeing; a ram can
be fighting fit and willing to
work vigorously, but be incap-
able of getting lambs. Dr. Gunn
has shown that fresh green grass
contains what is required for re-
storing maximum fertility; short
feed in the ram paddock, where
practicable, appears to be desir-
able. On the question of an ex-
amination for fertility of young
rams, the manager of Noondoo
(Euston Young) is doubtful,
after an experience with large
numbers of single-mated rams
over a long period, if there
would be any worth-while gain ;
no infertile ram has yet been
found on Noondoo, though
some get more lambs than
others, due, probably, to bad
management. It is thought that
some strains of Merinos may be
more fertile than others, but such
differences between* strains are
not likely to be large.
Young does not doubt lamb-
ing percentages can be improved
by better management, particu-
larly in consistency, and believes
that seasonal conditions are not
responsible for disappointing re-
sults to anything like the extent
hitherto assumed. Young, on
his experience, says it seems
highly desirable that the whole
matter should be closely investi-
gated.
Preparing Show Poultry.
“K.T.”: It takes about six
weeks. A coop 36in. x 30in, is
suitable. During the first two
weeks of penning the birds
generally go off in condition, but
at the end of six weeks should
be in the “pink.” Birds should
not be handled during the first
week. For the remaining weeks
they should be taught to stand
properly as they would before
the judge ; if wild they should
be quietened. No judge wants
to handle a wild bird or one with
vermin omit.
A white bird should be
washed. Never send a dirty bird
to a show. Dirty birds cast re-
flections on the exhibitor. Three
tubs of water are needed, with
plenty of towels. Most recom-
mend the white castile type of
soap; I personally employ a re-
liable soap-powder.
The first tub should be com-
fortably hot. When it is correct
the bird should be plunged in
over the head to start with and
then, holding its head above
water, wash until all traces of
dirt are gone. The second tub is
the rinsing water, used to wash
off remaining soap. The third
and final bath should remove
the last trace of dirt. It may
contain a little laundry blue,
care being taken to have the
water no darker than a light
sky blue. Then as much of the
water as possible should be
stroked out of the feathers,
which can then be wiped with
towels.
Next the bird is placed in a
drying coop, either before a
stove or in the sun, but care
“ Cripes! Cant you plough straight , Map”
should be taken that the sun does
not strike the lobe. The coop
contains clean straw or any-
thing which will avoid dirt and
dust. If any soap is left in the
feathers the job will be a failure.
The last wash should be a couple
of days before the exhibition, so
that the bird will have sufficient
time to preen its feathers.
There is no special need to
wash colored fowls; it may
improve blacks, though not
buffs, as they are likely to show
mealiness. Washed or not, it is
necessary for all show entrants
to have their faces, combs and
legs cleaned. Vinegar and olive-
ojl (equal parts) is beneficial.
Olive-oil is best for the legs. Be
sure to wipe oil from the legs.
Never attempt to fake a bird.
It will catch up on you sooner
or later. A good judge spots a
fake at once. Don’t send the
birds to show in too-small
crates, risking a disappointment
after all the preparation.
Banding for Codlin-moth.
“Mr,”: The bag band attracts
more grubs than the chemically-
treated * type, being cosy and
affording more cover. Regular
inspections are necessary, of
course, but they provide an op-
portunity to inspect each tree
for alternative lurking-places of
the grub (loose bark, forks, etc.).
Best results are obtained if the
band is in position before the
end of November. Drive a nail
into the tree to hold one end of
a 4in. strip of hessian or sacking
folded over to provide extra
cover. Take this round the trunk
and slip it over the nail-head,
with the ends slightly over-
lapping.
A Calving Disorder.
“Prof.”: Known as aceto-
naemia, it has been causing
trouble in dairy herds in this
S.A, district over the past three
years. Associated with milk-
fever, the first symptoms are
failure by the affected animal to
respond to recognised treat-
ments for milk-fever. The cow
appears to partially recover, but
cannot be g’ot back on its feet,
usually lingering on for a num-
ber of days, when it may eventu-
ally die —constipation and drop
in milk yield are characteristic
symptoms.
The practice here is to inject
any cows showing signs of milk-
fever (swaying gait—going down
and eventually lying on side one
or two days after calving) with
a mixture of 4oz. of calcium
borogluconate and 6oz. of glu-
cose in li pints (three cups) of
warm water. W. Stephen Smith
(veterinary officer), in the S.A.
“Journal of Agriculture,” reports
that the condition may also
occur between the second and
sixth week after calving, associ-
ated with grass-tetany, a dis-
order caused by a drop of mag-
nesium in the blood. Solutions
of 2oz. of Epsom salts and 6oz.
of glucose in 2% cups of warm
water are recommended.
A Grand Coastal Pasture.
“He-ne”: Berseem, or
Egyptian clover, is a valuable
winter and spring fodder-crop
along the east coast, particularly
in the N.S.W. Hunter Valley.
Some Berseem plots sown on
river flats last March provided
four good cuts during winter
and spring. Farmers now call it
“winter lucerne,”
Berseem does best on the
heavy loams, but grows quite
well on lighter soils. Ground
should be well cultivated before
the seed is sown at the end of
February or early March. If
sown later than mid-March fod-
der yields are apt to be reduced.
Sow at the rate of 121 b. to 151 b.
per acre, then harrow lightly in.
It makes a splendid fodder,
either green or as hay, for milk-
ing cows, but it is advisable to
feed green Berseem after milk-
ing -to avoid any milk taint,
although it imparts no more
taint than green lucerne.
Combating Stinkwort.
“Needle Ned”: Though not
actually poisonous to stock, it is
liable to produce irritation and
inflammation in the digestive
organs (of sheep especially), thus
laying the system open to bac-
teria already present and eventu-
ally causing death. Even small
quantities taken by cows spoil
milk and butter. It is not usually
troublesome on land which is
regularly cropped or on land
which is completely uncultivated,
but appears to favor that
cropped at irregular intervals
and seldom manured.
As it appears in stubble in its
early stages, it is readily eaten by
stock, so graze heavily immedi-
ately after harvest, thus prevent-
ing a dense growth. It should
not be allowed to form seed.
Small patches should be hand-
pulled and burnt. Wear gloves
to avoid dermatitis.
Pig Litters.
“Myrrhee”; Small litters are
a major reason why many pig-
raisers are going out of business,
because the overhead cost per
pig then becomes unduly high.
The trouble can be avoided,
thus: (1) Select a brood sow on
her parents’ production records ;
(2) feed her an adequate and
complete diet; (3) change the
sow after she has reared five or
six litters —most are on the
down-grade by then. First
obvious signs of deterioration
appear in the udders.
After having weaned her litter
a sow should be fed to improve
in condition so that she’s fat, yet
not too fat, just before mating.
Keep her in that condition until
she farrows, which is 112 days
after conception.
Daily food requirements of a
sow suckling a full-sized litter
are a gallon of separated milk ;
as much pasture or cut green-
stuff as she will eat; as much
ground limestone and salt (4-1
mixture) as she desires —usually
about 20z,, and, beginning the
day after she farrows, 41b. of,
cereals (barley, wheat or pol-
lard), gradually increasing the
quantities until the appetite is
satisfied. This will mean 61b, to
81b. of cereals per day, plus -Üb.
for each piglet she is suckling.
Feed either in a trough three
times a day or in a self-feeder
available at all times.
To help the suckers make
rapid weight and to prepare
them for the changeover in diet
at weaning use supplementary
feed in creeps. Fill one trough
with a mixture of four parts of
cereal-meal and one part of
meat-meal; in another put water
or separated milk. If milk is fed
the meat-meal can be dispensed
with. To supply the family’s
iron requirements throw in a
shovelful of fresh earth each
day.
A Rustless Bencubbin ?

Heliotrope a Poison Plant.
“C.S.”: That’s what the
C.S.I.R. says after looking into
outbreaks of a form of so-called
toxaemic jaundice in sheep in
N.S.W. and Victoria over the
past 20 years. Losses have
amounted to 50 p.c. in some
flocks and have caused dis-
organisation of the fat-lamb in-
dustry in Southern Riverina.
Most of these deaths have been
caused by feeding on heliotrope,
particularly when the plant has
been grazed for two or more
consecutive years.
Heliotrope poisoning has not
been recognised before mainly
because deaths occur months
after the plant has disappeared
from the pasture. An obvious
control measure is to prevent
sheep from grazing on helio-
trope. Unfortunately, this is not
always possible, particularly in
areas where rainfall is insuffi-
cient to permit the establishment
of improved pastures. Usually
sheep will not eat heliotrope if
other green plants are available
in the pasture.
Research is now to be under-
taken into methods of control-
ling and eradicating the weed.
Unless it can be brought under
control the fat-lamb industry
will suffer seriously.
Mulga in Queensland.
“Bill C.”: Discussing the
mulga scrubs in inland Queens-
land at field days in the
Warrego, botanist S. L. Everist
warned that mulga was very
vulnerable to improper handling.
The low or sheep mulga grows
in stands containing as many as
5000 trees to the acre. The
middle shoots of these trees
were chopped out by axemen,
leaving the branches all low.
These trees could be kept down
by allowing cattle at them at one
time and sheep at another.
Whipstick mulga grew less
densely, between 2000 and 3000
trees occupying an acre. This
variety shot up and stock could
not reach the tops. Umbrella
mulga was less dense again, but
its yield of leaves was good, and
sheep liked it. It was wise to
leave about two of the bottom
branches when cutting this
variety for feed. Stock could
not reach the foliage of tall
mulga trees, which had to be
felled. They were not heavy
yielders, but stock would eat the
leaves.
None of the mulga trees
yielded much feed for stock, but
the foliage compared favorably
with lucerne-hay in food value.
The trees regenerated them-
selves by seedlings, which ap-
peared after the late summer
rains and which thrived if
winter rains followed. Heavy
stocking would destroy the
seedlings.
Everist suggested that the
rolling of whipstick mulga be
done across the slopes, and that
sections of the stands be left
unrolled to facilitate seed-distri-
bution. The rolling was most
satisfactory when two tractors
advanced on a parallel course
with a stout wire rope connect-
ing them.
Hints for the Farm.
“Bilberry”; The testa does
not rot before a seed germinates
(B. 22/12/’4B). Water is essential
for germination, but it is taken
up by the embryo through a
small hole (the micropyle, if we
must be technical). The embryo
then swells, begins to grow and
splits open the testa. The testa
of some seeds like the broad-
bean splits irregularly. In other
cases, such as the melon, it splits
in a regular manner, resembling
a cockle. Incidentally, the testa
of the bean is left in the ground,
surrounding the seed leaves ; the
testa of the melon is carried up
above the soil before the young
seed leaves finally force it off.
Examine this testa —it has not
rotted but has merely been split
open.
“C.A.A.”: When preparing a
bed for cucumbers (which may
be sown now) space the hills
three to four feet apart and
work in some organic manure,
with loz. of blood-and-bone to
each hill. If immature fruit is
picked 48 hours before setting
(for pickling as gherkins) later
yields will be heavier. Pending
pickling cucumbers can be
stored in brine made from ilb.
of salt to a gallon of water.
“Bill C.”: Japanese Kudzu-
vine was first established on the
S.Q. coast many years ago, but
has not greatly impressed dairy-
men. However, the plant’s great
virtue lies in its high protein
content, a vital factor when it is
realised that most grasses be-
come very low in protein when
mature and dry. Another Jap
plant, Puero, is under trial at the
South Johnstone (N.Q.) Experi-
ment Station, but little has been
heard about it except that it
succeeds when sown with Para-
grass.
“C.A.A.”: Average incubation
periods of various domestic
birds are; Bantams, (different
breeds) 17 to 21 days, hens 21,
ducks 28, turkeys 28, geese 28
to 32, Muscovy ducks 35 to 37.
“Sundowner”; Handling of
disc implements in marginal
country is important. Soil
damage will be reduced if speed
of the tractor is limited to 3\
miles per'hour. The larger the
disc the slower it revolves. Even
then the breast cut should be
adjusted to ensure the minimum
movement of soil and maximum
amount of crop residue left
above the surface.
/“Mr.”: Young trees planted in
Winter put out a healthy show
/of leaves and new growth in the
spring,' giving the impression
that they’re well established. At
this ‘stage, however, the root
systems have barely commenced
development, and as the soil
dries out they’ll be hard put to
it to survive if they don’t get
plenty of water right through
the summer.
“W. Court”: The best medium
for striking cuttings of cama-
tions, petunias and similar half-
hardy plants is pure mud; ob-
tained by saturating a potful of
heavy soil with water and keep-
ing it so, although the pot
should have plenty of drainage-
holes. Young shoots appear to
be easiest to strike, and if they’re
broken off roughly so much the
better. Shrubs that will not
grow from cuttings will grow
from layers.
“0.H.0.”: When you wish to
open a sack of any kind so
that the full width of the cloth
may be used for some other
purpose simply turn the sack
inside out and with the double
stitch to your right side cut the
third stitch on each side of the
sack with a sharp knife. Then,
by pulling the ends of the
severed string the sack may be
opened.
“Elah”: Logs and wood for
the fire that are too wet to burn
properly can be made combus-
tible with oil. Pour old crank-
case-oil in a container about
2in. deep and set wood on end
in it. After half an hour so so,
reverse the ends, and when
ignited the flames from the
burning oil will drive out the
moisture where the oil did not
resell
“Radian”: Carbon - tetra -
chloride is an ideal cleaning
medium for carbon-tracked dis-
tributor-caps and magneto-slip
rings. Wipe the affected part
clean with, a rag soaked in the
fluid, then polish carefully with
a dry cloth.
“Sundowner”: Clean weed-
infested paths with an arsenical
mixture made up of two parts
of whit© arsenic and one part of
caustic soda. Add water to dry
the mixture, which will heat up
until it boils. Add 10 gallons of
water for each pound of arsenic
and spray thinly but evenly so
that each gallon covers about
20 square yards.

of the fence as us,’ he protested.
‘lt seems pretty low to give those
votes to O’Grady to put him
ahead of Cooper.’
‘We’re giving O’Grady noth-
ing,’ said Ritho. ‘On the surface
we’re giving him 400 votes, but
when the counting is finished
you’ll get the seat, so we’re really
not giving him anything.’
‘But he’ll be ahead of Cooper,’
‘There’s only one seat.- No
prize for second place, so why
worry? Most of Cooper’s sup-
porters will be giving you their
second preference. If they can’t
have Cooper they’d rather have
you. They’ll get you and every-
one will be happy.’
The other objection was the
difficulty of getting 400 people
to vote against their beliefs.
Those who raised this point
claimed it would be impossible
to convince loyal Hardy sup-
porters that by voting for
O’Grady they could put Hardy
in. Ritho talked them down
over that one.
‘There’s ourselves to start
with,’ he said, ‘and our wives,
sisters, mothers and so on. It’ll
be easy enough. I’ll draw up a
list.’
Finally he had them all sold
on the idea. Hardy and some of
the others still didn’t think it
was sporting, but all agreed it
seemed the only way out.
SO Ritho worked out a plan
of campaign and they
started out. •
You can imagine the magging
they had to do to persuade the
folk to vote the way they wanted
’em to ; Ritho had found it hard
enough to make Hardy and the
committee understand —blokes
who were really interested in
politics—so they were up against
something trying to explain it to
people who didn’t even know
what preferential voting was.
It all had to be done under
the lap, of course. The usual
election meetings were held, and
various speakers urged the audi-
ences to vote for Hardy, but on
the quiet selected trusties from
Ritho’s list were primed up to
give their number-one vote to
O’Grady number two
1 to Hardy,
About a week before polling
day Ritho told the committee
the job was as good as done.
‘Barring accidents,’ he said,
‘we’re home on the pig’s back.’
I don’t know if appendicitis is
an accident, but that’s what
carried Ritho off to hospital a
couple of hours later. He was
operated on right away, compli-
cations cropped up and it was
well after the declaration of the
poll before he took any interest
in anything outside his own
body.
“Who won?” asked Jacko
Palmer.
“I’ll come to that presently.”
“Well, you’re taking a hell of
a time over it.”
“You say preferential voting
can’t go wrong. I’m going to
prove it can.”
“Well, why don’t you hurry
up and prove it?”
“Let him get on with his
story,” said Jazzer.
“It’s not my story,” said
Spoggie. “It’s the old man’s.
I’m just trying to tell it the same
way he always told it to me.”
“Orright. Get on with it.”
SPOGGIE drained the nearest
beer, pushed his glass for-
ward and resumed.
“That last week was when the
trouble set in. No one knew it
at the time, but the old man
pieced it together afterwards,
and it was something like this.
Hardy’s four hundred selected
voters were all primed up to the
part they had to play, but despite
the care Ritho had taken in pick-
ing them, there were a lot that
really didn’t understand what it
was all about. They knew they
had to give their first vote to
O’Grady and their second to
Hardy and that in some mys-
terious way their action would
help to win Hardy the seat, but
lots of ’em didn’t know why.
And they didn’t grasp the fact
that it was important that only
four hundred Hardy supporters
should vote O’Grady. As a re-
sult, some of them, ’specially the
women, started to do a bit of
electioneering on their own.
‘Oh, no, dear. You’ve got the
wrong idea. It’s this new prefer-
ential voting, you know. You
don’t put number one against
Mr. Hardy. You mark him
number two and put |pumber
one in .this O’Grady person’s
square. That puts Mr. Hardy in.
I don’t understand it all myself,
but Mr. Thompson knows all
about it, and that’s what he told
me —one for O’Grady, two for
Hardy.’
That sort of talk was going on
everywhere, and although Hardy
didn’t know it, Ritho’s plans
were coming unstuck. Ritho
didn’t know, either; he was in
hospital and beyond caring
about such details.
With all this backing and
filling going on it’s only natural
the other candidates got to hear
something of it. Cooper was on
to it quite early. One of the
committeemen who didn’t think
the plan sporting told him all
about it. Cooper didn’t mind.
He was an old campaigner, and
he could appreciate a clever
trick even it it was against him.
And, besides, he wasn’t so sure
that it would be against him. He
was prepared to admit the logic
of Ritho’s arguments, but he
didn’t agree with his figures.
I suppose He was a bit of an
optimist, but according to his
reckoning he and not Hardy was
going to top the first count. That
being so, he really had no need
to worry, because if Ritho was
right about the second prefer-
ences it wouldn’t matter to
Cooper whether it was Hardy
or O’Grady who was eliminated,
since they’d both be giving him
their second prefs.
But Cooper didn’t agree with
Ritho on that point, either. He
looked upon himself as Labor’s
main opponent, and he reckoned
O’Grady’s supporters would feel
the same way about him. Con-
sequently, he felt sure they’d be
giving their second or third
preferences to Hardy and placing
him last on the card.
‘Young Ritho might be
smart!’ he told the renegade
committeeman, ‘but he’s made
a mistake this time. Those 400
votes he’s giving away Won’t put
O’Grady ahead of me, but they’ll
just about put him ahead of
Hardy.’
What Cooper didn’t tell the
committeeman was that he had
decided to go into the giving-
away business himself. He did
a lot of figuring and satisfied
himself he could afford to drop
two hundred first-preferences.
These, given to O’Grady in addi-
tion to Hardy’s four hundred,
would make it a certainty, he
reckoned, that Hardy would slip
back to third-place. He calcu-
lated he could risk O’Grady get-
ting ahead of him on the first
count; Hardy’s preferences
would give him the victory.
So Cooper got to work arrang-
ing for two hundred of his
Henchmen to vote for O’Grady.
And as one elector is much the
same as another, no matter what
party he supports, the result was
the same as in Hardy’s case.
Cooper’s supporters were ex-
plaining to each other that the
best way to get their man elected
was to vote for O’Grady.
“Who won?” asked Jacko
Palmer.
“I’m coming to that.”
“ ’Bout time, too.”
“I’m telling the yarn just as
my old man told it to me.”
“Well, he must’ve been just
as big a bore as you.”
“If you’re going to insult my
old man,” began Spoggie, put-
ting down the glass he had just
picked up.
‘‘ CT HUT up, Jacko,” inter-
posed Jazzer. “Drink your
beer, Spog, and hurry up with
the yarn. What did O’Grady
think about it all?”
“Well, of course, he heard
something about what was going
on. He didn’t know anything'
about Ritho’s deep-laid scheine
or Cooper’s copy of it. And h&
didn’t know their plans were
both going astray. But he
couldn’t help hearing that lots
of their supporters were being
told to vote for him. O’Grady
didn’t worry about theories; he
just took the facts and jumped
to his own conclusions. There
was no finesse or secrecy about
his plan of action. When any-
one asked him to explain prefer-
ential voting he told them
bluntly:
“Well, it’s very complicated,
but y’ don’t have to worry your
head about it really. Jist re-
member it’s the second vote that
counts. That Number Two —put
it in my square. That’s the boy
I want. Number One? Y’ can
give that to whoever you like.
Three and Four, too.’
He wasn’t content just to tell
people this in private, he
preached it openly.
‘That Number One vote niver
got a man in yet. Number Two
for O’Grady—that’s the ticket.’
“Who won?” asked Jacko
Palmer.
“Shut up!” said Jazzer.
“I’ve got to give you the whole
picture,” protested Spoggie. “I
could’ve told you who won at
toL but wHat would be the
use of that? You want to hear
how it worked out, don’t you?”
I s’pose a flood came and
washed the ballot-papers away
just as they were going to count
em, said “lt sounds
yarn -
T . u lsn y ar s; at a U ;it s fa.ct.
happened in Goolagong.”
Get on with it, groveled
Jazzer.
‘ «\1 / ELL, I haven’t said much
W about old Venner. Re-
member I told you he was a
currency crank. Well, that
wasn’t all. He was everything.
No harebrained movement ever
hit Goolagong but he was in it.
His meetings were a joy. He
never talked to the subject but
ranged all over the place. He
used to get a lot of heckling, and
once the interjections started that
would be the end of his pre-
pared speech. He’d go after
whatever red - herring they
dangled in front of him, chase it
till another interjector coaxed
him off on another trail, and
seize any excuse to air his pet
theories and hobbies. Audiences
loved Joe. His schemes were so
wild and woolly and his
enthusiasm for them so intense.
His meetings were voted better
entertainment than the pictures;
supporters of all parties used to
roll up and Joe kept them all in
good humor.
But as for wanting him for
their member, well, they’d have
just as soon been represented by
Barney Allen’s goat.
Joe knew that as well as they
did and it didn’t worry him. He
was out to enjoy himself, and he
thought it well worth the £25
his deposit would cost him.
That was at first, but as the cam-
paign wore on he hit on a plan
whereby he could have his fun
and save his deposit as well. At
the end of his next meeting he
appealed to his audience.
< Kj OW look here, boys ; and
IN you, too, ladies. We’ve all
had a good night. You’ve en-
joyed it and I’ve enjoyed it. 1
know you don’t intend to send
me to Parliament. And I don’t
blame you, either. I’m not so
sure I’ll vote for myself. But at
tire same time I know you’ve all
got a soft spot for old Joe. Well,
here’s your chance to do some-
thing for me. I know as well as
you do I haven’t a dog’s chance
of beating Hardy or Cooper or
O’Grady, When the numbers go
up old Joe Venner’U be right
down in fourth place, at the
bottom of the list. Mark you, I
don’t mind that. I’m only in it
for the fun of the game. But I
don’t mind telling you I don’t
want to lose my deposit. Apart
from the blow to my prestige,
twenty-five quid is twenty-five
quid to me, the same as any
other man.’
Somebody interjected.
‘Cut it out, Joe. You’ll have
us all crying.’
‘No need to cry,’ said Joe.
‘You can all help me. I’ll tell
you how. This preferential vot-
ing gives you a chance to help
me save my deposit and still get
your own man in.’
‘You wouldn’t trick us, Joe.’
‘lt’s no trick. Give me your
No. 1 vote and put No. 2 against
the man you really want. It’s
just a friendly gesture to me.
I’ll still be at the bottom of the
poll, so I’ll be eliminated, and
the votes’ll go where you really
mean ’em to. But it’ll give me a
chance to save my deposit. How
about it, boys? And ladies?
Think it over.’
Lots of them thought it over
and decided to lend Joe Venner
a helping hand. And he stumped
the country telling everyone the
same thing.
So there you have the set-up.
Hardy’s supporters telling each
other to give first-preferences to
O’Grady. Cooper’s men on the
same racket, and O’Grady telling
his friends to vote for whoever
they liked as long as they placed
him second. And old Joe Venner
appealing to everyone to help
him save his deposit.
“Who won?” asked Jacko
Palmer.
• %
/ ENNER, of course. As I
* told you, although he was
a crank everybody liked the old
beggar. No one wanted to see
him lose his deposit, so thousands
of them did as he asked, gave
him their No. 1 preference and
then voted their party ticket, or
what they thought was their
party ticket. Old Joe was honest
enough. All he wanted to do
was save his deposit, but he con-
vinced so many people that he
not only topped the poll, but got
an absolute majority. There was
no need to distribute second-
preferences at all, so all the
careful schemes went for
nothing. Ritho nearly had a re-
lapse when they told him.”
Spoggie drained another glass,
looked at Jacko Palmer and
said: “And that’s how preferen-
tial voting worked out in Goola-
gong.”
“It wasn’t a fair trial,”
grunted Jacko. “Properly con-
ducted, it’s the fairest system
known. Anyone’ll tell you that.”
Spoggie shook his head.
“Out your way they might,”
he said. “But not in Goo-
lagong.”

Hazards.
“A competitor at the International
Chess Congress at Hastings (England),
exasperated at losing a bishop,
gnashed his teeth so hard he broke
his upper dental plate and had to
secure adjournment of play while he
had it repaired.”
There are doubtless some who
will regard this incident with a
levity as unseemly as it is
thoughtless. As the scion of a
family which has earned a just
celebrity by the intrepidity with
which its members have ever
faced the manifold hazards of
“Pardon me, sir—you dropped something .”
the various strenuous indoor
sports in which they have chosen
to demonstrate their prowess, I
can readily sympathise with the
harassed chess-player.
The archives of our family
and the records of euchre
tournaments bear no more dis-
tinguished example of stamina
and sacrifice than that of my
notable kinsman Sir Bloodwing
Boobe, who, as laird of the vil-
lage of Bubblegum-on-Mush, led
a crack team against that of
Lord Lushmeadows, the dashing
squire of Micklemuckle, and
thereby suffered two black eyes
—the first, we proudly aver, in
the history of the sport.
It was an historic and dour
match. After three hours of
shuffling, dealing and leading the
players were nearing the limits
of physical endurance. Lord
Lushmeadows’s knuckles were
almost red from the dramatic
banging-down of his cards. To
the spectators, brought to a high
pitch of excitement by the thril-
ling play, it must have seemed
that my great-uncle would have
to withdraw from the contest
through becoming muscle-bound
at a vital moment, caused
through his strenuous method of
shuffling. But Sir Bloodwing did
not acknowledge the proud
name of Boobe for nothing.
Summoning up all the reserves
of his great strength, he com-
menced dealing; but, his fingers
slipping on one from the bot-
tom of the deck, he pulled his
biceps, triceps and even his for-
ceps. With perfect sportsman-
ship, his opponent allowed him
five minutes’ massage by his
trainer.
Like a giant refreshed, Sir
Bloodwing finished the deal
without showing the slightest
trace of physical distress, such
was the great resiliency of his
muscular organism. The strain
on his wrist as he turned up the
card Lord Lushmeadows cut
must have been terrific, but he
managed it without batting an
eyelid.
With superb confidence my
great-uncle announced he would
“go alone,” and took up the
card —remember, he had dealt
them —and with magnificent
skill led the joker, followed by
the right, left, ace and queen.
Came the triumphant crash of
Lord Lushmeadows’s knuckles as
he took the last trick with the
king—Sir Bloodwing had for-
gotten and dealt his opponent
four savers to the “butcher” in-
stead of the intended three. At
sight of his opponent raking in
the vital trick my kinsman’s eyes
shot out, striking his spectacles
with terrific force. He was com-
pelled to wear a beefsteak on his
lamps for almost a week.
Another example of the awful
hazards run by top-ranking in-
door sportsmen was that of my
cousin, Belshazzar Boobe, one
of the State’s leading snakes-
and-ladders exponents and three
times champion of his district.
Steeling himself by long prac-
tice with the dice against the
shock of having to slide down
to the snake’s tail, Belshazzar
went into serious training for a
vital inter-parish match by hav-
ing himself rubbed down morn-
ing and night with peanut-oil
and pineapple skins, followed
by an hour’s strenuous reading
of Hoyle, and topped off with a
forceful session of shoving his
marker around the board. By
the day of the contest he was in
wonderful condition, each neces-
sary set of muscles acting almost
in co-ordination with ear, eyes
and what his fond mother used
to refer to as his brain.
He started off brilliantly with
two sixers and a two, and fol-
lowed with a glorious shot that
took him straight up a ladder to
make him 38, while his op-
ponent was mustering a modest
14 through faulty handwork.
Belshazzar ran to 50 with some
beautifully-judged throwing all
around the board.
But soon my cousin’s game
unaccountably lapsed, whilst his
opponent, coming with a skilful
burst, leaped two ladders to
equalise. Thereafter it was a
thrilling neck-and-neck race into
ē
BO.

coast
No traffic-cop could ever query
His record or suggest that beery
Indulgence spoiled his sheer
perfection.
But now at last a sad defection
Has marred his excellent repute.
For Jones was plainly seen to
shoot
Past red lights at a hectic speed;
And as excuse for such a deed
Can only plead this tale, to wit —
His wife had phoned him:
“Step on it!”

Runnymede to Canberra
The people are losing liberties fought
for and established in a.d. 1215 and held
to until recent years. With one slight
lapse, one might say, from 1648 to 1660,
the British people in England forged
steadily ahead in building well on the
foundations laid at Runnymede. Now,
after 700 years of progress, we are back
behind scratch again. The liberties gained
—how precious will they seem once they
are lost' —are being destroyed or given
up, seemingly in a sort of political trance,
in which the patient is drugged with weird
opiates: “Planning,” ‘'lnevitability,”
“Unavoidable,” “Orderly Marketing,”
“Shortages,” “Targets,” “Emergency,”
“Crisis,” “Direction of Labor,” “Con-
trols”—good heavens, one could fill a
page with examples of this gibberish.
Gibberish to an alert people, but far too
easily accepted today.
The British people—and that means
us —have lost, or are in imminent danger
of losing, the following fundamental
freedoms, without which life cannot be
really worth living:
The right to buy food as they like.
The right to build a home and live in it.
The right to travel freely.
The right to work where, at what, and
when they like.
The right to discuss politics openly.
The right to inviolate communication
by mail.
The right to stand in their own home
and refuse admittance to any without due
warrant.
The right to true Parliamentary gov-
ernment, and not government by decree.
The two absolute foundation-stones of
British justice, that no man shall be
arrested without a warrant or held with-
out trial.
The march of our race from Runny-
mede to Canberra has brought us to
what? Let Bernard Shaw supply the
answer: “The final end of Socialism is
slave-labor and death.” —R. H. G. (W.A.).
Study of Two Systems
Laissez-faire individualism is not cap-
able of adjustment and improvement
without, in reality, ceasing to exist. Like
its philosophical opposite,*Socialism, it is
an extreme doctrine. The one allows no
Governmental restraint on individual con-
duct in the economic sphere, the other
makes the individual the slave of the
State,
In a complex society with numerous
divergent interests there must be a certain
degree of regulation by the State for the
common good. It should be no more
than is necessary to assure general living
conditions that will enable a family to be
reared in decency and dignity. Under
laissez-faire there is no protection for
class or individual against unscrupulous
conduct by others more favorably placed,
save when its effect is counterbalanced
by opposed social customs that have the
force of law, or by religious ideas that
have profound practical influence. The
growth of huge, formless cities, with the
varied problems they create, ruthless de-
struction of wild life, the squandering of
natural resources by persons inspired by
the get-rich-quick motive, are certain de-
velopments of the system.
Laissez-faire can function, without be-
coming intolerable, in a thinly-peopled
country of great potentialities, like mid-
nineteenth-century U.S.A. and Australia,
but where a high stage of industrial de-
velopment has been reached its evils have
become so evident that even Governments
reluctant to do so have been obliged to
introduce modifications. U.S.A. presents
a latter-day case. Rugged individualism,
as Americans term laissez-faire, had to
be curbed in various ways by Roosevelt.
The masses show no desire for its return.
Indeed, fear of the Republicans reverting
to it is considered to have been a factor
in Truman’s retention of the Presidency.
—Morris the Tinker (N.S.W.),
The Spanish-American Empire
The reference in the Red Page review
of Emil Ludwig’s Bolivar to the Spanish-
American peoples “breaking free from a
distant dominion which pressed very
mildly on them by comparison with the
tyrannies they inflicted on themselves”
describes an historical fact which has only
of late years begun to win recognition in
the English-speaking world.
Spain’s rule in the Indies —as the
Spanish-American world was termed —
was the reverse of the grinding tyranny
of which Spain has often been accused.
Far from the colonies being exploited to
enrich the motherland, they were very
much more prosperous than Spain, and
some were economically relatively better
off than in modem times. Thus speaks a
20th-century Mexican historian, Esqueval
Obregon:
The wage-earner of colonial days could
buy as much wheat as a French wage-
earner of our day (1908), but the Mexican
wage-earner of 1908 can hardly buy more
than the Frenchman of the sad days of
Charles IX in the sixteenth century. We
have gone backwards.
Salvador de Madariaga comments in his
The Rise of the Spanish American Empire:
What strikes one most in the narratives of
travellers in the Indies is the enjoyment of
life, freedom and abundance they felt there.
The. Spaniards were not behindhand
in bringing to the Indies the advantages
of new discoveries in science, nor were
eductionaf facilities lacking. No fewer
than 20 universities were established —
there is none even today in the British
West Indies. There were many other
scholastic and a wealth of charitable in-
stitutions, The technical college in
Mexico City won high praise from Von
Humboldt. So did the School of Mines.
There was a large class of skilled crafts-
men in the Spanish Indies, particularly in
the two wealthiest vice-royalties, Mexico
and Peru. Architecture reached a high
level. “There were noble cities in Spanish
America a century before London really
deserved that name.” Some of the best
examples of the Baroque style are to be
found in these lands. The wealth of
Spanish America inspired many attacks,
but these only affected the outer fringes
“I cannot tell a lie, father. I did it with my little hatchet !”
of that vast territory. Spain’s three
centuries of rule in South and Central
America “count in history as one of the
most creative, and certainly the most
peaceful, a continent has ever known.”
Constitutionally the Spanish-American
lands did not rank as dependencies of
Spain, but as separate kingdoms owing
fealty to the same sovereign—their rulers
viceroys, not governors. Thus the
Spanish Empire approximated in char-
acter to the British Commonwealth of
today. On retirement a viceroy had to
undergo legal inquisition into his rule —a
safeguard against tyranny and extortion.
Some of the viceroys were men of the
Lachlan Macquarie stamp —Revillagi-
gedo, O’Higgins and Galvez, for instance.
Why then was there rebellion?
The republican ideas spread by
the French Revolution had attracted
adherents in Spanish America. Taking
advantage of the disorganised state of
Spain after Napoleon’s invasion, this
section sought replacement of the royal
authority in their homelands by republi-
can institutions. The series of conflicts
that ensued were essentially civil wars
between them and their countrymen who
remained faithful to the Bourbon dynasty
of Spain. Comparatively few Spaniards
took part, for even after the defeat of
Napoleon Spain was in no position to
afford the loyalists effective help. In
Bolivar the republicans found a leader
of exceptional talent, political as well as
military. They also received substantial
recruitment in men and money in Eng-
' land, U.S.A. and Europe. Amongst other
able European officers, Lord Cochrane,
one of the best seamen of the day, served
them. Even so it took several years’ hard
fighting before the loyalists were over-
come. — Castlereagh (N.S.W.).
The Slums
Present-day artists have a passion for
painting slums in all their ugliness, and
placing the accent on poverty, hunger and
dirt. The impression derived from such
“creative efforts” is that the denizens of
the hovels are the victims of rapacious
landlords, unemployment and grim
penury.
There is a slum of another sort:
Six fairly modern cottages face a
narrow lane near the centre of the city.
Each is overcrowded with subtenants.
The verandahs are mostly cluttered with
surplus furniture, but some of them have
been converted into sleepouts with the
aid of tattered hessian, torn blankets and
packing-case timber. Groups of children
play in the gutter with an assortment of
expensive toys. The young men and
maidens are smartly dressed. The adults
are in full employment, and spend their
wages freely in the usual manner. The
domestic conditions must present many
problems in comfort, privacy and hygiene.
The houses are sadly in need of repair,
but the landlords can neither afford the
cost nor obtain the necessary materials.
The profits of subletting go to the original
tenants, who don’t worry about damage
or defacement. Every day in every way
the lane is deteriorating. During the de-
pression it looked respectable, although
the rents were seldom paid. During the
boom it is an unblushing slum. There
are many similar spots in our cities, and
they are multiplying apace. —R. Tist
(S.A.).
“My Army, Oh My Army”
“Ek Dum’s” penetrating articles dis-
close that he is closely in touch with
latest developments of the Australian
Army, and he hits the nail on the head
in his remarkable diagnosis of its weak-
nesses (B. 22/12/’4B). I would urge him
to make an examination of the results of
the first half-year’s home training of the
“voluntary” Army (Militia). He would
be amazed, I think, at the poor showing
for such a huge expenditure of money.
It Ipoks as if the weird Interim Army is
made up of hundreds of former clerks,
storemen —both permanent and tem-
porary—who were put into uniform
when the 1939-45 war started, and are still
there, though now only doing their old
peace-time jobs. The Interim Army
couldn’t defend us against a New
Zealand football team. —Civis (Vic.).
Land-sales Control
A few days ago I witnessed the absurd
spectacle of a house being sold at auction
for a price in the vicinity of £2OOO. An
outside valuation would •probably be
somewhere about £B5O-£9OO.
What the outcome will be is hard to
determine, but something like this will
happen. Land-sales Control will consent
at a figure much below the auction price,
the owner will then refuse to sell. A
blackmarket quote will then be submitted
by the purchaser; if acceptable the sale
will proceed, if not other bidders will
begin street-corner negotiations and a sale
will surely follow in the “black.”
In spite of arguments advanced against
the open market it seems preferable to
this type of transaction. C. B. M.
(N.S.W.).
Luxury Tourist Hotels
Queensland Government wants a chain
of luxury hotels on the islands along the
reef, but where are these establishments
to obtain their guests? It is doubtful
if there is a sufficient proportion of Aus-
tralians with the means to pay the high
costs of a Barrier Reef holiday at luxury
hotels. Many Australians wish to see
the reef —and would, if they had the
necessary cash. What they need are
hostels providing clean, comfortable ac-
commodation with good plain food from
reef sources—fish, oysters, crabs, tropical
fruit and the like.
Hundreds of tourists who come north
complain of the food. “We can have
as much steak-and-eggs as we can eat
in the south, but we cannot have tropical
fruit, vegetables or reef-fish, unless we
pay shocking prices for them. When we
come here we expect to have them in
the hotels. Instead we get comed-beef
or steak-and-eggs.”
Just because luxury establishments are
a success in the Bahamas and Florida it
does not follow that the same holds good
for Australia. The success of the tourist
trade in Australia depends on people with
moderate to small incomes. The influx
of politicians to the north last winter
may have misled the Queensland Gov-
ernment, which apparently forgot that
politicians have no rail-fare worries, —
Cadaagi (N.Q.),
The Passing of the Prad
The horse is disappearing. In my
district the young Australian drives the
truck for rounding up sheep, getting the
cows in and numerous other short-
distance jobs for which the horse is more
effective and cheaper. Some fair-sized
grazing properties are without a hack
of any kind, while some youthful Aus-
tralians of the land have not learned to
ride.
It’s a pity the horseman tradition,
characteristic of our people, is disappear-
ing—and at what a cost to the land in
petrol and dollars. Is it possible that in
50 years or so only the pictures of our
Lighthorsemen will remain and their
feats of horsemanship become merely an
old legend?—C. B. M. (N.S.W.).
N.S.W. Population-shift
The discovery that since 1940 the elec-
toral population has risen in Sydney by
4500, Newcastle by 1500, and the country
by only 1000 has led “Labor” to believe
that the only remedy is to increase the
metropolitan electorates and reduce the
rural ones.
While this may adjust present anomalies
it is no permanent solution, because if
the present rate is maintained a similar
position will arise again after a further
eight years. The cause, drift of popu-
lation from country to city, is completely
ignored.
Politically the only solution is to make
the rural voice stronger, instead of
weaker, in the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly. That will never be, therefore
real rural development will come only
from the creation of new States, already
overdue in N.S.W, and Queensland. —
J.B.R. (N.S.W.).
A Plainer Car
A fair number of people would like
a motor-car as a machine for providing
a reasonably comfortable means of trans-
port rather than a collection of luxury
items such as wireless sets, timepieces,
cigar-lighters and fantastically disguised
radiators, designed to make the car look
ever so cute to the impressionable buyer.
It is true that the more utilitarian-
minded can buy a used car in which the
frills are worn out, but that means an
old engine and works as well. There is
room on the market for a simpler design.
Henry Ford made n much profit from a car
designed primarily for reliable transport.
The practical development of a similar
idea could well be tried. — Metax (Tas).
Fellowship of Writers
Muir Holburn, as president of the
N.S.W, branch of the Fellowship (B.
29/12/’4B), evades the charge that the
Fellowship is now run by a group of
Communists and fellow-travellers. He
doesn’t deny that there are Communists
on the executive, and that more than half
of the remainder vote with the Comrades
on all occasions, particularly on political
•issues unrelated to the interests of Aus-
tralian authors.
And does Mr. Holburn believe that the
Communist-owned “Newsletter” Printery
would have printed the Fellowship’s
quarterly news - sheet if the outfit
quartered at 38 Clarence-street, Sydney,
was not regarded by the bosses at Marx
House as being in the Communist fold?
Mr. Holburn won’t admit that the
Fellowship is under the thumb of a Com-
munist clique. To openly confess that
would disclose the real aims of its rulers,
antagonise the r ” ' democratically-
inclined members still on its books, dam-
age what small standing it may have in
uninformed circles, and, of course,
destroy its value as a medium for the
dissemination of Red propaganda.
Mr. Holburn’s only defence is his tail-
end rejoinder that the Fellowship is “not
a vehicle for party politics, witch-hunting
or any other practices which tend to im-
pose arbitrary restrictions upon the intel-
lectual and social interests of the Aus-
tralian author.” No witch-hunting? Then
why the refusal to accept the resigna-
tion of a member who, on principle,
sought to resign?
Attempting to deny the drift from the
Fellowship “of the old Australian school
of writers,” Mr. Holburn claims that the

cap makes his smiling face look cada-
verous. His superannuated uniform is
patched and ends at his knee. He is
mounted on a perfect Japanese copy of
the Malvern Star of 1896, which is
attached by various adventitious couplings
to a hooded rickshaw, of which the cover-
ings are made of a bit of antediluvian
Army tarpaulin.
“Hey, kurumaya san,” you say in your
best Japanese. “Take me to the Akasaka
Palace.”
“Akasaka Palace?” says the kurumaya,
with a rising note in his voice which
ought to warn you, but doesn't. “Ah so! ”
You get into the rickshaw. He tucks you
in, leaving one small crack through which
you glimpse now his heaving muscles,
now pieces of the Tokyo scene as it might
have appeared many a year ago on the
zoetrope or wheel of life.
Huge granite buildings with tremendous
rows of Grecian pillars, endless footpath
booths selling fountain-pens and wallets,
a gentleman carrying a fish larger than
himself, stalls in front of which are red
apples on clean china-plates, vegetable
shops in which great yellow daikons lie
moistly peeled among the spuds and
carrots and beans, teashops from which
issue the blast of Bing Crosby at his
loudest and sugariest. You see all this
wavering, as through a mirage, as the
rickshaw bucks from side to side. It
jangles as it goes. The kurumaya also
jangles; so does his bicycle. You
jangle, too. You enjoy a feeling of well-
being induced by the certitude and ex-
pedition with which he is covering the
ground. You have no misgiving at the
fact that he seems to be traversing an un-
familiar route. Perhaps, you think, he
feels that your grand friends of the Maru-
nouchi would not like to see you in a
Japanese vehicle.
Then suddenly he stops, and, as the
rattle and bang produced by the progress
of the rickshaw ceases, you realise that
you in the midst of a whirlpool of
cheerful sound. Samisen and gramo-
phone tinkle and w,ail. There is a babble
of tittering laughter. The old Army tar-
paulin is thrust aside, and the face of the
kurumaya appears beatified with the same
sort of expression that Napoleon must
have worn after Marengo.
“Yoshiwara,” he announces triumph-
antly,
“Go on with you,” you say. , “You
naughty old man, General MacArthur
has abolished all yoshiwaras. Ino want
yoshiwara.”
You gaze around you, blushing. Two
beautiful young ladies, as happy as kittens,
are bowing to yon in a doorway. Other
beautiful young things are casting almond
eyes at you, not invitingly but curiously.
Everybody looks happy and bubbling
over with goodwill. In fact, there is no
doubt whatever that you are in a
yoshiwara, for in Japan the daughters of
joy always look joyful, and these certainly
are acting in the best tradition.
“Kurumaya san,” you yell. “I am a re-
spectable and elderly Australian citizen,
I don’t want your yoshiwara. I want the
Akasaka Palace. Isoide okure out of this,
you scut.”
“Ah so,” says the obliging kurumaya,
with rising inflection, as if a great
thought had dawned on him. He walks
over to a couple of ladies. Half the
population of the street seems to join
him. They hold a debate. The phrases
“ah so” and “Akasaka” float into the
welkin. It sounds like a meeting of the
Sydney City Council in the days when
Paddy Stokes was Lord Mayor.
After some time they appear to reach
a decision. We are off again. We jangle
along for perhaps a quarter of a mile.
We stop. The kurumaya says cheerfully,
“Get kempei!”
You arrive at a small wayside booth,
where you behold the kempei engaged
in picking his teeth. He salutes impres-
sively.
He is a small copper, dressed in a very
much worn blue suit, a cap like an old-
fashioned fireman’s and very dirty boots.
His. stern is decorated with a large re-
volver which hangs under his coat and
gives him the appearance of a blue
monkey with its tail in his pocket.
He takes the slip on which your needed
address is written in Japanese and Eng-
lish and studies it carefully as one would
an abstruse mathematical problem.
After three or four minutes he sud-
denly comes to life.
“Ah!” he shouts. “Akasaka Palace!
Ah so!”
With a tremendous display of vigor
he pulls a large whistle, from his jacket
and blows it lustily. At once two more
kempei appear from behind the shed.
One of them is wiping his mouth on his
sleeve. They all go into a huddle with
the kurumaya and two odd pedestrians.
The words “Akasaka Palace” and “Ah so”
ring louder and louder.
As if he were leading a forlorn hope
at Wewak the first kempei rushes into his
shelter and savagely attacks an offend-
ing telephone . . . “Akasaka Palace ewa
do mairimasu ka? . . . Ah ! . . .
Akasaka. Ah so! Ah so! ...”
Back comes the kempei. “Akasaka
Palace?” he asks innocently. “Please, is
it hotel?” Actually it is one of the best-
known of the old Royal buildings of
Tokyo. You say so. “Ah so,” says the
kurumaya. Ditto the kempei.
I suppose if you waited long enough
you would really discover in the end
how things really get done in Japan, but
you feel that you have had enough when
the kempei has led you down the street
about half a mile, holding a debate in
every shop, appointing every passing
pedestrian to the committee of investiga-
tion, peeping up every lane and even
stopping trams to inquire.
But temptation comes in your way
when you find, after about two hours’ not-
unprofitable wandering, that you are in
front of a European-looking garden with
an American lady in it.
“Madam,” you say. “May I use your
telephone?”
“Why, sure,” says the lady. And
“ Dammit , is this supposed to be modern art or what?”
within 10 minutes you are alighting from
the large black Humber with the military
driver to which you are entitled as a
V.1.P., at the Akasaka Palace.
Now the strange thing about all this
is that it does not irritate you. In fact,
it doesn’t irritate anybody concerned.
If it happened to you in Australia you
would be almost a raving lunatic at the
end of it. But here everybody is good-
tempered from first to last. The kuru-
maya, the kempei, the casuals all join
in the game as if it were good, clean
fun. They go to endless trouble. They
are apparently ready to keep on at it
to the crack' of doom. And the only
feeling you have when it is all over is that
you have been involved in a grand
adventure and that you and the rest of
them are all blood-brothers, as if you
had been to the Pole together. The
kempei bows to the ground and laughs
in such a way that you find it hard to
believe that a few years ago he would
have ordered you around like a lost
hound. The kurumaya takes a hundred
yen as if it were the wealth of Golconda.
And all is as merry as a marriage-bell.
Everything in Japan seems to be con-
ducted like that.
Except for occasional farmers, you
rarely see a Japanese alone. He is always
engaged in productive effort, but it is
always concerted effort or directed effort.
No Japanese male seems to be equipped
with more than a part of a mind. It
needs to be added to other minds to pro-
duce thought and reasoning.
And yet the peculiar processes by
which Japan functions produce some
amazing results. It is a closely electri-
fied country, for instance, with power-
lines everywhere, its towers striding, grey
steel giants, over the pine-clad razor-
backs of the granitic hills. Yet the whole
country shows the greatest disrespect for
the principles of insulation, with the re-
sult that dwellings are always catching
fire and citizens getting electrocuted. They
have greater fire risks than any country
in the world, yet few cities worry about
a water-supply.
They have mastered the technique of
making superb and delicate scientific in-
struments, yet their medical systems are
primitive. They have many medical
universities. Yet when Guntaino San gets
pneumonia or cholera morbus, he packs
up his whole family, including his grand-
father and grandmother, the missus and
the kids, his cooking-pots and any spare
provender which he does not wish to
waste, plus a little necessary fuel, and
retires to hospital, where he and all his
relations are inducted into a room and
left to fight it out with the bacteria en
masse. Sometimes they seem to defeat
the viruses by sheer weight of numbers.
The Japanese love tunnelling—they
plan stupendous works involving the
digging of holes through miles of granite
hills. They love town-planning. When
they decide that it will be well to run a
street about 50 yards wide through the
centre of a teeming city there is no non-
sense about it. They plough that avenue
out of the solid carpet of dwellings of
which most Japanese cities consist and
then fclant 20,-year-old trees on each side
of it, so that the thoroughfare looks as if
it had been there for ever.
Osaka has an immense and modern
racecourse which makes Randwick seem
a little childish in design. And when
the roads were laid down to it, they were
built wide and straight enough and in
suitable directions to be used as fighter
strips during the war.
In the same city a local magnate had a
brainwave. He secured from the Gov-
ernment a concession to build an electric
railway to the suburb of Takarazuka,
nearly as far away from the heart of
Osaka as Windsor is from Sydney.
On the city end, next to Osaka' main
station, he built one terminus. Above it
he raised a magnificent department store,
which sells everything from a Ming vase
to American movie magazines. At the
other end—well over 20 miles from the
city, mark you—he put up a huge build-
ing in the midst of pleasure-grounds.
The pleasure-grounds include a zoo and
various other attractions. The building
includes, as a main attraction, a vast
theatre in which daily matinees of “opera”
are given. The charge for admission is
about 2s. for front seats. The theatrical
company consists entirely of beautiful
young girls. Their repertoire embraces
everything from classic Japanese tradi-
tional opera to “Madame Butterfly” and
modern melodrama. And every day the
theatre is packed out, the trains are
packed out and the department store —to
a lesser extent —is packed out.
It is, however, at another Osaka plea-
sure-ground that Guntaino San is seen
at his most natural, with, so to speak, his
hair down. This is the Flower Park, to
which he'and his families resort in droves
to take the air and other invigorating
liquids and gases.
It is a spacious park containing a high
hill with gazebos, woods, walks, a de-
lightful waterfall. Several hothouses dot
the park placed with "a delightful unob-
trusiveness. Inside these there are dis-
plays of chrysanthemums apd invariably
a large tableau, representing a fairy-tale
or a legend from Japanese history.
The main characteristics of these
tableaux are their great scale and their
horror. Each one of them includes some
dominating figure which is affrightening
and lethal —some monstrous being with
moving parts, including a lolling tongue,
some villain who is carving up the inno-
cent with a sword, some bravo who is
hammering somebody weaker than him-
self with a waddy and deriving fiendish
satisfaction from the performance. Yet
all the pictures are woven with infinite
patience and attention to detail in huge
masses of flowers, and all obviously have
an hypnotic effect on Guntaino San and
give him an appetite for lunch.
Outside in the glades and summer-
houses you see him early in the day, en
famille, strewing his waste-paper and
bottles about in a manner which would
make a Sydneyite envious, and fortifying
himself for the homeward journey with
good liquor. It is not till completion
of this process that you understand how
thoroughly he enjoys himself. The park
towards sundown is strewn with recum-
bent forms which give no sign of life.
They have fallen just where it is con-
venient, defeated flasks and bottles all
around them. You might be on the field
of Waterloo after the battle.
Presently their families come and take
them home. They seem bereft of all
bone structure, reduced to masses of
lolling jelly. Fathers and young brothers,
sisters and wives combine to heave them
up somehow and drag them to the train
like wet rag-dolls. Since there seem to
be nothing about them to grip except
their garments, and these usually only
establish a hold under the armpits, there
is generally on view a wide expanse of
the middle of the reveller, which some-
times gets scraped at the turnstiles. All
the reveller’s party looks as if it is having
a good time and as if his helpless condi-
tion is a good joke.
One of the strangest paradoxes about
Guntaino San which must be mentioned
is his peculiar affinity with Australians.
They are the only people who do not
fraternise officially with him. The
official Australian attitude is that never,
never must this civilised land be conta-
minated by association with the beasts
in human form who tortured our boys
in Borneo and coveted our motherland.
Yet it is strange to see Australian ex-
p.-0.-w. whom you observed only two or
three years ago in 113th A.G.H. emaci-
ated skeletons, fresh from prison camps
and shouting for revenge, defending the
Japanese as a race and combating the
theory that behind the mask Dai Nippon
may harbor some ambition to get a bit of
its own back.
There are plenty of Australians who
were in Japan after the surrender who
swear that —though just then bombed to
pieces and with the charred remains of
thousands of their dead under the wreck-
age—the population of Hiroshima and
Kure felt no hostility to conquering
troops when they arrived.
Others there are who attribute this to
a natural insensitiveness rather than to
goodwill.
Fellowship has retained their loyalty and
support.
That is eyewash. It is true that most
of their names may appear on some
obsolete mailing-list, but do they still pay
their annual subscriptions? Members
who have ceased to contribute their
financial dues can hardly be regarded as
loyal, let alone “enthusiastic” supporters.
The Fellowship books, says Mr. Hoi-
burn, “show a constant and gratifying
increase in members.” Only an inde-
pendent check of the treasurer’s receipts
and membership roll and a comparison
with previous membership totals would
determine the validity of that claim.
There were nearly 250 financial members
10 years ago. How many are financial
today?
The Sunday-night meetings and the
occasional receptions to distinguished
literary visitors are now a farce. Mr.
Holburn may be satisfied with audiences
of fewer than 30 people, but old-timers
can remember the clubroom packed to
the door every Sunday evening.
As for the recital of Fellowship achieve-
ments, it would be impossible and unwise
for any society with the professed aims
of the Fellowship not to achieve any
results. The bulk of the spadework, how-
ever, was done in the past—the hard
digging was done by authors who are
disinclined to be seen in company with
the Comrades. — Old Freelance (N.S.W.).
The Adelaide branch of the Fellow-
ship of Australian Writers has fallen
in stature. When it began here
a decade ago under the title of Writers’
and Artists’ Club, it was a live body and
included leading S.A. writers, but, like
Lamb’s “Familiar Faces,” all have gone.
We had interesting talks and lectures,
young writers were encouraged and given
helpful criticism, then war broke out,
members enlisted, and the club has never
been the same.
It has not been captured by Corns,
but is a gathering of booklovers rather
than writers. By paying half subscription
rates anybody is admitted as an associ-
ate member, which has aggravated the
defection.—A. D. (S.A.).

The A.W.A. monogram on any instrument is a
mark of quality and scientific craftsmanship. It is
the symbol of the Radio Age, representing the
knowledge gained from research and engineering
over more than 35 years.
Behind all A.W.A. products and services are the
A.W.A. laboratories, which have advanced radio in
the home, on the highways, at sea, and in the air.
As one of Australia’s key industrial organisations,
A.W.A. recognises the value of scientific research
and its important role in peace and security.
