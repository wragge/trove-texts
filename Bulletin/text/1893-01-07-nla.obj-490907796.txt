Tales of the Riverne.
BY PRICE WARUNG.
Jim the Rebater.
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
On the UppCr Murray.
The snow water is rushing swiftly between the
eucalypt-bordered banks, and on the fretted and
billowy surface of the green water float boughs
and branches that drank their primal sap from the
ice-cold heights .of the Snowys. Nestling in a
fork of a sapling are some sprigs of a blooming
acacia whose roots are in the Tumberumba
country ; a tortuous creeper, torn by a storm-blast
from the valley of the Eucumbene, clings to a
trunk which was nourished hard by Kiandra. Like
a big-sized bully into a throng of school lads
comes crashing through the swirl of the current
and the lighter timber, a monstrous red-gum that
the water has just wrested from the clayey
banks of the greatest of Australian rivers. The
tangle goes down stream together to communi-
cate in the quaint language of Nature its
message from lofty snow-rimmed peaks to plains
which burst arid split under the brazen sky, and
to tell the poor human who toils and sweats
amidst dust and aridity that, after all, there
is a joy and a glory in the world which
the great Riverine squatter, who tops the market
with his wool, cannot purchase with his wealth.
And with the tangle and the stream goes—a soul.
The red-gum log will forge its way through
r.-ach and bend, and will evade the grappling
rope as the sawmillers try, one after another, to
lasw it as it is hurled by their craft. It will
voy igc so for miles, and then it will
be cooped by a snag, which will hold it tight and
still tighter, till the suction of the under-tow draws
it do .11 and down, and embeds it in the bottom
drift, and it becomes a snag in its turn —the
f talest of tools to rip up planks and open seams,
ui d to dc. 'roy i i one desperate instant the fruit
of laborious yeai s.
And the sou l , too, goes down stream with the
mass of wood stuff, and after its journey of a few
hundred miles, it, tqo, falls a victim to the vicious
na 1 rtow of life, and becomes in its turn a snag,
which shall wreck another soul.
# # *
Jim Filzgerald came of a second genera-
tion of “gully-rakers.” The grandfather had
been one of the assigned; hands of a Monaro
pioneer, and, by the time he had won his freedom,
ha 1 githered a tidy little herd together—a
head here, and a head there, a “clear skin”
of his master’s now, and a Umeralla “wild
’un” then. He put his brand on them, and,
with a block of “out country” and an occa-
sional addition of a “stolen and strayed ” bull or
cow, (lid well. The ex-convict’s son took con-
genially to,the business. The father had known
some restraints of conscience, but had been careful
to give his boy a training which had dulled in his
earliest youth any tendency towards straightfor-
wardness in dealing with others’ goods. A course
of instruction which consisted almost entirely in
scouring gully and plain in order to stock a moun-
tain fastness at a neighbour’s expense was not
likely to induce a delicacy of discrimination
between what belonged to him of other species of
property and what did not. And nobody was
surprised when, after an excursion to Boyd Town
on Twofold Bay with cattle, he did not return
promptly. A sentence of twenty years on the
roads for horse-stealing interfered with his engage-
ments—and no living soul regretted his fate.
He had a wife and a boy of five when his “ mis-
fortune ” happened. The boy was too young to
understand, and the wife—well, she thanked God
for the crowning mercy of her husband’s arrest.
She had the habit of consulting Providence on all
occasions, for she had “found Christ.” When a
young woman who had just left school at Sydney,
she had heard in the old York-street Chapel a
sermon of the red-hot Methodist stamp. The
discourse was warm with the old-fashioned hell,
and splendid with particular details of the old-
fashioned heaven, and instinct with a passionate
yearning over a doomed race, fierce with an
intense horror of sin, gluttonous of conversions,
mad with the madness of the Hebrew prophets over
the stiff-necked and the perverse. No wonder the
girl, whose people had sent her to school because
her home-life was not likely to make her “ a
lady,” became “convinced of sin.” She knew
nothing of life, but of sin she knew (so she fancied)
much. And then, after one of those experiences
of storm and struggle which are all indispens-
able conditions of growth, so the old-style
Methodists thought, to the new soul, she “ found
peace.”
When she married, inveigled, she scarcely knew
how, by the dashing young cattle-dealer who came
once or twice a quarter with stock to Boyd Town
where her people kept store, she did not lose her
faith. On the contrary, it deepened and strength-
ened. Every fresh revelation of her husband’s
wrong-doing was a stab welcomed to the martyr’s
heart. Only, when the child came, she craved
that the Lord would help her to save the boy
from his father —perhaps for the church. And
in the father’s arrest she saw the hand of God.
By the time news of his conviction reached her in
the Fitzgerald homestead in a Cooma valley, she
had made up her mind what to do. Some
few head of stock she had brought with her upon
her marriage. These and their increase she sold.
And then, first bidding the police do their will
on the rest of the stock on their run, she took her
child and her money and disappeared from the
knowledge of the district. The child was hers
and the money she took was hers —and, as to the
future, was not the God of Sarah and Rebekah
and Mary her God ? He surely would save the
lad’s soul as He had saved hers.
And now, seventeen years after, the child of
five, grown into the young man of twenty-two,
stands upon the river bank at Corowa, and
watches the struggle of the brush and timber with
the stream. He has settled everything with h : s
dead mother’s lawyer, and has just been handed,
in the form of a bank draft on Melbourne, his
fortune. Not many hundreds—only five or six ;
and yet a fortune to the lad who has never left
the riverside, and to whom the cities are places
unknown, save for the one dread fact—“the
bad men lived there.” “Mrs. Fitzgerald’s Jim ”
had been known to all the country-side and river-
side people, and while many quietly laughed at,
all, at least apparently, deferred to her method of
training him. _ A storekeeper only, though she
might have coined wealth by joining a drink-
shanty to the store, she had always paid her way.
To do that and to bring Jim “ to A, sense of sin ’’
were her two ambitions. One other desire had
she—to keep from her boy the knowledge of his
father !
Men who did not hesitate to swindle her, yet
respected her wishes as regards Jim. Not for the
youngster’s sake, but for hers, they stripped their
blasphemy of its ornate blooms, and refrained
from telling yarns which are unprintable, and
singing songs that pollute the ear. They would
not teach him euchre, nor induct him into the
comparatively innocuous mysteries of “fifteen-
two, fifteen-four.” They even reduced, when in
his presence, the length of their snakes, and the
amount they had lost when Dan Morgan had
stuck them up. * They spoke of Jim among them-
selves as “Jim, the Vargin.” To his mother,
he was the child of many prayers, and as she
could not be blind or deaf to the difference in the
way the bullockies and bushies generally treated
her lad, and the way they treated others, she felt
the prayers would be answered sooner or later.
Were the rough fellows kept from tempting her
Jim, that was God—her God ! And surely, though
the signs were as yet uncertain, God’s mercy was
following, and He would be moved by her strenu-
ous stragglings to give unto her boy both the
“conviction of sin” and the grace that sustaineth
under the conviction, and that drives the penitent
to Christ.
And so, while Jim whistled in his care-free
youth, his mother wrestled in her agony for his
salvation.
# # *
When she was dying, her faith was un-
dimmed. She murmured that charter-song of the
Methodist who has “found peace
O Happy Day, that fixed my choice,
and pleaded that the Lord would bless her at the
last with the knowledge that Jim, too, “ could
read his title clear.” And Jim, wrought on by
his grief and his desire to grant unto her the one
consolation she craved, fancied, as so many others
have done, that the emotions of his impressionable
nature were the stirrings of the Spirit, and said
words to her and the Wesleyan minister who had
come from Corowa to her bedside that mads her
completely happy.
Waiting at the river-bank at Corowa to be
picked up by Mackintosh’s boat going down
stream with huge logs lashed fore and aft on
her hulking barge, h s fingered mechanically the
envelope in his pocket containing the draft. He
took it out and looked at it. From the folds,
dropped a bit of cardl oird. It was the “Society
Class-ticket of the people called Methodists.”
They had lost no time in enrolling him, and as he
looked at it, he recalled the whispered appeal
which had accompanied its issue to him “ Jimsey,”
said the class-leader, an old South-country man,
“ thee be motherless, now, lad, an’ I know ns wt o’
yer airthly father, but ye ’ast a Heavt nly one,
Jimsey —don’t never forgit that. An’ stick to th’
Class, lad—it’ll ’elp your soul mighty w’erever y’
be.” •
The words came back to him, borne, so it
seemed, on the rush of the current. They re-
minded him of his loss, and strangely drove in
upon his mind in a manner quite foreign,
to his ordinary experience that he had never
known his father. Father and mother and sister
and brother had the one parent he had known
been to him, and somehow, with that easy
acquiescence in things as they are which is so
characteristic of youth, he had never troubled
himself to specially inquire as to his father. The
district gossip allusively referred to Mrs. Fitz-
gerald as “ the widow ” as often as by her own
name, and he had taken the implication for a
granted fact. But, now, with the new routings in
his being of thought and reflection he pondered
over this gap in his personal history. Was hi?
father dead ? Then was it not singular that hi?
mother should not have spoken of him and hi?
resting-place?
Suppose he was not dead, but alive? Suppose,
further—the young man was gaining some insight
into life, and was becoming familiar with some of
the more vulgar aspects of family relationships—
that his father had abandoned his mother? Would
he, in that case, ever meet him ?
With the fervency of his new-born enthusiasm
for religious practices breathing upon him, what
more natural than that he should then and there
pray that he should meet his father, if his father
were still in the flesh? And he knew, in the
curious reflex action of spiritual exaltation, that
his prayer would be answered.
# * •
Carpet-bag in hand he sprang lightly
from the bank to the dingy which rowed in
shore for him. The dingy, on returning to the
steamer, was steered round the surging mass of
river drift-wood. Young Jim, still boyish in his
ways, dropped his disengaged hand into the water,
against the current. A tiny branch of the acacia,
laden with golden snow, the fluffy globules glisten-
ing dewily in their bath, was swept against his
fingers. He grasped it, and scarcely knowing
why he did so, withdrew it from the stream. As
he sprang on the decking of the steamer his im-
pulse was to throw the wattle back to the water.
But the hand of fate arrested the movement, and
a thought, new to him in its suggestiveness of
sentiment, arose.
Why should he not keep it as a memento of his
home-country? It would dry and shrivel, no
doubt, but it would still speak to him of the
Upper Murray country wherever he went. So
he retained it.
# * *
“ Now, my young cock’rel,” exclaimed the
mate, as he came up to the new passenger, ticket-
book in hand—Jimmy Macintosh, of the Echuca
sawmills, cannily Scotch in his ways, was careful
to demand vouchers for every trifling transaction
of his multifarious business —“ wot’s your name,
an’ w’ere ’re yer for ?”
“ Echuca,” answered the youth, “and James
Fitzgerald is my name.”
“ Oh, oh ! Jim Fitzgerald is it? an’ who’s yer
dad ?”
“ My father —but what’s that got to do with
you?”
“ Oh, nuthin’,” answered the brawny timber-
jigger, “ on’y our bargeman is named Jim Fitz-
gerald —an’ I b’leeve he comes from somew’eres
up this way.”
“My father is dead,” answered the lad, and
paying his sovereign for his fare, took the ticket
and turned away.
• • #
Timber-getting on the Murray, even when
varied by a little judicious evasion of the forest
regulations and a quiet bit of smuggling—not all
the tobacco smoked in Riverina paid border, or,
indeed, any duty—was a somewhat monotonous
life, and the steamer mate was but one of many
wtio would have seized upon such a trifle as the
coincidence of names of his bargeman and his
passenger to spin upon it jokes as to their sup-
posititious relationship. At the mid-day spell,

at the wheel of the barge,, so that he might go •
aboard the steamer for his snack, the mate was
fertile with chat—more fertile than delicate.
“ Hello, Jim ! ’ave you seen that young shaver
we’re takin’ down —the chap we picked up at
Corowa?” T , , ■
“No,” growled the bargeman, ‘an 1 don fc“
want to, neither.” - .
“Wal,” joked the other, shaking himself with
laughter, “that’s bad now, that is, consid rin as
he’s yer son.”
Fitzgerald, tall and lathy for all his year*, thin-
flanked, bushy-bearded, with eyes that _strove in
vain to look straight at men and things, was
pierced by the arrow shot at random.
“ What the do ye mean ?” he sharply said,
starting from the seat.
“Oh, nuthin’,” said the other—“on y yer go
and jest ask the chap—he ses as he s yer son !
Now, Fitzgerald the younger had said nothing
of the kind, but the humorous mate thought it an
element of fun to be unveracious. Strange that,
he should have thought so, for he had not culti-
vated his sense of humour in the city club smok-
ing-rooms, where they discuss reputations with a
regard for wit as pronounced as their disregard-
for truth !
With a repeated oath, the bargeman swung outc
of the cabin. “ He’d see, he would, what the
young blag’ard meant by sayin as he was
his son! ” As though the relationship when
proved would be a disgrace to him—him, the?
erstwhile gully-raker, ex-Cockatoo Island felon*
and present timber-getter.
The elder found the younger sitting-aft, gazings
at the rolling, swaying barge and wondering, in
the introspective fashion of youth, where this?
vovage of his was to lead him.
“I say, younker,” demanded the bargeman,.
“Who are you? An’ what d’ye mean by saying;
as you’re ray son ?” . , „
Shaken out of his reverie, the young fellow-
looked up wonderingly. . ,
•»I—I —said nothing of the sort! My father s
dead T And then a filmy reminiscence floated
like a vaporous cloud just within the horizon of
his experience, and through it loomed indistinctly ;
and undefined a bushy-bearded face, and hands•
that used to toss him to a horse’s mane.
“At least,” be stammered, “I always under- 1
stood so.” , . , ,
Face to face with the youth, the father knew
his son. There was the outline of his wife’s
features ;: something in his eyes of that clearness
of vision which had never failed to look straight
at things and at men, save when her husband had.
shamed her and when she bore vicariously his
disgrace. These he saw. Moreover, from the
heart of one the impalpable, irresistible shafts-
forged of kinship went to the heart of the other.
The father knew his son, the son knew his
father, and accepted the recognition as the answer
to his prayer. Such curious survivals does Nature
give us, first blurring or crossing them. The
mother had craved that her son might lean on
prayer as on a rock. The strain of her intense-
faith came up so far in him —and lo ! it had
worked to the destruction of her other great hope,
that he might never know his father. Of such
paradoxes is Life full.
# * *
Had there been in the minds of either the
faintest doubt as to the identity of the other, the
one feeble link needed to complete the chain oi
evidence would have been supplied by the branch
of dripping acacia which the yolinger Fitzgerald
held in his hand.
The father caught it, and the lore of the bush,
which seems to implant itself unconsciously in the
natures of men who are careless of its value,
■ prompting him to the enquiry : “ Where did you
get that wattle ?”
Not now the half-impertinent retort of youth ;
“ What business is that of yours?”—but the bare
truth.
“ I picked that up an hour ago.”
“ Did you? Why that is Turaberumba wattle !
/You can’t get that in these parts.”
“ I picked it out of the river as I was coming
-aboard.”
“Oh,” said the father, with an accent of dis-
appointment, “you didn’t pick it up near the
‘Tooma Creek?”
“ No,” said the other, “ just as I told you —but
it could have come down stream, you know.
Where is the Tooma? Doesn’t the Tooma run
into the Murray?”
“Why, that’s where you was born—between
- the Tooma and Tumberumba ! ”
Again the enquiry which yet to the questioner
seemed so unnecessary. “ How do you know
sfthat?”
For answer, “What was your mother’s name?”
- “Emma!” ,
The father received the shook, outwardly
'I unmoved. Did he not know it ?
“ Was she good—religious?”
• “She was a Wesleyan, and they thought a good
If lot of her.”
The words were convincing. _“ Come to the
Charge, I must have more talk with you,” said the
I elder.
% The steamer slackened a second to allow the
’A barge to draw up, and to be fended off when
father and son had leapt on its for’ard cargo.
’-‘They pursued their conversation, which meant so
to both, so fatally much to one, on the
wheel-platform.
The talk revealed many things to the man as
■fwoll as to the youth. He told his son how he had
; (.gone gold-digging, how., after years of failure,
had come in part, and how then he had
sought his home, but, to his dismay, found his
A wife and child missing. And the young Jim
swallowed the lie. “ I ain’t a-denyin’ it, my lad ”
—the rogue forced a paternal kindness into the
words —“I ain’t been as good a chap as I ought
to a’ been. I wasn’t never good nuff for your
mother.” Affecting repentance now, and sobriety
of behaviour and sppech, he did not jar upon the
lad, and won his liking insensibly.
* * •
Now, there was in existence at this epoch
of Riverine trading a practice which robbed the
Victorian railways of no inconsiderable portion of
their revenue. The system of making rebates or
refunds of freight on all goods carried over the
lines for destinations beyond the Wakool Junc-
tion, in order to attract the Lower Riverina trade
to Melbourne, supplied the reason for this prac-
tice—and the profit of it. The method of the
fraud need not bo told at the time of present
writing. Suffice it to say that big men made big
money by it. Some small men were ambitious of
doing the same. One of these latter was bargeman
Fitzgerald. When his son handed him undoubt-
ingly the bank-draft on Melbourne, he saw a way
to do it. He bought a share in a boat.
A railway clerk, a shipping agent’s clerk, and
at least a mate or bargeman—these were the tool's
necessary to the fraud. Fitzgerald himself could
look after*the boat’s share of the swindle; he had
the shipping agent’s clerk “readied up;” he
wanted but one more accessory : the railway clerk.
And here, in his son, he found that desideratum,
for it was an easy matter in those days for a river-
man well-known in Echuca to obtain for his son
a billet in Customs or railway. And Jim, junior,
had been not indifferently educated, and was soon
well up to the routine of cheeking way-bills and
freight invoices. In two months he was rebate
clerk —expert in checking and passing the sheets
on which shipping agents and boat-owners pre-
sented their claims for refunds. To distinguish
him from his father, who was-“ Jim Fitzgerald,
the Bargeman,” colloquially Jim,, junior, became
“Jim, the Rebater.” And the bargeman’s plans
throve right prosperously.
# * *
For some months they throve. And then
the mocking devil which lives in the core of every
ill-deed and forces it, from sheer derision, into the
light of day to become a thing abhorrent, prompted
Jim the Bargeman to reveal unto Jim the
Rebater a scheme for an unusually large haul of
fraudulent rebate vouchers. Then the boy, so far
an innocent tool—doing things in routine fashion
because others had done so and his superior officers
had told him to do it—awoke to the criminal
nature of his doings. He refused.
Several times he was pressed, but refused
always—swore, moreover, to inform the Station-
master of the roguery that went on under his nose
were he asked once more.
And .there was, the Bargeman thought, that
mother’s strain in his son’s blood which would
have made him carry out his threat in scorn of
consequences. So he would not press him further.
* » *
The great mills were busy. Night and
day were the giant saws going, tearing into beams
and planks and battens the spoil of New South
Wales forests, and shivering into the timber of com-
merce monster red gums with a breaking-weight of
lOjOOOlbs. to the square inch. And The boats were
busy, too, unloading the raw logs, loading with
the milled material. Jim’s barge lay under the
shoots up which the huge boles were chain-hauled
to slide down similar ways tobhe saw-beds. Jim
was guiding the chains one night when his boy
came down. The night was gloomy, and the
work was proceeding in the glare of big reflector
lamps which threw here broad splashes of bril-
liancy and there shadows as of midnight.
“ Good nig'ht, father ! 1 heard you were in and
came down to ”
“Well—what?” The Bargeman felt pretences
need scarcely be kept up longer.
“To say that I must tell Mr. Francis ’’—Francis,
now Acting-Commissioner, was stationmaster
then —“ of these rebate tricks.”
“ You’ve got vartuous all of a sudden.
Who’s put you up to this now?”
“ My mother’s memory !”
“Hell! ’Tis always your cantin’ hypocrite of
a mother. You’re gettin’ as big a sneak as she
was ! ”
“ My mother was a good woman —and I’m sorry
I can’t be as good. But I’ve been to Class ”
“What?” roared the father. “ Methody
Class ?”
“Yes!”
“ Damn you ! That means as you mean to give
me ’wajq do you ?”
* # #
The head of the shoots was in. a sheet of
darkness. Who can say what happened ? A slip
either sidq would precipitate the stumbler. On
the river-side, he could receive no injury but a
shaking. On the other
Jim the Rebater tripped—or was thrown. Thp
guiding chains slacked, but it was not the great
descending trunk that delivered the fatal blow.
The saw caught him first.

The Kanaka Paradise—By Bull’s
Daughter.
The London Times, which lately sent a special
lady correspondent to Australia to “consider”
the Kanaka slave-trade, has published the first
results of its representative’s mission. Her
decision, and that of the Times, as summarised
per cablegram, is that the Kanaka trade is
“ above the shadow of reproach,” and that
North Queensland is a Paradise for the South
Sea islander, a species of Promised Land where
the good Polynesian goes—a field of Asphodel
where a beatific nigger soars to higher and
better,,things while hoeing cane in an ideal cane-
brake for a boss who is but one remove from an
angel. As far as can be gathered from the
cabled summary, the Kanaka trade is altogether
too fair and spotless a thing for this sin-stained
earth. “Many of the plantations possess
schools, and nearly all of them have regular
concerts and sports.” The writer “never saw a
dejected Kanaka,” nor saw, nor heard of, any
instance in which a Polynesian “ was subjected
to drudgery.” And—here the correspondent
strikes the climax of eulogy—she has never
“seen the average white labourer so well off or
so comfortable. V\ hich, considering the state
of the average white labourer as seen in Eng-
land, sounds like an enthusiastic oongi atu.atiou
tendered to a lost soul in the third hell because he
isn t fried on quite so fierce a fire, and has
a better and more commodious gridiron tluiu
the lost soul of the seventh. Ihe toiler whose
state is only a little better than that of tue
British agricultiuist, is not a being to be envied,
and when that forlorn wretch is dragged in as a
means of comparison the presumption is that
hem the only individual that the writer can
think of whose condition is more wretched than
that of the recruited Kanaka M hen any-
body is congratulated on the fact that he is
bettor oil than ho would be m perdition, it
naturally suggests that perdition is the only
place where he could be worse off. Ihe brutal
Hodge, bond-slave of the squire and the Church
by Laxv Established, isn t actually in perdition,
but the life he leads is a \ ery fair substitute.
, * , ,
ine fact that the cable-agent Ims taken the
trouble to forward, and that the capitalistic
press of Australia has taken the trouble to
print, the views of the Times on this question,
plainly imply that these views are supposed to
be something of considerable weight. If the
Times’ opinion doesn’t actually settle the
whole problem it goes a long way towards
toing so. The Englishman, and the kind of
Australian who is even more English than the
Englishman, regards that massive and long-
discredited publication, the organ of Sampson’s
mendacities, and the poor tool of forger I’ioott,
as the final authority on all subjects under
Heaven. Yet the Times, after all, is only a
heavy country squire named Walter, and Co.,
and the views of the paper are only the views of
Walter and the other man or two. Neither
Walter nor the other man has ever, so far as
the world is aware, been either in Australia or
Polynesia. Neither of them, in all probability,
ever saw a Kanaka, or a Queensland sugar-
planter, or a canefleld, or a recruiting-agent, or
a South Sea slaver, or any other adjunct of the
unholy, bloodstained trade. Their correspon-
dent, who declares the recruiting business to
be without any shadow of reproach, has been
in Australia perhaps six, perhaps eight
weeks, perhaps even three months, and
has never visited the islands, nor seen the
recruiting industry carried on, nor sailed in a
slave ship, nor learned, except at second hand,
by the reports of interested parties, anything
whatever about the nefarious traffic. She could
speak none of the native dialects, and, there-
fore, her reports necessarily represent one side
of the case only. But she was duly accredited
to Samlkl Griffith (the man who, in other
days, denounced the South Sea slave-trade as
forever accursed, and gave reasons for his
denunciation which are as good as new
to-day), and asked him if the trade which he
had re-created was in any way objection-
aide, and if he was really the author of a
system of murder, piracy and wholesale kidnap-
ping, whereupon he enthusiastically responded
in the negative. Also, she visited sundry show-
plantations as an honoured guest—which was
practically the same as the accused standing
champagne for the Judge—when everything
was prepared for her reception, and the diseased
nigger was, of course, removed out of sight, and
the bruised nigger was put away in the back-
ground (for who would be so rude as to show
such sights to a lady ?), and the sound and pre-
sentable nigger had been instructed to smile for
his life, and wear all the look of profound happi-
ness that he could muster. And out of such
materials is constructed that unbiassed public
opinion which the daily press lays on in every
household as if it were a public water-supply
or a gas-service.
# « *
The Times, in its anxiety to whitewash the
capitalists of Queensland and that great Im-
perialist statesman, Sir Samuel Griffith,
K.C.M.G., has convicted itself out of its
own mouth. There is not—that is the
assertion in the cablegram—in North Queens-
land, among all the Polynesians whom the
Times representative passed in review, even
one dejected face. And following this comes
the statement that the Kanaka’s condition is
“ better than that of the English agricultural
labourer.” Truly, if the first statement is true
then the Kanaka’s condition is better than that
of the British House of Lords, better than that
of all the monarchs of Europe, better by far
than that of all the statesmen and millionaires
of this earth, and only about one shade worse
than that of. the angels. And if only the second
assertion is true, then the islander is just one
remove, and no more, from Gehenna. The dis-
crepancy between the two ends of the descrip-
tion is altogether too awful. The Kanaka is
happier, so far as outward appearances go, than
it is given to any mere human being to be on
this earth—also, he is better off than if he were
being killed by starvation and slow, hopeless,
incurable, long-drawn-out misery. He is more
joyful than any man or woman on record out-
side Elysium—also, it is the general opinion
that he is more comfortable than if he was
being grilled over a slow fire. It is a lame
and unspeakably impotent conclusion, and
the method by which it was arrived at is the
same by which the Times arrived at many
similar conclusions in the past. By an almost
identical process that paper, when it sought as
the mouthpiece of English capitalism to blast
out the foundations of the great Republic,
decided that the blood-boltered African slave
of the Confederate States was an ideal nigger
leading a butterfly existence among the mag-
nolias—a joyous child of nature singing and
dancing gaily in a Paradise that was located
somewhere on the dreary, clay banks of the Red
River. It resolved in the same way —viz., by
taking the unbiassed opinion of the parson and
the squire—that the English Hodge is and
always has been a contented and prosperous
peasant ; and it has learned—from the absentee
landlord and the rack-renting agent—that the
Irish agriculturist is a being absolutely without
grievances of any kind whatsoever. When the
Times starts out to explain away a great wrong
the results can be compared to no literary pro-
duction on the face of the earth—save, per-
haps, the prospectus of the late Mr. Walk ford
Sqeers’ academy.
* # %
If the “great” English journal desires to pene-
trate the mysteries of the Kanaka traffic, it must
proceed on an entirely differentsystem. It should
first catch a lady absolutely destitute of precon-
ceived opinions and have her taught the liquid
dialect of some of the South Sea archipelagoes.
Then she should be painted black in enduring
colours, and clothed chiefly in a disused sack,
and be recruited in due form so that she might
be inducted into the inner life of the Kanaka in
happy Queensland. And after that she could
study at leisure the method of recruiting, and the
manner in which the recruit is sold by his
alleged friends and relatives and chiefs to
Griffith’s slave-dealers ; the morality of cap-
tains, mates, and Government agents; the
system under which the island women are
not recruited unless accompanied by their
husbands ; the relations between captain
and agent, the extent to which the latter
acts as a check upon the former, and the
reasons for believing that he isn’t paid a com-
mission in consideration of a judicious silence
upon many subjects (as was invariably the case
in the good old days) ; the manner in which an
inspector, who doesn’t know the native lan-
guage, and an interpreter, who is often equally
ignorant, assure themselves that all is honest
and above-board ; the joys of life on a labour
schooner, also the victuals, the odours, the dis-
cipline, the orgies carried on by tltfc Officers,
and the manner in which all hands conduct
themselves towards the good-looking Polynesian
maiden when they get liei' on board. Further’
she would gather much valuable information
about plantation life, about the drunks, the
lights, the doings of the suave boss and over-
seer when they are not being inspected by an
influential lady visitor, the food, the hospital
system, the consumptives who are said to work in
the sugar-houses when they are too dilapidated
for further labour in the cane-fields, the reasons
why there are on an average about two female
to a hundred and twenty male recruits
(that was the proportion in the very last
slaver which arrived at Bundaberg), and the
physical and moral consequences thereof, the
causes whereby the Kanaka —said to be specially
adapted to tropical agriculture—dies off (as per
Queensland official statistics, mind you) from
three to seven times as fast as the white inhabit-
ants—who are supposed not to be similarly
adapted ; the curious absence of any effective
inquiry into this tremendous mortality ; and
many kindred topics. And when the inquiry
is finished, and the Times has rescued its bruised
and damaged correspondent from her “master,”
that paper will be able, for the first time, to
speak on the Kanaka question as one having
authority.
# # #
But even if, after all this investigation, it is
demonstrated that the Polynesian is supremely
content with his lot, and that hoeing cane at
€6 per annum is a foretaste of Paradise, it
makes absolutely no difference in the situation.
The Times may paint the slave-trader and gild
the refined Kanaka till the end of history, but
it thereby merely evades the real issue. The
islander may be happy in Queensland, just as
the Jew sweater may be happy in England, and
the Russian invader, if he ever arrives, may be
happy in London when he is looting that golden
city, and as the leper may be quite content any-
where, but Queensland was not built expressly
as a haven of refuge for any cheap foreign
labourer, whatever the English press, which
regards our country as England’s private pro-
perty and a mere stamping-ground for exploita-
tion, may think to the contrary. If the Times,
or any other foreign paper, is prepared to
demonstrate that the white labourer in Queens-
land is contented, well-fed, and prosperous,
that his lot in that Kanaka-ridden land is
“above the shadow of reproach,” and that
there is no dejected white man, as well as no
dejected Polynesian, to be found in the land,
then the question may be regarded as settled.
If it is not prepared to prove this, then even
though the South Sea islander should die of joy
at Bundaberg, the trade is just about as
nefarious as it was before in the days when the
rum-soaked Queensland pirates of the Hopeful
let out the life-blood of Johnny Malk oeo on
the high seas.
The Modern Bastille.
At first sight, it looks quite disinterested
for the New South. Waks “vested interest”
party to object to the abolition of imprisonment
for debt, for it is up to the neck in debt itself.
But the fat man’s debt is not necessarily the
sort of debt which involves imprisonment under
the local'law. A writ of c«. so. doesn’t touch
the church deacon who has borrowed the
washerwoman’s savings at eight per cent on a
promissory-note that will be dishonoured at
maturity. He is all right. If she is reasonable,
and makes no fuss, he will square it for seven-
and-six in the £. If she is cantankerous and
takes out a writ, then he delays her for six
months by filing a lying defence. At the end of
that time, supposing she has not come to grief
on a legal snag and gets her judgment, he files
his schedule. His bogus creditors roll up, and
vote that he be allowed his furniture, including
the grand piano and the walnut dining-room
suite bought with the washerwoman’s money,
and she gets a dividend of one and a penny-
farthing. He doesn’t go to gaol. That is not
what is meant in New South Wales by im-
prisonment for debt.
* # •
But if the washerwoman throws the thirteen-
pence-farthing at the deacon’s head, and tells
him the truth about himself—that he is a flat-
footed swindler, then the law of imprisonment
for debt at once begins to operate. She is sued
for slander, and the deacon employs two eiftinent
Q.C.’s and an assorted variety of other lawyers.
The Judge directs the jury to find for plaintiff;
and when they assess the damage to his char-
acter at a farthing, certifies for costs, amount-
ing to £1392 4s. Bd. Whereupon the woman
has to go to gaol for twelve months, unless she
can pay that sum—which she can’t—and bank-
ruptcy won’t help her to get out of gaol; nor
will it ever enable her to get clear of the
liability after she has served her year in prison.
That, in brief, is the New South Wales law of
imprisonment for debt. It is a law to imprison
every man who unsuccessfully defends a
defamation action, unless he has money. It
doesn’t touch the man who incurs a debt that
he never means to pay and knows he can’t pay.
W hich is the reason that the fat man approves
of it.
* * #
It is a mistake to suppose that the repeal of
this law would take away the only means of
punishing the penniless defamer, who recklessly
circulates malicious slanders. The lawyer who
says that that would bo the effect of the repeal
is either lying or is ignorant of the law. The
Bixlktin does not and never did advocate any
law to allow false and wanton libels to be pub-
lished with impunity. It is possible to injure a
man just as cruelly by attacking his character
as by knocking him down and jumping on his
stomach ; and the miscreant who" makes the
one attack should be liable to be dealt with in
just the same way as the ruffian who makes the
other. The criminal law accordingly provides
exactly the same means of dealing with both of
them. The individual who has been assailed,
cither in character or-in person, can lay an in-
formation against his assailant; and on the
charge being proved the law awards a punish-
ment supposed to be proportionate to the
gravity of the offence.
* # m
But this punishment is not intended as a
salve for the wounded feelings of the prosecutor,
or as a means of gratifying his desire for re-
venge. Our law does not recognise the right of
an injured man to retaliate on his aggressor,
r l hat is to say, it does not recognise such a right
except in the one instance of defamation. The
general principle is, ostensibly at least, that the
criminal law exists for the purpose of punishing
offences against the community, and offences
against individuals in so far only as they are
injurious to the community, with a view to dis-
couraging'the commission of such offences. The
injured individual’s right is confined, not to
retaliation, but to reparation. And that he
must seek through civil process. The two
things are sharply distinguished in principle,
and should be kept so in practice the
criminal law to punish the offence in the
interests of the community; the civil law to
award compensation for the injury done to the
individual. If a man have his health damaged
by a kick from his friend, he is entitled to
recover out of his friend’s property a sum
sufficient to make reparation for the damage.
But he is not entitled to glut his vengeance by
putting the other in gaol. That is a matter
solely within the province of society at large,
represented by the Attorney-General, or who-
ever the public prosecutor may, be. And, in
this instance, practice conforms to theory. The
plaintiff with the pounded stomach may obtain
a verdict for £lOOO damages, and if the defen-
dant’s property will produce that much under
execution, the plaintiff gets the money. But if
the defendant’s belongings do not amount to a
thousand farthings, the plaintiff is not allowed
to console himself for his disappointment by
thrusting his debtor into a dungeon and keeping
him there.
* # #
Why should there be any other system in the
case of a libel ? A libel may or may not be
a graver offence than an assault. It may be a
deliberate and abominable outrage ; it may be
a harmless slip of the pen requiring a great
strain to make it defamatory even in a technical
sense. If the offender is to be punished, the
punishment should be apportioned by a proper
tribunal after the same sort of enquiry as would
be held on any other criminal charge. We can
best show what is done by giving an instance.
The Bulletin has occasionally made mistakes
and has faced the music. Unwarrantable
statements get into all papers at times, and
when we have been clearly in the wrong we
have taken our gruel without a whimper. But
once in its early days The Bulletin defended
a libel-action, and the jury awarded the plain-
tiff a farthing damages. Had The Bulletin
proprietors been put on their trial criminally
for that libel, before a tribunal that took a
similar view, they would have been found guilty
and imprisoned for about ten seconds. Yet, under
the N.S. W. law, because the Judge certified for
costs that totalled up more than the proprietors
were worth, they were sent to gaol for a year.
They didn’t stay there for quite a year ; but that
was not the fault of the law. In point of fact,
they were fined a farthing for the libel, and
sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for
not being able to pay u lawyer’s bill.
* * #
On the other hand, the penniless adventure',
who brings a foundationless blackmailing action
against a newspaper runs no such risk if be
fails. He cannot be gaoled for not paying the
defendants’ lawyer’s bill. They have to pay
the piper themselves, and no law steps in to
give them the gratification of taking it out of
his hide. The law of so-called imprisonment
for debt is kept alive solely for the purpose of
enabling persons to be punished as criminals
for an offence of which no jury could find
them guilty if they were charged with it in the
criminal dock. It is a law by which a man can
be kept in gaol for a year for want of a five-
pound note. It is the apotheosis of the scanda-
lous fine -or - imprisonment system. “ Forty
shillings or a month ”is bad enough. It is a
sieve, adjusted to let the kid-gloved criminal
through every time, while it catches the in-
dividual that ‘ ‘ society ” objects to. “ A farthing
and costs, or twelve months,” ;s built on the
same lines, only more so. The Bulletin’s
views on this question sum up shortly thus :
The gaols should lie kept for criminals. Before
anyone, even a newspaper-man, is sent to gaol
as a criminal, he should be put on his trial, and
given the same privileges as a bank-robber or a
murderer; and, if found guilty, he should be
set to do his time on hominy whether he is a
gutter-snipe or a millionaire. Further, no man
in the country should be allowed to keep
another in prison to gratify his private spite.
Or, if it is to be allowed, let the thing be carried
out systematically, and give us a good, frank,
wholesome system of leftres de cachet’ and a new
Bastille.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shiels's Latest.
Victoria seems mildly excited by the discovery
that Premier Shiels, the uncompromising
Patriot of Casterton, has worked another job
upon his adopted country. The job itself is
small and much less contemptible than the
effort made to prove Shiels -a man of unim-
peachable honour in the transaction. Some
months ago, Dr. Pearson, who was more or
less a victim of the Victorian land-boom orgy,
went to London. Seeing that London had no
pressing need of Pearson’s services, it was
naturally supposed that the Government in-
tended to. do something for this pal of the
almighty Ace, and Shiels was asked, point-
blank, whether he intended to solace Pearson
in his misfortune with the sinecure billet of
Secretary to the Agent-General, recently made
vacant by the decease of a barnacle. Shiels
replied that the Government had neither the
intention of shoving Pearson into this £IOOO a
year snuggery, nor the intention of filling it
with anyone—at present. “ At present ” is a
contested clause in the Shiels shuffle. The
general idea is that Shiels forgot to say
“ at present,” for the reason that : any sug-
gestion of ever again chucking away this
£IOOO a year would have sounded out of har-
mony with Shiels’ burning desire for retrench-
ment at the time in question. Whatever the
exact wording of the Premier’s “explanation”
may have been, it was clearly his intention to
deny that Dr. Pearson had left Australia on


“I
time.”
break with all the maxims of my
’—Rousseau.
the strength of a Government situation in store
for him at “’Ome.” Wherefore Shiels pru-
dently waited for the holiday recess before he
ventured to formally appoint Pearson to the
position that wasn’t to be filled —at present.
The Age authorities probably advised this as
the most respectable way of “working it.”
Shiels had to tell what would be called a lie
in ordinary business circles, and it was best
told by degrees, so to speak. The resigna-
tion of Agent-General Munro, following
Aose noon the Pearson incident, sheds
another dab of mud on the Victorian Crown.
Shiels has contradicted the report that
Munro was coming back for good, until one
m-ew heartily sick of his miserable juggling
with facts. Munro returned to Melbourne
with the yarn that he had just run over on a
holiday (bringing bis wife and family with him),
ind four days later it was announced in the
Argus that the Hon. James had decided to
resign the Agent - Generalship, because the
climate of London didn't agree with his con-
stitution. And this decision was to be solemnly
communicated to Shiels (who had gone out in
a, steam-launch to meet him on his arrival)
as soon as possible. Nobody, save Shiels,
professed to think there was the slightest
possibility of Munro retaining the Agent-
Generalship. Everybody, except Shiels,
knew that Hr. Pearson was to step into the
sinecure billet at the Agent-General’s office.
Either, then, must Premier Shiels be a drifting
simpleton, or he must take the public of Vic-
toria for idiots. And if they tolerate Shiels
for another three months the public of Victoria
will appear even more helpless idiots than their
Premier probably takes them to be.
♦—
Speaking of the Mercantile Bank and other
troubles in Melbourne, the local smileless
Punch sternly remarks :
It was not well done on the part of Jack Murray to
make that incriminatory speech of his in Parliament. It
is true that he voiced the general community ; but it was
a speech for the prosecution made in a place where no
defence could be offered. That is not a piece of British
fair play.
Which, when you follow it to its logical con-
clusion, just amounts to this : Nobody must
expose a foul wrong in Parliament unless the
doer of the wrong is there and in a position to
answer the charges. No one is allowed to
answer a charge in Parliament unless he
is a member of that honourable body.
Therefore when a piece of irredeemable
blackguardism is perpetrated by anybody
the perpetrator must straightway be elected a
member of the House before the Legislature
can move in the matter, and when all the con-
spicuous swindlers have been so elected there
will be no honest man in the House to expose
anything. They are fearfully and wonderfully
anxious to temper the wind to the shorn bogus
banker down in Melbourne. Yet, when Punch
publishes its weekly howl against trades-
unionists and their leaders it never stops to
consider that it is denouncing them in a place
where no defence can be offered. Further, the
sickening wheeze about “ British fair play ” is
being done to death. What’s the matter with
Australian fair play ? If there isn’t any fair-
play except the imported article it is time a
duty were put on it to encourage local pro-
duction.
A miserable caricature of the Imperial Army
jobbery and fiddledeedce that one finds solemnly
recorded in Truth or the World, popped up
in a Melbourne paper the other day : —“ Lieu-
tenant* George Chjrnside, of the Horse Artil-
lery, has been promoted to a captaincy.’ It
is true that the average Victorian has never
heard of the Horse Artillery, and never wants
to. It is also true that Chirnside’s pay as
captain will not trouble his bleeding country to
any appreciable extent, because he probably
gets no more than when he was a lieutenant,
and perhaps he only got nothing at all then.
But to the mock soldier there must be some
extra glory in the rank of eaptain. Therefore,
as George Chirnside talked of abandon-
ing Hie job ot supporting a few cannons and
sufficient men to keep them loaded, and as the
Hopetouns honoured him with a visit and
exhorted him to stick to his blessed guns.
Lieutenant George gets his tin-pot promotion.
That’s all,.
Anarchy.
Editor Bulletin,—As some people know, I am
an anarchist. I was one of the first persons jn
Australia to join this movement, becoming a
member of the Melbourne Anarchists 5 Club in
188(i. The opinions promulgated at that time
differed, however, from my present views in the
fact that the application of the basic principle
(individual autonomy) was more limited. We
formulated, in our platform, the abolition of law
and the State, and also of rent, profit, and interest,
but adhered to the idea of wages, prices, and
ownership; and those who preferred communistic
methods to the rigid system of exchange at
“labour cost” favoured by the majority, did so
on the grounds of expediency or of vague senti-
ment. In 1888 I perceived that ownership (with-
out which there would be, strictly speaking,
neither wages nor prices) was simply a conven-
tional law or restriction, and modified my ideas
in accord with this discovery. Then, ascertaining
that the views as altered were held by the modern
Communist Anarchist party of Europe, I adopted
that distinguishing designation. Communism in
this sense, which agrees strictly with its literal in-
terpretation, is really synonymous with absolute
individualism, although the latter term is almost
monopolised by the upholders of Property. I was,
so far as I can ascertain, the first person in any
part of the world to demonstrate the essentiality
of Communism to Anarchy, and establish it
logically on an anarchistic basis.

What is Anarchy ? Well, in the first place, I
decline to acknowledge the claim of anyone else to
dictate to me what I shall or shall not do. My
body is constructed by Nature to move under the
impulsion of the brain and nerves which form part
of it, not of those which form part of somebody
else, and I do not propose to shut them up and
hitch on to anybody else’s, at any rate unless he
can do the feeling and suffering for me as well as
the choosing of .a course. And, were I to do so,
I should simply be committing moral suicide in
order to endow him with an additional body to
use (if lie were so disposed) in forcing others to
follow bis will rather than their own. In that
case I should be a standing menace to society, just
as a Gatling-gun would be, and it is highly painful
to me to conceive of myself as being so._ There-
fore, I decline to abnegate my self-will in favour
of anyone who insists on my conforming either to
a formulated command or to a custom. I am
myself, and I am going to be myself as emphati-
cally as possible.
* # •
In the second place, with special regard to
ownership (which is the conventional privilege
accorded to the owner of dictating to everybody
else whether and on what terms something may
be availed of) and its derivatives, viz., wages,
prices, and the whole superstructure of capitalism,
I make this observation. Here we have a race of
beings who, unlike all other living things, imagine
they have no right to avail themselves of anything
whatever, saving certain exceptions in favour of
individuals with respect to particular things, and
fully half their energies are employed in the one
task of shifting the incidence of the taboo.
Naturally, the inconvenience is such that each
tries to get as many objects, or as large a propor-
tion of them, as possible, into the position of not
being tabooed to him, but that is, under the
system, synonymous with prohibiting everyone
else from as much as possible, and thus the actual
utility of all objects, except some for strictly
personal consumption, is reduced to the minimum,
and the amount of labour required to achieve a
given result of utility increased to the maximum.
# * #
In a condition of Anarchy, I should devote
myself, in the first instance, to works directly
beneficial to myself, and when I was not doing
so, and had the energy to spare, I should expend
it in the labours that were most congenial to me
for the benefit of others, as occasion arose, with
no thought of demanding reward from them for so
doing, because I should know that anybody would
be ready to assist me just as freely when I re-
quired any aid —and similarly in respect of goods,
which would be available to anyone at need. Thus
brotherly hell fulness would take the place of
bargain-driving, and labours would be automati-
cally divided according to congeniality ; and it is
safe to say that people’s faculties would be more
evenly exercised, and that each would acquire a
wide experience and skill, instead of each having
one faculty jaded and the rest atrophied, as at
present.
J. A. ANDREWS
(A Leading Sydney Anarchist.)
To attain to this ideal it is only necessary that
those wh,o accept it should put it in practice
among themselves, and, as far as possible, also
towards those who have not yet accepted it, while
conscientiously maintaining their own autonomy
in the measure of their power to do so. Simple
friendship and good will are capable of enabling
the last almost as easily as the first of these
to be effected in the majority of instances,
but, in some cases, the attempt to ignore laws and
privileges will be met or followed by violence on
the part of the adherents of the old system. Then,
of course, force in opposition will haye to be used,
unless the defensive purpose can be equally well
effected by evasion. But as we cannot live ac-
cording to Anarchy and according to the present
system at the same time, the policy of the future,
as soon as the ideas are sufficiently rooted in the
people, will be in the main to cease looking to
employment or trading in any form for the means
of subsistence, and settle upon the lands without
asking leave or paying tribute, in small groups
having communistic relations internally and
among each other, and, as far as practicable,
limiting their transactions with the outer world
also to dealings of a communistic character, This,
carried on internationally, will constitute so large
a drain on the profit-yielding population as to
reduce commercial values to nil, and the acquired
resources of civilisation, left in temporary idle-
ness, can then be “jumped ” by those who need,
not to appropriate, but to use them. On account
of the same draining process the possibility of
sparing men from the dwindling party of the pre-
sent system, to attempt to re-institute it by force,
will be, as also that of maintaining them, con-
stantly less and less, so that at least the later
stages of the Revolution will be comparatively if
not wholly bloodless.
# # #
In conclusion, I believe from experience (and
mine has been harder and more ruled by fraud and
tyranny than most people’s) that the deepest in-
stinct implanted in the human breast is that ex-
pressed in the words “ Do unto others as ye would
have them do unto you,” and when the fetters of
law, conventionality, and religion are broken, it
will find its way into action. — J. A. Andrews.

A Stone.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was midnight in the claim as elsewhere. Ihe
stars were obscured, the wind was blowing
furiously. A large lantern burned irregularly
beside a short, broad - shouldered man, who
was guiding the nozzle. He was a miner, taking
advantage of the heavy rain—a common practice
on the diggings. , .
Occasionally a flash of lightning illumined the
scene. The iron piping swelled like varicose veins
under the awful strain. The increasing water
strained the rivets with the pressure. The
cylindrical tube seemed to breathe.
Suddenly it burst with a loud report. The iron
tore like a rag, and the water hurled the pro-
prietor into the tail-race. A wild yell, stifled at
its loudest moment, rang out across the camp.
We grasped our moleskins and dragged them
on. We slid into our boots, snatched a lantern,
and hurried to the spot. We found the unfortu-
nate owner in the centre of the slush. His eyes
and ears were full of sediment, so was his mouth.
We harried down with him, and wrapped him in
hot blankets. He threw up a quantity of sand
and water, and soon fell asleep. He was appar-
ently well in the morning.
But in a few days an unnatural pallor settled on
his face. Symptoms of jaundice appeared, and
the poor fellow presently expired. At the post-
mortem the cause of death was given as a stone in
the stomach. Now, that stone was the size of an
egg, and was of aqueous formation. It belonged
to the family of sedimentary rocks. It had been
swallowed during the fright.
How was it gulped down ? Under no ordin-
ary circumstances could such a lump have
been swallowed. Neither is gastric juice favour-
able to cement. It is, therefore, certain that when
the accident took place, the stone was thrown
into the mouth, the cold water contracted the
inner muscles of the throat, a wild, mad gulp of
fear caused a momentary expansion of the gullet,
and it had been forced down. For the time being
the man was a veritable stork, which bird has for
its throat a tube, resembling indiarubber in elas-
ticity. The apparently impossible may occur in
the human body.

POLYPE.
The real Cause of the challenge sent by
Kingston, Q.C., to the portly and pompous Baker,
C.M.G., in Adelaide, was a suspicion that the
latter had something to do with the sudden depar-
ture, on a month’s leave, of Railway-Chairman
Smith. The Legislative Council lately appointed
a committee to enquire into certain special vvheat-
rates secretly made by the Railway
for the benefit, apparently, of a few milling firms
that desired to keep local prices down by import-
ing Victorian grain, and, by Chaffey Baker’s infill:
ence, it is averred, the report indirectly accused
Kingston, who was Acting-Premier when the rates
were agreed to, of telling a falsehood. At his re-
quest the Assembly appointed a Commission to
consider the report and evidence of the Council s
committee, and Smith, of course, would be an
important witness. Kingston arid Baker were
colleagues in Ministerial office eight years ago.
but since that date there has been deadly feud
between them, and during the last few days of the
just-expired session they have, from their vantage
spots in each House of Legislature, flung fierce-
toned defiance at each other. Baker called King-
ston a bully, a coward, and a disgrace to
the legal profession. Kingston accused Bak rof
being politically “a public defaulter,” a slanderer,
and various other unreliable and perfidious
things. For days Kingston brooded over
the accusation of cowardice, and at last,
the announcement of Smith’s departure being the
last straw, he sat down and wrote a challenge.
He had first been round the gunsmith’s shops to
find two revolvers exactly alike —one of these,
with a packet of cartridges, he enclosed in the
ietter to Baker, and put the other in his pocket.
The missive began thus: “So, Smith is going
away for a month, and you are trying to burke
the enquiry.” Then, after some very outspoken
criticisms, it went on to say that, as the
post - office chimed the half - hour after one
(on Friday, Dec. 23) he would emerge
from Victoria Square, just opposite Baker’s
office, while Baker was at the same time to leave
his own door. They were then to advance towards
each other across the street, the signal to com-
mence firing being when either stepped from the
footpath on to the street. They were to fire after-
wards as quickly and in whatever manner they
liked, “until one of us goes out.” The request
was made that no innocent third party should be
brought into the matter. Kingston kept his
engagement to the second, but, instead of
Baker, was confronted by four plain-clothes
policemen, brought to the spot by Baker’s
son, to whom the letter had been shown.
Baker alleges that he drove up from the
Adelaide Club to his office a minute before, the
time agreed upon with the revolver and cartridges
in his pocket ready to defend himself, but he must
have known that the officers were already waiting
to seize his opponent, who did not see him. Kings-
ton was in dead earnest, and when the writer said
to him, “ Well, what will be the upshot of this?”
he replied, “ I don’t know, but whatever it may
be I had prepared myself for worse.” When
asked whether he did not feel pretty sure that
information would be given to the police, he
answered: —“Well, no, I didn’t think Baker
was such a cur.” He had very
great provocation, which was all the more likely
to work upon him because of his blood—he is on
his father’s side Irish, and Spanish on his mother’s;
while, as a soldier, be could hardly brook being
called a coward. It would have been wiser, how-
ever, had he had recourse to the horsewhip or
fists. In this Baker might have acted as his
exemplar, for in 1867, when a vigorous youth, he
thrashed a parson-journalist who is stated to have
written that Hon. John Baker, C.M.G., father of
Chaffey, induced a number of black gins to dance
in a state of nudity before the Duke of Edinburgh.
Kingston and Baker are both big men and in pretty
good physical condition, and if the contest
could be'arranged between them in aid of the
Broken Hill relief fund, the proceeds ought to be
very large. Whatever the result of the bout,
there would be a grim satisfaction in making Baker
and his friends contribute even in an indirect way
to this deserving object. The Government, after-
first taking the whole matter out of the hands of
the police, were in a quandary as to what action
should be instituted, Baker, in order to embarrass
them, throwing all the responsibility on their
shoulders. The Premier was away in Melbourne,
and the whole decision of the matter rested with
Homburg, Attorney-General and acting Premier,
who was a colleague of Kingston’s in the last
Playford Government, and who keenly felt the
awkwardness of his position, more especially as
he knew that Baker was eagerly waiting to take
advantage of any slip he might make. Peters-
wald, Commissioner of Police, is a member of thu
same club as Mr. Baker.

Lyceum “ Little Red Riding Hood.’
Garrick “ Pink Dominoes."
Opera House Harry Rickards.
Carrington Grounds Fillis’ Circus.
York Street Rink Wirth’s Colossal Circus.
Coogbb Aquarium.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's ‘‘The Forty Thieves.”
Royal “ Babes in the Wood.”
Opera House “Snared.”
Alexandra “ Lady Audley’s Secret.”
Sydney Garrick is looking a little less
empty and desolate this week, and “ Pink
Dominoes” is on the bill. At the same time it
seems hard to believe that all the world used to
howl with mirth over this same comedy. “Pink
Dominoes ” was done to death and ashes years
ago, and when its rouged and plastered face looks
out from the programme it suggests the paralysed
grandmother of the ballet doing a last hop on the
road to the sepulchre. No old play-goer can
laugh heartily at the piece now unless some one
stands over him with a club to make him do it.
The strength of the Garrick Co. consists, as
before, of Messrs. Diver, Sterling Whyte and
Cannam —particularly of the two former. Misses
Alice May and Flora Hastings are also extenuat-
ing circumstances, but the rest of the party suffers
from some petrifying complaint which is probably
incurable. The case isn’t one for medical science,
but in The Bulletin’s opinion the
show ought to be diagnosed by a
timber-merchant.

Meston’s freshly-caught canni-
bals are on view at Bondi Aquarium,
and a fearsome crowd they are.
They are mostly of great size, and
a few are of alarming ugliness, but,
taken as a whole, they are more
beautiful than might have been
expected. The Australian who has
gone out into the wilds and success-
fully stood off the circumjacent
heathen in his lair, where he is
present in great quantities and
anxious for slaughter, has generally
returned to describe him as a bow-
legged horror with no neck and a
gnarled and crooked back, but
Meston’s specimens are all well-
shaped and reasonably graceful.
They are alleged to include samples
of the Oirakillas, Kitoondas,
Coongarries, Wookas, Injalahjos,
Eeas, Owanzillas, and other un-
speakable tribes, and some particu-
larly stern and beetle-browed ruffians
come from the spinifex desert, and
have the dust of the wilderness
still in their hair. They are all
partially clothed and vociferous,
and the atmosphere at Bondi is
full of spears, boomerangs, nulla-
nullas, war-dances, devil-dances,
mask-dances and frantic corrob-
boree. A long letter from a
well-meaning correspondent about
the spiritual prospects of the
aborigines is crowded out.

Sydney Royal was announced
to re-open last Monday with
“Falka,” Miss Clara Merivale
being manageress and star performer. On the
previous Friday, however, George Rignold, who
claims to own the Australian rights of that not
too cheerful opera, obtained a legal injunction and
put his boot down on the show'. Consequently
the Royal hangs fire, and both parties are ex-
plaining violently in the papers, or their friends
are explaining for them. The lady’s story seems
to be that she is cr-r-rushed by the iron hoof of
oppression and that a bad and jealous man has
applied the torch to her prospects and burnt her
to the ground ; and the other side of the case sets
forth that Mr. Rignold is a long-suffering manager
who only asserted himself when he found a pre-
suming female going bald-headed for his copyright
and adding insult to premeditated injury. Mean-
while, “Falka” is in abeyance.

Premier Dibbs having withdrawn his pro-
hibition and declared the strike “off,” Miss
Jasia Scherazade’s lion performance is again one
of the attractions at Fillis’s Circus. It now tran-
spires that Sir G. Republican Dibbs had not seen
the exhibition when he issued his ukase; some
hysterical person had told him about it, and on
that second-hand evidence he straightway pro-
ceeded to close up the industry wlureby a good-
looking and deserving lady gained her livelihood.
As he now tacitly acknowledges that he made a
B articular fool of himself in so doing, The
ULLETIN wants to know if he has apologised to
the lady for his wildly-irresponsible conduct, or if
he sees his way to compensating anybody ? The
story of his cave-in is instructive. When the pro-
hibition was first issued, Miss Scherazade called
on Premier D. in ordinary walking dress, but
found him adamant. But later on Dibbs was
lured to the circus, where the lady is alleged to
have appealed to him in fancy costume, and when
she backed him into the corner between the laugh-
ing hyena and the baboon with the white whiskers,
and laid the matter before him in full, he fell back
heavily against the snake-cage and gave up right
there.

Both the Sydney pantomimes are on the
high tide of prosperity, and the Shakespearean
comedy at the Criterion is doing better business
than that revered but ruinous dramatist has done
in Australia for many days. Rickards’ Minstrel
Go. and Wirth’s Circus at the York-street
skating-rink are also paying speculations at pre-
sent, and though it seems almost certain that,
among all these shows, at least one must burst at
an early date owing to the general insolvency of
the city, the question of where the burst will take
place seems as far from settlement as ever. Pro-
fessor John Macmahon has just completed a series
of six medical lectures at the Royal Standard on
“ The new Science of Healing without Drugs or
Operations,” and lias gone on tour in the northern
towns.

The Liliputian Opera Co. is running fie
pantomime of “ Aladdin ” at Adelaide Royal to
very good houses, but the performance would be
more comprehensible if its “localisms” did not
belong to places many hundreds of miles away
from Saintopolis. At Hudson’s Bijou, Emerson’s
Minstrels are doing fairly well with ancient Martin
Simonsen in front.

The baneful influence of Christmas in
Victorian not N.S.W. —postal arrangements,
combined with the after-effects of pudding upon
a shattered telegraph system, prevented a full
notice of Melbourne’s Yuletide shows from appear-
ing in last Bulletin.

One week’s experience of “ The Forty
Thieves,” at Melbourne Princess’, confirms a long-
standing suspicion that the secret of pantomime
success lies in coin of the Realm. The manage-
ment buys its “ unprecedented triumph ” with
MISS HILDA SPONG.
(Late of Her Majesty’s Theatre Co.)
cash in advance, and reduces “standing room
only ”to a sordid question of quids. If William-
son and Musgrove order material enough for a
gorgeous annual their customers rush the premises
as a matter of course. An experienced stage-
manager dresses the shop, so to speak, and ulti-
mately the Firm comes along to see that the trade
in seasonable splendour is properly pushed. On
the present occasion the Princess’ is more than
well stocked, and all the goods will soon be dis-
played to advantage. Indeed, Mary Weir was
displayed to the best advantage in a Serpentine
Dance on the opening night, after which she dis-
appeared from the festival at one fell swoop.
Perhaps the vision of skin-tinted tights, whirling
midst fleecy clouds of gauze, was murdered by a
johnniefrom the reserved stalls, whom her outlines
had driven mad. Anyway, Mary was, at time of
writing, as mysteriously missing as Mat. Davies’s
mace. She responded to one tumultuous encore
and vanished. On second thoughts, we fancy that
the angels came and carried her away. Consider-
ing how few items were encored in the early
lights of this entertainment, tt was especially
cruel to purloin Miss Weir. Why didn’t some-
body burgle the everlasting Faust Family, or
remove a duet between Lonnen and Katie Barry
by stealth ? Such articles would not be missed.
# # #
The forty thieves, taken in a gang, are a
prime lot of darlings, adapted by Nature for
sneaking the tender feelings of any good Samari-
tan who might happen to fall amongst ’em.
The Captain, Miss Lelia Roze, is also a nice, quiet
sort of robber, with a lurking sense ot humour
that requires drawing out by Lieutenant Has-
sarac Snazolle. Snazelle himself has wanted
drawing out hitherto. He makes a promising
start by producing a bottle of whisky from his
camel’s hump, but afterwards he is left to wander
like a mitherless bairn in quest of “ bits of fat.”
They seem to have purchased Snazelle for a special
attraction, and put a wet blanket over him. The
rorty artist stands and sighs for chances to be
funny, and pours his melancholy into depressing
ballads. However, the first faults of a pantomime
areeasily corrected. Lonnen, as Ali Baba, activeand
energetic as ever, monopolises most of the inanity,
and Katie Barry is an indefatigable Ganem. Yet
Katie’s talent seldom soars above the indefatig-
able. Rexo and Reno, the contortionists, con-
tribute an act which is wonderful without being
revolting, and Alice Lethbridge simply walks
through the parts where she isn’t dancing. Miss
Lethbridge is an admirable skirt-dancer, but her
line of business is becoming exhausted. Now that
the public appetite for Serpentine has been
whetted, solid drapery, however artistically
managed, is de trap, and a pale pink Alice gleam-
ing through the lime-lighted cobwebs would be
much more acceptable—
E’en as the shine from well-worn pants
Is rubbed aw'ay by turpentine,
So fades the mazy-skirted dance
Before the fleshly Serpentine.
A number of other characters are as nothing com-
pared with Ali Baba’s donkey. In fact, none of
the principals are yet as diverting as the donkey,
who deserves special mention along with Gordon’s
scenery, the ballets, costumes from Hingland, and
other firsLclass fittings.

“ Babes in the Wood,” at the Royal is not
a wildly extravagant affair, as far as money is con-
cerned, but it contains a procession of kings and
queens, from William the Conqueror to V.R.,
which ought to hurry up the coming Republic
considerably. With this melancholy pageant
George Coppin bids fair to annihilate local
“loyalty.” An Anarchist club, sleeping on a
heavy banquet of underdone pork, couldn’t dream
such a slop-made lot of mediaeval monarchs as are
here seen staggering down the stage in couples.
King Stephen administers the death-blow to faith
in Norman blood, and Henry Vee is a distinct
libel on George Rignold. As for the lady on
whose empire the sun never sets, she can only be
regarded as an uncalled-for jest. It were
easy to procure a very stout, very short, and
very rubicund old lady to impersonate our
reigning Sovereign, and when Mr. Coppin orders
the National Anthem to play in honour of a com-
paratively young, tall, slim and pale super, of
amiable appearance, one feels that he must be
poking borak at the blessed Throne. Gourlay,
Geo. Carey, Harry Shine, Poulton and John
Forde appear frequently during the evening,
without awaking too much mirth; also, the dis-
ordered narrative includes a few performing dogs,
and a bevy of appalling infants, who knock
hiil eons din out of drums. Ada Bemister, the
new “ principal boy,” was handicapped in the
first instance by a bad cold, but the recovery of
her voice has made little appreciable difference to
the tout ensemble. Ada is a smart, commanding
kind of lady, who otherwise fails to realise
the expectations raised by Billee Barlow’s en-
gagement of twelve months back. The rival
pantomime is badly in want of a Billee for that
matter. Another serious disappointment is Miss
Bella B isliall’s alleged serpentine dance, which
doesn’t justify its title in either theory or practice,
or excite much enthusiasm. The limelight man is
a weak feature in this item, but, if all the original
effects were available, the fair dancer’s inability
to whirl fast enough would still be felt. Donato,
the one-legged Spaniard who made a spiral stair-
case of iiis wrap in days agone, could have given
many points to the new serpentine generation.
Artist Brunton comes out strong in a clever,
gaudy, transformation scene, and a short harle-
quinade terminates with the tragic death of the
clown (Shine). This is just as it should be. An
infuriated masher, weary of suffering the usual
indignities, fires a pistol at his chief tormentor,
and the painted miscreant rolls dead with a bullet
in his heart as the curtain descends. The corpsed
clown may be a staggerer for the children, but
adults regard him as a step in the right direction.
Next year we may expect the harlequinade to
begin with a similar ghastly murder, and e»4
with the clown’s funeral. /

The musical and firewood festival at the
Exhibition filled a Christmas want, although
there was soon a noticeable waning of public
interest in the chop-and-saw competitions. A
log-chopper on active service is no doubt a moving
spectacle, but life was a deal too short for the
waits between the axe. The present writer hung
around the festival for 30 minutes without seeing
anything save lumps of timber and a few sup-
posed heroes in the act of measuring them, so he
expressed a hope that the best chopper might
ultimately win, and walked sadly away, thinking
of George Washington as he went.

At the Opera House and Alexandra there
are always fine open spaces for the people who
incline towards long suffering heroines, and love
to hoot at the beast that “ shook ” the missing
documents in the prologue. Gloomy dramas of
domestic interest are appealing to the outside
world at both these theatres, but the world rejects
their invitation with a cold, hard stare and whoops
for frivolity. The music halls and many other
places that are open to be explored for a shilling,
or less, seem to drive a good trade, and a really
first-class entertainment at twopence, including
refreshments, would do better still.

Old friend Emily Fitzroy, sitting in the dress-circle of a

people for Mrs. Langtry. The fair Fitzroy was certainly
one of the most fetching actresses who ever showed her
teeth on the Australian stage.
Lnscomhe Searelle, who hasn't grown a hit except in
girth, is in London once more, seeking for talent, writes
T»e Bulletin’s correspondent. The tour of Miss Gene-
vieve Ward and W. H. Vernon in South Africa, under his
auspices, was most successful from every point of view.
So much so, that the engagement was extended to double
the time originally contracted for. Vernon speaks highly
of the appreciative audiences they played to. They played
Shakespeare for 42 nights to £!»00 a w eek. Searelle, the
theatrical boss of South Africa, appears to he a wealthy
man now. He says that what we hear about Boer in-
tolerance is all nonsense. The population is English, and
wants to keep the Transvaal a Republic, and the only
means of doing so is to he nominally governed by the
Boers. The best feeling exists between (he two races
now, except In a few cases amongst the old hands.

Dear Bulletin. Recently,'on several occasions, I at-
tended the rehearsal of a pantomime which is now running
in a certain theatre in an Australian city. The greater
number of the people engaged for the production are
young girls and children some of the latter mere mites —
and to these the stage manager, almost every minute,
made use of the most horrible and disgusting expressions,
This hog’s language was bad enough, but his treatment of
the unhappy youngsters was even worse. He was con-
tinually dragging the poor little wretches about in a
brutal fashion, and on one occasion I saw him, when a
small boy made a false step in a march, knock the young-
ster down and thump him. The lessee of the theatre who
employs this beast has a very good name for gentleness
towards his employes, and it is only right to say that he
was not present on any of the occasions to which I have
referred—in fact, he was absent in another province at the
time. What is stated above is in no w r ay exaggerated,
it is, on the contrary, rather a mild account of the lowest
exhibition of blackguardism I have ever witnessed. —H.B.
Titheradge had occasion to call at the Age office, the
other week, with a view to asking a favour from David
Syme. The great man is not an inveterate theatre-goer,
and he found a difficulty in remembering where and when
he had heard the name of Titheradge. “lam an actor,”
said the comedian, and Syme replied, “Ah-h, ye-ess ” in
a way that seemed to suggest that he had rather thought
his distinguished visitor would turn out to be champion
wrestler or the captin’ of the South Melbourne football-
team. Titheradge may have felt disgusted at the news-
paper proprietor’s indifference to stage celebrity, but the
tonic he received in David’s private office ought to do
him a world of good. Tith., between ourselves, is one of
those highly superior actors who look surprised and in-
terested every time they hoar that there’s a paper called
The Bulletin with pictures in it. “But isn’t that the
same paper as the Argus ? ” he will usually say.

A noticeable fact about the Sydney Lyceum Theatre’s

carefully omitted.

English actresses of the very highest merit and popularity
asked leave to play the piece in the United States. But
the Britisher stood loyal to ids Illinois girl. Well, she
sent me a very small sum from California. She then went
to Australia and played the piece repeatedly; wrote to
me, telling me she only withheld payments because she
was coming to England ; and never came to England, nor
made me any remittance.” Who was she ?

Alice Lethbridge won’t tackle the serpentine dance, for

“ Agatha Tykien, Shipowner,” is Mrs. Langtry’s latest

bodies the actual experience of (he Misses Zander, of
Melbourne, although probably the author never heard of
them.
Harry Leston, the well-known comedian, has given up
what promised to be a brilliant stage career and taken to
teaching elocution. There is a great deal of sea-travelling
in the life of an Australian actor, and Leston can’t even
go down to Manly without suffering such horrors that he
wants to he thrown overboard, so at last he reluctantly
gave the business up—in fact, he had to give it up or
perish. He would probably do well if he went to
England, hut he can’t get there. At one time he had an
idea of risking the voyage from Cooktovvn to Calcutta,
and then doing the rest.of the journey on horseback, hut
after mature consideration he nave it up. It was gener-
ally believed that the spectacle of Leston entering Bagdad
with his smiling countenance and his carpet-hag would he
calculated to arouse the Mahommedan population to
frenzy, and that the consequences might be too serious.
Besides, he would probably be hung as a spy before he got
through Afghanistan. His explanation that he was a
peaceful comedian from Australia would look too thin.

When Sara Bernhardt first visited America she was
interviewed by a hounceahle female reporter. Sara didn’t
speak English in those days, and the she-reporter didn’t
speak French, so an interpreter had to he provided. It
was a bad time for ih > interpreter. The literary female
kept asking questions which he dared not translate lest
Sara saould tear his hair, or set. her menagerie on him,
and the Bernhardt took a dislike tT the invading harridan
from the very beginning, and insisted I hat she slim 11
“get out.” The dialogue was something like this.
R' porter: “Ask her if it is true that she took a death
mask of her husband s face, and afterwards exhibited it
at the Salon?” Interpreter: “She asks, madam, if you
do not find these east winds very trying.” Sara: “Tell
the creature that it is her bonnet that I find tryin-'-
maddening—impossible. Tell her if she floes not leave
the room I shall have to or-r-rush her boniet with a sofa-
cushion.” They both got away alive, though it was a
close call. But to this day the interpreter falls into a
cold perspiration when he thinks of what Sara would
have done to him if he had translated that sho-roportcr
verbatim.
COSTER SONG.

Tell yer at rate, I’m gettin’ thin an’ po're-ly.
Wastin’ to a shadder all along o’ love.

But he's as true as the bloomin’ stars above.

Squeeze her in the evenin’, wen I’d done my round ;

May she never ’nve to suffer bitter pain
Like I try to smother;
O! the miseree-e
Of a bloke deserted, asighin’ all in vain.
I worshipped every feature of the fickle creature—

The Brisbane Worker’s special correspon-
dent, just returned from a trip in a South Sea
slaver, tells how the Kanakas are “ recruited ” :
You may tell a bread-and-butter miss in a Brisbane
church that the Kanaka comes of his own accord. The
man who has been there knows better. They are simply
bought and sold - sold into slavery. Nobody on board a
labour schooner pretends that it is otherwise. How could
they ? The thing- is an obvious, matter of tact transaction
between the Queensland Government and the relatives of
the kidnapped youth. See what happens. The ship
drops anchor ; the recruiting agent pushes off in his boat
with a bundle of “trade” tomahawks, knives, pipes,
tobacco, beads and so forth, tied up in a bright-coloured
scrap of calico; darkies begin to crowd the beach ; the
officer holds the bundle up to their admiring gaze ; every-
body knows that it represents the price of a boy ;
presently out step a couple of old men with a youngster
marching between them ; the first sacrifice is made ; the
boy tumbles into the boat and his elderly friends march
off in triumph with the gewgaws. Perhaps when he gets
on board he will fail to make himself understood.
We took one boy back to Queensland with us who was
absolutely dumb the whole of the voyage. No one could
speak his language. A batch of seven others spoke in a
tongue that no one on board understood. Any appeal
under such circumstances would have been utterly use-
less. One after another the boys come down to the beach
in charge of their “friends,” the bundles of trade are
handed over, and the silent bargains are struck. If the
boy now dead for a while eats none of the funeral meats
he is equally out of it when the time comes for his return
to life. The boys we landed were always plundered. If
they were bushmen the salt-water tribes who held the
beaches pounced down upon them before their own
people had a chance of making good their claim ; if they
happened to belong to the tribe in possession of the beach
then they had the privilege of being robbed by their
friends. In either case the result of their three years’
thrift was appropriated, and the very clothes they wore
scattered broadcast among the community. That, no
doubt, is the secret of the traffic. Just as in “ civilised”
countries, out of regard for their own comfort the rich
send the poor into hades, so in the South Sea Islands the
strong and lazy ship the •young and active across to
Queensland.
The Greatest of Australia’s
Dead.
There stands on the shelves of the cataloguing
room of Melbourne Public Library a range o
well-bound folio volumes entitled “The Parlia
mentary History of Victoria.” They represen
an idea of Sir Redmond Barry’s. Take down i
volume to the right hand and open it, and yoi
will find it a compilation of blank pages. Taki
down a volume to the left, and you shall discen
the profile, as it were, of the distinguished jurist’]
plan. A short, squat page of Hansard confront:
you, inserted between two magnificent folit
sheets. “On those sheets,” said Sir Redmond
“I would have mounted a commentary on th<
debates. It should be composed of extracts fron
the public press, documents of State, the letters
of public men, their portraits, their tailors’ anc
their washing bills even, and such like flotsam ol
the hour. A hundred years hence some historian,
because we have done this, shall of his doits pay
for a perpetual mass for our souls’ salvation ! ’
Then, pausing, he drew a finger-tip across the
bands of half-a-dozen volumes, and, proceeding
(a suggestive note of reverie in his tones), said :
“Particularly should everything bearing upon
Mr. Higinbotharn’s career be collected. The his-
torian will want to know what sort of a man he
was that challenged the Constitution and—and
the Empire. Those six volumes should be Mr.
Higinbotham’s! ” " With the touch of epigram
with which he frequently adorned his obiter dicta
the Judge added : “And the historian would find
the bills paid !”
# # #
That range of great volumes stands to-day but
the simulacrum of a history. The petty hirelings
of the State have no sympathy with ingenuous
enthusiasm such as the Judge and Scholar was not
ashamed* to own, and they have left the book as it
was when Sir Redmond deposited it in their
charge, ft is the veriest shell. But what would
Australia not give at this moment for “ those six
volumes” that the framer of the plan, the creator
of the noble Library which by that plan he would
have endowed with a priceless treasure, had thus
conceived? To gain them, replete with the sym-
bols of the time; eloquent of its passions, its
enmities, and its aspirations ; and significant—in
their reports, their caricatures, their satires, their
ana, their mots, their imprecations—of the agony
of national travail, Australia would sacrifice every
other page of locally-recorded speech she possesses.
For those six volumes would have told the mighty
dramatic story of the birth epoch of Australian
democracy, and would have shown as nothing
now extant can show the virile proportions of the
protagonist of the drama—George Higinbotharn,
* « #
There was no objective point of democratic
sympathy and aspiration that was not, from 1863
to 1870, assailed in Victoria by the forces of privi-
lege and plutocracy. Manhood suffrage, the
popular power of the purse, absolute and not
merely nominal self-government, the right of an
Australian community to conserve industrial
interests without reference to unstable economic
theory or to the mercantili.-m of a foreign state,
the abolition of electoral and representative privi-
lege, and national education, were all unsettled
questions then. Through the storm and stress of
the period they passed from the region of doubt
into the category of solved problems, and though
symptoms of reaction may have since been occa-
sionally manifested with respect to some of these
vital democratic issues, the set of the cur-
rents of national existence was, within those
years, finally determined, and the highest
tidemark defined. The battle of Constitu-
tionalism against an oligarchic officialdom had
been fought in New South Wales ; the conflict of
which it was the precursor and which was still
more tremendous in its intensity and in its scope
because it attached an indelible character to the
democratic institutions of Australia, was naturally
fought in the younger province. Wentworth was
the animating soul of the one; Higinbotham, a
greater Wentworth—the phrase is measured and
advised—that of the other.
• • #
We_ do not depreciate Wentworth when we
magnify the man who, with a stern simplicity
that fills the imagination with a grander solemnity
than the pomp and circumstance of state obsequies,
was last Monday returned to his mother earth.
the First of First-born Australians ” did
a great work when, for the welfare of
unborn generations it had to be done,
at the risk of the doer’s loss and at the
cost of obloquy. He had intellectual force and
the pervading fire of genius that constitutes the
orator, the statesman, and the patriot. But a
perfect magnanimity of soul he had not, for he
did not scorn to take advantage for his own benefit
of the degraded temper of his day, and he could
not rise above his own ambitions. The monstrous
Maori land land-grab, and his refusal to trust the
people absolutely because the people at last had
come to mistrust him somewhat, are stains upon
Wentworth’s greatness. Had N.S.W. possessed
a powerful and brilliant press, and the community
been one of freemen, it is conceivable that after
the Maoriland fiasco Wentworth’s influence had
been utterly demolished, and that to other men
would have fallen the glorious task of winning our
constitutional freedom. A sound press would
have declared that he had bartered his chance
of immortality for an ephemeral greed. Turn
upon Higinbotham the flashlight of similar
criticism, and the unchallengeable purity of his
public and his private life is your answer.
* » *
No biographer shall have to make apology for
Higinbotham. He took nothing from the public
to which be had not an absolute right; he took
less than he had a right to ; he took immeasurably
less than he gave. The intellectual force and the
pervading fire of genius were his, too ; but to them
he added an undimmed honour, a humility of
personal aim, a singleness of eye, a patience with
the people even when the people’s madness stung
him, and a dauntless sincerity and strength.
Wentworth, when he chose to be unscrupulous,
was supported by the abler section of an insipid
press, and had to contend only with its weaker
element, while outside the press his adversary was
an inert mass of officialdom entrenched behind
the traditions descended from a remote age.
Higinbotham, in his contest with Conser-
vatism, found it as aggressive as it was
able ; found, moreover, that it had en-
hated as allies the most brilliant band of
journalists and publicists ever controlled by a
daily journal in these provinces. It was a current
saying that, while of the M'Culloch-Higinbotham
Ministry but Higinbotham and Michie could
a a 'k' l *et as intellectually strong as the
Ministry far and away the ablest that ever took
office in Australia—could have been formed from
the Argus staff. These men of the pen gained
for the local contest the invaluable aid of the
British periodical and newspaper press. A letter
or two, and a solitary article apologetically in-
serted, made up the total published contributions
on the Liberal side, though the Conservative views
inundated every important magazine and journal.
One M estminster Review article, a superb piece
?< f 7 ri * ingr ’ denounced Higinbotham for
felonious and criminal” conduct, was the
joint work of two Argus men, and a man
who afterwards became a puisne Judge;
the reply to it was refused insertion. The
octopus of British mercantilism, fearful of
the threatened loss of most profitable markets,
threw out its tentacles and sucked almost
to the point of exhaustion the financial and com-
mercial energies of Melbourne; on the other hand,
the potential force embodied in the .sentimental
attachment for England of the Britons who
formed the bulk of the Victorian population, was
stimulated to an unreasoning excitement by their
‘ home ” correspondents. Men to whom England
had granted only penury and the croud privilege
of being someone’s serf, but on whom Victoria
had conferred manhood and independence, were
stirred on a sudden to war for their ancient chains
and to*peroeive glories in their former yoke. Down-
mg-street, and even the Throne, were included in
tlie forces of the Conservatives, The former
interfered with internal administration toa degree
it has never dared to do since, and the
visit of the Duke of Edinburgh was, beyond
doubt, but a card played from the Con-
servative hand. Against this tremendous
array of the Reactionaries, McCulloch led but half-
heartedly. Higinbotham, the lieutenant, was
really the general. With unfailing resource and
tact, and with never-flagging vigour and dan he
marshalled at once his company in Parliament and
his cohorts of tlm people. At once he was
The Porum’s champion ami the People’s chief.
* # #
He met ins adversaries at all points, whether
they sheltered themselves behind the practice of
the Constitution or behind considerations of expe-
diency. There has been no leader like him in
Australian politics none with the dash and
daring, the courage and rectitude, the culture and
resource. He broke the forces of Uowning-street,
and he took the heart out of the most arrogant and
exclusive Chamber Australia has ever known. He
won from privilege and class ground they have
never since been able to recover—ground they
never shall recover while Higinbotham’s name
retains its magic of conjuration.
* # #
That was Higinbotham s political achievement,
and for it he had his reward in the fervent trust
and affection of the people, and the enmity of a
petty local cabal which superseded him by the un-
speakable Bent. When he re-entered Parliament
it was seen he was not the same man. It was not
AT il r. i iac * s * into Conservatism as
McCulloch, and Verdon, and Francis, and Service
did ; not so, for to the day he, died his heart swung
true to the poles of Democracy. In the storm and
exhilaration of the combat it was not understood
how the fiery spirit was burning up the fibre of
the physical clay. But when he reappeared in the
House how he had suffered was made apparent.
Of the brightness and strength of his intellect
there was no diminution, nor were the passion and
fire, the grace and point, of his oratory modified.
But he spoke seldom, and, as a constructive
statesman, manifested himself still less frequently.
He sought to carry proposals for land-reform,
which would have made Victoria the most ad-
vanced and contented country in the world, but he
was defeated, chiefly by the aid of men who are
novv waiting the paralysing touch of the law upon
their shonldersforparticipationin land-boom frauds
that would have been rendered impossible by his
scheme of legislation. And he advocated “as of
far-reaching moral value” the abolition of the
distinction between law and equity. These were
almost his only notable attempts to democratise
Victorian institutions in his later parliamen-
tary life, and they were impotent of practical
result. Nevertheless, they proved of inestimable
worth, for they showed the soul of the man was
inalienably the people’s. He was no “lost leader,"
though, by physical weakness, already foredoomed
to the splendid exile of the Heneh.
As a J «dge. he was of classic proportions. To
most great lawyers, the elevation to judicial rank
l8 > 80 as the public are concerned, a foretaste
of oblivion. But by two special acts—one of sua-
tajned endeavour through long years, and the
2j( ie . r spontaneous and momentary George
Higinbotham deepened to the degree of im-
Perishability the clear-cut outlines with which his
P° rt rait had been graven upon the hearts of the

Parkes, as might
have been anticipated,

body now living under-
stands to the full how
viciously ungrateful to
Darvall that action was,
for the main cause why
Parkes should have
esteemed Darvall above
all men is unknown to
present - day folk. On
Parkes’ return from
England from his abor-
tive emigration lecturing-
tour, Darvall urged him
not to re-enter politics at
once, but to increase and
systematise his culture
by formal study for a
profession. “With your
abilities,” said Darvall,
“four or five years’ read-
ing would qualify you
for medicine or the Bar.
You would then have a
means of independent
income. If you decide
for the law, you can
read in ray chambers and
have the use of my
library.” The offer was
as nobly generous as the
suggestion was valuable.
Parkes accepted both,
and read for three or four
weeks ! Then, finding
study more irksome
than gas-bagging, he
attempted to re-enttr
politics. How? By
opposing Darvall at East
Maitland !

Parkes’ new house at Annandale (Sydney),
according to a correspondent, was vacant for two
years before he took it by reason of an alleged

terrified look at the new tenant, and then gathered
up its spectral carpet-bag and fled from the scene.
Not a line appears in Parkes’ book about
the Centenary festivities ! The immortal State
House is not mentioned !! Nor the attempt to filch
the name of Australia!!! Yet the Times says
“ the author has the courage of his opinions ! !!!”
The book is damned by its omissions. The

Neither of the Sydney morning papers, in

none who was then present, not even the vegetable-

in exquisitely modulated tones, he claimed that

man was never more finely shown, though habitu-
ally illustrated.
In his book, remarks a correspondent,
Parkes traces his career in Australia, commencing
with his employment as a farm-labourer, hue never
a word does lie say of the bad tops be used to make
in Sydney, and which brought down upon Ins
head the anathemas of every boy whose “ Parkes’
top ” was split by a “Tom Morriser.” Tom was
noted for the superiority of his manufacture. He
had a shop in Campbell street, where all Cape’s
and the Normal Institution boys used to buy their
“ spinners.”
The Bishop of North Queensland, lately
travelling by coach from the coast to a goldfield,
stayed for the night at a well-known bush hostelry
kept by a co-religionist of bis, who, never having
had the honour of receiving a bishop under her
roof-tree before, was untiring in her efforts to
please. She hovered round his lordship’s chair
during his meal, lifted flies out of his tea with her
finger, presented him with a raw onion from her
pocket as a delicacy, and paid him many other
charming little attentions.
The last list of new Js.P. up South con-
tained the name of an experienced, long-headed
citizen of under 30 years of age, who, three weeks
after his marriage with a certain politician’s
daughter, deserted her. He went on a wild,
drunken orgy to Maoriland, where he exhausted
both his funds and his vitality. He was forwarded
home from the hospital in which he ended his
holiday, upon a guarantee from his friends (they
were afraid to trust him with money) that his
fare would be paid on his arrival in Sydney.
The Argus professes to scoff at the “singu-
lar suggestion that Sir Henry Parkes would be
raised to the peerage but for the unfortunate fact
that he is not ‘overwhelmingly rich.' ” It happens
that the reference to Sir 'Enery's impecuniosity
as a disqualification for a coronet is the one feature
of the suggestion which is not singular. Compared
with an ordinary brainless, apotheosised brewer,
the old man from Brummagem would make a most
estimable peer, and the fact that he doesn’t run a
brewery is the only earthly reason why he ought
not to bo created a marquis to-morrow.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Victorian public debt on 30tb June
was £16,711.287.
Speaker Jenkin Coles, of S.A. Assembly,
expects knighthood before next Parliament meets,
Le Caron, it is said, starts a weekly politi-
cal journal in London. To be called the Spy, no
doubt.
Another member of the N.S.W. Legisla-
tive Council is in financial difficulties, and his
schedule is expected to be filed any day.
“The business of a Radical representative
n Parliament is to keep the Ministry up to the
Radical high-water mark ” (Labouchere).
The London Tory journal, Imperial
Federation, alluding to Dibbs’ enhandlement,
contemptuously speaks of him as “ the Dibbs of
other days.”
According to the Brisbane (Q.) Courier,
MTlwraith has left his resignation “in the hands
of a trusty friend, for use in the event of any un-
seen emergency.”
Thirteen is a proverbially unlucky num-
ber. The only law of first importance passed by
the thirteenth Parliament of S.A. was the enact-
ment of free education. .
Melbourne papers pathetically reiterate
hints of Mr. Shiels’ weariness of office and growing
disgust of place and pay. Shiels has bitten off
more than he can chew.
English papers say that an independent
Labour Party will never be formed in the British
Parliament, because each of its units fancies him-
self a “ heaven-born leader.”
Dr. Pearson has been appointed secretary
to the Victorian Agent-General, because Premier
Shiels pledged his political honour that the Pro-
fessor would not be so appointed.
The Australasian monopolistic press should
desist from running down Jay Gould. He was
only the true, logical expression of the grab-all,
individualistic system they so much admire.
MTlwraith to Hodgkinson : “ Can’t you
read this notice? ‘Croydon to Granite Creek
Land-grab Swindlecate : Trespassers on private
preserves will be evicted from the Cabinet. ’ Go !
Get !! ”
When Premier Downer (S.A.) announced
that he intended to “send ’ome ” for a new com-
mander somebody very pertinently asked if this
wasn’t Downer’s home? The question wasn’t
answered.
The slave-dhow Empreza has returned to
Queensland with 119 “ recruited ” black labourers,
of whom two only are Marys (females). The
proportion between the sexes is thus beautifully
preserved.
S.A. National Ass has nothing to say about
a “vote for Thrift.” Such a cry would be
dangerous in a province where even Conservatives
approve of One-man-one-vote, because they can’t
abolish it.
Griffith to Nelson : “ Scratch poor cocky
with an extra £lOOO per annum as Chief Justice.”
Nelson to Griffith : “ Scratch poor cocky with the
Chief Secretaryship.” A round game of “scratch
poor cocky.”
Shaw Maxwell appears to be jealous of
John Burns, and says that “ his egregious vanity
is the despair of all associated with him.” Fana-
ticism or vanity is a necessity for those who
pioneer reforms.
American monopolists are uniting to down
manhood suffrage. The mere attempt will awaken
the dormant American workers to a knowledge of
unused political rights and the neglected duties
dependent on them.
“How are we regarded at Home?’’ the
Standard asked Munro when he reached Mel-
bourne. “Asa band of thieves ! ” replied Jimmy.
This is very sad, but we cannot complain if we
are judged by certain of ourown “representative”
men.
The Protectionists should see that the
Age dialogue, “Freetrade Fallacies and Protec-
tion Proofs ” is reprinted and distributed in scores
of thousands throughout Australasia. It is the
most effective thing of the sort we have seen for
years.
E. G. Brown, who was absent from the
division on the late Dibbs censure motion, is a
brother of H. H. Brown who, though a nominal
Freetrader, voted for the Protectionist Govern-
ment. Those who know the Brothers Brown are
busy making deductions.
Premier-Knight Downer means to bring
an English officer to rule the S.A. militia,
‘because a local appointment would breed
jealousy and dissatisfaction.” Similarly, England
ought to take a “colonial” cut-throat to fill the
post of the Shook of Gampridge.
The Alpha of Dr. Pearson’s political career
was a jobbery douceur of £lOOO for a report (ever
since carefully pigeon-holed) on the Victorian
State-school system; the Omega will probably be
ms appointment to the Victorian Agency-General,
of which he is already the secretary.
Melbourne Argus says that the Queens-
land planter ‘.‘must be content to treat the
Kanaka as a free-labourer.” This is obviously a
Misprint. What the Argus meant to say was
that the Queensland planter is quite content to
treat the free-labourer as a Kanaka.
Nelson will probably bo the next Premier
of Queensland, it being freely stated that Griffith
will positively resign in February, and will advise
Norman to send for Nelson. How long the
Manila man will be chief oook of Kanakaland de-
Ponds on the result of the next elections.
Women canvassed hard against the two
arch-opponents of women-franchise in the Maori-
land Parliament—Fish and Fisher—when they
ran for the Mayoralties of Dunedin and Welling-
ton respectively. The pair had often won before
but they were beaten on the women’s votes.
When we consider that during the Balfou 1 ’
regime, so-called dynamite outrages didn’t ocean
though legitimate Irish agitation is ever most
active in periods of coercion, the presumption is
pretty strong that the late attempt on Dublin
Castle had its origin in a conspiracy of land-
lordism.
The Melbourne metropolitan district,
remarks the Age, returns 32 members to the Vic-
torian Legislative Assembly, yet spite of “ the
parting of the ways,” there is absolutely no Free-
trade party in the House. There are Freetraders,
but they preserve their seats by conducting them-
selves as Protectionists.
In an article on Australasian Federation,
which appeared in St. James’ Budget (London),
Hon. Edmund Barton is called the Victorian
Attorney-General, and is credited with having
brought forward a motion in “ the Victorian
House of Commons” in favour of Federation,
Let us federate —in the interests of geography.
When Cotton went home ill from the S. A-
Legislative Council one of the less virulent land-
grabbers agreed to pair with him. He was dead,
having passed away quietly in his sleep, when the
motion in favour of a Trades Hall Site came up
for settlement, but his pair was counted in respect
to the division. So he voted in death as in life.
The S.A. general elections take place in
April, and it is stated that Downer means to
ignore the Assembly resolution that all nomina-
tions should be simultaneous. The Council threw
out the bill limiting election-expenses to £lOO per
candidate and inflicting specially heavy penalties
for bribery. This legislation does not suit the
National Ass.
“ You Freetraders are not consistent for a
moment. At the very time the Freetrade mob
were shouting their hosannahs to President
Cleveland, the United States Congress was pass-
ing a law to restrict immigration. It would have
its goods imported free, but it would keep out the
people who made them. And this is a sign of a
Freetrade reaction ! —lhe Age.
Unmack is anxious to have a Queensland
Coalition Government to maintain law and order
against Anarchy. There is a lot of policy in
giving a dog a bad name. Why don’t the fight-
ing democrats of Australia stick the obnoxious
term where it fits? The “sehindycator,” slave-
traders, leper-breeders, and inflated grabbers, are
the only anarchists in the land.
There is so much dissatisfaction in Maori"
land with the imperfect character of last session’s
Shop Hours’ Act, that next session there will be a
demand even from employers that a day be fixed
for the weekly half-holiday, and that it be made
compulsory to close on that day. At present, a
man can close or not, as he likes, provided he lets
his assistants away on one afternoon a week.
It is alleged that a shindykit consisting
principally of Patterson, Harper, and O’Loghlen
—two howling bigots and an irresponsible gossoon
—will presently make a great effort to upset the
Shiels Cabinet and form a new Victorian Ministry.
O’Loghlen is to be Treasurer and borrow
£9,000,000 every year at 10 per cent., and Patter-
son and Harper are to suppress the trades-unions
and fire low.
Premier Shiels (Vic.) has one formula for
all awkward questions : “ It would not be in the
public interest to give the desired information.”
This short sentence has eaten into his system so
badly that if a member got up and asked him if it
was true that he had hidden a murdered infant up
a drain, he would probably arise, with a lack-
lustre expression in his eye, and grind out his old
remark quite unconsciously.
New South Wales Judges get £2BOO a year
and enormous travelling expenses, and when
they’re too old and silly to draw full salary they
retire on a pension of £lBOO, or so, yearly, though
their salary has been so high that they might
easily have lived on their savings. But a man,
disabled for life while working on the railway-
line, gets a lump sum of £25, and then is told that
he has no farther claim on the State.
Maoriland Govt, has, in exercise of its
statutory powers, just taken over the late “ Ready
Money Robinson’s ” Cheviot Hills (Canterbury)
Estate because the trustees would not agree to
pay land-tax on an official valuation of £304,826,
and insisted that it was only worth £260,220—at
which price Govt, snapped it up. There are
84,222 acres in the run, which is to be cut up.
This is the first case of the kind in Maoriland.
“ Whatever the planter might desire,”
remarks the Argus, loftily, “lie must be content
to treat the Polynesian as a free labourer.” Apart
from its blessed ingenuousness, this sentence is
valuable as affording a clear definition of the
“ free-labourer. ” The white “ free-labourer ” is
invited to extend his hand to the cheap nigger,
and call him brother. To what base uses do they
return who play into the hands of the monopolist!
Samuel Griffith arrived in Townsville in
the course of his N.Q. trip, just in time to find
his effigy hanging by the neck from a tree as
an expression of public enthusiasm. Two or
three big capitalists gave him a cordial welcome
and liquored him up at a hotel, but the bulk of
the population preserved an ominous silence. The
strangled image that danced at the end of the
rope expressed their sentiments more eloquently
than words.
In 1838, Harriet Martineau wrote to
Edward Smith Hall, of Sydney, that she would
visit Australia, “if health lasted.” From her
heart’s core” she craved “it might become an
ideal country.” If ihe Shades as they stroll in
the fields of Asphodel can curse, how noble
dreamers must imprecate the iniquitous brood of
politicians that have brought Australia to their
own slimy level ! This land was the idealists’
Utopia ! It is our politicians’ dung-heap.
That solid old Tory, G. W. Rusden, wails
bitterly in the dreary columns of Greater
Britain about the appointment of twelve demo-
crats to the Maoriland Upper House, and asks :
Would Englishmen understand the vilencss cf ihe wrong
done to New Zealand if they should see an attempt to
foist about 200 peers upon the House of Lords in order to
carry a Bill to set Ireland in flames?
Where are the “flames,” anyhow? Has Rusden
got them in his pocket, or what?
Of the 32 men really returned on the
labour ticket to N.S.W. Legislative Assembly 15
are Freetraders and 17 Protectionists. As for
nationality, 8 are Australians, of whom 5 are Pro-
tectionists ; 7 are Scotch, 5 of whom are Free-
traders ; 16 are English, of whom 12 are Protec-
tionists ; 3 are Irish, 2 of whom are Protectionists,
while the American and Maorilander who make
up the total are both Freetraders. The N.S.W.
Assembly (141 members) does not contain quite 50
natives.
When the Maoriland land-tax was imposed
last session, the croakers said it would never bring
in the required revenue. Tax - Commissioner
Crombie (an old Victorian pressman) said it
would, and estimated the receipts at ,£286,000.
That was six months ago. In the result, £284,000
came up to the days of grace, and another £2OOO
by post later. Good guessing, this. The Maori-
land income-tax was not payable until the end of
December, and that Crombie estimates at £92,000.
The Maoriland Ministry are jubilant.
“ Freedom of contract ” was once a phrase
that represented a human aspiration for liberty,
but that was in the days when feudality and serf-
dom made men and women an appendage of acres,
mere things that went with the land like the trees
and the stone quarries. Now, the conditions that
make this appeal for freedom having been merged
into environments only less odious, the shibboleth,
sanctified by the traditions and associations of by-
gone victories, is hypocritically used, ostensibly on
the side of liberty, but in reality as a cry to catch
the thoughtless and crush the wage-slaves “ rightly
struggling to be free.” The phrase is the same,
but the aspiration that animates it is very differ-
ent. It is the spirit of slavery masquerading in
garments cast off by resistance to tyranny and
oppression.
When Nelson becomes Kanakaland’s Pre-
mier, good dog Towzer and “Post and Rails”
Unmack will probably get “left.” Hodgkinson
will be nonest, and “Lands” Cowley will be dis-
pensed with. Both are Northern men, while
Towzer’s kennel is in the Wide Bay district.
Probable colleagues of Nelson are—MTlwraith,
Morehead, Barlow, Dickson, Morgan, and
Byrnes. A S.Q. team, and another mixing up of
autipathetics. Morehead and Dickson have in the
past been violent incompatibles, while windbag
Barlow enjoys the scorn of older parliamentarians.
The deadly feud between MTlwraith and More-
head—virulent, though of recent date —is to be
scummed over with the gold-beater’s skin of oof.
And fancy MTlwraith second-fiddle to Nelson,
whose parliamentary experience dates only from
within the last decade ! If the elections result in
the return of the new hotch-potch it will be lucky
if it lasts through one session.
Dear Bulletin, —Some instructive figures.
Salaries of the Supreme Court of N.S. Wales, any
of the judgments of which may, on appeal, be
reversed by a foreign tribunal, 16,000 miles distant
—Chief Justice, £3500 ; Associate-Judges, £2BOO.
Salaries of the Supreme Court of the United
States, admitted, even by unfriendly critics, to
be the highest and most impartial judicial body
in existence, and from whose decisions there is no
appeal—Chief Justice (an office filled in the past
by such historical figures as John Jay, Marshall,
Ellsworth and Chase), £2lOO ; Associate-Judges,
£2OOO. Salary of that automaton, the Governor
of the province of Victoria, £lO,OOO. Cleveland’s
pay when Governor of the great State of New
York, with a population of six-and-a-half millions,
£2OOO. Total pay of the forty-seven elected work-
ing governors of the states and territories com-
prising the Union, £34,260, considerably less than
the sum paid to the seven appointed nonentities
who nominally boss these “ kawlinies.”— Kanuck.
At last we are getting sanity in Free-
traders’ discussions of economic issues. Professor
Devas, of Ireland, one of the most lucid and wide-
minded economists of the day, thus writes :
It may reasonably be asked why, if the matter of Free-
trade and Protection is so simple, it has aroused such
lengthy and embittered criticism and controversy, not
merely among traders whose strong personal interests
will account for any mistakes in their reasonings, but also
among calm and impartial economists. The answer is
perhaps as follows. The classical economists were imper-
fectly aware of the principle of increasing returns, of the
principle of misdirected consumption, and of the anta-
gonism of national interests; they teere dazzled by the
example of England, the great cent re of wealth and trade,
the economic model of all eyes for some three quarters of
the nineteenth century, and a country precisely at that
time sin ndarly adapted for Freetrade ; and they tacitly
applied the condition of England to all other countries.
No wonder then, assuming what they assumed, and
ignoring what they ignored, that every Protectionist
appeared to them very like a fool or a knave. After
which it was difficult for Hie Protectionists to he very
calm in their answer or very clear. Remember besides
that, as the practical application of Freetrade or Protec-
tion turns on particular matters of fact, which are often
disputable, there is plenty of room for dispute.
Italics are The Bulletin's. It is about time
somebody emphasized the circumstance that a
Freetradt r can pen a common-sense statement.

THE CROWN CONSIDERING.
PREMIER SHIELS : “Any amount of consideration is expected from us in this matter.”
BERRY : “Quite right, William—keep on considering.”
What does Hhiels consider?
Does lie show his teeth and smile
At the narrative so neat
Of the merry Mercantile
And its final balance sheet —
Does he ask himself why was it
That a dividend they paid
From the moneys on deposit
When no profit had been made ?
Does the Premier consider
That Sir Matthew was a “kiddor”
Of the orphan and the widder
With whose capital he played ?
Now, what is Shiels thinking ?
Can the figures and the facts
He is slowly wading through
Satisfy him that the acts
Of the influential crew
Were superlatively honest,
And particularly square ;
Would he rather he were non cst
In this troublesome affair ?
Now, what is Shiels thinking ?
Is his heart within him sinking,
Or his other optic winking
At the one-time “ millionaire ? ”
What is Willie’s notion ?
Is the prima-facie case
Hot and strong enough for him ?
Does be wear upon his face
An expression stern and grim ?
Does he cry, “ The country bust is
(Though he don’t approve of slang),
But it shan’t be said that Justice
Has exploded with the gang ? ”
Does he tremble with emotion
Born of patriot’s devotion?
Can Willie raise a notion—
And does he care a hang ?

The pious wife of a Melbourne Judge sent
a Christmas card, with a few godly sentiments of

The applicants for almost every vacant

He was a new arrival, and knew as much
of the geography or size of Australia as newchum
Englishmen generally do. He had an uncle living
“ somewhere in Sydney,” and wished to find him.
Someone advised him to try the populous suburb
of Rookwood, where it was the fashion for most
of the residents to have their names engraved on
their residences. After wandering about there
half the day, and seeing nothing but tombstones,
the idea that he was the victim of a practical joke
began to painfully intrude itself into his thinking-
pan ; consequently, there is at least one newchum
in Sydney who has not a very exalted opinion of
the beastly colonials.

A certain Australian evening paper now

The old-time convict-regulations are still
tenaciously adhered to in Hobart. When a
drunken man is taken care of at the lock up (the
old prisoners’detention house) one of the questions
put to him regards his “ condition.” By this it
is not meant his bodily condition, but his status
in society—whether he be “B” (Bond), “F.C.”
(Free to the Colony) or “F.S.” (Free by Servi-
tude). Occasionally a man is unable to answer,
and he is duly logged as “F.C.,” and remains as
such for ever and ever. The scale of rates and
charges, imposed by the police and Bench, runs
something like this : Drunk, 55., or seven days ;
disturbing the peace, about ditto; gouging a
policeman’s eye out, 20s. or a month ; stealing a
bottle of lemonade, value 2d., three months; per-
forming an illegal operation, adjourned sine die ;
objurgating the present condition of affairs gene-
rally in a public place within the hearing of
persons, &0., six months hard labour.

Dear Bulletin, —I propose to start an
inebriate asylum on tho only true method, all
other methods being bogus and brass, and
originated by plausible impostors. It is entirely
my own discovery. I am arranging to obtain from
the Government a grant of 400 acres of rich and
heavily-timbered land on which to build a sana-
torium ; considering that the institution will be a
public benefit, there should be no difficulty on
this score. When the house is built—l have
arranged to get the money advanced on mortgage
—I will proceed to take in inebriates at the
extremely low rate of two guineas per week. The
system at first will consist chiefly of wood-
chopping. and I reckon that thirty inebriates will
be sufficient to clear and fence the land. After
that I propose to treat serious cases with plough-
ing, digging, planting potatoes, carting manure,
and similar remedies. lam firmly convinced that
vigorous exercise is the only cure for dipsomania.
My brother, who has a station on the Darling,
proposes to run it entirely with inebriates this
year, rates .£7O per year paid in advance. Any
patient who fails to observe the prescribed regi-
men—which will consist chiefly of shearing and
branding—may be promptly dismissed from the
sanatorium. —Yours, &c., L.

A case of curious interest to some prominent
Australians who, 15 years ago, entertained as
good “society” people, Mr. and Mrs. Morton
Tavares, was down for hearing early in October
at the Court of Queen's Bench, London. In those
days, “Mrs.” Tavares was an endurable actress
and a charming and very popular lady, while
“ Morty,” her tragedian-siiouse, was physically ft
dashing old boy, upright as Marshal Soult, with
dark eyes flashing with the glint of youthful fire.
Now, alas ! Morton Tavares appears in the pre-
cincts of the court a wreck ; feeble, blind, bent
double, his once black hair and moustache now
white, flawing and straggling—the living embodi-
ment of a “crushed tragedian to prosecute
Madame (now Mrs. Wise, the wife of the
captain of an ocean steamer) for alleged
slander, in that she declared she had married
Tavares, believing him to be a single man, where-
as he wickedly wasn’t, but already had a wife. It
was while “Mr. and Mrs. Morton Tavares” were
voyaging from Australia to the East in Captain
Wise’s ship that Mrs. T., otherwise Miss Surtees,
made the discovery that she was number two wife,
or whatever it may be called, whereupon she
promptly left the much-married tragedian—
Which when the cap’ll came to hear it he werry much
applauded what she'd d me, and immediately made her
his fust leftenant of the good ship, etcetera.
Now the grim old plaintiff declares that ho did
not marry Miss Surtees at all, and that she knew
it. “I may,” says he, “have been guilty of an
immoral act in living with her, but guilty of a
Chime NEVER-R-K. She lias accused me of
the terrible crime of bigamy, against which my
soul revolts. Therefore will 1 pursue her to the
gr-r-rave.” But lie didn't. At the last moment,
he withdrew the case on payment of his costa,
which Mr. Tom Rome cheerfully liquidated, to
avert annoyance to his wife who had been forced
reluctantly into the position of principal witness.

Last Christmas Day but one,
And never his looks or his lips disclose
Regret for the deed he’s done.
His step falls light, his smile is bright,
He merrily cuts his joke ;
Yes, Jim’s as right as rain, in spite
Of the Missis’s nose that’s “ broke.”
For the real proof of a damaged “ tart ”
Lies in the eating, sure ;
And Jim finds joy in his Sarah’s heart,
And jam ”in her love so pure.
A handsome face about the place
Can’t banish a husband’s woes ;
But here’s a case of angel grace
Combined with a broken nose.
So, whensoe’er you may chance to meet
Upon the arm of Jim
A dowdy girl who don’t seem sweet,
Raise hats to her and him.
Some beauty may be here to-day,
To-morrow the blossom blows;
But fair for aye, and good alway,
Is the wife with a broken nose.

But I turn my face from the noonday light,
For I am only a dreamer still.

The sons of toil have toiled their fill,
But I have wasted the s immer day,
For I am only a dreamer still.

The sky is red where the sun hrs set,
But I in my hammock idly swing,
For I am only a dreamer yet.

The day is lost and the night is here,
And I am only a dreamer still.

How is this for front? A certain civil
servant in a second-rate Australian city some time
ago called a meeting of all the other civil servants
m his town “ to consider a matter of the utmost
importance.” There was a large attendance. The
originator of the movement took the chair, and,
after giving way to a little brief emotion, he
arose, and, in a broken voice, addressed the
audience. The case, he said, was a very painful
one. there was a gentleman amongst them —a
gentleman known to them all, universally liked
and respected, perhaps the most popular man in
the room, and the bearer of a spotless reputation,
who had unfortunately given way to temptation.
He was short in his cash. It was impossible to
•mention the delinquent’s name, but he had
confessed all to him (the speaker) and implored his
assistance. (General emotion.) The only thing
to bs done was to take up a subscription, and the
orator solemnly laid £5 on the table as his own
contribution. Then the hat went round; every
chappie made a great effort, and £95 was realised.
The chairman took the money and thanked them
on behalf of the erring brother, and thev went
away, every man wondering whose cash was short,
and everybody suspecting his own particular boss
as the culprit probably it was because each man
suspected his own immediate boss that the con-
tributions were so abundant. That was two years
ago, and the secret just leaked out the other day.
The man whose cash was deficient was the eloquent
chairman himself. He was £3B short, and the
subscription, not counting his own £3, left him
£32 to the good.

Reinachism.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Whether Baron Reinach, one of the
Parisian Panama Canal Co. directors, really died
of heart-disease, or apoplexy, or poison, or only
planted some stones in a gaudy sepulchre, I do
not propose to discuss. It is only worth remem-
bering that political crises and the delays in
forming fresh French Governments, permitted
enough time for a thoroughly scared live Reinach
—if alive, only—to find a corpse and decently bury
him in disguised clothing.
The time is, anyhow, evidently gone by when
men can successfully suicide on the lonely ocean
rocks, by merely leaving their clothes and pawn-
tickets behind them; and I take it that the
Reinach incident shows that the time has also
arrived when dumping stones in coffins will cease
to be a successful death-dodge. No, the world
having grown experienced, a corpse will hence-
forth always have to be provided.
Which reminds me of a most extraordinary
story that tells of what happened once in the Aus-
tralian Land of the Crocodile.

Bill Jumps was a prosperous trader, store-

Bill made money so fast that it was a puzzle even
to his cutest and most intimate friends. At that
time the Commercial Banking Co., of Sydney, was
the fountain of nearly all N.Q. business transac-
tions. Money was paid over, and change paid
out, by cheques, I O U’s, and all sorts of queer
paper.
It was naturally a boon to the “ joey ’ -cheque
trade. Smart, gentlemanly fellows travelled all
over the Gulf and lived on the fat of the land on
cheques drawn on well-known firms. If the
public wouldn’t cash one, they would remark
airily—“ Well, what cheque will you take?”
“ Old Slinkura’s.” “Good.”
Then they would slip out to their camp—or, as
the term was, their saddle —and return noncha-

Those dammed unions, I suppose.”
with just-written ink !
I’nbby would t. kc it, giving many cheques,
T O U’s., &c., in return, having to put up
with the scornful rejection of certain cheques, as
“not being good enough to pass along the road
we're going.”
Those cheques would be for months in circula-
tion at times, most old “pinoneers” knowing in
which direction to get rid of the joeys. Bill
Jumps was a “pinoneer.”
# • •
But the longest-tailed cat stands the worst
chance with a smart dog, and it happened some-
how that a parcel of Bill’s joeys got astray.
Notice was long in those days, and the arm of the
law slow and short in the Gulf.
» # •
Kiptown had two sudden sensations. A
black-tracker had got “bushed.” And Bill Jumps
had vanished.
Swiper Joe, Jumps's best bar-customer, vowed
he’d find Bill. (And he did.)
Other search-parties went out, but could pick
up no tracks. Swiper Joe played a lone hand.
One day Swiper came back in a fiercer sweat
than customary, and swore he had got the biggest
gatur that had ever kept a private boarding-house
in Jumper Ant Creek. He had shut it clean
through the neck and liver, and he guessed it
would float in a day or two.
“ What about Bill .1 umps ? ”
“Oh, I’ve given him best, an’ T aint agoin to
lose a 2;l-ft crockydile’s pelt for no wandering
delirium tremens cove.”
So the hoys started out to Jumper Ant Creek to
fetch in the orocky.
“ lie seems rather bulgy,” says Ben Blinks.
“’Spect his dinner disagreed with him,” says
Swiper, “or else he’s swole up since I gave him a
change of diet. Here goes to explore his iu’ards. ”
“Gosh ! It’s a man !,”
“Them’s Bill Jumps’s leggin’s, I’ll swear,” says
Swiper. “ That’s his cabbage-tree. Well, of all
the you’d a thought if the ’gatur could have
digested Bill Jumps’s carcase, he wouldn’t be
baulked on his leggings.’’
The body was undoubtedly that of the lost Bill
Jumps. Fragments of his clothing were distinctly
identified. His skull was almost intact and
various bones remained. Many a drunken sob
went up to heaven from Swiper Joe, who swore
by all his living jingoes and holy frosts and other
deities that the remains of Bill should have decent
burial—and Christian burial, too, for “if ever I
seen a Christian who could pass a joey cheque
Bill was the out an’-ontest.”
“ Where’s his pile?”
“Spect lie forwarded it to Sydney by last
month's steamer. There’s some pulp here that
looks like joeys, but I don’t see no shammy-leather
bag, with dust.”
Well, so it was. A parson buried Jumps, spoke
a long and stiring speech about his virtues, and
joined afterwards in the absolutely essential
whisky hooroar. And when a will was found,
making Swiper sole heir of Jumps’s possessions
and insurance money, why Swiper opened a free
bar all night, and the boys held a brandy-ball and
nearly burned and danced the humpy down.
# # *
Many years after, Benjamin, who had
meantime picked up a pile, returned from a
“ tower ” round the world, and was duly welcomed
by Swiper Joe, now a J.P. and with a strong
political chance of becoming an M.P. and even a
Minister of the Crown. (As a matter of fact, he
only reached one of the Australian Legislative
Councils, giving Bananaland best).
“ Look yere, Joe. I’m blest if I did not meet
Bill Jumps in London. Him as the halligator
yanked. Him as left you his money. It gave me
an orful turn. I thought it was his ghost. But I
bails him up, and he took it all right, and we
liquored up together, and it was Jumps.”
Swiper Joe gave a heavenly wink : “They do
say as ghosts rise from the dead sometimes.”
“Oh, stow that. What was the fake, Joe?”
“Do you remember the black tracker what was
lost, same time as Jumps cleared ?”
“ You don’t say?” said Ben, excitedly.
“Well, the blackfellers says that they ‘jump
up whitefellers ’ when they die. But that’s the
first time I knowed a blackfellow to ‘jump up’ a
white carkiss inside a crockydile ! And to think
we gave the carkiss Christian burial!”
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Jack Blackham, ever since he dined at the
famous Izaak Walton Inn, in Derbyshire, has
devoted his leisure to angling, either in the Yana
or Port Phillip Bay. The other day he got
chatting with another fisherman who didn’t know
him. Cricket turned up, of course. “Glad
Bruce is doing well,” said the stranger ; “by the
way, what’s become of old Jack Blackham; I don’t
see his name figuring now.” “ Oh, he’s got a bad
hand,” volunteered John McCarthy B. “Has
he? Sorry to hear that.” “Do you know him ?”
“What I Know old Jack Blackham? Hah!
that’s pretty good ! Ha, ha, ha? Why every-
body knows old Jack Blackham. I'd know him a
mile off.” This fairly “ stumped ” Jack, who says
he’s generally “ recognised ” at much shorter
range than a mile.
Disease ci'eeps Upon us Unawares, like an
assassin in the dark, and whose dangerous
proximity we never suspect until it makes the last
fatal clutch On some vital organ. We are always
warned in ample time of the impending danger,
but with criminal carelessness neglect these warn-
ings. That tired feeling, those aching limbs, and
that grand feeling one day and seedy condition
the next, the sour taste on waking in a moaning,
and the frequent sick and splitting headaches all
make their debiU before serious illness sets in.
All or any of these symptoms indicate the approach
of disease; they are faithful signs that the liver
and kidneys are not doing their duties, that the
morbid and effete matter, instead of being
eliminated from the system, is being retained, and
is positively poisoning and destroying the whole
physical structure. Neglect in such cases is
criminal. Recourse to rational treatment should
b ■ had at once. Clements Tonic should he taken
to strengthen the digestion, purify and fortify the
blood, to stimulate the liver, and brace up the
kidneys, to resolve and eliminate the poisonous
urea. Li ver and kidney complaints are the most
prevalent diseases of this country, and so long as
we consume such large quantities of animal food
and condiments, and drink so freely of tea and
stimulants, so long will this unhealthy condition
last. It is this mode of life that causes such
numbers of deaths from heart disease, Bright’s
disease, dropsy, Cancer, inflammation and enlarge*
ment of the liver, and similar causes, all of which
herald their approach by feelings of lassitude,
headache, languor, &c., and if prompt treatment
at once is adopted by a regular use of Clements
Tonic, the progress of disease is arrested, the
stomach, liver and kidneys resume their normal
action, and the poisonous accumulations are
expelled the system ,and normal health is restored.
That Clements Tonic is reliable is proved beyond
all question, and we have grateful beneficiaries in
every town and village who are conli mally
writing us in terms as did Mark Brody, Esq.,
High-st., Frankston, who writes :—“1 can assure
you nothing will give me greater pleasure than to
let the public- know what Clements Tonic has
done for Mrs. Brody. When a girl about 17 years
of age she caught a severe cold, which turned to
bronchitis, and for two years after she suffered
with nervous exhaustion accompanied by head-
ache, neuralgia and lowness of spirits. Several
doctors were consulted in the matter, some saying
one thing, some another. One stated that one
lung was completely gone and the other badly
affected. No. 2 said she was suffering from a
complication of diseases, and treated her for an
affection of the heart. Ever since then up till
about two months ago (and her age is now lu) she
has never been free from headache, or some of the
general ailments accompanied by the same low-
ness of spirit. About two months ago she tried
Clements Tonic, and finding that she received
some relief I procured more, and, now, to-day she
stands a living witness of the wonders it will
work, for no one that saw her a year ago would
think it was the same woman. Her appetite has
returned, and she has no need for help to do her
work, and, what is better, she is in good spirits.
I have recommended it to several, who, I know,
are using it with good results, and I shall continue
to make it known as much as possible.—Yours
very truly, Mark Brody, High-street, Frankston,
Victoria.”

Come to the Domain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cone to the Domain of “spouting,”
Come on Sunday after dinner,
That’s the time when men are shouting
Theories for saint and sinner.
After dinner saint and sinner get their notions
knocked about;
Reason strikes a new idea, Logic kicks an old one
out.
Come and hear the declarations
Bold with rhetoricians’ charms,
Floored by stormy contradictions,
Shaking fists and swaying arms.
Declaration, Contradiction, “ Yon maintain” and
“I deny,”
That’s the —social engine squeaking for some
lubrication—cry.
Come and hear the kind abstainers
Solve the myst’ry of the Sphinx,
And the Sydney tumbler-drainers •
Rather swallow it—in drinks.
Kind abstainers, telling drainers, “ Wine is mis’ry,
shame, and blood,”
Too forgetful that things were not quite the thing
before the Flood.
Come to the Domain and listen
To the cant of “ would-be ” teachers;
Come and see the tear-drop glisten
In the eyes of earnest preachers—
“ Would-be” teachers, earnest preachers, telling
sinners all about
How to get to certain places when they’ve pegged
their six feet out.
Come and see new speakers shaping—
Just emerging from the shell —
Come and twig the youngsters gaping
At the arguments on Hell— _ .
Speakers shaping, youngsters gaping, superstition
going “bung,” _
As irrev’rent jokers jeer it in the presence ot the
young.
See the Single Tacks projecting
(When our revenue grows less
By prohibitive protecting)
We will tax the land. I guess !
Their projection needs protection, but their points
have scratched the hand
Of protecting friendship proffered from the
foreign-trading band.
Come to the Domain of “ mashing,”
Come on Sunday afternoon,
Come when creed with creed is clashing
Cymbal-like to any tune.
Lovers mashing, bigots clashing, scenes of plea-
sure, themes of pain,
Ev’ry afternoon on Sunday, out in Sydney’s green
Domain.

The Prince of Wales has no reason to
doubt for one moment that “ my colonial friends ’

colonial! ”
The Argus would have Freetrade in
brains, apparently. Its columns are open to the
drivel of one “ H.H.L.,” who heaps scorn upon
the Protectionist, Sam Lister, of Bradford, for
having fought “lawsuit after lawsuit to prevent
anyone using or infringing his patent improve-
ments in wool-combing.” Lister’s motto is
“ Monopoly,” screams the Argus critic. Every
inventor tries to be a monopolist of his own in-
ventions. Yea, from the most liberal-minded
bard or novelist down to the author of Guinness’
Stout.
The Bulletin has not been uniformly
kind and considerate to Parkes, but it has never
allowed a correspondent to “ dedicate ” to the old
man such awful doggerel as was lately printed in
a prominent portion of the Age. Two verses :
•• Wool and iron ” bought abroad,
That is all Foreign earning.
We want to make them all at Home,
And that's for what we’re yearning.
Importers, foreign ship-owners,
For F’reetrade all are howling ;
But we stand by Home Industry,
Home Mining and Home Farming.
Parkes is no doubt shaky in his political principles
and poetry, but lie’s altogether a nobler intellect
than the man who attempted to crush him with
that rhyme “ Per favour of the Age.”
Dear Bulletin’, — I came across the Xmas
number of a cockney publication (the Lady’s
Pictorial, or something) the other day, and read
therein a yarn which had been advertised as the
“Special Xmas Story” for the Australasian.
Enquiring further into this coincidence I found
that the “special "attraction had been “secured,”
not written, for the. Australasian, and then it
occured to me that the agricultural organ was
trying to tighten the silken bonds that bind, &c.,
Ac. How would one of these knock about stories
1,,.’“ secured ? ” And how many different papers,
pray, loaded up their sparkling Xmas Number
with this same heavy lump of literature? —Yours,
Melbourne.
At Port Melbourne Police Court the other
day, a Norwegian seaman was fined 10s. and costs
for assaulting a lady aboard ship. The lady stated
that she. was endeavouring to stop the accused tar
from stonshing the first mate on the high seas,
when the heartless ruffian kicked heron the breast.
Against this sad story a crowd of witnesses de-
posed that the lady had backed up the first mate,
whipped off her petticoat and proclaimed herself
“an American tighter” thirsting for the blood of
the accused. When she tried to scratch his eyes
out, the vile, unmanly creature had pushed her
away. This case should evidently have been
decided strictly on the petticoat question. When
a lady deliberately takes off her underwear and
prepares to give beans to the world at large, she
can't claim the usual allowance for sex in a police
court. The muddle-headed beaks of Port Mel-
iKiurne ought to have stood upon the petticoat and
delivered a decided judgment one way or the
other. Either this was a shamefully-used lady, or
a rampageous female who deserved to pay five
“ bob ” to the poor-box for getting a black eye.
For Influenza, Colds etc., Colemane and Son’s
Encidypte Extract is unrivalled.
Many ladies admire gray hair—on some other
pgraon—hut few care to try its effects on their
own charms. They need not. since Ayer’s Hair
Vigor restores gray hair to its original colour.

He Didn’t Anticipate Trouble.
AN amorous couple on the verge of committing
matrimony entered a Paddington bus the
other night, and oblivious of the presence of a
third pa«senger, who to all appearance was enjoy-
ing a comfortable nap in the top corner,
commenced billing and cooing in dead earnest.
Of course the conversation turned upon the sub-
ject of their approaching nuptials, and many were
the expressed anticipations of the joy that awaited
them in that estate which all are anxious to enter
into and not a few would be glad to obtain release
from. “ Ah,” whispered the fair one, suppressing
a mild, hysterical sob, “ what a pleasure it will be
for me to listen to all your troubles and share all
your griefs.” “ But, darling,” rejoined the hope-
ful Romeo, “ I have no griefs nor troubles.
‘■Oh, but you will have plenty, you know, when
we are married,” added she, with ingenuous
emphasis. The passenger in the corner coughed,
and a silence followed that would have tipped
down the scale at 300 pounds. The prospective
benedict assumed a thoughtful mood. Cp to that
moment he had regarded marriage as an unmixed
blessing—a path strewn with roses—not even
once pausing to think of the discomfort attending
a pair of feminine cold feet, of an icy reception
after a late night at the lodge or club, of a colicky
baby with leathern lungs and a voice like the
shrillest of steam whistles, or of bruised and
lacerated fingers, the combined result of unskil-
fulness, a blunt tomahawk, and a chunk of knotty
firewood. These, however, are among the little
troubles that the average young man undertaking
one of the great responsibilities of life must look
oat for, and the best thing for him to do is to
scothe the self-inflicted injuries of inexperience,
and to prevent the attack of chill or rheumatism
which shooting by night at lightning speed out
of a warm bed, and rushing wildly along linoleum •
covered passages in quest of paregoric will in-
evitably bring, is always to have in the house
ready for use a supply of St. Jacobs Oil, the great
conqueror of all pain. Mr. John Breakwell, or
Milson’s Point-road, North Sydney, gratefully
acknowledges : “I have suffered severely tor
some years from rheumatism in my knees, and
have tried many remedies. I have found St.
Jacobs Oil gives me great relief, and am pleased
to speak in praise of it.”

[?]
846 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, Jan. 4, 1893,
My Dear Moorabinda,—
I wonder what shades of difference the society scribess
who keeps her eagle eye on gilded events, descries in the
various weddings that one is “a pretty wedding,”
another “an interesting wedding” (1 remember one
weird paragraph alluding to a wedding as an “ interesting
event!”), a third a “solemn ceremony,” etcetera! To
the average onlooker one wedding is much the same as
the other, except that the bridesmaids are a telescopic
quantity and the bridegroom is sometimes a shade too
brilliant in the colour of his trousers.
It is always safe to speak of a marriage as “interest-
ing”—all women find it so—accordingly that current
adjective doesn’t need explaining. The average woman’s
notion of a “pretty wedding” is one where the bride is
spliced under a floral bell and spruce little girls throw
rose-leaves at her as she marches her victim to the white-
horsed carriage. And I suppose a solemn ceremony is
the dreary sacrifice where the bride is 45 and says “ I
will ” like the snap of a trigger, and the bridegroom
boards with her ma?
There are very few girls possessed of a big or little
brother who don’t sometimes fervently wish that he or
they had never been born. Brothers are the fly in many
a sister’s ointment—but it is fortunately only seldom that
one of them gives his sister away on her marriage-morn,
as happened at a Sydney wedding recently. At the break-
fast he rose to propose the bride’s health. “ I hope,” ha
said, “that my sister will be very happy—but I can assure
the bridegroom that he will be a lucky man if she sews on
a button for him. She never put a stitch in for .mb in her
life.” Then he satdown with the solemn air of a youth
who had done his duty, and the bride suddenly found
that she had only five minutes left to catch the train in.
A N.S. W. squatter’s bride had a dreadful experience
recently through dressing in a hurry. She had got into
the white robes of sacrifice at express speed—bolted into
the buggy and rushed off to the townghip church where
an admiring mob awaited her, and it was only' when she
commenced a blushing descent that she remembered she
hadn’t.changed her boots. A pair of house-boats—l mean
bools—loomed, hoof-like, from beneath her snowy dra-
peries, and the only redeeming feature was that the
bridegroom wasn’t looking.
No woman, “under any pretext whatever” (as the
theatrical managers say when they want to stem the tide
of dead-heads) should allow herself to be rushed over her
dressing on her wedding-day. For no well-regulated
bride with a proper regard for the unities could be seen
taking in a reef with her mouth full of pins when once she
arrived at the church—she has got to go through with (he
thing on her merits even if her veil is hanging by one
corner and her collar choking her.
It has taken me a week to get over my astonishment at
at the dazzling splendours of Sydney Lyceum Theatre,
where blue and yellow plush have it all th ir own impres
sionist way in the dress-circle, and a blue plush curtain of
fabulous price hangs in a golden frame. I don’t like the
drop—l’m not in sympathy with painted palaces, and
gondolas, and marionette figures in cloaks. And I’m sure
the youth who squires a hen-party doesn’t like the dainty
salons opening on to a fern-shaded balcony which are
delightful features in the new play-house, built with
extravagant roominess everywhere. The youth—as I was
saying—won’t like the salons, because you can get ice-
cream and other lady-loved refreshments there—which
means another saveloy lunch for Gussie after every time
he takes Tottie to the play. Sydney Lyceum is a very
society edifice, and I hope local femininity will endeavour
to dress up t) it, and not sneak in looking as if they had
done their love-locks in the dark, and had thrown them-
selves sartorially on the mercy of a home-made cashmere
opera cloak—as they sometimes used to at the “Royal.”
When a lavish management poises you in a golden chair,
and conducts you thither on a golden carpet, the least
you can do is to use the clothes-brush vigorously before
starting.
“Little Red Riding Hood”—the Lyceum’s first-born—
does spectacular credit to her environment, and although
the attire of some of the girls makes them seem eligible
for a vote for thrift, there is no niggardly economy in
their display of beauty. Alice Leamar, in the name-part,
doesn’t change her grey skirt (even pantomime virtue is
expressed by a mousey tint) and red hood until the last
act, when she looks like a wedding bon-bon in white
brocade and silver, set off by absorbing pink tights and
silver meshes with plum >d hat en suite, worn by Ad.lie
Conyers when Red Riding Hood and Hoy Blue pose so
confidingly in the big gold wedding-ring of the transforma-
tion scene.
The management have done full justice to Miss Conyers
ftn d clothed her in marvellous blue tights, and not in
martial scarlet and stage mail, which the strapping Addie
carries superbly. Cora Tinnie, more garrulous than the
Gaiety people ever let her be, looks like the girl who gels
painted on the posters, in doublet and trunks of yellow
and black with fur round the collar and effective string of
diamonds—and Courtneidge’s Watteau jacket in blanket
dimmed with green ribbons is a lovely smack at the
oolish virgin who patronises Cheap Jack for what can
on 'y he cut by a tailor.
The first day of Tattersall’s New Year meet at Rand-
J'ick was spoilt by rainy, unsettled weather; only one
society girl appeared on the Mcmbers’-stand, like one
"ok in a thunder-storm.
Racecourses seemingly can’t help being haunts of
o gory. Somebody told me the simple story of a puhli-
’an who wanted to dispense heady liquids at an Austra-
mn ra ce-meeting (not to be too particular) and who
PPlied to the secretary for the right of way, or whatever
it la, to the grand-stand bar—and got it. “But,” said
the secretary, “you must have an assured brand of stuff
in there. Give the outside people what you like, but we
can t have ’em poisoned in the paddock." “Of course
thers is a higher charge,” said the hotel-man, but the
secretary calmly replied, “Oh, no—same price all over
the course !’’ This paragraph ought to be as good as a
temperance-lecture to the shilling seats.
The unexpected showers and shine on the second day of
Tattersall s Club meeting were in lovely harmony with
the running. The noticeable thing about Members’-stand
style was a marked tendency to black picked out with
something that caught the eye. Mrs. W. Mitchell wore a
trained black woollen with yoke and cuffs of gold-and-
black bullion embroidery ; little bonnet to match. Mrs.
Burdekin wore an involved garment of black, “ luck,
pointed (as the architects say) with green ; sma'i
bonnet en suite. A well-known society girl wore
a grandmotherly gown of black silk and lace, which
made her look like her married sister, who wore
a mulberry vest with an Eton suit and a rough
straw’ hat simply trimmed with a bow of prune velvet.
Miss Myra Kemble sported a charming get-up of biscuit-
coloured silky stuff with yoke and sleeves of old-gold silk
covered with guipure embroidery, the bodice cut seamless
after the French fashion, the skirt finished with an old-
gold silk frill; black grenadine hat trimmed with black
and yellow’. Miss Rankin wore a black gown flowered in
mauve with front of green silk, neat hat in black jet and
touch of green. A very swagger frock was of stone-
coloured silk (worn by a Queensland lady) which measured
the ultra-fashioned nine yards round the hem, and was
tiimmed on the bodice with emerald-green velvet—but
the laurel-w reath of splendour must go to a lady in copper-
coloured silk punctuated with large bunches of mauve
and green and red and white flowers at the rate of one
every now and then. This neat thing in upholstery was
w orked up to parrokeet pitch by rows of scarlet gimp and
topped off by a black hat heavily trimmed w'th mauve.
The lady was appropriately built, of course. Whenever a
substantial siren catches sight of a pattern that can be
heard above the traffic she invariably plunges in and pur-
chases 15 yards.
There must be a lot of strange people come to Sydney
for the New Year. It is advertised that a “lizardskin
lady s purse has heen lost. A lizardskin lidy is quite a
new departure in girls—even at pantomime time. I sup-
pose her name is “Gohanna.”
Apropos of nothing, it’s not only Sir George Dibhs who
feels Ike anathematizing Chicago. The latest apple of
discord is that somebody wants to go, officially, and pay
her own footing, and considers it a cheap way of getting
at all the privileges appertaining to the position, while
somebody else is desperately anx'ous to go, but wants to
have her way paid for her out of the Treasury. Looks
simple enough on paper - but there isn’t a phonograph in
the world big enough to hold all the talkee-talkie.
The Madame Soldene benefit concert in Sydney Towr,
Hall on New Year’s Eve attracted a satisfactory audience
especially in the popular part of the building, but, taking
the programme as a whole, a mob of two deaf mutes anc
an imbecile w’ould have been the most suitable audience
fw the occasion. The “Lohengrin” trio (Wiegand,
“Pussy” Poussard and Hu norbein); the “Faust” duo
for organ and piano (Wiegand and Miss Griffith), and
Poussard’s “Scotch Fantasia,” were soothing instru-
mentally, and Madame Soldene’s neat phrasing and
artistic singing in “ 1 Love Him So Mr. Farley’s “ Les
Rameaux and perhaps Mr. VValshe’s “Love is a Dream”
(though it might have been “ Love is a very, very hard-
boiled egg," for all the fervour he put into his singing
voice), w’ere the only vocal items in a bill nineteen shrieks
long.
Miss Ada Colley, in white satin and tulle, with very
fair hair, dressed in spangled bands, cut a charming
figu’-e on the platform, and her childish voice rang
shrilly in “The Little Birds,” but the rest of the amateurs
were badly dressed and very raw, and turned the .show-
in to a pupils’ concert. Kowalski, by the way, was billed
to assist, but, owing to an accident at the last moment,
couldn’t appear.
Apropos concerts, it’s a strange spectacle to see the
extremely undressed lady at the piano accentuate in her
person the throbbings and gaspings intended to convey
deep feeling in the prima donna. If our songstress is
drawing her breath in agonized gasps that set the paste
necklace gyrating like a ship at sea the lady at the wheel
is seen to be billowing o’er with emotion at the same
time. And when joy comes at last to the singer a beatific
smile is seen to break all over the accompanist’s visage
too. You see something like it when an impressionable
girl goes to the play and reproduces, as she watches him,
all the grimaces of the funny man.
That was indeed an awkward accident which happened
to M. Kowalski. He had hurt his finger, and, on the
advice of a friend, applied some spirit to it. A few
moments afterwards he happened to light a match, and
the flame caught the bandage—resulting in a terrible
burn which, it was for a time feared, might have for ever
silenced him as a pianist.
The latest soapy story of a Southern hotel, where all
the bath-rooms have partitions which end before they
reach the ceiling, concerns a barrister and a prima donna
much addicted to whistling. By standing on the edge of
the bath one bather might observe the other, and as the
occupant of the next compartment was whistling like a
bird, the barrister(not thinking, of course, that the siffleur
was a woman), mounted nimbly on the edge of his tub
and popped his head over the partition. “ Would you
please lend me the soap?” he said, politely—but he didn’t
wait to get it. The vision of a charming nymph in the
bathing-costume of the year One. made him drop off his
perch like a bird hit by a catapult.
I have received from Mr. J. Franca a copy of the
“ Nithsdale Schottische, played with great success by
Need’s Band.” The schottische is a not particularly tune-
ful composition, but the beat is as regular as that of a
piston-rod, and that is really all one wants. You may
like a melting tune with trimmings but the machine-made
article, played on a barrel-organ, is the most satisfactory
dance-music, after all.
Bondi (N.S.VV.) Aquarium was dominated by N.Q.
aboriginals last Saturday—the crowd that Mr. Me-ilon has
got together for exhibition in Chicago. Mr. M. made an
inaudible lecture from the platform, an 1 wore his nether
garments turned up at the hem ; and I do hope he will
orate better in America, where the stump orator, in
dtzzling store clothes, has been brought to an aitonishing
pitch of voluble audibility.
It was very interesting to see the aboriginals throw the
boomerang, slide the snakey “ducoon” through the
grass—spear a sheet of bark and climb up and down the
switchback supports like monkeys. They are firm-look-
ing men, with skins like well washed potatoes, sparsely
decorated with white war paint. The beau of the lot was
a well-knit youth primitively got up in a pair of blanket
trunks and a bunch of gaudy feathers on each arm, and
he was run pretty close in the matter of abbreviated style
by a gentleman with a red flannel band round his skull.
The king was there attired in all the cold i.dendour of a
bead necklace, and so was the queen. Her sable
Majesty’s crop of tightly-curled black wool was the very
apotheosis of a civilised bang.
One popular thing Mayor Manning has done is to erect
a much-needed portico over the front steps of Sydney
Town Hall. On wet evenings the flight from your vehicle
to the mat was a terribly sloppy experience, with a two-
to-one chance that you might have to turn and go home
again with a dress all draggled round the frill. 1 saw a
girl fall on the slippery steps one evening, splash all the
front of her dress, and go away in tears, and many a hang
has hung dismally into its owner’s eyes because of that
unprotected entrance.
Yours affectionately,
SATTHO SMITH.

Yalwal has always been the N.S.W. mining
terra incognita. Where, on earth, is Yalwal?” is often
asked, and in nine cases out of ten the conundrum is
unanswered. Yet the biggest battery in N.S.W. is there
Bound, of 50 heads. There Is another
Of 40 heads, the Pioneer, and, what is more important,
both are kept going night and day. What they turn out
the pubhc never know. Also, as a matter of course,
both mines are owned and managed by Victorians. Both
are worked by open cuts, and the ore consists of soft slate
and other mullock, intersec'ed with small veins and fibres
of quartz rich in gold, but whether the body, crushed,
goes one dwt. or an oz ,we have no information. If the
mines were in Victoria the owners would be compelled to
publish their returns. Why not in N.S.W. ? A small
N.S. W. syndicate, inoluding John Newton, has a lease at
the foot of the hill, on which the Homeward Bound and
rmneer are situated, and have driven a tunnel over 4Coft.

Extract from a letter from Gnaroine, W.A. •
“ This field is not as good as the Murchison, hut there is
one man (Bayley) getting plenty of gold. Three specks
got recently, were 700z5., 30ozs. and 12ozs. At time of
writing, it is too wet to dry-blow, and not wet en.aigb
to wash, but one party is sinking for water. Flour 10d

One Alfred Jeffery palmed off an
“original” story on Cassels, the London pub-
lishers. Unfortunately for him, Cassels submitted
it to the man who had written and published it a
couple of years before. Jeffery was arrested and
committed for false pretences.
The S.A. Post and Telegraph Office, the
worst managed institution of its kind this side
of the line, has managed to burn 30 letters and
half destroy scores of others in a Krishmish
fumigation. Todd, C.M.G., has too much to do.
tie is Postmaster-General, Superintendent of
Telegraphs, and Government Astronomer, while
he fills in spare time by making hideous puns and
attending Conferences in the adjacent provinces.
Sydney Truth (now conducted by our old
comrade, Traill) remarks that the best resource of
Miss Shaw, the Times commissioner, would
probably have been to hunt up Sir Samuel
Griffith’s own speeches on the Kanaka question,
of some years back, as a politician and as a
criminal lawyer. “We understand that Miss
Shaw must shortly return to London. She ex-
plained recently that she absolutely must get
back, because a twelve months’ absence would
cause her to lose all the threads of events at
home. Now, Miss Shaw has been absent from
these colonies longer than that. She has been
absent all her life, yet she professes to have
gathered and unravelled the most tangled clues of
Australian affairs within a few months.
To judge by a verdict given in N.S.W.
District Court, in re electioneering expenses
alleged to have been incurred in Hawkesbury
constituency on behalf of that inarticulate politi-
cal dunderhead millionaire, Burdekin, M.P., the
N.S.W. electoral laws need a little attention in
respect to definitions as to “undue influence.”
The plaintiff declared that Burdekin's general
instructions were : “Do for me as you did for
Mr. Bowman’’—the late member—“and I shall
be very well satisfied ; use your own dis-
cretion and be liberal.” In consequence of
which, the plaintiff “ Look buggies and went cut
canvassing, . . . he shouted freely. He
generally took a bottle of whisky with him when
he went out canvassing. Plaintiff was outside
scrutineer on the polling-day, and lie spent some
■£S in drinks on that day.” The plaintiff sued for
-034 18s. ; the defendant paid ,010 into Court,
but said in the witness-box that he was willing to
pay what Honor thought was a fair thing.
Thereupon the Judge thought 04 more, with -01
4s. costSj and the expenses of two witnesses, was
* fair thing.

Opinions of the Press.
Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.” —Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.”—“Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.” — Australian Star.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktown Courier (Q.).
“ It may not be out of place to mention that Herr
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times.
“Herr Rassmussen’s press notices in all the other
colonies agree in regard to the skill he possesses as a Herba-
list, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to be well
established.”— S. A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen has achieved a high reputation for
his skill in botanical treatment of disease.” — Evening
Journal, Adelaide.

A Game of Euchre.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I once spent tliree days with Honi Wetere Te
Rerenga ( Anrjlice , John Wesley the Snag) at his
principal village on the Mokau (M.L.)
The rest of the party wanted to see the snow-
crowned summit of Ruapehu at short range; I had
a sore heel and was principally interested in the
problem of how to quickly cultivate some
epidermis thereon.
Three days with a cannibal chief just pardoned
after 20 years’ outlawry for murder ! That’s an
experience anyway.
First we played euchre ; a hundred of potatoes
on the game and a pig on the rubber! Wetere
had his greenstone mere or war-club beside him.
“ What him for?” I asked in pigeon English.
“S’pose you cheat!” replied the boss Ngati-
maniapoto.
I presume that he noticed a slight tremor of
fear on my face as I put down “ the Dutchman’s
point,” for he said, “ Always the whole time long
when I play euchre and a taurikarika (slave) and
him cheat, crack him skull.” Then he paused,
spat into the ovm of stones, and added, senten-
tiously, “ No taurikarika in this kainga cheat me
now.”
I played fair and owed Wetere three sacks of
potatoes and a pig.
Then we tried Yankee grab.
“ Kia kaha,” said the chief, as he set a main of
eighteen for the fourth time running.
“ What’s that in English, Wetere?” I asked.
“ Oh 1 It mean * Be plenty strong all the time,’ ”
said he.
“ Well, Wetere, you’re too jolly strong for me!’
said I, picking up a “ tat ” all fives and sixes that
he had rung in. “ Where you get him ?”
“ Kimball Bent make him for me. You no tell
Mitchelson ?’
‘‘No, Wetere, I won’t tell Mitchelson.”
“Kapai; then you no pay me potatoes and
pigs?”
“No, Wetere ! Bet your life I won’t.”
And that’s the last time I gambled with a
gentleman who played with a greenstone club
within arm’s length.
J. A. PHILP.
A prominent N.Q. civil servant has been
getting himself disliked a good deal of recent
years. He is an old, reliable drunkard, and is
related to a well-known politician. He held a
billet for some time in a town near the Gulf, but
when he began to run about the streets in an
advanced state of undress, the inhabitants peti-
tioned almost unanimously for his removal. He
was removed accordingly— to a better billet in
another town, with a handsome rise of salary. He
celebrated this promotion with some more
wild orgies, in the course of which he
had to be carried home on several occa-
sions ; also, he tried to run amok in the
town hall, fought several rounds with the door-
keeper, manifested a desire to commit suicide
with a razor, and delivered one or two thrilling
lectures on snakes in the principal street of the
town. Then he settled down in a saturnine mood
in his office, and when anybody called on business
he either told him briefly to go to perdition, or
else informed him that he was of illegitimate des-
cent and that his mother eloped with a Chinaman.
At latest advices he still holds the fort manfully—
except when be comes out and rushes after some-
body with a saw and the inhabitants are
petitioning unsuccessfully for his removal.
Advocates of Woman’s Rights,” remarks
an American writer, “ must not seek in Renan’s
writings for arguments to support their cause.
For all his admiration of woman, he does not
desire to see her moulding herself after the male
model. He only admires womanly women ; he
has no words strong enough to condemn the blue-
stocking. Indeed, be loVes her so well that ho
loves her faults, so long as they are womanly
faults. Thus he says :■ ‘ The woman who most
resembles ns is antipathetic. What we look for in
the other sex- is the opposite of ourselves. Weak-
ness, false reasoning, narrow ideas, ignorance,
superstition, shock us in a man; they make us
smile in a woman. We like to see a graceful hand
make the sign of the cross. Narrow duties ought
to have corresponding narrow ideas. Faith in
woman is a virtue, it must be respected alike with
all feminine virtues. It is a mistake to believe
that we are desirous of bringing women round to
our philosophical opinions. On the contrary, we
are often glad they will not listen to us. We
admire their preconceived determination not to
listen to what might weaken their heroic resolu-
tion. I should be grieved to have in any way
assisted in diminishing piety in woman. Pietnx,
taken in its fine Latin sense, meaning tenderness
and weakness, is the excellent gift that has fallen
to their share. When I last went to Brittany, I
was happy to see that the young girls there were
as pleasing, as modest, as well brought up as 50
years ago. My one desire is that they shall go on
being so. I shall be consoled if I can know, after
my death, that women are as pretty and that love I
is as sweet as it used to be.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Ever since the lolanthe disaster in Sydney har-
bour all the loose cranks in N.S.W. have been writing to
the papers. One of them wants a regulation that no
women or children are to go out in sailing-boats. Another
wants a police launch to follow every sailing boat that
goes out and see that the people on board know how to
manage it—quite regardless of the fact that it would
require 150 police launches for the work, and that they
would probably run each other down in the confusion,
and that a policeman’s opinion on the subject doesn’t
amount to much anyhow. A third individual desires
that nobody should be allowed to go out till he
knows how to manage a boat—in other words, he
isn’t to go into the water till he can swim. A
fresh spectre proposes that every boat-owner should
put the man who hires a boat through an examination,
and if he can’t pass he shouldn’t have the boat. A violent
crank writes to say that the people who hire boats are no
good ; it is only the capitalist who has a boat of his own
who can be trusted on the water. Somebody else sends
in a verse of a hymn, and draws attention to Thessalonians,
iv., 13-8 ; I Corinthians, xv. ; and Romans, x., 9-10 ; also,
another party wants jibing abolished by Actof Parliament,
and thinks the main-sheet shouldn’t be more than two
feet over the wash-board. The rest are convinced that no
sailing boat should be allowed to go out except in a dead
calm. The only practical suggestion is that the sail-area
of hired boats carrying women and children should be
minimised. Every additional few feet of mast means tons
more weight on a boat’s gunwale.

A falling-off in the racing crowd at Caulfield
(Melb.) on Boxing Day was explained, in the stupid

counter attractions at Xmas time as though they
never had to be reckoned with before, and were an
unlooked-for misfortune to the shows that don’t happen
to boom. The intercolonial match on Boxing Day is a
venerable fixture, older than the meeting at Caulfield.

As the butcher’s boat neared the ship Oakland,
five miles off Newcastle, N.S.W., an individual, with the
frame of a 16mo. Hercules and the voice of a stentor,
lumped upon the rail and asked the boatmen who was
champeen fighter of Newcastle. The watermen yelled
back the name of a local pug., whereupon the sailor
vociferously announced that he would fight hbn for love
or mousy—principally mousy. When the tout* board..
the vessel, this belligerent seaman asked if they thought
he could make much money fighting in Australia. The
master-tout sarcastically informed him that the loser’s
end of a few purses would bring him in about a pound a
month, without, however, damping the bloodthirsty
ardour of the new arrival; for as soon as he got ashore,
he hied him to the boxing-hall and interviewed George
Powell. The next day he was informed two local
fighters were yearning to fight him. “ Well,” said he,
“ that kinder puts me in a fix. If I fight oae, the other
will probably say I’m afraid. I’ll have to knock ’em both
out in one night." He was serious, and the matches were
arranged in accordance with his wishes. He did not want
any training, and would fight any night. Black Sam
came on first, and after four-and-a-half rushing rounds,
the nigger breathlessly implored his seconds to “ chuck
up der -chair,” as he could not be expected to fight the
hind leg of a dray-horse. After a short spell the sailor
said he was ready for the next course, and Corrigan, a
powerful fellow, with some pretensions to science, was
pitted against him. In the tenth round the sailor suc-
ceeded in completely inco-ordinating his second opponent,
and thus fulfilled his self-imposed contract. The name of
this gluttonous man-batterer is Tom Ball.

Some Up-South smarties have just found out
that it doesn’t pay to be too clever. They have been
working a concern for a company, taking the by-proauots
for their remuneration and giving the company the prin-
cipal product free of cost. By working/or the by-products
they so reduced the output of the principal stun that tne
company couldn’t earn interest on its capital, so me
clever gentry got the whole concern at their own price.
Up went the output of the principal product and down
went the by-ones, till the thing was put into fine trim ipi
floating in England. They were just about scooping in
the dollars when- their game was knocked sky-nign
through the Englishmen getting hold of the returns toi
the previous five years. “For our purposes we must
have high-grade and not low-grade stuff,” was the cabled
consequence. And once more the keen-witted speculators
aye wondering whether straightforwardness doesn t give
the best pay-dirt after all.

Dear Bulletin, —How difficult it is to get from

pertinent, current rates ; market very changeable and
the manager talks away until one rests assured the bank
is his godfather and his godmother and his affectionate
helpmate for life; yet his passbook after the balance
shows an amount that must be more than 71 per cent ,
average the overdraft and rates ever so high. It would
profit many a man to give his passbook to an accountant
and get the rate of interest charged discovered. I think
banks should be compelled to insert in all passbooks the
rate of interest charged, and a false statement be made
criminal.—Yours, 7J%? No, 10.

The Provident and Industrial Insurance Co., of
Maoriland, which has recently extended its business to
Sydney, is an amusing institution in its way. Its premium
income for the year ended 30th June, '92 was £4411, and
the working expenses £3575, or just about 81 per cent.,
and after paying claims—amounting to £77s—the glorious
total of £343 was added to the funds as the result of a
whole year’s work. The actuary “ sees no reason” why
a dividend of five per cent, should not be declared on the
paid up capital, and, so far as the layman s unin-
formed eye can estimate the situation, this will
absorb about £l5O, if the proposition is accepted,
and reduce the balance to a humble £193. The
company has been three years in existence, and has
been busy all that time issuing policies, and thereby
accumulating future liabilities, but apparently it takes
almost all its income to get the liabilities, and it hasn’t
time to save much to meet them at maturity. The total
funds in hand are £4515, of whicli nearly £3OOO are
capital, and about £1640 represents the “Assurance
Fund.” The industrial business -which is the ruinously
expensive variety of life-insurance —represents about
three-fourths of the company’s trade, and the rest is
ordinary life-insurance. As the all ■ round expenses
on both varieties of business are 81 per cent., this
seems to suggest that very nearly all the indus-
trial premiums go in exs. There are some weird
items among the assets: £1279 for “ extension of
business’’and an item of “ preliminary expenses ” look
like debts instead of assets to the uninstructed eye ; any-
how, if the co. winds up, The Bulletin is prepared to
swear that it can’t sell its “preliminary expenses” or the
costs of “ extension of business ” and pay a dividend out
of the proceeds. We don’t seem to hanker after an
interest in the Provident and Industrial Insurance Co. of
Maoriland.

“IT IS THREE THOUSAND MILES
LONG.”
We allude to the great Mississippi River in
America. For hundreds of miles of its course it
is yellow with the earth which the swift current
has torn from its banks . Probably the Missis-
sippi bears constantly in solution ground enough
to make many a rich farm, though the amount is,
of coarse, greater at times of flood. Thus, for
drinkifig, and even for washing, the water of the
Mississippi must first be purified.
It is the same with anything which either for
appearance or utility is in some way thrown out
of character. For instance', the blood in our body
is a river. From the heart to the extremities it is
of a bright red colour, but on its return through
the veins it is dark and sluggish. The reason is
that when it starts from the heart it has just been
purified, and when it comes back it is loaded with
all sorts of refuse matter it has picked up in its
journey. In other words, the blood—which is
only food fully digested—carries life on its red
current and brings away disease and death on its
d&fk one.
Speaking of her own condition at a period about
six years since, a woman writes that her skin
gradually became first yellow and then of a saffron
colour. Connected with this she experienced
several symptoms of illness. She had more or less
pain at the sides and considerable difficulty in
breathing. Her appetite, previously good, began
to fail, and after eating comparatively little, there
was much distress in the region of the stomach.
There was an attendant loss of energy, both of
mind and body, and she felt tired, languid, and
weak. .
Now we must observe that in case of natural
fatigue from labour or any exertion rest is an
unfailing remedy. Sleep and relaxation renew
our powers. But there is a kind of fatigue which
rest does not relieve—for which the Angel of
Sleep bears no healing on his wings. What vile
counterfeit is it ? , ,
She adds: “ I finally took to my bed and was
visited by a doctor, who said my liver was wrong,
and that I had jaundice. He gave me medicine,
but as it had no good effect he advised me to go
to the hospital. As I objected to this, he Baid i
might try a change of air and see what that would
do for me. So I gave up my place and went to
my home at Fairford, in Gloucestershire. I ail-
ing to obtain any benefit from the change, I con-
sulted another physician, who attended me for
some time, but I grew no better. Whatever I did
I could not recover my strength, and my friends
thought I was in a decline.
“I did not eat enough to feed a bird, and began
to despair of ever recovering my health. With
many ups and downs in the way of feeling, and of
fear and hope, I lingered along until July, 1890,
when an acquaintance recommended me to try
Mother SeigePs Syrup. Indeed, so much was I
impressed with what was said about this medicine
that I sent my niece four miles to procure a bottle
of it. After taking the contents I felt better. A
w'eight seemed to be lifted from my chest, my
relish for food returned, and by degrees I found
myself in every way stronger. I will conclude by
saving that after having used two bottles more of
the Syrup I was able to return to Birmingham
quite well, and have had no signs of the ailment
since. It is only just to mention that I feel better
now than I have done for many years, and had I
sooner known of Mother Seigel’s Syrup I should
have avoided an amount of suffering and misery
which it saddens me even to look back upon.”
The lady referred to is Miss Sarah Hawkes, of
the “Lion Inn,” Longmore-street, Birmingham.
That yellow or saffron colour of the blood was
caused by the failure of the liver to secrete, or
take away, the bile from the blood. Remaining
in the blood it was carried to all parts of the body,
and necessarily showed itself through the skin in
the ghastly hue she names. .
Understand, please, that the bile, useful to help
move the bowels, is a poison when in the blood.
The entire malady of biliousness in all its forms
is a symptom of indigestion and dyspepsia, the
source of most of our aches, pains, and diseases.
It is no new thing to say that the success of
Mother Seigel’s Syrup in reviving the torpid
digestion, stimulating the liver, and thus purify-
ing the blood, sets it apart from all other medicines
as an article to be relied upon when the use of
ordinary drugs lias been followed only by disap-
pointment. The blood holds the secret of life,
and this remedy keeps that ruby river clear and
clean.


The majority of well-read phys-
icians now believe that Consump-
tion is a germ disease. In other
word's, instead of being in the con-
stitution itself it is caused by innu-
merable small creatures living in the
lungs having no business there and
eating them away as caterpillars do
the leaves of trees.
The phlegm that is
coughed up is those
parts of the lungs
which have been
gnawed off and destroyed. These
little bacilli, as the germs are called,
are too small to be seen with the
naked eye, but they are very much
alive just the same, and enter the
body in our food, in the' air we
breathe, and, through the pores of
the skin. Thence they get into the
blood and finally arrive at the lungs
where ‘they fasten and increase with
frightful, rapidity. Then German
Syrup comes in, loosens them, kills
them; expells them, heals the places
they* leave, and so nourish
soothe that, in a short time consump-*
lives become germ-proof and well. <9

Ballad of a Capitalist.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The charges that the vulgar herd
Again ,t us men of money bring
Are both unnatural and absurd,
And need but little answering :
So in your teeth this verse I fling,
And challenge you to find a flaw,
When I assert this sort of thing
Is in accord with natural law.
Why look : the little busy bee,
Of which the hymnal poets sing,
Unsexed, but quite content, we see,
Work bravely for its queen and king;
It lives for us illhstrating
That raven-Labour’s restive caw
Is wicked ; for its suffering
Is in accord with natural law.
We don’t unsex you ; thus we give
An advantage to the human thing ;
Take the concession—work and live
For us from whom such bounties spring.
Let’s hear no more of gathering
Riches for an “ insatiate maw ” :
Your state - although the truth may sting—
Is in accord with natural law.
L’Envoi.
Princes, accept this offering,
This proof which I first clearly saw ;
Misery and all that sort of thing
Is in accord with natural laic.

The husband was evidently unable to stick to his
bargain.
Dear Bulletin, —The Alice River Settle-
ment (C.Q.), now being run on Socialistic princi-
ples, was started by bootless “stonebrokers,” in
the worst aftermath of the shearers’ strike collapse.
Over 42 acres of heavy gidya-timbered country
have been cleared ; 33 acres are under cultivation;
several miles of stub-fencing have been completed;
a bakehouse, a kitchen, general dining-room, car-
penter’s shop, blacksmith’s shop, shoemaker’s shop
(all boots locally made), have been erected; also,
three cottages and two in course of erection. Some
of the men go to work outside and bring their money
back to the common fund ; every shilling is banked
as a reserve for food, tools, seeds, &c. ; and no
dividend can be declared for two years. Eight-
hour work is the principle, the work being
managed by elected heads of departments. They
recreate with cards, chess, draughts, &c., but lack
books. They have, been battling against a big
drought, the Alice being dry for months, which
necessitated the sending of the cattle and horses
30 miles for water. Yet their spring-cart goes
into Barcaldine every morning loaded up with
produce, and they are driving out the Chows.
They have a vineyard, also crops of potatoes,
maize, wheat, and oats. Lately, they obtained
the deeds of their land, five square miles, and
(says a letter) —“When our mates come home
with their cheques after shearing we mean to fence
in the block straight away. This will cost us
about <£2oo for wire alone; the timber and labour
we have on the ground.” There are only 32
members semaining, the balance not having had
the grit to wait longer for dividends. This only
represents 16 months’ start. What in 16 years ?
There are no bosses—all mates; no sack, no
strikers. —H.C.
The British Post-office, which the but-
toners of “our glorious constitution” generally
pretend is as “ tooralooral ” as that fraudulent
imposture, the Habeas Corpus Act —a noble pro-
vision which is invariably suspended whenever it
would do any service—is still “ Grahamised.”
The name is derived from the infamous Sir James
Graham, who, during the insurrectionary propa-
ganda by Mazzini to deliver Italy from the Aus-
trian yoke, intercepted correspondence from two
young Italian officers in the Austrian service to
Mazzini, then in exile in London, and surrendered
the letters to the Austrian Ambassador with the
result that the writers were hanged. Graham
pleaded that every British Ministry had habitually
violated the alleged secrecy of the Post-office.
Grahamising, we say, still goes on. “ The
police at Scotland Yard have examined
cipher communications describing the schemes.”
That is a recent cablegram relative to the
alleged anarchist plot. There is in the British
Foreign Office a secret cypher department of
experts, who are able, by familiarity with all cus-
tomary methods of secret writing, to interpret any
ordinary cypher. But there is one very simple
method of cypher communication which no export,
however capable, can unravel, although he will
know almost at a glance what the method is.
That is, for the parties to agree upon a book, each
having a copy, and to write just the numbers repre-
senting the page and line where each successive
word of their message occurs. Unless the
decypherist can hit upon the book, he is helpless.
Of course, the thing can be complicated by pre-
arranged substitution of one set of figures for
another, or of words or letters for figures, or, in
fact, by any number of such substitutions and per-
mutations. The skilled decypherist will quickly
unravel these accessories, but it would take him
fifty life-times, if he got no hint, to discover
which book among the millions published had
been chosen by the correspondents.

Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appears herewith, whereby she became
A. MYSTKRY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a oomph*
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long, as 30 hours at a stretch —frigid .as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ;
. • * n ji _ ■ v. kniiva’ alpprt
IUVVCI. IjVCI J llllllg lIIIUV liivuivi* co . , .
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mes
' Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it hut a hobby of his, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; hut they said, “ Try
it for sleep'only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
time she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when
I»o! Everyone was Startled
To find that whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was tar more avvaite,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
mile awav what was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away, and so forth. Then she was
requested’to look into her own body ; this she did, and w'as surprised herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
the cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure her.
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her,
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous powers of vision-
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England, America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
door- The Sensation was Immense!
Drawing-room. Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient-she gave directions how to soften the cancer to the
lancing state: this was done ; then, as they dare not give chlorof®rm on account of her heart, Mr. Harle put her undei
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap-
pened. Everyone said: “ Start and use your powers for doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself—in three months’ time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaeton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
w'as known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice, 1 ive years
ago Mrs. Hark opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district
and away in the bush discovering gold-mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state; some about business, but most about their health. Not one cao say : “lam worse for your
treatment ” whilst all who have followed the advice and treatment, rejoice in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every trouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or enables her to see just what medicine, and tow long it will take to cure it. often giving the
medicine three months ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning! , , . . ...
If vou wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-SOTnnmg, fortune-telling
crowd and the task is done. No such rubbish ! Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questions, etc. When
the mesmerist is undone, she awakes, and knows no more of what has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
or dead. jf, Q auges a Terrible Mental Strain,
Therefore Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is half-a-guinea for bodily examination, and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea includes a
complete tracing of your case, and a full statement of how to cure you. Businessmen have voluntarily paid as high as
£5 and even £l5, for the arrangement of a business tangle. She guarantees in all cases a full value in the treatment,
and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
man if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can be cured, but insists upon only
usintr her Eclectic Botanic Remedies-she has no faith in mineral medicines. It is desirable to make appointments 01

-412 GEORGE STREET, and STRAND ARCADE. SYDNEY. MELBOURNE and AUCKLAND,
The Meiamorphosis of Magindaus.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Nature had intended my neighbour, Andrew
Beal, for a scientist. Fate, and the decease of an
elder brother, made him the owner of a small
cattle-station. However, being smart and practical
enough, apart from his hobbies, he managed to
work the place profitably, and still find time to
pursue his experiments. His latest fad was the
reclamation of the aborigines by means of diet. I
used to listen patiently to his theories on the
subject; but to me, a blackfellow was simply a
blackfellow, he never could be any more, he never
could be anything else; and, moreover, he was
never intended to be anything else. lam quite
confirmed in that opinion now.
“Look at that fellow,” Beal would say, point-
ing to a young, lanky savage, with stupidity
written all over him. “In twelve months, under
a proper system of diet, I undertake to make him
the terror of the district.”
“Rot!” said I, impatiently.
“All right, but I’ll do it,” he returned savagely,
and walked back to the house.
Beal at once proceeded to act on his food theory.
What ungodly messes he fed that nigger on I
know not, but Magindaus (that was the nigger’s
heathen name) used to weep and protest bitterly,
and it was only by standing over him with a
pistol that Beal could at last induce him to
swallow some of the worst decoctions. There was,
however, no doubt about it; the nigger grew
abnormally strong and powerful. “As soon as he
is properly developed in body I will commence on
his brain,” Beal would remark.
Again I sneered. Magindaus was next door to
a blubbering idiot; whenever he was spoken to*
sharply, he used to sit down and cry. In a few
months under the dietary system he changed
entirely. He now stood six-feet-four and was
broad in proportion. If he became as violent in
his behaviour as he promised at present he cer-
tainly would be the terrorof thedistrict. Very soon
he began to assume an air of authority over my
friend to which the latter meekly submitted.
Frankenstein and his monster were nothing to it.
Mr. F. did at last “go for ” his monster.
All the men left the station, and Magindaus
insisted on the blacks camping in the house and
outbuildings and killing cattle whenever they felt
hungry. He made Beal eat all sorts of nigger’s
food, and stood over him with a nulla-nulla just
as Beal had stood over him with the revolver.
Finally, he insisted on his taking a gin to wife and
living like the other blacks.
Magindaus came over to my place once, but I
put the contents of a wire-cartridge into his
hinder hide and he retired. Then we held a con-
sultation as to the best course of action, for the
affair was becoming a public scandal. Two of us
being J.’sP. we issued a warrant against Magin-
daus and determined to ride over in a body and
order him to disperse in the Queen’s name. If he
refused we would capture him alive—or dead.
Magindaus was amusing himself with poor Beal
when we arrived there, and, when told to dis-
perse, commenced to use very bad language. Our
'measures were taken, however. Deaf Dick flung
a catching-rope neatly over his head, and Red Bob
■followed suit with another. Then we proceeded
to choke him down like a colt. But we made a
mistake, for Magindaus was not built like a colt,
and by the time we had him choked dowhi and
tied up Magindaus was dead.
We all looked rather foolish, and Beal, who had
grown quite imbecile, began crying grievously.
Whilst still gazing stupidly at each other I heard
a voice say :
■‘Now, bananas and fish, supplemented by a
generous meat diet, would alter the type in less
than two generations.”
Thank Heaven ! we were sitting on the veran-
dah, and Beal had sent me to sleep with one of
his long-winded speeches. .
“Do you intend to try the experiment I i
tasked*
“ I am thinking of it,” he answered.
“ Then take my advice and don’t, for I ve just
had such an awful dream.”
“ The devil you have ! Then we had better go
to bed.”
He has been very cool ever since.
FELIX SLOWBOY.
“The working-class that species of
slavery softened by a salary.”—Lamartine.
The late Lady Brassey used to carry a
marble figure of her dead child around the world
with her. There was always an eerie, peculiar
look in the unfortunate lady’s eye.
Kanakas, says Griffith, are imported for
cane-cultivation so that the poor white man may
get work. Api'opos, four able-bodied whites
lately took a contract to load cane for Bingera
(Bundaberg) Mill, on the cane-tramway at 6d. per
ton! They worked from sun-up till dark for 28
days, and earned £5 2s. 6d. —.£1 ss. 7id. per man.
And yet these ungrateful ruffians refused, after-
wards, to fall dense scrub, at =£l an acre, telling
the land-owner they were poor men enough, but
they wouldn’t like to rob him.
A Bundaberg (Q.) planter has been fined
<£2 for “ permitting ” a Kanaka to work inside a
sugar-mill. And this forty-shilling Nemesis is
duly telegraphed all over Australia to show people
how rigidly the Queensland Government carries
out its promises not to allow the nigger to do
work other than that for which he was imported.
But anyone who has lived on or near a Queensland
sugar plantation knows how the planter can
arrange such matters. The sugar-boilers and
engineers employed don’t care a rap if the entire
mill is run with Kanakas, provided that their
billets are not infringed upon, and even had they
the inclination to kick against rubbing shoulders
with a nigger they dare not do so. And as the
prosperity of small places like Bundaberg depends
upon the local sugar-mills no one but a rank out-
sider — an d these are kept at a distance during the
crushing season—would think of protesting, even
if he saw Kanaka sugar-boilers, engineers and
book-keepers. And so the planter feels secure,
and while Santo Jimmy, at 3s. a week, is plant-
ing the vegetables, Paddy from Tanna is making
bottle pap in the kitchen for the planter’s baby
who is out in his perambulator with another
nigger; meanwhile the planter’s wife is cursing
the stupidity of the ebon-coloured wench from
Malacca, who doesn’t all at once grasp the
intricacies of the family sewing-machine.

Pure blood is a life-long delight. It is health—real good health and
strength—free from pimples, spots, sores and aches.
Have pure blood by taking Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally, and use
a really good modern soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap—externally, and you
ensure a clear skin and a good complexion.
It is a mistake to suppose that a good skin or a clear complexion can be
secured by Soap alone. It cannot. A pure Soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap
is an invaluable aid to personal beauty, but the first essential is pure blood.
This must never be forgotten. If we can’t have the blood quite pure, then
we must get it as pure as we ean.
A man wants a clear skin and a wholesome complexion, in profession or
business. Else if he be blotchy, pimply, on disfigured, other men fight shy
of dealing with him. Let the man take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally
and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally,
A woman needs a good complexion else her happiness is decreased, and
her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer’s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A child for its health’s sake needs a rosy skin, free from eruptive
blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Lei
the child take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphui
Soap externally.
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets used internally ensures good blood—pure blood
that holds disease at bay and gives health.
Frazer’s Sulphur Soap renders the skin soft, supple and smooth, neither
drying the oils of the skin, nor shrivelling the nails, nor splitting the hairs.
It is a milled soap, contains extra balm, and is free from excess of alkali or
fat. It is simple and truly the best of all Soaps, and contains Oil of
Eucalyptus.

Tliis eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
n the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a life- time to the study of
Hervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources an 1
insidious disseminatidn, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi i
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

A Leg-Iron Song.
“The Dignity of Labour in Australia! Sleath and Fer-
guson and others, the cockatoo-jury-convicted Barrier
strike-leaders, shaved aud-oiopped and broad-arrowed and
leg-ironed and chained together two-and-two, have been
exhibited by the authorities on a railway-platform, on
route to their respective prisons.”
Rejoice, O Southern Nation, in darkness wandering
long !
Great Pluto reigns triumphant, and Might is
“ mighty strong ”;
To-day the glorious birthright our convict fathers
gave
Enthrones the God of Mammon and chains the
Barrier slave.
Clink, clink, clink.
The wild winds tell the story as they sweep round
Botany Bay,
It cometh from the Barrier, it’s cabled far away ;
The old Blue Mountain echoes send it on-towards
the sea,
And the tempests shriek in chorus the “Anthem
of the Free.”
Clink, clink, clink.
For this the God of Nature made Australia’s
' virgin soil,
For this we’ve fertilised it with tears and blood
and toil,
For this old Abel Tasman spread his white sails to
the breeze
That bore Australia’s Argonauts across the un-
known seas.
Clink, clink, clink.
The winds will tell the story, and the waves upon
the shore,,
For this Eureka miners dyed the great Stockade
with gore ;
For this the lips of brave old Lang hissed forth
the words of ii-e,
Till every burning sentence seemed writ in lines
of fire.
Clink, clink, clink,
O, the cash that’s spent on “ Government ” has
not been spent in vain,
For Shylock skins the people still with rack and
scourge and chain ;
Then swell the note of triumph till the wide world
hears afar —
“Three cheers for iron-fetters—for Might a wild
hurrah,”
Clink, clink, clink.
Under-Secretary Johnson, speaking at a
N.S. W. public school concert, said he once in-
spected a N.S. W. school where pigs congregated
under the floor, and interlarded his remarks with
approving grunts. The pigs stood it well till ho
reached “Object Lesson—Pigs,” when they re-
fused to hear themselves maligned and departed.
Tito Warnuvee (Melbourne) Club for
Women has been formally opened. “The Coun-
tess” was asked to “drink the first cup of tea,”
“ breathe the first slander,” or do whatever is the
equivalent for “turning the key,” “laying the
foundation-stone,” “ turning the first sod,” &c.,
but she declined, because some persons ”
expressed the vulgar desire to get a democrats
woman to do the job. The consequence was there
was no ceremony to speak of. There are about
351) members now, and the club is so far a success.
The “ladies” who at first seceded because the
members were called “ women ” have returned and
threaten to take charge of the club—which, by the
way, professes to exist in part to aid in the amelio-
ration of woman's lot. Yet it holds a sister in a
state of slavery for 12 hours a day. Its rnaid-of-
all-work, so says a correspondent, gets 15s. a week,
has to work on Sunday, and when she “asked
off” on Christmas Day, was growled at and
refused.
* G. R. Sims on the travelling Yankee :
There was another gentleman in the carriage who also
interested hie greatly. He was dark and dressed with
elaborate care, and he kept on producing instruments of
a remarkable character from his pockets. He was a man
who was evidently thoroughly equipped for all the con-
tingencies of everyday life. A blue bottle got into our
carriage, and he produced a fly-paper, on which it
promptly settled and died. He wanted to smoke,
and he took out a pipe with 17 distinct and separate
patents in it. Ho filled it from a pouch which
was absolutely remarkable for its ingenuity. He put
the tobacco in with a patent spoon, he rammed
it down with a metal stopper, then he put a skewer,
which he wore attached to a silver chain, up the stem,
then he slabbed the tobacco with a stiletto to make the
pipe draw more easily, and then he kindled a light by
means of an elaborate arrangement in six compartments,
which took about fifteen minutes to fit together. After
that he hung his hat up by a patent hat-suspender, put
on his gloves with a button-hook, squirted himself all
over with a scent spray, cut his newspaper with a paper-
cutter that was also a railway-key and a boot-jack, and
wrapped himself up in a patent rug which, by pulling
various strings, could be made into an overcoat, a mac-
intosh, a bed-quilt, a life-belt, a tablecloth and a shroud.
Finally, he went to sleep, after setting a pocket-alarm to
wake him up in an hour, and putting a patent catch on
his watch-chain, in case either of us should be taken
suddenly with kleptomania.
Editor Bulletin, — Me a par. of yours,
that a Maoriland man, just before the last elec-
tion in ’OO, paid £lOOO for one .£lO share in a
Christchurch (M.L.) paper, If the Conservative
one is meant there is a mistake somewhere. I
send you share-list of company-owners. You will
see by it that the nominal capital of the paper is
£OO,OOO divided into IfiOO deferred shares of £25
each, and 800 preferential shares of £25 each.
Shares not yet subscribed for, £7380. Of the
subscribed shares, the Landocracy own £34,500
worth. Law, £lO,OOO. This ought to be sufficient
to give the paper a decided tone in favour of land
monopoly and class legislation. To give it,
well, a sort of justice, it prints the same old
bunkum about the dangers of class legisla-
tion, “confidence is being destroyed,” “the
wage-fund is in danger,” “ progressive taxa-
tion is robbery,” &c., &c. One can read that
sort of article with his eyes shut. This paper, the
exponent of individual freedom and liberty, to be
consistent, has actually increased the tradediscounb
to 50 per cent. Thus is an eight-page newspaper
sold to the trade for a half-penny ! Not content
with this bait, it has also increased its Saturday’s
edition to twelve pages—and all for the same
price. The effect of this cut-throat competition
is to push its opponent, the Liberal paper, very
hard, and I have no doubt plenty of workingmen,
small farmers, and tradesmen, applaud such efforts
to give them good value for their pennies. As you
say, these people put their “pennies in the daily
paper slot ” and the returns are, “ insults,
poison.”—Yours, obediently, Tk Weka, Canter-
bury (M.L.).

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWORTH FALLS.
rpms MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10£ Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
The Madeira of the Bine Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the 'mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.:
The waralah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
'Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau !
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls - far and away
superior to the land on the other sijje of the line. The
picturesque views and’ the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seemsto have intended it.
ifW” Early Buyers will do well to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers.- For lithos., and all
