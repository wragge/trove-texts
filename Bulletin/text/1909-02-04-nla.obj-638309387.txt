An Earlier Omar
The Khayyam habit has become a modern
vice ; it is as easy nowadays to Rubaiyat as
to split an infinitive ; but it is somewhat
depressing to learn that the disease first
appeared 40 years before Omar started to
Khayyam. The namfe of'the first patient
was Abu’l-Ala, the Syrian, who was born 44
years before Omar, the tent-maker. Abu’l-
Ala was a great poet, much reverenced
by a multitude of disciples at Baghdad, and
among his works were The Falling Spark of
Tinder and The Necessity of What is Un-
necessary—which sound decidedly Syrian.
From these works Henry Baerlein has com-
piled a remarkable “diwan,” or selection.
In his translation Baerlein has wisely dis-
carded the original quantitative metre, and
utilised a stanza similar to, though not the
same as, that immortalised by Fitzgerald.
And his selections disclose a poet of the
same stamp as Omar, often of the same
poetic merit. But before a final judgment
of the standing of Abu’l-Ala is possible it
will be necessary to have literal translations
of his works. Omar owed much to the trans-
fusion of his thought with that of Fitzgerald
—as we know it, the Rubaiyat is really a
collaboration between the poet and the trans-
lator ; and it may be that Henry Baerlein
has done for his pet poet what Fitzgerald did
for his. But that larger work is promised
by Baerlein, together with a full account
of the life of the Syrian. Meantime we are
thankful for what we have got in this little
book, The Diwan of Abu’l-Ala, in “The
Wisdom of the East” series, published by
Murray at Is.
For this, however much it owes to the
creator or to the translator, is true poetry,
and for true poetry we are too grateful to
pry into origins. Abu’l-Ala’s poem in places
anticipates, and with the same poetic
thought, the wrnrk of Omar. Hear his
delicious raillery at religion :
Do !> there are many ways and many traps
And many guides, and which of them is lord ?
For verily Mahomet has the sword,
And he may have the truth—perhaps ! perhaps 1
Now this religion happens to prevail
Until by that one it is overthrown—
Because men dare not live with men alone,
But always with another fairy-tale.
Religion is a charming girl, I say ;
But over this poor threshold will not pass,
Because I can’t unveil her, and alas !
The bridal gift I cfin’t afford to pay.
\V
He has, too, the same philosophy, or,
rather, since Omar came after Abu’l-Ala,
the tent-maker but gives another and
equally poetic rendering of his predecessor’s
philosophic doubt.
Have conversation with the wind that goes
Bearing a pack of loveliness and pain :
The golden exultation of the grain,
And the last, sacred whisper of the rose,
But if in some enchanted garden bloom
The rose imperial that will not fade.
Ah ! shall I go with desecrating spade,
And underneath her glories build a tomb ?
Shall I that am as dust upon the plain
Think with unloosened hurricanes to fight?
Or shall I that was ravished from the night
Fall on the bosom of the night again?
T?et if all things that vanish in their noon
Are but the part of some eternal scheme,
Of what the nightingale may chance to dream,
Or what the lotus murmurs to the moon !
Have I not heard sagacious ones repeat
An irresistibly grim argument:
That we for all our blustering content
Are as the silent shadows at our feet.
No Sultan at his pleasure shall erect
A dwelling less obedient to decay
Than I, to whom all mysteries obey.
Build with the twilight for an architect.
Our fortune is, like mariners, to float
Amid the perils of dim waterways ;
Shall then our seamanship have aught of praise
If the great anchor drags behind the boat?
My faith it is that all the wanton pack
Of living shall be—hush, poor heart!—with-
drawn,
As even to the camel comes a dawn
Without a burden for his wounded back.
Some yellow sand all hunger shall assuage,
And for my thirst no cloud have need to roll,
And ah ! the drooping bird, which is my soul,
No longer shall be prisoned in a cage.
One is behind the draperies of life,
One who will tear these tanglements away—
No dark assassin, for the dawn of day
Leaps out, as leapeth laughter, from the knife.
He was the glazier out of Erzeflm,
Whose wizardry would make the children cry—
There will be no such wizardry when I
Am broken by the chariot-wheel’s of Doom.
The chariot-wheels of Doom ! Now, hear them roll
Across the .desert and the noisy mart,
Across the silent places of your heart—
Smile on the driver you will not cajole.
Live well ! Be wary of this life, I say ;
Do not o’erload yourself with righteousness.
Behold ! the sword we polish in excess,
We gradually polish it away.
But for the grandest flame our God prepares
The breast of man, which is the grandest urn;
Yet is that flame so powerless to burn
Those butterflies, the swarm of little cares.
W
And Abu’l-Ala has other facets than those
of his follower. There is, for instance, his
charming fable of the fattened worms in
“the silent chamber of the rose ” ; and here
are two stanzas that express an old thought
with a marvellous precision :
The songs we fashion from our new delight
Are echoes. When the first of men sang out
He shuddered, hearing not alone the shout
Of hills, but of the peoples of the night.
And all the marvels that our eyes behold
Are pictures. There has happened some event
For each of them, and this they represent—
Our lives are like a tale that has been told.
Finally, these striking stanzas, selected
out of many, need no comment :
There is a palace, and the ruined wall
Divides the sand, a very home of tears,
Arid where love whispered of a thousand years
The silken-footed caterpillars crawl.
I think our world is not a place of rest,
But where a man many take his little ease,
Until the landlord, whom he never sees,
Gives that apartment to another guest.
Say that you come to life as ’twere a feast,
Prepared to pay whatever is the bill
Of death or tears —surely, my friend, you will
Not shrink at death, which is among the least?
God pities him who pities. Ah, pursue
No longer now the children of the wood ;
Or have you not, poor huntsman, understood
That somebody is overtaking you ?
Now fear the rose ! You travel to the gloom
Of which the roses sing and sing so fair.
And, but for them, you’d have a certain share
In life : your name be read upon the tomb.
No sword will summon Death, and he will stay
For neither■■helm nor shield his falling rod.
We are the crooked alphabet of God,
And He will read us ere He wipes away.
How strange that we, perambulating dust,
■ Should be the vessels of eternal fire,
That such unfading passion for desire
Should be within our fading bodies thrust.
The shadows come, and they will come to bless
Their brother and his dwelling and his fame,
When I shall soil no more with any blame
Or any praise the silence I possess.
Enough has been given to prove that in
this Diwan there are pearls that are worth
the finding, pearls'for whose setting we thank
Henry Baerlein. No. lover of poetry, no
person who has delighted in Omar, can
afford to overlook this cheap and remark-
able book.
The American Wife
The American Woman is beginning to get
on the nerves of the American novelist.
Surfeited with the frontispiece woman of the
“ best-sellers,” he has turned to analyse the
other kind—the selfish, sexless, useless wife
of the rich. So in Together (Macmillan, New
York) Robert Herrick laboriously, and a
little dully, discloses the canker of heartless-
ness at the heart of the modern American
marriage. His book is large and leisurely
and inchoate—which, after all, is what Life
is. He takes a parcel of American wives
and deals with them with a detail that is
often tiresome ; but out of his novel emerges
an indictment against the American woman,
with a hint of the way for her reform. These
wives, all except one, vaguely yearn for a
“large, full life” (which usually has The
Other Man specified in it); and this large,
full life is hot filled up with children.
And the one exception fills her life with
nothing but love—and babies ; and grows fat.
When Isabelle learns that a child is coming
“she was conscious that she was made for
much more, for her own joy and her own
activity, and she hated to part with even a
little of it.”
The trouble is that in America the line is
drawn so sharply between a man’s work and
his wife’s play.
“I see you women all at play, and I see
the men only when they are wearily watch-
ing you play or playing with you. One hears
so much about business in America. But
with you people it is as much suppressed as
if your husbands or brothers went off to some
other star -every day to do their work, and
came back at night by airships to see their
families. ”
The American wife cannot complain that
in this book she is overlooked. She comes
in for criticism of the sharpest kind, not only
by the author, but by his characters. Says
one shrewd speaker :
“ Do you know what ybu are, women like
you, who have money and freedom to ‘live
your own lives ’ ? You are sexless ; you
haven’t nature’s great apology for the animal
—desire. Such women sin, when they sin,
with their minds. . . . You make marriage a
sort of intelligent and intellectual prosti-
tution—and you develop divorce. ... And
man, what of him ? You leave him to his
too gross temptations —Power and Lust.
Man is given you to protect, and you drive
him into the market-place, where he fights
for your ease, and then relaxes in the refined
sensualities you offer him as the reward for
his toil. . . . They cannot travel apart ; they
must pull together.”
\t>
And Herrick, in a summing-up chapter,
paints this unpleasant, yet quite possible,
picture :
“ In the marriage state, the union of Men
and Women is based on effort in common,
together ; not on sentiment, not on emo-
tion, not on passion, not on individual grati-
fication of sense or soul. The two are
partners in living, and the fruit of their
bodies is but another proof of their partner-
ship. And now .. . Woman, no longer the
Pioneer, no longer the defender of the house,
no longer the economist, blossoms—as what l
The Spender! The Man has the money,
and the Woman has—herself, her body and
her charm. She traffics with man for what
he will give, and she pays with her soul. . . .
She has found something softer than labor
with her hands, easier than the pains of
childbirth —she has found the secret of rule
—mastery over her former master, the slave
ruling her lord. Like the last wife of the
barbarian king, she is heaped with jewels
and served with fine wines and foods, and
lives in a palace—the favorite. .. . Small
comradeship here ! Marriage to this woman
is a state of personal gratification—the best
bargain she can make with mail. . . .
“ And thus, unwittingly, Woman becomes
again in the revolution of the ages what she
was at first, the female creature, the thing
for lust and amusement, —the cherished
slave. Woman in America, splendidly
free and Queen ! What have you done with
the men given into your charge ? Clever,
brilliant, beautiful, —our most shining prize,
—but what have you done for the souls of
the men given into your keeping ? The
answer roars up from the city streets, —the
most material age and the most material
men and the least lovely civilisation on God’s
earth. No longer the fighting compahion at
man’s side, but reaching out for yourselves,
after your own desires, you have become the
slave of the Brute as you were before. And
a neurotic slave. For when Woman is no
longer comrade of man in the struggle, she
is either Nothing or a—but blot the word !
... In the dumb animal hordes, >vho labor
and breed children, lies the future. For
theirs will be the land, when the blond hunter
of the market and his pampered female are
swept into the dust-heap.”
And the remedy for the American woman,
as Herrick shows, is the old and well-tried
remedy of Work—hard Work.
13 Interesting
A Neu) System of English Grammar is the
forgotten work by a forgotten American
humorist named Captain Derby, which Prof.
Lounsbury (whose work, The Standard of
Usage in English, was recently commented
upon in this page) has happily recalled to
the readers of Harper's. Captain Derby was
worried by the fact that, the English
language does not enable a man to tell the
exact truth. The adjective suffers from a
painful lack of precision. We have in that
only three degrees of comparison. But it is
evident that this limited number does
not suffice to represent adequately the
many essential differences in the article
described. Still less can three degrees
of comparison express the varying shades
of feeling about those objects that exist in
the mind of the speaker. Also, an
adjective will convey to one man
ideas dissimilar to those that the same
tired adjective will convey to another.
Really, for exact terminology, the language
is in a shocking state of disrepair. (The
cause of this, as has been pointed out in a
Bulletin editorial, is that the language is a
creation of Private Enterprise.)
v!/
For example, you speak of a girl as beauti-
ful, or very beautiful, or perfectly beautiful.
Now, I have lievqr seen the girl you
speak of; I have seen several beautiful
girls, but I have never found any two of
them equally beautiful. So I really can
have only the vaguest, and not a qualitative,
idea of your girl. Which is annoying to a
strictly mathematical mind. This defect,
inherent in all languages, Captain Derby
proposed to remedy by having all descrip-
tions and epithets marked on a sufficient scale
of comparison. Instead of only three degrees
of comparison, good, better, best (in Aus-
tralia, four: good, better, best, and boshter),
we might take a hundred. The lowest
conceivable amount of any human quality
consistent with its being at all would be in-
dicated by one. Its maximum would be
represented by one hundred. Within this
scale we have a wide range for all shades of
meaning of any given adjective.
‘‘ By prefixing to each epithet a figure
between one and one hundred, the precise
truth in regard to it, as it appears to him
uttering it, would be conveyed to him hear-
ing it. For example, you are askpd about
your health. Instead of replying pretty
well, tolerably well, very well, or some other
ambiguous expression, you would say, bear-
ing in mind that 100 indicates perfect health,
‘I am 15, or 50, or 75, or 90 well.’ By this
means the inquirer learns definitely what he
wants to know. . . The moment this method
of expression comes into general use, we
shall become exact, mathematical, truth-
telling, in the highest degree.”
Lounsbury gives from the defunct humorist
the following example of his method :
“On a 76 fine morning I was 55 slowly
walking down the 33 clean street, when I
chanced to meet the 22 young and 85 charm-
ing Miss Smith. We at once exchanged the
91 usual meteorological observations. ‘lt is
a 76 beautiful day,’ I remarked. ‘lndeed,
it is a 95 beautiful day, ’ she replied, f and I
am 97 glad to meet you, for it is a 99 long
time since I have seen you.’ I felt 77 flat-
tered by words like these coming from a 79
lovely girl, and proceeded to make the 71
usual inquiries about her health. She told
me that it had been 78 poor, but she was
100 glad to say that it was now 87 good.”
It will be noted that this method not only
imparts the facts of the case, but lets
us into the exact thoughts of the two
speakers. It will be observed, too, how this
method brings out the feminine addiction to
superlatives. And from this very fact the
device is sure to fail. Every woman who
uses it will be 100 sure to use the “100”
adjective every time ; and when a 78 loving
girl falls in love with the 81 average bloke
she will address him as the 101 dearest chap
in the world. Which is 32 illogical, and
therefore 99 feminine. So, 63 regretfully,
we must go back to our 81 meagre methods
of comparison. However, it may be 9 worth
while to try the method on the poets. The
poets are 66 vague. How 82 much more
exact is Keats when 100 logically inter-
preted !
64 deep in the 35 shady Sadness of a vale,
17 far sunken from the.4o healthy breath of morn,
83 far from the 77 fiery noon, and eve’s one star,
Sat 79 grey-hair’d Saturn, 42f quiet as a stone.
Pet-chance the 100 self-same song that found a path
Through the 81 sad heart of Ruth, when 92 sick
for home,
She stood id tears amid the 73 alien corn;
The 100 same that 22 oft-times hath
Charm’d 71 magic casements, opening in the foam
Of 69 perilous seas, in 95 faery lands 27 forlorn.
Now we know 100 exactly' what Keats
meant, or rather, what the present writer
thinks that 83 vague bard meant. It seems
a 69 great pity that Keats did not leave a
100 exact mathematic connotation of his 92
vague meaning.
_ * —__ ...
In his rather “precious” preface to
Laughter • and Tears, Frank Morton says some
hard things of Maoriland, the, dour casket
that perforce enshrines this pagan heart.
He terms it nicely, “ this strange land of
cherished solemnities and furtive joys.”
‘ ‘ When we banned Leighton’s ‘ Bath of
Psyche,’and Mr. Bernard Hall’s ‘Sleep,’ as
indecent pictures, we simply did it in order
that the world might be assured' that we
have a sense of humor. ... I expected much
when I came to this country ; but I cannot
yet persuade myself that I am in Arcady.
You Maorilanders have not the Australian’s
cordial spirit, his growing dislike of cant,
his bigness of grasp. You breathe less
deeply, and speak with a colder calculation.
You have fewer apparent vices, and fewer
positive virtues. . . . You are less lavish in
your hospitality, more bitter in your judg-
ments. YoUr indignation, aroused by
slighter causes, is more acrid and old-
womanish. Inde.ed, Maoriland is giving far
too much attention to the cult of the Old
Woman. For myself, I always regarded
your imitation rooster as a most ungainly
and indecent fowl. .. . To some extent,
your Worker’s Paradise is a fool’s paradise. . .
The widely advertised freedom of your in-
stitutions is somewhat of a forced exotic;
for there can be no real freedom in a com-
munity of which the units are not free.
Here and there about this country there is
a growth of bad weeds-—intolerance, espion-
age, black suspicion.”

An Overtaxed System
Extreme Nervousness Completely Cured.
An epoch-making achievement is here dealt
with by Mr. Michael Somers, of 47 Camden
Street, Newtown, who speaks of final success
being inevitable in similar cases if like measures
are adopted, ills narrative takes the following
form :
“ I was sitting down writing a letter one day
in Brisbane, feeling as well as a man could wish to
be, when I suddenly was seized with a dreadful
sensation, and collapsed. Previous to this I had
been leading a very strenuous life, working at top
pressure, and, presumably, I had overdone it.
The strongest systems will break down when
taxed too much, as I have learned to my cost.”
“What happened,” asked our representative,
“ when you were thus attacked ? ”
“ The case looked to be such a serious one that
I was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, and
there I received the very best attention they
could devote to me. Medicine was ordered, and
everything done they could think of. In all my
travels, and 1 have journeyed about a good deal,
I have never met a similar case to my own. It
certainly puzzled the doctors at the institution,
for they could not make head nor tail of the cause
of my affliction.”
“Gan you describe to me the feelings you had,
Mr. Somers ? ”
“Constantly recurring feelings of faintness were
as ti’oublesome as anyth.ng—such horrible sensa-
tions as would make a man think he was going off
at any moment, and, besides, I was afflicted with
the most extreme nervousness it had ever been
my misfortune to come into contact with. When
everybody else was in bed, comfortably asleep,
was the time that my nerve troubles assumed the
greatest dimensions, and I would have given all I
possessed in the world to have been able to doze
off and get rid, for a while, of the harassing
thoughts that disturbed my mind. I could think
of nothing pleasant; every idea that came was
created in an atmosphere of adversity. I felt that
I was hemmed in by hardships and trials of all
kinds, and I think I was, too. Perhaps I was on
the point of falling asleep when, with a little
convulsive jump, I’d start up again. It was a
feeling as if my heart had momentarily stopped,
and there I’d be dreading the same thing
happening again, for fear of what might follow.
That’s the wretched way most nights went by, so
imagine my despondent, worn-out condition
during the day. Suffocating feelings badly affected
my chest, and with difficulty I succeeded in
getting my breath. Meanwhile, the sudde*
jumping sensations in the heart’s region con-
tinued, accompanied with a terrible faintness, which
made me often think that my time had come, and
that I surely was going to die. Sometimes a
feeling came as if I were actually dead in parts-r
a horrible kind of numbness, it was—in the
stomach, chin, and back of the neck, and again
and again I was seized with the terrible conviction
that I was going to drop dead. I was really
afraid to fall asleep in case one of these seizures
would come on, and I would never wake up again.
Oh ! how awful it was. The extreme weakness
and constant twitching of my nerves could not be
checked by anything the doctors prescribed for
me, and I had long since despaired of ever being
about in the world again, when I started, through
reading a testimonial in the paper, taking the
medicine called Clements Tonic.”
“‘ And can you conscientiously state that
Clements Tonic made you as sound as you are
now ? ” queried the writer, looking at Mr. Somers
in amazement.
“ I can, indeed ; though it may seem incredible ;
but my wife and son here can vouch for what I
say being the gospel truth. The symptoms I have
described did not leave me for a long, long time,
and then only through the wonderful agency of
Clements Tonic. That is the truth, as God is my
judge. It seems like a dream to look back upon
—the hospital, the doctors, the numerous medicines
that did not apply to me at all beneficially, the
fainting bouts, the feelings of paralysis in parts of
my body, the unhappy frame of mind 1 was in.
the sleepless nights, the twitching of my every
nerve, the awful heart affections, and the intense
feebleness withal—yes, it seems like a hideous
dream that has passed and gone, for which I have
nothing in the world to thank but Clements
Tonic; so please publish the facts as you like.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

Darius at the Door.
If you turn Time’s pages o’er,
You will hear their frantic roar—
You will hear the Wades of Sparta cursing Athens
bitterly ;
You will note the Theban’s scowl,
And likewise the Argive’s howl —
And Athens speaking bitterly to Corinth o’er the
sea ;
They were fools, those Greeks of old—
Filled with spite and malice cold,
So they raged and cursed and wrangled all along
their ancient shore ;
When at last the Persian came,
They were crippled, halt and lame—
They were weak, alas ! and weary when his Axe
Burst in the Door !
Yes, that fool State-Frighter crew
Knew not what nor which to do—
Athens wailed'for help from Sparta in those days
long dead and gone :
“Spartans, help us !” rang their cry,
“ Help us quickly or we. die ! ”
But alas ! They fought without them on the field
of Marathon !
Came no aid at Athens’ call,
So its legion, weak and small,
Faced alone the ranks of Asia in that hour of
conflict sore ;
There was not a friend around
For the city violet-crowned.
Envy scowled and malice mocked them when the
Foe was at the Door.
’Twas a swift courageous band
That preserved the Grecian land —
’Twas their strength and grit that snatched it
from the Asiatics’ sway ;
’Twas one city—only one,
That took down its ancient gun,
And the flood that surges southward in this later
fighting day :
Met the old Athenian tar,
While the wranglers lagged afar,
Whilst the Theban sat disgruntled Athens bled
in days of yore ;
Just one struggling State alone
Made the Brown Man grieve and moan r
And drove the hairy Persian and his Axe from
Europe’s Door. . i j
. f
Now, upon this country’s coast
The State-Frighters are a host,
Hear the Wades and Kidstons shouting at Aus-
tralia bitterly ;
See the Insects, how they scowl.
How they shriek “ Secesh ” and howl— |
But remember ancient Sparta cursing Athens o’er
the sea !
Like those foolish Greeks of old,
Our State-Frighters whine and scold —
Hear them bellow, rave and wrangle all along
Australia’s shore;
When at last the foernan comes
Will ye beat Australia’s drums —
Will he find ye squalling vainly when his Axe
Bursts in the Door ?

Maisie.
Maisie surfs and flirts with ns
Daily, save on Wednesdays,
Brown and slim and frivolous—
But she’s grave on Wednesdays ;
Grave and dressed and orthodox,
In tan shoes and cotton frocks ;
We are graceless vagabonds
Of the wave on Wednesdays.
Maisie’s lavish smiles are more
Fugitive on Wednesdays,
Rash caprices of the shore
We forgive on Wednesdays ;
Surf-wet, she nor cares nor knows
Who may count her naked toes,
But belief in fashion is
Positive on Wednesdays.
Sunbrowned Maisie uptown is
Smart enough on Weduesdays ;
Dines on dainty anchovies
And such stuff on Wednesdays ;
Though her soft skin, brown and salt
As the seaweed, hath no fault,
Maisie always carries her
Powder-puff on Wednesdays.
Maisie’s hat and skirt are de
Gustibus on Wednesdays,
Once uptown no thought does she
Waste on us on Wednesdays ;
Never did a two-piece suit
In the surf-line look so cute !
But ’tis unavailing to
Make a fuss on Wednesdays.
Uptown, groomed and glib of speech,
Lurks for Maisie, Wednesdays ;
Eyes that beckon on the beach
Seem too lazy, Wednesdays ;
Dazed admirers either hand
Watch her walk the Block and Strand ;
Sidelong glances, teasing looks,
Drive them crazy, Wednesdays.
Maisie, with her dear mamma,
Does the Block on Wednesdays;
In the surf she laughs—but ah,
Loves to mock on Wednesdays !
Maisie, with her ma and me,
Lunches at the A.B.C. —
Folly looks too good to live,
In a frock, on Wednesdays !

THE NEWEST IDEA OF A FEDERAL CITY.
The Sydney Telegraph cordially recommends a certain place near Canberra as a capital site on account of the excellent shooting and fishing to
be obtained there. Apparently the paper thinks that the wild animals will remain even after the city is built, and that the metropolis of
Australia will lead a sporting outdoor life like this.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND
OTHER LARGE MATTERS.
Australia i 8 a large country, though quite a
number of its inhabitants have hardly discovered
its existence yet, and regard it, in a vague sort of
way, as a suburb of Peckham Rye, England.
A vast number of small men infest this very
large country, and neither they nor their ideas fit
their surroundings. A general impression pre-
vails that Melbourne is at the south end of this
big continent, and that Sydney is half-way up the
side wall of it, and that Brisbane is away up
north near the roof, and that Adelaide is half-way
along the base-line. And out of this geographical
misconception arise State Frights, a small view
of things, a ridiculous inability to realise the size :
of the dangers ahead of us or the greatness of the
work to be done, an unduly limited idea of
the importance of our country, and a ridiculously
inflated conception of the importance of
people like Bent and Murray and Jacky
Evans and Wade and Kidston, who clatter
in a small way in a small corner of the
big country. So, by way of a text for this
homily, The Bulletin attaches three maps. The
first represents Australia and Tasmania as they
are. The second, which looks an almost imper-
ceptible fraction smaller, represents the Common-
wealth as it would be if Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Hobart, Launceston, Bendigo, Ballarat,
and most of N.S.W.’s and all Victoria’s and
Tasmania’s big provincial towns and 2| complete
States were cut out of it. The third, which
shows a rather more perceptible slice hacked off
the outline, explains what the Commonwealth
would still be if all Tasmania, Victoria, and the
habitable part of N.S.W., and the most fertile sec-
tion of S.A. and a bit of Queensland were cut out —
what it would be without Brisbane, Newcastle,
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Launces-
ton, and almost every other place that we hear of
in a frequent sort of way. The vanishment of all
these places seems to leave the Commonwealth
almost unimpaired in point of size. Yet
that insignificant-looking excision would cut
away almost the entire population ; it would shift
five State Premiers— Kidston, Wade, Murray,
Evans and Price —off the scene; it would prac-
tically hack away the whole State Frights move-
ment, and the State “ grievances,” and the papers
which support the movement and devise the
grievances; it would shift the Federal capital
question, and the row about the division of the
tariff revenue, and the Broken Hill lock-out, and
Tom Mann, and all manner of disturbances. Yet
with all these gone the Commonwealth would
still remain—just diminished enough to attract
attention. And if a fourth map were made, cut-
ting off Perth as well as all the other capitals,
still the Commonwealth would remain very little
impaired.
• • * *
It is because of Map 111. that The Bulletin
urges this community to take the Large Austra-
lian View of things. In the first place, it is on
that account that it urges the immediate
taking over of the Northern Territory, the build-
ing of the transcontinental railway by the shortest
possible route, and the establishment of a strenu-
ous Federal policy of immigration and land settle-
ment in the North. When one considers how
little difference the excision of all the imposing
distance from Melbourne to Brisbane makes upon
the stupendous aggregate distances of Australia,
it becomes possible to realise how very far off is our
neglected northern outpost, and how essential it
is to' garrison it with a strong, faithful white
population, and to place efficient sentinels there
No. I. —This is the
Commonwealth.
to keep an eye on the Beyond. Nothing that the
little concentrated patch of population in the
South-West could do under present circumstances
would serve to dislodge an enemy planted in the
empty North ; there must be a considerable armed
population on the spot, and a railway. Without
them an Asiatic enemy could land a whole series
of semi-military colonies there, and he could
build towns and erect fortifications, and lay out
farms, and then set himself to appease Britain and
secure its assent to his occupation with the promise
that the settlers would be loyal and obedient sub-
jects and good taxpayers. And as Britain owns the
Territory still —this fool country having so far
been too tired to take it over when offered—the
decision would rest wholly with Britain. In the
absence of white Australian settlers the law of
“effective occupation’’ is against us ; and in the
absence of a transcontinental railway, our little
army, taking feeble walking exercise at the
farthest end of the scheme of things, could do
nothing.
* • • *
It is also partly because of Map 111. that The
Bulletin has no connection whatsoever with the
State Frights push. There are other reasons, but
Map 111. is a reason in itself. The whole State
Frights movement can be cut out of the plan or
diagram of Australia and yet leave it looking very
little smaller than before. That movement
is merely the discordant barking of one
corner of the atlas —the small, half-built
Present baying at the illimitable Future.
And for the same reason The Bulletin is
emphatically opposed to the absurd demands of the
State Premiers as to the division of the tariff
revenue after the expiration of the Braddon
clause. William Ltne’s proposal that the Com-
monwealth should keep the whole tariff revenue,
and relieve the States of their debts—the offer
which the State Premiers rejected with scorn—
was in reality excessively liberal ; the State Pre-
miers’ idea that they should have the bulk of the
revenue for certain, and a mortgage on all the rest,
was insanely ridiculous. The Commonwealth
stands for most of that huge section of Australia
which remains on Map ill. For the safety of
Australia that great region requires railways,
towns, population, defence requires almost
everything that it hasn’t got. If it is to get these
things in any reasonable time the Australian
Government must take a hand, for the feeble, im-
pecunious little Governments at Brisbane, Perth,
and Adelaide, away in the South, can do
very little. Therefore, the Commonwealth wants
money—much money. There are other claims to
be considered besides those of the bit of Aus-
tralia which makes so little visible difference when
it is cut right off the map, though it makes so
No. II.—This is the Commonwealth as it would
be if Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Launceston,
Hobart, and a multitude of small towns and 2½
States were cut off. There is still a good deal left.
much noise that it is often mistaken for all Aus-
tralia—its Past and Present and Future, and the
entire show generally.
* * * *
Map 111. is an argument for many other things
as well. It represents the practically-unpopulated
Australia, while the little bit that is cut off repre-
sents the thinly-populated Australia. Thestupend-
ousarea expounds more eloquently than anything
else could the need for universal military training
and the insensate folly of those who oppose that
beneficent idea. Britain has already given us
abundant warning to provide for our own defence,
and when the men are so few and the square
miles so many—Britain’s whole army, even
if multiplied by ten, would only be a lost
circumstance in a corner of it—it is plain
that the only sane or sensible precaution we
can take is to train every man we have, and
thus make the best of a defence which, even at
the best, will be very poor. Further, the same
sketch of our continent shrieks aloud for a navy
of our own. Even to regular coastal travellers
the distance from Adelaide to Sydney seems a
very long stretch ; yet all that expanse of coast
can be cut out, and so much remains that the
excision makes but little difference. If a really
serviceable British squadron did come out here to
deal with an enemy, it might chase him vainly
round that stupendous coast-line for weeks, and
by that time, in all probability, the ordinary Euro-
pean complication would call it back to British
waters to help guarantee Bull’s own safety.
Only a squadron that could be relied upon to be
here, to stay here, and to look after the enemy to
the last, could provide for the safety of a country
which suffers from such an excess of the long wash
of Australasian seas.
* * * *
In addition to these things Map 111. represents
a voice crying in the wilderness for the policy of
the Unification and Reconstruction party. That
party urges a temporary unification —a temporary
handing over to the Australian Parliament of all
authority, all public services, all debts and assets
and sundries. Then it is to be the business of the
Parliament to reconstruct the country, dividing it
into smaller States, each with its own capital and
its own sane little Democratic Legislature of one
House, endowed with such powers and such assets
as it seems wise that the States should possess.
Australia requires subdivision and reconstruction
almost as badly as it requires population. The
cutting of a humble fragment off the south-east
corner of Australia’s page in the atlas obliterates
five out of the six State capitals, as well as the
proposed Federal capital site. If a line
were drawn from Brisbane to Perth it
would obliterate all the State capitals, and
yet - four-fifths, or possibly five-sixths, of
Australia would remain. There is a huddle of
capitals in the extreme south of Australia—in
fact, so closely are they huddled towards the
south coast that that line drawn from a little north
of Brisbane to a little north of Perth nearly falls
into the Southern Ocean at one part of its career.
And from these far south capitals the requirements
of the country further north are considered through
long-range telescopes till about the centre of
Australia is reached. Beyond that the curvature
of the earth makes it impossible to see anything.
A subdivision into comparatively small States,
each with its own State capital, would at least
give the places north of the big curve in the earth
a chance to receive some consideration. Further-
more, Map 111. is a whole essay on the need for a
vigorous white immigration policy. When it is
remembered that the cutting of a mere fragment
out of the outline of Australia leaves the gigantic
balance of a con tinen t with only aboulBoo,ooo people
in all its stupendous length and bread th, the demand
for the importation of the capable white stranger
becomes very evident. In fact, there is in that
little diagram of Australia the basis of a
complete, democratic, all-Australian policy. It
shows a little population brawling in a little corner
of a continent, and mistaking it for the whole
country. Down in that corner there is Australia’s
little network of railways, and its little State
Frights push, and its little capital site shindy, and
No. III.—This is the Commonwealth as it would
he if Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne,
Adelaide, Launceston, Hobart, and 52 out of
Australia’s 71 provincial towns of 3000 popula-
tion and upwards were cut out, along with two
whole States and portions of three more. The
great bulk of the Commonwealth yet remains.
there is also the little State to which a big hairy
man .with a little mind once proposed to annex
the name of the whole country. To be sure the
little corner is a big enough corner by comparison
with most European countries, but as compared
with Australia, which is very large, the corner is
wretchedly small. That is why Australia
requires men with large ideas. It is such a vast
country that a small idea gets lost in it like a germ
in a mammoth’s stomach.
AGAIN THE WARNING.
The amount of aid which Australia can expect from the
Motherland is necessarily limited, and Australia must be
largely dependent upon herself for defence.— Ex-Governor -
Oeneral Northcote.
If Australia’s day of trouble finds it unprepared
it certainly won’t be able to say that it didn’t get
abundant warning. The British Government and
the British press used to hint the news that this
country must not depend on Britain for defence.
Now it puts up eminent public men to yell the
information in Australia’s hairy and unheeding
ear. The other day it was ex-Prime Minister
Rosebery who told us clearly and emphatically
that Britain’s position is now such that the guard-
ing of its own isles against foreign aggression
has become a sufficient task to absorb the
Gold Country’s energies, and with that busi-
ness on hand nothing that could happen to
Australia would justify Britain in sending
away a fleet to this country’s assistance. This
time it is ex-Governor-General Northcote who
mentions that, so far as we are concerned, Britain
is a broken reed to depend upon, and that we
must look to our own defence. With warnings
like these coming so thick and fast from obviously
inspired sources, one might have expected to hear
that the Fisher Government had summoned Par-
liament together in haste, and that it proposed in
an emergency session to attempt to deal with
some at least of the five great questions which
bear upon defence—universal military training,
the construction of an Australian navy to be built
in Australian dockyards, the taking over of the
Northern Territory, the building of the two
transcontinental railways, and the peopling of
the empty North with white immigrants of our
own race. A country which has really no de-
fence of its own, which has less than two
people to the square mile wherewith to con-
struct a defence, and which has been told
on good authority that all its dreams of being
absolutely protected by the mother-land are mere
phantasies, and that it is little better than a
rioh hulk adrift on the political waters, and
waiting for the first pirate to come along and
take possession—a country in such a position
might be excused if it called an emergency session
of Parliament to consider things. But nothing of
the kind has happened. There hasn’t even been
a serious ripple on the surface of things. The
only emergency session was that of the Cricket
Board of Control.
* * W *
The dreadful party of which Willy Kelly,
M.H.R., is a representative, tries to believe that
Britain doesn’t mean what it says in this matter,
and that its great naval strength will assuredly
come to our assistance if an Asiatic or other
Power attacks us. Yet it is only necessary to con-
sider again the size of the probable enemy whose
existence ties Britain’s ships to its own shores in
order to realise the absurdity of the Willy Kelly
belief. Germany has nearly 50 per cent, more
people than Britain, and its population is increas-
ing fully twiceasquickly. Itsarmy is vastly stronger
than Britain’s, yet it costs hardly any more. Its
total revenues are more than twice as large as
Britain’s. The six Dreadnoughts which are to be
launched in 1911 (Britain only launches two that
year) are expected to give Germany an actual
preponderance in big new fighting ships. Ger-
many is believed to be already ahead of Britain in
manufactures certainly it now has double
Britain’s output of iron and steel. The two
greatest steamship lines in the world are both
German—the largest German steamship co. owns
more than twice the tonnage of the largest British
one. Germany has £633,000,000 in its savings
banks against Britain’s £204,000,000. And all these
points of superiority have been gained in twenty
years, under high Protection and a fairly sensible
land policy; if the progress continues, another
ten or twenty years should see amazing results.
In addition to everything else there is the feel-
ing that Germany’s turn is coming. Greece,
Turkey, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France,
Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Britain
—each one of them has had its hour as
a great conquering and colonising power, and
on the principle that every dog—especially every
large dog—gets its day, there is a prevalent senti-
ment that Germany’s day must be near. It
seems to be in the nature of things that it should.
And, if a fight comes, Britain must fight at a
serious disadvantage, for its almost complete de-
pendence on foreign countries for its food supplies
makes it necessary to defend, not only itself, but
the sea highways along which its victuals plod
wearily to the shores of Bull. In such circum-
stances it is a very sanguine person who is pre-
pared to rest on the theory that Britain doesn’t
mean what it says when it warns Australia to
make ready for its own defence.
■* * * •
The Anglo-Jap alliance expires in six years. It
is already known that there is little probability of
its renewal, and it may suffer breakage before
1915. If the amazing growth of Germany con-
tinues, John Bull, whose hands are already full
of trouble, is likely about 1915 to find them still
fuller, and to be even less able to aid us than
he is now. Japan is already doing things
which suggest a clearing of the way for
action. It has fixed up treaties with France,
Russia and the United States, and thus done all
that is possible to keep these nations quiet, and to
assure them that there is no need to maintain sea
armaments in the Pacific, which is becoming more
and more a Jap lake. This in itself is a powerful
hint to Australia—in fact, Australia is getting so
many hints, one way and another, that it
must depend on its own resources, and that it may
need these resources very soon —that its state of
somnolence is almost unbelievable. Of course,
there may, after all, be ?some assistance to be
obtained from outside in the day of trouble, but
the kind of assistance that seems most probable
would be almost as bad as none at all. Britain
may spare us 100,000 or 200,000 nigger troops from
India, and, if they secure us against conquest, it
is difficult to see how they can be prevented from
settling down in this country when their period of
service expires, should they feel that way inclined.
Britain brought a nigger army to Europe in 1878,
which is something in the way of a precedent.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A New Species of Gag.
A. N. Barnett, S.M., after committing T.
Mann and four others to take their trial on a
charge of rioting at Broken Hill, granted Mann
bail on condition that he took no further part in
the strike or lockout proceedings. Subsequently,
upon Mann refusing to tic himself down to any
such condition, the magistrate chopped the tail
off his remarkable dictum, and said that Mann
might spout if he wanted to so long as he didn’t
spout in N. S. Wales. The Bulletin probably puts
less value on Mann’s spouting than even A. N.
Barnett, S.M., does; it would silence him, if it
could, by the simple process of persuading the
workers to leave off listening to his long-winded
and impracticable and out-of-place foolishness.
But Barnett’s plan is full of danger. Mann’s
business is that of an organiser; rightly or
wrongly the men who boss the Broken Hill unions
think that he is a good organiser, and they have
hired him for that purpose. What Barnett,
S.M., decides is therefore that Mann shall not be
permitted to carry on his business. With Mann’s
lawful business asan organiser neither Barnett nor
the law is in the least degree concerned. In fact,
the case had hardly started before Barnett him-
self announced that he had nothing to do with a
strike or a lockout—all he had to do with was an
alleged riot. Yet though he held that he had got
nothing to do with a strike or a lockout while the
case was on, directly it was over he took the
opportunity of muzzling the strike leader. It
wasn’t merely a matter of binding him down
not to riot any more, assuming that he had
rioted once; that, in fact, might have been a
perfectly reasonable thing to do. The situation is
exactly the same as if an accountant, charged with
larceny which he denies, were granted bail on
condition that he didn’t do any more accounting ;
or as if a newspaper publisher, charged with a
libel which he repudiates, were granted bail on
condition that he left off publishing his paper
until after the trial. If it is possible for Mann to
be silenced in this way, it ought to be possible to
silence any newspaper or any politician during a
general election or any other crisis; and
that is not a power which ought to lie in
any magistrate’s hands. Whether Barnett
acted under instructions from, or after con-
sultation with, the Crown Law Office which
has C. G. Wade for its temporary head hasn’t
yet transpired; but as it is just the sort of
decision at which C. G. Wade would be likely to
arrive, somebody ought to take the earliest oppor-
tunity in Parliament to find out where the
responsibility lies. In any case,. whether Barnett
or Wade was responsible, Parliament ought to
make an opportunity to express its opinion on the
subject. And when the time comes, it is to be
hoped that it will forget that it was T. Mann who
was gagged, and will remember that next time,
on this precedent, it will probably be somebody
whom the country cannot so well afford to have
muzzled.


A Result of Abiding by the Law.
It seems to be the general conviction that one of
the most shocking miscarriages of justice which
N.S.W. has known in recent years occurred last
week, when Neil Hansen, master of the Dun-
more, had his certificate suspended for 12 months
by the N.S.W. Marine Court in connection with
the naval disaster that took place in Sydney har-
bor on January 5. There is no question about the
facts. The Dunmore was rounding Mrs. Mac-
quarie’s Chair on its proper course, en route to a
berth on the west side of Woolloomooloo Bay.
The naval launch, with a pinnace in tow, was
heading towards the Dunmore on its way to the
Man o’ War Steps. Now, Article 19 of the Regu-
lations says this:—
When two vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of
collision, the vessel which has the other on its own star-
board side shall keep out of the way of the other.
It was not disputed by anyone that the launch
had the Dunmore on its starboard bow. Article
21 lays down that—
Where one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the
OTHER SHALL KEEP ITS COURSE AND SPEED.
The Dunmore obeyed the law. It kept its course
and speed, assuming, as it had a right to assume,
that the on-coming launch would observe the rule
of the road and “keep out of the way.” The
launch didn’t. When almost under the big ship’s
bows it cut across to port, and the holocaust
began. It is assumed by a certain class of man on
the tram (and the Marine Court had seemingly a
vague idea to the same effect at the back of its
rather ancient head) that Hansen should have
had a divine inspiration to the effect that the
naval men meant to go fanti and cross him, and
that he should have ported his helm hard in con-
sequence. Failing a vehement message from
Above, it is the last thing a careful seaman who
knew his business would do. And even if he
obeyed a message from Heaven in this regard, he
would still be liable for breaking the law of
N.S.W. Marsden, commenting on Article 27,
uses these words of horse sense:—
A vessel is not justified in departing from the Regula-
tions because it fears that the other ship Will not comply
with them. In a case decided under the Trinity Rules of
1840 Dr. Lushington thus laid down the general principle :
“ I cannot conceive that anything would be more likely
to lead to mischievous consequences than to suppose that
a vessel whose duty it is to keep its course should antici-
pate that another vessel will not give way, and so give
way itself. The consequence would be that there would
be no certainty. The certainty which results from ad-
herence to general rules is, in my opinion, absolutely
essential to the safety of navigation,
Barrister Broomfield put the case for Hansen
thus succinctly and correctly :
What Hansen did was absolutely correct, and what he
was bound to do. The collision could have been avoided
at any time if the launch had ported its helm, which was
what it should have done. If the Dunmore had star-
boarded, and the launch had done what it should have
done, ported, and there was a collision, the master of the
Dunmore would have been solely to blame under the
Regulations, which set out that once a master saw on his
port side a vessel crossing his bows he was bound to keep
his course and speed. The other boat was entitled to
suppose he was going to keep his course and speed, and
entitled to shape its own course accordingly. In this case
the master of the Dunmore had done nothing negligently,
for what he did he would be bound to do again in similar
circumstances.
Judge Backhouse (President of the Marine Court)
went out of his way, at this stage, to say :
The launch could have cleared you any time he liked,
that is certain.
Yet a few minutes later this amazing Court was
employed taking away for a year the livelihood
of a man who was not aboard the guilty launch.
The sole reason given by the Marine Court for
condemning Hansen is contained in these words
of Judge Backhouse’s judgment
The Court is not able to understand how the collision
could have taken place if a proper lookout had been
kept on the Dunmore, and for that default the master’s
certificate has been suspended for the period named.
Yet two men belonging to the naval launch and
five men on board the Dunmore swore that the
mate —himself a certificated master —was keeping
a lookout on the forecastle head of the Dunmore
when the collision occurred. Hansen has
apparently been sacrificed to the bad old super-
stition that the British navy can never be wholly
in the wrong under any circumstances. It is the
only explanation of the wild travesty of justice
that has smitten that unlucky mariner. If the
judgment isn’t reversed by a higher Court,
N.S.W. will be advised to burn or dynamite its
text-books on maritime law, and stay ashore. For
the water within Mother’s jurisdiction will not be
a safe place for any man to adventure upon.

Some Animals and a Federal Capital.
The person who is searching Yassberra to see if it
has a Federal capital site concealed about it, has
dug up a splendid argument in favor of placing
the headquarters of a continent within that dis-
tressful area. The Sydney Telegraph correspond-
ent—who seems to have been at the capital site
detective’s elbow drew his attention to the
alleged ad vantages of something called the Warroo
site, and the lone searcher in the wilderness said
that it would be a fine place for the capital on
account of the fishing and shooting to be got
thereabouts. This is the result of sending a man
with a one-horse-power imagination on one of the
biggest quests in history—the selection of a
place which is to be for all time the head-
quarters of a whole continent. The indivi-
dual now adrift in the neighborhood of
Yass is perspiring under a misapprehension
and should be recalled. Australia doesn’t want a
good spot for a hunting lodge, or a tourists’ pre-
varication bureau, or even a blacks’ camp. The
amounts of rabbits, fish, white elephants, or
giraffes to be shot, hooked, snared, chloroformed,
or stunned thereabouts doesn’t count in this
matter. Even if they are there in shoals and
herds at the present time, they will avaunt to the
wilderness as soon as a big city starts to uprear
itself in their vicinity. Probably enough the site
of London was originally selected on account of
the splendid bear-hunting to be had in White-
chapel; if so, the Telegraph’s remarks only
tend to show that that paper is to-day in just
the same mental state as the early Briton was
over 2000 years ago. Anyhow the pioneers of the
Federal city aren’t going down there with rifles
and fishing lines. They are going with dynamos
and machinery, bricks, mortar, girders, railway
engines, typewriters, and the whole kit of civilisa-
tion. They have no delusion to the effect that,
because the kangaroo is there now, he will stop
there when all this machinery arrives, and breed
freely in the main street right in the middle of
the tram-line, and be available to be shot from the
windows of Parliament House. To drag a heap
of animals into the discussion of a subject of this
size indicates either colossal stupidity or a lack of
reverence that deserves to be sternly discouraged.

The Price of Tory Support.
The disastrous applause of the Tory press—that
applause which leadeth unto destruction —con-
tinues to fall heavily on the Fisher Government.
Minister Mahon purchased the oordial approval -
of the backwash papers when he did his remark-
able act of adulation to N.S.W. State Premier
Wade, and assured him that he represented a
State which stands for 37 per cent, of the Com-
monwealth’s population, and the Australian
Government can’t afford to ignore it. N.S. vN .
probably stands for 37 per cent, of the Australian
population, and for that reason it has 27 Represent-
atives and six Senators to look after its inter-
ests, and they see that it is not ignored, nor
has anyone ever attempted to ignore it.
Mahon’s statement was a gross insult-by-impli-
cation to the Australian Parliament, conveying, as
it did, the impression that though the otherbtates
were quite safe in the hands of their lederal
members, N.S.W. required the constant super-
vision qf State Premier Wade to save its
Federal interests; and when Mahon carried
his humble assurance to the feet of Wade,
who has nothing at all to do with the Federal
affairs of N.S.W., it was a foolish case of pan-
dering to the vanity of a bumptious and
interfering nuisance. Still it fetched trie
applause of the Tory and State Frights publica-
tions. So did Attorney-General Hughes’ needless
repudiation of the Unification and Reconstruc-
tion policy. And last week the Hebald greased
the Federal Labor party in a leading article for
its shameful reversal of attitude over the I ederal
capital question, and its complete surrender to
Wade and his Congested Population craze, and
assured it that it was a great and intelligent crowd
which (by climbing down) had solved a difficulty
that had defied all previous Australian Govern-
ments ; and then the Herald explained that the
Fisher Government could earn its further ap-
plause and support if it did another complete sur-
render to the State Frights crowd over the divi-
sion of the tariff revenue. AndtheFiSHEßMinistry
is getting so accustomed now to the applause of
the Tory press that this surrender, though
it may look impossible, doesn’t look so
impossible as it should do. The ques-
tion of the division of the surplus stands
to-day where it was left when the State Premiers
foolishly rejected William Lyne’s handsome
offer. After the end of next year the whole Cus-
toms and Excise revenue can be legally retained
by the Commonwealth. William Lyne pro-
posed that the States should receive a permanent
fixed subsidy equal to £7,000,000 a year to begin
with, and rising by instalments to nearly
£9,000,000 a year. This subsidy would about
equal what they have been receiving, but, instead
of being an uncertain thing, dependent on the
rise or fall of the tariff receipts —and just now
they are falling heavily—it would be definitely
guaranteed. The balance, whether large or
small, the Commonwealth was to retain. Now
the Commonwealth has (1) to pay old-age
pensions ; (2) to take over the Northern Territory,
open it up with roads, make the land available for
settlement, and bring in a vast number of
desirable white immigrants to populate it and
hold it against the Asiatic; (3) to pay interest
on the Territory’s debt; (4) to find £2,000,000
for postal and telegraph works ; (5) to build two
immense transcontinental railways ; (6) to provide
as best it can military and naval defence for a
country almost as large as all Europe ; (7) to create
a Federal capital and build a railway to connect
it with the coast. With these enormous responsi-
bilities ahead, Lyne’s offer to the States was
ridiculously lavish, yet the cantankerous State
Premiers threw it aside with scorn and rage.
Their demand was for something like £7,000,000
a year certain—this amount to be paid even
if the tariff didn’t yield £7,ooo,ooo—and for at
least half the remainder of the Customs and Excise
revenue. It was a deliberate attempt to cripple
and beggar the Commonwealth, and if the State
Premiers’ scheme were adopted, the Northern
Territory, the transcontinental railways, postal
and telegraph extension and defence would
have to go overboard in one disastrous
act. Now the Herald hints broadly that this
wholesale surrender is the price at which the Tory
press will give further support to the Fisher
Government. The surrender of the interests of
Australia over the Federal capital matter got it
enough Tory support to carry it into recess, and
getting there meant several months’ assurance of
office. Another and a bigger surrender, it appears,
might so far purchase the forbearance of Toryism
as to enable the Fisher Ministry to get along as
far as the General Election. The Tory press puts
the price of its support pretty high.

The State to the Rescue.
Anti-Sosh rose up and rent its frock-coat, figur-
atively speaking, and jumped on its plug hat in
agony when the Fisher Government’s Common-
wealth horse-breeding proposals were made clear to
it last week :
T. I. Campbell, secretary of the Farmers’ and
Settlers’ Association, urged that the breeding of
military horseflesh should be left to Private En-
terprise. He told the papers that he could not con-
ceive that the Government would adopt any such
scheme as a Commonwealth Horse-breeding Farm
“ unless,” said he in a jocular way, “ they want to make
use of the Federal capital site.” He could not see how it
would b ' possible for a Government to undertake horse-
breeding. It was not a system that could be followed with
any degree of certainty. It might happen that the breeds
would be altogether unsuitable for Government require-
ments. Fifty machines might be made alike, but there
could be no 50 horses bred alike.
Which is tragic rot of the most flaming variety.
The Russian and Austrian Governments have
been breeding horses for military purposes,
with success, for years. The Russian Govern-
ment gave British racing-owner J. Gubbins
£30,000 for Galtee More (winner of the ’97 Derby)
with the object of breeding from that fine
horse. The Argentine Government bought Orme,
and the French Government Flying Fox, for the
same purpose. As to the wild allegation that
horse-breeding is “ not a system that can be fol-
lowed with any degree of certainty,” it may be
said that the knowledgable breeder’s power to get
an unlimited humber of horses so near to type as
not to matter is a scientific, social, and every other
sort of truism. A good example in point is the
American trotting-horse. The trotter has evolved
from the Mambrino stallion Messenger in a little
over a century. In conformation and paces
this horse is sui generis. So with the Eng-
lish thoroughbred hackney, the polo pony,
the Clydesdale, and the Irish hunter. The
Commonwealth horse-breeding proposals are
the direct result of Private Enterprise’s
ghastly failure of late years to produce a
fair-class weight-carrying charger at anything
like a reasonable price. The horse has been
treated in most of the States with the lavish in-
difference that a State Premier accords to loan
moneys. In N.S.W. things have reached such a
pass that shopkeepers have to lend or hire their
van horses to the local cavalrymen on parade days.
If they didn’t oblige in this way Ma’s cavalry de-
fenders would have to go on parade aboard tri-
cycles or on foot. It was said by the morning
papers of acrack Light Horse regiment which came
from the back blocks to camp at Liverpool six
months ago that “not one unit in ten was decently
mounted. The cause of this state of things in a
country whose “ general utility ” horses were once
world-famed is a matter of notoriety among horsey
men. The S’African war denuded Australia of a big
proportion of its remounts. The Russ-Jap disturb-
ance denuded itsomemore. And eversince a steady
stream of high-class cavalry and mounted infantry
stock, in addition to blood sires and dams, has
been flowing Asiawards and to the Philippines.
Private Enterprise on this side has assisted the
movement with all its might. It has welcomed
the Jap and other foreign horse-buyers with warm
hand-grips and iced drinks. For ten years or
more individualism has done magnificently out of
its horse deals. Now the aftermath is at hand.
The jamboree is coming to an end. The country’s
equine capital is about exhausted. The big
stations are overrun with “weeds” —the rejected
of the oversea veterinary experts —and the progeny
thereof. There is no reason to assume that the
Government is going to administer its horse-breed-
ing establishment one whit less satisfactorily than
it administers the trams, the railways, the gaols,
the asylums, and the various other Socialistic
concerns under its control. The production of an
unfailing stream, year by year, of sound weight-
carrying horses for home use is an affair of national
urgency. Private Enterprise has tried its hand
at the job and made a failure of it, mainly because
its greed of present gain has led it to trade off the
stock that should have been retained for breeding
purposes. In a manner of speaking, it has sold
the horse that laid the golden foal. It is the
State’s bounden duty to step in and rectify
matters.
Too Sane To Be True.
At Clontarf (9/11/’08) Bill Wilks, Freetectionist
and Orangeman, said this :
But to-day we have something else to do than look back
at the Battle of the Boyne. We have to start a battle of
our own. The great crowd in front of me is crammed
with a great sentiment, which is only waiting an oppor-
tunity to burst all bonds. . . . Orangemen do not come
together merely to show their gratification over victories
earned 200 years ago. I believe they have been waiting
for some prominent, courageous statement from their
grand-masters. If something is not done within the next
two months I am a most disappointed man.
It was William’s Tom MANN-like way of fore-
shadowing a change in the Yellow Pup’s political
attitude. The two months have elapsed, the
Orange battle-programme has been drawn up, and
at Clifton Gardens (23/l/’O9) Parson Dill Macky
read it out to the company assembled. Consider
it:—
(1) So far, and just so far, as Continental Socialism
denies religion and works for atheism —Anti-Socialism.
(2) To return to the worker as nearly as may be the full
product of his labor.
These two are the main principles on which the planks
rest. Two minor principles are :
(3) For defence on land—an army raised in Australia ;
the effective training of Australians to defend themselves
if necessary.
[lt is understood, remarks S. M. Hbrald (25/l/’O9)
apropos principle No. 3, that there is a section of the
Orange authorities which holds that the only training
which can be effective is compulsory.]
(4) For defence on sea—a subsidy to the Royal Navy.
Eliminate the subsidy foolishness, and the pro-
gramme looks promising, though vague. Prin-
ciple 1 means nothing if it doesn’t mean that the
DILL-ites propose to adopt the Labor attitude
towards industrial matters in its entirety. ‘ ‘ Con-
tinental” Sosh, the “denial of religion,” and
“ works ” on behalf of “ Atheism,” are things no
sane Laborite in this country bothers his head
about. Principle 2is a further affirmation of the
desirability of the policy G. Reid and the Watch-
man held to be Anarchy in 1906. Principle 3is
cheeringly sane and patriotic, issuing from the
anti-Australian source it does. The doubtful
question is—how much of the programme is likely
to be honestly striven for by its authors when the
elections come again ? Hitherto the party has bar-
racked with misguided fervor for the cause of the
well-to-do importer, of the hoggish land-mono-
polist, and of the opulent absentee person. It
hasn’t worried about the fact that 90 per
cent, of its members, sympathisers and potential
sympathisers are of the poorer classes. It has
just gone blindly for the wealthy man’s cause in
the insane belief that by so doing it has been
delivering a series of shocks to the affluent Pope.
Seemingly the party has realised in some degree
the unreason of its past conduct. But a brace of
conflicting interests divide it. The Lodges need
urgently to swell their membership tallies, which
consist for the most part of old women, older
men and cranky fanatics. The only hope
they have of attracting desirable recruits is
to display such a democratic programme
as shall appeal to the normal Australian
working-man—the type, that is, who doesn’t want
the walls of Derry dragged into his legislative
ideals, and who aims at industrial rather than
Vatican reform. But the party is bossed by
clerics whose kirks, chapels, tabernacles and what
not need the financial support of the Vickekys
and Robsons of the community. They depend
largely on prosperous importers with businesses
and unconquerable prejudices regarding the
“ curse of Protection ” and “Labor domination,”
and with perfect trust in the reality of G. Reid’s
Menace. Hitherto (owing to the “pull” of the
well-to-do Church members) the Orange folk have
been tireless barrackers for the Romish workers of
Europe. The Lodges have toiled at election after
election for Freetrade candidates, and at
election after election they have, in conse-
quence, assisted to hand Australian Protestants’
jobs to Roman Catholics in Italy and in France.
They have railed at Arbitration Acts, Factory
Acts and Early Closing Acts as “ un-English ”
interferences with “liberty”—though the only
liberty these measures have interfered with has
been that of the wealthy church members to sweat
their indigent co-religionists. Also they have
opposed the compulsory training of Australians —
the measure which Lord Robebts so strenuously
advocates for the Cold Land —as being “against
the spirit of the British race ” and a plot of the
Cardinal’s. Are Orangemen going to change their
political spots thus suddenly on tbe mere say-so of
Dill and his friends? And, anyhow, are the
Anti-Sosh DiLL-ites, who hold the money-bags,
going to let the heads of the Yellow churches
project themselves into the Labor camp without a
stiff struggle? And if the struggle proceeds to
such a point of acerbity as to wring hints from
the Anti-Sosh quarters of sturdy Protestantism
in re diminished collection plate returns, are
the leaders of the new movement in a position
to resist ? The Bulletin opines not. The crowd
is, in a political sense, incorrigible. Tradition,
habit, bigotry, and a dozen other factors chain it
to the Tory side of the fence. When this paper
learns on reliable authority that Dill has gone on
the election committee of a Parliamentary candi-
date named Hourigan solely for the reason that
Hourigan advocates the principles that were
voiced recently at Clifton, it will believe that the
Yellow Pup, as a body, has found reasonableness.

The letter of “ 0.K.” :
I would like one fine morning to go out with my gun
and kill a “representative Australian” who has just
returned from his first trip to Europe—the sort of repre-
sentative Australian who is usually a mayor. He goes
forth swollen with a personal sense of importance, which
is, after all, quite natural and pardonable and which has
a patriotic spirit in it. He returns with a diminished
sense of personal importance, and no national spirit
whatever, as it seems to me. He has learned in his
travels that all countries are too busy with their own
affairs to be deeply concerned about the mayors and other
matters of a nation that is forming itself 10,000 miles
away. But he has not discovered the simple fact that
those far-off peoples pay absolutely no heed to the pro-
vincial divisions of the country he comes from. He is
still incapable of understanding that the average British,
German, or French conception of Australia—the more
especially since it became a Commonwealth—is as
vaguely general as the average Australian’s idea of
Germany or France. I except Britain, because the pro-
vincialism of the Scottish and Welsh sections of the in-
habitants clings to its national traditions, and has been
imported to this country. The average Australian con-
tinues to think of Britain as three little countries joined to-
gether, whereas itsinhabitants—English, Scotch, or Welsh
—think of Australia as one large continent, without regard
to its State classifications. The mind of a mayor cannot
grasp the Commonwealth situation from a foreign point
of view. Yet he is interviewed by newspaper reporters
when he comes back to his own particular suburb, and
“the impressions he has gained on his travels” are
solemnly recorded for the instruction of his untravelled
fellow citizens.
The Mayor of Camberwell (Melbourne) is one of the
latest of these misleading authorities, and his “ interest-
ing statements ” were given half a column in the Age.
For the most part, he repeated a number of old truths in
a less aptly informative manner than that employed by
the ordinary commercial traveller. When he talked of
emigration he lapsed into the untruthful foolishness of
bigoted provincialism. “ The tide of emigration,” said
worshipful Mr. Mayor, “ has now set in towards
Australia. It is to be regretted, therefore, that
Victoria by her miserable show at the late Exhibition, had
placed herself in a most disadvantageous position as com-
pared with N.S.W., Queensland and Westralia, whose
vigorous policy pursued at the Exhibition had made these
States well known throughout the Kingdom.”
Here is the same old lamentable instance of the Aus-
tralian in England looking at things Australian through
the colored spectacles he brought with him, and persuad-
ing himself that he regards them “ with the eyes of the
world.” As far as the tide of emigration to Australia was
influenced by the allied displays of Australian pro-
duce at the Exhibition in question, the labelling of
the various courts was valueless for advertisement
purposes. The Commonwealth got the collective ad.
If any emigrants were thereby attracted they shaped
their ends in accordance with other considerations
than the difference between the gold “ trophies ” of Vic.
and W.A. and the wool “trophy” of N.S.W., or what
not. Had the Victorian section of the show been magni-
ficent instead of “ miserable ” (which, in the eyes of the
foreigner, it wasn’t), intending emigrants to Australia
wouldn’t have gone to Victoria to take up unavailable
land on the strength of a gilded wooden pyramid in Lon-
don. The Mayor of Camberwell doesn’t even suggest that
the Commonwealth at large suffered any loss by the
alleged ineffectiveness of the Vic. Court at the Exhibi-
tion, but in the supposition that other States gained
emigrants who might have been induced to go to Vic-
toria, the worshipful person betrays his provincialism
whilst showing his ignorance of the country where he
formed his precious impressions.

A pew months ago Australia pole-axed the fatted
calf, emptied the Treasury of considerable good
money, and for a couple of weeks behaved like a
Real Regular Devil in welcoming the Yankee
Fleet to these shores. The visitors partook of
the embonpoint calf, and washed it down with
champagne, and were enthusiastic (like all people
who have fed well) in their praise of Australia
(which, as before mentioned, was behaving like a
Very Particular Devil) and all things Australian.
Beyond the devouring of the bloated calf, and the
generally devilish behavior, nothing in particular
transpired. The fleet then made a call on Japan,

[FOR THE BULLETINS.]
The sweated woman of Great Britain is probably the most
hopeless creature in the world. The Eskimos of the
frozen North, living on oil and dried fish, in the snowed-
up fashion of their winter prisons, cut off from almost
every phase of moral and spiritual culture, know not the
extent of the hopeless dreariness of life of these sweated
mothers of opulent England.-— Daily paper.
While news of the scarcity of employment comes from
all parts of the country, we find that £11,000,000 worth of
foreign manufactured goods were imported in the
short space of 30 days. Not less than half of
that total represents wages paid to foreign workmen.
The depressed state of British trade, the unemployment
problem, and the prospective heavy deficiency in the
national finances are obviously alarming the Government
and its supporters in the House of Commons and the
press. They see that it will be more than ever difficult in
the near future to avoid some change in the fiscal policy
of the country . — Daily paper.
The people starve behind the guns.

The millions wail behind the guns,
“ Protect us or we die ! ”
Oh ! the peril that is toward
Is no jealous foeman’s sword ;
Hunger is our cruel lord—
Hear our cry !
Protect us, O England !
Protect us or we die 1 ”
The people fall behind the guns

Thy splendor is a lie !
For I hear the dying moan
In the shadow of the throne,
Where thy palaces of stone
Reach the sky.
“Protect us, O England!
Protect us or we die ! ”
Of what avail the staring guns?

Starvation mocks your helpless guns.

Can the strength of yonder fort
Drive the> hunger from the court 9
Where the famished poor consort

Protect us or you die ! ”)
The people kneel behind the guns
(Have mercy, O England!)
The people pray behind the guns.
Thou wilt not see them die I
Must the starved British kneel
To a skeleton in steel,
Ere it crushes with its heel
Ev’ry sigh !
(Protect them, O Engla/nd,
And Death shall pass thee by l)
The forge is dead that bore the guns
The Warning, O England !
Cold as the hand of Death the guns.
Upon the ramparts lie ;
For the monsters dumb and blind
Know the peril is behind ;

Whisp’ring by !

Or see thy glory die I ”)

New South’s record score against the

of Great Achievement.*
and there also it partook of the fatted ape, but
something particular did happen. The visible
result of the visit was an agreement between the
itagle and the Chrysanthemum. The principal
provisions of said agreement are that the two
countries are pledged to:—
(1) Respect each other’s trade and territory.
(2) Maintain the Open Door in China.
(3) Guarantee the integrity of the Chinese Empire.
(4) Encourage the development of Jap and Yankee
commerce in the Pacific.
Even the question of colored immigration into the
Western States was dropped in the Eagle’s haste
to make friends with the Chrysanthemum. This
arrangement leaves Australia even more isolated
than before. Having fixed things up with the
Ape-Chrysanthemum person, Uncle Sam’s fleet
will probably go quite out of the Pacific now, in
order to guard larger interests in the Atlantic.
And as Britain is already out of the Pacific, save
for a few inferior vessels of the venerable parent

A False Prophet and a Fool’s Paradise.
Spkaking on the subject of Defence at the
A.N.A. luncheon in Melbourne, Prime Minis-
ter Fisher made some remarks that were wise,
and some that were not nearly so wise. When
Fisher was wise he said that Australia ought to
bog in and do things in the way of training its
people and getting together the materials of war.
When he was not so wise he hinted that, after all,
we might pull through in the matter of Defence
even with our present scanty population, and that
there was no urgency in the matter of immigra-
tion from the Defence point of view. Said Fisher :
Nobody doubts the ability of the people of Australia to
defend themselves. Scotland, with only a tenth of the
population of Australia, defended itself against Europe.
(Cheers.) ... lam anxious for population ; but I won’t
mix up population with defence.
It was a most unfortunate statement for quite a
lot of reasons. Here are some of the reasons :
(1) Scotland didn’t defend itself against Europe, for
Europe never attacked it. The troubles with the Danes
ended about 1040. Then, barring one small scrimmage
with the inefficient Haco of Norway, it had no enemy save
England. And France provided it with a most sturdy and
persistent ally. We have no such ally.
(2) Even when Scotland had only 500,000 people it had
17 to the square mile. We have less than two.
(3) The Scot was as well armed as his enemy in those
days of swords and spears and axes and coats of mail. To
all intents and purposes, we aren’t armed at all.
(4) The Scot certainly maintained a sort of independence
up to 1651. That is to say, his capital was occupied at
times by the enemy. The whole low-lying part of the
country was made a wilderness over and over again, and
foreign armies camped for years in the country. Aus-
tralia wants a much better kind of defence than that.
(5) Finally Scotland was conquered by Oliver Crom-
well, and it never definitely recovered its freedom.
Charles 11. and James 11. kept it in a state of subjection,
and harried it with religious persecutions. Then a revo-
lution in England supplied it with a Dutch king, and it
lost its national Legislature, and became more and more
an appanage of England. Even its national costume was
prohibited by a Parliament sitting in London. That also
is not the kind of defence that Australia desires.
Taking one thing with another, there is nothing
in Scottish history which is calculated to make one
take a cheerful view of Prime Minister Fisher’s
idea that immigration and defence are two dis-
tinct subjects, and that Australia’s present hand-
ful of population is sufficient to save it should
trouble come this way. It is a very small popu-
lation, and the trouble is liable to be very big.

Some Unreliable Figures.
The Melbourne Argus, in its strenuous fight on
behalf of the large Victorian landholder, isn’t
scrupulous as to its methods. In a recent issue,
by way of proving chat there isn’t any big land-
holder at all, it printed a table of large estates in
which it was shown that there were only four
properties in Victoria over 50,000 acres in area ;
only 48 over 20,000 acres ; and only another 49 of
between 15,000 and 20,000 acres. Now the Warr-
nambool Standard, a Tory paper that circulates
in the Western district, and that cannot be sus-
pected of playing tricks on its squatter friends,
prints in its almanac a list of the large landowners
in its own district only. This list includes no
fewer than ten squatters who have over 50,000
acres. They are:—
Robert Chirnsidr, Streatham 51,721
Walter Laidlaw, Coleraine 56,865
Executors of John Moffat, Mortlake .. .. 90,104
Executors of Macpherson, Streatham .. 62,164
Robertson Bros., Balmoral 87,325
W. Phillips, Cavendish 57,553
John Ware, Ararat 50,457
Executors of Sam Wilson, Ballarat .. .. 73,844
Wm. Weatherley, Mortlake .. .-. .. 52,725
Edward Manifold, Camperdown .. .. 56,190
The same publication gives, in its list, no fewer
than 52 stations in its own district with an area
of over 20,000 acres each. And this is one dis-
trict only! It seems, therefore, a fair thing to
ask the Argus where it got its figures from. The
Standard list throws a vivid light on the scan-
dalous manner in which the land is locked up in
the Western district. Some of the “ big families”
own enough land to make a principality. Amongst
them, the Manifolds are the owners of 115,891
acres, divided into six stations. The Robertsons,
of Hamilton, have 151,481 acres, in eight stations.
It takes nearly a page of the almanac to hold the
Robertsons and Manifolds. The Moffats
have 120,000 acres, and the Laidlaws something
like 100,000. And practically the whole of this land
is suitable for small farmers. Still, according to
the Argus, nothing drastic is required.
Plain, Whitewashed Gaol.
The Melbourne Board of Health begins to express
its weariness of the J.P. who crowds on the
Bench whenever any tradesman’s case is on, and
who, while, there, imposes a fine of £5 at most on
the swindling adulterator of milk. The Board’s
inspectors go to a whole lot of trouble to catch the
rascally offenders, and then the sympathetic J.P.
nullifies their efforts. They know milk-dealers
who have reduced the business of adulteration to
a fine art, and who are making a dishonest profit
of from £6OO to £lOOO a year by selling Yan Yean
as milk, and they realise that an occasional £5 or
£lO fine is a mere detail of the man’s balance-
sheet, just like damages to harness or breakages
of cans. Also, they have convincing proof that
this adulteration is wilful; and they say that the
wilful adulterator deserves no mercy. Yet they
know he will get mercy, and more than mercy,
so long as the punishment is left to the J.P.’s indis-
cretion. What is wanted is an amendment of the
Pure Food Act fixing the penalties just as they
are fixed in the Licensing Act—£2 for a first
offence, £lO for a second, and loss of license for a
third ; only as the offence of selling beer after
11.30 p.m. is trivial compared with the crime of
adulterating the sole sustenance of helpless babes,
the penalties should be made vastly more severe.
Even if a fine should be prescribed for a first
offence of wilful adulteration, nothing but gaol
should await a second offence—plain, cold, white-
washed gaol. Then if a man were guilty of a
third offence, it might very well be taken as proof
of just such a kink as the Indeterminate Sentence
Act has been designed to straighten out. These
penalties would not drive any decent citizen out of
the business any more than the heavy penalties of
the Licensing Act deter any honest publican from
continuing to sell beer. Further, whereas the
publican continues to break the law because he is
perpetually urged thereto by his customers, the
milkman’s customers hold out no such induce-
ment ; in his case it is only his greed and
inborn rascality that make him persist in his
adulteration, and the Indeterminate Sentence is
supposed to be the latest and most improved cor-
rective to a persistent and wilful habit of villainy.

John Quick, M.H.R.,'made some scatter-brained
remarks, the other day, at Castlemaine (Vic.),
about what he was pleased to call “ the evils of
centralisation.” John Quick is a fine old Tory
these days, and the remarks were worthy of him.
Here is a specimen :
An agitation had been started by the Labor party to
alter and enlarge the scope of the Federal authority by
adding to it powers of a purely local and domestic
character, which at present belonged to the States.
Going even beyond this, an association had been started
in Sydney, having for one of its objects the total abolition
of State Parliaments and State Constitutions in one clean
sweep. Such scatter-brained proposals should be resisted
by every patriotic Australian. Centralisation would
result in such evils as were the causes of the separation
of Tasmania, Maoriland, South Australia, Victoria, and
Queensland from New South Wales in the old days. Such
centralisation would lead to strife, resistance, and rebel-
lion, and in the end the disruption of the Commonwealth.
The Bulletin takes the liberty, just here, to men-
tion to Mr. John Quick that his statements aren’t
true. There is no such association in Sydney as
he describes. The league, of which Mr. John B.
Steel, of 192 Castlereagh-street, Sydney, is the
president, is a Unification and Reconstruction
league. It only asks for temporary unification so
that the Australian Parliament may have power
to subdivide Australia into States of manageable
size, and endow them with really democratic Con-
stitutions —in short, as a means whereby there
may be done in a year reforms which might other-
wise require two centuries. The league recognises
the foolishness of having all the six State capitals
so huddled together in the extreme south that if
one drew a line from Brisbane to Perth, and
thereby cut all the capitals off the map, the Com-
monwealth would look almost as big as before.
It considers that a State containing 976, ooo square
miles—a State so huge that one part of it is a good
1400 miles away from the State capital—is a hor-
rible example of centralisation, and is “ calculated
to lead to such evils as were the causes of
the separation of Tasmania, Maoriland, S.A.,
Victoria and Queensland from N.S.W. in the old
days.” In fact, the so-called centralisation party
is really a subdivision party. It is Mr. Quick,
with his yearning to have nearly 1,000,000 square
miles of territory administered from the one city
of Perth as at present, who is the centralisation
party.
Dr. Cockburn, once Premier of S. Aus., and a
member of the Federal Convention, was chairman
at the annual meeting of the Australasian Cham-
ber of Commerce in London, held just before the
last mail left with the invoice for the calico ; and,
though he was amongst a crowd which mostly
lives by exporting things to Australia, there
wasn’t any Stinking Fish in his basket. Cock-
burn, in fact, took up the new Australian tariff
and said that he was surprised at its moderation.
There never would have been any howl against it,
he remarked in effeot, if Australia hadn’t pre-
viously been foolish enough to have an “abnor-
mally low tariff.” Also, he observed that
two very special shrieks had been raised
over carpets (20 per cent.) and printed
matter catalogues, etc. (3d. per lb.); and
then, hauling out the Canadian tariff, he
showed that the Dominion’s Protection on the
one was 35 per cent, and on the other
“ Australia’s great offence is that of distance ; if
she were only a little nearer, a great many of
these misunderstandings would be avoided,” he
added. Apparently he was too polite to say that
the “misunderstandings” wouldn’t exist at all if
Australia wasn’t cursed with a set of either
horribly ignorant or horribly unscrupulous
Foreign-trade newspapers, and if it didn’t export
considerable quantities of unpatriotic globe-
trotters who, once on board a P. and O. boat,
reckon that it is “good form” to traduce and
sneer at the country which fills their pockets.
♦
The cheap and nasty P. and O. Indian arrives
yet once more in the limelight through the pub-
licity whioh attaches to the usual knifing incident.
This time it is a rather minor affair—a girl
wounded slightly in the leg whilst walking down
Circular Quay, Sydney, in a crowd. All the
same, it serves to emphasise the fact that the
shambling person who helps to ferry the local
nobility backwards and forwards upon the ocean is
an unreliable savage with all the savage’s evil
proclivities plus most of the vices of a newer
and more ingenious civilisation. The P. and O.
has long enjoyed the aid of the Lascar;
he has helped it to earn its dividends tor
many years past until he must be reckoned as
one of the P. and O. family. Unfortunately for
the P. and 0., that highly-respectable co. has to
shoulder the responsibility of the coffee-colored
person it clutches so violently to its shirt-front;
and of late the responsibility has been particularly
heavy. In swift succession we have had (a) a
murder on the high seas, ( b) a sort of mutiny, and
(o) a stabbing incident. All these have come or
been dragged to light within a very short period.
How many small but dangerous scuffles were
smothered up and punched out in the darkness of
the fo’castle when the wind was high and the
ocean was all round can only be surmised.
If the travelling public is a thinking animal at
all, it must obtain a deal of diversion from the oft-
recurring paragraph which tells how Ram Chunder
inflicted grievous bodily harm or attempted
murder with three knives and an iron bar. Re-
garded as a shipmate for a long voyage, Chunder
is about the most unpromising thing alive. A
crew of trained baboons with a python as bos n
would almost be preferable to a gang of Lascars
whose feelings had been badly ruffled.
The scheme of the “All-Ned” mail service is
receiving some sort of serious consideration
through the specious representations of Dr.
Coulter, Canadian Deputy-Postmaster-General,
who has been buzzing about Australia like
a patent medicine agent. He, or rather
his Government, proposes that a service
from Britain to Australia, via the Atlantic,
Canada, the Pacific, and Maoriland, should be
subsidised to the tune or oratorio of £1,000,000 per
annum, the amount to be contributed in this
way: Britain, £500,000; Canada, £325,000;
Maoriland, £100,000; and Australia, £75,000.
Those amounts are to assist in providing for a
service that will land letters from London in
Sydney in 27 days, and in Adelaide in 29
days; though how that is to be attained,
when the service between Britain and Canada
is weekly, and the service between Canada
and Australia and Maoriland is fortnightly (as
suggested), the voluble Dr. Coulter does
not explain. It is obvious that to save delay
a weekly service on one side of the conti-
nent would have to connect with a weekly service
on the other side, otherwise mails would half
the time lie a week in Vancouver, waiting for a
steamer. However, Australia has already con-
tracted with the Orient Co. for ten years, to land
London mails in Adelaide in 29 days. Consider-
ing that fact, the “ All-Ned” service is, beyond
being of some little advantage to Sydney
and Queensland, practically a sentimental
fad; and, thinking of what that fad is to
cost, Australia should stick to its money.
The Commonwealth already pays a very large
sum in order to get the invoice for the cotton and
the receipt for the sardines rushed at great speed
to the other side ; and that it is tuppence better
off for the rush isn’t clear. Why it should pay
another tuppence for much the same thing, and
then not get the thing after all, isn’t any clearer.
The South Australian coast has had much
the same sort of shipping disaster as the Sydney-
side had lately when the Bega refused to stand up
straight. This time the vessel to heel over is the
Clan Ranald, a huge wheat-carrier ; and it hadn’t
got outside St. Vincent’s Gulf when the trouble
happened. What the trouble really was hasn’t
been made clear. When Lloyd’s surveyor looked
in just before the vessel finished loading, it
had a list to port ; shortly after, when
the few final tons of John Darling’s wheat
had been dropped in, the Clan inclined to
starboard. Evidently Lloyd’s surveyor reckoned
that the vessel had been lying on the bot-
tom, which might account for the see-sawing.
But the 3500-ton ship hadn’t been out of port 12
hours when the list got bigger, and the deck be-
came like the side of an iceberg for precipitous-
ness, and the mostly Lascar and Chinese crew, as
usual, wasn’t much help in time of trouble ;
wherefore no boat was safely launched. Of a
crew of about 65, only four white men and a score
of Asiatics got ashore, partly by swimming, partly
by wreckage, and mostly by lucky accident. In
the way of loss of life, it is the most disastrous
thing that has happened on the S. Australian
coast since the Admella was wrecked 50 years
ago.
The case of the Melbourne coal-lumper
who, for six months past, has been helping to load
steamers when, by all ordinary rules, he should
have been dead and buried, or paralysed, is an
instance of the vitality possessed by the excep-
tional man. It is also of value as showing the
advantage of not knowing what is wrong with
you. for it is fairly safe to bet that Thomas Shaw
would not have been able to go on toiling
amongst other people’s coal had he known
that he was a practically killed man with
a broken neck. Even supposing that the
pain occasioned by the second accident hadn’t
driven him into hospital, it is hard to imagine
that a man’s nerves could long have resisted the
awful knowledge that his vertebrae was out of
joint. Unless the pain is very severe, Thomas is
probably lying in bed feeling dashed sorry that he
ever wandered near the hospital, or allowed the
doctors to turn the rays on to his injured neck.
He can’t very well depart from the institution in
his present damaged condition, for, even if his
neck would hang together enough to keep him
going, his nerves are now probably in that frayed
condition that makes for accident; and it’s all
owing to the dismal knowledge that he has been
alive under false pretences for half-a-year.
In the past, Australia has been flooded
with medical literature issued by. quacks ; and
the damage done has been incalculable. Most of
this pernicious literature has been merely adver-
tising matter which, after detailing a list of
horrors eclipsing the Book of Revelation, stated
that £1 was sufficient to send for the medicines
that would be forwarded securely sealed. Good
medical literature would do a lot of good and
command a ready market. People who cannot
walk round the corner to a doctor require to have
some reliable medical authority on the book-shelf.
This is now available, The Bulletin Co.
having issued a set of Dr. P. E. Muskett’s works
complete for £3. Dr. Muskett is a recognised
authority of high standing, and his work on the
management and feeding of infants has probably
saved many valuable little lives.*
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

Theatre Royal “ The Breed of the Treshams/'
Criterion “ The Squatter’s Daughter.”
Palace “ Martha.”

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty's “ Jack and Jill.”

Napoleon continues to dream great dreams
and overlook his washing bill at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney); and J.C.W. has now made so much
profit out of the omission that he could very well
afford to square up with the lady and paste the
receipt on the forgetful gentleman’s tombstone.
There is no slackening of interest in “The
Duchess of Dantzic ” ; for the public realises that
it gets two shows for the money—a drama and a
musical comedy performance ; and both of them
are good, even though the musical comedy part is
very sober except in the matter of clothes.

For but eight nights more—calculating
from Thursday, February 4, inclusive—will
Julius Knight appear as a pale, worn outcast at
Sydney Royal. For but eight nights more will
he be arrested, insulted, branded with red-hot
irons, and generally treated as a social neglige-
able. On Saturday week he becomes the anti-
thesis of The Rat —to wit, the florid, bibulous,
gorgeously-frocked schemer who was the Scarlet
Pimpernel. Bulletin readers are urged to hurry
up before it is too late, and observe Julius in the
r6le of oppressed villain with a heart of gold.

‘‘ A Modern Adventuress ” at Sydney
Palace is too swift a female pirate for this paper.
She rushed on to the Palace stage on Saturday
(January 30), which was too late for last week’s
issue ; and she disappeared into the canvas wings
on Wednesday (February 3), which was some
eight or nine hours before The Bulletin reader
was due to purchase his copy of this issue. Any-
how, she was merely a revived Adventuress; the
peach-bloom complexion that denotes the new
play was absent from her cheek, and her unimport-
ance may be gauged by the fact that the
management divided a week between her and the
anguished howls of “East Lynne.” Appropriately
enough, the weather has collapsed utterly at the
approach of the longest sustained sob in the
British language; beyond this scribe’s grimy
window, the skies are leaden and the streets are
slush, so that when the cab-horse can be induced
to hurry, his feet make a low-spirited, slopping
sound which suggests that he has forgotten to lace
up his hoofs. On the afternoon of Friday (Feb-
ruary 5) a benefit will be tendered to Mr. Harry
Diver—the capable actor who stepped into “The
Broken Home” when that cracked edifice was in
urgent need of assistance, owing to an accident
that happened to Jefferson Taite.

“ The Old Folks at Home ” will arise with
grey hairs on their heads, and their mouths
full of sentiment and good advice, on Saturday
(Feb. 13), at the Palace. A company of mimes,
including Beatrice Holloway, J. B. Atholwood,
Conway Wingfield and others, will impersonate
the Old Folks, for a brief season, at the behest of
the four-name firm of Rupert Clarke, John Wren,
Meynell and Gunn. The Aged Parties are at
present abroad at Newcastle, but they can be de-
pended on to arrive at the appointed time in a
good state of preservation, and with all their
faculties intact.

As the Bilanderson advts. modestly admit
regarding “Man to Man,” now occurring nightly
at Sydney Criterion, “the crowded houses, the
continued and overpowering applause, the enthu-
siastic calls and recalls amply testify to the in-
herent vitality of this popular and strikingly
powerful play.” Nevertheless, there was talk of
“Romeo and Juliet ” displacing the more modern
masterpiece. It was understood that Miss
Eugenie Duggan would sustain the r6le of the
maid whose birthday greetings were due annually
on Lammas night, and the hopes of local Sliak-
spearians ran high accordingly. But what
with the tariff, Federal mismanagement, the
domination of Sosh, the outbreak of fruit-fly, and
other injurious influences, the scheme was found
impracticable. And so on Saturday night next
“The Squatter’s Daughter ” will be revived. It is
the chef d’ceuvre of Bert Bailey and Edmund
Duggan. Comment were superfluous.

To Sydney Tivoli this week have come
sketch artists Geoffrey and Benson, but the bill is
otherwise full brother to the one the usher handed
the nobility and gentry when the skirts of January
were disappearing down the stairs. The title of
G. and B.’s item is “Spoofed,” and although it is
moderately hilarious, it is hardly sufficient induce-
ment for the “patron” who has seen the rest of
the show previously to lay his cash on the box
office. The management should enforce the move-
on clause —that is, if such a thing is handy. A
second part with two or three new items looks a
lot fresher than a second part with only one. As
one of Rickards’ own artists was wont to remark
as he carefully revolved in front of the footlights,
‘ ‘ One good turn deserves another ! ” Lawson and
Namon, Amalia and Leonora, Cristofolo, Good-
fellow and Gregson, and Mackinnon’s Scottish
Meisters, as before, comprise the five chapters of
an oft-told notice.

The popularity of the moving pictures
grows and grows ; and the viewing of them has
risen to the dignity of a vice. People who used
to go to a theatre once in a month now spend every
night in the week meandering round a score of
picture shows. Therefore the Glaciarium and the
Lyceum, in Sydney, are both packed to the doors
with the people who have the set face and
wrinkled eyes of the picture maniac. At Spencer’s
Lyceum the chronomegaphone is still whirring,
and Harry Lauder and Albert Whelan, the imita-
tionist, are the star spooks. Writer prefers
Albert Whelan. He is the cleverer and more enter-
taining spook of the two. Both shows are giving
fine representations of the ruinwhelmed districts
of Sicily and the mainland of Italy, as they were

everlasting hills were tumbled down into the

are highly interesting. If either Spencer or West
would make the local hair to stand like the quills
upon the potato pen-holder, a good representation
of the little ledge that Sydney stands upon, taken
from about one day’s steam outside the Heads,
would be wildly attractive. West will shortly

tale hold pride of place easily.

This is the seventh week of “ Jack and
Jill” at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), but that
well-matured panto, continues to kick up its heels
with all the vigor of a young beginner. Eight
times a week the estimable spectacle comes to
pass, and 16 times a fortnight the house is either
full or overcrowded, the surplus population being
particularly numerous on Saturday nights. Thus-
far the matter of a change of bill has not been
even faintly suggested by the advt. Probably
“Jack and Jill” will not last for ever. Its
glories will fade and die, or it will have to be
withdrawn from Melbourne ere its body has
ceased to pulsate with profit. Nevertheless the
Williamsonian panto, presents in its seventh week
the appearance of immortality.

The foregoing remarks are equally true of
“ Cinderella.” Excepting the interpolation of one
or two new songs, the best of which is supplied by
Miss Ruth Lincoln, the performance at the Royal
is just what it began to be the Saturday before
the Goose died. It is still going strong. The
advt. has a way of saying “Better see ‘Cinder-
ella,’” and The Bulletin rises to support the
remark. There are shows that one would rather
not have witnessed, but “Cinderella” belongs to
the other class. Better see it more than once.
AT MELBOURNE KING'S.
WALTER BAKER as
Sailor Jack.
MISS FRANCES
ROSS as Sailor
Jack's Jill.
“ Sailor Jack ” Baker is to prove his
in-no-cence for yet another week at Mel-
bourne King’s. Not that the proof would
carry any weight in a criminal court. The
virtuous mariner in question (who never, never
goes to sea) practically accused himself of a
murder by clearing out before the coroner’s jury
could return a verdict against him. The old man
who did the deed nullifies the effect of his con-
fession by dying before it can be taken down in
writing, and of the two men who saw it perpe-
trated the respectable one (who is a wealthy vil-
lain in an undeniable tall hat) professes to think
that Baker was the murderer, whilst the counter-
swearer is a boozer with a shocking character. In
fact, there is nothing in Baker’s innocence
that looks likely to save him from convic-
tion, though he might possibly get his sen-
tence commuted to a “ lifer.” Also, it is obvious
that Baker can’t attempt to explain his flight from
the inquest without acknowledging himself an
accessory to the murder after the fact. His tardy
champion, the boozer, charges himself with the
same criminal offence, whereas the influential
villain is the only person concerned in the affair
who could get off scot-free by denying everything.
Regarded from a legal point of view, the villain
in Baker’s drama is the least guilty person that
ever brought trouble into a farmer’s family, and
the most sought after for matrimonial purposes.
Mabel wants to marry him on account of
his wickedness to her, and sister Mary is
prepared to become the mother of his
family when Baker proposes to hand her
over to the gentleman in order to make things
pleasant all round. Another notable peculiarity
of Baker’s drama is its glorification of Jabez
Slouch, the thirsty miscreant. The amphitheatre
positively adores Jabez at the finish, owing to his
snakelike methods. When he promises to bite
the hand that had bribed him he is hailed as the
good angel of the piece. Up to then Bert Bailey
gets all the love and esteem of the Anderson
public, but Bailey proves valueless as a prover of
innocence, therefore he is relegated to a back seat,
whilst the shabbiest evil-doer in the crowd is
placed on a pinnacle of approbation, with the lime-
light streaming on his insobriety.
» * ■* *
Following up the success of this his first
effort in drama-malting, Baker will bring his
personal supervision to bear upon a more rational
undertaking. Bartley Campbell’s old play, “My
Partner,” is in rehearsal at the King’s, and the
tradition of George Rignold’s mighty fine per-
formance in the character of Joe Saunders should
recommend the revival to serious notice. Mean-
while “ Sailor Jack ” is getting serious notice from
all who can find humorous diversion in its comic
relief. To be tickled by the “funny” scenes is to
be thrilled by the unintentionally droll ones.

At Melbourne Opera House a comely white

Melbourne is invited to renew acquaint-
ance with its old friend Philip Newbury at the
Town Hall next Saturday (6th). The tenor voice
of Newbury and the cultured art of the vocalist
are treasured recollections in Melbourne. His
was the standard voice by which subsequent
warblers have been judged (and condemned in
most cases), and as there will be only two oppor-
tunities of hearing it before it voyages to Maori-
land, the Town Hall should not be too large for
the audiences. The second concert will happen
on Tuesday.

The A.N.A. Anniversary Day procession
through Melbourne on Monday was almost dis-
appointing enough to be treated as a bad joke.
Firstly, the officials made the mistake of including
in the march a number of grimy cyclists who
seemed not over-clean and distinguished. Then
they broke the procession—or the tram co., clutch-
ing ever for dividends, broke it for them—for
there was a tiring interval between the advance
guard of unsoaped bikists and the main body of
highly-decorated humans and devices. This main
body might be described in the language of a
primer, thoughitispropertoemploy the most exotic
English in praise of the sentiment animating it.
Here and there it had placarded itself, putting a
label on its patriotism, as it were ; and, as
if that were not enough, it studded its meagre
length with whites masquerading as thickly-
whislcered King Billies, sometimes near to nature
in a complete suit of burnt cork, and sometimes
near to comfort in not too sumptuously filled
black tights. Then there were the police troopers
of antiquity forming a supposed gold escort,
and quite a number of those alleged bushmen
who affect pale drab riding breeches, and those
warm red shirts that ought to be put aside to
cool. The pastoral, agricultural, and mining
industries were distinctly hinted at on lorries
festooned with greenery, and a butcher, for no
apparent reason, had trotted out five or six of
his carts decorated with that dreamy elegance of
which only a butcher would be capable. Of
course, the allegorical tableaux, in which pale
maidens pose in severe classical costume and
a little paint, were not altogether absent.
The Spirit of Australia pushing into the future
had to be symbolised by a half-dozen damsels in
a boat, with another standing magnificently in the
stern, her countenance buried in reverie. Another
lady, who tried to appear Grecian in a bath robe
of pale canary, stood on a pedestal, bleak and
grim as any Venus with a pain. The poor lady
was representing some great spirit or idea, but
didn’t seem to like it. There was little else in the
procession except trams, and they pushed in and
out with the usual indifference of Private Enter-
prise to everything but filthy lucre.

T. Burns is putting in a strenuous week
at Adelaide Tivoli, giving exhibition spars with
Baker and others. There is also a shadowy Burns,
who repeats on a screen his fine spectacular
knoeking-out of Gunner Moir in London.
It is impossible to let bygones be by-
gones now that the biograph has come to
stay, and a little incident that one might
wish to forget becomes (1) World-wide and (2)
Eternal. Down at Glenelg, the Pierrots are
putting up a clean and clever (and highly profit-
able) show to cheap open-air houses on the beach ;
also, in the same place, two competent humorists
have given a realistic burlesque of the Burns-
Johnson disturbance. When the “police”
interfered, they were immediately thrown into
deep water, the referee was hurled after them,
then the fighters ; in fact, the only thing not
thrown in was the towel.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Tommy Burns, who was always a showman, is about to
break out in a tresh place. The Bijou Theatre, Mel-
bourne, will be known as the Burns Theatre from March 1,
and Thomas will figure as lessee and manager. Also
Thomas is going to act, he says. He intends to tour
Australia in a drama, by George Darrell, entitled “Fame
and Fortune,” unless Johnson is prepared to “give him
another chance ” —in London. One may safely, predict
that Johnson will offer him another chance, and if Burns
accepts it the tour of “ Fame and Fortune” will, presum-
ably, be interrupted. But these are questions quite
apart from the interesting announcement of what the new
theatrical entrepreneur intends to do at his theatres —for
he will want more than one of them, of course. He in-
tends “ going in for a high-class kind of drama, and with
that object in view will bring out from America some of
the leading companies.” When he isn’t importing fust-
rate talent from Amurka he will make a point of en-
couraging Australian actors, of whom he has a good
opinion, it seems. Therefore this country may look for-
ward to the day when Mr. Burns’s specially selected
Shakspearian co. will appear in “ Hamlet,” with himself
as the melancholy Dane.
“0.K.”: The talk of Tommy Burns appearing: on the
stage sets one thinking of a mightier pug than
Tommy who came from America to Australia for
histrionic purposes. John L. Sullivan was that re-
markable “ star ” actor. He played the blacksmith hero
in a play entitled “ Honest Hearts and Willing Hands,”
or something, and on the first night, if I remember
rightly, the brawny blacksmith presented himself in a
dress suit and patent-leather shoes. He was very indig-
nant when the audience at Melbourne Opera House
treated him as a joke, but his own exalted opinion of
Jonel Sullivan didn’t save the season from disastrous
failure. Apparently Jonel didn’t think himself called
upon to try to act, but, anyhow, the man was destitute of
the dramatic instinct. A professional champion boxer and ■
wrestler who might have earned a crust on the theatrical
stage was Professor Miller. Now and again he took the
part of Charles the Wrestler in “As You Like It,” and his
method of succumbing to a strangle hold by Orlando
(whom he could have easily picked up and killed a fiddler
with) was impressively artistic. The last time I saw Miller
as a mummer he played a dumb-show part in Geo. Miln’s
production of “ Antony and Cleopatra,” and did it very
well.
“10-2-4”: I note that Tommy Burns intends touring
Australia with a Darrell play entitled, “Fame and For-
tune.” I can’t quite visualise Thomas in bellowdrama.
It is not his line. He is too stolid, too wholly and en-
tirely Teutonic to play the part of one of those verbose,
emotional, insanely-chivalrous young fellows whom
Darrell loves to create. Noah Brusso has a personality,
without doubt, and a strong one. But it is not the sort
that will carry him with credit through a heated scene
with a villain who has behaved shamefully, and caused
him (Brusso) to be gaoled for crimes of which he
was as innocent as a bloque unborn. If Mr. Johnson’s
late adversary is not to be made to appear utterly fatuous
when he first faces the footlights in a grease-painted state
he must have his roles specially manufactured for
him. Something in this line should suit Thomas and the
theatre-going public. The villain (a tall black scoundrel)
tries to best Noah Brusso (hero) in a business deal. An
argument follows. Ethiopia is routed. The two
men are shown in their respective offices hard at
work. The untutored savage would fain defeat
the cultured and commerce-wise white in a
Stock Exchange deal. The white ■is quiet, cold,
confident. He tells his sweetheart, his faithful retainers,
the audience, everybody, that the inky hound in the
next room is in for a severe financial discrediting.
Act 111. would disclose the Stock Exchange, with Noah
and his colored foe manoeuvring. The doomed black
might here be allowed something in the nature of a mo-
mentary triumph. But in Act IV. Africa’s stock must
slump heavily. An effective finale to this act would be
the “ hammering” of the Dark Cloud before a stupefied
band of city men, the while two comic pugilists and their
brides jeered at the fallen one. During this process Noah
would stand, with Napoleonic impassivity, in the centre
of the stage. It would be a graceful and telling move on
his part if he gently bade the comedians to desist from
merriment after a while, and urged them to recall that,
“though black, the defeated one was yet a man and a
brother.” In conclusion, the pulverised nig might be
shown filing his schedule, or enduring a stinging tongue-
lashing from the Master in Bankruptcy. Noah, contrari-
wise—still suave, quiet and cool—would appear in a scene
called “ Interior of the Bank of All Australia.” Adoring
cashiers would flock round him, and clerks would protrude
their heads over their partitions and cheer. Amid
frenzied enthusiasm he would proceed towards the “ pay-
ing-in ” counter and put £2,000,000 to his current account
and £6,000,000 on fixed deposit. Then the curtain would
fall.
While in Adelaide the Julius Knight mummers enlisted
the services of a local horse to add realism to the opening
scene of “The Scarlet Pimpernel.” It was hired for
three nights from the owner, one of the bottle-oh
brigade, and the rent of the beast was 30s. It was a
sorry-looking steed, all bones and a handful of skin, but
the proprietor said it would just do for the “ Pimplenut,”
as he would insist in calling the drama. The horse dis-
puted honors with Julius for two nights, but on
the third evening it did not appear, nor did
it send a letter explaining its absence. The owner
took it to the theatre, as usual, tied it up outside the
stage door, and went into an adjacent pub for a re-
fresher. When he returned, the horse was gone. The
co. was in despair, and played the “ Pimpernel ” as best
it could, minus the horse. Next day was a holiday, and
the local students’ saturnalia. Most of the Knight
mummers were watching the foolishness from the win-
dows of a leading hotel. Suddenly arose from them all
a great shout of “ The Pimplenut.” There in the proces-
sion, garlanded with flowers, was the old gee-gee that ought
to have drawn Julius safely through the painted streets of
Paris the night before. Inquiries were subsequently
made as to how and why the animal had accepted a new
engagement, and it transpired that some youngsters had
“ pinched ” it from the theatre door, and hired it out for
a bob to the mortar-boards. The horse was never
destined for histrionic honors again. When it was re-
turned to the bottle-oh man it died.
“ Stargazer ” : When Manager Ed. Geach’s leading man
was outed by a cab, or a furniture van, and a pro. had to
be snared off the street to play the hero of “ The Broken
Home,” I was reminded of the experience of “ The Last
Crime” Continental and American Dramatic co., at
Lefroy (Tas.). When this gifted co. was ready to give its
initial performance, the male star was out on the adjacent
hills, chasing new and original fantods to glue in his
specimen book. The idea of closing the house and
returning £25 15s. was too dreadful to be entertained,
and Colvin, the ponderous “ heavy,” decided to double
villain and hero. It was a herculean task, but Colvin
was a dramatic Hercules, and went at it with confidence
and zeal. The fact that hero and villain had many argu-
ments and a few fights did not disconcert Colvin. He
had a black wig in his left hand and a fair wig in
his right. The black wig stood for vice, the fair one
for virtue. When the sagacious actor ceased ranting
as the rascal, he tore off the black head of hair, and, sub-
stituting the golden coiffure, cooed as the virtuous young
person. In moments of fierce debate Colvin had only
time to make alternate dabs at his naturally bald head
with the distinctive wigs, and the Lefroy miners, regard-
ing the effort as a feat of juggling, applauded uproari-
ously. Of course there were dubious moments. For
instance, we do not know to this day whether it was the
villain who threw the hero into the raging torrent, or the
hero who threw the villain, or whether each threw the
other. But when, in the last act, Colvin as the hero slew
Colvin as the villain, and then arose, donned the fair wig,
and married the heroine, the house rocked with merri-
ment, and the hurt and indignant actor, who stepped
forward to enter a protest, was received with a shower of
silver. “ The Last Crime ” ran for a week, and Colvin
had to double those parts every night. The audience in-
sisted on it, and on the second night howled the substi-
tuted hero out of the house.
“0.K.”: The comparatively crude semi-nude glidings
and posturings of Maud Allan, accepted by Lon-
don as revelations in art, are not even new in
idea. Similar suggestions of the ancient Greek
dancing were introduced in Melbourne by Florrie
Green before Maud Allan had been heard of. The
latter, a plain-looking girl, barefooted and scantily
draped about the body, performs to the music of Mendels-
sohn’s Spring Song. The Melbourne girl, pretty in face
and figure, and a beautifully skilled dancer, puts all her
art into a poetic interpretation of the same Mendelssohn
music. In a cant way of speaking, Florrie Green has
forgotten more than Maud Allan ever learned about any
sort of dance movement; but she never forgot to dress
herself gracefully. And as for the humbug of barefooted
dancing—if shoes are an impediment to the wearer’s pro-
gress in any performance where “lightness of foot” is
a first essential, why do tennis-players wear ’em ?
“Star” : Eight out of ten actors, and almost as many
actresses, are sore footed. Why is this thus? Is there
something in continual walking of the boards that entails
a sad derangement of the human hoof? Or can it be that
dire pedestrian efforts entailed in walking back after
disastrous provincial tours play up with the extremities ?
The fact that popular and profitable pros are similarly
afflicted is no argument against the latter theory, as even
the most successful of them may have been walking
gentlemen in the earlier stages. Anyhow, actors are a
footsore race, and I can mention a number of well-known
people who, for this reason alone, would greatly prefer to
do it on their heads.
“S.T.S.”: I have had the rapid development of the
British drama impressed on me by seeing; a good-enough
amateur rendering 1 of a comedy once famous, “ The Guv -
nor,” of which one line survives in the public memory :
“ Your ’and, Guv’nor, your ’and!” This play was first
staged in 1880. Thatis, it isatrifle older than “ The Private
Secretary ” and a trifle younper than “ Our Boys, to
which it is a near relative. Yet it seems to come from an
altogether past age. All the elderly people are comic;
all the young people are romantic. The girls have
no interest in life beyond love-making, and
at' 18 are engaged to be married. The author,
a little-known person called Lankester, thought-
fully gives the age of each of his characters. The fathers,
at 48 and 52 respectively, are old men, infirm and rather
a nuisance to their families. One of them has taken a
second wife, aged 25, and must, as a consequence of thv_
wild venture, expect her to desert him for someone less
patriarchal. The dialogue is thickly studded with far-
fetched puns. Coincidence is rampant, everyone being mis-
taken for someone else who was due at the same moment,
and nobody having the sense to suspect a misunderstand-
ing. Last and worst, the play breaks out at the end into
16 lines of rhymed couplets, every character getting a' line
or two. The device of finishing off with a tag of verse is
at least as old as Shakspeare, and I should fancy “ The
Guv’nor ’’ must have been the very last example of it.
Only 28 years back ! Our comedies of to-day may not be
great things, but we have moved on some way since 1880.
“Busk”: The authorised biography of Irving, by
Brereton (2 vols.), is just to hand in Australia. He re-
ceived every help from Irving’s sons, Irving’s widow, and
all Irving’s friends and acquaintances, being also himself
a friend, or rather friendly acquaintance, of the great
actor. All his papers were apparently handed over to
Brereton. Yet he doesn’t get the straw for the bricks.
Irving, the man, remains a mystery. Any quantity of
detail about Irving the actor. Ellen Terry, the nearest
approach to a Boswell, palpably concludes that he was
not a great man —only a great histrionic executant.
You are not to find the Hamlet inside him.
John Henry Brodribb was always called John in his
youth. His mother was much distressed at John s
theatrical aspirations. His father lived to see him the
triumphant Lyceum manager. Hoskins wanted to take
him to Australia in 1856, and offered £5 a week (where
would Billy have got it ?). Irving’s mother sa,ved him from
this. Phelps offered him £2 a week, to begin in about a
year. Irving, however, resolved not to commence
in London. On Hoskins’s written recommenda-
tion he got the Sunderland engagement, where
he started by acting gratis for a month. His
first performance at the Edinburgh theatre was with
Barry Sullivan, who acted Richelieu. In 1859 he first;
appeared in London, with a small part in “ Ivy Hall.
Dissatisfied with this, he obtained the cancellation of his
engagement, and did not perforin in London again till
1866. His striking performance in the provinces of Raw-
don Scudamore, in Boucicault’s “ Hunted Down,” led
Boucy to obtain him an engagement to act the same part
at the London St. James’s. However, he made his debut
in “ The Belle’s Stratagem.” Lewis and George Eliot saw
it. Lewis said Irving would be at the head of the London
stage. George Eliot said, “He is there already.” There is
no evidence that Dickens ever saw him act Sikes, as
commonly stated. Dickens saw him as Redburn, in
“ The Lancashire Lass,” and said he would be a gr at
actor. When he acted first with Ellen Terry she had £l5
a week, and he onlv got £7. He married Florence
O’Callaghan in 1869. She was daughter of the ex-Surgeon-
General of the Indian army. When “ Fanchon ” failed at
the Lyceum (1871), manager Bateman wanted Irving to
go with him to America. Bateman had no faith before-
hand in “The Bells.” About 10 nights before Irving’s
appearance in it a version presented at another London
theatre was condemned. Irving was very much averse
to acting Richelieu, Bateman’s good idea later on. Mrs.
Bateman’s management fell through because Irving ob-
jected to the Misses Bateman as leading actresses.
“ The Profesh ” : There is sweating in other places than
clothing factories. A big Australian city owns a dra-
matic co. addicted to plays of the hair-raising class whose
supers rehearse once and sometimes twice a day, play at
night (in some cases having as many as three changes of
clothes in a show !) and provide their own disguises—all
for 12s. per week. About 48 hours’ toil for a dozen
roberts 1 Thrippence an hour ! If anyone knows of a
more economically managed show than this I should
admire to hear from him.
There is a theatrical person in Australia whom actresses
coo about with double-distilled bitterness all because hf
his distressing mania for climbing about the theatre to
peep through windows and cracks. The habit, it is
thought, must be an awful worry to the poor fellow,
apart altogether from the outside chance he runs of
breaking his neck.
The offensive London habit of smoking in theatres has
received a big impetus. Hitherto it has been the chief
mark of music hall (of however high-class), as opposed to
the dramatic show' (however low). But now the Lord
Chamberlain, who has control of these matters, has let
the managers of the “ regular ” theatres know that they
can do just as their patrons wish ; and apparently those
who wish to smoke are enough to carry the day in many
houses.
“ Vic.” : In a paragraph I wrote here on Vic. goldfields
theatres (21/1/’O9), a compositor, or somebody, altered
Charley Thatcher to Richmond Thatcher. I knew both
these Thatcher brothers. Charley was the star of the
Shamrock Music Hall, Bendigo—Billy Heffernan’s place.
He married Lydia Howarde, who appeared asprimadonna
in Melbourne with Lyster’s opera company. Charley’s
name was O. R. Thatcher. Was his second name Rich-
mond? I don’t know, but he was always called Charley.
He composed lots of songs, and you may yet pick up
Thatcher’s song-book, with his wistful-looking portrait
on the paper cover. One of his songs was a parody on
Bent’s favorite, “Ben Bolt”—not Horace Bent, but
Thomas Adolphus—
“ Oh, don’t you remember Green Gully, Jack Jaggs?
Green Gully of gullies so fair—
Where we buckled in and lined our old swags
With three hundred ounces a share ? ”
Then there was Charley’s younger brother, Richmond
Thatcher, universally known in Sydney as Dick, and
somewhat less familiarly in Melbourne. Didn’t he write
for The Bulletin ? He was a free-and-easy, clever sort of
journalist, and the first to write an account of the railway
trip from Sydney to Melbourne. He became a theatrical
agent, with Mrs'. Scott Siddons, etc.
THE GOMEDY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No merry clown in cap and bells
Is he,
His merchandise, the jest he sells,
Is forged with pain, nor ever wells
Joyous and free ;
Others may laugh, but still for him it spells
Bread, butter, beef and tea.
Wamba and Touchstone and the rest
Were fools,
In jolthead mirth they found a zest,
Made their dull sallies with the best
By well-formed rules ;
Then motley did not wholly pass unblest
In camps, and courts, and schools.
But the slow centuries have set
A pace,
And the jokemaker’s brow is wet
With something more than Adam’s sweat;
Swift is the race
To overtake some mirth that lingers yet
With young and smiling face.
Weighted with care the statesman’s brow
Is Bent,
Weary the toilsome cult of Cow,
And sad the heart that chases now
Five quid it lent;
But laughter’s weight is heavier I trow
Where we our jests invent.

Fearing they know not what. And now begins,
Slow yet inevitable that which chills
The stoutest heart to ice. Palaces sink
To their foundations, mighty domes and spires
Keel for a space, then hurtle down. The gale,
Long-threatened, is unleashed ; screaming it tears
Over the hissing waves. The mountain-top
Leaps of a sudden into scarlet flame.
Crash upon crash, as though close under foot
All Hell were warring, horrifies the ear.
And through it all, like to a long sea swell,
The earth rolls restlessly, and over it
The white hot lava wends its dreadful way.
A thousand death-screams rend the burning air ;
A thousand horrors start on ev’ry side ;
Death marches grinning through the anguished land
To rag-time from the Newtown-Metrop. Band.

HAUNTED.
It is stated that the Government will give & tor every £
collected by councils at all the chief resorts of surf
bathers. Is the Government in earnest, and does it
expect councils to appoint persons to cadge collections
on the beaches ?—Letter in Sydney Paper.
Soon there will he no escape from the collection-
box, either ashore or afloat.
The luck of Ah Sin is out in Sydney.
About a fortnight ago the Customs got hold of a
lot of his opium, and now they seem to have got
hold of Sin himself. When the pilot steamer
Captain Cook found 400 tins of the dream
material floating off North Head attached to a
lifebuoy, it was plain that Sin and his friends
were not going without their smoke. The com-
plete absence of Sin from the seascape, where his
property was floating at large, might have been
due either to plain funk or to carelessness.
How many hysterical, wet Chows had
searched through the blind, black night for
that £2OOO packet until dawn made it un-
safe to be pottering about any longer in
full view of the cliffs, can only be guessed at.
Possibly the confederate on the steamer got
mixed, and heaved the dope over at the wrong
time; in which case the shore Chows were pro-
bably sleeping on the customary heap of bananas
when the untimely deed was done. Their re-
marks, when news of the capture reached them,
must have strained theresources of all known Chow
cursing. After the find, the Customs laid its ears
back; so when the Empire was leaving Sydney
last week an unobtrusive launch butted
along behind it to the Heads, and watched the
big ship clear away for Melbourne. When it was
a mere smudge on the horizon a strange launch
came up from nowhere in particular, and nosed
about as if looking for fish or the lost will men-
tioned in Anderson’s drama. For six weary,
blistering hours the Customs officers waited arid
watched; but at last, when the sun was putting on
his coat after his day’s work, the stranger was seen
to swing round and scoot for the entrance. That
was where the mistake came in; it should have
scooted for Brisbane. Then the Customs people
turned their craft towards home, and fled up the
harbor ahead of the suspected vessel. The final
swoop of the Law was delayed until the smugglers
were about to go ashore at an uptown wharf,
and then the Fowl of Justice made its dive, and
got its talons into six wet sacks containing 867
tins of opium, worth anything up to £3OOO. With
the North Head lot, that makes about £4OOO
worth of smoke arrested within one short fort-
night, and if Sin and Hang Fat and Ah Too Soon
aren’t dancing mad, then the impassivity of Far
Cathay is the real goods.

A unique sort of strike has been in pro-
gress at North Prentice, in the Rutherglen (Vic.)
district, where the housefathers and mothers have
declined to send their youngsters to the school
until the Department replaces the dilapidated
educational shanty with something less resembling
a crushed cowshed. The Public Works Depart-
ment, which till recently was bossed by that jest
of an administrator, old Farmer Cameron, pro-
mised about two years ago to get an unused build-
ing humped from another site. Actually it got as
far as calling for tenders; but as it considered
these a trifle too high, it postponed the job, and
has gone on postponing it ever since. Now that
the school has come to a dead stop, the Depart-
ment intends to really do something But it isn’t
rushing matters. The “strike” had been in
progress ten days before Education Minister
Billson, who is a novice and unacquainted
with red tape, became officially aware of
it. Then he threatened to upset the placid,
gradual progress of affairs ; but the Department
looked at Billson as at some new beetle it had
never heard of, and assured him that that wasn’t
the way to do things. He must first of all send up
an officer to make a report on the matter ; then
the report must be compared with previous ones,
and with others that might come to hand from
other interested parties; then it must be properly
docketed, numbered, and initialled ; then it must
be passed on to the Public Works Department,
which would also report, examine, minute and
initial. And by the time Billson is an old man,
and the Prentice children are all either grown up
or dead, the matter might possibly be in train for
tenders to be called anew for shifting the vacant
building the necessary two miles or whatever
it is. Billson is at present in a highly explosive
state, and swears to be the death of red-tape.
And though bigger and stronger men than he
have often tackled that job, this paper wouldn’t
for worlds discourage Billson’s murderous inten-
tions.

S. M. Herald? During the last N.S.W.-S.A.
match I noticed about 17 flags
flying—viz., two white ensigns,
eight assorted Jacks (union and
dis-union, the latter being in a
very holey state), a German flag,
and sundry club and association
banners or oriflammes or some-
thing. Also (of course) the old
N.S.W. “colonial” flag. But I
looked in vain for our own
Australian flag. Noticed the
same thing during present
N.S.W.-Victoria match, only
some flags had been repaired.
Still no Australian flag. I sup-
pose, under the Dog Act, or
Wade’s lovely Police Offensive
Act, the Australian flag is interdicted, and the
committee would be fined £2 and costs if it flew
one.— Clarence O’Hagan.

“Sr ” : Melbourne Paunch introduced its
political fetich on the very cover of its blessed
Annual. A picture of a moist, watery lady was in-
scribed, “ This picture colored in England.” Our
unemployed litho-grafters must bless Paunch.
THE HARD ANSWER THAT TURNETH
ON WRATH.
HE: “ I simply tell you, plainly, I won’t stand it!”
SHE: “ Well, I’ve never questioned your sim-
plicity nor your plainness yet, dear.”
The amazing luck of T. Taifc and of the
people who trust themselves to his trains still
holds good. On January 25 the Melbourne-Sydney
express slithered up to Wangaratta (Vic.) sta-
tion at 50 miles an hour. It was supposed to stop
at Wangaratta; but the brakes failed to act,
so it kept on till it was pulled up by the hand-
brake half a mile further on. As the outfit
swerved from the main line to the station siding
and back again, it tossed the passengers about like
footballers in a ruck, and drove the guard head
first through a window. Fortunately, Sunshine
didn’t repeat itself—this time the line was clear,
and there was no call for the hospital train. But
when T. Tait heard of it, it is alleged that it set
him thinking so hard for three minutes that he
let his cigar go out.
» * * *
The Melbourne Morgue statistics for last
year make gruesome reading. The 958 deaths re-
corded include 11 murders, 47 manslaughters (the
Sunshine victims accounted for 44 of these), 69
suicides and 120 fatal accidents. Another 120
careless corpses were found dead, or found
drowned, or were discovered defunct otherwise ;
and the rest on the list died from natural causes.
Poisoning is still the most popular form of suicide
in Victoria, with 19 adherents; hanging and
shooting dead-heat for second place, with 13 each ;
while nine found Mr. Tait’s railways untidy but
useful as a means of exit. Of the murderers, four
adopted the late Othello’s method; three were
abortionists ; and drowning, shooting and poison-
ing give a little diversity to the record.

Said a Sydney de-
tective once to the
present writer:
“D’ you see those
three flash-looking
coves on the corn-
er? How would
you place them ? ”
After due perpen-
sion, I opined that
the straw - hatted
and cigaretted trio
lay somewhere on
the outskirts of
sport—horse-racing
for choice. “Right
enough,” said the
“demon,” “ to the
extent that, like all
their sort, they
punt a bit when
they have the
money ; but where
do you suppose they
get that from ? ”
When he had told
me, I wanted to
know why he didn’t
arrest them if he
knew them to be
such. The “tec”
shrugged his shoul-
ders. “Can’t touch
’em as the law
stands. They’re not
thieves ; and, so far
as I know, they
don’t keep the
company of suspected persons. Certainly, one
of them—the dark, thick-set chap with the green
tie—has done time for half-murdering the unfor-
tunate creature he lives on, but that’s all there
is, legally, against any of ’em, so far. .. . Sydney
simply swarms with them. I daresay I could
point out to you nearly a hundred between here
and the top oj King-street.”

“ Star ” : The R. C. Church makes specific
announcement of the fact that for the future
mixed marriage will entail excommunication for
the Catholic bride or bridegroom, and will be re-
garded as wholly invalid. This means that in the
eye of the Church children born of such mar-
riages will be illegitimate so far as the Church is
concerned, and the parties to the marriage will be
“living in sin.” But while the Church may think
what it pleases on such matters, it roust not think
out loud. There are simple secular laws for deal-
ing with the man—layman, priest, or bishop—
who alleges that a decent married woman is inde-
cently single, or that her children are otherwise
than absolutely legal. The Church will have to
step lightly on the subject as if it were leaping on
eggs. It is difficult to see exactly how a man or
woman can be denounced for living in a state of
adultery, withou t uncivil and defamatory remarks
being made. And a denunciation which is so
polite as to run no risk of defamation can hardly
denounce hard enough to blow a fly off the altar.

THE OLD STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A returned Australian declares that society in Melbourne
has merged itself into a number of sets, each of which
considers itself the most superior, according to its own
particular idea of superiority ; and these, according to
the lately-arrived critic, turn up their noses one at the
other.— Melbourne Paunch (lh/l/’O9).
The matron who is sternly mild, a pattern of urbanity,
A pearl for never getting wild, and dead against profanity ;
The dame who doesn’t dash or damn, nor walk beyond a
well-bred crawl,
Why, let her murmur, “ Yes, I am by far the naicest of
them all ! ”
There is a limit, she forgets, to blends of “form” and
piety,
We know that ours, of all the “ sets,” is really high
society.
Oh, all our nicest families, we find—our aristocracy,
You know—are prone to use the wheeze of “ Yes—the
poor snobocracy ! ”
What though the butcher-nobles bounce, and shove good
birth against the wall,
Though splendid, soap-made kings denounce the well-
born, haughty crew who call
Kings down ; though proud beer-lords express their bored,
august satiety,
And scoff at better men—still, yes, you know you’re “ in
society.”

The colored brother is on velvet in a whole
heap of quaint ways in , the Gold Land. Says a
J London exchange of last month :
At Wimborne yesterday Prince Jitendra was summoned
for having driven a motor-car to the danger of the public
at Sturminster Marshall. The prosecution is a sequel to
a collision recently described in these columns.
Mr. Staple Firth, for the prince, said that as his High-
ness was a suzerain prince to the King, that Court had no
jurisdiction to try him or carry out any verdict which it
might give for or against him. If they made an order
against him, the order would not be effective. The King
was exempt from any Act, and also any ruling prince
under him.
The Bench desiring sworn information that the de-
fendant is the son of a reigning prince, the defendant
took the oath, and said he was the eldest son of the
Maharajah of Cooch Behar.
The Bench decided that they had no jurisdiction to
decide the case.
The United Kingdom teems with sable Mahara-
jahs, Jams, Princes and the like, especially during
the polo season. A goodly number of them live
most of their time there. It must be a painful
thing for the British hind to know that, if the
person who motor-hogs him happens to be an
Indian potentate or the relative thereof, the honor
of the experience must suffice to cancel any
damage done to his (the hind’s) person or property.
In fact, it is enough to make even an English
yokel start talking Alien Exclusion in a loud
whisper.

The latest murderous outbreak of negro
King, the unholy terror of Pentridge (Melb.) gaol,
seems to have been the indirect outcome of the
Burns-Johnsing business. After the irrepressible
nigger had been overcome by a strong combina-
tion of warders, he-said “ When I fight, I fight to
win.” This was a few days subsequent to the
triumph of his colored brother Johnson. Some-
body must have acquainted Mr. King with the
fact that brother Johnson had
fought to win. Therefore he
burst into song and asserted
his pride of race.

NEAR-SIGGTED
OLD GENT
(irascibly):
“ Damn
these spires !”
Two years ago N.S.W.’s Carruthers Minis-
try conceived a scheme for supplying water to
Blackheath and Medlow, on the Blue Mountains.
A large dam holding 70,000,000 gallons of water
was built. This dam is now slopping over,: and
the water going to waste, for when the authorities
began to lay the water pipes, someone discovered
that you can’t lay water pipes except to a munici-
pality. Blackheath is only part of a shire, and so,
until it is gazetted a municipality, the water will
continue to slop over, and the inhabitants con-
tinue to depend for drinking fluid on the occa-
sional thunderstorm. It seems a pity that the
legal point was discovered before.the pipes were
laid. The Government would then have Bad a
fine chance to furiously proceed against itself in
the courts and recover Gosts.
“ Troides ” : A glimpse of a
great Melbourne detective at work.
The scene was a dingy, uncared-
for-looking boarding-house, in an
upstairs room of which a poor
little faded woman, the wife of
a wharf laborer, had been found
lying doubled up on the floor
in a pool of blood. The
police, several myrmidons
of the “ C. I. Branch,” and
this Grand High Sherlock
himself were investigat-
ing. That is, the others
were standing outside the
room of death, pale and
trembling, and he was cross-
examining the woman’s hus-
band, A reporter entered.
This reporter had, in the course
of his business, interviewed
Judges, actresses, and had even
spoken to volunteer colonels
without fear. Perhaps he
failed to treat the great detec-
tive with sufficient reverence.
Three trembling subordin-
ates crept down. ' “ Hush ! ”
they whispered, “The Mas-
ter is upstairs.” The in-
truder heard the rich, fruity
voice of the sleuth : “Now,
sir; be careful, sir. It’s no
use telling lies to me, sir.”
“ So help me Gott,” replied
the suspect, “I don’t tell
some lies already pretty
kviek.” The Master wrote
this statement down in a
notebook. “ Answer me, sir.
Have you been drinking to-
day, sir?” “ Perhabs I haf
some beers, perhabs I don’t.
Yot it madder?” “That is for
ME to say, sir,” thundered the
prodigy, taking down the answer,
and adding a note, “Prevarication!”
For an hour he asked similar porten-
tous questions. The reporter began to
get tired. One of the minor ferrets went
into the sanctuary, bowed, and said ‘‘Newspaper
feller outside, sir.” “Ha!” The Master, who
hadn’t got anything out of his suspect, saw an
opportunity of showing his greatness. He came
outs upon the landing, and so terrible was his
aspect that the unfortunate reporter fell at his
feet. The policemen-in-waiting also prostrated
themselves. “Now sir,” he said, “I cannot ’ave
you interferink with my work, sir. lam inter-
ror/atink a suspect, sir.” The terrified reporter
fell down stairs in his fright, and the pale sub-
ordinates pretended to look for bloodstained
bootmarks on the wall. At the bottom of the
stairs the reporter was dragged out into the street
by the inmates of the house. When he recovered
he got the : story from a small boy, who seemed to
know a good deal more about it than the Master,
and went away to write it up.

The London jury which sat last week on
the bodies of the victims of Hefeld and Jacob,
Russian anarchists, urged the coroner, according
to Reuter—
to draw the attention of the Home Secretary to the
danger to which the country was subjected under
existing conditions governing the admission of aliens.
London and provincial juries have been making
this sort of request to coroners ever since the
writer can remember, and of late a little—but not
enough—has been done in the matter. Whenever
Europe or America gets too hot to hold a chronic
dynamitard, he comes to England, and there he is
usually at peace. Soho is full of revolutionary
aliens—long-haired, insanitary lunatics who
sleep with knives between their teeth
and melinite bombs under their 'pillows,
and in other respects behave like the half-
witted plotters of bellowdrama—and, by latest
advices, they are slopping over into the postal
districts on the “south side of the water.”
Rightly or wrongly, the Continental peoples hol'd
this up against Britain. It is a curious fact that,
for years and years, no attempt has been made on
the life of any member of the British Royal
family in the United Kingdom. Rulers,
objectionable and otherwise, and innocent rela-
tions of rulers, have been mown down in
considerable numbers over the Channel. But in
the United Kingdom the Anarchist has ever held
his hand. The Continental nations say that the
British police deliberately give harborage
to regicides on the understanding that there
shall be no regicide in the land wherein the Bull-
dog breeds. There is no doubt, according to
reputable French and German papers, that the
majority of Anarchist schemes that have come to
fruition in late years were hatched in London.

Thus the Oldest Inhabitant:—
A more dismal function than that of the N.S W Bar
bidding farewell to Chief Justice Darley on Thursday can
scarcely be conceived. A funeral would be a comedy to
it. J went because, in November, 1873, I witnessed the
farewell function at Alfred Stephen’s retirement and was
present when James Martin was sworn in. The Stephen
adieu was given in the old Banco Court, and there was
no restriction upon the public. People were admitted
without comment, and mingled with the wigs and “-owns
On Thursday, the janitor, civil but stern, said that his
instructions were to “ admit only a few barristers ”
Presently the jolly, rubicund, genial Moriarty came along
in wig and gown. He was promptly blocked, much to his
astonishment, and retired apparently very much annoyed
Soon there were several barristers, with the representa'-
tives of the press and a couple of camera fiends all
stopped in the same fashion. Mr. Darley’s extreme
ideas as to the government of “ his Courts ” were being
carried out. After some delay the janitor sent for
instructions, with the result that barristers only were to
be admitted. Then the sub-Sheriff came along and he
graciously ordered the gallery to be opened to the mere
public.
Apropos the new Banco Court, it was built on Mr
Darley’s suggestion, on the lines of the King’s Bench in
the Four Courts at Dublin, where Mr. Darley had fre-
quently carried an empty brief bag. Now, the Dublin
Four courts were erected in a time of trouble. There is
a great rotunda, and the courts have entrances therefrom
Kacb doorway is small, so that two armed men stand-
ing in the stuffy entrance could hold a mob in check
while the Judge Jeffreys of the time escaped by the back
way. Mr. Darley’s court, built on this suffocating Irish
principle, was simply as a Turkish bath on Thursday.
Within the court everything was sombre. Four
Supreme Court Judges attended, the pair of Simpsons
being prominent, not to say glaring, by their absence
Four minor Courts” were visible-Heydon, Gibson and
Backhouse being away. Of 14 King’s Counsel on the roll
only four—Wade, Reid, Ralston and Shand—put in an
appearance. Of the retired Judges not one turned up
•p h f7 c ou>d not forego their hohday even to bid fareweli
to the Chief.
HIS LAST
CARD.
“ Wake up, you’re talking in your sleep!"
“ Well, am I never to speak in the house at all ? ”
Adelaide is in the throes of a burglar
scare. Between January 1 and 23, 14 safe rob-
beries, etc., occurred. There is no clue extant in
the case of any one of them. Despite a £250
reward, the slayers of Constable Hyde are still at
large. In the Flynn inquiry last week McLach-
I vn, counsel for Flynn, assured Inspector Priest
that a “wanted ” might lunch with the policeand
never fear recognition. When Lawson, of Block
14 robbery fame, was questioned by the Commis-
sion regarding the police denial of the presence of
Sparks in S.A. at the time of the robbery, he
asserted that he knew a “wanted” who walked
the Holy City streets for 17 weeks, despite the
fact that the law was pining for him both in Vic.
and S.A. Adelaide possesses 179 cops, but a cop
that doesn’t cop anything seems as useless as a
John Hop who doesn’t hop after the malefactor
or a John Dunn who has never done anything.
They do amazing things at Broken Hill
these days. Lately a man elbowed or shoved a
constable. Later John Flynn was run in, and
one bobby identified him. Flynn’s reply was that
he was on picket duty at the time, and that it
was a case of mistaken identity. An officer of
the union swore that Flynn was on picket duty at
the tiriie. Eight witnesses swore that he was on
picket duty at the time. The town librarian
didn’t know whether Flynn was on picket duty
at the time or not, but he swore that he did
know that the man who shoved the policeman was
not Flynn, because he witnessed the incident.
Then the magistrate said he believed the one
policeman, and alleged that it would be £3 or a
month. Now, if Wade’s Law Department has a
penn’orth of faith in the wisdom of Wade’s P.M.
it should prosecute eleven different persons for
perjury, and then listen to the thud of itself fall-
ing in. Probably it hasn’t enough faith to prose-
cute even one person.

“ Hassan ” : Just now all the small boys
of Melbourne are busy losing kites on the tele-
graph wires. A month ago the little girls were
drawing fearsome propositions on the pavements,
and playing hopscotch therein. Still earlier both
sexes were spinning tops, and, at the end of the
football season, the game of marbles was in full
swing. And these games come in with the utmost
regularity. It is not as though one kite appeared
ifl the suburbs and others followed. One day the
sky is clear, and the next it is, as an Italian
friend in the police puts it, “stiff wid
the dahm t’ings.” Any little boy, however,
who flew a kite in October would be shunned
by his fellows. It would be un-British. Kite-
flying is not a sport which is confined by natural
conditions to any particular month. Marbles are
played during the cold weather, and must chill the
knuckles considerably. But probably because the
kids in the “Mother Country” play marbles in
August and fly kites in January, ours carry on the
habit. What puts the top, or hopscotch, or kite
virus into their blood at any particular season is a
mystery deeper than that of the birth of a hero of
melodrama. But the fact is another evidence of
the cyclic and automatic theory of human life.
ON THE SCARCITY OF SHOPWALKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are complaints in Melbourne of a great scarcity
of shopwalkers. “We find it extremely difficult to secure
men with the needful good presence and nice manner,”
says the manager of one large concern, with houses in
several suburbs.
What’s coming to our splendid race ?'
What ails the men of British birth ?
This damning fact we have to face,
This ominous and galling case,
That, whereas once the men of worth,
So tall and graceful, wise and kind,
Were common, now we canno.t find
The soul of dignity and grace
To murmur : “ Forward to the lace ! ”
That man who walks the shop must be
Superior to the common herd,
A suave Adonis, not too free,
Bland pattern of gentilifee,
With always just the proper word
To fit the weather, and a smile
That never wearies mile by mile.
No stunted fop, no lumbering ox
Should guide a lady to “ the socks.”
The draper’s heart is filled with dread
The grim alternative he scorns,
A “walker” who is under-bred,
Or bandy, or has hair of red,
Or walks absurdly, racked with corns.
But all in vain the masters mourn.
Shopwalkers to the manner born,
The products of the present age,
Now air their talents on the stage !

SWAGGIE (bewildered): "Say, is there anything
funny-looking ’bout me ? Them*fore's ’ve bin
starin' at me ever since I passed by that pub."
LOCAL RESIDENT : “ That's just it, mate. It's
'cos you passed it by."
“ Jeach ” : Yes, I met one of those “ Way-
farers,” though I did not know it till I read your
description of the new order of converted travel-
lers. He was bullock-driving, and after he’d
broken his whip handle, split the welkin, torn his
hair and burst his trouser-seams, he knelt down
and repeated the “Wayfarers’ prayer.” It’s a
powerful prayer, sir, and calculated to remove
sandhills. I camped with him one night, and
after I was rolled in I heard him sing the “ Way
farers’ Hymn.” It’s a real Australian bush hymn,
but I don’t think it was arranged for use in
churches. If The Bulletin is taking names for
our future capital I beg to nominate the follow-
ing : Gorsavia, Billyeanberra and Yassphodel.
“ Itan ” : What a poor sort of struggle
the aborigines are putting up against the un-
e mquerable movement of evolution, which fore-
d loins them to early extinction ! A decade or
tvo ago the moralists used to make reckless
charges against Rum and a couple of other gentle-
men of the same bottled family. But it is
quite clear that grog was, at the worst, only a
hastening influence. Recent experiences prove
this, and also prove that the tide of ex-
tinction cannot be stemmed. The north
coast of N.S.W. was the most thickly abo-
riginaled part of the State. Half-a-century ago
there were hundreds of petty tribes thereabouts.
Now it would be exceedingly difficult to muster
500 of Binghi all told between Port Macquarie
and the Tweed and back to the tableland. Of
late years the police hate been strenuous in their
supervision, so that the decadence cannot be
entirely attributed to drink. The festive shearer
or riotous timber-getter of the old school would
sink more liquor in a week’s spree than half-a-
dozen of the luckiest blacks would get in a year.
The missionaries have had their chance too. The
aboriginal’s bump of religion is an insignificant
mound. He’ll be anything, if there is an extra
feed or a stick of tobacco to be squeezed out of the
mere profession. Not long ago a Roman Catholic
missionary visited a small settlement on the
Clarence River and christened the whole
lot without any ado. Another brand of
religion had been in the habit of con-
ducting services amongst the remnant, and
it fumed with indignation. So next day it
counterblasted the R.C. ceremony by marrying
the couples in orthodox Protestant fashion,
although the niggers had all gone through their
own matrimonial ceremony, which included the
cutting off of the first joint of the gin’s little
finger. The wounded sect felt easier in its mind
after that. Then the niggers, who had got some
cake and turkey twill out of the business, sat and
gazed earnestly down the road in the hope that
some more religion might becoming.

“ G.S.K.” writes
As the writer of the par (B. 15/10/’08), re the use of the
bicycle by shearers as a means of transit, I would like
to reply to “Sr.” (B. 21/l/’O9), who alleges that my yarn
is grievously in error. First, let me draw his attention
to the all-important fact that my statements related to
shearers travelling Out-back, in places where there are
no parcels offices for the lame bike to go to, no welcome
trains for the traveller to fall back on when the hike jibs,
and no swampy roads to cause the bike to shy. The
sulky is little used in those parts mainly owing to the
circumstance that horse feed must be carried in the
sulky, and can only be obtained at places hundreds of
miles apart. Also water is too scarce, unless you can get
a non-drinking horse—the Government tanks are over 40
miles asunder. The exorbitant price of feed beyond the
Darling is a sufficient bar to the use of the horse and
sulky. “Sr.” should see the country referred to, and
then he would be convinced that it’s not a place to expect
water up to a sulky’s axle, except in exceptional seasons
that are about ten years from one another, and even after a
deluge this country dries up in a couple of days owing to
the absorbent propensities of the ground. No, “Sr.,’’the
horse and sulky, from the standpoint of practical utility,
are not in it with the bicycle, which carries all that a
shearer requires in the shape of swag, tools, a day’s
tucker, and a water-bag.

“ Dandalup ” : lie speed of bush fires.
“Milky White's” whirler (B. 14/l/’O9), which
propelled itself along at the rate of one and a half
miles per hour, must be a very tired member of
the Blazing Snail family. In dry country a bush
fire will travel, almost invariably, at the same
velocity as the wind ; while, in green bush, the
flame will hurry along at from half to three-
quarters the rate of the wind. In support of my
first statement, allow me to produce the
great Gippsland fires in the latter
’nineties. Eye witnesses state
that the flames rushed along
as fast as the wind, licking
at and frizzling up every-
thing they touched. Many
a time, they say, the Fire
Demon flashed through the
bush, green and otherwise, at 30 or
40 miles an hour. Often his flight was
along the tops of the trees, and the under-
growth did not ignite till some time after he had
passed over. Out on the great plains of the West
I have seen the beast swishing along in the wake
of '‘Cock-eye Bob” at a tremendous rate, and
many a vain-glorious, fleet-footed emu has had his
tail-feathers singed by the rapid conflagration.
I’ll back an Australian Never-Never blaze against
the best outsiders the world can produce.
* * * m
The sudden, discordant yelp of “ O.” :
This is about the time of the year that the correspon-
dent with the vivid imagination and the long words and
the brilliant descriptive power writes about the bush fire
on the mountains and the ruin that it 1. aves in its wake.
Phrases like “ the devouring element,” “ scenes of deso’a-
tion,” “ lambent tongues of flame,” and such expressions
are working double shifts, and are nearly sweated to
death.
I’m on the mountains now. I don’t see any desolation.
I see the bush look better than ever it did in my experi-
ence before. The fact is that the trees and shrubs on the
mountains like to be burnt 10 a certain extent. It in-
terests them and gives them new life and courage.
During the last few years there were many fierce fires.
That’s why the mountains look so well now.
There are some beautiful gums in the grounds of a
house about half way between Sydney and Watson’s Bay.
An old gardener was burning off the grass one day a year
or two ago, and one of the trees caught fire as Twas
passing on a tram. I jumped off and told the gardener.
He said it was all right; he knew about it; it was good
for ihe tree. Then he threw some dry sticks and
withered grass on the flame. That tree is growing
splendidly at this moment.
Suppose there were no bush-fires for a few hundred
years, how would the Blue Mountains look? In a dry
season they would be one vast mass of sandstone, without
a vestige of vegetation, for grass and herbage can’t stand
the drought. Any good botanist—Mr. A. Gl. Hamilton,
for example—will tell you that the seeds of many of our
plants will lie dormant for years, and will germinate only
when subjected to fire. Indeed, when nurserymen wish
to grow these plants, they burn the seeds or fry' them.
When, therefore, in the course of time, the mountain
vegetation died of old age, in the absence of fires there
would he nothing to replace it.
Please don’t let me hear any libellous remarks about
the bush fire in future.
A LAST BEQUEST.
DYING PARENT : “ Nhow, Dan, afore I lave yez, oncet an ’ for all, if yez don't mend the fince
afore the funeral I'll give yez such a batin' as yez never had in all yer loife."
“Surcingle”: Tom Willis, in the new
annual volume of the N.S.W. Agricultural So-
ciety, alleges that Australian horses do not dete-
riorate. The advance in price may be somewhat
likened to that of English hunters. The finished
article there used to be worth from £7O to £BO at
the most. Now a first-rate hunter may run up to
£lOOO. He has advanced from a three-quarter
bred to a six-eighths thoroughbred. When the
Australian remount price went up from the same
cause, the shoe began to pinch the dealer. Aus-
tralia was the dealer’s paradise when large
holdings of land were the rule, and the
cost of producing horses was consequently light.
Charles Baldwin told Willis that in the early
days of his Durham Court the cost of feeding a
horse was about a penny a year. A good bush
brood mare was worth about £5 and a blood stal-
lion £5O. Their produce in good horses was sold
at from £5 to £l2 each, at five years old. The
dealer for India got £45 for remounts, and up to
£lOO for chargers and
private orders, out of
the superior bush-
breds. Low prices for
horses continued till
about 10 years ago.
The Boer war opened
upabigmarket. Then
came the Russo-. Tap
disagreement. Since
then there has been
a more or less steady
horse demand for
Japan, the Philip-
pines, the Straits
Settlements, the
Dutch East Indies
and China. In addi-
tion to the foreign
trade, a large local
demand has arisen.
Where there was one
man in Sydney 40
years ago able to give
£2O for a pleasure
horse, there are now
plenty willing to give
£lOO. The Indian Government buyers set an
arbitrary low price, with annoying red-tape con-
ditions, and then trumpet forth that the Aus-
tralian horse has deteriorated. Their price of £45
in Calcutta means from £2O to £25 for the breeder
at this end, and he will get £3O from the buyer
for Japan or G'hina. Willis is sarcastic on
Colonel Goad, who descended on Australia
from India with condemnation of our horses.
The display of horses at the last Sydney Agricul-
tural Show was a complete answer to the cavillers.
With all their measurements one would think the
Indian buyers knew more about the drapery trade
than about horses. In the Sydney show, of 1100
entries, every class was well represented except
the thoroughbred. The reason is not far to seek.
An ordinary thoroughbred stallion is worth from
£3OO to £6OO a year, while a top-notclier can earn
up to £2OOO. No necessity to worry with showing
them. They are judged by the racing records.
There are 50 stallions of unimpeachable pedigree
in N.S.W. alone. Their second-class sons become
sires of cavalry and saddle-horses, and cost from
£2OO to £5OO. The progeny of such cannot be ex-
pected at cat’s-meat prices.
Hobson’s Bay has been invaded by a
school of sharks, and the blue blunt nose of the
adult man-eater is now poking into all the favorite
bathing places along the shore. The other Sun-
day afternoon a motor picnic, composed of a few
conspicuous citizens, a few theatricals, and si
bunch of xnen who were merely people, spread
itself in the ti-tree just beyond Black Rock.
Later five ordinary men, one actor, and one
prominent citizen went in to get externally wet.
When he had emulated the giddy flounder out in
the ripple for a few minutes, the prominent
person was horrified to find himself nosed from
behind by something that seemed to swim quickly.
He went head under, bit a mouthful out of
the sea, and came up, gurgling and half-
blinded with brine, to discover a dark
object looming through the wave. Then he

saw his latter end right there, and open-
ing his mouth to yell was gagged by the Southern
Ocean, After that, the prominent one began to
drown in real earnest, but presently, finding his
feet on the bottom, ho started to canter ashore,
yelling like a fiend. “A shark ! a shark ! ” he
shouted, and blundered into the dry sand, allout.
“It bit me ! See, the brute bit me ! ” gasped the
prominent person, showing a wounded shoulder,
and the whole picnic laughed. “ Why, man, it
was your own dog !” said the comedian. Faithful

A RHYME FROM MULGSLAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In solitudes remote this place is,
Where nothing much save empty space is,
A mole that on Australia’s face is.
In deserts old ;
A wild auriferous oasis
Where men seek gold.
They’re men of might, these mites of men,
Who dare the drought fiend in his den,
And scratch like some assiduous hen
In desert dust,
And have hard battling, now and then,
To raise a crust.
Existence to a rough bush-whacker,
With money tight and times grown slacker,
Yields little more than long hard yakker,
From year to year,
With luxuries of beer and ’baccer
By way of cheer.
When some success our bonds has riven,
We seek fierce joys, for which we’ve striven,
The world’s harsh dealing unforgiven,
With fasting savage,
By man’s compulsive passions driven
To spoil and ravage.
In some saloon, with some fast filly,
We sing, “ shout,” fool, flirt, sane or silly,
And paint the town till, dazed and dilly,
With drinking, girling,
The world seems one vast willy-willy,
‘ About us whirling.
The memory of times we’ve tarried,
The chances missed, the schemes miscarried,
The golden girl we might have married
Ohe summer time,
Are dagger thrusts but badly parried
By jingling rhyme.
Let Fortune pout and prove uncivil,
And turn away, what need to snivel ?
She’s but a statue on a swivel,
She’ll come round smiling.
Meanwhile with rhyme I fool and frivol,
Dull hours beguiling.
Australia’s sun is in my veins,
Her spirit in my being reigns.
Whatever penalties or pains
Fate for me nurses,
The love of her a joy remains
Through all reverses.
I picture her, superb yet slender,
A Queen in all the radiant splendor
Of womanhood, grave, gracious, tender—
Myself a wooer
Whose strong desire is yet to render
Some service to her.

F. 0. Robinson, Proprietor
“Vigilans”: Apart from birds and fish,
Australian bush game is poor eating. In my
wanderings I have eaten nearly everything—
kangaroo, opossum, bandicoot, porcupine, emu,
iguana, snake, crocodile and grubs. Kangaroo
rat and bandicoot make the best dishes, whether
baked in the oven or stewed. Porcupine tastes
like chicken. Iguana’s eggs, if taken from the
animal, are decidedly good. Carpet snake put
me in mind of an insipid fresh-water fish. Croco-
dile is horrible, and so are emu and opossum. In
Kimberley and the Northern Territory there is a
large white grub from three to eight inches long,
with a pair of sharp nippers in its head. It is found
in dead and rotten trees. These grubs, cooked on
the ashes, are excellent; they taste like rich
cream. The best meal I have had in the wilder-
ness was off a plain turkey, and the worst off an
iguana cooked on cowdung in the centre of the
tableland of the Territory, where these was not
enough wood to boil the billy. Amongst herbs,
fat-hen, when boiled, makes a good substitute for
spinach ; pig weed, either cooked or raw, is palat-
able;-and a diminutive cucumber grows thickly
on the plains of the Territory and is not bad
eating. The wild fruits are all very insipid and
mostly stone.
UNPROFESSIONAL.
J. BROKER STONE : “ Will you help a poor devil
out of a hole, sir ? ”
MR. COFFIN OAKE : “ Preposterous, my man.
I’m an undertaker! I put people into holes.”
“Oby ” : There is no great sense in firing
junks of rough English at Tom Austin, Chirnside
and other sports for introducing the rabbit to
Australia when, as a matter of fact, official tables
show that bunny came out with the first fleet and
figured on the first live-stock return compiled in
Australia. The “ Account of Live Stock in the
Settlement ” (1/5/1788), compiled by Andrew
Miller, Commissary, by direction of Governor
Phillip, gave:—Horses 7, head of cattle 7, sheep
29, swine 74, rabbits 5. Of the five rabbits three
were entered as the property of Governor Phillip
and two as belonging to officers.
A RARE EVENT.
VISITOR! “I suppose your husband often gets drunk!”
MRS. BOGGS: “Oh, no! Only every Saturday and Sunday.’’
“ Boswell ” : With all due respect to
“Agricola,” I fancy that the slaughter of the
laughing Johnny by the magpie during the breed-
ing season is by no means general. Certainly it
may happen that while an old patriarch jackass is
sitting absorbed in thought on his favorite branch,
the sharp mandibles of an irate mag may be
suddenly driven into his chest with fatal results,
but that would be an exceptional case. Also the
old chap was pro-
bably deaf, for an
attacking mag makes
a furious, slithering
noise with his wings.
No doubt the mag
is a raving lunatic
during breeding
time. He then im-
agines that every
living thing has de-
signs of burglary on
his premises, and
attacks alland sundry
without respect to
persons. Indeed, I
have often known
cases where it be-
came necessary to
shoot an exceptionally
demented mag. beside a
bush track or road in order
that children going to school
might escape his unfriendly
intentions. The spur-winged
plover is similarly constituted.
But apart from nesting time,
I am convinced, from ocular
experience, that Johnny is the
boss bird of the Australian
bush. Observe a number of
magpies picking up the scraps
round a bush camp. An old
crow swoops down, and they
abandon their food with cries
of terror. Just as the crow
is securing it Johnny takes
a hand. He charges the
crow full steam ahead, and
implants his strong beak
under the dusky one’s wing.
The feathers fly and so does
the crow, with a hoarse
croak of despair, leaving
Johnny master of the field.
Then John quietly picks up
the disputed chop bone, flies
up to his vantage point, thumps the trophy
several times to make sure that it is dead, and
gets whatever sustenance the wood-cutter has
left clinging to it.

Bathurst is starting early to keep up the
centenary of the crossing of the Blue Mountains
by Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth, in 1813.
At a recent meeting of the Progress Association
it was resolved that all Western towns be invited
to join in the celebration. It was on Tuesday,
May 11, 1813, that the three explorers, with four
servants, four horses, and a heap of dogs (five, to
be strictly accurate), also with provisions, ammu-
nition, and other necessaries, left Blaxland’s farm,
at South Creek, to attempt a passage over the
Blue Mountains, between the Western River and
the River Grose. They crossed the ford on to
Emu Island at 4 p.m. On the first day they were
accompanied by two gentlemen, but history does
not name them. On Sunday; June 6, they re-
crossed the river, after breakfast, and dined at
Blaxland’s farm, having travelled to the foot of
Mount York. To-day it is still a question whether
Blaxland or Lawson was the leader.
There was a young man of Gladesville,
Who folks said was incurably ill;
But he’s now well and sound,
Here’s the cure that he found—
Laxo-Tonic — a wonderful pill.
LAXO-TONIC PILLS, 10Jd. and Is. 6d.*
They are telling a story of Paddy
McNathan, the sporting publican, that when a
certain Milesian bruiser came to his town on a
mission to mop up the Australian middles and
heavies, and make a pile in the process, Paddy
took to him like a brother. Slanigan, the
bruiser, was given the run of the house. He had
small cash, but his credit was unlimited. Paddy’s
faith was so great that he stood to him for a grand
supper, to come off in the hotel after Slanigan’s
great fight. McNathan believed there was
nothing Australian in it with his protege, and
for a month only Slanigan was talked in
his bar. After the fight, Paddy McNathan
arrived home sooner than was anticipated, and
in a heated condition. “Clear up them
things,” he yelled. “There’s goin’ to be no
supper here. Get out o’ me house ! ” He barked
at a few early guests and they fled. It was an
hour later when a faint knocking was heard on
the outer door. “To the fiend wid you ! ” roared
Paddy. The knocking was repeated. “ It’s me,
Mr. McNathan,” said a feeble voice, “Mike
Slanigan. I’m stoppin’ here.” “Be hill, you are,
then,” raved Paddy. “ Ye’re stoppin’ there till
yeh pay me bill.” Slanigan had been donkey-
licked in two rounds.
“ W.G-.H.” from the Westralian way-

Fully 80 per cent, of the laundry work in Kalgoorlie
and Boulder City is in the hands of Monkey, Ape and Co.
Taking into consideration the professedly democratic
spirit prevailing among the workers on the fields, this is
a staggerer. I have heard the man who complacently
hands his “ biled rag” to the Jap for treatment discourse
blatantly on the necessity for a White Australia, and
enthuse over the Alien Immigration Act. Still he gives
underclothes to the baboon washerman to launder rather
than to his own countrywomen, probably because he saves
2d. on the transaction, or, more probably, because he really
hasn’t brains enough to see that he is encouraging the
evil he denounces. Curse No. 2is Ali Gunny Bhag, who
competes with carriers, enjoys almost a monopoly in the
gardening business, and in general makes himself a most
smellful and sinful pest. His quarters are generally close
to the town, and his filthy and insanitary hovels are the
best possible argument for a White Australia. In a good
many instances he has taken unto himself a white woman
(and probably torn the marriage-tie to pieces in the pro-
cess), and the result is often to be seen in a motley collec-
tion of brats playing outside the hovels. If the miner
were told that a scheme was on foot to dispense with him
and transfer his job to cheap Asiatic labor, there w'ould
be Gehenna to pay. Yet he sees nothing inconsistent in
bestowing his custom on an Asiatic, who is ousting White
Australian competitors. It is surely up to political
leaders and heads of unions to impress these facts on the
rank and file, and after a time self-respect will do the
rest.
Pimples, eruptions, blotches, scales, ulcers,
and eczema are all caused by bad blood. Chamber-
lain’s Stomach and Liver Tablets are wonder
workers in the cure of all disorders caused by bad
or impure blood. They eliminate all poisonous
matter by enriching the blood and enabling it to
make new and healthy tissues. Pure blood means
perfect health, and if you will use Chamberlain’s
Tablets they will give you good health, and a pure
clean skin free from pimples and blotches.*
When the Victorian country kid hasn’t
cow on his soul, there is orchard produce to weigh
it down. Thus at Mildura (Vic.), whioh is a
warm spot m summer time, the local youngster
devotes himself to fruit-picking. His pa is very
often a fruit-grower, and, as the fruit ripens just
on or a little after the nipper’s Christmas vacation,
the parent thinks it is proper, as well as economical,
to be the sombre gentleman who always finds
something for idle hands to do. Therefore he
sets Willie grafting in the orchard, in a tempera-
ture that often overworks the meroury. But pa
doesn’t mind, as Willie is almost equal to a man,
and hasn’t the effrontery to request a man’s wages.
Moreover, in order to make sure that Willie’s
holidays do clash with the fruit-ripening season,
Willie’s pa connives with the Government at
Melbourne, and also with the local Board of
Advice, which comprises quite a number of pas
who strongly sympathise with the hard and
dreadful lot of Willie’s pa. Then the crowd—
Willie’s pa, the Board of Advice, and the Mel-
bourne Government —conspire to arrange Willie’s
recreation in the orchard. A lot of the fruit
doesn’t ripen until February, therefore Willie’s
furlough is prolonged until February. If it were
not so prolonged his poor father would have to
find a job for a man. So there is something to be
said for Willie, though little can be said for his
father, except that after this season he stands in
great danger of having to hire labor.
“ Oby ” : Re a vexed question which has
lately cropped up again, there is no historical
doubt about the Rev. Richard Johnson having
fully recovered what he expended in the building
of his wattle and dab church at the intersection of
Hunter and Elizabeth streets, Sydney. G. B.
Barton, Henniker Heaton and others present the
case as though the chaplain, finding that Phillip
would not build a church, conferred the blessing
of a tabernacle on the community out of his own
official salary of 10s. a day. It is true that in
July, 1793, he started men to build, but the
structure was not only the first Australian church,
it also constituted the first ecclesiastical scandal.
When the reverend architect sent in his account to
the Government the items were objected to on
the direct allegation that he had doctored the
accounts and falsified the bill. Here was the in-
voice presented by the chaplain for the erection
of Australia’s first church :
Paid 20£ gallons of spirits, 116 cwt. flour, 18Jlb. pork,
35Jlb. beef, 51b. tobacco, 31b. tea. Total value, £l4 9s. 9d.
Paid in dollars, £59 18s. Grand total, £74 7s. 9d.
Lieutenant-Governor Grose valued the spirits
and other commodities at £7 145., and said that
the original chaplain was trying to take the
young colony down for £6 15s. 9d. He emphati-
cally refused to pay. Johnson, however, appealed
to the Colonial Office in England and pulled
wires there till he collected his bill in full.

“ Cict ” : Where lies the true cause of
that depraved taste so frequently displayed by the
current foal? Not in the sex, the breed, nor yet
in the age of the brute doth it lie, for I have
descried the mother or the mate of the youthful
equine of all ages, sexes and breeds practically
destitute of tail-hair, the result of insane chawings
by the baby horse. Moreover, the youngster’s
absurd mastication of mother’s hair is not con-
fined to any particular month or season of the
year, but breaks out at all times. The victim of
the senseless attack is not always the severest
sufferer, for Moke, junior, quite often succumbs
himself after a prolonged bout on stolen plumes.
And, further, what maniacal instinct urges any
staid old hack to Submit to such indignity as this,
as neither his appearance nor his fly-flail’s handi-
ness are improved a whit ? The reasons handed in
AT THE SMOKE-NIGHT.
“ And I’m sure, gen't men, that it’sh shin-
shere wish iv ivery friendsh here thatsh pre-
sent thish evenin’, that the name of our
honorable candidate will be hounded downsh

in explanation of the infant’s vagary are most
numerous and variegated. My nearest cocky neigh-
bor says it emanates from lack of salt-feeding,
while the next cove just over the way says it’s due
to neuralgia, and a third diagnoses the disease as
consequent on worms. Several horsey books and
papers I have perused lay the charge to the door
of starvation, while our pub-keeper swears it’s
just pure cussedness. But why the full-grown
quadruped tolerates the consumption of his rudder
foliage no one explains at all.
THE WOODOARTER’S DOG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He knows the deeply-rutted roads that end in a splay of
tracks
He knows the twists in the winding oaths that lead to
the new-made stacks
And he loves the sound of the grumbling wheels, and the
clip of his master’s axe.
He also knows, as the old horse knows, the points of the
highway’s code,
As he lopes along in the heat and dust in the shadow
cast by the load—
For he wouldn’t stay at home, not he, when the cart is on
the road.
Though it’s thirty miles to the town and back he does it
all with a will,
And jumps to hearten the toiling horse when they come
to the long, steep hill ;
Or he hikes through a fence for scent of a hare, for lie
cannot bear to he still.
When the curs rush out from the roadside homes and
yelp at the passing dray,
He shows the set of his ivory fangs, and they’ve nothing
more to say—
He sinks his head with a savage snarl, and the mongrels
slink away.
For, being always a business dog, he hasn’t the time to
fool;
He may hail the tyke with a neighbor’s cart, but he’s
quite reserved, as a rule —
Somewhat distant to larger dogs, and to small ones
rather cool.
But his soul unbends in the great free bush when he
follows the twisting tracks,
For he loves the crash of the falling trees and the smell
of the new-cut stacks,
The grind and groan of the rumbling wheels, and the
clip of his master’s axe.

OUR PROHIBITION TOWN.
[For The Bulletin.]
In a cosy nook by the bay it lies—
The dreamiest spot on all God’s earth -,
No more the shouts of men arise,
No jovial laughter speaks of mirth.
Slowest of all that is slow and dull,
Ringed by the grey old wasted scrub—
Only the scream of the white-winged gull
Sounds o’er our township without a pub.
And this you will find when they put down beer,
That joy goes forth and is seen no more ;
All is solemn and cold and drear,
And the thistles grow by each cottage door.
The swaggies even refuse to stay,
And the drovers, with stockwhip’s great hubbub,
Pass thro’ the bog-lands, a mile away,
Sooner than ride by our shuttered pub.
But some day, mayhap, shall the Devil come—
And he’s bound to come with a fiery thirst—
And he may, in his search for a good, strong ruin,
Upon our dead little township burst;
And may I be there when blood is shed,
And, casting mercy to winds afar,
May I assist to pound the head
Of the parson crowd that closed our bar !

Andrew Turnbull, who died lately at
Braemar, George-street, Windsor (N.S.W.), in his
75th year, was a pioneer worker on the Hawkes-
bury and Nepean Rivers. In the middle or centre
or stomach of the ’sixties of last century he super-
intended the fixing of the piers of the old bridge
over the Nepean at Emuford. He and his partner,
the late William Dixon, built the bridge over the
Hawkesbury at Windsor. Many other bridges
and public works in the State were constructed by
Andrew Turnbull. He started the Emu metal and
gravel industry, of which concern he was managing
director up to the time of his death. Turnbulls of
one kind and another were settled on the Hawkes-
bury in the early ’thirties of the old dead century,
and probably at an even earlier date.
A “ STICKER ” FOR WORK.
Several others with strong and bitter feelings against
the law came forward, one of whom—a lady—said that if
she had six good women behind her she would undertake
to tar and feather Mr. Wade.—DAILY SILLYGRAPH.
If the Premier is at all the man we think he
is, the mere fact of his being tarred and feathered
will not interfere with the ordinary performance
of his duties.
In the last big Broken Hill strike, when
the leaders were arrested for conspiracy, they
sought the late C. C. Kingston’s help as counsel;
but Kingston couldn’t act —he was only a member
of the S. Acs. Bar. In this present trouble it was
Paris Nesbit, K.C., to whom the unions first
turned after Tom Mann and the others had been
arrested ; but Paris Nesbit had to shake his head
for the same reason. Then “ Jim ” Gannon was
called for from Sydney.
Mr. J. Hume, of Collingwood, Gunning
(N.S.W.), underwent an operation in Sydney and
died on Wednesday, January 27, aged 53 years.
The daily press said that he was a descendant of
Hamilton Hume, the explorer, which is scarcely
correct, as Hamilton H. died without issue. The
deceased was the eldest son of James Kennedy
and Annie Hume, sister of Hamilton the ex-
plorer. He adopted the name of Hume when he
inherited the property of Kennedy Hume, who
was murdered by bushrangers at Gunning in 1840.
When Mr. F. M. Darley accepted a seat
in the N.S.W. Legislative Council (September,
1868), he was asked by a relative if he had no idea
of trying to enter the Assembly. And the awful
imported person replied that he could not think
of mixing with the class of men which was there.
In the Legislative Assembly in 1868 were Arnold,
Stephen Brown, Wm. Forster, Isaacs, S. A.
Joseph, Dr. Lang, William McLeay, Parkes,
Robertson, Saul Samuel, T. W. Smart, the two
Suttors (the elder ones), Windeyer, Wisdom,
James Martin, etc. And all these men shocked
Darley’s finer feelings, and gave him the cold and
elevated shudders down the back.
“ J.,” about a peer who is now dust:—
The Earl of Leicester, whose death was cabled last
week, had other claims to fame than his descent from Sir
Edward Coke and his Lord-Lieutenancy of Norfolk. He
was the greatest expert in the science of covert-shooting
in tiie United Kingdom. When he got too old to shoot
himself he continued to take a delight in directing bird-
massacres on his Norfolk estate for the benefit of his
friends. At organising these affairs he was unsurpassed. A
friend took me once to look on at a big shoot at Holk-
ham. The doomed fowl were pheasants. All the morning
the keepers and their under-strappers, in their white
smocks witli colored collars and wristlets, had been tap-
tapping on the trees with sticks. When the “guns”
took their stand outside a certain high-placed clump of
trees every pheasant on the estate had been shooed into
the undergrowth, nearby, ready to fly over and be shot.
This was the triumph of the old Earl’s manoeuvring.
Ranged in line in the hollow below the trees were half-a-
dozen of the best shots in England. Behind each man
stood loaders, with ammunition and extra guns. At a
given signal, a loud tap was heard, and the gorgeous
birds began to whirl madly over. There is an idea
abroad in this country that pheasants are easy to kill.
They aren’t. I have tried it, and I have seen others —
crack local pigeon-shots—try and fail miserably. It is a
special art, like the spot stroke at billiards, or Brother
Johnson’s way of being a Methodist. The way these
crack shots performed at Holkham was marvellous. It
was not so much that they practical]! 7 never missed, but
that they killed, grabbed fresh guns from their loaders,
and killed again with such astounding quickness. For a
brief time the air rained dead pheasants; they crashed
to earth behind the shooters in scores, in hundreds, in
thousands. The rare days on which these affairs came
off were the golden ones in the life of the old peer who
passed over last week. The only thing that really
maddened him was when a guest missed or merely
wounded one of his fowl. It is said that a
new-comer was shooting at Holkham once when
he observed a keeper jotting down notes in a
pocket-book. On cross-examination the servitor owned
that he was keeping tally of the guest’s misses, also of
the number of times he smote his bird on its tail or other
non-lethalpart. The total was to be submitted to “his
lordship” in the evening, so that the latter might judge
whether or no he would ever suffer the culprit to shoot
on his property again.
Westoalia’s queerest old cuss dropped out
of Parliament recently. He was very small
potatoes in the House, but he is a big
man up in his district, of which he owns large
patches. His few contributions to Hansard
were brief and to the point. “ All yous can
go to ’ell,” he informed a ribald Opposition
on one occasion. Whereupon a rude mem-
ber asked —if that was the destination of the
ewes, what would become of the wethers ?
The old gentleman’s most celebrated speech
was.in advocacy of the .Circuit Court sys-
tem, not then in vogue in the West. Like
most great speeches, it was a model of
brevity. “I reckon we oughter ’ave some
circus courts up our way,” he said ; and
dropped into hisseat again. Though he was
a shrewd business man, malicious old inhabi-
tants say that he used to keep his books by
drawing diagrams on the wall.
Tommy Bent assisted in celebrating the
jubilee of Brighton (Vic.) the other evening. He
pointed out that in 50 years Brighton had pro-
gressed from bullock drays to electric trams.
Brighton has also progressed from a horseback
postal service to wireless telegraphy. But it has
clung to Bent. It couldn’t well help the electric
trams and the wireless system, but it could help
Bent—and it didn’t.
“ B.” : Frank Anstey, the Victorian Labor
member, who broke down and wept copiously in
public because the railway men had promised to
vote for Watt, is a very emotional man—a mere
bundle of nerves. Were it not for this he would
probably be leader of the party, for his ability
and sincerity are recognised by everyone who
knows him. Anstey has had a very hard life
of it. He ran away to sea as a boy, and
endured the hardships of life before the mast for
many years. In his nomination paper he described
himself as a laborer, but as a matter of fact he was
caretaker at the Working Men’s College before he
got a much harder job in Parliament. Anstey is
a convinced Socialist, and one of the most extreme
men in the House.
From “ Melb.,” who has a habit of
bedecking his screed with capital letters :
Our Hangman, Mr. Smith, has been sent by the magis-
trates to the local Bedlam. He is a Mister, not a crimi-
nal. Said the Police : “He suffers from delusions, your
Worships ; People following him about.” Bench: “Oh,
Ah, yes! Men he has hanged.” Police: “No, Your
Worships, not at all. He imagines that Young Girls are
following him about and teasing him. He threatens he
will make an example of one of them. It is pure delu-
sion.” In short, our Scragger has fancied himself in a
continual state of St. Anthony. It was feared he would
take some innocent girl, and string her to a beam. Smith
kept a little Tuck Shop in Carlton. Good ladies would
say, “You must find it hard to make ends meet.’’ He
would say, “ I gits a little bit of a job now and agin.”
Nobody had the faintest suspicion what the job was. A
little girl thought she saw him going into the gaol. This
caused a rumor that he was in the Government employ,
and won him extra respect. Mrs. Boltrope has a shud-
dery remembrance of having once talked to him about
“The Pore Man as was’Ung this marnin’.” Said the genial
Smith, “ Oh, Mum, it’s nothink like so crool as you’d
imagine. All depends on the official who officiates. If he
has a nice soft hand, and a soft cord, it’s no more than a
ship gently sliding off the stocks.” The morning news-
papers mention that Smith was a Spiritualist, and
attended stances, where he was ever welcome, being an
excellent medium. This, and not scragging, led his
mind astray. When the hands were all laid on the table,
at Madame Empyrean’s, everyone used to remark on
what peculiar hands Smith had. His was a full hand,
large, massive and clammy-white, the most spiritual that
anybody ever saw. He would glance up at the ceiling,
and sigh out: “ I wonder where we goes to when we’re
gone.” Then a fishy eye would wander round the necks
of the ladies and gents, present. The first Melbourne
hangman on record was one-eyed Bamford. Then came
a Caliban named Gately. Next, Elijah Upjohn—a sug-
gestive Heavenly-Chariot name. After this the authori-
ties decided that the Hangman should not be known.
Several have thus passed away without figuring in the
chronicles of glory.

Though Chief Justice Darley had resided
in New South Wales for 47 years, yet the sale of
his effects drew attention to the fact that Aus-
tralian books and pictures were conspicuous by
their absence. One view of Sydney Harbor
adorned the walls, and Australian "literature
was represented by “Convict Once” and
one book by “Rolf Boldrewood,” who, by the
way, is the Chief’s brother-in-law. Darley’s suc-
cess in avoiding anything Australian approached
the marvellous.
Of late years Victoria has had frightfully
bad luck with its hangmen. First there was
Jones—steady-going, sober-sided .Tones—who
figured on the Government’s pay-sheet as “a
messenger.” He cut his throat in a bath at the
Melbourne gaol, rather than put the late Mrs.
Ivnorr through the drop. His successor collided
with the Law, of which he was an unobtrusive
ornament, through an undue fondness for short-
skirted damsels of flighty habits. And now Smith,
the last of the line, has been relegated to a lunatic
asylum.
Mr. W. Cox, Humffray Street, Ballarat,
Vic., writes : “I have been a great sufferer from
rheumatism, and having obtained the greatest
relief by the use of Chamberlain’s Pain Balm I
cannot speak too highly of it. Whenever I feel
the rheumatic pains coming on, I give the affected
parts a few applications and it always arrests the
attack. I know several people who have used
Chamberlain’s Pain Balm, and they all speak in
the highest praises of it.”*
The CRESSBROOK ESTATE. —In our advertising columns
will be found a notice with reference to the sale of the
third section of the famous Oressbrook Estate, which
will take place at Toogoolawah on Saturday, 6th March
next. The section for sale will include 8000 acres of the
best land on this well-known station, notably the great
plain paddock on the eastern bank of the Brisbane River,
access to which is being provided for by the erection of a
substantial bridge. The plan shows 52 farms, varying in
areas from 50 acres to 705 acres, most of the choicest
portion being subdivided into small blocks, so as to give
all persons a chance of securing a homestead. The
character of the lucerne land on the Upper Brisbane
River is too well known to need comment, and the
exceptional advantages offered by the Oressbrook Estate
should attract buyers from all parts of the States. The
Nestle and Anjrlo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company are in
full swing on the estate, and are paying at the present
time upwards of £ll,OOO per annum to suppliers, at the
rate of from sjd. to 6d. per gallon. The railway station is
right on the land, and the terms are up to 20 years with
interest at 5 per cent. An illustrated pamphlet and
plan is obtainable from the auctioneers, Isles, Love & Co.,
Queen Street, Brisbane, or from the local agents, Hugh
Duff & Co., F. E. Pulsford, Wilson Anderson & Co., 88

Melbourne people are remarking of the
recent police “raid” on the clairvoyant tribe
that Mrs. Rising, the high priestess of the cult, has
been carefully omitted from the bunch of cases.
Mrs. Turner, who comes next to Mrs. Rising in the
estimation of Believers, was prosecuted and fined
£lO and Costs for revealing to a bachelor police-
man the whereabouts of his non-
existent wife—but how about Mrs.
Rising ? She’s the lady who can reveal
all mysteries at a price. David Syine
used to consult her about his business
enterprises, until her predictions had a
run of bad luck and David’s faith
weakened. As a medical clairvoyant,
she enjoys a splendid practice, and
her power of peering into the interior of
a patient who has forwarded her a lock
of hair by a third party is a matter
of common knowledge—in spiritual-
istic circles. Outside of those circles
the stories of Mrs. Rising’s failures
are many and humorous. Her
methods of fishing for information
from her clients are no different
from those of the 15 men and
women whom the Melbourne
police brought to court. She’s
an impudent, abusive old char-
acter when a disgusted client gives
the lie to her occult babble, and if
the police want evidence against her they can
get miles of it without laying any new traps.
But if she were prosecuted, she would call a
number of well-known men for the defence,
and they don’t want to be well-known in this
connection ; therefore Mrs. Rising will be able
to pose as the old original genuine clairvoyante
to whom the Lawtook off its hat.
“ Singemoine ” : The Steinheil affair now
agitating France in general and Paris in particu-
lar, has resulted in the assassination of a Name.
Madame Steinheil, who is accused of murdering
her husband and her mother, is one of those dear,
irresponsible matrons whom anyone with 1 franc
50 centimes to spend may meet between the
covers of a Gallic novel of passion. She appears
to have had a whole academy of lovers, and they
all combined, with the full sanction and approval
of M. Steinheil, to keep the domestic pot simmer-
ing. Occasionally, as a matter of form, Steinheil,
who was an artist, painted one or other of the
lovers, and got a big price for the work. Evi-
dence given at the trial last month went to show
that Felix Faure, the last President of the French
Republic, was one of the binned and loved. Said
Steinheil to a friend a while before his death :
I will tell you something, but keep it to yourself.
Felix Faure was Mme. Steinheil’s lover, and she was with
him when he was struck down. I beg you do not repeat
what I tell you. lam already worried sufficiently about
the letters (f.e., Faure’s letters). I don’t know what my
wife has done with them. Mv mother-in-law said to me only
the other day that the best thing would be to send them
back to the proper quarter. X don’t know what has been
done. Anyhow, it is all over between my wife and myself
since this affair. She may have two or three friends, or
more, if she likes. As you become old you become
reasonable.
Faure was to all appearances the typically
righteous bourgeois. He had no discernible vices
barring a love of food, and a still greater love of
crowned heads. The disclosure of bis lapse has
occasioned the Parisians much delight and sur-
prise. They dance merrily at the wake of their
old idol’s reputation, and refuse to be uncomfort-
able.
DAVID STORRER, M.H.R., OF TASMANIA.
“S.” : I saw Frank Anstey do his grand
breakdown and bathe the platform with tears at
Newport (Vie.) the other day, and it was the
most effeminate and hysterical display I have seen
in 30 years’ experience of politics. The speaker
was explaining that his inquiries convinced him
that a great number of the railway men were
going to vote for Willie Watt and against Labor
candidate Fenton, and the floodgates suddenly
opened and Anstey wept. With his face buried
in his hands he sobbed aloud. The gathering of
brawny iron workers and carriage builders re-
spected the orator’s great sorrow, but it is sur-
prising that the tearful fit did not provoke a storm
of derision. I remember when “Mint-Sauce'’
Jones wept at Ballarat. He never got another
hearing throughout the campaign. But “Mint
Sauce” was weeping over his own political funeral;
it was Fenton’s funeral that made Anstey break
down.

listen, while I, Mann, descant on your miseries!
List, while I belch out a proud defiance in the face of the
“ Fat Fifty ” !
Gaze while I hurl a hissing curse, red-hot, in the paunch
of the Proud and Portly,
And laugh, my friends, with a wild, demoniac laugh,
while I grind out a grim anathema and gird grue-
somely at the crawling myrmidons of beleaguering
Capital.
For I am the Breaker of Chains, the proud Champer of
Bits, the Eternal Rebel who yelleth, “Arise and
Rend ! ”
A born jaw-warrior am I ; jaw-potent, jaw-valiant—a
wild wielder of the weapon of Samson i
Unto you I say, “Awake, O slaves, smite them hip and
thigh ! ”
Unto Paunch I say, with fiery iteration, “Away!
Avaunt! Absquatulate and aroint thee ! ”
And if in due time he do neither “ avaunt ” nor “ aroint ”
himself,
Then sink I down distraught in the pub of a sordid son
of Pelf
And drink with flashing eye the foaming ginger beer of a
proud and haughty freeman 1
Am I not, now as ever, prepared to fight—even to the
death—with a dire and deadly jaw ?
Prison I fear not; troops I defy ;
Cannon, powder, bayonets, bombs—l say “Let’em all
come 1 ”
I, Mann, erst of London, erst of the beer-trade, erst of
many trades,
Erect I stand ; tweak the nose of the law ; jeer at the
sacred name of J.P. ; laugh at police ; gibe at the
military ;
And cast, at times, a pint of mud right in the Eye of
Authority !
Believe and believe me, O camerados—
There is but one Brotherhood and I, even I, am its per-
manent Prophet!
I am he who will assuredly save you,
But ask me not, camerados, for troublesome details.
It lies, after all, entirely with yourselves
And below is the modus operandi
Lift up the chain that hinds you, O bondmen,
Take it, rend it—break it, send it
(Shattered into a thousand shivering fragments),

The directors of this co. evidently believe that, if share-
holders get al5 per cent, div., they shouldn’t want any
information. Certainly they don’t get any to speak of
even if they do want it. The profit is shown “ after
deducting repairs and renewals, depreciation of plant,
and all other charges,” and there is no hint as to what
depreciation is thus provided for. Whatever provision is
made—that is to say, whatever revenue is put aside
ostensibly as a set-off against wear and tear and natural
decay—is no doubt put into plant, mains, etc. Ten years
ago the plant, mains, land, buildings, etc., which had
been charged up to capital account stood at
£1,036,257. The sales of gas, etc., brought in £174,475,
or at the rate of £33 13s. 6d. per cent, per annum on the
investment. (That, of course, is gross revenue.) In the
past six months £271,778 came in from a fixed investment
of £1,240,979 ; so the rate now is £43 16s. per cent. Put
in another way, the co. is supposed to have spent £204,722
of capital in 10 years ; and the increased revenue is at the
rate of £194,606 per annum. It is possible, of course, that
£204,722 of works may bringin£l94,6o6 of annual revenue ;
but somehow it doesn’t seem at all probable, particularly
as the extensions of mains, etc., would naturally be in
the parts which would yield the least revenue. No doubt
the old mains have yielded more revenue as population
has become more congested ; still, it seems highly prob-
able that, in order to produce the results mentioned, a
large amount of unmentioned profit has been stuffed away
into new revenue-producing works. Of course it isn’t
all profit that has been thus stuffed away; some of it is
a fair set-off against depreciation. On the other hand,
with a co. as old as this, when renewals are charged up
to profit and loss the amount required to be set aside for
depreciation isn’t very great; because the renewals that
are being called for to-day are as great in proportion to
revenue as they are likely to be 20 years hence.
Besides the reserves shown above, the Austra-
lian (Sydney) Gaslight Co. has—Premiums on new shares,
£232,227 ; reserve for replacement of meters, £19,133.
The paid share capital is £799,998 ; so, adding the pre-
miums to that, the total capital put into the co. is
£1,032,225. This brings down the 15 per cent. div. to
an average of 11J per cent. As to the future,
it is impossible on the published figures to be very
definite. On the fixed investment (that is, capital put
into mains, plant, etc.) it is clear that the gross revenue
is very much greater than it was 10 years ago ; but it is
impossible to say how much of that gross revenue is being
absorbed by extra costs, and how much is being stuffed
away into new plant, etc., in view, probably, of keener
competition from municipal electric lighting and power
by-and-bye. There may be very good reasons why the
management doesn’t want either consumers or the Labor
party to know its real position ; and it is to be heartily
congratulated upon the skill with which it succeeds in
telling nothing that really matters. Also it is to be just
as heartily congratulated upon being in a community
which allows itself to be kept thus in utter darkness.

Possibly the co. sold an extra quantity of gas while Mel-
bourne was showing Brother Jonathan’s Fleet around;
but making some allowances on that account, the growth
of the output is notable, and all the more notable when
the competition of the municipal electric-lighting and
power works is considered. Yet it is the sort of thing
that is to be expected. In 1907 there toed the mark in
Victoria 4210 bridegrooms whose usual place of residence
is the metropolis ; and, though here and there one house
is shut up when a new bridegroom goes put into the
world, in most cases marriage means an extra house to
demand a gas meter and call for a stove. Between 1891
and 1901—10 years—the population of greater Melbourne
increased only from 490,896 to 496,079; in the next six
years there was a spring to 538,000. No wonder the in-
vestor who thinks over these things is prepared to pay
£lO Ss. for shares which, 10 years ago, were valued at
only £7 2s.
The Melbourne Gas Co.’s reserves are made up
like this Premiums on shares, £466,535 ; formal re-
serves, £79,864 ; meter renewal fund, £21,454 ; undivided
profit, £2988. But there is probably a large reserve not
shown as such, and represented by works paid for out of
profit. Under the rotten N.S.W. Companies Act, which
in many respects seems designed to assist the person who
is out to fleece or fool the public, it is not necessary for a
gas co. to give any particulars of any consequence ; in
Victoria, however, the cos. are required to tell a lot, and
having to tell so much, most of them reckon that they
might as well tell everything. This co., therefore, shows
exactly what revenue it does spend on new works ; in the
past six years £152,847 has gone that way. With so much
new works paid for out of profit and not charged up to
capital, the profit on the works at the figure at which
they stand in the books moves up, of course :

Capital Account. Capital.
December, 1902 ..£2,152,788 £4 13 9 per cent.
December, 1908 .. 2,149,842 615 4 ~
Certainly all the £152,847 spent in six years may not be
true profit; some of it may be a set-off against wear and
tear and decay of other plant, mains, etc. But repairs,
maintenance and renewals are charged direct to profit
and loss. An exception is made with regard to meters :
the cost of renewing these alleged perjurers is provided
out of a special reserve fund, and shown above as written
off. Also the amounts carried to “ gas stoves account ”
are shown as written off. (This last is an item represent-
ing practically a subsidy to the users of gas stoves, which
are let out at a charge which isn’t in itself quite profit-
able.) The co.’s share capital is £857,210in 171,442 shares
fully paid to £5, and there are 28,558 shares authorised
but unissued. There is also a debenture debt of £798,000,
of which £460,000, carrying 5 per cent., will be repayable
1910-12 ; and over that transaction the co. can no doubt
see an annual saving of £4500 sticking out in the near
future.

Something is alleged to have been written-off to cover de-
preciation ; but there is no telling what it is. “Manufacture
and distribution of gas, rents, rates and taxes, renewals,
lamp-lighting, bad debts, depreciation, management,
etc.,” are all lumped into one item. If he likes to take it,
this gives the man who is inside a fine advantage over the
man who is outside. The co. may be either making a
great deal more profit than it is showing, and stuffing it
away under the cloak of “renewals, depreciation, etc.”—
putting it, in short, into new plant, mains, etc. —or it
may be barely earning its dividend, and making, no ade-
quate provision for the big renewals that will have to be
faced later on. If the management is adopting the
former policy, the insider will know that, presuming the
village doesn’t slump, an increased dividend or a distribu-
tion of shares at par is likely to come along presently;
if it is adopting the other policy, the insider knows fairly
well that a reduced div. is highly probable in the future.
In most cases when a gas co. so carefully hides its proceed-
ings it is assumed that things are better than they are
alleged to be ; the hiding is put down to the directors’
dread of telling the truth and awakening the municipal
devil. The assumption has panned out all right in a good
many cases ; bub there is an obvious danger in it, and
some day some group of investors will wake up to find
themselves the victims of the confidence trick. Under
these circumstances, before one plunges into any gas
co.’s shares, it is just as well for him to make friends with
some director or other who is allowed behind the
counter. With this co. a distribution of shares
at par was made during the year; and the capi-
tal is now £22,500 instead of £20,000, as it was 12
months ago. The gas-sales, etc., for the y ear totalled £8624;
that is, 34 per cent, on capital and reserves. In 1903 the
capital was £15,000; and the sales, etc., £4532, equal to
29 per cent, on capital and reserves. One assumption
from this is that Manly nowadays stays up later at night
to put oil on its sunburn ; but a more feasible one is
that the co. has piled up reserves which it doesn’t show-
in other words, has made undisclosed profits which it has
put into plant, more or less as a set-off against the de-
preciation of the other assets. The div. for the year is
shown as 9£ per cent.; that means 4£ per cent, for the
first half-year and 5 per cent, for the second half, and the
market is evidently assuming that the 5 per cent, per
half-year is going to last. The co.’s debts total £2197 ;
its liquid assets (before paying the half-year’s div. =£1060)
were £1778. In view of the rapid extension of the suburb
and the evident need for more capital, further calls on
the last issue of 10,000 shares, now paid to ss. (£2500), are
probable ; and as that capital will no doubt also bring in 10
per cent, (for a time, anyhow), these are calls that in-
vestors will welcome. The market has, however, dis-
counted all that, for the ss. paid shares are actually
worth 235., so that until the calls are made they will
bring in only £2 3s. 6d. per cent. Even after they have
been fully paid the shares will at that price bring in only
£5 55., working on the basis of a 10 per cent, dividend.

The pref. shares are entitled to 5 per cent. ; the others
get the balance. But, so that the deferred pref. and the
ordinary shares might get the benefit of it supposing the
writing down had been too severe, it was provided that
profits from the sale of written-down assets should go
into a special reserve for their sole advantage. This
special reserve is therefore not shown in the foregoing
table. The sales have mostly been on time-payment;
and as far as they have gone they have panned out like’
this:—

There has thus been a very rapid conversion of assets ;
especially satisfactory is the wholesale clearing out of
vacant and mostly unproductive land, in regard to which
the rate-collector makes his regular calls. On the
average total value of the properties in possession last
half-year £6 10s. 3d. per cent, per annum wgs realised
gross ; but after rates (£1031), repairs, and expenses were
paid, the return dwindled down to £3 14s. per cent. The
money as it comes in from sales is going into new ad-
vances : and very good progress is being made in that
direction too. Apparently 7, however, there is no rush of
fixed deposits. Yet the security looks quite good
enough. The co. owes in all £335,100. Deduct the
liquid assets, £47,836; balance, £287,264. Against that
there are the properties, advances, balances, and pre-
mises shown above, totalling £517,979. And the pro-
perties at any rate have been written down below market
values, judging by sales so far.

This little bank, which keeps itself to Ballarat, and is the
only institution of that English type in Australasia,
works away very largely on its own money. For every
£1 of its own, it holds in deposits, etc., only just 30s. of
the public’s. Its liquid assets are £88,636 ; the debt to
the public is £240,743. Deducting the liquid assets from
the debt, there remains £152,108 of the public’s money ;
and, apart from bank premises, there are £312,122 of non-
liquid assets. That is a very comfortable position
for depositors to be in; assets would have
to be very rotten if, on the average, they
didn’t pan out at 9s. 6d. in the £. Of course
profits couldn’t be high in a business of this
nature unless it went in for loans at high rates on poor
security. In that case, though the profits would be high
sometimes, they would be liable to be cut down below
zero at others. As a matter of fact, even if this bank’s
profits are low, they are very uniform (of course, there
may be internal reserves to regulate things). In propor-
tion to capital (£85,000) and reserves, recent results have
been: —
June, 1905 ..£5 6 lp.c. June, 1907 ..£5 6 1 p.c.

The accounts otherwise show no movements of any con-
sequence on the 12 months. Liquid assets are a little less,
with a corresponding reduction of deposits ; but the bank
has still 37 p.c. of its debts in cash or Govt, stock.

In issuing its present accounts this co. does for itself what
an attempt is made in the current number of The Lone
Hand to do in a general way—to show, that is, what an
estate has to pay for having its trustee work done by a
professional trustee co. which has put up a money guaran-
tee that it'will go straight, and won’t either die or run
away. This co. takes an estate of £lO,OOO which will be
20 years in winding up, and shows that the total commission
will amount to £25 a year, assuming (1) that the income
averages 5 per cent, on the investment, and (2) that the
income isn’t rent (a higher charge is made for collecting
rents). The Lone Hand showed that a £25,000 estate,
yielding 4 per cent., and taking eight years to wind up,
would pay £825 in all, or Ss. 3d. per cent, per annum ; or
if it was a 40-year trust the payment would work out at
3s. 3d. per cent, per annum—a very small payment for a
great service. Of the £825 the corpus commission (that
is, the single charge on the capital value) would be £625.
This amount various trustee cos. deal with in various
ways. This co. apparently passes it over to a “com-
mission reserved acceunt,” and draws upon that account
gradually as the estate is wound up. The next table
shows the net results of the operations on that account: —

The amounts shown in the first table as written-off have
been devoted to writing-down the premises, which some
time ago were remodelled. They now stand at £16,000. The
estates in hand total £6,739,048. The gross income (after
transferring an unmentioned amount to the commissions
reserved account) was £21,671. Deduct an estimated
£2400 for interest on investments, and there remains
£19,271 = ss. Bd. per cent, on trust balances. That is
approximately the average cost to the estates ; and of
that about 4s. Id. goes in expenses, and Is. 7d. is avail-
able for profit and for writing down assets. The paid
capital is £25,000; shares are £lO each paid to 55., but
the rapid growth of the reserves is reducing the real
liability. So large, however, is the turnover in propor-
tion to capital that, though the investments no doubt
bring in only a small return, the capital and reserves
combined show a net profit of £8 16s. sd. per cent. Of
the assets £20,000 is deposited with the Treasury, £3OOO
is on fixed deposit, £16,000 is in premises, and £45,083 is
vaguely described as “ loans on mortgage and other in-
vestments.”

While a country is borrowing 4 , and money is flowing in
from outside, a fictitious affluence is produced ; and
prices boom. The immediate effect is just the same as if
the country discovered two or three Mount Morgans, or
had a succession of phenomenal harvests, along with
phenomenal prices. Later on, however, the effect is
different. If the inflow of borrowed money simply
stopped it would be bad enough ; but in addition to that
there is an outflow of interest, and in many cases the
lender wants his principal back, and these facts make things
far worse. The boom prices then start to shrivel; and the
pendulum is apt to swing just as far back as it swung for-
ward. Already this co. has to write off £l7OO “on free-
hold property which has fallen into the co.’s hands dur-
ing the year.” Evidently with a view to setting its house
in order, the co. has been busy reducing its advances and
strengthening its cash reserve, which latter was referred to
12 months ago as “ appallingly small.” this comparisoh
shows the position at Dec. 31: —
1902; 1907. 1993;
Capital and reserves .. .. £131,492 £149,634 £150,406

Book debts 4,691 5,816 5,420
Liquid assets .; .. .. 15,798 5,015 14,022
The liabilities, therefore, are a shade under £2 for every
£1 of shareholders’ funds ; in other words, the depositors
and other creditors are protected against a slump to
the extent of a shade over 6s. Bd. in the £. And
on top of that protection there is the shareholders’
uncalled capital of £5 per share. (There are only
250 fully-paid £lO shares out of a total of 20,000.)
The principal asset is described as “ mortgages and other
securities,” which isn’t a satisfactory way of lumping
things ; still it may be taken for granted that the “ other
securities” don’t include anything liquid. The propor-
tion of liquid assets to total liabilities is still much too
small, and if there is any demand for the deposits it is
at least possible that further amounts will have to be
written off on account of forced realisations; Nevertheless;
there seems to be no reason why therfe should be ally
demand for deposits; because the protection offered tb
depositors by the shareholders’ funds, paid up and un-
called, is very substantial.

The paid capital is now £200,000, the second 10s. per
share on the last lot of 40,000 having been payable oh
October 1 ; that £20,000 therefore only Carried three
months’ div. As a bonus of Bd. per share has been paid
on the whole 200;000 shares, actually the half-year’s div.
is more than 15 per cent, oil the Average ; because those
40,000 shares got £2500 for the Use of £40,000 for an
average of 4J months, which is a nice little return of 16 2-3
per cent. Of the very fine profits shown for the half-
year, £3550 has been added to the formal reserves—for
special repairs and insurance. But besides those appro-
priations, probably something has been wiped off revenue
direct, and used to reduce the book value of snipping. Two
new vessels are on the stocks ; a big one is almost com-
pleted, and a second smaller one has been started.
Also others have been improved. Yet the book value of
snips has only moved up in the half-year from £62,051 to
£69,829 —which, by the way, works out at the ridiculous
average of about £2lOO per vessel. This indicates how
severely the asset has been written down ; in other
words, to what an extent profits have been put into
steamers without being shown as profits.
The Sydney Ferries’ accounts can be summar-
ised this way:—

“ In view of the authorised capital being now fully paid
up, your directors propose,” they say, “ at an early date,
to submit a special resolution for increasing the same to
£400,000 ; but the present subscribed capital will not be
increased till actually required’’—which is to say, until
the directors can’t conveniently get rid of the profits
otherwise. And the investing public takes the hint and
pays 635. (ex div.) for the shares; so, in expectation of
favors to come, the investor is willing to pay a price which
yields him an immediate return of only £3 3s. percent.,
assuming that the div. is kept at 10 per cent. The extra
for the past half-year is distributed by way of a bonus on
account of “ specially favorable figures, chiefly due to the
visit of the American Fleet last August.”
It is worth while working out what return an
investor will get by the time the whole of the new shares
have been issued. Suppose they are issued at par—share
for share. The in vestor’s two shares will then have cost
him 83s. If the divs. are kept at 10 per cent., he will get
that much on 40s. =4B. per share=£4 16s. 4d. percent.
Of course, other things may happen. Some of the shares
may, for instance, be issued as bonus shares; of the pre-
sent 200,000 shares, 80,000 were issued that way (60,000
when the present co. was formed, and 20,000 subse-
quently). But assuming they go out at par, the present
price won’t return anything Very dazzling in. the way of
interest, even after what maybe a long wait. What it
may return to the man who buys shares to sell later on in
a favorable market is, of course, another matter.

It is an amazing document which this co. issues as a
report and balance-sheet. The profit and loss account
alleges—“ Net profit for the half-year, £3051.” Yet a
reserve fund of £lO,OOO drops into the balance-sheet; and
if that reserve f und isn’t made of profit, what is it made
of? Not premiums on new shares, for no new shares
have been issued. And it isn’t a repairs and renewal
reserve—in other words, a provision for the six months’
wear and tear —because special provision has been made
for that; the “plant renewal account” has been in-
creased during the half-year from £5500 to £9OOO,
which alone is nearly 12J per cent. per annum on the entire
book-value of steamers (except the Burrabra), freehold
and leasehold properties, works, plant, machinery, etc.
To the end of the half-year £23,134 had been paid on
account of the Burrabra ; at least, that much is admitted.
So the Burrabra has apparently cost £23,134, at least;
and all the other steamers stand in the books at £59,156.
From that it is perfectly clear that very large sums have
been written off their cost. This is the position as to
liquid assets :

to the visit of the Fleet, the past six months have been a
particularly gorgeous time ; but, apart from that, it .is
evident that, so long as this co. has the Manly traffic to

in the calculation of working costs in coneeii-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uHcod-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make fot
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously' at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity' of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent, rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

This co. stood out of the “honorable understanding” in
the coal trade when it was first fixed up ; but the co. and
the “understanding” are very good friends now. It
may be on that account that, though the coal trade in
general hasn’t improved, this co.’s sales of coal have in-
creased, and better profits are shown than for some time
past, barring one half-year. Nevertheless, there isn’t the
rush for the shares that there was : 12 months ago they
were put up close to £3O ; recently they got below £26.
Evidently the public found time at last to run its eye over
past records, and discovered how erratic they were.
Nevertheless the average div. for the past 10 years has
been 19f per cent., though if you go back only five
years you will find the average comes down for that
period to 14 per cent. The profits are only shown
net, after providing for depreciation ; and what allow-
ance is made for that isn’t mentioned, though in
connection with such a wasting security as a coal mine
few things are better worth mentioning. The co.
keeps in a very good position to buy other properties as
they offer; its surplus of liquid assets (including book
debts) over liabilities was £62,450 on December 31. The
other assets are lumped—“ Mining property, including
mineral lands, buildings, railway, rolling stock, pits,
tunnel, etc., £102,964.” If this stack were divided up, it
would be found that the co.’s surface or township pro-
perty is worth considerable ; and in that respect this coal
co. differs from most others in the same list.

Justice Higgins has gone to Broken Hill to hold
a Federal Arbitration Court over the Broken Hill Prop,
dispute. Without prejudging the case, it is hard to-see
how an Arbitration Court can award worse wages and
conditions than those which have been accepted by two-
thirds of the cos. working the same lode. What will hap-
pen then? Only the management knows for certain;
but the chances are that the ii. H. Prop, will make a very
leisurely start, and will then proceed to work the
mine on a limited scale, picking out the best
men offering and waiting for the metal mar-
kets to improve a lot before it bustles again.
The difference between what a first-class miner and
a second- or third-class miner can do is so great that if
it only finds places for the first-class men, the result will
be exactly the same as if it made a cut of 15 or 20 per
cent, in wages. The men will get the higher wages, but
the standard of efficiency will be raised several points.
In other words, the co. will get around the award (sup-
posing it goes this way) by making it apply to the best
men, and not to the average or under-average men.

There apparently wasn’t enough luck to divide
between Lobb’s Hole and Kyloe, the two copper shows in
the Monaro (N.S.W.), which cos. have lately taken in
hand ; and Kyloe managed to get the whole stock. As
fast as Kyloe has improved, Lobb’s has slid the other
way. Apart from its excessive capital its trouble is that
it has only a narrow vein in hard country ; and the country
has got harder and the vein narrower in the No. 2 level,
where something decent was expected. Therefore,
though the little smelter was only started on January
15, the campaign will last not later than the middle of
this month ; then the pot will have to shutdown and wait
for ore. Lobb’s was a very profitable copper show for the
small party which worked it for many years ; and that is
the sort of enterprise for which it is best suited.

The Barrier, Wyalong (N.S.W.), the best of a
number of properties controlled by a Sydney syndicate,
promises to yield several crushings during the year. The
shaft is down some 42ft. from the 400 ft. level-on high-
class mineral ore, while a winze 50ft. south of the shaft is
showing a mineral reef all the way running from 8 to 12
inches wide. It is intended to sink the shaft so as to
provide a lift of 100 ft., and then run a level to meet the
winze. The syndicate would do a wise thing when the
shaft has been sunk the required depth to drive north to
the Welcome Stranger boundary, as the shoot of stone
in the Stranger which yielded £19,000 worth of gold
down to the 180 ft. must be somewhere thereabout.
* * * a
“Straight Go”: The Bulletin, I see, still
regards the Queen Bee, Cobar district (N.S.W.), as a good
little mine, troubled by bad equipment. I have been
mining for 30 years, have worked at the Bee, and my
idea is that its real trouble now rests with the value and
quantity of ore. Manager Fox, a large shareholder, took
charge 15 month- ago. He promised big things, dividends
among them. The dividends haven’t come, and I think
the other promises are in the same basket. On the mine
are four reverb, furnaces and one small water jacket,
capable of treating 1120 tons of ore per month. Given
8 per cent, ore, this should produce 90 tons of copper per
month, or 45 tons of copper with 4 per cent. ore. Judging
by the smelting returns published, the plant has been run
at about one-half its capacity. Why? The only reason
a sane person can arrive at is that the ore is not avail-
able. No doubt it has been a rich little mine, but below
No. 3 level the ore decreases in copper value very
rapidly till at No. 4 level it is about 4 per cent. :
average width of lode, 4ft. 6in. At No. 5 level very little
ore is showing, and the winze between No. 4 and No. 5
levels shows a still further shrinkage in ore and values.
* * • ■*
“E.H.” writes: “Re Boppy copper mine
(N.S.W.). One month’s experimental work with differ-
ent kinds of concentrating machinery proved the com-
plete amenability of the ore to concentration with Wil-
fleys or similar tables, 2 per cent, to 4 per cent, ore
concentrating- up to 18 per cent., with o‘s per
cent, to 0’75 per cent, loss in tails. If this isn’t successful
concentration then tell me. The mine shut down be-
cause theco. hadn’t money to put in necessary machinery
for concentration purposes, not because experiments
failed. The ldwt. gold is in concentrates, not in ore. The
mine is still there, as sound a little copper proposition as
will be found in the State, and some one will make money
out of it.” Which last is the conclusion at which The
Bulletin had already arrived. But the shut-dowm of the
mine wasn’t caused exactly in that way. The trouble
was that the bank was dissatisfied regarding a certain
guarantee, as to which it said it had been misled. As to
gold contents, the mines inspector reported for 1907
“ The mine raised and sold 380 tons ore, containing 37
tons copper and 18oz. gold,” and the difference between
ldwt. per ton and 18oz. in 380 tons is too small to matter.
Still it admittedly was picked ore.
The Wellington district (N.S.W.) hasn’t bfeeh
feeling very well lately owing to the practical shut-up of
the old and once very profitable Mitchell’s Creek, and the
metallurgical troubles at the Commonwealth ; but the
Welcome Jack, near Wuuluman Creek, has tried its best
to keep up its end of the old field. The co. started in
January, 1908, with a paid capital of £l2OO ; and since
then £1475 has been paid away for plant, £750 has been
distributed in divs., and besides a reserve of £2OO there was
£202 in the bank when things were balanced the other
day. The co. issues along with its accounts a statement
of assets and liabilities. The assets include 3150 tons
tailings at 16s. (£2520) and 2000 tons ore in sight at 395.
(£3900); but whether that is gross recoverable value or
estimated profit isn’t obvious. If it is gross value then,
of course, there ought to appear on the other side the
cost of turning the assets into coin.

Westralian Minister for Mines Gregory held
forth on the greatness of Kalgoorlie in the Perth Parlia-
ment : “ There is no area in the world of the same dimen-
sions that is producing so much gold as the Golden Mile.
To the end of 1908 Kalgoorlie has produced
10,586,3240 z., valued at £44,967,846. . . . . Six of the
Kalgoorlie mines have to date paid in dividends over
£12,500,000 sterling.” Yes, but you can’t turn the mill
with the water that has passed. Some of the six mines
mentioned have now dropped out, and with the exception,
perhaps, of the Kalgurli no dividend-earners have shot
out to take their places. If Gregory was merely out to
boom things with a view to tickling some more money
out of Cohenstein, his yarn is understandable ; otherwise
he must have told it with his tongue in his cheek. When
Brown has lived to the remarkable age of 92, it doesn’t
signify that Brown has a long life ahead of him ; it only
signifies that of the total years of his life no fewer than
92 have gone ; and the more that have gone the fewer
there remain.

Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) is now estimated to
have 1,065,409 tons in sight, of a gross value of about
£2,700,000. Setting aside 275. per ton for cost of produc-
tion, and allowing a fair thing for losses in residues,
this estimate gives a “ profit in sight ” of somewhere
about 70s. per share. Previous year’s estimate was
1,062,332 tons, containing £2,765,084 gross.
* » • •
For the year ended September last Central and
West Boulder (W.A.) put up another remarkable per-
formance. The local expenditure—almost wholly salaries
and travelling expenses—was £638; and London got
away with £l4OO, three-fourths of it for directors’ fees
and secretarial services. Having farmed out one lease on
profit-sharing terms to the Oroya-Brown Hill, and let the
others on tribute, the officials have apparently decided to
enjoy a good time while there is money and opportunity.
Yet no one at the annual meeting seems to have raised
the slightest objection to the balance-sheet; and it was
unanimously adopted. It is amazing what J. Bull will
put up with. But when the co. is irretrievably on the
rocks, it will be Australia that those shareholders will
blame ; and in a few more minds this country will have a
black mark put against it.
* * * *
Central and West Boulder had £lOl6 in hand
when the year closed ; but, on the other side, the co.
owed £2045. The most promising feature of the year’s
operations was reckoned to be the discovery of a new
make of ore near the Associated boundary. An examina-
tion of this section indicates that “in all probability
something approximating 4000 tons of good grade ore will
be recovered from these workings ” ; but as the co. has a
bad record as a tipster, the public had better not place
too much reliance on this estimate. Dealing with returns,
the report mentions that since crushing was resumed
about six months ago 7398 tons have been extracted and
treated at the Oroya-Brown Hill mill for a recoverable
average of 18s. 6d. per ton. This left nothing for the
Central Boulder ; but how the Oroya-Brown Hill fared is
not stated. It may be taken for granted, however, that
the latter co. didn’t lose anything, as it is not the sort of
concern to work other cos’, leases for the benefit of its
health. And it is not likely to get into debt over them
either.
* * * *
The strike of woodcutters, and the consequent
shutting down of the mill, prevented the Great Fingall
(W. A.) from earning the shilling dividend just paid within
the quarter, but the Board made up the balance out of
accumulated profits. After providing for this distribu-
tion the co.’s cash resources, including bullion in transit,
amounted to a trifle over £90,000.
* • * *
Tindals (W.A.) still fails to inspire confidence.
When the new mill started and free drinks were handed
round on Nov. 21, good returns and early dividends were
predicted by the chairman ; but why has not the result
of the first clean-up been given out ? Is anybody ashamed
of the figures ? The silence, along with the report that
the property is deep in pawn to a well-known machinery
firm, and the fact that several ugly stories are now in
circulation about the stock, suggest that some inquisitive
shareholder should begin to ask questions.
* * * *
The Gold Finance Co. of London evidently
belongs to the Hope-and-Trust persuasion. Report for
year ended June last shows a loss of £5962, which is
mainly due to the slumping of large share interests in the
Cosmopolitan Proprietary and Bellevue. Both these pro-
perties are said to have “ good prospects,” but that is
what thev sav about every mining derelict.
* •" * * *
Mt. Yagahong (W.A.) inflicted another annual
report on its shareholders last month. Assets are alleged
to be practically unchanged ; but as these mostly consist
of shares in two played-out shows in the West and an
apparently unmarketable interest in a S’African diamond
mine, which doesn’t seem to be yielding diamonds, the
fact that they haven’t changed isn’t in their
favor. The co. still has a bit of money, and the
Board advises shareholders to “consider a scheme for
writing down the capital to an amount which may earn
dividends.” Shareholders had much better go the whole
hog, and have a division of assets right away. The his-
tory of this co. has been one of failure and ineptitude,
and there are no better prospects now visible.

The value of stone from the New Moon, Ben-
digo, got down last half-year to 4dwt. 10gr., making an
average of 4dwt. 20gr. for the year; and yet from the
£39,388 won the co. knocked out £9600 in divs. Most of
the stone comes from the big formation in the shallow
ground, where the direct labor cost is only ss. BJd. per
ton, including timbering. Total working costs for the
last half-year were £16,401; total revenue was £20,341,
leaving a profit of £3940. The co.’s revenue included
£1546 for public crushing, which is one of the mysteries
of Bendigo management, seeing that the co. has big
reserves of its own low-grade ore, which isn’t earning
anything as long as it is left in the mine.
* * * *
Porepunkah Dredging Co., Bright (Vic.), set
out on a capital of £5OOO, intending to make the mine
pay for its own development. The purchase of the land
was arranged on time-payment, and a dredge was got on
terms. Probably it wasn’t economical, and it isn’t a
system that could be worked on anything but a dredging
claim ; but in this case it is panning out all right. For
the land £lOOO a year has to be paid. The total debt has
now been reduced to £3908 ; and, besides land and plant,
the co. had £402 in hand on Dec. 31. In the first half of
last year the net profit was £1006; in the second half,
£1337. The dredge is eating up about 20 acres a year.
* * * *
Williams’ Fancy and Birthday Tunnel, Ber-
ringa (Vic.), fight for the lead in cheap work. The
Tunnel is now ahead with a record of 11s. Id. per ton,
against 11s. lid. by the Fancy. Its work is at 800 ft.,
against 600 ft. in the Fancy ; and 3s. 9d. per ton was spent
on development; against Jd. per ton by its neighbor.
The recoras in both instances are the best in Victoria to-
day. On 4dwt. quartz the Tunnel is paying 25 per cent;
of the gold won as profits, and is taking ldwt. for de-
velopment, other expenses being more than covered
out of the balance. What makes such costs possible are
big formations, with the gold easily recoverable.
■ft * * *
Portuguese Flat, Creswick (Vie.), is one of the
few good things “Ha, ha” Peacock has in his list of
mining cos. The co. is sluicing a Creswick old-time
rush, and on £B4OO spent has put up a plant, paid
for the lease, and dragged 52080 z. out of two acres of
ground. The face is deep, but the gold is all right. The
co. has got on to the div. list, and looks like sticking
there till the last bit of dirt is washed out of the flat.
•» * * •
The importunate South Star, Ballarat, is
wheedling the Victorian State Treasurer again. A bit of
slobber led Thomas Adolphus Bent to lend £6OOO to
enable the co. to go down to 3000 ft. on a lode that for
hundreds of feet had been as barren of result as a score
of Bent’s promises. The Bulletin measured up the
chances of that bit of work, and its estimate came out
right. It now predicts that if Jack Murray sanctions
another grant for driving a crosscut to the Albion lode
he w’ill help the co. to drown itself. Central Plateau,
next door, sees the danger, and is out with a hot protest.
Not alone that, but the Central is setting the Star the
right example by going out west into sound country to
sink a new shaft, with the object of picking up the lode
below' the old gutter. Such work will cost less relatively
when everything is debited up. There will be no water-
spout ahead to fear, and the facilities for opening up the
lode will be what a miner wants.
■*■***
Crown Lyell, having got its lease back, puts out
a report w'hich shows how sadly Tasmania wants decent
labor conditions for mines. No active work was done
during the past half-year. Yet the co. had money in
hand, because directors avow’ that the financial position
is such that mining operations can be begun. Work in
North Lyell, near by, has drained the country, so the last
impediment to sinking has gone. On this draining the
directors build up castles in the air by surmising that the
North Lyell ore body extends into the mine at depth.
Such a deduction is very pretty. By a parity of reason-
ing, the fact that the Tasmania mine at Beaconsfield has
drained the country for miles round should indicate that
the dozens of surrounding blocks contain the Tasmania
lode. But nobody is foolish enough to even suggest that.
Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) lias got its surface workings
and milling plant into better order, and the new manage-
ment can be congratulated on improved output, recovery,
and economy. During the half year 90,872 tons were
treated for 480 tons concentrates, giving 67£ per
cent, metallic tin. Thus it took 189 tons of
dirt to make one of concentrates, and still
there was a profit. Mining and milling costs came
down with a rattle from ss. 9d. to 4s. 3d., and the
smelting cost, calculated on dirt, is only a few' pence.
Total divs. for the half-year (£18,000) are equivalent to
nearly 4s. per ton of dirt. Considering the low average
yield and the weak and falling market, the ss. a month is
not too secure. Recent returns, however, indicate an
improvement, and any extra tin in the dirt will be all
“bunce.” The mine produced an average of 80 tons of
concentrates per month, so a profit of £37 10s. per ton
was required to equal a ss. div. (£3000). Such a big profit
on concentrates is enough to make every tin miner’s
mouth water, and to get such results out of some of the
poorest tin dirt in the Commonwealth is a notable
achievement.
» * * *
Bonnie Dundee, Charters Towers, crushed
523 tons for £2195, which isn’t up to expectations. The
returns from a small mine, worked for all it is w r orth,
are likely to see-saw'. Development in the two deepest
levels has also been in-and-out. Brilliant Deeps put
through 102 tons for an average of £2 Bs. lOd. The
foolish excitement caused by a few rich assays from a
diamond drill hole has now fizzled out, hut the Deeps
keep their solid backing because of the good develop-
ments next door in the Brilliant Extended. Charters
Towers is gradually entering an era of deep-level mining,
and the sinking of several deep shafts, such as the Queen
Cross, Mills United, Freeholds, Brilliant Block, and B. St.
George, also the proposed deepening of the Brilliant Ex-
tended underlie below 2800 ft., denote a wide range of
activity. The Brilliant Deeps are prospecting a reef split
into hanging-wall and footw'all sections at a vertical
depth of 2413 ft. The footwall branch is being driven
south-west on a make of mineral stone about 2ft. wide.
A call of 2d. is due on the 100,000 contributing shares.
New Brilliant Freehold’s fortnightly return was
£2401 from 447 tons, so the average is well maintained.
The December lot was £3846 from 709 tons, and the total
for last year, including tributors’ gold, was £17,514 from
3473 tons. Mills’ United, next door, got out £179,695 for
the year, and the Freehold will have to do a lot of de-
velopment before it can climb up to its big neighbor’s
output. Yet the market, with 20 years’experience of
the Day Dawn, values the Freehold at about £20,000
more. Sinking is not so rapid as was expected, but in a
few weeks the shaft should be deep enough, and No. 7
main level far enough advanced, to start crosscutting.
With so much development in hand the directors are
careful of the money, or probably a dividend would have
come before this. Mining and haulage are being done
under expensive conditions, so there is every inducement
to push on with the main shaft, which fortunately is one
of the best on the field. E. Mexican has better hopes in
consequence of another make of mineral stone 64ft. up
the rise from No. 6 level, and the fact, that some rich
stone was got from No. 6is not forgotten. Although the ■
past exploration of the Mexican has been disappointing,
there is still much unexplored country near the N. B.
Freehold’s boundary which may provide a pleasant sur-
prise.
The Herberton district continues to hold first
place among the producers of minerals other than gold
in Queensland. Mt. Morgan begins to forge ahead as far
as copper is concerned, but the lead so far does not
amount to much; for the last three months of 1908
Mt. Morgan produced 1263 tons of copper, against
Herberton’s 1206 tons. These two gave nearly
three-quarters of the output. Mt. Perry (434
tons), Oloncurry (406), and Rockhampton (239) were
the other important contributors to the total, 3695 tons,
which is 920 ton 3 more than in the last quarter of 1907.
The output of tin has gone back by about 300 tons ; but
silver, lead, and wolfram show big increases by the same
comparison. Three-fifths of the silver is from Herberton
district, one-sixth from Stanthorpe, one-tenth from
Charters Towers, and Mount Perry is responsible for
20,0000 z. of the total of 356,0000 z. for the three months.
This total is nearly 100,000 oz. more than in 1907. In tin
again Herberton has 643 tons out of 879, and
139 tons of the balance comes from Stanthorpe.
The lead output increased by 500 tons, but decreased in
value by £l6OO. Counting in the Thornborough district,
138 tons of wolfram out of a total of 141 tons were turned
out from the Cairns back country. The value of these
minerals for the quarter is given at £388,997, or £52,000
more than the last quarter of the preceding year. The
steady advance in production does not appear to have any
good effect on share-market business ; brokers all over
the State are finding business on the decline, and the
speculative element is badly in need of a pick-me-up.
* • * ■*
As they sink on it the Tommy Burns (N.Q.)
gets no better ; but some sort of an output is being main-
tained from the surface stone, though even there a good
deal of hand-picking is being called for. It seems as
though Dalziel’s were going to repeat itself—a wonderful
surface show, with nothing worth having underneath.
Shares, which were skilfully boomed up to £2O within a
day or two of the floating of the co., can be got now for
£6—and you don’t have to regard the business at that
price as a favor either.

cheerful; and everything hangs on that.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 2, 1909.
My Dear Artni
The steamer Empire—the same one which
dropped that amazing quantity of opium over-
board just outside Sydney Harbor—brought over
the two sons of Melbourne’s lion-headed Dr.
Bevan. Fortunately, it didn’t drop them over-
board also. Professor Louis Bevan—a pale-pink,
swollen edition of his father—is Professor of
International Law or Marine Agriculture or some-
thing at the Imperial University at Tai-Yuan-Fu,
or some such curried place, and the alphabet runs
after his name like Pharaoh running after an
Israelite. Another son is a churchman, and
teaches the young Chow idea how to shoot at
Medhurst College, Shanghai. They are accom-
panied by a wife and a small son apiece.
One of the fascinating youth of Potts Point
leaves his perch on the higher branches of the
tree of eligibles. He is Alfred Phillips, a young
widower, and he is to marry Constance, one of the
gilded and titled Benjamin tribe of Melbourne.
The event is booked for February 10, at Canally,
East Melbourne.
Captain Clive Dangar arrived from India via
London on the Mooltan. He has, in the artless
phrase of the military man, “ chucked the service
for good,” and proposes henceforth to devote him-
self to hard labor on the ancestral station. He is
of the Abbey Dangar clan, which is a clan of con-
siderable wealth. The Captain has abandoned a
cavalry regiment to take on the arduous job of
watching sheep grow wool; and the only solace he
proposes to allow himself is a motor car or two.
Matrimony is said to be at the back of this
tremendous resolve, and the lady, who is known
to Sydneyites, journeys Australia-wards later on.
There was an exodus of prominent folk on
Saturday. The Darleys, Admiral Moore and
Mrs. “Bob” Blackwood—one of Melbourne’s
smart dames —left in the Morea. By the Pericles
went the Batthyany nobleman, Mrs Innes,
two pretty Ryrie sisters (the family has sheep
stations up Monaro way, and labors under the
shame of having a member in the State Parlia-
ment), and the Walter Allens.
The Darleys put up at Mrs. Orr’s, in Macleay-
street —this is the one hash turret in N.S.W. at
which the haughtiest may stay and not dread loss
of social prestige—for the period between yielding
up Quarnbi to the Sep. Levys and clambering
with glad cries aboard the Morea. If anything
were needed to put the cachet of importance on
“52,” the Darleys’ action and appreciation of the
place would do it. Mrs. Darley is reported to
have said on leaving for the P. and O. wharf that
she “had no idea hash-towers could be made so
comfortable, and so like the houses of gentle-
folk.”
That pretty little danseuse. Miss Evans, who is
to marry her wealthy N.S.W. Adonis Binney next
month, is a wonderful result of how a “ given
name ” sometimes (but not often) fits. Consider-
ing the early age at which births and christenings
occur, few people make a success of the business.
Daisy usually grows into a globular angel of
14 stone, while Rose comes out yellow. But Miss
Fairy Zephyr Evans is as fair as a once-upon-a-
time princess, and her locks are of the Titian
breed, and her dancing is as light as the feet of
her second name when they waltz upon a hare-
bell.
The Macleod sisters are frockily back in Sydney
• —lounging in their city flat after astrenuous copper-
tinting at a surf-beaten beach. Toorak is to miss
their cafe and theatre parties for quite a while.
They depart for the Thames-side city in March,
with an interlude of two boats at Colombo.
Andrew Black’s pals from Paling’s, and other
intimate male friends, collected on Friday night
to tear a bit of food with Andrew at Paris House.
It was a Bohemian spree and limited to a round
dozen of guests. Andrew warbled some moonlit
songs, but took no alcoholic part in the proceed-
ings. The remaining eleven upheld that feature
of the programme. When the hours grew small
they chased the bridegroom off with cheers.
Mrs. Forsyth, who knows, according to horsey
folk, more about horses than any other half-dozen
women in N. S. Wales, has come Sydneywards
from Newcastle, where she abides, with a curious
contraption. It is an enormous caravan—the sort
the stage gipsy who kidnaps the missing heir
affects. That is to say. it is the gipsy sort in
general conformation. In all other respects it
differs from that humble conveyance. The For-
syth vehicle is of a most gorgeous appearance,
being mostly shining brasswork and yellow paint.
Four horses drag it about the country side, and
the lady herself drives them as only she knows how.
Somewhere stowed away in the recesses of the
machine lurk a butler and maid. Also there are all
the modern conveniences, from baths downward.
The owner avers that a caravan is a pleasanter
and healthier way of taking the air and viewing
the scenery than any motor that was ever
fashioned.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly left the Wentworth Falls
establishment, where she was vegetating with her
family in the absence abroad of her hubby, and
visited town last week. Her object was to per-
sonally superintend the slaying of a fatted calf or
two of welcome for consumption by the wanderer
when he returns. He will be back in ten days’
time, and already Glenyarrah is taking on a fresh
and burnished aspect.
One of the local residents who won’t be over-
joyed at the resumption of the status quo at Glen-
yarrah is Julius Knight. He had a loan of two
of the excellent Kelly servants, and now
that the family is to be once more in residence, he
is to lose them. Others like them are difficult to
find. The average cook now offering either
drinks heavily or is unable to cook, and the
normal house-parlormaid of the day is black,
answers to the name of Sambo or Ram Chunder
Ali, is blasphemous when annoyed, and has a
rooted aversion to soap, water, work, and the
truth.
Lord Northland, son and heir of the Ranfurly
Earl who was Governor of Maoriland between
1897 and 1904, has made his initial bow in the
Divorce Court. It is a bore in the way of loss of
time and money disbursed in lawyers’ fees, but if
you are a young man in the Cold Land’s Smart Set,
and mean to preserve a reputation for spirited con-
duct, you have to do it. The future Earl conies
of a family which has not hitherto occupied the
time of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty
Division much. Knox is the Ranfurly family
name, and the present holders of it are de-
scended from William Penn, who founded Penn-
sylvania, and left an odor of piety and burnt
witches behind him. The case promises to be of
more than usual interest. On the one hand,
Mr. John Alex. Stirling, of Perthshire, late lieu-
tenant in the 3rd Battalion Scots Guards, accuses
his wife, Clara Elizabeth Tiivlor, or Stirling, for-
merly an actress in the musical comedy company,
“The Earl and the Girl,” of frivolling with Lord
Northland, and on the other, Clara Elizabeth
Stirling alleges that John Alex, has car-
ried on with the famous Mrs. Ather-
ton. Mrs. Atherton was divorced from her
hubby last year, the Hon. John Yarde-Buller,
son and heir of Lord Churston, playing the
rdle of juvenile-lead on that occasion. When the
decree was made absolute the Hon. John refused
to toe the matrimonial mark with the lady, and,
instead, wedded Miss Denise Orme, of musical
comedy fame. Mrs. Atherton sued him for breach
and got judgment and costs. The jilted dame
was in S’Africa with her spouse (he com-
manded the 9th Lancers) during the Boer-British
disturbance. Those who met her describe her
charm as amazing. Ninety per cent, of the com-
missioned officers of the 10th Hussars (your 10th
Hussar is an even haughtier person than a
Guardsman) adored her blitheringly, and so did a
heap of other important males, from dukes down-
wards.
Mr. “ Tommy ” Burns is going to be responsible
for the arrival of three small immigrants to this
country within the next few weeks. His widowed
sister died in Canada the other day, leaving the
infants as almost her sole assets, and the Brussos,
who have no youngsters of their own, are going to
adopt the motherless ones and bring them up.
In the evolution of dress it is not the Frock
Fact that adapts itself to the environment; it
is the etceteras, the outside members, that
are forced to rigidly suit themselves to the
dress. Now happens the sudden change as if
done by a contortionist mirror. Everything is
contracting with horrible insistence. Alas for
the buxom blooms ! A note of interrogation, or a
Mrs. Eichorn, is the key-note or the pin of
fashion. The huge hats have diminished
to brimless busbies, elongated with an
upstanding brush. Everything horizontal is
lopped off, like a severely-pruned tree, and added
to the perpendicularity like a juggler’s cane. The
safest thing is to discard the present body and
build up a substitute of reinforced concrete. Soon
a law will be necessary to limit the height of any
human.
Even flowers and bouquets are rigidly nar-
rowed. The bride may not hide her blushes be-
hind half a ton of scrambled vegetable and tulle.
Fluffiness is doomed. Rigidity and narrowness—
narrow as the right road—are the insanely en-
forced law. Ascension lilies, or gladiolas, or
Moses bulrushes tied with an ultra severe bow
across their middle are just about the “cutest
thing out,” in present fashion’s language.
Irene Marks, that fair Amazonian slayer of
hearts, has opened a hat shop in Bond-street,
London. It is doubtful if the petted society
butterfly knows how to concoct one solitary lid of
feather and fur or flower, but it is hoped that
London sassiety will fall at her beautiful feet,
take whatever her assistants hand over, and say in a
faint voice : “Search me, and take all the wealth
I have about me, but do not—do not ask me to
give up the hat ! ” Society often does well when
it dabbles in trade—though London usually de-
mands a countess, at least, with her coronet over
the door. A name is the necessity ; the assistants
do the rest. Just as it is quite possible to run a
laundry without “washing yourself.”
Wellington, in Joseph Ward’s fair country, has
been tumbling over its cliffs in its furious wel-
come of Ada Crossley, and Ada has wreathed
herself in smiles and her most adorable sheath
frocks, and sung divinely in response. She is a
member of the Girls’ Realm Guild in Maoriland,
and the Guild raised a cordial reception at the
Hotel Windsor, which is one of the gorgeous
palaces of the unsteady city. That same
windy metropolis has more bloated and elaborate
hotels than all the rest of Maoriland put
together. About everybody of importance in the
Island turned up to the reception (the wind was
not invited and stayed away in a huff, to the extra
glory of the frocking). The absence of the
Mayoress, Mrs. Hyslop, left a gap on the plat-
form that it took two of her daughters to fill.
Joseph Ward came in his ultra-shining plug-hat,
and brought Mrs. Ward. The Most Excellent
Plunkets were away, but they receptioned and
dined the songstress later. Mrs. Seddon sat at
Miss Crossley’s right hand at the tea ceremony,
and the Walter Nathans, of racehorse wealth,
came from Auckland for the spree. Mr.
and Mrs. Ted Tourist Donne were im-
portant stars, and a niece, Miss Lorna Donne
(I nearly wrote Doone), presented rare
exotic vegetables to her godmamma Crossley.
Tittell Brune drooped languidly in the few inches
of space allowed for poseurs. The whole affair
was engineered by Miss Dimant, the secretary of
the Guild. When Miss Crossley was presented
with the official badge, a rosette of mauve and
white lilac, she found a tiki dangling from it.
Mr. Tourist Donne had the tiki, which
was dug up from some aged and decayed chief’s
grave.
Violet Vanbrugh is coming out with husband
Bourchier early next year, and her coming frocks
cast shadows ahead. The Vanbrugh, quite apart
from her mummer tricks, is a wondrous, snaky,
supple poseuse, with a sense for color and silky
clinging effects that will drive female theatre-
goers pale mauve with envy. Then they’ll roll up
night after night arid make surreptitious notes on
the backs of their powder puffs about giving the
3s. 6d.-a-day sewing girl “ hints” to copy. The
majority will plunge too luscious curves or angu-
lar bones into the “creations” done by the maid
at 3s. 6d., and fondly believe themselves on the
fringe of a cult that is evolved out of her color
consciousness by One Woman for Herself. Any-
how Violet will be a zest—an elusively dainty
morsel for playgoers.
Melba is so much within cooee that she left
Naples last week for Australia. The Orontes
brings her to Melbourne by March 3. Melba has
written at great length to Mr. Lemmone about
her tour. She wishes to make an exhaustive
backblocks journey, and visit the small, out-of-
the-way places the people whereof rarely go to
the capitals, and never hear a full-fledged
songstress except in the tree-chorus. She is
following the lead of Jenny Lind, who in her
Swedish tour visited far-back ice pinnacles and
sang to the penguins. Arrangements have already
been made to carry Melba on her road by waggon
or bicycle. Quirindi, by the way, has heard of the
disturbance, and has written to the management
imploring that it be included in the tour.
starts off with a hustled first guarantee of quite 60
guineas either in coin or in pigs and produce.
Miss Florence Gleeson’s sister, who was very
seriously ill, has fortunately taken a turn on the
right side of the crisis, and is recovering. Miss
Florence had to leave her part at the Royal to her
understudy, and hasten to her afflicted relative in
Melbourne. Greatly to her distress, a report
gained ground that her sister had died, which
report is hereby contradicted as useless, inaccurate,
and superfluous.
The redoubtable and musical Sykes is back in
Sydney. He has been sojourning in the Island of
Apples that sleeps at the foot of this continent.
Saturday saw a whole tableful of the folk who
foregather at Paling’s fortifying themselves at a
Cafe Francaise lunch before going along to say
“ Hurroo ” outside the church and watch the
wedding of Tenor Andrew Black with the charm-
ing widow of Pfahlert’s. The wedding was as quiet
as possible, only very4ntimatefriends being warned
of the hour. The widow wore a grey garb for the
sacrifice; then shed that dream of a gown for
smart blue travelling gear of the tailored descnp-
tion.
News comes of Ola of the divinely-devilish
locks. The Humphrey-Titheradge-Kolker com-
bination has doubled on its tracks, and gone to
Auckland to play “The Silver King” ; and Ola s
tresses are now waving in the breeze that blows
up the Hauraki Gulf.
Carlyle Smythe and his fascinating spouse send
sudden cards—P.P. C. “ Just off to spend a week-
end or so in the Vaterland, with a halt at the
Great Smoke,” write the sprightly Smythess.
The death of Mr. Rossbach —one of the two Local
Government engineers—was a most regrettable
occurrence. He dropped dead of heart disease on
Wednesday night. It is not an obituary plati-
tude to say that he was the best-liked man in the
Public Works Department. Only a few days
before Mr. Rossbach was elected as a member of
the Public Service Council. He not only got more
votes than any other candidate, but he got every
vote going. He was a man of about 48 years of
age, and was within touch of the highest offices
in his department.
The London correspondent of one of the Syd-
ney dailies said this last week :
You do not need a coat, unless the weather is Arctic,
when you have furs cut as I saw to-day on a handsome
ex-Australian woman.
The ex-Australian strikes me as a ritew develop-
ment. She is probably unique in her way. One
does not hear of ex-American women. On the
contrary, even Lady Essex and the Duchess
of Roxburgh, of the Cold Land—women who
have married British husbands and registered
vows, in a manner of speaking, to abide in
their spouses’ native country—don’t dream
of abandoning their nationality. They re-
main Americans, and are proud to do so.
London is dotted with American societies that,,
have been organised by U.S. A. natives resident
in the Great Fog; and the organisers would be
very angry indeed if you referred to them as ex-
Americans. Their money comes from Hamland,
and they consider, and rightly so, that the country
which finds them in diamonds and meals at Clar-
idge’s is good enough to own up to. French tourists
don’t become ex-Frenchmen and women because
they have brought a wad of money across the
Channel and are employed spending sovereigns
instead of louis, and shillings instead of francs.
Australia appears to be the only Country on earth
whose absentee citizens disown it as soon as they
get abroad. The ex-Australian woman, with
furs paid for with Australian money, and an un-
dying dread lest her friends shall know the source
of her income, is one of the unpleasantest of social
phenomena.
Some persons seem to have a genius for partly
humanising animals. The boys and girls of a
certain family of my acquaintance used to tell me
of the unusual behavior of their dogs, cats and
birds, but as I had frequently boasted that my
collie had learned to read I didn’t take much stock
of other persons’ brag. I thought some of it was
brag. But lately I was ambling about my friend’s
garden, and saw things that will make me hold
my tongue about my furred and coated four-
footed dependents. First, a huge black and white
cat came around from the kitchen, licking his
whiskers, and lay down for a doze on the lawn.
A wild bird—so little bird and such a lot of
tail—that had been pecking amongst the rose
bushes, immediately flew to the cat and stood
on its luxuriously outstretched tummy. The
cat lifted its head a fraction to see what was
pressing on its lunch, then, evidently recognising
the wagtail as an old friend, went to sleep again.
The bird will wait about for hours for the cat to
come out and be stood upen.
Same family has a big, well-nourished blaek-
and-tan dog. After going on the jag somewhere
in Woolloomooloo, Rover came home with a wiry-
haired, insanitary-looking, very starved mongrel
about ten inches high. This stray found good
food and drink in Rover’s quarters, and promptly
adopted the big dog and his owners. His devotion
to his rescuer is uncanny. He saves him the trouble
of washing his face and paws after a meal, for
he rushes in and does the service for him. Should
Rover start scratching, the small dog jumps for-
ward and takes up the struggle at the right spot.
Rover no longer barks at the “bottle-oh” men, for
the mongrel saves him that trouble. The maternal
house cat now evades the washing and combing
of her two young kittens. The mongrel does it
and keeps them amused so they shan’t worry Ma
Meow. Some humble, grateful, helpful and
homeless human soul has blundered into that
dog.
At Shepperton-on-Thames (England), there
exists what describes itself as “A School of
Colonial Instruction.” Here a British army cap-
tain named Morgan teaches a band of embryo
pioneers how to calm the billy when it boils, how
to identify a land agent in a Johnsonian railway
carriage, where to search for goburra spoor when
hungry, and a score of other matters invaluable to
one who has decided to make track-blazing his
life’s work. A while back the ca,ptain resolved
to marry a widow-woman of his acquaintance.
The London Daily Mail (11/12/’08) thus de-
scribes the typically “colonial” marriage cere-
mony that occurred :
Sixteen red-shirted cowboys upon sturdy ponies gal-
loped in front of the motor-car which held the bride,
waving- wide-brimmed hats, firing revolvers into the air,
and giving full lung-power to far-reaching “whoops.”
The noisy, picturesque cavalcade consisted of the cap-
tain’s jackeroo pupils. Bowie knives protruded from
their belts, their shirt-sleeves were rolled up to the
elbows, their cowboy trousers, boots and other equipment
were complete to the smallest detail.
How it must have brought the smell of the gum-
trees, and the long, low wail of the State Premier,
back to such Australians as were in the neighbor-
hood of Shepperton-on-Thames that day!
A paper “Save the Birds,” read by A. H.
Chisholm, of Maryborough, before a local society,
and published in two parts by the Maryborough
ani) Dunoluy Advertiser (Vic)., is a powerful
and pitiful appeal to women to forego the wearing
of what the writer calls “murderous millinery.”
With facts and figures he tries to awaken the con-
science of plumage-wearing women to a sense of
their crime. For cruelty is criminal, and the
woman who wears plumage that she knows has
been torn from the living bird ought to be treated
as a criminal. I would suggest three years’hard,
and when she comes out the compulsory wearing
for the term of her natural life of a poke bonnet,
trimmed with drab ribbon. Says Mr. Chis-
holm :
Some idea of the extent of the plume-plunderer’s
ravages may be gained from the fact that at the plume
auctions, held in London during the last six months of
1907, the catalogue included no fewer than 19,742 skins of
birds of paradise, while 1386 crowned pigeons’ heads were
offered at one sale alone, and 30,000 kingfishers, and 200
lyre birds’tails at another. There were also catalogued
1411 packages of the nesting plumes of the white egret,
representing the feathers of nearly 115,000 birds. This
beautiful bird—the white egret, or heron—is one of the
chief victims of murderous millinery, and the persecu-
tions of the plume-hunters have reduced its numbers so
greatly that at the present time it is within measurable
distance of becoming extinct. The breeding haunts of
the egrets are invaded every season by bands of ruthless
and ignorant men, whose methods of collecting the
coveted plumes, which are only donned by the birds in
nesting time, are so brutal that the mere recital of them
should effectively put a stop to the fashion of wearing
“aigrettes.”
In Australia the egrets nest largely amid the
great swamp lands of the upper Murray, and the
scene after a visitation by the jackals of fashion
unnerved the naturalist who looked upon it:
The dark waters of the swamp were strewn with blood-
stained bundles, of white feathers, floating silently, in
death. Above, in the big-stick nests, were perishing
families of young egrets, clinging feebly to their oomes
after many days without food or warmth. As the
observer passed along in his boat, those unfortunate
starvelings craned their skeleton heads over the nests
and uttered faint cries for the succor which would never
come to save them.
Nothing but legislation will save the fair birds
from the “fair sex.” the “gentler sex,” the
“ ministering angels.” And when it does come,
let us hope the police will be only half as keen to
spot evidences of bird murder for millinery as
they are to nose out Sunday drinking.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres—and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 1, 1909.
My Dear Yarrik, —
Governor Carmichael has been “ doing ” the fat
and ought-to-be-flourishing Western district. He
managed to swag it (by motor) in the comfort of a
disreputable-looking soft felt hat. Aide Victor
Hood went along just to indicate that there was a
Governor under the old brown hat. They have
been sharing the friendly damper with the Moles-
worth Greenes, the “Purrumbete” Manifolds, the
Everard Brownes, and lots more of the Western s
naicest people. The ten-days’ trip finished on
Saturday, when the Governor made a bee-line for
Macedon to spend a quiet and peaceful Sawborth
before returning to Melbourne to prize open the
A.N.A. Exhibition on Monday.
The Exhibition building is once more in a state
of upheaval, and the sound of the hammer pounds
the air. The A.N.A. Exhibition is to be opened
on Monday by the Carmichaels. Not a square
inch of floor is left to dump another exhibit on.
There is to be a complete dairy, also a model
poultry house with live chooky-hens and real eggs;
and a huge glass freezing chamber will show
how dead bunnies are packed for export. House-
wives have swamped the place with home-made
jams and preserves, and that two-legged animal
without feathers called man —the thing that the
fish described as an erect, dry object with prongs,
which goes horribly on land —has fashioned all
manner of iron things, from a torpedo down to a
thimble. The Women’s Choir, whose voice is a
power in the land, is busy oiling its top note for
use during the four weeks of the show, and if its
top-note is crowded out it will be an angry combi-
nation.
The old Earl of Leicester, who died last week,
was rather unduly honored by an obituary cable-
gram and quite a long notice in the Melbourne
morning papers. He was a matter of no Aus-
tralian interest, except in the fact that, some two
years ago, a Mr. Coke, of Melbourne, tried to
prove that he bad a prior claim to the title and
estates. The attempt was a dismal failure, like
the Druee claim to a dukedom, and everybody
had forgotten all about it until the earl’s decease
waS announced. He seems to have been the most
unremarkable octogenarian in the whole peerage,
so hopelessly dull and respectable that he reigned
as Keeper "of the Privy Seal to the Prince of
Wales for 30 years. But he married the daughter
of a brewer in his young days—and was doubtless
a charmingly wealthy person.
A real live peer, Earl Stanhope, has arrived in
Brisbane by the Makura, and at present ought to
be in Sydney. His obj ect of travel is ‘ ‘ to study the
problems of the Empire abroad.” As he is under
30 and unmarried, he will probably find the inter-
esting problem of the Eternal Feminine thrust
under his notice for consideration by the way.
The Summer School has finished its picnic at
Nepean Peninsula. Teachers and the much-
dreaded inspector have shaken the friendly paw
of good-fellowship and parted good friends. The
camp had a virulent outbreak of presentations,
and thrust the silver-backed brush and the auto-
graph album upon one another at the slightest
provocation.
Miss Mitchell, who is the drawing teacher at the
Technical Art School at Warrnambool, conducted
a class of admiring art students—mostly men —
each day for the four weeks. They worshipped
under the shade of the palm to the music of
the ant and the cricket, and rose up on the last
day and enthusiastically made a presentation to
the favorite.
There was an exodus of clergy last w'eek.
Archdeacon Hindley departed to the Bleak Land
of England with his wife and daughter and a
heavy purse of golden sovereigns, which the Very
Best People of the Cathedral laity had gathered for
him. Three hundred coins caused the heaviness.
Up in Collins-street the Baptists wept their fare-
well over little Pearce Carey, sometimes known as
Fierce Canary—and loaded him up with pursy
luggage. The golden-tongued little man was a
great Browning scholar, and his lectures on that
rather obscure and tangled poet will be missed.
Still Browning will keep. What Melbourne really
wants is a Josh Billings Society.
Re the recent arrival from China of two sons—
Louis and Willett—of our white-haired and
cheruby Dr. Bevan. The pastoral parent has a
pleasant summer residence at Upper Beacons-
field, some 25 miles from Melbourne, and there the
visitors will abide for a few weeks. Eaclj
of them brought a wife and offspring with him,
the spouse in the young parson’s case being Miss
Vale (as was), and the progeny a miraculous baby.
Somebody was remarking that one or other of the
Bevans from China must be the tall brother who
played “ heavy lead ” in the Trinity College per-
formance of “ Alcestis” years ago, at Melbourne
Town Hall. But somebody erred in that assump-
tion. The hero of the Greek tragedy (his pro-
nunciation of the dead language was declared to
be “ beautiful ” by all who couldn’t understand it)
was D. J. D. Bevan. His wife, on that occasion,
was Miss Florence Towl. She died early in the
drama. After which Hercules (Mr. Bullivant)
came and fought with Death, behind the scenes,
and restored the late lamented to her husband’s
care.
The case of a Prahran milkman convicted of
filling the domestic jugs with skim milk, which
(as he said in Court) had been really intended for
a “ sick horse ” and not for human consumption,
reminds me of how High Court Justice Isaacs
iately dismissed a member of the milk-oh brother-
hood with a severe caution. Mrs. Isaacs, the
Judge’s mother, lay sick at the house of son John,
the ex-M.L. A. Fresh, pure milk was essential to
her recavery, and because the man who had been
supplying the household was rather late in his
morning round, another and an earlier milkman
was engaged. The newcomer gave complete satis-
faction for a day or two, but on the third
day the milk toaS found to he curdling
just as it was poured into a glass
for Mrs. Isaacs. Had she taken Only a
little of it the result would probably have
been fatal. When the new milkman, came round
in the afternoon the jug containing the curdled
stuff was shown to him. He looked at it, sniffed
at it, and their, he put the pertinent question,
“Has there been another milkman supplying the
house ? ” Being asked the inner meaning of his
query, he explained that the rival merchant had
been guilty of a common trick of the trade. From
a small bottle which some of the brethren carry
in a vest pocket he had poured one drop
of vinegar into the vessel that stood on
the doorstep, with a view to blasting
the character of the other fellow’s milk.
The evidence was submitted to Justice Isaacs,
who called every morning at his brother’s house
to see his mother, and in due course the offending
milkman was brought before him. The man
thought he had been summoned to the house to
receive a renewal of the old order for milk, but
when the learned Judge called him from off the
mat into the dining-room, and glared at him with
a terrible judicial glare that seemed to penetrate
to his very soul, the culprit lost all presence of
mind. “You put vinegar into our milk jug, you
miscreant! ” thundered the august personage.
The trembling accused could think of nothing but
“Ye-e-s,”in reply. “You confess your guilt ? ”
roared the High Court, and the man answered
“Ye-e-es.” Then the Majesty of the Law ex-
plained that the prisoner at the dining-table
might have been convicted of manslaughter had
old Mrs. Isaacs taken the milk and vinegar, but
in consideration of his apparent penitence and
his undoubted funk he would be allowed to go free
for the present.
Hugo Wertheim, who suspends externally at
Queenscliff these times, signalised the arrival of the
German training ship Herzogin Sophie Charlotte
with much hospitality. He treated a number of
the cadets to a mild junketing at the Ozone Hotel.
The young men in tall collars and neat, brass-
buttoned uniforms twirled their rather commo-
dious feet in the dreamy waltz, and made them-
selves pleasant. Once or twice they upraised
their combined voices in song of a rather dreary
character. Mrs. Hugo Wertheim, in a neat frock
that was spotted with black and white like a
checkered career, and sporting some massive
battlements of pink roses in her corsage, hostessed
the multitude of cadets and (mostly) short-frocked
girls. As for Hugo, genial soul, he made himself
useful generally with a diabolical black German
cigar partially submerged in his countenance.
If sympathy and consolation were synonymous,
Jack Dane and his girl-wife would have a lighter
sorrow to bear. Everyone will regret to hear of
the birth and death of a child to them —a baby
that just saw the big world for an hour or so, and
then went home. The young matron is a magnifi-
cent specimen of Australian womanhood, meant
to be the mother of strong men, and this bereave-
ment will be the more trying as she is so far away
from people and friends, and this was her first
experience of motherhood.
Miss Morris, one of the sisters who preside
over Merton Hall (the Anglican Church Girls’
Grammar School), has undertaken to marry Mr.
Crotty, a tall, dark, athletic parson. Which re-
minds me that Mr. Morrison, head of the wealthy
Geelong College (Scotch), and a supposedly incor-
rigible bachelor, is understood to be on the point
of joining the Benedicts. The charming lady
who is credited with the dominie’s conversion is a
Miss Morris, but no relation to the Morrises of
Merton Hall aforesaid.
Miss Maggie Robertson, who won the Derby
with her horse Alawa, has now won the Matri-
monial Stakes. She has promised to hand over
bit and bridle to Mr. George Buchanan, a Mel-
bourne man of Victorian landed wealth.
Artist Dora Sommers follows artist brother
Jack’s example, and is taking a life partner.
About Easter she is to make the “ I will ” remark
to a young Hercules of the Commonwealth Home
Department, who distinguished him-
self some two years ago by diving into a hidden
river snag. He was carried from the holiday
camp on that occasion almost scalpless, but, thanks
to surgery and a good constitution, Dora’s adorer
lives to jest at his scar. He has lost his scalp
only in the figurative sense that it now dangles
from Dora’s girdle.
At last the artistic temperament is to have a
holiday resort all to itself. Painter Hal Waugh
has conceived the idea of converting his charming
Eltham home into a “paying guest” establish-
ment for artists and art students only, so no
longer need the recruiting genius have his peace
disturbed by the offending oleograph and the irre-
pressible musician. It is a home designed by
an artist for an artist, wherein the budding Corot
may dream his dreams exquisitely. Leslie
Wilkie, Norman Carter, and the cherubic Hal
himself also intend holding classes there for the
benefit of the more strenuous trippers. From
which it appears that to be intensely soulful is
not necessarily to lack business instinct. But as
regards those paying guests—are artists and art
students the sort of guests who pay, in the common
or Gothic sense of the term ?
Mrs. 11. W. Bryant, who with her brilliant bar-
rister husband set off for a pleasure trip around
Maoriland, struck bad luck at the first port. She
had to leave the boat at Dunedin to spend part of
her holiday in a private hospital. Her illness is
painful, though not serious, and it is hoped the
pair will be able to take the second course of the
journey in a fortnight or so.
News of Katherine Goodson tells of a successful
time at Honolulu, on her way to Vancouver.
There had to be a wild rush back to the boat by
motor car ; the party, in its best evening clothes,
trailed much unnecessary vegetable, and scrambled
breathlessly on board as the gangway was being
hauled up. Following the custom of the Island,
the pianist’s admirers had hung wreaths of laurel
and carnations round her neck, “ as a small token
of their esteem,” as they say in polite society.
Melbourne billiard players are using up all the
energy left them by the heat, enthusing over
young Gray, the Queensland boy player, who is
“cannoning off the red” for all he is worth. The
weather and he each made a record “break” on
Thursday afternoon. It was “ ladies’ ” day, and
a proud mother sat in pride whilst young hope-
ful did his record-smashage. Boy Gray takes his
“cue ” from his father, who is a bully player.
A war of worry and words has swirled in the
daily papers regarding tips for the driver of the
taxi. An insistent shout from managerial quarters
has split through the flurry, and the burden there-
of is, “There ain’t goin’ to be no tips.” Never-
theless, the imported art of tipping spreads like
the imported bunny, which entered as a small
luxury, and behold! has inherited the earth.
And the tips are high compared with those of
Londen and Paris, for what Australian menial
ivould accept tuppence ! Jtist consider the reflec-
tion Of tuppence on the face of an Australian free-
born porter or waiter !
The Willie Finlays, who were booked for
another jaunt London-wards by the outgoing
Morea, have postponed their trip for a space.
After a brief experiment in housekeeping, the
gilded two intend putting up at the Australia
awhile, what time the lady will be able to give
t’othersiders a glimpse at a few of her forty frocks.
A returned tripper whose name one seems to
remember in connection with, legal proceedings
dragged herself into Her Majesty’s Theatre on
Saturday night in the most approved and un-
gainly latest London manner. To be “correct,
it seems, you must hold your body well forward,
your shoulders must come up under your ears till
your low-dressed hair almost touches your high-
drawn waist, and your face must wear a loose ex-
pression of utter inanity and boredom. Ihe
returned gadder was a glad dream of shimmer
and sheen in a frock that looked like one large,
smudged rose, whilst her evening coat was of a
more brilliant yellow than the ripest orange that
grows.
The somewhat beauteous model of many adver-
tisements is once again out on the matrimonial
warpath. After a brief, bright period of widow-
hood adorned with all the trappings of correct
grief, the lady is to be taken for better or worse
by a wealthy rubber merchant with a large
plantation.
Miss Helena Rubinstein, who directs the re-
juvenation of those who can afford to pay for it,
flits.through Australia for a brief month before
setting out to open a beautifying-bureau in India.
She is in Melbourne for one week only, like a
“star” stage-lady. Besides some wonderful
frocks, Miss Rubinstein has brought along with
her a new husband, so that her “ really-truly ”
name is now Mrs. Titus. Her husband, I regret
to say, has not yet replied to that letter which
Paul sent to him in the New Testament. Like
myself, he is a dilatory correspondent. Mrs.
Titus is a little brunette, and a charming denial of
the statement that women are lacking in the busi-
ness instinct. Between her dainty ruffled collar
and her smart satin hat lies a world of acumen
and originality. Melbourne, which was once the
headquarters of her business, is now a mere play-
thing and a side show. In London, the titled
dowager is an eager votary at her elaborately-
equipped altars, whilst a 500-guinea fee for send-
ing a wrinkle-remover across the Atlantic to wave
the magic hand over the features of a. New York
millionairess is a not impossible incident. Mrs.
Titus chats prettily of gadding Australians, and
mentioned that she saw our only Nell the day
before she left London—just the same Sweet Nell,
j very busy engaging her company for Australia,
managing everything herself (George Musgrove is
:convalescing in Sydney), very anxious to succeed
in her forthcoming tour, and very lonely without
her little girl, who is at boarding-school in Swit-
zerland.
A recent par. in “Melbourne Chatter” may
have been misunderstood to mean that the
Rembrandt Studio, in the Block Arcade, passed
out of existence when the Misses Hicks retired
therefrom. They transferred the business to Mr.
J. W. Wherrett, who is also an artist as well as a
photographer, and under his management the
Studio is not less open to consideration than of
yore.
On a recent P. & O. liner a returning Mel-
bourne matron entertained her friends with a
conceit which was so unbounded as to be really
interesting. The second officer—a bit of a wag-
asked had she seen many beautiful women in
London. “Do you know,” remarked the cameo
beauty, “since I left Australia I have only seen
one woman whom I should be afraid outvie
me, and she was in a frame at the Louvre.”
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide
The second day that the Dudleys were here Australia’s
G -G. came down from Marble Hill to meet our G.G. Our
GO you don’t hear so much of nowadays, but the cricket
writers used to call him that for short, when they had got
tired of saying at length that George Giffen hit somebody
for six, or put himself on at the other end. After a spell
at the Oval, in the cause of Muscle, the Governor-
cricketer dutifully turned his other cheek to the cause of
Art and with her Ex. explored the Public Gallery.
Already there’s talk of the Parliamentary team meeting
his Ex.’s cricket eleven. Later in the week his Ex.
motored down to Victor Harbor, stopping on the way at
the Oudmores’ place to shoot a quail or two.
For the races on the 25th the elements had their best
bib and tucker on. Such fine behavior you never saw,
and all sassiety that wasn’t at its “ country house was
on the spot to see the Dudleys—“ quite close, my dear.
The vice-regal box had his Excellency’s colors, straw anfl
violet twined fetchingly about it, and there were special
vice-regal racebooks of much splendor. But Herself
didn’t come, and the party was entirely he and umn-
terestino-. Only Lord Dicky Nevill was hailed by an old
friend here and there. There’s a new members’ stand
beino- built at Victoria Park, and at present it looks
shamelessly nude in that abode of beauteous rose-and-
greenery. ' None of the frocking was exciting enough to
deserve any extra publicity. ,
The Glenelg amateur mermen had a carnival the otner
Saturday, and did their best to get chilled to the
bone. (I might mention incidentally that in Adelaide it
has mostly been a cold winter this summer.) Four tiers
of seats had been arranged along the north side of the
baths for the breakable sex, and they were all packed
tight with thick furs and winter-coats. Even then there
was some shivering and shaking and clattering of teeth.
For mermaids there was but one event, and only three
damsels ventured into the wet. The prize was won by a
small Farrelly child, who swam like a mer-damsel, and
had long red-gold hair to help sustain the character. As
a gentle relief from the serious racing business there was
a clownish person who emerged out of the atmosphere,
tore precariously round the roof, and fell into the sea.
Also there was a Burns-Johnson fight of hilarious
character, with sundry pugnacious-looking policemen to
be treated unkindly for stopping the fight. It was a
frilly assemblage that shivered on the tiers, including a
batch of Speaker Coles’girls, some of the Mayoral Varleys,*
a Talbot Smith or so, a Pile or two, and some Scammells
and others. . , „ , , , ■
The University of Geneva, which can’t help having its
three-hundred-and-somethingth anniversary in July,
has invited our ’Varsity to send someone along to show
them what we can produce. The Council has chosen Mr.
J. G. R. Murray, who is a K.C. nowadays, but was one of
the first graduates turned out from this seat of learning.
In fact, it was only an infant’s chair when J. G. R. Murray
won his South Australian scholarship.
The officers and boys of the German training ship were
at Glenelg on the holiday, and the H. W. Varleys enter-
tained them, and showed them the gum-tree under which
we were declared a province, and the train that runs up
and down the main street, and all the other local curiosi-
ties. The visitors brought their band along with them,
and it played all over the place and provided a very nice
noise though German. In the eve the host and hostess
took the boys in bulk to the Pierrots.
In a few months artist Will Ashton is going off again on
another painting jaunt. He intends to descend upon
Italy, and (earthquakes permitting) to paint there until
further notice. In March he is to have an exhibition in
this hamlet, which remark is intended as a warning to
the public that if it doesn’t save up a sovereign or two by
that time, it’ll be sorry ever after.
Lobethal, the little German township which makes
good tweed and blankets, and claims our Clara Klein-
schmidt for its special own, got itself into a state of
excitement on the 26th, when the talented maid had a
farewell concert there. The local hall nearly burst its
walls, it was so fiercely packed. After the programme,
there were speeches and rhetoric galore, and, finally, her
townsfellows gave the maiden a dressing-case and a rug,
manufactured in the local mills, which last, by the way,
are just opposite Miss Kleinschmidt’s home —another
illustration of the “debasing influence" of manufactures
upon Art.
Motorists have been getting their names into the papers
no end of times lately. The other day Bertie -Barr Smith
and H. M. Aunger (he who moted across Australia with
Harry Dutton erstwhile) shot off to try to leap from here
to Melbourne in record time. They took a 60 steed-
power Napier to do it with. Same day one of the Reed-
beds Whites stowed his 35-h.p. Talbot into the Melbourne
train with the purpose of tearing back to Adelaide before
the other party had got into Collins-street.
Yours affectionately,
TARIFFINA.


An Australian Favorites Splendid Triumph
HOW SHE CONQUERED THE WORLD’S METROPOLIS.
She Tells the Interesting Story in an Interview.
By DOROTHY C.........
I have heard from an old friend in London of
the marvellous success which has fallen to the
share of a woman whose name is known all over
Australasia. My friend has written me: “How
everything about the lady interests, attracts,
charms and rouses the most piquant curiosity.
How she has stirred, fascinated and compelled the
grandest of London’s grand dames into interest.
How one looked, marvelled and heard, and hear-
ing, marvelled Still more.”
Right into the heart and core of smart London,
right into the midst of Worrtan’s Mecca, this
enterprising woman has opened an establishment
of the most refined, cultured, and at the same
time of the most remarkable order ever known in
any capital of modern Europe.
A student of history, of literature and philo-
sophy, this woman has learnt in the annals of the
world, and in the indelible character of human
nature, the impression left by the power and scope
of woman’s beauty. Later study led to a know-
ledge of chemistry, and to pass on from that into
the realms of anatomy, and laboratory and hospi-
tal work, under the greatest authorities in Vienna,
Berlin, Paris, Russia, and elsewhere, was only a
logical step. This knowledge, experience, and
extensive travels, and astonishing capacity for un-
remitting work, combined with wonderful business
acumen, have resulted in the founding and de-
veloping of an enterprise which now covers the
whole world. Therefore, having heard of Mile.
Rubinstein’s arrival in Australia, I have made it
my business to call on her at the Grand Hotel,
Melbourne, to hear from her own lips the story of
her rare success, and how she has achieved it.
Giving it to my readers, I can do no better than
quote her own words, which, in their straightfor-
ward simplicity; are more eloquent than any
labored literary polish can possibly make them.
“ There is nothing more distasteful to me,
began Mile. Rubinstein, “ than speaking of my-
self. I would much rather tell you how glad lam
to re-visit Australia, the place of my first real
successes. I would much rather ”
I was obliged to interrupt what I considered to
be evasiveness, and to impress on Mile. Rubin-
stein that my call was professional, not social, nor
prompted by friendship only.
“Well, since you insist,” Mile, resumed, “ I
will tell you that I have always scrupulously
followed the adage—‘Be sure you are right, and
then go ahead.’ When, some years ago, I se-
cured the sole control of the Valaze Complexion
Treatments, which at the present time are
known to women of refinement the world over,
I knew I could offer specialties which, in their
own particular sphere, had no equal, certainly
no superior. I knew that they were not the
product of obscure origin, but the fruit of the
best thought, the best experience of scientists,
whose names are sacred to enlightened medical
practitioners. Having in my own heart of hearts
satisfied myself of this much, I made my start.
My first beginning, away from home, by which I
mean beautiful Vienna on the Danube, was in
Melbourne. Why in Australia? you may ask.
Because I wanted to put the marvellous proper-
ties of my specialties to the most difficult tests
imaginable—a tropical climate. The complexion
corrective or preserver or beautifier that will
prove its worth in a climate which is as ruinous to
the complexions as is the climate of some parts of
Australasia must be one of great worth indeed.
From Melbourne the little jars of Valaze have
gradually begun to go out to every nook and cor-
ner of this isolated continent, then to New
Zealand, then to India, to Africa, till orders were
coming from Italy and Turkey and Paris and
London and America. In this wise, Valaze
was stretching out its tentacles, soon embracing
every section of the civilised and uncivilised
world. In this wise has been paved the way
for me, which led to the hub of the world —
London. It finally became imperative to estab-
lish a depfit in that city. But the idea of a mere
dep6t was soon abandoned when I discovered that
London, with its swarms of Beauty Specialists in
every street, practising this method and that,
selling compounds of every description and
nostrums of every kind, none of them possessing
any particular virtue, some being productive
of positive injury—and being only but a few
hours removed from Paris, with myriads of Beauty
Doctors of its own, and with toilet and beauty
preparations as numerous as the sands of the sea,
I soon discovered that London presented the very
opportunity that I had been waiting for. I have
tested the merits of my preparations severely, by
letting them carry out their work of complexion
preserving and beautifying in climates that are
the most difficult on God’s earth. They came out
with flying colors. I was now determined to throw
my fortunes into the great yawning vortex of
London and Paris combined. I was determined
to place my Valaze preparation in this seething
arena, where it would be opposed by armies of
uncounted complexion specialties, the greater
number of which have been established for years
and years. Would victory be mine ? A battle be-
gan, with diminutive and valiant Yalaze on
the one side, and the safely-entrenched
hosts of charlatans on the other.
One month told the tale. I now
count the bearers of some of the noblest names of
Great Britain amongst my clients. I have letters
of appreciation and thanks from the most famous
of English actresses. Amongst them is the
famous London creator of the Merry Widow, Miss
Lily Elsie, and Miss Elizabeth Firth, who, in the
part of Nathalie, has gathered a goodly quantity
of laurel. And then there is that beautiful and
statuesque Australian girl, Alice Crawford, who
has won London by storm, and the inimitable
comedienne, Miss Ethel Irving. The great Ella-
line Terriss is here, and Cissy Loftus, who now
commands a salary of £5OO a week; and the
charming warbler, Ruth Vincent, and the never-
to-be-forgotten Edna May. My establishment at
24 Gra'fton-street, London, West, consisting of
twenty/tofa-Jqftyk lar 8 e rooms > known as the
Maiso|i,,d£ Beaute Valaze. .. . Oh, but I shall not
say another word, except this: Look, here is a
letter from Mrs. Maesmore Morris, only recently
one of the greatest of Australian stage favorites,
now living in England, whose classic beauty was
proverbial throughout the length and breadth of
Australia. This is what she says
“ ‘ I am so delighted to see that you have started
a depdt in London. For three years now I have
been sending to Australia for Valaze, and it’s joy-
ful to tbink I can obtain it here. I hope you will
have all the success your truly wonderful Creme
deserves. I wouldn’t be without it for the world,
and my skin is not a bad advertisement, as you
know.’
“I am showing this letter as an evidence of
what my Australian expatriated friends think of
my Valaze when away from Australia, with all of
Europe’s best to choose from. And there are
scores of similar letters each day.”
And not another word would Mile. Rubinstein
say. But most interesting indeed were the auto-
graph letters, for which presently Mile, was fish-
ing, letters from women in Christiania, Rio de
Janeiro, Constantinople, Paris, and every nook and
corner of Great Britain, from all over the world,
in fact; letters with coronets, betraying the Royal
origin of the writer, asking for appointments,
ordering preparations, and expressing thanks for
results, which have, till then, been impossible.
One is indeed compelled to exclaim with Celia,
“Oh, wonderful, most wonderful, and most
wonderful ! And yet again, wonderful!”
I asked Mile. Rubinstein to favor me with her
latest photograph. She replied she had none,
but kindly offered me the use of an interesting
sketchy portrait of her (reproduced on this page),
etched at the order of a grateful client by the
Swedish artist, Hagborg, who now enjoys such
vogue in London.
Mile. Rubinstein has now come over to Aus-
tralia on what she calls a flying trip to visit her
friends and business establishments. She must be
back in London for the next London season. She
will visit her New Zealand branches, and pro-
ceed from there to India, where she is
to complete arrangements for two branches.
While with us, every client of hers will
be privileged, as will others who have not
yet been her clients, to ask either personally
or by letter for any advice that may be desired to
be had on the subject of complexion treatments.
In fact, Mile. Rubinstein invites allto take the
fullest advantage of her presence here, and assures
me that she will always be happy to explain any-
thing within reason concerning the new special-
ties which she has brought over with her, either
in the way of treatment at her various Institutes,
or of home treatments. A Russian Balsam Im-
pregnation treatment, which lasts a full hour,
during which time the whole face is practically
saturated with health and beauty-bringing
balsams, has been one of Mile. Rubinstein’s suc-
cesses in London. Special machinery for this
treatment has been imported by her for her Aus-
tralian branches. The effect of the treatment is
the nearest thing to rejuvenation of the skin that
my imagination is capable of picturing.
Amongst other new treatments is one for the
relief of tired, strained eyes, that have become
lined, colorless and unattractive.
As to preparations, the most valuable novelty
is Valaze Speciale. An absolutely non-greasy
variant of the wonderful skin food, for day use.
When applied it leaves the skin without the
slightest trace of oiliness or unctuousness, but pre-
sents a lovely white surface, and when used in
conjunction with the Valaze Snow Lotion or one
of the two face powders that Mile, has the mono-
poly of, a most charming result is attained,
namely, that perfect ivory finish that has been the
rage of the Continent and so sought after. It is
a pure, white preparation, very smooth, easily
worked, with a texture light and airy. Now that
I have seen Valaze Speciale, I cannot understand
how it has ever been possible to get on without it
in this country. “ Valaze,” to build beauty while
you sleep. Valaze Speciale, to bestow it the live-
long day. That must now be the programme of
fashion.
Can you still wonder at Mile. Rubinstein’s
success ? The Valaze Snow Lotion, the most
refined of all Liquid Powders, which
caressingly clings to the skin’s surface,
cools it, and gives that precise tint that
one wishes ; delicate, refreshing, sweet-*
scented, a veritable luxury. Novena
Sun-proof Creme, a scientific protective
against the sun’s malice; the Novena
Cerate, for cleansing the skin when
soap and water should not be used
for it; and then the wonderful Marienbad Flesh
Reducing Tablets, that come from where King
Edward takes the cure year in and year out. But
unless I mean to turn this interview into a cata-
logue or into a sort of Beauty’s Shop Window, I
must pull myself up and only say, “ May she con-
tinue meeting with success which so deservedly is
hers —may this clever little lady.”
To show how different scientific beauty-culture
is from unscientific and slipshod methods, Mile.
Rubinstein’s book, “Beauty in the Making,” has
been translated ..and adapted for circulation in
English-speaking countries. As a contribution to
the literature of Beauty of Woman it has been
acknowledged to be a book of interest. It is a
handbook which sums up the very latest re-
searches of a science that should be dear to the
heart of every woman. “Beauty in the Making”
has been written with a view of making the care
of the complexion and the achievement of its
beauty a pleasant, easy task, an intelligent,
practical occupation, in the privacy of your own
home.
Anyone who will write to Mile. Rubinstein for
“Beauty in the Making,” enclosing 3d. for
postage, will receive it free of charge, but it is
essential, in justice to The Bulletin, to mention
this issue as the source of the inducement.
All orders, applications for appointments, or
for Mile. Rubinstein’s new book, “Beauty in the
Making, ” will be promptly attended to if addressed
to Mile. Helena Rubinstein and Co., 158 Pitt
Street, Sydney j or Dept. 14, Yalaze Institute,

POLITICAL
POINTS
Consider how a Labor Premier does things.
Some time last year, or the year before, Adolphus
Bent wasgrieved to hear about the prevalentadulte-
ration of chaff, hay, bran, etc. After a while he
actually introduced a Bill which he shoved gently
half way through the House; which point it
reached in a damaged condition. Then, however,
something happened, and he left off shoving!
Now Premier Murray promises to re-introduce the
measure next session. Yet Price, of South Oss,
though handicapped by a late start, modelled his
Bill on Bent’s measure, put it through both
Houses in a business-like way ; and the fear of the
Law has already entered the damaged soul of the
adulterator in that State.
If only the big landlord disease were
rooted out, Victoria would have sufficient reason
to “feel good ” just now, for its wheat crop is a
record. In the first two weeks of 1908 the rail-
ways carried only 457,000 bags of wheat; the first
fortnight of 1909 saw Tait given the job of humping
(strictly by proxy) 1,484,000 bags. But still cocky
can find something to growl about and be happy :
he can’t get trucks fast enough to carry off his
fatness —or the landlord’s fatness, as the case may
be- to market. And when there are not enough
trucks to carry about 75 per cent, more than he
usually wants carried, he heaves a brick at
“Socialism,” and the Deform apostle whispers
in his ear that Private Enterprise and Anti-Sosli
between them can always do the thing better.
Somehow, though, Private Enterprise and Anti!
Sosh never offer to carry cocky’s starving stock
for nothing when the drought year lopes along)
ROUSE YE, MY COMRADES, ROUSE YE!
Last year a camp was prevented, through the railways
not having sufficient rolling stock available. Mr. Ewing-
the late Minister, then, it is claimed, promised a double
camp this year, and the force is now looking to have this
arze ngement kept . The departmen tal answer is that
practicall all the money went in the Fleet demonstra-
tions. The volunteers also cannot have a camp, and the
Garrison Artillery can have only four days.
The Battle of North Sydney ” was the
heading which the Evening News affixed in large
black letters to its account of certain operations
on the anniversary of the Day We Were Lagged
and ot suggested that something really serious
was being done in the way of military training.
,ut a reading of the lengthy yarn revealed that
there were 70 kiddies on one side and 125 small
boys on the other, and a total of 195 offsprings
isn t quite an army—in fact, it isn’t quite a regi-
ment even. ”
The Wade Government Police Offences
legislation, under which Sunday traders, for-
tune-tellers, spiritists and idle persons are
being chased from pillar to post, is in some
respects a reproduction of the N.S.W. police
regulations issued by Governor Macquarie in 1811.
Macquarie’s regulations proved a failure in the
end, but for a year or so they had a terror-
ising effect. The potentate fixed 9 p.m.
as the hour to shut up pubs, wine shops,
and similar places in Sydney, and if
noise were heard on the premises later,
the constable had authority to break
in and carry all the inmates to the
lockup. A constable who suspected
a house to be of bad character was
authorised to break in and carry off the
inmates. Idle and disorderly persons
were to be whipped and confined. “All
poor persons not using proper means to
get employment ... or wilfully absenting
themselves from their work ’’ were to be
treated as idle and disorderly, and whipped.
The fact that this treatment was specially
reserved for poor persons is worth noting.
Two convictions qualified the “ poor person ”
to be classified as an “incorrigible rogue,”
and then he was liable to a long
term in gaol and frequent whip-
pings. Macquarie never did
things by halves. The police
grew fairly affluent under these
regulations ; when they weren’t paid
they had an insane desire to haul
almost anybody away to the whip-
ping emporium, so as a rule they
were paid.
The recently-passed Australian
Stowaways Act has seemingly set
steamship companies decisively on
the warpath against the surreptitious
pig-tailed passenger. Recently the
German steamer Prinz Waldemar
left Hongkong after a search which
didn’t unbunker a solitary illicit
Chow. At odd times during fine
weather at sea the officers had another
search, and discovered nothing in
particular. But it was at Simpson-
hafen, New Britain, that the ship-
ping people waded in properly—the
wading in, it is understood, is to
be a usual disturbance on the
co.’s steamers at Simpsonhafen
in future. Passengers and
Chinese crew were sent ashore,
and the vessel was handed
over to a posse of 20 native
police. After eight hours’
ferreting in the steamer’s in-
nards the triumphat nigs,
dragged into daylight seven verv
sick and smudgy Celestial tourists
whom they had found sojourning un-
obtrusively in the coal bunkers. As an
outpost for White Australia t.ho No™
Britain nigger distinctly scored that trip.
The feminine candidates for positions as
Labor nominees for next N.S.W. Senate election
failed to win a place. The successful three were
all men McDougrall, who was in last unsuccessful
bunch; Gardiner, Labor M.L.A. for Orange in
last State Parliament; and Arthur Rae, who was
in the Assembly years ago, and has put up a re-
cord as an unsuccessful candidate since then.
But a fine sturdy battler is Rae, whom it would
take more than a few unsuccesses to crush.
The Ward Government (M.L.) could do
with millions, but it looks m the till, and what it
doesn’t see there makes it go a bit slower. Both
Wellington and Auckland want new post offices.
Tenders were invited; then, having got them’
the Ministry further inspected the till, and de-
cided that it couldn’t accept any. Here and
there credit is being given to Ward and Co for
pigeon-holing tenders “till the finances are cleaned
up.” On the same principle, this writer is
entitled to public applause for not buying three
motor cars, a steam yacht, and £1,000,000 worth
of pictures, not to mention a few trifles which
wouldn’t look so well in print.
“ D.M.W.,” from Maoriland :
The constitution of Premier Ward’s new Ministry
shows that the potentate from Awarua has a catholic
mind in matters political. Scarcely apolitical opinion
that is current anywhere to-day lacks enthusiastic repre-
: sentation in his Cabinet. Fowlds, Single-taxer and Free-
trader works in amity with Miliar, enthusiastic
Protectionist. Tom Mackenzie, freeholder, is to run in
harness with Hogg, an ardent leaseholder. N°-ata a
staunch advocate of work, will assist Jimmy Carroll who
has long held the portfolio of Repose. Bu'ddo has ’been
brought in to keep George Laurenson out; it was found
necessary to give Canterbury a member, and little
Laurenson takes such a large size in brains that the
Cabinet couldn’t safely hold him. Roddy Mackenzie is
generally regarded as having secured hi's place by the
power of his breath and the urgency of his whisker but
those who know Roddy are of a different opinion.’ He
has on one or two occasions displayed so truculent an
attitude m Parliament that his inclusion in the Ministry
may be an act of discretion on the part of a great leader
One thing is clear. With such a collection of colleagues
Ward does not mean to legislate. He will just sit still
and borrow until the cup of wrath is full and the hoof of
doom kicks him into the outer darkness.
“Borrow all you can!” says John
Forrest. It is never too late to spend. Borrowed
money gravitates largely to the pockets of the
monopolists, and, since posterity has to pay why
hesitate to borrow? Posterity never did any-
thing for us, consequently it is our privilege to do
for posterity—also to do posterity. Every coun-
try reaps what it owes ; but John Forrest will not
be around at the harvest time, so his advice is
“ borrow all you can.”
Cadge what you can. With little ruth
Allow the people of to-morrow
To learn in sorrow dire the truth—
’Tis easier to earn than borrow !
The murder of Constable Hyde by three
mysterious miscreants lias r.t length turned Ade-
laide’s attention to the subject of its police pro-
tection, and Adelaide wears a worried look in
consequence. Sydney provides a Robert for about
every 569 inhabitants, and Melbourne a similar
official generally a very bad one—for about every
004 inhabitants. Adelaide, on the other hand
has to be content—though it isn’t—with one trap
to about every 1011 inhabitants. In the Adelaide
suburbs the area that a bobby has to supervise
often looks like a German principality. Adelaide
and its suburbs cover a bigger area than Sydney
and its suburbs do, and while an Adelaide bobby
has about twice as many people to protect as a
Sydney one he has also, in many cases, to walk
over nine times the ground to do his protecting.'
“ Australian Federation is more necessary
to-day than at the time it was consummated. If
it had not been done at leisure at the commence-
ment of the century, it would have to be done in
haste to-day, because it is more than ever neces-
sary for the existence of Australia in the Pacific.”
—John A. Cockbukn, chairman . at
the Australasian Chamber of, Com-
merce in London on December 28.
THE NEW FRIENDLY
ATTITUDE.
At a recent fish dinner, at Manly, Federal Minister
Mahon assured State Premier Wade of his profound re-
spect and admiration, and so forth. In reply Wade ex-
plained that so long; as the Australian Government
adopted his views on State Frights it would find him a
very easy man to get on with.
WADE (to Mahon): “ Yes, my little hoy, so long
as you keep your face nicely washed and do
everything I tell you, things’ll be all right
between us.”
Westralia is staggering in the beer-soaked
wake of Maoriland, as it were, and is wildly
waving a dead marine. Last week the irrepres-
sible Government of Newton Moore raised its
poor, sick head just to murmur “ Fill ’em up
agen.” This time it is a mere trifle, a new loan of
£1,445,000, which ought to keep the State in a
reasonable condition of hiccup for a while. Yet
Westralia will wake up some morning sobered.
Something happened in Melbourne the
other day which is calculated to make Maoriland
and other wild borrowers and boomsters feel as
though a glacier was crawling down their spine.
Just when the Melbourne boom was getting into
its stride the N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency
Co. sold a grain and wool store with a 198 ft.
frontag-e to Collins-street, west end, for £210,000.
Shortly afterwards the property was passed on to
ex-Premier James Munro’s Real Estate Bank for
£265,000. Last week, after being carefully nursed
for 17 years, it was sold at what is reckoned the
very fair price of £50,000.
British War-Minister Haldane has been
scoffing at the slack individual who “amuses
himself, but does nothing for his country ” in the
way of defence; and, considering that London,
with 6,500,000 people—more than one-seventh of
the whole population of the British isles—has
only supplied about 15,500 men to the Territorial
Army, it looks as if Haldane had a right to jeer.
Yet, in reality, he has none. Young men don’t
join the Territorial Army, because, if they do so,
they get the sack. Employers don’t want men
who have to get a few hours’ leave every now and
then for drill. If training were compulsory the
employer would have to put up with the dis-
ability, because all young men would have the
same drawback ; but owing to persons like Hal-
dane it isn’t compulsory, therefore the young man
who volunteers loses his job and the one who
doesn’t volunteer gets it. Probably the voung
man would like compulsory training as a break in
the shop or office routine, but he can’t get it; he
only gets Haldane’s foolish scoff. Haldane ,says
in his bitterness that “a short, sharp Act off Par-
liament in war-time ” may compel the slack person
“to do his duty in the matter of home defence ”
—in other words, he will be rushed to the front
at the last moment, Untrained, and not knowing
one end of his gun from the other. A? brilliant
man is Haldane-
A 25-Year-Old Razor. — To have stood the
test of fierce competition for 25 years, and to have come
out on top, is no mean record. And this is what the
Plum Razor, for which Messrs. Craig & Aitken, of 654
George Street, Sydney, hold theagencv, has succeeded in
doing. When a reason is sought, the solution is found in-
the fact that the Plum is “ one of the good old sort ” of
razors that have never sacrificed qualitv for cheapness,
and that can be depended on at all times to maintain a
consistently keen edge under all climatic conditions.
Its blade is of pure Silver Steel—the finest metal known
to the trade, and the forging is done by the good old-
fashioned hand method that existed before the cheaper
processes came into being. The man who decides upon
the Plum for his next razor will experience the delights
of a cool, easy shave whenever he requires it. The price
is the Strictly reasonable one of 10/6, posted free any-
where, and the agents, Messrs. Craig & Aitken, offer to
purchasers a guarantee for two years, for which period
they will also keep the Plum in good shaving order.*

national polities should read “The Commonwealth

and war consequences with a masterly hand.

Josiah Thomas, P.M.G., billed as a Sun-
day Sydney Domain orator, gives political tone to
a much-decayed form of open-air mouth exercise.
The Domain was one time a recognised arena for
the Sunday afternoon discussion of the politics of
the week, and such men as George Dibbs,
Deniehy, Parkes apd Robertson did not think it
beneath them to occupy a stump. But when
noisy religionists invaded the place, politics, ex-
cept of the wilder type, retired, and for years
even the most unconventional members of Parlia-
ment kept off the grass.

BALLADE OF THE BORROWERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking at the National Show at Busselton (W.A )
Mr. Mitchell, the Minister of Agriculture, said that'the
Government was seriously handicapped in developmental
works by want of funds. The only way out of the diffi-
cultv was to borrow.
Mr. John Forrest said he was delighted with the san-
guine tone of Mr. Mitchell’s speech. They should borrow
all they could.—Neivs item.
Hark ! What does the statesman say?
“ Borrow, brothers, borrow.”
In the good old spendthrift way,
Heedless of To-morrow.
Blow To-morrow ! Dash Next Week 1
In a manner mild and meek,
Let us Uncle Isaac seek,
He will help us borrow.
Uncle Isaac won’t refuse
Help to us -who borrow ;
We will sign his I O U’s
Dated for To-morrow—
Who’ll redeem ’em ? Let the Kids !
What we want is quids—bright quids—
We will do as Forrest bids ;
Brothers, let us borrow !
Brothers, let us to the Yids,
To the Yids to borrow ;
Leave the paying to the Kids,
Let theirs be the sorrow ;
Let them pay what has been lent
To their pa (and duly spent)
At the rate of shent per shent—
Borrow, brothers, borrow.
L’Envoi.
We must borrow all we can,
Damn our children’s sorrow ;
Let’s keep on as we began—
Borrow, borrow, borrow !

PALE, LISTLESS
GROWING GIRLS
Young Sydney Woman tells how
she Overcame Anaemia
during her Girlhood.
Every mother of a growing girl should know
what anaemia is, and how to recognise it. It is
one of the commonest complaints of growing girls
and one of the most dangerous, because their de-
velopment makes extra demands on the blood, and
there is always the tendency if neglected, that it
may run into consumption.
Anaemia is simplya lack of blood.. Its approach
is so stealthy that it is often well developed be-
fore it is recognised. Paleness, listlessness, head-
aches airad sideaches, weakness in the limbs, breath-
lessness on the slightest exertion are amongst the
earliest symptoms. If steps be not taken to
renew the blood supply, pernicious antemia and
often a decline follow.
_ For renewing the blood supply there is nothing
like Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. The great Cana-
dian doctor whose experiments resulted in their
production, aimed at embodying in pill form,
something that would make new blood and
strengthen the nerves, recognising that, with
strong nerves and a healthy blood supply, people
could have very few complaints. How well he
succeeded the fame of the pills bears out.
In the case of Mrs. Edward Curran, 46 Lawson
Crescent, Alexandria, Sydney, after suffering
severely with anaemia during girlhood, she found a
complete cure in Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People.
4- I got very run down and was ailing off and on
for a long time,” said Mrs. Curran. “I lost my
appetite completely; the daintiest food didn’t
tempt me. I always had a sick bilious feeling
after eating. The food lay on my chest and gave
me a pain between my breast bone and shoulder
blades, and I’d feel thoroughly miserable. If I
started to read a book my sight would be blurred.
On a hot day I’d feel more upset than ever. I’d
be so utterly tired I could hardly drag along or
do a bit of housework. I rarely got a night’s good
sleep. I’d be so restless and toss about for hours.
My tongue was rough and furred and my mouth
had a vile metallic taste. As to color, that went
altogether, and my skin turned quite brown. I’d
nearly always wake up with a severe headache,
and be drowsy all day. At last I tried Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. They did me good from the
first. They started by improving my appetite
and taking away that heavy choking feeling in
my chest. I kept on taking them and bit by bit
my headaches left me. My color improved and
I quite lost the worn, tired feeling. I began to get
good sound sleep and wake up fresh and clear.
My health since has been splendid.”
When you ask for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
don’t be put off with anything else. Go where
you can get the genuine with Dr. Williams’ name
on the outside Wrapper; it’s the genuine that cures.
Price 2s. !)d. a box, or six boxes for 15s. 3d. To be
had of storekeepers and chemists, or sent direct
by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia,
Ltd., Sydney.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
N.S.W.-Victoria final match was an amazing
circumstance, but dreary withal. In the first inninos
N.S.W. smacked and slashed unmercifully, and, by
making 815, broke its own inter-State record of 805 for a
single innings. The previous record was made by the
N.S.W. XI. at Melbourne in 1905. In the smashin" - of the
recordNobledidgood work, tottingup 213, which, although
a gigantic score, was still far from a record. Consider-
ably higher scores have been made in club cricket, such
as the 1074 made by the Melbourne University Club in
March, 1898; the 922 put up by Carlton in 1896, and
others in both Britain and Australia. The Victorian
answer to the crushing 815 was 468 in the first innings
and 487 in the second innings, which left N.S.W.
only 141 to make to win; and it got them for
the loss of four wickets. Considering the fearsome
start of N.S.W. it was anything but a disgraceful defeat
and showed the solid grit of the Victorians. They
gave no chances, and played the game coolly and without
sign of funk or despair. They looked like men with a
heavy job on hand settling down to do it or burst. They
failed, but were not disgraced.
The previous aggregate record was the 1739
piled up by N.S.W. and Stoddart teams at Sydney Cricket
Ground in February, 1898. This time the contending
teams put up 1911 between them. The gate receipts
soared up to £1233, and the smile on the face of the
N.S.W.O.A. grew daily more expansive. It wanted the
money very badly.
Leaving the old ’uns out of it, the feature of the
match was the batting of the two left-handed colts Rans-
ford and Bardsley. Ransford’s double effort of 182 and 110
climbs amongst the dizzy heights of double-century re-
cords of Australia—the land of cricket giants ; while
Bardsley smacked together 192 and 24 in a manner that
can, without hysterics, be pronounced promising. Aus-
tralian XI. teams of later years have always been rich in
left-handers ; and now that Joseph Darling and Clem
Hill have about faded out, Bardsley and Ransford carry
on the tradition.
fhe match blew to pieces many bowling reputa®
tions. Right through the piece the bat beat the ball with
weary monotony. The only trundler who showed repre-
sentative form was J. C. Barnes, of N.S.W. ; he gathered
in six inter-State wickets for 59 runs and five for 147—11
wickets of the 29 for 206. He is a curly bowler who
heaves the leather with many strange twists and much
deceit, and slays his batsmen by deft trickery instead of
by brute force, as Cotter does. If Barnes maintains his
in the Australian XI. v. the Best of Australia
Sin certainly have a chance of lifting - one of the
i. 600 swag's of English money there has been so much
wrangling over.
The above prophecy should be almost a cer-
tainty; for if ever there was need for a bowler it is now.
Consider the efforts of some of our alleged “ bests ” in
» 6 S™ upheaval: Cotter, four for 175 ; Saunders, two
for 206 ; Armstrong, three for 128; Laver, one for 113;
Vernon, two for 202 ; Hazlitt, two for 151; Emery, two
for 140 ; Hopkins, 0 for 108. These be our best bowlers !
A pretty crowd to send abroad.

Although he has announced his retirement from
cricket often and vigorously, Clementine Hill has always
returned snuling to the pitch, with his flannels drawn a
trifle tighter across his girth on each succeeding occasion.
Now that he has elevated his back and declined a job in
the Australian XI. he practically steps out. He started
in the international cricket trade in 1896, and this will be
the first time he has missed a trip to the Cold Country.
But it is like the case of the man who tries to shoot across
the front of the tram, and misses. He goes out for ever.
And nothing so ill-befitted Hill’s long cricket career as the
unseemly squabble for the cash that preceded his leaving
it. He commenced the cricket industry earl}' and leaves it
still a comparatively young man.
Grade cricket in Sydney on Saturday produced
a sudden burst of g*reat splendor. No less than five men
scored the century and over: A. C. Mackenzie, 165 ;
Norman Deane, 121; S. H. Emery, 120; E. L. Waddy,
115; and L. Blundell, 105. Among the bowlers the best
were Cotter’s seven for 38, A. J. Bowden’s three for 35,
J. C. Barnes’ three for 49, S. H. Emery’s four for 59, and
Bamford’s four for 72. After that, mediocrity and failure.
It was the concluding day of a round. Waverley
beat University by 207 runs on the first innings. Uni. had
accumulated a miserable 178 in the first attempt, and
Waverley smothered it with 385, of which Mackenzie’s 165
was a valuable portion. Mac. was in great form. The
trouble is that occasionally he just gets tired, and then
he s horrible. North Sydney downed Balmain by 110 runs
on the first innings, closing with seven wickets down for
292 against Balmain’s poor 182. Deane’s 121 was a useful
contribution to the North Sydney total. Burwood’s glorv
has indeed faded, and its tail is long in the dust, when
Middle Harbor beats it bj' 73 on the first innings.
The figures were 274 and 347 respectively. At Parramatta
Glebe fell on Central Cumberland and wiped it out with
a first-innings margin of 162 runs—266 to 104. The
struggle between Gordon and Petersham was closer;
Gordon made 206 to Petersham’s 294, leaving Petersham
top dog with 88 to the good. Sydney and Bedfern dunno
exactly where they are, owing to some of the scoring
books not balancing. However, there doesn’t seem to be
very much doubt that Bedfern won by five wickets. It
could hardly be otherwise, as Sydney never wallops any-
body.
The result of the upheaval was to leave Glebe
still cock of the competition with 16 points ; Waverley
has 10, Central Cumberland 8, and after Cumberland the
figures drop to too blushful a depth to be advertised.

That stupendous water carnival, N.S.W. Anni-
versary Begatta, came off on Tuesday week last, and was
generally considered a howling, frantic success. Cer-
tainly it was a charming day, with a fine breeze from
E.N.E., coming along occasionally in little spiteful puffs
which quickly thinned the lubbers out and put even the
best of craftsmen on their mettle. As usual, the P. and
O. liner was flagship ; this time it was the new 11,000-ton
Morea that filled the bill, and it was crowded in every part.
Honors were fairly well divided among the representative
boats. Queensland craft Violet won the double event in
the 14ft. class, during the first race of which the
Westralian boat Elma turned turtle. The Sydney boat
Mvra carried off the double event in the 10ft. class, and
Saxton’s beautiful Awanui, the fastest yacht in
Sydney Harbor, easily romped home with the champion-
ship and the 10-metres-and-over section ; while Petrel,
champion for many 3 r ears, maintained the sovereignty in
the Below-10-metres section, beating J. O. Fairfax’s
imported model Magic. Charles Belph did well in
motor boat events, scoring one win and one second. In-
vincible, starting from scratch, beat Mr. Henry’s
Wegiheh, although conceding 21min. 56sec. in the eight-
mile run. Whatmore’s luck was out, and his Baby Im-
perial, the new hydroplane, unfortunately broke down.
It was a bad day for anything of the hydroplane class.
In the other division, Belph’s Magic, a boat whose engines
he designed and constructed prior to the creation of the
Invincible, was beaten by Mr. Sanderson’s G.E.S.S., which
had 9Jmin. start. G.E.S.S. won by Imin. 41see. The
distance was four miles.
N.S.W. Motor Boat Club still plods along its
uneventful way. The chief end of the body now is to
hold Venetian Night Entertainments, and they are fine
things—from a social point of view. The next will be
held in Gore Bay on Saturday, February 6, and during the
afternoon there will be a series of races for three classes.
Gipsy tea rages from 5.30 to 7.30 p.m., after which the
entertainment and the band will hold the fort. The club
looks forward to having an eventful day—or evening.
There were 35 boats at the last upheaval, and 28 were
decorated in a becoming manner with Chinese lanterns
and colored lights. This time it is hoped that 50 will be
present, and that all will be decorated.
After all, the aggressive Australian cannot get
very enthusiastic about the Motor Boat Club. Its mem-
bers own, roughly, £72,000 worth of boats and engines,
and some of the boats are beautiful craft; but of this
vast mass of industrial produce less than 6 per cent, are
engined with Australian-made motors. Of course, the
boats are Australian-built—and, as said before, some of
them are really beautiful craft.
* * * *
More than possible that big Ben Thoroughgood
will have to forfeit the sculling championship of N.S.W.
through inability to raise the cash to cover Pearce’s de-
posit. The challenger’s money has been up about a month
now, and Thoroughgood is still struggling to get his
stake together. The Baymond Terrace crowd of true
sports will not stand to Thoroughgood if he rows any-
where else but on the Hunter Biver, and as the race with
Pearce has been fixed for the Parramatta they have but-
toned up their pockets. No wonder sculling ’is decadent
in Australia when the champion of the State cannot find
backers to put up the modest sum now asked for.
“0.K.”: After what had been heard from
Sydney and Brisbane of “ boy ” Gray’s wonderful pre-
cocity at billiards, the display he gave against Lindrum in
their Melbourne game was disappointing to the critics.
True, he made a record red-hazard break of 500 odd, and
his Strength and accuracy of aim in hazard striking were
equally remarkable. But at every other class of stroke
he was an amateur by comparison with Lindrum, who is
not more than two years his senior, it is said. He fre-
quently failed in his “ forcing losers ” through thumping
the ball. Apparently he had no idea of running up a big
break by other means than the one mechanical stroke
which he has practised assiduously. He made 30 or 40
consecutive “losers” off the red (in one of his second-
best breaks) all the time that his opponent’s white was in
admirable position for bringing the two balls into top-of-
the-table play with a cannon ; and when he broke down
it was through playing at the losing hazard in a difficult
way instead of resorting to the easy cannon. The fact of
Gray being so tied to this particular system of scoring
(which is, next to the obsolete spot stroke, the easiest of
all the systems) suggests that he has no special talent for
shaping a policy. Lindrum may never be a champion of
champions—he strikes me as not having the necessary
physique or “character ” —but he should within the next
year or two widen the gap that separates him from the
young specialist.

Motor-racing, which has been a gold mine to the
cinematograph man, is fading out in Europe, all the lead-
ing firms of the continent having signed a bond of £4OOO
not to compete in this year’s Grand Prix. So probably
the Grand Prix will die suddenly. Future events of the
kind will be restricted to reliability trials. The roads
will be a lot safer in some parts of Europe henceforth.
The Dunlop Rubber Co. has now mapped out
the course of the Dunlop Adelaide-to-Sydney Relay Ride,
and divided the journey into 63 sections, the longest of
which is that across the Coorong Desert of 38J miles.
As there are two riders to each section, the total force
will consist of 126 cyclists. The ride will be opened by
Baulderstone and Richards, of Adelaide, and concluded
by long-distance amateur crack E. A. Pearson and T.
Larcombe, the road champion of the Ma State.

A. Humrn, the well-known Maoriland road
rider, who has on several occasions visited Australia to
take part in the Dunlop Road Race from Warrnambool
to Melbourne, and in which he has registered some very
fine performances (including a third in 1906), has just
established a great performance by lowering Andy
Calder’s long-standing cycle record from Christchurch to
Dunedin. Hunun, who rode “ Dunlops,” covered the 247
miles of mountainous country in 18 hours 20 minutes,
some four hours 19 minutes faster than Calder’s record.*

The inter-State open boat competitions came to
an end in Sydney on Saturday last, when Myra, of Port
Jackson, won the 10ft. championship by 2min. 9sec. from
Queensland Irene. Myra led right round the course, and
at no time was it seriously challenged. The 14-ft. Inter-
State Handicap w'as also won by a Sydney boat, J. Smith’s
Rene, which beat Botany Bay flyer St. George by 15sec.

Frank Gotch, who was accused by Hacken-
schmidt of foul and brutal tactics, has been getting him-
self disliked by the gentlemen who call themselves
“ the real sports.” Seems that lately an Orien-
tal party hight Yousiff Mahmout, or something
like that, calling himself “The Terrible Turk” (all
Turkish wrestlers appear to be Terribles), bobbed
up and requested the pleasure of putting Gotch’s
shoulders against the mat. Gotch assumed a haughty
attitude, and told the Turk to go out and get himself a
reputation before making requests like that. Mahmout
went out, and, catching another Yankee named Jenkins,
an alleged wrestler of credit and renown, fell upon him,
shifted two of his ribs, and finally crushed him into sub-
mission and insensibility. When thev hauled him off his
victim the Turk was amazed to find lie had hurt the man,
and explained that he had not squeezed hard because the
Amurkan didn’t struggle. Then Gotch sailed for England
with great suddenness, and failed to notice the purse for
10,000 dollars that someone had hung out as an induce-
ment. Gotch simply Got.

The Metropolitan Rifle Association’s prize
meeting, at Rand wick (Sydney) last week, failed a trifle
so far as shooting at the fixed target was concerned ; and
the only “ possible ” was put up by VV. W. Smith, with 10
shots at 800yds. At the 900yds. range, N. Pettigrew’s
score of 48 was on top ; while at lOOOvds. F. Atkins and
W. C. Coulter came off with the best scores of 46 each.
The majority of the shootists evidently suffered from the
distance of the object to be fired at and the gauging of
the rifle. In the “ running man ’’—eight shots at 300yds.
nine shootists hit the inanimate object with every bul-
let; and at the “disappearing disc”—eight shots at
1 3 r, ? emen never failed. The meeting showed
that the shootists had a better chance at a disappearing'
target than at a stationary one, and that is a good sign
of practical rifle-shooting.

The bowls fever has caught on very seriously in
Victoria, and 147 entries have poured in for the single-
handed championship of the State. Everywhere there
are budding champions, and the return visit to N.S.W.
this year is set down as a time for upheaval and revenge,

Victorian Lawn Tennis Association is in a state
of high glee, fondly caressing a credit balance of £BO3.
The Murray-State association reaped £350 from the
season’s inter-State tourney; and the windfall will
possibly be spent in fostering the game. There is room
for extension and for encouraging young Australians to
defend the recently-acquired Davis Cup.

A shrewdly-planned coup resulted successfully
at the recent A.J.C. Anniversary meeting. Directly the
weights were known, Foley and McGrath, the astute
trainers of Neith and Plunder respectively, with a couple
of others, gathered in all double money going about
Neith for the Challenge Stakes and Plunder for the Anni-
versary Handicap, taking as little as hundreds to three
before shutting up. The excellence of the judgment was
evidenced by the triumph of both nags, though each had
little more than an eyelash, a nose, or something of the
kind to the good. Bred in N.S.W., Plunder has
done the greater part of his racing in Queensland,
where he appropriated the May Day Cup, King’s Plate,
Brisbane Cup and other remunerative things. His latest
win was similar to the Brisbane Cup success, when he led
from end to end of the trip ; but Yabba Gabba (14 to 1)
nearly upset the “pot,” and finished close enough to be
just beaten, and no more.
Jack Smith, winner of the Hobart Cup last
week, didn t score out of his turn. Four wins in four
seasons isn’t much for the nag’s owners (the Messrs.
Clarke) to jubilate over, though two of the previous suc-
cesses were the Bond Cup and the V.R.C. Autumn
Handicap.

Cleverly-laid plans were completely upset in
the Park States at Canterbury, Sydney, on Saturday,
when the bottled-up 4-year-old Mozart-Mirabelle geld-
ing, Merei, was freed, and money was heaped on him till
evens was the best price. Hopelessly out of it in the
earlier part of the race through being badly placed,
Merei (who had only just been named) put in a meteoric
finish from the home turn, to be just beaten by 20-to-l-
-chance Plaiden. It is because of the frequency of such
happenings that Ikey Mo is sleek and his loot bag weighty.
Years ago Jack Murray was the recognised
leader of the Totalisator movement in Vic. Assembly.
He used to introduce a Tote Bill periodicals, and Frank
Madden, the present Mr. Speaker, used to denounce it on
behalf of the V.R.C. committee. Nowadays Madden
would vote for a Tote Bill on behalf of the racing club
but Premier Murray is not likely to father one. ’

Merman, the Australian horse that Mrs
Langtry bought from the late W. R. Wilson, and won
some big races with in England, has gone to Germany to
beget high-class cavalry horses and hunters from half-
bred mares. Merman, in his old age, seems to have
acquired a great name for hardness. As a racehorse sire
he was not a brilliant success, but his stock have in-
herited his sound constitution and sturdy legs.
Australia is now rapidly solidifying into one
concrete nation. The latest move is to bring together
all the State governing horse racing clubs, and elect a
Federal governing body, which shall control the registra-
tion of horses and the future publication of the Australian
Stud Book. The idea is to have a strong, practically
omnipotent body, which will exercise a general control,
while leaving purely local matters for the State governing
clubs. One of the worries at present is the duplication
of names and an enormous mass of correspondence
between clubs, which the establishment of a central
governing body will do away with.

Stanley Ketchel announces that, having re-
sumed the championship business at the old stand, he
will be glad to accommodate Mister Johnson. Stanley is
rapidly getting out of the middle-weight division, but
writer thinks he will still have to grow a bit before he can
safely talk to Mistah Johnsing.

A line as to the feebleness of the local assault-
vendors by comparison with those who do business else-
where may be got from the doings (21/12/’08) of Sam
Langford in San Francisco. Samuel there engaged Jim
Flynn, who last year accounted for Bill Squires. Says an
exchange:—
“After two minutes of fighting, Langford feinted with
his right. Like a flash he brought his left flush to the
fireman’s jaw, with an impact that was heard all over the
house. Flynn dropped as if hit with a log, his face turned
purple, and he rolled on his back until the pain from the
blow caused him to turn. The count of 10 was tolled off,
but Flynn was too far gone to even hear the count. He
remained helpless on the floor of the ring with his seconds
working- over him for fully two minutes. He was then
carried to his corner, and it was five minutes before his
senses returned.
Langford is sft. 7£in., and weighs but lOst. 21b.
The Americans are marvellous people. Three
months ago, they were yelping at Tommy Burns with one
united yelp to drop his nonsense about the color line and
face Brother Johnson like a man. Jim Jeffries yelped in
this regard as loudly and as persistently as any of them.
When the U.S. heard that Thomas was really going" to
meet the Black Agony they were pleased. They started
forecasting the result of the event, and many of their
forecasts favored the white champion. Jim Jeffries for
example, went into details on the subject, and
Burns the decision six weeks before the fio-ht on"his
superior footwork, his infighting ability, and” his game-
ness. Now the fickle James says this, which is what 90
per cent, of the other fight fans in Hamland say
“ Tommy Burns’ mistake, the one great mistake of his
career, was in allowing Johnson the opportunity to fight
for the title. I refused time and again to meet Johnson
"’bile I was holding the title, even though I knew I could
beat him. I would never allow a negro a chance to fight
for the world’s championship, and I advise all other
champions to follow the same course. Tomm v Burns has
been vastly overrated as a fighter. This has always been
my belief.”
Of a verity, N. Brusso spoke sooth when he remarked
after the Johnson chastisement, that “ Americans have
no use for a beaten man.” They are the world’s worst
sportsmen.
• * * *
The way O’Brien, Burns and Johnson raked in
money in England and Europe has fired the blood and
pocket of old Bob Fitzsimmons, and the “Freckled
Freak ” is now in the heart of the Empire looking for
what he describes as “lemons.” He is to receive £5OOO
from the National Sporting" Club for a series of four bash-
ing* events ag"ainst whoever the club likes to put up
against him. At time of writing", the names of only Moir
and Roche have been mentioned.
“ Adolphus Attic ” writes :
I beg to advance my limited experience of the colored
person.
For my sins, I have been compelled by Providence to
dwell in a chaotic boarding-house that perches on the
nos.e of a suburban cliff, like a morbid seagull contemplat-
ing suicide. It is not on the brow of the cliff, where the
free winds of Heaven could blow in the back door and
blow out the front, taking - with them the pale-green
smell of cooking ; it is half-way up, so that the back of
the house is jambed against the solid rock like the latter
end of a desperado who has been brought to (Neutral)
bay, and is putting up a last stand against fearful odds
and worse cooking. Hanging precariously over my head
(I have a back room) is a cheap lodging'.house, crammed
with cheap lodgers, and pervaded by a landlady who wears
her hair in curl-papers in the morning and goes
out mysteriously to dine with thp local nobility
at night, clad in a red silk evening dress and a
look of cold scorn. It is one of my favorite
nightmares that the cheap lodging-house will be blown
down some night when the wind is high, and that I will
wake and find mv room filled with broken bricks and
cheap lodgers, and the landlady in the dress that looks
like the burning of London in the days of Charles Two.
However, this is getting away from my own lodging-den,
and my experience of the colored person, who is the oook
thereof, and a proud nigger to boot. (It is on record that
one lodger booted him in the fragrant long ago, but he
was a strong man, and is now dead. Peace to his feet!)
Well, this undesirable alien, who spoils the viands for us,
has an unreasonable prejudice against boiled eggs. 1
love a hard-boiled egg for breakfast, but I can’t obtain it
unless the maid-in-waiting cooks it with her own
fair hands - and a little assistance from the gas
stove. She informs me that, at the mention of- hard-
boiled eggs, the undesirable flies into a fearful passion
and rolls his eyes murderously at the meat-chopper.
Wherefore she finds it easier to do it for me herself.
Although I have been resident in the house now six
months, I have never sighted the cook ; he dwells apart
in the kitchen and is not visible to the undressed eye. If
ever I meet him, I will demand at the point of the carving
knife—which is an incredibly blunt instrument—on what
grounds he refuses to boil my morning egg. I will de-
mand to know if eggs are against his political principles
or if they clash with his religious convictions, and if he
doesn’t give me a satisfactory answer I will carve his tur-
ban into four pieces and throw the four fragments in the
range. I dislike having to take extreme measures, bur
the insolence of this Asiatic with regard to my egg is
driving me to desperation.
In a country of vast distances and scat
tered settlement, where doctors are few and far
between, a reliable medical work is most neces-
sary. It is not intended to take the place of the
doctor, but to tell people what to do till a doctor
can be obtained. Many a valuable life is lost
because people know nothing about the rudiments
of first aid, and by the time a doctor has been
brought 50 miles or so the patient is beyond hope.
To meet this necessity The Bulletin Co. is
issuing a complete set of Dr. P. E. Muskett’s
works, “The Australian Medical Guide,” in two
volumes; “The Attainment of Health,” and
“The Management of Infants,” one vol. each.
The whole set is retailed for the exceedingly
reasonable sum of £3. *
“Adelaide ” : T. Bent has gone now, but
the other day I seemed to find one reason for the
amazing (to outsiders) popularity that kept hint
on top so long. I had to visit Melbourne for an
official function, and I went to it in the regulation
frock coat and tall hat; and I met Bent face to
face outside the building. I had never seen hint
before, and was surprised to find how little The
Bulletin has exaggerated his figure. I will
cheerfully make oath that he didn’t know me
from a bar of soap. Yet I was gaudily clothed.
I might be (though I didn’t happen to be) Some-
one. And I got an unexpected beaming smile
and bow. As already remarked, a habit like that
might go part of the way to explain things.
A STOUSH PATRON SPEAKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill Squires and Bill Lang battle for the heavyweight
championship of Australia on Wednesday, February o.—
News item.
Bill, w’en these few,remarks appears in print
(And unnerstan’ by “ Bill” that William Lang
As well as “ Boshter ” Bill I mean), by dint
Of many a wallop, biff, punch, bash and bang
You—either Lang or Squires, that is to say—
Will have out-fought the other bloque, and won
The proudest title that can come the way
Of local pug—viz., that of Champion.
Willvum, I grant no words in this ere sheet
(Which goes to press on Toosday) can affect
The doings of two lads who’re billed ter meet
The We’n’sday follerin’; yet I reflect
On C. G. Wade, E. Simpson, Rev’rend Ash,
“Father o’ Twelve” and such, and on their pent,
Shocked grief regarding the Burns-Johnson bash ;
And then thoughts come, and will ’ave written vent.
Bill—and I speak alike to ’im who trains
At that ’istoric pub, where flarin’ ramps
(Concocted by sly bike-promoters’ brains)
Once raged as ’ot as cycle-racin’ lamps,
And to the Pride o’ Noocastle—Beware !
Watch ’ow you rouse the Reverend person’s ire !
Do nothin’ coarse on We’n’sday next. The pair
O’ you I urge, as one, not to aspire
To plug the other on the jore or nose—
Which spots, once tapped, are liable to run
With ’orrid gore—nor to direct crool blows
Where they may daze or incommode or stun.
Abandon right-arm jabs, and upper-cuts,
And swings and prods (except in self-defence) ;
Do not arouse the Churchman’s shamed “ Tut-tuts ”
By deeds o’ wild unseemly violence.
Be gentle each with each. Omit to jeer
If Bill smites Bill with such a fierce impact
That he (that’s Bill) falls to the earth. Don’t sneer
If Bill, by Bill, is pushed about and whacked.
The moment that yer spot a drop o’ blood
On self, floor, seconds, posts, or referee
Stop hittin’, Bill, and burst into a flood
Of tears for every pietist to see.
Don’t shove or hustle when you’re in the ring,
Or use rude terms like “ Blow it ail! ” and “ Dash ! ”
Such cuss-words horrify like anything
The looker-on of sanctity and cash.
Be mild and courteous as a little child.
Don’t injure Bill. Look on ’im as a friend.
’Andie ’im gently. Don’t get narked or wild
And knock rents in ’im that may never mend.
But ’old—l’m writin’ on the Toosday eve ;
Ther scrap’s ter-morrer, and these warnin’ lines
Will not appear till Thursday. So I grieve
Me advice is wasted. Futile are me whines.
One partin’ word : If yer both fight like “ beats,”
Clinch, bash, howl, curse, and shame yerselves ter
rights,
Don’t blame the writers in the weekly sheets,
But them that fixes scraps for We’n’sday nights.

BAD BREATH.
THE TONGUE IS THE INDEX.
Your breath is foul, but you do not perceive it
yourself. You are like a person who is always
amonp the oils and varnishes—you get used to what
is to many people a most obnoxious smell. It is most
disagreeable to those with whom you come in con-
tact. A slight headache, a bad breath, and a coated
tongue are the first symptoms of stomachic
disease. Take time by the forelock, and intercept
germination ; arrest the germs ere they develop
into disease. A pill in time may save days of
suffering. Look at your tongue in the looking
glass every night and morning, and if it is at all
discolored take a couple of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. They will remove the objectionable
matter from the stomach, regulate the system and
sweeten the breath. One or two of these pills
taken once or twice a week will ensure a well regu-
lated system, fortified against all disease.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching
remedy, and are a permanent and positive remedy
for biliouness, indigestion, constipation, bad
breath, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples and blotches, and
for all female ailments.

The Age, commenting on the report that
Kaiser William has become a teetotaler, says,
gravely, “The statement is prompted by the fact
that the Kaiser is known to be reducing his personal
expenses.” Which leaves us to infer that William
has been in the habit of drinking several breweries
daily.
Willie Watt, Victoria’s new Treasurer, has
been only 11 years in politics, but it has been a
battle all the time. He first arrived by defeating
Prendergast for North Melbourne, in ’97. Before
another election came round, McLean had taken
him in as P.M.G., and that killed him tem-
porarily. He resurrected in ’O2, for East Mel-
bourne ; but the constituency of Jews and “ pay-
ing guests” didn’t suit him, or he didn’t suit the
constituency, so at the ’O4 redistribution he
tackled Essendon, and has held the seat ever
since,,though with difficulty. Between times he
had a couple of unsuccessful shots at the Senate,
and also tried to be Fat’s nominee for the East
Melbourne seat on Findley’s expulsion. It will
be understood that Labor loves him, even as
Burns loves Johnson, and as long as it has a hope
of success will make him fight for his seat. The
present will be his tenth contest in 11 years. By
profession he is an accountant, though since the
McLean debacle he has been running a hay and
corn business in a north-western suburb.
That family of Smiths of which the just
dead Francis Villeneuve, ex-Chief Justice of Tas-
mania, was a member, simply rained lawyers.
The late Francis V. has two sons at the English
Bar. Francis V.’s younger brother was
William V., for many years Adelaide’s chief
criminal man ; and William Y. was uncle of
Francis Y. 11., who is now fast climbing up to
the place in the ladder that uncle used to occupy.
Also there is a younger William V., who pursues
Costs in -Westralia; and there are other Y.
Smiths who are pursuers of Costs in other places ;
but whose nephews these other V. Smiths are this
writer doesn’t know for certain.
The native-born Australian has not as yet
reached the N.S.W. Chief Justiceship. Matthew
Henry Stephen (born in Hobart) and G. B. Simp-
son (Parramatta) reached to the height of Acting
Chief, but the full office has so far gone to men
from abroad. Two of them, Dowling and Salo-
mons, were born in England ; Martin and Darley
came from Ireland ; Alfred Stephen was born a,t
St. Cristopher in the West Indies, and Francis
Forbes in Bermuda. Martin and Salomons both
arrived here when still young enough to become

Established 25 Years.
The Dropping of the Gentle Tram from
Heaven.
Launceston, in the slow-going isle of Tassy, is
still discussing the proposed establishment of a
tramway system. The question is mostly one as
between municipal and private ownership, and
long years of strugglement have left the matter
still in the air, so to speak. In 1906 a plebiscite
of citizens resulted in 493 votes being cast for
municipal ownership, and 2248 for private owner-
ship, and the majority was so overwhelming that
the matter seemed to be settled. But the first
private syndicate which undertook to do the work
fell through, after the manner of syndicates, and
time rolled on, and Launceston was left still
tramless. Now another syndicate is cruising
round the proposition, but a fear seems to have
arisen in the bowels of the Tory press that all this
delay and muddle niay have led to a revulsion of
feeling in favor of municipal control. Conse-
quently the local Examiner arose, on January 16,
to reassure the public in an enthusiastic article.
After supplying many figures about the proposed
syndicate, it made this remarkable statement: —
We have expressed a favorable opinion of the scheme
because it provides the citizens with what they want
under reasonable conditions. Should the company work
the trams to the end of the 30 years—and we are told it
has never yet defaulted—then the sinking fund will be
sufficient to redeem the debentures, and the installation
becomes the property of the citizens without any cost.
That is the position of the Melbourne corporation, which
in a few years will acquire its tram system, built on a
similar principle, without havingto part with a sixpence.
The last seven words suggest a really astonishing
attitude of mind. The statement, taken in a
large, general way, is a magnificent lie, though
viewed in a small, particular fashion there maybe
shreds of truth about it. The Melbourne trams
do revert to the municipality in 1916. And
then any Melbourne citizen who has never ridden
in the trains, if such a person exists, may own a
share in the property without having paid
a sixpence. Also the citizen who is an in-
veterate tram-rider, but who always goes alone,
and never by any chance takes two girls
with him and pays for the three—he won’t have
paid a sixpence either; at least not in one lot.
But an enormous number of Melbourne citizens
pay, and have paid most of their lives, 4d. a day as
the price of Private Enterprise—that is to say,
that twice a day they pay 3d. to the Melbourne
Private Enterprise tramway extortioners for a
ride which the Sydney State-owned trams supply
for a humble copper. It is so glaringly obvious
that something of this sort must occur that even a
blind asylum could see it, though the Launceston
Examiner apparently can’t. In the first place
the Sydney State-owned tramways are burdened
with a payment of about 3J per cent, on the cost of
construction, that being the interest on the loan
money with which they were built; the Mel-
bourne Private Enterprise trams have to pay about.
24 per cent, on the cost of construction, that being
the dividend on its actually paid-up capital to
which Private Enterprise kindly helps it-
self. Then Private Enterprise doesn’t in-
tend to lose its capital when it hands over
the tramways to the municipalities in 1916 ;
instead it is accumulating such reserves that, when
the trams are handed over and the company
winds up, the shareholders will probably get 30s.
for every £1 they put into the concern—this in
addition to the splendid dividends that have come
their way. Now, as the Melbourne Tramway Co.
has no power to levy a poll-tax on the people of
Jerusalem, or to charge customs duties in Turkey
—as it can’t, in fact, tax anybody save the citizens
of Melbourne—it is plain that the citizens of Mel-
bourne will pay for the trams to the last penny if
they don’t pay for them twice over, and that they
are also, while the company still owns the trams,
paying about 24 per cent, per annum on the
capital invested in the business, whereas under
State or municipal ownership they need never pay
more than 4 per cent. The Launceston Exami-
ner’s picture of a city getting a complete tram-
way system without paying a sixpence for it, all
through the benevolence of Private Enterprise—
having the affair dropped on it like the gentle '
tram from Heaven, so to speak—is very beautiful,
but it is also very thin. The sixpences which
Melbourne has been needlessly and foolishly done
out of through its Private Enterprise tramway
policy are so many that the company’s rolling
stock would hardly be strong enough to carry
them.
Tiie British Freetrader was wont, till quite re-
cently, when his attention was drawn to the
levanting manufacturing industries of his country,
to fall back on the aged gag about the United
Kingdom being “the world’s sea-carrier,” and to
say that the prosperity of the Cold Land’s
delivery-of-goods-by-ship trade was “amazing”
and “unparalleled,” if nothing else was. A
Reuter’s message (16/l/’O9) suggests powerfully
that, under the Cobden regime, even this avenue
of profit is getting moss-grown and weedy and
generally blocked up. Said Reuter :
Sir Walter Runciman, senior partner of the firm of
Walter Runciman and Co., shipowners, of Newcastle-
on-Tyne, who was chairman of the meeting, stated that
nearly 2,000,000 tons of shipping were idle, and that
dividends had dropped nearly £30,000,000.
Another speaker said that shipowners were short of a
living freight by £23,500,000.
It is not that they are building too many ships in
Britain. On the contrary, month by month the
tonnage under construction in the British Isles
grows less and less. Last year’s total was, accord-
ing to Lloyd’s, Register, 733,37B tons—the lowest
recorded for over a decade. The previous year’s
total was 1,080,378 tons, a difference of 347,000
tons. The main trouble is that Britain is manu-
facturing less goods for export, and that the
foreign protected countries are not only making
more goods, but are also building the ships to
carry them in. It is a state of affairs that is con-
trary to all the rules laid down by Cobden half-a-
century ago. In those golden days of skite Cob-
den assured the British public that it was as cer-
tain as next day’s sunrise that within ten years
all the civilised nations of the world would be
Freetrade. And there Cobby fell in horribly—in
fact, his ghost has never got out of the hole to this
day.
One reason why the Australian postal department
is short of money is its excessive desire to supply
the public with cheap services. It began this
system in a misguided effort to disarm criticism
at the time when it was the fashion among all the
State Fright papers to denounce at large unless
the Commonwealth gave twice the service that
the States used to do, and charged only half the
money. Now the State Fright papers are wailing
a different tune, hence it came to pass the other
day that Sydney Evening News published this
comparison of telephone charges per annum (for a
’phone not more than two miles from the ex-
change, one instrument, 2000 outward calls per
annum, and all inward calls free): —
Philadelphia .. .. .. £24 15 0
New York 21 16 0
Boston .. .. .. .. 21 15 0
Baltimore .. .. . _ 20 10 0
St. Louis .. .. .. 19 5 0
Chicago.. .. .. .. 16 16 0
London .. ~ .. .. 13 6 8
Germany .. .. .. 9 10 0
Australia .. .. .. 5 0 0
No wonder the, Australian Postal Department is
feeling at the bottom of its pocket for loose change
to build extensions with.
“Mate” : I hope The Bulletin is keeping its
eye on the appointment of officers to the Com-
monwealth Navy. One of the conditions is Aus-
tralian residence, but according to report this
condition is not being observed. We would be
hard put to it to get Australians, because so few
of them go to sea. This is a pity, seeing how
dependant we are on the coaster fleet, but it is
not to be wondered at when you consider the hard
conditions and poor prospects of sailorising. How-
ever, there are plenty of men on the coast ships,
good Australians at heart, and mostly married to
Australian girls, thoroughly up to date, and capa-
ble of taking a place in the Commonwealth Navy
right away. Yet the first appointments are going
to men who come out of deep-water ships from
England. These men may be efficient, and the
lines they belong to have more social glamor than
our coasting companies care about playing up to.
But they haven’t the Australian sentiment, nor the
close knowledge of Australian conditions that are
as necessary as a year’s training in the British
Navy and the latest accent. I think it very hard
that our coasting men—who haven’t time in the
rush of the Australian trade to cultivate the
powers that be—should be passed over for out-
siders whose fathers happened to be friendly with
authority in their youth, or whose brass buttons
caught the eye of Mrs. or Miss Authority when
they went “’Ome.”

Grand Prix and Two Gold Medals,
London, 1908.
ADDITIONAL AWARD.
We have just received intimation from the Commissioner-General of the h ranco-British
Exhibition that we have been awarded
THE DIPLOMA OF HONOR
in addition to those awards already advertised.
The Diploma of Honor is next to the Grand Prix the highest awaid.
.These awards are the highest ever made to any pianos at any Exhibition. This
makes five distinct awards to the Beale Pianos, viz. :
Grand Prix for tonal qualities and general excellence.
Diploma of Honor for ironwork in pianos (iron frame and other castings).
Gold Medal for excellence in cabinet work.
Gold Medal for factory organisation.
Silver Medal for brass castings.
It is impossible to bring stronger proof that Beale Pianos are of the highest
possible quality. We do not and will not make low-class instruments. Eveiy piano
turned out' from our factory is guaranteed for twenty-five years, and therefore it would be
suicidal for us to make anything but faultless instruments.
We have sold over ELEVEN THOUSAND Beale Pianos throughout Aus-
tralia and other parts of the World, and everywhere they are giving the greatest satisfaction.
Inspect the Beale Pianos for yourself, and you will be thoroughly satisfied that they
are all we claim them to be. If you cannot call, send foi catalogue and information.
We sell direct from factory to family, on easy terms, or for cash. Beale Pianos,
although of the highest quality, are not high-priced, for by making every detail ourselves
and selling direct to the family, we save many profits.

AUSTRALIAN
MEDICAL
HOUSEHOLD
LIBRARY.
There are people in this country who have no doctor within a
hundred miles of them . Even in the places that are reckoned
fairly settled the lack of medical assistance is most appalling .
THE BULLETIN places these volumes on the market with the special idea of meeting the needs of those who
are out of the reach of medical assistance.
M ldioal Needs of Port Stephens. In connection with the lack of facilities for obtaining medical aid at Port Stephens, Mr. W. Moore,
a resident of Nelson s Bay, writes : In the whole of this large area there is no doctor nearer than Stockton, about 30 miles
distant, and the fee charged for attending a patient is in addition to which the hire of a steam launch has to be added,
making it £l3 a visit. In one instance lately, the child of a fisherman was taken seriously ill. The doctor attended, and
next day had again to be summoned to visit the child’s mother, making the fees and travelling expenses for two short
visits, which seems a large sum for a fisherman to pay. Others in need of medical aid are quite unable to afford it, and it
certainly seems high time for tile Government to take steps in the matter.— Sydney Morning Herald, October 5, 1908.

TAKE DRUGS!
WHY don’t you stop it? You are still doctoring, but changing doctors does not cure
you. You are trying one medicine after the other with the same disgusting disappoint-
ment. You are a “ medicine doser,” and the only change in your condition is for the worse.
Why don’t you stop this medicine habit ? Why don’t you avail yourself of
the modern remedy ? Proceed on Nature’s own lines. Use the life-giving, healing,
strengthening forces of Electricity ! This is the electric age. You can see on every
hand the wonders of Electricity. You don’t need doctors ; you don’t need medicine,
for medicine gives no nourishment. You DO need Electric Life Force. Use it as we
apply it and you will be well, strong and happy
Nearly every ailment which afflicts humanity, outside of contagious diseases, is due to the breaking-
down of some vital organ. When a certain part fails to do its allotted task the entire human
machinery goes to smash. The only way to regain health—even life —is to rebuild the weak part
which has caused all the trouble by obtaining a new supply of vital electric energy. This can
only be properly done with the new improved
DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT.
There is no disputing the virtue in Electricity as a cure for weakness and pains. The brainiest doctors living now admit it, but there has
been a doubt that anyone had mastered the best way of applying it. The doctor’s battery is crude—shocks too much, and at best can only be
applied for half-an-hour at a time, which is not enough to do any good. Those other machines in a doctor’s office never reach the trouble. . .
Electricity, as applied by DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT, is the modern, up-to date method. No shock, no burning or
blistering, and you wear it for hours at a time while sleeping or during the day.
£5OO REWARD.
Wo guarantee every Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt sold by us to give a powerful current of
genuine electricity which can he instantly felt, and we will forfeit JSSOO to anyone proving
the contrary.
It is a quick and lasting cure for Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Weak Back, Sciatica,
Lumbago, Indigestion, Weak Kidneys, Failing Memory, and all evidence of Break-Down.

Name.
The dormant commission which, provided
there is no Lieutenant-Governor, enables the head
of N.S.W. judicature to act in a large vice-regal
manner during the Governor’s absence from the
State, was the cause of a notable shindy in the
days of Hercules Robinson. Hercules the horsey
went off with Joseph George Innes to annex Fiji,
leaving Parkes Premier and Martin Chief Justice.
Adso The left Mrs. Robinson at Government
House. The Governor had barely got outside
the Heads when Martin smilingly (and, though
a bit of a bully, Martin could smile a fasci-
nating smile on occasions) interviewed Parkes and
asked him to wake up the dormant commission,
as he and his wife had packed a few things to
take with them to Government House. Nothing
in life gave Parkes more joy than disappointing a
Society climber, so he made a slight delay and
took counsel with Mrs. Robinson. What passed
between them is unknown, but it is on record that
Parkes came out with his mane waving in the
breeze and a lot of joy in his wicked little
eyes. Then Mrs. Robinson declared that
if the Martins came she would go—out into
the night, over the sea, to England ; nay, to
Ireland. The Martins didn’t go to Government
House, and with all possible speed the Colonial
Office sent out a commission appointing ex-Chief
Justice Stephen Lieutenant-Governor, which office
he held all through the life of Martin.

Our Unfinished Commonwealth
(r
V=-- .- •
HE amount of aid which Australia can expect from the Motherland is necessarily limited, and Australia
must be largely dependent upon herself for defence.” —Lord Northcote, in London.
The popular impression that the Commonwealth owns the whole of the Continent of Australia is
quite wrong. One-sixth of it is really an empty land protected only by a flag, and, in the words of
S.A. Premier Price, “a fluttering flag does not constitute effective occupation.” For the safety of the
Australian Nation the whole Continent must be acquired, and the empty spaces garrisoned. In this
matter Australia stands alone, and the times are dangerous.
Read “Why” and “How,” by C. A. Jeffries, commencing in this February LONE HAND.


IN BANANA LAND
“Moorabinda”: Touching on the recent
pars, re alligators. The Fitzroy (Q.) is (or was
years ago) the most southern water in Australia
in which these brutes are (or were years ago)
found, but from there up to Cape York the rivers
and creeks are (or were years ago) full of them.
Why they are called alligators no one knows, for
the formation of their jaws and the shape of their
heads distinctly prove them to be crocodiles.
They have a great fancy for dogs in the way of
food when they can get them, but their diet ex-
tends over a varied range, from a full-grown
cow to a paving stone. On one of the
plantations on the Pioneer an alligator was
seen to perform a feat which gives some
idea of the enormous strength which these brutes
possess. The milking cows belonging to the
plantation used to go down every morning to the
river to drink. The bank was rather steep, and
the water just there deepened very quickly. As
one of the cows was standing drinking, with her
forelegs in the water, an alligator came up and
caught her by the nose, and, in spite of the
animal’s struggles, held firmly on, and succeeded
m dragging her down into the damp, dark
depths. The cow was never seen again.
With regard to the paving stones, no one
seems to know whether they are taken
in for ballast or to assist digestion, or
to fill a vacufim caused by hunger ; but it is a very
common thing to find half-a-dozen stones, each
double the size of a man’s fist, in the stomach of
an alligator. The ’gators on the Pioneer generally
grow to an enormous size. One killed there not
long after I arrived, measured 19ft. long, but even
this was eclipsed by “ Big Ben,” of the Fitzroy •
he measured 23£ft. When last 1 heard of him he
was in the possession of Mr. Jamrach, of London.
These alligators do not seem to increase much in
numbers, and they hang about the same pools for
years. From October to March, during the hot
season, they do not show themselves at all but
during the rest of the year they lie about on
the sandbanks all day, sunning themselves.
“ Myrtle,” from Queensland ;
When Bananaland Treasurer Hawthorne put through the
last bunch of estimates, there was omitted the usual vote
of £lO,OOO as a reward for the person who discovers a per-
manent eradicator of prickly-pear. Though there are
plenty of advertised remedies, all declared fit and willing
to Johnsonise the spiny curse in less than 14 rounds,
no one has yet claimed that £lO,OOO, and things are just
where they used to be—excepting the pear, which is in
many places now where it used not to be.
Can any one tell me a place where the wretched thing
won’t grow? I was recently camped for a month on
North Keppel Island, and one day a sudden spasm of
energy, due to oysters and ozone, induced me to climb to
the culminating point of the mountains there. The ulti-
mate roof of things was a high peak, exposed to the direct
force of a full Pacific wind and storm, and (barring one
thing) it was as bald on top as a Tory legislator. The bald-
ness (barring one thing) was about half a mile square.
Centuries of gales had even dragged out the grass roots.
But there, in all its spreading glory, the sole specimen of
plant life on the lofty premises, grew one big clump of
prickly pear. And this island is 13 miles from the main-
land.
In Central Queensland the cactus curse is getting a
hefty grip on the land. I back North Rockhampton
against all-comers as a curse-infested spot, but the porcu-
pine vegetable is spreading all over the fertile valley of
the Fitzroy, and holding on to the ground like an
octopus. Yet 1 know several places where the pear is
cultivated (some people would cultivate the Devil) as a
substitute for a fence.
Of course, every year the various shire councils issue
circulars to landowners, ordering them to remove the
herbal beast, or it will be removed by the council at the
owners’ expense. The owners do nothing. And the
council sits back in its chair and does nothing. Only the
pear does something ; it grows.
The Government will have to Do Things or people will
shortly have to wear india-rubber pants and walk on stilts
even to buy their beer. It is a big job, but if any alleged
strong man wishes to fling his name into posterity, there
isn’t any need for him to wait till the job gets bigger—it’s
big enough.
Meanwhile, the £lO,OOO reward is withdrawn.
I am going- to form an Anti-Cactus Society, and get
myself appointed secretary at £4OO a year.
A WISE PRECAUTION.
RAFFERTY : “ No, Hogan, I will NOT foight yez. As it is, Oi know meself to be th' better
mahn, an Oi don't want to lose confidence in meself.”
Sheep King Jowett, of Longreach (Q.),
will this year shear 500,000 sheep, and as he has
just acquired some new properties, it is expected
this number will be doubled in two or three years.
As Sam McCaughey has eased off somewhat in
flock accumulation during recent years, Jowett
looks like heading the poll for Australia. During
the past few years Longreach has been adding
considerably to its flocks of woolly balls, and it
reckons it now has some claims to the honor and
dignity of being Australia’s biggest wool centre.
“Itan”: Kidston always was autocratic, but
since his trip to Fogland he is more so than ever.
Now he practically rules every Department. To
maintain his post he will be obliged this year to
do something more than shout for State Frights ;
so he intends bidding tremendously for popularity
by making himself the central buzzing figure in
the Jubilee Celebrations—the chief effort of which
will be a glorified Cow and Pumpkin Show, under
the moulting wing of the National Ass. at Bris-
bane. Kidston’s strength now lies in his capacity
to manoeuvre, and to create issues, and to invent
political kites; and he sees in this big-pumpkin
show a chance to pull various nuts out of the fire.
That eminent grass-and-bullock pioneer,
William Collins, who lately passed out, was asso-
ciated with the local beef-producing animal almost
ever since Bananaland possessed such an animal.
As early as ’63 Collins, then a young man of
helped to found Westgrove station, on the Daw-
son. In ’7B he became a partner with the late
Thomas Mcll wraith and with W. Forrest, under
the banner of the North Australian Pastoral Co.,
which acquired broad miles of country in the
Northern Territory and in Queensland. Ten
years later he was associated with Mcllwraith,
McEacharn and Co. in the despatch of the first
successful shipment of frozen beef and mutton
sent from Australia to England. And having
thus got fairly started he said that the business
was good, and he pursued the sheep and the ox all
tiie rest of his days.
Pay Day on the Mine.
(Being a cry from Cloncurry or thereabouts.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH the bottles get a rubbing,
And the shelves get dusted down ;
The counter gets a scrubbing,
And the boss forgets to frown ;
Oh the barrel in the cellar,
And the whisky and the wine
And the jug are all replenished
When it’s pay day on the mine.
The barmaid is embellished
In extra special style,
And the housemaid does her darnedest
The piano to beguile ;
The missus lets the fire out
No one has time to dine—
For the beer pump keeps ’em busy
When it’s pay day on the mine. '
In the parlor there is dancing,
And there’s fighting in the rear ;
There is skiting and romancing,
And there’s murder in the beer.
There’s a solemn Jimmy Woodser
In the corner by the door
And a bloke who’s playing patience
With the fantods on the floor.
A stranger’s in the parlor
Who is silent and aloof,
The boss makes observations
Re “ a shingle off the roof.”
And that shingle off the ceiling
Causes bitter grief and pain
Till the stranger asks the missus
If she'll “fill ’em up again.”
Then the skiters and the fighters
Take the stranger by the hand,
And solemnly assure him
He’s “the whitest in the land !”
And the barmaid, and the housemaid,
And the missus and the rest,
Confidingly assure him
That he is “ the very best.”
Then the stranger grabs the missus,
And the housemaid grabs the boss,
And they dance away like blazes
Till the housemaid goes to doss ;
Then a little more refreshment,
And the stranger goes to bed,
More in sorrow than in anger,
With a towel round his head.
When the shift boss comes in later,
With the bobby by his side,
You will see the missus cater
For their custom at the slide.
And the John Hop’s bland expression
Is a pleasant thing to see,
When the missus shoves the coin back
For “You’re having this with me ! ”
Then another and another—
And the bobby after that
Leaves the shift boss and the missus
In the parlor on their pat.
The boss is not a jealous man,
He’s white unto the bone,
And by-and-bye he knows he’ll have
The barmaid on his own.
So he elevates the deaders
And the dying to their feet,
And conducts them to the woodheap,
Or the footpath, or the street.
He clears the bar and bangs the door,
And soon there’s not a sign
Or a sound to tell a stranger
It was pay day on the mine.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP
Brisbane, January 30, 1909.
My Dear Tii a rgomindah,
Persistent report has it that Federal Chief-
Justice Griffith will shortly throw in the judicial
towel, and settle down at beautiful jVLerthyr,
where he will perhaps translate another Iliad.
There has been marrying and giving in marriage.
The only daughter of P.M. Boyce, of Townsville,
and one Mack—of your State—were using the
altar on a recent Wednesday ; and the same sun
shone down on the joining of the second Need-
ham damsel, the bud of F. H. Needham, of Can-
ning Downs, which eventuated with much ivory
satin cut plain to severity, and a wealth of Limerick
lace veil. Oh, yes ! and a bridegroom named
Beaumont Rumble. The bridesmaids were Miss
Philips (grown up) and three girleens belonging
to the Moncrieff Scotts and the Bells, all wearing
a variety of muslin confections and a heap of
bridegroom’s gifts.
A third tying of note was that of Willie Molle
(he who, in days gone by, won a champion aquatic
event for Queensland, merely by diving overboard
when his oar snapped, and lightening the ship,
a la Jonah) and the pretty daughter of bookseller
Robertson, of Toowoomba. Claude Musson, for
the sixty-ninth time, did nothing behind the
agitated groom. The guests didn’t clear off like
the ordinary variety and leave the bride
and her strange husband to escape into
the wilds. No, they saw to it that the
young couple came to no harm. They packed the
two into the mail train and brought them back to
town with them, and, by the time the metropolis
was reached, they had become so fond of them
that it was with difficulty Mr. Molle extracted his
bride from among them and got her safely into the
maternal residence at New Farm, lent for the
occasion.
“All celebrities have their peculiarities,” we
are told, and, therefore, when a genius turns up
to dine without his tie, we merely murmur that
the sacred fire is burning strongly within him, and
order up the fish. Such a case happened here
during the recent conference. A prominent
visiting professor was asked to dine and sleep at
the house of a brother in learning, and cheerfully
accepted the invitation. Aware of his absent-
mindedness, his host had some misgivings as to his
turning up. He arrived on time, however, but
quite without luggage. As a silver-tailed party
had been captured to meet him, the hostess was
somewhat agitated at his lack of evening clothes,
and being also a kindly soul, was even more
moved to pity for his scarcity of pyjamas. “Never
mind his clothes,” counselled the husband, “ they
won’t mind old W.” But the motherly heart
would not be soothed until hubby had promised
to remember to send along to the guest’s room a
suit of night attire. Behold the amazement then
of host and hostess when the noted one-arrived
in the dining room in all the bravery
of dress suit, blameless tie, handkerchief,
and collar. The evening was long and merry, but
at length the last man had gone, and the owner
turned up with the said sleeping things. As he
opened the door, with a murmured apology, and
poked in a night-shirt, there was the man of learn-
ing in his pyjamas. Then questions were asked
with great violence. “Well, you see,” replied
the wise prophet, “ I knew that I should lose the
wretched bag, so I just put on my pyjamas and
then my dinner things, and a tweed coat and
pants over them again, and it answered finely.”
And the thermometer stood at 89° !
Home-Secretary Joey Bell’s stepdaughter No.
2 is about the limit at writing stories for the
young. She has again been awarded the juvenile
prize in the Australasian this year. It makes
her fourth successful attempt, and she has only
been a trier four times.
The death of Speaker Leahy has given rise to
no end of conjecture as to the filling of the billet.
It might seriously alter the views of ex-Premier
Philp upon the retirement business. It might
provide a way out for the William person and the
Tolmie Downs push. It might with tact be turned
to account over the Young Queensland party ;
but, then, where is the tact tQ come from ? Any-
how, it will mean the healing of one sore heart at
least —that of the next Speaker.
Her Excellency arose from her couch on Mon-
day, and departed for the Toowoomba heights
once more. Mrs. Rev. Hone, who was the lady
in charge of the sick room (a cheerful blonde 6ft.
high), has returned to hubby in the wilds of
Beaudesert.
Our champion amateur piano banger (only she
wheedles rather than bullies the instrument), Elaine
Feez, returns to the Bull country, I hear, in
March to further pursue the by-paths of the key-
board. We have here another little piano pur-
suer, Florence Michaeli, who would repay with
interest a few years’ study among the music centres
of Europe, but alas ! the funds are lacking. The
great Mark Hambourg much fancied her work.
We have dealt another blow to the atom MAN.
Hitherto he has reigned supreme in the profes-
sional line of the Government service ; but Miss
Muriel Isabel Gregory, offspring of the recent
Government Printer, has now wrecked his pres-
tige by getting herself appointed a draftsman
in the Survey Qffice. Six months ago she went
up for an exam, with about 20 males, and the
males don’t know yet what struck them.
The president of the National Council of Women
has been in gaol. That is, she has been having a
look round, just in case, you know, and has found
that King Edward’s boarding establishment isn’t
such a bad crib after all. Personally I always
rather envy the appointments. There are no
marble baths where I doss, and the clocks don’t
keep anything like good time. However, there
are compensations. The hours of rising and retir-
ing are absurd at Boggo-road, and if I were a
boarder I should take out all my spare time
writing letters to the papers about it, and about
the unbecoming ideas that prevail there on the
matter of dress.
A new discovery is to the effect that our Gover-
nor has a German streak in him. In the very
remote ages it seems that a certain German pastor
had a difference of a doctrinal nature with
the Fatherland, and in consequence he shook the
sausages from his beard and crossed the Channel
to England. His name at that period was
something like Schlessingbacherbockstein, but
the British folk couldn’t get their teeth into
that. Somehow they called him Thessinge,
which later toned down to Thesiger, and there
you are. This probably accounts for the mid-
summer madness that led our Governor over the
water to take part m the Anniversary celebra-
tions to the glory of William the Sudden at the
Turn Yerein on Wednesday evening. Another
guest of the occasion was the Kidstocrat. He
didn’t seem to enjoy himself somehow.
They have had to get a special padlock made
for the big State motor in which the only Kidsto-
erat takes his daily airings. You see, it is stabled
in a convenient spot near the main entrance to the
Executive buildings, and every blessed man that
wandered there used to open the door, seat him-
self inside, pull out the travelling desk, open the
cupboard (where the whisky ought to be), and
telephone to the absent driver. In short, he used
to behave for one grand moment like the King of
Queensland. But this encouraged ambition that
was apt to become unhealthy, besides which it
wore out the car, so now the vehicle is strictly
tied up.
As I write a murmur reaches me to the effect
that the Kidston family is daily wandering round
in the car looking at desirable villa residences in
New Farm. This all comes of taking to the Mary
Ann habit, which leads to high-priced abodes and
society. Apropos , William and his wife are run-
ning an At Home on the Lucinda on Saturday.
(Guests must be prepared to shake hands with
all and sundry, including the Scotch tyke, before
venturing on board.)
There is sorrow among the Pioneer Clubbers in
this sad city. Miss Edith Dickson, by whose
efforts the cat concern has been kept going, has
announced her intention of removing her small
person England wards, and there is grave fear that
without her warmth of enthusiasm the frost may
become overwhelming. Wanted —oh! so badly—
a secretary with tact, and a few really interested
members.
Col. Foxton, Federal M.P. for Brisbane, is
going into the Pooh Bah business. Not alone is he
called upon to uphold his Parliamentary dignity,
but they have elected him president of the Cricket
Board of Control, and acting Military Comman-
dant during the furlough of the Lyster family.
He will thus be forced to be continually changing
his cricket togs for a court dress, only to jump out
cf that into his puttees and helmet of military
splendor. Meanwhile the Lysters wander in the
shadow of the Pyramids.
There was consternation on Thursday when it
leaked out that a real live Earl on board the
Manuka from ’Frisco had been in the bay, and
had escaped without one of our girls setting an
eye upon him. This is the second time we have
been done brown in the Earl line, the first escapee
being the Gov.-General.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Owing to the comparatively high values of
pastoral properties, Kidston’s finances will get a
good lift from the estates of Speaker John Leahy
and William Collins, of Nindooimbah. Both
estates will pay fat death duties; Collins’ will
probably be the fattest since Tyson’s £60,000
made a futile attempt to prevent a Philp deficit.
Collins and his brother, R.M., owned or controlled
a million or two acres in Northern, Central and
Southern Queensland, including much freehold in
the well-watered South-East. A drought never
at any time extends throughout the whole of
Queensland, hence they accumulated wealth un-
interruptedly. J ohn Leahy was manager of a big
squatting concern, and the political agent and
organiser of the squattocracy. He and Philp
were jointly interested in pastoral property ; in
fact, it was to Leahy that Philp owed a good deal
of his second big financial lift.
“ The Australian Infant is the best possible
Immigrant for Australia ” has now passed into a truism.
But, unfortunately, through lack of proper training, the
average mother doesn’t know how to treat her first infant
when he arrives. In the Commonwealth and Maoriland,
during the 22 years from 1884 Co 1905 inclusive, no less
than 341,578 infants (42 daily) have died. Of these deaths
probably 170,000 could have been prevented. The pioneer
baby of a family has a hard row to hoe. He is the victim
of his mother’s ignorance, and by the mistakes she makes
with him she learns how to bring up his future brothers
and sisters. Much has been said about the iniquity of
the elder child getting the bulk of the property', but he
has earned it and paid for it too. Consider how he has
to suffer for the benefit of the younger ones. Every
woman should be instructed in the rearing of babies, but
till this desirable state of affairs comes about, the best
thing the intending mother can do is to read up the sub-
ject ; and there is no better work than “ The Feeding
and Management of Australian Infants in Health ami
Disease,” by Dr. P. E. Muskett, now running through its
seventh edition, and sold from The Bulletin Office in con-
junction with “The Australian Medical Guide” and
“ Thq of Health,” for £3 post free.*


CLASSES WHO SHOULD COME
TO QUEENSLAND.
Farmers.
Agricultural Laborers.
Men accustomed to Live Stock.
Miners.
Domestic Servants.
Men, with small capital, accustomed to out-
door life.
Men, without capital, not afraid of hard work.
Young men, without experience, who are willing
to take employment whilst they learn the
methods of work in Queensland.
Any steady energetic individual from the above
classes should have no difficulty in earning a good
livelihood and in making a comfortable home in
Queensland.

MORE ABOUT CLIMATE.
By J. D. FITZGERALD.
Take, for example, the Darling Downs district
of Southern Queensland—“ the garden of Aus-
tralia,” as it has been well called. Here, where
the land space is not yet exhausted, where there

is still ample room for the small farmer, and for the
agricultural laborer (especially for him, with the
chance of his developing, after experience
acquired, into a thrifty small farmer him-
self) —here is a great tableland 2000 ft. above
sea-level, swept always by the breezes from the
north, south, east, and west, monsoonal and trade.
On this tableland the welcome settler will have
the finest climate in the world. It has been com-
pared to the Riviera, but it is the Riviera climate
without Black Auster and the Mediterranean
hot winds, sea-borne from North Africa.
Climate is proved by the products of the soil. All
the fruits, flowers, vegetables, and cereals of the
semi-tropical and temperate zones flourish exceed-
ingly on this vast, black-and-chocolate-soiled
plateau. The mean annual temperature on this
glorious spot is 61 degrees ; and the nights are in-
variably cool. Upon the rolling downs, undulat-
ing hills, and timbered ridges rare frosts may
occur in winter, but snow has only been seen there
twice within the memory of the oldest settler, and
snow in Australia is an affair of 24 hours, not of
months, as in Canada or Great Britain. These
downs are Devonshire without the snow, Kent
BRUNTON STEPHENS.
with perpetual sunshine, Italy without its July
heat.
And these are but a sample of the tablelands of
Queensland. Central Queensland’s climate has
been rightly described as “genial and health-
giving.” Of the latter quality the present writer
can give direct testimony from personal experi-
ence as already described” West of Rockhampton
there are the same characteristics, perhaps a
little accentuated, as were found in the Darling
Downs. On the tablelands, and even in the
coastal districts, you will find the fruit of tem-
perate zones side by side in the same garden with
those of the tropics—the pear, the peach, the
cherry, plum and apricot, even the strawberry—
alongside the paw-paw, the granadilla, the guava,
mango, the cocoanut and the custard apple.
What other climate in the world can stand that
test? I must quote one writer on the subject of
climate from the practical point of view: “To
the farming settler, especially, this question of
climate is a very important one. In other
countries, with more temperate climates and sub-
COASTAL SCENERY.—A SURF BATHERS' PARADISE.
ject to frost and snow in winter, there are many
disadvantages in connection with farming opera-
tions. In Queensland, cattle require little or no
protection in the winter season, and the land is
accessible for grazing and cultivation all the year
round, instead of being, as in some countries,
covered with snow and ice during several months
of the year.”
In Northern Queensland the tropical heat has
its advantages. It secures a steady and adequate
rainfall—a regular rainy season—and thus makes
Queensland less subject to droughts than some of
the Southern States. The general characteristics
of the climate throughout are (1) an even tem-
perature on the coast, without a very great
variation throughout the year ; (2) the climate of
the tablelands, with a wider range of temperature

FOR YEARS IN QUEENSLAND.
(Her memoirs are now running through THE LONE HAND.)
between summer heat and winter cold ; (3) the
western climate, with greater extremes of both
heat and cold, but with a siccity and a sparkling
clearness in the air which make for physical
energy in the individual, contrasting in the minds
of those who have experienced it with the lassi-
tude produced by the climates of the countries of
Southern Europe, which are described conven-
tionally as “Sunny Italy ” and “ Sunny Spain.”
And again, it must be remembered, in considering
the important question of climate, that, with a
plenteous rainfall, the fine days average about 255
in the year.
Again, it must be recognised that, after all, the
death-rate is the best test of salubrity of climate.
And the average death-rate of Queensland is
possibly the lowest in the world—certainly the
lowest of all the Australasian States —a death-rate
of but 9'56 per 1000 of the population ; and the ex-
pectation of child-life is vastly greater than in any
other country in the world. As is generally
known, the crucial period in the life of the indi-
vidual is during the first year of life. The wisest
efforts of the municipal statesmen and the hygienic
experts of Europe are exercised in the task of
grappling with the problem of preserving the
child during the first year. Depdts are provided
in large towns to supply free milk, pasteurised or
“humanised,” for the' use of the infants whose
mothers, victims of slum conditions, perhaps, are
unable to feed them from the breast. Nurses are
employed by the great municipalities to teach the
mothers the difficult art of mothering their own
children. Prizes are given to those mothers who
have safely brought their babies through the
perils of the first year of life. What a tribute,
then, to the climate of Queensland that in her
genial climate the child is immune from most of
the ills of this perilous first year ! For this is the
case. The death rate for the first year of infant
life in Queensland is very low.
A few comparisons will be instructive. The
infantile death-rate of Maoriland is the lowest
in the world, 68 per 1000. N.B.W. comes next
with 74’53 per 1000 in 1906, and Queensland was
at 74'68 in that year. England and Wales lost 128
per 1000 in 1905, France 144, Japan 151, and
Switzerland 129 per 1000. For the Common-
wealth, and taking the first year of infant life,
Queensland’s was by far the lowest death-rate,
being 1'94 per 1000, while N.S.W. was 2'04, Vic-
toria, 2'53; S.A., 2'02; W.A., 3 08 ; and Tas-
mania, 2'57. There could hardly be a better test
of the stamina of parent and child in the new
Queensland nation, nor a truer indication of the
virility which the climatic conditions of Queens-
land conduce to. This alone is an answer to those
who say that the benignant tropical climate of the
Northern State is not a “white man’s country.”
It is not only a white man’s, but is fit for virile
white women and sturdy white children.
Let us turn again to the people themselves as a
test of climatic influences. You may search the
world and not find a more stalwart people than
the native-born. As to the immigrants, we are
not responsible for their physique; that was pre-
determined before they reached our shores. We
may be sure that as only the most enterprising
would join the ranks of immigrants who come
across an immense stretch of sea, and endure
many hardships (now fortunately minimised by
splendid ships and governmental care and
thoughtfulness) to become Queenslanders, the
Northern State has secured the very creme de la
creme of the Old World races. Collateral evidence
of this, too, is available in two things—(l) the ripe
old ages to which the emigrants live; and (2) the
tall, wiry, and strong offspring —bold and inde-
pendent in their way of meeting the problems of
life ; democratic and free spoken in their politi-
cal views ; capable in dealing with the natural
conditions, and in conquering the difficulties
which confront the pioneer, even though he may
be “ native here and to the manner born.” The
longevity of the transplanted races is, surely, one
of the best signs which can betoken the salubrity
of the Queensland climate. The average shearer,
as a class, sons of yeoman farmers, well mounted,
splendid riders, would compare with the finest
English yeomen, the German Junckers, or the
members of the Roman Equestrian Order.
This Queensland race bids fair to develop cer-
tain special characteristics which will differen-
tiate it from other Australians. Fine athletes,
cricketers, footballers, oarsmen, expert bushmen,
adventurers in the best sense of the word, they
take their evolution into a distinct type from
their climatic environment. They are an outdoor
race, and therefore not subject to “ house ” dis-
eases. They exploited beach bathing long before
Southern Australians devoted themselves to it
with such passionate ardor. The signs of outdoor
life are upon them in their bronzed faces and lean
and wiry forms. And the women areevolvinga type
which is not unlike Spanish beauty—dark-haired,
passionate, home-loving, fond of freedom, bold in
their political opinions, recording their votes at
elections, and thus asserting their equality with
man ; but withal modest and faithful—good wives
and model mothers, not yet bitten by the craze
for dress and theatres and high living which ob-
sesses some of their Southern and their European
sisters. Those of the bush are daring horsewomen,
resourceful housewives, without whose loving aid
pioneering in Queensland would not have been
possible, and whose share in the wealth-producing
capacity of the nation cannot be over-estimated.
And with all this they are musical and artistic.
I*n art and literature the Queensland women are
known in the world. Nellie Melba took no harm
to her glorious voice from the years she lived in
the Mackay-Bowen district. Rather may we
assume that it needed only this touch of the
Queensland sun, which her residence gave her, to
instil that golden warmth into the vocal
liquescence of that lovely organ—a warmth that
has melted the hearts of millions of art-loving
people throughout the world. Then there was
that other of whom Roderic Quinn sang, the
girlish rival of Melba in her Queensland days,
who gave up the prospects of entrancing the great
world with glorious song, and having kings and

queens at her feet, who surrendered a great
musical career for the noble duties of wife and
mother—she was a product of the climate of
Queensland. And last, but not least, so far
as singers are concerned, the brilliant Florence
Schmidt (now Mrs. Derwent Wood), who con-
quered the difficult musical world of Europe with
one of the most glorious voices ever found in a
human throat. She came from Rockhampton—
a river town in which the climate is alleged by
those who have never lived there to be intolerable,
but which those who have sojourned there for a
year and have enjoyed the alternations of the
seasons, from the gloriously mild winter to the
tropical heat of summer, will defend before all
men. Florence Schmidt is a testimonial to the
health-giving qualities of Central Queensland’s
climate. For the air which nourished that beauti-
ful soprano voice must have something fragrant
and ambrosial in it.
Nor is the climate inconsistent with success in
literature. For in Queensland dwelt Mrs. Camp-
bell Praed, a novelist of note in London ; William
Archer, foremost of London’s dramatic and
literary critics (who, if I am not mistaken, belongs
to the Gracemere Archers, of Rockhampton); J.
Brunton Stephens, whose “ Convict Once ” and
lighter verses can be counted among the corner
stones of the great Australian literary temple
“P. LUFTIG" (PETER AIREY).
Photo, by Poulsen, Brisbane.
that is to be ; and Essex Evans, Francis Kenna,
and “P. Luftig” (Peter Airey), whose work is
known throughout Australia.
And if the would-be immigrant has not yet
fully divested himself of his prejudices with regard
to the climate, we may point to its benign
seductiveness in the winter season, when the
Tasmanian, Victorian, New South Welshman
and Maorilander, in company with the tourist
who has heard of its mild benignity in far-off
lands, go on the winter tour to Cairns or Thurs-
day Island in one of the splendid liners, coastal
and deep sea, which run that route in a lake-like
sea, with smooth water, shielded from the rough
waves of the Pacific by the coral buckler of the
Great Barrier Reef. Of this the reader will be
told later on. For the present, this much need
only be said, that those who have doubts of the
salubrity and the tolerableness of the Queens-
land climate, from Moreton to Thursday Island,
and from Rockhampton to Barcaldine, are not
those who have lived there. Such a criticism of
Queensland is a criticism founded on ignorance.

them near it. I am thankful I am
cured and to anyone else I know of

soon tell what to get. lam sure that
Cuticura is a wonderful treatment.

DIGESTION
What are aching heads, trembling
hands, lost confidence, depression and
sleeplessness, but symptoms of wrecked
I digestion ? How can you have good
health, steady nerves, strength and
freedom from pain, if Indigestion is
poisoning and starving your body ?
The very first step to recovery is
Mother Seigel’s Syrup, a remedy which
will make your stomach do its work.
By ensuring proper digestion, your
blood supply will be purified and en-
riched, and you will again enjoy the
vigour and buoyancy of robust health.
Miss Ida Turner, 64, Baptist Street, Redfern,
N.S.W., writes on July, 15th, 1908: “ From
childhood I was delicate, being always sus-
ceptible to chills and indigestion. As I grew into
womanhood my health did not improve, indi-
gestion remaining my chief trouble. After many
medicines and tonics had failed to relieve me,
Mother Seigel’s Syrup restored me to splendid
health —in fact, it made a new girl of me.”

“Westerner”: The absorption of the Perth Morning
Herald by the Daily News marks the passing of Stirling
Bros., one of the oldest newspaper firms in Australia.
Edward Stirling, the founder of the firm, issued the first
newspaper in the West in May, 1832, in the form of a
weekly manuscript journal, price 3s. 6d. per copy. The
first printed paper, the Perth Gazette, was issued the
following year (January, 1833) at 3s. per copy. This was
the forerunner of the present-day West Australian,
which thus ranks second to the Sydney Morning Herald
in seniority among existing Australian newspapers—Mr.
“ James’ ” paper being first issued (as the Sydney
Herald) in April, 1831. Stirling went out of the
newspaper business with the launching of the
Gazette, but returned in 1840 to found a
rival weekly, the Inquirer, which he conducted for
50 years. He handed it over to his four sons (John,
Frederick,’ Horace and Lewis Stirling) in 1890. The Daily
News, an evening offshoot, was issued in 1881, the In-
quirer remaining a weekly. The Morning Herald was
launched by the same firm in 1896, Arthur Lovekin (now
proprietor, editor, manager and general Pooh Bah of the
Daily News) being first editor. W. F. Forster, who suc-
ceeded Lovekin in 1900, made a scoop by the alleged
discovery of the original of Boldrewood’s “ Captain Star-
light ” in the person of an old W.A. identity; and for a
term the paper boomed. Shortly after Forster trekked
East to find wider scope for his talents, and took a posi-
tion on the Age. A meteoric succession of editors fol-
lowed, until finally Jack Drayton, an old-time comrade
of “ Smiler ” Hales on the g-oldfields press, took charge
and ran the paper until its demise last week. Bishop Gibney
bought a controlling interest in the Herald a couple of
years ago, and practically conducted it from the R.O.
“ Bishop’s Palace.” The good Bishop made an attempt
to run the paper on reform lines, excluding all sporting
and betting news and advertisements ; but the circula-
tion went down with such a thump that the “ reforms ”
were hastily dropped. The Herald has always been run
in the Liberal interest, and its suspension leaves Perth
with a very poor choice between the stodgy West Aus-
tralian and the sensational, not to say shrieking, Daily
News.
• * * *
Died, the other day, aged 80 and a good bit, William
Hay, who had the job of buying and setting up the first
machinery for the Adelaide Advertiser ; and the Adver-
tiser was aged 50 last year. Hay was overseer when the
paper started, and had been in and out of the office a good
deal since then.
RUBAIYAT OF THE ROUNDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Awake! The noonday Sun has looped the loop ;
The Rounds await you—you must fly the coop !
The rival Journal, briefly scanned, has turned
Your heart to water with a column Scoop.
Though you have Space, yet cut your breakfast short,
’Tis time for picking up the City Court ;
For if unto the evening Rag you trust,
Twill ditch you with an Incomplete Report.
‘All dhrunks to-day,” the Watch-house Keeper saitli —
“ But stay, there’s wan good Case ” —you hold your
breath,
And pray to God that they have taken deps.—
“ Charge iv Assault—Young Woman Kicked to Death.”
Tis worth a good Half-Column, and you guess
You’ll get the details from the C.P.S. ;
But he has gone, and probably the Sub
Will say, “A Quarter —neither More nor Less.”
Your Luck stands good—the Plainclothes Man who gave
The Evidence is mighty still to save.
You take a Note ; then hey, the merry Morgue,
That half-way Hostel to the Pauper’s Grave !
Behold, an Inquest on. a Female Child 1.
“ Improper Feeding’’—hear the Nurse reviled !
It’s worth a Crosshead, but you’re pushed for time.
Why need the Coroner become so wild ?
For lack of Space, though Life was crowded out,
’Tis nothing new to make a Fuss about,
Respectability to scandalise,
Or staid Conventionality to flout.
There’s little else to cause you to abide—
“ Natural Causes ” and a Suicide ;
You wave the Orderly a fond farewell,
And swiftly to the City Hall you glide.
“Tar-Paving”— that’s a par., which having writ,
Upon the theme of “Dust” you spend your wit;
Behold herein your Day’s epitome—
To-morrow shall disperse each Word of it!
And now the City Clerk would fain forget
The long-deferred Report whereon you’re s.et;
You ask the same old Question once again—
“lt will be Soon,” he murmurs, “ but not Yet.”
Then to the Hospital at half-past three
You tramp in search of Death and Casualty—
The Swallowed Fishbone and the Fatal Fall,
The Draught of Match-heads and the Fractured Knee.
A moment’s halt —and then you make toward
The C.I. Branch, and there ring round the Board ;
You’re lucky if there’s “ Nothing for the Press”
And not a single Item to record.
Then “ Home, Sweet Home ” —but first your steps are
lured
To Eastern Hill, wherefrom may be secured
A Par about the Fire that swept away
Two Dwellings, Brick, One Storey, Uninsured.
’Tis Night; once more to Town your feet are bound,
To glean such News as haply may be found ;
Perchance a grim and gory Murder waits—
Perchance a Burglary : Ring Round, Ring Round !
Full to the Brim with Copy you return,
Wad upon Wad, for which the Printers yearn ;
When lo I “A Fire ! A Fire in Flinders Lane ! ”
“O H 1! ” you bellow, “ let the D d Thing Burn ! ”
But such a Bluff you know is all in vain ;
You’re there among the sparks that roar and rain ;
And when, all singed and drenched, you’re back at
Work,
The news comes in, “ It’s broken out again ! ”
Right here the Sub remarks, with eager Joy,
“ They’ve got a Murder out at North Fitzroy ” ;
Whereon the Shipping Man rings in to say,
“A Yacht’s capsized near No. 7 Buoy.”
The list of trains to Williamstown you scan,
Feeling as if your Brain were made of Bran ;
When tardily the Chief of Staff observes,
“ Perhaps you’d better take an Extra Man.”
Then, when at last your dripping Brow you wipe
(Your Murder Story on the Linotype),
The capsized Yacht’s collided with the Sub.,
Who yells, “ What made you write this blanky Tripe ? ”
A Hair perhaps divides the False and True—
And if you faked, what else were you to do'?
’Tis naught—the Sub. subsides—you thank your Stars,
Because the Sub. has been a Roundsman, too.
He knows it All—the Pitfall and the Gin
Waiting the Bluff that cannot always win ;
The Rope’s around his Neck as much as yours—
Pray then that he will let no Libel in 1
Forme after Forme is locked—each Proof is read ;
The Paper goes to Press—the Last Word’s said :
Three-seven-six is dumb ; ’tis Two a.m. ;
Let’s ring up one-ought-one, and get to Bed.

THIS Company is nov formed with the object of acquiring from William Goodall
Hearne, Chemist, Geelong, the RIGHT OF SALE of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,
Frootoids, and other of Hearne’s Medicines for Australia, and deriving all the
profits between the manufacturing price and the selling price of them ; and for
carrying on and extending the businesses as specified in the Memorandum of Association.
The purchase price of this Right of Sale for Australia of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure,
Frootoids, and certain other of Hearne’s Medicines, which said Right of Sale will be
acquired as on and from the Ist day of February, 1909, by agreement dated the loth day
of December, 1908, is £12,500, to be satisfied by the issue to the said William Goodall
Hearne of Shares in the Company to the value of one-fifth part on the formation of the
Company and one-fifth part at the commencement of each of the four following years.
This agreement made between the said W. G. Hearne of the one part and W. G. Hearne
and Company Limited of the other part, or a copy thereof, can be inspected at the Regis-
tered Office of the Company, 127 Ryrie Street, Geelong, any day before the closing of the
subscription list, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon.
The Company being based on Co-operative Principles opens the door for splendid
possibilities, inasmuch as the Reputation achieved by these medicines is simply
Magnificent ; and the greater the increase in the sales of them, the larger will be the
Company’s profit available for Shareholders.
During the first five years, the said William Goodall Hearne guarantees payment of
the dividends to the Shareholders. As one evidence of the value of this guarantee, the
“fixed deposits ” (cash) at the guarantor’s credit in the various Banks of Issue named in
this prospectus amounts to £23,000.
The sales of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure alone during the last three years amount to over
£89,000. The Profits of the business are considerably more than ample to provide for the
Dividends, and although only a nominal £lO per cent, per annum Dividend is guaranteed
on the Ordinary Shares, this should be immensely increased by the co-operation of those
who sell these medicines, and who now have the opportunity of becoming Shareholders and
participating in the Profits, because as a result of this co-operation a large proportion of
what is being spent in advertising can be saved and added to the Dividends.
Wide powers of operation and extension are secured by the Company in its Memorandum
of Association, so that the Business may be extended as shall be deemed advantageous.
This issue of Shares is limited to purchasers of Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure or any other of
the catalogue list of Hearne’s Medicines, and is intended to provide an opportunity of shar-
ing in the management, profits and benefits of further extension of business.
The preliminary expenses connected with the formation of the Company will be paid by
the said William Goodall Hearne.
The whole amount provided by this issue of Shares will be retained in the business of
the Company and devoted to its business purposes.
No Director will receive any remuneration for his services as such, but any Director
acting in the capacity of Manager, or otherwise employed on behalf of the Company, may
receive for services rendered in such capacity fair remuneration as may be decided on by
the Directors of the Company for the time being.
This issue has not been underwritten, and no commission or promotion money has been
paid, or is payable for subscriptions on Shares. /'
The minimum of subscriptions for Shares upon which the Directors will proceed to allot-
ment is 12,000.
Applications for Shares will proceed only on one of the forms of application referred
to below.
For the purposes of the Companies Act of Victoria, 1896, this advertisement does not
fully comply with the requirements of Section 104, and the public are referred to the full
prospectus, copies of which, with forms of application may be obtained at the registered
office of the Company, 127 Ryrie Street, Geelong, Victoria.
“ N.” writes :
M'Clurk’s, just to hand, has the story of the Vander-
bilts. The founder, the Commodore, was a fairly satis-
factory millionaire, if such a thing is possible, infinitely
more so than grasping, selfish, cruel Carnegie, who took
a fit and unloaded. Commodore Vanderbilt, when young,
pursued a business something like that of Melbourne’s
Pat Hanna, who worked a punting boat at Queen’s
Wharf, got rich, lived ; n a mansion, and became M.L.A.
While P. Hanna was“curiously out of tune at speech-
making, Commodore Vanderbilt was a distinctly valuable
public man, though self-centred. It is hardly credible
nowadays that it was once necessary to travel over seven
separate and disjointed railroads to get from New
York to Chicago, and drag baggage from one train to
another at every change. Vanderbilt created the through
service. To the end of his life the Commodore could
hardly spell a sentence correctly. He seems to have read
nothing but the Bible and the “ Pilgrim’s Progress.” His
ambition was to mop up the country for his own family.
His son William doubled the millions. Then they began
to fade away in branches of the family. The Vanderbilts
have sunk in the Capua of ease. There is no one of the
name in the first line.
“Where’s the Impertinent Clara lying?" he yelled at
the knot of wharf laborers outside the shed.
“She ain’t lying,” retorted a small man. “She’s
gorne.”
“Gone! She can’t be gone ! ”
“ But I tell yer she is ! She’s just pulled out from ther
wharf.”
“ Well, why th’blazes didn’t you say so before! Can’t
I get a boat to take me off ?”
“Yes; there’s a cove down there as will put yer on
board.” 1
The man with the yelling baby danced on the roadway,
“ Take me to him ! Show me the way, can’t you ! ”
The lumper detached himself from the group, and the
pair of them stumbled together to the water’s edge
where they shouted, a mad trio, with a gruff waterman,
while the baby howled a solo at the masthead lights of
-" ,ld "’ s *"* —* th “
M *l, . , , a , „„
The man with the baby instantly turned and fled up
the hill, closely pursued by the small laborer and the
cheers of the group by the shed. An opportune hansom,
returning- to the rank, came round the corner, and a
g*reat howl of welcome, led by the baby, went up to the
wondering stars. The hansom stopped, the three of them
fell in, and the conveyance disappeared over the hill in a
cloud of dust and yells. I hurried down to the tram, and
just managed to catch the Mosman boat. The Imperti-
nent Clara—a mass of lights—came gliding down past
Miison’s Point as our boat swept round the corner of the
P. &O. wharf. Out in the centre of the stream a lantern
leaped up and down and yelled with rage. At least, that
is what it seemed like ; in reality it was a boatman in a
skiff signalling that he had a man and a bundle of howls
to put on board. Abell rang faintly inside the steamer,
and she bore down like a moving mountain on the tiny
boat.
“ AHOY-Y-Y ' san " Vf. b , oa V' an ; H hrido-e and
In reply there was a muffled shout Lora the bridge, and
the engine-room telegraph clanged
The big ship came at the skiff like an avenging shadow.
< T3 , the ecu o, ,„c
steamer united with it in a dreadful duet.
A father’s curse rose up in the darkness,

YOU BRUTE ! OH, YOU BRUIE
That was all I heard. The captain of the ferry-boat
fused to stop so that I could listen to the rest oi it.
“ Kodak ” tells a story of the sea and an
infuriated baby :
It was 7 o’clock of a still summer night. The shore bell
rang sharply, and the passengers’ friends and relations
climbed ashore and stood in a group on the wharf where
the great port side-light, like a very bleary eye, glared
vinously at a pile of empty casks. “Any more for the
shore? ” cried a seaman. A man wrung the hand of hi 3
friend and hurried off just as a voice from the bridge
ordered the gangway to be taken in. There was a rattle
of iron and wood, a confused babel of last words, and
then the clear ring of the engine-room telegraph. The
steamer commenced to back out like a lady from the
presence of royalty, and two pages in moleskins, bearing
between them the loop of the rope train by which she was
to swing, walked carefully along the edge of the wharf.
The jumble of friends and relations walking behind them
and waving handkerchiefs made a good enough imitation
of a patriotic crowd. I waited till the vessel had
turned and was moving slowly ahead, and then I lit out
for home. As I reached the roadway an enraged man,
carrying an infuriated baby, rushed madly down Mar-
garet-street.

The trials of William King, Melbourne’s
specially ferocious negro burglar and brutal
assault expert, are humorous. King is doing what
is practically a life sentence ; that is to say he is a
nigger fury who is getting on in years, and he has
a very long sentence to serve, and after that he is
to serve an indeterminate sentence which will last
until he reforms, and as he has no idea of reform-
ing he is really in for life. William, who is a
huge mass of ink, batters warders almost to death
at times, and on account of the usual amusement
he was lately committed for trial. In such a case
the Law seems to have two alternatives—either to
gi ve William a long sentence to run concurrently
with his present one, or to give him a long sen-
tence which will start when his present (practi-
cally) life sentence is finished. Either way the
Law doesn’t seem likely to get much change out
of William the Murky—and he may burst out of
the dock and assault the Judge.

“ Harrison 0 his New Year narrative :
Walter and Dick and I always made it our business to
pet drunk on New Year’s Eve. Walter said that it was a
duty we owed to the community, and Dick and I signified
consent by admiring silence. It was 190 S that we started
our spree, and 1909 when we brought it to a regretful
conclusion. It was somewhere in between that we met
Jenkins. Jenkins was a married man, and should have
known better, but we allowed him to join us, because he
was a generous old boy who insisted upon paying for
every drink. We got rid of a good deal of moisture one
way and another. We started on beer —it was very nice
bber, good,, wet.stuff ; then Walter suggested creme de
mfenthe, which we accordingly sampled, solely out of
deference to his wishes ; besides it seemed a waste not to
take it when Jenkins..was paying for it. After creme de
menthe we tried several other forms of dampness, so as
not to offend old Jenkins, who had suggested them.
When closing time came Walter objected to leaving the
premises, but the retailer of demented and whirlingliquors
insisted. Jenkins ranged himself with Walter, andpleaded
piteously : ‘‘ A beer, mish’er ; jush one, f’r Gor’s shake—
hie—it—it’sh f’r me wifesh—shesh’s ill.” The dispenser
of bottled humidity remained quite unmoved by this
touching appeal, and we had to leave. Jenkins sobbed
heart-brokenly; great tears dozed from his eyes and
chased each other, down his cheeks until they at last
found refuge in his bushy white whiskers. Dick and I
left with some dignity. Not so Walter; he Was thrown
out and landed on his ear because he called the moisture
manufacturer “a callous Bacchanalian monstrosity.”
Then at Jenkins’ suggestion we went and had some cray-
fish. It was really delectable crayfish 4 eating i t was like
devouring a sonnet by Keats. It was not until we were
outside the fish emporium, and I was about to hail a cab,
t hat Jenkins suddenly discovered that he had forgotten
where he lived. He’ had a vague idea that it was in
“jSou’ Yarrish.” We were walking the streets of that
eminently respectable suburb in the first hours of
the New Year, searching for Jenkins’ elusive residence. <
We knocked up about a dozen wrong people. A.t about
the fifteenth house we knocked at, what looked like a
ghost with its hair in curl-papers, appeared at the
window: “ Ish thash you, Alish, m’ dearsh?” inquired
old Jenkins sweetly. “You beast! Oh, you BRUTE ! ”
hissed the ghost. “ Misht’r Jenkins hash jus’ be’n ’avin’
a—hie—beg pard’n—crayfish supper with us,” I explained
valiantly. “Mr. JENKINS! Isn’t that you, Albert?”
I KneW it was not because his name is Henry. The ghost
melted away, and the window closed with a bang. It
was well on in the New Year when we knocked at the
door of the twentieth'house. For a while there was no
reply—then it came. Jenkins was singing tenderly ;he
was as far as '
Zo-zo^-biC —Margot, Clo-clo,
Frou-frou— : ■
when a hair-brush struck him in the solar plexus, and a
cake of soap came'im eon tact with his pate. We also
made the acquaintance of various similar articles. For
myself I was content with a boot. Jenkins sat on the
footpath where he had fallen: “Than’ yo’ vere mush,
gen’men, f’r seein’ me ’ome, butsh” (beaming happily)
“ ’sail ri’t now. This ish th’ plashe, gen’men—hie ! ”
“Sr.” : Remarked “ Gilrooney’a ” satire
on the Melbourne trams as compared to the Syd-
ney rushers. I once noted a drunk on board the
dummy of a Carlton tram. He said he was from
Sydney on asb.nst, , Approaching a turn, in the;
line, the gripman sung out: “Hold fast going
round the curve.” Then the conductor yelled,
“Mind the turn, please.” Around in the car
where the drunk stood were notices warning the
passerigeps of theganger of tbemurve. The drunk
hung;on to the iron standard of the car tenaciously.
He ’exhorted , his fellow passengers to be “very
carefullsh,” The tram Slowly swung round a bend
and stopped. The conductor got out and pushed
the tram along. The drunk hung on to the iron
standard. After a while he awesomely asked,
“Are we coming to the curve?”. The gripman
replied that he had passed it long ago. Then the
drunk fell off in a faint through nervous exhaustion

THE WEIGHT QUESTION.
In the weight of a bicycle there exists a point where safety is assured. Every ounce beyond
that point is superfluous and means wasted energy. Every ounce of that superfluous weight cut off
means increased ease of propulsion. In a Bicycle built of
GENUINE B.S.A. FITTINGS
the point of safety is assured not by a clumsy addition of weight, but by the use of the
tinest material the world produces, by the knowledge of the most expert designers, and
by the most scientific methods of manufacture known to-day.
Thus are secured the three essentials—Strength, Lightness, Speed. The fourth essen-
i ia y important is Suitability, and this can be secured by having your new bicyde
built to your order to suit yourself.

Of You and July.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF you had passed me by
One jewelled night of July,
When the jasmine, to halo your dazzling
head,
Trailed down from the balcony garlanded ;
When my acolyte sense, at thfe calling of you,
Drew in to the shining, swift thralling of you ;
Then, shamed (it may be) to self-scorning therefor,
In a half-willed revolting all haltingly wrought—
Self-gyved with its dear unforgettable pain—
Yet smiling, sank back to its thraldom again ;
If my pulse had not stilled in the nearness that
brought
(Through the rubbing of feet on the rustling floor)
My soul to run down like a palmful of sand,
To lie with my life in the cup of your hand—
Ah, if you had passed me by,
Nor forged me this shining thrall,
Nor sung me this strange, new madrigal
That harps in my blood, should I know what I
Had lost, that night of July?
I do not wonder, I
(Since one throned night of July)
That, vibrantly-strung, in your Presence’s span,
Thrill my days, who was erst but a masterless
man !
Or that drinking the exquisite fineness of you,
The flawless, compelling divineness of you,
You prisoned my sense with one curve of your
arm,
Drew my glad soul to be drowned in your eyes,
Checked my mad heart to lie palpitant there
With the loose veiling mesh of your luminous
hair ;
Yet alway this understream deepening plies
Down these veins running rich with the wine of
your charm—
“ Think deeper, love less ! For it may be in this
Perchance, that the truest of tenderness is.”
Yet what (if you passed me by
To-day) should I covet or choose
For this sweet, glad sorrow I would not lose,
This dear half-dying, that else had I
Foregone that night of July?
Queenliness, I would try—
Since one rare night of July—
Schooling each sense, so to fathom and know
What your Whiteness doth will me—to shapen
me so
That the very intangible sweetness of you,
The virginal, splendid completeness of you
Should rein the fierce blood that my heart riots
through,
Not to strive, but serve mute; since I would not
to plead
With my knees in the dust, and the trite lovers’
tale
Grows outworn (God’s pity) and tawdrily stale ;
Still hearken! The truest man hath not such
need
To love as be loved ; yet You always are You,
And lam but I; so I would not to kiss
But your steps, so I be where your perfectness is.
Yet, if you had passed me by,
Had my drab soul, otherwise,
Grown greyer, O cloud-grey autumn eyes ?
Had my shrunk life slowlier shrivelled dry
From that sad night of July ?
So through my life you lie
(Since one crowned night of July)
As a golden inthreading that one doth see
Run down through an age-dulled tapestry ;
And even the dearest, least semblance of you—
The rarest, remotest resemblance of you—
Is the hand on the censer that circles and swings
The incense of you through my centremost
thought;
For not in that comfortless cloister, my heart,
(I hold) are you penned, O my Whiteness, apart;
But regally here, all-pervasive, unsought,
The wonder that glories you ripples and rings
Through my brain’s most minutest and secretest
cells
Like a mellowing, wind-driven cadence of bells.
Yet, if you had passed me by
(Though gracious) according me
But coldest of finger-tipped courtesy,
Should I have seen it or sorrowed—I —
That idyll-night of July ?

J. ALEX. ALLAN.
Her Escort.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was five past eleven. The out-pouring
theatre crowds were surging down bril-
liantly-lit Bourke-street in an unceasing
confused torrent of men, women, cabs and jangling
trams.
The girl, with her filmy-white skirts well
gathered over her arm and her silken wraps drawn
closely around her, turned off into the compara-
tive darkness and quietness of Russell-street, and
scurried along on the middle of the pavement
towards the station with a nervous little jog-trot
that spoke volumes. She Rad negotiated about
half the way in safety, in spite of the grave terrors
she half-fancied were lurking for her in every dark
shadow, when suddenly a man dashed out of a
dark lane, away down between her and the railway
lights, and, turning up the hill, came straight
towards her. There were few people about, and
she looked at the advancing figure in alarm, and
•doubted whether to cross over and give him that
: side of the road to himself or keep straight on and
••dodge him.
She decided upon the latter, and quickened her
pace.
He advanced with a backward, hunted look, and
•commenced, as he ran, to frantically tear off a
•light overcoat. He did this without in any way
■•slackening his speed, and threw the coat into the
shadow of a warehouse basement. A hard felt
hat followed the coat, and he dragged a cap on in
its place. She could hear his labored panting long
before he got near her.
In her terror and dismay she kept to the ex-
treme edge of the pathway, giving him a wide
berth, and almost breaking into a run herself.
He staggered on, his breath coming in great,
sobbing gasps, and as his wide-open, desperate
eyes fell upon her in p is.-dng, a sudden inspiration
of hope seemed to flash upon him. And as she
saw his face a great pity and curiosity came over
the girl in spite of her nervousness. What had
the poor wretch done to make him run like that ?
And then her blood seemed to freeze within her,
for he turned suddenly in his mad career and came
quite close to her, and commenced to walk back
at her side, with stumbling, staggering steps, the
way he had come.
For the moment she was too paralysed with
terror to shriek or run away.
“Madam,” he panted, holding her arm. “No,
don’t stop—and don’t be frightened—there’s no
harm for you. I’m a poor devil throwing myself
upon your mercy and kindness —I’m run to earth
—and they’re nearly upon me. Give me a chance.
Let me walk quietly down with you to the station,
and I think I can shake them off the scent doub-
ling back like that. If not, you can give me up —
for I’m done —but don’t be frightened. Do just
as you please,” he added, more gently, freeing
her arm. “Oh God!” he muttered, under his
breath, “ here they come.”
In spite of her fright, something made her
hesitate to raise an alarm.
“Is it something very bad?” she whispered,
fearfully, between her chattering teeth, looking
from him to the rapidly advancing figure.
“As bad as can be,” he said, briefly, meeting
her eyes.
She looked at him again, still mechanically
walking along, her thoughts in a medley. What
should she do? What was it he had done? Who
wanted him? A thousand conjectures flashed
across her mind. But there was nothing of the
conventional criminal about him. Except for
a certain dishevelment, he was well dressed and
looked appropriately in his place at her side.
And then she looked ahead. Fast coming up the
hill- was the pursuer —no, there were two now—
and there was another just dashing around the
corner, and among them was the ominous glint of
a helmet. Swiftly the hunted man’s appearance
and the hopelessness of his situation made her
feminine logic prevail against her conscience and
common sense.
“You can try it,” she said huskily, her lips
dry and parched. “Here, carry my things for
me—it will be something,” and she handed over
her opera-glasses and lolly-box. “It’s chilly;
turn up your collar and pull your cap over your
eyes—and perhaps you could smoke.”
He bowed and obeyed her. He got out a cigar-
case, chose a weed, and lit it with care and cool-
ness. They stopped a second or two to allow him
to do so, and thereby gained a few moments, and
then she slipped her trembling hand on his arm,
and it didn’t make her any more at ease to feel
that his heart was beating like a sledgehammer.
What if they were stopped ? What would her
friends say ? How would it all look in big head-
lines in the newspapers to morrow !
A stoutish man, puffing like a grampus, reached
them first.
“ Which way did he go?—man running up this
way”
“ Why, that will be the man we saw,” said the
girl hastily to her companion whose head was
enveloped in a cloud of smoke. “He had on an
overcoat and hard felt hat, and ”
“ Yes, yes !” panted the man, turning to her
eagerly; “that’s him, Miss! Down that lane
over there, you say. Thanks.” And he set off
running again, muttering and groaning, “Oh,
Heaven ! I believe the damn villain’s escaped us
after all.”
“Only two more!” gasped the girl faintly.
But they, seeing their leader punching on ahead
across the road, went steadily on themselves with-
out stopping, and the girl felt almost like crying
with relief, while the man at her side began to
breathe normally again.
They were at the lane from which the chase had
emerged, when a fourth man, tearing around the
corner, ran full tilt into them. The girl screamed
hysterically.
“I beg your” he pantingly began, when
his eyes fell upon the face of the girl’s companion
under the full glare of the arc light, and they
almost started out of his head in amazement as he
stammered, “Richard Kerry—you—by God!”
and he nearly sprang upon him. Then, to her
own horror, the girl broke into a laugh. It came
in so unexpectedly and naturally that the new-
comer hesitated, and looked from one to the other
in growing doubt.
“ What did he call you ? What is the matter?”
she went on, clinging closer to the arm she held.
“Why, he’s drunk, I should say. Never saw
him in my life before,” said the man at her side,
quietly. “ Gues t you’ve made a mistake this time,
old man. Now get out of our road, there’s a good
chap, or we’ll miss our train.”
The pursuer mechanically stood aside in com-
plete bewilderment, and let them pass.
They went on their way swiftly in silence, but
she saw his face was white and haggard, and great
beads of moisture glistened upon his forehead.
“Now, go quickly, for that man is suspicious
and will come after you,” she said as they hurried
along.
“No,” he said, firmly. “You are all alone,
and I am going to see you into your train first.
Yes, yes!” he went on, unheeding her protests.
“By the way, you know, when you are by your-
self you shouldn’t come lonely ways like this to
get to the station —they don’t pay.”
She smiled. He saw it and understood.
“True,” he answered, bitterly. “I’ve put it
out of my power ever to talk like that again,
haven’t I ? What is your train ? ”
“ The 11.20 to Hawthorn. But why won’t you
go and get to safety ? ” She gave a swift glance
behind them. “He hasn’t gone on—he’s still
standing there, looking after us.”
“You’ve just a few minutes to catch it—got
your ticket ? ”
But the girl was giving a last look behind
before they turned the corner.
“ He has made up his mind, and he is running
this way like mad—oh, why don’t you get away
while you can? ”
“Because I’m really safest in the crowd,” he
said, as they walked smartly along, and soon
mingled with the crush about the station en-
trance.
So he saw her to a carriage.
“Good-bye and better luck,” she murmured,
holding out her hands.
He hesitated, and a dull flush came over his
face, while it grew even more worn and haggard.
“No, I won’t give you mine,” he said thickly,
“ for it’s ”
The whistle blew.
“ Shake hands,” she commanded hastily and im-
peratively. “For you are going to get away and
commence everything over again.”
He hesitated no longer, but took her out-
stretched fingers in a feverish grip.
And then, as she glanced at their clasped hands,
she grew cold, sick, faint, and dizzy, for his cuff
and sleeve were stained with blood.
“Oh, what have I done?” she moaned, closing
her eyes, and shutting out the sight. She felt a
last pressure upon her limp fingers—and then
everything seemed rushing along in an indistinct
blur.

SUFFERED FOR 6 YEARS—PRONOUNCED INCURABLE—
ANOTHER BILE BEAN TRIUMPH.
MR. A. J. COOMBS, of Cowper Road,
St. Albans, N.Z., who, as a young
man, had a purpose in life, and is
now enjoying the fruits of his labors,
suffered terribly with his Liver for six
long years. He sought the advice of seven
different doctors, all of whom failed in
their endeavors to cure him. Below he
gives a graphic account of his suf-
fering and ultimate restoration to
joyous health by Bile Beans For
Biliousness.
“For some six years I suffered from
Liver Complaint in an aggravated form,”
says Mr. Coombs. “ I have spent so much
money, consulted so many Doctors, and
tried so many ‘ cures ’ in my vain en-
?
8
30
deavors to get rid of my trouble, that I think it only my duty to inform you of the wonder-
ful cure Bile Beans have wrought in me. lam a man who has worked very hard in my
young days and made money, and when at last I had everything I could wish for, to be
affected by Liver Complaint was, as you can imagine, a great blow to me. I was treated
by seven different Doctors, and spent a large amount of money, but derived only
temporary relief, and was told I should never be cured. It was at this juncture that a
friend advised me to try Bile Beans as a last resource. But I, like a great many
sufferers who had tried other so-called cures in vain, had but little faith in Bile Beans.
However, my friend purchased a box of the Beans, and induced me to undergo a course.
I am pleased to say that after persevering to the extent of ten boxes, I find myself
thoroughly cured. lam now able to enjoy life, and shall be pleased to give particulars
of my case and cure to anyone who may be suffering, as I consider it my duty to let
others know of the great virtues of Bile Beans, a restoration to health after so long an
illness being a blessing I cannot be too thankful for.”
After all else failed, Bile Beans cured Mr. Coombs with signal success. Composed of
Nature’s own vegetable roots and herbs, Bile Beans are the most successful remedy for
biliousness, indigestion, headache, constipation, plies, debility, bad blood and breath, and
all disorders of the functions of the liver, stomach, or digestive organs. Of all

“ \T ou see dot farm down dere ? ” asked
the German. “ Veil, ven I fus’coom to

und get in de lock-up put.
“Furst, I say to meinselluf, I do de vork bad,

“Veil, some time he go to de river to shoot de

Den de bull-ant vas bite him, und he svear again

minutes, und he get mooch eggscited, und his han’

und de ducks say ‘ Quack, quack,’ und fly avay.”
“ Did hfe discharge you then? ” I asked.
“No, de tam pig-face dog, he shoot at me mit
de gun, und dree grains of shot go in mein leg.
He say afder id vas de accident, but I dink he try
to shoot me so dot he save de dree poun’s he owe

Afder dot, I take mein vages by de veek.
“Afder dot some time he vant to make him-
selluf some more money. Der vas un old shed in
de paddock, dot he has insured in de fire-office.
De shed id vas no good, so he try to have it burnt
und get de money. Veil, vun day, ven he dink

selluf to stop id burning his paddock. Ven he vas

‘ Vat, you vant de shed to be burnt?’ Und he
say, ‘ No, no, dot is nod so.’ For he vas afraid of

“ Afder dot some time, he set fire to de grass on
de oder side of de shed. It vas in de night, so
dot nobody vas see him. Soon afder, de breeze

de Velsh he haf to call on de neighbors to help.
To me he say noding, as he dink I am de tam

up und stop de fire from burning de shed again.
De Velsh, he vork like de teufel, und sveat und

Und he chase me mit de pick-handle, und foam at

“ Did he let you go, then ? ” I inquired.
“No; as I vas say, he vas a pig-face dog, dot

Den at las’ he say, ‘ Hans, do you remember dose

“Afder dot some time, de mont’ for de regis-

“ Dot night de Velsh he coom to me und give

Riverine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ITS level lands are spread away
To meet the setting sun ;
Fierce summers o’er them scorch and slay
The grass blades, one by one ;
Long, wicked droughts have dried their breasts,
These virgin lands and clean ;
But still a fertile promise rests
Upon the Riverine,
The fecund Riverine.
It rises, and its worth attests
The Phcenix Riverine.
If breeds no wasters on its lands—
The grim, defiant plains
Are held by strong Australian hands
That firmly grasp the reins ;
Wild horsemen these, who race and wheel
The clustered gums between ;
They keep the stirrup to the heel,
Way down in Riverine,
Far out in Riverine ;
Undaunted souls and hearts of steel,
Are found in Riverine.
No green palms in the Sunlight sway ;
Nor doth the wild, red rose,
In dewy fragrance to the Day
Uncultured charms disclose :
But here and there a garden smiles ;
And when the Spring falls green,
She puts her feet a thousand miles
Across the Riverine,
Along the Riverine.
She wooes, with Amazonian wiles,
Her Lord the Riverine !
Then glutted ewes beside their lambs
Know well the season’s “ good ” ;
To billabongs and creeks and dams
Flocks down a feathered brood ;
Unto a rotund beast hath grown
The packhorse lank and lean ;
The squatter comes unto his own
Along the Riverine,
Across the Riverine.
The stock are fat and sleek and blown
Throughout the Riverine.
A wool-barge, in her steamer’s track,
Swings slowly round the bends ;
Her hawser may not fitly slack
Until the journey ends.
The flood is over reef and sand,
The channel’s wide and clean ;
There’s water in the rivers, and
There’s joy in Riverine,
Hurrah for Riverine !
The shearer and the steamboat hand
Find graft thro’ Riverine.
White snows upon Monaro die ;
Beneath October suns
Warm tropic rains in cowals lie
Along far Queensland runs ;
The ’Bidgee and the Lachlan swell
Their crumbling banks between —
They'll have a record clip to tell
This year in Riverine,
For once in Riverine.
They’re pulling round ; they’re doing well
At last, in Riverine.
I walk dull streets ; and in mine ear
A city’s tumult rings ;
But through my heart a river clear
Beyond the ranges sings,
And visions of the plains come down
The by-ways drab, unclean.
I see the trackless prairies brown
Of dear old Riverine.
God bless the Riverine !
I would that I might shed the town
For you, old Riverine !
There’s strength and effort in the West,
There’s mateship staunch and true ;
(And, sweetheart of my one-time quest,
’Twas there I courted you !)
A blight be on these city ways !
The wastrel and the quean
Can find no place where Manhood lays
Its grip on Riverine,
Its hand on Riverine.
No “ pocket Venus ” loud displays
Her charms in Riverine.
The chiming horse-bells clink and r: ig
From Bourke to Tocumwal !
Around their fires the drovers sing,
The old bush Voices call.
And I must rise and get me gone
To ease my longings keen ;
I’ll saddle up and journey on
Across the Riverine,
And down the Riverine.
I’m sure of welcome warm from One
Who waits in Riverine.
N.s.w.

The Leader of Them All!
That is, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla; not
some other kind, but 1 ‘Ayer’s. ”
This grand old family medicine
has stood the test for over sixty
years. That’s the kind you
should take. You cannot afford
to experiment, your health is
too precious.
You may not now be really ill
from some well-defined disease, and yet
you know you are all run down, your
nerves are unstrung, and you feel weak
and discouraged.
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
is the strongest and best medicine you can
take to remove this tired and exhausted
feeling. It brings cheer, hope, courage.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol.
There are many imitation Sarsaparillas that will disap-
point you. Be sure that you get “AYER’S.”

The Best Modern Definition
of a Windmill
is the
“STEEL WINGS.”
BECAUSE
Its Wind wheel lias a bearing' on
EACH side.
It is storm-proof.
It has a large sail area.
The Balance Gear counteracts the
weight of the pump rod.
And it will prove all this to you
by pumping 50 per cent,
more water than any other mill.
Its price is moderate, and its main-
tenance _ merely the cost of lubri-
cating oil.

RABBIT DESTRUCTION.
“ Currandooley,” Bungendore,
Ttrek- Limited, -4th December, 1908.
Circular Quay West, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —I have now (riven your method of
rabbit destruction a thorough trial, and am pleased
to say that the result has exceeded my expectation.
The cost for clearing- a 360-acre paddock, badly
infested with rabbits, has amounted to a trifle
under 2s. per acre. The same paddock would have
cost £2 per acre to dig'out.
I am satisfied that this cost can be considerably
reduced by using your latest “Perfection”
machine. I am therefore getting two of these to
work in conjunction With the plant already on the
ground, and will let you have the result in a few
weeks. Yours faithfully,
